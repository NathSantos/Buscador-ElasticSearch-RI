An experiment was carried out with\nsoybean (Glycine max) in rotation with triticale (X Triticosecale) and sunflower\n(Helianthus annuus) in fall-winter associated with pearl millet (Pennisetum\nglaucum), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) or sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) in\nspring.  Crop rotation under no-till was compared with mechanical chiseling.  The\nexperiment was carried out in Botucatu, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil.  Soil quality was\nestimated using the S index and soil water retention curves (in the layers of 0\u20130.05,\n0.075\u20130.125, 0.15\u20130.20, 0.275\u20130.325, and 0.475\u20130.525 m deep).  Crop rotation and\nchiseling improved soil quality, increasing the S index to over 0.035 to a depth of\n20 cm in the soil profile.  The improved soil quality, as shown by the S index, makes\nthe use of mechanical chiseling unnecessary, since after 3 years the soil physical\nquality under no-tilled crop rotation and chiseling was similar.\n\nIndex terms: cropping systems, soil compaction, tillage, soil quality\n\nRESUMO:      RETEN\u00c7\u00c3O DE \u00c1GUA NO SOLO E \u00cdNDICE S INFLUENCIADOS\nPOR ROTA\u00c7\u00c3O DE CULTURAS E ESCARIFICA\u00c7\u00c3O\n\nA compacta\u00e7\u00e3o do solo pode ser corrigida mecanicamente ou usando esp\u00e9cies vegetais\ncom sistema radicular vigoroso.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1927-1937, 2011\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe development of compacted layers in\nagricultural areas, caused either by external pressure\nof machine or animal traffic (Lima et al., 2004) or by\nnatural soil particle consolidation (Dias Jr., 2000), has\nbecome a common problem (Andreola et al., 2000;\nSpera et al., 2004).  A possibility to improve the soil\nstructural quality would be the use of crop rotation of\nspecies with vigorous root systems, able to grow\nthrough soil layers with high penetration resistance,\nand creating pores through which the next crop roots\ncan grow (Silva &amp; Rosolem, 2001).  Cover crops are\nspecies planted before or after cash crops to keep\nnutrients from leaching, soil from eroding, and land\nfrom being overgrown by weeds.  Important benefits\nhave been observed in soil structure, both in the short\nand long term, when cover crops with voluminous\nand aggressive root systems are used (Dias Jr., 2000).\n\nAn adequate assessment of the soil physical quality\nshould include different properties that characterize\nthe physical environment plants are exposed to (Silva\net al., 1994).  Dexter (2004) considered that the soil\nwater retention curve (WRC) could be used as an\nindicator of soil physical quality, and therefore\nproposed the S index.  The S index corresponds to the\nangular coefficient (slope of the tangent) at the\ninflection point of the retention curve that can be fitted\nusing the model proposed by van Genuchten (1980).\nSeveral soil properties such as texture, compaction,\norganic matter content and root growth were\ncorrelated with the S index, and it was concluded that\nS &lt;0.020 indicates soil with high physical restriction,\n0.025 &lt;S &lt;0.035 indicates unfavorable and S > 0.035\nfavorable soil conditions for root growth (Dexter, 2004).\nFor Andrade &amp; Stone (2009), the threshold of S = 0.045\nseems to be appropriate to separate soils with good\nstructural conditions from degraded soils, while S ?\n0.025 identifies soils with complete physical\ndegradation.  Tormena et al. (2008) and Cavalieri et\nal. (2009) also found a direct relationship between\nincreasing soil density and reduction in S index.\nAndrade &amp; Stone (2009) reported a positive correlation\nbetween macroporosity and the S index as well,\nindependent of the soil texture class, showing that\nthis is an appropriate indicator of soil physical quality.\nThus, the objective of this study was to determine the\neffect of crop rotation of cover crop species in no-till\n\nand chiseling on soil water retention curves and on\nthe improvement in soil physical quality, as\ndetermined by the S index.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nThe experiment was carried out in Botucatu, State\nof S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, from 2003 to 2006, on a clayey\nRhodic Nitosol (FAO, 1990) or \u201cNitossolo Vermelho\u201d\ndistrof\u00e9rrico (Embrapa, 2006), in an area (22\u00b049\u2019 S,\n48\u00b025\u2019 W; 786 m asl) where soybean/black oat/corn/\ntriticale had been sown in no-tillage rotation as of 1997.\nThe climate was classified (K\u00f6ppen, 1931) as CWa,\ni.e, a subtropical, humid climate with dry winters.\nThe dry season from May to September is well-defined.\nMean rainfall is approximately 1400 mm, the highest\nmonthly mean temperature is over 22 \u00b0C and the\nlowest below 18\u00b0C.  Before the experiment began in\nApril 2003, a 1 m deep trench was opened, and a\ncompacted layer was detected 0.05\u20130.20 m deep.  The\nsoil was sampled for chemical (Raij et al., 2001) and\nphysical analyses (Smith &amp; Mullins, 1991) (Table 1\nand Figure 1).  Soil mechanical penetration resistance\n(PR) was evaluated throughout the profile using an\nelectronic penetrograph.\n\nTreatments consisted of the crops triticale (X\nTriticosecale Wittmack) and sunflower (Helianthus\nannuus) in the fall-winter period, combined with pearl\nmillet (Pennisetum glaucum L., var. BN-2), forage\nsorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) and sunn\nhemp (Crotalaria juncea L.) in the spring as cover\ncrops, and an additional treatment with chiseling, all\nof which preceded soybean (Glycine max L., Merrill),\nvar.  Embrapa 48.  This crop sequence was repeated\nfrom 2003 to 2006.  Mechanical chiseling was carried\nout in September 2003 using a chisel plow with seven\nshanks set on two bars and spaced 0.60 m from each\nother, resulting in an effective 0.30 m between-drill\nspacing.  The shanks were inclined forward forming\na 25o angle with an effective action depth of around\n0.30 m.  A cylinder was attached to the equipment to\nbreak up the biggest clods and smooth the soil surface\nin order to avoid harrowing.  The soil was chiseled on\nonly one occasion, that is, after harvesting the fall-winter\ncrops in the first year (September 2003); these plots\nwere left fallow between the winter and summer crops.\n\nde 0\u20130,05, 0,075\u20130,15, 0,15\u20130,20, 0,275\u20130,325 e 0,475\u20130,525 m.  As rota\u00e7\u00f5es de culturas e a\nescarifica\u00e7\u00e3o melhoraram a qualidade do solo, aumentando o \u00edndice S acima de 0,035 at\u00e9\n0,20 m no perfil do solo.  Entretanto, a melhoria na qualidade do solo, conforme determinada\npor meio do \u00edndice S, n\u00e3o justifica o uso de escarifica\u00e7\u00e3o mec\u00e2nica, uma vez que as parcelas\nsob rota\u00e7\u00e3o de culturas em semeadura direta mostraram qualidade f\u00edsica do solo semelhante\nap\u00f3s tr\u00eas anos.\n\nTermos de indexa\u00e7\u00e3o: sistemas de produ\u00e7\u00e3o, compacta\u00e7\u00e3o, manejo do solo, qualidade do solo.\n\n\n\nSOIL WATER RETENTION AND S INDEX AFTER CROP ROTATION AND CHISELING                   1929\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1927-1937, 2011\n\nUndisturbed soil was sampled prior to the\nexperiment (in April 2003) and prior to soybean sowing\nin the first and third year of the experiment (before\nsoybean sowing).  Trenches (0.30 x 0.60 m, depth\n0.60 m) were dug and samples collected from the walls\n(layers 0\u20130.05, 0.075\u20130.125, 0.15\u20130.20, 0.275\u20130.325,\nand 0.475\u20130.525 m) using volumetric cylinders (height\n0.050 m, internal diameter 0.048 m).  Immediately\nafter sampling, the cylinders were sealed with plastic\nlids.  The characteristic soil water retention curves\n(WRC) were determined as proposed by Embrapa\n(1997).  Briefly, undisturbed soil samples were placed\non plastic trays with water to saturate.  After\nsaturation, they were subjected to tensions of 20, 40,\n60, 100, 333, 1000, 5000, and 15000 hPa.  A tension\ntable was used to obtain matric potentials (?m) of\n-20,-40 and -60 hPa, and matric potentials of -100,\n-333, -1000, -5000, and -15000 hPa were obtained using\na Richards chamber (Klute, 1986).  The amount of\nwater retained in the soil at each potential was\ndetermined by weighing the samples at the saturation\npoint and when hydraulic equilibrium was reached.\n\nAfter the water had been extracted at 15000 hPa,\nthe sample was weighed and dried at 105 \u00b0C for 48 h\nin a forced air oven.  Then the dry weight of the\nsamples was determined.  After obtaining the\ngravimetric moisture at each matric potential, the\nWRC was determined by fitting the original data to\n\nThe experiment was set up in a randomized complete\nblocks in a split-plot design with four replications.  Triticale\nand sunflower were planted on the main plots.  Sub-\nplots were cropped to pearl millet, forage sorghum and\nsunn hemp or were mechanicaly chiseled.  Sunflower\nrows were spaced 0.51 m, and triticale 0.17 m apart.\nPearl millet, sorghum and sunn hemp rows were spaced\n0.17 m apart.  Soybean was planted in rows spaced\n0.45 m and fertilized with P and K.  Sunflower and\ntriticale were not fertilized and the cover crop species\nwere fertilized at planting with 40 kg ha-1 N (urea).\n\nTable 1.

The equation considers the matric potential\n(?) as independent and the gravimetric moisture (?)\nas dependent variable.\n\n? = ?r + ((?s - ?r) / (1 + (??)n)1-1/n) (1)\n\nwhere ? = soil gravimetric moisture at each matric\npotential (kg kg-1); ?r = soil gravimetric moisture at\nthe matric potential of -15000 hPa (kg kg-1); ?s =\nsaturated soil gravimetric moisture (kg kg-1); ? =\nmatric potential (hPa); ?, n = coefficients of the equation.\n\nThe S index, i.e., the angular coefficient of the soil\nwater retention curve, was determined using\nequation 2, which is derived from equation 1 as\nproposed by Dexter (2004).  The index S modulus was\nused to discuss the results.\n\nS = -n(?s - ?r))((2n-1)/(n-1))((1/n)-2) (2)\n\nwhere S = angular coefficient of the water retention\ncurve at the inflection point; ?r = soil gravimetric\nmoisture at the matric potential -15000 hPa (kg kg-1);\n?s = saturated soil gravimetric moisture (kg kg-1); n\n= coefficient of the water retention curve in the soil\n(Equation 1).\n\nThe water retention curves were fit using SWRC\nsoftware (Dourado Neto et al., 1990) and tested using\nthe F test (p &lt;0.05) (Tables 2 e 3).\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe soil of the experimental area was structurally\ndegraded in the subsurface below 0.075 m, causing\nphysical restrictions for root growth in the profile\n(Dexter, 2004).  The physical restrictions resulted from\nthe high penetration resistance (PR), soil bulk density\n(BD), and macroporosity below 0.10 m3 m-3 (Table 1),\nconsidered limiting for optimum plant growth, and\nthe angular coefficient (S) below 0.035 (Figure 1).\n\nThe highest soil water retention between\nsaturation and -60 hPa in the 0\u20130.05 m layer was\nobserved after the triticale plus pearl millet treatment\n(Figure 2a), at the end of the first year of the\nexperiment, indicating higher total porosity and\nmacroporosity (Reichardt &amp; Timm, 2004).  According\nto Reeve &amp; Carter (1991), compacted soils are\ncharacterized by lower water retention at low tensions\n(0 to 100 hPa), resulting from decreased porosity,\nmainly of the macropores, which are filled with\ngravitational water at the highest matric potentials\n(less negative).  Conversely, an increase in water\nretention is usually observed at the lower potentials\n(more negative) as result of increased micro porosity,\nincreasing the capillary water volume.  Therefore, the\nwater curve of soils with this characteristic has a lower\nS index, that is, the angle of the tangent passing\nthrough the inflection point is smaller (Dexter, 2004).\n\nThe water retention curve, in the treatment with\ntriticale and pearl millet, was typical of less compacted\nsoil in 0\u20130.05 m (Reichardt &amp; Timm, 2004) and had\nthe greatest S value, i.e., S = 0.051, similar to the\nvalue of 0.055 obtained by Cavalieri et al. (2009) in\nthe 0\u20130.10 m layer in a soil under long-term no-tillage\nin Paran\u00e1, Brazil.  The only treatment resulting in\nan S index lower than 0.035 was sunflower and\nsorghum (Figure 3a).  Dexter (2004) concluded that\nthe S index was directly and indirectly related with\nsoil organic matter and soil compaction, respectively.\nThus, a higher S index value indicates a better soil\nstructural quality.\n\nGreater water retention at low tensions was\nobserved again by the WRC in the triticale plus pearl\nmillet treatment, in the layer 0.075\u20130.125 m\n(Figure 2b), indicating a greater volume of macropores.\nAt this depth, when triticale was planted in chiseled\nplots, a WRC with characteristics of less compacted\nsoil was also observed.  Saturated soil moisture was\nhighest in this treatment, in other words, total porosity\nwas greatest, water retention at medium and high\ntensions lower (over 100 hPa) and the proportion of\nmicropores decreased.  Another indication of minimized\nsoil compaction in plots with this treatment was the\nlower water retention at the permanent wilting point\n(PWP), that is, at the -15000 hPa matric potential.  An\nincrease in soil bulk density may increase water\nretained at the PWP (Cavalieri et al., 2006) because\nafter exposure to a tension of 15000 hPa, the remaining\nsoil water is in a thin film, retained by adsorption\n(with high energy) around the soil colloids (sheet water).\n\nWhen the S index was applied to study the soil\nstructural degradation in the 0.075\u20130.125 m layer\n(Figure 3b), it was observed again that triticale plus\npearl millet or triticale plus chiseling enhanced the\nsoil physical quality in the very first year of the\nexperiment, since the S values were highest in these\ntreatments (0.054 and 0.055, respectively).\n\nIn the 0.15\u20130.20 m soil layer, greater soil\ncompaction was observed in plots with sunflower plus\nsunn hemp, since the water content was lower in\nsaturated soil (Figure 2c), leading to the lowest S index\nvalue 0.017 (Figure 3c), which was very close to that\nobserved in the first year of the experiment, S = 0.015\n(Table 1).  According to Dexter (2004), S values below\n0.020 are associated with very poor soil physical\nproperties.  On the other hand, growing triticale on\nchiseled plots resulted in a typical WRC of less\ncompacted soils in this layer (Figure 2c).  Although it\ndid not increase the soil maximum water retention\ncapacity, this treatment reduced the water retained\nin micropores, i..e, in matric potentials below -60 hPa.\nFurthermore, in this treatment the lowest soil\nmoisture was detected at PWP, resulting in a greater\nS value (S = 0.040) in the first year (Figure 3c).  For\nDexter (2004), an S value of 0.035 is the minimum\nthreshold to characterize good soil structure quality.\nHowever, in the tropical soils of Brazil, this condition\n\n\n\nSOIL WATER RETENTION AND S INDEX AFTER CROP ROTATION AND CHISELING                   1931\n\nR. Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1927-1937, 2011\n\nwould only be met with S values over 0.045 (Andrade\n&amp; Stone, 2009).  The higher S value defined by\nAndrade &amp; Stone (2009) was related to the narrower\nlimits for bulk density, macroporosity, total porosity\nand the relationship between macro and micropores\nfor better plant growth assumed by these authors.\n\nIn the 0.275\u20130.325 m layer, the WRC observed under\ntriticale plus pearl millet (Figure 2c) characterized a\n\nsoil with poor structural quality, with the lowest S\nvalue, 0.019 (Figure 3d).  Thus, it can be inferred that\nwith only one crop of pearl millet in succession to triticale,\ni.e , a rotation involving only monocotyledonous\nspecies, the cultivation effect on the soil structure was\nlimited to the first 0.20 m of the soil profile.\n\nTreatment effects on the WRC were lower in the\n0.475\u20130.525 m soil layer (Figure 2e) and the S values\n\nTable 2.

However, the values were higher than\nthose determined in the previous year, by the time\nthe experiment began (S = 0.013), when the soil\nstructural quality was even worse.  This improvement\nmay be a result of the better soil management from\nthe beginning of the experiment.\n\nAfter three years, ?s was lowest in the 0\u20130.05 m\nlayer with chiseling (Figure 4a).  This result may be\nrelated to particle reorganization and consolidation,\noccupying the porous space in the absence of root\nsystems, as argued by Calonego &amp; Rosolem (2008),\nbased on data from this same experiment.

Solo, 35:1927-1937, 2011\n\nallows the rainfall to reach the soil with high energy.\nThis leads to soil de-structuring and breaking of\naggregates that migrate to the first millimeters below\nthe surface (1 and 5 mm), where they are inserted\ninto the porous space, forming a layer with high\npenetration resistance (Schaefer et al., 2002).\nFurthermore, the absence of roots increases soil\nsusceptibility to compaction because roots play an\nimportant role in structuring processes by drawing\nthe particles closer when growing in pores and\nreleasing exudates that act as cement in the formation\nof macroaggregates.  The effect of organic matter on\nsoil structure also affects water retention dynamics\nsince it plays an important role in the formation of\nstable aggregates, reducing pore space obstruction and\nincreasing the proportion of macropores.\n\nA decrease in water retention at medium and\nhigh tensions was observed in the 0\u20130.05 m layer from\nyear 1 to the end of year 3, (Figures 2a and 4a),\nsuggesting a decrease in the proportion of small\n\npores, which are responsible for retaining water with\ngreater energy.  According to Reichardt &amp; Timm\n(2004) a gradual increase in tension results in the\ndraining of progressively smaller pores so that at\nthe higher tensions, only very small pores retain\nwater.\n\nThe decrease in water content at the highest tension\n(15000 hPa) in the 0\u20130.05 m layer when cover crops\nwhere grown (Figure 4a) is a clear evidence of soil\nstructuring and reduced soil compaction.  However,\nthere was no increase in the volume of plant-available\nwater (retained at matric potentials between -100 and\n-15000 hPa) because there was also a decrease in the\nwater content retained at field capacity (-10 hPa).\nThis decrease resulted from an increase in the\nmacropore volume, reducing capillary water retention,\nas similarly reported by Cavalieri et al. (2006).  The\neffects of crop rotation and chiseling on soil organic\nmatter at this site reported by Calonego &amp; Rosolem\n(2008) in a previous paper were not significant, varying\n\nFigure 2.

However,\neffects of crop rotation on soil quality, increasing\nsoybean yield, can only be observed in the medium\nand long term, as stated by Calonego &amp; Rosolem\n(2010).  These results were obtained without\nconsidering the fall-winter crop, because S values were\ngreater in treatments including the spring crops\n(Figure 5a), and the S value was highest (S = 0.08) in\ntriticale plus pearl millet.  Interestingly, greatest root\ngrowth (pearl millet and soybean) was observed in\nthis soil layer, as discussed by Calonego &amp; Rosolem\n(2010).  Further comparisons of WRC showed that in\n\nthe first and third year, soil moisture at saturation\nwas increased by cover crops in the 0.075\u20130.125 m\nlayer (Figure 4b).  However, a residual effect of\nchiseling was observed in the sunflower plus chiseling\ntreatment, since water retention was lower between -\n60 and -1000 hPa, showing a reduction in the\nproportion of micropores.\n\nThe treatments triticale plus pearl millet and\nsunflower plus chiseling resulted in the best soil\nstructure in the 0.075\u20130.125 m layer, reflected by the\nhigh S index (0.053 and 0.051, respectively)\n(Figure 5b).  In contrast, S was only lower than 0.035\nfor triticale plus sorghum, i.e, poor structural quality,\nas explained by Dexter (2004).\n\nA residual effect of chiseling on the sunflower plus\nchiseling treatment was also observed in the 0.15\u2013\n0.20 m layer (Figure 4c).

Conversely, sorghum, especially in\nsuccession to triticale, resulted in greater water\nretention at medium and high tensions, indicating\ngreater soil compaction in this layer.  The highest S\nindex value in this layer (Figure 5c) was obtained\nunder triticale plus sunn hemp (S = 0.070), and the\nlowest for triticale plus sorghum (S = 0.040).\n\nThere was lower water retention at tensions over\n100 hPa with chiseling in the 0.275\u20130.325 m layer\n(Figure 4d).  This shows a smaller volume of capillary\nand hygroscopic water, suggesting that chiseling\neffects persisted down to the maximum depth of action\nof the equipment, even after three years, because these\nresults are typical of soils with a lower proportion of\nmicropores.  Triticale plus chiseling resulted in the\ngreatest S value, that is, S = 0.041 (Figure 5d).  The\n\ngreater effect of chiseling on loosening the soil profile\nmay be related to the low root colonization in these\nlayers, which reduces the effects of cover crops on soil\nstructure.  Furthermore, there is less reorganization\nof soil particles in this layer since the loads applied to\nthe surface are dissipated in the first centimeters of\nthe profile, in addition to a lower intensity of the\nwetting and drying cycles, indicating that the soil\nremains moist for a longer time at this depth.\n\nGreat similarity was observed among water\nretention curves in the 0.475\u20130.552 m layer\n(Figure 4e) probably because the roots had little\ninfluence and chisel plow shanks did not reach this\ndepth.  In this layer, the S values calculated ranged\nfrom 0.020 to 0.035 (Figure 5e), which according to\nDexter (2004), indicate poor soil physical quality.\n\nFigure 4.

Bras. Ci. Solo, 35:1927-1937, 2011\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n1. Crop rotation and chiseling improved soil\nquality, increasing the S index to over 0.035, down to\na depth of 20 cm in the soil profile. However, the\ngreatest alterations in the soil physical quality were\nobserved in the 0\u20130.05 m layer and the lowest S values\nwere obtained in the treatments with chiseling and\nwithout cover crops.\n\n2. Cropping pearl millet in succession to triticale\nimproved the soil structural quality to a depth of\n0.125 m from the very first year on, but sunn hemp\nin succession to triticale improved the physical quality\nat a greater depth (0.15 to 0.20 m) after three years.\n\n3. The S values observed after three years did not\njustify the use of chiseling since no-tillage cover crops\nled to similar soil profile improvements.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nThis research was funded by FAPESP (State of\nS\u00e3o Paulo Research Foundation)\n\nLITERATURE CITED\n\nANDRADE, R.
