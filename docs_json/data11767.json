Estas estruturas, actuam \n\nessencialmente como materiais de suporte \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de tecido. S\u00e3o tipicamente \n\nsemeadas com c\u00e9lulas e ocasionalmente com factores de crescimento, \n\nproporcionando desta forma uma matriz extra-celular (MEC) artificial e tempor\u00e1ria para \n\nas c\u00e9lulas formadoras de osso, os osteoblastos. \n\nNano-fibras de policaprolactona (PCL) obtidas por eletrofia\u00e7\u00e3o e hidrog\u00e9is \u00e0 base de \n\np\u00e9ptidos auto-agregantes (self-assembling peptides - SAPs), j\u00e1 demonstraram o seu \n\npotencial para funcionarem como MECs artificiais, capazes de promoverem a ades\u00e3o \n\ne a capta\u00e7\u00e3o celular. A combina\u00e7\u00e3o de ambos os sistemas na forma de um material \n\ncomp\u00f3sito para suporte de c\u00e9lulas em engenharia de tecido \u00f3sseo revelou ser bem-\n\nsucedida. \n\nEste trabalho descreve a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de um novo substituto \u00f3sseo poroso destinado a \n\npromover a penetra\u00e7\u00e3o de osteoblastos. O substituto consiste numa arquitectura 3D \n\ncom camadas alternadas de fibras de PCL com hidrogel, e decorado com sinalizadores \n\nqu\u00edmicos para favorecer a orienta\u00e7\u00e3o celular. Esta estrutura explora a capacidade das \n\nnano-fibras de PCL para imobilizar mol\u00e9culas adesivas, ap\u00f3s um tratamento superfical \n\napropriado, com a possibilidade de introduzir mol\u00e9culas sol\u00faveis, tais como factores \n\nde crescimento, no hidrogel. \n\nO tratamento superficial foi realizado por plasma \u00e0 press\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica, para reduzir \n\na hidrofobicidade das fibras de PCL, resultando num \u00e2ngulo de contacto com a \u00e1gua \n\nde 0\u00ba, demonstrando assim a sua efic\u00e1cia. Este tratamento permitiu a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ngrupos amina capazes de interagir com os grupos alde\u00eddo presentes no fragmento da \n\nvitronectina humana (351-359), uma sequ\u00eancia adesiva que promove a ades\u00e3o \n\nespec\u00edfica de osteoblastos. Os resultados da viabilidade celular demonstraram que a \n\nades\u00e3o celular dependia da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de HVP, n\u00e3o dependendo do tratamento \n\nsuperficial por plasma. Um scaffold decorado com mol\u00e9culas bioactivas ordenadas de \n\nforma a fornecer um gradiente de sinalizadores qu\u00edmicos para as c\u00e9lulas foi montado \n\ne comparado com um scaffold para controlo, o qual n\u00e3o incluiu nenhuma esp\u00e9cie de \n\nmol\u00e9culas bioactivas. Ambos resultaram numa espessura total de cerca de 0,30 mm. \n\nA an\u00e1lise por microscopia confocal revelou que as c\u00e9lulas migraram ao longo da \n\nespessura dos scaffolds at\u00e9, pelo menos, 50 ?m de profundidade, e a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmol\u00e9culas bioactivas mostrou-se ben\u00e9fica em termos de prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o celular. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\n \nScaffolds for bone regeneration, electrospinning, hydrogels from self-assembling \npeptides, cell adhesion. \n \n \n \n Abstract \n\n \nScaffolds for Tissue Engineering (TE) represent nowadays the leading strategy for \n\nbone reconstruction and regeneration therapies. The scaffolds essentially act as \n\ntemplates for tissue formation and are typically seeded with cells and occasionally with \n\ngrowth factors, providing a temporary and artificial extra cellular matrix (ECM) for bone-\n\nformation cells - the osteoblasts. \n\nPolycaprolactone (PCL) nanofibres obtained by electrospinning and hydrogels from \n\nself-assembling peptides (SAPs) have already demonstrated their potential as artificial \n\nECM capable to promote cell attachment and uptake; and the combination of both \n\nsystems as a composite material has been shown to provide successful results in \n\nsupporting cells functions in bone TE. \n\nIn this work, the bottom-up production of a novel bone substitute construct intended to \n\npromote osteoblasts penetration is described. The substitute is composed by a multi-\n\nlayer scaffold with alternated layers of electrospun PCL fibres and hydrogels from SAPs \n\nin a 3D architecture decorated with appropriate chemical guidance cues. This structure \n\nexplores the advantages of PCL nanofibres to immobilize adhesive molecules after an \n\nappropriate surface treatment, and the possibility of hydrogels to incorporate soluble \n\nmolecules, such as growth factors.  \n\nSurface treatment done by atmospheric pressure plasma efficiently reduced the \n\nhydrophobicity of the PCL matrices, resulting in a water contact angle of 0\u00ba. This \n\ntreatment allowed the deposition of functional amino groups able to interact with the \n\naldehyde groups presented in the fragment of human vitronectin (351-359), an \n\nadhesive sequence that promotes the specific adhesion of osteoblast-like cells. Cell \n\nadhesion results, demonstrated that cell attachment is concentration-dependent of the \n\nHVP molecule, and does not depend on the plasma surface treatment itself. A \n\nfunctionalized scaffold decorated with bioactive molecules orderly disposed in a \n\ngradient, was assembled and compared with a control scaffold, which did not comprise \n\nany type of biofunctionalization. Both resulted in a thickness of around 0.30 mm. \n\nConfocal microscope analysis showed that cells could migrate, at least, to a depth of \n\n50 ?m for both scaffolds, presenting a higher proliferation in the functionalized one, \n\nsuggesting the efficiency of the bioactive molecules to sustain the cellular viability.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n

With the gain of \n\nlife expectancy, the need for new therapies becomes fundamental to respond to age-related widespread \n\nconditions such as obesity, bone disorders, and allied pathologies.1 Respecting to bone disorders, osteoporosis \n\nis by far the most common bone disease, representing worldwide a huge personal and economic toll. This \n\nproblem is characterized by compromised bone strength predisposing to an increased risk of fracture that, \n\nconverted in numbers, represents more than 8.9 million fractures annually, portraying one of the major causes \n\nfor disability in Europe.2 The capability for bone to regenerate and repair itself represents an important \n\nmechanism to overcome these adversities. However, the bone structure gradually loses its valence over time, \n\nrequiring even surgical interventions when the fractures reach a critical size. Traditionally, surgery for bone \n\ntissue reconstruction opts for the most common reconstructive and repair strategies \u2013 the use of bone grafts or \n\nimplants. There are three main types of bone grafts: autografts, allografts, and bone graft substitutes. \n\nNonetheless, despite the success of these therapeutic solutions, some drawbacks have been pointed out. \n\nConcerning the autografts, it disadvantages lays in the limited availability and the fact of mandating an \n\nadditional surgical procedure with associated donor-site morbidity, risk of infection, and additional cost. In its \n\nturn, allografts lack the osteoactive capacity of autografts and carry the risk of infectious agents or immune \n\nrejection. To overcome these limitations, Tissue Engineering (TE) appears as an outstanding alternative for the \n\ntreatment of traumas that can lead damage and degeneration of tissues in the human body.3,4 \n\nRegenerative and Reparative Medicine (RRM) encompasses tissue engineering and biomaterials in the \n\nsearch for new health solutions. The principle of TE relies extensively on the use of three-dimensional (3D) \n\nporous matrices, commonly known as scaffolds. Nowadays, TE scaffolds are the leading technique of repair \n\nand regeneration of bone defects. These scaffolds essentially act as a template for tissue formation and are \n\ntypically seeded with cells and occasionally growth factors. They should allow cell\u2019s rapid integration and \n\ncoalescence into the needed tissue and, hence, start the bone regeneration process. Apart from serving as a \n\ntemporary and artificial extra cellular matrix (ECM) for growing cells which degrade overtime; scaffolds can \n\nbe used as a reservoir to deliver bioactive agents to promote regeneration of the injured tissues. An ideal bone \n\ngraft or scaffold should be made of biomaterials that imitate the structure and properties of natural bone ECM, \n\ninclude osteoprogenitor cells and provide all the necessary environmental cues found in natural bone. 5 Even \n\nthough the advances in developing new biomaterials for applications in bone substitutes has been steeply \n\nincreasing, yet none biomaterial hold all the ideal characteristics. A successful bone substitute must exhibit \n\nbiocompatibility and bioresorbability, possess other essential biologic properties, including selective osteogenic \n\npotential, high levels of osteoinductivity and vascularization, good osteoconductivity and integration with host \n\ntissue, also known as osseointegration, and be cost-effective. The problems with the current scaffolds and tissue \n\nengineered constructs are usually related with their limited osseointegration and lack of vascularity.4,6 \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n\n \n\nConverging nanotechnology into TE has provided the ability for materials to be tailored to tune with ECM \n\nmechanical and physical properties, and to be designed at their molecular level. It represents an important factor \n\nin constructing and processing the future composite and integrated materials. Materials with appropriate \n\nphysical characteristics such as high porosity and interconnectivity have been designed and engineered to \n\nfacilitate material/cell interactions, nutrient/oxygen infiltration, and vascularization. Furthermore, the \n\nincorporation of ECM proteins or ECM-derived peptides or protein fragments which engage integrins and direct \n\nosteoblast adhesion and differentiation, has given biomaterials a fundamental tool to signal and manipulate cell \n\nbehaviours towards tissue formation.  \n\nOne of the most evolving strategies for producing bone substitutes is through the using of composite \n\nscaffolds. Electrospun fibres and hydrogels are examples of polymeric structures commonly used as scaffolds. \n\nElectrospun fibres have been widely used in TE as scaffolds for cell culture due to their unique biomimetic \n\nproperties characterized by interconnected porous structure with high porosity, high surface area, fibre \n\ndiameters in the sub-micron range, variable pore size distribution, versatility in materials selection, \n\nreproducibility, and the ability to be tailored into a variety of sizes and shapes.7 Hydrogels greatest property \n\nrelates with their degree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue due to their large water content. They are \n\ncapable to mimic the physiochemical and biological properties of natural ECM of tissues such as cartilage and \n\nbone. The low level of bioactivity of electrospun fibres represents its major disadvantage, while hydrogels most \n\ncommon problem is regarding their poor mechanical properties.8 Hydrogels reinforced with electrospun fibres \n\nrepresents an outstanding strategy with potential for bone regeneration due to the merging of both unique \n\nproperties. Moreover, combining these two systems into a scaffold provides a solution to overcome their \n\nindividual limitations.  \n\nElectrospun fibres can be produced through a wide range of materials. Polycaprolactone (PCL) \n\nnanofibres are now commonly used due to their properties viable for biomedical applications.9 PCL fibres in its \n\norigin offer a hydrophobic environment that cannot favour cell functions. Since osseointegration and long-term \n\nsuccess of the implant are determined by the complex reactions taking place at the tissue-material interface, \n\nPCL fibres require surface modifications. Molecular processes driving cell adhesion and growth have focused \n\nthe treatment of implant surfaces on improving the surface-to-cells interaction, complying with the new \n\napproach of \u201cbiochemical functionalization\u201d. Most promising approach involves the decoration of surfaces of \n\nthe implant with adhesive sequences or osteogenic growth factors.1 In its turn, hydrogels can be produced using \n\nself-assembling peptides (SAPs). Hydrogels from self-assembled peptides have a potential to serve as synthetic \n\nextra cellular matrices.10 Their excellent properties can offer three-dimensional supports for cell growth, and \n\ncan become vehicles for the delivery of stem cells, drugs, or bioactive proteins. This can be explained by the \n\nunusual stable structures that some peptides form when self-assembled, such as ?-sheets structures. Many SAPs \n\nhave been designed as ?-sheet peptides. SAPs with ?-sheet structures have repeated alternating hydrophobic \n\nand hydrophilic amino acids along a linear sequence. After ?-sheet formation, this results in two distinct faces \n\nof hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. It is believed that is this hydrophobic character between two ?-sheets \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n\nthat gives the ability to encapsulate guest molecules that also impart in hydrophobic environments (like cells \n\nand some drugs), making SAPs hydrogels viable for cell-penetration and uptake.11 \n\n \n\n1.2 Aim of this thesis  \n\nThe aim of this thesis is to provide a novel bone substitute construct intended to promote osteoblast \n\npenetration. Exploring the advantages of electrospun fibres and hydrogels from SAPs, we aim to design a multi-\n\nlayer composite scaffold by alternating both systems in a 3D structure. The multi-layered scaffold should be \n\nproduced to mimic the natural bone tissue with appropriate porosity to allow all the necessary transport within, \n\nand a suitable environment for cell growth and migration. The design of a nano-fibrous/nano-porous structure \n\nmimicking an ECM environment must be able to reproduce the typical biochemical stimuli characteristic of \n\nlifelike bone regeneration process. These stimuli will be generated through the insertion of matrix-bound \n\nbioactive molecules, such as adhesive molecules, in the nanofibres, and the incorporation of soluble molecules, \n\nsuch as growth factors, in the hydrogels. These two approaches combined along the scaffold aim to create a 3D \n\ngradient intended to signalize and guide bone-forming cells (osteoblasts), when seeded in our structure, to the \n\nplaces needed for ossification. This gradient will be disposed in an orderly manner in such a way to give viability \n\nto cells and sustain their proliferation and migration functions. By addressing these points, besides offering an \n\nin vitro validated prototype for the in vivo studies, we expect to build an innovative multi-layered porous \n\nscaffold decorated with gradient of appropriate bioactive molecules to foster the adhesion and the spread of \n\nosteoblasts throughout the entire volume of the bony support, and, finally, ensure osseointegration, immediate \n\nloading, and long-term success of the implant.  \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Objectives of this thesis \n\n? Produce and morphologically characterize layers of micro- and nanofibres of PCL obtained by \n\nelectrospinning; \n\n? Graft specific functional groups through atmospheric pressure plasma and evaluate their \n\navailability in the chemoselective ligation with adhesive sequences; \n\n? Compare the cellular adhesion on surfaces functionalized with adhesive molecules at different \n\nconcentrations;  \n\n?

Being a specialized tissue in the loading \n\nof forces and stress, bone is an essential supportive structure of the body, characterized by its rigidity, hardness \n\nand regeneration ability. It serves to guard necessary organs, produces blood cells, acts as a mineral reservoir \n\nfor calcium, and maintains acid-base balance. Bone is also responsible to convert the muscle contraction in \n\nmovement of whole body through the formation of the lever system of the body.12 It is a composite material \n\nconsisting of crystals of mineral bound to proteins. This provides both strength and resilience so that the skeleton \n\ncan absorb impact without breaking.13 It is a kind of tissue composed by bone cells and a bone matrix comprising \n\norganic and inorganic components. The mineral-inorganic phase of bone consists of small crystals containing \n\ncalcium and phosphate ions, called hydroxyapatite (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), and this inorganic component constitutes \n\nabout 50% of the total bone weight. This mineral is bound in an orderly manner to a matrix that is made up \n\nlargely of a single protein, type I collagen. Bone consists of 70% inorganic component (mainly hydroxyapatite), \n\n20% organic component, and 10% of water. Collagen type I represents around 90% of the organic content. 14,15 \n\nTo provide the body with a frame that is both light and strong, bones are hollow. Due to the connection of the \n\ncollagen fibres and hydroxyapatite, dense bone is formed. The outer dense shell is called cortical bone, which \n\nmakes up roughly 75% of the total skeletal mass. Inside the cortical shell is a fine network of connecting plates \n\nand rods called trabecular bone, that makes up the remaining 25 percent.13 \n\nBone is a dynamically and highly vascularized metabolized tissue hosting osteocytes (entrapped within \n\nthe bone matrix), osteoblasts (the bone-forming cells) and osteoclasts (cells committed to bone resorption) \n\nhierarchically and spatially organized within the ECM.14 ECM is present in all living tissues. The ECM in bone \n\nis distinguished from the others because of its mineralization. It confers a structural support for tissues, serves \n\nas a site for cell adhesion and determines the mechanical properties of the skeleton. However, it has been \n\nrecently recognized that ECM plays far more dynamic role in regulating cell function and tissue morphogenesis. \n\nIn the context of bone, ECM components can play a role in modulating the assembly of the structural matrix, \n\nparticularly in organizing the process of matrix mineralization. As well, the ECM can bind to extracellular \n\ngrowth factors; cell bound ligands and receptors, and proteases. Bone matrix consists of amorphous and \n\nfibrillary components. The amorphous component is formed by proteoglycans (glycosaminoglycan chondroitin \n\nsulphate and keratin sulphate) and structural glycoproteins (osteonectin, sialoprotein, osteocalcin, binding \n\ncalcium ions). The fibrillary component corresponds to the already mentioned collagen-organic part of the \n\nbone.16 Bone is covered by collagenous connective tissue called periosteum and its inner cavity is lined by \n\nendosteum. Both structures are composed of outer connective tissue layer and inner cellular layer formed by \n\nosteoprogenitor cells (that differentiate into osteoblasts) and pre-osteoblasts. Endosteum is much thinner that \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n\n \n\nperiosteum and ensures the nutrition of bone. It is also source of new osteoblasts which are used for growth and \n\nremodelling of bone.17 \n\nThroughout life, bone is constantly changing in size, shape and position. Two processes guide these \n\nchanges \u2013 modelling and remodelling. Both modelling and remodelling involve the cells that form bone, \n\nosteoblasts, and the cells that break down bone, osteoclasts. In remodelling, there is an important local \n\ninteraction between osteoblasts or their precursors (the cells that will develop into osteoblasts by acquiring more \n\nspecialized functions \u2013 a process called differentiation), and osteoclasts or their precursors. The differentiation \n\nand function are regulated by osteotropic hormones and cytokines.14 Osteogenesis is roughly assumed to \n\nossification by the medical dictionary, i.e., the natural formation of bone. This, together with the modelling and \n\nremodelling stages, encompasses the processes involved in bone\u2019s life span. All these processes are mediated \n\nby osteoblasts, which work in tight cooperation with bone-resorbing osteoclasts.18,19  \n\nOsteoclasts are the principal cells involved in the reabsorption of bone. As bone as being destroyed, \n\nthese cells are committed to remove it, and to make deposition of new bone. This process is named bone \n\nremodelling, and occurs with calcium release.20 When bone is in resorption stage, osteoclasts are located at the \n\nbone surface. They provoke the losing of tissue, creating depressions nominated as re-entrances or Howship\u2019s \n\nlacunaes. Besides the osteolytic function, osteoclasts play an important role in the bone development and growth \n\nby releasing growth factors from the mineralized ECM. Osteoclasts differentiate in contact with the bone \n\nthroughout mononuclear hematopoietic progenitor cells. They can be found in the bone marrow together with \n\nthe cells that generate osteoblasts.  \n\nOsteoblasts are engaged in bone formation, i.e., the production of bone matrix. During the functional \n\nremodelling process of bone structure, regarding the adaption to mechanical forces and stresses, these cells play \n\na fundamental role. They derive from precursor cells that can also be stimulated to become muscle, fat or \n\ncartilage; however, under the right conditions, these cells change (or differentiate) to form new bone. \n\nOsteoblasts are responsible for the process of  mineralization of the osteoid tissue.21 They are mononuclear cells \n\nthat synthesize the organic ECM of bone, including collagen type I alpha 1, osteocalcin, osteopontin, \n\nosteonection, alkaline phosphatases, proteoglycans, as well as growth factors, stored within the bone matrix and \n\nin charge of the regulation of bone growth.20,22 Osteoblasts lay down bone in orderly layers that add strength to \n\nthe matrix. Generally, they line on the bone surface and are called as bone lining cells. Some of the osteoblasts \n\nare buried in the matrix as it is being produced and these are now called osteocytes.14 \n\nOsteocytes are the most numerous cells in bone and are extensively connected to each other \u2013 osteocyte \n\nperilacunar matrix - and to the surface of osteoblasts by a network of small thin extensions. They represent the \n\nmature form of the osteoblast. Very small changes in the shape of the bone can act on the osteocytes, which \n\nproduce chemical signals that allow the skeleton to respond to changes in mechanical loading.23 Figure 2.1 \n\nillustrates all the compartments of bone matrix as well as the cells involved in the bone remodelling process. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 Overview of the cells involved in bone remodelling and the matrix compartments of bone.101 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe recruitment of osteoblasts to the injured sites represents the key to the development of new anabolic \n\nbone remodelling strategies. The principle of this process involves an understanding of molecular mechanisms \n\nthat accommodate the functioning of bone-producing osteoblasts. The recruitment of osteoprogenitors to the \n\nbone surface is an indispensable aspect of bone formation, and modulating this process could offer unique \n\nproperties for anabolic treatment of osteoporosis and other metabolic bone disorders.18 Skeletal morphogenesis \n\ninvolves highly coordinated sequential steps of cell migration, aggregation, condensation and organogenesis. \n\nCell migration is a dynamic process that requires the coordinated formation and disassembly of focal adhesions \n\nand rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. Although the underlying mechanisms in osteoblast lineage cells \n\nare still poorly understood there is evidence that the osteoprogenitors are attracted, together with blood vessels, \n\nby chemotactic factors released from the mould, a process known as chemotaxis.24  \n\nChemotaxis is a fundamental process in which cells migrate directionally when they are exposed to \n\nexternal chemical gradients. Recruitment of osteoblast lineage cells to the sites programmed for ossification or \n\nin need of new bone formation conceivably relies on precisely controlled temporal and spatial chemotactic \n\nnavigation signals. Molecules attracting cells are called chemoattractant or chemokines. Chemotaxis can be \n\npositive or negative respectively whether the cell moves toward an increasing or decreasing concentrations of \n\nchemokines.25 For example, the balance between bone formation and degradation is normally tightly controlled; \n\nhowever, it becomes deregulated, shifting towards more degradation under pathological conditions or during \n\naging, thereby leading to osteoporosis. This tight balance implies the existence of mechanisms coordinating the \n\ndifferentiation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts as well as their migration to locations where they function. This \n\nmechanism is known as osteoclastogenesis and can be described as a process in which the presence of specific \n\ncues can control the differentiation of both precursor cells, avoiding over-degradation. Likely, in inflammatory \n\nresponse, chemotaxis is crucial for macrophages migration in the site of inflammation. In this case, chemo-\n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\nattractants are released by the tissue in the previous phase of coagulation and clot degradation. There are  \n\nmultiple candidate guidance cues that may be involved in the directional migration of osteoblasts and their \n\nprecursors: constituents of the bone matrix, such as fragments of collagen or osteocalcin, complement \n\nfragments, inflammatory cytokines and growth factors that are typically released, activated or produced at sites \n\nof matrix resorption.26 \n\nGrowth factors are polypeptides that can either stimulate or inhibit cellular proliferation, differentiation, \n\nmigration, adhesion, and gene expression. Growth factor\u2019s effects are concentration-dependent. Due to their \n\ncontrol of many biological processes, growth factors are finding widespread use in the regeneration of many \n\ntissue types such as musculoskeletal, neural, hepatic and vascular systems.27,28 Enhance the in vitro and in vivo \n\nefficacy of growth factors passes through incorporating them into polymeric biomaterials (such as hydrogels) \n\nto maintain their stability and control their release kinetics. The release of these factors is then controlled by \n\ndiffusion and/or scaffold erosion or degradation mechanisms. The application of growth factor in delivery \n\nsystems are of utmost importance in the field of tissue engineering, namely, bone and cartilage regeneration.29 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n\n \n\n2.2 Designed Materials for Bone Tissue Engineering \n\nThe term \u2018Tissue Engineering\u2019 was officially coined at a National Science Foundation workshop in 1988. \n\nTE aims to \u201cregenerate damaged tissues instead of replacing them, by developing biological substitutes that \n\nrestore, maintain or improve tissue function\u201d. The regeneration of a whole (or partial) tissue or organ requires \n\na complete understanding of the tissue/organ properties. Knowing their characteristics and transferring them to \n\na structure that will be biologically accepted, constitutes the first criteria to develop a biological substitute with \n\npredictable success. Nowadays, TE scaffolds are the leading strategy of repair and regeneration of bone defects. \n\nTheir construction is mostly based in the advances in materials science, especially in the field of biomaterials, \n\nwhere structures are specifically designed for specific purposes.5 \n\nBiomaterials play a pivotal role towards the design of ideal bone grafts substitutes. Biomaterials can be \n\npolymer-based (natural or synthetic), ceramic-based, metallic-based, and composites. The most accepted \n\ndefinition of biomaterials is currently the one employed by the American National Institute of Health that \n\ndescribes biomaterial as \u201cany substance or combination of substances, other than drugs, synthetic or natural in \n\norigin, which can be used for any period of time, which augments or replaces partially or totally any tissue, \n\norgan or function of the body, in order to maintain or improve the quality of life of the individual\u201d.30 \n\nBiomaterials have passed through an evolution process over time. Three major generations of biomaterials can \n\nbe found: first generation, second generation and third generation. Briefly, the first generation of biomaterials \n\nrelies on the capability of the material to be biologically inert, or bio-inert. They were intended for mechanical \n\nsupport and the major functionality of preventing rejection. This class include metals (e.g., titanium and titanium \n\nalloys), certain synthetic polymers (e.g., PMMA, PEEK), and some ceramics (e.g., alumina, zirconia). The \n\nsecond generation evolved to the new concept of bioactive/bio-resorbable materials. This class is categorized \n\nby materials that, besides the advantages of the 1st generation, can also stimulate regeneration and adopt a \n\nstrongly biomaterial-bone interface form. Synthetic and naturally derived biodegradable polymers, calcium \n\nphosphates, carbonates and sulphates, and bioactive glasses are included in this class. Lastly, the third generation \n\npresents the outstanding and widely studied strategy emerging continuously in the field of regenerative \n\nmedicine. Third generation bone grafts substitutes try to get close to the autograft standard. Integrating the \n\nbioactivity and biodegradability achieved in the second generation, third generation improvements motivate the \n\ndevelopment of biomaterials in modulating the response of host osteoblast and osteoprogenitor cells to the \n\nimplant, inducing biological responses at molecular level. In this category are included the high porous \n\nscaffolds, nanotechnology based strategies, and the cell/gene/growth factor/loaded scaffolds.4 \n\nThe design of 3D biomaterials able to mimic the complex structural and biochemical functions of the \n\nECM is the current and most challenging aim of TE studies. For that reason, the selection of a biomaterial able \n\nto induce and enhance osseointegration, and bone formation is of utmost importance in bone TE. A successful \n\northopaedic biomaterial must support the adhesion, organization, differentiation and matrix mineralization of \n\nosteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells, key factors for optimal osseointegration. The limited osseointegration in \n\nthe current orthopaedic biomaterials represents the major drawback for the success of the current bone \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n\n \n\nsubstitutes. Also, the lack of vascularity in scaffolds and TE constructs is of major concern. The ability for \n\nmaterials to be molecularly designed represents an important factor in constructing and processing the future \n\ncomposite and integrated materials. Bioinspired strategies have included functionalizing implants with ECM \n\nproteins or ECM-derived peptides or protein fragments which engage integrins and direct osteoblast adhesion \n\nand differentiation. Different peptides can be designed to promote cell adhesion to the implanted biomaterial, \n\nproliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis or a combination of effects, what makes them highly versatile tools.15 \n\nThe design of materials still allows the tune with the desired mechanical and physical properties. Materials with \n\nappropriate physical characteristics such as high porosity and interconnectivity have been designed and \n\nengineered to facilitate material/cell interactions, nutrient/oxygen infiltration and vascularization. The capacity \n\nto control the porosity and pore size within a scaffold is of major importance. The porosity should be high \n\nenough to provide sufficient space for cell adhesion, ECM regeneration and minimal diffusional constraints \n\nduring culture. The pore structure should allow even spatial cell distribution throughout the scaffold to facilitate \n\nhomogeneous tissue formation. Ideally, the structures of the scaffold must be highly porous, with open pores \n\nand fully interconnected. Micro-porosity with pores less than 10 ?m is needed for capillary ingrowth and cell-\n\nmatrix interactions. Macro-porosity with pore sizes of 150?900 ?m allows for nutrient supply and waste \n\nremoval of cells grown on the scaffold. Depending upon the cell type, the optimal pore diameters are 20?100 \n\n?m.6,31,32 \n\nOne of the most evolving strategies for producing bone substitutes is through the using of polymeric \n\nscaffolds. Electrospun fibres have been widely used in TE as scaffolds for 3D cell culture due to their unique \n\nbiomimetic properties characterized by interconnected porous structure with high porosity, high surface area, \n\nfibre diameters in the sub-micron range (tuneable between 50 nm and 5 ?m), variable pore size distribution, \n\nversatility of materials selection, reproducibility, and the ability to be tailored into a variety of sizes and shapes. \n\nThe production of 3D network structures from electrospun fibres is intended for mimicking the characteristics \n\nof ECM, where cells can anchor, grow and perform their multiple functions, to bring back to the tissue it natural \n\nfunctionality.33,34 Electrospun fibres can be produced through a wide range of polymers. Various synthetic and \n\nnatural polymers, such as proteins, and the blend of both types can be used. Examples of natural polymers \n\ninclude collagen, chitosan, cellulose acetate, silk protein, chitin, fibrinogen, among others. Typical synthetic \n\npolymers are hydrophobic biodegradable polyesters, such as poly(?-caprolactone) (PCL), poly(lactic acid) \n\n(PLA), poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), polyurethane (PU), the copolymer poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), and \n\nthe copolymer poly(L-lactide-co\u2013caprolactone) [P(LLA-CL)].7 Normally, the fibre diameter of the matrices \n\nconform to the structural properties of the ECM are on the order of 80-500 nm. It has also been reported that \n\nbiocompatibility of a material improves with decreasing fibre diameter. Fibrous scaffolds can be designed \n\ncombining micro- and nano-fibres unto stratified architecture. Alternating micro- and nano-fibres, it can be \n\neasily created an environment to facilitate cellular infiltration into the scaffolds. It has been reported that cells \n\nare able to easily migrate to a depth of about 100 ?m.32 \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nAnother emerging strategy in the field of TE involves the use of hydrogels. Hydrogels are promising \n\nmaterials for bone and cartilage regeneration. Equally, hydrogels present very particular characteristics that \n\nallow them to be used in the biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. It greatest property relates with their \n\ndegree of flexibility very similar to natural tissue due to their large water content. They are capable to mimic \n\nthe physiochemical and biological properties of natural ECM of tissues such as cartilage and bone. Hydrogels \n\nrepresent a group of polymeric materials that can be either from synthetic and natural origins. The porous \n\nstructure of hydrogels enables the transfer of low molecular weight nutrients and cellular waste, which is vital \n\nfor cellular life. In addition, biocompatible and biodegradable hydrogels can direct the migration, growth, and \n\narrangement of cells during regeneration processes.8,35 However, the major drawbacks regarding the use of \n\nhydrogels lays in their poor mechanical properties and low bioactivity, making them inappropriate for hard \n\ntissue.36 To improve their bioactivity, is taken the advantage of hydrogel\u2019s ability to recreate the natural \n\nmechanisms by using synthetic low-molecular weight peptides able to aggregate by spontaneous self-\n\nassembling. SAPs hydrogels are nano-structural materials that can act as nano-fibrous scaffolds with an average \n\nof 10 nm in fibre diameter with pores between 5-200 nm. These structures can be easily functionalized with \n\nchemotactic factors, growth factors or adhesive peptides, providing favourable environments for culturing cells, \n\ntriggering tissue regeneration, and for releasing drugs.37 Moreover, when mixed together with other porous \n\npolymer scaffolds, the peptide scaffolds enhanced osteoblast growth and differentiation.38 \n\nHydrogels reinforced with electrospun fibres represent a revolutionary strategy with potential for bone \n\nregeneration due to the merging of both unique properties. However, only few studies have been reported on \n\nfibrous scaffolds for application in bone TE. In literature is reported a combination where SAPs hydrogels \n\nwere mixed with PCL in solution to produce electrospun fibres. This presents a path to assess the potential of \n\nmodulating the excessive softness of those hydrogels and to add biomimetic molecules to PCL scaffolds. \n\nIndeed, these scaffolds can emulate the natural ECM (for its porosity and water content) and possess improved \n\nmechanical properties due to the fibres ability to reorient under deformation, stiffening, strengthening and \n\ntoughening the system. Danesin, R. et al, proved that the enrichment of fibres with peptides produced higher \n\nsurface wettability, and enhanced h-osteoblast adhesion to maintain osteoblast differentiation and to stimulate \n\nthe expression of several genes.36,39 Khorshidi, S. et al, prepared a hydrogel/fibre scaffold for osteochondral \n\nregeneration, possessing gradient in both phases. In this experiment, they had come with the idea of \n\namalgaming hydrogel and fibres to obtain composites encompassing gradient features to restore osteochondral \n\nmatrix. This idea aims at overcoming the inherent limitations of both individual scaffold systems - the innately \n\nscarce cell migration of fibres and poor mechanical properties of hydrogels. Mehdi-Sahad et al, fabricated a \n\n3D cell-laden three-layered hybrid scaffold incorporating a 2D mat layer of poly(hydroxybutyrate) and nano-\n\nhydroxyapatite fibres (diameter 2.0\u00b10.2 ?m) between two layers of methacrylated gelatin/Hap. All the results \n\nshowed an improvement in the mechanical properties when compared to the hydrogel itself; however, they \n\nwere still inferior to the natural tissue. To overcome this problem, it has been suggested an increasing in the \n\nthickness of the electrospun mat located at the centre of the scaffold. But, this approach would lead to a denser \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n\n \n\nelectrospun mat, with decreased porosity that would potentially hindered cell penetration into the electrospun \n\ncentre.40   \n\n A scaffold designed as the one planned to obtain in this work, presents an original and innovative idea. \n\nFirst, assembling alternating layers of hydrogel/electrospun fibres onto a stratified architecture allows \n\ncontrolling the nano-fibrous structure of both systems in terms of fibre morphology, since their production is \n\ndone individually. The mechanical properties of hydrogels are expected to be improved whatsoever, although \n\nknowing that the loading of the substitute will be far from the mechanic loading exhibited by natural bone. This \n\ntype of combination permits the incorporation of different kind of bioactive molecules:   \n\n (1) Matrix-bound bioactive molecules, as adhesive sequences, decorating the surfaces of the electrospun \n\nmatrices, intended to promote cells\u2019 attachment along the scaffold; \n\n (2) Soluble molecules, as growth factors, embedded in hydrogels, essential for cell growth and \n\nsustainability, where their release will occur mainly by bulk degradation of the material.  \n\n  \n\n2.2.1 Biofunctionalization of surfaces \n\nOsseointegration and long-term success of the implant are determined by its ability to communicate \n\nwith surrounding biological environment. It is of major importance for an implant to be recognized by the host \n\nbiological system and initiate the functions for which it is intended as a part of the natural process. In the design \n\nof a biomaterial, the surface properties should be tailored to maximize the tissue-implant reciprocity, i.e., the \n\ninteraction of the material with proteins. For this reason, bone grafts/substitutes have received specially attention \n\nin surface treatments to improve surface-to-cells interaction. Currently, the most promising approach involves \n\nthe decoration of surfaces of the implant with adhesive sequences or osteogenic growth factors, a process named \n\nbiochemical functionalization, or bio-functionalization, where the presence of these molecules at the surface of \n\nthe implant triggers a series of molecular processes driving cell adhesion and growth.1,41 \n\nActivity and behaviour of osteoblasts contacting material surface, both in vitro and in vivo, are \n\ninfluenced by surface properties such as hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature of the scaffold, surface wettability, \n\nroughness and deformability. Many mechanical and chemical treatments, and combination of both, are thus \n\nperformed to modify surface with opportune characteristics to optimize its biological and mechanical properties. \n\nECM proteins, such as fibronectin and vitronectin, are examples of cell adhesion proteins and are known to \n\npromote osteoblasts adhesion, and, therefore, bone growth. The attachment of osteoblasts to the bone matrix is \n\nmediated by vitronectin receptor.14 In the literature is reported that the FRHRNRKGY peptide mapped on \n\nhuman vitronectin (HVP) selectively promotes osteoblast-like adhesion.42 The peptide reproducing the 351\u2013359 \n\nsequence of human vitronectin increases osteoblast adhesion through a specific mechanism of interaction \n\nbetween cell membrane heparin sulphate proteoglycans and heparin-binding sites of ECM proteins.43 \n\nThere are several advantages and disadvantages when using peptides instead of whole proteins. Proteins \n\noffer higher activity, they are well characterized molecules and are commercially available. However, the \n\nimmobilization of an entire protein on a surface can lead to protein denaturation and loss in the bioactivity. They \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n\n \n\nare more expensive and, biologically, more immunogenic and sensitive, which make them bind with a range of \n\nbiological ligands, losing it specificity. The immobilization of short biomimetic peptides, reproducing the \n\nreceptor binding site of the protein, offers a convenient alternative route. When compared to proteins, peptides \n\nprovide less activity and are poorly characterized, and there aren\u2019t many commercialized products available. \n\nHowever, peptides can be synthesize in a cost-effective way, offering more stable molecules, with high \n\nspecificity and less immunogenic reactions.44 Peptides can be attached to a bioactive surface either by \n\nphysicochemical adsorption or by covalent immobilization. The first method is the simplest one but lacks \n\ncontrol on the quantity and orientation of the adsorbed peptide; this disadvantage can be overcome by covalent \n\nbinding of the selected peptide to the surface through an optimized synthetic procedure. One of the favourite \n\ntechniques for covalent immobilization involves deposition of a silane carrying a reacting functional group that \n\ncan be used to anchor another different molecule. Usually, a further bifunctional molecule (cross-linker or \n\nspacer) is subsequently added to maintain the peptide flexibility. Several authors reported the covalent \n\nimmobilization of RGD-containing peptides on various surfaces by reaction with different silanes and cross-\n\nlinkers.43 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n36 \n\n \n\n2.3 Hydrogels  \n\n Hydrogels were first reported by Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav L\u00edm in 1960. They \n\ninvented polyhydroxyethylmethacrylate, the synthetic material that was later used for soft contact lenses.45 \n\nHydrogel products constitute a group of polymeric materials with interest to biomaterial scientists for many \n\nyears because of their hydrophilic character and potential to be biocompatible. Hydrogels are hydrophilic 3D \n\nnetworks that are recognized by their capability to swell and retain significant amounts of water within it \n\nstructure. During the swollen and water storage process, hydrogel\u2019s structure can be maintained due to chemical \n\nor physical crosslinking of individual polymer chains. Water must constitute at least 10% of the total weight (or \n\nvolume) for a material to be a hydrogel. Hydrogels also possess a degree of flexibility very similar to natural \n\ntissue due to their significant water content. The hydrophilicity of the network is due to the presence of \n\nhydrophilic groups attached to the polymeric backbone, such as ?NH2, ?COOH, ?OH, ?CONH2, ? CONH, and \n\n?SO3H, while their resistance to dissolution arise from crosslinking between network chains. Thanks to their \n\nnotable properties such as versatility in fabrication, tuneable physical, chemical and biological characteristics, \n\nhigh biocompatibility, and similarity to living tissues, hydrogels have been widely used in \n\nbiomedical/pharmaceutical applications.46,47 \n\nHydrogels are mainly formed from biopolymers and/or polyelectrolytes.46 They can be either from \n\nsynthetic or natural polymers. Synthetic polymers that forms hydrogels are traditionally prepared using chemical \n\npolymerization methods. Usually they have well-defined structures that can be modified to yield tailor able \n\ndegradability and functionality. On the other hand, natural hydrogels present long service life, high capacity of \n\nwater absorption, and high gel strength, being the reasons for the gradually replace of the synthetic ones.8,48 One \n\nof the way to produce hydrogels is through the combination with molecular units, like peptides and proteins, as \n\nthe emerging case of hydrogels from SAPs. \n\n \n\n2.4 Hydrogels from self-assembling peptides \n\nPeptides are very versatile building blocks for fabricating supramolecular architectures. Their ability to \n\nadopt specific secondary structures, as prescribed by amino acids sequence, provides a unique platform for the \n\ndesign of self-assembling biomaterials with hierarchical 3D macromolecular architectures, nanoscale features \n\nand tuneable physical properties.49 Peptides offer a great diversity of biochemical (specificity, intrinsic \n\nbioactivity, biodegradability), and physical (small size, conformation) properties to form self-assembled \n\nstructures with different molecular configurations. Self-assembly is a spontaneous process of organization of \n\nchaotic molecular units into ordered structures because of intramolecular/intermolecular interactions, normally \n\nusing processes driven by enthalpy that include Van der Waals, electrostatic, hydrogen bonding, and ?-? \n\nstacking interactions.50 Self-assembly involve the formation of a wide variety of complex biological structures \n\nsuch as actin filaments in the cytoskeleton, the fibrous proteins components of the ECM, DNA, among others. \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\nThese molecules can spontaneously assemble into various nanostructures in aqueous media such as fibres, tubes, \n\nsheets, and spheres.51  \n\nSAPs are highly biocompatible and versatile structures. They may vary in the number of amino acids \n\nstarting from 2 to as high as 20. Once there are the amino acids that form the building blocks, designed SAPs \n\npresent the advantage to incorporate functional molecules on the carboxyl or amine terminal groups, opening a \n\nwide range of possibilities for chemical interactions and modifications. This fact, besides enhancing the design \n\nopportunities when compared to individual components, also leads to functional specificity, since the \n\nsupramolecular organization of the hybrid materials is driven mainly by the bio-recognition of peptide \n\nsegments.52,53 Self-assembling peptide systems undergo a sol-gel transition when brought to neutral pH and \n\nionic concentration. These systems do not use crosslinking agents; hence, they can safely encapsulate cells \n\nand/or drugs without exposing them to toxic agents. Applications of SAPs as nano-biomaterials include carriers \n\nfor drug delivery, hydrogels for cells culture, and tissue repair. Hydrogels from SAPs have a potential to serve \n\nas synthetic extracellular matrices. Their excellent properties can offer 3D supports for cell growth and can \n\nbecome vehicles for the delivery of stem cells, drugs or bioactive proteins. Despite the numerous advantages of \n\nself-assembling peptides, there are several challenges associated with their use in biomedical applications, \n\nwhich include problems related to process, control of size, functionalization, and stability in aqueous medium.10  \n\nZhang, S. first demonstrated the use of SAPs systems in the design of soft materials. Three types of \n\nSAPs have been systematically studied thus far and can be distinguished based on the final secondary molecular \n\nstructure, that can result in ?-sheet peptide, ?-helix peptides, and peptide amphiphiles.42,43 These categories are \n\nnumbered in type I, II and III. Type I self-assembling peptides, also known as \u201cMolecular Lego\u201d, are the ones \n\nof utmost interest for the current report. They form ?-sheet structures in aqueous solution because they contain \n\ntwo distinct surfaces, one hydrophilic and one another hydrophobic. The unique structural feature of these \n\npeptides is that they form complementary ionic bonds with regular repeats on the hydrophilic surface. The \n\ncomplementary ionic sides are classified according to the amino acid ionic pairing and charge distribution of \n\nthe residues. The discovery of such a class of ionic-complementary peptides by Zhang S. was remarkable and \n\ncaught the attention for the fields of biotechnology. The origins of the discovery date many years of investigation \n\nin the field of molecular biology. However, the rising interest dates back in the early 1990s when Zhang showed \n\nthe importance of the Z-DNA, with the discovery of a Z-DNA binding protein, zuotin, in yeast. Analysis of the \n\nZ-DNA binding protein revealed an unusual 16-amino acid sequence (EAK 16-II) with repetitive polar and \n\nnonpolar residues suggesting a new class of SAPs.54 These peptides have been reported to support mammalian \n\ncell attachment and have been used as a scaffold for neurite outgrowth and synapse formation.55,56 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n2.4.1 ?-Sheet peptide \n\nThe ?-sheet is a common motif, and second major type, of regular secondary structure in proteins. ?-\n\nsheets consist of multiple peptide chains that have an extended backbone arrangement that permits hydrogen \n\nbonding between the backbone amides (?NH) and carbonyls. The interactions do not involve side chains thus \n\nmany different sequences can form a ?-sheet, such as self-assembly of peptides into hydrogels. Although these \n\ninteractions are relatively weak when compared to covalent bonds, they form thermodynamically stable \n\nstructures through self-assembly due to lower values of Gibbs free energy when compared to that of the \n\nindividual components (building blocks). Since the underlying interactions are rather weak, any external \n\nstimulus can alter the self-assembled structures. However, once the stimulus is removed, they can revert to their \n\noriginal structure.  \n\nMany SAPs have been designed as ?-sheet peptides, for example, KLD?12 (Ac?(KLDL)4?NH2), \n\nRADA 16?I (Ac?(RARADADA)2?NH2), EAK 16?II (Ac?(AEAEAKAK)2?NH2), among others. Each of these \n\noligopeptides can form a polymeric network of nanofibres rich in ?-sheet secondary structures under well-\n\ndefined conditions, for example, pH and temperature. Alanine-based sequence were the pioneering sequences \n\nand serve as the best model for creating hydrogel-forming systems.10,50,57 SAPs with ?-sheet structures have \n\nrepeated alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids along a linear sequence (Figure 2.2A). This \n\nresults in two distinct surfaces of hydrophobic and hydrophilic character. Hydrophobic interactions play an \n\nimportant role as a primary driving force for self-assembly. Electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds \n\nderived from hydrophilic amino acids contribute to structural specificity. The alternating hydrophobic-\n\nhydrophilic residues assembled into sheets, where two sheets came together to bury this hydrophobic face from \n\nthe surrounding water (Figure 2.2B). Thus, depending on the number of packed sheets, a variety of different \n\nhierarchical structural arrays can be designed, including tapes, ribbons, fibrils and fibres (Figure 2.2C).  \n\nPeptides that form ?-sheets have applications in drug delivery as nanowires, nanofibres or hydrogel \n\nscaffolds, where the ability to encapsulate hydrophobic guest molecules between two ?-sheets enhanced their \n\ncell-penetration and uptake. A ?-sheet is a regular and rigid structure often represented as a series of flattened \n\narrows (Figure 2B). Each arrow points towards the protein C-terminus. ?-sheets can be orientated so that all \n\ntheir C-terminus are at one end of a structure, described as a parallel structure, or so that the N and C terminus \n\nalternates, described as an anti-parallel structure. In both positions, the ?-strands become oriented in such a way \n\nthat alternate amino acid side chains remains at opposite sides of the sheet. Sometimes, the electrostatic and \n\nhydrophobic forces among the amino acids chains stabilize the sheets.57 This has an important impact on the \n\norientation of hydrogen bonds between sheets and side chain orientations and interactions.58  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEAK 16-II is a typical example of \u201cMolecular Lego\u201d peptide that forms fibrillary assemblies at physical \n\npH values. This peptide sequence is composed by a conjugation of 16 amino acids: two charged residues, \n\ninvolved in charge-charge interactions - Glutamic acid (Glu, E) with acidic properties, and Lysine (Lys, K) with \n\nbasic properties; and one aliphatic hydrophobic residue, providing a hydrophobic environment \u2013 Alanine (Ala, \n\nA) (Figure 2.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEAK 16 contains alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues. In this conformation, \n\nall the hydrophobic Alanine residues side chain face in one direction. While the opposite polar face is composed \n\nby Glutamic acid and Lysine residues, negatively and positively charged, respectively. This conformation \n\ncreates two distinct faces. When protonated, the amine groups of the Lysine residues will link with the \n\ncarboxylic groups present in the Glutamic acid residue through ionic complementarity. On the other hand, the \n\nnonpolar side chain establishes hydrophobic interactions, Figure 2.4. This repetitive anti-parallel arrangement \n\nFigure 2.2 Schematic representations of peptides able to form ?-sheets and of the resulting self-assembled \n\nstructures (adapted from Loo, Y., Zhang, S. &amp; Hauser, C.

Instead of exhibiting a hydrophobic tail and a \n\nhydrophilic head like usual surfactants, EAK 16 has a hydrophobic side and a hydrophilic side. This peptide \n\nturns out to form unusual stable form ?-sheets and further stable membrane-like structures upon an addition of \n\nsalts in solution.56 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUpon the introduction of milli molar amounts of monovalent cations (such as Na+, Cs+), either through \n\nthe addition of salt solution, cell culture media or injection of the material in vivo, EAK 16-II undergoes self-\n\nassembly into nanofibres, ~10 nm in diameter, on a scale like the in vivo ECM. EAK 16?II can form a \n\nmacroscopic nano-fibrous membrane resistant to high temperatures, extreme pH values as well as chemical \n\ndenaturants. The resulting EAK 16?II hydrogel exhibits the ability to foster mammalian cell attachment.59 The \n\nphysical size relative to cells and proteins, the amphiphilic peptide\u2019s charge density, and water-structuring \n\nabilities mimic the in vivo ECM as well. These well-ordered nanofibres create 3D porous scaffolds that are very \n\ndifficult or impossible to synthetically produce by other manufacturing techniques. Comparing to Matrigel\u2122, \n\nthese scaffolds have been shown to be more effective in promoting the bone regeneration of calvaria bone \n\ndefects in mice.60 The nanofibre density and average pore size, ~5?200 nm, correlates with the concentration of \n\npeptide solution that is used to produce the material, which can be varied from 0.1 to 3% in water (1?30 w/v \n\n(%)) depending on the application. EAK 16-II not only can be used as a coating or to encapsulate cells similar \n\nto the ECM, but can also be tailor-made for particular cells, tissues and therapies.61  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 Schematic of EAK 16-II self-assembly through hydrophobic interaction and ionic-complementary.56 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\n2.5 Electrospinning and Nanofibres  \n\nFibres are defined, from a geometrical standpoint, as a slender, elongated threadlike object or structure. \n\nJoining this term with the prefix \u201cnano\u201d it can be easily perceptible that the word nanofibres stands for fibres \n\nwhose fabrication technology in which they are designed and built, by the specification and placement of \n\nindividual atoms or molecules, has, at least, one dimension on a scale of nanometers.62 \n\nElectrospinning is a cost-effective attractive technique to synthesize nanofibres from various \n\nbiodegradable polymers due to the simplicity of the technique, ability to effectively control the process, and \n\npotential for scale-up production.32 Although electrospinning has just became a topic of interest to produce \n\npolymeric nanofibres in the lately years, it was observed more than one century ago by Rayleigh (1897) and \n\nfirstly patented by Formhals (1934). The main advantages of electrospinning is it capability to produce long and \n\ncontinuous fibres with micro- and nano-diameters, and their ability to be manipulated to form 3D structures \n\nduring deposition.33,63  \n\n \n\n2.5.1 Electrospinning Process \n\nThe most basic electrospinning setup consists of three major components: a high voltage power supply, \n\nan electrically conducting spinneret and a collector separated at a defined distance, Figure 2.5.64 The most \n\ncommon setup used in laboratory comprise a syringe that holds the polymer solution with a blunt tip needle as \n\nspinneret. The solution can be fed at a constant and controllable rate using the syringe pump.7 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nElectrospinning is a process of creating nanofibres and/or microfibres through the action of an external \n\nelectric field imposed on a liquid polymer solution. The polymer solutions can be either from natural or synthetic \n\npolymers.7,64 When a high voltage (typically in the range of 5-30 kV) is applied to a polymer, the surface of the \n\nFigure 2.5 Basic electrospinning setup (adapted from D. Li and Y. Xia, Adv. Mater. Weinheim, Ger. 16, 1151, \n\n2004).64 \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nfluid droplet held by its own surface tension gets electrostatically charged at the spinneret tip. When charges \n\nwithin the fluid reaches a critical amount, a fluid jet will erupt from the droplet at the tip of the needle resulting \n\nin the formation of a Taylor cone, see Figure 6, and a fine jet ejects from its surface toward the collection plate.  \n\nElectrospinning process comprises three stages: jet initiation, jet elongation and jet solidification.64 The \n\njet initiation stage is characterized by the formation of the already referred \u201cTaylor Cone\u201d. The conical surface \n\nis due to the application of the electric field, inducing a charge on the surface of the drop. This charge offsets \n\nthe forces of surface tension and the droplet changes shape from spherical to conical. When the intensity of the \n\nelectric field attains an adequate value, the electrostatic forces overcome the surface tension of the polymer \n\nsolution and force the ejection of the liquid jet from the tip of the Taylor cone. The electrospinning jet will travel \n\ntowards the region of lower potential which, in most cases, is a grounded collector. Along this drive, elongation \n\nstage occurs. Before reaching the collector screen, the liquid jet elongates, and the solvent evaporates, leading \n\nto the formation of a randomly oriented, non-woven mat of thin polymeric fibres on the collector. The liquid jet \n\nis electrically charged, and the charge causes the fibres to bend in such a way that every time the polymer fibre \n\nloops, its diameter is reduced, Figure 2.6. This fact, known as bending instability, is due to the shifts in the \n\nbalance between surface tension and electrical forces, and changes in the jet trajectory. Initially, the solution jet \n\nfollows a linear trajectory but, at some critical distance from the spinneret orifice, the jet begins to whip out, \n\nand starts following a diverging helical path. The repulsive forces between the charges carried with the jet, \n\nelongate the jet in the direction of its axis until it solidifies.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 Diagram showing onset and development of bending instabilities (adapted from D. H. Reneker and \n\nH. Fong, Polymeric Nanofibres, American Chemical Society, Washington DC, 2005).64 \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\nThe solidification of the jet results in the deposition of a dry nanofibre on the collector. The \n\nsolidification rate varies with the polymer concentration, electrostatic field and gap distance. With the \n\nevaporation of the solvent and posterior solidification of the fluid jet, it is normally observed a mass decrease \n\nand a volume variation. This stage is characterized by strong attachments at crossing points that hence stiffen \n\nthe mat. This is an important factor since it determines the mechanical properties of the structure. After the onset \n\nof bending instability, the jet path may follow a very complicated path, and successive loops of coil may touch \n\nin flight and form permanent connections, Figure 2.7.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n There are many parameters that will influence the morphology of the resultant electrospun fibres from \n\nbeaded fibres to fibres with pores on its surface. Performing electrospinning comprises the understanding of \n\nseveral features which will directly influence that resulting fibre morphology. These features are usually related \n\nto the working conditions in which the technique is undertaken.  \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Effects of working parameters on electrospinning \n\n Working parameters are very important to understand not only the nature of electrospinning but also \n\nthe conversion of polymer solutions into nanofibres through electrospinning. The parameters affecting \n\nelectrospinning and the fibres may be broadly classified into polymer solution parameters, processing conditions \n\nwhich include the applied voltage, temperature, and effect of collector, and ambient conditions. Each of these \n\nparameters can affect the fibres morphologies, and by proper control of these parameters we can fabricate \n\nelectrospun fibres with desired morphologies and diameters.62 \n\n \n\nA. Polymer Solution Parameters \n\ni. Concentration \n\nThe polymers concentration is an important parameter in the solution aspects because it affects both \n\nsurface tension and viscosity of the solution, and the deposition area. For very low concentration, polymeric \n\nmicro- and nanoparticles will be obtained. At this point, electrospray occurs instead of electrospinning because \n\nthe low entanglement of polymer chains cannot withstand the electrostatic charge. As the concentration is \n\ngradually increased, a mixture of beads and thin fibres will be formed along the fibre axis. When the \n\nFigure 2.7 A diagram of a loop in a segment of one fibre and another loop (adapted from Reneker et al., \n\nPolymer 43, 6785, 2002).64 \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\nconcentration is suitable, smooth and more uniform nanoFibres can be obtained. If the concentration is too high, \n\nthe fibre formation will not occur.9 \n\n \n\nii. Molecular Weight and Solution Viscosity \n\nThe molecular weight of the polymer represents the length of the polymer chain, which in turn influence \n\nthe viscosity of the solution. One of the conditions necessary for electrospinning to occur where fibres are \n\nformed is that the solution must consists of polymer of sufficient molecular weight and the solution must be of \n\nsufficient viscosity. As the jet leaves the needle tip during electrospinning, the polymer solution is stretched as \n\nit travels towards the collection plate. During the stretching of the polymer solution, it is the entanglement of \n\nthe molecule chains that prevents the electrically driven jet from breaking up thus maintaining a continuous  \n\nsolution jet. As a result, monomeric polymer solution does not form fibres when electrospun.65 Keeping the \n\nconcentration fixed and lowering the molecular weight of the polymer tends to form beads rather than smooth \n\nfibres. Increasing the molecular weight, smooth fibres will be obtained. When the viscosity of the solution is \n\ntoo low, electro-spraying may occur. A way to increase the viscosity of the solution is to increase the polymer \n\nconcentration. During electrospinning, there may be secondary jet erupting from the main electrospinning jet \n\nwhich is stable enough to yield fibres of smaller diameter at certain viscosity. This may explain the differential \n\nfibre diameter distribution observed in some cases. However, when the viscosity is high enough, it may \n\ndiscourage secondary jets from breaking off from the main jet which may contribute to the increased fibre \n\ndiameter.7 \n\n \n\niii. Surface Tension \n\nThe initiation of electrospinning requires the charged solution to overcome its surface tension. The jet \n\nstretching already reported is caused by the influence of solution surface tension in the drops and, consequently, \n\nthe cause of fibres formation. As the jet travels towards the collection plate, the surface tension may cause the \n\nformation of beads along the jet. Surface tension has the effect of decreasing the surface area per unit mass of a \n\nfluid and is directly affected by the temperature. For a pure liquid system, the surface tension of the liquid would \n\ndecrease with increasing temperature.33,66  \n\n \n\niv. Polymer Solubility \n\nThe structure of the polymer has an impact on its solubility in the solvent. Generally, a polymer with \n\nhigher molecular weight is less soluble and takes much longer to dissolve than one with a lower molecular \n\nweight using the same solvent. Crystallinity of the polymer measures the degree of orderliness of the polymer \n\nchain packed within the bulk. Polymers of higher crystallinity has lower solubility as the solvent molecules have \n\ndifficulty in penetrating the interior of the polymer bulk.62,67 \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nv. Volatility (Evaporation) of the solution \n\n The type of solvent is important to determine the ability of fibre forming. When most of the solvents \n\nhave evaporated when the jet reaches the collector, individual fibres are formed. If the ejected fibres are \n\ncollected before the complete evaporation of the solvent, the fibres will either flatten or adhere to other fibres \n\ncausing interconnected network of fibres. Moreover, if the rate of evaporation of the solvent is too low such that \n\nthe solution has not evaporated sufficiently when the electrospinning jet reaches the collector, fibres may not \n\nbe formed at all, and a thin film of polymer solution are deposited on the collector. The evaporation rate of a \n\nsolvent is dependent on many factors: vapour pressure, boiling point, specific heat, enthalpy and heat of \n\nvaporization of the solvent, rate of heat supply, interaction between solvent molecules and between solvent and \n\nsolute molecules, surface tension of liquid, and air movement above the liquid surface.9,62 \n\n \n\nB. Processing Conditions \n\ni. Voltage \n\nA crucial element in electrospinning is the application of a high voltage (HV) to the solution. The high \n\nvoltage will induce the necessary charges on the solution and together with the external electric field, will initiate \n\nthe electrospinning process. Generally, both high negative or positive voltage of more than 6kV can cause the \n\nsolution drop at the tip of the needle. Depending on the feed rate of the solution, a higher voltage may be required \n\nso that the Taylor Cone is stable. In most cases, a higher voltage will lead a reducing in the diameter of the \n\nfibres and encourage faster solvent evaporation to yield drier fibres. The effect of high voltage is not only on \n\nthe physical appearance of the fibre, it also affects the crystallinity of the polymer. The electrostatic field may \n\ncause the polymer molecules to be more ordered during electrospinning, thus inducing a greater crystallinity in \n\nthe fibre. Another factor that may influence the diameter of the fibre is the flight time of the electrospinning jet. \n\nA longer flight time will allow more time for the fibres to stretch and elongates before it is deposited on the \n\ncollection plate. Thus, at a lower voltage, the reduced acceleration of the jet and the weaker electric field may \n\nincrease the flight time of the electrospinning jet which may favour the formation of finer fibres. Both AC and \n\nDC voltage supply can be used in electrospinning, although DC is more commonly used.62 \n\n \n\nii. Feed rate \n\nThe feed rate will determine the amount of solution available for electrospinning. For a given voltage, \n\nthere is a corresponding feed rate if a stable Taylor Cone is maintained. When the feed rate is increased, there \n\nis a corresponding increase in the fibre diameter or beads size, Figure 2.8.9  \n\n \n\niii. Effect of Collector \n\nThe collector plate is made of conductive material such as aluminium foil which is electrically grounded \n\nso that there is a stable potential difference between the source and the collector. In the case when a non-\n\nconducting material is used as a collector, charges on the electrospinning jet will quickly accumulate on the \n\ncollector which will result in fewer fibres deposited with lower packing density compared to those collected on \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\na conducting surface. For a conducting collector, charges on the fibres are dissipated thus allowing more fibres \n\nto be attracted to the collector.62  \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niv. Nozzle (needle) diameter \n\nA smaller internal diameter of the needle was found to reduce the clogging as well as the number of \n\nbeads on the electrospun fibres. The reduction in the clogging could be due to less exposure of the solution to \n\nthe atmosphere during electrospinning. Decrease in the internal diameter of the orifice causes a reduction in the \n\ndiameter of the electrospun fibres. In any case, if the diameter of the orifice is too small, it may not be possible \n\nto extrude a droplet of solution at its tip.62 \n\n \n\nv. Distance between Tip and Collector \n\nVarying the distance between the tip and the collector will have a direct influence in both the flight time \n\nand the electric field strength. Increasing collecting distance cause fibre diameter decrease as the jet will have a \n\nlonger distance to travel. It gives enough time for the solvents to evaporate before reaching the collector. When \n\nthe distance is too low, excess solvent may cause the fibres to merge where they contact to form junctions \n\nresulting in inter and intra layer bonding, Figure 2.9. This interconnected fibre mesh may provide additional \n\nstrength to the resultant scaffold.9  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 Polycaprolactone fibres with increasing beads size with increasing feed rate at A. 0.5mL/h and B. \n\n2mL/h (courtesy of Teo and Ramakrishna, National University of Singapore).62 \n\nFigure 2.9 Nylon 6,6 at a) 2 cm deposition distance and b) 0.5 cm deposition distance (adapted from Buchko et \n\nal., 1999).62 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nC. Ambient Parameters \n\ni. Humidity \n\nThe humidity of the environment determines the rate of evaporation of the solvent in the solution. There \n\nare no ideal values for humidity to improve the morphology of the fibres. However, at a very low humidity, a \n\nvolatile solvent may dry rapidly.62  \n\n \n\nii. Type of Atmosphere  \n\nDifferent gases have different behaviour under high electrostatic field. For example, helium will break \n\ndown under high electrostatic field and thus electrospinning is not possible. When gas with higher breakdown \n\nvoltage is used, the fibres obtained have twice the diameter of those electrospun in air, given all other conditions \n\nequal.62 \n\n \n\niii. Pressure \n\nGenerally, reduction in the pressure surrounding the electrospinning jet does not improve the process. \n\nWhen the pressure is below atmospheric pressure, the polymer solution in the syringe will have a greater \n\ntendency to flow out of the needle and there cause unstable jet initiation. As the pressure decreases, rapid \n\nbubbling of the solution will occur at the needle tip. At very low pressure, electrospinning is not possible due \n\nto direct discharge of the electrical charges.62  \n\n \n\n2.5.3 Properties of electrospun nanofibres   \n\nA. Porosity \n\n For a variety of applications, porous fibre surfaces are desired. In electrospun nanofibres, two types of \n\npores can be identified: pores on/within each fibre and pores between the fibres of a nanofibrous membrane.  A \n\nhigh density of pores can be formed due to the entanglement of fibres. When compared to mesoporous materials \n\n(e.g., molecular sieves), the specific surface area of the electrospun fibres is lower, but the pores are relatively \n\nlarge and fully interconnected to form a 3D network. The knowledge of pore size and porosity is essential in \n\ndetermining the membrane\u2019s performance. Pore size determines the type of substance or species that can \n\npermeate through, whereas porosity is a measure of the flow across the membrane.64,68  \n\n \n\nB. Surface structure \n\n The surface of electrospun fibres is generally smooth. The use of low concentration solution or high \n\nelectrical potential produces beaded electrospun structures that are considerably rougher than completely fibrous \n\nstructures, Figure 2.10. The cross-sectional shape of electrospun fibres is usually circular. However, in some \n\ncases, a skin forms on the polymeric jet and then collapses into a ribbon as the solvent evaporates. This results \n\nin flattened nanofibres, which are created with high molecular weight polymers and high polymer concentration. \n\nThe solvent evaporation reduces with higher solution viscosity, resulting in wet fibres that reach the collector \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\nand are flattened by the impact. The flat ribbon shape can be attributed to the collapse of an outer skin formed \n\non the surface of the jet.64  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nC. Chain conformation and crystallinity \n\n Due to rapid stretching of the electrified jet and the rapid evaporation of the solvent, the polymer chains \n\nare expected to experience an extremely strong shear force during the electrospinning process. This rapid \n\nstretching and solidification can prevent the polymer chains from relaxing back to their equilibrium \n\nconformations. As a result, more molecular orientation is found. The rapid stretching and solidification of the \n\npolymer chains lead to another important effect, the retardation of the crystallization process. The time is not \n\nenough for stretched chains to crystallize. Although the polymer chains are noncrystalline in the nanofibres, \n\nthey are highly oriented. Thus, the defects in crystallization are minimal.64 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.10 SEM images of electrospun haemoglobin in 2,2,2-Trifluoroethanol at the following concentration: (a) 150 \n\nmg/ml, (b) 175 mg/ml, (c) 200 mg/ml and (d) 225 mg/ml (courtesy of Barnes et al., Journal of Engineered Fibers \n\nand Fabrics, JEFF, 1, 16, 2006).64 \n\n\n\n \n\n49 \n\n \n\n2.6 Potential of electrospun PCL fibre mats for biomedical applications \n\n \n\nPoly (?-caprolactone), (PCL) or simply polycaprolactone is a hydrophobic semi-crystalline polymer. Its \n\nbiodegradability, biocompatibility, chemical and thermal stability, and good mechanical properties present the \n\nviability in the usage of this polyester in the emerging field of biomedical applications. 9,69 Biodegradable \n\nsynthetic polymers as PCL are widely used as scaffolds for TE. The electrospun PCL fibre mats act as temporary \n\nsubstrates for promoting adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of various types of cultured cells, carriers \n\nfor biological agents, and wound decreasing materials.6 PCL is synthetized by ring opening polymerization of \n\nthe cyclic monomer ?-caprolactone, using various anionic, cationic and co-ordination catalysts.  \n\nThe good solubility and blend compatibility of PCL has been making it useful in biomedical \n\napplications. Because PCL can be degraded in slower rate than other polymers such as polyglycolide, poly D,L-\n\nlactide and its copolymers, thus it is suitable for use in applications that require slow degradation. PCL can be \n\nblended and modified with other polymers to improve its physical, chemical, and mechanical properties. \n\nMoreover, it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans.69 In addition, PCL can be \n\nformed as continuous ultrafine fibres by electrospinning to give excellent characteristics such as high porosity \n\nand surface area.9 The degradation of PCL nanofibres has received a great deal of attention when used as an \n\nimplantable biomaterial. PCL can be degraded by hydrolysis of its ester linkages in physiological conditions \n\n(such as in the human body).69 Biodegradability of PCL is important; thus, the sub-products of degradation \n\ncould not evoke any inflammatory reaction. Depending on the molecular weight, PCL as a homopolymer has \n\ndegradation times ranging from 2 to 4 years. As a semi-crystalline material, the degradation initiates in the \n\namorphous regions. When the amorphous phases are fully degraded, it results in a highly crystalline but with \n\nlow molecular weight polymer. Water molecules will permeate further into the implant. Further degradation of \n\nthe crystalline phase is carried out by cellular activity, and will result in fragmentation and decreased mechanical \n\nproperties.41,70  \n\nThe hydrophobic nature of PCL limits protein absorption and consequently cell attachment. To improve \n\nthe hemocompatibility and endothelization of PCL nanofibres, usually the polymer surface is submitted to a \n\nchemical modification. This should enhance the subsequent immobilization of various bioactive substances.71,72 \n\nSeveral approaches have been developed to modify polymer surfaces, such as plasma modification, wet \n\nchemical method, surface graft polymerization, blending of synthetic polymers with natural ones, or physical \n\nadsorption of proteins.73,74  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \u2013 MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n3.1 Materials \n\n3.1.1 Synthesis of EAK 16?II  \n\n The solid support, Rink Amide MBHA resin LL (100?200 mesh) \n\n(4?(2\u00c6,4\u00c6?Dimethoxyphenyl?Fmoc-aminomethyl)?phenoxyacetamido norleucyl?MBHA), was provided by \n\nNovabiochem\u00ae (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany).

Solid-phase is a powerful strategy for multi-step reactions and it means that the desired molecule \n\nwill be synthesized on the surface of a solid polymeric support. It changed the strategy of peptide synthesis by \n\nallowing the isolation of the intended products out of each step and simplifying the tedious and demanding steps \n\nof purification associated with solution phase synthesis. Moreover, it permitted the development of automation \n\nand the extensive range of robotic instrumentation, saving lots of time during the procedure and dramatically \n\nimproving the yields of product. In SPPS two main strategies are used: the Boc/Bzl and the Fmoc/tBu approaches \n\nfor N-terminal/side chain protecting groups. In this work, the focus is the Fmoc strategy for SPPS. The Fmoc/tBu \n\nmethod is based upon an orthogonal protecting group strategy.75  \n\nSPPS is performed from the C-terminus to the N-terminus of the peptide (opposite to direction in nature) \n\nwith the introduction of N?-protected amino acids. In Fmoc-SPPS, the peptide chain is assembled stepwise, one \n\namino acid at a time, while attached to an insoluble resin support. Amino acids are protected at their amino \n\nterminus by the Fmoc group. Fmoc is a special protecting group which is used to protect amine functional \n\ngroups from reacting. This approach uses the base-labile Fmoc group for protection of the ?-amino function \n\nfrom the acid-labile linkers that constitute the C-terminal amino acid protecting group. This amino group acts \n\nas a linker in the amino acids coupling reactions and is responsible for the activation reaction between the first \n\namino acid and the resin. Before every coupling reaction, the amino acid needs to be Fmoc-de-protected, \n\nresulting in a free amine group available for coupling. The amino acids coupling reaction, and the consequent \n\nchain grow, occurs after activation of the carboxylic acid terminus. This procedure is repeated doing n-de-\n\nprotections and n-couplings during n-cycles until the desired sequence is complete. Once chain elaboration is \n\naccomplished, the final Fmoc should be equally removed and the N-terminus can be either left as a free amine \n\nor it can be capped with a subtle group. The peptide is then cleaved from the resin and side chain protections \n\nare removed. In this synthesis, a process of washing and filtration of the sample is performed at the end of each \n\nstep. Thus, excess of reagents, solvents, and any other compounds not bound to the resin are removed. This \n\nprocedure can prevent unwanted reactions, allowing higher yields, and producing cleaner synthesis.76 Figure \n\n3.1 summarizes the SPPS method. \n\n \n\ni. Solid support \n\n The solid support is a plastic polymer functionalized with a linker molecule. These are often referred to \n\nas resins. The resin is an insoluble and inert support. The function of the linkers is to link the peptide to the resin \n\nduring SPPS. The linker also defines the C-terminal functional groups that can be either an acidic or an amidic \n\ngroup, formed, respectively, via an ester or an amide bond. For the synthesis of C-terminal peptide amides the \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n\n \n\ncommonly used resins are Rink amide resin, Pal resin, and Sieber resin. These resins are compatible with Fmoc \n\nchemistry and final acidic cleavage. These resins are usually Fmoc-protected and should be deprotected before \n\nincorporation of the first residue.77  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nii.  Solvents \n\n Prior to beginning a synthesis, the resin should be swelled in the synthesis solvent. The most common \n\nsolvents for Fmoc-SPPS are dimethylformamide (DMF) or N-methylpyrolidone (NMP). Swelling the resins \n\nallows them to expand and maximize the exposure of their functional groups to the incoming reactants. NMP  \n\nand DMF are common used solvents. They efficiently solvate the resin and, in many cases, improves coupling \n\nFigure 3.1 Scheme of SPPS method, (adapted).77 \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\nyield. Most common peptide reagents are very soluble in NMP; however, DMF is cheaper that NMP, so it is \n\nmore frequently used even despite its tendency to release reactive amines. \n\niii. Fmoc-deprotection and Piperidine test \n\nFmoc is stable in acidic conditions but it is easily removed by a weak base. Typically, piperidine is used \n\nas the base for this de-protection reaction. The result is an unprotected or free amine which can undergo a \n\ncoupling reaction with the carbonyl of the next amino acid. Fmoc de-protection is a very critical step since it \n\ndetermines the yield and quality of reaction due to deleted residues and even capped peptides. Fmoc group \n\nremoval in SPPS proceeds through a two-step mechanism, where the unprotected amino acids, or resin, are \n\nprotonated resulting in the final product with a free -NH2 group. The first step is the removal of the acidic proton \n\nat the 9-position of the fluorene ring system by a mild base, preferably a secondary amine, like piperidine. The \n\nuse of cyclic secondary amines is more convenient due to their nucleophilicity (capacity to attack any other \n\natom than hydrogen). The second step is the subsequent ?-elimination that yields a highly reactive \n\ndibenzofulvene (DBF) intermediate which is immediately trapped by the secondary amine to form stable \n\nadducts, Figure 3.2. This step occurs with the formation of CO2. These reactions work better in an electron \n\ndonor and relative polar medium, such as DMF.78 To ensure the correct coupling of the first amino acid, a \n\npiperidine test is performed. This test is also known as resin functionalization test and is used to quantify the \n\nfunctionalization of the resin with the first amino acid. Fmoc removal can be monitored by UV spectroscopy. \n\nThe de-protection results in formation of a DBF-piperidine adduct that strongly absorbs in the UV range. This \n\nis a common procedure with automatic synthesizers. The piperidine test must result in a functionalization of, at \n\nleast, 98%. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.2 Mechanism of removal of Fmoc protecting group using piperidine, (adapted).103 \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n\n \n\niv. Carboxylic activation and coupling reagents \n\nThe activation reaction involves the binding of the carboxyl terminal of the amino acid to the solid \n\nsupport, and to the consequent amino acids. The carboxylate here is not very reactive, thus the carbonyl needs \n\nto be activated. The activation of the carboxylic group passes through making it more electrophilic. Normally, \n\nthis step is performed using the coupling reagents promoting the activation in situ. Coupling reagents activate \n\nthe carbonyl group for substitutions by converting the anionic oxygen into an acceptable leaving group. The \n\ncarboxylic activation is described as an acceleration of carbodiimide-mediated couplings, a suppression of \n\nracemization and an inhibition of dehydration of the carboxamide side chains. In other words, it is the chemical \n\nprocess responsible to remove the carboxylic group present in the amino acid nomenclature and to form an \n\namidic group, sustaining the chirality of the molecule. Activation occurs very rapidly in DMF. Excellent results \n\nhave been obtained for Fmoc-SPPS using the activating reagent HBTU combined with HOBt, in the presence \n\nof a base such as the tertiary amine DIPEA. HATU is also typically used in cases of difficult coupling reactions \n\nand its rather combined with Oxyma Pure.79  \n\n \n\nv. Kaiser test (ninhydrin test)  \n\nThe Kaiser test is a quantitative and very sensitive test where it uses ninhydrin to detect the presence or \n\nabsence of free primary amino groups. It is a widespread colorimetric assay commonly used in SPPS to monitor \n\nthe N-terminus de-protection, to determine if coupling reactions are complete, and gives the overall yield of the \n\nreaction. This test is responsible to determine the percentage of free amine groups present in the synthesis, i.e., \n\nthe amine groups that didn\u2019t react with the C-terminus of the following amino acid, resulting in short chains of \n\npeptide. Ninhydrin reacts with the de-protected N-terminal amine group of the peptide-resin. Ninhydrin is a \n\nwhite solid which is soluble in ethanol and acetone at room temperature. When reacting with free amines, a \n\ndeep blue or purple colour known as Ruhemann's purple is produced, Figure 3.3. However, when amino acids \n\nresidues are attached with their N-terminus protected, so if the next residue has been successfully coupled onto \n\nthe chain, the test gives as colourless or yellow result.80 Depending on the colour obtained the synthesis can \n\neither proceed or undergo the repetition of some previous steps. The actions followed according to the obtained \n\ncolour are described in the table 1. In the end, the yield of reaction needs to be more than 97% to assume \n\ncompletion of the coupling reaction and for the synthesis to proceed. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Actions available according to the colour results obtained from reacting ninhydrin with free amines. 81 \n\nColour Result Action \n\nColourless or faint blue  Complete coupling Proceed with synthesis \n\nDark blue, colourless beads  Nearly complete coupling Extend coupling or cap \n\nunreacted chains \n\nLight blue, dark blue beads  Incomplete coupling Recouple \n\nIntense blue, all beads are blue Failed coupling Check amino acids, reagents \n\nRecouple \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nvi. Side chain protecting groups \n\nIn the Fmoc strategy, it is important that the side chain protecting groups are not sensitive to base, so \n\nthat these groups remain on the side chains throughout all coupling steps and do not fall off during the piperidine \n\nde-protection steps. Some of the most commonly used side-chain protecting groups are Boc and OtBu. Both \n\naren\u2019t reactive with piperidine and can be removed under acidic conditions, commonly using TFA, at the final \n\ncleavage of the peptidyl-resin linkage. Both permanent and temporary protector will ensure the reaction of \n\nFmoc-amino acids, only in the site of interest for the formation of the peptide bond. It helps to prevent secondary \n\nreactions, such as the incorporation of dipeptides derivatives instead of an amino acid derivative. In addition, it \n\nmay help in the final purification of the product due to reduced number of undesired products.75  \n\n \n\nvii. Final De-protection and Cleavage \n\nAfter performing the coupling of all amino acids of the peptide sequence, the synthesis proceeds to \n\npeptide cleavage. Peptide cleavage consists in the separation of the peptide from the resin and in the removal of \n\nthe side chain protecting groups and, thus, in obtaining the desired peptide, free of any protecting groups or \n\nstructural modification. When using the orthogonal protection Fmoc/tBu strategy, the peptidyl-resin linkage and \n\nthe side chain protecting groups are removed in an acidic environment, normally using TFA. The process of \n\ndeprotection in an acid environment can, however, generate highly reactive species (e.g. carbocations). These \n\ncarbocations are very reactive electrophilic species, capable of reacting with some side chains with nucleophilic \n\ncharacteristics, causing covalent modifications of some amino acid residues. The use of nucleophilic reagents, \n\ncalled scavengers (reactive with properties like those of the species to be protected), together with TFA during \n\nFigure 3.3 Mechanism describing the reaction of ninhydrin with free amines, resulting in the formation of the \n\nRuhemann\u2019s Purple compound (adapted).80 \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n\n \n\nthe release, allows to significantly reduce unwanted side reactions. The cleavage is then performed using the \n\nso-called cleavage cocktail. The cocktail consists in a mixture of a solution composed mainly by TFA and \n\nappropriated scavengers such as water, trialkylsilanes, thiols. The choice of the release mixture, the type of \n\nscavengers and the time required by the de-protection, depend on the amino acid sequence, and on the nature \n\nand number of the protecting groups used in the side chain. Cleavage reactions typically take 0.5 to 3 hours \n\ndepending on the linkers and protecting groups used. After the cleavage reaction, the cleavage solution is filtered \n\nfrom the resin and the peptide is obtained by precipitation with ice-cold ether. Peptides should be washed at \n\nleast 3 times with ice-cold ether following precipitation to remove the scavengers as much as possible. \n\nAfterwards, peptides may be left in a hood to air-dry overnight, or lyophilized for storage.75 \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Peptide purification and chromatographic characterization  \n\nThe crude peptide obtained from stepwise SPPS will often contain a variety of by-products in addition \n\nto the desired product. These products include peptides containing deletion or addition sequences generated \n\nduring the synthesis itself and a series of peptides containing chemical modifications usually generated during \n\nthe cleavage and de-protection steps. Crude peptides of less than 30 residues can be expected to be between 80-\n\n95% target peptide, all that is required is an effective purification protocol, where the other components can be \n\nsuccessfully removed. In general, mostly of the peptides fewer than 50 residues in length can be purified using \n\nReversed Phase - High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC). RP-HPLC is the most widely used \n\nanalytical technique for the separation, identification and quantification of organic compounds in mixtures, such \n\nas biomedical samples. HPLC can be performed with or without prior clean-up steps, although time-consuming \n\nclean-up and fractioning steps are crucial to its success.82 Molecules that possess some degree of hydrophobic \n\ncharacter, such as proteins and peptides, can be separated by RP-HPLC with excellent recovery due to its high \n\nresolution. \n\n \n\ni. Components of a basic RP-HPLC \n\nA basic RP-HPLC system comprises the following components: a reservoir, a high-pressure pump, an \n\ninjector, a column, and a detector, Figure 3.4. The reservoir is responsible to hold the solvent, called the mobile \n\nphase. The motion of the solvent is generated using a high-pressure pump that also serves to determine it specific \n\nflow rate. The sample is injected into the continuously flowing mobile phase stream by the injector, carrying \n\nthe sample into the HPLC column. The column contains the chromatographic packing material needed to affect \n\nthe separation. This packing material is called the stationary phase because it is held in place by the column \n\nhardware. A detector is needed to see the separated compound bands as they elute from the HPLC column. \n\nCommonly, UV detector with fixed or variable wavelength is used for liquid chromatographic analysis. The \n\nmobile phase exits the detector and can be sent to waste, or collected, as desired.83 \n\n\n\n \n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nii. Mechanism of protein/peptide retention \n\nThe retention mechanism in reversed phase chromatography depends on the hydrophobic binding \n\ninteraction between the solute molecule in the mobile phase and the immobilized hydrophobic ligand, i.e. the \n\nstationary phase. Proteins and peptides possess some degree of hydrophobicity that allows them to be adsorbed \n\nby the stationary phase, Figure 3.5. The net interaction caused by this hydrophobic adsorption is very strong \n\nresulting in the protein remaining adsorbed to the surface. Much of the proteins are large when compared to the \n\nthickness of the hydrophobic surface. This makes them to lie above the surface and be permanently in contact \n\nwith the mobile phase. The mobile phase constitutes the organic solvent. At a specific concentration of the \n\nsolvent, proteins are desorbed from the surface and elutes from the column. The amount of organic solvent is \n\nunique to each protein. Elution can proceed either by isocratic conditions where the concentration of organic \n\nsolvent is constant, or by gradient elution whereby the amount or organic solvent is increased over time. In this \n\nlast case, a gradual increase in the concentration of organic solvent compared to water increases the \n\nhydrophobicity of the mobile phase and determines the competition between it and the stationary phase, \n\nresulting in a loss of the analyte.84 Separation is accomplished by the single adsorption/desorption process, \n\nalthough there is some interaction with the surface as the protein moves down the column. The sample should \n\nideally be dissolved in the initial mobile phase in a way to provide a reproducible and homogeneous solution. \n\nThis solution must be relatively free of interferences to do not cause any damage in the column and be prepared \n\naccordingly to the solvent system that will be employed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 Components of HPCL system, adapted from Waters. \n\n\n\n \n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\niii. Column characteristics \n\nThe column is selected depending on the nature of the solute and the information about the analyte.  \n\nProteins and peptides are separated by interacting with the hydrophobic surface of particles packed in columns. \n\nThe particles in the column are usually made of silica because silica is physically robust, it is stable under most \n\nsolvent conditions (except at pH greater than 6.5), and can be made into spherical particles of various sizes with \n\npores of different diameters. The silica is modified with a hydrocarbon molecule to create a hydrophobic surface. \n\nA C8 or C18 column made from specially purified, less acidic silica, and designed specifically for the separation \n\nof basic compounds is generally suitable for all samples and is strongly recommended. Columns with 5 ?m \n\nparticle size give the best compromise of efficiency, reproducibility, and reliability. Using small pore diameter \n\n(~100 \u00c5) silica results in inferior proteins separations. Wide pore silica diameter (~300 \u00c5) gives much better \n\nseparation of proteins. The interaction between column and proteins/peptides occurs near the top of the column, \n\nthus, columns length is not important in protein separations.85 \n\n \n\niv. Mobile phase \n\nThe mobile phase usually contains strong acids at low pH with large concentrations of organic solvent. \n\nThe most popular organic modifier employed for separating peptides is acetonitrile. This solvent is essentially \n\nUV transparent. Most peptides only absorb at low wavelengths in the UV spectrum (typically less than 225 nm), \n\nand acetonitrile provides much lower background absorbance that other common solvents at low wavelengths. \n\nAcetonitrile is also used because it is volatile and it can be easily removed from the sample. The RP \n\nchromatography of proteins and peptides requires a reagent, called an \u201cion-pair\u201d, added to the mobile phase \n\nintended to achieve good peak shape. It is believed that metal impurities on the silica surface are responsible for \n\npoor protein/peptide peak shape in the absence if an ion-pair reagent. The most commonly used ion-pair reagent \n\nis TFA. The TFA concentration may affect peptide selectivity. TFA added to the mobile phase at a concentration \n\nof ~0.1% results in good peak shape on most columns.85 \n\nFigure 3.5 Hydrophobic interactions and protein adsorption inside the column in RP-HPLC.84 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n61 \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Plasma polymer deposition through Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jet (APPJ) \n\nSpecialists define plasma as \u201cpartially or completely ionized gas that comprises free electrons, ions, \n\nradicals and atoms or molecules of non-ionized neutral gas\u201d. Plasma deposition, also known as plasma \n\nactivation or plasma functionalization, is a method employed for modifying or coating surfaces, aiming to \n\nimprove the adhesion properties of the material. Plasma deposition has applications for the modification of \n\nsurfaces, depositions of thin films, sterilization, or surface modification of polymer fibres, with utility in the \n\nbiomedical, environmental, and technological fields. The goal of surface functionalization is to deposit chemical \n\nfunctionalities, independently of the substrate, to promote linkage with other substances added in a second \n\nmoment, such as biomolecules. Amongst the several plasma modification techniques, Atmospheric Pressure \n\nPlasmas (APPs) are one of the most preferred techniques. APP treatments do not require complex and expensive \n\nvacuum systems and have shorter processing time.  \n\nThe working principle of APPJ is based on the ionization of a gas through an electrical discharge. The \n\npresent work used the method and device described in the patent U.S. Pat. No. 2016/0295676 by Patelli et al., \n\nfor generating plasma at atmospheric-pressure and under low-temperatures conditions. Low-pressure and low-\n\ntemperature plasmas benefit the process of surface coating because they generate high concentrations of reactive \n\nspecies that can etch, and deposit thin films, and the thermally sensitive substrates are not damaged. This device \n\nis intended for treating surfaces and for deposition of surface coating by means of the introduction of a precursor \n\nin a channel situated inside and coaxial with respect to the duct with the plasma. This device comprises: a first \n\npair of electrodes, each of which separated by a dielectric layer, arranged in a way that connects to a High-\n\nFrequency (HF) power supply, and externally positioned with respect to a tubular duct where the gas flows; a \n\nsecond pair of electrodes equally separated by a dielectric layer, arranged to connect with a Radio-Frequency \n\n(RF) power supply and with respect to said tubular duct where the same gas flows downstream with respect to \n\nthe first pair and the direction of the flow. A HF excitation is applied to the first pair of electrodes. RF excitation \n\nis applied to the second pair of electrodes. The coupling of a HF power supply with RF power supply, and the \n\npossibility to operate with pulse trains is designed to obtain cold and self-sustained plasma in a wide range of \n\nwork conditions and mixtures. The filamentary plasma generated in this manner emerges from the gas flow at \n\nthe outlet of the transport duct, Figure 3.6. Filamentary plasma is a result of an applied electric field that is \n\ngreater than the strike voltage, to the gas. This produces electrons\u2019 acceleration, causing avalanche ionization \n\nalong the direction of the electric field itself, forming a filament that then dies out. Helium, hydrogen, neon, \n\nnitrogen, argon, oxygen or mixtures thereof can be used as operating gas in any ratio, resulting in a wide array \n\nof chemically active species in the plasma. These species can be either organic, inorganic, nano-composites, \n\namong others. Chemical precursors and reagents can be added to the plasma as vapours or aerosols.86  \n\n\n\n \n\n62 \n\n \n\n  \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.4 Chemo-selective ligation \n\n Chemo-selective ligation is a term employed to describe a site-specific modification to facilitate the \n\nassembly of biomolecules. Often presented as chemical bio-conjugation, or simply bio-conjugation, chemo-\n\nselective ligation is the process of linking or connecting a biological molecule with another moiety under mild \n\naqueous conditions. These moieties may include other biomolecules, synthetic polymers, and small molecules \n\nsuch as ligands, drugs, or fluorescent dyes, among others.  \n\nBio-conjugation can happen through multiple chemical reactions. The choice of method of conjugation \n\ndepends on the native functional groups presented in the target biomolecules. These groups are the primary sites \n\nfor bio-conjugation and are generally nucleophiles or electrophiles. The most typical methods in chemo-\n\nselective ligation are the reaction of an amino group with activated carboxylic acids, isothiocynates, and \n\ncarbonyls, such as ketones or aldehydes, although aldehydes are substantially more reactive than ketones, \n\nfollowed by in situ reductive amination.87,88 Primary amines groups (R-NH2) are one of the most common \n\nnucleophiles in biomolecules, and represent an ubiquitous key functional group found in many biological \n\nsystems, such as in free amino acids. The reaction between an amine and a carbonyl is highly chemo-selective \n\nand is compatible with other functional groups present in biomolecules. Primary amines will spontaneously \n\nreact with aldehydes and ketones to form imines, also known as Schiff bases, Figure 3.7 a). The resulting imine \n\nbond is covalent but reversible, and both its stability and dynamics strongly depend on the nature of the amine \n\nand the carbonyl. To address this shortcoming, reductive amination is usually carried out either as one-pot or \n\ntwo-step reaction with sodium cyano-borohydride, yielding a stable secondary amine, Figure 3.7 b).89 \n\nFigure 3.6 On the left, components and APPJ system; on the right, APPJ equipment with a filamentary jet.86 \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3 Methods of analysis \n\n3.3.1 Contact angle \n\nContact angle is employed to determine the wettability of a surface. The contact angle is defined as the \n\nangle formed in the point where solid, liquid, and vapour co-exist, also referred as the \u201cthree-phase contact \n\nline\u201d. The contact angle is geometrically acquired by applying a tangent line from the contact point along the \n\nliquid-vapour interface in the droplet profile. The angle, ?, between the surface and the static drop deposited \n\nindicates the wettability of the sample. Small contact angles (\u00ab 90\u00ba) correspond to high wettability, while large \n\ncontact angles (\u00bb 90\u00ba) correspond to low wettability, Figure 3.8. Specifically, a contact angle less than 90\u00ba \n\nindicates that wetting of the surface is favourable, and the fluid will spread over a large area on the surface; \n\nwhile contact angle greater than 90\u00ba generally means that wetting of the surface is unfavourable so the fluid will \n\nminimize its contact with the surface and form a compact liquid droplet. Complete wetting occurs when the \n\ncontact angle is 0\u00ba.90 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 a) Primary amine reacting with aldehyde to for an imine; b) Reductive amination with NaBH3CN, yielding a \n\nsecondary amine, (adapted).89 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 From left to right, contact angles indicating high wettability (?<<90\u00ba), low wettability (?=90\u00ba), and \n\nunfavourable wettability.90 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen \n\n The Kjeldahl method was developed by Johann Kjeldahl in 1883, and is usually considered to be the \n\nstandard method to determine protein concentration. The method is based on a preliminary transformation of \n\nall the compounds of total nitrogen, organic and inorganic, to nitrate by digestion of an alkaline with a strong \n\nacid. Upon digestion, nitrogen is released and can be determined by a suitable titration technique. The total \n\nnitrogen in the sample is liberated at high temperature. UV-visible spectrophotometry constitutes one of the \n\nseveral techniques that can be used to measure the total nitrogen using Kjeldahl method. First, a calibration \n\ncurve of absorbance versus nitrate concentration is prepared using a series of nitrate solutions of known \n\nconcentration. The absorbance of the solution being analysed is then measured at the same wavelength, and its \n\nnitrate concentration determined from the calibration curve.91  \n\n \n\n3.3.3 Cell viability assay: MTT test \n\n3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, is a yellow water-soluble tetrazolium \n\nsalt, commonly represented by MTT. MTT assay is a colorimetric cell viability test, mainly used for \n\nspectrophotometric assessment of the metabolic activities of microorganisms, due to the colour yielded upon its \n\nenzymatic reduction. The yellow tetrazolium MTT is metabolically reduced by active cells, in part by the action \n\nof dehydrogenase enzyme, to yield a water-insoluble purple formazan crystal, which can be solubilized and \n\nquantified spectrophotometrically. The total amount of formazan produced is directly proportional to the \n\nnumber of viable cells in the culture; thus, the MTT assay represents a standard method for the indirect \n\nestimation of cell\u2019s viability. MTT dye is light sensitive; thus, the assays are usually done in the dark. MTT is \n\ncurrently the most employed method to assess cell proliferation; however, tetrazolium dye assays can also be \n\nused to measure cytotoxicity (loss of viable cells) or cytostatic activity (shift from proliferation to quiescence) \n\nof potential medicinal agents and toxic materials. The reason for its usage relies in its advantage to be performed \n\nusing microplates and automated reading, significantly improving the test in terms of time and cost.92,93 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n65 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 4 \u2013 EXPERIMENTAL PART \n\n \n\n4.1 Peptide Synthesis and Characterization \n\n4.1.1 Synthesis of EAK 16-II \n\n The synthesis of EAK 16?II, amide terminal \n\n(H?Ala?Glu?Ala?Glu?Ala?Lys?Ala?Lys?Ala?Glu?Ala?Glu?Ala?Lys?Ala?Lys?NH2), followed standard \n\nFmoc chemistry SPPS method. The synthesis used Syro I synthesizer (MultiSynTech GmbH, Witten, Germany) \n\nwith reaction mixing by vigorous vortex, performed in two reactors. The Syro I used fully automated \n\nHBTU/HOBt in situ cycles, in DMF. \n\n For each reactor, the synthesis was carried out on 0.36 mmol g?1 (resin load) of Rink Amide MBHA \n\nresin. The synthesis scale was 0.125 mmol, given by the product between the resin load and the resin amount \n\n(347.2 mg). It is always used an excess of 10% in the resin amount calculated by the synthesizer. The resin was \n\nswallowed in DMF for 15 min. The quantities of the condensation reaction and every performed step are \n\nintrinsic to the synthesis and depend on the protocol followed. The overall volume (in mL) was displayed by \n\nthe calculation protocol given by the synthesizer, and all the solutions were prepared in excess. The loading of \n\nthe first amino acid (Lys) was carried out with double coupling. The following insertions were carried out with \n\nsingle couplings, and with double couplings from the 6th cycle till the end of the synthesis. The calculation \n\nprotocol estimated a synthesis time of 1 day, 13 hours and 29 minutes. \n\n \n\nAt each cycle, the ?-amino function of the growing peptide suffered a reaction of Fmoc-de-protection, \n\nwhich comprises a three-step procedure: \n\n1. Reaction with 1mL of a solution of 40% (V/V) of piperidine in DMF for 3 minutes; \n\n2. Reaction with 1.8 mL of a solution of 20% (V/V) of piperidine in DMF for 12 minutes; \n\n3. 6 washing steps, for reaction, with DMF, emptying the reactor of the liquid phase.   \n\nThe resin is the first compound to be Fmoc-de-protected and is followed a piperidine test to evaluate \n\nthe resin loading. The piperidine test was performed by taking a sample of the functionalized resin with a weight \n\nin the range of 4?8 mg. The sample was washed several times with methanol and left to dry under vacuum for \n\n1 hour. Once dried, the sample was carefully weighted (must fit in the same range), and treated with 0.5 mL \n\nsolution of 20% piperidine in DMF. The solution was left in contact with the resin for 15 minutes by shaking it \n\nmanually. The deprotection of the amine group bound to the solid support generates the DBF intermediate which \n\nabsorbs at a wavelength (?) of 301 nm. The mixture is brought to a final volume (V) of 50 mL with DMF, and \n\nthe absorbance at ?=301 nm is measured using the double-beam spectrophotometer UV/Vis Lambda 2, Perkin \n\nElmer (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). Absorption values measured at absorbance maxima can be used, in \n\n\n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\ncombination with the respective molar absorption coefficient (?=7800 M?1cm?1), to calculate the load of resins \n\nand amino acids, Equation 1: \n\n????????? =\n(?301\u00d7?)\n\n?\u00d7??\n,             (Eq. 1) \n\n \n\nwhere loadresin is expressed in mmol g\n?1 and it represent how many moles (mmoles) of reactive sites (for \n\ncoupling) are present in 1 g of resin. A301 is the absorbance at 301 nm, V is the volume of the solution in [mL], \n\n? is the molar absorptivity in [M?1cm?1], and wt is the weight of the sample after dried in [g]. Eq. 1 gives the \n\nresult for an experimental resin load. The yield of loading is given by Equation 2: \n\n \n\n? (%) =\n???????????? ???????\n\n??????????? ???????\n\u00d7 100,         (Eq. 2) \n\n \n\nThe activation of the carboxylic group was carried out using coupling reagents HBTU/HOBt/DMF. \n\nHBTU is the condensing reagent and HOBt is the coupling reagent that activates the carboxylic group. This \n\nactivation uses a two-step procedure: \n\n1. 45 minutes reaction of resin-peptidyl in the reactor with a mixture of: \n\n- 5 equivalents (in solution) of ?-protected amino acids in DMF (1 mL of a 0.62 M solution); \n\n- 1.4 mL solution of 0.45 M HBTU/HOBt/DMF; \n\n- 10 equivalents (in solution) of DIPEA/NMP (0.625 mL of a 2 M). \n\n2. 5 washing steps for reaction with DMF. \n\nIn a first attempt, the resin load resulted in 86%. Although this shortcoming conditioned the success of \n\nthe remaining synthesis, it is a typical problem found when synthesizing self-assembling peptides. This can be \n\ncontrolled substituting the coupling reagents and performing more than one coupling per amino acid. The \n\ncoupling reagents HBTU/HOBt were substituted by HATU/Oxima pure in the same proportions.  \n\n \n\nTo determine the presence of free amino groups, and consequently the yield of the reaction, a Kaiser \n\ntest is performed, usually at the end of all coupling reactions. The procedure for this test constituted in the \n\nfollowing steps: take a sample of resin in the range of 2?8 mg, which was firstly washed 3 times with methanol \n\nand then, 2?3 drops of acetic acid was added (to avoid eventual Fmoc-removal). The sample was dried under \n\nvacuum for 1 hour and weighted again. Prepare Monitor 1, Monitor 2, and Monitor 3. \n\n- Monitor 1 (solution of 76% (w/w) of Phenol/Ethanol); \n\n- Monitor 2 (solution of 0.2 mM of KCN/Pyridine); \n\n- Monitor 3 (solution of 0.28 M of Ninhydrin/Ethanol). \n\nIn the tube containing the resin was orderly added 75 ?L of Monitor 1, 100 ?L of Monitor 2, and 75 ?L \n\nof Monitor 3. In another tube, was prepared for reference the same solution excluding the resin. Both mixtures \n\nwere heated at 100\u00baC for 5 minutes and added to a 4.8 mL of a solution of methanol at 60%. After centrifugation, \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\nthe absorbance of the liquid phase was measured at 570 nm (?=15000 M?1cm?1). The quantity of free amino \n\nfunction is calculated using Equation 3: \n\n \n\n?mol/g of aminic groups =\n(?\u00d7?\u00d710?6)\n\n?\u00d7?\n,          (Eq. 3) \n\n \n\nwhere, A is the difference between the value of absorbance of the sample and the value of absorbance of the \n\nreference solution a 570 nm; V is the volume of the sample expressed in [mL]; and P is the weight of the sample \n\nin [mg]. \n\nThe yield of the coupling reactions is given by Equation 4: \n\n \n\n? (%) = {1 ? [\n?mol/g of aminic groups\n\n?????????\u00d710\n?3\n\n]} \u00d7 100,       (Eq. 4) \n\n  \n\n The peptide cleavage from the resin and the removal of the side chain protecting groups was done under \n\nacidic conditions, using TFA as the strong acid, and TES as scavenger to avoid undesired secondary reactions. \n\nThe procedure included the following six steps: \n\n1. Once the synthesis was accomplished, the N-terminal function of the Fmoc-protecting group was \n\nautomatically removed treating the resin-peptidyl with a solution of 20% piperidine in DMF for 20 min; \n\n2. The resin-peptidyl without the Fmoc group was washed with DCM, and dried under vacuum for 2 \n\nhours; \n\n3. The resin-peptidyl was transferred to a flask and treated with a solution of 95% TFA, 2.5% H2O \n\nmilliQ, and 2.5% TES (v/v/v); \n\n4. The mixture was kept under magnetic stir at room temperature, for 1 hour and 30 minutes; \n\n5. The resin was separated by filtration with gooch G3, and the solution containing the peptide was \n\ntransported to a rotary evaporator; \n\n6. Once added cold diethyl ether (~4\u00baC), the peptide precipitated, and was filtrated with a gooch G4, \n\ndried, dissolved in H2O MilliQ, frozen, and lyophilized using Labconco FreeZone\n\u00ae 2.5 (Terra Universal, Inc, \n\nFullerton, CA). \n\n \n\n4.1.2 Characterization of EAK 16?II   \n\nPeptide purification was conducted using semi-preparative (SP) RP?HPLC. SP uses the same principle \n\nof protein/peptide retention as the one described in section 3.2.2. \n\nThe total amount of crude peptide (144.36 mg) was divided in four parts: SP1=35 mg, SP2=35 mg, \n\nSP3=34.7 mg, and SP4=39.6 mg. For each quantity, the peptide (mg) was dissolved in around the same quantity \n\nof Eluent A (mL). Magnetic stirrer and ultrasonic bath were used to complete the dissolution for around 5 \n\nminutes, each. The solution was filtered. SP was carried out using NovaPack\u00ae HR C18 Column (6 ?m, 60 \u00c5, \n\n\n\n \n\n68 \n\n \n\n7.8x300 mm), Waters 600 E System Controller, and Waters 2487 Dual ? Absorbance Detector at ?=214 nm, all \n\nprovided by Waters (Milford, Massachusetts, USA). The machine was set for a 4 mL min?1 flow, with a gradient \n\nfrom 7 to 17% of Eluent B in A for 40 minutes. The results were carefully analysed, and the best fractions were \n\nselected for HPLC, Figure 4.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWere selected fractions 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 25, 26, 27, and 28, from SP1. From each selected \n\nfraction, samples of, no more than, 150 \u00b5L\u00b110% were collected and analysed using Jupiter C18 Column (5 ?m, \n\n300 \u00c5, 250x10 mm), from Phenomenex\u00ae (Torrance, California, USA), HPLC Waters 600 E System Controller \n\nfor chromatographic analysis, Waters 2487 Dual ? Absorbance Detector at ?=214 nm, and the Empower \n\nsoftware for acquisition and integration, all provided by Waters. The machine was set for a 1 mL min?1 flow, \n\nwith a gradient from 7 to 27% of Eluent B in A for 20 minutes, with initial method using partial loop. Figure \n\n4.2 shows the resultant chromatogram for fraction 13. It is verified a large peak at retention time (RT) of 11.238 \n\nmin with a purity of ~87%. A second small peak is verified with less purity percentage (~12.93%) which refers \n\nto the presence of some impurities in this fraction, since it was absorbed at a lower absorbance (AU, \n\nadimensional unit). \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 Chromatogram for SP1.

The synthesis used Syro I synthesizer with reaction mixing by vigorous vortex. The Syro I used fully \n\nautomated HBTU/HOBt in situ cycles, in DMF. \n\n The synthesis was carried out on 0.18 mmol g?1 (resin load) of H?Phe?H NovaSyn\u00ae TG resin. The \n\nsynthesis scale was 0.094 mmol, given by the product between the resin load and the resin amount (500 mg). It \n\nis always used an excess of 10% in the resin amount calculated by the synthesizer. The resin was swallowed in \n\nDMF for 15 min.  \n\nHVP?CHO synthesis used the same protocol for Fmoc-de-protection, carboxylic activation, ninhydrin \n\ntest, and peptide cleavage and side chain protecting groups removal, as the one described in the section 4.1.1. \n\nThis synthesis doesn\u2019t require a test to evaluate the load of the resin (piperidine test), because the first amino \n\nacid in the sequence (Phe) comes with the resin. The 7-aminoheptanoic acids act as a spacer for the molecule. \n\nThe loading of the first amino acid was carried out with double coupling. The following insertions were carried \n\nout with single couplings, and with double couplings from the 5th cycle till the end of the synthesis. The \n\ncalculation protocol estimated a synthesis time of 22 hours and 1 minute.  \n\n  \n\n4.1.4 Characterization of HVP?CHO \n\nHVP?CHO is a peptide which usually yields high levels of purity even before fractioning. Before SP, \n\nthe crude peptide (4.68 mg) was analysed with RP-HPLC given a purity of ~85%, Figure 4.4. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5. % Area giving the purity of \n\nHVP before SP. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n To avoid loss of material, it wasn\u2019t conducted any fractioning of this molecule, since it is not needed \n\nfor the level of purity obtained. Crude peptide was lyophilized resulting in a final quantity of 3.98 mg of pure \n\npeptide. Molecular weight was confirmed using mass analysis, resulting in an experimental value of 1472.69 \n\nDa, relatively close to the theoretical value of 1507.76 Da. \n\n RT % Area \n\n1 12.331 84.84 \n\n2 19.064 15.16 \n\nFigure 4.4 HPLC chromatogram resultant from crude HVP peptide. \n\n\n\n \n\n71 \n\n \n\n4.2 PCL matrices production \n\nThe electrospinning apparatus was composed by a syringe of 2.5 mL, a 27G needle from Terumo \n\n(Tokyo, Japan) assembled on the syringe, a volumetric pump from New Era Pimp Systems Inc. (Farmingdale, \n\nNew York, USA) on which the syringe was set up, a high voltage generator from Gamma High Voltage \n\n(Ormond Beach, Florida, USA), a rectangular collector (8 cm x 8 cm) wrapped with an aluminium foil to \n\nfacilitate the removal, an air tube collected to a barometer, and a HD 2301.0 Thermohygrometer from Delta \n\nOhm (Caselle di Selvazzano, Padua, Italy). \n\nSpherules of PCL were dissolved in HFIP at different concentrations, to obtain different viscosities. \n\nInitially, few experiments were conducted dissolving PCL spherules in DCM (cheaper solvent); however, \n\nweren\u2019t formed any fibres, resulting only in beads deposition. This fact can be explained with the resultant low \n\nviscosity of the solution. Processing parameters were tuned to obtain submicro- and nano-fibres of PCL at very \n\nlow flow rate. Air was used as shell flow, providing more energy to the jet and helping the solvent to evaporate \n\nearlier.  \n\nThe samples were divided in two batches. The first batch includes the experiments in which the \n\nprocessing and solution parameters were based in the ones used by Zavattin, D. et. al., that has obtained \n\nsuccessful results in producing fibres in the range of micro- and nano-dimensions.94 Table 6 shows the \n\nparameters that were varied: polymer concentration of 25% and 30% PCL in HFIP (w/v) and presence/absence \n\nof air flow, labelled respectively as A (air) and NA (no air). Temperature and relative humidity (RH) are two \n\ndifficult parameters to control, depending on several local and environment conditions. The variety presented \n\nin Table 6 for these two parameters are explained with the difficulty in stabilizing them. For all cases studied, \n\nthe collector was located at 22 cm from the syringe, was applied a voltage of 20 kV to the fluid with a flow rate \n\nof 0.2 mL h?1. \n\n \n\nTable 6.

APTES is an aminosilane frequently used in the process of silanization, the functionalization of surfaces \n\nwith organofunctional alkoxysilane molecules. Surface amine groups on APTES thin films promote physical \n\nadsorption increasing affinity between silicon substrates and biomolecules. Through the addition of APTES, \n\nreactive hydroxyl groups were converted into amino-terminal groups. APTES functionalization can be done \n\nwith plasma treatment technique. The use of this kind of functionalization in PCL hydrophobic matrices, \n\nenhance the hydrophilicity of the fibre mats. Hence, it allows the interactions between the mat and the \n\nsurrounding environment.72 The amine functionality of APTES has been used to immobilize polymers and \n\nproteins, as well as to promote cell adhesion.95 \n\nAPPJ was conducted by tuning several working parameters to obtain different concentrations of the \n\nchemical precursor APTES, and, hence, different concentration of amino groups deposited in the substrates. \n\nThe working parameters presented in Table 8 were based in the studies done by Maffei, A. et. Al., in which they \n\nhave varied high voltage, radio-frequency, impulse, distance, different atmospheres for cooling (air and N2), \n\nFigure 4.5 APTES structure (adapted from Sigma-Aldrich). \n\n\n\n \n\n73 \n\n \n\nand the number of scans done for one sample at a time. They have performed five different functionalizations.  \n\nThe values were selected according to the results obtained for each silanization, such as the film thickness and \n\nthe concentration of atoms of nitrogen (N) present after deposition that had influenced the chemo-selective \n\nligation with bioactive molecules. In this case, Argon (Ar) was the gas selected as plasma gas, and as carrier for \n\nAPTES molecules. The inclusion of the chemical precursor implies the passage of Ar gas through a bubbler at \n\nroom temperature. An atmosphere of nitrogen (N2) was created to control both: the cooling of the RF electrode \n\nand the atmosphere close to the plasma jet. The substrates were fixed, one at a time, on a planar platform that \n\nmoved simultaneously along X and Y axes with controlled velocity of 300 mm s?1. This allows the torch to scan \n\nall the sample area. Samples were cut in square forms of (2 x 2 \u00b1 0.05 cm2) and located at 2 mm from the torch. \n\nEvery sample was scanned 40 times (~3 minutes). Was applied a high voltage of 9.6 kV peak to peak, the radio-\n\nfrequency varied from 12 to 20 W, with a pulsed jet of 50% d.c. (duty cycle) [hz], or continuous plasma jet.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 8 Working parameters used for silanization of surfaces with APTES by APPJ.  \n\nSample  \n\n[2x2 cm2] \n\nHV  \n\n[9.6 kV p.p] \n\nRF \n\n[W] \n\nImpulse \n\n50% d.c. \n\n[hz] \n\nAr flow \n\n[L min?1] \n\nAr \n\nbubbler \n\n[L min?1] \n\nDist. \n\n[mm] \n\nCool flow \n\n[L min?1] \n\nStage \n\nVelocity \n\n[mm s?1] \n\nN\u00ba of \n\nScans \n\nPCL_01 50 12 None 4.5 2.5 2 5 N2 300 40 \n\nPCL_03  50 20 1000 4.5 2.5 2 5 N2 300 40 \n\nPCL_04 50 15 None 4.5 2.5 2 5 N2 300 40 \n\n \n\n4.4 Contact angle measurements \n\n The surface wettability was traced by measuring the static water contact angle, after ~72 hours of \n\ntreatment. An OCA30 instrument (DataPhysics Instruments GmbH, Filderstadt, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, \n\nGermany), equipped with a CCD camera for the dropshape analysis, was at 25\u00baC and 65% of relative humidity. \n\nThe electrospun layers were fixed on glass coverslips by double-sided tape. 2 ?L of ultra-pure water were \n\napplied on different areas of the surface. The static contact angles were then measured on both sides of the two-\n\ndimensional projection of the droplet by digital image analysis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\nThe morphology of electrospun PCL fibres was examined using an environmental Scanning Electron \n\nMicroscope (SEM) (Zeiss EVO 50, Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany), with an electron accelerating \n\nvoltage of 20 kV, without coating the samples. Was used a SEM with low vacuum to prevent charging of the \n\nsamples. The average fibre diameter of the electrospun fibres was measured by ImageJ 1.52a software (National \n\nInstitute of Health, USA) from the SEM pictures in original magnification.  \n\n\n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\n4.6 Selective immobilization of HVP on the silanized matrices   \n\n The synthesis of HVP using a polymeric support with a Phe amino acid incorporated gives an aldehyde \n\ngroup in the resultant molecule free for ligation, marked in red in Figure 4.6.  \n\n \n\nThis allows the biochemical conjugation, described in section 3.2.4, between the amino groups present \n\nin the surface, obtained from the previous surface treatment, with the aldehyde group. This is a specific \n\nfunctionalization since the peptide bond is exploited only by the aldehyde group, supporting an ordered \n\ndeposition of the biomolecule on the surface. The spacer included in the HVP sequence during the synthesis \n\ngives a degree of freedom to the molecule, so it can have flexibility to move and perform it functions, Figure \n\n4.7. \n\n \n\n \n\nFor the bio-functionalization of the silanized surfaces were cut PCL layers in circles with diameter of \n\n~6.4 mm. Were cut three samples for each treatment to perform bio-conjugation with HVP peptide, labeled \n\nPCL_01_F, PCL_03_F, and PCL_04_F, three samples for each treatment without bio-functionalization for \n\ncomparison, labelled PCL_01, PCL_02, and PCL_03, and 3 samples without any surface modification. The \n\nsamples were distributed in the wells of a treated tissue culture plate of 96 wells (well diameter 6.4 mm, well \n\nvolume 360 ?L, well working volume 75?200 ?L) provided by Sigma-Aldrich (Corning\u00ae, Turin, Italy). Was \n\nprepared a buffer solution of sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate (NaH2PO4.H20) with a concentration \n\nof 20 mM, and sodium chloride (NaCl) with a concentration of 200 mM, in H2O milliQ. This solution was \n\nstabilized at pH 7.5, measured with sensiON \u2013 pH3 provided by Hach\u00ae (Lange, Milano Linate, Italy). The \n\nreductive agent sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) was added to the buffer solution in a concentration of 3 \n\nmg mL?1. The resultant solution was filtered with a filter of polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF). The peptide was \n\nFigure 4.6 HVP molecule, on the right is the polymeric support with a Phe amino acid incorporated.  \n\nFigure 4.7 In situ bio-functionalization of the matrices. \n\n\n\n \n\n75 \n\n \n\ndissolved in this solution at a concentration of 1 mg mL?1. The solution was placed in every well prepared for \n\nbio-functionalization 100 ?L of this solution. It was left to react with the silanized surface overnight, and \n\nremoved after 24 hours. Then, the surfaces were rinsed three times with H2O milliQ, and dried at room \n\ntemperature.   \n\n \n\n4.7 Surface chemistry analysis \n\nSurface chemistry was analysed by measuring the total nitrogen with the method described in the section \n\n3.3.5. This method permits the measurement of total N in the range of 0.1-0.7 mg/L. PCL silanized and bio-\n\nfunctionalized samples were weighted and dissolved in 100 ?L of HFIP. This solution was brought to a volume \n\nof 50 mL with milliQ H2O. Was added 7 mL of oxidant solution Antimony potassium tartrate \n\n(KOOC(CHOH)2COOSbO), and 0.3 g of Potassium Persulfate (K2S2O8) to 50 mL sample solution. The same \n\nquantities of potassium tartrate and potassium persulfate were added to 50 mL of bare deionized water for \n\nreference. The samples were heated at 120 \u00baC for 30 minutes, and the cooling was done at room temperature. \n\nThe analysis was conducted after withdrawal of 10 mL of digested sample and acidification with 0.15 mL of \n\nsulfuric acid (H2SO4). The digestion is strongly alkaline at the outset, which promotes oxidation of nitrogen to \n\nnitrate. Absorbance was detected at ?=200 nm, retrieving the total nitrogen concentration through a calibration \n\ncurve. \n\n \n\n4.8 Biological assays \n\n In this section is described the procedure to test the viability of the multi-layer scaffold to incorporate \n\ncells and allow them to perform their functions of proliferation and migration within. First, the scaffold was \n\nassembled with a 3D gradient obtained from the combination of bio-functionalized electrospun fibre mats with \n\nhydrogel from self-assembling peptides. This first trial was important to perceive the limitations of both systems \n\nwhen combined. In the hydrogel was incorporated the growth factor human recombinant Fibroblast Growth \n\nFactor (rh?FGF), and the inflammatory cytokine, Interleukin-6 (IL?6). In a second approach, the scaffold was \n\n\u2018disassembled\u2019 aiming to study each component separately and where was possible to evaluate the cell adhesion \n\non the bio-functionalized surfaces. The biological assay comprises the cell culture and the cell seeding.  \n\n \n\n4.8.1 Cell culture \n\nWe opted for a culture using primary cells instead of a cell line. Primary cells are not immortalized cells \n\n(cancer like phenotype) and are believed to be better for this type of experiments since measurement of \n\nreplication is like normal cells. \n\nHuman bone cells were obtained from explants of cortical mandible bone collected by surgery. The \n\npatient was a 37 years old, healthy man. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and informed \n\n\n\n \n\n76 \n\n \n\nconsent was obtained from the patient. Bone fragments were initially cultured in D-MEM/F12 (1:1) \n\nsupplemented with 20% v/v fetal bovine serum, 1% v/v sodium pyruvate, 1% v/v nonessential amino acids, 1% \n\nv/v antibiotic-antimycotic solution, and 1 U/mL insulin, until cells migrated from tissue. At confluence, cells \n\nwere detached by trypsin-EDTA and cultured in complete medium supplemented with 50 ?g mL?1 ascorbic \n\nacid, 10 nM dexamethasone, and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate. For the separation using trypsin, the residual \n\nculture media containing a trypsin inhibitor needs to be firstly removed. The cells were washed with 0.1 % v/v \n\nof Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS), and trypsin was added, centrifuging the cells with 1600 rpm for 6 minutes. \n\n \n\n4.8.2 Cell adhesion \n\nTo evaluate cell adhesion to the bio-functionalized layers of PCL, we use the tissue culture plate referred \n\nin the section 4.7. The samples of electrospun layers were sterilized in 20% (v/v) ethanol for 10 minutes, \n\nincluding the layers for control. After sterilization, samples were washed in PBS for 5 minutes. Was seeded a \n\nsolution of 100 ?L, containing ~1\u00d7104 cells of human h-osteoblasts per well, for an incubation time of 2 hours, \n\nat 37 \u00baC. At the end of the incubation, culture medium was discharged, and non-adherent cells were removed \n\nby extensive washes in PBS, and cellular viability was assessed by using the MTT assay already described \n\nherein. Samples were then incubated for 4 hours at 37 \u00baC with 100 ?L of fresh complete medium containing \n\nMTT (5 mg/mL). The reaction was stopped by adding a 10% w/v sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) solution \n\nacidified with 0.01 M HCl, and samples were stirred for 12 hours. To quantify the number of cells, a standard \n\ncurve was obtained for each experiment by culturing a known number of h-osteoblasts in complete medium. At \n\nthe end, cellular lysate (100 ?L) were transferred to a new 96-well tissue culture plate to determine the \n\nabsorbance at ?=620 nm, using a microplate reader (Sunrise, Tecan, Milan, Italy). \n\n \n\n \n\n4.8.3 Scaffold assembly and cell seeding \n\nScaffold assembly proceed with manual bottom-up layer-by-layer building stack. Two scaffolds were \n\nprepared: one where the PCL layers were conveniently functionalized, and one for control, where the layers \n\nwere only submitted to plasma treatment. PCL layers were first sterilized with an exposition to UV radiation \n\nfor 5 minutes, including the layers for control. PCL membranes were placed between two frames of \n\npolycarbonate (PC) with thickness in the range of 0.1-0-3, obtained by a machine press. The films were cut into \n\n4x4 cm2 frames, with a centred square 1x1 cm2 hole. Hydrogels with concentration of 1% (w/v) were prepared \n\nby dissolving 10 mg/mL of EAK 16-II in PBS. For the functionalized scaffold, three layers of hydrogel were \n\nprepared labelled as Hydrogel 1, Hydrogel 2, and Hydrogel 3. For each layer were prepared a mixture with 15 \n\n?L (0.15 mg of SAP) of EAK-hydrogel, 11 ?L of PBS, 2 ?L of rhFGF, and 2 ?L of IL?6, these last two at \n\ndifferent concentration, and differing the concentration from layer to layer, as shown in Table 9. This mixture \n\nwas prepared on time in Eppendorf and placed on top of PCL membranes, Figure 4.8. \n\n\n\n \n\n77 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 9 Concentration of HVP, rhFGFG, and IL-6 for each layer. \n\nSamples HVP % (w/v) Samples rhFGF % (w/v) IL?6 % (w/v) \n\nPCL 1 8.6 Hydrogel 1 0.016 0.00064 \n\nPCL 2 6 Hydrogel 2 0.0032 0.0032 \n\nPCL 3 3.4 Hydrogel 3 0.00064 0.016 \n\n \n\nFrom bottom to top, the assembly was done by placing PCL layers from highest to lowest concentration \n\nof HVP, labelled, respectively, as PCL 1, PCL 2, and PCL 3, Table 9. \n\nThe scaffold for control used the same procedure for stacking, but in its turn the hydrogel layers \n\nincluded only 10 ?L of EAK?hydrogel. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAfter assembling, a 40 ?L solution, containing ~3\u00d7105 cells, was implanted on top of the functionalized \n\nscaffold, repeating the procedure for the control scaffold. Both scaffolds were immersed in culture media. After \n\n3 days, scaffolds were rinsed several times using PBS. Human h-osteoblasts cells were fixed for 10 minutes \n\nwith a solution of 4% (w/v) of PFA in PBS at room temperature, pH 8. After washing it three times with Tris-\n\nBuffered Saline (TBS) for 5 minutes each, the samples were incubated with 0.05 M of ammonium chloride in \n\nPBS for 10 minutes, to reduce auto-florescence. Then, three additional 5 minutes washes were performed with \n\nTBS; and a solution consisting of 2% v/v of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and of 0.3% v/v of Triton X-100 in \n\nTBS was added for 30 minutes, to block non-specific bonds and permeabilize the cells. The samples were then \n\nincubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with the p-FAK antibody generated in rabbit and diluted 1:500 \n\nin TBS containing BSA 2% w/v and Triton X-100 0.3% v/v. At the end of the incubation, the samples were \n\nwashed and then incubated again for 45 minutes with a second antibody conjugated to the fluorophore Alexa \n\nFluor 488, which emits in the green. After incubation, the samples were washed with TBS three times and then \n\nprepared for analysis under confocal microscopy, by adding a drop of 70% glycerol and sealed with a coverslip. \n\nAll this procedure was performed within a class II microbiological safety cabinet. Image acquisition was \n\nperformed using Leica TCS-NT/SP2 fluorescence confocal microscope and the matching Leica software, \n\nprovided by Leica Microsystems GmbH (Wetzlar, Germany). Scaffold\u2019s thickness was measured using a digital \n\nmicrometre.  \n\nFigure 4.8 Scaffold assembly: the frame fixing the PCL layers, and hydrogel placed between the layers.  \n\n\n\n \n\n78 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n79 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 5 \u2013 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n5.1 Contact angle analysis \n\nSilanized samples using the conditions for treatment 03, PCL_03 and PCL_03_ F, where the last one \n\nreceived an additional bio-functionalization with a covalent immobilization of HVP at the surface, were \n\nsubmitted for contact angle measurements. Data are reported as the average of five separate measurements. The \n\nwater contact angle measurements showed that both samples drastically improved their wettability, as shown in \n\nTable 10, since they were characteristically hydrophobic before treatment. The contact angle for samples only \n\nsubmitted to silanization (PCL_03) present complete wettability (?=0\u00ba), while samples that were bio-\n\nfunctionalized show a slightly decrease in the wettability (?=25\u00ba). \n\n \n\nTable 10 Wettability. Contact angle value of water, as average value obtained from 5 measurements. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe present values for contact angle after plasma treatment demonstrated a strongly increase in \n\nwettability suggesting that the plasma-treated PCL surfaces contain many hydrophilic groups, thus indicating \n\nthe generation of functional groups and/or morphological changes on the PCL surfaces. Bio-functionalized \n\nsamples present less favourable wettability, a fact that can be explained by the presence of more molecules on \n\nthe surface, affecting the disposal of the water drop, and, consequently, affecting the contact angle measure. \n\nUsually, untreated PCL has a contact angle above of 90\u00ba, indicating the natural hydrophobic characteristic of \n\nthis polymer. The introduction of Ar-containing polar groups in the fibres surface resulted in a significant change \n\nof hydrophilicity. After treating the PCL fibres, the water contact angle decreased meaning that APTES-\n\nprecursor hydrolysed the amide bonds resulting in amine functional groups on the PCL surfaces. These \n\nfunctional groups, deposited by plasma, increased the surface energy of the fibres, contributing to the lower \n\nwater contact angle, thus making the fibre surface less hydrophobic. After APP treatment, the water droplet was \n\nabsorbed into the fibres immediately, showing complete wettability, and a water contact angle of 0\u00ba was \n\nobserved.  \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Morphological characterization of PCL fibres \n\n In this study, we explored the electrospinning capability to produce micro- and nanofibres of PCL to \n\ngenerate 3D scaffolds for tissue engineering. First, we focused in the control of the working parameters ideal \n\nSamples Contact angle, ?

Second, we selected the best fibres for coating the surface \n\nto improve their biocompatibility. We selected the fibres based on their fibre diameter and porosity like the ones \n\nof ECM tissues, and with morphologies suitable for cell attachment and proliferation.  \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Effect of coaxial air flow and polymer concentration \n\n A series of experiments were carried out when the initial polymer concentration was varied, in presence \n\nor absence of coaxial air flow. Solutions were processed with PCL concentrations varying from 25 to 30% in \n\nHFIP, and varying the pressure of coaxial air flow from 0 to 0.2 bar, at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/h, a tip -target \n\ndistance of 22 cm, and an applied voltage of 20 kV. SEM micrographs were used to analyse the influence of \n\nboth parameters on the resulting morphology, and results are shown in Figure 5.1.  \n\nFor 25% PCL, electrospinning process produced primarily polymer beads, and sparse fibres, (Figure \n\n5.1 A, B, and C). This situation is improved when at the same concentration, the process is carried with the \n\npresence of coaxial air flow (0.2 bar), (Figure 5.1 D, E, and F). At concentration of 30% PCL beads were still \n\nvisible, (Figure 5.1 G, H, and I). However, in the presence of coaxial air flow, the number of beads significantly \n\ndecreased, resulting in fibres with almost consistent morphology (Figure 5.1 J, K, and L). SEM micrographs \n\nshowed that the presence of air flow has a positive influence in reducing beads for both concentrations. Results \n\nfor 30% PCL were favourable than for 25% PCL. Changing the polymer concentration could alter the solution \n\nviscosity. For 25% PCL is expected a solution with lower viscosity than 30% PCL and it has been proven that \n\ncontinuous and smooth fibres cannot be obtained in very low viscosity. The unfavourable results given for 25% \n\nPCL fibres may be explained by this fact, and by the insufficiency of chain entanglements to stabilize the jet. \n\nThe results allowed the selection of fibres using 30% PCL in presence of coaxial air flow for further studies. \n\n \n\n5.2.2 Effect of tip-target distance and flow rate \n\n Electrospun fibres for concentration of 30% PCL were used to vary the tip-target distance from 22 to \n\n30 cm; however, tip-target distance had no significant effect on the electrospun fibres morphology, as shown in \n\nFigure 31, where the micrographs were practically undistinguishable. The morphological structure can be \n\nslightly changed by changing the solution flow rate, as shown in the same Figure 5.2. At the flow rate of 0.1 \n\nmL/h, a few big beads were observed on the fibres. The flow rate could affect electrospinning process. \n\nGenerally, lower flow rate is more recommended as the polymer solution will get enough time for polarization, \n\noppositely to high flow rate that usually leads to beaded fibres with thick diameters. Contrary to what was \n\nexpected, the presence of beads and beaded fibres was decreased for higher flow rate (0.2 mL h?1). For the \n\nresults using lower tip-target distance, it was assumed that solution jets were elongated and solidified quickly \n\nafter they flowed out of the needle tip. Lower distances are usual responsible for thinner fibre diameters, as can \n\nbe observed. However, due to the presence of beads, the fibres respected to higher flow rate and tip-target \n\ndistance, (Figure 5.2 D, E, and F), were the ones selected for surface treatment. \n\n\n\n \n\n81 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 Scanning electron micrographs of PCL electrospun nanofibres depicting the effect of different \n\npolymer concentration (25 and 30% of PCL in HFIP), and the influence of coaxial air flow, while the \n\nother parameters remain equal. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAir \n\nFlow \n\n[bar] \n\n(%) \n\nPCL \n\n SEM images \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n- \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n- \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n82 \n\n \n\nFlow rate  \n\n(mL h?1) \n\nDistance \n\n(cm) \n\nSEM images \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.2 Scanning electron micrographs of PCL electrospun nanofibres depicting the effect of tip-target \n\ndistance (22 and 30 cm), and the influence of variety in low flow rates (0.1 and 0.2 mL h?1), while the \n\nother parameters remain equal. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2.3 Effect of surface treatment \n\n The change in surface topography on PCL nanofibres before and after plasma modification by argon-\n\ndriven plasma was determined by SEM. Three samples: a matrix without coating, a matrix coated with treatment \n\n03 (PCL_03), and a matrix coated with treatment 04 (PCL_04), were selected for SEM examination. PCL fibres \n\nwith 30% polymer concentration, collected at 30 cm of tip-target distance, at a flow rate of 0.2 mL h?1 were \n\nselected for surface treatment using plasma polymer deposition with APP method. The results were compared \n\nwith surfaces without being treated, and the results are shown in Figure 5.3. Based on the SEM micrographs, \n\nplasma treatment had no significant effect on the surface morphology of PCL fibres. All samples present a \n\nsmooth surface topography, with reduce quantity of beads. Based on the micrographs for not-coated (Figure 5.3 \n\nA, B, and C) and coated-PCL_03 (Figure 5.3 D, E, and F), plasma treatment did not change the porosity of the \n\nfibres. Both have highly porous structures with interconnected pores. However, for PCL_04 (Figure 5.3 G, H, \n\nand I) open porosity in the fibres, point-bounded junctions, and melting of thinner fibres can be observed.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n83 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 Scanning electron micrographs of PCL electrospun nanofibres depicting the effect of plasma \n\nsurface treatment, for treatments 03 and 04, and comparing with non-coated surfaces. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe average diameter of the collected electrospun PCL fibres was 190 nm, with fibres ranging from 16 \n\nto 696 nm, which indicates their dimensional characteristics as micro- and nanofibres. For each case, fibre \n\ndiameter was obtained with an average of ~200 measurements, and the fibres distribution is shown in Figure \n\n5.4. There\u2019s more frequency of fibres ranging from 100 to 200 nm for all the matrices.  \n\n \n\nNormally the fibre diameter of the matrices conform to the structural properties of the ECM are on the \n\norder of 80?500 nm. The diameter of electrospun PCL nanofibres was around 190 nm, suggesting their potential \n\napplications as tissue engineering scaffolds, capable to provide ECM-like morphologies. SEM images showed \n\nthat obtained fibres were continuous and almost bead free, with interconnected microfibre and web-like \n\nnanofibre formation between. High scaffold porosity is preferable for cell seeding, adhesion and tissue in-\n\ngrowth because of high surface area-to-volume ratio, which elicits better diffusion of oxygen and nutrients into \n\nthe scaffolds.

APTES represents a popular choice as it \n\nallows for further attachment of molecules through its terminal amines and exhibits self-assembly. The \n\nsilanization reaction aim to provide a more uniform monolayer surface with an aminopropyl-terminal, resulted \n\nfrom the anhydrous conditions where it happens. There are several reactions in the silanization process that will \n\nFigure 5.4 Fibre diameter distribution of nano-fibrous membrane.

Ideally, the amine group \n\nshould point toward the liquid phase, leaving free amine groups available for further functionalization.96 \n\n \n\n \n\nHowever, obtaining a uniform monolayer with amine groups oriented away from the underlying \n\nsubstrate can be a complex issue, as APTES is very sensitive to many reaction conditions, such as induced \n\ncondensation reactions. Hydrogen bonding can result in unhydrolyzed APTES molecules with intact ethoxy \n\ngroups adsorbing on the initial covalently bound APTES layer, resulting in vertical multilayering. In this case, \n\nAPTES molecules physisorb to each other on an already APTES-treated surface, as seen in Figure 5.6.

Some condensation may \n\noccur between APTES molecules and the native interface. Red circles denote bonding (both covalent and \n\nhydrogen bonding) while the highlighted section is meant to demonstrate that APTES molecules are bound \n\nat multiple sites through the film.97 \n\n\n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\nThis fact suggests that the thickness of the deposited layer can disfavour the silanization process, as a \n\nthicker film may come from condensation of APTES at the surface. Furthermore, a higher concentration of the \n\nAPTES molecule does not mean that all these molecules are available for further functionalization, indicating \n\nthe necessity for two types of chemical analysis at the surface to prove the efficiency of the plasma treatment. \n\nOne to evaluate the quantity of APTES, and another to evaluate it configuration on the surface.  \n\nThe efficiency of plasma on the surfaces was studied by Maffei, A. et al., where they conducted X-ray \n\nphotoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.94 This is a surface sensitive quantitative spectroscopic technique, \n\nused to analyse the surface chemistry of a material, by measuring the elemental composition, chemical state, \n\nand electronic state. In their studies, the atomic ratios Si/C=O and N/Si were measured, and the results are \n\npresented in Table 11. N/Si ratio indicates the integrity of the APTES molecules after plasma treatment and the \n\nefficiency of the functionalization after treatment with HVP; while Si/C=O ratio gives indications about the \n\nconcentration of the APTES molecules on the surface. They determined the Si/C=O ratio allowing the selection \n\nof PCL_01, PCL_03, and PCL_04 as the matrices with ideal APTES concentration for creating a gradient. The \n\nratio N/Si was expected to have a variety as the one observed in the Si/C=O ratio, and if the APTES is intact, \n\nthe N/Si ratio must be 1. Based on these principles, PCL_01 would indicate a higher efficient rate of \n\nfunctionalization, followed by PCL_03, and the last would be PCL_04. Film thickness matched with the Si/C=O \n\nratio, but it can be understood as an aftermath of the APTES condensation at the surface, as described herein. \n\nThey proceeded with the selective HVP immobilization on the layers where the results were equally expected \n\nto have the same variety from layer to layer. A significant increase in the N/Si ratio was expected, to support \n\nthe idea that APTES molecules were oriented in a way to allow functionalization with HVP. The results were \n\nunsatisfactory, indicating a negative influence of the HVP on the functionalization of the PCL_04 layer observed \n\nfrom the ?N/Si, and did not match with the primary Si/C=O ratio.  \n\n \n\nTable 11 Si/C=O and N/Si atomic ratios for plasma treated PCL samples.

The analysis of the content of nitrate in the dissolved silanized and functionalized layers by the \n\nTotal Kjeldahl Nitrogen method confirmed the concentration of APTES obtained with the Si/C=O ratio from \n\nXPS results. The nitrate content in the silanized layers comes from the titration of the nitrogen provided by the \n\namino groups presented in the APTES molecules, while the nitrate content in the bio-functionalized layers, \n\nlabelled PCL_01_F, PCL_03_F, and PCL_04_F, comes from the nitrogen provided by the amino groups present \n\nin the APTES molecules and present in the peptide sequence. For this reason, was expected an increase in the \n\nN/Si ratio. \n\n \n\nTable 12 Total nitrogen content in silanized vs. functionalized surfaces. \n\n \n\n \n\n The colorimetric assay verified that PCL_01 was the more functionalized layer, supporting the previous \n\nXPS results. Unexpectedly, PCL_04 resulted in a zero value for functionalization, and Pure PCL (layers not \n\nsubmitted to any kind of treatment) presented a content of N atoms, contradicting it hydrophobic character. \n\nHowever, the nitrogen content analysis for the layers with posterior functionalization with protein \n\nimmobilization has increased; a measurement that had given inconclusive results in the XPS analysis. It \n\nsuggested the presence of well-oriented amino groups able to covalently link to HVP. The concentration of \n\nAPTES is proportional to the concentration of the immobilized molecules at the surface. The functionalization \n\nresulted, in terms of HVP present at the surface, from an increase to a decrease in it concentration, in PCL_01_F, \n\nPCL_03_F, and PCL_04_F, with positive influence in all cases, allowing to create a gradient from adhesive \n\nmolecules at the surface for further studies.  \n\n \n\n5.4 Cell adhesion \n\nA covalent binding method was used to immobilize HVP on the surface of electrospun layers. The film \n\ncreated was used to test the adhesion activity of osteoblastic cells. Cell adhesion properties of the silanized and \n\nbio-functionalized were compared and are shown in Figure 5.7. Adhesion of cultured osteoblasts on PCL \n\nnanofibres was evaluated by MTT assay after incubating cells for 2 hours. Data are reported as mean and \n\nstandard deviation (SD) of three measurements. Figure 5.7 a) illustrates the number of cells that adhere to the \n\ncontrol PCL matrix (C) and the number of cells that adhere to the PCL matrices after plasma treatment 01, 03, \n\nand 04 (PCL_01, PCL_03, and PCL_04, respectively). Figure 5.7 b) illustrates the comparison in cell adhesion \n\nSamples N [w/w] Samples N [w/w] ?N \n\nPure PCL (2.28 mg) 0.0016    \n\nPCL_01 (0.55 mg) 0.020 PCL_01_F (0.23 mg) 0.086 0.066 \n\nPCL_03 (0.33 mg) 0.016 PCL_03_F (0.25 mg) 0.060 0.044 \n\nPCL_04 (1.01 mg) 0 PCL_04_F (0.32 mg) 0.034 0.034 \n\n\n\n \n\n88 \n\n \n\nbetween the matrices submitted to different plasma treatment and the matrices with further functionalization \n\nwith HVP peptide. This graph reported the (number of cells on HVP functionalized electrospun matrix measured \n\nwith MTT assay/number of cells seeded on electrospun matrix)\u00d7100. Data is reported as mean\u00b1SD. Statistical \n\nanalysis was performed using the paired Student\u2019s t-test, using Graph-Pad Prism 3.03 (San Diego, California, \n\nUSA). P values&lt;0.05 (Figure 5.7 a)) and P values&lt;0.01 (Figure 5.7 b)) were considered statistically significant. \n\nPlasma treatment improves osteoblast adhesion, but the different plasma treatments do not modify cell adhesion. \n\nThe increase in the case PCL_01 (Figure 57 b) is significant with respect to its control. The trend is an \n\nimprovement of osteoblast adhesion due to functionalization. The anchoring of HVP is important and scaffold \n\ntreated differently by plasma give the possibility to modify HVP concentration and osteoblast are influenced by \n\ndifferent peptide concentration. \n\n \n\n  \n\nCell adhesion onto the layers enriched with HVP was greater than silanized layers, excepting for 04. It \n\nwas verified the highest adhesion in the substrate 01, the same sample that had also resulted in the substrate \n\nwith higher concentration of APTES. This permits to conclude that cells recognized the surface chemistries \n\nprovided by the silanization, which had influenced their attachment. When comparing both functionalized with \n\nHVP layers and layers only submitted to plasma treatment, it gives an important result indicating that the cell \n\nadhesion does not depend on the surface treatment, but in the concentration of HVP immobilized. In fact, plasma \n\ntreatment had no significant effect on cell adhesion; however, it directs the immobilization of adhesive proteins, \n\ninducing an increase of the adherent cells through protein immobilization. Cells were more prone to adhere to \n\nthe substrate presenting HVP at its surface, even if an uncommon situation happened for 04 layers, where cells \n\nadhere more to the layer without bio-functionalization. This confirms the previous idea that cell adhesion not \n\nonly depends in the presence of HVP, but it is also concentration-dependent of this molecule. Adhesion in \n\nplasma treated samples was poor, yet, cells reflected some cellular adhesion. \n\nFigure 5.7 a) Comparison of cell adhesion on control matrix and matrices submitted to different plasma treatments.

P &lt;0.01 vs. silanized surfaces.  \n\na) a) \nb) \n\n\n\n \n\n89 \n\n \n\nIt was first observed that in two cases the presence of HVP favoured the cell adhesion, indicating that \n\ncells recognized the properties of the molecule as a chemotactic cue. But, it does not allow the creation of a \n\nwell-defined gradient along the scaffold. The concentration of HVP should increase along the scaffold as the \n\ndriving forces for cells to migrate and proliferate within are expected to decrease due to the restrictions imposed \n\nby the structure itself. Since it was not possible to prove the efficiency of this method for all layers, the desired \n\ngradient will be always susceptible to failure. Plasma surface treatment through APP has been demonstrated as \n\na well suitable technique to develop interfaces capable to improve cell adhesion at the implant surfaces.98,99 \n\nHowever, the unfavourable results can be assigned to an inaccurate surface treatment using this method. Some \n\nof the main factors to explain the poor cell adhesion in the bio-functionalized layers can be related to an \n\ninadequate selection of the PCL silanized layer, as a  result obtained from the operating parameters used in the \n\nAPPJ, to a possible formation of a vertical multi-layering created with APTES deposited, compromising the \n\nsilanization and leaving less functional groups to react with HVP, to the time for incubation, that may have not \n\nbeen enough for cells to detect the presence of surface chemistries and stablish interactions with them, to the \n\nnumber of cells seeded. Although, these results have given important indications point for further \n\nfunctionalization. Nevertheless, PCL layers were used to perform the assembly of the scaffold to evaluate their \n\ninfluence in cells functions and to complement, or contradict, the results described in this section. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5 Cell migration into designed 3D scaffold \n\nTo observe cell attachment and proliferation on/within the scaffolds, fluorescent images were taken on \n\nthe 3rd day of seeding by confocal microscope immediately after fixing the cells. Both scaffolds, functionalized \n\nand control were investigated. Confocal microscope permits to obtain images with reduced blurring, in the \n\nperpendicular and parallel optical sections. Confocal microscope can penetrate the sample and scan it with a \n\nmaximum depth of 50 ?m. The scaffold resulted in a thickness of 0.229 \u00b1 0.005 (mm) and 0.320 \u00b1 0.005 (mm) \n\nfor functionalized and control, respectively. Since confocal microscope was not able to scan all the thickness of \n\nthe matrix, was first examined the top of the scaffold (where the cells were seeded), collecting the images until \n\npossible depth, and then, was examined the bottom (where is supposed to start the regeneration process), until \n\nthe depth where the presence of the first cells could be detectable. \n\n\n\n \n\n90 \n\n \n\nAfter 3 days of seeding, the cells could migrate, at least, till a depth of 50 ?m. Functionalized scaffold \n\npresented, at this depth, significant cell\u2019s populations (in green), as showed in Figure 5.8. The images were \n\ntaken from different regions of the same xy plane. Comparing with the control scaffold, it is notable the increase \n\nin cell number, indicating the benefits of rhFGF in sustaining cell proliferation in the functionalized architecture. \n\nThe presence of cells at this depth can also demonstrate and prove the existence of sufficient and interconnected \n\nporosity allowing cells to travel within the structure. It is important to note the presence of cells in the control \n\nscaffold at 40 ?m, evidencing the existence of some hydrophobic character and cell\u2019s ability to perform their \n\nfunctions, yet narrowly, in environments with the same characteristics. \n\n \n\nWhile examining the bottom of the scaffold, a substantial difference in cell number could be \n\ndistinguished. Fluorescent signals at the bottom of the scaffold were barely detectable, indicating the absence \n\nof cellular populations at the bottom. Images were taken along the z-axis (from bottom to top) and the first cells \n\nwere observed at a depth of 30 ?m and 17 ?m for functionalized and control scaffolds, respectively, were scarce \n\ncells appeared, and the concentration of cell\u2019s populations is practically inexistent, Figure 5.9. Morphological \n\nrestrictions, low porosity or porosity conditioned by the insertion and immobilization of biological moieties, \n\nand well as inappropriate concentrations of these molecules to create the gradient, are the basic findings to \n\nexplain the break in cell proliferation and migration. Also, the insufficient seeding period, hydrogel \n\nconcentration, and the fact of the assembly of the scaffold had been done manually are aspects that can influence \n\nthe migration of the cells within the structure. Cells were closer to the bottom in the scaffold for control. This \n\nfact does not guarantee more efficiency when compared to the functionalized scaffold, since the seeding was \n\nFigure 5.8 Confocal microscope images for the top of the scaffold. Above, cell migration at a depth of 50 ?m in the \n\nfunctionalized scaffold, after 3 days of culture. Below, cell migration at a depth of 40 ?m in control scaffold, \n\nafter 3 days of culture. \n\n\n\n \n\n91 \n\n \n\ndone in an open petri dish and cells could have been detached from the structure and reached these regions \n\nthrough the culture medium.  \n\nThe scaffold\u2019s thickness presents a contradictory result. It was expected a thickness in the range of 0.30 \n\nto 0.50 mm, with a thicker structure for the functionalized scaffold. However, the assembly faced some problems \n\nin the stacking due to the vulnerability of the system that may had influenced the final thickness. \n\n \n\n \n\nWhen assembling, we faced two major problems: a trouble in stack the PCL bio-functionalized layers \n\nin the frames, and the difficulty to produce hydrogels in appropriate concentration. Hydrogel concentration was \n\nselected based on the experiments of Koutsopoulos, S. et al., where they studied the release kinetics for a variety \n\nof proteins in a wide range of molecular mass, hydrodynamic radii, and isoelectric point.100 The release studies \n\nconsisted in the determination of the diffusion coefficients of lysozyme, trypsin inhibitor, BSA, and IgG \n\npresented inside a nanofibre SAP-hydrogel scaffold and released into solution, using the single-molecule \n\napproach. The release kinetics suggested that protein diffusion through nanofibre hydrogels depended primarily \n\non the size of the protein. rhFGF and IL?6 are in the same range of molecular mass and size of the proteins used \n\nin this study, where the release was performed through 1% (wt/vol) peptide hydrogel. This concentration was \n\nadopted to build the EAK 16?II hydrogel; however, when assembling, the hydrogel formed a single dense drop \n\non the PCL surfaces, which was then spread out of the matrix when the next PCL layer was placed on its top. \n\nIn the following layers, 0.5% (wt/vol) peptide hydrogel was produced, but the material was completely absorbed \n\nby the PCL layers. These observations demonstrate unsuitable hydrogel concentration for incorporating the \n\nsoluble molecules and to form interwoven nanofibre controlled structure. It was not perceptible if the failure to \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9 Confocal microscope images for the bottom of the scaffold. Above, presence of cells at 30 ?m from the \n\nbottom in the functionalized scaffold. Below, presence of cells at 17 ?m from the bottom, in the control scaffold, \n\nafter 3 days of culture. \n\n\n\n \n\n92 \n\n \n\nobtain the hydrogel was due to its concentration, or if it is related to the concentration of the growth \n\nfactors/inflammatory cytokines. On other hand, the problem with PCL nanofibres is due to is vulnerability to \n\nrupture after functionalization. As the available material was not enough to produce samples bigger than 1x1 \n\ncm2, at this area, the samples easily bend, and it is difficult to place them straight on the frames. These problems \n\ndirectly influenced the success of the final 3D structure, and, consequently, cell migration since the layers were \n\nnot concentric, neither intact along the scaffold. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n93 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 6 \u2013 CONCLUSIONS \n\n \nA nano-fibrous biomimetic scaffold was developed by assembling PCL nanofibres layers with \n\nhydrogels from self-assembling peptides into a 3D structure. PCL nanofibres were obtained by electrospinning, \n\nwhere the working parameters were studied and tuned to obtain fibres with diameters in the nano-range. Nano-\n\nfibres with average diameter of 190 nm were obtained for a concentration of 30% of PCL in HFIP, at a flow \n\nrate of 0.2 mL h?1 in the presence of coaxial air flow (0.2 bar), at a tip-target distance of 30 cm. The collected \n\nfibres were submitted to a surface plasma treatment and the SEM analysis verified that this treatment had no \n\nsignificant effect on the PCL matrices in terms of porosity and fibre topography. However, PCL surface \n\ntreatment by Ar-driven APP successfully resulted in a significant increase of the surface hydrophilicity, \n\nallowing the anchor of the bioactive molecule HVP at different concentrations. Plasma treatment improves \n\nosteoblast adhesion, but the different plasma treatments do not modify cell adhesion. h-osteoblast adhesion on \n\nthe surfaces has revealed to be concentration-dependent of HVP molecules. Control and bio-functionalized \n\nscaffolds manifested limitations for cell migration from the top to the bottom after a super attack of 3 days. The \n\nintroduction of chemical guidance molecules permitted a better cell proliferation in the bio-functionalized \n\nscaffold, where it could be seen the presence of considerable cell\u2019s populations until a depth of 50 ?m, from the \n\ntop to the bottom.  \n\nIt was expected to develop a novel bone substitute capable to promote osteoblasts penetration along the \n\nentire bony support. The experiment presented some barriers along the process, although some remarkable \n\nconclusions could be taken from what was investigated. First, it was confirmed the efficiency of APP as a \n\nsuccessful surface plasma treatment to contradict the original hydrophobic character of PCL. This fact \n\ncontributed to the immobilization of HVP that, even though it has not been possible to determine it precise \n\nconcentration, was capable to enhance cell attachment for some of the treatment conditions studied. Cell \n\nattachment, proliferation and migration is essential for long-term success of the implant. The provided scaffold \n\noffered some constraints to the cell\u2019s functions through it thickness. An excessive density of hydrogel, after \n\nincorporation of rhFGF was point out as one of the reasons for unaccomplished scaffold design. \n\n \n\n6.1 Future perspectives \n\n Once it was not possible to demonstrate the efficiency of the designed scaffold for cell proliferation and \n\nmigration, future studies are recommended to optimize both individual systems that constitute the idea here \n\npresented.  In author\u2019s opinion, the first step should be optimizing APP parameters and perform new XPS studies \n\nto obtain correct silanization of the matrices, in a way to guarantee a more suitable immobilization of the \n\nadhesive molecules. In a first approach, plasma surface treatment seemed to enhance the surfaces capability to \n\nimmobilize bioactive molecules, however, the silanization performed was not successful to obtain a coherent \n\ngradient able to be employed in the scaffold as it was firstly thought. After obtaining a coherent and efficient \n\n\n\n \n\n94 \n\n \n\ngradient, biological assays should be investigated. For these studies, at least three replicates per sample should \n\nbe done to confirm the results. The author suggests that should be created, besides a control scaffold as the one \n\ndescribed, a scaffold in which was possible to investigate the influence of each single molecule, HVP, rh-FGF \n\nand IL-6, in the cell\u2019s viability. The comparison of all these structures will allow to conclude about the most \n\nvaluable cues for signalize cells and establish a more accurate regeneration process.   \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n95 \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\n \nThe author is grateful to Alessandro Maffei for having studied the Electrospinning and the APPJ \n\noperating parameters, to Professor Alessandro Patelli from Physics Department in University of Padua and Dr. \n\nPaolo Scopece from C\u00e0 Foscari University, Mestre, Venice, for their help in surface treatment with APPJ and \n\nSEM analysis, to Professor Paola Brun from Department of Molecular Medicine in University of Padua, for \n\nhaving conducted all the biological assays, and to Department of Chemistry from University of Catania for \n\nhaving performed the contact angle measurements. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n97 \n\n \n\nREFERENCES \n \n\n \n\n1.
