Esta previs\u00e3o \u00e9 aplicada como ferramenta essencial para o aconselhamento parental de modo a \n\nprovidenciar um plano de cuidados perinatais apropriado. Durante uma aut\u00f3psia fetal, a idade \n\ngestacional \u00e9 uma vari\u00e1vel a ter em considera\u00e7\u00e3o, particularmente utilizada aquando de situa\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ntermina\u00e7\u00e3o de gravidez medicamente assistida e/ou infantic\u00eddios. No nosso caso, foram colecionadas \n\nobserva\u00e7\u00f5es representativas da popula\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa da regi\u00e3o Centro-Sul de Portugal atrav\u00e9s do \n\nprocedimento de v\u00e1rias aut\u00f3psias fetais, provenientes do Hospital de Egas Moniz (CHLO \u2013 Centro \n\nHospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental). Desde h\u00e1 v\u00e1rios anos que o sector de fetopatologia deste hospital tem \n\nvindo a analisar e avaliar os casos de mortalidade fetal pertencentes \u00e0 regi\u00e3o Centro-Sul de Portugal. \n\nCada caso de aut\u00f3psia fetal produz um relat\u00f3rio representativo das medidas e pesos associados ao \n\nindiv\u00edduo em causa, entre outras informa\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00e9dicas relevantes; ap\u00f3s a sua conclus\u00e3o, cada relat\u00f3rio \n\n\u00e9 arquivado num dossier (organizado cronologicamente). Este tipo de processamento e \n\narmazenamento de informa\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o proporciona um acesso direto nem estruturado aos valores \n\nantropom\u00e9tricos espec\u00edficos previamente registados, derivados de relat\u00f3rios m\u00e9dicos elaborados \n\ndurante um ou mais procedimentos de aut\u00f3psia fetal. Cada relat\u00f3rio arquivado \u00e9, ent\u00e3o, tido em \n\nconsidera\u00e7\u00e3o como independente de todos os outros casos, tornando trabalhoso e demorado qualquer \n\nabordagem ao estudo do seu conte\u00fado. Para enfrentar este desafio prim\u00e1rio, foi necess\u00e1rio desenvolver \n\numa base de dados, assim como toda a metodologia relacionada com a inser\u00e7\u00e3o de dados na mesma. \n\nNeste presente estudo, um banco de dados nada mais \u00e9 sen\u00e3o um dep\u00f3sito seguro para informa\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nservindo o prop\u00f3sito de acomodar estruturalmente dados. Foram registados 24 par\u00e2metros fetais para \n\ncada caso individual, incluindo idade gestacional e medi\u00e7\u00f5es de dist\u00e2ncias e pesos de caracter\u00edsticas \n\nantropom\u00e9tricas e \u00f3rg\u00e3os, respetivamente. Obtidas de acordo com o protocolo em vigor, segue a \n\nexaustiva lista de medi\u00e7\u00f5es fetais registadas em cada aut\u00f3psia: idade gestacional, comprimento total, \n\ncomprimento craniocaudal, per\u00edmetro cef\u00e1lico, per\u00edmetro tor\u00e1cico, per\u00edmetro abdominal, comprimento \n\nde p\u00e9, comprimento da m\u00e3o, comprimento do dedo m\u00e9dio, dist\u00e2ncia intercomissural, comprimento do \n\nfiltro, dist\u00e2ncia entre os cantos internos, dist\u00e2ncia entre os cantos externos, comprimento da fenda \n\npalpebral esquerda, comprimento da fenda palpebral direita, comprimento do pavilh\u00e3o auricular \n\nesquerdo, comprimento do pavilh\u00e3o auricular direito, peso corporal, peso dos rins, peso do timo, peso \n\ndo ba\u00e7o, peso do f\u00edgado, peso dos pulm\u00f5es, e peso doas gl\u00e2ndulas suprarrenais. \u00d3rg\u00e3os emparelhados \n\n(pulm\u00f5es, por exemplo) s\u00e3o representados pelo seu peso combinado. Como unidades, s\u00e3o utilizadas \n\nsemanas (idade gestacional), cent\u00edmetros (comprimentos e dist\u00e2ncias), e gramas (pesos). Foi gerado \n\nc\u00f3digo base para produzir programas capazes de criar e interagir com o construto. Ap\u00f3s estipular a \n\nestrutura da base de dados, todos os processos de inser\u00e7\u00e3o e consulta de informa\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o geridos por \n\nalgoritmos especificamente engendrados de modo a prevenir a adultera\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o propositada dos dados \n\nregistados. A linguagem de programa\u00e7\u00e3o adotada foi Python, vers\u00e3o 2.7 devido \u00e0s suas bibliotecas \n\n(notavelmente: SQLite3, NumPy, e SciPy) e por ser uma linguagem multiparadigm\u00e1tica. \n\nA estrutura da base de dados \u00e9 simples, apesar de relacional. \u00c9 constitu\u00edda por uma tabela em que \n\nlinhas e colunas representam, respetivamente, os indiv\u00edduos e os valores dos seus par\u00e2metros fetais \n\nregistados durante a aut\u00f3psia (incluindo uma chave prim\u00e1ria). Assim, cada linha \u00e9 representativa de \n\num relat\u00f3rio de aut\u00f3psia fetal, com a sua pr\u00f3pria identidade, e medidas e pesos associados. Tal como a \n\nnossa base de dados, simples \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m o mecanismo de inser\u00e7\u00e3o de dados. Todos os relat\u00f3rios \n\nescritos tiveram de ter a sua informa\u00e7\u00e3o transferida para o formato digital. Para esse efeito, foi \n\ndesenvolvido um programa de apoio \u00e0 inser\u00e7\u00e3o de dados. Aquando da sua execu\u00e7\u00e3o, surge uma \n\ninterface compreens\u00edvel que solicita iterativamente ao utilizador os valores registados de cada vari\u00e1vel \n\nde um relat\u00f3rio de aut\u00f3psia fetal. Assim que todos os campos estejam preenchidos, a informa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nrecolhida \u00e9 automaticamente inserida na base de dados, simbolizando um indiv\u00edduo e os seus \n\n\n\n \n\n \nvii \n\n \n\nrespetivos atributos. Uma vez preenchida a base de dados com toda a informa\u00e7\u00e3o necess\u00e1ria, \u00e9 \n\nposs\u00edvel propor uma an\u00e1lise adequada. Na totalidade, recolhemos a informa\u00e7\u00e3o referente a 450 fetos \n\nentre as 13 e as 42 semanas de idade (gestacional). Para o devido efeito, a manipula\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nfoi executada utilizando objetos abstratos baseados em tabelas de dispers\u00e3o (Python) e SPSS. \n\nEste trabalho procurou abordar a precis\u00e3o de diferentes par\u00e2metros fetais em termos de estima\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda idade gestacional, fazendo uso de t\u00e9cnicas de regress\u00e3o e an\u00e1lise em componentes principais \n\n(ACP). Na computa\u00e7\u00e3o dos 2 modelos de regress\u00e3o linear m\u00faltipla, foram utilizados algoritmos \n\nespec\u00edficos de reten\u00e7\u00e3o de vari\u00e1veis baseados na an\u00e1lise de vari\u00e2ncia (estat\u00edstica-F). Enquanto ACP e \n\nregress\u00f5es m\u00faltiplas foram processadas em SPSS, regress\u00f5es polinomiais foram executadas em \n\nPython. Para cada uma das 23 vari\u00e1veis (referente a todos os par\u00e2metros fetais selecionados com a \n\nexce\u00e7\u00e3o de idade gestacional), foram calculadas regress\u00f5es polinomiais de grau k, k ? {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, \n\nderivadas de cada conjunto de pares de pontos vari\u00e1vel-idade. Para todas as regress\u00f5es, m\u00faltiplas e \n\npolinomiais, os valores de R2 (coeficiente de determina\u00e7\u00e3o) foram registados com um valor-p \n\nsignificativo contra a hip\u00f3tese nula de que os coeficientes estimados de cada par\u00e2metro s\u00e3o iguais \n\nzero. Os modelos de regress\u00e3o foram comparados entre si, com base na propor\u00e7\u00e3o de vari\u00e2ncia da \n\nvari\u00e1vel dependente (idade gestacional) previs\u00edvel pela(s) vari\u00e1vel(eis) independente(s), isto \u00e9, o erro \n\nassociado a cada modelo (soma do quadrado dos res\u00edduos). Tendo sido estabelecido um n\u00edvel de \n\nsignific\u00e2ncia de ? = 0.05, cada modelo de regress\u00e3o linear m\u00faltipla foi comparado a cada um dos \n\noutros modelos de regress\u00e3o (polinomial e linear m\u00faltipla); modelos polinomiais foram comparados a \n\noutros modelos derivados do mesmo tipo de regress\u00e3o se e s\u00f3 se partilhassem o mesmo grau k. \n\nRelativamente \u00e0 ACP (com um \u00edndice de KMO de 0.972 e um valor de signific\u00e2ncia pr\u00f3ximo de 0 \n\npara a homocedasticidade), a propor\u00e7\u00e3o de vari\u00e2ncia partilhada entre cada vari\u00e1vel (comunalidade) \n\napresentou maior valor para as vari\u00e1veis comprimento total, comprimento craniocaudal, comprimento \n\ndo p\u00e9. Associativamente, o \u00fanico componente principal retido (com valor pr\u00f3prio maior ou igual a 1) \n\napresenta valores de correla\u00e7\u00e3o maiores entre esses mesmos par\u00e2metros originais (loadings) do que \n\ncom qualquer outra vari\u00e1vel. Podemos colocar a hip\u00f3tese, ent\u00e3o, de que essas vari\u00e1veis sejam \n\nconsideradas poss\u00edveis marcadores de desenvolvimento (preditores confi\u00e1veis de idade gestacional). \n\nDe acordo com os algoritmos de sele\u00e7\u00e3o de vari\u00e1veis (SPSS) utilizados para a computa\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nregress\u00f5es lineares m\u00faltiplas, foram criados 2 modelos explicativos de idade gestacional. Estes \n\nmodelos apresentaram valores de coeficiente de determina\u00e7\u00e3o semelhantes (R2 ? 0.953), assim como \n\nvalores de teste Durbin-Watson adequados. As vari\u00e1veis retidas apresentadas pelos 2 algoritmos foram \n\nsemelhantes entre si, exceto para as vari\u00e1veis representativas de comprimentos total e craniocaudal, \n\nque se verificaram como sendo mutualmente exclusivas. Em ambos os modelos, as vari\u00e1veis \n\nselecionadas foram, em ordem decrescente de pesos-?: peso corporal (? ? 0.393), comprimento do p\u00e9 \n\n(? ? 0.347), comprimento total (? ? 0.266), comprimento craniocaudal (? ? 0.199), pavilh\u00e3o auricular \n\nesquerdo (? ? 0.16), peso dos pulm\u00f5es, e peso das gl\u00e2ndulas suprarrenais. Para as \u00faltimas duas \n\nvari\u00e1veis mencionadas, o valor absoluto do peso-? foi menor ou igual a 0.1. Atrav\u00e9s de compara\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nentre modelos polinomiais foi poss\u00edvel estabelecer um sistema de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o para vari\u00e1veis ou \n\ngrupos de vari\u00e1veis, indicativa da qualidade de cada vari\u00e1vel (associada a um grau de polin\u00f3mio) em \n\nestimar, de acordo com os nossos dados, a idade gestacional. O grupo de vari\u00e1veis com maior valor \n\npara o coeficiente de determina\u00e7\u00e3o, para cada grau polinomial, conteve sempre as vari\u00e1veis \n\ncomprimento total, comprimento craniocaudal, e comprimento do p\u00e9. De entre todas as regress\u00f5es, \n\ncomprimentos total, craniocaudal, e do p\u00e9 est\u00e3o constantemente presentes nos grupos de melhores \n\nprevisores de idade gestacional. Mediante o tipo de regress\u00e3o aplicada, o peso corporal e o \n\ncomprimento da m\u00e3o s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m vari\u00e1veis pertencentes \u00e0 categoria preditiva anterior. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave \n\nFetopatologia; Feto; Previs\u00e3o; Idade gestacional; Agrupamento. \n\n\n\n \n\n \nviii \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nLarge amounts of information are systematically generated throughout the course of scientific \n\nresearch and progress. In our case, observations representing the Portuguese population within the \n\ncentral-southern region of Portugal were collected throughout various foetal autopsy procedures. \n\nGestational age (GA) and measured distances and weights of numerous anthropometric features and \n\norgans, respectively, were recorded per singleton (24 variables in total). This work seeks to elaborate \n\non the accuracy of different foetal parameters in terms of GA estimation, making use of principal \n\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and regression techniques. We created a dataset of 450 foetuses, ranging \n\nfrom 13 to 42 weeks of age, to compute both PCA and regression models. Initial exploratory analysis \n\nshed light onto which variables are most explanatory in terms of foetal development, and are thus most \n\nlikely suitable for predictive rolls. We produced clusters of models, based on coefficient of \n\ndetermination values (R2), by comparing the squared sum of residuals between models (significance \n\nlevel ? = 0.05). Models comprised of linear combinations of different variables exhibited significantly \n\nhigher values of R2 (p-value ? 0.05) when compared to single variable models. Multiple linear \n\nregression models, however, did not exhibit the same statistical significance when compared \n\ninternally. Across all regression models (both polynomial and multiple linear), crown-heel length \n\n(CHL), crown-rump length (CRL), and foot length (FL) are constantly present within the cluster of \n\nbest predictors of GA. Depending on the type of regression analysis applied, body weight (Body), \n\nhand length (HL) also fall onto the same category. Consistent with previously peer-reviewed work, \n\nvariables such as CHL, CRL, and FL are found to be the most reliable sources of information for \n\nestimating developmental age. In cases where such measurements are impossible to obtain, other \n\nfoetal features can be utilized (although less reliable) such as HL, HC, body weight, and ear length. \n\n \n\nKeywords

\n\nIntroduction \n\nPerforming rigorous estimations of GA is invaluable for correct diagnosis and optimum treatment \n\nof disease during the neonatal period. GA prediction is an essential tool for parental counselling and to \n\nplan for appropriate perinatal care. It is also a prime requisite for foetal autopsy, particularly in \n\nsituations of criminal abortion, alleged infanticide, and medically-terminated pregnancies. Previous \n\npeer-reviewed studies have elaborated on the accuracy of different foetal parameters in GA \n\nprediction1, particularly head circumference (HC), HL, FL, CRL, and CHL2 \u2013 5. Model analysis and \n\nhypothesis tests may help determine not only how different measurements and weights are linked to \n\nfoetal developmental age, but also which variables might be classified and ordered in terms of their \n\npredictive capabilities. Regarding anthropometric data analytics, other published papers often \n\napproach the validity of different measured variables for conceptual age estimation6 \u2013 10, and the \n\nquantitative standards of those measurements for foetal and neo-natal autopsy11. Regression analysis \n\nand model fitting are widely accepted and used in this field of work, hence being viewed as reliable \n\ntools for knowledge production12. Other relevant publications may also be found, discussing the \n\nrelationship between different methods of analysis and discriminating regression properties, enabling \n\nmodel validation for subsequent selection13, 14. Currently, the application of analytical and statistical \n\nmethods for the evaluation of information is accomplished with the use of data manipulative \n\nsoftware15, 16. For these computer programs to be beneficial, however, all data must be made digitally \n\navailable. Without a proper data frame, analysis of data becomes tedious and/or unfeasible. \n\n \n\n1.1 Motivation \n\nThe underlying importance of having a well-established database is not only to be able to reliably \n\nkeep information safely stored, but also to enable such data to be subjected to manipulation and \n\nanalysis. The foetopathology and pathological anatomy departments of Hospital de Egas Moniz \n\n(HEM), part of Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Ocidental (CHLO), have since long been creating, \n\ngathering, and evaluating singleton pre-natal and neo-natal clinical autopsy records derived from the \n\npopulation located in the central-southern region of Portugal. Medical professionals register organ \n\nweights, anthropometric distances, and other features for each individual episode so that a diagnosis \n\nmay be conjectured to explain the most likely cause of death. To make any causality assessments, each \n\nmeasured variable must be associated with the value of the most probable gestation period for that \n\nmeasurement; to this effect, a reference table of expected anatomical details at various postmenstrual \n\ngestational periods is utilized. Having fully concluded an autopsy report, all information regarding it is \n\narchived. Thousands of files are stacked in dossiers, making it effortful to inquire such data. Without \n\nthe aid of a more suitable storage-query system, it is not feasible to produce any kind of meaningful \n\nstudies relating the contents of different autopsy reports. A database would have to be created. \n\nMoreover, an efficient way of inputting and manipulating information had to be devised. \n\n \n\n1.2 Objectives \n\nOur primary objective in this study is to devise a method for storing and manipulating information \n\npertaining to the autopsy files collected by CHLO medical professionals. Additionally, we hope to \n\napply different algorithmic approaches to our collected data to, not only test de adequacy of our \n\ndatabase, but also produce meaningful knowledge by using different methodological approaches (such \n\nas PCA, polynomial regression, and multiple regression techniques) that may help establish which \n\nfoetal parameters are most associated to foetal development (gestational age). Another goal is to make \n\nour scripts simple and user-friendly, specifically in terms of database creation, and data insertion and \n\nvisualisation. Thus, data interaction can be easily applied without much background information. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n2 \n\n \n\n1.3 Results and Contributions \n\nWith the application of exploratory analysis and distinct regression techniques, by means of SPSS \n\nand Python scripts, it is possible to check which variables are either most explicative regarding foetal \n\ndevelopment variance or serve best as the basis for GA estimation models, respectively. High values \n\nfor communality (? 0.946) and loading (? 0.972) can be witnessed for CRL, CHL, and FL variables, \n\nwhich account for the shared variance with every other variable and produced component, \n\nrespectively. Another example for GA estimation predictor assessment, is the evaluation of models \n\nwith highest coefficient of determination (CHL, FL, CRL, body weight, and HL) and highest variable \n\n?-weights associated with multiple linear regression (CHL, FL, CRL, body weight, and ear length). \n\nMoreover, by comparing different models in terms of their associated error, regarding statistical \n\nsignificance, it is possible to produce clusters of variables which present the same prediction accuracy, \n\ndespite exhibiting different coefficient of determination values and thus create a variable-based \n\nranking system for GA estimation; for example, CRL, CHL, FL, and body weight are clustered as the \n\nleast error-prone models for a 2nd degree polynomial regression (0.936 ? R2 ? 0.942). \n\nThrough the course of this work, software was developed to enable information gathering and \n\nmanipulation, and derive the newly proposed statistically significant cluster and ranking system (to be \n\napplied to variable regression models). Our contributions in the field of database creation and handling \n\nare made available in a public repository17, as well as the actual database constructed and utilized in \n\nour work. Also, a research article related to our findings (concretely, GA estimation and variable \n\nadequacy) has also been accepted to the 11th International Conference on Practical Applications of \n\nComputational Biology &amp; Bioinformatics18 (PACBB), serving as a perfect peer-review process by \n\nwhich the validity of our endeavours can be testified. \n\n \n\n1.4 Overview \n\nBased on foetal autopsy records, we created a dataset of 450 individuals, each comprised of 24 \n\nfoetal parameters. PCA produced results indicating CHL, CRL, and FL variables as the most \n\nexplanatory in terms of total data variance. By comparing regressions models, Body and HL \n\nparameters were also found to be significantly viable measurements for GA estimation, depending on \n\nthe polynomial degree applied within each regression. We hope to reinforce the many advantages of \n\ndata manipulation by computation over manual activity. With an adequately ample data set, it could be \n\npossible to establish, for example, certain specific pre-natal characteristics associated with a distinct \n\ndisease, enabling pathology detection. Background information regarding this work is discussed in \n\nSection 2, which serves as context for the appreciation for our attempts and achievements. The \n\nfollowing section describes the methodological approaches used (programming language used, \n\nnoteworthy package applications, statistical approaches, etc.). Section 4 presents the results of \n\napplying said methods, which are mostly visual reference tables and figures. Discussion of obtained \n\nresults and final remarks pertain to the 5th Section of this dissertation, where the properties of each \n\napproach are taken into consideration during result evaluation. Section 6 relates to the conclusions \n\nderived from our work, while attempting to foresee possible new outcomes, making use of our data. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n3 \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\n \n\nCase Study: Background and Related Work \n\nFetal and perinatal pathology is mainly a posthumous specialty concerned with the causes and \n\nmechanisms behind the reproductive loss in humans19. In its majority, pregnancy loss occurs in the \n\nfirst half of the gestational period20 \u2013 24. Causes of death in this stage vary depending on the gestational \n\nage of an individual. For instance, chromosomal and genetic defects have their highest frequencies in \n\nearlier weeks \u2013 accounting for approximately 60% of all non-viable, and thus naturally aborted \n\nembryos \u2013 while infections and premature rupture of the membranes are most associated with \n\nmortality during later embryonic stages25 \u2013 28. \n\nFor several years, the foetopathology department of Hospital de Egas Moniz, has been conducting \n\nthe analysis and evaluation of foetal mortality cases pertaining to the central-southern region of \n\nPortugal. Each foetal autopsy produces a physical report file containing, amongst other relevant \n\nmedical information, measurements and weights of the foetus. Whenever a foetopathology instance is \n\nconcluded, the file is then archived within a dossier. This type of information processing and storage \n\ndoes not permit direct access to harboured values in more than a few cases at a time. Reports are \n\nregarded independently of each other, making any data study laborious and time-consuming. To \n\naddress this challenge, we developed a database representing foetal autopsy records. Each report had \n\nto be manually inserted, due to discrepancies of cursive between files, excluding the use of optical \n\ncharacter recognition (OCR) software. \n\n \n\n2.1 Foetal Viability \n\nFoetal viability is the ability or potential of the foetus to survive outside the uterus after birth while \n\nsupported by modern medical techonolgy29; an individual\u2019s viability is largely dependent upon its \n\norgan maturity and environmental conditions. There exists no well-defined set of developmental \n\nvalues \u2013 age, weight, or other measures \u2013 for which a human conceptus becomes automatically \n\nviable30. For instance, seldom does any infant weighing less than 500g persist outside the womb \n\n(although it has been reported). In accordance with the scientific community in this field, 20 to 35 \n\npercent of babies born at 23 weeks of gestation survive, while 50 to 70 percent of babies born at 24 to \n\n25 weeks and over 90 percent born at 26 to 27 weeks survive31 \u2013 33. Between weeks 23rd and 24th of \n\ngestation, an average individual\u2019s chance for survival is augmented 3 to 4% per day. From 24 to 26 \n\nweeks of development, the increment in viability per day is reduced to 2 to 3%. The following \n\ngestational periods exhibit a decrease in rate of viability augmentation, due to the already present high \n\nchance of survival. \n\nThe GA at which the expectation that a foetus has as much chance of surviving as not surviving \n\npost-partum is a medical concept known as the limit of viability. With the development and support of \n\nneonatal intensive care units (NICU) \u2013 a special department of a hospital or health care facility \n\ncatering to ill or premature new-born babies \u2013 the limit of viability has been declining since half a \n\ncentury ago, although stagnant for the past 12 years34. The 50 percent survivability threshold is \n\ncurrently around the GA of 24 weeks35. \n\nFrom all possible factors that affect an infant\u2019s chance of survival, the most influential are age, \n\nweight, gender, and race. Foetal viability is also influenced by several types of health problems: \n\nbreathing problems, congenital abnormalities or malformations, and infections threaten the survival of \n\nthe neonate36. Other factors may influence the foetus\u2019 ability to withstand birth by altering the rate of \n\norgan maturation or oxygen supply. Progeny whose maternal entity is conditioned by diabetes \n\nmellitus, as an example, have a higher mortality rate (comparatively to non-diabetic mothers). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n4 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.1: Prenatal development.

WikiJournal of Medicine. 2014, 1 (2). \n\n \n\n2.2 Measurement Relevance \n\nTo analyse diagnoses and evaluate the recurrence risk for disadvantageous pregnancy conclusions, \n\nmedical and pathological professionals gather and disclose various anatomical details during neonatal \n\nautopsies. While questing for meaningful answers, numerous types of information play an important \n\npart; family and personal health history of the parents, obstetric events, biometrics, radiography, \n\nhistological examination, and laboratory studies, for example, are some of the paramount details \n\nrequired to produce any knowledge \u2013 and consequently, wisdom \u2013 in this field of work. For roughly \n\none third of cases, a precise cause of death may not be accurately determined despite all \n\ncomprehensive attempts performed37. Consequently, and due to lack of adequate explanation to family \n\nmembers for their affliction, socially-impaired mourning behaviours may rise38. Specialists aim to \n\nunearth distinct syndromic diagnoses as families are best supplied by having unambiguous acumen \n\ninto future liabilities. Without normative tables, presumptively important findings such as hypoplasia \u2013 \n\nthe underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue or organ \u2013 and hypertrophy \u2013 the \n\nincrease in the volume of an organ or tissue due to the enlargement of its component cells \u2013 for \n\nexample, may not be accurately denoted while clinically assessing an individual during any biometric \n\nprocedure. \n\nIn 2006, the conjoint effort of John Archie, Julianne Collins, and Robert Lebel produced \n\nquantitative standards for foetal and neonatal autopsies. The data used to create such a construct was \n\navailable at the time, sourcing from other information repositories which had been assembled by other \n\nresearchers. Singleton foetal measurements and their associated gestational periods derived from \n\nspecific circumstances: data was collected from different geographical origins39 \u2013 53 with varying \n\ngathering conditions; for example, normal term infants, electively aborted foetuses, and stillborn data \n\nwere utilized, acquired from contrasting regression analysis models \u2013 linear and polynomial. \n\nPortuguese professionals make use of this meta-analytical informational design daily to produce \n\nviable output from their gathered observations, providing overwhelming importance to the \n\ncontribution of John Archie and his team. CHLO medical specialists select specific measurements and \n\nweights from the list of all variables studied throughout the foetal developmental process, while \n\nassessing any foetopathological event. Preceding any diagnosis, professionals must associate each \n\nmeasurement to a specific gestational period in weeks, following a unified table of lengths, distances, \n\nand weights. Discrepancies between age values from different variables within the same individual \n\nprovide insight into determining a probable cause of death and/or factors most linked to fatality. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n5 \n\n \n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nFor this study, a database is no more than a safe-deposit space for data. It serves the purpose of \n\nbeing able to structurally accommodate data, rendering it as information. Concretely, Python code is \n\nrequired to create and interact with said construct. In this fashion, once structure is defined, all \n\nprocesses of data insertion and query must fall onto the responsibility of specific code scripts; this \n\nprovides a practical barrier against uncareful practices towards data. For example, while it possible to \n\neasily visualize data by means of a spreadsheet, the information itself is kept separate from the \n\nobservation-enabling file, thus not being directly possible to alter or delete any given values or \n\nstructure within the informational scheme itself. \n\n24 quantitative variables were selected to represent each foetal autopsy case. Retrieved according \n\nto autopsy protocol, the extensive list of recorded foetal parameters follows: GA, CHL, CRL, HC, \n\nchest circumference (CC), abdominal circumference (AC), FL, HL, middle finger length (MFL), \n\nintercommissural distance (ID), philtrum length (PL), inner canthal distance (ICD), outer canthal \n\ndistance (OCD), left palpebral fissure width (LPFW), right palpebral fissure width (RPFW), left ear \n\nlength (LEL), right ear length (REL), body, kidneys, thymus, spleen, liver, lungs, and adrenals. Paired \n\norgans are represented by their combined weight. Units comprise of week (GA), centimetre (distances \n\nand lengths), and gram (organ and body weights). \n\nGiven the format of each autopsy report file in this work, a database was constructed and \n\nalgorithms to store, retrieve, and manipulate information were devised. Python 2.7 was applied as the \n\nprogramming language for these tasks mainly due to its extensive libraries and packages, notably \n\nSQLite3 (providing SQL interface compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described in PEP \u2013 \n\nPython Enhancement Proposal \u2013 249), NumPy, and SciPy modules54 \u2013 56, while also prioritizing code \n\nreadability. Another Python-promoting key factor is that it facilitates script development by being \n\nmulti-paradigmatic, fully supporting aspect-oriented, object-oriented, structured, imperative, \n\nfunctional, contract, and logic styles of programming57 \u2013 63. IBM\u2019s SPSS software64 was also utilized \n\ndue to its inbuilt statistical applications, concretely PCA and variable selection algorithms for multiple \n\nlinear regression. \n\n \n\n3.1 Data Structure \n\nThe actual database structure utilized to store and retrieve information is a simplistic one. Despite \n\nbeing modelled as a relational database, no more than a single table was created due to the underlying \n\nnature of selected data. Within this specified database there exists a table where the first column \n\ncorresponds to an identifier for every individual (primary key), and each other column represents a \n\ncertain variable of interest. Hence, each row denotes a singleton foetal autopsy report, with its own \n\nidentity, and associated measures and weights. \n\nTo create a .db extension file using Python (createDB.py), it is firstly necessary to create a \n\nConnection object (herein referred to as conn) representing the database. Once conn is established, it is \n\nimperative to conceive a Cursor object (derived from conn\u2019s cursor() method) and make use of its \n\nexecute() method to perform SQL commands. Therefore, a command variable must be initialized with \n\na string attributed to it, representing the SQL-syntax statement for database creation. As a DB-API \n\n(database-application programming interface) requirement, after connecting to the database and thus \n\nensuing a new transaction, it is necessary to confirm any alterations made: the commit() method, \n\nbelonging to the conn object, applies such confirmations. During a database creation procedure, the \n\nreferenced method is not strictly necessary, but rather demonstrates good coding practice as it is \n\nrequired when inserting, deleting, or updating values within the database. Lastly, to terminate the \n\npreviously established connection, the close() method (belonging to conn) is evoked. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n6 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.1: Excerpt from createDB.py script file. Snippet of Python code used to produce the database. All variables are \n\ndeclared as FLOAT, except for idd (type VARCHAR) which is the primary key. Exemplary, only 2 variables are depicted. \n\nWhen run, outputs a dbName.db file consisting of a database with the specified table properties. \n\n \n\nA simple database structure should be accompanied by a straightforward data insertion mechanism. \n\nAll scribed reports had to be translated into the form of digital information. To achieve this, a Python \n\nscript was formulated (insertValues.py) to aid the exhausting task of allocating all data heretofore \n\ngathered into the specified database. When run, a user-accessible interface emerges, iteratively \n\nrequesting the recorded values of each variable within an autopsy log. While running the insertion \n\nscript, the names displayed for each variable are derived from the variable names given when creating \n\nthe database. After all fields are filled, the gathered information is automatically inserted into the \n\ndatabase, symbolizing a unique individual and its corresponding features. A SQLite3 module approach \n\nis used, in resemblance to the previously mentioned database creation script, to execute SQL-syntax \n\ncommands for data insertion. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.2: Example of insertValues.py script file instancing. Practical application of the devised algorithm for value \n\ninsertion. All numerical values are considered as floating point numbers when inserted into the database. In this case, the \n\n199th autopsy report from the year 2005 is displayed. Variable names prompted by the script are shown to the left, while user \n\ninput values are shown to the right. Noticeably, idd was selected as the primary key variable name instead of id; this decision \n\nwas made because ID was already utilized as the variable for processing intercommissural distance. \n\n \n\nOnce our database has been populated with all necessary information, it is possible to elaborate on \n\nthat information so that proper analysis can ensue. For this purpose, a third Python script (analysis.py) \n\nwas created not only to retrieve information from the database, but also produce meaningful output. \n\nThis output comes in two different forms. One type of output is merely a data frame containing data \n\n\n\n \n\n \n7 \n\n \n\n(for example, a .csv extension file). This output is then manually imported onto IBM\u2019s SPSS software \n\nthrough the Import Data option, for the application of exploratory and multiple regression analyses. \n\nThe second type of output consists of every other result enunciated within this thesis (polynomial \n\nregression and clustering, for example), described along this work, including SPSS output analysis. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3.3: Information workflow. Practical illustration of all tasks and items required within this work. Arrows indicate the \n\ndirection of information flow. P1 (createDB.py) creates the specified database (DB); P2 (insertValues.py) inserts all \n\ninformation retrieved from an AR (Autopsy Report) into DB; P3 (analysis.py), after retrieving data from the database, \n\noutputs a .csv file (O1) containing all DB information; O1 is manually passed onto IBM\u2019s SPSS software (SP), which outputs \n\nits analysis results (O2); O2 is manually incorporated onto P3, which outputs the end results (O3) shown in this dissertation. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n8 \n\n \n\n3.2 Data Exploration and Model Comparison \n\nSPSS was used to conduct the initial PCA, which would provide foresight onto possible outcomes \n\nof successive regression models. Computed extraction communalities, loadings, explained variance \n\nper component, and adequacy parameters were consequently inspected. Computation of multiple \n\nlinear regression models was performed through the same IBM software. GA was selected as the \n\ndependent variable, while the remaining 23 features were used as predictors. All available regression \n\nalgorithms for variable selection (Enter, Stepwise, Remove, Backward, and Forward) were utilized \n\nand their outputs taken into consideration. Models were selected based on statistically significant \n\ncoefficient values (? = 0.05), as well as Durbin-Watson and R2 values. Standardized ?-weights were \n\nalso a point of interest for later model comparison. \n\nIn total, 5 different kth degree polynomial regression functions were fit onto each of the 23 \n\nvariables, for k ? {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Each variable dataset consisted of pairs of variable-age points, where \n\neach pair represents the GA and recorded variable value of a singleton foetus. The NumPy module \n\npolyfit() function was used to output each single variable model. R2 and estimated parameter values \n\nwere recorded for all regressions presenting a significant p-value for the null hypothesis that the \n\nestimated coefficients are equal to zero. \n\nRegression models were compared based on each model\u2019s proportion of variance in the dependent \n\nvariable predictable by the independent variable. The F-statistic was selected and computed using the \n\nsquared sum of residuals (SSR) and degrees of freedom of the models being compared65. A \n\nsignificance level of ? = 0.05 was established. Each multiple linear regression model was compared to \n\nall other multiple and polynomial models, while polynomial models were compared to other \n\npolynomial models if and only if both models pertained to the same polynomial degree. When \n\ncomparing 2 models with the same degree of freedom, the F-statistic was computed as \n\n \n\n? =  \n???1\n\n???2\n \n\n \n\nwhere SSR1 and SSR2 indicate the squared sum of residuals for each model being compared. The \n\nupper critical value of the F distribution was then deduced with both numerator and denominator \n\nvalues equal to the degrees of freedom of either model. In contrast, to compare models exhibiting \n\ndifferent degrees of freedom (polynomial versus multiple regressions), the F-statistic was computed as \n\n \n\n? =  \n(???1 ? ???2) (??1 ? ??2)?\n\n(???2 ??2? )\n \n\n \n\nwhere df1 and df2 represent the degrees of freedom of the first and second models, respectively. The \n\nfirst model must be the one with fewer parameters between the 2 models being compared. The upper \n\ncritical value of the F distribution (which is directly related to the computed p-value) is deduced for a \n\nnumerator value of the difference between df1 and df2, and a denominator value of df2. \n\nThe SciPy module stats.f.cdf() function was used to compute all p-values associated with the \n\npreviously computed F-statistics. For models with the same degrees of freedom between them, \n\n \n\np-value =  1 ?  stats.f.cdf(?, ??1, ??2) \n \n\nwhile for models with different degrees of freedom between them, \n\n \n\np-value =  1 ?  stats.f.cdf(?, ??1 ? ??2, ??2) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n9 \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\n4.1 Principal Component Analysis \n\nFor our dataset, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index for sampling adequacy had a value of 0.973 \n\nwhile the p-value corresponding to the ?2-statistic associated with Bartlett\u2019s test of homoscedasticity \n\nwas below 5x10-4. PCA produced only one significant component (eigenvalue ? 1) explaining \n\n79.624% of total data variance.

Without statistical significance of correlations, the remaining outputs of PCA \n\n(components, communalities, and loadings, for instance) would be statistically invalid. The KMO \n\nindex (values ranging from 0 to 1), once correlation significance has been inferred, indicates how \n\nefficiently our original variables can be factorized, given that the correlation between any 2 variables \n\ncan be influenced by any other given variable present within the dataset. A sphericity test significance \n\nvalue lower than 5x10-4, and a KMO index of 0.973 indicate that our dataset is viable for a PCA \n\napproach. Having a total of 24 variables and a dataset comprised of 450 individuals helped stipulate \n\nwhich component retention criterion to be used66. For this reason, a single component was selected \n\nwith a corresponding eigenvalue of 19.1. This component exhibited a percentage of total variance \n\nexplained of 79.62, which is adequate67. The total amount of variance shared between each variable \n\nand every other parameter within our analysis (communality) presented higher values for variables \n\nsuch as CRL, CHL, and FL (order from highest to lowest). On a similar note, for our retained principal \n\ncomponent (which can be described as a developmental marker), loading values have the same \n\nvariable-value order (as in the communalities table), which translates into the correlation between the \n\noriginal variables and that component. For variables yielding high loading values (CRL, CHL, FL, for \n\nexample), one can assume those variables might be considered as potentially good developmental \n\nmarkers (or rather, reliable GA predictors). Such claims, however, can only be induced by different \n\nmethods, such as regression analysis. \n\nAn important step in regression model validation is testing the hypothesis that the squared sum of \n\nresiduals in a model is significantly different than the SSR of a constant-valued model. Every \n\nregression model (both multiple and polynomial) presented, in accordance with the associated test \n\nstatistic, statistically significant R2 values (p-value ? 0.05). Given the high correlation values between \n\nseveral variables (as foetal development acts positively on all measurements and weights), and to filter \n\npossible GA estimation candidates, variable selection algorithms were used to produce multiple linear \n\nregressions. For a significance level ? = 0.05, the least possible number of features presenting \n\nsignificantly distinguishable effects were selected by each of the 2 algorithms (Stepwise and Forward). \n\nBecause these algorithms are based on variable iteration, autocorrelation is factor to be taken into \n\nconsideration. Durbin-Watson (DW) test values (where the null hypothesis assumes that model errors \n\nare serially uncorrelated against the alternative that they follow a first order autoregressive process) \n\nwere inspected for model validation. With an optimal value of 2, both output models presented reliable \n\nDurbin-Watson values (2 \u2013 abs(DW) ? 0.042). In SPSS, the Stepwise algorithm incorporates both F-in \n\nand F-out (F-statistic critical values for considering variables as having significantly distinguishable \n\neffects or not) parameters used in Backward (starting from a full set of variables and iteratively \n\nremoving each variable) and Forward (beginning from a single variable and iteratively inserting each \n\nvariable) variable selection methods, respectively. Hence, Stepwise and Backward algorithms \n\nproduced multiple linear regression models with identical retained variables and their associated ?-\n\nweights, and coefficient of determination values (R2 ? 0.953), varying only in DW values. Because \n\nBackward/Stepwise and Forward approaches have different computational starting points and \n\ndirection (empty versus full set of variables), variables CHL and CRL (which have statistically \n\nindistinguishable effects) were retained, respectively. This is understandable when taking into \n\nconsideration the correlation value between the 2 variables (0.992) and the nature of the measured \n\nparameters. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n19 \n\n \n\nWhen comparing both models in terms of R2, there was no statistical evidence supporting the \n\nhypothesis that the squared sum of residuals of models varied significantly. Excluding that variable \n\npair, both models retained the same remaining significant variables: Body, FL, CHL/CRL, REL, \n\nLungs, and Adrenals (in descending standardized ?-weight order for both models, albeit having \n\ndifferent ? values for the same variable). Standardized ?-weight values indicate which previously \n\nvalidated variables (presenting statistical significance) contribute the most within a multiple linear \n\nregression model. Lungs and Adrenals, although selected by each algorithm, have small contribution \n\nvalues (abs(?) ? 0.1), for example. A ranking system based on weights can be interpreted, denoting \n\nbody weight (? ? 0.393), FL (? ? 0.347), and CHL (? ? 0.266), CRL (? ? 0.199), and REL (? ? 0.16) \n\nas major contributors for GA estimation, following a linear combination approach. This mustn\u2019t mean, \n\nhowever, that a certain variable is better than another variable, individually, at GA estimation. To \n\ncompare variables individually, single variable-GA pairs are used to compute polynomial regression \n\nmodels. \n\nR2 values increased, for each of the 23 variable-derived models, along all ordered kth degree \n\npolynomial regression models, for k ? {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Polynomial models with higher values of k are \n\nmore likely to be subjected to overfitting; should k tend to an infinitely large value, then the training \n\nerror would approach 0 (R2 would approach 1). Due to the nature of our dataset, cross validation \n\n(which would account for cases of overfitting) could not be executed, as the division of data would \n\nproduce datasets with missing representative GA values. For this reason, variable models were only \n\ncompared to other variable models for the same polynomial degree k. The concept of overfitting was \n\nalso taken into consideration while assessing our results. Inspecting the results of residual comparison \n\ntesting for a significance level ? = 0.05, several clusters and meta-clusters (groups of clusters \n\nbranching outward in figures 4.2 through 4.6) are distinguishable. Cluster hierarchy for models where \n\nk = 1, simple linear regression, presented a significantly different variable order when compared to all \n\nother kth degree models. The cluster of variables with the highest coefficient of determination values \u2013 \n\nCRL, CHL, and FL with 0.927 ? R2 ? 0.931 \u2013 exhibits significantly fewer error comparatively to the \n\nmeta-cluster comprised of variables OCD, AC, MFL, Body, LEL, REL, and HC, for example. This top \n\ntier cluster does not, however, discern which of the 3 foetal parameters is statistically superior (p-value \n\n? 0.05) to serve as the best possible GA estimator. Clusters, thus, indicate the hierarchy by which \n\nfoetal parameters are selected as developmental predictors. For k ? 2, body weight is incorporated into \n\nthe cluster or meta-cluster of variables with highest R2. \n\nOther significant changes between k equal to 1 and k ? 2 can be witnessed with variables models \n\nbased on HL and CC. When k = 2, both models are placed within the meta-cluster of 2nd hierarchical \n\nposition. The latter model, for any k ? 2, always stands within the meta-cluster of 2nd hierarchical \n\nposition; however, the model derived from HL measurements, throughout 3 ? k ? 5, is positioned \n\nwithin the meta-cluster (for k = 3, and k = 4) or cluster (k = 5) of variables with higher estimation \n\ncapabilities. Absolute R2 values for every variable regression model, excluding Body, HL, CC, and ID \n\nkept their relative position across different polynomial degrees. The regression model based on ID, \n\ndespite rising in hierarchy throughout ordered values of k, was never witnessed within any cluster or \n\nmeta-cluster of rank 2 or superior. The changes in hierarchy configuration are understandable when \n\ncomparing linear (k = 1) to non-linear (k ? 2) regression models. Body weight, as a predictive variable \n\nfor GA estimation, fits a quadratic function better than a linear one, for example. Such is the nature of \n\nthat variable, and overfitting can be excluded. However, the same might not be said regarding HL and \n\nits hierarchical position variations across k. It is only when k = 5 that this model is present within the \n\nunique cluster of most appropriate GA estimator variables (highest R2 values). The process of \n\noverfitting by k increment may be at play, for this variable. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n20 \n\n \n\n5.1 Final Remarks \n\nIn our case of 450 foetal autopsy cases, findings suggest that across all variables, CHL, CRL, and \n\nFL are the most appropriate candidate foetal parameters for GA estimation. Within all approaches \n\n(PCA and regression techniques), certain specific variables showed a tendency to present values \n\nindicative of superior estimation capabilities (either by correlation or by SSR, for instance). CRL, \n\nCHL, and FL are the only variables possessing this property. Other variables can also be considered as \n\nproper developmental markers, depending on the technique utilized. For any degree of polynomial \n\nregression, these variables were always displayed within the significantly highest R2 cluster. The same \n\nvariables were also selected by multiple linear regression, exhibiting positive standardized ?-weights ? \n\n0.199 (ascendingly ordered CRL, CHL, and FL), and presented the highest PCA communality and \n\nloading values. Body weight, HC, HL, and ear length are also noteworthy candidate variables for \n\neither presenting high PCA communality and loading values, or having significantly meaningful ? \n\nand/or R2 values.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n21 \n\n \n\nChapter 6 \n\n \n\nConclusion \n\nAccurately estimating foetal GA is essential for pregnancy management. As a further matter, GA \n\nestimation during autopsy procedures is key in assessing legal and criminal abortion cases. During \n\nthese events, the estimation of GA depends on the foetal parameters used. Measurements of various \n\nfoetal anthropometric features are frequently used for this purpose. \n\nThe primary goal for this thesis of devising a simple method for storing and manipulating \n\ninformation (regarding the foetal autopsy report files pertaining to Hospital de Egas Moniz) was \n\nachieved. This was made possible by developing a Python application which enabled the creation of \n\nan information system, integrating a computer-assisted data insertion tool (createDB.py and \n\ninsertValues.py files, respectively). Moreover, by applying different algorithmic approaches to our \n\ncollection of structured data (such as the previously discussed PCA and polynomial/multiple \n\nregression techniques), we produced statistically meaningful results directly enabling a better \n\nunderstanding of the real-world problem of GA assessment or estimation. We also established a novel \n\napproach to determine measurement adequacy, through the course of this work, by associating our \n\ncomputed regression models to statistical hypothesis test for divergence in variance (F-statistic on \n\nsquared sum of residuals, conclusively). This new solid and well-founded variable clustering approach \n\nis one of our many contributions formulated during this thesis, which we hope will assist \n\nfoetopathologists everywhere during their medical procedures. \n\nConsistent with previously published work, CHL, CRL, and FL are found to be the most reliable \n\nsources of information for estimating foetal developmental age. Particularly in cases of 1st degree \n\npolynomial regression models, clustering algorithms based on R2 values placed exactly those 3 \n\nvariables in the top tier cluster of best GA estimators. These same variables were also witnessed \n\nwithin the cluster of best development predictors for any other kth degree polynomial regression \n\nmodel, albeit being accompanied by other variables (such as body weight for k ? 2 and HL for k ? 3); \n\nCHL, CRL, and FL were also retained in multiple linear regression models (with high ?-weight \n\nvalues, second only to Body and closely followed by REL), derived from variable selection algorithms \n\nbased on the statistical distinguishability of variable effects. In cases where these 3 preferable \n\nmeasurements are impossible to obtain, other foetal features can be utilized (albeit less reliable, as our \n\nfindings suggest) such as HL, HC, body weight, and ear length. \n\n \n\n6.1 Future Work \n\nAfter having validated the usability and adequacy of our methodology, it is feasible to assume that \n\nprogressive endeavours related to our data and methods can ensue; specifically, in the field of \n\nbiomedical and health sciences. By making use of open linked data \u2013 a previously validated method68 \n\nof publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and become more useful through semantic \n\nqueries \u2013, it is possible to cross validate, counter-examine, and derive additional knowledge (to name a \n\nfew practical applications) from our own findings deduced from this work. In this manner, it is \n\npossible to provide continuity to our studies not only in temporal terms but also in knowledge-\n\ngathering and, consequently, wisdom acquirement. \n\nAs our database evolves, and different foetal parameters are recorded, different studies can emerge. \n\nBy analysing features such as cause of death and family background, in association with \n\nmeasurements and weights, machine learning algorithms (such as neural networks, for instance) can \n\nbe executed to create a pathological prediction tool. Having a chronological set of the same parameters \n\nalong a pregnancy events may also help determine certain developmental particularities associated to \n\nillness and pregnancy abnormalities. These approaches would be useful for early diagnosis of disease, \n\naiding professionals and family members in taking the appropriate set of actions accordingly. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n22 \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n1.
