Whereas it is commonly known that, an \n\nincrease oil price has a good financial impact on alternative energy stock prices, the \n\nworks that analyzes the alternative energy risk factors are scarce. \n\n This thesis analyzes the risk factors of investing in alternative energies, using \n\nfor this purpose, a four variable regression where the factors are oil prices, technology \n\nstock prices, S&amp;P 500 and interest rates.   Due to their growing importance in markets, \n\nit is of interest of investors, managers and policy makers to know the risks of this kind \n\nof investments. The correlation matrix show that clean energy companies are more \n\ninfluenced by technology companies returns than with oil prices movements. The \n\nregression analysis show that oil prices, technology stock prices, risk free rate and the \n\nS&amp;P 500 have some relative strength in explaining clean energy stock price movements. \n\nIn addition, it also demonstrates that technology stock price movements are more \n\nimportant to explain alternative energy stock price movements than oil price movements \n\nbecause investors may see alternative energy companies similar to technology \n\ncompanies. \n\n \n\nJEL Classification: Q42, Q43. \n\nKey Words: Clean Energy, Stock Prices, Oil prices, Risk Factors. \n\n  \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\nIV \n \n\nResumo \n\n Preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais juntamente com a crescente import\u00e2ncia das energias \n\nalternativas na economia mundial est\u00e3o a mudar os h\u00e1bitos de consumo energ\u00e9ticos do \n\npetr\u00f3leo, em dire\u00e7\u00e3o a fontes mais ecol\u00f3gicas.

Introduction \n \n\n\u201cThe Administration is committed to a comprehensive energy strategy that \n\nsupports economic and job growth, bolsters energy security, positions the US to lead \n\nthe world in clean energy, and addresses the global challenge of climate change\u201d \n\nEconomic Report of the President (2013). \n\nThe importance of alternative energies is expected to continue to increase in the \n\ncoming years, due mainly to environmental concerns and energy security issues. \n\nTherefore, the importance of this sector in the global economy is expected to grow and \n\nmore firms have been appearing along the years. Thus it is of interest of investors to \n\nknow the risks of investing in alternative energy firms. \n\n The aim of this thesis is to analyze the risk factors of \n\nalternative energy stocks, being oil prices, technology stock prices and interest rates the \n\nmajor risk factors. Oil price movements help to explain alternative energy stock \n\nmovements because it is, first of all, an important substitute where rising oil prices \n\nincrease alternative energy demand (Henriques and Sadorski, 2008). Furthermore, the \n\nsame paper suggest that stock prices of alternative energy companies are more \n\ninfluenced by shocks in technology stock prices than by oil prices movements. Kumar  \n\net al. (2012) extend Henriques and Sadorsky (2008), and state that investors see clean \n\nenergy firms as technology firms, although Managi (2013) results, contradict it. He \n\nshows that after structural breaks, there is a positive relationship between oil prices and \n\nclean energy prices, which reveal a different view, whereas Henriques and Sadorsky \n\n(2008) and Kumar et al. (2012) show that alternative energy companies are more \n\ninfluenced by shocks in technology stock prices than oil price movements and that \n\nalternative energy firms are seen by investors as technology firms, Managi (2013) states \n\nthat before structural breaks the results are consistent with them, however, after \n\nstructural breaks there is a positive relationship between oil prices and clean energy \n\nprices. \n\nThe purpose of this paper is, thus, to shed some light on this issue in order to \n\nknow the risks of this kind of investments. \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nTo better understand the aforementioned relations, it is fundamental to begin this \n\nstudy by analyzing the energy consumption worldwide. \n\nOil is the major driver of the world economy, it affects all industries thus every \n\nactivity relies on it and it is as well, the most traded commodity, as it can be seen in \n\nFigure 1. Crude oil alone accounts for 15%, which represents the commodity with the \n\ngreatest importance, followed by Gold (11.5%), Natural Gas (9.4%) and Copper (7.5%). \n\nIn the other hand, Nickel (2.0%), Lean Hogs (1.9%) and Cotton (1.6%) are the ones \n\nwith the smallest relevance when comparing with the other commodities. The US is the \n\nbiggest crude oil importer according to Key World Energy Statistics (2013). \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Dow Jones UBS commodity Index Composition \n\n \n\nThe World oil demand in 2013 represents a growth of 1% or 0.82 mb/d  \n\ncompared to the previous year and forecasts for 2014 indicate that it is expected to \n\nincrease by 1 mb/d or 1.2%. However, the OECD consumption is expected to continue \n\nto decline at rate of 0.2 mb/d (OPEC October 2013). On the other hand, compared to the \n\nglobal spectrum of the energy, as Figure 2 demonstrates, oil consumption has been \n\nF i g u r e   1   \u2013   C o m p o s i t i o n   o f   t h e   D o w   J o n e s   U B S   c o m m o d i t y   I n d e x   \n\n  \n\nS o u r c e :   http://www.eia.gov/finance/markets/financial_markets.cfm     \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\ndecreasing, which represents a change towards alternative energies. Analyzing the year \n\nof 1973 and 2011 in regard to the world consumption, we can see a positive evolution in \n\nthe alternative energies it evolves from 1.6% in 1973 to 3.4% in 2011 and a decrease in \n\noil from 48.1% to 40.8%, respectively, despite the fact that in global terms the energy \n\nconsumption has increased from 4674 to 8918 Mtoe in 2011 (Key World Energy \n\nStatistics 2013).  \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Total Energy Consumption from 1973 to 2011 \n\nSource : Key World Energy Statistics \n\nRegarding the commercial stock movements, results for August 2013 show that \n\nOECD commercial oil stocks decreased by 10.4 mb, where it reached a 68 mb below \n\nthe five-year average and presented a 53 mb less than the previous year. On the other \n\nhand, the results about the same period demonstrate that US commercial oil stocks \n\nincreased by 4.5 mb and inventories stood at 2.4 mb or 0.2% above the year before and \n\nshowed a gain of 33 mb or 3% over the five-year average (OPEC October 2013). \n\nWhile energy consumption is increasing, as it can be seen in Figure 2, it is \n\ncrucial that other sources of energy are used, namely clean or alternative energies such \n\nas solar, wind, geothermal, heat between others, in order to limit climate changes and so \n\nembrace the sustainable development.  In the US, several policies and measures have \n\nbeen implemented such as market-based solution to climate change, which provide \n\neconomic incentives to those who pollute less, so that the cost of polluting reflects the \n\neconomic harm caused to others. Cap-and-trade system and Clean Energy Standard are \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nexamples of market-based solutions presented in the Economic Report of the President \n\n(2013).  \n\nAccording to IPCC 2013, human influence on the climate is clear, raising \n\ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, forcing positive radioactive and \n\nglobal warming. In addition, the report also states that in order to limit the climate \n\nchanges it would be necessary to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions, because the \n\ncontinued emissions will cause further warming and changes to the climate system. So, \n\nit is fundamental not only, to further develop the alternative energies, but as well to \n\nreduce the human footprint on the environment, in order to build a greener society.  \n\nAfter motivating this topic and explaining what issues are expected to be \n\ncovered it is time to do a brief overview over the sample period about what happened in \n\nthe world economy but more precisely in the US, followed by market analysis, review \n\nliterature, data and empirical analysis. The final chapter of the thesis presents the major \n\nconclusions. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n2. Overview of the sample period- The new century \n \n\nThis chapter of the thesis intends to study some of the events of the sample period, \n\nfrom the year of 2001 until 2013, subdivided in three sub periods, which happened in \n\nthe US, in order to examine the relationships among the variables under the scope of \n\nthis paper. \n\n \n\nFigure 3 provides a good picture regarding the way on these assets have developed \n\nsince the beginning of 2001 until 2013. As the graphic illustrates, Crude Oil (West \n\nTexas Intermediate) is the green line and the Clean Energy Index is represented by \n\nWilderHill in orange. As it can be seen in 2001/2002 the Clean Energy Index suffered a \n\ngreat loss, whereas Crude Oil did not present a big variation, afterwards, both assets \n\nmaintained a constant grow, prior to the global financial crisis, even reaching both \n\nassets peaking values, considering this sample period, suffering after it major hits. \n\nFollowing the losses caused by the crisis in 2007/2008 in the darker area, both assets \n\nkept constant values until the crude oil passes the clean energy index reverting the initial \n\nsituation, until current days. In Figure 3 it seems that both assets follow a similar path, \n\nbefore the financial crisis and although the oil price had reached higher values after \n\nWilderHill, it appears that it suffered in the same way as clean energies. Contrasting \n\nwith clean energies, which had decreased even more, the price of oil started to recover \n\nin 2009. \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Crude Oil and Clean Energy Index Prices Evolution \n\n \n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n2.1 2001-2002 - The end of the recession and the terrorist \n\nattacks \n \n\nThe subperiod among 2001-2002 had two major events that caused a significant \n\ndecline in financial markets, two distinct situations that combined aggravate even more \n\nthe recession that was already in place. The so-called Dot-com bubble and the Terrorist \n\nattacks of 9/11. \n\nIn order to analyze this subperiod is necessary to go a couple of years back. In \n\nthe year of 1999, there was an economic boom regarding technology companies, namely \n\ncomputer and software sales, induced by the Y2K fright, the bug of the millennium. In \n\norder to prevent this issue, many companies and individuals bought new software \n\nsystems, which induced the stock prices of high technology companies to increase. As a \n\nresult, a lot of investors invested in high technology companies, whether they are \n\nprofitable or not. \n\nIn 2000, as companies and individuals had bought all the necessary computer \n\nequipment, computer orders had declined which led ultimately to a stock-market sell-\n\noff. As stock prices declined many high technology companies went bankrupt\n1\n.As a \n\nconsequence, the Nasdaq Composite, where most high technology company stocks are \n\ntraded, lost 78% (percentage lost from peak to bottom) of its value as it fell from \n\n5046.86 to 1114.11\n2\n. As it can be seen in the Figure 4, the Nasdaq suffered a great \n\nevolution, from less than 1000 points in 1995 to its highest value in 2000 of more than \n\n4500 points. After it, the bubble burst and then, Nasdaq decreased to a little more than \n\n1000 points in 2002. From 2002 until 2009, Nasdaq was having a constant growth when \n\nin 2008, with the global financial crisis as it is better explained afterwards, decreased \n\nagain from 2500 to 1500 points. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                             \n1\n http://useconomy.about.com/od/grossdomesticproduct/a/cause_recession.htm \n\n2\n http://www.investopedia.com/features/crashes/crashes8.asp \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n \n\nRegarding the terrorist attacks, which happened on 11th of September of 2001, \n\nthey had several implications, both short and long-term economic impacts, which led \n\nthe Dow Jones to decrease more than 600 points, the 2001 recession to aggravate and \n\nhad initiated the War on Terrorism. As stated before, the terrorist attacks worsened the \n\n2001 recession, the economy had contracted in the first quarter and however the second \n\nquarter had described an economy growth, the attacks had extended the recession with a \n\nnew economy contraction\n3\n. \n\nFurthermore, one of the measures undertaken was to kept NYSE and the Nasdaq \n\nclosed until the 17\nth\n\n of September to try to avoid panic selling and a huge loss in the \n\nmarkets, it was the longest shutdown since 1933. On the first trading day of NYSE after \n\n9/11, it set a record for the great loss in one day in exchange history, the market fell 684 \n\npoints, which represented a 7.1% loss. By the end of that week, with the biggest losses \n\nin NYSE history, the Dow Jones had felt for almost of 1370 points, which translates in a \n\nloss over 14%. Regarding the other US index, the S&amp;P lost 11.6%, a $1.4 trillion in \n\nvalue in a week. The most affected sectors were the airlines and insurance companies \n\nwhere American Airlines and United Airlines suffered the hardest hit, the first one \n\ndropped from a $29.70 per share on September 11\nth\n to $18.00 per share September 17th, \n\n                                                             \n3\n http://useconomy.about.com/od/Financial-Crisis/f/911-Attacks-Economic-Impact.htm \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Nasdaq Evolution between 1995 and 2010 \n\n \n\nSource: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8558257.stm  \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\na 39% decline, whereas the latter dropped from $30.82 to $17.50 representing a 42% \n\ndecrease. Considering the financial services, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley \n\nsuffered the greatest losses, 11.5% and 13%, respectively. \n\nIn the other hand, there were some sectors which increased value, for instance, \n\nsome technology, defense, weaponry, communications and pharmaceutical companies \n\nsaw share prices grow due to an increase in government business as the country \n\nprepared for war\n4\n. \n\nAccording to Kliesen, the 2001 recession and its recovery was unique in some \n\naspects. Firstly, it had a relatively short duration, when compared to other recessions. \n\nSecondly, in a usual recession, the spending on durable goods and real estate decrease, \n\nbut this was not the situation, it kept increasing during the recession.  \n\nAfter covered the period among 2001-2002 it is time to study what happened \n\nbetween the following subsample period, 2003-2007. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                             \n4\n http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0911/how-september-11-affected-the-u.s.-stock-\n\nmarket.aspx \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n2.2 2003-2007 \u2013 Sub-prime crisis and the housing market \n\nbubble \n \n\nFollowing the technology bubble and the events happened on 11\nth\n September of \n\n2001, the Fed, in the US, cut the interest rates to an extremely low level, in order to \n\nstimulate the economy. This measure was the beginning, ironically, to a new crisis. \n\nPeople who usually could not afford loans, because of the poor credit rating, were able \n\nto access it through the sub-prime lending, when non-traditional mortgages were \n\ncreated, interest-only loans and mortgages with extended amortization periods, for \n\nexample. Interest rates ended up climbed back up and many borrowers defaulted when \n\ntheir mortgages were reset to much higher monthly payments. This left mortgage \n\nlenders with property that was worth less than the loan value due to a weakening \n\nhousing market. Defaults increased; the problem snowballed, and several lenders went \n\nbankrupt\n5\n. \n\nThe consequences regarding the financial markets were originated mostly due to a \n\nfundamental change in the way mortgages markets work. Normally, banks financed \n\ntheir mortgage lending with deposits received from customers, which had limited the \n\namount of lending they could do. However, the change made to the traditional model \n\nallowed banks to fund additional borrowing in a much easier way: they sold the \n\nmortgages to the bond markets which led to abuses as banks no longer have the \n\nincentive to check carefully the mortgages they issue\n6\n. In other words, lenders sold \n\nmortgages they originated into the secondary market, where they were sold together as \n\nCDOs and other MBSs. \n\nIn the year of 2005, sub-prime lending had spread across America. By then, one of \n\nfive mortgages were sub-prime, they were particularly popular among recent \n\nimmigrants, or in other terms, families that did not qualify for ordinary home loans who \n\nwere looking for a home for the first time in the US and because of the high prices it \n\nwas difficult to buy one without moving to the suburbs. The evolution between the 2003 \n\nand 2006 of below-investment MBSs is shown in the Table 1 and as it can be seen, the \n\nsubprime lending was the one with the bigger increase, from 37.4 (34% ) in 2003 to \n\n                                                             \n5\n http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/subprime-meltdown.asp \n\n6\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7073131.stm \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n114.3 Million Dollars (44%). The main problem with the sub-prime mortgages was the \n\npayments, which were fixed for two years and then become dependent on the level of \n\nFed interest rates, which many of them increased in the next two years, leading to a \n\nmuch higher rate of repossession by the banks than other mortgages. Furthermore, the \n\nmany repossessions made by banks had one major impact, the reverse evolution of \n\nhouses prices, which force the property owners to lower the prices, in order to try to sell \n\nthe remain properties, or in other terms, the repossessions caused the first house prices \n\ndecline since the decade of 30s\n7\n. \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Mortgage Evolution between 2003 and 2006 \n\n \n\nSource : http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2007/12/dodd.htm  \n\nAs a conclusion of this sub-sample period, during the sharp growth of the sub-prime \n\nmarket among 2001 and 2006, the quality of loans had become worse and the \n\nunderwriting criteria wider; the fact that house prices had appreciated between 2003 and \n\n2005 disguised the real risk of sub-prime mortgages which was underestimated by \n\nrating agencies and finally the unsustainable growth of the sub-prime market led to its \n\ncollapse (Demyanyk and Van Hemert 2009).  \n\nThe sub-prime crisis, as well as the housing prices crash or downturn, had several \n\nimplications on the global financial crisis as it is explained hereafter. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n7\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7073131.stm \n\nhttp://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2007/12/dodd.htm\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n2.3 2008-2013 \u2013 Global Financial Crisis up to today \n \n\nThe time period from 2008 to 2013, represents a global financial crisis that is so far, \n\nthe worst crisis since the great depression of 1930s. This crisis had several \n\nconsequences such as, the deterioration of most financial markets around the world, \n\ncontributed to a potential collapse of major financial institutions worldwide and it \n\ninvolved national governments in bailing out too?big?to?fail banks (SIFIs). During this \n\ntime period more was affected besides financial markets and its institutions, in \n\nparticular, the house market and real estate prices at a global level, the unemployment \n\nand the long-term unemployment rates increased, the consumer wealth and its \n\nexpenditures decreased over this period and ultimately, this crisis contributed to the \n\nEuropean sovereign-debt crisis (Causes and Consequences of the 2008 Global \n\nFinancial Crisis by Vodenska, Boston University). \n\nIn Figure 5 are represented the evolution of five variables, Crude Oil, WilderHill, \n\nArca Tech 100, 3 month Treasury Bill Interest Rate, S&amp;P 500 from 2008 to 2013. In \n\nthis Figure it can be seen when the global financial crisis took place (the darker grey in \n\nthe Figure), all variables suffered a loss, being the S&amp;P 500 and the Arca Tech 100 the \n\nones that suffered the major losses. After it in the following years, the S&amp;P 500 and the \n\nArca Tech 100 had a great recovery ended in the 2013 with superior values than the \n\nones when the crisis hit, whilst the Crude Oil, the WilderHill and the 3 month Treasury \n\nBill Interest Rate kept constant values after the crisis, being the 3 month interest rate the \n\none with the lowest values during the entire subperiod. According to some papers, \n\nnamely Managi (2013),he shows that after structural breaks, the financial crisis, there is \n\na positive relationship between oil prices and clean energy prices, which is what can be \n\nseen in Figure 5, where both have approximately the same values. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Crude Oil, WilderHill, Arca Tech 100, 3 month Treas Bill Int Rate and S&amp;P 500 \n\nEvolution from 2008 to 2013 \n\n \n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream \n\nThe financial crisis of 2008 can be defined as the worst recession since the great \n\ndepression of 1929, where house prices fell 31.8% and unemployment continue to be \n\nabove the rate of 9% two years after the recession\n8\n.  \n\nThe first evidence that was something wrong with the economy appeared in 2006, \n\nwhen the house prices started to downturn, as mentioned before. In addition, there was a \n\nchain of reactions, after the house market downturn, in the financial system. \n\nFurthermore, the financial instruments supposedly without risk turn out to be worthless, \n\nnamely MBSs and CDOs even with the approval of the rating agencies\n9\n. \n\nAccording to Causes and Consequences of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis by \n\nVodenska, Boston University, the number of failed banks in the US between 2000 and \n\n2013 was 497, 27 from the year of 2000 to 2007 and 470 from 2008 until 2013, which \n\ncan reveal what happened to the financial system during the last years. In addition, \n\nVodenska also states several reasons for Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, namely, the high \n\nlevel of leverage, which increased from 2003 to 2008, the heavy investments made in \n\nthe real estate market and the large positions taken in the sub-prime market as well as \n\n                                                             \n8\n http://useconomy.about.com/od/criticalssues/f/What-Is-the-Global-Financial-Crisis-of-2008.htm \n\n9\n http://www.economist.com/news/schoolsbrief/21584534-effects-financial-crisis-are-still-being-felt-five-\n\nyears-article \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nother lower-rated mortgages, which ended up with Lehman Brothers declaring \n\nbankruptcy on September 2013. \n\nAccording to the article The origins of the financial crisis by The Economist, one of \n\nthe most dramatic errors made during the crisis was to let Lehman Brothers to go \n\nbankrupt, which had multiplied the panic in the markets leading to a real problem in the \n\neconomy, where non-financial companies were unable to borrow money from banks, \n\nthus making the companies powerless to fulfill its payment obligations, namely to \n\nsuppliers or even workers. \n\nIn 2008 the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the US lost 33.8% of its value and by \n\nthe end of the year, since the economic systems had become more globally \n\ninterconnected, the recession had spread to most of the World\n10\n\n. The situation \n\ndeteriorated during the summer of 2008, where the Treasury Department was allowed to \n\nspent up to $150 billion to subsidize and eventually take over Fannie Mae and Freddie \n\nMac, the two most important mortgage companies, and regarding the AIG (American \n\nInternational Group), an insurance company that faced its most delicate financial \n\nsituation in 2008, due to the sold credit protection that ultimately had decrease in value, \n\nthe Fed used $150 billion to bail it out.  \n\nOn September, because of the lack of trust on other financial instruments, \n\nbusinesses moved record $140 billion into even safer Treasury bonds. Meanwhile, the \n\nTreasury Secretary Henry Paulson along with Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, proposed a \n\nproposed a $700 billion bailout package, although only $350 billion was used in 2008 to \n\nbuy bank and automotive company stocks, in order to try to stimulate these industries. \n\nOne of the measures done by the Treasury Secretary in order to establish and manage of \n\na treasury fund, TARP, that was created in October 2008, which objectives were to \n\nbought stocks in eight banks: Bank of New York Mellon, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, \n\nMorgan Stanley, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and State \n\nStreet. Moreover, TARP funds were used to buy other company stocks namely: AIG \n\n($40 billion), Community banks ($92 billion), Big 3 auto companies ($24.8 billion), \n\nCitigroup and Bank of America ($45 billion)\n11\n\n. In the year of 2010, banks had already \n\n                                                             \n10\n\n http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1484264/The-Financial-Crisis-of-2008-Year-In-Review-\n\n2008 \n11\n\n http://useconomy.about.com/od/glossary/g/TARP.htm \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\npaid back $194 of the TARP fund. The remaining money, reserved for the President \n\nObama was never used, in other way he created the economic stimulus package ($787 \n\nbillion), which was approved by the congress in 2009\n12\n\n. \n\nThe main objective of the economic stimulus package was to quickly begin the \n\neconomic growth, save between 900,000 to 2.3 million jobs, to ensure the needed \n\nconfidence to restore the economic growth and it has as an objective to restore the trust \n\nin the financial industry. The stimulus package was a success, in March 2009, before it \n\nwas launched, the GDP in the first quarter (Q1) was -5.4% and the Dow had decreased \n\nto 6,594.44 on March 5, 2009. By the last quarter of 2009, the GDP was up to 3.9% and \n\nthe Dow had risen to 10,428. However, not all success can be assigned to the stimulus \n\npackage, since there were other important issues such as the expansive monetary policy \n\nand the emerging markets which both had contributed to stimulate the economy, \n\nalthough the last two were already set in the beginning of 2009, so one can conclude \n\nthat at least the President Obama\u2019s stimulus package gave the investors and markets the \n\nconfidence needed to turn the economy round\n13\n\n. \n\nIn order to show what happened regarding the US GDP during the sample analysis \n\n(2001-2013), is shown in Figure 6 the evolution since the beginning of the 21\nst\n century. \n\nAs one can see, in 2000 the GDP was a little bit above the 4% where it suffered a great \n\ndecrease reaching the value of 1%, which can be explained by the technology bubble as \n\nwell as the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Following the before mention events, the Fed, cut the \n\ninterest rates to an extremely low level, in order to stimulate the economy, which can \n\nexplain the positive variation in the GDP, between 2001 and 2004, where it reached \n\nalmost 4%. Furthermore, this period roughly coincides with the sharp growth of the sub-\n\nprime market among 2001 and 2006, where the quality of loans had become worse and \n\nthe underwriting criteria wider and the fact that house prices had appreciated between \n\n2003 and 2005 disguised the real risk of sub-prime mortgages which was \n\nunderestimated by rating agencies and finally the unsustainable growth of the sub-prime \n\nmarket led to its collapse in 2008 where the GDP almost reached -3%. The time period \n\nbetween 2008 and 2013, represent a global financial crisis that is so far, the worst crisis \n\nsince the great depression of 1930s. According to the World Bank, the US GDP in 2012 \n\n                                                             \n12\n\n http://useconomy.about.com/od/criticalssues/f/What-Is-the-Global-Financial-Crisis-of-2008.htm \n13\n\n http://useconomy.about.com/od/candidatesandtheeconomy/a/Obama_Stimulus.htm \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\nwas 2.8%, which demonstrates a sharp increase since 2009, revealing that the measures \n\nundertaken were successful. \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 US GDP Growth \n\n \n\n                                                                 Source : World Bank  \n\nFollowing the explanation about the events happened and their consequences on the \n\nUS economy as in the World economy as well, since the beginning of the new century, \n\nit is presented afterwards, a brief forecast on the years to come. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-4,00% \n\n-3,00% \n\n-2,00% \n\n-1,00% \n\n0,00% \n\n1,00% \n\n2,00% \n\n3,00% \n\n4,00% \n\n5,00% \n\n2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 \n\nUS GDP Growth \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n2.4 Brief Forecast on Following Years \n \n\nFollowing the explanation about what happen in the world during the thesis\u2019s \n\nsample period, it is time to make a relatively short forecast on the years to come about, \n\nmostly, the economy growth. \n\nIn accordance with CNBC, the Japanese investment bank Nomura have stated that \n\nthe global financial crisis have ended in 2013 and 2014 is the recovery year. As \n\nevidence for this, the bank's equity research team led by Michael Kurtz identified some \n\neconomic indicators that have been improving such as the US real estate market and the \n\nEurope\u2019s economic expansion, among others\n14\n\n. \n\nIn agreement with Nomura is IMF, that stated that during the second part of 2013, \n\nafter a slow start in the beginning of the year, the global activity have been strengthened \n\nand it is expected to continue to increase even further in 2014 and 2015, mostly due to \n\nthe recovery in the advanced economies. The growth at a global level is expected to be \n\nhigher in 2014, with 3.7%, increasing to 3.9% in the next year\n15\n\n. \n\nSimilarly, the White House is in line with the last two points of view. According to \n\nReuters, under its projection, US economy is going to surpass in 2014 the last year\u2019s \n\ngrowth of 1.7% with 3.1%, while the forecast for 2015 is similar, it is going to \n\novercome 2014\u2019s with 3.4%. Moreover, the White House gave some reasons for the \n\naforementioned growth: the decline of budget deficit, the improving house market and \n\nUS energy production, decrease in health costs and advances in technology were some \n\nof the economic drivers pointed out by the White House\n16\n\n. \n\nIn accordance with Bloomberg, S&amp;P 500 Index rose 30% last year for the highest \n\nincrease since 1997, whereas house prices increased in October, comparing with the \n\nhomologous year, for the biggest increment for more than seven years\n17\n\n. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n14\n\n http://www.cnbc.com/id/101231654 \n15\n\n http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/update/01/ \n16\n\n http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/03/11/us-usa-obama-economy-idUSBREA2A00Z20140311 \n17\n\n http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-04/feldstein-joins-summers-predicting-stronger-u-s-growth-\n\nin-2014.html \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nAs it has been shown, the outlook for 2014 and 2015 is better than before, which \n\nmeans that the economic indicators are still going to increase and improve.

One of the most important \n\nfacts is the growth of oil and gas production, petroleum accounted for 77% of 2012 \n\nimports, which is declining due to the increasing energy production. The Real GDP \n\nGrowth is presented in the Figure 7.

Nowadays the US \n\nis the biggest crude oil importer according to Key World Energy Statistics (2013). \n\nAccording to US Environmental Protection Agency, in the US, crude oil is mainly \n\nused for transportation and heating purposes, however a small percentage is used as fuel \n\nfor electricity generating plants\n19\n\n.  \n\nOne of its characteristics is that crude oil come in many varieties as well as \n\nqualities, that is, its features, namely the specific gravity and sulfur content, depends on \n\nthe place where it was extracted from as it is priced\n20\n\n. This is represented in the Figure \n\n8. The crude oil market value depends especially on these two features and so, the \n\ndensity ranges from light to heavy while sulfur content is whether sweet or sour. A \n\nsweet crude oil is characterized by its sulfur content which is less than 0.5%, while oil \n\nwith more than 0.5% is defined as sour. \n\n                                                             \n19\n\n http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energy-and-you/affect/oil.html \n20\n\n http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/904748.stm \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\n The figure 8 represents, the different crude oil characteristics regarding the place \n\nwhere it was extracted from, for instance the Mexico-Maya is the one with the highest \n\nsour percentage and the one with the highest density, and so it is the one with the higher \n\nheavy and sour results. In contrast, Algeria-Sahara Blend and Malaysia-Tapis are the \n\nones with higher sweet and light values and this is the reason why the Algeria-Sahara \n\nBlend, as well as Malaysia-Tapis are priced higher than the Mexico-Maya crude oil, as \n\nit is explained below.  \n\nAccording to EIA, crude oils are priced differently considering its characteristics, \n\nnamely, the crude oils with \u201clight (higher degrees of API gravity, or lower density)\u201d and \n\nsweet, with low sulfur content are normally priced higher than heavy, sour crude oil. \n\nThis is mainly due to the fact that gasoline and diesel fuel are sold at a premium, rather \n\nthan residual fuel and others that are usually more easily and cheaply produced using \n\nlight, sweet crude oil. Basically, the ones that can be got with more rudimentary \n\nprocesses as well as with less energy-consuming refineries are the desirable ones, thus \n\nthe light sweet grades are the most desirable crude oils\n21\n\n. \n\n                                                             \n21\n\n http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=7110# \n\nF i g u r e   8   \u2013   D i f f e r e n t   c r u d e   o i l   c h a r a c t e r i s t i c   \n\nS o u r c e   :   U  S    E n e r g y   I n f o r m a t i o n   Administration   \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Crude Oil, OPEC Oil Basket and Non-OPEC Crude Oil Total Prod Evolution \n\nfrom 2001 to 2013 \n\n \n\n Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream \n\nThe Figure 9 illustrates Crude Oil (West Texas Intermediate) and OPEC Oil Basket \n\nprices as well as Non-OPEC Crude Oil Total Production from 2001 to 2013. In the \n\nbeginning of this period, coinciding with the recession, all variables suffered a loss, \n\nbeing the Non-OPEC oil production the one that suffered the most. After it and until the \n\nglobal financial crisis, the Non-OPEC oil production had a sharp growth, while the \n\nother variables kept a constant growth with similar values. However, when the crisis \n\ntook place, all variables had a big loss in their values, where Crude Oil and OPEC Oil \n\nBasket suffered the major hit. Following this period, all variables recovered and the \n\nCrude Oil and OPEC Oil had different growths, where the OPEC Oil registered, \n\noccasionally, higher values than Crude Oil. \n\nThe need to price crude oil in terms of a benchmark comes from the fact that there \n\nare many different qualities of crude oil, so, buyers and sellers found it easier to have \n\nbenchmarks, thus other varieties are priced at a discount or premium according to their \n\nquality. There are some benchmarks worldwide, such as, Brent, Dubai, OPEC and West \n\nTexas Intermediate. Regarding the Brent benchmark, it is usually accepted as the world \n\nbenchmark and according to EIA it prices two thirds of the world\u2019s traded crude oil. In \n\nwhat respects the Dubai benchmark, it is used to price sales of other regional crudes into \n\nAsia, simply because it is one of the few Gulf crudes available in single, on the spot, \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nsales as opposed to long term supply contracts. In what regards the US benchmark, the \n\ncrude oil is priced in relation to West Texas Intermediate. Regarding the OPEC basket, \n\nthis organization is currently constituted by 12 countries namely, Algeria, Angola, \n\nEcuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates \n\nand Venezuela\n22\n\n. The OPEC benchmark price is determined by the average of all of its \n\n12 countries and one of its objectives is to control the amount of oil they supply to the \n\nmarket in order to keep the price between a predetermined range prices\n23\n\n. In addition, \n\n81% of the world\u2019s oil reserves belong to OPEC which is represented in figure 4\n24\n\n, \n\nwhich give a great amount of diplomatic leverage in worldwide businesses, due to its \n\nimportance. The countries with highest crude oil reserves, as it can be seen in Figure 10, \n\nare Venezuela with 24.8%, Saudi Arabia with 22.1% and Iran with 13.1% of total \n\nreserves and in the other hand the OPEC countries with fewer crude oil reserves are \n\nAlgeria 1%, Angola 0.8% and Ecuador with 0.7% of total reserves.

In 2009, 13.1% of \n\nprimary energy supply came from renewable sources. In addition, 19.5% of global \n\nenergy generation, or in other terms, renewable energies are mostly used for generating \n\nelectricity and 3% of global energy consumption for road transport belongs as well to \n\nRE. \n\nIn 2011 and 2012, in spite of the global financial crisis, policy uncertainty and \n\ndecreasing support in some markets, the demand for renewable energies continued to \n\nincrease (REN21). \n\nRegarding the RE evolution since the year of 2000, Table 2 presents it considering \n\nWind Power, Solar and Biofuel and presenting in the last column, the evolution between \n\n2000 and 2010 in the case of Biofuel or 2011 considering Wind Power and Solar. \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Renewable Energies evolution over the last decade \n\nRenewable Energy 2000 2010/2011 Evolution \n\nWind Power 220 GW 238 GW 8.2% \n\nSolar 1.5 GW 67 GW 4366.7% \n\nBiofuel  16 Billion 100 Billion 525% \n\nSource: IEA \n\nWind Power had grown 18 GW since 2000 to 2011 which represents an \n\nevolution of 8.2%, with an average growth rate over 25% considering the past five \n\nyears. \n\nSolar energy can be directly converted into electricity using a PV cell. Analyzing \n\nthe Table 2, it can be observed that there was an impressive growth, comparing the year \n\nof 2000 (1.5 GW) with 2011 (67 GW), which represents a 4366.7% growth, \n\nfurthermore, over the past five years Solar PV had an average growth rate over 50%. \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\nBiofuel energy reached a value of more than 100 Billion liters in 2010, \n\ncomparing with 16 Billion liters registered in 2000 represents an increase of 525%. In \n\naddition, Biofuel supplies 3% of the world\u2019s fuel for transport, for instance, in Brazil it \n\nrepresents 23% of all transport fuel, while in the US it registers 4% and 3% in the EU\n25\n\n. \n\nIn regard of the VRE, or in other terms, taking in consideration the renewable \n\nenergies that are variable, which includes wind, solar and other renewable energies that \n\nfluctuate during the day or season, or which are connected to the variability of wind \n\nspeed or solar radiation which changes during the day or year season. Coupled with this \n\nflexibility is the market value and price of VRE, which is affected by the amount of \n\nenergy received by the generators, or in other words, during windy and sunny times, the \n\nadditional amount of electricity received decreases the prices, thus because of the higher \n\nenergy reception, the market value of VRE falls with higher penetration rate (Hirth \n\n2013). However, there are measures that can be considered in order to reduce this \n\nvariability, such as more flexible generating capacities as gas and hydro power plants, \n\ninterconnections or storage so that it can be combined to provide the required \n\nflexibility\n26\n\n. \n\nAccording to World Energy Outlook, renewable energies increase their importance \n\nin all long-term scenarios regarding the expectation until the year of 2035, renewable \n\nelectricity generation triples from 2009 to 2035, moreover, when considering the \n\nlimitation of the global warming, renewable energies grow even more, it almost \n\nquadruples.  \n\nAs it is addressed in this thesis, the energy security is one of the major concerns in \n\nregard of the energy supply due to the reduction in oil supplies coupled with the \n\nincrease of global demand as well as political insecurity in oil rich countries (Henriques \n\nand Sadorski, 2008). Taking this in account, it is easy to understand that energy security \n\nhas great relevance for policy driver for RE. Furthermore, the use of RE can reduce fuel \n\nimportation and detach the economy from fossil fuel price rises and variations, which \n\nwould improve energy security. \n\n \n\n                                                             \n25\n\n http://www.iea.org/aboutus/faqs/renewableenergy/ \n26\n\n http://www.iea.org/aboutus/faqs/renewableenergy/ \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\nAs it was covered before, the RE sector is increasing its competitiveness, wind and \n\nsolar PV are growing at a fast pace, portfolios of RE technologies are becoming cost-\n\ncompetitive, moreover, technologies such as hydro and geothermal are frequently fully \n\ncompetitive. Although, some economic barriers still remain and there is a need for costs \n\nto be reduced in order to achieve competitiveness\n27\n\n. \n\nAccording to IEA, there is a need for further subsidies to the RE sector, because it is \n\nbelieved that further growth is essential for a secure and sustainable energy system, in \n\norder to stimulate costs reduction throughout technology deployment, as improvements \n\nin manufacturing, technology performances and economies of scale. This issue has a \n\nspecial importance because in several countries, the policies in place are not the better, \n\nwhich led to higher than anticipated costs and excessive policy costs\n28\n\n. \n\nIn terms of investment in RE, the global investment decreased 11% in 2013, \n\naccording to BNEF (Bloomberg New Energy Finance), which was the second time it \n\ndeclined since 2011. Moreover, financing must double by 2020 and double again to $1 \n\ntrillion by 2030, so that environmental targets could be achieved namely, the global \n\nwarming of more than 2 degrees could be avoided\n29\n\n. \n\nAccording to REN21, the Global investment in renewable power and fuels was in \n\n2012, 244 billion USD, which represent a 12% decline, comparing with the year before. \n\nHowever, if the investments in hydropower projects larger than 50 megawatts (MW) \n\nand in solar power were included, in 2011 the total new investment would have reached \n\na value of 285 billion USD. Furthermore, the decrease in investment, after several years \n\nof growth, came from uncertainty about support policies in major economies, such as \n\nEurope and the US, with the first decreasing 36% and the latter 35%. Although, \n\ndisregarding replacement plants and so considering only net additions to electric \n\ncapacity, in 2012 for the third year in a row, the global investment in renewable power \n\nwas ahead of fossil fuels. These values regarding the evolution in investment in new \n\nrenewable capacity and renewable power capacity (with and without hydro) between \n\n2010 and 2012 can be seen in the Table 3. \n\n                                                             \n27\n\n http://www.iea.org/aboutus/faqs/renewableenergy/ \n28\n\n http://www.iea.org/aboutus/faqs/renewableenergy/ \n29\n\n http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-16/renewable-energy-at-254-billion-let-s-make-it-a-clean-\n\ntrillion.html \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Investment in new renewable capacity and renewable power capacity from 2010 \n\nto 2012 \n\n  2010 2011 2012 \n\nInvestment in new renewable capacity Billion USD 227 279 244 \n\nRenewable power capacity (total, not including hydro) GW 315 395 480 \n\nRenewable power capacity (total, including hydro) GW 1250 1355 1470 \n\nSource: REN21 \n\nIn addition, considering the year of 2012, it saw the most dramatic shift regarding \n\nthe investment among developed and developing economies, whilst the investment in \n\ndeveloping countries in 2011 arrived to 112 billion USD representing 46% of the world \n\ntotal, the investment in developed countries declined 29% to 132 billion USD, \n\nillustrating the lowest level since 2009.

Literature Review \n \n\n In this section, it is discussed the literature with greater relevance regarding the \n\ntopic under the scope. \n\nThe literature on the relationship between the alternative energy stock prices and \n\noil prices is scarce. Henriques and Sadorski (2008) study this topic using a vector \n\nautoregression model with four variables: alternative energy companies returns, \n\ntechnology stock returns, oil prices, and interest rates. Results show that the technology \n\nstock returns, oil prices, and interest rates are related with alternative energy companies \n\nreturns and can explain movements on its stock price. Furthermore, they found that \n\nstock prices of alternative energy companies are more influenced by shocks in \n\ntechnology stock prices than by oil prices movements. \n\n Sadorsky (2008) uses a study on a RE company systematic risk. This paper \n\nshows that increases in company sales reduce systematic risk whereas increases in oil \n\nprice returns increase systematic risk. However, when oil price returns are positive and \n\nmoderate, increases in company sales can offset the impact of oil prices and thus lower \n\nthe systematic risk, although when they are higher it is in general not possible to offset \n\nthe effects with sales growth. The Monte Carlo simulation reveals that oil prices have \n\ngreater impact on beta than sales growth do. It also shows that market returns cause \n\nmore effects on stock returns, followed by oil prices and then sales growth. \n\nKumar et al. (2012) extends Henriques and Sadorsky (2008) work by adding the \n\ncarbon market data from April 22\nnd\n\n of 2005 to November 26\nth\n\n of 2008 using Markov-\n\nSwitching VAR. This paper studied the relationship between clean energy companies, \n\ntechnology companies, oil prices, carbon prices and interest rates using for this purpose \n\nthree indices of clean energy stocks.  This paper demonstrates that the movements of all \n\nthree indices of clean energy stocks are explained by oil prices, technology firms stock \n\nprices and interest rates movements. Moreover, it shows that investors see clean energy \n\nfirms as technology firms and also that the carbon market does not influence the clean \n\nenergy stock prices, which might be due to the fact that the carbon price have been \n\nlower than the oil price and so it has not created any incentive to switch to low-carbon \n\ntechnologies. \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n \n\nManagi (2013) analyzed the same issue but now considering structural breaks. \n\nFor this purpose he uses a four variable Markov-switching vector autoregressive model \n\n(oil prices, clean energy, technology stock prices and interest rates). The results suggest \n\nthat after structural breaks, there are positive relationship between oil prices and clean \n\nenergy prices, which contradicts some papers previously made. These results are \n\nconsistent with those found by Henriques and Sadorsky (2008) before the structural \n\nbreak in 2007, however after it they are contradictory. Managi (2013) found that oil \n\nprices and clean energy prices have a positive relationship after structural changes. The \n\npaper also states that when the economy recovers, it may turn back into a non-\n\nrelationship again, among clean energy and oil prices. \n\n Bohl et. Al. (2013) addresses the evolution of German RE stock returns from \n\n2004 to 2011. To this end, they used the four factor Carhart model which is an \n\nexpansion of the CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model) and Fama French models, that \n\nadds the momentum (factor which is the difference between the highest 30% and the \n\nlowest 30% stock returns). The German government undertook several measures and \n\npolicies in order to change to alternative energies. This study found that the German \n\nstock analyzed from 2004 to 2007 was perceived as a winner, however between 2008 to \n\n2011 the alternative energy sector suffered a great hit with the global crisis and so, these \n\nstocks turned into looser after all. The author considers that in the sub-period 2004-\n\n2007, there was a speculative bubble. To test this, Bohl (2013) used a supremum ADF \n\ntest and the Markov regime-switching ADF test, which confirmed the existence of a \n\nprice bubble. \n\nThe previous two studies seem to concur that there was a structural break, in \n\nboth papers the period prior to 2007 is studied and after it some conclusions were made. \n\nIn the German case were found that since 2004-2007 there was a speculative bubble and \n\nin the other case after structural breaks the relationships change. So, after speculative \n\nbubbles some relationships change and that was the case of the oil prices and clean \n\nenergy stock prices, which after the 2008 break have created a positive one and so the \n\nconnection can be made among the positive relationship with the underperform of \n\nGerman clean energy stock prices. Thus, the positive relationship between oil prices and \n\nclean energy stock prices, have badly influenced the German stocks which had \n\nunderperformed. \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nWen, Guo, Wei, Huang (2013) study the return and volatility spillover effect \n\namong two variables: the stock prices of Chinese new energy and fossil fuels \n\ncompanies. For this matter, the asymmetric BEKK model is used to investigate the \n\nvolatility between the mentioned variables while considering that the volatility spillover \n\neffects might be asymmetric. The sample period used goes from August 30, 2006 to \n\nSeptember 11, 2012; the performance of new energy and fossil fuel companies in China \n\nstock markets is taken from China\u2019s new energy index (NE index) and coal and oil \n\nindex (CO index), respectively. Results suggest that the relationships among the \n\npreviously referred variables are significant and asymmetric, that is, bad news have a \n\ngreater impact than good ones in each of the variables thus, bad news about both \n\nvariables leads to larger return changes in their assets. In addition, however good news \n\nabout new energy stock returns leads fossil fuels returns to fall, good news on fossil fuel \n\nstocks returns cause a rise in new energy returns, although when comparing with bad \n\nnews, these ones causes larger impacts than  positive news do on both variables. \n\nFurthermore, in regard of volatility spillover, both variables spill over into each other \n\nassets variance, and also, volatility spillovers depend on the respective signs of the \n\nreturn shocks of each asset, for example the spillover is greater when the new energy \n\nand fossil fuel returns have different signs.  The results demonstrate that new energy \n\nand fuel stocks are viewed as competitors, substitutes and so, the positive news about \n\none variable could affect the attractiveness of the other, moreover, the results also show \n\nthat new energy stock investment is more speculative and thus, riskier than investing in \n\nfossil fuel stock investment. \n\nTo deeply understand the relationship among oil prices and alternative energy \n\nstock prices is fundamental to perceive the government intervention and so the policies \n\nand measures implemented. Felix Groba and Barbara Breitschopf (2013) study the \n\nneeds and motivations regarding the implementation of renewable specific policies. \n\nThey show that policy intervention has been successful in change relative prices and \n\nthus foster innovation, or in other words, policy intervention can reduce technological \n\ncosts and so lower the final cost, making this industry more attractive. This paper also \n\nexplains the importance of policy mix, market-pull and technological-push policies. The \n\nmain purpose of market-pull policy is to increase the technology usage by creating \n\ndemand for RE technology in one hand by increasing incentives (reduce the investment \n\ncosts, for example) or by rising costs (additional taxes or even technological standards), \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n \n\nwhich can be accomplished by setting a variety of measures, for instance, the \n\nintroduction of carbon-tax, carbon trading scheme, feed-in-tariffs, renewable portfolio \n\nstandards, fiscal incentives or even public finance. Regarding the technological-push \n\npolicy, the main objective is to generate new technologies through Research and \n\nDevelopment incentives. The paper demonstrates that there are different phases in the \n\nnew energy technology deployment and each requires different types of policies, \n\nwhereas the initial phases requires technology-push policies in order to develop new \n\ntechnologies and reduce the producing cost and the latter is more suitable for market-\n\npull policy to commercialize it and put it available in the market to increment the \n\nmarket expansion. \n\nHirth (2013) considered one aspect that was not yet covered the effect of solar \n\nand wind power variability on their relative price. In his paper, it is studied the drivers \n\nof the market value of VRE. In regard of the variable renewable, it includes wind, solar \n\nand other renewable energies that fluctuate during the day or season. Coupled with this \n\nflexibility is the market value and price of VRE, which is affected by the amount of \n\nenergy, received by the generators, or in other words, during windy and sunny times, \n\nthe additional amount of electricity received decreases the prices. Thus the higher the \n\nenergy reception and higher penetration rate, more the market value of VRE falls.  \n\nIn his study, the author reinforces the fact that the electricity generation from \n\nrenewable energies has been growing at a fast pace during the past years, which had \n\nbeen driven by technological progress, economies of scale as well as more subsidies. In \n\naddition, he also states that one of the best option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is, \n\nin fact RE, thus it is expected to grow even more in the following decades. According to \n\nthis paper, the objectives for RE share in EU has to come from 17% in 2008, to 35% in \n\n2020 and finally to 60-80% in 2050, which ensure the growing importance, deployment \n\nand investment in the alternative energy sector in the coming years. Furthermore, most \n\nof the growth has to come from wind and solar power, due to the hydropower potential \n\nis already largely developed and biomass growth is limited by supply constraints. \n\nRegarding the supply, as it goes without saying, the supply of VRE is variable, thus the \n\nmarket value of the electricity depends on when it was produced, which is determined \n\nby weather conditions. Moreover, as the output is characterized by its uncertainty, \n\nforecasts error of VRE generation need to be accounted at short notice which is costly, \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nleading ultimately to the reduction of the market value. In addition, as transmission \n\ncosts reduce the value of wind power for instance, the value of electricity depends on \n\nwhere it is generated, causing far away locations to be costlier than nearby sites. \n\nHirth in his paper also provides measures that could reduce the RE output, for \n\ninstance, in order to stabilize wind\u2019s market value, the wind turbine rotor diameters can \n\nbe increased as well as the hub heights so that, it could reduce the output variability and \n\ncould be helpful to reach that objective. Furthermore, VRE need mid and peak load \n\ngenerators as complementary technologies, gap which can be filled by Biomass as well \n\nas efficient natural gas-fired plants. Hirth found as well that a high carbon price alone \n\ndoes not make wind and solar power competitive at high penetration rates. In addition, \n\nhe found that without technological innovations, wind and solar power will have \n\ndifficulties at becoming competitive on large scale. \n\nAfter analyzed several papers and articles, in which were studied all the \n\nimportant variables in regard of this paper it is time to refer where the data comes from, \n\nidentify the main variables studied in this paper, the data frequency and also the sample \n\nperiod used in the thesis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n33 \n \n\n5.

The main purpose \n\nof ECO is to define and track the clean energy sector, namely businesses that help in the \n\ntransition to a greener society. Individual investors cannot buy directly ECO, they can \n\ninstead invest in an exchange fund which mirrors it, the PowerShares Wilderhill Clean \n\nEnergy Portfolio, with a symbol PBW\n30\n\n. PBW aims to invest in companies that focus on \n\ngreener and renewable sources of energy and currently is composed by 50 companies \n\nfrom different activity sectors: information technology (49.08%), industrials (20.38%), \n\nmaterials (9.76%), utilities (8.18%), energy (6.72%) and consumer discretionary \n\n(5.87%)\n31\n\n. \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 WilderHill Clean Energy Index Evolution from 2001 to 2013 \n\n \n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream \n\n                                                             \n30\n\n http://www.wildershares.com \n31\n\n www.invescopowershares.com \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nFigure 12 illustrates the evolution of WilderHill Clean Energy Index from 2001 \n\nto 2013. As it is represented in the figure, during the sample period, the WilderHill \n\nIndex suffered huge losses twice bounded by the shadow areas. The first one respects \n\nthe Dot-com Bubble crisis in the beginning of the century, whereas after it the Index \n\nrecovered and grew at a constant rate until reach its highest value in this sample period \n\ncoinciding with the beginning of the global financial crisis. Thus, the second time where \n\nthe WilderHill Index registered a sharp decline was in 2007/2008, with the global crisis, \n\nbeing the greatest loss in the period under analysis. The Index value continued to \n\ndecline in the following years, although it had seen a slight ly recovery in the past couple \n\nof years. \n\nKumar et al. (2012) advocate that investors tend to see clean energy firms as \n\ntechnology firms and so, it is important to draw some conclusions regarding it. In order \n\nto examine the importance of the technology stock prices, the Arca Tech 100 Index \n\n(PSE) was chosen. The objective of this index is to provide a benchmark for measuring \n\nthe performance of technology companies, since it was launched in 1982 by the Pacific \n\nStock Exchange. PSE selects companies from different industry sectors as: computer \n\nhardware, software, semiconductors, telecommunications, electronics, aerospace &amp; \n\ndefense, health care equipment, and biotechnology, always ensuring that the \n\ntechnological innovation is at the core of their business\n32\n\n. \n\nThe impact of rising oil prices on alternative energy stock prices is positive, \n\nbecause it fosters the transition to cleaner energy sources that don\u2019t use petroleum \n\n(Henriques and Sadorsky, 2008). To this end, it is fundamental to study the oil prices \n\nvariations, thus,  the closing price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is used, crude oil \n\nfutures contract, which trades on New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). The WTI \n\nis used as a benchmark to set other oil product related prices. In addition it is the most \n\ntraded futures contract which provides relevant information between buyers and sellers \n\n(Sadorsky, 2008). \n\nPrevious researches showed that there is a relationship among interest rates and \n\nstock prices (Sadorsky, 1999, 2001). Therefore, in this paper is used a 3 month US \n\nTreasury bill interest rate (Rf). \n\n                                                             \n32\n\n http://www.nyse.com/about/listed/pse_i.shtml \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n \n\nAfter referred which variables are used in this paper, it is fundamental to set the \n\nsample period. For this study, weekly data was collected from Datastream between the \n\nyears of 2001 and 2013 which is divided in three sub-periods:  2001-2002; 2003-2007 \n\nand 2008-2013. This period was selected in order to better understand the relationships \n\namong the aforementioned variables, since the beginning of the 21\nst\n Century and the \n\nsample period was divided in three different parts so the study could focus on distinct \n\nevents.  \n\nThe sub-periods were chosen in order to analyze what might have changed, in \n\nthe scope of the dissertation theme, between those periods addressing different events \n\noccurred in the World. The first sub-period concerns the analysis of what might had \n\nchanged with the Dot-com bubble and the terrorist attacks of 11\nth\n of September of 2001 \n\n(2001-2002), the second regards the period prior the global financial crisis of 2008 \n\n(2003-2007) and the last, the crisis era (2008-2013). \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Crude Oil, WilderHill, Arca Tech 100, 3 month Tres Bill Int Rate, S&amp;P 500 \n\nEvolution from 2001 to 2013 \n\n \n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nFigure 13 represents all variables used in this paper from 2001 to 2013, West \n\nTexas Intermediate (Crudoil), WilderHill (Winegi), Arca Tech 100 Index (NYSE Arca \n\nTech 100 Idx), 3 month risk free interest rate (Treasury Bill Rate- 3 Month US) and \n\nS&amp;P 500 Composite. As it can be seen in the figure, in the beginning of the sample \n\nthere was a huge loss in the majority of the variables, in accordance with the Dot-com \n\nbubble crisis in the years 2000-2001, where the ones with the biggest losses were S&amp;P \n\n500, Arca Tech 100 Index and Wilderhill Clean Energy Index. After this period these \n\nvariables had a constant growth until the year of 2007-2008, the global financial crisis, \n\nwhere once more, these three variables suffered large falls. After this crisis, the Arca \n\nTech 100 Index growth sharply ended up in 2013 with a higher value than the S&amp;P 500. \n\nRegarding the remaining variables, West Texas Intermediate kept a constant growth \n\nreaching a superior value than the WilderHill Index in 2013, where the 3 month risk free \n\ninterest rate kept the lowest value during the sample period. \n\nRelating the results found by previous papers with those shown in Figure 13, \n\naccording to Henriques and Sadorski (2008) they found that stock prices of alternative \n\nenergy companies are more influenced by shocks in technology stock prices than by oil \n\nprices movements, which can be observed in the figure, when Crude oil during the Dot-\n\n-com crisis remain constant, WilderHill decreased along with Arca Tech 100 as well as \n\nS&amp;P 500. After it, Arca Tech 100 registered a sharp growth along with a recovery \n\nperiod by WilderHill, while Crude oil kept constant values. Moreover, this relationship \n\ncan be understood as investors see clean energy firms as technology firms (Kumar et al. \n\n2012). However, following the financial crisis, all variables suffered a huge loss, there \n\nwas a change in the WilderHill Index behavior, instead of going after the sharp increase \n\nin value of S&amp;P 500 and Arca Tech, the clean energy index remain constant along with \n\nCrude oil until 2013, which can be related to the results found by Managi (2013), which \n\nsuggest that after structural breaks, the case of the global crisis, there are positive \n\nrelationship between oil prices and clean energy prices. \n\nIn Table 5 is presented the Summary Statistics regarding the variables used in \n\nthis paper: WilderHill Clean Energy Index (ECO), West Texas Intermediate (WTI), \n\nArca Tech 100 Index (PSE), S&amp;P 500 and Risk Free Rate (Rf). \n\n \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n \n\nTable 5 \u2013 Summary Statistics \n\nVariables Mean Sd Max Min N \n\nECO -0,1246% 4,9263% 0,145088 -0,15194 673 \n\nWTI 0,1896% 5,5472% 0,273306 -0,36075 674 \n\nPSE 0,0934% 3,2222% 0,093155 -0,09559 674 \n\nS&amp;P 500 0.0478% 2.7243% 0.129509 -0.14908 674 \n\nRf 0,0411% 0,0347% 0,00122 0.0000394 674 \n\n \n\nECO is the only variable with a negative mean, reaching -0.1246%, followed by \n\nRf with 0.0411%, S&amp;P 500 with 0.0478%, PSE with 0.0934% and finally WTI with \n\n0.1896% being the variable with the highest mean value. Regarding the standard \n\ndeviation, as it would be expected Rf has the lowest value, 0.0347%, followed by the \n\nS&amp;P 500 with 2.7243%, PSE with 3.2222%, ECO with 4.9263% and finally WTI with \n\nthe highest standard deviation value, 5.5472%. Considering the highest and lowest \n\nvalues achieved, WTI has the highest value, 0.273306, followed by ECO, 0.145088, \n\nS&amp;P 500 with 0.129509, PSE with 0.093155 and finally Rf with 0.00122, whilst the \n\nlowest value registered, -0.36075 represents the WTI, where ECO comes after (-\n\n0.15194), S&amp;P comes next with -0.14908, followed by Arca Tech -0.09559 and \n\nultimately Rf with 0.0000394 being the only positive value.  \n\nThe variable with higher mean and standard deviation values is WTI as well as \n\nhigher Max and Min values, which illustrates that it is the one with higher values for the \n\nmajority of the sample period as it has the most risk achieving ultimately the Max and  \n\nMin values of the sample period. WTI is the variable with the most unstable and volatile \n\nvalues representing the values with more fluctuation along the sample period. ECO \n\nregardless of its negative mean value, it is similar to WTI having the second bigger \n\nstandard deviation, the second higher Max value and the second lower Min value, \n\nhaving this way a big fluctuation along the sample period. In the other hand, Rf is the \n\none with the lower risk and has a positive mean and although it has not a great Max \n\nvalues it has not negative Min values representing a safe bet. \n\nAfter noting the variables used, the sample period, its sub-periods, the evolution \n\nof the variables during the sample period as well as the summary statistics presents \n\nitself then, the empirical analysis used in order to address the topic. \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n \n\n6. Empirical Analysis \n \n\n In this paper, a multivariate regression examines the relationship between \n\nalternative energy stock prices, oil prices, technology stock prices, S&amp;P 500 and interest \n\nrates. Several tables are presented next in order to analyze the variables, such as \n\nSummary Statistics, Correlation Matrix and the regressions analysis. \n\nRegression analysis is one of the most used tools in market research because it \n\nallows analyzing relationships among one or more independent variable and one \n\ndependent variable, where the independent variables are used to explain the output \n\n(dependent variable). Regression analysis is used to produce an equation that will \n\nestimate the dependent variable, as it was explained before, thus the equation is the \n\nfollowing:  \n\n \n\n                                         \n\nWhere: \n\n?   - Dependent variable \n\n?    - Coefficients or Multipliers \n\n?    - Independent variables \n\n?   - Constant \n\n?    \u2013 Residual Variable \n\nThe   is the dependent variable that the equation tries to predict,    are the \n\ncoefficients that multiply the size of the effect the independent variables have on the \n\ndependent variable,    are the independent variables used to predict   and   is the \n\nconstant, thus when all independent variables are equal to zero,   is equal to   and \n\nfinally    are the residuals present in the estimation equation. \n\nRegression analysis have some advantages such as, it indicates if independent \n\nvariables have a significant relationship with the dependent variable, indicates the \n\nrelative strength that independent variables have on explaining the dependent one and it \n\nis used to make predictions.  \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n \n\nThe Table 6 presents the Correlation Matrix between the variables used in this \n\npaper. \n\nTable 6 \u2013 Correlation Matrix \n\n  ECO WTI PSE S&amp;P 500 Rf \n\nECO 1     \n\nWTI 0,2370 1       \n\nPSE 0,8049 0,1751 1   \n\nS&amp;P 500 0,8012 0,2375 0,8724 1  \n\nRf -0,0023 -0,0142 -0,074 -0,0626 1 \n\n \n\n ECO correlates the most with PSE, 0.8049, followed closely by S&amp;P 500, \n\n0.8012, while the variable with the lowest correlation value with ECO is Rf (-0.0023). \n\nConsidering WTI, the highest correlation appears to be with S&amp;P 500, 0.2375, followed \n\nby ECO with 0.2370, being Rf the one with the lowest correlation values, -0.0142. PSE \n\nand S&amp;P 500 have the bigger correlation values, 0.8724, being Rf, once more, the \n\nvariable that PSE has the lower correlation values with, -0.074. S&amp;P has the higher \n\ncorrelation values with PSE, 0.8724 and the lower with Rf, -0.0626. Regarding Rf has \n\nthe higher correlation with ECO -0.0023 and the lower with PSE with -0.074. \n\n The highest and lowest correlation values are 0.8724 and -0.074, respectively, \n\nbeing the first one among PSE with S&amp;P 500 and the latter PSE with Rf. It implies that \n\nPSE and S&amp;P 500 have a high correlation and so one variable can help to predict the \n\nvalue of the other, whereas, although PSE and Rf have the lowest correlation values \n\nthey have approximately no correlation one with the other because it is close to zero, \n\nthus one variable cannot help to predict the values of the other. \n\n As previous studies state, the clean energy companies are more alike with \n\ntechnology companies than with oil prices movements, which can be explained by their \n\nhigh correlation, ECO and PSE have 0.8049 of correlation values so, one variable could \n\nhelp to predict the values of the other, rather than WTI that have a correlation value of \n\n0.2370 with ECO, which is considered a low correlation. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nThe robust regression is an alternative to least squares regression and it is used \n\nin order to eliminate the effect of outliers, an extreme observation distant from the \n\nothers, which could influence the findings of the paper\n33\n\n. The errors are robust to \n\ncontrol for heteroskedasticity, which means that the standard deviations of a variable \n\nthrough time are non-constant\n34\n\n. In Table 7 is presented the Regression Outputs. It \n\nshows three different models: Model 1 with five independent variables WTI, PSE, Rf, \n\nOil Vol and S&amp;P 500; Model 2 with four independent variables WTI, PSE, Rf and Oil \n\nVol, and Model 3 with seven explanatory variables,  WTI, Oil Pos, D oil Pos, PSE, Rf \n\nand Oil Vol. In every model the dependent variable is ECO. It is also shown, in \n\nparentheses the corresponding P-value, the number of observations, the R-squared, the \n\nAdjusted R-squared and the t-statistics that are statistically significant for a 10%, 5% \n\nand 1% significance level. \n\nTable 7 - Regression Outputs  \n\n Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 \n\nWTI 0,0580** 0,0869*** 0,0082 \n\n (0,021) (0,002) (0,885) \nPSE 0,6973*** 1,2087*** 1,2040*** \n\n (0) (0) (0) \n\nRf 8,0797*** 8,2820*** 8,4167*** \n\n (0,008) (0,008) (0,007) \n\nOil Volatility 0,0060 -0,0207 -0,0440 \n\n (0,901) (0,709) (0,486) \n\nS&amp;P 500 0,7072***   \n\n (0)   \n\nOil Positive   0,0737 \n\n   (0,454) \n\nD Oil Pos   0,0078** \n\n   (0,029) \n\n    \n\nNumber of obs  673 673 673 \n\nR-squared   0,696 0,661 0,665 \n\nAdjusted R-squared 0,694 0,659 0.662 \n\nDependent Variable: ECO; t-statistics * p<0.10, ** p<0.05, *** p<0.01; P-values in parentheses \n\nIn order to analyze the Model 1 regression outputs, R-square shows the amount \n\nof variance of ECO explained by WTI, PSE, Rf, Oil Vol and S&amp;P 500. Thus, the model \n\nshows that approximately 70% of ECO variance can be explained by the independent \n\nvariables. \n\n                                                             \n33\n\n http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/dae/rreg.htm \n34\n\n http://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/heteroskedasticity.asp \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n41 \n \n\nThe Model 1 equation explains that ECO increases 0,0580, 0,6973, 8,0797, \n\n0,0060 and 0,7072 when WTI, PSE, Rf, Oil Vol and S&amp;P 500 go up by one unit, \n\nrespectively. In addition the equation also states that, when all independent variables are \n\nequal to zero, ECO is -0,0059. Thus, the betas (independent variables) which have more \n\nrelative strength in explaining the dependent one are Rf followed by S&amp;P 500 and PSE. \n\nIn Model 2 regression outputs shows that 66% (R-square) of ECO variance can \n\nbe explained by explanatory variables, illustrating a decrease when comparing with the \n\nregression previous analyzed.  \n\nThe Model 2 equation explains that ECO increases 0,0869, 1,2087, and 8,2820 \n\nwhen WTI, PSE and Rf go up by one unit, respectively whilst it decreases 0,02078 \n\nwhen Oil Vol increase one unit, meaning that the increase in the riskiness of oil hurts \n\nECO\u2019s evolution. In addition the equation also states that, when all independent \n\nvariables are equal to zero, ECO is -0,0050. Thus, the betas which have more relative \n\nstrength in explaining the dependent variable are Rf followed by PSE and finally WTI. \n\nThe Model 3 regression output, has a 66% R-square, which show the amount of \n\nECO variance that can be explained by the explanatory variables. The estimation \n\nequation shows that ECO increases 0,0082, 0,0737 0,0078, 1,2040 and 8,4167 when \n\nWTI, Oil Pos, D Oil Pos, PSE and Rf go up by one unit, respectively whilst it decreases \n\n-0,0440 when Oil Vol increase one unit, meaning that the increase in the riskiness of oil \n\nhurts ECO\u2019s evolution. Moreover, the equation also states that, when all independent \n\nvariables are equal to zero, ECO is equal to -0,0096 Thus, the betas which have more \n\nrelative strength in explaining the dependent variable are Rf followed by PSE. \n\nThe coefficients with more relative strength in explaining the dependent variable \n\nin the three models are Rf and PSE and in the first model, S&amp;P 500, and in the second \n\nmodel, WTI, appear to have also more relative strength than the remain variables.  \n\nThe R-square shows the amount of variance of ECO explained by the \n\nindependent variables. Thus, Model 1 shows that 69.6%, Model 2 66.1% and Model 3 \n\n66.5% of ECO variance that can be explained by the independent variables, whilst the \n\nAdjusted R-square represents the same as R-square but adjusted by the number of \n\nobservations as well as the number of variables in the regression, which provide a more \n\ntruthful association among the variables. For instance, when the number of variables is \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n42 \n \n\nsmall and the number of observations is very large, the Adjusted R-square is closer to \n\nR-square. Which is exactly what happens in the models, both have a large number of \n\nobservations (673) and a small number of variables, the R-squared is equal to 69.6%, \n\nwhile the Adjusted R-squared is 69.4% in the first model, a 66.1% R-squared and a \n\n65.9% Adjusted R-squared in the second one and finally 66.5% R-squared and 66.2% \n\nAdjusted R-squared in the third model, thus according to Adjusted R-squared the \n\nexplanatory variables can explain 69.4%, 65.9% and 66.2% of ECO\u2019s evolution. \n\nWhen the estimators are analyzed to check if they are statistical significant or \n\nnot, the Model 1 has WTI (b=0,0580; p=0,021), PSE (b= 0,6973; p=0),Rf (b=8,0797; \n\np=0.008) and S&amp;P 500 (b=0,7072; p=0) are statistically significant making them related \n\nwith ECO\u2019s evolution, whilst Oil Vol (b=0,0060; p=0.901) is not statistically significant \n\nand so it seems to be unrelated with ECO. Thus, when WTI increases and because its \n\ncoefficient is positive it is expected that ECO grows as well, where the same happens \n\nwith PSE, Rf and S&amp;P 500. The results found are consistent with previous studies.  \n\nIn Model 2 the variables WTI (b=0,0869; p=0,002), PSE (b=1,2087; p=0) and Rf \n\n(b=8,2820; p=0,008) are statistically significant making them related with ECO\u2019s \n\nevolution, whilst Oil Vol (b= -0,0207; p=0,709) is not statistically significant and so it \n\nappears to be unrelated with ECO. Thus, when WTI increases and because its \n\ncoefficient is positive it is expected that ECO grows as well, happening the same with \n\nPSE and Rf. \n\nIn Model 3 the independent variables D Oil Pos (b=0,0078; p=0,029), PSE \n\n(b=1,2040; p=0,000), Rf (b=8,4167; p=0,007) are statistically significant making them \n\nrelated with ECO\u2019s evolution, whilst WTI (b=0,0082; p=0,885), Oil Pos (b=0,0737; \n\np=0,454), Oil Vol (b= -0,0440; p=0,486) are not statistically significant and so seem to \n\nbe unrelated with ECO.                   \n\nThe Figures 14, 15, 16 and 17 present rolling windows that show the evolution \n\nof WTI, PSE, Rf and Oil Vol along the sample period. \n\n Figure 14 shows WTI evolution during the sample period, it registered three big \n\nlosses. One in the beginning of the sample period due to the terrorist attacks and the \n\nDot-com bubble crisis, then it grew to its maximum value in this sample period and \n\nregistered its biggest loss caused by the financial crisis then recovered after it and \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n43 \n \n\nsuffered one more fall at the end of the sample period. However WTI registered three \n\nbig losses, its linear trend line is positive meaning that its evolution is positive, although \n\nmost of it had been motivated by the huge growth prior the financial crisis.  \n\nFigure 14 \u2013 WTI Rolling Window \n\n \n\n Figure 15 illustrate PSE evolution along the sample period and as it can be seen \n\nin the figure it had a constant growth with small variations having this way a linear \n\ntrend line positive, initiating the sample period with 1 and ending with 1.5, which means \n\nthat the sensibility to variations increased during the sample period. \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 PSE Rolling Window \n\n \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n \n\nFigure 16 represents Rf evolution through the sample period, as the figure \n\nillustrates, values are mostly constant rounding 0, however there was a big fall in the \n\nmiddle of the sample period registering large negative values followed by a huge \n\nrecovery achieving huge positive numbers, which means that there must be outlier \n\nvalues that influenced in a great way the coefficient estimation   Followed this event, Rf \n\nnote values rounding 0.

Conclusions \n \n\nThe importance of alternative energies is expected to continue to increase in the \n\ncoming years, due mainly to environmental concerns and energy security issues, which \n\nhas great relevance for policy driver for renewable energies. Furthermore, the use of \n\nrenewable energies can reduce fuel importation and detach the economy from fossil fuel \n\nprice rises and variations, which would improve energy security. Therefore, the \n\nimportance of this sector in the global economy is expected to grow and more firms \n\nhave been appearing along the years.  \n\nOil is the most traded commodity, crude oil alone accounts for 15%, which \n\nrepresents the commodity with the greatest importance, followed by Gold (11.5%), \n\nNatural Gas (9.4%) and Copper (7.5%) (Key World Energy Statistics 2013). However, \n\noil consumption has been decreasing, which represents a change towards alternative \n\nenergies. \n\nAccording to IPCC 2013, human influence on the climate is clear, raising \n\ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, forcing positive radioactive and \n\nglobal warming. So, it is fundamental not only, to further develop the alternat ive \n\nenergies, but as well to reduce the human footprint on the environment, in order to build \n\na greener society. In response to this, the US is implementing several policies and \n\nmeasures such as market-based solution to climate change, which provide economic \n\nincentives to those who pollute less, so that the cost of polluting reflects the economic \n\nharm caused to others. Cap-and-trade system and Clean Energy Standard are examples \n\nof market-based solutions (Economic Report of the President 2013).  \n\nThis thesis analyzes the risk factors of investing in alternative energies, using for \n\nthis purpose, a four variable regression where the factors are oil prices, technology stock \n\nprices, S&amp;P 500 and interest rates.   Due to their growing importance in markets, thus it \n\nis of interest of investors, managers and policy makers to know the risks of this kind of \n\ninvestments. The correlation matrix show that clean energy companies are more \n\ninfluenced by technology company returns than with oil prices movements. The \n\nregression analysis show that oil prices, technology stock prices, risk free rate and the \n\nS&amp;P 500 have some relative strength in explaining clean energy stock price movements. \n\nIn addition, it also demonstrates that technology stock price movements are more \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n47 \n \n\nimportant to explain alternative energy stock price movements than oil price movements \n\nbecause investors may see alternative energy companies similar to technology \n\ncompanies. This seems to suggest that investors care about technological innovations in \n\nthis area more than the price of substitute goods. \n\nAccording to IEA, there is a need for further subsidies to the renewable energy \n\nsector, because it is believed that further growth is essential for a secure and sustainable \n\nenergy system, in order to stimulate costs reduction throughout technology deployment, \n\nas improvements in manufacturing, technology performances and economies of scale. \n\nThere are some economic barriers that still remain and there is a need for costs to be \n\nreduced in order to achieve competitiveness. \n\nIn the future, the significance of the alternative energy sector is expected to \n\ncontinue to increase and particularly in the US, several policies and measures are being \n\nimplemented to meet environmental targets, not only to reduce the human\u2019s \n\nenvironmental footprint but also to make the alternative energy markets more efficient \n\nand competitive to be able to change from fossil fuels to renewable energies. In the past \n\nyears, several conferences have taken place in order to face the problematic of the \n\nclimate changes. Thus, in the coming years is expected that more alternative energy \n\nrelated companies are going to appear, especially in the US. The scope of this paper \n\ncould be extended to other countries and different indexes in order to study the \n\nrelationships among the variables in different markets. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAn Analysis of US Clean Energy Indexes Risk Factors \n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n \n\n8.
