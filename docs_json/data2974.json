macroalgae, wood and whale carcasses provide important oases \n\nof organic enrichment at the deep-sea floor, but sediment community structure and \n\nsuccession around these habitat islands are poorly evaluated. We experimentally \n\nimplanted parcels of kelp and wood falls nearby a 30-ton deep-sea whale-fall at 1670 m \n\nin the Santa Cruz Basin (SCr; NE Pacific). At each organic island, we aimed to evaluate \n\npatterns of organic enrichment and spatial and temporal patterns of macrofaunal \n\ncommunity structure and succession over time scales of 0.25 to 7y. Additionally, species \n\noverlap between kelp-, wood- and whale-falls with nearby cold-seep communities were \n\ninvestigated. In general, the abundance of infaunal macrobenthos was highly elevated at \n\nperiods of intense organic enrichment at all organic falls, with decreased macrofaunal \n\ndiversity and evenness within 0.5 meters of the falls. At kelp and wood falls opportunistic \n\nspecies and sulfide tolerant microbial grazers (dorvilleid polychaetes) abounded after the \n\npeak of sedimentary enrichment (0.25y and 1.8y, respectively), while the whale-fall \n\nmacrofauna was highly abundant from 4.5 to 6.8 y, and was dominated by enrichment \n\nopportunist, chemoautotrophic-symbiont-hosting and heterotrophic species grazing \n\nsulfur-oxidizing bacterial mats. Sediments around kelp and wood parcels provided low-\n\nintensity reducing conditions, which sustain a limited chemoautotrophically-based fauna, \n\nwith low levels of species overlap among other chemosynthetic habitats in the deep NE \n\nPacific. Whale-fall sediments harbor many species and trophic types not present in \n\nbackground sediments, but there were low levels of species overlap between the whale-\n\nfall, cold seeps and hydrothermal vents, explained by differences in biogeochemistry and \n\nfood webs among these habitats. We conclude that organically enriched sediments around \n\nkelp, wood and whale-falls may provide important habitat islands for the persistence and \n\nevolution of species dependent on organic- and sulfide-rich conditions at the deep-sea \n\nfloor and contribute to regional and global diversity in deep-sea ecosystems. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0 vi\u00a0\n\nResumo \n\nParcelas org\u00e2nicas de macroalgas, madeira e carca\u00e7as de baleia criam importantes \n\noasis de enriquecimento org\u00e2nico no assoalho marinho de regi\u00f5es profundas, mas a \n\nestrutura e sucess\u00e3o ecol\u00f3gica da macrofauna sedimentar ao redor destes ambientes ainda \n\n\u00e9 pouco conhecida. Parcelas de macroalgas e madeira foram artificialmente implantadas \n\npr\u00f3ximas a uma carca\u00e7a de baleia de 30-ton h\u00e0 uma profundidade de 1670 m na Bacia de \n\nSanta Cruz, Pac\u00edfico NE. Ao redor de cada ilha org\u00e2nica, foram estudados os padr\u00f5es \n\nespaciais e temporais de enriquecimento sedimentar org\u00e2nico e a estrutura e sucess\u00e3o \n\ntemporal da macrofauna em escalas temporais que variam de 0.25 \u00e0 7 anos. Ainda, o \n\nn\u00edvel de sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o entre esp\u00e9cies colonizadoras das parcelas org\u00e2nicas e na baleia, \n\nforam comparados com comunidades de exuda\u00e7\u00f5es frias (uma localizada na bacia de S\u00e3o \n\nClemente, Pac\u00edfico NE) e fontes hidrotermais. Em geral, a abund\u00e2ncia da macrofauna \n\nsedimentar foi altamente elevada em per\u00edodos de intenso enriquecimento org\u00e2nico, com \n\ndecr\u00e9scimo da diversidade da macrofauna num raio de 0.5 metros das parcelas. Nas \n\nparcelas de macroalgas e madeira, esp\u00e9cies oportunistas e tolerantes \u00e0 sulfetos atingiram \n\naltas densidades ap\u00f3s o pico de enriquecimento org\u00e2nico sedimentar (0.25 e 1.8 anos, \n\nrespectivamente), enquanto que ao redor da carca\u00e7a de baleia, a macrofauna foi tamb\u00e9m \n\ndominada por organismos quimiossint\u00e9ticos com associa\u00e7\u00f5es simbi\u00f3ticas bacterianas, e \n\nainda esp\u00e9cies oportunistas que se alimentavam do abundante carpete bacteriano sobre a \n\nsuperf\u00edcie sedimentar. Os sedimentos ao redor das parcelas de macroalgas e madeira \n\nsustentam baixas taxas de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o microbiana e sulfeto intersticial, recrutando assim \n\num limitado n\u00famero de organismos quimioautotr\u00f3ficos e consequentemente com baixa \n\nsobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies com outros ambientes redutores. Na carca\u00e7a de baleia, os \n\nsedimentos sustentam intensa degrada\u00e7\u00e3o microbiana e altos n\u00edveis de sulfeto, mas \n\ndiferen\u00e7as marcantes nas biogeoqu\u00edmica e nas cadeias tr\u00f3ficas presentes nestas carca\u00e7as \n\nresultam em baixa sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies com a fauna de exsuda\u00e7\u00f5es frias e fontes \n\nhidrotermais. Conclui-se que sedimentos enriquecidos organicamente ao redor de \n\nmacroalgas, madeiras e carca\u00e7as de baleia criam importantes h\u00e1bitats para a persist\u00eancia \n\ne evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies dependentes de condi\u00e7\u00f5es sedimentares redutoras, e assim estas \n\nilhas devem contribuir para a diversidade regional e global dos ecossistemas de mar \n\nprofundo.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n\nChapter 1. Introduction \n\n \n\nCommunities living at the deep-seafloor are directly affected the export of \n\norganic matter from the ocean\u2019s surface to depths, which significantly affects the \n\nstructure and dynamics of deep-sea benthic ecosystems (Gage &amp; Tyler 1991, Smith et \n\nal. 2008). Some special exceptions are found at cold seeps and hydrothermal vents, \n\nwhere chemosynthesis is a major process fueling local communities (Tunnicliffe \n\n1988, Levin 2005). Therefore, the typical deep-sea benthos are dependent on a low \n\nflux rate of organic matter (e.g. phytoplankton detritus), which is partially decayed \n\nduring its long and sluggish sink the deep-sea floor (Gage &amp; Tyler 1991). However, \n\nthe export of food to the sea bottom does not always occur at a slow pace and in some \n\nregions of the world\u2019s oceans, seasonal bursts in primary production give rise to \n\nmassive exports of particulate organic material that settles rapidly to the sea bottom \n\n(Billett et al. 1983, Beaulieu 2002).  \n\nAlthough settling of pelagic organic matter may largely contribute to the bulk \n\nof energy that is available to deep-sea ecosystems, the massive episodic deliveries of \n\nlabile organic carbon to these ecosystems are also important (Stockton &amp; DeLaca \n\n1982, Smith 1985, Rice &amp; Lambshead 1994). Macroalgae, terrestrial plants debris, \n\nand carcasses of pelagic animals occur at variable temporal and spatial scales \n\n(Stockton &amp; DeLaca 1982, Grassle &amp; Morse-Porteous 1987). Woody and macroalgal \n\ndebris are frequently deposited on continental slopes through physical or biological \n\nprocesses. Kelps can be released from the coastal zone during storms, high swell \n\nevents, and from herbivory (Duggins et al. 1989, Harrold et al. 1998). Kelp and wood \n\ndebris can then be concentrated and transported to depths in submarine canyons to \n\nform enormous accumulations of organic material in the deep ocean (Vetter 1994, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n\nVetter &amp; Dayton 1998, 1999, McLeod &amp; Wing 2007). Wood and kelp parcels also \n\nfloat out to sea, sinking as individual parcels spanning a broad range of sizes (1 - \n\n>200 kg) to the seafloor (Wolff 1979). Carcasses of nektonic animals (e.g. fishes, \n\ndolphins and whales) are additional sources of energy to the deep sea as they provide \n\nfresh organic material into a food-poor environment (Stockton &amp; DeLaca 1982, Smith \n\n1985, 1986, Smith &amp; Demopoulos 2005). Although the flux of whale-detritus is not as \n\nquantitatively significant as the total particulate organic carbon (POC) flux to deep-\n\nsea oceans, dead whales sink as enormous organic-rich packages that disturb a very \n\nlimited area of the sea-bottom (Smith 2006). For example, the seabed immediately \n\nunderlying a typical whale fall (i.e. roughly 50 m2), can experience the equivalent of \n\n2000 yr of background POC flux in a single pulse of organic enrichment (Smith &amp; \n\nBaco 2003). Consequently, whale carcasses provide an immense and very rich source \n\nof labile organic matter to the food limited deep-sea ecosystems. \n\nOrganic falls are important sources of disturbance to benthic communities \n\nnearby continental margins and in the deep-sea (Stockton &amp; DeLaca 1982, Smith \n\n1985, 1986, Smith et al. 1998). As the scavenging and decaying of the organic falls \n\ntake place, organic detritus [i.e. particulate organic carbon (POC)] is released into the \n\nsurrounding sediments providing food for the infauna (Turner 1977, Wolff 1979, \n\nStockton &amp; DeLaca 1982, Grassle &amp; Morse-Porteous 1987). The spatial succession \n\nalong organic-enrichment gradients exhibits very low diversity and extremely high \n\ndensities of \u201copportunistic\u201d species in disturbed areas, with moderate macrofaunal \n\nenhancement and species diversity at intermediate distances, and very low \n\nabundances and high diversity in the background community (Pearson &amp; Rosenberg \n\n1978, Smith et al. 2002, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). Consequently, the type and the \n\nmagnitude of the organic enrichment will create distinct responses by the benthic \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\nfauna. The organic enrichment attracts organisms through both numerical (e.g., \n\nreproduction of opportunistic species) and functional responses (e.g., omnivores and \n\nscavengers), thus modifying the structure of natural deep-sea communities (Grassle &amp; \n\nGrassle 1974, Pearson &amp; Rosenberg 1978). High levels of organic disturbance may \n\nadditionally promote intense microbial decomposition, depletion of pore-water \n\noxygen and increase levels of sulfides in the sediments (Boetius &amp; Lochte 1996, \n\nSmith &amp; Baco 2003, Treude et al. 2003). Reducing sediments around organic islands \n\nattracts sulfophilic organisms that are capable of deriving carbon from \n\nchemosynthetic symbiosis and are adapted to survive in low oxygen sediments (Fisher \n\n1999, Dubilier et al. 2008). \n\nWhale skeletons generate and sustain organic-rich conditions for years in the \n\ndeep-sea. The broad range of ecological niches present at whale carcasses attracts \n\norganisms not found on background areas, including whale-fall \u201cspecialists\u201d and \n\nheterotrophic opportunists (Baco-Taylor &amp; Smith 2003, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). The \n\ncreation of hard substrata for marine invertebrates also attracts dense assemblages of \n\nmegafaunal animals, including fish and invertebrates (Vetter &amp; Dayton 1998, 1999).  \n\nWood and kelp falls also attract their own set of specialists, including wood-boring \n\nbivalves which degrade the wood matrix as they grow (Turner 1973). Consequently, \n\norganic patches open new areas for colonization of rare, opportunistic and specialist \n\nspecies, and have the potential to increase species richness locally. The role of organic \n\npatches in increasing deep-sea diversity has been raised decades ago, but studies well \n\ndesigned to address this hypothesis are scarce (Snelgrove &amp; Smith 2002). The \n\ncomparison of community structure and succession at distinct food parcels can help \n\nelucidate the contribution of organic falls for beta diversity (i.e. regional scale) in the \n\ndeep sea. The long-term comparisons of community structure also allow identifying \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n\nlevels of species overlap among distinct types organic and sulfide enrichments, such \n\nas around whale-, wood- and kelp falls and cold seeps.  \n\nThe present study will look at community structure and succession at \n\nartificially deployed parcels of wood, kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) and a large whale-\n\nfall; and also investigate the San Clemente cold-seep macrofauna, which are all at \n\nsimilar depths on the California continental slope (Figure 1.1). This study will focus \n\nat the sediment macrofauna at each site and patterns of sediment organic and sulfide \n\nenrichment will be used to help explain ecological patterns at spatial and temporal \n\nscales. Through the comparison and characterization of community structure and \n\nsuccession at a variety of reducing habitats and organic islands on the southern \n\nCalifornia slope (cold seeps, whale-, kelp- and wood-falls) we expect to test the \n\nfollowing general hypothesis: \n\n  \n\ni) Kelp, wood, and whale falls produce highly distinct time courses of \n\nsediment organic loading, which create distinct patterns of community succession; \n\nii) Kelp- and wood-fall communities are less diverse than background \n\nsediments and host a smaller set of specialized fauna compared to whale-fall \n\ncommunities; \n\niii) Whale-fall sediment communities increase local species diversity but share \n\na small proportion (<20%) of species with assemblages at southern California seeps, \n\nkelp falls and wood falls at similar ocean depths. \n\n iv) The San Clemente seep macrofaunal sediment community contains few \n\nspecialized species, and exhibits similar levels of diversity to background sediments; \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1.

Macrofaunal succession in sediments around kelp \n\nand wood falls in the deep NE Pacific and community overlap \n\nwith other reducing habitats \n \n\n \n \nAbstract \n \n \nSunken parcels of macroalgae and wood provide important oases of organic \n\nenrichment at the deep-sea floor, yet sediment community structure and succession \n\naround these habitat islands are poorly evaluated.  We experimentally implanted 100-\n\nkg kelp falls and 200 kg wood falls at 1670 m depth in the Santa Cruz Basin to \n\ninvestigate (1) macrofaunal succession, and (2) species overlap with nearby whale-fall \n\nand cold-seep communities over time scales of 0.25 to 5.5 y. The abundance of \n\ninfaunal macrobenthos was highly elevated after 0.25 and 0.5 y near kelp parcels with \n\ndecreased macrofaunal diversity and evenness within 0.5 meters of the falls. \n\nApparently opportunistic species (e.g., two new species of cumaceans) and sulfide \n\ntolerant microbial grazers (dorvilleid polychaetes) abounded after 0.25 -0.5 y. At \n\nwood falls, opportunistic cumaceans become abundant after 0.5 y, but sulfide tolerant \n\nspecies only became abundant after 1.8 - 5.5 y, in accordance with the much slower \n\nbuildup of porewater sulfides at wood parcels compared to kelp falls. Species \n\ndiversity decreased significantly over time in sediments adjacent to the wood parcels, \n\nmost likely due to stress resulting from intense organic loading of nearby sediments \n\n(up to 20-30% organic carbon). Dorvilleid and ampharetid polychaetes were among \n\nthe top-ranked fauna at wood parcels after 3.0 - 5.5 y. Sediments around kelp and \n\nwood parcels provided low-intensity reducing conditions, which sustain a limited \n\nchemoautrotrophically-based fauna. As a result, macrobenthic species overlap among \n\nkelp, wood, and other chemosynthetic habitats in the deep NE Pacific are primarily \n\nrestricted to apparently sulfide tolerant species such as dorvilleid polychaetes, \n\nopportunistic cumaceans, and juvenile stages of chemosymbiont containing \n\nvesicomyid bivalves. We conclude that organically enriched sediments around wood \n\nfalls may provide important habitat islands for the persistence and evolution of \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nspecies dependent on organic- and sulfide-rich conditions at the deep-sea floor and \n\ncontribute to ? and ? diversity in deep-sea ecosystems.    \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nPlant remains such as wood and macroalgal debris have long been known \n\nfrom  the deep-sea floor and the fossil record, with first reports dating from The \n\nChallenger expedition (Wolff 1979, Kiel &amp; Goedert 2006).  Deep-sea imaging and \n\ntrawl studies suggest that wood and macroalgal falls occur widely on the ocean floor \n\n(Wolff 1979, Pailleret et al. 2007). Woody and macroalgal debris are frequently \n\ndeposited on continental slopes through physical or biological processes. For \n\nexample, kelp is released from the coastal zone during storms, high swell events, and \n\nfrom herbivory (Duggins et al. 1989). Kelp and wood debris can be concentrated and \n\ntransported to depths in submarine canyons to form enormous accumulations of \n\norganic material in the deep ocean (Vetter 1994, Vetter &amp; Dayton 1998, 1999, \n\nMcLeod &amp; Wing 2007). Wood and kelp parcels also float out to sea, sinking as \n\nindividual parcels spanning a broad range of sizes (1 - 1000 kg) to the seafloor (Wolff \n\n1979, Smith 1983, C. Smith personal observations during >100 submersible and \n\nremotely operated vehicle dives off California and Hawaii). \n\nIt is long recognized that food falls at the deep-sea floor can contribute to beta \n\ndiversity in deep-sea by creating patches of organic enrichment and chemical or \n\nphysical disturbance (Stockton &amp; DeLaca 1982, Smith &amp; Hamilton 1983, Smith 1985, \n\n1986, Grassle &amp; Morse-Porteous 1987, Snelgrove &amp; Smith 2002).  However, patterns \n\nof succession resulting from the arrival of kelp and wood falls, and the identity of \n\ntheir characteristic species remain essentially unstudied along the bathyal Californian \n\nslope. Such information is essential to understanding the recycling of different types \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nof organic parcels (e.g., sunken kelp paddies, logs) on the continental slope and their \n\nroles in maintaining biodiversity in the deep northeast Pacific (Snelgrove et al. 1992, \n\nSnelgrove et al. 1996, Snelgrove &amp; Smith 2002).  \n\nThe effects of small-scale, low intensity disturbances on deep-sea infaunal \n\ncommunities, resulting from algal enrichment and scavenger disturbance, have been \n\nevaluated in a number of deep-experiments; these disturbances produce modest \n\nincreases on species diversity (Levin &amp; Smith 1984, Snelgrove &amp; Smith 2002). \n\nHowever, substantial organic enrichment of deep-sea sediments (e.g., from \n\nmacroalgae, wood falls, diatom detritus, and whale falls) can cause dramatic \n\npopulation enhancement of opportunistic and sulfophilic species (e.g. capitellid and \n\ndorvilleid polychaetes, leptostracans and cumaceans; (Turner 1977, Smith 1986, \n\nGrassle &amp; Morse-Porteous 1987, Snelgrove et al. 1994, Smith et al. 2002, Smith &amp; \n\nBaco 2003). Community patterns in organic-rich sediments around whale falls \n\nresemble the classic spatial succession described along organic-enrichment gradients \n\nin shallow-water [e.g., (Pearson &amp; Rosenberg 1978)] with very low diversity and \n\nextremely high densities of opportunistic polychaetes species adjacent to the whale \n\nfall, moderate macrofaunal enhancement and species diversity at intermediate \n\ndistances, and low abundances and high diversity in the background community \n\n(Smith et al. 2002, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). During later stages of succession, deep-sea \n\nwhale falls also support substantial assemblages of animals with chemoautotrophic \n\nendosymbionts, producing reducing habitats ecologically similar to vents and seeps \n\n(Smith &amp; Baco 2003, Treude et al. 2009). \n\n  Large wood and kelp parcels also have the potential to produce intense \n\norganic enrichment and reducing habitats in deep-sea sediments. Deep-sea wood falls \n\nare initially processed by wood-boring xylophagainae bivalves (Turner 1977, Wolff \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n1979, Distel &amp; Roberts 1997, Turner 2002, Voight 2007b) which may broadcast \n\norganic-rich fecal material onto surrounding sediments (Turner 1977), potentially \n\ncreating organic and sulfide-rich sediments. The breakdown of large kelp \n\naccumulations at the deep-sea floor also has the potential to create organic and \n\nsulfide-rich sediment patches against an oligotrophic background (Vetter 1994, 1996, \n\nVetter &amp; Dayton 1998). \n\nWhile deep-sea wood and kelp falls are common on regional scales, temporal \n\npatterns of infaunal community succession around large wood and kelp parcels \n\nremain very poorly studied.  Thus, the contribution of wood- and kelp-fall \n\ncommunities to beta diversity in the deep sea, and their relationship to deep-sea \n\nreducing assemblages (e.g., vent, seep and whale-fall communities) cannot be \n\nevaluated.  In this study, we investigated macroinfaunal structure for over 5 years \n\naround experimentally implanted kelp and wood parcels in the bathyal NE Pacific to \n\ntest the following hypotheses:   \n\n1) Large wood and kelp falls exhibit distinct patterns of infaunal macrobenthic \n\ncommunity succession, promoting beta diversity in the deep sea;  \n\n2) There is little species overlap between sediment communities around large \n\nwood and kelp parcels and other reducing habitats (whale falls, seeps and \n\nvents) at similar depths in the deep sea. \n\n \n\n2.2. Materials and Methods \n\nStudy site, deployments and sampling \n\n \n\nExperimental implantations of kelp and wood parcels were conducted near \n\nwell-studied whale falls off southern California (Smith &amp; Baco 2003) (Fig. 1.1). In \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nparticular, wood and kelp parcels were implanted on the flat sediment-covered floor \n\nof Santa Cruz Basin (SCrB), California (~33\u00b0 27\u2019 N, 119\u00b0 22\u2019W, 1670 m depth, \n\nbottom temperature ~4\u00b0C, bottom-water oxygen concentration 260 \u00b5M (Treude et al. \n\n2009). \n\nFour parcels of wood and kelp were experimentally deployed at a mean water \n\ndepth of 1670 m in the SCrB (Fig. 1.1, point A; Table 2.1), approximately 100 m \n\nfrom an experimental 30-ton whale carcass (Smith &amp; Baco 2003, Treude et al. 2009). \n\nWood parcels were deployed in October 1999 and May 2002 (Table 2.1). Kelp \n\nparcels were deployed in May 2002 and July 2002 (Table 2.1). Each kelp parcel \n\nconsisted of ~100 kg (4-5 whole plants) of fresh Macrocystis pyrifera contained in a \n\n5-cm stretch mesh nylon net bag with one kelp holdfast protruding from the bag to \n\nfacilitate sampling of kelp associated fauna; Fig. 2.1). The wood parcels consisted of \n\n~200 kg of untreated Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) with four small, 2-kg wood \n\npackages inside a 2.5-cm stretch mesh nylon net bags attached to the upper surface \n\n(Fig. 2.1). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 A.

Dark sediments \naround it represent sulfide rich sediments. B. 200Kg wood parcel that has been deployed at \nSCrB for two years.  Small wood packs inside 2.5cm mesh net nylon bags are attached on the \ntop of the parcel. C. Detail showing the presence of bacterial mats nearby the kelp falls at \n0.25 y. \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nKelp and wood parcels were sampled using the Remotely Operated Vehicle \n\n(ROV) Tiburon during three cruises on board of the RV Western Flyer (Table 2.1). \n\nKelp parcels were sampled at 0.25 and 0.5 years after deployment, while wood \n\nparcels were sampled at 0.5, 1.8, 3 and 5.5 y after deployment (Table 2.1). Sampling \n\noccurred around distinct parcels for each time interval; because parcels were located \n\nwithin several hundreds meters of one another on the homogenous basin floor, we \n\nassumed that all fall types were bathed in the same larval pool, i.e., location effects \n\nwere modest compared to treatment effects.  At all sites, three randomly located \n\ntransects radiating outward from the treatment were sampled, collecting tube cores (7 \n\ncm diameter, 10 cm deep) at 0 m, 0.5 m, 1.0 m and 2.0 m from the parcel. \n\nBackground samples (17 replicate tube cores) were additionally collected in 2002, \n\n2004 and 2005 at random locations of 9-100 meters away from any parcel, allowing \n\naveraging of temporal patterns in the background Santa Cruz Basin. Tube cores were \n\nimmediately sectioned into 0-1, 1-5 and 5-10 cm horizons and fixed in 4% buffered \n\nformaldehyde-seawater solution until laboratory analysis, or frozen at -20oC for \n\norganic carbon analysis in laboratory. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1.

Metazoan trophic group classification was made according to (Kukert &amp; Smith \n\n1992). Sediment samples for organic carbon and nitrogen analysis were acidified to \n\nremove carbonates by repeated additions of sulfurous acid (8 % v/v) until no \n\neffervescence was observed (Verardo et al. 1990) and then analyzed using a Perkin-\n\nElmer 2400 CHN Elemental Analyzer, with a limit of detection of 1 mg and 1.2 mg \n\nfor C and N, respectively, while the precision was 0.3 % and 0.4 % for C and N, \n\nrespectively. CHN standards were made with acetanilide and blanks were made of \n\nboth non-acidified and acidified cups, both giving minor signals of TOC and TN. \n\nA few top-ranked macrofaunal organisms at representative stages of \n\ncommunity succession on kelp and wood parcels were selected for stable isotope \n\nanalysis. Individuals were sorted using methanol-cleaned forceps and specimens were \n\nrinsed and cleaned in DI water. Calcareous shelled organisms were decalcified with \n\nphosphoric acid and placed in pre-weighed tin cups for overnight drying (35-40 \u00baC). \n\nMultiple individuals of single species were combined in one sample to make up the \n\nnecessary dry weight of 0.5-2 mg for analysis. Samples were combusted in a \n\nEurovector elemental analyzer and resulting N2 and CO2 gases were separated by gas \n\nchromatography and admitted into an IRMS mass spectrometer for determination of \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios (reproducibility: \u00b10.5 \u2030 for ?15N and \u00b10.2 \u2030 for ? 13C). \n\nMacrofaunal C-isotopic ratios were measured against a Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) \n\nstandard for ?13C and atmospheric nitrogen for ?15N. Results are expressed as delta (?) \n\nnotation representing the relative difference between sample and standard, where ?X \n\n(\u2030) = [(Rsample/Rstandard)-1] x 103, where R=15N/14N or R=14C/13C.  \n\nMacroinfaunal organisms were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution, potentially \n\nintroducing artifacts in stable isotope values, although shifts in carbon isotope ratio \n\nare usually small compared to the wide natural C variability in marine food sources \n\n(Fry &amp; Sherr 1989, Edwards et al. 2002, Sarakinos et al. 2002). In this study, we \n\ncorrected for preservation artifacts by adding 1\u2030 to ? 13C (Baco-Taylor 2002, \n\nSarakinos et al. 2002, Demopoulos et al. 2007). Trophic shift boxes from potential \n\norganic matter sources at kelp and wood parcels helped to determine potential food \n\nsources (Fry 2006). Trophic changes of 3 \u2030 were added to the range of ?15N values \n\nobtained for each organic matter source (DeNiro &amp; Epstein 1978, Minagawa &amp; Wada \n\n1984, Fisher et al. 1994). Species that exclusively use a particular source for nutrition \n\nare expected to fall within the appropriate trophic-shift box. Isotope values from kelp \n\nplants were obtained from the published literature (Page et al. 2008). A multi-source \n\nmixing model was used to calculate proportional contributions of each primary \n\norganic matter source (i.e.: kelp, wood, sedimentary organic carbon and bacterial mats \n\ngrowing on sulphidic sediments around treatments) to the benthic food web \n\n[IsoSource software; (Phillips &amp; Gregg 2003)]. This model examines all possible \n\ncombinations of each source contribution (0-100%) in small increments (e.g., 1%), \n\nwhere the combinations that best fit to the observed species isotope signature are \n\nconsidered feasible (Phillips &amp; Gregg 2003). A mixing polygon was drawn around \n\nfauna samples, with polygon apices representing end members for each organic \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nmatter source (Demopoulos et al. 2007). Mixing contributions were calculated for \n\nconsumers that fit within the mixing polygon, using a priori faunal corrected (i.e. \n\ntrophic fractionation) isotope measurements for each trophic group (Kukert &amp; Smith \n\n1992, Phillips &amp; Gregg 2003, Demopoulos et al. 2007). We assumed a ?15N \n\nfractionation of 3\u2030 for omnivores, deposit feeders and \u201cother\u201d trophic levels (Fry \n\n1988, 2006, Demopoulos et al. 2007). Statistical tests to detect differences on the \n\ncontribution of organic sources to the fauna were performed using the IsoError \n\nsoftware (Phillips &amp; Gregg 2001). \n\nStatistical analyzes on sediment organic content were examined with Student t \n\ntest of means or Kruskal-Wallis, when the number of replicates allowed. Patterns of \n\nfaunal abundance, faunal similarity and diversity were compared among distances and \n\ntime for each treatment type. Total densities around treatments and in ambient \n\nsediments were examined with One-Way ANOVA if normality of variances was \n\npresent. If homogeneity of variances was not attained, a non-parametric Kruskal-\n\nWallis test was performed. For significant ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis results, post-\n\nhoc tests were used to examine difference in means [statistical package BioEstat? \n\n(Zar 1996)]. Species diversity was evaluated for pooled replicate cores at each \n\ndistance sampled (n=1-4) due to the low density of metazoans. Hulbert\u2019s rarefaction \n\ncurves (ESn) were used to compare species diversity between treatments. ESn gives an \n\nestimative of the number of species that would be found in a given number of \n\nindividuals, interpolated from the number of species collected in each sample \n\nassuming a random distribution of individuals within samples (Hulbert 1971). \n\nAlthough this index tends to overestimate within-sample diversity, it is widely use to \n\ncompare deep-sea samples of different sizes (Levin et al. 2001). Values of ESn were \n\ncompared at n=10, n=25 and n=50, where possible. Near treatment samples were \n\n\n\n 18 \n\ncompared at higher n values, because these samples contained higher abundances and \n\nwere particularly interesting as they were directly influenced by the treatments. \n\nBackground replicate cores (n=17) from 2002, 2004 and 2005 were combined to \n\ncalculate a composite diversity from the background community; with confidence \n\nlimits calculated from pooled cores. From rarefaction \u201cknots\u201d obtained in each pooled \n\nsample, a one-tailed 95% confidence interval was calculated using the T distribution. \n\nDiversity curves were then compared to the background confidence curve in order to \n\ntest for statistical differences on diversity (Smith 1986). Additionally, Pielou\u2019s \n\nevenness values (J\u2019) is given to provide further information on community structure \n\n(Clarke &amp; Warwick 2001). The relative abundance of trophic guilds at each period \n\nsampled was integrated by distance in order to increase the power of statistical \n\nanalyzes. Samples from 0 m and 0.5 m were compared against the background in \n\norder to evaluate changes in trophic structure nearby our treatments; and examined \n\nwith ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis. \n\nCluster analyses and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based on \n\nspecies-abundance data from standardized quantitative samples (PRIMER v6, (Clarke \n\n&amp; Gorley 2006); were used to compare community structure across distance and time. \n\nSquare-root transformations were used prior to multivariate analysis in order to \n\nbalance the importance of common and rare species (Clarke &amp; Warwick 2001). \n\nClustering and ordination analyses were often combined to verify mutual consistency. \n\nAnalysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was performed on standardized quantitative \n\nsamples to determine significant differences between groups (distance and time) and \n\ndissimilarity percentages identified species contributions to these patterns (SIMPER \n\nanalysis, (Clarke &amp; Warwick 2001).  \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nIn order to determine the level of species overlap between kelp, wood and \n\nother reducing habitats, we restricted our direct comparisons to relatively abundant \n\nspecies (i.e., over 1% rel. ab. at any treatment type) collected nearby our treatments \n\n(i.e. 0 to 0.5 meters) and that were not sampled in ambient sediments (i.e. total of 17 \n\nbackground cores from 2002, 2004 and 2004). We excluded rare species (less than \n\n1% rel. abundance) from our comparisons in order to account for difficulties in \n\ntaxonomic identification and undersampling biases. Comparisons of species overlap \n\nwith other published studies were carried out at the genus and species level in order to \n\naccount for differences in taxonomic identification between studies. \n\n \n\n2.3. Results \n\nSedimentary organic carbon and nitrogen at kelp and wood parcels \n\n \n\n After 0.25 years, percent organic carbon (TOC) in surface sediments near kelp \n\nfalls was only 0.5% above background levels, with a spatial decrease in sedimentary \n\nTOC from 0 m to 1m (Fig. 2.2). After 0.5 years, the TOC levels at 0 meters was \n\nsignificantly higher than 0.5 meters away (t=-11.045, d.f.=2,  p=0.008), although no \n\nsignificant temporal increase in TOC was observed at 0 meters (Fig. 2.2). The \n\ncombined TOC content in nearest 0-0.5 meters from the kelp falls at 0.5 y was \n\nsignificantly higher than 0.25 y and background sediments (Kruskal-Wallis, H=7.833, \n\nd.f.=2,  p=0.02). Sedimentary percent organic nitrogen (TON) was also slightly \n\nelevated near kelp parcels at 0.25 y, with significant differences from 0.5 meters and \n\nbackground sediments (t=6.05, d.f.=5, p=0.0018; Fig. 2.2). Sedimentary C/N ratios \n\nconfirm the presence of relatively labile (i.e., nitrogen-rich) material at 0 m after 0.25 \n\n\n\n 20 \n\ny. C/N ratios were significantly lower at 0.25 y at 0 meters than all other distances \n\nand background sediments (t=-15.94, d.f.=4, p<0.01; Fig. 2.2).  \n\nSedimentary TOC and TON around wood parcels resembled those in \n\nbackground levels at 0.5 and 1.8 y after deployment (Fig. 2.2). However, by the 3 y, \n\nsurface sediments adjacent to wood parcels had become massively enriched in organic \n\nenrichment, with TOC 3-6 times higher than background values (t=17.37, d.f.=1, \n\np<0.001; Fig. 2.2). In addition, C/N ratios were extremely high (up to 82.9 C:N; \n\nt=52.49,d.f.=1, p<0.001) compared to all other distances sampled, suggesting \n\nenrichment from relatively refractory woody material. Mean TOC and C/N ratios in \n\nsurface sediments near wood falls were still well above ambient levels after 5.5 y \n\n(Fig. 2.2).  In addition, percent organic nitrogen was depressed in surface sediments \n\nnear the wood parcel to distances of 2 m after 5.5 y (ANOVA, F=61.64, d.f.=1, \n\np=0.0005), suggesting that low C/N ratio woody organic material had spread some \n\ndistance from the wood parcel (Fig. 2.2). \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2.

At 0.25 y, macroinfaunal abundance within \n\n0.5 m of kelp parcel was significantly enhanced by ~5\u2013fold relative to background \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nsediments (Fig. 2.3A). This pattern persisted relative unchanged after 0.5 y (Kruskal-\n\nWallis, H =24.05; d.f.=8, p=0.002; Fig. 2.3A - Inset). At distances of over 0.5 meters \n\nfrom the kelp, macroinfaunal abundance remained near ambient levels at both 0.25 \n\nand 0.5 y (Fig. 2.3A). \n\nDorvilleid polychaetes and cumaceans dominated sediments within 0.5 m of \n\nkelp falls after 0.25 y and 0.5 y, but were rare in ambient sediments (Fig. 2.3B). The \n\nfour top-ranked species at 0.25 y constituted over 88% of all individuals at 0 m, and \n\ndorvilleids and cumaceans represented over 36 and 34 % of the total macrofauna, \n\nrespectively (Table 2.2, Fig. 2.4).  At 0.5m, cumaceans still responded for over 55% \n\nof all macrofaunal individuals at 0.25 y (Fig. 2.3B, Fig. 2.4). At distances of ? 1 m \n\nfrom the kelp parcels at 0.25 y, background species dominated the infaunal \n\ncommunity.  At 0.5 y, cumaceans and dorvilleids still dominated the macrofaunal \n\ncommunity at a distance of 0 m, with background species becoming abundant at \n\ndistances ? 0.5 m form the kelp (Fig. 2.4, Table 2.2). The rapid increase in abundance \n\nof the two species of cumaceans (Cumella sp. A and Cumacean sp. K) and the \n\ndorvilleid Ophryotrocha sp. A within 0.5 m from the kelp treatments suggests this \n\nspecies are opportunistically responding to enrichment and disturbance conditions \n\n(Grassle &amp; Grassle 1974, Pearson &amp; Rosenberg 1978). The cumacean species that \n\nresponded to the kelp enrichment in this study were not typically encountered in our \n\nbackground communities, but they colonize enrichment experiments in deep-sea \n\nregions, including fish and whale-falls in the NE Pacific (Smith 1986, Snelgrove et al. \n\n1996, Smith et al. in prep). \n\n\n\n 23 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3.

A and the two cumacean species, \n\nlowered species evenness (J\u2019) and diversity nearby kelp treatments, at both times \n\nsampled (Table 2.3). At 0 m, species dominance was significantly higher than \n\nbackground sediments during both periods sampled (Kruskal-Wallis, H= 12.96, d.f.= \n\n4, p=0.01). Species diversity (ESn) increased from 0.25 y to 0.5 y within 0.5 meters of \n\nkelp parcels (Table 2.3, Fig. 2.5). At 0.25 y, rarefaction diversity was significantly \n\nlower within 0.5 m of the kelp treatments, if compared to background samples (Fig. \n\n2.5). At 0.5 y, diversity increased towards background sediments at distance of over \n\n0.5 m, but diversity was still significantly depressed at the 0 m macroinfaunal \n\ncommunity (Fig. 2.5). The diversity changes around kelp treatments suggest that \n\nalthough areas nearby the parcels were being negatively affected by the enrichment \n\nand disturbance conditions after 0.5 y, the macrofauna in sediments over 0.5 m had \n\nreturned to background conditions. \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nTable 2.2.

Rarefaction diversity for Kelp macrofauna 0.25 y and 0.5 y. \n \n\nTrophic-group analysis revealed large changes adjacent to kelp parcels (i.e., ? \n\n0.5 m) after 0.25 \u2013 0.5 y. At 0.25 y, the high abundance of dorvilleids and cumaceans \n\ndramatically increased the proportion of omnivores (OMNI, Kruskal-Wallis, \n\nH=6.836, d.f.=2, p=0.02) and the  \u201cother\u201d trophic group (Kruskal-Wallis, H=16.624, \n\nd.f.=2, p<0.01) within 0.5 meters from the treatments (Fig. 2.6). The augmented \n\nnumber of \u201cother\u201d trophic group at 0 m was still significant after 0.5 y (p<0.01; Fig. \n\n2.6). Surface deposit feeders (SDF) were slightly depressed nearby kelp parcels \n\ncompared to background sediments, but no significant trend was observed (Fig. 2.6). \n\nIn addition, sub-surface deposit feeders (SSDF) were wholly absent adjacent to kelp \n\nparcels (0 m) after 0.25 -0.5 yr (Kruskal-Wallis, H=5.70, d.f.=1, p=0.018; Fig. 2.6). \n\nThis suggests that sub-surface deposit feeders were particularly affected by the \n\nphysical and organic disturbances in sediments nearby the kelp parcels. Trophic \n\ndifferences between 0.25 and 0.5 y at 0.5 m suggests recovery towards background \n\nconditions at 0.5 y, with an increase in the importance of SDF accompanied by a \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nstrong decrease in the \u201cother\u201d trophic group (Fig. 2.6). The elevated number of \n\nomnivores and \u201cother\u201d trophic guilds are consistent with the opportunist species that \n\ncolonized sediments and possibly with the augmented amount of detritus within 0.5 m \n\nfrom the treatments. Complete abundance and relative contribution of species at kelp \n\nparcels are presented in Appendix 2A. \n\n \nFigure 2.6.

OMNI-Omnivores, Carnivores and Scavengers; SDF-Surface deposit feeders; \nSSDF-Sub-surface deposit feeders, Other- Trophic groups not determined (see methods). \n \n\n \n\nWood parcels \n\nWood parcels also exhibited dramatic effects on macrofaunal community \n\nstructure in space and time. The sediment near the wood parcels accumulated a \n\nmassive number of Xylophaga washingtonia recruits during the first 0.5 \u2013 3 years \n\n(Fig. 2.7A), presumably resulting from settling response to available wood substrate \n\nnearby. Brooder species of Xylophaga present on the wood parcels may have been the \n\nsource of juveniles that rained down to the sediments after 0.5 y (Voight 2007a). The \n\nXylophaga bivalves never attained adult size within the sediments, although adults \n\nwere present on the wood parcels from 0.5 y onward.  Thus, Xylophaga represents a \n\nsink population resulting from mass effects of the wood parcel (Leibold et al. 2004). \n\n\n\n 27 \n\nBecause Xylophaga appear to represent sink populations in the sediment community \n\nderived from mass effects of the wood parcels, we also evaluated macrofaunal \n\ncommunity patterns with Xylophaga removed from the analyses.  At 0.5 y, mean \n\nmacrofaunal abundance, without Xylophaga, was significantly higher at 0 m than in \n\nbackground sediments; at further distances macrofaunal abundances resembled \n\nbackground levels (Fig. 8B; Kruskal-Wallis test, H=27.98, d.f.=13, p=0.03). \n\nMacrofaunal densities around the wood parcels were significantly elevated at 0 m \n\nafter 1.8 y (ANOVA, F=12.906, d.f.=3, p=0.003), dropping to background levels by \n\n0.5 m from the parcels (Fig. 2.7B).  At subsequent sampling times (3.0 and 5.5 y), \n\nmacrofaunal abundance progressively increased adjacent to the parcels, reaching very \n\nhigh numbers (15,100 \u00b1 2400 ind.m-2) at 0 m after 5.5 y (p<0.001; Fig. 2.7B).  \n\nHowever, macrofaunal enhancement was limited in a spatial scale, with slight \n\nincreases after 1.8 \u2013 5.5 y at 0.5 m, at all time points, and background levels of \n\nabundance at > 1 m from parcels even at 5.5 y, when abundances at 0 m were 15 \n\ntimes background levels (Fig. 2.7B).  \n\nAt the species level, Cumacean sp. K dominated macrofaunal assemblages \n\nadjacent to wood parcels after 0.5 y, although three background species (Monticellina \n\nsp. A, Chaetozone sp. D and Cossura rostrata) remained among the 5 dominant \n\nspecies (Fig. 2.8, Table 2.4). By 1.8 y, Ophryotrocha sp. A (a dorvilleid) and \n\nampharetid polychaetes dominated assemblages at 0 - 0.5 m, with cumaceans also \n\nabundant at 0.5 m (Table 2.4); at further distances, background polychaetes continued \n\nto dominate (Fig. 2.8). By 3.0 y, dorvilleids (two species of Ophrytotrocha) had \n\nachieved very high densities at 0 m, representing over 40% of the macrofauna (Fig. \n\n2.8, Table 2.4) and the chemoautotrophic-symbiont-containing mytilid Idas \n\nwashingtonia was first encountered at the wood parcels (Table 2.4). At 5.5 y, \n\n\n\n 28 \n\ndorvilleids (Ophryotrocha and Parougia) and two species of ampharetids dominated \n\nthe macrofauna at 0 m, with very high abundances (Table 2.4, Fig. 2.8); Cumacean \n\nsp. K, was also abundant. None of the dorvilleids, ampharetids and cumaceans were \n\ncollected in the background community, or even off distances of 2 m from the wood \n\nfalls.  This, plus their larger response to kelp parcels suggest that they are \n\nopportunistic species, or may be wood associated species enhanced by mass effects \n\n(Leibold et al. 2004) from the adjacent wood parcels. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7.

At the other periods, J\u2019 was always within background levels (Table 2.5). \n\nRarefaction diversity demonstrates a clear temporal pattern adjacent to wood parcels. \n\nAt 0.5 y, rarefaction diversity adjacent to the wood parcel falls above background \n\nlevels (Table 2.5, Fig. 2.9); diversity then progressively declines at 0 m from 1.8 to \n\n5.5 y (Table 2.5, Fig. 2.9). The diversity curve at 5.5 y falls well below all other \n\ncurves and is significantly lower than background (Fig. 2.9). \n\n \nTable 2.5.

Hulbert\u2019s rarefaction plot detailing the temporal variability on macroinfaunal \ndiversity at the wood parcels (0 meters only). \n \n\nFunctional group analysis also indicated dramatic wood parcel effects on the \n\nadjacent macrofaunal community, increasing in intensity from 0.5 \u2013 5.5 y. At 0.5 y, \n\nthe dominant trophic groups were largely typical of ambient sediments, although at 0 \n\nm the importance of the \u201cothers\u201d group slightly increased due to the presence of the \n\napparently opportunistic Cumacean sp. K (Fig. 2.10). By 1.8 y, omnivores at 0 m had \n\nincreased to 26%, and rose to 50% of the macrofauna at 3.0  - 5.5 y (Fig. 2.10). After \n\n3 y, the omnivores within 0.5 m from wood falls were significantly more numerous \n\nthan the 0.5 y community and the background sediments (Kruskal-Wallis, H=12.19, \n\nd.f.=4, p=0.016). SDF\u2019s were relatively abundant during the whole period analyzed \n\n(over 30%), with ampharetids being dominant nearby the parcels and cirratulids in \n\nbackground sediments. Subsurface deposit feeders usually represented less than 1% of \n\nthe infauna at 0 m during all periods (Fig. 2.10). Complete abundance and distribution \n\nof species at wood parcels are presented in Appendix 2B. \n\n \n\n\n\n 32 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10.

At kelp \n\nfalls, 0 m samples from 0.25 and one replicate from 0.5 y separated strongly from all \n\nother distances (Fig. 2.11, Two-way ANOSIM R= 0.358, P=0.001). The top-ranked \n\nspecies at 0 m accounted for over 70% of the dissimilarity from the other samples at \n\nboth time intervals (SIMPER). All other samples from 0.5 m to background, clustered \n\nwith each other at 0.25 and 0.5 y, with no distinct difference between them (Fig. 2.11, \n\nANOSIM). Overall, highest dissimilarities in sediments nearby kelp falls and \n\nbackground communities resulted from the dominance of apparently opportunistic \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nspecies adjacent to the kelp fall at 3 months, and the low background densities of \n\nlocal species.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11. Multidimensional scaling plot (MDS) of macrofaunal communities (>300\u00b5m) at \nKelp (top panel) and Wood (bottom panel) parcels on SCr Basin. Grouped symbols denote \nstronger similarity among samples (see text). \n\n \n\nAt wood parcels, the MDS also revealed marked spatial and temporal patterns \n\n(Two-way ANOSIM, p<0.01). At 0.5 y and 1.8 y, all samples generally grouped \n\ntogether with no evident difference between treatments and background communities \n\n(Fig. 2.11, ANOSIM). A dramatic shift in macrofaunal community structure was \n\nindicated at 0 m at 3 y and persisted to 5.5 y (Fig. 2.11, ANOSIM, R= 0.319, P= \n\n0.001). The top ranked macrofaunal species (including apparently opportunistic \n\ndorvilleids in the genus Ophryotrocha) at these two later periods accounted for over \n\n20% of the spatial dissimilarity among samples (SIMPER). Pairwise comparisons \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nrevealed a lower degree of dissimilarity between 5.5 y and the two first periods \n\nsampled, suggesting that macrofaunal community structure by 5.5 y may have been \n\nrecovering towards background conditions (ANOSIM). \n\nThese results confirm our first hypothesis, that kelp and wood falls promote \n\nvery distinct patterns of macrobenthic community succession. The dynamics of \n\ndominant species were distinct between kelps and wood, with kelps promoting early \n\nchanges (scales of 1-3 months) on community composition, which lowered local \n\ndiversity in the short scale as a result of a massive colonization by a few omnivore \n\nspecies (cumaceans and dorvilleids). On the other hand, dominant species altered \n\ncommunity structure around wood parcels only after 1 \u2013 2 years, but the duration of \n\nthe organic enrichment promoted significant changes for over 5 years. A higher \n\nnumber of species colonized sediments around wood falls, likely as a consequence of \n\nincreased food availability, but the fauna became less diverse with time as densities of \n\nopportunist species increased. \n\n \n\nStable isotope analysis at Kelp and Wood parcels \n\n \n\nPotential primary organic matter sources at kelp and wood falls include kelp \n\nand wood biomass, sedimentary matter from deposited phytoplankton, and biomass \n\nfrom chemoautotrophic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria utilizing sulfide emitted from kelp or \n\nwood parcels. Kelp biomass (Macrocystis pyrifera) had the highest ? 13C and ?15N \n\nisotope values from all primary organic sources (Table 2.6). Sediment organic carbon \n\nand wood fragments had very similar isotope signatures (Table 2.6), which were \n\nconsistent with previous studies in the basin (Baco-Taylor 2002). Mats of sulfur-\n\noxidizing chemoautotrophic bacteria growing on whale skeletons off southern \n\nCalifornia had ? 13C signatures similar to the other organic sources but with the lowest \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n?15N values compared to the other sources (Table 2.6). Isotope signatures from sulfur-\n\noxidizing bacteria can have a much wider isotopic range due to variable inorganic C \n\nsources (Ruby et al. 1987).  \n\nTable 2.6.

Temporal differences \n\non isotope signatures from the specimens analyzed were minimal. Based on mixing \n\nmodel calculations, individuals of Ophryotrocha sp. A and Cumella sp. A from 0.25 y \n\nderived most of their nutrition on kelp biomass (57-66% and 58-63%, respectively; \n\nTable S2.1, Supp. Material). Kelp biomass contributed significantly to the isotopic \n\nsignature of Ophryotrocha at 0.25 y if compared to sediments; but with increased \n\ncontribution of sediments in the diet at 0.5 y, confirming their omnivore diet and \n\nsuggesting an opportunistic feeding (Table S2.1). Due to wide temporal variability on \n\n\n\n 36 \n\nisotope signatures, we could not determine the contribution of food sources for \n\nCumacean sp. K (Fig. S2.1, Suppl. Mat.). After 0.5 y, this species had isotope values \n\n(-38.1 and -11.7\u2030, ?13C and ?15N respectively), strongly suggesting nutrition derived \n\nfrom chemoautotrophic food sources [Fig. 2.12; (Fisher et al. 1994, Deming et al. \n\n1997)].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12. Delta13C and ?15N values of top ranked organisms from kelp and wood parcels \ndeployed in SCrB. Left: Organisms from kelp parcels (0.25 y unless otherwise indicated). \nRight: Organisms from wood parcels sampled from 0.5 y to 5.5 y (species with temporal \nreplicates are indicated separately). Boxes represent one trophic shift for a given organic \nmatter source (source indicated next to each box, see methods). \n \n\nAt 0.5 y wood parcels, Cumacean sp. K also had relatively light ?13C and ?15N \n\nvalues, once again suggesting nutrition based on chemoautotrophic production (Fig. \n\n2.12). However, at later times at wood parcels, this species had heavier isotope ranges \n\nconsistent with feeding on wood, sediment organic carbon, and/or sulfur bacteria, \n\nwhich may indicate an opportunistic feeding strategy. A few top ranked invertebrates \n\nat wood parcels fell into, or were close to the trophic shift box for sulfur bacteria, \n\nsediment organic matter, wood or some combination of these (Fig. 2.12). Surface \n\ndeposit feeders such as the ampharetids Amelina sp. and Ampharetid sp.18 appear to \n\nfeed primarily on sediments, while the other dorvilleids fall into areas which may \n\n\n\n 37 \n\nreflect a mixture of sources that were out of the range for mixing calculations, but still \n\nsuggesting that they are omnivorous (Fig. 2.12, Suppl. Material Fig. S2.1). There is \n\nno evidence that any animals fed exclusively on the wood material, but the wide ?15N \n\nsignatures on the fauna highlight the additional availability of food sources (e.g. dead \n\nfaunal biomass) and trophic levels (i.e. scavengers) that existed around these parcels. \n\nMixing model calculations constrained contributions of primary food sources for only \n\nthree species at wood falls (Fig. S2.1). The diet of the dorvilleids Ophryotrocha sp. A \n\nand Ophryotrocha sp. G had a stronger contribution of bacteria and wood at 3 y (28-\n\n32% and 41-60%, respectively), with Ophryotrocha sp. G ingesting lower amounts of \n\nsediments (Table S2.1). An augmented signal of wood biomass in the fauna after 3 y \n\nis consistent with the increased input of organic carbon originated from the break up \n\nof the wooden matrix from the parcels to the sediments nearby. The opportunistic \n\nfeeding on abundant organic sources within the sediments may also have promoted \n\ningestion of bacterial biomass, but its close isotopic signature with the wood material \n\nlimits further assumptions about its importance to the fauna (Suppl. Mat.). The wood \n\nborer Xylophaga had a larger contribution of wood material as a juvenile (> 50%), but \n\nthe adult specimen had increased bacterial carbon contribution, probably reflecting its \n\nmicrobial symbiosis (Distel &amp; Roberts 1997); Table S2.1). \n\n \n\nBiodiversity and species overlap between kelp, wood and other chemosynthetic \n\nhabitats \n\n \n\nThis study collected a total of 64 identified macrofaunal species, of which 27 \n\nwere found at kelp falls and 53 at wood falls. The dominant species found at kelp and \n\nwood falls were not sampled in ambient sediments (Tables 2.2 and 2.4). From the \n\ndominant species sampled at the parcels (> 5% rel. abundance), there were 6 species \n\n\n\n 38 \n\nthat overlap between kelp and wood parcels (9%), and four of those species (Samytha \n\ncaliforniensis, Ophryotrocha sp. A, Cumacea sp. K and Cumella sp. A) are likely to \n\nbe enrichment opportunists (Table 2.7). In addition, one species of polynoid \n\n(Subadyte mexicana), which is likely a predator, was also shared between wood and \n\nkelp parcels, evidencing the increased effect of organic enrichment on the \n\ncomposition of both communities (Table 2.7). Kelp and wood parcels also attracted \n\nunique species absent from background communities and the other parcel type. From \n\nthe 7 species exclusively found at kelps, the gastropod Hyalogyrina n.sp. was the \n\nmost abundant, and is a new species first encountered on whale-falls (Smith &amp; Baco \n\n2003). The other 6 species did not achieve high densities at kelp falls, making it \n\ndifficult to distinguish their kelp \u201cendemism\u201d from undersampling of the background \n\nassemblage.  \n\nThe wood attracted 17 species not found on kelp falls or in ambient sediments, \n\nincluding six dorvilleid species, three ampharetid species, the isopod Ilyarachna \n\nprofunda, and the bivalves Idas washingtonia and Xylophaga washingtona. As for \n\nkelp falls, many species were rare, again making it difficult to resolve wood-fall \n\nendemism from rarity in the background community (Table 2.7). The wood-borer \n\nXylophaga, the ampharetids Amelinna sp. A and Ampharetid sp. 18 reached massive \n\nabundances around wood falls, probably either raining down from the parcel or \n\nexploiting rich organic conditions. The high number of dorvilleids in the wood parcels \n\nsuggests these habitats provide analogous organic conditions (but less intense) to \n\nwhale carcasses, which host over 40 dorvilleid species (Smith &amp; Baco 2003). \n\nKelp and wood parcels share together 21 species with whale falls (25%), of \n\nwhich 13 species exhibit enrichment response nearby both organic islands (Smith et \n\nal. in prep). The level of overlap between kelp, wood and the San Clemente seep is \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nlower (2 species) including to the ampharetid Amelinna sp. A. and the \n\nchemoautotrophic-symbiont-containing mytilid Idas washingtonia. Other dorvilleid \n\nspecies (or genus) are shared with seep and hydrothermal vent habitats (Table 2.7), \n\nsumming to a total of 9 shared species (14%, Table 2.7). Kelp and wood overlaps \n\nwith seeps and vents include the dorvilleids (Parougia, Ophryotrocha and \n\nSchistomeringos) and the polynoids Subadyte mexicana and Bathykurila \n\nguaymasensis (Levin et al. 2000, MacAvoy et al. 2002, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). \n\n \nTable 2.7.

P-present at a specific habitat. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nThe low level of species overlap between kelp, wood and the other reducing \n\nhabitats gives support to our second hypothesis. At the species level, we found higher \n\noverlap between our organic parcels and whale falls, if compared to seeps and vents. \n\nThe low levels of colonization by a specialized fauna, typically chemosynthetic \n\nspecies, were only represented by one mytilid Idas at wood falls. Our successional \n\nstudy revealed that colonizers of kelp and wood falls include a community massively \n\ndominated by enrichment opportunists (Grassle &amp; Grassle 1974), but includes species \n\nresponding to habitat-specific characteristics which may contribute to higher regional \n\ndiversity in the deep-sea. \n\n \n\n2.4. Discussion \n\n \n\nThe transfer of organic detritus to the sediments around kelp and wood falls \n\nexhibited distinct dynamics. The distinct temporal scales of sediment enrichment \n\ncreated by kelp and wood falls was influenced by differences in their composition \n\n(Snelgrove et al. 1996, Hannides 2008). At kelp falls, kelp detritus left from \n\ndetritivores activities and the remaining faunal biomass was rapidly (&lt;0.25 y) \n\ntransferred to nearby sediments (0 m). The organic input lead to the development of \n\nsedimentary reducing conditions around kelp treatments, evidenced by the growth of \n\nbacterial carpets on the sediment surface (0.25 \u2013 0.5 y kelp parcels; Fig. 2-C), \n\nconcurrently with high sulfide levels within the top few centimeters of sediment \n\n(Hannides 2008, Treude et al. 2009). The rapid organic enrichment around kelp falls \n\nindicates the efficient transfer of kelp detritus and its utilization by microbes and \n\nmetazoans. The nutritional value of kelp biomass might facilitate its biological \n\nremineralization by deep-sea scavengers, and by microbes that decompose the detritus \n\nleft behind by the fauna (de Leeuw &amp; Largeau 1993, Vetter 1994, Boetius &amp; Lochte \n\n\n\n 41 \n\n1996, Vetter &amp; Dayton 1998, 1999). Direct faunal utilization of macroalgae in the \n\ndeep-sea is apparently linked to its high quality within an impoverished background \n\n(Vetter 1994, Vetter &amp; Dayton 1999). The massive numbers of metazoans that rapidly \n\nrecruited after kelp deployment, evidences the attractive affect that kelp detritus have \n\non deep-sea detritivores. An efficient remineralization and rapid energy transfer of \n\norganic detritus to the food web is also observed at rich organic packages, such as fish \n\nfalls (Smith 1985, 1986). The efficient degradation of kelp biomass is additionally \n\nsupported by its fast decomposition rates in deep submarine canyons [aprox. 2.5% d-1; \n\n(Harrold et al. 1998)], and evidences the importance of macroalgae detritus to deep-\n\nsea ecosystems (Vetter &amp; Dayton 1998). \n\nOn the other hand, the sluggish decomposition of wooden material, which is \n\nprimarily carried by Xylophaga borers in Santa Cruz Basin, appears to delay the \n\ntransfer of organic carbon to the sediments for at least 1.8 y. After initial degradation \n\nof the wood parcels, fecal pellets (Turner 1977), faunal biomass [e.g. Xylophaga \n\njuveniles that rained down to the sediments; (Wolff 1979)] and principally wooden \n\nmaterial, promoted high levels of refractory organic carbon in the sediments after 3 y. \n\nAt wood falls, its refractory composition likely delays the sedimentary organic \n\nenrichment by a) diminishing scavenging by larger animals thus restricting sloppy-\n\nfeeding, b) requiring wood falls specialists to initiate the break up of the refractory \n\nwooden material and c) limiting sedimentary microbial remineralization (Turner \n\n1977, Boetius &amp; Lochte 1996, Hannides 2008). The organic enrichment around wood \n\nfalls culminated at 3 y and was sustained significantly above background levels for a \n\nperiod of at least 2.5 years. The levels of organic carbon in the sediments encountered \n\nat 3 y wood falls may be one of the highest measured at these depths, but the limited \n\nmicrobial degradation of the refractory wood detritus was indicated by low levels of \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nsulfide in surface sediments (Hannides 2008), and by the visual absence of bacterial \n\nmats around the wood falls. Sediments covered with bacterial mats at cold seeps and \n\naround whale carcasses commonly exhibit high sulfate reduction rates, which is a \n\nprimary source of free sulfide at the sediments (Sahling et al. 2002, Treude et al. \n\n2003, Treude et al. 2009).  \n\nConsidering the high availability of organic carbon but low pore-water \n\nsulfides, wood falls may serve as an intermediate-scale organic and sulfide rich \n\nhabitat between kelp falls and whale carcasses. Kelp falls sustain very rapid increases \n\nin organic enrichment, eliciting small-scale increases on free sulfide, which limits its \n\nutilization by organisms with rapid development such as sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. \n\nAlthough microbial degradation of wood-carbon do not sustain significant sulfide \n\nlevels in the sediments, the long-term availability of enrichment conditions may \n\nincrease habitat utilization by organisms able to harvest low sulfide levels, or with \n\nfacultative chemoautotrophy [e.g. mytilid bivalves; (Fisher 1999, Dubilier et al. 2008, \n\nDuperron et al. 2008, Lorion et al. 2009)]. At the other end, whale carcasses may \n\nserve as end members of organic islands, where massive amounts of fresh organic \n\nmatter take years to be eaten by scavengers (Smith &amp; Baco 2003, Smith 2006), and \n\nhigh bacterial degradation of sedimentary whale biomass provide sulfide levels \n\ncomparable to other deep-sea reducing habitats (Treude et al. 2009). \n\nWe observed marked differences in macrofaunal abundance, composition and \n\nsuccession between kelp and wood parcels, preventing rejection of our first \n\nhypothesis. The patchy disturbance caused by kelp and wood falls promoted distinct \n\nmagnitudes of increased macrofaunal abundance within 0.5 meters from the \n\ntreatments, and reduced community diversity. The colonization patterns at kelp and \n\nwood parcels exhibited some similarities to other deep-sea enrichment experiments, \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nwith several species being rare or absent at background communities but abundant at \n\nthe disturbed areas. At 0.25 y kelp falls, cumaceans and dorvilleids were responsible \n\nfor the increased macrofaunal abundance and low community diversity, a pattern \n\nsimilar to other small-scale enrichment experiments in deep-sea areas (Smith 1986, \n\nGrassle &amp; Morse-Porteous 1987, Snelgrove et al. 1996, Snelgrove &amp; Smith 2002, \n\nLevin et al. 2006). Macrofaunal abundance at wood falls was still increasing between \n\n1.8 and 5.5 years of deployment, with an increase in species richness from several \n\nspecies not seen in ambient sediments, which were likely colonizing new \n\nmicrohabitats created by the falls (Dayton &amp; Hessler 1972, Snelgrove et al. 1996). \n\nHowever, diversity at kelp and wood falls was not enhanced locally and gradually \n\ndecreased with the temporal increase in the dominance of opportunists at the wood \n\nfalls, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Grassle &amp; Morse-\n\nPorteous 1987, Smith et al. 1998). Typical ambient species were also dominant at 0.5 \n\ny wood falls and their high density suggests that they may have been responding to \n\nlow-intensity organic enrichment from the wood parcel (Kukert &amp; Smith 1992). \n\nBackground species were always observed over 0.5 meters from kelps, and many \n\nspecies returned to previously disturbed areas after 0.5 y revealing that the succession \n\nwas leading toward convergence with background conditions. \n\nWood falls attracted specialists prior to any sedimentary organic enrichment, \n\nwith juvenile Xylophaga bivalves being dominant at 0.5 y. Xylophaga bivalves \n\nprocess the wood matrix as they grow (Distel &amp; Roberts 1997, Turner 2002), and the \n\nearly recruitment of these wood-borers supports that they are widely distributed at \n\ndeep-sea depths, favoring their rapid settlement onto any available piece of wood \n\n(Grassle &amp; Morse-Porteous 1987, Pailleret et al. 2007, Voight 2007b, a). It was \n\nremarkable to detect Xylophaga juveniles down on the sediments after 0.5 y, and to \n\n\n\n 44 \n\nconfirm that many of these individuals came from a brooding species present on the \n\nwood falls. The fact that besides X. washingtonia, another brooding species of \n\nXylophaga colonized our wood falls before a period of 3 months, suggests either a \n\nremarkable dispersal ability for the brooding Xylophaga species or simultaneous \n\nhermaphroditism, an adaptation to the ephemeral habitat (Tyler et al. 2007, Voight \n\n2007a, Tyler et al. 2009). Due to rapid and massive colonization, Xylophaga \n\npopulations illustrate well mass effect dynamics with densities controlled by \n\nimmigration and enhanced by local birth rates (Leibold et al. 2004). \n\nThe high density of opportunists modified the macrofaunal functional \n\nstructure nearby the parcels from a typical deposit feeding to scavenger-omnivore \n\npredominance, with broad reductions in subsurface deposit feeders. The significant \n\nreductions in this group suggests that organic disturbance strongly affected subsurface \n\nsediments (Kukert &amp; Smith 1992). The functional change at kelp and wood parcels \n\nwas strikingly similar, albeit followed the distinct time scales from disturbance. At \n\nboth parcels, we observed an early increase on the proportion of omnivores due to \n\nopportunist colonization. At sediments where no significant organic input was \n\nobserved, there were minimal changes on the abundance of surface and subsurface \n\ndeposit feeders, spatially associated with the persistence of background polychaetes \n\nspecies close to the parcels. The long-term changes in trophic structure were restricted \n\nto sediments under the influence of high organic input, and lasted for over 5 years at \n\nwood parcels.  \n\nMost top-ranked species from both organic falls had isotope signatures \n\nindicative of higher nutrition on detritus, reflecting species-specific preferences but \n\nwith wide ranges of dependence at a variety of organic sources. Cumella sp. A \n\nappeared to feed primarily on kelp at 0.25 y but Cumacea sp. K had isotopic \n\n\n\n 45 \n\ncomposition indicative of nutrition from chemoautotrophic production (Fisher et al. \n\n1994, Levin &amp; Michener 2002). At 0.5 y wood parcels the same species had ?13C \n\nsignatures indicating a source of chemoautotrophic biomass before any sedimentary \n\nenrichment, possibly through sulfur-oxidizing bacteria filaments growing on wood \n\nsurfaces (Ruby et al. 1987, Laurent et al. 2009). Chemosynthetic energy sources could \n\nbe particularly important to opportunist organisms prior to the sedimentary \n\nenrichment around the parcels, as observed for detritivores growing on forest litter \n\n(McLeod &amp; Wing 2007). The other specimens at wood parcels had wide isotope \n\nsignatures suggesting nutrition on many different organic sources and occupying high \n\ntrophic positions, with low contribution from chemosynthetic carbon. Low \n\ndependence on chemosynthesis has been observed at reducing habitats that have \n\ngreater availability of organic sources (Levin et al. 2000). Two dorvilleid species had \n\nslightly distinct contributions of wood detritus to their diet, probably a consequence of \n\na patchy supply of organic carbon around the parcels. Xylophaga juveniles had a \n\nstronger contribution of wood carbon to their diet but the adults had increased \n\nbacterial carbon, possibly reflecting the signatures of their symbiotic bacteria (Distel \n\n&amp; Roberts 1997, Nishimoto et al. 2009). \n\nBiodiversity comparisons among deep-sea habitats face inherent difficulties \n\nassociated with the taxonomy of poorly known faunas, and comparisons between \n\nstudies that used very distinct sampling methodologies. We also could not reject our \n\nsecond hypothesis of low levels of species overlap between wood, kelp and the \n\nmacrofauna of other reducing habitats. The macrofauna at kelp and wood falls \n\nexhibited higher taxonomic affinity with nearby whale-falls than to other deep-sea \n\nchemosynthetic communities, although this could easily be a location effect (the \n\nwhale fall was only ~100 m away, while seeps and vents were 100\u2019s to 1000\u2019s of km \n\n\n\n 46 \n\naway). For example, cumaceans were top-ranked individuals at our organic falls and \n\nat whale carcasses, but were not found at the San Clemente seep (Smith et al. in prep). \n\nVent taxa present on kelp and wood falls were mostly restricted to polychaete \n\npredators and microbial mat grazers, such as polynoids and some dorvilleids, which \n\nalso occur at whale carcasses and Californian seeps (Smith &amp; Baco 2003, Levin \n\n2005). The dorvilleids found at kelp and wood parcels typically colonize whale-falls \n\nand other sulfide-rich sediments, including the nearby San Clemente seep (Levin et al. \n\n2006, Smith et al. in prep). The high number of dorvilleid species at wood parcels was \n\nsurprising, with 6 species representing at least 3 genera often found at seeps, vents \n\nand whale-falls, and suggesting that wood islands may create a complex of niches for \n\nthis group (Baco-Taylor &amp; Smith 2003, Levin et al. 2003). The longer persistence of \n\nwood-falls and their stronger organic enrichment compared to kelps may further \n\nfacilitate the colonization of species attracted to sulfide around these parcels (Smith et \n\nal. 1989, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). The wood also attracted a few Idas washingtonia, \n\nwhich contains chemoautrophic endosymbionts, and occurs in abundance at whale \n\nfalls (Deming et al. 1997, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). \n\nThe colonization by seep and whale fall species suggests that wood islands \n\nhave low potential to sustain chemosynthesis, but demonstrates that these parcels can \n\nincrease the local heterogeneity of the deep seafloor for long periods of time. It is \n\nhard to estimate the frequency of occurrence of such organic islands across deep-sea \n\nhabitats, but it is clear that they provide food and substrate to deep-sea opportunists \n\n(Wolff 1979, Kiel &amp; Goedert 2006, McLeod &amp; Wing 2007). The frequent \n\nbiogeographic occurrence of these habitats are supported by recent explorations in the \n\nWest Pacific that have collected an abundant wood associated fauna with several new \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nspecimens at depths far from continental margins (Pailleret et al. 2007, Samadi et al. \n\n2009).  \n\nThe frequent occurrence of wood and kelp falls, together with whale carcasses \n\nand other organic habitats may increase regional species diversity and favor stepping \n\nstone dispersal for some species (Levin et al. 2001, Snelgrove &amp; Smith 2002, Van \n\nDover et al. 2002). Our study indicates that wood falls create organic rich islands that \n\nare exploited by both opportunists and a few specialized taxa, evidencing the role of \n\npatch disturbance and habitat variability in maintaining regional diversity (Snelgrove \n\n&amp; Smith 2002). Wood falls host many dorvilleid polychaetes, which are typical of \n\nseeps and vents and are a remarkable species rich group in whale falls (Smith &amp; Baco \n\n2003). Bathymodiolin mussels show specialization on organic falls and are abundant \n\non several reducing habitats (e.g. seeps and vents). Molecular and phylogenetic \n\nanalyzes indicate that the high diversity of the Bathymodiolinae and their successful \n\ncolonization of seeps and vents may have resulted from their ability to exploit wide \n\ngeochemical conditions at organic islands (Fisher et al. 1987, Distel et al. 2000, Jones \n\net al. 2006, Lorion et al. 2009). Hence, the strongest evidence for wood falls to \n\nincrease regional levels of biodiversity comes from the fact that multiple species \n\ncolonize these habitats from other areas. Consequently, wood falls may increase \n\nhabitat and population connectivity across wide ocean basins (Smith et al. 1989, \n\nDistel et al. 2000, Van Dover et al. 2002, Kritzer &amp; Sale 2006), as suggested from \n\ntheir wide distribution and the fact they sustain organic rich islands for extended \n\nperiods of time. \n\n \n\n2.5. Conclusions \n\n \n\n\n\n 48 \n\nThis study showed that kelp and wood falls contribute to the heterogeneity of \n\nhabitats in the deep-sea, as evidenced by the colonization of several organic-\n\nenrichment species not present on ambient deep-sea communities. The long-term \n\norganic enrichment created by wood falls increased macrofaunal colonization for \n\nseveral opportunist and specialized species, with evidence of mass effects dynamics \n\nfor wood-borers. As a result of abundant organic sources and low sulfide levels, \n\nchemoautotrophy is limited in sediments around wood falls. Wood and kelp falls host \n\na limited number of species that overlap with vents and seeps, with higher similarity \n\nwith whale carcasses at similar ocean depths, but this could be a result of low spatial \n\nisolation. Our study gives support that wood falls create favorable habitats for the \n\nstepping stone dispersal of species adapted to use these low sulfide but organic rich \n\nparcels in deep-sea areas. \n\n \n \n2.6.

Infaunal community structure and succession during \n\nthe sulfophilic stage of a whale carcass in the deep NE Pacific \n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nAlthough natural and experimental deep-sea whale falls have been studied in several \n\nocean basins, the impact of whale falls on sediment macrofaunal community structure \n\nhas rarely been studied. Here we evaluate macrofaunal community structure and \n\nsuccession around a 30-ton deep-sea whale-fall artificially implanted at 1670 m in the \n\nSanta Cruz Basin (SCr; NE Pacific). This study focused on macrofaunal community \n\npatterns from 4.5 to 6.8 y after carcass deployment in order to evaluate: (1) patterns of \n\norganic enrichment around the whale-fall sediments; (2) spatial and temporal patterns \n\nof macrofaunal species structure and (3) level of species overlap with other artificial \n\nand natural reducing habitats at similar depths on the Californian margin. Sediment \n\norganic enrichment around the whale-fall during the period studied was highly \n\npatchy, with some sediments adjacent the whale fall exhibiting intense organic \n\nloading (11% organic carbon by weight). Macrofaunal abundance was highly elevated \n\nfrom 4.5 to 6.8 y, and was dominated by enrichment opportunist and sulfophilic \n\nspecies. Dorvilleids, ampharetids and cumaceans accounted for over 50% of \n\nmacrofaunal abundance nearby the whale-fall (0 \u2013 0.5 m) at all times sampled. \n\nBacterial mats were abundant over the sediment surface for over 6.8 y, indicating the \n\npresence of pore-water sulfides and organic enrichment, and indicating that the \n\nsulfophilic stage had started by 4.5 y. The macrofaunal community was composed of \n\nchemoautotrophic-symbiont-hosting and heterotrophic species grazing sulfur-\n\noxidizing bacterial mats. Whale-fall sediments harbor many species and trophic types \n\nnot present in background sediments, and significantly increase beta diversity for at \n\nleast 7 yrs. There were low levels of species overlap between the whale-fall, cold \n\nseeps and hydrothermal vents, explained by differences in biogeochemistry and food \n\nwebs among these habitats. The sediment macrofauna around the SCr whale-fall was \n\nmore diverse than in other similar habitats at cold seeps and hydrothermal vents, \n\nindicating that whale-falls may be significant oases of enhanced alpha diversity in the \n\ndeep-sea. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nNekton carcasses (e.g. fishes, dolphins, whales) provide an important source \n\nof energy to the deep sea, introducing large quantities of fresh organic material into a \n\nfood-poor environment (Stockton &amp; DeLaca 1982, Smith 1985, 1986, Smith &amp; \n\nDemopoulos 2005). The arrival of a carcass of the largest living animal on Earth at \n\nthe deep-sea floor has received considerable attention and the succession of organisms \n\nexploiting whale-carcasses have been studied in numerous deep-sea and shallow \n\nwater sites (Smith 1985, Naganuma et al. 1996, Smith et al. 1998, Smith &amp; Baco \n\n2003, Goffredi et al. 2004, Fujiwara et al. 2007). The amount of carbon that is \n\nexported as whale-detritus is lower than the flux of particulate organic carbon (POC) \n\nto deep-sea oceans, but dead whales sink as enormous organic-rich packages that \n\ndisturb a very limited area of the sea-bottom (Smith 2006). For example, the seabed \n\nimmediately underlying a typical whale fall (i.e. roughly 50 m2), can experience the \n\nequivalent of 2000 yr of background POC flux in a single pulse of organic enrichment \n\n(Smith &amp; Baco 2003). Consequently, whale carcasses provide an immense and very \n\nrich source of labile organic matter to the food limited deep-sea ecosystems. This \n\nenormous food bonanza attracts numerous macro- and megafaunal organisms that \n\nexploit the rich organic sources for years to decades (Smith et al. 1998, Baco-Taylor \n\n&amp; Smith 2003, Smith 2006). \n\nModern whale carcasses in the deep sea host a dense and species-rich \n\nmacrofaunal assemblage attached to bone surfaces and living in the underlying soft \n\nsediments (Bennett et al. 1994, Smith et al. 1998, Baco-Taylor &amp; Smith 2003, Smith \n\n&amp; Baco 2003, Goffredi et al. 2004). Experimental studies on the Californian slope \n\nrevealed that whale carcasses typically support a diverse succession of macrofaunal \n\nassemblages that include: i) a first stage of mobile scavengers; ii) an enrichment \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n61 \n\nopportunist stage; iii) a sulfophilic or chemoautotrophic stage and iv) a reef stage \n\n(Smith &amp; Baco 2003). Along the successional stages, considerable attention has been \n\ngiven to the epifaunal macrofauna associated with the whale bones, revealing that \n\nwhale skeletons can harbor the highest local species richness of any deep-sea hard-\n\nsubstrata habitats, such as cold seeps and vents (Baco-Taylor &amp; Smith 2003). \n\nHighlights of the extreme richness associated with these habitats comes from the \n\nlimited number of overlapping species inhabiting similar whale-fall ecosystems, \n\nconsidering that a relatively limited number of whale-falls have been studied globally \n\n(Smith &amp; Baco 2003, Fujiwara et al. 2007). The high number of whale-fall specialists \n\ndescribed recently further suggests that much of the biodiversity associated with these \n\nhabitats remains to be discovered, and that carcasses of large animals may have \n\npromoted evolutionary reducing habitats in the deep sea for long periods of time \n\n(Dahlgren et al. 2004, Glover et al. 2005b, Kiel &amp; Goedert 2006). \n\nWhale skeletons generate organic-rich conditions and sustain a reducing \n\nhabitat for years in the deep-sea. The long-term persistence of reducing conditions at \n\nwhale carcasses create habitat for specialized species that depend on chemosynthesis \n\nfor their nutrition, which may increase the overlap of species between whale skeletons \n\nand other chemosynthetic habitats (Smith et al. 1989). The whale fall chemosynthesis \n\nis principally based on anaerobic microbial degradation of bone lipids and on the \n\ndegradation of organic carbon in sediments around the carcass; releasing high levels \n\nof hydrogen sulfide (Goffredi et al. 2008, Treude et al. 2009). Biogeochemical \n\nprocesses in a whale fall can sustain similar chemosynthetic conditions to other rich \n\nreducing habitats such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents; and taxonomic affinities \n\namong species inhabiting whale carcasses and chemoautotrophic-based communities \n\nsupports the similar ecological niche found between them (Smith &amp; Baco 2003, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n62 \n\nTreude et al. 2009). The broad range of ecological niches present at whale carcasses \n\nattracts organisms that host chemoautotrophic symbionts, including whale-fall \n\n\u201cspecialists\u201d, heterotrophic opportunists and also background species (Baco-Taylor &amp; \n\nSmith 2003, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). \n\nThe importance of chemosynthetic food-webs at many reducing habitats in the \n\ndeep-sea and the encounter of chemosynthesis-based species colonizing both whales, \n\nseeps and vents, led to the stepping stone hypothesis that whale carcasses serve as \n\nintermediate habitats for the dispersal of vent and seep species (Smith et al. 1989). \n\nOverlapped species between whale-vent-seep habitats include both specialized \n\norganisms that first evolved at a specific habitat and then invaded others, and other \n\ngeneralist and opportunist species that are able to exploit rich organic conditions over \n\nvast areas (Bennett et al. 1994, Van Dover et al. 2002). For example, molecular \n\nevidence suggests that the Bathymodiolinae (Bivalvia: Mytilidae), which are \n\nsymbiont-containing mussels dependent on chemosynthesis, diversified first on whale \n\nand wood remains before invading vents and seeps (Fisher 1999, Distel et al. 2000, \n\nVan Dover 2000). On the other hand, molecular data from distinct groups evidenced \n\nthat many evolved first at seep or vent habitats and then colonized deep-sea organic \n\nhabitats (Baco-Taylor et al. 1999, Shank et al. 1999). Phylogenetic patterns also \n\nsuggests that many overlapping species are ubiquitous to whale falls, wood islands, \n\nvents and seeps, which also supports the stepping stone hypothesis (Distel et al. 2000, \n\nVan Dover et al. 2002, Smith &amp; Baco 2003, Lorion et al. 2009). However, whale \n\nfalls, hydrothermal vents and cold seeps each harbor many endemic species that have \n\nspecific physiological and reproductive adaptations to its environment (Dahlgren et al. \n\n2004, Glover et al. 2005b). Until sufficient sampling and experimentation is carried \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n63 \n\non these habitats, knowledge about ecology and the evolutionary potential of these \n\nhabitats will be incomplete. \n\nThe ecology of epifaunal organisms associated with whale carcasses has been \n\nstudied in a few sites, but the effort to study the macrofaunal community thriving at \n\nsediments nearby whale skeletons has been limited (Naganuma et al. 1996, Smith et \n\nal. 1998). A whale fall study sampled macrofaunal communities in sediments around \n\nnatural whale skeletons in the Pacific, where at the time of sampling the carcasses had \n\nbeen in the seafloor for at least 4 years (Smith et al. 1998). The macrofaunal \n\ncommunity at these carcasses were at an advanced stage in the predicted ecological \n\nsuccession, where most of the whale soft tissue and organic matter had been \n\ndecomposed, with very weak evidence of sulfides within the sediments (Smith et al. \n\n1998). Consequently, the number of specialized organisms in the macrofaunal \n\ncommunity could not be well evaluated, although a species rich bone-associated fauna \n\nwas described from the same carcass (Bennett et al. 1994, Smith et al. 1998). \n\nTherefore, long term studies focusing on the sediment macrofauna at whale falls \n\nalong variable stages of succession and biogeochemical conditions can help to \n\nevaluate long-term patterns on community succession and structure, and further \n\ninvestigate levels of species overlap with other chemosynthetic ecosystems. \n\nThis study will focus at the sediment macrofauna around the Santa Cruz whale \n\ncarcass, which was artificially implanted at 1800 m depth in 1998. Following \n\ndeployment, the whale carcass was revisited and sampled at 0.1, 1.5, 4.5, 5.8 and 6.8 \n\nyears, corresponding to the most comprehensive and long-term ecological study of a \n\nwhole whale carcass to date. In this study, we will focus on the macrofauna \n\ncommunity at sediments around the whale carcass during the sulfophilic stage (i.e. \n\nfrom 4.5 to 6.8 years after the whale implantation). Therefore, patterns of community \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n64 \n\nstructure, succession and species overlap will be evaluated in sediments directly \n\ninfluenced by the organic impact from the whale carcass, and available data from \n\nsediment geochemistry will be used to support our observations (Treude et al. 2009). \n\nWe also compared levels of species overlap between the whale fall macrofauna to \n\nother organic islands (i.e. kelp and wood parcels) artificially implanted at similar \n\nocean depths nearby, and to the San Clemente seep macrofauna situated about 200 \n\nKm southeast. We aimed to address the following hypothesis: \n\n \n\n1) Whale falls create sulfophilic habitats with intense organic enrichment in \n\nsediments nearby, which will affect the macrofaunal community structure and \n\nsuccession;  \n\n2) A low degree of species overlap will be observed between the Santa Cruz whale \n\nfall and other assemblages at southern California seeps, kelp falls and wood falls \n\nat similar ocean depths.  \n\n \n\n3.2. Materials and methods \n\nStudy site and sampling \n\n \n\nThe whale fall was experimentally implanted in Santa Cruz Basin, California \n\n(33\u00b027\u2019N, 119\u00b022\u2019W, 1675 m, bottom temperature ~ 4\u00baC, bottom-water oxygen \n\nconcentration 260 \u00b5M) in April of 1998 (Figure 1.1-Point A). It is a carcass of a 13-m \n\nmature gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus Gray, 1864), which weighted \n\napproximately 30 x 103 kg at the time it was sunk (C. Smith, pers. communication). \n\nThis whale carcass was visited on multiple occasions since its deployment, but this \n\nstudy focus on the macrofauna community at sediments from 4.5 y, 5.8 y and 6.8y \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n65 \n\nafter whale implantation. Sediment samples were collected using the remotely \n\noperated vehicle (ROV) Tiburon during three cruises (Oct.2002, Mar.2004 and Feb-\n\nMar.2005) on board the R/V Western Flyer, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research \n\nInstitute (Appendix 3A). Sampling cores were taken from five randomly radiating \n\nsampling transects starting immediately close to the carcass, and samples were \n\ncollected at distances of 0, 1, 3, and 9 m from the whale. The sediment macrofauna \n\nwas sampled with 3-5 replicate tube cores from each distance during each cruise. The \n\nbackground macrofauna was sampled during 3 distinct cruises in 2002, 2004 and \n\n2005, totaling 17 replicate tube cores distant at least 9-100 meters from any organic \n\nisland (i.e. whale-fall, kelp or wood parcels). Corers sampled at 9 m from 2005 were \n\npooled with the background thus increasing our temporal replication. Based on \n\nmacrofaunal abundance and species composition, there was no evidence of any \n\ninfluence from the whale carcass at distances of over 3 m in 2005. All cores assigned \n\nto macrofauna analysis were sliced on board at 0-1, 1-5 and 5-10 depth intervals and \n\npreserved in 4% seawater buffered formalin. Replicate cores were also taken at each \n\ndistance to be analyzed for total organic carbon and nitrogen. \n\n \n\nLaboratory analysis \n\n \n\nIn laboratory, samples were sieved in a 300\u00b5m mesh and all organisms were \n\nstained, sorted and identified at the lowest attainable taxonomic level. Distribution of \n\ntaxa among feeding guilds helped to distinguish temporal and spatial patterns of \n\ntrophic succession around the whale-fall (Fauchald &amp; Jumars 1979, Kukert &amp; Smith \n\n1992). Sediment samples for organic carbon and nitrogen analysis were acidified to \n\nremove carbonates by repeated additions of sulfurous acid (8 % v/v) until no \n\neffervescence was observed (Verardo et al. 1990) and then analyzed using a Perkin-\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n66 \n\nElmer 2400 CHN Elemental Analyzer, with a limit of detection of 1 mg and 1.2 mg \n\nfor C and N, respectively, while the precision was 0.3 % and 0.4 % for C and N, \n\nrespectively. CHN standards were made with acetanilide and blanks were made of \n\nboth non-acidified and acidified cups, both giving minor signals of TOC and TN. \n\nA few top-ranked macrofaunal organisms at representative stages of whale-fall \n\ncommunity succession were selected for stable isotope analysis. Selected individuals \n\nwere sorted using methanol-cleaned forceps and specimens were then rinsed and \n\ncleaned of attached debris in DI water. Calcareous shelled organisms were decalcified \n\nwith phosphoric acid and placed in pre-weighed tin cups for overnight drying (35-40 \n\n\u00baC). Multiple individuals of the same species Calcareous shelled organisms were \n\ndecalcified with phosphoric acid and placed in pre-weighed tin cups for overnight \n\ndrying (35-40 \u00baC). Multiple individuals of single species were combined in one \n\nsample to make up the necessary dry weight of 0.5-2 mg for analysis. Samples were \n\ncombusted in a Eurovector elemental analyzer and resulting N2 and CO2 gases were \n\nseparated by gas chromatography and admitted into an isotope ratio mass \n\nspectrometer (IRMS) for determination of 15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios (reproducibility: \n\n\u00b10.5 \u2030 for ?15N and \u00b10.2 \u2030 for ? 13C). Macrofaunal C-isotopic ratios were measured \n\nagainst a Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) standard for ?13C and atmospheric nitrogen for \n\n?15N. Results are expressed as delta (?) notation representing the relative difference \n\nbetween sample and standard, where ?X (\u2030) = [(Rsample/Rstandard)-1] x 103, where \n\nR=15N/14N or R=14C/13C.  \n\nMacroinfaunal organisms were fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution, potentially \n\nintroducing artifacts in stable isotope values, although shifts in carbon isotope ratio \n\nare usually small compared to the wide natural C variability in marine food sources \n\n(Fry &amp; Sherr 1989, Edwards et al. 2002, Sarakinos et al. 2002). In this study, we \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n67 \n\ncorrected for preservation artifacts by adding 1\u2030 to ? 13C (Baco-Taylor 2002, \n\nSarakinos et al. 2002, Demopoulos et al. 2007). Trophic shift boxes from potential \n\norganic matter sources at the whale-fall helped to determine organisms\u2019 food sources \n\n(Fry 2006). Trophic changes of +3 \u2030 were added to the range of ?15N values \n\nobtained for each organic matter source (DeNiro &amp; Epstein 1978, Minagawa &amp; Wada \n\n1984, Fisher et al. 1994). Species that exclusively use a particular organic-matter \n\nsource for nutrition are expected to fall within the appropriate trophic-shift box. \n\n \n\nVideo Analysis \n\n \n\nPrior to sampling transects, the ROV Tiburon flew over the carcass along \n\ntransects paralleling the long axis of the skeleton.  Surveys were conducted at the \n\nbeginning of the first dive series to avoid ROV disturbance of bacterial mats and \n\nsediments prior to the survey. Digital pictures were taken from the camera oriented \n\nvertically downward and helped to estimate bacterial mat and black sediment cover at \n\nthe whale carcass and on the surrounding sediments. ROV altitude was held constant \n\nat approximately 2 m during transects, and the camera was fired to obtain overlapping \n\nimages. Visual maps of the whale fall were created in 2004 and 2005 from selected \n\nimages that were combined in a mosaic using the computer software Inkscape \n\n(Freeware). Overlapping portions of images were adjusted according to identifiable \n\nbone and sediment features, and images were sequentially stretched to correct for \n\nparallax. The image mosaic was calibrated from images that contained a known scale, \n\nusing the computer software ImageJ (NIH, USA). An absolute length scale was \n\nobtained from 10-cm diameter circular scale markers dropped on the sediment surface \n\naround the whale carcass by the ROV. In images with no visual scale, similar \n\nstructures were overlaid at the sediment-water interface (e.g., bone outlines, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n68 \n\nbioturbation features, sessile benthos) in successive images, and laser scale markers \n\nwere used to calibrate length scales throughout the mosaic. Errors in length estimates \n\ndue to scale calibration at the sediment-water interface are estimated to be &lt;10%. \n\n Estimates of absolute areal coverage of microbial mats, and black (presumably \n\nsulphidic) sediments were for the sediment-water interface within a 50 cm radius of \n\nthe skeleton.  We restricted mat measurements to the 50-cm radius because video \n\nsurveys indicated that all mats occurred within 50 cm of the skeleton in both 2004 and \n\n2005. In one area, black sediments extended 60 to 70 cm from the skeleton, but this \n\nwas a very small proportion of the total black-sediment area. To facilitate mapping, \n\nthe carcass was divided in three regions: head, thorax and lumbar.  The percentage \n\ncover in each area was subsequently used to estimate the absolute area of sediment \n\ncoverage in each section from the total sediment area measured in each region in 2004 \n\nand 2005. \n\nThe protrusion of bones above the sediment-water interface and their irregular \n\nshapes hindered estimates of mat area on the skeleton. Thus, we could only estimate \n\npercentage cover of bone plan areas by bacterial mats, and skeleton plan area.  The \n\nuse of a real scale was hindered by very variable angles of observation and due to the \n\nbones arrangement above the seafloor. Direct comparisons of individual bones \n\nbetween cruises were also generally not possible. To compare mat coverage between \n\n2004 and 2005, bones were grouped by type, including mandibles/maxillae, head \n\nbones, scapulas, ribs and vertebrae. Vertebrae were subsequently subdivided in \n\nthoracic, lumbar and caudal vertebrae. \n\n \n\nStatistical methods \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n69 \n\nTotal faunal abundance, faunal similarity and diversity were compared among \n\ndistances and time for each treatment type. Total densities around treatments and in \n\nambient sediments were examined with One-Way ANOVA if normality of variances \n\nwas present. If homogeneity of variances was not attained, a non-parametric Kruskal-\n\nWallis test was performed. For significant ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis results, post-\n\nhoc tests were used to examine difference in means [statistical package BioEstat? \n\n(Zar 1996)]. Species diversity was evaluated for pooled replicate cores at each \n\ndistance sampled (n=1-5) due to the low density of metazoans. Hulbert\u2019s rarefaction \n\ncurves (ESn) were used to compare species diversity between treatments (see Chapter \n\n1). Values of ESn were compared at n=10, n=25 and n=50, where possible. Near \n\ntreatment samples were compared at higher n values, because these samples contained \n\nhigher abundances and were particularly interesting as they were directly influenced \n\nby the treatments. Background replicate cores (n=17) from 2002, 2004 and 2005 were \n\ncombined to calculate a composite diversity from the background community; with \n\nconfidence limits calculated from pooled cores. A one-tailed 95% confidence interval \n\nobtained from rarefaction \u201cknots\u201d obtained in each pooled sample was used to \n\ndetermine statistical significance [Chapter 2; (Smith 1986)]. Pielou\u2019s evenness (J\u2019) is \n\ngiven to provide further information on community structure (Clarke &amp; Warwick \n\n2001). The relative abundance of trophic guilds at each period sampled was integrated \n\nby distance in order to increase the power of statistical analyses. Samples from 0 m \n\nand 0.5 m were compared against the background in order to evaluate changes in \n\ntrophic structure nearby the whale-fall; and examined with ANOVA or Kruskal-\n\nWallis. \n\nCluster analyses and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) based on \n\nspecies-abundance data from standardized quantitative samples [PRIMER v6, (Clarke \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n70 \n\n&amp; Gorley 2006)] were used to compare community structure across distance and time. \n\nSquare-root transformations were used prior to multivariate analysis in order to \n\nbalance the importance of common and rare species (Clarke &amp; Warwick 2001). \n\nClustering and ordination analyses were often combined to verify mutual consistency. \n\nAnalysis of similarities (ANOSIM) was performed on standardized quantitative \n\nsamples to determine significant differences between groups (distance and time) and \n\ndissimilarity percentages identified species contributions to these patterns (SIMPER \n\nanalysis, (Clarke &amp; Warwick 2001). \n\nLevels of species overlap between the whale-fall, kelp, wood, and other \n\nreducing habitats were restricted to direct comparisons of relatively abundant species \n\n(i.e., over 1% rel. ab.) collected within 0.5 m of the whale carcass, excluding species \n\nsampled at ambient sediments (i.e. total of 17 background cores from 2002, 2004 and \n\n2004). We also excluded rare species (less than 1% rel. abundance) from our \n\ncomparisons in order to account for difficulties in taxonomic identification and \n\nundersampling biases. Comparisons of species overlap with other published studies \n\nwere carried out at the genus and species level in order to account for differences in \n\ntaxonomic identification between studies. \n\n \n\n3.3. Results \n\nOrganic enrichment around the whale-fall \n\nWe found evidence of highly patchy organic enrichment in surface sediments \n\naround the whale during the period analyzed (Fig. 3.1). At 4.5y, sedimentary organic \n\ncarbon was within background levels but reached 11% TOC at 0 m, evidencing the \n\nmeter-scale patchiness of organic enrichment around the carcass (Fig. 3.1). Total \n\norganic nitrogen (TON) was slightly higher nearby the carcass, but with no significant \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n71 \n\ndifferences from background sediments (Fig. 3.1). The temporal patterns of TOC and \n\nTON suggests that the organic enrichment stage in the whale carcass had finished by \n\n4.5 y (Smith &amp; Baco 2003).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.1. Left: TOC (\u00b11SD) in surface sediments around the whale fall. Right: surface TON \n(\u00b11SD). Background values (\u00b11SD) displayed in shaded gray. \n  \n \n\nMacrofauna density, composition and patterns of succession \n\n \n\nMacrofaunal abundance showed marked spatial and temporal differences in \n\nsediments around the Santa Cruz (SCr) whale fall. Macrofaunal density decreased \n\nsignificantly towards background sediments, with spatial differences being observed \n\nat all periods sampled. At all periods, macrofaunal density at 0 m was over 10 times \n\nbackground values (1269 \u00b1 189 ind. m-2; p<0.05; Fig. 3.2, Table 3.1). At 4.5y, \n\nmacrofaunal abundance at 1 m was also higher than background sediments (Kruskal-\n\nWallis; Table 3.1). Significant higher abundances at 0 to 1 meters from the carcass \n\nwere still evident after 5.8 and 6.8 years of deployment (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.05, \n\nFig. 3.2, Table 3.1). From 4.5 to 6.8 years, macrofaunal density was still increasing, \n\nbeing over 27 times background values in the last period (Fig. 3.2). At all periods \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n72 \n\nevaluated, macrofaunal abundance over 1 m was not different from background \n\nsediments (Fig. 3.2). \n\n \nFigure 3.2. Total macrofaunal abundance around the SCr Whale in 2002, 2004 and 2005. \nBackground density (\u00b1 1SE) in shaded gray. \n \n \nTable 3.1. P values from Kruskal-Wallis test of total macrofaunal abundances between 4.5y \nand 6.8y. \n \n\n \n \n\nPolychaetes and cumaceans predominantly dominated the macrofauna around \n\nthe carcass (0-1 m) during the three periods sampled (Fig 3.3). At 4.5y, dorvilleid and \n\nampharetids polychaetes were massively present in the nearest 0 meters, representing \n\nnear 80% of the macrofaunal individuals (Fig. 3.3). Two dorvilleid species \n\n(Ophryotrocha sp.A and Ophryotrocha platykephale) were among the top-ranked \n\nspecies at 0 m after 4.5y (Table 3.2). A new species of gastropod (Hyalogyrina n.sp.) \n\nwas another dominant species at 0 m, and is extremely abundant in the whale carcass \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n73 \n\n(Smith &amp; Baco 2003). The chemoautotrophic symbiont-containing mytilid bivalve \n\nIdas washingtonia was an abundant species at 0 m and up to 3 meters from the \n\ncarcass at 4.5 y. At 0.5 meters, Cumacean sp. K was the dominant species (>50% \n\nrelative abundance), together with dorvilleids, ampharetids and cirratulids (Fig. 3.3). \n\nThe macrofauna over 3 m at 4.5y was typically composed of background species, \n\ndominated by cirratulid polychaetes. At 5.8 years, dorvilleids and cumaceans \n\ndominated the macrofauna at 0 m, with ampharetids also abundant at 0.5 m (Fig. 3.3). \n\nThe dominant species at 0 m were the dorvilleids Ophryotrocha (2 spp.) and \n\nParougia sp., and two cumacean species, which all accounted for over 60% of all \n\nindividuals (Table 3.2). At 1 m, the macrofauna was dominated by cirratulids typical \n\nof background sediments, but ampharetids, dorvilleids, and vesicomyd bivalves \n\nreached high abundances (Fig. 3.3). Sediments at 3 m exhibited a particular mixture \n\nof background (cirratulids and cossurids) and opportunist species (Parougia sp. A and \n\ncumaceans; Fig. 3.3). After 6.8 years, the macrofauna within 0 - 0.5 m meters was \n\nclosely similar, with dorvilleids, cumaceans and ampharetids being the dominant \n\norganisms (Fig. 3.3). The top-ranked species at 0 m included three dorvilleid species, \n\ntwo ampharetids and Cumacean sp. K (Table 3.2).  Sediments at 1 meter had a lower \n\nproportion of opportunistic species if compared to the previous period (5.8 y), \n\nindicating succession towards background conditions (Fig. 3.3). Background species \n\ndominated sediments over 3 meters from the whale fall, but some sediment patches \n\ncontained species not typically found on background sediments (Fig. 3.3). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n74 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3. Macrofaunal composition around the whale fall at 4.5y, 5.8y and 6.8y. \n \n\nMany of the dominant species exhibited significant increases in abundance \n\nnearby the whale fall but were not found on background areas, which is characteristic \n\nof disturbance opportunistic species (Grassle &amp; Grassle 1974). From the total of 14 \n\ndorvilleid species identified in sediments nearby the whale carcass, at least 4 species \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n75 \n\nresponded opportunistically to the arrival of the whale carcass (Table 3.2). The genus \n\nOphryotrocha included at least 3 species that were particularly dominant up to 0.5 \n\nmeters and cumaceans were also among the dominant species up to 1 meter from the \n\nwhale-fall but not at background sediments. Two ampharetid species were also \n\nopportunist species that were exploiting disturbance conditions nearby the whale fall \n\n(Table 3.2). \n\n \n\nTable 3.2. Top-ranked species at 0 m sediments from the macrofauna at 4.5, 5.8 and 6.8 y. \nDominant species from background samples also indicated. Density in (ind. m-2 (\u00b11 SE). \n \n\n \n\n \n\nAreas with high dominance of opportunist species within 0 \u2013 0.5 m of the \n\nwhale-fall showed significant decreases on community evenness (J\u2019; Fig. 3.4). At \n\n4.5y, J\u2019 was significantly lower in sediments within 0 - 1 m from the whale-fall, due \n\nto the dominance of dorvilleids, ampharetids (0 m) and cumaceans (1m, Fig. 3.3; \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n76 \n\nANOVA, F=4.15, d.f.= 2, p=0.027). At 5.8 y, sediments at 0 m were still heavily \n\ncolonized by opportunistic polychaetes and cumaceans and presented significant \n\nlower evenness than areas over 0.5 m and background sediments (Fig. 3.3., ANOVA, \n\nF=7.55, d.f.= 5, p=0.002). The same pattern was observed after 6.8 y, with 0 m \n\nsediments showing lower community evenness than 0.5 m and areas further away \n\nfrom the whale-fall (ANOVA, F=6.11, d.f.= 4, p=0.001). Community evenness also \n\nvaried markedly from 4.5y to 6.8 y at sediments nearby the whale-fall (0 - 1 m). At 1 \n\nm, J\u2019 was significantly lower at 4.5 y if compared to the other periods (5.8 y and 6.8 \n\ny) and background areas (ANOVA, F=3.07, d.f.= 3, p=0.044). Sediments at 0 m had \n\nhigher dominance than background areas during all periods studied (ANOVA, \n\nF=8.00, d.f.= 3, p=0.001). The spatial and temporal patterns on macrofaunal \n\ncommunity evenness described above, clearly indicates that areas within 1 m from the \n\nwhale-fall were strongly disturbed at 4.5 y, but not after 5.8 y when significant \n\nchanges in J\u2019 were mainly observed at 0 m. \n\n \n \nFigure 3.4. Macrofaunal community evenness (Pielou\u2019s J\u2019) at the Santa Cruz whale-fall. \n\n \n\nAlthough significant spatial and temporal differences in community evenness \n\nwere observed, macrofaunal diversity nearby the whale-fall was generally higher than \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n77 \n\nbackground sediments between 4.5 y and 6.8 y (Fig. 3.5). At 4.5 y, diversity at 1 m \n\nwas significantly lower than background sediments (Fig. 3.5-a). However, 0 m \n\nsediments and areas further 3 m from the whale-fall at 4.5y had similar or higher \n\ndiversity levels than background (Fig. 3.5-a). At 5.8y, diversity at 1 m markedly \n\nincreased if compared to the previous period and nearby the whale-fall (0 - 1m), \n\ndiversity was comparable to background sediments (Fig. 3.5 \u2013b). In the last period \n\nanalyzed, levels of diversity were higher than background at all distances sampled \n\n(Fig. 3.5-c). There was evidence of a temporal increase on species diversity around \n\nthe whale-fall (0 m), from 4.5 y to 6.8 y (Fig. 3.6). The temporal increase in species \n\ndiversity nearby the whale-fall was concurrent with the recolonization of previously \n\ndisturbed areas by background species and possibly the arrival of new and rare \n\nspecies. At the two latter periods, levels of diversity also increased from 0 m to 3 m \n\n(Fig. 3.6), likely in response to the augmented richness in those areas which were \n\ncolonized by whale-fall and background species. The augmented diversity towards \n\nlatter stages of succession (6.8 y) supports a change on the habitat structure within the \n\ncontinuous of a slightly disturbed community (2002) to a more species rich fauna in \n\n2005 (Fig. 3.6). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n78 \n\n \nFigure 3.5.

Hulbert rarefaction diversity at 0 m sediments in the SCr whale-fall after 4.5y, \n5.8y and 6.8y. \n \n\n \n\nTrophic group analysis \n\n  \n\n There were significant changes on trophic-group dominance between the \n\nwhale-fall and background sediments, and from 4.5 y to 6.8 y (Fig. 3.7). At 4.5y, \n\nomnivores (OMNI) were significantly more abundant at 0 m (Kruskal-Wallis, \n\nH=47.674, d.f.=11, p=0.001), and subsurface deposit feeders (SSDF) were absent up \n\nto 1 m sediments (p<0.01; Fig. 3.7). At 1 m, cumaceans were responsible for the \n\nhighest proportion of OTHER trophic group, with significant differences from \n\nbackground sediments (Fig. 3.7; Kruskal-Wallis, p=0.02). From 3 meters towards \n\nbackground areas, surface deposit feeders (SDF) predominate, being typically \n\nrepresented by polychaetes. At 5.8 y, the number of OMNI increased from the \n\nprevious period at 0, 0.5 and 1 m sediments, being significantly higher than \n\nbackground (Fig. 3.7; Kruskal-Wallis, H=48.262, d.f.=15, p=0.001). The increase in \n\nOMNI was due to an increased abundance of dorvilleids at sediments within 1 m from \n\nthe whale-fall in these areas if compared to 4.5 y (Fig. 3.3). In the last period (6.8 y), \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n80 \n\nthe dominance of OMNI still predominated in areas within 0 \u2013 0.5 meters from the \n\nwhale-fall (Fig. 3.7; Kruskal-Wallis, H=54.3, d.f.=15, p=0.001). The high number of \n\ncumaceans at 0 m significantly increased the proportion of OTHER relative to \n\nbackground areas (Kruskal-Wallis, p<0.05). The elevated contribution of SDF\u2019s at 0 \u2013 \n\n3 m sediments in all periods sampled was typically due to the presence of ampharetid \n\npolychaetes, whereas cirratulids were the dominant deposit feeders in background \n\nareas. \n\n \nFigure 3.7. Trophic group distribution around the SCr whale-fall during 4.5, 5.8 and 6.8y. \n\n \n\nVideo analysis \u2013 coverage of bones and sediment by bacterial mats \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n81 \n\nBone coverage was estimated from 39 and 46 bones in 2004 and 2005 images, \n\n5.8 and 6.8y respectively (Table 3.3). The lower number of bones observed in 2004 is \n\npartly due to the larger extent of bacterial mats at this time, often preventing a clear \n\ndelineation of bones. Percent bacterial mat coverage as function of bone type and was \n\ngenerally lower in 2005 than in 2004, with statistically significant reductions \n\noccurring on vertebrae (Table 3.3). \n\nHead bones and ribs had the highest and most stable coverage of bacterial \n\nmats   (Table 3.3). These bones were positioned further over the seafloor, which made \n\nthem very visible in all images and possibly prevented the accumulation of sediments \n\nstirred up by ROV activities in 2004. Such sediment deposition was observed on flat \n\nbones near the seafloor, such as jaws and scapulae, probably resulting from sediment \n\nresuspension from the ROV thrusters during the previous dive series in 2002 or 2004.  \n\nThere was a significant difference in bacterial mat coverage on the vertebrae between \n\nyears, with thoracic and caudal vertebrae sustaining a ~30% decrease in mat coverage \n\nfrom 2004 to 2005 (Table 3.3). Pooling of all vertebrae also yielded a significant 31% \n\ndecrease in mat coverage from 2004 to 2005 (p=0.001; Kruskal-Wallis test; Table \n\n3.3). \n\nTable 3.3.

Around the head, bacterial mat decreased \n\nin area by over 45%, and black sediments decreased by ~50% between 2004 and 2005 \n\n(Table 3.4). In the thoracic region, the area of black sediment decreased by over 60% \n\nwhile the area of bacterial mat increased by 45%. This suggests that bacterial mats \n\ncontinued to grow in the thoracic region between 2004 and 2005, i.e., 6.8 years after \n\ncarcass emplacement. The lumbar region had the smallest area of bacterial mat and \n\nblack sediments, with an observed 30% decrease in the area of bacterial mats between \n\n2004 and 2005. Over the whole carcass, the area of bacterial mats was relatively \n\nstable, decreasing slightly (7%) between 2004 and 2005. The decrease in mat \n\ncoverage in the head and lumbar regions was offset by the large increase in mat area \n\nin the thoracic region. However, the area of black sediments patches around the entire \n\nskeleton decreased by more than 50% between 2004 and 2005. The combined area of \n\nbacterial mat and black sediments declined ~ 23% between 2004 and 2005, \n\nsuggesting a gradual decline in the availability of sulfide-rich around the carcass over \n\nthis period. \n\n \n\nTable 3.4.

Broad patterns of \n\ndissimilarity at all periods were evident between areas around the whale carcass and \n\nbackground sediments (Fig. 3.9). Considering the whole period analyzed (4.5y to 6.8y), \n\nthe macrofauna exhibited significant differences between 0 m and areas further 1 m from \n\nthe carcass (ANOSIM, R= 0.445, p=0.001). At 0 m the dominant species Ophryotrocha \n\nsp. A and Ampharetid sp. 14 responded for over 40% of group similarity  (SIMPER). The \n\nmacrofaunal structure at 0.5 m at the two latter periods (5.8 and 6.8y) was also clearly \n\ndistinct from background areas (ANOSIM, p=0.002).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.9. Multidimensional scaling plot (MDS) of macrofaunal communities (>300\u00b5m) at the \nSCr whale-fall. \n \n\nThe spatial differences between communities nearby the whale-fall and \n\nbackground sediments confirm the strong heterogeneity in their dominant species, where \n\na mosaic of species from both ends colonized sediments between 1 m and 3 m. At 0 m, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n85 \n\ntemporal differences in community structure were not significant within the period \n\nanalyzed.  \n\nOur first hypothesis that whale-falls create sulfophilic and organic rich habitats \n\nwith influence on macrofaunal community structure was partially supported. After 4.5y, \n\nthe whale-fall sustained a low sediment organic enrichment, but with high sulfide \n\navailability from 5.8 to 6.8y (i.e. from 2004 to 2005). The distinct sediment geochemistry \n\nwithin 0 \u2013 0.5 m from the whale-fall continuously supported a distinct set of species after \n\n6.8 years. The data suggests that after 4.5y, the minor variability in sediment organic \n\ncarbon between 0 m and background areas could not explain the marked differences on \n\ncommunity structure. However, the effects of a significant organic input from the whale-\n\ncarcass before 4.5 y evidently favored the massive colonization of opportunist species \n\nand induced higher sedimentary microbial activity (Treude et al. 2009). The spatial \n\ndistribution of bacterial mats over sediments nearby the whale-fall supports that after 5.8 \n\ny, the gradient on sulfide availability has a fundamental role structuring the macrofaunal \n\ncommunity. \n\n \n\nFood web analysis on the macroinfauna around the Santa Cruz Whale carcass \n\n \n\nPotential food sources for the macrofauna around whale-falls include sediment \n\norganic matter (i.e. phytoplankton), metazoan biomass, whale soft tissue and sulfur-\n\noxidizing bacteria growing over reducing sediments. Whale tissue and bacterial mats \n\ngrowing over bones were sampled in the SCr whale-fall, and exhibited very distinct ?15N \n\nvalues if compared to the other organic sources (Table 3.5). The most depleted carbon \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n86 \n\nand nitrogen values come from sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, which indicates an organic \n\nmatter of local origin [Table 3.5; (Ruby et al. 1987)]. \n\n \nTable 3.5. Stable isotope signatures of potential organic sources around the SCr whale-fall. \n \n\n \n \n\n The whale-fall macrofauna exhibited wide ranges on carbon and nitrogen isotope \n\nsignatures. There was no difference on macrofaunal carbon isotope values between years \n\nsampled (average ?13C of -22.2, -19.7, and -23.6 \u2030, for 4.5, 5.8 and 6.8y, respectively). \n\nAverage macrofaunal ?15N was also similar and ranged from 4.3 to 6.1 \u2030 (from 4.5 to \n\n6.8y). Carbon isotope values ranged from -27.6 \u2030 for the dorvilleid Ophryotrocha sp.A, \n\nto -14.4 \u2030 for the Dorvilleid n.sp. (Fig. 3.10). Macrofaunal ?15N ranged from -0.6 \u2030 to \n\n12.5 \u2030 for the dorvilleid Parougia sp.A and Cumacea sp.K, respectively. The wide \n\nranges on isotope signatures for dorvilleids suggest opportunistic feeding on many \n\norganic sources, including chemoautotrophic sources of nitrogen and carbon for those \n\nspecies. The dominant macrofaunal species associated with the whale-fall from 4.5y to \n\n6.8y had isotope values consistent with primary feeding on the abundant carpets of \n\nbacteria growing around the whale carcass (Fig. 3.10). Besides sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, \n\nsediment organic carbon was a potential primary food source for Cumella sp.A and \n\ndorvilleids (Fig. 3.10). The dominant macrofaunal species did not feed directly on whale \n\nbiomass, and the major reliance on bacterial biomass (i.e. directly or trough the food \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n87 \n\nweb) suggests that the community was heavily dependent on chemosynthetic derived \n\ncarbon from 4.5 y to 6.8 y. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10.

Rare species (i.e. not \n\nincluding bkgd spp. and with &lt;1.0% rel. abundance) accounted for 38% of the total \n\nspecies richness (25 spp.). Species that were exclusively found in sediments within 0 \u2013 \n\n0.5 m of the whale-fall represented 22% (15 spp.) of the total richness, increasing to 25 \n\nspecies when 1 m samples are included. Polychaetes contributed to the majority of the \n\nspecies around (up to 0.5m) the whale carcass, with ampharetids (3 spp.), cirratulids (2 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n88 \n\nspp.), dorvilleids (7 spp.) and polynoids (1 spp.) being the most representative. The \n\nasellote isopod Ilyarachna profunda and the mytilid Idas washingtonia were also \n\nexclusively sampled within 0.5 m sediments and these species are both abundant on \n\nwhale bones (Smith &amp; Baco 2003). \n\n \nTable 3.6.

(Table 3.6). \n\nThe number of overlapping species between whale-fall and wood macrofauna was the \n\nhighest among the habitats compared, with 18% of the total species present on both \n\nhabitats (Table 3.6). A few organic respondent opportunist species present at wood and \n\nkelp falls were also present in the SCr whale fall, which contributed to higher species \n\noverlap between these organic islands. The number of species common to whale, seeps \n\nand vents was low (6 and 4%, respectively), and was mostly restricted to the dorvilleids \n\nParougia sp.A, Ophryotrocha platykephale, Schistomaringos longicornis and the \n\npolynoid Bathykurila guaymasensis (Table 3.6). Many of the dorvilleids present in the \n\nSCr whale-fall are genera that occur in seep and vent ecosystems (e.g. Parougia, \n\nOphryotrocha, Exallopus), which highlights the extreme diversity and adaptation of this \n\ngroup to reducing environments [Table 3.6, (Dahlgren et al. 2001, Thornhill et al. 2009, \n\nWiklund et al. 2009a)]. The overlap of Idas washingtonia between whale, wood, seep and \n\nvent ecosystems supports the suitability of whale and wood parcels to sustain \n\nchemoautotrophic symbiosis and the stepping stone hypothesis to dispersal of vesicomyd \n\nspecies (Smith et al. 1989, Distel et al. 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n90 \n\n3.4. Discussion \n\n \n\nAny systematic organic enrichment in surface sediments around the whale-fall \n\nhad disappeared after 4.5y, indicating that the transition between the organic-enrichment \n\n(OE) and sulfophilic (SU) stages had started (Smith &amp; Baco 2003). The absence of a \n\nbroad-scale organic enrichment at the SCr whale-fall is consistent with sedimentary \n\npatterns around other natural deep-sea whale carcasses sampled during similar \n\nsuccessional stages [i.e > 4 y; (Naganuma et al. 1996, Smith et al. 1998)]. Although the \n\nwhale carcass studied by Smith et al. (1998) was larger than the SCr whale, the former \n\nhad been in the seafloor for much longer at the time of sampling [4 \u2013 36y; (Bennett et al. \n\n1994)]. The sediments around the SCr whale-fall (0 m) exhibited a strong spatial \n\nheterogeneity in organic content at 4.5 y, with patches sustaining high organic levels (up \n\nto 11 % w/w TOC). Visual observations of samples collected in the thoracic whale-fall \n\nregion at 5.8 y also revealed the presence of pieces of whale blubber in a highly anoxic \n\nsediment (Treude et al. 2009), thus evidencing that sediment patches were still enriched \n\norganically after 5.8 y. The temporal patterns of organic enrichment from this study \n\nindicated that organically enriched sediments may persist for > 6 y around large-sized \n\n(i.e. > 10 ton) whale-falls. \n\nThe broad spatial distribution of bacterial mats around the whale skeleton for over \n\n6 years evidenced the wide availability of pore water sulfides. Bacterial mats and black \n\n(i.e. anoxic and sulphidic) sediments occupied a larger area around the thoracic and head \n\nregions, which is spatially consistent with pore-water sulfide fluxes and bacterial \n\nabundance around the SCr whale-fall (Treude et al. 2009). The temporal decrease on the \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n91 \n\ncovered area by bacterial mats and black sediments indicated a decline in the overall \n\navailability of free sulfides between 5.8 to 6.8 y (Treude et al. 2009). The bacterial mat \n\ncoverage around the SCr whale-fall is strikingly higher than other whale skeletons at \n\nsimilar successional stages. In the Santa Catalina whale-fall (SC), concentrations of \n\nsediment sulfides and abundance of sediment bacteria were low by 4 y, but bone surfaces \n\nwere still covered by bacterial mats (Bennett et al. 1994, Smith et al. 1998). Sediments \n\nsustain faster microbial degradation rates of any available organic source, as opposed to \n\nthe degradation of bone lipids from the hard bone matrix, which is mediated in the \n\nskeleton by specialized bone eating worms (Smith et al. 1998, Glover et al. 2005b, \n\nTreude et al. 2009). As a result, the lower degradation of bone lipids may extend the \n\ntemporal availability of sulfides sustaining bacterial growth on bone surfaces for periods \n\nof over 6 y (Bennett et al. 1994, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). Although sediments around whale-\n\nfalls sustain sulfate reduction and methanogenesis for over 6.8 y (Treude et al. 2009), the \n\nprocesses over bone surfaces likely lasts longer. Consequently, differences in the access \n\nto organic sources, microbial sulfate reduction rates and sulfide release are markedly \n\ndistinct between bones and sediments around whale carcasses, and have primary \n\nimportance controlling the magnitude and durability of reducing conditions. \n\nThe large area of sediments covered by bacterial carpets nearby the whale-fall is \n\nequivalent in size to visual measurements from typical chemosynthetic habitats such as \n\nseeps and vents (Sahling et al. 2002, Treude et al. 2003, Levin et al. 2009). This suggests \n\nthat whale carcasses impact similar areas of deep seafloor than cold seeps and \n\nhydrothermal vents (Bennett et al. 1994, Deming et al. 1997, Treude et al. 2009). Due to \n\nthe rapid degradation of whale organics in the sediments, the production of sulfide is \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n92 \n\nshorter in whales if compared to seeps and vents (Treude et al. 2009). However, if \n\ncompared to other organic reducing habitats (e.g. wood, kelp and other mammalian \n\ncarcasses), whale-falls may provide the best conditions to sustain chemosynthesis-based \n\nnutrition (Smith 2006, Glover et al. 2008). Whale carcasses typically are larger and \n\ncomposed of high quality organic matter, which includes about 60 % of lipids by weight \n\n(Smith 2006). In the lower range of organic enrichment are kelp and wood falls that \n\nsustain only low levels of sulfide production in nearby sediments and for very short \n\nperiods (Hannides 2008). The same occur with small-sized mammalian bones (e.g. \n\ncetaceans, cow bones), which are rapidly processed by scavengers and do not typically go \n\nthrough the EO and SU stages (Jones et al. 1998, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). Although the \n\nmammalian skeletons might have enough lipid reserves to sustain minor bacterial growth \n\nand chemosynthesis, their potential to sustain macrofaunal chemosynthesis is clearly \n\nlimited (Jones et al. 1998, Smith &amp; Baco 2003, Glover et al. 2008, Jones et al. 2008). \n\nMacrofaunal abundance was enhanced by 5-10 times around the whale-fall for \n\nover 6 y, despite any broad scale organic enrichment after 4.5 y. Macrofaunal density had \n\na pronounced small scale variability within 0.5 m, which is consistent with the patchy \n\norganic enrichment encountered. The macrofauna was dominated by organic opportunist \n\nspecies, defined by individuals that attained significant abundances at the whale carcass \n\nbut were rarely present in background sediments (Grassle &amp; Grassle 1974). The lower \n\ncommunity evenness nearby the whale-fall is a similar pattern observed at point sources \n\nof organic enrichment in shallow water sediments (Pearson &amp; Rosenberg 1978). \n\nSulfophilic species (e.g. Idas washingtonia) were additionally abundant from 4.5 to 6.8 y, \n\nwhich indicates the temporal overlap between the EO and the SU stages (Smith &amp; Baco \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n93 \n\n2003, Treude et al. 2009). The long temporal development of the EO stage within the \n\nsediments (> 4.5 yrs) could be a function of the large size of the whale carcass, and \n\nsuggests that sediment communities may experience a longer enrichment stage than \n\ntypically observed on whale-bones [about 2 y; (Smith &amp; Baco 2003)]. At the whale \n\nepifauna, the EO stage ends with a rapid removal of whale tissue attached to bones, \n\nwhich becomes unavailable to large scavengers as they fall over surrounding sediments. \n\nThe SCr whale-fall had a prolonged duration of the EO stage than other carcasses located \n\nfrom depths of 200 to 2800 m (Smith &amp; Baco 2003, Goffredi et al. 2004, Smith 2006, \n\nFujiwara et al. 2007). The difference on successional dynamics are driven by factors \n\ninfluencing the whale-fall degradation including carcass size, distinct colonizing species \n\n(e.g. scavenger communities), and depth (Smith &amp; Baco 2003). Although each whale-fall \n\nis apparently colonized by several distinct species (Fujiwara et al. 2007), the macrofaunal \n\nsuccession is driven by facilitation models and organic availability, which maintains the \n\necological function within each stage of succession (Smith &amp; Baco 2003).  \n\nBackground species were rarely seen nearby the whale-fall, possibly avoiding \n\nextreme sedimentary reducing conditions and enhanced predation (Smith et al. 1998). \n\nThe recolonization of background species (e.g. Cossura rostrata) to sediments at 1 m and \n\n0.5 m after 6.8 y, suggests that the succession was leading towards background \n\nconditions as observed at other deep-sea whale carcass in the North Pacific (Smith et al. \n\n1998). The dominant species colonizing sediments near the whale-fall were never \n\nsampled in background areas. High densities of dorvilleid polychaetes, cumaceans and \n\nampharetids lowered species diversity near the SCr whale-fall at 4.5 y, similar to \n\nobserved at hydrothermal vents and cold seep sediments (Grassle et al. 1985, Levin 2005, \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n94 \n\nLevin et al. 2009). This suggests that the flux of reduced chemicals at the whale-fall at \n\n4.5 y had a similar effect on the species structure as in other reducing habitats. Besides \n\ncontinuous sulfide availability at 5.8 and 6.8 y (Treude et al. 2009), the macrofaunal \n\ncommunity was more diverse than background sediments, which was influenced by \n\nincreased richness of organic enrichment species (i.e. dorvilleids and ampharetids). At \n\nleast 14 dorvilleid species colonized whale-fall sediments (i.e. 0 \u2013 0.5 m) between 4.5 and \n\n6.8 y, rivaling or even exceeding the high species richness for this group at cold seeps \n\n(Levin et al. 2000, Levin et al. 2003). This supports the hypothesis for resource \n\npartitioning among dorvilleids within sulfide rich habitats (Levin et al. 2003) and \n\nsuggests that whale-falls provide optimal evolutionary microhabitats for this group. This \n\nindicates that the sediment macrofauna can host an unexpected diverse community if \n\ncompared to background assemblages, as observed for the whale-fall epifauna (Baco-\n\nTaylor &amp; Smith 2003). \n\nWhale falls exhibit higher macrofaunal diversity than soft sediment habitats at \n\nhydrothermal vents and cold seeps. A comparison of active and inactive hydrothermal \n\nvent sediments in the Pacific revealed low rarefaction diversity levels at all sites, with \n\nmicrobial mat sediments sustaining the highest diversity (Levin et al. 2009). Microbial \n\nmat habitats at cold seep sites typically exhibit higher diversity than vent sediments \n\n(Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003)], and can exhibit similar diversity levels than the \n\nSCr whale-fall [(ES(100)=16 \u2013 17 at 0 m]. However, mat habitats at seep and vent \n\nsediments typically have lower diversity if compared to background areas, whereas the \n\nSCr whale-fall sustained higher species diversity than ambient sediments after 5.8 y. \n\nDiversity levels at whale fall sediments are also significantly higher than sediments \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n95 \n\naround wood and kelp-falls at similar ocean depths. The higher diversity at later stages of \n\nsuccession is explained by the colonization of sulfophilic and heterotrophic species, many \n\nof those supported by chemosynthetic organic carbon and exhibiting a wide range of \n\nfeeding modes. \n\nThe broad range of carbon sources and trophic levels found in the SCr \n\nmacrofaunal community supports the existence of complex food webs in the sediments \n\n(Smith &amp; Baco 2003). Chemosynthetic-symbiont species such as the mytilid Idas \n\nwashigtonia were abundant in sediments from 4.5 to 6.8 y, but did not reach the high \n\ndensities observed over whale bones (Baco-Taylor &amp; Smith 2003, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). \n\nSeveral trophic levels derived their nutrition direct or indirectly from sulfur-oxidizing \n\nbacterial mats, evidencing that whale-falls provide abundant sources of chemosynthetic \n\ncarbon like cold seeps and hot vents (Levin &amp; Michener 2002, Levin et al. 2009, Thurber \n\net al. 2009). The broad isotopic range in multiple congeneric dorvilleid species supports \n\nthe existence of sedimentary microhabitats with abundant sulfur-bacterial carbon. \n\nCalifornian seeps may also offer broad evolutionary habitats for dorvilleids based on \n\nwide ranges in carbon isotopic signatures and coexistence of several congeneric species \n\nfeeding on bacteria (Levin &amp; Michener 2002, Levin et al. 2003). The strong reliance on \n\nchemosynthetic carbon sources at the SCr whale-fall between 4.5 and 6.8 y is in sharp \n\ncontrast to the simple sediment food webs encountered at younger whale skeletons (&lt;1.5 \n\ny) at the Californian slope (Baco &amp; Smith in prep). At large whale carcasses, the fauna \n\nshifts from an early dependence on whale organics (i.e. bone lipids and soft tissue) \n\ntowards a late reliance on chemosynthesis (Smith &amp; Baco 2003). The reliance on \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n96 \n\nbacterial carbon between 4.5 and 6.8 y for most of the sediment macrofauna supports that \n\nduring the SU stage the food web is similar to the whale epifauna. \n\nAt higher taxonomic levels (i.e. family or genus), the macrofauna from the SCr \n\nwhale fall exhibits stronger commonalities to other organic islands, seeps and vents. \n\nDorvilleids and ampharetids polychaetes are common at a few Pacific hydrothermal \n\nsediments and at many cold seep sites in the Californian and Alaskan margins (Levin \n\n2005, Levin et al. 2009). At the species level, the SCr whale-fall exhibited limited species \n\noverlap with other chemosynthetic habitats in the deep Californian slope, confirming our \n\nsecond hypothesis. Levels of species overlap were higher between whale- and wood-falls, \n\npossibly due to closer proximity between the two (~ 100 m) and to the longer organic \n\nenrichment effects created by wood parcels if compared to kelps. Wood and kelp \n\noverlaps with the SCr whale fall were mainly represented by cumaceans (Cumella and \n\nCumacea sp.K), and the dorvilleids Ophryotrocha sp.A and Parougia sp.A. The \n\ndorvilleid Ophryotrocha platikephale and the polynoid Bathykurila guaymasensis occur \n\nat whale-falls and vents, but the latter represent potentially two genetically distinct \n\nspecies (Glover et al. 2005a). The dorvilleid genus Parougia, Ophryotrocha and \n\nSchistomaringos common to whale, seeps and vents, are mostly represented by \n\nheterotrophic dorvilleid polychaetes, but these include a broad range of morphologically \n\ndistinct species and supports the limited species overlap. The overlaps between whales, \n\nseeps and vents are typically species that are attracted to concentrations of free sulfides \n\nand that exploit sulfur-based microbial chemoautotrophic production. These conditions \n\nare typically encountered at microbial mat habitats and supports that the flux of sulfides \n\nmay be qualitatively similar between whale-falls and seeps or vents (Treude et al. 2009). \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n97 \n\nThe overlap of chemosynthetic-symbiont species was limited to Idas washingtonia, \n\nwhich is part of a mytilid group abundant at both seeps, vents and wood-falls (Samadi et \n\nal. 2007, Lorion et al. 2009). Other unidentified vesicomyd bivalves colonized whale-fall \n\nsediments, but the macrofauna had a limited number of chemoautotrophic species if \n\ncompared to the epifaunal communities (Smith &amp; Baco 2003). These could be a function \n\nof limited sampling on the whale-fall macrofauna, due to the unfavorable and patchy \n\nbiogeochemical gradients within the sediments and even intense predation limiting the \n\ndevelopment of adult symbiont-containing species.  \n\n The SCr whale-fall sediment macrofauna appeared to host a few endemic species \n\nthat attained high abundances but were never sampled at background sediments or any \n\nother organic islands sunk nearby. At least three unidentified ampharetids, and two \n\ndorvilleid species (Ophryotrocha sp.E and Exallopus sp.A) were extremely abundant \n\nnearby the whale carcass and may represent specialists. Dorvilleids of the genus \n\nOphryotrocha are commonly associated with organically enriched or polluted sediments \n\nand exhibit surprisingly high species richness (Dahlgren et al. 2001, Wiklund et al. \n\n2009a). It is clear that further taxonomic and phylogenetic efforts on the whale-fall \n\ndorvilleids [> 40 spp., (Smith &amp; Baco 2003)], will increase the number of whale-fall \n\nendemics. Where sufficient data is available, several whale-fall specialists have been \n\ndescribed, with at least 20 species being exclusively found on whale skeletons and many \n\nother new species await identification (Baco &amp; Smith 2003, Smith &amp; Baco 2003, \n\nDahlgren et al. 2004, Glover et al. 2005b, Pleijel et al. 2008). The number of whale fall \n\nendemics inhabiting sediments will certainly grow with the use of molecular tools to \n\ndifferentiate cryptic species associated with whales (Vrijenhoek 2009, Wiklund et al. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n98 \n\n2009b). Whale carcasses are one of the least studied chemosynthetic habitats in the deep-\n\nsea (Smith &amp; Baco 2003), and the sediment macrofauna has been vastly understudied in \n\nworldwide efforts to document whale-fall diversity. \n\nThe long persistence of whale falls over the deep-sea (> 20 \u2013 30 yrs) allied to the \n\ncomplex suite of niches over whale bones and in sediments, create oasis of opportunity \n\nfor species able to colonize it and disperse (Smith et al. 1989, Distel et al. 2000, Baco &amp; \n\nSmith 2003, Schuller et al. 2004). Whale carcasses are undoubtedly among the most \n\nspecies rich hard-substrata habitat in the deep-sea (Baco &amp; Smith 2003), and this study \n\nevidenced that the sediment macrofauna is more diverse than other similar reducing \n\nhabitats and background sediments. Whale-falls are colonized by a broad range of \n\nabundant sulfophilic and organic respondent species that are not seen over vast areas of \n\ndeep-sea sediments. As observed at seep and vent habitats, many species colonizing \n\nmodern whale falls have irradiated from other reducing habitats (e.g. seeps, vents, wood-\n\nfalls, fish farms), supporting the stepping stone theory (Smith et al. 1989, Baco-Taylor et \n\nal. 1999, Distel et al. 2000, Van Dover et al. 2002, Lorion et al. 2009, Wiklund et al. \n\n2009b). The fact that the whale-fall macrofauna sustain higher diversity levels than \n\nsimilar sulfide rich communities in the deep-sea, suggests that carcasses concentrate a \n\nvast and unknown number of species that exploit reducing habitats in the deep-sea. \n\nThe evolutionary story of whale-falls dates back at least 11-30 Myr, and together \n\nwith seeps and wood-falls provided habitats for a broad range of taxonomic and \n\nfunctional groups in deep-sea (Baco et al. 1999, Kiel &amp; Goedert 2006, Smith 2006). \n\nSeveral species only found at whale carcasses are directly dependent on bones [e.g. \n\nOsedax worms, (Rouse et al. 2004)], and many others that attain extremely high densities \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n99 \n\nat carcasses are also likely specialists on this habitat (Smith &amp; Baco 2003, Smith 2006). \n\nThis suggests that during the evolutionary lifetime, whale-falls harbored a variety of taxa \n\nand trophic types that may be adapted to the resources provided by its habitats (Smith \n\n2006). Consequently, as whale-fall communities harbor one of the most species rich \n\ndeep-sea reducing habitats, whale exploitation by humans may pose great impact on \n\nglobal deep-sea diversity (Smith 2006). \n\n \n \n3.5. Conclusions \n \n  \n\nIn contrast to the sediment macrofauna studied around other deep-sea whale-\n\nskeletons, the SCr macrofauna appeared to host a remarkable species diversity composed \n\nof many rare species not seen on background assemblages. The whale-fall supported \n\nlarge opportunist and chemoautotrophic communities for over 6.8 y, with only modest \n\norganic enrichment but with marked chemical impacts on the surrounding sediments. \n\nAfter 4.5 y, the SCr whale-fall macrofauna appeared to match the transition between the \n\norganic-enrichment and the sulfophilic stages described by Smith and Baco (2003), \n\npossibly indicating a longer successional periods at the sediments. The whale-fall \n\nmacrofauna had high numbers of species not present in background sediments, and \n\nsignificantly increase local species diversity for at least 7 yrs. The sediments around the \n\nSCr whale-fall exhibited higher diversity levels than other similar habitats at cold seeps \n\nand hydrothermal vents, with low level of species overlap, confirming that whale-falls are \n\nunique oasis of deep-sea biodiversity across wide ocean basis. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n100 \n\n3.6.

The San Clemente cold seep: macrofaunal structure \n\nand species overlap with reducing habitats in the deep NE \n\nPacific \n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe San Clemente cold seep lies within 100-200 km of other reducing \n\nenvironments in the NE Pacific, offering an interesting opportunity to examine \n\ndiversity and species overlap among reducing habitats (i.e., whale-falls, kelp, and \n\nwood parcels) at similar ocean depths. Using Alvin, we observed clumps of \n\ntubeworms Lamellibrachia barhami and Escarpia spicata distributed as meter-scale \n\npatches among vesicomyd clam beds and black sediments. We used core samples and \n\nstable isotopic analyses to evaluate infaunal macrobenthic community structure and \n\nnutrition sources of dominant organisms at distances of 0, 1, 10 and 100 m from \n\ntubeworm thickets. Macro-infaunal abundance was elevated at 0 to 1 meters \n\ncompared to seep sites 100 m away. Mats of Siboglinum sp. were conspicuous in \n\nsediments within 1 m of tubeworm thickets (2906 \u00b1 606 ind m-2 at 0 m). Other \n\npolychaete worms dominated macrofaunal abundances at all distances sampled (over \n\n60% of individuals), with tanaids (11%) and isopod crustaceans also being abundant. \n\nSpecies richness and diversity were slightly depressed at seep sites, increasing \n\noutwards from worm clumps. The San Clemente seep sediment macrofaunal \n\ncommunity contains intermediate levels of species richness and diversity compared to \n\nother seep areas. Stable isotope data showed high variability in ?C13 values for \n\ndistinct faunal groups (polychaetes and crustaceans), as has been observed at other \n\nseeps. Overall, &lt;20% species overlap was found between the San Clemente seep and \n\nwood-, whale- and kelp-fall communities at similar ocean depths within the region. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n112\u00a0\n\n4.1. Introduction \n\n \n\n Cold seeps occur in geologically active and passive continental margins at \n\ndepths from 15m to over 7000 m, where the seepage of reduced chemical substances \n\nfuel chemosynthesis-based benthic communities (Sibuet &amp; Olu 1998, Levin 2005). \n\nSubmarine fluid venting of methane and other hydrocarbon gasses support high \n\nsurface and sub-surface concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, which is produced by \n\nmicrobial anaerobic methane oxidation coupled to sulfate reduction (Boetius et al. \n\n2000, Treude et al. 2003). The upward flow of sulfide and/or methane provides \n\nenergy for chemosynthetically based microorganisms, either free-living or in \n\nsymbiotic association with metazoans (Barry et al. 1997, Sibuet &amp; Olu 1998, Levin \n\n2005). Most symbiont-bearing invertebrates are megafaunal groups with broad \n\nbiogeographic distributions and include vesicomyd clams, mytilid and solemyid \n\nbivalves, vestimentiferan and pogonophoran polychaetes (Sibuet &amp; Olu 1998, Kojima \n\n2002, Van Dover et al. 2002, Levin 2005). These organisms commonly make up the \n\nhighest megafaunal biomass at seeps and are fundamentally dependent on the flux of \n\nreducing compounds for their nutrition (Barry et al. 1997). Giving that sulfide and \n\nmethane fluxes can be remarkably heterogeneous in space and time, distinct patterns \n\nof faunal distribution occur between habitats at each geological feature (Barry et al. \n\n1997, Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003, Treude et al. 2003, Van Dover et al. \n\n2003, Levin 2005).  \n\nSeveral investigations have looked and compared infaunal community \n\nstructure at cold seeps from shelf to abyssal depths (Sibuet &amp; Olu 1998, Levin et al. \n\n2000, Kojima 2002, Sahling et al. 2002, Van Dover et al. 2003, Levin 2005, Levin &amp; \n\nMendoza 2007). These studies revealed high habitat variability on macrofaunal \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n113\u00a0\n\ndensity, composition and diversity, with strong differences between seep and non-\n\nseep sediments at deeper sites (Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003). Sediment \n\ngeochemistry can vary significantly between seep microhabitats, creating very \n\nspecific conditions for its associated community (Tryon &amp; Brown 2001). For \n\nexample, sulfide-rich sediments host many chemosynthetic-based and endemic \n\nspecies, such as Beggiatoa mats, bivalves, pogonophoran and other polychaetes \n\n(Barry et al. 1997, Sibuet &amp; Olu 1998, Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003, Thurber \n\net al. 2009). Several heterotrophic opportunist species are also able to tolerate such \n\nhigh sulphidic sediments and exploit rich organic sources in some seep habitats \n\n(Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003). Consequently, there is a broad spectrum on \n\nthe utilization of chemosynthetic- or photosynthetic-derived organic carbon in the \n\nheterotrophic macrofauna, which is linked to habitat heterogeneity and availability of \n\nmany organic sources within seeps (Levin &amp; Michener 2002). Such availability is \n\nrelated to bathymetric variations on chemosynthetic versus ambient organic \n\navailability (Levin et al. 2000, Levin &amp; Michener 2002). \n\nThe San Clemente cold seep was discovered in 1979 and first described as a \n\nvent ecosystem (Lonsdale 1979). It has been poorly sampled with only 3 megafaunal \n\norganisms formally described: the vestimentiferan Lamellibrachia barhami, a general \n\nspecies of vesicomyid and a bryozoan (Sibuet &amp; Olu 1998). The macroinfauna from \n\nSan Clemente has not been studied in detail and its position and depth (1800 m) offer \n\nan interesting opportunity to investigate species overlap among other reducing \n\nhabitats at the Southern Californian slope. The San Clemente seep lies downstream of \n\nthree implanted whales, kelp and wood-falls at similar depths in the California basin, \n\nwhich could serve as a recruitment source for invertebrates exploiting sulfide-rich \n\nconditions (Smith &amp; Baco 2003). Some of the enrichment opportunist and sulfide-\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n114\u00a0\n\ntolerant species are common to reducing deep-sea habitats such as vents, whale- and \n\nwood-falls (Levin et al. 2006, Smith et al. in prep). Whale-falls in particular have \n\nbeen proposed as dispersal stepping-stones for organisms (e.g. vesicomyids) thriving \n\nat deep reducing habitats, but so far only a limited overlap of species has been \n\ndemonstrated (Smith et al. 1989, Sibuet &amp; Olu 1998, Tunnicliffe et al. 1998, Baco-\n\nTaylor et al. 1999, Smith &amp; Baco 2003). Difficulty in sampling has made quantitative \n\nstudies of species richness in these communities rare and comparisons of species \n\noverlap between these sites at single basins are practically absent. \n\n The primary objective of this study was to examine the structure and \n\ncomposition of the macroinfauna at the San Clement seep and investigate levels of \n\nspecies overlap with a whale-fall and other organic islands situated at about 100 km \n\nnorthwest of the seep site (Fig. 1.1). We also investigated nutrition sources of \n\nabundant macroinfauna at seep habitats through stable isotope analysis and compared \n\nspecies diversity at several distances from \u201cseep areas\u201d to ambient communities, and \n\nto other comparable seep environments. We ask the following questions: (1) What is \n\nthe level of macrofaunal species overlap between San Clemente seep and other \n\nassemblages from reducing habitats at similar depths? (2) What is the level of \n\nmacroinfaunal endemism at the San Clemente seep and how species composition \n\nchange relative to ambient sediments? We hypothesized that the macroinfauna will \n\nexhibit low levels of overlap among other organic habitats at the California margin \n\nand that species composition at seep sediments will be markedly distinct from \n\nambient assemblages. \n\n \n\n4.2. Study site and methods \n\n  \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n115\u00a0\n\nThe San Clemente seep is located at 1800 m depth on a transform fault off the \n\ncoast of southern California at 32? 12? N; 117? 44? W (Chapter 1 - Fig. 1.1). Large \n\nbarium sulfate deposits occur as large blocks on the seafloor (Torres et al. 2002), \n\noften anchoring thickets of tubeworms Lamellibrachia barhami and Escarpia spicata \n\n(Fig. 4.1 A-B). Vesicomyid clams (Calyptogena pacifica) are also common \n\nmegafaunal organisms often seen nearby worm thickets (Fig. 4.1). Worm thickets \n\nwere often surrounded by clam patches, usually located within darkened sediments \n\nwith presumably high sulfide levels (Fig. 4.1 C-D). Reported methane analyses at the \n\nsite indicate very heterogeneous pore-water concentrations within the top 10 cm \n\nsediments, which are higher adjacent to tubeworm thickets [0m, 12-46 \u00b5l/ml; (Torres \n\net al. 2000)].  \n\nSediment macrofauna was sampled in October 1999 on board of the R/V \n\nAtlantis using the manned submersible Alvin (Table 4.1). Replicate sediment samples \n\nwere collected immediately adjacent to tubeworm thickets (0 m), and at 1 m, 10 m \n\nand over 100 meters away, which represented background samples (Table 4.1). \n\nCorers were sliced at three vertical sections (0-1, 1-5 and 5-10cm) and sediments \n\nwere immediately preserved in 10% v/v buffered formalin-seawater solution onboard \n\nthe ship. Once in the laboratory, samples were washed on 300 um sieves and \n\ntransferred to 80% ethanol.  Macrofauna (>300 um) were sorted using dissecting \n\nmicroscopes and individuals were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible \n\nusing the available keys and with help from taxonomists. Reference individuals from \n\nthis seep were compared directly to the southern California basin whale falls \n\nreference collection in order to evaluate the species overlap between macroinfaunal \n\ncommunities. Digital stills and video taken throughout the Alvin dives helped to \n\nvisually distinguish seep habitats (Fig. 4.1). \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n116\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.

Ekman core, 10cm I.D. \n \n\n \n\nSediment sampling consisted of typically 5 to 8 replicate cores per distance \n\nsampled. Macrofaunal density was quantified as individuals per square meter (ind. m-\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n117\u00a0\n\n2) due to differences in sampled areas between Alvin tube and Ekman corers (38.5 and \n\n78.5 cm2, respectively). Community composition was assessed by sample \n\nindependent analyses in order to reduce effects of sampling area on diversity \n\nestimates. Hulbert\u2019s rarefaction curve [ES(n);(Hulbert 1971)] was used to compare \n\nspecies diversity between treatments. Background replicate cores (n=5) were \n\ncombined to calculate a composite diversity for the ambient community, and \n\nconfidence limits were calculated from one-tailed 95% confidence interval [see \n\nChapters 2 and 3; (Smith 1986)]. Pielou\u2019s evenness (J\u2019) was used to provide \n\ninformation on species structure using the statistical package PRIMER-E ? (Clarke &amp; \n\nWarwick 2001). Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) was applied to macrofaunal \n\nabundance (? transformed) in order to emphasize similarity in species composition \n\namong habitats (Clarke &amp; Warwick 2001). Multivariate analysis of similarities \n\n(ANOSIM) helped to differentiate samples and SIMPER analysis identified groups or \n\nspecies responsible for those patterns (Clarke &amp; Warwick 2001). Statistical indexes \n\nwere calculated with parametric or non-parametric methods whenever applicable, \n\nusing the statistical software BioEstat?. \n\nDominant macrofaunal organisms from sediment samples at 0 and 1 m were \n\nselected for stable isotope analysis. All selected specimens were thoroughly rinsed in \n\nDI water and cleaned of attached debris prior to analysis. Polychaetes were removed \n\nfrom tubes and muscle tissues of bivalves (i.e. avoiding gills) were dissected using \n\nmethanol-cleaned equipment. Samples were decalcified with phosphoric acid and \n\nplaced in pre-weighed tin cups for overnight drying (35-40 \u00baC). Multiple individuals \n\nof the same species (N= 3 to 13) were combined in one sample to make up 0.5-2 mg \n\nof dry weight, necessary for analysis. Whenever possible, replicate measurements of \n\ngrouped individuals were carried and stable isotope data represent average values \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n118\u00a0\n\nwithin single species. We recognize the potential for nutritional variability within \n\nseep individuals (Thurber et al. 2009), but we believe that the data is still informative \n\nof food web patterns at our study site. Unfortunately, we lack isotope data from a \n\nbroad number of background species and from potential organic sources from San \n\nClemente, and therefore we do not present mixing-model calculations of organic \n\nsources for the organisms analyzed. Statistical comparisons of isotope values across \n\nspecies were not possible due to limited number of replicates available, therefore \n\ndifferences are conservatively assumed based on standard error from measurements. \n\nIsotope samples were combusted in a Eurovector (Milan, Italy) elemental \n\nanalyzer interfaced with an Isoprime isotope ratio mass spectrometer for \n\ndetermination of 15N/14N and 13C/12C ratios (reproducibility: \u00b10.5 \u2030 for ?15N and \n\n\u00b10.2 \u2030 for ? 13C). Macrofaunal C-isotopic ratios were measured against a Pee Dee \n\nBelemnite (PDB) standard for ?13C and atmospheric nitrogen for ?15N. Results are \n\nexpressed in units per mil (\u2030) as delta notation (?) representing the relative \n\ndifference between sample and standard, where ?X (\u2030) = [(Rsample/Rstandard)-1] x \n\n103, where R=15N/14N or R=14C/13C. In this study, we corrected for preservation \n\nartifacts by adding 1\u2030 to ? 13C (Fry &amp; Sherr 1989, Edwards et al. 2002, Sarakinos et \n\nal. 2002). Trophic changes of +3\u2030 were added to the range of ?15N values obtained \n\nfor each organic matter source. Species that exclusively use a particular organic-\n\nmatter source for nutrition are expected to fall within the appropriate trophic-shift \n\nbox. \n\n4.3. Results \n\nImage observations \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n119\u00a0\n\nVideo images from Alvin dives permitted the identification of distinct macro-\n\nhabitats, such as tubeworm thickets, vesicomyid clam beds, black sediments and non-\n\nreduced sediments (Fig. 4.1). From Alvin images we could not visually identify the \n\nspatial distribution of siboglinid polychaetes, as these were typically small (&lt;3-5 cm) \n\nand not detected by video. Tubeworm thickets (i.e. vestimentiferans) were either \n\nanchored on barium sulfate rocks or aggregated within patches of blackened \n\nsediments widely distributed over the seep. Clam aggregations were commonly \n\nobserved within dark sediment patches that were not colonized by tubeworms, and \n\nclamshell fragments were often seen around tubeworm patches (Fig. 4.1). Black \n\nsediments were heterogeneously distributed around tubeworm thickets, being \n\ninterrupted by areas of light colored sediments without clams (Fig. 4.1). Sediments \n\ncoring randomly started immediately under tubeworm thickets towards background \n\nsediments 100 meters away. \n\n \n\nMacrofauna density and composition \n\n Total macrofaunal densities were significantly higher at 0 and 1-meter \n\nsediments if compared to the background (Kruskal Wallis test, H=9.68, p=0.02). \n\nAverage densities at 0 m were over two times higher than background sediments \n\n(2378 \u00b1 257 ind. m-2; Fig. 4.2). At 0 and 1m, siboglinid polychaetes were extremely \n\nabundant (2906 \u00b1 606 ind. m-2 and 1652 \u00b1 257 ind. m-2, respectively), and \n\nheterogeneously distributed within patches but their abundance was not different \n\nbetween 0 and 1 meters (ANOVA). Sediment patches colonized by siboglinid worms \n\nwere present 10 meters away from tubeworm thickets with dense mats in some areas. \n\nThe vertical macrofaunal distribution within the sediments did not reveal any \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n120\u00a0\n\nsignificant patterns between distances sampled, suggesting weak gradients of pore-\n\nwater sulfides in the area (Kruskal Wallis test). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2. Total macrofaunal density at seep and background sites (Average \u00b1 1 SE). \n\n \n\nPolychaete worms typically dominated the macrofauna at all distances \n\nsampled with over 65% of all individuals. Polychaete dominance changed markedly \n\nacross the seep areas sampled. At 0 and 1 m, Siboglinum sp. 1 represented over 25% \n\nof the fauna (Fig. 4.3), and was among the top-ranked species up to 10 meters (Table \n\n4.2). A tanaid species, one syllid polychaete and one thyasirid bivalve were among \n\nthe top ranked species at 0 meters, and together with Siboglinum sp. 1 comprised over \n\n58% of all individuals. The dorvilleids Meiodorvillea and Pinniphitime were found at \n\nSan Clemente seep but never reached high abundances, always comprising 1-5% of \n\nthe macrofauna from 0 to 10 meters (Appendix 4A). At 10 meters, spionid (15%), \n\ncirratulid (12%) and other polychaete worms (25%) were dominant, a pattern similar \n\nto background sediments (Fig. 4.3). Tanaids were abundant at 0 to 1m sediments (8-\n\n13% of rel. abundance) and thyasirid bivalves were common at all seep and non-seep \n\nareas sampled, comprising 4-7% of the infauna at all sites (Fig. 4.3; Appendix 4A). \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n121\u00a0\n\n \nFigure 4.3 Macrofaunal composition at San Clemente cold seep. \n \n\n \nTable 4.2.

Low diversity levels at 0 m sediments were \n\nassociated with significant lower community evenness at 0 m (ANOVA, F=4.985, \n\nd.f.=3, p=0.011; Table 4.3) if compared to all other distances sampled. At 1 - 10 \n\nmeters, community evenness exhibited background values, but diversity was higher \n\ndue to the presence of seep (e.g. Siboglinum sp. 1) and ambient species. Rarefaction \n\ndiversity did not reveal significant differences between seep and non-seep areas, \n\nalthough 0 m curves fell below background (Table 4.3; Fig. 4.4). Expected species \n\ndiversity suggests that the number of species at 0 meters was still increasing rapidly \n\nwith the increase in the number of individuals (Fig. 4.4). Although E (S50) was lower \n\nat 0 m if compared to 1 m, the former curve is steeper than all other sampled areas \n\nand suggests higher species richness at 0 m (Fig. 4.4). \n\nTable 4.3.

Rarefaction species diversity at San Clemente cold seep. \n\nMultidimensional analysis revealed a strong spatial heterogeneity in \n\nmacrofaunal composition at the San Clemente seep sediments (Fig. 4.5). In general, \n\nseep habitats were very heterogeneous with no significant difference in species \n\ncomposition (ANOSIM test, r= 0.303), although samples from 0 m and 1 m grouped \n\ndistinctly from the others (Fig. 4.5). Similarities within seep sites were low (25 - 30%, \n\nat 0 m and 1 m), and increased towards background areas (54%, SIMPER). Higher \n\ndissimilarity at seep areas closer to tubeworm thickets corroborates the strong spatial \n\nsediment heterogeneity observed. The top-ranked species responded for most of the \n\nobserved dissimilarity. Siboglinum sp. 1 was a key species determining high \n\ndissimilarities between 0 and 1 m sediments, and spionids, cossurids and tanaidaceans \n\nwere most significant at 10 m and background sediments (SIMPER). \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n124\u00a0\n\n \n\nFigure 4.5. Multidimensional scaling plot of San Clemente seep macroinfauna (> 300\u00b5).  \n \n\nA total of 74 species were identified at the San Clemente seep macrofauna. \n\nSpecies richness was highly heterogeneous between seep areas, with 34 of 58 species \n\nexclusively sampled from 0 to 1 meters. There were a few seep species abundant at 0 \n\nand 1m that were not seen or were rare at non-seep areas (i.e. less than 5% rel. \n\nabundance). These include two top ranked species at seep sites: Siboglinum sp. 1, and \n\nSphaerosyllis sp. A. At \u201cnon-seep\u201d areas, only the top-ranked Tanaid sp. E was \n\nabundant at background sediments and not at 0 m sediments. \n\nThe number of species overlapping with other reducing habitats at the \n\nCalifornian slope was limited. About 12 % of the macrofaunal species abundant at 0 \n\nand 1 m (i.e. \u201cseep\u201d species), were encountered at sediments around wood parcels \n\n(Bernardino et al. in prep), and 9% were shared with whale-fall sediments (Smith et \n\nal., in prep). The overlapped species are typical heterotrophic organisms (i.e. grazers \n\nand predators), with only thyasirid bivalves potentially deriving their nutrition from \n\nchemosynthesis (Dando &amp; Spiro 1993). Shared species between seep and wood (n= 4 \n\nspp.) included the ampharetid polychaete Amelina abyssalis, Thyasirid sp. 2, an \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n125\u00a0\n\nasellote isopod and Aricidea cf. lopezi. Overlapped species between whale and seep \n\n(n= 3 spp.) included Ampharetid sp. 1 and two paranoid species of the Aricidea \n\ncomplex. No species from the seep were observed around kelp parcels, and none of \n\nthe top-ranked species from San Clemente colonized any organic island. \n\n \n\nStable isotope analysis \n\n \n\nStable isotope analyses were carried on six abundant macrofaunal species \n\nfrom 0 and 1 m (Fig. 4.6). The number of individuals analyzed for each species \n\nranged from N=3 to 13, and carbon and nitrogen isotope values revealed wide \n\nnutritional dependence on food sources (Fig. 4.6). Macrofaunal carbon isotope \n\nsignatures ranged from -57.4\u2030 to -23\u2030 and nitrogen values from -7.4\u2030 to 11.6\u2030, \n\nsuggesting both chemosynthetic and heterotrophic nutrition. The average carbon and \n\nnitrogen isotope values of the top-ranked species at 0 m and 1 m (-39.7\u2030 and -0.6\u2030, \n\nrespectively), suggests utilization of chemosynthetically fixed organic matter (Fisher \n\n1999, Levin &amp; Michener 2002). Very negative ?13C signatures were evident on two \n\nspecies that host chemosynthetic symbionts. Individuals of Siboglinum sp. 1, had the \n\nmost depleted carbon isotope signature (-51.1 \u00b1 8.3 \u2030), indicating incorporation of \n\nmethane-derived carbon (Dando et al. 2008). However, the broad carbon and nitrogen \n\nisotope range for this species (?13C = -44.7\u2030 to -60.4\u2030 and ?15N= -6.5\u2030 to -7.4\u2030) \n\nindicates broad individual variability on carbon uptake and suggests either \n\nmethanotrophic or sulfide-oxidizing symbionts (Fig. 4.6). Specimens of Thyasirid sp. \n\n4 had carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures that suggested incorporation of \n\nchemosynthetic carbon from sulfide-oxidizing symbionts (Dando &amp; Spiro 1993). Four \n\nspecies exhibited nitrogen isotope values that suggest heterotrophic nutrition (Fig. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n126\u00a0\n\n4.6). Those were the polychaete Sphaerosyllis and the crustacean Tanaid sp. 1, which \n\nhad carbon isotopic signatures indicative of nutrition on chemosynthetic-derived \n\norganic matter. The other two heterotrophs were the paranoid polychaete Levinsenia \n\noculata and the dorvilleid Meiodorvillea, which likely fed both on photosynthetic \n\norganic mater and sulfur bacteria (Fig. 4.6). \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6.

Bacteria: range in SI values from chemosynthetic \nbacteria, Ruby et al., 1987. \n \n\n \n4.4. Discussion \n\nThe seep of San Clemente is a methane seep characterized by extensive \n\ndeposits of barium sulfate, which are often observed as large blocks on the seafloor \n\nand can serve as anchors for large tubeworm thickets (Torres et al. 2002). Tubeworm \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n127\u00a0\n\nthickets and vesicomyid clams were commonly observed within dark colored \n\nsediments, which were heterogeneously distributed at the seepage area. Sediments \n\ncovered by bacterial mats were not visually detected at San Clemente suggesting that \n\ncontrary to several seeps in the Californian slope, this habitat is not prominent at our \n\nstudy site. The presence of vesicomyid calms and vestimentiferan tubeworms at San \n\nClemente is compatible with megafaunal biogeographic patterns along seeps in the \n\nEast and West Pacific continental margins (Barry et al. 1996, Sibuet &amp; Olu 1998). \n\nAnother prominent group of organisms present at the San Clemente seep were \n\npogonophoran polychaetes (Frenulata: Siboglinidae), which formed conspicuous mats \n\nheterogeneity distributed in sediments within 10 meters from tubeworm thickets. \n\nSiboglinids (a.k.a pogonophorans) often colonize sediments with lower sulfide or \n\nmethane levels, contrary to their related vestimentiferans (Southward et al. 2005). At \n\nseep areas where siboglinids fields are prominent, they reach high abundances in \n\nreducing sediments with dissolved methane or sulfide, allowing them to nurture their \n\nbacterial symbionts and yet provide access to oxygenated waters through their \n\nanterior end (Schulze &amp; Halanych 2003, Southward et al. 2005, Dando et al. 2008, \n\nSommer et al. 2009). At the San Clemente seep, their higher abundance at sediments \n\nnearby tubeworm thickets suggests a heterogeneous spatial distribution on the flux of \n\nreduced chemicals, apparently centered at the tubeworm tickets.  \n\nThe polychaete Siboglinum was extremely abundant in some areas within the \n\nseep and their characteristic chitinous tubes potentially modified the sedimentary \n\nstructure and influenced the macrofaunal composition within their habitat (Bergquist \n\net al. 2003, Dando et al. 2008). We could not taxonomically distinguish more than \n\none Siboglinum species at San Clemente, but siboglinids are commonly found in \n\nmultiple species associations and is an extremely diverse group (Southward et al. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n128\u00a0\n\n2005, Hil\u00e1rio &amp; Cunha 2008). Considering their fundamental role as macrofaunal \n\norganisms at sediments within 0 to 1 meter of tubeworm thickets, these areas will be \n\nfurther denominated as the \u201csiboglinid habitat\u201d. \n\nDensity differences between the siboglinid habitat and background sediments \n\nwere significant in the San Clemente seep and is consistent with increased local \n\nenergy input within a food poor deep-sea background (Levin 2005). The higher \n\nenergetic availability influenced the macrofaunal abundance up to 10 meters from \n\ntubeworm clumps, although the number of organisms gradually decreased along the \n\nsampled transects. The observed differences on macrofaunal abundance also suggests \n\nstronger reliance on chemosynthetic food sources (Levin &amp; Michener 2002), and is \n\nconsistent with the dominance of chemosynthetic organisms within the siboglinid \n\nhabitat. The siboglinid habitat exhibited macrofaunal densities (6821 ind.m-2) \n\ncomparable to pogonophoran fields at deeper seeps in the Gulf of Alaska (~ 4000m; \n\n6625 to 9739 ind. m-2), but lower densities than similar habitats at shelf to slope \n\ndepths in the North Sea and Gulf of Cadiz (Dando et al. 1994, Levin 2005, Levin &amp; \n\nMendoza 2007, Sommer et al. 2009). Depth-related effects of food limitation on \n\nmacrofaunal abundance are masked at seep sites where the input of chemosynthetic \n\ncarbon can provide the fauna with additional energy sources (Levin 2005). At our \n\nstudy site we observed the local effects of an increased supply of chemosynthetic \n\ncarbon to the fauna. The higher macrofaunal densities at abyssal seeps in the Gulf of \n\nAlaska if compared to San Clemente are probably related to increased organic input \n\n(chemosynthetic and photosynthetic) in Alaska, producing the differences on faunal \n\nabundance between these areas (Smith &amp; Demopoulos 2003, Rathburn et al. 2009).  \n\nSupporting our hypothesis, the macroinfauna composition at San Clemente \n\nwas markedly distinct between the siboglinid habitat and background sediments. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n129\u00a0\n\nMultidimensional analysis evidenced the strong spatial heterogeneity in the San \n\nClemente seep sediments, but with a visible separation on macrofauna composition \n\nbetween the siboglinid habitat and background sediments. Species composition within \n\nthe siboglinid habitat was dominated by Siboglinum sp. 1. Siboglinids are abundant at \n\nseeps in Pacific and in the Atlantic, notably at the Gulf of Alaska, New Zealand, at \n\nmud volcanos and organically enriched sediments in the deep NE Atlantic (Levin &amp; \n\nMendoza 2007, Dando et al. 2008, Hil\u00e1rio &amp; Cunha 2008, Baco et al. 2009). Syllid \n\npolychaetes, peracarid crustaceans and thyasirid bivalves were also very abundant at \n\nthe siboglinid habitat in San Clemente. Thyasirid bivalves have wide trophic \n\nstrategies, from heterotrophy to chemosynthesis through sulfur-oxidizing symbionts \n\n(Dando &amp; Spiro 1993, Dando et al. 2008). Tanaids are also a conspicuous group at \n\npogonophoran fields in the Gulf of Alaska and at clam bed habitats and background \n\nsediments on the Californian margin (Levin et al. 2003, Levin &amp; Mendoza 2007). At \n\nSan Clemente, at least four thyasirid species and two tanaids were successfully \n\nexploiting both siboglinid and background habitats, with different species prevailing \n\nbetween those habitats. \n\nDorvilleid polychaetes were poorly represented at San Clemente but are often \n\na dominant group at methane seeps (Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003). \n\nDorvilleids are especially abundant in bacterial mat habitats where high sulphidic \n\nsediments might favor their recruitment and increase food availability through \n\nbacterial biomass (Levin et al. 2003, Levin 2005, Levin et al. 2006). The absence of \n\nbacterial mat habitats at our study site explains the lower abundance of dorvilleids and \n\nindicates lower sulfide availability over the sediment surface at the time of sampling. \n\nSiboglinids are known to tolerate very low sulfide levels and are able to utilize \n\nenormous quantities of sulfide or methane before concentrations peak at surface \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n130\u00a0\n\nsediments (Schulze &amp; Halanych 2003, Dando et al. 2008, Sommer et al. 2009). The \n\nhigh densities attained by Siboglinum at 0 to 1 meter sediments could well result in \n\nefficient sulfide utilization in San Clemente sediments, and inhibit the growth of \n\nbacterial carpets and its associated fauna. We need a better geochemical data to fully \n\naddress the sulfide and methane levels within San Clemente sediments and to test if \n\nthere is any biological control in the development of optimal habitats for dorvilleids. \n\nStable isotope analysis indicated a strong reliance on chemosynthetic nutrition \n\nfor the dominant species associated with the siboglinid habitat. The siboglinid worms \n\nderive their nutrition from sulphur-oxidizing symbiotic bacteria living within their \n\ntrophosome, with only one species (Siboglinum poseidoni) so far known to host \n\nmethanotrophic symbionts (Southward et al. 2005). At the San Clemente seep, broad \n\nisotopic signatures within Siboglinum specimens indicate incorporation of \n\nchemosynthetic carbon through either methane- or sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and \n\nsuggest association of multiple congeneric species. Similar variability on mean ?13C \n\nsignatures (-36.1\u2030 to -66.6\u2030) were encountered in siboglinids from New Zealand \n\nseeps, where multiple species with varied trophic associations coexist (Thurber et al. \n\n2009). However, although Siboglinum from San Clemente suggests incorporation of \n\nmethane carbon, further molecular analysis are required to confirm methanotrophy or \n\nto address if multiple species coexist at this seep site (Dando et al. 2008). Thyasirid \n\nsp. 4 was another species that relied on sulphur chemosynthetic nutrition from \n\nsymbionts, confirming their typical thiotrophic associations (Dando &amp; Spiro 1993). \n\nThe average ?13C values of the siboglinid habitat macrofauna at San Clemente (-\n\n36.1\u2030) is heavier than observed at similar habitats in the Gulf of Alaska (-46.4\u2030) \n\nwhere the percentage of methane derived carbon utilized by the fauna averages 44% \n\n(Levin &amp; Michener 2002). The ?13C values at the siboglinid habitat in San Clemente \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n131\u00a0\n\nindicates strong reliance of chemosynthetic carbon at San Clemente but with \n\nincreased utilization of other food sources if compared to the deeper Alaskan seeps \n\n(Levin &amp; Michener 2002). However, direct comparisons on the contribution of \n\nmethane-derived carbon and other food sources between our study and other seeps are \n\nnot possible until source-mixing calculations are carried at the San Clemente \n\nmacrofauna. \n\n The San Clemente macrofauna seems to host intermediate species richness \n\nand diversity when compared to other cold seep areas. A total of 73 species were \n\nsampled at seep and non-seep habitats at San Clemente, with 58 species directly \n\nassociated with the siboglinid habitat. In the Gulf of Mexico, a similar number of \n\nspecies colonize seep vestimentiferan communities, indicating these are habitats \n\nhosting a species rich community (Bergquist et al. 2003). Shallower Californian seeps \n\nthat are characterized by the presence of clam-bed and microbial mat habitats host \n\nmore species than San Clemente (Levin et al. 2003), although this could be a result of \n\ndepth and habitat differences. Macrofauna diversity at San Clemente was lower in \n\nsediments nearby tubeworm thickets, but peaked at 10 meters due to the presence of \n\nseep and background species. The similar diversity levels between the siboglinid \n\nhabitat and background areas indicates that the San Clemente seep does not host a \n\nspecies-rich community if compared to background sediments. Comparisons among \n\nseep sites revealed that pogonophoran fields at the Gulf of Alaska have slightly lower \n\ndiversity than at San Clemente [Table 4.4; (Levin &amp; Mendoza 2007)]. The San \n\nClemente siboglinid habitat has similar diversity levels to the species rich Acharax \n\nbeds at Hydrate Ridge [Table 4.4; (Sahling et al. 2002)]. The high diversity found at \n\nthe siboglinid habitat is probably related to lower levels of pore water sulfides \n\n(Sahling et al. 2002). This relationship is clear at habitats dominated by Beggiatoa \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n132\u00a0\n\nmats and clam beds, which are typically highly sulphidic and frequently exhibit lower \n\ndiversity and higher faunal endemism [e.g. symbiont bearing organisms; (Tryon &amp; \n\nBrown 2001, Sahling et al. 2002, Levin et al. 2003, Levin 2005)]. \n\nTable 4.4. Comparison of macrofaunal diversity indexes at deep-sea seep sites grouped by \nhabitat type with published macrofaunal data. Depth in meters.  \n\n \n\nThe low level of species overlap between the macrofauna from organic falls \n\nand the San Clemente seep confirmed our second hypothesis. The San Clemente seep \n\nmacrofauna is dominated by chemosynthetic-symbiont species, while organic falls \n\nseem to host a broad number of enrichment opportunist organisms, sustaining only \n\njuvenile stages of chemosynthetic organisms. Sediments around whale, wood and \n\nkelp falls are massively colonized by dorvilleids and cumaceans, which are typical \n\nenrichment-opportunist respondents to the increased availability of organic sources \n\naround these islands. Considering levels sulfide availability and habitat persistence, \n\nwhale carcasses sustain chemosynthetic conditions most similar to cold seep and vent \n\necosystems (Treude et al. 2009). The broad number of seep-related taxa encountered \n\nat whale-falls give support to the evolutionary stepping stone hypothesis (Smith et al. \n\n1989). However, the San Clemente seep and whale sediment macrofauna did not \n\nexhibit high levels of similarity at the species level. The shared species between seep, \n\nwood and whale-falls are typically heterotrophic, and represented by deposit-feeding \n\npolychaetes such as ampharetids and paranoids. The overlap of the ampharetid \n\nAmellina cf. abyssalis between wood-falls and the San Clemente seep possibly \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n133\u00a0\n\nsuggests broad utilization of reducing habitats by this species. Amellina is distributed \n\nalong the Gulf of California, was highly abundant around wood-falls and has been \n\nencountered at deep-sea pockmarks in the Atlantic (Sumida et al. 2004). The low \n\nspecies overlap between seep and non-seep habitats is also influenced by the distinct \n\nmacrofaunal structure at San Clemente seep, which is dominated by the symbiont-\n\nbearing polychaete Siboglinum but is colonized by a few dorvilleids, which are \n\nabundant at organic falls and other seep sites. \n\n In summary, the San Clemente seep macrofauna sustains a high density of \n\nsiboglinid polychaetes in sediments within 1 meter from vestimentiferan tubeworm \n\ntickets. Within the siboglinid habitat, species richness and diversity were lower than \n\nbackground sediments, partly due to high dominance of a seep endemic fauna. The \n\nSan Clemente seep macrofauna sustains comparable diversity levels to similar \n\nhabitats at other seep areas, but is more diverse than highly sulphidic seep habitats \n\nsuch as bacterial mats and clam beds. Stable isotope analysis showed a wide \n\nvariability in the organic matter sources for the dominant species in the siboglinid \n\nhabitat, with most macrofaunal groups feeding heterotrophically. Overall, less than \n\n20% of the species overlapped between the San Clemente seep and wood-, whale- and \n\nkelp-fall communities at similar ocean depths within the region. This might be \n\npartially related to wide differences in sediment geochemistry and species \n\ncomposition between cold seeps and organic falls. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n134\u00a0\n\n4.5.

Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe present study focused at patterns of community structure and succession at \n\nartificially deployed parcels of wood, kelp and a large whale-fall; and investigated the \n\nsediment macrofauna from San Clemente cold seep. The first general hypothesis, that \n\ndistinct time courses of organic loading on sediments create spatial and temporal \n\ndifferences on macrofaunal colonization and succession, was confirmed. The transfer of \n\norganic detritus to the sediments around kelp and wood falls occurred at distinct time \n\nscales, creating small to intermediate scale organic disturbances in sediments nearby, and \n\nattracting dense numbers of organic opportunist and specialized species. The organic \n\ninput and bacterial degradation lead to the development of limited sedimentary reducing \n\nconditions around kelp and wood parcels, which limits chemoautotrophy to microbes.  \n\nAn end member of high quality organic matter, whale-falls create an intense and long-\n\nterm organic and sulfide enrichment (>4 years) on sediments nearby. However, the \n\nopportunistic successional stage at kelp, wood and whale-falls are remarkably similar in \n\nterms of species and trophic succession, albeit different magnitudes of organic \n\ndisturbance create very distinct temporal scales of succession. \n\nOur second hypothesis was also confirmed by the limited diversity levels \n\nobserved at sediments around kelp and wood parcels, which were markedly lower at \n\ntimes of intense organic enrichment. Although kelp and wood falls attract several \n\norganic-enrichment species not present on ambient deep-sea communities, and create \n\nmass effects dynamics for wood-borer specialists, these islands sustain lower levels of \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n144\u00a0\n\ndiversity if compared to whale-falls and background sediments. The lower diversity \n\nlevels at kelp and wood sediments can be related to two main processes: 1) the enhanced \n\ndominance of opportunistic species under conditions of organic enrichment, which was \n\necologically similar to patterns of succession following disturbance in shallow water, and \n\n2) the lower organic quality and scales of microbial degradation at these islands, which is \n\nunfavorable to sustain high levels of chemosynthesis by a rich and specialized fauna. The \n\nconsequences are that kelp and wood parcels, although attracting a sub set of specialized \n\nand rare fauna that likely contribute to regional and global levels of deep-sea diversity, \n\nand create favorable habitats for the stepping stone dispersal of species adapted to use \n\nthese parcels in deep-sea areas, host a reduced number of species if compared to whale-\n\nfalls. Time-scales and the intensity of organic availability contributes to the high levels of \n\ndiversity supported by whale carcasses in the deep-sea, which provide macrofauna \n\ncommunities with a variety of food sources for organisms adapted to utilize it. \n\nThe whale-fall macrofauna was also dominated by organic opportunist species \n\nthat were not typically observed in background sediments, but sulfophilic species also \n\nabounded between 4.5 to 6.8 y. The whale carcass studied was at the end of its organic \n\nenrichment stage, as indicated by the wide availability of free sediment sulfides and an \n\nabsence of broad sedimentary organic enrichment. Therefore, the wide range of organic \n\nsources available at later stages of succession at the whale carcass, favored the \n\ncolonization of a species-rich macrofauna, supporting our third hypothesis that whale-\n\nfalls increase local (and regional) levels of diversity in the deep-sea. The whale-fall \n\nsediments were ecologically analogous to the epifaunal communities that live attached to \n\nwhale bones, and exhibited one of the highest levels of diversity if compared similar \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n145\u00a0\n\nreducing habitats. The complex range of food sources and trophic associations in \n\norganisms that colonize these islands clearly promotes the high diversity levels \n\nencountered around whale carcasses. Although similar successional responses to the \n\norganic enrichment were observed between whale-, kelp- and wood-falls, there was a \n\nlimited number of overlapping species between these habitats, also supporting our third \n\nhypothesis. The high spatial and temporal variability on species composition at each \n\norganic island indicates the extreme diversity that deep-sea communities exhibit at small \n\nspatial scales. The specific responses to habitat dynamics and to varied food sources also \n\nsupports that organic islands have an unique role in maintaining dispersal and habitat \n\nsuitability for many species not present for wide distances on the typical soft sediment \n\necosystems in the deep-sea.  \n\nOur last hypothesis, that the San Clemente seep macrofauna had a limited number \n\nof specialists was partially confirmed, as indicated by the dominance of seep endemics in \n\nareas around worm clumps. However, seep sediments did not exhibit higher levels of \n\ndiversity if compared to background sediments, supporting our fourth hypothesis. The \n\ncontrast of community composition between seep and non-seep areas was typical of other \n\nseep sites. The dominance of a chemosynthetic-symbiont fauna at seep sediments with \n\nbroad utilization of other organic sources was also a common feature of the San Clemente \n\nand other seeps. The presence of a siboglinid bed at seep sediments and the long distance \n\nto the other organic islands, reduced levels of species overlap between these habitats. \n\nThe colonization and limited overlap of species between organic falls and seeps \n\nindicated that organic falls have the potential to sustain chemoautotrophically dependent \n\nspecies, and to create habitat heterogeneity at the typically oligotrophic deep seafloor. \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n146\u00a0\n\nTherefore, there is a great potential for organic falls to increase ? (regional) and ? \n\n(global) deep-sea diversity, as the frequency of occurrence of such organic islands across \n\ndeep-sea habitats is likely high. These islands provide food and substrate for generalized \n\nopportunists and a variety of specialists, which require sulfide-rich habitat islands to \n\ngrow and disperse. As these organic islands virtually occur at any location across wide \n\nocean basins, they might favor the dispersal of some species, acting as stepping-stones \n\nbetween long-term chemosynthetic habitats such as cold seeps and vents. Thus, \n\norganically enriched sediments around kelp-, wood- and whale-falls, which have received \n\nlittle study, may provide important habitat islands for the persistence and evolution of \n\nspecies at the deep-sea floor. Future studies addressing these organic islands, and their \n\nrelationship to the biota\u2019s of vents, seeps and whale falls need to consider the sediment \n\nassemblages residing in the underlying organically enriched sediments. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tCapa_tese\n\tIndice Tese\n\tAbstract\n\tCh1_Intro\n\tCh2_Kelp&amp;wood\n\tCh2_Kelp&amp;wood.2\n\tCh2_Kelp&amp;wood.3\n\tCH3_Whale\n\tCH3_Whale.2\n\tCH3_Whale.3\n\tCh4_SClemSeep\n\tCH5_Conclusions"}]}}}
