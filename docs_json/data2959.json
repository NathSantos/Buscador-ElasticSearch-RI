A\n\nCASE STUDY OF THE NORTHEAST OF BRAZIL\n\nNortheastern Brazilian coral reefs spread along about 3000 km of coastline. Many\ncommercially valuable species inhabit, temporarily or permanently, the reefs and provide food\nand employment for millions. However, the lack of basic knowledge, as for example\npopulation structure of exploited stocks, catch level, stock assessment, fishing effect on biota\netc, illustrate the need of an additional research regarding these ecosystems. The fishing\npressure on such environment is rising, partly as result of the technological and demographic\ndevelopment within these regions. Various studies already showed that the fishing pressure is\nincreasing and that many fish stocks are about to collapse or overexploited. This work, as part\nof the programme, funded by the Brazilian government, called REVIZEE (Assessment of the\npotential resources alive within the Economical Exclusive Zone of Brazil) that collected\ninformation on catch composition and biology of the main species within the EEZ, aimed to\nidentify and assess the factors that influence the fishery dynamic on coral reef using statistical\ntools as well as mathematical modelling. The ultimate objective of this study consist in a\ncontribution for the development of a management plan aiming at the sustainability of coral\nreef fishery in the Northeast of Brazil.\n\nWithin the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, snappers were the main part of the artisanal\ncatch and contributed most to the similarity between groups, outstanding the Lutjanus\nchrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu and in a lower extend, L. vivanus. Amongst the\nfactors considered, the spatial effect (state as a factor) appeared to be the strongest attribute in\nisolating groups in Northeast Brazil. Considering the technological factors, \u2018trip duration\u2019 best\ndiscriminates the catch composition when compared to \u2018fleet category\u2019. However, given some\nexceptions (mainly related to favourable strong winds), \u2018trip duration\u2019 categories are normally\nrelated to the fleet motion as motorised boats generally perform the longer trips.\n\nFor the five snappers considered, small fish were generally found near the coast in\nshallow waters and the larger fish were found off-shore in deeper waters. In terms of\nabundance, mean maximum relative abundance varied, as L. synagris was more abundant in\nshallow waters near the coast while L. vivanus mainly occurred in deeper waters on the\ncontinental shelf break and the slope. Gears caught similar size for all species and affected\nalmost the entire range of their life history, however, fleets with different operation capacities\naffected stocks on different ways.\n\nTraditional stock assessment models described the current status of L. analis, L.\nchrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris and L. vivanus of Northeast Brazil. Length based models were\nnot suitable for the studied species and may not be adequate for many other reef species.\nAlthough it may also be considered limited, due to the short time series, VPA (Virtual\nPopulation Analysis) based on age and true cohorts has shown to be the most appropriate,\nwithin the traditional methods applied for the assessment of the reef fish. In the overall,\ncaution should be taken on the exploitation levels. The five species were found at fully or\noverexploited status and that statement was enhanced when more conservative reference\npoints such as F0.1 was considered. Models that incorporate technical interaction were also\napplied. It appeared that different fleets played distinctive roles on the life history of the\nsnappers in Northeast Brazil.\n\nFishery independent information were used to get a picture of the fish biodiversity,\nwhere management attempts are set up, and to assess the relationship between catch-per-unit-\nof-effort (CPUE), through comparisons of abundance estimates obtained by underwater visual\n\n\n\nForewords\n\nxviii\n\ncensuses (UVC), with the inshore fishery survey. Fish composition varied accordingly to the\nhabitat type. CPUE estimates varied from UVC indexes on the overall. However, sampling\nperformed on \u2018knolls\u2019 for lutjanids were found similar. This may be explained by the fact that\nfish assemblage is restricted to a confined area where both survey methods present a similar\noperating range.\n\nThus, considering the results obtained through this work, the management plan in the\nNortheastern Brazil should encompass two actions: (1) effort reduction, i.e. of the fleet\ncategory that most influences the catch (motorised boats), and (2) implementation of areas\nthat restrict fishing activities.\n\n\n\nForewords\n\nxix\n\nResumo\n\nA PESCA SOBRE OS RECIFES DE CORAL E OS ECOSISTEMAS ADJACENTES: ESTUDO DE CASO\n\nDO NORDESTE DO BRASIL\n\nRecifes de coral da costa do Nordeste do Brasil ocupam aproximadamente 3000 km.\nMuitas esp\u00e9cies de alto valor comercial habitam temporariamente ou permanentemente nos\nrecifes e fornecem sustento e emprego para milhares de pessoas. Por\u00e9m, a falta de\nconhecimento b\u00e1sico como, por exemplo, a estrutura das popula\u00e7\u00f5es dos estoques\ncomercialmente explotados, o n\u00edvel das capturas, a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos estoques, o efeitos da pesca\nsobre a biota, etc, demonstram a necessidade de mais esfor\u00e7o no que diz respeito ao\nconhecimento destes ecossistemas. Sabe-se que a press\u00e3o pesqueira sobre esse tipo de\nambiente n\u00e3o para de crescer devido, em parte, ao desenvolvimento tecnol\u00f3gico e\ndemogr\u00e1fico destas regi\u00f5es. V\u00e1rios estudos mostraram que a press\u00e3o da pesca vem\naumentando e os estoques de peixes est\u00e3o colapsados ou sobre-explorados. Esse trabalho,\ninserido dentro do programa financiado pelo governo Brasileiro chamado REVIZEE\n(Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do Potencial dos Recursos Vivos da Zona Econ\u00f4mica Exclusiva) que coletou\ninforma\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da captura e biologia das principais esp\u00e9cies da Zona\nEcon\u00f4mica Exclusiva, teve como objetivo identificar e avaliar os fatores que determinam a\ndin\u00e2mica das pescarias nos recifes de coral, utilizando-se de ferramentas estat\u00edsticas e de\nmodelagem num\u00e9rica. O objetivo final deste estudo consiste em uma contribui\u00e7\u00e3o para a\nelabora\u00e7\u00e3o de um plano de manejo visando a explora\u00e7\u00e3o sustent\u00e1vel da pesca no ambiente de\nrecifes de coral do Nordeste do Brasil.\n\nDentro da pesca recifal da costa nordeste do Brasil, os lutjanideos foram parte\nimportante na captura da pesca artesanal e contribu\u00edram decisivamente para explicar a\nsimilaridade entre os grupos, destacando Lutjanus chrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu e,\nem uma menor propor\u00e7\u00e3o, L. vivanus. Dentre outros fatores considerados, o efeito espacial\n(estado como fator) foi o mais forte atributo respons\u00e1vel pelo isolamento de grupos.\nConsiderando os fatores tecnol\u00f3gicos, d?ura\u00e7\u00e3o da viagem m?elhor discriminou a composi\u00e7\u00e3o\nda captura quando comparado com c?ategoria da frota .? Entretanto, dadas algumas exce\u00e7\u00f5es\n(principalmente relacionadas com fortes ventos favor\u00e1veis), as categorias d?ura\u00e7\u00e3o da viagem\u00b4\ns\u00e3o normalmente relacionadas com a propuls\u00e3o da frota, uma vez que barcos motorizados\ngeralmente realizam viagens mais longas.\n\nPara os cinco lutjanideos analisados, os menores peixes foram geralmente encontrados\nperto da costa em \u00e1guas rasas e os maiores exemplares foram encontrados mais afastados da\ncosta em \u00e1guas mais profundas. Em termos de abund\u00e2ncia, a abund\u00e2ncia relativa m\u00e1xima\nm\u00e9dia variou, uma vez que L. synagris foi mais abundante em \u00e1guas rasas perto da costa\nenquanto que L. vivanus ocorreu principalmente em \u00e1guas mais profundas na plataforma\ncontinental e talude. As artes de pesca capturam indiv\u00edduos com tamanho similar para todas as\nesp\u00e9cies e afetam quase toda a faixa do ciclo de vida das mesmas, entretanto, frotas com\ndistintas opera\u00e7\u00f5es de pesca afetaram os estoques de maneira diferenciada.\n\nModelos de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos estoques tradicionais descreveram a situa\u00e7\u00e3o atual do L.\nanalis, L. chrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris e L. vivanus da costa nordeste do Brasil. Modelos\nbaseados em freq\u00fc\u00eancia de comprimento n\u00e3o se mostraram adequados para as esp\u00e9cies sob\nestudo e podem n\u00e3o ser adequados para muitas outras esp\u00e9cies recifais. Embora isto possa ser\nconsiderado limitante, devido a curta s\u00e9rie hist\u00f3rica, VPA (An\u00e1lise de Popula\u00e7\u00e3o Virtual)\nbaseado em idade e coortes verdadeiras mostrou ser o m\u00e9todo mais apropriado, considerando\n\n\n\nForewords\n\nxx\n\nas metodologias tradicionais aplicadas para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos estoques dos peixes recifais. De\numa maneira geral, os n\u00edveis de explora\u00e7\u00e3o devem ser avaliados com cautela. As cinco\nesp\u00e9cies foram classificadas como no limite m\u00e1ximo ou sobre-exploradas e essa conclus\u00e3o foi\nainda mais refor\u00e7ada quando pontos de refer\u00eancia mais conservativos como o F0.1 foi\nconsiderado. Modelos que incorporam intera\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas tamb\u00e9m foram aplicados. Ficou\nevidente que diferentes frotas atuam distintivamente na hist\u00f3ria de vida dos lutjanideos do\nnordeste do Brasil.\n\nInforma\u00e7\u00f5es independentes da pesca foram utilizadas visando a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de uma\nimagem da ictiofauna, onde medidas de manejo s\u00e3o implementadas e, para avaliar a rela\u00e7\u00e3o\nentre a captura-por-unidade-de-esfor\u00e7o (CPUE), atrav\u00e9s de compara\u00e7\u00f5es com as estimativas\nde abund\u00e2ncia obtidas atrav\u00e9s do censo visual (UVC), com a pesca experimental costeira. A\nictiofauna variou de acordo com a complexidade do ambiente. As estimativas de CPUE\nvariaram dos \u00edndices de UVC de uma maneira geral. Entretanto, para os lutjanideos,\namostragens efetuadas em cabe\u00e7os foram similar. Isto pode ser explicada pelo fato que a\ncomunidade de peixes \u00e9 restrita a \u00e1rea confinada onde ambos m\u00e9todos experimentais\napresentam uma faixa de opera\u00e7\u00e3o similar.\n\nFinalmente, considerando os resultados obtidos atrav\u00e9s deste estudo, um plano de\nmanejo para a regi\u00e3o nordeste do Brasil deve considerar duas a\u00e7\u00f5es: (1) redu\u00e7\u00e3o do esfor\u00e7o,\ni.e. na categoria de frota que mais influencia a captura (barcos motorizados) e (2)\nimplementa\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas com restri\u00e7\u00f5es a atividade pesqueira.\n\n\n\nForewords\n\nxxi\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9\n\nLES ACTIVITES DE PECHE SUR LES RECIFS CORALLIENS ET LES ECOSYSTEMES ADJACENTS.\n\nETUDE DE CAS DU NORD EST DU BRESIL\n\nLes r\u00e9cifs coralliens du Br\u00e9sil se distribuent sur environ 3000 km de c\u00f4te. Un grand\nnombre d\u2019esp\u00e8ces de poissons commercialement importantes vivent de fa\u00e7on temporaire ou\npermanente autour des r\u00e9cifs, et fournissent nourriture et emplois \u00e0 des millions de personnes.\nPourtant, en \u00e9cologie tropicale, tant fondamentale qu\u2019appliqu\u00e9e, le manque de donn\u00e9es de\nbase (structure des peuplements et en particulier des populations \u00e0 valeur commerciale,\nvaleurs des captures, \u00e9valuation des stocks, effets de la p\u00eache sur les \u00e9cosyst\u00e8mes, etc.)\nillustre le besoin de travaux suppl\u00e9mentaires dans ces milieux. Il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9 que de nombre\nr\u00e9cifs coralliens de part le monde font l\u2019objet d\u2019une pression de p\u00eache croissante. Dans\nplusieurs cas bien document\u00e9s, la pression de p\u00eache est telle que les captures de poissons se\nsont effondr\u00e9es ou ont, pour le moins, tr\u00e8s sensiblement diminu\u00e9 (\u201csurp\u00eache\u201d). Cette \u00e9tude\ntrouve sa place au sein du programme d\u2019\u00e9tude \u201cREVIZEE\u201d (Evaluation du potentiel des\nressources vivantes de la Zone Economique Exclusive Br\u00e9silienne) financ\u00e9 par le\ngouvernement br\u00e9silien , qui a collect\u00e9 un grand nombre de donn\u00e9es sur les esp\u00e8ces p\u00each\u00e9es\ncomme composition des captures et biologie.

Parmi les facteurs pris en consid\u00e9ration , l\u2019effet spatial (les \u00e9tats\ng\u00e9opolitiques \u00e9tant consid\u00e9r\u00e9s comme facteurs) parait \u00eatre l\u2019attribut pr\u00e9pond\u00e9rant. Si l\u2019on\nconsid\u00e8re les facteurs techniques, la \u00ab dur\u00e9e du voyage \u00bb discrimine mieux les captures que la\ncat\u00e9gorie de flottille. Pourtant, malgr\u00e9 quelques exceptions (principalement dues aux vents et\ncourants), la cat\u00e9gorie \u2018dur\u00e9e du voyage\u2019 est normalement li\u00e9e au mode de propulsion des\nflottilles, comme par exemple les bateaux motoris\u00e9s qui, en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, effectuent de plus longs\nparcours.\n\nPour les cinq esp\u00e8ces consid\u00e9r\u00e9es, les individus de petite taille ont g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e9t\u00e9\ncaptur\u00e9s pr\u00e9s de la c\u00f4te dans des eaux peu profondes par opposition avec les poissons de\ngrande taille qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 captur\u00e9s en eaux plus profondes.

General introduction\n\nI.I. The reef environment Regional setting\n\nThe study of Brazilian reefs began in 1828 with an expedition of the naturalist Spix and\n\nMartius (1828). Darwin (1841; 1851) followed by other few visiting scientists that described\n\nrestricted reef areas. However, the first complete description of the Brazilian coral reefs and\n\ntheir fauna was published by the biologist Jacques Laborel (1967) when he described the\n\nunusual characteristics of Brazilian coral reefs: the mushroom-like growth form, the strong\n\nendemism and the low diversity of the coral fauna (see for review Maida &amp; Ferreira, 1997;\n\nCastro &amp; Pires, 2001; Le\u00e3o et al., 2003). In the last two decades, an increased number of\n\nresearchers worked on the field of Brazilian reefs. These studies consisted mainly of mapping\n\nthe reef area (i.e. Maida &amp; Ferreira, 1997), studies of the reef fauna and flora (i.e. Le\u00e3o, 1986;\n\nFerreira &amp; Cava, 2001; Ferreira et al., 2001), characterisation of reef environment and related\n\nsedimentary facies (i.e. Araujo, 1984), as well as conservation issues related to reef ecosystem\n\n(IBAMA/FUNATURA, 1991).\n\nFig. I.1: Northeast of Brazil. Red dot are sampled sites. States: (CE) Cear\u00e1, (RN) Rio Grande do Norte, (PB)\nPara\u00edba, (PE) Pernambuco, (AL) Alagoas, (SE) Sergipe, (BA) Bahia\n\nCoral reef formations in Brazil extend for approximately 3000 km along the\n\nNortheastern coast (Maida &amp; Ferreira, 1997) (Fig. I.1). There are different types of reefs:\n\nbank reefs, fringing reefs and one atoll. They are constituted by organic substrates built with\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n2\n\ncoral, algae and mollusc skeletons. This region consists in a variety of habitats, including\n\nmangrove forests, fringing and platform reefs, and estuaries that act like inland extensions of\n\nthe continental shelf. Where the shelf narrows in the central section of the Northeast Brazil\n\nShelf region, the substrate consists almost entirely of carbonate sediments and is impacted by\n\nthe South Equatorial Current. The Brazilian reef present two outstanding features: their\n\nstructure and their coral composition. Reef structure called \u2018chapeir\u00f5es\u2019 are commonly\n\nobserved in Brazil. They consist of several mushroom-shaped coral colonies fused above,\n\nsome extending 20m high and 50m in diameter. These formation may fuse and form reef\n\nbanks which are found in the southern bound of reef range. Calcareous algae predominate\n\nalong the northern part of the Brazilian coast (Laborel &amp; Kempf, 1967; Maida &amp; Ferreira,\n\n1997; Le\u00e3o et al., 2003). Also unique to Brazilian reefs is their reef-building coral species\n\ncomposition. The diversity coral fauna (18 species) is low when compared to that of the\n\nCaribbean reefs, however, nearly half of it are endemic and some are relics of the ancient\n\ncoral fauna of the Tethys sea (Le\u00e3o et al., 2003). Eighteen species of stony corals\n\n(scleractinians), four hydrocorals, four antipatharians, and eleven octocorals constitute the\n\ncnidarian fauna of Brazil so far identified. The most common forms of stony coral in the\n\nBrazilian reefs are the three species of the genus Mussimilia: M. braziliensis, M. harttii and\n\nM. hispida. Among the endemic species, Favia gravida, is the most common on the\n\nNortheastern reefs. Most of the frame building corals are massive. Encrusting forms are\n\npresent along the edges of the reefs. Hydrocorals formed by the genus Millepora, present two\n\nmajor growth forms: branching and encrusting. Black corals form flat fan-shaped colonies\n\n(Antipathes sp.) or long branched colonies up to several meters long (Cirripathes sp.).\n\nAccording to Le\u00e3o (2003) Brazilian reefs are divided into four major sectors along the\n\ntropical coast: the northern, the northeastern, the eastern and the southern coasts. The area\n\nstudied included southern part of the northern sector, the Northeastern and north part of the\n\nEastern zone. It ranged from the State of Cear\u00e1 to the north part of the state of Bahia including\n\noceanic banks formed by the submarine mounts of Fernando de Noronha lined up east-west\n\n(Fig I.1). The only emerged peaks of the chain are the Atol das Rocas, the archipelago\n\nFernando de Noronha, and further north the Rochedos de S\u00e3o Pedro e S\u00e3o Paulo (Fig I.1).\n\nThen, the area is divided in two parts: the northern realm (States of Cear\u00e1, Rio Grande do\n\nNorte, and oceanic banks) and the northeastern part (states of Para\u00edba, Pernambuco, Alagoas,\n\nSergipe and the northern part of Bahia). The continental shelf varies from 45 to 60 km wide in\n\nCear\u00e1 and Rio Grande do Norte, then becomes relatively narrow in Pernambuco coasts (20\n\nkm), to wide again in the south of Bahia reaching 200 km. The shelf break is commonly\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n3\n\nfound between 80 and 100 m depth (Laborel, 1967; Mabesoone &amp; Coutinho, 1970; Maida &amp;\n\nFerreira, 1997; Le\u00e3o et al., 2003). The general atmospheric circulation pattern along the\n\nNortheast and East Brazilian coast is controlled by air masses from the South Atlantic high\n\npressure cell and advances of polar air masses. Dominant winds are southeasterly and easterly\n\ntrade winds. The Brazilian Current (BC) and the North Coastal Brazilian Current (NCBC) are\n\nthe main surface currents on the Brazilian continental margin. They originate from the South\n\nEquatorial Current (SEC) at about 5\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 S and flow to the south (BC) with average velocity\n\n50 to 70 cm-1, and to the North and Northwest (NBC) with a velocity reaching 30 cm-1\n\n(Stramma, 1991; da Silveira et al., 1994). During the austral winter between the 10\u00b0S and\n\n13\u00b0S (Sergipe and Northern Bahia) a reverse flow to the North may occur. North of 5\u00b0S the\n\nNorth Coastal Brazilian Current (NCBC) becomes stronger as a result of conjunction with the\n\nSEC. The range of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) along the northeastern Brazilian coast has\n\na low variation from 30\u00b0C during summer and fall (October to August) to 28\u00b0C during winter\n\n(March to September).\n\nThe Northern region is a marginal realm where reefs are sparse. The coast is sandy and\n\npresent reefs that grow as pinnacles in depth of 25 to 30 m. Oceanic Banks off this coast are\n\nthe remnants of volcanic cone of the Mid-Atlantic ridge (Mabesoone &amp; Coutinho, 1970) that\n\nrises steeply from great depths. These submarine mountain tops range between 40 and 300 m\n\ndeep. The region is under the influence of the northern strong onshore winds, trade winds, and\n\nof the northern branch of the South Atlantic Equatorial Current. The water average\n\ntemperature is 27\u00b0C in summer and 22\u00b0C in winter (Le\u00e3o et al., 2003).\n\nReefs abound on the inner shelf of the Northeastern region. The coral build-ups are\n\ngenerally patch of elongated bank reefs, but some attached banks are present as well (Le\u00e3o et\n\nal., 2003). The major current influencing the area is the Brazilian current which flows\n\nsouthward and in a lesser extend the North Brazilian Current flowing northward, also there\n\nare wind driven with varying speed and direction. The northeastern coast is dominated by the\n\nSoutheastern and Eastern trade winds originated by two elements: the general atmospheric\n\ncirculation pattern along the Northeast and East coast and air masses generated in the South\n\nAtlantic high pressure cell and polar air masses.\n\nAlthough geological history of sandstone banks is poorly known, their formation is\n\nlinked to the complex relative movements of the continental margin and the variations of the\n\nsea levels in the past (Mabesoone &amp; Coutinho, 1970). As a general pattern, the northeastern\n\ncontinental shelf vertical profile can be divided into three zones: (i) the inner shelf, (ii) the\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n4\n\nouter shelf and (iii) the shelf break and the slope, another category may be add with oceanic\n\nbanks, atoll and archipelago:\n\n(i) The principal coastal feature consists of sandstone banks and superficial coral reef\n\nthat are arranged in lines parallel to the coastline that can reach 10 km long by 60m width\n\n(Laborel &amp; Kempf, 1967). Breaks along these lines occur at bays which usually contain small\n\nmangrove systems whenever river is present (Maida &amp; Ferreira, 1997). From 10 to 20 m deep,\n\na transitional zone, a mosaic of mud flats (due to river discharge) and areas made of sand and\n\ncalcareous algae can be observed.\n\n(ii) The outer shelf, from 20 to 80 m deep, presents a bottom rather smooth where\n\ncalcareous algae, Mesobeliaceas spp and Lithothamnium spp, cover large part of the area\n\n(Kempf et al., 1970). Some uneven areas with downs and high, called \u2018canais\u2019 occur on the\n\nexternal bound and run parallel to the shelf break (Kempf et al., 1970).\n\n(iii) The shelf break looks like a wall where the depth fall abruptly from 80 m to 500 m\n\nwithin 2 nautical miles, then the slope become more gradual with an inclination of 2\u00b0 to 3\u00b0\n\n(Kempf et al., 1970).\n\nThe East Brazil large marine ecosystem (LME) has a low productivity (<150 gC/m2/yr)\n\n(Stuhr, 1996). It has a more diverse food web than the large marine ecosystems to the North\n\nand to the South, but has lower production. Studies on primary productivity for this LME are\n\nscant. The Victoria Eddy along the eastern shelf edge (see Schmid et al., 1995) creates an\n\nupwelling of nutrient-rich South Atlantic Central Water (see Gaeta et al., 1999), leading to\n\nhigher primary production rates. This LME is a transition zone in terms of the distribution\n\npatterns of the different taxonomic groups and the microplankton. It is influenced both by\n\nnorthern tropical warm waters and by southern colder upwellings (see Ekau, 1999).\n\nI.II. Biogeography of Brazilian reef fishes\n\nAlthough the reef ichthyofauna of the western Atlantic has been substantially studied,\n\nthe reef fish of the Brazilian waters are still poorly known (Floeter et al., 2001). Until the\n\n1980\u2019s the Brazilian reef ichthyofauna was believed to be composed by Caribbean species\n\n(Moura et al., 1999). Nowadays, various species were found endemic of the Western South\n\nAtlantic although very similar to their Caribbean counterparts (Floeter &amp; Gasparini, 2000).\n\nThe Brazilian reef fish fauna comprises around 320 species (Floeter &amp; Gasparini, 2001). From\n\nthese, 57 species were restricted to the southwestern Atlantic (Floeter &amp; Gasparini, 2001).\n\nRecently, two concurrent theories about the Brazilian endemism have been presented.\n\nThe first idea is that a separate evolution of the northern and southern reef fishes population\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n5\n\noccurred as the Amazonian river represents a strong barrier through the discharge of a large\n\namount of sediment and freshwater and that is probably the major reason of the Brazilian\n\nendemism (Rocha, 2003). An alternative proposition was that the Amazon area, because of its\n\nlarge influence and mainly due to the low salinity, has created an endemism area extending\n\nfrom the north of Brazil to the Cear\u00e1 (Joyeux et al., 2001). Therefore, the Amazonian river\n\nwould not be an unbridgeable barrier for species (as various species from Caribbean islands\n\ndo occur along the Brazilian coast).\n\nThere is a considerable homogeneity in the composition of the reef fauna within the\n\nBrazilian province (ranging from the Amazon delta to south Brazil), although there may be\n\nsome differences between regions that present divergent salinity water temperature or reef\n\ntype (Floeter &amp; Gasparini, 2000). In the northeast of Brazil, main differences in diversity\n\noccur between continental environment and island (Floeter &amp; Gasparini, 2000; Floeter et al.,\n\n2001; Ara\u00fajo &amp; Feitosa, in press). Haemulids and lutjanids, well represented on the Brazilian\n\nreef formation (high number of species), are very little or absent on oceanic islands such as\n\ni.e. Fernando de Noronha (Floeter et al., 2001).\n\nI.III. Data collection\n\nMost of the data for this study were collected as part of a national program called\n\nREVIZEE (Evaluation of the Potential of the Live Resources from Brazilian Exclusive\n\nEconomic Zone), which was established in 1996. The program was set up in a\n\nmultidisciplinary way and information on geology, physic oceanography, chemistry, and\n\nbiology of species inhabiting the Brazilian waters was gathered. The fish and fishery sub-\n\nprogram gathered information along the Brazilian coast on exploited fish population in order\n\nto determine population dynamics and estimate biomass levels of economically important fish\n\nresources. Our data came from the area encompassing five Brazilian states (Cear\u00e1, Rio\n\nGrande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Bahia, see Fig. I.1) during 5 years of sampling\n\nprogram. It was gathered information regarding the fishing tactics (fishing area, gear used,\n\ntarget groups, etc) and catch composition of fleet operating in the region. Fish were identified,\n\nmeasured and weighed. Biological material was collected for the development of age and\n\ngrowth studies as well as reproduction. This work already generated several M.Sc. thesis\n\n(Teixeira, 1998; Rezende, 1999; Diedhiou, 2000) and other scientific work (Diedhiou et al.,\n\n2003; Rezende et al., 2003; Ferreira et al., 2004a; 2004b; 2004c; 2004d; Rezende &amp; Ferreira,\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n6\n\n2004). Another program \u2018Projeto Recifes Costeiros\u20191 complemented the dataset available on\n\nthe artisanal fishery in Pernambuco as well as on the local Tamandar\u00e9 s? fish fauna through\n\nunderwater visual censuses. Results from the data collection from the \u2018Projeto Recifes\n\ncosteiros\u2019 gave support to the design of the REVIZEE program concerning reef fisheries in\n\nthe Northeast of Brazil.\n\nFisheries statistics in Brazil have been collected by many public institutions (SUDEPE,\n\n1967-1979; IBGE, 1980-1989; IBAMA, 1990-2001)2. From the 1990\u2019s, the program called\n\nESTATPESCA run by the IBAMA was set up in order to collect fishery statistics from marine\n\nand estuarine ecosystem along the Brazilian coast. The information collected comprised each\n\nlanding by vessel category, its production at species level, the gear category used, the cruise\n\nnumber and the fishing ground (Estatpesca, 2000). In the Northern Brazil (study area), 324\n\nsampling sites were chosen for estimation of the total production (by the program\n\n\u2018Estatpesca\u2019) of the target species and control of technological characteristics of the\n\nNortheastern area.\n\nI.IV. Species of genus Lutjanus\n\nGenerally demersal, the snappers are tropical and sub tropical species that are\n\ndistributed on reefs down to depths about 450 m (Allen, 1985; Polovina &amp; Ralston, 1987).\n\nTop predators, they consume a broad range of prey generally dominated by fish and macro\n\ninvertebrate at the adult stage (Allen, 1985; Nagelkerken et al., 2000).\n\nLutjanids are daily and nocturnally active, but in contrast to diurnally active only\n\nspecies they do not seem to feed during daytime (Polovina &amp; Ralston, 1987; Nagelkerken et\n\nal., 2000). Juveniles migrate out of the mangrove and patch reefs to the adjacent seagrass beds\n\nto feed on invertebrates. Commonly, adults that shelter on the coral reef by day migrate to the\n\nadjacent seagrass beds at night to feed. The selection of the feeding site appears to be\n\ndetermined by the presence and abundance of their preferred food items (i. e. Tanaidacea,\n\nDecapoda, and small fishes) (Allen, 1985; Duarte &amp; Garcia, 1999; Nagelkerken et al., 2000).\n\nLutjanids present two types of reproduction pattern: continental species spawn during\n\nthe extended summer period whereas island population present an all-year round spawning\n\n1 Projeto Recifes Costeiros: Program that aims to preserve coral reefs, beaches and mangroves along the\nprotected area \u2018APA Costa dos Corais\u2019 through a sustainable management of the area. The protected area covers\nover 413 thousands Ha along a coastline 130 km long between the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas.\nManagement actions taken are socio-political, scientific and educational.\n\n2 Brazilian fisheries statistic: Superintend\u00eancia do Desenvolvimento da Pesca (SUDEPE), 1967-1979;\nInstituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica (IBGE), 1980-1989; Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos\nRecursos Naturais Renov\u00e1veis IBAMA, 1990-2001.\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n7\n\nseason (Grimes, 1987). They produce eggs with pelagic dispersion (Grimes, 1987).\n\nCommonly long lived species, i.e. over 50 years for L. campechanus (Wilson &amp; Nieland,\n\n2001), they generally show low growth and natural mortality rates (Manickchanddass, 1987;\n\nManooch, 1987; Polovina &amp; Ralston, 1987; Davis &amp; West, 1992; Milton et al., 1995; Rocha-\n\nOlivares, 1998; Hodd &amp; Johnson, 1999; Cappo et al., 2000; Hood &amp; Johnson, 2000;\n\nLuckhurst et al., 2000; Newman et al., 2000; Burton, 2001; Newman, 2001; Patterson III et\n\nal., 2001; Wilson &amp; Nieland, 2001; Burton, 2002)\n\nOur study focused on five species of Lutjanus, which inhabit from coastal to deep\n\ndemersal waters. The main species caught by the artisanal fishery in Northeast of Brazil were\n\nstudied: the mutton snapper L. analis (Cuvier, 1828), the yellowtail snapper L. chrysurus\n\n(Bloch, 1791), the dog snapper L. jocu (Bloch and Schneider, 1801), the lane snapper L.\n\nsynagris (Linnaeus, 1758) and the silk snapper L. vivanus (Cuvier, 1828) (Fig. I.2).\n\nLutjanus analis occurs in continental shelf areas as well as clear waters around islands\n\n(Cervig\u00f3n et al., 1992). Large adults are usually found among rocks and coral while juveniles\n\noccur over sandy, vegetated (usually Thalassia) bottoms and mangrove systems (Cervig\u00f3n et\n\nal., 1992). They form small aggregations, which disband during the night (Allen, 1985) and\n\nfeed both day and night on fishes, shrimps, crabs, cephalopods, and gastropods (Allen, 1985).\n\nIt has been reported individuals reaching 30 years old (Rezende et al., 2003).\n\nL. chrysurus inhabits coastal waters, mostly around coral reefs. They are usually seen\n\nwell above the bottom, frequently in aggregations. Young individuals are usually found over\n\nweed beds. Adults feed on a combination of plankton and\n\nbenthic animals including fishes, crustaceans, worms, gastropods and cephalopods.\n\nJuveniles feed primarily on plankton (Lieske &amp; Myers, 1994). Spawning occurs throughout\n\nthe year, with peaks at different times in different areas (Smith, 1997; Diedhiou, 2000). In the\n\nnorthern Brazil, 18-year-old fishes were reported (Diedhiou et al., 2003).\n\nAdults of L. jocu are common around rocky or coral reefs. Young individuals are found\n\nin estuaries and occasionally enters rivers. They feed mainly on fishes and benthic\n\ninvertebrates, including shrimps, crabs, gastropods and cephalopods (Allen, 1985).\n\nIndividuals that aged 25 year old were reported in the northeastern Brazil (Ferreira et al.,\n\n2004c; Rezende &amp; Ferreira, 2004).\n\nL. synagris inhabits shallow coastal waters and is found over all types of bottom, but\n\nmainly around coral reefs and on vegetated sandy areas, in turbid as well as clear water\n\n(Lieske &amp; Myers, 1994). L. synagris often forms aggregations, specially during the breeding\n\nseason. They feed at night on small fishes, bottom-living crabs, shrimps, worms, gastropods\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n8\n\nand cephalopods. Nineteen-year-old individuals were reported in the western Atlantic\n\n(Luckhurst et al., 2000) and up to 22-year-old individuals in Brazil (Ferreira et al., 2004d).\n\nL. vivanus is common near the edge of the continental and island shelves; also found in\n\ndeeper waters (below 200 m); usually ascending to shallow water at night. It feeds mainly on\n\nfishes, shrimps, crabs, gastropods, cephalopods, tunicates and some pelagic items including\n\nurochordates (Polovina &amp; Ralston, 1987). L. vivanus is a restricted spawner in the continental\n\npart while its insular counterpart spawn all year round (Polovina &amp; Ralston, 1987).\n\nI.V. Reef fishery in Brazil. The case of snappers\n\nThe Northeast coast is one of the country\u2019s most densely populated coastal regions, with\n\nthe State of Pernambuco standing out as the epicentre of this concentration (Moraes, 1999).\n\nTo supply food and economic resources the Brazilian reef fishes are intensively exploited by\n\nartisanal fisheries that concentrate on the reef formations distributed along the continental\n\nshelf up to the continental slope and over oceanic banks (Ferreira et al., 1998; Ferreira &amp;\n\nMaida, 2001).\n\nAccording to Ferreira et al. (2000), fisheries in Brazilian reefs may be divided into two\n\ntypes. First, the activity of recreational and artisanal scale fishers occurs nearby the coast in\n\nshallow waters and reefs formations. Fishing point may be reached by swimming or using\n\nrowing or sailing canoes. Second, the medium scale commercial fisheries that operates by the\n\ncoastal part of the shelf, using sailing or motorised boats that reach deeper waters as far as the\n\nshelf break. Only motorised boats, that may operate also on the banks far from the coast,\n\nhave storing capacity (Ferreira &amp; Maida, 2001).\n\nAlong the Northeastern coast, snappers represent one of the main resources for the\n\nartisanal fishery in terms of abundance and fishers income (Santos, 2001). Lutjanids\u2019 catches\n\nin the Northeast Brazil ranged between 11341 tonnes during the 60\u2019s, that represented 34% of\n\nthe catch in this decade, and 77422 tonnes during the 80\u2019s, 43% of the catch (Fig. I.3).\n\nDuring the 60 s? and 70 s?, the most targeted species in Northeast Brazil was the red snapper,\n\nLutjanus purpureus (Poey 1866), and in minor proportions, L. analis. From 1978 with the\n\ncollapse of the red snapper fishery, others species as L. jocu, L. chrysurus, and more recently,\n\nL. synagris, constitute the major part of the lutjanids catch in Northeast Brazil (65%) (Fig. I.3)\n\n(SUDEPE, 1967-1979; IBGE, 1980-1989; IBAMA, 190-2001). Amongst the four main states\n\nof the Northeast of Brazil, Cear\u00e1 was responsible for the highest catches of species of the\n\ngenus Lutjanus with catches up to 8200 tonnes per year. However, from 1986, the Lutjanids\u2019\n\ncatches have shown a decreasing trend since catches in the state of Cear\u00e1 declined sharply.\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n9\n\nThe decreasing trend in landings of the Lutjanus species in Pernambuco was also observed\n\nsince 1968. This trend was directly related to the collapse of the main species L. purpureus\n\nthat reached its maximum in 1981 when 6800 tonnes were landed. By this time, L. purpureus\n\nwas responsible for 70% of the total of snappers landed in northeastern Brazil and almost all\n\ncatches were from Cear\u00e1 fishing activities (6700 tonnes). L. purpureus s? catches in\n\nPernambuco showed a decline since 1968 and, by 1988, this species was nearly absent. In the\n\nlast two years (2000 and 2001), L. purpureus only represented 18% of the total catches of\n\nLutjanus species (1100 tonnes in average). Conversely, the relative contribution of other\n\nspecies of Lutjanus in the total catch was increasing, specially in Bahia, that steadily\n\nincreased its Lutjanids catches since 1968.\n\nAlthough L. purpureus is of a great value for the Northern Brazil fishery it is, currently,\n\nexclusively targeted by the industrial sector, because of their aggregating property and also\n\ndue to over-fishing. Nowadays, L. purpureus is not only caught within the northeastern shelf\n\nalthough it can be landed in ports of the region (mainly in Fortaleza \u2013 Cear\u00e1). Therefore this\n\nspecies was not included into our analyses.\n\nLutjanus analis\n\nLutjanus synagris\n\nLutjanus chrysurus\nLutjanus jocu\n\nLutjanus vivanus Lutjanus purpureus\n\nLutjanus analis\n\nLutjanus synagris\n\nLutjanus chrysurus\nLutjanus jocu\n\nLutjanus vivanus Lutjanus purpureus\n\nFig. I.2: Lutjanus species considered in the study (source all species \u2018Projeto Recifes Costeiros\u2019 except L.\nchrysurus, L. vivanus and L. purpureus www.fishbase.org)\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n10\n\nFig. I.3 Lutjanids\u2019 catch time series from 1967 to 2001.

General objectives of the thesis\n\nTropical snappers are widely distributed throughout the tropical seas of the world\n\n(Allen, 1985). In Brazil, snappers are of particular commercial interest mainly for the artisanal\n\nfishery. The exploitation, in terms of catch levels, is carried out with relatively high\n\nexploitation rates from many decades. However, no stock assessment for the elaboration of a\n\nmanagement plan for a sustainable exploitation has been carried out in Brazil for such\n\nresource. The program REVIZEE represented the first attempt to run a comprehensive stock\n\nassessment including the multifleet and multispecies characteristics of the fishery.\n\nThis study aims to assess the current status of the artisanal fishery of the Northeast\n\nBrazil through the exploitation of its main resource, the Lutjanidae family, and to help\n\nimproving future sampling programs for stock assessment and management in the\n\nnortheastern Brazilian framework.\n\nI.VII. Specific objectives and description of the chapters\n\nThis study, set up within a multigear and multispecific framework, has the main\n\nobjective to evaluate the factors which drive the dynamics of the reef fishery in Northeast\n\nBrazil, using statistical analysis and modelling tools. The final goal of this study is to provide\n\nsuggestions for a management plan for the reef fishery in the Northeast Brazil.\n\nThe specific objectives of the study are:\n\n1. Identify, describe and quantify the factors that influence the reef fishery in Northeast\n\nBrazil using uni- and multivariate approaches; (Chapter 2)\n\n2. Evaluate the relationship between the species distribution of snappers in the water\n\ncolumn and the fishery distribution. The Lutjanidae family will be chosen as its gather\n\nthe main species related to the reef environment in the Northeast Brazil. (Chapter 3)\n\n3. Evaluate the stocks of Lutjanus spp. based on traditional approaches used in fishery\n\nscience (Chapter 4);\n\n4. Once the factors that influence the fishery, the multispecific nature of the reef fishery\n\nand the competition among fishers with different gear/fleets are identified, models\n\nincluding technological interactions will be applied in order to estimate the\n\nexploitation rates, biomass and productivity of fish stocks most important in the reef\n\ncommunity (Chapter 5);\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\n12\n\n5. Validate the estimates of biomass derived from the indirect models (Chapters 4 and 5)\n\nwith direct estimates of population abundance/biomass based on Visual Census\n\nTechniques (Chapter 6);\n\n6. Suggest management measures for the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil (general\n\ndiscussion \u2013 Chapter 7).\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n13\n\nChapter II. Dynamics of reef fishery in the Northeast Brazil: a\n\nunivariate and multivariate approach\n\nII.I. Introduction\n\nOne of the main purposes of a fishery management plan is the adaptation of the catch to\n\nthe potential of the exploitable resources (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992). In multispecific fishery,\n\na common situation on coral reefs, regulations based on unispecific assessment have already\n\nshown their limitations (Polunin &amp; Roberts, 1996). Fisheries science has recognised that fish\n\nspecies do not exist in isolation from one to another and that they are not harvested\n\nindependently (Dann, 1987; Magnusson, 1995; Jennings et al., 2001). Technical interactions\n\narise when gear (or rather the fleet in a artisanal multigear fishery) comes into contact with\n\nstocks of different species resulting in a mixed catch. Technical interaction may also arise\n\nwhen co-existing fleets exploit the same resource (Lucena et al., 2002).\n\nThe reef ecosystem present a great number of species packed on small spatial dimension\n\n(Longhurst &amp; Pauly, 1987). The fishery dynamics of reef communities and fishing impacts\n\nare better described when considered their multidimensional aspects (multispecific, multigear,\n\nmultifleet, spatial and temporal variations). In the case of exploited fishes, the identification\n\nand the quantification of factors influencing the dynamics of the fishing activities and the\n\nstructure of this community appear to be necessary in a management framework. This strategy\n\nwould help to foreseen the effects and hence to qualify and quantify the variables that\n\ninfluence the fishery dynamics.\n\nThe study of the fleet dynamics and their fishing strategy, through the analysis of the\n\ndiversity of their catch composition, is an important part in fishery ecology (Hilborn, 1985).\n\nSuch research\u2019s line is particularly useful in the case of multispecific and multigear fishery\n\n(Murawski et al., 1983; Biseau &amp; Gondeaux, 1988). In fisheries that do not provide sufficient\n\nand/or accurate, reliable commercial fishery data, analysis based on catch composition\n\nprovides an objective and quantitative alternative means of classification (He et al., 1997). In\n\nthis study the data quality was not homogeneous within the entire dataset. Many landings\n\npresented missing data either on the biological aspect or on the abiotic aspect. Therefore such\n\nrobust methods were recommendable. Several studies have already looked at the\n\ncharacterisation of the fleet dynamics using multivariate methods (Pauly, 1980b; He et al.,\n\n1997; Pitcher et al., 1998; Preikshot &amp; Pauly, 1998; Pelletier &amp; Ferraris, 2000). These\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n14\n\ntechniques are useful to obtain an integrated picture of the structure of the system, the factors\n\nthat characterise the fishing activity and also the comprehension of the adaptive fisher\u2019s\n\ntechniques to the biological and ecological characteristics of the target species. Furthermore, a\n\nmultivariate approach would improve the definition of a new typology of fishing activity in\n\norder to best define technological categories for fishing statistics.\n\nMany community data sets show some a priori defined structure. In the Northeast\n\nBrazilian fishery, a vessel may carry more than one gear and a vessel with similar\n\ntechnological characteristics may reach different grounds. The qualification and quantification\n\nof the factors that influence the catch are essential for the development of a management plan.\n\nThis chapter aims to identify, describe and quantify the factors that influence the reef\n\nfishery in Northeast Brazil using, in a first step, an univariate approach completed by a\n\nmultivariate approach. In this context, the homogeneity of the Brazilian reef fishery, in terms\n\nof spatial distribution (variation between states and/or distance to the coast) and technological\n\ninteractions was examined looking at the catch composition by state, by gear (when only one\n\ngear was used), by vessel and by the \u2018trip duration\u2019 categories. It should be noted that the\n\nconcept of state was not only geopolitical unit but also a geomorphological and socio-cultural\n\nunit.\n\nII.II. Material and methods\n\nII.II.1. Data\n\nData have been collected for five years (from 1996 to 2000) within the REVIZEE\n\nframework (Chapter I), a local program that aimed to gather information on the Brazilian\n\nmarine ecosystem within the Exclusive Economic zone (EEZ), in 10 landing sites of the\n\nartisanal reef fishery along 5 states of the Northeastern coast of Brazil: Cear\u00e1 (CE), Rio\n\nGrande do Norte (RN), Pernambuco (PE), Alagoas, (AL), Bahia (BA) (Fig. I.1). The study\n\nwas based on interviews obtained during landings where information on the fishery (date,\n\nname of the vessel, landing site, fishing grounds, depth, time at sea and moon phase), vessel\n\ncategory (vessel type, gear, motion power and number of fishers) and landings (catches\n\nidentified at species level, size of individuals and sometimes weight) were recorded. From\n\nvessels that exploited reef fishes (hereafter, \u2018reef fishes\u2019 means a species that may occur on\n\nreefs but is not necessarily restricted to reef), one hundred eighty seven species were reported.\n\nSpecies considered as \u2018rare\u2019 were excluded from the study. The selective criterion included\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n15\n\nthe species that represent more than 1% of the total catch (in number of individuals) or\n\nspecies present in the catch of more than 5% of the vessel sampled. In addition, care was\n\ntaken to not exclude species that would be important in some state and inexistent in others.\n\nAbundance by state was analysed but no further species were reintegrated in the analysis. The\n\ndataset became 1667 landings and 60400 individuals in 37 species (Table II.1)\n\nTable II.1: Main species caught by the artisanal reef fishery along the Northeast Brazil.

Methods\n\nClarke and Warwick (1994) defined a framework for the study of changes in\n\ncommunity structure. Fish assemblage analysis may pass by 3 stages: representation of the\n\nassemblage, discrimination of site or conditions and links between abiotic factors and species\n\nassemblage. In a fishery point of view, the analysis of the catch aims at determining species\n\nthat drive the fishing dynamic, discriminating fishing techniques or fishing conditions and\n\nidentifying what factor may influence the catch composition.\n\nWithin this framework, statistical tools used in ecological studies are grouped into two\n\ncategories: the univariate and the multivariate methods.\n\nThe univariate techniques condense the full set of species counts for a sample into a\n\nsingle coefficient, for example an index of the diversity or an indicator species coefficient.\n\nFor diversity indexes, traditional statistical methods, such as analysis of variance (ANOVA)\n\nor regression techniques, may be applied.\n\nMost of multivariate techniques work on the principle of similarity coefficients\n\ncalculated between every pair of sample. These, then, may facilitate either a classification of\n\nsamples or descriptors into groups (clustering) or an ordination plot in which samples or\n\ndescriptors are mapped according to their similarity (distances between pair of items reflect\n\ntheir relative dissimilarity). One may choose amongst various (dis)similarity coefficients, also\n\ncalled \u2018metrics of community structure\u2019, present in the literature (Rice, 2000). Then,\n\nrepresenting communities may be done by dendrograms, and multidimensional scaling (MDS)\n\nplots. The clustering techniques link samples in groups on the basis of (dis)similarity\n\ndefinition. The MDS method distribute spatially (usually in two or three dimensions) samples\n\nin such way that the rank order of distances agrees with the rank order of the similarities\n\n(Clarke, 1993; Legendre &amp; Legendre, 1998). The discrimination of groups of sites or\n\nconditions may be tested by analysis of similarities techniques (ANOSIM) and species\n\ncontributing for such similarity within each group and/or dissimilarity between groups may be\n\nidentified. Ultimately, having treated biological information independently, any associated\n\nabiotic factors matched to the same set of samples can be examined for their own structure\n\nand its relation to the biotic pattern.\n\nII.II.2.1. Factor and data matrices\n\nIn the Northeast Brazil, 4 factors were thought to be relevant as descriptor of fishing\n\ntactics: \u2018state\u2019, \u2018vessel category\u2019, \u2018gear\u2019, and \u2018trip duration\u2019. The \u2018trip duration\u2019 category is\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n17\n\nusually related to the vessel characteristics (propulsion, storing and catch preservation\n\ncapacity) and hence the fishing grounds that could be reached. Motorised vessels typically\n\neffectuate longer trips and are able to reach fishing grounds further away from the coast.\n\nHowever, this cannot be generalised, as sailing boats may reach deeper water when driven by\n\nfavourable winds. Thus, in order to identify what is the best descriptor between vessel\n\ncategory and trip duration, two ordination analysis that consider two sets of factor were tested:\n\n(1) state, vessel and gear, (2) state, trip duration, and gear.\n\nConsidering the \u2018trip duration\u2019 as category, each sampled vessel were discriminated by\n\nstate and by 4 categories (Table II.2). Each state is identified by a two letters code: Cear\u00e1\n\n(CE), Rio Grande do Norte (RN), Pernambuco (PE), Alagoas (AL) and Bahia (BA). For\n\nexample, sample grouped as CEA is designated for landings recorded in Cear\u00e1 that presented\n\na trip duration less than two days. CEB is the code related to landings recorded in Cear\u00e1 that\n\npresented a trip duration between two and five days, etc. Fleet categories were designated as\n\n\u2018paquete\u2019 (PQT), \u2018jangada\u2019 (JAN), \u2018sailing boats\u2019 (BOV), \u2018motorised boats\u2019 (BOM) and\n\n\u2018mixed propulsion boats\u2019 (BOT) (Table II.3). Finally, the three main gears categories\n\nconsidered were line, gill net and trap\n\nTable II.2: Trip duration category and equivalent fishing ground type.\n\nCategory Trip duration mean Depth (m) Fishing typology\n\nA &lt;2 days 33\nFishing activity during the same day/fishing\ncrepuscular time and in the following\nmorning at rising time\n\nB 2 \u2013 5 days 61 Fishing along the shelf to the shelf break\nincluding canals\n\nC 5 \u2013 9 days 81 Fishing along the shelf break and the slope\n\nD >9 days 81\nFishing from the shelf break to the oceanic\nbanks\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n18\n\nTable II.3Fleet category description.\n\nFleet type Code\nDepth range (m)\n\n25% - median - 75%\nDescription\n\nPaquete PQT 8 - 12 - 24\nSail, wood-made, flat shell without keel nor cabine\nSize<6m, no storing capacity\n\nJangada JAN 14 - 30 - 42\nSail, wood-made, flat shell without keel nor cabine\nstoring capacity (isotherm box)\n\nBote \u00e0 vela BOV 43 - 73.5 - 96\nSail, cabine, storing capacity size<15m\nstoring capacity, ice\n\nBote motorizado BOM 41 - 52.5 - 93\nMotorised, cabine, storing capacity size<15m\nstoring capacity, ice\n\nBote BOT 82 - 93 - 115\nSail and motor facilities, cabine, storing capacity size<15m\nstoring capacity, ice\n\nII.II.2.2. Characterisation of fishing types\n\nBoth cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling were used. Both techniques were\n\nfound \u2018complementary\u2019 to each other when viewed in combination, specially when the stress\n\nvalue of an MDS plot reaches high values (considered high at 0.2). The stress value represents\n\nthe \u2018adequacy\u2019 of a MDS representation. Clarke (1993) found that stress values lower than 0.2\n\nwere acceptable. Due to the high number of sampled vessels, samples were averaged over\n\ngroups constituted by state x (trip duration or vessel) x gear used. This showed a remarkably\n\nsimple pattern analogous to an \u2018additive model\u2019 for main effects in standard univariate\n\nanalyses (Clarke &amp; Gorley, 2001). Hierarchical complete linkage cluster and\n\nMultidimensional scaling (MDS) analyses were used to discriminate landings (averaged by\n\ngrouping factors) sampled along the Northeastern coast of Brazil. This characterisation was\n\ncarried out by considering the pre-defined grouping factors (gears, state, and trip duration or\n\nvessel category) that were considered relevant in defining the artisanal northeastern reef\n\nfishery.\n\nClustering analysis aims to reduce the number of studied objects (individuals) by\n\ngrouping them in homogeneous classes. The entire following analysis was based on non-\n\nmetric properties combining cluster and MDS and since the precise similarity value will not\n\nhave any direct significance, the complete linkage was chosen as the best appropriated linkage\n\noption. The similarity matrix was calculated using a coefficient less sensitive to missing data.\n\nIn this case, the distance coefficient of Bray\u2013Curtis was chosen. Similarity was computed as\n\nS=1-D, where D is the Bray-Curtis distance.\n\nMultidimensional scaling (MDS) can be considered to be an alternative to factor\n\nanalysis. In general, the goal of the analysis is to detect meaningful underlying dimensions\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n19\n\nthat allow the researcher to explain observed similarities or dissimilarities (distances) between\n\nthe investigated objects. In factor analysis, the similarities between objects (e.g. variables) are\n\nexpressed in the correlation matrix (or variance/covariance matrix). With MDS, one may\n\nanalyse any kind of similarity or dissimilarity matrix, in addition to correlation. MDS do not\n\nrequire either normality of distribution or linearity between variable. A stress coefficient\n\nindicates the fit of the graphic representation similar to R2 in regression analyses. Each MDS\n\nrepresentation plot here had stress values lower than 0.15. As the cluster analysis, the MDS\n\nwere also carried out considering the state, vessel category, and gear or trip duration as\n\nfactors. Groupings from the cluster analysis were superimposed on the MDS ordination in\n\norder to appraise the adequacy and the mutual consistency of both representations.\n\nAnalyses were based on species frequency data only as information on weight was only\n\navailable for the main species caught.\n\nIn a first step, cluster and MDS plot were based on an averaged data matrix. Matrix 1\n\nwas based on the average of the frequency number by species caught during each trip within\n\neach category states x vessel x gear. For instance, the frequencies of number of each species\n\nwere averaged for the category motorised boat (BOM) that used traps as a gear and operated\n\nin the state of Pernambuco and so on for all combinations between vessel types, gears and\n\nstate. Matrix 2 was based on the average of the frequency number by species caught by boat\n\nwithin each category states x Trip duration x gear. In addition to the above technique, a two-\n\nway Analysis of similarity test (2 way ANOSIM) was used to test the significance of observed\n\ndifferences between groups (Clarke &amp; Warwick, 1994). Differences according to the crossed\n\nfactors \u2018state\u2019, \u2018vessel\u2019 or \u2018trip duration\u2019 (defined a priori) were tested. The gear factor was\n\nnot tested as it was the least relevant for the discrimination of groups as identified through\n\ncluster and MDS analysis (but see results section).\n\nThe null hypothesis - \u2018no state effect allowing for the fact there may be time at sea\n\neffect\u2019 and the opposite hypothesis \u2018no trip duration effect allowing for the fact there may be a\n\nstate effect\u2019 - were tested.\n\nDifferences according to the crossed factors \u2018state\u2019 and \u2018vessel\u2019 were also tested. The\n\nnull hypothesis - \u2018no state effect allowing for the fact there may be vessel effect\u2019 and the\n\nopposite hypothesis \u2018no vessel effect allowing for the fact there may be a state effect\u2019 - were\n\ntested.\n\nThe ANOSIM analysis aimed to test statistically the groups defined with cluster and\n\nMDS analysis. The analysis was, however, based on the original matrix (landings sampled)\n\ninstead of an averaged catch.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n20\n\nII.II.2.3. Study of the fleet dynamics through their catch composition\n\nThe Shannon index of diversity (H\u2019) (Margalef, 1958), which combines information on\n\nspecies richness (number of species) and how individuals are distributed among species\n\n(evenness), was calculated considering the identified clusters from MDS and ANOSIM which\n\nwas thought to be relevant in defining typologies for the reef fisheries in Northeast Brazil.\n\nThe similarity of percentage analysis (SIMPER) (Clarke &amp; Warwick, 1994; Clarke &amp;\n\nGorley, 2001) was used to examine the percentage contribution that each species is\n\nresponsible to the dissimilarity between two groups and thus identifies those species which\n\ndiscriminate between groups. The Indicator species analysis (ISA) (Dufr\u00eane &amp; Legendre,\n\n1997), was also performed to detect and describe the value of those species that characterise\n\ntypologies. This method produces an \u2018Indicator Value\u2019 (IV) for each species within each\n\ngroup. It varies from 0 (non indicator species) to 100 (perfect indication species exclusive of\n\nthe group). The \u2018indicator value\u2019 (IV) of a species for a partition of sites is the largest value of\n\n(IV) observed over all clusters. The significance of the maximum IV of each species was\n\nassessed by a Monte Carlo procedure, the null hypothesis being: \u2018Indicator value is no larger\n\nthan would be expected by chance\u2019 (i.e. that the species has no indicator value). Indicator\n\nvalues superior to 20% were highlighted in order to visualise the \u2018core conservation area\u2019 of\n\nthese species (McGeoch &amp; Chown, 1998).\n\nII.II.2.4. Linking abiotic factors to catch composition\n\nThe relationship between abiotic factors and the catch composition was examined using\n\nBVSTEP procedure (Clarke &amp; Gorley, 2001). As an alternative to the canonical\n\ncorrespondence analysis, Clarke and Ainsworth (1993) proposed a method called BIO-ENV\n\nfor empirically linking environmental variables to biotic matrix. BVSTEP can be compared to\n\nstepwise regression concept, using forward or backward selection (Clarke &amp; Warwick, 1994).\n\nThe routine calculates a measure of agreement between two (dis)similarity matrices. This was\n\ndone by rank correlating the matching element with Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient ?.\n\nGiven the exponential escalation in the number of combinations of abiotic variables that BIO-\n\nENV has to search through, a stepwise search through the possibilities was undertaken with\n\nthe BVSTEP routine. The abiotic dissimilarity matrix included the following abiotic\n\nattributes: vessels, gear, depth, number of fishers, moon light (in proportion of light), period\n\nof the year (trimester), and effort as number of fishers per days spent at sea. Normalised\n\nEuclidean distance was used. The Spearman\u2019s rank correlation (?) between the abiotic and\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n21\n\nbiota similarity matrices was tested using a permutation procedure under the null hypothesis\n\nthat there is no relation whatsoever between the two matrices.\n\nII.II.2.5. Role of snappers exploitation in the Northeast Brazil reef fishery\n\nFrom a management point of view, it is relevant to have the best knowledge of the\n\nspecies that really matter in the reef fishery dynamic, such as snappers in the studied area. A\n\ngeneralisation of the BIO-ENV routine called BIO-BIO (the abiotic matrix is replaced by the\n\nbiotic matrix) allowed the determination of the small subset of species whose similarity\n\nmatrix best matches the entire set of species (Clarke &amp; Ainsworth, 1993; Clarke &amp; Warwick,\n\n1994). This analysis aims to find the smallest possible subset of species, which combined,\n\n\u2018explain\u2019 most of the pattern in the full data set. Clarke and Ainsworth (1993) found that the\n\nbest subset would be defined when the similarity matrix obtained from the smallest set of\n\nspecies reached a correlation with the similarity matrix obtain from the full set about ?>0.95,\n\nas it was found that when ? reach this level no distinction could be found between two\n\nordinations (note that ? would be 1 if the full set of species was considered).\n\nWithin the determined subset, each species, particularly the snappers, contribution was\n\nlooked at.\n\nII.III. Results\n\nThe catch composition of the reef fisheries in Northeastern Brazil is composed by 187\n\nspecies distributed among 14 families. However, the Lutjanidae family dominated the catch\n\n(from 1996-2000) when considered the percentage in number of fish (28.7%).\n\nII.III.1. Determination of groups\n\nConsidering the matrix 1 (see methods), the cluster (Fig. II.1) and MDS representation\n\n(Fig. II.2) the state factor followed by the vessel category appeared to be the main factors\n\ndriving the catch composition (species number and number of individuals for every species).\n\nThe cluster analysis separated 10 groups at 40% of similarity (threshold arbitrarily chosen to\n\nget few clusters in numbers and well defined (Romesburg, 1984; Legendre &amp; Legendre,\n\n1998). In a first approach, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Rio Grande do Norte landings presented\n\nspecific catch composition while Bahia and Cear\u00e1 catches could not be clearly separated.\n\nWithin each state cluster, the factor \u2018vessel\u2019 segregated better the averaged landings than the\n\ngear factor. The two way ANOSIM test corroborated these results. The global test indicated\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n22\n\nthat there is a difference between groups (state effect combined to the vessel effect)\n\n(p>0.001). Also, in the overall the pairewise test showed significant differences in the catch\n\ncomposition between states allowing for the fact that there is a \u2018vessel\u2019 effect as well as\n\nbetween vessel taking into account the state effect (Table II.4).\n\nPE-BOM-Line\n\nPE-BOM-Net\nPE-BOM-Trap\nCE-PQT-Line\nCE-PQT-Net\n\nCE-JAN-Trap\nCE-JAN-Net\nCE-JAN-Line\n\nPE-PQT-Line\nPE-PQT-Net\nPE-JAN-Line\n\nPE-JAN-Net\nRN-JAN-Net\nRN-JAN-Line\nRN-BOT-Net\n\nRN-BOM-Line\nRN-BOM-Net\nRN-BOT-Line\n\nRN-PQT-Line\nRN-BOV-Line\nRN-BOV-Net\nCE-BOM-Net\n\nBA-BOM-Trap\nAL-BOM-Trap\nAL-BOM-Net\n\nAL-BOM-Line\nCE-BOV-Trap\nCE-BOV-Line\nCE-BOM-Trap\n\nCE-BOV-Net\nBA-BOM-Line\nBA-BOM-Net\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nPE-BOM-Line\n\nPE-BOM-Net\nPE-BOM-Trap\nCE-PQT-Line\nCE-PQT-Net\n\nCE-JAN-Trap\nCE-JAN-Net\nCE-JAN-Line\n\nPE-PQT-Line\nPE-PQT-Net\nPE-JAN-Line\n\nPE-JAN-Net\nRN-JAN-Net\nRN-JAN-Line\nRN-BOT-Net\n\nRN-BOM-Line\nRN-BOM-Net\nRN-BOT-Line\n\nRN-PQT-Line\nRN-BOV-Line\nRN-BOV-Net\nCE-BOM-Net\n\nBA-BOM-Trap\nAL-BOM-Trap\nAL-BOM-Net\n\nAL-BOM-Line\nCE-BOV-Trap\nCE-BOV-Line\nCE-BOM-Trap\n\nCE-BOV-Net\nBA-BOM-Line\nBA-BOM-Net\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nFig. II.1 Dendrogram for hierarchical clustering (using complete linking) of catch groups State-fleet-gear based\non the Bray-Curtis similarity matrix.

Cluster (Fig. II.3) and MDS plot (Fig. II.4)\n\nwere based on averaged landings by states, trip duration and gear type. The factor \u2018state\u2019 and\n\n\u2018trip duration\u2019 appeared as the main elements driving the catch composition. The states of\n\nPernambuco and Cear\u00e1 were split into three groups, Bahia formed one group and Alagoas and\n\nRio Grande do Norte were rather similar. In the overall, the sub-groups were defined\n\naccording to the trip duration category. An ANOSIM test confirmed the differences according\n\nto the crossed factors \u2018state\u2019 and \u2018trip duration\u2019.

The categories\n\ntrips duration \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019 presented similar range of diversity index within state.\n\nH\n'\n(l\no\ng\n2\n)\n\nCE\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nA B C D\n\nRN\n\nA B C D\n\nPE\n\nA B C D\n\nAL\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nA B C D\n\nBA\n\nA B C D\n\nMean+SD\nMean-SD\n\nMean\n\nH\n'\n(l\no\ng\n2\n)\n\nCE\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nA B C D\n\nRN\n\nA B C D\n\nPE\n\nA B C D\n\nAL\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nA B C D\n\nBA\n\nA B C D\n\nMean+SD\nMean-SD\n\nMean\n\nFig. II.5: Diversity (H\u2019) and standard deviation intervals for catch landed by state and trip duration.

Typology of groups\n\nThe reef fishery in Northeast Brazil was characterised, on the overall, by 4 lutjanids\n\nspecies: Lutjanus analis, L. chrysurus, L. synagris, and L. jocu (Table II.6). Coryphaena\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n27\n\nhippurus and Scomberomorus cavalla presented also an important role for the typification of\n\ngroups. Few species were found important in a particular group such as Pseudopeneus\n\nmaculatus with 21% contribution for PEA (state of Pernambuco, trip duration category A)\n\nwhich was typified by one more species, L. synagris (62%). L. synagris also contributed\n\nsensibly for CEA ( State of Cear\u00e1 trip duration A) and for RNA (state of Rio Grande do Norte\n\ntrip duration A). Important contribution were found for L. analis in Pernambuco (trip duration\n\nB, C and D) and in Alagoas (category A) (see Table II.6 for the complete description).\n\nThe indicator species analysis (ISA) differs from species associations analysis in that it\n\ndetermines which species are indicative to a particular group. Good indicator species will be\n\nfound mostly in a single group of a typology and be present at most sites belonging to that\n\ngroup. Indicator species that were significant at p<0.01 were shown with * mark on the Table\n\nII.7. Largest indicator values (IV>20%, in bold in Table II.7) were found in the Cear\u00e1 (A, B\n\nand D trip duration categories), Pernambuco (A) and Bahia (B). Few species characterised the\n\nfishing area as Opisthonema oglinum for CEA, Holocentrotus adscensionis, Haemulon\n\nmelanurum and Malacanthus plumieri for CEB, Lutjanus chrysurus, Rachycentron canadum,\n\nAcanthocybium solandri for CED, Pseudopeneus maculates, Lutjanus synagris, Haemulon\n\naurolineatum for PEA and Caranx latus for BAB. Some species presented low but significant\n\nIV as they were \u2018rare\u2019 species but restricted to a sector and therefore not considered to be here\n\nby chance.\n\n\n\n28\n\nT\nab\n\nle\nII\n\n.6\n:P\n\ner\nce\n\nnt\nag\n\ne\noc\n\ncu\nrr\n\nen\nce\n\nof\nfi\n\nsh\nin\n\nea\nch\n\nca\nte\n\ngo\nry\n\n,f\nro\n\nm\nS\n\nIM\nP\n\nE\nR\n\nan\nal\n\nys\nis\n\n.T\nho\n\nse\nsp\n\nec\nie\n\ns,\nw\n\nhi\nch\n\nco\nnt\n\nri\nbu\n\nte\nd\n\n>\n5%\n\nto\nth\n\ne\nB\n\nra\ny-\n\nC\nur\n\nti\ns\n\nsi\nm\n\nil\nar\n\nit\ny\n\nof\nea\n\nch\ngr\n\nou\np\n\nar\ne\n\nsh\now\n\nn.\n(s\n\nee\nT\n\nab\nle\n\nII\n.1\n\nfo\nr\n\nsp\nec\n\nie\ns\n\nco\nde\n\ns)\n\nS\np\n\ne\nc\n\nie\ns\n\nA\nB\n\nC\nD\n\nA\nB\n\nA\nB\n\nC\nD\n\nA\nB\n\nC\nA\n\nB\n\nL\nu\n\nt\na\n\nn\na\n\n5\n.2\n\n1\n9\n\n.3\n7\n\n3\n.7\n\n2\n9\n\n.6\n4\n\n2\n.1\n\n3\n4\n\n.2\n4\n\n0\n.6\n\n1\n2\n\n.8\n2\n\n7\n.5\n\n1\n1\n\n.6\n1\n\n8\n.1\n\nL\nu\n\nt\nc\n\nh\nr\n\n1\n9\n\n.9\n2\n\n6\n.3\n\n4\n2\n\n.8\n1\n\n8\n.1\n\n2\n3\n\n.5\n1\n\n6\n.3\n\n1\n3\n\n.1\n7\n\n.6\n1\n\n0\n.4\n\n3\n3\n\n.8\n1\n\n9\n.3\n\nL\nu\n\nt\ns\n\ny\nn\n\n5\n6\n\n.0\n1\n\n1\n.7\n\n1\n5\n\n.6\n1\n\n1\n.4\n\n4\n7\n\n.6\n6\n\n1\n.3\n\n8\n.5\n\n9\n.0\n\nL\nu\n\nt\njo\n\nc\n7\n\n.2\n1\n\n0\n.0\n\n8\n.7\n\n1\n5\n\n.5\n9\n\n.5\n1\n\n7\n.0\n\n2\n5\n\n.7\n4\n\n0\n.1\n\n2\n1\n\n.9\n3\n\n0\n.9\n\n1\n2\n\n.9\n1\n\n2\n.0\n\nS\nc\n\no\nc\n\na\nv\n\n6\n.4\n\n1\n2\n\n.5\n7\n\n.6\n6\n\n.1\n8\n\n.2\n7\n\n.5\n\nC\no\n\nr\nh\n\nip\n7\n\n.3\n1\n\n0\n.0\n\n1\n1\n\n.3\n2\n\n1\n.1\n\n1\n4\n\n.8\n\nS\ne\n\nr\nd\n\nu\nm\n\n1\n6\n\n.5\n9\n\n.7\n\nC\na\n\nr\nla\n\nt\n8\n\n.0\n1\n\n3\n.8\n\nP\ns\n\ne\nm\n\na\nc\n\n2\n1\n\n.4\n\nM\ny\n\nc\nb\n\no\nn\n\n1\n1\n\n.0\n7\n\n.3\n\nS\nc\n\no\nb\n\nra\n1\n\n7\n.2\n\nO\np\n\ni\no\n\ng\nl\n\n1\n7\n\n.2\n\nC\na\n\nr\nb\n\na\nr\n\n7\n.0\n\n9\n.7\n\nH\na\n\ne\np\n\nlu\n1\n\n3\n.2\n\nC\ne\n\np\nfu\n\nl\n6\n\n.8\n5\n\n.2\n\nH\no\n\nl\na\n\ns\nc\n\n1\n0\n\n.5\n\nL\nu\n\nt\nv\n\niv\n\nC\na\n\nr\nc\n\nry\n8\n\n.0\n\nA\nc\n\na\ns\n\no\nl\n\n7\n.7\n\nR\nh\n\no\na\n\nu\nr\n\nM\na\n\nl\np\n\nlu\n5\n\n.6\n\nB\na\n\nh\nia\n\nR\nio\n\nG\nr\na\n\nn\nd\n\ne\nP\n\ne\nr\nn\n\na\nm\n\nb\nu\n\nc\no\n\nC\ne\n\na\nr\n\u00e0\n\nA\nla\n\ng\no\n\na\ns\n\n\n\n29\n\nT\nab\n\nle\nII\n\n.7\n:\n\nIn\ndi\n\nca\nto\n\nr\nva\n\nlu\nes\n\nIV\n(%\n\nof\npe\n\nrf\nec\n\nt\nin\n\ndi\nca\n\nti\non\n\n).\nC\n\nol\num\n\nn\nhe\n\nad\ner\n\n\u2018M\nax\n\nG\nrp\n\n\u2019\nis\n\nth\ne\n\ngr\nou\n\np\nid\n\nen\nti\n\nfi\ner\n\nfo\nr\n\nth\ne\n\ngr\nou\n\np\nw\n\nit\nh\n\nth\ne\n\nhi\ngh\n\nes\nt\n\nin\ndi\n\nca\nto\n\nr\nva\n\nlu\ne.\n\nS\npe\n\nci\nes\n\nw\nhi\n\nch\npr\n\nes\nen\n\nta\nsi\n\ngn\nif\n\nic\nan\n\ntI\nV\n\nar\ne\n\nm\nar\n\nke\nd\n\nby\n*.\n\nS\np\n\ne\nc\n\nie\ns\n\nM\na\n\nx\nG\n\nrp\nA\n\nB\nC\n\nD\nA\n\nB\nA\n\nB\nC\n\nD\nA\n\nB\nC\n\nA\nB\n\nP\nse\n\nm\na\n\nc\n*\n\nP\nE\n\nA\n3\n\n9\n1\n\nH\no\n\nl\na\n\nsc\n*\n\nC\nE\n\nB\n3\n\n3\n5\n\nH\na\n\ne\nm\n\ne\nl*\n\nC\nE\n\nB\n3\n\n3\n2\n\nO\np\n\ni\no\n\ng\nl*\n\nC\nE\n\nA\n3\n\n1\n3\n\nC\na\n\nr\nla\n\nt*\nB\n\nA\nB\n\n2\n6\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n8\n\n2\n8\n\nL\nu\n\nt\nc\n\nh\nr*\n\nC\nE\n\nD\n4\n\n5\n2\n\n6\n1\n\n3\n4\n\n3\n1\n\n8\n1\n\n2\nM\n\na\nl\n\np\nlu\n\n*\nC\n\nE\nB\n\n2\n6\n\n5\n2\n\nA\nc\n\na\nso\n\nl*\nC\n\nE\nD\n\n1\n2\n\n5\n1\n\n6\n3\n\n2\n1\n\n1\nL\n\nu\nt\n\nsy\nn\n\n*\nP\n\nE\nA\n\n1\n2\n\n5\n6\n\n8\n7\n\n2\n3\n\n3\n2\n\n1\nR\n\na\nc\n\nc\na\n\nn\n*\n\nC\nE\n\nD\n1\n\n2\n6\n\n2\n3\n\nH\na\n\ne\na\n\nu\nr*\n\nP\nE\n\nA\n1\n\n2\n0\n\nS\ne\n\nr\nd\n\nu\nm\n\n*\nB\n\nA\nB\n\n3\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n9\n\n2\n1\n\n8\nH\n\na\ne\n\np\nlu\n\n*\nC\n\nE\nB\n\n1\n7\n\n3\n4\n\n5\nT\n\nh\nu\n\no\nb\n\ne\n*\n\nB\nA\n\nB\n6\n\n1\n7\n\nL\nu\n\nt\na\n\nn\na\n\n*\nP\n\nE\nC\n\n1\n1\n\n3\n9\n\n1\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n5\n9\n\n3\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n1\n0\n\nS\nc\n\no\nc\n\na\nv\n\n*\nB\n\nA\nB\n\n1\n4\n\n8\n4\n\n1\n4\n\n2\n3\n\n1\n1\n\n5\nC\n\na\nr\n\nb\na\n\nr*\nP\n\nE\nB\n\n4\n1\n\n5\n2\n\n1\n1\n\nS\nc\n\no\nb\n\nra\n*\n\nC\nE\n\nA\n1\n\n5\n1\n\n3\n5\n\nM\ny\n\nc\nb\n\no\nn\n\n*\nC\n\nE\nC\n\n1\n1\n\n5\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n1\n3\n\n1\n1\n\n3\n1\n\nC\ne\n\np\nfu\n\nl*\nC\n\nE\nB\n\n1\n3\n\n3\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n7\n1\n\nC\na\n\nr\nc\n\nry\nB\n\nA\nB\n\n1\n9\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n1\nE\n\nla\nb\n\nip\n*\n\nB\nA\n\nB\n1\n\n5\n1\n\n1\n0\n\nL\nu\n\nt\njo\n\nc\nP\n\nE\nD\n\n4\n7\n\n5\n2\n\n2\n7\n\n9\n2\n\n4\n7\n\n3\n8\n\nT\nh\n\nu\na\n\ntl\n*\n\nB\nA\n\nB\n6\n\n2\n4\n\n9\nC\n\no\nr\n\nh\nip\n\nC\nE\n\nD\n2\n\n2\n8\n\n1\n1\n\n8\n8\n\n7\n6\n\n1\n3\n\nL\nu\n\nt\na\n\np\no\n\n*\nP\n\nE\nB\n\n1\n8\n\n1\n5\n\nB\na\n\nl\nv\n\ne\nt\n\nC\nE\n\nC\n4\n\n7\n5\n\n2\nC\n\na\nl\n\np\ne\n\nn\nC\n\nE\nB\n\n1\n7\n\n3\n1\n\nE\np\n\ni\na\n\nd\ns*\n\nB\nA\n\nA\n7\n\n3\nR\n\nh\no\n\na\nu\n\nr\nB\n\nA\nB\n\n3\n1\n\n5\n6\n\nL\nu\n\nt\nc\n\ny\na\n\nB\nA\n\nB\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n6\nL\n\nu\nt\n\nv\niv\n\nB\nA\n\nB\n1\n\n4\n3\n\n1\n2\n\n4\n1\n\n4\nS\n\np\nh\n\nb\na\n\nr\nC\n\nE\nD\n\n3\n2\n\n4\n2\n\n2\n1\n\n4\nE\n\nu\nt\n\na\nll\n\nC\nE\n\nB\n3\n\n4\n1\n\n2\n1\n\nS\ne\n\nr\nri\n\nv\nB\n\nA\nB\n\n2\n1\n\n2\n4\n\nT\nh\n\nu\na\n\nlb\nB\n\nA\nB\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n4\n\nS\nc\n\no\nre\n\ng\nB\n\nA\nB\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n3\n\nA\nla\n\ng\no\n\na\ns\n\nB\na\n\nh\nia\n\nC\ne\n\na\nr\u00e0\n\nR\nio\n\nG\nra

Each correlation was\n\nfound significantly different from zero, although no strong match of the catch pattern with\n\nabiotic factors were identified. An important part of the catch variation could not be explained\n\nby the abiotic factors used in the analysis. It appears that the depth, on the northern coast\n\n(Cear\u00e1), and trip duration on the southern coast (Bahia, Alagoas) maximised the correlation\n\ncoefficient. The dry season (trimester 1 and 4) as well as the crew size were also important for\n\nthe south states. It should be noted that Bahia presented the lowest correlation coefficient and\n\nthe largest set of abiotic variables required.\n\nTable II.8: Best combination of variables, giving the largest rank correlation ? between biotic and\nabiotic similarity matrices, taken at each state along the Northeast coast.

Determination of the \u2018best\u2019 subset of species that characterised the catch\n\ncomposition\n\nFrom all the species combination possible, it was observed that 13 species were the\n\nmain responsible for the characterisation of the typologies in the reef fishery in Northeast\n\nBrazil (?=0.952). In other words, only 13 species were required to maximise the correlation\n\nbetween biotic and abiotic matrices. The family of Lutjanidae was the most important family\n\nwith 5 species (Lutjanus chrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu, L. vivanus) that showed a\n\nhierarchical structure: the best combination at one level is always a subset of the best\n\ncombination at the next level (Table II.9). Species of the families Carangidae (Carangoides\n\ncrysos, C. latus, Seriola dumerili), Coryphaenidae (Coryphaena hippurus), Haemulidae\n\n(Haemulon plumieri), Scombridae (Scomberomorus cavalla, S. brasiliensis), and Serranidae\n\n(Cephalopholis fulvus) were also relevant (Table II.9).\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n31\n\nTable II.9: Main combinations of the 13 species (variables) determined as the subset that best represents the\ncatch variation.

Discussion\n\nThe study of fishery dynamics and their impacts on the reef fish communities needs to\n\nlook at the multispecific structure within the technological categories in space and its\n\nevolution over time. In the case of exploited marine species, identification of factors\n\n(determination of fishing typology) that influence the dynamic of the fishing activities and the\n\nstructure of this community appears to be necessary, specially in multispecific and multigear\n\ntropical fisheries, by providing a synthetic representation of fishing operations as a necessary\n\nstep in understanding the dynamics of mixed fisheries (Pelletier &amp; Ferraris, 2000).\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n32\n\nIn this study, univariate and multivariate techniques were used, aiming at the\n\nidentification of an integrated picture of the structure of the reef system of Northeast Brazil.\n\nAmongst the factors considered (gear, vessel category, state and trip duration category), the\n\nspatial effect (state as a factor) appeared to be the strongest attribute in separating groups in\n\nNortheast Brazil. The fishery dynamic of each state was found to be influenced by a complex\n\ncombination of technological and environmental factors that drives the landing composition in\n\neach state.\n\nConsidering the technological factors, \u2018trip duration\u2019 best discriminated the catch\n\ncomposition when compared to \u2018fleet category\u2019. Although \u2018trip duration\u2019 categories are\n\nnormally related to the fleet motion (rowing, wind motioned and motor) as motorised boats\n\ngenerally effectuate the longer trips, there are some exceptions reported in the Northeast\n\nBrazilian reef fishery. For example, wind motioned boats may reach as far as the shelf break\n\nfavoured by strong winds in states of Rio Grande do Norte and Cear\u00e1. For this reason, trip\n\nduration was the factor that best determines the distance from the coastline, the variety and\n\nthe uniqueness of the fishing grounds reached and hence the catch composition (more coastal\n\nor deeper water group of species). Although it was expected that the gear factor would\n\nseparate groups of catches, the factor \u2018gear\u2019 appears to be the less representative for\n\ndiscriminating the catch landed. The reason for this may be that the Northeastern Brazilian\n\nfishery is typically multigear and multispecies fishery. For most fleet categories, boats may\n\ncarry, during a single trip, more than one type of gear.\n\nThe complexity of the significant factors appears to be the main feature (influencing the\n\ncatch composition) and is related to the fishing grounds, i.e. the distance from the shore, the\n\nfleet depth operation, and also probably their variety and their diversity. Pelletier and Ferraris\n\n(2000) state that the analysis of the Senegalese artisanal fishery dynamics could be improved\n\nif fishing locations were precisely defined. Same considerations could apply here. The trip\n\nduration was found an important factor influencing the fishery dynamics as it is commonly\n\nrelated to the distance from the shore and that alternative factors as information on depth are\n\nnot always available.\n\nThe maximum of diversity reached at the intermediate \u2018trip duration\u2019 category depend\n\non the habitat availability (Longhurst &amp; Pauly, 1987; Levinton, 2001) and the ecological\n\nrange of the species caught may explain the pattern found (shallow and deep species mixing at\n\nintermediate range, chapter 3).\n\nAlthough in some instance the diversity may be partially influenced by the\n\nbiogeography of reef assemblage (Floeter et al., 2001; Joyeux et al., 2001; Ara\u00fajo &amp; Feitosa,\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n33\n\nin press), it is interesting to note that the state with the wider continental shelf (as Rio Grande\n\ndo Norte) presented lower diversity than the states with narrower continental shelf (as\n\nAlagoas and Bahia). This could be explained by the fact that fishing trips in Rio Grande do\n\nNorte do not occur much in deeper waters. Conversely, fishermen from Bahia can easily reach\n\ndeeper fishing grounds thus resulting in higher index of diversity. The state of Cear\u00e1,\n\nhowever, showed intermediate values of diversity index which could be explained by the fact\n\nthat, although with a wide continental shelf, the state of Cear\u00e1 has external factors as winds\n\nand currents which drives the boat to reach deeper fishing grounds within a shorter period of\n\ntime.\n\nSnappers were the main part of the artisanal catch and contributed most to the similarity\n\nbetween groups. The subset that best defined the catch variability was primarily represented\n\nby snappers as Lutjanus chrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu and, to a lower extend, L.\n\nvivanus.\n\nSeveral criteria may characterise the reef fishery of the Northeastern Brazil as for\n\ninstance life history and ecology of species caught, technical characteristics, geographical\n\ncharacteristics (i.e. geomorphology of the shelf) (see Chapter 1) and local culture. Fishing\n\npatterns observed respond to simultaneous interaction of these attributes. Each vessel has a\n\ncatchability and efficiency, which is specific to its design and to its operation range in relation\n\nto the species caught. Moreover, similar fleet may have a distinct impact consistent with the\n\nfishing area. Changes in the catch composition will incorporate technological effect through\n\nspatial and/or temporal changes.\n\nThe heterogeneity of the northeastern reef fishery described here may have\n\nconsequences on an eventual choice of a model for management issues. Multispecies fishery\n\nmodels may be defined within two main categories, the one which account for biological\n\ninteractions and models of technological interactions. Incorporating biological interaction into\n\nmultispecies models present several difficulties as pointed out by Pikitch (1988). Interactions\n\narising from technical scheme are more realistically identified and can be applied in stock\n\nassessment and management (Brugge &amp; Holden, 1991; Gulland, 1991; Lucena et al., 2002).\n\nTechnical interactions in the reef fishery rely on competing fleet exploiting the same\n\nresources and on the mixed catch resulting from multiple target species (Hilborn &amp; Walters,\n\n1992). Fleets can exploit different stages in the life cycle of the fish stock, in simultaneous or\n\nsequential harvesting and also can involve different geographical areas. Such cases are very\n\ncommon in tropical fisheries that are typically multifleet and multispecies. Because technical-\n\ninteractions models are rather straightforward (by opposition to biological interaction models)\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n34\n\nand are essentially derived from single-species models (Brugge &amp; Holden, 1991), the impacts\n\nof fishing pressure on reef species and ecosystem should be investigated considering such\n\nfactor (see Chapter 5).\n\nManagers should be aware that implementation of a common harvest strategy may not\n\nbe applicable for the entire zone. Every state presented proper dynamics and individual\n\nmanagement policies should be preferred. As discussed by Hilborn and Walters (1992) if one\n\nassumes as a premise that there is a spatially structured system, a grand opportunity could\n\narise in setting up a range of alternative management policies for the various replicates. The\n\nalternative policies can be used in a quicker way (smaller system) and in a safe way,\n\nproviding a buffer against risks of overexploiting some areas. In the case of the Northeast\n\nBrazil, artisanal reef fishery stock assessment modelling and consequently harvest strategies\n\nshould take in consideration that the region is not homogeneous (i.e. different fleet\n\ncomposition, species interactions, geomorphological characteristics). In order to refine such\n\nperception, the spatial effect from survey, in addition to more detailed information about\n\ncommercial fishing activity, should be gathered.\n\nThis analysis also helped to reduce the species complexity to few ones. Within this\n\nsubset, lutjanids appear to be the main group as they represented most of the catch and were\n\nfound to be driving the fishery dynamics. Lutjanids are also very appreciated by the local\n\nmarket and are fish of a high commercial value. Thus, further attention should be paid on the\n\necology and on the impact of fishing on such group. Reef fishery science argues that, due to\n\nthe high complexity of the system, single species assessment may not be adequate. An\n\nalternative may be on the half way between, considering models that take into account data\n\naggregated into major species groups (Ralston &amp; Polovina, 1982). In the present case,\n\nlutjanids should be the group of species used.\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\n35\n\nMain conclusions and thesis outlook\n\nIn this chapter, the overall picture of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil was looked at\n\nbased on univariate and multivariate techniques. These techniques were useful in obtaining an\n\nintegrated picture of the structure of the system. It also helped to characterise the fishing\n\nactivity in the area.\n\nWithin the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, snappers were the main part of the artisanal\n\ncatch and contributed most to the similarity between groups, outstanding the Lutjanus\n\nchrysurus, L. synagris, L. analis, L. jocu and in a lower extend, L. vivanus. Amongst the\n\nfactors considered, the spatial effect (state as a factor) appeared to be the strongest attribute in\n\nisolating groups in Northeast Brazil. The factor \u2018gear\u2019 appears to be the less representative for\n\ndiscriminating the catches, as the Northeastern Brazilian fishery is typically a multigear\n\nfishery. For most fleet categories, boats may carry in a single trip more than one type of gear.\n\nConsidering the technological factors, \u2018trip duration\u2019 best discriminates the catch composition\n\nwhen compared to \u2018fleet category\u2019. However, given some exceptions (mainly related to\n\nfavourable strong winds), \u2018trip duration\u2019 categories are normally related to the fleet motion as\n\nmotorised boats generally effectuate the longer trips. Fleet categories will be further\n\nconsidered in this study within the stock assessment (Chapter 6), not only because they were\n\nefficient in defining typologies in the Northeast reef fishery but also, for practical reasons,\n\nconsidering future management measures to be suggested for the main species exploited by\n\nthe reef fishery in the region.\n\nIn order to better understand how the fleet dynamic is related to the species dynamic,\n\nthe distribution of snappers (primary group of species driving the fishery) and their\n\nrelationship with the fishery dynamic was studied in Chapter 3. Such information will\n\nconsider the relationship between the species distribution and the dynamics of the fleets (gear\n\nused, fleet category and operating area).\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n36\n\nChapter III. Bathymetric trends of Northeastern Brazilian\n\nsnappers (Pisces, Lutjanidae): Implications for the reef\n\nfishery dynamic\n\nIII.I. Introduction\n\nThe abundance of marine species fluctuates in space and time. Such fluctuations may\n\nbe due to physical (currents, temperature, etc.), or biological processes (as growth and\n\nmortality) as well as behavioural processes (migration, habitat use) (Jennings et al., 2001).\n\nNumerous studies have been conducted on spatial and/or temporal distribution of reef fish\n\ncommunities, as size dependent processes have long been recognised as important for the\n\ncommunity structure and resources (Sale, 1980; Gobert, 1994)\n\nIn the case of reef fishes, it is rather common to observe size distribution according to\n\ndepth (MacPherson &amp; Duarte, 1991; Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992). A common pattern observed\n\nfor species is the increase of the number of large specimens with increasing depth (Roberts,\n\n1996). This pattern has been attributed to two main natural processes: ontogenetic migrations\n\nfrom coastal reefs to the external part of the shelf or depth related growth and mortality rates.\n\nWhile ontogenetic migration may be related to availability of suitable prey for juvenile fish or\n\npredation avoidance (Roberts, 1996), differential growth and mortality may be related to\n\nenvironmental factors. Temperature variation according to the depth gradient leads to\n\nvariation in basal metabolism rates and therefore may alter the growth rate (Longhurst &amp;\n\nPauly, 1987). Determining the natural pattern of distribution is specially important for species\n\nthat are targeted by fisheries, as the effects of fishing in a population may also be extended to\n\npopulation parameters.\n\nFishes are an important component of reef environment as they influence the structure\n\nof the communities through predation, competition, and territoriality processes (Sale, 1980).\n\nThe complexity of the interaction on the reef ecosystem turns the study on fishing effect\n\nrather difficult (Jennings &amp; Polunin, 1995b; Polunin &amp; Roberts, 1996). In Brazil, various\n\nspecies are exploited by fishers mostly using hook and line, gill nets and traps. Reef fisheries,\n\nwhich operate mainly in the northeastern, have an important role in the socio-economic life of\n\nthe region (Ferreira &amp; Maida, 2001). However, very little is known on the fisheries dynamics\n\noperating in this area and their effects on reef fish communities. This chapter focused on five\n\nspecies of Lutjanus, which inhabit coastal to deep demersal waters. The main species caught\n\nby the artisanal fishery in Northeast of Brazil were considered: the mutton snapper L. analis,\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n37\n\nthe yellowtail snapper L. chrysurus, the dog snapper L. jocu, the lane snapper L. synagris and\n\nthe silk snapper L. vivanus. The distribution and relative abundance of these species along a\n\ndepth gradient, across the Northeast Brazil continental shelf and upper slope, were described\n\nand analysed. The effects of the reef fishery on distribution, size of fish and CPUE (catch-\n\nper-unit-of-effort) of snappers considering the relationship between the species distribution\n\nand the dynamics of the fleets (gear used, fleet category and operating area) were also\n\ndiscussed.\n\nIII.II. Material and methods\n\nIII.II.1. Data collection\n\nData were collected from August 1996 to March 2000 (REVIZEE program). Species\n\nwere identified and measured at the landing site. The landings sites were chosen within each\n\nstate according to their contribution in the local artisanal fishery. Sites were localised over\n\nthe five states, Cear\u00e1, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Bahia (see Chapter I,\n\nFig.I.1). In addition, some data were collected from research vessels that operated on the\n\nbanks and oceanic islands (Atol das Rocas and Arquip\u00e9lago de S\u00e3o Pedro e S\u00e3o Paulo) off the\n\nRio Grande do Norte coast.\n\nFishermen were interviewed and information regarding the operation within the fishery\n\nand catch were collected. Within the REVIZEE framework, more than 69 000 records of\n\nfishes supplied by 2400 trips were gathered. For this study, nearly 23 000 fishes, which had\n\ninformation on depth, were considered amongst the 5 species of Lutjanus (Table III.1).\n\nTable III.1: Lutjanids sampled with information on depth by states and research surveys.\n\nSpecies Cear\u00e1\nRio Grande\n\ndo Norte\nPernambuco Alagoas Bahia Research Total\n\nL. analis 392 178 977 103 1320 556 3526\nL. chrysurus 2578 400 1092 93 5618 176 9957\nL. jocu 750 79 394 142 989 167 2521\nL. synagris 2271 534 1770 13 489 59 5136\nL. vivanus 130 252 183 42 1090 22 1719\nTotal 6121 1443 4416 393 9506 980 22859\n\nInformation on specific landings and effort (number of boats) by fleet category were\n\ncollected for the studied period by the program \u2018ESTATPESCA\u2019 held by the Brazilian\n\nEnvironmental Agency for official statistics (IBAMA, Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente\n\ne dos Recursos Naturais Renovaveis). The total number of boats (averaged along the months)\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n38\n\nthat were in activity during the studied period were about 17000 boats. The reef fishery can\n\nbe distributed into five categories of fleets classified as following, from the most rudimental\n\nto the most technically advanced fleet: \u2018Paquete\u2019 (PQT), \u2018Jangada\u2019 (JAN), \u2018Bote a vela\u2019\n\n(BOV), \u2018Bote\u2019 (BOT), \u2018Bote motorizado\u2019 (BOM) (see Table II.3 for details).\n\nIII.II.2. Data analysis\n\nThe relationship between depth and fish size was assessed by correlation and regression\n\nanalyses. The correlation analysis was used to test the statistical significance of the\n\nrelationship for each species. The correlation between depth and size was determined for all\n\nspecies using non-parametric Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient. One of the advantages\n\nof the non-parametric correlation is that the resulting coefficient is not influenced by outliers\n\nthat are often present in biological data. Also, normality in depth and fish size data is not\n\nrequired to perform the analysis. The regression analysis was performed using the Kendall's\n\nrobust line-fit method (1990) described in Sokal and Rohlf (1995). Since slopes from all pairs\n\nof observations required to be computed and stored, the vast amount of calculation needed\n\ndrove us to use only a random sample of paired observations. As for non-parametric\n\ncorrelation, the non-parametric regression does not require normality of data, the slope of the\n\nregression curve is not affected by outliers, and it allows the independent variable being either\n\nof the Model I or Model II type (Model I regression assumes that (1) the independent variable\n\nX is controlled by the observer, (2) there is no observation error, (3) process error are\n\nnormally distributed with a mean=0 and (4) samples along the regression line have a common\n\nvariance which is the variance of the error term, Model II assumes that both variables Y and\n\nX are measured with error, and it gives a regression line lying between the Y on X and the X\n\non Y regressions. The model II regression estimates a slope between two variables that are\n\nmeaningful only when measurement error is the sole cause of statistical error.). Kendall's\n\nrank correlation was used in order to test whether the slope (?) for each species was different\n\nfrom zero.\n\nCatches were analysed by gear, which were arranged amongst the following categories:\n\nline, net and trap. Minimum, maximum and average values of fish size were analysed by gear\n\nin order to describe the gear effects on the life history of the species. For each species,\n\ncatches were also analysed by sampled year and fleet category. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)\n\nwas used as an index of relative abundance. The catch was defined in two different ways: (1)\n\nby using total weight (Kg) caught by species and (2) by using number of individuals caught.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n39\n\nFurthermore, in order to standardise the effort between gears, the time (days) spent at sea for\n\neach trip was chosen as the best estimate. In spite of the roughness of the unit of effort, catch\n\nand effort for each species were positively correlated (Spearman\u2019s correlation r = 0.5, p&lt;\n\n0.001). The CPUE analysis was carried out species specific considering the following depth\n\nstrata: &lt;20m (inner shelf), 20 to 80m (outer shelf), and >80m (slope) (Mabesoone &amp;\n\nCoutinho, 1970). The outer shelf zone was not detailed for size distribution analysis as\n\ninformation on effort was too much scarce. The Kruskall -Wallis non-parametric test was\n\nused to test the differences of the CPUE index between depth strata. We also looked at CPUE\n\nversus depth strata relationship using Spearman\u2019s rank correlation analysis.\n\nIII.III. Results\n\nIII.III.1. Catch composition of Lutjanus species by year, gear, depth and fleet\n\nAll five species showed a positive and significant correlation between the fork length\n\nand the depth (Table III.2).\n\nConsidering all gears pooled together, the fish size caught ranged for snappers from 7.5\n\nto 103 cm FL. Mean fork length by species showed a decreasing trend from 1997 to 1999\n\n(non significant for L. jocu) except for L. chrysurus that showed a significant increasing trend\n\nin the mean size (Fig. III.1).\n\nTable III.2: Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients (r) and slope (?) between depth and fish size.\nNote: *** is p<0.001, n is the number of specimen measured for each species, n1 is the\ntotal number of two point slopes, n2 is the number of slope randomly sampled used to\nestimate ?

Analysing the\n\ncatch composition by species, every gear (note: the term gear is used as a generic term that\n\nrepresents the entire category, e.g. \u2018Net\u2019 represents all nets used in the fishery that encompass\n\nevery selectivity characteristics) affected roughly the entire size range of the snapper\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n40\n\npopulations (Fig. III.2). The fork length of snappers caught by all the three gears significantly\n\nincreased according to depth (ANOVA, F=1296.2, df=2, p<0.001) (Table III.3). The\n\noperating depth range was higher for line but shallower for net and traps (Table III.4a). Paired\n\ngear groups were tested using the Mann-Whitney U procedure. Line depth operation was\n\nsignificantly different from net and trap (p<0.001), where no difference could be\n\ndistinguished between net and traps. Lines, nets and traps caught individuals of similar size\n\nfor all species. Fishers using hook and line operated preferentially along the outer shelf. Net\n\nusers occurred preferentially in the shallow water (inner shelf) and the outer shelf and, traps\n\nwere set up preferentially within the 20-80 m (Table III.4b). Largest specimens of each\n\nspecies were caught at deeper limits of the species range.\n\nWhen analysed by fleet category, on the overall, BOM affected roughly the entire fish\n\nsize range. The PQT fleet always caught smaller individuals, while JAN, BOT, and BOT\n\noscillated within the intermediate size range (Fig. III.3). The PQT and BOV or BOT were\n\nrestricted to, respectively, inner and outer shelf and, outer shelf and slope (Table III.5). The\n\nfleets JAN and BOM fished along the entire depth range (Table III.5). Similar pattern was\n\nobserved for median operating depth and proportion of fleet (Table III.6). As a general\n\npattern, small individuals were exclusive to shallow waters and larger ones to deeper waters;\n\nan intermediate zone presented a mixed sized fishes (Fig. III.4).\n\nF\no\n\nrk\nle\n\nn\ng\n\nth\n(c\n\nm\n)\n\nLut analis\n\n40\n\n48\n\n56\n\n64\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nL. chrysurus\n\n30\n\n36\n\n42\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nL. jocu\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nL. synagris\n\n18\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nL. vivanus\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nMean+SD\nMean-SD\n\nMean\n\nFig. III.1: Mean size (cm FL) \u00b1 standard deviation of each species exploited along the Northeastern coast during\nthe studied period (complete sampled years).\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n41\n\nF\nor\n\nk\nle\n\nng\nth\n\n(c\nm\n\n)\n\nL. analis\n\n32\n\n40\n\n48\n\n56\n\nLine Net Trap\n\nL. chrysurus\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n36\n\n40\n\n44\n\nLine Net Trap\n\nL. jocu\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nLine Net Trap\n\nL. synagris\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n36\n\nLine Net Trap\n\nL. vivanus\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\n42\n\nLine Net Trap\n\nMean+SD\nMean-SD\n\nMean\n\nFig. III.2: Mean size (cm; FL) \u00b1 standard deviation of the five main snapper species caught by the three main\ngear categories (Line, Net and Trap).\n\nTable III.3: Mean fork length (cm) \u00b1SD of the five snappers (L. analis, L. chrysurus, L. jocu, L.\nsynagris, L. vivanus) by gear and depth layer.\n\nDepth (m) Line Net Trap All\n\n<20 23.4 (7.3) 22.1 (6.5) 27.3 (10.1) 23.1 (7.2)\n\n20-80 36.9 (11.9) 35.6 (11.9) 35.5 (14) 36.6 (12)\n\n>80 39.8 (12.3) 37.8 (11.7) 38.2 (13.7) 39.3 (12.3)\n\nTable III.4: (a) Median and quartiles of depth (m) of operation for each gear, and (b) proportion (%) of\ngear used by depth layers.\n\n(a)\n\nGear Quartile 25% Median Quartile 75%\n\nLine 27 43.5 63\n\nNet 12.6 34 52.5\n\nTrap 27 36 44.3 (b)\n\nDepth (m) Line Net Trap All\n\n0-20 25.1 40.3 24.6 28.1\n\n20-80 53.2 45.6 60.0 51.9\n\n>80 21.8 14.1 15.4 19.9\n\nTotal 100 100 100 100\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n42\n\nF\nor\n\nk\nle\n\nng\nth\n\n(c\nm\n\n)\n\nL. analis\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nJAN PQT BOV BOT BOM\nL. chrysurus\n\n16\n\n24\n\n32\n\n40\n\n48\n\nJAN PQT BOV BOT BOM\nL. jocu\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nJAN PQT BOV BOT BOM\n\nL. synagris\n\n18\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\n42\n\n48\n\nJAN PQT BOV BOT BOM\nL. vivanus\n\n20\n\n24\n\n28\n\n32\n\n36\n\n40\n\n44\n\nJAN PQT BOV BOT BOM\n\nMean+SD\nMean-SD\nMean\n\nFig. III.3: Mean and range size (cm FL) of the five main snapper species caught by the five main fleet categories\n\u2018motorised boat\u2019 (BOM), \u2018jangada\u2019 (JAN), \u2018paquete\u2019 (PQT), \u2018mixed powered boat\u2019 (BOT), \u2018sailing\nboat\u2019 (BOV).\n\nTable III.5: Mean fork length (cm) \u00b1SD of the five snappers by fleet category and depth layer.\n\nDepth layer JAN PQT BOV BOT BOM\n\n<20 12.7 (4.28) 13.3 (5.34) 18.1 (0.79)\n\n20-80 41.3 (12.14) 31.2 (8.8) 61.4 (12.44) 63.5 (4.01) 46.3 (12.33)\n\n>80 96.1 (10.24) 111.7 (21.18) 117.3 (16.07) 106.2 (20.97)\n\nTable III.6: (a) Median and quartiles of depth (m) of operation for each fleet category and (b)\nproportion (%) of fleet by depth layers.\n\n(a)\n\nFleet Quartile 25% Median Quartile 75%\n\nBOM 42 52.5 97.5\n\nJAN 31 37.5 48\n\nPQT 10.5 19 20\n\nBOT 93 127.5 127.5\n\nBOV 60 75 108\n\n(b)\n\nDepth (m) JAN PQT BOV BOT BOM All\n<20 13.1 69.5 1.5 9.0\n20-80 82.0 30.5 54.4 12.6 68.5 67.7\n>80 4.9 45.6 87.4 30.0 23.2\nTotal 100 100 100 100 100 100\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n43\n\nFig. III.4: Size distribution (cm) of the five Lutjanus species (FL= fork length) according to the depth in the\nstudied area.\n\nIII.III.2.

L. synagris and L. vivanus were more abundant at the\n\nextremes of the snappers distribution range: shallower and deeper waters respectively.

The relationship between the numerical CPUE (individuals caught per day at sea)\n\nand the depth was negatively correlated for L. synagris, L. jocu, L. chrysurus, and L. analis.\n\nL. vivanus presented a non-significant positive relationship (Table III.8a), while the\n\nrelationship between the depth and the CPUE in kg per day at sea was negative for L.\n\nsynagris, positive for L. analis and L. vivanus, and non significant for L. chrysurus and L.\n\njocu (Table III.8b).\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n44\n\nTable III.7: (a) Mean CPUE (kg/time at sea) by species and depth strata, and (b) Mean CPUE\n(Number of individuals/time at sea) by species and depth strata.\n\n(a)\n\nDepth All L. analis L. chrysurus L. jocu L. synagris L. vivanus\n<20 6.0 1.6 3.5 1.2 6.5 --\n20-80 10.8 2.1 8.5 2.1 5.3 2.8\n>80 6.9 1.2 8.0 1.1 1.7 3.9\n\n(b)\n\nDepth All L. analis L. chrysurus L. jocu L. synagris L. vivanus\n<20 1.7 1.0 0.5 0.3 1.8 --\n20-80 12.6 9.6 4.8 5.2 1.4 1.4\n>80 8.6 4.6 5.1 3.6 0.5 2.2\n\nTable III.8: Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients, probability and sample size (n) of the relationship between\ndepth and CPUE (bold and underlined coefficients are significant at 5%), and (a) numerical CPUE, (b)\nbiomass CPUE.

Sailing boats (BOV) and mixed boats (BOT)\n\nrepresented 5% of the total number of trips with an operation range mostly above 80 m. PQT\n\nrepresented 15% of the total number of trips and operated mainly from the coast up to 20 m\n\ndeep.\n\nThe snappers\u2019 catch composition (Fig. III.5) shows that motorised boats (BOM) was the\n\nmain category that fished on the five studied species as they operated along the entire depth\n\ngradient (Table III.9). However, L. synagris, that inhabits shallower waters, was less affected\n\nby motorised boats but it was the main target of the wind propelled \u2018paquetes\u2019 (PQT) and\n\n\u2018jangadas\u2019 (JAN). Conversely, L. vivanus, which inhabits deeper waters, was targeted almost\n\nexclusively by boats (Bom and BOV). The remaining species were mainly caught by\n\nmotorised boats although \u2018jangadas\u2019 (JAN) had a significant role in the exploitation. As\n\nfishing activity was greater at shallow (<20 m) and intermediate depth (20 to 80 m), where\n\nrudimental fleet and more advanced technologically fleets overlap, fishery in Northeast of\n\nBrazil affects mainly species that inhabits preferably this depth layer (L. analis, L. jocu and L.\n\nchrysurus).\n\n0%\n\n20%\n\n40%\n\n60%\n\n80%\n\n100%\n\nL. analis L. chrysurus L. jocu L. synagris L. vivanus\n\nPQT\n\nJAN\n\nBOV\n\nBOT\n\nBOM\n\nFig. III.5: Proportion of the main fleet categories that exploit the five lutjanids species studied.\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n46\n\nThe \u2018jangadas\u2019 (JAN) fleet category was the most numerous fleet in activity along the\n\nnortheastern coast, from Cear\u00e1 to Alagoas (53% of total operating boats) (Table III.10),\n\nfollowed by the motorised boats category (BOM) with 22.4% of the total fleet. However,\n\nalthough motorised boats were less numerous, their fishing power was greater than\n\n\u2018jangada\u2019s\u2019 ones and, landings of motorised boats (BOM) and \u2018jangadas\u2019 (JAN) equally\n\nrepresented 27% of the Lutjanus catches recorded by the Brazilian official statistics during the\n\nperiod from 1997 to 2001 (ESTATPESCA). Motorised boats (BOM) and sailing boats\n\n(BOV) showed the greater yield considering the biomass, CPUE and the numerical CPUE.\n\nBOM yielded 13.7 and BOV 9.6 kg / days spent at sea whilst JAN yielded 6.1 kg/ days (Table\n\nIII.11a and III.11b).\n\nTrip duration (days spent at sea) was different amongst fleet categories and states (Table\n\nIII.12). While small fleets, \u2018paquete\u2019 (PQT) and \u2018jangada\u2019 (JAN), spent at sea no more than\n\ntwo days, more sophisticated fleets trip duration (BOM, BOV) could reach 12 days at sea.\n\nHowever, differences between states were recorded. \u2018Jangadas\u2019 (JAN) from Cear\u00e1 and Rio\n\nGrande do Norte spent, in average, 2 days at sea whilst, in Pernambuco, trip was restricted to\n\na day. Motorised boats (BOM) time at sea ranged from 1 - 2 days in Bahia to 4 - 5 days in\n\nPernambuco, Alagoas and Rio Grande do Norte.

Discussion\n\nPatterns of the relationship between body size and abundance in natural assemblage\n\nhave been documented for a number of animal taxa (Gaston et al., 1993). Also, in a fishery\n\ncontext, an increase of the number of large specimen with increasing depth is commonly\n\nobserved (see review in Roberts, 1996). Our results indicated that significant body size\n\nversus depth relationship has been observed for each species. Bathymetric distribution\n\naccording to demersal fish size has been already reported (Lukens, 1981; MacPherson &amp;\n\nDuarte, 1991). The relationships, examined in our study, showed a general trend going\n\ntowards a greater size with increasing depth and at the same time towards smaller size in\n\nshallower waters, a result also reported in various studies (Rooker, 1995; Machias et al.,\n\n1998; Rex &amp; Etter, 1998). However, the depth- body size relationship is weaker at\n\nintermediate depths due to a spatial overlap. Indeed, when small individuals are exclusive to\n\nshallow waters and only large ones are caught in deep waters, mixed catch of medium and\n\nlarge fishes is reported at intermediate depths. This movement may be related to feeding and\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n48\n\nreproductive habits (Uiblein, 1991; MacPherson, 1998; St-John, 1999; Grutter, 2000;\n\nCarrasson &amp; Matallanas, 2001).\n\nOliveira (2000) reported that, in the Northeastern Brazilian waters, maximum relative\n\nabundance (CPUE) of teleosts on the external part of the shelf and the slope was observed\n\nwithin the depth strata of 100 \u2013 150 m. In this study, the maximum abundance of four\n\nLutjanus species (L. vivanus did not present a significant pattern) was negatively correlated\n\nwith the increasing depth, when numerical CPUE was considered but the relation changed\n\nwhen biomass CPUE was considered. Individuals were caught in greater number in shallow\n\nwaters but as most of them were small sized fishes, the relationship between CPUE index,\n\nconsidering weight, and depth showed a mixed pattern. Several hypothesis have been offered\n\nto describe this pattern, including differential mortality or growth with depth or migration to\n\ndeeper water with increasing size (Roberts, 1996). Ecological characteristics of shallow and\n\ndeep waters may be responsible for such distribution. Shallow waters feature shelters for\n\nyounger fish, as they, generally, have a higher productivity and are inhabited by small preys\n\nthat are also targeted by young, small sized fish. The maximum length reported for the\n\nLutjanus species (L. analis: 94 cm FL, L. chrysurus: 87 cm FL, L. jocu: 128 cm FL, L.\n\nsynagris: 60 cm FL, L. vivanus: 83 cm FL) (Allen, 1985) is similar to the maximum length\n\nregistered for the Northeast Brazilian catches. For all species, young individuals were also\n\ncaught. Hence, the three main operating fishing gears (traps, lines and gill nets) affect almost\n\nthe entire range of the life history of the Lutjanus species. However, gears caught fishes of\n\nsimilar size for all species. Different category of fleet were discriminated by depth of\n\noperation although no great differences were found in mean size caught.\n\nIn a multispecific perspective, the fleet/gear comes into contact with stocks of different\n\nspecies, and a mixed catch result due to the exploitation of technologically interdependent\n\nspecies (Anderson, 1986). In such a context, the technological interactions is not only related\n\nto the selection of part of the stock but also with the selection of the species caught.\n\nConsidering the species\u2019 distribution and the multispecific nature of the reef fishery in\n\nNortheast Brazil, fleet operation may vary from shallow to deep waters depending, amongst\n\nothers factors (environmental conditions, motorised or wind motioned boats, shelf width,\n\ntrade winds, etc), on the availability of a typical coastal species (as L. synagris) or a typical\n\ndeeper-water species (as L. vivanus). Considering such stratified distribution, fleets with\n\ndifferent operation capacities will affect stocks on different ways.\n\nThese differences may not be necessarily related to gear (a boat in tropical fishery may\n\ncarry more than one gear) but also to the fleet power, which is related to fleet category, and\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n49\n\nalso to the state, due to its environmental characteristics. Fishing grounds, i.e. shallow or\n\ndeep waters, will be reached according to fleet power. Factors as engine power, \u2018size\u2019 of the\n\ncrew, carrying capacity, presence or absence of ice are related to the distance to the shore and\n\nhence, the time at sea. Additionally, environmental conditions such as wind, rain, currents, or\n\nthe continental shelf width may influence the access to shallow or deep fishing grounds.\n\nOur results highlighted that technological interactions will affect the catch composition\n\nand therefore the fishing impact on snappers. All fleets categories mostly operated within the\n\n20-80 m depth zone, what consequently affected mostly L. analis, L. jocu and L. chrysurus.\n\nMotorised boats (BOM) affected mainly L. vivanus because of its deeper waters fleet\n\noperation. \u2018Jangada\u2019 (JAN) and \u2018paquete\u2019 (PQT) had as their main target L. synagris since\n\nthey operate in shallower waters.\n\nAlso, climatic, oceanographic or geographic characteristics as winds, currents or\n\ngeomorphology of the shelf may influence the fleet operation and catch composition. For\n\nexample, wind motioned boats, PQT, JAN, BOV, in Cear\u00e1 had a greater operating range, and\n\ntherefore affect a greater number of species, due to the dominant winds that allow the vessel\n\nto reach deeper waters.\n\nFleets are likely to exploit different stages of the life cycle of a fish community while\n\noperating in different geographical areas, in simultaneous or sequential harvesting (Charles &amp;\n\nReed, 1985). Fisheries of the same fish community are linked through their exploitation. To\n\nmaintain the sustainability of the stock and to guarantee the continuance of the resource, the\n\noptimal fleet mix and catch allocation should be carefully considered (Kulbicki et al., 2000;\n\nLabrosse et al., 2000; Letourneur et al., 2000; Lucena et al., 2002).\n\nThe multifleet and multispecies nature of the northeastern Brazilian fisheries has\n\nvarious consequences in terms of resources management and ecological issues. In the study\n\narea, few marine protected areas (MPA) have been created along the coast as a part of a new\n\nmanagement alternative of reef ecosystems (Ferreira, 2000). Some marine protected areas\n\nhave been set parallel nearby the coast, mainly because of logistical reasons, i.e. zone easily\n\naccessible and that can be watched from the shore. This setting would only preserve part of\n\nthe life cycle of some species, excluding other parts of life cycle and, possibly, other species.\n\nDue to the within and between fish species spatial structure, the MPA design will have\n\nconsequences on its efficiency (Kramer &amp; Chapman, 1999). In small reserves near the shore,\n\nsnappers\u2019 home range will exceed the MPA limits. Considering the reef fishery in Northeast\n\nBrazil, the MPA might be most efficient if set in direction to the off-shore in an attempt to\n\nprotect the entire range of fish distribution and consequently the entire life cycle of the\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\n50\n\nspecies. This could also offer some protection of various kind of habitats used by different\n\nstage of the life-cycle of each species.\n\nAlthough one is aware that a dataset originated from commercial fisheries may only\n\npartially represent the fish community because of gear selectivity and fishing tactics, one may\n\nconsider that variations in the effort and/or gear fishing power represent the actual trend in the\n\nfish distribution (fishers go where the fish is). More attention should be given on\n\ntechnological interactions and multispecies aspects of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil as\n\nstock assessment models for the management of single species fished by one type of gear (or\n\nfleet) may be inadequate to apply to the northeastern Brazilian fisheries and to predict\n\nchanges at the assemblage level (Pikitch, 1988; Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992). The inter- and\n\nintra-specific bathymetric distribution and the multifleet character of the Northeastern\n\nBrazilian reef fishery demonstrate that considering only one category of a fleet will likely bias\n\nour assessment on the real impact of fishing activities.\n\nMain conclusions and thesis outlook\n\nIn this chapter, the bathymetric trends of Northeastern Brazilian snappers were\n\ndescribed and its relation with the reef fishery dynamic were considered. For all species,\n\nsmall fish are generally found near the coast in shallow waters and the larger fish are found\n\noff-shore in deeper waters. In terms of abundance, mean maximum relative abundance varied,\n\nfor each species, from the shallow water layers with L. synagris to the deep water layers with\n\nL. vivanus. Gears catch fishes of similar size for all species and affect almost the entire range\n\nof their life history. Fleets with different operation capacities will affect stocks on different\n\nways and this is mainly related to the fleet power, which is related to fleet category. All fleets\n\ncategories mostly operated within the 20-80 m depth zone, what consequently affected mostly\n\nL. analis, L. jocu and L. chrysurus. Motorised boats affected mainly L. vivanus because of its\n\ndeeper waters fleet operation. JAN and PQT had as their main target L. synagris since they\n\noperate in shallower waters.\n\nFor the next chapter, the status of the Lutjanus species will be assessed and it will be\n\nevaluated the applicability of traditional methods (as yield per recruit model and length based\n\nmethods). These methods are widely applied for the assessment and management of tropical\n\nfishery. Fishing mortality and stock size are parameters to be estimated for each of the studied\n\nspecies.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n51\n\nChapter IV. Stock Assessment of snappers using traditional\n\napproaches\n\nIV.I. Introduction\n\nThe basic purpose of fish stock assessment is to provide managers advice on the\n\noptimum exploitation of the aquatic living resources to guarantee a sustainable production\n\nover time (Sparre &amp; Venema, 1998). Broadly, fisheries management is concerned with the\n\nutilisation of the fish as a resource for the best benefit to society, i.e. profitability of the\n\nfishing industry and maintaining the livelihoods of the fishermen (Pascoe et al., 1997).\n\nDue to the poor knowledge of the resource dynamics and the often limited range of data\n\navailable, the management of fish stocks in developing countries is often based on fragile\n\nfoundations. The knowledge of the status of fish stocks is poor or even inexistent, and this\n\nlack of suitable information can hamper stock assessment and fisheries management (Reis,\n\n1992).\n\nStock assessment is typically carried out with the finest of information available. This\n\n\u2018best\u2019 information is often identified as representing the most likely values for the parameters\n\nof the population under study (Restrepo et al., 1990). Powerful analytical techniques permit\n\nreconstruction of the population dynamics of exploited fish stocks and provide estimates of\n\nmortality rates and population abundance based on interpretation of commercial catch\n\nstatistical data (Megrey, 1989). One of the first theories concerning the exploitation of fish\n\nstocks come from Baranov (1918). It provided the theoretical basis for Derzhavin (1922) who\n\nwas perhaps the first to conceive the idea of applying data describing the age structure of a\n\npopulation to catch statistics in order to calculate the contribution of each year\u2019s cohort to\n\neach year\u2019s total catch.\n\nFrom time to time, however, new models are being elaborated, or extensions and\n\naugmentations of older methods are being developed. There are several methods based on\n\ncatch-at-age data. According to Hilborn and Walters (1992), these models can be divided in\n\ntwo classes: (a) Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) or cohort analysis which calculates stock\n\nsize based on catches with no underlying statistical assumptions (b) \u2018Statistical catch-at-age\n\nMethods\u2019 which rely on formal statistical models.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n52\n\nVPA (Gulland, 1965; Murphy, 1965) and cohort analysis (Pope, 1972) has been\n\nwidely applied to commercial fish stock assessment. It consists of a \u2018backwards solution\u2019\n\nwhere historical abundance of a cohort are estimated on the basis of subsequent catches.\n\nThe \u2018Statistical catch-at-age Methods\u2019, reviewed by Megrey (1989) \u2018provide more\n\nformal methods for estimating the current abundance of cohorts still being fished. They are an\n\nextremely powerful and elegant synthesis of VPA, catch curves, selection curves, and stock\n\nand recruitment\u2019 (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992). Data requirements vary from only catch by age\n\nand year up to information concerning effort Paloheimo\u2019s (1980), Fournier and Archibald\u2019s\n\n(1982) and Dupont\u2019s (1983) models, total catch by year Fournier and Archibald\u2019s (1982)\n\nmodel and catch estimate error. As for the classical VPA extension, new statistical methods\n\nhave been developed in recent years to improve population estimates.\n\nAlthough age-structured models are considered the best choice for most of fisheries\n\nbiologists, determining age by reading check marks in hard parts of the fish is neither an easy\n\ntask nor a cheap one, specially in tropical fisheries. Jones (1984) first developed an adaptation\n\nof the age cohort analysis to length-based method, the length-cohort analysis. The length-\n\nfrequency analysis was used traditionally to validate of age determination methods. These\n\ntechniques are growing in importance and new approaches have been developed in order to\n\nuse length distributions for stock assessment (Fournier et al., 1990).\n\nLength cohort analysis was developed for species that cannot be aged. It is applied in\n\nthe situation when only length composition data for the total fishery are available for one year\n\n(or the average length composition for a sequence of years). It is assumed that the picture\n\npresented by all length classes caught during one year reflects that of a single cohort during its\n\nentire life (Sparre &amp; Venema, 1998).\n\nThe most suitable assessment method to apply is still a difficult question to answer. The\n\nresearcher needs to carefully consider what data are available, what errors the data might be\n\nsubjected to what fishery-specific events might be relevant to the population dynamics of the\n\nexploited stock. Mathematical models are then selected in order to extract the most of\n\ninformation from data (Megrey, 1989). Also, fisheries biologists are always concerned to the\n\nfact that estimates of management-related quantities obtained from quantitative fisheries\n\nassessment methods are subject of errors of all different sources. These errors are related to\n\nthe poor knowledge of the resource dynamics or to the poor and/or small quantity of the data.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n53\n\nIn this chapter, I analyse the use of traditional methods to assess the current status of 5\n\ntarget species (Lutjanus analis, L. chrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris and L. vivanus) caught in\n\nNortheast Brazil. The limitations of each model are also discussed.\n\nIV.II. Material and methods\n\nThe determination of the current status of the stock of five reef fish species regarded as\n\ntarget for the small scale fishery in North-eastern Brazil (L. analis, L. jocu, L. chrysurus, L.\n\nsynagris and L. vivanus) included estimates of the fishery mortality and exploitation rates\n\nusing different methods and the determination of reference points as \u2018Fmax\u2019 frequently used\n\nfor the management of fish stock.\n\nRoutine visits to the landing sites of the commercial fishery were undertaken in 5 states\n\nand interviews with skippers and managers were carried out between 1996 to 2000.\n\nInformation regarding the operation within the fishery and catch were collected in a monthly\n\nbasis. The fork lengths (FL) of commercially landed fish were measured to the nearest\n\ncentimetre (see Chapter 3 for details on the number of individuals sampled by species).\n\nPort samples were obtained and annual sampled numbers-at-length were converted to\n\nannual total catches numbers-at-length using information on landing statistics by year and by\n\nstate taken from the official Brazilian statistics supplied by IBAMA (Instituto Brasileiro do\n\nMeio Ambiente e Recursos Naturais Renovaveis).\n\nThe stocks were evaluated considering the Northeast region as a unit, polling together\n\ninformation referred to Cear\u00e1 (CE), Rio Grande do Norte (RN), Para\u00edba (PB), Pernambuco\n\n(PE), Alagoas (AL), Sergipe (SE) and North Bahia (BA). There was no sampling program for\n\nthe states of Para\u00edba and Sergipe within the scope of the REVIZEE Program as landings for\n\nthese states are not as important as for the others states. However, the total catch of Sergipe\n\nand Para\u00edba was added to the total catch of the Northeast region and the length composition\n\nfor these states was here considered as similar to the composition of the adjacent state.\n\nThe Brazilian Current (BC) and the North Coastal Brazilian Current (NCBC) are the\n\nmain surface currents on the Brazilian continental margin (Stramma, 1991; da Silveira et al.,\n\n1994; Sadovy, 1996). They originate from the South Equatorial Current at about 5\u00b0 to 6\u00b0 S\n\nand flow to the south (BC), and to the north and northwest (NBC). The bifurcation of these\n\ncurrent causes the North-eastern Brazil to be divided into two areas: the northern realm\n\n(States of Cear\u00e1, Rio Grande do Norte, and oceanic banks) and the northeastern part (states of\n\nPara\u00edba, Pernambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe and the northern part of Bahia) (see Chapter 1 -\n\nIntroduction). Considering that the studied species have pelagic eggs and larvae, one would\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n54\n\nthink that the reef fish in Northeastern Brazil might be comprised of, at least, two different\n\nunits of stock. In terms of stock assessment, such statement would imply a separated analysis\n\nconsidering separately the two areas. However, there is no clear evidence that supports this\n\nhypothesis. Preliminary genetic studies could not discriminate different stock along the\n\nNortheastern coast. It is supposed that fish spawned along the North coast of the Northeast\n\nBrazil may mix with fish spawned in the south coast of the region. Therefore stock\n\nassessment was carried out considering one unique stock.\n\nThe catch-at-size models require data on numbers-at-size by year and an assumption\n\nabout natural mortality. The total number-at-size was used as input for the use of the Length\n\ncohorts Analysis (Jones, 1984) and consequently, the predictive model of Thompson and Bell\n\n(1934). The age-based VPA (Gulland, 1965) was also used and the total catch-at-size was\n\nconverted into the total catch-at-age using age-length-keys (ALKs) constructed from the\n\ndirect age reading, separately by species (Rezende et al., 2003).\n\nFor the 5 species either the length-cohort analysis and the VPA was used and the\n\ndetailed method is described below.\n\nThe model of Beverton and Holt (1957) was used to L. vivanus since, for this species,\n\nthere is no estimative of total catch and this approach can be used when only the total number\n\nof individuals sampled is available.\n\nIV.II.1. Growth parameters and natural mortality\n\nIV.II.1.1. Growth parameters\n\nFor four of the five target species considered in the analysis (L. analis, L. jocu, L.\n\nchrysurus, L. synagris), a three set of growth parameters (Table IV.1), obtained according to\n\nthe model of von Bertalanffy (1938), were considered as input for the application of the\n\nlength cohort analysis: growth parameters derived directly by the otoliths readings (Rezende\n\net al., 2003), growth parameters obtained by back-calculated length-at-age (Rezende et al.,\n\n2003) and growth parameters determined empirically according to the method of Jones\n\n(1984). The growth parameters are necessary as input for the length cohort analysis and hence\n\nthe predictive model of Thompson and Bell based on length.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n55\n\nIV.II.1.1.1 Growth parameters based on direct readings of the otoliths\n\nTotal length (FL) in cm, was recorded and the pair of the otoliths sagittae removed.\n\nAnalysis of fish age was based on examination of transverse sections of sagittal otoliths.\n\nAlternate opaque and hyalines zones were counted through stereomicroscopic. Fish were\n\nconsidered to be 1 year-old after the formation of the first zone and a further year was added\n\nfor each subsequent zone (Ferreira et al., 2004a; 2004b; 2004c; 2004d). Such pattern was\n\nvalidated by marginal increment analysis (Rezende &amp; Ferreira, in press). The otoliths were\n\nanalysed: the four species showed and annual pattern however only L. chrysurus showed a\n\nvery strong pattern. These results were supported by several studies already published (see\n\nfor review, Rezende &amp; Ferreira, in press). Further study on direct validation techniques using\n\ntetracycline marking are currently being developed (Rezende &amp; Ferreira, pers. com.).\n\nFor the otoliths direct readings, two different readers assigned ages for the fish, with no\n\nprevious information on the fish length. If two readings agreed then that age was adopted as\n\ndefinitive. The otolith was considered ineligible and discarded if there was no good visibility\n\n(for more details, see Rezende et al., 2003).\n\nIt was derived theoretical growth parameters by fitting the direct lengths-at-age to the\n\nvon Bertalanffy (1938) growth equation:\n\n)exp1( )( 0ttk\nt\n\nLL\n??\n\n?\n?=\n\nwhere Lt is the length at age t, L? is the asymptotic length, k is the growth coefficient\n\nand to is the age when length would theoretically be zero.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n56\n\nTable IV.1: Growth parameters obtained according to three methods: direct reading of the otoliths,\nback-calculated lengths-at-age and growth parameters obtained according to Jones (1990)1\n\nSpecies\n\nMethod\nParameters (L? in cm FL,\nt0 in year, k in year-1)\n\nL max (cm, CF) Number of observations\n\nDirect reading2 L?=77.8 k=0.107 t0=-3.8\n\nBack-calculated\nlength-at-age2 L?=71.2 k=0.11 t0=-4.3\n\nL. jocu\n\nJones L?=105 k=0.35\n\n105 196\n\nDirect reading2 L?=60.6 k=0.16 t0=-0.13\n\nBack-calculated\nlength-at-age2 L?=84.5 k=0.05 t0=-1.8\n\nL. analis\n\nJones L?=85 k=0.48\n\n85 257\n\nDirect reading2 L?=71.9 k=0.04 t0=-6.4\n\nBack-calculated\nlength-at-age2 L?=49.5 k=0.107 t0=-2.5\n\nL. chrysurus\n\nJones L?=90 k=0.096\n\n90 582\n\nDirect reading2 L?=62.3 k=0.038 t0=-6.5\n\nBack-calculated\nlength-at-age2 L?=46.8 k=0.036 t0=-6.5\n\nL. synagris\n\nJones L?=65 k=0.73\n\n65 421\n\nL. vivanus Back-calculated\nlength-at-age2 L?=60 k=0.051 t0=-2.3\n\n75 421\n\n1 Growth parameters compatible to the ones reported in literature for fish species of the\nfamily Lutjanidae (Acosta &amp; Appeldoorn, 1992; Newman &amp; Williams, 1996; Rocha-Olivares,\n1998; Santa Maria &amp; Chavez, 1999; Newman et al., 2000; Burton, 2001; Burton, 2002;\nNewman &amp; Dunk, 2002). 2 (Rezende et al., 2003)\n\nIV.II.1.1.2 Growth parameters based on back-calculated lengths-at-age\n\nBack-calculation lengths-at-age was the second source of data for the determination of\n\nthe growth parameters. This technique is widely used to obtain growth curves, to estimate\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n57\n\nlength-at-age of individuals that are rarely observed, to compare growth differences amongst\n\npopulations or sexes of the same species and even to illustrate gear selectivity (Francis, 1990).\n\nThe purpose of back-calculation is to estimate body lengths from scale or otoliths\n\nmeasurements. The details of the estimation of the back-calculated lengths-at-age are\n\ndescribed in Rezende and Ferreira (2003). For the analysis of Lutjanus vivanus, due to the\n\nlack of juveniles in our samples, it was only used the growth parameters derived from back-\n\ncalculated lengths-at-age.\n\nIt was derived theoretical growth parameters by fitting the back-calculated lengths-at-\n\nage to the von Bertalanffy (1938) growth equation.\n\nIV.II.1.1.3 Growth parameters based on the method of Jones (1984)\n\nAn empirical relationship based on a procedure suggested by Jones (1984) is also\n\napplied for the determination of the growth parameters. It is based on choosing a value of L? \n\nequal or \u2018little greater\u2019 (Jones, 1990) than the maximum individual sampled. Afterwards it is\n\nchosen a value of K \u2018compatible\u2019 to the estimated L?  using the method of Ford and Walford\n\ndescribed below:\n\nk=ln[(L? - Lt)/(L?-Lt+1)]\n\nIn this case, the animal grows from Lt to Lt+1 within one year. This may hamper the\n\nuse of this method since the length interval for Lutjanus species to grow within one year\n\ngreatly varies and, growth parameters obtained based on this approach is questionable.\n\nIV.II.1.2. Natural mortality (M)\n\nMethods for calculating natural mortality are based on empirical relationships between\n\nM and other biological and environmental parameters, but because they are less demanding\n\non specific data, they are unlikely to produce good estimates for a particular stock (Gulland,\n\n1989). In that case, a good knowledge of the life history of the species and of the fisheries in\n\nquestion helps the choice of a suitable estimate, and should be considered of maximum\n\nimportance (Reis, 1992). For Lutjanids species, M reported in literature varies from 0.104 to\n\n0.49 (Newman &amp; Williams, 1996; Newman et al., 2000; Burton, 2001; Newman, 2001;\n\nBurton, 2002; Newman &amp; Dunk, 2002). However, most of the estimates for Lutjanus species\n\nrely up to the value of 0.23.\n\nA number of traditional empirical models estimates the natural mortality (M)\n\nconsidering the water temperature and growth parameters or the age at first maturity (Rikhter\n\n&amp; Evanov, 1976; Pauly, 1980a). Recently Ault et al. (1998) developed a method, which\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n58\n\nallows application of a convenient and consistent method to normalise the annual\n\ninstantaneous natural mortality rate M to life span. This method has been applied for coral\n\nreef fish stocks. Initially it is assumed that St? , the fraction of the initial cohort numbers\n\nsurviving from recruitment tr to the maximum age, can be expressed as:\n\nS (t?) = e \u2013M(t?- tr)\n\nWhere t?  is the maximum age registered.\n\nThen, the authors assume an unexploited equilibrium, by setting the probability of\n\nsurvivorship of recruits to the maximum age to be 5% (i.e. S (t?) = 0.05), and letting tr be\n\nequal to 0. The equation above was rearranged in order to provide and estimate of M as\n\nfollowing:\n\nM=-ln(St?)/t? \n\nIt was also calculated M based on the method described by Rikter &amp; Evanoff (Rikhter &amp;\n\nEvanov, 1976) and Pauly (1980a). Depending on the species and method applied, M varied\n\nfrom 0.1 to 0.3. This range will be used for the sensitivity test, which investigates the effects\n\nof different values of natural mortality on the estimates of stock size and fishery mortality.\n\nIV.II.2. Length at first capture (L50)\n\nThe length at first capture was obtained based on the catch curve. When using a\n\nlinearised catch curve to estimate mortality it is usually necessary to discard the left hand side\n\nof the curve because juvenile fish are not fully exploited. A conceptually simple way to\n\nestimate how many fish are missing at each age is to extrapolate on the straight line from\n\nwhich the total mortality coefficient Z is estimated, in order to find the number of juveniles\n\nthere \u2018 ought to be\u2019. The differences between the \u2018 expected numbers\u00b4of individuals that\n\nought to be and the actual numbers of individuals caught should give the ogive resulting from\n\nthe combined effect of recruitment and mesh selection, and the L50 is obtained (Sparre &amp;\n\nVenema, 1998).\n\nIV.II.3. Stock assessment models\n\nIV.II.3.1. Length-cohort analysis and VPA\n\nThe length cohort analysis and VPA uses commercial catch data to calculate stock sizes\n\nand mortality rates of age based or length-based cohorts. It does not by itself indicate how\n\nmany individuals can be caught to meet a given objective, nor does it predict the future. If\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n59\n\nexplains the past (Jennings et al., 2001). This method uses backwards algorithms, which are,\n\nbased on catches, used for the estimation of the stock size. VPA calculates the size of the\n\nstock based on past catches and the number of individuals alive in each cohort for each past\n\nyear. The relationship is simple and, the number of individuals alive in the beginning of next\n\nyear will be equal to the number of individuals alive of the current year minus the annual\n\ncatches and the rate removed by the natural mortality of the referred year (Sparre &amp; Venema,\n\n1998). The output of such methods is the fishing mortality and the number of individuals\n\nalive for each year for the whole period.\n\nHowever, in a tropical fishery it is often available information concerning the catch-at-\n\nage for a short period (1 year or 2). In this situation, it could be used the VPA with pseudo-\n\ncohort. There is also a method proposed by Jones (1984) (Length Cohort Analysis) which\n\nconverts lengths to age based on the growth parameters of von Bertalanffy (L?, k, t0), in case\n\nof the absence of information on catch-at-age. The methods based on pseudo-cohort is based\n\non the assumption of a constant parameter system, i.e. when we are working with data from\n\none year assuming that these resemble those of a cohort during its entire life, which means\n\nthat recruitment and total mortality (Z = F+M) remains constant every year. It is evident that\n\nthis assumption of constant parameter system is rarely fulfilled in real life. However, \u2018it often\n\nhappens that only by making such assumptions we are able to carry out an analysis of\n\navailable data, and it is better to do a crude analysis than none at all\u2019 (Sparre &amp; Venema,\n\n1998).\n\nHowever, it is also possible to follow the fate of a single age group, or cohort, over\n\nsuccessive time intervals. This is applied in this study as the VPA for real cohorts.\n\nHence, for this study, the current status of the 5 species of Lutjanus is assessed\n\nexploring three possibilities of methods as described in the scenarios below:\n\nScenario 1 The length cohort analysis based on the model proposed by Jones (1984). The\n\ninput data necessary for the application of the model are: the total caught number-\n\nat-size, terminal E (F/Z) (determined interactively), an assumption of Natural\n\nMortality M and three set of growth parameters (L?, k, t0). The set of growth\n\nparameters used as input were based on three scenarios: Scenario 1a - growth\n\nparameters based on direct readings of the otoliths; Scenario 1b - growth\n\nparameters based on back-calculated lengths-at-age and Scenario 1c - growth\n\nparameter based on the method proposed by Jones (1984) with L?   based on\n\nmaximum size and compatible k.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n60\n\nScenario 2 Age-based Virtual Population analysis (VPA) (Gulland, 1965) using pseudo\n\ncohorts, assuming equilibrium conditions where nor the effort neither the\n\ncatchability has changed over the whole studied period. The input data for this\n\nmodel is the total caught numbers-at-age (average length composition for 1996-\n\n2000) and an assumption of natural mortality.\n\nScenario 3 Age-based VPA using the real cohorts during the studied period (1996-2000). The\n\ninput data for this model is the total caught numbers-at-age by year and an\n\nassumption of natural mortality.\n\nFor each of the scenarios used for the assessment of the Lutjanus species, it was\n\ninvestigated the effects of different values of natural mortality on the estimates of stock size\n\nand fishery mortality. This sensitivity tests were applied analysing the effect of the different\n\nassumed values of natural mortality (0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and the values obtained based on the method\n\nof Ault et al. (1998)) in the estimates of fishing mortality and stock size. When the results of\n\nthe analysis were considered as not reliable (considering the knowledge of the current status\n\nof exploitation for the species -, fishing mortality should not be much lower than the natural\n\nmortality - see results and Chapter 1), I did not proceed with the sensitivity test.\n\nFor each scenario, the output of the length cohort analysis and VPA were used as input\n\nfor the application of the predictive model of Thompson and Bell which projects yields at\n\ndifferent levels of fishing mortality.\n\nIV.II.3.2. Catch curve\n\nFor L. vivanus it is not available estimates of total landed catches and the value of total\n\nmortality Z was obtained based on the catch curve, which may be used in situations where\n\nonly total sampled catch is obtainable. Graphing the natural logarithms of numbers surviving\n\nover successive years will therefore produce a straight line relationship referred to as a catch\n\ncurve (Beverton &amp; Holt, 1957; Ricker, 1975).\n\nIV.II.4. Predictive models\n\nIV.II.4.1. The predictive model of Thompson and Bell\n\nFuture yields and stock biomass levels can be predicted by means of mathematical\n\nmodels, which are similar to the ones behind VPA and the cohort analysis. The mathematical\n\nformulas for VPA and cohort analysis, that analyse the history of the fishery, can be\n\ntransformed in such way that the knowledge of the past can be used to predict the future\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n61\n\nyields and biomass at different levels of fishing effort (or fishery mortality) (Sparre &amp;\n\nVenema, 1998).\n\nThe main input of this model is the \u2018reference F-at-age\u2019 (or length)-array, an array of F-\n\nvalues per age (or length) group which is obtained from the analysis of historical data, VPA or\n\ncohort analysis. Another input parameters are the number of recruits (also may be obtained\n\nfrom VPA or cohort analysis) and the weight-at-age (or length) array, i.e. the weights of\n\nindividual fish per age (length) group). The output of the model is a succession of predictions\n\nof the catch in numbers, the yield, the mean biomass, all per age (length) group related to the\n\nvalues of F for each group. New values of F can be obtained by multiplying the reference F-\n\narray as a whole by a certain factor usually called X (the so-called Factor X) (Sparre &amp;\n\nVenema, 1998).\n\nIn this study, each set of growth parameters and estimates of natural mortalities\n\ndetermined different scenarios of projection of yield per factor. For each scenario, estimates\n\nof the biological reference points were obtained. It was calculated Fmax (value of fishing\n\nmortality F where the yield is maximum) or Emax (value of exploitation rate E (F/Z) where\n\nthe yield is maximum) and the more conservative biological reference as F0.1 (value of F\n\nwhere the instantaneous rate of variation of the yield is equal to 10% of the maximum rate)\n\n(Gulland &amp; Boerema, 1973; Cadima, 2000). The use of F0.1 as a reference point, although is\n\nregarded as more conservative, has the advantage of being applicable to species for which\n\nthere is no evident maximum in the yield per recruit vs. F curve (Caddy &amp; Mahon, 1995).\n\nThis situation has been noted for some species in this study (see results).\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n62\n\nIV.II.4.2. Relative yield per recruit of Beverton and Holt\n\nTo analyse the current state of the species L. vivanus, the model yield per recruit\n\nproposed by Beverton and Holt (1956; 1957), which do not need the estimates of total catch,\n\nwas used.\n\nThe Beverton and Holt (1956; 1957) model estimates the potential yield of the stock in\n\nfunction of the fishery mortality and the length of first capture, using as input the growth\n\nparameters and an estimate of natural mortality. The fundamental yield-per-recruit model\n\nassumes a steady sate, i.e. that recruitment is constant, and hence the age structure of the\n\npopulation is the same as we would see if we followed a single cohort through time(Jennings\n\net al., 2001). Two outputs may be obtained considering that (1) all fish belonging to a given\n\ncohort recruit to the fishing grounds at the same time: \u2018knife-edge recruitment\u2019 or (2) fish of a\n\ngiven cohort recruit gradually following a smooth function (Sparre &amp; Venema, 1998). The\n\nknife-edge selection should be considered a hypothetical model since it will never describe a\n\nreal situation. Departure from knife-edge selection has a profound impact on yield-per-recruit\n\nestimation and one should use model incorporating realistic selection ogives (Gayanilo Jr. et\n\nal., 1996).\n\nThis model can be regarded as a special application of the Thompson and Bell model,\n\nbeing, however, simpler and requiring less calculation. This model replaces the Thompson\n\nand Bell model in situations where VPA and Cohort analysis cannot be applied. This model\n\nuses as input the growth parameters and an estimate of natural mortality. The biological\n\nreference points Fmax and F0.1 were determined.\n\nA flowchart illustrating the methods applied in this chapter is shown in Fig. IV.1.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n63\n\nTimes series of age frequency data Times series of length frequency data\n\nEstimation of natural\nmortality M\n\nEstimation of growth parameters from\nvon Bertalanffy model\n\nL?, k, t0\n\nSize composition data\n\nTotal landings\n\nSize composition data\n\nSample only\n\nWith age-length key\n\nWithout age-length key\n\nGrowth parameters\n\nL? ,k, t0\n\nLength cohort analysis\n\nJone\u2019s model\n\nFishing mortality F\n\nand\n\nnumber of individuals by length class\n\nCatch curve analysis\n\nTotal mortality Z=F+M\n\nReal cohortsPseudocohorts\n\nFishing mortality F\n\nand\n\nnumber of individuals by age class\n\nVPA using catch-at-age\n\nPredictive model of yield and\nbiomass using age data\n\nThompson and Bell\n\nPredictive model of yield and\nbiomass using length data\n\nThompson and Bell\n\nYield and Biomass\n\nAbsolut MSY, Optimum exploitation\ncoefficient Emax\n\nYield per recruits model\n\nBeverton and Holt model\n\nYield per recruits; Biomasse per recruits\n\nMaximum sustainable Yield\nOptimum Exploitation rate\n\nTimes series of age frequency data Times series of length frequency data\n\nEstimation of natural\nmortality M\n\nEstimation of growth parameters from\nvon Bertalanffy model\n\nL?, k, t0\n\nSize composition data\n\nTotal landings\n\nSize composition data\n\nSample only\n\nWith age-length key\n\nWithout age-length key\n\nGrowth parameters\n\nL? ,k, t0\n\nLength cohort analysis\n\nJone\u2019s model\n\nFishing mortality F\n\nand\n\nnumber of individuals by length class\n\nCatch curve analysis\n\nTotal mortality Z=F+M\n\nReal cohortsPseudocohorts\n\nFishing mortality F\n\nand\n\nnumber of individuals by age class\n\nVPA using catch-at-age\n\nPredictive model of yield and\nbiomass using age data\n\nThompson and Bell\n\nPredictive model of yield and\nbiomass using length data\n\nThompson and Bell\n\nYield and Biomass\n\nAbsolut MSY, Optimum exploitation\ncoefficient Emax\n\nYield per recruits model\n\nBeverton and Holt model\n\nYield per recruits; Biomasse per recruits\n\nMaximum sustainable Yield\nOptimum Exploitation rate\n\nFig. IV.1: Steps of the stock assessment\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n64\n\nIV.III. Results\n\nIV.III.1. Lutjanus analis, mutton snapper\n\nThe length at first capture (L50) for L. analis is equivalent to 36.4 cm FL which is larger\n\nthan the length at first maturity given to the species in Northeast Brazil (28 cm FL) (Ferreira\n\net al., 2004a).\n\nThe estimates of fishery mortality varied for L. analis from 0.008 to 0.909 depending on\n\nthe scenario considered (Table IV.2). The estimates of biomass varied greatly from 1568 to\n\n90.720 tonnes with an exploitation rate (E) varying between 0.037 and 0.901 in function of\n\nthe scenario considered (Table IV.2). Considering the predictive model of Thompson and\n\nBell, it was reported an optimum exploitation rate for a maximum yield (Emax) varying from\n\n0.63 to 0.84 depending on the natural mortality and methods applied (Table IV.2).\n\nAmongst all scenarios tested only scenarios 1c (Length cohort Analysis using as input\n\nthe growth parameters based on the method of Jones (1984)) and 3 (Age-based VPA using\n\nreal cohorts) with values of natural mortality up to 0.2 reached maximum values for the\n\nestimates of the optimum exploitation rate for the maximum yield (Emax) (Fig. IV.2). When\n\nthe yield curve (based on the predictive model of Thompson and Bell) does not reach a\n\nmaximum (curve has an asymptotic format), the value of Emax is not discernible and this\n\nbiological reference point is not reliable for use.\n\nResults of estimates of biomass and exploitation rates (F/Z) for different values of M\n\nwere compared within the scenarios (excluding the scenarios where fishing mortality was\n\nlower than the expected pattern, considering the knowledge of the current exploitation of the\n\nspecies; see Chapter 1 for more explanations of the current exploitation of Lutjanus species).\n\nIn Northeast Brazil, the exploitation of L. analis is reported for the region since 1978 and,\n\ncurrently around 600 tonnes is landed annually. Considering the current level of exploitation\n\nof this species, it is not expected that the fishing mortality F would be greatly lower to M.\n\nMoreover, when F is expected to be relatively small, then the reliability of estimates derived\n\nfrom models relying on catches may be questionable. If M is small compared to F it may not\n\nmatter so much if M is not well estimated (Sparre &amp; Venema, 1998).\n\nFor scenarios 1c and 3 (M = 0.1 and 0.2) (scenarios which the test of sensibility test was\n\napplied, Table IV.2), given all values of M, exploitation rates decrease with an increase in the\n\nassumed natural mortality.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n65\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 F 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3\n\nFactor X\n\nY\nie\n\nld\n(T\n\no\nn\n\nn\ne\n\ns\n)\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\n12000\n\n14000\n\n16000\n\n18000\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 F 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3\n\nFactor X\n\nB\nio\n\nm\na\ns\ns\n\n(T\no\n\nn\nn\n\ne\ns\n)\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 F 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3\n\nFactor X\n\nY\nie\n\nld\n(t\n\no\nn\n\nn\ne\n\ns\n)\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 F 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3\n\nFactor X\n\nB\nio\n\nm\na\n\ns\ns\n\n(T\no\n\nn\nn\n\ne\ns\n\n)\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nFig. IV.2: Yield and biomass obtained by the predictive model of Thompson and Bell in\nfunction of the natural mortality M=0.1, M=0.2, M=0.3 for L. analis.

The maximum exploitation rates (Emax) were respectively\n\n0.86, 0.85, 0.79, 0.89 and 0.63 (Table IV.5). In that case, also the use of F.0.1 (or E0.1) was\n\nrecommended and considering the natural mortality as M = 0.14 (obtained according to the\n\nformulae of Ault et al. (1998), the reference point F0.1 was 0,029, 85% inferior than Fcurrent. If\n\nthis conservative reference point is considered, the species will be considered as\n\noverexploited.\n\nIV.III.5. Lutjanus vivanus, silk snapper\n\nThe yield per recruit model reported a maximum exploitation rate for maximum yield as\n\nE = 0.80 if considered the method of \u2018knife-edge\u2019 and 0.50 if considered the \u00b4 selection ogive\u00b4\n\nmethod (Fig. IV.8). The current exploitation rate obtained for the Northeast Brazil was of\n\nE=0.7 and the stock is regarded as fully exploited.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. IV.8: The yield per recruit model of Beverton and Holt (1956) for L. vivanus.

The assessment of Lutjanus species using traditional approaches\n\nIn this study, many traditional approaches, which have been used for tropical fisheries,\n\nwere tested. However, due to the assumptions of those models (see later section), they are\n\nlimited and results should be taken with caution.\n\nThe extended longevity and low rates of natural mortalities for most of the snappers\n\nindicate that these species are unlikely to sustain high harvest rates of exploitation (Newman\n\n&amp; Dunk, 2002) and, for most species commercially exploited, they are, currently, regarded as\n\nover-exploited. For L. sebae, a long-lived species (longevity of up 35 years), the optimum\n\nfishing mortality was estimated as 0.05-0.0611 and, considering the current exploitation (F =\n\n0.120-0,27), only approximately 6% of the available stock should be harvested in a\n\nsustainable manner (Newman &amp; Dunk, 2002). For the red snapper, L. malabaricus (longevity\n\nof 31 years) of Australia, the biological reference point used, Flimit is 0.0769 which indicates\n\nthat approximately 7% of the available stock can be harvest on an annual basis (Newman &amp;\n\nDunk, 2002). For the mutton snapper L. analis and for the grey snapper L. griseus of Florida,\n\ntotal mortality obtained was 0.49 and 0.34 \u2013 0.95 respectively, but no biological reference\n\nlimit was calculated (Burton, 2001; Burton, 2002). For L. synagris in Puerto Rico, the\n\nBeverton and Holt yield per recruit model indicated that the current fishery harvest\n\napproximately 91% of the potential yield (Acosta &amp; Appeldoorn, 1992). L. peru have been\n\nalso regarded as over-exploited in the coast of Mexico (Santa Maria &amp; Chavez, 1999).\n\nIn this study, according to the stock assessment models applied, all the species under\n\ninvestigation are also regarded as fully or over-exploited depending on the biological\n\nreference limit considered. For some studied species, the concept of the optimum level of\n\nfishing mortality (Fmax) which results in the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is not viable\n\nby the management point of view since there is no clear maximum value in the yield per\n\nrecruit curve for these species. As alternative, some authors have suggested the biological\n\nreference point F0.1 (proposed by Gulland and Boerema (1973). This reference point does not\n\nrequire a maximum value and it is referred as the mortality rate in the point of the yield curve\n\nlocated where the slope is 10% of the maximum slope (Gulland &amp; Boerema, 1973; Caddy &amp;\n\nMahon, 1995; Cadima, 2000). According to Caddy and Mahon (1995) the use of F0.1, although\n\narbitrary, is a management measure based on a bio-economic criteria, as most of the managers\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n77\n\nwould not see an economic return in an increase of the effort (and hence fishing mortality) for\n\nan increase of the yield level inferior to 10%.\n\nFor L. chrysurus and L. synagris, since the yield curve (F x yield) was regarded as\n\nasymptotic and no maximum value was observed. This would mean that effort can be\n\nincreased considerably without any decrease of yield. Obviously this scenario does not\n\nrepresent the reality.. Only the F0.1 can be used as a sensible biological reference point. For\n\nall species, the results considering F0.1 as the biological reference point indicated an imminent\n\nneed for a drastic reduction of the fishing mortality. This reference point is more conservative\n\nthan Fmax, which also illustrated the intensive status of exploitation for Lujanus species in\n\nNortheast Brazil. The low value of the reference limit F0.1 has been found for other Lutjanus\n\nspecies (Newman et al., 2000). However, if considered the life history of the lutjanids, it\n\nseems obvious that these species are very vulnerable, which led, recently, the American\n\nFisheries Society, to recommend that these stock should be exploited with fishing mortalities\n\nsimilar to the natural mortality (Coleman et al., 2000).\n\nIV.IV.2. The limitation of the models applied\n\nIV.IV.2.1. Models based on length based methods\n\nModels based on length frequency distributions are extremely sensitive to the choice of\n\nthe growth parameters. In this study, it could be observed a wide variation of the estimates of\n\nthe fishing mortality by length class, depending on the choice of the growth parameters. The\n\nvariation of the mortality estimates depending on the method applied for the determination of\n\nthe growth parameters has been reported by Newman et al. (2000). Consequently, the\n\nbiological reference points calculated also varied according.\n\nThe length cohort analysis (Jones, 1984) is a simplified approximation of the Virtual\n\nPopulation Analysis (VPA), which uses pseudo-cohorts instead of real cohorts. Jones (1987;\n\n1990) alerts that the length cohort analysis using the growth parameters of Von Bertalanffy\n\nwhich converts length to age based on the inverse equation of Von Bertalanffy results in\n\nvalues of F significantly lower than those obtained by VPA using the catch-at-age and real\n\ncohorts. However, it is possible to apply the model of Jones to a real cohort but this implies in\n\nthe knowledge of the age of individuals (in length based methods the time that a group of fish\n\nthat reach a following length class in not the same for all classes). In this case, the assumption\n\nof steady state disappears and the annual data could be analysed separately allowing the\n\nidentification of the recruitment and mortalities patterns. If annual data is to be analysed\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n78\n\nseparately with the length frequency distribution, fish should be referred by age groups with\n\nfixed intervals, which is often 1 year. For the application of such approach, catches which\n\nlength classes belonging to the same age class are grouped and it is obtained the catch-at-age\n\nmatrix (Cadima, 2000). This approach is called slicing technique. However, it also shows\n\nweakness since the true age of the fish is not known (age is based on the inverse equation of\n\nVon Bertalanffy) and an arbitrary value of t0 is used. The differences between ages \u00b4 dt\u00b4 are\n\nthe values used, eliminating the t0.\n\nAnother alternative suggested by Jones (1984), is to use growth parameters obtained\n\nthrough an \u00b4 empirical\u00b4 procedure based on a L?  slighty superior to the maximum age (Lmax)\n\nand, the growth parameters K is compatible to the calculated L?.  ?he growth parameter K is\n\nobtained according to the method of Ford and Walford (Ford, 1933; Walford, 1946).\n\nHowever, considering that is based on fictitious parameters, the method is subjected to\n\ncriticisms.\n\nEven if the slicing technique or the determination of the growth parameters empirically\n\nmay help the application of the length cohort analysis, it has been shown above the limitations\n\nand restrictions of those methods.\n\nIV.IV.2.2. Virtual Population Analysis using ages\n\nIV.IV.2.2.1 Using pseudo-cohorts\n\nAlthough the cohort analysis by age using pseudo-cohort does not convert length on age\n\nusing the inverse equation of von Bertalanffy (as the method proposed by Jones), this method\n\nmay be also inadequate due to the limitation of the use of steady state over the study period.\n\nThis assumes that rates of recruitment and mortality are constant during the entire life of the\n\nspecies studied. This assumption, however, is rarely fulfilled in real life. Thus, real cohort\n\nVPA should be preferred when time series is available (even short ones).\n\nIV.IV.2.2.2 Real cohorts\n\nVirtual Population Analyses (VPA) was used with real cohorts for the 5 years period.\n\nHowever, the short time series available is possibly a weakness as the studied species are long\n\nlived (from 18 to 29 years respectively for L. chrysurus and L. analis (Rezende &amp; Ferreira, in\n\npress). This may affect the accuracy of the results obtained based on this analysis as a data\n\nseries of 5 years may not comprise of the contrasts needed for the best use of the models. The\n\nconcept \u2018backwards\u2019 of VPA makes the arbitrary choose of the terminal F important for the\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n79\n\nall the estimated F by age-classes. The longer is the temporal series the less important will be\n\nthe weight of the terminal F choice. Also, VPA tends to estimate erroneously the fishing\n\nmortality when the catchability increases while the stock is under decline. In this case, the\n\nassumption that the terminal F did not alter for the last years is a systematic underestimation\n\nof the stock size, which may lead the decision makers to believe that the stock is not declining\n\nas it is (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992). More sophisticated models as catch at age models, which\n\nincludes the estimate of catchability, terminal F and calculation of confidence intervals for\n\nparameter estimates may be used (see Deriso et al., 1985).\n\nConsidering that, the precautionary approach developed at the 1992 United Nations\n\nConference on Environment and Development states that \u2018where there are threats of serious or\n\nirreparable damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for\n\npostponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation\u2019. In such a situation,\n\nfishery managers can either make use of the available information or wait for an improved\n\ninfrastructure, sampling and data collection. The latter option is risky as fish stocks may be\n\ndepleted by the time accurate data become available (Reis, 1992). In that case, considering the\n\ntraditional approaches in stock assessment, VPA has shown to be the most stable model and\n\nthe one, which most represents the current status of the reef fish in Northeast Brazil.\n\nIV.IV.2.3. Consequences of a erroneous choice of M\n\nVarious authors proposed methods for the estimation of M based on empirical formulae,\n\nsome based on doughty hypothesis as the supposition that tropical fishes are less long lived,\n\nfast growing and show higher natural mortality (Pauly, 1980a; Hoening, 1983). The incorrect\n\nuse of the mortality rate has a great impact over the reconstruction of the stock size specially\n\nwhen values of F are relatively near or inferior to the estimates of M. If the estimates of M are\n\nhigher than the real values, the cohort size will be over-estimated and consequently the\n\nestimates of fishing mortality will be under-estimated and vice versa.\n\nIn this study, simulations carried out supported the argument already well described in\n\nthe literature that estimates can be extremely sensitive to the natural mortality used as input.\n\nNewman et al. (2000) also noted this sensitivity and stated that the over-estimation of M\n\nresulted in an underestimate of actual yield-per-recruit for the red snappers L. erythropterus,\n\nL. malabaricus and L. sebae.\n\nIt is well reported that the instantaneous rate of natural mortality varied greatly\n\ndepending on the method considered. For the mutton snapper in the coast of Florida, M varied\n\nfrom 0.28 (Hoenig (1983)formulae) to 0.39 (Pauly, 1980a, formulae) (Burton, 2002). For\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n80\n\nLutjanus malabaricus of Australia, M varied from 0.115 to 0.134 (Newman &amp; Dunk, 2002).\n\nFor L. sebae of north-western Australia, estimates of M also varied form 0.10 to 0.12\n\n(Newman &amp; Dunk, 2002). In this study, the estimates of natural mortality also varied greatly\n\nbut, I consider that the best method is the one which deals with data of the stock itself and that\n\nwas developed for reef fishes, as the method proposed by Ault et al. (1998) that take into\n\naccount the maximum age registered and was applied to Florida reef fishes.\n\nEven when estimates of M are obtained experimentally (which rarely happens with fish\n\nstocks poorly known), an additional assumption is that M is constant. Unfortunately, it is\n\nknown that natural mortality varies according to a complex of ecological variables as\n\npredation, habitat, availability of food, and also according the growth phase and the age of the\n\ncohort.\n\nIV.IV.2.4. Consequences of bias in the age-length keys\n\nVirtual Population Analysis is fundamentally based on historical series of catch-at-age.\n\nHence, bias in the construction of this series will cause systematic effects on the output\n\nestimates and influence all the stock assessment (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992).\n\nThe usual lack of older individuals in samples, which is due to the high fishing\n\nmortality of those age-classes, may have hampered the results of some of the studied species,\n\nmainly L. chrysurus and L. synagris. The absence of older individuals in samples will lead to\n\nan under-estimation of the longevity and hence an over-estimation of M, which will lead to\n\nconsequences for the estimate of Emax. Also, the absence of older individuals greatly\n\ninterferes in the calculation of K and L?, which may results in an inadequate M/K\n\nrelationship, that is used as input for the models (as the Yield per Recruit model of Beverton\n\nand Holt). The problem of the absence of the youngest individuals in samples (they are not\n\nfully recruited to the fishery) can be overcame with the use of back-calculated lengths-at-age,\n\nat least to what refers to the estimates of the growth parameters.\n\nAlthough the problem of the absence of the oldest individuals have been refereed in the\n\nbeginning of data collection for the Program REVIZEE, numerous attempts of selectively\n\ncollect larger individuals was no guarantee of getting older individuals, since from a certain\n\nage, the relationship age-length is not directly correlated to individuals that reach larger sizes\n\nand ceases the growing process. Little is known on how the population is truncated by fishing\n\nand it may be more relevant to take such uncertainty associated to their absence rather than\n\ntrying to find the rare individuals.\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n81\n\nRecent studies have shown that the Lutjanidae are much older than what was long\n\nthought (Wilson &amp; Nieland, 2001; Newman &amp; Dunk, 2002) as it was found for other coral\n\nreef fishes such as Acanthuridae and Scaridae (Choat &amp; Axe, 1996; Choat et al., 1996). These\n\nresults were obtained partly due to the development of refined techniques, but mainly, to the\n\ngreat sample size (more than 3000 individuals samples for both sexes). In the case of the\n\nlutjanids of Northeast Brazil, future studies with larger sampled individuals may verify the\n\nhypothesis of a higher longevity of the studied species.\n\nIV.IV.2.5. Predictive Models yield per recruit model of Beverton and Holt\n\n(1956; 1957)\n\nIn this study, predictive models as Thompson and Bell (1934) and the yield per recruit\n\nBeverton and Holt (1956; 1957) were applied for the species under study. The output is\n\nsimilar for both approaches (Sparre &amp; Venema, 1998).\n\nAmongst others assumptions, the equilibrium condition implies a situation where all\n\nfish alive have been subjected by the same exploitation pattern since they have been recruited.\n\nOther assumptions are also considered: constant recruitment, date of birth uniform for all\n\nindividuals of the same cohort; fishing and natural mortality constant for all cohort since the\n\nfishery recruitment and, a relationship length-weight with the parameter b=3. Although many\n\nof those assumptions are not applicable, this technique allows a quantitative evaluation of the\n\nexploited species when only few data are available (Goevender, 1995).\n\nOne of the inputs needed for the application of the yield per recruit model is the M/K\n\nrelationship. Beverton and Holt (1957) show that for most fish species this relationship varied\n\nfrom 0.8 to 2.2. However, Gulland (1969) noted that this relationship is between 1 and 2 for\n\nsmall pelagics and, between 2 and 3 for demersal fish. It is precisely for these groups of\n\nspecies (small pelagic and demersals) that the model requires major cautions in relation to its\n\napplication and interpretation. Short-lived fish species show high natural mortality rates and\n\nthe yield per recruit curve is flat with maximum values not very discernible (Cergole, 1993).\n\nIn the other hand, fish with slow growth (high M/K rate), show an asymptotic curve and also a\n\nmaximum point is not visibly clear (Megrey, 1989). In this study, demersal fish specially L.\n\nchrysurus and L. synagris showed flat toped curves of yield per recruit\n\nFinally, considered all the methods tested within this chapter, VPA using true cohorts is\n\nthe most appropriated method for the estimation of the exploitation rates of the reef species in\n\nNortheast Brazil, as this method is free of constraining assumptions (equilibrium conditions,\n\nlength converted to age). According to this method, the 5 species of Lutjanus analysed may be\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\n82\n\nregarded as fully or over-exploited, depending on the biological reference point considered\n\n(Fmax or the most conservative F0.1).\n\nMain conclusions and thesis outlook\n\nThis chapter had the objective to describe the current status of L. analis, L. chrysurus, L.\n\njocu, L. synagris and L. vivanus of Northeast Brazil using traditional approaches. A number of\n\nmethods were performed as the yield per recruit model, the method described by Jones, VPA\n\nand the predictive model of Thompson and Bell.\n\nIt was evident that length based models are not suitable for the studied species and may\n\nnot be adequate for many other reef species. Although it may also considered limited, due to\n\nthe short data series, VPA based on age and true cohorts has shown to be the most\n\nappropriate, within the traditional methods applied, for the assessment of the reef fish in\n\nNortheast Brazil.\n\nFor the next chapters, alternatives of evaluating the reef fishes are tested. In chapter 5,\n\nconsidering the multispecies nature of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, the production\n\nmodel will be applied for aggregated yields of individual species. This approach has been\n\nalready used in tropical fishery (Ralston and Polovina, 1982), where the huge diversity of\n\nfishes is often related in fishers\u2019 catches. The technological interaction will be also considered\n\nwithin the biomass model, the Thompson and Bell predictive model and statistical catch-at-\n\nage model. In Chapter 6, using as case study a system in South Pernambuco, we test the\n\nindicator of abundance using fishery independent method as UVC (underwater visual\n\ncensuses) together with catch data.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n83\n\nChapter V. Stock assessment of snappers based on a multispecies\n\nand multi-fleet approach\n\nV.I. Introduction\n\nFisheries biology has often focussed on the biological processes present within\n\nexploited fish stocks. This narrow focus has led to management strategies that ignore the\n\ndynamic response of fishermen to developments in the stock and to management regulations\n\nitself (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992). Fisheries science has recognised that fish species do not\n\nexist in isolation from one another and that they are not harvested independently (Dann, 1987;\n\nMagnusson, 1995; Jennings et al., 2001). The multi-species nature of combined fisheries\n\narises for biological, technical and economic reasons (Magnusson, 1995).\n\nConsidering the interactions within the multi-species nature of fisheries, interactions\n\narising from technical concerns are more realistically identified and can actually be applied\n\nin stock assessment and management Technical interactions arise through the incidental\n\ncatch of non-target species (by-catch) in targeted fisheries or by the exploitation of a target\n\ngroup of species by the same gear and, mainly by the co-existence of fleets exploiting the\n\nsame resource and/or the same fishing grounds.\n\nConsidering the technical interactions which deal with the simultaneous catch of groups\n\nof species, models of the joint capture of species that do not interact biologically (conversely\n\nto trophic interactions i.e. multispecies virtual population analysis, MSVPA) have been\n\ndeveloped by Murawski (1984). Biomass dynamic models for aggregate species group were\n\ndeveloped for jointly caught species (Ralston &amp; Polovina, 1982). Models of this type can be\n\nappropriate for both interacting and non-interacting species (Hollowed et al., 2000). The\n\nadvantage of such approaches is that as there is no specific target species (a group of species\n\ninstead), each species will have a sustainable yield and the total sustainable yield from this\n\nfishery is the sum of those from all species (Anderson, 1986). This combination of yield was\n\ndesignated by Eide and Flaaten (1998) as the maximum sustainable frontier (MSF) and it is\n\nthe long run limit to what can be harvested from all the species. According to these authors\n\n\u2018the harvesting of less than a combination of yields on the MSF does not necessarily secure a\n\nsustainable harvest\u2019.\n\nConsidering the technical interactions arising by the co-existence of fleets exploiting the\n\nsame resource, it is well reported that most tropical fisheries support a large number of gears\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n84\n\nwhose biological impact vary. Models for the management of single species fished by one\n\ntype of gear may be inadequate to apply to most tropical fisheries and to predict changes at\n\nthe assemblage level. These technical interactions caused by different fishing gears exploiting\n\nthe same resource are simple to study and useful results can be obtained (Pikitch, 1988).\n\nSeveral species are caught by the same type of gear and one cannot target effort efficiently on\n\na species by species basis.\n\nIn the Northeast reef fishery, both types of technical interactions are reported. Reef\n\nspecies are caught by different fleets, which exploit the stocks in distinctive ways (Chapters 2\n\nand 3). Effort relying on a specific species may be re-allocated by gear aiming the species\n\nsustainability. The exploitation would hence be gear (or fleet) specific and the effect of the\n\ndifferent gears on the stock structure should be considered. Also, for all gears and fleets that\n\nexploit the reef species in Northeast Brazil, a group rather than individual species is caught by\n\nthe same gear/fleet.\n\nThe ultimate motivation of all fisheries models, whether single- or multispecies, is (1) to\n\ndescribe the fisheries patterns, and (2) to understand and inform decision-makers of the\n\nconsequences of possible fishing activities. In has been reported in the last years a growth in\n\nthe number and type of multispecies models incorporating technical interactions (Pascoe,\n\n2000; Ulrich et al., 2001; Lucena et al., 2002; Ulrich et al., 2002). Within these approaches,\n\nevery kind of gear seems to have some degree of size/age selectivity and unequal catchability\n\nas members of a cohort will have differential vulnerability to the fleet depending on fish size\n\nor other attribute (as bathymetric distribution for example). The multi-fleet exploitation is\n\nconsidered in such approaches. Although these models are in general quite advanced, tropical\n\nfishery models tend to be rather simple. The main limitation is the amount and the quality of\n\ndata (Appeldoorn, 1996). It is recommended a comparison of results obtained by various\n\nmodelling techniques (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992).\n\nThis chapter has the objective of evaluating the exploitation of the snappers fishery in\n\nNortheast Brazil using a multi-fleet and multi-species approach. Also, considering the multi-\n\nspecies nature of the reef fishery, I analyse the different outputs models (considering both\n\ntypes of technical interactions), discussing limitations and advantages of each one. We\n\ncompare the more sophisticated approaches with the traditional techniques familiar to the\n\nfishery biologists.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n85\n\nV.II. Method\n\nThree models with different need of data and perspectives were used: (a) the Thompson\n\nand Bell predictive model (Thompson &amp; Bell, 1934; Sparre &amp; Venema, 1998) including the\n\neffect of different fleets exploiting the same resource, (b) the dynamic biomass model with\n\naggregate species (Ralston &amp; Polovina, 1982), and finally (c) the multi-fleet catch-at-age\n\nmodel (Fournier, 1996). Data was obtained through the Project REVIZEE where fish of 5\n\nLujanus species (L. analis, L. jocu, L. chrysurus, L. synagris and L. vivanus) were measured\n\nin 5 states of the northeast Brazil (see Chapter 2 for more details).\n\nV.II.1. Thompson and Bell\u2019s predictive model\n\nThis model (Thompson &amp; Bell, 1934) was used to predict the effect of changes in the\n\nfishing pattern considering the multi-fleet exploitation of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil\n\n(see Chapter 4). The reef species in the studied area are exploited by 4 different fleets:\n\nmotorised boats (BOM), sailing boats (BOV), \u2018jangadas\u2019 (JAN), \u2018paquetes\u2019 (PQT) (see\n\nChapter 2 for details). The fleet \u2018BOT\u2019 (mixed propulsion boats) are not considered in this\n\nChapter because total catch is not reported in the official statistics (Estatpesca, 2000). Within\n\nthis approach, the total fishing mortality is analysed considering the 4 different types of\n\nexploitation caused by different fleets (based on the proportions of the numbers of fish caught\n\nby each fleet).\n\nThe fishing mortality exerted by one fleet i is:\n\nFi = Ftotal*Ci/Ctotal (5.1)\n\nwhere Ftotal is the total fishing mortality, Ci the catch of the fleet i and Ctotal is the\n\nsummed catch of all fleets.\n\nThus, yields are easily separated into fleet components using the exponential decay\n\nmodel and the catch equation (see Chapter 4 for details Sparre &amp; Venema, 1998):\n\nNt = Nt+1*exp\n-Z (exponential decay) (5.2)\n\nC = N* F/Z *( exp \u2013 Z - 1) (catch equation) (5.3)\n\nWhere t is the year of the analysis, analysis, N is the number of individuals and Z is the\n\ntotal mortality.\n\nSimulation within this approach will be carried out varying or keeping constant the\n\nfactor X for each fleet. This will lead to the assessment of the effect of regulatory measures\n\nfor each fleet component as long as effort is proportional to fishing mortality F.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n86\n\nInitially, the total yield was decomposed by fleet and the same factors, XBOM = XBOV =\n\nXPQT = Xjan are applied to the F-values for each fleet. This corresponds to a situation where\n\nthe fishery mortality for each fleet is always in the same proportion of the total fishing\n\nmortality. Four other scenarios were analysed and corresponded to a change in fishery\n\nmortality for one fleet while the others are assumed to remain at the same level. The scenarios\n\nwere chosen considering that the reef fishery dynamic is driven by the different fleet category\n\nexploiting the resources (see Chapter 2), i.e., fleets which operate mostly in shallower waters\n\n(as \u2018paquete\u2019, \u2018jangada\u2019) exploit mainly the coastal resources whilst boats categories which\n\noperates in deeper waters (sailing boat \u2018BOV\u2019, motorised boat \u2018BOM\u2019) are more related to the\n\nspecies which is mainly distributed in deep waters..\n\nThe scenarios considered are listed below:\n\nScenario 1: Factors XBOM and XBOV are kept constant whereas XPQT and XJAN are allowed to\n\nvary. This scenario explores the situation where fishery mortality is allowed to\n\nvary for \u2018paquetes\u2019 PQT and \u2018jangadas\u2019 JAN fisheries whereas the Boats\n\ncategories fishery mortalities (BOM and BOV) remain constant.\n\nScenario 2: Factors XPQT and XJAN are kept constant whereas XBOM and XBOV are allowed to\n\nvary.\n\nScenario 3: Factors XBOV, XPQT and XJAN are kept constant whereas XBOM is allowed to vary.\n\nScenario 4: (a) Factors XBOV, XBOM and XJAN are kept constant whereas XPQT is allowed to\n\nvary. This applies for L. chrysurus and L. synagris only as L. analis and L. jocu\n\ndid not present significant catch of \u2018paquete\u2019 PQT. (b) Factors XJAN and XBOM are\n\nkept constant whereas XBOV is varied. This applies for L. analis and L. jocu only.\n\nV.II.2. Biomass model\n\nIn some fisheries, the gear comes into contact with stocks of different species, and this\n\ncould often result in mixed catches due to the exploitation of technologically interdependent\n\nspecies (Anderson, 1986). Fish resources in tropical area are mostly multispecies with\n\ncomplex interactions and significant technological interrelationships in the harvesting process\n\nare identified. The less demanding data model to account for the multispecies nature of a\n\nfishery is the surplus production model (requires only data series of catch and effort for each\n\nfishery) also referred as the biomass dynamic models (Jennings et al., 2001).\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n87\n\nAlthough biomass dynamic models (or production models) are commonly considered as\n\n\u2018second-class\u2019 model (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992), they often provide as good estimates of\n\nmanagement parameters as age-structured approaches. Three basic approaches have been\n\nused: (1) the Schaefer model (1954), (2) the Pella &amp; Tomlinson (Pella &amp; Tomlinson, 1969)\n\nmodel, and (3) the difference models (Walters &amp; Hilborn, 1976). The simple Production\n\nModel Schaefer Model adapted by Walters &amp; Hilborn (1976) is derived from the dome-\n\nshaped production model from a function that describes the growth rate of the population\n\naccording to the population size.\n\ndB/dt = g(B) \u2013 Y (5.4)\n\nWhere B is the exploited population biomass at time t, g(B) is the surplus production as\n\na function of biomass, and Y is the yield of the fishery (in biomass). Fishery biologists\n\nusually call this the Schaefer curve (Schaefer, 1954). Schaefer used it to develop a\n\nmathematical basis for fitting surplus production models as the following:\n\ng(b) = rB [1 \u2013 (B/Bmax)] (5.5)\n\nwhere r is the intrinsic rate of population increase and the Bmax is the parameter which\n\ncorresponds to the unfished equilibrium stock size i.e., the carrying capacity (Schaefer,\n\n1954). The methods of fitting these models rely on the assumption that an index of abundance\n\ncan be related to true abundance, as for example the CPUE:\n\nCPUEt = qBt (5.6)\n\nwhere B is the population biomass at time t and q is the catchability coefficient. The\n\ndevelopment of such model requires information on specific catch and effort by gear.\n\nThese parameters are obtained through mathematical program such as \u2018R\u2019 (Ihaka &amp;\n\nGentleman, 1996), which uses an automatic differentiation algorithm to estimate the\n\nparameters of a non-linear function, based on an appropriate likelihood function.\n\nIts is common practice to assume log-normal distributions for the errors because the\n\nrandom processes are usually multiplicative and using a normal distribution could lead to\n\nnegative values of biomass or index of abundance (Hilborn &amp; Mangel, 1997).\n\n??\n\n?\n??\n\n? ??\n=\n\n\u00b22\n))\u00b2ln()(ln(\n\n2\n1\n\n???\n\nestobs\n\nobs\n\nII\ne\n\nI\nL (5.7)\n\nwhere L is the likelihood, I is the index of abundance (here CPUE in weight) observed\n\n(obs) and estimated (est) and ? is the standard deviation of ln(Iobs).\n\nConsidering the multispecies nature of fisheries, the production model can be applied\n\nfor aggregated yields of individual species. This approach is used in tropical fishery, where\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n88\n\nthe large diversity of fishes is often related in fishers\u2019 catches, which may contain 40 or more\n\nspecies of economic importance (Jennings et al., 2001).\n\nIn this study, the equation 5.6 may become an aggregated CPUE (total capture/ total\n\neffort) of the four snapper species studied (Lutjanus analis, L. jocu, L. chrysurus, L. synagris).\n\nL. vivanus is not considered in this chapter because this species is not reported by the official\n\nstatistics.. This method has been already applied by Ralston and Polovina on deep-sea hand-\n\nline fishery in Hawaii (1982) and Koslow et al. reef fisheries of Jamaica and Belize (1994).\n\nV.II.3. Multi-fleet catch-at-age model\n\nIn the proposed model, the exploitation will be fleet specific in order to consider the effect\n\nof the different fleet on the stock structure of each species of Lutjanus analysed. The catch-at-\n\nage model requires data on numbers-at-age and fishing effort by gear and by year and an\n\nassumption about natural mortality.\n\nThe catch-at-age model was implemented in the program \u2018AD Model Builder\u2019 (Fournier,\n\n1996). This program is a tool for the rapid development and implementation of non-linear\n\nstatistical models.\n\nGiven that i indicates the fishing year, j the index age class and f the fleet. Denote\n\ncatchability by gear (qf) and the selectivity coefficients by gear and age (Sg(j)).\n\nThe instantaneous fishing mortality rate by fleet, year and age , Ff(ij), is given by:\n\nFf(ij) = qf Eg(i) Sf(j) exp{?f(i)} (5.8)\n\nwhere Ef(i) is the observed fishing effort by gear in year i and ?f(i) are deviations from\n\nthe expected relationship between the observed fishing effort and the resulting fishing\n\nmortality in year i. Specifically, FPQT(ij), FJAN(ij), FBOV(ij) and FBOM(ij) denote the fishery\n\nmortality by year and age for \u2018paquete\u2019 (PQT), \u2018jangada\u2019 (JAN), \u2018sailing boats\u2019 (BOV) and\n\n\u2018motorised boats\u2019 (BOM) exploitation, respectively. Total fishery mortality is then given by\n\nthe summation\n\nFij = FPQT(ij)+FJAN(ij) +FBOV(ij) +FBOM(ij) (5.9)\n\nThe model considered different fleets for each species. For L. analis and L. jocu,\n\n\u2018jangada\u2019 \u2018sailing boats\u2019 and motorised boats\u2019 were relevant within the exploitation of these\n\nspecies. For L. synagris and L. chrysurus, \u2018paquete\u2019 is also included in the analysis.\n\nFurthermore, it is assumed that the natural mortality rate M is known (see Chapter 4 for the\n\nnatural mortality assumed for each Lutjanus species).\n\nTotal mortality (Z) is given by:\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n89\n\nZ(ij) = F(ij)+M (5.10)\n\nAn iterative estimation approach is used to estimate parameters such as the\n\ncatchability and selectivity. The iterative scheme implemented requires initial estimates of\n\npopulation scale and relative population (denoted relpop) but these are subsequently updated\n\niteratively. For all years, estimates of recruits (at age 1) and numbers-at-age of all ages for the\n\nfirst year of analysis are given by: log (initial population) = log (relpop) + log (population\n\nscale)\n\nN(i,1)= exp{log (initial population(i))} (5.11)\n\nN(1,j)= exp{log (initial population(j))} (5.12)\n\nProviding estimates of the initial population in year 1, N 1,1, N 1,2\u2026, N1,j and the\n\nknowledge of recruitment in each year (N1,1, N2,1,\u2026) the seasonal exponential decay equation\n\nyields:\n\nN (i+1, j+1) = N (i ,j)Sv(i,j) (5.13)\n\nwhere Sv(i,j), the survival by year and age class, is Sv(i,j) = exp\n-Z\n\nThe biomass (B) at the beginning of the year (1st of January) is calculated through the\n\nequation:\n\nBi = ?WjN(ij) (5.14)\n\nWhere Wj is the weight-at-age.

Note that only three log-likelihood (L1, L2 and\n\nL3) were calculated for L. analis and L. jocu as the fleet PQT is not relevant within the\n\nexploitation of these species.\n\nV.III. Results\n\nV.III.1. Thompson and Bell model simulations\n\nV.III.1.1. Lutjanus analis, mutton snapper\n\nMotorised boats (BOM) most influence the yield curve for L. analis as this fleet is\n\nresponsible by the major part of the species capture When fishing mortality for all fleets\n\nsimilarly increase (factors X equals), the stock was found fully exploited by the BOM fishery\n\nwhereas BOV did not reach a maximum and JAN was found already over the maximum yield\n\n(Fig. 1A). This is expected and already described by Sparre and Venema (1998), i.e., the\n\nhigher the effort of the most relevant fleet (in that case BOM) the smaller share is left for the\n\nfleets which are responsible by the lower catches.\n\nConsidering the scenarios, when the \u2018jangada\u2019 (JAN) or the sailing boat (BOV) fishery\n\nincreased and the other remained constant, i.e. scenario 1 (factors XBOM and XBOV are kept\n\nconstant whereas XPQT and XJAN are varied) and 4 (factors XJAN and XBOM are kept constant\n\nwhereas XBOV is varied), the yield does not relevantly change within the range of the X-factor\n\nconsidered (Fig. V.1B). This is mainly related to the fact that the fleets that are allowed to\n\nvary within these scenarios (JAN and PQT) are not relevant within the exploitation of this\n\nspecies (Fig. V.1B). The scenario 2 (factors XPQT and XJAN are kept constant whereas XBOM\n\nand XBOV are varied) has shown a maximum yield at the current fishing mortality (F).\n\nHowever, in the situation of scenario 3 (factors XBOV, XPQT and XJAN are kept constant\n\nwhereas XBOM is varied), the FMAX for BOM is a little beyond the current F (Fig. 1B).\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n91\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFig. V.1: Total yield per 1000 recruits of L. analis separated into fleet component.

(3) changes of effort in BOM, (4)\nchanges of effort in BOV. Red dashed line: BOM, blue dotted line: JAN, dash and circle line: BOV, red\nfull line: total yield. Coloured dots represent the FMAX for each fleet.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n92\n\nV.III.1.2. Lutjanus jocu, dog snapper\n\nThe fishing mortality at maximum yield was 20 % superior to the current F (Fig. 2A). When\n\nthe fishery mortality is considered fleet specific (factors X equals for all fleets), the FMAX for\n\nJAN and BOM were respectively 20% and 40% superior to the current F (X-factor = 1)\n\nwhereas the optimum F for BOV should be reduced by 10% (Fig. V.2A). Effect of changes in\n\nthe \u2018jangadas\u2019 JAN fishery while boat fishery (BOM, BOV) is kept at a constant level\n\n(scenario 1) was relatively low which means that this fleet does not have great influence on\n\nthe yield for this species (Fig. 2B). Considering the scenarios where fishing mortality is\n\nallowed to vary for both \u2018boats\u2019 fisheries (scenario 2), BOM only (scenario 3), and BOV only\n\n(scenario 4), it is evident that only the BOM fishery had a significant impact on the total yield.\n\nOne may note that the dog snapper fishery is already at full exploitation and that efficient\n\nmanagement action should target the BOM fishery.\n\nV.III.1.3. Lutjanus chrysurus, yellowtail snapper\n\nThe total yield did not find a maximum within the range of the factor X varying from 0\n\nto 3 (Fig. 3). As reported in Chapter 4, maximum yield was not very discernible for any\n\nscenario. This is probably related to fish species that show a very low growth rate (see\n\nChapter 4). For this reason, Fmax could be reached when factor X is out of the range\n\nconsidered for this fishery. However, as the yield curve presents an asymptotic shape, the\n\nincrease in factor X from one (current F - X-factor = 1) does not relevantly changes the yield.\n\nThis would mean that, if exploitation reaches more than currently reported (X-factor = 1), the\n\nspecies could be already considered as fully exploited. Considering the scenarios 1 to 4, no\n\nmaximum level of factor-X within the considered range was observed (Fig. 3b). The\n\ncombination of scenarios highlighted the influence of the BOM fleet within the exploitation of\n\nthe species.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n93\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFig. V.2: Total yield per 1000 recruits of L. jocu separated into fleet component.

Lutjanus synagris, lane snapper\n\nEffect of change for each fleet showed that, considering any scenario, that the yield\n\ncurve, as for L. chrysurus is also similar to an asymptotic and no maximum value is easily\n\ndiscernible (Fig. V.4). The Fmax could be reached when factor X is 2.4, but as for L.\n\nchrysurus, given that the yield curve presents an asymptotic shape, the increase in factor X\n\nfrom one (current F - X-factor = 1) does not relevantly changes the yield and this species\n\ncould be already considered as fully exploited. For L. synagris, it is evident that JAN and PQT\n\nplay an important role in the exploitation of this species.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nFig. V.4: Total yield per 1000 recruits of L. synagris separated into fleet component.

Biomass model\n\nA non-equilibrium Schaefer surplus production model was fitted to the data of the four\n\nsnappers (lumped together) reported in the reef fishery of Northern Brazil (L. analis, L.\n\nchrysurus, L. synagris, L. jocu). These species were considered as relevant within the reef\n\nfishery in northeast Brazil (see Chapter 2). The log likelihood was maximised to 4.6 and the\n\nparameters r, q, K, ? and MSY is reported in Table V.1. The observed catch per unit of effort\n\n(CPUE in number) was plotted along to the predicted CPUE and the biomass against the\n\nstudied period (Fig. V.5). The convergence to the best set of parameters, that minimise the\n\nfunction (negative likelihood) was a critical task. The high uncertainty and a goodness-of-fit\n\nsurface with multiple peak interfered to the determination of a satisfactory set of parameter.\n\nBecause of a very short time series for this kind of model and the low contrast of the data\n\n(ideally, alternate periods of low and high abundance of the fish stock is required, according\n\nto Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992), several sets of parameters could maximise the likelihood. For\n\nthis reason, and considering the high uncertainty, further development of the model was not\n\ncontinued.\n\nTable V.1: Estimated parameters with the Schaefer model\n\nParameters Observation uncertainty\n\nK 26314881\n\nr 0.43610568\n\nq 2.92723E-05\n\nMSY 2869017.32\n\nsigma 0.1065865\n\n0.23\n\n0.25\n\n0.27\n\n0.29\n\n0.31\n\n0.33\n\n0.35\n\n0.37\n\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001\n\nC\nP\n\nU\nE\n\n(c\nat\n\nch\npe\n\nrb\noa\n\nts\n)\n\n8000\n\n8500\n\n9000\n\n9500\n\n10000\n\n10500\n\n11000\n\n11500\n\n12000\n\nB\nio\n\nm\nas\n\ns\n(T\n\n)\n\nCPUE\n\nCPUE pred\n\nBiomass\n\nFig. V.5: Observed index of relative abundance (CPUE) and estimated biomass vs. years, with best fit predicted\nCPUE superimposed.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n97\n\nV.III.3.

Total fishing mortality (for the weighted mean F) was\n\n0.05 (Fig 6) and E (exploitation rate; E=F/Z) was equal to 0.30, which means that 30% of the\n\nmortality of this species is due to fisheries.\n\nFor 1996 - 2001, biomass decreased from around 70 to 10 thousand of tonnes over the\n\nperiod (Fig. V.7).

Discussion\n\nAccording to Hilborn and Mangel (1997) four components that ecological scientist needs\n\nto be taken into account are: (i) determination of hypotheses because science consists of\n\nconfronting different descriptions of how the studied system might work (ii) getting \u2018good\u2019\n\ndata, good means informative in the context of a particular view of the system (iii) goodness\n\nof fit which measure how well the description of the system by the model fits the observations\n\n(iiii) numerical procedure that help the investigator to rapidly and efficiently find the best fit\n\n(explore the goodness of fit). In fishery science and particularly in tropical fishery,\n\nmanagement needs to have a good knowledge of the population dynamics of the exploited\n\nfish stock focusing on how the fish stocks have responded to exploitation, and also what may\n\nbe the future response to fishing pressure to this stock. The broad issue of fishing activity\n\nsimultaneously involves the production and the conservation at sustainable levels for futures\n\ncatches, as well as the social considerations that arise specially when various fishers\n\ncategories are involved in the harvest. All fishery models are approximations, and\n\nconsequently many analysts prefer using more than one model to analyse a stock, as does,\n\ne.g., the ICCAT (International Commission for the Conservation of the Atlantic Tuna)\n\n(Prager, 2003). Indeed, each model provides, from its particular perspective, an imperfect\n\nview of the reality (Prager, 2003). Within this chapter, three different models were applied to\n\ndata obtained from the Northern Brazilian fishery in order to get more perception of the\n\ncurrent status of the snappers caught by the reef fishery in Northeast fishery\n\nThe results of Thompson and Bell model suggest that some fleet components already\n\nreached or exceed their optimum fishing mortality level (see Chapter 4). The multi-fleet\n\ncharacteristic of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil is clear when the fishery mortality is\n\nanalysed by fleet. The discrimination by fleet followed the same pattern observed in previous\n\nchapter (Chapter 2): \u2018paquete\u2019 and \u2018jangada\u2019 fleets affected primarily the stock of L. synagris\n\nand in a lesser instance, L. chrysurus whereas \u2018boats\u2019, particularly BOM, were the main fleet\n\nthat exploited L. analis and L. jocu. As a result, scenarios in which Boats remained constant\n\n(scenarios 1, 4) showed a yield almost unchanged. The opposite pattern is observed for\n\nscenario 2 and 3. This would mean that fishery should be mostly controlled for the fleets,\n\nwhich most influence the dynamic of each species (or group of species).\n\nBiomass dynamic models for aggregate species groups can be specified for jointly\n\nharvested species (Ralston &amp; Polovina, 1982). Models of this type can be appropriate both for\n\ninteracting and non-interacting species groups (Hollowed et al., 2000). These models can\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n104\n\nprovide useful guidance in fisheries where there are insufficient resources for time consuming\n\nand costly research vessel surveys and analysis of age structure (Jennings et al., 2001).\n\nBiomass dynamic models have formed the major assessment tools for many fisheries, e.g.\n\nICCAT, IATTC (International American Tropical Tuna Commission), ICSEAF (International\n\nCommission for South East Atlantic Fisheries), amongst others (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992).\n\nHowever, the use of these models depends greatly on the nature of available data. From a\n\ntechnical point of view, data produced according to clear and balanced designs are very\n\nseldom available; the \u2018experimental design\u2019 is given by fishermen working to satisfy their\n\nown needs, not those of the scientists (Pech et al., 2001). Although the surplus production\n\nmodel presented various theoretical advantages (robustness, multispecific approach and\n\npossibility of considering technological interactions), in this study, the output obtained from\n\nsurplus production model was not satisfactory as the Brazilian snapper fishery illustrates\n\nseveral of the common problems faced by the fishery scientist who works on applied\n\nproblems. The data are not determined in controlled experiments and involve untested\n\nassumptions (such as the CPUE is proportional to abundance, the data reported are of high\n\nquality, there is no process uncertainty included), and the time series available is too short.\n\nThe basic assumption in using CPUE data is that changes in CPUE accurately reflect changes\n\nin the abundance of fish in the stock. However, there are many circumstances in which\n\nmeasures of CPUE are poor indices of abundance. In our case rough effort unit (days spent at\n\nsea) and the high variety of gears that present a wide range of catchability (technological\n\ncharacteristics of each gear may vary given are likely to provide low quality estimates). Also,\n\nthe fishing power and spatial effects may result in CPUE being a poor index: the fishing units\n\nin a fleet (i.e. \u2018jangadas\u2019) are unlikely to have equal abilities to catch fish. Furthermore,\n\nconsider a fishing activity in an area. As catches begin to fall, fishers move to other grounds\n\nwhere catch rates may remain high. Even though stocks from the previous area are being\n\ndepleted, CPUE will remain high as fishers move to a previously unexploited part of the stock\n\nin the new area. Conversely, if only part of the stock is fished, CPUEs may fall dramatically\n\neven though overall stock numbers remain high considering the stock\u2019s total distribution. As\n\na result, the answers obtained are not clean or clear. Unfortunately, although these models can\n\nincorporate the multispecies aspects of the fisheries, in Northeast Brazil, the data available\n\nwere not adequate and estimated parameters can not be safely used for predictions of this\n\nfisheries. It should be necessary a longer time series of data for a safer use in the reef fishery\n\nin Northeast Brazil.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n105\n\nThe catch-at-age model showed for most species a high exploitation rate and a decrease of\n\nthe biomass along the studied period, which suggests an overexploitation or at least a fully\n\nexploited state of the snappers in Northeast Brazil (see Chapter 4). This was a pattern\n\nidentical to those found with the Thompson and Bell model. However, the patterns found for\n\nL. jocu by the catch-at-age and Thompson and Bell model were not similar. According to the\n\ncatch-at-age model, current F is equal to 0.05 and this species is then not necessarily over-\n\nexploited where the Thompson and Bell model reported a fully exploited state for this species.\n\nIn that case a precautionary approach should be chosen looking forward to collect further data\n\nfor a more definitive conclusion.\n\nMain fishing effect of \u2018jangada\u2019 and \u2018paquete\u2019 were reported for typical shallower waters\n\nspecies, namely L. synagris and L. chrysurus. The \u2018boats\u2019 (BOM, BOV) mainly affected L.\n\njocu. Within this model was also evident that members of a cohort may have differential\n\nvulnerability to the fleet depending on fish size. For example, young dog snapper L. jocu\n\n(small fish) that live on shallower waters were preferentially affected by \u2018paquetes\u2019 and\n\n\u2018jangadas\u2019. L. chrysurus was exposed to similar fishing mortality for all age classes, whereas\n\nL. synagris had the older specimen more affected. Total fishing mortality obtained with VPA\n\nanalysis was close to the one computed by catch-at-age model. In chapter 4, it was reported F\n\nequivalent to 0.24, 0.27 and 0.19 for L. jocu, L. chrysurus and L. synagris respectively. Also\n\nbiomass values were within similar range for both approaches. However the advantage of the\n\ncatch-at-age model here applied is that it may predict catches considering that the exploitation\n\nis fleet specific and it is evident the effect of the different boats categories on the stock\n\nstructure. Also, the computational program is a powerful in estimating non-linear equations\n\nwhich contains \u00b4 free parameters\u00b4 (as catchability and errors coefficients).\n\nThe interesting point, and somehow reassuring, is that the output of the different models\n\nwas similar from one to another despite the different perspective of each model. Biomass\n\ndynamic and catch-at-age models have different basis of parameter calculation and, if biomass\n\ndynamic methods provide a different answer to the catch-at-age model, then one should try to\n\nunderstand why they are different and analyse the management implication of the different\n\npredictions, rather than concentrating on deciding which method is correct (Hilborn &amp;\n\nWalters, 1992). There are no model that can be qualified the \u2018best\u2019, that is why contrary\n\noutput should be carefully considered as different model\u2019s assumptions may help the scientist\n\nto make the right conclusion. Charles (1998) stated that fishery management framework\n\nvalidity does not imply certitude on the structure of the \u2018real fishery system\u2019. However, they\n\nmust be coherent with available data and their validity relies on their capacity to give some\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n106\n\nanswer to relevant management questions. Despite limitations, applied models satisfactorily\n\nreflected the dynamic of the stocks.\n\nFishing activity partly depends on the state of the resource, which itself partly depends on\n\nthe fishing activity. This means that knowledge is needed on each of those two components\n\nand on their interactions (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992). Such frameworks that attempted to\n\nestimate tropical stocks by fitting model of multifleet multispecies fisheries to data have\n\nalready been proposed: biomass models (Ault et al., 1999; Ould Dedah et al., 1999; Mendoza\n\n&amp; Larez, 2003), age structured model, i.e. ASAP, (RFSAP - Reef Fish Stock Assessment\n\nPanel, 1999), Yield-per-recruit model (Ault et al., 2001; Ault et al., 2002), or others\n\n(McClanahan, 1995; Labrosse et al., 2000; Pech et al., 2001). Focus on multidimensional\n\nfishery appears to be a very important point. Koslow et al. (1988) suggested that the\n\ncomplexity of coral reef fisheries may take them less stable and more vulnerable to\n\noverfishing. When looked at snappers\u2019 stock assessment, the general conclusion that came up\n\nfrom different studies warned that fishing levels were beyond an sustainable levels or at least\n\nbeyond any conservative reference point (RFSAP - Reef Fish Stock Assessment Panel-, 1999;\n\nAult et al., 2001; Ault et al., 2002; Mendoza &amp; Larez, 2003). These findings were not only\n\nreported for the snappers of the Northeast Brazil, but also to others stocks in others regions as\n\nfor example the Florida Keys reef ecosystems (Ault et al., 2001; Ault et al., 2002).\n\nMain conclusions and thesis outlook\n\nThis chapter had the objective to look at the multispecies and multi-gear aspect of the\n\nexploitation of L. analis, L. chrysurus, L. jocu, L. synagris exploring the diverse models,\n\nwhich can incorporate these aspects.\n\nThree models were applied and based on the results of two of the approaches used (the\n\npredictive model of Thompson and Bell and the catch-at-age model), it was evident that\n\ndifferent fleets played distinctive roles on the life history of the snappers in Northeast Brazil.\n\nThe fishery mortality of JAN and PQT is higher for the typical shallower waters species as L.\n\nsynagris. Conversely, L. jocu is most affected by the boats categories (BOM and BOV) which\n\nexploits mainly deeper waters. Within each species, it is also evident the multi-fleet aspects\n\nas, for example, for L. jocu, all stages of its life history is exploited but, distinctively for each\n\nfleet \u2018paquete\u2018 PQT mainly exploits the juveniles and boat exploitation relies on larger\n\nindividuals).With these results some management options could be implemented by acting on\n\ndifferent fishing mortality by fleet through spatial regulation (i. e closed area) as spatial\n\ndistribution of both species and fleet operation played an important role in the Northeastern\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\n107\n\nBrazilian artisanal fishery. These aspects, together with the others findings within this study\n\nwill be discussed in Chapter 7, when contributions to a management plan will be proposed for\n\nthe reef fishery in Northeast Brazil.\n\nFor the next chapter, alternatives of evaluating the reef fishes are considered as it will be\n\ntested the indicator of abundance using fishery independent method as UVC (underwater\n\nvisual censuses) together with catch data using as a study case a system in South Pernambuco.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n108\n\nChapter VI. The Underwater Visual Census Technique \u2013 A direct\n\nestimate of biomass.\n\nVI.I. Introduction\n\nReef fisheries in Brazil is multispecific, multigear and is characterised by multiple\n\nlandings stations as often is the case with most coastal small scale reef fisheries (Samoilys,\n\n1997). Management of such fishery requires a good knowledge of the condition of the stocks,\n\nof the structure of the fish community and of how this structure may be influenced by fishing\n\nactivity (Polunin &amp; Roberts, 1996; Jennings et al., 2001). Reliable estimates of basic\n\nparameters such as abundance, catch and effort are essential to a proper description of stock\n\nconditions.\n\nBoth fishery-dependent and fishery-independent methods of estimating the size of fish\n\nstock have inherent strengths and weakness. One of the central problems in fishery stock\n\nassessment is to obtain an abundance index that is proportional to the stock size and will\n\nreflect trends. Many stock assessment procedures are carried out assuming that CPUE from\n\ncommercial catch and effort data is adequate for this purpose, but CPUE may not be strongly\n\ncorrelated to abundance (Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992). In some cases, the CPUE will remain\n\nhigh until the stock is badly depleted (due to fish aggregation and efficient search) whereas in\n\nother cases it will fall very rapidly while the stock is hardly being affected. In this case,\n\nspecies are distributed between fragmented habitats and are not efficiently exploited due a\n\nsearch deficiency.\n\nUnderwater Visual Census (UVC) techniques can provide rapid estimates of the relative\n\nreef fish abundance, density, biomass and diversity as these non-destructive methods present a\n\ngood alternative way to assess abundance estimates (Harmelin-Vivien et al. 1985). In a\n\nfishery context, visual census estimates are particularly useful because they are independent\n\nof fishing methods that may be affected by the equipment and the gear selectivity. However,\n\nthe UVC methods are restricted to relatively shallow depths due to SCUBA-diving constraints\n\nand to species that are diurnal, visually obvious and not repulsed or attracted by divers. This\n\nbias may be worsened by the acquired behaviour of target species (Kulbicki, 1998). There are\n\nother drawbacks such as sampling bias from diver in estimating erroneously numbers and\n\nsizes of fishes (Harmelin-Vivien et al. 1985).\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n109\n\nIn this study case, visual census techniques were carried out on the Tamandar\u00e9-\n\nMaragogi reef complex. This complex is located between the Pernambuco and Alagoas state.\n\nThe coral reef formations in Tamandar\u00e9-Maragogi represent a good example of the Brazilian\n\ncoastal reefs (Maida &amp; Ferreira, 1997). This area was defined as a \u2018hot-spot\u2019 by the\n\nbiodiversity commission for the coastal zone as it presents a high biological importance and a\n\nintense human activity (Anon, 2002). The area was estimated of extreme biological\n\nimportance considering the rich fauna and flora living in various environment like mangroves,\n\nestuaries, coastal lagoons and coral reefs. However, human activity has great impact on the\n\nlocal environment through chemical and biological wastes from urban and industrial activity,\n\nsugarcane culture, fish or shrimp farming, deforestation and overfishing (see for details Anon,\n\n2002). In the overall, 185 fish species belonging to 129 genera and 64 families were recorded\n\nin protected area \u2018APA dos corais\u2019 (Ferreira et al., 1999; Ferreira &amp; Cava, 2001). From these\n\nspecies 128 were reported by underwater visual census between the shore to the 30m deep\n\n(Ferreira &amp; Cava, 2001).\n\nHere, comparisons of abundance estimates obtained by UVC and by inshore small scale\n\nfishery survey were considered. Information of fish abundance were collected by underwater\n\nvisual census (UVC), which is a fishery-independent method and compared to abundance\n\nindex obtained from fishing activity, catch per unit effort surveys (CPUE). Estimates of fish\n\nabundance and CPUE were used to detect trends or perturbations in stocks. The survey\n\nmethods were compared using multivariate analysis which can offer an interesting insights for\n\nthe analysis of pattern in a multispecific system (Connell et al., 1998).\n\nVI.II. Methods\n\nVI.II.1. Study area\n\nThis study was carried out at two localities Tamandar\u00e9 (Pernambuco) and Maragogi\n\n(Alagoas) that present coastal coral reefs (Fig VI.1) and are part of the Environmental\n\nProtection Area (APA) Costa dos Corais, a multiple use protected area were fishing is\n\nallowed. This conservation unit has a total area of 4135 km2, running along 135 km of\n\ncoastline. Fishing is allowed but restricted to local fishermen (living within the conservation\n\nunit) that have been registered. The sampled area was chosen with the purpose to look at\n\nsnapper community. The Tamandar\u00e9 complex of elongated banks, patch and attached bank\n\nreefs runs parallel to the coast. According to Maida and Ferreira (1997), the reefs are\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n110\n\narranged in three lines. The first line, of few meters wide, next to the beach, consists of\n\nshallow sandstone structure exposed at low tide. Fifty meters away, the second line depth\n\nranged between 1 to 8 m at different distance from the seacoast. They consist in elongated\n\nbanks that delimit a back reef zone where patch reefs (that may exceed 50 m wide) grow\n\nseaward of the attached banks. Their tops may be emerged at low tide. The third line forms a\n\nbarrier like reef that is typical of the complex (Maida &amp; Ferreira, 1997). This barrier is formed\n\nby isolated columns, the tops of which extended laterally and coalesced. Fifty meters away\n\nfrom the coast began the study area comprising the reef formations that occur along the shelf,\n\nalso arranged in fragmented line roughly parallel to the coast. These geomorphological units\n\nwere probably originated by the previous coastline that moved through the geological periods\n\n(Mabesoone &amp; Coutinho, 1970). These drowned reefs may be of various shapes according to\n\ntheir heights, width and surface roughness. The reef formations are called locally \u2018cabe\u00e7os\u2019,\n\n\u2018ta\u00e7is\u2019 and \u2018lages\u2019. \u2018Cabe\u00e7os\u2019 are drowned reef knolls, \u2018Ta\u00e7is\u2019 are irregular platforms and\n\n\u2018Lages\u2019 are even platform of low height. The two latter formations are possibly buried reef\n\nconstructions. Although roughness has not been measured, occurrence of cavities may be\n\ncategorised into the reef types in decreasing order of complexity:\n\n\u2022 knolls (K), pinnacles of 5 to 10 m of diameter that rises up 10 m from the sea\n\nfloor. These structures may occur in clusters and are typically surrounded by\n\nlarge sand plains.\n\n\u2022 irregular platforms (IP): contiguous reef substrate of moderate vertical relief and\n\ncomplexity. Relief consists in caverns/undercuts into the substrate.\n\n\u2022 even platform (EP): contiguous reef characterised by a low structural complexity\n\nwith a low relief hard bottom\n\nThe fishing grounds surveyed range from 9m to 29m deep and are usually frequented by\n\nartisanal fishers using basic fishing techniques such as hand line or harpoon. One site called\n\n\u2018Os Claros\u2019, which is positioned on the limit of a no-take area prohibiting any type of human\n\nactivities (fishing and tourism) was also surveyed. Created in 1999, the no-take area limited at\n\nthe Tamandar\u00e9 Bay is part of the protected area \u2018APA Costa dos Corais\u2019 and is located in\n\nfront of the base of the \u2018Projeto Recifes Costeiros\u2019 (see footnote chapter 1) and covers 2.5\n\nkm\u00b2. The substratum consists of an area of soft sediments and sand scattered with coral and\n\nsandstone. Local fishermen do not make any use of advanced technological instrumentation to\n\ndetect fish or localise fishing ground. Traditionally, positioning is made by visual\n\ntriangulation through terrestrial marks.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n111\n\nFig. VI.1: Study area. Numbered dot are the sampled sites. The dashed area represents the MPA \u2018Costa dos\ncorais\u2019.

All data were collected\nduring this study except at the site (1) where previous data from the \u2018Projeto Recifes Costeiros\u2019 were\nincluded.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n112\n\nVI.II.2. UVC method\n\nTo study the fish community structure, through the definition of patterns in species\n\ncomposition and species abundance, stationary visual censuses were carried out in ten stations\n\nby two divers. The sampling was undertaken during summertime (October 2002 to March\n\n2003, austral summer) which corresponds to the dry season when water visibility, affected by\n\nwind and rain (terrestrial runoff) is best. A standard 6 m radius point count of 10 min duration\n\nwas performed (adapted from Bohnsack &amp; Bannerot, 1986; Samoilys &amp; Carlos, 2000). The\n\npoint count was preferred to other methods because it can deal satisfactorily with the\n\nheterogeneity of the habitats sampled (Bohnsack &amp; Bannerot, 1986). The reduction of\n\nBohnsack &amp; Bannerot\u2019s 7.5 radius point count was due to habitual low visibility in the area\n\nwhich was about 7m. Visual censuses were done during day-light.\n\nTen sites covering the different characteristics of the study area were sampled 111\n\ntimes (Table VI.1). Censuses were always performed at same point along the period\n\nconsidered. Homogenous census design was hampered by the water turbidity and the absence\n\nof specific reef formation within a particular depth strata. Such problem was overcome using\n\nnon-parametric based multivariate analysis (MDS, ANOSIM, etc)\n\nTable VI.1: Census performed by habitats, stations (=local), and depth strata (cabe\u00e7os= knolls, tacis =\nIP, lage=EP)\n\nHabitat Local&lt;10 10-20 >20 Total\nCabe\u00e7os Maragogi 1 7\n\nRubens 1 2\nRubens 2 11\nThierry 06 18\n\nSum 38\nTa\u00e7is \u00c2ncora 16\n\nMaragogi 2 11\nSanta ana 1\n\nSum 28\nLage Carapitanga 3\n\nOs Cl\u00e1ros 37\nRubens 3 5\n\nSum 45\nTotal 48 30 33 111\n\nThe total lengths (TL) of individuals observed were estimated visually to the nearest\n\ncm. Before the study, divers were trained to estimate lengths of fish with wooden models of\n\nfish. Biomass was estimated by converting individual length data to weight using length-\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n113\n\nweight relationships obtained from the REVIZEE program or from the FishBase database\n\nwhen not available. The habitat characteristic of every site was determined qualitatively\n\nwithin 3 categories of geomorphological unit (Knoll, irregular platform, even platform) as\n\ndescribed above.\n\nVI.II.3. Sampling local hand line fishery\n\nThe studied sites as well as fishing zone were chosen aiming at encompassing lutjanids\n\ndistribution. Catch records were obtained from fishermen that fished all year round within the\n\narea surveyed. The fishing effort, estimated by Ferreira et al. (2000) as 49 fishermen per day\n\nin the Tamandar\u00e9 coastal area alone, concentrates along the very near coast, where fishing\n\nground is reached walking (at low tide), swimming or rowing (Ferreira et al., 2000). The\n\ngears used are hand line and spears. Few others operated farther within the area of interest\n\nand used \u2018paquetes\u2019 with sail and use hand line as gear.\n\nNinety-one catches reported at five landing sites within the study area (fishers operating\n\non hard bottoms common to the UVC censused area where snappers occur) were randomly\n\nselected for the analysis. Information was gathered and provided details on the gear, the\n\nspecies, length and weight of individual fish as well as of the total catch weight in order to\n\nestimate the CPUE as number and weight per trip per fisher. From this sampled catches, the\n\nmajor part (over 90%) of the catch originated from knolls at 20m deep.\n\nVI.II.4. Data analysis\n\nData from each UVC was used to calculate fish density (number of individuals per\n\nsampled area), fish biomass (weight per sampled area). Relative abundance were tested for the\n\nmain family according to depth, reef morphology and in/out of the marine protected area\n\nusing Kruskall and Wallis procedure. The Shannon diversity (H\u2019) was estimated at specific\n\nlevels. Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed on diversity to detect differences\n\nbetween groups (depth strata, sampled, reef type). Mean fish density, mean fish length and\n\nmean fish biomass were estimated for the fish community.\n\nComparisons between data from UVC and from fishing activity were carried out\n\nthrough an analysis of the variation of abundance by species and family. In order to detect\n\npatterns of similarity among underwater visual censuses, then between UVC and hand line\n\nfishery records, multidimensional scaling (MDS, see material and methods\u2019 section of chapter\n\n2) representation based on similarity matrix built on Bray-Curtis coefficient was used. As data\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n114\n\nfrom UVC and CPUE are determined with a different effort type, the data used for the joined\n\nanalysis fishery-UVC were standardised using the percentage of the relative abundance\n\ncaught or sighted during a trip or a count. In order to get a realistic comparison between\n\nfishery and UVC abundance estimates, species not vulnerable to fishing activity were\n\nexcluded following the Connell et al. method (1998). Then, only species found in common in\n\nthe two dataset were selected from the joint analysis. Two dimensional MDS plots were\n\npresented with a stress value that measures the \u2018accuracy\u2019 of the representation. According to\n\nClarke (1993), stress values between 0.1 and 0.2 lead to a usable picture, value between 0.2\n\nand 0.25 may picture an inadequate summary then a higher \u2013 dimensional representation was\n\nplotted which had a reduced stress (less than 0.2). However, conclusions from 3-D\n\nrepresentation did not differ from the 2-D plot, therefore 2-D plots only were pictured as it is\n\na much clearer representation.\n\nPossible clusters identified in MDS were tested statistically using the ANOSIM\n\n(analysis of similarities) permutation test (Clarke, 1993; Clarke &amp; Warwick, 1994). Abiotic\n\nfactors as depth, geomorphology (or reef types) were tested for differences between\n\ncommunity structure using the BIO-ENV routine (Clarke &amp; Ainsworth, 1993; Clarke &amp;\n\nWarwick, 1994).\n\nSimilarity of percentage (SIMPER) analysis identified species which typified artisanal\n\ncatches and underwater counts and also identified species which discriminated them (Clarke,\n\n1993).\n\nVI.III. Results\n\nVI.III.1. Underwater visual census (UVC)\n\nIn the fish assemblage studied, 60 species belonging to 21 families was recorded (Table\n\nVI.2), the families with the major number of species were Haemulidae (8 species), followed\n\nby Scaridae (6), Carangidae (6) and Lutjanidae (6). Of the 60 species censused, Haemulon\n\naurolineatum, Chromis multilineata, Acanthurus coeruleus and Sparisoma axillare\n\nrepresented in frequency number over 50%. Scarus zelindae switched Chromis multilineata\n\nrepresented over 50 % of the total biomass censused. The more common species, present\n\nduring most of the census were Cephalopholis fulvus (8 times out of 10) and Acanthurus\n\ncoeruleus (7 times out of 10). The total abundance was 67.1 individuals/census while, the\n\ntotal relative biomass was 9.6 kg/census.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n115\n\nTable VI.2: Species reported during UVC surveys. n, total number of individuals, size range (cm TL)\ncensused, Frequency times of species presence, relative abundance (number (nb) by\ncensuses), relative biomass (weight by censuses) \u2018-\u2018 symbols represents lack of information.\n\nFamilly Species Code n Range\nFrequency\n\n(%)\nRelative abundance\n\n(nb/census)\nRelative biomass\n\n(kg/census)\n\nMuraenidae Gymnothorax funebris Gym fun 1 -

Table VI.6 and\n\nFigure VI.6 suggest that labrids, haemulids and lutjanids were important at deeper range as\n\nwell as on knolls. Acanthurids, scarids, and pempherids were in higher relative abundance and\n\nrelative biomass in shallow water (<20) whilst lutjanids, haemulids were preferentially in\n\ndeeper range (>20m). Among the lutjanids, Lutjanus vivanus did not occur in the visual\n\ncensus as its distribution range was defined much deeper (see Chapter 3). Pomacentrids were\n\nin high relative abundance in shallow water but also showed a maximum abundance in deeper\n\nwater. Contrasting results were found depending on the family considered. Significant\n\nincrease in abundance occurred within MPA for acanthurids, scarids, while a decrease was\n\nreported for labrids, haemulids, lutjanids and serranids.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n121\n\nTable VI.6: Mean density (nb/census) and mean biomass (kg/census) of main fish families per depth,\ntype of reef ad level of protection.\n\nFamily Density Biomass Density Biomass Density Biomass Density Biomass Density Biomass Density Biomass Density Biomass Density Biomass\n\nAcanthuridae 15 5.55 2.783 0.478 1.658 0.227 5.714 1.214 19.556 7.561 22.03 8.835 3.892 0.756 9.937 3.449\nBalistidae 0.043 0.009 0.044 0.009 0.027 0.005 0.018 0.004\nBlenniidae 0.031 0.071 0.027 0.018\nCarangidae 0.077 0.020 0.326 0.106 0.342 0.126 0.156 0.032 0.135 0.036 0.203 0.066 0.180 0.056\nChaetodontidae 0.046 0.001 0.152 0.005 0.132 0.004 0.036 0.001 0.089 0.003 0.054 0.002 0.108 0.004 0.090 0.003\nClupeidae 0.154 0.003 0.357 0.007 0.135 0.003 0.090 0.002\nEphippidae 0.062 0.026 0.630 0.117 0.763 0.142 0.071 0.038 0.044 0.014 0.054 0.018 0.419 0.087 0.297 0.064\nHaemulidae 13.03 1.014 40.93 2.841 45.92 2.929 22 1.285 8.20 1.096 6.243 0.809 33.77 2.252 24.59 1.771\nHolocentridae 0.138 0.008 0.543 0.063 0.500 0.050 0.286 0.019 0.156 0.023 0.027 0.0004 0.446 0.046 0.306 0.031\nKiphosidae 0.015 0.001 0.022 0.002 0.027 0.002 0.009 0.001\n\nLabridae 3.154 0.388 4.370 0.682 4.421 0.669 3.964 0.468 2.822 0.402 2.541 0.328 4.216 0.601 3.658 0.510\nLutjanidae 0.677 0.315 5.435 1.426 6.500 1.709 0.429 0.176 0.778 0.360 0.865 0.420 3.541 0.953 2.649 0.775\nMullidae 0.108 0.014 1.587 0.139 0.974 0.054 0.071 0.003 0.911 0.114 0.135 0.022 1.014 0.087 0.721 0.066\nMuraenidae 0.015 0.002 0.022 0.026 0.036 0.004 0.027 0.002 0.018 0.001\nOstraciidae 0.022 0.029 0.026 0.035 0.014 0.018 0.009 0.012\nPempheridae 4.615 10.714 4.054 2.703\nPomacanthidae 0.138 0.106 0.783 0.340 0.868 0.319 0.286 0.244 0.089 0.080 0.027 0.002 0.595 0.304 0.405 0.203\nPomacentridae 8.323 0.265 13.717 0.642 14.237 0.696 8.179 0.429 8.933 0.183 8.432 0.140 11.622 0.561 10.559 0.421\nScaridae 10.262 2.756 1.913 0.628 1.658 0.408 6.607 2.332 11.267 2.827 13.027 3.077 3.689 1.273 6.802 1.874\nSciaenidae 0.217 0.037 0.263 0.045 0.135 0.023 0.090 0.015\nScombridae 0.077 0.117 0.087 0.126 0.079 0.105 0.133 0.209 0.135 0.206 0.054 0.078 0.081 0.121\nSerranidae 3 0.254 5.043 0.196 5 0.217 2.893 0.117 3.467 0.311 3.081 0.357 4.230 0.166 3.847 0.230\n\nAllEven platform MPA non-MPA0-20 m 20-30 m Knoll irregular platform\n\nVI.III.2.

Great differences in densities and/or biomass\n\nbetween survey methods were found mainly for haemulids (Table VI.9). Haemulids followed\n\nby scarids were globally the dominant family in the UVC whereas lutjanids were the main\n\nfamily of the catch considering the species present in both surveys only.

Fishing activity and visual census did not\n\npresent any family in common on the irregular platform (IP). A single family, Carangidae,\n\nwas fished on the irregular platform structure and was not observed during visual censuses.\n\nOn even platform (EP), only 4 families were common to both surveys (Table VI.9).\n\nRelative abundance in number (density) and biomass (weight) obtained between both\n\nsurvey (fishing vs. UVC) were tested and pictured for the four main families (Fig VI.7, Table\n\nVI.10).

Discussion\n\nUnderwater visual census dataset was analysed using univariate and multivariate\n\ntechniques then compared to local hand-line fishery in order to investigate whether estimates\n\nof relative species abundance index as measured by CPUE are comparable with estimates\n\nmeasured by UVC in a multispecies reef fish fishery.\n\nVI.IV.1. Environmental variables and composition of fish assemblages\n\nAlthough no difference in diversity (H\u2019) was detected between sites even between sites\n\nwith no human activity in the last 3 years (sites \u2018Claros\u2019 located on the border of the marine\n\nprotected area \u2018Costa dos Corais\u2019) multivariate techniques such as ANOSIM test presented\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n130\n\nsignificantly different densities. The apparent stability of Shannon diversity index even\n\nthough the fish structure presenting differences may be explained by the fact that univariate\n\ntechniques reduce the full set of species recorded in a sample into a single coefficient and by\n\ndoing so fail in detecting species replacement, as often species richness and/or abundance\n\nremain the same.\n\nVisual analysis based on ordination diagrams provides a direct and relatively simple\n\nmean of ecological interpretation. Exploratory analysis using MDS plot complemented by\n\nANOSIM procedure helped us to determine what factor may influence fish distribution. In the\n\npresent case, the result of the various statistical techniques applied to fish abundance were in\n\nclose agreement, complemented each other, and suggested that the depth gradient remains the\n\nmain factor along to the geomorphology as it is already known that morphological properties\n\nof the coral reef determine the structure of the fish assemblages (Sale, 1980). Some authors,\n\nmentioned the predation hypothesis in which predators may cause competition among their\n\nprey for refuge space (Holt, 1984). Other studies suggest that fish select the smallest possible\n\nreef structure holes to decrease predation risk (Shulman, 1984; Hixon &amp; Beets, 1989).\n\nThe change of habitat characteristics induced significant changes in the community\n\nstructure though the diversity was similar at each site. A species switch occurred instead of an\n\nincrease or a domination of a particular species as it seems that complexity changes may\n\nbenefits some species (Angel &amp; Ojeda, 2001; Ferreira et al., 2001; Charbonnel et al., 2002;\n\nWillis &amp; Anderson, 2003).\n\nDifferences in fish assemblage between depth strata has been commonly found in the\n\nliterature as well as our study focusing on Lutjanids (chapter 3). Although the depth range\n\nwas much smaller than the one considered in chapter 3, species assemblage and species\n\nabundance was mainly defined by the depth gradient. The 20 m isobath appeared to be a\n\nborder line between to type of species assemblage. Considering this variable (depth strata)\n\ndata considered fishery dependent and fishery independent resulted in similar patterns.\n\nLarge predators such as snapper, jacks, or groupers were poorly represented in the UVC\n\nsurveys. However, they represented a large part of the total biomass of the area (see\n\nEstatpesca, 2000). The limitations of the method (UVC tends to underestimate predatory\n\nspecies in intensely fished areas as fish become more wary) and the location of censuses to a\n\nfixed depth range, no more than 30m deep, may have caused biases in estimating large\n\npredator species. Furthermore, the baited hook and line gear, used for the determination of the\n\nCPUE, may bias the estimate as it will select preferentially carnivorous.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n131\n\nAlthough the no-take area fish assemblage presented some significant differences, the\n\nspecies diversity was not higher than other sites. However, this observation may be due to the\n\nfact that the site \u2018Os claros\u2019 is close to the borderline and that part of the data was collected at\n\nbeginning of the closure date, allowing not enough time for recovery and therefore a real\n\nchange in the assemblage.\n\nVI.IV.2. Comparisons of reef fish abundance using (visual census) versus\n\ncommercial catch and effort data\n\nCatch per unit effort (CPUE) measurement is commonly used as an index of abundance.\n\nIn this study, the representation of the fish assemblage through CPUE surveys differed\n\nsignificantly from UVC surveys. Different selectivity of both methods lead to such\n\nconclusion. UVC surveys as well as CPUE surveys could present underestimation or over-\n\nestimation according of the species censused. Visual census present many well described\n\nbiases (see for a review Harmelin-Vivien et al., 1985; Jennings &amp; Polunin, 1995a; Samoilys\n\n&amp; Carlos, 2000). Accuracy and precision of the census may vary according to the area, time\n\nof the day, season as well as environmental factors such as topography, visibility,\n\ntemperature, species richness. Also, there are two distinct fish faunas on coral reef: the diurnal\n\nand the nocturnal fish. Most species of lutjanids, holocentrids, clupeids are nocturnal\n\n(Longhurst &amp; Pauly, 1987). This profound change that occurs at twilight will have an\n\nimportant effect on UVC estimates of the total fish abundance and could affect the\n\ncatchability (and consequently the CPUE estimates). In this study however, this bias will not\n\naccount for differences between UVC and CPUE surveys as fishing and underwater activities\n\nwere carried out at daytime.\n\nIn spite of standardisation and transformation of data the two survey methods were\n\ndiscriminated by the multivariate analysis. However, some degrees of similarities were found\n\nwhen reef knolls characteristics were observed. This may be explained by the fact that the\n\ninfluence range both techniques and that the local structure influences the dispersion or\n\nconversely the concentration of the resource. In the case of reef knoll, fish are somewhat\n\nconcentrated around the knoll which make the influence range of the baited hook is similar to\n\nthe point count radius. As dispersion is stronger in the other geomorphological units\n\ndifference may increase between the survey methods. Further, stronger relationship may occur\n\nfor single species, or group of species that present similar ecological characteristics, and\n\nunder homogeneous fishing conditions (i. e. same period). For instance, lutjanids\u2019 estimates\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n132\n\nwere similar in both surveys. Similarly, density and biomass of haemulids were not found\n\ndifferent on even platform, although this result was mainly due to a high variance, resulting\n\nfrom the occasional occurrence of large schools of juveniles, within the UVC survey.\n\nCatch and effort data, obtained from commercial data, do not come from controlled\n\nexperiments therefore involve the untested assumption that the CPUE is proportional to\n\nabundance. As a result, the answers that we obtain are not clean or clear (Hilborn &amp; Mangel,\n\n1997). Conversely, several studies had shown that visual counts could obtain accurate\n\nestimates of abundance providing an adequate method for the group of species studied\n\n(Samoilys, 1997; Samoilys &amp; Carlos, 2000). It has therefore been used to obtain fishery-\n\nindependent stock assessment of reef fish, such as New Caledonia (Letourneur et al., 2000).\n\nHowever both methods do have biases, although from different origins. A combination of\n\nboth methods should therefore add confidence in assessment of reef fish abundance (Connell\n\net al., 1998). Best correlated estimates of CPUE and UVC may be obtained using Kulbicki\u2019s\n\nmethod (1988) in which CPUE obtained using experimental fishing at the same time, same\n\nplace and with a large number of replicates as it would minimise error sources from spatial\n\nand temporal variations (see also Kulbicki et al. 2000). Many biases that may arise are\n\nspecific to each method, and a global approach taking in account both indexes may benefit an\n\nbetter understanding on exploited reef environment.\n\nCatch-per-unit-effort in fisheries science and underwater visual surveys in marine\n\necology are widely accepted for providing estimates of relative abundance. Both methods will\n\nbring complementary information for better knowledge on the habitat along to the fishery\n\nprocesses, but linking both methods needs further research before being widely used.\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\n133\n\nMain conclusions\n\n\u2022 No spatial variation was found in term of diversity. Although catch composition\n\nvaried, species switched according to the depth gradient and to\n\ngeomorphological units, the species richness and diversity stayed at a similar\n\nlevel (species replacement).\n\n\u2022 No large predators were found in the UVC records as censuses did not\n\nencompass their range of distribution.\n\n\u2022 The type of geomorphological units seems to be an important factor influencing\n\nthe species composition as further study should be developed to quantify such\n\neffect.\n\n\u2022 CPUE estimates varied from UVC indexes on the overall. However, sampling\n\nperformed on knolls for lutjanids were found similar. This may be explain by the\n\nfact that fish assemblage is restricted to a confined area where both survey\n\nmethods present a similar operating range.\n\n\u2022 Best results would probably be obtained with controlled fishing and UVC\n\nexperiments on several identical sits.\n\n\n\nGeneral discussion\n\n134\n\nChapter VII. General discussion\n\nThe Brazilian effort for the development of the scientific knowledge necessary for the\n\nsustainable use of the resources within the Exclusive Economic Zone was represented by the\n\nREVIZEE program. This collective endeavour aimed the study of the ecosystem of Exclusive\n\nEconomic Zone, in its physical, social, and biological characteristics. The fishery science part\n\nof the program, which collected data on species and fleet from 1996 to 2000, gave the\n\nopportunity to perform, for the first time in the Northeast region, a diagnostic of the fishing\n\nactivity and its impact on fish assemblage. Regarding reef fishes, this study was an appraisal\n\nof the sustainability of the fishery, through catch analyses and stock assessment, a definition\n\nof relevant management plan as well as a critical analysis of the sampling program used (for\n\nimprovement of future design).\n\nIn fisheries stock assessment, the major part of effort goes into the determination of the\n\nstock status relative to biological reference points, such as levels of fishing mortality,\n\nspawning biomass or age structure, or to obtain diagnostics that may warn manager and\n\nscientists against serious depletion or collapse. Stock assessment relies upon the estimation of\n\nmany parameters and requires extensive current and historical data measured from the fishery\n\nand from independent biomass surveys (Pitcher &amp; Preikshot, 2001). Stock assessment,\n\nalthough sometimes only viewed as an interpretation of commercial catch statistics to\n\nestimate potential yield and/or limitations, is far more than that. Hilborn and Walters (1992)\n\nstated that, \u2018first and foremost, stock assessment involves understanding the dynamics of\n\nfisheries\u2019. Fisheries are much more than fish catch and fishermen are an important component\n\nof the dynamic system.\n\nIn this thesis, I conducted a baseline characterisation and fishery management analyses\n\nusing a wide range of methods in fish stock assessment including mathematical and statistical\n\nmodelling to provide a quantitative baseline assessment of the distribution and status of reef\n\nfishery resources. Four general areas have been investigated in the present study: (1) the\n\ndynamic of the commercial reef fishery in northeastern Brazil (Chapter 2); (2) the bathymetric\n\ntrends of snappers through their exploitation (Chapter 3); (3) the development and\n\napplicability of traditional stock assessment models (Chapter 4) and of those which are\n\nsuitable for multi-gear and multispecific fisheries (Chapters 5); and (4) the use of alternative,\n\nfishery independent, information gathered by underwater visual censuses (UVC) (Chapter 6)\n\n\n\nGeneral discussion\n\n135\n\nfor a better understanding of the exploited environment as well as auxiliary information for\n\nfishery management.\n\nDefining the reef fishery dynamic in the Northeast Brazil.\n\nMany multivariate methods applied to fishery data have been performed in order to\n\ndistinguish phenomena such as spatial pattern, fishery power, gear selectivity related to\n\nfishing trip or survey (Clarke &amp; Warwick, 1994; Pech &amp; Lalo\u00eb, 1997; Garcia et al., 1998;\n\nLegendre &amp; Legendre, 1998; Pitcher et al., 1998; Preikshot &amp; Pauly, 1998; Pelletier &amp;\n\nFerraris, 2000; Rice, 2000; Pitcher &amp; Preikshot, 2001; Stergiou et al., 2002; Willis &amp;\n\nAnderson, 2003). In fishery science, the simultaneous analysis of various components of the\n\nenvironment and the biomass related to the exploited populations may allow a better\n\nunderstanding of the environment and fishery dynamic improving the information needed for\n\nthe development of a management plan (Gaertner, 1997).\n\nNon-parametric multivariate analyses such as non-metric multi-dimensional scaling\n\n(MDS) and relatives (ANOSIM, BIO-ENV, etc) provided a way of dealing with problematic\n\nunderlying distributions of abundances (Kruskall, 1964). Its weaker assumption of ordinal\n\nrather than interval information greatly increases robustness in the face of irregular\n\ndistributions of abundance and high sampling variance. As a result, MDS has become a\n\nwidely used technique for ecological ordinations of benthic and fish communities (Clarke,\n\n1993; Clarke &amp; Ainsworth, 1993). In fishery science, the incorporation of non-biological\n\nfactors provided a important tool to better understand fishing dynamics (Pitcher et al., 1998;\n\nPreikshot &amp; Pauly, 1998). Such knowledge facilitated fishery researcher to focus on specific\n\ninformation to maximise a sampling program (money, effort and personnel). The\n\ncomplementarity of these techniques allow the knowledge of the structure and the dynamics\n\nof the fishing activity. Spatial segregation of fleet operation along with distribution range of\n\nspecies may also improve the development of future sampling and management program on a\n\nspatial aspect. In this study, such techniques helped to typify the reef fishery\u2019s components of\n\nthe Northeast of Brazil (Chapter 2). Within the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, snappers were\n\nfound to be the main part of the artisanal catch. Also, while exploring the catch data, it was\n\npossible to visualise that each state showed a specific characteristic in term of fleet dynamic\n\nand therefore catch composition. This chapter was essential in understanding the fishery\n\ndynamic of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil, hence helping the adaptation of the stock\n\nassessment models further applied within the reality of the fishery in the region (Chapters 4\n\nand 5).\n\n\n\nGeneral discussion\n\n136\n\nIn order to better understand how the fleet dynamic is related to the snappers dynamic,\n\nthe primary group of species driving the fishery, their distribution and relationship with the\n\nfishery dynamic was studied The ontogenetic depth distribution of snappers as well as the\n\nfleet operating distribution were described for management purpose. Implication of the fleet\n\ndynamic and consequently fishing effect on lutjanid population was discussed.\n\nFish stock assessment and fishery management in Northeast Brazil\n\nFisheries in both developed and developing countries are often reported to be in crisis.\n\nFishery systems are complex, inherently variable and incompletely understood. The\n\ncombination of these factors creates considerable uncertainty, which must be respected both\n\nin fisheries evaluation and in implementation of management regimes. Wherever there is\n\nuncertainty, there is risk, and this must be considered (Buckworth, 1998). In the fishing\n\nindustry, the range of risk is enormous, because it deals with environmental factors and\n\nvolatile markets, changes in harvesting management strategy, socio-economic considerations,\n\npolitical \u2018imperatives\u2019 and economic reality (Lucena, 2000). Uncertainties need to be\n\nidentified and uncertainty reduced to encourage the taking of risk (in terms of management\n\noption) (Penhorn, 1999). A feature of \u2018controllable\u2019 uncertainties can only be managed\n\nsuccessfully, i.e. risk be reduced, if they form the basis of an integrated comprehensive\n\nfishery management that embraces socio-economic considerations and harvest strategies.\n\nThe uncertainty and a poor knowledge of the resources are major setbacks for the\n\ndevelopment of a suitable assessment and management of fish stocks in developing countries\n\n(Lucena, 2000). Thus model with few data need were preferred. In the present case, simple\n\ncatch-at-age models incorporating characteristics of the multi-fleet exploitation and biology of\n\nthe species were developed (Chapters 4 and 5).\n\nOnce the dynamic of the reef fishery and the part of ecology of the species were\n\ncharacterised, the next logical step was to explore stock assessment model that would be used\n\nto evaluate the current status of the exploited stock as well as to allow simulated scenario for\n\nmanagement purposes. Additionally, one should also better assess biological / ecological\n\ncharacteristics of the exploited species (i.e. reproduction, size at first maturity, etc).\n\nTraditional models were employed (Chapter 4) and the advantages and limitations of the\n\ntechniques were discussed. Non-equilibrium models, such as real cohort VPA, provided\n\ncoherent results. Model extensions that deal with the multifleet and multispecies aspect of the\n\nreef fishery were used in the Chapter 5. It was evident that different fleets played distinctive\n\nroles on the life history of the snappers. Fleets with different operation capacities will affect\n\n\n\nGeneral discussion\n\n137\n\nstocks on different ways and this is mainly related to the fleet power, which is related to fleet\n\ncategory. \u2018Jangadas\u2019 and \u2018paquetes\u2019 had a major effect on stock of L. synagris since they\n\noperate in shallower waters whereas L. analis and L. jocu were more affected by \u2018boats\u2019\n\n(BOM and BOV). For each species, the multifleet aspects of the reef fishery was also evident,\n\nL. jocu, for example, had all stages of its life history exploited but, distinctively for each fleet\n\nin agreement with the combined effect of fish distribution and fleet operating position,\n\n\u2018paquete\u2019 mainly exploits the young individuals and \u2018boat\u2019 exploitation relies on larger\n\nindividuals (Chapter 3).\n\nWhen fishery dependent data has the potential to be biased by many factor (such for\n\ninstance, under-reporting, lack of cooperation, gear selectivity), fishery independent data can\n\nprovide measure on reef fish abundance and community composition. As a result, quantitative\n\nmultispecies stock assessment methods as an integrated assessment should help for\n\nmanagement decisions regarding fish stocks at broader levels.\n\nFishery independent information were used to get a picture of an ecological \u2018hot spot\u2019,\n\nwhere management attempts are set up, and to assess the relationship between catch-per-unit-\n\nof-effort (CPUE) through comparisons of abundance estimates obtained by underwater visual\n\ncensuses (UVC) and by inshore fishery survey (Chapter 6). Fish composition varied\n\naccordingly to the habitat type. CPUE estimates varied from UVC indexes on the overall.\n\nHowever, sampling performed on knolls for lutjanids were found similar. This may be\n\nexplained by the fact that lutjanid assemblage is restricted to a confined area where both\n\nsurvey methods present a similar operating range. Although at this point no clear conclusion\n\ncan be made about the relationship between UVC and CPUE method, it was shown that a non\n\ndestructive fishery independent method should bring a valuable source of information\n\n(Kulbicki et al., 2000; Letourneur et al., 2000). This would become even more important\n\nwhen spatial management strategies such as marine protected areas or \u2018no-take\u2019 areas are\n\nimplemented because these methods are able to address estimation of mortality rates within\n\nand outside the closed area without reliance of fishery catch data and does so in a non-\n\ndestructive way (Ault et al., 2001).\n\nSurvey design. Gathering more and better information\n\nDifferences may occur between research survey data and commercial data as fishers\n\nfocus on their activity on target species and particular zone according to their experience and\n\nto the economic market interest, whereas scientific surveys fishes without optimising the\n\ncatch nor target fishing activity on some species of commercial interest. However, additional\n\ninformation from research survey that may be standardised and may determine precise\n\n\n\nGeneral discussion\n\n138\n\nestimates of CPUE as well as spatial structure will greatly improve our view of the stock in\n\nterms of abundance and distribution.\n\nThis study also presents the quantitative bases required for future preparation of an\n\noptimal sampling design analysis that produces precise statistics required for future\n\nimplementation of a fishery management plan for the Northeast of Brazil. Results of this\n\nstudy will help to subsequent development of an efficient monitoring design that could\n\noptimise, in a cost-effective way, the precision of estimates for key management system\n\nefficacy. Chapters 4 and 5 draws attention to the fact that putting a large piece of effort in\n\ncollecting \u2018basic\u2019 data does not completely fill our expectation for a satisfactory management\n\naction. Time-series with catch estimates at specific level are needed in order to carry out any\n\ntype of model. For instance, catch-at-age model has best performances when at least the entire\n\ncohort is taken into account (in the snappers case, at least 19 years).\n\nFurthermore, a broad sampling design should be conducted to gather auxiliary\n\ninformation that would help to define a holistic picture of the exploited ecosystem, namely\n\nmapping of fishing effort in a greater detail and precision, identification of fishing ground\n\n(localisation, identification of species caught by site), increase of the resolution and precision\n\nof base \u2018habitat\u2019 maps for key environment variables (reef complexity, bathymetry, reef\n\nmapping), best knowledge of fishers behaviour, technological characteristics (gears, boat)\n\ngathered by routine census at landings sites. Such information may not be too difficult to\n\ncollect depending on the capacity of the socio-economic pattern and fishery scientist to\n\ncooperate. In this study, although the sample design of did not totally fulfil our expectations,\n\nmanagement recommendations can emerge despite the complexity of the fishery.\n\nRecommendations for the management plan of the reef fishery in Northeast Brazil.\n\nManagement actions can be divided into catch controls, effort controls, and technical\n\nmeasures (Jennings et al., 2001). Catch controls limit the catches of fishers or the fleet as a\n\nwhole, effort controls limit the numbers of fishers in the fishery and what they can do, while\n\ntechnical measures control the catch that they can be made for a given effort (OECD, 1997).\n\nCatch control are amongst the most widely used management regulations. A catch quota\n\nor catch-limitation system as a straight measure may be efficient if supported by an effective\n\nmonitoring and surveillance scheme (Nagasaki &amp; Chikuni, 1989) and accepted on a social\n\nbasis. However, it is true that catch limitation is generally impractical and hardly applicable in\n\nthe Northeast of Brazil. Reef fishing activity is mainly performed by poor people and the\n\ncharacteristic of the activity that present highly spread landing sites make controls difficult.\n\n\n\nGeneral discussion\n\n139\n\nAlso, there are some disadvantages from a biological and social point of view. The\n\nexpectation of a reduction of a specific catch may not be always fulfilled and the process\n\ninvolved in the reduction of a catch is generally a vague one (Nagasaki &amp; Chikuni, 1989).\n\nFurthermore, the recovery of depleted resources may require a long time, particularly for\n\nlong-living species such as the lutjanids studied. In a technical point of view, catch quotas\n\nmanagement tends to encourage a race to fish amongst fishers in order to maximise their share\n\nof the quota (the fishery is closed when the aggregated catch equals total allowable catch).\n\nThis would encourage the \u2018overcapacity\u2019 as larger and more powerful vessel will compete\n\nmore efficiently.\n\nEffort controls aims to reduce the fishing mortality by limiting the fishing power\n\nthrough the restriction of the number of fishers, boats in activity, amount, size and type of\n\ngear and/or vessel they use. Effort control can be implemented through licences. Licences\n\nrestrict the number of boat or fishers in the fishery. Technical measures restrict the size and\n\nsex of fished species that are caught or landed, the gear used and the times when, or areas\n\nwhere, fishing is allowed. Restrictions occur with the area and/or period closed to fishing.\n\nEfficiency of size control, as for catch control, will depend on effective monitoring and\n\nsurveillance capacity. In Brazil, such control would only be efficient on motorised boat as\n\nthey are the easiest fleet to control efficiently. From the various management options\n\navailable, few are really applicable in the Northeast of Brazil. One of them that is being\n\nimplemented in the Northern Brazil, is the a local initiative started by \u2018Projeto Recifes\n\nCosteiros\u2019 (www.recifescosteiros.org.br) within the protected area \u2018APA dos Corais\u2019 that\n\nmake use of fishing right licences. Fishing licence is only available to the local community\n\nwhich in return shall help to enforce regulation as it is of its own interest to make the fishing\n\nexploitation sustainable.\n\nThroughout this thesis the technical diversity of the fishery, the selection and\n\napplication of assessment methods and how fishing affects species was described. Thus, how\n\nfishery science can inform the management process and what can be achieved through\n\nmanagement? One of the main findings of this thesis was that the spatial component (through\n\nthe distribution of snapper, fleet allocation and fishing ground position) was the major factor\n\nacting on the reef fishery dynamic. Also, it was reported for most fish species a status of fully\n\nor over-exploitation. In this situation, regulation will only be adopted when fish stocks and the\n\nfishing industry will become so depressed that the need for action is truly compelling (Rettig,\n\n1987).\n\n\n\nGeneral discussion\n\n140\n\nOthers measures such as establishment of smaller no take zones (3-4 km\u00b2) inside the\n\nAPA, the moratorium on exploitation of vulnerable species at risk (namely the lord-of-the-\n\nrocks Epinephelus itajara and the nurse shark Ginglymostoma cirratum), closed seasons\n\nduring reproduction (shrimp and lobster), and minimum allowed size (red snapper Lutjanus\n\npurpureus and lobster) were already implemented.\n\nTo improve the management in the northeastern of Brazil, two additional propositions\n\nare suggested based on the findings of this study : (1) technical measure restringing the\n\nfishing area and (2) the effort restriction by control on fleet\u2019s \u2018fishing power\u2019.\n\nIn regard to the implementation of a restricted area, in a tropical multispecific\n\nframework, which is in most cases not well studied fisheries, management will have to be\n\nimplemented without good scientific knowledge. As such, closed area may provide a means\n\nof doing this. The use of restricted area for fishing, specially in tropical region, already\n\nevidenced an increase of diversity, biomass, mean size and fecundity (Russ, 1991). In the\n\nNortheast Brazil, the protected area \u2018APA marinha costa dos corais\u2019 established a clear rise of\n\ndiversity and biomass within a \u2018no-take area\u2019 established in 1999 (Ferreira et al., 2000).\n\nSnappers are relatively sedentary fishes (by opposition to migratory fishes) after recruitment\n\nto the reef and, a closed area, would help to reduce fishing mortality on part of the population.\n\nAs due to the fish distribution as seen in the Chapter 3 only part of the of the life cycle is\n\ncontained within the protected area. Thus, in such context, protected area might be most\n\nefficient if set towards the off-shore in an attempt to protect the entire range of fish\n\ndistribution and consequently the entire life cycle of the species. If the implementation of such\n\nwide area would not be possible, then a network of closed areas would provide the best\n\nalternative to protect various phases of the life cycle of target species and thus to be a guard\n\nagainst fishery collapse (Bohnsack, 1998).Such network should encompass a full range of\n\nmarine and coastal ecosystems following four principles (SCBD, 2004): (1)\n\nRepresentativeness, all biogeographic regions should be represented and within each region,\n\nall major habitats should be represented (2) replication, all the habitats should be replicated\n\nwithin the network (3) viability, the network should be ecologically viable avoiding isolation\n\n(4) precautionary design, a precautionary approach should be taken whenever there is\n\nuncertainty. The aim of the MPA network should be to create a coherent entity and not only a\n\ncollection of individual MPA. A critical issue is the proportion of marine space protected\n\nfollowed by the connectivity between closed areas as the viability of one area may depend on\n\nwhat happens elsewhere. The biodiversity commission recommendation (SCBD, 2004) is that\n\nprotected area should cover at least 30% of the total area to have an effective protection and\n\n\n\nGeneral discussion\n\n141\n\nthat connectivity between MPA takes into account the following: (1) allow species to continue\n\nto access their required range of food sources (2) allow species to continue to access their\n\nrequired range of habitat during their life cycle and (3) maintain metapopulation complex.\n\nAlternatively, in the case of social pressure against permanent closed area and/or\n\nenforcement difficulties temporary closed areas could be used to implement rotational\n\nharvesting strategies (Jennings et al., 2001). Traditional management before modern fishery\n\nmanagers often chose to harvest on a rotational basis. In Brazilian reef fishery this concept is\n\noften used as fishers go to some ground for a while and leave it when catch reduce to an\n\nunsustainable level, then they return after a period of time (Ferreira, pers com).\n\nAlthough, results showed that motorised boats have the main effect on the yield,\n\nrestriction on the fishing power of such fleet would be a political and social decision that is\n\nmost likely impossible to take in the current economical context of Brazil and hardly\n\napplicable. However, a licence scheme, like already established within the protected area after\n\na decree by IBAMA in march 2002 and implemented by the \u2018Projeto Recife Costeiros\u2019, would\n\nbe an efficient alternative that promote the local fishers over fishers from other regions. In this\n\nway, local fishers will be part of the enforcement of the regulations. Regarding the results of\n\nthis study, however, it seems that licences should be applied not only on fishermen but also on\n\npowered boats, not only because they were pointed out having a major effect on yield but also\n\nbased on the fact that the remaining fishery partners would hardly be controllable (there are\n\nmany unregistered \u2018paquete\u2019 and \u2018jangada\u2019).\n\nSuch recommendation go against the ultimate fishing policies elaborated by the\n\nBrazilian government entity (Secretaria Especial de Aq\u00fcicultura e Pesca, SEAP). Indeed,\n\npolitical decisions which is currently towards giving incentives to develop national fisheries.\n\nIn the light of our findings, this initiative should be not encouraged for the reef fishery in\n\nNortheast Brazil. However, initiatives such as management strategy using protected area\n\ninvolving the local communities are being developed. Economical alternatives that reduce the\n\nfishing impact as well as educative action for local population will also help the\n\nimplementation of such management plan.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n142\n\nReferences\n\nAcosta, A. and Appeldoorn, R.S.

Mutton snapper, L. analis, yellowtail snapper, L.\nchrysurus, and dog snapper, L. jocu were mainly caught at intermediate depth (20-80m) whereas lane\nsnapper, L. synagris, and silk snapper, L. vivanus, inhabit respectively shallow (<20m) and deep (>80\nm) waters. Each fleet category, exploit preferentially a particular combination of species and their\n\nsize range. The fleet dynamic of the Northeast Brazil is technologically heterogeneous and determines\n\nthe catch composition. Geographical distribution of the fishery and technical interaction between\n\nfleets and gears should be considered by the management of these species in order to maintain the\n\nsustainability of the stock and to guarantee the continuance of the resource.\n\nKeywords: Fish distribution, technological interaction, artisanal fishery, Lutjanids, reefs\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe abundance of marine species fluctuates in\n\nspace and time. Such fluctuations may be due to\nphysical (currents, temperature, etc.), or biological\nprocesses (as growth and mortality) as well as\nbehavioural processes (migration, habitat use)\n(Jennings et al., 2001). Various studies have been\nconducted on spatial and/or temporal distribution\nof reef fish communities, as size dependent\nprocesses have long been recognised as important\nfor the community structure and resources (Sale,\n1980; Gobert, 1994).\n\nFishes are an important component of reef\nenvironment as they influence the structure of the\ncommunities through predation, competition, and\nterritoriality processes (Sale, 1980). The\ncomplexity of the interaction on the reef\necosystem turns study on fishing effect rather\ndifficult (Jennings &amp; Polunin, 1995; Polunin &amp;\nRoberts, 1996). In Brazil, various species are\nexploited by fishermen mostly using hook and\nline, gill nets and traps. Reef fisheries, which\noperate mainly in the northeastern, have an\nimportant role in the socio-economic life of the\nregion (Ferreira &amp; Maida, 2001). However, very\n\nlittle is known on the fisheries dynamics operating\nin this area and their effects on reef fish\ncommunities.\n\nIt is rather common to observe size distribution\naccording to depth for reef fishes (MacPherson &amp;\nDuarte, 1991; Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992).\nConsidering the fishery activity, a common pattern\nobserved for target species is the increase of the\nnumber of large specimens in the catches with\nincreasing depth (Roberts, 1996). This pattern has\nbeen attributed to two main natural processes:\nontogenetic migrations from coastal reefs to the\nexternal part of the shelf or depth related growth\nand mortality rates. While migration may be\nrelated to availability of suitable prey for juvenile\nfish or predation avoidance (Roberts, 1996),\ndifferential growth and mortality may be related to\nenvironmental factors. Temperature variation\naccording to the depth gradient leads to variation\nin basal metabolism rates and therefore may alter\nthe growth rate (Longhurst &amp; Pauly, 1987).\nDetermining the natural pattern of distribution is\nspecially important for species that are targeted by\nfisheries, as the effects of fishing in a population\nmay also be extended to population parameters.\n\nCoral reef formations in Brazil extend for\napproximately 3000 km along the Northeastern\n\n\n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \u2013 BABT in press\n\n2\n\ncoast (Maida &amp; Ferreira, 1997). They are\nconstituted by organic substrates built with coral,\nalgae and mollusc skeletons. The continental shelf\nvaries from 45 to 60 km wide in Cear\u00e1 and Rio\nGrande do Norte, then becomes relatively narrow\nin Pernambuco coasts, to wide again in the south\nof Bahia, reaching 200 km (Maida &amp; Ferreira,\n1997). Brazilian reef fishes are intensively\nexploited by artisanal fisheries that concentrate on\nthe reef formations distributed along the\ncontinental shelf up to the continental slope and\nover oceanic banks (Ferreira et al., 1998; Ferreira\n&amp; Maida, 2001).\n\nIn the Northeast Brazil, reef fishes represent 46\n% (of which lutjanids represent 20%) of the total\ncatch of the main target species in weight (total\ncatch: 26171 tonnes). The 54% remaining is\nconstituted by the pelagic and the deep-sea\ndemersal fauna (Estatpesca, 2000). During the end\nof the 60\u2019s, the 70\u2019s, 80\u2019s, 90\u2019s and the beginning\nof 2000\u2019s, lutjanids\u2019 catches in the Northeast\nBrazil ranged between 34%, 11341 tonnes during\nthe 60\u2019s, and 43%, 77422 tonnes during the 80\u2019s.\nDuring the 60\u00b4s and 70\u00b4s, the most valuable and\nmost frequently caught species in Northeast Brazil\nwere the red snapper, Lutjanus purpureus (Poey\n1866), and in minor proportions, L. analis. From\n1978 with the collapse of the red snapper fishery,\nothers species as L. jocu, L. chrysurus, and more\nrecently, L. synagris, constitute the major part of\nthe lutjanids catch in Northeast Brazil (65%)\n(SUDEPE, 1967-1979; IBGE, 1980-1989;\nIBAMA, 190-2001)1.\n\nAccording to Ferreira et al. (2001), fisheries in\nBrazilian reefs may be divided into two types.\nFirst, the activity of recreational and artisanal scale\nfishermen occurs nearby the coast in shallow\nwaters and reefs formations. Fishing point may be\nreached by swimming or using rowing or sailing\ncanoes. Secondly, the medium scale commercial\nfisheries that operates by the coastal part of the\nshelf, using sailing or motorised boats that reach\ndeeper waters as far as the shelf break. Only\nmotorised boats, that may operate also on the\nbanks far from the coast, have storing capacity\n(Ferreira &amp; Maida, 2001). Along the Northeastern\ncoast, snappers represent one of the main\n\n1 Brazilian fisheries statistic: Superintend\u00eancia do\nDesenvolvimento da Pesca (SUDEPE), 1967-1979; Instituto\nBrasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica (IBGE), 1980-1989;\nInstituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos\nNaturais Renov\u00e1veis IBAMA, 1990-2001.\n\nresources in terms of abundance and fishermen\u00b4s\nincome (Santos, 2001). Generally demersal, the\nsnappers are tropical and sub tropical fishes that\nare distributed on reefs down to depths about 450\nm (Allen, 1985; Polovina &amp; Ralston, 1987). Top\npredators, they consume a broad range of prey\ngenerally dominated by fish. They show low\ngrowth and natural mortality rates (Manooch,\n1987). Snappers produce eggs with pelagic\ndispersion (Grimes, 1987).\n\nOur study focused on five species of Lutjanus,\nwhich inhabit coastal to deep demersal waters.\nThe main species caught by the artisanal fishery in\nNortheast of Brazil were looked at: the mutton\nsnapper L. analis (Cuvier, 1828), the yellowtail\nsnapper L. chrysurus (Bloch, 1791), the dog\nsnapper L. jocu (Bloch and Schneider, 1801), the\nlane snapper L. synagris (Linnaeus, 1758) and the\nsilk snapper L. vivanus (Cuvier, 1828). The\ndistribution and relative abundance of these\nspecies along a depth gradient, across the\nNortheast Brazil continental shelf and upper slope\nwas described. The effects of the reef fishery on\ndistribution, size of fish and CPUE of snappers\nconsidering the relationship between the species\ndistribution and the dynamics of the fleets (gear\nused, fleet category and operating area) were also\ndiscussed.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nStudy site and data collection\nMost of the data for this study was collected as\n\npart of a national programme called REVIZEE\n(Evaluation of the Potential of the Live Resources\nfrom Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone), which\nwas established in 1996 in order to provide\ninformation on the biology and fishery of its main\nresources. Another programme \u201cProjeto Recifes\nCosteiros\u201d complemented the dataset available on\nthe artisanal fishery in Pernambuco. A\ncomparative analysis was applied to the reef\nfisheries distributed over 2000 km of coast\nencompassing five Brazilian states (Cear\u00e1, Rio\nGrande do Norte, Pernambuco, Alagoas and\nBahia) through a five-year sampling programme.\nIt was gathered information regarding the fishing\ntactics (fishing area, gear used, target groups, etc)\nand catch composition of fleet operating in the\nregion.\n\nData were collected from August 1996 to\nMarch 2000. Species were identified and\n\n\n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \u2013 BABT in press\n\n3\n\nmeasured in situ (fork length FL). The landings\nsites were chosen in order to get a representative\npicture of the catch composition in the region.\nSites were localised over the five states cited\nabove. In addition, some data were collected from\nresearch vessels that operated on the banks and\noceanic islands (Atol das Rocas and Arquip\u00e9lago\nde S\u00e3o Pedro e S\u00e3o Paulo) off the Rio Grande do\nNorte coast.\n\nFishermen were interviewed and information\nregarding the operation within the fishery and\ncatch were collected. Within the REVIZEE\nframework, more than 69 000 records of fishes\nsupplied by 2400 trips were gathered. For this\nstudy, nearly 22 000 fishes, which had information\non depth, were considered amongst the 5 species\nof Lutjanus (Table 1).\n\nTable 1: Number of four lutjanid species sampled\nfrom august 1996 to March 2000 with information\non depth by states.\n\nInformation on specific landings and effort\n(number of boats) by fleet category were collected\nfor the studied period by the program\n\u2018ESTATPESCA\u2019 held by the Brazilian\nEnvironmental Agency for official statistics\n(IBAMA, Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e\ndos Recursos Naturais Renovaveis). The reef\nfishery can be distributed into five categories of\nfleets classified as following, from the most\nrudimental to the most technically advanced fleet:\n\u201cPaquete\u201d (PQT), \u201cJangada\u201d (JAN), \u201cBote a vela\u201d\n(BOV), \u201cBote\u201d (BOT), \u201cBote motorizado\u201d (BOM)\n(see table 2 for details). In addition, historical\nlandings were compiled for the period from 1967\nto 2001 by various governmental organisations:\nthe Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics\n(IBGE, Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e\nEstat\u00edstica), the Research Centre for Northeastern\n\nFisheries (CEPENE, Centro de Pesquisa e\nExtens\u00e3o Pesqueira do Nordeste), and the\nSuperintendence for the Fishing Development\n(SUDEPE, Superintend\u00eancia para o\nDesenvolvimento da Pesca).\n\nData analysis\n\nThe relationship between depth and fish size\nwas assessed by correlation and regression\nanalyses. The correlation analysis was used to test\nthe statistical significance of the relationship for\neach species. The correlation between depth and\nsize was determined for all species using non-\nparametric Spearman\u2019s rank correlation\ncoefficient. The regression analysis was\nperformed using the Kendall's robust line-fit\nmethod (1995). Kendall's rank correlation was\nused in order to test whether the slope (?) for each\nspecies was different from zero.\n\nCatches were analysed by gear, which were\narranged amongst the following categories: line,\nnet and trap. Minimum, maximum and average\nvalues of fish size were analysed by gear in order\nto describe the gear effects on the life history of\nthe species. For each species, catches were also\nanalysed by sampled year and fleet category.\nCatch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was used as an\nindex of relative abundance. The catch was\ndefined in two different ways: (1) by using total\nweight (kg) caught by species and (2) by using\nnumber of individuals caught. Furthermore, in\norder to standardise the effort between gears, the\ntime (days) spent at sea for each trip was chosen as\nthe best estimate. In spite of the roughness of the\nunit of effort, catch and effort for each species\nwere positively correlated (Spearman\u2019s correlation\nr = 0.5, p &lt;0.001). The CPUE analysis was\ncarried out by species considering the following\ndepth strata: &lt;20m (inner shelf), 20 to 80m (outer\nshelf), and >80m (slope) (Mabesoone &amp; Coutinho,\n1970). The Kruskal and Wallis non-parametric\ntest was used to test the differences of the CPUE\nindex between depth strata as well as differences\nbetween fleet category. We also looked at CPUE\nversus depth strata relationship using Spearman\u2019s\nrank correlation analysis.\n\nSpecies Cear\u00e1\nRio Grande\n\ndo Norte\nPernambuco Alagoas Bahia Total\n\nL. analis 392 178 977 103 1320 2970\n\nL. chrysurus 2578 400 1092 93 5618 9781\n\nL. jocu 750 79 394 142 989 2354\n\nL. synagris 2271 534 1770 13 489 5077\n\nL. vivanus 130 252 183 42 1090 1697\n\nTotal 6121 1443 4416 393 9506 21879\n\n\n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \u2013 BABT in press\n\n4\n\nTable 2: Fleet category description.\n\nFleet type Code\nDepth range (m)\n\n25% - median - 75%\nDescription\n\nPaquete PQT 8 - 12 - 24\nSail, wood-made, flat shell without keel nor cabin\nSize<6m, no storing capacity\n\nJangada JAN 14 - 30 - 42\nSail, wood-made, flat shell without keel nor cabin\nstoring capacity (isotherm box)\n\nBote \u00e0 vela BOV 43 - 73.5 - 96\nSail, cabin, storing capacity size<15m\nstoring capacity, ice\n\nBote motorizado BOM 41 - 52.5 - 93\nMotorised, cabin, storing capacity size<15m\nstoring capacity, ice\n\nBote BOT 82 - 93 - 115\nSail and motor facilities, cabin, storing capacity size<15m\nstoring capacity, ice\n\nF\no\n\nrk\nle\n\nn\ng\n\nth\n(c\n\nm\n)\n\nLut analis\n\n40\n\n48\n\n56\n\n64\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nL. chrysurus\n\n30\n\n36\n\n42\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nL. jocu\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nL. synagris\n\n18\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nL. vivanus\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\n1997 1998 1999\n\nFigure 1: Mean size (cm) of each species exploited along the Northeastern coast during the studied\nperiod.

The\nrelationship between depth and fish size for the\nfive species was assessed using Spearman\u2019s rank\ncorrelation and Kendall\u2019s robust line-fit. All five\nspecies showed a positive and significant\ncorrelation between the fork length and the depth\n(Table 3).\n\nConsidering all gears pooled together, the fish\nsize caught ranged for snappers from 7.5 to 103.0\ncm FL. Mean fork length showed a decreasing\ntrend for L. synagris L. analis, L. vivanus (p<0.05)\nand for L. jocu (although non significant),\nconversely L. chrysurus showed a significant\n(p<0.05) increasing trend (Fig 1).\n\nLine fishery caught snappers from 7.5 to 99 cm\nFL, while nets caught individuals from 13 to 85\ncm FL and traps caught individuals from 16 to 103\ncm FL. Analysing the catch composition by\nspecies, every gear affected almost the entire size\nrange of the snapper populations, however traps\nwere found the most selective for L. chrysurus and\nL. vivanus (Fig 2). The fork length of snappers\ncaught by all the three gears increased according\nto depth until a maximum at 60 m (Table 4). The\noperating depth range was deeper for line and\nshallower for net and traps (Table 5a). Paired gear\ngroups were tested using the Mann-Whitney U\nprocedure. Line depth operation was significantly\ndifferent from Net and Trap (p<0.001), while no\ndifference could be distinguished between Net and\ntraps. Lines, nets and traps caught, in average,\nindividuals of similar size range for all species.\nFishermen using hook and line operated\npreferentially between 40 and 60 m. Users of net\noccurred rather equally through the depth gradient\nwith a peak between 0 and 20 m and, traps were\n\nset up preferentially within the 20-40 m (5b).\nLargest specimens of each species were caught at\ndeeper limits of the species range. As a general\npattern, small individuals were exclusive to\nshallow waters and larger ones to deeper waters;\nan intermediate zone presented a mixed sized\nfishes (Fig 3).\n\nCatch per unit of effort (CPUE) versus depth\nrelationship\n\nAlthough snappers have a wide range of\ndistribution, differences between species were\ndetected. The maximum relative abundance\n(numerical and biomass CPUE) of the Lutjanus\nspecies varied according to depth. L. synagris and\nL. vivanus were more abundant at the extremes of\nthe snappers distribution range: shallower and\ndeeper waters respectively. The three other\nspecies (L. analis, L. chrysurus, and L. jocu)\nshowed a smoother distribution with a maximum\nabundance reported in the 20 \u2013 80 m depth strata -\nouter shelf part (Table 6a and 6b). The\nrelationship between the numerical CPUE\n(individuals caught per day at sea) and the depth\nwas negatively correlated for L. synagris, L. jocu,\nL. chrysurus, and L. analis. L. vivanus presented a\nnon-significant positive relationship (Table 7a),\nwhile the relationship between the depth and the\nCPUE in kg per day at sea was negative for L.\nsynagris, positive for L. analis and L. vivanus, and\nnon significant for L. chrysurus and L. jocu (table\n7b).\n\nFleets mostly operated between 40 and 60 m\n(25% of the total number of trips)(Table 8), where\nthe major part of Lutjanids stocks are located,\naffecting mainly the adults of L. analis and L. jocu\n(> 30 cm FL) and, both juveniles (&lt;23 cm FL)\nand adults of L. chrysurus (Fig 3). The depth\nstratum 20-40 m concentrated 20% of trips, which\ninfluenced young adults (> 30 cm) of L. jocu, and\nboth juveniles and young adults of L. synagris and\nL. chrysurus.\n\n\n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \u2013 BABT in press\n\n6\n\nTable 3: Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficients (r) and slope (?) between depth and fish size.

Motorised boats operated mostly from\n20 m towards offshore (over 80 m deep) whilst\n\u201cjangadas\u201d fished from the coast up to 60 m deep.\nSailing boats (BOV) and mixed boats (BOT)\nrepresented 5% of the total number of trips with an\noperation range mostly above 80 m. \u201cPaquetes\u201d\n\n\n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \u2013 BABT in press\n\n8\n\nrepresented 15% of the total number of trips and\noperated mainly from the coast up to 20 m deep.\n\nThe snappers\u2019 catch composition (Table 9)\nshows that motorised boats (BOM) fished on the\nfive studied species. However, L. synagris, that\ninhabits shallower waters, was less affected by\nmotorised boats but it was the main target of the\nwind propelled \u201cpaquetes\u201d and \u201cjangadas\u201d.\nConversely, L. vivanus, which inhabits deeper\nwaters, was targeted almost exclusively by\nmotorised boats. The remaining species were\ncaught by all categories. As fishing activity was\ngreater at shallow (<20 m) and intermediate depth\n(40 to 60 m), where rudimental fleet and more\nadvanced technologically fleets overlap, fishery in\nNortheast of Brazil affects mainly species that\ninhabits preferably this depth layer (L. analis, L.\njocu and L. chrysurus).\n\nDifferences between relative abundance and\nfleet category were significant for all species when\nthe biomass CPUE was considered and for three\nspecies L. analis, L. jocu and L. synagris when\nnumerical CPUE was analysed (Table 10).\n\nThe \u201cjangadas\u201d (JAN) fleet category was the\nmost numerous fleet in activity along the\nnortheastern coast, from Cear\u00e1 to Alagoas (53% of\ntotal operating boats) (Table 11), followed by the\n\nmotorised boats category (BOM) with 22.4% of\nthe total fleet. However, although motorised boats\nwere less numerous, their fishing power was\ngreater than \u201cjangada\u2019s\u201d ones and, landings of\nmotorised boats (BOM) and \u201cjangadas\u201d equally\nrepresented 27% of the Lutjanus catches recorded\nby the Brazilian official statistics during the period\nfrom 1997 to 2001 (estatpesca). Motorised boats\n(BOM) and sailing boats (BOV) showed the\ngreater yield considering the biomass, CPUE and\nthe numerical CPUE. BOM yielded 13.7 and\nBOV 9.6 kg / days spent at sea whilst \u201cjangadas\u201d\nyielded 6.1 kg/ days (Table 12a and 12b).\n\nTrip duration, days spent at sea, was different\namongst fleet categories and states (Table 13).\nWhile small fleets, \u201cpaquetes\u201d and \u201cjangadas\u201d,\nspent at sea no more than two days, more\nsophisticated fleets trip duration (BOM, BOV)\ncould reach 12 days at sea. However it is recorded\ndifferences between states. \u201cJangadas\u201d from\nCear\u00e1 and Rio Grande do Norte spent, in average,\n2 days at sea whilst, in Pernambuco, trip was\nrestricted to a day. Motorised boats (BOM) time\nat sea ranged from 1 - 2 days in Bahia to 4 - 5 days\nin Pernambuco, Alagoas and Rio Grande do Norte.\nIn Cear\u00e1 trips of Motorised boats (BOM) may last\nup to 13 days .\n\nTable 11: Boats in activity, registered by the national fishery statistic program by state along the\nNortheastern coast during the studied period.

Also, in a fishery context, an\nincrease of the number of large specimen with\nincreasing depth is commonly observed (Roberts,\n1996). Our results indicated that significant body\nsize versus depth relationship has been observed\nfor each species. Bathymetric distribution\naccording to demersal fish size has been already\nreported (Lukens, 1981; MacPherson &amp; Duarte,\n1991). The relationships, examined in our study,\nshowed a general trend going towards a greater\nsize with increasing depth, such a result was also\nreported in various studies (Rooker, 1995;\nMachias et al., 1998; Rex &amp; Etter, 1998).\nHowever, the depth- body size relationship is\nweaker at intermediate depths due to a spatial\noverlap. Indeed, when small individuals are\nexclusive to shallow waters and only large ones\nare caught in deep waters, mixed catch of medium\nand large fishes is reported at intermediate depths.\nThis movement may be related to feeding, and\nreproductive habits (Uiblein, 1991; MacPherson,\n1998; St-John, 1999; Grutter, 2000; Carrasson &amp;\nMatallanas, 2001).\n\nOliveira (2000) reported that maximum relative\nabundance (CPUE) of teleosts species on the\nexternal part of the shelf and the slope was\nobserved within the depth strata of 100 \u2013 150 m.\nIn this study, the maximum abundance of four\nLutjanus species (L. vivanus did not present a\nsignificant pattern) was negatively correlated with\nthe increasing depth, when numerical CPUE was\nconsidered. However, the relationship changed\nwhen the biomass CPUE was considered.\nIndividuals were caught in greater number in\nshallow waters but as most of them were small\nsized fishes, the relationship between CPUE index,\nconsidering weight, and depth showed a mixed\npattern. Negative relationship of numerical CPUE\nwas counterbalanced by the bathymetric\ndistribution of lutjanids caught. Mean maximum\n\nrelative abundance varied, for each species, from\nthe shallow water layers with L. synagris to the\ndeep water layers with L. vivanus. Several\nexplanations have been offered to describe this\npattern, including differential mortality or growth\nwith depth or migration to deeper water with\nincreasing size (Roberts, 1996). Ecological\ncharacteristics of shallow and deep waters may be\nresponsible for such distribution. Shallow waters\nfeature shelters for younger fish, they, generally,\nhave a higher productivity and are inhabited by\nsmall preys that are also targeted by young, small\nsized fish. Alternatively, fishes that inhabit deep\ncool waters have their losses of energy reduced\n(Longhurst &amp; Pauly, 1987), which allows them to\nstore more energy so they are less susceptible to\nfluctuations in food supply (scarcer in deep\nwaters) (Sogard, 1997). The maximum length\nreported for the Lutjanus species (L. analis: 94 cm\nFL, L. chrysurus: 87 cm FL, L. jocu: 128 cm FL,\nL. synagris: 60 cm FL, L. vivanus: 83 cm FL)\n(Allen, 1985) is similar to the maximum length\nregistered for the Northeast Brazilian catches. For\nall species, juveniles were also caught. Hence, the\nthree main operating fishing gears (traps, lines and\ngill nets) affect almost the entire range of the life\nhistory of the Lutjanus species. However, gears\ncaught fishes of similar size for all species.\n\nIn a multispecific perspective, the fleet/gear\ncomes into contact with stocks of different species,\nand a mixed catch result due to the exploitation of\ntechnologically interdependent species (Anderson,\n1986). In such a context, the technological\ninteractions is not only related to the selection of\npart of the stock but also with the selection of the\nspecies caught. Considering the species\u2019\ndistribution and the multispecific nature of the reef\nfishery in Northeast Brazil, fleet operation may\nvary from shallow to deep waters depending,\namongst others factors (environmental conditions,\nmotorised or wind motioned boats, shelf width,\ntrade winds, etc), on the availability of a typical\ncoastal species (as L. synagris) or a typical deeper-\nwater species (as L. vivanus). Considering such\nstratified distribution, fleets with different\n\n\n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \u2013 BABT in press\n\n10\n\noperation capacities will affect stocks on different\nways.\n\nThese differences may not necessarily related\nto gear (a boat in tropical fishery may carry more\nthan one gear) but also to the fleet power, which is\nrelated to fleet category, and also to the state, due\nto its environmental characteristics. Fishing\ngrounds, i.e. shallow or deep waters, will be\nreached according to fleet power. Factors as\nengine power, carrying capacity, presence or\nabsence of ice are related to the distance to the\nshore and hence, the time at sea. Additionally,\nenvironmental conditions such as wind, rain,\ncurrents, or the continental shelf width may\ninfluence the access to shallow or deep fishing\ngrounds.\n\nOur results highlighted the fact that\ntechnological interactions, will affect the catch\ncomposition and therefore the fishing impact on\nsnappers. All fleets categories mostly operated\nwithin the 40-60 m depth zone, what consequently\naffected mostly L. analis, L. jocu and L. chrysurus.\nMotorised boats (BOM) affected mainly L.\nvivanus because of its deeper waters fleet\noperation. \u201cJangadas\u201d and \u201cpaquetes\u201d had as their\nmain target L. synagris since they operate in\nshallower waters.\n\nAlso, climatic, oceanographic or geographic\ncharacteristics as winds, currents or\ngeomorphology of the shelf may influence the\nfleet operation and catch composition. For\nexample, wind powered boats, \u201cpaquetes\u201d,\n\u201cjangadas\u201d, sailing boats (BOV), in Cear\u00e1 had a\ngreater operating range, and therefore affect a\ngreater number of species, due to the dominant\nwinds (Trade winds) that allow the vessel to reach\ndeeper waters.\n\nFleets are likely to exploit different stages of\nthe life cycle of a fish community while operating\nin different geographical areas, in simultaneous or\nsequential harvesting (Charles &amp; Reed, 1985).\nFisheries of the same fish community are linked\nthrough their exploitation. To maintain the\nsustainability of the stock and to guarantee the\ncontinuance of the resource, the optimal fleet mix\nand catch allocation should be carefully\nconsidered (Kulbicki et al., 2000; Labrosse et al.,\n2000; Letourneur et al., 2000; Lucena et al.,\n2002).\n\nThe multifleet and multispecies nature of the\nnortheastern Brazilian fisheries has various\nconsequences in terms of resources management\nand ecological issues. In the study area, few\n\nmarine protected areas (MPA) have been created\nalong the coast as a part of a new management\nalternative of reef ecosystems (Ferreira, 2000).\nSome marine protected areas have been set parallel\nnearby the coast, mainly because of logistical\nreasons, i.e. zone easily accessible and that can be\nwatched from the shore. This setting would only\npreserve part of the life cycle of some species,\nexcluding other species. Due to the within and\nbetween fish species spatial structure, the MPA\ndesign will have consequences on its efficiency\n(Kramer &amp; Chapman, 1999). In small reserves\nnear the shore, snappers\u2019 home range will exceed\nthe MPA limits. Considering the reef fishery in\nNortheast Brazil, the MPA might be most efficient\nif set in direction to the off-shore in a attempt to\nprotect the entire range of fish distribution and\nconsequently the entire life cycle of the species.\nThis could also offer some protection of various\nkind of habitats used by different stage of the life-\ncycle of each species.\n\nAlthough we are aware that a dataset originated\nfrom commercial fisheries may only partially\nrepresent the fish community because of gear\nselectivity and fishing tactics, we may consider\nthat variations in the effort and/or gear fishing\npower represent the actual trend in the fish\ndistribution (fishermen go where the fish is).\nMore attention should be given on technological\ninteractions and multispecies aspects of the reef\nfishery in Northeast Brazil as stock assessment\nmodels for the management of single species\nfished by one type of gear (or fleet) may be\ninadequate to apply to the northeastern Brazilian\nfisheries and to predict changes at the assemblage\nlevel (Pikitch, 1988; Hilborn &amp; Walters, 1992).\nThe inter and intra-specific bathymetric\ndistribution and the multifleet character of the\nNortheastern Brazilian reef fishery demonstrate\nthat considering only one category of a fleet will\nlikely bias our assessment on the real impact of\nfishing activities.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT - This research\nis part of the \u2018Programa Nacional de Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do\nPotencial Sustent\u00e1vel dos Recursos vivos da Zona\nEcon\u00f4mica Exclusiva- REVIZEE\u2019 funded by the\nMinist\u00e9rio do Meio Ambiente \u2013 MMA and the\nSecretaria da Comiss\u00e3o Interministerial para os\nRecursos do Mar \u2013 SECIRM.

Catches of\n\nsnappers (Lutjanidae) were dominated by the pargo Lutjanus purpureus Poey,\n\nduring the 60\u00b4s.  Nowadays, 12 species of the genera Lutjanus are exploited by\n\ndemersal fisheries in the North-eastern coast.  Landing records aggregate species\n\nin multiespecific categories, as with the \u201cpargo\u201d category, composed by five\n\ndifferent species.  Until the 70\u00b4s, this category was the most important for most\n\nstates, with the exception of Bahia state.  In Pernambuco state the mutton snapper\n\nor \u201ccioba\u201d, Lutjanus analis (Cuvier) became the most representative species in the\n\n80\u00b4s, followed by the yellowtail snapper or \u201cguai\u00faba\u201d, L. chrysurus (Bloch), the dog\n\nsnapper or \u201cdent\u00e3o\u201d, L. jocu, (Blocch &amp; Schneider) and the lane snapper or\n\n\u201cariac\u00f3\u201d, L. synagris (Linnaeus).  In the Rio Grande do Norte state \u201cguai\u00faba\u201d\n\nlandings increased in the 80\u00b4s and nowadays the four species (L. chrysurus, L.\n\njocu, L. synagris\u201d, L. analis) are equally represented.  In Cear\u00e1 state, where pargo\n\n\n\nBol. T\u00e9cn. Cient. CEPENE, v11, n.1, 2003.\n\n3\n\nlandings remained higher for a longer period, \u201cguai\u00faba\u201d and \u201cariac\u00f3\u201d landings have\n\nalso increased in the last decades. According with the results of the REVIZEE/NE\n\nprogram, the age and growth parameters for these species indicate slow growth\n\nand (K<0,2) and medium to high longevity (20 to 30 years). These characteristics\n\nmake these species vulnerable to over fishing, what indicates the need to develop\n\nfisheries management programs for the group.\n\nKey words: Fisheries, Lutjanids, North-eastern Brazilian Coast.\n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O\n\nA fam\u00edlia Lutjanidae, pertence \u00e0 ordem Perciforme, a mais\n\ndiversificada entre todas as ordens de peixes e tamb\u00e9m a ordem com maior\n\nn\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies entre os vertebrados (Nelson, 1997).  Esta fam\u00edlia \u00e9\n\nconsiderada como importante recurso pesqueiro em toda sua \u00e1rea de ocorr\u00eancia\n\n(Fischer, 1978; Ralston &amp; Myamotu 1983; Polovina &amp; Ralston, 1987; Ralston &amp;\n\nWilliams 1989; Morales-Nin &amp; Ralston, 1990; Haitght et al., 1993; Roberts &amp;\n\nPolunin, 1996).\n\nA explora\u00e7\u00e3o comercial dos Lutjan\u00eddeos na costa ocidental do oceano\n\nAtl\u00e2ntico teve in\u00edcio em 1800 na Am\u00e9rica Central (insular e continental) e sul dos\n\nEUA.

No caso espec\u00edfico do pargo, a\n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o come\u00e7ou a declinar a partir de 1979 e em 1982 j\u00e1 mostrava ind\u00edcios de\n\nsobrepesca, com diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do comprimento m\u00e9dio e aumento da participa\u00e7\u00e3o do\n\nestoque jovem nas capturas (Ivo &amp; Hanson, 1982; Ximenes &amp; Fonteles-Filho\n\n1988).\n\nNo Cear\u00e1 e Rio Grande do Norte a categoria \u201cpargo\u201d mostrou-se sempre\n\ncomo um o recurso pesqueiro importante ao longo de todo o per\u00edodo analisado,\n\ncom altas produ\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 1990. A partir deste ano as capturas passaram a\n\ndecrescer at\u00e9 o ano de 1990 (Figura 1).\n\nNo caso do Cear\u00e1, a pesca do pargo mostrou aumento cont\u00ednuo da\n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o desde a d\u00e9cada de 70 at\u00e9 1981, quando atingiu 6.617 t. A partir de\n\n1977 pode-se observar a participa\u00e7\u00e3o de outras esp\u00e9cies nas capturas como o\n\ndent\u00e3o, Lutjnaus jocu, a guai\u00faba, L. chrysurus, a cioba, L analis e o ariac\u00f3, L.\n\nsynagris.  A partir de 1981 se observa uma mudan\u00e7a na composi\u00e7\u00e3o dos\n\ndesembarques no estado do Cear\u00e1; e, ao mesmo tempo em que ocorre uma\n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o nos \u00edndices de produtividade do \u201cpargo\u201d, as demais esp\u00e9cies adquirem\n\nmaior import\u00e2ncia nos desembarques.  As esp\u00e9cies mais representativas nas\n\ncapturas de 2001, no estado do Cear\u00e1, foram guai\u00faba, com 1.346 t, pargo, com\n\n926 t, ariac\u00f3, com 618 t, cioba, com 118 t, e dent\u00e3o, com 79,4 t (Figura 1).\n\nO pargo continua como o segundo recurso mais importante no estado do\n\nCear\u00e1, mas as estat\u00edsticas provavelmente incluem capturas desta esp\u00e9cie\n\nefetuadas pela frota nordestina que se concentra e opera na regi\u00e3o Norte, na\n\nplataforma continental dos estados do Par\u00e1 e Amap\u00e1 (Souza, 2000).\n\nNo estado do Rio Grande do Norte, durante o per\u00edodo de 1967 a 1979, a\n\ncategoria \u201cpargo\u201d foi dominante nas capturas, embora n\u00e3o tenha apresentado um\n\npadr\u00e3o de aumento continuado como no caso do Cear\u00e1. A maior captura\n\nregistrada foi no ano de 1977, com 701 t. A partir deste ano at\u00e9 1989 as capturas\n\nde pargo foram reduzidas e n\u00e3o ultrapassaram 100 t nos \u00faltimos sete anos, com a\n\ncategoria pargo contribuindo com 65,.5 t em 2001 (Figura 1).\n\nNo per\u00edodo entre 1967 e 1977, as capturas de cioba foram t\u00e3o expressivas\n\nno estado do Rio Grande do Norte quanto \u00e0s do pargo, embora tenham\n\napresentado oscila\u00e7\u00f5es para maior nos anos de 1972, 1974 e 1975. Em 1976,\n\n\n\nBol. T\u00e9cn. Cient.

A partir\n\nde 1978 a guai\u00faba passa a ser registrada nas capturas do estado do Rio Grande\n\ndo Norte e desde ent\u00e3o tem sido a esp\u00e9cie com maior produ\u00e7\u00e3o. Nos \u00faltimos sete\n\nanos tem sido registradas as capturas da cioba, do ariac\u00f3 e do dent\u00e3o, cujas\n\nprodu\u00e7\u00f5es para o ano de 2001 foram, respectivamente, 300,1 t, 163,7 t, 176,0 t e\n\n32,3 t (Figura 1).\n\nO volume de captura anual do \u201cpargo\u201d no estado de Pernambuco nos\n\n\u00faltimos 30 anos n\u00e3o chegou a ultrapassar 1.000 t, como ocorreu nos anos de\n\n1967 e 1968, quando a categoria \u201cpargo\u201d contribuiu isoladamente com 1.500 e\n\n3.500 t, respectivamente. Ao contr\u00e1rio, o desembarque desse grupo atingiu penas\n\n4,0 t em 2001. Entre 1972 e 1978 ainda ocorreram capturas de pargo como grupo\n\ndominante, mas n\u00e3o ultrapassando as 500 t, o que representa apenas 50% do\n\nvalor obtido quando da introdu\u00e7\u00e3o da pesca de linha de fundo no Brasil (Figura 1).\n\nA partir da d\u00e9cada de 80 a categoria pargo, no estado de Pernambuco, j\u00e1\n\nestava comercialmente extinta. A participa\u00e7\u00e3o dos outros estoques nas capturas\n\ncome\u00e7ou em 1978; quando foram registradas as seguintes produ\u00e7\u00f5es por\n\ncategoria: \u201cariac\u00f3 (149,0 t), \u201ccioba\u201d (110,7 t), \u201cguai\u00faba\u201d (37.1 t) e \u201cdent\u00e3o\u201d (9,5 t).\n\nO estado da Bahia, por outro lado, mostra um aumento continuado das\n\ncapturas de Lutjan\u00eddeos ao longo desta s\u00e9rie hist\u00f3rica, sendo que a categoria\n\nmais importante de 1969 a 1977 foi a \u201ccioba\u201d que, neste \u00faltimo ano alcan\u00e7ou 780\n\nt.

O decl\u00ednio da pesca do pargo\n\nnos bancos oce\u00e2nicos levou a frota a se deslocar para \u00e1reas de plataforma e\n\ntalude continental no final da d\u00e9cada de 70 e hoje a frota atua em duas \u00e1reas de\n\npesca diferentes ao largo da costa dos estados do Par\u00e1 e Amap\u00e1, com uma\n\nampla variedade de artes de pesca como linha pargueira com bicicleta, ca\u00edque,\n\ncovo, espinhel \u201clong-line\u201d e rede.  Dois estoques pertencentes a uma mesma\n\npopula\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o explorados, sendo que um destes apresenta poucos indiv\u00edduos em\n\nest\u00e1gio final de matura\u00e7\u00e3o, indicando a exist\u00eancia de \u00e1reas de desova diferentes\n\ndas \u00e1reas de pesca (Souza, 2000; Salles, 2000).  Desde ent\u00e3o, outras esp\u00e9cies\n\nque n\u00e3o ocorrem nos bancos e ilhas oce\u00e2nicas, como Lutjanus analis, L.\n\nchrysurus e L synagris passaram a ser registradas pelas estat\u00edsticas oficiais, mas\n\nprovavelmente j\u00e1 eram exploradas anteriormente por uma frota essencialmente\n\nartesanal.  Segundo Silva (1970), na composi\u00e7\u00e3o espec\u00edfica dos desembarques\n\nda frota de jangadas amostrada em seu estudo, na localidade do Pina em Recife-\n\nPE, os Lutjan\u00eddeos foram agrupados na categoria denominada Cioba e afins.\n\nAparentemente, estoques de pargo L. purpureus concentram-se em \u00e1reas\n\nespec\u00edficas, como bancos oce\u00e2nicos e pontos de quebra da plataforma\n\ncontinental (Fonteles-Filho &amp; Ferreira 1987), sustentando assim maiores capturas\n\npor\u00e9m por um intervalo de tempo menor. Estoques concentrados em fei\u00e7\u00f5es\n\ntopogr\u00e1ficas restritas, como em montanhas oce\u00e2nicas, tendem ao colapso r\u00e1pido,\n\ngeralmente ap\u00f3s 10 anos de pescarias (Koslow et al., 2000).\n\nO cen\u00e1rio da pesca dos Lutjan\u00eddeos para os estados do Nordeste indica\n\numa tend\u00eancia decrescente, mas as atuais an\u00e1lises s\u00e3o limitadas pela qualidade\n\ne confiabilidade das estat\u00edsticas oficiais consideradas.\n\n\n\nBol.

Al\u00e9m disso, a\n\npublica\u00e7\u00e3o de dados repetidos nos anos de 1990 a 1995 e a diferen\u00e7as na\n\nmetodologia aplicada pela BAHIAPESCA e o ESTATPESCA interromperam a\n\nseq\u00fc\u00eancia hist\u00f3rica al\u00e9m de impossibilitar compara\u00e7\u00f5es entre regi\u00f5es ou estados.\n\nOutro problema \u00e9 o fato de que os dados s\u00e3o relativos apenas \u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o, o que\n\nlimita as observa\u00e7\u00f5es das tend\u00eancias da pesca que devem ter incorporado\n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es significativas do esfor\u00e7o de pesca no per\u00edodo analisado (Rezende &amp;\n\nFerreira, 2000).\n\nEm praticamente todo o per\u00edodo analisado, o estado do Cear\u00e1 foi o que\n\napresentou as maiores capturas de Lutjan\u00eddeos.  Nos estados de Pernambuco e\n\nRio Grande do Norte esses recursos pesqueiros encontram-se praticamente\n\ncomercialmente extintos, o que passa a exigir a tomada de um elenco de a\u00e7\u00f5es\n\ncorretivas.  O estado que apresenta uma situa\u00e7\u00e3o aparentemente otimista \u00e9 a\n\nBahia, embora as capturas se concentrem na guai\u00faba e ariac\u00f3.\n\nEntre os diferentes recursos pesqueiros discriminados pelas estat\u00edsticas\n\npesqueiras para a regi\u00e3o Nordeste, no per\u00edodo analisado, apenas as lagostas e\n\npargo t\u00eam sido inseridos em Grupos Permanentes de Estudo (GPE), gerando\n\ndesta forma informa\u00e7\u00f5es mais detalhadas sobre produ\u00e7\u00e3o, esfor\u00e7o de pesca e\n\ncaptura por unidade de esfor\u00e7o (CPUE).  Adotado desde a d\u00e9cada de 70, o GPE\n\ndo pargo tem-se dedicado a definir e executar o regulamento da pesca desta\n\nesp\u00e9cie atrav\u00e9s do estabelecimento de um tamanho m\u00ednimo de captura em\n\nfun\u00e7\u00e3o da maturidade sexual.\n\nInd\u00edcios de sobrepesca sobre o comprimento m\u00e9dio populacional e sobre o\n\ntamanho de primeira reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o j\u00e1 foram relatados para o \u201cpargo\u201d.\n\nA participa\u00e7\u00e3o de cinco esp\u00e9cies diferentes nas capturas da categoria\n\n\u201cpargo\u201d, sem o registro oficial para estas esp\u00e9cies separadamente, impossibilita\n\nquaisquer avalia\u00e7\u00f5es de estoque mais confi\u00e1veis.

Resultados de estudos sobre idade, crescimento e\n\nmortalidade das cinco esp\u00e9cies de Lutjan\u00eddeos mais importantes na Zona\n\nEcon\u00f4mica Exclusiva da costa nordeste do Brasil confirmam as caracter\u00edsticas\n\ncitadas para as esp\u00e9cies destes g\u00eaneros (Programa REVIZEE/NE, 2003).\n\nConcluindo, a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de um grupo espec\u00edfico de estudos e uma pol\u00edtica de\n\nobten\u00e7\u00e3o de estat\u00edsticas pesqueiras de qualidade s\u00e3o medidas altamente\n\nrecomend\u00e1veis como forma de garantir o uso sustent\u00e1vel dos recursos\n\npesqueiros da regi\u00e3o Nordeste do Brasil.\n\nBIBLIOGRAFIA CONSULTADA\n\nALEGRIA Jr., C.; Menezes, M.F.
