Finance professionals who manage the company\u2019s capital budgeting \n\nprocesses will face challenges.  Specific characteristics of these projects as commodity-linked \n\nprices (e.g., the case of oil and gas and agricultural projects) and the customary uncertainties \n\nrelated to emerging markets are additional challenges. In this scenario, a more sophisticated \n\ncapital budgeting framework, Real Options, offers a more robust theory to deal with \n\nuncertainty, managerial flexibility, and volatile outcomes imbedded in these opportunities.  \n\nReal Options theory assumes that the managers\u2019 involvement in the project generates value so \n\nthey might capitalize on good outcomes or reduce losses by abandoning projects with bad \n\nresults. \n\nThe primary objective of this research was to apply Real Options valuation analysis for an \n\ninvestment project valuation and discuss the process and the results of such methodology.  \n\nThe case study retroactively analyzed an investment project in Colombia and compared the \n\nresults under traditional NPV methodology and Real Options.  The valuation techniques were \n\nperformed as if they had been applied at the time the project was approved and then compared \n\nwith the project's actual performance.  The case study evaluated two types of real options: \n\nfirst, the effect of an option to cancel a contract that is assessed from the perspective of the \n\nclient; and second, the option to abandon and defer from the perspective of the company that \n\nwill perform the investment. \n\nKeywords: real options, capital budget projects, decision under uncertainty, NPV, option to \n\ncancel. \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\nBrasil e outros mercados emergentes continuar\u00e3o a apresentar muitas oportunidades de \n\ninvestimento nos pr\u00f3ximos anos. Profissionais financeiros que gerenciam os processos de \n\nor\u00e7amento de capital nas empresas ter\u00e3o grandes desafios a enfrentar. Caracter\u00edsticas \n\nespec\u00edficas destes projetos como pre\u00e7os ligados a commodities (por exemplo: petr\u00f3leo e g\u00e1s e \n\nprojetos agr\u00edcolas) e as incertezas habituais relacionadas com os mercados emergentes s\u00e3o \n\ndesafios adicionais. Neste cen\u00e1rio, ferramentas mais sofisticadas de or\u00e7amento de capital \n\ncomo Op\u00e7\u00f5es Reais, oferece uma teoria mais robusta para lidar com incerteza, flexibilidade \n\ngerencial, e os resultados vol\u00e1teis embutidas nestas oportunidades. A teoria de Op\u00e7\u00f5es Reais \n\nassume que o envolvimento dos gestores nos projetos gera valor \u00e0 medida que potencializam \n\nos bons resultados ou reduzem as perdas por abandonar projetos com maus resultados. \n\nO objetivo principal desta pesquisa foi aplicar a an\u00e1lise de Op\u00e7\u00f5es Reais para um projeto de \n\ninvestimento e discutir o processo e os resultados da metodologia. O estudo de caso analisa \n\nretroativamente um projeto de investimento na Col\u00f4mbia e compara os resultados sob o \n\ntradicional VPL e Op\u00e7\u00f5es Reais. As t\u00e9cnicas de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o foram realizadas como se \n\nestivessem sendo aplicadas no momento em que o projeto foi aprovado, e depois comparadas \n\ncom o desempenho real do projeto. O estudo de caso avaliado possui dois tipos de Op\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nReais: primeiro, o efeito de uma op\u00e7\u00e3o para cancelar um contrato que \u00e9 analisado a partir da \n\nperspectiva do cliente que pode exercer essa op\u00e7\u00e3o, e o segundo, a op\u00e7\u00e3o de abandonar e adiar \n\na partir da perspectiva da empresa que ir\u00e1 executar a investimento. \n\nPalavras-chave: op\u00e7\u00f5es reais, projetos de or\u00e7amento de capital, decis\u00e3o sob incerteza, VPL, \n\nop\u00e7\u00e3o de cancelar. \n\n  \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nI would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Professor Arthur Ridolfo Neto, for \n\nhis outstanding insight and generous encouragement.

The giant national oil company (NOC) \n\nPetrobras announced aggressive investment plans (U.S. $213.5 billion from 2011 to 2015) \n\nthat will position Brazil as the 5th largest oil producer in the world. Petrobras projects, as well \n\nas several other infrastructure projects spurred by the 2014 World Cup soccer championship, \n\nthe 2016 Olympics Games, and the internal market boom, all of which will present several \n\ninvestment opportunities for local and international companies. \n\nThese opportunities will require significant capital expenditure for several years.  This will be \n\nchallenging for finance professionals who manage the company\u2019s capital budgeting processes.  \n\nThe specific characteristics of commodity-linked prices (in the case of oil and gas and \n\nagricultural projects) and the traditional uncertainties about emerging markets add additional \n\nspice to the context.  In this scenario, a more sophisticated capital budget framework, Real \n\nOptions, presents a more robust framework for dealing with the uncertainty, managerial \n\nflexibility, and volatile outcomes imbedded in those investment opportunities.  \n\nThe Real Options methodology represents a very comprehensive approach to evaluating those \n\nopportunities.  It not only values the options imbedded in the investment decisions \n\ncompressively than the traditional Net Present Value (NPV) analysis does, but also improves \n\nthe planning and formulation of those projects.  Unlike NPV, Real Options theory assumes \n\nthat the managers\u2019 involvement in the project generates value since they might capitalize on \n\ngood outcomes or reduce loss by abandoning projects with bad results. \n\nAccording to Trigeorgis (1993), an options approach to capital budgeting has the potential to \n\nconceptualize and even quantify the value of options from active management.  This value \n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\nmanifests as a collection of real (call or put) options embedded in capital investment \n\nopportunities that have as an underlying asset the gross project value of expected operating \n\ncash flows.  Many of these Real Options occur naturally (e.g., to defer, contract, shut down, or \n\nabandon), while others may be planned and built in at extra cost (e.g., to expand capacity or \n\nbuild growth options, to default when investment is staged sequentially, or to switch between \n\nalterative inputs or outputs).   \n\nManagers have always been aware of Real Options, although perhaps not by this name. They \n\nalways had the option to abandon a bad investment or stage the investment in a new plant \n\naccording to demand growth, so those concepts are not new.  Experienced managers have \n\nalways understood the \u201coptions\u201d concept intuitively.  Still, a more systemic and structural \n\napproach to deal with those concepts in conjunction with the investment decision process adds \n\nvalue to the decision by quantifying it and providing a framework to analyze it.  Real Options \n\ndecision analysis techniques provide managers with more intuition and information for \n\nsolutions to valuation problems.  This is critical in an increasingly competitive business \n\nenvironment in which the ability to accurately assess project and asset values, including the \n\nincremental value related to a project's embedded options, will heavily influence difficult \n\ninvestment portfolio decisions (Hahn; Brandao; Dyer, 2010).   \n\n \n\n1.2 Research Purpose \n\nThe primary aim of this research study is to understand the practical use of Real Options \n\nvaluation analysis and the tradeoff between the complexity (costs) of using it and the benefits \n\nof improving the analysis' explanatory power for decision-makers. The focus of the analysis \n\nwas an investment opportunity in an oil and gas field services company in Latin America. The \n\ninvestment opportunity was examined using a case study methodology that retroactively \n\nanalyzed the project and compared the project results under traditional methodologies (NPV) \n\nand Real Options. The valuation technique was performed as if it had been applied at the time \n\nthe project was approved and subsequently compared with the project's actual performance. \n\nAs a secondary objective, this study discusses the insights and options embedded in this \n\ninvestment opportunity.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\n2  MAIN CONCEPTS INVOLVED \n \n\n2.1 Description of Onshore Drilling Services \n\nA common Oil Field Services (OFS) company offers its drilling services for oil and gas \n\noperators that will manage the field after the wells are operational. The operators are typically \n\nNOCs (National Oil Companies) or private multinational companies that have the legal right \n\nto explore the field. OFS companies typically charge operators for rig services on a day rate \n\nbasis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required, market \n\nconditions in the region in which the rig operates, the ancillary equipment provided on the rig \n\nand the necessary personnel. The total revenues for the services are generated by multiplying \n\nthe rate for the service by the time consumed in using it. The efficiency of the rig and the day \n\nrate are the most important drivers for rig profitability. \n\nA general drilling rig contract can require a full range of land-based drilling services, \n\nincluding: drilling initial wells, opening new production zones in existing wells, re-\n\ncompleting wells in which production has declined, drilling out plugs, and converting \n\nproducing wells to injection wells during enhanced recovery operations as well as mechanical \n\nrepairs necessary to maintain or improve production from the well. \n\n2.2 Risks involved on the Drilling Services Operations \n\nThere are several characteristics and risks associated with a drilling operation (from the OFS \n\ncompany perspective) that could substantially affect the cash flow of an operation that are not \n\nalways incorporated in the capital budget decision for new investments. The main risks for a \n\ntypical operation (contract) such as the one in the case study are: \n\n? Need to make significant upfront working capital commitments (labor and \n\ntransportation costs) prior to receiving payments; \n\n? Some of the risk associated with the drilling operations, which are generally assumed \n\nby the operator of the well, including machinery breakdowns and abnormal drilling \n\nconditions. Accordingly, if severe drilling problems are encountered in drilling wells \n\nunder such contracts, the client could suffer substantial losses, which may have an \n\nadverse effect on the OFS company. \n\n? The OFS company (the contractor) may be adversely affected if customers seek to \n\ncancel or renegotiate the drilling contract during periods of depressed market \n\nconditions or if the company experiences downtime or operational difficulties. During \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\ndepressed market conditions, a customer may no longer need a rig that is currently \n\nunder contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a lower day rate. \n\n? In a general contract, operators may have the right to terminate existing contracts if the \n\ncompany experiences downtime or operational problems above the contractual limit; \n\ncertain contracts include terms allowing customers to terminate contracts without \n\ncause, with little or no prior notice and without penalty or early termination fees.  \n\n? Historically, the industry has been highly cyclical, with periods of high demand, short \n\nrig supply and high day rates often followed by periods of low demand, excess rig \n\nsupply and low day rates.  Periods of low demand and excess rig supply intensify the \n\ncompetition in the industry and often result in rigs being idle for long periods.  \n\n? Social, political, labor and economic conditions in Latin America may cause volatility \n\nin the operations, manifesting as strikes, roads obstructions, shortage of equipment \n\nreplacements (due to importation constrains), environmental permit delays, and \n\nforeign exchange controls. \n\n2.3 Drilling Market Dynamics \n\nThe onshore drilling market has similar dynamics of the more sophisticated and lager offshore \n\nmarket, however it is more local and more affected by regional circumstances. As described \n\nin the Harvard Business School case the Offshore Drilling Indutry (Corts, 1999) the drilling \n\nindustry is very cyclical and strongly correlated to the Oil Prices, for example: The second oil \n\ncrises sent oil prices from under $ 10 to over $30 in 1979 boosting the exploration. Capacity \n\nutilization for rigs climbed to 100% and rental rates paid to contractors nearly doubled. As \n\nutilization soared, new rigs were ordered and built, with new contractors and private groups \n\nentering the industry. With newly completed rigs continuing to swell rig supply, utilization \n\nrates fell below 80% on 1983, and day rates fell more than half, despite persistence of oil \n\nprices in the high $20s. \n\nThe similar dynamics affected the Colombian onshore drilling industry; however, as a local \n\nmarket other aspects also influenced the growth and declines of the market. In the 2000s \n\nColombian government launched several efforts to build and developed its oil industry \n\nbringing significant amounts of foreign investments to its industry as it leased new promising \n\nexploration areas. These efforts also boosted the Oil field Service industry. The number of \n\nonshore drilling and workover (maintenance services rigs) rigs in the country grew from 80 \n\nrigs in 1999 to 274 in 2012. The Colombian Market is considered a very competitive and open \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nmarket. In this environment of strong competition and abrupt responses to utilization as the \n\nmarket changes, the right to cancel rental contracts that the Oil Field Industry (contractors) \n\naward to the Operators could be very valuable to operators in the downturns and most of \n\ntimes neglected by the OFS industry. This case will further discuss and value such real option. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n3  LITERATURE REVIEW \n\n3.1 Capital Budgeting \n\nCompanies make capital investments to create and exploit profit opportunities that generate \n\nvalue for the organization when those projects are mature and well implemented.  The \n\nanalysis, approval, and control of capital investment projects are the main purposes of a well-\n\ndefined capital budgeting process.  Investment proposals may emerge from different parts of \n\nthe organization, so companies need procedures to ensure that every project is assessed \n\nconsistently. When managers are presented with a black and white Excel spreadsheet \n\ncontaining a discounted cash flow analysis, they should not take it at face value.  Instead, they \n\nshould ask for more \u201ccolor\u201d (contextualization) in the numbers and understand the context of \n\nthe proposal, the strategic consideration of the project, what makes it \u201ctick\u201d, the options \n\ninvolved in it, and the possible pitfalls of its assumptions.  Once one understands those \n\nimplications, one might want to reconfigure the project to improve its chances of success \n\n(Myers, Stewart et al., 2011).  In proper capital budgeting analysis, managers should look for \n\nways to capitalize on success and reduce the cost of failure.  The company also should \n\nconsider the value of the right to modify the project as the future unfolds.  This is the main \n\npillar of Real Options theory as applied to capital budgeting.   \n\n \n\n3.2 Financial Options  \n\nA financial option is a derivative instrument that specifies a contract between two parties for a \n\nfuture transaction of an asset at a reference price (the strike price). The buyer of the option \n\ngains the right, but not the obligation, to engage in that transaction, while the seller incurs the \n\ncorresponding obligation to fulfill the transaction. The price of an option is derived from the \n\ndifference between the reference price and the value of the underlying asset (commonly a \n\nstock, a bond, currency or a futures contract) plus a premium based on the time remaining \n\nuntil the expiration of the option. An option that conveys the right to buy something at a \n\nspecific price is referred as a call; an option that conveys the right to sell something at a \n\nspecific price is called a put. If the option is not exercised by the expiration date, it becomes \n\nworthless. In return for assuming the obligation, or writing the option, the originator of the \n\noption collects a payment, the premium, from the buyer. The writer of an option must make \n\ngood on delivering (or receiving) the underlying asset or its cash equivalent if the option is \n\nexercised. Its original buyer can usually sell the financial option to another party. Many \n\noptions are created in standardized form and traded through an anonymous options exchange, \n\nwhile other over-the-counter options are customized to the desires of the buyer, usually by an \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\ninvestment bank. The most common type of standardized financial options are: the European \n\noption\u2014an option that may only be exercised on expiration; and the American option, an \n\noption that may be exercised on any trading day on or before expiration. \n\nA financial option is itself an asset that derives its value from (1) the underlying asset\u2019s value, \n\nwhich can fluctuate dramatically prior to the date on which the opportunity to purchase or sell \n\nthe underlying asset expires, and (2) the decisions made by the investor to exercise or hold the \n\noption. Option\u2019s pricing methods have been developed to estimate option values from \n\nparameters characterizing the underlying asset\u2019s value and investor behavior (Cobb; Charnes, \n\n2009). \n\nThe payoff from a long position in a European call option is expressed as the following: \n\nVT = max[ST \u2013X, 0], where T is the expiration date, X is the strike price, and ST is the final \n\nprice of the underlying asset. The decision rule is that the option will be exercised if ST  X \n\nand not be exercised if ST<X.  \n\nThe payoff to the holder of a long position in a European put option is expressed as the \n\nfollowing: \n\nVT = max[X \u2013ST, 0]. The decision rule is that the option will be exercised if ST   X and not to \n\nbe exercised if ST >X (Jiao, Y.-Y. et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n3.3 Origins and Building Blocks of Real Options \n\nThe Real Options revolution arose in part as a response to the dissatisfaction experienced by \n\ncorporate practitioners, strategists, and some academics with traditional capital budgeting \n\ntechniques.  Well before the development of Real Options, corporate managers and strategists \n\nwere grappling intuitively with the elusive elements of managerial operating flexibility and \n\nstrategic interactions (Trigeorgis, 1993). \n\nMyers (1977) first coined the term \u201cReal Options,\u201d recognizing that particular growth \n\nopportunities could be addressed as call options and their value would depend on optional \n\nfuture investments.  Later, Ross (1978) discussed a valuation approach for Real Options.  \n\nTrigeorgis (1993) organized and discussed the several Real Options categories according to \n\ntheir flexibilities.  Many of the Real Options theories were developed based on these seminal \n\nworks.  Afterwards, several articles, such as Dixit &amp; Pindyck (1995), began advocating the \n\nuse of Real Options as a substitute for static NPV analysis and its pitfalls. \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nAccording to Trigeorgis' (1993) literature review and categorization, it is possible to analyze \n\nthe application approach in two subgroups that are not mutually exclusive and differ from \n\neach other by the lenses used to read the situation and approach the problem, not necessarily \n\nby the framework applied.  According to Trigeorgis (1993), the most common Real Options \n\ngeneric applications are: \n\n? Option to defer: Management holds an agreement on (or an option to buy) valuable \n\nland or resources.  It can wait to see if output prices justify constructing a building or \n\nplant or developing a field.  This option is usually applicable in real estate \n\ndevelopment and commodities exploration (oil, farming, and mining); \n\n? Time to build option (staged investment): Staging investment as a series of outlays \n\ncreates the option to abandon the enterprise midstream if new information is \n\nunfavorable.  Each stage can be viewed as an option of the value of subsequent stages \n\nand can be valued as a compound option.  This approach can be used in R&amp;D \n\nintensive industries, especially pharmaceuticals; \n\n? Option to alter operating scale (e.g., to expand, contract, shut down, and restart): If \n\nmarket conditions are more favorable than expected, the line can expand the scale of \n\nproduction or accelerate resource utilization.  Conversely, if conditions are less \n\nfavorable than expected, it can reduce the scale of operations.  In extreme cases, \n\nproduction may temporarily halt and start up again; \n\n? Option to abandon or Shut Down: If market conditions decline severely, management \n\ncan abandon current operations and realize the resale value of capital equipment and \n\nother assets in secondhand markets; and \n\n? Growth options: An early investment (e.g., R&amp;D, lease on undeveloped land or oil \n\nreserves, strategic acquisition, information network, and infrastructure) is a \n\nprerequisite or link in a chain of interrelated projects, opening up future growth \n\nopportunities (e.g., a new generation product or process, oil reserves, access to new \n\nmarkets, or strengthening of core capabilities). \n\nCopeland and Weston (1982) also discussed an important application especially for this study: \n\nthe option to cancel a contract. This option is quite different from the traditional Real Option \n\napproach as it is an American put option that one presents to another party during a contract \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nnegotiation. In the case of a financial lease with such an option, it is equivalent to a pure \n\nfinancial lease minus an American put option with a (non-stochastic) declining exercise price. \n\nThe expected rate of return on a cancellable lease is shown to be higher than the rate on a pure \n\nfinancial lease in order to pay for such option. \n\nFrom a general environment, competition, and strategic viewpoint, Real Options has the \n\npotential to make a significant difference when applied to competition and strategy analyses.  \n\nSustainable competitive advantages resulting from patents, proprietary technologies, \n\nownership of valuable natural resources, managerial capital, reputation or brand name, scale, \n\nand market power enable companies with valuable options to grow through future profitable \n\ninvestments and more effectively respond to unexpected adversity or opportunities in a \n\nchanging technological, competitive, or general business environment.  The classical \n\napplications in this concept are: \n\n? Oil and gas and mining industries: Mining and oil companies have to decide when to \n\ndevelop the reservoirs they own and how much to bid for the right to develop \n\nadditional properties or fields.  Such decisions often involve a combination of options \n\nsuch as the option to learn about the quantity of minerals present underground and the \n\noption to defer development until mineral or oil prices are favorable (Trigeorgis, 1993);  \n\n? Cancelable Operating Lease: A manufacturer of jet engines, for example, would \n\nregularly purchase the plane for its client airline and lease it for commercial use, \n\nprovided the airline agreed to install the manufacturer\u2019s engines in the plane. \n\nAdditionally, it was customary to give the airlines the right to cancel the lease and \n\nreturn the plane during a period prior to delivery and for up to a year after delivery. \n\nThe costs involved in this option were immense and would fluctuate according to the \n\nclient\u2019s operation performance volatility. The right to cancel the lease was treated as \n\nan American put option that could be exercised by the airline when, during a downturn \n\nin passenger revenue miles, the value of the plane in operation became less than the \n\nvalue of the lease payments due (Copeland; Antikarov, 2005); \n\n? Flexible manufacturing: Flexible manufacturing systems, flexible production \n\ntechnologies, and other machinery having multiple uses can be analyzed from an \n\noptions perspective.  It might value the flexibility, for example, of a dual-fuel \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nindustrial steam boiler that can switch between alternative energies (natural gas and oil) \n\nas their relative prices fluctuate (Trigeorgis, 1993); \n\n? Land development industry: It can show that the value of vacant land should reflect \n\nnot only its value based on its best immediate use (e.g., from constructing a building \n\nnow), but also its option value if development is delayed and the land is converted for \n\nits best alternative use in the future.  It may thus be beneficial to hold land vacant for \n\nits option value even in currently thriving real estate markets (Trigeorgis, 1993); \n\n? Competition analysis: Smit and Ankum (1993) considered that an investment strategy \n\nencompasses a sequence of tactical investment projects, of which several may yield a \n\nlow return when considered in isolation.  The net present value method has serious \n\nshortcomings for analyzing projects when future decisions are contingent on \n\nintermediate developments in an uncertain environment.  Option theory provides a \n\nbetter analytical tool to evaluate such projects. Postponement under perfect \n\ncompetition implies a loss in the expected value of the project due to anticipated \n\ncompetitive entry. (Boyer &amp; Gravel, 2004). \n\n3.4 Main Differences between Real Options and Financial Options  \n\n3.4.1 Terms and Parameters \n\nWhen financial options have a detailed contract, real options must be identified and specified. \n\nAlthough insights from the Real Options way of thinking are relevant across a number of \n\nindustries, each application must be fit for the specifics of the particular industry as well as \n\nthe market. Table 3.1 has a comparison between the two types of options. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 Terms and Parameters of Financial Options and Real Options \n\nBlack-Scholes \n\nParameter \n\n(Financial Options) \n\nAnalogous Real \n\nOptions Parameters \n\nExample of Sources of \n\nUncertainty \n\nStock price, S Present value of \n\nexpected cash flows \n\nfrom investment \n\nMarket demand for products and \n\nservices, labor supply and cost, \n\nmaterials supply and cost \n\nExercise price, X Present value of \n\nrequired investment \n\n(CAPEX) \n\nAvailability, timing and price of \n\nassets to be purchased \n\nStock price \n\nvolatility, ? \n\nVolatility of underlying \n\ncash flows \n\nVolatility in market demand, \n\nlabor cost, materials cost, \n\ncorrelation of model \n\nassumptions \n\nTime to \n\nexpiration, T \n\nPeriod for which \n\ninvestment \n\nopportunity is \n\navailable \n\nProduct life cycle, competitive \n\nadvantage \n\nDividend rate,   Cash flows lost to \n\ncompetitors \n\nProduct life cycle, competitive \n\nadvantage, convenience yield \n\nRisk-free interest \n\nrate, r \n\nRisk-free interest rate Inflation, money market \n\nbehavior \n\nSource: Cobb and Charnes, 2009. \n\n \n\n3.4.2 Value Observation \n\nThe underlying assets of Real Options are different from financial options in that they are \n\nrarely traded in quoted markets, which might create difficulties in establishing their fair prices. \n\nMoreover, the nonexistence of a historical price series of the underlying assets makes it \n\ndifficult to calculate their historical volatility. In the context of financial options, one can \n\nclearly state a priori when a given option will be profitable and worth exercising. However, in \n\nthe case of Real Options regarding strategic opportunities in which new possibilities are \n\nidentified as a consequence of a firm\u2019s actions, such a priori specification may not be possible. \n\nExperiments, even unsuccessful ones, not only provide information about intended investment \n\npaths but also provide information about other possibilities that may not even have been \n\nenvisioned at the time of the initial investments (Adner; Levinthal, 2004). \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4.3 Knowledge and Information \n\nReal Options gives the investing firm access to proprietary knowledge that a non-investing \n\nfirm cannot obtain (or will take longer to obtain). In contrast, financial options do not provide \n\naccess to \u201cinside\u201d knowledge about the investment opportunity; all investors have access to \n\nthe same knowledge about the investment opportunity at the current and in the future. A real \n\noption can also provide privileged access to resources, hence restricting potential competitors. \n\nFinancial options do not preclude others from making the same or similar investments. Real \n\nOptions provides learning curve advantages that can be leveraged into a competitive \n\nadvantage if the investment opportunity subsequently proves beneficial; something financial \n\noptions do not provide (Brouthers; Brouthers; Werner, 2008). \n\n \n\n3.5 Real Option Quantitative Models and Valuation \n\nAccording to Trigeorgis (1993), the quantitative origins of Real Options derive from the \n\nseminal work of Black and Scholes and Merton in pricing financial options.  Cox, Ross, and \n\nRubinstein's binomial approach enabled a simpler valuation of options in discrete time.  The \n\nactual valuation of options in practice has been greatly facilitated by Cox's and Ross's \n\nrecognition that an option can be replicated (or a \"synthetic option\" created) from an \n\nequivalent portfolio of traded securities.  \n\nBeing independent of risk attitudes or capital market equilibrium considerations, such risk-\n\nneutral valuation, enables present-value discounting at the risk-free interest rate of expected \n\nfuture payoffs (with actual probabilities replaced with risk-neutral ones), a fundamental \n\ncharacteristic of \"arbitrage-free\" price systems involving traded securities. \n\nThe main quantitative model and theories that will be used in the research are: \n\n \n\n3.5.1 Black-Scholes Model \n\nThe practical application of options to projects has been discussed by Luehrman (1998). He \n\ndiscussed the analogy between financial options and corporate investments, provided a \n\nframework for mapping the project onto the option framework, and reinforced that DCF \n\ntechniques and Real Options are complements rather than substitutes to each other.  The \n\ncapital investment decision is compared to a European call option that is valued using the \n\nBlack-Scholes Model. To map a corporate investment onto a call option opportunity, he \n\nproposes: C = S0N(d1) \u2013 Xe\n-rT \n\nN(d2), where (Varma, 2011): \n\no C is the value of call option; \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\no S0 is the present value of a project\u2019s operating assets to be acquired; \n\no X is CAPEX required to acquire the project assets; \n\no r is the risk-free rate of return; \n\no T is the length of time the decision may be deferred; \n\no ?\n2\n is the riskiness of the project assets; \n\no d1 = {ln(S0 /X) + (r + ?\n2 \n\n/2)*t}/ ( ? 2)*T \n\no and d2 =  ? ?T - d1. \n\nThe total value of the project will be the Adjusted Present Value, composed for: Traditional \n\nNPV + Value of Real Options. \n\n \n\n3.5.2 Binomial Lattice Model \n\nThe binomial option pricing model has been presented by  Cox, Ross, and Rubinstein (1979) \n\nas a simpler and more efficient numerical procedure for valuing options in which a premature \n\nexercise may be optimal. The basic idea was replicating the option payoff by constructing a \n\nportfolio out of a risk-free rate bond and the underlying stock (replicating portfolio). The \n\nunique feature of the binomial tree is that the outcome from moving up and then down is the \n\nsame as the outcome of first moving down and then up. This sequence is repeated over time. \n\nThe advantage of using a binomial lattice model over the Black-Scholes model is that it can \n\nbe used to value American options. Consider, as in Trigeorgis (1993), valuing a generic \n\ninvestment opportunity as an example of the backward induction calculation used the Real \n\nOption valuation: \n\n? The opportunity to invest I0= $104 (in millions) in an oil project whose value in each \n\nperiod will either move up by 80% or down by 40%, depending on oil price \n\nfluctuations. The current oil price is $20, which represents a project gross value of \n\n$100 million. One year later, the project will have an expected value (from subsequent \n\ncash flows) of $180 if the oil price moves up (C\n+\n = 180) or $60 if it moves down (C\n\n-\n = \n\n60). There is an equal probability (q = 0.5) that the price of oil will move up or down \n\nin any year. \n\n? The extension of the binomial movements, up by 80% or down by 40% in this case, \n\nand risk-neutral probabilities could be estimated by several methods. They incorporate \n\ninformation about the uncertainty, or \"volatility,\" of outcomes associated with the \n\nproject. The most common method is to follow the convention used by  Cox, Ross, \n\nand Rubinstein (1979). The up and down movements at each step are u =e\n???t\n\n  and \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nd=1/u, where ? is the volatility of asset returns per time increment in the tree and ??t \n\nis the length of the time increment (Hahn; Brandao; Dyer, 2010). \n\n? Let S be the price of oil or generally of a \"twin security\" that is traded in the financial \n\nmarkets and has the same risk characteristics with the real project under consideration, \n\nfor example a stock price of a similarly operating unlevered oil company. Both the \n\nproject and its twin security (or oil prices) have an expected rate of return (or discount \n\nrate) of k = 20%, while the risk-free interest rate is 8%. \n\n? Consider the following binomial tree: \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 3.1 Binomial tree for investment opportunity example \n\n Source: Trigeorgis (1993) \n\n \n\n? For example, the pair (V0, S0) above represents a current gross project value of $100 \n\nmillion, and a spot oil price of $20 a barrel (or a $20 per share of the twin oil \n\ncompany).  \n\n? Under traditional (passive) NPV analysis the current gross project value would be \n\nobtained first by discounting the project's end-of-period values (derived from \n\nsubsequent cash flows), using the expected rate of return of the project's twin security \n\n(or, here, of oil prices) as the appropriate discount rate, i.e., V0 = (0.5 x 180 + 0.5 x \n\n60)/1.20 = 100. After subtracting the current investment costs I0= $104, the project's \n\nNPV is finally given as: NPV = V0- I0= -4 (<0). \n\n? Because of the absence of managerial flexibility or real options, traditional DCF \n\nanalysis would have rejected this project based on its negative NPV. The fundamental \n\nproblem lies in the valuation of investment opportunities whose claims are not \n\nsymmetric or proportional and whose discount rates vary in a complex way over time. \n\nUsing contingent claims analysis (CCA) within a backward risk-neutral valuation \n\nprocess, the same solution can be obtained in our actual risk-averse world as in a \"risk-\n\nneutral\" world in which the current value of any contingent claim could be obtained \n\nfrom its expected future values with expectations taken over the risk-neutral \n\n(100, 20)\n\n(180, 36)\n\n(36, 7.2)\n\nYear 1 Year 2 Year 3\n\n(108, 21.6)\n\n(324, 64.88)\n\n(60, 12)\n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nprobabilities p, inputted from the twin security's (or oil) prices discounted at a risk-free \n\nrate, r. In such a risk-neutral world, the current (beginning of the period) value of the \n\nproject (or of the equity holders\u2019 claims), E, is given by:    \n             \n\n   \n where \n\np \n          \n\n     \n , the probability, p, can be estimated from the price dynamics of the twin \n\nsecurity (or of oil prices in the example):  \n              \n\n     \n     . \n\n? Observe that the value for p = 0.4 is distinct from the actual probability, q = 0.5. This \n\ncan be used to determine expected cash flows, which can be properly discounted at the \n\nrisk-free rate. For example,    \n             \n\n   \n    \n\n                  \n\n    \n     \n\n? This confirms the gross project value V0 = 100, calculated early using traditional DCF \n\nwith the actual probability q = 0.5 and the risk-adjusted discount rate (K = 0.20). \n\nAlthough it achieved the same results, this approach is extremely practical to address \n\nmore complex real option situations. The investment outlay (having a present value of \n\n$104 million) will not be spent immediately but in future installments. The amount \n\nthat is not immediately spent should earn the riskless interest rate. This framework \n\nallows for the evaluation of upside-potential options, such as deferring or expanding; \n\nand downside-protection options, such as abandoning for salvage value or defaulting \n\nduring construction.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\n3.5.3 Main Characteristics of Black-Scholes and Binomial Models \n\nTable 3.2 Methodology Comparison\n1\n \n\n Standard Black-Scholes Standard Binomial\n2\n \n\nExplicit Assumptions   \n\nS - value of underlying \n\nProject \n\nlognormally distributed binomially distributed \n\n(in practice, binomial \n\nparameters are typically \n\nchosen assuming that S is \n\nlognormally distributed) \n\n? - volatility of S constant \n\nX - option's exercise price deterministic \n\nr - interest rate constant \n\nT - option's life span short-lived  (have to define) no-limit \n\nExistence of market for S A is traded and no arbitrage opportunities exist \n\nProperties \n\nSolution approach closed-form (analytic) \n\nformula \n\nnumeric simulation \n\nSensitivity analysis using analytic partial derivatives numeric approximation of \n\n\"partial derivatives\" \n\nCalculates option price on-\n\nor-before expiration \n\nNo (only on expiration) the \n\ntraditional, but derivate \n\nmodels allows (Black\u2019s \n\napproximation) \n\nYes (can find optimal \n\nexercise time) \n\nImplementation Computational simplicity conceptual simplicity and \n\nflexibility \n\nSource: Benaroch and Kauffman (1999)  \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1\n    Legend: S: Present value of expected results from the operational project (i.e., the value of option's \n\nunderlying risky asset); X: Cost of converting the investment opportunity into an operational project (i.e., the \n\noption's exercise price); T: Maximum time to defer conversion of the investment opportunity into an operational \n\nproject (i.e., the option's time to expiration).  \n2\n   Cox, Ross &amp; Rubinstein model. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n3.6 Main Concepts Involved on Real Option Methodology \n\n3.6.1 Contingent Claims Analysis (CCA) \n\nThis approach assumes the existence of a sufficiently rich set of markets in risky assets so that \n\nthe stochastic component of the risky project under consideration can be exactly replicated. \n\nThrough appropriate long and short positions, a riskless portfolio can be constructed \n\nconsisting of the risky project and investment assets that track the project\u2019s uncertainty. In \n\nequilibrium with no arbitrage opportunities, this portfolio must earn the risk-free rate of \n\ninterest, which allows the value of the risky project to be determined. The no-arbitrage \n\nassumption avoids the necessity of determining the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate. \n\nHowever, if a portion of the return from holding the risky asset is due to an unobservable \n\nconvenience yield, it is still necessary to estimate either that convenience yield or a market \n\nprice of risk, which is often complicated (Insley; Wirjanto, 2010). \n\n \n\n3.6.2 Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)  \n\nGeometric Brownian motion (also known as exponential Brownian motion) a continuous-time \n\nstochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a \n\nBrownian motion, is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic \n\ndifferential equation. In particular, it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in \n\nthe Black\u2013Scholes model. \n\n \n\n3.6.3 (MAD) Market Asset Disclaimer \n\nThe Market Asset Disclaimer (MAD) approach developed by Copeland and Antikarov treats \n\nthe project and real option as if they were actually traded. The best replicating asset for the \n\noption is assumed to be the project without flexibility, which is valued using the NPV method. \n\nThe need to find an actual traded replicating portfolio is removed because Copeland and \n\nAntikarov reason that no \u201casset has a better correlation with the project, than the project itself.\u201d \n\nThe NPV approach does not value risks properly, so correctly pricing the project without \n\nflexibility (e.g., using the correct discount rate) is just as complex and important as valuing \n\nthe flexibility (Edge, 2011). \n\n \n\n3.6.4 Binomial Lattice in Terms of cash Flow \n\nOne very important approach used in this Real Option application, described by Brand\u00e3o, \n\nDyer and Hahn (2005), is to project the binomial lattice using the basic variable: the project \n\ncash flows instead of only the total project value of each node. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n To do this, the cash flow payout rate is used d = Ci / Vi to calculate the cash flows that are \n\npaid out at the end of each time period as a function of the project value. It is assumed that the \n\ncash flows will vary over time, reflecting the uncertainty of the project value, but that they \n\nwill remain a constant fraction of the residual value of the project in each period. These cash \n\nflows(Ci,j) will therefore be a function of the project value and the stochastic process that \n\ndrives the binomial model. The primary advantage of this approach is that it provides greater \n\nflexibility in the modeling of the real options of the project. To obtain the cash flows, the first \n\nstep is to build the pre-cash flow payout values tree. These values are calculated according to \n\nthe following equations, in which the superscripts u and d correspond to the up and down state \n\nvalues and the state subscript is suppressed: Vi\nu \n\n= (Vi-1 \u2013 Vi-1di-1)u and Vi\nd \n= (Vi-1 \u2013 Vi-1di-1)d. \n\n  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n4  RESEARCH METHOD \n\n4.1 Case Study Methodology \n\nThere is a considerable amount of literature regarding Real Options and its applications to \n\ncapital budgeting with solid methodologies developed on this theme.  Because there is a huge \n\nresource bank of case studies available in the current literature and I have access to internal \n\noperational and financial information, I favored a case study method.  This research used the \n\ncurrent literature and application of Real Options methodology in a real case study to discuss \n\nthe application and insights in a real-world situation. \n\nThe corresponding research question is therefore: Which of the most common frameworks of \n\nReal Options better fits the evaluation of capital investments for the proposed case study? The \n\nbest framework should improve the analysis\u2019 explanatory power for decision makers and be a \n\nfeasible application for finance professionals. \n\nThe form of the research questions, the focus on understanding the dynamics presented within \n\na single set of parameters, and the combination of data collection methods such as archives \n\nand observations will all contribute to the choice of case study as the research method, \n\nfollowing the recommendations of  Eisenhardt, (2011). \n\nFurthermore, as a director of an oil and gas field services company responsible for the capital \n\nbudgeting process and someone who has worked with capital budgeting for more than 10 \n\nyears, I have had the opportunity to obtain in-depth information that is probably not available \n\nto outside investigators. This unique perspective rendered the case revelatory. \n\nInitially, the current body of literature was reviewed (papers and surveys) to analyze the most \n\ncommon investment project valuation methods (NPV) analysis (Payback, Real Options, etc.) \n\nand their restrictions from the perspective of finance professionals. The aim was to understand \n\nthe main difficulties faced in the application of the methodologies. \n\nIn the second stage, data was collected, focusing on the raw data regarding the investment \n\nopportunities approval and historic performance of the projects. The information was gathered \n\nfollowing the data collection plan outlined in Appendix A. \n\nFinally, one Real Options methodology was applied to the case study following a proper \n\nmethodology.  Results were analyzed, and the following points were discussed: \n\n? Types of embedded Real Options that the project had; \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\n? Methodologies used to assign risks to the projects; \n\n? Expected results (project valuation) versus actual results comparative analysis; \n\n4.2 Choosing the Right Framework for the Case Study \n\nAfter reviewing several Real Options methodologies and reproducing several of these case \n\nstudies, the Real Options field appears very disperse among several streams, with no \n\nmainstream approach. Up to this point, the research was jeopardized due to the lack of \n\npractical and applicable framework to evaluate the proposed case study. The research needed \n\nfocus, and a series of three articles helped to clarify the current situation of the field and the \n\nposition I should take for this study. The three articles are a sequence of discussions on the \n\nfuture and applicability of the methodology: \n\n? Real Options Analysis: Where are the Emperor's Clothes? (Borison, 2005) \n\n? Real Options: Meeting the Georgetown Challenge (Copeland; Antikarov, 2005) \n\n? A Response to \u201cReal Options: Meeting the Georgetown Challenge\" (Borison, 2005) \n\n \n\nAfter analyzing the different positions set forth by the above articles, this research employed \n\nthat of Copeland and Antikarov (2005).  Their article was a response to the Real Options \n\nsymposium held on the campus of Georgetown University in 2003, during which a panel of \n\nknowledgeable academics and practitioners voiced concern about the need for both a \n\nconsensus about methodology and easy-to-use software for Real Options. In the article, the \n\nauthors attempted to provide the foundation for establishing a consensus on methodology. \n\nThey also responded to criticism by Adam Borison (2005) of both the theory and current \n\npractice of Real Options.   They proposed the methodology described in Figure 4.1. based on \n\nthe Binomial Lattice model. They discarded the use of the Black-Scholes model for the \n\nfollowing reasons: \n\n? The Real Options approach assumes that the value of the project with flexibility \n\nshould be equal to the NPV of the \u201cbase case\u201d cash flows (the value of the project \n\nwithout flexibility) plus the (option) value of the management\u2019s ability to respond to \n\nchange. This is an especially important point because the cash outflows from a project \n\nare analogous to dividends paid on a stock; just as the price of a stock drops when it \n\ngoes ex-dividend, cash outflows reduce the value of the project as they are paid \n\n(Copeland; Antikarov, 2005). The traditional Black-Scholes formula assumes that the \n\nunderlying risky asset (the capital project) pays no dividends (has no cash flows) \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nduring its life, which is not the case for most investment projects such as the one \n\nexamined in this case study. \n\n? Most Real Options can be exercised at any time during the life of a project, such as the \n\noption to cancel the contract, which will be later discussed. Real Options requires an \n\nAmerican option valuation technique.  Black-Scholes, however, is designed to value \n\nEuropean options for which exercise takes place only at the expiration date.  \n\n? Another limitation of Black-Scholes is that most Real Option projects involve \n\ncompound options, as demonstrated in this case study. Black-Scholes is not well \n\nsuited to valuing such options.  \n\n? Projects can have negative NPVs, a possibility that cannot be accommodated by the \n\nBlack-Scholes model, which is designed to work with financial options. Such options \n\nalways have non-negative values. \n\n? Use math that everyone can understand. The Black-Scholes model is usually called a \n\n\u201cblack box,\u201d which refers to a formula that, once the inputs are placed, the results are \n\ncalculated and the process cannot be easily audited or variables cross-checked. As \n\ndiscussed by Copeland and Antikarov (2005), who knows whether the conclusions are \n\nright or wrong? How does one explain them to the top management of a company? \n\nHow would you like to explain the difference between a Gauss-Wiener process, \n\ngeometric Brownian motion, arithmetic Brownian motion or a jump process to a \n\ncompetent CFO?  \n\nOne of the important screenings in the selection of the methodology to be applied in the case \n\nstudy was my ability to be comfortable with the algebra involved. As an average practitioner \n\nof capital budget analysis, any method involving complex calculus, advanced statistics or \n\nstochastic calculus was disregarded as viable methodology.  \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 4.1 Five-Step Process for Real Option Valuation \n \n\nSource: Author adaptation of COPELAND, T.

It has operations in several countries in Latin and North America. Currently, \n\nthe company has structured a formal capital budgeting process based on senior management \n\ndiscussions and DCF analysis supported by traditional metrics such as NPV, IRR, and \n\nPayback. The company in which the case study took place is referred as OFS and the \n\ninvestment project \u201cRig O.\u201d To comply with the confidentiality of some information true \n\nparameter values were replaced by imagined ones. All the figures were multiplied by a randon \n\nnumber. However, the analysis and Real Option computation and conclusion remain valid. \n\n5.2 Investment Decision for Drilling Rig in Colombia \n\nOFS management analyzed and approved the drilling rig project in mid-2008. At the time of \n\nthe investment approval, the Colombian operation of OFS was presenting very good results as \n\nshown in Figure 5.1 and the market was very bullish in Colombia. The CDS (credit default \n\nswap), a measure of investment risk in Colombia, was low, as shown in Figure 5.2, and oil \n\nprices were at an all-time high, Figure 5.3, guaranteeing comfortable returns for new drilling \n\nactivity. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.1 OFS Colombian Operation Financial Performance\n\n3\n \n\nSource: OFS Information \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 Colombian Credit Default Swap \n\nSource: Bloomberg \n\n                                                 \n3\n CAGR: Compound Average Growth Rate \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n5\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n5\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n6\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n6\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n6\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n6\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n7\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n7\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n7\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n7\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n8\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n8\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n4\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n4\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n5\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n4\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n4\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n5\n\nCAGR: +8%\n\nOFS Colombia Quarterly EBITDA\n\nColombian CDS\n\n50\n\n101\n\n61\n\n26\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nJ\nu\n\nn\n/0\n\n8\n\nM\na\n\ny\n/0\n\n8\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n\n8\n\nM\na\n\nr/\n0\n\n8\n\nF\ne\n\nb\n/0\n\n8\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n/0\n\n8\n\nD\ne\n\nc\n/0\n\n7\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n7\n\nO\nc\nt/\n0\n\n7\n\nS\ne\n\np\n/0\n\n7\n\nA\nu\n\ng\n/0\n\n7\n\nJ\nu\n\nl/\n0\n\n7\n\nJ\nu\n\nn\n/0\n\n7\n\nM\na\n\ny\n/0\n\n7\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n\n7\n\nM\na\n\nr/\n0\n\n7\n\nF\ne\n\nb\n/0\n\n7\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n/0\n\n7\n\nD\ne\n\nc\n/0\n\n6\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n6\n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.3 Oil Prices and monthly average and standard deviation for the period \n\nSource: Bloomberg \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 Client E Share Price Evolution \n\nSource: Bloomberg \n\n \n\nThe investment proposal for the purchase of Rig O was a response to Client E\u2019s strategy for \n\nthe future development of its fields in Colombia. Client E was one of the largest global oil \n\ncompanies with a long presence in the region. The project intended to purchase a state-of-the-\n\nart drilling rig, which would drill multilaterally\n4\n, in an initial 18-month pilot program. The \n\nproject was expected to have a high success rate, and therefore commitment to this rig would \n\nbe at least 5 years time. In this project the client was to pay for all fuel used in the operation \n\nreducing the project risk. Fuel costs amount for 20% of the total cost of a drilling operation.  \n\nTable 5.1 illustrates the initial investment analysis. \n\n                                                 \n4\n It is a new technology to create wells with multiple branches that can target widely spaced reservoir \n\ncompartments provides engineers unlimited options in optimizing economic extraction of oil and gas. \n\n66\n72\n\n132\n\n83\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n6\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n6\n\n102\n\nJ\nu\nn\n/0\n\n8\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n8\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n8\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n0\n8\n\nF\ne\nb\n\n/0\n8\n\nJ\na\nn\n/0\n\n8\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n7\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n7\n\nO\nc\nt/\n\n0\n7\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/0\n7\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/0\n7\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n0\n7\n\nJ\nu\nn\n/0\n\n7\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n7\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n7\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n0\n7\n\nF\ne\nb\n\n/0\n7\n\nJ\na\nn\n/0\n\n7\n\nOil Prices\n\nAverage 80.6         \n\nStandar Deviation 24.2%\n\n \n\nClient E Share Price \n\n88 \n87 \n\n96 \n\n100 \n99 \n\n87 \n\n80 \n\n85 \n\n90 \n\n95 \n\n100 \n\n105 \n\n94 \n\n80 \n\nJun/08 \nMay/ 08 Apr/ 08 Mar/08 \n\n85 \n\nFeb/08 Jan/08 Dec/ 07 Nov/ 07 Oct/ 07 Sep/ 07 \nAug/ 07 Jul/ 07 Jun/07 May/ 07 Apr/ 07 Mar/07 Feb/07 Jan/07 Dec/ 06 Nov/ 06 \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 Original Investment Analysis for Rig O Project\n5\n \n\n \n\n Source: OFS Information \n\n \n\n5.3 Rig O Project Business Case Assumptions \n\nThe 2008 original business case included operational assumptions very similar to the \n\ncompany\u2019s average operations for the last twelve months (2007 and 2008). Although the \n\nhistorical data did not represent the exact rigs (the company did not have a rig as automatic \n\nand new as this one) it clearly represented a floor in terms of efficiency and margins (see \n\nTable 5.2). It also assumed that the rig would be contracted for the next ten years with the \n\nsame operational assumptions. It is a very bold assumption considering that the industry is \n\nvery cyclical and the client\u2019s initial contract was only for a period of 18 months. The \n\ninvestment project consisted in a 26.4 million investment on the rig and import duties. In 2008, \n\nColombia had a tax rebate that totaled almost 5.5 million for the purchase of such capital good \n\nitem.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                 \n5\n The original business case discounted cash flow consider nominal prices and costs in US$ dollars and it also \n\nconsiderers a nominal discount rate.   \n\nGrowth Project  0 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5 6.5 7.5 8.5 9.5 \n\nPROJECT NET INCOME STATEMENT \n\nTotal Revenues 8,472 11,944 11,944 11,944 11,944 11,944 11,944 11,944 11,944 11,944 \nOperating Costs 4,441 5,930 5,930 5,930 5,930 5,930 5,930 5,930 5,930 5,930 \nGross Margin 4,031 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 \nGross Margin  48% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% \nSG&amp;A Expenses 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nEBITDA 4,031 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 \nEBITDA 48% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% 50% \nDepreciation &amp; Amortization 2,400 2,400 2,400 2,400 2,400 2,400 2,400 2,400 2,400 2,400 \nEarnings from Operations 1,631 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 \nTotal Other Income and (Expense) \nEarnings Before Taxes 1,631 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 3,614 \nTotal Income Taxes 538 1,193 1,193 1,193 1,193 1,193 1,193 1,193 1,193 1,193 \nNet Income 1,093 2,421 2,421 2,421 2,421 2,421 2,421 2,421 2,421 2,421 \nNet Income  13% 20% 20% 20% 20% 20% 20% 20% 20% 20% \n\nPROJECT FREE CASH FLOW STATEMENT \n\nEBITDA 0.0 4,031 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 6,014 \n +/- Working Capital \n - Capex -24,000 \n + Tax benefits -2,416 5,584 \n - Income Tax 0 -538 -1,193 -1,193 -1,193 -1,193 -1,193 -1,193 -1,193 -1,193 -1,193 \n + Salvage Value 23,000 \nFCF -26,416 9,531 4,821 4,821 4,821 4,821 4,821 4,821 4,821 4,821 27,821 \nACCUMULATED FCF -26,416 -16,885 -12,064 -7,243 -2,421 2,400 7,222 12,043 16,864 21,686 49,507 \nVALUATION SUMMARY \nNPV @ 10% 16,358.1 \nIRR 21% \nPayback Period 4.5 years \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nTable 5.2 Operational Assumptions Benchmark for Project O \n\n \n\n \n\n LTM Operational Assumptions  \n\n \n\n OFS Comparable Rigs  \n\n \n\nProposed \n\n \n\n Rig B1   Rig B2  \n\n \n\n Business Plan \n\n Day Rate              33,925                    44,038  \n\n \n\n              35,296  \n\n Day Cost              17,617                    24,319  \n\n \n\n              17,524  \n\n Utilization %  96% 96% \n\n \n\n94% \n\n Direct Margin %  49% 46% \n\n \n\n50% \n\nSource: OFS Information \n\n \n\n5.3.1 Business Case Standardization \n\nIn order to make the investment analysis comparable, the original business case assumptions \n\nwere translated into a standard monthly DCF model. It used the same WACC. Some \n\nassumptions were revised in the eyes of the timeframe in which the investment analysis was \n\nperformed, correcting some gross simplifications and conceptual mistakes. In the case of Rig \n\nO investment analysis, the following adjustments and revisions were required:  \n\n? The DCF analysis was previously only annual; it was adapted for a monthly \n\nprojection. The monthly projection was used in order to facilitate the breakdown of \n\nthe total project into several contracts that are not necessarily multiples of 12 months. \n\nThe monthly projection also facilitates the identification of trends and impacts within \n\nthe year. \n\n? The original model considered the depreciation as an annual charge even though it \n\nconsidered only a half-year of operations (revenues and costs). \n\n? The original model did not consider any working capital investments. Using the April \n\n2008 average Days of Sales Outstanding (DSO) and average Days of Payables \n\nOutstanding (DPO), the total working capital investment was almost $1 million. \n\n? Maintenance time and time lost within contracts: The original case considered the \n\nRig working for almost 10 years without any contractual or maintenance stop. It did \n\nnot consider any additional CAPEX in the following years for maintenance overhaul \n\nand technological updates. It was adjusted to reflect the following assumptions: \n\no One month stop (without revenues) every beginning of new contract; \n\no $200,000 maintenance CAPEX every beginning of new contract; \n\no 24 months contracts after the initial contract; \n\no $1 million CAPEX after 5 years for technological update. \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n? The salvage value for the Rig at the end of year ten in the original analysis was \n\nunrealistic: it was 87% of the initial investment. It was adjusted for a more realistic \n\nvalue, the liquidation value or forced sale value. The liquidation value was estimated \n\nbased on the real useful life of the rig, 30 years, and that a forced sale would be 32% \n\nof the original investment plus any refurbishment and technological updates, \n\ndepreciated in 30 years. The 32% value was calculated based on recent appraisal for \n\nthe company assets. \n\n? For taxes purposes was used a 10 year depreciation for the rig. The depreciation \n\nreduces the net income from the project consequently reducing the amount of taxes \n\npaid.  \n\nTable 5.3 contains the revised discounted cash flow analysis after the adjustments that was the \n\nbase for the Real Option analysis. \n\nTable 5.3 Revised NPV Evaluation of Rig O Investment Project\n7\n \n\n \nSource: Author\u2019s review based on OFS information \n\n                                                 \n7\n The same nominal prices and costs in US$ dollars assumption of the original business case was maintained. It \n\nassumes that the company will not pass to the tariffs the US$ inflation and will also keep its cost structure \n\ncontrolled in US$ terms. \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n5.3.2 OFS contract with client E: \n\nMost investment analyses and decisions are made before any contract or formal arrangement \n\nwith the client is made. In the case of a large investment, it is recommended that the \n\ncontractual terms be fully reflected in the investment analysis and consequently in the \n\ndecision. This allows for avoidance of a very common trap, which results when the decision is \n\napproved under certain assumptions and the project is implemented under different and more \n\nrelaxed assumptions. However, in most cases, it is not practical to negotiate the terms of both \n\nthe contract and the investment decisions together and the investments are approved under \n\nassumptions that should reflect the future contractual structure and terms. Most of the \n\ncontractual terms of a drilling rig contract in the industry are standard, taking it into \n\nconsideration, the original investment decision should have reflected those clauses. However, \n\nthis was not the case of the original investment decision: \n\n? The contract specified that the client could cancel the contract at any time, paying \n\nonly the demobilization tariff estimated at $2.5 million. The contract clearly includes \n\na put option for client E at no additional charge. The value of this option should be \n\ndiscounted from the NPV analysis for the decision-making. \n\n? Payment terms: The contract stipulates a 30-day payment after the client has certified \n\nall of the services. On average, it takes a total of 60 days to receive the services, \n\nwhich is a significant working capital investment that was not considered in the \n\noriginal analysis. The contract also stipulates that it may take longer if the client \n\nrequests additional information and the company is delaying answering. \n\n? The contract also stipulates penalties from 5% to 20% of the regular tariff if the \n\ncompany does not comply with a long list of contractual requirements. \n\nThe contract stipulated an 18-month contracted service with the option for the client \n\nto contract again under the same terms. In fact, this option does not have a lot of \n\nvalue for the analysis as the investment project already considers that the contract \n\nwill be renewed for 10 years with similar terms which is not appropriate.  \n\n5.4 Real Option analysis for Rig O Project \u2013 Indentifying the Uncertainties  \n\nTo apply the methodology of Real Options to evaluate the project for Rig O, a combination of \n\nthe five-step process proposed by COPELAND, T. E.; ANTIKAROV (2005) and the \n\nadjustment used by BRAND\u00c3O et al. (2005) was implemented.  Different from the \n\nCOPELAND, T. E.; ANTIKAROV (2005) approach, this method uses most of the binomial \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nlattice methodology in terms of cash flow already discounted by the risk-free rate. This \n\napproach facilitates results analyses and the modeling of the variables. \n\n \n\n5.4.1 Step1: Calculate NPV to estimate the market value for the project \n\nStep 1a: Our revised version of the original business case was the base DCF used to estimate \n\nthe project value. To facilitate the analysis, the discounted cash flow was divided into 5 \n\ncontracts: One base contract for 18 months, according the investment proposal with Client E, \n\nand 4 contracts for 24 months each.  \n\nStep 1b: Estimate the cost of capital. To facilitate the comparison with the original investment \n\nanalysis the same nominal WACC was used, 10%. This figure was the company-estimated \n\nnominal WACC at the time of the investment. \n\nStep 1c: During the application of the methodology, separating the different \u201cflows\u201d was \n\nfound to facilitate analysis and the binomial lattice approach, thus in the NPV analysis, they \n\ncan be mixed together. I separated all flows related to investment or divesture decisions \n\n(CAPEX, salvage value, margin lost between contracts) from other flows related to the \n\nregular operation activity (direct margin and working capital from rigs operations).   \n\nStep 1d: After separating the flows, each piece can be discounted by the same WACC and \n\nadded together in the NPV. \n\nTable 5.4 Project O NPV Breakdown \n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculation \n\n \n\n5.4.2 Step 2: Analyze Uncertainties: Define the main uncertainties \n\nThis was the most complex part of the analysis. In this step, it is necessary to decide what the \n\nmost important uncertainties that affect the project value are and the options that are \n\nincorporated in the project. It is tricky because there is no single methodology that will \n\nproduce the answers; only a deep understanding of the reality of the project, the complexity \n\nand dynamics of the industry will yield the answers. After defining these elements, it is \n\nnecessary to go back to the methodology to determine whether it can be modeled to analyze \n\nthe real impact (sensibility analysis) for the relevance of the variable and if it really should be \n\nincorporated in a day-to-day evaluation after a standard model has been developed. \n\nRig O\n\nPV Cash Flow s (operation) 29,480      \n\nPV Investm ents (22,892)\n\nPV Salvage Value 2,667        \n\nNPV 9,255        \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nIn this case, the first step is to recognize that unlike the original investment analysis, the \n\nproject is not a single series of cash flows from a single client. In fact, it is a combination of \n\nseveral sets of cash flows from various contracts, which may or may not come from a single \n\nclient. Here we have to assume some distribution of the contracts in order to be able to model: \n\nThe base contract is the first; it is an 18-month cash flow that has already been contracted \n\nwith Client E and has most of the value drivers defined, lowering uncertainties. \n\nThe second set of contracts are three 25-month contracts, including one month in the \n\nbeginning of the contract for rig up (perform maintenance) without revenues, and  one \n\nadditional 21-month contract; \n\nAfter the last contract, it was determined that three additional months were required to recover \n\nthe working capital (receivables) and to sell the rig for the liquidation value, totaling a 114-\n\nmonth projection plus 3 months to recovery the working capital equal to the revised NPV \n\ncalculation. \n\nTable 5.5 Project O Contract Breakdown Assumptions and CAPEX \n\n \n\nSource: Management estimates \n\nTable 5.6 PV of Cash Flow Breakdown Per Contract \n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s calculation \n\nStep 2a: Map the uncertainties \n\nAfter reframing the project, it was easier to define the main uncertainties involved in the \n\ncontracts and the options involved. The main uncertainties involved can be divided into two \n\nmain groups: \n\nOFS company Uncertainties or Technical Uncertainties:  \n\nRig Efficiency: Total days/hours worked and billed divided by the total days/hours contracted. \n\nA drilling rig such as the one described operates 24 hours per day 7 days per week and \n\ngenerates revenue according to the amount of hours or days it is ready to operate. A stable \n\nMonths Capex \n\nBase Contract (Client E) 18                21.09              \n\nNew  contract 1 25 0.20                \n\nNew  contract 2 25 0.20                \n\nNew  contract 3 25 1.00                \n\nNew  contract 4 21 0.20                \n\nTotal 5 Contracts 114              22.7                \n\nPV Cash Flow\n\nBase Contract (Client E) 6.4                      \n\nNew  contract 1 7.6                      \n\nNew  contract 2 6.3                      \n\nNew  contract 3 5.2                      \n\nNew  contract 4 4.0                      \n\nTotal 5 Contracts 29.5                    \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\noperation generally requires high levels of efficiency, around 98%; however, a rig could have \n\nseveral operational problems such as personnel strikes, difficulties in moving the rig between \n\nwells, mechanical problems or even human errors in the drilling activity. This uncertainty \n\naffects the base contract as well the new contracts. \n\nRig utilization: Rig utilization is a similar to the former variable, total days/hours worked and \n\nbilled divided by the total days/hours available, but it also considers the impact of an idle rig \n\nbetween contracts. It is important as the project has only one contract guaranteed. After the \n\nfirst contract was finished, the OFS was back to the market and susceptive to the market \n\nforces to get a new contract. \n\nTariff and Day Rate: Once the rig is engaged, this variable is mostly fixed as all tariffs are \n\ncalculated according to the contract with little space for renegotiation. Except by the mix of \n\ndifferent tariffs under which the rig may operate. However, as the contract is renewed or the \n\nrig is available for a new contract, it will have to take the new \u201cmarket\u201d tariff. The oil price \n\nhas an important influence on OFS tariffs. However, as it encompasses a 10-year timeframe, \n\nabrupt price changes could be mean reverting, reducing this impact in the model. Other \n\nvariables also affect the tariffs such as government stimulus for the industry, the complexity \n\nof the drilling services, the availability of competitors\u2019 rigs in the region. For this analysis the \n\nday rate variable is used, formed by all revenues generated during the month (from several \n\ntype of tariffs) divided by the total days it worked and billed. \n\nCosts and Day Cost: Differently from the tariffs that are mostly defined as the contract is \n\nsigned, the operational costs involved in the operation are not; foreign exchange variations \n\nand demand shocks could significantly influence the costs and the overall profitability of the \n\nproject. A very active drilling market affects the whole supply chain, increasing the price for \n\ntrucks, cranes, specialized labor, maintenance services, as well as for OFS services. For this \n\nanalysis the day cost variable is used, formed by all costs generated during the month (most \n\ntend to be variable regarding activity or days worked/billed) divided by the total days it \n\nworked and billed. \n\nClient / Operator Uncertainties or Market Uncertainties:  \n\nOil Price and Economic downturn: The OFS\u2019s clients are the ones who bear the direct impact \n\nof drastic fluctuations in the oil prices or an economic downturn; they are the ones who will \n\nsell oil at a lower price and at a lower volume. The drilling service they contract is only a part \n\nof the initial investment they have to incur to be able to sell their products; it is only one part \n\nof a more complex value chain. The practical implication of these uncertainties for the OFS \n\ninvestment project is: \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\n? If the oil price drops substantially with no expectation of recovery, the client\u2019s project \n\n(in which the rig is being used) may not be viable any more (in light of the new \n\nexpected price of oil).  In this case, the client could cancel the contract for a specified \n\npenalty (generally the demobilization costs). \n\n? In a downturn or in a lower oil price environment, the clients will be less willing to \n\ncontract new rigs, depressing the tariffs and the utilization. \n\nStep 2b: Keep separate those uncertainties that evolve discretely  \n\nAccording to Copeland and Antikarov (2005) there are three important things to keep in mind \n\nwhen modeling uncertainties: \n\n? It is possible to combine uncertainties provided they evolve more or less continuously \n\nover time and you capture the covariances among them as well as their autocorrelation \n\nover time. In the case we combined the efficiency, utilization with the day margin \n\nrisks. \n\n? When a source of uncertainty is resolved all at once and therefore is discontinuous \n\nover time, it should be kept separate from uncertainties that evolve continuously. In \n\nthe case we separated the risk of the client canceling the contract from the one related \n\nto the company efficiency and day margin.  \n\nUsing the previous division of uncertainties it becomes clear that part of the first group has a \n\ndirect impact on the OFS cash flow as it may manage and mitigate most of the risks. They are \n\ndirectly involved in the cash flow projections, for instance: the total revenue will depend on \n\nthe day rate and the efficiency, and the EBITDA and the working capital will depend on them \n\nand the day cost.  \n\nThe impact of the second group on OFS will depend on the economics of the operator project \n\nas the total investment it will require, expected lifting cost (cost to extract the oil after the well \n\nis complete), type of oil it will produce and the price it is expected to sell. The impact on the \n\nOFS cash flow will only be applicable if the operators cancel the contract or if they hire the \n\nOFS for a new contract with a lower tariff. \n\nThe Real Option analysis model treats the two cases separately as the underlying risks\u2019 \n\nvolatilities are different as well as the options involved for OFS. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nStep 2c: Combine those risks that evolve continuously through time using Monte Carlo \n\ntechniques \n\nIn order to define the appropriate volatility for the options involved in the first group of \n\nuncertainties discussed above, the MAD approach discussed previously was used with a \n\nMonte Carlo simulation. \n\nUsing this approach, I assumed that there was no perfectly correlated \u201ctwin security\u201d for the \n\ninvestment in the drilling rig. I used the NPV as the most accurate estimate of the value of the \n\nproject without flexibility, substituting for the value of the twin security. According to \n\nCopeland and Antikarov (2005), although this practice has been questioned, the assumption in \n\nthe MAD approach is the same one that corporate executives routinely make when using the \n\nNPV of projects as estimates of the market price of projects. It is consistent with the practical \n\napproach used in this study. \n\nFor modeling and conceptual proposes I combined two uncertainties, day rate and day cost, \n\ninto one variable, day margin. As the dynamics of this variable are strongly correlated to each \n\nother since some costs increase as labor costs are passed to the tariffs (in some contracts) and \n\nthe market dynamic of lower activity generating lower tariffs also reflects on lower \n\noperational costs of the whole market contracts, showing that this assumption is valid. \n\nTo capture the effects of the uncertainties that were discussed on project risk, the day margin \n\nand utilization rate were used to drive the Monte Carlo simulation of changes in project value. \n\nStep 2d: Use either historical data or subjective forward-looking management estimates to \n\ndrive the Monte Carlo Simulation\n8\n \n\nUsing historical data and management estimates, considering the information available at the \n\ntime. In the case of the investment project on Rig O, one might be tempted to identify the risk \n\nof the investment project with the volatility of the efficiency benchmark, 4.6% (Figure 5.5), or \n\nthe day margin of a benchmark rig, 16% (Figure 5.6).  \n\n                                                 \n8\n As in most of the cases in with there is no complete and reliable information to take a decision, we utilized \n\nmanagement estimates. These estimates are mostly based on past performance adjusted by the management \n\nexpectations of the future. It generates an immense field biased decisions being behavioral economics the best \n\napproach to deal with them. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 Efficiency Evolution of Benchmark rig \n\nSource: OFS internal data \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 5.6 Day Margin Evolution for Benchmark rig \n\nSource: OFS internal data \n\n \n\nHowever, it is important to recognize that although efficiency and day margin uncertainties \n\ndrive the risk of the project, it is not equivalent to that risk (as many Real Options applications \n\nseem to assume), and thus it is not a twin security. To incorporate these two risks into the \n\nMonte Carlo Simulation based on the original PV model, a combination of historical data and \n\nmanagement estimates for both risks was used. \n\n \n\n80\n\n85\n\n90\n\n95\n\n100\n\n96%\n\nM\na\nr/0\n\n8\n\nF\ne\nb\n/0\n\n8\n\nJ\na\nn\n/0\n\n8\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n7\n\nN\no\nv\n/0\n\n7\n\nO\nc\nt/0\n\n7\n\nS\ne\np\n/0\n\n7\n\nA\nu\ng\n/0\n\n7\n\nJ\nu\nl/0\n\n7\n\nJ\nu\nn\n/0\n\n7\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n7\n\nA\np\nr/0\n\n7\n\nM\na\nr/0\n\n7\n\nF\ne\n\nb\n/0\n\n7\n\nJ\na\nn\n/0\n\n7\n\nN\no\nv\n/0\n\n6\n\nD\ne\n\nc\n/0\n\n6\n\nO\nc\nt/0\n\n6\n\nS\ne\np\n/0\n\n6\n\nA\nu\ng\n/0\n\n6\n\nJ\nu\nl/0\n\n6\n\nJ\nu\nn\n/0\n\n6\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n6\n\nA\np\nr/0\n\n8\n\nDrilling Efficiency Benchmark Average\n\nAverage: 96%\nStandard Deviation: 4.6%\n\nEfficiency Historical Benchmark\n\n17.8\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\nO\nc\nt/0\n\n7\n\nS\ne\n\np\n/0\n\n7\n\nA\np\n\nr/0\n8\n\nM\na\n\nr/0\n8\n\nF\ne\n\nb\n/0\n\n8\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n/0\n\n8\n\nD\ne\n\nc\n/0\n\n7\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n7\n\nA\nu\n\ng\n/0\n\n7\n\nJ\nu\n\nl/0\n7\n\nJ\nu\n\nn\n/0\n\n7\n\nM\na\n\ny\n/0\n\n7\n\nA\np\n\nr/0\n7\n\nM\na\n\nr/0\n7\n\nF\ne\n\nb\n/0\n\n7\n\nJ\na\n\nn\n/0\n\n7\n\nS\ne\n\np\n/0\n\n6\n\nA\nu\n\ng\n/0\n\n6\n\nJ\nu\n\nl/0\n6\n\nJ\nu\n\nn\n/0\n\n6\n\nM\na\n\ny\n/0\n\n6\n\nO\nc\nt/0\n\n6\n\nD\ne\n\nc\n/0\n\n6\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n6\n\nAverage: 17.8\nStandard Deviation: 16%\n\nDay Margin Historical Benchmark\n\nRig B1 ADM\n\nRig B1 DM\n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nEfficiency uncertainty: \n\nAs illustrated in Figure 5.5, efficiency may behave as a mean reverting variable. Using the \n\nprocedure described by Copeland and Antokarov (2003), the formula for this variable should \n\nbe: \n\n Vt=Vt-?t +? (V - Vt-?t) +?dz , where: \n\nV is the average level in which the uncertainty fluctuates, in the case was used 94% as the \n\noriginal business case; the same assumption for the original case and a little lower than the \n\nbenchmark in Figure 5.5. ? is the speed of the efficiency return to average after every \n\ndeviation, in this case it was assumed 3 periods or 100% \u00f73 = 33% according to management \n\nestimates and supported by Figure 5.5.

With these parameters, we can incorporate the formula: \n\n Vt=Vt-?t +? (V - Vt-?t) +?dz into the Monte Carlo simulation. \n\nDay Margin Uncertainty: \n\nObserving Figure 5.6, the day margin may also be a mean reverting variable during the 18-\n\nmonth period and should also be in the long run to guarantee the profitability of the industry \n\nand the availability of the services. However, in the short period under a contracted tariff, the \n\nvolatility should be significantly smaller. Using the procedure described by Copeland  and \n\nAntokarov (2003) , I performed the same analysis of the efficiency, but considering one range \n\nfor the 18-month contract and another for the remaining 98 months. \n\nThe average level around the uncertainty fluctuates; in the case it is 17.7, the same assumption \n\nof the original case and a little lower than the benchmark in Figure 5.6. ? is the speed the \n\nefficiency return to average after every deviation, in this case it was assumed that 2 periods or \n\n100% \u00f72 = 50% according to management estimates and supported by Figure 5.6 for the 18-\n\nmonth period and 12 periods or 100% \u00f712 = 8.3% for the remaining 98 months.  Applying the \n\nvolatility formula for the 18-month period considering management estimanates of lowest \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\npossible value with a 95% confidence in 18 months (period of the base contract) is $10,000; \n\nthe value of ? is 3.37 or 18.9%. Using the same volatility formula for the 98-month period \n\nconsidering management estimates of the lowest possible value with a 95% confidence in 98 \n\nmonths (period of the base contract) is negative 10.0; the value of ? is 5.5 or 31.2%.  \n\nIn order to check the modeling of the uncertainties in the Monte Carlos simulation I \n\nperformed the Monte Carlo simulation for the two variables to check whether they are \n\nconverging to the expected mean (that showed be very close from the ones in the PV analysis). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 Efficiency and Day Margin Histograms from Monte Carlo Simulation \n\nSource: Author\u2019s Calculations \n\nStep 2e: Estimate the volatility of the return based on value \n\nThis simulation in turn allows for estimation of the volatility of the rate of return on the \n\nproject (which, as we shall show later on, is 24.3%)\u2014a number that is different from the \n\nvolatility of the efficiency (5.9%) and from the volatility of the day margin (29.2%), \n\ncalculated directly from the Monte Carlo simulation. In fact, the project volatility is a \n\ncombination of the volatilities from these two risks combined with the economics of the \n\nprojected defined by the remaining assumptions. Even though the other assumptions were not \n\nrandomly simulated in the Monte Carlo model, they can influence the project volatility. For \n\ninstance, if the project had no working capital requirements the project volatility would be \n\nonly 0.8% higher; on the other hand, if it had a monthly fixed cost of $100, regardless of \n\nreducing the PV of the project it would have increased the volatility of the project in 22.4%. \n\n As much market information as possible was used in order to estimate the volatility of the \n\nrate of return on the project. In the absence of a traded twin security that represents the project \n\n(not merely the oil price), the proposed method assumed that the PV of the project without \n\nflexibility, as calculated using classical techniques, is the best estimate of the market price of \n\na hypothetical twin security\u2014one whose cash flows are perfectly correlated with the project \n\nSummary Statistics\n\nAverage 93.8% % 1000 repetitions\n\nSD 5.5% 5.9% 43 seconds\n\nMax 109.1%\n\nMin 77.4%\n\n0.77 0.82 0.87 0.92 0.97 1.02 1.07\n\nEfficiency Histogram\n\nSummary Statistics\n\nAverage 17.721 % 1000 repetitions\n\nSD 5.1814 29.2% 42 seconds\n\nMax 33.316\n\nMin -0.280\n\n-1 4 9 14 19 24 29 34\n\nDay Margin Histogram\n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nitself.  However, it is important to recognize that the inputs, even if subjective in some \n\nrespects, are based on management estimates based on actual data of comparable projects. \n\nPerhaps even more important for managers is that the use of the MAD approach makes it far \n\neasier to perform the \u201creality check\u201d of ensuring that the total project value is equal to the \n\nimplied value of managerial flexibility plus the value of the project without flexibility. The \n\nsearch for a \u201ctwin security\u201d in such a case, without a solid PV analysis and the understanding \n\nof the value of the underlying project it provides, is likely to turn the Real Options method \n\ninto the \u201cblack box\u201d that puts off practitioners (Copeland; Antikarov, 2005). \n\nThe Monte Carlo simulation of the project return was accomplished by running 10,000 \n\nrandom draws of the two risks, efficiency and day margins, as described before in the \n\nspreadsheet. The project return is defined by the formula: ln((PV1+FCF1)/PV0). In this case, \n\nPV1 is the present value of future cash flow generated by the operation without investments \n\nand salvage value (as described in Step 1d) in Year 1 discounted at WACC (from the Monte \n\nCarlo simulation). FCF1 is the nominal cash flow generated in the first month without any \n\ninvestment, rather than working capital, from the Monte Carlo simulation. PV0 is the cash \n\nflow generated by the operation at Year 0 from the standard PV analysis without the Monte \n\nCarlo simulation. \n\nIn order to perform the Monte Carlo simulation efficiently, the add-in program for Excel \n\ndeveloped by Barreto; Howland [s.d.]  was used. The program adds optional simulation \n\ncommands and features to Microsoft Excel.  \n\nThe volatility of the project calculated by this methodology was 24.3%, Figure 5.8. A \n\nsimulation of the NPV of the project was also performed, and it was close to the original NPV \n\nvalues, Figure 5.8, reinforcing the believe in the model integrity. \n\n   \n\nFigure 5.8 Project Return and NPV Histograms from Monte Carlo Simulation \n\nSource: Author\u2019s Calculations \n\nSummary Statistics\n\nAverage -1.9% 10000 repetitions\n\nSD 24.3% 843 seconds\n\nMax 67.7%\n\nMin -194.0%\n\n-1.1 -0.9 -0.7 -0.5 -0.3 -0.1 0.1 0.3 0.5 0.7\n\nProject Return Histogram\n\nSummary Statistics\n\nAverage 9,260      % 10000 repetitions\n\nSD 7,068      76% 1946 seconds\n\nMax 30,629    \n\nMin 11,760-    \n\n-12000 -2000 8000 18000 28000\n\nNPV Histogram\n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nAs mentioned in Step 2b, the uncertainties were separated. The volatility for the first group \n\nwas already calculated by using the Monte Carlo simulation. For the second group, based on \n\nthe operator\u2019s economics, the risk of an economic downturn would make the operator\u2019s \n\nproject unfeasible, also requiring a volatility estimation. In this case, the OFS cash flow is the \n\noperator\u2019s CAPEX and if the operator\u2019s project becomes unfeasible because of a drop in oil \n\nprices, an analysis will be performed to determine if it is worth exercising its put option to \n\ncancel the contract and pay the contract penalty. \n\nThis thesis does not intend to discuss the operators\u2019 economics and rationale for exercising \n\nthis option. On the other hand, it is a relevant option that the OFS gives away to the operators \n\nby the time the contract is signed and should be discounted in the original PV calculation of \n\nthe project. To calculate this option we will use a simplified approach and consider as the \n\nvolatility driver the oil prices\u2019 standard deviation for a similar period, in this case the last 20 \n\nmonths previous the project approval as we believe that this periods will captures the \n\nexpected volatility going forward. \n\nSteps 3 to 5 will be applied twice: first for the second type of uncertainty related to the OFS \n\nclient, the company that hired the OFS and can cancel the contract any time if it faces \n\ndifficulties, and then for the sets of uncertainties related to OFS-related operations (efficiency \n\nand day margin).  This order is important because to model the former type of uncertainties it \n\nthe project value is necessary, and the project value should be calculated after discounting the \n\nembedded put option that the OFS company gives to its clients. This is a cost that reduces the \n\nproject value that will be the base to calculate the impact of the other uncertainties in the total \n\nproject value. The annual risk free discount rate used in both cases was 3.4% in $ dollars \n\nequivalent to a 0.28% monthly rate.  \n\n \n\n5.5 Real Option analysis for Rig O Project \u2013 Operator Perspective \n\n5.5.1 Step 3 Operator: Build Event Tree Based on the Binomial Lattice \n\nStep 3a: Construction of the underlying asset event tree: Estimate the volatility of the return \n\nbased on value \n\nThe underlying asset in the first case is the OFS client project value. The project value is \n\ncomposed by the expected net cash flow the client will receive from oil sales after the wells \n\nare drilled and operational.  This value should be net from the extracting and selling costs and \n\ndiscounted by the initial investment in drilling the wells. This initial investment, CAPEX, is \n\nthe OFS expected cash flow from the contract. To calculate the operator\u2019s project value it \n\nwould require a lot of information from the project that the OFS company does not have. In \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nthis thesis I proposed a simplification that is only possible because what we really want is not \n\nthe operators project value; we want the impact of the operator project\u2019s value variation on the \n\nOFS cash flow. It is known that the operator\u2019s project value is strongly correlated to the oil \n\nprices, and that at the time the operators decide to contract the project they take into \n\nconsideration the current oil price and the investment required to implement the project. It is \n\nassumed that if the project\u2019s expected value substantially fell during the drilling phase due to \n\na sharp drop in the expected oil price the operator will reevaluate if it should continue to \n\ninvest or not. In the case that it stops investing it means that it will cancel the OFS contract \n\nand pay eventual penalties. \n\nIt is assumed that at the time the operator contracts the OFS the expected project value is 100. \n\nBased on that and the estimated volatility of this project, the oil price standard variation, \n\n(24%), the binomial event tree for the first contract (18 months) is calculated in Table 5.7. \n\nThe up and down movements at each step are u =e\n???t\n\n  and d=1/u, where ? is the volatility of \n\nasset returns, oil price, per time increment in the tree and ??t is the length of the time \n\nincrement, in this case is one (Hahn; Brandao; Dyer, 2010). \n\nTable 5.7 Operators (Client E) Project Valuation Binomial Tree  \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s Calculation \n\nWhat we are really interested in is the impact on the OFS project value; we also build the \n\nevent tree for the first contract, which has an PV of  $6,437. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1-Up Movement 1.2712269\n\n2-Down Movement 0.7866416\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n\n0 100.0  127.1  161.6 205.4 261.2 332.0  422.0 536.5   682.0 867.0  1,102.1 1,401.1 1,781.1 2,264.1  2,878.2      3,658.9  4,651.2 #### 7,516.5    \n\n1 78.7    100.0 127.1 161.6 205.4  261.2 332.0   422.0 536.5  682.0    867.0     1,102.1 1,401.1  1,781.1      2,264.1  2,878.2 #### 4,651.2    \n\n2 61.9   78.7   100.0 127.1  161.6 205.4   261.2 332.0  422.0    536.5     682.0    867.0     1,102.1      1,401.1  1,781.1 #### 2,878.2    \n\n3 48.7   61.9   78.7    100.0 127.1   161.6 205.4  261.2    332.0     422.0    536.5     682.0          867.0     1,102.1 #### 1,781.1    \n\n4 -     38.3   48.7    61.9   78.7     100.0 127.1  161.6    205.4     261.2    332.0     422.0          536.5     682.0    867.0    1,102.1    \n\n5 -     -     30.1    38.3   48.7     61.9   78.7    100.0    127.1     161.6    205.4     261.2          332.0     422.0    536.5    682.0       \n\n6 -     -     -      23.7   30.1     38.3   48.7    61.9      78.7       100.0    127.1     161.6          205.4     261.2    332.0    422.0       \n\n7 -     -     -      -     18.6     23.7   30.1    38.3      48.7       61.9      78.7       100.0          127.1     161.6    205.4    261.2       \n\n8 -     -     -      -     -       14.7   18.6    23.7      30.1       38.3      48.7       61.9            78.7       100.0    127.1    161.6       \n\n9 -     -     -      -     -       -     11.5    14.7      18.6       23.7      30.1       38.3            48.7       61.9      78.7      100.0       \n\n10 -     -     -      -     -       -     -      9.1        11.5       14.7      18.6       23.7            30.1       38.3      48.7      61.9         \n\n11 -     -     -      -     -       -     -      -        7.1         9.1        11.5       14.7            18.6       23.7      30.1      38.3         \n\n12 -     -     -      -     -       -     -      -        -         5.6        7.1         9.1              11.5       14.7      18.6      23.7         \n\n13 -     -     -      -     -       -     -      -        -         -        4.4         5.6              7.1         9.1        11.5      14.7         \n\n14 -     -     -      -     -       -     -      -        -         -        -         3.5              4.4         5.6        7.1        9.1           \n\n15 -     -     -      -     -       -     -      -        -         -        -         -              2.7         3.5        4.4        5.6           \n\n16 -     -     -      -     -       -     -      -        -         -        -         -              -         2.1        2.7        3.5           \n\n17 -     -     -      -     -       -     -      -        -         -        -         -              -         -        1.7        2.1           \n\n18 -     -     -      -     -       -     -      -        -         -        -         -              -         -        -        1.3           \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nTable 5.8 OFS Project Valuation Binomial Tree for Base Contract with Client E and  \n\nMonthly % of Cash Flow of Remaining Project Value  \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s Calculation \n\nUnlike the operators project value lattice, which does not \u201cpay divided\u201d along the first 18 \n\nmonths of investment, the OFS contract pays them and the up and down formula should \n\napplied to the present value of the project after the dividend payment. To get to the present \n\nvalue of the project after the dividend payment, we multiplied the current project value by 1- % \n\nof the monthly cash flow to the current value of the project.

Using the same \n\nbackward induction technique that will be used to determine a correct price for the option on \n\nthe asset at time zero, we return to the PV of the OFS first contract by starting from the last \n\nbranch (18,0) and (18,1) (Table 5.10) returning to (0,0) by using the appropriated risk-neutral \n\nprobability as discussed in section 3.6.1. \n\nTable 5.10 OFS Project Valuation Binomial Tree for Base Contract Backward Induction \n\n \n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s Calculation \n\nIn Table 5.10, the last column, 18, is the same as Table 5.8, reflecting that in this kind of \n\nproject, in month 18 the project value is the same as the expected cash flow in the 18\nth\n\n month. \n\nThis will be our starting point for the backward induction. The yellow cell (17,0) reflects the \n\nbackward movement that will continue until cell (0,0). The yellow cell is: 25,584 x Risk \n\nNeutral Prob (up)+15,831 x Risk Neutral Prob (down) + the dividend paid in (17,0) (Table \n\n5.9), 19,791. Cell (0,0) is the final result; as expected, it is the same as the original project \n\nvalue from Table 5.8 reflecting the binomial tree without flexibility.  \n\n \n\n5.5.2 Step 4 Operator: Create Decision Tree \n\nStep 4a: Understand the type of option being modeled: Modeling the value of operator put \n\noption to cancel the OFS contract. \n\nAs discussed before, we assumed that the operator project value on T0 is 100. We also \n\nassumed that its value would change according the oil price volatility. The weakest \n\nassumption that will have to be considered in order to calculate the option value is that the \n\noperator project will be unfeasible if it reduces its value by 50%. When this happens, the \n\noperators will choose between continuing the contract and paying the remaining contract \n\nRisk Neutral Prob (up) 44.6%\n\nRisk Neutral Prob (Down) 55.4%\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18\n\n0 6,437   8,161  7,657 9,569 11,940  16,897  19,917 23,238       26,853  31,031  35,217  39,602   43,685  47,404   49,785        50,147   47,707  39,973  25,584     \n\n1 -       5,050  4,738 5,922 7,389    10,456  12,325 14,380       16,617  19,202  21,792  24,506   27,033  29,334   30,807        31,031   29,522  24,735  15,831     \n\n2 -       -      2,932 3,664 4,572    6,470    7,627   8,898         10,283  11,883  13,485  15,164   16,728  18,152   19,064        19,202   18,268  15,306  9,796       \n\n3 -       -      -     2,267 2,829    4,004    4,719   5,506         6,363    7,353    8,345    9,384     10,351  11,233   11,797        11,882   11,304  9,472    6,062       \n\n4 -       -      -     -     1,751    2,478    2,920   3,407         3,937    4,550    5,164    5,807     6,405    6,951     7,300          7,353     6,995    5,861    3,751       \n\n5 -       -      -     -     -        1,533    1,807   2,109         2,437    2,816    3,195    3,593     3,964    4,301     4,517          4,550     4,329    3,627    2,321       \n\n6 -       -      -     -     -        -        1,118   1,305         1,508    1,742    1,977    2,224     2,453    2,662     2,795          2,816     2,679    2,244    1,436       \n\n7 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       807             933        1,078    1,224    1,376     1,518    1,647     1,730          1,742     1,658    1,389    889          \n\n8 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             577        667        757        851        939       1,019     1,070          1,078     1,026    859       550          \n\n9 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        413        469        527        581       631         662             667        635       532       340          \n\n10 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        -        290        326        360       390         410             413        393       329       211          \n\n11 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        -        -        202        223       241         254             255        243       204       130          \n\n12 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        -        -        -         138       149         157             158        150       126       81            \n\n13 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        -        -        -         -        92           97               98          93         78         50            \n\n14 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        -        -        -         -        -         60               61          58         48         31            \n\n15 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        -        -        -         -        -         -              37          36         30         19            \n\n16 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        -        -        -         -        -         -              -         22         18         12            \n\n17 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        -        -        -         -        -         -              -         -        11         7              \n\n18 -       -      -     -     -        -        -       -             -        -        -        -         -        -         -              -         -        -        5              \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nvalue or canceling the contract and paying the contractual penalty; it will choose the lowest \n\nvalue and make its decision. Once the decision is made, it will generate a new binomial tree \n\nfor the OFS company. The difference between the binomial tree without flexibility (Table \n\n5.10) and the one with the operator\u2019s flexibility to cancel the contract (Table 5.12) will be the \n\nput option value that OFS gives to the client. \n\nTable 5.11 Operator (Client E) Decision Tree Based on Oil Price and Remaining Cash Flow \n\nto be Paid to OFS \n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s Calculation \n\nAccording the OFS contract with Client E, the penalty for early cancelation of the contract is \n\nthe mobilization revenue, about  $2.5 million. Once the operator decision is modeled, we have \n\nto reflect this decision on the OFS project value to calculate the option value. \n\nStep 4b: Can have multiple decisions at one node \n\nDepending on the opportunities, the decision node could have multiple alternatives such as: \n\n?

This means that it will receive this value instead of the \n\nremaining cash flow that it would have received had the project continued.  The difference \n\nfrom the two projects is $0.53 million or 8% of the project value. This is the value of the \n\noption to cancel that OFS gives to the client and should be seen as a cost to be subtracted from \n\nthe original contract PV. The value of this option is entirely owned by the operators as OFS \n\ngives it own its contract and its real value to the operator will depend on its own economics. \n\nIn fact the value that was calculated is the OFS cost on giving this option to the operator.  \n\nTable 5.12 OFS Project Valuation Binomial Tree Backward Induction with Client E \n\nFlexibility to Cancel the Contract. \n\n \n\nSource: Author\u2019s Calculation \n\nA similar approach was taken to obtain the amount required to cancel the new contracts. The \n\nother four contracts are longer (24 months), generating an option to cancel, or cost to the OFS, \n\nvalued at $1.2 million or 14% of the project value. \n\nMore central than calculating the cost of the option was the understanding of the risk involved \n\nin the project caused by a contractual clause\n9\n. By agreeing to such a clause, OFS is more \n\nexposed to the market uncertainty (oil price). By understanding this dynamic, the company \n\ncould be more prepared to negotiate with clients as such drastic events occur. \n\n \n\n5.6 Real Option analysis for Rig O Project \u2013 OFS Perspective   \n\n5.6.1 Step 3 OFS: Build Event Tree Based on the binomial lattice \n\nNow we are going to apply the methodology to the other uncertainties taking into \n\nconsideration the original PV reducing the put option cost that was given to the client. \n\nStep 3a: Construction of the underlying asset event tree \n\nThe underlying asset now is the combination of all contracts\u2019 expected cash flows.

pays \u201cdivided\u201d throughout the 117 months of the contract, the up and down formula \n\nshould be applied to the present value of the project after the dividend payment. To ascertain \n\nthe present value of the project after the dividend payment, we multiplied the current project \n\nvalue by the % of the month cash flow to the current value of the project. See section 3.6.4 for \n\ndetails. \n\nStep 3b: Models dividends payment \n\nAccording to Brand\u00e3o; Dyer; Hahn (2005), to simplify the binomial tree and allow a easier \n\nunderstanding of the variables that are being modeled, we separate the dividend payment of \n\nthe project; in this case the expected monthly cash flow from the project value. We also \n\ndiscount the dividend payment using the risk-free interest rate (Table 5.14). \n\nStep 3c: Ensure no arbitrage with underlying and risk-free bond; event tree should reduce to \n\nPV \n\nAt this point, we are still modeling the binomial tree without any flexibility. Using the same \n\nbackward induction technique that will be used to determine a correct price for the option on \n\nthe asset at time zero, we return to the PV of the OFS PV of cash flow by starting from the \n\nlast branch (117,0) and (117,1) of Table 5.13 and returning to (0,0) by using the appropriated \n\nrisk-neutral probability as discussed on section 3.5.2.  \n\nIn Table 5.15, the last column, 117, is the same as in Table 5.14, reflecting that in this kind of \n\nproject in Month 117 the project value is the same as the expected cash flow in the 117\nth\n\n \n\nmonth, which will be our starting point for the backward induction.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\nTable 5.14 OFS Discounted Cash Flow (Dividends Payments) Binomial Tree for the Project. \n\n \n\n \nSource: Author\u2019s

\n\ncontract. At the end of the contract with Client E, after Contracts I and II the OFS has the \n\noption to enter into a new contract with the same or a new client, and either wait until the \n\nmarket improves or sell the rig for the current liquidation value. If the OFS decides to enter \n\ninto a new contract, it has a small maintenance CAPEX to incur. After almost five years the \n\nOFS has an additional option of investing in addition of the maintenance CAPEX  $1 for \n\nupdating the rig or accepting a reduction of 30% on the day margin and consequently the cash \n\nflow. At the end of Contract III if it did not choose to update it will have to continue with \n\nlower margins. After almost 10 years, if the O rig was not sold yet it will be sold for a \n\nliquidation value similar to the original business case. Using this approach, we are able to \n\nobtain the total project value during the period of the projections without the need to calculate \n\nany terminal value for cash flow projections. \n\nStep 4b: Can have multiple decisions at one node \n\nThe fourth step adds the options to the event tree, transforming it into a decision tree like the \n\none shown in Figure 5.9 This is the case of a compound option; there are as many decision \n\ntrees as there are compound options. To calculate the value of each option, different binomial \n\nlattice trees were calculated: \n\nFlexibility to do not contract (A) at the end of each contract and wait for better margins; in \n\nthis case it is not necessary to invest in maintaiance CAPEX; \n\nFlexibility to do not contract (A) + To be able to continue contracting with lower margins \n\nand without incurring the update CAPEX (B); \n\nA+B+ To sell the rig for liquidation value at the end of each contract (C). \n\nIn addition to this binomial lattice, one lattice more was performed only with the option to sell \n\nfor liquidation value. \n\n5.6.3 Step 5 OFS: Estimate Value of Real Option \n\nStep 5a: Solution provides decisions as well as a value \n\nUsing the similar backward induction technique described before, first it was calculate the \n\noption to do not contract Table 5.16. This option should be exercised when the expected cash \n\nflow from the current client is lower than the required investment (maintenance CAPEX) \n\nadded to the option to cancel that OFS awards its clients. As OFS has the option to offer \n\nservice latter if the market improves it is also necessary to model this contract separately.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\nNote that at this point it was incorporated the following variables in the binomial lattice: \n\n? At the last nodes, column 117 considers the dividend paid on 117 month (cash flow \n\ngenerated by the operation) and the proceeds from the sale of the rig for liquidation \n\nvalued estimated on 4.8 million at month 117; \n\n? In the white cells, consideration of the regular backward induction mechanism is \n\nillustrated: e.g., (116,0) = (117,0) x Risk Neutral Prob (up) + (117,1) x Risk Neutral \n\nProb (down) + the dividend paid in Table 5.14 (116,0); \n\nIn the green cells, the months in which the European option can be exercised, the option was \n\nmodeled as: \n\n? Month 94: the maximum between investing the required CAPEX, less the put option \n\nthat OFS offered the client (option to cancel the contract) plus the backward induction \n\nrepresenting the value of future cash flows (enter in a new contract), and doing \n\nnothing and selling for liquidation value the rig in Month 117. Note that by entering \n\ninto a new contract the backward induction in the last nodes guarantee that it will also \n\nreceive the liquidation value of the rig. \n\n? Month 69: the maximum between investing the required CAPEX, less the put option \n\nthat OFS offered the client (option to cancel the contract) plus the backward induction \n\nrepresenting the value of future cash flows (enter in a new contract), and doing \n\nnothing during the following 24 months but having the option to enter into a new \n\ncontract in Month 94. Note that the impact of being able to contract again is calculated \n\nby using the same formula of the previous choice but subtracting the value of the \n\nbinomial tree from Table 5.20, which is the same binomial tree but without the new \n\nContract IV cash flow. \n\n? Month 44: the maximum between investing the required CAPEX, less the put option \n\nthat OFS offered the client (option to cancel the contract) plus the backward induction \n\nrepresenting the value of future cash flows (enter in a new contract), and doing \n\nnothing during the next 24 months, but having the option to enter in a new contract in \n\nMonth 69. Note that the impact of being able to contract again is calculated by using \n\nthe same formula of the previous choice but subtracting the value of the binomial tree \n\nfrom Table 5.21 that is the same binomial tree but without new Contracts III and IV.   \n\n? Month 19: the maximum between investing the required CAPEX, less the put option \n\nthat OFS offered the client (option to cancel the contract) plus the backward induction \n\nrepresenting the value of future cash flows (enter in a new contract), and doing \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nnothing during the next 24 months, but having the option to enter in a new contract in \n\nMonth 44. Note that the impact of being able to contract again is calculated by using \n\nthe same formula of the previous choice but subtracting the value of the binomial tree \n\nfrom Table 5.22 that is the same binomial tree but without new Contracts II, III and IV.   \n\nThe result was exhibited in Table 5.16, $30.3 million. Comparing this value with the value of \n\nthe project without flexibility in Table 5.13 27.7 million. The value of the option of not \n\nentering into new contracts if the situation is not favorable is calculated to be $2.6 million. \n\nA this point a new variable was added to the option calculation: the option not to invest in \n\nupdating the rig in Month 69. Table 5.17 shows the new binomial tree. The only differences \n\nfrom the tree in Table 5.16 is that in the Month 69 column in blue, the maximum formula \n\nshould also contain the option to reduce the investment by $1 million with the value that \n\ncomes from the backward induction representing the future cash flows from the subsequent \n\ncontracts being reduced by 30%. Comparing this value with the value of the project with \n\nflexibility only to not enter into a new contract in Table 5.16, $30.3 million, the additional \n\nvalue of the option of reducing tariffs (reducing the day margin) but not to invest on updating \n\nthe rig is calculated, resulting in an additional value of $0.4 million. \n\nFinally the most valuable option was incorporated, which, as we will see, is the option to sell \n\nthe rig for its liquidation value at the end of each contract. The same formulas from the \n\npreviously binomial lattice were used, but incorporating the value of the liquidation value as \n\nan additional option in the maximum formula, in the green or blue columns, at end of each \n\ncontract. This value is compared with the previous project in Table 5.17: $30.7 million. The \n\nadditional value of the option of selling the rig for liquidation value is calculated to be $1.2 \n\nmillion. However, unlike the previous option that was built on the option of not entering into \n\na new contract, this option and decision is independent from the others and has the potential to \n\noffset the flexibility added by the other option. In order to better understand its dynamics we \n\nimplemented an additional binomial lattice only with the flexibility to sell the rig for \n\nliquidation value. As we can see on Table 5.19, it has the same value of the project with all of \n\nthe other options. The option to sell Rig O for liquidation value is dominant over the other \n\noptions. From a numerical perspective of this framework, all other options could be \n\neliminated, but in the last one, the project would have the same numerical value. However, if \n\nyou take into consideration the business perspective it is very different: the option of selling \n\nthe rig could not be accessible for instance if it were pledged in a credit agreement or any \n\nother restriction appears. The liquidation value could also be misestimated or the market for \n\nthis kind of rig could become less liquid. Another import aspect of having additional options \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\neven though it does not represent any additional value for the project value is the fact that by \n\nhaving the option mapped, managers could be more aware of the project value drivers and act \n\non the levers in order to maximize the project value throughout its life. \n\n  \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nTable 5.16 OFS Project

Figure 5.10, the project valuation with all real options is 8.7 million. This \n\nvalue is formed by: \n\n? All contracts expected cash flow totaling 29.5 million; \n\n? All CAPEX investments (22.9) million; \n\n? The salvage value of the end of the project (rig liquidation value) 2.7 million; \n\nThe first components of the tree combined is the project traditional NPV without any \n\nflexibility and static, 9.3 million. \n\n Including the real options: \n\n? Cost of the option to cancel the contract awarded to Client E, (0.5) million; \n\n? Cost of the option to cancel the new assumed contracts to be awarded to the new \n\ncontracts expected to be signed (4.2) million; \n\n? The option to be able to not invest on maintenance and updating CAPEX and not \n\nenter in a new contract waiting for better tariffs (expected cash flow) to improve \n\n2.6 million; \n\n? Option to be able to work with lower tariffs in Month 69, before entering in \n\ncontract 3 and not investing on updating the rig 0.5 million; \n\n? Option to sell the rig for liquidation value that has a marginal impact of 1.2 million \n\nconsidering the previous options; or 4.2 million considering it by itself. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.10 Project Valuation Breakdown with all Real Options \n\nSource: Author\u2019s Calculation \n\n2.6\n\nCost of the \n\nOp tion to \n\nCancel (PV)\n\n4.7\n\n4.2\n\n0.5\n\nNPV\n\n9.3\n\nPV Salvage \n\nValue\n\n2.7\n\nBase Contract \n\n(Client E)\n\n22.9\n\nPV Cash \n\nFlows \n\n(op eration)\n\n29.5\n\n4.0\n\n5.2\n\n6.3\n\n7.6\n\n6.4\n\n-6%\n\nNew contract 4\n\nNew contract 3\n\nNew contract 2\n\nNew contract 1\n\nProject \n\nValue \n\nwith RO\n\n8.7\n\nPV \n\nInvestments\n\nOp tion to \n\nSell for \n\nLiquidation \n\nValue*\n\n1.2\n\nOp tion to \n\nReduce \n\nTariffs\n\n0.5\n\nOp tion Not \n\nto Work\n\nBase Contract\n\nNew Contracts\n\nProject Valuation Breakdown\n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.11 Project Valuation Breakdown with Dominant Real Options \n\nSource: Author\u2019s Calculation \n\nUnlike several Real Options examples and case studies in which the Real Option analysis \n\nincreases the project value compared to the NPV approach, this one reduces. By incorporating \n\nthe cost of the put option that OFS puts forth for the client it reduces the value by giving \n\nflexibility to its clients it is a similar impacted described by Copeland and Weston, (1982) on \n\ntheir note on the evaluation of cancellable operating leases.  By incorporating some options \n\nbrought by the OFS management, flexibility to act, it partially offset the project value \n\nreduction.  \n\n \n\n5.8 Retrospective Analysis of Rig O Investment Project \n\nIt would be easy to criticize the investment decision having the advantage of hindsight; \n\nhowever, this exercise tried to examine the decisions through the lens of that period. As \n\npreviously discussed, the original business plan had serious flaws and was revised (Figure \n\n5.12). The Real Options analysis valuation had results similar to those of the original business \n\ncase; with that in mind, the actual results are presented below. \n\nAs it was a 10-year project valuation, and it has only been 4 years and 4 months since the \n\nproject started, we have to consider the following assumptions: \n\n? 53 months of operation and 14 more months with the latest company projections for \n\nthe rig O were considered actual results; \n\n? For the remaining months the same projection of the revised business case was used;  \n\n? The same discount rate was considered; \n\n-6%\n\nProject Value \n\nwith RO\n\n8.7\n\nOption to Sell for \n\nLiquidation Value\n\n4.2\n\nCost of Option \n\nto Cancel (PV)\n\n4.7\n\nNPV\n\n9.3\n\nProject Valuation Breakdown with Dominant RO\n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\n?

The higher costs also affected the value of the \n\nproject as described in Figure 5.13 but in a bullish market, OFS companies generally are able \n\nto pass it through tariffs. \n\nThe biggest impact was that the market abruptly changed in the years after the investment was \n\napproved in mid 2008. \n\nThe global financial crisis led to sharp decreases in oil prices (Figure 5.14), reducing the oil \n\nprice by 47% from the period the project was approved to the beginning of operations. The \n\nfinancial crisis also decreased the drilling demand and that, combined with the high level of \n\ncompetition in Colombia, generated an oversupply of rigs, resulting in downward pricing \n\npressure on OFS companies\u2019 rates. \n\nEven though the client E shares were strongly impacted, at a 44% reduction from the peak \n\n(Figure 5.15), the client did not cancel the contract, but pressured OFS to reduce the tariffs.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.14 Price Evolution: Prior to and after the Investment was Approved. \n\nSource: Bloomberg \n\n \n\n83\n\n66\n\n109\n\n91\n\n132\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\nF\ne\nb\n/0\n\n7\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/0\n7\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n6\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n6\n\n-47%\n87\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/1\n1\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/1\n1\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n1\n1\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/1\n1\n\nM\na\ny\n/1\n\n1\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n1\n1\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n1\n1\n\nF\ne\nb\n/1\n\n1\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/1\n1\n\nD\ne\nc\n/1\n\n0\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/1\n\n0\n\nO\nc\nt/\n1\n0\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/1\n0\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/1\n0\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n1\n0\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/1\n0\n\nM\na\ny\n/1\n\n0\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n1\n0\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n1\n0\n\nF\ne\nb\n/1\n\n0\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/1\n0\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n9\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n9\n\nO\nc\nt/\n0\n9\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/0\n9\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/0\n9\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n0\n9\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/0\n9\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n9\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n9\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n0\n9\n\nF\ne\nb\n/0\n\n9\n\n65\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/0\n9\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n8\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n8\nO\n\nc\nt/\n0\n8\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/0\n8\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/0\n8\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n0\n8\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/0\n8\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n8\n\n121\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n8\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n0\n8\n\nF\ne\nb\n/0\n\n8\nJ\na\nn\n\n/0\n8\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n7\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n7\n\nO\nc\nt/\n0\n7\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/0\n7\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/0\n7\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n0\n7\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/0\n7\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n7\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n7\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n0\n7\n\nM\na\ny\n/1\n\n2\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n1\n2\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n1\n2\n\nF\ne\nb\n/1\n\n2\nJ\na\nn\n\n/1\n2\n\nD\ne\nc\n/1\n\n1\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/1\n\n1\n\nO\nc\nt/\n1\n1\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/1\n2\n\n84\n\nOil Prices\n\nBefore Invest\n\nAfter the Invest\nBefore After Total\n\nAverage 80.6         90.0        87.3     \n\nStandar Deviation 24.2% 14.7% 18.1%\n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 5.15 Client E Share Price Evolution \n\nSource: Bloomberg \n\nAs a whole, the OFS Colombian results degraded from the peak right after the investment was \n\napproved (Figure 5.16).

The options not to enter into a new contract or to sell \n\nthe rig for liquidation value are still open and should be exercised if the expected future cash \n\nflow further deteriorates.  \n\nCliet E Share Price10099\n\n87\n\n75\n\n9194 90\n\n63\n\n71\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/0\n7\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/0\n7\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n0\n7\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/0\n7\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n7\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n0\n7\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n7\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n6\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/0\n7\n\nF\ne\nb\n/0\n\n7\n\n-44%\n\n56\nD\n\ne\nc\n/0\n\n7\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n7\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n0\n8\n\nO\nc\nt/\n0\n8\n\nO\nc\nt/\n0\n7\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n8\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n8\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n8\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/0\n8\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n0\n8\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/0\n8\n\n85\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/0\n8\n\nF\ne\nb\n/0\n\n8\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/0\n8\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n6\n\nM\na\ny\n/1\n\n0\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n1\n0\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n1\n0\n\nF\ne\nb\n/1\n\n0\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/1\n0\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n9\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/0\n\n9\n\nO\nc\nt/\n0\n9\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/0\n9\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/0\n9\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n0\n9\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/0\n9\n\nM\na\ny\n/0\n\n9\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n0\n9\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n0\n9\n\nF\ne\nb\n/0\n\n9\n\n60\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/0\n9\n\nD\ne\nc\n/0\n\n8\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n1\n1\n\nM\na\ny\n/1\n\n1\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/1\n1\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n1\n1\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/1\n1\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/1\n1\n\n64\n\nO\nc\nt/\n1\n1\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/1\n\n1\n\nD\ne\nc\n/1\n\n1\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/1\n2\n\nF\ne\nb\n/1\n\n2\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n1\n2\n\nA\np\n\nr/\n1\n2\n\nM\na\ny\n/1\n\n2\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/1\n2\n\nM\na\nr/\n\n1\n1\n\nJ\nu\nl/\n1\n0\n\nA\nu\ng\n\n/1\n0\n\nS\ne\np\n\n/1\n0\n\nO\nc\nt/\n1\n0\n\nN\no\n\nv\n/1\n\n0\n\nF\ne\nb\n/1\n\n1\n\nJ\na\nn\n\n/1\n1\n\nD\ne\nc\n/1\n\n0\n\nJ\nu\nn\n\n/1\n0\n\n49\n\n63\n\nAfter the Invest\n\nBefore Invest\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n9\n\n1\nQ\n\n1\n0\n\n2\nQ\n\n1\n0\n\n3\nQ\n\n1\n0\n\n4\nQ\n\n1\n0\n\n1\nQ\n\n1\n1\n\n2\nQ\n\n1\n1\n\n3\nQ\n\n1\n1\n\n4\nQ\n\n1\n1\n\n1\nQ\n\n1\n2\n\n2\nQ\n\n1\n2\n\nCAGR: -6%\n\nCAGR: +9%\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n5\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n5\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n5\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n6\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n6\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n6\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n6\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n7\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n7\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n7\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n7\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n8\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n8\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n8\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n8\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n9\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n9\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n9\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n4\n\n2\nQ\n\n0\n4\n\n3\nQ\n\n0\n4\n\n4\nQ\n\n0\n4\n\n1\nQ\n\n0\n5\n\nAfter the Invest\n\nBefore Invest\n\nOFS Colombia Quarterly EBITDA\n\n\n\n76 \n\n \n\n6  CONCLUSION \n\n6.1 Challenges of the Real Option Methodology \n\nAccording to Block (2007), in the survey with 279 Fortune 1000 companies, only 14.3% used \n\nReal Options in the capital budget process in contrast with the majority using NPV analysis.  \n\nThus, despite being recommended by academics and experts, the practical application of Real \n\nOptions in organizations is still meager.  According to Lander and Pinches (1998), the main \n\nbarriers for wider adoption are (1) the types of models are not well known or understood by \n\ncorporate managers; (2) the required modeling assumptions are often violated in a practical \n\nReal Options application; and (3) additional assumptions required limits the scope of \n\napplicability.  Several authors have also developed simplified approaches and methodologies \n\nto try to open the Real Options black box (Copeland; Tufano, 2004).  Recent literature, \n\ninformed by several case studies in different areas, has helped bring together academics and \n\npractitioners to overcome these challenges.  \n\nHowever, most companies are still far from the correct application of the traditional NPV \n\nmethodology. As shown in the case study, important projects are still being approved without \n\ncomprehensive discussions of their main assumptions. In the case analyzed, the company \n\nover-simplified some assumptions or economic dynamics that could be better modeled \n\nbringing more precise results. Before going further in the use of Real Options, the company \n\nshould revise its internal decision-making process and ensure that the results are being \n\ncalculated with all information available, not only the ones given to the financial analysts. \n\nThe Real Option methodology will not solve the problems of poor assumption or \n\noverconfident estimates. However, it could better reflect the reality and the flexibility \n\ninvolved in the project: the flexibility of the company acting to solve problems, but at the \n\nsame time the flexibility for its clients to cancel contracts. This was the situation in case study. \n\nBy subtracting from the NPV the cost of the put option, it discounted the project value \n\nreflecting possible economic downturn as it actually happened.  \n\n \n\n6.2 \u201cThe journey not the arrival matters.\u201d \u2013 T. S. Eliot \n\nAs discussed before in section 5.7, the project value with the revised NPV and the NPV added \n\nthe Real Options had similar values. The option to sell for the liquidation value is dominant to \n\nthe other two options, so why take the trouble of calculating the all the options? \n\nThe answer lies on the understanding that the most important point of Real Option valuation \n\nis not the results, but how one arrives at them. Unlike a static NPV analysis in which after the \n\nproject value is calculated and the project is approved or not, the Real Option valuation \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\nrequires and supports the monitoring of the project. By understanding how the options are \n\ncreated, management can make better decisions about the project after it was approved, \n\nexercising its option or not.  Even the projects that were not approved might be feasible if \n\ncertain circumstances change. By performing the analysis, the option dynamics are mapped \n\nand its values drivers explored, helping to identify possible opportunities and threats for the \n\nproject and allow management to act in time to increase the project value. \n\nAs a finance professional, I answer yes to the research question. Real Options can be used in \n\nreal-world organizations, not only in academia. The case study showed how valuable it can be \n\nespecially to price contractual clauses that typically companies give to clients at no charge. \n\nHowever, there is still a long way to go in making the methodology more practical to use. The \n\ncase study also showed that there was no single framework that fits all organizations\u2019 needs or \n\ntypes of investment projects. The framework should be customized to calculate a specific \n\noption or investment project. It is still far from being a simple framework for all organizations.    \n\n \n\n6.3 Future Studies \n\nFuture studies could explore the following approaches of this theme: \n\n? Analyze the case through the lens of Behavioral Economics and the common biases of \n\ncapital budgeting process as overconfidence of managers\u2019 projection and hindsight; \n\n? Retroactively evaluate if one of the options (not to enter into the contract or sell for \n\nsalvage value) should have been exercised; \n\n? Perform the same analysis for Rig G project, a similar project approved during the \n\nsame time period \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\n7  REFERENCES  \n\nADNER, R.; LEVINTHAL, D. A.
