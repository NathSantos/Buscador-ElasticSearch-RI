In the intraoperative period, there are significant variations in blood volume, body temperature, \nplasma composition, and tissue blood flow, in addition to activation of inflammation, with important consequences. Serial \nmeasurements of blood glucose levels can indicate states of exacerbation of the neuroendocrine-metabolic response to \ntrauma, serving as prognostic markers of morbidity in that population.\n\nObjective: To correlate perioperative blood glucose levels of children undergoing cardiac surgery with the occurrence of \npostoperative complications, and to compare intraoperative blood glucose levels according to perioperative conditions.\n\nMethods: Information regarding the surgical/anesthetic procedure and perioperative conditions of patients was collected from \nthe medical records. The mean perioperative blood glucose levels in the groups of patients with and without postoperative \ncomplications and the frequencies of perioperative conditions were compared by use of odds ratio and non-parametric \nunivariate analyses. \n\nResults: Higher intraoperative blood glucose levels were observed in individuals who had postoperative complications. \nPrematurity, age group, type of anesthesia, and character of the procedure did not influence the mean intraoperative blood \nglucose level. The use of extracorporeal circulation (ECC) was associated with higher blood glucose levels during surgery. \nIn procedures with ECC, higher blood glucose levels were observed in individuals who had infectious and cardiovascular \ncomplications. In surgeries without ECC, that association was observed with infectious and hematological complications.\n\nConclusion: Higher intraoperative blood glucose levels are associated with higher morbidity in the postoperative period of \npediatric cardiac surgery.(Arq Bras Cardiol 2011;97(5):372-379)\n\nKeywords: Heart defects, congenital; thoracic surgery; postoperative complications; blood glucose.\n\nMailing Address: Rodrigo Leal Alves \u2022  \nRua Sargento Astrol\u00e1bio, 209, apt 1202, Ed.

The interpretation and management of such \nalterations, however, are adaptations of conclusions and \ngeneralized observations without the appropriate pediatric \nconfirmation. The present study aimed at analyzing \nperioperative blood glucose levels of children undergoing \nlow- and moderate-risk cardiac surgery, and at comparing \nthem according to surgical/anesthetic conditions and the \noccurrence of infectious, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, \nneurological, and hematological complications, and of death \nin the postoperative period.\n\nMethods\nAfter approval by the Committee on Ethics and Medical \n\nResearch, 160 consecutive cardiac surgeries performed in \ndifferent children aged up to 16 years at the S\u00e3o Rafael \nand Ana Neri hospitals in the city of Salvador (state of \nBahia), in the years 2007 and 2008, were retrospectively \nstudied. All type 1, 2, and 3 procedures according to the \nRisk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) \nscore were selected for the study11. \n\nThe perioperative variables were collected in a \nstandardized sheet with information regarding demographic \ndata, preoperative conditions, type and complexity of \nthe procedure performed, type of anesthesia, use and \nduration of ECC, and use of blood components. All \npatients underwent arterial catheterization for continuous \nmeasurement of arterial blood pressure, and samples \nwere collected at least twice in the intraoperative period \n(right after arterial catheterization and at the end of the \nprocedure) and at the surgical/anesthetic team\u2019s discretion. \nDiuresis, insensitive losses, and the volume of crystalloids \nand colloids administered were computed in the final \ncalculation of fluid balance, and the weight of surgical pads \nand gauzes, aspirated volume, estimated loss in the ECC \ncircuit, and volume of blood components administered \nwere used in blood balance.\n\nRegarding preoperative conditions, the following data \nwere collected: gender; age; prematurity; weight; primary \ncardiopathy (with greater clinical impact on the child); \nassociated diseases (including secondary cardiopathies); \npresence of cyanosis; pulmonary hypertension; congestive \nheart failure or mechanical ventilation prior to surgery; \nand character of the procedure (elective or emergency). In \naddition, the last preoperative laboratory exams, including \nfasting blood glucose levels, were also assessed.\n\nDuring surgery, the following data regarding the \nsurgical/anesthetic act were collected: type of anesthesia \n(general anesthesia alone x general anesthesia with spinal \nanesthesia); surgery performed; ECC data; administration \nof blood components; use of vasoactive drugs, insulin \nand corticosteroids; and administration of glucose at any \nform or dilution. The laboratory exams of the period were \n\nperformed in an automate blood gas analyzer (Radiometer \nMedical ABL 700, Copenhagen) of the same brand and \nmodel in both hospitals studied, with blood sample \ncollected from the invasive arterial blood pressure system \nor from the arterial line of ECC. The mentioned blood gas \nanalyzer measures not only the blood gas profile of the \nsample (pH, PCO\n\n2\n, PO\n\n2\n, HCO\n\n3\n-, and BE), but also blood \n\nglucose levels, erythrogram (hematocrit and hemoglobin), \nlactatemia, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, \nand chloride). Because of the large variability in the \nnumber and time of intraoperative samplings, the initial \nand maximum blood glucose levels were recorded during \nsurgery, as was the mean of the blood glucose levels \ncollected during the period. \n\nIn the postoperative period, the occurrence of death \nand complications was assessed based on the report of \nevents in the medical record until the patient\u2019s discharge \nfrom hospital. The types of complications were recorded \nin correlate groups according to the following pre -\nestablished definitions: infections: confirmed situations \nor suspicion of infected site with the use of antibiotics; \ncardiovascular complications: occurrence of arrhythmias, \ntotal atrioventricular block, cardiac tamponade, use \nof vasoactive drug for more than 24 hours (infusions \ngreater than 15 \u00b5g/kg/min of dopamine or any value of \ncontinuous infusion of noradrenaline and/or adrenaline), \ninotropic drug use for more than 24 hours (infusions up \nto 15 \u00b5g/kg/min of dopamine or any value of continuous \ninfusion of dobutamine or milrinone), low cardiac output, \nand systemic arterial hypertension requiring sodium \nnitroprusside for blood pressure control for more than 24 \nhours; respiratory complications: embolism, pulmonary \nedema, mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours \nin the postoperative period, and acute pulmonary injury; \nrenal complications: acute renal failure (elevation greater \nthan or equal to twice the baseline creatinine serum level) \nand/or dialysis need; neurological complications: coma, \nconvulsion, neurological deficit, and stroke; hematological \ncomplications: coagulopathy (prothrombin and activated \npartial thromboplastin times greater than twice the normal \nvalue or fibrinogen lower than 100 mg/dL and/or platelet \ncount lower than 80,000/mm3), hemorrhagic events with or \nwithout coagulopathy and need to return to the operating \nroom for hemostasis review. A combined event was the \noccurrence of at least one of the complications listed. \n\nIn the intensive care units (ICUs), the routine measurements \nof postoperative blood glucose levels obtained with digital \nglucometers (reagent strip \u2013 glucose oxidase method) were \nassessed. The values on admission and the mean value of \nthe measures obtained on the first postoperative day were \nused in the analysis, because of the variation in measurement \ntimes (performed at least four times a day). The ICUs in \nthe hospitals studied had a routine of at least 24-hour oral \nfasting after surgery with glucose administration (infusion rate \nbetween 5 and 10 mg/kg/minute) in the intravenous solution \nof hydro-electrolyte replacement during that period. Insulin \ntherapy to control glycemia was used at the discretion of the \nphysician in charge, being usually initiated in the presence \nof blood glucose levels over 250mg/dL. \n\n373\n\n\n\nOriginal Article\n\nArq Bras Cardiol 2011;97(5):372-379\n\nAlves et al\nBlood glucose level and complications in pediatric surgery\n\nThe values of initial, maximum and average intraoperative \nand preoperative blood glucose, as well as the average of the \nvalues of the 1st postoperative day of patients who had or \nnot complications were compared using the Mann-Whitney \ntest. The effect of intraoperative blood glucose average on \nthe chance of complications was calculated by binary logistic \nregression, adjusted according to the estimated risk (RACHS-1), \nand values were expressed as odds ratio with confidence \nintervals of 95%. The different mean intraoperative blood \nglucose levels according to prematurity, type of anesthesia, \nsurgery character, and use of ECC were compared by use of \nthe Mann-Whitney test. The mean intraoperative blood glucose \nlevels according to age group and risk group were compared \nby use of Kruskal-Wallis test. The chi-square test was used to \ncompare the relative frequencies of ECC use and complication \nrates according to risk groups. Effects and differences were \nconsidered statistically significant when p &lt;0.05. \n\nResults\nOf the 160 patients studied, 85 were of the male sex (75 \n\nfemales), 90 had another associated disease, and only five \nwere premature babies. Median age and weight were 36 \nmonths and 13 kg, respectively, with a large variation range \nin sampling (15 days to 16 years, and 2.3 to 67 kg of weight). \nMost procedures (81% of the cases) were considered elective, \ngeneral anesthesia alone being the most commonly used \nanesthetic procedure (76.8%) as compared to combined \nanesthesia (general plus spinal anesthesia). Extracorporeal \ncirculation was used in approximately half of the surgeries \n(48%), with a median duration of 70 minutes and median \naortic clamping time of 55 minutes. In 62.5% of the cases, \ntransfusion of any type of blood components was required, \nand the patients had a median intraoperative diuresis of 3.67 \nmL.kg-1 and median fluid and blood balances of +140 mL and \n+20 mL, respectively. The preoperative use of corticosteroid \nand the intraoperative administration of glucose or insulin were \nuncommon events in our sampling. Because of the surgical \nprotocol of methylprednisolone use (30mg/kg) in ECC, the \nintraoperative corticoid administration rate was identical to the \nECC use rate (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nGraph 1 shows the evolution of blood glucose levels at \ndifferent times in the perioperative period in patients with \nand without at least one of the previously listed complications \n(combined event). A statistically significant difference is \nobserved in the maximum and mean blood glucose levels in \nthe intraoperative period, with higher levels being observed in \nthose evolving with a morbid event. Because the mean blood \nglucose level obtained from all samples during surgery probably \nbetter reflects the metabolic status than the unitary measures \nof blood glucose peak in that period, we chose to analyze its \nassociation with postoperative complications and the impact \nof possible confounding variables on it. \n\nTables 3 and 4 show that prematurity, surgery character, \ntype of anesthesia, and age group were not associated with \ndifferences in the mean blood glucose level during surgery. \nExtracorporeal circulation, with the concomitant administration \nof high doses of corticosteroid, however, was associated with \nsignificantly higher blood glucose levels in the period (Table 4). \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Demographic data and anesthetic and surgical conditions \nin the intraoperative period\n\nVariable Values\n\nAge (months) 36 (8 / 96) \n\nWeight (kg) 13 (6.23 / 22.15) \n\nGender Male - 85 (53%)\n\nPrematurity Premature \u2013 5 (3%)\n\nCyanosis Yes \u2013 48 (30%)\n\nIncreased pulmonary flow Yes \u2013 97 (61%)\n\nCongestive heart failure Yes \u2013 72 (45%)\n\nAssociated disease Yes \u2013 90 (56%)\n\nCharacter of surgery Elective \u2013 130 (81%)\n\nType of anesthesia General - 123 (76.8 %)\n\nExtracorporeal circulation use 77 (48.1%)\n\nIntraoperative transfusion 100 (62.5%)\n\nIntraoperative glucose administration 6 (3.8%)\n\nIntraoperative insulin administration  13 (8.1%)\n\nIntraoperative corticoid administration 77 (48.1%)\n\nPreoperative corticoid use  6 (4%)\n\n* Age and weight expressed as median, 1st and 3rd quartiles; \u2020 Other variables \nexpressed as absolute and relative frequencies.\n\nTable 2 \u2013 Surgical times, urinary volumes, and fluid balance\n\nVariable Values\n\nAnesthesia duration of (min) 240 (180 / 303)\n\nSurgery duration (min) 140 (80 / 206)\n\nExtracorporeal circulation duration (min) \u2020 70 (45 / 107) \n\nAortic clamping duration (min) \u2020 55 (30 / 80) \n\nIntraoperative diuresis (mL/kg) 3.67 (2.0 / 5.5) \n\nFinal fluid balance (mL) + 140 (-25 / +300) \n\nFinal blood balance (mL) +20 (-140 / +120) \n\n* Values expressed as median, 1st and 3rd quartiles; \u2020 In surgeries with \nextracorporeal circulation.\n\nThe estimated RACHS-1 surgical risk11 has also influenced \nthose values, with lower blood glucose levels in group 1, \nconstituted by lower complexity surgeries (Table 5). Although \nthe RACHS-1 score categorizes pediatric cardiac surgeries \ninto six groups according to short-term mortality (in increasing \norder), the greatest blood glucose means were evidenced in \ngroup 2, with intermediate risk, and not in group 3, with a \nhigher presumed risk. This probably reflects the higher ECC \nuse rate in group 2 surgeries (Table 5), which concentrated the \nlong-term intracavitary procedures, such as total correction \nof tetralogy of Fallot. In the present sample, group 3 was \nconstituted mainly by short-term vascular procedures with \n\n374\n\n\n\nOriginal Article\n\nArq Bras Cardiol 2011;97(5):372-379\n\nAlves et al\nBlood glucose level and complications in pediatric surgery\n\nno ECC and a complication rate, such as pulmonary artery \ncerclage and systemic-pulmonary anastomoses, similar to \nthat of group 2. Because of the presumed impact of ECC \non intraoperative blood glucose levels, the surgical sampling \nwas subdivided according to its use for a better analysis of \nthe groups.\n\nTable 6 shows that, in the surgeries without ECC, the patients \nexperiencing infectious and hematological complications had \nhigher means of intraoperative blood glucose levels than \nthose without such complications. In the surgeries requiring \nECC (Table 7), that association was evidenced for infectious \n\nand cardiovascular complications and combined events \n(occurrence of at least one of the complications mentioned). \nThe death rate did not associate with the mean intraoperative \nblood glucose level in procedures with and without ECC.\n\nDiscussion\nAlthough in adults higher blood glucose levels in the \n\nintraoperative and postoperative period of cardiac surgery \nare associated with higher morbidity and mortality6-10, little \nis known about that relation in the pediatric population. \nA large number of possible confounding factors, such as \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Mean intraoperative blood glucose level (mg/dL), with significance level of the difference (p), regarding prematurity, surgery \ncharacter, type of anesthesia, and use of extracorporeal circulation in the procedure\n\nPerioperative condition Mean intraoperative blood glucose levelMean and standard deviation p\n\nPrematurity Yes \u2013 133 (\u00b1 10) No \u2013 132 (\u00b1 36) 0.656\n\nSurgery character  Emergency \u2013 135 (\u00b1 34) Elective \u2013 131 (\u00b1 36) 0.524\n\nType of anesthesia General \u2013 130 (\u00b1 33) General/subarachnoid \u2013 137 (\u00b1 44) 0.566\n\nExtracorporeal circulation Yes \u2013 143 (\u00b1 37) No \u2013 120 (\u00b1 30) &lt;0.001\n\n*Comparison between groups by use of Mann-Whitney test.\n\nGraph 1  \u2013 Mean perioperative blood glucose levels (mg/dL) with standard deviation, according to the outcome of patients regarding postoperative complications \n(combined events).\n\nBL\nO\n\nO\nD \n\nG\nLU\n\nCO\nSE\n\n L\nEV\n\nEL\n (m\n\ng/\ndL\n\n)\n\nWITHOUT COMPLICATION\n\nWITH COMPLICATION \n\nPERIOPERATIVE PERIOD\n\nPreoperative Initial \nintraoperative \n\nlevel \n\nMean \nintraoperative\n\nlevel \n\nMaximum \nintraoperative \n\nlevel\nAdmission\nto the ICU\n\nMean level \nof the 1st \n\npostoperative \nday*p<0.005*p &lt;0.05\n\n375\n\n\n\nOriginal Article\n\nArq Bras Cardiol 2011;97(5):372-379\n\nAlves et al\nBlood glucose level and complications in pediatric surgery\n\nprematurity of the physiological systems, greater availability of \nsurgical procedures, and less uniformity in preoperative clinical \nconditions, makes conclusive results difficult to obtain. \n\nFigure 1 shows the perioperative variation of blood glucose \nlevels in patients without intercurrences and those with at least \none of the complications analyzed in the postoperative period. \nThe mean and the maximum value found during surgery \nshowed a positive statistical association with the occurrence of \ncomplications, which was evidenced neither in the measurements \non ICU admission nor in the mean of the first postoperative \nday. This is the opposite of the result reported by Polito et al12, \nwho found no association between severe complications and \nintraoperative blood glucose levels, but showed greater blood \nglucose levels in the first 72 postoperative hours among those \nwith complications. Other studies13-15 have also shown higher \npostoperative blood glucose levels in children with morbidities \nafter cardiac surgery. However, Rossano et al16, studying neonates \nrecovering from the surgery to correct transposition of the great \nvessels, have reported that those who maintained, on the first \npostoperative day, blood glucose levels between 80 and 110 mg/\ndL for a long period (more than 50% of the time), had a higher \nrisk of adverse events than those who maintained blood glucose \nlevels over 200mg/dL. \n\nAs previously mentioned, several confounding variables \nshould be considered when assessing the results, and the sample \nshould be subdivided for better analysis. Figure 1 shows the data \n\nof the general population studied, and the differences found in \nthe mean and maximum blood glucose levels in the intraoperative \nperiod can be explained by the use of high doses of corticoid and \nof ECC. Both factors are associated with inherent complications \nand usually indicate clinical and surgical situations of higher \nrisk, requiring a specific analysis of the subgroups. Regarding \nthe mean blood glucose level of the first postoperative day, \nwhich did not differ in patients with or without intercurrences, \nother non-controlled variables, such as insulin use or glucose \nadministration rate at the ICU at the discretion of the physician \nin charge, can have influenced the blood glucose levels of the \ntwo groups, hindering their interpretation and comparison with \ndata in the literature.\n\nWhen analyzing the clinical and surgical factors that can \ntheoretically influence intraoperative blood glucose levels, the \nfollowing were not associated with differences in the mean blood \nglucose level in the period: prematurity; age group; elective or \nemergency character of the procedure; and type of anesthesia \nused (general alone or general with spinal anesthesia). The \nuse of ECC, however, was associated with significantly higher \nintraoperative blood glucose levels (Table 4). Although the \ncorticosteroid dose of the protocol can explain that association, \nECC per se is one of the major triggers of pro-inflammatory \nactivity in surgery, with substantial elevations in cytokines and \ncirculating interleukines17, thus, higher blood glucose levels are \nexpected with ECC use. Thus, patients were subdivided according \nto ECC use in the surgical procedure for analyzing the relation \nbetween the mean intraoperative blood glucose level and the \noccurrence of specific complications of the major body systems \nin each situation (Tables 6 and 7). \n\nBased on the analysis of postoperative complication rates \naccording to ECC use, this study showed that infectious \ncomplications were associated with higher intraoperative blood \nglucose levels, regardless of ECC use. In procedures without ECC, \nhematological complications were associated with higher blood \nglucose means during surgery, while in procedures with ECC, that \nassociation occurred with cardiovascular complications.  \n\nWhen comparing with studies in the adult population, \nsome differences in the subtypes of complications can be \nobserved. Ouattara et al9, in a prospective analysis, have \nreported that a poor intraoperative blood glucose control, four \nconsecutive measures over 200 mg/dL, was associated with \ngreater rates of death and cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Mean intraoperative blood glucose level according to \nage group\n\nAge group\nMean intraoperative blood glucose level \n\n(mg/dl)\nMean and standard deviation\n\n&lt;30 days 138 (\u00b1 34)\n\n1 to 12 months 127 (\u00b1 34)\n\n1 to 3 years 137 (\u00b1 48)\n\n3 to 8 years 128 (\u00b1 33)\n\n> 8 years 134 (\u00b1 28)\n\n* Significance level of the differences in blood glucose level according to \nage group by use of the Kruskal-Wallis test; p = 0.723\n\nTable 5 \u2013 Mean intraoperative blood glucose levels with standard deviation (mg/dL), rates of extracorporeal circulation use, and relative \nfrequency of complications (combined events) according to adjusted surgical risk (RACHS-1)\n\nSURGICAL RISK \nABSOLUTE \n\nAND RELATIVE \nFREQUENCY\n\nMEAN INTRAOPERATIVE BLOOD\nGLUCOSE LEVEL\n\nMEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION\n\nEXTRACORPOREAL \nCIRCULATION USE \n\nRELATIVE FREQUENCY OF \nCOMPLICATIONS\n\nRACHS \u2013 1       1 51 (32%) 116 \u00b1 28 * 28.0 % \u2020 56.0 % \u2021\n\nRACHS \u2013 1       2 51 (32%) 152 \u00b1 42 * 79.6 % \u2020 87.8 % \u2021\n\nRACHS \u2013 1       3 58 (36%) 128 \u00b1 29 * 39.7 % \u2020 84.5 % \u2021\n\n* Significance level of the differences in blood glucose levels according to surgical risk \u2013 p<0.001 (Kruskal-Wallis); \u2020 Significantly higher rate of ECC use in RACHS-1 \n2 procedures - p<0.001 (chi-square in combinations of the groups); \u2021 Significantly lower rate of complications in RACHS-1 1 group \u2013 p = 0.001 (chi-square in \ncombinations of the groups).\n\n376\n\n\n\nOriginal Article\n\nArq Bras Cardiol 2011;97(5):372-379\n\nAlves et al\nBlood glucose level and complications in pediatric surgery\n\nneurological, but not infectious, complications in diabetic adults \nundergoing myocardial revascularization with ECC.

Duncan et al18, \nhowever, have reported a positive association between a blood \nglucose level over 200 mg/dL during different cardiac surgeries \nwith ECC in adults and the occurrence of infection and prolonged \nmechanical ventilation, even after multivariable analysis with \ncontrol of probable confounding factors. In children, the studies \nusually approach the complications jointly, like combined events, \nfocusing on the postoperative period of complex procedures with \n\nECC. In some of the few studies on that population, Ghafoori \net al19 have reported a greater risk of mediastinitis in individuals \nwhose blood glucose peaks exceeded 130 mg/dL in the first \n24 postoperative hours, while Sz\u00e9kely et al14 have reported a \nhigher rate of heart failure and severe infections in children with \nhyperglycemia after cardiac surgery.\n\nDiabetic patients represent a group at higher risk for \npostoperative infection in several surgical procedures. Even \nthough the noxious effects of chronic hyperglycemia in the \nimmune and vascular systems are known to increase the \nlikelihood of infectious complications, acute hyperglycemia \nalso has its own adverse effects.

The increase in the concentration of \ncirculating inflammatory cytokines has also been reported in \nacute hyperglycemia21, causing a pro-inflammatory state with \nreduced immune function, justifying higher infection rates in \nsuch situations.  \n\nThe reduction in the production and release of endothelial \nnitric oxide, the increase in angiotensin II levels, and the changes \nin vascular reactivity, also associated with hyperglycemia4, can \ncause disorders in the systemic and pulmonary circulations \nwith consequent cardiovascular complications. Even \narrhythmias and myocardial dysfunctions after cardiac surgery \nwith ECC can be attributed to inflammatory changes in the \nheart parenchyma22, presumably proportional to the intensity \nof the inflammatory state.\n\nPlatelet dysfunctions due to a decrease in the nitric-\noxide-induced antiaggregating activity have been reported \nin hyperglycemic patients with acute coronary syndromes23. \nHypercoagulability associated with an elevation in blood \nglucose levels has been demonstrated in situations of \nendotoxemia induced in humans24 and in patients with \nseptic shock25. Such alterations in coagulation can explain \nthe association observed between higher intraoperative blood \nglucose levels and coagulopathy in the postoperative period \nof surgeries without ECC, since both events are related to \nthe magnitude of tissue trauma and the size of the wound \narea. In surgeries with ECC, the higher intensity of the \nanticoagulation used and the negative impact of ECC itself \non the physiological systems of hemostasis constitute the \nmajor causes of postoperative coagulopathy1, which probably \nsurpasses any effect of blood glucose levels in such situations.\n\nThe present study has the limitations expected from a \nretrospective study. Although positive associations between \nhyperglycemia and postoperative complications have been \nobserved, causality cannot be established. The lack of institutional \nprotocols to measure and control blood glucose levels hindered a \n\nlonger postoperative follow-up and a more detailed assessment \nof possible intraoperative influencing factors (relationship of the \nmarkers with ECC variables, impact of specific anesthetic or \nsurgical measures). The impact of other confounding variables, \nwhich were not assessed, cannot be eliminated in data analysis, \nsince other elements can justify the associations found.\n\nSeveral advances in medical knowledge and improvement \nin perioperative care have contributed in a favorable way to \nreduce morbidity and mortality in pediatric cardiac surgery. \nThe intraoperative and immediate postoperative periods are \nimportant for the adoption of measures and managements that \ncan favorably influence the clinical outcome of patients. Thus, \nlaboratory markers of prognosis should be actively pursued to \nhelp the surgical/anesthetic team to improve their therapeutic \ndecisions. As demonstrated in our study, higher blood glucose \nlevels during cardiac surgeries in children did not correlate \nwith mortality, but were associated with a higher occurrence \nof infectious, cardiovascular, and hematological complications \ndepending on ECC use in the procedure. However, the impact \nof specific measures for controlling blood glucose levels, such \nas insulin administration in hyperglycemia, has not been \nconsistently established in the literature, and further studies are \nrequired for its determination.\n\nPotential Conflict of Interest\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was \n\nreported.\n\nSources of Funding\nThere were no external funding sources for this study.\n\nStudy Association\nThis article is part of the thesis of master submitted by \n\nRodrigo Leal Alves, from Faculdade de Medicina de Botucatu \u2013 \nUniversidade Estadual Paulista.\n\nReferences\n1.
