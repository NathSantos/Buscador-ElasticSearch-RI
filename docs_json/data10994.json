For instance, some authors say that KM has two ages, the first corresponding to IM, \naiming to store, explore and transfer explicit knowledge; the second aiming to explore, improve \ncommunication and innovation, focusing the need to manage tacit knowledge, moving from transmit \nto learn, becoming a social activity and not only a technological one. \nNevertheless there is a growing interest in KM and organizations say they are doing it, and even in \nmany large, and some small, organizations a new corporate executive is emerging \u2013 the chief \nknowledge officer, CKO. Are they different from the chief information officers, CIO? Are organizations \nreally making KM? Is there, in practice, any difference between KM and IM?  \nTo provide some answers to these questions, this paper presents empirical evidence of how IM/KM is \npracticed in some Portuguese organizations. Based on an exploratory study conducted in four \nPortuguese organizations, the paper describes the practices that are being developed in those \norganizations, discussing them in order to answer the questions:  How do organizations interpret the \nconcepts of IM/KM, do they think they are different? Which IM/KM processes they develop? Which \ncomputer based systems are used to support those processes? Who leads IM/KM and which skills \nare necessary to those executives?  \n \nKeywords: Information Management, Knowledge Management \n \n \n1. Introduction \n \nThe most fundamental assumption about the concept of knowledge management is that knowledge is \na resource amenable to control and management (Hislop, 2009). With this assumption in mind, one \ncan ask whether there is any difference between knowledge management, KM, and information \nmanagement, IM, as information can also be seen as a resource amenable to control and \nmanagement. One can even ask to what extent knowledge can be managed. Does it make sense to \nspeak about KM and IM in an organizational context? \n \nSome authors have tried to clarify the difference between Information Management, IM, and \nKnowledge management, KM, the distinction between these concepts is far from being well \nunderstood in the business community (Bouthillier &amp; Shearer, 2002; Suliman, 2002). Focusing on ICT, \nKing (2007) states that a significant difference between many knowledge management systems, \nKMS, and information management systems, IMS, is that KMS may be less automated, in that they \nmay require human activity in their operation. \n \nAre these concepts, as used today in business language, being properly used? When organizations \ntalk about KM, do they distinguish IM from KM? In what way?  \n \nEven in the literature one can notice a lack of consensus on these issues. There are authors who only \nspeak about KM, associating IM with a first era of KM. The purpose of creating new knowledge, and \nnot only providing access to information useful in decision making, is something commonly identified \nin the literature to distinguish KM and IM. Considering that there is some overlap between these \nconcepts it is understandable that, in practice, it is difficult to identify goals and projects for each one \nof them. \n \nThe main objective of this work is to identify the gap between what the literature says about these \nconcepts and what organizations are doing, focusing on the Portuguese context, in order to \n\nmailto:flopes@upt.pt\nmailto:pmorais@upt.pt\n\n\nunderstand Portuguese organizations\u2019 current KM/IM capabilities and initiatives. In particular this work \naims to answer the following questions: \n \nCan Portuguese organizations distinguish IM from KM? What does distinguish IM from KM for \nPortuguese companies? Are Portuguese organizations carrying out KM or IM projects? Do they know \nhow to categorize their projects? What kind of computer-based systems are they using to support IM \nand KM? \n \nTo provide some answers to these questions, this paper presents empirical evidence of how IM/KM is \npracticed in four Portuguese organizations. \n \nThis paper is organized as follows: the next section, drawing on a literature review, discusses the \nconcepts of IM and KM. The third section briefly describes the methodology, and the fourth presents \nand discusses the results. Finally, some conclusions are drawn. \n \n2. Information Management versus knowledge management \n \nInformation and knowledge are concepts that are widely used in today's society, and more \nsignificantly in the organization and management literature, and even within the business community. \n \nThe evolution of information technologies, the substantial increase in computer systems use and the \namount of information stored in databases, or even videos, texts and emails, together with the need \nfor innovation and competitiveness, are the factors that have launched these two concepts for the \nscope of organizations. \n \nWhile the concept of information in an organizational context is by no means new, the same is not \ntrue about knowledge. It was, previously, only associated with people. \n \nMuch has been written about information and knowledge (Davenport, Long, &amp; Beers, 1998; Prusak, \n1997; Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995) and many definitions can be found. Although there is still a lack of \nconsensus, it is already accepted that these concepts are strongly related. \n \nWe can say that information is a conceptual representation of reality that enables communication \nbetween people. In turn, knowledge includes information, experiences and thought, processes of the \nindividual himself, being created and acquired through a learning process, allowing men to take \naction.  \n \nPolanyi (1983) distinguished tacit knowledge from explicit knowledge; it can be said that explicit \nknowledge is what we commonly call information (Chilton &amp; Bloodgood, 2008; Grant, 2007). Using \nthese concepts Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi (1995) speak about the SECI model of knowledge creation: \nsocialisation, externalisation, combination and internalisation. \n \nBearing all these, closely related, concepts in mind, we can deduce that Information Management and \nKnowledge Management should also be strongly interrelated; we may even question whether it \nmakes sense to talk about IM and KM (Bouthillier &amp; Shearer, 2002; Suliman, 2002). \n \nIM is usually understood as a practice that aims to increase organizational effectiveness by providing \ntimely information of value, ie quality, quantity and therefore usefulness. To obtain timely information it \nis necessary, on the one hand, that the information is organized and available whenever it is required \nto be used. In addition, to have value, information should not be redundant or inconsistent. Therefore, \nIM should also be concerned with ensuring that the information provided is not redundant or \ninconsistent.  \n  \nNowadays, the success of IM is closely related to the proper use of information technologies and, for \nthis reason, the profiles of IM experts (CIO \u2013 Chief Information officers) are strongly associated with \ntechnological skills (the traditional IT worker having database and networks knowledge). \n \nKnowledge is intrinsically linked to the learning process. Learning is the articulation of new \ninformation, obtained with the mental process specific to each individual. Thus, KM should care about \n\n\n\ncreating environments where knowledge creation is a reality. Learning, with knowledge creation, is \nrecognized in the literature as being crucial for innovation. \n \nIn the literature, KM is often related to management and organizational performance objectives, and \ndoes not have a technological component as strong as IM; KM has a human and social component, \nwhich is not present in IM. \n \n\nAlthough KM does not necessarily have a technological component, there are many automated tools, \nKMS, that support KM processes in organizations (Pinto, Morais, &amp; Lopes, 2005). A significant \ndifference between KMS and IMS is that while IMS typically require that humans make choices in the \ndevelopment phase and then operate automatically, KMS involve human participation in the operation \nphase (King, 2007). \n \n\nFollowing the authors who argue that KM can be equated with the implementation and use of \nparticular IMS and those who focus on methods of managing knowledge, via people who possess and \nutilize knowledge, we believe that IM can be viewed as a subset of KM. The main differences \nbetween IM and KM are presented in table 1. \n \n\nTable 1: Differences between IM and KM \n IM KM \n\nAim Provide information for decision \nmaking \n\nNew knowledge Creation  \n\nType of knowledge Explicit Tacit \n\nKey processes Create and store Share and acquire \n\nModel of knowledge \ncreation \n\nExternalisation and Combination Internalisation and  \nSocialisation \n\nFocus Information Technology People \n\nTypes of support systems IMS KMS \n\n \n \n3. Methodology \n \nThis study aims to present empirical evidence of how IM/KM is practiced in some Portuguese \norganizations. It takes a qualitative approach to the collection and analysis of the data. \n \nThe study was conducted in four organizations. The organizations were chosen from among large \norganizations in the north of Portugal, the area where the researchers live. An introductory letter \nexplaining the aim of the study and inviting the organizations to participate in this study was sent, in \nApril 2009, to eight organizations. Four of them agreed to participate and in June 2009 the interviews \nwere carried out. The researchers prepared an interview guide which included the main points to be \naddressed, given the questions raised. The questions were generated based on a previous work \ndeveloped by the researchers in the aim of a Ph.D. project  (Pinto, Lopes, &amp; Morais, 2006). In this \nproject a study was conducted in Portugal based on a survey sent to one hundred of the main \nPortuguese organizations in May 2005, with the aim of to know the current practices of the \nPortuguese organizations relating KMS usage and IC measurement  (Pinto, Morais, &amp; Lopes, 2005). \n \nThe persons being interviewed were general managers or managers of information systems \ndepartments. The choice of the kind of people to interview was based on the skills of CIO/CKO \nindentified in the literature. \n\n    \n4. Results and discussion  \n \nIn this section the data collected in the four organizations, Organization1, Organization2, \nOrganization3 and Organization4, is presented and discussed. \n \nOrganization1 is one of the main public transport companies in the Greater Porto area.  \nOrganization2 is the largest European contract manufacturer of personal care, cosmetics, over-the-\ncounter pharmaceuticals and household products, and a leading supplier of tinplate \nand plastic packaging solutions.  \n\n\n\nOrganization3 is a retail company with two major partnerships in the shopping centre and \ntelecommunications sectors. It is the food retail market leader in Portugal. \nOrganization4 works in the telecommunications, media and software and systems integration areas, \nplaying an active role; it is one of the main telecommunications companies operating in Portugal. \nThe data collected in the interviews is presented in tables 2 and 3.  \n \nThe first row of table 2 addresses the question of the distinction between Information Management \nand Knowledge management. We wanted to understand how organizations interpret the concepts of \nIM/KM. \nThe second row focuses on what organizations say about really doing IM and KM, and the third row \non why they are doing it. Whether there is a new corporate executive and how it differs from the chief \ninformation officers is summarised in row four. \nThe last row in table 2 describes the kind of projects developed, classifying them as IM or KM \nprojects. \n \n\nTable 2: IM/KM in Portuguese organizations \n Organization1 Organization2 Organization3 Organization4 \n\nDistinguish \nIM from \n\nKM \n\nYes \nThere was a clear \nfocus on different \ntargets \n\nYes \nConsider broader \nKM \n\nYes \n \n\nNo \nDo not have a sense \nof the distinction \nbetween IM and KM \n\nDo IM/KM Yes Yes \nNot clearly \n\nYes \nWith greater \nemphasis on IM \nthough \nincreasingly \nrecognizing that \nboth are \nimportant \n\nDo IM but there is \nnothing systematized \nabout KM \n\nWhy \nIM/KM \n\nRestructuring of the \ncompany, preparing it \nfor a new position \n\nAlign business \nprocesses across \ndivisions and \ncreating tools for \nusers to raise the \nlevel of \nknowledge \n\nMeet the needs of \nthe organization's \nprocesses, but \neach department \nis responsible for \nits own \nmanagement \n\nThere is a principle, \nunderlying the entire \norganization, that the \ncreation and sharing \nof knowledge is a \nnecessary \nprerequisite for the \ndevelopers to raise \nthe level of \nknowledge \n\nCIO/CKO No \nKM by Process \nManager \nIM by Director of \nOrganization and \nInformation System \nDepartment \n\nNo No No \nThere are only \nSystems analysts, \nProject Managers \nand Programmers  \n\nIM/KM \nProjects \n\nYes \nInitially these two \ntypes of projects were \nindistinguishable. They \nbegan as IM and more \nrecently evolved to \nKM, seeing IM as a \ntool to support KM \nToday it is recognized \nthat KM projects \nmainly focus on \ncollaboration and \nsharing by allowing \nknowledge creation \n\nYes \nInitially IM and \nrecently KM \n\nYes Only IM. There are \nno systematic KM \nprojects \n\n\n\n \nThe table above shows that all organizations, with the exception of organization 4, do IM and KM. Yet \nall acknowledge the existence of IM practices before KM, recognizing that there are differences, \nalthough the two are strongly related. \nThe alignment with the goals, processes and competitiveness of the organization appear as the main \nreasons for doing IM/KM. None of these organisations have a CIO/CKO. Skills associated with the \narea of management and IT are mentioned as being relevant to IM/KM managers. This can lead us to \nconsider that both areas of knowledge are important to these professionals. \nAll organizations acknowledge having IM projects and three also mention the development of KM \nprojects, although one of those three says nothing about these types of projects. It is funny to see that \nOrganization1, as we mention in Section 2, recognizes IM as a subset of KM. This organization cites \ncollaboration systems as an example of KM projects. \n\n \nKM and IM are often supported by computer-based systems, namely by knowledge management \nsystems, KMS, and information management systems, IMS. Table 3 presents a list of the systems in \nuse in these four organizations. They are classified as KMS and IMS according to the answers \nprovided by the managers. \n\n \n\nTable 3: Use of IMS/KMS in Portuguese organizations \n Organization1 Organization2 Organization3 Organization4 \n\nC\no\nm\n\np\nu\nte\n\nr \nb\n\na\ns\ne\nd\n S\n\ny\ns\nte\n\nm\ns\n \n\nKMS \n\nPurchasing platform \n \nSystem for sharing project \nwith designers and contracts \nproject evaluation  \n \nSystem for performance \nanalysis and contractual \nindicators  \n \nSocial Networks \n \nWeb-site ERPs \n\n \nWorkflow \n \ne-learning \n\nIntranet \n \nCooperative portals  \n \ne-learning \n \nWorkflow \n \nBusiness \nIntelligence \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nKnowledge maps \n \nCooperative \nportals \n \nInnovation support \nsystem  \n \nBusiness \nIntelligence  \n \nDocument \nmanagement \nsystem \n \nWorkflow \n \nCompetency \nmanagement \nsystem \n  \n\n \n\nIMS \n\nDocument management \nsystem \n \nApplications of remote \nmonitoring and dynamic \ninventory \n\nERP \n \nData warehouse \n \nEAI \n \nTransportation \nManagement \nSystem \n \nDocument \nmanagement \nsystem \n \nSuite Microsoft \nOffice \n\n \nAll of the types of KMS most referred to in the literature are used by these four organizations, which \nreveal, at least, knowledge of their existence/use, although their classification as KMS or IMS may not \nbe the most accurate. \n \nInternet Supported Systems where collaboration and hence learning is possible are mentioned by all \ncompanies. Performance analysis systems are used in almost all of the organizations. These \nexamples indirectly show they are being used within the scope of KM and IM, respectively, as the \nformer are aimed at the sharing and creation of knowledge and the latter at the availability and access \nto the right information for decision making. \n\n\n\nIn this study we note that there is already some awareness of the differences between IM and KM in \nthe companies studied. Organization1 is the most aware and knowledgeable about the differences, \nand it is also the best in using this new terminology. Organization3 also distinguishes IM from KM, \nhowever we note some lack of precision in the answers. They state that, in practice, they do not \ndistinguish them.  Both recognise the focus of KM on knowledge creation and sharing.  \n \nRegarding the process of knowledge sharing, Organization3 associates it only with e-mail exchange; \nhowever Organization1 is concerned with the development, through social networking, of \nenvironments to share knowledge, reinforcing the need for sharing opinions and experiences. \n \nOrganization4 performs the worst in terms of distinguishing IM and KM. Organization2, despite saying \nIM and KM are different, shows a focus on information management and a lack of precision in \nidentifying the differences between the two concepts. In spite of listing examples of KMS used in the \ncompany, we note that these are only used in information management. The excess of data and lack \nof valuable information for business is a problem for this organization. We can say that in practice this \ncompany does not distinguish IM from KM very well, or IMS from KMS. \n \nWe can say that Organization1 correctly distinguishes KMS from IMS. In Organization3 we notice \nsome lack of precision. During the interview some confusion was noted, for example, the \nimplementation of an ERP system was described as a KM project. Organization4 clearly does not \ndistinguish IMS from KMS.  \n \nThe difficulties in implementing IM or KM projects listed by companies 1 and 3 were: \n\n? Transforming information into knowledge  \n\n? Promoting sharing processes \n\n? Using the most adequate technology \n\n? Promoting the necessary changes in the organization, in the organizational culture and in the \nmanagement \n\n? Involving top management \n\n? Lack of time to share knowledge \n \nThese are the difficulties commonly cited in the bibliography as the main problems when developing \nKM projects.  \n \nWe can conclude that these organizations have few difficulties when developing IM projects, but that \nthey still need to improve and change some practices to develop successful KM projects. \n \nIt is not surprising that organizations 2 and 4 do not share those difficulties, since they show lower \nlevels of maturity for the implementation of IM and KM.  \n \nOrganization1 recognises that activities related to KM are holist activities and that it is necessary to \nalign KM projects with the organizational strategy. The manager even stated: \u201cInformation \nmanagement and knowledge management need to have a very close and connected existence, an \norganizational and strategic coherence\u201c. \n \nAlthough KM is practiced in some organizations, it is only related to knowledge creation and sharing \nand never to innovation and organisational competitiveness as referred in the literature. \n \n5. Conclusion \n\n \nSupporting knowledge creation and sharing across organizations is not a new concept. However, it is \nimportant to be aware that this is not the same as information creation and sharing, especially if we \nare referring to the support information technology can give to those processes. If IM and KM are so \ndifferent, why are the terms often misused?  \n \nIM is a reality in the organizations studied; it is well rooted and there are lots of projects being \ndeveloped. We can say that they have reached a satisfactory level of maturity. The same is not true \nfor KM; although the organizations selected are some of the largest in Portugal, only one has a higher \nlevel of maturity, considering that KM needs to be strongly related to organizational strategy. \n\n\n\nWe believe that KM is going to be, in short term, a concern for Portuguese organizations, \nrepresenting a shift from a focus on information to a focus on the individuals that create and share \nknowledge.  \n \nThis study has shown that organizations distinguish IM from KM, but that there may still be some lack \nof precision and knowledge regarding these two practices. Not all organizations see the need to carry \nout these two practices, and IM appears to have a higher level of maturity. They all recognize the role \nof IT in supporting IM or KM projects, however there is a lack of precision in their classification \n(IMS/KMS). \n \nWe found that there is still no CIO/CKO with specific skills to manage those practices. This role is \nassociated with management and IT skills. In future work it will be important to study the skills \nnecessary to carry out these practices. Are these practices not achieving the appropriate level of \neffectiveness because they are not led by professionals with the necessary skills? \n\n \n6.
