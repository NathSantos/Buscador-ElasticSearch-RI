In particular,\n\nthe advent of renewable energy and the massive penetration of variable renewable electric-\n\nity have shaken some of the traditional pillars of the electricity sector. Despite being the\n\nsymbol of a liberalised market, the pool market is a trading mechanism which induces great\n\nuncertainty on market participants\u2019 operations, becoming a considerable source of risk to the\n\ngoals defined by the electricity sector\u2019s companies, particularly the goal of profit maximisation.\n\nIn this context, the first objective of this work is the extension of the multi-agent electricity\n\nmarket simulator (MAN-REM), developed by the Portuguese National Laboratory of Energy\n\nand Geology, allowing greater and better operation and mainly more interactivity of this soft-\n\nware regarding the profit maximisation of generation companies through the optimisation of\n\ntheir portfolio\u2019s production scheduling.\n\nAfter the development of a mouse and keyboard based interface which greatly facilitates\n\nthe interaction with users and provides a functioning structure, three profit optimisation mod-\n\nels were programmed and added to the software. Each of these models is characterised by its\n\nown portfolio composition, including the following technology portfolios: thermal, hydro and\n\nwind, and thermal and wind.\n\nAfter the extension of the simulator with these new features, this work focused on demon-\n\nstration of the optimisation models, aiming to investigate their response to di?erent input\n\nvalues, namely to market prices forecasts (necessary to the self-scheduling algorithms). Addi-\n\ntionally, a second case study was considered to use some of the initial features of MAN-REM\n\nto demonstrate the sensibility of market-clearing to higher wind production ratios.\n\nThe results of the first case study revealed a good logical coordination between the equa-\n\ntions of each optimisation model and the output values. Furthermore, the second case study\n\ndemonstrated the well-known impact of high levels of variable generation on market clearing\n\nprices.\n\nKeywords: Self-scheduling Optimisation | Portfolio Management | Pool Market | Bilateral\nContracts | Multi-agent Systems.\n\nvii\n\n\n\nviii\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nA evoluc?a?o do sector ele?ctrico, tanto ao n??vel do seu modelo de nego?cio atrave?s da liberalizac?a?o\n\nde um mercado ha? muito controlado e/ou regulado pelos estados, quer ao n??vel da evoluc?a?o das\n\ntecnologias de produc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica, apresenta grandes desafios. O advento das ener-\n\ngias renova?veis e a penetrac?a?o massiva da produc?a?o de eletricidade de cariz varia?vel vieram\n\nabalar alguns do princ??pios pelos quais o sector sempre se regeu.\n\nApesar de se assumir como o mecanismo s??mbolo de um regime de mercado liberalizado,\n\no mercado em bolsa (pool) induz grande incerteza nas operac?o?es dos agentes que nele partic-\n\nipam, tornando-se uma fonte de risco para os objectivos trac?ados por cada agente, podendo\n\nrepresentar, em u?ltima ana?lise, perdas na?o negligencia?veis que se refletem nos balanc?os das\n\nempresas e, por conseguinte, na sua sustentabilidade financeira a me?dio e longo prazo. A\n\nopc?a?o por contratos bilaterais de compra e venda de energia ele?ctrica, cujas condic?o?es de\n\ntransac?a?o sa?o detalhadamente definidas apo?s negociac?a?o e acordo entre as partes, torna-se,\n\ndeste modo, uma opc?a?o de mitigac?a?o do risco em que os agentes de mercado incorrem.\n\nNesta perspectiva, o objectivo deste trabalho e? composto, numa primeira fase, pela exten-\n\nsa?o do simulador multi-agente de mercados de energia, MAN-REM, desenvolvido pelo Lab-\n\norato?rio Nacional de Energia e Geologia (LNEG), permitindo uma maior operacionalidade e\n\ninteratividade do software na sua vertente de maximizac?a?o do lucro das empresas (agentes)\n\nde produc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica, atrave?s da optimizac?a?o do agendamento de operac?o?es da sua\n\ncarteira de ativos, no que respeita a?s infraestruturas de produc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica.\n\nO plano de agendamento e? calculado com base nas caracter??sticas te?cnicas de cada central,\n\ncomo o custo de produc?a?o fixo, custo de produc?a?o varia?vel, custo de desligamento, custo de\n\nligac?a?o e, no caso de centrais te?rmicas, custos de emissa?o de gases de efeito de estufa. A soma\n\nde todos estes factores (quando aplica?veis) representa, nos modelos de optimizac?a?o considera-\n\ndos, o encargo financeiro decorrente da produc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica que devera? ser minorado\n\npela colocac?a?o informada de volumes de energia no mercado, permitindo a anulac?a?o dos custos\n\natrave?s da majorac?a?o dos proveitos. Consequentemente, as previso?es de disponibilidade de\n\nproduc?a?o de centrais ele?ctricas de cariz varia?vel \u2014 traduzidas atrave?s de dados hora?rios de\n\nvelocidade do vento (para a gerac?a?o eo?lica) e escorre?ncia de a?guas (para a produc?a?o h??drica)\n\n\u2014 e a estimativa de prec?os de mercado para compra e venda de energia ele?ctrica, sa?o tam-\n\nbe?m dados de entrada essenciais, que permitem a um produtor \u201cprever\u201d quais as unidades de\n\nproduc?a?o renta?veis a uma determinada hora e qual a forma mais bene?fica para a sua venda:\n\no mercado em bolsa ou a contratac?a?o bilateral.\n\nix\n\n\n\nA construc?a?o de um conjunto de janelas, em linguagem JAVA, que permitam definir uma\n\ninterface de apoio ao manuseamento das novas funcionalidades de agendamento, foi uma fase\n\nessencial do trabalho. As diversas janelas criadas permitem simular as func?o?es de adic?a?o\n\nmanual de novos agentes produtores \u2014 incluindo todas as caracter??sticas te?cnicas dos seus\n\nportfo?lios segundo as va?rias tecnologias de produc?a?o inerentes a cada central \u2014, a adic?a?o de\n\nnovos agentes a partir de ficheiros de dados externos (EXCEL), a optimizac?a?o do agendamento\n\nda produc?a?o de um agente, a visualizac?a?o de dados de sa??da detalhados do processo de opti-\n\nmizac?a?o e, finalmente, a simulac?a?o de uma plataforma electro?nica de casamento automa?tico\n\nde ofertas compra e venda de energia em ambiente de transac?a?o bilateral. Adicionalmente,\n\nforam programados tre?s modelos de optimizac?a?o de lucro atrave?s do agendamento da pro-\n\nduc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica, resultando num exerc??cio de programac?a?o moderado a elevado. Os\n\nmodelos contam com diferentes composic?o?es caracter??sticas de portfo?lios, tendo sido consid-\n\neradas carteiras de unidades produtivas exclusivamente te?rmicas, h??dricas e eo?licas e ainda\n\nte?rmicas e eo?licas. Os tre?s modelos foram adicionados ao simulador ja? existente (MAN-REM).\n\nApo?s a ampliac?a?o das func?o?es do simulador, quer ao n??vel da interface, quer do co?digo\n\nnecessa?rio para possibilitar todas as suas funcionalidades e a compatibilidade com o software\n\nja? existente, este trabalho focou-se essencialmente na demonstrac?a?o dos modelos de optimiza-\n\nc?a?o da produc?a?o adicionados ao simulador, de forma a analisar a sua resposta a diferentes\n\nvalores de entrada, nomeadamente a?s previso?es de prec?os de mercado em bolsa (necessa?rias\n\naos algoritmos de agendamento) e, assim, assegurar o seu correto funcionamento.\n\nA formulac?a?o do primeiro caso de estudo, composto por duas simulac?o?es do mercado dia?rio\n\npor cada exerc??cio de validac?a?o dos modelos testados, requereu, para as vinte e quatro horas\n\nde um dado dia, a utilizac?a?o de um conjunto de perfis de consumo fixos, alocados a um grupo\n\nde agentes comercializadores de energia ele?ctrica \u2014 retalhistas \u2014 assim como um outro con-\n\njunto de ofertas de venda de energia, proveniente de um grupo de produtores de eletricidade,\n\nde forma a dotar o mercado de uma competic?a?o significativa, tanto do lado da procura como\n\nda oferta. Para cada um dos modelos, a primeira simulac?a?o de mercado contou com a partici-\n\npac?a?o de todos os agentes referidos \u2014 produtores e retalhistas \u2014 e de uma oferta de venda de\n\nenergia adicional proposta por um novo agente produtor (produtor-teste). Os vinte e quatro\n\nprec?os relativos ao custo marginal de mercado, resultantes da simulac?a?o da primeira sessa?o,\n\nforam enta?o utilizados como previso?es de prec?os do mercado pool do produtor-teste numa\n\nsegunda sessa?o de mercado, na qual as suas ofertas de venda de energia ele?ctrica, decorrentes\n\nda sua atividade produtiva, foram sujeitas ao algoritmo de optimizac?a?o a ser validado. Desta\n\nforma, a concorda?ncia de valores referentes aos volumes de energia ele?ctrica enviados para o\n\nmercado nas primeira e segunda sesso?es pelo produtor-teste, permitiram atestar o funciona-\n\nmento dos algoritmos de optimizac?a?o em estudo. De facto, os resultados dos testes realizados\n\nx\n\n\n\nrevelaram uma boa coordenac?a?o entre as func?o?es-objectivo e as restric?o?es lo?gicas e te?cnicas\n\naos problemas a serem solucionados pelos tre?s modelos em estudo, sendo os dados finais co-\n\nerentes com os resultados que seriam esperados.\n\nDe forma a utilizar as novas ferramentas disponibilizadas pelo MAN-REM para a demon-\n\nstrac?a?o da susceptibilidade dos prec?os de mercado em bolsa a? variabilidade intr??nseca a? pro-\n\nduc?a?o de energia ele?ctrica de origem renova?vel, nomeadamente a partir do recurso eo?lico, e\n\ndos seus reduzidos custos marginais, foi considerado outro caso de estudo. Deste modo, e\n\nutilizando o mesmo grupo de agentes retalhistas do exerc??cio anterior, foram considerados\n\ndois cena?rios antago?nicos no que respeita a?s condic?o?es atmosfe?ricas para produc?a?o renova?vel,\n\ntendo sido analisados os efeitos da maior ou menor contribuic?a?o de energia eo?lica sobre o\n\nprec?o marginal do mercado bolsista. Consequentemente, foi poss??vel verificar o efeito de re-\n\nduc?a?o substancial dos prec?os marginais do mercado bolsista nas situac?o?es em que a produc?a?o\n\neo?lica varia?vel apresenta valores me?dios hora?rios acima da me?dia, corroborando o pressuposto\n\nteo?rico de que tecnologias com menores custos de produc?a?o marginal contribuem para uma\n\nmaior eficie?ncia deste mecanismo de comercializac?a?o, na?o so? atrave?s de uma reduc?a?o do custo\n\nda energia ele?ctrica em mercado por substituic?a?o de tecnologias mais dispendiosas, como tam-\n\nbe?m de um aumento do bem-estar social por efeito da majorac?a?o do volume total de energia\n\nele?ctrica a ser efetivamente negociado e transacionado em mercado.\n\nPalavras-chave: Optimizac?a?o de Agendamento da Produc?a?o |

strategic area for both the economy and the sovereignty\n\nof states, not only by its impact on services, but also by its importance on the daily life of\n\ncompanies, industries and households. Therefore, it is expected that the optimisation and\n\nimprovement of e?ciency in the sector result in a relieving of energy costs \u2014 a powerful\n\ncontributor to the financial burden of almost all activities.\n\nElectricity is mainly produced in large power plants, away from major centres of con-\n\nsumption, typically in suburban and industrial areas, due to technical and economic reasons,\n\nincluding availability of primary energy resources as well as infrastructural and environmental\n\nconstraints. The electrical energy produced in large plants is delivered to the transmission\n\nsystem, consisting of high voltage power lines \u2014 the energy highways. Through transformers,\n\npower flows from high to medium and low voltage distribution networks, and then to con-\n\nsumers, the base of the electricity value chain.\n\nGeneration units vary with respect to size, production cost, technology, fuel, and the time\n\nrequired to respond to orders of dispatch (i.e., the time elapsed from the moment when the\n\ndecision to generate electricity is taken and the moment when it is delivered to the grid).\n\nFrom the point of view of both market and grid operators, units with more flexibility and\n\ndispatch-ability represent higher value. Controlling such units o?ers the opportunity to adapt\n\nproduction to instant consumption, maintaining equilibrium and ensuring the security of sup-\n\nply [1].\n\nRegional geopolitics, geographical barriers and the availability of natural resources are nat-\n\nural shapers of the diversity and characteristics of electrical systems across the world. Given\n\nthat, the recent modernisation of electricity generation fleets (and related infrastructures) into\n\na renewables-based production towards a more sustainable power sector is often constrained\n\nby the same factors as well as by cost and technical suitability of solutions.\n\n1\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nThe global introduction of renewables for mass electricity production, which became all\n\ntoo apparent during the last twenty years, has embodied an attempt of countries to limit their\n\nCO2 emissions \u2014 and meet the targets defined and signed at the last Conference of the Par-\n\nties, embodied in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 as well as their risk\n\nexposure to fuels price oscillations, which have proven significantly unstable due to several\n\nphenomena, such as armed conflicts, cartelisation, price manipulation and economic wars.\n\nOverall, this policy has led to an increased external independence of the primary energy\u2019s\n\nimporting countries, promoting greater safety of supply. However, these deep changes in the\n\nelectrical systems, as they are being made, have also involved the rise of some consequent\n\nissues that might disturb the balance and operational status quo of the electrical sector.\n\nAbreast renewables\u2019 deployment, investment on cleaner fossil-based technologies is a key-\n\nalternative onto a more sustainable electricity system. As fossil fuels represented 65% of the\n\nworld\u2019s electricity mix in 2015, the deployment of cleaner electricity production technolo-\n\ngies assumes a clear and logical pathway towards the decarbonisation of the sector. IEA\u2019s\n\nforecasted scenarios for climate change mitigation, released under the \u201cEnergy Technology\n\nPerspectives 2015\u201d publication, stated that, under a 2-degrees scenario (2DS)1, in 2050, fos-\n\nsil fuels will still play an important role, accounting 20% of the overall produced electricity,\n\nwhereas, considering a 6DS2, fossil fuels would remain stable and continue to lead as the\n\nmain source of electric generation. However, despite the considerable importance that hy-\n\ndrocarbons are expected to play, even in the 2DS, only 7% of the electricity produced by\n\nfossil-fuelled thermal plants is generated by facilities without carbon capture and storage \u2014\n\nmainly gas-fired facilities with low capacity factors, running occasionally when renewables\n\nbalancing is necessary, which would allow an average CO2 intensity of about 40 gCO2/kWh\n\n(533 gCO2/kWh in 2012). In order to achieve such ambitious goals, countries must start to\n\nact and pave the way with strategic plans to contain and reduce greenhouse emission gases.\n\nOn the contrary, if a strong dependency on fossil fuels endures, leading to a 6DS, an average\n\nCO2 intensity of 480 gCO2/kWh will be the most probable scenario, a completely contrasting\n\nforecast when compared with what should be achieved to remain under the 2DS (see Figure\n\n1.1).\n\n1The 2-Degree Scenario (2DS) is the main focus of Energy Technology Perspectives. The 2DS lays out an\nenergy system deployment pathway and an emissions trajectory consistent with at least a 50% chance of limiting\nthe average global temperature increase to 2?C. The 2DS limits the total remaining cumulative energy-related\nCO2 emissions between 2015 and 2100 to 1 000 GtCO2. The 2DS reduces CO2 emissions (including emissions\nfrom fuel combustion and process and feedstock emissions in industry) by almost 60% by 2050 (compared with\n2013), with carbon emissions being projected to decline after 2050 until carbon neutrality is reached [2].\n\n2The 6-Degree Scenario (6DS) is largely an extension of current trends. Primary energy demand and CO2\nemissions would grow by about 60% from 2013 to 2050, with about 1700 GtCO2 of cumulative emissions.\nIn the absence of e?orts to stabilise the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, the average global\ntemperature rise above pre-industrial levels is projected to reach almost 5.5?C in the long term and almost\n4?C by the end of this century [2].\n\n2\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 1.1: Evolution of regional electricity generation mixes under the 2DS [2]\n\nOne of the main aspects of the undergoing global energy transition is the variable nature\n\nof the production of new CO2-free technologies that are currently in great expansion. De-\n\nspite the fact that significant deployment of technologies \u2014 such as wind and photovoltaic\n\n\u2014 has indeed the power to reduce greenhouse gases\u2019 emissions (GHG), the uncertainty that\n\ncharacterises these energy sources, and hence their output, presents important and complex\n\nchallenges to the grid.\n\nThe second aspect concerns the decentralised nature of low- and medium-power produc-\n\ntion facilities \u2014 small hydro, wind or solar photovoltaic \u2014 and their necessity to be often\n\ninstalled in remote areas where optimised production can be achieved. Consequently, both\n\nthe scale and the scattered production raise significant challenges of interconnection to the\n\ngrid, making them more suitable to be connected to distribution networks rather than to\n\nhigh-voltage lines [3].\n\nThe third aspect is related to the fugacity of market conditions: thermal-based electricity\n\ngeneration is very dependent on financial and commodities markets, since fuel prices are the\n\nmain drivers which influence production costs. Therefore, dynamic prices of oil, gas or coal\n\ninduce significant changes on the generation unit\u2019s merit order. The current panorama of\n\nfuel prices, for instance, dictated by political and international relations, reveals an implosion\n\nof coal prices over the past few years (Figure 1.2). This sharp fall is mainly caused by the\n\nshale gas boom occurring intensively in the United States of America, where a significant\n\nshare of the internally produced and once consumed coal has now to be drained out to other\n\nregions, \u201dflooding\u201d the market. The e?ects of excess of coal in the market are being felt in\n\nthe Europe, as coal prices fell and remained significantly low during the last years. At the\n\n3\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 1.2: Evolution of coal prices in several maturities (Jan13 - Oct15) [5]\n\nFigure 1.3: Evolution of capacity factors of gas- and coal-fired power plants in Portugal (2000-2014) [6, 7]\n\nsame time, high regional prices of natural gas and geo-political conflicts whether in Eastern\n\nEurope, Middle East or Northern Africa, have increased doubts and reticence among gas mar-\n\nket\u2019s users, namely in the electricity production sector. Consequently, the pressure exerted by\n\nlow coal prices and the absence of an e?cient and strong carbon european market on other\n\ntechnologies, particularly gas, have yielded perverse e?ects on the path towards the CO2-free\n\nelectricity generation targets and the environmental sustainability of European countries [4].\n\nIn fact, capacity factors of gas-fired power plants have been decreasing over the last few years\n\ndue to the growing installed capacity and decreasing generation shares. On the contrary, the\n\ncoal-fired capacity has seen its capacity factors rising (Figure 1.3). This reality results in\n\nsignificant setbacks in terms of sustainability policies, a?ecting, most of all, the environment\n\nand threatening the achievement of climate change mitigation goals, by increasing electricity\u2019s\n\nCO2 intensity.\n\n4\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nAll the mentioned conditions \u2014 price variation of primary energy sources, intermittent\n\nproduction of most of the newly added (renewable) installed capacity and scattered generation\n\n\u2014 are just some of the contributors which justify the development of computational systems\n\nthat allow specialists to study the dynamic of markets and allow market participants to foresee\n\nand plan their actions in advance. Such tools, often called \u201cmarket simulators\u201d, can be part\n\nof the necessary decision-taking process for the technical governance of utilities. Additionally,\n\nand among others, these software tools provide invaluable support to study the impact that\n\ndi?erent technologies, such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), battery storage banks or\n\npumping storage, may have on the market, being a source of knowledge on the behaviour of\n\nmarginal costs, generation units\u2019 merit order and electricity market-clearing prices.\n\nBy using accurate self-scheduling models, producers are provided with invaluable help to\n\nmanage their unit portfolios in order to achieve their goals \u2014 profit maximisation, costs min-\n\nimisation or others. At the same time, market simulators constitute an important platform\n\nfor researchers who try to adapt market rules, processes, and policies to a non-static reality.\n\nSimulations, generally developed under multi-agent systems (MAS), provide an approxima-\n\ntion to \u201creal\u201d decisions, and can be important to all market participants.\n\n1.2 Objectives\n\nThe main objectives of this thesis are as follows3:\n\n1. Study the existing models for electrical energy generation, namely those who seek a\n\nproper market settlement towards the maximisation of profit;\n\n2. Study the main energy markets, particularly the day-ahead market and the bilateral\n\ncontracts market;\n\n3. Study the multi-agent simulator \u201cMAN-REM\u201d, which permits market participants to\n\nenrol in energy transactions, negotiate bilateral agreements [8, 9], colligate with each\n\nother [10], and manage the active role of consumers [11, 12];\n\n4. Adopt some of the self-scheduling models referred in (1) and expand the existing version\n\nof MAN-REM by developing and implementing computational agents which simulate\n\nelectrical energy producers, and whose operations are particularly based on those models;\n\n5. Expand MAN-REM by adding market simulation functions for very-short over-the-\n\ncounter bilateral contracts clearing;\n\n3This work was performed under the project MAN-REM (FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-020397), supported by\nboth FEDER and National funds through the program \u201cCOMPETE\u2013Programa Operacional Tema?tico Factores\nde Competividade\u201d and \u201cFCT\u2013Fundac?a?o para a Cie?ncia e a Tecnologia\u201d.\n\n5\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n6. Develop a case study to demonstrate the functioning of the self-scheduling models added\n\nto the MAN-REM;\n\n7. Develop a case study regarding the trading of high renewable electricity levels on the\n\nwholesale market and evaluate its impact on the day-ahead market prices;\n\n1.3 Structure\n\nThis dissertation is divided into six chapters: Introduction, Liberalised Electrical Energy Mar-\n\nkets and Multi-Agent Systems, Portfolio Optimisation and Self-Scheduling Models, MAN-REM\n\nExtension, Production Scheduling - Case Studies and Conclusion. In the first chapter, one\n\ncan find a short introduction and contextualisation of this work as well as its main objectives\n\nand the structure of this document.\n\nThe second chapter is entirely dedicated to a concise explanation of a broad range of topics\n\nthat were considered relevant to this work. Platforms for electricity trading, most common\n\nmaturity periods for its transaction, principal market agents and a summary of the Iberian\n\nelectricity market (MIBEL) regarding its composition, operation and challenges due to the\n\ndeployment of variable clean electricity generation technologies are also addressed.\n\nThe third chapter presents a selection of three optimisation models, developed for genera-\n\ntion companies to self-schedule their production. The models will be added to the pre-existing\n\nMAN-REM simulation software, increasing its features.\n\nThe fourth chapter presents an exhaustive description of the developments made to the\n\nMAN-REM simulator, including all the JAVA-programmed windows, which constitute the\n\nnew interface, built to allow an user-friendly use of the software and its inherent markets.\n\nThe fifth chapter presents two case studies. The first is meant to demonstrate and analyse\n\nthe new features of the MAN-REM simulator by testing its response to several input data, and\n\nthe second to demonstrate (through a market simulation) the e?ect of high levels of variable\n\nrenewable penetration on the day-ahead electricity pool market prices.\n\nFinally, conclusions arising from this study and suggestions for further work developments\n\nand improvements to the MAN-REM software, regarding the simulation of electricity trading\n\nunder a liberalised electricity market, are present in the sixth chapter.\n\n6\n\n\n\nLiberalised Electrical Energy Markets and\n\nMulti-Agent Market Simulators\n\nSince the early times of the electricity sector, scale economies and transaction cost savings\n\nachieved with vertical integrations favoured the emergence and establishment of natural mo-\n\nnopolies. This sector was therefore controlled by single public or private companies, properly\n\nregulated \u2014 since the 1980\u2019s \u2014 by state agencies [13]. In Portugal, as in many other countries,\n\nthe four key-business components of the electricity sector (generation, transmission, distribu-\n\ntion and retail) were owned by the same monopolist firm: Energias de Portugal (EDP).\n\nTraditionally, power plants were run according to central dispatch directives which en-\n\nsured the stability of the system. Regulated prices or tari?s have generally failed to signal\n\nreal generation costs, aiming above all, maximising social welfare and limiting the power held\n\nby monopolists in the market, but disregarding the fundamental e?ciency and sustainability\n\nof the industry and the correct remuneration of all interveners [14, 15].\n\nThe Electricity Pool of England and Wales appeared in 1990 as a first glance over the\n\ncoming reforms that started to occur across Europe and in the United States of America. To\n\nreplace the existing system, the British government designed a wholesale market, where all\n\ngeneration companies could sell their output on the same terms [16]. Besides the maintenance\n\nof the technical stability of the electric system, such solution also aimed the achievement of\n\na mandatory remuneration for the produced and consumed energy. Additionally, British au-\n\nthorities wanted to help participants to schedule their market positions by setting conditions\n\nto get more stable prices.\n\nIn fact, this decision has e?ectively led to significant competition in both generation and\n\nsupply sides, which was clearly demonstrated by a fall of the electricity prices to consumers of\n\nabove thirty percent [16]. As a result of this reformulation, the British model for the electricity\n\nsector was followed in many other countries, and the pool platform became a symbol of the\n\nliberalised market.\n\n7\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nIn 1996, the European Commission approved the first European Directive [17] for the\n\nenergy sector, embodying the will to liberalise its activities under the light of the above prin-\n\nciples. The Directive 96/92/EC has broaden the access conditions to networks and solved the\n\nissue of determining the cost of transmission infrastructures. Standardised rules were also set\n\nfor production, transmission and distribution. The spirit of competition ensured that con-\n\nsumers would be free to choose their electricity supplier and that new capacity should only\n\nbe allocated through authorisation or be awarded by tender [18].\n\nThe challenges posed by the liberalisation of the electricity sector are usually convergent:\n\nto abolish barriers and dismantle old monopolies, design a new architecture for the sector\u2019s\n\norganisation and improve the allocation of resources to achieve an optimum, mainly comprised\n\nof financial sustainability, improved social welfare and market e?ciency.\n\nIn this sector, the principle of dismantling vertically integrated activities into di?erent and\n\nindependent segments of the value chain emphasises three key-measures: decoupling activities\n\n(unbundling), stimulating access to the grid by third-parties, and the creation of independent\n\nregulatory authorities [18]. We should be aware that the switchover from regulated monopo-\n\nlies to competitive markets, in which consumers have the possibility to choose their supplier\n\nfreely, does not mean only the increase of the number of operators [13]. Under this scenario,\n\nthe risk for producers increases (theoretically) but, at the same time, they get greater freedom\n\nto establish their own strategies in order to maximise profits, taking into account, of course,\n\nthe behaviours of their competitors [13].\n\nDuring the late 90\u2019s, there was the conviction that developing a Single European Energy\n\nMarket would be a no easy task, given the wide variety of existing solutions in the Member\n\nStates and their variety of liberalisation degrees. Furthermore, the European geography also\n\npresents specificities that do not facilitate the interconnection of networks: it consists of a cen-\n\ntral core \u2014 France, Germany and Benelux \u2014 and peripheral regions \u2014 the UK and Ireland,\n\nScandinavia, the Italian Peninsula and the Iberian Peninsula. Weighted these constraints, it\n\nseemed preferable to draw on the experiences of existing or arising regional markets and then,\n\nfrom that point, start to build the Single European Energy Market. As a consequence of such\n\nplan, the Portuguese Government proposed to the Spanish Government, in 2000, the creation\n\nof a new regional electricity market, the MIBEL [18].\n\n8\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n2.1 Considerations on Market Competition and Regulation\n\nEnergy markets, as many others, are independently regulated. Thereby, regulators are re-\n\nsponsible for defining prices and tari?s that rule transactions between producers, retailers\n\nand consumers. As a matter of fact, regulation entities may also act as supervisors, ensuring\n\nthat all actors comply to the existing rules, and punishing them otherwise. Traditionally,\n\nstate-regulated activities intent one of the following main purposes: intervention towards a\n\nmore e?cient market or promotion of a maximised social welfare through greater equity, sol-\n\nidarity between individuals and regions, as well as guaranteeing basic social needs [19].\n\nThe relationship between cost and product valuation, made by consumers, is essential\n\nto understand and evaluate the level of e?ciency of a market. Hence, the pure seeking of\n\ne?ciency by gradually lowering the production cost of an asset is not the only condition to\n\nachieve e?ective e?cient market conditions. In every single liberalised activity, the value of a\n\ngood or service is defined by the price consumers are willing to pay in order to adquire it. As\n\na consequence, the true value of an asset is dictated by the price paid for the last consumed\n\nunit. This definition leads to the essence of the concept \u201cmarket e?ciency\u201d, which states that\n\na truly e?cient market is attained when consumers valuation of a good is equal to the exact\n\ncost at which the producer incurs to produce it \u2014 often known as marginal production cost\n\n[19].\n\n2.1.1 Traditional Market Structures\n\nMonopoly\n\nFor a long time, the electricity sector was ruled as a monopoly due to the idea that, despite\n\nthe absence of competition, it was the most e?cient operational market regime. Electricity\n\ncompanies were vertically integrated, from production to retail. Some of them can still be\n\nfound across Europe, operating now in liberalised markets as former-monopolist companies:\n\nEDP (Portugal), Enel (Italy), or EDF (France). A classic monopoly situation is achieved\n\nwhen a market is composed by a single producer or a restricted group of producers acting\n\nas a cartel. Such absence of real competition among producers was often regulated by an\n\nindependent agency in order to limit their market power over consumers and to guarantee\n\naccess to the population.\n\nOligopoly\n\nAn oligopolistic market is broadly defined as a restricted number of producers who are re-\n\nsponsible for providing a certain good or service. Due to this limited range of service/good\n\nproviding companies, some of them hold significant influence on the market, which gives them\n\n9\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nthe power to continuously influence prices. Consequently, competition is mainly punctuated\n\nby interaction strategies, not only with consumers, but most often with producers. This\n\nmarket framework has been deeply studied since the nineteenth century and often modelled\n\nby well known models such as Cournot\u2019s or Bertand\u2019s. The exercise of profit maximisation\n\nmade by producers operating in oligopolist markets gets more complex than that made by\n\nmonopolist companies. In fact, most of the times, the equilibrium situation for an oligopolist\n\nmarket often results in lower prices [3, 20].\n\nPerfect Competition\n\nIn order to exhibit characteristics of perfect competition, a market must guarantee one major\n\nrequirement: the existence of a range of both producers and consumers large enough to as-\n\nsure that none of the market participants hold su?cient market power to influence prices and\n\nquantities. This particular model also implies a perfect e?cient market, where marginal pro-\n\nduction costs equal the price consumers are willing to pay, whereas in the long-run, marginal\n\ncosts should equal minimum average production costs. Following the above premises, it is\n\nclear that a producer, in a perfectly competitive market, produces the exact quantity of a\n\ngood/service socially accepted, and thus, that consumers can absorb. Additionally, if long-\n\nrun convergence is achieved, producers are actually operating with minimum possible costs,\n\navoiding unnecessary waste and use of scarce resources.\n\n2.2 Key Market Entities\n\nThe electricity market is comprised of several key entities who ensure that households, in-\n\ndustry and services receive a proper electricity delivery service with considerable safety and\n\nreliability:\n\nGeneration Companies (GenCos) are responsible for producing electrical energy and sell\n\nit through the variety of trading mechanisms at their disposal. They can also provide a range\n\nof ancillary services to the System Operator, helping this entitiy to maintain the electrical\n\nbalance of the grid, and consequently the security of the system. GenCos can also participate\n\nin the market by buying energy to their competitors, whether for immediate delivery or to\n\ncover eventual imbalance risks. Each company can own a single power plant or a portfolio\n\nof producing units that, depending on the dimension, may provide the producer considerable\n\npower to influence the market.\n\nTransmission Companies are responsible for the operation, maintenance and development\n\nof transmission lines, transformers and reactive compensation devices. Transmission compa-\n\n10\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nnies often play the role of the Transmission System Operator. They are, by nature, the last\n\nstronghold of former monopolies, due to the enormous costs inherent to the construction of a\n\ntransmission grid.\n\nDistribution Companies own and are responsible for the operation of the distribution net-\n\nwork. Due to technical and financial constraints, and even in partially liberalised systems, the\n\ndistribution sector is hardly subject to competition. Such constraints are naturally related to\n\nthe need of having a physical grid for each competitor, which would greatly increase costs.\n\nRetailers are entities responsible for the resale of the electricity bought from producers in\n\nthe wholesale market. Since they are non-supervisor actors who do not need to own physical\n\ninfrastructures to operate, retailers have proliferated in liberalised systems. These entities\n\nbuy electricity from generation companies and use \u2014 and pay a tax for \u2014 both transmission\n\nand distribution lines in order to supply small customers, \u2018\u2019located\u201d at the end of the chain.\n\nConsumers are commonly categorised according to their level of consumption. Small con-\n\nsumers include domestic consumers and small companies which means they do not possess\n\nenough power to influence the market. Consumers in liberalised markets are free to choose the\n\nretail company to whom they agree to buy electricity. On the other hand, large consumers,\n\ndue to their dimension and consumption volumes, can operate in the wholesale market and\n\nbuy electricity directly to generation companies. In general, large consumers represent large\n\nindustrial facilities that may be directly connected to the transmission network.\n\nThe Regulator is most commonly embodied by a government agency, responsible for en-\n\nsuring the e?ciency and transparency of all operations that occur within the sector.\n\nThe Transmission System Operator (TSO) is an independent actor responsible for run-\n\nning the last resort market and balancing demand and supply in real-time towards a secure\n\nelectrical system.\n\nThe Market Operator (MO) is responsible for managing both sale and purchase bids,\n\nmatching them and guaranteeing the proper course of all trading processes. However, for\n\n-short and very-short horizon transactions, the Independent System Operator assumes the\n\nleading role.\n\n11\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n2.3 Trading Mechanisms\n\nDistinct and simultaneous forms of power trading are common in deregulated markets, en-\n\nsuring a proper technical and economical operation of the electrical sector. Power producers\n\ncan bid in the spot market and/or engage in derivative contracts with buyers, setting a le-\n\ngal contractual bond for future transactions. Generally, both methods may be adopted by\n\npower producers to maximize their profits using the available market information. Consider-\n\ning the features of deregulated markets, it is essential that power producers develop generation\n\nscheduling techniques and procedures that consider the technical characteristics of the power\n\nplants\u2019 portfolio, operation limits, production costs, maintenance costs and market behaviours\n\n(e.g., electricity prices) to maximise their benefits [1, 21].\n\n2.3.1 Spot Market\n\nThe spot market is defined by its immediacy, where sellers supply goods and buyers pay for\n\nthem with no reversibility of deals. As this market operates on a short-term horizon, both\n\nbuyers and sellers are able to adquire and o?er the exact amount of goods they need or have\n\navailable, respectively. Hereupon, scarcity of goods or sudden demand increase are rapidly\n\nmirrored by higher spot prices, enhancing the considerable volatility of prices and quantities.\n\nOn the contrary, a rise of the ratio supply/demand will therefore lead to a fall of prices [22].\n\nAs discussed in [15], these interactions ultimately lead to an equilibrium set by prices or, in\n\nother words, meeting supply and demand results in the transacted amount of a good and its\n\nprice.\n\nIdeally, electricity spot markets should operate based on forecasts of both demand and\n\nsupply, where retailers \u2014 representing medium and small consumers \u2014 and large consumers\n\nestimate their consumption for a given period in order to place their purchase bids. Likewise,\n\nproducers are responsible for setting their sale o?ers in order to fulfil a forecasted rate of con-\n\nsumption, having always in mind its profit, mostly related to production costs. In fact, such\n\ndeterministic approach to the market cannot be applied, particularly in electricity trading.\n\nGeneration units obviously su?er form sudden failures, technical problems, maintenances or\n\nother type of events that might originate unavailabilities. The same constraints are appli-\n\ncable to transmission lines that connect the electricity generation level to the grid and all\n\nthe downstream infrastructures. Additionally, the fast deployment of intermittent electricity\n\nproduction technologies with inaccurate forecasts regarding their production output exacer-\n\nbates even more this problem. Consequently, and because demand is also hardly accurately\n\npredictable, the rendering of a proper balance is specially hampered by limited and expensive\n\nstorage capacity of potencial energy in water reservoirs, batteries or through high-rampage\n\n12\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\ngeneration technologies, such as CCGT systems or more modern and flexible coal-fired power\n\nplants [23].\n\nPool Market\n\nThe pool platform is a representative cornerstone of the liberalised electricity market philos-\n\nophy. The creation of this trading mechanism envisioned the establishment of a transparent,\n\ne?cient, flexible and competitive wholesale market that could provide guarantees to produc-\n\ners, retailers and consumers. Although pool markets are very unusually adopted as trading\n\nmechanisms in commodity markets, they are very well established in electricity systems. One\n\nof the main features of a pool platform is the absence of a negotiation process between two\n\n(or more) parties and, therefore, the transaction process occurs with absolutely no reliance on\n\niterative attempts to reach an agreement. Despite some circunstancial di?erences that may\n\nbe verified from one market to another, pool sessions usually follow the following procedures:\n\n1. Generation companies submit selling bids for a certain amount of electrical energy at a\n\ncertain price;\n\n2. Similarly, large consumers and retailers submit purchase orders, specifying both quan-\n\ntities and prices they are willing to pay for each energy unit.\n\n3. The market operator ranks both purchase and sale bids in order to get a purchasing-price\n\ncrescent curve and a selling-price decrescent curve, respectively (see Figure 2.1).\n\n4. The intersection point of the two curves is computed by the market operator and re-\n\nsults in the \u201cmarket clearing point\u201d (MCP), whose coordinates represent the \u201cmarket\n\nmarginal price\u201d (MMP) and the total tradable energy volume. Therefore, the market\n\noperator accepts all generators\u2019 o?ers which are bellow the MMP [24] and, consequently,\n\nall GenCos located on the left side of the market clearing point see their production of-\n\nfers accepted and are required to supply the proposed volumes of electricity. For the\n\nsake of classification, o?ers to the market whose price is bellow the MMP are \u201cin merit\u201d.\n\nProducers whose o?erings are on the right side of the intersection \u2014 \u201cout of merit\u201d \u2014\n\nwill be excluded for the respective market\u2019s spanning period.\n\nFrom this point on, several versions of a pool auction may be found, depending on the\n\nspecific electricity market configuration. With regard to the o?ered prices by each generation\n\nentity, two main variations may be encountered: in a price-based auction, generators can bid\n\nat any price they find appropriated, whereas in a cost-based auction, prices should reflect the\n\ninherent marginal costs of each particular unit. Similarly, a pool can also be di?erentiated\n\n13\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 2.1: Typical supply and demand curves in a pool market session\n\nby its initial operating assumptions and be referred to as one-sided or two-sided: in a one-\n\nsided auction, the demand level is predicted by the market operator, based on the theoretical\n\nconcept of market inelasticity and historical records, and hence all o?ers from producers are\n\ncleared against this demand assumption, with no input contribution from buyers. On the\n\ncontrary, in a two-sided auction, the market operator\u2019s dispatch is based on both buyer\u2019s de-\n\nmanded quantity and the supply o?ered by sellers.\n\nFinally, a pool platform can also operate according to two opposed remuneration philoso-\n\nphies (Figure 2.2): in a single-price auction, \u201cin merit\u201d participants (buyers and sellers) pay\n\nand are paid in accordance to the resulting market marginal price, whereas in a pay-as-bid\n\nauction, \u201cin merit\u201d generators are paid the exact price they had individually submitted to the\n\nmarket operator.\n\nBoth trading models have strengths and weaknesses. In pay-as-bid auctions, certain be-\n\nhaviours are more likely to occur in order to influence the MMP (upwardly). A classic situation\n\nis observed when a generator who owns a power plant with a given marginal cost, knowing that\n\nthe forecasted MMP for the next auction is significantly higher than his marginal production\n\ncosts, bids at a selling price substantially above his marginal cost, having nearly the same\n\nchances of getting his o?er accepted. As discussed in [15], a pay-as-bid scheme is often not\n\nadopted because it discourages generators from placing o?ers that reflect their marginal costs.\n\nGenCos would then try to guess the forthcoming MMP and would bid at that level of prices,\n\nattempting to maximise their revenues. Also, in a pay-as-bid situation, the absence of a single\n\nprice to rule the purchase of an asset assumes a critical dimension when a price indicator is\n\nneeded whether for statistical ends or as a benchmark for setting bilateral contracts [1].\n\n14\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 2.2: Pay-as-bid vs single-price systems in a pool market\n\nAncillaries Market\n\nAs already discussed, the balance of the electrical system is of capital importance. Therefore,\n\nin order to maintain the integrity of the system without compromising the electricity supply,\n\nthe transmission system operator (TSO) controls a set of balancing tools, which are gener-\n\nally categorised according to their timescale e?ectiveness. Spot markets usually comprise one\n\ndaily market \u2014 day-ahead \u2014 where participants bid their purchase and sale o?ers for the\n\nnext twenty-four hours. A smoother maintenance of this balance is achieved, over the day,\n\nby the intraday market, thats aims to harmonise some natural fluctuations, allowing both\n\nproducers and consumers to adjust their positions.\n\nAlthough minor momentaneous imbalances do not represent a major security issue, they\n\nmust be promptly detected and corrected, since frequency variations tend to weaken the sys-\n\ntem, making it much less resilient to further technical complications that may occur, harming\n\nits stability.\n\nSuch adjustments require the existence of a bench of backup units which can be \u201ccalled\u201d\n\nto perform corrective actions on production. This reserve is often subdivided into \u201cspinning\n\nreserve\u201d and \u201cnon-spinning reserve\u201d. Spinning reserve is distinguished by its quick response,\n\nwhich may vary up to ten minutes, and is fundamentally oriented for frequency services \u2014\n\nmeant for constant frequency regulation. Therefore, and because of the haste these correc-\n\ntions require, such generation facilities are commonly equipped with a governor system which\n\nallows a direct and automated control of its power output by the ISO. On the other hand,\n\nthe non-spinning reserve consists of production units with lower response rates \u2014 up to sixty\n\nminutes \u2014 and are specially designed to handle slower (but usually larger) fluctuations, par-\n\nticularly during intra-period oscillations \u2014 the following services.\n\n15\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n2.3.2 Bilateral Contracts Market\n\nBilateral trading constitutes a mechanism for energy transactions where two parties negotiate\n\nand get an agreement without the intervention of third-parties. In transactions via bilateral\n\ncontracts, almost all conditions \u2014 including price, time of delivery and energy volumes \u2014\n\nare dependent of the goals and concession tolerance of each intervenient in the negotiation.\n\nCustomised long-term bilateral contracts are flexible and negotiated privately to meet the\n\nneeds of both parties. They usually involve the sale of large amounts of power over long\n\nperiods of time due to large transaction costs associated with the negotiation of such contracts,\n\nmaking them worthwhile only when the parties want to buy or sell large amounts of energy.\n\nOn the other hand, short-term bilateral contracts, celebrated within a short maturity horizon,\n\nare classified as spot market operations and usually adopt one of the following concepts:\n\n\u2022 Trading \u2019Over-the-Counter\u2019 is a mechanism specially designed for the necessary adjust-\nments to eventual assumed positions through long-term agreements. Producers and\n\nconsumers can perform corrective actions to their previous perspectives for a given pe-\n\nriod, towards an equilibrium between demand and supply. The nature of this market\n\nmakes it a low-volume energy transactions\u2019 mechanism.\n\n\u2022 Electronic Trading is an electronic platform where buyers and sellers can send their\no?ers to the market. Typically, each bid comprises four main features: order (purchase\n\nor sale), period of delivery, energy amount and energy price. When a participant sends\n\nan o?er to this computerised platform, the system seeks for other submitted o?ers that\n\nmay be matchable with it. If the matching happens to be impossible, the o?er is added\n\nto a queue list, waiting for further o?ers that may clear it. The electronic trading is\n\ncommonly used for fine-tuning of the participants positions, some minutes before the\n\nmarket closure.\n\nBilateral contracts evolved and greatly expanded over recent years. The MIBEL, as well\n\nas other electricity markets, is an example of the increasing relevance that bilateral contracts\n\nhave to market participants. Besides the main goal of risk-reduction, BC present also some\n\npositive collateral e?ects [25], as providing greater stability in spot markets, and the curtail-\n\nment of potential market power situations and reduction of demand fluctuations. Although\n\npool markets and BC are distinct mechanisms of trading, they are naturally related and can\n\nbe used to take advantage from price variations and market speculation, providing an extra\n\nsource of income. Energy bought in the pool market can satisfy the bilateral deals assumed\n\nby the producer, if such prices prove to be lower than the inherent marginal costs for energy\n\nproduction. Similarly, if a producer holds a position benefiting from bilaterally contracted\n\npower, he might find it financially beneficial to resell part of this power in the pool, aiming\n\nat obtaining a significant profit [25].\n\n16\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n2.3.3 Derivatives Market\n\nThe mitigation of possible harmful e?ects from sudden changes in market conditions has led\n\nto the appearance of derivative products, which induce more predictability and reduce risk\n\nexposure. These instruments are most commonly found as legal private transaction contracts\n\nestablishing agreed quantities and negotiated prices for a certain asset. In fact, some of these\n\ncontracts can be highly complex, to a point that contracted quantities and prices may vary\n\nhourly or according to existing intraday tari?s [26].\n\nThe market transactions can be physical or purely financial. On one hand, financial trans-\n\nactions are cash-settled, with the cashflows calculated through formulas referencing energy\n\nprices established in di?erent markets (and possibly other prices and variables). On the other\n\nhand, physical transactions require the delivery of physical electricity, for instance spot trans-\n\nactions are, by definition, physical transactions. These transactions are often structured using\n\nthe templates developed for the financial markets, including swaps and options [1]. Some of\n\nthe most vulgar derivatives mechanisms are presented and briefly explained below:\n\n\u2022 Forward contracts are one of the simplest derivative mechanisms and involve agreements\non energy volumes and prices, for future transaction events, on previously scheduled de-\n\nlivery dates. Further details are also usually safeguarded, such as energy quality and\n\npenalties for default. Therefore, this tool allows two parties to set an agreed price of a\n\ngiven volume of energy, capping eventual losses which may occur in future pool market\n\nsessions, if the evolution is not favourable. For instance, if a buyer is trying to prevent\n\nthe e?ects of an eventual price escalade, he might be willing to pay a higher amount\n\nthan the current energy price in order to reduce his exposure to price variations. This\n\ndi?erence between the expected pool price and the contracted price is often called the\n\n\u201cpremium\u201d, and reflects the price producers are willing to pay in order to have pre-\n\ndictable and controlled selling prices over a given period of time. When contracts are\n\nsigned, buyers assume a \u201clong position\u201d, while sellers take on a \u201cshort position\u201d [15, 27].\n\n\u2022 Options contracts can be materialised as \u201ccall options\u201d or \u201cput options\u201d. A call option\ndefines the allocation of a buying right of a certain asset at a certain price (strike-price)\n\nto its holder, whereas the owners of a put option detain the legal right to sell their\n\nasset according to the conditions stated on the contract [27]. Contracts can be designed\n\nconsidering a single-day execution date (\u201cEuropean options\u201d) or over a ranging period\n\nwith a given expiration date (maturity) (\u201cAmerican options\u201d).\n\n17\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n\u2022 Future contracts assume themselves, in the energy market landscape, as an opportunity\nfor non-energy firms to take advantage from the considerable volatility of prices in en-\n\nergy markets. Future contracts do not carry any physical delivery of energy associated\n\nand, therefore, contribute only for market speculation. Accordingly, speculators buy\n\nand sell \u201cpaper energy\u201d, trying to profit with future price oscillations that may occur\n\nbefore reaching the maturity expiration date. Since some of the participants enrolled in\n\nfutures are neither consumers nor producers, as the date of delivery approaches, contract\n\nholders have to balance their position in the physical market (either buying or selling).\n\n\u2022 Contracts for Di?erences ( CfD\u2019s) are purely financial-driven contracts, not involving\nany physical transaction of electrical energy, and used to mitigate the exposure to price\n\nvariations. The two subscribers of a CfD agree upon a strike-price for the thereafter\n\ntraded energy. Consequently, both parts have the legal right to be compensated by each\n\nother whenever they sell/buy energy at a lower/higher price than the agreed strike-price\n\n[28].\n\n2.4 E?ect of Renewables on the Electricity Spot Market\n\nCurrently, at a time when the penetration of renewable energy technologies is already ex-\n\ntremely relevant in many countries (see Figure 2.3), another phenomenon arising from the\n\nmass production of \u201cnon-conventional\u201d intermittent electricity has undergone a deep study\n\nand some discussion: the influence that non-dispatchable technologies \u2014 wind and solar in\n\nparticular \u2014 have on electricity market prices [29, 30].\n\nIn pool markets, as explained in detail in Section 2.3, market operators aggregate pur-\n\nchase and sale o?ers, previously submitted by buyers and sellers, sorting them according to\n\na meritocratic hierarchy which sets the price and amount of the electricity traded. From the\n\ntime when this mechanism was primordially designed, in the early 1990\u2019s, until now, reality\n\nhas being severely changing due to renewables deployment [31].\n\nAt the origin of these changes is the sorting logic of production units: based on operational\n\nexpenditures (OPEX) \u2014 very dependent on the cost of fuels and susceptible to rapid changes\n\nin extraordinarily limited time periods. Thus, marginal costs of fuel-fired power plants are\n\nclosely related to the price of commodities in the market, being possible to establish a link\n\nbetween the evolution of the plants\u2019 operating costs and the price of fuels.\n\n18\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 2.3: Annual wind power installation in the EU (2004-2014) [29]\n\nContrary, costs from photovoltaic or wind technologies are mainly influenced by capital\n\nexpenditures (CAPEX), due to the large initial investments needed for construction and lim-\n\nited capacity factors. Given that, the OPEX of wind projects can be considered a minor cost\n\nin comparison to its CAPEX, particularly due to \u201cfree fuel\u201d [32].\n\nThe combination of this bidding selection process with the fact that the marginal costs of\n\nwind or PV generation are considerably lower, led \u2014 over the years \u2014 to a change of the tradi-\n\ntional shape of the supply curve. Despite frequent assumptions of null marginal costs for wind\n\npower production, it is essencial to account operation and maintenance variable costs (O&amp;M)\n\nwhich include predictive maintenance \u2014 activities performed on equipments expected to fail\n\nsoon, typically based on the results of condition based monitoring \u2014 and corrective mainte-\n\nnance \u2014 performed to repair equipments that are damaged or underperforming. Depending\n\non the literature and also on the specific characteristics of each electric grid, estimations of\n\nmarginal costs may vary considerably [33, 34], being estimated to range up to 12 e/MWh.\n\nMoreover, costs arising from the integration of this type of technology into the electricity\n\nsystem were also considered and comprise [35]:\n\n\u2022 Additional system reserve costs:\n\n\u2013 Additional requirements for instantaneous and frequency keeping reserves;\n\n\u2013 Additional requirements for scheduling reserve;\n\n\u2022 Additional system generation capacity costs;\n\n\u2022 Transmission constraints and reinforcement costs driven by wind power.\n\nHence, total wind power marginal costs were estimated below 14 e/MWh.\n\n19\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nThrough the following historical data records of three \u201ccharacteristic days\u201d, one can in-\n\nstinctively understand the referred e?ect of wind production in MIBEL pool prices: the\n\n22thApril, 2013 \u2014 medium wind production (Pav = 1 483 MW) \u2014, the 8\nthDecember, 2013 \u2014\n\nlow wind production (Pav = 64 MW) \u2014 and the 4\nthJanuary, 2014 \u2014 high wind production\n\n(Pav = 2 950 MW).\n\nFigure 2.4 illustrates a medium wind production day with an average hourly output of\n\n1 483 MW, whereas Figure 2.5 illustrates a low wind-based electricity generation characteristic\n\nday with an average hourly output of sixty-four megawatt, and Figure 2.6 depicts a high wind\n\nproduction day with an average output of 2 950 MW \u2014 corresponding to capacity factors of\n\nabout 1.3%, 32.0% and 65.0% of the Portuguese installed capacity, respectively [7].\n\nBy analysing Figures 2.4, 2.5 and 2.6, it turns easier to understand the subjacent e?ect of\n\nhigh wind production \u2014 whose marginal costs are below of any other traditional technology.\n\nHigh wind production, here represented by Figure 2.6, causes a shift of the traditional capacity\n\nto the right-side of the MCP (assuming an electricity market where demand is approximately\n\ninelastic). Examining the changes induced by the introduction of wind production, a major\n\ne?ect is easily distinguishable: a decline of the marginal market price. This e?ect is often\n\nknown as \u201cmerit of order e?ect\u201d [36].\n\nBy comparing both annual maximum and minimum wind generation days, the correlation\n\nbetween wind production and pool prices is even more evident: while on the 8th December,\n\nwith very low wind production output, hourly prices in MIBEL ranged from 83.4 e/MWh\n\nto 111.0 e/MWh, on the 4th January, the high production output from wind farms led to\n\nextremely low pool prices in the Iberian market, ranging from 0.0 e/MWh to 19.0 e/MWh.\n\nAn intermediate case, represented by the case of 22th of April, shows an average production\n\nsituation where the outcoming prices were around 25.0 e/MWh.\n\nThrough this example (not necessarily simplistic), it can be concluded that wind power\n\ncontributes for considerable energy cost savings. Therefore, it follows that a substantial pres-\n\nence of wind technologies in the market may lead to increased overall e?ciency of the pool\n\nmechanism, resulting in a significantly lower MMP [36, 37].\n\n20\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 2.4: Medium wind production scenario (22thApril, 2013) [7, 38, 39]\n\nFigure 2.5: Low wind production scenario (8thDecember, 2013) [7, 38, 39]\n\nFigure 2.6: High wind production scenario (4thJanuary, 2014) [7, 38, 39]\n\n21\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nHowever, despite going beyond the scope of this work, it should be emphasised that this\n\neconomy \u2014 due to lower pool prices \u2014 may not be a net gain for consumers and, hence,\n\nit should be holistically analysed. Some studies were carried out on this matter with the\n\nintention of finding out whether there is a net benefit from the socio-economical optimisation\n\nperspective arising from high penetration of wind power, being many of them contradictory.\n\nIn a study, Azofra et al. [40] essentially focus on the Spanish electricity generation system,\n\nand conclude that, despite the feed-in tari?s guaranteed to renewable energy producers \u2014\n\nindirectly supported by consumers \u2014 the significant reduction of the market marginal price\n\nresults in significant savings for consumers.\n\nOn the other hand, Mulder et al. [41] focused on the Dutch electricity market and con-\n\ncluded that the reduction of the electricity retail price is not necessarily an evidence, since a\n\nclear gain for the consumers cannot be admitted. However, this study admits the possibility\n\nthat the low preponderance of renewable technologies in the Dutch electrical production sys-\n\ntem might be the cause of such ine?ectiveness.\n\n2.5 The Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL)\n\nThe Iberian Electricity Market (MIBEL) results from the cooperation of the Portuguese and\n\nSpanish Governments, aiming to promote a better integration of both countries\u2019 electrical\n\nsystems. Its significant contribution for the establishment of an integrated electricity market,\n\nnot only at the Iberian level but, also at the European scale, is an important step to take on\n\nthe pathway towards the envisioned \u201cenergy union\u201d [42].\n\nThis market was fully launched on 1st July 2007 and is subdivided into two main poles: the\n\nOMIE \u2014 from the Spanish side \u2014 and the OMIP \u2014 from the Portuguese side. Despite the\n\nfact that MIBEL is an unified electricity market, the OMIE takes responsibility for the spot\n\nmarket clearance, whereas the OMIP ensures the management of the bilateral agreements,\n\nincluding forwards, futures and options.\n\nThe joint regulation of the Iberian electricity market is operated by \u201cERSE - Entidade\n\nReguladora dos Servic?os Energe?ticos\u201d and \u201cCMVM - Comissa?o do Mercado de Valores Mobil-\n\nia?rios\u201d, in Portugal, and by \u201cCNE - Comisio?n Nacional de Energ??a\u201d and \u201cCNMV - Comisio?n\n\nNacional del Mercado de Valores\u201d in Spain.\n\nRegarding the transmission industry, the Iberian market is composed by two major com-\n\npanies, the \u201cREN - Rede Ele?ctrica Nacional\u201d and the \u201cREE - Red Ele?ctrica de Espana?\u201d, which\n\n22\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nare also responsible for the market operation. Distribution is, in Portugal, guaranteed by the\n\nmonopolist company \u201cEDP - Energias de Portugal\u201d whereas in Spain, regional monopolist\n\ncompanies such as Union Fenosa, Endesa, Iberdrola and HC Energia are the providers of this\n\nservice.\n\n2.5.1 Market Organisation\n\nCurrently, the OMIE manages day-ahead and intraday transactions as well as real-time trans-\n\nactions for Portugal and Spain. As this is a joint market, bids from both Portuguese and\n\nSpanish sellers and buyers are aggregated and cleared in single auctions. This method often\n\nleads to uniform electricity pricing on both sides. However, despite the fact that all o?ers to\n\nthe market are handled disregarding their origin, it is still not unusual to witness disparities\n\namong Portuguese and Spanish spot prices. Price decoupling and its consequent price spread\n\nis mostly caused by the exhaustion of the transmission capacity between territories, leading\n\nto nodal regional prices (see Figure 2.8).\n\nThe day-ahead and intraday markets represent the two main mechanisms for energy trans-\n\naction in the spot market, organised by the OMIE. The day-ahead regime allows both buyers\n\nand sellers to trade energy according to their perspectives of demand loads and renewables\n\nproduction forecasts. Procedures for a regular pool market auction start with a twelve-hour\n\nadvance from the beginning of the next day, meaning that supply- and demand-side agents\n\nmust communicate their market actions to the market operator until 12:00h of the previous\n\nday (d-1)\n\nProducers and retailers place their selling and buying bids, which are then arranged ac-\n\nFigure 2.7: Day-ahead and intra-day market sessions [42]\n\n23\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\ncording to the proposed prices and used to draw the demand and supply curves [1, 24, 43].\n\nHowever, due to natural oscillations either on the demand and supply sides or to unforeseen\n\ntechnical constraints, additional trading platforms with much shorter maturities provide es-\n\nsential adjustment services, smoothing the e?ects of sudden events.\n\nThe intraday adjustment tool is provided by the market operator and comprises six daily\n\nsessions where buyers and sellers can adjust their positions to the real course of both demand\n\nand supply (Figure 2.7):\n\n\u2022 1st Session \u2014 closes at 20.00h of day d ? 1 and clears the market for the remaining four\nhours of day d ? 1 and for the next 24 hours of day d;\n\n\u2022 2nd Session \u2014 closes at 00.00h of day d and clears the next 24 hours of day d;\n\n\u2022 3rd Session \u2014 closes at 5.00h of day d and clears the market for the next 20 hours of\nday d;\n\n\u2022 4th Session \u2014 closes at 8.00h of day d and clears the market for the next 17 hours of\nday d;\n\n\u2022 5th Session \u2014 closes at 12.00h of day d and clears the market for the next 13 hours of\nday d;\n\n\u2022 6th Session \u2014 closes at 16.00h of day d and clears the market for the next 9 hours of day d.\n\nIn addition to the spot market platforms for electricity trading made available by the\n\nSpanish pole of the MIBEL (OMIE), the Iberian Energy Derivatives Exchange, through the\n\nOMIP, provides a large set of derivative products such as futures, swaps, forwards and options.\n\nA wide number of contractual products with di?erent specificities allows traders to negotiate\n\nin maturity periods ranging from days, weeks, months, up to quadrenniums. Characteristics of\n\nsuch contractual bonds, physical and financial, are extensively described stating, for example,\n\nwhether a contract concerns base-load or peak period energy, tick volumes or the method of\n\ncash payments [44].\n\n2.5.2 Market Main Indicators\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula and, therefore, the MIBEL, are fairly well equipped with intracon-\n\nnections linking Portugal and Spain. However, they are still quite regionally isolated and\n\nfar from the interconnection ratios commonly found across central and northern Europe: in-\n\nterconnections with Morocco and France amount 2.4% of the overall MIBEL\u2019s generation\n\ncapacity, constraining exchange operations with neighbouring markets and making it impos-\n\nsible to export wind power generation surplus. Because a proper market union can only be\n\n24\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nfully achieved under a scenario of comfortable net interconnection capacity to accommodate\n\ntransactions defined by the market, intra- and interconnection developments have been one\n\nof the main consensuses among national authorities and the European Commission. In fact,\n\nimproved MIBEL\u2019s intraconnections \u2014 connecting Portugal and Spain \u2014 have decreased the\n\ne?ect of price decoupling (Figure 2.8) and increased the price-coupling between these two\n\ncountries, reducing significantly the number of hours when locational prices were registered.\n\nAccordingly, 97.6% of price-coupling in the day-ahead market was registered in 2015.\n\nThe Iberian generation system is naturally composed by the sum of the installed capacity\n\nin the two Iberian countries. By the end of 2014, this overall capacity rounded 125 595 MW,\n\nwith a contribution of 19 125 MW from the Portuguese side and 106 470 MW from the Span-\n\nish side [7].\n\nDespite the recent deployment of CO2-free electricity generation technologies, combustible\n\nfuels still play an important role in MIBEL, with a capacity share of 46.1% (2014), signifi-\n\ncantly comprised by coal and natural gas facilities. A closer look at the evolution of generation\n\ncapacities unveils a consistent growth of natural gas. Coal and gas usage is highly variable in\n\nthe Iberian countries due to their direct dependence on renewable production to meet demand\n\nand, therefore, on wet and/or windy years.\n\nImprovements on hydro capacity were a must regarding the safety of the grid\u2019s manage-\n\nment and balance. Pumping capacity in the Iberian countries represented 13.9% of the peak\n\ndemand and 23.6% of the overall wind capacity in 2014 [7]. Portugal\u2019s pumping capacity\n\nhas registered a growth of 57.0%, representing 24.8% of the overall hydro capacity in 2014.\n\nAccording to [45], the Portuguese authorities plan to add 1 837 MW of new hydro capacity\n\nby 2017 \u2014 including 1 295 MW of reversible capacity \u2014 and an additional capacity of 1 100\n\nMW (reversible) by 2022.\n\nWind generation is high in Portugal and Spain due to the optimal resource conditions:\n\nMIBEL\u2019s wind capacity was significantly deployed, growing 213.8%, from 8 870 MW in 2004\n\nto 27 831 MW in 2014, and accounting for 21.9% of the overall capacity and 59.9% of the\n\npeak demand capacity (2014).\n\nPortugal and Spain have considerably su?ered with the outbreak of the European finan-\n\ncial crisis in the late 2008 \u2014 and subsequent economic cool down and shrinkage \u2014 and have\n\nregistered a significant fall on electricity demand since then (8.1%). This situation, enhanced\n\nby a decoupling of some level between the economic growth and the energy consumption,\n\nhas increased even more the representativity of variable generation, meaning solar and wind\n\n25\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 2.8: Implications of interconnection capacity on MIBEL\u2019s price coupling (19Jan2013 - 25Jan2013) [5]\n\npower production shares (4.3% and 19.5% in 2014).\n\nRenewables, particularly wind and solar power, have been specially deployed in European\n\ncountries. In 2014, Portugal (25.4%) and Spain (21.6%) were the World\u2019s leaders on wind\n\npenetration, right after Denmark. Production variability is managed by relying on hydro\n\npumping and gas-fired capacity to constantly balance the production.\n\nAlso in 2014, the electricity generated in Portugal from wind reached 22.9% and was the\n\nsecond largest contributor for electricity supply after hydropower. On its turn, Spain\u2019s elec-\n\ntricity generation registered a 18,8% contribution from wind, making it the third main source\n\nof generation after hydro and nuclear power. On the other hand, solar capacity for electricity\n\nproduction has registered a 113.8% growth, reaching 7 502 MW in 2014. However, only 5.5%\n\nof this capacity is located in Portugal. In 2014, solar power contributed with 4.3% of the\n\ngenerated electricity in the MIBEL region [6].\n\nDespite the fact that the pool day-ahead market is the trading mechanism by excellence in\n\na liberalised market, the great majority of energy transactions in both countries through the\n\nMIBEL were traded via derivatives market. This situation is highly comprehensible since no\n\nproducer nor consumer wants to be at the mercy of pool price fluctuations and, consequently,\n\nsetting bilateral agreements with other parties, with controllable strike-prices, reduces opera-\n\ntion risks [5].\n\nAt the same time, we have been assisting to a downward trend on MIBEL\u2019s daily average\n\nprices, as well as to the convergence between Portuguese and Spanish prices \u2014 which has only\n\nbeen possible because of the reinforced net capacity between both countries [39].\n\n26\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 2.9: Electricity generation in Portugal and Spain, by source (2004-2014) [6]\n\n2.6 Agents and Multi-Agent Systems\n\nAgent-based modelling and simulation (ABMS) is a relatively new approach of modelling com-\n\nplex systems composed of interacting, autonomous agents. Agent-based systems may contain\n\ntwo or more agents, constituting multi-agent systems. Moreover, a typical agent-based system\n\nstands on three main pillars: agents, interactions and the environment.\n\nAn agent is defined by its capacity to act autonomously, meaning it can act on its own,\n\nresponding to the environment, without the intervention of humans or other agents. Au-\n\ntonomous agents are responsive, meaning that they should perceive their environment and\n\nconsequently respond to changes that may occur in it. They can also be pro-active, since\n\ntheir goal-seeking nature doesn\u2019t allow them to assume a simply reactive posture, being able\n\nto exhibit opportunistic behaviour and take the initiative. Generally speaking, agents are\n\nindividuals that interact with their peers and even with humans, in order to complete their\n\nown problem solving [46].\n\nDespite the above, some agents may be created with only a reactive purpose, which means\n\nthat such individuals interact by making no use of historical or learning processes, responding\n\n27\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nexclusively to impulses from the environment [47].\n\nAgents interact according to their portfolio of pre-designed possible actions, which may\n\ninfluence their environment (Figure 2.10). However, those actions may be subject to prelimi-\n\nnary conditions, which ensure that the agents can e?ectively proceed in specific ways. Hence,\n\nthe actions of an agent are often associated with pre-conditions which define the possible\n\nsituation where they can be applied [47]. The mutual interaction among agents characterises\n\nsocial systems, where individuals are influenced and learn the other\u2019s actions, and adapt their\n\nbehaviours to be more harmonised with the environment. Interactions between agents can\n\nrange in a variety of natures [46]:\n\n\u2022 Cooperation \u2014 agents assume a partnership that can take them to their common aim;\n\n\u2022 Coordination \u2014 agents organise a problem solving activity in order to avoid harmful\ninteractions and to exploit beneficial ones;\n\n\u2022 Negotiation \u2014 agents define a set of conditions that must be agreed by all in order to\ncome to an agreement.\n\nNegotiation is a bulk issue when it takes to agents interactions. When in a negotiation\n\nsituation, agents must be designed to be able to solve di?erences and conflicts through ne-\n\ngotiation towards a good coordination of their activities. In multi-agent systems, negotiation\n\nrequires that agents participate in a hole of chained actions which might permit a conflict\n\nresolution. Agents, therefore, prepare and plan their negotiation interactions. Secondly, they\n\nshould generate, evaluate and exchange o?ers with its pairs and then, if possible, come to an\n\nagreement with the involved parties. The demand for an agreement between parties leads to\n\nthe development of negotiation strategies which are supposed to lead to a beneficial agree-\n\nment that can be as closer as possible of the agent\u2019s initial goals. According to [48], those\n\nbehaviours can be mainly categorised as Concession Making and Problem Solving.\n\nThe first is a characteristic behaviour of an agent who possesses a given concession factor,\n\nwhich defines its willingness to sacrifice part of its initial goals, reducing its aspirations, to-\n\nwards a consensus among the intervenient parties. On the other hand, the second behaviour\n\nis typical of an agent who assumes a more interesting posture regarding its primordial aims,\n\nmaintaining its goals and aspirations and confining itself to conciliate them with others\u2019 aspi-\n\nrations.\n\nAgent-based modelling is widely used in a large variety of areas, ranging from stock mar-\n\nkets and supply chains, to predicting the spread of epidemics and the threat of bio-warfare,\n\nvia understanding the fall of ancient civilisations to modelling engagement of forces on bat-\n\ntlefields or at sea [49]. Pedestrian crowd movements, transportation infrastructures, financial\n\n28\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 2.10: Typical agent [50]\n\nmarkets, cell behaviours, population dynamics and even markets that do not exist yet, are also\n\ncommonly studied and tested through agent-based systems. Such models can be developed\n\nusing specific software toolkits (e.g. JADE). General programming languages, such as Python,\n\nJAVA and C++, can also be used with the advantage of providing specific capabilities for\n\nmodelling agents [50].\n\n2.6.1 Multi-Agent Simulators for Energy Markets\n\nThis subsection introduces some of the existing multi-agent simulators namely, EMCAS,\n\nSEPIA, MASCEM and AMES.\n\nEMCAS\n\nThe Electricity Market Complex Adaptive System (EMCAS) simulator was developed\n\nby researchers from the Argonne National Laboratory (US Department of Energy) with\n\nthe aim to study the evolution of the electrical system, consequences of competition on\n\nthe variation of market prices as well as to assess operational limits and security criteria\n\nof the grid [51].\n\nThe EMCAS allows one to simulate the behaviour of agents enrolled in several types\n\nof electricity markets, such as the pool market and the bilateral contracts market, and\n\nconstrains their activities according to eventual operational limitations of the system.\n\nProducers, consumers, distributers, market operators, the independent system operator\n\n29\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nand transmission entities are all represented by agents who are able to adapt their be-\n\nhaviour in order to achieve success or avoid prior failures as well as to make decisions,\n\nlearn and adapt their strategies (e.g. biding strategies) to the environment based on\n\nhistorical records [52, 53]. In fact, this simulator is widely used by real-world companies\n\nacross the globe, being used, for instance, by REN - Rede Ele?ctrica Nacional, to study\n\nand analyse the MIBEL.\n\nSEPIA\n\nSEPIA, standing for Simulator for the Electric Power Industry Agents, is a tool designed\n\nby Honeywell Technology Center and the University of Minnesota specifically oriented\n\nto bilateral contracts for trading electricity. Similarly to others, this an agent-based\n\ntool that aims to analyse the behaviours of all participants in the electricity market.\n\nSEPIA requires power specifications (generation and load), determines the operational\n\nlimitations of the system and foresees eventual discrepancies on the security criteria that\n\nhave been defined. Agents aim to model physical entities such as producers, consumers\n\nand system operators. Consumer agents define and provide their load profiles, stating\n\nthe amount of electrical energy they are willing to buy, and interact with generation\n\nagents in order to define the contractual terms and conditions for the trade, such as\n\nprice and quantity. Once both parties agree upon a specific contract, their decision is\n\nsent to the system operator, who is responsible for checking whether this transaction\n\ncan be physically accomplished within the boundaries considered acceptable to run the\n\nelectric grid safely [51].\n\nMASCEM\n\nDeveloped by the Grupo de Investigac?a?o em Engenharia do Conhecimento e Apoio a?\n\nDecisa?o (GECAD) of the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP), the MA-\n\nSCEM simulator is a JAVA-based multi-agent simulator. Being a software to support\n\ndecision-making, the MASCEM allows users to evaluate agents\u2019 decisions, on di?erent\n\nmarkets, particularly on pool market and bilateral contracts. Agents\u2019 modelling of pro-\n\nducers, consumers, retailers, market operators, system operators and facilitators (whose\n\nfunction is to coordinate and supervise simulations) is based on artificial intelligence [54].\n\nSimulations may occur according to di?erent bidding strategies such as time-wise dy-\n\nnamic strategies, strategies dependent on other agents\u2019 behaviours, historical market\n\nrecords and historical agents\u2019 decisions records [55].\n\nAMES\n\nThe Agent-based Modelling of Electricity Systems (AMES) was designed, by the Uni-\n\nversity of Iowa, USA, after the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\u2019s (FERC)\n\n30\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nsuggestion for the restructuring of the wholesale electricity market in 2013 [56]. AMES\n\nis an open-source software developed under the JAVA programming language where\n\nagents, particularly producers, possess learning skills. This simulator runs the whole-\n\nsale electricity market for a predefined period of time with a minimum scale of one hour\n\nwhich allows to reduce forecast errors induced by the volatility of prices inherent to an\n\nelectricity market. The software comprises generation agents (GenCos), retail agents\n\n(LSEs) and the system operator.\n\nGenCos are assumed profit-seekers and exclusive sellers, which means that, unlike in the\n\nreal world, electricity producers cannot buy electrical energy in the market. Learning\n\ncapacities and generation technologies are an input to this simulator \u2014 allowing to de-\n\ntermine production costs that are sent to the system operator whenever a GenCo bids in\n\nthe market. Such marginal costs can be presented in the form of a costs curve above the\n\nreal costs of the producer, a behaviour that is typically observed when generators want\n\nto reduce risk exposure and maximise profits. Declaring a generation capacity below\n\ntheir real one is also a mechanism used by GenCos to lead to higher market prices [57].\n\nThe Load-serving entities (LSEs), or in other words the retailers are, unlike GenCos,\n\nunable to learn. They aim to satisfy their demand for electrical energy by sending buy-\n\ning o?ers to the system operator with respect to the twenty-four hours of the next day.\n\nThe system operator (OS) is responsible for managing the wholesale energy market, seek-\n\ning, above everything else, to maximise the global gain of the system, which is defined as\n\nTotal Net Surplus in the AMES software. After receiving the GenCos\u2019 and LSEs\u2019 o?ers\n\nfor the next day (D+1), the OS determines the prices of each of the twenty-four intervals.\n\n31\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n32\n\n\n\nPortfolio Optimisation and Self-Scheduling\n\nModels\n\nThe following suggested deterministic models describe three di?erent ways of computing op-\n\ntimised selling settlements of GenCo\u2019s production depending on the nature of their portfolios.\n\nSince all considered methods maximise the overall profit over a given period, they require\n\nsimilar input data:\n\n\u2022 Technical specifications of all units owned by a producer, in order to properly schedule\nproduction within the technical limits of each power plant and considering specific costs\n\nof each particular running decision;\n\n\u2022 Day-ahead pool prices\u2019 forecast for the considered period;\n\n\u2022 Purchase and sale prices forecast for bilateral contracts;\n\n\u2022 Forecasted data for hydro and wind power generation units comprised of hourly water\ninflows in hydro reservoirs and the hourly wind production, respectively, in order to\n\nbetter estimate an eventual production and its selling settlement.\n\nThe considered energy market\u2019s framework is comprised of two general platforms where\n\nGenCos can participate and try to achieve the best profit possible by trading their produced\n\nenergy. Specifically, producers are free to sell their production output in the pool and/or\n\nthrough bilateral agreements with retailers and large consumers. As a matter of fact, a pro-\n\nducer can even buy electrical energy bilaterally and, by doing so, take advantage of an eventual\n\nrise in pool prices, by trying to resell the energy bought bilaterally in the pool, with potential\n\nnet financial gain.\n\nIn real energy markets, GenCos may need to buy energy to competitors \u2014 whether in a\n\npool or through bilateral contracts \u2014 in order to cap its risk exposure to external unexpected\n\nevents, or even to guarantee the supply of a percentage of contractual obligations arising from\n\nlong-term contracts. Despite the adherence to reality of such scenarios, neither long-term\n\n33\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 3.1: Input and output data of the considered scheduling models\n\ncontracts nor risk management are considered in the following models.\n\nThe output data made available by the models is transversal to all of them. Hence, by\n\ncomputing the scheduling of a portfolio, GenCos will have at their disposal the best scenarios\n\nfor production settlement, meaning the proposed energy volume to be sold in the pool and\n\nthe second and third lots of energy that are proposed to be sold and bought through bilateral\n\ncontracts. A commitment status of each individual unit is also determined as well as their\n\nhourly production output (see Figure 3.1).\n\nDepending on the chosen scheduling model, more technical specification details may, or\n\nmay not, be used to optimise more accurately the production and its settlement towards the\n\nbest profit. Hereupon, further details on individual approaches to the described problem will\n\nbe discussed below.\n\n3.1 Thermal Portfolio Model\n\nAlthough clean electricity production technologies have been the recent focus of the great\n\nmajority of countries, thermal generation units still play an important role in the electric-\n\nity sector. Particularly, coal-fired \u2014 but also gas- and oil-fired \u2014 power plants have always\n\nbeen considered base-load units, due to their higher operational inertia, which did not allow\n\nbig generation fluctuations, due to high start-up and shut-down costs, slow output power\n\nrampages, considerably high minimum production levels and high fixed costs. However, de-\n\nspite the so called \u201cgreen policies\u201d, it is common thinking that fossil fuels, and thus thermal\n\npower plants, still have a crucial importance to play in the medium-and long-term future, as\n\nbalancing agents of the electric system, and as the market continues to be flooded with vari-\n\n34\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nable renewable production. Hence, further technological research has to continue to provide\n\nthis generation systems with higher flexibility and, naturally, lower costs, when operating as\n\nbackup units.\n\nThe following model suggests one way of determining an optimised market settlement\n\nof electrical energy, for a generation company, on both bilateral and pool markets, towards\n\nthe best possible revenue, from a given production portfolio composed by a set of thermal\n\nfossil-fuelled power plants. Such method is based on the deterministic approach formulated\n\nby Conejo et al. [58].\n\nBased on an input of forecasted market prices \u2014 for both pool and bilateral markets \u2014\n\nand on technical specifications of each generation unit, the model computes the best produc-\n\ntion scheduling for a given portfolio, including the best commitment for each unit and its\n\nhourly electricity production output. Additionally, an optimisation for market settlement is\n\ncomputed, providing the GenCo with the best bidding scenario towards a maximised profit.\n\nThe objective function (3.1) reflects the sum of the revenues for a given period of time, minus\n\nthe sum of all costs for the same period:\n\nz =\nNTX\n\nt=1\n\nNUTX\n\ni=1\n\n?Poolt ? VPoolt,i +\nNTX\n\nt=1\n\nV SaleBilateralt ? ?\nSale\nBilateralt\n\n?\n\nNTX\n\nt=1\n\nV PurchaseBilateralt ? ?\nPurchase\nBilateralt\n\n?\nNTX\n\nt=1\n\nNUTX\n\ni=1\n\n?Pi ? Pt,i\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe profit optimisation function is obtained by summing the revenues arising from both\n\nselling a variable quantity (VPool) of electricity in the pool and selling a variable volume\n\nV SaleBilateral via bilateral contracts. Additionally, all costs derived from electricity production\n\n(?P ) and eventual bilateral acquisitions (V PurchaseBilateral ) must be deducted. Constraints (3.2) to\n\n(3.8) ensure several technical limits as well as the logic dimension of all variables, and conse-\n\nquently the proper operation of the model and consistency of its output results.\n\nNUTX\n\ni=1\n\nVPoolt,i + V\nSale\nBilateralt\n\n? V PurchaseBilateralt =\nNUTX\n\ni=1\n\nPt,i, 8t (3.2)\n\nPt,i ? PMaxi, 8t, 8i (3.3)\n\nPt,i ?

Constraints (3.5)\n\nand (3.6) define volume limits for the energy produced by unit i during hour t sold in the\n\npool market. Volumes of energy bought and sold through bilateral contracts are delimited by\n\nequations (3.7) and (3.8). Therefore, V SaleBilateral and V\nPurchase\nBilateral must be, individually, less than\n\nor equal to overall name-plated power owned by the GenCo. This imposed limit aims a better\n\ndistribution of the power settlement on both bilateral and pool markets.\n\nContrary to pool prices, sale and purchase prices for bilaterally agreed contracts do not\n\nvary on an hourly basis, but according to settled contract periods. Likewise, contracted vol-\n\numes assume the same value along this tari?, meaning that contracted power volumes should\n\nbe respected by both buyers and sellers until the the contracted period is expired \u2014 a time\n\nwhen the two parties can negotiate and enrol in newly-agreed volumes for the next tari? pe-\n\nriod span.\n\nThe model also considers a mechanism to replicate the high volatility and low liquidity\n\nthat characterises bilateral markets [58]. The accumulation of purchase or sale energy blocks\n\nis then discouraged by gradually less favourable prices. As the producer accumulates buying\n\nor selling blocks, his profit margin decays due to the decrease of the profitability of both selling\n\nand buying blocks.\n\n3.2 Thermal and Wind Portfolio Model\n\nCoordination between electricity generation technologies is more and more a key issue to\n\nsecure a reliable electrical grid. Massive wind power production, that has become a reality\n\nworldwide, still lacks some reliability, and thus thermal power plants need to assist the system\n\nwith backup services, balancing the grid whenever necessary. Costs of this cooperation must\n\nbe taken into consideration since the greater share of thermal power capacity is still quite re-\n\n36\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nsilient to variability, having been built to provide a continuous and stable output production.\n\nHence, when used to operate under a di?erent generation regime, a careful management of\n\nhis portfolio should be done by every generation company in order to safeguard eventual risks\n\nand financial losses arising from a deficient planning and/or operation of an infrastructure.\n\nThe following model suggests a scheduling optimisation method in order to maximise prof-\n\nits of portfolios comprised of thermal and wind generation technologies. Similarly to Section\n\n3.1 and to the next Section 3.3, this section considers a deterministic scheduling settlement-\n\noriented model, which aims to provide the best bidding solution in both bilateral and pool\n\nmarkets, and at the same time, adjusting production scheduling. Furthermore, this computa-\n\ncional design is based on the Combined Unit Commitment and Emission (CUCE) problem [59].\n\nBy considering such a hybrid portfolio, this model can be an invaluable tool, since it\n\npermits to schedule the production of each producing unit, individually, while minimising\n\nthe greenhouse gases (GHG) emission and, therefore, avoiding to the maximum the inherent\n\ntaxes paid as a compensation for the release of those gases. Additionally, as it considers GHG\n\nemission costs, this model can be seen as a key-tool to access the competitiveness of thermal\n\npower plants equipped with carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems, which at the cost of\n\nincreasing generation costs, reduce massively CO2 emissions.\n\nz =\nNTX\n\nt=1\n\n\"\nNUTX\n\ni=1\n\n?Poolt ?

Hence, besides the obvious marginal cost of each energy unit \u2014 almost exclusively\n\nderived from fuel consumption \u2014 this method is comprised of a fixed value paid for each\n\nonline generation unit, independently of its current production.\n\n37\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nApart from that, considering only thermal units, the model also takes into account start-\n\nup and shut-down costs, as well as GHG emissions taxes. This factor is obviously restricted\n\nto thermal infrastructures, since wind turbines do not make any contribution for emissions\n\nduring its operation. GHG emissions are intrinsically related to the fuel used to fire each unit.\n\nHence, the release of pollutants depends on the unit e?ciency and whether the fuel used is\n\ncoal, natural gas or even oil, and it is consequently characterised by Fuel Consumption Coe?-\n\ncients (di, ei) and Fuel Emission Factors (efco2, efno2). For the present work, only CO2 and\n\nNO2 emissions are considered for taxation purposes, and its production factors are present in\n\nTable C.4.\n\nRegarding the objective function (3.9), C\np\nt,i represents the production costs from thermal\n\nunit i due to fuel consumption, Cet,i represents the production costs from thermal unit i due\n\nto GHG emissions, and C\nsu|sd\nt,i represents the production costs from thermal unit i due to\n\nstart-up and shut-down operations.

In fact, generation from hydro sources is usually highly controllable, especially\n\nin power plants equipped with water reservoirs, which allow big water retention and/or dis-\n\ncharges. The considerable dispatchability of hydro power \u2014 due to high production rampages\n\n\u2014 and the possibility of using pumping systems to lift and storage water from down to up-\n\nstream makes this technology the most adequate to minimise the e?ects of variable renewable\n\nproduction, for instance PV or wind power. The generation output of hydro power plants can\n\nbe modelled based on technical and operational specificities of the plants, such as the head of\n\nreservoir, water discharges or the natural inflow of water into the plants\u2019 basin.\n\nThe objective function (3.23), particularly designed for a portfolio comprised of hydro and\n\nwind generation technologies, addresses the optimisation method through the maximisation\n\nof the company\u2019s profit, by computing the di?erence between revenues from selling energy\n\nand the costs inherent to its production.\n\nz =\nNTX\n\nt=1\n\n(\nNUHX\n\nk=1\n\n?Poolt ?

This model also takes into account\n\nan eventual spatial coupling among reservoirs located in the same river basin (Figure 3.2).\n\nTherefore, it allows a generation scheduling optimisation of standalone hydro units as well as\n\nof units connected in series along the riverbed, having in consideration a time delay factor\n\n(?), stating the delay of the e?ects of an hydro power plants\u2019s water discharge on downstream\n\ninfrastructures.\n\nNUHX\n\nk=1\n\nVPoolt,k +\nNUWX\n\nu=1\n\nVPoolt,u + V\nSale\nBilateralt\n\n=\nNUHX\n\nk=1\n\nPt,k +\nNUWX\n\nu=1\n\nPt,u ?

In other words, the constraint states equality between the trans-\n\nacted energy net volumes and the generated electrical energy required to supply such needs.\n\nAs mentioned before, the method followed by [63] uses a set of curves to bind water discharges\n\nand power outputs.\n\nAs it can be seen in Figure 3.3, each three-dimensional curve relates power output, water\n\ndischarge and the head of the reservoir. Constraint (3.25) assure the correct hourly perfor-\n\nmance curve assignment considering the existing water volume vt,k in each reservoir k at t.\n\n41\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 3.3: Performance curves for plant i and discretisation of curve 1 (Power vs Water Discharge) [63]\n\nvt,k ?

If vt,k is located between the low level and the upper level V Uk (XUi in Figure\n\n3.3), then Curve 2 is selected. On the other hand, if the reservoir content is above the upper\n\nlevel limit, Curve 3 is selected and unit k operates according to the higher performance curve.\n\nBinary values, d1t,k and d2t,k, operate as a switch, used to select the right curve:\n\n8\n>>><\n\n>>>:\n\nPerformance Curve 1 if d1t,k = 0 ^ d2t,k = 0;\n\nPerformance Curve 2 if d1t,k = 1 ^ d2t,k = 0;\n\nPerformance Curve 3 if d1t,k = 1 ^ d2t,k = 1;\n\nFormulation of the non-concave unit performance curves is made as shown by constraints\n\n(3.26) to (3.31). Constraint (3.26) represents the construction of Curve 1, designed for op-\n\nerations with low level reservoir contents. Since low water contents presupposes d1t,k = 0\n\nand d2t,k = 0, the output power is, then, equal to the minimum power plus the blocks of the\n\nlower-level piecewise linear curve. This situation is analogous to (3.27), for Curve 2, and to\n\n(3.28), for Curve 3.\n\n42\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nPt,k ? P01k ?

Its characteristics are mostly derived from the multi-agent platform JADE, aiming to\n\nshow and carefully study all the interactions and events taking place in a real-world electric-\n\nity market situation. This tool was designed to provide simulation capacities to mimic, for\n\ninstance, the real environment of an electricity pool market. Additionally, due to JADE\u2019s\n\nplatform, interaction among several market players can be modelled and simulated.\n\nThe current version of the simulator allows the recreation of an electricity pool platform\n\nboth in the daily and intra-daily markets, based on two main market models, namely the\n\nsystem marginal price (SMP) and the locational marginal price (LMP). These models allow a\n\ncomplete analysis of both the day-ahead market and the adjustment market, essential to the\n\nproper functioning of the electricity sector. To perform the simulations and extract the conse-\n\nquent results, a sequence of processes needs to be followed with the purpose of configuring the\n\nagents, the market model under appreciation, the pricing algorithm and some characteristics\n\nof the power grid.\n\nThe main window of the MAN-REM (Figure 4.1) was designed to provide an essential\n\noverview of the market agents, which are about to interact in a virtual market. Along side\n\nthe left and right borders, the name of each market player is added and also detailed personal\n\ninformation is sequentially introduced by the user.\n\n45\n\n\n\nF\nig\nu\nre\n\n4\n.1\n:\nM\nA\nN\n-R\n\nE\nM\n\nsi\nm\nu\nla\nto\nr:\n\nh\no\nm\ne\nsc\nre\nen\n\n46\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n4.1.1 Participants: Agents Menu\n\nCurrently, the software is comprised of three categories of agents, which can interact with\n\none another, notably Generation Companies, Retail Companies and End-Use Costumers. As\n\na first step during the creation of a new agent (Figure 4.2), whether a generation company\n\n(GenCo agent), a retailer or a consumer, one is invited to provide some generic informations\n\nabout it. In the case of adding a GenCo \u2014 in the\u201cEnter GenCo\u201dwindow (Figure 4.3) \u2014 apart\n\nfrom the GenCo Name, all input details are indicative. This process formalises the creation\n\nof a new production agent that could be subsequently called to interact in a market simulation.\n\n4.1.2 Market Models: Markets Menu\n\nThe \u201cMarkets Menu\u201d allows the user to select the market model which will rule the desired\n\nsimulation. This menu provides options for the energy market on the stock exchange and\n\nthe bilateral trading, such as the Energy Markets, Forward Market or Futures Market. Con-\n\ncerning the Energy Markets, either the Day-ahead Market or the Intraday Market can be\n\nsimulated using two di?erent bidding algorithms.\n\nSystem marginal price (SMP)\n\nThe system marginal price algorithm, developed by team of the MAN-REM project, and\n\nadded to the system, allows market simulation stock. The structure of the o?ers, as men-\n\ntioned, comprises the hourly time of each o?er, the purchase/sale price and the volume of\n\nenergy to trade (Figure 4.4). Unlike the local marginal price algorithm, presented below, the\n\nSMP does not include network specifications, meaning that it does not have the ability to\n\ncheck for bottlenecks. The SMP forms the basis of the algorithms used by some real-world\n\nmarkets, including MIBEL, to define the prices of the daily and intraday markets.\n\nLocational marginal price (LMP)\n\nThe locational marginal price algorithm allows market simulation on the stock exchange, and\n\ncan assign a price per hour to every single power grid node. Its structure, as mentioned,\n\nincludes a greater number of data, compared with the single marginal price algorithm, pre-\n\nsenting di?erences regarding the structure of the o?ers, composed of an initial price and a\n\nslope variable, representing the elasticity of the agent to the market price, positively influenc-\n\ning the increased bid sale price. For a more detailed description of the system, the interested\n\nreader is referred to [10, 12, 65].\n\n47\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.2: Window to create a new agent\n\nFigure 4.3: Add a new production agent: GenCo personal info window\n\nFigure 4.4: Pricing mechanisms window\n\n48\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n4.2 The Extended MAN-REM Simulator\n\nIn order to provide a self-scheduling tool, several new crucial interface windows were added\n\nto the existing software, representing a significant share of the work time invested in this\n\nproject, which was reflected in more than 12 000 programming JAVA code lines, developed\n\non NetBeans IDE.\n\nSince all generation units were, in their former version, characterised simply by their max-\n\nimum and minimum output power, and due to some complexity of the input data required\n\nby the self-scheduling models presented in the previous chapter, a new and larger virtual\n\ndatabase for technical specifications was created, in order to store all the necessary details.\n\nAdditionally, a new set of interface windows was added to the simulator, allowing one\n\nto declare all the required information regarding an agent\u2019s portfolio. Moreover, new upload\n\nfunctionalities were added to MAN-REM to provide information on production forecasts con-\n\ncerning wind farms or even on hourly water inflows in reservoirs associated to hydro power\n\nplants. The scheduling process added to the software will be explained in detail further on.\n\n4.2.1 Portfolio Construction\n\nAfter the creation of a new GenCo agent, the following step is its allocation to a portfolio of\n\npower plants. The \u201cAdd Portfolio\u201d window, shown in Figure 4.5, is the starting point for the\n\nportfolio construction. As can be seen, the user can sequentially add new generation units,\n\nproceed to further update existing power plants, or even remove some of them. Summarised\n\ndata about the current portfolio is made available through the data table of the window.\n\nPressing the \u201cAdd\u201d button of the \u201cAdd Portfolio\u201d window initiates the process of adding a\n\nnew generation unit, showing the \u201cPreliminary Information\u201d window (Figure 4.6). As shown,\n\nthe type of this window allows the user to provide general technical specifications, transversal\n\nto all technologies, such as Technology, Fuel, Minimum Power and Maximum Power. An unit\n\nID can also be provided for the propose of identification.\n\n49\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.5: Add a new production agent: add portfolio window\n\nFigure 4.6: Adding a new production agent: preliminary information windows\n50\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.7: Adding a new production agent: add new thermal/hydro unit to GenCo windows\n\n51\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.8: Adding a new production agent: add new wind unit to GenCo windows\n\n52\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.9: Scheduling a GenCo\u2019s portfolio: add portfolio window (final)\n\nThree main production technologies were considered: thermal, hydro and wind. However,\n\nfuel distinctions are accounted when it comes to thermal technologies, permitting to specify\n\nthe firing type of each power plant. For the wind case, an existing database of wind turbines is\n\navailable and the user can simply select the desired model. Additionally, the user is required\n\nto provide the number of wind generators that are part of the wind farm.\n\nFrom here, the process of adding of new generation units su?ers a ramification according\n\nto the selected technology. Therefore, if Thermal Unit is selected in the \u201cTechnology\u201d box,\n\nthe user is further invited to proceed to the \u201cThermal Unit Information\u201d window and fill the\n\nremaining thermal-related technical details. Likewise, if the Hydro Unit option is selected,\n\nthe user is redirected to the \u201cHydro Unit Information\u201d window or, in the case of the Wind\n\nUnit, to the \u201cWind Turbine Technical Details\u201d window, where technical specifications of the\n\nturbines are displayed. In particular, the \u201cWind Speed Regime\u201d window, where hourly wind\n\nspeeds are defined to further compute wind farm\u2019s output production, and the \u201cWind Unit\n\nCost Information\u201d window, where eventual fixed and variable production costs (see Figure\n\n4.8).\n\nDuring the construction process of a GenCo\u2019s portfolio, the user has the chance to overview\n\nthe composition of the current generation infrastructure. Once this process is completed, the\n\ndata inserted can be saved by clicking\u201cSave\u201din the\u201cAdd Portfolio\u201dwindow (Figure 4.9), lead-\n\ning the user to the window where forecasts of prices of pool and bilateral contracts markets\n\nare submitted to the system (Figure 4.10), before finishing the first stage towards a further\n\nmarket simulation.\n\n53\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.10: Adding a new production agent: set GenCo\u2019s price forecasts window\n\n4.2.2 Scheduling Process\n\nThe second stage of market simulation, as adherent as possible to the reality, is the GenCo\u2019s\n\nself-scheduling of production and the subsequent electricity market settlement. Despite the\n\nfact that both objectives and methods of a self-scheduling process may vary from company\n\nto company, all the considered models integrated in MAN-REM, as discussed in Subsections\n\n3.1, 3.3 and 3.2, address this problem by optimising the financial profit from selling energy in\n\nthe market, through the maximisation of the net balance of revenues and costs. Accordingly,\n\na \u201cUnit Selection\u201d window was created, so that users can specify the scheduling optimisation\n\nprocess details (Figure 4.11).\n\nAfter choosing the desired generation agent for the scheduling optimisation, the user will\n\nhave at his/her disposal a list of the electricity generation units associated to it. As discussed\n\nin Chapter 3, each optimisation method has the focus on a particular portfolio composition\n\nand, therefore, scheduling models should be chosen with regard to the selected portfolio.\n\n54\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.11: Scheduling a GenCo\u2019s portfolio: choosing model window\n\nHence, even if a given GenCo owns three di?erent generation technologies, if the \u201cThermal\n\nportfolio\u201d model is selected, the simulator immediately runs a filter, removing all other tech-\n\nnologies from the table, disabling its usage. This \u201cfiltering\u201d mechanism works in the same\n\nmanner for the remaining models, in order to display only plausible unit options, according\n\nto the selected model.\n\nThe \u201cSelect/Unselect\u201d button was designed to add units to the optimisation process. This\n\nstep allows the user to pick, among the available portfolio, the generation units that are to be\n\nscheduled and those which, by any reason, are not.\n\nDepending on the selected scheduling model, more input details may be necessary for the\n\noptimisation to be successful. For instance, if the \u201cHydro and Wind Portfolio\u201d model is se-\n\nlected, the \u201cHydro Cascade\u201d panel is enabled and the user has the possibility to configure a\n\nsequential spacial coupling among the selected group of hydro units. In this case, a time delay,\n\nforeseen by the \u201cHydro and Wind Portfolio\u201d model, is required, defining the time needed for\n\nthe downstream reservoir to be a?ected by the operation of the upstream hydro unit.\n\nSimilarly, data for the \u201cThermal and Wind Portfolio\u201d model concerning the taxation over\n\ngreenhouse emissions (CO2 and NO2) should be inserted, if this model is selected, and then\n\nthe \u201cEmissions\u201d panel is enabled.\n\n55\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.12: Scheduling a GenCo\u2019s portfolio: set pre-sold energy volumes window\n\nThe \u201cContractual Allocation of Wind Power\u201d window (Figure 4.12) was especially created\n\nto support the insertion of a new type of input required by the new \u201cThermal, Hydro and\n\nWind Portfolio\u201d scheduling model. In this case, the user has the option to set an hourly share\n\nof the wind farms\u2019 total capacity that is already sold through bilateral contracts even before\n\nthe start of the day-ahead market session. Additionally, since the electricity volume sold a\n\npriori can or cannot be e?ectively produced due to the variability of the wind resource, it is\n\nessencial to define a penalty, charged for each energy unit not delivered.\n\nOnce the\u201cGenerate Scheduling\u201doption is selected, the model can run and the optimisation\n\nfunction computed by LP SOLVE 5.5, a freeware Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)\n\nsolver, developed at the Eindhoven University of Technology, which solves pure linear, (mixed)\n\ninteger/binary, semi-continuous and special ordered sets models [66, 67]. In other words, all\n\nthe models described in the previous chapter were implemented in the MAN-REM system,\n\nusing the JAVA programming language, and LP SOLVE 5.5.\n\n56\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.13: Scheduling a GenCo\u2019s portfolio: place pool bids windows\n\n4.2.3 Scheduling Results Data\n\nOutput data is summarised on the \u201cScheduling Output\u201d window. As depicted in Figure 4.14,\n\nfour charts provide all the output information computed by the selected scheduling model.\n\nHere, after checking the suggested hourly energy settlement, scheduled production and fore-\n\ncasted profit and comparing both prices and costs1, the user has the possibility to agree with\n\nthe presented solution and Save the scheduling data or, on the other hand, reject (Discard)\n\nit and restart the scheduling process with further desired changes in the portfolio.\n\nAgreeing on the scheduling optimisation output means that all bids are sent to the market\n\noperator. Depending on the number (n) of generation units scheduled, a GenCo places n bids\n\ninto the pool market. Each bid, placed separately for each unit, is embodied by an energy\n\nvolume and a price, which is equal to the respective marginal cost inherent to its generation\n\nunit (Figure 4.13).\n\nOnce the self-scheduling process is finished, more generation competitors can join the mar-\n\nket and have their portfolios scheduled, increasing the pool competitiveness.\n\n1The reason why the marginal costs of the unit \u201cTermica 2\u201d are not visible in the \u201cPrices &amp; Costs\u201d window\ntab is the overlapping with the line of \u201cTermica 2\u201d whose marginal costs have the same value.\n\n57\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.14: Scheduling a GenCo\u2019s portfolio: scheduling output window\n\n4.2.4 Additional Developments\n\nApart from the main developments indicated above, other features were also deployed and\n\nimplemented in this new version of the MAN-REM simulator:\n\nLoad \u201cGeneration Agent and Portfolio\u201d\n\nDue to some complexity and lengthy of the process required to add a new generation agent\n\nand its portfolio from scratch, a load function was created so that users could gradually cre-\n\nate a market environment scenario much more expeditiously. Consequently, this new software\n\nversion has available a Genco Template, under the form of an EXCEL spreadsheet, that can\n\nbe used as a database to be uploaded and, instantly, construct a new generation agent.\n\n58\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 4.15: Over-the-counter contracts clearing tool\n\n59\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nElectronic Bilateral Trading Mechanism\n\nDespite the fact that MAN-REM already has an agent-based mechanism of trading for the\n\nbilateral contracts market, such tool is a negotiation-based trading platform, which involves\n\nnegotiation between agents \u2014 buyers and sellers \u2014 according to their goals and adopted\n\nstrategies.\n\nThe \u201cElectronic Trading Mechanism\u201d, as discussed in Subsubsection 2.3.2, is an entry-\n\norder merit system where, once an order is received, the software runs the exchange, checking\n\nand looking up for a matching o?er. As such solution did not exist in the previous software\n\nversion, a contract clearing platform was developed and added to the MAN-REM in order\n\nto provide a new market tool. Figure 4.15 depicts this trading platform which arranges all\n\nplaced o?ers according to their entry order. Once the clearing procedure is started, the sys-\n\ntem initiates a loop-based method and compares the first o?er, at the top, with the following\n\no?ers. If a match is found, both o?ers are cleared at the sale price. Moreover, if one of the\n\nmatched o?ers is not completely fulfilled in its power volume, the remaining power is kept in\n\nthe market for a further match until it is totally cleared.\n\n60\n\n\n\nProduction Scheduling: Case Studies\n\nThe following case studies aim to demonstrate at some level the relevance of the self-scheduling\n\nmodels added to the simulator and the MAN-REM\u2019s output data. Simultaneously, this demon-\n\nstration process will also allow to evaluate the correct functioning and pertinence of all the\n\nfifteen new windows that were programmed and embodied in the simulator along this work.\n\nHence, this chapter will be essentially a bipartite exercise where the responsivity of the models\n\nto the GenCo\u2019s target market prices will be assessed (Case Study I) and the e?ect of variable\n\nrenewable electricity production on pool prices will be demonstrated (Case Study II).\n\nFor the first case study, two simulations of the day-ahead electricity pool market were\n\nrun for each scheduling model to be tested, totalling six market simulations (3 models ? 2\nsimulations). Hereupon, a set of generation agents, holding di?erent unit portfolios, and of\n\nretail agents, were used in order to mimic a competitive power market. Furthermore, a single\n\nsale bid, comprised of twenty-four prices and volumes, was sent by an additional generation\n\nagent. After all the sale and purchase bids were communicated to the market operator, the\n\npool mechanism was run and the market cleared, yielding the transacted volumes and the\n\nmarket clearing prices. Aiming to test the coherence of each model, the single bid referred\n\nabove is replaced by another one, calculated using the self-scheduling optimisation and having\n\nthe MCP from the previous session as price target. Both output values were then compared.\n\nThe second case study aims at analysing the e?ect of high variable production from re-\n\nnewables \u2014 wind, in this particular case \u2014 on pool prices, and requires only two market\n\nsimulations, where using the same set of market agents as in the prior simulations, the wind\n\nspeeds forecasted and provided as an input to the model are substantially antagonistic, rep-\n\nresenting each of them a windy day and a low-wind day. For both wind speed scenarios, the\n\nmarket is run and the yielded MCP compared.\n\n61\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n5.1 Case Study I: Demonstration of the Optimisation Models\n\nIn order to demonstrate the functioning of the self-scheduling optimisation models, added to\n\nthe MAN-REM extended version as a result of this work, and analyse their output data, the\n\nsystem will be subject to some testing examination.\n\nBecause this process requires consecutive pool market simulations, a standard set of market\n\nplayers was defined, meaning that certain producers and retailers are kept constant through-\n\nout this case study. Consequently, eleven bids from three di?erent generation companies \u2014\n\nP2, P3 and P4 \u2014 represent a static group of sale o?erings to the market, which are submitted\n\nto the MAN-REM\u2019s virtual market operator and ensure enough market liquidity.\n\nAs depicted in Figure 5.1, an additional sale agent \u2014 P0{T,T&amp;W,H&amp;W} \u2014 was included\n\nin the market and whose portfolio is dependent on the optimisation model being analysed \u2014\n\n\u201cThermal Portfolio\u201d, \u201cThermal and Wind Portfolio\u201d and \u201cHydro and Wind Portfolio\u201d, respec-\n\ntively. Each o?ering consists of a certain energy volume and marginal cost associated with the\n\ngeneration unit where it is produced. For the present exercise, it was decided that GenCos\n\nwould bid their nameplate capacity over the twenty-four hours period which constitutes the\n\nday-ahead pool market span (Figure 5.2). The P0{T,T&amp;W,H&amp;W} producers\u2019 bids are defined\n\n\u201cmanually\u201d, without the intervention of any system to support the management of production\n\nand operation of the generation portfolio.\n\nLikewise, eleven standard purchase o?erings from retail companies \u2014 Best Energy, SCO\n\nCorporation, Electro Center and First Energy \u2014 were considered, providing considerable com-\n\npetition to the market. Contrary to the generation companies\u2019 bids, purchase o?erings, based\n\non [68] are variable in volume and price throughout the day (Figure 5.3), picturing consump-\n\ntion profiles from a wide range of industrial, domestic and commercial electricity consumers\n\n(further details are shown in Tables B.1 \u2013 B.4).\n\nFigure 5.1: Scheme of market agents entering the market (first market simulation)\n\n62\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 5.2: Producers\u2019 sets of o?erings to the day-ahead pool market\n\nFigure 5.3: Retailers\u2019 purchase bids to the market (power and price)\n\n63\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 5.4: Retailers\u2019 power bids shares on the market\n\nFigure 5.4 shows how the considered hypothetical demand is shared among retail com-\n\npanies. Firstly, for each model, a first day-ahead pool market simulation was run with the\n\nstandard players and the respective producer P0n. This demand-supply matching process of\n\nelectricity volumes, which characterises the pool market clearing operation, occurs as men-\n\ntioned previously in Section 2.3, yielding twenty-four hourly transacted energy volumes and\n\nmarket marginal prices, determining which purchase and sale bids were accepted and those\n\nwhich were not.\n\nThen, a profit optimisation session was simulated using the market marginal prices values\n\nas GenCo\u2019s \u2014 P1{T,T&amp;W,H&amp;W} \u2014 market prices forecasts (Equation 5.1). Therefore, in this\n\ncase the variable agent\u2019s bid was not manually submitted to the market operator but computed\n\nby the self-scheduling model under analysis, optimising the commitment and production of\n\nits portfolio according to an input of prices forecasts.\n\n?Poolt = V1,t, 8t = {1, 2, ..., 24}. (5.1)\n\nThis testing method is based on comparing both produced energy volumes and clearing-\n\nmarket prices from the first pool market simulation and the output of the considered opti-\n\nmisation models that will define the o?erings to market in the second market session. By\n\ncomparing the first market clearance and the further self-scheduling data, based on the mar-\n\nket prices given by the MMP from the first iteration, this exercise allows to see whether the\n\nbehaviour of the models demonstrates the desired sensitivity to prices forecasts in order to\n\nproperly schedule the commitment and output of a GenCo\u2019s generation units portfolio. In case\n\nthe transacted volumes during the first market simulation are similar to the ones yielded from\n\n64\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nthe model, the conclusion that an important part of the optimisation algorithm is working\n\nproperly can be drawn. Table 5.1, Table 5.2 and Table 5.3 show data from the three di?erent\n\nvalidation exercises.\n\nFor each model (and Table), it can be seen that the volumes \u201cin merit\u201d from the first\n\nmarket session of the Pn producers are coincident with those from the self-scheduling optimi-\n\nsation which had the MMP from the first session as forecast input. Accordingly, one can say\n\nthat, by using a self-scheduling optimisation model, a generation company would be able to\n\nestimate better its most probable minimum revenue, and to prepare its actions according to\n\nthe circumstances. By foreseeing the failure of some units to be \u201cin merit\u201d, the producer can\n\nthen be aware of the low probability of having to start them in order to supply the market and\n\nfulfil the demand. Additionally, as expected, hourly market marginal prices were a (perfect)\n\nmatch when comparing both market sessions.\n\nDespite coherence of output data, some discrepancies can be easily spotted on Table 5.1,\n\nregarding the testing of the \u201cThermal Portfolio\u201d\u201cHydro and Wind Portfolio\u201d and model (see\n\nalso Figure 5.5). Due to the fact that the agent\u2019s producing unit was the last \u201cin merit\u201d unit\n\nto be accepted by the market operator, and thus is the marginal unit, only part of the sale bid\n\nwas e?ectively transacted via-pool. This event is patent at 01:00h, first, and then at 05:00h\n\nand 06:00h. The major motive for this to happen is the input data necessary for the model to\n\noptimise generation: because this is a profit-driven optimisation, a given GenCo\u2019s generation\n\nis defined on price forecasts and not on demand forecasts, making the model insensitive to\n\nthe demand-side necessity (or not) of certain volumes of electricity.

Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n5.2 Case Study II: E?ect of High Levels of Renewable Variable\n\nGeneration on Pool Market Prices\n\nAiming to illustrate the functionalities of the MAN-REM through the demonstration of the\n\ne?ect of di?erent non-dispatchable electricity generation levels on pool market marginal prices,\n\ntwo day-ahead pool market sessions were simulated. This matter assumes capital importance\n\nat a time when clean energy generation systems, such as wind and photovoltaics, are under\n\nprofound deployment worldwide.\n\nRegarding the retail market players, a set of bids comprised of prices and energy volumes,\n\nsimilar to the one considered in Section 5.1 for the first case study (Figure 5.3), was used\n\n(Tables B.1 \u2013 B.4). On the other hand, several production units operating according various\n\ngeneration technologies were allocated to the four GenCos, who played an active role in this\n\nmarket simulation: GenCo 1, GenCo 2, GenCo 3 and GenCo 4 (Table 5.4).\n\nTwo market simulations were carried out in order to illustrate the influence of a scenario\n\ncharacterised by high wind speed against a scenario of low wind speed, namely by compar-\n\ning their hourly marginal prices. Hence, the main di?erence between the two simulations\n\nis precisely the input data (to the self-scheduling optimisation models) related to the wind\n\nspeed forecasts, which will allow the producer to estimate the hourly wind production for the\n\nnext twenty-four hours and hence its whole portfolio commitment. Table C.1 shows in detail\n\nthe hourly wind speed forecasts used in this case for both the low and high speed scenarios.\n\nLikewise, Table C.2 shows the actual output wind power generation from the considered wind\n\nfarms computed, for each case, according to the technical characteristics of the installed wind\n\nturbines\u2019 models (see Table A.1).\n\nAs mentioned above, a set of generation companies owning, each of them, several genera-\n\ntion units, was considered. Tables C.3 \u2013 C.9 describe the technical specificities of each of these\n\nplants. Figure 5.6 shows the composition of the group of electricity producers that constitutes\n\nthe electricity generation system considered, according to the generation technology of their\n\npower plants. Consequently, an overall generation capacity of 2 831, 65 MW constitutes the\n\nelectrical system here simulated, having considerable contributions from hydro power, coal,\n\nan important share of wind power, and smaller power availability from natural gas and oil.\n\n69\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nGeneration\nThermal Hydro Wind\n\nCompany\n\nGenCo 1\n\nThermal 1\n\n- -Thermal 2\n\nThermal 3\n\nGenCo 2 -\nHydro 2 W1\n\nHydro 3 W2\n\nGenCo 3\n\nThermal 4\n\n-\n\nW3\n\nW4\n\nThermal 5 W5\n\nGenCo 4 Thermal 6 Hydro 6\nW6\n\nW7\n\nTable 5.4: GenCos\u2019 portfolios composition\n\nFigure 5.6: Representativity of each generation technology composing the generation system\n\nThe generation costs considered for hydro [61, 62] and thermal power [58, 59] plants follow\n\nstate-of-art fixed and variable costs, whereas marginal costs of wind power were considered to\n\nbe in the interval referred in Section 2.4. Marginal costs of all the units that participate in\n\nthe market are shown in Table C.9. Despite other costs are shown in Table C.9, and because\n\nproducers are expected to bid in the market at marginal costs, this case study considered only\n\nthe costs on the last column (e/MWh).\n\nFigure 5.7 depicts the market marginal prices (see Table C.10 for further details) yielded\n\nfrom the two pool market simulations. A considerable decay of market marginal prices can be\n\neasily noticed when higher wind speeds are registered due to their influence on wind farms\u2019\n\noutput production and, consequently, to the flooding of the pool market with wind power at\n\nlower (if not null) marginal costs.\n\n70\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nAs already discussed in Section 2.4, wind power\u2019s low OPEX costs easily result in lower\n\nmarket marginal costs because of its e?ect on pushing more expensive generation units on-\n\nwards and, oftentimes, disposing them from the group of the in merit producers. For the\n\npresent exercise, an average market marginal price reduction of around 4,43e/MWh was reg-\n\nistered, having the price spreads oscillated from a minimum of 0,00 e/MWh \u2014 at 06:00h and\n\n21:00h \u2014 to a maximum of 17,65 e/MWh \u2014 registered at 00:00h.\n\nBy examining Figures 5.8 and 5.9 one can get to the conclusion that marginal prices fall\n\nis intrinsically linked to the avoidance of calling fuel-fired power plants to produce electricity\n\nthrough the use of electrical energy generated by wind farms. Specifically, during the night\n\nperiod, namely between 00:00h and 05:00h, the reduction of reliance on coal can clearly be\n\nnoticed when a high output wind production is registered during these hours of low load.\n\nBesides the market marginal price reduction, another e?ect of high shares of electricity\n\nproduction from wind farms on the market clearance was verified. In fact, the transacted\n\nvolume of energy through this pool platform increased when higher wind generation was reg-\n\nistered. Whereas in a low wind speed scenario (and thus low wind output production), the\n\noverall volume of negotiated energy was of about 17 083,23 MWh, under a high wind speed\n\nscenario, the daily amount of traded electricity via-pool rose from approximately 2 799,29\n\nMWh up to 19 882,52 MWh. This non-surprising event is justified by the increase of the\n\nsocial welfare and the increase of quantity demanders can pay for.\n\nFigure 5.7: Day-ahead pool market clearing prices\n\n71\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nFigure 5.8: Hourly power generation by technology under a low wind speed scenario\n\nFigure 5.9: Hourly power generation by technology under a high wind speed scenario\n\nIt should also be highlighted the fact that, in both market scenarios, neither hydro nor\n\noil generation technologies managed to be \u201cin merit\u201d in the simulated markets due to their\n\nhigher marginal costs when compared to the remaining sources of power production.\n\n72\n\n\n\nConclusions and Further Developments\n\nIn an era of great demographic expansion and relative levelling of living standards in some of\n\nthe more densely populated areas of the planet, the human kind is facing extreme challenges\n\nto provide to more than seven billion people the goods and services that, not so far from us,\n\nwere only part of a minority\u2019s life. Electricity, as almost any other utility, has seen its demand\n\nrocket over the last hundred years and even more with the industrial and economic explosion\n\nof countries, such as India, China, Russia and others emerging regions. Massive quantities of\n\ndemanded electrical energy have evidenced even more a chronicle problem of this sector: a\n\nprofound reliance on fossil fuels burning to fire power plants and its inherent greenhouse e?ect\n\ngases emissions with all the negative aspects of their spread into the atmosphere. Currently,\n\nsome previous policies regarding the sustainability of our society, including of the energy\n\nsector, are already yielding some changes on the electricity generation landscape, with the\n\nintroduction of considerable renewable and CO2-free production technologies, including wind,\n\nsolar and geothermal, as well as pumping and chemical storage systems, which promote wiser\n\nand more e?cient use of the electricity produced.\n\nThe current diversity of production technologies with distinct operation regimes, costs\n\nand maturities has provoked the rise of market competition up to levels never seen before,\n\nexposing particularly generation companies to higher financial and operational risks that need\n\nto be forearmed for the sake of an e?cient sector. Market simulators, particularly multi-agent\n\nsystems with higher adherence to the reality of market and negotiation environments, are\n\n(extraordinary) tools that allow the study of the interactions between agents from di?erent\n\nbackgrounds and with distinct expectations, as well as the consequences of the introduction\n\nof new types of agents, generation technologies, market regulations or any other aspects.\n\nHereupon, the aim of this work was to provide the already existent MAN-REM market\n\nsimulator with a set of tools that could be helpful to a producer to self-schedule its units\u2019\n\ncommitment and output production based on technical specificities of the generation portfo-\n\nlio, market prices and renewable production forecasts, in order to maximise its financial profit\n\nwithin a considered period span.\n\n73\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nAfter the conclusion of the simulator\u2019s expansion, three self-scheduling models had been\n\nadded to the software, each of them with special focus on a particular generation portfolio\u2019s\n\ntechnology composition. Hence, producers owning thermal units, thermal and wind units and\n\nhydro and wind units were considered and are now allowed to self-schedule their production\n\ntowards a profitable sale of the output electricity through both bilateral contracts and pool\n\nmarket. Interface windows to enable an easy and e?cient addition of agents and portfolios to\n\nthe market were also patched to the existent version of MAN-REM as well as an electronic\n\ntrading mechanism for bilateral transactions.\n\nThe case study adopted to demonstrate the optimisation algorithms has demonstrated\n\nthat a good coordination between the input prices forecasts and the output generation and\n\ncommitment of units exists. Units whose marginal prices are above the forecasted prices the\n\nproducers expect to sell their energy by, are immediately excluded from the generation plan-\n\nning in order to avoid financial losses.\n\nAlso, by developing a second case study, the software has allowed to demonstrate that\n\nrenewable generation units, with traditionally lower marginal costs, surpass more marginally\n\nexpensive production technologies such as thermal or hydro. This substitution of technologies\n\non the meritocratic hierarchy results on the displacement of coal- and gas-fired power plants\n\nwith beneficial consequences whether for the reduction of GHG emissions or for the lowering\n\nof pool market prices. In fact, weak demand periods, usually during the night, are some time\n\ncharacterised by substantial reductions of the market clearing prices, when sometimes the\n\nenergy is transacted freely or, depending on the region, at negative prices.\n\n6.1 Further Developments\n\nRegarding future work, and aiming to improve the MAN-REM multi-agent simulator and some\n\nof the added features, resulting from this dissertation, a few suggestions may be followed and\n\nused to make it a more robust and realistic tool. The following development paths are then\n\nproposed:\n\n\u2022 Proceed with further testings in order to prove the logical stability and coherence of the\nself-scheduling optimisation models added to the MAN-REM, assuring a correct unit\n\ncommitment status and output production;\n\n\u2022 Complement the self-scheduling optimisation tools, added as result of this work, with\nthe introduction of a certain level of uncertainty, which characterises a real market\n\n74\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\nsituation, for instance on the day-ahead market prices forecasts, and the uncertainty\n\narising from imperfect wind speed and hydro inflows forecasts. Risk assessment and\n\nmanagement tools should then be considered as the next step to turn market simulations\n\nmore realistic;\n\n\u2022 Development of new self-scheduling optimisation models focused on broader units port-\nfolio compositions, such as photovoltaic power, hydro storage and even chemical battery\n\nstorage facilities, providing the user with the chance to have more realistic simulations\n\nby adding, to his portfolio, technologies that are already widely used Worldwide;\n\n\u2022 Study, development and implementation of a more realistic market system where day-\nahead pool market clearance is operated simultaneously with bilateral negotiation and\n\nagreements in order to assure that a correct settlement of all energy volumes, bought\n\nand produced, is properly achieved.\n\n75\n\n\n\nElectricity Trading Through Both Pool and Bilateral Markets\n\n76\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] V.
