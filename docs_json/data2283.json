Adviser: Eduardo Seiti Gomide Mizubuti. \n\n \n\nSouth American leaf blight (SALB) is a destructive disease caused by the fungus \n\nPseudocercospora ulei that can severely affect rubber tree in monoculture in tropical \n\nAmerica. The causal agent of the disease is a hemibiotrophic pathogen, that grows \n\nslowly under in vitro conditions. Isolation of good quality DNA in proper quantities is \n\nnot an easy task due to the difficulties in the handling of P. ulei under laboratory \n\nconditions and the lack of a standard protocol. Although SALB has been known for \n\nnearly a century, information on the genetic structure of P. ulei in the Amazon region, \n\nits center of origin, remains unknown. In this work, adequate protocols for DNA \n\nextraction were assessed and the population genetic structure of P. ulei in the Amazon \n\nregion was determined using 12 microsatellite loci (SSR). Six extraction protocols were \n\ncompared regarding yield and purity of the DNA. A total of 61 isolates were sampled \n\nalong the Madeira, Purus and Juru\u00e1 watersheds located in the Amazon region and SSR \n\ngenotyped. The Doyle and Doyle DNA extraction protocol was the one that presented \n\nconsistent and better quality extracted DNA. There was linkage disequilibrium \n\nbetween alleles and genetic differentiation between geographically distant populations \n\nwas detected. Principal component analysis revealed clustering of the isolates \n\naccording to the watershed boundaries. Two groups were formed, one comprised by \n\nindividuals from the Madeira river and the other comprised of individuals from the \n\nPurus and Juru\u00e1 rivers. \n\nv \n\n\n\n \n \n\n  \n\nRESUMO \n\n \nSANTOS, Taciana Ferreira, M.Sc., Universidade Federal de Vi\u00e7osa, fevereiro de \n2018. Estrutura gen\u00e9tica da popula\u00e7\u00e3o de Pseudocercospora ulei nas bacias \nhidrogr\u00e1ficas do rio Amazonas. Orientador: Eduardo Seiti Gomide Mizubuti. \n\n \n\nO mal das folhas da seringueira (MDF) \u00e9 uma doen\u00e7a destrutiva causada pelo fungo \n\nPseudocercospora ulei que pode afetar severamente a seringueira em monocultura na \n\nAm\u00e9rica tropical. O agente causal da doen\u00e7a \u00e9 um pat\u00f3geno hemibiotr\u00f3fico que \n\napresenta crescimento lento in vitro. O isolamento de DNA de boa qualidade em \n\nquantidades adequadas n\u00e3o \u00e9 uma tarefa f\u00e1cil devido \u00e0 falta de um protocolo padr\u00e3o e \n\na dificuldade de cultivar P. ulei em condi\u00e7\u00f5es de laborat\u00f3rio. Embora o MDF seja \n\nconhecido por mais de um s\u00e9culo, informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a estrutura gen\u00e9tica na regi\u00e3o \n\namaz\u00f4nica, seu centro de origem, permanecem desconhecidas. Neste trabalho foram \n\navaliados protocolos adequados para a extra\u00e7\u00e3o de DNA e a estrutura gen\u00e9tica da \n\npopula\u00e7\u00e3o de P. ulei na regi\u00e3o amaz\u00f4nica. Foram comparados seis protocolos de \n\nextra\u00e7\u00e3o em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a pureza e ao rendimento do DNA. Um total de 61 isolados foram \n\namostrados ao longo das bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas Madeira, Purus e Juru\u00e1 localizadas na \n\nregi\u00e3o amaz\u00f4nica e genotipados para 12 locos SSR. O protocolo de extra\u00e7\u00e3o de DNA \n\nde Doyle e Doyle foi o \u00fanico que apresentou concentra\u00e7\u00e3o consistente e melhor \n\nqualidade do DNA extra\u00eddo. Houve desequil\u00edbrio de liga\u00e7\u00e3o entre os alelos e \n\ndiferencia\u00e7\u00e3o gen\u00e9tica entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es geograficamente distantes foi detectada. A \n\nan\u00e1lise de componentes principais revelou agrupamento dos isolados de acordo com \n\nos limites das bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas. Foram formados dois grupos, um constitu\u00eddo pelos \n\nindiv\u00edduos da bacia do rio Madeira e o outro composto por indiv\u00edduos dos rios Purus \n\ne Juru\u00e1.\n\nvi \n\n\n\n \n \n\n1 \n \n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o geral \n\n \n\nA seringueira (Hevea brasiliensis) \u00e9 a principal fonte de borracha natural \n\nutilizada nos setores m\u00e9dico/farmac\u00eautico, constru\u00e7\u00e3o civil, cal\u00e7ados, m\u00f3veis, \n\nautope\u00e7as, maquin\u00e1rio industrial e agr\u00edcola (Pereira et al., 2000; Bega, 2004; van \n\nBeilen e Poirier, 2007). Apesar da composi\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica da borracha sint\u00e9tica \n\nassemelhar-se \u00e0 da borracha natural, suas propriedades f\u00edsicas s\u00e3o inferiores e \n\nimpossibilitam seu uso na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rios produtos, como por exemplo, a \n\nfabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de pneus para avi\u00f5es, autom\u00f3veis, caminh\u00f5es e \u00f4nibus (Mera, 1977; Santos \n\ne Moth\u00e9, 2007). Dentre os fatores f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicos que fazem da borracha natural um \n\nproduto insubstitu\u00edvel para diversas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es, est\u00e3o a elasticidade, resili\u00eancia, \n\nresist\u00eancia \u00e0 ruptura, isolamento e impermeabilidade a l\u00edquidos e gases (Lieberei, \n\n2007; Mooney, 2009). \n\nOs maiores produtores mundiais de borracha natural s\u00e3o a Tail\u00e2ndia, Indon\u00e9sia \n\ne Mal\u00e1sia, pa\u00edses localizados no sudeste asi\u00e1tico (FAO, 2018). \u00c1sia e \u00c1frica s\u00e3o \n\ncontinentes livres do fungo Pseudocercospora ulei, agente etiol\u00f3gico do mal das folhas \n\nda seringueira, tamb\u00e9m chamada de SALB (South American leaf blight), a principal \n\ndoen\u00e7a de H. brasiliensis. Existe uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o de pesquisadores com rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 \n\nposs\u00edvel introdu\u00e7\u00e3o dessa doen\u00e7a em planta\u00e7\u00f5es da \u00c1frica e, principalmente, da \u00c1sia \n\n(van Beilen e Poirier, 2007), uma vez que este continente \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel por \n\naproximadamente 90% da produ\u00e7\u00e3o mundial de borracha natural (FAO, 2018) e a \n\nmaioria dos clones cultivados \u00e9 considerada suscet\u00edvel ao SALB (Le Guen et al., \n\n2002). Na Am\u00e9rica Latina, o fungo devastou cultivos de seringueira estabelecidos no \n\nestado do Par\u00e1, Brasil, no s\u00e9culo XX (Dean, 1987), contribuindo para que o pa\u00eds \n\npassasse de exportador para importador. Embora o Brasil ainda apresente uma extensa \n\n\u00e1rea para a instala\u00e7\u00e3o de seringais e condi\u00e7\u00f5es edafoclim\u00e1ticas altamente favor\u00e1veis \n\n(Gasparotto et al., 1997), a presen\u00e7a de P. ulei em todas as regi\u00f5es produtoras \n\n(Gasparotto et al., 1997; 2012) \u00e9 um dos fatores respons\u00e1veis pelo baixo \n\ndesenvolvimento da heveicultura no pa\u00eds. Al\u00e9m de diminuir a produ\u00e7\u00e3o do l\u00e1tex, o mal \n\ndas folhas pode levar a planta \u00e0 morte quando ocorrem infec\u00e7\u00f5es sucessivas \n\n(Gasparotto et al., 1989). \n\nO agente causal de SALB pertence ao filo Ascomycota, classe Ascomycetes, \n\nordem Capnodiales e fam\u00edlia Mycosphaerellaceae (Hora J\u00fanior et al., 2014). \u00c9 um \n\nfungo hemibiotr\u00f3fico que provoca doen\u00e7a apenas nas plantas do g\u00eanero Hevea \n\n\n\n \n \n\n2 \n \n\n(Junqueira et al., 1986). O cultivo deste pat\u00f3geno in vitro \u00e9 dif\u00edcil e, ao longo dos anos, \n\ndiversos autores t\u00eam tentado melhorar metodologias para o crescimento em condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nde laborat\u00f3rio (Chee, 1978; Lieberei et al., 1983; Junqueira et al., 1984; 1985; 1986; \n\nMattos, 1999). A melhor estrat\u00e9gia para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o do pat\u00f3geno \u00e9 o isolamento \n\nrealizado de forma direta, a partir da transfer\u00eancia de con\u00eddios presentes em les\u00f5es \n\nfoliares recentes, devido a curta viabilidade dos esporos (Junqueira et al., 1984; \n\nGasparotto et al., 1997). Em meio de cultura batata-sacarose-\u00e1gar (BSA), a germina\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo con\u00eddio se inicia ap\u00f3s 3h de incuba\u00e7\u00e3o a 24\u00b0C, seguido da r\u00e1pida emiss\u00e3o do tubo \n\ngerminativo e crescimento das hifas prim\u00e1rias ap\u00f3s 24h (Junqueira et al., 1984). \n\nEntretanto, o pat\u00f3geno apresenta crescimento lento em diversos meios de cultura \n\n(Chee, 1978; Lieberei et al., 1983; Junqueira et al., 1984; 1985; 1986; Mattos, 1999) e \n\ncomumente observa-se apenas a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de um mic\u00e9lio incipiente com a produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npredominante de tecido estrom\u00e1tico negro ap\u00f3s dois meses (Junqueira et al., 1984). \n\nFungos que produzem estruturas de colora\u00e7\u00e3o escura normalmente produzem \n\nmelanina, que s\u00e3o compostos associados \u00e0 patog\u00eanese e sobreviv\u00eancia (Kwon-Chung \n\ne Rhodes, 1986). No entanto, durante a extra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cido nucl\u00e9ico, esses compostos \n\nconstituem um desafio para o isolamento de DNA de boa qualidade e em quantidade \n\nadequada (Isla-Flores et al., 2006). A obten\u00e7\u00e3o de DNA puro \u00e9 o primeiro passo para \n\na realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de estudos baseados em PCR (Rea\u00e7\u00e3o em Cadeia da Polimerase) (Costa e \n\nMoura, 2001), dentre os quais est\u00e1 a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de marcadores moleculares para a \n\ngenotipagem de pat\u00f3genos biotr\u00f3ficos ou que crescem lentamente (Milgroom, 2015). \n\nExistem diversos marcadores gen\u00e9ticos baseados em PCR, os que s\u00e3o loco n\u00e3o \n\nespec\u00edfico e os loco-espec\u00edfico, como os microssat\u00e9lites. Estes marcadores s\u00e3o \n\nsequ\u00eancias simples repetidas em tandem de at\u00e9 seis nucleot\u00eddeos em tamanho, \n\nlocalizados ao longo do genoma dos organismos (Milgroom et al., 2015). Em virtude \n\ndo seu alto polimorfismo e seletividade neutra t\u00eam sido muito utilizados para estudos \n\nde gen\u00e9tica de popula\u00e7\u00f5es (Ellegren, 2004; Schlotterer, 2004). A gen\u00e9tica de \n\npopula\u00e7\u00f5es compreende quest\u00f5es referentes aos processos evolutivos e demogr\u00e1ficos \n\ninferidos a partir da estrutura populacional, que consiste no padr\u00e3o de diversidade \n\ngen\u00e9tica dentro e entre popula\u00e7\u00f5es (Milgroom, 2015). \u00c9 preciso conhecer a estrutura \n\ngen\u00e9tica e os mecanismos que determinam a quantidade e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o da variabilidade \n\ngen\u00e9tica na popula\u00e7\u00e3o de fitopat\u00f3genos para entender o desenvolvimento da doen\u00e7a, \n\nprever a sua evolu\u00e7\u00e3o e estabelecer estrat\u00e9gias para o melhoramento visando \u00e0 \n\nresist\u00eancia e \u00e0 durabilidade dos clones resistentes selecionados (Milgroom e Fry, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n3 \n \n\n1997). Trabalhos sobre a variabilidade de P. ulei foram recentemente conduzidos (Le \n\nGuen et al., 2004; Barr\u00e8s et al., 2012; Hora J\u00fanior, 2012), mas at\u00e9 o momento n\u00e3o \n\nexistem estudos sobre a gen\u00e9tica molecular de popula\u00e7\u00f5es do pat\u00f3geno no seu prov\u00e1vel \n\ncentro de origem, a regi\u00e3o amaz\u00f4nica.

Thus, the objective of the present \n\nwork was to assess methods for the extraction of P. ulei DNA. Six methods of DNA \n\nextraction were compared: 1. High quality DNA extraction; 2. High quality DNA \n\nextraction plus melanin removal; 3. Modified high quality DNA extraction; 4. Doyle \n\nand Doyle protocol; 5. Modified Doyle and Doyle protocol plus melanin removal and \n\n6. Modified Doyle and Doyle protocol. The concentration of the DNA obtained was \n\nmeasured using fluorescence-based technology, the quality estimated by 260/280 and \n\n260/230 ratios using spectrophotometer and the integrity verified by agarose gel \n\nelectrophoresis. Additionally, the DNA was amplified with the ITS1 and ITS4 primers. \n\nThere was variation among the protocols tested, but all yielded good amounts of DNA. \n\nProtocol 4 was consistently adequate when comparing concentration and quality, in \n\nboth runs of the experiment. Thus, the original Doyle and Doyle (1990) protocol can be \n\nused for extraction of P. ulei DNA. \n\n \n\nKey words: South American leaf blight, Microcyclus ulei, CTAB, method, \npurification. \n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n8 \n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nSouth American leaf blight (SALB) is the most destructive disease of rubber \n\ntree (Hevea brasiliensis) in humid areas of South and Central Americas (Lieberei, \n\n2007). The disease is caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora ulei, which infects \n\nyoung leaves inducing repeated defoliation, dieback of the canopy, and death of \n\nsusceptible clones under favorable environmental condition (Holliday, 1970; Chee and \n\nHolliday, 1986; Lieberei, 2007; Gasparotto et al, 2012). \n\nThe pathogen can form distinct structures when developing on rubber tree \n\nplants (Chee and Holiday, 1986). When deposited in new leaflets, the ascospores absorb \n\nmoisture, germinate, form the germ tube and produce appresoria, from which the \n\ninfecting hyphae develop. The pathogen penetrates host tissue directly, colonizing the \n\nfoliar tissue intercellularly through the parenchyma (Liberei, 2007) and after five or \n\nsix days, leaflets can have lesions with poorly developed stroma covered by conidia \n\n(asexual reproduction). One to five months after infection, ascospores are produced \n\ninside pseudothecia immersed in well developed black stroma on the surface of the \n\nremaining leaflets (sexual reproduction) (Gasparotto et al., 2012; Hora J\u00fanior et al., \n\n2014). Under controlled conditions, in laboratory and growth chamber, sexual \n\nstructures are not formed and the development of asexual structures is not as fast as in \n\nvivo (Holliday, 1970; Chee, 1978; Junqueira et al., 1984). \n\nThe slow development of P. ulei has made difficult the research on the biology, \n\nepidemiology, and physiology of the pathogen under controlled conditions, \n\nparticularly in the laboratory (Holliday, 1970; Chee, 1978; Junqueira et al., 1984; \n\nSousa, 2010). In old cultures (30 days or older) stromata are commonly formed \n\n(Junqueira et al., 1984). Stromata are a mass of hyphae that are commonly rounded \n\nand with a firm consistency that harbor reproductive structures (Krugner and Bachi, \n\n2012). However, in vitro, it is common to form a compact mass of hyphae, firm, dark, \n\nvery slow growing, often developing either downwards (buried) or upwards (\u201caerial\u201d-\n\nlike) in the culture medium (Holliday, 1970; Chee, 1978; Chee and Holliday, 1986). \n\nVariation in growth pattern with little mycelium and production of more freely conidia \n\ncan also be observed (Holliday, 1970). Transfers of pieces of stromata older than 20 \n\ndays may delay the development of subsequent cultures and even suppress the \n\nproduction of mycelia and spores (Junqueira et al., 1984). In 15-day-old cultures or \n\n\n\n \n \n\n9 \n \n\nolder there is a decrease in the production of conidia by auto-inhibition. Younger \n\ncultures (up to 12-days-old) are more likely to present mycelial growth and a large \n\nnumber of spores can be formed in M4 medium (Junqueira et al., 1984). \n\nThe dark color of stromata tissue may indicate the presence of melanin, a \n\npigment commonly observed in many fungi (Beltr\u00e1n-Garc\u00eda et al., 2014). P. ulei is \n\ncurrently classified in the Mycosphaerellaceae family (Hora J\u00fanior et al., 2014) \n\ntogether with Mycosphaerella fijiensis which also forms stromata rich in 1,8-\n\ndihydroxynaphthalene (DHN)\u2013melanin (Beltr\u00e1n-Garc\u00eda et al., 2014). Melanin is \n\nnegatively charged (anionic), which implies the presence of a large amount of free \n\ncarboxylic acid residues in its polymer, and as a result they bind to the nucleic acid \n\nduring the homogenization of mycelium (Hearing, 1999). This binding generally \n\nresults in the co-precipitation with DNA and RNA and absorption of ultraviolet light. \n\nThis can interfere with the polymerase chain reaction, cDNA synthesis and induce \n\nerrors in the interpretations of nucleic acid quantification (Eckhart et al., 2000; \n\nSatyamoorthy et al., 2002). \n\nGood quality DNA in proper amounts are key features for many applications \n\nin genomics. Thus, methods for efficient DNA extraction and capable of producing \n\npure molecules, free of inhibitors, are in high demand (Fulton et al., 1995; Romano \n\nand Brasileiro, 1999; Costa and Moura, 2011). Some molecular analysis require good \n\nDNA quantity and quality (Oliveira et al., 2013). For the analysis of short sequences \n\nrepeats (SSR) or microsatellites and sequencing, for example, the requirements for \n\nquantity and quality are not so stringent: small amounts of relatively low quality DNA \n\ncan be used. On the other hand, for other tasks such as whole genome sequencing, \n\nrestriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), genotyping by sequencing \n\n(GBS) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), high amounts of high \n\nquality DNA must be provided (Liesack et al., 1991; Wintzingerode et al., 1997). \n\nDifferent DNA isolation protocols, which vary according to the organism and \n\ntissue of interest, can be promptly found in the literature (Dellaporta et al., 1983; \n\nWilson et al., 1992; He et al., 1995; Prakash et al., 1996). Most of these protocols are \n\nbased on the use of the cationic detergent cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) \n\n(Doyle and Doyle, 1990; Ferreira and Grattapaglia, 1998; Mercado et al., 1999). \n\nCTAB solubilizes membranes and forms a complex with DNA facilitating \n\nprecipitation (Weising et al., 1995) and removal of polysaccharides and proteins \n\n(Carninci and Hayashizaki, 1999; Knapp and Chandlee, 1996; Lagonigro et al., 2004). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n10 \n \n\nMixed alkyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (MATAB) is another detergent used for \n\nDNA extraction, usually added to the lysis buffer (Wilson et al., 1992; He et al., 1995; \n\nPrakash et al., 1996), but has also been used in the purification of the aqueous phase \n\n(Rodrigues et al., 2007). The use of 2% MATAB in the aqueous phase purification \n\nof Bixa orellana RNA was efficient to avoid co-precipitation of polysaccharides and \n\npolyphenols, resulting in the precipitation of nucleic acids free of these contaminants \n\n(Rodrigues et al., 2007). Protocols with similar components have been used to extract \n\nDNA of P. ulei (Richards et al., 1994; Rivas et al. 2004; Bourassa et al., 2005). \n\nMultiple criteria are used to evaluate the efficiency of DNA extraction \n\nmethods, including, but not restricted to, yield, reproducibility and representativeness \n\nof the isolated DNA (Yuan et al., 2012). Due to the inherent characteristics of each \n\nfungus such as cell wall composition it is necessary to consider a specific protocol that \n\nallows obtaining DNA of quality and, if possible, with high yield (Manian et al., 2001; \n\nSelitrennikoff 2001; Yeo and Wong, 2002). According to Manian et al. (2001), each \n\nspecies may require a particular protocol that is efficient for DNA isolation since there \n\nis no adequate method of cell lysis for all fungi. Selecting an appropriate DNA \n\nextraction protocol for the species of interest may be difficult in view of the variety of \n\nmethods available. To date, there is no standardized DNA isolation protocol for P. \n\nulei, which may be linked to the difficulty for in vitro cultivation and maintenance of \n\nthis fungus due to its slow growing nature and short viability. Therefore, the aim of \n\nthis study was to identify DNA extraction protocols suitable for the isolation of DNA \n\nfrom P. ulei. \n\n \n\nMaterial and methods \n\n \nSampling and isolation of Pseudocercospora ulei \n\n \nSamples of leaves with typical SALB symptoms were collected according to a \n\nW- walking pattern in rubber tree plantations in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. Conidia \n\nwere transferred from the lesions to M4 culture medium (Junqueira et al., 1985) under \n\nthe stereoscopic microscope and plates were kept in the dark for 30 days at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C. \n\nApproximately 100 mg of stromata were removed from the culture medium and \n\nmacerated in 500 \u00b5 l of water, spread on Petri dishes containing M4 medium and \n\ncultivated for 12 days at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C under a specific regime of daily alternation of two \n\n\n\n \n \n\n11 \n \n\ncycles of 1h light and 3h of dark, 1h light, 3h of dark (totaling 2h light and 6h dark), \n\nfollowed by 1h light and 15h of dark to stimulate the conidial production (Junqueira \n\net al., 1985). Spores were used to prepare a suspension which was then plated in water-\n\nagar medium and incubated for 5h for conidia germination. Single conidia was \n\ntransferred to M4 medium and incubated at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with 12h photoperiod. Among \n\nthe monosporic isolates available, three were randomly selected for the experiments: \n\nAM18, RPE2 and MAN3P4. \n\n \nCultivation conditions and sample preparation \n \n\nStroma fragment, approximately 100 mg, of each isolate was macerated and \n\ntransferred to erlenmeyers containing M4 liquid medium, which were kept in an orbital \n\nshaker at 120 rpm for 15 days in the dark at 24\u00b0C. Fungal biomass produced was dried \n\nat room temperature for 24 h, ground in liquid nitrogen until it became a fine powder \n\nand frozen at -80\u00b0C. Twenty five milligrams of macerated biomass from each sample \n\nwere used for each repetition in all DNA extraction protocols. \n\n \nMethods of DNA extraction \n \n\nSix DNA extraction protocols described in the literature were modified as \n\nnecessary and evaluated for P. ulei (Table 1). All experiments were conducted with \n\nfive replicates (one erlenmeyer with culture = one replicate) of each sample. The \n\nexperiment was conducted in two different occasions. \n\nProtocol 1- High quality DNA extraction (Spanu et al., 1995). Fungal tissue (25 mg) \n\nand 1.168 ml of lysis buffer (430 l of buffer A \u2013 Sorbitol, Tris-HCl pH 9, EDTA, pH \n\n8; 430 l of buffer B \u2013 Tris-HCl pH 9, EDTA pH 8, NaCl, 2% CTAB; 170 l of buffer \n\nC - N- lauroylsarcosine sodium salt; 130 l of PVP; 8 l of Proteinase K) were added \n\nto a microtube, mixed by vortexing and incubated at 65\u00b0C for 30 min. After incubation, \n\n385 l of KAc (5M, pH 7.5) was added and the tubes were immediately placed on ice \n\nfor 30 min. The mixture was homogenized and centrifuged at 5,000?g for 20 min at \n\n4\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed and transferred to another microtube containing 1 \n\nml of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v). The mixture was stirred for 10-15 s by \n\nvortexing and centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The samples were treated with \n\nRNAse A (100 g/ml) and incubated in dry bath for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. DNA was precipitated \n\nwith ?0 l of sodium acetate and 900 l of isopropanol at room temperature and \n\n\n\n \n \n\n12 \n \n\nincubated for 5 min at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 g \n\nfor 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The \u201cpellet\u201d was washed with 300 \u00b5l of 70 % ethanol and \n\ncentrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was carefully removed and \n\ndiscarded. The \u201cpellet\u201d was kept at room temperature to dry and resuspended in 30 \u00b5 L \n\nof TE (Tris-EDTA) buffer at 65\u00b0C for 2 h and immediately stored at ?80\u00b0C. \n\nProtocol 2- High quality DNA extraction (Spanu et al., 1995) plus melanin removal \n\n(Lagonigro et al. 2004): Genomic DNA was extracted following the procedure \n\ndescribed in protocol 1, with additional steps for melanin removal as described by \n\nLagonigro et al. (2004). An aliquot of 200 \u00b5 l of water, 65 \u00b5 l of NaCl and 800 \u00b5 l of \n\nCTAB-Urea solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 1% CTAB, 4 M urea, 1 mM EDTA) \n\nwere added to DNA previously extracted. The solution was mixed gently and incubated \n\nat 4\u00b0C overnight. The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C for DNA \n\nprecipitation. The \u201cpellet\u201d was resuspended with 200 \u00b5 l of guanidine hydrochloride \n\nand 400 \u00b5 l of 100% ethanol. The mixture was incubated for 1 h on ice and centrifuged \n\nat 12,000 g for 15 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded and the \n\nDNA \u201cpellet\u201d was washed twice with 70% ethanol, centrifuged and dried at room \n\ntemperature. DNA was resuspended in 30 \u00b5 l of TE buffer at 65\u00b0C for 2 h and stored \n\nat ?80\u00b0C. \n\nProtocol 3- Modified high quality DNA extraction. A modified version of protocol 1. \n\nLysis buffer (1.168 ml) was added to 25 mg of fungal tissue and the mixture was kept \n\nfor 30 min at 65\u00b0C, inverting the tubes at 5 min intervals. Then, the polysaccharides \n\nwere precipitated with 385 \u00b5 l of KAc on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 5,000 g for \n\n15 min at 4\u00b0C. After centrifugation, 300 \u00b5 l of 2% MATAB and 300 \u00b5 l of chloroform-\n\nisoamyl alcohol (24:1) mixture were added to the microtube and centrifuged at 4,000 g \n\nfor 10 min at 4\u00b0C for the separation of phases. This step was repeated if the supernatant \n\nhad dark color (light to dark brown). The top aqueous phase was transferred to a clean \n\n2 ml microtube containing 10 \u00b5 l of RNAse A (final concentration of 100 \u00b5 g/ml) and \n\nincubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. DNA was precipitated with 100 \u00b5 l of NaAc and 1000 \u00b5 l of \n\ncold isopropanol and the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The \n\nDNA samples were washed twice with 500 l of 70% ice-cold ethanol, centrifuged at \n\n10,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and resuspended in 30 \u00b5 l of TE buffer at 65\u00b0C for 2 h. \n\nProtocol 4- Doyle and Doyle extraction (1990). Fungal material was ground in liquid \n\nnitrogen and incubated in 800 \u00b5 l of the isolation buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8; 1,4 \n\n\n\n \n \n\n13 \n \n\nM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA; 2% CTAB; 0,2% 2-mercaptoethanol) at 60\u00b0C for 60 min. \n\nAfter incubation, 800 \u00b5 l of chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) was added to the \n\nmixture to separate the phases, and centrifuged at 7,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. DNA \n\nprecipitation was obtained after adding 600 \u00b5 l of cold isopropanol and centrifugation \n\nat 3,000 g for 2 min at 4\u00b0C. The DNA \u201cpellet\u201d was kept in the wash buffer (76% \n\nethanol, 10 mM ammonium acetate) for 20 min, centrifuged at 4000 g for 2 min and \n\nresuspended in 50 \u00b5 l of resuspension buffer (10 mM ammonium acetate; 0,25 mM \n\nEDTA). For RNA removing, 6 \u00b5 l of RNAse A (final concentration of 10 g\u00b7mL-1) \n\nwere added to the solution and kept in dry bath for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. DNA was \n\nprecipitated with a mix of 200 \u00b5 l of water, 150 \u00b5 l of ammonium acetate and 1000 \u00b5 l \n\nof ethanol, centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4\u00b0 C, dry at room temperature, resuspended in 30 \n\n\u00b5 l of TE buffer at 65\u00b0C for 2 h and stored at -80\u00b0C. \n\nProtocol 5- Modified Doyle and Doyle protocol (1990) plus melanin removal \n\n(Lagonigro et al., 2004). Protocol 4 was used with an additional procedure for melanin \n\nremoval. Briefly, 200 \u00b5 l of water, 65 \u00b5 l of NaCl and 800 \u00b5 l of CTAB-Urea solution \n\nwere added to DNA extracted and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. DNA \n\nwas precipitated and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. The pellet was \n\nresuspended in 200 \u00b5 l of guanidine hydrochloride and 400 \u00b5 l of 100% ethanol. This \n\nmixture was kept for 1 h on ice bath and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 15 min. The \n\nsupernatant was discarded and the DNA \u201cpellet\u201d was washed twice with 70% ethanol, \n\ncentrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00ba C and dried at room temperature. DNA was \n\nresuspended in 30 \u00b5 l of TE buffer at 65\u00b0C for 2 h and stored at -80\u00b0C. \n\nProtocol 6- Modified Doyle and Doyle protocol. Protocol 4 was used with minor \n\nmodifications. Each sample containing 2X CTAB buffer was incubated at 60\u00b0C for 60 \n\nmin. After incubation, 300 \u00b5 l of 2% MATAB and 300 \u00b5l of chloroform-isoamyl \n\nalcohol (24:1 v/v) was added to the mixture and centrifuged at 7,000 g for 10 min at \n\n4\u00b0 C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new microtube containing 800 \u00b5 l of cold \n\nisopropanol and centrifuged at 3000 g for 2 min at 4\u00b0C for \u201cpellet\u201d formation, which \n\nwas kept in the wash buffer for 20 min in room temperature. The suspension was \n\ncentrifuged at 4000 g for 2 min at 4\u00b0 C. The top phase was discarded and DNA \u201cpellet\u201d \n\nresuspended in 50 \u00b5 l of resuspension buffer (same buffer described in protocol 4) with \n\naddition of 8 \u00b5l of RNAse A (final concentration 100 g\u00b7mL-1). This solution was \n\nincubated at 37\u00b0 C for 30 min and 200 \u00b5 l of water, 150 \u00b5 l of ammonium acetate and \n\n\n\n \n \n\n14 \n \n\n1000 \u00b5 l of ethanol were added. The mix was centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4\u00b0 C for DNA \n\nprecipitation, dried at room temperature, resuspended in 30 \u00b5 l of TE buffer at 65\u00b0C for \n\n2 h and stored at -80\u00b0 C. DNA integrity and quantification. \n\nThe integrity of the DNA was verified by horizontal electrophoresis at 80 V for \n\n2 h, on 0.8% agarose gel followed by staining with Bromophenol Blue dye and the \n\nGelRED\u00ae intercalating agent, in 1X TBE buffer (0.089M Tris base, 0.089M Boric \n\nacid, 0.002M EDTA pH 8.0). The band patterns were compared with -phage DNA \n\nmarker (100 ?g. L-1). The purity of the DNA was evaluated using the 260/280 and \n\n260/230 ratios in NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific\u00ae). \n\nAdditionally, the quantity of genomic DNA was determined by using the fluorescence-\n\nbased Qubit technology as described by the manufacturer (Thermo Scientific\u00ae). \n\n \nAmplification through PCR \n \n\nTo confirm the integrity and quality of the extracted DNA, a sample of each \n\ncombination isolate-protocol of extraction (treatment) was tested by PCR \n\namplification with the ITS1 and ITS4 primers that amplify the region around ITS1, \n\n5.8S, and ITS2. PCR reactions were conducted at a final volume of 12.5 l, containing \n\n1 l DNA (20 ng. L-1), 6.2 l of Milli-Q H2O, 0.5 l DMSO (Dimethyl sulfoxide), \n\n0.5 l dNTP\u2019s (2.5 mM each), 0.5 l Forward Primer (5 pmoles.mL-1), 0.5 l Reverse \n\nPrimer (5 pmoles.mL- 1), 0.75 l MgCl2 (50 mM), 2.5 l 5X Colorless GoTaq\u00ae \n\nReaction Buffer and 0.05 l Taq DNA polymerase (5 U. L-1). The conditions were \n\noptimized according to the recommendations for the Promega GoTaq\u00ae enzyme. The \n\nannealing temperature was set at 58\u00b0C. \n\nThe resulting amplification products were stained with GelRED\u00ae intercalating \n\nagent and separated by electrophoresis using 1X TBE buffer on a 2% agarose gel at \n\n100 V for 60 min. The 100bp DNA ladder (Invitrogen) was used as molecular weight \n\npattern. \n\n \nData analysis \n \n\nKruskal-Wallis test was conduced to evaluate the effect of extraction protocols \n\non DNA concentration in the experiments 1 and 2. All analyses were processed with \n\nR version 3.4.3 program (Boettiger and Eddelbuettel, 2017; R Core Team, 2017).  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n15 \n \n\nResults \n\n \nThere was variation regarding the extraction protocol that provided higher \n\nyield of DNA between the two experiments repeated in time. In the experiment 1, the \n\nhighest amount of DNA was obtained with the modified high quality DNA extraction \n\nprotocol (protocol 3) and the least efficient was the DNA extraction protocol of Doyle \n\nand Doyle (protocol 5). In the second experiment, the best protocol was 5 and the \n\nmethods of high quality DNA extraction (protocol 1) and protocol 3 extracted the least \n\namounts of nucleic acid (Figure 1). Although protocols 3 and 5 showed a higher \n\nconcentration of extracted DNA, they did not differ significantly from high quality \n\nDNA extraction plus melanin removal (protocol 2) and Doyle and Doyle extraction \n\nmethods (protocol 4), for which consistent behavior was observed in both the \n\nexperiments 1 and 2 (Figure 1). \n\nIn the two experiments conducted, the best 260/280 nm ratio was reached by \n\nprotocols 4 and 6. High absorbance was detected for DNA extracted with protocol 1 \n\n(> 2.0) and a very low ratio with protocol 5 (<1.8). The results for protocol 3 varied \n\nbetween experiments (Figure 2). The 260/230 nm ratio was satisfactory for protocol 4 \n\nand it was very low for protocol 5 (<2.0). Protocols 1 and 3 also had a 260/230 nm ratio \n\n&lt;2.0, unlike the values found for 2 and 6 (> 2.2) (Figure 3). \n\nThe integrity of the extracted DNA samples was analyzed on agarose gel by \n\nelectrophoresis and all the isolation methods had a DNA band. The intensity of the \n\nbands varied between the extraction protocols and between the isolates. RNA bands \n\nwere detected in samples extracted with protocols 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 4). \n\nIn relation to the PCR amplification with the ITS1 and ITS4 primers, all \n\nsamples had PCR amplicons. The PCR products were of approximately 600 bp. All \n\nappeared as a well defined band on gel, consistent and free of impurities (Figure 5). \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\n \n\nEach extraction protocol had its own pros and cons, although all methods of \n\nisolation have produced relatively large amounts of DNA. The good performance of \n\na given protocol is probably related to the use of CTAB in lysis buffer since when \n\nincorporated into the extraction buffer it removes membranes, lipids and promotes \n\ncell lysis even though the tissue is rich in polysaccharides and contaminated by \n\n\n\n \n \n\n16 \n \n\nexcess metabolites such as fungal structures (Sambrook and Russell 2001, Michiels \n\net al 2003, Xu et al 2004, Athanasio et al, 2016). In addition, it still removes proteins \n\nfrom DNA (Moore and Dowhan 1995). Although protocols 3 and 5 have been \n\noutstanding in terms of DNA concentration, it is difficult to consider them to be the \n\nbest protocols due to the variation observed between the experiments. The \n\ndifference in the results obtained for the two experiments on DNA yield is probably \n\nassociated with the growth of the fungus that, under in vitro conditions, produces \n\nincipient mycelium, conidia and stromal tissue (Junqueira et al., 1984). Therefore, \n\nthree hypotheses can be raised about the differences in results: i. The presence of a \n\ngreater amount of stromal tissue, conidia or mycelium in each repetition can \n\ninfluence the concentration of extracted DNA; ii. The successive repications \n\ndecreased the mycelial production and sporulation of the pathogen in some \n\nrepetitions, and stromal material predominated, consequently, there was variation \n\nin the amount of extracted DNA; and iii. The stroma is melanized and the variation \n\nin the amount of melanin in the different isolates resulted in fluctuations between \n\nthe experiments. \n\nThe first hypothesis seems to be more appropriate because, although the \n\nfungal biomass used in each repetition has gone through the same process before \n\nthe extraction, it is not possible to know exactly what type of structure and how \n\nmuch they contributed as fungal biomass in each repetition. In addition, in some \n\norganisms the number of copies of the chromosome may vary according to the \n\ngrowth stages (Cooper and Helmstetter, 1968; Donachie, 2001). Thus, it is \n\nnecessary to try a standardization of the number of chromosome copies of the in \n\ninitial tissue to be used for DNA. One way to do this would be to extract DNA from \n\nthe different structures produced by the pathogen, separately. \n\nProtocols 2 and 4 were consistent in both experiments and, thus, are the most \n\nrepresentative regarding DNA concentration. In addition, total genomic DNA \n\nextracted with protocol 4 showed good quality considering that values for the \n\n260/280 nm (1.8 - 2.0) and for the 260/230 nm ratio (2.0 - 2.2) were obtained. On \n\nthe other hand, for protocol 2 values above the expected absorbance range were \n\nobserved. The values should be between 1.8 and 2.0 and between 2.0 and 2.2 for the \n\n260/280 and 260/230 nm ratios, respectively. Values outside this range indicate the \n\npresence of proteins, phenol or other contaminants that are absorbed by the 280 and \n\n230 nm peaks (Teare et al., 1997). The DNA obtained with protocols 1 and 5 did \n\n\n\n \n \n\n17 \n \n\nnot have high purity, since 260/280 and 260/230 nm ratios were observed to be lower \n\nor slightly higher than the tolerated range. Variations in the 260/280 nm ratio are \n\nassociated with small changes in the pH of the DNA solution. When the 260/280 nm \n\nratio is underrepresented and overrepresented by 0.2-0.3, the DNA is likely to be \n\nfound in acid solutions and basic solutions, respectively (Wilfinger et al., 1997). If \n\nthe 260/280 nm ratio is less than 1.8, protein contamination or the presence of \n\norganic contaminants such as phenol or other aromatic compounds is suggested. \n\nHowever, no phenol was used in any of the protocols tested in the present study, so \n\nit is likely that the samples are contaminated with some type of protein. The 260/230 \n\nnm ratio appreciably less than 1.8 indicates the presence of contaminants having \n\nabsorbance at 230 nm, such as the TE buffer (Wilfinger et al., 1997) or some type of \n\nsalt (Dilhari et al., 2017). The potential presence of salts at high concentrations in \n\nDNA samples can be explained by the use of sodium acetate during the precipitation \n\nphase of nucleic acid in protocols 1 and 2 and the use of sodium chloride in protocol \n\n5. \n\nRNA bands were observed in protocols 1, 2, and 3, even after treating samples \n\nfor a relatively long time for RNA removal and using a higher concentration of RNAse \n\nthan in other protocols. The purity of the DNA samples is reduced when RNA is \n\npresent (Romano and Brasileiro, 1999). The extracted DNA should be free of \n\ncontaminants including the presence of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, RNA and any \n\nother cellular constituents that may inhibit the activity of restriction enzymes, ligase \n\nand thermostatic DNA polymerases (Asadzaheh et al., 2010). It is necessary to adjust \n\nthe RNAse treatment to improve the evaluation of the different protocols. \n\nAlthough all protocols resulted in suitable amounts of DNA for amplification, \n\nonly protocol 4 can be recommended at this time to be used in molecular studies that \n\nrequire high-quality DNA of P. ulei. This is a well-known protocol used for plant and \n\nfungal materials (Corr\u00eaa et al., 2013). The reagents used and the procedures adopted \n\ncan be easily found or executed in laboratories on a routine basis. The other protocols \n\ncan be used for other purposes that are not so stringent on DNA quality. However, \n\nexcept for protocol 4, none of the methods tested in this study were consistent. This \n\nresult resembles studies in which researchers have concluded that even for specific \n\nsamples, differences in yield and purity of DNA may occur (Artyukhin and Woo, 2012, \n\nMaaroufi et al 2004, Mirnomeni et al. 2010.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n18 \n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n \nWe thank Ana Ferreira by collection of fungal isolates.

P. H. Rolfs s/n, \n36570-900, Vi\u00e7osa, MG, Brasil \n \nAbstract \n\n \nPseudocercospora ulei is a haploid fungus that causes South American leaf blight \n\n(SALB) of rubber tree in the Amazon region and is a potential threat to the global \n\nsupply of natural rubber if introduced in Asia and Africa. Despite the importance of \n\nSALB, there is no information on the genetic variability of the pathogen in its putative \n\ncenter of origin: the Amazon river basin. Therefore, the genetic structure of P. ulei \n\npopulations in the Amazon region was studied using microsatellite markers. A set of 61 \n\nmonosporic isolates were obtained from planted rubber trees distributed in three \n\ntributaries of the Amazon river: Madeira, Purus and Juru\u00e1 rivers. Isolates were \n\ngenotyped with a set of 12 microsatellite loci. All loci were polymorphic with a mean \n\nof 5.9 alleles per locus. The G\"ST suggested that there is a group formed by isolates \n\ncollected near the Madeira river and a second group with isolates from the Purus and \n\nJuru\u00e1 watersheds. This differentiation between populations can be explained by \n\nisolation by distance or due to different native rubber tree species present in each of \n\nthese regions. The structuring of the P. ulei population resembles that of Hevea spp. \n\n \nKey words: South American leaf blight, population genetics, Microcyclus ulei, \nmolecular epidemiology, SSR \n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n32 \n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \nNatural rubber is a commodity of high commercial value used in more than 40 \n\nthousand products in the global industry, including medical-pharmaceutical devices, \n\nsurgical gloves, aircraft tires and several engineering and consumer products (Lieberei \n\net al., 2007; Gasparotto et al., 2012). The main source of natural rubber is Hevea \n\nbrasiliensis, a species native to the Amazon region (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 1983; Van Beilen \n\nand Poirier, 2007). Due to the great applicability of the raw material for different \n\nproducts, there is an increasing global demand for natural rubber (IRSG, 2017). Asia is \n\nresponsible for more than 90% of the world's natural rubber production, while Latin \n\nAmerica produces only 3%, mainly from Brazil and Guatemala (FAO, 2018). Although \n\nBrazil has a large area available for planting rubber trees (Gasparotto et al., 1997), \n\nyields are limited due to epidemics of South American leaf blight (SALB), an endemic \n\nfungal disease in countries that grow rubber trees in Latin America (P\u00e1ez et al., 2015). \n\nSALB, also known as leaf blight, is caused by a foliar fungal pathogen \n\npreviously named Microcyclus ulei (Holliday, 1970; Chee and Holliday, 1986; \n\nLieberei, 2007; Van Beilen and Poirier, 2007) and currently known as \n\nPseudocercospora ulei (Hora J\u00fanior et al., 2014). The fungus was first observed in the \n\nAmazon region, its probable center of origin, in 1900 in the state of Amazonas, Brazil \n\n(Hennings, 1904). P. ulei is present in all rubber growing regions of the country \n\n(Gasparotto et al., 1997; Mattos et al., 2003) and under favorable environmental \n\nconditions can induce successive defoliation, dieback of the canopy and death of \n\nsusceptible Hevea clones (Holliday, 1970; Chee and Holliday, 1986; Lieberei, 2007). \n\nDue to the severe restrictions in control strategies, the deployment of resistant \n\nclones is considered to be the best option to manage the disease (Garcia et al., 2004). \n\nBreeding programs for SALB resistance were developed in tropical America, Africa \n\nand Asia, but due to the instability of resistance and the low yield of the selected \n\nmaterials, few commercial clones were recommended. The breeding program CIRAD-\n\nMichelin- Brazil (CMB) (Le Guen et al., 2002; Garcia et al., 2004; Garcia et al., 2011), \n\nwas successful in obtaining resistant clones as productive as the Asian ones (Rivano \n\net al., 2010). These clones can be cultivated in areas conducive to SALB (Garcia et al., \n\n2011) or in escape areas. Growing resistant clones is an interesting preventive strategy \n\nto reduce the economic impact anticipated to be generated by the introduction of the \n\npathogen in disease-free areas (Garcia et al., 2004). Although moderately resistant \n\n\n\n \n \n\n33 \n \n\nrubber clones are available (Gasparotto et al., 2012), the success, durability, and large-\n\nscale implementation of control measures depend on detailed knowledge of the \n\nevolutionary, biological and genetic aspects of the disease causal agent and its \n\npopulations (McDonald and Linde, 2002). \n\nGenetic structure comprises the quantification of genetic variation and its \n\ndistribution within and between populations (Milgroom and Peever, 2003). \n\nKnowledge of the genetic structure is important to infer the evolutionary potential of \n\na population, since it can provide an insight into the risk of plant pathogens developing \n\nresistance to fungicides and/or antibiotics, or overcome the resistance of cultivars \n\n(McDonald and Linde, 2002). Breeding programs for the development and strategic \n\nuse of resistant varieties will have higher chances to succeed if the geographical \n\ndistribution of pathogen genotypes is carefully evaluated; when host varieties are \n\nchallenged with representative genotypes; when there is information about movement \n\nof genotypes and the risk of introduction into an area; and the dynamics of genotype \n\nfrequencies over time (Peever et al., 2000). \n\nAlthough research on obtaining SALB resistant clones has progressed over \n\ntime (Peralta et al., 1990; Garcia et al., 2002), most activities were performed without \n\nknowledge of the genetic variability of the population. Parameterization of the \n\nevolutionary mechanisms responsible for shaping genetic variation in the population \n\nis the first step in the study of the population biology of the pathogen. The use of \n\ngenetic markers allows inference on the evolutionary mechanisms: mutation, selection, \n\nmigration (gene flow), recombination, and genetic drift (McDonald, 1997). \n\nThere are several molecular markers that are used for genetic studies of fungal \n\npopulations, but the microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSR), have been \n\nintensively used due to the high level of polymorphism, locus-specificity and \n\ncodominant nature (Dutech et al., 2007). These markers can detect high levels of \n\nvariation, which contributes to increase the resolution of genealogical and genetic \n\nvariability studies (Caixeta et al., 2009). In recent years, microsatellite markers have \n\nbeen used to study the genetic variability of populations of several plant pathogenic \n\nfungi, such as Rhizoctonia solani (Zala et al., 2008), Mycosphaerella fijiensis (Yang \n\nand Zhong, 2008), Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Gomes et al., 2011; Lehner et al., 2015), \n\nZymoseptoria tritici (Suffert et al., 2015), among others (Tucker et al., 2015; Das et al., \n\n2016; Kolmer et al., 2017). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n34 \n \n\nFor a long time, P. ulei isolates from different geographic regions were \n\ncharacterized by inoculation into a range of Hevea spp. clones to examine pathogenic \n\nvariation (\u201craces\u201d) (Junqueira et al., 1?86; Rivano, 1??7; Mattos et al., 2003; Bevenuto \n\net al., 2017). However, in recent years the genetic variability of the populations of the \n\npathogen has been investigated using microsatellite markers (Le Guen et al., 2004; \n\nBarr\u00e8s et al., 2012; Hora J\u00fanior et al., 2012). Fifteen populations of P. ulei were \n\nsampled in the main Brazilian rubber producing regions. Using small and large spatial \n\nscale analytical tools, high genetic variability was found among spatially structured \n\npopulations and rapid genetic differentiation in sympatric populations of the pathogen \n\ndue to selection imposed by partially resistant hosts (Hora J\u00fanior, 2012). Barr\u00e8s et al. \n\n(2012) using a set of 16 microsatellite markers, inferred that the most probable scenario \n\nfor the establishment of P. ulei populations sampled in Ecuador, Costa Rica, French \n\nGuiana and Brazil (a single population from south of Mato Grosso state) was from a \n\nnon-sampled area in the Amazon. Therefore, despite being an interesting study, the \n\nresults were not conclusive due to sampling limitations in potentially informative \n\nareas. \n\nTo date, no molecular analysis to uncover the diversity and evolutionary \n\npotential of the causal agent of SALB in its center of origin, has been performed. As \n\nP. ulei is supposedly originated from the Amazon, a wider sampling of this region will \n\nenable the diversity of its (sub) populations to be better understood, to determine how \n\nthe pathogen populations evolved in the center of origin, and the implications of these \n\nchanges for disease management. Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine \n\nthe genetic structure of the P. ulei population in the Amazon river basin. \n\n \nMaterial and methods \n\n \nSample collection, isolation and extraction of DNA \n\n \n\nLeaves with typical symptoms of SALB were collected from active or \n\nremaining commercial plantations of rubber tree located in Acre (AC) and Amazonas \n\n(AM) states, between 2010 and 2017. Thirty-four isolates from AC were obtained \n\nfrom: Bujari (n = 5), M\u00e2ncio Lima (n = 4), Rio Branco (n = 8), Rodrigues Alves (n = \n\n1) and Xapuri (n = 16). Twenty-seven isolates from AM were sampled from: Beruri (n \n\n= 2), Boca do Acre (n = 7), Eirunep\u00e9 (n = 5), Manaus (n = 3), Manicor\u00e9 (n = 7) and Rio \n\nPreto da Eva (n = 3) (Table 1). The number of individuals obtained per municipality \n\n\n\n \n \n\n35 \n \n\nvaried according to disease incidence and field size. Although several cultures were \n\nattempted from each field, the difficulties to grow the pathogen in vitro prevented \n\nthe standardization of the same number of isolate for each location. In dense \n\nplantations, the sampling was accomplished according to a W-walking pattern and in \n\neach area the latitude and longitude information for each sample were recorded for \n\ngeographic distribution analysis of the isolates. \n\nConidia were collected from lesions under the microscope. Conidia were plated \n\non M4 culture medium (Junqueira et al., 1984) and grown for 30 days at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C in \n\nthe dark. The resulting stroma was macerated in 500 \u00b5 L of mili-Q sterilized water to \n\npromote the release of fungal structures and to obtain a suspension that was poured on \n\nsolid M4 medium and kept for 12 days at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C under a regime of two daily cycles \n\nof light. The first cycle was: 1h of light and 3h of dark, 1h of light, and 3h of dark. The \n\nfirst cycle totaled 2h of light and 6h of dark, followed by the second cycle: 1h light \n\nand 15h dark to stimulate the production of conidia of the pathogen (Junqueira et al., \n\n1985). To obtain monosporic isolates, 5 ml of sterilized distilled water plus one drop \n\nof Tween 20% were added to the conidia produced and an aliquot of the suspension \n\nwas transferred to water-agar. After 5h of incubation, a block of culture medium \n\ncontaining only one germinated conidium was cut, placed on M4 medium, and \n\nincubated at 25 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with photoperiod of 12h until colony development. \n\nThe monosporic isolates were transferred to liquid M4 medium and flasks were \n\nplaced on an orbital shaker at 120 rpm in the dark at 24\u00b0C during 15 days. The fungal \n\nbiomass was then dried at room temperature for 24 h, ground in liquid nitrogen and \n\nkept at -80 \u00b0C until DNA extraction, which was performed as described for Spanu et al. \n\n(1995). The DNA quality and quantity were checked with NanoDrop 2000 \n\nSpectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), while DNA integrity was analyzed \n\nusing electrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel in TBE (0.089M Tris base, 0.089M Boric \n\nacid, 0.002M EDTA pH 8.0). Bromophenol blue dye and the GelRED\u00ae intercalating \n\nagent were added to each well. For subsequent analysis, DNA concentration of each \n\nisolate was adjusted to 20 ng/ L. \n\n \n\nGenotyping \n \n\nPrimer pairs flanking 12 SSR loci were used for genotyping 61 isolates obtained \n\nin this study. Six markers were described by Le Guen et al. (2004) and the others six \n\n\n\n \n \n\n36 \n \n\ndeveloped by Barr\u00e8s et al. (2012). The forward sequences of the primers were labeled \n\nwith the fluorophores dyes NED, 6-FAM or Hex to determine the allelic composition \n\nof more than one locus at a time. Multiplex PCR reactions were performed (Hora \n\nJ\u00fanior, 2012) using Multiplex PCR 5X Master Mix kit as described by the \n\nmanufacturer (New England BioLabs, Inc.). The PCR products were sent to Macrogen \n\nfor fragment analysis using 400 HDTM size standard marker to score alleles with \n\nGeneMarkerTM software V2.7.0 (Soft Genetics). The size of DNA fragments were \n\nmanually binned into alleles according to the number of repeat units at each locus. \n\n \nData analysis \n \n\nAll analyses were performed with the R program version 3.4.3 (R Core Team, \n\n2017). Initially, a genotype accumulation curve was generated with the poppr package \n\nversion 2.6.1 to evaluate evidence of saturation and thus indicate whether the loci used \n\nwere sufficiently sampled to adequately represent the potential set of individuals \n\n(Arnaud-Hanod et al. 2007; Kamvar et al., 2015).  \n\nGenotypic diversity was determined calculating the Stoddart and Taylor's index \n\n(G) (Stoddart and Taylor, 1988), Simpson index (Simpson, 1949), Shannon index (H) \n\n(Shannon, 1948), evenness (E5) (Gr\u00fcnwald et al., 2003) and the number of expected \n\nmultilocus genotypes (eMLH), which was estimated by rarefaction of the population \n\nwith sample size of 10 (Hurlbert, 1971; Heck et al., 1975; Grunwald et al., 2003). Nei\u2019s \n\ngene diversity (1978) was estimated. To evaluate if random mating is occurring in the \n\npopulations, the linkage disequilibrium between the SSR loci was evaluated by \n\nstandardized association index (rd) from clone-corrected data set with 999 \n\npermutations (Brown et al., 1980; Smith et al., 1993; Agapow and Burt, 2001). The \n\nindices of genotype diversity and linkage disequilibrium were calculated with the \n\npoppr package. \n\nHill numbers were calculated based on the MLG frequency of each population \n\nusing the iNEXT (Hsieh et al., 2016) package for R. These numbers correspond to \n\nestimates of genotype richness (0), Shannon index (1) and Simpson concentration \n\nindex (2) (Chao et al., 2014). To compare the Hill numbers, integrated curves that \n\nallow rarefaction and extrapolation were used (Colwell et al., 2012). A 95% confidence \n\ninterval (95% CI) was applied to each curve to compare the diversity in the different \n\npopulations. The genetic differentiation coefficient (G\u201dST), which indicates whether \n\npopulations are segregating by different alleles (G\u201dST = 1) or if there is no \n\n\n\n \n \n\n37 \n \n\ndifferentiation (G\u201dST = 0), was calculated using the mmod package (Hedrick, 2005). \n\nThe analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) with the genetic distance of Bruvo \n\nwas obtained with poppr package to estimate the distribution of variation within and \n\nbetween populations (Excoffier et al., 1992; Bruvo et al., 2004; Kamvar et al., 2014). \n\nIn addition, discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) was performed \n\nusing adegenet version 2.1.0 to infer the number of clusters of genetically related \n\nindividuals (Jombart, 2008). To establish an appropriate number of main components \n\n(PC) for the DAPC analysis, cross validation was performed using the xvalDapc \n\nfunction of the adegenet package. \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\nAnalysis of the genotype accumulation curve reached the plateau (Figure 1) \n\nwith the 12 loci used in this study (Table 2).  \n\nA total of 54 multilocus genotypes were identified among the 61 isolates and 3 \n\nto 12 alleles per locus were detected. The P17 locus had the lowest gene diversity (0.24) \n\nand the least evenness estimate (0.46) (Table 2). The data set was divided into three \n\nsubpopulations, which were defined according to the watersheds of the Amazon river: \n\nMadeira (M), Purus (P) and Juru\u00e1 (J). The highest allelic diversity was obtained for the \n\nP watershed where 2 to 12 alleles per locus were detected, whereas for the J and M \n\nwatersheds the number of alleles per locus was much lower and varied from 1 to 5, \n\nand 1 to 2, respectively (Table 2). \n\nThe number of multilocus genotypes (MLG) detected for the M and J \n\nwatersheds was similar, 8 and 9, respectively. However, each isolate obtained from the \n\nP watershed had a unique MLG (Table 3). The genotypic diversity indices of Shannon \n\n(H), Stoddart and Taylor (G), and Simpson ( ) were highest for the P subpopulation, \n\nwith intermediate values for the J subpopulation and lowest at the M subpopulation \n\n(Table 3). The subpopulations have similar evenness (E5) values, but it equals 1 in the \n\nP subpopulation because each isolate was a unique MLG (Table 3). Lowest gene \n\ndiversity was observed in the M subpopulation (h = 0.17). The estimate is \n\napproximately 3.5 times lower than the average gene diversity estimated for the P and \n\nJ subpopulation (Table 3). \n\n\n\n \n \n\n38 \n \n\nThere was strong evidence of linkage disequilibrium of alleles between loci in \n\nthe total population (rD = 0.061), and in two of the three subpopulations: J (rD = 0.34) \n\nand P (rD = 0.03). Nevertheless, there was no evidence to reject the occurrence of \n\nrandom mating in the M subpopulation (rD = 0.01; p = 0.367) (Table 3). \n\nNo significant difference was observed for Hill numbers when the data were \n\nrarefied. But when the data set was extrapolated, there was greater genotypic richness \n\nand Shanon index for the P population (Figure 2). \n\nThere was evidence of genetic differentiation among populations. The \n\nestimated G\u201dST was significant when M was compared with the other subpopulations. \n\nThe estimated G\u201dST between P and M was 0.73, while between J and M G\u201dST = 0.79. \n\nNo significant differentiation was observed between the P and J populations (G\u201dST = \n\n0.46). \n\nAccording to the AMOVA (Table 4), the variation was highest within the \n\nsubpopulations, accounting for 70.7% of the total variance, but there was moderate \n\npercentage of variance among subpopulations (29.3%). Considering the total \n\npopulation, the level of differentiation was high (? = 0.2?2, P = 0.001), indicating that \n\nthere are significant differences among the populations studied. \n\nAnother set of analysis was conducted to try to find clusters without any \n\nprevious information other than the MLG data. A PCA was conducted and two clusters \n\nwere identified (Figure 3). Cluster 1 was comprised of isolates from Manaus, Manicor\u00e9, \n\nRio Preto da Eva and Beruri. While cluster 2 was composed of individuals from Bujari, \n\nXapuri, Eirunep\u00e9, Boca do Acre, Rio Branco, Rodrigues Alves and M\u00e2ncio Lima. \n\nDAPC was performed by grouping the populations with the first 30 major \n\ncomponents. The first discriminant axis separated the M isolates from the other \n\nindividuals. Two clusters were defined according to the analysis: one with isolates \n\nfrom the Madeira river and the other with isolates from the Juru\u00e1 and Purus rivers \n\n(Figure 4). \n\n \nDiscussion \n\n \n\nThe P. ulei populations of the Amazon region studied in the present work are \n\nstructured, which can be explained by the moderate level of percentage variance found \n\nbetween samples. Structured populations were also found to different populations of \n\nP. ulei from the Brazilian coast (Hora J\u00fanior, 2012) and in groups from Ecuador, \n\n\n\n \n \n\n39 \n \n\nGuatemala and French Guiana (Barr\u00e8s et al., 2012). However, the structuring of the \n\npopulation in these areas were somewhat expected because isolates were sampled from \n\ncommercial plantations. In the present study, samples came from reminiscent trees of \n\nold and abandoned plantations. Thus, no resistant clones were planted and isolates \n\nrecovered could have originated from native trees in the forest.  \n\nThe high differentiation between the individuals of Madeira in relation to those \n\nfrom the Purus and Juru\u00e1 rivers, the latter being more closely related, may indicate a \n\nstructuring according to the Amazon river watersheds, as observed for their host. The \n\npopulations of rubber trees formed three clusters of populations, one within the \n\nwatersheds of the Purus and Juru\u00e1 rivers in the Acre-Madre de Dios cluster (Peru), the \n\nother in the Madeira river watershed for the population of the state of Rond\u00f4nia \n\n(Brazil) and the last one in the watersheds of the Tapaj\u00f3s river for populations of the \n\nstate of Mato Grosso (Brazil). The genetic differentiation found for the pathogen \n\npopulation can be explained by the geographic distance, an important parameter of \n\ndifferentiation between populations that consequently results in the isolation by \n\ndistance of the populations (Le Guen et al., 2009). \n\nPrincipal component analysis indicates that Purus and Juru\u00e1 constitute a single \n\ncluster. The close relationship observed between these populations may be the result of \n\nthe occurrence of gene flow between these subpopulation. It seems that in the \n\npopulations of Juru\u00e1 and Purus there is migration effect due to the mixture of \n\ngenotypes found, despite geographic separation of the watersheds. These observations \n\ndiffer from the populations of P. ulei in Brazil (Bahia, Rond\u00f4nia and Mato Grosso), \n\nEcuador, Guatemala and French Guiana, in which it was demonstrated that there was \n\nno   gene flow (Barr\u00e8s et al., 2012). However, there is evidence for gene flow from the \n\nAcre population to the areas in the East coast in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and Esp\u00edrito \n\nSanto) (Hora J\u00fanior, 2012). Similar process can occur between Juru\u00e1 and Purus.  \n\nThe lack of continuous cultivation in the Amazon region may have contributed \n\nto the structuring of the populations and probably the mixture of Purus and Juru\u00e1 \n\ngenotypes was due to long distance dispersion, which may result from passive \n\ntransport by wind. Passive air transport has been reported for Puccinia melanocephala \n\nin sugarcane (Purdy et al., 1985), Melampsora larici-populina in poplar (Barr\u00e9s et al., \n\n2008) and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici on wheat (Wang et al., 2010). However, the \n\nspread of P. ulei by wind is less likely considering the formation of two genetic groups \n\n\n\n \n \n\n40 \n \n\nin the Amazon region, certainly influenced by the degree of isolation by distance, \n\nsuggesting a gradual dispersion (Barr\u00e8s et al., 2008). Based on geographical distance, \n\nthe dissemination may have occurred naturally through wild trees in the Amazon \n\nrainforest or by human-mediated transport of infected leaves in stumps or sprouts \n\n(Holliday, 1970; Chee and Holliday, 1986).  \n\nThe structuring of populations supports the idea that conidia play a key role in \n\nSALB epidemics in the center of origin of both the host and the pathogen. Conidia \n\nwere considered responsible for the infection for many years and the participation of \n\nascospores in the cycle, generally found in small numbers, was only observed in 1945 \n\n(Langford, 1945). These results do not corroborate with studies of populations located \n\nin different regions of Brazil, which presented predominant sexual reproduction (Hora \n\nJ\u00fanior, 2012). A more intensive sampling is required to properly address this issue.  \n\nA high genotypic diversity was detected in all populations. Similar results were \n\nobserved for populations of the Atlantic Coast and other populations of the Amazon \n\nregion sampled in commercial plantations a few years ago (Hora J\u00fanior, 2012). The \n\nhigh genetic variability of the pathogen population may explain the successive and \n\ndevastating infections caused by P. ulei when the Ford Motor Company attempted to \n\nestablish rubber plantations in the state of Par\u00e1 using high- performance Fx clones \n\n(Medeiros and Bahia, 1971). In addition, according to studies of physiological factors \n\nand of variability in large and small scales, the presence of the pathogen in all the rubber \n\nproducing areas of the region probably favors the adaptation of the pathogen to \n\ndifferent biophysical environments and may increase the severity of the epidemics \n\n(Junqueira et al., 1986; Mattos et al., 2003). The lack of durability of qualitative \n\nresistance of Hevea to P. ulei clones is explained by the presence of high genotypic \n\nvariability of the fungi (Chee and Wastie, 1980; Ploetz, 2007; Le Guen et al., 2007). \n\nAdditionally, the existence of genetically distinct populations implies that clone \n\nassessments for resistance level must consider different pathogen genotypes. \n\nConsidering the results of the present study, resistant clones should be tested in areas \n\nlocated in the Madeira watershed and in another location between the Juru\u00e1 and Purus \n\nrivers. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n41 \n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\n \nWe thank Embrapa Acre (Daniel Lambertucci) for technical and logistic \n\nsupport during sampling; Ana Ferreira and Braz Hora J\u00fanior for collecting and isolatin   \n\nfungal strains, CNPq for funding and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher \n\nEducation Personnel - CAPES, for granting the scholarship. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n42 \n \n\nReferences \n\nAgapow, P.
