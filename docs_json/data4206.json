Biofuels are an alternative for fossil fuels, being the most important today the biodiesel and bioethanol. Bioethanol is produced from many renewable sources, such as sugar cane, sugar beet, corn, wheat and wood, which contain high percentages of sugars. These sugars can be easily converted to ethanol by fermentation. To recover the ethanol from fermentation broths, several techniques can be used, such as distillation, adsorption, liquid-liquid extraction, among others. In this work, the phase equilibria in liquid-liquid extraction was studied. Liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) tie-lines were measured for two systems, castor oil -water-ethanol and methyl laurate-water-ethanol. Biodiesel is produced from vegetable oils and animals fats, through transesterification with lower alcohols. In this reaction vegetable oils and/or animal fats react with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst, to give the corresponding alkyl esters. The knowledge about the phase equilibria of systems containing an alcohol and a fatty acid ester is thus necessary to correctly design and develop biodiesel production and purification processes. The vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) for fatty acid methyl esters + alcohols systems was measured with an ebuliometer, as information about this kind of data was surprisingly scarce in the literature. The CPA (Cubic-Plus-Association) Equation of State was successfully applied to model the new experimental VLE data.\nContents\nList of tables......................................................................VIII\nList of figures.......................................................................IX\nList of symbols.......................................................................XI\nPart I.

I. Introduction\nSince the beginning of humanity, energy is the driving force of development, which became more pronounced from the Industrial Revolution onwards. Nowadays the energy is one of the most important factors in the development of countries.\nEnergy can be divided in two types, primary and secondary energy. Primary energy is the energy that exists in natural form and can generate energy in a direct way, such as oil, coal, natural gas, wind, water in dams, solar energy and geothermal energy. This can be classified into renewable and non-renewable energy. The secondary energy is obtained from the transformation of primary energy, such as electricity, gasoline, diesel, among others[1].\nThe demand of global primary energy is estimated to increase by 52% from 2003 to 2030, reaching 16.3 billion tonnes of oil equivalent (toe). Although fossil fuels are non renewable sources of energy, they will continue to be used as main sources of primary energy. The use of other renewable energy sources will increase progressively, but remains at low levels compared to the demand of oil [2, 3].\nFigure 1 World primary energy demand by fuel [2].\nOil will remain the most used source of primary energy, due to its clear advantages and qualities regarding, extractability, transportability, versatility, and cost.

Biofuels\nWith the increase of the oil price and its excessive consumption, the depletion of oil resources and the evident climate change derived from the excessive use of fossil fuels, the development of alternative fuels based on renewable energy sources became necessary [4, 5].\nIn the short term, biofuels produced from renewable raw materials, are the only alternative energy source that can effectively replace the oil-based fuels in many applications.\nBiofuels are renewable fuels, biodegradable, nontoxic and essentially free of sulphur and aromatics, and are produced from organic matter such as biomass. They can be solid, liquid or gaseous [6, 7].\nThere are a variety of biofuels potentially available, such as bioethanol, biomethanol, biogas, bio-syngas, biodiesel, biohydrogen, but the main biofuels being considered globally are biodiesel and bioethanol [8].\nsectors. As blends or by themselves, biofuels can help to reduce substantially both oil imports and carbon emissions to the atmosphere.\nThe production of these biofuels has increased in recent years, and projections indicate that growth is expected to continue over time, as is shown on figure 2.\nFigure 2 Trend in world biofuel production [9].\nBiodiesel is produced mainly in the Europe Union, principally Germany, while bioethanol is produced and consumed mainly in Brazil and North America. However, other countries, also started to increase their production of biofuels [10].\nBiodiesel and bioethanol can be produced from many raw materials (Figure 3). Bioethanol can be produced from a number of crops, including sugar beet, maize, wheat, potatoes, etc. Biodiesel can be produced from vegetable oils, animal fats, recycled waste vegetable oils, among others [8, 11].\nFigure 3 Some raw materials for bioethanol and biodiesel [11].\n1.1\tBioethanol\n1.1.1\tBioethanol production\nBioethanol is a fuel produced from many renewable feedstock sources, usually plants, such as sugar cane, sugar beet, maize (corn), wheat, and wood. These feedstock sources can be divided into sugary, starchy and lignocellulosic [6, 8, 12].\n\u2022 Sugary feedstock [6, 8, 12]\nSugar beet, sugarcane and sweet sorghum are the main sugar feedstocks to\nproduce ethanol, since these sources contain high percents of sugars.\nRaw materials containing sugars can be transformed into glucose. Glucose can then be converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide, under anaerobic conditions, with the chemical reaction of this conversion is being described below:\nC6HnO6\t2C2H5OH + 2CO2\t(1)\nFungi, bacteria, and yeast can be used for the fermentation process, however, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most used yeast.\nSugarcane is the most significant crop for production of bioethanol.\n\u2022\tStarchy feedstock [6, 8, 12]\nCorn, wheat, potatoes, barley, rice and sorghum grains are the main feedstocks containing starch.\nTo convert starch in to ethanol, the polymer of a-glucose is converted into glucose, through an enzymatic hydrolysis reaction. This reaction is followed by a fermentation to yield ethanol.\nCorn is the dominant feedstock in industry that converts starch to ethanol, since it is composed of about 60-70% of starch.\n\u2022\tLignocellulosic feedstock [6, 8, 12]\nLignocellulosic materials are the most abundant sources of carbohydrates in the Earth, and are mainly composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. Agricultural wastes, forest residues, municipal solid wastes and wastes from pulp/paper production are the most important lignocellulosic feedstocks that can be used to produce ethanol.\nSeveral studies have been developed for processing lignocellulosics to obtain ethanol. Although, these are not yet applicable in large scale, since the processing of these feedstocks is highly complex.\nIn 2017, it is estimated that the production of ethanol will increase more than twice when compared to 2007, where 127 billion litres will be produced compared with 62 billion litres in 2007 [13].\nBillion litres\tUSVIitre\n150-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------0.6\nProduction\nTrade\nPrices\nFigure 4 World bioethanol production, trade and prices, with projections to 2017.[13]\nThe selection of the most appropriate feedstock for ethanol production depends on the local conditions. The major problems in bioethanol production are the availability of feedstocks and their prices. In Brazil and in most tropical countries, sugar cane is the most common feedstock for ethanol production while in Europe, sugar beet and starchy materials are the most used feedstocks [14].\n1.1.2\tEthanol recovery\nEthanol produced by fermentation results in a solution of ethanol in water. For ethanol to be used as a fuel, it must first be separated from water [15, 16].\nDistillation is the method most used for this separation, although requiring considerable energy. This method in spite of having many advantages, has the disadvantage that ethanol purity is limited to 95-96 % due to the formation of a water-ethanol azeotrope [17].\nLiquid-liquid extraction (LLE) is a separation process that is used to separate liquid mixtures into their components, with low energy requirement. This process can be used to separate ethanol and water mixtures with a solvent, for example, purifying the products of a fermentation process [17].\nThere are some requisites to ensure that the extraction of ethanol-water with a solvent is a viable process, such as, high separation factor for ethanol (solvent extract preferentially ethanol than water), high selectivity for ethanol over water, low solvent solubility in the water-rich phase in to reduce the solvent losses, high capacity for ethanol to minimize the use of solvent, difference in densities between the two phases (organic and aqueous) to allow the rapid phase separation, chemical stability and effective means to recover ethanol from the solvent and recycle the solvent[ 18-20].\nThe equilibrium distribution coefficient, KD, is the ratio of the weight fraction of ethanol or water in the organic phase to that in the aqueous phase (at equilibrium) and describes the high separation factor for ethanol [19].\nkde -\nwE (op) wE (ap)\n(2)\nThe separation factor, a, is the ratio of the distribution coefficient of ethanol to that of water and describes the high selectivity for ethanol over water [19].\na \u2014\nkde kdw\n(3)\nSeveral solvents have been used to separate ethanol from water, and in previous works [21], it was found that ketones, alcohols and esters are the more suitable solvents to perform this extraction.\nCastor oil and methyl laurate are possible solvents which will be studied furtherin this thesis.\nThe liquid-liquid equilibrium data are usually represented in a graph called ternary diagram. These graphs represent isotherms at a sufficient pressure to maintain the system entirely liquid. The use of these diagrams shows the phase relations in ternary liquid systems.\nThe compositions of these systems may be expressed in weight fraction or molar fraction. Figure 5 represents a ternary diagram of components A, B and C, at a given temperature T and pressure P.\nThe components (B) and (A) and (A) and (C) are completely miscible with each other, but the components (B) and (C) are only partially miscible. The saturation curve (FRPEG) separates the biphasic region from the monophasic region. The line RE is called tie-line, and represents two phases in equilibrium, resulting from an overall composition K.\n1.2\tBiodiesel\nConversion of the vegetable oils into biodiesel has many advantages, such as, the reduction in viscosity over vegetable oils, direct used in modern diesel engines with little or no modification and possibility of mixing with petroleum diesel fuel in any ratio. Other advantages of biodiesel are the reduction in the emissions of sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons [23]\n1.2.1\tBiodiesel production\nblending, microemulsification, pyrolysis and transesterification. The most used method is\nthe transesterification reaction [24, 25].\nTriglyceride\nO\nCH2-O-C-R1\nI\nI\tO\nCH - O - C - R2 -\nI\nI\tO\nCH2-O-C-R3\nMetliauol\tMethyl Esters\tGlycerol\nO\nI\nCHa - O - C - Ri\nO\tCH ' - OH\nII I\n3 CHaOH -> CHa - O - C - R2 + CH - OH (Catalyst)\t|\no cm - oh\nCHa - O - C - Ra\nFigure 6 Transesterification reaction [26].\nR1, R2, and R3 are long alkyl chains, also called fatty acid chains.\nThrough the transesterification reaction, vegetable oils and animal fats react with an alcohol, in the presence of a catalyst, to give the corresponding alkyl esters and glycerol. Methanol and ethanol are the most commonly used alcohols, however, methanol is preferred choice due its low cost and its physical and chemical advantages. In this reaction some types of catalysts can be employed, such as, acid, base or enzyme materials. Usually, an alkaline catalyst (sodium or potassium hydroxide) is used because the reaction is much faster than using an acid catalyst [25].\nGiven the reversible nature of the reaction, it is necessary to use one of the reagents in excess (alcohol) to encourage the displacement of equilibrium towards the products.\nAt the end of the transesterification reaction, a mixture of FAME and glycerol is obtained, however, these products have a considerable amount of excess methanol. The excess alcohol is frequently removed with a flash evaporation process or by distillation [6].\nThe approximate percentage proportions of this reaction are presented in the table\nbelow:\nTable 2 Biodiesel production input and output levels [28].\nProcess Input Levels\t\tProcess Ouput Levels\t\nInput\tVolume Percentage (%)\tOutput\tVolume Percentage (%)\nOil or Fat\t87\tEsther\t86\nAlcohol\t12\tAlcohol\t4\nCatalyst\t\tFertilizer\t1\n\t1\tGlycerol\t9\nFigure 7 shows the world biodiesel production and the projections for 2017. The\nproduction of biodiesel will grow faster than that of bioethanol, although at considerably\nlower level [13].\nFigure 7 World biodiesel production, trade and prices, with projections to 2017 [13].\n1.2.2\tBiodiesel production and purification process\nA simplified diagram for biodiesel production is shown in figure 8 and can be divided into various steps [29, 30]:\n- Mixing of alcohol and catalyst: in this step the alcohol and the catalyst will be mixed, to dissolve this in the alcohol phase.\n-\tTransesterification reaction: vegetable oils or animal fats are added to the previous mixture and the reaction takes place in the reactor. In Smaller plants, usually use batch reactors, but bigger plants (more than 4 million liters/year) use continuous flow processes.\n-\tSeparation of products: after the reaction, methyl esters and glycerol must be separated. Since glycerol is only slightly soluble in esters, this is a rapid process and can be perform in a centrifuge. Sometimes the products of the reaction need to be neutralized, which also occurs in this step.\n-\tAlcohol Recovery: since each of the phases previously separated contains a large excess of alcohol used in the reaction, it is necessary to recover this alcohol. Two processes can be used to accomplish this separation, flash evaporation or distillation. However, distillation is the most used. The alcohol recovered is re-used in the process.\n-\tMethyl Ester wash: following the alcohol has recovery, esters, they may suffer a process of water washing if necessary, to remove any residual catalyst, soaps, salts, methanol, or free glycerol. After this step, any remaining water is removed from the methyl esters by a vacuum flash process.\n-\tGlycerol neutralization: the residual catalyst and the soaps presents in the glycerolrich phase are neutralized with an acid. Sometimes the salts formed in this step are recovered for use as fertilizer, but in most of the cases the salts are left in the glycerol phase.\nFigure 8 Diagram of biodiesel production process [29].\nThe knowledge of the phase equilibria of alcohol + FAME systems is thus required to design and develop the step where this separation occurs in the biodiesel production process [31, 32], and this subject will be studied on this work.\n2. Model\nMulti-component phase equilibria can be described using the excess Gibbs energy models (GE), generally for low-pressure applications, and equations of state (EoS), usually for high-pressure applications.\nThe CPA (Cubic Plus Association) is an equation of state, that combines the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equation of state with the association term of the Wertheim theory [33, 34]. In this equation of state the physical interactions between the molecules are described by the SRK equation, and the association term accounts for the specific site-site interactions due to hydrogen bonding and solvation effects.\nSince the CPA model takes into account the interactions that can be found in mixtures of associating compounds, that makes it applicable to describe multiphase equilibria for systems containing associating components. [35]\nThe mixtures of water or ester and alcohols or glycerol are mixtures composed by associating components, and knowledge about the phase equilibria of these mixtures is important for the processes of production and purification of biofuels.\nCPA has already been applied successfully to the modeling of the vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) of alcohol-hydrocarbon [36] and glycol-water systems [37], the liquidliquid equilibria (LLE) of alcohol-hydrocarbon [38], glycol-hydrocarbon [39], water-fluorocarbons [40] and water-hydrocarbon mixtures [41], VLE and LLE for ternary mixtures containing water, alcohols and alkanes [42], VLE for glycerol systems [43] and recently was also applied to describe the solid-liquid equilibria (SLE) of glycol/methanol-water systems [35].\nThe CPA EoS can be expressed in terms of compressibility factor as:\n(4)\nwhere a is the energy parameter, b the co-volume, p is the molar density, g a\nsimplified radial distribution function, xt the mole fraction of the component i and XAi the mole fraction of pure i not bonded at site A [41].\nXAi is related to the association strength, AAiBj, between two sites on different molecules, site A on molecule i and site B on molecule J and is calculated by solving the\nfollowing set of equations:\n1\nXj' 1 + p\u00a3 Xj \u00a3 XbPAB\nJ\tBJ\n(5)\nThe association strength AAiBj is given by:\nAABj\n= g (Pp\n\tLAB\t\nexp\t\t-1\n\tRT\t\n\t\t\nby i'>\t''\n(6)\nWhere e\u2018ABj\nis the pure component association energy, and ft'\"'' the pure component\nassociation volume.\nThe simplified radial distribution function, g(p), is given by:\ng (P) =\n1\n1 -1.9^\nwhere n =1 bp .\n4\n(7)\nThe energy parameter, a, for pure parameters is given by a Soave-type temperature\ndependency:\na = ao [1 + c1 (1 -JTr\n(8)\nwhere Tr is the reduced temperature (T/Tc).\nFor non-associating components CPA has three pure component parameters (a0, c and b) while for associating components it has five (a0, cj, b, p, s). In both cases, these parameters are regressed simultaneously from pure component experimental data\nThe regression of the pure-compounds parameters is done using selected vapor pressure and liquid density data with the following objective function:\nOF =\u00a3\nNP ( Jjexp. _ pcalc.\np, exp.\n,2 NP (\n'E (\npexP. _ pcalc.\npB\n(9)\ni k\nWhen CPA EoS is applied to mixtures, the energy and the co-volume parameters of the physical term are calculated using the conventional van der Waals one-fluid rules:\na =\txlx]al] ,\twhere ay =7^(1 _ky)\ni y\nb = 2xibi \u2022\ni\n(10)\n(11)\nkyy a binary interaction parameter, and is estimated from equilibrium data by the\nobjective function:\nA 2\nJ\nNP\nOF=E\ni\nrrr calc.\trri e~xp.\nT i  T i\nexp.\n(12)\n\nCombining rules for the association energy and volume parameters are required for extending the CPA equation of state to mixtures containing cross-associating molecules.\nSome authors [44-46] proposed different sets of combining rules for sab , fiAB and tiAB :\npABt &lt;,.4B\nAB S + S s y =------------\n2\naAiBi\n\u25a0 _ V__________\n+ VAB\n2\n, (13) which are referred as CR-1 set\npAtf ,\tAyBy\nAiBy _ S\t+S\tR4B\nS = 2 \u2019 V\n= JpAB VAyB\n(14) which are referred as CR-2 set\nV\n5\n= y[VA^BVB,\nS ' S4B ' 4y , VA-By\na4b = JaAb aAb\n(15) which are referred as CR-3 set\n(16) which are referred as CR-4 set (or Elliot rule)\n\u2022 Association scheme\nThe association scheme is related to the number and type of association sites for the associating compounds. There are many schemes based on the terminology of Huang and Radosz [47], which can been seen in the next table.\nTable 3 Association schemes [33, 47]\nSpecies\tFormula\tType\tSite fractions (X)\t\n\ta\t1A\tXi\tII\nAcids\tr i / \\o /\t\t\t\n\tA \tO:b\t3B\tXa\t= XB; XC = 2Xa -1\n\tH c\t\tXi\t= XAXBXC\nAlcohol\t\u2014o-y\t\t\t\n\tH B\t2B\tXa\t= XB\n\t\t\tXi\t= XAXB\nGlycol\tH\tB\t4C\tXa Xi\t= XB = XC = XD = XAXBXCXD\n\tA b:O:Hc\t4C\tXa\t= XB = XC = XD\n\tH D\t\tXi\t= XAXBXCXD\n\ta\t3B\tXa\t= XB; XC = 2Xa -1\nWater\t\t\t\t\n\tH B\t\tXi\t= XAXBXC\n\tA\t\tXa\t= XB; XC = 2Xa -1\n\te: q\u00bf\"h?\t3B\t\t\n\t\t\tXi\t= XAXBXC\nSince CPA EoS is applied to mixtures containing cross-association molecules, it is necessary the use of combining rules for the association energy and volume parameters [41, 42]. In the case of ester + self associating compound systems, cross-association occurs even if the ester is not a self-associating molecule.\nIn this work, the cross-association energy parameter (_AB{ ) is obtained dividing by two the energy of the associating compound (this basically means that the crossassociation energy can be obtained from an arithmetic combining rule where the s value for the ester is zero). The cross association volume is considered as an adjustable parameter, fitted to equilibrium data.\nAssociating\n_AiBi __\t(17)\tpABi (fitted)\nThe approach followed here for the cross-association energy parameter has been successfully applied to other mixtures, such as water-aromatics or olefinics [41] and water-esters [48].\nThe association term depends on the number and type of association sites. For alcohols the two-site (2B) or three-site (3B) association scheme can be adopted. However, the two-site (2B) association scheme will be here used, since, both having been tested, that was the one that gave a better description of the systems [34, 47]. For the ester family a single association site is considered, cross-associating with the alcohol.\nTable 4 Types of bonding in associating fluids [33, 47].\nSpecie\tFormula\tRigorous type\tAssigned type\nAlcohol\tA \u2014 0* chB\t3B\t2B\nEster\t+ + :o:\t1\t1\nPart II. Experimental\n1. Liquid-liquid equilibria\n1.1\tMaterials\nThe chemicals used to prepare de samples were castor oil, ethanol absolute and methyl laurate. Castor oil was supplied by Jos\u00e9 M. Vaz Pereira, SA, ethanol absolute was supplied by Riedel-de Haen with a purity of 99,8% and methyl laurate was supplied by Aldrich with a purity of 98%.\n1.2\tExperimental procedure\nTernary mixtures were prepared with compositions within the two phase region, with different amounts of water, ethanol and methyl laurate / castor oil.\nEach of these samples was stirred vigorously and left to stand for 15 days in a stove at 293 K in order to achieve a good separation of phases.\nFigure 9 Biphasic sample.\nThe method used to determine the quantity of water in each of the saturated phases was the Karl Fischer coulometry. For that purpose, a Metrohm 831 Karl Fischer Coulometer was employed.\nFigure 10 Metrohm 831 Karl Fischer Coulometer.\nA fixed amount of sample is added to the solution of hydranal, and it is titrated.\nTo determine the quantity of methyl ester / castor oil in samples a vacuum line as shown on figure 11, is used, where all the water and ethanol are removed from the sample, so that the final content of the sample is only methyl ester / castor oil.\nFigure 11 Vacuum line.\n2.

The ebuliometer is composed of a boiling still with a port for liquid sampling/injection and a condenser.\nThe temperature control is done using a thermostatic bath. The pressure was kept constant trough a vacuum line with a calibrated Baratron Heated Capacitance Manometer 728A MKS, with an accuracy of 0.50%. The total volume of the still was about 50 ml, of which about 30 ml was occupied by the liquid solution.\nIn the measurements a liquid solution rich in FAME was introduced into the boiling still and heated to its boiling point while mixing with a magnetic stirrer. The temperature was measured using a calibrated Pt100 temperature sensor with an uncertainty of 0.05 K, and the liquid phase sampled and its composition measured.\nSubsequently fixed amounts of alcohol were introduced into the ebuliometer to change the mixture composition and the procedure repeated.\nRefractive index measurements were used for analyzing the composition of the binary liquid mixtures in the boiling still, using an Abbe type refractometer, (Figure 13), with an uncertainty of 1H0'4\nFigure 13 Abbe refractometer.\nTo perform the calibration curve of each system FAME + alcohol, were prepared samples with different amounts of FAME and read up the refractive indexes.\nRefractive index shows a polynomial trend with the FAME weigh fraction, and using the correlation presented in figures showed at the Appendix sections A and B, it is possible to obtain the composition of the sample removed from the ebuliometer.\nPart III. Results and discussion\n1. Liquid-liquid equilibria\nTie lines were measured for castor oil + ethanol + water and methyl laurate + ethanol + water systems at 303K. The binodal curves (green and blue points) for these systems were already determined in another work [49]. Liquid-liquid equilibria diagrams containing binodal curves and tie lines are presented in figures below.\nEthanol\nWater 0,0\t0,1\t0,2\t0,3\t0,4\t0,5\t0,6\t0,7\t0,8\t0,9\t1,0 Castor oil\nFigure 14 Ternary diagram of castor oil + ethanol + water system in weight fraction.\nEthanol\nFigure 15 Ternary diagram of methyl laurate + ethanol + water system in weight fraction.\nAnalyzing the binodal curve of the two systems, we can see that the system water + methyl laurate + ethanol has a higher solubility because its heterogeneous region is smaller than in the ternary castor oil + ethanol + water.\nThe experimental tie lines data of the systems investigated are reported in the next tables.\nTable 6 Tie line data for castor oil(S) + ethanol(E) + water(W) system (weight fraction).\nCastor oil Rich Phase\t\t\tEthanol/Water Rich Phase\t\t\tDistribution coefficients\t\tSeparation factor\nWs\twe\tWw\tws\twe\tWw\tKDw\tKde\ta\n0,629\t0,323\t0,048\t0,046\t0,742\t0,212\t0,228\t0,435\t1,908\n0,659\t0,295\t0,046\t0,007\t0,722\t0,271\t0,169\t0,409\t2,423\n0,707\t0,258\t0,035\t0,004\t0,650\t0,346\t0,102\t0,397\t3,883\n0,797\t0,170\t0,033\t0,001\t0,583\t0,416\t0,079\t0,292\t3,676\nTable 7 Tie line data for methyl laurate(S) + ethanol(E) + water(W) (weight fraction).\nMethyl Laurate Rich Phase\t\t\tEthanol/Water Rich Phase\t\t\tDistribution coefficients\t\tSeparation factor\nWS\tWE\tWW\tWS\tWE\tWW\tKDw\tKde\ta\n0,792\t0,176\t0,032\t0,060\t0,589\t0,351\t0,091\t0,299\t3,278\n0,853\t0,128\t0,019\t0,028\t0,544\t0,428\t0,044\t0,235\t5,300\n0,905\t0,083\t0,012\t0,003\t0,489\t0,508\t0,024\t0,170\t7,185\n0,916\t0,072\t0,012\t0,002\t0,463\t0,535\t0,022\t0,156\t6,933\n0,955\t0,026\t0,019\t0,000\t0,313\t0,687\t0,028\t0,083\t3,004\nAlthough the tie lines are not favourable, the differential miscibility of ethanol in oil and FAME and water could be exploited to separate ethanol from water.\nAnalyzing the experimental tie-line data, there is a low water content in the FAME/oil rich phase (organic phase) and low content of FAME/oil in the ethanol rich phase (aqueous phase). This is important in order to successfully separate ethanol from water.\nAs the separation factor is greater than 1, this means that the FAME and oil preferably extracts ethanol than water.\nHowever, the low values of distribution coefficients and the separation factor, indicates that the castor oil and methyl laurate are not as good solvents for the separation as expected. Since, to be good solvents the value of a and KDE should be higher.\n2.

These parameters were estimated in previous works [48, 50], achieving a good description of vapor pressure and liquid densities with CPA EoS for the studied compound, with an average deviation inferior to 1% for the alcohols and 5% for the FAMEs.\nTable 8 CPA Pure-compound parameters and modeling results\nCompound\tao (J.m3.mol-2)\tC1\tb x 104 (m3.mol')\tP x 102\t\u00a3 (J.mol-1)\tAAD (%)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tP\u00b0\tP\nMethanol\t0,43268\t0,74696\t0,32151\t3,4096\t20859\t0,29\t0,14\nEthanol\t0,68415\t0,93923\t0,47508\t1,9212\t21336\t0,35\t0,51\nMethyl laurate\t7,4563\t1,3712\t2,4041\t\t\t0,80\t1,31\nMethyl myristate\t8,8395\t1,5074\t2,7951\t\t\t3,66\t\nMethyl Oleate\t10,6962\t1,8649\t3,3387\t\t\t4,81\t1,74\nTo calculate the average absolute deviation (AAD %) the following formula was used:\nI NP % AAD =\tY ABS\texp.- calc.i\tX o o v\nNP*-f f\t1=1\t_\texp.i\t_\t7\n(17)\nThe fitting of the binary interaction parameter ktj (Eq 9) is required, in order to achieve a good vapor liquid equilibria description. During the modeling of the experimental data, the fa parameter tended to a constant value: 0,10 for ethanol-FAME and 0,13 for methanol-FAME systems, with the larger value for the methanol + fame systems being explained by the stronger solvation effect of the shorter chain length alcohol. Fixing this parameter, ky will be calculated again and its value will be correlated with the ester chain length, making the model predictive for these type of systems.\nPhase equilibrium data and CPA pure parameters for other ester systems, such as those with ethyl metanoate [51], methyl butanoate [52], hexyl acetate, methyl acetate [53]. ethyl propionate [54] and ethyl butanoate [55] were available in the literature. They were used to estimate the parameter kij and to establish a trend for these parameters with the number of carbons of the ester compound.\nThe results of the regression of these binary interaction parameters are presented in the next tables and figures.\nTable 9 CPA binary interaction parameters for ethanol + ester systems\nPtj= 0,1\t\t\nCompound\tkij\tAAD %\nEthyl metanoate\t0,0254\t0,17\nMethyl butanoate\t0,0190\t0,15\nHexyl acetate\t0,0129\t0,53\nMethyl laurate\t-0,0002\t0,33\nMethyl myristate\t-0,0046\t0,11\nMethyl oleate\t-0,0197\t0,34\nFigure 23 kij trend with the ester carbon number for ethanol + ester systems.\nTable 10 CPA binary interaction parameters for methanol + ester systems\nPtj=0,13\t\t\nCompound\tkij\tAAD%\nEthyl propionate\t-0,0019\t0,15\nMethyl acetate\t0,0072\t0,03\nHexyl acetate\t-0,0137\t0,41\nEthyl butanoate\t-0,0058\t0,54\nMethyl laurate\t-0,0326\t0,27\nMethyl meristate\t-0,0432\t0,39\nMethyl oleate\t-0,0589\t0,41\nFigure 24 kij trend with the ester carbon number for methanol + ester systems\nComparing figures 23 and 24, it clear that the kj s shows a linear trend with the number of carbons in the ester chain. So, using the correlations presented in the figures and the Pij values presented before, the use of the CPA equation of state to describe these VLE can be performed in a totally predictive way.\nIn the following figures the CPA results are presented for the different studied systems.\n\u2022 Ethanol + methyl ester systems\nTemperature (K)\tTemperature (K)\nIn the figures below, the experimental data are described by the CPA EoS.\nFigure 25 VLE for ethanol + methyl laurate system with kiJ=-0,0002.\nFigure 26 VLE for ethanol + methyl myristate system with kj\u20140,0046.\nFigure 27 VLE for ethanol + methyl oleate system with kj\u20140,0197.\nIn this work, a two-site (2B) association scheme was adopted for alcohols. For the ester family a single association site is considered, cross-associating with the alcohol.\nWith the kij.and fa parameters obtained before, the vapor-liquid equilibria was correctly estimated by the CPA equation of state.\nComparing the figures, is appears that the CPA equation of state provides very good results for the three ethanol + FAME systems, especially for ester compositions smaller than 0,8.\n\u2022 Methanol + methyl ester systems\nIn the next figures, the experimental data are described by the CPA EoS\nTemperature (K)\n540\n510\n480\n450\n420\n390\n360\n330\n0,0\t0,1\t0,2\t0,3\t0,4\t0,5\t0,6\t0,7\t0,8\t0,9\t1,0\nX methyl laurate\nFigure 28 VLE for methanol + methyl laurate system with kj=-0,0326.\nTemperature (K)\tTemperature (K)\nFigure 29 VLE for methanol + methyl myristate system with /&lt;-C),0432.\nX methyl oleate\nFigure 30 VLE for methanol + methyl oleate system with kj=-0,0589.\nThe results obtained from the CPA equation of state are again, as for the previous ethanol + FAME systems, in very good agreement with the experimental VLE, being only necessary a single, small and temperature independent binary interaction parameter, with these being dependent on the ester chain length.\nComparing the systems ethanol-FAME and methanol-FAME, they exhibit the same behaviour, differing only in temperature, which in the case of ethanol-FAME is higher.\nIt was important to measure the VLE for FAME + alcohols systems, since these kind of data was surprisingly scarce in the literature and the knowledge of these phase equilibria is an important step for designing and developing the biodiesel purification processes.\nOnce CPA EoS has been already applied successfully for other systems in biodiesel production and purification [43], it was a relevant fact that to confirm in this work that the application of this equation continues to be valid for describing other systems of importance for the biodiesel industry.\nPart IV. Conclusions\nThe production of biofuels has increased substantially over the years, with particular importance to biodiesel and bioethanol.\nBioethanol produced by fermentation, results in a solution of ethanol in water. This solution can be separated using various techniques. Liquid-liquid extraction is an alternative method and requires less energy to operate than conventional methods, such as distillation.\nIn this work the liquid-liquid equilibria for water-ethanol-methyl ester/ oil systems was studied, in order to evaluate which was the best solvent to carry out the separation of ethanol from water. Castor oil and methy laurate were evaluated for their ability for this separation. Although the obtained values for the separation factor are greater than 1, the distribution coefficients values are relatively low. This means that the castor oil and methyl laurate are not good solvents to perform an efficient separation.\nThe vapor-liquid equilibria for alcohols + FAMEs were measured at atmospheric pressure, since the knowledge of the phase equilibria is an important factor and is required to design and develop the biodiesel production and purification processes.\nThe CPA (Cubic-Plus-Association) equation of state was successfully applied to model the new VLE experimental data.\nThe two-site (2B) association scheme was adopted for alcohols in this work, while a single association site that interacts solely with other sites in a different associatin molecule was considered for esters. This was found to be a good option for systems alcohol + esters.\nA single, small, temperature independent and ester carbon number dependent binary interaction parameter was enough to obtain a very good description of the experimental VLE data. Correlations for obtaining the kiJ,s as a function of the ester chain length were proposed. A constant value for pij was also used, making this model totally predictive.\nPart V.
