So far, the social structure of these associations has been largely deduced \n\nfrom subjective assessments in the field or by counting the number of inter-specific encounters at the \n\nwhole-group level, without considering changes to individual pairwise interactions. Here, we look \n\nfor evidence of non-random association between pairs of bird species, delimit groups of more \n\nstrongly associated species and examine differences in social structure between old growth and \n\nsecondary forest habitat. We used records of bird species detection from mist-netting capture and \n\nfrom acoustic recordings to identify pairwise associations that were detected more frequently than \n\nexpected under a null distribution, and compared the strength of these associations between old-\n\ngrowth and secondary forest Amazonian tropical forest. We also used the pairwise strength \n\nassociations to visualize the social network structure and its changes between habitat types. We \n\nfound many strongly positive interactions between species, but no evidence of repulsion. Network \n\nanalyses revealed several modules of species that broadly agree with the subjective groupings \n\ndescribed in the ornithological literature. Furthermore, both network structure and association \n\nstrength changed drastically with habitat disturbance, with the formation of a few new associations \n\nbut a general trend towards the breaking of associations between species. Our results show that social \n\ngrouping in birds is real and may be strongly affected by habitat degradation, suggesting that the \n\nstability of the associations is threatened by anthropogenic disturbance.  \n\n \n\nKey words: Mixed-species flocks, tropical forest birds, inter-specific interaction, null models, \n\nnetworks, pairwise co-detection \n\n  \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\nTitulo \nEncontra interespec\u00edfica n\u00e3o aleat\u00f3ria entre aves de sub-bosque amaz\u00f4nico: qual elas s\u00e3o e como elas \n\nmudam?   \n\nResumo \nOs bandos mistos de aves s\u00e3o agrega\u00e7\u00f5es sociais complexas est\u00e1veis durante o tempo e espa\u00e7o.

Living in groups provides several benefits to individual participants \n\nsuch as reducing predation risk (e.g. Cresswell and Quinn 2004). However, being with conspecifics \n\nmay be costly, as it can increase resource competition and the risk of exposure to disease and \n\nparasites (e.g. Altizier et al 2003).  \n\nJoining mixed-species flocks would be an efficient strategy to reduce competition while keeping \n\nanti-predation benefits (Morse 1977, Sridhar et al 2009, Harrison and Whitehouse 2011).  These \n\ninterspecific groups are found in many taxa, including ungulates (Fitzgibbon 1990), primates \n\n(Terborgh 1990), fish (Allan and Pitcher 1986), and birds (Moynihan 1962). In tropical forests, there \n\nare two main interspecific associations among understory Amazonian birds, which are the mixed-\n\nspecies flocks and the ant-following birds (Bierregaard and Lovejoy 1989, Cohn-Haft et al 1997).  \n\nAnt following birds are aggregated at swarms of army-ants (e.g. Eciton burchelli) (Willis and Oniki \n\n1978). They are following the ants but do not feed on them. Instead, these birds are capturing prey \n\n(mainly arthropods) flushed by the flow of ants. Those ants are mainly active during the reproductive \n\nor \u2018nomadic\u2019 period (i.e. fourteen days in each 35 days, Schneirla 1971 in Willis and Oniki 1978), \n\nwhich will drive the presence of birds in an area (Willis and Oniki 1978). At swarms, we can find \n\nbirds with two different strategies. There are the species that are exclusively foraging over ant \n\nswarms, classified as \u201cprofessional\u201d, and the birds that will wait at the edges of the swarms and \n\noccasionally forage in the center, categorized as \u201cnon-professional\u201d (Oniki 1972, Oniki and Willis \n\n1972, Willis and Oniki 1978, Harper 1989, Willson 2004).  \n\nUnderstory mixed-species flocks are groups of insectivorous species that move and forage together \n\nall day long, and have the particularity to be stable throughout the year in tropical areas (Morse 1970, \n\nMartinez and Gomez 2013). The association between species results in higher foraging efficiency \n\nand  reduces predation, as well as increases their fitness (Beauchamps 2004). They consist of \n\nbreeding pairs of six to ten \u2018core\u2019 species (i.e. almost exclusively seen in flock), which have together \n\na foraging area that includes all their territories (Munn 1985, Jullien and Thiollay 1998). Among \n\nthose \u2018core\u2019 species, the Thamnomanes sp. are species that play the role of leader in the Amazon. \n\nTheir role consists of rallying the members of the flocks by emitting loud calls early each morning \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\nthat continue throughout the day in order to maintain the cohesion of the group during movements. \n\nThey also give alarm calls when they detect a potential predator, which provides benefits for other \n\nspecies that therefore can decrease their vigilance (Munn and Terborgh 1979, Powell 1985). \n\nMart\u00ednez and Zenil (2012) demonstrated the dependence on those warnings for the species that \n\nattend to flocks. Thamnomanes sp. take the opportunity, that those species will stop foraging after \n\nemission of an alarm call, to emit false warnings and benefit from the distraction effect to catch prey \n\nflushed by other birds (Powell 1985). Those behaviors show the different implications of the acoustic \n\ncommunication within the flock. During day, the \u2018core\u2019 species can be joined by up to 50 species, \n\nwith variation over time in species\u2019 flock attendance (Jullien and Thiollay 1998). Considering this \n\ndifference in \u2018attendance\u2019, flock species have been allocated to different categories from \u2018core\u2019 to \n\n\u2018occasional\u2019 species (see Munn and Terborgh 1979, Jullien and Thiollay 1998 for example of \n\nclassifications). These definitions highlight the complexity of studying mixed-species flocks in the \n\nfield and partly explained that many researchers have relied on an ultimately subjective decision like \n\ninclude an individual in the studied group or not.  \n\nTropical forests are subject to high degrees of habitat degradation, which affect the entire avifauna \n\n(Bierregaard and Lovejoy 1989). However, whilst the effects of disturbance on non-trophic and \n\nsocial interactions in birds are known to exist, they are not sufficiently studied so far at the entire \n\ngroup structure scale (Mokross et al 2014). \n\nOur first objective is to look for non-random associations within both mixed-species flocks and ant-\n\nfollowing birds in undisturbed tropical forests. We then want to be able to delimit sub-groups in old \n\ngrowth forest in order to test the validity of species\u2019 traditional categorizations from the \n\nornithological literature. The second objective is to use these results to compare with the associations \n\nand group structure in disturbed forest, and thus be able to highlight any breaking of associations that \n\nwould explain any changes to the group structure of these groups of bird species. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n6 \n \n\nNON-RANDOM INTER-SPECIFIC ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN \n\nAMAZON UNDERSTORY FOREST BIRDS: WHAT ARE THEY AND \n\nHOW DO THEY CHANGE? \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n \n\nLiving organisms are in constant interaction with their environment and with each other. Among \n\nthese interactions, group living is one of the features adopted across many animal taxa, including \n\nmammals, fish, and birds (Moynihan 1962, Allan and Pitcher 1986, Terborgh 1990). Groups are \n\nmost commonly composed of animals of one species, but there are many striking cases of inter-\n\nspecific association resulting either from the presence of a common resource or from a social \n\nbehavior that pulls animals from different species together (Morse 1970, Moriarty 1977, Powell \n\n1979). Inter-specific associations of a social nature may reduce competition between individuals \n\nwhile increasing foraging success and anti-predation effects (Harrison and Whitehouse 2011, Sridhar \n\net al 2009). As important as those ecological interactions may be, they are subject to environmental \n\nchange (Tylianakis et al 2008), and by human activity, mainly via habitat loss (Thiollay 1992, 1999a, \n\nStouffer and Bierregaard 1995, Maldonado-Coelho and Marini 2000, Van Houtan et al 2006, \n\nKnowlton and Graham 2011, Mokross et al 2014).  \n\nIn the Amazon tropical rainforests that are the setting of this study one can find two main types of \n\ninter-specific association between understory forest birds, the social-driven mixed-species flocks \n\n(Morse 1970) and the resource-driven army-ant-following flocks (Willis and Oniki 1978). Mixed-\n\nspecies flocks of birds are among the most complex multi-species association of foraging species, \n\npresent in diverse habitat around the world (Harrison and Whitehouse 2011). Historically, these \n\ninterspecific associations of birds have been delimited in two main approaches. The first is \n\nqualitative, and based on field observations done by experts with recognized authority in the field \n\n(e.g. Munn and Terborgh 1979, Cohn-Haft et al 1997, Willis and Oniki 1978). The second is \n\n\n\n7 \n \n\nquantitative and results from mathematical analysis of field observations (e.g. Moynihan 1962, \n\nJullien and Thiollay 1998). Since field observations are at the root of both approaches, it is important \n\nto consider two principal difficulties in identifying and following multi-species flocks in the field. \n\nFirst, it is very costly; researchers may spend several hundreds of hours following tens of flocks (e.g. \n\nMoynihan 1962, Mokross et al. 2014). Second, it is difficult to determine which bird is part of a \n\nflock due mostly to difficulty in delimiting the spatial and temporal extent of the observed \n\nassociation. While Moynihan (1962) considered tropical birds to be flocking when they were seen in \n\nthe same tree or bush, others include only species seen moving together throughout periods of 10, 15 \n\nor 30 minutes (Powell 1989, Jullien and Thiollay 1998, Mokross et al. 2014). Given the variety of \n\ntemporal and spatial criteria, it is easy to understand how they can influence perceptions of who \n\nassociates with whom. Indeed, in the Amazon, many species are rarely detected outside of inter-\n\nspecific associations, and the detection of mixed-species flocks is usually triggered by the presence \n\nof Thamnomanes spp. individuals (Munn and Terborgh 1979, Powell 1985). The subsequent step of \n\ncategorizing what species are more or less involved in the association is also problematic. These \n\ncategories usually result from a species-level calculation of flocking propensity, sometimes measured \n\nas the percentage of all sightings of species that occurred in flocks (Moynihan 1962, Jullien and \n\nThiollay 1998). Studies of the impact of habitat degradation on inter-specific associations usually \n\nallude to changes in the abundance and presence of flocking species (Thiollay 1997, Van Houtan et \n\nal 2006), but they also use measures of flocking propensity to assess changes from a quantitative \n\nperspective (Thiollay 1999b, Mokross et al 2014). The main drawback of propensity measures, \n\nhowever, is that they miss the opportunity to understanding associations at the pairwise level. That is, \n\nany re-structuring of inter-specific associations that results in a similar proportion of (unspecified) \n\ninterspecific encounters for each species will be missed by propensity metrics. \n\nSpecies interactions in general have for a long time been studied at the entire matrix (or set of \n\nspecies) level (Gotelli and McCabe 2002). The analysis of species co-occurrence on islands elicited \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nmuch academic debate through the years, starting with Jared Diamond\u2019s studies of bird species co-\n\noccurrence on islands in Southeast Asia (1973, 1975, reviewed in Gotelli and MacCabe 2002). \n\nDiamond\u2019s study focused largely on the assessment of diffuse competition; thus requiring the \n\nanalysis of co-occurrence patterns among multiple species within an assemblage. Such focus resulted \n\nin methods aimed at understanding patterns at the level of the entire assemblage regardless of the \n\nspecifics of interaction between any two particular pair of species. One important component of such \n\nmethods is the Null Model approach (synthesis of algorithms and metrics in Gotelli 2000) which \n\nhelp quantify the extent to each a particular observed pattern is different from what could be \n\nexpected from chance encounters of species that do not seek to interact with each other. Null models \n\nhave been applied to study possible patterns of co-occurrence in mixed-species bird flocks (Graves \n\nand Gotelli 1993) and in ant-following flocks of neotropical forest (Pizo and Melo 2010). More \n\nrecent applications suggest examining pairwise co-occurrence associations (Sfenthourakis et al 2006, \n\nVeech 2006, Gotelli and Ulrich 2010, Pitta et al 2012) with methods that could detect positive, \n\nnegative or random association between two species (Veech 2013, 2014).  \n\nA second, much used approach to understanding inter-specific interactions is the use of social \n\nnetwork analysis. Network analysis is still based on matrix-level information (Croft et al 2008, \n\nFarine and Whitehead 2015) and it helps one to visually identify social interaction based on a graph \n\nrepresenting species by nodes and biological interactions by edges (Wey et al 2008). These networks \n\nare ideal to understand the structural complexity of biological processes and types of interactions, \n\nsuch as mutualism (Guimar\u00e3es et al 2011). They are also helpful to assess the impact of habitat \n\ndisturbance (Tylianakis et al 2007, Mokross et al 2014) and climate change (Ara\u00fajo et al 2011) on \n\ninteractions. Different metrics are used to interpret the interactions represented in a network, with \n\nmodularity metrics, usually employed for delimiting subunits of a network (Girvan and Newman \n\n2002, Newman 2004, 2006).  \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nIn order to identify non-random encounters of Amazon understory forest birds and measure their \n\nchange with habitat disturbance, we decided to combine the two methodological approaches of null \n\nmodels and network analysis. While doing so, we will focus on pairwise measurements of \n\nassociation between species which will enable us to go beyond the whole ensemble view of the inter-\n\nspecific interaction. To do so, we create a new pairwise metric of association strength that results \n\nfrom the null model analysis and subsequently informs the construction of network graphs. Once \n\nhaving a network, we perform a modularity analysis for delimiting groups of interacting species \n\nabove the pairwise approach.  \n\nPerhaps the most striking aspect of our study is that we evaluate the association between species \n\nthrough an approach that, at the outset, assumes that such associations might as well not exist. \n\nInstead of going to the field and sampling animals that we determine to be part of an association, we \n\nsample animals without regard for their association status and let the data inform us of any patterns \n\nof co-detection. To strengthen our inference, we sample using two different techniques, automated \n\naudio recording and mist-netting. The analyses were first carried out separately by sampling \n\ntechnique and subsequently joined producing a view of interspecific associations that uses different \n\nlines of evidence. The results give a robust view of what species are most strongly associated and \n\nenable an analysis of how the associations play out in different habitat with different levels of \n\ndisturbance.  \n\n \n\nMETHODS \n\nStudy area and sampling design \n\nThis study draws on data collected between 2010 and 2015 at the Biological Dynamics of Forest \n\nFragments Project (BDFFP) area, 70 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (2\u00b030\u2019S 60\u00b0W; Fig. 1). \n\nThe area of approximately 300 square kilometers is covered by upland old-growth (OG) and \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nsecondary (SF) tropical rain forest, with an annual rainfall from 1900 to 2500 mm, and a pronounced \n\ndry season from June to December (Gascon and Bierregard 2001). The BDFFP started as a landscape \n\nmanipulation experiment aimed at understanding the effect of habitat removal and isolation on a \n\nbroad range of organisms and ecological parameters (Bierregaard and Lovejoy 1989). Prior to the \n\nproject onset, in 1979, the area was covered and surrounded by continuous OG forest. Between 1980 \n\nand 1984, three large cattle ranches were established (Stotz and Bierregaard 1989), with pasture \n\nestablished in approximately 20% of the area. The ranches were subsequently abandoned and the \n\npresent-day landscape consists almost entirely of forest cover, approximately one fifth of which is \n\nSF.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 1. Study area of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project showing our 151 recording sites \n\n(filled circles) and approximate location of the 38 mist-netting sites near Porto Alegre (left circle) and Cabo \n\nFrio (right circle) camps, Amazonas, Brazil. Sites are distributed through old growth (dark grey) and secondary \n\nforest (light grey). Pastures are represented in white, while roads, paved and unpaved, appear as continuous and \n\ndashed lines, respectively. \n\n \n\nWe based our study on two datasets of understory forest bird detections obtained with two different \n\nsampling techniques: audio recording and mist-netting. Both the audio recorders and the mist-nets \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nwere placed in the forest understory, but the audio data naturally represents a higher vertical section \n\nof the forest, as it can record vocalizations of the loudest birds all the way up to the forest canopy. \n\nMist-nets extended from the ground level up to 2.5 meters high.  For logistic convenience, recording \n\nquality, and bird safety, we sampled only during dry season months. Mist net captures took place \n\nbetween June 2009 and October 2015 (excluding 2010 and 2012), while audio recording took place \n\nbetween June and November 2010. \n\nThe audio dataset comprises 151 sites, 107 in OG and 44 in SF, distributed throughout the study \n\narea. Sites were sampled for four to six consecutive days each. The autonomous recorders worked \n\nunassisted for three hours per day per site, starting 40 minutes before sunrise (details in Figueira et al \n\n2015). Each three-hour recording was randomly subsampled with five, five-minute, non-overlapping \n\nrecording cuts that were subsequently processed in the lab by ornithologists with knowledge of the \n\nlocal bird sounds. Each cut produced a list of detected species. Mist-net captures happened over a \n\nsmaller, central portion of the study area covering 38 OG and SF sites. Lines of 4 to 15 mist-nets \n\nwere placed monthly (throughout the dry season of the mist-netting years) at a randomly selected \n\nsubset of sites. The 12-by-3 meter nets were opened from 6 am to 12 pm and checked every 30 \n\nminutes. One mist-net sample consists of one mist-net opened for 30 minutes and has an associated \n\nspecies list. \n\nStudy species \n\nWe focus our study on species that have been previously reported to occur in our study area and to \n\ntake part in inter-specific associations. Cohn-Haft et al. (1997) has the most complete list of the \n\nBDFFP avifauna, updated from Stotz and Bierregaard (1989) and including 394 species. Cohn-Haft \n\net al. (1997) also provide qualitative information about abundance, preferred habitat, and sociality \n\nstatus of each species. The sociality status is particularly relevant for us, because it lists species as \n\nforaging in monospecific flocks, mixed-species flocks of the canopy or understory, solitary or in \n\npairs, and as part of army-ant following flocks. Of these categories, the mixed-species and the ant-\n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nfollower flocks comprise inter-specific associations. We therefore built our study species list starting \n\nfrom all species that were listed as understory mixed-species or ant-following flock members by \n\nCohn-Haft et al. (1997; Table S1). To complete the list, we obtained information from other studies \n\nof BDFFP birds (Harper 1989, Stouffer and Bierregaard 1995) and from elsewhere in the \n\nbiogeographic region of the Guyana shield (Jullien and Thiollay 1998). As many species classified as \n\nbeing part of canopy flocks can spend many hours per day with understory flocks (Munn 1985), we \n\nalso included species described as canopy mixed-species flock members by Cohn-Haft et al. (1997) \n\nthat were reported as occasional understory mixed-species flock members by Jullien &amp; Thiollay \n\n(1998) and by Munn &amp; Terborgh (1979). In the end, we obtained a list of 37 target species, with \n\nhypothetical inter-specific associations listed in table S1.  \n\nData organization \n\nThe data sets resulting from the two sampling techniques were split by habitat (OG or SF), resulting \n\nin four sub-datasets: OG-audio, OG-capture, SF-audio and SF-capture. Each sub-dataset was \n\norganized as an observation matrix with i =1 to R rows, and j = 1 to C columns. Each row of the \n\ncapture data represents one 30-minute sample with one mist-net, while each row of the audio data \n\nrepresents one five-minute recording cut. Each column represents a species that was detected in the \n\ncorresponding row, either by captured or audio recording. Entry aij of the binary observation \n\nmatrices represents the detection (1) or non-detection (0) of species j in sample i. Summing across \n\nrows, one obtains Sj, which is the total number of detections of species j across all samples. Once \n\nhaving the four observation matrices, we obtained four associated co-detection matrices. Co-\n\ndetection matrices listed the observed species as rows and columns and show the number of times \n\nthat each possible species pair was detected in the same (audio or mist-netting) sample.  \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nQuantifying pairwise interspecific associations \n\nWe assess the strength of association between species by measuring the extent to which the observed \n\nnumber of co-detections could result from a simulated observation matrix where the distribution of \n\ndetections across samples was independent between species. To do this, we use the fixed-\n\nequiprobable algorithm of Gotelli (2000), where, for every species, the total number of detections per \n\n(Sj) is fixed but each detection has the same probability of happening on every sample. Under this \n\nalgorithm, the simulated number of species per sample (row total) can vary, but all occasions have \n\nthe same average number of species. Figuratively, this amounts to shuffling detections of each \n\nspecies across sites, independently between species. We employed the randomization algorithm \n\n1,000 times for each sub-dataset, each time simulating one observation and one co-detection matrix. \n\nThe 1,000 simulated co-detection matrices provide one distribution of co-detection for each pairwise \n\ncombination of species. In order to quantify the extent to which species associate more than expected \n\nunder the null model, one only has to look where the observed number of co-detections falls within \n\nthe simulated distribution.  \n\nOur pairwise index of association strength (AS) between two species measures the distance between \n\nthe observed number of co-detections and the mean number of simulated co-detections, in units of \n\nstandard deviation of the simulated distribution. Our AS index provides a better description of \n\ninterspecific association than a raw count of the number of times two species were seen together \n\nbecause it accounts for the inevitable fact that species that are detected more often have a higher \n\nchance of being co-detected with others than species that are rarely detected. Thus, the AS index can \n\nbe used for comparing association strengths between species pairs, between methods and between \n\nhabitats. High AS values mean that the species were detected together more times than expected \n\nunder the null model. Near-zero values indicate that observations are compatible with the null \n\nexpectations. We consider that there is a strong association between two species when AS is greater \n\nthan 2.576 SDs. Under a normal distribution of simulated co-detections, using this threshold value \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\namounts to a two-tailed test of the null hypothesis of no association between species, using a p-value \n\nof 0.01.   \n\nHaving the results from all pairwise associations, we built association strength matrices for each \n\nhabitat and sampling technique. In order to combine results from the two sampling techniques, we \n\nsimply calculated the arithmetic mean between AS indexes obtained for the same pair under the two \n\ntechniques. When a pair of species was detected by only one of the sampling techniques, we \n\nconsidered that technique alone in the combined analysis. In the end, we produced six AS index \n\nmatrices corresponding to OG-audio, OG-capture, OG-combined, SF-audio, SF-capture, and SF-\n\ncombined data. \n\nVisualizing and delimiting groups of interacting species \n\nBeyond measuring pairwise associations, we wanted to visualize association patterns at the level of \n\nthe whole set of study species. To do so, we built six weighted networks based on the six AS index \n\nmatrices using the software Gephi and the graph layout algorithm ForceAtlas2 (Jacomy et al 2014). \n\nEach node on a network represents a species and the \u2018degree\u2019 of a node, illustrated by its size, \n\nrepresents the number of links (or edges) that a species has with all other species. The weighted \n\nedges connected pairs of species with strong association (AS > 2.576), with edge width representing \n\nthe magnitude of the association. AS values smaller than or equal to 2.576 were not considered in the \n\nnetwork construction.  \n\nIn order to identify groups of species and measure the extent to which a network is \n\ncompartmentalized, we performed a modularity analysis based on the function cluster-louvain from \n\nthe R package igraph (Blondel et al 2008). This analysis returned a network graph showing the \n\npartition of species in groups and a modularity metric Q that quantifies the extent to which a network \n\nshows fewer edges than expected under a model of no compartmentalization (Newman 2006). \n\nOverall, species groups defined by the modularity analysis tended to associate amongst themselves \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nmore strongly than with species from other groups. To quantify this tendency, we calculated the \n\naverage AS values within and between modules, based only on the strong associations. This \n\nquantification and previous knowledge of species natural history helped us name each module and \n\ncompare our findings with the ornithological expectation compiled in table S1.  \n\nChange in interspecific association between old-growth and secondary-forest habitat  \n\nTo study the change in interspecific associations from OG to SF, we computed pairwise differences \n\nin the number of co-detections in SF and OG, separately for each sampling technique. Positive \n\ndifferences denote an increase, and negative differences a decrease in pairwise association from OG \n\nto SF. Subsequently, in an approach parallel to that used for generating AS values, we simulated \n\n1000 joint-habitat observation matrices for each technique. Each simulation shuffled each species\u2019 \n\ndetections across samples from both habitats, allowing that a detection from OG might be randomly \n\nplaced in a SF sample. Based on the 1000 simulations, we obtained distributions of SF-OG \n\ndifferences and an index of association change (AC) for each pair of species and sampling technique. \n\nOnce having the technique-specific AC values, we averaged them across techniques to obtain a \n\ncombined-data AC matrix. When a AC value is greater than 2.576 we say that the association \n\nbecame significantly stronger in SF; conversely, when AC is smaller than -2.576 we say that the \n\nassociation became significantly weaker. Combining information on AC and AS indices, we obtain \n\nthe nine possible scenarios for association change listed in Table 2. Broadly, there are three \n\nincreasing and three decreasing scenarios, plus to scenarios of no change and one scenario without \n\nevaluation. We could only evaluate changes with forest type when the two species of a pairwise \n\ncomparison had sufficient data (> 10 detections) in both habitats for at least one of the observation \n\ntechniques, when this is not the case, Table 2 cells show an \u2018NA\u2019 value. The two no-change \n\nscenarios indicate situations where AS is low (<2.576) in both habitats, with a low AC value \n\n(denoted by \u20180\u2019) and where AS is high in both habitats with low AC value (\u2018=\u2019). The three decreasing \n\nscenarios comprise: a) AS high in both habitats with high negative AC value (\u2018?\u2019); b) AS high in \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nOG but smaller than 2.576 in SF with a small negative AC value (\u2018??\u2019); and c) AS high in OG and \n\nlow in SF with a high negative AC value (\u2018???\u2019). Similarly, the three increase scenarios are: a) \n\nhigh positive AC value with high AS in both OG and SF (\u2018?\u2019); b) low AS in OG and high AS in SF \n\nwith small positive AC (\u2018??\u2019); and c) low AS in OG and high AS in SF, with high positive AC \n\nvalue.  \n\nRESULTS   \n\nData overview \n\nOur recording data consisted of 3,076 five-minute audio samples, 2,178 from OG and 898 from SF. \n\nThe aggregate of all audio samples contained 18,072 detections, 34% of which were detections of \n\nour target species, corresponding to 4,039 target-species detections in OG and 1,090 in SF. The \n\ncapture data consisted of 65,230 netting samples, 35,755 in OG and 29,475 in SF. These samples \n\nreturned a total of 6,455 individual bird captures, 58% of which were from our target species and \n\nwere split between 2,077 OG and 1,658 SF captures (Table S1). Three of the target species, the \n\nflycatchers Onychorhynchus coronatus, Terenotriccus erythrurus and Rhynchocyclus olivaceus were \n\nnot sampled ten or more times in OG with at least one of the sampling techniques, so they did not \n\nfulfill the criterion for inclusion and were dropped from the analysis.  \n\nGroup delimitation based on pairwise association in old growth forest \n\nAll 37 target species occurred in OG but only 34 fulfilled the criterion for inclusion in the analysis. \n\nAll 34 showed strong associations with at least one other species but some were detected less than \n\nten times with either of the sampling techniques and were excluded from technique-specific analyses. \n\nNamely, Epinecrophylla gutturalis, Isleria guttata, Dendrocincla merula and Mionectes macconnelli \n\nhad more than ten mist-net captures each, but were audio-recorded less than ten times in the OG \n\ndata. Conversely, Piculus flavigula, Lanio fulvus, Automolus ochrolaemus, Tolmomyias assimilis, \n\nSittasomus griseicapillus, Dendrocolaptes certhia, D. picumnus, Hylexetastes perrotii and \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nCampylorhamphus procurvoides had a sufficient number of audio-recordings but neither had more \n\nthan ten mist-net captures for inclusion in OG capture-data analyses.  \n\nThe pairwise analysis of audio samples returned association strengths of -2.49 to 16.32 SDs. There \n\nwere, in all, 117 strong associations in 406 possible associations (26.35%, Table S2). Pairwise \n\nassociation strengths from capture data ranged from -0.80 to 23.34 SDs, with 88 strong associations \n\nin 300 possible associations (29.33%, Table S3). When we combined results from both sampling \n\ntechniques into one triangular matrix of average association strengths, values ranged from -2.49 to \n\n17.39 SDs, with 132 strong associations over 561 possible associations (25.58%, Table S4). None of \n\nthe negative values were more than 2.576 SDs away from the mean of the null distribution. \n\nThe two networks based on the association strengths for each sampling technique were broadly \n\ncoincident (Fig. S1). The audio-data network partitioned the 29 analyzed species in three modules \n\ncomposed of twelve, ten and six species, with a modularity metric of Q = 0.209 (Fig. S1A). The \n\nsame analysis applied to the capture data produced a network with 25 species divided in four groups \n\nof nine, five, four and seven species. Here, the modularity metric was slightly higher, at Q = 0.237 \n\n(Fig. S1B). There are two sets of species that appear in the same group in both the audio- and the \n\ncapture-data networks. One set, at the center of the networks, is the quintet Thamnomanes \n\nardesiacus, T. caesius, Myrmotherula longipennis, M. menetriesii and Tunchiornis ochraceiceps; and \n\nthe second, always clearly separated from the first, is the trio Pithys albifrons, Gymnopithys rufigula \n\nand Percnostola rufifrons. The combination of audio and capture data into one triangular matrix of \n\ninteraction strengths, offers a single graphical representation of the associations in our data. (Table \n\nS4, Fig. 2). The modularity analysis of this joint-data network resulted in five modules with a metric \n\nQ = 0.248. Individual modules contained between five and eight species, with seven to 25 strong \n\nassociations within the module. We designate as \u2018core\u2019, the module of eight species with 25 strong \n\nassociations among them and a ratio of 3.13 strong associations per species (Table 1). The core \n\nmodule had the highest ratio of strong associations per species and the highest\u2014although extremely \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nvariable\u2014association strengths. The two modules designated as \u2018Attendant 1\u2019 and \u2018Attendant 2\u2019 had \n\nhigher average association strength within the module than with any other module, as did the Core \n\nand the \u2018Ant Follower\u2019 modules. Nonetheless, the two \u2018Attendant\u2019 modules have higher average \n\nassociation strength with the \u2018Core\u2019 than with any module other than themselves, which justifies \n\ntheir name. The \u2018Ant follower\u2019 module had the lowest average association strength with the \u2018Core\u2019 \n\nand is composed by species that are well known to forage around moving army-ant swarms. Finally, \n\nthere was only one module whose average association strength within the module was not higher \n\nthan all average association strengths between itself and other modules.

Among these, eighteen crossed the threshold with audio \n\ndata, eighteen with capture data, and thirteen with both. One third (32.35 %) of the target species \n\ndetected in OG were not detected in SF but 21 of the 23 species detected in SF showed at least one \n\nstrong pairwise association with some other species (Table S7). Microbates collaris and Sittasomus \n\ngriseicapillus did not show strong associations at all, so they were not included in the network \n\nanalysis.  \n\nThe pairwise analysis of audio samples returned association strengths of -1.32 to 11.32 SDs. These \n\nincluded 34 strong associations over 153 possible associations (22.22%; Table S5). The analysis of \n\ncapture data returned association strengths from -0.99 to 16.07 SDs, with 42 strong associations in \n\n153 possible associations (27.45%, Table S6). The combination of the two sampling techniques \n\nreturned a slightly lower proportion of strong links (52 / 253 or 20.55%, Table S7) than either \n\ntechnique taken in isolation. A few of the combined-data associations were negative, but none had an \n\nabsolute value greater than 2.576 SDs away from the mean of the null distribution. Comparing the \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\ncombined results from OG and SF, we see a decrease of nearly one fifth (19.66%) in the proportion \n\nof strong associations in SF relative to OG. \n\nAs in the OG, the technique-specific network analyses of SF data produced broadly coinciding \n\nresults (Qcapture=0.258, Qsound=0.201, Fig. S2); for simplicity, we focus on the combined-data network \n\n(Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that even thought the proportion of strong links decreases relative to that in \n\nOG, the modularity metric goes up, from Q = 0.248 to Q = 0.296. The 21 species were distributed in \n\nthree modules with three to nine species, and three to 21 strong associations per module (Fig. 3, \n\nTable S7). Some of the SF modules mirror those in OG, with, for example, T. caesius and M. \n\nmenestriesii strongly associated and present in the same group. Likewise, P. albifrons, G. rufigula \n\nand Willisornis poecillinotus, were once again found together in the same module. \n\n \n\nFig. 3. Secondary-forest interspecific association network, based on the combination of recording and mist-\n\nnetting data. Eight-letter codes, symbol, symbol size, and edge width as in Fig. 2. Colors represent groups \n\nformed in the network modularity analysis: SF-Core (Blue), SF-Attendant (Orange), and SF-Ant-follower \n\n(Green). Species names on the bottom give the composition of each group. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nThe analysis of association strengths within and between SF modules reflects the similarity between \n\nOG and SF networks (Table S8). Unlike in the OG data, here there is higher average association \n\nstrength within them between modules for all modules, i.e. no \u2018Unknown\u2019 group. We again designate \n\nas \u2018Core\u2019, or \u2018SF-Core\u2019, the module with the highest average and variability of association strengths. \n\nOnce again, this was the only module with a ratio of more than two strong links per species. Ranking \n\nthe remaining modules in decreasing order of average association to the \u2018SF-Core\u2019, the second \n\nmodule still had more than one strong link per species and showed a relatively high average \n\nassociation with the \u2018SF-Core\u2019; we designated this module as \u2018SF-Attendant\u2019. Finally, we gave the \n\nname \u2018SF-Ant-follower\u2019 for the last group containing only three ant-following species (Table S8, \n\nFig. 3).  \n\nTable 2 summarizes changes in pairwise association strength from OG to SF. It first becomes clear \n\nthat some of the species in the OG network of Figure 2 are not present in the comparison, because \n\nthey were not sufficiently detected in SF. The twenty-three species present in both habitats, \n\npotentially produced 253 pairwise comparisons; we can only evaluate 223 of these because some \n\nspecies pairs did not have sufficient data for both species under one single sampling technique\u2014a \n\ncondition for comparison. In all, 24 (~11%) associations that were strong in OG, were broken (or \n\nceased to be strong) in SF. Twenty-two (~10%) were either weaker than expected under the null \n\nmodel but still strong, or showed a numerical reduction that was no bigger than expected under the \n\nnull model of no change between habitats. On the opposite end of the spectrum, there were eight \n\n(<4%) new associations, which were strong in SF but absent in OG, and thirteen (~6%) which were \n\nalready present in OG and increased significantly in SF, or just increased from OG to SF albeit no \n\nmore than predicted by the null model. Finally, seventeen associations were present in both habitats \n\nwithout any significant change and 139 were absent in both habitats without significant change. \n\nLooking within the OG modules, the vast majority of changes are negative, with only two exceptions \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\nfor a significant increase in the associations W. poecillinotus - G. rufigula and W. poecillinotus - P. \n\nalbifrons associations, which were already present in the OG habitat.  \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nTable 2.

The evidence of interspecific association conveyed by this patterns is \n\nparticularly strong for three main reasons: i) it uses two different observation techniques, ii) it \n\naccounts for variations in the number of detections across species, and iii) it does not involve any \n\nsubjective decisions by field observers about whether two species are or are not part of the same \n\ngroup. AS index values revealed that approximately one fourth of all possible species pairings in old \n\ngrowth show strong, non-random association. Moreover, we found no evidence of repulsion, i.e. \n\nstrong negative AS values, suggesting the absence of interference competitive interactions that are \n\nstrong enough to result in inter-specific avoidance among the species in our study. Previous studies \n\nof interspecific associations in our study region (e.g. Jullien and Thiollay 1998, Mokross et al 2014) \n\nfocused on individual species rather than pairwise interactions, measuring \u2018mixed-species flocking \n\npropensity\u2019 as the proportion of times a species was detected in an observer-defined \u2018mixed-species\u2019 \n\ngroup out of the total number of detections for that species. With our approach, we can assess inter-\n\nspecific association at a pairwise level and combine the pairwise information for all species into a \n\nrepresentation of interactions among all species in the study set.  \n\nThe analysis of the network diagram based on association strengths between species in old-growth \n\nforest showed two distinct aggregates of species. One, aggregate, the ant-follower species was \n\nparticularly well separated from the other species. The other aggregate, which we termed \u2018Core\u2019 \n\nmixed-species flocking species had a high variance but also a high AS value. Three intermediate \n\ngroups\u2014Attendant 1, Attendant 2, and unknown\u2014were less clearly defined. These groups, resulting \n\nfrom the modularity analysis had a modularity metric Q between 0.2 and 0.3. Following Newman \n\n(2004), Q-values greater than 0.3 suggest the group structure is strong, therefore our network should \n\nbe described as diffuse. Nonetheless, except for a few odd associations (i.e. species not considered \n\nfrom the same class based on previous studies), the members of the modules based on the joint-data \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nnetwork coincide well with traditional categorizations of mixed-species flocks and ant-followers in \n\nthe central amazon (Table S1, Jullien and Thiollay 1998, Harper 1979); which means that our group \n\ndelimitation supports pre-existing ecological expectations.  \n\nIn total, sixteen species in our study fell on groups that are coincident with those defined in the \n\nprevious literature. Five species, including Thamnomanes caesius, T. ardesiacus, Myrmotherula \n\nlongipennis, M. menestriesii and Epinecrophylla gutturalis were considered as \u2018constant flock \n\nmembers\u2019 by Jullien &amp; Thiollay (1998) and were defined as \u2018Core\u2019 in our analyses. Two species, \n\nXenops minutus and Automulus infuscatus, classified as \u2018permanent members\u2019 (less than constant) by  \n\nJullien &amp; Thiollay (1998), were classified as \u2018Attendant 1\u2019 in our study. And likewise, three other \n\nspecies\u2014Glyphorynchus spirurus, Mionectes macconelli and Myobius barbatus\u2014that were \n\nclassified as \u2018frequent but not permanent members\u2019 by Jullien &amp; Thiollay (1998) appear as \n\n\u2018Attendant 2\u2019 in our study. Finally, six species of ant-following birds already classified as such by \n\nHarper (1979) were isolated from the other species in our analysis and appeared as \u2018Ant-followers\u2019 \n\nin our network division. These last species are generally aggregated at swarm of army ants (Willis \n\nand Oniki 1978, Harper 1979), so it makes sense to have them here all together in the same module. \n\nConsequently, we found our group delimitation relevant and consistent with previous expert \n\nknowledge, using simple co-detection matrices which do not require any a priori decision as to \n\nwhether two species are or are not interacting in the field.  \n\nThe analysis of SF data revealed a substantial loss of species and loss of associations among the \n\nremaining species.  In all, one third of the species studied in OG did not have sufficient data for \n\nanalysis in SF. At the same time, among those species that remained, there was a 20% reduction in \n\nthe number of strong associations. These results agree with the tendency for decreased species \n\nrichness and abundance found in previous analyses of disturbed forest habitat (Thiollay 1997, Lee et \n\nal 2005, Sodhi et al 2008, Sridhar and Sankar 2008, Mokross et al 2014). Nonetheless, we still found \n\nmany strong associations in SF, revealing that several mixed-species flock members and ant-\n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nfollowing birds are still appearing together there more than expected under the null model. Indeed, it \n\nis striking that even though more connections were lost than formed in the transition from OG to SF, \n\nthe modularity metric Q was slightly higher in SF (QOG = 0.248 and QSF = 0.296), albeit still \n\ncharacteristic of a diffuse network. As in the OG, the modularity of the SF network clearly separates \n\ntwo sets of mixed-species flocking and ant-following species.  \n\nLooking across all species, there are more than twice as many cases of decreased association (46) \n\nthan of increased association (21; Table 2). If, however, we look at changes in pairwise associations \n\nwithin the modules defined based on OG data, all evidence of change is negative, except for two \n\npairwise increases among ant-following species. This suggests that, 30 years after the onset of SF \n\nregrowth, the interaction between mixed-species flocking species may be more seriously disrupted \n\nthan the aggregation of ant-followers around army-ant swarms. We can only speculate about the \n\nreasons behind the overall reduction in association. Perhaps some changes are due to differences in \n\ncanopy height and vegetation density, which might influence flock attendance due to changes in \n\nexposure to predators (Thiollay 1997) or in prey availability (Develey and Peres 2000). The \n\nreduction in resource availability may constrain species to extend their space use and consequently \n\nreduce their flock attendance. These results support the idea that understory forest bird inter-specific \n\nassociations are fragile and vulnerable to disappearing as a result of habitat disturbance (Mokross et \n\nal 2014). It is an open question whether the weakening of inter-specific associations has any \n\nmeasurable effect on the fitness of the involved species.   \n\nOur study does not refute any previously held belief about interspecific association of Amazon \n\nunderstory forest birds, but it improves quantitative detail and robustness of the existing ideas about \n\ngroup delimitation and association changes with habitat disturbance. The key methodological choices \n\nbehind this improvement are the use of two different field sampling techniques, and the integration \n\nof a null model approach with the network representation of pairwise associations. The main \n\nadvantage of combining two sampling techniques \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nis the potential for reducing technique bias. Audio recording is an efficient approach for sampling \n\nbird presence across a broad range of vertical positions in dense, low-visibility tropical rainforests \n\n(Terborgh et al 1990). Furthermore, autonomous audio recording, which we used in this study, \n\nmakes it possible to sample birds without the interference of a human observer (Acevedo and \n\nVillanueva-Rivera 2006, Brandes 2008). The second technique, mist-net capture, makes it possible to \n\ndetect secretive and non-vocalizing birds (Blake and Loiselle 2001). Mist-nets do span a limited \n\nportion of the vertical profile of the forest, as they extend up to three meters in height at most. The \n\nspecies in our study move in a variety of heights throughout the forest, but with the exception of a \n\nfew mixed-species flocking birds that tend to forage above the mist-net level (e.g. Myrmotherula \n\nmenestriesii, Munn and Terborgh 1979), they tend to concentrate in the understory, within reach of \n\nthe mist-nets.  \n\nThree caveats should be considered when evaluating our methodological choices and constraints. \n\nFirst, our data were constrained by broadly non-overlapping spatial distribution of audio recording \n\nand mist-net samples. This makes it difficult to directly compare the performance of each technique \n\nwithout explicitly modeling detection probability; nonetheless, our finding of many similar \n\nassociations under both techniques strengthens our confidence in the findings. It is noteworthy, too, \n\nthat the combined data network showed an increase, albeit a slight one, of the modularity metric (i.e. \n\nhighest Q based on combined data). We conclude that even with difference spatial distribution of the \n\nsampling effort, the two techniques complement each other in an informative way. \n\nA second caveat relates to the idea that falling in the same mist-net within a period of 30 minutes or \n\ncalling within 5 minutes within the proximity of a recording device are not undisputable evidence of \n\nsocial interaction. This is particularly true when species have coincident and narrow schedules of \n\nvocal activity. Nonetheless, it is also true that social interaction will necessarily increase the \n\nprobability of calling together or falling in the same net. Species moving as a group will make \n\nconstant contact calls to stay grouped together or warn each other about the proximity of a predator, \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\na behavior that is well document for core mixed-species flocking species such as Thamnomanes sp. \n\n(Munn and Terborgh 1979, Martinez and Zenil 2012). Indeed, behavioral ecologists often use the \n\n\u2018gambit of the group\u2019 to define animal associations based on spatial proximity (Franks et al 2010). \n\nWe apply this reasoning in our interpretation of co-detection data. Despite its probabilistic nature, the \n\nuse of indirect evidence of interaction is useful for contrasting with previous work, because it does \n\nnot rely on subjective judgment of who is interacting with whom in the field. Whatever patterns we \n\nidentify with our approach are not influenced by prior expectation about social interaction and thus \n\nfulfill our objective of trying to detect hypothetical associations under the presumption that they do \n\nnot exist. \n\nThe third and final caveat relates to the use of degenerate matrices in our null model algorithms \n\n(Gotelli 2000, Connor and Simberloff 1983). Degenerate matrices include rows (or columns) that are \n\nfilled with zeros and they may not always be helpful in inferring associations. In our case, however, \n\nwe believe it is more appropriate to use degenerate than non-degenerate matrices. One row of zeros \n\nin our detection matrices represents an occasion where none of our target species was detected (an \n\nempty column would represent a species that is never detected). We did not include non-detected \n\ntarget species in any of our analysis, but the empty rows (i.e. occasions without detection) represent a \n\nbiologically meaningful situation as it is possible that some nets have no captures or some recordings \n\nhave no vocalizations because the individuals that could possibly be sampled there are concentrated \n\nelsewhere. That is why we decided to develop our analysis using degenerate observation matrices, a  \n\ndecision that finds support in the null model literature (Haefner 1988, Gotelli 2000).  \n\nMixed-species flocks and ant-follower birds in tropical forest are a real phenomenon of non-random \n\nassociations that can be found either from direct observations in the field or from indirect sampling \n\ntechniques. The groups that we delimited are ecologically meaningful as confirmed by direct \n\nobservations in previous studies. However, the associations between species are not stable when \n\nfaced with habitat disturbance; many of the associations observed in old-growth forest break down in \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nsecondary forest. In addition, some species were detected less or not at all in secondary forest. \n\nAssociations between species are clearly evident from the data, but we know next to nothing about \n\nthe extent to which they influence the fitness of the involved species. Future work should focus on \n\ndeveloping experimental or creative observation approaches to understand the extent to which the \n\nassociations that we report here are being subject to natural selection.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAcevedo, M.

Species within \n\ngroups are ranked by phylogeny order. \n\n \n\nPicu \n\nflav \n\nTham \n\narde \n\nTham \n\ncaes \n\nIsle \n\ngutt \n\nEpin \n\ngutt \n\nMyrm \n\nlong \n\nMyrm \n\nmene \n\nTunc \n\nochr \n\nLani \n\nfulv \n\nMyrm \n\naxil \n\nCert \n\nstic \n\nXeno \n\nminu \n\nAuto \n\nochr \n\nAuto \n\ninfu \n\nMion \n\nmacc \n\nGlyp \n\nspir \n\nPhil \n\neryt \n\nTolm \n\nassi \n\nMyio \n\nbarb \n\nMicr \n\ncoll \n\nTham \n\nmuri \n\nSitt \n\ngris \n\nDeco \n\nlong \n\nDend \n\ncert \n\nDend \n\npicu \n\nHyle \n\nperr \n\nXiph \n\npard \n\nCam \n\nproc \n\nPerc \n\nrufi \n\nPith \n\nalbi \n\nGym \n\nrufi \n\nWill \n\npoec \n\nDend \n\nmeru \n\nTham arde 0.81                                 \n\nTham caes 3.66 14.75                                \n\nIsle gutt NA -0.25 3.58                               \n\nEpin gutt NA 13.17 8.55 5.99                              \n\nMyrm long 1.79 12.16 15.17 -0.19 14.98                             \n\nMyrm mene 1.87 11.64 9.32 -0.11 5.18 17.39                            \n\nTunc ochr 3.04 13.59 8.24 6.68 15.33 10.31 15.04                           \n\nLani fulv 4.46 5.03 9.60 NA NA 2.34 3.64 7.35                          \n\nMyrm axil 1.79 5.07 6.77 -0.07 -0.12 3.69 4.67 8.31 2.16                         \n\nCert stic -0.50 1.71 1.57 -0.15 -0.28 4.35 4.86 4.37 -0.54 5.62                        \n\nXeno minu 0.82 4.72 1.37 -0.11 5.06 2.58 2.08 4.67 -0.35 1.10 6.08                       \n\nAuto ochr 0.54 -1.49 -0.59 NA NA 1.70 -0.55 -0.11 -0.85 -1.01 -0.38 0.42                      \n\nAuto infu -0.76 7.00 9.79 -0.13 -0.23 3.11 2.26 5.33 -0.96 13.95 -0.47 3.58 4.44                     \n\nMion macc NA 1.59 3.56 -0.18 -0.34 -0.36 -0.21 -0.30 NA -0.14 3.00 -0.22 NA 3.66                    \n\nGlyp spir 0.31 3.46 3.34 2.47 4.27 3.89 3.69 2.29 0.49 0.81 2.18 0.86 -0.70 -0.02 0.74                   \n\nPhil eryt 0.62 4.51 5.60 -0.07 6.70 2.15 1.80 6.75 0.46 1.09 -0.24 0.82 -0.57 0.87 -0.16 2.68                  \n\nTolm assi 2.35 1.19 7.42 NA NA 2.74 4.33 6.35 4.35 2.97 0.42 0.59 -1.00 -0.40 NA 4.96 3.17                 \n\nMyio barb NA -0.37 -0.37 -0.14 3.91 3.47 -0.16 -0.23 NA -0.11 4.13 6.04 NA -0.18 -0.26 5.44 7.70 NA                \n\nMicr coll 1.33 1.54 3.01 -0.10 -0.18 1.63 0.80 1.62 3.74 0.98 0.13 1.02 -0.53 0.41 -0.20 4.07 0.58 4.58 -0.14               \n\nTham muri 0.72 1.01 3.21 -0.09 -0.17 0.60 1.35 -0.13 2.78 0.52 0.25 -0.66 -0.12 2.13 -0.19 1.51 0.00 3.06 -0.15 1.02              \n\nSitt gris 1.40 0.50 2.32 NA NA 1.12 1.91 -1.12 1.42 0.03 -0.95 1.00 -1.49 -0.07 NA 1.31 0.11 1.26 NA 2.77 5.45             \n\nDeco long -0.14 3.73 1.44 -0.07 7.51 0.26 0.15 4.81 1.47 1.09 -0.32 -0.19 0.42 1.54 -0.15 1.38 1.52 1.05 -0.11 -0.39 0.09 -0.51            \n\nDend cert -0.69 0.42 1.04 NA NA -0.43 0.95 -2.01 -1.04 1.01 -1.07 2.32 -1.01 4.27 NA -0.50 1.86 -1.77 NA -1.97 3.46 0.75 5.27           \n\nDend picu -1.05 1.13 0.11 NA NA 0.71 1.64 1.36 -1.18 3.21 -0.51 0.66 -0.82 0.51 NA 0.71 -0.78 2.82 NA -0.06 0.76 -1.51 -0.22 2.07          \n\nHyle perr -0.01 0.38 -0.90 NA NA 0.52 2.71 -0.45 1.10 0.35 -0.70 0.46 0.84 2.51 NA 0.52 0.95 0.96 NA -2.49 4.27 -0.38 5.40 5.93 4.14         \n\nXiph pard 1.45 11.67 7.58 4.78 5.72 5.93 5.77 4.89 2.44 3.27 3.32 5.50 1.85 8.58 -0.37 2.53 1.74 3.81 -0.29 0.06 3.21 3.64 7.73 4.58 3.25 6.47        \n\nCamp proc 0.42 2.61 1.28 NA NA 2.76 3.15 -1.16 2.56 0.91 2.14 1.48 -0.62 0.60 NA 0.60 -0.60 1.50 NA -1.38 1.93 -0.19 0.30 3.90 1.57 5.25 1.97       \n\nPerc rufi 0.95 1.20 2.26 -0.17 2.87 0.30 0.03 0.10 -0.41 0.92 -0.14 0.66 1.05 0.23 -0.35 1.47 -0.47 3.73 -0.26 -0.43 1.17 2.67 -0.18 0.22 0.99 0.30 0.44 -0.21      \n\nPith albi 0.86 2.76 3.38 -0.40 0.73 0.96 -0.24 0.58 -0.06 1.76 1.33 -0.22 1.47 1.13 -0.79 2.29 -0.12 1.13 -0.58 2.22 1.14 1.27 0.40 -1.14 1.21 -0.76 0.53 1.27 1.92     \n\nGymn rufi 0.94 -0.26 1.36 -0.27 1.63 1.09 -0.46 -0.21 1.66 0.78 -0.47 -0.25 0.50 1.15 -0.53 1.22 -0.49 -1.13 -0.38 -0.42 0.73 0.24 -0.19 -1.26 -1.09 -0.75 0.42 -0.83 3.11 7.78    \n\nWill poec -1.71 1.82 2.01 -0.33 -0.57 0.37 0.22 0.98 1.02 0.49 -0.01 -0.22 1.20 1.02 -0.62 0.92 0.11 0.97 -0.48 0.69 0.75 1.27 0.74 0.08 -0.58 -0.17 0.42 -0.56 3.43 2.47 0.49   \n\nDend meru NA -0.49 1.52 -0.19 -0.33 -0.36 -0.22 -0.29 NA -0.13 2.83 -0.21 NA -0.27 2.30 -0.69 -0.16 NA -0.27 -0.20 4.81 NA -0.16 NA NA NA -0.38 NA 5.32 9.77 5.14 -0.64  \n\nDend fuli -0.54 -0.33 -0.12 -0.10 -0.19 -0.06 -0.74 -1.00 -0.71 0.01 0.41 0.33 -1.01 0.08 -0.21 1.72 1.11 0.71 -0.15 -0.47 0.08 -0.79 0.74 1.87 2.39 0.98 0.89 0.89 0.48 0.49 0.74 -0.05 4.81 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. S1.

Species within \n\ngroups are ranked according to the South American Classification Committee list. \n\n \n\nTham \n\narde \n\nTham \n\ncaes \n\nMyrm \n\naxil \n\nMyrm \n\nmene \n\nDend \n\ncert \n\nXiph \n\npard \n\nXeno \n\nminu \n\nAuto \n\ninfu \n\nTolm \n\nassi \n\nTham \n\nmuri \n\nEpin \n\ngutt \n\nPerc \n\nrufi \n\nDend \n\nmeru \n\nDend \n\nfuli \n\nGlyp \n\nspir \n\nAuto \n\nochr \n\nMion \n\nmacc \n\nMyio \n\nbarb \n\nPith \n\nalbi \n\nGymn \n\nrufi \n\nWill \n\npoec \n\nSitt \n\ngris \n\nTham caes 10.56                              \n\nMyrm axil 2.26 2.74                      \n\nMyrm mene 9.32 11.32 5.19                     \n\nDend cert 3.08 1.97 -0.52 1.36                    \n\nXiph pard 1.38 2.57 2.44 5.35 1.89                   \n\nXeno minu -0.11 4.45 -0.15 NA NA 7.38                  \n\nAuto infu 8.62 11.60 4.56 8.86 3.29 7.00 -0.11                 \n\nTolm assi 3.67 6.34 0.09 3.32 -0.01 3.01 NA 4.34                \n\nTham muri 1.67 0.04 0.72 0.94 0.97 1.47 -0.12 3.14 -0.46                       \n\nEpin gutt 10.64 13.27 -0.24 NA NA 2.97 -0.14 -0.26 NA -0.23              \n\nPerc rufi -0.13 1.45 1.00 -1.01 -1.25 0.03 -0.20 -0.04 -1.35 6.37 7.70             \n\nDend meru -0.23 -0.38 -0.25 NA NA -0.27 -0.13 -0.25 NA -0.20 12.98 -0.35            \n\nDend fuli -0.47 0.32 0.38 1.08 0.52 -0.18 -0.06 1.16 0.00 0.20 -0.16 -0.36 6.66           \n\nGlyp spir 2.60 3.31 0.97 1.70 0.36 0.57 -0.26 1.15 2.34 1.93 8.76 0.60 -0.47 -0.19          \n\nAuto ochr 4.98 0.49 -0.26 -1.09 0.89 1.50 -0.13 1.32 -0.61 4.86 3.89 1.58 -0.18 -0.40 2.29         \n\nMion macc 3.18 -0.46 -0.29 NA NA -0.32 -0.16 2.95 NA 3.24 -0.33 -0.43 -0.27 4.83 0.96 3.32        \n\nMyio barb -0.17 -0.23 -0.18 NA NA -0.15 -0.07 -0.14 NA -0.11 -0.16 -0.23 -0.13 -0.12 6.13 -0.16 -0.17       \n\nPith albi 2.19 4.13 -0.67 1.52 -0.18 1.00 -0.41 2.21 2.84 0.76 0.34 2.40 3.23 0.03 -1.02 0.77 -0.90 -0.47        \n\nGymn rufi 4.26 1.29 -0.54 -0.63 -0.84 0.12 -0.22 -0.56 -0.12 0.03 -0.46 0.86 2.19 -0.36 0.49 0.70 -0.50 -0.27 5.37     \n\nWill poec 0.07 -0.04 0.16 0.03 -0.55 3.07 -0.22 2.45 0.72 0.27 6.66 3.07 2.14 -0.46 1.69 0.46 -0.45 -0.25 3.78 3.75    \n\nSitt gris 0.28 0.27 -0.84 -0.75 0.15 0.20 NA -0.84 0.35 1.00 NA 0.50 NA 1.42 -0.54 0.34 NA NA -1.02 -0.52 -0.79  \n\nMicr coll 0.67 0.89 -0.69 1.05 -0.83 -1.16 NA -0.72 -1.09 2.06 NA 1.59 NA 2.09 1.97 -0.67 NA NA 2.05 2.01 0.83 -0.50 \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. S2.

Indeed, we were able \n\nto find the evidence of non-random inter-specific encounter within bird species based on data collected with \n\nautomated sound recording and mist-netting capture. We found many strong associations between species. \n\nFrom those, we were able to delimit groups of species more often associated than by chance with ecological \n\nmeanings. Those groups were confirmed by previous classifications from other studies.  \n\nIn addition, our second objective was to be able to observe a change in association with habitat disturbance, \n\nand that is what we successfully observed. We found that some species were detected less or not at all in \n\nsecondary forest. Also, many of the associations between species observed in old-growth forest breaks down \n\nin secondary forest; which was a proof of a non-stability of those associations. In the end, our work show \n\nthat social associations between understory Amazonian bird species was highly sensitive to habitat \n\ndisturbance.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\nAllan, J.
