As cascas de batata-doce (sweet \n\npotato peels, SPP) s\u00e3o consideradas um res\u00edduo na maioria dos processos de \n\ntransforma\u00e7\u00e3o do tub\u00e9rculo. Apesar de consumidas em algumas partes do mundo, as \n\nfolhas (sweet potato leaves, SPL) n\u00e3o s\u00e3o ainda utilizados na dieta de muitos pa\u00edses. Estes \n\nres\u00edduos apresentam potencial para a sua convers\u00e3o em alimentos funcionais com elevado \n\nteor de compostos fen\u00f3licos e alta atividade antioxidante. Neste contexto, foi \n\ndesenvolvido um prot\u00f3tipo de bancada para uma bebida antioxidante \u00e0 base de SPP com \n\npotenciais benef\u00edcios para a sa\u00fade associados \u00e0 prote\u00e7\u00e3o do stress oxidativo. As etapas \n\ndo processo de desenvolvimento do novo produto foram: revis\u00e3o da literatura e de \n\npatentes, estudo preliminar, rastreio de fatores-chave, otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da extra\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\notimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da formula\u00e7\u00e3o. O teor total de compostos fen\u00f3licos (total phenolic content, \n\nTPC) e a atividade antioxidante foram avaliados respetivamente, pelo m\u00e9todo Folin-\n\nCiocalteau e ensaios in vitro. A revis\u00e3o da literatura e de patentes para o per\u00edodo 2003-\n\n2014 revelou lacunas na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, para SPL e especialmente para SPP, em aplica\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nalimentares com benef\u00edcios para a sa\u00fade. Da pesquisa realizada nas bases de dados ISI \n\nWeb of Knowledge e ESPACENET foram selecionados e analisados 122 artigos e 170 \n\npatentes. O desenvolvimento de novos produtos e a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de ferramentas de design \n\nexperimental foram hiatos identificados em estudos sobre SPP e SPL. Para SPP, foi ainda \n\nidentificada a necessidade da an\u00e1lise da atividade antioxidante, da composi\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\nfen\u00f3licos e a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de ensaios pr\u00e9-cl\u00ednicos e cl\u00ednicos. O produto alimentar mais \n\nestudado, nos artigos, foi na forma de farinha/p\u00f3 enquanto que nas patentes foi a bebida. \n\nDeste modo, a valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o das SPP e SPL atrav\u00e9s do desenvolvimento de uma bebida \n\ncom atividade antioxidante, recorrendo a ferramentas de desenho experimental e an\u00e1lise \n\nda atividade antioxidante in vitro, ir\u00e1 preencher lacunas identificadas na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o. A \n\nminera\u00e7\u00e3o de textos (texto mining), aplicada aos resumos dos artigos e das patentes, \n\nidentificou eficazmente os principais temas de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o. No estudo preliminar foram \n\ninvestigados os efeitos de uma vari\u00e1vel de produto (ramas de batata-doce) e de duas \n\nvari\u00e1veis de processo (tempo e solvente de extra\u00e7\u00e3o) em TPC e no teor de flavonoides \n\n(total flavonoid content, TFC) bem como na atividade antioxidante in vitro. Os m\u00e9todos \n\nutilizados na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da atividade antioxidante in vitro foram a atividade antioxidante \n\n\n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \nviii \n\n \n\ntotal (total antioxidant activity, TAA), o poder redutor (reducing power, RP), o poder \n\nredutor do ferro (ferric reducing activity, FRAP) e o m\u00e9todo de sequestro de radicais \n\nlivres de 2,2-difenil-1-picrilhidrazila (DPPH). As experi\u00eancias foram realizadas de \n\nacordo com um plano fatorial completo para tr\u00eas fatores: parte da planta (caule ou folhas), \n\ntempo (24, 48 ou 72 h) e solvente (n\u00e3o acidificado e acidificado). O fator mais importante \n\ninfluente nas respostas foi a parte da planta seguido do fator solvente. TPC, TFC, FRAP \n\ne RP apresentaram uma elevada influ\u00eancia do fator parte da planta enquanto que o \n\nsolvente apresentou um maior efeito no m\u00e9todo DPPH. O tempo de extra\u00e7\u00e3o teve \n\nunicamente influ\u00eancia em RP, tanto como efeito principal como em intera\u00e7\u00e3o com o fator \n\nparte da planta. As atividades antioxidante das folhas foram 1,25 g de equivalentes de \n\n\u00e1cido asc\u00f3rbico (ascorbic acid equivalent, AAE)/100 g (peso seco) para TAA e 50,8 g de \n\nequivalentes de \u00e1cido g\u00e1lico (galic acid equivalente, GAE,)/100 g para RP. A atividade \n\nsequestrante do radical DPPH foi superior \u00e0 atividade antioxidante medida por FRAP \n\n(.i.e., 58,6 e 29,3 mM de equivalentes de Trolox (Trolox equivalent, TE)/g de peso seco, \n\nrespetivamente). A etapa seguinte, do processo de desenvolvimento, foi o rastreio de \n\nfatores chave na extra\u00e7\u00e3o de compostos fen\u00f3licos de farinhas de SPP. Para tal, utilizou-\n\nse um design experimental de 12 ensaios de Plackett-Burman tendo como vari\u00e1veis a \n\nraz\u00e3o solvente: s\u00f3lido (10 ou 50 mL/g), o tempo (60 ou 180 min), o pH (2,3 ou 7,0), a \n\nprofundidade do corte da casca (1,5 ou 3,0 mm), o tamanho das part\u00edculas (<600 ou&lt;300 \n\n\u00b5 m), a temperatura (27 ou 40 \u00baC), o solvente (\u00e1gua destilada ou \u00e1gua do abastecimento \n\np\u00fablico), o tamanho da amostra (0,1 ou 1,0 g) e o n\u00edvel de agita\u00e7\u00e3o (50 ou 200 rpm). Os \n\nfatores chave significativos (p&lt;0,05) para TPC foram a raz\u00e3o solvente: s\u00f3lido (efeito \n\npositivo) e a profundidade do corte da casca (efeito negativo). Estes dois fatores \n\napresentaram efeitos de dire\u00e7\u00e3o, magnitude e signific\u00e2ncia semelhante para FRAP. Os \n\nmodelos de regress\u00e3o obtidos para os resultados de FRAP, transformados pela fun\u00e7\u00e3o raiz \n\nquadrada, mostraram a intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre os fatores profundidade de corte e tamanho da \n\namostra como o terceiro efeito mais influente. A modela\u00e7\u00e3o e otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da extra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\naquosa de compostos fen\u00f3licos, com atividade antioxidante, de farinhas de SPP foram \n\nrealizadas recorrendo \u00e0s metodologias de Superf\u00edcie de Resposta (Response Surface \n\nMethodology, RSM) e de Redes Neurais Artificiais (Artificial Neural Network, ANN). A \n\nraz\u00e3o solvente: s\u00f3lido (30 a 60 mL/g), o tempo (30 a 90 min) e a temperatura (25 a 75 \u00baC) \n\nforam combinados de acordo com um plano de experi\u00eancias de composto central (Central \n\nComposite Design, CCD). Os fatores temperatura e a raz\u00e3o solvente: s\u00f3lido, \n\n\n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \nix \n\n \n\nindividualmente e em intera\u00e7\u00e3o, apresentaram um efeito positivo quer para TPC quer para \n\nos m\u00e9todos ABTS e DPPH. Individualmente, o fator tempo,teve uma influ\u00eancia negativa \n\nno m\u00e9todo ABTS e, quando combinado com a temperatura, apresentou o mesmo efeito \n\npara TPC e para o m\u00e9todo ABTS. A dire\u00e7\u00e3o da influ\u00eancia do fator tempo foi sempre \n\nnegativa e de magnitude inferior aos efeitos positivos dos outros fatores. As condi\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nextra\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3timas obtidas foram 60 mL/g, 45 min e 75 \u00b0C com valores previstos para os \n\nm\u00e9todos TPC, ABTS e DPPH de 11,87 \u00b1 0,69 mg GAE, 12,91 \u00b1 0,42 mg TE e 46,35 \u00b1 \n\n3,08 mg TE por g de material seco, respetivamente. O rendimento em compostos \n\nfen\u00f3licos e as respetivas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de extra\u00e7\u00e3o obtidas para SPP foram semelhantes aos \n\nconseguidos para as cascas de batata, as cascas de fruta do ch\u00e1 (Camelia sinensis L.) e as \n\ncascas de manga (Mangifera pajang Kostern). A etapa final do desenvolvimento do novo \n\nproduto consistiu na otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da formula\u00e7\u00e3o de uma bebida antioxidante, tendo como \n\ncomponentes um extrato aquoso de SPP (SPPE), um extrato aquoso de SPL (SPLE) e \n\numa solu\u00e7\u00e3o de mel (HonS). As formula\u00e7\u00f5es foram testadas de acordo com um desenho \n\nde mistura I-optimal sendo avaliadas pelos m\u00e9todos TPC, FRAP, DPPH e pelos s\u00f3lidos \n\nsol\u00faveis (SS). A modela\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados foi realizada pelas metodologias de regress\u00e3o dos \n\nm\u00ednimos quadrados (least squared regression, LSR) e ANN. Os componentes \n\napresentaram um efeito positivo para os m\u00e9todos TPC, FRAP e DPPH na seguinte ordem: \n\nSPLE> SPPE> HonS. Foram observados efeitos sinerg\u00e9ticos entre SPPE e HonS, SPLE \n\ne HonS e SPPE e SPLE, e todos os efeitos antag\u00f3nicos foram n\u00e3o significativos (p> 0,05). \n\nA formula\u00e7\u00e3o \u00f3tima da bebida foi obtida pela metodologia ANN tendo como resultado \n\n50,0 % de SPPE, 21,5 % de SPLE e 28,5 % de HonS. Os valores previstos para os m\u00e9todos \n\nTPC, FRAP, DPPH e para SS foram respetivamente 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, 1098 \n\nmg TE/L e 12,3 \u00baBrix, tendo-se obtido resultados id\u00eanticos com a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos modelos \n\nLSR. O prot\u00f3tipo posicionou-se pr\u00f3ximo das bebidas comerciais de frutas e vegetais \n\nquanto \u00e0 sua atividade antioxidante. A transfer\u00eancia de conhecimento destes resultados \n\npara a ind\u00fastria alimentar pode oferecer uma oportunidade para a valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de SPP e \n\nSPL promovendo paralelamente o interesse na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em aplica\u00e7\u00f5es alimentares \n\ncom benef\u00edcios para a sa\u00fade.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: cascas de batata-doce, folhas de batata-doce, atividade antioxidante, \n\ncompostos fen\u00f3licos, planeamento de experi\u00eancias, bebida funcional.  \n\n\n\n\n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \nxi \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nThe valorisation of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) wastes into a food application with \n\nhealth benefits was studied using a product development framework to translate a product \n\nconcept into a benchtop prototype. A functional beverage with attributes related to \n\noxidative stress protection was developed using sweet potato peel (SPP) and sweet potato \n\nleaf (SPL) as components. The developing processes involved the following steps: \n\nliterature and patent review, preliminary study, key factors screening, extraction \n\noptimization and beverage formula optimization. Total phenolic content (TPC) and \n\nantioxidant activity was measured by Folin-Ciocalteau method and antioxidant activity \n\nby in vitro screening assays. Literature and patent review for the period 2003-2014 \n\nidentified research gaps on food applications with health benefits for SPL and especially \n\nSPP. Text mining analysis on articles abstracts could picture research main themes. A \n\npreliminary study using a factorial design revealed that plant part (stems or leaves) \n\npresented the largest main significant effect (p &lt;0.001) on TPC, total flavonoids content \n\n(TFC), total antioxidant activity (TAA), reducing power (RP) and ferric reducing activity \n\npower (FRAP) while for DPPH scavenging assay, solvent acidification was the most \n\ninfluential factor. Time of extraction had the only significant effect on RP assay, as main \n\neffect and interaction with plant part. Solvent: solid ratio and peel cut depth were the key \n\nfactors identified by a Plackett-Burman design for the aqueous extraction of phenolics of \n\nSPP flour. The aqueous extraction conditions of phenolic from SPP flour were modelled \n\nby Response Surface Methodology (RSM) and Artificial neural Network (ANN) analysis \n\nof a Central composite Design (CCD) experimental plan. Optimized conditions were 60 \n\nmL/g for solvent: solid ratio, 30 min for time and 75 \u00baC for temperature. Predicted \n\nresponses were 11.87 \u00b1 0.69 mg GAE/g DM for TPC, 12.91 \u00b1 0.42 mg TE/g DM for \n\nABTS and 46.35 \u00b1 3.08 mg TE/g DM for DPPH assay. Beverage formula components \n\nSPP aqueous extract (SPPE), SPL water extract (SPLE) and honey solution (HonS) were \n\ncombined according to a mixture design. The optimized formula obtained by ANN \n\nmodels for the SPP beverage benchtop prototype was 50.0 % of SPPE, 21.5 % of SPLE \n\nand 28.5 % of HonS. TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS predicted responses for the \n\noptimal formula were 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, 1098 mg TE/L and 12.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00baBrix, \n\nrespectively. Beverage positioned next to commercial vegetable and fruit beverages in \n\nterms of antioxidant activity.

Originated on the \n\nAmerican continent at least 5000 years ago, it was brought to Europe in1492. Portuguese \n\nexplorers of the sixteenth century took it to Africa and Asia (Loebenstein, 2009), however, it \n\nseems that sweet potato has a long history cultivation in Oceania (Lebot, 2009). The tuberous \n\nroot of the plant is most commonly consumed in the Western part of the world, but sweet potato \n\nleaves, consumed primarily in the islands of Pacific Ocean and in Asian and African countries, \n\nare decidedly rich in nutrients and functional compounds (Johnson &amp; Pace, 2010). In 2013, \n\nsweet potato ranked as the 14th top commodity by quantity production, 1.11 x 108 ton. \n\nAccording to 2011 proportions, the main destination of total amount produced was food supply \n\n(53 %), followed by feed (40 %) and waste (7 %) (FAOSTAT, 2014). There are no official data \n\nfor sweet potato tops, however the harvested area of 8.2 million hectare can be used for the \n\nestimation of vines production. Considering an average yield of 30 ton of fresh vines per hectare \n\nfrom Hartemink et al. (2000), 2.46 x 108 tons of fresh vines could have been produced during \n\n2013.  \n\nSweet potato peels had also received attention for food applications as they possessed high \n\nlevels of phenolics (Zhu, Cai, Yang, Ke, &amp; Corke, 2010) and can reach almost three times more \n\nantioxidant activity than the other plant tissues (Cevallos-Casals &amp; Cisneros-Zevallos, 2001). \n\nPeels are one of the major wastes generated during the processing of sweet potato and currently \n\nit has reduced market value (Maloney, Truong, &amp; Allen, 2012).  \n\nSweet potato leaves were classified as a physiologically functional food which offers protection \n\nfrom various diseases (Islam, 2006) and health promotion by reducing oxidative stress (Johnson \n\n&amp; Pace, 2010). Their role is mediated by the ability to promote more favourable antioxidant \n\nstatus, free radical scavenging capacities, and prevent processes involved in disease \n\npathogenesis (Johnson &amp; Pace, 2010). Active compounds were grouped into two types of \n\npolyphenols as anthocyanins and phenolic acids. The anthocyanins were acylated cyanidin and \n\npeonidin type while the phenolic acids were composed of caffeic acid and five kinds of \n\ncaffeoylquinic acid derivatives (Islam, 2006). Physiological functions related to these \n\npolyphenols as radical scavenging, antimutagenic, anticancer, antidiabetes, antibacterial, anti-\n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n4 \n\n \n\ninflammatory, cardioprotective and chemopreventive activities have been demonstrated in vitro \n\nand in vivo. (Islam, 2006; Johnson &amp; Pace, 2010) \n\nResearch has been done on the recovery of various chemical substances as  polyphenolics from \n\nfood processing wastes as they are highly valuable compounds that may be used as functional \n\nfood ingredients and as natural antioxidants as they can be readily extracted by simple methods \n\nand can then be used for the preparation of functional foods or ingredients (Barber\u00e1n &amp; \n\nWaldron, 2007). Recycling of agro wastes into value added products with potential health \n\nbenefits could be achieved through extraction, (Peschel et al., 2006). The biological activity of \n\nextracts from food wastes needs more research (Barber\u00e1n &amp; Waldron, 2007).  \n\nFunctional foods demand a continuous innovative approach to develop convenient and healthy \n\nfoods according to consumer\u2019s expectations (Betoret, Betoret, Vidal, &amp; Fito, 2011). It is a \n\nmultistage process that requires input from commercial, academic, regulatory and consumer \n\ninterests. The commencing stages involves the translation of an essential concept often \n\noriginated from academic research into a prototype (Jones &amp; Jew, 2007). A competitive \n\ninnovation environment in the food industry requires a collaborative knowledge development \n\nand resource sharing activities among stakeholders academics and industry (Khan, Grigor, \n\nWinger, &amp; Win, 2013). Teams of academics working with business interests could deliver an \n\noptimal product concept that enables forward the innovation cycle (Jones &amp; Jew, 2007). The \n\nassessment of efficacy for a prototype can be performed using in vitro systems with further \n\nproof-of-concept testing animal and human trials (Jones &amp; Jew, 2007). The information \n\nobtained with in vitro antioxidant assays was considered adequate for the evaluation of food \n\nquality although not of food biofunctionality. The assessment of food antioxidant functionality \n\nuniquely by this non-compositional approach contains several drawbacks and difficulties due \n\nto several factors that can affect the measurement in food matrices (Pompella et al., 2013). \n\n \n\nThis thesis was a result of several extrinsic and intrinsic motivations shaped by context factors:  \n\no Functional foods, a category of the health and wellbeing market,  are becoming a major \n\nfocus of new product development in the food industry (Khan et al., 2013);  \n\no The growth of health and wellness beverage market is set to outperform the wider soft \n\nand hot drinks industry through 2016 (Euromonitor International, 2013); \n\no Sustainability values are driving a growing interest in the valorisation of agro-wastes \n\nvalorisation in functional products (Spatafora &amp; Tringali, 2012);  \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n5 \n\n \n\no Although recognized as providing significant protection against the development and \n\nprogression of many chronic diseases, the role of polyphenols in human health is still a \n\nfertile area of research (Pandey &amp; Rizvi, 2009);  \n\no Substantial evidence indicates that antioxidants may be of great benefit in improving \n\nthe quality of life by preventing or postponing the onset of degenerative diseases (Alam, \n\nBristi, &amp; Rafiquzzaman, 2013);  \n\no Sweet potato is being cultivated traditionally in Algarve that holds a Protected \n\nGeographical Indication (PGI) by the European Union (European Union, 2008); \n\no Actual trend on the revival forgotten healthy food as sweet potato leaves that were \n\nconsumed in Algarve in the form of salads, soups or saut\u00e9e in 1940\u2019s (Nascimento, \n\n1944); \n\no In the beginning of the thesis, Food Science Lab had just published a study on sweet \n\npotato leaves including its polyphenolic profile (Carvalho, Cavaco, Carvalho, &amp; Duque, \n\n2010); \n\no Researcher aims to transfer research methodology/results to industry, with focus on \n\nwaste valorisation through functional food product development. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1. Research aims \n\n \n\nA great variability of techniques is required in order to meet the needs and expectancies in the \n\narea of functional foods. Traditional techniques as formulation have a long history in the \n\ndevelopment of successful functional foods (Khan et al., 2013) and as they constitute simple \n\nand cheap processing methods. In the past decades, the uses of sweet potato have diversified \n\nconsiderably, having great potential as a source of local value-added products and ingredients. \n\nSome examples include food products like noodles and desserts and some industrial products \n\nsuch as flour or starch. Sweet potato flour can be fermented to make products like soy sauce \n\nand alcohol, or if immediately cooked, it can be further processed into wine, vinegar and \u201cnata \n\nde coco\u201d, a popular dessert in the Philippines and in Japan. Drying, freezing or processing sweet \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n6 \n\n \n\npotatoes into a frozen prepared food may benefit producers or processors by extending product \n\nshelf life (Huntrods, 2013). Alternative food products, particularly frozen type have become \n\ncommercially available and are steadily growing. Sweet potato beverages were marketed since \n\n1997 in Japan and dried sweet potato snacks manufactured by Chinese companies are sold as a \n\nhealth food for weight loss (Barnes &amp; Sanders, 2012).  \n\nSweet potato tuber has also been profusely included in the composition of innovative \n\napplications such as ice-cream (Gurgel, Farias, Farias, &amp; Moreira, 2011) or non-carbonated \n\ndrink (Wireko-Manu, Ellis, &amp; Oduro, 2010). Functional uses for tuber includes fries and chips, \n\nflakes, and yogurt (Barnes &amp; Sanders, 2012). Leaf dry powder for juice, paste and  ice cream \n\nwas suggested applications besides tea, breads, confectioneries, and as a nutritional supplement \n\n(Islam, 2006). As the growth of health and wellness beverage market is set to outperform the \n\nwider soft and hot drinks industry through 2016 (Euromonitor International, 2013), an \n\nantioxidant beverage could be a promising valorisation of sweet potato wastes as peels and \n\nleaves. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. Objectives \n\n \n\nThe general objectives defined for this Thesis were: \n\n \n\no Propose a framework for the valorisation of agro wastes into a food application through \nthe development of a benchtop prototype with added value; \n\no Characterize sweet potato wastes as peels and leaves antioxidant activity; \n\no Define the optimal operational settings for the aqueous extraction of phenolics with \nantioxidant activity from sweet potato peels; \n\no Propose an antioxidant beverage benchmark prototype using as components sweet \npotato peel, sweet potato leaves and honey. \n\n \n\nThe specific objectives defined were: \n\n \n\no Use of text mining tools in the analysis of articles and patents to picture the state of the \nart regarding sweet potato food applications with antioxidant activities; \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n7 \n\n \n\no Analyse the effects of vine part, time and solvent on the antioxidant activity of vines of \nsweet potato;  \n\no Analyse the correlation between total phenolic content and antioxidant activities of \nsweet potato peels and leaves extracts;  \n\no Screen the factors that alone and combined influence the extraction of phenolic \ncompounds with antioxidant activity of sweet potato peels;  \n\no Model the effect of solvent: solid ratio, time and temperature on the extraction of \nphenolic compounds with radical scavenging activity from sweet potato peels; \n\no Use of design of experiments as factorial design, Plackett-Burman design, response \nsurface methodology and mixture design though research for higher efficiency; \n\no Include multivariate data analysis tools as principal component analysis (PCA), \nhierarquical cluster analysis (HCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) to enhance \nconclusion robustness. \n\no Develop a functional antioxidant beverage prototype using sweet potato peel aqueous \nextract, sweet potato leaves aqueous extract and honey solution as components and a \nmixture design. \n\no Provide tools to benchmark in vitro antioxidant results with published data on \ncommercial and laboratory food products. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.3. Outline of the Thesis \n\n \n\nThesis general introduction, in Chapter 2, aims to reveal the state of the art on antioxidant \n\nactivity of phenolic compounds from sweet potato and its food applications. The review was \n\nbased on the analysis of articles and patents published during 2003 to 2014, aided by text \n\nmining tools as hierarquical cluster analysis (HCA) and co-occurrence networks. \n\n \n\nIn Chapter 3, extraction parameters of phenolics with in vitro antioxidant activity from sweet \n\npotato vines were studied through a factorial design. Plant part, time and solvent acidification \n\nwere the factors studied, while total phenolic content and different antioxidant activities assays \n\nwere the responses for design evaluation. Statistical analyses were based on analysis of variance \n\n(ANOVA), post-hoc tests and principal components analysis (PCA).  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n8 \n\n \n\nIn Chapter 4, the effect of nine variables identified as relevant in previous studies on phenolics \n\nextraction were combined in a twelve run Plackett\u2013Burman design to screen for the key factors. \n\nStatistical tools as ANOVA and regression analysis evaluated significant main effects and two \n\nfactors interactions, respectively. Total phenolic content (TPC) and ferric reducing activity \n\npower (FRAP) assays were determined to evaluate the different runs.  \n\n \n\nThe aqueous extraction of phenolics with radical scavenging activity from sweet potato peels \n\nwas modelled and optimized in Chapter 5. Solvent: solid ratio, time and temperature were \n\nvaried according to a Central Composite Design, with total phenolic content and three in vitro \n\nantioxidant assays as responses. Response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural \n\nnetwork (ANN) methodologies were used for data analysis.  \n\n \n\nIn Chapter 6, a functional beverage benchtop prototype related to oxidative stress protection \n\nwas developed. The three formula components, sweet potato peel water extract, sweet potato \n\nleaves water extract and honey solution were varied though a mixture design. Formulation \n\nmodelling and optimization was performed by regression analysis and ANN,  \n\n \n\nFinally, general conclusions were presented in Chapter 7. \n\n \n\nThe work plan of the thesis was presented in Table 1.1. \n\n\n\nChapter 1 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n9 \n\n \n\nTable 1.1.

The \n\ndocuments on antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from the different plant parts \u2013 tuber, \n\nleaf, stem, vine and also cell line and processing waste \u2013 were selected for the period 2003-\n\n2014 from Web of Science\u2122 and ESPACENET databases. SP articles presented a demarked \n\ntrend towards preclinical studies and new foods that did not include SPP or SPL. DPPH method \n\nwas the in vitro antioxidant activity assay most used and hydroxycinnamic acids and \n\nanthocyanins were the phenolic compounds more analysed. Enhancement of antioxidant \n\ndefence and anticancer were health benefits verified by clinical trials for SPL while studies on \n\npeel were absent. Among the food applications studied in articles, flour/powder was the most \n\nstudied for tuber, leaf and peel. Beverage and extract were the top patented foods for tuber and \n\nleaf, respectively. Text mining applied to abstracts revealed main themes. The development of \n\nnew food products as beverages using design of experiment tools will reduce the knowledge \n\ngaps on SP leaves and specially peels and their valorisation into food application with health \n\nbenefits.  \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Sweet potato peels; sweet potato leaves; antioxidant activity; phenolic compounds; \n\nfood applications, health benefits, text mining. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n16 \n\n \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nSweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) ranked as 14th top commodity by quantity-wise production. \n\nIn 2013 (FAOSTAT, 2014),being a favourite staple of many cultures it is an ingredient in many \n\nethnic cuisine (Huntrods, 2013). Although sweet potato (SP) tuber is most commonly \n\nconsumed in the Western part of the world, their leaves consumed primarily in the islands of \n\nthe Pacific Ocean and in Asian and African countries, are decidedly rich in nutrients and \n\nfunctional compounds (Johnson &amp; Pace, 2010). Peels are one of the major wastes generated \n\nduring processing of sweet potato with currently little market value (Maloney, Truong, &amp; Allen, \n\n2012). The peeling step required in many SP tuber processing methods can lead to losses up to \n\n29 % and 17 % for abrasive and manual peeling respectively (Oladejo, 2011). Thus, SP peels \n\nand leaves are residues that should be included in the drive for recycling agro wastes as peels \n\ninto value added products (Peschel et al., 2006). SP peels possessed high levels of phenolics \n\n(Zhu, Cai, Yang, Ke, &amp; Corke, 2010) that can reach almost three times more antioxidant \n\nactivity than the other plant tissues (Cevallos-Casals &amp; Cisneros-Zevallos, 2001). Similarly, \n\npolyphenolic compounds from SP leaves were biologically active and presented physiological \n\nfunctions which may be helpful for maintaining and promoting human health (Islam, 2006). \n\nThus, the development of food application with health benefits related to the antioxidant \n\nactivity of phenolic compounds from SP peels and leaves are valuable research line both of \n\nacademic and industrial interests. There have been reviews on sweet potato tuber and leaf on \n\nduring the period of study. In 2007, (Bovell-Benjamin, 2007) highlighted sweet potato \n\nutilization, and its potential as value?added products in human food systems. It pointed out that \n\na multidisciplinary, integrated research and developmental activities, from production to \n\nprocessing technologies, were need to explore SP potential value?added products. Panda &amp; \n\nSonkamble (2012) reviewed the phytochemical constituents and pharmacological activities of \n\nSP where the peel was indicated as containing high levels of polyphenols such as anthocyanins \n\nand phenolic acids. Health benefits as antioxidant, antidiabetic, wound healing, anti-ulcer, \n\nantibacterial and anti-mutagenic were listed. Finally, Mohanraj &amp; Sivasankar (2014) covered \n\nthe health benefits, phytochemical composition and medicinal properties of SP, among other \n\ntopics, to demonstrate their potential as a medicinal food. Regarding leaf, Islam (2006) in his \n\nreview highlighted the presence of higher amounts of polyphenolics compared with the major \n\ncommercial vegetables. Significant medicinal value was already attributed to biologically \n\nactive anthocyanins and phenolic acids as they showed physiological functions which may be \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n17 \n\n \n\nhelpful for maintaining and promoting human health. The benefits of radical scavenging \n\nactivity, antimutagenic activity, anticancer, antidiabetes, and antibacterial activity were also \n\nlisted (Islam, 2006). In 2010, Johnson &amp; Pace summarised the bioactive compounds in SP \n\nleaves that played a vital role in health promotion by improving immune function, reducing \n\noxidative stress and free radical damage, reducing cardiovascular disease risk and suppressing \n\ncancer cell growth. The ability of antioxidants from SP leaves to reduce the risks associated \n\nwith disease is mediated by their ability to promote more favourable antioxidant status, free \n\nradical scavenging capacities, and thwart processes involved in disease pathogenesis (Johnson \n\n&amp; Pace, 2010). It clearly concluded that promoting the consumption of sweet potato leaves \n\nwarrants further and more intensive research investigation related to reduce the prevalence of \n\nchronic diseases (Johnson &amp; Pace, 2010). Several foods were enumerated as a source for \n\nbeneficial polyphenolic compounds. Frozen products and beverages are available in the market \n\nin some countries for a long time. Considerable progress has been made in diversifying usage \n\nof the SP for alternative foods as fries, chips, flakes, yogurt, as well as juices or weight loss \n\nsnacks (Barnes &amp; Sanders, 2012). Innovative applications such as ice-cream (Gurgel, Farias, \n\nFarias, &amp; Moreira, 2011) and non-carbonated drink (Wireko-Manu, Ellis, &amp; Oduro, 2010) were \n\nstudied in an academic context. Tea, noodles, breads, confectioneries and nutritional \n\nsupplement were food applications previously mentioned for SP leaves (Islam, 2006). In 2006, \n\nproducts as dry powder for juice, paste, ice cream were in development by cooperation between \n\nuniversities and food companies. The development of SP alternative foods was predicted to \n\ncontinue its upward climb trend as consumers are more conscious about their health (Barnes &amp; \n\nSanders, 2012). The development of functional foods is a multistage process where the \n\ncommencing stages involve the translation of an essential concept often originated from \n\nacademic research into a prototype (Jones &amp; Jew, 2007). Although, there are available some \n\nreviews on the phytochemical composition and health benefits of sweet potato tuber and leaf, \n\nthe health benefits specifically related to the antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds in the \n\ndifferent food applications were not focused. In addition, a framework for the valorisation of \n\nagro wastes through the development of functional foods requires the identification of \n\nknowledge gaps to favour early product prototypes. To gain insight on trend and state of the art \n\non food applications with health benefits from antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from \n\nsweet potato, a literature and patent review for the period 2003 -2013 was performed and \n\nanalysed by plant part. Text mining tools as co-word clustering is a powerful method for \n\nliterature-review and knowledge discovery by exploring the co-occurrence and co-absence of \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n18 \n\n \n\nkey words that appear in the titles or abstracts of texts (Stegmann &amp; Grohmann, 2003). \n\nAdditionally, network analysis shows the relationship among words as a visual network and \n\ntherefore assists the analyser in intuitively comprehending the overall structure of a document \n\ndatabase (Yoon &amp; Park, 2004). The objective of this review was to analyse the type of studies, \n\nantioxidant assays, phenolic compounds, statistical analysis, health benefits and food \n\napplications for the different SP plant parts in the period 2003 -2014. Together with the analysis \n\nof the state of the art pictured by text mining tools, relevant research lines for the valorisation \n\nof SP peels and leaves into food applications with health benefits will be identified.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. Materials and Methods  \n\n \n\nA qualitative approach was taken to analyse the selected documents by summarizing \n\ninformation in tables, graphics and applying text-mining tools. \n\n \n\n2.2.1. Databases \n\n \n\nA search on ISI Web of Knowledge (http://wokinfo.com/) and ESPACENET \n\n(http://worldwide.espacenet.com/#) electronic databases for the period 2003-2014 was \n\nperformed to gather relevant documents on topic of this study. The databases Web of \n\nScienceTM Core Collection, Current Contents Connect\u00ae, MEDLINE\u00ae and SciELO Citation \n\nIndex were selected for articles search. For patents, previous tests presented only one and zero \n\nresults in the WIPO and European collection, respectively. Therefore, the worldwide collection \n\nof published application from 90 countries was chosen as database.  \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Selection of articles and patents \n\n \n\nFor the selection of articles, the first criteria used in the Web of Knowledge database was \n\ndocuments  with \u201csweet potato\u201d or \u201cIpomoea batatas\u201d in the title for the period 2003-2014. The \n\nfollowing filters were included: \u201cscience and technology\u201d for the research domain, \u201cfood \n\nscience and technology\u201d for the research area and \u201carticles\u201d (review were excluded) for the \n\ndocument type. The first collection of documents were selected by the presence of the terms \n\n\u201cphenol*\u201d, \u201cantho*\u201d, \u201cflavon*\u201d, \u201cantiox*\u201d and/or \u201cscaveng*\u201d in document topic. This \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n19 \n\n \n\ncollection was narrowed by two reviews to the theme antioxidant activity and/or phenolic \n\ncomposition of sweet potato plant. Finally, when essential information was absent from the \n\narticle description and could not be acquired by contact with the corresponding authors, it was \n\nnot included in the review. Regarding the selection of patents, a search was performed in the \n\nESPACENET database for documents with \u201csweet potato\u201d or \u201cIpomea batatas\u201d in the title or \n\nin abstract with publication date in the range 01/01/2003 to 31/12/2014 (20030101-20141231). \n\nPatents published in the field that presented the terms \u201cphenol*\u201d, \u201cantho*\u201d, \u201cflavon*\u201d, \n\n\u201cantiox*\u201d and/or \u201cscaveng*\u201d in their abstract were selected. A patent was included in the review \n\nwhen the invention was related to a food application with antioxidant activity and/or phenolic \n\ncomposition. \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Documents analysis \n\n \n\n2.2.3.1. Traditional approach \n\n \n\nThe body of information gathered from the selected documents were synthetized into tables \n\n(Supplementary data). Articles were classified by SP plant part (tuber, leaf, stem, vine, peel, \n\ncell line and waste) on variety (purple and not purple), type of study, antioxidant activity assays, \n\nphenolic compounds, statistical analysis, health benefits and food applications. For patents, \n\ndocuments categorization by the different SP plant parts was made for variety and food \n\napplications. \n\n \n\n2.2.3.2. Text mining \n\n \n\nThe free text mining software tool KH coder (http://sourceforge.net/projects/khc/) was used to \n\nperform an automatic text mining of articles and patents abstracts. Text pre-processing was \n\ndone by breaking sentences into component parts of speech (parsing), removal of common \n\nwords with little significance (stop words) and aggregation of similar words (stemming or \n\nlemming). Only nouns and adjectives were used for analysis and both term frequency and \n\ndocument frequency were adjusted so 27 to 31 words were used for graphical representation. \n\nA Hierarquical cluster analysis (HCA) using the Ward method and Jaccard distance with \n\nautomatic detection of the number of clusters was applied to nouns and adjectives to form \n\ngroups of words that summarize documents major themes. Co-occurrence networks were built \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n20 \n\n \n\nto pattern high-frequency words occurring together and identify content communities. Nodes \n\nsize was proportional to respective word frequency and links (edges) thickness was determined \n\nby Jaccard coefficient. Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm was used to determine the position of \n\nthe nodes in the network layout while community detection was performed using the function \n\n\"edge.betweenness.community\u201d from the \"igraph\" package of R.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3. Results and discussion \n\n \n\nFood applications and health benefits related to antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds \n\nfrom SP were analyzed by plant part. The plant parts considered were tuber, leaf, stem, vine \n\nand peel. Due to results from documents analysis, cell line and processing waste were also \n\nconsidered and named as plant part. The following features were analyzed: types of studies, \n\nantioxidant activity assays, phenolic compounds, statistical analysis, health benefits and food \n\napplications. Text mining tools applied to articles and patents abstracts intended to picture the \n\nmain results for the period 2003-2014 on antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from SP. \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Selection of documents \n\n \n\nA search on article titles with \u201csweet potato\u201d or \u201cIpomoea batatas\u201d in the Web of Science\u2122 \n\nCore Collection for the period 2003-2014 in the science and technology domain and food \n\nscience and technology research area delivered 443 results. When refined to the topic terms \n\n\u201cphenol*\u201d, \u201cantho*\u201d, \u201cflavon*\u201d, \u201cantiox*\u201d or \u201cscaveng*\u201d a total of 432 different articles was \n\nobtained. Thus, most of the studies for the food science and technology research area addressed \n\nSP phenolic compounds or antioxidant activity. The abstract of these articles was verified for \n\nrelevance, when one of the refining topic terms was present in the article abstract, it was \n\nincluded in the review. The final selection of articles on phenolic compounds with antioxidant \n\nactivity from SP totalized 122 articles (Table 2.1.). \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n21 \n\n \n\nTable 2.1.

When the search was narrowed by including the \n\npresence of the terms \u201cphenol*\u201d, \u201cantho*\u201d, \u201cflavon*\u201d, \u201cantiox*\u201d or \u201cscaveng*\u201d in the title or \n\nabstract, it delivered 9, 137, 19, 76 and 11 results, respectively. Combined, a total of 217 \n\ndifferent patents were obtained. After verification if invention was related to a food application \n\nby analyzing abstract content, patents were reduced to 170 documents (Table 2.2.). Combined, \n\narticles and patents formed a collection of 292 documents with the following main features: a) \n\n58 % of the documents were patents; b) 71 % of the documents were published in the period \n\n2010-2013; c) 68 % of the documents were on the purple variety and d) tuber was the subject \n\nof 79 % of the documents, in opposition to the other forms (leaf, stem, vine, peel, cell line, or \n\nprocessing waste) (Figure 2.1). The time series map of articles date of publication showed a \n\none step-profile with an average of 7 articles per year for the period 2003 to 2009 (Figure 2.2). \n\nA growth to an average of 16 articles per year was observed to the period 2010 to1013 followed \n\nby a decrease to 10 articles published in 2014. Patents presented a different time profile in \n\ncomparison to articles. Until 2010, an average of 6 patents were published per year. The number \n\nof patents on sweet potato has increased since 2011, with a higher growth (70 %) from 2013 to \n\n2014. \n\n \n\n2.3.1.2. SP Articles \n\n \n\nThe 122 selected articles for this review were published in 58 different journals, where 4 - \n\nJournal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Food Chemistry, International Journal of Food \n\nScience and Technology and Food Science and Technology Research - reached 33 % in number. \n\nArticles were classified by plant part and variety as presented in Supplementary Table S2.1. As \n\ndepicted in Figure 2.3, tuber presented the highest number of papers both on the purple and \n\nnon-purple variety. SP leaf was the second most studied plant part with more articles than stem, \n\nvine, peel, cell line and processing waste together. Although SP leaves are considered a waste \n\nin many parts of the world, they are consumed in Asia as a leafy vegetable and therefore gaining \n\nhigh research attention. All the SP plant parts with exception of the tuber presented more \n\narticles on the non-purple varieties. The purple variety was mostly studied by research centers \n\nfrom China that presented the highest number of papers (18), followed by Korea (14).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n23 \n\n \n\nTable 2.2.

Thus, antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds by SP plant part \n\nhad the following order regarding the number or articles: tuber>>leaf>>peel. Studies on SP \n\npeel received much less attention than tuber of leaf. To respond to the growing interest of agro- \n\nand food industries in value added recycling (Peschel et al., 2006), there is a need for research \n\non antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from SP leaves but specially peels. This could \n\ncontribute to overcome this knowledge gap and promote to the valorization of both peels and \n\nleaves into food applications with health benefits.  \n\n \n\n2.3.1.2. SP Patents \n\n \n\nThe 170 selected patents were predominantly from China (72 %) with Qingdao Agricultural \n\nUniversity as the top applicant (11 patents). The classification of the selected patents by plant \n\npart and variety was presented in Supplementary Table S2.2. The number of patents on \n\nantioxidant activity of phenolic  compounds from SP was concentrated on the purple variety \n\n(79 %) and on the tuber plant part (91 %) (Figure 2.5). Inventions with SP leaf or peel occurred \n\nin a very small scale. As occurred in articles, leaf (alone or combined with stem) was the second \n\nplant part most mentioned in patents.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5. Distribution of SP patents by variety and plant parts for the period 2003-2014. \n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n28 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6. Time series map of SP patents by A) variety and b) plant parts for the period 2003 \nto 2014. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn addition, inventions including peels were scare for the period 2003-2014. The time series \n\nmap of patent publication date showed that inventions including the purple variety supplanted \n\nthe non-purple varieties in 2006, with a large growth from 2010 to 2014 (Figure 2.6A). Tuber \n\npresented a similar trend than the purple variety due to their prevalence on SP patents (Figure \n\n2.6B). Therefore, research on SP peels and leaves for food applications have potential to be \n\nconsidered an invention and protected by patent registration. As the strategy of combining \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n29 \n\n \n\ndifferent SP plant parts presented a low intensity in the period of time studied, it could be \n\nundertaken in future developments of value added products. \n\n \n\n2.3.2. Types of study of SP articles \n\n \n\nArticles on antioxidant activity of phenolic compound from sweet potato were classified into \n\nthirteen different types of study (Supplementary Table S2.3). More than one type of study or \n\nplant part could be attributed to a paper in accordance to their objectives. For SP tuber, the top \n\nfour types of study were in decreasing order: new food, preclinical (animal), processing method \n\nand cultivar/genotype/variety (Figure 2.7A). Leaf presented a different order for the type of \n\nstudies, namely cultivar/genotype/variety > preclinical (animal) > plant part = clinical = \n\nproduction cultivation (Figure 2.7B). Tuber presented more preclinical (animal) studies than \n\nleaf and an inverse order was observed for clinical studies. Regarding peels, papers were on the \n\nphenolic composition, processing methods and processing variables effects on antioxidant \n\nactivity. SP processing waste (2 papers) was the only plant part beside tuber that had articles \n\non new food.  \n\nThe distribution in time of the different types of studies showed that until 2009 there was no \n\npredominance of any type of study (Figure 2.8). However, from 2010 until 2013, the main types \n\nidentified previously appeared markedly. Preclinical (animal) studies reached 6 articles both in \n\n2010 and 2013 (Figure 2.8A). An increase in new food studies was also observed for the period \n\n2012-2014. Studies on the effect of processing variables on SP antioxidant activity reach 5 \n\narticles in 20110 while 4 articles on formulation studies were published in 2004 (Figure 2.8B). \n\nTherefore, for the late period 2003-2014.there was a demarked trend towards preclinical studies \n\nfollowed by research on new foods related to antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from \n\nSP. The effect of processing methods and phenolic compounds represented a steady or positive \n\ntrend from 2013 to 2014. \n\nThe knowledge gap was higher for SP peel than for leaves. Research on new foods for peels \n\nand leaves combined with processing variables studies may benefit from the body of knowledge \n\nalready built for the tuber plant part. In addition, the inclusion of optimization and formulation \n\nmay accelerate the development of food application with health benefits based on SP peels and \n\nleaves.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n30 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7.

Antioxidant activity assays used in SP articles \n\n \n\nThe antioxidant activity results from the collection of articles related to phenolic compound \n\nfrom sweet potato were distributed by fourteen in vitro antioxidant assays and nine in vivo \n\nassays (Supplementary Table S2.4). Frequently, more than one assay was used in a paper. For \n\nSP tuber, the in vitro assay 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging activity was \n\npredominant, with ferric reducing-antioxidant power (FRAP) assay as the second most used \n\nassay (Figure 2.9A). DPPH assay was also the most frequent used method for most of SP plant \n\nparts (Figure 2.9B) and this was also observed by Alam et al. (2013). DPPH is often included \n\nin antioxidant studies as it is more rapid, simple and inexpensive when compared to other free \n\nradical scavenging methods. \n\nRegarding in vivo antioxidant estimation for the tuber plant part, lipid peroxidation assay (LPO) \n\nwas the most used for tuber followed by reduced glutathione (GSH) estimation. The decreasing \n\norder for in vitro antioxidant methods used to study SP leaf were DPPH, RP, thiobarbituric acid \n\nmethod (TBA) and FRAP (Figure 2.9B). The antioxidant activity of SP peels was only \n\npublished using the FRAP method so future research should include other methods as DPPH \n\nand RP for comparison purposes with other SP plant parts. The time series map of articles \n\npublication dates did not add significant information so it was not presented here. Therefore, \n\nthere it was identified a knowledge gap between SP leaf and peel regarding in vitro antioxidant \n\nactivities and also between DPPH assay and the other in vitro assays.  \n\n \n\n2.3.4. Phenolic compounds determined in SP articles \n\n \n\nThe phenolic composition of the different SP plant parts published in the selected articles was \n\ndivided into two categories (Supplementary Table S2.5). Three spectrophotometric methods \n\nwere considered for the global phenolic composition while individual compounds, obtained by \n\nmethodologies as HPLC or LC, were grouped in four classes. The spectrophotometric methods \n\nconsidered were: total phenolic compounds (TPC), total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA) and \n\ntotal flavonoid content (TFC). TPC and TMA results were more frequent for SP tuber while \n\nTFC was used in lesser extent (Figure 2.10A).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n32 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8.

More than one type \nof study could be attributed to an article. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9. Stacked bar chart of SP articles by antioxidant assay for the period 2003-2014 for \nA) tuber and B) other plant parts (leaf, stem, vine, peel, cell line and waste). More than one \nassay could be attributed to an article. See Table S2.4 for assays abbreviations. \n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n34 \n\n \n\nFor leaves, the decreasing order of articles was TPC > TFC > TMA (Figure 2.10B). This order \n\nwas different than the observed for the tuber as a result of the less number of articles for the \n\npurple variety for leaf so anthocyanin content was not as much determined. The individual \n\ncompounds were grouped into hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, flavonoids, \n\nflavonols and anthocyanins. Tuber presented more articles on anthocyanins composition than \n\nhydroxycinnamic acids, and no results for the other compounds groups were identified ((Figure \n\n2.10A). The other plant parts together covered the five groups of individual compounds and \n\nhydroxycinnamic acids were analysed for all the plant parts (Figure 2.10B). There was more \n\narticles with results on hydroxycinnamic acids from SP leaf followed by flavonols. \n\nInterestingly, stem was the third plant part with more results published while peel had only \n\narticles on TPC and hydroxycinnamic acids. Time series map of articles publication dates did \n\nnot add significant information so it was not considered. Thus, there was a higher knowledge \n\ngap on phenolic compounds of SP peel than leaf that should be reduced by future research on \n\nthe development of food applications with health benefits. \n\n \n\n2.3.5. Statistical analysis used in SP articles \n\n \n\nThe statistical analysis used to examine the results of articles antioxidant activity of phenolic \n\ncompounds from sweet potato were summarized into fifteen tools (Supplementary Table S2.6). \n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA), Duncan's post hoc test followed by Tukey\u2019s test and \n\ncorrelation analysis were the most used statistical analysis for tuber plant part (Figure 2.11A). \n\nThis resulted from the question of interest of articles was to evaluate whether one factor had a \n\nsignificant impact on the response variables. The usual procedure was to perform the analysis \n\nof variance to test whether the means of several groups are equal followed by post hoc tests to \n\ncheck the difference significance group by group. For SP leaf, analysis of variance, Student\u2019s t \n\ntest and correlation were the most used (Figure 2.11B).  \n\nAnalysis tools as principal component analysis, response surface methodology of factorial \n\ndesigns were absent or used in a reduced number of articles. Multivariate analysis tools, based \n\nupon statistics, provide a rigorous inferences from experimental data and an efficient and \n\neffective planning of experiments for product excellence (Joglekar &amp; May, 1987). The use of \n\ndesign of experiments and multivariate statistical tools for the development of food applications \n\nwith health benefits form SP leaf and peels will narrow this gap on statistical analysis. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n35 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10.

Health benefits listed in SP articles \n\n \n\nThe health benefits related to antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds from sweet potato \n\nwere summarized from the clinical and preclinical (animal) publication (Supplementary Table \n\nS2.7). SP tuber and leaf were the only plant parts used and leaf presented more clinical studies \n\nthan tuber. In general, benefits of antioxidant activity were linked to the reduction of oxidative \n\nstress, anti-diabetic and anti-cancer functions and related to the brain and liver. Phenolic \n\ncompounds from SP tuber, mostly anthocyanin fractions, decreased oxidative stress, modulated \n\nantioxidative status, enhanced antioxidant defence,  reduced  DNA  oxidation, decrease pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokine secretion and presented cytoprotective activity against ?-radiation. \n\nAnticancer benefits included effects in preventing cancers namely colorectal cancer, growth \n\nsuppression of cancer cells and apoptosis in prostate cancer. Benefits for the liver include the \n\ndecrease the serum levels of biomarkers, attenuation of inflammatory response, attenuation of \n\noxidative stress induced by D-galactose, attenuation of dimethylnitrosamine-induced injury, \n\nprotection against tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP), protection on induced lipid accumulation \n\nand attenuates hepatic insulin resistance via blocking oxidative stress. Phenolic compounds via \n\nantioxidant activity imparted neuroprotection by attenuation of oxidative damage, amelioration \n\nof cognition deficits, and amelioration of inflammation in brain and also pretended enhancing \n\neffects in memory and spatial learning. Finally, SP tuber ameliorated diabetic disorders and \n\npresented anti-fatigue activity, and was also considered a treatment of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\nThey were active in reducing lipid oxidation and suppressing low-density lipoprotein oxidation. \n\nThe health benefits related to SP leaf were obtained by clinical studies were enhancement of \n\nantioxidant defence, anticancer activity, and reduction of lipid oxidation, of DNA oxidation \n\nand of inflammation. Health benefits as anti-fatigue, antidiabetic activity and treatment of \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease were established by animal testing. \n\nTuber presented studies distributed in the range of 2003 to 2014 while SP leaf studies were \n\npublished between 2007 and 2013 (Figure 2.12). There was no health benefits established for \n\nSP peel. Although the health benefits of peels could be inferred from its antioxidant activity \n\nand phenolic composition by comparison to the tuber, validation through clinical and \n\npreclinical (animal) studies will be necessary. The information regarding the health benefits in \n\nSP leaf should be tested for new food applications. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n38 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12.

Food applications in SP articles  \n\n \n\nFood applications in SP articles on antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds were registered \n\nin Supplementary Table S2.8. Articles were distributed by a total of twenty five different food \n\napplications where flour/powder was in majority. For tuber, anthocyanin extracts and extracts \n\nwere the second and third food applications, respectively (Figure 2.13A). Fermented (stems) \n\nand vinegar (from processing waste) were the only food applications not found for SP tuber. \n\nArticles that studied beverages based on SP tuber where in equal number as the boiling and as \n\nfresh products. Different home cooking preparations for tuber, as boiling, steaming, stir frying \n\n(saut\u00e9e), baked, frying, microwaving or roasted were already addressed, although in a reduced \n\nnumber. SP tuber presented different products in the beverage category, such as alcoholic \n\ndrinks (excluding wine), wine, nectar and a lactic acid beverage. Food applications for the other \n\nplant parts were much less miscellaneous than for the tuber with only eleven different products \n\n(Figure 2.13B). As for SP tuber, flour/powder was the most classified food type for leaf \n\nfollowed by extract. \n\nThe distribution in time of the different food applications was represented in Figure 2.14. \n\nGlobally, SP flour/powder was predominant over the over food application, with more number \n\nof studies in the period 2010 to 2013. A large increase in articles about the SP flour/powder \n\nform was observed from 2009 to 2010 but in 2014 number decreased abruptly. There was no \n\npositive trend for any food application from 2013 to 2014. In 2014, the food applications that \n\nwere more mentioned in articles were extract and anthocyanin extract. There is a lack of studies \n\non food applications for other SP plant parts than tuber or leaf. Research on applications for the \n\nvalorisation of SP wastes, a flour/powder or a beverage could benefits from knowledge \n\naccumulated for tuber. \n\n \n\n2.3.8. Food applications in SP patents \n\n \n\nFood applications of SP with antioxidant activity of phenolic compounds reported in patents \n\nwere summarized in Supplementary Table S2.9. The number of different products \u2013 43 \u2013 was \n\nhigher than the one obtained for articles. The product with more patents application for tuber \n\nwas a beverage followed by pasta (that including noodles products) (Figure 2.15A). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n40 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13.

As expected, the traditional home cooking preparations for tuber were absent in the \n\npatent food applications. The beverage food category comprised more different products for \n\npatents than for articles as juice, beer and liquor. SP tuber was also mentioned for healthy foods, \n\nfunctional foods and supplements. As observed for articles, patented food applications for the \n\nother SP plant parts were less miscellaneous than for tuber with only seven different products \n\n(Figure 2.15B). For SP leaf, extracts were the most patented food application followed by beer. \n\nThree products that were patented for leaf \u2013 essence, fiber and pickle \u2013 were absent in tuber. \n\nThe time series map of patents\u2019 date of publication was represented in Figure 2.16 for food \n\napplications with more than nine patents in the period 2003-2014. Until 2007 there were only \n\npublished 7 patents on phenolic compounds and/or antioxidant activity of SP. Beverages \n\npatents grew in number from 2007to 2011. In 2014, the food applications that presented a \n\npositive trend were healthy foods, pasta, flour/powder and beverage.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n42 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15.

Text mining \n\n \n\nHCA and co-occurrence analysis were performed on statistics obtained by text mining pre-\n\ntreatment of abstracts of selected articles and patents for the period 2003 to 2014. The words \n\nselected were nouns and adjectives with a minimum term and document frequencies of 23 for \n\narticles and 34 for patents Dendograms obtained by HCA revealed five word groups for both \n\narticles and patents and two major themes were considered based on words frequency. For \n\narticles abstracts, \u201csweet\u201d and \u201cpotato\u201d presented the closest similarity in Group 1 with higher \n\nterm frequencies (1st main theme) (Figure 2.17A). \u201cAcid\u201d was the word more related to \u201csweet \n\npotato\u201d within the group. This may be associated to the different phenolic compounds that did \n\nnot enter in the analysis due to the criteria applied to term and document frequencies. For the \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n44 \n\n \n\nsame reason, although \u201cphenolic\u201d ranked high in adjectives frequency (5th) the word did not \n\nenter in the representation. \u201cTotal content\u201d was next to \u201csweet potato\u201d and \u201cacid\u201d. The other \n\nwords in Group 1 group were \u201cantioxidant activity\u201d that were closely related to \u201cresult\u201d and \n\n\u201ceffect\u201d. The second group of words with higher frequencies (2nd main theme) was formed by \n\n\u201canthocyanin\u201d, \u201cpurple\u201d, level\u201d, \u201cconcentration\u201d and \u201ctreatment\u201d (Group 2). Patents \n\ndendogram presented a group of words (Group 1) with much higher frequencies than the others \n\n(Figure 2.17B). \u201cPurple sweet potato\u201d, \u201canthocyanins\u201d and \u201craw material\u201d were the central \n\nsubject of patents (1st main theme). The 2nd main theme was connected to patent food \n\napplications namely \u201cfood\u201d, \u201cpowder\u201d, \u201cweight\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d.  \n\nCo-occurrence networks patterns high-frequency words occurring together and identify content \n\ncommunities. Words are depicted as nodes with a size proportional to their frequency in the \n\ndocuments. Nodes are linked by edges when they occur together and their thickness is \n\nproportional to the strength of co-occurrence between them. For articles abstracts, three content \n\ncommunities were detected (Figure 2.18A). The community that included the words \u201csweet\u201d \n\nand \u201cpotato\u201d was located at the centre of the network (number 1). The words \u201ctotal\u201d, \u201cacid\u201d, \n\n\u201cphenolic\u201d and \u201ccontent\u201d were located closely in this group and presented high co-occurrence. \n\nThe words \u201cactivity\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d belonged to the \u201csweet potato\u201d group but \u201cantioxidant\u201d and \n\n\u201cresults\u201d formed a small community on their own (number 2) with several links to core group. \n\n\u201cPurple\u201d and \u201canthocyanin\u201d made a community (number 3) that also was linked by several \n\nedges to words of the main group. \u201cDPPH\u201d was a satellite node only linked to the word \n\n\u201cactivity\u201d. The co-occurrence network for patents abstracts presented a different configuration \n\nthan the one built for articles (Figure 2.18B). Four communities were identified. \u201cPurple\u201d, \n\n\u201csweet\u201d and \u201cpotato\u201d belonged to the larger community (number 1) and were closely located \n\nand strongly linked. The words \u201craw\u201d, \u201cmaterial\u201d, \u201ceffect\u201d, \u201cweight\u201d and \u201cpowder\u201d also \n\nbelonged to this community. All the other three communities in the network were linked to the \n\n\u201cpurple sweet potato\u201d community but not among each other. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n45 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.17.

Conclusions \n\n \n\nFrom the main food applications found in articles and patents for the period 2003-2014, the \n\ndevelopment of a flour/powder or a beverage could benefit from the knowledge already built \n\nfor the tuber. As the strategy of combining different SP plant parts presented a low intensity in \n\nthe period of time studied, it could be undertaken in future research. Rather than using result \n\nmeans comparison tools as verified for the tuber, the use of design of experiments and \n\nmultivariate statistical tools during new food development could narrow efficiently the \n\nknowledge gap found for peels and leaves. Design responses should include DPPH assay \n\ncombined with other in vitro antioxidant assays and the determination of phenolic compounds \n\nby spectrophotometric methods as well the content of individual anthocyanins and \n\nhydroxycinnamic acids. These results could shape further research on health benefits, expected \n\nto be related to the reduction of oxidative stress and improvement of brain and liver functions. \n\nAlthough these health benefits could be inferred from the antioxidant activity and phenolic \n\ncomposition of peels and leaves by comparison to the tuber, validation through clinical and \n\npreclinical (animal) studies will be necessary. In addition, text mining applied only to abstract \n\ntexts revealed the main research features of articles and claims of patents on antioxidant activity \n\nof phenolic compounds of sweet potato. Dendograms and co-occurrence networks form text \n\nmining analysis may be useful to compare future research lines patterns and trends. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.5. References \n\n \nAhmed, M., Akter, M.

For the first time, \n\ntotal antioxidant activity (TAA), reducing power (RP), ferric-reducing antioxidant power \n\n(FRAP) and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) antioxidant activities from European \n\nsweet potato vines holding a Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) were studied through a \n\nfactorial design. Plant part was the main influential factor followed by solvent acidification. \n\nPrincipal component analysis revealed total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, FRAP \n\nand RP assays more related to sample differences (stems or leaves) and DPPH to extraction \n\nconditions, namely solvent acidification. The in vitro antioxidant activities of leaves were 1.25 \n\ng AAE/100 g dw for TAA and 50.8 g GAE/100 g dw for RP. DPPH scavenging activity was \n\nhigher than FRAP (i.e., 58.6 and 29.3 and mM Trolox/g dw, respectively). Stems results were \n\n1.3 to 9.2 times lower than leaves. These outcomes confirmed SP leaves a potential resource of \n\nantioxidants in the human diet that may add supplementary value to PGI agriculture products. \n\n \n\n \n\nPractical application \n\nVines, especially leaves, from PGI sweet potatoes could be advantageously used as a natural \n\nsource of antioxidants, with potential to be used as a food in the diet. Focus on sweet potato of \n\nEuropean origin may contribute to increase interest on its cultivation and consumption. In \n\naddition, insights on the potential added value present in Protected Geographic Indication (PGI) \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n88 \n\n \n\nagriculture products may enhance protected demonization turnover for producers. Industries \n\nthat pursuit food with functional applications may consider sweet potato vines in their new \n\nproduct development processes, aiming for health benefits.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nConsumer demand for foods that contain health-promoting components beyond traditional \n\nnutrients has stove interest in functional foods (Carvalho et al. 2006, 2010). Sweet potato (SP) \n\n(Ipomoea batatas L. Lam.) can be considered per se a functional food due to its appreciable \n\namounts of biological active compounds, such as polyphenols. It is a traditional food in many \n\ncountries where not only tubers but also vines, raw or cooked, are also commonly consumed \n\n(Lako et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2009; Isabelle et al. 2010). Polyphenols present in SP leaves \n\nwere related to antioxidative/radical scavenging activity physiological functions (Islam et al. \n\n2002) that could prevent or moderate oxidative stress-related diseases. They showed the highest \n\npolyphenol content (5.35 g gallic acid equivalent/100 g dw) among 12 vegetables, near twice \n\nthe content of purslane (Portulaca oleraceae) and three times of green onions (Allium \n\nfistulosum) (Huang et al. 2009). Phenolic compounds associated with antioxidant activity of SP \n\nleaf extracts are flavonoids (Chu et al. 2000; Islam et al. 2002) and phenolic acids (Islam 2006; \n\nTruong et al. 2007). High in vitro antioxidant activity of SP leaves correlates with these \n\ncompounds, with several potential food applications (Islam 2006). Extraction conditions are a \n\nkey parameter in the determination of antioxidant activity. Besides solid\u2013solvent ratio and \n\ntemperature, time of contact and pH can affect the efficiency extraction of antioxidants, and it \n\nis relevant to study their main effects and interactions. SP origin in published studies is mostly \n\nfrom Asia, which in 2009 cultivated 82 % of total world production, Africa and America. To \n\nour knowledge, no studies were published on the antioxidant activity of SP leaves from Europe. \n\nAlthough this region produced only 0.06 % of world crop, mainly at the Iberia Peninsula, it \n\nwas the second best-performing region in culture yield (FAOSTAT 2009). In addition, vines \n\nfrom SP with Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) have not been studies yet. The European \n\nUnion PGI status is used to denote agricultural products and foods closely linked to a \n\ngeographical area, where they are produced and/or processed and/or prepared (European \n\nCommission Agriculture and Rural Development 2010). As SP from Portugal has this \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n89 \n\n \n\ndenomination, the vines used in this study have two novelty features, Europe origin and PGI \n\nstatus. The objectives of the present study were to study antioxidant activity of vines of SP with \n\na European PGI denomination and analyze the effects of vine part, time and solvent. Correlation \n\nbetween total phenolic content and antioxidant activities was also assed. These results may \n\ncontribute to raise interest in SP vines produced in Europe and its potential for use as a \n\nfunctional food or ingredient. In addition, it may signal extra value present in PGI agriculture \n\nproducts for turnover improvement. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n3.2.1. Reagents \n\n \n\nAluminum chloride (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), ammonium molybdate (Panreac, \n\nBarcelona, Spain), ascorbic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), 2,2-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl \n\n(DPPH) (Calbiochem, Nottingham, U.K.), ferric chloride (Merck), Folin\u2013Ciocalteau reagent \n\n(Merck), gallic acid (Fluka, St. Louis, MO), glacial acetic acid (BDH-Prolabo, West Chester, \n\nPA), hydrochloric acid (Riedel, Seelze, Germany), methanol (BDH-Prolabo), potassium \n\nferricyanide (Merck), quercetin (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA), sodium acetate (Merck), sodium \n\nphosphate (Merck), sodium carbonate (Merck), sulfuric acid (Merck), trichloroacetic acid \n\n(BDH-Prolabo), 2,4,6-tripyridyl-2-trizine (TPTZ) (Sigma), Trolox (Sigma Aldrich, Poole, \n\nU.K.), dipotassium hydrogen phosphate (Merck) and potassium dihydrogen phosphate \n\n(Merck). \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Equipment \n\n \n\nAll determinations are spectrophotometric, and absorbance readings were made in an Ultrospec \n\n1100 pro-UV/visible spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire, \n\nU.K.). \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Plant Material \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n90 \n\n \n\nPlant material was collected from SP plants (Lira variety) from Aljezur (Portugal) that holds a \n\nPGI status (European Union 2008). SP vines used as propagation material were collected at an \n\nearly morning of July and kept in an isothermal container during transport to the laboratory \n\nwithin 1.5 h. Vines had green-purple stems and stalks, and green glabrous with entire shape \n\nleaves. Each vine was cut into three equal parts; and leaves, stalks and stems were cut after \n\nforming three groups: the upper (younger), middle and bottom sections of the vine. The plant \n\nmaterial used in this study was from the bottom section, where stem length was between 15 \n\nand 38 cm, average of 25 cm, with two to six leaves, average of four. Leaves and stems were \n\nstored in open trays at 10C and relative humidity of 95 % (S600 PLH phitoclim, Aralab, Rio \n\nde Mouro, Portugal) for 48 h. Whole leaves and stems were cut in portions of 1.5 cm \n\napproximately, dried in monolayer regime at 60C in a Binder BD 53 incubator (Binder, \n\nTuttilgen, Germany) for 24 h and 48 h, respectively. After cooling in an exsiccator, samples \n\nwere grounded to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle, and stored in sealed glass tubes at \n\n4C until analysis. Moisture loss during drying was of 76.49 \u00b1 3.09 and 80.07 \u00b1 0.04 % for \n\nleaves and stems, respectively. \n\n \n\n3.2.4. Extraction of Antioxidants \n\n \n\nPlant extracts were prepared by the addition of 1 mL of 80 % aqueous methanol to 0.05 g of \n\ndried plant material; tubes were sealed, involved in aluminum foil, vortexed and kept in an \n\norbital shaker (Edmund Buhler Gmg H-Ks 15, Hechingen, Germany) at a 45\u00b0 angle for 24 h at \n\n37C. The same conditions of extraction were used in the second and third extractions, after \n\ntubes were centrifuged (Hettich Universal 320, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 3,000 \u00a5 g for 10 min. \n\nSolvent was decanted, and 0.75 mL of fresh solvent was added to plant material. The volume \n\nof solvent used per extraction experiment was collected in glass tubes, filtered and diluted to a \n\nfinal volume of 5 mL of extract, with solid: solvent ratio of 1:100. Extracts were hold at 4 \u00baC \n\nuntil analysis. \n\n \n\n3.2.5. Total Phenolic Content and Total Flavonoid Content \n\n \n\nTotal phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) were determined according to \n\nmethods described by Huang et al. (2006), with slight modifications. A calibration curve of \n\ngallic acid in the range of 12.5\u2013100 mg/mL (r2 = 0.995) was constructed, and the TPC was \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n91 \n\n \n\nexpressed as g gallic acid equivalent (GAE) in 100 g of dried material. TFC was quantified \n\nfrom a standard calibration curve that was constructed in the range of 7\u201355 g/mL of quercetin \n\n(r2 = 0.9991), and results were expressed in g of quercetin equivalent (QE) by 100 g of dry \n\nweight. \n\n \n\n2.3.6. Antioxidant Activity \n\n \n\nFour different methods were used to evaluate antioxidant activity. Total antioxidant activity \n\n(TAA) was assayed by phosphomolybdenum method according to Prieto et al. (1999), with \n\nslight modifications. A linear calibration curve for acid ascorbic in the range of 28\u2013201 mg/mL \n\n(r2 = 0.9992) was constructed, and results were expressed as g of ascorbic acid equivalent \n\n(AAE) in 100 g of dry material. Reducing power (RP) determination was made by ferricyanide \n\nmethod described by Huang et al. (2010), with minor modifications. A calibration curve for \n\nacid gallic was made at the range of 200 and 540 mg/mL of gallic acid, with a regression \n\ncoefficient of 0.9997, and results were expressed in g GAE per 100 g of dried material. \n\nThe method described by Benzie and Strain (1996) was used the determination of ferric-\n\nreducing antioxidant power (FRAP), with some modifications. An aliquot of 200 mL was added \n\nto 3 mL of FRAP reagent (buffer acetate 300 mM, pH 3.6; 40 mM of HCl; 10 mM of TPTZ \n\nand 20 mM ferric chloride). After the mixture stood at 20C for 4 min in the dark, the absorbance \n\nat 593 nm was measured against a blank. A calibration curve for Trolox was made in the range \n\nof 50 and 175 mM, with a regression coefficient of 0.9991 (data not shown), and results were \n\nexpressed in mM Trolox equivalent (TE) per gram of dry weight. \n\nFree radical DPPH scavenging capacity was determined by the method of Brand-Williams et \n\nal. (1995), where 2 mL of 0.15 mM DPPH was added to 100 mL of extract (at adequate \n\ndilutions) or Trolox. Tubes were sealed, vortexed and incubated in the dark at room temperature \n\nduring 30 min. Absorbance was measured at 517 nm. A calibration curve for Trolox was made \n\nin the range of 100 and 800 mM, with a regression coefficient of 0.996, and results were \n\nexpressed in mM TE per gram of dry weight. \n\n \n\n3.2.7. Statistical Analysis \n\n \n\nDesign Expert ver. 6.0.0 software (Stat-Ease 2000) was used to plan a complete factorial 2 x 3 \n\nx 2 experimental design, with three replicates. Plant part (factor A) was tested at two levels \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n92 \n\n \n\n(stems or leaves), and solvent (factor C) varied as acidified or non-acidified 80 % aqueous \n\nmethanol. Time (factor B) was tested at three levels: 24, 48 or 72 h. The magnitude and \n\nsignificance of main (A, B and C), two interactions (AB, AC and BC) and the three interaction \n\n(ABC) effects were accessed by regression analysis of variance (ANOVA). Magnitude of \n\neffects was accessed by the percentage of contribution of each model term relative to the sum \n\nof squares, and significant terms were confirmed by respective values. Refined models were \n\nobtained after removal non-significant terms, exclusion of influential results and power \n\ntransformation to comply with ANOVA assumptions. R2 and adjusted R2 were also used to \n\nverify model adequacy. A principal components analysis (PCA) was performed using SPSS \n\nsoftware, version 17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL), after Kaiser\u2013Meyer\u2013Olkin (KMO) and \n\nBartlett\u2019s tests, in order to analyze correlation between dependent variables and confirm \n\npatterns in data. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Results and discussion \n\n \n\nExtraction of plant polyphenols is a key step for polyphenol and antioxidant activity \n\ndeterminations; and important factors, like plant part (factor A), time (factor B) and solvent \n\n(factor C), need to be assessed in order to evaluate its impact on antioxidant activity. Plant part \n\nwas elected as a factor as different color of stems (green-purple) and leaves (leaves) were \n\nindicative of the presence of different compounds and possibly different antioxidant activities. \n\nTime and solvent may have conflicting actions on the solubilization and degradation of \n\npolyphenols (Robards 2003) and were included in the design to study factor interaction. Time \n\nassociated with boiling or stirring extraction methods for SP. leaves varied from 5 min (Huang \n\net al. 2010) to 24 h (Carvalho et al. 2010) (Table 3.1). To study the effect of longer times, \n\nextraction was allowed for 24, 48 and 72 h. Extraction with acidic solvents may release \n\ncompounds initially part of polymers or bounded to others. It may also contribute to the \n\nsolubilization and diffusion of phenolic compounds due to cell wall disintegration. In addition, \n\nthe use of water in combination with organic solvents ensures the extraction of polyphenols \n\ndue to the creation of a moderately polar medium. Enhanced recovering of polyphenols from \n\nplant material, including flavonols with low polymerization degree, had been reported (Robards \n\n2003). From the different acidification/solvent combinations reported for SP vines, it was \n\nchosen to test acidified or non-acidified 80 % methanol. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n93 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.1. Full and Reduced Factorial Models \n\n \n\nAccording to Table 3.2, main effect plant part (A) was dominant for TPC, TFC, RP and FRAP \n\nresults, with a percentage of contribution of total variability higher than 75 %, and highly \n\nsignificant (P &lt;0.001). For DPPH, solvent (factor C) as main effect explained 71 % of result \n\nvariability. Full-model ANOVA analysis exposed interaction between plant part and solvent \n\n(AC) to be significant for all assays although more important for TAA. Interaction plant part\u2013\n\ntime (AB) was only significant for RP. For TFC, interactions time\u2013 solvent (AC) to be \n\nsignificant for all assays although more important for TAA. Interaction plant part\u2013time (AB) \n\nwas only significant for RP. For TFC, interactions time\u2013solvent (BC) and plant part\u2013time\u2013\n\nsolvent (ABC) were still significant (P &lt;0.05), but with small contribution in explaining \n\nvariability. In order to comply with ANOVA assumptions, TFC, TAA and DPPH results were \n\nmodified by square root or inverse square root power transformation. TFC refined model \n\nconfirmed only plant part and solvent as significant effects. Adequacy of final models was also \n\nconfirmed by high R2 values with similar adjusted R2 results. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Effect of Plant Part, Time and Solvent on TPC and TFC \n\n \n\nFor TPC and TFC, plant part presented a highly significant positive effect on TPC and TFC \n\nestimated means (Figure 3.1). Solvent had effect on both assays, but in lesser magnitude than \n\nplant part. Non-acidified solvent increased TPC for stems, but for leaves, it had an opposite \n\neffect. Solvent effect on TFC results was lower than those observed for TPC. Therefore, \n\nacidification of 80 % methanol enhanced extraction of polyphenolic compounds from leaves, \n\nbut not flavonoid content. Opposite behavior was observed for stems. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n94 \n\n \n\nTable 3.1.

Effect of Plant Part, Time and Solvent on TAA and RP \n\n \n\nSolvent and time have different effects on the magnitude and significance of TAA and RP \n\nantioxidant measurements. As TAA was transformed by inverse square root function, graphical \n\ninterpretation should be done accordingly. Therefore, solvent affected more leaves than stems \n\nresults, and higher antioxidant activity was observed for acidified solvent in comparison with \n\nnon-acidified solvent (Figure 3.2). \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n96 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1.

Thus, other compounds than those quantified by the Folin\u2013Ciocalteau method \n\ncontribute to the reducing power of stems. Time influenced only leaves results and had a \n\npositive effect. As time did not affect influenced only leaves results and had a positive effect. \n\nAs time did not affect neither TPC nor TFC, this enhanced reduced power was possibly not \n\nassociated with polyphenols or flavonoids influenced only leaves results and had a positive \n\neffect. As time did not affect neither TPC nor TFC, this enhanced reduced power was possibly \n\nnot associated with polyphenols or flavonoids. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n97 \n\n \n\n3.3.4. Effect of Plant Part, Time and Solvent on FRAP and DPPH \n\n \n\nFRAP plant part\u2013solvent (AC) interaction (Figure 3.3) presented a behavior similar to TPC but \n\nnot to RP, as would be expected because RP and FRAP assays are based on similar reaction \n\nmechanisms (Berker et al. 2009). Solvent had more effect than plant part on DPPH, for both \n\nstems and leaves. Lower results obtained for acidified solvent may be related to slower reaction \n\ntime leading to less radical scavenging activity. The same differences were observed for \n\nacidified and non-acidified 50 % methanol (P\u00e9rez-Jim\u00e9nez and Saura-Calixto 2006). \n\n \n\n3.3.5. Variables Correlations and Pattern in Data \n\n \n\nFor SP leaves, high correlations between TPC/TAA, TPC/RP (Gupta and Prakash 2008) and \n\nTPC/DPPH (Truong et al. 2007) were reported. To evaluate how these correlations were \n\naffected in this study, PCA was performed. PCA was appropriate as all two-pair variables. \n\nPearson correlation coefficients were significant at a 0.05 level, KMO statistic was higher than \n\n0.5 and Bartlett\u2019s test of sphericity was significant. Two components that explained 97 % of \n\ndata variability were extracted. According to the loading plot (Figure 3.4A), all variables were \n\nstrong positively correlated to the first component (PC1). TFC, TPC, RP and FRAP were more \n\ncorrelated as they were more close to the PC1 axis than TAA or DPPH. DPPH was positively \n\nhighly correlated with PC2 and TAA negatively correlated at the same component. Data pattern \n\nfrom score plot (Figure 3.4B) confirmed plant part as the major influential factor, as PC1 \n\nseparated stems and leaves results. PC2, which split data in acidified and non-acidified solvent, \n\nrelates more to DPPH. \n\n \n\n3.3.6. Antioxidant Activity of SP Leaves and Stems \n\n \n\nCaution should be taken when comparing antioxidant activity data, as difference in method, \n\nsolvent and analytical conditions may lead to very diverse results. For comparison purposes, \n\nresults obtained with 24 h time and non-acidified solvent will be used (Table 3.3, in bold). TPC \n\nfor European SP leaves and stems were 1.22 and 0.60 g GAE/100 g dw, respectively.  \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n98 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2.

Loading plot for variables (A) and score plot for treatments (B) obtained from \nprincipal components analysis. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n100 \n\n \n\nThese values are lower than those published, which ranged from 0.85 and 5.35 g GAE/100 g \n\ndw from Fiji (Lako et al. 2007) and the U.S.A. (Huang et al. 2009), respectively. Besides the \n\ninfluence of genotype and edaphic\u2013climatic conditions, this study included a fresh storage \n\n(Table 3.1) prior to analysis that may have contributed to these lower results. TFC for SP leaves \n\n(0.59 g QE/100 g dw and 0.064 g QE/100 dw) (Table 3.3) were also lower than those reported \n\nfor leaves from China, 1.85 mg/100 g. (Chu et al. 2000). Still, European SP leaves had higher \n\nTPC than broccoli or spring onion (Isabelle et al. 2010), while SP stems were superior to lettuce \n\nor cucumber (Lako et al. 2007). As SP leaves and stems had FRAP results lower than DPPH \n\n(Table 3.3), samples had radical scavenging activity superior to metal-ion-reducing power. SP \n\nleaves from this study had higher FRAP results than peas, similar to carrots, but lower than \n\nbroccoli (Ou et al. 2002). FRAP determined in this study for SP stems is higher than onions \n\nand peas. DPPH results were very different than those reported for SP leaves, with activities \n\nbetween 199 and 227 mM TE/g dw (Truong et al. 2007). However, even with a storage step \n\nprior to analysis, SP leaves and stems had higher DPPH activity than onions (Gorinstein et al. \n\n2009). These results confirm that leaves and stems from European SP could be considered as a \n\npotential supplementary resource of antioxidants in human diet and have additional value added \n\nfor PGI agricultural products. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4. Conclusion \n\n \n\nPlant part (stems or leaves) presented the largest main significant effect (P &lt;0.001) for all \n\nassays, while for DPPH activity was the most influential factor. Time of extraction had the only \n\nsignificant effect on RP assay, as main effect and interaction with plant part. Although factors \n\nselected present different effects on assays, variables were highly correlated in a principal \n\ncomponent that explained 78 % of data variability. European SP vines, especially leaves, can \n\nbe considered as a natural source of antioxidants, with potential to be used as a food in the diet \n\nor as ingredient for functional applications aiming for health benefits.

The effect of nine extraction variables was identified as relevant in previous \n\nphenolics extraction studies, because solvent solid ratio, time, pH, peeling cut depth, \n\nparticle size, temperature, solvent, sample amount and agitation were combined in a 12 \n\nrun Plackett\u2013Burman design to screen for key factors. The extraction of phenolic \n\ncompounds was only significantly (p &lt;0.05) affected by solvent: solid ratio (positively) \n\nand peel cut depth (negatively) with similar effect magnitude. These factors effects \n\npresented similar direction, size and significance on extracts antioxidant activity \n\nmeasured by FRAP. Regression models on FRAP transformed by squared root function \n\nrevealed the two factor interaction peel cut depth and sample amount as the third most \n\ninfluencing factor. Beyond the usage of sweet potato peels as a new constituent for human \n\nfood, it should also be tested for ingredient optimized in the production of functional \n\nfoods. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Sweet potato; Ipomoea batatas; Peels; Phenolic compounds; Plackett\u2013\n\nBurman design. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n108 \n\n \n\n4.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nSweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) ranked as 3rd in the root and tubers crops world \n\nproduction in 2010 (FAO, 2010). It was identified as an excellent novel source of natural \n\nhealth promoting for the functional food market (Bovell-Benjamin, 2007). Sweet potato \n\nroots and leaves contain biologically active compounds with significant medicinal value \n\nas antioxidant properties that might beneficiate human health (Huang et al., 2006). This \n\ncrop was already claimed in patented functional compositions related to suppression of \n\nintestinal cancer (Iwasaki, 2003) and anti-aging food (McDaniel, 2011). Although usually \n\ntreated as waste, sweet potato peels (SPP) had also received attention for food and feed \n\napplication as they possessed high levels of phenolics (Zhu et al., 2010) and can reach \n\nalmost three times more antioxidant activity than the other plant tissues (Cevallos-Casals \n\nand Cisneros-Zevallos, 2002). It was recently demonstrated in animal models that SPP \n\npossessed a potent wound healing activity possibility associated to an underlying \n\nantioxidant mechanism (Panda et al., 2011). In addition, SPP extracts might be beneficial \n\nagainst Alzheimer\u2019s disease as it reduced the level of lipid peroxidation and increased \n\ncatalase activities in biochemical studies using the brain tissue of mice (Kim et al., 2011). \n\nThese findings reinforce the drive for recycling agro industry wastes as peels into valuable \n\nadding products (Peschel et al., 2006), namely at the post-harvest and peeling steps of the \n\nsupply chain. Losses during storage and transportation reached 6.3 % of 2007 sweet \n\npotato world production. Regarding peeling, industrial operations  reduced by 2 % and \n\n14 % the root fresh mass with steam and lye-peeling methods, respectively (Van Hal, \n\n2000). Values higher than 18 % waste reported for abrasion peeling of potatoes (Singh \n\nand Shukla, 1995) are expected for sweet varieties, as roots are usually more irregular. In \n\nfood service sector, preparation losses mainly due to peels from tubers and vegetables \n\nranged from 3 to 8 % of the food delivered (Engstrom and Carlsson-Kanyama, 2004). \n\nThe development process aiming peels valorisation needs inputs on the extraction of \n\ncompounds with potential health-promoting and/or disease-preventing properties. \n\nPlackett\u2013Burman designs (PBDs) have been used to study the influence of a large number \n\nof factors on phenolic compounds extraction with a small number of experimental trials \n\n(Dopico-Garcia et al., 2007; Luque-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2007; Priego-Capote et al., 2004). \n\nWhile focused in identifying main effects, PBD may provide information on two factors \n\ninteractions and increase research efficiency (Phoa et al., 2009). The objective of this \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n109 \n\n \n\nstudy was to screen by PBD the factors that alone or combined influence the extraction \n\nof phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity from SPP obtained as waste in food \n\nservice operations. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n4.2.1. Reagents \n\n \n\nFerric chloride (Merck); Folin Ciocalteau reagent (Merck); gallic acid (Fluka); glacial \n\nacetic acid (BDH-Prolabo); hydrochloric acid (Riedel); sodium acetate (Merk); Sodium \n\ncarbonate (Merk); trichloroacetic acid (BDH-Prolabo); 2,4,6-tripyridyl-2- triazine \n\n(TPTZ) (Sigma); Trolox (Sigma Aldrich). \n\n \n\n4.2.2. Plant material \n\n \n\nSweet potatoes were purchased at the market and transported to the lab on the same day. \n\nSPs were washed under tap water and air dried during the night. Roots were twice hand \n\npeeled in one direction with a cut depth circa 1.5 mm, corresponding to 8.4 \u00b1 2.1 and 7.8 \n\n\u00b1 2.0 % of fresh root for the first and second layer, respectively. Peels were dried at 60 \n\n?C during 48 h, milled and classified into two different sizes, all less than 200 \u00b5 m (70 \n\nmesh) and all less than 600 \u00b5 m (30 mesh). \n\n \n\n4.2.3. Extraction process \n\n \n\nTwelve treatments were made in triplicate employing the experimental plan as depicted \n\nin Table 4.1. Dried SPP varied in the layer depth of the hand cut (factor D) and particle \n\nsize (factor E).

Extracts were hold \n\nat ?18 ?C until analysis. \n\n \n\n4.2.4. Evaluation of extracts \n\n \n\nTotal phenolic content (TPC) was determined according to methods described by Huang \n\net al. (2006) with slight modifications. A calibration curve of gallic acid in the range 12.5\u2013\n\n100 \u00b5 g/mL (R2 = 0.995) was constructed, and the TPC was expressed as g gallic acid \n\nequivalent (GAE) in 100 g of dried material. Ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) \n\nwas according to the method described by Benzie and Strain (1999) was used, with some \n\nmodifications. An aliquot of 200 l was added to 3 mL of FRAP reagent (buffer acetate \n\n300 mM, pH 3.6; 40 mM of HCl; 10 mM of TPTZ and 20 mM ferric chloride). After the \n\nmixture stood at 20 ?C for 4 min in the dark, the absorbance at 593 nm was measured \n\nagainst a blank. A calibration curve for Trolox was made at the range of 50 and 175 \u00b5 M \n\nwith a regression coefficient of 0.9991 (data not shown) and results were expressed in \n\n\u00b5 M Trolox equivalent (TE) per gram of dry weight. All absorbance readings were made \n\nin a T70+ UV/Vis Spectrometer (PG Instruments Ltd., United Kingdom). \n\n \n\n4.2.5. Statistical analysis \n\n \n\nA 12 run non-geometric PBD with nine factors and two dummy variables were varied at \n\ntwo levels in a combined pattern of Hamada and Wu matrices (Table 1). Average of \n\nresponses TPC and FRAP were obtained from treatment replicates (three). Data analysis \n\nwas performed by first determining main effects size and significance followed by \n\nregression analysis for the assessment of two factor interactions. \n\n \n\n4.2.5.1. Main effects \n\n \n\nSignificant main effects were assessed by half-probability plots, Lenth\u2019s method and \n\nAnalysis of Variance (ANOVA). In halfprobability plots, the absolute values of the nine \n\nmain effect estimates were plotted against half-normal scores. Scale was defined by \n\npartitioning the right half of the normal distribution in nine parts of equal area. In the \n\npresence of a small number of active main effects, inactive factors scores should follow \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n \n\nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n\n112 \n\n \n\na straight line and the active ones should look like outliers (Heyden et al., 2001). Lenth\u2019s \n\nmethod determined a pseudo standard error that was plotted in a standardized Pareto chart \n\nobtained by dividing the absolute value of the estimated effects by the standard error \n\n(Zhao et al., 2011). Evidence of a significant effect was given when respective bar extents \n\nLenth\u2019s distance. In addition, ANOVA at a 95 % significant level and Hierarquical \n\nCluster Analysis (HCA) using between groups linkage method with Euclidean distance \n\nwere performed to aid interpretation (Tyssedal and Niemi, 2011). \n\n \n\n4.2.5.2. Two factors interaction \n\n \n\nWhen the number of significant main effects was not too large, regression analysis was \n\nused to investigate two-factor interactions (2FI\u2019s) based on Phoa et al. (2009) research. \n\nFirst, all main factors identified by previous approaches and all possible two factors \n\ninteractions were submitted to a forward method selection during regression analysis and \n\nvariables with a confidence level higher than 95 % were considered as significant. \n\nSecond, all main effects are added to the model again and a new variable selection was \n\nperformed. New two factors interactions on the model were analysed again for \n\nsignificance. Process was repeated until goodness of fit indices, as squared coefficient of \n\ndetermination (R2), adjusted squared coefficient of determination (R2Ajd) and regression \n\nstandard deviation measured by mean squared error (MSE) stopped changing. When it \n\nwas necessary to distinguish between competing models, residual analysis was done. \n\nBackward and stepwise methods were also used for comparison purposes. Design Expert \n\n6.0.11 (Stat-Ease Corporation, Minneapolis, USA) was used for all statistical analyses \n\nexcept cluster analysis performed by PASW Statistic 18.0 software (SPSS, Chicago, \n\nUSA). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n \n\nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n\n113 \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.

Results and discussion \n\n \n\n4.3.1. Factors selection \n\n \n\nThe selection of factors to be included in the screening design was based on variables tested in \n\ncomparative, screening and optimization studies on polyphenols extraction with different plant \n\nmaterials and methods (Table 4.2). Temperature, time, solvent and solvent: solid ratio were \n\nincluded in most of the studies. For temperature, all situations were observed: positive effect \n\n(Molan et al., 2009; Luque-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2007; Santos and Meireles, 2011; Han et al., 2011), \n\nnegative (\u00c7am and Hisil, 2010; Dopico-Garcia et al., 2007; Ghafoor et al., 2010), positive and \n\nnegative depending on solvent used (Guerrero et al., 2008) and no effect (Priego-Capote et al., \n\n2004). Time presented always a significant positive effect on TPC with one exception (C\u00b8 am \n\nand Hisil, 2010). The effect of solvent: solid ratio also varied, positive (Borges et al., 2011; Han \n\net al., 2011) or negative (Molan et al., 2009). When studied, the increase of pH affected TPC \n\nnegatively. Factors as peeling cut depth (Padda and Picha, 2008), particle size (\u00c7am and Hisil, \n\n2010), amount of sample (Luque-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2007) and agitation (Molan et al., 2009) were \n\nstudied in much lesser extent, both alone or combined with other factors. Therefore, all nine \n\nfactors presented in Table 2 were included in a PBD to screen respective effect on aqueous \n\nextraction of TPC from dried SPP. FRAP assay was also included to compare extraction \n\nefficiency with antioxidant activity. \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Factors levels \n\n \n\nFactors levels were defined in line with food service operational constraints and conventional \n\nsolid liquid extractions (Table 1). Solvent solid ratio varied from 10 to 50, with the objective to \n\nassess influence at the approximate middle range for studies with opposite conclusions (Molan \n\net al., 2009; Borges et al., 2011). Time of contact had 2-h span and ranged from 60 to 180 min \n\nto assess longer time effects than those used in previous studies (\u00c7am and Hisil, 2010; Molan \n\net al., 2009; Luque-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2007; Chirinos et al., 2007; Borges et al., 2011; Han et al., \n\n2011). To gather information on the effect of pH higher than 5, neutral pH was tested in addition \n\nto the acidic conditions reported as favourable to phenolics extraction (Luque-Rodr\u00edguez et al., \n\n2007; Chirinos et al., 2007). Root cut depth was related to layer thickness obtained by hand \n\npeeling, included in the study as previous studies reported that Phenolic compounds in sweet \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n115 \n\n \n\npotato were mainly present at the outer 5 mm of tissue of the root (Van Hal, 2000). The effect \n\nof using different cuts in food service operations was accessed by analysis peels obtained from \n\n1.5 or 3.0 mm cut depths, phenolic compounds were mainly present at the outer 5 mm of tissue \n\nof the sweet potato root (Van Hal, 2000). Particle size was varied considering the availability \n\nof one only sieve mesh, 0.2 or 0.6 mm. Temperature levels tested (27 or 40 ?C) were both in \n\nthe mild range in the attempt to reduce both phenolics degradation and energy costs. For the \n\nsolvent factor, tap water available in food service operations was tested in opposition to distilled \n\none normally used in extraction studies. With the purpose to rationalize further optimization \n\nstudies, the effect of scale on the bioactives extraction was ascertained by sample weight at 0.1 \n\nor 1 g. Finally, agitation was varied between reduced and high rotations for quantification of \n\nfactor effect. \n\n \n\n4.3.3. Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity \n\n \n\nTPC of SPP varied between 1.02 \u00b1 0.20 and 6.21 \u00b1 0.30 mg GAE/g dw (Table 1) which was \n\nencouraging for conventional solid liquid extraction. This range was higher than results \n\nreported for mashua tubers (0.2 mg GAE/g dw) by conventional extraction (Chirinos et al., \n\n2007) and for fruit skins (3.5 mg GAE/g dw) by more friendly phenolic extraction methods \n\n(Santos and Meireles, 2011). However, SPP presented lower TPC than other vegetables wastes, \n\nas cucumber (?18 mg GAE/g dw) or artichoke (?11 mg GAE/g dw) (Peschel et al., 2006). A \n\nwider variation for FRAP results was observed in comparison to TPC with a range of 0.71\u20138.11 \n\n\u00b5 M TE/g dw. Pearson correlation between TPC and FRAP was 0.77 (p &lt;0.01) that was in line \n\nwith correlations reported by Molan et al. (2009). \n\n \n\n4.3.3.1. Main effects \n\n \n\nHalf-normal probability plot for TPC (Figure 4.1A) revealed solvent: solid ratio (factor A) and \n\ncut depth (factor D) as possible active effects as they deviate from a straight line through formed \n\nby the remaining non-significant factors normally distributed around zero. Lenth\u2019s method \n\nconfirmed these two factors as active (Figure 4.1B) with a threshold significance of 0.01, \n\nindicated by ANOVA results (Table 3).  \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n116 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1.

However, model presented \n\nlower R2Ajd and higher MSE than forward and stepwise procedures. Therefore, the calculus \n\napproach used in this study did not identify factors interactions beside two main effects for \n\n\n\nChapter 4 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n118 \n\n \n\nTPC. Regarding magnitude, phenolic compounds extraction was enhanced by higher solvent \n\nsolid ratios for emerging technologies (Borges et al., 2011; Han et al., 2011) but not by \n\nconventional method (Molan et al., 2009). Cut depth negative effect was also observed \n\npreviously by Padda and Picha (2008). As standardized residuals departed from normality (data \n\nnot shown), FRAP data transformation by log function was required.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.3.

Interactions DH and AD were third and fourth in absolute effect \n\nsize, both with negative direction. Cut depth was the most negative influential factor both as \n\nmain effect and in interaction. Solvent pH combined with solvent solid ration had negative \n\neffect. In resume, the factors that influenced more both TPC and FRAP were solvent solid ratio \n\nand root cut depth. Future optimization studies should vary solvent solid ratio at the highest \n\ntested level (50) and cut depth at the lower. The benefits on including the second layer of peeled \n\nsweet potato need assessment regarding its detrimental effect on phenolics concentration and \n\nantioxidant activity. Whilst no influential factor interactions were identified for TPC, higher \n\nantioxidant activities were obtained at both lower pH and sample amount. These factors setting \n\nwill contribute to the enhance efficacy of future optimization studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4. Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe extraction of phenolic compounds from sweet potato peels was only significantly (p &lt;0.05) \n\naffected by solvent: solid ratio (positively) and peel cut depth (negatively) with similar effect \n\nsize. These variables had a similar effect on the size and importance of antioxidant activity as \n\nmeasured by FRAP. Regression models revealed significant main effects and two factors \n\ninteractions for FRAP but not for TPC. After transformation of FRAP by the squared root \n\nfunction, sample size was selected by stepwise procedure as main effect and in interaction with \n\nsolvent: solid ratio. In addition, a small positive influence of pH in interaction with solvent: \n\nsolid ratio on antioxidant activity was observed. These results encourage the utilization of SPP \n\nobtained from food services operations as valuable sources for biological active compounds \n\nwith antioxidant activity. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5.

Introduction \n\n \n\nSweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is a most used agro product in the world, especially in Asia \n\nand Africa where it is used in traditional diets. This root has also been profusely included in the \n\ncomposition of innovative applications such as ice-cream (Gurgel et al. 2011) or non-\n\ncarbonated drink (Wireko-Manu et al. 2010). Further examples of developed functional sweet \n\npotato products are chips, flakes, yogurts and juices (Barnes and Sanders, 2012). Agro by-\n\nproducts represent an important source of phytochemicals such as phenolic compounds, \n\npossessing a wide range of functional activities. Peels are accounted as one of the major wastes \n\ngenerated during the processing of sweet potato with currently little commercial value \n\n(Maloney et al. 2012) and few research has been performed to upgrade it. Sweet potato peels \n\n(SPP) contain a high phenolic content with free radical scavenging activities (Zhu et al. 2010) \n\nwhich were related to health benefits such as wound healing (Panda et al. 2011). Studies on \n\nSPP valorisation have already covered applications such as production of bioethanol (Oyeleke \n\net al. 2012), pharmaceuticals (Manpreet et al. 2005) and biosurfactants (Saharan et al. 2011). \n\nRecycling of agro wastes into high valuable products with potential health benefits could be \n\nachieved through extraction. As processing conditions are recognised to influence the removal \n\nof phenolics which are located particularly in the peel (Peschel et al. 2006), process modelling \n\nand optimization may encourage food operators to upgrade agro-waste. The optimization of the \n\nextraction of bioactive compounds from SPP was previously investigated by Response Surface \n\nMethodology (RSM) by Maloney and coworkers (2012). RSM is a reputed statistical technique \n\nproposed to improve processes by the means of its modelling capabilities to locate optimized \n\npoints for various processes (Ilzarbe et al. 2008). Artificial neural network (ANN) has been \n\napplied in parallel with RSM method in prediction and modelling of extraction of phenolics \n\nwith improvement in data fitting (Cheok et al. 2012; Wen et al. 2012). Phenolics extraction \n\noptimization studies were performed on fruit and vegetable peels such as apple (Junjian et al. \n\n2013), grape (Casazza et al. 2012; Ghafoor et al. 2010), jabuticaba (Santos and Meireles 2011), \n\npomegranate (Amyrgialaki et al. 2014; Tabaraki et al. 2012), orange (Dahmoune et al. 2014), \n\ntangerine (Londo\u00f1o-Londo\u00f1o et al. 2010), bambangan (Prasad et al. 2011), banana (Gonz\u00e1lez-\n\nMontelongo et al. 2010), mangosteen (Cheok et al. 2012), rambutan (Prakash Maran et al. \n\n2013), tea fruit (Xu et al. 2012) as well as and potato (Amado et al. 2014; Singh et al. 2011; \n\nWijngaard et al. 2012). For the six aforementioned peel materials, the experimental design was \n\nbased on a Central Composite Design (CCD). The objective of this work was to model the \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n127 \n\n \n\neffect of solvent: solid ratio, time and temperature on the extraction of phenolic compounds \n\nwith radical scavenging activity from SPP through a CCD by RSM and ANN, and define the \n\nbest conditions to obtain infusions with high phenolic content and biological activity. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2. Materials and methods \n\n \n\n5.2.1. Reagents \n\n \n\n2,2-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Folin\u2013Ciocalteau reagent, 2-2\u2019-azino-bis (3 \n\nethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), gallic acid, sodium persulfate \n\nand Trolox were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. (Poole, U.K.). Sodium carbonate was \n\npurchased from VWR (West Chester, PA). Absolute ethanol was bought from Merck \n\n(Nottingham, U.K.). All reagents were of analytical grade. \n\n \n\n5.2.2. Plant material  \n\n \n\nSweet potatoes were purchased at local markets and transported to the lab at the same day. \n\nRoots were washed under tap water and air-dried during the night. Peeling was done manually \n\nwith a cut depth of circa 1.5 mm, and peels were then dried at 60 \u00baC for 48 h. The dried material \n\nwas then milled and sieved until all particles were smaller than 600 \u00b5m (30 mesh). \n\n \n\n5.2.3. Extraction process  \n\n \n\nTwenty extractions runs were performed with respect to the CCD experimental plan presented \n\nin Table 5.1. 25 mL of distilled water at the proper temperature were transferred into a 250 mL \n\nscrew cap flask with an adequate quantity of SPP powder regarding the experiment. The \n\nmixtures were stirred at constant rate of 200 rpm on a hot plate stirrer (HS0707V2, Favorit, \n\nMalaysia) at the respective run temperatures measured by digital food thermocouple (Model HI \n\n98501, Hanna Instruments, Bedfordshire, UK). Extracts were filtered through a filter paper with \n\na vacuum pump aspirator (DOA-P604-BN, Cast Manufacturing Inc., USA) and volume filled \n\nup to 25 mL. Extracts were hold at -18 \u00baC by the day of analysis. \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n128 \n\n \n\nTable 5.1.

Evaluation of extracts  \n\n \n\nTotal phenolic content (TPC), ABTS radical scavenging activity and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-\n\npicrylhydrazyl ) radical scavenging activity were determined regarding the method described \n\npreviously by Prieto et al. (1999), Re et al. (1999) and Blois (1958), respectively, with minor \n\nmodifications (Nunes et al. 2012). In addition, DPPH assay values were determined using \n\nabsolute ethanol as a solvent. TPC was expressed in mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE) per gram \n\nof dried material (DM) while ABTS and DPPH values were reported as mg of Trolox equivalent \n\n(TE)/g DM. Determinations were carried out in triplicate and data were reported as means \u00b1 \n\nSD. All absorbance readings were made by a T70+ UV/Vis Spectrometer (PG Instruments Ltd, \n\nUnited Kingdom). \n\n \n\n5.2.5. Statistical Analysis  \n\n \n\nA Central Composite Design (CCD) for the aqueous solid\u2013liquid extraction of SPP was used \n\nwith three independent variables, solvent: solid ratio (X1), time (X2) and temperature (X3) on \n\nthree responses, TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays (Table 5.1). The experimental plan contained \n\n20 runs, with 8 factorial points, 6 axial points and 6 central points. In order to have equal \n\nprecision of estimation in all directions, design was made rotatable by an axial distance of 1.68, \n\nwhich corresponded to the 4-th root of the number of factorial points. Therefore, variables were \n\ncoded at five levels (-1.68,-1, 0, 1, 1.68). Pearson correlations were conducted to examine the \n\nrelationship between the antioxidant assays. A three-dimensional scatter-plot was built to \n\ncompare the conditions of phenolic compounds extraction among studies performed on fruit \n\nand vegetable peels. The software used for the establishment of the experimental design, \n\nanalysis of the data and creation of the plots was JMP\u00ae Pro 10.0.2 (www.jmp.com) provided \n\nat no cost by SAS (www.sas.com). Figures 5.2 and 5.5 were constructed by Microsoft\u00ae Excel \n\n2013. For RSM analysis, data were approximated to a second-order polynomial equation by the \n\nleast-square regression method with the selection of the significant coefficients by the backward \n\nmethod (?out=0.05) with no rules (model hierarchy was not mandatory). The coefficient of \n\ndetermination (R2), adjusted R2 (R2adj) and root mean square error (RMSE) were used to access \n\nthe models performance. Fitted models were used to build surface plots and extraction \n\nconditions optimization was performed by maximizing the desirability function. For the \n\nanalysis by ANN, a simple single layer structure with three inputs, X1, X2 and X3, one hidden \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n130 \n\n \n\nlayer with seven nodes and TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays as outputs was exploited to model \n\nthe experimental data obtained from CCD design (Figure 5.1). The data were divided into two \n\nsubsets, training and validation and network topology was trained by k-fold cross validation \n\nmethod (k=6). One hidden layer was considered previously adequate by trial and error for \n\nadjusting extraction data (Cheok et al. 2012). The hyperbolic-tangent activation function was \n\nused as transfer function in the hidden layer to the output layer. The number of neurons in the \n\nhidden layer was adjusted iteratively to maximize performance fitting determined by R2 and \n\nRMSE.

Optimization was performed by maximizing the \n\ndesirability function. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1. Diagram of the Artificial Neural Network architecture.

Results and discussion \n\n \n\n5.3.1. Design and variables selection \n\n \n\nData from optimization studies on the extraction of phenolics (measured by the Folin-\n\nCiocalteau assay) and free radical scavenging activity from fruit and vegetable peels were \n\nrecorded and presented in Table 2. Studies on peels valorisation through the extraction of \n\nphenolic compounds had been much more focused on fruits than on vegetables. However, only \n\ntwo studies included the measurement of ABTS free radical inhibition and/or DPPH free radical \n\nscavenging activities expressed in TE (Wijngaard et al. 2012). Research on optimization were \n\nperformed by conventional solid-liquid extraction as well as innovative processes have been \n\ninvestigate such as high pressure carbon dioxide extraction (Santos and Meireles 2011), \n\nsupercritical fluid extraction (Casazza et al. 2012) and pressurized liquid extraction (Wijngaard \n\net al. 2012). According to Table 5.2, most of the experimental plans were based on CCD with \n\nthree independent factors. Solvent: solid ratio was included as an independent variable in four \n\noptimization studies and it was considered a fixed factor in the majority of them. On the other \n\nhand, time and temperature were considered as independent factors in many investigations done \n\non peels, although not always combined. Regarding the extraction of phenolic compounds from \n\nSPP, solvent: solid ratio and depth cut were identified as critical factors in a previous screening \n\nstudy (Anast\u00e1cio and Carvalho 2013). The most favourable level identified for depth cut, 1.5 \n\nmm, was used as a fixed condition in this work. Time and temperature when varied between \n\n60-180 min and 27-40 \u00baC did not influenced the extraction of phenolics from SPP (Anast\u00e1cio \n\nand Carvalho, 2013). They were included in this optimization study as independent variables \n\nwith a wider range of variation. Thus, the design selection for the aqueous extraction process \n\nwas a three-factor CCD with solvent: solid ratio (X1), time (X2) and temperature (X3) as \n\nindependent variables and TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays as responses. This design and \n\nindependent will provide useful information on the body of knowledge regarding extraction of \n\nphenolic compounds with antiradical activity from fruit and vegetable peels. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n132 \n\n \n\nTable 5.2.

Independent variables levels \n\n \n\nAccording to Table 5.2, the widest range for solvent: solid ratio (X1) was tested for a \n\nconventional extraction of phenols from mangosteen peels with a minimum value of 5.4 and \n\nmaximum value of 200 mL/g (Cheok et al. 2012). The time of extraction (X2) was studied at \n\nvery different levels whereas the conventional extraction for grape peels had the largest range, \n\nfrom 540 to 1740 min (Casazza et al. 2012). The lowest level studied was five minutes for \n\nphenolics extraction from potato peels (Singh et al. 2011). Regarding temperature (X3) of \n\nconventional extractions, the lowest and highest temperatures studied were 25 \u00baC (Gonz\u00e1lez-\n\nMontelongo et al. 2010) and 90 \u00baC (Amado et al. 2014), respectively. Thus, minimum and \n\nmaximum levels for the independent variables in the design were 30 to 60 mL/g for solvent: \n\nsolid ratio, 30 to 90 min for time and 25 to 75 \u00baC for temperature. These settings were adjusted \n\nnear to the median of values reported for fruit and vegetable peels studies (Table 5.2). \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Total phenolic content and free radical scavenging activity \n\n \n\nTPC results of SPP varied between 5.64 and 11.86 mg GAE/g DM (Table 5.1). This range was \n\nwider than reported value in the previous factor screening design (Anast\u00e1cio and Carvalho \n\n2013) whereas an improvement of phenolic extraction was achieved. ABTS results of SPP \n\npresented a similar range of variation to TPC (3.91-12.85 mg TE/g DM), so these two variables \n\nare strongly associated with a Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (R) of 0.957 (p<0.001). DPPH \n\nassay results had values between 13.76 and 49.79 mg TE/g DM, and were higher than ABTS \n\nresults. ABTS free radicals could be dissolved in aqueous media whereas DPPH free radicals \n\ncan only be dissolved in organic media (Wojdylo at al. 2007). The differences observed for the \n\ntwo assays might be justified by higher antiradical activities of SPP lipophilic compounds in \n\ncomparison to hydrophilic compounds. Still, DPPH and ABTS assays results values were \n\nmoderately correlated (R= 0.521; p<0.05). A lower correlation of TPC with DPPH method \n\n(R=0.666; p<0.01) than with ABTS was observed. The higher ability of SPP\u2019s extracts to \n\nscavenge DPPH free radicals in comparison to inhibit ABTS free radicals may be related to \n\ncompounds that are not determined by the Folin-Ciocalteau assay. Regarding other studies, \n\nTPC results were in line with those observed by Zhu et al. (2010) for the SPP methanolic \n\ninfusions ranged from 8 to 20 mg GAE/g DM. However, TPC values was lower than other \n\nvegetable wastes such as broccoli (~30 mg GAE/g DM) or chicory (~13 mg GAE/g DM) \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n135 \n\n \n\n(Peschel et al. 2006). Regarding relationships between variables, a moderate correlation \n\ncoefficient between TPC and ABTS was obtained for banana peels (R > 0.55) (Gonz\u00e1lez-\n\nMontelongo et al. 2010) while DPPH and ABTS assays results were more related (R > 0.70) \n\nthan what was observed in this work. \n\n \n\n5.3.4. Extraction modelling by RSM \n\n \n\nRSM analysis fitted experimental values were onto second order polynomial equations. \n\nAccording to ANOVA results for (Table 5.3), TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays fitted models were \n\nsignificant at a confidence level of 0.001, and p-values of the lack of fit were all higher than \n\n0.05 confirmed suitability of the selected design. Prediction equations were presented in \n\nSupplementary data. The coded regression coefficients sign and magnitude gives a direct \n\nmeasure of the contribution of the various independent variables in each response (Figure 5.2). \n\nFor TPC response, temperature of extraction (X3) presented the highest positive effect followed \n\nby the interaction term between solvent: solid and temperature (X1X3).  \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5.3.

Time (X2) was the least influential variable for SPP extracts and as the main \n\neffect it was only significant for ABTS. The fitted models explained 96 % of the variability \n\nobserved for TPC and 99 % for ABTS whereas it was slightly lower (94 %) for DPPH assay, \n\nas indicated by the coefficients of determination (R2) (Figure 5.2). Adjusted coefficients of \n\ndetermination (R2Adj) were similar in value with R2 for all three models. Root mean squared \n\nerror (RMSE) was much higher for DPPH method than the others responses which \n\ndemonstrates the existence of a higher variance of the fitted model. To exemplify the combined \n\neffects of variables, surface plots of solvent: solid and temperature were constructed for TPC, \n\nABTs and DPPH assays responses (Figure 5.3). Positive interactions between solvent: solid and \n\ntemperature could be confirmed. By analysing the slopes for each variable, it is anticipated that \n\nthe upper level of solvent: solid and temperature will be optimal for the extraction of phenols. \n\n \n\n5.3.5. Extraction modelling by ANN \n\n \n\nThe ANN equation models were presented in Supplementary data. R2 values for ANN models \n\nwere 0.931 for TPC and 0.936 for both ABTS and DPPH assays. Regarding RMSE, TPC, ABTS \n\nand DPPH models presented values of 0.501, 0.458 and 1.77, respectively. Only DPPH assay \n\nmodel presented a higher R2 and lower RMSE than RSM models. As ANN is not able to provide \n\ninsights of the models as directly as RSM approach, the rate of change of a response with change \n\nin the given input variable was computed with the remaining fixes at their mean value (Figure \n\n5.4). The greater the influence of the variable the higher the slope and range of change in the \n\nresponse. It could be observed that temperature (X3) presented the highest influence on TPC \n\nfollowed by solvent: solid ratio (X1) with a positive effect. Due to its low slope, time (X2) had \n\nminimum impact on TPC response. For ABTS results, temperature (X3) also presented the \n\nhigher effect and positive slope. The influence of solvent solid (X1) was similar to time (X2) \n\nbut opposite direction, solvent: solid ratio had a positive effect while time presented a negative \n\ninfluence. For DPPH assay values, solid: solvent was the main influential factor. Time and \n\ntemperature presented both a positive slope that was lower than solvent: solid slope.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n138 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 5.3.

Time influence was always smaller than the other factors. \n\nTemperature presented a strong positive effect on both TPC and ABTS responses but less \n\npronounced in DPPH assay results. \n\n \n\n5.3.6. Extraction optimization \n\n \n\nThe operational extraction conditions that maximized simultaneously TPC, ABTS and DPPH \n\nassays by RSM were a solvent: solid ratio of 60 mL/g, a time of 30 minutes and a temperature \n\nof 75 \u00baC. These optimized settings had a desirability of 0.94. For solvent: solid ratio and \n\ntemperature, the optimal point was located at the maximum of the variables range. This was \n\nconsequence of a pronounced effect of these two variables individually and in interaction. An \n\noptimized temperature value at the upper limit of the experimental design was also obtained \n\nfor juticaba (Santos and Meireles 2011), pomegranate (Tabaraki et al. 2012), rambutan \n\n(Prakash Maran et al. 2013) and potato peels (Wijngaard et al. 2012). At optimal extraction \n\nconditions, the predicted TPC, ABTS and DPPH assays values were 11.87 \u00b1 0.69 mg GAE/g \n\nDM, 12.91 \u00b1 0.42 mg TE/g DM and 46.35 \u00b1 2.71 mg TE/g DM, respectively. When each \n\nresponse was maximized individually, the same optimal point was obtained for ABTS and \n\nDPPH methods. However, the optimal setting for time changed to 48.1 when TPC response \n\nwas optimized individually. Predicted responses when maximizing TPC were 11.98 \u00b1 0.61 mg \n\nGAE/g DM for TPC, 12.29 \u00b1 0.33 mg TE/g DM for ABTS and 46.35 \u00b1 2.71 mg TE/g DM for \n\nDPPH assay. These results were not statistically different (p<0.05) from the optimization for \n\nall responses. The optimal extraction conditions obtained by ANN approach were identical to \n\nRSM. ANN predicted responses were 11.44 mg GAE/g DM for TPC, 12.84 mg TE/g DM for \n\nABTS and 47.1 mg TE/g DM for DPPH method. This optimal presented a desirability value of \n\n0.91. When optimized individually, solvent: solid and temperature factors solution did not \n\nchange from 60 mL /g and 75 \u00baC, respectively. However, the optimal extraction time was 42.3, \n\n22.7 and 86.1 minutes when the desirability function was maximized only for TPC, ABTS and \n\nDPHH, respectively. Predicted responses were in line with the overall optimum. \n\nConsidering that the conventional extraction conditions were different, than those used in in \n\nstudy, SPP water extracts presented a higher optimal TPC value than potato peels but much \n\nlower than fruits peels (Table 5.2). SPP optimal ABTS value was than banana peels but optimal \n\n\n\nChapter 5 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n141 \n\n \n\nDPPH assay was higher than potato and banana peels.

Thus, the aqueous extraction of phenols from SPP had a high valorisation potential within \n\nagro peels. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5.

RSM and ANN models presented the same optimal extraction conditions by \n\nmaximization of the desirability function. The optimal settings were a solvent: solid ratio of 60 \n\nmL/g, time of 30 min and temperature of 75 \u00baC with experimental values of 11.87 \u00b1 0.69 mg \n\nGAE/g DM, 12.91 \u00b1 0.42 mg TE/g DM and 46.35 \u00b1 2.71 mg TE/g DM for TPC, ABTS and \n\nDPPH assays, respectively. SPP optimized conditions for the aqueous extraction of phenolic \n\ncompounds with antiradical activity may represent an opportunity for food processors to \n\ntransform this by-product from a liability to an asset. Future research will focus on the \n\ndevelopment of food applications with potential health benefits based on SPP aqueous extracts. \n\n \n\n \n\nConflicts of interest \n\n \n\nThe Authors declares that there is no conflict of interest. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.5.

Formula components were sweet potato peel (Ipomoeas batatas) \n\naqueous extract (SPPE), sweet potato leaves water extract (SPLE) and honey solution (HonS). \n\nAccording to linear squares regression (LSR) models, SPLE presented higher positive effect \n\non total phenolic content (TPC), FRAP and DPPH assays than the other components. All \n\nantagonist interactions were not significant. The optimum formula obtained by artificial neural \n\nnetworks (ANN) analysis was 50.0 % of SPPE, 21.5 % of SPLE and 28.5 % of HonS. Predicted \n\nresponses of TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and soluble solids were 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, \n\n1098 mg TE/L and 12.3 \u00baBrix, respectively. Optimization with LSR models was similar to \n\nANN. Beverage prototype results positioned next to commercial vegetable and fruit beverages \n\nthus it has an interesting potential to the market of health and wellness. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Ipomoeas batatas; Sweet potato peels; sweet potato leaves; honey; beverage; \n\nphenolics; antioxidant activity; mixture design; artificial neural network; optimization. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n152 \n\n \n\n6.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nOxidative stress accelerates aging and contributes to several degenerative diseases due to the \n\npresence of excessive free radicals inside cells. These reactive oxygen species can cause cell \n\ninjury due to structural damage and activation of gene regulatory proteins leading to disease \n\n(Adly 2010). As antioxidants, phenolics may protect cell constituents against oxidative damage. \n\nThere is a growing interest in agro-wastes valorisation into functional products due to the \n\nincreasing sustainable development demand from society (Spatafora and Tringali 2012). Sweet \n\npotato (Ipomoea batatas) peels are one of the major wastes generated during root processing \n\n(Maloney et al. 2012). Owing to their high phenolic content and antioxidant activity, sweet \n\npotato peels were considered to be a valuable source for biological active compounds for \n\nfunctional foods (Anast\u00e1cio and Carvalho 2013a). Sweet potato had demonstrated a protective \n\neffect on oxidative-stress-related neurodegenerative diseases such as atherosclerosis (Miyazaki \n\net al. 2008) and Alzheimer (Ye et al. 2010). Since peels can reach almost three times more \n\nantioxidant activity than any other sweet potato plant tissues (Cevallos-Casals and Cisneros-\n\nZevallos 2001), they may also have health benefits related to oxidative stress prevention. To \n\nleverage the conversion of sweet potato peels from a liability to an asset, studies on its \n\napplication on innovative foods are needed. The use of by-products as a source of active \n\ningredients to produce functional beverages was already considered a promising approach \n\n(Corbo et al. 2014). Due to an increased demand for intake of dietary antioxidants, the \n\ndevelopment of an antioxidant rich beverage should be considered (Nanasombat et al. 2015). \n\nThe consumption of beverages rich in polyphenols limit the risk of various degenerative \n\ndiseases associated with oxidative stress due to their role in protecting cell constituents against \n\ndamage (Pandey and Rizvi 2009). Additionally, the growth of the health and wellness beverage \n\nmarket is set to outperform the wider soft and hot drinks industry until 2016 (Cowland 2013). \n\nSweet potato was the base of a non-alcoholic beverage with properties similar to fruit juices \n\n(Weirko-Manu et al. 2010), and claimed in a patented functional juice (Barnes and Sanders \n\n2012) and anti-aging food (McDaniel 2010). The addition of peel extracts of citrus (Kim et al. \n\n2012) and plums (de Beer et al. 2012) to beverages raised their antioxidant activity. Thus, an \n\nantioxidant beverage based on sweet potato peels is a promising path for its valorisation. Using \n\nalso sweet potato leaves as a formula component enhances the recycling concept of the new \n\nproduct. Leaves were identified as potential source of antioxidants (Anast\u00e1cio and Carvalho \n\n2013b) that could prevent or moderate oxidative stress related diseases (Islam 2006). There are \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n153 \n\n \n\nfew patented beverages with sweet potato peels or leaves. Sweet potato peels (Chuanbin and \n\nXianxun 2011) and leaves (Qiuyun 2012) were used for the production of beers. Regarding \n\nnon-alcoholic beverages, only leaves were patented for a juice beverage (Hong 2011). The \n\nbeverage prototype could have poor taste acceptability due to astringency related to phenolic \n\ncontent (de Beer et al. 2012). Honey was also added to the formulations as a sweetener and also \n\nas a functional component because its radical scavenging activity can ameliorate oxidative \n\nstress (Erejuwa et al. 2012). Honey was already used in combination with sweet potato tuber \n\nin patented functional foods, as curd (Luo 2014), cake (Tong et al. 2014), preserved strip (Lin \n\n2014, Laijin et al. 2009) and candied (Yong 2012). The assessment of synergistic and \n\nantagonistic interactions between components is relevant for functional foods (Wang et al. \n\n2011) and can be achieved through a mixture design methodology on the beverage formula.  \n\nThis approach was used in the optimization of a nutraceutical fruit juice (Lawless et al. 2012) \n\nand a cardio protection beverage (Gunathilake et al. 2013). Artificial neural network (ANN) \n\nhas been applied in parallel with multivariate techniques to increase modelling performance. \n\nFew applications of ANNs have been published for optimization of mixture designs related to \n\nfood. The aim of this study was to optimize the antioxidant activity of a beverage benchtop \n\nprototype made from sweet potato peel aqueous extract (SPPE), sweet potato leaves aqueous \n\nextract (SPLE) and honey solution (HonS) as components, through a mixture design approach \n\nwith linear squares regression (LSR) and ANN analysis. To evaluate its potential as a functional \n\nfood, the antioxidant activity of this beverage was compared with both commercial and \n\nlaboratory drinks. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2. Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n6.2.1 Chemicals \n\n \n\n2,2-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), Folin\u2013Ciocalteau reagent, gallic acid and Trolox were \n\npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. Ltd. (Poole, U.K.). Iron (III) chloride, sodium acetate, \n\nsodium carbonate, glacial acetic acid and 2,4,6-tripyridyl-2-triazine (TPTZ), were purchased \n\nfrom VWR (West Chester, PA). Absolute ethanol was purchased from Merck (Nottingham, \n\nU.K.). All reagents were of analytical grade.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n154 \n\n \n\n6.2.2. Preparation of the sweet potato extracts \n\n \n\nSweet potatoes were purchased at the local market, washed under tap water and air dried during \n\nthe night. Roots were peeled with a cut depth circa 1.5 mm in one direction with a hand peeler. \n\nSweet potato leaves were cut from vines collected from the field at Aljezur (Portugal), washed \n\nunder tap water and dried with paper towels. Peels and leaves were dried at 60 \u00baC in a Binder \n\nBD 53 incubator (Binder, Tuttilgen, Germany) during 48 h and 24 h, respectively. The dried \n\nmaterials were milled until all particles were smaller than 600 \u00b5 m (30 mesh). Extractions were \n\nperformed, in a screw cap flask (100 mL) in a stirring hot plate (HS0707V2, Favorit, Malaysia) \n\nstirred at constant speed of 200 rpm at 75 \u00baC during 45 min. A solid: solvent ratio of 16.7 \n\nmg/mL was used for peels and 8.3 mg/mL for leaves. After filtration with a vacuum pump \n\naspirator (DOA-P604-BN, Cast Manufacturing Inc., USA) and centrifugation (Hettich \n\nUniversal  320, Tuttlingen, Germany) at 3000 g for  10 min,  SPPE and SPLE  were  stored at \n\n-18 \u00baC. \n\n \n\n6.2.3. Preparation of the honey solution \n\n \n\nRosemary honey from regional origin was purchase in the local market. Because beverage \n\nmixtures were prepared by volume for formulation convenience, a honey solution (HonS) was \n\nused with a concentration of 0.535 g/mL. It presented soluble solids (SS) of 44 \u00baBrix measured \n\nby a pocket digital refractometer (Pocket Pal-1 ATAGO, Japan). \n\n \n\n6.2.4. Beverage evaluation \n\n \n\nTotal phenolic content (TPC), ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and DPPH (2,2-\n\nDiphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity were determined according to the \n\nmethod described by Prieto et al. (1999), Benzie and Strain (1996) and Blois (1958), \n\nrespectively, with minor adaptations indicated in Nunes et al. (2012). TPC was expressed in \n\nmg of gallic acid equivalent (GAE) by 1 L of beverage, while FRAP and DPPH assays in mg \n\nof Trolox equivalent (TE) by 1L of beverage. All absorbance readings were made in a T70+ \n\nUV/Vis Spectrometer (PG Instruments Ltd, United Kingdom). SS were measured as indicated \n\nfor honey solution. Determinations were carried out in triplicate and data were reported as mean \n\n\u00b1 standard deviation. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n155 \n\n \n\n6.2.5. Experimental design and statistical analysis  \n\n \n\nThe experimental plan comprising a total of 24 runs was obtained using a I-optimal randomized \n\nmixture design for three components, SPPE, SPLE and HonS (Table 6.1). The proportional \n\nlevels of components were set at 0.5-1.0 (50-100 %) for SPPE and 0-0.5 (0-50 %) for both \n\nSPLE and Hon.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was computed to determine \n\ncoefficients significance. Diagnostic tools such as normal plot of the residuals distribution, \n\noutlier detection and Box\u2013Cox plots were computed to check models adequacy. The coefficient \n\nof determination (R2) and adjusted coefficient of determination (R2Adj) were used to access \n\nmodels performance. For the analysis by ANN, a simple single layer structure was used with \n\nthe three components SPPE, SPLE and HonS as inputs, one hidden layer with three nodes and \n\nTPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS as outputs (Figure 6.1). The data were divided into two \n\nsubsets, training and validation and network topology was trained by k-fold cross validation \n\nmethod (k=6). Inputs were multiplied by weights and computed by hyperbolic-tangent \n\nactivation function in the hidden layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer was adjusted \n\niteratively to maximize performance fitting determined by R2 and root mean squared error \n\n(RMSE). Optimization was performed by maximizing the desirability function. To compare \n\nSPPE beverage with other antioxidant beverages, data was represented by Box\u2013Cox plots. \n\nJMP\u00ae Pro 10.0.2 software (www.jmp.com) provided at no cost by SAS (www.sas.com) was \n\nused in the design of experiments, data analysis and creation of the graphics, except Figure 6.2 \n\nwhich was made with Microsoft\u00ae Excel 2013. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.1.

Results and discussion \n\n \n\n6.3.1. Beverage concept and components selection \n\n \n\nThe concept associated to the SPPE functional beverage was to provide a product based on \n\nsweet potato wastes, rich in antioxidants and sweetened with HonS. Valorisation of SPPE was \n\nthe driving force of this study and the inclusion of SPLE reinforces product appeal regarding \n\nrecycling and sustainability. A common limiting factor in waste valorisation is its practical \n\nsuitability (Peschel et al. 2006). The direct use of SPPE as they are obtained by aqueous \n\nextraction in the liquid form addresses this issue. A sweetener was added to the beverage \n\nformula to mask the probable astringency related to its high phenolic content. HonS was chosen \n\nbecause it also contributes to antioxidant activity. \n\n \n\n6.3.2. Component levels selection \n\n \n\nRestrictions on mixture components were established according to beverage concept. Thus, as \n\nthe functional beverage was intended to be based on sweet potato peels, a minimum of 50 % \n\nwas established for this component. Its upper level was set to maximum (100 %) to gain a better \n\nknowledge of its potential. The other two components, SPLE and HonS were then varied in the \n\nremaining design space, between 0 and 50 %. \n\n \n\n6.3.3. Mixture design selection \n\n \n\nThe study objective was to optimize a beverage formulation based on predictive models. The \n\nselection of the mixture design selection had to incorporate the restriction applied to SPPE \n\n(minimum of 50 %). Optimal designs efficiency is based on providing a high reliability of \n\ninformation with a reduced number of runs. I-optimal designs are adequate for the objective of \n\nthis study because the average variance is minimized over restricted design region (Yeh et al. \n\n2010). The number of run replicates was chosen so the Scheff\u00e9 polynomial model could be \n\nused to fit experimental data. It was observed that the antioxidant activity of a combination of \n\nfoods may not be equal to the weighted sum of the antioxidant activity derived from the \n\nindividual components (Wang et al. 2011). With this model, cross terms were included to access \n\nsynergistic or antagonistic effects beside the linear main-effect terms. \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n158 \n\n \n\n6.3.4. Design responses selection \n\n \n\nAlthough in vitro antioxidant assays lack specificity, they are useful to access the potential of \n\na new product at the initial stages of development. TPC based on Folin-Ciocalteau reagent, \n\nDPPH assay and FRAP were chosen as design responses mainly because they are profusely \n\nused in food products such as beverages. FRAP was considered a reasonable screen assay for \n\nthe ability to maintain redox status in cells or tissues but for DPPH radical, no similarity to the \n\nhighly reactive radicals involved in lipid peroxidation was found (Prior et al. 2005). These \n\nresponses allowed the characterization of the antioxidant function present in beverage \n\nformulations by different reaction mechanisms. The FRAP mechanism is totally electron \n\ntransfer while DPPH radical may be neutralized either by electron transfer or by hydrogen atom \n\ntransfer (radical quenching) (Prior et al. 2005). Soluble solids were also included as a response \n\nas an indicator of formulations sweetness/perceived astringency. \n\n \n\n6.3.5 Beverage formula modelling \n\n \n\nTo proceed modelling by LSR method, pseudo-components defined as XSPPE=((SPPE-\n\n0.5)/0.5), XSPLE=(SPLE/0.5) and XHonS=(HonS/0.5) were used. After running diagnostic plots \n\n(data not shown), no data transformation was required and outliers detected in each response \n\nwere not considered for modelling. According to ANOVA results (Table 6.2), all models were \n\nsignificant (P&lt;0.001) and presented non-significant lack of fit. The significance, sign and \n\nmagnitude of the coefficients of the model depicted in Figure 6.2 can assess the impact of \n\nbeverage components in each response. The coefficient estimate of the linear terms XSPPE, \n\nXSPLE and XHonS represented the fitted response at the three vertices of the triangle while the \n\ncoefficients of the cross terms XSPPE*XSPLE, XSPPE*XHonS, XSPLE*XHonS and XSPPE*XSPLE*XHonS \n\nwere indicative of the curvature across each edge of the factor space. Synergistic or antagonistic \n\neffects of component pairs could be evaluated by positive or negative coefficients of the cross \n\nterms. For the TPC model, all linear pseudo-components were significant (P&lt;0.001) and had \n\na positive contribution. XSPLE term presented 1.2 times more effect than XSPPE or XHonS.  \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n\n159 \n\n \n\nTable 6.2.

Therefore, the overall pseudo components effects order for  TPC  was  XSPLE  >  XSPPE  ~  \n\nXHonS  >  XSPLE*XHonS  > XSPPE*XHonS. Regarding antioxidant activity, linear terms were \n\nsignificant (P&lt;0.001) and had a positive contribution on both FRAP and DPPH assay. A \n\nsynergetic effect between XSPPE and XSPLE was observed for DPPH assay with a magnitude \n\nmore than 1.7 lower than the respective individual terms. As this effect was not significant for \n\nFRAP, the synergetic interaction between phenolics from sweet potato leaves and peels may \n\nbe more related to a radical quenching mechanism. Thus, FRAP model presented an positive \n\neffect order of XSPLE > XSPPE > XHonS while overall pseudo components effects order for DPPH \n\nassay was XSPLE > XSPPE > XHonS ~ XSPPE*XSPLE. As expected, pseudo-components effect on SS \n\nwas quite different than for the other responses. XHonS was the dominant significant term but \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n161 \n\n \n\nXSPPE also presented a positive contribution although much smaller in magnitude. TPC, FRAP, \n\nDPPH assays and SS models presented R2 values higher than 0.94 (Table 6.2). As R2Adj values \n\nwere in line with R2, models fitting quality was considered high. In summary, SPLE was the \n\ncomponent with highest influence on beverage phenolic content and antioxidant activity, \n\nfollowed by SPPE and HonS. HonS played the major influence in SS response with SPPE \n\ncontributing also to the beverage perceived sweetness. SPPE, SPLE and HonS when combined \n\nat the levels of the mixture design presented predominantly positive effects regarding the \n\nbeverage antioxidant activity. The interactions of SPPE with HonS and of SPPE with HonS \n\nwere significantly synergetic for TPC were significant for. SPPE and SPLE presented also a \n\nsignificantly synergetic effect for DPPH assay. No significant antagonistic effects were \n\nobserved. Predictive equations were depicted in Table 6.3 and represented in ternary plots in \n\nFigure 6.3. The ANN approach provided more complex predictive models than LSR (Table \n\n6.2) as outliers were not removed and components were used as such (not transformed into \n\npseudo-components).  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6.3.

This constrain in SS corresponded to the overall SS mean of commercial and \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n164 \n\n \n\nlaboratory prototype beverages with antioxidant activity. With the optimization criteria C1, the \n\noptimal formula obtained from LSR models was 50.0 % of SPPE, 36.2 % of SPLE and 13.8 % \n\nof HonS (Figure 6.5) with predicted responses of 323 \u00b1 3 mg GAE/L, 572 \u00b1 30 mg TE/L, 1391 \n\n\u00b1 72 mg TE/L and 6.5 \u00b1 0.6 \u00baBrix for TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS, respectively. The \n\ndesirability value was 0.588 and optimum was located in an extreme of the design space. \n\nSimilar results were obtained by ANN models (Figure 6.5). The optimal formulation by ANN \n\nmodels was 50.0 % of SPPE, 38.3 % of SPLE and 11.2 % of HonS and predicted responses \n\nwere of 331 mg GAE/L for TPC, 582 mg TE/L for FRAP, 1469 mg TE/L for DPPH assay and \n\n5.7 \u00baBrix for SS. Using C2 optimization criteria, the design space for optimization was reduced \n\nso SPPE could vary between 50 and 70 %, SPLE between 0 and 23 % and HonS between 27 \n\nand 50%. With this constraint, the optimized beverage formula was 50.0 % SPPE, 22.1 % SPLE \n\nand 27.9 % HonS. Predicted values for TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS were (308 \u00b1 10) mg \n\nGAE/L, 483 \u00b1 38 mg TE/L, 1106 \u00b1 8 mg TE/L and 12.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00baBrix, respectively. By increasing \n\nHonS component 1.2 times, the antioxidant activity decreased 17 % for FRAP and 22 % for \n\nDPPH assay. The value of the desirability function for the formula obtained by C2 (0.543) was \n\nsimilar to C1 and had higher probable taste acceptability. Using ANN models, optimum was \n\nsimilar to LSR models, with 50.0 % SPPE, 21.5 % SPLE and 28.5 % HonS as optimal formula. \n\nPredicted responses were of 309 mg GAE/L for TPC, 476 mg TE/L for FRAP, 1098 mg TE/L \n\nfor DPPH assay and 12.3 \u00baBrix for SS. There were no relevant differences between LSR and \n\nANN optimization results, thus future developments should use predictive equations obtained \n\nwith higher efficiency. As all runs of the mixture design was used in ANN modelling, the \n\nchosen optimized beverage prototype formula was 50.0% SPPE, 21.5 % SPLE and 28.5 % \n\nHonS. \n\n \n\n6.3.7.

Optimal SPP beverage formula for criteria C1 (no restrains) and C2 (SS > 12.3 \n\u00baBrix) obtained by a) LSR models and b) ANN models. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe commercial antioxidant beverages considered were fruit juices (Gonz\u00e1lez?Molina et al. \n\n2012, Pulido et al. 2003, Seeram et al. 2008, de Beer et al. 2012, Pellegrini et al. 2003), \n\nvegetable juices (Wootton-Beard and Ryan 2012), herbal infusions (Ho et al. 2010, Bravo et \n\nal. 2007, Pellegrini et al. 2003) and teas (Bravo et al. 2007, Pulido et al. 2003, Ho et al. 2010). \n\nThree laboratory beverages were also used for comparison, a plum peel enriched nectar (de \n\nBeer et al. 2012), a cardio protection fruit beverage (Gunathilake et al. 2013) and a nutraceutical \n\nfruit juice (Lawless et al. 2012). The range of TPC response for SPPE beverage was within fruit \n\njuices range of variation but it was lower than the other commercial and laboratory beverages \n\n(Figure 6.6). Regarding SPPE beverage antioxidant activity, FRAP range was within herbal \n\ninfusion and tea, and above vegetable juice variations. However, DPPH assay box-plot showed \n\nthat SPPE beverage overlapped fruit juice variation and was higher than vegetable juice and \n\nplum peel enriched beverage. Finally, SS box plots confirmed HonS component selected levels \n\nas adequate. In general, SPPE beverage benchtop prototype was competitive to fruit and \n\nvegetable juices regarding antioxidant activity. It presented however less phenolics than the \n\ncommercial and laboratory beverages used for comparison.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 6 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n166 \n\n \n\n \n \nFigure 6.6.

Beverage categories: FJ; fruit juice; VJ, vegetable \njuice; HI, herbal infusion; T, tea; PPE, plum peel enriched nectar; CP; cardio protective \nbeverage; NJ, nutraceutical juice; SPP Bev, sweet potato peel beverage. \n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.4. Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe optimized formula obtained by ANN models for the SPPE beverage benchtop prototype \n\nwas 50.0 % of SPPE, 21.5 % of SPLE and 28.5 % of HonS. TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays and SS \n\npredicted responses for the optimal formula were 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, 1098  mg \n\nTE/L and 12.3 \u00baBrix, respectively. LSR models revealed that components presented positive \n\neffect on TPC, FRAP, DPPH assays in the order SPLE>SPPE>HonS. Synergetic effects were \n\nobserved between SPPE and HonS and SPLE and HonS for TPC. The interaction between \n\nSPPE and SPLE was synergetic for DPPH method. Antagonist effects in all responses were not \n\nsignificant (P> 0.05).

The commencing stages involve the conversion \n\nof an essential concept often originated from academic research into a prototype. A framework \n\nfor the valorisation of agro wastes into a food application through the development of a \n\nbenchtop prototype with added value was applied to sweet potato (SP). A functional beverage \n\nwith attributes related to oxidative stress protection was developed using sweet potato peels \n\n(SPP) and sweet potato leaves (SPL) as components. The developing processes involved the \n\nfollowing steps: literature and patent review, preliminary study, key factors screening, \n\nextraction optimization and beverage formula optimization. Total phenolic content and \n\nantioxidant activity used to evaluate experiments was measured by Folin-Ciocalteau method \n\nand in vitro screening assays, respectively. \n\n \n\nLiterature review for the period 2003-2014 showed that SPP presented lower research amount \n\non phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity then SPL. SPP also presented a lower number \n\nof patented food products than SPL for the same period of time. In vitro antioxidant activity \n\nwas mainly evaluated by the DPPH assay. The experimental designs used in research were \n\npredominantly the comparative type and design of experiments was used in reduced number. \n\nFlour/powder was the most studied food application with health benefits in articles while for \n\nbeverage was the top patented food. The enhancement of antioxidant defence was a health \n\nbenefit established for SPL by clinical trials while for SPP they were no studies. An antioxidant \n\nbeverage was the elected food application with health benefits for the valorisation of SPP and \n\nSPL. Text mining analysis on articles and patents abstracts could show the state of the art \n\nregarding SP food applications by dendograms and co-occurrence networks.  \n\n \n\nA preliminary study on phenolic content and antioxidant activity of sweet potato vines by a \n\nfactorial design revealed that plant part (stems or leaves) presented the largest main significant \n\neffect (P &lt;0.001) on TPC, TFC, TAA, RP and FRAP while for DPPH assay solvent was the \n\nmost influential factor. Time of extraction presented a significant effect only on RP assay, as \n\nmain effect and interaction with plant part. SPL flour reached up to 122 \u00b1 0.07 mg GAE/g dw \n\nfor TPC, 0.59 \u00b1 0.05 g QE/100 g dw for TFC, 1.06 \u00b1 036 g AAE/100 g dw for TAA, 50.8 \u00b1 \n\n2.2 g GAE/100 g dw for RP, 29.3 \u00b1 2.8 mM TE/g dw for FRAP and 7.9 \u00b1 2.0 mM TE/g dw for \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n173 \n\n \n\nDPPH method. Principal components analysis revealed that TFC, TPC, RP and FRAP were \n\nhighly correlated while TAA was more correlated with DPPH assay.  \n\n \n\nThe extraction of phenolic compounds with antioxidant activity from SPP flour was screened \n\nby a Plackett-Burman design to select key factors among nine variables such as solvent: solid \n\nratio, time, pH, peeling cut depth, particle size, temperature, solvent, sample amount and \n\nagitation. Solvent: solid ratio and peel cut depth presented similar effect size but opposite \n\ndirection (positive and negative, respectively) on TPC (p &lt;0.05). These two factors had a \n\nsimilar effect size on FRAP. Regression models revealed significant main effects and two \n\nfactors interactions for FRAP but not for TPC. After transformation of FRAP by the squared \n\nroot function, sample size was selected by the stepwise regression procedure as main effect and \n\nin interaction with solvent: solid ratio. In addition, a small positive influence of pH in \n\ninteraction with solvent: solid ratio on antioxidant activity was observed. TPC and FRAP \n\npresented a Pearson a correlation (R) of 0.77. \n\n \n\nIn the development stage regarding extraction optimization, phenolic compounds with ABTS \n\nand DPPH radical scavenging activities from SPP flour were modelled and optimized by a CCD \n\nexperimental plan. In decreasing order, temperature factor, the interaction between solvent: \n\nsolid and temperature factors, and solvent: solid factor presented positive effects on TPC and \n\nABTS methods. An inverse order was observed for DPPH assay. Optimized extraction \n\nconditions obtained by both RSM and ANN were 60 mL/g, 30 min and 75 \u00baC. The obtained \n\nresponses at the optimized conditions were as follow: 11.87 \u00b1 0.69 mg GAE/g DM for TPC, \n\n12.91 \u00b1 0.42 mg TE/g DM for ABTS method and 46.35 \u00b1 3.08 mg TE/g DM for DPPH method. \n\nSPP presented similar behaviour in both optimal conditions and phenolic content obtained from \n\npeels of potato, peels of tea fruit and peels of bambangan (mango).  \n\n \n\nThe optimized formula for the antioxidant beverage benchtop prototype obtained by ANN \n\nmodels was 50.0 % of SPPE, 21.5 % of SPLE and 28.5 % of HonS. Predicted  results for the \n\noptimal formula on TPC, FRAP, DPPH assay and SS were 309 mg GAE/L, 476 mg TE/L, 1098  \n\nmg TE/L and 12.3 \u00baBrix, respectively. LSR models revealed that components presented positive \n\neffect on TPC, FRAP and DPPH assays in the order SPLE>SPPE>HonS. Synergetic effects \n\nwere observed between SPPE and HonS and SPLE and HonS for TPC. The interaction between \n\nSPPE and SPLE was synergetic for DPPH assay. Antagonist effects in all responses were not \n\n\n\nChapter 7 \n\n \nAntioxidant and Phenolic Compounds in Sweet Potato Peels and Leaves:  \n\nFood Applications and Health Benefits \n174 \n\n \n\nsignificant (P> 0.05). The beverage benchtop prototype was positioned next to commercial \n\nvegetable and fruit beverages in terms of antioxidant activity. Further research on beverage \n\ncomposition is relevant before initiating studies on product quality, safety and stability. \n\n \n\nThese findings reduced knowledge gaps on the field of food application with health benefits \n\nrelated to SPL and especially SPP. Predictive models from this study may help researchers in \n\ntheir functional food development processes. Transfer of this knowledge to food processors \n\nmay help transform SPP and SPL from a liability to an asset through their valorisation into \n\ninnovative products for the market of health and wellness. \n\n."}]}}}
