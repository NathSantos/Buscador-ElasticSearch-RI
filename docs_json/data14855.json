Exploiting the principles of constitutive theory, few expedient assumptions, and,\nin special, the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle, a thermo-electrochemical continuum model\nis proposed for electrolyte solutions as well as for the bulk and double layer regions of\nan electrochemical system. The influence of ion-ion and ion-solvent interactions on the\nmixture dynamics is taken into account through the thermodynamics of polar materials\nand balance laws for an electrochemical system are accordingly stated. In addition, phe-\nnomenological equations are schemed for a dilute and isotropic electrolyte solution, and\nthe conditions for local thermodynamic equilibrium of bulk and double layer regions are\ninvestigated. Comparing the residual entropy inequalities obtained for each region of an\nelectrochemical system, it is shown that some mechanisms develop only in the double\nlayer, such as the thermal diffusion, thermoelectricity and electrophoresis phenomena. As\na consequence, the local thermodynamic equilibrium state in the double layer requires\nstricter conditions than in the bulk. Although the constitutive equations are the simplest\npossible, the constitutive models proposed for the double layer and bulk regions are physi-\ncally consistent and more comprehensive than the usual models since the emerging equa-\ntions do not constrain themselves to equilibrium neither limiting conditions. Therefore, the\nthermodynamic description provided in this work may stimulate chemists and chemical\nengineers to take advantage of it to study the flow of ions and other chemical species\nacross cell membranes, ionic mobility in bio and geological media, and processes whose\nheat and mass transfers are enhanced by electromagnetic fields.\nKEYWORDS: Thermodynamic modeling, Electrochemistry, Mu?ller-Liu entropy, diffusion-\nmathematical models, mechanics of continuous media.\n\nxi\n\n\n\nxii\n\n\n\nRESUMO\n\nMODELAGEM CONSTITUTIVA DE SISTEMAS ELETROQUI?MICOS ATRAVE?S DO\nPRINCI?PIO DE ENTROPIA MU?LLER-LIU- Este trabalho descreve a termodina?mica de\nsistemas eletroqu??micos.

In 1887, van\u2019t Hoff [69] published a work,\nreporting deviations in the values of freezing points, boiling points, osmotic pressure, and\nvapor pressures for electrolyte solutions. Few months later, Arrhenius [1] suggested that\ncharged chemical species should be present in electric-conducting solutions, even in the\nabsence of external electric fields.\n\nFrom van\u2019t Hoff and Arrhenius\u2019 works, several studies [76] showed that the interi-\nonic forces should play an important role in the physico-chemical properties of electrolyte\nsolutions. This became more evident when the results obtained from conductometric and\namperometric experiments indicated that the nature and concentration of ions change the\nconductivity, viscosity, and mass transport of solutions. Since then, many attempts [3]\nhave been made to derive theories of interionic interaction, being most of them based\non statistical mechanics whose focus relies on the time-averaged spatial distribution of\nions. According to these models, a volume element of the solution is completely filled\nwith a dielectric continuum, where discrete point charges, regarded as hard spheres, are\nimmersed. Evidently, these approximations are shortcomings because real ions are not\nhard spheres, and the solvent is not a dielectric continuum. However, in the limit of very\ndilute solutions, these approximations are acceptable, as Debye and Hu?ckel demonstrated\nin reference [18].\n\nIn the Debye-Hu?ckel model, thermodynamic properties of the solution are calcu-\nlated from the electrostatic interaction energy between an ion, chosen as a reference one,\nand all other ions in solution. In order to determine this interaction energy, one consid-\ners that the averaged distribution of ions around the reference ion follows the Boltzmann\ndistribution law, whereas the relation between the charge density of each ion and the\nelectrostatic potential is given by the Poisson\u2019s equation. The combination of these two\nequations leads to the so-called Poisson-Boltzmann equation, which, in general, is solved\nby numerical or series methods. To make further progress, Debye and Hu?ckel focused on\nsystems where the average electrostatic potential energy is much smaller than the ther-\n\n1\n\n\n\nmal one, allowing the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to be linearized and solved analytically.\nHowever, despite the great contribution of the Debye-Hu?ckel model to the development of\na coherent interionic theory, it provides theoretical results that are in good agreement with\nexperimental data for only very dilute solutions.\n\nIn view of the limitations of the Debye-Hu?ckel model, other theoretical models\nbased on more realistic assumptions have been developed. Some of these models, for\ninstance, are founded on the use of the unlinearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation [25, 27,\n51], the virial expansion of the excess Gibbs energy (Pitzer equation) [52, 53], and the\nintermolecular potential theory (McMillan-Mayer theory) [38]. Nevertheless, despite the\nimpressive success reached by these models, the lack of data about ionic and molecular\nradii, dielectric saturation, and electrostriction effects has hindered their application in\nmore complex systems. Even with the advances in computational molecular dynamics, the\ndetermination of thermodynamic properties of simple electrolyte solutions is frequently a\nlong and tedious process as it requires several computer cycles per chemical species. As\na result, continuum models for mixtures have become an alternative approach, especially\nwith the progresses obtained in electrorheological fluids and continuum mixtures models\nduring the last decades. For instance, Maugin and co-authors [42, 43] developed various\ncontinuum models to study the behavior of polyelectrolytes in non-homogeneous velocity\ngradient flows, either in the presence or absence of electric fields. Moreover, several\ncontinuum models have been developed in order to associate the material properties of\nelectrorheological fluids to measurable macroscopic quantities.\n\nThe literature provides numerous works about constitutive modeling of polyelec-\ntrolytes, ionic polymer-metal composites, and electrorheological fluids with practical ap-\nplications in automotive industries, polishing solutions, biomedical devices etc. In refer-\nences [55, 77], phenomenological models of ion transport were given with basis in linear\nirreversible thermodynamics. In reference [50], Placidi and co-authors provided a con-\ntinuum model for polymer-metal composites, where chemically induced deformations are\ndescribed through a distortion field induced by solvated ions. However, although several\ncontinuum models are available for electrolyte mixtures, the most fundamental aspects of\nelectrolyte dynamics have not been sufficiently explored. Hence, the aim of this work is\nto propose a general thermo-electrochemical theory to investigate the diffusive, reactive,\nand advective structures of dilute electrolyte solutions. These solutions present close con-\nnection with the fields of surface chemistry (the stability of many colloids depends on the\ninterionic interactions in solution), biochemistry (blood is an ion carrier and changes in the\nions concentrations affect the blood flow), metallurgy (successful electroplating processes\nrequire the control of ions transport in solutions), and geology (soils with high concen-\n\n2\n\n\n\ntration of ions flow faster), and differ from the polyelectrolyte ones because they do not\ncontain ionic or polarizable macromolecules, but only monoatomic or molecular ions of\nlow molecular weight.\n\nChapter 2 is devoted to the presentation of the foundations of continuum ther-\nmodynamics. Particularly, attention is focused on the continuum concept, basic laws of\nPhysics, and principles of the constitutive theory. Here, the concept of continuum particle\nis also differentiated from the classical concept of particles in Chemistry and Physics. In\nChapter 3, the dynamics of reacting ionic mixtures is outlined by emphasizing the rela-\ntion between inner structure of the mixture and interionic interactions. In turn, the next\ntwo chapters are dedicated to exploitation of the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle for electro-\nchemical systems. In Chapter 4, thermodynamic restrictions on constitutive functions and\ntheir consequences for dilute electrolyte solutions whose constituents present the same\ntemperature field are shown. In order to assess the implications of this constitutive theory\nfor electrolyte solutions, some results are compared with those of classical thermostatics.\nFinally, in Chapter 5, some comments are addressed to the structure of electrochemi-\ncal systems, and continuum models for the double layer and bulk regions are developed.\nFrom these models, transport phenomena in the bulk and double layer are investigated\nand compared, and the implications of material equations on the properties of each re-\ngion are discussed.\n\nDespite the continuum models proposed are limited to electrochemical systems,\nthe results presented can be extended to study the flow of ions and other chemical species\nacross cell membranes, ionic mobility in bio and geological media, and processes whose\nheat and mass transfers are enhanced by electromagnetic fields.\n\n3\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n2 Foundations of Continuum\nThermodynamics\n\nContinuum thermodynamics is a branch of physical science concerned with deformations\nand motions of continuous material media under the influence of mechanical, electro-\nmagnetic, thermal, and chemical sources. Since mid-1960, the continuum approach for\nmaterial bodies has been an important theoretical tool for engineers and applied mathe-\nmaticians because it provides a very useful and reliable representation for macroscopic\nbodies whose characteristic dimensions are much bigger than the molecular ones. On\nthe other hand, most of the chemists are still not aware of the methods of continuum\nthermodynamics as an alternative to traditional thermodynamic theories.\n\nThe subsequent sections are destined to present the basic concepts of continuum\nthermodynamics whose phenomenology is restricted to the Newtonian space-time,\n\n^ : W ?E \u00d7R , (2.0.1)\n\nwhere ^ is a frame of reference or observer, E is the three-dimensional Euclidean space ,\nand R is the one-dimensional space of real numbers. For a complete overview of the foun-\ndations of continuum thermodynamics, the readers are advised to consult the references\n[29, 35, 47, 68].\n\n2.1 The continuum concept\n\nOn a small scale, an aluminum sheet is a collection of discrete aluminum atoms stacked\non one another in a repetitive lattice. On an even smaller scale, the aluminum atoms\nconsist of a core of protons and neutrons around which electrons move. Thus, clearly,\nmatter is not continuous. However, if the continuum concept of matter is accepted, one\nignores the discrete composition of material bodies and assumes that the mass of such\nbodies is distributed throughout, so filling the whole space that it occupies. In keeping with\nthis continuum model, matter may be divided indefinitely into smaller and smaller portions,\n\n5\n\n\n\neach of which retains all the physical properties of the original body. Accordingly, physical\nquantities, such as energy and velocity, are ascribed to every single point of the region of\nspace that the body occupies as continuous functions or piecewise continuous functions\nof space and time.\n\nIn continuum thermodynamics, the mass of a body is a fundamental physical prop-\nerty, and it is a priori assigned as a part of the specification of a continuous body. Hence,\nconsider a finite part P of a body. For all points inside P, the mass density ? is defined by\nthe limit\n\n? (\u00b7) = lim\nV?0\n\nm\n\nV\n> 0 , (2.1.1)\n\nwhere m is a non-negative scalar measure, named the mass distribution of P, V is the\nvolume of P, and ? is independent of the size of P, but depends on position and time.\n\nMoreover, classical continuum thermodynamic theories, also known as local con-\ntinuum theories, are based on the fundamental hypothesis that the state of a body at\nany material point is influenced only by the infinitesimal neighborhood of that point. This\nassumption eliminates the long-range effect of loads on the motion and on the evolution\nof the state of the body, as well as ignores the effect of long-range interactions among\nphysical particles. In fact, this premise is valid for a class of materials where experimen-\ntal probes measure the average outcome on some spatial and/or temporal domains over\nwhich non-local variations of fields are small and external applied loads are often very\nsmooth. But, for another class of materials, such as blood, polymeric substances, solids\nwith micro-cracks, fluids in a state of turbulence, liquid crystals etc. classical continuum\ntheories do not give reliable predictions since the individual response of the constituents\nof the body becomes important, so that the hypothesis of locality fails.\n\nThe departure from local theories begins with polar theories, initially proposed by\nthe Cosserat brothers in 1909 [15]. According to them, the material points are considered\ngeometrical points that possess properties similar to rigid particles (micropolar media) or\ndeformable particles (micromorphic media). These properties are then introduced through\nindependent degrees of freedom provided by a set of vectors or even by tensors of order\nbigger than two, resulting in higher-order polar theories. Nevertheless, this process soon\nceases to be useful because the consequent field equations become increasingly compli-\ncated. Conversely, polar theories of the first order (micropolar and micromorphic theories)\nare simple enough and have found important applications in a variety of materials as previ-\nously mentioned, although they are not expected to bridge the gap between macroscopic\nand atomic physics. For this purpose, it is necessary to construct non-local theories in\nwhich a finite neighborhood of a material point influences the response at that point or\n\n6\n\n\n\neven mesoscopic theories, where macroscopic quantities are obtained from a statistical\ndistribution function.\n\n2.2 Motion of a body\n\nThe starting point of continuum thermodynamics is a material body B, which consists of\ninfinite material points or particles X, considered primitive elements. In order to describe\nthe presence of a continuum body B in the space, one maps B on a region of the three-\ndimensional Euclidean space E,\n\n? : B ?E , (2.2.1)\n\nfor some configuration ?. Usually, ? is some particular configuration of B referred to as the\nreference configuration, while ?t is the current configuration at time t.\n\nOnce the presence of B in the space has been defined, the motion of a material\nbody may be investigated. In the reference configuration, a referential or material coor-\ndinate X is assigned to the particle X. Nonetheless, when a continuum body moves or\ndeforms with time, the body particles found at positions X in the reference configuration\n? occupy new positions x after certain time t. These new positions occupied by the body\nparticles in the current configuration ?t are denominated spatial coordinates. Then, the\nmotion ? of a particle can be mathematically described as\n\n? : B? \u00d7R+ ?Bt , (2.2.2)\n\n(X, t) 7? x = ? (X, t) ,\n\nsuch that ? is invertible,\n\nX = ??1 (x, t) , (2.2.3)\n\nand B? and Bt represent the body B in the configuration ? and ?t, respectively. In other\nterms, Equation (2.2.3) implies that, if all positions x in Bt and the motion ? (X, t) are\nknown, the positions of the particles in the reference configuration can be determined.\n\nEvidently, different observers may measure space-time events in different ways.\nHowever, as this work only deals with the framework of Newtonian mechanics, the distance\nand time intervals between events must have the same values in two reference frames\nwhose relative motion is rigid. That is, let a change of reference frame, ?, from a non-\n\n7\n\n\n\nstarred observer to a starred observer\n\n? : E \u00d7R+ ?E \u00d7R+ , (2.2.4)\n\n? : (x, t) 7? (x?, t?) ,\n\nsuch that the observers follow an event in terms of position and time with proper measuring\ndevices. Of course, they may use different measuring instruments and obtain distinct\nresults for the same event. But, if one imposes that these observers must use measuring\ndevices with the same units of measure, they should obtain the same distance and time\nlapse between two events under consideration, although the values of the parameters\nmeasured may be different. Mathematically, this is expressed as\n\nx? = Q(t) (x ? xo) + c (t) , (2.2.5)\n\nt? = t + a,\n\nwhere a ? R+, xo ? E, c (t) is an arbitrary time-dependent vector, and Q(t) ? O (V ),\nsuch that Q(t) is a time-dependent orthogonal transformation and O (V ) is the orthogonal\ngroup on a vector space V .\n\nA change of reference frame defined by Equation (2.2.5) is referred to as a Eu-\nclidean transformation, the most general form of a time-dependent rigid transformation\nbetween two reference systems moving relative to each other. Then, in the Newtonian\nspace-time one says that a physical quantity is objective or form-invariant under a change\nof observers given by Equation (2.2.5) if 1\n\nf? (t?) = f (t) , (2.2.6)\n\nf? (t?) = Q(t) f (t) ,\n\nF? (t?) = Q(t) F (t)Q(t)T ,\n\n1 The definition of objectivity of an observable quantity is more general. An observable quantity f is said\nto be form-invariant or objective with respect to some class of change of frame, if\n\nf (\u00b7?) = Q\u2020f (\u00b7) ,\n\nwhere Q\u2020 is an induced linear transformation on the m-th order tensor space of f. If the class of change\nof frame is given by Equation (2.2.5), then f is form-invariant or objective in relation to Euclidean trans-\nformations and Q\u2020 = Q(t).\n\n8\n\n\n\nwhere f (t), f (t), and F (t) are arbitrary scalar, vector, and second-order tensor physical\nquantities dependent on time. In other terms, if the physical quantities noted by two differ-\nent observers for the same event are interrelated through the transformation rules (2.2.6),\nthen they are objective or form-invariant. 2\n\nBesides, one may further restrict the generality of Equation (2.2.5) by imposing\nthat Q(t) is constant in time and c (t) is linear in time. Then, Equation (2.2.5) is rewritten\nas\n\nx? = Q(x ? xo) + yt + co , (2.2.7)\n\nt? = t + a,\n\nwhere y and co are arbitrary constant vectors in the three-dimensional Euclidean space\nE. Equation (2.2.7) is called a Galilean transformation, a subclass of Euclidean transfor-\nmations. Accordingly, every movement can be written in a unique way as a composition\nof rotation, translation, and uniform motion.\n\n2.3 General balance statements\n\nAs a result of the continuum hypothesis, a physical property G assigned to a finite part Pt\nof a continuum body Bt, such as energy, linear momentum or entropy, is defined by some\nequation analogous to Equation (2.1.1), i.e., as a density per unit mass or area at every\npoint inside Pt. In addition, any physical property may change with time through three\nkinds of mechanisms: the first one, named supply SG, whose actions are transmitted at\na distance from outside of the body, so that the whole volume of B is directly influenced;\nthe second mechanism, named flux FG, whose actions are transmitted from outside into\nthe body through its surface; and the last one, named production PG, whose actions occur\ninside the body itself. While the first and the last mechanisms are expressed by mass\ndensities, the second one is given by surface densities. Hence, the time rate of change for\na physical variable G of the body is written as\n\ndG\ndt\n\n= SG + FG + PG , (2.3.1)\n\nor, by the transport theorem [35],\n\n2 Hereafter, the adjectives objective and form-invariant will be always used to express objective quantities\nwith respect to Euclidean transformations.\n\n9\n\n\n\n??\n\n?t\n+ div (? ? v ? ??) ??? ??? = 0 , (2.3.2)\n\nwhere G =\n\u00b4\nPt\n? (x, t) dv, SG =\n\n\u00b4\nPt\n?? (x, t) dv, FG =\n\n\u00b4\n?Pt\n\n?? (x, t) nda, and PG =\n\u00b4\nPt\n?? (x, t) dv\n\nare equivalent to the sum of individual contributions of all particles contained in a part Pt\nof Bt, dv and da are volume and area elements, respectively, v is the barycentric velocity,\nand n is the outward unit normal vector to the boundary of the region Bt. Furthermore, the\nquantities ? , ?? , and ?? are tensor fields of order m, while ?? is a tensor field of order\nm + 1. Of course, if ? is a tensor field of order m = 0, the tensor product ? ? v should be\nunderstood as ?v.\n\nEquation (2.3.1) is the general balance equation of a field G in its integral form,\nwhereas Equation (2.3.2) is the general balance equation valid at a regular point x. Both\nequations can be interpreted as asserting that the variation rate of the quantity G in a part\nof Bt is affected by the supply and production of G, as well as by the flux FG through the\nboundary region ?Pt. Then, if the body is isolated, SG = 0, FG = 0, and PG = 0, such that\nG is constant in time and it is said to be conserved.\n\nOne can extend the observations above to a surface in a material body, where the\nphysical quantity experiences a discontinuity. Across this surface, called singular surface,\nthe general balance equation is\n\nJ?? (v \u00b7 n ?un)K ? J??K \u00b7 n = 0 , (2.3.3)\n\nwhere J?K = ?+ ? ?? stands for the jump of ? across the discontinuity surface, un is\nthe normal velocity or propagation speed of the singular surface, and, for the sake of\nconvention, n points into the positive-side of the surface. Nonetheless, if un = v \u00b7 n, then\nthe surface is termed material surface and Equation (2.3.3) becomes\n\nJ??K \u00b7 n = 0 . (2.3.4)\n\nPhysically, material surfaces differ from singular ones because the former are con-\nstituted by the same particles of the material body at all times, whereas singular surfaces\ndo not consist of the same particles of B at all instants t. Some examples of singular\nsurfaces are the interface between two immiscible liquids, the phase equilibrium between\ntwo fluids, the shock front in supersonic flows, among others.\n\n10\n\n\n\n2.4 Principles of constitutive theory\n\nIn continuum mechanics, material characterization is made by the establishment of some\nfunctional relations, called constitutive equations, among the constitutive variables. The\nselection of these variables and the restrictions on these equations are based on the prin-\nciples of constitution as well as on the basic laws of mechanics [29, 35, 37, 68]. Therewith,\none can restrict the generality of the constitutive functions and, if possible, to reduce them\nto a small number of coefficients whose values can be experimentally measured.\n\nThe principles of constitutive theory are:\n\nPRINCIPLE OF CAUSALITY\n\nThe principle of causality is intended for the selection of the independent constitutive vari-\nables of a material subjected to certain actions. In a material subjected to mechanical,\nthermal, electromagnetic and chemical sources, some observable changes may occur. At\nthe outset, one can select a set of independent observable changes as the effects pro-\nduced inside the body by such sources. Then, this is the set of independent constitutive\nvariables for a limited class of physical and chemical phenomena in the material. Once the\nindependent constitutive variables are selected, all other material properties included in\nthe balance equations are considered dependent constitutive variables, defined from the\nset of independent ones. Note that the balance equations also include external supplies,\nwhich are considered known actions. Usually, it is assumed that dependent constitutive\nvariables are not explicitly dependent on external supplies.\n\nOf course, the decision about including a constitutive variable into the dependent\nor independent set is taken in agreement with the physical effects that one intends to eval-\nuate. If a given variable at (x, t) can be solved in terms of other variables of the problem,\nan explicit functional mapping from the set of independent variables to the dependent one\ncan be settled. In general, this mapping is not one-to-one, but, for a large class of materi-\nals, the relation cause-and-effect is well-established within the domain of the experiment.\nConsequently, such relation can be used to distinguish the set of independent constitutive\nvariables from the set of dependent ones.\n\nFor instance, in a material body, thermomechanical effects are produced by mo-\ntion and thermal changes. Thus, the thermomechanical independent variables are usually\nthe temperature, velocity and its gradient, acceleration, and mass density. If the body re-\nsponds to electromagnetic stimuli, it may be polarized and/or magnetized, and it even may\nconduct electricity. These effects result from redistribution and motion of bound and free\ncharges and, therefore, it seems reasonable to consider the electric polarization vector,\n\n11\n\n\n\nthe electric current vector, and the density of free charges as independent variables. Here,\nit is worthwhile to point out that different constitutive models can arise for a given material\nsince the choice of independent and dependent variables is not unique.\n\nPRINCIPLE OF DETERMINISM\n\nThe principle of determinism only considers the dependence of the material behavior at\na particle X on particles Y ? B, and past and current events. Accordingly, the future\nphenomena concerning the behavior of the body are fully determined and observable\nonce all past motions of the body are known. As a direct result, quantum mechanical\nphenomena are excluded. Complying with this principle, constitutive equations may be\nwritten as\n\nC (X,t) = R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X) , (2.4.1)\n\nwhere C denotes an arbitrary constitutive quantity, R is the response functional or con-\nstitutive functional of C,?t is the history of ? up to time t, and s ? [0,?) stands for the\ntime-coordinate pointed from the present time t into the past.\n\nEquation (2.4.1) allows the description of non-local effects as well as memory\neffects in B. The argument ?t runs through all instants in the past, from t?? to the present\ntime t? 0, describing the memory or remembering capacity of a material in relation to ?t.\nIn turn, the dependence of the response functional on every material point of the body\nY ?B corresponds to non-local effects. Finally, the explicit dependence of R on X means\nthe inhomogeneity of the material body, that is, the response functional depends on the\nparticle X. However, if a response functional of B is the same for all X to a given reference\nconfiguration,\n\nC (\u00b7, t) = R(?t (Y,t?s)) , (2.4.2)\n\nand B is called a homogeneous body. In other terms, for an inhomogeneous body, the\nconstitutive quantity is expressed by (2.4.1), while for a homogeneous one, the constitutive\nquantity is given by (2.4.2).\n\nPRINCIPLE OF EQUIPRESENCE\n\nThis principle assigns equal rights to all response functionals to depend on all independent\nconstitutive variables. The principle of admissibility together with various approximations\nmay eliminate the dependence on some of these variables. But, until such is the case,\none should employ the same list of independent constitutive variables in all response\nfunctionals.\n\n12\n\n\n\nPRINCIPLE OF MATERIAL OBJECTIVITY\n\nJust as constitutive quantities depend on the material point and time, they are also depen-\ndent on the choice of the reference frame,\n\nC (X,t,?) = R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,?) . (2.4.3)\n\nNonetheless, the principle of material objectivity imposes that the response functional of\nany objective constitutive quantity C must be the same for any two observers related by\n(2.2.5),\n\nR? (\u00b7) = R(\u00b7) . (2.4.4)\n\nClearly, for any non-objective quantity, such as total energy density, velocity, ac-\nceleration, the spin tensor etc., Equation (2.4.4) does not need to hold. As a consequence,\nthey need to be replaced by objective quantities in the set of constitutive variables, which\ncan be done by adding, subtracting or associating other non-objective quantities [35].\n\nBesides imposing that constitutive quantities are independent of the observers,\nthe principle of material objectivity brings other immediate consequences on the response\nfunctionals. For the sake of simplicity, suppose that ?t is a scalar function e.g. temperature\nor mass density. Then, one has\n\nR(??t (Y,t\n? ?s) ,X,t?) = Q(t)R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t) , (2.4.5)\n\nor by recalling Equation (2.2.6)1,\n\nR(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t?) = Q(t)R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t) . (2.4.6)\n\nChoosing Q(t) = 1 and c (t) = xo, it follows from Equation (2.2.5) that\n\nx? = x , t? = t + a,\n\nfor any a ? R+. Therefore, Equation (2.4.6) takes the form\n\nR(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t + a) = R(?t (Y,t?s) ,X,t) , (2.4.7)\n\nwhence one concludes that the response functionals cannot depend explicitly on time. For\nthis reason, the time dependence in (2.4.1) and (2.4.2) has been omitted since the explicit\ndependence of R on t would imply the dependence on the choice of the reference frame.\n\nHere, it is worthwhile to remark that the principle of material objectivity should not\n\n13\n\n\n\nto be confused with the term objectivity [20]. The term objectivity denotes transformation\nproperties of given quantities, whereas the principle of material objectivity postulates the\ncomplete independence of the response functional of an objective constitutive quantity on\nthe reference frame.\n\nPRINCIPLE OF MATERIAL SYMMETRY\n\nCrystallographic orientations of a body give rise to symmetries in material properties,\nwhich must be accounted for in the constitutive functionals. In fact, one should expect\nthat the response functionals at two different configurations ? and ?\n\n?\nshould not be identi-\n\ncal, unless the material body presents a particular symmetry that makes it impossible to\ndistinguish the configurations ? and ?\n\n?\n. For example, the material properties of a body\n\nwith cubic symmetry must be invariant in relation to rotation of the reference configuration\n? by 90 degrees about one of the crystal axes. Referring to the body configuration after\nthis rotation to as ?\n\n?\n, the configurations ? and ?? are said to be materially indistinguishable,\n\nif\n\nR(\u00b7) = R? (\u00b7) , (2.4.8)\n\nand\n\n? (B) M?? ?? (B) , (2.4.9)\n\nwhere both configurations are associated through a linear material symmetry transforma-\ntion M that preserves the volume of the body with respect to ?. 3 Thus, physically, the\nprinciple of material symmetry indicates that the response functional of C in relation to a\nconfiguration ? of a material body cannot be distinguished from that in a configuration ??,\nprovided both configurations are related through a material symmetry transformation M.\n\nOf course, there are many linear transformations for a given configuration ? that\nsatisfy Equation (2.4.9) and imply Equation (2.4.8). One names all of these linear trans-\nformations as the material group symmetry, M? (V ). Hence, a material is called solid if\nthere exists an undistorted configuration ?? , such that the material group symmetry is the\northogonal group O (V ) or is contained in it:\n\nM? (V ) ?O (V ) . (2.4.10)\n\nIn turn, a material is a fluid if there exists any configuration ? and ??, where\n\n3 See Appendix I for more information about groups of symmetry.\n\n14\n\n\n\nM? (V ) = U (V ) . (2.4.11)\n\nTherefore, unlike solids, fluids do not present a preferred configuration.\nOne may indeed particularize the symmetry conditions above to describe the ma-\n\nterial properties of isotropic, anisotropic, and hemitropic bodies. Hereby, one defines:\n\n\u2022 An isotropic body is a body whose material group symmetry is either equal to the\nunimodular group or equal to the orthogonal group,\n\nM? (V ) = O (V ) , M? (V ) = U (V ) .\n\nOtherwise, any other materials whose material group symmetry is not the orthogonal\ngroup neither the unimodular group are called anisotropic.\n\n\u2022 Generally, anisotropic bodies possess material symmetries that can be represented\nby directions, lines or planes. In doing so, anisotropic bodies can be defined as\ntransversely isotropic and orthotropic bodies, among other classes of symmetry. For\ninstance, if the material symmetry group satisfies the condition\n\nM1? (V ) = {Q?O (V ) | Qn = n} , (2.4.12)\n\nM1? (V ) presents a preferred direction characterized by n and, then, the material is\nsaid to be a transversely isotropic material. Conversely, if the material symmetry\ngroup follows the condition\n\nM2? (V ) =\n{\nQ?O (V ) | Q(nm ? nm)QT = nm ? nm\n\n}\n, (2.4.13)\n\nwhere nm is a unit vector in the direction m, so M2? (V ) preserves the characteristic\nspace of nm ?nm. In other terms, M2? (V ) maintains three mutually orthogonal lines\nin the directions n1, n2, and n3. A body with this symmetry is named an orthotropic\nmaterial.\n\n\u2022 A hemitropic body is a body whose material group is the proper orthogonal group\nO+ (V ) ,\n\nM? (V ) = O+ (V ) .\n\nA body may possess various types of material symmetries for its different properties. For\nexample, an isotropic material with respect to stress and strain may not be isotropic with\n\n15\n\n\n\nrespect to another property e.g. electric polarization and displacement vectors. In addi-\ntion, materials may also be subject to other geometrical and internal constraints, such as\nrubbery materials, which are incompressible. This is expressed in the constitutive equa-\ntions by the additional condition that the local volume remains unchanged.\n\nPRINCIPLE OF LOCALITY\n\nAccording to this principle, the values of the response functional at X are not affected\nappreciably by the values of the independent constitutive variables at distant points from\nX. In other words, the principle of locality implies that the greatest contributions to the\nconstitutive response at a material point are due to its neighborhoods. Mathematically,\nthe principle of locality may be expressed in two different ways: the first way, named the\nhypothesis of smooth neighborhood, describes the spatial dependence of values of ?t\nthrough a Taylor expansion of t about X, and the second one, named the attenuating\nneighborhood hypothesis, describes the spatial dependence of ?t by introducing an in-\nfluence function that evaluates how much the points in a distant neighborhood influence\nthe values of ?t at a specific material point. As the hypothesis of smooth neighborhood\nis much more common in continuum thermodynamics than the attenuating neighborhood\nhypothesis, it is detailed below.\n\nSuppose that the function ?t (Y,t?s) admits Taylor expansions about X = Y for\nall t?s with s ? [0,?),\n\n?t (Y,t?s) =?t (X,t?s) +\n3?\n\ni1=1\n\n(Yi1 ?Xi1 ) ?\n(i1)\nt (X,t?s) + (2.4.14)\n\n1\n\n2!\n\n3?\ni1=1\n\n3?\ni2=1\n\n(Yi1 ?Xi1 ) (Yi2 ?Xi2 ) ?\n(i1i2)\nt (X,t?s) + . . . +\n\n1\n\nm!\n\n3?\ni1=1\n\n. . .\n\n3?\nim=1\n\n(Yi1 ?Xi1 ) . . . (Yim ?Xim ) ?\n(i1...im)\nt (X,t?s) + . . . ,\n\nwhere ?(i1...im)t (X,t?s) is the m-th order partial derivative of ?t relative to the vector com-\nponents Yi1, . . . ,Yim evaluated on X at time t ? s. If the material point Y is confined in a\nsmall enough neighborhood of X, ?t (Y,t?s) can be approximated by truncating Equation\n(2.4.14) at its first-order directional derivative on X in the direction of Y , viz.\n\n?t (Y,t?s) ? ?t (X,t?s) +\n3?\n\ni1=1\n\n(Yi1 ?Xi1 ) ?\n(i1)\nt (X,t?s) . (2.4.15)\n\n16\n\n\n\nIn this case, one says that the material at X for all t?s satisfies the smooth neighborhood\nhypothesis.\n\nIn general, it suffices to assume that the response functional depends only on the\nhistory of ? and its first-order gradient. Thus, Equation (2.4.1) becomes\n\nC (X,t) = R\n(\n?t (X,t?s) ,?\n\n(i1)\nt (X,t?s) ,X\n\n)\n(i1 = 1, 2, 3) . (2.4.16)\n\nOf course, for non-local materials, where the effect of long-range intermolecular forces\ncannot be negligible, Equation (2.4.16) does not hold. In this case, one should introduce\nhigher-order gradients of ?t. Theories in which the principle of locality is not obeyed are\nreferred to as non-local continuum theories.\n\nPRINCIPLE OF MEMORY\n\nThis principle is considered the counterpart of the principle of locality in the time domain.\nFor some materials, physical processes that affected them in a distant past are mostly\nerased. In other words, these materials possess weak memory, so that the constitutive\nvariables at a distant past do not appreciably affect the values of the response functional\nat present.\n\nIn practical terms, it is extremely rare that a material can remember its whole\nhistory whereby was affected since its memory is bounded. Then, instead of using t ? s\nwith s ? [0,?) as an argument of ?t, one can proceed analogously to the principle of\nlocality and use a Taylor series to write ?t (Y,t?s) as\n\n?t (Y,t?s) =?t (Y,t) ?s?\n(1)\nt (Y,t) +\n\n1\n\n2!\ns2?\n\n(2)\nt (Y,t)? (2.4.17)\n\n1\n\n3!\ns3?\n\n(3)\nt (Y,t) + . . . +\n\n1\n\nm!\n(?s)m ?(m)t (Y,t) + . . . ,\n\nwhere ?(m)t (Y,t) denotes the m-th partial time derivative of ?t evaluated at point Y and\ntime t. The use of a Taylor series to express the memory effect of a material body is\nknown as the hypothesis of smooth memory. If the constitutive functionals are sufficiently\nsmooth, so that the dependence on ?t (Y,t?s) can be replaced by\n\n?t (Y,t?s) ? ?t (Y,t) ?s?\n(1)\nt (Y,t) +\n\n1\n\n2!\ns2?\n\n(2)\nt (Y,t) ? . . . +\n\n1\n\nm!\n(?s)m ?(m)t (Y,t) , (2.4.18)\n\none says that the material presents smooth memory, and Equation (2.4.1) becomes\n\n17\n\n\n\nC (X,t) = R\n(\n? (Y,t) ,?\n\n(1)\nt (Y,t) , ...,?\n\n(m)\nt (Y,t) ,X\n\n)\n. (2.4.19)\n\nIn this case, the material is called a rate dependent material of degree m with respect to\nthe variable ?, so that the far past histories of any physical quantity at Y do not affect the\nmaterial behavior at X for time t.\n\nFrequently, materials may not present so a smooth memory as to admit a Taylor\nexpansion of the form (2.4.17). Then, analogously to the attenuating neighborhood hy-\npothesis, one needs to introduce an influence function which takes into account the time\ndependence of the functionals in the far past. Such materials are said to present a fading\nmemory.\n\nPRINCIPLE OF ADMISSIBILITY\n\nThis principle states that constitutive equations must be consistent with the second law of\nthermodynamics. In fact, since the second law of thermodynamics must be not violated for\nall realizable physical processes, one finds that the thermodynamic admissibility imposed\nby the entropy inequality severely restricts the form of constitutive equations.\n\nIn practical terms, the principle of admissibility helps to eliminate the dependence\non certain constitutive variables. One can reduce the generality of the constitutive rela-\ntions relying upon either different formulations of the entropy principle or even variational\nmethods. For example, in reference [24] the principle of virtual work is employed to deduce\nthe proper constitutive equations for an elastic dielectric medium under equilibrium con-\nditions. In turn, in references [61, 62] Sieniutycz proposed a variational approach based\non Onsager\u2019s principle for an electrochemical system under a non-stationary quasi-linear\nregime. Even though, despite the impressive results obtained in these works, application\nof variational methods is not well-posed for non-isolated systems under the influence of\nexternal forces and also for systems where there exists the possibility of several coupling\nphenomena, such as in chemical systems [60]. As a matter of fact, it seems that reacting\nchemical systems do not obey the same phenomenological formalism of non-chemical\nones. In electrochemical systems, for instance, coupling between chemical reactions and\nnon-chemical processes are very common, and one should certainly take them into ac-\ncount. This is a critical point in the development of a constitutive theory for a reacting ionic\nmixture, which requires a more comprehensive approach. Under these circumstances, the\nuse of entropy principles, in particular the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle, is more convenient\nto restrict the material equations of electrolyte solutions.\n\n18\n\n\n\n2.5 Second law of thermodynamics\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics or entropy principle has been one of the main dis-\ncussion topics in Thermodynamics. Since the publication of Carnot and Clausius\u2019 works\n[8, 9, 10, 11], different enunciates for the entropy principle have been proposed, with most\nof them based on the physical notion of temperature [28].\n\nFollowing the thermodynamics of homogeneous processes approach [56, 57], the\nsecond law of thermodynamics is formally expressed as:\n\nIf at a certain instant, a system absorbs heat Q in a thermically homogeneous\nway, at that instant, its entropy S will increase at a rate at least equal to the ratio between\nthe thermal power absorbed and the empirical temperature ? ? R+. Conversely, if at a\nmoment the entropy S of the system is decreasing in a thermally homogeneous way, at\nthat moment heat Q will be liberated and the ratio between the modulus of the thermal\npower emitted, and the empirical temperature is at least equal to the rate of the entropy S\ndecrease, viz.\n\ndQ\n\ndt\n? ?\n\ndS\n\ndt\n.\n\nThe statement above is known as the Clausius-Planck inequality and it was pro-\nposed by Planck [54] from his observations about Clausius\u2019 work. Clearly, the extension\nof this principle to a continuous body B is not straightforward as the temperature, heat,\nand entropy depend not only on time, but also on the point x. In addition, a deeper in-\nsight into the Clausius-Planck inequality indicates that this assumption has serious short-\ncomings since it cannot explain many phenomena occurring inside the system [67]. For\nthis reason, one needs a more general formulation of the entropy principle, such as the\nClausius-Duhem inequality.\n\nThe origins of the Clausius-Duhem inequality go back to the works of Eckart [21,\n22] and Meixner [39] who were responsible for the development of the first consistent\nnon-equilibrium theory. In non-equilibrium thermodynamics, the so-called entropy balance\nequation\n\n?? = ?\nd?\n\ndt\n+ div (?) ??? ? 0 (2.5.1)\n\nplays a central role as it relates the entropy production density, ?, to various irreversible\nprocesses that occur in a system through macroscopic balance laws. In this equation, ? is\nthe entropy density, ? is the entropy flux vector, and ? is the entropy supply density. More-\nover, from Equation (2.3.3), one may also write the entropy jump condition at a singular\nsurface as\n\n19\n\n\n\nJ?? (v \u00b7 n ?un)K ? J?K \u00b7 n ? 0 . (2.5.2)\n\nWithin the theoretical framework of thermodynamics of irreversible processes [17],\nthe entropy production density may be calculated if one makes use of the Gibbs\u2019 relation\nthat connects, for instance, the rates of change of entropy in each regular point to the rates\nof change of energy and composition in an isotropic multi-component fluid. Complying\nwith this approach, ? is given by the ratio between the heat flux vector h and the empirical\ntemperature ?, whereas ? is given by the ratio between the energy supply density r and ?,\n\n?? = ?\nd?\n\ndt\n+ div\n\n(\nh\n\n?\n\n)\n??\n\nr\n\n?\n? 0 . (2.5.3)\n\nInequality (2.5.3) is frequently called of Clausius-Duhem inequality because it represents\nDuhem\u2019s extrapolation for the Clausius\u2019s formulation of the second law for non-homogeneous\ntemperature fields.\n\nFor a long period, the inequality (2.5.3), whose exploitation method is based on the\nworks of Coleman and Noll [13, 67, 68], was extensively used in the development of mod-\nern continuum thermodynamics to impose thermodynamic restrictions on the constitutive\nresponses of a material body. For simple materials, that is, material bodies whose values\nof the constitutive quantities at x depend only on the histories of the deformation gradient,\nand temperature and its gradient, linear irreversible thermodynamics and modern contin-\nuum thermodynamics with the Clausius-Duhem inequality lead to the same practical re-\nsults. This is the reason why linear irreversible thermodynamics and the Clausius-Duhem\ninequality are still widely employed. Nevertheless, with the development of continuum the-\nories for mixtures, porous media, and other non-simple material bodies, it was realized\nthat the two main constitutive assumptions adopted by Coleman and Noll,\n\n? =\nh\n\n?\n, ? =\n\nr\n\n?\n,\n\nare not very satisfactory [73]. Moreover, large deviations from linear behavior are observed\nfor chemical reactions, restricting the application of linear irreversible thermodynamics\nto reacting systems. Since then, other formulations to the entropy principle have been\nproposed, among which the one most employed was proposed by Mu?ller [44, 47].\n\nAccording to Mu?ller\u2019s proposition, the behavior of a continuum body must obey\nthe general entropy balance stated in (2.5.1), where ? and ? are not a priori given con-\nstitutive quantities, such as in the Coleman-Noll exploitation method, but rather consti-\ntutive functions on which thermodynamic restrictions must be placed. Even though this\napproach of the entropy principle is less restrictive than that proposed by Coleman and\n\n20\n\n\n\nNoll, its practical application was still very laborious, even for simple and free of external\nsupplies bodies. Then, Liu [33] suggested to incorporate new auxiliary quantities, termed\nof Lagrange multipliers, in the entropy inequality in order to take into account all balance\nequations in the exploitation of the entropy inequality. Thanks to its comprehensive scope,\nnowadays the Mu?ller-Liu approach to the entropy principle is widely employed to deduce\nrestrictions on constitutive equations and thermodynamically consistent constitutive laws\nin many research fields. Some examples can be found in references [29, 75].\n\n2.6 Quasistatic approximation of electromagnetism\n\nIn addition to the basic laws of motion, electrically polarizable material bodies must obey\nMaxwell\u2019s laws of electromagnetism. However, while the former are Galilean invariant, i.e.,\nthe dynamic laws have the same expressions in any frame related to an inertial frame by a\nGalilean transformation, the latter are invariant with relation to the Lorentz transformation.\nConsequently, in order to obtain a coherent theory for charged/magnetized continuum\nbodies, it is necessary to propose either a relativistic formulation for the laws of dynamics\nor employ an approximation in which both the basic laws of motion and Maxwell\u2019s laws are\nform-invariant in relation to the same transformation.\n\nWith a quasistatic approximation, temporal change rates of electromagnetic quan-\ntities are so small that only low acoustic frequencies and non-relativistic velocities are\nconsidered [40, 41]. In this case, Maxwell\u2019s equations are form-invariant with respect to\nGalilean transformations, and they are given by\n\nFARADAY\u2019S LAW\n\ncurl (E) = 0 , (2.6.1)\n\nAMPE?RE\u2019S LAW\n\ncurl (H) = I +\n?D\n\n?t\n+ curl (P \u00d7 v) , (2.6.2)\n\nGAUSS\u2019S LAW\n\ndiv (D) = q , (2.6.3)\n\n21\n\n\n\nMAGNETIC FLUX LAW\n\ndiv (B) = 0 , (2.6.4)\n\nwhere E is the electric field, H is the magnetic field, I is the electric current, D is the\nelectric displacement vector, P is the electric polarization vector, q is the charge density,\nand B is the magnetic flux vector. Following Chu\u2019s formulation [26] of electromagnetism,\nthe electric field and the magnetic field are regarded as fundamental quantities, whereas\nD and B are auxiliary quantities. These quantities are interrelated by\n\nD = ?oE + P , B = \u00b5o(H + M) , (2.6.5)\n\nwhere ?o and \u00b5o are respectively the permittivity and the permeability of free space, and\nM is the magnetization field.\n\nEquations (2.6.1)\u2013(2.6.4) are analogous to Maxwell\u2019s laws of electrostatics, but\nby no means do the above equations result in a static model. In fact, the temporal de-\npendence of quasi-electrostatic fields can be regarded as a secondary effect because\nonce given the sources of electromagnetic fields at a particular instant, the fields at that\nsame instant are determined without knowing what their sources were in earlier times.\nTherefore, the mathematical problem of finding a quasistatic electric field for a charge dis-\ntribution dependent on time is equivalent to the evaluation of a succession of static fields,\neach one with a different charge distribution at various instants t.\n\nFurthermore, according to the quasi-electrostatic approximation, E is an irrota-\ntional field, and dynamic currents are so small that the magnetic induction is ignorable.\nThus, from Equation (2.6.3), if the charge density is given, both the curl and divergence of\nthe electric field are specified.\n\n2.7 Theory of continuum mixtures\n\nThe first systematic study of non-equilibrium behavior of continuum mixtures was given\nby Truesdell [66, 67] in 1957, and later was extended by Kelly [31] by incorporating elec-\ntromagnetic fields. According to Truesdell\u2019s view, a continuum mixture is formed by su-\nperposing constituents, so that each spatial point is simultaneously occupied by particles\nof all constituents. Incidentally, particles in continuum theories do not represent atoms,\nmolecules, ions or other classical particles, which can be easily labeled, but rather math-\nematical points endowed with physical properties, such as mass density, velocity, electric\n\n22\n\n\n\nfield, internal energy density etc. Then, in admitting this hypothesis, only mixtures whose\nconstituents are not macroscopically distinguishable can be accounted for. Examples of\nsuch mixtures, usually termed classical continuum mixtures, are gas and aqueous solu-\ntions and other monophasic systems consisting of two or more chemical species.\n\nA further hypothesis assumed by Truesdell refers to the individual character of\neach constituent. Accordingly, each constituent behaves as a single fluid and by analogy\none may assign balance laws for the constituents with single pure materials. Here, the\nonly difference that appears between these balance laws, and those for single fluids is\nthe fact that the balance laws of mass, linear and angular momenta, and energy are not\nconserved, but only their sums as a whole are formally the same as for a single mate-\nrial. Hence, it is taken for granted that the motion of a mixture is governed by the same\nequations as for a single body. In other words, by this principle, properties of constituents\nare taken as primitives and the properties and balances of the mixture are formulated with\nbasis in the characteristics of pure chemical substances.\n\nThere is indeed another kind of continuum mixtures, where constituent particles\nare macroscopically identifiable. This kind of mixture, often referred to as multicomponent\nmixtures, does not obey all the assumptions made above since constituents are intimately\nintermixed only at the microscopic level. For example, soils, porous rock, suspensions of\ncoal particles in water, packed powders, granular propellants etc. consist of macroscopic\nidentifiable solid particles surrounded by one or more continuous media or an identifiable\nporous matrix through the continua are dispersed. In this work, multicomponent mixtures\nwill not be considered.\n\n23\n\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n3 Dynamics of Electrochemical\nSystems\n\nA number of the fundamental laws of continuum mechanics are expressions of the con-\nservation of some physical quantity. These balance laws are applicable to all continua and\nresult in equations, either in their integral or local forms, that must always be satisfied. On\nthe other hand, phenomenological aspects of material bodies are brought through consti-\ntutive equations that, unlike balance laws, are specific for each body because they reflect\nthe internal constitution of a material. However, it is impossible to write down one consti-\ntutive equation, which is capable of representing a given material over its entire range of\napplication since many materials behave quite differently under changing levels of load-\ning. Then, perhaps it is better to think of constitutive equations as being representative of\na particular behavior rather than of a particular material. In fact, the usefulness of the con-\nstitutive equations is to describe the relationships among the kinematic, mechanical, and\nthermal field equations and to permit the formulation of well-posed problems in continuum\nthermodynamics. This will be the subject in the next two chapters.\n\nHereafter, the motion of the mixture and its constituents are given with relation\nto an orthonormal frame of reference, and all quantities are given in terms of the current\nconfiguration, that is, physical properties are expressed in terms of the spatial coordinates\nx and time t. Moreover, 1 denotes the unit tensor, ?ij is the Kronecker delta, and brackets\nand parentheses are used to represent the antisymmetry and the symmetry of second-\norder tensors, respectively.\n\n3.1 Kinematics of electrolyte solutions\n\nLet B be a mixture of n constituents Ba, such that a particle of Ba is represented by Xa\nwith a = 1, . . . ,n, being the index n reserved for solvent. In addition, let a region of\nthe Euclidean space E in the current configuration be simultaneously occupied by different\nconstituent particles. Thus, if Xa is the material coordinate in some reference configuration\n\n25\n\n\n\n?, the motion x = xa(Xa, t) of a constituent a is a smooth function of space and time, which\nrelates a particle Xa to a place Xa at the time t in the reference configuration ?.\n\nEach constituent has its own kinematics. The velocity and acceleration of the\nconstituent a at time t are, respectively,\n\nva ?\n?xa(Xa, t)\n\n?t\n, aa ?\n\n?2xa(Xa, t)\n\n?t2\n. (3.1.1)\n\nLikewise, each Ba has its own mass and, consequently, its positive mass density ?a (x, t)\nat each point x and time t. The mass density of the whole mixture ? (x, t) is related to\n?a (x, t) by\n\n? ?\nn?\na=1\n\n?a . (3.1.2)\n\nAt every (x, t), one also defines the mass concentration of Ba as\n\n?a ?\n?a\n?\n, (3.1.3)\n\nwhence Equations (3.1.2) and (3.1.3) imply\nn?\na=1\n\n?a = 1.\n\nThe mean velocity of B is defined by\n\n?v ?\nn?\na=1\n\n?ava , (3.1.4)\n\nand the translational diffusion velocity of Ba is\n\nua = va ? v . (3.1.5)\n\nThus, it follows from Equations (3.1.2), (3.1.4), and (3.1.5) that\nn?\na=1\n\n?aua = 0.\n\nUntil now, the kinematics of reacting ionic mixtures obeys the general framework\nof classical mixtures set up by Truesdell [67]. However, in contrast with the classical\ntheories of mixtures, it has long been accepted that the dynamics of electrolyte solutions\ndepends on the short-range and long-range interactions among the constituent particles\n[76]. Following Eringen and Toupin\u2019s ideas [19, 23, 24, 63, 64, 65], the interactions among\nthe constituent particles are accounted for by considering the electrolyte solution as a\npolar elastic dielectric medium. Then, under an applied electric field, which may be due to\nan external source and/or generated by dissociated ions in solution, constituent particles\nwill interact with the electric field, producing extrinsic body couples and extrinsic surface\n\n26\n\n\n\ncouples. Consequently, to describe accurately the material behavior of such solutions,\nit is necessary to use the theoretical framework of polar theories, where the action of\nextrinsic body couples and surface body couples caused by electromagnetic fields on the\nconstituent particles is properly considered.\n\nThus, polar theories encompass not only the short-range interactions among the\nconstituent particles as do the classical local ones, but also the long-range interaction\nforces. In this sense, electrolyte solutions differ from the classical mixtures because the\nbehavior of their material points is influenced by all points of the solution independently\nof ions concentrations. Then, in order to include the microscopic structure of electrolyte\nsolutions into the continuum model, new kinematic variables are associated to each point\n(x, t) of the mixture [58].\n\nIn constrast with the local theories, where the only kinematic vector field is the\nvelocity v(x, t), polar materials present two independent kinematic vector fields to describe\nthe translational and rotational motions of the fluid particles. If the mechanics of rigid\nbodies is assumed, each constituent particle possesses a spin field sa(x, t) and a local\nangular velocity ?a(x, t), which are interrelated by\n\nsa ? Ia?a , (3.1.6)\n\nwhere Ia is the inertia momentum tensor.\nIn polar media, the angular velocity of the particle does not coincide with the\n\nangular velocity of the mixture, viz., vorticity w. The angular velocity of a particle in relation\nto the fluid vorticity is given by\n\n$a ? ?a ? w , (3.1.7)\n\nwhere $a represents the angular velocity of the constituent particle relative to the angular\nvelocity of the region in which it is embedded. Clearly, all definitions extend to the mixture\nparticle, so one may equally assign to the mixture particles a spin field s, an angular\nvelocity ?, and an inertia tensor I, which are related to those of the constituents by\n\n?s ?\nn?\na=1\n\n?asa , ?? ?\nn?\na=1\n\n?a?a , ?I ?\nn?\na=1\n\n?aIa . (3.1.8)\n\nLikewise the translational motion, one also defines a rotational diffusion velocity\nof the constituent a as\n\n?a ? ?a ?? , (3.1.9)\n\n27\n\n\n\nsuch that\nn?\na=1\n\n?a?a = 0.\n\n3.2 Balance laws for continuum mixtures and their\n\nconstituents\n\nIt is the main purpose of Electrochemistry to investigate the properties of ionic conductors\nand of electric circuits containing ionic conductors, as well as the phenomena that occur\nduring the passage of an electric current through such circuits. These phenomena include\nchemical reactions, structural deformations, mass transport, dissipation of energy to name\nonly a few. Then, modeling the behavior of electrochemical systems in its simplest form\ndemands the coupling of balance equations of continuum mixture theory and Maxwell\u00b4s\nequations. Coupling these equations, one can describe the essential phenomena which\noccur in electrochemical systems. However, since interactions among the constituent\nparticles play an important role in the physico-chemical behavior of these systems, one\nshould use the conceptual basis of the thermodynamics of polar continua to represent\nthese interactions.\n\nIn order to derive the local balance equations, one starts from the general balance\nlaw for the constituents of the mixture,\n\n??a\n?t\n\n+ div (?a ? va ? ??a) ??\n?\na ??\n\n?\na = 0 , (3.2.1)\n\nwhich holds at all points of the body except on the singular surfaces. Once defined Equa-\ntion (3.2.1), one relates each variable in Equation (3.2.1) to the physical quantities which\nmust be present in the mass, linear and angular momenta, energy, and entropy balance\nequations. The identifications of the variables for each balance are given in Table 2.1,\nwhere ?a is the internal energy density, ?a is the entropy density, ta is the total stress vec-\ntor related to the total stress tensor Ta by ta (x, n, t) = Ta (x, t) n, Ca is the total coupling\nstress tensor, ha is the heat flux, ?a is the entropy flux let as an unspecified quantity, ba is\nthe mechanical body force density, qa is the charge density defined by ?aza, being za the\ncharge per unit mass, Ea and Pa are the electric field and the electric polarization field\nacting on the constituent a, respectively, la is the mechanical coupling body force density,\nra is the mechanical energy supply density, ia is the electric current density due to the\ndiffusive motion, ?a is the entropy supply density let as an unspecified quantity, ca, ma, ?a,\n?a and ?a are the mass , linear and angular momenta, energy and entropy productions,\nand oo is the position vector of an arbitrary fixed point.\n\n28\n\n\n\n3.2.1 Mass balance\n\nAnalogously to a single constituent body, flux and supply vanish in the mass balance of\nBa. Nonetheless, as constituents can take part in chemical reactions, a term of mass\nproduction, ca, should be accounted for. For a regular point x, the mass balance for the\na-th constituent of the mixture is\n\n??a\n?t\n\n+ div (?ava) ? ca = 0 , (3.2.2)\n\nwhere the mass production term is related to the velocities of mass conversion, caj and\ncja, by [7]\n\nca =\nn?\nj=1\n\n(cja ? caj) . (3.2.3)\n\nIf the constituent a is converted into the constituent j at a spatial point x, but the species j\nis not converted into the constituent a, then caj > 0 and cja = 0. Inversely, if the constituent\nj is converted into the species a and the latter is not converted into the former, then cja > 0\nand caj = 0. However, since in chemical systems, chemical reactions can proceed in both\ndirections, caj and cja can be simultaneously positive at x. Thus, while caj and cja are\nnon-negative quantities because they correspond to the forward and inverse chemical\nreactions velocities, respectively, ca may be positive, negative or null.\n\nThe introduction of terms relative to the mass conversion rate of a constituent\na into a constituent j is fundamental to associate the nature of electrolytes to ion-ion\ninteractions, which determine the properties of electrolyte solutions. The degree with\nwhich these interactions affect the properties of the solution depends on the density of the\ndistribution of ions in solution that, in turn, depends on the nature of the electrolyte, i.e., it\ndepends on the electrolyte to be a real or potential one.\n\nPotential electrolytes are those, which through chemical reactions with the solvent\nmolecules, dissociate into ions. Many of the solutions of potential electrolytes contain only\na small concentration of ions and, therefore, the effects of ion-ion interactions are often\noverlooked. The behavior of these solutions is predominantly governed by the equilibrium\nposition of the reaction between the potential electrolyte and the solvent molecules. Thus,\ncaj and cja are different for the same point of the mixture until the kinetic equilibrium is\nreached.\n\nIn contrast, real electrolytes originate ions in solution through physical interactions\nbetween ions in the ionic solid and solvent molecules. Usually, real electrolytes are com-\npletely dissolved in water, so that the resulting solution consists of solvent and solvated\n\n29\n\n\n\nions only. For these solutions, the dependence of their properties on concentration is\ndetermined by the strength of the ionic interactions.\n\nThe classification of real and potential electrolytes is a modern one [3] that aims\nto describe the behavior of electrolytes through their structures and not through their be-\nhaviors at some particular solvent. Historically, however, the classification was proposed\nwith basis in a specific solvent, generally water. Weak electrolytes were then those which\nproduced solutions with low electrical conductivity when dissolved in water, while strong\nelectrolytes were those which originated high electric-conducting aqueous solutions. The\ndisadvantage of the older classification consists in the fact of that as soon as a different\nsolvent is chosen, a strong electrolyte in water can behave as a weak electrolyte in a\nnon-aqueous solvent and vice-versa.\n\nThe mass balance for the mixture is obtained by considering null the sum of mass\n\nproduction terms over all constituents that take part in reaction,\nn?\nj=1\n\nn?\na=1\n\n(cja ? caj) = 0.\n\nConsequently, the last equality imposes that chemical reactions do not change the mass\ndensity of the mixture at every spatial point and time. Hence, from Equations (3.1.2) and\n(3.2.2), there remains\n\n??\n\n?t\n+ div (?v) = 0 , (3.2.4)\n\nor yet\n\nd?\n\ndt\n+ ?div (v) = 0 , (3.2.5)\n\nwhere the material time derivative following the motion of the mixture, d (\u00b7) /dt = ? (\u00b7) /?t+\nv \u00b7?(\u00b7), was used.\n\nSimilarly, one may also employ the material time derivative following the motion\nof the mixture to simplify Equation (3.2.2). In this case, one recalls Equation (3.1.3), and\nthen Equation (3.2.2) takes the form\n\n?\n??a\n?t\n\n+ ?a\n??\n\n?t\n+ div (??ava) ? ca = 0 . (3.2.6)\n\nThus, with help of the vector identity div (fu) = ?f \u00b7(u) + fdiv (u) and Equation (3.2.5), it\nfollows that\n\n?\nd?a\ndt\n\n+ div (ja) ? ca = 0 , (3.2.7)\n\nwhere ja ? ?a (va ? v) is the diffusive flux of the constituent a.\n\n30\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Linear momentum balance\n\nIn electrochemical systems, the movement of ions is responsible for the electric-conducting\nproperties exhibited by the electrolyte solution. This phenomenon implies the existence\nof some force whose character is not exclusively electrostatic since ions experience me-\nchanical and chemical forces. If the total electric field is called the effective electric field\nEef , then Eef will not necessarily be a solenoidal vector field [59]. In fact, for an electric-\nconducting medium, one has div\n\n(\nEef\n)\n\n= femf , where femf is the electromotive force and\nit represents the ratio between the energy applied by a power supply and the charge car-\nried by a particle in an electric circuit [30]. For electrochemical cells, the electromotive\nforce is the electric potential difference between the electrodes when the current through\nthe cell is null (zero current potential).\n\nIf all forces acting on an electric-conducting body, with exception of the Lorentz\nforce, FL = q (E + v \u00d7 B), which represents the total electromagnetic force on a charged\nspecies, are combined into a single term, FW , one has\n\nqEef =q (E + v \u00d7 B) + FW (3.2.8)\n\n=qE + I \u00d7 B + FW ,\n\nwhere the definition of electric current, I =\nn?\na=1\n\n?azava, was used. 1 Besides, for any system\n\nconsidered under the quasi-electrostatic approximation [40], qE ? I \u00d7 B and, therefore,\nthe magnetic contribution to the Lorentz force can be neglected. Thus, it follows that the\neffective electric field is given only by qEef = qE + FW .\n\n1 The electric current density I can be written as follows,\n\nI =\n\nn?\na=1\n\n?azava\n\n=\n\nn?\na=1\n\n?azav +\n\nn?\na=1\n\nzaja ,\n\nwhere the definition of diffusive flux has been used. The second term of the right-hand side of the ex-\npression above is the electric current due to the relative motion of the various components. Defining\n\ni =\n\nn?\na=1\n\nzaja and ia = zaja, the expression for I becomes\n\nI =\n\nn?\na=1\n\n?azav + i .\n\n31\n\n\n\nEvidently, the ion-ion interactions are different from ion-solvent interactions. If the\ncharge carrier constituents were the only ones responsible for the forces that perchance\nexist in a mixture, it would not be possible to explain the real behavior of electrolyte so-\nlutions. While coulombic forces are responsible for the ion-ion interactions, the Kelvin\npolarization force, P \u00b7 (?E), is the result of the action of the electric field on the dipoles of\nwater molecules that make up the solvent. In addition, because the medium is continuous,\none can assume a continuous distribution of dipoles given by\n\n? = ?div (P) . (3.2.9)\n\nHence, on the basis of the quantities given in Table 2.1, the linear momentum\nbalance equations for the a-th constituent of the mixture and for the mixture as a whole\nare, respectively,\n\n??ava\n?t\n\n+ div (?ava ? va ?Ta) ??aba ? qaEa ? Pa \u00b7 (?Ea) ? ma = 0 , (3.2.10)\n\n??v\n\n?t\n+ div (?v ? v ?T ) ??b ? qE ? P \u00b7 (?E) = 0 , (3.2.11)\n\nor\n\n?\ndv\n\ndt\n? div (T ) ??b ? qE ? P \u00b7 (?E) = 0 , (3.2.12)\n\nwhere ?b =\nn?\na=1\n\n?aba, qE =\nn?\na=1\n\nqaEa, P =\nn?\na=1\n\nPa,\nn?\na=1\n\nma = 0, such that ma represents\n\nthe force per unit volume exerted by all other chemical species of the mixture on the con-\nstituent a, and the total stress tensor should be interpreted as the sum of the mechanical\nand electromagnetic stress tensors.\n\nMoreover,\nn?\na=1\n\n(?ava ? va ?Ta) =\nn?\na=1\n\n(?ava ? va) ?\nn?\na=1\n\nTa, which with the use of\n\nEquation (3.1.5), becomes\nn?\na=1\n\n(?ava ? va ?Ta) =\nn?\na=1\n\n(?ava ? v)+\nn?\na=1\n\n(?ava ? ua)?\nn?\na=1\n\nTa.\n\nThus, since ?v =\nn?\na=1\n\n?ava and T I =\nn?\na=1\n\nTa, it follows that\nn?\na=1\n\n(?ava ? va ?Ta) = ?v ? v ?\n\nT I +\nn?\na=1\n\n(?ava ? ua), whence one concludes that the total stress tensor of the mixture is\n\n32\n\n\n\ngiven by T = T I ?\nn?\na=1\n\n(?ava ? ua), being T I the constitutive part of the stress tensor of\n\nthe mixture.\nEquation (3.2.12) also offers the opportunity of introducing an important tensor\n\nof electrodynamics theory. For this purpose, all mechanical contributions of Equation\n(3.2.12) are neglected. In addition, the velocity is supposed to be constant, so that its time\nderivative is zero. Thus, from Equation (3.2.12), there remains\n\n?div (T ) = qE + P \u00b7 (?E) . (3.2.13)\n\nBesides, writing down the coulombic force as qE = Ediv (D), Equation (3.2.13) becomes\n\n?div (T ) = Ediv (D) + P \u00b7 (?E) . (3.2.14)\n\nThis expression may be further simplified by making use of the vector identities div (u ? y) =\n?u (y) + udiv (y), 1/2?(u \u00b7 y) = y \u00d7 rot (u) + ?u (y), ?(u \u00b7 y) = div [(u \u00b7 y) 1 ], Equation\n(2.6.5)1, and recalling that, according to the quasi-electrostatic approximation, the electric\nfield is irrotational. Hence,\n\ndiv (T ) = div\n\n(\n1\n\n2\n?oE\n\n21 ? P ? E ? E ? E\n)\n, (3.2.15)\n\nwhence one obtains that the electromagnetic contribution for the total stress tensor is\ngiven by P?E + E?E?1/2?oE21 , being the non-symmetric part given by Tij = PiEj, and\nthe symmetric part, also known as Maxwell stress tensor, given by T(ij) = EiEj?1/2?oE2?ij.\n\n3.2.3 Angular momentum balance\n\nSince the electrolyte is composed of continuous polar bodies in each point of the mixture,\nthe angular momentum of each constituent is given by the sum of two parts: the angular\nmomentum at the center of mass with respect to an arbitrary fixed point, oo\u00d7?ava, and the\nangular momentum of the constituent relative to its center of mass (spin), ?asa. Similarly,\nthe supply of angular momentum is the sum of the electromagnetic coupling, Pa \u00d7Ea, the\ncoupling of mechanical forces, ?ala, and the angular momentum with respect to an arbi-\ntrary fixed point of the forces acting on the center of mass, oo\u00d7[?aba + qaEa + Pa \u00b7 (?Ea)].\nIn turn, the flux of angular momentum is given by the coupling stress tensor, Ca, and the\ncross product between the position vector and the total stress tensor, oo \u00d7Ta. 2 Finally,\n\n2 See Appendix II for more information about properties of skew-symmetric tensors.\n\n33\n\n\n\nthe production of angular momentum, ?a, is given by the spin production and the angular\nmomentum production at the mass center.\n\nThen, having defined these quantities, the angular momentum balance equations\nfor the a-th constituent and for the whole mixture are, respectively,\n\n? (oo \u00d7?ava + ?asa)\n?t\n\n+ div [(oo \u00d7?ava + ?asa) ? va ?Ca ? oo \u00d7Ta]? (3.2.16)\n\noo \u00d7 [?aba + qaEa + Pa \u00b7 (?Ea)] ? Pa \u00d7 Ea ??ala ??a = 0 ,\n\n? (oo \u00d7?v + ?s)\n?t\n\n+ div [(oo \u00d7?v + ?s) ? v ?C ? oo \u00d7T ]? (3.2.17)\n\noo \u00d7 [?b + qE + P \u00b7 (?E)] ? P \u00d7 E ??l = 0 ,\n\nwhere C =\nn?\na=1\n\nCa ?\nn?\na=1\n\n(?asa ? ua), such that the first term of the right-hand side corre-\n\nsponds to the constitutive part of the coupling stress tensor and\nn?\na=1\n\n?a = 0.\n\nEquation (3.2.17) may be further simplified to give the balance of spin. Then,\nwith the definition of the material time derivative following the motion of the mixture, and\ndiv (oo \u00d7T ) = oo \u00d7 div (T ) + 2t?, one obtains\n\n?\nds\n\ndt\n? div (C) + 2t? ? P \u00d7 E ??l = 0 , (3.2.18)\n\nwhere t? is the dual vector associated to the skew-symmetric part of the stress tensor.\nHence, from Equation (3.2.18), the total stress tensor T will be symmetric only\n\nif simultaneously, the time derivative of spin is zero, C is a solenoidal field, the electric\nfield is strong enough to keep aligned P and E, and mechanical coupling stresses are\nabsent. Consequently, as usual for polar material bodies, the conservation law of angular\nmomentum cannot be mutually obtained from the conservation law of linear momentum\nsince not all torques and forces arise from macroscopic body forces.\n\nThe antisymmetry of the stress tensor has been closely related to the microscopic\nstructure of the mixture, in particular, to the torques that act on the electric dipoles of ions.\nWhen an electric field is imposed on an electrolyte solution, either by an external source\nor due to the presence of dissociated ions in solution, the polarization equilibrium of the\nelectric dipoles of the water molecules is affected. Then, the solvent dipoles are rotated\nby a torque given by P \u00d7 E in order to align them to the electric field. The release of this\n\n34\n\n\n\nprocess to a new position of equilibrium dissipates energy, causing a greater friction on\nthe ion than that expected if the solvent was an unpolarizable viscous fluid. Therefore,\nthe ionic mobility and conductivity of the solution are changed as a result of the effects\nof electrophoresis and relaxation caused, respectively, by the ion-ion interactions and the\nviscous drag force on the ion due to the solvent.\n\n3.2.4 Energy balance\n\nFor polar continua subject to the influence of mechanical and electromagnetic fields, the\ntotal energy density is composed of the kinetic energy of rotation, 1/2?asa\u00b7?a, kinetic energy\nof translation, 1/2?av2a, as well the density of internal energy, ?a?a. Likewise, the heat flux\nvector encompasses contributions from mechanical and electromagnetic sources, with the\nlatter being given by the Poyinting vector, Ea \u00d7 Ha, that represents the directional energy\nflux density of an electromagnetic field. Accordingly, the energy supply and the energy\nproduction are also given by both mechanical and electromagnetic contributions, namely:\n\n\u2022 The rate of electrical work per unit volume, ia \u00b7 Ea;\n\n\u2022 The rate of energy supplied per unit volume due to the polarization process of the\nmedium, P?a \u00b7 Ea;\n\n\u2022 The mechanical power due to the translational motion, va\u00b7[?aba + qaEa + Pa \u00b7 (?Ea)],\nand the rotational motion, ?a \u00b7 (Pa \u00d7 Ea + ?ala);\n\n\u2022 The energy supply, ?ara, due to external sources, such as radiation;\n\n\u2022 The energy production, ?a, which accounts for the production of energy due to chem-\nical reactions, and translational and rotational motions.\n\nThus, the local forms of the energy balances for each constituent of the mixture and for\nthe mixture as a whole are, respectively,\n\n?\n\n[\n?a?a +\n\n1\n\n2\n(?av\n\n2\na + ?asa \u00b7?a)\n\n]\n?t\n\n+ div\n\n{[\n?a?a +\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(\n?av\n\n2\na + ?asa \u00b7?a\n\n)]\nva\n\n}\n+ (3.2.19)\n\ndiv (ha ?Tava ?Ca?a) ? va \u00b7 [?aba + qaEa + Pa \u00b7 (?Ea)]?\n\n?a \u00b7 (Pa \u00d7 Ea + ?ala) ??ara ? ia \u00b7 Ea ?

Thus, mechanical and electromagnetic sources and\nmacroscopic and microscopic structures of the mixture have different effects on r.\n\nEquation (3.2.20) may be written in an alternative form, if the material time deriva-\ntive following the motion of the mixture, and Equations (3.2.5), (3.2.12) and (3.2.18) are\nused. Then, Equation (3.2.20) takes the form\n\n?\nd?\n\ndt\n+ div (h) ?T \u00b7?v ?C \u00b7??? 2? \u00b7 t? ??r ? i \u00b7 E ? P? \u00b7 E = 0 , (3.2.21)\n\nwhich is known as the balance of internal energy of the mixture.\n\n36\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Entropy balance\n\nThe entropy balance reflects the fact that observable thermodynamic processes are irre-\nversible. With this in mind, it is postulated that [49] (i) there exists an additive objective\nscalar quantity, named entropy density, for each constituent and the mixture as one, (ii)\nthe entropy density and the entropy flux are constitutive quantities, and (iii) the entropy\nproduction of the whole mixture is a non-negative quantity for all realizable physical pro-\ncesses. With these assumptions, the entropy balance for each constituent of the mixture\nis given by\n\n??a?a\n?t\n\n+ div (?a?ava + ?a) ??a?a ??a?a = 0 , (3.2.22)\n\nwhereas the entropy balance for the mixture is\n\n?? =\n???\n\n?t\n+ div (??v + ?) ??? ? 0 , (3.2.23)\n\nor yet by Equation (2.5.1),\n\n?? = ?\nd?\n\ndt\n+ div (?) ??? ? 0 ,\n\nwhere ?? =\nn?\na=1\n\n?a?a, ? =\nn?\na=1\n\n(?a ??a?aua), ?? =\nn?\na=1\n\n?a?a, and ?? =\nn?\na=1\n\n?a?a ? 0.\n\nObserve that the entropy production for each constituent, ?a, may take any value, provided\nthe entropy production of the whole mixture, ?, is a non-negative quantity. This assumption\nresults in a weak limitation of the entropy principle that is termed Truesdell\u2019s axiom of\ndissipation [67].\n\n37\n\n\n\nTa\nb\n\nle\n2.\n\n1.\nP\n\nhy\nsi\n\nca\nlq\n\nua\nnt\n\niti\nes\n\nof\na\n\nco\nns\n\ntit\nue\n\nnt\nof\n\nth\ne\n\nm\nix\n\ntu\nre\n\n.\n\nQ\nu\n\nan\nti\n\nty\nM\n\nas\ns\n\nL\nin\n\nea\nr\n\nM\no\n\nm\nen\n\ntu\nm\n\nA\nn\n\ng\nu\n\nla\nr\n\nM\no\n\nm\nen\n\ntu\nm\n\nE\nn\n\ner\ng\n\ny\nE\n\nn\ntr\n\no\np\n\ny\n\n?\na\n\n?\na\n\n?\na\nv\na\n\no\no\n\u00d7\n?\na\nv\na\n+\n?\na\ns\na\n\n?\na\n?\na\n+\n\n1 /\n2\n( ? av\n\n2 a\n+\n?\na\ns\na\n\u00b7?\n\na\n\n)\n?\na\n?\na\n\n?\n? a\n\n0\nT\na\n\no\no\n\u00d7\nT\na\n+\nC\na\n\n?\nh\na\n+\nT\na\nv\na\n+\nC\na\n?\na\n\n?\n?\na\n\n?\n? a\n\n0\n?\na\nb\na\n+\nq a\n\nE\na\n+\n\nP\na\n\u00b7(\n?\n\nE\na\n)\n\no\no\n\u00d7\n[?\na\nb\na\n+\nq a\n\nE\na\n+\n\nP\na\n\u00b7(\n?\n\nE\na\n)]\n+\n\n?\na\nr\na\n+\n\ni a\n\u00b7E\n\na\n+\n\nP?\na\n\u00b7E\n\na\n+\n\n?\na\n?\na\n\nP\na\n\u00d7\n\nE\na\n+\n?\na\nl a\n\nv\na\n\u00b7[\n?\na\nb\na\n+\nq a\n\nE\na\n+\n\nP\na\n\u00b7(\n?\n\nE\na\n)]\n+\n\n?\na\n\u00b7(\n\nP\na\n\u00d7\n\nE\na\n+\n?\na\nl a\n)\n\n?\n? a\n\nc a\nm\na\n\n?\na\n\n? a\n?\na\n\n38\n\n\n\n4 Electrochemical Systems: Interionic\nInteractions\n\nThe balance equations previously shown are fundamental physical laws that are valid for\nall bodies irrespective of their constitution and unalterable within the domain of classical\nmechanics. On the other hand, the responses of different material bodies of same geom-\netry subject to identical loads are, in general, different. To take into account the nature\nof different materials, a set of constitutive equations must be constructed. These equa-\ntions depend on the nature and the range of physical effects desired, and they are based\non certain basic principles and thermodynamic restrictions deduced from the entropy in-\nequality. Together with the balance field equations, constitutive equations form a system of\ndifferential equations whose every solution is a thermodynamic process. These solutions,\nin turn, are particularized through initial and boundary conditions for certain experimental\nconditions. Once this is done, the constitutive theory proposed is ready to be exploited in\nseveral practical applications.\n\n4.1 Interactions among the constituent particles in\n\nelectrolyte solutions\n\nThe dependence of many properties of electrolyte solutions on concentration is deter-\nmined by interionic interactions and ultimately by the mean distance among the ions in\nsolution. A requirement for studying in detail ion-ion and ion-solvent interactions is to\ncompute the chemical potential change due to the interactions of the ionic species a with\nother ions in solution and the solvent. The latter can be determined by considering the\ntransfer of an ion from medium 1 of relative permittivity ?1 to medium 2 of relative per-\nmittivity ?2. If medium 1 is set up as vacuum, the energy required in this process is the\nenergy of solvation and it provides a notion about whether ionic species in solution inter-\nact with the solvent molecules (Born solvation model). Conversely, analysis of interaction\nforces among the ions in solution comes from the calculation of the electrostatic potential\n\n39\n\n\n\nproduced at a reference ion by the rest of ions in solution (Debye-Hu?ckel model). If one\nknows the time-averaged spatial distribution of the ions, one can determine how the other\ncharges are distributed as a function of distance from the reference ion. Hereby, one of\nthe fundamental laws of electrostatics, namely, the law of the superposition of potentials,\nmay be used to set the potential at a point as being the sum of the potentials due to each\nof the charges in the assembly [3, 51].\n\nOf course, as any theoretical model, the ideas above present shortcomings, but\nboth models represented a great advance in the understanding of the behavior of ionic\nmixtures. Particularly, the study of interionic interactions allows to understand the de-\nparture from ideality in electrolyte solutions, which was shown to be mainly due to the\nchanges in the nature of interactions among the particles. As the solution becomes more\nconcentrated, chemical species are closer and long-range as well as short-range interac-\ntions become important. In short, coulombic interactions among ions are not sufficient to\ndescribe the dynamics of concentrated solutions, and other types of interactions must be\nincluded e.g. repulsion among the chemical species, ion-dipole interactions, and dipole-\ndipole interactions.\n\nAs a matter of fact, when the Debye-Hu?ckel model is tested against experimental\nresults, it is very successful in accounting for the behavior at low concentrations. How-\never, at moderate and higher concentrations deviations from ideal behavior become more\napparent because other assumptions made by Debye and Hu?ckel also fail, viz. [25]:\n\n\u2022 Because interionic forces are treated only in terms of short-range coulombic forces,\nthe random motion of ions is neglected;\n\n\u2022 All electrolytes behave as real electrolytes;\n\n\u2022 Ions are considered spherically symmetrical and unpolarisable. This hypothesis is\nnot valid even for simple ions, such as NO?3 (aq) and SO\n\n2?\n4 (aq), which are not spher-\n\nically symmetrical. Other large ions, such as ethylenediaminetetraacetate and many\nof those encountered in bio and geological media, certainly are non-spherically sym-\nmetrical. Likewise, many ions are not unpolarisable and simple ions such as I?(aq)\nare indeed highly polarisable;\n\n\u2022 The solvent is a structureless dielectric, so that its molecular structure is assumed\nnot to interfere in the way ions interact with the solvent;\n\n\u2022 Electrostriction of ions is ignored. But, because of the intense electric fields near the\nions, they may be deformed;\n\n40\n\n\n\n\u2022 Ions are spherically distributed around the central ion. This is a crucial part of the\nDebye-Hu?ckel model, and even though it has been dealt with by statistical mechan-\nical averaging procedures [27], only spherical symmetry has been assumed. Any\ndistribution of ions around a spherically symmetrical central ion does not necessar-\nily need to be spherically symmetrical, but on average, all possible arrangements\nwill correspond to spherical symmetry. Because a charge density corresponds to\nan average distribution of ions, so conversion of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to\nspherical symmetry is purely formal. However, as was stated above, there is one\nimportant limitation to this when considering large ions. Here, the central ion is non-\nspherical and, therefore, a spherically symmetrical distribution of charge around it\nmay not be possible. Briefly, the Debye-Hu?ckel model is applicable only for a spher-\nical central ion.\n\nAn interionic theory under these conditions is obviously limited and other attempts to over-\ncome these constraints are desirable. One way of coping with these limitations is to em-\nploy the continuum thermodynamics approach by coupling elements of polar theory with\nclassical continuum mixture theory. With this approach, one shows that it is possible to\naccount for microscopic interactions with the fluid flow through a skew-symmetric stress\ntensor and body couplings.\n\n4.2 Proposed continuum model\n\nIt is the purpose of this chapter to discuss the dynamics of aqueous electrolyte solutions.\nSuch solutions are assumed to be diluted, so the main fluid (water) is much more dom-\ninant than all other constituents. As a result, the thermodynamics of the mixture can be\ndescribed as that of the main fluid. Under these conditions, one temperature field is re-\nquired and the linear and angular momenta of the mixture coincide with those of solvent.\nConsequently, only the balances of energy and linear and angular momenta for the whole\nmixture are employed.\n\nMoreover, in determining the behavior of electrochemical systems by evaluating\nthe fields ? (x, t), ?a (x, t), v (x, t), $ (x, t), ? (x, t), and E (x, t), one presumes that most of\nthe effects revealed by electrochemical systems are accounted for by the dependence on\nthe mass density and its gradient, concentration and its gradient, velocity and its gradient,\nrelative local angular velocity, gradient of local angular velocity, temperature and its gradi-\nent, and electric field. In other words, the set of the independent constitutive variables y\nis\n\n41\n\n\n\ny ?{?,??,?a,??b, v,?v,$,??,?,??, E} (?a,b = 1, ..,n? 1) . (4.2.1)\n\nNonetheless, as the principle of material objectivity requires that constitutive functions\nmust be independent of the observers, constitutive functions do not depend on the ve-\nlocity, and they depend on the velocity gradient only through its symmetric part, called\nthe stretching tensor, D. Furthermore, $ is also a non-objective quantity, but by using\na linear map (duality map) one can establish a one-to-one correspondence between a\nskew-symmetric objective tensor and a non-objective vector. That is, the dependence of\nthe constitutive functions on $ occurs by a skew-symmetric tensor of type Wij = eijk$k.\n\nOne may also exploit the irrotational nature of the quasistatic electric field and\ndefine it in terms of a scalar function. Recalling the Helmholtz theorem, one writes\n\nE ????, (4.2.2)\n\nwhere ? is the electric potential. In other words, the electric field in quasi-electrostatic\napproximation is completely specified only by its scalar source (Gauss law).\n\nWith these assumptions, (4.2.1) becomes\n\ny ?{?,??,?a,??b,?,??, E,D,W ,??} (?a,b = 1, ..,n? 1) , (4.2.3)\n\nwhere E transforms as an objective quantity in the quasi-electrostatic approximation. In-\ncidentally, constitutive relations must be formulated for\n\nC ? {ja,ca,T ,C, P,?, h, i,?, ?} (?a = 1, ..,n? 1) , (4.2.4)\n\nwhich are dependent on the variables (4.2.3). Through the dependence of (4.2.4) on\n(4.2.3), one proposes a constitutive class capable of describing the chemical changes\ncaused by the passage of electric current, and the transport phenomena caused by elec-\ntrochemical reactions in a viscous fluid. This constitutive class will characterize the ma-\nterial response of a mixture of viscous polar fluids with diffusion, chemical reactions, and\nconduction of heat and electric current.\n\nOnce all relevant constitutive assumptions and balance equations have been es-\ntablished, the entropy principle can be exploited. For a physically realizable process of\nthe mixture investigated, the entropy inequality (2.5.1) must be satisfied subject to the\nsimultaneous satisfaction of the balance laws (2.6.3), (3.2.5), (3.2.7), (3.2.12), (3.2.18),\n\n42\n\n\n\nand (3.2.21). Instead of fulfilling the entropy inequality for independent fields that are con-\nstrained by the balance laws, one employs the method of Lagrange multipliers proposed\nby Liu [33]. According to this approach, the entropy inequality is subtracted from the prod-\nucts of each balance equation with its corresponding Lagrange multiplier, so that it can\nbe satisfied for unrestricted independent fields. For the mixture investigated, the extended\nentropy inequality\n\n? = ?\nd?\n\ndt\n+ div (?) ??? ? ??\n\n(\nd?\n\ndt\n+ ?div (v)\n\n)\n? (4.2.5)\n\n?v \u00b7\n(\n?\ndv\n\ndt\n? div (T ) ? qE ??b ?

(x, t) ,?a (x, t) , v (x, t) ,? (x, t) ,? (x, t) , E (x, t)} of the field equa-\ntions, where ?o is homogeneous. Here, the quantities ??, ?v, ??a , ??, ??, and ?G rep-\nresent the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints placed on the entropy in-\nequality by the balance equations. These Lagrange multipliers may be given by constitu-\ntive relations too.\n\nIn addition to previous constitutive assumptions, some further premises must be\ntaken into account, most of which are plausible. They are:\n\n\u2022 Even though the solvent mass is much bigger than the masses of the other con-\nstituents of the mixture (this hypothesis is feasible up to 1.0 \u00d7 10?1 mol L?1), the\nelectrolyte solution may not behave as an ideal dilute solution. If so, interactions\namong the constituent particles of the mixture have a great influence on the ther-\nmodynamic behavior of the solution and, thus, they must be accounted for. In this\nchapter, such interactions are considered by assembling concepts of polar and con-\ntinuum mixture theories. Consequently, new phenomenological coefficients should\nappear in the constitutive model proposed;\n\n\u2022 For many materials whose constitutive class does not encompass the time derivative\nof temperature, d?/dt, in the set of independent constitutive variables, and the heat\nflux is collinear to the entropy flux, then the Lagrange multiplier of energy is the\n\n43\n\n\n\nreciprocal of the empirical temperature, ?? = 1/?, also referred to as coldness [73].\nThis definition was obtained by Mu?ller [45, 46, 47, 48] by assuming the existence of\na special kind of material singular surface, the so-called ideal surface, across which\nthe entropy jump condition is\n\nJ?K \u00b7 n = J??hK \u00b7 n = 0 ? J?K = 0 . (4.2.6)\n\nWhenever an ideal wall separates two bodies, the jump condition above is the re-\nquirement that the normal component of the entropy flux is continuous. In practical\nterms, Mu?ller took for granted that Equation (4.2.6) is necessary to make the tem-\nperature measurable through a thermometer. Moreover, as a direct consequence of\nthe existence of such ideal surfaces between any material body brought into con-\ntact with a single body, Equation (4.2.6) always will imply that ?? = 1/?. However,\nfor many material classes e.g. granular and porous media and multiphase mixtures\nexhibiting a single temperature, ideal material surfaces do not exist. In reference\n[74], Wilmanski found conditions for which the temperature is continuous across a\nmaterial singular surface in a fluid-solid mixture. The first of these conditions allows\nno entropy production on the singular surface, and the second one requires either\nimpermeability of the surface or continuity of the Gibbs energy across the surface.\nIndeed, for theories with multiple temperatures, this situation is even worse since the\nproblem does not have a solution yet. Hence, in view of these considerations, in this\nwork it is assumed that under sufficiently general conditions, there exists an ideal\nsurface across which the temperature, and the tangential velocity are continuous,\nsuch that the behavior of the electrochemical system is not affected;\n\n\u2022 The definition of ??a can be obtained by taking into account a semipermeable mem-\nbrane, which separates the reacting ionic mixture and one of its constituents a [36].\nExcluding the possibility of tangential velocities at the wall and by assuming that the\ntemperature is continuous at the membrane, one obtains the following jump expres-\nsion,\n\nJ?\n??a\n\n??\n+\n\n1\n\n2\n(va ?unn)\n\n2K = 0 .\n\nThe first term on the left-hand side of the expression is named chemical potential,\n\u00b5?a , whereas the second one is the kinetic energy of the motion of the constituent a\nin relation to the semipermeable wall. Clearly, only the chemical potential is a con-\nstitutive quantity, and it is easily related to the Lagrange multiplier of concentration\nby \u00b5?a = ???a/??;\n\n44\n\n\n\n\u2022 The definition of ?? comes from the evaluation of equilibrium conditions for a viscous\nheat-conducting fluid, i.e., p = ????/?? [29, 74]. Then, because of the great excess\nof solvent mass in relation to the masses of other constituents, the dynamics of\na reacting ionic mixture is nearly the same as for a viscous heat-conducting fluid.\nConsequently, one may use the previous definition without loss of generality;\n\n\u2022 Since the constitutive properties of a reacting ionic mixture should not depend on\nexternal supplies, it suffices to consider supply-free mixtures. In other terms, the\nentropy supply vanishes as long as the linear momentum, spin, and energy sources\nare null,\n\n?b = 0 ,?l = 0 ,?r = 0 ? ?? = 0 .\n\n\u2022 The mixture is an isotropic medium. However, exceptionally, the degree of polar-\nization of the electrolyte solution and its constituents is completely determined by\na non-linear anisotropic function of type Pi = ?1ijEj + ?\n\n2\nijkEjEk + . . ., where ?\n\nm is\nthe m-th order electric susceptibility. In general, for weak electric fields, ?m is a\nconstant characteristic of the dielectric medium, and it depends on the temperature\nsince thermal agitation tends to oppose the order of electric dipoles induced by E\n[59]. Thus, owing to the great excess of solvent mass in relation to the masses of\nthe other constituents, the dielectric properties of the whole solution are due almost\nexclusively to the electric dipoles of water molecules.\n\nSubstituting the constitutive relations (4.2.3) and (4.2.4) into inequality (4.2.5) and by per-\nforming all required differentiations according to the chain-rule, one obtains\n\n? =\nd?\n\ndt\n\n(\n?\n??\n\n??\n? ?? ????\n\n??\n\n??\n+ ??E \u00b7\n\n?P\n\n??\n\n)\n+ (4.2.7)\n\nd??\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n???\n????\n\n??\n\n???\n+ ??E\n\n?P\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nd?a\ndt\n\n(\n?\n??\n\n??a\n????a ????\n\n??\n\n??a\n+ ??E \u00b7\n\n?P\n\n??a\n\n)\n+\n\nn?1?\nb=1\n\nd??b\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n???b\n????\n\n??\n\n???b\n+ ??E\n\n?P\n\n???b\n\n)\n+\n\ndW\n\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n?W\n????\n\n??\n\n?W\n+ ??E\n\n?P\n\n?W\n\n)\n+\nd?\n\ndt\n\u00b7 (??I??) +\n\nd??\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n???\n????\n\n??\n\n???\n+ ??E\n\n?P\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\n45\n\n\n\nd?\n\ndt\n\n(\n?\n??\n\n??\n????\n\n??\n\n??\n+ ??E \u00b7\n\n?P\n\n??\n\n)\n+\n\nd??\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n???\n????\n\n??\n\n???\n+ ??E\n\n?P\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\ndE\n\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n?E\n????\n\n??\n\n?E\n+ ??E\n\n?P\n\n?E\n\n)\n+\n\ndD\n\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n?D\n????\n\n??\n\n?D\n+ ??E\n\n?P\n\n?D\n\n)\n+\ndv\n\ndt\n\u00b7 (???v) +\n\n?? \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n??\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n??\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n??\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n??\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n??\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n??\n\n)\n+\n\n?(??) \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n???\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n???\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n???\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n???\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\nn?1?\nb=1\n\n??b \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n??b\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n??b\n\n????\na6=b\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n??b\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n??b\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n??b\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n??b\n\n)\n+\n\nn?1?\nb=1\n\n?(??b) \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n???b\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n???b\n\n????\na6=b\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n???b\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n???b\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n???b\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n???b\n\n)\n+\n\n?W \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n?W\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n?W\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n?W\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n?W\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n?W\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n?W\n\n)\n+\n\n?(??) \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n???\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n???\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n???\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n???\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\n?? \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n??\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n??\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n??\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n??\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n??\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n??\n\n)\n+\n\n?(??) \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n???\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n???\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n???\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n???\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\n?E \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n?E\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n?E\n\n+ ?v \u00b7 P + ?v\n?T\n\n?E\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n?E\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n?E\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n?E\n\n)\n+\n\n?D \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n?D\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n?D\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n?D\n+ ??\n\n?C\n\n?D\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n?D\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n?D\n\n)\n?\n\n2?? \u00b7 t? + ?? \u00b7 (P \u00d7 E) + ??T \u00b7D + 2??t? \u00b7?????1 \u00b7D+\n\n?G?odiv (E) + ?\nGq + ??C \u00b7?? +\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??aca + ?\n?i \u00b7 E ? 0 .\n\nAlternatively, inequality (4.2.7) can be expressed as\n\n46\n\n\n\n? = A (y) \u00b7 Z + B (y) ? 0 , (4.2.8)\n\nwhere A (y) and B (y) are respectively vector and scalar functions of the variables y listed\nin (4.2.3), but not of Z,\n\nZ ?\n{\nd?\n\ndt\n,\nd??\ndt\n\n,\nd?b\ndt\n,\nd??b\ndt\n\n,\nd?\n\ndt\n,\nd??\ndt\n\n,\ndW\n\ndt\n,\nd?\n\ndt\n,\nd??\ndt\n\n,\ndE\n\ndt\n,\ndD\n\ndt\n,\ndv\n\ndt\n, (4.2.9)\n\n?(??) ,?(??b) ,?(??) ,?E,?D,?W ,?(??) , div (E)} .\n\nHence, by the principle of local solvability [33, 35] Liu demonstrated that the inequality\n(4.2.8) must hold for arbitrary values of y and Z.

The thermodynamic potential, ? = ???? ? 1/?P \u00b7 E, is function of ?, ?a, ?, and E;\n\n2. The Lagrange multipliers of the balance equations of linear momentum, spin, and\nGauss law are zero:\n\n?? = 0 , ?v = 0 , ?G = 0 ;\n\n3. The extra entropy flux vector, ? = ? ?\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??aja ? ??h, which takes into account all\n\ndeviations of the entropy flux vector in relation to the heat and diffusive flux vectors,\ndoes not amount to a restriction.\n\nThe first statement follows from identities (4.2.11)2,4,5,6,8,10 which demonstrate a\nreduced independence on the list (4.2.3) for the thermodynamic potential ?. Then, with\nthe aid of the thermodynamic potential ? and the definitions of hydrostatic pressure,\np = ????/??, chemical potential, \u00b5?a = ???a/??, and coldness, ?? = 1/?, the identities\n(4.2.11)1,3,7,9 produce\n\n48\n\n\n\nd? =\np\n\n?2\nd? +\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5?ad?a ??d? ? P \u00b7d\n(\n\nE\n\n?\n\n)\n, (4.2.13)\n\nwhence ??/?? = p/?2 + P \u00b7 E/?2, ??/??a = \u00b5?a, ??/?? = ??, and ??/?E = ?P/?. If\nelectromagnetic fields are absent, relation (4.2.13) coincides with the Helmholtz relation\nof the classical thermostatics. However, the former is more comprehensive than that of\nclassical thermostatics because it holds for any point of the material body and it is valid\nunder equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions.\n\nMoreover, in view of previous constitutive assumptions presented, one demon-\nstrates by cross differentiation of the Liu identities (4.2.11)1,3,7,9 that ? = ?? (?,?,?a), ? =\n?? (?,?,?a), ?? = ??? (?,?,?a), and ??a = ???a (?,?,?a). One also shows from relation (4.2.13)\nand the reduced dependencies above that the integrability conditions for d? are\n\n?\u00b5?a\n??\n\n=\n? (p/?2)\n\n??a\n,\n\n? (p/?2)\n\n??\n= ?\n\n??\n\n??\n,\n\n?\u00b5?a\n??\n\n= ?\n??\n\n??a\n, (4.2.14)\n\nwhere P is function only of E, as previously stated.\nThe second statement is a direct result of identity (4.2.11)11 and it does not de-\n\nserve additional comments. On the other hand, the third statement results from iden-\ntity (4.2.12), which suggests the introduction of an extra entropy flux defined by ? =\n\n? ?\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??aja ? ??h. Here, it is worthwhile remembering that in obtaining the identities\n\n(4.2.12)1,2,5, the theorem of Cartesian decomposition of tensors was used in order to im-\npose that only the symmetric parts of ?(??), ?(??b), and ?(??) need to vanish. The\nproof of this statement can be easily found in reference [35].\n\nSubstituting the definition of extra entropy flux into identity (4.2.12), results in\n\nsym\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n\n)\n= sym\n\n(\n??\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?\u00b5?a\n???\n\nja\n\n)\n, sym\n\n(\n??\n\n???b\n\n)\n= sym\n\n(\n??\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?\u00b5?a\n???b\n\nja\n\n????\na6=b\n\n)\n(?b = 1, ..,n? 1) ,\n\n??\n\n?W\n= ??\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?\u00b5?a\n?W\n\nja ,\n??\n\n???\n= ??\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?\u00b5?a\n???\n\nja , (4.2.15)\n\nsym\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n\n)\n= sym\n\n(\n??\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?\u00b5?a\n???\n\nja\n\n)\n,\n\n??\n\n?E\n= ??\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?\u00b5?a\n?E\n\nja ,\n\n??\n\n?D\n= ??\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?\u00b5?a\n?D\n\nja .\n\n49\n\n\n\nWith the definition \u00b5?a = ???a/??, the reduced dependence of ??a should be reflected in\n\u00b5?a and, then, \u00b5?a = \u02c6?\u00b5a (?,?,?a). Consequently, since the derivatives above must vanish,\nsym (??/???) = 0, sym (??/???b) = 0, ??/?W = 0, ??/??? = 0, sym (??/???) = 0,\n??/?E = 0, and ??/?D = 0, the extra entropy flux vector is zero, and ? can be rewritten\n\nas ? = ??h ? ??\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5aja.\n\nAfter elimination of the linear terms, one uses ?\u00b5?a = (?\u00b5?a/??)??+\nn?1?\nb=1\n\n(?\u00b5?a/??b)??b|a6=b+\n\n(?\u00b5?a/??)?? and ? = ??h ? ??\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5?aja to rewrite inequality (4.2.7) as\n\n? = ?\nn?1?\na=1\n\nja \u00b7?\u00b5?a +\n\n(\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5?aja ? h\n\n)\n\u00b7\n??\n?\n\n+ C \u00b7??+ (4.2.16)\n\nT \u00b7D + p1 \u00b7D?\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5?aca + i \u00b7 E ? 0 ,\n\nwhence one may obtain other important thermodynamic restrictions on the constitutive\nrelations.\n\nNevertheless, before discussing the consequences of inequality (4.2.16) on the\nconstitutive quantities listed in (4.2.4), an important concept of chemical thermodynamics\ndeserves to be presented. The symmetrical of the chemical affinity of a reaction r is\n\nfr =\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?ar\u00b5?a , (4.2.17)\n\nwhere ?ar divided by the molecular mass of constituent a is proportional to the corre-\nsponding stoichiometric coefficient in the chemical reaction r, and the solvent is regarded\nas inert because of its great excess in the mixture. For the sake of convention, ?ar is taken\nas positive for the products of a reaction, and negative for the reagents. In addition, in\nagreement with Bedford and Bowen\u2019s ideas [2, 5, 7], the mass production of a is the net\nrate of mass supply to constituent a resulting from chemical reactions. Mathematically, the\nmass production of constituent a is expressed by\n\nca =\nR?\nr=1\n\n?ar?r , (4.2.18)\n\nwhere ?r is the rate of conversion of r, supposing R independent chemical reactions.\n\n50\n\n\n\nCombining Equations (4.2.17) and (4.2.18), one writes\nn?1?\na=1\n\nca\u00b5?a =\nR?\nr=1\n\nfr?r, and inequality\n\n(4.2.16) reduces to\n\n? = ?\nn?1?\na=1\n\nja \u00b7?\u00b5?a +\n\n(\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5?aja ? h\n\n)\n\u00b7\n??\n?\n\n+ C \u00b7?? + T \u00b7D+ (4.2.19)\n\np1 \u00b7D?\nR?\nr=1\n\nfr?r + i \u00b7 E ? 0 .\n\nInequality (4.2.19) is the residual entropy production and comprises a necessary\ncondition to inequality (4.2.5) to be maintained for any solution\n{? (x, t) ,?a (x, t) , v (x, t) ,? (x, t) ,? (x, t) , E (x, t)} of the field equations.\n\n4.2.1 Thermodynamic restrictions\n\nThe thermodynamic equilibrium state at (x, t) of a reacting ionic mixture is defined as that\nthermodynamic state in which the residual entropy production attains the minimum value,\nexpressly zero. This definition of local thermodynamic equilibrium state does not require\nthat the quantities ? ? {?r,??,?\u00b5?a, E,??,D} are time independent neither spatially\nhomogeneous nor null. In other words, this condition asserts that, at a material point, any\nlocal thermo-electromechanical state can be an equilibrium state provided the ? quantities\nhave appropriate values. As a consequence, ? must satisfy\n\n? : ? ? Y | ? ?{?r,??,?\u00b5?a, E,??,D} (4.2.20)(\n??\n\n??\n\n)????\nE\n\n= 0 ,\n\n(\n?2?\n\n????\n\n)????\nE\n\n? 0 ,\n\nwhere the index E stands for local equilibrium state.\nFrom inequality (4.2.19) and relation (4.2.20), the first-order derivatives of the\n\nresidual entropy production in relation to ?\u00b5?a, ??, and ?? result in(\n??\n\n??\u00b5?a\n\n)????\nE\n\n= ?ja = 0 (?a = 1, . . . ,n? 1) , (4.2.21)\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n\n)????\nE\n\n=\n1\n\n?\n\n(\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5?aja ? h\n\n)\n= 0 , (4.2.22)\n\n51\n\n\n\nor yet (\n??\n\n???\n\n)????\nE\n\n= ?\n1\n\n?\nh = 0 ,\n\nand (\n??\n\n???\n\n)????\nE\n\n= C = 0 . (4.2.23)\n\nHence, at local equilibrium, there are no diffusive fluxes of species neither flux of heat, nor\ncoupling stresses. Moreover, for ?r, inequality (4.2.19) and relation (4.2.20) lead to(\n\n??\n\n??r\n\n)????\nE\n\n= ?fr = 0 (?r = 1, . . . ,R) , (4.2.24)\n\nwhere the result above is the known local chemical equilibrium condition. Note that the\nlocal chemical equilibrium does not require local kinetic equilibrium, that is, the mass\nconcentrations time derivative of the constituents of the mixture may not be null. In fact,\nsince for non-homogeneous electrochemical systems Equation (2.2.7) holds, one easily\nobtains from relations (4.2.17) and (4.2.18),\n\n?\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?\u00b5?a\nd?a\ndt\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5?adiv (ja) = ?\nR?\nr=1\n\nfr?r , (4.2.25)\n\nwhence one concludes that if and only if ?fr = 0 for all r and div (ja) = 0 for all a, d?a/dt\nis zero.\n\nOther conditions to ensure ? = 0 at (x, t) are(\n??\n\n?D\n\n)????\nE\n\n= T + p1 = 0 (4.2.26)\n\nthat produces\n\nT = ?p1 ,\n\nand (\n??\n\n?E\n\n)????\nE\n\n= i = 0 . (4.2.27)\n\nIn addition, observe that the necessary conditions to obtain local thermodynamic\nequilibrium are different that characterize macroscopic thermodynamic equilibrium, viz. a\nstate in which all constituents are at rest in relation to one frame of reference and thermo-\n\n52\n\n\n\ndynamic quantities, such as temperature gradient, velocity gradient, rate of conversion of\na reaction etc. are time-independent and uniform [47]. On the other hand, one can ob-\ntain these conditions from the local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions by constructing\nappropriate Lyapunov functions through the definition of the entropy flux vector and the\nbalance equations, as shown in [12].\n\nThe constitutive modeling of reacting ionic mixtures proceeds by analyzing the\nsecond restriction invoked by the entropy principle on (4.2.4) to find restrictions on phe-\nnomenological parameters. For the sake of simplicity, it is imposed that the microscopic\nstructure of the system does not influence diffusive fluxes as well as the current flow.\nThus, the influence of local angular motion was considered only on the total stress tensor,\ncoupling stress tensor, and the heat flux, such as in references [14, 16, 32].\n\nFurthermore, unlike common electrolyte models, the fluxes of heat, mass and\nelectric current are not given exclusively by their usual sources, but also by the cross\nphenomena of thermo-electricity, thermal diffusion, and electrophoresis. Therefore, con-\nsidering the representation of isotropic constitutive functions [70, 71, 72], it follows that\n\nTij = ?p?ij +\n(\n? +\n\n2\n\n3\n?\n\n)\nDmm?ij + 2?D?ij + 2?eijk$k + O (2) , (4.2.28)\n\nCij =\n\n(\n? +\n\n2\n\n3\n?\n\n)\n?k,k?ij + 2???i,j + ??j,i + ?eijk?,k + O (2) ,\n\nhi = k1?,i + k2Ei + k3\u00b5?\na\n,i + k4eijk?k,j + O (2) ,\n\nii = ?1?,i + ?2Ei + ?3\u00b5?\na\n,i ,\n\njai = C\na\n1?,i + C\n\na\n2Ei + C\n\na\n3\u00b5?\n\na\n,i ,\n\nwhere D?ij and ??i,j are respectively the traceless part of D and ??, O (2) denotes the\nterms whose order is bigger than one in each constitutive function, and all phenomeno-\nlogical coefficients are functions of ?, ?, ?a, ??a \u00b7??a, ?? \u00b7??, E \u00b7 E, ??a \u00b7??, ??a \u00b7 E,\n?? \u00b7 E, and trD. Note that if the microscopic structure of the mixture had been included\nin the conduction current and the diffusive flux, new phenomenological coefficients should\nappear in Equations (4.2.28)4,5 whose physical meaning has not been clarified yet.\n\nDespite its inherent simplicity, Equation (4.2.28) is suitable to describe the diffu-\nsive and advective structures of electrolyte solutions far from the equilibrium. Nonetheless,\nas de Groot and Mazur [17] pointed out, the linear approximation for chemical reactions is\nnot justifiable, except near an equilibrium state when the chemical affinity holds a recipro-\ncal relation with the rate of conversion. Indeed, far from the equilibrium, chemical affinity\nis essentially a non-linear function of ?r, and its form varies according to the complexity of\n\n53\n\n\n\nthe reaction. Actually, the task of determining a phenomenological equation for fr is quite\ncomplicated and unusual in Chemistry. Then, on account of these arguments, chemical\naffinity is treated only in general terms without specifying its constitutive nature.\n\nInserting Equation (4.2.28) into inequality (4.2.19), the residual entropy inequality\nbecomes\n\n? = ?\nn?1?\na=1\n\n(\nCa1?,i + C\n\na\n2Ei + C\n\na\n3\u00b5?\n\na\n,i\n\n)\n\u00b5a,i +\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n(\nCa1?,i + C\n\na\n2Ei + C\n\na\n3\u00b5?\n\na\n,i\n\n)\n\u00b5a\n?,i\n?\n?

In turn, phenomenological coefficients Ca1 and k3 are characteristic for the\nphenomenon of thermal diffusion, k2 and ?1 for the thermoelectric phenomenon, and Ca2\nand ?3 for the electrophoretic phenomenon. All these effects mentioned are known as\ncross phenomena and they present reciprocal nature in contrast to Fick\u2019s law, Fourier\u2019s\nlaw, and Ohm\u2019s law. Viscous properties of the electrolyte solution are accounted for by\n? + 2/3?, ?, ?, ? + 2/3?, ?, ?, and ?, where ? + 2/3? and ? denote respectively the bulk and\nshear viscosities of Newtonian fluids, while ?+2/3?, ?, ?, and ? are the rotational viscosities\nthat arise due to the inner structure of the mixture. An electrolyte solution which presents\n\n54\n\n\n\nrotational viscosities constrained by (4.2.30)9,10,13,14 exhibits a resistance to motion bigger\nthan or equal to that of the viscous fluids under usual flow conditions.\n\nMoreover, if one neglects all phenomena with exception of the chemical reactions\nin inequality (4.2.29), one writes\n\n? = ?\nR?\nr=1\n\nfr?r ? 0 , (4.2.31)\n\nwhich is the criterion for spontaneity of chemical reactions.\n\n55\n\n\n\n56\n\n\n\n5 Electrochemical Systems: Transport\nPhenomena\n\nThe study of ion-ion and ion-solvent interactions aims to know whether ions interact dy-\nnamically with the solvent molecules and other ions in solution. In turn, the study of mass\ntransport in electrolyte mixtures covers diffusion and conductance of ions, where much of\nthe basis is phenomenological. As a matter of fact, one may study the mass transport in\nelectrolyte solutions by focusing on the individual motion of ions, that is, by following ions\ntrajectories in the electrolyte and the speeds with which they stream around. Nonetheless,\nbecause these ionic movements are of random nature with relation to direction and speed,\nit is quite hard to trace individual ions trajectories in the mixture, unless some radioactive\ntracer is used.\n\nConversely, one may investigate the mass transport in electrochemical systems\nby tracking the movement of a group of ions in a certain direction, producing a drift or flux.\nThis point of view is much more interesting than the first one since ionic drift results in\nmatter transport and flow of charge. Moreover, there is another aspect that justifies the\nanalysis of ionic drift, instead of the individual motion of ions: if a directional ionic flow\ndid not occur, the interfaces between the electrodes and electrolyte of an electrochemical\nsystem would be out of ions to maintain the charge-transfer reactions that happen at these\ninterfaces. Therefore, the drift of ions is of fundamental significance to the dynamics of an\nelectrochemical system.\n\nElectrochemistry literature [3, 4] supposes that a flux of ions can arise from three\nmechanisms. If there is a difference in the concentration of ions in different regions of\nthe electrolyte, the resulting concentration gradient produces a flow of ions, and the phe-\nnomenon is termed diffusion. If there is a difference in electric potential at various points\nin the electrolyte, then the resulting electric field produces a flow of charge in its direction,\nand the phenomenon is termed migration or conduction. Finally, if a difference in pressure,\ndensity or even temperature exists in various parts of the electrolyte, then there exists a\nfluid flow caused by natural or forced convection whose flow regime may be characterized\nby stagnant regions, laminar flow, turbulent flow, among others.\n\n57\n\n\n\nObviously, the relative contributions of diffusion and migration to the flux of a\nspecies differ at a certain instant for different locations in the electrochemical system.\nNear the electrode, an electroactive substance is, in general, transported by both pro-\ncesses. Differently, far from the electrodic surface, an electroactive substance is carried\nby the migrational mechanism, and the diffusion plays a secondary role because the con-\ncentration gradient is generally small in the bulk phase.\n\nFor many electrochemical systems, the mathematical treatments are simplified if\nthe migrational and convective components to the flux of the electroactive substance are\nmade negligible. This may be reached if an excess of supporting electrolyte\u2013 an electrolyte\nsolution whose constituents are not electroactive in the range of applied potentials and\nwhose ionic strength is usually much larger than that of the electroactive substance under\nconsideration\u2013 is added into the solution, and the electrochemical system is kept at rest.\nEven so, one needs more physical restrictions on the electrochemical system in order to\nobtain a simplified mathematical treatment.\n\nIn a more realistic description of electrochemical systems, where the temperature\nis not spatially uniform, it seems that the definitions above are not very convenient. In this\ncase, the theoretical framework provided by the classical electrochemistry literature may\nnot be comprehensive enough, and a new approach should be used. Such an approach\nis provided next.\n\n5.1 Proposed continuum model\n\nThe electrochemical system is regarded as an apolar material body formed by two regions:\na region of ionic conduction (bulk) and another that corresponds to an electrically charged\ninterface (double layer). The former is an isotropic medium whose concentration and\nelectric potential gradients of species are not significant. Consequently, the concentration\nof any species is virtually constant and the basic phenomena involve ion-solvent and ion-\nion interactions. On the other hand, the double layer is an inhomogeneous and anisotropic\nmedium in relation to the mass, heat and current fluxes, and it comprises the region where\nthe transfer of electrons between the electrode and the ionic solution takes place. For\nthe sake of simplicity, the anisotropy of the double layer is treated as a special case of\ntransverse isotropy, i.e., there is an isotropic plane such that all directions in this plane are\nequivalent and all constitutive relations remain unchanged under arbitrary rotations of a\ncoordinate system in relation to a major axis. Under these conditions, the fluxes of mass,\nheat and electric current present a preferred direction that is orthogonal to the isotropic\nplane.\n\n58\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the separation between the double layer and the bulk is marked by\nabrupt changes of the electric potential and species concentrations. Mathematically, these\nchanges are accounted for through a singular surface that separates the bulk and double\nlayer. At the singular surface, corresponding jump conditions for balance equations must\nbe formulated. Nevertheless, the properties of the singular surface are not examined in\nthis work.\n\n5.1.1 Bulk region\n\nIn order to investigate the occurring physical phenomena in the bulk region, the basic\nfields\u2013 mass density of the mixture, ? (x, t), mass concentration, ?a (x, t), empirical temper-\nature, ? (x, t), electric potential, ? (x, t), and velocity of the mixture, v (x, t)\u2013 are evaluated\nby regarding the bulk as a heat and electric conducting viscous mixture. Thus, most of its\nproperties are taken into account through the set of independent constitutive variables\n\ny ?{?,??,?a,?,??,?, v,?v} (a = 1, . . . ,n? 1) . (5.1.1)\n\nHowever, as the principle of material objectivity requires that constitutive quantities must\nnot depend on the observer, constitutive functions are independent of velocity, and they\nonly depend on the gradient of velocity through its symmetric part, represented by the\nstretching tensor D. Thus,\n\nC = C? (?,??,?a,?,??,?,D) , (5.1.2)\n\nwhere C ? {?, ?,T , P,?, h, i}.\nThe determination of the basic fields proceeds by evaluating the inequality,\n\n? =?\nd?\n\ndt\n+ div (?) ??? ? ??\n\n(\nd?\n\ndt\n+ ?div (v)\n\n)\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n(\n?\nd?a\ndt\n\n+ div (ja)\n\n)\n? (5.1.3)\n\n?v \u00b7\n(\n?\ndv\n\ndt\n? div (T ) + q????b + P \u00b7?(??)\n\n)\n?\n\n??\n(\n?\nd?\n\ndt\n+ div (h) ?T \u00b7?v ??r + P? \u00b7?? + i \u00b7??\n\n)\n?\n\n?G\n(\ndiv (P) + ?o?2?? q\n\n)\n? 0\n\nwhich does not need to hold for arbitrary fields ? (x, t), ?a (x, t), ? (x, t), ? (x, t), and v (x, t),\nbut rather for those that are solutions of the balance equations considered. Thus, one\n\n59\n\n\n\nmay take the balance equations as representing constraints on the fields that satisfy the\nentropy inequality [33].\n\nIn addition to the constitutive assumptions presented in the previous section,\nfurther hypotheses are necessary to guarantee the adequacy of the constitutive model.\nThese auxiliary hypotheses are valid for both bulk and double layer regions. They are:\n\n\u2022 The influence of interactions among the constituent particles on the system dynam-\nics is neglected. In fact, there are many reasons to consider the bulk and double layer\nas apolar media and, consequently, overlook these interactions. The first motive is\nassociated with the experimental difficulties in dealing with some phenomenological\ncoefficients that appear in the diffusive and electric current fluxes, which have not\nbeen experimentally well-established yet. The second reason concerns the experi-\nmental limitations of electrochemical devices in operating with concentrated or mod-\nerately concentrated mixtures. In this case, the approximation of ideal dilute solution\nis not valid, resulting in the lack of reliable data in the electrochemical literature for\nthese solutions. Finally, even if the influence of interactions among the constituents\nparticles on concentrations was taken into account through the activity of ions, the\nDebye-Hu?ckel model can no longer be used to relate the activity to the concentration\nof ions in non-dilute electrolyte solutions. Hence, if one desires to test the continuum\nmodel here proposed and compare the theoretical values obtained with the experi-\nmental ones, one should start with dilute solutions of 1.0 \u00d7 10?5 mol L?1\u20131.0 \u00d7 10?3\n\nmol L?1, where the contribution of interactions among species particles on mixture\ndynamics can be neglected;\n\n\u2022 The Lagrange multiplier for the energy equation is inversely proportional to the tem-\nperature,\n\n?? =\n1\n\n?\n.\n\nThis assumption is valid, provided one assumes the existence of an impermeable\nideal wall in electrochemical systems, where the entropy production vanishes, and\nthe entropy flux and the temperature are continuous;\n\n\u2022 Extending the definition of ??a provided in the last chapter to a medium under influ-\nence of quasi-electrostatic fields, ??a may be decomposed into an intrinsic constitu-\ntive part, a kinetic part, and an electric potential contribution, viz.\n\nJ?\n??a\n\n??\n+\n\n1\n\n2\n(va ?unn)\n\n2 ?za?K = 0 .\n\nThe intrinsic part of ??a is the chemical potential of a, \u00b5?a = ???a/??. On the other\n\n60\n\n\n\nhand, \u00b5a = \u00b5?a ?za? is the electrodynamic potential since the energy state of a con-\nstituent carrier of charge in any location of the electrolyte solution clearly depends\non the chemical environment and its own electric nature. Of course, if the chemical\nspecies is not a charge carrier, \u00b5a = \u00b5?a;\n\n\u2022 The term ca only deals with mass production due to electrodic reactions, i.e., reac-\ntions that take place at the electrode surface. Thus, ca = 0 for the bulk, and ca 6= 0\nfor the double layer;\n\n\u2022 As the medium is apolar, angular momentum balance indicates that the stress tensor\nis symmetric,\n\nT = TT ,\n\nand P \u00d7 E and all coupling terms in the balance equations may be neglected. Con-\nsequently, the degree of polarization of each region of an electrochemical system is\ncompletely determined by an isotropic function of type P = ??o?1??. Thus, thanks\nto the great excess of solvent mass in relation to the masses of other constituents,\nthe dielectric properties of each region of an electrochemical system are almost ex-\nclusively due to the solvent (water).\n\nIf the constitutive functions considered in (5.1.2) are introduced into inequality (5.1.3), and\nall differentiations are carried out according to the chain rule, the inequality (5.1.3) can be\nrewritten as\n\n? =\nd?\n\ndt\n\n(\n?\n??\n\n??\n? ?? ????\n\n??\n\n??\n? ???? \u00b7\n\n?P\n\n??\n\n)\n+ (5.1.4)\n\nd??\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n???\n????\n\n??\n\n???\n? ????\n\n?P\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nd?a\ndt\n\n(\n?\n??\n\n??a\n????a ????\n\n??\n\n??a\n? ???? \u00b7\n\n?P\n\n??a\n\n)\n+\n\nd?\n\ndt\n\n(\n?\n??\n\n??\n????\n\n??\n\n??\n? ???? \u00b7\n\n?P\n\n??\n\n)\n+\n\nd??\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n???\n????\n\n??\n\n???\n? ????\n\n?P\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\nd?\n\ndt\n\n(\n?\n??\n\n??\n????\n\n??\n\n??\n? ???? \u00b7\n\n?P\n\n??\n\n)\n+\n\ndD\n\ndt\n\u00b7\n(\n?\n??\n\n?D\n????\n\n??\n\n?D\n? ????\n\n?P\n\n?D\n\n)\n+\ndv\n\ndt\n\u00b7 (???v) +\n\n61\n\n\n\n?? \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n??\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n??\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n??\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n??\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n??\n\n)\n+\n\n?(??) \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n???\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n???\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n???\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\nn?1?\nb=1\n\n??b \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n??b\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n??b\n\n????\na6=b\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n??b\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n??b\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n??b\n\n)\n+\n\n?? \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n??\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n??\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n??\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n??\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n??\n\n)\n+\n\n?(??) \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n???\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n???\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n???\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n???\n\n)\n+\n\n?? \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n??\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n??\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n??\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n??\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n??\n? ??i\n\n)\n+\n\n?D \u00b7\n\n(\n??\n\n?D\n?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??a\n?ja\n?D\n\n+ ?v\n?T\n\n?D\n? ?G\n\n?P\n\n?D\n? ??\n\n?h\n\n?D\n\n)\n?\n\n?v \u00b7 [P \u00b7?(??)] + ??T \u00b7D????1 \u00b7D? ?G?o?2? + ?Gq ? 0 ,\n\nwhere ?o is homogeneous.

However, as the reduced dependence of ??a\n\n64\n\n\n\nreflects on \u00b5a, one has \u00b5a = \u00b5?a (?,?a,?,?), and from Equation (5.1.13), it follows that\nsym (??/???) = 0, ??/??b = 0, sym (??/???) = 0, and ??/?D = 0, though ??/?? is\nnot a null vector. Then, if one imposes that the extra entropy flux is an isotropic vector, ?\nis null because there are no scalar generators for an isotropic vector function [70, 71, 72].\n\nConsequently, Equation (5.1.13)4 becomes i = ?\nn?1?\na=1\n\n(?\u00b5a/??) ja. Applying the electrody-\n\nnamic potential definition, the latter can be simplified to the following expression i =\nn?1?\na=1\n\nia,\n\nwhich implies that the total current in the bulk is given by the algebraic sum of all flows of\ncharge carrier constituents, also known as faradaic currents.\n\nRecalling ? = 0, the definition of the mass Lagrange multiplier, and ?\u00b5a =\n\n(?\u00b5a/??)?? + (?\u00b5a/??)??, the entropy flux takes the form ? = ??h +\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??aja, and\n\ninequality (5.1.10) is rewritten as\n\n? = ?\n??\n?\n\u00b7 h ?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nja \u00b7?\u00b5a + T \u00b7D + p1 \u00b7D ? 0 . (5.1.14)\n\nThe left-hand side of expression (5.1.14) is the residual entropy production, a non-negative\nquantity for arbitrary values of {?,?a,?\u00b5a,?,??,?,D} . Whenever ? takes the zero value,\nthere is no entropy production, and one says that the point (x, t) is at a thermodynamic\nequilibrium state. Necessary conditions for ? = 0 at (x, t) are(\n\n??\n\n?yB\n\n)????\nE\n\n= 0 ,\n\n(\n?2?\n\n?yB?yB\n\n)????\nE\n\n? 0 , (5.1.15)\n\nwhere yB ?{??,?\u00b5a,D}, and the index E stands for the equilibrium state. Expressly, the\nheat conduction, the mass transport, and the deformations that occur in the electrolyte\nbulk are mechanisms that contribute to the production of residual entropy density.\n\nIn exploiting the first-order derivatives of ? with relation to yB, constraints are\nimposed on the constitutive quantities. Thus, immediate consequences of (5.1.15)1 are(\n\n??\n\n???\n\n)????\nE\n\n= ?\n1\n\n?\nh = 0 , (5.1.16)\n\n(\n??\n\n??\u00b5a\n\n)????\nE\n\n= ?ja = 0 (?a = 1, . . . ,n? 1) , (5.1.17)\n\nand\n\n65\n\n\n\n(\n??\n\n?D\n\n)????\nE\n\n= T + p1 = 0 , (5.1.18)\n\nT = ?p1 .\n\nRestrictions on constitutive functions also come from the second-order derivatives\nof ? with relation to yB. Supposing an isotropic Newtonian fluid and following the theorem\nof representation of isotropic functions [70, 71, 72], one writes in component form\n\nTij = ?p?ij +\n(\n? +\n\n2\n\n3\n?\n\n)\nDnn?ij + 2?D?ij + O (2) , (5.1.19)\n\nhi = k1?,i + k2\u00b5\na\n,i + O (2) ,\n\njai = C\na\n1\u00b5\n\na\n,i + C\n\na\n2?,i + O (2) ,\n\nwhere all phenomenological coefficients are material functions PB of type\n\nPB = P?B (?,?a,?,?,?? \u00b7??, trD) . (5.1.20)\n\nHere, one points out that the definition of diffusive flux employed in continuum thermody-\nnamics does not correspond to that of the classical electrochemistry literature [3, 4, 25]\npresented in the beginnings of this chapter. In continuum thermodynamics, the diffusive\nmotion is the relative motion of the particles of constituents in relation to the barycentric\nmotion and it is not exclusively due to the concentration gradient, unlike that found by the\nclassical electrochemistry approach. In fact, only if ?\u00b5a = (?\u00b5a/??a)??a and jai = Ca1\u00b5a,i,\nthe physical meanings of the diffusive flux in the classical electrochemistry and continuum\nthermodynamics approaches would be the same.\n\nThen, considering (5.1.19), the residual entropy inequality becomes\n\n? = ?k1\n?,i\n?\n?,i ?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa1\u00b5\na\n,i\u00b5\n\na\n,i ?\n\n(\nk2\n?\n\n+\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa2\n\n)\n?,i\u00b5\n\na\n,i+ (5.1.21)(\n\n? +\n2\n\n3\n?\n\n)\nD2nn + 2?D?ijD?ij ? 0 ,\n\nwhich implies the following restrictions on the phenomenological parameters\n\n66\n\n\n\nk1\n?\n? 0 ,\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa2 ?\nk2\n?\n? 0 ,\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa1 ? 0 , (5.1.22)\n\n? +\n2\n\n3\n? ? 0 , ? ? 0 ,\n\nwhere k1 is the thermal conductivity coefficient, Ca1 is the mass transport coefficient, C\na\n2\n\nand k2 are phenomenological coefficients related to thermophoresis, and ? and ? + 2/3?\nare the shear and bulk viscosities, respectively. Physically, the inequalities above evidence\nthat the heat flux vector opposes the temperature gradient (Fourier\u2019s law) as well as the\ndiffusive flux vector being opposed to the gradient of electrodynamic potential. Moreover,\nthe transport of matter through bulk is also caused by the coupling of heat and mass flows,\nand the particles of the electrolyte bulk flow in the direction of the shearing forces.\n\n5.1.2 Double-layer region\n\nIt has been long recognized that the introduction of an electrode under potential control\ninto an electrolyte solution disrupts the bulk solution structure, modifying the interactions\nthat occur between the ions/molecules in solution and the electrode surface. As a result,\ndifferent physical and chemical phenomena arise in the electrochemical system, and a\nnew constitutive class should be formulated.\n\nIn the double layer, one is interested in determining the same basic fields ac-\ncounted for in the bulk region, but, unlike there, one assumes that the double layer is a\nviscous heat and electric conducting mixture with chemical reactions and mass transport\ncaused by sources different than those in the bulk. Thus, the constitutive response of\ndouble layer depends on\n\nw ?{?,??,?,??,?a,??b,?,??, v,?v} (?a,b = 1, ...,n? 1) . (5.1.23)\n\nwhere C ? {ja,ca,T ,?, h, P, i,?, ?}.\nPrinciples of constitutive theory require that all variables listed in (5.1.23) are ob-\n\njective scalars, vectors, and tensors. In addition, all constitutive equations must obey the\nprinciple of material objectivity. Then, C does not depend explicitly on v, and it depends\non ?v only through its symmetric part D, that is,\n\n67\n\n\n\nw ?{?,??,?,??,?a,??b,?,??,D} (?a,b = 1, ...,n? 1) . (5.1.24)\n\nAccording to the method of Lagrange multipliers for exploitation of entropy inequal-\nity [33], there exist Lagrange multipliers ??, ??a , ?v, ??, and ?G that, whenever multiplied\nby their corresponding balance laws, they produce an inequality\n\n? =?\nd?\n\ndt\n+ div (?) ??? ? ??\n\n(\nd?\n\ndt\n+ ?div (v)\n\n)\n?

Since P is a func-\ntion of ?? and ?? depends exclusively on ?, by the cross differentiation of identity (5.1.28),\none proves that ? = ?? (?,?,?a), ? = ?? (?,?,?a), ?? = ??? (?,?,?a), ??a = ???a (?,?,?a,?), and\n\n? (p/?2)\n\n??\n= ?\n\n??\n\n??\n,\n\n?

Thus, one has the thermodynamic relation\n\nd? =\np\n\n?2\nd? +\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5ad?a ??d? + P \u00b7d\n(\n??\n?\n\n)\n, (5.1.32)\n\nwhence ? = ?? (?,?,?a,??).\nIn turn, from Liu identity (5.1.29), one introduces the extra entropy flux ? = ? ?\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??aja ? ??h, where ?v = 0 and ?G = 0 were used. Substituting the expression for the\n\nextra entropy flux into identity (5.1.29) and making use of definition of ??a , it follows that\n\n71\n\n\n\nsym\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n\n)\n= sym\n\n(\n??\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n?\u00b5a\n???\n\nja\n\n)\n, sym\n\n(\n??\n\n???b\n\n)\n= sym\n\n?\n??? n?1?\n\na=1\n\n?\u00b5a\n???b\n\nja\n\n?????\na6=b\n\n?\n?

Consequently, ? = 0, and then the entropy flux can be rewritten as\n\n? = ??h +\nn?1?\na=1\n\n??aja or ? = ??h ? ??\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5aja. Here, it is worth remembering that, unlike\n\nthe total current in the bulk region, i is not exclusively given by partial faradaic currents.\nIn fact, the total current in the double layer is due to the non-faradaic currents associated\nwith the charging of the electrical double layer at the electrode-solution interface, and the\nfaradaic currents corresponding to the reduction or oxidation of some chemical substance.\n\nIn view of the above restrictions, one uses ?\u00b5a = (?\u00b5a/??)??+\nn?1?\nb=1\n\n(?\u00b5a/??b)\n\n?????\na6=b\n\n??b+\n\n(?\u00b5a/??)?? + (?\u00b5a/??)?? and\nn?1?\na=1\n\nca\u00b5a =\nR?\nr=1\n\nfr?r to write inequality (5.1.30) as\n\n? = ?\nn?1?\na=1\n\nja \u00b7?\u00b5a +\n\n(\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5aja ? h\n\n)\n\u00b7\n??\n?\n\n+ T \u00b7D + p1 \u00b7D?\nR?\nr=1\n\nfr?r ? i \u00b7?? ? 0 .\n\n(5.1.34)\n\nInequality (5.1.34) evidences that some phenomena in an electrochemical system, e.g.\nelectrophoresis, electrodic reactions and Joule\u2019s effect, take place only in the double layer.\nMoreover, observe that the gradient of electrodynamic potential is given in terms of ??,\n??a, ??, and ??, unlike the bulk. As a consequence, the thermodynamic equilibrium\nstate at the point (x, t) in the double layer requires a more complex set of conditions than\nin the bulk.\n\nIn fact, one has the same necessary conditions to ensure ? = 0 at any (x, t) in\nthe double layer,\n\n72\n\n\n\n(\n??\n\n?wDB\n\n)????\nE\n\n= 0 ,\n\n(\n?2?\n\n?wDB?wDB\n\n)????\nE\n\n? 0 ,\n\nbut wDB is given by wDB ?{?\u00b5a,??,??, ?r,D}. Performing the first-order derivatives of\n? in relation to wDB, one obtains(\n\n??\n\n??\u00b5a\n\n)????\nE\n\n= ?ja = 0 (?a = 1, . . . ,n? 1) , (5.1.35)\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n\n)????\nE\n\n=\n1\n\n?\n\n(\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5aja ? h\n\n)\n= 0 (5.1.36)\n\n?\n1\n\n?\nh = 0 ,\n\n(\n??\n\n???\n\n)????\nE\n\n= ?i = 0 , (5.1.37)\n\n(\n??\n\n??r\n\n)????\nE\n\n= ?fr = 0 , (5.1.38)\n\n(\n??\n\n?D\n\n)????\nE\n\n= T + p1 = 0 (5.1.39)\n\nT = ?p1 ,\n\nwhence one concludes that, at the local thermodynamic equilibrium state, the mass flux,\nthe heat flux and the electric current flux vanish, the reactions are at chemical equilibrium,\nand the stress tensor is given by the hydrostatic pressure.\n\nIn order to evaluate further constraints on the constitutive quantities listed in (5.1.24),\nsome restrictions are imposed on the forms of the constitutive relations. If the gradients of\ntemperature, electrodynamic potential and electric potential and the strains are not very\nlarge, constitutive equations with only first-order terms are suitable for treatment of con-\nstitutive responses of the double layer. However, once more, linear constitutive functions\nfor chemical affinity are only suitable close to chemical equilibrium, otherwise fr presents\na highly non-linear relation to the rate of conversion ?r. In view of these arguments, the\nconstitutive relation for the chemical affinity of a reaction r is not discussed again.\n\nUnder these conditions, one considers the symmetry group M1? (V ), which char-\nacterizes transversely isotropic material bodies and next uses the theorem of representa-\n\n73\n\n\n\ntion of constitutive functions [34] to set\n\nTij = ?p?ij +\n(\n? +\n\n2\n\n3\n?\n\n)\nDmm?ij + 2?D?ij + O(2) , (5.1.40)\n\nhi = k1?,i + k2?,i +k3\u00b5\na\n,i + k4ni + O(2) ,\n\nii = ?1?,i + ?2?,i +?3\u00b5\na\n,i + ?4ni + O(2),\n\njai = C\na\n1?,i + C\n\na\n2?,i?C\n\na\n3\u00b5\n\na\n,i + C\n\na\n4ni + O(2) ,\n\nwhere all phenomenological coefficients are material functions PDB of the type\n\nPDB = P?DB (?,?,?,?a,?? \u00b7??,??a \u00b7??a,?? \u00b7??, trD) , (5.1.41)\n\nand the scalar product n \u00b7 n has been eliminated because it is equal to a unity. More-\nover, observe that the same phenomenological coefficients may be numerically different\nin the bulk and double layer (compare Equations (5.1.20) and (5.1.41)) since they are\nnot constants that depend only on the chemical species or medium under question, but\nconstitutive functions that suffer the influence of temperature, electric potential, viscosity\namong others. Finally, note that the current in the double layer region cannot be split up\ninto the migrational and diffusive components as usual because the physical meaning of\ndiffusive and migrational fluxes given in the electrochemistry literature does not coincide\nwith those of continuum thermodynamics.\n\nInserting Equation (5.1.40) into inequality (5.1.34), one obtains\n\n? = ?\nn?1?\na=1\n\n(\nCa1?,i + C\n\na\n2?,i +C\n\na\n3\u00b5\n\na\n,i + C\n\na\n4ni\n)\n\u00b5a,i +\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\n(\nCa1?,i + C\n\na\n2?,i +C\n\na\n3\u00b5\n\na\n,i + C\n\na\n4ni\n)\n\u00b5a\n?,i\n?\n?\n\n(5.1.42)\n\n(\nk1?,i + k2?,i +k3\u00b5\n\na\n,i + k4ni\n\n) ?,i\n?\n\n+\n\n(\n? +\n\n2\n\n3\n?\n\n)\nD2mm + 2?D?ikD?ik ?\n\nR?\nr=1\n\nfr?r?(\n?1?,i + ?2?,i +?3\u00b5\n\na\n,i + ?4ni\n\n)\n?,i? 0 ,\n\nand by carrying out the second-order derivatives of ? with relation to wDB, it results in\n\n74\n\n\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa3 ? 0 ,\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa1\u00b5\na\n\n?\n?\nk1\n?\n? 0 , ?2 ? 0 , (5.1.43)\n\n? +\n2\n\n3\n? ? 0 , ? ? 0 ,\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa4 ? 0 ,\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa4\u00b5\na\n\n?\n?\nk4\n?\n? 0 , ?4 ? 0 ,\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa2 + ?3 ? 0 ,\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa2\u00b5\na\n\n?\n?\nk2\n?\n? ?1 ? 0 ,\n\nn?1?\na=1\n\nCa1 +\nn?1?\na=1\n\n\u00b5aCa3\n?\n\n+\nk3\n?\n? 0 .\n\nThe phenomenological equations proposed in (5.1.40) incorporate many cross\nphenomena that are impossible to occur in the bulk region, such as thermoelectric and\nelectrophoretic effects, and thermal diffusion. These effects are due to the coupling of\nfields, which interfere in a reciprocal way in the heat, mass and electric current flows.\nFor example, Ca2 6= 0 and ?3 6= 0, both constrained by the condition (5.1.43)9, evidence\nthat the gradient of electric potential opposes the electrodynamic potential gradients of\nall ions. This thermodynamic condition recalls an important non-equilibrium phenomenon\nobserved in electrolyte solutions: the development of a diffusion potential. Whenever an\nelectrolyte is brought into contact with water, a gradient of electrodynamic potential arises\nfor both the positive and negative ions and, therefore, they start flowing away. Then, be-\ncause of the difference of ionic mobilities, there appears to be a tendency for segregation\nof cations and anions, so that a gradient of electric potential develops across the interface\nthat marks the local separation of ions. It is precisely this gradient of electric potential that\ninhibits the charge segregation as the accelerated cations face resistance to their motion,\nwhereas the slower anions are pushed up by the gradient of electric potential. Similar con-\nclusions can be obtained for the remaining phenomenological coefficients, where Ca1 6= 0\nand k1 6= 0 are related to the thermal diffusion, Ca2 6= 0 and k2 6= 0 to the thermoelectric\nphenomenon, and Ca3 6= 0 and k3 6= 0 to the electrophoretic effects.\n\nAlthough the constitutive nature of the chemical affinity will not be discussed be-\ncause of the reasons already presented, one can obtain the spontaneity criterion for elec-\ntrodic reactions from inequality (5.1.34), as in the expression (4.2.31).\n\n75\n\n\n\n76\n\n\n\n6 Final remarks\n\nA continuum model for electrochemical systems was developed with basis in the principles\nof constitutive theory and the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle. The mathematical formulation of\nthe thermodynamics of electrochemical systems was based on the balance laws of polar\ncontinuum mixtures and the Maxwell\u2019s laws under the quasi-electrostatic approximation.\nSome phenomena, such as diffusion, conduction of heat and electricity, deformation, po-\nlarization, and chemical reactions, including their coupling effects, were emphasized dur-\ning the constitutive modeling. In particular, a thermodynamic model for a dilute electrolyte\nsolution was introduced. It was shown that contrary to the Debye-Hu?ckel model, where\nions are regarded as non-polarizable hard spheres and deviations from ideality are exclu-\nsively due to the ion-ion interactions, the constitutive model here formulated can properly\ntake into account the effect of electrostriction, the coupling effect in the electrodiffusion\nprocesses, and the ion-solvent interactions.\n\nConstitutive models were also proposed for the bulk and double layer regions of\nan electrochemical system. While the material response of both regions was considered\nin the simplest way because the intensities of thermo-electromechanical fields are not so\nstrong, the bulk and double layer were modeled as isotropic and anisotropic media, re-\nspectively. In considering the transport phenomena in each region, it was demonstrated\nthat the concepts of diffusion and conduction flows in the classical electrochemistry litera-\nture do not coincide with those of modern continuum thermodynamics. In fact, according\nto continuum thermodynamics approach, one finds that diffusive fluxes are not directly\nrelated to the concentration gradients, but rather they are associated to the motion of a\nconstituent a relative to the barycentric motion. Moreover, comparison of residual entropy\nproductions of the bulk and double layer regions showed that some processes occur only\nin the double layer, thus resulting in stricter conditions for the local thermodynamic equi-\nlibrium.\n\nIn addition, the results presented in this work offered the possibility of discussing\ncertain fundamental concepts of modern continuum thermodynamics, in special, contin-\nuum mixtures theories. The concept of a continuum particle was clearly differentiated\nfrom the classical particles, such as ions, atoms, molecules etc. Basic equations were\n\n77\n\n\n\nstill modified in order to account properly for interactions among constituents particles,\nand physical quantities were analyzed in view of the characteristics of electrochemical\nsystems. Then, the Kelvin polarization force was assumed to represent ion-solvent inter-\nactions, ion-ion interactions were given by coulombic forces, and P\u00d7E was related to the\ntorques that electric dipoles of water molecules suffer due to the action of the electric field.\nAs a consequence of these intermolecular phenomena, the stress tensor is not symmetric,\naffecting linear and angular momenta conservation.\n\nA few comments were indeed addressed to the physical meaning of the Lagrange\nmultipliers, especially to the energy Lagrange multiplier. Even though, many thermody-\nnamicists claim that in a good application of the Mu?ller-Liu entropy principle, the consti-\ntutive dependence of any Lagrange multiplier must be reached as a final result of the\nentropy inequality, in this work coldness was assumed to be a universal function. While\nthis hypothesis is subject to criticism, by now, it seems quite hard to provide a constitutive\nmodel for continuum mixtures without accepting that ?? = 1/? as the problem of non-ideal\nmaterial surfaces in continuum mixtures does not have a solution yet. Thus, the reliability\nof the constitutive model provided here deserves to be investigated as well as whether the\ndefinition ?? = 1/? is appropriate for non-equilibrium systems.\n\nTherefore, with the results obtained in this work, one intends that the Mu?ller-Liu\nentropy principle is not viewed as a mathematical method whence one obtains thermody-\nnamic relations without inquiring whether the results make physical sense or not. On the\ncondition that concepts of modern continuum thermodynamics are correctly applied, and a\nproper formulation for the second law is employed, one can obtain a more comprehensive\nthermodynamic theory for non-equilibrium systems without using the Onsager reciprocal\nrelations.\n\n78\n\n\n\n7 Appendix I\n\nLet U and V be two vector spaces with inner product. A mapping\n\nL(U,V ) = {T : U ? V}\n\nis called a linear transformation T , if for any u, y ? U, and a ? R,\n\nT (u + ay) = T (u) + aT (y) .\n\nIf the mapping L(U,V ) is specified by\n\nL(V,V ) = {T : V ? V} ,\n\nwhere L(V,V ) = L(V ) = V ?V , then the linear transformations T in L(V ) are second-\norder tensors.\n\nHence, Q?L(V ) is an orthogonal transformation, if the inner product of V for all\nvectors u, y ? V is preserved:\n\nQu \u00b7Qy = u \u00b7 y .\n\nIf Q is an orthogonal transformation, thus\n\n1. QT = Q?1,\n\n2. detQ = \u00b11,\n\n3. |Qv| = |v|,\n\n4. ` (Qv,Qu) = ` (v, u) ? [0, 90o],\n\nand it forms an orthogonal group O (V ). Furthermore, if detQ = 1, so the orthogonal group\nis a proper orthogonal group or a rotation group O+ (V ) because its elements represent\nrotations.\n\nNow, let a linear transformation T ?L(V ) be, such that\n\n1. |detT | = 1,\n\n79\n\n\n\n2. detT = 1.\n\nThe set of linear transformations T , which satisfies the first condition above, forms the\nunimodular group U (V ) of the vector space, whereas the set of linear transformations T ,\nwhich satisfies the second condition, constitutes the special linear group SL(V ) . Evi-\ndently, O (V ) ?U (V ) and O+ (V ) ?SL(V ).\n\n80\n\n\n\n8 Appendix II\n\nLet an arbitrary tensor O = A + B, such that A ? SYM(V ) and B ? SKW (V ). The\ncross product of a vector y ? V with A [6, 29] is defined as\n\ny \u00d7A = eijkyiA(jl)ck ? cl ,\n\nwhereas y \u00d7B is given by\n\ny \u00d7B = eijkyiB[jl]ck ? cl ,\n\nwhere ?ijk = eijk is the permutation symbol when the basis ci is orthonormal.\nNow, let the divergent of y \u00d7A, which is defined in component form as\n\ndiv (y \u00d7A) =\n(\neijkyiA(jl)\n\n)\n,l\n\n=eijkyiA(jl),l + eijkyi,lA(jl) .\n\nSince one has yi,l = ?il, it follows that\n\ndiv (y \u00d7A) =eijkAji + eijkyiA(jl),l ,\n\nwhich is reduced to\n\ndiv (y \u00d7A) =y \u00d7 div (A)\n\n=eijkyiA(jl),l ,\n\nbecause eijkAji = 0.\nIn addition, the divergent of y \u00d7B is also defined in component form as\n\n81\n\n\n\ndiv (y \u00d7B) =\n(\neijkyiB[jl]\n\n)\n,l\n\n=eijkyiB[jl],l + eijkyi,lB[jl] .\n\nBut, if the identity yi,l = ?il is used, the vector identity above reduces to\n\ndiv (y \u00d7B) =y \u00d7 div (B) + 2b?\n\n=eijkyiB[jl],l + eijkB[ji] ,\n\nwhere b?k = 1/2eijkB[ji] is the dual or axial vector associated with the skew-symmetric tensor\nB.\n\n82\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] ARRHENIUS, S.
