Foi com essa finalidade que este \ndoutorado visou desenvolver metodologias para o monitoramento das atividades termais dos vulc\u00f5es \nobservados do espa\u00e7o.

Essas metodologias utilizam as melhores resolu\u00e7\u00f5es de cada um dos sensors: \nespacial (ASTER), temporal (MODIS) , espectral (Hyperion) podem ser automaticamente executadas  em \nescala global.

This can be done on a global \nscale using satellite sensors. The goal of this doctorate was to develop methods for the monitoring of \nvolcanic thermal activity from space. This was achieved through the use of a variety of orbital infrared \nsensors. The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), which offers \nmoderate to high spatial resolution imagery (30 \u2013 90 m) in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) and thermal \ninfrared (TIR), was used to characterize the size and intensity of thermal anomalies. Its TIR channels were \ncapable of detecting subtle thermal anomalies. This permitted the observation of new thermal precursors \nto eruptive events. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) offers high temporal \nresolution imagery (i.e. daily global coverage). It was therefore used to investigate thermal activity \nthrough time. Wavelet analysis was used to quantify the time period over which such activity oscillates. \nHyperion is an orbiting imaging spectrometer. It was used to demonstrate a new method for calculating \nradiant flux from thermally heterogeneous targets (i.e. such as volcanoes). These methods utilized the \nstrengths of each sensor system, i.e. high spatial, temporal or spectral resolution. They all improve the \nability to detect and/or quantify thermal anomalies from space and can be executed in an automated global \nbasis. This thesis therefore presents a solid foundation on which the next generation global volcano \nmonitoring system can be based. \n \n \nKeywords: Remote Sensing, Volcanoes \n\nxvii \n \n\n\n\nxviii \n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxix \n \n\nIndex \n\n \n\n \n\nCap\u00edtulo 1.

O desequil\u00edbrio termodin\u00e2mico entre o interior e a crosta \n\nterrestre, leva a uma transfer\u00eancia de energia (calor) do interior em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 crosta. Esta \n\ntransfer\u00eancia de energia t\u00e9rmica em escala planet\u00e1ria manifesta-se mais claramente sob a forma \n\nde vulc\u00f5es. Dada \u00e0 magnitude desse processo, os vulc\u00f5es desempenham m\u00faltiplas influ\u00eancias \n\ndentro do sistema terrestre e s\u00e3o essenciais para a compreens\u00e3o do funcionamento do nosso \n\nplaneta. \n\n Ao longo da hist\u00f3ria geol\u00f3gica a atividade vulc\u00e2nica tem provocado efeitos dram\u00e1ticos \n\nsobre a composi\u00e7\u00e3o da atmosfera, o clima da Terra, a extin\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies e a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nminerais no que, ao longo do tempo, tornou-se o que s\u00e3o agora corpos de min\u00e9rio. Os dep\u00f3sitos \n\nvulc\u00e2nicos tamb\u00e9m oferecem informa\u00e7\u00f5es valiosas sobre a din\u00e2mica e composi\u00e7\u00e3o interna da \n\nTerra atrav\u00e9s do tempo, especialmente por estes dep\u00f3sitos serem nossas \u00fanicas fontes de \n\namostras do manto. Entretanto \u00e9 evidente que a atividade vulc\u00e2nica contempor\u00e2nea tamb\u00e9m \n\napresenta uma s\u00e9rie de riscos para a sociedade, incluindo a perda de vidas humanas e graves \n\nimpactos na economia e infraestrutura. \n\n Grande parte dos vulc\u00f5es ativos n\u00e3o possuem um programa de monitoramento espec\u00edfico, \n\numa vez que as escalas de tempo vulc\u00e2nicas frequentemente parecem longas quando comparadas \n\n\u00e0s escalas de tempo humanas e os vulc\u00f5es est\u00e3o localizados em diferentes locais do globo. No \n\nentanto, existem cerca de 20 erup\u00e7\u00f5es ocorrendo simultaneamente e, tipicamente, cerca de 60 \n\nerup\u00e7\u00f5es ocorrem por ano no mundo. Esta lacuna no monitoramento apresenta perigo e poder\u00e1 \n\n\n\n2 \n \n\nresultar na perda de vida e bens materias que seriam evit\u00e1veis com um monitoramento mais \n\naperfei\u00e7oado. Neste cen\u00e1rio, os sensores espaciais fornecem o \u00fanico meio de preencher esta \n\nlacuna em escala global. \n\n O perigo causado pela atividade vulc\u00e2nica \u00e9 um problema global que, direta ou \n\nindiretamente, afeta uma grande parte da popula\u00e7\u00e3o mundial. Considerando atrav\u00e9s de uma \n\nperspectiva sul-americana, vemos que a maioria da costa ocidental deste continente \u00e9 ativa. Isso \u00e9 \n\nocasionado principalmente pela subduc\u00e7\u00e3o da placa de Nazca sob a placa Sul-americana e tem \n\nimplica\u00e7\u00f5es para todo o continente, j\u00e1 que \u00e1reas vastas podem ser afetadas por plumas de cinzas \n\nvulc\u00e2nicas. Um exemplo \u00e9 a erup\u00e7\u00e3o de 1993 do L\u00e1scar (Chile) que causou a queda de tephra \n\n(i.e. cinzas vulc\u00e2nicas) em Porto Alegre (Brasil) apesar da dist\u00e2ncia de 1800 km. Mais \n\nrecentemente (i.e. junho de 2011), a atividade do vulc\u00e3o Puyehue (Chile) formou uma nuvem de \n\ncinzas que foi do Chile e atravessou a Argentina chegando at\u00e9 ao Oceano Atl\u00e2ntico (Fig. 1.1). \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigura 1.1. Imagem de MODIS (cor verdadeira) da erup\u00e7\u00e3o de Puyehue (Chile) em junho \n\nde 2011. A nuvem de cinzas viajou NNE e depois ESE, atravessando a Argentina. Voos \n\nforam cancelados na Argentina, Brasil e outros pa\u00edses sul-americanos. \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n \n\nComo resultado, voos de chegada e partida do aeroporto internacional de Buenos Aires (situado \n\ncerca de 1400 km de dist\u00e2ncia do vulc\u00e3o) foram cancelados, incluindo aqueles com embarque de \n\npassageiros brasileiros. A tend\u00eancia \u00e9 que transtornos como esses ocorram com mais frequ\u00eancia \n\nno futuro, devido \u00e0 crescente densidade do tr\u00e1fego a\u00e9reo na regi\u00e3o. A consequ\u00eancia de tais \n\natividades vulc\u00e2nicas pode incluir enormes danos financeiros gerados pelo impacto adverso nos \n\nneg\u00f3cios e com\u00e9rcio. Um exemplo \u00e9 a parada do espa\u00e7o a\u00e9reo europeu por v\u00e1rios dias em mar\u00e7o \n\nde 2010, em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da erup\u00e7\u00e3o do Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (Isl\u00e2ndia). \u00c9 imperativo, portanto, desenvolver \n\nt\u00e9cnicas de monitoramento atrav\u00e9s das quais seja poss\u00edvel desenvolver um sistema eficaz para \n\nminimizar os perigos causados pelas erup\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\n O objetivo deste trabalho consistiu em explorar o uso de imagens de sat\u00e9lite para a \n\nobserva\u00e7\u00e3o e quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o de anomalias termais vulc\u00e2nicas. As metodologias desenvolvidas para \n\ndetectar e descrever tal atividade foram projetadas para ser implementadas em um contexto de \n\nmonitoramento. Desta forma elas podem ser executadas automaticamente por um computador e \n\ns\u00e3o globalmente aplic\u00e1veis. \n\n H\u00e1 uma ampla variedade na capacidade dos sensores orbitais devido \u00e0 rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a \n\nresolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial, a temporal e a espectral. Foi investigado nesse trabalho o uso de diferentes \n\ntipos de sensores os quais fornecem, coletivamente, uma alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o em cada categoria. Isso \u00e9 \n\nimportante porque os fen\u00f4menos vulc\u00e2nicos ocorrem ao longo de escalas temporais e espaciais \n\nextensas e cujo comportamento apresenta forte depend\u00eancia do comprimento de onda. Imagens \n\nde alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial podem ser utilizadas para restringir o tamanho, forma, localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\norienta\u00e7\u00e3o de anomalias termais. Dados de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal podem ser usados para \n\nmonitorar mudan\u00e7as din\u00e2micas na atividade t\u00e9rmica e observar eventos ef\u00eameros. A alta \n\nresolu\u00e7\u00e3o espectral permite a melhor caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da energia radiante e oferece a possibilidade \n\nde realizar an\u00e1lises subpixel. \n\n Os dados dos seguintes sistemas de sensores existentes foram utilizados na pesquisa: i) o \n\nAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), que fornece \n\nimagens de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial (30 m) no infravermelho de ondas curtas (SWIR, 1,5 - 3 ?m) e \n\nm\u00e9dia resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial (90 m) no infravermelho termal (TIR, 8-13 ?m); ii) o MODerate \n\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), que fornece imagens de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ntemporal no SWIR, no infravermelho m\u00e9dio (MIR, 3 - 5 ?m) e no TIR; e iii) o Hyperion, que \u00e9 \n\num espectr\u00f4metro imageador no SWIR. Os dados destes sistemas foram analisados no contexto \n\n\n\n4 \n \n\nda atividade vulc\u00e2nica, descritos por relat\u00f3rios de campo, com o objetivo de explorar o seu \n\npotencial como precursores de erup\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\n O sensor ASTER \u00e9 capaz de detectar anomalias termais sutis utilizando suas bandas no \n\nTIR. Imagens deste sensor foram usadas para quantificar o tamanho e intensidade de anomalias \n\ntermais durante uma s\u00e9rie de tempo decenal em uma gama de vulc\u00f5es: Erebus (Ant\u00e1rtica), L\u00e1scar \n\n(Chile), K?lauea (Hava\u00ed), Erta \u2018Ale (Eti\u00f3pia) e Kliuchevskoi (R\u00fassia). Nos vulc\u00f5es L\u00e1scar e \n\nKliuchevskoi foram identificados precursores termais relacionados \u00e0 atividade eruptiva. Tais \n\nprecursores podem formar a base de futuros sistemas automatizados de alerta. \n\n MODIS foi utilizado para caracterizar a atividade do L\u00e1scar, K?lauea, Erta \u2018Ale e \n\nKliuchevskoi. Muitas das imagens ASTER e MODIS foram adquiridas contemporaneamente, \n\numa vez que os dois sensores est\u00e3o a bordo do mesmo sat\u00e9lite (i.e. Terra). Isto permitiu explorar \n\na sinergia entre os dois sensores. A atividade t\u00e9rmica, detectada pelo MODIS, foi descrita usando \n\numa medida simples de radi\u00e2ncia vulc\u00e2nica. Foram realizadas tamb\u00e9m an\u00e1lises avan\u00e7adas de \n\ns\u00e9ries temporais utilizando dados MODIS atrav\u00e9s de wavelets. Isso permitiu investigar a \n\nperiodicidade na s\u00e9rie de tempo observada, permitindo assim a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o do intervalo durante \n\no qual a radi\u00e2ncia aumentava e diminu\u00eda e o per\u00edodo de repouso entre os eventos, o que fornece \n\nindica\u00e7\u00f5es importantes sobre a probabilidade de futuras erup\u00e7\u00f5es (Marzocchi e Zaccarelli, 2006) \n\ne, portanto, sua quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o objetiva poder contribuir para os esfor\u00e7os de previs\u00e3o no futuro. \n\n Para detectar anomalias termais \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio quantificar o comportamento normal, bem \n\ncomo os desvios anormais. Isso exigiu o desenvolvimento de uma abordagem inovadora para a \n\nsele\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura de background para os dados ASTER, bem como a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de limiares \n\nde anomalia espec\u00edficos para o MODIS. Anomalias termais em dados Hyperion foram \n\nidentificados utilizando um limiar de radi\u00e2ncia. Uma vez identificada uma anomalia, \u00e9 \n\nfundamental que as m\u00e9tricas utilizadas para descrever a atividade vulc\u00e2nica t\u00e9rmica sejam \n\nvi\u00e1veis. Ao longo dos \u00faltimos 30 anos, uma grande quantidade de aten\u00e7\u00e3o tem sido dada \u00e0 an\u00e1lise \n\nsubpixel de imagens de alvos vulc\u00e2nicos. Isto ocorre devido \u00e0s superf\u00edcies vulc\u00e2nicas ativas \n\nserem, com frequ\u00eancia, termicamente heterog\u00eaneas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 escala espacial de um pixel. Isso \n\nquer dizer que um \u00fanico valor de temperatura ou radi\u00e2ncia n\u00e3o descreveria toda a complexidade \n\nt\u00e9rmica de superf\u00edcies com atividades vulc\u00e2nicas. \n\n Neste estudo foi explorada a capacidade de espectr\u00f4metros imageadores, tais como \n\nHyperion, para resolver caracter\u00edsticas subpixel (i.e. o n\u00famero, tamanho e temperatura das \n\n\n\n5 \n \n\ncomponentes isot\u00e9rmicas menores de um pixel). Tal objetivo foi atingido atrav\u00e9s do \n\ndesenvolvimento de um m\u00e9todo para a modelagem inversa do espectro de radia\u00e7\u00e3o, a partir do \n\nqual as caracter\u00edsticas subpixel podem ser derivadas. Este m\u00e9todo foi testado utilizando testes do \n\ntipo Monte Carlo que mostrou a precis\u00e3o da metodologia desenvolvida (erros entre 3 e 5%). \n\nTodavia, mesmo neste n\u00edvel de precis\u00e3o, n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel resolver de forma confi\u00e1vel as \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas subpixel. Teoricamente a precis\u00e3o do modelo, se aprimorada, poderia aumentar a \n\nconfiabilidade nas solu\u00e7\u00f5es subpixel. Na pr\u00e1tica, por\u00e9m, isto n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel devido \u00e0s limita\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nna precis\u00e3o de medida dos espectros de radia\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim, \u00e9 improv\u00e1vel que se possa, de forma \n\nconfi\u00e1vel, determinar caracter\u00edsticas subpixel de imagens de vulc\u00f5es ativos por meio de \n\ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o espectral. Tal fato tem implica\u00e7\u00f5es profundas, dada a extens\u00e3o em que os autores \n\nanteriores tentaram resolver estes par\u00e2metros durante as \u00faltimas tr\u00eas d\u00e9cadas. \n\n Sendo assim, definimos uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o alternativa. Fluxo radiante e excit\u00e2ncia s\u00e3o duas \n\nm\u00e9tricas (relacionadas) que podem ser utilizadas para descrever, de forma confi\u00e1vel e \n\nsignificativa, a atividade t\u00e9rmica mesmo de superf\u00edcies com altos gradientes de temperatura. Por \n\nmeio destes dados, desenvolvemos um m\u00e9todo para calcular estes par\u00e2metros que \u00e9 \n\ncomputacionalmente eficiente e, portanto, r\u00e1pido o suficiente para ser executado por \n\ncomputadores \u00e0 bordo dos sistemas de sensores para processamento em rota. N\u00f3s fornecemos um \n\nexemplo pr\u00e1tico desta abordagem utilizando dados do Hyperion de um fluxo de lava no vulc\u00e3o \n\nKliuchevskoi. \n\n Esta tese est\u00e1 organizada da seguinte forma. Uma revis\u00e3o fundamental de princ\u00edpios \n\ncient\u00edficos e do estado da arte \u00e9 fornecida no Cap\u00edtulo 2. Este \u00e9 seguido por cap\u00edtulos que s\u00e3o \n\ncompostos de artigos que foram publicados, aceitos ou prestes a serem submetidos em revistas \n\ninternacionais.

O Cap\u00edtulo 4 investiga o \n\ndesenvolvimento de uma sinergia entre ASTER e MODIS, bem como a demonstra\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da an\u00e1lise de wavelet em dados MODIS.

The thermodynamic disequilibrium between the hotter \n\nterrestrial interior and the colder terrestrial crust leads towards a net transfer of heat energy in the \n\ndirection of the cold space through which the planet traverses. This transfer of heat energy on a \n\nplanetary scale manifests itself most clearly in the form of volcanoes. Given the magnitude of this \n\nprocess volcanoes play a number of influential roles within the Earth system and are integral \n\ntowards our understanding of how the planet works. \n\n Throughout geological history volcanic activity has had dramatic effects on the \n\ncomposition of the atmosphere, the climate of the Earth, the extinction of species and the \n\nconcentration of minerals into what have now become ore bodies. Volcanic deposits also offer \n\nvaluable insights into the dynamics and composition of the Earth through time; including our \n\nonly samples of the mantle. Clearly, however, contemporary volcanic activity also poses a \n\nnumber of hazards to society including loss of human life and severe impacts on economy and \n\ninfrastructure. \n\n Volcanic time scales often appear long compared to human time scales, furthermore \n\nvolcanoes are dispersed around the globe, consequently most active volcanoes have no dedicated \n\nmonitoring program. Yet, at any one time, there are some 20 eruptions occurring simultaneously \n\nand there are typically around 60 eruptions per year. This perilous monitoring gap will inevitably \n\n\n\n8 \n \n\nresult in the avoidable loss of life and material property. Spaceborne sensors provide the only \n\nmeans at present for filling this gap on a global scale. \n\n Volcanic hazard is a global issue that directly or indirectly affects a large proportion of \n\nthe world\u2019s population. From a South American perspective the majority of the West coast of this \n\ncontinent is volcanically active, principally due to subduction of the Nazca Plate below the South \n\nAmerican Plate. This has implications for the entire continent given the truly enormous areas that \n\ncan be affected by volcanic ash plumes. The 1993 eruption of L\u00e1scar (Chile) caused tephra (i.e. \n\nvolcanic ash) fall-out over Porto Alegre (Brazil) some 1800 km away. More recently (i.e. June \n\n2011) activity at Puyehue volcano (Chile) formed an ash plume that traversed from Chile through \n\nArgentina into the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 1.1). \n\n  \n\n  \n\nFigure 1.1. A MODIS true colour image of the Puyehue (Chile) eruption in June 2011. The ash \n\nplume is seen travelling NNE before sweeping ESE across Argentina. Flights were cancelled at \n\nArgentinean, Brazilian and other South-American airports. \n\n \n\nFlights, including those to be boarded by Brazilian passengers, were cancelled to and from \n\nBuenos Aires International Airport (i.e. situated some 1400 km away from the volcano). \n\nDisruptions such as these are likely to occur more frequently in the future due to the ever \n\n\n\n9 \n \n\nincreasing density of air-traffic in the region. The consequences of such disruptions can include \n\npotentially enormous financial loss through adverse affects on business and trade, as recently \n\noccurred after European airspace was closed for a few days in March 2010 following the eruption \n\nof Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (Iceland). It is therefore imperative to develop monitoring techniques upon \n\nwhich effective hazard mitigation strategy can be based. \n\n The aim of this thesis is to explore the use of infrared imagery from satellite sensors for \n\nthe observation and quantification of volcanic thermal anomalies. The methodologies developed \n\nto detect and describe such activity have been designed for implementation in a monitoring \n\ncontext; thus they can be executed automatically by a computer and are globally applicable. This \n\nthesis therefore works towards improving the global volcano monitoring system. \n\n Orbital sensors have a wide variety of capabilities that are borne out of a trade-off \n\nbetween spatial, temporal and spectral resolution. Image data from a single sensor system might \n\ntherefore have a high resolution in up to two of these categories; but not all three. This is \n\nprimarily due to limitations in existing imaging technology and data transfer rates. I investigated \n\nthe use of different sensor types that collectively provide high resolution in each category. This is \n\nof importance because volcanic phenomena occur over wide temporal and spatial scales and \n\nexhibit strong wavelength dependent behaviour. High spatial resolution images can be used to \n\nconstrain the size, shape, location and orientation of thermal anomalies. High temporal resolution \n\ndata can be used to monitor dynamic changes in thermal activity as well as to observe ephemeral \n\nevents, and high spectral resolution allows radiant energy to be better characterized, and offers \n\nthe possibility to carry out advanced subpixel analysis. \n\n Data from the following existing sensor systems were utilised in this research: i) the \n\nAdvanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), which provided \n\nhigh spatial resolution imagery in the Short-Wave InfraRed (i.e. SWIR, 1.5 - 3 ?m) and moderate \n\nspatial resolution imagery in the Thermal InfraRed (i.e. TIR, 8 - 13 ?m); ii) the MODerate \n\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which provided high temporal resolution \n\nimagery in the SWIR, mid wave infrared (i.e. MIR, 3 - 5 ?m) and TIR; and iii) Hyperion which is \n\na SWIR imaging spectrometer. The data from these separate sensor systems were analyzed in the \n\ncontext of volcanic activity, as described by field reports, and with the aim of exploring their \n\npotential as eruptive precursors. \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\n The ASTER sensor was capable of detecting subtle thermal anomalies using its TIR \n\nbands. Images from this sensor were used to quantify the size and intensity of thermal anomalies \n\nover a decadal time series at a range of volcanoes, namely: Erebus (Antarctica), L\u00e1scar (Chile), \n\nK?lauea (Hawai'i), Erta \u2018Ale (Ethiopia) and Kliuchevskoi (Russia). Thermal precursors to \n\neruptive activity were identified at L\u00e1scar and Kliuchevskoi, such precursors might form the \n\nbasis of future automated alert systems. \n\n MODIS was used to characterize activity at L\u00e1scar, K?lauea, Erta \u2018Ale and Kliuchevskoi. \n\nMany of the ASTER and MODIS images were acquired contemporaneously as both sensors are \n\non board the same satellite (i.e. Terra). This allowed a synergy between the two sensors to be \n\nexplored. Thermal activity, as seen by MODIS, was described using a straightforward metric of \n\nvolcanic radiance. Advanced time series analysis was carried out on the MODIS data sets through \n\nthe use of wavelets. This allowed periodicity in the time series to be investigated, allowing the \n\nquantification of the period over which thermal activity waxed and waned, as well as the length \n\nof repose between events, to be defined. Waxing, waning and repose provide important \n\nindications on the probability of future eruptions (Marzocchi and Zaccarelli, 2006) and therefore \n\ntheir objective quantification may contribute to forecasting efforts in the future. \n\n In order to detect thermal anomalies it is necessary to be able to quantify normal \n\nbehaviour as well as abnormal deviations from it. This required that we develop an innovative \n\napproach to background temperature selection for ASTER data as well as to define volcano \n\nspecific anomaly thresholds for MODIS. Anomalies in Hyperion data were defined using a \n\nsimple radiance threshold. Once an anomaly has been identified it is critical that the metrics used \n\nto describe volcanic thermal activity are both reliable and meaningful. Over the last 30 years a \n\ngreat deal of attention has been paid to the subpixel analysis of imagery from volcanic targets. \n\nThis is because active volcanic surfaces are often thermally heterogeneous at the pixel scale. A \n\nsingle radiance or temperature value will therefore not capture the full thermal complexity of \n\nactive volcanic surfaces. \n\n I explored the ability of imaging spectrometers, such as Hyperion, to resolve subpixel \n\ncharacteristics (i.e. the number, size and temperature of isothermal subpixel components) at \n\nvolcanic targets. This was achieved by developing a method for inverse modelling of radiance \n\nspectra from which subpixel characteristics could be derived. This method was tested using a \n\nMonte Carlo approach. Radiance spectra could be accurately modelled, i.e. to within 3 - 5 %. \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nHowever, even at this level of accuracy, it was not possible to reliably resolve subpixel \n\ncharacteristics. Theoretically improved model fitting accuracy could allow for more reliable \n\nsubpixel characteristics solutions. However, in practice, this is probably not possible due to \n\nlimitations in the accuracy to which radiance spectra can be measured in the first place. Thus, it is \n\nimprobably that we can reliably determine subpixel characteristics of imagery from active \n\nvolcanoes using spectral information alone. This has profound implications given the extent to \n\nwhich previous authors have attempted to resolve such parameters over the last three decades.  \n\n We advocate an alternative solution. Radiant flux and radiant exitance are two (related) \n\nmetrics that can both be used to reliably and meaningfully describe thermal activity even from \n\nsurfaces with strong temperature gradients. We developed a method for calculating these \n\nparameters that is computationally efficient, and therefore fast, enough to be executed by \n\ncomputers on-board sensor systems for on-the-fly processing. We provide a practical example of \n\nthis approach using data from Hyperion, producing maps of radiant flux of an active lava flow at \n\nKliuchevskoi volcano. \n\n This thesis is organized in the following way. A fundamental review of scientific \n\nprincipals and context is provided in Chapter 2. This is followed by chapters that are comprised \n\nof articles that have been either published in, accepted by or about to be submitted to \n\ninternational, peer-reviewed journals. Chapter 3 explores the use of ASTER to characterize the \n\nsize and intensity of thermal anomalies at L\u00e1scar and Erebus, Chapter 4 investigates the \n\ndevelopment of a synergy between ASTER and MODIS as well as demonstrating a use of \n\nwavelet analysis on MODIS data, Chapter 5 explores the use of imaging spectrometers to \n\ncalculate radiant flux and makes the case against subpixel analysis at volcanic targets. Chapter 6 \n\nlooks to the future of infrared remote sensing of volcanoes from space and provides an overall \n\nconclusion. \n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\n \n\nScientific Context \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1. Observing Volcanoes from Space \n\n \n\nSatellites provide many advantages over field-based techniques when observing volcanic \n\nbehaviour. These include: global coverage, a synoptic perspective of a scene, continuity of data \n\ncollection, almost zero exposure of people and equipment to volcanic hazards, and typically a \n\nmuch lower cost of data acquisition for the end user.  \n\nThere are two principal orbits used by Earth observation satellites (Fig. 2.1); those that \n\ntraverse around the Earth's poles (i.e. polar orbit) and those that stay within the plane of the \n\nEarth\u2019s equator whilst completing an orbit in a 24 hour period thus point continuously towards \n\nthe same face of the Earth (i.e. geostationary).  \n\nPolar orbits have relatively low altitudes (&lt;1000 km) and are sun-synchronous (i.e. they \n\npass the equator at the same time of day and night). Within the typical altitude range of a polar \n\norbiting satellite (i.e. 550 - 850 km) the orbit period will take 99 \u00b1 4 minutes. This translates into \n\nabout 14.5 orbits per day. Polar orbiters are able to provide global coverage because of the \n\nrotation of the Earth.  \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nGeostationary satellites, on the other hand, are situated at much high altitude (i.e. 35,770 \n\nkm) in order to obtain the required 24 hour orbit period. Clearly a single geostationary satellite \n\ncannot image the Earth\u2019s entire surface. However a constellation of at least 5 satellites, separated \n\nby 60\no\n of longitude, could provide global coverage of equatorial regions (Mouginis-Mark and \n\nDomergue-Schmidt 2000). Even so such a geostationary constellation will inevitable suffer \n\nsevere distortion beyond ~50\no\n from the sub satellite point due to the curvature of the Earth and \n\nwill also be incapable of imaging the poles. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. A schematic of polar and geostationary orbits. \n\n \n\nAn imaging sensor contains an array of detector elements; this is often referred to as a \u2018focal \n\nplane array\u2019. The response from each detector element will typically correspond to a single \n\npicture element (i.e. pixel) within an image. The angular cone of visibility of each detector \n\nelement is known as its instantaneous field of view (i.e. IFOV). The area on the Earth's surface to \n\nwhich a single pixel corresponds is proportional to the IFOV of the detector element and the \n\naltitude of the satellite. This area is typically assumed to be well represented by discrete, non-\n\noverlapping rectangles, as this greatly facilitates computational processing and visualization of \n\nimage data. The size of the rectangular area on the ground to which a single pixel corresponds is \n\nthe standard way of expressing spatial resolution. The smaller the pixel size the higher the spatial \n\nresolution. In reality the IFOVs of detector elements are not rectangular and they do overlap. This \n\ncan present issues when imaging hot targets with strong thermal gradients (e.g. Chapter 5). The \n\ngeographical width of the area imaged by an entire focal plane array is known as the swath width. \n\nThis width, as well as the orbital period of a satellite, controls the temporal frequency of polar \n\norbiters (i.e. the time taken to acquire consecutive images of the same part of the Earth's surface). \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nConversely, the temporal frequency of geostationary satellites is controlled solely by their data \n\nacquisition and transfer rate, typically providing a new image of the same portion of the Earth \n\nevery 15 - 30 minutes.  \n\n Satellite sensors are often classified based on their spatial and temporal resolution. At the \n\ntime of writing images with pixel sizes smaller than somewhere between 30 to 100 m are usually \n\nconsidered to be of high spatial resolution. Revisit periods of less than one day are considered to \n\nbe high temporal resolution. Images with a pixel size of around 1 km or more are considered to \n\nbe of low spatial resolution. Revisit periods of more than a couple of weeks constitute a low \n\ntemporal resolution. Spectral capabilities are usually classified depending on whether a sensor \n\nsystem has a single, typically quite wide, waveband (panchromatic), more than one waveband \n\n(multispectral), or more than one hundred wavebands, in this case often referred to as 'channels' \n\n(hyperspectral). There exists the possibility that hyperspectral sensors will become known as \n\nimaging spectrometers. The wide variety of spatial, temporal and spectral information captured \n\nby current and past orbital sensors has been creatively adopted by the volcano monitoring \n\ncommunity over the years. The predominant themes are discussed below. \n\n \n\n2.1.1. Thermal Emission \n\n \n\nIt is possible to monitor the central driving force of volcanic activity (i.e. heat transfer) directly \n\nfrom space by measuring radiated electromagnetic energy. The first recorded observation of \n\nthermal volcanic activity from space was from the High Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HRIS) \n\non board the Nimbus 1 (Gawarecki et al. 1965). Since then there have been a number of satellites \n\nused to observe thermal emissions from volcanoes (Table 2.1). \n\n Nimbus 1 was a geostationary satellite; the HRIR sensor acquired imagery using 70mm \n\nfilm strips that were digitized for transmission back to Earth, using a facsimile scanner (i.e. an \n\napparatus that determines changes in tone density). Focal plane arrays have now superseded \n\nfacsimile imagers. Modern geostationary satellites include those in NASA's Geostationary \n\nOperational Environmental Satellite (GOES) series. The imager on GOES-8 (i.e. launched in \n\n1994) was the first in this satellite series to have a mid infrared (i.e. MIR; 3 - 5 ?m) channel. MIR \n\nwavelengths are crucial for detecting thermal anomalies at such a low spatial resolution (i.e. 4 \n\nkm). Co-registered thermal infrared (i.e. TIR; 8 - 12 ?m) imagery is often used to improve \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\ndetection capability as, given that they are insensitive to volcanic thermal phenomenon at such \n\nspatial resolutions, they can provide an indication of background conditions (e.g. Harris et al. \n\n1997). The GOES series is principally intended to provide meteorological data. The demand for \n\nreliable up-to-date weather forecasts has resulted in the construction and launch of an ever \n\nevolving constellation of meteorological satellites. ESA's Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) \n\nseries, which cover Europe and Africa, have included the Spinning Enhanced Visible and \n\nInfrared Imager (SEVIRI) since 2002. SEVIRI has a 4 and 11 ?m channel with a temporal \n\nresolution of 15 minutes and a pixel size of 3 km. The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) \n\nlaunched the first of the Multi-Functional Transport Satellite series (MTSAT) in 2005. It provides \n\ncoverage of Asia and Australasia and has 3.7 and 10.8 ?m channel with a 4 km spatial resolution. \n\nGlobal equatorial geostationary coverage is therefore a reality and appears likely to remain so for \n\nthe foreseeable future.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.1. Orbital sensors used for infrared observations of volcanoes \n\n \n\n \n\nFor truly global coverage it is necessary to use polar orbiting satellites. Large swath width polar \n\norbiters (i.e. ~3000 km) are capable of acquiring daily images at equatorial latitudes and even \n\nmore frequently towards the poles due to orbit convergence. High temporal resolution polar \n\norbiters typically have pixel sizes of around 1 km. The Advanced Very-High Resolution \n\nRadiometer (AVHRR) was the first to measure in the MIR and also freely transmits data to \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nanyone with a receiving station. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) has been using \n\nAVHRR to monitor volcanoes at the Alaskan peninsula, the Aleutian Islands and the \n\nKamchatkan peninsula since 1994. This has included the development of algorithms that \n\nautomatically detect thermal anomalies and produce up-to-date visual representations of target \n\nvolcanoes (e.g. Dean et al. 1996). The Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), launched on \n\nboard the second European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS - 2) in 1995 and de-orbited in June \n\n2011, provided similar data to that of AVHRR but with an additional 1.6 ?m channel to further \n\nconstrain spectral radiance from hot, spatially extensive targets. It was not until the launch of the \n\nModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) however, i.e. in December 1999, that \n\na truly global volcano thermal monitoring system could be developed. The first, and currently \n\nonly, of which was MODVOLC. This monitoring system automatically scans MODIS data for \n\nhotspots and, when found, records their location, time and radiant intensity. NASA Goddard \n\nSpace Flight Center sends these algorithm outputs to the University of Hawaii every 5 minutes \n\nwhich, in turn, are made available on the MODVOLC website (modis.higp.hawaii.edu). The most \n\nrecent addition to the fleet of high temporal resolution polar orbiters is the Suomi NPP\n1\n. It was \n\nsuccessfully launched on 28 October 2011. The sensor on board Suomi NPP which can be \n\nused to monitor volcanic thermal activity is the Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite \n\n(VIIRS). It provides high temporal resolution (0.5 day revisit) imagery at a pixel size of 375 - \n\n750 m.  \n\n High spatial resolution data are available from polar orbit given their proximity to the \n\nEarth. Thermal observations of volcanoes at high spatial resolution first became available with \n\nthe launch of the Landsat 4 and 5 (launched in 1982 and 1984, respectively) which contained the \n\nThematic Mapper (TM) sensor. Landsat 7, launched in 1999, also provided data from the \n\nEnhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). These sensors each provided two SWIR channels at \n\n30 m pixel resolution and a coarse TIR channel (i.e. 120 m/pixel for the TM and 60 m/pixel for \n\n                                                           \n1\n The Suomi NPP mission was originally called just 'NPP' (i.e. NPOESS Preparatory Project), where \n\n'NPOESS' was the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System. The NPOESS \n\nprogram was dissolved on 1 February 2010 into separate civilian and military components.  The civilian \n\ncomponent is now under the jurisdiction of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \n\nand has been renamed the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS). The acronym NPP has been changed \n\naccordingly; it now signifies 'National Polar-orbiting Partnership'.   \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nthe ETM+). The Landsat series have been used to investigate several volcanic phenomena, \n\nincluding: lava flows, lava lakes, volcanic domes, fumarole fields, Strombolian vents, and warm \n\ncrater lakes (e.g. Flynn et al. 2000). The launch of the ASTER sensor on the Terra satellite in \n\nDecember 1999 (i.e. the same satellite that carried the first MODIS sensor) provided an \n\nunprecedented number of high spatial resolution channels, with 6 in the SWIR and 5 in the TIR. \n\nParticular focus has been paid to utilizing the TIR bands to obtain surface temperature estimates, \n\ne.g. Ramsey &amp; Dehn (2004), Pieri &amp; Abrams (2005), Vaughan &amp; Hook (2006), Vaughan et. al. \n\n(2008), and Carter and Ramsey (2009), but also to explore the potential for subpixel analysis \n\n(Vaughan et al. 2010). \n\n Earth Observing 1 (i.e. EO-1) was also launched around the turn of the millennium (i.e. \n\nNovember 2000). It contained Hyperion, the first ever orbital imaging spectrometer. The extra \n\nspectral resolution allowed more advanced subpixel analysis to be carried out (section 2.5.). The \n\nuse of high spatial (i.e. ASTER), high temporal (i.e. MODIS) and high spectral (i.e. Hyperion) \n\nresolution satellites for monitoring thermal activity from volcanoes is the main thrust of this \n\nthesis and is discussed in more detail in the following chapters. \n\n \n\n2.1.2. Gas Plumes \n\n \n\nThe primary mechanism by which heat energy is transferred to the Earth's surface from volcanic \n\nsystems is through the movement of volatiles (i.e. predominantly water as well as some CO2). \n\nMeasuring water and CO2 fluxes from space is not trivial, largely because of their high \n\nconcentration in the atmosphere. Potential breakthroughs in CO2 detection may arise from use of \n\nthe Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) or the planned second Orbiting \n\nCarbon Observer mission (OCO-2). In contrast SO2 has a low atmospheric concentration which \n\nmakes it relatively simple to detect using diagnostic absorption features in the UV (~0.3 ?m), \n\nTIR (~8.6 ?m) and even microwave (~1469 ?m) wavelengths. Observation of SO2 plumes from \n\nspace using UV wavelengths has been ongoing since Krueger (1983) first discovered anomalies \n\nin ozone retrievals following the eruption of El Chich\u00f3n (Mexico). The Total Ozone Mapping \n\nSpectrometer (TOMS) was used in initial studies; other sensors with a pertinent UV channel for \n\nSO2 observation and/or quantification include the: Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment \n\n(GOME), GOME-2, SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\nCHartographY (SCIAMACHY), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and Ozone Mapping and \n\nProfiler Suite (OMPS) (e.g. Hooper et al. 2012). The use of the TIR absorption feature to obtain \n\nSO2 retrievals began with the High Resolution Infrared Sounder (HRIS) (Prata et al. 2003) and \n\nwas followed by uses of ASTER, MODIS, AIRS and IASI for this purpose (Prata et al. 2012). \n\nMeasurements of volcanic SO2 from space using microwave wavelengths have been \n\ndemonstrated by Read et al. (1993) using data from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). \n\nHowever the extremely low spatial resolution of this sensor (~ 30-150 km) limit its practical \n\napplicability. \n\n \n\n2.1.3. Ash Clouds \n\n \n\nExplosive eruptions can produce large quantities of fragmented pyroclastic material. Hot ash-rich \n\neruption clouds can often reach heights of 10 km or more and spread out laterally for thousands \n\nof kilometres. Satellites provide the only means of directly observing the entirety of such \n\nextensive features. Ash related hazards include respiratory problems, roof collapse and a potential \n\nfor ash deposits to remobilize as lahars (i.e. volcanic mudflows). Unfortunately societal \n\nvulnerability to volcanic ash is increasing due to the growing number of people and cargo that are \n\ntransported by air. This is because modern jet engines operate at temperatures that melt silicate-\n\nrich minerals, this can cause engine failure by the melting and solidification of ash within the \n\nturbine. The eruptions of Galunggung, Java (June 1982); Redoubt, USA (December 1989) and \n\nPinatubo, Philippines (June 1991) all resulted in severe damage to passenger jets with repair costs \n\nrunning into the millions of US dollars (Miller &amp; Casadevall 2000). Fortunately no lives were \n\nlost even though aircraft plummeted by as much as 7500 m in 16 minutes after ingesting ash and \n\nsubsequently stalling (Miller &amp; Casadevall 2000). These instances provided a strong motivation \n\nfor the identification and quantification of volcanic ash plumes using satellites. Prata (1989) \n\nshowed that a 10 and 12 ?m channel could be used to differentiate between ash clouds and \n\nwater/ice based on their brightness temperature difference. Examples of volcanic ash retrievals \n\ninclude uses of MODIS (Watson et al. 2004), AIRS (Hooper et al. 2012) and SEVIRI (Prata &amp; \n\nPrata 2012) sensors. \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\n2.1.4. Geometry \n\n \n\nThe geometry of a volcano is an extremely important control on the direction and distance \n\ntravelled by a hazardous flow (e.g. pyroclastic flow, lava flow, debris avalanche or lahar). Digital \n\nelevation models (DEM) therefore form the basis for hazardous flow models (e.g. TITAN 2D, \n\nPitman et al. 2003). The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), carried out during February \n\nof 2000, provided a DEM at spatial resolution of 30 m for all terrestrial surfaces between 56\no\n S \n\nand 60\no\n N. As of June 2009 a global DEM, created using ASTER\u2019s stereoscopic viewing \n\ncapability, was released to the public (i.e. ASTER GDEM). It also offers 30 m spatial resolution. \n\nVolcanic edifices can expand and contract in response to pressure variations from the flux \n\nof magma and volatiles in a volcanic system. Centimetre scale changes in the geometry of a \n\nvolcanic edifice can be imaged from space using synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR). \n\nThe principle behind InSAR is that phase changes in two separate synthetic aperture radar (SAR) \n\nimages, taken of the same location but at different times, provides information on the change in \n\ndistance between the satellite and the target surface. It is assumed that the scattering properties of \n\nthe ground remain fairly constant between acquisitions, thus variable snow and ice cover and/or \n\ndense vegetation can be problematic. Even so, many studies have been successfully carried out to \n\nshow quantitative observations of topographic changes that have been attributed to, for example, \n\nmagma chamber dynamics (e.g. Lu et al. 2000, Fialko &amp; Simons 2001, Pritchard &amp; Simons 2002, \n\nWicks et al. 2006), sill and dike intrusion (e.g. J\u00f3nsson et al. 1999, Fukushima et al. 2005, \n\nPedersen &amp; Sigmundsson 2006) and faulting (Amelung et al. 2000). Currently the TerraSAR-X \n\nand COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellations provide 11 and 4 day temporal resolution \n\nrespectively. ESA\u2019s Sentinel-1 satellites (i.e. launch in 2013 and 2014) will further increase the \n\nfrequency at which terrestrial SAR images are acquired.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\n2.1.5. Mapping eruptive products \n\n \n\nHigh spatial resolution polar orbiters with infrared wavebands can be used to map thermally \n\nanomalous surfaces. Landsat 4 and 5 have been used to map the distribution of cooling lava flows \n\n(e.g. Flynn et al. 1994) and locate the surface expression of active underground lava tubes (e.g. \n\nHarris et al. 1998). The TIR bands of the ASTER sensor facilitated the detection of more subtle \n\nthermal anomalies from pyroclastic flows and lava domes (e.g. Carter &amp; Ramsey 2009).  \n\n \n\n2.2. Physical Principles \n\n \n\nEnergy is an abstract quantity which seems to be constant during all physical interactions. This \n\ncharacteristic has resulted in it becoming a fundamental concept in our understanding of the \n\nobservable universe. Energy is required to make, move and change matter. All matter with a \n\ntemperature above absolute zero will radiate electromagnetic energy. This radiant energy displays \n\na wave-particle duality and is therefore modelled as both electromagnetic waves and physical \n\nparticles (i.e. photons). The energy associated with a single photon can be expressed as: \n\n \n\n   \n  \n\n \n (2.1) \n\n \n\nwhere h is Planck's constant (6.626 x 10\n?34\n\n J s), c is the speed of light in a vacuum \n\n(2.998 x 10\n8\n m s\n\n-1\n) and   is the photon wavelength in metres. The SI unit of energy is Joules. We \n\nare usually concerned with multiple photons. The total energy (Q) from a wave train or burst of \n\nradiant energy is the sum of all photon energies (qi) in that burst \n\n \n\n      \n\n \n\n   \n\n (2.2) \n\n \n\nThe rate of photon energy transfer is known as the radiant flux (?)  \n\n \n\n ?        (2.3) \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nIt is often necessary to quantify the radiant flux per unit area of a plane surface. This quantity is \n\nknown as exitance (M) when considering photons that are leaving a given area or as irradiance \n\n(E) when they are incident upon an area. \n\n \n\n            (2.4) \n\n            (2.5) \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 depicts a parallel wave train of photons leaving an area (A1) and moving towards \n\nanother area (A2) some distance away. The radiant flux leaving area A1 is an example of \n\nexitance, the radiant flux incident upon A2 is an example of irradiance. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2. Examples of exitance (M) and irradiance (E). The grey arrows depict the \n\ndirection of radiant flux (i.e. photons per second). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 displays the case in which photons propagate from a point source and then transect \n\narea A1 followed by A2. The irradiance will be greater on A1 than on A2 because the photon \n\ntrajectories are divergent.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3. Irradiance (i.e. radiant flux per unit area) will diminish with distance from a \n\npoint source due to divergence of photon trajectories. \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nThe decrease in irradiance from a point source is proportional to the inverse of the squared \n\ndistance from that source. \n\n   \n \n\n  \n (2.6) \n\n \n\nA metric that is dependent on distance would be inconvenient for many applications (e.g. \n\ncomparing field and spaceborne measurements). The concept of a solid angle is used to address \n\nthis problem. The SI unit of a solid angle is steradians (?). \n\n      \n\n ?  \n \n\n  \n (2.7) \n\n \n\nwhere A is an area on the surface of a sphere subtended by an arc, and r is the radius of the \n\nsphere. A solid angle is therefore dimensionless, i.e. (equation 2.7), and can encapsulate a range \n\nof geometries from an infinitesimally narrow beam up to a sphere (Fig. 2.4).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4. Examples of solid cone geometries \n\n \n\nThe radiant flux per unit steradian is called radiant intensity. \n\n \n\n          ? (2.8) \n\n \n\nRadiant intensity will not change with distance from the source (i.e. assuming that the photons \n\nare not absorbed, scattered or refracted by the medium through which they are propagating). This \n\nis because the divergence of photons matches the increase in the cross-sectional area of the solid \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nangle through which they are propagating (i.e. both increase as a function of distance squared \n\nfrom the source). \n\n A steradian begins at single point in space. It is therefore necessary for the source area to \n\napproximate a point relative to the geometry of the solid angle through which the photons \n\npropagate. Essentially it requires there to be negligible difference between i) the radiant intensity \n\nin the hypothetical case where all photons are emitted from the centre of the source area and ii) \n\nradiant intensity in the actual case were photons are being emitted throughout the source area. \n\nThis is what is meant by a point source.  \n\n However, although we can assume for mathematical convenience that photon trajectories \n\nstart from the centre of the source area, the size of the source area itself is still an important \n\ncontrol on the number of photons propagating into any given solid angle. If photons leave the \n\nsurface at a uniform rate then the radiant intensity is directly proportional to the size of the source \n\narea (A). \n\n \n\n \n    (2.9) \n\n \n\nRadiant intensity is also dependent on the orientation in which the photons are propagating. If \n\nexitance from the source area is isotropic (i.e. has no directional preference) then this relationship \n\nis defined by Lambert's Cosine Rule (10) \n\n \n\n           (2.10) \n\n \n\nwhere I  is the intensity at angle   from the normal and Io is intensity at the normal. A surface that \n\nfollows this law is known as a Lambertian surface. Radiant intensity from a Lambertian surface is \n\ntherefore greatest at normal (i.e. perpendicular to the surface) and diminishes as   approaches \n\n90\no\n. One way of conceptualizing why this occurs is by imagining the projection of the source area \n\ninto the direction of the solid angle (Fig. 2.5).  \n\n  \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5. The projected source area (red) will decrease in size as the orientation of the \n\nsolid angle (blue) moves away from the normal (?). \n\n \n\nThis projected source area (red line) represents the smallest area through which all photons must \n\npass. Note that photons are in fact emitted from the entire source area, even though they are \n\nmathematically treated as propagating from a point source through a solid angle (blue cone). If \n\nphotons are radiating equally in all directions then, as the projected area becomes smaller (i.e. as \n\n  increases), the number of photons entering the corresponding solid angle will also diminish. \n\nRadiant intensity is therefore directly proportional to the cosine of the orientation of the solid \n\nangle from the normal.  \n\n \n\n \n       (2.11) \n\n \n\nHowever, the brightness of a Lambertian surface will not change with viewing angle. This is \n\nbecause radiant intensity will diminish at the same rate as the perceived size of the area. In other \n\nwords, the surface will appear smaller as viewing angle from the normal (i.e.  ) increases, and the \n\nradiant intensity will also decrease as   increase, and both of these changes occur at the same rate \n\n(i.e. proportional to cos ). \n\n Therefore, if we divide radiant intensity by Acos , we will create a measure of photon \n\npropagation through time and space that is not dependent on the distance, or orientation, of the \n\nviewer from the source nor the size of the source area, as long as the point source assumption \n\nremains valid. This quantity is known simply as radiance. \n\n \n\n          ?        (2.12) \n\n \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nThe interaction between real surfaces and electromagnetic radiation is wavelength dependent. \n\nModern imagers are therefore designed to be sensitive to specific parts of the spectrum. Radiance \n\nmeasured with respect to wavelength is called spectral radiance (L ). \n\n \n\n          ?           (2.13) \n\n \n\nSpectral radiance is the fundamental metric used in the field of electromagnetic remote sensing. It \n\nis often necessary to work back from spectral radiance measurements to calculate the amount of \n\nenergy being emitted or reflected from a given source area. This might be the rate of radiant \n\nenergy transfer (i.e. radiant flux [W]) or the rate of radiant energy transfer per unit area (i.e. \n\nexitance [W/m\n2\n]). The relationship between exitance (2.4) and radiance (2.13) can be expressed \n\nas follows: \n\n \n\n          ? (2.14) \n\n \n\nThe collection of all possible photon trajectories from a flat surface will define a hemisphere \n\nabove that surface (Fig. 2.6). The integral in (2.14) must therefore be evaluated over such a \n\ngeometry. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6. The geometry of an infinitesimal area on the surface of a hemisphere \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nIt is possible to define a curved surface using infinitesimally small planar surfaces (i.e. in much \n\nthe same way that infinitesimally small straight lines can be used to define a curved line). If   is \n\nthe angle from the normal to the surface and ? is the azimuth, then ?  and ?? signify \n\ninfinitesimally narrow components of these angles, and ?A is an infinitesimally small area (Fig. \n\n2.6). This area defines an infinitesimally small solid angle. The size of ?A can be calculated using \n\ntrigonometry \n\n \n\n ?    ?     ?? (2.15) \n\n \n\nWe can therefore express solid angles in terms of actual angles, i.e. substituting (2.15) into (2.7) \n\n \n\n  ?  \n         ?\n\n  \n        ? (2.16) \n\n \n\nA hemisphere can be defined in space by integrating over the azimuth (i.e. a circle, 0 &lt;? &lt;2?) \n\nand the angular distance between the normal and the horizontal (i.e. 0 &lt;  &lt;?/2). Expressing \n\nexitance over these limits we have: \n\n \n\n                  \n\n   \n\n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n (2.17) \n\n \n\nWhich, when evaluated, gives: \n\n \n\n   ?  (2.18) \n\n \n\nThus exitance and radiance are related by a factor of ? for Lambertian surfaces. This is an \n\nextremely important relationship because it becomes possible to calculate the spectral exitance of \n\nan isothermal surface from just one spectral radiance measurement, regardless of look angle or \n\ndistance from source.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n2.3. Temperature, Emissivity and Blackbodies \n\n \n\nA blackbody is a hypothetical body that absorbs all photons incident upon it and reemits them out \n\nagain without any conversion (i.e. loss) of energy. The spectral radiant exitance from a blackbody \n\nis given by the Planck function. \n\n \n\n        \n    \n\n       \n  \n   \n\n    \n (2.19) \n\n \n\nwhere T is thermodynamic temperature in Kelvin, h is Planck's constant (6.626 \u00d7 10\n-34\n\n m\n2\n kg s\n\n-1\n), \n\nc is the speed of light in a vacuum (2.998 \u00d7 10\n8\n m s\n\n-1\n) and k is the Boltzmann constant \n\n(1.381 \u00d7 10\n-23\n\n m\n2\n kg s\n\n-2\n K\n\n-1\n).  The blackbody spectral radiance from a Lambertian surface is \n\ntherefore given by \n\n                 (2.20) \n\n \n\nThe emission of radiance from physical materials is not perfect. This results in a deviation from \n\nblackbody behaviour. Spectral radiance of real physical bodies includes a spectral emissivity (? ) \n\nterm: \n\n                   (2.21) \n\n \n\nThe temperature of a remote surface can be determined by rearranging and substituting (2.19), \n\n(2.20) and (2.21) appropriately \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n  \n\n       \n        \n\n    \n   \n\n \n(2.22) \n\n \n\nHowever, given the extensive, varied and dynamic nature of the terrestrial surface, we often do \n\nnot know spectral emissivity a priori. This results in an ill-posed problem, i.e. more unknowns \n\nthan equations, because each spectral radiance measurement will have a corresponding unknown \n\nspectral emissivity term plus some unknown temperature. There has been a significant amount of \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nwork towards resolving this so called temperature-emissivity separation problem for the case \n\nwhere both temperature and emissivity spectra are homogeneous at the subpixel level. A review \n\nof these techniques is provided by Dash et al. (2002).  \n\n Total radiant exitance is given by the integral of (2.19) with respect to wavelength (i.e. the \n\nStefan-Boltzmann law). \n\n        \n  (2.23) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. This shows that the radiant energy emitted by an \n\nisothermal blackbody surface is proportional to the 4\nth\n\n power of temperature, and that anything \n\nwith a temperature above absolute zero will radiate energy.  \n\n The wavelength at which peak radiant exitance occurs was first found by thermodynamic \n\nconsideration of electromagnetic radiation. It can also be found by determining the maxima of \n\n(2.19). It is described by Wien's displacement law, \n\n \n\n          (2.24) \n\n \n\nwhere b is 2897.9?mK. This relationship shows that the hotter the surface the shorter the \n\nwavelength will be at which peak radiation occurs. It is especially useful when attempting to find \n\na suitable part of the electromagnetic spectrum for a given application. For example, when \n\nattempting to determine the land surface temperature of ambient terrestrial environments \n\n(i.e. ~300K) one would expect peak radiation to occur around  9.7 ?m. Alternatively, an active \n\nlava surfaces at 773 K would probably display peak radiation at around 3.8 ?m. The actual peak \n\nwill depend on the spectral emissivity of the target. \n\n \n\n2.4. Atmospheric Effects \n\n \n\nRadiation that leaves the Earth's surface must pass through the atmosphere before reaching an \n\norbital sensor. Photons can be absorbed , re-emitted and scattered by gases and aerosols (i.e. the \n\nprimary constituents of the atmosphere). This interaction is wavelength dependent. The spectral \n\ntransmissivity (? ) of the atmosphere is given as: \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n    \n    \n  \n\n (2.25) \n\n \n\nwhere LTOA is spectral radiance leaving the top of the atmosphere and L  is spectral radiance \n\nleaving the Earth's surface.  \n\n The dominant effects on transmissivity are the concentration of H20, CO2 and aerosols in \n\nthe atmosphere as well as the altitude of the target surface and viewing angle of the sensor (i.e. \n\ndue to their control on the path length of photons within the atmosphere). The concentration of \n\ngas species and aerosols  in the atmosphere varies temporally and spatially, they must therefore \n\nbe accounted for when attempting to determine the amount of radiance that has left the Earth's \n\nsurface. This is typically achieved through the use of a radiance transfer code such as Moderate \n\nResolution Atmospheric Transmission (MODTRAN). An example MODTRAN transmissivity \n\nprofile from Kliuchevskoi volcano (Kamchatka) is displayed in Figure 1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure1. An example MODTRAN transmissivity profile from Kliuchevskoi volcano. The \n\nmid-latitude winter model was used for an at-NADIR sensor overpass. \n\n \n\n Remote sensing applications tend to utilize spectral regions in which the atmosphere is \n\nhighly transmissive. These so called atmospheric windows have a fundamental control on the \n\npractical importance, and therefore nomenclature, of different spectral regions. Studies of radiant \n\nenergy emitted by volcanic targets are restricted to the following spectral regions: the visible and \n\nnear infrared (VNIR; 0.4 - 1.5 ?m), the short-wave infrared (SWIR; 1.5 - 3 ?m), mid infrared \n\n(MIR; 3 - 5 ?m) and thermal infrared (TIR; 8 - 13?m). \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n The spectral radiance that leaves a target surface will contain varying amounts of emitted \n\nand reflected components. The transmitted portion of that radiance will then reach a satellite \n\ndetector, as will spectral radiance that is emitted and/or scatter by the atmosphere itself into the \n\ndirection of that sensor. The spectral radiance, R , can therefore be expressed as: \n\n \n\n                             (2.26) \n\n \n\nwhere ?  is spectral transmissivity, ?  is spectral emissivity, L( ,T) is blackbody radiation at \n\ntemperature T, ?  is spectral reflectance of the surface, R ,D is the downwelling atmospheric \n\nspectral radiance on to the surface and R ,U is the atmospheric upwelling spectral radiance. \n\n \n\n2.5. Issues with infrared monitoring of volcanoes from space \n\n \n\nIn order to be able to quantify volcanic thermal activity it is first necessary to be able to detect \n\nthermal anomalies. This can be achieved in a number of ways, all of which are dependent on \n\neither the spectral, spatial or temporal characteristics of the target (e.g. Steffke &amp; Harris 2011). \n\nThe most widely adopted approach is to use spectral information. This relies on setting a \n\nthreshold above which a single pixel radiance value, or comparative radiance value (i.e. typically \n\na band ratio), is considered to be anomalous. It has the benefit of being straight-forward and \n\ncomputationally efficient but will typically struggle to detect subtle thermal anomalies whilst \n\nmaintaining a low false alarm rate.  \n\n In order to be able to detect subtle thermal anomalies it is usually necessary to analyze a \n\npixel in terms of its spatial and/or temporal context. Perhaps the most intuitive approach is to \n\ndetermine if an area is significantly hotter than its surrounding. This is typically how a person \n\nmight manually search for a thermal anomaly in a qualitative sense. In order to quantify this \n\nspatial approach to anomaly detection it is necessary to define a background value (i.e. a \n\ntemperature or radiance value that represents the expected response from a thermally active area \n\nin the hypothetical case that it is not active). A background value in a spatial context is typically \n\nconsidered to be the average value within a background area. This area might be a single pixel or \n\ncollection of pixels. There has been little investigation into the effect that background area \n\nselection has on anomaly detection capabilities. For low spatial resolution data this area is often \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nconsidered to be very few, i.e. often just one, pixel(s) that is/are juxtaposed to the potentially \n\nanomalous pixel. An area this proximal to the potential heat source, however, could itself contain \n\nvolcanically active material. Furthermore, the effect of 'thermal blurring' (i.e. predominantly due \n\nto the point spread function of a detector element extending beyond the nominal surface area \n\nrepresented by a pixel) will also compromise the reliability that neighbouring inactive pixels \n\nrepresent the background conditions of the active pixel. For high spatial resolution data the \n\nbackground area is often defined manually on an ad hoc basis. There is therefore no guarantee of \n\nthe stability of a manually selected background value. Notably there are strong, non-volcanic \n\ntemperature gradients across volcanic edifices due to i) morphological aspect with respect to the \n\nsolar azimuth and elevation angles, ii) altitude variations and iii) heterogeneous surface \n\ncompositions. Thus the size and location of a background area might have a strong influence on \n\nthe resultant background value. \n\n Temporal methods for anomaly detection involve comparing a fixed pixel location \n\nthrough time (e.g. Tramutoli 1998, Pergola et al. 2004). This can be used to identify whether a \n\nconsistently cool area has become warmer, or indeed whether a consistently hot area has become \n\ncooler. It is somewhat more difficult to identify temporal anomalies in an area that has shown a \n\nhigh level of variability during the time period under consideration. Hybrid approaches to \n\nanomaly detection (e.g. Giglio et al. 2003, Koeppen et al. 2011) do show significant promise in \n\nbeing able to improve subtle detection capability whilst maintaining a low false alarm rate. \n\nHowever, all anomaly detection schemes will be effected by ephemeral obstructions between the \n\nline of sight of the sensor and the target area (i.e. meteorological clouds, ash plumes, gas \n\nemissions and aerosols) as these phenomena have wavelength dependent effects on transmissivity \n\nand also vary both spatial and temporally. \n\n Once a strategy for thermal anomaly detection has been selected it is usually necessary to \n\nquantify the intensity of the corresponding thermal activity. This is best achieved using metrics \n\nthat are physically meaningful (e.g. temperature). A major issue with calculating surface \n\ntemperatures from volcanic targets is that they are typically thermally heterogeneous at the pixel \n\nscale. Thus a single temperature value will not represent the continuous temperature distribution \n\nof the target. A number of techniques have been developed to attempt to resolve this so called \n\n'thermal mixing' problem. They rely on the assumption that a subpixel temperature distribution \n\ncan be modelled as a collection of isothermal components. \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\n \n\n             \n\n \n\n   \n\n (2.27) \n\n \n\nwhere Lpixel is the pixel radiance at a given wavelength, n is the number of isothermal subpixel \n\ncomponents, and fi and Li are the size and radiance of the i\nth\n\n component.  To solve for equation \n\n2.27 it is necessary to have at least as many spectral radiance measurements as there are subpixel \n\nthermal components. Initial attempts at subpixel thermal analysis were carried out using sensors \n\nthat had just two pertinent spectral channels; they therefore assumed that just two thermal \n\ncomponents were sufficient to reliably and accurately represent subpixel temperature \n\ndistributions (e.g. Dozier 1981, Rothery et al. 1988, Oppenheimer 1991). As new sensors with a \n\ngreater number of spectral channels were developed this model was extended to include three \n\nsubpixel thermal components (e.g. Flynn et al. 1993, Oppenheimer 1993). It has since been \n\nshown, however, that volcanic temperature distributions cannot be reliably described using just 2 \n\nor 3 thermal components (e.g. Oppenheimer et al. 1993a, Wright &amp; Flynn 2003). More recent \n\nattempts, which rely on model fitting of radiance spectra, have allowed the number of subpixel \n\nthermal components to be found automatically during the model fitting process (e.g. Wright &amp; \n\nFlynn 2003). Oddly they found that model solutions with just 2 or 3 thermal components \n\nprovided good spectral fits even though this was incongruent with high spatial resolution field \n\ndata. This raises the question of whether or not there is a better approach for resolving subpixel \n\ncomponents or, indeed, whether it is at all possible. \n\n Satellite sensors will inevitably exhibit a trade-off between spatial, spectral and temporal \n\nresolution. Volcanic activity, on the other hand, manifests itself across spatial and temporal scales \n\nthat vary by several orders of magnitude. A single satellite sensor will therefore only be able to \n\nmonitor a small portion of on-going volcanic activity. It is therefore necessary to use multiple \n\nsensors to observe the full range of eruptive products emitted by volcanoes. \n\n Forecasting volcanic eruptions is one of the major goals of volcanology as a whole. It is \n\nnot a straight-forward task because volcanoes are highly non-linear complex systems and often \n\ndisplay somewhat idiosyncratic behaviour. Even so, a rising magma body will often result in \n\nincreased thermal activity at the surface (e.g. new and/or hotter fumarolic emission, increased \n\nground temperature, increased crater lake temperature, the protrusion of a lava dome, etc), all of \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nwhich may precede an explosive eruption and/or flow of lava. Increased fumarolic activity was \n\nobserved before two of the most deadly eruptions in historical times, i.e. Mont Pelee, Martinique \n\n1902 with 29,000 fatalities; and Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia 1985 with 25,000 fatalities (Chr\u00e9tien \n\n&amp; Brousse 1989, Nakada 2000). Conversely, decreases in thermal activity have also been \n\nobserved to precede explosive eruptions (Oppenheimer et al. 1993b). It can therefore be \n\nchallenging to identify reliable thermal precursors. \n\n \n\n2.6. Aims of this Work \n\n \n\nThe overall aim of this work is to develop and test methods for improved global monitoring of \n\nvolcanoes from space.

W. Murphy, C.R. de Souza Filho, C. Oppenheimer \n\nPublished in the Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, 203, 48-61, 2011. \n\n \n\n3.1. Abstract \n\n \n\nMeasuring temperatures on volcanoes from space provides important constraints on the transfer \n\nof mass and heat to the Earth's surface. Time series of multispectral infrared images, acquired by \n\nthe Advanced  Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) between \n\n2000 and 2009, were inspected to investigate fluctuations in thermal anomalies at both Mount \n\nErebus (Antarctica) and L\u00e1scar volcano (Chile). Several thermal metrics were explored: i) \n\nmaximum pixel temperatures above  background, ii) the spatial extent of low, moderate and high \n\ntemperature anomalies, and iii) the spatial extent of short-wave infrared anomalies. The \n\nmaximum pixel temperature metric correlated to eruptive events at L\u00e1scar volcano yet displayed \n\nsignificant scatter at Erebus. The spatial extent of both temperature and short-wave infrared \n\nanomalies correlates well with eruptive activity at both volcanoes. \n\n Limited variation in the size of thermal anomalies was observed at Erebus throughout the \n\ntime series due to the stability of a long-lived lava lake, with the exception of a seasonal \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nexpansion in low temperature anomalies associated with localized snow-melt at the peak. This \n\nfinding has implications for the interpretation of low temperature anomalies at other volcanoes. \n\nAt least two different types of precursory signals are identified at L\u00e1scar: i) a gradual increase \n\nand ii) a dip, in the size and intensity of thermal anomalies. These thermal precursors appear to be \n\nassociated with different eruptive styles. The former precedes a relatively shallow, short lived \n\neruption; the later a prolonged eruptive period. Such thermal precursors could therefore help to \n\nconstrain not only the timing but also the style and duration of an imminent eruptive episode. \n\n \n\n3.2. Introduction \n\n \n\nVolcanoes are hazardous, non-linear systems and so require regular monitoring if timely forecasts \n\nof eruptive behaviour are to be given and if we are to improve our understanding of dynamic \n\nvolcanic processes. Ideally volcanologists would have access to information from all of the \n\nworld's subaerial volcanoes. This way a greater understanding of fundamental volcanic processes \n\ncan contribute to the expert knowledge required to deal with specific volcanoes that may be \n\nendangering communities or property. Orbital remote sensing provides the necessary perspective \n\nto fulfil such an ideal and is often the only source of information available for many remote \n\nvolcanoes.  \n\n The approach adopted in this study is to measure the temperature of active volcanoes \n\nfrom space using multispectral thermal infrared (TIR) images taken by the Advanced Spaceborne \n\nThermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), currently the only multispectral TIR \n\nsensor in orbit with moderate (<100 m) spatial resolution imagery that is available to the civilian \n\ncommunity. Previous authors have utilized the combined spatial and spectral resolution of this \n\nsensor to describe volcanic activity. Special consideration has been given to the reliability of \n\nterrestrial surface temperature estimates at these wavelengths (i.e. 8.125\u201311.65 ?m). The metrics \n\nused to quantify such observations have included the maximum pixel temperature (Ramsey and \n\nDehn, 2004; Vaughan and Hook, 2006; Carter et al. 2008), the average crater temperature \n\n(Vaughan and Hook, 2006) and the maximum pixel temperature above background (Ramsey and \n\nDehn, 2004; Pieri and Abrams, 2005; Vaughan et al. 2008; Carter et al. 2008). Although these \n\nthermal parameters were all shown to correlate with volcanic activity, they do not measure the \n\nactual size of the anomaly (Carter et al. 2008). This study aims toward developing methods for \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nmeasuring both the size and intensity of volcanic thermal anomalies. We further support the \n\ninvestigation of TIR-based thermal anomalies by comparison to ASTER's short-wave infrared \n\n(SWIR) bands. \n\n In order to explore an existing TIR-based parameter we first analyze temporal fluctuations \n\nin maximum pixel temperature above background. This parameter was selected because it is the \n\nmost widely adopted in the previous literature, accounts for non-volcanic seasonal variations in \n\ntemperature and has been shown to correlate particularly well with eruptive behaviour. We then \n\ndescribe the change in the size and intensity of thermal anomalies (both TIR- and SWIR based) \n\nthrough time at Mt. Erebus (Antarctica) and L\u00e1scar (Chile). These targets exhibit markedly \n\ndifferent styles of volcanism and are situated thousands of kilometres apart from each other, thus \n\nproviding a contrast in eruptive styles as well as demonstrating one of the advantages of the \n\nglobal perspective available from space. \n\n \n\n3.3. Study areas \n\n \n\n3.3.1. Erebus volcano \n\n \n\nErebus volcano (77\u00b032?S, 167\u00b010?E, 3794m) is an alkaline intraplate stratovolcano situated on \n\nRoss Island, Antarctica (Fig. 3.1) (Kyle et al. 1992; Oppenheimer et al. 2011). It contains one of \n\nthe few permanent, terrestrial lava lakes. The bulk composition of its phonolitic lava appears to \n\nhave remained unchanged over the last ~36 ka (Harpel et al. 2004; Esser et al. 2004; Kelly et al. \n\n2008). The lake is thought to be sustained by magma convection via a conduit leading to a \n\nreservoir at depth. The first historical sighting of the volcano was reported in 1841 (Ross, 1847), \n\nwith a lava lake having been observed in the active crater since modern observations began in \n\n1972 (Giggenbach et al. 1973). \n\n The permanent lake (referred to in the recent literature as Ray's lake) is sometimes \n\naccompanied by an ephemeral lake (at Werner's fumarole). Construction of the volcano began \n\naround 1.3 million years ago and is associated with crustal thinning and a possible mantle plume. \n\nThe arid, polar climate in which the volcano is situated suppresses cloud cover and, coupled with \n\nthe volcano's constant activity, makes Mount Erebus an excellent target for developing space-\n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nbased thermal monitoring techniques of active volcanoes (e.g. Harris et al. 1999; Davies et al. \n\n2008; Wright and Pilger, 2008; Vaughan et al. 2010) \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1. a) The location of Mount Erebus (Antarctica) and b) an ASTER VNIR image of \n\nthe volcano, taken on the 13th January 2008, with the active crater highlighted (red dashed \n\nline). \n\n \n\n3.3.2. L\u00e1scar volcano \n\n \n\nL\u00e1scar (23\u00b022?S, 67\u00b044?W, 5592 m) is a young (&lt;50 ka old; Matthews et al. 1997) compound \n\nstratocone situated in the Chilean Altiplano to the East of the Salar de Atacama (Fig. 3.2). It is \n\nbuilt from porphyritic andesites and dacites (Matthews et al. 1994). Historical activity is recorded \n\nback to 1848 (Venzke et al., 2002 -). The high and arid environment is associated with limited \n\ncloud, vegetation, snow and ice cover, thus making L\u00e1scar a very suitable terrain for geological \n\nremote sensing (de Silva and Francis, 1991). These environmental factors, coupled with L\u00e1scar's \n\npersistent degassing and frequent small-to-moderate explosive eruptions, have favoured \n\nnumerous remote sensing studies of L\u00e1scar volcano over the past quarter century (e.g. Francis \n\nand Rothery, 1987; Oppenheimer et al. 1993b; Wooster, 2001; Pavez et al. 2006). \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2. a) The location of L\u00e1scar volcano (Chile) and b) an ASTER VNIR image of the \n\nvolcano, taken on the 2nd April 2009, with the active crater highlighted (red dashed line). \n\n \n\n3.4. ASTER and data processing \n\n \n\nThe ASTER sensor, launched onboard the Terra satellite, has been acquiring multispectral \n\nimages of the Earth's surface for just over a decade. The imaging wavebands of this sensor fall \n\ninto three spectral regions: i) the visible and near-infrared (VNIR), with four channels from 0.52 \n\nto 0.86 ?m, 15 m spatial resolution and stereoscopic viewing capability, ii) the short-wave \n\ninfrared (SWIR), which has six channels from 1.6 to 2.43 ?m and 30 m spatial resolution, and iii) \n\nfive channels in the thermal infrared with 90 m spatial resolution (Yamaguchi et al. 1998). \n\nAcquisition of SWIR data ended in early 2008 due to degradation of the detector cooler system. \n\nASTER scenes are available at various processing levels, including raw at-sensor radiance values \n\n(L1A) as well as geometrically and radiometrically corrected sensor radiance values (L1B), \n\nwhich can be used to derive level 2 data products, such as atmospherically corrected surface \n\nradiance or surface temperature and emissivity.  \n\n This study uses the TIR at-surface radiance data product (AST_09T). These scenes were \n\nvisually scrutinized for the presence of clouds and discarded if cloud formations were situated \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nover the volcano. The images were then converted into land surface temperatures using the \n\nNormalized Emissivity Method (NEM) (Realmuto, 1990) using a maximum emissivity value of \n\n0.97. The resulting surface temperature estimates are dependent, among other factors, on seasonal \n\nand diurnal cycles as well as potential volcanic activity. To suppress non-volcanic variations \n\nthrough time we first calculate the background temperature, BTk, as follows: \n\n \n\n       (3.1) \n\n  \n\nwhere Ti, k is a pixel temperature and n is the number of pixels in the background area ?k for the \n\ni\nth\n\n pixel in the k\nth\n\n scene. The background temperature is therefore the average temperature of \n\npixels within the background area. A temperature above background, ?T, is found by subtracting \n\nthe background temperature from a given pixel: \n\n \n\n         (3.2)  \n\n \n\nPixels close to background temperature will have low ?T values while volcanically heated pixels \n\nwill be represented by positive ?T anomalies. \n\n \n\n3.4.1. Background areas \n\n \n\nAs stipulated in Eq.(3.1) a background area is required to calculate a background temperature. \n\nLand surface temperatures are not homogenous. Therefore the size, shape and location of the \n\nbackground area will affect the background temperature. In previous studies these areas have \n\nranged in size and location from a  few pixels that are juxtaposed to anomalous regions, to 50\u00d750 \n\npixel arrays situated on neighbouring topographic peaks (e.g. Ramsey and Dehn, 2004; Pieri and \n\nAbrams, 2005; Carter et al. 2008; Vaughan et al. 2010). To demonstrate the potential sensitivity \n\nof background temperatures to the location of the background area we defined a square-shaped \n\nsample area (10 \u00d7 10 pixels) and moved it through 16 different, non-overlapping locations around \n\nthe centre of volcanic activity (Fig. 3.3). A background temperature was calculated for 16 such \n\nfootprints for each scene. We then repeated this procedure for all scenes in the data set. \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n With the exception of gas/aerosol plumes, reported volcanic activity is constrained within \n\nthe active crater at both volcanoes. The sample areas are always situated at least 15 pixels (i.e. \n\n1.35 km) beyond the crater centre. Inspection of temperature images reveals that the plumes have \n\nnegligible thermal influence at such distances. In the presence of significant SO2 in the plume the \n\nNEM algorithm is still capable of producing reliable temperature retrievals due to automatic \n\nselection of the most appropriate band (e.g. in this case either ASTER band 13 or 14, both of \n\nwhich avoid SO2 absorption features). The background temperatures recorded by each of the \n\nfootprints can therefore be considered as non-volcanic. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3. The box-shaped areas used to sample background temperatures at both a) \n\nErebus and b) L\u00e1scar. The boxes are 10 pixels (i.e. 900 m) in length. North is up in both \n\nimages. \n\n \n\n The range (i.e. absolute difference between minimum and maximum) of background \n\ntemperatures for the 16 grids was calculated on a scene by scene basis and plotted for a) Erebus \n\nand b) L\u00e1scar throughout the 2000\u20132009 time series (Fig. 3.4).  \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4. The range in box sample temperatures at a) Erebus and b) L\u00e1scar. Red squares \n\nand black crosses symbolize daytime and nighttime scenes, respectively. \n\n \n\nThis provides an indication of the sensitivity of a background temperature to the location of the \n\nbackground area. Nighttime scenes (black crosses - Fig. 3.4) tend to display a limited range in \n\nsample temperatures (i.e. means of 6.7 \u00b0C at Erebus and 4.7 \u00b0C at L\u00e1scar). This indicates that \n\nthey are less sensitive to the location of the background area than the daytime scenes (red squares \n\n- Fig. 3.4) which have mean ranges of 12.2 \u00b0C at Erebus and 26.3 \u00b0C at L\u00e1scar. The maximum \n\nrange in background temperatures is 18.9 \u00b0C at Erebus and 34.0 \u00b0C at L\u00e1scar. Hence there is a \n\nsignificant dependence of the background temperature on the location of the background area at \n\nboth volcanoes, especially during the daytime. We interpreted this dependence as being \n\npredominantly due to preferential solar heating arising from variations in slope, aspect and solar \n\nazimuth at the time of image acquisition.  \n\n The sensitivity to diurnal effects as a result of slope aspect can be mitigated by defining \n\nthe background area as an annulus around the active crater (as opposed to the square regions \n\ndisplayed in Fig. 3.3). Such a background will act to balance out topographically driven thermal \n\nheterogeneities and therefore stabilize background temperature estimates, even during the day. To \n\ndefine a ring-shaped area it is necessary to assign appropriate values for the inner and outer \n\nradius. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n3.4.2. Radius pairs \n\n \n\nTo determine which inner and outer radius pair is most appropriate, sample temperatures were \n\ncalculated for the area defined by all possible combinations of radius pairs that obey the \n\nfollowing two criteria i) the inner radius may vary between 0 and 39 pixels, and ii) the outer \n\nradius may vary between 1 and 40 pixels but must be larger than the inner radius. This produces a \n\ntotal of 820 separate ring sample temperatures for each scene  \n\n To select the optimum radius pairs we impose two constraints. The first is based on the \n\nassumption that a radial profile of temperatures will tend to decrease monotonically toward the \n\nactive crater due to topographic effects up until the point at which that profile passes through a \n\nvolcanically heated area. The coldest ring temperature will therefore provide the best estimate of \n\nthe non-volcanic (i.e. background) temperature in the active crater. The second constraint is that \n\nthe total area of the background ring should be sufficiently large to smooth out unrepresentative \n\npixel temperatures (e.g. due to the  presence of undetected clouds and/or volcanic products, etc.). \n\nWe define \u2018sufficiently large\u2019 as an area of  at least 400 pixels based on the suggested size of a \n\nstandardized array given by Vaughan et al. (2010). The  background temperatures are not \n\nsensitive to this minimum size constraint, as shown below.  \n\n To validate the first constraint we calculated ring sample background temperatures for \n\nneighbouring, inactive volcanic peaks (i.e. Aguas Calientes for L\u00e1scar and Mount Bird for \n\nErebus). The deviation of each ring sample from the minimum ring sample was then calculated \n\non a scene by scene basis to locate the coldest annular regions and to facilitate comparisons \n\nthrough time. The average deviation of ring samples from minimum was then calculated for all \n\nscenes in order to provide a metric that indicates by how much a given radius pair will tend to \n\ndeviate from the coldest sample temperature (Fig. 3.5). \n\n As expected, ring temperatures tend to be coldest at the top of these peaks (i.e. low radii \n\nvalues) and to warm up progressively down slope (i.e. warmer temperatures correspond to higher \n\nradii values). Aguas Calientes displays greater thermal contrast on average between minimum \n\nand maximum ring temperatures at this scale (i.e. average range of ~9 \u00b0C at Aguas Calientes and \n\n~6 \u00b0C at Mount Bird). This is presumably due to the more pronounced relief at Aguas Calientes \n\nas well as the stronger thermal heterogeneity in daytime land surface temperatures on the \n\nAltiplano in comparison to Ross Island. \n\n \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.5. Average deviation of ring sample temperatures from the minimum ring sample \n\ntemperature for neighbouring, non-active topographic peaks at a) Mt. Bird (Antarctica) \n\nand b) Aguas Calientes (Chile). \n\n \n\n Volcanic heating can clearly perturb a temperature gradient, with the active region \n\nbecoming significantly warmer than the surrounding area. The average deviation of ring sample \n\ntemperatures from minimum is calculated for a) Erebus and b) L\u00e1scar (Fig. 3.6.).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6. Average deviation of ring sample temperatures from the minimum for a) \n\nErebus and b) L\u00e1scar volcano. Optimum radius pairs are highlighted with a white square \n\noutline. \n\n \n\n\n\n45 \n \n\nAreas close to the active crater (i.e. low radii values) tend to be relatively hot. The coolest regions \n\nare situated fairly close to the active peak (i.e. the blue-black arc shaped region). Regions that are \n\nfurther out still (i.e. high radii values) tend to be relatively warm as they are situated at lower \n\naltitude. The optimum radius pairs (i.e. coldest average ring which is at least 400 pixels in size) \n\nhave inner and outer radii of i) 10 and 15 pixels at Erebus, and ii) 8 and 14 pixels at L\u00e1scar. They \n\nare highlighted using a white square outline in Fig. 3.6. These optimum background areas are \n\ndisplayed for both a) Erebus and b) L\u00e1scar in Fig. 3.7. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7. The size and location of optimum ring-shaped background areas at both a) \n\nErebus and b) L\u00e1scar. North is up in both images. \n\n \n\n Comparison between the optimum ring temperatures and the minimum ring temperatures \n\non a scene by scene basis reveals that their average difference is 0.29\u00b10.25 \u00b0C at Erebus and \n\n0.68\u00b11.0 \u00b0C at L\u00e1scar. The optimum background temperatures are therefore generally insensitive \n\nto the minimum size constraint. Even so the implementation of this constraint will yield a more \n\nreliable background temperature estimate. Furthermore, the fact that background areas are \n\nallowed to adapt to each volcano represents a crucial step toward facilitating the use of this \n\ntechnique on a global basis. \n\n \n\n\n\n46 \n \n\n3.4.3. Background temperatures \n\n \n\nHaving defined the optimum size, shape and location of a background area it is possible to \n\ncalculate the background temperature for a given scene (i.e. Eq.(1)). The background temperature \n\nis calculated for all scenes at both a) Erebus and b) L\u00e1scar (Fig. 3.8).  \n\n Comparison of background temperatures highlights climatic differences at both \n\nvolcanoes. The background temperatures tend to be significantly colder at Erebus (Fig. 3.8a) then \n\nat L\u00e1scar (Fig. 3.8b), ranging from approximately ?50 to ?20 \u00b0C at the former and ?15 to 35 \u00b0C \n\nat the latter. However, the disparity between daytime and nighttime temperatures is more \n\npronounced at L\u00e1scar. This is due to the fact that the volcano is situated at subtropical latitudes \n\non a desert Altiplano, while Erebus is situated at polar latitudes and spends the majority of the \n\nyear in either continuous darkness or continuous light, with a 24 hour diurnal cycle only \n\noccurring during the Austral spring and autumn. A recent independent field measure taken from \n\nwithin the active crater on the 13th December 2005 (Vaughan et al. 2010) found a background \n\ntemperature value (i.e. -15.8 \u00b0C) that is comparable to our concurrent value of ?19.0 \u00b0C measured \n\nfrom space.  \n\n The ASTER sensor is in a sun-synchronous orbit therefore images of a given point on the \n\nEarth's surface are acquired within a fixed time window for ascending and descending orbits. \n\nImage acquisitions of Erebus occur at either 14:05 +/-30 or 20:32 +/-20 UTC, while images of \n\nL\u00e1scar are acquired at either 14:51 +/-10 or 03:20 +/-10 UTC. The benefit of taking images at the \n\nsame time of day or night is that diurnal variations in temperature are suppressed. Meteorological \n\neffects have also been minimized by screening out cloudy scenes. Seasonal effects are therefore \n\nthe major influence on background temperatures in these time series. A reasonable model of this \n\neffect can be achieved through the use of a sinusoidal function (Eq. 3.3). \n\n \n\n        (3.3) \n\n \n\nwhere BT* is the modelled background temperature, a, is the amplitude of seasonal temperature \n\nfluctuations, ? is angular frequency (i.e. 2? per year), t is time, ? is the phase (i.e. onset of the \n\nseasons) and c is the point about which the function oscillates (i.e. approximately the average \n\ntemperature of the time series). The model is justifiable because seasonal effects are \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\npredominantly controlled by a stable cyclic motion (i.e. the Earth revolving around the sun), that \n\ndoes not show significant perturbation over this timeframe.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8. The background temperatures of a) Erebus and b) L\u00e1scar volcanoes from 2000 \n\nto 2009. Red squares and black crosses denote daytime and nighttime images, respectively. \n\nError bars are one standard deviation. \n\n \n\n Daytime and nighttime temperatures are modelled separately for L\u00e1scar although such a \n\ndistinction is not made at Erebus as polar diurnal and seasonal cycles are somewhat \n\nsynchronized. Models are fit using least-squares regression. The mean absolute error from the \n\nmodel is less than 4.5 \u00b0C for all data sets (Table 3.1). L\u00e1scar daytime scenes display the largest \n\nBT* amplitude, indicating that they are the most susceptible to seasonal variations. The best fit is \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\nprovided by L\u00e1scar night-time series. However, we observe that while L\u00e1scar day and night \n\nscenes should be in phase they are ~100 days apart. We attribute this discrepancy to the limited \n\nnumber of daytime scenes in this data set and correspondingly poorer constraint of the daytime \n\nmodel. \n\n \n\nTable 3.1. The least-squares best fit of sinusoidal model parameters on background \n\ntemperatures. Mean and maximum absolute errors are also provided. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5. Anomalous volcanic temperatures \n\n \n\nAlthough the ASTER sensor is particularly well suited to calculating terrestrial temperatures, \n\nexisting metrics that describe volcanic temperatures estimates from space are limited in the sense \n\nthat they do not identify all anomalous pixels. Instead they measure either the single hottest pixel \n\ntemperature (e.g. Ramsey and Dehn, 2004; Pieri and Abrams, 2005; Vaughan and Hook, 2006; \n\nCarter et al. 2008; Vaughan et al. 2008), which may undergo a sub-pixel component analysis (e.g. \n\nPieri and Abrams, 2005 and Hirn et al. 2008), or they measure a crater-averaged temperature \n\n(Vaughan and Hook, 2006). The maximum temperature above background has arguably proved \n\nthe most insightful metric so far. It has been used to detect new high temperature features, such as \n\nfumaroles and lava domes (e.g. Ramsey and Dehn, 2004; Vaughan et al. 2008) as well as to \n\ndescribe cooler materials such as pyroclastic flow deposits and lahar deposits (e.g. Ramsey and \n\nDehn, 2004; Carter et al. 2008). As mentioned previously, however, a significant drawback of \n\nmeasuring just the maximum pixel temperature is that it does not provide any spatial information \n\nregarding anomalies (Carter et al. 2008). For example, the same maximum temperature value \n\ncould correspond to a small isolated anomaly on one date and a larger widespread anomaly on \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nanother. We propose that an improved measure of volcanic activity would account for all \n\nanomalous pixels. To create such a metric it is necessary first to define an appropriate threshold \n\nfor thermally anomalous pixels. \n\n \n\n3.5.1. Anomalously hot pixels \n\n \n\nFor a pixel to be considered anomalously hot it must exceed the background temperature by a \n\nsignificant amount. Such a threshold can be determined by calculating the natural variability of \n\n?Ts within a dataset and then defining a statistical limit above which background ?Ts are not \n\nexpected to exceed. To achieve such a goal it is necessary to convert individual ?Ts into a \n\nmeasure of variability. We use z-scores, zi, k, for this purpose, given by: \n\n \n\n         (3.4) \n\n \n\nwhere ?Ti, k is a pixel temperature above background and ?k the standard deviation of the \n\nbackground temperature, and subscripts denote i\nth\n\n pixels in k\nth\n\n scenes. A z-score is therefore a \n\nnormalized measure of deviation from the background temperature. The background (i.e. mean) \n\ntemperature is represented by a z-score of zero. A pixel temperature that is one standard deviation \n\nabove or below this mean will have a z-score of 1 or ?1, respectively.  \n\n A frequency distribution (i.e. histogram) of z-scores can be converted into a probability \n\ndensity function (PDF) by normalizing appropriately. We determine a PDF of z-scores for all \n\nscenes at A) Erebus and B) L\u00e1scar that were acquired by i) day and ii) night (Fig. 3.9). These \n\nPDFs represent the expected deviation of background pixels from the background temperature in \n\nunits of standard deviations.  \n\n Daytime distributions are somewhat bimodal, this is presumably due to the amalgamation \n\nof two principal temperature distributions which correspond to i) surfaces on the volcanic edifice \n\nthat are more exposed to solar radiation and ii) surfaces that are in shadow. Nighttime \n\ndistributions are unimodal at both volcanoes and quite strongly asymmetric at L\u00e1scar, with the \n\nmode (i.e. peak probability) occurring distinctly above the mean. This may be due to more \n\nefficient heat loss from relatively warm areas, which consequently bunches together pixel \n\ntemperatures that are above the mean.  \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9. Probability density functions of background z-scores at a) Erebus, v) L\u00e1scar \n\nduring i) the day and ii) the night, calculated using all scenes in each dataset. \n\n \n\n We can see from these PDFs that the vast majority of pixel temperatures will not exceed \n\nthe background temperature by more than two standard deviations. In particular, 99% of z-scores \n\nare below two at L\u00e1scar (during the day or night) as well as for the Erebus night time series, \n\nwhile 98% of scenes have z-scores below two for the Erebus daytime series. \n\n An anomaly could be defined on a scene by scene basis by using a given z-score \n\nthreshold. However, as variations in background temperatures are seasonally dependent, it \n\nfollows that such a measure of anomaly would also be seasonally dependent. To introduce a more \n\nconsistent measure of thermal anomaly through time we select the maximum standard deviation \n\nof background temperatures within a time series, ?max, and use twice its value as a threshold. A \n\npixel is therefore considered to be anomalous if it satisfies the condition outlined in equation 3.5. \n\n \n\n         (3.5) \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nThis provides a fixed criterion for detecting anomalies in a given time series and a very low false \n\nalarm rate. The maximum standard deviation of background temperatures at Erebus and L\u00e1scar \n\nare 4.9 and 11.7 \u00b0C during the day and 2.4 and 3.6 \u00b0C during the night, respectively. \n\nTemperatures above background would therefore be considered as anomalously hot if they \n\nexceeded 9.8 \u00b0C or 23.4 \u00b0C for daytime series, and 4.8 \u00b0C or 7.2 \u00b0C for nighttime series at Erebus \n\nand L\u00e1scar, respectively. We note that variability in daytime temperatures hinders subtle thermal \n\nanomaly detection. Nonetheless, the metric proposed here accounts for the natural fluctuation \n\nwithin a dataset and describes a statistical limit beyond which we identify volcanogenic heating. \n\n \n\n3.5.2. The spatial extent of thermal anomalies \n\n \n\nGiven this quantification of \u2018anomalously hot\u2019 pixels it is possible to determine the overall size of \n\nanomalous areas by simply counting the relevant pixels. In order to focus on local volcanic \n\neffects the target area for such an anomaly search was defined as the circular region within the \n\nbackground area. The frequency distributions of anomalous temperatures can also be obtained by \n\nbinning pixels into given temperature ranges. This discriminates, for example, large cool areas \n\nfrom small hot areas, thus facilitating the interpretation of thermal anomalies. Here, we classify \n\nthree anomaly classes as follows: i) cool (?T &lt;30 \u00b0C), ii) moderate (30 &lt;?T &lt;60 \u00b0C) and iii) \n\nhot (?T > 60 \u00b0C). We avoid defining a larger number of narrower thermal regions at present \n\ngiven that it may not be appropriate at this spatial resolution. \n\n \n\n3.5.3. SWIR anomalies \n\n \n\nNighttime short-wave infrared anomalies are also calculated using an analogous background \n\nvalue and standard deviation threshold, although in this case to differentiate from sensor noise as \n\nopposed to seasonal or diurnal affects. We did not analyze daytime SWIR images as solar \n\nirradiation tends to significantly hinder anomaly detection at these wavelengths. It is important to \n\nnote that saturation occurs frequently in the SWIR wavebands over these targets (i.e. in 84% of \n\nErebus scenes and 48% of L\u00e1scar scenes). This arises because the upwelling radiation reaching \n\nthe satellite sensors often exceeds the dynamic ranges of the various ASTER SWIR detectors and \n\ntherefore limits the extent to which the SWIR channels can be used for quantitative \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\nmeasurements. As such we limit classification of pixels within SWIR scenes to the binary case of \n\nbeing either anomalous or not anomalous. \n\n \n\n3.6. Results \n\n \n\n3.6.1.

The Erebus time series (Fig. 3.10a) reveals considerable scatter in both daytime and \n\nnighttime scenes and no clear secular trends. On the other hand, L\u00e1scar displays a more coherent \n\ntemporal pattern (Fig. 3.10b) which appears to show pronounced changes in intensity with \n\nrespect to most of the reported erupted episodes at L\u00e1scar (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism \n\nNetwork. L\u00e1scar. 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007). The reported mid-points of these \n\nepisodes are highlighted as triangles in Fig. 3.10b.  \n\nThe scatter at Erebus appears to be incongruent with the limited variation in thermal \n\noutput from the lava lake that has been observed using both long term orbital data (Wright and \n\nPilger, 2008) and field thermography (Calkins et al. 2008; Oppenheimer et al. 2009). There are \n\nseveral potential contributing factors to this scatter. One such influence is the dependence of pixel \n\ntemperatures on the fractional area of the lake within a given pixel. The size of the lake during \n\nthis time period varied between ~700 and 1400 m\n2\n (Csatho et al. 2008; Calkins et al. 2008) while \n\neach ASTER TIR pixels corresponds to an area of ~8100 m\n2\n. The lake may therefore \u2018fit\u2019 \n\ncompletely within a single pixel or be divided between up to four pixels. The number of pixels \n\nwithin which the lava lake is imaged will influence the maximum temperature of a given scene. \n\nThis dependency is modelled below (see Discussion) using a 3-component model of the lava lake \n\nsystem, with hot cracks, crust and non-volcanic background, to demonstrate that maximum pixel \n\ntemperatures vary significantly as a function of the maximum proportion of the lava lake within a \n\ngiven pixel.  \n\n Other factors that may also create scatter in maximum pixel temperatures at Erebus \n\ninclude i) the concentration, composition and location of aerosols and gas plumes, ii) short time \n\nscale variations in radiative output from the lake due to pulsatory magma supply and gas \n\nemission, iii) the amount and temperature of spatter around the lake, iv) the disposition of other \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nthermal anomalies within the Erebus crater (e.g. the ephemeral \u2018Werner\u2019 lava lake), v) the \n\nbackground temperature itself in the case that pixel saturation occurs, vi) meteorological effects; \n\nof which air temperature, relative humidity and wind speed might have an important control on \n\nthe development of fumes, and vii) the viewing geometry; which is dependent on the nadir angle \n\nof the sensor at the time of acquisition (i.e. nadir varies between +/?8.6 in both data sets), the \n\nposition of the anomaly within the swath and the topography of the target area. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10. Maximum temperatures above background for a) Erebus and b) L\u00e1scar. Red \n\nsquares and black crosses denote daytime and nighttime images, respectively. The midpoint \n\nof eruptive episodes is denoted using a triangle symbol. \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\n The maximum temperature series at L\u00e1scar displays a significant contrast in style. \n\nTemporal trends are discernible and appear associated with eruptive events. These trends include \n\na) two eruptive precursors, namely i) a gradual increase before the 2002 eruption and ii) a gradual \n\ndecrease followed by an increase before the 2006 eruption, b) syn-eruptive increases during the \n\n2000 and 2006 eruptions as well as c) post-eruptive changes, with a brief increase after the 2003 \n\neruption and sustained decrease after the 2006 eruption.  \n\n The onset of the first eruption in the L\u00e1scar time series occurs within 7 months of the \n\nlaunch of the ASTER sensor. Trends preceding this eruption are therefore unclear. However \n\nmaximum temperatures  are higher during the eruptive episode relative to pre-eruptive values. \n\nFew data were available for 2001, with only one suitable cloud-free scene available for that year. \n\nWe thus have no data bearing on the eruptive episode reported to have occurred between 4\nth\n\n May \n\nand 6\nth\n\n July 2001 (Venzke et al. 2002 -).  \n\n The October 2002 eruptive episode consisted of several small explosions that produced \n\nash plumes ranging in height from 300 to1500 m above the crater rim (Bulletin of the Global \n\nVolcanism Network. L\u00e1scar. 2003). This episode was preceded by a progressive increase in \n\nmaximum pixel temperatures above background (Fig. 3.10b). Lava dome growth and destruction \n\nhave been associated with a number of L\u00e1scar's past eruptions but no dome was observed in the \n\nactive crater throughout 2000 - 2002 (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network. L\u00e1scar. 2003). \n\nThe increase in thermal output apparent from the ASTER time series is therefore likely to \n\nrepresent an increase in the temperature and/or flux of  gas emission. Increases in fumarolic \n\nactivity have also been observed before explosive eruptions at other stratovolcanoes (e.g. July \n\n1985 at Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia [Scientific Event Alert Network. Nevado del Ruiz. 1985], \n\nJuly 1995 at Soufri\u00e8re Hills, Montserrat [Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network. Soufri\u00e8re \n\nHills. 1995], and May 2010 at Bezymianny, Kamchatka [Smithsonian Institute. Bezymianny \n\nWeekly Reports. May, 2010]).  \n\n Following the October 2002 eruption the active crater collapsed by several tens of meters, \n\nproducing a deep, steep depression roughly 200 m in diameter and 200 m deep (Bulletin of  the \n\nGlobal Volcanism Network. L\u00e1scar. 2003). Fumarolic activity continued after this time and was  \n\npunctuated by the occurrence of a 400 m high, grey coloured plume in December 2003 (Bulletin \n\nof the Global Volcanism Network. L\u00e1scar. 2004). No thermal precursors are apparent before this \n\neruption. The brief peak in maximum temperatures after the event perhaps indicates that a \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\ntemporary, post-eruptive increase in fumarolic activity occurred. Such an increase could be the \n\nresult of decompression of magma remaining in the upper conduit following the expulsion of \n\nmagma during the eruption, facilitating both the exsolution and transport of volatiles to the \n\nsurface. Alternatively it may indicate that an active lava dome  was exposed at the surface at that \n\ntime.  \n\n Local residents (15\u201360 km from the volcano) did not report any earthquakes or explosions \n\nin relation to a Vulcanian eruption of May 2005. Nor do we observe any significant changes in \n\nmaximum temperatures above background before, during or after this event. Nevertheless, an ash \n\ncloud was observed in AVHRR imagery and very fine ash fall was also reported in Salta \n\n(Argentina) ~285 km SSE (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network. L\u00e1scar. 2005).  \n\n Field observations of the active crater in December 2005 (i.e. after the May 2005 \n\neruption) revealed that the crater floor was no longer visible from the accessible (i.e. Southern) \n\nside of the crater rim, indicating that further subsidence had occurred (Bulletin of the Global \n\nVolcanism Network. L\u00e1scar. 2006). Maximum temperatures show a gradual decrease throughout \n\nthis time (i.e. from May to December 2005) and may be related to crater collapse and an overall \n\nreduction in permeability in the upper conduit. Mechanisms for such permeability reduction \n\ninclude: i) bubble collapse of a foamy lava, ii) precipitation of hydrothermal minerals, iii) \n\nwelding and fusion of the conduit walls, and iv) increases in the dynamic viscosity and strength \n\nof magma by cooling, degassing and crystallization (Matthews et al. 1997). This trend is \n\nanalogous to the behaviour described for the 1993 eruptive style (Oppenheimer et al. 1993b), at \n\nwhich time decreases in conduit permeability and therefore fumarolic activity (as inferred from \n\ndecreases in radiant flux measured by Landsat infrared bands) were shown to precede eruptive \n\nevents. We note that it is possible that the collapse of the crater may also act to obscure some of \n\nthe radiance emitted by the volcano from reaching the sensor in off-nadir scenes.  \n\n Here we also observe, for the first time, an increase in maximum temperatures (i.e. \n\n~January to April 2006) following a gradual decrease as described above. It is not clear whether \n\nthis represents a sudden increase in permeability, the emplacement of a lava dome or perhaps \n\neven an unreported eruption.  Maximum temperatures above background remain elevated \n\nthroughout the April 2006 - July 2007 eruptive period. This could reflect a period of elevated \n\nstrong fumarolic activity or possibly effusion of a lava dome. No lava dome was observed during \n\nfieldwork at the active crater carried out by one of us (S. Murphy) on 10 December 2009 \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n(Fig. 3.11), though the crater floor was still not visible from the Southern rim of the volcano at \n\nthat time.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11. The collapsed active crater of L\u00e1scar volcano as seen from the Southern rim on \n\nthe 10\nth\n\n December 2009. A lava dome is not visible, however, neither is the crater floor due \n\nto local topographic relief. \n\n \n\n After this final eruptive period (i.e. July 2007 onwards) maximum temperatures above \n\nbackground remained consistently low, with anomalies only being detected at night. A small \n\nincrease in these maximum temperatures can be seen throughout the remainder of 2007. \n\nFollowing this a gradual decrease in maximum temperatures is observed until the end of the time \n\nseries (i.e. 18\nth\n\n April 2009). We infer that fumarolic intensity was relatively low at this time, \n\nperhaps reflecting waning degassing of residual magma in the conduit.  \n\n \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\n3.6.2. The spatial extent of thermal anomalies  \n\n \n\nThe spatial extents of thermally anomalous regions for both a) Erebus and b) L\u00e1scar are displayed \n\nin Figure 3.12. A separate scatter plot is used to display the size of i) low, ii) moderate and iii) \n\nhigh temperature anomalies, as well as iv) SWIR anomalies. Note the distinction between \n\ndaytime and nighttime scenes. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12. The size of thermal anomalies at a) Erebus and b) L\u00e1scar volcano. Distinction \n\nis made between i) low, ii) moderate and iii) high temperature anomalies, as well as iv) a \n\nSWIR anomaly series (interrupted in 2008 due to the ASTERSWIR system failure). Note \n\nthat temperature and  SWIR pixel sizes are not the same (i.e. 90 and 30 m, respectively). \n\nRed squares and black crosses denote daytime and nighttime images, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n3.6.2.1. Erebus \n\n \n\nLow temperature anomalies at Erebus (Fig. 3.12a i) display a strong dependence on solar \n\nirradiation with peaks occurring during daylight hours. Comparison with VNIR scenes indicates \n\nthat these low temperature anomalies often coincide with bare rock around the Erebus crater and \n\nto Sun facing rocks beyond the caldera edge. Ideally the background area would represent all the \n\ninactive surfaces in the target area (i.e. both snow and rock in this case). However, simply \n\nincorporating the exposed rocks around the crater rim into the background area is likely to \n\nproduce unreliable background temperatures given that fumarolic activity up the inner crater \n\nwalls and/or the presence of plumes can thermally contaminate such proximal regions. We do not \n\nattempt to fine tune the background selection methodology here but rather emphasize the caution \n\nrequired in interpretation of thermal anomalies and the value of comparing the anomaly maps \n\nwith the original reflectance datasets.  \n\n While the low temperature anomaly class is stable at night, the size of moderate and high \n\ntemperature anomalies (Fig. 3.12a ii and iii) is stable regardless of the solar elevation angle. A \n\nnotably large moderate temperature anomaly occurs on 27\nth\n\n January 2001. The image acquired at \n\nthis time includes the full suite of ASTER sensor bands (Fig. 3.13) in which a) a thick plume, \n\n~500m in diameter, is visible in the VNIR, b) a second thermal feature, probably Werner's \n\nfumarole, is discernible in the SWIR bands, and c) a fairly large (i.e. 16 pixel) moderate \n\ntemperature anomaly and a wide-spread, low temperature anomaly are present; the former \n\nappears to be associated with the plume and the later to exposed rock surfaces.  \n\n The SWIR anomalies, as a whole, support evidence for a consistent high temperature \n\nsource. The size of these anomalies typically vary around 10 - 20 SWIR pixels, i.e. 9000 - 18,000 \n\nm\n2\n (Fig. 3.12a iv). This is larger than the known area of the lava lake by a factor of ~10 and \n\nlikely results from the disparity between the lava lake signal and the immediate crater \n\nsurroundings. To illustrate this point, imagine an isothermal lava crust at 500 \u00b0C and a \n\nsurrounding area at 0 \u00b0C. If both radiate as blackbodies then the crust will emit 3.4\u00d710\n2\n W m\n\n-2\n sr\n\n-\n\n1\n ?m\n\n-1\n of  spectral radiance at 2 ?m while the ground would emit only 1.4\u00d710\n\n-5 \nW m\n\n-\n2\n\n \nsr\n\n-1\n ?m\n\n-1\n at \n\nthis wavelength, i.e. a difference of seven orders of magnitude. Scattering (enhanced by the gas \n\nand aerosol plume) of just a small fraction (e.g. 1%) of the lava lake radiation into the \n\ninstantaneous field of view (IFOV) of adjacent detector elements would increase the size of the \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\nanomaly such that it does not accurately map to the feature's true dimensions. Another factor that \n\nblurs SWIR anomalies is the relationship between the IFOV and detector resampling frequency. \n\nPixels do not map perfectly to areas on the ground from which the radiation was sensed but rather \n\ncorrespond to upwelling radiation received from a wider solid angle defined by the detector's \n\npoint spread function. Furthermore it is also possible that some hysteresis effects occur as the \n\nsensor scans over very hot targets. These factors combine to significantly smear out of the signal \n\nof high temperature features such as lava lakes. They may also contribute to increasing the \n\nvariability in the size of SWIR anomalies through time. Other factors that may increase this \n\nvariability include those mentioned previously as influences on maximum pixel temperatures \n\n(Section 5.1) as well as intermittent activity at Werner's fumarole (which is occasionally \n\nincandescent and which was also the site of an ephemeral lava lake in December 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.13. A vaporous plume, emanating from Erebus on the 27th January 2001 at 20:25 \n\n[UTC], is visible in a) VNIR, while associated thermal anomalies are present in b) SWIR \n\nand c) temperature images. The background area is highlighted in c as a dark ring. All \n\nimages are to the same scale and North is up. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n3.6.2.2. L\u00e1scar \n\n \n\nThere is an increase in the size of low, moderate and high temperature anomalies during the first \n\neruptive episode of the L\u00e1scar time series (i.e. 20\nth\n\n June 2000 to 18\nth\n\n January 2001), as was also \n\nobserved in the intensity of the maximum temperature series. A SWIR anomaly is only detected \n\ntoward the end of this period and at 35 pixels in size, it is one of the largest in this data set. As \n\nmentioned previously no dome was observed in the active crater at this time (Bulletin of the \n\nGlobal Volcanism Network. L\u00e1scar. 2003), which may indicate that this large SWIR anomaly is \n\ndue to high temperature fumaroles. There may be a suggestion of a precursory increase in low \n\nand moderate temperature anomalies before this eruptive period. Again it is difficult to confirm \n\nsuch a hypothesis given the limited time span between the start of ASTERs operational life and \n\nthe onset of this eruption.  \n\n Low, high and, to a lesser extent, moderate anomalies show a progressive increase before \n\nthe third eruptive period (9\nth\n\n October 2002). This is analogous to the behaviour of maximum \n\npixel temperatures and indicates that the size and maximum temperature of thermal anomalies \n\nwere correlated at this time. The thermal distribution of anomalies suggests that fumarolic \n\nintensity was increasing over this time period, i.e. extensive, low temperature anomaly with an \n\nirregular, dynamic shape and a central warmer region that increases in both size and intensity \n\n(Fig. 3.14). SWIR anomalies were relatively extensive and stable in size (Fig. 3.12b iv) which is \n\nconsistent with an increase in the flux and/or temperature of emissions from existing fumaroles, \n\nas opposed to any significant expansion of the fumarole field.  \n\nLow and moderate temperature anomalies display a subtle gradual decrease followed by a \n\nsudden increase shortly before the eruption on 11\nth\n\n December 2003. This is perhaps analogous to \n\nthe behaviour of maximum temperatures before the 2006 eruption (Fig. 3.10b) as well as pre-\n\n1993 cycles (Matthews et al. 1997) which have been described above, and may therefore \n\nrepresent a subtle thermal precursor. No high temperature anomalies are recorded at the time and \n\na lack of nighttime scenes precludes the search for a similar pattern in the SWIR time series.  \n\n Four separate scenes contain high temperature anomalies within the 6 month period \n\nfollowing the December 2003 eruption. This may reflect a post-eruptive increase in fumarolic \n\nactivity, as was also inferred from the maximum temperature series. Low temperature anomalies \n\nshow a general decrease in size from around October 2004 until the 4\nth\n\n May 2005 eruption \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nensues. This contraction may pertain to minor permeability decreases in the upper conduit and \n\ncould be another example of a subtle thermal precursor. There was no apparent change in the size \n\nof moderate, high or SWIR anomalies before this eruption. Again this supports the hypothesis \n\nthat the source of the eruption was fairly shallow and that the relationship between fluid \n\noverpressure and the mechanical strength of containing rock in the upper conduit was already \n\nsomewhat critical. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.14. Increase in the size of low and high temperature anomalies and a consistently \n\nlarge SWIR anomaly precede an eruption of L\u00e1scar on 9th October 2002 eruption. All \n\nimages are to the same scale and North is up. \n\n \n\nThe low temperature anomaly series shows a distinct increase immediately after the penultimate \n\neruptive episode (i.e. 4\nth\n\n May 2005) and remains elevated up until the beginning of the last \n\neruptive period on 3\nrd\n\n April 2006. Conversely the moderate and SWIR anomalies display a \n\nsimilar pattern to that described for the maximum temperature series, i.e. a gradual decrease \n\nfollowed by an increase before eruption (Fig. 3.15). The onset of this increase occurs somewhere \n\nbetween 2 and 4 months before the start of the subsequent eruptive episode and is even \n\naccompanied by some high temperature anomalies. We suggest that degassing was an important \n\ncomponent of these anomalies given the extension and spatial configuration of the \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\ncontemporaneous low temperature anomalies and since no lava dome was observed during field \n\ninvestigations carried out at the time (Bulletin of the Global Volcanism Network. L\u00e1scar. 2006).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.15. A gradual decrease followed by an increase in the size and intensity of thermal \n\nanomalies precedes a surprisingly intense and long lasting eruptive period at L\u00e1scar. All \n\nimages are to the same scale and North is up. \n\n \n\n The final eruptive period (April 2006  - July 2007) is characterized by consistent high \n\ntemperature and SWIR anomalies that are confined to the centre of the active crater. It is possible \n\nthat lava was emplaced at this time although, as mentioned previously, field investigation did not \n\nreveal the presence of a dome. Alternatively a high temperature fumarole field may have \n\ndeveloped on the crater floor. This is consistent with contemporaneous chemical and isotopic \n\nanalyses of gas emissions from L\u00e1scar, which show that fumaroles within the active crater have a \n\nstronger magmatic signature (i.e. high SO2, HCL and HF) than fumaroles that are situated on the \n\ncrater rim (Tassi et al. 2009). Efficient degassing of the upper conduit appears to have been \n\nsustained throughout the eruptive period. An abrupt end to moderate, high and SWIR anomalies \n\ncoincide with the end of the final eruptive period. We note that low temperature anomalies \n\nremain quite large in size for approximately 6 months after this eruptive period, suggestive of \n\ndispersed fumarolic activity. The remainder of the data set displays considerable variability in the \n\nsize of low temperature anomalies. This may suggest that L\u00e1scar had entered a low level, \n\nintermittent degassing regime. \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\n3.7 Discussion \n\n \n\nThe maximum temperature above background and the size of anomalous areas are both measures \n\nthat can provide insight into dynamic volcanic behaviour and therefore be useful in a monitoring \n\ncontext. The maximum pixel temperature however can be less meaningful for sub-pixel-sized \n\nlava bodies. Several factors that may cause the resultant scattered response have been discussed \n\nabove. Here we briefly explore the dependence of the maximum pixel temperatures on the \n\nmaximum fraction of the lava lake in a given pixel. We then go on to comment on the size and \n\nintensity of thermal anomalies and their potential monitoring value at other volcanoes.  \n\n \n\n3.7.1. Scatter in maximum ?T at Erebus \n\n \n\nThe spectral radiance, L( ,T), emitted by a surface is described by the Planck function: \n\n \n\n       (3.6) \n\n \n\nat wavelength   and thermodynamic temperature T, and where ?  is spectral emissivity, and c1 \n\nand c2 are the radiation constants (i.e. c1 = 2?hc = 3.742\u00d710\n-16\n\n W m\n2\n and c2 = hc/k = 1.439\u00d710\n\n-2\n m \n\nK; where h is the Planck constant, c the speed of light and k the Boltzmann constant). Assuming \n\nthe spectral radiance and emissivity are known, the temperature of a remote surface can be \n\nestimated by rearranging: \n\n \n\n       (3.7) \n\n \n\nAs the emissivity of our target area was not known we assumed a maximum of 0.97 and then \n\napplied the Normalized Emissivity Method (Realmuto, 1990) for temperature retrieval with \n\nequation 3.7. In practice, the resultant pixel-integrated temperature is weighted according to the \n\nbandpass function of the sensor and the Planck radiation distribution of the target. As the \n\nradiation emitted from a surface is non-linearly dependent on temperature (i.e. Eq. 6) any \n\ntemperature retrieval will tend to diverge from the average temperature of subpixel thermal \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\ncomponents unless the target surface is isothermal. The magnitude of this divergence is usually \n\nsmall for typical terrestrial surfaces as targets tend to have limited sub-pixel thermal contrast and \n\nlow temperatures (i.e. &lt;100 \u00b0C; Garratt, 1992). However, it can be large in the presence of a high \n\ntemperature feature with strong spatial variability (such as a fissured active lava surface). \n\n To illustrate the effect that Erebus lava lake might have on a maximum pixel temperature \n\nwe model the active crater as a three component, blackbody system made up of a crust of lava at \n\n500 \u00b0C which can have incandescent cracks at 900 \u00b0C (Calkins et al. 2008) and is surrounded by \n\nground at -30\u00b0C. The lake can range in size from 700 to 1400 m\n2\n, the maximum fractional area of \n\nthe lake within any given ASTER TIR pixel can therefore range between 2.2 and 17.3 %. The \n\nlower fractional limit is calculated by assuming that the smallest possible lake area can be equally \n\ndivided between four pixels. The upper limit represents the situation in which the largest lake \n\narea is completely imaged within a single pixel. The maximum proportion of incandescent cracks \n\nwithin the lake is set as 0.1. This is because the maximum reported area of bubble burst (i.e. 60 \n\nm\n2\n; Calkins et al. 2008) would occupy 8.6 % of the smallest modelled lake size. The average \n\ntemperature of a 3 component thermal system is given by  \n\n \n\n        (3.8) \n\n \n\nwhere f is the fractional area of a component at temperature T, and the subscripts h, c and b \n\ndenote hot incandescent cracks, lava crust and non-active background, respectively. The \n\nmeasured pixel temperature (i.e. equation 3.7), on the other hand, depends on the sum of the \n\nindividual radiance components (i.e. equation 3. 9), which is not linearly related to temperature \n\nand will therefore result in divergence between the measured and average temperature. \n\n \n\n      (3.9) \n\n \n\nwhere Ltotal is the total spectral radiance measured by a single detector element whose waveband \n\nhas a mid-point at  , and L is the blackbody radiance emitted by isothermal components at \n\ntemperatures Th, Tc and Tb. The maximum pixel temperature within a given scene will therefore \n\nnot only depend on the physical properties of the target area but also on the maximum fractional \n\narea of the lava lake within an IFOV of a given detector element of a sensor array.  \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\n Absorption of volcanic gas species (e.g. H2O and SO2) is not modelled here as it will have \n\nlimited affect on temperatures calculated using the Normalized Emissivity Method. This is \n\nbecause the NEM algorithm automatically selects the band which has the largest brightness \n\ntemperature and is therefore likely to avoid bands that have undergone significant amounts of \n\nwavelength dependent absorption. Field measurements have shown however that transmission \n\nacross the TIR waveband (i.e. 7 - 13 ?m) is strongly attenuated by volcanic aerosols (Sawyer and \n\nBurton, 2006). This will affect temperature estimates as even the largest brightness temperatures \n\nwill have been significantly reduced. We therefore model the dependence of pixel temperatures \n\non the presence of aerosols as well, considering the case in which either a) no aerosols are present \n\nor b) aerosols cause a 30 % reduction in transmittance across all wavelengths (Fig. 3.16).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.16. Pixel temperature solutions (grey areas) for ASTER TIR bands as a function of \n\nthe fractional area of a lava lake within a given pixel. The average temperature of sub-pixel \n\ncomponents is given (solid blue lines). Aerosols can be either a) not present or b) cause a \n\n30% reduction in transmittance. The  maximum fractional area of the lake can range from \n\n0.022 to 0.173 (vertical dashed lines). Temperature ranges from ASTER bands 10 and 14 \n\nare plotted as pairs of red and green lines respectively and denote response ranges for the \n\ncases in which incandescent material occupies zero or 0.1 of the lake. The saturation \n\ntemperature of an ASTER TIR pixel, Tsat, is given as a horizontal red dotted line. \n\n \n\n The pixel temperature solutions (grey areas) are sensitive to the fractional area of the lava \n\nlake and can exceed the actual temperature (blue lines) by several tens of degrees. Significant \n\nscatter in maximum temperatures could therefore be produced by small (i.e. sub-pixel sized) \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nvariations in: lake size, spatial alignment between the target and pixel IFOVs, and the proportion \n\nof incandescent cracks within the lake. Aerosols can significantly reduce temperature solutions \n\n(Fig. 3.16b) and will act to provide further variability in maximum pixel temperatures. \n\n \n\n3.7.2. Background temperatures at other volcanoes \n\n \n\nThe global distribution of volcanoes and their varying topographies and compositions can lead to \n\nmarkedly different background temperatures from one edifice to the next. A standardized method \n\nfor measuring background temperatures would facilitate comparisons between volcanoes situated \n\naround the world. We attempt to make steps toward such a standardized approach by defining a \n\nbackground area that is situated as close to the region of activity as possible without becoming \n\nvolcanically heated and while also meeting a minimum size constraint. For Erebus and L\u00e1scar \n\nvolcanoes a ring shaped background area  was found to be suitable because activity is restricted \n\nto a single crater. However, different styles of volcanism (e.g. those with fissural morphologies, \n\nsuch as Erta 'Ale and Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull) may require different background geometries (e.g. an \n\nellipse).  \n\n To isolate a volcanic thermal signal it is necessary to estimate the background value. \n\nFurthermore, automatic anomaly detection requires that the natural variability in the background \n\nvalue is quantified. These can both be achieved in a straightforward, unbiased manner through \n\nthe use of arithmetic averages and standard deviation. However, such background statistics could \n\nbe compromised in the case that hot volcanic material (e.g. lava and/or pyroclastic flows) fall in \n\nthe background area. For global monitoring applications it would therefore be necessary to screen \n\nautomatically for anomalous pixels in the background area. This could be achieved through the \n\nuse of in-scene statistics or expected background values as derived from time series analysis. It \n\nwill probably be necessary to remove only the more extreme anomalies from the background area \n\nas subtle anomalies are unlikely to affect background statistics significantly. This is because hot \n\nvolcanic products, such as lava and pyroclastic flows, tend to be channelized and narrow in size \n\nclose to their source region. As such they will occupy very small proportions of a background \n\narea that encircles the entire source region. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\n3.7.3. Monitoring implications \n\n \n\nTwo clear thermal precursors and two subtle thermal precursors were identified in the L\u00e1scar \n\ntime series. The well-defined precursors are i) an increase in the size of low, moderate and high \n\ntemperature anomalies as well as consistently large SWIR anomalies for the 6 - 9 months \n\npreceding the 9\nth\n\n October 2002 eruptive episode, and ii) a gradual decrease, followed by an \n\nincrease, in the size of moderate temperature anomalies which is accompanied by high \n\ntemperature anomalies for roughly 3 months preceding the final eruptive period (i.e. start date 3\nrd\n\n \n\nApril 2006). The subtle thermal anomalies consisted of i) a gradual decrease followed by a \n\nsudden increase in the size of low and moderate temperature anomalies before the 11th December \n\n2003 eruptive episode, and ii) a gradual decrease in low temperature anomalies over an ~6 month \n\nperiod preceding the 4\nth\n\n May 2005 eruption. Monitoring efforts at L\u00e1scar could thus be usefully \n\naugmented by systematic spaceborne remote sensing in the future, especially given that the \n\nthermal precursors span timescales of a few months and therefore could have predictive value.  \n\n We envisage that measuring the size and intensity of thermal anomalies will provide \n\nuseful constraints for volcano monitoring teams in general. For example, the detection of a large, \n\nhot body would suggest significant activity has recently occurred and may indicate the presence \n\nof a lava flow or fresh pyroclastic material. The distinction between plumes and lava flows may \n\nalso be facilitated by the joint measurement of spatial and thermal information. Plumes will tend \n\nto be relatively low in temperature, extensive, irregular shaped, dynamic regions while lava flows \n\nwill tend to display higher temperatures and more consistent boundaries through time which have \n\neither point (i.e. dome) or lobate (i.e. flow) geometries. Such distinction, however, will often be \n\ninconclusive for sub-pixel sized bodies as no spatial information is available and strong thermal \n\nheterogeneities can lead to unreliable pixel temperatures at this spectral resolution. Significant \n\npost-eruptive changes in the size and or intensity of thermal anomalies can help to identify the \n\nend of an eruptive episode. This is important because the duration of an eruptive episode has been \n\nshown to be statistically related to both the repose time as well as the size of the next eruption \n\n(Marzocchi and Zaccarelli, 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n3.8. Conclusion \n\n \n\nThe spatial extent of anomalously hot pixels was introduced as a monitoring parameter for active  \n\nvolcanoes. Comparisons were made to short-wave infrared anomalies as well as to a previously \n\nreported thermal metric (i.e. the maximum temperature above background). We show that the \n\nsize of anomalous regions better correlates to eruptive activity than maximum temperature alone. \n\nMeasuring the size and intensity of thermal features can be used to improve our understanding of \n\nvolcanic systems by direct observation, as in this study, or through incorporation into \n\nprobabilistic or physical models. Future algorithms for volcanic activity detection may include a \n\nsearch for thermal anomalies which exceed a certain size and/or intensity. We note that such \n\nobservations are only possible because of ASTER's combined spatial and spectral resolution. \n\nEven so, future studies would benefit from a new generation of orbital, infrared sensors with \n\nimproved spatial resolution, such as NASA's proposed HyspIRI mission (Chien et al. 2009). Pixel \n\nsaturation issues could also be mitigated by extending the dynamic range of detector elements. \n\n  \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 4 \n\n \n\nMODIS and ASTER Synergy for Characterizing Thermal Volcanic Activity \n\n \n\n \n\nS. W. Murphy, R. Wright, C. Oppenheimer , C.R. de Souza Filho \n\nPublished in Remote Sensing of Environment, 131, 195-205, 2013. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1. Abstract \n\n \n\nVolcanic activity is diverse in its manifestations and spans wide temporal and spatial scales.  \n\nMonitoring volcanoes with any single sensor system can only provide a limited perspective on \n\nthe nature of such activity because of trade-offs between spatial, temporal and spectral resolution.  \n\nSpaceborne observations of volcanoes are thus optimised by utilising data from different and \n\ncomplementary remote sensing instruments.  This study examines the combined use of the \n\nModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Spaceborne \n\nThermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) for analyzing thermal anomalies from \n\nfour separate volcanoes: Erta \u2018Ale (Ethiopia), K?lauea (Hawai'i), L\u00e1scar (Chile) and Kliuchevskoi  \n\n(Russia).  MODIS provides a high temporal resolution (daily) but low spatial resolution (~ 1 km) \n\ndataset and is used to measure volcanic thermal radiance.  ASTER provides relatively high spatial \n\nresolution (~ 90 m) image data and is used to define the size of thermal features, albeit at a poorer \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\ntemporal frequency.  Erta \u2018Ale and  K?lauea  have been erupting continuously over the 11-year \n\nstudy period and their thermal emission signatures reveal a persistent  baseline  on  which  \n\noccasional  increases  in  thermal  output,  associated  with  more profuse effusions of lava, are \n\nsuperimposed. Kliuchevskoi also displays occasional peaks in thermal activity due to the eruption \n\nof lava however intervening periods are characterized by weak or absent thermal anomalies.  \n\nL\u00e1scar, on the other hand, provides an example of volcanic activity that is difficult for MODIS-\n\ntype sensors to detect.  It is characterized by fumarolic activity that is too low in temperature and \n\ntoo spatially limited to be readily detectable with its coarser instantaneous field of view (i.e., \n\npixel size). However, high resolution data from ASTER can be used to supplement and \n\ncomplement the MODIS dataset. Beyond characterizing the size of thermally anomalies ASTER \n\ncan also provide constraints on their shape, location and orientation and is capable of detecting \n\nrelatively subtle thermal anomalies given its high spatial resolution thermal infrared wavebands.  \n\nThese qualities permitted the identification of a thermal precursor to lava flows at Kliuchevskoi. \n\nThe precursor, which was associated with a rising lava lake, is characterized as an increase in the \n\nsize and intensity of ASTER-detected thermal anomalies situated in the active crater. Wavelet \n\nanalysis of the MODIS dataset was also carried out.  This revealed the time scales over which \n\nradiant output waxed and waned during individual eruptive episodes as well as the repose time \n\nbetween episodes. Such information might be useful in forecasting the likely duration and onset \n\nof future eruptions. \n\n \n\n4.2. Introduction \n\n \n\nVolcanoes can be hazardous to both people and property yet also provide valuable insights into \n\ndynamic processes on Earth. It is necessary to monitor active volcanoes to mitigate the risks that \n\nthey pose and to improve our understanding of these complex physical systems.   \n\n Volcanic activity involves the transfer of mass and heat to the Earth\u2019s surface. The surface \n\ntemperature and emissivity of a physical body determine the amount of energy it radiates at any \n\ngiven wavelength.  Planck\u2019s law describes this relationship, which is modified to account for \n\nspectral emissivity as follows: \n\n  \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\n \n\n       (4.1) \n\n \n\nwhere  L( ,T)   is  spectral  radiance  (W m\n-2\n\n sr\n-1\n\n ?m\n-1\n)  as  a function  of wavelength  ( ) and  \n\nkinetic temperature (T), ?  is spectral emissivity, and c1 and c2 are the radiation constants \n\n(i.e., c1 = 2hc\n2\n = 1.19?10\n\n-16\n W m\n\n2\n sr\n\n-1\n and c2 = hc/k = 1.439?10\n\n-2\n m K; where h is the Planck \n\nconstant, c the speed of light and k the Boltzmann constant). \n\n This work explores the use of polar-orbiting satellites for monitoring volcanic thermal \n\nradiance from space. The types of sensors used for this purpose can be classified into two broad \n\ncategories: i) high to moderate spatial resolution (i.e., &lt;100 m pixel\n-1\n\n) but low temporal \n\nresolution (i.e., > 10 day) imagers, and ii) high temporal (i.e., 1 ? day) but low spatial resolution \n\n(i.e., ? 1 km) imagers. The two categories will be referred to as i) high spatial resolution and ii) \n\nhigh temporal resolution for the remainder of this article. We note that although the meaning of \n\nadjectives such as \u2018advanced\u2019, \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018moderate\u2019 change with time as far as capabilities are \n\nconcerned they have still been used widely to name many of the existing orbital imagers. High \n\nspatial resolution systems that have been used to monitor volcanic thermal radiance include: the \n\nThematic Mapper onboard Landsat 4 and 5 (e.g.,, Francis and Rothery, 1987; Rothery et al., \n\n1988; Glaze et al., 1989; Oppenheimer, 1991), the Optical Sensor on the Japanese Earth \n\nResources Satellite-1 (JERS-1) (e.g., Denniss et al., 1996, Dean et al., 1998), the Enhanced \n\nThematic Mapper Plus on Landsat 7 (e.g., Flynn et al., 2001; Wright et al., 2001; Patrick et al., \n\n2004), the Advanced Land Imager on the Earth Observing-1 mission (e.g., Donegan and Flynn, \n\n2004), and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) \n\nonboard the Terra satellite (e.g., Vaughan and Hook, 2006; Rose and Ramsey, 2009, Murphy et \n\nal., 2011). On the other hand high temporal resolution polar orbiters include: the Advanced Very \n\nHigh Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) flown on the NOAA satellite series (e.g., Harris et al., \n\n1997, Tramutoli, 1998), and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (e.g., \n\nWright et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2004; Kervyn, 2008; Koeppen et al., 2011) onboard both the \n\nTerra and Aqua satellites. The temporal and spectral resolution of MODIS, as well as its global \n\ncoverage and reliable geometric and radiometric calibration, led to its application in the world\u2019s \n\nfirst automated system for global volcano monitoring, i.e., MODVOLC (Wright et al., 2002; \n\nWright et al., 2004). \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n Volcanic phenomena span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. It may take years, \n\ndecades or longer for magma to migrate to the surface, whilst a pyroclastic flow can be emplaced \n\nin minutes.  A volcanic ash plume can extend over thousands of kilometres yet ejecta are \n\ntypically metre scale or less. This disparity means that there is no single sensor in existence that \n\nis capable of acquiring data over the spatial and temporal scales exhibited by all of Earth\u2019s \n\nvolcanoes. Volcano monitoring efforts therefore need to integrate and interrogate data from \n\nnetworks of sensors. From a volcanologist\u2019s perspective an ideal network would include \n\nterrestrial, airborne and spaceborne sensors. In practice, since most of Earth\u2019s potentially active \n\nand active volcanoes are subject to at best only rudimentary ground-based monitoring, orbital \n\nsensors are a crucial data source for tracking global volcanism. \n\n The  Terra  satellite,  which  carries  both  the  ASTER  and a MODIS  system,  offers an \n\nexcellent opportunity to explore the potential of combining both high spatial and high temporal \n\nresolution datasets for monitoring volcanoes from space (e.g., Vaughan and Hook, 2006, Hirn et \n\nal., 2008, Vaughan et al., 2008). The ASTER sensor consists of three separate subsystems in the \n\nvisible and near-infrared (VNIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) with \n\nrespective pixel sizes of 15, 30 and 90 m. The SWIR subsystem ceased to provide useful Earth \n\nobservation data in 2008 due to a cooler malfunction although the VNIR and TIR instruments \n\ncontinue to operate normally. MODIS has 32 spectral channels in the VNIR, SWIR, mid infrared \n\n(MIR) and TIR wavelengths with nominal pixel resolutions ranging from 250, 500 and 1000 m. \n\nTemporal resolution for all channels is 24 hours. Multiple simultaneous viewing opportunities are \n\npossible as both sensors are carried by the same satellite platform. \n\n The aim of this work is to compare how two different sensor classes report the temporal, \n\nspatial and thermal characteristics of a range of target volcanoes. The targets were chosen \n\nbecause they display different eruptive characteristics and would therefore be useful in testing the \n\nperformance of high temporal resolution (i.e. MODIS class) and high spatial resolution (i.e. \n\nASTER class) sensor systems at cataloguing different styles of volcanic activity. The term \"style\" \n\nhere is simplified to mean whether thermal activity is any of the following: low temperature, high \n\ntemperature, small, large, persistent or not persistent. A decadal time series has been used to a \n\ngive a longer term perspective on this. \n\n   \n\n \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n4.3. Study Areas \n\n  \n\nFour different volcanoes have been investigated: i) K?lauea (Hawai'i), ii) L\u00e1scar (Chile), iii)  Erta \n\n\u2018Ale (Ethiopia)  and  iv)  Kliuchevskoi  (Kamchatka,  Russia).  Each site represents a markedly \n\ndifferent type of volcanic setting: i) intra-plate \u2018hot spot\u2019 volcanism with frequent effusive \n\nbasaltic eruptions (K?lauea), ii) a continental-oceanic subduction zone with persistent degassing, \n\nsporadic lava dome growth and intermittent explosions (L\u00e1scar), iii) a continental rift zone with \n\nan active lava lake (Erta \u2018Ale) and iv) a volcanic arc (Kliuchevskoi). These sites were selected for \n\ntheir contrasted settings and eruptive styles, enabling a more thorough evaluation of the \n\ncapabilities and limitations of each sensor. \n\n  \n\n4.4. Metrics for Volcanic Thermal Activity \n\n  \n\nThis study was concerned with the characterization of thermally anomalous surfaces. Two \n\nmetrics that quantify different aspects of such surfaces are defined. The first (MOD*) uses \n\nMODIS data to describe spectral intensity. The second (AST*) estimates the size of anomalous \n\nareas using the ASTER sensor. \n\n   \n\n4.4.1. MOD* (High temporal resolution volcanic radiance) \n\n  \n\nThe MODIS dataset used in this study is comprised of all the available nighttime, calibrated \n\nradiance scenes (i.e., MOD021KM) and their corresponding geolocation products (i.e., MOD03) \n\nacquired for each volcano by MODIS-Terra since its launch in 1999. These data are available \n\nfrom the Level 1 and Atmosphere Archive and Distribution System (LAADS) maintained by the \n\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center. Over the study period (i.e., 1 January 2000 to 1 January \n\n2012) there are 3709 scenes for Erta \u2018Ale, 5391 scenes for Kliuchevskoi, 4261 scenes for K?lauea \n\nand 3772 scenes for L\u00e1scar (i.e., a total of 17,133 MOD02 1KM scenes). The combined size of \n\nthis data set (i.e., 1.7 Tb) was reduced by cropping scenes and selecting pertinent spectral \n\nchannels.   \n\n The MOD* metric is designed to represent the overall amount of MIR radiance from \n\nthermally anomalous areas. Given the IFOV of the MODIS instrument the vast majority of \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\nthermal anomalies will be subpixel in size. A radiance measurement from a single detector \n\nelement will therefore often contain contributions from volcanically active areas and non-active \n\nbackground areas. We have used channel 21 (i.e., 3.929 - 3.989 \u00b5m)  to characterize the radiance \n\nfrom volcanically active areas and channel 32 (i.e., 11.77 - 12.270 \u00b5m) to characterize the \n\nradiance from non-active background areas. This is because MIR detector arrays \n\n(e.g., channel 21) are much more sensitive to volcanic temperatures (i.e., hundreds of degrees \n\nCelsius) than TIR detector arrays (e.g., channel 32). To illustrate this point let us consider an \n\nisothermal background surface at 20 \no\nC that occupies the entire IFOV of detector elements in \n\nchannel 21 and 32; the radiance from each channel will be 0.5 and 8.1 W m\n-2\n\n sr\n-1\n\n ?m\n-1\n\n, \n\nrespectively. In the case that the IFOV also contained a second isothermal surface with a \n\ntemperature of 500 \no\nC  and area of 100 m\n\n2\n (i.e., 0.01% of MODIS pixel) then the radiance from \n\neach channel would be 11.72 and 9.32, respectively. That is, the TIR radiance in channel 32 will \n\nincrease by 14.8% whilst the MIR radiance in channel 21 will increase by 2232%. The MOD* \n\nmetric uses this relationship to define anomalous radiance in channel 21 as follows: \n\n \n\n        (4.2) \n\n \n\nwhere n is the number of anomalous pixels, Li  is the spectral radiance and Li,bkgd  the background \n\nspectral radiance of the i\nth\n\n anomalous pixel in channel 21. The background radiance was \n\ncalculated by using the brightness temperature in channel 32 as a proxy for the temperature of the \n\nnon-active background areas. This background temperature (i.e., from TIR wavelengths) was \n\nthen used to calculate background radiance (i.e., in MIR wavelengths) for channel 21. A pixel is \n\nconsidered to be anomalous if its Normalized Thermal Index (i.e., NTI) exceeds a threshold \n\nvalue. The NTI (equation 4.3) utilizes the relative sensitivity of MIR and TIR wavelengths \n\noutlined above to detect thermally active volcanic targets from space (Wright et al. 2002). \n\n \n\n         (4.3) \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\nwhere  L22 and L32 are  spectral  radiance  measurements  from  MODIS  channels  22  and  32, \n\nrespectively. MODIS channels 22 and 21 cover the same spectral region but have different \n\nsaturation limits (i.e., brightness temperatures of around 60 and 225 \no\nC, respectively) and \n\nradiometric accuracy (i.e., noise equivalent temperature variation, NE?T, of 0.07 and 2.0 K, \n\nrespectively). If saturation occurs in channel 22 then radiance from channel 21 was automatically \n\nused instead. A global threshold of -0.8 was proposed by Wright et al. (2004) to identify volcanic \n\nthermally anomalies from nighttime MODIS scenes. This global threshold was set relatively high \n\nto avoid false alarms. To increase anomaly detection sensitivity it is possible to define volcano-\n\nspecific thresholds (e.g., Kervyn, 2008, Koeppen et al., 2011). To find an optimal local NTI \n\nthreshold we first calculated the frequency distribution of all NTI values for each volcano \n\n(Fig. 4.1).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1. The frequency distribution of MODIS Normalized Thermal Index (NTI) at a) \n\nErta \u2018Ale, b) K?lauea, c) Kliuchevskoi and d) L\u00e1scar. Optimal local anomaly thresholds are \n\nshown using a solid, red line. The global MODVOLC threshold is shown using a dashed, \n\ngrey line for comparison. \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\n \n\n The NTI values that correspond to volcanic hot-spots represent a tiny percentage of pixels \n\nat the extreme right hand tail of the distribution, pixels that are not anomalous will correspond \n\nalmost exclusively to NTI values in the rest of the distribution. An optimal threshold needs to be \n\nfound to limit the number of false positives and missed anomalies. This was achieved by \n\nchecking that the spatial distribution of anomalies was reasonable throughout the time series (Fig. \n\n4.2) and that anomalies did not display seasonal variations through time (Fig. 4.3).  The \n\nbimodality of the K?lauea histogram (Fig. 4.1b) is due the presence of both land and water in the \n\narea used to calculate local NTI values at this volcano. The location of anomalous pixels were \n\nrecorded on a scene by scene basis and anomaly frequency maps were calculated for each \n\nvolcano (Fig. 4.2). \n\nThese maps depict the frequency with which an anomalous NTI value was detected at a \n\ngiven location over an 11 year period. Zero frequency areas are filled in using MODIS visible \n\nwavebands to provide a geographic context. Local NTI histograms (Fig. 4.1) were calculated \n\nfrom the entirety of scenes depicted in Figure 4.2, the MOD* time series was calculated from \n\nsmaller areas outlined using a white, dashed box. Figure 4.2a shows that activity at Erta \u2018Ale is \n\nconfined to the summit caldera. The fairly large (i.e., several km\n2\n) but low frequency region to \n\nthe NNW is associated with the Alu-Dalaffilla fissure eruption of November 2008. Activity at \n\nK?lauea is more spatially extensive and mainly corresponds with the lavas erupted on the \n\nvolcano\u2019s East Rift Zone (Fig. 4.2b). Dotted around the Big Island are areas which contained \n\nshort-lived thermal activity (i.e., low probability areas). They have previously been interpreted as \n\nresulting from vegetation fires (Koeppen et al., 2011). This might also be the cause of similar low \n\nprobability areas surrounding Kliuchevskoi (Fig. 4.2c). Volcanic anomalies can be observed over \n\nboth Kliuchevskoi and Bezymianny. L\u00e1scar\u2019s thermal features are constrained solely to the active \n\nsummit crater (Fig. 4.2d). Clearly anomaly frequency maps display the likely location of \n\nthermally anomalous areas over time, as such, they might be useful during hazard planning \n\nexercises. They also help more generally to distinguish effusive activity (i.e., K?lauea) from lava \n\ndomes or lakes situated in craters (i.e., L\u00e1scar and Erta \u2018Ale ). Kliuchevskoi combines both types \n\nof behaviour. Thus, even if we knew nothings about these volcanoes beforehand it would be \n\npossible from Figure 4.2 to determine that they represent different types of volcanic activity. \n\nAnnual anomaly frequency maps for each volcano are provided in the supplementary material. \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 4.2.

AST* (Size of anomalous areas) \n\n \n\nThis study uses the ASTER TIR at-surface radiance product (AST_09T) which is geometrically, \n\nradiometrically, and atmospherically corrected by the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive \n\nCenter (LP  DAAC) of  the United States  Geological  Survey (USGS).  We obtain terrestrial \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\nsurface temperatures from this product using the Normalized Emissivity Method (Realmuto, \n\n1990) with maximum emissivity set to 0.97. The ASTER Surface Kinetic Temperature (AST_08) \n\nproduct, which is based on the Temperature Emissivity Separation (i.e. TES) algorithm (Gillespie \n\net al. 1998), was not used in this study because we could not verify whether the empirical \n\nrelationship between laboratory-derived emissivity values and spectral contrast would apply in an \n\nactive volcanic setting. An inspection for cloud cover was carried out on the temperature image. \n\nIf clouds completely obscured the volcano so that it could not be located visually in a TIR image \n\nthen that scene was removed from the dataset.   \n\n The AST* metric utilizes the relatively high spatial resolution of the ASTER sensor to \n\nmeasure the size of thermally anomalous areas. \n\n \n\n         (4.4) \n\n \n\nwhere A is the nominal area of an ASTER pixel (i.e., 8100 m\n2\n) and n* is the number of \n\nanomalous pixels in a given scene. ASTER pixels were identified as anomalous if their \n\ntemperature above background exceeded 40 \no\nC. This threshold was selected to ensure an \n\nextremely low false alarm rate (i.e., perhaps zero) and to avoid the incorporation of too many \n\nephemeral, low temperature gas plumes. The motivation for filtering cool gas plumes is that they \n\ncan change dramatically in size on time scales that are orders of magnitude greater than the \n\nrevisit time of the sensor (i.e., minutes compared to days or weeks) and will therefore produce \n\nscatter in the data that masks other, more persistent thermal features. \n\n Even at the spatial resolution of ASTER TIR bands (i.e., 90 m) it is likely that its \n\nindividual detector elements will measure radiance from surfaces at markedly different \n\ntemperatures over hot volcanic targets. Any one pixel temperature will therefore give only a \n\nqualitative measure of volcanic thermal heating. However, given that the AST* metric is \n\nrestricted to measuring the size of thermally anomalous areas, it remains robust against this effect \n\nof subpixel thermal mixing. Although anomalous pixels could be identified using pixel radiance \n\ninstead of pixel temperature we have utilized the latter because it is more robust against \n\npotentially variable spectral emissivity profiles as well as wavelength dependent absorption \n\nfeatures (e.g. due to SO2 or ash aerosols). ASTER TIR channels will saturate quite frequently \n\nover hot volcanic targets (i.e., saturation brightness temperatures ? 97 \no\nC), especially given their \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\nrelatively small IFOV, this issue was also avoided by limiting the AST* metric to measuring just \n\nthe size of thermal anomalies. \n\n The temperature above background was calculated by subtracting a background \n\ntemperature from the NEM temperature array. The background temperature was defined as the \n\naverage pixel temperature in the background area. This area was defined as an annulus around the \n\nactive crater at Erta \u2018Ale, Kliuchevskoi and L\u00e1scar and as a collection of user-defined points at \n\nK?lauea. The methodology for determining the optimal size of an annulus is described in detail by \n\nMurphy et al. (2011). Hot volcanic features (e.g., lava or pyroclastic flows) occasionally crossed \n\nthe background area (i.e., at Kliuchevskoi). The corresponding pixels were automatically \n\nscreened from the background area using a threshold of twice the standard deviation of the entire \n\ntemperature array (i.e., an area of ~ 62 km\n2\n). The search area used to find anomalous ASTER \n\npixels included (and extended beyond) the background area to ensure that all volcanic thermal \n\nfeatures were included in the AST* metric.  \n\n Lava flows, pyroclastic flows and ash/gas plumes typically travel in a preferred direction \n\nfrom a stratocone due to local topography or wind direction. The 2D projection that these features \n\ncreate in an image acquired from space could, for illustrative purposes, be defined as a narrow arc \n\n(&lt;20\no\n) originating from the active crater. The relative magnitude of the area of intersection \n\nbetween an arc (i.e. an active volcanic feature) and an annulus (i.e. the background area) and the \n\ntotal area of the annulus is given by: \n\n \n\n          (4.5) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the area of intersection, A is the size of the background area, and   is the angular \n\nwidth of the arc in radians. For a 20\no\n arc (i.e., 0.35 radians) the area of intersect would be 5.6% of \n\nthe background area. Therefore pixels which contain contributions from cold ash plumes or warm \n\nvolcanogenic material (i.e., that were not hot enough to be automatically removed by the clipping \n\nprocedure) would still have a limited effect on the background temperature. The geometry of an \n\nannulus is therefore naturally stable against the intrusion of fresh volcanogenic material. \n\nFurthermore the circular nature of the annulus acts towards balancing the preferential solar \n\nheating effects that are created by varying amounts of solar irradiance around the volcanic \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\nedifice. Therefore the annulus approach for calculating background temperatures from \n\nstratocones is favoured in this work. At the K?lauea shield volcano, which frequently exhibits \n\nactive lava flow fields covering several km\n2\n, the annulus approach was not possible. The \n\nbackground area was therefore defined as a collection of user-defined points around the flow \n\nfield in this case. We note that a single background  temperature cannot accurately characterise \n\nsuch an extensive area given that significant, non-volcanic variations in terrestrial temperatures \n\noccur across it. The annulus methodology (i.e., used for all volcanoes but K?lauea) is estimated to \n\nprovide background temperatures to within 5 \no\nC based on inspection of radial temperature \n\ngradients from the active crater. This method is described in detail by Murphy et al. (2011). The \n\nuser-defined points (i.e., used for K?lauea only) give background temperatures to within 15 \no\nC \n\n(i.e. twice the maximum standard deviation of the background data points). \n\n \n\n4.5. Wavelet Analysis \n\n \n\nWavelet analysis reveals the periodicity in a time series of data. A wavelet (?) is a wave function \n\nof finite duration (i.e., it is localized). The Morlet wavelet was used with a central frequency of \n\nsix for this study. A continuous wavelet transform will convert data from the time domain to a \n\ntime-frequency domain through the convolution of a time series with translated (i.e. moved in \n\ntime) and scaled (i.e. stretched) versions of the original wavelet function. This involves \n\nevaluating the integral of the product of the data points with the wavelet function. Conceptually \n\nthis equates to quantifying the amount of overlap between the area under the curve defined by the \n\ndata points and the area under the curve defined by the wavelet function. Power is the metric of \n\nthis overlap. As power is calculated for a range of translation and scale parameters the resulting \n\nwavelet transform will represent how well the wavelet and the data match at different locations in \n\ntime and at different periods of oscillation. A period of oscillation is the length of time over \n\nwhich an oscillation occurs (i.e., it is equivalent to the reciprocal of frequency). Power was \n\nnormalized by the maximum value in each transform. This provides a unitless measure of \n\nperiodicity that varies from zero to one. A practical guide to wavelet analysis is given by \n\nTorrence and Campo (1998). Examples of wavelet analysis in volcanology include studies of  \n\nthermal image data from handheld infrared cameras (Spampinato et al., 2012) and geochemical \n\ntime series measuring plume composition (Oppenheimer et al., 2009; Boichu et al., 2010).  \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\n4.6. Results  \n\n \n\n4.6.1. Time series  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 shows the entire MOD*and AST* datasets. They span the period between 24 February \n\n2000 (i.e., the first available scene) to 1 January 2012. Erta \u2018Ale and K?lauea (Fig. 4.3 a,b) have \n\nbeen erupting continuously over the study period. Kliuchevskoi and L\u00e1scar (Fig. 4.3 c,d) \n\nunderwent intermittent eruptive episodes that are displayed using pink shading.  Eruptive \n\nhistories are mostly obtained from reports of the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian \n\nInstitute (Venzke et al., 2002 - ). \n\nErta \u2018Ale was frequently active throughout the 11 year study period. MOD* values are \n\ngenerally below 5 W m\n-2\n\n sr\n-1\n\n \u00b5m\n-1\n\n  (i.e., 99.3 % of data points), although peaks in thermal output \n\ndo occasionally exceed this values (i.e., up to a maximum MOD* of 14.4). There are two periods \n\nwere MOD* values remain close to zero for months at a time (i.e., June - November 2003 and \n\nOctober 2004 to April 2005). This may indicate that the height of the lava lake was particularly \n\nlow during these periods. Conversely, episodes characterized by high lava lake levels - as \n\nobserved in the field (e.g., November 2010 overflow) - correspond with peaks in MOD* values \n\n(i.e., 7.0 in this case). Variations in lava lake height are controlled by a number of factors, \n\nincluding magma reservoir pressure, vesiculation and conduit-crater morphology.   \n\n The size of the thermal anomaly, as given by the AST* metric, varies between roughly \n\n1 - 4 \u00d7 10\n5\n m\n\n2\n (i.e., 1 - 5 ASTER pixels). The linear Pearson correlation coefficient between \n\nAST* and MOD* is 0.54. That is, the size of thermally anomalous areas as measured by ASTER \n\ndoes not show a particularly strong correlation with the MIR radiance measured by MODIS. This \n\nis because the radiance emitted from the lava lake varies considerably more than the size of the \n\nlava lake. Radiant output can change significantly for a given lake area, for example, through \n\nconvective overturning of the lake surface and bubble burst, both of which result in varying \n\nexposure of hot, incandescent material through time. \n\n   \n\n \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3. The MOD* time series (blue bars) is a measure of volcanic radiance [W m\n-2\n\n sr\n-1\n\n \n\n?m\n-1\n\n]; the AST* time series (filled circles with a dotted trend line) represents the size of \n\nthermally anomalous areas [1000's m\n2\n]. Pink bars depict discrete eruptive episodes. \n\n \n\nK?lauea is the most consistently active volcano in this study and is characterized by \n\nfrequent fissure, flank and crater eruptions of low viscosity basalt lava. These effusive eruptions \n\noften result in tube fed flows that are capable of travelling several kilometres from the source \n\nvent. Consequently the MOD* time series displays a relatively high average of \n\n\n\n83 \n \n\n7.5 W m\n-2\n\n sr\n-1\n\n \u00b5m\n-1\n\n with peaks exceeding 50 W m\n-2\n\n sr\n-1\n\n \u00b5m\n-1\n\n (i.e. coincident with outbreaks from \n\nthe lava tubes). Several episodes of elevated thermal emission are apparent (e.g., January-\n\nSeptember 2005, July 2007 to April 2008, and July 2008). The latest of these is particularly \n\nsignificant because it was the largest in the data set (i.e., MOD* of 232; 7\nth\n\n July 2008), it \n\noccurred during the eruption of three simultaneously lava fountains (BGVN 2010) and yet was \n\ncompletely missed by the ASTER sensor.  \n\n Although high spatial resolution imagers, such as ASTER, are more likely to miss such \n\nshort lived dynamic events, the imagery that they provide offer superior constraints on the size, \n\nshape, orientation and location of thermal anomalies. For example, a lava flow field imaged \n\nsimultaneously by both sensors on 7 June 2003 (Fig. 4.4) exhibits individual lava tubes of \n\nvarying age that clearly form an interconnected network in the ASTER image (Fig. 4.4a), whilst \n\nit is only possible to determine the orientation and length of the overall flow field in the MODIS \n\nimage (Fig. 4.4b).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4. Brightness temperatures from a) ASTER channel 10 and b) MODIS channel 22 \n\nof the Pu'u '?'?  flow field on the 7\nth\n\n June 2003. ASTER is able to characterize the size, \n\nshape, location and orientation of individual lava flow tubes. \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\nHigh spatial resolution data, as exemplified here by ASTER, would clearly be more \n\nuseful for operational assessment of i) damage to local infrastructure (e.g., buildings, roads, etc.), \n\nii) future flow direction (especially given that surface breakouts occur from the tubes), and iii) the \n\nrisk of fire (e.g., through proximity to combustible material), given timely availability of the \n\nimage, or a high-level monitoring product derived from the image. \n\n  The size of thermal anomalies at K?lauea have a mean AST* value of 8.9 x 10\n5\n m\n\n2\n (i.e., \n\n110 pixels) with a standard deviation of 9.6 x 10\n5\n m\n\n2\n (i.e., 118 pixels). They can therefore be very \n\nlarge yet also vary significantly in size through time. The most extensive anomaly in the AST* \n\nseries is 5.55 \u00d710\n6\n m\n\n2\n (i.e., 685 pixels). The correlation coefficient between AST* and MOD* is \n\n0.65 (i.e. anomaly size and MIR radiance are more closely matched at this volcano than at Erta \n\n\u2018Ale). \n\n Kliuchevskoi exhibits a more sporadic eruptive style, often spending prolonged periods of \n\ntime with no, or very limited signs of thermal activity (Fig. 4.3c). There are four major peaks in \n\nthe MOD* series i) 20 January to 7 April 2005, ii) 22 April to 25 June 2007, iii) 30 October 2008 \n\nto 10 January 2009, and iv) 1 November 2009 to 1 November 2010. These correspond with \n\nStrombolian eruptions and lava flows (Venzke et al., 2002 - ). The first three major peaks are \n\nfairly symmetric and last around 2-3 months. The forth is asymmetric and last for about a year, \n\nwith a prolonged period of Strombolian activity, followed by more extensive lava flows and \n\nculminating in a Vulcanian eruption (Venzke et al., 2002 - ) after which time thermal activity \n\ncame to an abrupt end. \n\n  The maximum MOD* values for the symmetric peaks are, in consecutive order: 88.6, \n\n145.8 and 144.9. These peaks have mean MOD* values of 10.4, 30.0 and 11.8, respectively.  The \n\nforth major peak displays a higher maximum MOD* value (i.e., 166.7) and a lower mean MOD* \n\nvalue (6.9). The maximum extents of thermal anomalies during these four major episodes range \n\nfrom 5.6 x 10\n5\n to 9.6 x 10\n\n5\n m\n\n2\n. That is, they are comparable in size of K?lauea flows, although \n\noverall slightly smaller. Correlation between AST* and MOD* is relatively high overall (i.e. \n\n0.85). The increased correlation between size and intensity at Kliuchevskoi compared to K?lauea \n\nis probably because lava flows from Kliuchevskoi\u2019s stratocone do not form tubes. At K?lauea \n\nhowever the formation of tubes means that radiance from these flows will depend on the \n\nproportion of exposed to concealed lava. \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\n Inspection of ASTER scenes reveals a thermal precursor to two of the lava flow events \n\n(Fig. 4.5).  The precursor is defined by thermal anomalies that are situated within the summit \n\ncrater and that increase in both size and intensity through time. The increase in size is interpreted \n\nas resulting from an increasing amount of ponded lava in the active crater, as has been observed \n\nin the field (BGVN 2009).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5. Thermal precursors to lava flow activity at Kliuchevskoi are characterized by \n\nanomalies in the active crater that increase in size and intensity. \n\n \n\n The increase in intensity is due to greater radiant heat loss from the lava surface, which is \n\ndependent on both size and temperature. After the precursory infilling of the summit crater, lava \n\nbreached the crater rim and descended the flanks of the volcano (BGVN 2007,2009). Such \n\nobservations could be used to create simple, automated thermal precursors to lava flow activity at \n\nKliuchevskoi and other similar volcanoes. If, for example, an alert had been based on detection of \n\n5 or more pixels situated in the active crater with a temperature above background of at least 40 \n\no\nC, then both lava flow events could have been anticipated two weeks before they were seen \n\ndescending the flank. This demonstrates the utility that moderate to high spatial resolution \n\ndatasets  can  provide  when  their  revisit  periods  are  adequate  to  capture  changing  levels  of \n\nactivity. \n\n L\u00e1scar displays very low MOD*, i.e., mainly lower than 0.5 and with a maximum of 2.5 \n\n(Fig. 4.3d). Scatter in MODIS anomalies, created by imperfect correction for MIR background \n\nradiance and atmospheric effects, can result in negative anomaly values. Thermal activity at this \n\nvolcano, characterized by persistent degassing from fumaroles in and around the active crater, is \n\nparticularly difficult for low spatial resolution sensors such as MODIS to detect because the \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\nthermally active region is low in temperature, and relatively small in size compared to the \n\ninstantaneous field of view (IFOV) of the sensor. Consequentially the radiation falling on any \n\none detector element contains a limited contribution from the target area. ASTER, on the other \n\nhand, regularly detects thermal anomalies at L\u00e1scar. AST* values range from roughly 10,000 to \n\n40,000 m\n2\n in size. These anomalies are probably due to varying degrees of fumarolic activity \n\nfrom the active crater (Murphy et al. 2011). The higher spatial resolution (i.e. smaller  IFOV)  of  \n\nASTER  allows  it  to  detect  relatively subtle thermal anomalies. Figure 4.6 illustrates this point \n\nby displays an ASTER image of a persistent thermal anomaly in L\u00e1scar\u2019s active crater (Fig. 4.6a) \n\njuxtaposed with a contemporaneous MODIS image acquired over the same area (Fig. 4.6b). The \n\nanomaly is evident in the ASTER image yet remains completely undetected by the MODIS \n\nsensor. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6. Contemporaneous images of a) ASTER channel 10 and b) MODIS channel 22 of \n\nL\u00e1scar taken on 2\nnd\n\n October 2000. ASTER is capable of detecting subtle thermal anomalies \n\nthat may fall below the MODIS detection limit. L\u00e1scar\u2019s active crater is highlighted using a \n\nred dashed circle. \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\n4.6.2. Wavelet Power Spectra \n\n \n\nThe high temporal resolution of MODIS lends itself to more detailed time series analysis.  A \n\ncontinuous wavelet transform was applied to the MOD* time series of a) Erta \u2018Ale, b) K?lauea \n\nand c) Kliuchevskoi (Fig. 4.7). Shown for each volcano are i) the original MOD* time series, and \n\nii) the wavelet power spectrum.  \n\n The axes of the wavelet power spectrum are time against period of oscillation. Time is \n\nplotted in years (x-axis) and period of oscillation is plotted in years (left y-axis) using a log base \n\n2 scale and also in the equivalent amount of days (right y-axis).  Power is represented using a \n\ncolour scale. Peaks in the power spectrum (i.e. warmer colours) indicate periodicity in the time \n\nseries at the corresponding time and period of oscillation. During the convolution process \n\nwavelets may be translated towards (or beyond) the edge of the finite time series, especially at \n\nlonger periods, producing spurious results in the corresponding part of the power spectrum. This \n\nregion is known as the cone of influence and is represented in grey to leave only the reliable part \n\nof the power spectrum visible. Certain instances in time are highlighted in the power spectrum \n\nusing a vertical, dashed white line. The corresponding period against power plot for each of these \n\ntime slices is displayed in Figure 4.8. \n\n Erta \u2018Ale (Fig. 4.7aii) displays two time intervals revealing a periodicity of approximately \n\n1/2 a year centred around June 2002 and August 2007. The latter event also shows significant \n\nperiodicity at 1/16 to 1/4 of a year (i.e., 23 - 91 days). A time slice of the power spectrum at these \n\ntwo times (i.e. time slice 1 and 2) is displayed in Figure 4.8. These time slices also clearly show \n\nlow period signals (i.e. around 2 days) that are approximately contemporaneous with sharp peaks \n\nin the MOD* time series (Fig. 4.7ai). A strong periodicity (i.e., power = 0.93) occurs at a long \n\nperiod (i.e., 4 years) around the turn of 2006 (Fig 4.7aii). It is associated with the spacing \n\nbetween the two periodicity events highlighted in time slice 1 and 2. This spacing is actually \n\ncloser to 5 years than 4 but is not definable within this power spectrum because the \n\ncorresponding periodicity falls into the cone of influence. To characterize longer period events, \n\nsuch as this one, it is necessary to have a longer time series. Less prominent peaks also appear in \n\nthe power spectrum of Erta \u2018Ale. Most remarkable among these are perhaps the dual periodicity \n\ncomponent at 6.16 x 10\n-3\n\n and 2.3 x 10\n-2\n\n years (i.e., 2 and 8 days) because they reoccur throughout \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nmuch of the time series and therefore appear to be characteristic periods of oscillation at this \n\nvolcano. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7. Wavelet transforms of MOD* time series for a) Erta \u2019Ale, b) K?lauea and c) \n\nKliuchevskoi. Shown are i) the original MOD* time series and ii) its wavelet power spectrum. Time \n\nslices of the power spectrum (shown in Fig. 4.8) are depicted here using dashed white lines.   \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\nFigure 4.8. Time slices of wavelet power against period. \n\n  \n\n   K?lauea displays strong periodicity at a period of 2.5 years with maximum power of this \n\nfeature occurring around October 2006 (Fig. 4.7bii). This long period signal is overlain at \n\ndifferent times with shorter period oscillations. Time slices 3 and 4 (Fig. 4.8) display some of the \n\nmultiple periodicity components in the K?lauea power spectrum. The long  (i.e. 2.5 year) period \n\nis the dominant feature in these time slices however both also show periodicity at around 1/4 of a \n\nyear and at 2 days. Time slice 3 also shows a peak in periodicity at around 1 year which is \n\nequivalent to the duration of the overall waxing and waning in radiance in the corresponding time \n\nseries (Fig. 4.7bi). A strong low period oscillation (i.e. 2.6 days) in the power spectrum occurs \n\nduring a short sharp peak in MOD* values around July 2008. \n\n  The four major eruptive episodes at Kliuchevskoi dominate both the time series and the \n\nwavelet power spectrum (Fig. 4.7cii). The three symmetric events each show a waxing and \n\nwaning of measured radiance with a periodicity of approximately 0.25 to 0.5 years (e.g., time \n\nslice 5 in Fig. 4.8). The maximum periodicity event (i.e. power = 1) for Kliuchevskoi is displayed \n\nin time slice 5 (i.e., period = 3.5 days;  centred on the 31\nst\n May 2007). It occurred at the same \n\ntime that a new lava flow was reported to have moved down the East flank of the volcano \n\n(BGVN 2007). Periodicity during the episode with more persistent Strombolian activity (i.e., \n\ntime slice 6) displays more clearly separated peaks in period at 2.5, 16.5, 47 and 204 days. The \n\nfairly regular spacing (i.e., repose) of the last three eruptive episodes resulted in a 1.5 year \n\nperiodicity centred around the turn of 2009.  \n\n \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n4.7.  Discussion \n\n \n\nThe MODIS and ASTER sensors provide datasets with their own particular advantages and \n\ndisadvantages. MODIS channel 21 will very rarely saturate, even over hot volcanic targets, and \n\ncan therefore be reliably used to provide a measure of volcanic thermal radiation if the target is \n\nhot and/or large enough. The daily revisit time of the MODIS sensor also allows dynamic \n\nvolcanic events to be characterized in relatively high temporal detail. This sampling frequency \n\ncould be improved further still, if necessary, by inclusion of data from the other MODIS sensor \n\n(i.e., on the Aqua satellite) as might be of critical importance during a volcanic crisis. The higher \n\nspatial resolution of the ASTER sensor, on the other hand, allows the spatial characteristics of \n\nthermal anomalies to be quantified more accurately and also facilitates the detection of subtle \n\nthermal anomalies. These capabilities permitted the identification of a thermal precursor to lava \n\nflows at Kliuchevskoi. Unfortunately the probability of ASTER capturing such precursors events \n\nis limited by the fact that it is not a mapping mission (i.e. does not acquire data continuously).  \n\n The low spatial resolution of MODIS leaves the sensor incapable of monitoring the type \n\nof thermal activity expressed by L\u00e1scar during the study period (i.e., predominantly fumarolic).  \n\nThere are plenty of other (potentially hazardous) volcanoes around the world that are similarly \n\ndifficult for MODIS to monitor. Fortunately ASTER can provide a complimentary dataset that, \n\nwhen used in conjunction with MODIS datasets, has a better overall temporal, spatial and \n\nradiometric resolution. This can be used to obtain more information on a greater range of \n\nvolcanic activity than either sensor could offer individually. \n\n This is the first time to our knowledge that wavelet analysis has been applied over such a \n\nlong (i.e., 11 year) data set of volcanic radiance. This enabled us to identify oscillations on \n\nweekly, monthly and yearly time scales. Very short period events (i.e., a few days) can be created \n\nby a burst of thermal activity such as from a short lived lava flow or lava fountain. It is possible, \n\nhowever, that similar oscillations in radiance - as seen from space - might also occur due to \n\nchanges in cloud cover over a thermally stable target. Very short period events should therefore \n\nbe interpreted with care and scenes should be inspected for cloud cover.  \n\n Long period events could be better resolved if the overall time series were more \n\nextensive. This reflects the need for continuous collections of data over multiple years and, \n\neventually, decades. Fortunately the next generation of high temporal resolution polar-orbiting \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nsatellites are coming through (i.e., Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP), \n\nSentinel 3, and the Global Change Observation Mission climate change series (GCOM - C)). \n\nWavelet analysis provides new constraints on the probability of the duration and repose of future \n\nevents, and could be used as input into decision making tools such as the Bayesian event tree \n\nmodel for eruption forecasting, i.e., BET EF (Marzocchi et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n4.8. Conclusion \n\n \n\nThis study investigated a collection of 11 year time series of MODIS and ASTER thermal \n\nanomalies (i.e., using the metrics MOD* and AST*, respectively) at four different volcanoes. \n\nMOD* measures the radiance emitted by a volcano and AST* measures the size of thermally \n\nanomalous areas.  This is the first time (to our knowledge) that two sensors of this type have been \n\nused to compare such long time series of the intensity and size of thermal anomalies. We show \n\npractical examples of the relative strengths of each sensor and how they can be used to improve \n\noverall understanding of volcanic activity at a number of distinctly different volcanoes.  \n\n The high temporal resolution MOD* metric was also analyzed using continuous wavelet \n\ntransforms. Given the length of the time series it was possible to determine periods over which \n\nthermal activity waxes and wanes at a particular volcano as well as to characterize repose time \n\nbetween thermal events. This might be useful in guiding forecasts on the duration and onset of \n\nfuture eruptions. It also facilitates the comparison of the time scales over which different \n\nvolcanoes erupt. The AST* metric allowed the size of thermal anomalies to be determined in \n\nrelatively high detail, it also facilitate the detection of subtle thermal anomalies, both of these \n\ncharacteristics led to the identification of a thermal precursor to lava flow at Kliuchevskoi. It is \n\nuseful, therefore, to explore synergies between high temporal and high spatial resolution datasets. \n\n Time series plots, images and movies can be thought of as volcano monitoring products. \n\nThese products could be made automatically and provided free of charge to volcano observatories \n\nand other interested parties. This would increase the science return from existing and future \n\nmissions, raise the global profile of the space agency or corporation that provides the data and \n\nalso contribute positively to society, especially to those at risk from volcanic hazards, be it either \n\ndirectly (e.g., local inhabitants) or indirectly (e.g., airplane passengers and international \n\nbusinesses). \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 5 \n\n \n\nCalculating Radiant Flux from Thermally Mixed Pixels \n\n \n\n \n\nS. W. Murphy, C. Oppenheimer , C.R. de Souza Filho \n\nTo be submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing \n\n \n\n \n\n5.1. Abstract \n\n \n\nVolcanic activity involves the transfer of hot material to the Earth's surface. This can be \n\nmonitored on a global scale from space using infrared imagers on board satellites. However, \n\nsurface temperature gradients at volcanoes, as well as other natural heat sources such as fires and \n\ngeothermal fields, typically change significantly on the scale of a single pixel footprint (i.e. the \n\narea subtended by the instantaneous field of view of a single detector element). Consequently a \n\npixel footprint will contain multiple thermal components over such heat sources. This paper \n\nexplores the calculation of radiant flux from thermally mixed pixels through model fitting of \n\nspectral radiance. This is achieved using a new approach based on spectral libraries (i.e. a \n\ncollection of the radiance spectra that might be measured over active terrestrial heat sources). \n\nTwo spectral libraries were built. One for short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging spectrometers, \n\nsuch as those that are currently in orbit or about to be launched (e.g. Hyperion, EnMap, Hisui), \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\nand another for imaging spectrometers with SWIR, mid infrared (MIR) and thermal infrared \n\n(TIR) channels, representing data that might be collected from a future class of imaging \n\nspectrometers (e.g. HypsIRI). Spectral radiance can be modelled to within 3% for spectrometers \n\nwith just SWIR channels and to within 5 % for those with SWIR, MIR and TIR channels. We \n\nsuggest that this is within the accuracy to which spectral radiance can be reliably measured from \n\nspace over hot volcanic targets. Radiant flux SWIR spectrometers can be measured to within \n\n20%; this is an improvement over existing methods. In contrast SWIR-MIR-TIR spectrometers \n\nought to be able to measure radiant flux to within 1%. We infer that it might not be possible to \n\nreliably resolve the number, size and temperature of subpixel components from spectral \n\ninformation alone, and therefore suggest that radiant flux and radiant exitance are more reliable \n\nand accurate measures of thermal activity as seen from space. A practical example of our \n\napproach is demonstrated using Hyperion images of a lava flow from Kliuchevskoi volcano \n\n(Russia) in 2007. The upcoming generation of orbital spectrometers offers an opportunity to \n\nimplement the proposed algorithms operationally. \n\n \n\n5.2. Introduction \n\n \n\nVolcanism is driven by heat transfer from the planet's interior to its surface. Satellites can \n\nmonitor this fundamental driving force by measuring radiance from volcanic surfaces. Planck\u2019s \n\nlaw describes the relationship between spectral radiance, temperature and wavelength which, \n\nwhen modified to account for spectral emissivity, can be expressed as follows: \n\n \n\n       (5.1) \n\n \n\nwhere  L( ,T)   is  spectral  radiance  (W m\n-2\n\n sr\n-1\n\n ?m\n-1\n)  as  a function  of wavelength  ( ) and  \n\ntemperature (T), ?  is spectral emissivity, and c1 and c2 are the radiation constants (i.e., c1 = 2hc\n2\n \n\n= 1.19?10\n-16\n\n W m\n2\n sr\n\n-1\n and c2 = hc/k = 1.439?10\n\n-2\n m K; where h is the Planck constant, c the speed \n\nof light and k the Boltzmann constant). To obtain a better understanding of conditions at the \n\ntarget surface it is often desirable to convert radiance into units that represent more tangible \n\ncharacteristics of the volcano, e.g., surface temperature distribution or radiated heat output in \n\nWatts. This facilitates monitoring of changes in thermal budgets over time and comparing \n\n\n\n95 \n \n\nactivity between different volcanoes (e.g. Glaze et al. 1989). Metrics of radiant heat output \n\ninclude radiant flux, ?, which is the rate of photon energy transfer (i.e. Watts), and radiant \n\nexitance, Q, which is a measure of radiant flux from a given surface (i.e. Watts per metre \n\nsquared). The Stefan-Boltzmann law relates the radiant exitance from an isothermal surface to its \n\ntemperature: \n\n \n\n          (5.2) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is emissivity, ? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.67 10\n-8\n\n W m\n-2\n\n K\n-4\n\n ), and T is \n\ntemperature in Kelvin. The temperature of an isothermal surface can be obtained from spectral \n\nradiance by rearranging (5.1) appropriately. \n\n \n\n        (5.3) \n\n \n\nHowever, in a volcano monitoring context, it is usually not valid to assume that a surface will be \n\nisothermal at the pixel scale. Thus radiance that reaches a single detector element of a sensor is \n\ncomprised of a mixture of contributions from a continuous temperature distribution that can, at \n\nsome point, be discretised (i.e. be assumed to be composed of n isothermal components) for the \n\npurposes of modelling with negligible impact on the derived quantities. The radiant flux from an \n\narea can therefore be described as follows: \n\n \n\n         (5.4) \n\n \n\nwhere A is the size of a pixel footprint, whilst fn and Tn are the fractional area and temperature of \n\nthe n\nth\n\n subpixel thermal component. The aim of this work is to improve methods for calculating \n\nradiant flux for thermally mixed pixels. We also examine the feasibility of resolving the number, \n\ntemperature and fractional area of individual subpixel components. These metrics are used in a \n\nrange of disciplines including: volcanology, fire monitoring and geothermal exploration. \n\n \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\n5.3. Existing methods for calculating radiant flux \n\n \n\nHot volcanic features such as lava flows and fumaroles are often several hundreds of degrees \n\nhotter than the ambient background temperature, and display continuous temperature \n\ndistributions, with thermal gradients reaching up to and beyond 500 \no\nC m\n\n-1\n (e.g. Oppenheimer et \n\nal. 1993b, Wright and Flynn 2003). The surface temperatures of such features can therefore \n\nchange dramatically over the length scale of one metre. Yet high spatial resolution imagers with \n\nwavebands sensitive to volcanic heating (i.e. 2 - 12 ?m; 100 - 1200 \no\nC) have pixel sizes on the \n\norder of 30 \u2013 60 m. It is therefore likely that these active heat sources will be far from isothermal \n\nat the pixel scale. This is called the thermal mixing problem and a number of methodologies have \n\nbeen proposed to tackle it. \n\n \n\n5.3.1. Dozier Technique. \n\n \n\nThe first published attempts to determine the temperature and size of subpixel thermal \n\ncomponents were provided by Matson and Dozier (1981) and Dozier (1981). They assumed just \n\ntwo thermal components in a thermally mixed pixel. This allowed them to use a MIR and a TIR \n\nchannel from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to define and then \n\nsolve for the following simultaneous equations: \n\n \n\n       (5.5) \n\n \n\n       (5.6) \n\n \n\nwhere L is spectral radiance, f is fractional area, x and y denote different wavebands and the \n\nsubscripts hot and cold denote relative temperature. There are two equations and three unknowns \n\n(i.e. a fractional area and two temperatures). Solutions to these simultaneous equations require \n\nthat one of the unknowns can be assumed a priori. This technique was developed for fire \n\nmonitoring purposes but is extendable generally to any situation where thermally mixed pixels \n\noccur. It became known as the 'bi-spectral method' in the fire monitoring community and the \n\n'dual-band technique' within the volcano monitoring community after being adopted by Rothery \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\net al. (1988). Of course, with more distinct sensor channels, multicomponent models can be \n\nevaluated (e.g. Oppenheimer, 1993a). Once subpixel characteristics (i.e. number, temperature and \n\nsize of subpixel components) have been obtained it is possible to calculate radiant flux using \n\nequation 5.4 (e.g. Glaze et al. 1989) \n\n Although used extensively in different fields, the Dozier technique does not provide a \n\nreliable measure of the subpixel characteristics from natural heat sources. This is in part due to \n\nthe sensitivity of simultaneous equation solutions to the required a priori assumption (e.g. \n\nOppenheimer et al. 1993b). However, when more than two spectral channels are available it is \n\npossible to avoid making such assumptions (e.g. Flynn et al. 1993). The principal reason that the \n\nDozier technique cannot be reliably used to obtain subpixel characteristics is that the continuous \n\ntemperature distribution of volcanic thermal features is not well characterized by just two or three \n\nthermal components, be they fumaroles (e.g. Oppenheimer et al. 1993b) or lava flows (e.g. \n\nWright &amp; Flynn 2003). Furthermore there is a tacit assumption that all subpixel areas are \n\nradiating significantly (i.e. the sum of subpixel fractional areas is unity). This is not valid in the \n\ncase that the method uses just SWIR wavelengths, as ambient background surfaces (i.e. &lt;100\no\nC) \n\nwill not radiate significantly in this wavelength region. An analysis of the accuracy of the  Dozier \n\ntechnique revealed that, even if an active surface could be assumed to be composed of just two \n\nthermal components, the 'best possible' retrieval of temperatures and fractional areas were only to \n\nwithin \u00b1 100 \no\nC and 0.5 at one standard deviation (Giglio &amp; Kendall 2001). Despite these \n\nshortcomings the methodology continues to be used to make semi-quantitative inferences about \n\nsubpixel characteristics of thermally mixed pixels (e.g. Lombardo et al. 2006, Vaughan et al. \n\n2010, Blackett &amp; Wooster 2011). \n\n \n\n5.3.2 Wooster Technique \n\n \n\nWooster et al. (2003) developed a method for determining radiant flux from thermally mixed \n\npixels using a single mid-infrared channel without the need to assume subpixel characteristics. It \n\nwas based on the fact that the Planck function (equation 5.1) can be approximated using a power \n\nlaw within limited temperature and wavelength ranges. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n98 \n \n\n          (5.7) \n\n \n\nwhere a and b are empirically derived constants. At a wavelength of around 4 ?m and \n\ntemperature range of approximately 300 - 1200 \no\nC the exponent, b, also has a value of around 4. \n\nThus, under these wavelength and temperature conditions, equation 7 approximates the Stefan-\n\nBoltzmann law (i.e. equation 2). This allows the following linear relationship between radiance \n\nand radiant flux to be derived. \n\n \n\n         (5.8) \n\n \n\nwhere c is a sensor specific empirically derived constant, L is the radiance measured from a 4 ?m \n\nchannel and Lbkgd is the background radiance in that channel. Background radiance is typically \n\nestimated from neighbouring 'ambient' pixels. This allowed radiant flux from hot targets to be \n\nestimated to within \u00b1 30% (Wooster et al. 2003). The approach was later adopted by the volcano \n\nmonitoring community for monitoring radiant flux from all of the Earth's subaerially erupting \n\nvolcanoes over a seven year period (Wright &amp; Pilger 2008) and to create a twelve year time series \n\nof radiant flux from Stromboli volcano (Coppola et al. 2012). \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Model-fitting Approach \n\n \n\nImaging spectrometers acquire a radiance spectra for each pixel location; these spectra  can be \n\nmodelled as follows: \n\n \n\n        (5.9) \n\n \n\nwhere Ln( ) is the total spectral radiance from n subpixel thermal components at a given \n\nwavelength  , ?  is spectral emissivity, fi and Ti are the fractional area and temperature of the i\nth\n\n \n\ncomponent, and L( ,T) is blackbody radiance at Ti. Emissivity spectra are assumed to be \n\nidentical for all subpixel components within a given pixel footprint; which ought to be valid in \n\nthe majority of volcano monitoring cases.  \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\n It is therefore possible to obtain subpixel characteristics from hyperspectral images by \n\nmodel fitting. Oppenheimer et al. (1993c) achieved this using the simplex algorithm to resolve \n\ntwo thermal component solutions from hot volcanic surfaces imaged by the Airborne \n\nVisible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). Wright and Flynn (2003) evaluated equation \n\n5.9 using a Levenberg-Marquardt gradient solver. This allowed the optimal number of subpixel \n\nsolutions to be found automatically. They found that just two or three components were typically \n\nrequired to find a reliable flux estimate (i.e. one that did not change as the number of modelled \n\nthermal components increased). \n\n \n\n5.4. Reliability of Radiant Flux estimates \n\n \n\nHere we provide an explanation as to why radiant flux can be reliably obtained with simple \n\nthermal component models (i.e. just two or three components) even though such models do not \n\nreliably represent the number, temperature or fractional area of subpixel components. The \n\nintegral of the Planck function (i.e. equation 1) with respect to wavelength is radiant exitance \n\n(equation 5.2). Radiant exitance is therefore equivalent to the region under the graph of spectral \n\nradiance. This is directly proportional to radiant flux by the factor of a surface area (i.e. in this \n\ncase the area of a pixel). Therefore to calculate radiant flux all that is required is to be able to \n\ndetermine the region under a graph of spectral radiance and know the pixel size of the detector. \n\nThe direct approach to solve the integral of spectral radiance would involve making a sufficiently \n\ncontinuous number of spectral measurements. Unfortunately this is not possible due to \n\natmospheric absorption. Therefore it is necessary to fit a model to the parts of the spectrum that \n\nwe can measure. It is not really relevant whether the subpixel characteristics used in a model are \n\nthemselves accurate with regards to accurately calculating radiant flux. All that matters is that the \n\narea under the radiance spectrum is well characterized. This can be achieved by using a relatively \n\nsimple thermal model. \n\nFor any given model of a measured radiance spectrum the curve-fitting accuracy will \n\nalways be lower than the area-fitting accuracy. That is, the proportional difference between the \n\nmeasured and the modelled curve will be higher than the proportional difference between the \n\nmeasured and modelled areas under those curves. Radiant flux estimates require good area-fitting \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\naccuracy, conversely subpixel characterization requires good curve-fitting accuracy. Whether or \n\nnot such a level of curve-fitting accuracy is practically obtainable is discussed later. \n\n There is a multitude of ways of fitting a model to a data set. Using a gradient solver is one \n\nof them. Here we suggest an approach that is based on a spectral library. This offers notable \n\nadvantages over the gradient solver approach: i) it will always converge towards (i.e. find) a \n\nsolution, ii) it will always find the global minimum (i.e. the best solution that it is capable of \n\nfinding) and iii) it is less computationally expensive (i.e. as solutions need only be called from \n\nmemory), thus making them particularly well suited for calculations on board remote sensing \n\nplatforms. \n\n \n\n5.5. A Spectral Library Approach \n\n \n\nA spectral library, in this piece of work, is defined as a collection of radiance spectra that \n\nrepresent the possible range that might be measured by an orbital imaging spectrometer when \n\nacquiring data over an active volcano. Spectral libraries can be used to fit models to measured \n\nradiance spectra by finding the best match in the library to the measured data. Two classes of \n\nspectral library were created. They correspond to the two classes of orbital imaging spectrometers \n\nconsidered in this study i) those which have only SWIR channels and ii) those with SWIR, MIR \n\nand TIR channels. The first represents the wavelength ranges of existing, or soon to be in orbit, \n\nimaging spectrometers such as Hyperion, EnMap and Hisui. The second represents a future class \n\nof sensors such as the HyspIRI mission, which is currently being considered for development by \n\nNASA (e.g. Hook &amp; Oaida 2010). These two categories will be referred to as i) current-class and \n\nii) future-class for the remainder of this article. The wavebands used to create each library are \n\nassumed to be well represented by a single central wavelength (Table 5.1). The wavebands of the \n\ncurrent-class library correspond to Hyperion channels whilst those for the future-class of sensor \n\nare based on proposed HyspIRI channels (Hook &amp; Oaida 2010). \n\nThe current-class of sensors has a pixel size of 30 m. The future-class has a larger pixel \n\nsize, i.e. 60 m, as has been proposed for the HyspIRI sensor in order to ensure high signal to \n\nnoise ratios in the TIR bands. A three component thermal model was used to create the library \n\nspectra. The size of subpixel thermal components is measured in fractions of a pixel area. The \n\nfractional areas used to create the libraries range from 0.0025 to 0.95 for the current-class, and \n\n\n\n101 \n \n\n0.00028 to 0.9992 for the future-class. The sum of subpixel components was not forced to be \n\nunity for the current-class library (i.e. because components lower than approximately 100 \no\nC will \n\nnot radiate significantly in the SWIR) but it was for the future-class library (i.e. because TIR \n\nwavelengths will be sensitive to the radiance emitted by non-active background surfaces). \n\nIncrements in fractional area were not constant but instead were smallest at the lowest fractional \n\nareas and increased in size at larger fractional areas. This significantly reduced the size of each \n\nlibrary and therefore increased the speed of library searches. The temperatures of thermal \n\ncomponents used to make the library spectra ranged from  100 to 1110 \no\nC for the current-class, \n\nand -30 to 1105 \no\nC for the future-class. Cooler thermal components were included in the future-\n\nclass library because such surfaces will emit significant amounts of radiance at TIR wavelengths. \n\nThere were 1.0 x 10\n7\n spectra overall in the current-class library and 1.6 x 10\n\n7\n in the future-class \n\nlibrary.  \n\n \n\nTable 5.1.

Monte Carlo testing \n\n \n\nThe number of possible spectra that an imaging spectrometer could measure is extremely large. It \n\nis therefore not possible to exhaustively test a methodology for calculating radiant flux against all \n\npossible spectra that could be measured in practice. We therefore test the ability of each spectral \n\nlibrary at calculating radiant flux using a Monte Carlo approach. This involves executing a large \n\nnumber of random trials. We used 2, 3, 4 and 5 component thermal models to create Monte Carlo \n\nruns (i.e. random test spectra). One million such spectra were created for each thermal component \n\nmodel and for each library. We found the results to be stable at this number of runs (i.e. they \n\nwere consistent even for different sets of random test spectra). Monte Carlo runs were created \n\nusing the following constraints. Temperatures were allowed to float freely between 0 - 1100 \no\nC \n\nalthough individual thermal components were forced to be at least  50 \no\nC apart so that higher \n\ncomponent models did not inadvertently become lower component models. Surfaces above 900 \n\no\nC could occupy no more than 0.1of a pixel and those above 700 \n\no\nC no more than 0.2, so as to \n\nreflect realistic temperature distributions over volcanic targets (Wright et al. 2011). Fractional \n\nareas could float freely between 0 and 1. The sum of fractional areas was forced to be unity for \n\nthe future-class test spectra but not for the current-class. Finally Monte Carlo runs for the current-\n\nclass were forced to exhibit a radiance of at least 5 W m\n-2\n\n sr\n-1\n\n ?m\n-1\n\n at a wavelength of 2.24 ?m in \n\norder to mimic the requirements of a simple anomalous pixel detection algorithm in the SWIR. \n\nThe accuracy to which a library spectra were fit to a Monte Carlo run was measured using the \n\nmean absolute proportional difference (MAPD) between the two: \n\n \n\n         (5.10) \n\n \n\nwhere a is actual radiance (i.e. the Monte Carlo run) and o is optimal radiance (i.e. the best fitting \n\nlibrary spectra) in the i\nth\n\n channel of a spectrum which has n wavebands in total. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n103 \n \n\n5.7. Hyperion data processing \n\n \n\nThe Earth Observing 1 (EO-1) satellite forms part of the New Millennium Program. The \n\nHyperion instrument on board EO-1 is the first ever orbital imaging spectrometer. It consists of \n\nVNIR and SWIR subsystems that together provide 242 channels, 196 of which are unique and \n\ncalibrated. Spectral coverage ranges from 400 to 2500 nm at a resolution of 10 nm. The spatial \n\nresolution of each pixel is 30 m. The swath width of a scene is 7.7 km which translates into a \n\nnominal temporal resolution of 200 days. However, the spacecraft can be programmed to roll to \n\nvarious pointing angles allowing data to be acquired up to 5 times in a 16 day period. Automated \n\nacquisition requests of Hyperion data over volcanic targets can occur when activity (e.g. thermal, \n\nseismic, etc.) is detected by NASA's Volcano Sensor Web, which includes a collection of orbital \n\nand ground-based sensors (Davies et al. 2006). Radiometric quantization of Hyperion data is 12 \n\nbits and an entire image is collected in around 30 seconds. Raw digital numbers (DN) are \n\nconverted into radiance using the following scale factors. \n\n \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n  (for Hyperion bands 1 - 70)       (5.11) \n\n \n\n   \n  \n\n  \n  (for Hyperion bands 71-242)      (5.12) \n\n \n\nwhere L  is spectral radiance (in W m\n2\n sr\n\n-1\n ?m\n\n-1\n) and DN is the digital number in the relevant \n\nHyperion channel.  \n\n The nine channels used to calculate radiant flux (Table 1) were selected to ensure \n\nsufficient coverage across the measured spectrum for accurate model fitting and to guarantee that \n\nat least a few unsaturated bands were available even over the hottest target surfaces.  Strong \n\natmospheric water absorption features at 1400 and 1900 nm were avoided. When calculating \n\nradiant flux saturated pixel values were automatically avoided using the flag file in the level 1 \n\ndata product. All images in our dataset were acquired at night, it was therefore not necessary to \n\ncorrect for reflected solar radiation. The emissivity of the target surface was set to 0.95. The \n\nresulting radiance spectra were used to calculated radiant flux by finding the best match within \n\nthe SWIR spectral library. \n\n \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\n5.8. Results \n\n \n\n5.8.1. Monte Carlo Runs \n\n \n\nThe spectral fit (i.e. MAPD) between Monte Carlo runs and the respective libraries are very \n\ngood, i.e. to within 3% for the current sensor class library and 5% for the future sensor class \n\nlibrary (Fig. 5.1). The figure shows a cumulative histogram of spectral fit for each thermal \n\ncomponent model, i.e. 2,3,4 and 5 components, using red, green, blue and brown lines \n\nrespectively. The spectral fits for the current class library are somewhat more accurate, i.e. tend \n\nto cumulate towards unity at lower MAPD values (Fig. 5.1). This is because they only have to fit \n\nthe SWIR region of a spectrum whilst the future class library has to fit the SWIR, MIR and TIR \n\nregions collectively. However the spectral fit from both libraries is more accurate than the degree \n\nto which radiance can be reliably measured from space when imaging an active volcano (see \n\ndiscussion). Thus the accuracy of the following retrievals for radiant flux and subpixel \n\ncharacteristics can be considered to be at or beyond the practical detection limit of existing or \n\nnear future orbital sensors.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1. The spectral fit of Monte Carlo runs for libraries of a) current-class sensors and \n\nb) future-class sensors. These cumulative histograms are displayed using red, green, blue \n\nand brown lines for 2, 3, 4 and 5 component Monte Carlo runs, respectively. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2a shows that the radiant flux from current class of sensors can be measured to within \n\n\u00b1 20 %. This is an improvement over the \u00b1 30 % of the Wooster technique (Wooster et al. 2003). \n\nConversely, radiant flux from future-class sensors can be measured to within \u00b1 1 % (Fig. 5.2b). \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\nThe dramatic increase in accuracy of the future-class sensors is due to the extra spectral \n\ninformation they provide.  \n\n Notably both sensor systems show that a spectral library built using a 3-component \n\nthermal model is capable of measuring radiant flux for a range of subpixel characteristics (i.e. \n\nfrom 2 to 5 distinct thermal components) with similar degrees of accuracy (Fig. 5.2).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2. Accuracy of radiant flux measurements. Cumulative histograms for the current-\n\nclass library are shown in red, green, blue and brown for 2, 3, 4 and 5 component Monte \n\nCarlo runs, respectively. The histograms for the future-class library fit within the black \n\nregion. \n\n \n\n The ability for the 3-component spectral libraries to accurately determine subpixel \n\ncharacteristics can be directly explored using the corresponding 3-component Monte Carlo runs. \n\nThe accuracy of temperature retrievals for these three components, i.e. maximum, middle and \n\nminimum temperatures, are depicted using red, green and blue lines, respectively (Fig. 5.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3. The accuracy of subpixel temperatures characterization for a) the current-class \n\nlibrary and b) the future-class library. These cumulative histograms display the deviation \n\nof model maximum (red), middle (green) and minimum (blue) temperatures from the \n\nactual value. \n\n \n\n Maximum temperatures are relatively more accurate from the current sensor library (Fig. \n\n5.3a), i.e. they can be reliably constrained to within about 150 \no\nC. Overall however thermal \n\ncomponents are poorly constrained for both classes of sensor, with temperature estimates only \n\nreliably obtained to within 300 \no\nC of the actual value for all thermal components. \n\nThe accuracy to which fractional areas can be estimated is plotted in Figure 5.4. \n\nMaximum, middle and minimum areas are depicted using red, green and blue lines respectively. \n\nMinimum fractional area estimates are somewhat more accurate for the current class of sensors. \n\nAgain, however, these subpixel characteristics are poorly constrained.  Fractional areas can only \n\nbe reliably defined to within 40% of the pixel size for both sensor classes. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4. The accuracy of subpixel fractional areas for a) the current-class library and b) \n\nthe future-class library. These cumulative histograms display the deviation of model \n\nmaximum (red), middle (green) and minimum (blue) fractional areas from the actual value. \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\n \n\n Thus unless spectral radiance can be measured and modelled to within an accuracy of \n\ngreater than 3% for the current-class sensors and 5% for the future-class sensors, it is not possible \n\nto reliably measure subpixel characteristics accurately from spectral information alone. This has \n\nsignificant repercussions for any methodology that attempts to resolve subpixel characteristics \n\nfrom multispectral or hyperspectral imagery. We therefore suggest that radiant flux estimates are \n\nsignificantly more accurate and reliable measures of thermal volcanic activity and should be \n\ngiven preference over attempting to resolve subpixel characteristics. \n\n \n\n5.8.2. Radiant Flux from a Lava Flow at Kliuchevskoi, Russia \n\n \n\nKliuchevskoi began an eruptive episode on the 15 February 2007 with the onset of Strombolian \n\nactivity (BGVN 2007). Three Hyperion images were acquired during the ensuing episode on the \n\n18 April, 22 May and 13 June 2007. Radiant flux [W] and radiant exitance [W m\n-2\n\n] maps were \n\ncalculated from these scenes using a spectral library approach. Also provided for each scene are: \n\ntotal radiant flux (?total) in megawatts [MW], average radiant exitance (i.e. Qmean) in watts per \n\nmetre squared [W m\n-2\n\n], and the size of thermally anomalous areas (A) in thousands of metres \n\nsquared [1000's m\n2\n]. \n\n During this episode the volcano displayed a variety of eruptive products. including: \n\nStrombolian eruptions, lava flows on the NW and E flanks, fumarolic activity, mudflows, \n\nfrequent gas-and-steam plumes as well as ash plumes (i.e. up to about 8 km in height and \n\nextending 2000 km from the volcano) and Vulcanian eruptions (Vencke 2002-). \n\n The first scene (Fig. 5.5i) is coincident with Strombolian activity in the crater and \n\nincreased fumarolic activity (BGVN 2007). It displays the maximum average radiant exitance \n\nwithin these scenes due to the hot, spatially limited output from fresh Strombolian activity. \n\nThermal activity is still constrained to the active crater at this time. The second scene (Fig. 5.5ii) \n\nis concurrent with lava flow down the N flank of the volcano and shows the greatest overall \n\nradiant flux due to the relatively extensive and hot flow surface. Smaller flow fronts are visible \n\nand are orientated to the NNW and SE. This image was acquired during a phase of Vulcanian \n\neruptions that occurred on the 11, 16 and 22-24 May. The final scene on the 13th June (Fig 5.5iii) \n\nshows the radiant flux from a different lava flow that began descending the SE flank of the \n\n\n\n108 \n \n\nvolcano on the 31 May (BGVN 2007), i.e. 2 weeks before the image was acquired. It shows the \n\nlowest average radiant exitance signifying that it was cooler than the previous flows at the time of \n\nacquisition. The axis of this flow is cooler than the margins. Strong phreatic bursts were seen \n\nfrom the front of the lava flow during interaction with glacial ice (BGVN 2007). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5.

Discussion \n\n \n\nThere are a number of reasons why measurements of radiance emitted from volcanoes are not \n\nperfectly accurate. They include: i) the point spread function of a detector element extending \n\nbeyond the nominal pixel size of a sensor, ii) hysteresis in a sensor system along a scan line over \n\nhot target, iii) imperfect atmospheric corrections (especially in the presence of volcanic fumes \n\nand/or aerosols, as well as the difficulty in constraining reflected atmospheric irradiance in \n\ndaytime scenes), iv) spectral emissivity corrections (i.e. which depend on composition and \n\nsurface roughness, and therefore age of the target area, as well as wavelength and potentially \n\ntemperature; furthermore emissivity might not always be homogenous at the subpixel scale), v) \n\ninaccuracies in the geolocation overlap between different wavebands, vi) the non-instantaneous \n\namount of time over which radiance is collected, vi) sensor noise, and vii) the spectral width of \n\nindividual channels. The majority of these issues apply in other applications where radiance \n\nemitted from a terrestrial target is measured from space (e.g. fire monitoring and geothermal \n\nexploration). \n\nTherefore, although in theory a more detailed spectral library could provide a better \n\nspectral fit and therefore flux estimate, in practice it would not. This is because the model fitting \n\naccuracy already equals or exceeds the accuracy to which volcanic, geothermal or fire-based \n\nradiance can be measured from space. The reason that accurate radiant flux estimates are \n\nrelatively easy to obtain whilst accurate subpixel characteristics are not is because the two require \n\nvery different amounts of model fitting accuracy. Relatively small spectral differences can signify \n\na large change in temperature or fractional area of subpixel components; whereas the \n\ncorresponding change in the area under the radiance spectra will remain small. \n\n \n\n5.10. Conclusion \n\n \n\nWe have shown that it is possible to use spectral libraries to calculate radiant flux from space for \n\nefficient on-the-fly processing. This method is transferable to field based or airborne sensors. The \n\nability to reliably resolve the temperature and area of subpixel components in thermally mixed \n\npixels would require that spectral radiance be both measured and modelled to within 3 - 5% \n\naccuracy. Given the sources of error inherent in measurements of spectral radiance from volcanic, \n\n\n\n110 \n \n\nand other natural thermally emitting targets (e.g. fires and geothermal area), it might not be \n\npossible to ever reliably resolve subpixel characteristics using spectral information alone. Even \n\nso, it is still possible to obtain reliable flux estimates, especially when sufficient spectral coverage \n\n(e.g. SWIR, MIR and TIR channels) is available. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6 \n \n\nFuture Prospects and Conclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe principal findings from each study presented in this thesis are outlined below. After which \n\nfuture satellite missions that could be used to monitor thermal volcanic activity from space are \n\ndescribed. Finally the overall conclusions derived from this work are presented. \n\n \n\n \n\n6.1. Recapitulation \n\n \n\nChapter 1 outlined the motivation behind this thesis, the overall objectives of the work, and the \n\nscope of what has been presented. Chapter 2 introduced the fundamental scientific principles of \n\nremote sensing from space using infrared wavelengths, described the past and present orbital \n\nimagers that can be used for this purpose and outlined the work of previous authors in the field. \n\nIssues concerning the state-of-the-art where also highlighted. \n\n Chapter 3 explored the use of different metrics of thermal activity in ASTER scenes and \n\nhow these metrics correlated to eruptive activity. This was carried out for two different volcanic \n\ntargets, i.e. Erebus (Antarctica) and L\u00e1scar (Chile), using a decadal time series of images. The \n\nfirst metric, which was the most widely adopted by previous authors, measures the single hottest \n\npixel temperature. It was shown that this metric produced considerable scatter at Erebus, even \n\nthough radiant output from this volcano is known to be remarkably consistent. This was \n\ninterpreted as being largely due to the difficulty this metric has at reliably describing small hot \n\n\n\n112 \n \n\nfeatures such as lava lakes. On the other hand this single hottest pixel metric was able to produce \n\nmore meaningful insight at L\u00e1scar as thermal anomalies are more spatially extensive and \n\ntypically exhibit lower thermal gradients. Even so, characterizing thermal activity using a single \n\npixel value will inevitably lack spatial information. To be able to distinguish between, for \n\nexample, large cool anomalies and small hot anomalies, a new metric of thermal activity was \n\nintroduced that quantifies the size of low, moderate and high temperature anomalies. This metric \n\nwas more robust against subpixel effects at Erebus and provided more profound insights into \n\nthermal activity at both volcanoes, allowing new thermal precursors to be identified at L\u00e1scar. \n\n Thermal metrics using ASTER's TIR bands typically depend on the definition of a \n\nbackground temperature. It was shown that existing methods for selection of this parameter were \n\nsensitive to the slope and aspect of the volcanic edifice as well as the solar azimuth. A new \n\nmethod for calculating more robust background temperatures was therefore put forward. \n\nAnomalously hot TIR pixels were detected by statistically detecting an abnormal deviation above \n\nthe background temperature. Thermal anomalies in ASTER SWIR bands were also identified. \n\nThis aided in further constraining interpretations of eruptive activity. \n\n Chapter 4 investigated the use of sensors with different temporal and spatial resolutions to \n\nsynergistically characterize thermal volcanic activity. The MODIS and ASTER sensors were \n\nused for this purpose as both are situated on the Terra satellite and therefore provided multiple \n\ncontemporary viewing opportunities. The data sets covered an 11 year time series at four \n\ndistinctly different volcanoes: Erta \u2018Ale (Ethiopia), K?lauea (Hawai'i), L\u00e1scar (Chile) and \n\nKliuchevskoi  (Russia). MODIS was used to measure volcanic radiance and was able to \n\ncharacterize dynamic changes through time as well as to capture ephemeral events. ASTER \n\nconstrained the size, shape, location and orientation of thermal anomalies and was able to detect \n\nrelatively subtle thermal activity. This allowed the size and intensity of thermal anomalies to be \n\ncompared for different styles of volcanism, i.e. lava lake, Hawaiian, Strombolian, Vulcanian and \n\npassive degassing. Wavelet analysis of volcanic radiance, as measured by MODIS, characterized \n\nthe timescales over which individual episodes waxed and waned, as well as the repose between \n\nthem. \n\n Chapter 5 introduced a new method for calculating radiant flux from thermally mixed \n\npixels. It was based on fitting a model to a measured radiance spectrum by finding the best match \n\nin a spectral library. The accuracy and reliability of this approach was tested using a large \n\n\n\n113 \n \n\ncollection of random, synthetic spectra (i.e. Monte Carlo runs). It was shown that model fitting \n\naccuracy was quite high (i.e. 3 - 5 %). The possibility of obtaining the size and temperature of \n\nsubpixel components through model fitting was explored. It was found that neither size nor \n\ntemperature could be reliably constrained, even given the model fitting accuracy. This suggests \n\nthat it might not ever be possible to obtain subpixel characteristics from spectral information \n\nalone. This adds extra significance to metrics that can be obtained reliably, such as radiance, \n\nradiant flux and radiant exitance. \n\n \n\n6.2. Future of infrared sensors \n\n \n\nThe future for infrared monitoring of volcanoes from space is an exciting one. National and \n\nmultinational contributions will provide a greater supply of new, state-of-the-art satellite \n\nsensors. The next generation of state-funded  missions of use in measuring volcanic radiance \n\nfrom space are summarized in Table 6.1.  \n\n \n\nTable 6.1. Up and coming, state-funded satellites of use for infrared volcano monitoring.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\n6.2.1. High Spatial Resolution Missions \n\n \n\nThe Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), which will extend the heritage of the successful \n\nLandsat series of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), was launched \n\nsuccessfully on 11th February 2013. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) are expected to \n\ntake control of LDCM ~100 days after launch, at which point data will become available to all \n\nusers at no cost. Sentinel 2, of the European Space Agency (ESA), will provide high spatial \n\nresolution datasets at remarkably high temporal resolution for its class (i.e. 5 days at the equator \n\nwith up to 2 day repeat visit time when using the emergency pointing mode). The German \n\nAerospace Centre (DLR) will launch the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program \n\n(EnMap) which shall provide an unprecedented number of spectral bands for civilian use and \n\nhave \u00b1 30\no \n\npointing capabilities that will permit revisit times of up to 4 days. The third \n\nAdvanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS - 3) of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency \n\n(JAXA) will contain the Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI) sensor which is seen as a follow-\n\nup to ASTER. It will contain a VNIR multispectral radiometer and a S W I R  hyperspectral \n\nradiometer. \n\n NASA plans to launch the Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission sometime \n\nafter 2020. It is being designed with volcanic applications specifically in mind and, as such, \n\nhas extremely promising specifications. It  is i ntended to  includ e hyperspectral VSW IR \n\nmonitoring capabilities geolocated to multispectral MIR and TIR bands of equal pixel size. The \n\ntemporal resolution of the hyperspectral imagery will be 19 days, whilst the multispectral bands \n\nwill have a 5 day temporal resolution. Data will be collected continuously during day and \n\nnight and will be transmitted via direct broadcast.  \n\n \n\n6.2.2. High Temporal Resolution Missions \n\n \n\nESA will launch Sentinel 3 in 2013. This mission shall include a Sea and Land Surface \n\nTemperature Radiometer (SLSTR) which will emulate MODIS capabilities and provide imagery \n\nwithin 3 hours of acquisition. This minimal latency between radiance reaching the sensor \n\nand data delivery to the end-user is extremely important for real-time volcano monitoring. JAXA \n\nis in the process of executing the Global Change Observation Mission (GCOM) which \n\n\n\n115 \n \n\nconsists of two satellite series. The GCOM - C series are intended for monitoring climate change \n\nand could also prove useful for volcano monitoring given that each system will have a 250 m \n\nSWIR band, two 500 m TIR bands and 2 - 3 day visit period. \n\n Geostationary satellite data is set to be taken to a new level with the launch of GOES - R \n\n(i.e. scheduled for 2015) which shall provide coverage of the Americas. The main Earth \n\nobservation instrument on it will be the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), which will provide 11 \n\nmore channels than previous GOES imagers, 7 of those being in MIR and TIR. It will offer a \n\nstandard geostationary temporal resolution of 15 minutes for the full visible disc, 5 minutes over \n\nthe continental USA and, remarkably, up to 30 seconds over regions of interest. Its spatial \n\nresolution in the IR bands will be two times higher (i.e. 2 km pixels) than previous imagers in this \n\nsatellite series. \n\n \n\n6.2.3. Non-Governmental Satellite Sensors \n\n \n\n Beyond government organizations space is increasingly opening up to new areas of \n\nsociety. The University of Hawaii at Manoa, for example, is currently building a low cost, power \n\nefficient thermal infrared imaging spectrometer, i.e. the Thermal Hyperspectral Imager (THI), \n\nwhich is designed for use on board a micro-satellite bus. This will be achieved by encasing \n\ncommercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products in a pressure vessel, an approach that could allow \n\nmany other academic institutions to build their own satellite sensors. Private firms have been \n\nproviding satellite imagery for decades of course but their cost is typically prohibitive for volcano \n\nmonitoring purposes. However, it might be possible to convince some firms to acquire and share \n\ndata of (at least a few) active volcanoes on a regular basis. This makes for an exciting prospect \n\ngiven the capabilities of some of the planned commercial satellites. For example, DigitalGlobe's \n\nWorldView-3 will provide multispectral imagery with 8 SWIR channels at a temporal resolution \n\nof 1 - 5 days and at a remarkably high spatial resolution of 3.7 m. \n\n \n\n6.2.4. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles \n\n \n\nAerial data is set to become ever more accessible given the rise of accessible COTS unmanned \n\naerial vehicles (UAVs). Advances in UAV technology may even make it possible to obtain \n\ncontinuous collection of low cost data, that is, similar to the role currently played out by satellite \n\n\n\n116 \n \n\nimagers, but with ultrahigh resolution and less atmospheric effects. This would require automatic \n\ntake off and landing capabilities and/or the ability to stay airborne for prolonged periods of time \n\n(i.e. weeks), if the high cost of consistent human interaction is to be avoided. The former could be \n\nachieved using rotor-blade powered vehicles (e.g. helicopters and quadrotors) the latter using \n\natmospherically buoyant aircraft (e.g. blimps and balloons). Ideally UAVs would be stationed \n\npermanently at a target volcano for long time series data collection but their high mobility also \n\nmakes them excellent for emergency response.  \n\n \n\n6.2.5. User demand \n\n \n\nRemote sensing data is becoming an ever greater part of everyday life. Well established websites \n\nnow provide free, user-friendly volcano monitoring products (e.g. those hosted by the University \n\nof Alaska Fairbanks, avo.images.alaska.edu, and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, \n\nmodis.higp.hawaii.edu). As familiarity with such data products increases so will demand. \n\nFurthermore, given the increasing tendency for government organizations to provide satellite data \n\nat no cost to the end user, new approaches to volcano monitoring are likely to arise. For example, \n\napplications for mobile devices could provide data products (e.g. images, movies, time series, \n\netc) directly to interested parties automatically. Increased interconnectedness through technology \n\nmay stimulate further demand for research into automatic volcano monitoring systems and ever \n\nmore intuitive and informative user-friendly products. \n\n \n\n6.3. Conclusions \n\n \n\nThe overall conclusions of this thesis are given below. \n\n \n\ni) Satellites are well placed to observe thermal volcanic activity on a global basis. However, it is \n\nnecessary to use multiple orbital sensors, which collectively cover all infrared wavelengths and \n\nvarious spatial and temporal scales, if the full range of observable volcanic thermal phenomena is \n\nto be monitored. This is because different spectral regions are better suited to imaging targets \n\nwith different temperature distributions. Generally speaking, thermal infrared sensors are more \n\nsensitive to cooler targets, whilst mid infrared and shortwave infrared sensors are relatively \n\n\n\n117 \n \n\nsensitive to hotter targets. Reliable quantitative data can only be acquired within the detection and \n\nsaturation limits of a sensor, whether these limits are reached or not is in part dependent on \n\nspatial resolution. Beyond radiometric considerations, eruptive products themselves occur over \n\nextremely diverse spatial and temporal scales. Thus it is necessary to develop sensor synergies. \n\n \n\nii) Reliable and meaningful metrics are required to quantify thermal activity. Thermal mixing at \n\nthe subpixel scale might exclude the possibility of reliable temperature retrievals given that \n\ninverse modelling of radiance spectra require a measurement reliable beyond that which can be \n\nreliably obtained from volcanic targets. Furthermore, the subpixel models required to execute this \n\nprocess may themselves be overly simplified representations of true surface temperature \n\ndistributions. Alternative measurements such as radiance, radiant flux and exitance, which can be \n\nobtained reliably from thermally heterogeneous targets, are therefore probably superior metrics \n\nfor volcano monitoring purposes and other analogous activities (e.g. the monitoring of fires and \n\ngeothermal areas). \n\n \n\niii) Beyond measuring thermal emissions from an individual pixel it is constructive to think of \n\nthermal anomalies as groups of pixels with collective spatial characteristics. For example, \n\nquantifying the overall size of anomalous areas provides a metric that accounts for all thermally \n\nanomalous pixels, and was shown to facilitate comparisons with field reports. Advances in this \n\ndirection could look to also quantify the shape, location and orientation of thermally active areas \n\nand to analyze these spatial characteristics through time. This could provide information that \n\nmight help to diagnose the cause of such anomalies and the risks they may pose to people and \n\nproperty. \n\n \n\niv) One of the key aims of volcanology is to forecast hazardous events. New thermal precursors \n\nto eruptive events were identified in this thesis using infrared imagery of volcanoes. It is likely \n\nthat others exist. Their discovery would be greatly facilitated by providing such data in a user-\n\nfriendly format that is accessible to those who may not be remote sensing specialists. This would, \n\nfor example, aid advanced time series analysis (e.g. wavelet transforms) to flourish; in turn this \n\ncould be used to supplement other input data in mathematical forecasting tools (e.g. Bayesian \n\nBelief Networks). \n\n\n\n118 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n119 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCap\u00edtulo 6 \n\n \n\nPerspectivas Futuras e Conclus\u00f5es \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUma recapitula\u00e7\u00e3o dos principais desenvolvimentos e conclus\u00f5es espec\u00edficas alcan\u00e7adas nesta \n\ntese \u00e9 fornecida abaixo. Adicionalmente, \u00e9 fornecida uma descri\u00e7\u00e3o dos futuros sat\u00e9lites que \n\npoder\u00e3o ser utilizados para o monitoramento da atividade termal de vulc\u00f5es. Ao final do cap\u00edtulo, \n\nser\u00e3o tecidas conclus\u00f5es gerais derivadas do trabalho como um todo. \n\n \n\n6.1. Recapitula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\n \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 1 foram apresentadas as motiva\u00e7\u00f5es da pesquisa de doutorado, assim como o escopo \n\ne os objetivos gerais da tese. No Cap\u00edtulo 2 foram abordados os princ\u00edpios cient\u00edficos \n\nfundamentais de sensoriamento remoto utilizando comprimentos de onda do infravermelho. \n\nForam ainda descritos os principais sensores orbitais, desativados e em opera\u00e7\u00e3o, utilizados para \n\ndetec\u00e7\u00e3o de radia\u00e7\u00e3o eletromagn\u00e9tica infravermelha, incluindo s\u00ednteses sobre contribui\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nextra\u00eddas da literatura quanto \u00e0 aplica\u00e7\u00e3o desses dados em estudos sobre vulc\u00f5es.   \n\n No Cap\u00edtulo 3 explorou-se o uso de diferentes m\u00e9tricas de atividade t\u00e9rmica em cenas \n\nASTER e como essas m\u00e9tricas est\u00e3o correlacionadas \u00e0 atividade eruptiva. Este trabalho foi \n\nrealizado para dois diferentes alvos vulc\u00e2nicos, i.e. Erebus (Ant\u00e1rtica) e L\u00e1scar (Chile), \n\n\n\n120 \n \n\nutilizando uma s\u00e9rie temporal de imagens adquiridas ao longo de uma d\u00e9cada. A primeira \n\nm\u00e9trica, amplamente adotada na literatura, mede a temperatura mais quente de um pixel \n\nindividual. Quando aplicada ao Erebus, um vulc\u00e3o conhecido por um padr\u00e3o termal notavelmente \n\nconsistente, esta m\u00e9trica produziu uma dispers\u00e3o consider\u00e1vel devido, em grande parte, \u00e0 sua \n\ndificuldade em caracterizar pequenos corpos quentes, como lagos de lava. Por outro lado, essa \n\nm\u00e9trica do pixel mais quente foi mais eficaz na caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da atividade no vulc\u00e3o L\u00e1scar \n\nvisto que, neste alvo, as anomalias t\u00e9rmicas s\u00e3o espacialmente mais extensas e apresentam \n\nmenores gradientes t\u00e9rmicos. Mesmo assim, a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da atividade termal utilizando-se \n\num valor de pixel, inevitavelmente, ocasionar\u00e1 a falta de informa\u00e7\u00e3o espacial. Para abordar esse \n\nassunto e ser capaz, por exemplo, de distinguir entre grandes anomalias relativamente frias e \n\npequenas anomalias relativamente quentes, uma nova m\u00e9trica de atividade t\u00e9rmica foi \n\nintroduzida quantificando o tamanho de anomalias de \u00e1reas com temperatura baixa, moderada e \n\nalta. Esta m\u00e9trica foi mais robusta contra efeitos de subpixel e forneceu informa\u00e7\u00f5es mais \n\nconsistentes sobre a atividade t\u00e9rmica em ambos os vulc\u00f5es, permitindo que novos precursores \n\nt\u00e9rmicos fossem identificados no vulc\u00e3o L\u00e1scar.    \n\nM\u00e9tricas t\u00e9rmicas que utilizam bandas TIR do sensor ASTER tipicamente dependem da \n\ndefini\u00e7\u00e3o de uma temperatura de background. No Capitulo 3 ficou demonstrado que os m\u00e9todos \n\nexistentes para a sele\u00e7\u00e3o dessa temperatura s\u00e3o sens\u00edveis \u00e0 inclina\u00e7\u00e3o e aspecto do edif\u00edcio \n\nvulc\u00e2nico, bem como ao azimute solar. Um novo m\u00e9todo para calcular as temperaturas de \n\nbackground foi desenvolvido. Pixels com assinaturas anomalamente quentes nas imagens das \n\nbandas TIR do ASTER foram detectados por apresentarem um desvio, estatisticamente anormal, \n\nacima da temperatura de background. Anomalias t\u00e9rmicas nas imagens das bandas SWIR foram \n\ntamb\u00e9m identificadas, o que auxiliou numa melhor interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o da atividade eruptiva. \n\n No Cap\u00edtulo 4 investigou-se a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de sensores com diferentes resolu\u00e7\u00f5es temporais \n\ne espaciais para sinergisticamente caracterizar a atividade vulc\u00e2nica t\u00e9rmica. Os sensores MODIS \n\ne ASTER, ambos do sat\u00e9lite Terra, foram utilizados para este fim, fornecendo m\u00faltiplas \n\naquisi\u00e7\u00f5es contempor\u00e2neas. Os dados cobriram uma s\u00e9rie temporal de 11 anos, considerando-se \n\nquatro vulc\u00f5es distintos: Erta \u2018Ale (Eti\u00f3pia), K?lauea (Hava\u00ed), L\u00e1scar (Chile) e Kliuchevskoi \n\n(R\u00fassia). Os dados do MODIS foram utilizados para medir a radia\u00e7\u00e3o vulc\u00e2nica e caracterizar \n\nmudan\u00e7as din\u00e2micas ao longo do tempo, bem como para capturar eventos ef\u00eameros. Os dados do \n\nASTER permitiram a delimita\u00e7\u00e3o do tamanho, forma, localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e orienta\u00e7\u00e3o de anomalias \n\n\n\n121 \n \n\nt\u00e9rmicas, incluindo a detec\u00e7\u00e3o de atividades t\u00e9rmicas relativamente sutis. Isso possibilitou a \n\ncompara\u00e7\u00e3o do tamanho e intensidade de anomalias t\u00e9rmicas em diferentes estilos de vulcanismo, \n\nou seja, em um lago de lava, em erup\u00e7\u00f5es do tipo havaiano e estromboliano, e em situa\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ndesgaseifica\u00e7\u00e3o passiva. A radi\u00e2ncia emitida pelos vulc\u00f5es e medida pelo sensor MODIS foi \n\nsubmetida a an\u00e1lise pelo m\u00e9todo de wavelets, o que permitiu a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos per\u00edodos de \n\ntempo em que a atividade vulc\u00e2nica cresceu e diminuiu em eventos individuais, assim como os \n\nper\u00edodos de quiesc\u00eancia vulc\u00e2nica.  \n\n O cap\u00edtulo 5 introduz uma nova metodologia para calcular fluxo radiante de pixels \n\ntermalmente heterog\u00eanicos que foi baseado na modelagem de espectros de radi\u00e2ncia atrav\u00e9s de \n\numa biblioteca espectral. A precis\u00e3o e confiabilidade desta abordagem foi analisada utilizando \n\numa vasta cole\u00e7\u00e3o de espectros sint\u00e9ticos (i.e. espectros Monte Carlo). Os modelos produzidos \n\ntiveram alta precis\u00e3o (i.e. 3 - 5 %). Tamb\u00e9m foi estudada a possibilidade de obter o tamanho e \n\ntemperatura dos componentes subpixel atrav\u00e9s de modelagem. Os resultados mostram que o \n\ntamanho e temperatura n\u00e3o poderiam ser confiavelmente determinados mesmo com n\u00edvel de \n\nprecis\u00e3o obtido pela modelagem. Este resultado sugere que n\u00e3o \u00e9 poss\u00edvel obter caracter\u00edsticas \n\nsubpixel somente atrav\u00e9s de informa\u00e7\u00e3o espectral. \n\n \n\n6.2.

O United States \n\nGeological Survey (USGS) assumir\u00e1 o controle do LDCM em cerca de 100 dias ap\u00f3s a decolagem, \n\na partir de quando os dados estar\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis sem custo para todos os usu\u00e1rios. O sat\u00e9lite \n\n\n\n122 \n \n\nSentinel 2, com lan\u00e7amento previsto para 2013 pela Ag\u00eancia Espacial Europeia (ESA), deve \n\noferecer imagens de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial (10 a 60 m), com alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal para a sua \n\nclasse (i.e. 5 dias no equador em modo normal; e 2 dias utilizando o modo de emerg\u00eancia). O \n\nCentro Aeroespacial Alem\u00e3o (DLR) deve lan\u00e7ar at\u00e9 2015 o Environmental Mapping and Analysis \n\nProgram (EnMap) - um sensor hiperespectral que fornecer\u00e1 o maior n\u00famero de bandas espectrais \n\npara uso civil futuro e com capacidade de apontamento de \u00b1 30\no\n, permitindo a revisita  de um \n\nalvo em at\u00e9 4 dias. O terceiro Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS - 3) da Ag\u00eancia de \n\nExplora\u00e7\u00e3o Aeroespacial do Jap\u00e3o (JAXA) conter\u00e1 o Hyperspectral Imager Suite (HISUI), um \n\nsensor visto como uma esp\u00e9cie de continua\u00e7\u00e3o do sensor ASTER, com um radi\u00f4metro \n\nmultiespectral no VNIR e um radi\u00f4metro hiperespectral no SWIR. \n\n \n\nTabela 1. Sat\u00e9lites futuros para monitoramento de vulc\u00f5es na faixa espectral do infravermelho. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nA NASA planeja lan\u00e7ar o Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) em algum momento \n\nem torno de 2020. Este sensor est\u00e1 sendo concebido para m\u00faltiplas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em Geoci\u00eancias, \n\nincluindo monitoramento de vulc\u00f5es, e compreende especifica\u00e7\u00f5es extremamente promissoras. \n\nPretende-se incluir um imageador hiperespectral no VSWIR, o qual produzir\u00e1 imagens co-\n\nregistr\u00e1veis a outras produzidas por uma su\u00edte de sensores multiespectrais no MIR e TIR, com o \n\nmesmo tamanho de pixel. A resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal do imageador hiperespectral ser\u00e1 de 19 dias \n\nenquanto do sensor multiespectral ser\u00e1 de 5 dias. Os dados ser\u00e3o coletados continuamente \n\ndurante o dia e noite. \n\n \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\n6.2.2. Miss\u00f5es de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal \n\n \n\nA ESA lan\u00e7ar\u00e1 a plataforma Sentinel 3 em 2013. Esta miss\u00e3o deve incluir o Sea and Land \n\nSurface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), que emular\u00e1 as capacidades do MODIS, fornecendo \n\nimagens-produto em at\u00e9 3 horas ap\u00f3s a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o. Esta lat\u00eancia m\u00ednima entre a radi\u00e2ncia \n\natingindo o sensor e a entrega dos dados \u00e9 extremamente importante para monitoramento de \n\nvulc\u00f5es em tempo real.  \n\nA JAXA est\u00e1 em processo de execu\u00e7\u00e3o do Global Change Observation Mission \n\n(GCOM), que consiste de duas s\u00e9ries de sat\u00e9lites. Um deles, o GCOM - C, ser\u00e1 destinado ao \n\nmonitoramento de mudan\u00e7as clim\u00e1ticas e tamb\u00e9m poder\u00e1 ser \u00fatil ao monitoramento de vulc\u00f5es, \n\nvisto que cada sistema ter\u00e1 um banda no SWIR com pixels de 250 m e um per\u00edodo de visita de 2 a \n\n3 dias. \n\n Dados de sat\u00e9lite geoestacion\u00e1rios tamb\u00e9m dever\u00e3o ser al\u00e7ados a um novo patamar com o \n\nlan\u00e7amento do Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite - s\u00e9rie R (GOES - R), previsto \n\npara 2015, que fornecer\u00e1 cobertura das Am\u00e9ricas. O instrumento principal de observa\u00e7\u00e3o da Terra \n\nser\u00e1 a Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), que oferecer\u00e1 11 canais a mais do que as miss\u00f5es GOES \n\nprecedentes, 7 dos quais posicionados em comprimentos de onda do MIR e TIR. O ABI oferecer\u00e1 \n\numa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal padr\u00e3o de 15 minutos para as Am\u00e9ricas como um todo; 5 minutos sobre \n\no Estados Unidos e at\u00e9 30 segundos sobre regi\u00f5es de interesse. Sua resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial nas bandas \n\ndo infravermelho ser\u00e1 duas vezes mais alta (i.e. 2 km por pixel) do que sensores anteriores da \n\ns\u00e9rie GOES. \n\n \n\n6.2.3. Sensores n\u00e3o-governamentais \n\n \n\nAl\u00e9m das miss\u00f5es de organiza\u00e7\u00f5es governamentais previstas, a explora\u00e7\u00e3o espacial ser\u00e1 cada vez \n\nmais aberta para iniciativas na \u00e1rea acad\u00eamica e comercial. A Universidade do Hava\u00ed, em Manoa, \n\npor exemplo, est\u00e1 construindo um espectr\u00f4metro de baixo custo, com cobertura no infravermelho \n\ntermal, denominado de Thermal Hyperspectral Imager (THI), o qual est\u00e1 sendo projetado para \n\nuso a bordo de um micro-sat\u00e9lite. Esse objetivo ser\u00e1 alcan\u00e7ado utilizando-se pe\u00e7as e produtos \n\ncomerciais (COTS) prontos e semi-prontos, os quais ser\u00e3o montados numa c\u00e2mara de v\u00e1cuo. \n\nEsse tipo de abordagem pode permitir que outras institui\u00e7\u00f5es acad\u00eamicas construam seus \n\n\n\n124 \n \n\npr\u00f3prios sensores orbitais. Empresas privadas t\u00eam fornecido imagens de sat\u00e9lite por d\u00e9cadas, \n\nentretanto, o seu custo \u00e9 normalmente proibitivo para fins de monitoramento de vulc\u00f5es. \n\nAtualmente h\u00e1 esfor\u00e7os no sentido de convencer algumas empresas a adquirir e compartilhar \n\ndados de pelo menos alguns vulc\u00f5es ativos de uma forma consistente. Este \u00e9 uma possibilidade \n\nanimadora por causa das capacidades dos sat\u00e9lites comerciais sendo desenvolvidos. Por exemplo, \n\no WorldView-3 da DigitalGlobe fornecer\u00e1 imagens multiespectrais com oito bandas no SWIR e \n\numa resolu\u00e7\u00e3o temporal de 1 a 5 dias, al\u00e9m de uma alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial de 3,7 m. \n\n \n\n6.2.4. Ve\u00edculos A\u00e9reos N\u00e3o Tripulados (VANTs) \n\n \n\nDados a\u00e9reos est\u00e3o prestes a se tornar cada vez mais acess\u00edveis, dado o aumento de acessibilidade \n\nde ve\u00edculos a\u00e9reos n\u00e3o tripulados (VANTs). Avan\u00e7os na tecnologia VANT podem proporcionar \n\ndados adquiridos de forma cont\u00ednua e de baixo custo, ou seja, semelhante aos sat\u00e9lites, mas com \n\nresolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial superior e efeitos atmosf\u00e9ricos minimizados. Em geral, a opera\u00e7\u00e3o humana de \n\nnovas technologias \u00e9 de alto custo. Para minimizar esta depend\u00eancia, os VANTs exigiriam \n\ndecolagem e aterrissagem autom\u00e1ticas (a partir de helic\u00f3pteros comuns e helic\u00f3pteros \n\nquadrotores) e/ou a capacidade de permanecer no ar por per\u00edodos prolongados de tempo (i.e. \n\nsemanas) (a partir de plataformas flutuantes na atmosfera). Idealmente, os VANTs seriam \n\nestacionados permanentemente em um vulc\u00e3o para obter dados ao longo tempo, mas a sua alta \n\nmobilidade tamb\u00e9m os tornaria excelentes para responder a emerg\u00eancias. \n\n \n\n6.2.5. Demanda do usu\u00e1rio \n\n \n\nDados de sensoriamento remoto est\u00e3o se tornando uma parte cada vez maior da vida cotidiana. \n\nSites bem estabelecidos j\u00e1 fornecem produtos de monitoramento de vulc\u00f5es num formato simples \n\ne sem custos (por exemplo, aqueles hospedado pela Universidade de Alaska Fairbanks \n\n(avo.images.alaska.edu) e da Universidade do Hava\u00ed (modis.higp.hawaii.edu)). A familiaridade \n\ncom estes produtos somente tende a aumentar e, por consequ\u00eancia, tamb\u00e9m a demanda. Al\u00e9m \n\ndisso, dada a inten\u00e7\u00e3o crescente de organiza\u00e7\u00f5es governamentais em fornecer dados de sat\u00e9lite \n\nsem custo ao usu\u00e1rio final, novas abordagens para monitoramento de vulc\u00f5es provavelmente \n\nsurgir\u00e3o. Por exemplo, aplicativos para dispositivos m\u00f3veis (ex. smart phones e tablets) \n\n\n\n125 \n \n\npoderiam fornecer produtos (ex. imagens, filmes, s\u00e9ries de tempo, etc) direta e automaticamente \n\naos interessados. O aumento da interconectividade tamb\u00e9m deve estimular ainda mais a demanda \n\npara a pesquisa em sistemas de monitoramento autom\u00e1tico de vulc\u00f5es, e para produtos cada vez \n\nmais intuitivos e informativos. \n\n \n\n6.3. Conclus\u00f5es \n\n \n\nAs conclus\u00f5es desta tese s\u00e3o apresentadas a seguir. \n\n \n\ni) Para caracterizar a gama completa dos fen\u00f4menos exibidos pelos vulc\u00f5es \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio observa-\n\nlos em v\u00e1rias escalas espacias e temporiais e todos os comprimentos de onda do infravermelho. \n\nEsta necessidade surge do fato que produtos de erup\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00eam uma varia\u00e7\u00e3o enorme em tamanho, \n\naproxidamente entre 1 e 1.000.000 metros, e podem se manifestar em periodos de tempo que \n\nvariam de minutos a meses. Ademais, a radi\u00e2ncia emitida por tais produtos \u00e9 fortemente \n\ndependente da temperatura dos mesmos. Para garantir que a atividade vulc\u00e2nica seja imageada \n\ndentro dos limites de dete\u00e7\u00e3o e satura\u00e7\u00e3o de pelo menos um dos canais espectrais, \u00e9 essencial \n\nobservar tal atividade em v\u00e1rios comprimentos de onda no infravermelho. \u00c9 por isso que o \n\ndesenvolvimento de sinergias entre diversos sensores \u00e9 crucial. \n\n \n\nii) A heterogeneidade termal na escala de um pixel provavelmente exclui a possibilidade de \n\ncalcular a temperatura de alvos vulc\u00e2nicos com confian\u00e7a pelos seguintes motivos: 1) medidas de \n\nradi\u00e2ncia n\u00e3o podem ser obtidas com o grau suficiente de precis\u00e3o e 2) os modelos que formam a \n\nbase do c\u00e1lculo da temperatura tendem a ser  simples demais e, portanto, n\u00e3o representam  a \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o verdadeira da temperatura superficial. Medidas alternativas como radi\u00e2ncia, fluxo \n\nradiante e excit\u00e2ncia, que podem ser obtidas confiavelmente mesmo em superf\u00edcies termalmente \n\nheterog\u00eaneas, s\u00e3o portanto mais adequadas para o monitoramento de vulc\u00f5es e outras atividades \n\nan\u00e1logas (ex., monitoramento de inc\u00eandios e \u00e1reas geotermais). \n\n \n\niii) Al\u00e9m de quantificar atividade termal em pixels individuais \u00e9 \u00fatil tratar tal atividade como \n\nconjuntos de pixels com carater\u00edsticas espaciais coletivas. Por exemplo, quantificar o tamanho de \n\n\u00e1reas termalmente ativas facilita compara\u00e7\u00f5es com atividade observada em campo. Novos \n\n\n\n126 \n \n\navan\u00e7os neste assunto poderiam incluir a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o da forma, localiza\u00e7\u00e3o e orienta\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00e1reas que s\u00e3o termalmente ativas e a an\u00e1lise das mudan\u00e7as nestas caracter\u00edsticas espaciais no \n\ntempo. Informa\u00e7\u00f5es sobre o comportamento de atividade termal no espa\u00e7o e no tempo podem \n\najudar a diagnosticar os processos vulc\u00e2nicos por tr\u00e1s destas atividades e a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\nriscos que elas trazem. \n\n \n\niv) Um dos objetivos principais do estudo de vulc\u00f5es \u00e9 a previs\u00e3o de erup\u00e7\u00f5es. Esta tese \n\nidentificou novos precursores \u00e0 atividade vulc\u00e2nica utilizando imagens do infravermelho.\u00c9 \n\nprov\u00e1vel que outros precursores existam. A sua descoberta seria facilitada com o acesso de tais \n\nimagens em um formato amig\u00e1vel para quem n\u00e3o seja neccess\u00e1rio um especialista em \n\nsensoriamento remoto. O fornecimento de dados processados pode ser feito de forma \n\nautomatizada com as metodologias desenvolvidas neste trabalho de doutorado. A distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ngratuita de dados processados para qualquer pessoa interessada poderia ajudar em avan\u00e7os, por \n\nexemplo, na an\u00e1lise de s\u00e9ries de tempo (ex. atrav\u00e9s wavelets) o que, por sua vez, permitiria \n\ncontribuir na previs\u00e3o de erup\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\n  \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nBulletin of the Global Volcanism Network.
