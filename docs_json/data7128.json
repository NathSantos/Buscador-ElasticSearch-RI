Se h\u00e1 \ndezenas de anos o pl\u00e1stico veio, por exemplo, substituir o marfim nas bolas de \nbilhar, salvando vidas de milhares de elefantes, hoje, procuramos um \nsubstituto para esse pl\u00e1stico, de forma a preservar as condi\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais \nque nos permitem viver harmoniosamente com a restante fauna e flora, e que \na esp\u00e9cie humana tem, nos \u00faltimos anos, vindo a destruir. O pl\u00e1stico \u00e9 um \nderivado do petr\u00f3leo, cujo pre\u00e7o tem vindo a crescer exponencialmente, devido \nao facto de ser barato e possuir propriedades que permitem desenhar produtos \nessenciais \u00e0 vida quotidiana. Por isso, precisamos de sair da era petroqu\u00edmica \ne entrar numa nova era ambientalmente sustent\u00e1vel, baseada em materiais \nbiodegrad\u00e1veis provenientes de fontes renov\u00e1veis. Esta mudan\u00e7a para rotas \n\u201cverdes\u201d, s\u00f3 ser\u00e1 poss\u00edvel com o apoio de grandes empresas, e medidas \ngovernamentais dr\u00e1sticas. O poli\u00e1cido l\u00e1ctico, PLA,  produzido a partir da \nlactose presente no amido ou no a\u00e7\u00facar, tem sido intensivamente estudado \nnos \u00faltimos anos e possui potencial para substituir os tradicionais pol\u00edmeros \nderivados do petr\u00f3leo, se forem melhoradas algumas propriedades \nnecess\u00e1rias ao processamento por extrus\u00e3o. O PLA, \u00e9 muito fr\u00e1gil, pouco \nresistente e pouco flex\u00edvel. Neste trabalho foram adicionados antioxidantes \nnaturais (alfa-tocoferol) e sint\u00e9ticos (BHT e TBHQ) ao PLA com o objetivo n\u00e3o \ns\u00f3 de melhorar as suas propriedades mec\u00e2nicas, mas tamb\u00e9m de criar uma \nembalagem ativa que prolongue o prazo de validade dos alimentos e melhore \nas suas propriedades organol\u00e9ticas prevenindo altera\u00e7\u00f5es ou perda de sabor. \nO impacto da adi\u00e7\u00e3o destes  antioxidantes nas propriedades originais do PLA \na n\u00edvel mec\u00e2nico, t\u00e9rmico e de barreira foi estudado pela utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das \nt\u00e9cnicas de FTIR, DSC, SEM, AFM, DMA, TGA, QCM e time-lag.  \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nPoly(lactic acid), PLA, active packaging, ?-tocopherol, BHT, TBHQ, quartz \ncrystal microbalance, time-lag, sorption, permeability, solubility and diffusivity. \n \n\nabstract \n\n \nIn recent years, the search for a environmentally friendly products has \nincreased. One of the major challenges has been the demand for \nbiodegradable materials that can replace plastic. If a few decades ago, plastic \nreplaced, for example, the ivory in billiard balls, and in other products, saving \nthe lives of thousands elephants, nowadays a replacement for that plastic is \nbeing searched, to prevent the change of the environmental conditions, \nessential to life in harmonly with the fauna and flora that the human specie has, \nin recent years, destroyed. Plastic is a petroleum derivate, whose price has \nbeen growing exponentially, mainly due to the fact of beind a cheap material \nand also to enable the production of products that are essential to modern life. \nTherefore, the petrochemical era is going to come to an end and a new \nenvironmentally sustainable era, based on biodegradable materials from \nrenewable sources, will follow. The change to green routes only will be possible \nwith the support of the major companies, and the implementation of drastic \ngovernmental law.  \nPoly(lactic acid), PLA, is produced from the lactose present in the corn or \nsugarcane and has been intensively studied in recent years because if some \nlimitants properties required its extrusion are overcome, it has the potential to \nreplace the traditional polymers. PLA have high brittleness, low toughness and \nlow tensile elongation. In this work, natural antioxidant (alpha-tocopherol) and \nsynthetics antioxidants (BHT ant TBHQ) were added to the PLA with the aim \nnot only to improve their flexibility, but also to create an active packaging to \nextend the shelf life of the foods and improve the organoleptic properties by \npreventing food losses. The impact of the addition of antioxidants into the PLA \nfilms, in its mechanical, thermal and barrier properties were studied by FTIR, \nDSC, SEM, AFM, DMA, TGA, QCM and time-lag techniques. \n \n\n \n\n\n\ni \n\n \n\nContents \n\n \n\nContents .................................................................................................................................. i \n\nList of Figures ....................................................................................................................... iii \n\nList of Tables ........................................................................................................................ ix \n\nNomenclature........................................................................................................................ xi \n\n1.

Introduction \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1. Context \n \n\nSince their pioneering days over a hundred years ago, plastics have greatly \n\nimproved human living conditions and are indispensable and irreplaceable in modern \n\neveryday life. As a result of their resource, efficient production processes, facile \n\nprocessing, and high versatility in terms of tunable properties and broad range of \n\napplications, these materials render high technologies affordable for all humankind.\n1\n \n\nPlastics are versatile materials potentially indestructible, ideal for a number of commercial \n\nand domestic applications. Every day thousands of tones of plastic are used and disposed \n\nin the form of disposable cups to thin cellular packing. Statistics show that about 85 % of \n\nthese plastics are sent to landfill or dumped elsewhere.\n2\n Every year in Europe, 10 million \n\ntones of post-consumer plastic waste are buried in landfills\n3\n,\n \nthat  are quickly reaching their \n\ncapacities, and consequently new landfills are opened, generating great environmental threat in \n\nthe coming years. Although plastics take long time to break down, only about 5 % of \n\nplastics used are currently being recycled.\n2\n Plastics make our life easier and better, e.g. \n\nwhen used as packaging they can safely protect from damage and leaking and deliver a \n\nproduct unalterable from the manufacturer to the consumer, in a world where one more day \n\nof shelf life matters and simultaneously safety cannot be compromised. The world\u2019s plastic \n\nconsumption has increased incredibly in recent decades, generating more and more plastic \n\nwaste, thus increasing the public concern.\n4\n Petrochemical-based plastics such as \n\nPolyethylene (PE) polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS) and \n\npolyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyamide (PA) have been increasingly used as \n\npackaging materials due not only to their large availability at relatively low cost, but also \n\nto their good mechanical performance such as tensile and tear strength, good barrier to \n\noxygen, carbon dioxide and aroma compound, heat sealability, and so on. \n5\n \n\nWorldwide plastics production increased 4 % in 2011, with more than 10 million \n\ntons of plastics produced. Polyolefins, PP, PVC, PET and PS account for about 70 % of the \n\ntotal global demand, i.e. 200 million tons. From 2010 to 2016, global plastics consumption \n\nis expected to grow by an average of about 4 % each year. The world will consume 540 \n\nmillion tons of plastic in 2020.\n6\n Figure 1 present the estimates of worldwide production by \n\n2016. \n4\n \n\n \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Estimates of the worldwide production of plastics. \n4\n \n\n \n\nDuring the 20\nth\n\n century, a great variety of synthetic polymers became available at \n\nindustrial scale. This was mainly due to the petrochemistry, a strong technology emerging \n\nsince the 1950s. Exploitation of oil and gas as fossil raw materials for the chemical \n\nindustry and polymer production greatly improved cost-effectiveness and simplified \n\nmanufacturing of macromolecular materials. Since then, the attractive combination of low \n\ncost with facile processing and innovation represents the key feature of plastics. In the \n\n1990s, new recycling technologies enabled the effective reuse of polymer products that had \n\ncompleted their first lifecycle.\n1\n  \n\nPolymer wastes can thus become a valuable source of raw materials and energy. In today\u2019s \n\nhighly efficient industrial polymerization processes, polymers are tailored to be stiff, soft \n\nor rubbery, conducting or insulating, optically transparent or opaque, permeable or \n\nimpermeable, stable or (bio)degradable. Prominent examples of polymer applications \n\ninclude food and medical packaging materials, lightweight engineering plastics in the \n\nautomotive and aerospace industries, damage-tolerant construction materials for modern \n\narchitecture, high-strength fibers for textiles and composite materials, printed circuit \n\nboards and photoresists for microelectronics, solvent-free coatings for corrosion protection, \n\nadhesives, and new materials for biomedical applications such as wound dressing, \n\nmembranes for artificial kidneys and water purification, dental fillings, drug delivery \n\nsystems, artificial hearts, and implants. Plastics have become essential components of \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\nvirtually any kind of consumer product, meeting the highly diversified demands of human \n\nsociety.\n1\n Despite the many applications that a wide diversity of plastics find in different \n\nsectors, the packaging industry is by far the one that shows the highest use of these \n\nmaterials, as depicted in Figure 2.\n6\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 European Plastics demand and its sectors of application.\n6\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFood packaging is a necessary part of exchanging goods around a country and the \n\nworld, securing the food supply chain. The way consumers buy goods demands protection \n\nand preservation.\n5\n In industrialized countries, polymer packaging secures the food supply \n\nchain, whereas in developing countries around half the food is lost in transportation.\n1\n \n\nFor a long time polymers have supplied most of common packaging materials \n\nbecause they are able to present several key features like softness, lightness and \n\ntransparency. However, increased use of synthetic packaging has led to serious ecological \n\nproblems due to their total non-biodegradability.\n5\n Figure 3 illustrates the different types of \n\nplastics used in the different packaging applications. \n\n \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Types of plastic packaging divided by type of use and type of resin.\n7\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nIt is widely accepted that the use of long-lasting polymers from petrochemicals in \n\nproducts with a short life-span, such as engineering applications packaging, catering, \n\nsurgery, and hygiene, is not adequate. Persistent polymers generate significant sources of \n\nenvironmental pollution, harming wildlife when they are dispersed in nature.\n8\n Moreover, \n\nincineration of plastic waste presents severe environmental issues since it yields toxic \n\nemissions (e.g., dioxins).\n8\n Although their complete replacement with eco-friendly \n\npackaging films is just impossible to achieve, at least for specific applications, like food \n\npackaging, the use of bioplastics is clearly the future.\n5\n \n\nToday the world is quickly coming to realize the impact of packaging on human life. \n\nThe world is beginning to see the effects of our existence on the planet. This has sparked a \n\nmajor movement towards maintaining society\u2019s thirst for goods while improving the \n\nfootprint left on our planet.\n5\n The past few years, marked by the paradigm of sustainable \n\ndevelopment, have brought about a renewed interest in biodegradable polymers originating \n\nfrom renewable resources. The most important market for those novel polymers will be the \n\npackaging sector, within which food packaging represents approximately 65 % in volume.\n9\n   \n\nBio-based polymers offer important contributions by reducing the dependence on fossil \n\nfuels and through the related positive environmental impacts such as reduced carbon \n\ndioxide emissions.\n10\n\n The first generation of bio-based polymers focused on deriving \n\npolymers from agricultural feedstocks such as corn, potatoes, and other carbohydrate \n\nfeedstocks. However, the focus has shifted in recent years due to a desire to move away \n\nfrom food-based resources and also significant breakthroughs in biotechnology.\n10\n\n Bio-\n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nbased polymers similar to conventional polymers are produced by bacterial fermentation \n\nprocesses synthesis of the building blocks (monomers) from renewable resources, \n\nincluding lignocellulosic biomass (starch and cellulose), fatty acids, and organic waste.\n10\n\n \n\nNatural bio-based polymers are the other class of bio-based polymers which are found in \n\nnature, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and polysaccharides (collagen, chitosan, etc.). These \n\nbio-based polymers have shown enormous growth in recent years in terms of technological \n\ndevelopments and their commercial applications.\n10\n\n  \n\nThe terms bio-based polymers and biodegradable polymers are used extensively in the \n\nliterature.\n10\n\n Biodegradable polymers are defined as materials whose physical and chemical \n\nproperties undergo deterioration and completely degrade when exposed to microorganisms, \n\ncarbon dioxide (aerobic) processes, methane (anaerobic processes), and water (aerobic and \n\nanaerobic processes).\n10\n\n Bio-based polymers can be biodegradable (e.g., polylactic acid) or \n\nnondegradable (e.g., biopolyethylene). Similarly, while many bio-based polymers are \n\nbiodegradable (e.g., starch and polyhydroxyalkanoates), not all biodegradable polymers are \n\nbio-based (e.g., polycaprolactone).\n10\n\n There are three principal ways to produce bio-based \n\npolymers as shown in Figure 4: \n\nProduction of\n\nBiobased Polymers\n\nPolymers from Agro \n\nresources \n\n(by extraction and \n\nseparation)\n\nFrom  \n\nmicroorganisms \n\n(by fermentation) \n\nFrom \n\nbiotechnology (via \n\nconventional \n\nsynthesis)  \n\nPolysaccharides and\n\nLipids ( Starch, \n\nCellulose, Alginates)\n\nPolyhydroxyalka\n\nnoates (mcl-\n\nPHA, PHB, \n\nPHB-co-V)\n\nPoly lactides, \n\nPBS, PE, PTT, \n\nPPP\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Bio-based polymers produced by different processes.\n11\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\nBio-based polymers hold a tiny fraction of the total global plastic market. Recent \n\ndata show that the production of bio-based polymers should increase from 1.5 % in 2011 to \n\n3 % in 2020. Figure 5 shows the evolution of production capacities of bio-based \n\npolymers.\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Evolution of production capacities of bio-based polymers.\n12\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe worldwide interest in bio-based polymers has accelerated in recent years due to the \n\ndesire and need to find non-fossil fuel-based polymers as shown in Figure 6.\n10\n\n Several \n\nsynthetic polymers are biodegradable and compostable like natural carbon-based polymers, \n\nsuch as starch, cellulose and lignin. In the same way some bioplastics based on natural \n\nmonomers, can lose biodegradability through chemical modifications, like polymerization, \n\nsuch as for example Nylon 9 types polymers obtained from polymerization of oleic acid \n\nmonomer or Polyamid 11 obtained from the polymerization  of castor oil monomer.\n5\n \n\nSynthetic and natural polymers stand at the opposite ends of a spectrum of \n\nproperties: i) polyolefins are hydrocarbon hydrophobic polymers, resistant to peroxidation \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nand biodegradation, highly resistant to hydrolysis, which is their main attribute for the \n\napplication in packaging. To make polyolefins biodegradable it is necessary to introduce \n\npro-oxidant additives which promote the oxo-biodegradation by producing low molar mass \n\noxidation compounds bioassimilable by the microorganisms; ii) natural compounds, like \n\ncellulose, starch and so on, are hydrophilic polymers, water wettable or swellable and \n\nconsequently biodegradable. They are not technologically useful for food packaging where \n\nwater resistance is required. Between these two extremes are the hydro-biodegradable \n\naliphatic polyesters such as polylactic acid (PLA) and the poly(hydroxyacid) (PHA).\n5\n \n\nAmong bio-source-based polymers emerging on the food market, the semi-crystalline \n\npolyester poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is one of the most applied.\n9\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Citation trends of (a) publications and (b) patents on bio-based polymers in recent years.\n10\n\n \n\n\n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. Poly(lactic acid) \n\n \nLactic acid (2-hydroxy propionic acid) is a molecular compound with a chiral carbon \n\natom and exists in two enantiomeric forms (Figure 7). The lactide monomer, from which \n\nPLA is made of, comes from lactic acid, that has two enantiomers, L and D\n13\n\n (Figure 7).\n14\n\n \n\nControl of the (L:D) monomer ratio is a very important feature in PLA, since it has a large \n\neffect on material properties, including the degradation time,\n13\n\n melting temperature, degree \n\nof crystallinity, and barrier properties. Generally, higher L-lactide content should result in \n\nhigher barrier properties of the polymer because of greater stereochemical purity.\n15\n\n The L-\n\ntype is the most abundant naturally.\n15\n\n The chiral nature of lactic acid results in distinct \n\nforms of polylactide, namely, poly(L-lactide) (PLLA), poly(D-lactide) (PDLA), and \n\npoly(DL-lactide) (PDLLA), which are synthesized from the L-, D- and DL-lactic acid \n\nmonomers, respectively, or from the corresponding L,L-lactide, D,D-lactide, and DL-\n\nlactide, respectively.\n15\n\n \n\nThe future widespread availability of PLA raises interesting and important questions \n\nregarding its application.\n13\n\n \n\n(R)-Lactic acid\n\nD-(-) Lactic acid\n\n(S)-Lactic acid\n\nL-(+) Lactic acid\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Chemical structure of L - and D - lactic acid and the enantiomeric forms of lactic acid: (S) - and \n\n(R) \u2013 2- hydroxypropionic acid.\n15\n\n \n\n \n\nThe lactic acid molecule has a hydroxyl and an acid functional group, which may \n\nresult in intermolecular and intramolecular esterification reactions.\n14\n\n Almost all lactic acid \n\navailable in the market is produced by fermentation. During fermentation, a suitable \n\ncarbohydrate is converted to lactic acid by microorganisms. \n14\n\n  \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nThe first step of the polymerization is the formation of a linear dimer (lactoyl lactic \n\nacid). This condensation reaction can proceed to higher oligomers and is promoted by \n\nelimination of water. Also a cyclic dimer, lactide, is formed in small amounts. Lactide can \n\nbe formed by intramolecular esterification of lactoyl lactic acid or by breakdown of higher \n\noligomers. All reactions are equilibrium reactions (Figure 8).\n15\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Lactic acid condensation reactions-interchange between lactide, oligomers, and poly(lactic \n\nacide).\n15\n\n \n\n \n\nLactic acid can form PLA by means of the reaction of the hydroxyl and carboxylic \n\nacid groups of lactic acid. By removing the water formed during this condensation \n\nreaction, the reaction proceeds towards the product side, PLA. The preparation of PLA \n\nfrom lactic acid by direct condensation can be divided into three principal stages: i) \n\nremoval of the free water content, ii) oligomer polycondensation, and iii) melt \n\npolycondensation of high molecular weight PLA.\n15\n\n  \n\nHigh molecular mass PLA is obtained either by the polycondensation of lactic acid \n\nor by ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of the cyclic dimer 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dioxane-\n\n\n\n11 \n\n \n\n2,5-dione commonly referred to as dilactic or lactide. The generally applied ROP process \n\nfor polylactides involves three separate steps: polycondensation, lactide manufacturing, \n\nand ring-opening polymerization.\n15\n\n  \n\nCommercial PLA is usually prepared from L-lactic (LLA), because the resulting \n\npolymer poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is semicrystalline with a relatively high melting and \n\nglass transition temperature (Tg). \n\nPolylactides have been known for several decades but only recently have these \n\npolymers gained commercial significance as a leading environmentally benign plastic \n\navailable from renewable resources. The production of lactic acid started in the United \n\nStates in the 1880s, and, unfortunately the process of fermentation of vegetable sugars was \n\nnot very sucessful.\n15\n\n In 1950, the first commercial production of synthetic lactic acid \n\nstarted in Japan.\n15\n\n In 1966 occurred the first application of polylactides as implants, sutures \n\nand orthopedic fixation, with advantage over nondegradable biomaterials  eliminating the \n\nneed to remove implants and providing long-term biocompatibility, furthermore, it was \n\nobserved that the degradation of PLLA powder implanted had a nontoxic tissue response.\n15\n\n \n\nOnly in 1990, the use of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) in  packaging and other commercial \n\nends started (Table 1).\n15\n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Historical trend in market development of PLA.\n15\n\n \n\n Early 1990s Latter 1990s 2000s \n\nConcept Biodegradability \nPlant origin \n\nBiodegradability \nPlant origin \n\nTarget application \nFishline, net, Compostable \n\nmaterial, Agricultural film \n\nPackaging container \n\nAgricultural and engineering  \n\nCompostable material \n\nPackaging container \n\nDurables \n\nFibers \n\nSocial topics keyword \nLandfill life, Dumping of plastic \n\narticles \n  \n\n \n\nPoly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable thermoplastic polyester that has been the \n\nsubject of intensive research due to its intrinsic characteristics, such as biodegradability \n\nand sustainability, since it is made from natural resources like corn, sugar beet and wheat. \n\nPLA exhibits many properties that are equivalent or superior to those of many petroleum-\n\nbased plastics, which makes it suitable for a large variety of applications. \n16\n\n  \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nFigure 9 presents a comparison of the physical properties of PLA to other \n\ncommodity thermoplastics. It is seen that PLA compares favourably with polystyrene, \n\n(PS), a widely used plastic based on non-renewable resources. It should be noted though, \n\nthat PLA has a glass transition temperature that is significantly lower, Tg ? 59 \u00baC, than \n\npolystyrene, Tg ? 100 \u00baC. This translates into a lower heat distortion temperature and limits \n\nthe applicability of PLA for applications requiring better heat resistance. \n17\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Physical properties of PLA compared to other common plastics.\n17\n\n \n\n  \n\n Packages made with plastic, in contrast to glass or metal packaging material, are \n\npermeable, at different degrees, to small molecules like gases, water vapour, and organic \n\nvapour and to other low molecular weight compounds like aromas, flavour, and additives \n\npresent into food.\n18\n\n The knowledge of the solution/diffusion/permeation behaviours of \n\nthese molecules through the polymer film has become increasingly important in recent \n\nyears, especially for polymers used in the food packaging field where contamination from \n\nexternal environment has to be avoided and the shelf life of the food controlled by the use \n\nof modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) techniques.\n18\n\n \n\nPLA is currently used for single or multilayer films, trays, cups, and bottles, and \n\ncan be manufactured by extrusion, thermoforming, injection and blow molding processes \n\nfor packaging applications. PLA is also suitable for the production and use of functional \n\nmembranes.\n19\n\n It has been reported that PLA is more suitable than polyethylene or \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\npolystyrene as packaging material for juices, yoghurt, salad dressing and sour cream. \n\nNevertheless, when tested with cheese, a moisture loss of 10 times higher than of the \n\nreference packaging (PET) material was observed.\n20\n\n  \n\nDespite PLA shows good physical properties, similar to those of PS and poly(ethylene \n\nterephthalate, PET, the  relatively high oxygen permeability of PLA and its brittleness are \n\nmain drawbacks for flexible packaging applications, namely foods and/or pharmaceuticals \n\nproducts susceptible to oxidation.\n19\n\n The fact that PLA has higher carbon dioxide and \n\noxygen permeability than polystyrene, low density polyethylene, LDPE, and poly(ethylene \n\nterephthalate), clearly indicates that the development of PLA packaging requires further \n\nefforts.  \n\n \n\n1.3. Active packaging \n \n\n Important functionalities of packaging are not only to ensure food safety, but also to \n\nguarantee the organoleptic quality of the packed product during its shelf- life. Shelf-life is \n\ndefined as the time during which the food product will: i) remain safe; ii) be certain to \n\nretain desired sensory, chemical, physical and microbiological characteristics; iii) comply \n\nwith any label declaration of nutritional data, when stored under the recommended \n\nconditions.\n21\n\n Many factors can influence shelf-life, and can be categorized into intrinsic \n\nand extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors are influenced by variables such as raw material type \n\nand quality, and product formulation and structure. \n\nThey include the following: \n\n\u2022 Water activity (aw) (available water). \n\n\u2022 pH value and total acidity; type of acid. \n\n\u2022 Redox potential (Eh). \n\n\u2022 Available oxygen. \n\n\u2022 Nutrients. \n\n\u2022 Natural microflora and surviving microbiological counts. \n\n\u2022 Natural biochemistry of the product formulation (enzymes, chemical reactants). \n\n\u2022 Use of preservatives in product formulation (e.g. salt). \n\nExtrinsic factors are those the final product encounters as it moves through the food \n\nchain. They include the following: \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n\u2022 Time\u2013temperature profile during processing; pressure in the headspace. \n\n\u2022 Temperature control during storage and distribution. \n\n\u2022 Relative humidity (RH) during processing, storage and distribution. \n\n\u2022 Exposure to light (UV and IR) during processing, storage and distribution. \n\n\u2022 Environmental microbial counts during processing, storage and distribution. \n\n\u2022 Composition of atmosphere within packaging. \n\n\u2022 Subsequent heat treatment (e.g. reheating or cooking before consumption). \n\n\u2022 Consumer handling. \n\nAll these factors can operate in an interactive and often unpredictable way, and the \n\npossibility of cross-interactions must be investigated. A particularly useful type of \n\ninteraction occurs when factors such as reduced temperature, mild heat treatment, \n\nantioxidant action and controlled atmosphere packaging operate in synergy to restrict \n\nmicrobial growth, the so-called \u2018hurdle effect\u2019. This way of combining factors which, \n\nindividually, are unable to prevent microbial growth but, in combination, provide a series \n\nof hurdles, allows manufacturers to use milder processing techniques which retain more of \n\na product\u2019s sensory and nutritional properties.\n21\n\n  \n\nThe interaction of such intrinsic and extrinsic factors inhibits or stimulates a number \n\nof processes which limit the product shelf-life. These processes can be classified as \n\nmicrobiological, chemical, physical and temperature related. \n21\n\n \n\nTable 2 shows some examples of processes associated to the deterioration of several \n\nfood classes. In composite foods the factors limiting shelf-life can be quite different from \n\nthose that limit the shelf-life of the individual components. For example, an important \n\nfactor limiting shelf-life in breakfast cereals containing a mixture of cereal and dried fruit \n\nis the hardening of the fruit from moisture migration into the cereal. In contrast, the \n\nlimiting factors for the individual fruit and cereal components would be flavor changes \n\narising from chemical reactions, and moisture uptake and softening of the cereal. There are \n\nmany factors to be considered in choosing the optimal packaging form and material for any \n\nparticular product, including the product characteristics, processing considerations, shelf-\n\nlife required and overall cost. In many cases, packaging is an integral part of the processing \n\nstage. Advances in packaging materials and techniques have increased the options \n\navailable for maintaining quality and for improving the shelf-life of foods.\n21\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Examples of factors limiting shelf-life of some food products.\n21\n\n \n\nProduct Deterioration processes Limiting changes \n\nFruit and vegetables (Soft  fruit, Hard fruit, \n\nColeslaw, prepared salads) \n\nMoisture loss; Enzymic action; \n\nMould growth; fat oxidation \n\nTextural softening; dry appearance; \n\nLoss of crispness; microbial growth; \n\nrancidity \n\nMeat products (fresh red meat, fresh \n\npoultry, fresh bacon, canned ham) \n\nOxidation; microbial growth; \n\nchemical reactions \n\nLoss of red color; rancidity; off-odors \n\nand flavors; freezer burn; microbial; \n\ngas generation \n\nCereal and other dry products (bread, \n\ncakes, dried pasta, breakfast cereals) \n\nStarch retrogradation; moisture \n\nmigration; moisture uptake; \n\noxidation; starch changes; \n\nprotein change \n\nStable texture and flavor; dry texture; \n\nmould growth; drying and hardening; \n\nmould formation; rancidity \n\nBeverages (carbonated beverages, beer; \n\ncoffee; fruit juices, tea, wine) \n\nGas evolution, \n\nhydrolysis/oxidation; microbial \n\ngrowth; volatile loss; enzymic \n\nreactions \n\n \n\nCarbonation loss: flavor loss; \n\nrancidity; turbidity; nutrient loss; \n\nflavor loss \n\nDairy products (ice-cream, butter, cheese, \n\nyoghurt) \n\nMoisture migration; oxidation; \n\nhydrolysis reactions; microbial \n\ngrowth; lactose crystallization; \n\nsyneresis \n\nIce crystal formation; rancidity; gritty \n\ntexture; mould production; serum \n\nseparation;  \n\n \n\nModified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP), which involves replacing the air in the headspace \n\nof a packaged product with a single or mixture of special gases, has made the greatest \n\nimpact on the shelf-life of chilled products. The gases commonly used are carbon dioxide \n\nand nitrogen. Carbon dioxide is used to suppress microbial growth, but its effectiveness is \n\nvery much dependent on the sensitivity of different classes of microorganisms to this gas. \n\nNitrogen is used as a inert filler, since oxygen is to be excluded to prevent aerobic \n\nspoilage. One special case, however, is that of fresh fruit and vegetables, where a delicate \n\nbalance of carbon dioxide and oxygen is necessary to allow aerobic respiration to continue \n\nat a very low rate and thereby extend shelf-life. One of the requirements of food packaging \n\nis that it should play a passive role, remaining inert and not interacting with the food it \n\ncontains. \n21\n\n  However, as a result of new consumer trends, a demand for better fresh-like \n\nquality using convenient food products intensifiers made traditional packaging concepts \n\noutdated. Besides the protection of the foods shape and texture, preservation of flavors and \n\nodours, shelf-life extension and control of the water or moisture content of foods, the \n\npackaging industry has been developing a new innovative concept: active packaging. \n22\u201324 \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nThis is a type of packaging where changes in the packaging atmosphere are promoted in \n\norder to fulfil one or more specific objectives, such as the extension of its shelf-life and the \n\nincrease of the packaged foods safety and quality. \n22\n\n \n\n Active packaging systems can be regarded as active scavenging/releasing systems. \n\nWhile in the first type undesired compounds such as oxygen, ethylene, carbon dioxide or \n\nmoisture are removed, in the last compounds such as carbon dioxide, water, antioxidants or \n\npreservatives are added. The most studied of these compounds are undoubtly oxygen and \n\ncarbon dioxide. Although CO2 has a beneficial effect in microbiological control and in the \n\nstorage of foods such as meat, cheese or fish, an excess of CO2 may cause package \n\ncollapse, promoting anaerobic metabolism, pH reduction and flavor change. Micro-\n\nperforation is the most used method to control CO2 content inside the package, due the \n\ndeterioration or respiration reactions, by increasing the permeability of the gas through the \n\npackaging material. \n25,26\n\n \n\n On the other hand, oxygen is responsible for several undesirable chemical reactions \n\nin foods, promoting the growth of aerobic microbes and the spoilage of many foods by \n\nmicrobial attack. Nonetheless, oxygen inhibits the growth of anaerobic micro-\n\norganisms.\n25,26\n\n  The mould growth control and the delay in the rancidity development of \n\nvegetable oils are the most important application of oxygen scavenging systems in food \n\npackaging.\n26\n\n Usually, these active packaging technologies make use of sachets with active \n\ncompounds, such as iron powder, ascorbic acid, photosensitive dyes and enzymes but these \n\napproaches meet some resistance due to the accidental spill and consumption of sachet \n\ncontents.\n24,25\n\n \n\n There is a growing interest in bioactive packaging through the use of natural \n\ncompounds incorporated into the polymer wall of the package in order to increase the \n\nfoods shelf-life and, at same time, prevent the oxidation of polymer by thermal \n\ndegradation. Antioxidants are widely used as food additives to improve the stability of \n\nlipids to oxidation and to prolong shelf-life of dried products and oxygen sensitive foods. \n\nThey have also been incorporated in small concentrations into plastic films to obtain \n\nadditional stability under processing conditions.\n27\u201329\n\n \n\nTherefore, the barrier properties of the packaging polymer against the transfer of small \n\ngaseous molecules, such as O2, CO2 or H2O, are important\n9\n, and should prevent food \n\ndegradation and oxidation, preserving aromas and flavours\n13\n\n. In particular, oxygen is an \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nexcellent oxidizing agent of lipids which can cause deterioration of product quality. \n\nMoreover, barrier properties against light, water vapor, atmospheric gases and larger \n\nvolatile molecules, such as aroma compounds, need to be assessed since the transfer of \n\nthese compounds into the polymer could cause a modification of the aroma formulation of \n\nthe packaged food leading to a deterioration of its quality.\n9\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.4. Scope \n \n\nThe central idea behind this thesis was to develop a biodegradable poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-\n\nbased packaging system that can provide an extended shelf life for foods and improve food \n\nsafety, improving its barrier properties. PLA, was selected for this study since it is obtained \n\nfrom natural renewable resources and presents mechanical properties comparable to \n\nhydrocarbon based polymers and with excellent flavor and odor barrier.\n30,31,32\n\n PLA is \n\nalready used as a packaging material for the storage of fresh-fruits and vegetables or foods \n\nwith short shelf-life. In order to improve PLA\u2019s barrier properties, antioxidants (natural \n\nand artificial) were incorporated in films of PLA. The objective of this study is to evaluate \n\nthe impact of the addition of three antioxidants ?-tocopherol, 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4-\n\nmethylphenol or (Butylated hydroxytoluene), BHT, and 2-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-1,4-\n\nbenzenediol or tert-Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) (Figure 12) in PLA films. For that \n\npurpose, films with different quantities of antioxidant were prepared and thermal, \n\nmechanical and barrier properties were measured so that their suitability as a polymer \n\nmaterials for food packaging can be assessed.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.

Introduction \n \n\nThe selection of a polymeric material for certain application depend on the \n\nperformance of the membrane and specially of the glass transition temperature, Tg, and the \n\ncrystallinity which are important parameters and affect directly the transfer of small \n\nmolecules through the membrane. These parameters are determined by structural factors \n\nsuch as chain flexibility, chain interaction, chain symmetry, presence of lateral chains, \n\nextent of polymer chain unsaturation, presence of polar groups in the polymer backbone, \n\norientation of the polymer chains and degree of crosslinking, cohesive energy of the \n\npolymer and molecular weight and presence of additives.\n33,34\n\n The knowledge of Tg is \n\nessential in the selection of materials for various applications. In general, values of Tg well \n\nbelow room temperature define the domain of elastomers and values above room \n\ntemperature define rigid and structural polymers, i.e., the mechanical and physical \n\nproperties change drastically over a relatively small temperature interval covering the glass \n\ntransition temperature. The glassy state of a polymer can be considered as a frozen state \n\nwith a highly restricted chain mobility.\n33\n\n However, in the presence of some substances, \n\ndepression of the glass transition may occur due to an increase on the free volume.  \n\nMost of the dense materials used as food packaging are made up of semi-crystalline \n\npolymers (PE, PP, PET) in which both phases can be distinguished: an amorphous phase \n\nand a crystalline phase (Figure 10). When the crystallization occurs in solution, the \n\npolymeric chains fold back and forth, forming folded chain lamellar crystals, connected to \n\nthe amorphous regions by polymer chains.  \n\n  \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Semi-crystalline polymer structure presenting lamellar crystals connected by polymer chains \n\n(amorphous regions). \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nIn the melted state, the polymer chains are highly entangled therefore the folding of \n\nchains during the nucleation and crystallization process is hindered.\n35\n\n Crystallization from \n\nthe melted polymer results in the formation of spherical crystal aggregates, the so-called \n\nspherulites, notably at isothermal crystallization at low supercooling.\n35\n\n \n\nTypically, polymer crystals are not in thermal equilibrium since their formation is \n\nstrongly complicated and hindered due to the connectivity of the segments, involving co-\n\noperative movements of a large number of connected monomers.\n35\n\n Although the free \n\nenergy would be lowest for fully extended crystalline molecules, long polymers usually \n\nform much thinner lamellae (\u201cchain-folding\u201d). Therefore, polymer crystals represent meta-\n\nstable states with a significant degree of disorder, mainly characterized by the degree of \n\nchain foldind.\n35\n\n  \n\nThree parameters whose role is essential when dealing with mass transfer through \n\npolymeric matrices are free volume, glass transition temperature, and crystallinity of the \n\npolymer, which are also function of previously given factors.\n34\n\n Diffusion in semicrystalline \n\npolymers is complicated by the presence of crystallites. Crystalline zones are excluded \n\nvolumes where molecules cannot sorb and increase the path that diffusing molecules must \n\npass in the membrane because they increase tortuosity and may also decrease the mobility \n\nof the amorphous polymeric chains because chain ends could be trapped in the neighboring \n\ncrystalline lamellae.\n34\n\n In the amorphous part, the diffusion mechanism is different \n\naccording to whether the membrane is in a rubbery or a glassy state at the temperature of \n\nuse (above or below of Tg).\n34\n\n Membranes in the glassy state are actually not in equilibrium \n\nbecause the time necessary for a polymer in the glassy state to relax, i.e., for its structure to \n\nrearrange in response to external changes, is long. Membranes in the rubbery state are at \n\nequilibrium and do not contain fixed regions of non equilibrium excess volume because the \n\nstructure rearranges promptly in response to external changes.\n34\n\n  \n\nThe concept of free volume is useful for explaining aspects of the chain mobility \n\nand permeability of polymers. Free volume (microvoids), including its nanostructure \n\ncharacteristics (mean size and size distribution of microcavities, their spatial arrangement \n\nand topology), determines many properties of glassy polymers and in particular, the \n\ntransport parameters of membrane materials such as permeability and diffusion coefficients \n\nof gases.\n36\n\n The relation between the free volume and the polymer mobility is frequently \n\nstudied by measuring the diffusion properties of small molecules in polymers. As a general \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nrule, gases solubility, diffusivity and permeability increase with the increase in free \n\nvolume. In semi-crystalline polymers (PP, PE, PET\u2026), free volume is linked to Tg of the \n\namorphous part.\n34\n\n Conceptually, permeation of small gas molecules through a glassy \n\npolymer is viewed as proceeding by jump motion whereby a permeant molecule spends \n\nmost of the time in free-volume cavities and occasionally jumps to a neighboring cavity.\n37\n\n  \n\nThe jump motion proceeds by formation of a channel between two neighboring holes. Thus \n\ngas permeation depends on the number and size of cavities in the polymer matrix (static \n\nfree volume) and the frequency of channel formation (dynamic free volume). Static free \n\nvolume is essentially independent of thermally accessible motions of the polymer chains \n\nand relates to gas sorption, S. Dynamic free volume derives from accessible \n\nconformational changes and segmental motions of the polymer chain and relates to gas \n\ndiffusivity, D.\n37\n\n \n\nIn recent years many efforts have been devoted to the development, formulation and \n\ncharacterization of new ecologically friendly and sustainable plastic materials that can \n\novercome the major environmental problems created by the extensive use of petrochemical \n\nbased plastics. In particular, PLA has been playing a dominant role among biorenewable \n\nresources plastics. As we mentioned in the previous section, many important properties of \n\nPLA are controlled by ratio of D- to L- enantiomers used and the sequence of arrangement \n\nof the enantiomers in the polymers. PLLA constitutes the main fraction of PLA derived \n\nfrom renewable sources since the majority of lactic acid obtained from biological sources \n\nexists as LLA. PLA with PLLA content higher than 90 % tends to be crystalline while that \n\nwith lower optical purity is amorphous. The melting temperature, Tm, glass transition \n\ntemperature, Tg, and crystallinity of PLA decrease with decreasing amounts of PLLA.\n15\n\n  \n\nThermoplastic polymers exhibit many properties ideal for use in packaging and other \n\nconsumer products, such as light weight, low process temperature (compared to metal and \n\nglass), variable barrier properties to match endues applications, good printability, heat \n\nsealable, and ease of conversion into different forms.\n38\n\n Similar to many thermoplastics \n\npolymers, semicrystalline PLA exhibits Tg and Tm. Above Tg (~58 \u00baC) PLA is rubbery, \n\nwhile below Tg, it becomes a glass. Figure 11 displays the Tg and Tm of thermoplastics \n\npolymers.\n38\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Glass transition temperature and melting temperature of PLA and other thermoplastics.\n38\n\n \n\n \n\nThe properties of PLA such as thermal stability and impact resistance are inferior to \n\nthose of conventional polymers used for thermoplastic applications.\n38\n\n The inherent \n\nbrittleness of PLA has been a major bottleneck for its large-scale commercial \n\napplications.\n39\n\n Therefore, PLA is not ideally suited to compete against the conventional \n\npolymers.\n38\n\n Despite the good mechanical properties and processability as well as \n\nbiocompatibility of PLA, to replace the polyolefins in packaging material and hygiene \n\nproducts, as diapers, and milk cartons, PLA film have to be flexible, because in the \n\nindustrial production line of packaging material as well as diapers, there is no tolerance for \n\nthe film cracking or tearing when folded or subject to force during manufacturing.\n40\n\n Since \n\nPLA is rigid and brittle with low ability to plastic deformation below glass transition \n\ntemperature, numerous approaches such as plasticization, block copolymerization, \n\nblending with tough polymers, and rubber toughening have been adopted to improve the \n\ntoughness of brittle polylactide bioplastic.\n39\n\n The major drawbacks of these methods are the \n\nsubstantial decreases in the strength and modulus of the toughened polylactide. So, a \n\npolylactide-based material having good stiffness-toughness balance along with high \n\nbiobased polylactide content is still elusive.\n39\n\n \n\nOne of the most used methods to overcome the problem of the brittleness is plasticize \n\nthe PLA in order to produce flexible films. Several types of chemicals have been tried to \n\nplasticize PLA such as citrate esters, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), glucose monoesters and \n\npartial fatty acid esters, resulting in materials with better deformation capacity and \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nresilience.\n41\n\n Also, blends of PLA with various non-biodegradable polymers, and with \n\nothers aliphatic polyesters such as poly (??caprolactone), poly(butylene succinate) and \n\npoly(hydroxy butyrate) were also reported in the literature.41 Various compounds are \n\nreported as efficient plasticizing for PLA including poly(3-methyl-1,4-dioxan-2-one), \n\npoly(ethylene oxide), citrate esters, triacetine, and poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEGs).\n42\n\n Some \n\nof these blends were found to be immiscible, resulting in fairly poor mechanical \n\nproperties.\n41\n\n  \n\nThe expansion of PLA\u00b4s application to the packaging industry passes essentially \n\nthrough the ability to tailor its gas barrier properties and flexural properties such as rigidity \n\nand brittleness, which are an expression of its low deformation at break. The choice of \n\npolymers or plasticizers to be used as modifiers for PLA is limited by the requirements of \n\nthe application. For packaging and hygiene applications, only nontoxic substances \n\napproved for food contact and personal care can be considered as plasticizing agents.\n40\n\n \n\nAntioxidants are widely used as food additives to improve the stability of lipids to \n\noxidation and to prolong shelf-life of dried products and oxygen sensitive foods. They have \n\nalso been incorporated in small concentrations in films to obtain additional stability \n\n(chemical, thermal) under processing conditions. \n27\u201329,43\u201345\n\n \n\nIn this context, antioxidant-active packaging is a promising approach to extend the \n\nshelf-life and improve safety and sensorial properties, while maintaining the food quality. \n\nSeveral antioxidants have already been incorporated into different polymeric film \n\nstructures for the intentional purpose of migration into food to prevent its oxidation.\n28,46\u201348 \n\nThe impregnation of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antioxidants, in \n\npolymeric films has also been subject of research. ?-tocopherol (the component of Vitamin \n\nE which has the highest free radical scavenging activity) is a natural antioxidant that has \n\nalready been studied as a polymer film stabilizer as well as an antioxidant. Recognized as \n\nsafe and worldwide approved for use in food applications, ?-tocopherol has been used to \n\nimprove the biostability and biocompatibility of different materials.\n43,49,50\n\n Reno et al.\n51\n\n \n\nstudied the effect of ?-tocopherol added to poly((D,L)lactic acid) for medical applications \n\nand it was verified that it alters the surface wettability. Wessling et al.\n29\n\n observed that \n\nincorporation of high levels (3600 ppm) of ?-tocopherol into LDPE films inhibits the \n\noxidation of organic acids stored in contact with the film. More recently, Byun et. al\n52\n\n \n\nclearly showed the high antioxidant activity of ?-tocopherol, by the incorporation of 1 % \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nof ?-tocopherol PLA films, which increased the radical scavenging activity from 0.84 % to \n\n90.43 %.\n52\n\n Manzanares-L\u00f3pez et al.\n53\n\n added 2.58 wt% of ?-tocopherol into PLA films and \n\nstudied the films thermal and optical properties as well as effect of the release of the \n\nantioxidant on the oxidative stability of soybean oil. No significantly effect was observed \n\non Tg and Tm. Ortiz-Vazquez et al.\n54\n\n studied the use  of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), \n\nanother antioxidant also approved by FDA, in PLA films for packaging of coconut oil and \n\nconcluded that the addition of 0.79 wt.% of BHT to the PLA film had no effect on thermal, \n\noxygen and water barrier properties of the PLA films.  \n\nNevertheless, recent contradictory results show that the addition of 1 wt.% of synthetic \n\nphenolic antioxidants including BHT, butylated hydroxyanisole, tert-butylhydroquinone \n\n(TBHQ) and propyl gallate had no significant effect on the glass transition and melting \n\ntemperature, water vapour and oxygen permeability of PLA films.\n55\n\n However, Hwang et \n\nal. \n56\n\n demonstrated that the combination effect of two natural antioxidants (?-tocopherol \n\nand resveratrol) with differing concentrations can play a critical role on the thermal and \n\nmechanical properties of PLLA films.  \n\nIn conclusion, the available literature only addresses the incorporation of very small \n\namounts of antioxidant and most studies only assess rates, effects and release mechanisms \n\nof the antioxidants.  This chapter explores the incorporation of antioxidants into PLA \n\nfilms and their effect on thermal, surface and mechanical properties. For that purpose, three \n\nantioxidants were selected, one natural (?-tocopherol) and two synthetic (BHT and \n\nTBHQ). ?-tocopherol, a lipid-soluble antioxidant that has already been intensively studied \n\nas a polymer film stabilizer, was chosen due to its highest free radical scavenging \n\nactivity.\n57\n\n BHT and TBHQ are commonly used in food industry and were chosen because \n\nthey have similar structures but different molar volumes.\n55\n\n The chemical structures of the \n\nantioxidants used in this work are shown in Figure 12. \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\na\n\nb\nc\n\n \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Chemical structures of antioxidants used in this work. a)-?-tocopherol, b)- 2,6-bis(1,1-\ndimethylethyl)-4-methylphenol or (Butylated hydroxytoluene) BHT  and c)- 2-(1,1-Dimethylethyl)-1,4-\n\nbenzenediol or tert-Butylhydroquinone (TBHQ)). \n\n \n\nBHT is a lipid-soluble antioxidant commonly used in the plastics, pharmaceutical \n\nand food industries. BHT terminates free-radical chain reactions by donating hydrogen \n\natoms to free radicals producing more stable compounds. In the U.S.A., direct addition of \n\nBHT to some food emulsion is specifically regulated, but this antioxidant is generally \n\nrecognized as safe for use in food when the total content of antioxidants is not over 0.02 % \n\nof the fat or oil content\n54\n\n.  \n\n2.2. Experimental \n \n\n2.2.1. Materials \n \n\n \n\nLinear poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with (L:D) ratio of 98:2 with molecular weight of \n\n87,131 Da and density of 1.26 \u00d7 10\n-3 \n\nkg/m\n3\n \n\n13\n was kindly provided by Cargill-Dow \n\nPolymers (USA) in the form of pellets. (\u00b1) ?-tocopherol with assay ? 97 % and Tert-\n\nbutylhydroquinone (TBHQ) with assay ? 98 % were supplied from Fluka (Sintra, \n\nPortugal). Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), 99 % purity, was obtained from SAFC Global \n\n(Lisboa, Portugal). Dichoromethane was supplied from Sigma-Aldrich (Sintra, Portugal) \n\nwith analytical reagent grade. Solvents were used with no further purification. \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\n2.2.2. Samples preparation \n \n\n \n\n PLA films with and without antioxidants were prepared from solutions with 60 mg/ml  \n\nof PLA in dichloromethane. Different amounts of AT, BHT and TBHQ to the PLA were \n\nadded to obtain solutions with concentrations of 2 wt%, 4 wt %, 6 wt% and 10 wt% of \n\neach antioxidants to the polymer. All the solutions were magnetically stirred during at least  \n\n12 h for complete dissolution Thin films were prepared by casting each solution into Petri \n\ndishes and dichloromethane was left to evaporate at room temperature from 24 h in the \n\ndark place (cabinet) to avoid antioxidants degradation. Solvent evaporation took place \n\nslowly in order to obtain homogeneous films. Structural, mechanical, thermal and barrier \n\nproperties were investigated. \n\n \n\n2.2.3. Film Characterization \n \n\n2.2.3.1. Infra-red spectroscopy \n \n\nAttenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infra-Red (ATR-FTIR) spectrophotometer, \n\nFT Bruker IFS 55, was used to obtain spectra of thin films co-adding 256 scans at a \n\nresolution of 8 cm\n-1\n\n. Spectra were collected from 4000 to 400 cm\n-1\n\n.  \n\n \n\n2.2.3.2. Optical microscopy \n \n\nMicroscope Olympus BX51 with polarized light was used to observe the effect of ?-\n\ntocopherol on the growth and morphology of spherulites when a sample is subjected to \n\nthermal treatment by melting and subsequent annealing at temperature above Tg or \n\nquenched at temperature 0 \u00baC. The study of the crystallite growth was achieved using films \n\nwhich were melted at 200 \u00baC for 3 minutes, and then crystallized at the annealing \n\ntemperature of 140 \u00baC for 60 minutes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n2.2.3.3. Dynamic mechanical analysis \n \n\nRectangular specimens of the films prepared were tested in a dynamic mechanical \n\nanalyzer Tritec 2000 DMA, Triton Technology Ltd. Displacement and force amplitudes \n\nwere adjusted according to samples for a single cantiliver bending deformation mode. The \n\nexperiments were done at 1 Hz of frequency in temperature range from 30 \u00baC to 100 \u00baC \n\nwith heating rate of 2 \u00baC/min. The storage modulus or Young\u2019s modulus and the \n\ndissipation factor, tan ?, with temperature were monitored.  \n\n \n\n2.2.3.4. Thermal properties \n \n\n The dynamic degradation was carried using a thermogravimetric analyser \n\nShimadzu TGA-50. The dynamic tests were run at a heating rate of 10 K/min from room \n\ntemperature up to 773 K and in nitrogen environment (flow rate 20 mL/min) to guarantee \n\nthe constancy of atmosphere during the whole test. Samples between 4 and 20 mg were \n\nused without any previous treatment.  \n\nA differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Shimadzu DSC-50/DTA-50, was used to \n\ndetermine the antioxidant effects on the glass transition temperature (Tg), melting \n\ntemperature (Tm) and degree of crystallinity (\nc\n\n? ) of the PLA films. About 5 mg of each \n\nfilm sample was weighed in an aluminum pan, and were subjected to the following three \n\nDSC runs at 10 K/min: i) heating from 263 K to 523 K; ii) cooling from 523 K to 263 K, \n\nand finally iii) heating from 263 K to 523 K. The first scan is used to measure the \n\ncrystallization percentage, considering 93.6 J/g for a 100 % crystalline L-PLA\n58\n\n and the \n\nsecond scan is used to calculate the glass transition temperature without polymer stress. \n\nThe experiments were carried out under constant nitrogen atmosphere. The transition \n\ntemperature as well as the enthalpy of melting (7Hm) was calibrated using indium as the \n\nstandard. The degree of crystallinity of the PLA films was calculated according to the \n\nfollowing equation:  \n\n \n\n( ) 100%\n0\n\n\u00d7\n?\n\n???\n=\n\nm\n\ncm\n\nc\nH\n\nHH\n\n?\n?

Scanning electron microscopy \n \n\nThe morphology of the resulting membranes was characterized by Ultra-high \n\nResolution Analytical Scanning Electron Microscope HR-FESEM Hitachi SU-70 \n\nequipment operating at 15 kV. To increase the conductivity, a carbon coating was \n\ndeposited on top of all film samples. \n\n \n\n2.2.3.6. Atomic force microscopy AFM) \n \n\nFor atomic force microscopy (AFM) observation, a NanoScope III scanning \n\nmicroscope equipped with a hot-stage accessory (Digital Instruments) was used. All \n\nexperiments were carried out in the tapping mode. AFM height, amplitude and phase \n\nimages were recorded simultaneously. Resolutions of 256\u00d7256 data points per image were \n\nused to collect the images. Si tips (PPP-NCHR) with a resonance frequency of \n\napproximately 320 kHz and a spring constant of about 40 N/m were used. The scanning \n\nrate was 0.5 Hz.  \n\n2.2.3.7. X-ray diffraction (XRD) \n \n\nA Philips X-ray diffractometer X\u2019Pert model equipped with a (CuK?) source was \n\nused to study the crystallites growth in films subjected to different thermal treatments. The \n\nanalysis was performed at 25 \u00baC with a 2? range of 5\u00ba- 40\u00ba using a scan speed of 1 \u00ba/min.  \n\n \n\n2.2.3.8. Contact angle measurements \n \n\nContact angle (?) measurements with water, formamide, ethylene glycol and \n\ndiiodomethane were performed at room temperature using a surface energy evolution \n\nsystem coupled with a video camera and image analysis software commercialized by Brno \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nUniversity (Brno, Czech Republic). Each ? value is the average of five independent \n\ndeterminations acquired immediately after the drop deposition. These values were used to \n\ncalculate the polar and dispersive components of the surface energy of PLA films using the \n\nOwens-Wendt\u2019s approach. \n59\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3. Results and discussion \n \n\n \n\nBefore beginning the characterization of the films by different techniques, it is important to \n\ndescribe the appearance of the films after enriched PLA with the different antioxidants. \n\nThe PLA films had different appearance depending on the antioxidant used. PLA films \n\ncontaining ?-tocopherol have become yellowish over time while the films with BHT were \n\nvery similar to neat PLA, becaming opaque. The brittleness remained in films containing \n\nthe two antioxidants. Finally, PLA blended with TBHQ films were the most interesting, \n\nbecause the membranes were transparent and significantly more flexible. From visual \n\ninspection we can conclude that PLA/TBHQ films should be less crystalline that the other \n\nantioxidants enriched films. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Infra-red spectroscopy \n\nThe infrared spectra of PLA and PLA enriched with various concentrations of antioxidants \n\nfilms were recorded in the spectral region of 3500 to 500 cm\n-1 \n\nand are presented in Figure \n\n13 for ?-tocopherol, Figure 14 for TBHQ and  Figure 15 for BHT. In Figure 13, the \n\nincrease in the intensity of the band at 3000 cm\n-1\n\n with the increase in the amount of ?-\n\ntocopherol in films confirms that the additivation procedure was successful. The control of \n\nPLA structure is done using the band at 1748 cm\n-1\n\n, corresponding to C=O stretching. \n\n400 800 1200 1600 2000 2400 2800 3200 3600\n\nA\nb\n\ns\no\n\nr\nv\n\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nWavenumber (cm-1)\n\nNeat PLA \n\nPLA/?-TC-2.2 % \n\nPLA/?-TC-4.4% \n\n????C-H CO2\n\n????C=O\n\n \nFigure 13 \u2013 ATR-FTIR spectra of PLA and enriched PLA with ?-tocopherol films. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 shows the spectra of TBHQ, neat PLA and PLA enriched with TBHQ (4,4 wt%). \n\nIn the film of PLA/TBHQ spectrum, we can observe the appearance of the characteristic \n\nbands of TBHQ, thus confirming the presence of the antioxidant in the film. The broad \n\nband at 3508 cm\n-1\n\n can be assigned to the \u2013OH stretch of the phenol, which usually appears \n\nat 3445 and 3279 cm\n-1\n\n, or \u2013OH free from PLA which usually appears at 3571 cm\n-1\n\n, or both. \n\nThe bands from 2994 to 2874 cm\n-1\n\n are assigned to the CH stretching region (CH3(asym), \n\nCH3(sym), and CH modes) of PLA and =C- (alkenes, aromatics) from TBHQ. The phenyl \n\nring and \u2013C-OH in plane are responsible for bands at 1590, 1490 and 1442 cm\n-1\n\n in TBHQ. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\nNear these bands, the ?asCH3 stretching of PLA appears at about 1452 cm\n-1\n\n. The weak \n\nband at about 1500 cm\n-1 \n\nshould be then assigned at phenyl ring and \u2013C-OH in the plane \n\nbending. The increased intensity of the band at 1360 cm\n-1\n\n and the band at 1310 cm\n-1\n\n are \n\nassigned to the methyl bending vibration (?sCH3 + ?CH), found in both PLA and TBHQ. \n\nThe bands at 810 and 775 cm\n-1\n\n are assigned to \u2013CH out of plan and ring torsion of the \n\nTBHQ.   \n\n \n\n2500 2700 2900 3100 3300 3500\n\nA\nb\n\ns\no\n\nr\nb\n\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nWavenumber (cm-1)\n\n5eat PLA\n\nTBHQ\n\nPLA/TBHQ\n\n600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 2000\n\nA\nb\n\ns\no\n\nr\nb\n\na\nn\n\nc\ne\n\nWavenumber (cm-1)\n\n5eat PLA\n\nTBHQ\n\nPLA/TBHQ\n\n \n\nFigure 14 - ATR-FTIR spectra of PLA and enriched PLA with TBHQ films. \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nThe bands that are assigned to BHT found in the additivated films, ensures presence of this \n\ncompound in the films.

Optical microscopy \n \n\nThe enhancement of the thermal stability of PLA is a matter that has been receiving a large \n\namount of attention, both from the processing and the application point of view. The effect \n\nof ?-tocopherol in the density of spherulites when the films are melted followed by \n\nannealing at a crystallization temperature (Tc) above the Tg can be evaluated from the \n\nFigure 16. The polarizing optical micrographs show an increase in the number of \n\nspherulites with the increase of ?-tocopherol content in the films. However, no spherulites \n\nare observed when the films are melted and quenched at 0 \u00baC. So, the overall \n\ncrystallization of PLA enriched with ?-tocopherol can be scrupulously selected and the \n\nfinal properties of films should be very well analyzed. As the crystallites can cause \n\ntortuosity, the present study on the effect of ?-tocopherol on sorption of gases in \n\nadditivated films will be performed using the last procedure to prepare our films, i.e., \n\ncompletely amorphous films.  \n\n \n\nFigure 16 - Photomicrographs of the films annealed at 140 \u00baC from the melt for PLA enriched with 0 wt%, \n\n2.2 wt% and 4.4 wt% of ?-tocopherol. \n\n \n\n2.3.3. Dynamic mechanical analysis  \n \n\nDynamic mechanical spectra of samples, including PLA with 2.2 % and 4.4 % of \n\n??tocopherol are shown in Figure 17. Polymeric properties are temperature-dependent. \n\nPlastics are hard and rigid at room temperature  (20\u00ba C), but become softer at high \n\ntemperature. This hardness or stiffness is measured as a modulus, a ratio of stress to strain \n\nat a certain stage of deformation. The decrease in Young\u2019s modulus (E\u2019) of samples is \n\naccompanied by a peak in the viscous dissipation, tan ? (Figure 18). Lower modulus values \n\n\n\n35 \n\n \n\nare found in films with higher concentrations of ?-tocopherol. A decrease of 37 % and 41 \n\n% for 2.2 % and 4.4 % were observed. This behaviour is similar to that found in plasticized \n\nfilms with glycerol, PEG or OLA by Martin et al \n60\n\n and suggests that the material became \n\nmore flexible in the presence of ?-tocopherol, i.e., lower storage modulus shows that the \n\nsoftness increases with addition of ?-tocopherol content.  \n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n290 340 390\n\nE\n' \n(M\n\nP\na\n\n)\n\nTemperature (K)\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 \u2013 Young\u2019s modulos of PLA and enriched ?-tocopherol PLA (\u2014) neat PLA, (- - -) PLA/?-\ntocopherol 2.2 wt%, (\u2014 .\n\n \n\u2014) PLA/?-tocopherol 4.4 wt%. \n\n \n\nBecause the tan ? peaks related to glass transition of enriched films with ?-tocopherol  are \n\nvery weak and broad, it was not possible the determination of Tg. Shibata et al \n61\n\n \n\nassociated the broadening of the tan ? at a slight compatibility between two phases.

Of the \n\nthree antioxidants, TBHQ might act as a thermal stabilizer for the PLA/antioxidant films.  \n\n The DSC thermogram obtained during the first heating of the samples enriched \n\nwith BHT 2 % wt and TBHQ 2 % wt are presented in Figure 22 and shows that the films \n\nenriched with TBHQ exhibits a broad crystallization in the range 350 K - 400 K, centered \n\nat about 378 K.  This peak reflects the large amorphous component in the cooled \n\nPLA/TBHT film. When the polymer is heating, the molecules acquire thermal energy, and \n\nat glass transition temperature, the molecules have enough energy to overcome the \n\nintermolecular forces and they have more freedom of movement. The amorphous region \n\nbecomes rubbery and the polymer become soft and flexible. With heat, the molecules in \n\namorphous phase  have mobility to arrange themselves into an ordered crystal. \n\nCrystallisation is an exothermic process, and a correspondent peak appears in the \n\nthermogram. During the first heating, this arranges crystalline appears in the same range of \n\ntemperatures only for PLA enriched films with TBHQ and have a centered peak about 378 \n\nK to 2 wt% and 5 wt% of TBHQ and  374 K for PLA enriched with 10 wt% TBHQ, i.e., \n\nthe TC obtained from the first heating of the PLA/TBHQ films shift to lower temperatures \n\n(Figure 23). During the cooling, the amount of TBHQ decrease the enthalpy of \n\ncrystallization, and causes a band broadening centered at about 369 K (Figure 24). \n\nPLA/BHT enriched films do not exhibit crystallization during the first heating. The Figure \n\n23 and Figure 25 show that PLA films enriched with both antioxidants TBHQ and BHT \n\nexhibits a crystallisation peak in second heating. The rearrange that occurs in this heating \n\nshould be of the crystals formed during the cooling after the first heating, are therefore of \n\ndifferent nature from that appears in the first heat of PLA/TBHQ, ones formed from the \n\nsolution and the other from the melted.

The highest Tc = 396 K was \n\nobtained for PLA with 5 wt% of TBHQ, more 12 K than neat PLA. In the samples with \n\nthermal treatment by DSC, the crystallization occurred around 390 K for all samples, more \n\n6 K than for neat PLA.   \n\nFor films without thermal treatment by DSC, the crystallinity of PLA/TBHQ films \n\nseems to be independent of the antioxidant content and is about 61 % lower than neat PLA. \n\nThe crystallinity increase 1 % relatively at neat PLA for 2 wt % of BHT and then decrease \n\n11 % to 5 % and 10 wt %  of BHT.  \n\nNeat PLA melted in DSC presents a crystallinity of 20 %, i.e., 56 % lower than \n\nwithout thermal treatment. The crystallinity of PLA/BHT melted films decrease with the \n\namount of BHT into the film, from 16 % to 9 % to 2 wt % and 10 wt % of BHT, \n\nrespectively. For enriched films with TBHQ, the crystallinity is almost constant ~12 % and  \n\nindependent of the amount of TBHQ in the film.  \n\nMelted pure PLA exhibited a Tg around 331 K and a melting temperature, around \n\n438 K. The addition 2 wt % of BHT increase 3 K the Tg, and 10 wt %  of BHT decrease 5 \n\nK. It is thought that the increase of Tg with small amounts of ??? disturb the mobility of \n\namorphous PLA. The presence of strong interactions between the PLA and BHT seems to \n\noccur, despite the fact that the presence of aromatic rings in the backbone should have a \n\nmore dramatic effect on Tg. Their presence seems to hinder the lateral polymer chains to \n\nmoving, acting as a filler. At high concentrations of antioxidants, we can observe a small \n\nplasticizer effect, since the Tg decrease about 5 K relatively at neat PLA. Similar results \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\nwere found for PLA/TBHQ films. The Tg decrease with the amount of TBHQ into the \n\nfilm, decreasing only 6 K to 10 wt% of antioxidant. The melting temperature decrease 4 K \n\nfor BHT and 3 K for TBHQ, both BHT and TBHQ 10 wt%. \n\nWhat happens with ?-tocopherol, a large molecule compared with BHT and TBHQ \n\ncompounds?

The ?-\n\ntocopherol causes an opposite effect on Tc than the other antioxidants, while BHT and \n\nTBHQ shift the TC to higher temperatures, ?-tocopherol shift to lower temperature. \n\nCrystallization temperature decrease to 342 K with the incorporation of 8 wt % of ?-\n\ntocopherol, a decrease of 42 K when compared to that of neat PLA.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nTable 5 - Thermal properties of PLA films containing different percents of antioxidants (second \n\nheating). \n\nSample Tg(K) TC (K) ?HC  (J/g) Tm  (K) ?Hm (J/g) ?(%) \n\nNeat PLA 331 384 16.0 438 36,9 20 \n\nPLA/BHT-2 334 388 21.5 439 36,6 16 \n\nPLA/BHT-5 330 390 20.4 436 33,5 15 \n\nPLA/BHT-10 326 389 25.6 434 33,4 9 \n\nPLA/TBHQ-2 330 392 19.4 438 31,8 13 \n\nPLA/TBHQ-5 327 396 22.8 436 33,5 12 \n\nPLA/TBHQ-10 325 393 20.2 435 30,6 12 \n\nPLA/?-tocopherol-2 330 358 25.6 438 39.9 16 \n\nPLA/?-tocopherol-4 325 356 22.4 437 35,4 14 \n\nPLA/?-tocopherol-6 321 349 22.1 438 35,9 16 \n\nPLA/?-tocopherol-8 320 342 20.3 437 41,3 25 \n\n \n\n The crystallinity does not change with the amount of ?-tocopherol content in the \n\nfilm up to 6 % and then increases to about twice from 16 % to 25 % to 8 wt% of ?-\n\ntocopherol. No significantly changes were observed for melting temperature. For 8 % of ?-\n\ntocopherol, the Tg decrease 11 K, indicating that ??tocopherol behaves as a plasticizant, \n\ni.e. increasing the mobility of PLA chains in the amorphous regions, thus allowing more \n\nrearrangements of polymer chains and consequently higher crystallinity. Piorkowska et \n\nal.\n62\n\n have obtained a similar result when PLA was plasticized with poly(propylene glycol), \n\nPPG.  \n\nIn what concerns the glass transition temperature, a decrease of 11 K for when to 8 wt \n\n% of ?-tocopherol content into the film was observed. Overall, the antioxidants \n\nincorporation into PLA increases the free volume of the polymer matrix and consequently \n\npromotes the enhancement of polymer chain mobility. Therefore, these antioxidants \n\npossibly act as plasticizers in the PLA matrix. It is well known that the addition of low \n\nmolecular weight compounds decreases PLA rigidity and brittleness by reducing its glass \n\ntransition temperature.\n59\n\n The results obtained in this work for antioxidants concentrations \n\nabove 2 wt % are in agreement with some works which demonstrate that PLA melting \n\npoint shifts to lower temperatures with the addition of different plasticizers\n59\n\n, however the \n\nincorporation of only 2 wt % of each antioxidant into PLA films did not affect the melting \n\ntemperature. Manzanares-L\u00f3pez et al \n53\n\n and Jamshidian et al.\n55\n\n  found similar results \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nregarding the melting temperature after the incorporation of 2.58 wt% ?-tocopherol and 1 \n\nwt% BHT, respectively, into PLA. However, the results here obtained contradict those of \n\nJamshidian et al.\n63\n\n, who showed that the melting point of PLA decreases about 8 K with \n\nthe incorporation of only 2 wt% ?-tocopherol. Table 6 presents a short summary of the \n\neffect of the antioxidants incorporation into PLA, by different processes. Films extruded \n\nare formed from the melted, whereas those formed by casting are from the solution. Then \n\nthe results obtained from the first heating can be compared with the casting and the results \n\nobtained from the second heating can be compared with the extruded films.  \n\n \n\nTable 6 - Thermal properties of PLA films containing different percents of antioxidants from others \n\nworks. \n\nPLA (wt % ) compound \nMethod for Film \n\npreparation \nTg Tm Tc ?

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) \n \n\nEnriched films with antioxidants were crio-fractured in order to examine the \n\nmicrostructure aspects. Photomicrographs of blended films of PLA with 2 % of ?-\n\ntocopherol fracture revealed formation of voids, considerable ductile tearing and \n\ninhomogeneity. PLA/BHT 2 wt% revealed absence of ductile tearing as in neat PLA and \n\nan integrity at the surface. PLA/TBHQ 2% wt revealed considerable ductile tearing, rough \n\nsurface and integrity at the surface. Some powder grains can also be observed (Figure 27). \n\nBHT enriched films maintain the brittle failure of the PLA.   \n\n \n\nFigure 27 \u2013 SEM micrographs of fracture surfaces of blends with 2 % of each antioxidant. \n\n \n\nThe voids are present in the ?-tocopherol film with 5 % ?-tocopherol. However the film \n\nseems to be more homogeneous  than a previous sample with 2 % of ?-tocopherol (Figure \n\n28). A dramatically difference appears in TBHQ 5 wt% film, that revealed homogeneity, \n\nincrease of ductile tearing and a completely smooth surface. The increase of TBHQ seems \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nto improve the compatibility with PLA. Both films are less bright, which can be due the \n\nless crystallinity. Films of PLA/BHT 5wt% revealed brittle failure, and the presence of \n\nsome powder grains (Figure 29).  \n\n \n  \n\n \n\nFigure 28 \u2013 SEM micrographs of fracture surfaces of blends with 5 % of each antioxidant. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 29 \u2013 SEM micrographs of fracture surfaces /surfaces of blends with 5 % of each antioxidant. \n\n \n\n \n\n\u00d72.00 K (20.0 \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5m) \u00d72.00 K (20.0 \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5m) \n\n\u00d7500 (100 \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5m) \u00d7500 (100 \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5m) \n\n\u00d7500 (100 \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5m) \n\n\u00d7500 (100 \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5m) \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nFinally, micrographs of PLA films enriched with 10 wt% of antioxidants are shown in \n\nFigure 30. The addition of large amounts of these antioxidants does not seem to improve \n\nthe structural characteristics of the films, PLA/BHT seems now to be very homogeneous \n\nsurface, indicating ductile tearing of the films. Films with 10 wt% of ?-tocopherol revealed \n\ninhomogeneity, formation of voids and absence of ductile tearing. This is an indication of \n\nphase separation due to incompatibility of the antioxidant with the PLA, and brittle failure. \n\nVery smooth films were formed by addition of TBHQ.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 30 \u2013 SEM micrographs of fracture surfaces /surfaces of blends with 10 % of each antioxidant. \n\n \n\nFigure 31 and Figure 32 show that at above a certain concentration an incompatibility, \n\nimmiscibility, between the selected antioxidants occurs, due to the hydrophobic character \n\nof ?-tocopherol and BHT conferred by their hydrocarbon chains. These incompatibilities \n\ncause morphological changes in the PLA film structure, which can be clearly seen in the \n\nSEM micrographs. \n\n\u00d7500 (100 \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5m) \n\n\u00d7500 (100 \u00b5\u00b5\u00b5\u00b5m) \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nPLA PLA/????-TC 2 wt% PLA/????-TC4wt% PLA/????-TC 8wt% \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 31 \u2013 SEM micrographs of surface of PLA with and without ?-tocopherol (?-TC). \n\n \n\nIn conclusion, TBHQ has better compatibility with PLA and its addition provides a \n\nsignificant flexural enhancement of PLA. The increase of crystallinity for high \n\nconcentrations of ?-tocopherol should result from the phase separations, because the \n\naggregates of ?-tocopherol trap the PLA and improve the interaction, promoting the \n\ncrystals formation.  \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 32 \u2013 SEM micrographs of the pure PLA films with 4 and 10 wt% of ?-tocopherol or BHT \nincorporated. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\n2.3.6. X-ray and AFM \n \n\nFigure 33 shows the X-ray diffraction data of neat PLA and enriched PLA with ?-\n\ntocopherol. These films were not subject to a thermal treatment. Neat PLA exhibits a \n\ncrystalline peak at 2? about 12\u00ba, which agree with data previously published with \n\ncharacteristic peaks at 2? about 12.5, 14.7, 16.6, 19.1 and 22.3 \u00baC.64 This peak vanish with \n\nthe addition of ?-tocopherol, this seems to hinder the mobility of the chains of the polymer \n\nand consequently the formation of the crystals. The films containing ?-tocopherol 2 and 6 \n\nwt % present a broad amorphous peak from PLA around 16\u00ba, confirming that PLA has an \n\namorphous microstructure (Figure 34). From AFM observation, it can be concluded that \n\nthe samples resultants of the addition of ?-tocopherol have a smoother surface compared \n\nwith the uneven rough surface of neat PLA (Figure 35 and Figure 36). Since X-ray give us \n\nonly results from whole volume of sample, the AFM was used as complementary analysis, \n\nbecause showing only the surface image. The combination of both techniques allows to \n\nconclude where the ordered crystalline phase is, and in the case of neat PLA is placed \n\ndeeper, i.e., into internal layers of films. The smoothness of the surface films containing \n\nantioxidant may be due to its plasticizer effect.  \n\n \n\n6 11 16 21 26 31 36\n\nI\nn\n\nte\nn\n\ns\nit\n\ny\n\n2????

Contact angles and surface energy \n \n\n \n\nThe water contact angle value measured on the pure PLA film (65\u00ba) is in good agreement \n\nwith the literature, which ranges from 69\u00ba to 87\u00ba.\n59\n\n The enhancement of the hydrophobic \n\ncharacter of the PLA film surface with the antioxidants incorporation was clearly shown by \n\nthe increase of water contact angles from 76.5\u00ba to the highest value 98.5\u00ba for PLA-10 wt% \n\n?-tocopherol. This increment can be attributed to the hydrophobic nature of each \n\nantioxidant and demonstrates the decreased wettability of PLA films by the antioxidants \n\nincorporation. Jamshidian et al. \n55\n\n observed exactly the same behaviour for PLA-BHT and \n\nPLA-TBHQ films, but with less pronounced effects since only 1 wt.% of antioxidant was \n\nadded. Moreover, Hwang et al. \n56\n\n also concluded that the water contact angles of PLA \n\nfilms additivated with both AT and revesratrol slightly increase when compared to that of \n\nneat PLA films.

On the \n\nother hand, the surface energy of the ?-tocopherol/PLA films decreases with the ?-\n\ntocopherol content essentially due to the reduction of the polar component, which can be \n\nlinked to the non-polar aliphatic chain of this natural antioxidant. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n2.4. Conclusion \n\n \nAddition effects of ?-tocopherol, BHT and TBHQ on physical, mechanical, structural \n\nand morphological properties of solvent-casted PLA films were studied. Enriched films \n\nwith ?-tocopherol became yellowish, which is not desirable in terms of consumer \n\nacceptability. SEM images of membranes enriched with BHT show that the miscibility of \n\nBHT and PLA was not good, and the powder agglomerates increase with the BHT content \n\nincrease. PLA/BHT 2 wt% membranes revealed a cohesive structure with brittleness \n\nfailure. The method used to produce enriched films with ?-tocopherol needs to be \n\nimproved since the membranes revealed inhomogeneity at lower concentration and for \n\nhigher concentrations phase separation occurs. TBHQ seems to be the best antioxidant, \n\nbecause the films were transparent, smooth, with good flexibility (visible evaluation). \n\nHowever, this antioxidant decreases the crystallinity, and as we know, reduction of \n\ncrystallinity is a negative point regarding mechanical and barrier properties. This was the \n\nonly antioxidant that seems to improve the thermal stability, despite the reduction of the \n\ncrystallinity. Membranes obtained with 2 wt% of TBHQ revealed some powder. However, \n\nfor higher contents of TBHQ no powder is visible and the flexibility increases, while the \n\ncrystallinity remains constant.

Introduction \n \n\n \n\nThe piezoelectricity was first detected in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. This \n\nproperty feature of some materials is based on an electric potential produced when a \n\nmaterial, such as a quartz crystal, is subjected to mechanical stress. Piezoelectric crystal \n\nsensors are passive solid-state electronic devices, which can respond to changes in \n\ntemperature, pressure, and most importantly, to changes in physical properties at the \n\ninterface between the device surface and a foreign fluid or solid. Such changes in physical \n\nproperties include variation in interfacial mass density, elasticity, viscosity, and layer \n\nthickness.\n65\n\n The incorporation of various chemically sensitive layers has enabled the \n\ntransition from the microbalance to the mass sensor and gave rise to an explosive growth \n\nof piezoelectric sensors in recent years. This type of sensor operates by observation of the \n\npropagation of an acoustic wave through the solid-state device. Sensing is achieved by  \n\ncorrelating acoustic wave-propagation variations to the amount of analyte captured at the \n\nsurface and then to the amount or concentration of analyte present in the sample exposed to \n\nthe sensor, or to the changes of physical properties of interfacial thin films.\n65\n\n A selective \n\nsensor is obtained when a sensor surface is coated with a selectively interacting thin film.\n65\n\n \n\nThis sensor principle employing bulk acoustic waves (BAW) was introduced by King\n65\n\n in \n\n1964 with the construction of his piezoelectric sorption detector.\n65\n\n There are two types of \n\npiezoelectric crystal sensors: the AT-cut quartz crystal sensor using BAW, the other is \n\nbased on surface waves (SAW) device (Figure 37). \n65\n\n \n\nIn 1959, Sauerbrey introduced a new method for mass measurements, using the \n\nchange in the frequency of a quartz resonator to measure the mass of a film adherently \n\ndeposited on the quartz resonator surface.\n66\n\n The Sauerbrey\u2019s mass measuring instrument \n\nwas named quartz crystal microbalance, QCM.\n66\n\n QCM is a thickness-shear-mode acoustic \n\nwave sensor, generally used as a microgravimetric sensor. A thin mass layer deposited on \n\nthe surface of the quartz crystal can be measured according to the decrease of the resonant \n\nfrequency. The frequency is the most accurately quantity that can be measured, of the order \n\nof ?f/f0=10\n-7, \n\n10\n-8\n\n, which corresponds to a mass of the order of a nanogram\n \nin the case of \n\nstandard QCMs of 9 MHz.\n67\n\n  The decrease of the resonant frequency of a thickness shear \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nvibrating quartz crystal resonator, having AT or BT cut (AT or BT expressed the \n\ncrystallographic orientations of the quartz resonator), is proportional to the added mass of \n\nthe deposited film:\n66\n\n \n\n \n\nA\n\nm\nf\n\nA9\n\nmf\nf\n\nf\n\nq\n\nq\n\nfq\n\nr\n\n?\n\u00d7?=\n\n?\n?=? 26\n\n2\n\n103.2 \n?\n\n                                                                                        (2) \n\nwhere f?  is the resonant frequency shift due to layer (Hz), qf is the resonant \n\nfrequency of the quartz (MHz), 9  the frequency constant of the specific crystal cut \n\n(NAT=1.67\u00d710\n5\n Hz.cm; NBT=2.5\u00d710\n\n5\n Hz.cm), \n\nq\n? =2.649 kg/dm3 the quartz density, A the \n\nsurface area of the deposited film (cm\n2\n) and \n\nf\nm?

Gas/Vapor Sorption Models \n \n\n \n\nThe sorption of a gas in a polymer film can display a variety of behaviours. There \n\nare three main types of vapour sorption isotherms in glassy polymers, as shown in Figure \n\n38. The concentration of penetrant gas/vapour is represented in the y-axis and the activity \n\nof the gas in the x-axis. \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 38 \u2013 vapour sorption isotherms in glassy polymers.\n76\n\n \n\n \n\nType 1 is concave towards the activity axis at low activities and almost linear at \n\nhigher activities Figure 38a). Most of the vapour sorption isotherms in glassy polymers \n\ndisplay Type 1 diagrams.\n76\n\n Type 2, usually referred to as BET type II, is a sigmoidal \n\nisotherm, which is concave towards the abscissa at low activities and convex at high \n\nactivities, as illustrated in Figure 38b). There is an inflection point in the isotherm. Many \n\nvapour sorption isotherms in glassy polymers also display this behaviour.\n76\n\n Type 3 is \n\nalways convex towards the activity axis, as shown in Figure 38c). Only a few of vapour \n\nsorption isotherms in glassy polymers belong to this type.\n76\n\n  \n\nDepending on the specific characteristics of the vapour-polymer system, different \n\nmathematical models have been proposed to describe and analyse the sorption results \n\nobtained. The interpretation of the sorption phenomena based on these models may lead to \n\ninteresting conclusions since the model coefficients are usually linked to properties that \n\nhave a role in the sorption mechanism. In particular, the dual-mode sorption model \n\n(DMSM) has been widely used to correlate the solubility of gases in glassy polymers films. \n\nThis model assumes that sorption takes place by two distinct modes: one that follows the \n\nHenry\u2019s law and the other a Langmuir adsorption isotherm.\n77\n\n Analytically, these two \n\ncontributions can be given by equation (5):  \n\n \n\nHD\nCC += C                                                                                                                                                   (5) \n\n \n\nwere \nD\n\nC and \nH\n\nC  are the penetrant concentrations by Henry\u2019s law mode and Langmuir \n\nmode, respectively, represented by equations (6) and (7): \n\n  \n\npkC\nDD\n\n=                                                                                                                                                         (6) \n\n\n\n60 \n\n \n\n \n\nbp\n\nbpC\nC H\n\nH\n+\n\n?\n=\n\n1\n                                                                                                                                          (7) \n\n \n\n            \n\nThen, equation (8) express analytically the DMSM:  \n\n \n\n \nbp\n\nbpC\npk\n\nH\n\nD\n+\n\n?\n+=\n\n1\n C                                                                                                                                         (8) \n\n \n\nwere \nD\n\nk  is the Henry\u2019s law dissolution constant; b is the microvoid affinity constant; \nH\n\nC? is \n\nthe Langmuir saturation constant. \n\nWhile DMSM has encountered an enormous success in the description of gas or \n\nvapour sorption isotherms concave towards the activity axis, only the engaged species \n\ninduced clustering (ENSIC) model is able to describe isotherms convex towards the \n\nactivity or pressure axis.\n78\n\n The model considers the probability of insertion of one non-\n\npolymeric solute molecule (e.g. gas, vapour or solvent) in a polymer/solvent matrix \n\ncontaining only two types of species (i.e. the polymer and the sorbed molecule), one (the \n\npolymer) being present only in the condensed phase.\n78\n\n The sorption process of a molecule \n\nin the vapour phase is governed by its intrinsic affinity for either a polymer segment (kp) or \n\nan already sorbed solvent molecule (ks) (Figure 39). \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 39 \u2013 Basic sorption mechanism according to the ENSIC model. Insertion of a solvent molecule (? ) in \n\nthe polymer (?) / solvent matrix is governed by the two elementary insertion probabilities ks and kp.\n78\n\n \n\n \n\nNeither the DMSM nor the ENSIC models enable the prediction of the isotherm \n\nshape given in Figure 38b), because both models are unable in mathematically modelling \n\nsigmoidal curves.  \n\nTo describe sigmoidal sorption isotherms, Feng, H.\n76\n\n reported the modelling of \n\nvapour sorption in glassy polymers using a new dual mode sorption model. Besides \n\ndescribing the two mechanisms previously referred, the new model can simultaneously \n\ndescribe sigmoidal isotherms which could only be addressed by Guggenheim-Anderson-de \n\nBoer (GAB) model.\n76\n\n The underlying sorption mechanism can be explained as a \n\ncontribution of two sorption phenomena, one of which occurs in the matrix region and the \n\nother in the microvoids (Figure 40). \n\n\n\n62 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 40 \u2013 Left picture: SEM image of the fracture surface of duralumin\n79\n\n; Right picture: scheme of the \n\nsurface of a glassy polymer.76 \n\n \n\nThe sorbate concentration in the polymer described through this new model is also a \n\nsum of both mechanisms given by equation (9):  \n\n \n\n( )\n( ) pkA\n\npkA\nC\n\npk\n\npk\nCc\n\npP ???+\n?\n\n+\n?\n\n=\n11\n\n1\n\n1\n\n''\n\n'\n\n'\n\n                                                                                                   (9) \n\n \n\nThe new dual mode sorption has three parameters, pC , \n'\n\nk  and \n'\n\nA , as many as the \n\nconventional dual mode sorption. As shown in the Figure 41, the sorption occurs in two \n\nmodes or distinct places of the film: i) in the matrix region of the glassy polymers, given \n\nby the first term in equation (9) described by a downward curve similar to that of sorption \n\nin rubbery polymers; ii) in the microvoids, give by the second term in equation (9), \n\ndescribed by an upward curve.  \n\n \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 41 \u2013 Schematic representation of the new DMS model.\n76\n\n \n\n \n\nThe total amount of vapour molecules in the glassy polymers is equal to the sum of the two \n\ndifferent sorption modes.\n76\n\n In both modes, pC  is the weight value of the sorption capacity \n\nof the polymer to the sorbate, gas or vapour and it mainly depends on the structure and \n\nphysical state of the polymer and on the volume of the sorbate; \n'\n\nk is the difference between \n\nthe interaction of vapour molecules among themselves and the interactions between the \n\nvapour molecules and the polymer molecule segment; large \n'\n\nk  values indicate strong \n\ninteractions between the sorbate and the polymer; \n'\n\nA  is a measure of interactions between \n\nthe sorbate molecule and the microvoid. ( )kA ?? 1'  is a measure of the affinity between the \nvapour and the microvoid of the polymer. \n\nIndeed, equation (8)  is a special case of equation (9) when k\u2019<<1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Overview \n \n\nIn contrast to glass or metal packaging materials, packages made with plastic are \n\npermeable at different degrees to small molecules like gases, water vapor, and organic \n\nvapor and to other low molecular weight compounds like aromas, flavor, and additives \n\npresent into food. As a consequence of the barrier properties of the material, the transfer of \n\nthis molecules ranges from high to low.\n80\n\n Transport of gases, vapors and liquids through \n\npolymers is an important in some cases, controlling factor in several application such as \n\n\n\n64 \n\n \n\nprotective coatings, membrane separation processes and packaging of foods and \n\nbeverages.\n81\n\n It is important to know if there is interaction between food and packaging and \n\nconsequently to well understand the factors that can influence the transport mechanism \n\nthrough the material. The knowledge of the sorption/diffusion/permeation behaviors of \n\nthese molecules through the polymer film has become more and more important in recent \n\nyears, especially for polymers used in the food packaging field where contamination from \n\nexternal environment has to be avoided.\n80\n\n For the food industry a precise knowledge of O2 \n\nand CO2 sorption properties by the packaging is particularly important for product quality \n\nfor the development of plastics and coatings for bottles. PLA films impregnated with \n\nantioxidants have been recently studied\n52\u201355,63,82,83\n\n \n\nThe effect of the antioxidants in the gas barrier properties of PLA, were not well \n\ninvestigated before, as well as the transport mechanisms. So, in this chapter we will present \n\nthe sorption results of oxygen and carbon dioxide in PLA films enriched with ?-\n\ntocopherol, BHT and TBHQ. Not less important than to establish the mechanisms and \n\nlaws, relating solubility and transport in polymer membranes, of small molecules, is to \n\nstudy the influence of the size and shape of penetrant molecule in the sorption. While \n\nsmaller permeants will have a greater diffusion coefficient, the polymer will be less \n\nplasticized, whereas the lower diffusion coefficient of the larger permeants will be \n\ncompensated for the higher degree of sorption.\n81\n\n In the second part of this chapter, we will \n\npresent the sorption results of flavors in PLA films with different thermal treatments, an \n\narea were few data are available. The main objective was to study the effect of the flavor \n\nsize on sorption. Finally, we come back at the study of the solubility of ethylene in PLA \n\nfilms. Oliveira et al\n73\n\n reported the sorption of ethylene, in PLA films, regarding the \n\nethylene as a gas can be released into the package from fruits, vegetables and flowers, \n\nwhich, if were sensitive to ethylene,  when exposed to it, can ripen or mature quicker. \n\nDespite the nonpolar nature of the ethylene, we found that there is moderate interaction \n\nwith PLA. At the time, has being developed membranes with group ester which had \n\nperformance characteristics suitable for the separation of ethane/ethylene. We explore a \n\nlittle a new area that could use PLA membranes, where their poor properties barrier and \n\ntheir lack of flexibility could be useful. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\n3.4. Experimental \n \n\n3.4.1. Materials \n \n\nOxygen with 99.995 % and carbon dioxide with 99.999% were from Air Liquid. \n\nEthyl Acetate with 99.8% and butyl Acetate with 99.5 % of purity were purchased from \n\nAldrich and were used with no further purification. Ethane with 99.99% and Ethylene with \n\n99.5 % of purity were purchased from Aldrich. Solvent and gases were used with no \n\nfurther purification. PLA and antioxidants were previously described. \n\nQuartz crystals of 9 MHz base frequency, with silver or gold electrodes were \n\nsupplied by Euroquartz, Ltd. \n\n \n\n3.4.2. Quartz crystal coating \n \n\nThe sorption of oxygen and carbon dioxide in PLA and PLA enriched with ?-\n\ntocopherol, BHT and TBHQ films was measured using the QCM technique. Among the \n\nmethods used to prepare thin film samples for the QCM, the drop coating method proved \n\nto be successful in our previous studies,\n74\n\n was used. The QCM apparatus used in this work \n\nto measure gas solubility in PLA films has been thoroughly described by Oliveira.\n84\n\n In this \n\napparatus, the two 9 MHz quartz crystals used, with active area of 0.25 cm\n2\n were carefully \n\ncleaned with dichloromethane until the base frequency became constant (\u00b1 2 Hz). The \n\nmeasuring crystal was then coated with a thin polymer film, which was prepared by \n\ndropping a diluted solution on both sides of the quartz crystal electrode surface. The \n\nfrequency change to the polymer layer after thermal treatment at 190 \u00baC during 10 minutes \n\nfollowed by fast cooling in a freezer (15 min) was 99.391 Hz for PLA; 70.404 Hz for PLA \n\nwith 2.2 % ?-tocopherol; 105.907 Hz for PLA with 4.4 % ?-tocopherol; 83.313 Hz for \n\nPLA with 4.4 % TBHQ and 66.836 HZ for PLA with 4.4 % BHT. SEM images show that \n\nthe thermal treatment is very important to improve the morphological structure. For \n\nexample, dropping in a quartz crystal a solution with about 6 wt% of ?-tocopherol in PLA, \n\nand carried out the thermal treatment for one of them,  and the other was analyzed without \n\nany treatment, the results are shown in Figure 42. Thin films formed from the melted do \n\n\n\n66 \n\n \n\nnot have pores and are homogeneous. AFM images of a thin film of neat PLA is shown in \n\nFigure 43.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 42 \u2013 SEM images of thin films trapped on quartz crystal. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 43- AFM topography of neat PLA thin films with and without thermal treatment. \n\n \n\nOnce again, it is clearly the existence of pores in membranes without thermal treatment.  \n\nAFM images of melted thin films with 2 wt% and 4 wt% of ?-tocopherol in PLA, revealed \n\na roughness structure increase with the antioxidant amount present in the film. Large voids \n\nare present for PLA content 4 wt% of tocopherol.

Mass measurements using QCM \n \n\nTwo AT-cut Quartz crystals were use to perform the sorption measurements with a \n\nQCM apparatus: the measuring crystal coated with a thin layer of the polymer under study \n\nand the reference crystal, uncoated crystal, connected to an oscillator have been placed \n\ninside a solubility cell, which is placed inside a thermostatic water bath. The sorption \n\nmeasurements start by evacuating the apparatus until the frequency of both crystals are \n\nconstant at a desired temperature. The gas or flavor, previously thermostatized is admitted \n\ninto the solubility cell, promoting a change in the frequency of both crystals. The \n\nfrequency change is monitored as a function of time until sorption equilibrium has been \n\nachieved, i.e. until a stable frequency is reached. Several pressures of the gas up to 1 bar \n\nhave been studied and in the case of aromas, vapour pressures up to 10 % of saturated \n\nvapour pressure have been studied, using a heated Ceravac Transmiter, CTR 91 model, \n\nwhich have a measurement uncertainty of 0.2 % of reading \u00b1 temperature effect (0.01 of \n\nreading at span level and 0.005 of full scale at zero level). \n\nIf the polymer film is uniformly spread and vibrates synchronously with the quartz \n\ncrystal, the frequency of the wave is a function of the coated mass, according to the \n\nequation (2). When gas, or solvent, is injected into the system, the frequencies of both \n\ncrystals change. This frequency change is a sum of three independent terms: hydrostatic, \n\nimpedance and sorption. The first two terms are measured together using the reference \n\ncrystal. For each temperature and pressure, the frequencies of the coated and uncoated \n\ncrystal were experimentally measured and their difference is proportional to the mass of \n\nthe coating, polymer and gas, sorbed in it. Thus, the solubility of the gas in polymer, C, \n\nwas calculated according to the following equation: \n\n \n\ngasc\n\nmpols\n\nMF\n\nVF\nC\n\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n                                                                                                                                         (10) \n\n \n\nwhere ?pol. is the polymer density, ?FC represents the total mass of polymer coated on the \n\nquartz crystal and is determined by the difference in the oscillation frequency measured \n\nbefore coating and after the thermal treatment of the crystal with the coating. ?FS is \n\ncalculated from the frequency change due to gas sorption between the reference crystal \n\n\n\n69 \n\n \n\n(uncoated) and the measuring crystal coated with polymer. M is the gas molecular weight \n\nand Vm is the gas molar volume at STP conditions (22414 cm\n3\nmol\n\n-1\n). This equation \n\nassumes that the gas obeys ideal gas behavior and that the volume of the film remains \n\nconstant.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5. Oxygen and Carbon dioxide Sorption in antioxidants \n\nPoly(lactic acid) films \n\n \n\nAs mentioned before, the PLA has been intensively researched in an attempt to \n\nimprove its barrier and mechanical properties which prevent its use in the food packaging \n\nindustry and in the field of hygiene. In the last 5 years, the studies have been based on \n\ndemand for non-toxic compounds which can be blended with PLA and its effect on thermal \n\nand mechanical properties of the final blended package. In Table 8 can be found a few \n\nstudies were natural and synthetic antioxidants were impregnated in polymers used in food \n\npackaging and was adapted from Ref. 55 . As happened with others polymers also in PLA \n\nthe main objective of the most studies were rates, effects, and mechanism of antioxidants\u2019 \n\nrelease.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n\n \n\nTable 8 \u2013 Impregnation of antioxidants in polymers.  \n\nObject Antioxidant(s) Polymer year Reference \n\nMigration to food simulants BHT HDPE 1982 Till, et al\n85\n\n \n\nMigration to food simulants BHT PS 1987 Schwope et al\n86\n\n \n\nMobility in polymer in contact with fatty \n\nfood simulants \n?-Tocopherol, BHT LDPE 1998 Wessling, et al46 \n\nRetention in polymer in contact with \nfoodstuffs and food-simulating liquids \n\n?-Tocopherol LDPE, PP 1999 Wessling, et al28 \n\nInfluence of antioxidant on the \npolymer properties \n\n?-Tocopherol LDPE 2000 Wessling, et al29 \n\nStability of antioxidant in packaging film \n\nused for oatmeal \n?-Tocopherol, BHT LDPE 2001 Wessling, et al27 \n\nMigration of phenolic antioxidants from \n\nbranch and linear polymer \n\nSantonox, Irganox 1081, \n\nLow inox 22M46 \nPE 2006 Lundb\u00e4ck, et al\n\n87\n \n\nAntioxidant migration study of some \n\npolymers \n\nBHA, BHT, AO 2246, \nEthanox 330, Irganox \n\n1010, Irganox 1076 \n\nLDPE, HDPE, PP, \n\nPVC, PET \n2007 Dopico-Garcia et al\n\n47\n \n\nAntioxidant migration into food \n\nsimulants \nIrgafos 168, Irganox 1076 LLDPE 2007 Jeon et al\n\n88\n \n\nRelease of antioxidants to dry milk \n\nproducts and food simulants liquids \n?-Tocopherol, BHA, BHT PLGA 2007 Van Aardt et al89 \n\nRelease of antioxidant to asadero \ncheese and its effect on oxidation \n\nand odor stability \n\nBHT LDPE 2008 Soto-Cant\u00fa et al\n90\n\n \n\nImproving antioxidant release by \n\nsmart blending \n?, ?, and ? -Tocopherol \n\nLLDPE:HDPE \n\nLLDPE:PP  \n\nLLDPE: PS \n\n2008 Schaich et al\n91\n\n \n\nMigration to food stimulants (olive oil \n\nand waer) \ncarvacrol HDPE 2009 Peltzer et al\n\n92\n \n\nRelease of antioxidant from polymer film \n\nto whole milk powder \n?-Tocopherol, BHA, BHT \n\nHDPE-EVA-LDPE \n\n(co-extruded) \n2009 Granda-Restrepo et al\n\n48\n \n\nRelease of antioxidant from polymer film \n\nto distilled water \nl-Ascorbic acid, l-tyrosine CA 2010 Gemili, et al\n\n93\n \n\nInfluence of antioxidant on the polymer \n\nproperties \n\n?-tocopherol-BHT-\n\npolyethylene glycol \nPLA 2010 Byun et al\n\n52\n \n\nInfluence of antioxidant on the polymer \n\nproperties \n\n?-tocopherol and \n\nResveratrol \nPLA 2011 Hwang et al\n\n56\n \n\nRelease of antioxidant from polymer to \n\nethanol and soybean oil \n?-tocopherol PLA 2011 Manzanarez-L\u00f3pez et al53 \n\nRelease of antioxidant from polymer to \n\nwater, ethanol and coconut oil \n???

Sorption Results \n \n\n \n\n  The oxygen and carbon dioxide sorption in PLA and enriched PLA films with ?-\n\ntocopherol, were measured using the QCM. The sorption results obtained and their relative \n\nstandard deviation are presented in Table 9 for oxygen and in Table 10 for carbon dioxide.  \n\nAn example of the equilibrium sorption isotherms behaviour at 283 K is depicted in \n\nFigure 46. For both gases the sorption increases over the entire pressure range for all three \n\nfilms. The CO2 sorption in the three films exhibits the dual mode sorption nature as \n\ntypically observed for glassy polymers. The O2 sorption follows a predominant Henry \n\nbehaviour for the PLA, while the ?-tocopherol enriched films present a convex behaviour \n\ntowards the pressure axis, which is generally found for vapour sorption in polymers. \n52-54\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n\n \n\nTable 9 -

Surprisingly, the k\u00b4 parameter has very similar values for the two \n\ngases, leading to the conclusion that the magnitude of the interaction polymer-sorbate is \n\nsimilar in both cases. Nevertheless, the convex behaviour of the oxygen isotherms \n\nindicates that there is a strong specific interaction between the molecules and the glassy \n\nPLA, fact that does not happen for CO2.  \n\nAnother form to evaluate the underlying sorption mechanism is through the use the \n\ninfinite-dilution sorption, S0, expressed by  \n\n \n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n?

In Figure 47 the weight of Langmuir capacity, SH0 = Cp(A\u2019-1)k\u2019, \n\non total solubility for O2 and CO2 is reported. The most important conclusion is that the \n\nsorption mechanism of both gases in PLA is not affected by the presence of ?-tocopherol: \n\nthe sorption of CO2 occurs essentially in microvoids while the O2 solubilizes mostly in the \n\npolymer matrix. For CO2 the Langmuir capacity is roughly the same (around 80 %) for the \n\nthree films in the studied temperature interval.

The difference in \n\n\n\n78 \n\n \n\nmagnitude of CpK\u2019 between the two studied gases reflects the CO2 higher polarity and \n\ncondensability relatively to O2.

As shown previously in Figure 47, \n\nthe presence of ?-tocopherol in PLA films only influences the O2 solubility which displays \n\nan increasing sorption with the ?-tocopherol content. The CO2 solubility in PLA and PLA \n\nenriched films with 4.4 % of ?-tocopherol is roughly the same, while the CO2 solubility in \n\nenriched films with 2.2 % of ?-tocopherol is always lower. Since the sorption of CO2 takes \n\nplace predominantly in the microvoids, the ?-tocopherol content seems to somehow affect \n\ntheir size and distribution in 2.2 % (w/w) enriched PLA film.  \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\nFinally, the enthalpy change due the sorption of the gas was analyzed. Figure 49 shows \n\nthe sorption behaviour with temperature at 1 bar for both CO2 and O2. The enthalpy of \n\nsorption, ?HS, for both gases in PLA and enriched PLA films was obtained using the van\u2019t \n\nHoff relationship. The error bars are the 95 % confidence interval of the mean obtained \n\nfrom at least three independent values of solubility. The t student was obtained to (n-1) \n\ndegrees of freedom.\n95\n\n The sorption process is exothermic for both gases. The ?HS values \n\nobtained for CO2 in PLA and PLA enriched films with 2.2 % and 4.4 % ?-tocopherol are \n\nalmost constant -24.1 (\u00b10.1) kJ/mol, -23.2 (\u00b10.1) kJ/mol and -21.9 (\u00b10.2) kJ/mol \n\nrespectively, indicating again that the presence of ?-tocopherol does not affect the \n\nenergetics of CO2 sorption. Nevertheless, the ?HS values obtained for O2 in PLA enriched \n\nfilms with 0 %, 2.2 % and 4.4 % ?-tocopherol are -15.1 (\u00b10.1) kJ/mol, -11.9 (\u00b10.1) kJ/mol \n\nand -6.6 (\u00b10.2) kJ/mol,\n \nrespectively, show that the sorption of oxygen is clearly affected by \n\nthe increasing concentration of ?-tocopherol, in agreement with the sorption results, \n\nrendering a less exothermic processes.  \n\n \n\n-3.0\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 3.5 3.6\n\n1x10\n3\n/T (K\n\n-1\n)\n\nln\n(S\n\n)\n\nCO2\n\nO2\n\n \n\nFigure 49 -  van\u2019t Hoff relationship for O2 and CO2 to PLA (?) and ?-tocopherol enriched PLA 2.2% (?) and 4.4 \n% (?). \n\n \n\nSorption of melted PLA enriched with BHT and TBHQ 4.4 wt% were also studied, and an \n\nexample of the equilibrium sorption isotherms of the oxygen behaviour, at 303 K, is shown \n\nin Figure 50.

Conclusions \n\n \n\n \nSorption results of oxygen and carbon dioxide in melted PLA with and without ?-\n\ntocopherol show that oxygen sorption increases with the ?-tocopherol content and the \n\nconvex shape of the isotherms indicates a strong interaction gas-polymer. The sorption \n\nmechanism for both gases remains unchanged with the addition of ?-tocopherol: the \n\nsorption of oxygen occurs essentially in polymer matrix, whereas the carbon dioxide \n\nsolubilises mostly in the microvoids. Enriched films with 4 wt% of TBHQ show a slight \n\nincrease in the solubility of oxygen, but the same concentration of BHT decreases to about \n\nhalf the solubility value obtained for neat PLA at 303 K. As expected, the oxygen \n\nsolubility of neat PLA and PLA/TBHQ films decrease with the temperature. An anomalous \n\nbehaviour occurs for enriched membranes with 4 wt% of ?-tocopherol and BHT, for which \n\nthe solubility increases at the temperature of 313 K. This behaviour may be due to the \n\nproximity of the Tg, and the chain of the polymer acquire some mobility that promote \n\nrearranges, improve the free volume and consequently lead to  oxygen solubility increase.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n82 \n\n \n\n3.6. Ethyl Acetate and Butyl Acetate sorption in Poly(lactic \n\nacid) films \n\n \n\n3.6.1. Introduction \n \n\n \n\nFood packaging in recent years has experienced rapid advances and continuous \n\ngrowth due to consumer demand for conveniently packaged products. This has promoted a \n\ntrend in packaging materials that has evolved from simple food wraps to sophisticated \n\ncontainers. Besides providing an adequate shelf life and product quality, it is desirable that \n\nthe packaging material also participates in the overall flavor management of the packaged \n\nfood, since flavor is an underlying factor in the consumer acceptability of all food \n\nproducts.\n96\n\n However, the sorption of food aromas, particularly by packaging materials, is \n\nusually perceived as a major factor contributing to the quality alteration of most foods \n\nduring storage.\n96\n\n This causes changes in both the intensity and characteristics of the food \n\nflavors owing to their sorption by the packaging material, a phenomenon commonly \n\nreferred to as \u201cscalping\u201d. Flavor scalping is a term used in the packaging industry to \n\ndescribe the loss of quality of a packaged item due to either its volatile flavors being \n\nabsorbed by the package or the food absorbing undesirable flavors from the packaging \n\nmaterial.\n96\n\n The sorption of food constituents, especially aroma compounds, by polymeric \n\npackaging materials has received considerable attention during the past decade, and is \n\ngenerally considered to be a problem within the food packaging industry.\n97\n\n  \n\nThere are innumerous publications about transport of small molecules as gases (O2, \n\nCO2) or water through flexible food packaging, including in PLA. However, the barrier \n\nproperties of PLA against aroma compounds have been the subject of only a few studies. \n\nAroma compounds are very important among the volatile molecules that can \n\ninteract with packaging materials, but these interactions are much more complex than the \n\ninteractions between packaging and gases or water molecules.\n34\n\n Several factors can \n\ninfluence the transfer of aroma compounds through food packaging as, the package itself, \n\nthe chemical structure of the aromatic compound, the environment and the food matrix.\n34\n\n \n\nFood packaging interactions, defined as an interplay between food, packaging, and the \n\nenvironment, can produce an adverse effect on the food and/or the package.\n96\n\n \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\nInteractions between the plastic package and the flavor constituents can cause \n\nadsorption and absorption of flavor volatiles by the packaging material, permeation of the \n\nflavor volatiles through the plastic material, food- and flavor-induced changes in the \n\nphysical properties of the plastic polymer, as well as interactions of low-molecular-weight \n\ncompounds in the plastic such as solvent and plastifiers with the food flavor or the food \n\nitself, thereby resulting in an overall imbalance in the flavor profile of the food.\n96\n\n Figure 52 \n\nshows the possible interactions between foodstuff, polymer film, and the environment and \n\ntheir adverse consequences.\n96\n\n Flavor losses that result from interaction with the polymer \n\npackage can be either losse occurring by permeation or migration through the package or \n\nthose from sorption by the container.\n96\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 52 \u2013 Possible interactions between foodstuff, polymer film, and the environment and their adverse \n\nconsequences.\n96\n\n \n\nAmong the parameters that may influence the mass transfer of aroma compounds, \n\nTg of the polymer film can affect in a more important way the sorption by polymer than \n\ncrystallinity. Indeed, flavor sorption in rubbery polymers (OPP or LDPE) can be several \n\nthousand times higher than in glassy polymers (PET, PC, PEN), even if the crystallinity \n\npercentage is the most important factor in rubbery polymers.\n98\n\n Nevertheless, among glassy \n\npolymers, flavor sorption is more important for the less crystalline polymer. In some cases, \n\nno effect of Tg could be seen on gas transfer. It is argued that perhaps the number of holes \n\ndoes not greatly change above Tg but mainly the size of the holes changes, i.e., the \n\n\n\n84 \n\n \n\namplitude of the segmental oscillations or rotations increases. If penetrant molecules are \n\nsmall enough, only minor changes would be displayed because the probability of a \n\npenetrant molecule encountering a hole would remain roughly the same. With larger \n\npenetrant molecules, the size becomes important and effect of the glass transition can be \n\nseen.\n34\n\n  \n\nThe state of aroma compounds (liquid or vapor), as well as this physicochemical \n\nproperties such as molecular weight, structure, hydrophobicity, and polarity, have an \n\nimportant effect on the affinity for the polymeric matrix (sorption) and also on the transfer \n\nkinetics (diffusion). For example, concerning the molecular weight of the aroma, its  \n\nsolubility increases with their boiling point of the a homologous series of ethyl esters (C2 \n\nto C6), whereas diffusivity decreases with molecular weight. The saturated vapor pressure \n\nof aroma compounds decreases with the increase in their boiling point, which is related to \n\nthe increase in their molecular weight, thus making their sorption easier in the polymer \n\nfilm.\n34\n\n However, it is also reported that sorption of n-alkanes, n-aldehydes, n-alcohols, and \n\naliphatic ethylesters (C4 to C12) in PE increases linearly up to ten carbon atoms.\n34\n\n For  \n\nheavier sorbates (C12), the solubility reaches a plateau. Concerning diffusion, as the \n\nmolecular weight or molar volume of the aroma molecules increases, the steric hindrance \n\nin the polymeric matrix increases and the need for free volume as well. Short-chain esters \n\n(C8 to C12) diffuse much faster through a PVC film than the longer-chain ones (C14 to C18) \n\nat 50\u00b0C.\n34\n\n Moreover, methyl esters diffuse faster than ethyl esters at the same conditions \n\nbecause the steric hindrance of the ethyl group is higher. Consequently, the depth of \n\npenetration of methyl esters into PVC decreases with their chain length.\n34\n\n Diffusion \n\ngenerally decreases linearly for aroma compounds up to about ten carbon atoms. For \n\nheavier molecules, diffusion behavior changes according to the chemical structure of the  \n\naroma compounds.\n34\n\n \n\nConcerning the chemical structure of the aroma compound molecules, linear \n\nmolecules sorb more easily in the polymeric matrix than cyclic molecules because their \n\nmolar volume is smaller. The effect of the size and structure of the aroma molecules is \n\nmore important for a polymeric matrix in the glassy state than in the rubbery state. Indeed, \n\nsorption of linear primary alcohol molecules (C2 to C4) in EVOH increases with sorbate \n\nmolar volume below polymer Tg (glassy state) and decreases above polymer Tg (rubbery \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\nstate). The effect is even more important when the experimental temperature is far from the \n\npolymer Tg.\n34\n\n \n\nThe sorption behavior of aroma compounds in a polymeric matrix depends on a \n\ngreat extent on the relative polarity and hydrophobicity of the polymer-aroma system. The \n\noctanol-water partition coefficient (P) is the parameter usually taken to evaluate \n\nhydrophobicity, and is defined as the partition coefficient of the aroma compound between \n\noctanol and water usually expressed on a log scale (logP). Hydrophilic molecules have \n\nnegative logP values (around ?1.5 for diacetyl), while hydrophobic molecules have \n\npositive logP values (around 2.8 for ethyl hexanoate). Polarity is the distribution of electric \n\ncharges in a molecule and is generally characterized by the dielectric constant (?, \n\nadimensional). The dielectric constant of ethyl hexanoate is about 4, whereas a value of  \n\naround 80 is obtained for water.\n34\n\n The chemical families of aroma compounds are usually \n\nclassified regarding their decreasing polarity: acids, alcohols, esters, ethers, aldehydes, \n\nketones, aromatic hydrocarbons, unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons, and saturated \n\naliphatic hydrocarbons.\n34\n\n Aroma compounds are sorbed more easily in a polymeric matrix \n\nif polarity or dielectric constant of both the compound and the matrix are close.\n34\n\n It was \n\nobserved while studying absorption of hexanal, decanal, carvone and limonene in OPP and \n\nPET after 14 days contact in solution at 40 \u00b0C, the more polar aroma molecules (aldehydes \n\nand carvone) are more sorbed into PET (moderately polar polymer) than in OPP (apolar \n\npolymer).\n34\n\n On the other hand, limonene, a more apolar and hydrophobic aroma compound \n\nis more easily sorbed in OPP than in PET. When the difference of dielectric constant \n\nbetween a polymer and an aroma compound decreases, vapor sorption of the aroma \n\ncompound into the polymer increases. Limonene sorption (? = 2.30) into polyethylene (? = \n\n2.26) is thus higher than hexanol sorption (? = 13.30).\n34\n\n Table 13 shows the properties of \n\nPLA and others polymers commonly used for food packaging.\n99\n\n Polymers such as PET,  \n\nPC, and PLA have a Tg above ambient temperature (67 \u00baC, 149 \u00baC and 60 \u00baC, \n\nrespectively).\n96\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nTable 13 \u2013 Properties of PLA and other common plastics used in packaging industry.\n99\n\n \n\nPolymer \nGlass transition \n\ntemperature, Tg(\u00baC) \n\nMelting \n\npoint \n\n(\u00baC) \n\nTensile \n\nelongation, \n\nEL, (%) \n\nTensile \n\nstrength, \n\nTS, (MPa) \n\nDielectric \n\ndissipation \n\nfactor tan? \n\n(%) \n\nDielectric \n\nconstant, ? \n\nResistivity, \n\n?

Ethyl acetate is a natural compound and is environmentally safe and acceptable \n\nfor food applications, such as booster and enhancer for fruit aroma. Ethyl acetate is the \n\nmost hydrophilic aroma compound in the homologous series of the ethyl esters, and it was \n\nchosen here in order to test the performance of PLA in a rather unfavourable case. Butyl \n\nacetate is used in food industry as a component in synthetic flavours and also as a diluents \n\nfor dyes in inks for marking vegetables and fruits. Butyl acetate is found in many types of \n\nfruits, where along with other chemicals it imparts characteristic flavors and has a sweet \n\nsmell of banana or apple. It is used as a synthetic fruit flavoring candy, ice cream, cheeses, \n\nand baked goods. This compounds was chosen to evaluate the effect of incrementing the \n\nethyl acetate molecule by two carbon atoms. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 53 \u2013 Chemical structures of the flavours used in this work. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nAuras et al \n102\n\n showed that PLA has a very good barrier to d-limonene, a \n\nhydrophobic aroma compound found in orange juice. However, the sorption of ethyl \n\nacetate in PLA is approximately twice than in PET, PP and LDPE.  \n\n \n\n \n\n3.6.2. Sorption Results and Discussion \n \n\n \n\nThe flavour sorption was carried out in quartz crystals coated with the neat PLA \n\nfilm which were submitted to two distinct thermal treatments: the melting and the \n\nannealing treatment. The first, consists in heating the coated crystal from ambient \n\ntemperature up to 523 K, at 2 K/min, and cool it down to ambient temperature at 10 K/min. \n\nIn the annealing treatment, the crystal is introduced into an oven at 336 K, slightly above \n\nthe glassy transition temperature, for two days, cooled to room temperature for one day and \n\nintroduced again into the oven at 336 K for one day more. The total mass of polymer \n\ncoated on the quartz crystal is determined by difference in the oscillation frequency \n\nmeasured before coating and after the thermal treatment.  \n\nFigure 54 shows the frequency change, ?F, when both crystals, uncoated and \n\ncoated with melted PLA, were subject at an ethyl acetate vapour pressure at 283 K, 293 K \n\nand 403 K.

As mentioned before, the new DMS model for vapour sorption in \n\nglassy polymers assumes that two types of sorption contribute to the penetrant \n\nconcentration in glassy polymers: one taking place in the matrix region of the glassy \n\npolymer responsible for the downward curve similar to that observed for rubbery \n\npolymers; the other occurring in the microvoids responsible for an upward curve. \n\n \n\nTable 14 \u2013 Estimated values of the parameters of the new DMS and CDMS models for ethyl acetate \n\nvapour sorption in PLA  subjected to the two different temperature protocols over the studied range of \n\ntemperatures.  \n\nMelted PLA 98:2 \n\n5ew DMS model CDMS model \n\nTemperature (K) k\u2019 A\u2019 Cp (volume fraction) C\u2019H.b KD \n\n293 0.784 2.036 18.692 1.06\u00d710\n-3\n\n 31.4 \n\n303 0.998 1.00 38.799 1.66\u00d710\n-5 \n\n46.8 \n\n313 0.998 1.00 50.759 1.89\u00d710\n-3\n\n 59.6 \n\n      \n\nannealed PLA 98:2 \n\n303 0.998 1.00 15.311 3.48\u00d710\n-5\n\n 0.034 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 15 - \u2013 Comparison of the fitting efficiencies of the two models for ethyl acetate vapour sorption \n\nin PLA. \n\nMelted PLA 98:2 \n\n5ew DMS model CDMS model \n\nTemperature \n\n(K) \nSSE R\n\n2\n SSE R\n\n2\n \n\n293 0.12 0.9816 0.19 0.9564 \n\n303 0.40 0.9969 1.49 0.8861 \n\n313 1.58 0.9055 3.38 0.8493 \n\nannealed PLA 98:2 \n\n303 0.62 0.7269 29.7 0.7612 \n\n \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 56 and Figure 57 show the behaviour of pC , as well the k\u2019 and A\u2019 obtained for the \n\nsorption of ethyl acetate in PLA. \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n290 295 300 305 310 315\n\nA\n' a\n\nn\nd\n\n k\n' \n\nTemperature (K)\n\nK' melted PLA98:02\n\nK' annealed PLA98:02\n\nA' melted PLA98:02\n\nA' annealed PLA 98:02\n\n \n\nFigure 56 - A\u2019 and k\u2019 fitting parameters of the new DMS model as a function of temperature. \n\n \n\nThe pC  is the weighted mean value of the sorption capacity of the polymer to the \n\nvapour and it mainly depends on the structure and the state of the polymer. We can observe \n\nthat this factor increases sharply with temperature. Therefore, the melted PLA sorption \n\ncapacity for ethyl acetate increases with temperature. Along with this behaviour for pC , \n\nthe decrease of A' with temperature, from values greater than 1 at 293 K to approximately \n\n1 at 303 K, can be observed. Meanwhile, k' slightly increases in the temperature interval \n\nfrom 293 to 303 K, and remains constant at higher temperatures. At 303 K, the pC  value \n\nobtained for the  annealed PLA is lower than that of melted PLA. Interestingly, k\u2019 and A\u2019 \n\nare close to 1 for both films from 303 K onwards.  \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n293 303 313\n\nC\nP\n\n (\nc\nm\n\n3\n/c\n\nm\n3\n\np\no\n\nl)\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nmelted PLA98:02\n\nannealed PLA98:02\n\n \n\nFigure 57 \u2013 pC  fitting parameter of the new DMS model as a function of temperature. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe k\u2019 parameter is related to the interactions between the vapour molecules and the \n\npolymer segment. A large k\u2019 indicates stronger interaction between the vapour and \n\npolymer, i.e., a large amount of sorbed vapour molecules in the polymer. The results \n\nobtained in this work show that ethyl acetate sorbes strongly in the PLA, regardless of the \n\nstate of the polymer, melted or annealed. Moreover, the interactions established are not \n\ntemperature dependent, since only a slight deviation from linearity is observed for this \n\nparameter in the studied temperature range. Since A\u2019 is a measure of the interaction of the \n\nvapor molecule and the microvoids, it can be concluded that only at 293 K there is affinity \n\nbetween the vapor and the microvoids of the polymer. At higher temperatures A\u2019 is equal \n\nto the unity, indicating that the polymer should be in its rubbery state. Since the Tg of \n\nmelted PLA is 326 K, it should be in its glassy state at 293 K, 303 K and 313 K. Indeed, \n\nthe melted PLA seems to be in the rubbery state at 303 K and 313 K, due to the shape of \n\nthe sorption isotherms. This rubbery state is due to sorbed ethyl acetate, which acts as an \n\neffective PLA plasticizer, thus depressing the Tg of the polymer. Colomines et al \n9\n also \n\nreported that the sorption of ethyl acetate in PLA films can decrease the glass transition \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\ntemperature well below room temperature, to approximately 273 K. Due to the difficulties \n\nin controlling all the variables of the sorption apparatus, it was not possible to measure the \n\nsorption at 293 K and 313 K for annealed PLA. However, the study carried out at 303 K \n\nshows that this film is already in the rubbery state, as in the case of the melted PLA. For \n\nthe same temperature, pC  is higher in the melted than annealed PLA, and the A\u2019 values \n\nindicate that both polymers are in rubbery state. Then, why this difference? Initially, the \n\nmelted PLA film has 10 % crystallinity, whereas the annealed PLA film has 20%. If \n\nmicrovoids are changed during/after of the sorption of ethyl acetate, the sorption capacity \n\nof the polymer films is altered. Indeed, solvent-induced phenomenon can increase the \n\nsample dimensions after the sorption of solvent due to swelling of the polymer, causing the \n\nrelease of internal stress bringing about more mobility of the polymer chains and enabling \n\ncrystallization at low temperature.\n9\n The chains of the melted polymer might have an \n\nadditional facility to accommodate ethyl acetate molecules than annealed PLA. Another \n\npossible scenario is that the solvent-induced phenomenon can generate the appearance of \n\ncrystallites in higher percentage for annealed PLA than melted PLA. This solvent induced \n\ncrystallites has been described for the semi-crystalline polyester PET.\n9\n Unfortunately it \n\nwas not possible to measure the crystallinity before and after the film have been exposed to \n\nethyl acetate, however, SEM images (Figure 58) show that there was breakage film after \n\nexposure to this flavor. Both these aspects can explain the higher capacity of the melted \n\nPLA film to sorb acetate molecules, as shown in Figure 59. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 58 - SEM images of the surfaces of PLA films before and after exposure at ethyl acetate.  \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\n \n\n  Since the size of the vapor molecule also has some influence on the sorption \n\ncapacity of the polymer, and given the fact that smaller molecules have more sites \n\navailable to sorb than larger molecules, it is expect that the capacity of sorption of butyl \n\nacetate is smaller than for the ethyl acetate. Figure 60 shows that the solubility of butyl \n\nacetate is about 20 times smaller than that of ethyl acetate in melted PLA, and 5 times \n\nsmaller than that of ethyl acetate in annealed PLA. Although the dielectric constant of the \n\nbutyl acetate is slightly lower than of ethyl acetate, the large size of butyl acetate hinders \n\nits access to small sorption sites, which are still available for the ethyl acetate molecules.  \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n293 303 313\n\nS\n\u00d7\n\n1\n0\n\n3\n(k\n\ng\n.m\n\n-3\n.P\n\na\n-1\n\n)\n\nT (K)\n\nmelted PLA 98:02\n\nannealed PLA 98:02\n\nAuras et al\n\n \n\nFigure 59 \u2013 Ethyl acetate solubility in melted and annealed PLA 98:2 over a range of temperatures (this \n\nwork) and PLA 98:2 (Auras et al).\n102\n\n \n\n \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n303\n\nS\n\u00d7\n1\n\n0\n3\n\n(k\ng\n.m\n\n-3\n.P\n\na\n-1\n\n)\n\nT (K)\n\nEthyl Acetate\n\nButyl Acetate\n\n \n \n\nFigure 60 \u2013 Solubility data of ethyl acetate and butyl acetate in melted PLA 98:2, at 303 K.   \n\n \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nThe melted PLA has a higher sorption coefficient for ethyl acetate value and  \n\nannealed PLA has lower values than that obtained by Auras et al\n102\n\n.

Conclusions \n \n\n \n\nSorption isotherms of ethyl acetate and butyl acetate in PLA films, with different \n\nthermal treatments protocols, were measured using QCM. The sorption isotherms of ethyl \n\nacetate in PLA films submitted to different temperature protocols show that \n\nswelling/plasticizing effect of matrix of the polymer occurred caused by the flavour. The \n\ntransition of glassy state to rubbery state due to exposure to the flavour, was disclosed \n\nthrough the A\u2019 coefficient value obtained from the fitting of the data to the new DMS \n\nmodel. The obtained results show that the solubility of the ethyl acetate in PLA is similar \n\nto that of polymers commonly used in the food packaging. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.7. Ethane/ethylene sorption in Poly(lactic acid) films \n \n\nIn recent years, the separation of olefin and paraffin gases has received increased \n\nattention. The usual method using cryogenic distillation is very expensive and thus a large \n\ndemand for alternative energy saving processes that respect the enforced environmental \n\nregulations has been verified. Among a number of alternative processes, membrane \n\nseparation technologies would be the best option if it wasn\u2019t for their low selectivity in \n\nterms of olefins relatively to parent paraffins.\n103\n\n Separation using facilitated transport \n\nmembranes, which are composed of  a polar polymer containing oxygen atoms with \n\nphysically dissolved ion metals such as Cu\n+\n or Ag\n\n+\n, has been the subject of intensive \n\nresearch since high separation performances were obtained.\n104, 105, 106\n\n  Recently, Kim H. et \n\nal\n107\n\n  developed membranes based on zwitterionic compounds with an ester group that \n\npresented high performances for application in separation olefin-paraffin mixtures. \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\nHowever, this technique still has some problems to be overcome, being the most important \n\nthe poor chemical stability due to carrier poisoning.\n108\n\n The olefin/paraffin separation \n\nthrough the use of polymeric membranes without carriers has also been studied in the \n\nliterature. In particular, poly(imides) showed a higher permselectivity for \n\npropylene/propane when compared to other polymers.\n109\u2013111\n\n \n\nIn the present work, the solubility selectivity of PLA, a poly(ester) membrane, \n\ntowards ethane/ethylene is investigated. Polyesters are polar polymers with oxygen atoms \n\nand their applicability in gas separation has not yet been studied. Nevertheless, interesting \n\nresults of solubility of condensable gases, namely ethylene, carbon dioxide and water \n\nvapour in PLA films with various L:D ratios and thermal treatments were reported in \n\nearlier works.\n 13, 73,112 \n\nGas sorption in polymers depends not only on the condensability of \n\npermeant gas but also on the polymer-penetrant gas interactions. In the present case of the \n\nethane/ethylene separation, the carbon-carbon double bond in ethylene is responsible for \n\nthe higher density of negative charge in the region of the ? bond, susceptible to electron-\n\nseeking, and can interact favourably with the ester group of the polymer, that has \n\nhydrolytically labile aliphatic ester linkages in its backbone\n112,113\n\n, thus promoting an \n\nincrease in its solubility when compared to that of ethane. Despite its high condensability, \n\nthe weak interaction between ethane and PLA results in lower solubility relatively to \n\nethylene.  \n\nThe polymer crystallization is also another parameter that has to be taken into \n\naccount, since it determines the final properties of many technologically relevant systems \n\nbased on semicrystalline polymers. The change of solubility, diffusivity and permeability \n\ncoefficients with temperature and pressure can be explained in part by the \n\n\u201cimpermeability\u201d of crystalline region. The effect of thermal treatment in the gas solubility \n\nof PLA films is well documented\n73,112\n\n and has proved to be a valuable tool in tailoring \n\npolymer films to obtained specific values for sorption, diffusivity and permeability. If the \n\npresence of crystallites can reduce the available volume for penetrant sorption, they can \n\nalso increase the microcavities or Langmuir sites and thus the second mode of sorption \n\n(Langmuir type) can play a more important role than Henry\u2019s sites.\n114\n\n  \n\nThe improvement of permeability and permselectivity of new membranes for gas \n\nseparation has been object of study by many authors.\n103,115\u2013118\n\n The first step in this type of \n\nwork is to evaluate the solubility of the gas or gas mixture in the polymer film in order to \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\nevaluate the possible interactions between them. The second step would be to address the \n\ntransport properties that are necessary for this purpose. In this work we only explore the \n\nfirst aspect. The study of the influence of the structure of the polymer PLA film on the \n\nsorption and consequently on the sorption selectivity of ethane and ethylene was performed \n\nusing the QCM technique, which has already been successfully used for that purpose.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.7.1.

The lines represent, in both cases, the correlation with dual-mode sorption model. \n\n \n\nThe first conclusion that can be drawn from these Figures is that the solubility of \n\nethylene is always larger than the solubility of ethane, for the same experimental \n\n\n\n100 \n\n \n\nconditions. Unlike what is commonly observed the solubility of these gases does not \n\nfollow their condensability order (T\nc\n ethane = 305.3 K; T\n\nc\n ethylene = 282.5 K).\n\n119\n The \n\nhigher solubility of ethylene relatively to ethane can be explained by the strong interaction \n\nbetween this gas and the polymer. PLA is a poly (?-hydroxy acid) and, as all poly (?-\n\nesters) with hydrolytically labile aliphatic ester linkages in its backbone, can interact with \n\nthe weak hydrogen bond basicity of alkenes, such as ethylene. On the other hand, ethane \n\nhas no such capacity. For the studied systems, the polymer\u2013penetrant interaction plays a \n\nmore important role than the condensability of gas. Also as the temperature increases, the \n\ndifference in condensability between the two gases decreases and thus the solubility of \n\nethane and ethylene should become similar, which is not observed confirming that the \n\npolymer-penetrant interaction of ethylene is the driving force in the solubility of this gas in \n\nPLA. \n\nAnalyzing the sorption results in terms of the thermal treatments of the PLA films, \n\nthe ethylene sorption presents an opposite behavior to that observed for ethane. The \n\nsorption of ethylene in the annealed films (either PLA 80:20 or 98:2) is higher than in the \n\nmelted PLA 98:2 films. When the films are submitted to temperatures higher than the Tg, \n\nthe polymeric chain mobility is enhanced. The re-organization of linkages can promote a \n\ndifferent positioning of the hydroxyl groups to the outer side of the chain and thus the \n\ninteraction of theses linkages with the double bond of ethylene becomes more favorable. \n\nThe lower solubility of PLA 98:2 annealed relatively at PLA 80:20 annealed films should \n\nbe due the presence of crystalline domains that difficult the molecular orientation and \n\ninhibit the interaction. Note also that the annealing process was performed on films which \n\nalready contained many micro-crystallites, while in the melted PLA 98:2 film they are \n\nformed from the molten polymer. This means that the crystallites present in these two films \n\nare naturally different from each other and thus can influence in different ways the gas \n\nsolubility.   \n\n At lower temperatures the results show yet a larger difference in solubility between \n\nthe PLA 80:20 and PLA 98:2 for both thermal treatments. This difference decreases with \n\nincreasing temperature and at 313 K they are similar. This behavior can be explained by a \n\ndecrease of the condensability of gases with the temperature. Ethane has a same behavior \n\non overall range of temperature. The sorption is higher in PLA 98:2 annealed than in the \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\nother two films.

This behaviour shows that there is a strong correlation between the \n\ncrystallinity and the microcavities, meaning that the crystallites might act as virtual cross-\n\nlinkers enhancing the available free volume and thus the Langmuir sites.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 63 - Henry\u2019s law coefficient for ethane in annealed PLA 80:20 and 98:2 and in melted PLA 98:2 from \n283 K  to 313 K. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 64 - Langmuir concentration for ethane and affinity parameter between ethane and annealed PLA \n\n80:20 and 98:2 and in melted PLA 98:2 from 283 K  to 313 K. \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe DMSM correlates very well the sorption results obtained for both ethane and \n\nethylene in the three polymer films in the temperature range from 293 K to 313 K with \n\noverall average absolute deviation (AAD) smaller than 3% for ethane and 5% for ethylene. \n\nSemi-crystalline polymers have an important role at industrial level due to the fact \n\nthat their properties can be manipulated to desired values, through the promotion of \n\ncrystallites formation, as it can be seen in Figure 65. The change in the overall solubility \n\ncoefficient in PLA 98:2 with temperature and thermal treatment performed is shown in \n\nFigure 65. As the temperature increases, the solubility coefficient decreases for all the \n\nstudied systems. On the other hand, for the same temperature the solubility coefficient \n\nincreases with the increase of crystallinity in the film for both gases. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 65 - Temperature dependence of the solubility coefficients of ethane and ethylene for PLA 98:2. \n\n \n\nFinally, the solubility selectivity of ethylene over ethane was calculated for the \n\ndifferent PLA films is presented in Figure 66.  \n\n\n\n104 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 66 - Temperature dependence of the solubility selectivity of ethylene over ethane for the three \n\ndifferent PLA films. \n\nSurprisingly, three different behaviours are observed: for the annealed PLA 80:20 \n\nfilm the solubility selectivity decreases with temperature; for the melted PLA 98:2 film the \n\nsolubility selectivity remains constant and for the annealed PLA 98:2 film the solubility \n\nselectivity increases with the temperature. These differences can be explained by the \n\ndifferences in solubility dependence with the temperature. \n\nFrom the results presented so far it is obvious that the control of polymer structure \n\nis very important in the production of a PLA films with an adequate selectivity for the \n\nstudied gases The difference in the interactions between ethane and polymer film and \n\nethylene and the polymer film are due to a specific interaction of the latter with the \n\npolymer chains but this interaction is also due to the control of the polymer structure \n\nthrough the crystallinity, which results in different mechanisms of sorption. For the PLA \n\n80:20, where no crystallinity was observed, the solubility selectivity can be enhanced by \n\nlowering the working temperature. As for the other two semi crystalline films, it is \n\ninteresting to observe that while for the melted film (10% crystallinity) the temperature \n\ndoes not have any effect on the solubility selectivity, for the annealed film (20% \n\ncrystallinity) this parameter can be improved by increasing the temperature. Moreover, if \n\nthe working temperature of separation is higher than 310 K, better solubility selectivity is \n\nobtained if PLA 98:2 annealed films are used. Generally, among the membranes studied, \n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\nthe PLA 80:20 presents the best performance, followed by the melted PLA 98:2 and the \n\nannealed PLA 98:2.  \n\n \n\n3.8. Conclusions \n \n\nThe use of PLA membranes for light olefin/paraffin separation was here studied for \n\nthe first time. The QCM technique was successfully used to measure the solubility of C2H6 \n\nand C2H4 in PLA with 80:20 and 98:2 (L:D) content, within the temperature range from \n\n283 to 313 K and pressures up to 1 bar. The differences in sorption between ethane and \n\nethylene can be attributed to a specific interaction between ethylene and the polymer \n\nchains. A difference in sorption behaviour between membranes with different thermal \n\ntreatments was explained by the creation of extra free volume due to the presence of \n\ndifferent percentage of crystallites. The performance of these membranes decreases with \n\nthe increase of their crystallinity.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n106 \n\n \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.

Introduction \n \n\nGas transport through polymers is of fundamental importance as it impacts our lives \n\nin many different ways, from the tires on our cars and automobiles to the bags used in \n\npackaging food, to the membrane modules used in gas separation - the list goes on \n\nindefinitely.\n120\n\n  Therefore, understanding gas transport and its dependence on the \n\ncharacteristics of the polymer is undoubtedly a corner stone that enables us to control and \n\nimprove the properties of numerous products. In the field of polymer science, three \n\nparameters describe the gas transport through a given material; these parameters are gas \n\nsorption, diffusion, and permeability.\n120\n\n  \n\nThe first observation of the permeation phenomenon goes back to 1829 when \n\nGraham\n121\n\n noticed the inflation of a rubber structure in the presence of carbon dioxide.  \n\nPermeability is the transfer of small molecules called \u201cpermeants\u201d or \u201cpenetrants\u201d through \n\na membrane, and permeability also defines how easily the permeants transport through a \n\nmembrane is achieved.\n15\n\n Large permeability values are attributed to poor barrier \n\nmembranes, and small permeability values to good barrier membranes. Plastic materials \n\nprovide a broad range of permeabilities to small molecules such as gases, water vapour, \n\norganic vapours, and liquids, and thus can range from being \u201cexcellent\u201d to \u201cpoor\u201d \n\nbarriers.\n15\n\n The preservation of a food product packaged in a plastic film mainly depends on \n\nthe maintenance of its original quality by protecting it against external deteriorative \n\ninfluences.\n122\n\n If on the one hand the loss of water may lead to undesirable drying, \n\ndetrimental to both the texture of the product and is economically deleterious to the \n\nmanufacturer, on the other hand an increase in the water concentration to an increase on \n\nthe water activity (Aw) risking to approach the region of microbial spoilage above Aw = \n\n0.8. More harmful than moisture is oxygen for foods from plant or animal origin due lipid \n\noxidation reactions that can occur causing rancidity, especially when the package allows \n\nlight transmittance.\n122\n\n The other requirements for the preservation of the qualities \n\n(physical, chemical, sanitary, organoleptic) of the food are prevention of changes in taste, \n\ncolour and odour.\n122\n\n \n\nThe permeation through dense, non-porous polymers is usually described by a \u201csorption-\n\ndiffusion mechanism\u201d\n123\n\n and involves three steps: 1) sorption of the species at the \n\nmembrane surface; 2) diffusion of the sorbed compounds through the membrane; and 3) \n\n\n\n109 \n\n \n\ndesorption of the compounds on the other side of the membrane, at the downstream face of \n\nthe polymer. Steps 1 and 3 are very fast relative to step 2, therefore, diffusion through the \n\npolymer is rate-limiting step in mass transport across a membrane.\n124\n\n In other words, the \n\npermeation processes take place through a membrane that separates two fluid phases (gas, \n\nvapour, or liquid) containing low molecular weight species with differing chemical \n\npotential. The molecules at the side of higher chemical potential tend to diffuse through the \n\nmembrane and equilibrate the chemical potential on both sides. The permeation process in \n\ncontinuous polymeric materials is accomplished by molecular diffusion within the polymer \n\nmatrix.\n15,125\n\n Figure 67 shows a sketch of a diffusion process through a membrane.\n15\n\n \n\nDiffusion is a phenomenon controlled by temperature. Therefore, above the glass transition \n\ntemperature, Tg, of a polymer, the molecules (Phase I) are first sorbed into the polymer \n\nand then diffuse through the polymer by an activated process of random movement \n\ninduced by the Brownian motion of the polymer chains.\n15\n\n Below Tg, the permeant dwelled \n\nin a cavity of the polymer for a while and then performs a quick jump into an adjacent \n\ncavity.\n15\n\n The diffusing molecules move through the amorphous regions of a polymer \n\nwithin the free volume between the polymeric molecules.\n15\n\n Upon diffusion through the \n\nmembrane, the molecules are desorbed from the membrane to the low chemical potential \n\nside (Phase II).\n15\n\n Various factors affect the permeability, sorption and diffusion in PLA as \n\nshowed in Figure 68.  \n\n \n\nFigure 67 \u2013 Sketch of the diffusion process through a film.\n125\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n110 \n\n \n\nThe diffusion processes which occur in steady state take place at a constant rate, \n\nthat is, once the process starts the number of molecules crossing a given interface (the flux) \n\nis constant with time, i.e., the flux, J, of gas in a polymer matrix can be defined as the \n\nquantity of diffusing, Q, which crosses the membrane with area A, and thickness l during \n\nthe time t: \n\n \n\nAt\n\nQ\nJ =                                                                                                                                                            (15) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe Fick\u2019s First law describes the process, in which the flux through the membrane, J,  is \n\nproportional to the existing concentration gradient and may be expressed by the following \n\nequation: \n\n \n\n \n \n\nx\n\nC\nDJ\n\n?\n?\n\n?=                                                                                                                                                  (16) \n\n \n\nwhere D denotes the diffusion coefficient and C the concentration of  the species inside the \n\nmembrane, and x is the membrane spatial coordinate.\n126\n\n  The negative sign in this \n\nrelationship indicates that the particle flow occurs in a \u201cdown\u201d gradient direction, i.e. from \n\nregions of higher to regions of lower concentration. Diffusion processes for membrane-gas \n\npair under steady state follow the Fick\u2019s first law and the sorption isotherm is linear.\n127\n\n On \n\nthe other hand, if diffusion occurs under non-steady state, the rate of compositional change \n\nis proportional to the \u201crate of change\u201d of the concentration gradient rather than to the \n\nconcentration gradient itself: \n\n \n\nx\n\nJ\n\nt\n\nC\n\n?\n?\n\n?=\n?\n?\n\n \n                                                                                                                                                  (17) \n\n \n\nCombining the equation (16) and (17) and assuming that D is constant in the membrane \n\nleads to Fick\u2019s second law: \n\n \n\n2\n\n2\n\n \n0\n\n x\n\nC\nD\n\nt\n\nC\n\nx\n\nC\nD\n\nxt\n\nC\n\n?\n?\n\n=\n?\n?\n\n?=?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n                                                                                     (18) \n\n \n\n\n\n111 \n\n \n\nWhen a polymer membrane, of thickness l, is exposed to a gas and when the diffusion \n\ncoefficient is constant, the integration of equation (16) gives: \n\n \n\n??

When t tends towards the very long times, the steady state is \n\nreached (Figure 69), and the time-lag, tL, can be obtained graphically from the interception \n\nof the abscissa coordinate place at the initial permeate pressure with the linear \n\nextrapolation of the permeate pressure history at pseudo steady-state.\n126\n\n The time-lag \n\nparameter relates with the effective diffusion coefficient according with the following \n\nequation:  \n\n \n\nD\n\nl\nt\n\nL\n6\n\n2\n\n=                                                                                                                     (29) \n\n \n\nApplying a best-fit straight line to the observed values for the permeate pressure as a \n\nfunction of time after steady-state is established, one obtains a slope, m and an intercept, b, \n\nwhich allow to determine the permeability coefficient and the time-lag. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n114 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nQ\n\nTimetL\n\nsteady state\n\n \n\nFigure 69 \u2013 Typical permeation and time-lag curve. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn this work, two time-lag units were used to measure the permeability of carbon dioxide \n\nand oxygen in PLA membranes, being one of them assembled in the framework of this \n\nthesis and other was used in Laboratory for Process Engineering, Environment, \n\nBiotechnology and Energy (LEPAE) at Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto in \n\nthe research group headed by Professor Ad\u00e9lio Mendes and that served as traceability and \n\nvalidation unit for the new unit built at the University of Aveiro.

The \n\npermeability, diffusivity and solubility of carbon dioxide and oxygen in PLA with and \n\nwithout antioxidants were measured.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. Experimental \n \n\n4.2.1. Time-lag apparatus \n \n\nA diagram of the time-lag apparatus build is shown in Figure 70. It is composed of two \n\nstainless steel tanks, one of them with 5 dm\n3\n (feed) and the other with (34.2 \u00b1 0.2) cm\n\n3\n \n\n(permeate). Both reservoirs are connected to the permeation cell, which has 13.9 cm\n2\n of \n\neffective area. This cell is composed of a sintered disk to support the membrane and a \n\nviton O-ring to seal the cell. Two sensors record the pressure, one at feed tank (S-10 \n\nWIKA, 600 KPa, \u00b1 0.05 % FS, P1) and in the permeate tank there was a high precision \n\nabsolute pressure sensor (MKS e-Baratron, ref. 628 C, 13.33 KPa, 0.001 % FS, P2) for \n\nmeasuring pressure variations. The time-lag unit was placed inside a thermostatic cabinet \n\nwith a precision of \u00b1 0.05 K. A rotatory high vacuum pump (BOC Edwards, RV3) \n\nguaranteed vacuum conditions. The temperature was measured with a Pt-100 placed very \n\nclose to the time-lag cell and connected to a data acquisition switch unit (Agilent, model \n\n34970 with 6 \u00bd digit digital multimeter using Agilent BenchLink data logger software). \n\nThe vacuum was obtained with valves V2, V3, V4 and V5 that are manipulated from the \n\noutside of the cabinet in order to avoid temperature changes.  \n\n\n\n116 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 70 -Time-lag apparatus.

Materials \n \n\n4.2.2.1.  Membranes performance \n \n\nIn this work, many attempts to produce thin membranes using the casting method were \n\nmade. Initially we started by spreading a PLA solution on a flat surface and then \n\nsmoothing it with a knife and allowing it to evaporate. The membranes obtained were very \n\nthin and fragile and no measurements could be achieved with them since the gas instantly \n\npassed through them. SEM images of these membranes show that these were porous \n\nmembranes (Figure 71). \n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 71 \u2013 SEM image of the membrane obtained by scattering  method. \n\n \n\nThis method was further improved and extra care was taken especially with the \n\nevaporation rate of the solvent. The membranes with and without antioxidants were \n\npreviously described in chapter 2, and were there characterized. Before testing, the \n\nthickness of the films was measured using a digital micrometer (model MDC-25S, \n\nMitutoya Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Mean thickness was calculated from six measurements \n\ntaken at different locations in each sample. At least, three samples of each film type were \n\nmeasured.  \n\n \n\n4.3. Results \n \n\n4.3.1. Gas permeation properties \n \n\nThe barrier properties of PLA films are very important in the technological and \n\nfunctional aspects of packaging materials. In order to understand the effect of structurally \n\ndifferent antioxidants incorporation on the barrier properties of PLA films, single gas \n\npermeation measurements using CO2 and O2 were performed at three temperatures (284 K, \n\n293 K and 303 K) for all the PLA films. For 313 K, only PLA membranes were studied, \n\nbecause the membranes with ?-tocopherol and BHT, exhibit an abnormal behavior at this \n\ntemperature, perhaps because this temperature is close to Tg, and the chains can move and \n\nrearrange themselves in response to the stress imposed by the gas pressure. \n\n\n\n118 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3.2. Carbon dioxide permeation \n \n\nTypical pressure history data for CO2 permeation in PLA films in the temperature \n\ninterval between 284 K and 303 K are shown in Figure 72. As the temperature increases, \n\nthe time-lag becomes smaller, meaning that the diffusivity increases with temperature.  \n\nIn Table 18 are presented the results obtained by time-lag technique for PLA based \n\nfilms. Also, for neat PLA, comparison with data found in other works with PLA \n\nmembranes containing a percentage of L-lactid near the PLA used in this work was \n\nperformed. The results for neat PLA films towards CO2 at 303 K are in good agreement \n\nwith that reported by Auras et al. \n129\n\n and Bao et al.\n130\n\n  \n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n0 4000 8000 12000\n\nP\nr\ne\ns\ns\nu\n\nr\ne\n (\nP\n\na\n)\n\nTime (s)\n\n283 K\n\n293 K\n\n303 K\n\n \n\nFigure 72 - Typical pressure history for CO2 permeation in the neat PLA film at different temperatures. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n119 \n\n \n\nTable 18 \u2013 Experimental data obtained from time-lag technique for carbon dioxide in PLA films with \n\nand without antioxidants.

Many different membranes \n\nwere studied without observing a time-lag. However, the results could be obtained at \n\nhigher concentrations of ?-tocopherol and SEM images of the films are compared in \n\nFigure 76. The SEM image of the film enriched with 4 wt% of ?-tocopherol, revealed that \n\nthe size of the voids is smaller than in the film at 2 wt%, and that the film gained some \n\nhomogeneity despite having areas similar to an orange peel appearance. The increase of the \n\namount of ?-tocopherol seemed to improve the morphological properties, that continued to \n\nbe, nevertheless, still quite poor. \n\n \n\n\n\n122 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 76 \u2013 SEM images of fracture surfaces of PLA based films containing 2 and 5 wt% of ?-tocopherol. \n\n \n\nThe temperature dependence of CO2 permeation properties for neat PLA and \n\nantioxidants enriched films, in the temperature range of 284 K - 303 K, is presented in \n\nFigure 77 to Figure 79.

The O2 permeation and solubility in PLA at 303 K are 1.7 times and \n\n4 times higher those reported by Bao et al. \n130\n\n, respectively and the diffusivity is about 2.5 \n\ntimes lower.

The increased crystallinity of our films might have caused highly tortuous paths \n\nwithin the membrane and consequently a decrease of the diffusivity.  \n\nThe incorporation of only 2 wt.% of BHT and TBHQ into PLA films, on average, \n\ndecreases the O2 permeability by 40 % and 19 %, respectively, while the incorporation of 4 \n\nwt.% of ?-tocopherol into PLA films did not significantly affect the permeability towards \n\nO2 from 283 K to 293 K, but increase for 303 K (Figure 80).  \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n284 293 303\n\nP\n\u00d7\n1\n\n0\n1\n\n8\n(m\n\n3\n.m\n\n/m\n2\n.s\n\n.P\na\n)\n\nT (K)\n\nNeat PLA PLA/BHT-2wt% PLA/TBHQ-2wt% PLA/a-tocopherol-4wt%\n\n \n\nFigure 80 \u2013 Oxygen permeation of antioxidants  PLA films. \n\n \n\nThe decrease in the O2 permeability obtained for the PLA films with incorporated \n\nBHT and TBHQ can be attributed to their slow gas diffusion compared to the pure PLA \n\nfilm. A similarity in behaviour pattern between permeability and diffusivity is observed, \n\nand this result is consistent with the well known gas transport behaviour in dense polymer \n\nmembranes. Although gas molecules dissolve into the polymer and diffuse through it, the \n\ndifferences in the gas permeability mainly arise from the diffusion differences of each gas \n\ncomponent (Figure 81) in the polymer film since the solubilities tend to slightly increase or \n\nto be similar (Figure 82). Furthermore, SEM images revealed that films with 2 wt% of \n\nthese antioxidants (Figure 27) present a better integrity than PLA. If their structure is more \n\ncohesive, and the diffusion of both carbon dioxide and oxygen is lower than in neat PLA, \n\nthen these two antioxidants may be acting as fillers.   \n\n \n\n\n\n128 \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n284 293 303\n\nD\n\u00d7\n1\n\n0\n1\n2\n(m\n\n2\n/s\n\n)\n\nT (K)\n\nNeat PLA PLA/BHT-2wt% PLA/TBHQ-2wt% PLA/a-tocopherol-4wt%\n\n \n \n\nFigure 81 \u2013 Oxygen diffusivity of antioxidants enriched PLA based films. \n\n \n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n284 293 303\n\nS\n\u00d7\n1\n\n0\n6\n(m\n\n3\n(S\n\nT\nP\n\n)/\nm\n\n3\n)\n\nT (K)\n\nNeat PLA PLA/BHT-2wt% PLA/TBHQ-2wt% PLA/a-tocopherol-4wt%\n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 82 \u2013 Oxygen solubility of antioxidants PLA films. \n\n \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\n-50\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n282 292 303\n\ne\nff\n\ne\nc\nt \n\no\nn\n\n p\ne\nr\nm\n\ne\na\n\nb\nil\n\nit\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nT (K)\n\nPLA/BHT-2wt%\nPLA/TBHQ-2wt%\nPLA/a-tocopherol-4wt%\n\n \n\nFigure 83 \u2013 Effect of each antioxidant on  the O2 permeability of antioxidants enriched in PLA-based films \n\nwith the temperature. \n\n \n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n282 292 303\n\ne\nff\n\ne\nc\nt \n\no\nn\n\n d\nif\n\nfu\nsi\n\nv\nit\n\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nT (K)\n\nPLA/BHT-2wt%\nPLA/TBHQ-2wt%\nPLA/a-tocopherol-4wt%\n\n \n\nFigure 84 \u2013 Effect of each antioxidant on the O2 diffusivity of antioxidants enriched in PLA-based films with \n\nthe temperature. \n\n\n\n130 \n\n \n\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n282 292 303\n\ne\nff\n\ne\nc\nt \no\nn\n\n s\no\nlu\n\nb\nil\n\nit\ny\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nT (K)\n\nPLA/BHT-2wt%\nPLA/TBHQ-2wt%\nPLA/a-tocopherol-4wt%\n\n \n\nFigure 85 \u2013 Effect of each antioxidant on the O2 diffusivity of antioxidants enriched in PLA-based films with \n\nthe temperature. \n\n \n\nThe temperature dependence of O2 permeation properties for neat PLA and \n\nantioxidants enriched films, in the temperature range of 284-303 K is presented in Figure \n\n86 to Figure 88.

The \n\nincorporation of antioxidants into PLA films does not affect the activation energy for O2 \n\npermeability, but a less endothermic diffusivity than that observed for the neat PLA was \n\nfound for BHT and TBHQ. Also, the incorporation of 2 wt % of BHT or TBHQ into PLA \n\nfilms renders the oxygen solubility in PLA films a less exothermic process.  \n\nAs found by QCM technique, at higher temperatures, the oxygen solubility in ?-\n\ntocopherol enriched films increase. This behaviour is independent of the thermal treatment \n\nof the films, because in QCM the films were melted. Once more, the mobility of the \n\npolymeric chains must occur, and the increase of free volume promotes de solubility. \n\n \n\n4.4. Conclusions \n \n\nCarbon dioxide and oxygen are two of the main permeants studied in packaging \n\napplication, because they may transfer from internal or external environment through the \n\npolymer package wall, influencing the quality and shelf-life of the food. The introduction \n\nof new packaging material PLA based as well its end-use application depend of its barrier \n\n\n\n133 \n\n \n\nproperties. The incorporation of only 2 wt % of BHT and TBHQ decreases the carbon \n\ndioxide permeability in average 44 % and 30 % and decrease the oxygen permeability by \n\n40 % and 20 %, respectively. Although the barrier properties have been improved, the \n\nBHT or TBHQ-PLA based membranes have lower CO2 and O2 permeability coefficients \n\nthan PS and PP but higher than PET, the most used to make plastic bottles for carbonated \n\ndrinks due to good barrier to oxygen and carbon dioxide. Regarding to barrier properties of \n\nthe PLA (Figure 89 and Figure 90), it could replaces a wide variety of synthetic polymers \n\nused in packaging industry, if not were its brittleness failure and low tensile elongation. \n\n0,0 5,0 10,0 15,0 20,0\n\nPLA/BHT-2wt%\n\nPLA/TBHQ-2wt%\nPLA/a-tocopherol 4wt%\n\nPLA\n\nPET\nPVC unplasticized\n\nLDPE (0.965 g/cm3)\nHDPE\n\nPS\n\nPP\nLDPE (0.922 g/cm3)\n\nPCO2\u00d710\n17 (m3.m/(m2.s.Pa))\n\n \n\nFigure 89 \u2013 Comparison of carbon dioxide permeability of antioxidants/PLA based membranes against  the \n\nmost widely polymers in food packaging industry.

General Conclusions and Final \n\nRemarks  \n \n\n\n\n136 \n\n \n\nThis work shows that it is possible to improve PLA\u2019s properties by the addition of \n\nchosen amounts of specific antioxidants. Here, PLA based membranes were additivated \n\nwith synthetic (BHT and TBHQ) and natural (?-tocopherol) based antioxidants and further \n\ncharacterized for their final structural, morphological and barrier properties. This work \n\ndemonstrates that PLA\u2019s properties can be enhanced by incorporation of antioxidants such \n\nas BHT and TBHQ. The addition of 10 wt% of each of these antioxidants to PLA films \n\npromotes the decrease of their Tg, which is important to improve the flexural properties of \n\nPLA. Based on this study, complementary studies, such as elastic modulus measurements, \n\nare needed in order to better understand this behaviour and deeply evaluate the impact of \n\nthose antioxidants on the flexibility of TBHQ/PLA based films.  \n\n Regarding the introduction of ?-tocopherol in PLA based membranes, new \n\nstrategies are needed to enhance the compatibility between this antioxidant and the PLA \n\nmatrix. Also, the yellowish colour of the PLA/?-tocopherol films needs to be investigated.  \n\n A time-lag apparatus was build during this thesis so that carbon dioxide and oxygen \n\nbarrier properties of the several prepared films could be studied. Good agreement with \n\nliterature data was obtained for pure PLA\u2019s films permeability towards carbon dioxide and \n\noxygen. The incorporation of only 2 wt% of BHT and TBHQ in the PLA matrix can \n\ndecrease the carbon dioxide permeability by 44 % and 30 % and the oxygen permeability \n\nby 40 % and 20 %, respectively. Films containing 4 wt% of ?-tocopherol present carbon \n\ndioxide and oxygen permeability which are very similar to those of pure PLA.  \n\n It would be interesting to study PLA with higher molecular weight, since the Tg of \n\nPLA increases with molecular weight, the additivation of PLA with 2 wt% of antioxidants \n\nmay not represent a problem, regarding the transition to the rubbery state.  \n\n Considering the good results obtained after incorporation of TBHQ into PLA, films \n\nenriched with TBHQ amounts approved by FDA should be investigated. However, it \n\nshould be noted that this compound is prohibited in Canada and in the European Union \n\nwhich highlights the need for the use of natural based antioxidant alternatives. Since the \n\ncompatibility between the ?-tocopherol and the PLA matrix seems unlikely, based on the \n\nresults obtained in this work, it should be interesting to find other potential candidates, \n\nsuch as rosemary extracts, which already revealed powerful antioxidant properties being \n\nable to simultaneously work as plasticizers.  \n\n \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6.

By repeating the same gas expansion procedure with and without a calibration \n\nvolume in either thanks involved, and using the ideal gas law, one can easily obtain the \n\nvolume of the permeate tank.  \n\n \n\nFor determining the volume of the tanks, were carried out the following steps: \n\n \n\na) Perform vacuum in both tanks, initially empty; \n\nb) Close de valve between the tanks A and B (see Figure 91); \n\nc) Introduce nitrogen in tank A until a given pressure, PA, is reached; \n\nd) Open de valve between tank A and tank B, and record the equilibrium pressure; \n\ne) Performing the above steps at least 10 times. \n\n \n\nA\nB\n\n \n\nFigure 91 - Empty tanks. \n\nNote: this figure was adapted from Ref.131 \n\n \n\nIn the step a), the number of moles remaining after the evacuation is given by the \n\nfollowing expression: \n\n \n\n\n\n147 \n\n \n\n( )\nRT\n\nVVP\nnn BA\n\nBA\n\n+\n=+\n\n0\n00\n\n                                                                                                            (30) \n\n \n\nwhere n is the number of moles of the gas, VA the volume of tank A, VB, volume of tank B,  \n\nP\n0 \n\n the pressure for initial conditions, R the universal gas constant and T the absolute \n\ntemperature.  \n\nThe number of moles of the gas, n, that was introduced in tank A, in step c), is given by the \n\nfollowing expression  \n\nRT\n\nVPP\nn A\n\nA\n\nA\n\n)(\n0?\n\n=                                                                                                                        (31) \n\n \n\nAfter opening the valve between the two tanks, a new equilibrium is reached, P\nAB\n\n, and the \n\nnumber of moles of the gas in both tanks is given by: \n\n \n\nRT\n\nVVP\nnn BA\n\nAB\ne\n\nB\n\ne\n\nA\n\n)( +\n=+                                                                                                         (32) \n\nAs,  \n\n \n\n00\n\nBAA\n\ne\n\nB\n\ne\n\nA\nnnnnn ++=+                                                                                                             (33) \n\n \n\nThe combination of equations (30), (31), (32) and (33), allows to obtain the following \n\nrelation between the tank\u2019s volume: \n\n \n\n1\n\n0\n\n?=\n?\n\n?\n=\n\nABA\n\nAB\n\nB\n\nA\n\nPP\n\nPP\n\nV\n\nV\n                                                                                                                  (34) \n\n \n\nThen, the tank B is filled with spheres of glass, which were previously weight, as shown in \n\nFigure 92 . \n\n \n\n\n\n148 \n\n \n\nA\n\nB\n\n \n\nFigure 92 -  Tank A empty and tank B with spheres of glass. \n\nNote: this figure was adapted from Ref.\n131\n\n \n\n \n\nCarried out the previous steps a) to e) but now with the tank B filled with spheres of glass, \n\nwhich have a volume V\nS\n, determinates from the relationship between the density of the \n\nglass and the mass of the spheres. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe number of moles of gas inside the tanks, in beginning, is given by: \n\n \n\n( )\nRT\n\nVVVP\nnn SBA\n\nBA\n\n?+\n=+\n\n0\n00\n\n                                                                                                    (35) \n\n \n\n \n\nThe number of moles of the gas, n, that was introduced in tank A, in step c), is given by the \n\nfollowing expression: \n\n \n\nRT\n\nVPP\nn AA\n\nA\n\n)(\n0?\n\n=                                                                                                                         (36) \n\nAfter opening the valve between the two tanks, the number of moles of the gas both tanks \n\nis given by: \n\nRT\n\nVVVP\nnn SBA\n\nAB\ne\n\nB\n\ne\n\nA\n\n)( ?+\n=+                                                                                               (37) \n\n Therefore, \n\n \n00\n\nBAA\n\ne\n\nB\n\ne\n\nA\nnnnnn ++=+                                                                                                               (38) \n\n\n\n149 \n\n \n\n \n\nCombining the equation (35) to (38), one obtains the relation between the two tank\u2019s \n\nvolumes:  \n\n \n\n2\n\n0\n\n?=\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n?\nA\n\nAB\n\nAB\n\nSB\n\nA\n\nPP\n\nPP\n\nVV\n\nV\n                                                                                                       (39) \n\n \n\n \n\nSolving the system of equations composed by equations (34) and (39), the volume of each \n\ntank is given by following equations: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSB\nVV\n\n12\n\n2\n\n??\n?\n?\n\n=                                                                                                                                    (40) \n\n \n\nand \n \n\n \n\n \n\nSA\nVV\n\n12\n\n21\n\n??\n??\n?\n\n=                                                                                                                                    (41) \n\n \n\n \n\nApplying the above equations to our system, the following results were obtained: \n\n \n\n?1 = 0,7498;
