This poorly selective harvest strategy catches \n\nlarge amounts of unwanted species that are thrown overboard for various reasons. \n\nHowever, survival of discards is not yet properly assessed and constitutes an essential \n\nparameter for the upcoming landing obligation, with an exemption for species with \n\n\u201chigh survival\u201d. In this work, time-to-mortality and a vitality assessment were used to \n\nestimate immediate mortality and identify important biological characteristics on the \n\nsusceptibility of a group of 14 by-catch species, most with commercial interest (Conger \n\nconger, Galeus melastomus, Helicolenus dactylopterus, Lepidorhombus boscii, Lophius \n\nbudegassa, Lophius piscatorius, Merluccius merluccius, Micromesistius poutassou, \n\nMullus surmuletus, Phycis blennoides, Scyliorhinus canicula, Trigla lyra, Trachurus \n\ntrachurus and Trachurus picturatus). Only S. canicula and C. conger were identified as \n\nspecies with potential to survive after the discarding process. Present results on time-to-\n\nmortality show significant differences when comparing individual sizes for some \n\nspecies, with smaller individuals dying faster than larger ones. Furthermore, species \n\nwith scales, gas bladder and high metabolic rates are more vulnerable to die after being \n\ndiscarded. A short captive observation experiment with C. conger was conducted, with \n\n84% survival after 65 hours of monitoring. However, this survival rate is likely to be \n\noverestimated due to two facts: 1) the mortality rate did not stabilize at the end of the \n\nexperiment; and 2) the majority of individuals showed severe injuries (scratches, bruises \n\nand deep wounds). These outcomes can help to identify species that will likely survive \n\nthe discarding process, factors influencing its survival and provide reliable estimates of \n\nunaccounted fishing mortality, essential for stock management and conservation. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: by-catch and discards; time-to-mortality; biological traits; survival; \n\ntrawling; South Portugal \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nIV \n \n\nRESUMO \n\nO arrasto de fundo \u00e9 uma das artes de pesca mais comum em todo o mundo, apesar dos \n\nseus impactos destrutivos: desde modifica\u00e7\u00f5es na morfologia dos fundos marinhos e \n\nressuspens\u00e3o de sedimentos a altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos ciclos de nutrientes e biodiversidade em \n\n\u00e1guas profundas. Devido \u00e0 sua natureza n\u00e3o selectiva, as redes de arrasto capturam \n\ngrandes quantidades de esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o desejadas que s\u00e3o posteriormente rejeitadas, no \n\ncaso de n\u00e3o terem valor comercial, quota ou outras restri\u00e7\u00f5es legislativas (tamanhos \n\nm\u00ednimos legais, limites de percentagem de esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o-alvo). De modo a evitar este \n\nproblema, uma obriga\u00e7\u00e3o de desembarque tem vindo a ser implementada com a reforma \n\nda Pol\u00edtica Comum de Pescas, que for\u00e7a os pescadores a manter a bordo e descarregar \n\ntodas as esp\u00e9cies que possuem uma quota (ou total admiss\u00edvel de captura). No entanto, \n\nexistem v\u00e1rias excep\u00e7\u00f5es a esta legisla\u00e7\u00e3o. Uma delas \u00e9 para esp\u00e9cies com \u2018elevada \n\nsobreviv\u00eancia\u2019, que podem continuar a ser rejeitadas desde que haja evid\u00eancias \n\ncient\u00edficas que suportem esta decis\u00e3o, da\u00ed a import\u00e2ncia de averiguar a sobreviv\u00eancia \n\ndas rejei\u00e7\u00f5es.  \n\nA frota de arrast\u00f5es de marisco em Portugal tem como esp\u00e9cies-alvo o lagostim \n\n(Nephrops norvegicus), a gamba-branca (Parapenaeus longirostris) e o camar\u00e3o-\n\nvermelho (Aristeus antennatus), operando sobretudo ao largo dos canh\u00f5es de Lagos, \n\nPortim\u00e3o e Faro. Este segmento da frota representa menos de 4 % do total de licen\u00e7as \n\nde pesca, mas os crust\u00e1ceos capturados s\u00e3o o grupo mais caro, atingindo pre\u00e7os de 16 \n\neuros por kg em 2016. Contudo, a taxa de rejei\u00e7\u00e3o de pescado aproxima-se dos 70 %, \n\ncom mais de 90 esp\u00e9cies de vertebrados e invertebrados. V\u00e1rios projectos dedicados ao \n\nestudo das rejei\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00eam vindo a ser realizados, com foco na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies, \n\nquantifica\u00e7\u00e3o das taxas de rejei\u00e7\u00e3o e impactos ecol\u00f3gicos e econ\u00f3micos. Estrat\u00e9gias de \n\nmitiga\u00e7\u00e3o como diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do comprimento do saco da rede e sistemas de grelhas \n\nselectivas foram testadas, mas apenas as grelhas demonstraram efici\u00eancia em reduzir a \n\ncaptura de peixe n\u00e3o desejado, sem afectar significativamente a captura de crust\u00e1ceos. \n\nUm aumento do tamanho da malha no saco de 55 para 70 mm tamb\u00e9m produziu \n\nresultados significativos em termos de redu\u00e7\u00e3o de pescado rejeitado. No entanto, \n\nnenhuma destas altera\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas foi adaptada pelos pescadores, devido a poss\u00edveis \n\nimpactos econ\u00f3micos. Artes de pesca est\u00e1ticas como armadilhas para lagostim e gamba \n\nt\u00eam vindo a ser investigadas como alternativa ao arrasto de fundo, pois produzem \n\nreduzidos impactos nos habitats marinhos e quase nenhum pescado \u00e9 rejeitado.  \n\n\n\n \n\nV \n \n\nQuanto \u00e0 sobreviv\u00eancia das rejei\u00e7\u00f5es, experi\u00eancias com esp\u00e9cies n\u00e3o desejadas de peixe \n\ne caranguejos pescados com ganchorra mostraram taxas de sobreviv\u00eancia entre 54% e \n\n81% ap\u00f3s 48 horas em cativeiro. No cerco, 20% a 80% da sardinha sobreviveu ap\u00f3s a \n\ncaptura e durante um m\u00eas em tanques. No arrasto de fundo, apenas estudos com \n\nlagostim foram concretizados, com taxas de sobreviv\u00eancia entre 13% e 60%, mas \n\nnenhum sobre esp\u00e9cies rejeitadas. H\u00e1 tr\u00eas metodologias principais que podem ser \n\nusadas na investiga\u00e7\u00e3o da sobreviv\u00eancia: estudos de vitalidade; observa\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\ncativeiro; e estudos de marca\u00e7\u00e3o-recaptura ou biotelemetria. Escalas de vitalidade e \n\nindicadores como tempo-para-mortalidade podem ser aplicados para avaliar a \n\nsobreviv\u00eancia imediata. Apesar de n\u00e3o conseguirem prever mortalidade ap\u00f3s rejei\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nestes m\u00e9todos s\u00e3o simples de aplicar e fornecem informa\u00e7\u00e3o relevante para um elevado \n\nn\u00famero de esp\u00e9cies. A observa\u00e7\u00e3o em cativeiro consiste na captura de animais \n\nselvagens que, antes de serem rejeitados, s\u00e3o transferidos para tanques ou outras \n\ninstala\u00e7\u00f5es e monitorizados durantes dias at\u00e9 semanas. Idealmente, a experi\u00eancia de \n\nsobreviv\u00eancia deve prolongar-se at\u00e9 a taxa de mortalidade estabilizar. Esta metodologia \n\nimplica maiores custos e log\u00edstica quando comparada com a anterior. No entanto, \n\npermite estimar de forma mais fi\u00e1vel a taxa de sobreviv\u00eancia e fazer infer\u00eancias acerca \n\nda sobreviv\u00eancia a longo-prazo ap\u00f3s rejei\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nEste trabalho est\u00e1 dividido em duas partes: 1) estudo das susceptibilidades das esp\u00e9cies \n\nrejeitadas; 2) experi\u00eancia de sobreviv\u00eancia a curto prazo com congro (Conger conger). \n\nAmbas foram realizadas a bordo de um arrast\u00e3o em pesca comercial. No primeiro, \n\nforam usados indicadores de sobreviv\u00eancia imediata para um grupo de 14 esp\u00e9cies: \n\nescalas de vitalidade com 4 categorias, desde excelente estado a moribundo; tempo-\n\npara-mortalidade, ou tempo at\u00e9 o animal n\u00e3o apresentar qualquer sinal de vida, quando \n\nexposto ao ar; e registo de v\u00e1rios tipos de les\u00f5es externas, como perda de escamas, \n\narranh\u00f5es ou feridas expostas. Estes indicadores permitem distinguir esp\u00e9cies com \n\npotencial de sobreviv\u00eancia. Por\u00e9m, a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da vitalidade necessita de ser adaptada \n\n\u00e0s particularidades de cada esp\u00e9cie, sobretudo a animais de profundidade que possuem \n\nestrat\u00e9gias de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o de energia quando em situa\u00e7\u00f5es de stress extremo. Foram \n\ntamb\u00e9m identificadas caracter\u00edsticas biol\u00f3gicas que determinam a vulnerabilidade destas \n\nesp\u00e9cies: tamanho do animal, bexiga-natat\u00f3ria, escamas e taxa metab\u00f3lica. Para \n\nalgumas esp\u00e9cies, o tamanho dos indiv\u00edduos representou um factor relevante, pois \n\nanimais mais pequenos s\u00e3o mais vulner\u00e1veis e morrem mais rapidamente do que \n\n\n\n \n\nVI \n \n\nanimais de maiores dimens\u00f5es. Para al\u00e9m disso, esp\u00e9cies com escamas, bexiga-natat\u00f3ria \n\ne taxas metab\u00f3licas elevadas tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o menos resistentes e t\u00eam reduzidas hip\u00f3teses \n\nde sobreviverem ap\u00f3s rejei\u00e7\u00e3o. Apenas duas esp\u00e9cies surgiram como candidatas a \n\nestudos mais pormenorizados para averiguar o seu potencial de sobreviv\u00eancia: pata-roxa \n\n(Scyliorhinus canicula) e congro ou safio (Conger conger). Assim, na segunda parte \n\ndeste estudo, 84% dos congros sobreviveram ap\u00f3s 65 horas de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o. Contudo, \n\nesta taxa de sobreviv\u00eancia est\u00e1 sobrestimada devido a duas problem\u00e1ticas: a mortalidade \n\nn\u00e3o estabilizou no final do per\u00edodo de observa\u00e7\u00f5es, ou seja, se a experi\u00eancia tivesse sido \n\nmais prolongada, ainda iria registar-se maior mortalidade; e cerca de 70% dos animais \n\napresentaram les\u00f5es externas severas, o que coloca s\u00e9rias quest\u00f5es acerca da sua \n\nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o e sobreviv\u00eancia ap\u00f3s rejei\u00e7\u00e3o. Para estudos futuros, recomenda-se \n\nexperi\u00eancias de sobreviv\u00eancia mais prolongadas, em tanques em terra, de modo a evitar \n\nos problemas de espa\u00e7o e log\u00edstica que implicam trabalhar num navio. As metodologias \n\nescolhidas neste trabalho limitaram as conclus\u00f5es obtidas, mas ao mesmo tempo \n\nimplicaram uma estrat\u00e9gia de obter informa\u00e7\u00e3o nova e importante, com baixo custo, que \n\npode ser usada como ponto de partida para outros projectos. Estes resultados \n\nidentificaram esp\u00e9cies que poder\u00e3o sobreviver ap\u00f3s a sua rejei\u00e7\u00e3o, factores que \n\ninfluenciam a sua sobreviv\u00eancia e estimativas de mortalidade provocadas pela pesca que \n\ns\u00e3o essenciais \u00e0 gest\u00e3o e conserva\u00e7\u00e3o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: rejei\u00e7\u00f5es; tempo-para mortalidade e vitalidade; caracter\u00edsticas \n\nbiol\u00f3gicas; sobreviv\u00eancia; arrasto de fundo; Algarve \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nVII \n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Mean landings of landed fish on Portuguese ports by main species groups \n\nin 2016.

INTRODUCTION \n\nMost marine fisheries are mixed fisheries directed towards only a few commercial target \n\nspecies but along with the target species, a variable and often high number of by-catch \n\nspecies is captured (Borges &amp; O\u2019Dor 2010). The Algarve deep-water trawl fishery \n\ntargets three main crustacean species (Parapenaeus longirostris, Nephrops norvegicus \n\nand Aristeus antennatus) at fishing depths of between 200 and 700 meters. Sweeping \n\nthe seabed with heavy ground gear imposes serious consequences for benthic \n\necosystems. Also, a number of unwanted species are caught and often rejected \n\noverboard. This study aimed at studying the vulnerability and survival potential of these \n\ndiscarded species, taking into account biological factors that determine their mortality.  \n\n \n\n1.1 The by-catch problem  \n\nBottom trawling represents one of the most common fishing practices around the \n\nworld despite its severe impacts on marine ecosystems, causing modifications in sea-\n\nbottom morphology and resuspension of sediments. As a result, alterations on the \n\nnutrient cycles and benthic biodiversity are evidences of its potential consequences \n\n(Pusceddu et al. 2014; Clark et al. 2015). Trawl nets as the ones used in crustacean \n\ndemersal trawlers collect an extensive range of species and sizes, thus have high by-\n\ncatch rates, meaning amounts of unwanted species that are hauled on-board. For a clear \n\ndefinition, by-catch is defined as any organism caught unintentionally, while discards \n\nare the portion of the catch which is not used and thrown away at sea (Borges &amp; O\u2019Dor \n\n2010). In fact, by-catch can represent a large proportion of total catch and may be high \n\nin species diversity, especially in demersal mixed-species fisheries. In the Portuguese \n\ndemersal trawl fishery, close to 80% of total catch weight is discarded, composed by \n\nmore than 90 vertebrate and invertebrate species (Borges et al. 1997). Some of these \n\nspecies have economic value and are retained and sold, while others are discarded \n\noverboard due to no marketable value, quota or other legal restrictions (minimum \n\nlanding sizes, catch composition regulations; Borges et al. 2001; Costa et al. 2008; \n\nErzini et al. 2002). \u201cThe discard problem\u201d raises a number of issues, from policy and \n\nethical implications, fisheries management, to ecological, economic and technical \n\nconcerns (Kelleher 2005).   Discards, when dead, may have serious consequences on the \n\npopulations of target and non-target species, especially if the majority of the rejected \n\n\n\n \n\n2 \n\n \n\nspecimens are undersized, which can lead to decreases in future yield and reproducing \n\npossibilities (Tingley et al. 2000). At the same time, fisheries discards and offal \n\nrepresent an important source of food mainly for benthic scavengers and invertebrates, \n\nand also for mid-water opportunistic species such as sharks, marine mammals and \n\nseabirds (Veiga et al. 2015; Votier et al. 2004; Olaso et al. 1998). The combined effect \n\nof trawling disturbance and discards may favour the rapid and short-term growth of \n\nsmall scavenger benthic species of amphipods and isopods for example, leading to \n\nimportant alterations of deep-water trophic webs and species interactions (Bellido et al. \n\n2011; Kelleher 2005; Castro et al. 2005). \n\nWhen comparing reported discard estimates from European Union (EU) \n\nlogbooks with those obtained by scientific observers, the reported by-catch represented \n\nonly 0.06% of the weight recorded by researchers (STECF 2013). Thus, by-catch and \n\ndiscards studies are essential not only to quantify the impacts of discarding practices on \n\nfish stocks but also to understand to which extent fishing activities affect and alter the \n\nmarine environment. \n\n \n\n1.2 The Landing Obligation \n\nIn terms of fisheries management of European Union fleets, the Common \n\nFisheries Policy (CFP) aims to promote fisheries that should exploit marine resources in \n\nan environmentally, economically and socially sustainable way. To achieve this, an \n\necosystem-based approach shall be applied to minimise negative impacts of fishing \n\nactivities on marine ecosystems. Moreover, the CFP targets the restoring or \n\nmaintenance of fish stocks above biomass levels capable of producing maximum \n\nsustainable yield, which means the highest theoretical amount that can be constantly \n\ntaken from a stock under regular environmental conditions without significantly \n\ndisturbing the reproduction process (European Union 2013). Another management tool \n\nfocusing on protection of marine biodiversity resources is the Marine Strategic \n\nFramework Directive (MSFD) with the main goal to achieve a good environmental \n\nstatus of EU\u2019s marine waters (European Commission 2016). All these goals were \n\nplanned to be achieved no later than 2020, together with a gradual elimination of \n\ndiscards through the introduction of a discard ban. This key modification obligates \n\nfishermen to keep on board and land all regulated species; i.e., species under quotas \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n\n \n\n(total allowable catches or TACs) or minimum conservation reference sizes (MCRS, in \n\nthe Mediterranean). For this, species with TACs will suffer quota increments in order to \n\nrepresent real total catch, consequently increasing fishing mortality. For species with \n\nlimited quota, these can become \u2018choke species\u2019, forcing the vessel to stop fishing once \n\nthe quota is reached. However, there are several exceptions to this regulation in which \n\nthe release of animals will still be permitted. This includes species with special \n\nconservation status as rays and sharks for which fishing is prohibited (European Union \n\n2017). \n\n1.2.1 \u2018High survival\u2019 exemption \n\n An exemption for \u201cspecies for which scientific evidence demonstrates high \n\nsurvival rates\u201d is in place, but the term \u2018high survival\u2019 is not absolutely defined and \n\nmight induce some ambiguity. To capture and keep on-board species that may survive \n\nthe discarding process can also have negative impacts on spawning stock biomass, so \n\nthis exemption should be applied in a case-by-case basis considering detailed \n\ncharacteristics of the species and fisheries (STECF 2013; paragraph 4, Article 15, \n\nEuropean Union 2013). \n\n1.2.2 \u2018De minimis\u2019 exemption \n\n Moreover, de minimis exemptions were also created that allow for discarding of \n\n5% of TACs for each stock, in the most challenging circumstances, namely when \n\n\u201cimprovements in selectivity are considered to be very difficult\u201d and \u201cdisproportionate \n\ncosts of handling unwanted catches do not represent more than a certain percentage\u201d, \n\nconcepts that also contain subjectivity in how to express \u2018difficulties in improving \n\nselectivity\u2019 and \u2018disproportionate costs\u2019. The problem of improving selectivity is that \n\nimplies changing the current fishing practices that might decrease the revenues of the \n\nfleet. So, the real issue are the economic repercussions of increasing selectivity instead \n\nof a technical \u2018difficulty\u2019 (STECF 2013; paragraph 5, Article 15, European Union \n\n2013). \n\n1.2.3 Inter-species and inter-annual quota flexibilities \n\n In order to avoid \u2018choke species\u2019, a mechanism of inter-species quota flexibility \n\nwas also introduced to offer a method of exchanging quota from a target species (donor) \n\nto a non-target species (recipient), up to 9% of the quota of the target species. This can \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n\n \n\noccur when a vessel has finished its quota for a specific stock and needs to stop fishing \n\nin areas where that species is caught, irrespective of how much quota it has for other \n\nstocks in the same area (STECF 2013; paragraph 8, Article 15, European Union 2013). \n\nHowever, the recipient non-target stock must be inside safe biological limits, otherwise \n\nthis flexibility cannot be applied. An inter-annual quota flexibility of 10% of the TAC \n\ncan similarly be used for species under the landing obligation (paragraph 9, Article 15, \n\nEuropean Union 2013). \n\nTheoretically, these exceptions shall only be applied after other technical \n\nmethods to avoid capture of unwanted species have been tested, because the combined \n\napplication of the exemptions might provide a way of continuing to discard species as \n\nformerly. This might discourage the objectives of improving exploitation patterns and \n\nminimising unwanted catches (STECF 2013, 2014). \n\n1.2.4 Possible negatives outcomes \n\n Following this landing obligation, logistic and economic complications might \n\nemerge due to increased sorting time and storage on board of former non-kept species \n\nthat can lead to greater costs and/or lower incomes. Currently, there are no prepared \n\ninstallations or procedures on harbours to manage landed discards (Veiga et al. 2015). \n\nBesides, previously discarded species cannot be used for direct human consumption, so \n\nshould be processed for other means as fish meal and oil, pet food, pharmaceuticals and \n\ncosmetics (European Union 2013). This additional burden may cause non-compliance \n\nwith the no-discard policy if considered as unfeasible by fishermen (STECF 2014). \n\nExamining fishers\u2019 perceptions and behaviour can help to understand likely \n\ncomplications that might arise from the landing obligation (Villasante et al. 2016). As \n\nan example, even when applying exemptions, the results of modelling the impact of the \n\nlanding obligation in UK demersal fisheries show that only 39% of the available quota \n\ncould be landed in 2019, causing a drastic reduction of revenue, mainly due to the \n\nproblematic of choke species (Russell et al. 2016).  \n\nThe evaluation of economic and social impacts of the landing obligation at this \n\ninitial period is still being developed (European Commission 2016b). In Norway, the \n\n\u2018discard ban package\u2019, implemented throughout the last 30 years, combines strategies \n\nsuch as a system of little  compensation for fishermen with landing discards (only to pay \n\nthe costs) and real-time closed areas when by-catch reached a certain percentage, which \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n\n \n\nwould obligate the vessel to travel to another fishing area. Together with other technical \n\nmeasures (e.g. grid sorting systems), this scheme promoted incentives to fish more \n\nselectively and allowed a quick recovery of the exploited stocks (Diamond &amp; Beukers-\n\nStewart 2011). However, current economic incentives in European fisheries seem to \n\nencourage the usual discarding routines and retain the maximum amount of commercial \n\nspecies instead of focusing in changing exploitation patterns and fisher\u2019s practices \n\n(STECF 2013; Zimmermann et al. 2015).  \n\nAccurate information about discard rates and survival of rejected specimens is \n\nessential to determine sources of unaccounted fishing mortality and thus calculate \n\ncorrectly fishing at maximum sustainable yield level and other biological reference \n\npoints (STECF 2013). Moreover, with increases in quotas for regulated species in order \n\nto account for the former discards that will be landed, the stock assessments need to be \n\nas exact as possible to maintain the primary goal of sustainable use of fisheries \n\nresources. \n\n \n\n1.3 The Portuguese trawl fishery \n\nThe trawling fleet in Portugal is composed mainly by vessels targeting fish and \n\ncrustaceans, with distinct m\u00e9tiers and regulation measures, operating at a minimum \n\ndistance of six nautical miles off the coast. The crustacean bottom trawlers have limited \n\nlicenses, for two separate mesh size categories: 55-59 mm mesh size with which target \n\nspecies have to compose 30% of total catch and 70 mm net mesh size when targeting \n\nNorway lobster (Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica 2000). The fish trawling fleet targets mainly semi-\n\npelagic species, such as horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus) and Atlantic mackerel \n\n(Scomber scombrus); and uses nets with 65-69 mm mesh size, where 70% of total catch \n\nmust be composed by these target species. These by-catch limitations have been one of \n\nthe main reasons for discarding of commercial species (Campos 2003). Besides being \n\nmanaged by catches limits (total allowable catches or TACs) and technical measures \n\n(minimum conservation reference size or MCRS), control of the fishing effort can also \n\nbe done for these fleets by implementing closed seasons, as for rose shrimp \n\n(Parapenaeus longirostris; Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica 2006). However, the implementation of \n\na minimum landing size is not always in agreement with the biological characteristics of \n\nthe species, often being below the size of first maturation (Campos 2003). For instance, \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n\n \n\nminimum landing size for European hake is set at 27 cm, though the length of first \n\nmaturity is nearly 33 cm for male and 45 cm for female (Pi\u00f1eiro &amp; Sa\u00ednza 2003). The \n\nsame occurs for other species: Trachurus trachurus has a MCRS of 15 cm, while the \n\nlength of first maturation ranges from 21 to 30 cm; Conger conger reaches first \n\nmaturation at minimum of 2 meters length, but the MCRS in Portuguese legislation is \n\n57 cm. For one of the main target, Norway lobster, a minimum landing size of 20 mm \n\nwas set despite reaching maturity at 23 mm of carapace length (Abell\u00f3 &amp; Sard\u00e1 1982; \n\nFroese &amp; Pauly 2016; Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica 2001).  \n\nThis deep-water crustacean fishery targets the rose shrimp P. longirostris, the \n\nred shrimp Aristeus antennatus and the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus and \n\nconcentrates around the Canyons of Lagos, Portim\u00e3o and Faro (Barlavento or occidental \n\ncoast of the Algarve). The substrate of these fishing grounds is composed mainly by a \n\nmixture of silt and mud, the preferred habitat of the target species (Silva et al. 2014). \n\nThe distributions of the three crustacean species overlap, but P. longirostris is \n\ncommonly found between 200 and 400 m depths, while A. antennatus from 300 to 600 \n\nm depths; N. norvegicus has an uneven distribution between 200 and 700 m (Monteiro \n\net al. 2001). During recent years, the landings of rose shrimp have been increasing in \n\ncontrast with the declining catches of Norway lobster, possibly due to the restrictions in \n\nquota and fishing closures imposed for N. norvegicus to allow for the recovery of the \n\nstock, as well as an increased abundance of rose shrimp (Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica 2016; \n\nSilva et al. 2010). Despite the fact that trawlers only represent around 3.7% of the total \n\nnumber of Portuguese fishing licenses, they are a very important segment of the \n\nPortuguese fleet. For example, the mean commercial value of the crustacean species \n\nwas more than 16 euros per kg and at the same time represented around 1% of total \n\nlandings in 2016 (Figures 1.1 and 1.2; INE 2017). \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 - Mean landings of landed fish on Portuguese ports by main species groups in 2016. \n\nWeight in tonnes was converted in weight as percentage (INE 2017). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 - Mean prices per kilogram of landed fish on Portuguese ports by main species \n\ngroups in 2016 (INE 2017). \n\n \n\nAfter 60 years of heavy trawling the seafloor in south and southwest Portuguese \n\ncoasts, there is evidence of erosion and degradation of the sea bottom. This leads to \n\nalterations in habitat structure and biodiversity, with increased risk for particular \n\necosystems such as crinoid beds that host a diverse number of taxa (Morais et al. 2007; \n\nFonseca et al. 2014). Another relevant effect of this fishing activity is the diversity and \n\namounts of unwanted species discarded primarily due to low or no commercial value \n\n84% \n\n15% \n\n0% \n\n1% \n\n1% \n\nMarine fish Molluscs Brackish and freshwater species Crustaceans\n\n9.46 \n\n15.98 \n\n3.2 \n\n1.75 \n\nBrackish and\n\nfreshwater species\n\nCrustaceans Molluscs Marine fish\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nE\nu\n\nr\no\n\ns/\nk\n\ng\n \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n\n \n\n(Borges et al. 1997, 2000, 2002). Previous work has shown discard rates of \n\napproximately 70% in crustacean trawlers (Monteiro et al. 2001; Costa et al. 2008), \n\nmeaning weight of by-catch surpassing largely the weight of target species. The main \n\ndiscarded fish species are blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), European hake \n\n(Merluccius merluccius), Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus Trachurus) and blue jack \n\nmackerel (Trachurus picturatus), conger (Conger conger) and shark species \n\n(Scyliorhinus canicula, Galeus melastomus, Etmopterus spp.). Fish communities change \n\naccording to depth range; in shallow waters until 120 meters deep, horse mackerel and \n\naxillary seabream compose most of the total biomass; while in deeper waters the \n\nbiomass is dominated by blue whiting and hake, so by-catch composition will reflect \n\nthese differences (Gomes et al. 2001). By-catch species under catch quotas (or TACs) in \n\nthis fishery are M. merluccius, Trachurus spp., Lophius spp., Micromesistius poutassou, \n\nLepidorhombus spp., and more recently Phycis blennoides (European Union 2016, \n\n2017). All are commercially valuable species, but discarded due to quota limitations and \n\nminimum landing sizes (or minimum conservation reference sizes).  \n\nSeveral exceptions to the landing obligation are already in place for this fishery. Blue \n\nwhiting (M. poutassou), despite representing the most discarded species in terms of \n\nweight, is not included in the 70% maximum percentage of by-catch species (Di\u00e1rio da \n\nRep\u00fablica 2000; Monteiro et al. 2001). A \u2018de minimis\u2019 exemption for hake (M. \n\nmerluccius) is in place; up to 7% of the TAC can still be discarded based on the fact that \n\n\u2018viable increases in selectivity are very difficult to achieve\u2019, that could make the fishery \n\npossibly unprofitable (European Union 2015)\n1\n. Hake was considered a choke species in \n\nthe North Sea Nephrops trawlers, obligating the fishery to stop working earlier due to \n\nquota exhaustion, even when applying quota uplifts of 20% (STECF 2014). In \n\nPortuguese waters, if an exemption was not in place, hake would also be a choke \n\nspecies because it is one of the most discarded species and at the same time only 3142 \n\ntonnes can be landed by all fleets in national waters (European Union 2017). A recovery \n\nplan for hake and Norway lobster was agreed in 2005 with the aim to rebuild the stocks \n\nto safe biological limits until 2015 (European Union 2005). Based on this recovery plan, \n\nthe efforts should go to decreasing fishing mortality rates, which the recent exemption \n\nentirely contradicts since allows fishermen to continue discarding this species. These \n\nregulative measures do not encourage fisher\u2019s compliance or adoption of alternatives to \n\nreduce by-catches (Campos et al. 2014). \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n\n \n\n1.4 By-catch in Portuguese fisheries \n\nThe knowledge about by-catch and discards in the Algarve (South Portugal) and \n\nthe resultant ecological and economic consequences has been enriched since mid-90, \n\nwith three European-funded projects with the goal to quantify and manage discards \n\n(\u201cDISCARDS\u201d, \u201cDISCALG\u201d and \u201cBYDISCARD\u201d projects; Borges et al. 1997, 2000, \n\n2002). The first two projects (from 1996 to 2000) focused on identifying and \n\nquantifying discards and understanding the reasons for discarding of the most important \n\nfishing m\u00e9tiers of southern Portugal (trammel net, demersal purse seine, pelagic purse \n\nseine, fish trawl and crustacean trawl). The demersal purse seine and the trammel net in \n\nparticular were shown to have low discard rates. The latter study (\u201cBYDISCARD\u201d, \n\n1998-2000) was dedicated only to the three other gears (pelagic purse seine, fish trawl \n\nand crustacean trawl) that represent most concern in terms of discard quantities and \n\nrates. Nevertheless, discard studies on pelagic purse seine and trammel nets continue to \n\nbe done (Batista et al. 2009; Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2007; Mar\u00e7alo et al. 2006, 2008). Reasons \n\nfor discarding were generally economic such low market value, damaged or poor \n\nquality fish or species for which there is no readily available market or regulatory \n\nmeasures (excess quota, minimum size restrictions). Within the BYDISCARDS project, \n\naspects of the biology of by-catch species were considered together with accurate \n\nidentification and recording of discard rates; ecosystem\u2019s dynamics and economic \n\noutcomes of reduction of by-catch were also taken into account. A number of written-\n\noutcomes on by-catch and discarding practices from different fishing gears in the \n\nAlgarve were published (Monteiro et al. 2001; Borges et al. 2001; Erzini et al. 2002; \n\nCosta et al. 2008). Two devices aiming to minimise by-catch rates were investigated on \n\ncrustacean trawlers: changes in the sweep length of the trawl nets (18 and 90 m lengths) \n\nand a sorting-grid system. The modification in sweep length did not produced any \n\nrelevant results in terms of by-catch amounts and composition, but the sorting-grid \n\ndemonstrated significant efficiency in maintaining the catch of target species (95% of \n\nthe crustaceans) while allowing for the escapement of the most discarded fish species \n\n(73% escapement of blue whiting; Borges et al. 2002). Other studies related to codend \n\nselection investigating different mesh configurations and sizes were also performed, \n\nwith varying results (Campos et al. 2003; Fonseca et al. 2007; Campos &amp; Fonseca \n\n2004). For instance, an increase in cod end mesh size (55 to 70 mm) would be a \n\nreasonable and effective approach to avoid the catch of undersized shrimp and reduce \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n\n \n\nby 40% the amount of by-catch (Campos 2003). The use of a modified Nordmore \n\nsorting grid was also tested for by-catch reduction with high levels of exclusion of non-\n\ncommercial bycatch (48 to 74% exclusion rates), although simultaneously with short-\n\nterm losses of target species, from 4 to 15% (Fonseca et al. 2005). None of the latter by-\n\ncatch reduction devices was adopted into national law or used by fishermen. Present-\n\nday studies have proposed measures to transform bottom trawlers into more selective \n\ngears because the shift to low impact gears (e.g. traps) is a serious challenge.  Until their \n\neffectiveness is proven, alternative gears will not be accepted, even if it means \n\nconserving fuel and consequently decreasing costs with almost no by-catch. Low \n\nimpact, fuel efficient gears should be given more investment in order to explore their \n\npotential as future sustainable harvesting methods (Suuronen et al. 2011). \n\n Since 2014, a large-scale European Union funded project is being conducted  \n\nwith the aim to \u201cminimise unwanted catches by incentivising the adoption of fishing \n\ntechnologies and practices that reduce pre-harvest mortality and post-harvest discards, \n\nwhile avoiding damage to sensitive marine species and habitats\u201d (MINOUW 2016). \n\nSolutions that incentivise fishermen first to avoid unwanted catches will be developed, \n\nand where this cannot be feasible, approaches on how to utilise the landed by-catch \n\nsustainably will be experimented but without profit to the producer. The Algarve \n\ndemersal crustacean fishery is a case study in this project, since this harvest technology \n\nexplores deep-water habitats with great biodiversity resulting in high by-catch rates and \n\ndiscards ratios. By-catch reduction devices are further investigated and the possibilities \n\nfor alternative gears such as traps for Norway lobster and Deep-water rose shrimp are \n\nbeing tested in order to reduce unwanted catches and minimize overall impact. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n1\n To note that the trawling fleet is highly dependent on government subsidies not only to support the fuel \n\ncosts but also for maintenance and technological improvements of the vessels (Innes &amp; Pascoe 2009; \n\nJacket &amp; Pauly 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n\n \n\n1.5 Discard survival \n\nDuring the discarding process, a fish will be exposed to different influencing \n\nfactors and injurious events that will affect its potential for survival and must be \n\nproperly identified and described for the species and harvest strategy (ICES 2014).  \n\nRelevant works on estimating discard survival have been conducted in commercial \n\nfisheries and research vessels around the world (Davis 2002; Broadhurst et al. 2006; \n\nRevill 2012; Uhlmann &amp; Broadhurst 2015). For the Portuguese fisheries, a number of \n\nstudies of post-release survival of discarded fish and invertebrate species have been \n\ndone recently. Survival of N. norvegicus caught with trawlers and placed into cages \n\nranged between 12.5% and 60% (Castro et al. 2003). In contrast, for individuals initially \n\ncaught by traps, average survival rate reached 86% (Campos et al. 2015). Survival \n\nexperiments of by-catch fish (Trachinus vipera; Dicologlossa cuneata) and crab \n\n(Polybius henslowii) from bivalve dredges showed that 54 % to 81% of the individuals \n\ndied after 48 hours captivity (Leit\u00e3o et al. 2014). On purse seine fishing, Mar\u00e7alo et al. \n\n(2008) identified the main factors that affect early survival and stress reactions of \n\nsardine (Sardina pilchardus) after capture and holding in tanks, with survival rates \n\nvarying from 20% to 80% after a month of captivity. No studies have yet been done on \n\nthe survival of by-catch fish species in demersal trawlers in Portuguese waters.  \n\n1.5.1 Methodologies to study discard survival \n\nThe ICES working group on Methods for Estimating Discard Survival \n\n(WKMEDS) has been regularly producing reports for guidance on how to estimate \n\nlevels of discard survival in commercial fisheries (ICES 2014). Discard survival \n\nassessments can be conducted through three different methodologies: vitality \n\nassessment that gives estimates of immediate mortality; captive observation; and \n\ntagging/biotelemetry. There is no standard time frame to conduct a survival experiment, \n\nsince it depends on the study species, the factors influencing survival and the logistical \n\nlimitations of the investigation. Ideally, the experiment should continue until the \n\nmortality rates stabilizes, i.e. reaches an asymptote. Otherwise, mortality will be \n\nunderestimated.  \n\nVitality assessments can be applied as a first step of a survival study. Detailed \n\nand prolonged evaluations of discard mortality obtained by captive observation and \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n\n \n\ntagging are costly, technically difficult to acquire, and only available for a limited \n\nnumber of species and fisheries (e.g. Huse &amp; Vold 2010; Mar\u00e7alo et al. 2008; Campos \n\net al. 2015; Laptikhovsky 2004). So, semi-quantitative indicators that estimate the \n\ndegree of injury given by a vitality assessment and a coarse mortality indicator that \n\ncalculates time-to-mortality (TTM) are more cost effective preliminary assessments. \n\nComplementary studies are still needed to predict post-release survival of discards and \n\nto justify an exemption to the landing obligation. Nevertheless, these methods allow \n\nestimating immediate mortality, for a large number of species and over a wide range of \n\nconditions. Based on the outcomes, they can be used to distinguish species that \n\ndemonstrate potential for survival after discarding and may need further investigation \n\n(Beno\u00eet et al. 2013; Beno\u00eet et al. 2010; Depestele et al. 2014; STECF 2014). Captive \n\nobservation consists of transferring wild-caught animals (before being discarded) into \n\ntanks or other holding facilities (e.g. underwater cages) and monitoring them until the \n\nmortality rate stabilizes, which might take days to weeks or months. The survival \n\nestimate using this approach is representative of real fishing conditions and when \n\ncombined with previous vitality assessments, can give a more exact survival rate \n\n(excluding predation) illustrative of the particular fishery and species in study (ICES \n\n2014). This methodology has higher costs and logistics when compared with vitality \n\nassessments, but allows making inferences on long-term survival more realistically and \n\nsupported with statistical modelling.  \n\n1.5.2 Factors influencing discard survival \n\nDiscard mortality results from the interactions of the individuals with the fishing \n\ngear and is affected by environmental, technical and biological factors. A combination \n\nof these should be considered when designing a discard survival study (ICES, 2014; \n\nDavis 2002; Broadhurst et al. 2006; Revill 2012; Uhlmann &amp; Broadhurst 2015). There \n\nare a wide range of variables that can possibly be measured and taken into account. \n\nBiological traits, such as body size, presence and type of gas bladder, as well as other \n\ncovariates i.e. water and air temperature, sea conditions, tow duration and speed, size of \n\ntotal catch and its composition, have been shown to affect discard mortality, both within \n\nand between species (Beno\u00eet et al. 2013; Davis 2002; Broadhurst et al. 2006). This work \n\nprioritized the biological characteristics of the different species: body size, deciduous \n\nscales, injuries, presence and type of gas bladder and metabolic rates. These appear to \n\nbe the most influential factors and could be easily measured and analysed given the \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n\n \n\navailable resources. This information was compiled from general literature and field \n\nobservations; when detailed information was not available, species were given the same \n\ntrait category as other species within its family or order (Froese &amp; Pauly 2016; WoRMS \n\nEditorial Board 2016; IUCN 2016; FAO 2016; ICES-FishMap 2014; Hill &amp; \n\nWassenberg 1990; Jacobsen et al. 2002; Revill et al. 2005; Encyclopaedia Britannica \n\n2017). \n\nBody length  \n\nSmaller individuals appear to be more vulnerable to discard mortality due to \n\nincreased susceptibility to injury while crushing during the haul or greater exhaustion \n\nfrom swimming and trying to escape the trawl (Suuronen 2005). However, one effect \n\nthat can be considered more relevant is that fish of smaller size are likely to be more \n\nsusceptible to hypoxia due to their increased mass-specific metabolic rates and \n\nconsequently higher energy expenditures in breathing activities (Beno\u00eet et al. 2013).  \n\nGas bladder \n\nSpecies that possess gas bladder, especially a closed swim bladder, where there \n\nis no connection between this organ and the gut (physoclistous condition), suffer \n\nsignificantly increased mortality due to depressurization when fish are brought to \n\nsurface, such as extrusion of internal organs and the rupture of the gas bladder itself \n\n(Beno\u00eet et al. 2013). On the other hand, physostomous gas bladders (open bladders \n\nwhere there is a connection to the gut) allow for a regulation of the amount of gas via \n\nesophagus and therefore depressurization may not have such drastic effects. For \n\nindividuals without a swim bladder, it is assumed that depressurization effects would \n\nnot be so damaging when compared with organisms that hold a gas bladder (Broadhurst \n\net al. 2006). \n\nDeciduous scales \n\nLoss of scales can contribute to higher mortality of fish in the medium to long \n\nterm due to risk of infection. In the context of this work, deciduous or soft scales that \n\neasily fall off can represent a biological trait that increase susceptibility to injury and \n\ndesiccation when the fish are stressed and compressed together inside the trawl net as \n\nwell as when exposed to air after capture and handling (Beno\u00eet et al. 2013; Broadhurst \n\net al 2006). \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n\n \n\nMetabolic rate \n\nMetabolic rates of low activity level fish can be related with increased resistance \n\nto stress as a strategy to conserve energy of sedentary species (Helfman et al. 2009). So, \n\nmetabolic rate was considered as a possible explanatory variable in species \n\nsusceptibilities. This information was gathered from metabolism studies and when \n\nmetabolic rate values were not found at the species level, major groups were used \n\n(Clarke &amp; Johnston 1999; Yang et al. 1992; Cowles &amp; Childress 1995; Carlson et al. \n\n2004).  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.6 Objectives \n\n This project had two main goals: first, to study bycatch species susceptibilities; and \n\nsecond, to assess the potential survival of Conger conger in a short experiment. Both \n\nwere conducted on-board a commercial trawler. In the first part, vitality assessments \n\n(time-to-mortality or TTM and a categorical vitality assessment, CVA) were used to \n\nestimate immediate mortality of a group of 19 by-catch species, in order to prioritise \n\nwhich species might have the possibility to survive for further investigations. Also, the \n\neffects of biological traits (e.g. size, presence and type of gas bladder, scales, injuries \n\nand metabolic rate) on TTM were considered since these determine to a great degree the \n\nsusceptibility of a species to die after being caught and discarded. For the second study, \n\nindividuals of C. conger were caught and maintained in captivity to estimate the \n\nmortality rate. Types and number of injuries were also registered and related with the \n\nobserved mortality. C. conger was chosen because it demonstrated high possibility of \n\nsurvivorship in the initial assessment and no previous survival studies were found. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n\n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n2.1 Study of by-catch species susceptibilities \n\n2.1.1 Methodologies \n\nThree assessment methods were applied: a categorical vitality assessment (CVA), time-\n\nto-mortality (TTM) and evaluation of external injuries.  \n\n Categorical vitality assessment (CVA) \n\nCVA is based on four vitality classes (table 2.1) that consider at one extreme very lively \n\nand responsive fish (score 1) and at the other extreme, unresponsive and without any \n\nmovement fish (score 4). This method provides a scored index of an individual\u2019s vitality \n\nmay be used to infer potential discard survival (ICES 2014). \n\n Time-to-mortality (TTM) \n\nTTM is the time required to induce mortality during air exposure; previous works have \n\nindicated that air exposure is one of the greatest contributors to discard mortality rates, \n\nmaking this estimator a good discard mortality proxy (Benoit et al. 2012; Davis 2002; \n\nBroadhurst et al. 2006). Besides, provides a rough measure of the sensitivity of different \n\nspecies that can be used to rank them and identifying which ones have greater \n\nprobabilities of survival (ICES 2014). \n\n External injuries \n\nExternal damages were also registered for each individual based on simple descriptions \n\nof 4 types of injuries \u2013 scale loss, bruises, superficial wounds and deep wounds (scored \n\nas present, 1, when clearly observed and as absent 0, when not present or when was not \n\nobvious its occurrence; table 2.2). This assessment was applied separately from CVA \n\nbecause different species shown specific characteristics. For example, European conger, \n\nmonkfish and the sharks do not have scales. Presence of injuries has a direct \n\nrelationship with trauma and possible infections, and consequently mortality (ICES \n\n2014). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n\n \n\n2.1.2 Sampling design \n\nSampling was conducted in December 2016 (during six days) and February 2017 \n\n(five days duration) in a commercial fishing vessel along the south coast of Portugal, at \n\na minimum distance of 6 nautical miles off the coast (figure 2.2). Positional data \n\n(latitude and longitude), depth, fishing operation details and environmental information \n\n(air temperature, sea state and light level) were recorded for most of the forty hauls. \n\nWater temperature ranged between 17 \u00b0C and 18 \u00b0C and the sea was mostly at moderate \n\nstate, with waves reaching 1.3 meters. The temperature of the air varied from 17 \u00b0C to \n\n20 \u00b0C, with cloudy sky in half of the period. The trawl gear was towed for 4 hours (95% \n\nconfidence interval, or CI, of 3.6 to 5.2 hours), between 123 and 841 meters depth. \n\nAverage speed of towing was 2.9 to 3 knots (given by the skipper), and hauling took 20 \n\nminutes on average (95% CI from 16.4 to 23 minutes). The cod end was emptied into a \n\ncontainer below deck and in most hauls the net was re-deployed prior to catch sorting, \n\nwhich lasted around seven minutes. Total catch was roughly estimated to be 181 kg \n\n(95% CI from 155.1 to 208.1 kg) and the sorting process took on average 18 minutes \n\n(95% CI 15.6 to 20 minutes). Time 0 was defined as when the catch was dropped into \n\nthis container below deck. The crew sorted the catch by hand and samples were taken \n\nright after the sorting process started. \n\nFor practical reasons, random samples of 10 to 15 individuals were collected \n\nfrom each species, depending on the by-catch composition of the haul, for further \n\nmortality monitoring. Individuals were monitored for 2-3 seconds for vitality \n\nassessment (table 2.1) and injury evaluation (table 2.2), until there were no signs of life. \n\nImmobile individuals were manipulated and tested for reflexes responses in order to be \n\nsure of dead state (if at least one of the reflexes was present, the individual was \n\nconsidered still alive; table 2.3). At the end of the monitoring period, total body length \n\nwas measured and individuals of some species frozen for later observations of the type \n\nof gas bladder.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - Description of the codes used to score the vitality (Beno\u00eet et al. 2010) \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.2 - Description of the codes used to score the injuries (Catchpole et al. 2015) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1.3 - Description of the reflex responses tested (Catchpole et al. 2015) \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nVitality state Score Description \n\nExcellent 1 Vigorous body movement without stimuli \n\nGood 2 Weak body movement, but responds to touching \n\nPoor 3 No body movement, no obvious response to stimuli, but fish can \n\nmove operculum/mouth/fins \n\nDead/moribund 4 No body or opercular movements, no response to touching or \n\ngrabbing \n\nFish injury Description \nScale loss Visible area of scale loss \n\nBruises Red bruising visible on the body \n\nWounding Visible shallow cuts on the body \n\nDeep wounding Visible deep cuts on the body \n\nName Stimulus action Reflex response \n\nOperculum \n\nclosure \n\nThe operculum of the fish is \n\ngently opened with a blunt object \n\nAbility to tightly close/clamp its \n\noperculum after being opened within 5 \n\nseconds \n\nMouth closure The mouth of the fish is gently \n\nopened with a blunt object \n\nAbility to tightly close/clamp its mouth \n\nafter being opened within 5 seconds \n\nGag response A blunt object is inserted in the \n\nmouth of the fish and touch the \n\nthroat \n\nFish gagged/vomit \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n\n \n\nConcerning the biological traits, injuries and deciduous scales were scored as \n\npresent (1) or absent (0). Gas bladder was divided in three categories: no gas bladder, \n\nopen gas bladder or closed gas bladder. The metabolic rate was classified in three levels \n\n(low, medium and high metabolic rate), according to the range of values found for the \n\ngroup of taxa. \n\n \n\n2.1.3 Data analysis \n\nCVA and TTM \n\nImmediate mortality for each species was calculated, given by the number of \n\nindividuals that were classified as dying/dead state (state four of vitality assessment) at \n\nthe first minute of visual evaluation. Survival analysis was conducted using statistical R \n\nprogramming language ('survival package', R Development Core Team 2008) to model \n\nsurvival probability as a function of time, as a measure of fish tolerance to stress and air \n\nexposure.  \n\nSimple non-parametric Kaplan-Meier models were applied to estimate time to \n\n50% mortality (TTM), after data censoring (table 2.4). This median value and its \n\nconfidence intervals (CI) were defined by drawing a horizontal line at 0.5 on the plot of \n\nthe survival curve and its confidence bands. The intersection of this line with the lower \n\nCI band defined the lower limit for the median\u2019s interval, and similarly for the upper \n\nband (error bars represented in figure 3.3). Data censoring occurs when the exact time \n\nof an event, in this case time of mortality after capture and handling, is not known \n\n(Beno\u00eet et al. 2013).  Fish that were dead (score four on vitality assessment) when first \n\nobserved at time 0 (before monitoring period, time T) are treated as left-censored \n\nobservations in that their actual time of mortality occurred before time T. Fish that were \n\nstill alive when mortality monitoring ceases are considered right-censored observations \n\n(t > T); the remaining individuals (i.e. those that died during TTM monitoring) are \n\nconsidered as uncensored observations (t ? T). In addition, interval censoring was \n\napplied when mortality was known to occur between two times (a<T<b) but the exact \n\ntime of mortality was not registered. This type of censoring was used specifically to join \n\nthe TTM data for 12 species.  \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n\n \n\nAfter data censoring, from a group of 19 species, 7 were excluded from the \n\nfurther statistical analysis (table 2.4, species with *) due to small sample size (Citharus \n\nlinguatula, Lepidopus caudatus, Hoplostethus mediterraneus, Scomber spp.) or because \n\nthe individuals were taken just from one haul (Capros aper, Nezumia sclerorhynchus, \n\nSetarches guentheri). \n\nTable 2.4 \u2013 Results of censoring and further statistical analysis for each species. * represents \n\nspecies with small sample size or data coming from only one haul.

Positional data (latitude and longitude) and fishing depth \n\nwere recorded. Once the net was emptied to the container below deck and the catch \n\nstarted to be sorted, 20 to 30 individuals (C. conger) were collected from each haul (if \n\nthere are enough individuals) and placed in the tanks (first haul \u2013 tank 1; second haul \u2013 \n\ntank 2; figure 2.1). The fish were maintained on the tanks for up to 65 hours and \n\nmonitored every 4 to 6 hours to check for dead fish and remove them. Water \n\ntemperature in the tanks ranged between 13 \u00b0C and 18 \u00b0C using the on-board cooling \n\nsystem. It was not possible to have a continuous water flow, but the water in the tanks \n\nwas completely renewed every 3 hours. When first placed in water, the position and \n\nbehaviour of the fish was noted: if it floats or sinks (FL/SK) and if it tries to swim or not \n\n(SW: 1/0), within the first 5 seconds on water. The behaviour in water was also noted \n\nduring the monitoring period: immobile (IM) or swimming (SW) and on the bottom \n\n(BT) or in the water column (WC). Major injuries were assessed at the end of the \n\nexperiment \u2013 scratches, deep cuts, wounds or bruises (scored as presence/absence, 1/0). \n\nIn-water reflexes were observed to confirm the vitality/survival status and at the end of \n\nthe experiment (scored as 1, present if a response is clearly present or 0, absent if the \n\nresponse was not present or of weak or questionable strength; table 2.6).

In tank 1, 4 out of 36 total fish died during the monitoring period, \n\nmeaning a survival rate of 89% (95% CI: 78.6 to 99.2 %). In the second tank, 22 fish \n\nsurvived (total of 28 fish), which matches a survival proportion of 79% (95% CI: 63.4 \n\nto 93.8 %) at the end of the experiment (figure 3.10).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.10 \u2013 Kaplan-Meier survival curves for C. conger separate by tanks. Dashed lines \n\nrepresent 95% confidence intervals. \n\n \n\nMost mortality occurred in the first 14 hours: 8% in tank 1 (95% CI: 1 to 17.4%) \n\nand 18% in tank II (95% CI: 3.7 to 32%). However, the mortality rate did not reach an \n\nasymptote at the end of the observation period. \n\nWhen comparing survival results between the two tanks, there were no \n\nsignificant differences (p=0.218), so the data was grouped into one survival curve, \n\ncorresponding to an overall survival probability close to 84% (95% CI: 75.5 to 93.3%). \n\nAll fish started to swim immediately after being placed in water and 98% responded \n\npositively to the in-water reflexes tested. \n\nEvery individual had some sort of injury, from scratches in the surface of the \n\nskin to more severe ones, e.g. deep wounds in tail and fins (Annex - images 7.1 to 7.6). \n\nThe frequency of injuries is shown in figure 3.11, with almost 70% of C. conger \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n\n \n\n31 \n\n69 \n\n17 \n20 \n\n3 5 \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFew scratches Scratches Tail wound Fin wound Inflated belly Infected eyes\n\n%\n I\n\nn\nd\n\niv\nid\n\nu\na\n\nls\n \n\nexhibiting scratched skin, likely due to crowding inside the trawling net. Around 40% of \n\nthe fish had bruises on the tail and pectoral fins; 5% shown affected eyes, maybe due to \n\ninfection or result of abrasion; and 3% presented an inflated stomach, a probable sign of \n\nbarotrauma. Nevertheless, most of the fish appeared to be swimming calmly during the \n\nexperiment and were eating after 22h in water. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe number of injuries to each individual was included as a covariable in a \n\nWeibull model in order to see whether the presence of injuries influenced the observed \n\nmortality. Only individuals that presented 3 types of injuries had a significant and \n\nnegative effect on the results (value = -0.32; p-value =0.01; table 3.8); meaning that fish \n\nwith more injuries suffered higher mortality. As shown in figure 3.12, this can be \n\nconfirmed because the survival curves of individuals that presented zero, one and two \n\ninjuries (green, yellow and orange lines) are identical, but all the individuals that died \n\nduring the course of the monitoring period presented 3 types of injuries (red line). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.11 \u2013 Frequency of injuries shown as percentage (%) of individuals with each type \n\nof injury. \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.8 \u2013 Results of Weibull model for survival of C. conger - without covariates (base \n\nmodel) and model including number of injuries as possible explanatory variable. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.12 - Kaplan-Meier results for the effects of number of injuries (0, 1, 2, and 3 types of \n\ninjuries) on survival of C. conger. \n\n \n\n \n\nParameters/Models Base model p-value likelihood test \n\n Value Std p-value  \n\nIntercept 6.62 0.904 2.41e-13 ________________________ \n\nAIC (base model) 140.03 \n\n+ Number of injuries (1)    0.038 \n\n \n0 injuries 1.38 1.44 0.34 \n\n2 injuries 0.35 0.95 0.71 \n\n3 injuries -0.32 1.25 0.01 \n\nAIC 137.62 \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\n4. DISCUSSION \n\n  4.1 Study of by-catch species susceptibilities \n\nAs a preliminary survival assessment, this work provided estimates of immediate \n\nmortality and time-to-mortality (TTM) data for a wide range of species: C. conger, G. \n\nmelastomus, H. dactylopterus, L. boscii, Lophius spp. (L. budegassa and L. piscatorius), \n\nM. merluccius, M. poutassou, M. surmuletus, P. blennoides, S. canicula, Trigla lyra and \n\nTrachurus spp. (T. picturatus and T. trachurus). This enabled a preliminary evaluation \n\nof the vulnerability of these animals to the stressors associated with capture and \n\nexposure to air, from which some inferences can be made on their potential to survive \n\nthe discarding process.  \n\nTime to 50% mortality (50% TTM), immediate mortality (%) and the Kaplan-\n\nMeier survival probability curves identify M. poutassou, P. blennoides, L. boscii, T. \n\nlyra, M. merluccius, M. surmuletus, Trachurus spp. and H. dactylopterus as highly \n\nsusceptible to air exposure; with 50% TTMs of less than 30 minutes, and in most cases \n\nless than 20 minutes. However, S. canicula and C. conger appear to be relatively \n\nresistant with 50% TTMs in excess of 100 minutes.  \n\nAlmost all species were observed with some form of external injuries, mostly \n\nscale loss, bruises and shallow wounds. In particular, M. merluccius, P. blennoides, T. \n\nlyra, N. sclerorhynchus and S. guentheri often exhibited evidence of barotrauma, in the \n\nform of everted stomach, inflated abdomen or popped eyes (personal observations). For \n\nthis species, survival after discarding is virtually impossible.  \n\nBased on the Kaplan-Meier and Weibull models, vitality at first \n\nobservation is a very limited predictor of time-to-mortality. Species specific behavioural \n\ntraits need to be considered when interpreting the results. Two major inconsistencies \n\nwere identified: the absence of vitality states 1 and 2; and species with high vitality \n\nscores but low time-to-mortality. Lophius spp., C. conger, S. canicula and G. \n\nmelastomus are sedentary, benthic species with body musculature and skeletons adapted \n\nfor energy saving mechanisms (Helfman et al. 2009). When subjected to extreme stress \n\nconditions such as air exposure, these species reduce activity to a minimum in order to \n\nconserve energy. Consequently, vitality states 1 and 2 were never observed. The same \n\nwas the case of L. boscii, M. merluccius, T. lyra, M. poutassou and P. blennoides. These \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n\n \n\nspecies suffer decompression effects, injuries or/and immense extenuation which leads \n\nto a state of most individuals dying or arriving dead on deck (vitality state 3 &amp; 4). In \n\ncontrast, Trachurus spp., M. surmuletus and Scomber spp. display signs of intense \n\nactivity and occasionally shivering movements when brought on deck; in accordance \n\nwith the vitality scale, this response is \u201cpositive\u201d and classified with high vitality scores \n\nfor these species. But in reality, these signs seem to be an advanced stress-response. \n\nWhen placed in water, these individuals are disorientated, not able to hold position in \n\nthe water column and/or unable to swim (personal observations). These observations are \n\nconfirmed by the substantially reduced TTM. Behavioural disturbances such as loss of \n\nequilibrium have been related with different stressors, one being air exposure \n\n(Gingerich et al. 2007; Davis 2005). \n\nTherefore, two separate vitality scales are proposed (tables 4.1 and 4.2) to \n\ndistinguish the behaviour categories for benthic/sedentary species and bathypelagic, fast \n\nswimming fish. For sedentary species, a combined methodology of vitality together \n\nwith testing reflex actions evaluates more adequately the overall state of the animal. In \n\nparticular, the absence of a clear transition from alive to dead requires adaptions in the \n\nvisual assessments. The solution is the use of innate or reflex responses to precisely \n\nstimulate, for example, the gag response or opening the operculum. Reflex actions are \n\ninnate fixed movement patterns that are directly related to vitality, without being \n\nconfounded by other factors. The vitality scale for bathypelagic and pelagic species \n\nstays identical but should be complemented if possible with testing reflex actions in-\n\nwater, recorded as presence (1) or absence (0) of the reflex response. \n\n \n\n \n\nVitality state Score Description \n\nExcellent 1 Vigorous body movement without \n\nstimuli \n\nGood 2 Weak body movement, but responds to \n\ntouching \n\nPoor 3 No body movement, no obvious \n\nresponse to stimuli, but fish can move \n\noperculum/mouth/fins \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Proposed vitality scale with description of the codes for bathypelagic and pelagic \n\nspecies (based on ICES 2014 and Catchpole et al. 2015) \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n\n \n\nDead 4 No body or opercular movements, no \n\nresponse to touching or grabbing \n\n   \n\nReflex actions in-\n\nwater \n\nStimulus action Reflex response \n\nStartle touch Fish is underwater and hand \n\napproaches to touch fish \n\nActively moves away before or at first \n\ntouch \n\nTail grab Fish is grabbed gently by its \n\ntail \n\nActively struggles to escape within 5 \n\nseconds \n\nOrientation/Righting Fish is held on the palm of \n\nthe hand on its back just \n\nbelow the water surface and \n\nreleased \n\nActively righting itself underwater \n\nwithin 5 seconds \n\n \n\n \n\nVitality state Score Description \n\nGood 1 Some spontaneous body movements, responds to all reflex \n\nactions \n\nPoor 2 No spontaneous body movements, responds to at least one reflex \n\naction \n\nMoribund/Dead 3 No body movement, no response to any reflex action \n\n \n\nReflex actions Stimulus action/ \n\nDescription of response \n\nOperculum \n\nclosure \n\nThe operculum of the fish is gently opened with a blunt object/Ability to \n\nclose or clamp its operculum after being opened within 5 seconds. \n\nMouth closure The mouth of the fish is gently opened with a blunt object/Ability to tightly \n\nclose its mouth after being opened within 5 seconds. \n\nGag response A blunt object is inserted in the mouth of the fish and touch the throat/Fish \n\ngagged or vomit. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.2 \u2013 Proposed vitality scale with description of the codes for benthic/sedentary species \n\n(based on ICES 2014 and Catchpole et al. 2015) \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nBody size was a significant explanatory variable for S. canicula and C. conger \n\nwhich endure long periods of air exposure. Smaller fish have a higher rate of mortality, \n\nexplained by their increased susceptibility to injuries in the net and higher respiration \n\ndemands (Beno\u00eet et al. 2013). However, for species with high susceptibility to air \n\nexposure and consequent low TTM, such as Trachurus spp. and H. dactylopterus, body \n\nsize seems to be less relevant.   \n\nConcerning the analysis of biological traits, there were particular traits that had a \n\nsignificant influence on TTM. Species with a closed gas bladder died at a faster rate \n\ncompared to individuals without a gas bladder. Fish with a closed gas bladder cannot \n\nresist depressurization effects when brought to surface. Hauling occurs at such high \n\nspeeds (~20 meters per minute) causing over-inflation or a rupture of the swim bladder,  \n\nand consequently release of gas into the body cavity and eversion of stomach and gut \n\n(ICES 2014; Nichol &amp; Chilton 2006; Rummer &amp; Bennett 2005; Breen 2004).  \n\nThere were no differences in TTM for species with open and no gas bladder, \n\nmainly due to C. conger possessing an open gas bladder but at the same time \n\nrepresenting one of the most resistant species to air-exposure. For the group of 12 \n\nspecies (M. poutassou, P. blennoides, L. boscii, T. lyra, M. merluccius, M. surmuletus, \n\nTrachurus spp., H. dactylopterus, G. melastomus, Lophius spp., S. canicula, C. conger), \n\npresence of scales and medium/high metabolic rates significantly decreased time-to-\n\nmortality. Fish with deciduous scales are more vulnerable to water losses due to scale \n\nloss and consequent collapse of the osmoregulatory functions of the skin, resulting in \n\nincreased sensitivity to hypoxia (ICES 2014; Breen 2004). These outcomes are in line \n\nwith Beno\u00eet et al. (2013), where mass-specific respiration demand, physoclistous and \n\nphysostomous bladders and deciduous scales all had significant and negative effects on \n\nsurvival. They identified as well that sedentariness, defined as a species\u2019 average \n\nactivity level that relates to its overall resistance to stress, was the most influential trait \n\non TTM. In this work, metabolic-rate-class can be considered comparable to \n\nsedentariness, and indeed has a pronounced effect on how different fish species cope \n\nwith the stressors related with hypoxia. Energy conserving behaviour of low metabolic \n\nrates, characteristic of species such as Lophius and S. canicula, is translated into greater \n\ntime-to-mortality results when compared with species with fast metabolism and high \n\nsusceptibility to air exposure (M. surmuletus, M. poutassou). When injuries are included \n\nin the analysis, contradicting results show up of a non-significant but positive result \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n(value = 0.225; p-value > 0.01), meaning injured animals survive longer than healthy \n\nindividuals. This bias may be due to anomalies in the unbalanced sample distribution of \n\nonly 40 individuals without injuries against 367 with injuries. \n\nIt is important to identify species\u2019 characteristics that can explain the observed \n\nmortality rates. A biological traits analysis (BTA) of by-catch and target species was \n\nperformed as an assessment of species vulnerability, also taking into account the \n\ndiversity of life strategies (Demestre et al. 2017). Vulnerability was assessed into three \n\ncomponents: catchability or susceptibility to be caught; resistance or potential survival \n\non-board; and resilience of a population to fishing. This method provided a final score \n\nthat reflected susceptibility at an individual, species and population level to the fishing \n\noperations. Most by-catch fish species were highly vulnerable, mainly attributable to \n\nhigh catchability together with low to moderate resistance. However, most of these \n\nspecies were at the same time considered highly resilient to fishing, explained by \n\nlong/average life span, annual reproduction and age at maturity lower than 5 years. \n\nScyliorhinus canicula was the only species considered less vulnerable when compared \n\nwith the others (moderately vulnerable category).  \n\nThe results of this BTA match the ones from the current work, that is the \n\nmajority of by-catch fish species are fragile and do not resist the overload of stressors \n\ncoming from the capture, handling and the discarding process. Only crustacean, \n\nbivalves, echinoderm and occasionally elasmobranch species are likely to survive but \n\nthese also represent a low percentage of discarded weight (Hill &amp; Wassenberg 2000; \n\nDepestele et al. 2014; Monteiro et al. 2001). The most likely fate is being eaten by \n\nmarine birds or other predators in the water column or by bottom scavengers if the \n\nanimals sink (Hill &amp; Wassenberg 2000; Castro et al 2005). Complementary studies are \n\nstill needed to accurately predict post-release survival of discards, since these methods \n\nare restricted to the specific stressors observed in hypoxia conditions and cannot be \n\ninferred for a range of stressors associated with the whole fishery (ICES 2014). \n\nNevertheless, these indicators are certainly useful to calculate immediate mortality for a \n\nlarge number of species, in an easy and simple manner, providing valuable information \n\nof real fishing conditions with little costs. In addition, biological traits and other \n\nexplanatory variables can be addressed in determining to which extent can influence \n\nmortality of these species.  \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n\n \n\n4.2 Potential for survival of by-catch \u2013 an experimental trial \n\nAs a result of the first part of this work, Conger conger emerged as one of the \n\nspecies with a high likelihood of survival. A specific on-board experiment was \n\nconducted to investigate the survival potential of this species. 84 % (95% CI: 75.5 to \n\n93.3%) of individuals survived the observation period of 65 hours. It is a rather high \n\nsurvival rate, taking into account that these fish had been exposed to extreme stressors \n\nassociated with capture by a heavy chain gear, compression in the codend of the net and \n\npossible effects of vessel motion while on tanks. In fact, individuals started to feed on \n\ncrustaceans after 22 hours on the system.  \n\nThe experimental conditions between the two tanks were not exactly the same. \n\nThe water temperature in tank II was slightly higher (2 to 4 \u00b0C higher) than in tank I; \n\nand the two tanks had different capacity and were made of different materials (tank 1 \n\nmade of metal, tank 2 made of plastic). Nevertheless, these differences had no \n\nsignificant effect on the survival curves, so the two tanks were treated as replicates and \n\nthe survival estimate grouped from both.  \n\nThere are no reference studies on survival of C. conger. In the Northwest \n\nMediterranean similar experiments were conducted with C. conger and S. canicula \n\n(Demestre et al. 1998). After three days in tanks, C. conger had 75% survival, but due \n\nto small sample size (3 individuals) no further conclusions could be reached. For S. \n\ncanicula, all 11 individuals survived the experiment. However, mortality did not \n\nstabilize during the observation period and individuals kept dying. Also, dissections \n\nshowed multiple internal traumas (personal observation from Demestre et al. 1998).  On \n\nthe other hand, recent studies show that S. canicula was able to fully recover after 48 \n\nhours, with a survival rate of around 98% (95% CI: 96 to 100%; Revill et al. 2005) and \n\n78% (95% CI: 47.1 to 90.5%; Rodriguez-Cabello et al. 2005).  \n\nIt is questionable that conger will show a similar survival success. All \n\nindividuals in this work exhibited some form of injury, including severe wounds and \n\nscratches, bruises on skin and fins, inflated stomach and affected eyes (figures 7.1 \u2013 7.6 \n\nin Annex). In fact, individuals that presented more types of injuries had higher \n\nmortality. Impaired fish have reduced ability to avoid predation and are more \n\nsusceptible to physiological disturbances or disease, thus the survival rate calculated \n\nhere is likely to be over-estimated (Davis 2002; Davis 2010; Davis &amp; Ottmar 2006; \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n\n \n\nBreen 2004). As in the study by Demestre et al. (1998), the monitoring time of this \n\nexperiment was not enough for the mortality rate to stabilize; meaning that if the study \n\nhad been longer, more congers would probably die. Ideally, captive observation studies \n\nshould terminate only once the mortality of held fish becomes constant, but this can take \n\nup to several weeks (Depestele et al. 2014), which in this case was not practical due to \n\nlogistic limitations of working on board the vessel.  \n\nAnother methodological concern is the absence of control fish. When survival is \n\nless than 100%, control individuals can help to distinguish whether it was the treatment \n\n(having gone through the capture and handling process) or the method (having been \n\ncontained in tanks) which was associated to the observed mortality (ICES 2014). \n\nHowever, in this study it was not possible to have control individuals of C. conger \n\ncaught with other fishing gears mainly due to financial constraints. There are always \n\nstressors associated with capturing fish that might induce mortality, even if static gears \n\nare used (e.g. traps), so proper controls are quite difficult to arrange, especially in such \n\ndeep waters. Moreover, it is plausible to assume that in this experiment the effects of \n\ncapturing and handling are much more relevant to the observed mortality than any \n\nstressor related with holding the fish in tanks.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\nOverall, the categorical vitality assessment used in this study does not seem to \n\nbe a good predictor of time-to-mortality. Adjustments in this methodology to account \n\nfor differences in behaviour between species should be considered in future work, as \n\nsuggested previously.  \n\n It can be concluded that M. poutassou, P. blennoides, L. boscii, T. lyra, M. \n\nmerluccius, M. surmuletus, Trachurus spp. (T. trachurus and T. picturatus) and H. \n\ndactylopterus are all vulnerable to the stressors associated with capture in this bottom \n\ntrawl fishery, as well as exposure to air on deck. G. melastomus and Lophius spp. (L. \n\npiscatorius and L. budegassa) seem more resistant, but the only species that \n\ndemonstrated resilience to these stressors were S. canicula and C. conger.  \n\nSmaller individuals in this study appear to be more susceptible than larger ones. \n\nSpecific biological traits such as open gas bladder, presence of scales and high \n\nmetabolic rates also increase a species\u2019 vulnerability. This allows inferences on \n\nprobable mortality of not yet examined species; although, only for the same gear in \n\nidentical fishing conditions. Since there is a large number of interacting variables of \n\nvarious types (environmental, technical, biological) that influence by-catch mortality, \n\nthe implications of the results of this study are limited by the experimental factors taken \n\ninto account (ICES 2014). \n\nRegarding the survival experiment, C. conger had high survival (84%; 95% CI: \n\n75.5 to 93.3%) but likely overestimated due to the fact that the mortality rate did not \n\nstabilize by the end of the observation period and also severe injuries were present in \n\nalmost 70% of the individuals. For additional investigation of survival potential, inland \n\ntank trials are recommended in order to conduct a longer study, preferably using control \n\nfish. Analysis of cortisol, glucose and ions (Na\n+\n, Cl\n\n-\n and K\n\n+\n) from blood sampling can \n\nprovide a method to study stress levels of fish in captivity (Mar\u00e7alo et al. 2008) . Also, \n\nmark-and-recapture studies using tags can be applied, considering that the proportion of \n\ntag returns is often minimal (ICES 2014). Every method has its advantages and \n\ndrawbacks. The chosen methods for this work limited the conclusions that can be made, \n\nbut also implied a cost-effective approach of having a large amount of new information \n\nthat can be used as starting point for future projects.  \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n\n \n\nBottom trawling results in a large proportion of dead discards that are consumed \n\nimmediately or sink. In this case study, 5% of total discards might survive, constituted \n\nby S. canicula and C. conger and without considering other phyla (e.g. molluscs or \n\ntunicates). The primary solution to reduce discard mortality is avoiding catching \n\nunwanted species in the first place; a difficult task considering that many discarded \n\nspecies are frequently retained due to their high market value (e.g. hake and monkfish). \n\nBoth mesh configurations and sorting grids to improve trawl selectivity resulted in a \n\nslight decrease of crustacean catches and therefore never were implemented (Fonseca et \n\nal. 2004; Campos et al. 2003). More promising are minor changes to the procedures, \n\nsuch as reducing trawls duration and handling the catch with urgency and care, \n\nminimizing injuries and exposure to air (Breen et al. 2017). However, considering the \n\nextensive physical disruption of deep-sea habitats and the little post-discard survival in \n\nthis particular fishery, alternative gears should be considered. Low-impact, no-discard \n\ngears can substitute crustacean demersal trawling (e.g. traps, creels), besides being a \n\nmore economically viable fishery with reduced costs and fuel consumption (Leoc\u00e1dio et \n\nal. 2012). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\n6.
