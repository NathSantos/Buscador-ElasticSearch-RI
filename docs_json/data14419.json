Mas esta tend\u00eancia de miniaturiza\u00e7\u00e3o \nda eletr\u00f3nica desafia consideravelmente os processos de fabrico, os materiais a \nserem utilizados nas montagens das placas e a fiabilidade, entre outros aspetos. \nDispositivos semicondutores e tecnologia de circuitos integrados, juntamente com \na embalagem eletr\u00f3nica associada, constituem a espinha dorsal dos sistemas \neletr\u00f3nicos miniaturizados de alto desempenho. No entanto, \u00e0 medida que o \ntamanho diminui e a funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o aumenta, a redu\u00e7\u00e3o das dimens\u00f5es destes \ndipositivos \u00e9 cada vez mais dif\u00edcil; \u00e9 bem conhecido que abaixo de um tamanho \nlimite o desempenho do dispositivo deteriora-se. Assim, a miniaturiza\u00e7\u00e3o da \neletr\u00f3nica \u00e0 base de sil\u00edcio tem limita\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\n\u00c9 precisamente neste contexto que desde 2011 o Road Map for Semiconductor \nIndustry (ITRS) sugere tecnologias alternativas \u00e0s atualmente em uso, designadas \npor Mais de Moore (More than Moore); sendo uma delas com base em carbono \n(CNTs e grafeno) [1]. \n\nOs CNTs com o seu desempenho \u00fanico e tridimensionalidade \u00e0 escala \nnanom\u00e9trica, foram considerados como elementos muito promissores para a \neletr\u00f3nica miniaturizada [2]. Nanotubos de carbono possuem uma geometria \ntubular e um conjunto \u00fanico de propriedades, incluindo o transporte bal\u00edstico de \neletr\u00f5es e uma capacidade enorme de transportar a corrente el\u00e9trica, o que os \ntornou de grande interesse para o futuro da microeletr\u00f3nica [2]. Na verdade, os \nCNTs podem ter um papel fundamental na miniaturiza\u00e7\u00e3o das mem\u00f3rias \nferroel\u00e9tricas n\u00e3o vol\u00e1teis (NV-FeRAM). A mudan\u00e7a de uma constru\u00e7\u00e3o \ntradicional bidimensional (2D) (ou seja, a duas dimens\u00f5es, como s\u00e3o os filmes \nfinos) para uma constru\u00e7\u00e3o tridimensional 3D, com base num arranjo \ntridimensional de estruturas unidimensionais (1D), como s\u00e3o as estruturas \nnanotubulares, resultar\u00e1 num desempenho melhorado com dete\u00e7\u00e3o de sinal \nel\u00e9trico optimizada, devido \u00e0 grande contribui\u00e7\u00e3o do el\u00e9trodo inferior. Uma \nmaneira de conseguir esta configura\u00e7\u00e3o 3D \u00e9 usando nanotubos de carbono. \n\nOs materiais ferroel\u00e9tricos (FE) s\u00e3o polarizados espontaneamente e possuem \nconstantes diel\u00e9tricas altas e as suas propriedades piroel\u00e9tricas, piezoel\u00e9tricas e \neletro\u00f3pticas tornam-nos materiais funcionais importantes na eletr\u00f3nica, sendo \numa das suas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es chave em mem\u00f3rias eletr\u00f3nicas. \n\nNo entanto, combinar os nanotubos de carbono com \u00f3xidos FE funcionais \u00e9 um \ndesafio. Come\u00e7a logo com a compatibilidade entre os materiais e o seu \nprocessamento, j\u00e1 que as temperaturas de cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do FE e as temperaturas \nde oxida\u00e7\u00e3o dos CNTs se sobrep\u00f5em. Neste caso, o processamento a baixa \ntemperatura dos \u00f3xidos FE \u00e9 absolutamente fundamental. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDentro deste contexto, neste trabalho foi realizado um estudo sistem\u00e1tico sobre a \nfabrica\u00e7\u00e3o e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o estruturas combinadas de CNTs \u2013 FE, usando \nm\u00e9todos de baixa temperatura e de baixo custo. Os FE em estudo foram \ncompostos de titanato zirconato de chumbo (Pb1-xZrxTiO3, PZT), titanato de b\u00e1rio \n(BaTiO3, BT) e ferrite de bismuto (BiFeO3, BFO). Os diversos aspetos relacionados \ncom a s\u00edntese e fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o, como efeito sobre a estabilidade t\u00e9rmica dos \nnanotubos de carbono multiparede (multiwall CNTs, MWCNTs), forma\u00e7\u00e3o da fase \nFE na presen\u00e7a de MWCNTs e interfaces entre CNTs / FE foram abordados neste \ntrabalho. A resposta ferroel\u00e9trica medida localmente atrav\u00e9s de microscopia de \nponta de prova piezoel\u00e9trica (Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM)), evidenciou \nclaramente que, mesmo para baixas temperaturas de processamento \u00f3xidos FE \nsobre CNTs mant\u00e9m a sua natureza ferroel\u00e9trica. \n\nO trabalho come\u00e7ou pela identifica\u00e7\u00e3o do comportamento de decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o \nt\u00e9rmica em diferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es dos nanotubos utilizados neste trabalho. \nVerificou-se que os MWCNTs purificados s\u00e3o est\u00e1veis at\u00e9 420 \u00baC no ar, j\u00e1 que n\u00e3o \nocorre perda de peso sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o isot\u00e9rmicas, mas foram observadas, por \nespectroscopia Raman e microscopia eletr\u00f3nica de transmiss\u00e3o (TEM), altera\u00e7\u00f5es \nna morfologia dos tubos para condi\u00e7\u00f5es isot\u00e9rmicas a 400 \u00baC. Em atmosfera rica \nem oxig\u00e9nio os MWCNTs come\u00e7am a oxidar-se a 200 \u00baC. No entanto, em \natmosfera rica em \u00e1rgon e sob uma taxa de aquecimento elevada os MWCNTs \npermanecem est\u00e1veis at\u00e9 1300 \u00baC com uma sublima\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00ednima. A energia de \nativa\u00e7\u00e3o para a decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o destes MWCNTs em ar foi calculada situar-se entre \n80 e 108 kJ / mol. \n\nEstes resultados s\u00e3o relevantes para a fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas MWCNTs - FE. \nDe facto, demonstramos que o PZT pode ser depositado por sol-gel a baixas \ntemperaturas sobre MWCNTs. E, particularmente interessante foi provar que a \npresen\u00e7a de MWCNTs diminui a temperatura e tempo para a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de PZT, \nem cerca de ~ 100 \u00baC comensur\u00e1veis com uma diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na energia de ativa\u00e7\u00e3o \nde 68 \u00b1 15 kJ / mol a 27 \u00b1 2 kJ / mol. Como consequ\u00eancia, foi obtido PZT \nmonof\u00e1sico a 575 \u00baC para as estruturas MWCNTs \u2013 PZT, enquanto que para PZT \n(na aus\u00eancia de MWCNTs) a presen\u00e7a da fase de pirocloro era ainda not\u00f3ria a 650 \n\u00baC e onde a fase de PZT foi formada por nuclea\u00e7\u00e3o homog\u00e9nea. A natureza \npiezoel\u00e9trica das estruturas de MWCNTs - PZT sintetizadas a 500 \u00baC por 1 h foi \nprovada por PFM. \n\nNa continua\u00e7\u00e3o deste trabalho foi desenvolvida uma metodologia de baixo custo \npara revestimento de MWCNTs usando uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o entre o processamento \nsol \u2013 gel e o processamento hidrotermal. Neste caso o FE usado como prova de \nconceito foi o BT. BT \u00e9 uma perovesquita sem chumbo bem conhecida e utilizada \nem muitas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es microeletr\u00f3nicas. No entanto, a s\u00edntese por rea\u00e7\u00e3o no estado \ns\u00f3lido \u00e9 normalmente realizada entre 1100 - 1300 \u00baC o que coloca seriamente em \nrisco a combina\u00e7\u00e3o com MWCNTs. Neste \u00e2mbito, tamb\u00e9m se ilustrou claramente \na inefic\u00e1cia da s\u00edntese hidrot\u00e9rmica convencional, devido \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o de \ncarbonatos, nomeadamente BaCO3. As estruturas MWCNTs - BT aqui preparadas \ns\u00e3o ferroel\u00e9tricas e exibem resposta electromec\u00e2nica (15 pm / V). Considera-se \nque estes resultados t\u00eam impacto elevado, uma vez que esta estrat\u00e9gia tamb\u00e9m \npode ser estendida a outros compostos de materiais com elevadas temperaturas \nde cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Al\u00e9m disso, foi tamb\u00e9m verificado no decurso deste trabalho que \na cobertura de MWCNTs com FE pode ser optimizada, neste caso com \nfuncionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o covalente dos tubos, ou seja, por exemplo com sodium \ndodecyl sulfate (SDS). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAinda no decurso deste trabalho, os MWCNTs foram utilizados como modelos / \nandaimes (templates) para crescer, neste caso, nanorods de multiferroicos de \nBFO. Mostrou-se que o uso de solventes n\u00edtricos promove danos severos nas \nparedes dos MWCNTs, o que resulta na oxida\u00e7\u00e3o prematura dos tubos durante o \ntratamento de recozimento. Observou-se tamb\u00e9m que a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de solventes \nn\u00edtricos resulta no enchimento parcial dos MWCNTs com BFO, devido \u00e0 baixa \ntens\u00e3o superficial (<119 mN / m) da solu\u00e7\u00e3o de nitrato. A abertura dos topos dos \ntubos e o enchimento dos tubos ocorre simultaneamente durante a etapa de \nrefluxo. Verificou-se ainda que os MWCNTs tem um papel cr\u00edtico na fabrica\u00e7\u00e3o de \nBFO monof\u00e1sico; isto \u00e9, a oxida\u00e7\u00e3o de nanotubos de carbono durante o processo \nde recozimento faz com que a atmosfera deficiente em oxig\u00e9nio, que \u00e9 gerada \ncomo consequ\u00eancia, restrinja a forma\u00e7\u00e3o das fases secund\u00e1rias de Bi2O3 e se \npossa obter BFO monof\u00e1sico. A morfologia das nano estruturas de BFO obtidas \nindica que os MWCNTs podem atuar como molde ou andaime (template) para \ncrescer estruturas 1D de BFO. Medidas magn\u00e9ticas nestas nano estruturas \nrevelam uma curva de histerese ferromagn\u00e9tica pouco desenvolvida com um \ncampo coercivo de 956 Oe a 5 K. \n\nTamb\u00e9m se explorou o poss\u00edvel uso de CNTs alinhados verticalmente (VA-\nMWCNTs) como el\u00e9trodos de base para dispositivos de microeletr\u00f3nica, por \nexemplo, para aplica\u00e7\u00f5es de mem\u00f3ria. Como prova de conceito foram depositados \nin-situ filmes de BFO na superf\u00edcie dos VA-MWCNTs por pulveriza\u00e7\u00e3o cat\u00f3dica por \nr\u00e1dio frequ\u00eancia (rf sputtering). Para uma temperatura de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de 400 \u00baC e \ntempo de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de at\u00e9 2 h, filmes de BFO cobriram os VA-MWCNTs e n\u00e3o \nocorreram danos tanto no filme como nos MWCNTs. Apesar do comportamento \nmacrosc\u00f3pico destes filmes de BFO sobre VA-MWCNTs apresentar perdas \ndiel\u00e9ctricas, a natureza ferroel\u00e9ctrica, estrutura de dom\u00ednios e sua invers\u00e3o foi \nconfirmada por PFM. Uma histerese ferromagn\u00e9tica pouco desenvolvida com um \ncampo coercivo 700 Oe, caracterizam o comportamento magn\u00e9tico destas \nestruturas.  \n\nO nosso trabalho sistem\u00e1tico \u00e9 um passo significativo para o  desenvolvimento de \n\nc\u00e9lulas de mem\u00f3ria 3D; foi assim claramente demonstrado que os nanotubos de \n\ncarbono podem ser combinados com \u00f3xidos FE, para serem por exemplo usados \n\nna pr\u00f3xima gera\u00e7\u00e3o 3D de mem\u00f3rias ferroel\u00e9tricas n\u00e3o vol\u00e1teis, n\u00e3o excluindo, \n\nno entanto, outras potenciais aplica\u00e7\u00f5es na eletr\u00f3nica. \n  \n\n\n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nKeywords \n \n\n \n\nFerroelectric (FE) Materials, Chemical Solution Methods (CSD), Multiwall Carbon \nTubes (MWCNTs), Microelectronics, Electrical Properties, Electron Microscope, \nAtomic and Piezo Force Microscopy  \n\nAbstract \n\n \n \n \n\nThis work is about the combination of functional ferroelectric oxides with Multiwall \nCarbon Nanotubes for microelectronic applications, as for example potential 3 \nDimensional (3D) Non Volatile Ferroelectric Random Access Memories (NV-\nFeRAM). \n\nMiniaturized electronics are ubiquitous now. \n\nThe drive to downsize electronics has been spurred by needs of more performance \ninto smaller packages at lower costs. But the trend of electronics miniaturization \nchallenges board assembly materials, processes, and reliability. Semiconductor \ndevice and integrated circuit technology, coupled with its associated electronic \npackaging, forms the backbone of high-performance miniaturized electronic \nsystems. However, as size decreases and functionalization increases in the modern \nelectronics further size reduction is getting difficult; below a size limit the signal \nreliability and device performance deteriorate. Hence miniaturization of silicon-\nbased electronics has limitations. \n\nOn this background the Road Map for Semiconductor Industry (ITRS) suggests \nsince 2011 alternative technologies, designated as More than Moore; being one of \nthem based on carbon (carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene) [1]. \n\nCNTs with their unique performance and three dimensionality at the nano-scale \nhave been regarded as promising elements for miniaturized electronics [2]. CNTs \nare tubular in geometry and possess a unique set of properties, including ballistic \nelectron transportation and a huge current caring capacity, which make them of \ngreat interest for future microelectronics [2]. Indeed CNTs might have a key role in \nthe miniaturization of Non Volatile Ferroelectric Random Access Memories (NV-\nFeRAM). Moving from a traditional two dimensional (2D) design (as is the case of \nthin films) to a 3D structure (based on a tridimensional arrangement of \nunidimensional structures) will result in the high reliability and sensing of the signals \ndue to the large contribution from the bottom electrode. One way to achieve this 3D \ndesign is by using CNTs. \n\nFerroelectrics (FE) are spontaneously polarized and can have high dielectric \nconstants and interesting pyroelectric, piezoelectric, and electrooptic properties, \nbeing a key application of FE electronic memories. \n\nHowever, combining CNTs with FE functional oxides is challenging. It starts with \nmaterials compatibility, since crystallization temperature of FE and oxidation \ntemperature of CNTs may overlap. In this case low temperature processing of FE \nis fundamental. \n\nWithin this context in this work a systematic study on the fabrication of CNTs - FE \nstructures using low cost low temperature methods was carried out. The FE under \nstudy are comprised of lead zirconate titanate (Pb1-xZrxTiO3, PZT), barium titanate \n(BaTiO3, BT) and bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3, BFO). The various aspects related to the \nfabrication, such as effect on thermal stability of MWCNTs, FE phase formation in \npresence of MWCNTs and interfaces between the CNTs/FE are addressed in this \nwork.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n The ferroelectric response locally measured by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy \n(PFM) clearly evidenced that even at low processing temperatures FE on CNTs \nretain its ferroelectric nature. \n\nThe work started by verifying the thermal decomposition behavior under different \nconditions of the multiwall CNTs (MWCNTs) used in this work. It was verified that \npurified MWCNTs are stable up to 420 \u00baC in air, as no weight loss occurs under non \nisothermal conditions, but morphology changes were observed for isothermal \nconditions at 400 \u00baC by Raman spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy \n(TEM). In oxygen-rich atmosphere MWCNTs started to oxidized at 200 \u00baC. However \nin argon-rich one and under a high heating rate MWCNTs remain stable up to 1300 \n\u00baC with a minimum sublimation. The activation energy for the decomposition of \nMWCNTs in air was calculated to lie between 80 and 108 kJ/mol.  \n\nThese results are relevant for the fabrication of MWCNTs \u2013 FE structures. Indeed \nwe demonstrate that PZT can be deposited by sol gel at low temperatures on \nMWCNTs. And particularly interesting we prove that MWCNTs decrease the \ntemperature and time for formation of PZT by ~100 \u00baC commensurate with a \ndecrease in activation energy from 68\u00b115 kJ/mol to 27\u00b12 kJ/mol. As a consequence, \nmonophasic PZT was obtained at 575 \u00baC for MWCNTs - PZT whereas for pure PZT \ntraces of pyrochlore were still present at 650 \u00baC, where PZT phase formed due to \nhomogeneous nucleation. The piezoelectric nature of MWCNTs - PZT synthesised \nat 500 \u00baC for 1 h was proved by PFM. \n\nIn the continuation of this work we developed a low cost methodology of coating \nMWCNTs using a hybrid sol-gel / hydrothermal method. In this case the FE used as \na proof of concept was BT. BT is a well-known lead free perovskite used in many \nmicroelectronic applications. However, synthesis by solid state reaction is typically \nperformed around 1100 to 1300 \u00baC what jeopardizes the combination with MWCNTs. \nWe also illustrate the ineffectiveness of conventional hydrothermal synthesis in this \nprocess due the formation of carbonates, namely BaCO3. The grown MWCNTs - BT \nstructures are ferroelectric and exhibit an electromechanical response (15 pm/V). \nThese results have broad implications since this strategy can also be extended to \nother compounds of materials with high crystallization temperatures. In addition the \ncoverage of MWCNTs with FE can be optimized, in this case with non covalent \nfunctionalization of the tubes, namely with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). \n\nMWCNTs were used as templates to grow, in this case single phase multiferroic \nBFO nanorods. This work shows that the use of nitric solvent results in severe \ndamages of the MWCNTs layers that results in the early oxidation of the tubes during \nthe annealing treatment. It was also observed that the use of nitric solvent results in \nthe partial filling of MWCNTs with BFO due to the low surface tension (<119 mN/m) \nof the nitric solution. The opening of the caps and filling of the tubes occurs \nsimultaneously during the refluxing step. Furthermore we verified that MWCNTs \nhave a critical role in the fabrication of monophasic BFO; i.e. the oxidation of CNTs \nduring the annealing process causes an oxygen deficient atmosphere that restrains \nthe formation of Bi2O3 and monophasic BFO can be obtained. The morphology of \nthe obtained BFO nano structures indicates that MWCNTs act as template to grow \n1D structure of BFO. Magnetic measurements on these BFO nanostructures \nrevealed a week ferromagnetic hysteresis loop with a coercive field of 956 Oe at 5 \nK. \n\n \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWe also exploited the possible use of vertically-aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes \n(VA-MWCNTs) as bottom electrodes for microelectronics, for example for memory \napplications. As a proof of concept BiFeO3 (BFO) films were in-situ deposited on \nthe surface of VA-MWCNTs by RF (Radio Frequency) magnetron sputtering. For in \nsitu deposition temperature of 400 \u00baC and deposition time up to 2 h, BFO films cover \nthe VA-MWCNTs and no damage occurs either in the film or MWCNTs. In spite of \nthe macroscopic lossy polarization behaviour, the ferroelectric nature, domain \nstructure and switching of these conformal BFO films was verified by PFM. A week \nferromagnetic ordering loop was proved for BFO films on VA-MWCNTs having a \ncoercive field of 700 Oe.  \n\nOur systematic work is a significant step forward in the development of 3D memory \ncells; it clearly demonstrates that CNTs can be combined with FE oxides and can \nbe used, for example, as the next 3D generation of FERAMs, not excluding however \nother different applications in microelectronics. \n\n \nReferences: \n1. \"http://www.itrs.net/Links/2011ITRS/2011Chapters/2011MEMS.pdf\". \n2.

This \n\nprogress is well seen from the miniaturization of devices, devices with multi-functionality \n\nand high data transfer rate (4G technology expected to move to 5G by 2025). \n\nIn today\u2019s world, we all are connected with each other by wireless technology \n\nusing smart phones and smart devices. All the devices are connected by internet network. \n\nThe day is not far when we live in ultra-digitally responsive world, where more things are \n\nexponentially connected to the internet than people. Thomson Reuters predict by 2025 \n\nthat this digital connectivity will encompass and join vast geographies [1]. The rising of \n\ndigitization demands new set of systems, circuits architectures and materials, which can \n\nfurther support the reduction of the size of the devices, increasing the energy storage \n\ncapacity with high charging rate and memories with high data storage capacity. Thanks \n\nto the recent progress in the improvement of semiconductors, development of graphene \n\nand carbon nanotubes (CNTs) these predictions will be soon a reality. \n\nWithin the electronics industry, one of the major trends in these last few years has \n\nbeen the ability to exponentially decrease the minimum feature size used to fabricate \n\nintegrated circuits in accordance with Moore\u2019s Law [2]. But this miniaturization trend \n\nchallenges board assembly materials, processes, and reliability. Nevertheless the \n\nminiaturization of silicon-based electronics has limits. On this background the Road Map \n\nfor Semiconductor Industry (ITRS) suggests since 2011 alternative technologies, \n\ndesignated as More than Moore; being one of them based on the use of carbon (carbon \n\nnanotubes (CNTs) and graphene) [3]. The ITRS has specifically suggested that carbon \n\nnano structures, and carbon-based nano composites in particular, are part of the driving \n\nforce behind this transformation, and are poised to take centre stage in high-energy \n\ndensity and power-density applications for microelectronics. Carbon nano composites can \n\nbe used as supercapacitive electrodes, either in two-or-three-dimensional structures, with \n\nhigh surface area.  \n\nOne of the areas of microelectronics where further miniaturization is getting \n\ndifficult is the area related with Non-Volatile Ferroelectric Random Access Memory \n\n(NV-FeRAM). \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices   \n3 \n\nScientific motivation and rationale \n\nFeRAM is the memory storage device similar to a dynamic random access \n\nmemory (DRAM), in which instead of a dielectric it uses of ferroelectric (FE) material, \n\ntypically as lead zirconium titanate (PbZr1-xTixO3, PZT). FRAM stores information using \n\nthe polarization of a ferroelectric material placed between two electrodes. At present the \n\nmemory cells are in the form of planar or stack cells as illustrated in Figure 1-1 (a), where \n\nthe FE layer is embedded between the top and bottom electrodes and the thickness of the \n\nFE layer is from 90 to 150 nm. Further reduction of the FE thickness results in the \n\nlowering of the signals below 100 fC (this is the comfort zone for FeRAM cell according \n\nto 1T -1C design) and results in a poor signal reliability, cross talk between the memory \n\ncells and high leakage current [4]. \n\nThe possible solution for this problem is to radically alter the configuration and \n\nsubstitute this classical two dimension (2D) memory cell structure by a completely new \n\none, based on a three dimension (3D) structure cell design (Figure 1-1 (b)), taking \n\nadvantage of one dimension (1D) nanostructures. The 3D memory cells structure provides \n\nlarge areas for bottom and top electrodes resulting in enhancement of capacitance and \n\nsignal strength. Moreover, it was predicted theoretically that 1D structures increase the \n\nstorage capacity up to 10,000-fold [5, 6]. Not only in memory cells, the 3D FE structures \n\nin form of nanotrenchs, nano rods, nano bars and nanotubes have a vast set of \n\napplications, such as energy harvesters, microfluidic systems, electrocaloric coolers for \n\ncomputers, phased-array radar, high-power microwave devices, among others [7]. Very \n\nrecently Intel Corporation has develop a 3D transistor part of the 13 quad core processors \n\nhaving 20 % better performance with 20 % less power consumption than predecessor [8].  \n\nOne possible way to get 3D FE cells is to use carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as bottom \n\nelectrode or template to fabricate FE nanostructures, due to its tubular shape, high \n\nconductivity, ballistic electron transport and a huge current - carrying capacity, which \n\nmake them of great interest [11]. For memories applications CNTs can act as a bottom \n\nelectrode, on which FE is deposited as shown in Figure 1-2 (a) or interconnects as in \n\ntransistors and as the channel material in 3 D Field Effect Transistor (FET) (Figure 1-2 \n\n(b)) [11]. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices   \n4 \n\nScientific motivation and rationale \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1-1 (a) Memory cell for FeRAM with one transistor and one capacitor (1T1C) \n\narchitect planar structure, where bottom electrode is in shape of 2D structure (film) [9] \n\nand (b) Schematic illustrates 3D FeRAM cell where bottom electrode is in shape of tube, \n\ninset on top left shows the possible schematic of the 3D FeRAM [10]. \n\nHowever these new configurations for FE applications raised many questions that \n\nneed to be answered before any prototype demonstration and fabrication: Will CNTs \n\nwork as bottom electrode? How can CNTs be integrated with FE materials, when \n\noxidation temperature and phase formation temperature of FE is so close? How will the \n\n(b) \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices   \n5 \n\nScientific motivation and rationale \n\ninterfaces between FE and CNTs affect the electrical performance. These are some of the \n\nmany questions to be answered in these new structural designs. \n\n  \n\nFigure 1-2 Schematic illustration of the possible use of CNTs as a bottom electrode (1 D \n\nstructure) (a) and for 3D memory cell design covered with FE (b) use of CNTs as a \n\nchannel in FET transistor (adapted from [12]). \n\nThe combination of CNTs with FE can be an elegant approach to reduce capacitor \n\nsize in integrated FeRAM circuits as well. Pursuing this idea, Kawasaki et al. [13] (year \n\n2007) combined successfully for the first time FE thin films and MWCNTs. The authors \n\ndemonstrated the possibility of conformably coating Multi Wall CNTs (MWCNTs) with \n\nhigh-dielectric oxide as a first step toward ultrahigh integration density of three-\n\ndimensional FeRAM. However, this is a very preliminary work and the authors reported \n\nseveral problems associated with carbon lattice damage, siphoning of the substrate \n\nmaterial and the stoichiometry of PZT that need to be addressed. Till today there are only \n\na few reports on the combination of FE with CNTs [13-31]. And most of the literature \n\nlacks in systematic studies on the phase formation of FE in presence of CNTs, interface \n\nstudies and measurement of FE properties. The detail summary on the state of the art on \n\nCNTs-FE nano structures is given in Chapter 2. Anyhow these works are important being \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices   \n6 \n\nScientific motivation and rationale \n\nconsidered as landmarks, since they demonstrated the feasibility of the fabrication of \n\nCNTs-FE nano structures. These previous also highlight the need for more systematic \n\nworks on the fabrication of these CNTs-FE nanostructures and somehow supporting the \n\nR&amp;D performed in the present work. At the same time the development of lead free FE \n\nand lead free multiferroic 3D nanostructures is pertinent and highly desirable, as well.  \n\nTherefore the main aim of the present work is fabrication and characterization of \n\nCNTs-FE structures to: i) identify optimised fabrication strategies, as compatibility of \n\nboth materials is an issue, ii) accumulate new knowledge on CNTs\u2013FE interface \n\nphenomena as the structure properties are largely determined by them, iii) exploit \n\ndifferent structures as embryonic forms of high density hard-wired FRAM capacitor \n\narrays and iv) measure the ferroelectric response of the CNTs-FE. \n\nThe novelty and originality of these studies include: \n\n-synthesis of functional nanostructures of 1D nano lead based, lead free ferroic \n\nstructures with CNTs, in which CNTs will be used as the template or bottom conductor \n\nto fabricate 1D ferroelectric nanostructures;  \n\n-to exploit low cost hydrothermal / chemical methods to grow FE on CNTs; \n\n-to study systematically interfaces/surface modification between CNTs and FE to \n\noptimize their growth;  \n\n-to measure local electrical properties of MWCNTs-FE structures using piezo \n\nforce microscope (PFM); \n\nMaterials for FeRAM are selected based on the properties, which are considered \n\nto be the most important in the operation of memory devices and based on processing \n\nrequests as well [10] and these are:  \n\n-the remanent polarization (Pr), that need to be as high as possible, so that sensing \n\nmargin between the two states is well defined; \n\n-the coercive field (Ec) should be small so that device can operate at low voltage;  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices   \n7 \n\nScientific motivation and rationale \n\n-the fatigue is other aspect to be considered; it is defined as the steady loss of \n\n remanent polarization of the material and should be minimal; \n\n-the retention state over time, this need to be about ten year\u2019s retention at 85 \u00baC; \n\n-the crystallization temperature needs to be as low as possible so that FE can be \n\neasily integrated on a chip. \n\nBecause commercially in use, PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) and BaTiO3 (BT) are the \n\nfirst choice as a material for our studies. Both PZT and BT depict excellent \n\npolarization/electric field response. And they have been used as material for sensors, \n\nFeRAMs, capacitors and in electro optic devices. In 2006 Fujitsu announced bismuth \n\nferrite (BiFeO3, BFO) as the FE for FeRAM [32]. In addition because BFO, is one of the \n\ntrue single phase multiferroic materials having high polarization (~45 \u00b5C/cm2), besides \n\nbeing a lead free material make it an obvious choice for our studies, as well. Therefore, \n\nthe materials under study in this work are: lead free BT and BFO and lead based PZT to \n\nfabricate CNTs-FE nano structures. General properties of all the three selected FE are \n\nmentioned in Table 1-1.  \n\n1.2 Outline of the thesis \n\nThis chapter (Chapter 1) presents the motivation and the objective of the present \n\nwork. In Chapter 2 a detailed introduction of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) for electronics, \n\nto the basics of ferroelectricity and ferroelectric materials and the comprehensive \n\ndiscussion on ferroelectric behaviour at the nano scale and in nanostructures, passing by \n\nthe fabrication of MWCNTs-FE composite is reported. Chapter 3 describes the \n\nexperimental details carried out along the work, including the purification and \n\nfunctionalization of the MWCNTs used in this work, followed by a concise description \n\non the characterization techniques and conditions used in the present work. Some of the \n\nexperimental details concerning materials preparation are detailed later in Chapters 5 to \n\n7 for each case study.

It starts by \n\nemphasising the importance of carbon in microelectronics followed by the presentation \n\nof the most important concepts, nomenclature and knowledge on Carbon Nanotubes \n\n(CNTs), as synthesis, electrical properties and dependence on temperature and pressure \n\nof the physical properties of CNTs. The basic concepts and definitions of piezoelectricity \n\nare introduced after and followed by details on ferroelectrics. A brief review on \n\nferroelectric behaviour and size effects of ferroelectrics is subsequently presented. The \n\nliterature review on the CNTs-FE structures covers the available information on the topic. \n\nThe chapter further includes details on the two major synthesis approaches, top- down \n\nand bottom up, used for the fabrication of nano structured materials, precisely nano \n\nferroelectrics. The chapter ends with a summary of the presented concepts, indicates the \n\nopportunities and challenges if carbon-based electronics will be further exploited. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n11 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n2.1 Carbon nanotubes for electronics \n\n2.1.1 Why CNTs might be useful in microelectronics? \n\nThe Holy Grail for semiconductor industries is to keep following Moore\u00b4s law [2], \n\nin what concerns the scaling of conventional silicon based integrated circuits to even \n\nsmaller feature sizes. The smallest element printed on the chip in repeatedly array or the \n\nhalf pitch of the DRAM is known as feature size. From the last 45 years the feature size \n\nhas been reduced from 10 \u00b5m to 22 nm in silicon microelectronic devices [8]. The small \n\nfeatures have been mainly fabricated by lithography processes, but it\u2019s getting difficult to \n\nfurther achieve small feature sizes without affecting the electrical properties of the \n\ndevices. Continuous scaling of devices on silicon based microelectronics is getting \n\ndifficult and companies are exploring new sets of nano-materials such as CNTs and \n\ngraphene in order to go beyond silicon based microelectronics [36]. The global market \n\nrevenue for CNTs is expected to reach $2,398.4 million by 2018 in various sector \n\nincluding microelectronics [37]. \n\nCNTs is the prime material under consideration due to its extraordinary electrical \n\nand mechanical properties. In addition to this, it has quasi one dimension (1D) structure \n\nwhich helps in unidirectional current flow and long mean free path (up to few hundred \n\nnanometer). CNTs can offer scattered free ballistic transportation for small channel \n\ndevices, hence low power dissipation and has good thermal conductivity [38, 39]. The \n\nabove properties make CNTs as a perfect channel material for Field Effect Transistors \n\n(FET). Digital circuits based on transistors fabricated from CNTs have the potential to \n\noutperform silicon by improving the energy efficiency of the product by more than one \n\norder of magnitude. Hence, CNTs are a promising complement to the existing \n\nsemiconductor technologies [40]. \n\nThe first potential use of semiconducting single wall CNTs (SWCNTs) with a \n\ndiameter of 1 nm was demonstrated in 1998 by the University of Delft and IBM \n\nCorporation for field effect transistors (FET) (Figure 2-1) [41, 42]. In FET the SWCNTs \n\nare used as a channel material. They demonstrated that the conductance of semiconductor \n\nSWCNTs can be modified by an order of magnitude (~ 105) by externally applying a gate \n\n(\n\nb) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n12 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nvoltage, similar to that of a metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistor \n\n(MOSFET). Transistors made from CNTs depict 20 times less switching resistance and \n\n200 times more current handling capacities than conventional MOSFETs. This was a \n\nrevolutionary finding among the scientific community that demonstrates the potential \n\nusefulness of CNTs FET. The reports on the first use of CNTs in digital circuit application \n\ncame in 2001, when CNT - based logic gate by integrating n-type and p-type nanotube \n\ntransistors was demonstrated. [43-45]. n and p type semiconductor CNTs can be prepared \n\nby the integration of metals with different work functions (smaller for the case of n-type \n\nand higher for p-type semiconductor, respectively) [46, 47]. The potential of CNTs was \n\nalso explored for the Radio frequency (RF) applications as a planar RF transistors, self-\n\naligned T-gate RF transistors and transistors with embedded bottom gate [48-50]. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-1 Atomic force micrograph of FET device constructed using single wall carbon \n\nnanotubes [41, 42]. \n\nCVD grown CNTs can be processed into thin films of CNTs by solution transfer \n\nmethods. The thin films of CNTs have a great potential application for flexible devices. \n\nThese films have excellent transparency which makes them a preferential material for \n\nfuture electronics displays. The potential of semiconducting CNTs for thin films \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n13 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\ntransistors (TFTs) was demonstrated [51-53]. CNTs TFTs have been employed as active \n\nmatrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) arrays [19]. The schematic diagram of \n\none pixel of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) controlled by CNTs network based \n\ndriver circuit is given in Figure 2-2 (a). This is the first demonstration of AMOLED arrays \n\nwith 500 pixels driven by 1000 CNT TFTs. Figure 2-2 (b) depicts AMOLED arrays \n\nfabricated on glass substrates. Figure 2-2 (c) shows an optical image for the OLEDs lights \n\non CNT TFTs with yield efficiency of 70 %. CNTs TFTs has also been employed in the \n\ncontrol of circuits for pressure sensing elements in electronic skin (Figure 2-3) [54]. It \n\nwas proved that this flexible CNTs network-based FETs can be processed at room \n\ntemperature, hence less expensive what is indeed important from the industrial and \n\nconsumer point of view [53]. \n\nMore recently in 2013, Shulaker et al. [55] demonstrate the first CNTs based \n\ncomputer. This computer is entirely built on CNTs-based transistors in which CNTs are \n\nused as channel material. The CNTs computer runs an operating system that is capable of \n\nmultitasking.  \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n14 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n  \n\nFigure 2-2 (a) Schematic diagram for the construction of one pixel of OLED controlled \n\nby CNTs, (b) Arrays of AMOLED fabricated on transparent glass substrate and (c) \n\nilluminating arrays of green light of AMOLED with the CNTs based network circuit [56].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-3 Represent the pressured OLEDs containing FETs where CNTs are used as \n\nchannel material [54]. \n\n(c) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n15 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nOther than FETs, CNTs have been studied for interconnectors applications due to \n\nits high current density up to 109 A/cm2 which is more than 100 times that of copper and \n\nhigh surface area. In CMOS two kinds of interconnectors are used, named as horizontal \n\nand vertical interconnectors (Figure 2-4). Horizontal interconnectors join FETs in \n\ndifferent parts of an integrated circuit. There are many layers of horizontal interconnectors \n\nin CMOS and each layer is separated by a dielectric. The vertical interconnectors called \n\nas vias, and they pass through holes in the dielectric to join horizontal interconnectors to \n\nthe source and drain or gate electrode of a FET as shown in Figure 2-4 [11]. Defect free \n\nMWCNTs with sizes ranging from 20 to 100 nm in bundles or as individual have proven \n\nthe potential to be used as metallic interconnectors. The high thermal conductivity of \n\nCNTs is also very useful for chip thermal management and dissipation of heat in devices \n\n[57]. Fujitsu Ltd. and Infineon Technologies AG have carried out extensive studies on \n\nthe fabrication of interconnectors [58-60]. \n\nThe high surface area of CNTs depicts, make them ideal material to fabricate \n\nsensors with high sensitivity. CNTs transistors was tested as sensor and depicts high \n\nsensitivity to low concentration of NO2 and NH3 [61].The CNT transistor shows the \n\nincrease in conductance when come in contact with NO2 and NH3. The phenomena was \n\ninterpreted by the charge transfer mechanism between gasses and CNTs. Further, \n\ndevelopment shows the CNT transistor based sensors can detect 100 ppm level of NO2 \n\ngas [62]. \n\nNantero Inc. demonstrated the use of MWCNTs sandwiched between two metallic \n\nelectrodes to form resistive Nanotube based / Non-volatile random access memory \n\n(NRAM) cell. Figure 2-5 (a) shows the SEM micrograph of NRAM cell where CNTs are \n\nembedded inside the tungsten electrodes. Figure 2-5 (b) shows the various steps followed \n\nto fabricate the NRAM cells from the heterostructure of SiO/TiN/CNT/W. The memory \n\nworks based on the principle of change in the resistance that occurs due to the interaction \n\nbetween CNTs attach on the top and bottom electrode shown in Figure 2-5 (c) [32].  \n\nThe first commercial application for CNTs in microelectronics was realized as a \n\ncomposite with polymer (polycarbonate-ABS), which is used as electric discharge \n\nmaterial in automobiles [63]. Other than electric discharge application composites based \n\non CNTs can be used as electromagnetic interference shielding, as well [64]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n16 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \n\nFigure 2-4 Schematic of the two kinds of interconnects in which CNTs can be used in \n\nCMOS circuitry design (adapted and modified from [11]). \n\nOne of the areas of microelectronics where further miniaturization is getting \n\ndifficult is the area of memories, in particular Non Volatile Ferroelectric Random Access \n\nMemory (NV-FERAM) (detailed in Chapter 1). Therefore, there is need to move from \n\n2D designs to 3D design which results in the high reliability and sensing of the signals \n\ndue to the large contribution from bottom electrode. One way to achieve this 3D design \n\nis using CNTs. CNTs are tubular in geometry and have unique set of properties, including \n\nballistic electron transportation and a huge current caring capacity, this make them of \n\ngreat interest for future FeRAM [11]. The idea of using CNTs covered with dielectric \n\nmaterial for Nanoelectromechanical dynamic random access memory non-volatile was \n\nfirst put forward by Jang et al. [14], later followed for non-volatile ferroelectric memory \n\n[21].  \n\nTo integrate CNTs with complex functional oxide such as ferroelectric there is \n\nneed for detail and comprehensive assessment on various aspects, mainly on synthesis \n\nand properties. So that CNTs can be effectively used for microelectronic devices \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n17 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\napplications.

However, it know by now that first electron micrograph published \n\nback in 1952 by Radushkevich and Lukyanovich in the Journal of Physcial Chemistry of \n\nRussia [65]. The micrograph shows the carbon filaments exhibiting a inner cavity having \n\n(c) \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n18 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\ndiameter of 50 nm. However, the work might be not highlighted due to the cold war and \n\ndiscouraging of citing articles written in Russian language by west. Iijima work has get \n\nmaximum importance because of the fundamental physics and systematic growth \n\nmechanism discussed on the formation of CNTs [66].  \n\nIn the following years, the properties of CNTs were studied theoretically and \n\nexploited by different experimental methods. CNTs show extraordinary charge carrier \n\nmobility (2 - 6) \u00d7 104 cm2/(V\u00b7s)), with a band gap (1 eV) dependent on the specific \n\nordering of carbon atoms in the nanotube, and a maximal electrical current density of \n\n>109 A/cm2 (~100 times higher than copper wires). In addition CNTs has Young\u2019s \n\nmodulus of 0.8 to 1.8 TPa and tensile strength of ~63 GPa far better than steel (Young\u2019s \n\nmodulus ~0.2 TPa and tensile strength 1.55 GPa) [67-69]. The electrical properties of \n\nCNTs are mainly dependent on the chirality (tube diameter and wrapping angle \n\ndetermined by vector (m, n)), which creates a big challenge in terms of CNTs synthesis \n\nto develop a method by which one can control the chirality of the tubes. The task of \n\nproducing samples containing CNTs of a specific chirality is difficult and is still open for \n\nfurther research [70]. In spite of that, CNTs have found already vast applications when \n\nused as fillers in composites to strengthen the mechanical properties of materials, \n\nespecially oxides and polymers [71]. \n\nCNTs are formed by rolling a graphite sheet in to a seamless hollow cylinder. The \n\nCNTs are classified based on the rolling direction to get different diameter and helicity \n\nof the tubes. The circumference of CNTs is determined by the chiral vector C? h, that is \n\ndefined by C? h = ma1? + na2? , where m and n are integers and \u00e21 and \u00e22 are unit vectors as \n\nrepresented in Figure 2-6 [72]. The chiral vector of graphene sheet becomes a \n\ncircumferential line of the tubes when they are rolled to form CNTs. The CNTs with a \n\nroll-up vector of the form n = m are called armchair tubes and chiral vector angle is 30\u00ba. \n\nZigzag tubes are characterized by the roll-up vector, either n or m, being zero and the \n\nchiral vector equal to 30\u00ba. Both zigzag and armchair are achiral tubes and all other tubes \n\nare known as chiral tubes or helical, where n ? m and chiral vector angle lies between 0 \n\nand 30\u00ba. The diameter of the tubes, d, is defined as:  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n19 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \nd =  \n\na?m2 + mn + n2\n\n?\n \n\nEquation 2-1 \n\nwhere a is the C-C bond length of the graphene sheet. \n\nCNTs are further divided by the number of graphene sheets rolled to form \n\nconcentric graphene sheets. If seamless tube form from the rolling of single sheet of \n\ngraphene it is called a Single Wall CNTs (SWCNTs). If two sheets are rolled to form \n\nconcentric circle these are known as Double Wall CNTs (DWCNTs). The third type are \n\ncalled Multi Wall CNTs (MWCNTs), where concentric graphene tubes are stacked one \n\ninto the other (Figure 2-7). MWCNTs were the ones described in the landmark paper of \n\nIijima [73]. The discovery of SWCNTs came later in 1993 [74, 75]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-6 A sheet of graphene rolled to in particular directions to form three different \n\nkind of single walled carbon nanotubes, named as armchair, zigzag and chiral [72, 76]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n20 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \n\nFigure 2-7 Classification of CNTs based on the no. of graphene sheets rolled \n\nconcentrically single wall CNTs, double wall CNTs and multi wall CNTs (from left to \n\nright ) [77]. \n\n2.2.1 Electronic properties of CNTs \n\nCNTs depict metallic, semi metallic and semiconductor (with band gap of 1 eV) \n\nproperties. The electrical properties are mainly dependent on the values of n and m, as \n\nfirst predicted by Saito [71, 72, 78, 79]. It was found that depending on the chiral vector \n\n1/3rd of the nanotubes are metallic and 2/3rd of them are semiconducting. Armchair \n\nnanotubes are always metallic, while other chirality can be metallic or semiconducting. \n\nIn CNTs C atoms form both ? and ? bonds. In CNTs lattice the unhybridized ? orbitals \n\nare responsible for the transportation of the ? electrons through the nanotubes. In the axial \n\ndirection the ? electrons move freely throughout the lattice due to no constrictions [72], \n\nwhereas in the radial direction electrons are confined by the monolayer thickness of the \n\ngraphene sheet [69]. There is a destructive interface of electrons (as wave) by itself if the \n\nwavelength of the electron is not a multiple of the circumference of the nanotubes [80]. \n\nTherefore the dominant conduction path in CNTs is along the axis of the tubes. The \n\nrolling of the graphene sheet results in the ? orbitals more delocalized outside the CNTs \n\nand ? bonds being slightly out of plane [77]. This results in CNTs more thermally and \n\nelectrically conducting. \n\nMWCNTs usually consists of the several tubes rolled one on other with interlayer \n\ndistance in each layer of approximately 3.4 \u00c5. The bending of the graphene sheet and its \n\ninfluence on the electrical and structural properties of MWCNTs are similar to SWCNTs. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n21 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nHowever, even if the MWCNTs consist of rolling of semiconducting tubes they behave \n\nas semi-metallic due to their reduce band gap [77]. Due to their metallic nature and large \n\nnumber of walls they are potential candidates to be used as bottom conducting electrodes \n\nfor future microelectronic devices.  \n\n2.2.2 Synthesis of CNTs \n\nMWCNTs are the first CNTs synthesised by Iijima (1991) [73] by arc discharge \n\nmethod which was adopted from the early investigators on the synthesis of fullerenes [73, \n\n75, 81, 82]. In arc discharge method, discharge between the two graphitic electrodes (6 - \n\n12 mm diameter) separated by 1 - 4 mm takes place inside a chamber filled with an inert \n\natmosphere. With the application of a bias across the electrode carbon is ejected from the \n\npositive electrode and deposited on the negative electrode, resulting in the formation of \n\nMWCNTs [83]. In order to synthesised SWCNTs by arc discharge method, the graphite \n\nelectrodes are loaded with metallic catalysts (Fe, Co, Ni, Y, Mo). The graphite electrodes \n\nare vaporized along with the catalyst and carbon condenses in the form of SWCNTs [81, \n\n84-87]. \n\nIn the later years (1995) laser ablation method was used to produce CNTs, mostly \n\nSWCNTs [81, 83, 88, 89]. In laser ablation method, a graphite target is ablated by the \n\npowerful laser in inert helium or argon atmosphere (also acting as carrier gas) and results \n\nin the evaporation of carbon. These carbon atoms are carried by the carrier gas to the cold \n\ncooper collector on which they condense in the shape of nanotubes [88, 90].  \n\nHowever, both arc discharge and laser ablation method does not yield large \n\namounts of CNTs as required for a full industrial adoption of CNTs. The breakthrough \n\ntechnique that enabled CNTs to become an industrial material was a route that involved \n\nChemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) [91, 92]. In CVD process the hydrocarbon vapor \n\nthermally decomposed on the surface of catalyst and precipitate to form CNTs. Indeed, \n\nthe catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbons was used well before the discovery of CNTs \n\nfor the production of certain kinds of carbon fibres [93, 94]. Although slow, this method \n\nyield long and large amounts of CNTs. This synthesis route makes possible the production \n\nof CNTs in a continuous manner and enables a kind of control over the nanotube \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n22 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nparameters that other techniques do not offers [95, 96], including: the patterned growth \n\nof nanotubes [97], the growth of centimetre long nanotubes [98], doped CNTs [99], \n\namong others. \n\nThe MWCNTs used in the present studies were fabricated by CVD, therefore the \n\nprocedure is explained here more comprehensively. \n\nIn a thermal CVD setup (Figure 2-8), the substrate (or holder) embedded with a \n\ncatalyst is placed in the centre of the quartz tube, which was flashed with inert gas, like \n\nH2 at 400 \u00baC for 30 min in order to reduce the catalyst. Transition metal nano particles \n\nare used as catalysts, usually Fe, Ni, Co, Mo either in the pure form or as an alloy [100, \n\n101]. CNTs synthesis begins on the nano particles (used as catalyst) with a suitable source \n\nof hydrocarbon (methane, ethane, ethanol, benzene) [102]. The hydrocarbon source is \n\nheated at high temperature, in the range of 700 oC to 1200 oC [103], inside the quartz \n\ntube. The hydrocarbon gas at high temperature is thermally decomposed into hydrogen \n\nand carbon, the carbon atoms diffuse on the surface of the metallic nano particles, forming \n\nan amorphous carbon shell around the metal catalysts. This amorphous carbon rearranges \n\nitself into an hexagonal network and finally precipitates in the form of CNTs. The \n\ntermination of CNTs occurs when the metal particles are fully covered with CNTs walls \n\nand future diffusivity of carbon as a feedstock on the surface of catalyst is constraints by \n\nalready grown CNTs walls [104]. \n\nTwo types of mechanisms for CNTs growth are known: base growth and tip \n\ngrowth. The type of growth depends mainly on the interaction between the catalysts and \n\nthe base (substrate). If the interaction of the catalyst particles with the support (substrate) \n\nis strong it yields CNTs on the top of the particles and this is known as base growth type \n\n(Figure 2-9 (a)). Conversely, when the interaction is not so strong between the support \n\nand the particles CNTs grow between the support and the metal particles and this \n\nmechanism is known as tip growth (Figure 2-9 (b)). Both experimentally and theoretically \n\nit was proven that CNTs diameter is highly dependent on the catalyst size [105, 106]. It \n\nis important to mention that during the synthesis of CNTs there is the formation of \n\nsecondary forms of carbon such as amorphous carbon, fullerene and graphene. The \n\npresence of these secondary phases affects markedly the quality of the CNTs. Therefore, \n\npost treatments based on chemical and thermal treatments are needed to remove unwanted \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n23 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\ncarbon allotropes. Still up to day it is a challenge to develop a technique by which only a \n\nparticular chirality of CNTs is synthesised with a minimum amount of secondary phases. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-8 Schematic of a CVD setup for the synthesis of CNTs [107].  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-9 Illustration of two growth mechanisms of CNTs: (a) base growth and (b) tip \n\ngrowth. These growth mechanisms are dependent on the interaction of the catalyst and \n\nsupport (substrate) [108]. \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n24 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n2.2.3 Functionalization of CNTs \n\nCarbon nanotubes are naturally hydrophobic, and in order to optimised their \n\nsurface for posteriori use or to alter physical and/or electrical properties, their outer \n\nsurface needs to be modified and usually CNTs are functionalized by chemicals and \n\nphysical methods [109-111]. \n\nWithin the chemical functionalization, the modification of the CNTs surface can \n\nbe categorised as: (a) covalent attachment of the chemical group to the side walls of \n\nCNTs, (b) non-covalent attachment of the chemical group to the side walls of CNTs, \n\nwhere the chemical species adsorbed or wrapped on the surface of the CNTs; and (c) the \n\nendohedral filling of CNTs inner empty cavity, as illustrated in Figure 2-10 [109, 112].  \n\nIn covalent type the functionalized groups, like hydroxyl and carboxylic groups, \n\nare formed at defect sites of CNTs with ?-conjugate. The attachment of functional groups \n\nto the nanotubes usually takes place at defect sites present at the walls or at the caps of \n\nCNTs. This is due to the lower activation energy for chemical reaction at defect sites \n\n(vacancies, non-hexagonal arrangement of C atoms, etc.) [110]. Covalent attachment \n\nalways influence the properties of CNTs, for example in the case of fluorine atoms when \n\nattached they adopt the tetrahedral coordination and the sp3 hybridization, which destroys \n\nthe electronic band structure [113, 114]. In the non-covalent functionalization functional \n\ngroups wrapped up the CNTs by Van Der Waals forces and ?- ? stacking. Some examples \n\nof chemicals which can be used for non-covalent functionalization are sodium dodecyl \n\nbenzene sulfonate (NaDDBS), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and poly vinyl pyrrolidone \n\n(PVP). \n\nEndohedral functionalization is the filling of the inner empty cavity of CNTs. This \n\nfilling can be performed by two methods: i) physical and ii) wet chemical. In the physical \n\none the open tubes are directly immersed in the molten materials (no solvent is used). The \n\ntubes are filled by the molten metals due to the capillary forces. Dujardin et al. [115] \n\nsuggested that the filling of metals with high surface tension such as lead [116], bismuth \n\n[117] and cesium [115] occurred due to the formation of oxides or carbide compounds as \n\na result of the reaction with oxygen and/or carbon. The carbides or oxides of those metals \n\nhave a surface tension lower than the surface tension of pure elements, allowing \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n25 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\ncompounds to fill the nanotubes by capillary action. Therefore, the filling of tubes is may \n\nbe related with oxides rather than pure metal particles.  \n\nOther method of filling CNTs is by wet chemistry. In 1994, Tsang et al. [118] \n\nfilled nanotubes with metal oxide particles such as cobalt, nickel and iron. They used a \n\nnitric based metal solutions to open the end of the CNTs by refluxing CNTs in the nitric \n\nsolution and, simultaneous filling took place with the metal salts. The tubes were annealed \n\nat 200 to 400 \u00baC, so that metal salt decomposes and forms the respective element. Gold, \n\nsilver, platinum particles were also filled in CNTs by wet chemical method [119-122]. \n\nOther than oxides, biomolecules and liquids were also filled in CNTs for various \n\nbiomedical and storage application; more details can be found in reference [71]. The \n\nCNTs inner cavity offers space for the storage of guest molecules which can be used to \n\nproduce confined nano structures, for hydrogen storage and drug delivery applications \n\n[115, 123-125]. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-10 Scematic representation of the various types of functionlization of CNTs: (a-\n\nb)  covalent, ( c, d) non-covalent and (e) endohedral functionalization[126]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n26 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n2.2.4 Effect of temperature and pressure on CNTs \n\nAs mentioned above one of the main objectives of this work is to cover MWCNTs \n\nwith ferroelectric oxide layers. However, it is known that the ferroelectrics oxides have \n\ngenerally high temperature of crystallization of around 700 to 1000 \u00baC. In this particular \n\nor any other application in which CNTs will be submitted to pressure and or temperature, \n\nrequires knowledge on the effect of temperature and pressure on CNTs and their \n\ndependence on the type of CNTs. \n\nAccording to the literature CNTs starts oxidizing around ~500 \u00baC. Therefore, \n\ncombining ferroelectric oxides with CNTs, for 1D structure might be quite challenging, \n\nespecially, when CNTs are needed to be used as a bottom electrodes. There are various \n\nfactors which affect the oxidation of MWCNTs. Here, is a brief literature review on the \n\nthermal oxidation of MWCNTs.  \n\nIt is established that the thermal stability of CNTs depend on two main parameters \n\ni) type of CNTs and ii) diameter of CNTs [127-133]. The activation energy for oxidation \n\nof carbon nanotubes depends on the types of CNTs, here we listed activation energy from \n\nlow to high as follow. The first species to start oxidize are SWCNTs (325 \u00baC), closely \n\nfollow by amorphous carbon (350 \u00baC), then DWCNTs, MWCNTs (450 \u00baC) and the most \n\nstable carbon form is graphite (starts oxidizing at around 700 \u00baC). The second parameter \n\nis the size and diameter of the tube [131, 134]. Tubes with smaller diameters and lengths \n\nhave higher surface energies and strains resulting in poor resistance to oxidation. \n\nTherefore tubes with small diameters and lengths oxidize first followed by tubes with \n\nbigger diameters.  \n\nAs known, produced CNTs contain different carbon species (or impurities) such \n\nas amorphous carbon, graphite and fullerenes. All these species have different C-C bond \n\nlengths, curvature what influences the decomposition (oxidation) temperature of CNTs; \n\ntherefore for any further application and maximization of their properties tubes need to \n\nbe purified before being processed. Chemical and thermal treatments are the current \n\nprocedures used for the purification of CNTs. The effect of purification on the thermal \n\nbehaviour of CNTs has been part of many publications. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n27 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nThe thermal stability of the chemically purified CNTs (using acids as HCL, HF \n\nand nitric acid) was monitored by DTA/TG, HRTEM, Raman spectroscopy, Wide Angle \n\nX-ray Diffraction, among others [135-139]. It was demonstrated that there is an increase \n\nin the oxidation temperature of MWCNTs after the chemical purification due to the \n\nremoval of amorphous carbon and metal catalysts. It was also reported that the treatment \n\nwith nitric acid for 2 h results in the increase of the crystallinity of MWCNTs by 85 % \n\nand hence the thermal stability of the tubes by 5 to 10 \u00baC [140].  \n\nThe other method for purification is a thermal treatment. The thermal treatments \n\nreported in the literature were carried out in air or in inert atmosphere. For tubes thermally \n\ntreated in air at around 350 to 500 \u00baC the amorphous carbon was eliminated and resulted \n\nin improved thermal stability of the tubes [141, 142]. The other way to purify CNTs is to \n\nanneal in inert atmosphere [143] or in vacuum [143-145] at very high temperature (2000 \n\n\u00baC). By systematic studies of comparison of the activation energy of oxidation of \n\nMWCNTs using TEM and Raman it was found to be an effective method to remove \n\nimpurities and enhance graphitization of CNTs and, as a consequence, to increase the \n\nthermal resistance of CNTs [146, 147]. \n\nFor some particular applications the pressure stability of CNTs might be \n\nimportant. The best way to characterize the pressure effect on the CNTs is to monitor the \n\nshift in Raman radial and tangential modes (Raman peaks). It was found that with the \n\nincrease in pressure there is a linear shift in the tangential mode 5.7 cm-1/GPa  up to 1.7 \n\nGPa, followed by the change in the value of the slope for further pressure increase up to \n\n5 GPa [148]. On releasing the pressure tangential bands come back to its original position \n\nwith small delay for all hollow nano structures. No significant change in the electrical \n\ntransportation behaviour was observed for CNTS with applied pressure of 2 GPa [149]. \n\nExperiments carried out at high pressure and temperature showed that a pressure of 5.5 \n\nGPa and temperature of 950 oC is needed for MWCNTs to deform and form other \n\nstructure such as ribbon or onion like [150-152]. Further, increase in temperature to 1500 \n\n\u00baC results in the formation of diamond [153].  \n\nHowever, it was found that there is no systematic study on the effect of different \n\natmosphere and heating conditions on the oxidation of MWCNTs. Therefore and within \n\nthe aim of the present work, the effect of different atmospheres and temperature was \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n28 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nstudied so that different experimental condition can be explored to obtain crystalline \n\nferroelectrics on CNTs. These results will be presented in chapter 4. \n\n2.3 Functional oxides: ferroics \n\n2.3.1 Definitions, classification and application of ferroics \n\nFunctional materials are characterized as materials which possess particular native \n\nproperties and functions [154]. The classification of functional materials is usually related \n\nto materials whose function is associated with electric, magnetic and optical properties. \n\nFunctional materials are found in all classes of materials: ceramics, glasses, organic \n\noxides and polymers. Ceramics functional materials mainly include dielectrics, \n\npyroelectrics, piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, ferroelectric relaxors, incipient ferroelectrics, \n\nsemiconductors, ionic conductors, superconductors, electro-optics, magnetics and \n\nmultiferroics. Application of these materials includes medical diagnostics such as \n\nultrasonic imaging, aerospace such as accelerometers and micro positioners, automotive \n\nsuch as solid state piezoelectric fuel injectors, chemical and process control, which \n\nrequires the use of thermal, strain and force sensors, in memories such as capacitor cell,  \n\nmagnetic sensors, and spintronics [155], among many others. The utility of functional \n\nmaterials in these applications reflects their unique properties, such as spontaneous \n\npolarization, piezoelectricity, superconductivity and magnetoresistance. All these \n\nproperties are directly dependent on the chemical composition, singularities of the \n\ncrystallographic structure and manufacture process. \n\nDielectric materials have high electrical resistivity, which means that ideal \n\ndielectrics do not conduct electricity, due to no or low density of free charge carriers; as \n\na consequence dielectrics are used in insulating applications (e.g insulators used in high \n\nvoltage transmission lines). However, dielectric materials exhibit polarization (P) when \n\nplaced under an electric field. The mathematical derivation of polarization is presented \n\nbelow. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n29 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nThe electric flux density ????? or electric displacement (charge per unit area, C m\n-\n\n2) at a given point of an insulator material is proportional to the electric field (E) and is \n\ngiven by following equation: \n\n ????? = ????? Equation 2-2 \n\nwhere ?o (F m\n-1) and ?r (F m\n\n-1), are the dielectric permittivity of free space (vacuum) and \n\nrelative dielectric permittivity of the material, respectively.  \n\nWhen an electric field is applied to the dielectric material, the trapped charges \n\ninside the material are displaced by some distance in the direction of applied electric field \n\nknown as dipole moment. This displacement produces local dipoles throughout the \n\nmaterial. The sum of all the individual dipole moments within the given volume is called \n\nas polarization (P) of the solid. Polarization measures the additional flux density and is \n\nrepresented by following equation: \n\n ????? = ??? +   ? Equation 2-3 \n\nPolarization equation derived from Equation 2-2 and Equation 2-3 can be \n\nrepresented as: \n\n P = ??(?? ? 1)? Equation 2-4 \n\nIn addition, the polarization and dielectric permittivity of the material can be \n\ncalculated from the capacitance of the material (the ability of the material to store charge) \n\nat a frequency well below mechanical resonances. The total polarization of a solid is the \n\nresult of the contribution of four main mechanisms: atomic polarization, ionic \n\npolarization, dipolar polarization and space polarization (more details in reference [156]). \n\nDielectrics show a linear relationship between the applied field and induced \n\npolarization. For linear dielectrics when the applied field is removed the polarization \n\ndisappears. Whereas, dielectric materials in which electric field develops due to \n\nmechanical stresses or strains develop due to applied electric field are known as \n\npiezoelectrics materials. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n30 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nThe piezoelectric effect was discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880 in \n\nquartz, tourmaline and Rochelle Salt (RS) crystal (sodium potassium tartate tetrahydrate) \n\n[157-159], while studying the effect of pressure on the generation of electrical charges. \n\nThey found that with the application of mechanical forces electrical charges are generated \n\nin the crystal; this is known as a direct effect and the degree of polarization is proportional \n\nto the applied stresses. Piezoelectric crystals also depict the converse effect, where a \n\ngeometrical strain is produced by the application of an electric field. The name \n\n\u00b4\u00b4piezoelectric`` derived from the combination of the two words: piezo and electric, where \n\nthe prefix piezo comes from the Greek word meaning press, therefore piezoelectricity is \n\nthe generation of electricity that results from a mechanical force, or vice versa. The \n\nnecessary condition for a material to be a piezoelectric is to have a non-centro-symmetric \n\nstructure, where the net movement of negative and positive ions in relation to each other \n\nproduces an electric dipole i.e polarization. From the 32 classes of symmetry, 11 point \n\ngroups possess a centre of symmetry hence, they are non-polar and 21 possess a non-\n\ncentro-symmetric structure, hence they are polar or piezoelectric. Form these 21 non \n\ncentro-symmetric 20 point groups materials shows piezoelectric effect. Figure 2-11 \n\nillustrates the interrelationship of piezoelectrics and subgroups on the basis of the \n\ncrystallographic symmetry [160]. \n\nThe mathematical expression for the piezoelectricity is expressed as: \n\n D=??+???               ?????????, ?????? ??????    Equation 2-5 \n\n ?=???+ ??                      ?????, ??????? ??????     Equation 2-6 \n\nwhere D is the dielectric displacement, S the strain, d a piezoelectric coefficient, s the \n\nmaterial compliance, T the stress and ? the dielectric permittivity. The superscripts T and \n\nE represent the quantity held constant; in the case of ?? the stresses are held constant and \n\nin the case of ??  the electric field is held constant in Equation 2-5 and Equation 2-6, \n\nrespectively. Piezoelectricity is a directional property therefore expressed as follow: \n\n ?3 = ?33?3                              (?????? ??????)

Equation 2-8 \n\nwhere d33 is a piezoelectric coefficient with the units (C/N) or (m/V). Figure 2-12 depicts \n\nthe schematic of a direct (generator) and a converse effect (motor) of piezoelectric \n\nmaterials. The suffix of the piezoelectric coefficient d33 indicates the direction of \n\npolarization and the applied mechanical stresses. Where 1, 2 and 3 corresponds to \n\nCartesian coordinate axis x, y and z, respectively. In case the piezoelectric coefficient \n\ngiven by d33, it indicates the polarization generated in 3 (or z) direction (the first suffix) \n\ndue to the application of mechanical stress in the 3 (or z) direction (the second suffix). \n\nFor example in case of piezoelectric coefficient d31, it indicates the polarization \n\ngenerated in the 3 (or z) direction with the application of stress in the 1 (or x) direction.  \n\nHigh d values are desire for piezoelectric materials used in motion or vibrational \n\ndevices. Therefore, the piezoelectric materials which generate large amount of voltage \n\nper unit of input are evaluated by open circuit g coefficient, which is related with \n\npiezoelectric coefficient (d) by following equation: \n\n \n  ? =  \n\n?\n\n????\n \n\nEquation 2-9 \n\nThe common application of these materials is in portable gas igniters and patio lighters. \n\nThere are 10 point groups with in a sub group of piezoelectrics which shows \n\ninduced voltage or polarization when subjected to change in temperature and are known \n\nas pyroelectric materials. All pyroelectric materials show piezoelectric properties but the \n\ninverse is not true. Within the subgroup of pyroelectric materials, a group of materials \n\nwhich depicts spontaneous polarization at zero field conditions and that can be inverted \n\nby inverting the direction of the applied field are known as ferroelectrics. All the \n\nferroelectric materials depict piezoelectric properties. A comprehensive detailed \n\ninformation on ferroelectricity is presented in next section, after the brief introduction to \n\nmagnetoelectrics and multiferroics.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n32 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-11 Interrelationship of piezoelectrics and subgroups on the basis of symmetry \n\n(adapted from [160]). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n33 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \n\nFigure 2-12 Schematic of piezoelectric effect direct (generator) on left and converse effect \n\n(motor) on right [160]. \n\nIn the last decades and so, there has been an outbreak of research focused on a \n\nnew class of materials known as magnetoelectrics and multiferroics [161, 162]. The major \n\ninterest in this field of research is due to its hybrid functionalities, which make a material \n\nsimultaneously ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE). In this case it is possible to \n\ncontrol the magnetic response and/or electrical response (polarization) by the application \n\nof an electric field and/or magnetic field, respectively. This possibility opens a new whole \n\nrange of interesting applications such as magnetic recording media, spintronics and \n\nsensors. Nevertheless, the study of multiferroics is also of scientific fundamental interest \n\n[163].  \n\nThe term multiferroic is defined as a single-phase material that exhibits more than \n\none fundamental functionality (ferroic - ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, ferroelasticity \n\n[164] and ferrotoroidicity [164-166]). The definition can be further broadened if includes \n\nnon-primary order parameters under consideration such as antiferromagnetism, \n\nferrimagnetism and anti-ferroelectricity. On the other hand, magnetoelectric (ME) \n\nmaterials can be multiferroics or non-multiferroics, possessing the cross-coupling \n\nbetween electric and magnetic parameters under external stimuli. The subgroup of ME \n\nand multiferroic materials is given in Figure 2-13. The coupling between the electric and \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n34 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nmagnetic order parameters can be realized by measuring the induced magnetization under \n\nthe action of an external electric field or the vice versa [167]. In 2000, Hill et al. [168] \n\ndemonstrated the conditions required for the existence of ferroelectricity and \n\nferromagnetism in single-phase materials, which are hardly satisfied. Ferroelectricity \n\nneeds broken spatial inversion with invariant time reverse symmetry. In contrast, \n\nmagnetization (M) and magnetic field (H) change their signs upon time reversal and are \n\nunaffected by spatial inversion. Multiferroic system requires simultaneous breaking of \n\nboth time and spatial symmetries. This is possible in spin frustrated systems which always \n\nprefer to have spatially inhomogeneous magnetization and lone pair effect, as in the case \n\nof BiFeO3. \n\nIn the last 10 years, various patents have been registered, from synthesis, \n\ndesigning to applications, of new devices based on multiferroic and magnetoelectric \n\nmaterials [169-174]. In this work we used BiFeO3 a single phase multiferroic to combine \n\nwith MWCNTs for ferroelectric based applications, therefore a more comprehensive \n\ndetailed description on ferroelectricity and ferroelectrics is presented hereafter.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-13 Relationship between multiferroic and magnetoelectric materials.

It took \n\napproximately two centuries to measure the pyroelectric effect and further 60 years to \n\nfind piezoelectric response in RS crystal. Later in 1921, Joseph Valsek [176] proved \n\nexperimentally the ferroelectric nature of RS crystal that had been theoretical predicted \n\nin 1912 [177]. Several studies in the following years were carried out on the crystal \n\nstructure and properties of RS crystals. However, due to its water solubility nature, soon \n\nthe interest diminished. In the mid 40s with the development of high capacitance \n\ncapacitors based on the ferroelectric barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) the interest in FE \n\nreappeared. In 1945 and 1946 the work of Wu and Goldman in USSR [178] and Hippel\u00b4s \n\ngroup in USA [179] established the high dielectric constant and FE behaviour of BaTiO3 \n\nsingle crystals. However, the startling discovery came from Gray [180] in 1949, when he \n\nreported the ferroelectric nature of BaTiO3 ceramics. The authors demonstrated that with \n\nthe application of an external electric field it is possible to orient ferroelectric domains \n\nwithin the grains of the ceramics, in a similar way to the single crystals. These findings \n\nwere the trigger factor that turned polycrystalline BaTiO3 ceramics into one of the most \n\nimportant ferroelectrics of all the times with a great industrial and commercial use. Later, \n\nin 1952 the discovery of high Tc (Curie temperature) lead zirconium titanate (PZT, Pb(Zr1-\n\nxTix)O3) ferroelectrics has given the field of piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics further \n\nimportance, up to the current days. Indeed, at the present 50 % of the microelectronic \n\ndevices used commercially contain lead based functional oxides. However, due to the \n\ntoxicity of lead and regulations from Europe and USA there is a strong need to replace \n\nlead based materials by lead free dielectrics, piezoelectrics and ferroelectrics [181, 182]. \n\nAs said above, ferroelectricity is a property of a material defined as the ability to \n\nswitch the spontaneous polarization by the application of external field [183]. Due to a \n\nnon- centrosymmetric structure, there are dipolar moments in the ferroelectrics that under \n\nzero field conditions originate a spontaneous polarization. For a material that contains \n\nelectric dipoles, the local electric field will promote the dipole alignment in certain \n\nregions, contributing to the increase of the polarization, which, by itself, will promote the \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n36 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nincrease of the local field [155, 160]. These co-operation phenomena will align the dipoles \n\nalong the same direction, resulting in the spontaneous polarizat ion of the material. \n\nConsequently, the electric polarization in ferroelectrics does not vary linearly with the \n\napplied field and hence they are called non-linear dielectrics. In ferroelectrics the \n\nrelationship between the applied field and the polarization is described by a hysteresis \n\nloop, similar to the one exhibited by the ferromagnetic materials [155]. Ferroelectric \n\nhysteresis shows the nonlinear relation between the polarization (P) (on Y axis) and \n\napplied electric field (E) (on X axis) presented in Figure 2-14. When an electric field is \n\napplied to a ferroelectric material, the dipoles begin to align in the direction of the applied \n\nfield, this phenomena is also know as switching. When saturation polarization (Ps) \n\nreaches the maximum value and do not further increase with the increase in applied field, \n\na maximum number of domains are aligned in the direction of the applied field. If the \n\nfield is reduced to zero, the polarization values will decrease, but do not fall to zero, at \n\nthis point the polarization value lower than Ps known as the remanent polarization Pr \n\n(shown in Figure 2-14). To reduce the value of polarization to zero, it is necessary to \n\napply a field in the opposite direction. The field at which polarization reaches to zero is \n\ncalled coercive field (Ec) and at this point all the domains are randomly oriented (as \n\nshown in Figure 2-14). If the applied field is further increased in the negative direction \n\ndomains start to oriented in the direction of applied field and attain maximum \n\npolarization, also known as saturation polarization Ps, but in this case with a negative sign \n\n(-Ps). When the electric field is reduced again to zero, there is again a remanent \n\npolarization but in the negative direction (-Pr). Further increase of the field will bring the \n\npolarization back to +Ps and this creates the loop as shown in Figure 2-14. This loop is \n\nknown as the ferroelectric hysteresis loop. The spontaneous polarization of ferroelectrics \n\nis used to store data in FeRAM as a encoded \"0\"s and \"1\"s (binary number for digital \n\ncomputing), as illustrated in Figure 2-14. Since no external field is required to maintain \n\nthese states once reached, the memory device is known as non-volatile i.e. when the \n\npower is switched off the information is kept saved. Commercially FeRAMs use \n\nferroelectric thin films (90 -200 nm) because they have low coercive field and can be \n\nswitched from one spontaneous polarization state to other with the application of ~ 3 to 5 \n\nV. In order to miniaturize FeRAMs without affecting the properties, considerable efforts \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n37 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nare required to improve the fabrication techniques, explore new nano materials and new \n\ndesigns.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-14 Hysteresis loop of ferroelectrics, where Ps and, Pr are spontaneous \n\npolarization and remanent polarization, respectively (adapted from [184]). \n\n2.4.1 Crystal structure of ferroelectrics \n\nIn general ferroelectrics have four crystal structures, namely: \n\n1. Tungsten-bronze  \n\n2. Perovskite (oxygen octahedral, ABO3) \n\n3. Pyrochlore  \n\n4. Bismuth layer-structure  \n\nFrom all the above structures materials that depict the perovskite structure are by \n\nfar those that possess better properties and commercially more in use [185]. Some of the \n\nmost important compositions having a perovskite-type structure are BaTiO3, PbTiO3, \n\nPb(ZrxTi1-x)O3, (Pb1-xLax)TiO3, Pb(Zn1/3Nb2/3)-PbTiO3 (PZN-PT), Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)-\n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n38 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nPbTiO3 (PMN-PT) and KxN1-xNbO3 (KNN), which represent the bulk of ferroelectric \n\nceramics manufactured in the world today. \n\nAn ideal perovskite has a centrosymmetric structure with a cubic space group \n\nPm3m and chemical formula ABO3, where A\n2+ and B4+ atoms are cations and O2- the \n\nanion. The perovskite crystal structure can be described based on either a body centre \n\ncubic (BBC) and face centre cubic (FCC) lattice. In case of BCC lattice, the perovskite \n\nstructure consists of twelve oxygen ions (O-2) placed at the middle of all the edges of a \n\ncube and A2+ ions placed at the centre of the unit cell surrounded by four B4+ ions placed \n\nat each corners. In case of FCC lattice, the perovskite structure consists of B4+ ions at the \n\nbody centre position surrounded by six oxygen ions (O-2) at the face centre positions and \n\nA2+ ions occupy all the four corner positions (Figure 2-15 (a)) . Perovskite structure with \n\ncubic symmetry are at the non-polar state where A, B and O ions coincide, depicts no \n\npolarization (P = 0). When the A and B ions are displaced from their position with respect \n\nto O2-, a net polarity of the lattice (P ? 0) is established (Figure 2-15 (b)) [155]. Moreover, \n\nmany different cations can be substituted in both A and B sites of the perovskite to \n\nimprove the physical response of the materials, namely the electrical properties [186]. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-15 (a) Ideal perovskite structure at temperature above Tc, (b) below Tc a non-\n\ncentrosymmetric structure results in the B site atom displacement, where aC, aT, cT, are \n\nthe length of the unit cell, where suffix C and T stand for cubic and tetragonal structures, \n\nrespectively [184]. \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n39 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nThe ideal perovskite structure is rarely obtained at ambient temperature/pressure \n\ndue to the strict constraints placed by the ionic sizes. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor, \n\nt [187], based on the geometrical packing of charged spheres, can be used to describe the \n\ndistortion of the perovskite structure from the ideal configuration, by the following \n\nequation: \n\n \nt =\n\nrA +  rO\n2(rB +  rO)\n\n \nEquation 2-10 \n\nwhere rO, rA and rB are the ionic radius of the O, A and B site ions. Figure 2-16 depicts \n\nlist of compounds with t value from 0.95 to 1.08. For t = 1, the cubic paraelectric phase \n\nis stable. For t > 1, since the B-site ion is too small for its site, it can shift off-centre, \n\nleading to the occurrence of a displacive-type ferroelectricity in the crystal; BaTiO3 and \n\nPb(Zr,Ti)O3 are some examples. For t &lt;1, perovskite oxides are in general not \n\nferroelectrics, but exceptions are found for Bi based materials (e.g. BiFeO3), in which \n\nlarge A-site displacement is observed that results in ferroelectric behaviour.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-16 Distribution of ferroelectric oxides based on tolerance factor (adapted from \n\n[188]). \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n40 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n2.4.2 Ferroelectric phase transition \n\nA ferroelectric material can undergo a phase transition adopting a non-polar \n\ncentrosymmetric structure at a temperature called Curie temperature (TC). Above TC, with \n\nthe loss of the polar structure, the material does not exhibit spontaneous polarization and \n\nit is said to be paraelectric. Below TC, due to the appearance of the spontaneous \n\npolarization and to the mutual interaction between the dipoles, which causes a significant \n\nincrease of the local field, the material exhibits ferroelectricity. The structural phase \n\ntransition from the paraelectric to the ferroelectric phase is reversible. Near TC due to a \n\ndistortion in the crystalline lattice as the phase structure changes, the thermodynamic \n\nproperties, including dielectric, elastic, optical, and thermal constants show an anomalous \n\nbehaviour; the permittivity raises, reaching a maximum at TC [189].  \n\nThe theoretical explanation for the phase transition is the concept of a soft mode, \n\nwhich was proposed by W. Cochran et al. [190]. According to which, the ferroelectric \n\norder is based on the instability of a transverse vibrational mode, referred to a soft mode \n\nor a ferroelectric mode. Blinc et al. [191] have reported detailed lattice dynamic \n\ncalculations for several ferroelectric crystals and more rigorous mathematical treatments \n\nof the soft mode in ferroelectrics. In the proximity of TC the crystalline lattice is also soft \n\nand can be strongly polarized with a relatively small coercive field, this results in very \n\nhigh permittivity values for some ferroelectrics near TC. This phenomenon is generally \n\nknown as a dielectric anomaly. The temperature dependence of the dielectric permittivity \n\nabove TC can be described by a simple law called the Curie-Weiss law [192] given by \n\nfollowing equation:  \n\n \n? =  ?o +  \n\nC\n\nT ? Tc\n \n\nEquation 2-11 \n\nwhere C is Curie Weiss constant. \n\n2.4.3 Ferroelectric domains \n\nWhen a ferroelectric material is cooled down from the paraelectric state to the \n\nferroelectric one, there is the formation of uniform aligned electric dipoles in certain \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n41 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nregions of the crystals; regions that are known as ferroelectric domains. These \n\nferroelectric domains are formed in order to minimize the electrostatic energy of the \n\ndepolarization field (Ed) and the elastic energy associated with mechanical constraints. \n\nAt the transition temperature, with the onset of the spontaneous polarization there is t he \n\nformation of surface charges, the field due to this surface charge is known as a \n\ndepolarization field. The direction of the depolarization field is opposite to the direction \n\nof spontaneous polarization (Ps) (Figure 2-17 (lower half of the image). Depolarization \n\nfields occur in regions where non homogeneous distribution of the spontaneous \n\npolarization takes place such as at the surface of the crystal, at grain boundaries where \n\nthe direction of the polarization in neighbour grains is in the opposite orientation. \n\nDepolarization fields (mV/m) can be so high that they may affect the single domain state \n\nof ferroelectrics [186, 193, 194]. The electrostatic field associated to the depolarization \n\nfield can be minimized by splits into ferroelectric domains with oppositely oriented \n\npolarization, this resulting in the formation of 180o domains; or alternatively the \n\ndepolarization charge is compensated by electrical conduction with the surrounding \n\nmaterials.  \n\nThe formation of domains in ferroelectrics also occurs due to mechanical stresses \n\nas illustrated in Figure 2-17 (upper half of the image). Assuming that part of the crystal \n\nis under compression in one direction, as it is cooled down through the phase transition \n\ntemperature, in order to minimize the elastic energy associated with the compression \n\nstress, polarization develops perpendicularly to the direction of the stress, where in \n\nunstressed region the polarization may remain parallel to the stress direction, this \n\nresulting in the formation of 90o domains. \n\nDomain walls therefore separate regions in which polarization oriented is \n\nantiparallel (180\u00ba-walls) or perpendicular (90\u00ba-walls) to each other. Both 90 and 180\u00ba \n\ndomain walls may reduce the effects of the elastic strain and depolarization electric fields. \n\nIn a real scenario when crystal cools through the ferroelectric phase transition it undergoes \n\na combination of electric and elastic boundary conditions and results in the formation of \n\ncomplex domain structure with an interplay of 90\u00ba and 180\u00ba walls. Domain walls with \n\norientations that differ from the spontaneous polarization are called ferroelectric domain \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n42 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nwalls and those with orientations that differ from spontaneous strain tensor are called \n\nferroelastic domain walls [184]. \n\nIt was understood from above description that the directions along which the \n\npolarization will develop depend on the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions \n\nimposed on the material. The type of domain walls formed in ferroelectric materials \n\ndepends on the non-ferroelectric and ferroelectric phase of the crystal. In the \n\nrhombohydral crystal, the direction of the polarization occurs along the body diagonal \n\n(111) direction. This leads to the formation of 180\u00ba, 71\u00ba and 109\u00ba domain walls with eight \n\npossible direction of the spontaneous polarization. Fousek and Janovec [195] derived a \n\nmathematical expression which gives the possible criteria by which it is possible to \n\npredict the type of domain walls existing in ferroelectric materials.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-17 Schematic illustrating the phenomena of domains formation: (upper part) \n\nformation of 90o and 180o domains due to mechanical stresses, (lower part) formation of \n\n180o domains due to electric field, during the cooling down from high temperature to \n\nlower temperature in a crystal, where aC, aT, cT, are length of unit cell, where suffix C \n\nand T for cubic and tetragonal structure, respectively.

These properties \n\nare of great interest in a vast range of applications. Pyroelectrics are useful for imaging \n\nand thermal detection applications where as piezoelectrics are used in electromechanical \n\ndevices, such as sensors and actuators. In particular in microelectromechanical systems \n\n(MEMS), the large piezoelectric coefficients of ferroelectric solid solutions such as PZT \n\nallow for novel miniature electromechanical devices [196]. In the last three decades, the \n\ndevelopment made in the ferroelectric fabrication and processing of ceramics and thick \n\nand thin films for integrated\u2013circuit applications have served to keep the industry growing \n\nto the current maturity [160]. Ferroelectrics in the form of bulk are used in dielectric \n\ncapacitors, infra-red (IR) sensors, piezo sensors and actuators, electo optic shutters and \n\nelectro optic displays. In form of films they are used in Nov-volatile memories, as a buffer \n\nlayer for FET, integrated optics and reflective coatings. Figure 2-18 illustrates the \n\npossible use of ferroelectrics in form of bulk ceramics and/or films. More details on \n\nferroelectric application are out of the context of this work and can be found in reference \n\n[160]. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-18 Various application fields of ferroelectric oxides ceramics and films are \n\nidentified in the flow chart [160]. Abbreviations used in the figure are ML (multilayer), \n\nPTC (positive temperature coefficient), IR (infra-red) and AR (anti-reflective). \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n44 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n2.4.5 Ferroelectric memories  \n\nThe ferroelectric hysteresis is a unique characteristic of ferroelectrics that can be \n\nexplored from the practical point of view (described above). A ferroelectric material with \n\na square hysteresis loop has stable remanent polarization (Pr) values for small changes of \n\nthe electric field (E) and the switching of polarization occurs for high applied electric \n\nfields. These are ideal features for the binary code and NV-FERAMs (as stated above).  \n\nIn 1951, Dudley Allen Buck [197] proposed the use of ferroelectrics as Random \n\nAccess Memory (RAM) in his master thesis. At that time ferroelectrics started to be \n\nconsidered as promising candidates, however lack of reliability, fat igue of the switching \n\ncycles, imprint (the shift of the hysteresis loop along the origin axis due to self-\n\npolarization), high operation voltages and leakage currents limited their practical \n\nimplementation. Magnetic and later semiconductor memories were used [198]. More \n\nrecently, due to the ability to prepare high quality films (epitaxial grown, defect free and \n\nwith controlled stoichiometry) a renewed interest in ferroelectric memories appear. The \n\nwork on the development of ferroelectrics as RAM started in late 1980\u00b4s and the concept \n\nwas proved in 1991 at NASA\u00b4s Jet Propulsion Laboratory [199]. In the 1990\u00b4s a FeRAM \n\nconsisted of two transistors - two capacitors (2T - 2C) with the storage capacity of 512 b \n\nto 16 kb. The first FeRAM with capacity of 256 b using one capacitor - one transistor (1T \n\n\u2013 1C) was demonstrated in 1994 [200]. In order to compete with magnetic Dynamic \n\nRandom Access Memory (DRAM) there was a need to increase the storage capacity and \n\nreliability of the signals and to miniaturize the device. Many efforts have been carried out \n\nto shrink the FE memory cell and new architectures and circuits/devices technologies \n\nhave been developed. The major breakthrough came with the development of chain \n\nFeRAM in 1997. The first prototype of 16 kb chain FeRAM was fabricated in 1999. This \n\nwas followed by 8 Mb in 2001 [201], 32 Mb in 2003[202], 64 Mb in 2006 [203] and 128 \n\nMb in 2009 [204]. The average cell size including blocked selector region (region \n\ncombined with memory cell and transistor) has been shrunk from 13 to 0.32 mm2. 128 \n\nMb FeRAM consists of 90 nm thick PZT film in a capacitor cell to store the information \n\nbased on remanent polarization (discussed above) [204].  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n45 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nTable 2-1 illustrates the development of chain FeRAM with capacity and design \n\nrule (layout rules required to obtain optimum yield of the device without compromising \n\ncircuit reliability). This development leads to improve the scope of usage of FeRAMs in \n\nvarious memory devices as illustrated below [205]. \n\nThe continuous development made it plausible to use ferroelectrics in commercial \n\nmemory devices, especially in the low power consumption devices such as smart cards. \n\nSince then different companies such as Ramtron, Fujitsu Ltd., Texas Instruments, \n\nSamsung, Sony, among others have been working on the fabrication and development of \n\nthe FeRAM.  \n\nThe commercial available FeRAMs are Fujitsu 8-kb made of PZT used in Sony \n\nplay station 2, 32 Mb PZT FeRAM fabricated by Samsung and 4 Mb FRAM by \n\nMatsushita made from strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) [206]. Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3, \n\nBFO), one of the true single phase multiferroic materials, is used for FeRAMs by Fujitsu \n\n[207]. \n\nApplications of non-volatile memories include a display of highly consumable \n\nmultimedia equipment (digital cameras, video cameras and digital audio) and portable \n\nproducts (mobile phones, notebooks, Palm PCs, among others) [155]. A comprehensive \n\nreview on FeRAMs can be found in reference [208]. \n\nFurther miniaturization of FeRAMs is still an area of active research as suggested \n\nby the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) for NV-FeRAM \n\n(non-volatile FeRAM) (Table 2-2) [209]. According to this road map the cell structure \n\nwill go from planar (2D) to a three dimensional designs (3D) using nano structures such \n\nas nanotubes, nano trenches, among others and capacitor size of 0.08 \u00b5m2 or below up to \n\nfew nano meter dimension. There is also need to look for materials with high current \n\ncaring capacity such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, in order to replace expensive \n\nmetal electrodes.  \n\nTwo fundamental questions are raised here: i) one more scientific and related with \n\nthe need to know if ferroelectricity will still exist at the nano scale, and ii) a second one \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n46 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nmore technological and related with the existence of available technologies that will allow \n\nto fabricate the required nano size geometries. \n\n \n\nTable 2-1 Development of chain FERAMs as a function of capacity [210]. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe answer to the first question about the existence of ferroelectricity at nano  \n\nscale is addressed in the next sub section with a comprehensive literature review on the \n\ntopic and the answer to the second one related with the fabrication techniques is addressed \n\nin section 2.6. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n47 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \n\nTable 2-2: International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS), suggest \n\npotential solutions for future non-volatile memory [3]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.6 Scaling of the ferroelectrics \n\nEffect of size on ferroelectric properties of nano structure ferroelectrics \n\nAs indicated before, further improvements in terms of storage capacity are \n\nneeded; these can be accomplished by miniaturization of the cell size into nano \n\ndimensions and/or the development of new nano structures based on nanotubes, nanorods \n\nor nanowires as described by J. Scott et al. [211]. These 1D structure seems to be the new \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n48 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\ndirection for decreasing the existing size of memory devices. So it is pertinent to know if \n\nat nano scale ferroelectrics preserve ferroelectricity; i.e are there size effects in the \n\nferroelectric response of nanostructures? How quantum effects affect the ferroelectric \n\nbehaviour? What are the mechanisms responsible for the modification of ferroelectricity \n\nat the nano scale. Indeed, it is well accepted now, that properties of a material can \n\ndrastically change at the nano scale due to quantum confinement effects. New properties \n\nhave been even discovered for many nano sized materials. The effects of size reduction \n\nin the ferroelectric properties have been also addressed from the experimental and \n\ntheoretical point of view. \n\nSize effects in ferroelectrics have two distinct origins: intrinsic and extrinsic. In \n\nterms of intrinsic effects contributing to the ferroelectric instability phenomena to be \n\nconsidered are: depolarization phenomena [212], the absence of long-range cooperative \n\ninteractions, elastic constraints and new ferroelectric polarization. In terms of extrinsic \n\neffects to be considered are: domain structure, free carriers, lattice defects and interface \n\nphenomena [213-217]. \n\nTheoretical determination of the stability of the spontaneous polarization with the \n\ndecrease of size was given by Landau theory [218] and by Ab Initio models [219-221]. \n\nGhosez and Rabe et al. [221] studied the critical thickness for PbTiO3 films using \n\natomistic simulation and first principle calculations. The authors found that in (001) films \n\nwith thickness as low as three unit cells (~1.2 nm) the ferroelectricity persist. Later, \n\nJunquera and Ghosez [219] determined the critical thickness using first principle on more \n\nreal scenario where interface between the BaTiO3 thin films and the metallic electrodes \n\n(SrRuO3) was taken in to  account. The authors found that BaTiO3 thin layers lose the \n\nferroelectric properties below 24 \u00c5 (2.4 nm), due to the depolarization electrostatic field.  \n\nTo verify the theory on the critical thickness several systematic experimental \n\nstudies were carried out on powder particles of different sizes [222, 223] and thin films \n\n[224-226]. Here we present the most important works on experimental evidences for the \n\npersistency of ferroelectric properties for nano particles and thin films. Later, \n\ncomprehensive details on the existence of ferroelectric ordering in nanotubes and nano \n\nrods is also discussed. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n49 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nIshikawa et al. [223] determined the critical size for PbTiO3 nano particles below \n\nwhich ferroelectricity might not exist, using Raman and XRD. Raman results indicate that \n\nthe critical size is ~ 10.7 nm below which Raman scattering was not observed. Whereas, \n\nthe c/a ratio determined by XRD pattern indicates critical thickness of 11.7 nm. According \n\nto the authors the critical size effect is due to the weakening of dipole-dipole interaction \n\nwith the decrease in particle size. The experimental difficulties to fabricate small size (> \n\n10 nm) constrain the experimental investigation on critical size effects in ferroelectrics. \n\nHowever, this constrain has been overcome and critical size of particles was studied for \n\n~5 nm BaTiO3 particles by Polking et al. [227]. High quality mono domain BaTiO3 (BT) \n\nparticles prepared by hydrothermal method were studied by aberration corrected \n\ntransmission microscopy with holographic polarization imaging and piezo force \n\nmicroscope (PFM). The maps of ferroelectric structure distortions indicate the persistence \n\nof a linearly ordered and monodomain polarization at nano dimension. Further, the \n\nswitching of mono domains for 5 nm BT particles were proved by PFM. These results \n\npoint the way to fabricate ferroelectric memories with the storage capacity of multi-\n\nTbit/in2. From these studies it can be concluded the ferroelectric critical size for particles \n\nis well below 5 nm.  \n\nThe first experimental proof for the existence of ferroelectricity for thin films \n\ncame from the work of Tybell et al. [225]. Epitaxial Pb(Zr0.2Ti0.8)O3 (PZT) thin films, \n\nwith thickness from 800 to 40 \u00c5 (up to 10 unit cells) were grown on Nb-doped SrTiO3 \n\nmetallic single crystal substrates by off centre RF sputtering. Using scanning probe and \n\nelectric field microscopy the ferroelectric state was found for PZT films of 40 \u00c5 (4 nm to \n\n10 unit cells). Fong et al. [228] studied critical thickness for ultra-thin films of PbTiO3 \n\nsynthesised by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on SiTiO3 substrate. \n\nFilms with thickness of 4 to 12 nm were studied by synchrotron x-ray scattering maps in-\n\nsitu (during the growth of films) as a function of temperature. The satellite peaks obtained \n\nfrom the in plane domains were used to study the ferroelectric transition as function of \n\ntemperature. Satellites peaks persist down to 12 \u00c5 (approximately three unit cells). This \n\nresult seems to indicate that the effect of depolarisation in theory is overestimated. Indeed, \n\nin theoretical studies 180\u00ba domains were not considered however they were present in the \n\nexperimental samples and it is well known that this domain configuration produces a \n\nnatural mechanism (described above) for reducing the depolarising fields across the \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n50 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nthickness of the film. It is clear from the experimental results that stable ferroelectricity \n\nexists in nano particles and thin films up to 5 nm and 1.2 nm, respectively.  \n\nVarious theories have been used to investigate the ferroelectric behaviour and \n\ncritical thickness for 1D ferroelectrics [229-242]. Here, we described the most relevant \n\nworks. \n\nEbenezer and Ramesh theoretically evaluated the percentage of piezoelectric-\n\nresponse on the cylinder structure (such as nanotubes) having diameter of 5 mm and \n\nlength of 10 mm using finite element methods. The result proved that the polarization lay \n\nalong the long axis z or radially through the wall, but piezoelectric response around the \n\ntube circumference (?) was not calculated. \n\nEuler-Lagrange equation was used by Morozovska et al. [230] to derive the \n\nanalytical expression for dependence of paraelectric-ferroelectic transition temperature \n\non the radii of nonotubes, while considering the influence of effective surface tension and \n\ndepolarization field. In their studies they found the enhancement of spontaneous \n\npolarization for BaTiO3 and Pb(Zr,Ti)3 nanotubes and the noticeable increase of transition \n\ntemperature which the authors suggest to be due to the radial stresses coupled with \n\npolarization via electrostriction effect.  \n\nGeneste et al. [232] used the first principle calculation and found that the critical \n\nthickness below which ferroelectric distortion does not exist for BaTiO3 nanowires is \n\nabout 1.2 nm. The authors suggested that the disappearance of distortion is due to low \n\ncoordination at the wire surface. Later in 2008, Hong et al. [234] used Landau-Ginzburg-\n\nDevonshire theory to study the ferroelectric properties for Pb(Zr0.5Ti0.5)O3 nanowires. It \n\nwas proposed that Curie temperature, coercive field, remanent polarization, dielectric \n\npermittivity and piezoelectric coefficient are size dependent. These properties disappear \n\nbelow the critical thickness (2 nm) but can be recovered if appropriate axis tension is \n\napplied. The same authors studied the size dependent ferroelectric properties for BaTiO3 \n\nnanowires using the same theory. They found the Curie temperature, polarization and \n\nwidth of the ferroelectric loops decrease with the reduce diameter of the noanowires \n\nbelow 20 nm. The critical thickness for BaTiO3 where hysteresis loop disappear is \n\nestimated to be 3.6 nm [235]. The effect of the surface curvature of PbTiO3 nanowires \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n51 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nwas also theoretically studied [238]. The nanowires depict enhancement of spontaneous \n\npolarization due to the tension induced by nanowires surface curvature at the surface. \n\nThis induced tension counteracts the surface depolarization and PbTiO3 nanowires with \n\n1.8 nm diameter depicts 1.26 times higher spontaneous polarization than bulk counterpart. \n\nThe effect of surface termination for BaTiO3 [236] and PbTiO3 [237] nanowires \n\nwere also theoretically investigated. It was found that the critical thickness for BaTiO3 \n\nnanowires regardless of stoichiometry and nanowires side wall termination is about 12 \u00c5. \n\nHowever, the nanowires with Ba-O termination depict polarization below critical \n\nthickness. In the case of PbTiO3 nanowires the ferroelectricity is enhanced at the edge of \n\nthe Pb-O terminated nanowire because Pb-O covalent bond that predominates \n\nstrengthened ferroelectric distortions locally. Whereas, it is found considerable \n\nsuppression of ferroelectricity for Ti-O terminated nanowires. Critical thickness for \n\nPbTiO3 nanowires with Ti-O termination is around 17 \u00c5. Zheng et al. [240] use \n\nthermodynamic models and Ginsburg - Laudau equation to determine the effect of surface \n\ntension and the near \u2013surface eigenstrain relaxation on the ferroelectric properties. The \n\nauthors found that the transition temperature and polarization are enhanced due to the \n\neffective radial pressures induced by the surface tension. This results in high remanent \n\npolarization and coercive field in comparison with bulk values for BaTiO3 nanotubes. Ma \n\net al. [239] use Landau\u2013Ginzburg\u2013Devonshire phenomenological approach to investigate \n\nthe surface tension associated internal pressure on the phase transition in BaTiO3 \n\nnanowires. The surface tension inside 1D structures induces the internal pressure along \n\nthe radial direction which influences the ferroelectric properties. It was concluded that if \n\nthe polarization is oriented along the axis of the nanowires the polarization and transition \n\ntemperature are expected to increase with the decrease in diameter, until the long \u2013range \n\nordering favouring ferroelectricity. In the case of polarization normal to the axis of the \n\ntubes transition temperature decreases with diameter. \n\nFrom the theoretical point of view it is somehow clear that the critical size of 1D \n\nstructures to present ferroelectricity is dependent on many factors as size, polarization \n\ndirection, stress at curvature, termination and so on. Hence it is difficult to predict or \n\nindicate an exact critical size; however from the above mentioned works, the maximum \n\ncritical size theoretically calculated for 1D ferroelectricity is estimated to be around ~3 \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n52 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nnm. A clear picture on the critical size can be obtained if one considers experimental \n\nstudies, as well. \n\nIn last decades, experimental studies have been carried out on 1D nano \n\nferroelectrics to understand the existence of ferroelectricity and domain formation in \n\nnanowires, nanotubes and nanorods and also to verify the theoretical predictions. Here, \n\nwe detailed the most important experimental investigations carried out accordingly. \n\nThe first experimental investigation about ferroelectric properties on BaTiO3 \n\nnanowires prepared by solution based methods was carried out in 2002 [243]. The \n\nferroelectric properties were investigated by Electron Force Microscope (EFM) on \n\nBaTiO3 nanowires having diameters ranging from 10 to 35 nm. 10 nm BaTiO3 nanowires \n\nretain ferroelectric properties and depict a coercive field of ~7 kV/cm and retention time \n\nfor the induced polarization >5 days.  \n\nIn 2003 Morrison and co-workers obtain nanotubes of strontium bismuth tantalate \n\n(SBT), BT and PZT with wall thickness of ~200 nm, using Si porous template assisted \n\nchemical solution deposition (CSD) [211, 244, 245]. SBT and PZT tubes exhibit good \n\nrectangular hysteresis loops acquired by SPM [246]. \n\nNanorods of Rochelle salt (RS) single crystals were synthesised inside alumina \n\ntemplates with pore size of 30 nm by Yadlovker et al. [247]. The electrical measurements \n\nwere carried out by Sawyer-Tower circuit from temperature ranges from 21 - 60 \u00baC. They \n\nfound there is an enhancement of the spontaneous polarization from 0.25 up to 2 \u00b5C/cm2 \n\nin nanorods as compare to bulk.  \n\nIn 2006, Zhaoyn et al. [248] characterized BaTiO3 nanowires synthesised by \n\nchemical based methods  having diameter of 50 - 200 nm and length up to 10 mm. PFM \n\nstudies were carried out both in plane and out of plan mode. The authors have found that \n\nthe ferroelectric polarization switching along the axis of nanowire, whereas ferroelectric \n\nresponse normal to the axis was strongly suppressed. In the same year Spanier et al. [213] \n\ninvestigated the ferroelectric phase transition in BaTiO3 nanowires synthesised from \n\nsolution-phase decomposition of barium titanium isopropoxide. In this case BaTiO3 \n\nnanowires have diameters ranging from 30 to 100 nm with lengths up to 10 \u00b5m. The \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n53 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\ninfluence of depolarization fields on the stability of written domains perpendicular to the \n\nnanowire axis was demonstrated by Electrostatic Force Microscopy and the enhancement \n\nof ferroelectricity was attributed to the presence of molecular adsorbents on the surface \n\nof the wires. Curie temperature (Tc) variation as a function of the nanowire diameter is \n\nshown in Figure 2-19. Based on the experimental results it was predicted that the Curie \n\ntemperature for BaTiO3 nanowires falls below room temperature for nanowire with \n\ndiameter of 3 nm and ferroelectricity can be retained in the BaTiO3 nanowires up to 0.8 \n\nnm below the room temperature. The suppression of ferroelectricity for nanowires with \n\ndecrease in diameter is the result of the depolarization fields as it is known that the \n\ndepolarization is an inverse to the thickness of the material. \n\nFocused ion beam was used by Schilling et al. [249-251] for the synthesis of \n\ndifferent sizes of 1D BaTiO3 structures. The domain study on these 1D BaTiO3 structures \n\nwere carried out after cooling the wires below the Curie temperature and imaged by \n\nScanning Tunnelling Electron Microscopy. The authors found that the orientation of \n\npolarization exists both in parallel and vertical axis of the nanowires. By changing the \n\naspect ratio of the wires, it allows local variations of the polarization direction.  \n\nNanorods of PbTiO3 with width of 30-100 nm and length of 100\u00b4s nm were \n\nfabricated by hydrothermal method and characterized by Piezo Force Microscope. These \n\nrods exhibit ferroelectric hysteresis loops with the applied dc bias of \u00b110 V. The \n\norientation of the domains can be altered from perpendicular to parallel by heating the \n\nnanorods above Curie temperature. Heat treatment also results in the formation of 90\u00ba \n\ndomains what might be caused by the rearrangement of the surface as stated by the authors \n\n[252].  \n\nThe above studies suggest the size is not a constraint for 1D nano structures and \n\npossess sufficient ferroelectricity along the axis of 1D structure as well in the \n\nperpendicular to axis.  \n\nIn 1984 Ginzburg et al. [253] theoretically predicted that anomalies in magnetic \n\nresponse of CdC and CuCl are due to the presence of toroidal ordering and this ordering \n\ncan be found in ferroelectric material as well. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n54 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nFu et al. [254] investigated BaTiO3 colloidal quantum dots and wires using first \n\nprinciple based approach. They found that large ferroelectric off centred displacement \n\nexists in 5 nm nanodots, where ferroelectric domain ordered in spontaneous vortex \n\nordering. This theoretical demonstration of spontaneous toroidal moment open the \n\npossibility of fabricating high density ferroelectric memory based on spontaneous \n\ntoroidal moment. Later, Naumov and co-workers [6, 255] used ab initio studies to \n\ninvestigate the ferroelectric behaviour of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 nanodisks and nanorods. \n\nNanodisks of 3.2 nm diameter show the structural stability at low temperature and \n\npossess spontaneous polarization in the form of clockwise and anticlockwise vortices \n\n(Figure 2-20) which is not similar to the bulk. The toroidal movement and TC for \n\nnanorods increases with diameter at low temperature where in the case of nanodiscs TC \n\nis insensitive to the diameter. The authors also explained numerically that there is a \n\ncritical diameter under which vortex do not exist. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-19 Ferroelectric phase transition temperature (TC) as a function of the diameter \n\nof BaTiO3 nanowires (dnw). The solid circles are the experimentally determined TC and \n\nmagenta solid line is the fit to the data. The inset plots TC as a function of 1/dnw [213]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n55 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n  \n\nFigure 2-20 Schematic of the possible polarization phenomena pattern that occurs at the \n\nnano scale (a) circular and [6] (b) toroidal spontaneous moment [256, 257]. \n\n2.5 CNTs and ferroelectrics \n\nA key requirement for the miniaturization of FeRAM capacitor cell (or memory \n\ncell) is to have large electrode surface area so that reliability of the switching and sensing \n\nof the signals can be improved. These requirements cannot not be achieved in the present \n\n2D planar structure. Therefore, alternative structures and circuit designs are needed. 3D \n\ntype structures appears as a promising alternative. It is expected that these 3D capacitor \n\ncells for FeRAMs will allow to fabricate RAMs with the storage capacity of 1 - 10 Gbit \n\nwithout exceeding the total area of the memory cell i.e. more than 0.08 \u00b5m2 [258, 259]. \n\nThis means that the memory cell should be of lateral dimension of 100 nm or less up to \n\n20 nm. \n\n3D FeRAM cells can be design by two different approaches based on the design \n\nof bottom electrode (BE) [4]. The schematic of the two designs that are currently being \n\nproposed are represented in Figure 2-21; the first one is named as pin shaped (Figure 2-21 \n\n(a)) and the second one as cup shaped (or trench). In pin shaped the BE is deposited on a \n\nflat substrate and shaped in the form of rods or tubes. These tubes are then conformally \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n56 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\ncovered with the ferroelectric material and top electrode (TE). In the cup shaped geometry \n\n(Figure 2-21 (b)) the BE is shaped in the form of a trench that is later covered with the \n\nferroelectric and on the top of it with the TE. The whole cell size needs to be less than 10 \n\nF2 (where F is feature size) to accumulate the high storage density. \n\n  \n\nFigure 2-21 3D FeRAM capacitor cell: (a) pin shaped and (b) cup (or trench) shaped \n\n[4].  \n\nThe major developments on 3D shaped FeRAM capacitors have been mainly \n\nperformed by three different research groups. The group of Funakubo from Japan used \n\nsilicon trenches to fabricate 3D FeRAM capacitor cells [258, 260]. The group of Wouters \n\nfrom Belgium used pin shaped bottom electrodes covered with strontium bismuth \n\ntantalate (SBT) [261-263]  and the third group of Scott from United Kingdom and Katiyar \n\nfrom USA used CNTs as a BE for the synthesis of 3D capacitor cells [13, 21].  \n\nCup (or trench) shaped bottom electrodes were first investigated by Funakubo et \n\nal [260] in collaboration with Samsung-Tokyo Institute of Technology (Figure 2-22). The \n\nauthors used SiO2/TiAIN/Ti/SiO2/Si trench substrates as a bottom electrode for the \n\nfabrication of 3D shape FeRAM capacitors. By pulsed\u2013metal organic chemical vapor \n\ndeposition (MOCVD) Si trenches were coated with Ru electrode followed by the \n\nferroelectric layer of PZT by pulsed-MOCVD at 540 \u00baC. SEM and EDS analysis \n\nevidenced the good conformal covering of Si trenches with Ru and PZT, demonstrating \n\nthe success of using MOCVD to fabricate trench bottom electrode capacitor cells for high \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n57 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\ndensity FeRAMs. However, this work reveals some concerns about the variation of the \n\nPZT composition throughout the structure and thickness of PZT layer in the trench. \n\nKim et al. [258] did similar investigations on the fabrication of 3D capacitors \n\nusing Si trench, but in this case atomic layer deposition (ALD) was the chosen technique. \n\nSi trenches were covered with ~ 15 nm layers of Ir conducting electrodes using TiAlN as \n\nbuffer layer between the PZT and Ir which improves the stability of Ir electrodes. The \n\nferroelectric PZT layer deposited after by MOCVD depicted a uniform covering \n\nthroughout the trench with compositional uniformity of PZT throughout the trench. \n\nHowever, structural non-uniformity of the PZT layer on the bottom and on the side walls \n\nwas observed by TEM. \n\nThese results are preliminary investigations on using Si trenches as templates for \n\nthe fabrication of 3D capacitors; more systematic investigations using different FE \n\nmaterials and electrical characterization are necessary to be carried out. \n\nIn 2003, pin shaped electrodes were first investigated by Zambrano et al. [4] in \n\nSTMicrelectronis. The authors illustrates the pin shaped electrodes have some advantages \n\nover cup shaped ones because there is no need of uniform covering of BE with FE, \n\nmoreover no need of masking required during the deposition process of BE and/or FE \n\nand the size of the capacitor cell was not controlled by parasitic components as in trench \n\nshape cells. In this work Zambrano and co-workers used MOCVD to cover \n\nPt/IrO2/Ir/TiAlN (BE) with strontium bismuth tantalate (SBT) (Figure 2-23 (a)). \n\nHowever, structural non-uniformities of SBT grains were found at the bottom electrode. \n\nIn following works [261-264] this same group fabricated SBT films on pin shaped \n\nPt/IrO2/Ir/TiAlN (BE) with the technology node of 0.35 \u00b5m and 0.18 \u00b5m using MOCVD. \n\nA 70 % increase in the remanent polarization was reported for these 3D capacitors in \n\ncomparison with similar 2D capacitor cells due to the contribution of the sidewalls of BE \n\n(Figure 2-23 (b)). The authors also found that remanent polarization values increase with \n\nthe miniaturization of the cell size as illustrated in Figure 2-23 (c). These 3D capacitor \n\ncells show fatigue after 1013 cycles. \n\nThese innovative works clearly show that the use of 3D structures results in \n\nimproving polarization of 3D capacitors due to the increase in the surface area of the \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n58 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nbottom electrode. These findings triggered the further research with the use of metallic \n\n1D materials with enhanced conducting properties such as CNTs, to fabricate 3D \n\ncapacitor cells for future 3D FeRAMs. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-22 SEM micrograph of 3D trench shaped capacitor, Si trench covered by PZT \n\nfor 3D capacitor cell for FeRAM (left side image).

[14, 16, 17] in which the potential of using vertical \n\naligned CNTs coated with Si3N4 targeted to the development of ultra large scale \n\nintegration (ULSI) memory based on DRAM or nano electromechaical RAM \n\n(NEMRAM) was proved. The working principle of NEMRAM memory is based on the \n\nmechanical movement of the nanotubes, due to the charging of capacitor as in DRAM. \n\nThe main advantage of vertical structure design using CNTs is to decrease the cell \n\ndimension and improve the storage capacity. CNTs were vertically grown by CVD on the \n\nsubstrate and then coated with Si3N4 layer by direct current plasma enhanced chemical \n\nvapor deposition system (DC-PECVD) (Figure 2-24 (a)).  \n\nLater in 2007, based on a similar idea Kawasaki et al. [13, 21] have employed \n\nCNTs as bottom electrodes for the development of pin shaped 3D capacitors cells for \n\nFeRAM. In this work CNTs were vertically grown on silicon substrates and vertical \n\nMWCNTs were coated with PZT by liquid source misted chemical deposition (LSMCD) \n\n(Figure 2-24 (b)). After PZT deposition on MWCNTs the samples were pyrolysed at 300 \n\n(c) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n61 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n\u00baC for 3 min followed by annealing at 650 \u00baC in oxygen atmosphere. TEM and STEM \n\nstudies show that the tubes are not uniformly coated and also that the MWCNTs did not \n\nburn due to the protective coating of the oxide on the top of the tubes. However, EDS \n\nanalysis clearly reveals the contamination of CNTs surface with platinum. These studies \n\nwere the initial step and proved the feasibility of producing CNTs \u2013 FE structures. In \n\nthese studies the ferroelectric behaviour of CNTs-FE was not demonstrated.  \n\nFollowing this pioneer work, Katiyar and co-workers demonstrated the covering \n\nof Bamboo\u2013CNTs (BCNT) (diameter of 100 to 150 nm) with pulsed laser deposition \n\n(PLD) method at low oxygen pressure of 70 to 80 mTorr and temperature ranges from \n\n600 oC to 700 oC with ferroelectrics as PZT and Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 (BST) [27] and \n\nferromagnetic La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 [31]. PZT on the surface of BCNTs was analysed by \n\nRaman that confirms no damage to the BCNTs up to 650 \u00baC and confirms the formation \n\nof crystalline PZT at 650 \u00baC. However with the increase in the deposition temperature to \n\n700 \u00baC, no RAMAN peaks corresponding to BCNTs were observed, point to the possible \n\ndisappearance of BCNTs by oxidation. The structural morphology of the PZT grown on \n\nBCNTs studied by HRTEM depict nano sized crystal beads of PZT across the CNTs \n\n(Figure 2-25 (a)). PZT layer thickness on the surface of CNTs is varying from 50 to 80 \n\nnm. The local piezoelectric response shows ferroelectric behaviour of 1D BCNTs-PZT \n\n(Figure 2-25 (b)) [28, 29]. The leakage current maps were also obtained using conduction \n\nAFM reveals the variation in conductivity throughout the structure. According to author \n\nthis may be associated with the presence of defects associated with the fabrication. BST \n\ndeposited on BCNTs by PLD at 650 \u00baC with oxygen pressure of 80 mTorr were \n\ncharacterized by HRTEM and Raman [27]. HRTEM analysis shows the BST-BCNTs \n\nstructure has diameter of 150 to 250 nm. BST layer consists of maize like nano beads \n\nhaving thickness of 15 to 25 nm. Raman analysis confirms the presence of BCNTs with \n\nlittle damage fabricated at 650 \u00baC. No electrical measurements were performed on the \n\nBST covered BCNTs structure. Later, the same group deposited La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 \n\n(LSMO) [31] on CNTs using PLD. The thickness of the LSMO layer on the surface of \n\nMWCNTs is ~50 nm. The in-situ I-V measurement in TEM and modelling of the data \n\nstates the electron transport properties of LSMO-BCNTs outperform those from CNTs \n\nalone. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n62 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nYang et al. [25] fabricated co-axial nano structures (or core shell) of MWCNTs \n\nand oxides using PLD. CoFe2O4 layers on MWCNTs were deposited by PLD followed \n\nby BT layers. The authors found that increasing the deposition temperature (above 700 \n\n\u00baC) and oxygen concentration (100 mTorr) improved the crystallinity of BT but the \n\nsurface morphology of the tubes becomes affected at these conditions. No electrical \n\nmeasurements were reported. \n\n  \n\nFigure 2-24 (a) MWCNTs coated with Si3N4 for NEMRAM [15] and (b) MWCNTs coated \n\nwith PZT by liquid mist technique [21]. \n\n  \n\nFigure 2-25 (a) HRTEM micrograph shows nano beads of PZT on the surface of PZT \n\ncoated MWCNTs.

This \n\nleads to lower the drifting of electron flows in CNTs and thus reduce electron phonon \n\nscattering and Joule heating. No information is disclosed on structure or interfaces of \n\nMWCNTs-SrTiO3. The possible application of this heterostructure was proposed for field \n\nemission devices such as X-ray generation, and wave amplification application.  \n\nThe above mentioned works use physical/chemical vapor deposition methods to \n\ncover CNTs with FE, but there are some reports on use of chemical solution deposition \n\nmethods to cover MWCNTs with FE detailed below. \n\nThe first work on the use of chemical methods to cover MWCNTs with FE was \n\nreported in 2010, where Bedekar et al. [23, 24] reported coatings of MWCNTs with \n\nBaTiO3 (BT). The BT layer on the surface of MWCNTs was formed by dispersing the \n\nCNTs in to the commercial sol gel solution of BT. MWCNTs covered with BT precursor \n\nwere heat treated in nitrogen atmosphere at 700 \u00baC for 2 h to obtained MWCNTs covered \n\nwith BT layer. HRTEM and EDS revealed uniform covering of tubes with layer thickness \n\nfrom 10 to 20 nm. However in this study information on oxide phase formation process, \n\ncrystallinity and electrical measurements are lacking.  \n\nMohammadi et al. in 2012 [26] used MWCNTs as sacrificial templates for the \n\ngrowth of PZT nanotubes. Here, MWCNTs were coated with PZT sol gel solution and \n\nannealed at >450 \u00baC for different time periods to oxidized MWCNTs. Without \n\nexplanation the authors stated that the presence of MWCNTs promoted the early PZT \n\nphase formation. The activation energy for the PZT phase formation was calculated by \n\nKissinger equation and found to be 103 kJ/mol. TEM analysis demonstrate the formation \n\nof PZT tubes with thickness of 50 to 60 nm. Electrical measurements were not performed \n\non these PZT nanotubes.  \n\nVertical aligned MWCNTs were covered with BST particles using low cost \n\nelectrophoretic deposition (EPD) process for 3D capacitor cell. Commercial Ba1-xSrxTiO3 \n\n(BST) nano particles (average size of 10 nm) were used for the deposition in aqueous \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n64 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nmedia. Vertical aligned MWCNTs synthesised by CVD were used as a working \n\nelectrodes and deposition of BST particles were carried out with electric fields of 5 V/cm \n\nand 100 V/cm [22]. Although BST particles covered MWCNTs, a non-uniform surface \n\nof BST granules on the MWCNTs is the main limitation of this fabrication process. The \n\nelectrical properties of these MWCNTs-BST structures were not measured. \n\nOther than covering CNTs with FE there are other studies which are focused on \n\nthe fabrication of MWCNTs-FE composites for various electrical application. Here are \n\nsome of the most important ones, which are somehow related with the present work.  \n\nHydrothermal synthesis was used to fabricate MWCNTs-BT composite structures \n\nin which MWCNTs were used as metallic fillers to improve the thermal and electrical \n\nproperties of the composites [18, 19, 266]. The MWCNTs-BT composites were \n\nhydrothermally synthesised in two steps. In the first step TiO2 was initially immobilized \n\non the surface of MWCNTs using sol gel method. These MWCNTs-TiO2 structures were \n\nreacted with barium acetate solution to get MWCNTs-BT composite powders. [18-20] \n\nUsing these powders MWCNTs-BT sintered bulk ceramics with different wt% of \n\nMWCNTs were fabricated by spark plasma sintering (SPS). Composite depicts decrease \n\nin thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity from 3.06 to 2.46 W/mK and 20.3 to \n\n6.5 S/cm, respectively, whereas specific heat capacity increases from 425 to 465 mJ/gK.  \n\nIn 2008, Ruangchalermwong et al. [267] synthesised MWCNT-PZT thin films on \n\nPt (111)/TiO2/SiO2/Si(200) substrates by spin coating. The films were prepared by mixing \n\ndifferent wt% (0 to 1) of MWCNTs in the PZT sol. The deposited films were pyrolysised \n\nat 400 \u00baC for 2 h and then annealed at 650 \u00baC for 30 min. During the annealing process \n\nMWCNTs oxidized and leave open porosity. The effect of porosity on the dielectric \n\nproperties of porous PZT films was investigated. As expected it was found that the \n\ndielectric response degrades with the increase of porosity.  \n\nTable 2-3 and Figure 2-21 summarizes the above literature review and the most \n\nimportant contributions to this field of covering of MWCNTs with ferroelectrics up to \n\nnow. In the Figure 2-21 the green ovals and square represent the major aim and specific \n\naims for the present work carried out.  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n65 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nMost significant progress on covering MWCNTs with FE has happened in last \n\nfive years; most of this work relates with covering MWCNTs for 1D structure by \n\nphysical/chemical vapor deposition methods and just a few studies are related to the use \n\nof chemical solution deposition methods; \n\n-except the work of Kumar et al. [29], no other works studied the ferroelectric \n\nproperties of the CNTs-FE. \n\n-there are no systematic studies on the coverage of MWCNTs with low cost \n\nchemical solution methods has been reported, especially for BFO.  \n\n-it is clear that developing and understanding the covering process of CNTs with \n\nFE is an important aspect for 3D FeRAM capacitors. \n\nFrom the above discussion it is clear there is need to pursue this idea and to \n\ndevelop techniques by which the short come of previous studies can be overcome, such \n\nas stoichiometry control, carbon lattice damage and siphoning of the using CNTs as a \n\nsubstrate material.

Indeed novel properties expected for many nanostructures, nano  \n\nmaterials and nano devices and the market needs for small, smart and mobile electronic \n\ngadgets have been the driving force behind these developments. Extensive efforts have \n\nbeen on going to prepare nano particles, ultrathin films, nanowires, nanotubes and 3D \n\narrays of nano structures. Among all of these, 1D nano structures and their arrays as 3D \n\nstructures are been seen as highly promising to be used in various electronic applications, \n\ndue to their electron caring capacity, large surface area and high strength. As mentioned \n\nbefore, 1D nano structures are expected to play a prominent role as interconnectors, 3D \n\nmemories cells, as a gate material for transistors, in optoelectronics and as \n\nelectrochemical and electromechanical devices with nano scale dimensions, among others \n\n[206, 268]. \n\nSo far fabrication strategies can be divided in to two main groups: top down and \n\nbottom up approach. \n\nIn top-down methods the feature size is obtained by etching or removal of \n\nmaterials from a large surface. The methodology mainly relies on lithography processes \n\nthat utilize highly energised particles such as photons, ion or electron beam to erase \n\nmaterial. Top down methodologies employ physical methods such as lithography, \n\netching, ball milling and probe-based methods to downsize large macro structure to micro \n\nsized ones. The main advantage of top down methods comprise high-precision \n\npositioning and size control and disadvantages include: effect the crystallographic \n\norientation of the materials, introduced impurities and imperfections and time [269]. \n\nIn the case of bottom up approaches the nano structures are fabricated from the \n\natomic level to the molecular one, as building blocks, up to a nano or micrometre size. As \n\na consequence, advantages of the bottom up processes include better chances to obtain \n\ndefect free nano structures, high homogeneity in the structure, epitaxy and possibility to \n\nbe used for coatings; the main disadvantages of bottom up approaches include: toxicity \n\nof precursors, difficulties in controlling uniformity of size and morphology of the nano \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n68 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nstructures and complexity of the process in some cases. Table 2-4 summarises the most \n\ncommon top down and bottom up approaches used for the fabrication of ferroelectric \n\nfilms and nano structures with their advantages and disadvantages [270]. \n\nTable 2-4 List of top down and bottom approaches and their advantage, disadvantages \n\nand limitations, adapted from [270] \n\nApproach Technique Advantages Disadvantages Minimum \n\nsize (nm) \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nTop-Down \n\n \n\nFIB \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEBDW \n\n \n\n \n\nEB-lithography \n\n \n\nHigh resolution, Use of High \n\nquality films, Uniform size and \n\narray \n\n \n\nNo etching process, High \n\nresolution and Uniform size \nand array \n\n \n\nHigh resolution and uniform \n\nsize and array \n\n \n\nSurface damage, Low \n\nthroughput, Volume \n\nshrinkage, Shape \n\nchange \n\nLow throughput, \n\nEtching process \n\n \n\n \n\nLow throughput, \n\nEtching process \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n\n70 \n\n \n\n \n \n\n100 \n\n \n\n[259, 271-274] \n\n \n\n \n\n[271, 275-277] \n\n \n\n \n\n[278, 279] \n\n \n\nBottom-up \n\n \n\nCSD (solgel, \n\nhydrothermal) \n\n \n\n \n\nMOCVD \n\n \n\n \n\nPLD \n\n \n\n \n\nSputtering \n\n \n\nEasy Process, Easy to generate \n\nvarious size and to access \n\nextremely small size \n\n \n\nEasy Process, Easy to generate \n\nvarious size and to access \n\nextremely small size \n\n \n\nEasy process, Access to \n\nextremely small feature \n\n \n\nEasy process, conformal \n\ncoating \n\n \n\nDifficulty in uniform \n\nsize array, and shape \n\n \n \n\nDifficulty in uniform \n\nsize array, and shape \n\n \n\n \n\nDifficulty in uniform \n\nsize array, and shape \n\n \n\nDifficult in uniformity \n\n \n\n \n\n<10 \n\n \n\n \n\n<10 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n<10 \n\n \n\n \n\n<10 \n\n \n\n \n\n[224, 271, 280-\n\n287] [288, 289] \n\n \n\n \n\n[271],[282],[290],\n\n[291, 292] \n\n \n\n[271, 282] \n\n \n\n \n\n[30, 293] \n\n \n\nTop-down approaches mainly rely on lithography processes that utilizes highly \n\nenergised particles such as photons, ions or electron beam to remove material. Within \n\nthese methodologies the most important techniques used to fabricate ferroelectric nano \n\nstructures are Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Electron Beam Direct Writing (EBDW). \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n69 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nThese techniques are currently used in modern commercial nano technology, because \n\nthey provide high-precision positioning and excellent size control [294]. The working \n\nprinciples of these techniques are described below. \n\nThe working principle of FIB is based on bombardment of high energy ions on \n\nthe surface in order to remove the atoms. In FIB the Gallium ions are generated form the \n\ngallium metal placed in contact with tungsten needle. The produced gallium ions are \n\naccelerated towards the samples using electrostatic lenses with the acceleration energy \n\nfrom 1 - 50 keV. FIB is carried out under high current (~4 nA) to remove the material up \n\nto sub-micrometres to nanometre [295]. FIB has the same experimental setup as scanning \n\nelectron microscope except in the case of FIB focused beam ions (namely gallium ions) \n\nare used instead of electrons. FIB is one of the most popular techniques for the fabrication \n\nof ferroelectric nano structures from already deposited metal organic crystalline films. 70 \n\nnm FE nano structures can be fabricated from FIB. FIB can be used in three different \n\nways for micro fabrication, named as FIB lithography, FIB milling and FIB deposition \n\nmilling. The main advantages of FIB are: high resolution, uniform size and the ability to \n\nfabricate arrays. Low throughput and high cost are however major limitations. \n\nAs an example, Ganpule et al. [259] successfully demonstrated the use of FIB to \n\nachieve ferroelectric nano structures with sizes ranging from 1 to 0.01 \u00b5m2 of \n\nPb1.0(Nb0.04Zr0.28Ti0.68)O3. A protective layer of Pt is coated on the top LSCO electrode \n\npreviously deposited on Pb1.0(Nb0.04Zr0.28Ti0.68)O3 film (Figure 2-27 (a)). FIB ion beam \n\nwas operated with an acceleration voltage at 50 kV, dose of 8 x 1017 ions/cm2 and beam \n\nspot size of 6 - 12 nm to fabricate nano structures as small as 100 nm. The obtained \n\nferroelectric nano structures show ferroelectric hysteretic response. However, there are \n\nmajor concerns regarding the damage of the oxide lattice at the etching surface by the \n\nhigh energy electron milling. Therefore, it is not possible at this stage of the technology \n\nto obtained feature sizes below 70 nm, for which ferroelectric oxides will not damage. \n\nE-Beam Direct Write (EBDW) is a massless lithography process used to fabricate \n\npatterns of metallic and oxide nano structures using metal organic precursors [296]. It \n\nuses electrons as a source for patterning the surface of the substrate covered with the metal \n\norganic precursors. Chemical reactions are locally induced in a metal-organic film by \n\nirradiation the film with the electron beam. The unexposed area is dissolved by etching \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n70 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nor firing process and further heating at high temperature yields nano pattered structures \n\nof metal or oxides. A feature size around 20 nm can be achieved by this process. This \n\ntechnique is widely used for making photo masks for integrated circuits [296]. However, \n\nEBDW is not economically viable to make patterns, besides being very time consuming, \n\nthe fabricated nano structures are highly defective.  \n\nAlexe et al. [275] used EBDW to fabricate SrBi2Ta2O9 and Pb(Zr0.70Ti0.30)O3 nano \n\nstructures; the experimental steps followed during this process are shown in Figure 2-27 \n\n(b). The metal organic films of Pb(Zr0.70Ti0.30)O3 and SrBi2Ta2O9 on SrTiO3/Nb substrates \n\nwere exposed to the electron doses varing from 600 to 1500 mC/cm2 and 600 to 1200 \n\nmC/cm2, respectively. The films were then immersed in toluene for 1 min and dried with \n\nnitrogen. Nano structured patterns (as shown in Figure 2-27 (b)) were obtained with \n\nlateral dimensions between 1 and 0.125 \u00b5m. After this the substrates were heat treated to \n\nobtained crystalline nano structures of Pb(Zr0.70Ti0.30)O3 and SrBi2Ta2O9  ferroelectric. \n\nThe local ferroelectric switching proved the ferroelectric nature of 100 nm \n\nPb(Zr0.70Ti0.30)O3 nano structures. \n\nBottom up approaches are divided into three categories i) Physical Vapor \n\nDeposition (PVD) and ii) Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and iii) Chemical Solution \n\nDeposition (CSD). \n\nIn PVD process a vapor phase from a pure material is created by laser ablation or \n\nion bombardment. This vaporized material condenses on the substrate to create the \n\ndesired ferroelectric layer. In the case of CVD, the source material, in the form of volatile \n\nprecursors and together with the carrier gases are injected into the CVD chamber, where \n\nthe vaporized precursors adhered to the hot substrate, eventually undergoes chemical \n\nreaction and leaves the desired ferroelectric oxide layer on the substrate. Both PVD and \n\nCVD are widely used in microelectronic industries to fabricate thin film based devices \n\n[297, 298]. \n\nIn comparison to the previous PVD and CVD, Chemical Solution Deposition \n\n(CSD) methods are high-throughput, well suited to the deposition of large areas and low \n\ncost. Due to these assets CSD has recently started to be used in the industry to fabricate \n\nferroelectric thin films and/or nano structures. In CSD process liquid precursors of desire \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n71 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nmaterial are transferred/deposited on the substrate to form films and or nano structures of \n\nferroelectrics [299, 300].  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-27 Top down methodologies for the fabrication of ferroelectric nano structures: \n\n(a) focused ion beam milling (FIB) and (b) EB direct writing [259, 275]. \n\nImportant processing methods used for the fabrication of ferroelectric nano \n\nstructures by PVD are Pulse Laser Deposition (PLD) and sputtering. Within CVD \n\nmethods, Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD), because it combines \n\nchemical reactions at the gas phase, has a prominent place. In what concerns CSD \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n72 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nmethodology sol gel and hydrothermal are some of the most versatile methods to fabricate \n\nferroelectric nano structures at low costs and low temperature. \n\nPLD involves ablating a target material with a high energy focused laser beam to \n\nproduce a highly forward directed plasma plume (normal to the target surface) that \n\nsubsequently condenses and deposits onto the substrate. The PLD method is of interest \n\ndue to its relative simplicity when compared to other PVD techniques, its relative good \n\ncapacity to transfer stoichiometric amounts of the target material to the substrate, and its \n\nability to control the stoichiometry of the growing thin film with the aid of a background \n\ngas atmosphere. Usually an excimer or Nd-YAG laser, producing an intense pulsed \n\n(repetition rate 0-100 Hz) laser beam in the UV range, is used. Typical wavelengths are \n\n193 nm for ArF, 248 nm for KrF and 308 nm for XeCl excimer lasers and 355 nm for \n\nNd:YAG. For every material there exists a set of optimal deposition parameters that \n\nrequires some systematic previous work. The main advantage of PLD is related to the \n\npossibility of getting conformal covering and very small dimension structures (>10 nm). \n\nThe main disadvantage includes the difficulties in getting uniform size, arrays and shapes \n\n[301]. \n\nSputtering is also a PVD technique. It works on two modes, named as DC mode \n\nused to deposit metallic films mainly and Radio Frequency (RF) mode use for depositing \n\noxide films. The working principle of sputtering is based on the bombardment of a target \n\n(cathode) with high energy positively charged ions. In the sputtering chamber the inert \n\ngas is introduced at a pressure of 1 to 10 mTorr. A DC voltage is applied between the \n\ntarget (cathode) and the substrate (anode), which ionizes the inert gas and results in the \n\nformation of a plasma. The charged ions of the inert gas accelerate towards the target and \n\nthe forced collisions of the ions with the target results in the ejection of atoms from the \n\ntarget into the space. These ejected atoms move towards the substrate (anode) where they \n\ncondense to form a film. During the ionization of the inert gas the electrons are released \n\nand accelerate towards anode substrate. During electron journey to anode, it collides with \n\nthe inert gas and create more ions and electrons in the process, so that cycle of sputtering \n\ncontinues. Inert gases, as Ar and Xe, are used to form a plasma and prefer for the \n\nfabrication of metallic films [194]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n73 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nFor the deposition of oxide films RF sputtering is preferable because it can be \n\noperated in low gas pressure (&lt;1mTorr) at RF of 13.65 MHz, nevertheless the RF \n\nsputtering can be operated from 0.5 -30 MHz. In the RF sputtering a permanent magnet \n\nis fixed behind the target to accelerate the ionization process. With the application of \n\nmagnetic field parallel to the target surface, the secondary electrons drift in circular path \n\nvery near to the target surface. The advantage of RF sputtering is the plasma confined \n\nnear to the target without causing any damage to the film (on anode). As particles are \n\ndrifting in circular motion it increases the traveling distance and the probability of \n\nionization of the inert gas molecules. This process tends to generate large amount of ions, \n\ntherefore, increasing the efficiency of the sputtering process. Although sputtering \n\ntechniques are very good for growth of 2D films, there are limitations especially in what \n\nconcerns the control of the microstructure, crystal structure and stoichiometry for \n\ncomplex multicomponent systems. Moreover, it is implies the use of expensive \n\nequipment. For the synthesis of oxides, reactive gases such as nitrogen and/or oxygen \n\nmixed with argon are used. It is also possible to deposit multicomponent systems, but it \n\nrequires system and target modifications [302]. In the present work RF magnetron \n\nsputtering is used to deposit BFO film on the surface of aligned CNTs. The important \n\nparts of the sputtering unit used in the work are marked in Figure 2-28. \n\nMOCVD is a chemical vapor deposition process used to fabricate thin films and \n\ncoatings, especially for manufacturing III-V compound semiconductors and mainly based \n\non nitrates. MOCVD working principle is simple. Pure gases of the desired processed \n\nmaterial along with carrier gases are introduced into the CVD chamber by pumping. The \n\natoms of desired oxides are deposited on the substrate by decomposing organic molecules \n\nwhile they are passing over the hot substrate. The deposited atoms undergoes \n\ncrystallization process to form thin oxide film on the surface of substrate. MOCVD is \n\nused for manufacturing light-emitting diodes (LEDs), lasers, transistors, solar cells and \n\nother electronic devices, and is one of the key enabling technologies for future markets \n\nwith high growth potential [298]. The advantages of MOCVD process include a high \n\noutput and versatility to generate a wide range of sizes up to very small sizes&lt;10 nm, \n\nwhereas the disadvantages encompass difficulties to have uniform coverings and the use \n\nof toxicprecursors. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n74 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2-28 RF Sputtering unit from CRIOLAB, the important parts are marked with \n\ncircles.  \n\nSol gel processing is known as wet chemical method, through which nano sized \n\nparticles and/or thin films of simple and complex compounds can be obtained at the \n\nmolecular level (Figure 2-29). The term sol refers to a colloidal suspension of solid \n\nparticles of nano metric size, where gravitation forces are negligible and interactions are \n\ndominated by short range forces, like Van Der Walls [303]. The term gel is used to define \n\na porous three dimensional network of clusters or particles that result from the hydrolysis \n\nand condensation of the sol. \n\nThe steps involved in the formation of inorganic networks from a solution are \n\ndependent on the structure of the sol. Metal alkhoxides (M(OR)z, (where R is an alkyl \n\ngroup CxH2x+1, and Z is the oxidation state of the metal) and metal salts are the most \n\ncommonly used starting reagents for sol-gel processing of oxides.

This reaction can be described by a SN2 mechanism (bimolecular nucleophilic \n\nsubstitution) [305]. \n\nO\n??\n\n + M\n??\n\n -O\n??\n\n R \nH\n\nH\n \n\nO-M-O\n??\n\n R\nH\n\n??\n\nH\n \n\nHO-M-O\nH\n\n??\n\nR\n \n\nHO-M  + ROH \n\n \n\nThe reaction occurs with the nucleophilic addition of a negatively charged HO?- \n\ngroup on to positively charged metal M?+, leading to an increase of the coordination \n\nnumber of the metal atom in the transition state. The positively charged proton then \n\ntransferred towards an alkoxy group and the positively charged protonated ROH ligand \n\nis finally removed.  \n\nThe simple way of describing the whole reaction of hydrolysis and condensation \n\nis given below: \n\n M(OR)x + H2O \n \n\n?

In the second step (Equation 2-13), \n\nthe condensation between the hydroxyl and an alkoxide ligand or between two hydroxyl \n\nligands (Equation 2-14) results in the formation of a metal-oxygen-metal (M-O-M) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n76 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nbridge, which constitutes the backbone of any oxide  structure. Continuous condensation \n\nleads to increase in metal-oxygen-metal crosslinks, eventually results in gelation or \n\nprecipitation. \n\nThe final structure contains an inorganic network of oxygen bridged metal, \n\nhydroxyl and alkoxy groups [303, 306]. The network branching, molecular size and \n\nnumber of alkoxide groups depends on the reaction kinetics. In order to have small \n\nmolecules and precipitates it is advised to have a fast hydrolysis step.  \n\nOne of the claimed advantages of sol gel method is the possibility to synthesised \n\nnano powders and thin films at relatively low temperatures compared to solid state \n\nmethod. Some of the disadvantages of the sol-gel process include: relative high cost and \n\ntoxicity of precursors and solvents and crack formation in the case of thin films, resulting \n\nfrom the decomposition of the organics prior to the oxide formation. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-29 Sol-gel process to obatin different nano structure materials such as films, \n\nfibers, glass, ceramics xerogel and aerogel [307].  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n77 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nHydrothermal is a process by which fine organic or inorganic materials are \n\nobtained using single or heterogeneous phase reaction in aqueous media above room \n\ntemperature (T > 25 oC) and above atmosphere pressure. Synthesis is usually conducted \n\nabove the boiling temperature of the solvent, which results in the generation of an \n\nautogeneous pressure which is the saturated vapor pressure of the solution. This condition \n\nprovides optimum conditions to increase solubility and reactivity of the precursors used \n\nin the material synthesis. If water is used as the solvent the process is known as \n\nhydrothermal and when nonaqueous solvent is used it is known as solvothermal [308]. \n\nUpper limit of hydrothermal temperature and pressure used commercially are 1000 oC \n\nand 500 MPa respectively [299]. \n\nFigure 2-30 demonstrates the effect of filling factor (of teflon jar used for \n\nhydrothermal process) on the autogeneous pressure and temperature for water based \n\nprocess. The doted curve represents the line where the liquid and gaseous phase coexists. \n\nBelow this dotted line the liquid water is not present and the vapor phase is not saturated. \n\nThe compressed liquid phase is presented above the dotted line. The solid line represents \n\nthe pressure inside the vessel due to different filling factors. For example when the filling \n\nfactor is 70 % the vessel is completely filled with liquid water at a temperature of ~ 300 \n\noC, with the increase in temperature the pressure inside the vessel also increases and \n\nfollows the 70 % line [309].  \n\nThe properties of the water changed with the addition of mineralizers. This \n\nmineralizers are used to improve the solubility limits of different precursors, diffusion \n\nand reaction rate. The precursors used in hydrothermal synthesis also influence the \n\ncomposition of the liquid and gas phase equilibrium in the autoclave.  \n\nThe hydrothermal synthesis is an economical and environmentally friendly \n\nmethod to synthesised organic and inorganic materials with different shapes and sizes. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n78 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \n\nFigure 2-30 Pressure \u2013 temperature dependence for different degrees of filling of the \n\nautoclave with water during hydrothermal process [309]. \n\nThe nucleation and growth mechanisms of formation of oxides in hydrothermal \n\nsynthesis can be dissolution-precipitation [310] or phase boundary chemical reaction \n\n[311]. Dissolution-precipitation mechanisms involve the transportation of the solute \n\nthrough the suspension, surface adsorption and dehydration of the solute species, surface \n\ndiffusion between precursors and finally crystallite formation and growth (Figure 2-31 \n\n(a)). In dissolution-precipitation the solubility of the precursors is important and in some \n\ncases it might not be sufficient for the reaction process to occur. Therefore different \n\nprecursors with different reactivity should be used; for example in the hydrothermal \n\nsynthesis of BaTiO3, anatase has a higher reactivity than rutile. Not only precursors but \n\nalso pH is major factor, therefore different mineralizers needs to be added to increase the \n\nsolubility of the precursors. The choice of the optimal mineralizer should consider the \n\nchemistry of the oxide and precursor species needed to be dissolved. Strong bases (NaOH \n\nor KOH) have a high solubility under the hydrothermal synthesis conditions, therefore \n\nfrequently used [312]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n79 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\nThe phase boundary controlled mechanism occurs for the amorphous gels, \n\nexhibits a porous network structure, which is believed to be infiltrated by the aqueous \n\nsolute and solvent under hydrothermal conditions Figure 2-31 (b); because of that the \n\ndiffusion process is very rapid for the phase boundary mechanism in comparison to the \n\ndissolution- precipitation one. The nucleation of small particles occurs with the addition \n\nof basic solution followed by the growth at hydrothermal conditions. \n\nDifferent crystallite size and shapes can be obtain by controlling the various \n\nparameters, such as concentration of precursor in the solution, pH of the solution, \n\ntemperature and type of precursors. In order to obtained 1D nano structured materials \n\nwith anisotropic crystal structures, the appropriate organic additives or surfactants to aid \n\ndirected growth or 1D templates [313] are usually used. \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n80 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \n\nFigure 2-31 Schematic of (a) dissolution-precipitation and (b) phase boundary control \n\nreactions [310, 311]. \n\nHydrothermal synthesis is performed in stainless steel autoclaves as illustrated \n\nin Figure 2-32. The used precursors can be oxides, nitrates, hydroxides or other salts of \n\nthe desire material. The precursors, additives and mineralizers are added together with \n\nthe solvent in the teflon jar, before putting it into the stainless steel autoclave. The filling \n\nfactor of the teflon is always lower than 80%. Moderate temperatures in between 80 to \n\n300 \u00baC are used for the synthesis, which are lower than supercritical conditions. The \n\nheating time varies from system to system and can differ from 0.5 to 72 h. The \n\nhydrothermal synthesis is carried in teflon jars to avoid contaminations [309]. The \n\nfabricated powder is washed with water and in some cases with alcohols to remove the \n\nions deposited on the surface of the product. The advantages of hydrothermal methods \n\nover other methods are: use of low working temperature, the materials which have high \n\nvapor pressure near the melting point can be grown by hydrothermal method and \n\ndifferent shapes of the same material can be obtained. \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n81 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n \n\nFigure 2-32 Schematic of a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave, used for hydrothermal \n\nsynthesis [309]. \n\nThere are various different mechanisms and strategies by which 1D ferroelectrics \n\ncan be fabricated by CSD and can be classified as template assisted synthesis and template \n\nfree synthesis.  \n\nIn template assisted synthesis, 1D negative templates made of porous alumina \n\n(AAO, anodic aluminium oxide) and positive templates such as nanotubes, nanorods or \n\nnanowires are used to fabricate 1D nano structures. Sol-gel solution of the desired \n\ncompound is introduced into the pores or channels by capillary forces and/or use of \n\nvacuum pumps. This is followed by an heat treatment to obtained crystalline tubes similar \n\nto the geometry of the formation channels [314]. The template of AAO is removed by \n\nbasic solution such as NaOH, in some cases removed by heating the template at elevated \n\ntemperature Figure 2-33 (a)).  \n\nPositive templates has been used to fabricate 1D nano structures, the nano wires \n\nand nanotubes of ferroelectrics. Mohammadi et al. [26] used MWCNTs as a positive \n\nsacrificial templates to fabricate Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 nanotubes. MWCNTs covered with \n\nPb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 solution was heat treated at elevated temperature to obtained \n\nPb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 1D nanotubes with diameter of 80 to 100 nm.

The use of CNTs for non-sacrificial \n\ntemplate was described above in the work of Kumar et al. [29].  \n\nElectrospinning is also a template assisted synthesis in which the shape of the final \n\nnanofibre is confined by the shape and size of the nozzle. A viscous polymeric solution \n\nof the desired material is uniaxial stretched under an electrified jet to get thin fibres \n\n(Figure 2-33 (b)) [315]. Hollow fibres can also be produced using co-electrospinning \n\nmethod [316]. Alkoy et al. [317] used sol-gel based PZT solution and polyvinyl \n\npyyrolidone polymer to fabricate PZT nanofibres heating at 700 \u00baC. PZT fibres having \n\ndiameters ~230 nm were obtained from this process. \n\n \n\nFigure 2-33 (a) Template growth using AAO templates and (b) uniaxial stretching during \n\nthe electro spinning process for the fabrication of 1D ferroelectrics(adapted from [318]). \n\nIn template free method the 1D structures are formed due to kinetically favouring \n\nor controlling of crystallographic facets. Template free synthesis methods are better in \n\nmany aspects when compared with template methods, especially because no post \n\ntreatments are required. The most common mechanisms of template free growth are: 1) \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n83 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\ncrystallographic orientation preferences and 2) growth of preferential crystal facets by the \n\nuse of appropriate capping reagents.  \n\nIn case of materials with anisotropic crystal lattice. There is an energy differences \n\nbetween the crystal faces, faces with high surface energies show the fastest growth rate \n\nin contrast to others, resulting in 1D structures Figure 2-34 (a)). Orientated attachment \n\nfor piezoelectric ZnO was reported by Pacholski et al.[319]. 1D ZnO structures were \n\nformed by the attachment of the quasi-particles with perfectly allied lattice planes along \n\nc direction. The attachment between the particles occurred by the conventional \n\nmechanism of dissolution and growth. The other mechanism for the growth of 1D is \n\nadsorption of capping reagents on preferential surfaces of the crystal. These capping \n\nagents stabilized that surface triggering the differences in the growth rate between \n\ncapping and non-capping sites resulting in the formation of 1D structures Figure 2-34 \n\n(b)). Yang et al.[320] fabricated nanowires of BaTiO3 by hydrothermal method using \n\npolyethylene glycol (PEG) as a surfactant.

This limits the \n\ngrowth of the crystal to specific orientation resulting in the formation of 1D BT nanowires \n\nunder hydrothermal conditions.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2-34 Growth of 1D nano ferroelectric structures due to (a) use of anisotropic \n\ncrystallographic structure of a solid and (b) use of surfactant [318]. \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n84 \n\nFundamentals and state of the art \n\n2.7 Conclusions  \n\nThis chapter detailed important aspects related with the proposed work on the \n\nfabrication of CNTs-FE nano structures. It is evident from the literature that CNTs is the \n\noptimum material for microelectronics due to its extraordinary physical, chemical \n\nproperties and unique geometry. With the evolution of electronic world there is urgent \n\nneed to have high data storage devices which can be also achieve if FeRAM are redesign \n\nfrom capacitor planar structure to 3D one, as suggested by ITRS 2011. One way to \n\nachieve this 3D design FE capacitors is to combine CNTs with FE. However, this is not \n\na trivial task as mentioned above and, currently there are no systematic studies on the \n\nfabrication and characterization of CNTs-FE structures, and in particular exploiting the \n\nuse of low cost and low temperature synthesis methods. \n\nThis is the ground where this work is set, aiming to explore the potential of using \n\nlow cost, low temperature process to construct MWCNTs-FE nano structures and to \n\ncheck their ferroelectric behaviour towards potential applications, namely as FeRAMs. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n85 \n\nExperimental details \n\nChapter 3 \n\n3 Experimental details \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n86 \n\nExperimental details \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract  \n\nThis chapter describes the experimental strategy followed to fulfil the defined \n\nobjectives of this thesis. The materials under study include MWCNTs and as \n\nferroelectrics, Lead Zirconate Titanate (Pb1-xZrxTiO3, (PZT)) and Barium Titanate \n\n(BaTiO3) and as a multiferroic Bismuth Ferrite (BiFeO3). The synthesis techniques used \n\ncomprise low temperature chemical solution methods as sol gel and hydrothermal and \n\nphysical deposition, as RF sputtering. The different fabricated MWCNTs-FE structures \n\nwere characterized by a variety of techniques that include, X-Ray diffraction, thermal \n\nanalysis (DTA/TG), Infra-Red spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Scanning Electron \n\nMicroscopy (SEM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), High Resolution (HR) \n\nTEM, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Piezo Force Microscope (PFM). As received \n\nMWCNTs are impure, and for the purpose of this work MWCNTs were purified and \n\nfunctionalised. For each MWCNTs-FE system the particularities of the experimental \n\nprocedure are described in detail later in the corresponding chapters. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n87 \n\nExperimental details \n\n3.1 Introduction  \n\nThe experimental work carried out during this work is illustrated in Figure 3-1. In \n\nthis work two ferroelectric compounds (PZT and BaTiO3, BT) and one multiferroic \n\n(BiFeO3, BFO) were used to cover MWCNTs. In the first phase of the work and since \n\nferroelectrics usually require high crystallization temperature the thermal resistance of \n\nMWCNTs was studied as a function of temperature, heating rate and atmosphere. In the \n\nnext phase, MWCNTs were purified and functionalised. For that two different \n\nfunctionalization processes were used: covalent bonding and non-covalent bonding \n\nfunctionalization. Using these functionalised MWCNTs the combination between PZT, \n\nBT and BFO, as ferroics with MWCNTs was conducted using sol gel and hydrothermal \n\nmethods to obtain 1D ferroelectric structures. In the last phase of the work, BFO was \n\ndeposited on the Vertical Aligned (VA) MWCNTs using sputtering to investigate the \n\npotential use of VA-MWCNTs as conducting bottom electrodes. The physical properties \n\nof the nano structures were characterized by various techniques such as DTA/TG, XRD, \n\nRaman, FTIR, SEM and HRTEM. The electrical response for MWCNTs-FE were \n\ninvestigated by PFM.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3-1 Flow chart of the experimental strategy followed during this work. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n88 \n\nExperimental details \n\n3.2 Multiwall carbon nanotubes used in the present work \n\n3.2.1 As-received MWCNTs \n\nMWCNTs used in this work were synthesised at the University of Scientirarum \n\nSzegediensis (University of Szeged) in Hungry, by Chemical Vapor Deposition \n\nTechnique (CVD). Briefly, alumina supports impregnated with Co-and Fe-acetate \n\n(catalyst) were used as substrates to grow MWCNTs. The substrates are placed on quartz \n\nboats in the reaction chamber. In the first step, furnace and catalysts are degassed at 750 \n\n\u00baC in flowing nitrogen. After 30 min, the gas stream is changed for a mixture of acetylene-\n\nnitrogen and the catalytic chemical vapor deposition takes place for 1 h. At this stage the \n\nCNTs grown on the catalyst particles with amorphous carbon. After the reaction, the \n\nsystem is cooled under nitrogen flow. As prepared MWCNTs are removed from the \n\nalumina support by boiling in concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution [321]. \n\nThe thermal studies were performed on the as-received MWCNTs.  \n\nVertical aligned (VA)-MWCNTs grown on Si substrates with diameter and length \n\nof 5-20 nm and 1-2 mm, respectively, were also used to fabricate MWCNTs-FE \n\nstructures. VA-MWCNTs were purchased from CVD Materials Corporation, USA. They \n\nwere used to exploit the potential of CNTs as bottom electrode in order to replace the \n\nexpensive metal electrode such as platinum. \n\n3.2.2 Purification and functionalization of MWCNTs \n\nAs received MWCNTs contain impurities such as amorphous carbon, metal \n\nparticles and so on, that compromise the final properties of the MWCNTs. To remove the \n\nimpurities and to functionalize the tubes for improved wettability they were thermally \n\nand chemically treated. MWCNTs were functionalised both covalently and non-\n\ncovalently, as described below. \n\nThe steps followed for the purification of as-received MWCNTs are illustrated in \n\nFigure 3-2. As-received MWCNTs were cleaned by thermal heating at 350 \u00b0C for 1 h to \n\nremove the amorphous carbon and other chemical groups attached on the surface of the \n\ntubes. This was followed by a chemical refluxing step in 6 M of hydrochloric acid (HCl) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n89 \n\nExperimental details \n\nfor 6 h at 125 \u00baC; this resulted in the removal of metallic catalysts. The refluxed MWCNTs \n\nwere washed with deionized water using ultrasonic bath and repeated filtration until pH \n\ncome close to neutral. Vacuum filtration was performed using PVDF membrane filter \n\n(Membrane Solution) having diameter ~ 47 mm and pore size 0.22 \u00b5m. At the end of this \n\nstep purified MWNTs were dried at ~100 ?C overnight in the oven. This purification \n\nprocess removed almost all the carbonaceous (amorphous carbon) along with metal \n\ncatalyst particles. After this step MWCNTs are designated as purified MWCNTs.  \n\nThe purified MWCNTs were acid treatment with 5 M of nitric acid (HNO3) and a \n\nmixture of 5 M and 10 M of HNO3 and sulphuric acid (H2SO4) for different periods of \n\ntime. The nitric acid results in the functionalization of the tubes by induction of hydroxyl \n\nand carboxyl ion groups on the defect sites, whereas H2SO4 cuts the tubes into small \n\nsegments. In the present work, MWCNTs tubes functionalized with 5 M HNO3 where \n\nused for the fabrication of MWCNTs-FE structures. It was verified that functionalization \n\nwith mixtures of 5 M and 10 M of HNO3 and H2SO4 induced severe damages to \n\nMWCNTs and because of that tubes treated with this process were not further used in this \n\nwork. \n\nNon covalent functionalization was carried out on purified MWCNTs using \n\nSodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS, Sigma, ? 98.5%). The MWNTs (~300 mg) were dispersed \n\nin SDS aqueous solution (1:10 volume ratio) using ultra-bath sonicator for 2- 5 h. This \n\nsolution was further magnetically stirred overnight so that as much as complete reaction \n\nbetween SDS and MWCNTs occurs. The SDS functionalized MWCNTs were filtered \n\nand dried in oven for 24 h at 80 \u00baC. SDS functionalized MWCNTs are referred as \n\nSDSMWCNTs. The non-covalent functionalization is more conformal and has less \n\ndamage to the structure of MWCNTs. Figure 3-2 illustrate the steps followed for the \n\nfunctionalization of MWCNTs both covalently and non-covalently.  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n90 \n\nExperimental details \n\n \n\nFigure 3-2 Flow Chart illustrating the steps followed for the purification and \n\nfunctionalization of MWCNTs. \n\n3.3 Characterization techniques \n\n3.3.1 Contact angle  \n\nIn this work the wettability of the MWCNTs is an important aspect, since one \n\naims at the complete coverage of the tubes by the ferroelectric oxide. To measure the \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n91 \n\nExperimental details \n\nwettability of surfaces there are different methods (quantitative and qualitative) and \n\namong the quantitative ones, contact angle method is one of the best when pure fluids are \n\nused.  \n\nThe contact angle was defined for the first time by Thomas Young et al. [322], \n\nthe angle formed between the liquid drop contact with the solid surface where the \n\nmechanical equilibrium of the drop under the action of three interfacial tensions, namely \n\nliquid vapor (??? ), solid-vapor (??? ) and solid-liquid (??? ) given in Equation 3-1. The \n\nYoung equation for the contact angle (?) is given below. \n\n ??? ???? =  ??? ? ???  Equation 3-1 \n\nThe facile way to measure contact angle is a direct measurement of the tangent \n\nangle at the three phase contact point on a sessile drop profile also known as sessile \n\nmethod. The set-up used for measuring contact angle by sessile method is referred as \n\ntelescope-goniometer. It consists of a horizontal stage to mount the sample of interest and \n\na micro meter pipette or motor driven syringe is attached on the overhead of horizontal \n\nstage (as in the present work). A digital camera and illumination source are placed in both \n\nsides of the horizontal stage so that camera, horizontal stage and illumination source are \n\nhorizontally aligned. The water/liquid drop of desired volume is transfer to the surface of \n\ninterest and image is acquired after the drop come in stable configuration. The contact \n\nangle is measured between the solid-liquid interfacial tensions and liquid-vapor \n\ninterfacial tensions as shown in Figure 3-3. If the contact angle is >90o the surface has \n\npoor wetting, if it is equal to 90o then incomplete wetting and good wetting is obtained \n\nwhen ? is&lt;90o. The direct measurement of sessile drop contact angles with a telescope-\n\ngoniometer can yield an accuracy of approximately \u00b12\u00b0 [323].  \n\nThe contact angle was measured on purified and functionalized MWCNTs using \n\nsessile drop method (Dataphysics, OCA 25). A drop of water (~3 \u00b5l) is delivered on the \n\nsurface of MWCNTs films. The water droplet on MWCNTs is allowed to come in stable \n\nconfiguration before taking the images to measure contact angle using software (SCA 20) \n\nprovide with the equipment. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n92 \n\nExperimental details \n\n \n\nFigure 3-3 Contact angle (?) formed by sessile liquid drops shows the wettability of the \n\nsubstrate on (left) ? > 90 o poor wetting, (in middle) ? = 90 o incomplete wetting (right) ? \n\n&lt;90 o good wetting (adapted from [323]). \n\n3.3.2 Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) \u2013 Thermo gravimetric (TG) \n\nDTA and TG analysis are one of the most basic and powerful tools to evaluate the \n\nbehaviour of a material as a function of temperature. From the DTA and TG plots, various \n\ninformation can be extracted, among them: thermal stability, chemical and physical \n\nreactions (exothermic or endothermic), phase formation and transition, glass transition \n\ntemperature, melting temperature, among others. \n\nThe working principle of DTA is based on the heat loss or gain due to the \n\nstructural changes in material as a function of temperature or time. DTA equipment uses \n\ntwo set of identical columns, one for the reference (generally, empty alumina crucible) \n\nand other for the sample. Both the columns undergoes similar thermal cycle, while \n\nrecording any temperature difference between reference and sample by thermocouples \n\nequipped with in the chamber. This temperature changes occurs due to the endothermic \n\nor exothermic reactions taking place in the sample. A DTA curve provides vital \n\ninformation on the phase formation especially in case of ferroelectric oxide synthesis by \n\nchemical methods. This information can be used to synthesise material with the desire \n\nphase or can be used to predict the reaction evolution for the formation of oxide.  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n93 \n\nExperimental details \n\nThe working principle of TG is based on the weight change occurred as function \n\nof temperature or at isothermal conditions. The weight loss that occurs in amorphous gels \n\nprepared by solution are mainly due to the evaporation of water, solvents, releasing of \n\ncarbon dioxide and, in some cases, phase formation. In the particular case of carbon \n\nnanotubes, the weight change in ambient atmosphere is typically a superposition of the \n\nweight loss due to oxidation of carbon into gaseous carbon dioxide and the weight gain \n\ndue to oxidation of residual metal catalyst into solid oxides. TG and DTA data can be \n\nobtained simultaneous in the same equipment, under various atmospheres and various \n\nheating rates.  \n\nFor oxidation studies of MWCNTs and phase formation of ferroic oxides, DTA/ \n\nTG was performed in a SETARAM, Labsys, TG-DTA12. The samples were heated in \n\naluminum crucibles from temperature ranging from 80 oC to 900 oC in air at different \n\nheating rates (2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 oC/min). Base line was measured for all the experiments \n\nfor each heating rate and deducted from the calculated data for each analysis. \n\n3.3.3 X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) \n\nThe physical properties of all the solids are dependent on the crystal structure as \n\nis the case of FE. Therefore it is important to know the crystallographic structure of oxides \n\nunder study and how the crystallographic structure is affected by the preparation \n\nconditions, and presence of foreign elements such as CNTs (present work scenario). X-\n\nray diffraction is one of the most important and used characterization tool to study the \n\ncrystalline structure of materials. \n\nThe working principle of XRD is based on the diffraction of X-ray from Bragg \n\nplane. When a beam of X-ray interacts with the atom and electrons in the crystal, they \n\nwill oscillate under the X-ray impact and emit a large number of electromagnetic waves \n\nin particular directions. The direction of the emissions will be in phase in certain \n\ndirections, which depends on the incident X-ray (Figure 3-4), on the wavelength and on \n\nthe spacing between atoms in the crystals. The relation between all of these parameters is \n\ngiven by Bragg relation Equation 3-2: \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n94 \n\nExperimental details \n\n n? = 2d.sin? Equation 3-2 \n\nwhere n is an integer and ? is the wavelength of the x-ray used, d is the inter planar \n\nspacing, and ? is the angle made by the incident ray with the crystal plan.  \n\nDiffracted rays are detected by a diffractometer; the obtained diffraction patterns \n\nare then compared with the reference standards for identification. Each solid has its \n\nunique crystallographic characteristics and X-ray powder patterns can be used as a \n\n\"fingerprint\" for crystal identification. Once the material has been identified, X-ray \n\ndiffraction may be used to determine its crystalline or microcrystalline structure, i.e. the \n\nrelative orientation of atoms in the crystal or crystallite and interatomic distances. \n\nFurthermore, it is possible to determine the size of the crystallites using Scherrer equation \n\n[324]. \n\n \n\nFigure 3-4 X-ray diffraction from the Bragg plane of cubic crystal with path difference \n\nequal to 2d sin?, diffraction pattern is shown on the bottom right of the figure[325]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n95 \n\nExperimental details \n\nTwo sets of XRD equipment were used in the present investigation. For the phase \n\nidentification studies conducted at room temperature Rigaku diffractometer with Cu-K? \n\nradiation filtered by Ni was used. The diffraction patterns were acquired from 10 to 80\u00b0 \n\n(2?) with a step length of 0.04 \u00ba. For the in-situ phase formation studies as a function of \n\nthe temperature Philips X\u2019Pert diffractometer with Cu-K? radiation was used to analyze \n\nsamples for phase formation studies with temperature. In this case the diffraction patterns \n\nwere acquired from 10\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 (2?) with a step length of 0.02\u00b0.In order to obtain reliable \n\nquantitative data for kinetic analysis, the scan time and the samples weight were always \n\nthe same. Variable-temperature X-Ray diffraction measurements were performed using \n\nPanalytical X\u2019pert-Pro powder diffractometer equipped with an incident beam \n\nmonochromator (Cu K?1 radiation), Pixcel position sensitive detector, and Anton Paar \n\nTTK-450 temperature stage having an operating range from -190 \u00b0C to +1300 \u00b0C.  \n\n3.3.4 Vibration spectroscopy  \n\n3.3.4.1 FTIR Spectroscopy \n\nFTIR stands for Fourier Transform Infra-Red. As an infrared spectroscopy (IR), \n\nit gives information about chemical and bonding environment of the molecules. At room \n\ntemperature the organic molecules are always in motion. The energy of the molecules are \n\nquantized rather than continuous. This means the molecules can only stretch and bend at \n\ncertain allowed frequencies. When, molecules interact with the electromagnetic radiation, \n\nif the radiation frequency matches with the frequency of one of the vibrational modes, it \n\nwill absorb energy (in most cases) from the radiation and jump to higher energy state. \n\nThe difference between the lower vibration state and higher vibration state is equal to the \n\nenergy associated with the wavelenght of the radiation that was absorbed. This results in \n\nthe infrared spectrum as a function of transmission or absorption of energy. In a FTIR \n\nspectra the abscisa axis corresponds to the IR wavenumber, which are expressed in cm-1. \n\nThis is the number of waves in a length of one centimetre. The ordinate axis represents \n\nthe percentage of transmittance or absorbance, denotes the amount of light that was \n\nabsorbed at each frequency [326]. The wave number (? ?) is expressed by the following \n\nrelation given in Equation 3-3: \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n96 \n\nExperimental details \n\n ? ? =  \n?\n\n?\n=  \n\n?\n\n?\n Equation 3-3 \n\nwhere ? stands for the wavelength, c for the speed of light in vacuum (c = 2.997925 \u00d7 \n\n108 ms-1) and ? wave frequency. \n\nThere are different possible modes of vibration. The number of fundamental \n\nmodes of vibration of a molecule can be predicted by the degrees of freedom of the \n\nvibrational energy which for linear and non-linear polyatomic molecules containing N \n\natoms are 3N-5 and 3N-6, respectively [327]. The stretching vibration can be described \n\nby the movement when the bond length vary, and the bending vibration is the movement \n\nwhen one atom can move out of plane and so the bond angle is changed. Some bonds can \n\nstretch in-phase (symmetric stretching) or out-of-phase (asymmetric stretching). More \n\ndetailed description of modes of vibration is presented in Figure 3-5. \n\n \n\nFigure 3-5 Four vibration modes for molecues [328]. \n\nIn this work Fourier Transformed Infrared (FTIR) spectra in transmittance mode \n\nwas acquired with a Mattson Mod 7000. FTIR spectra in the range 400-4000 cm-1 was \n\nobtained from the pellets. The pellets were prepared by mixing the sample with KBr (150 \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n97 \n\nExperimental details \n\nmg) and pressed uniaxial with the pressure range from 10-20 MPa. The spectra is typically \n\nan average of 64 scans with 4 cm-1 resolution. \n\n3.3.4.2 Raman Spectroscopy  \n\nRaman spectroscopy was discovered by an Indian scientist C.V Raman for which \n\nhe was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in the year 1930. Raman spectroscopy is also \n\nknown as vibrational spectroscopy, it is used to study various modes such as vibration, \n\nrotation etc. in the system by means of inelastic scattering. Laser light is used as a source \n\nfor Raman spectroscopy in visible, infrared and near ultraviolet range. Laser light \n\ninteracts with the phonons from the sample and results in the shift of energy. These shifts \n\nin energy give the information about the electronic environment of the molecules [329].  \n\nThe working principle of Raman is based on the inelastic scattering of light when \n\ninteract with molecules. When a monochromatic light from the source interacts with the \n\nmolecules or bonds inside the sample it gives rise to different scattering phenomena, \n\nnamely Rayleigh, Stokes Raman and Antistoke Raman scattering. During this interaction \n\nthe photon excites the molecules from ground state to the virtual energy states (Figure \n\n3-6), where it stays for some time and return to the ground state in different or same \n\nvibration levels after emitting the photon. The molecule if excited from first vibrational \n\nlevel returns back to the same vibrational level then it is known as Rayleigh scattering or \n\nelastic scattering (no change in frequency of photons) (Figure 3-6). If the molecule returns \n\nto different vibrational level, then the difference between the original state and the new \n\nstate leads to a shift in the emitted photon's frequency, away from the excitation \n\nwavelength. When the photon frequency is shifted towards lower wavelength then it is \n\nknown as Stoke scattering, otherwise it is known as Antistoke scattering. Energy of \n\nscattered phonons is discrete for every bounding and electronic environment; therefore it \n\nshows typical frequency for all Raman active molecules [330]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n98 \n\nExperimental details \n\n \n\nFigure 3-6 Diagrammatic representation of an energy transfer model of Rayleigh \n\nscattering, Stokes Raman and Anti-Stokes Raman scattering, adapted from [329]. \n\nRaman spectroscopy gives very valuable information, which is useful for \n\nchemical identification, characterization of molecular structures, effects of bonding, \n\nenvironment and stress on a sample. Due to these features, Raman spectroscopy is widely \n\nused for polymers, oxide films, ceramics, and semiconductors and for the analysis of \n\nfullerene structures. \n\nRaman spectroscopy is most important tool for the characterization of MWCNTs. \n\nThe Raman spectra of MWCNTs usually exhibit two characteristic bands, the tangential \n\nstretching G mode (1500 -1600 cm-1) and the D mode (~1350cm-1). The D band is a \n\ndouble resonance Raman mode, which can be understood as measurement of structural \n\ndisorder coming from amorphous carbon and any defect. The G band originates from \n\ntangential in plane stretching vibration of the C- C bonds within the graphene sheets \n\nrelated with sp2 bounding. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands is represented by R \n\n(R = ID/IG, calculated from Raman spectra), can be used to evaluate disorder density of \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n99 \n\nExperimental details \n\nnanotube walls. The graphitized MWCNTs exhibit a lower value for R with an average \n\nof ~1.1 [331]. \n\nRaman spectra for isothermally heated MWCNTs were recorded on a Bruker RFS \n\n100/S FT Raman spectrometer using a 1064 nm excitation of the Nd/YAG laser. The \n\nspectra were collected on powder samples in a range of wavenumber from 100 and 2000 \n\ncm-1. However, for better resolution, the spectra was also acquired by HR 800, Jobin \n\nYvon spectrometer, using the excitation lines of 532 nm for MWCNTs-FE and \n\nMWCNTs. \n\n3.3.5 Electron microscopy  \n\nThe transmission electron microscope operates on the same basic principles as \n\nlight microscope but instead of light it uses electrons. The use of electrons as the light \n\nsource is related with its lower wavelength which gives high resolution, thousands of \n\ntimes better than light microscope. TEM works under high vacuum created by different \n\npumps such as ionic, diffusion and rotary pumps. \n\nTEM is divided into three main parts: the first one is the electron source, the \n\nsecond one is the column consisting of electromagnetic lenses, sample holder and aperture \n\nand the third one is the detector where one will have the final image (fluorescent screen) \n\n(Figure 3-7). The electrons are generated by three known mechanisms, field emission, \n\nthermionic emission and schottky emission. To guide these electrons through the column \n\nthe electromagnetic lenses are used that focuses the electrons into a very thin beam. The \n\nelectron beam then travels through the specimen to the detector where it gives the final \n\nimage [332]. \n\nThere are different image modes in which the TEM can work. The most common \n\nmode is bright field and in which TEM generally starts. In this mode, contrast is formed \n\ndirectly by blockage and absorption of electrons in the sample. Thicker regions of the \n\nsample or regions with a higher atomic number appear dark, whereas regions with no \n\nsample in the beam path appear bright, hence the term bright field. \n\nIn dark field mode the objective aperture (a metallic plate with different sizes of \n\nholes) is placed in back focal plane that blocks the direct beam from the interacted \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n100 \n\nExperimental details \n\nelectrons and allow only scattered electrons to produce an image, due to which the image \n\nappears to be dark. In this mode it is possible to identify if the particles are crystalline or \n\namorphous. The crystalline particles appear dark in this mode.  \n\nThe diffraction mode also known as selected area electron diffraction (SAED) is \n\nobtained by adjusting the magnetic lenses such that the image comes from back focal \n\nplane of the lens rather than the image plane, the spots in case of single crystal and rings \n\nin case of polycrystalline are observed.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3-7 Schematics of optical microscope, TEM and SEM (from left to right) with \n\nimportant parts are named [333]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n101 \n\nExperimental details \n\nThe major application of TEM is to study the morphology of materials, and to \n\nobtain crystallographic and compositional information (if so equipped). TEM can also \n\ngive information about structural aspects, phases, impurities, elemental analyses and \n\ndislocations. SAED is also required to calculate the lattice parameter and to observe the \n\ncrystallinity of the composites. \n\nThe resolution of the TEM is limited primarily by spherical aberration. By the \n\nreduction of the spherical aberration (by aberration correctors), an increase of the \n\nmechanical stability and the use of high voltages has led to the development of High \n\nResolution TEM (HRTEM) which allows the production of images with sufficient \n\nresolution to show carbon atoms in diamond separated by only 0.89 \u00c5 and atoms in silicon \n\nat 0.78 \u00c5 [334]. The ability to determine the positions of atoms within materials has made \n\nHRTEM an important tool for nano-technologies research and development.  \n\nIn this work, the microstructures were analysed by TEM with a 300 kV Hitachi, \n\nH9000-NA instrument and HRTEM manufactured by a Jeol 2200FS microscope worked \n\nat 200 kV. MWCNTs-BFO samples were observed in King Abdullah University of \n\nScience and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia using FEI Titan, 300 kV. \n\nFor TEM analysis powder samples were dispersed in chloroform. One drop of the \n\nformed suspension was then put on a lacy carbon grid supported on a copper grid (Agar \n\nScientific). The sample were dried in air for few hours before investigated for \n\nmorphology, elemental analysis, interface and d spacing of the MWCNTs and MWCNTs-\n\nFE by TEM.  \n\nScanning Electron Microscope (SEM) \n\nMost of the electronic systems of scanning electron microscope is similar to the \n\nones of TEM. However, here the sample image is formed from the secondary electrons, \n\nwhich reflect from the sample rather than transmitted and detected by the detector (Figure \n\n3-7). \n\nThe samples characterized by SEM were prepared as follows: MWCNTs and \n\nMWCNTs-FE powders were dispersed in ethanol or chloroform and few drops of the \n\nsuspension were spread on aluminium sample holders. After drying the samples were \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n102 \n\nExperimental details \n\ncovered with a thin layer of carbon in order to make them conductive. The carbon \n\ndeposition process was performed using an Emitech K950 carbon deposition chamber \n\nequipped with a turbo pump. The outgas time and evaporated time were 30 and 2 seconds, \n\nrespectively. The SEM analysis were performed using Hitachi SU- 70 (S-4100) (FCT: \n\nREDE/1509/RME/2005). \n\n3.3.6  Atomic force microscopy and Piezo force microscope \n\nAfter the invention of the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope (STM) it quickly \n\nbecame obvious that other physical processes could be used to map surfaces, not just a \n\ntunnelling current. Indeed, physical forces (Van Der Wall forces, electrostatic forces and \n\nso on) between the sample and the tip were proved to be used for image surfaces, and this \n\ntechnique named as atomic force microscopy (AFM) [335]. \n\nAFM works on two basic modes: contact mode and non-contact mode. In contact \n\nmode AFM, the tip (scanning probe) mounted on the cantilever is brought in contact with \n\nthe sample and scanned using piezoelectric actuators. The deflection of the cantilever is \n\naccurately monitored by laser spot reflected from the cantilever to the mirror and photo \n\ndiode, refer Figure 3-9 (a). These signals are passed to the feedback system which allow \n\nthe mapping of the sample surface [336]. During the interaction between the tip and the \n\nsample surface, the tip experiences rapidly changing forces. As the function of the \n\nmagnitude of these interaction forces the vibrational characteristics of the tip changes: \n\namplitude, frequency, magnitude etc. These signals are converted to get topography \n\nprofile of the samples. \n\nThe other mode of AFM operation is non-contact or tapping mode (TAFM). In \n\nthis mode the cantilever is placed at some particular Z distance from the sample (knows \n\nas set point), where the tip oscillates close to its resonance frequency (with free \n\namplitude). When the tip comes in contact with the sample forces the amplitude of the tip \n\nvibration reduces or increase by nm. This change in amplitude is monitored by the photo \n\ndiode similar to contact mode to acquire the topography of the sample. The major \n\nadvantages of the tapping over contact mode are the better resolution due to the negligible \n\nlateral forces and less wear of the tip. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n103 \n\nExperimental details \n\nAFM images are not a true representation of the sample topography due to the \n\ncomplex dynamics of the vibration tip and surface system. Therefore, there are limitations \n\nin achieving atomic resolution. This limitation can be overcome by using tips with very \n\nsmall (1-2 nm) tip diameter and having high aspect ratio. However, the tip used for AFM \n\nimaging are not ideally sharp and having low aspect ratio as shown in Figure 3-8 (a and \n\nb). Therefore, an AFM image does not reflect the true sample topography, but rather \n\nrepresents the interaction of the probe with the sample surface. This is called tip \n\nconvolution. Nevertheless, the tip convolution does not affect the height of the feature \n\nonly affects the lateral resolution.  \n\nIn the present work, this remark was kept in mind and the values mention in the \n\ntext for the size of MWCNTs-FE was related with the vertical measurements rather than \n\nlateral measurements.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3-8 Schematic illustrates the topography acquired from (a) a high aspect ratio \n\nand (b) a low aspect ratio tip. A high aspect ratio tip is the ideal probe (tip) to acquire \n\nbest resolution. Whereas, with low aspect ratio will results in the convolution. This does \n\nnot often influence the height of a feature but the lateral resolution [337]. \n\nIt was addressed in the previous chapter, that the nano scale ferroelectrics are of \n\ntechnological interest and therefore there is need to study the various aspect of \n\nferroelectric and piezoelectric properties at nano meter scale. Therefore, PFM was used \n\nto study the local ferroelectric properties of MWCNTs-FE. Schematic of experimental \n\nsetup for PFM is shown in Figure 3-9 (a) [155, 335].  \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n104 \n\nExperimental details \n\nIn general, the PFM is carried out in contact mode using a conductive tip, used as a \n\nmoveable nano electrode. The PFM response image is created from the deformation of \n\nferroelectric domains due to the applied external field. This deformation can be in the \n\nform of contraction, elongation or shear depending upon the polarization vector and \n\ndirection of the applied field. The PFM works on the converse piezoelectric effect where \n\nelectric field- induce strain (S). It is expressed as follow: \n\n Sj =  dijEi Equation 3-4 \n\nwhere Ei is the applied field and dij piezoelectric tensor. For a single\u2013domain \n\nferroelectric the piezoelectric coefficient relates to the spontaneous polarisation P s via \n\nthe following expression: \n\n dij =  ?imQjmkPs  Equation 3-5 \n\nwhere ?im is the dielectric constant, Qjmk is the electrostatic coefficient and dij \n\npiezoelectric tensor. \n\nThe above equation states linear coupling between piezoelectric and ferroelectric \n\nparameters and can be used to determine the domain polarity from the sign of field \n\ninduced strain. The electric field along the polarization direction results in the elongation \n\nof the domain. The contraction of the domains is observed when the direction of the \n\npolarization is opposite to the applied field direction. The relation between induced strain \n\n(S) and changes in thickness (?Z) is given by following equation:  \n\n S =   \n?Z\n\nZ\n=  \u00b1d33E Equation 3-6 \n\nwhere ?Z is the sample deformation, Z thickness of the sample, d33 effective \n\npiezoelectric constant. The above equation can be further rewritten as follow: \n\n ?Z = \u00b1d33V Equation 3-7 \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n105 \n\nExperimental details \n\nwhere ? is applied voltage. The contribution related to the electrostriction (given in \n\nEquation 3-5.) is typically much smaller than the piezoelectric response in a polarized state \n\nand vanishes if no dc field is applied to the sample. In the dynamic piezoresponse imaging \n\nmethod, an AC voltage is applied and the surface displacement is measured by the change \n\nin the vertical vibration of the cantilever, this response is know as vertical piezoresponse \n\n(VPFM), and amplitude is given by Equation 3-7.  \n\nWhen domain polarization direction is parallel to the surface, the imaging of that \n\ndomain is represented by detecting the torsional vibration of the cantilever Figure 3-9 (b) \n\nknown as lateral PFM (LPFM). This surface vibration translates via friction forces to the \n\ntorsional movement of the cantilever. The amplitude of the in-plan oscillation is given by  \n\n ?Xo =   d15Vo Equation 3-8 \n\nwhere ?Xo is the change in the deflection along the X axis and Vo is the applied voltage \n\nand d15 is piezoelectric coefficient. Single-point piezoresponse force spectroscopy (PFS) \n\nis a technique which allows to probe the domain growth by detecting the changes in area \n\nof domain orientation as a function of time. It is mainly used to study the domain growth. \n\nThe local ferroelectric hysteresis of the materials can be performed at the single point \n\nmode also known as switching spectroscopy (SS) PFM. Where the switching response of \n\nthe domain is measured as the function of applied dc bias from positive to negative cycle. \n\nThe characteristic local hysteresis response from the ferroelectric materials is shown in \n\nFigure 3-9 (c). \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n106 \n\nExperimental details \n\n \n \n\nFigure 3-9 (a) Schematic of PFM setup to simultaneously acquire the topography and the \n\nin- and out-of-plane component of the polarization. A function generator is used to apply \n\nan alternating voltage Vw between the tip and the bottom electrode of the ferroelectric, \n\n(b) schematic illustrates how PFM signals is acquired by the deformation of ferroelectric \n\nunder the applied field; the voltage induced cantilever deflection is detected by a reflected \n\nlaser beam on a four sector photodiode and (c) a hysteresis loop acquired by switching \n\nspectroscopy (SS-PFM)[338]. \n\nIn this work, the topography and simultaneously piezoelectric response was \n\nobtained by Standard Asylum SPM (at the University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland). \n\nThe vertical PFM was obtained when the mechanical oscillations were induced by \n\nalternating current (ac) voltage at frequency away from resonance frequency of the tip. \n\nMikroMasch series XSC11/Pt (cantilever no. B) silicon nitrate platinum coated tips were \n\nused, having a resonance frequency of 60 to 100 kHz and spring constant of 1.1 to 5.6 \n\nN/m. The PFM response was also obtained using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM, \n\nMultimode Nanoscope III A), equipped with external lock-in amplifier. Si AFM tips with \n\nplatinum coating (force constant 2.8 Nm-1 and resonant frequency 70 kHz, MikroMasch \n\nseries NSC18/Pt) were used with an applied voltage. As the effective piezoelectric \n\ncoefficient ((d33)eff is proportional to the amplitude signal, this can be defined as \n\n(d33)eff ? (amplitude signal . cos(phase signal)) / Vac, where Vac is the ac voltage \n\napplied. The local hysteresis measurement were carried on individual grains by \n\napplying dc bias in 20 steps, with 0.3 s duration of each step and 0.2 s delays after \n\nthe step. \n\n(b) (c) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n107 \n\nExperimental details \n\n3.3.7 Electrical characterization  \n\nIn this work, the capacitance and dielectric losses were measured using an \n\nimpedance bridge (HP 4284A, Agilent, USA) over a frequency range of 100 kHz to 1 \n\nMHz. The oscillation level of the applied voltage was set to 0.1-0.5 V. The analysed \n\nelectrical properties include the capacitance and loss tangent. The macro level electrical \n\nresponse on BiFeO3 deposited on top of Vertical Aligned (VA) MWCNTs was measured \n\nusing Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) configuration, where MWCNTs-cloth (cloth \n\nfabricated by vacuum filtration method) as top electrode and aligned MWCNTs as bottom \n\nelectrode was used (as presented in Figure 3-10).  \n\nTo confirm the ferroelectric behaviour of MWCNTs-BFO, polarization-electric \n\nfield (P-E) hysteresis loop were measured at room temperature using a Sawyer-Tower \n\ncircuit [157]. The loops were acquired at two set of frequencies 50 and 100 Hz using a \n\nferroelectric tester, Aixact, TF analyzer 1000. Current vs Voltage (I-V) measurements \n\nwere carried out on the pressed MWCNTs (as received and functionalized) from 0 to 3 V \n\nto study the conducting nature of the tubes. The distance between the probes is fixed at \n\n10 mm, approximately. \n\n \n\nFigure 3-10 Schematic representation of BFO in between aligned MWCNTs and \n\nMWCNTs cloth, where MWCNTs act as electrode for measuring dielectric properties and \n\nP-E loop. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nMWCNT-TE \nelectrode  \n\nB\nFO  \n\nAligned MWCNTs-BE \nelectrode \n\nSilicon \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n108 \n\nExperimental details \n\n3.3.8 Vibration sample magnetometer (VSM) \n\nVSM was invented by Simon Foner at Lincoln Laboratory MIT, in 1955. The \n\nworking principle of VSM is based on Faraday's law of induction, according to which the \n\nchange in the magnetic field results in induced electric fields. In VSM, the sample is \n\nplaced under a constant magnetic field. If the sample is magnetic, the domains of the \n\nsample are aligned in the direction of applied magnetic field and higher the magnetic field \n\nhigher is the magnetic moment. The magnetic dipoles of the sample create a magnetic \n\nfield around the sample and as the sample is moved (using piezoelectric actuators) up and \n\ndown there will be a change in the induced magnetic field as a function of time (change \n\nin induced emf) that can be sensed by pick up coils, in the form of electric field, according \n\nto Faradays law as induction electric fields. The induced voltage is amplified and signaled \n\nto a lock-in amplifier, where the piezoelectric signal is a reference signal. After the \n\nmathematical calculations, the induced magnetization as a function of applied magnetic \n\nfield can be monitored. From this measurement it is possible to plot a magnetic hysteresis \n\nloop. It is possible to detect very small moments about 10-4 to 10-6 emu. Various \n\nmeasurements can be made in a uniform magnetic field as a function of temperature and \n\nfield intensity [339]. In this work, Cryogenic VSM (Cryogenic Inc., UK) was used to \n\nmeasure the magnetic behaviour of samples up to 10 T at room temperature and at 5 K. \n\nThe flakes of MWCNTs-BFO placed inside the gelatin capsule was placed inside a non-\n\nmagnetic straw and is attached to the VSM vibrator for magnetic measurements. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n109 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\nChapter 4 \n4 Thermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n110 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\n \n\nAbstract  \n\nCarbon Nanotubes (CNTs) have unique physical properties. This has been the \n\ndriver for the current exploitation of their use in different advanced applications, such as \n\nin composite nano scale structures or devices. If a thermal treatment is required for the \n\nfabrication of the composite, the thermal decomposition behaviour of the tubes is a key \n\naspect in this process. Within this context the thermal decomposition behaviour under \n\ndifferent conditions of the MWCNTs used in this work was studied by DTA/TG, X-Ray, \n\nRaman spectroscopy and electron microscopy. \n\nOur studies revealed that purified MWCNTs are stable up to 420 oC in air, as no \n\nweight loss occurs in TG/DTA analysis under non isothermal conditions but morphology \n\nchanges were observed for isothermal conditions at 400 oC by Raman spectroscopy. In \n\noxygen-rich atmosphere MWCNTs started to oxidize at 200 oC. However in argon-rich \n\natmosphere and under a high heating rate MWCNTs remain stable up to 1300 oC with a \n\nminimum sublimation. The activation energy for the decomposition of MWCNTs in air \n\nwas calculated to lie between 80 and 108 kJ/mol. These results have broad implications \n\nfor the expanded use of MWCNTs in composites with functional complex oxides that \n\nusually require synthesis temperature above 650 oC. \n\nMWCNTs are hydrophobic in nature and to cover MWCNTs with FE, they were \n\nfunctionalized covalently and non-covalently. The FTIR studies confirms the attachment \n\nof functionalized groups on MWCNTs. The linear variation of current with voltage depict \n\nthe CNTs are metallic in nature. Vertical Aligned (VA) MWCNTs were also \n\ncharacterized for morphology and electrical properties. The microstructure of MWCNTs \n\nreveals well crystalline layer of graphene with presence of small amount of amorphous \n\ncarbon. I-V curve from VA-MWCNTs confirms the metallic behaviour. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n111 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\nAs described in chapter 2 scaling of electronics is no longer only about reducing \n\ndimensions; instead, it currently encompasses the development of emerging devices that \n\nincorporate new and combined functionalities. Carbon- based nano devices are expected \n\nto be integrated into nano electronics during the next decades [209]. MWCNTs were \n\ndiscovered in 1991, by Iijima [73] and since then have attracted tremendous interest in all \n\nfields of research and engineering. Due to its graphene structure CNTs have hydrophobic \n\nbehaviour and inert nature. So, a successful combination of CNTs with different materials \n\n(organic and inorganic) may require a process to modify the tube\u2019s surface through \n\nsurface functionalization [126]. Additionally, as-produced MWCNTs contain different \n\ncarbon species (or impurities), namely amorphous carbon, graphite and fullerenes. These \n\nspecies have different C-C bond length, curvature and strains that influence their surface \n\nand decomposition behaviour. Amorphous carbon acts as low temperature pre-ignition \n\nsites, and therefore as-prepared CNTs typically decompose at low temperatures. \n\nTherefore by removing the amorphous carbon the thermal resistance of the tubes \n\nimproves [138]. Chemical and thermal treatments are current procedures used to purify \n\nand improve the thermal resistance of CNTs. \n\nOn the other hand and from a different point of view, for composites in which \n\nthermal treatments at elevated temperatures during the synthesis are required, the thermal \n\nbehaviour of CNTs is a key feature. The high firing temperatures and controlled \n\natmospheres needed to synthesize and densify functional oxides used in microelectronic \n\napplications can be detrimental to the CNTs, compromising their role in the composite. \n\nIn spite of the previous studies on the thermal behaviour of MWCNTs towards their \n\npurification, the literature is still incomplete in the description and understanding of the \n\nthermal behaviour of MWCNTs under different atmospheres. \n\nIn this chapter the oxidation of MWCNTs and its dependence on the atmosphere \n\nis studied. The activation energy for the decomposition is calculated. The condition in \n\nwhich these MWCNTs can be used in combination with ferroic oxides are defined. In \n\naddition to improve the compatibility and liaison between MWCTs and ferroic oxides \n\ndifferent tubes functionalization was conducted. Since one of the main purposes of these \n\nMWCNTs is as possible bottom electrodes their metallic nature was investigated. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n112 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\n4.2 Experimental \n\nAs received MWCNTs (93% purity) were used to investigate the thermal stability. \n\nDifferential thermal and thermo gravimetric analysis (DTA/ TG) were carried out in a \n\nSETARAM Labsys TG-DTA12 system. The samples were heated in alumina crucibles \n\nup to 1400 \u00baC in air and flowing oxygen and argon atmospheres (0.4 L/min in both cases) \n\nfor different heating rates (2, 5, 10 and 20 \u00baC/min). For isothermal studies MWCNTs heat \n\ntreated inside DTA/TG equipment at particular temperature as a function of time. The \n\nmorphology of MWCNTs heat-treated at different temperatures, in different atmospheres \n\nwere analyzed by Raman (Bruker RFS 100/S FT) and TEM (Hitachi Microscope, Model \n\nH9000-NA). \n\nAs received MWCNTs were purified followed by functionalization by nitric acid \n\nand Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS), detailed procedure on functionalization is mentioned \n\nin chapter 3.  \n\nThese functionalized MWCNTs were characterized by Fourier Transform \n\nInfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy (Mattson Mod 7000 FTIR spectrometer).). The contact \n\nangle was measured on purified and functionalized MWCNTs using sessile drop method \n\n(Dataphysics, OCA 25). The morphology of the functional MWCNTs were investigated \n\nby Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and TEM. I-V curves were obtained on purified \n\nand functionalized MWCNTs by Aixact, TF analyzer 1000.  \n\n4.3 Results and Discussion \n\nTG and DTA curves of MWCNTs conducted in air are depicted in Figure 4-1. In \n\nair MWCNTs are thermally stable up to 420 oC, i.e. no phase change or any oxidation \n\nreaction took place. Above 420 oC, weight loss starts to occur due to the oxidation of the \n\namorphous carbon and of MWCNTs themselves Figure 4-1 (a)). DTA curves from the \n\nas-received MWCNTs are characterised by an exothermic peak between 500-600 \u00baC \n\ndepending on the heating rate, and an endothermic one above 700 \u00baC. For the heating rate \n\nof 20 \u00baC/min (Figure 4-1 (b)) two maxima between 510\u2013580 oC were observed which \n\ndemonstrate the presence of two different forms of carbon having similar oxidation \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n113 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\nbehaviour; i.e. amorphous carbon and MWCNTs.

The calculation of the activation energy is based on the temperature \n\nat which the maximum mass loss change occurs, for different heating rates and is \n\nexpressed as [340]: \n\n ?? \n?\n\n??\n2\n=  \n\n?\n\n ???\n+ ?? [\n\n??(?)\n\n??\n]\n??\n\n?\n Equation 4-1 \n\nwhere ? stands for the heating rate, f(?) for the conversion function, A for the pre-\n\nexponential factor, E (kJ/mol) for the activation energy for the reaction, R(J/mol K) for \n\nthe gas constant and Tp (K) for peak temperature where the mass change is maximum. \n\nThe activation energy for the decomposition was calculated from the slope of the variation \n\nof ln (?/(Tp)\n2  as a function of 1/Tp, to be 108kJ/mol. \n\nIn the Coat and Redfern model, in contrast to the previous one, the activation \n\nenergy is calculated based on the change in the mass fraction for a single heating rate, \n\naccording to the Equation 4-2 [340]: \n\n ?? [? ?? \n(1 ? ?)\n\n?2\n] =  ?? [\n\n?0?)\n\n??\n] ?  \n\n?\n\n??\n Equation 4-2 \n\nFor single heating rates of 2, 5, 10 and 20 \u00baC/min, the activation energy was calculated \n\nby plotting ln[-ln(1-?)/T2] against 1/T, where ? is the fraction of reactant, and calculated \n\nby the formula ((mi-mt)/(mf-mi)) from the TG data, where mi is the initial mass, mt is the \n\nmass at a given temperature and mf is the final mass. In this case, the activation energy \n\nwas calculated to be 80 kJ/mol. \n\nThe thermal behaviour of MWCNTs under partial oxygen and argon atmospheres \n\nis depicted in Figure 4-2. The tubes started to decompose at 200 oC under partial oxygen \n\nand at 430 oC under argon. The enhanced amount of oxygen increases the reaction rate at \n\nlower temperature and results in the oxidation of the amorphous carbon at 200 oC. The \n\nmajor losses occur above 420 oC in partial oxygen atmosphere, which is similar to the \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n115 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\noxidation of MWCNTs in air where both amorphous carbon and MWCNTs oxidizes \n\nsimultaneously. Even at higher heating rates of 40 \u00baC/min, under which MWCNTs kept \n\nunchanged until 540 oC/min, the excess amount of oxygen accelerates the oxidation of \n\nMWCNTs resulting in the total oxidation of the tubes below 670 \u00baC (Figure 4-2 (a)). \n\nIn partial argon atmosphere (Figure 4-2 (b)), no sublimation occurs before 430 oC \n\nfor both 2 oC/min and 40 oC/min heating rates. For 2 oC/min a first 20 % weight loss \n\noccurs before 800 oC, which may be due to the amorphous carbon, and the rest of the \n\nMWCNTs were sublimation between 800 - 1280 oC. Heating in argon makes possible to \n\nretain the maximum amount of MWCNTs until 800 oC, even for a low heating rate. For \n\nthe heating rate of 40 oC/min the sublimation of MWCNTs starts just at 500 oC which is \n\nmainly from amorphous carbon, and until 1400 oC only ca. 25% loss occurs. For this high \n\nheating rate MWCNTs were kept up to 1300 oC with very negligible sublimation. \n\n \n\nFigure 4-2: TG of as received MWCNTs in partial oxygen (a) and in partial argon (b) \n\natmospheres. The tubes started to decompose at 200 oC under partial oxygen with the \n\ntotal oxidation occurring below 670 \u00baC. Under a reducing atmosphere, even for a low \n\nheating rate, the tubes remain intact up to 800 oC. \n\nAs received MWCNTs contain impurities (amorphous carbon, metal particles, \n\netc.) and the graphite layers are not uniform along the tube, which results from point \n\ndefects and faults between graphite layers. MWCNTs heat treated at 400 \u00baC in air for \n\ndifferent periods of time do not show any visual changes in the morphology corroborating \n\nthe TG analysis, where no weight loss was noticed at 400 \u00baC. However, MWCNTs heated \n\nat 500 \u00baC show an increase in the tubes diameter and ruptures of walls clearly indicating \n\n(b) (a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n116 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\nthe oxidation process that results in breaking of MWCNTs (marked by circles in Figure \n\n4-3 (a)). With the further increase in temperatures (600 \u00baC) MWCNTs formed bundles \n\ndue to the reduction in the free energy of the system, as previously reported for Double \n\nWall Carbon Nanotubes (DWCNTs) [342] and the morphology were severely affected \n\npresented in Figure 4-3 (b).  \n\nThe morphology of MWCNTs treated in argon at 800 oC with heating rate of 2 \n\noC/min is depicted in Figure 4-3 (c). The TEM micrograph shows uniform and intact tube \n\nwalls with no presence of amorphous carbon. The decomposition of the MWCNTs cap \n\n(i.e. end) was observed (marked by a circle in the Figure 4-3 (c)), which is due to the high \n\nreactivity of the sp3 bonds associated with the cap, and the high local curvature strain. \n\nFigure 4-3 (d) depicts the Raman spectra for MWCNTs heat-treated at 600 and 800 \u00baC in \n\nargon with R (defined in Chapter 3) values of 1.01 and 1.005, respectively. The R value \n\nof MWCNTs heat treated at 600 \u00baC is higher than the one of MWCNTs heat treated at \n\n800 \u00baC, due to the presence of a relative high amount of impurities, in this case amorphous \n\ncarbon and metal particles, which results in a high intensity of the disorder band (D) for \n\n600 \u00baC. After heat treated at 800 \u00baC the amount of impurities in the tubes decreases and \n\nthe D band intensity decreases, as well. \n\n \n\n  \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n117 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\n  \n\nFigure 4-3: TEM micrograph (a) of MWCNTs heat treated at 500 \u00baC and (b) MWCNTs \n\nheat treated at 600 \u00baC in air; (c) TEM micrograph of MWCNT heated at 800 \u00baC at 2 \n\noC/min in argon and (d) Raman spectra for as received, heat-treated at 600 \u00baC and 800 \n\n\u00baC MWCNT with R values in argon with heating rate of 2\u00baC/min (c). \n\n4.4 Functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs  \n\nMWCNTs are hydrophobic in nature which results in poor wettability. In order to \n\nimprove the wettability of the MWCNTs prior to be used for the fabrication of MWCNTs-\n\nFE structures they were functionalized by chemical processes. The MWCNTs were \n\nrefluxed in nitric acid (detailed description mentioned in Chapter 3) to create defects site \n\nby breaking the sp2 and sp3 carbon bonds and induce hydroxyl and carboxyl groups at \n\nthose sites. This type of functionalization in known as covalent functionalization.  \n\nMWCNTs were also functionalized with SDS, where the aliphatic chains of SDS \n\nadsorbed on the surface of MWCNTs with week forces such as Van Der Waals forces. \n\nThis type of functionalization is known as non-covalent functionalization. Both covalent \n\nand non-covalent functionalized MWCNTs were used in this work. Figure 4-4 represents \n\nthe schematic of covalent and non-covalent functionalize CNTs. \n\n(c) (d) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n118 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\n \n\nFigure 4-4 Schematic depicts covalent (on top right) and non-covalent (on bottom right) \n\nfunctionalization carried out using acid treatment by nitric acid and sodium dodecyl \n\nsulphate (SDS), respectively. The covalent functionalization took place on defect sites and \n\nvery local, whereas, non-covalent functionalization with SDS molecules adsorbed along \n\nthe nano tube, covering maximum surface. \n\nThe purified and covalent functionalized MWCNTs were characterized by \n\nvibrational spectroscopy (FTIR) in order to identify the functional groups attach to the \n\nsurface of MWCNTs, given in Figure 4-5. Purified MWCNTs depict the characteristic \n\npeak at 1629 cm-1 that is associated with the vibration of the carbon skeleton from the \n\ncarbon nanotubes. The peaks at 3446, 2977 and 2971 cm-1 for purified MWCNTs are \n\nassigned to hydroxyl groups (-OH), asymmetric stretching of CH2 groups and symmetric \n\nstretching of CH2 groups [343] which might result of some structural or point defects on \n\nCNTs. FTIR spectra of covalent functionalized MWCNTs shows an increase in \n\nabsorption band 3446 cm-1, attributed to the hydroxyl group (-OH) that clearly indicates \n\nthe increase in number of OH groups attach to the surface of CNTs.

The characteristic band from MWCNTs is present at 1629 cm-1. \n\nFurther the wettability of the MWCNTs were assessed by measuring the contact \n\nangles between MWCNTs and water droplets. The optical micrograph for purified \n\nMWCNTs and functionalized (HNO3) with water droplet on the surface is given in Figure \n\n4-6. The contact angle for purified MWCNTs is 150\u00ba, which decreases to 52\u00ba for the \n\nfunctionalized MWCNTs. This results clearly corroborates the FTIR observation on the \n\npresence of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on the surface of MWCNTs which results in \n\nthe improved wettability. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n120 \n\nThermal studies, functionalization and characterization of MWCNTs \n\n  \n\nFigure 4-6 Optical micrograph of the water droplet on the surface of  (a) purified \n\nMWCNT and (b) nitric acid functionalized MWCNT, the contact angle decrease from 150 \n\n\u00ba to 52 \u00ba after functionalization of MWCNTs, confirm the improvement in wettability of \n\nMWCNTs.  \n\nThe MWCNTs tubes as-received, purified and functionalised were characterized \n\nby SEM and TEM (Figure 4-7). SEM micrographs for as-received MWCNTs show the \n\npresence of amorphous carbon and the metal particles (appears bright in the micrograph) \n\nFigure 4-7 (a). Whereas, after the purification process the MWCNTs are almost free from \n\namorphous carbon and metal particles. The purified MWCNTs are more agglomerated \n\nand hence difficult to distinguish them in SEM (Figure 4-7 (b)). After functionalising \n\nMWCNTs (with 5M HNO3) shows less agglomeration with few impurities as presented \n\nin Figure 4-7 (c). The TEM micrograph of the functionalised MWCNTs depicts a well \n\ncrystalline carbon lattice with fewer defects and having interlayer distance between \n\ncarbon walls around 0.34 nm.

To confirm the \n\nfunctionalization of MWCNTs with SDS they were characterized with FTIR (Figure 4-8). \n\nPeak at 1629 cm-1 is associated with the vibration of the carbon skeleton from the carbon \n\nnanotubes, this peak is very clear for both MWCNTs and SDS functionalized MWCNTs. \n\nFor SDS functionalized tubes two more peaks are present in comparison to as received \n\nMWCNTs; one at 1058 cm?1 assigned to the symmetrical stretching vibration of S=O and \n\nsecond at 881 cm?1 assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of C\u2013O\u2013S [346, \n\n347].

I-V curves were measured with the application of dc bias up to \n\n\u00b1 3 V. I-V curve for as received, nitric acid functionalized (covalent functionalization) \n\nand SDS functionalization (non-covalent functionalization) depicts the linear change in \n\ncurrent with the application of the applied voltage. This states the ohmic nature of the \n\ntubes as shown by metals, hence they are metallic in nature. Whereas, as-received \n\nMWCNTs depicts less current values (~0.5 mA) at 3 V in comparison to nitric acid (1.5 \n\nmA) and SDS functionalised MWCNTs (1.7 mA). This is due to the presence of \n\nimpurities such as amorphous carbon and metal particle for the as received MWCNTs \n\nwhich affects the electron flow path in the tubes.  \n\nThe current values in the case of SDS functionalized tubes are slightly better in \n\ncomparison to the nitric acid functionalized tubes (at 3 V for SDS MWCNTs 1.7 mA and \n\nfor nitric acid MWCNTs 1.5 mA). This indicates that during the covalent \n\nfunctionalization the breaking of carbon lattice occurs (defects).

In case of non-covalent \n\nfunctionalized MWCNTs the defect sites were not induce because the functionalize \n\nmolecules are adsorbed on the surface of the MWCNTs rather than making covalent \n\nbonding as in case of covalent functionalized MWCNTs. Therefore the current flow for \n\nSDS functionalised MWCNTs is slightly higher in comparison to covalent functionalized \n\nMWCNTs.  \n\n \n\nFigure 4-9 I-V curves for as received, oxidative treatment with nitric acid (covalent \n\nfunctionalization) and SDS functionalized (non.-covalent functionalization) MWCNTs.

Under these conditions the activation energy for the decomposition \n\nof the tubes lies between 80 and 108 kJ/mol. The decomposition of MWCNTs is \n\naccelerated in oxygen and decelerated in argon, as expected. The tubes start to decompose \n\nat 200 oC and at 430 oC at oxygen and argon atmosphere, respectively. The MWCNTs \n\nheat treated at 800 \u00baC with heating rate of 2 oC/min in argon atmosphere are well intact \n\nwithout major physical damage of the walls. However, under a reducing atmosphere and \n\nfor high heating rates MWCNTs are kept stable up to 1300 oC with very negligible \n\ndecomposition. These are relevant results for the further utilization of MWCNTs in \n\ncomposites with functional complex oxides with synthesis temperature usually above 650 \n\noC. FTIR and I-V curves for covalent and non-covalent functionalized MWCNTs confirm \n\nthat the MWCNTs are functionalised and metallic in behaviour. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n126 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\nChapter 5  \n5 Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate \n\n(PZT)   \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n127 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract  \n\nIn this chapter we prove that it is feasible to utilise MWCNTs as electrodes for \n\nthe formation of 1D Pb(Zr1-xTix)O3 (PZT) nano ferroelectrics. In addition we unveil the \n\nrole of CNTs on the phase formation of nano ferroelectrics.  \n\nGrowing a ferroelectric on the surface of CNTs is a non-trivial task. Previous \n\nworks have clearly demonstrated the damage of the CNT lattice after the annealing of the \n\noxide. In this work we demonstrate that MWCNTs decrease the time and temperature for \n\nformation of lead zirconium titanate PZT by ~100 \u00baC commensurate with a decrease in \n\nactivation energy from 68\u00b115 kJ/mol to 27\u00b12 kJ/mol. As a consequence, monophasic \n\nPZT was obtained at 575 \u00baC for MWCNTs-PZT whereas for pure PZT traces of \n\npyrochlore were still present at 650 \u00baC, where PZT phase formed due to homogeneous \n\nnucleation. The piezoelectric nature of MWCNT-PZT synthesised at 500 \u00baC for 1 h was \n\nverified. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n128 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nAs mentioned before PZT is commercially used in a large number of \n\nmicroelectronic devices such as ferroelectric memories (FeRAMs), electromechanical \n\nsensors and actuators, due to its high dielectric constant (~800) and polarisation (40 \n\n\u00b5C/cm2) and large piezoelectric (d33 > 300 pC/N) and electromechanical coupling \n\ncoefficients (keff = 0.42) [348]. Hence PZT was one of the targeted materials in this PhD \n\nwork. \n\nHowever, PZT from conventional solid state reaction requires high temperature, \n\nbetween 900-1000 oC [349] and care must be taken to compensate for the volatilization \n\nof lead oxide [350, 351]. PZT has been prepared by chemical methods such as \n\nhydrothermal synthesis[352, 353], sol gel [354-356] and co precipitation [349]. These \n\nroutes guarantee compositional homogeneity at the molecular level and reduce \n\ncrystallization temperature.  \n\nAs described in Chapter 2, the use of CNTs as templates or as bottom electrodes \n\nis a potential strategy to realise 3D ferroelectric nano structures [4, 21, 28, 90, 357]. \n\nHowever, the practical use of CNTs as bottom electrodes depends on the ability to retain \n\ntheir geometry and integrity during fabrication. In the last years, only a few reports on the \n\ninvestigation of MWCNTs covered with ferroelectrics for 3D capacitors and related \n\napplications have been published (referred in section 2.5). In 2007 Kawasaki et al. [21] \n\nwas the first to report the coverage of aligned MWCNTs with PZT by Liquid Source \n\nMisted Chemical Deposition (LSMCD). The authors found that annealing at 600 oC \n\nresulted in the damage of the CNT lattice and reaction between the substrate and the tubes. \n\nIn 2012, Mohammadi et al. [26] used MWCNTs as a sacrificial template to synthesise 1D \n\nPZT tubes by sol gel. The early decomposition of CNTs between 400 - 500 oC was \n\nobserved and the authors refer to early formation of perovskite (at ~ 450 \u00baC) but no further \n\ninformation or discussion was provided.  \n\nIn this work, we coated MWCNTs with PZT via a chemical solution process, \n\nwhich offers crystallisation of the perovskite phase at low temperature. Interaction \n\nbetween the PZT and CNTs as a function of the temperature is studied using thermo  \n\ngravimetric (DTA/TG), X-Ray diffraction and microscopy characterisation. The \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n129 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\nactivation energy for the perovskite phase formation is calculated and the role of CNTs \n\nin perovskite crystallization addressed. The piezoelectric and ferroelectric responses of \n\nMWCNTs coated with PZT are reported.  \n\n5.2 Experimental \n\nA diol-based sol-gel was utilised to coat the MWCNTs used in this work. The \n\ntubes were functionalized with 5 M nitric acid to improve their wettability (as described \n\nin Chapter 2). Lead(II) acetate trihydrate (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed with 1, 2 \n\npropanol diol and acetic acid for 30 min at 60 \u00baC. Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (97 %, \n\nFluka) stabilized with acetylacetone (1:2 mol ratio) was then added to the lead acetate \n\nsolution followed by mixing for 30 min at 60 \u00baC. Zirconium(IV) propoxide (70 %, Fluka) \n\nstabilized with acetyl acetone (1:2 mol ratio) was subsequently added followed by \n\ndilution with acetic acid to obtain a 0.2 M solution containing the correct proportions of \n\nPb, Zr and Ti.  \n\n5 wt. per cent (approximately) of MWCNTs were immersed in the PZT solution \n\nand ultra sonicated for >2 h (Branson, USA, 40 kHz). During the sonication process \n\ntemperature stay well below 50 oC and no bubbles or precipitations occurred. The solution \n\nwas then stirred on a hot plate at 70 oC for ~ 1 h and gelation occurred. The gel was dried \n\nat 120 oC for 24 h to obtain MWCNTs-PZT composite powders. Similar steps were \n\nfollowed to obtain PZT powders. A flow chart representing the steps followed to fabricate \n\nPZT and MWCNTs - PZT are illustrated in Figure 5-1. \n\nPZT and MWCNTs-PZT powders were characterized by differential thermal and \n\nthermo gravimetric analysis (DTA/ TG), carried out in a SETARAM Labsys TG-DTA12 \n\nsystem in air up to 700 oC with heating rate of 5 oC /min. The phase formation of PZT \n\nwith and without MWCNTs was followed by in-situ XRD (Philips X\u00b4\u00b4 Pert. Cu, K?), \n\ncarried out in air at 5 oC/min up to 650 \u00baC. Ex-situ XRD (Rigaku, Geigerflex D/Max-C, \n\nCu K?) was used to characterize MWCNTs-PZT powders heated for 1 h at various \n\ntemperatures. All the samples investigated in the present studies were heat treated in \n\nalumina crucibles covered with platinum foils. These MWCNTs - PZT composites were \n\nfurther studied by Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy (Mattson Mod 7000 \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n130 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\nFTIR spectrometer) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Hitachi Microscope, \n\nModel H9000-NA and JEOL, Model 2200 FS). \n\n \n\nFigure 5-1 Flow chart illustrates the steps followed to fabricate PZT and MWCNTs-PZT.  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n131 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\nThe piezoelectric and ferroelectric response of MWCNTs-PZT were investigated \n\nby Atomic Force Microscope (AFM, Multimode Nanoscope III A), equipped with \n\nexternal lock-in amplifier for measuring piezo response. Si cantilevers with platinum \n\ncoating (force constant 2.4 N/m and resonant frequency 80 kHz, MIKROMASCH) were \n\nused with an applied voltage of 5 V. Topography signals of the surface were taken \n\nsimultaneously with the amplitude and phase signals and were collected in contact \n\nmode. Several hysteresis loops with dc bias from - 40 to + 40 V were obtained for \n\nMWCNTs-PZT to ensure the reproducibility of the results, and representative loop \n\nis presented. Switchable polarization corresponds to the difference b etween the \n\npositive saturation polarization and negative ones (R m = (RS)\n+ - (RS)\n\n-). As the \n\neffective piezoelectric coefficient ((d33)eff) is proportional to the amplitude signal, \n\nthis can be defined as (d33)eff ? (amplitude signal . cos(phase signal)) / Vac, where \n\nVac is the ac voltage applied. \n\n5.3 Results and Discussion \n\nFigure 5-2 (a) illustrates the DTA analysis conducted in air at different heating \n\nrates (5, 10, 20 and 30 oC/min) for PZT (continuous line) and MWCNTs-PZT samples \n\n(dashed line). For PZT heated at 5 oC/min., there is a small broad exothermic peak at ~200 \n\n\u00baC related to the release of low temperature organics. Between 200 and 350 oC, a further \n\nbroad exothermic peak occurs, attributed to the combustion of organic solvents. On \n\nincreasing temperature, the next broad exotherm lies between 420 \u00baC - 570 oC and \n\ncorresponds to the formation of pyrochlore phase [358] followed by transformation to \n\nperovskite observed as a small shoulder at 505 \u00baC. \n\nHowever, for MWCNTs-PZT heated at 5 \u00baC/min, the broad exothermic peak \n\ncorresponding to the formation of the pyrochlore phase begins at ~ 350 oC, ~ 80 oC lower \n\nthan PZT. Moreover, the transformation to perovskite is complete by 480 oC for \n\nMWCNTs-PZT as opposed to 570 \u00baC for PZT. According to our previous studies, the \n\nexothermic peak for the oxidation of MWCNTs starts at ~ 420 oC [359] but in the present \n\nstudy this peak is not observed since it overlaps with that of pyrochlore and perovskite \n\nphase formation. From the TG analysis of PZT and MWCNTs-PZT samples, four major \n\nweight loss events (I, II, III and IV) are identified (Figure 5-2 (b)). The first (I), an \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n132 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\nexothermic event with ~2 - 10 wt% loss, occurs below 200 oC due to the evaporation of \n\nwater and solvents. The second (II), also exothermic but with ~25% and 20% wt% loss \n\nfor PZT and MWCNTs-PZT, respectively, occurs in the range 200 to 300 oC due to the \n\ncombustion of organics. The third (III), ~6% for PZT between 300 oC and 450 oC, may \n\nrelate to the decomposition of residual organics. For PZT, a small additional weight loss, \n\n~3% is observed up to 560 \u00baC (IV). For MWCNTs-PZT above 400 \u00baC, the weight loss is \n\nhigher than that observed for PZT and is continuous up to 750 \u00baC. According to our \n\nprevious studies, oxidation of MWCNTs occurs up to ~750 \u00baC. In comparing the TG \n\nspectra of PZT and MWCNTs-PZT the observed difference in the weight loss is ~5 %, \n\nwhich is approximately the wt% MWCNTs added in the MWCNTs-PZT samples. \n\nNonetheless, it is evident that the formation of pyrochlore and perovskite phases takes \n\nplace at lower temperature for the case of MWCNTs - PZT in comparison with PZT. \n\nTo study further the phase formation, in-situ XRD was carried out on both PZT \n\nand MWCNTs-PZT powders (Figure 5-3). For PZT, peaks attributed to pyrochlore appear \n\nat ~500 \u00baC and with perovskite at 550 \u00baC (Figure 5-3 (a)). However, for MWCNTs-PZT \n\nsmall peaks ascribed to pyrochlore and perovskite appear at 450 \u00baC (Figure 5-3 (b)). \n\nMoreover, for MWCNTs-PZT perovskite peaks become sharper as temperature increases \n\nwith monophasic PZT obtained at 575 \u00baC. In contrast, for PZT, traces of pyrochlore are \n\nstill identifiable at 650 \u00baC.  \n\nEx-situ XRD analysis of samples calcined for 1 h at different temperatures are \n\npresented in Figure 5-4. For MWCNTs-PZT annealed at 400 \u00baC, the volume fraction of \n\nPZT perovskite phase is enhanced when compared with in-situ XRD of MWCNTs-PZT \n\nat 400 \u00baC. For MWCNTs-PZT annealed 1 h at 500 \u00baC, only peaks associated with \n\nperovskite are present. Further increasing the annealing temperature to 550 \u00baC sharpens \n\nthe perovskite peaks, presumably due to an increase in scattering coherence length related \n\nto grain growth. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n133 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5-2 (a) DTA and (b) TG analysis of PZT (continuous line) and MWCNTs-PZT \n\n(dashed line) heat treated at different heating rates: 5, 10, 20 and 30 oC/min.

Note the simultaneous appearance of pyrochlore and \n\nperovskite phase after 1 h at 400 oC and monophasic perovskite after 1 h at 550 oC. \n\nFTIR spectra of MWCNTs and MWCNTs-PZT samples (annealed 1 h at 400, \n\n450, 500 and 550 oC) are shown in Figure 5-5. The spectrum of MWCNT has one major \n\ncharacteristics peaks at 1630 cm-1. The transmittance bands at 3448 cm-1 and around 1580 \n\ncm-1 correspond to the stretching of O-H and C-H bonds and its occurrence in all the \n\nsamples confirms the presence of organics. For MWCNT-PZT the bands at 1640 cm-1 and \n\n1315 cm-1 correspond to acetic acid or acetate [360] and bands at 1436 and 1560 cm-1 are \n\nattributed to symmetric and asymmetric -COO stretching modes of the acetate groups \n\n[361]. \n\nMWCNTs-PZT heat-treated at 400 - 450 oC exhibit additional peaks identified as \n\nan intermediate acetate salt whose bands occur at 1050, 1020, 940, 860, 666 and 620 cm-\n\n1. The intensity of these peaks diminishes for MWCNTs-PZT samples heated 1 h at 500 \n\noC but there are additional peaks at ~588 cm-1 and 349 cm-1. These two transmittance \n\npeaks are attributed to TiO6 and ZrO6 stretching and bending of the octahedra, \n\nrespectively, confirming the formation of perovskite [362].

The combination of XRD (in-situ and ex-situ), \n\nDTA/TG and FTIR studies clearly indicates that the presence of MWCNTs facilitates the \n\ncrystallization process of PZT and reduces the crystallization temperature by ~100 oC. \n\nHowever, the mechanism of PZT formation and the growth of the perovskite phase \n\nrequired further study using TEM. \n\n \n\nFigure 5-5 FTIR spectra of MWCNTs and MWCNT-PZT samples annealed 1h at 400, \n\n450, 500 and 550 oC. The characteristic peaks of CNTs at 1630 cm-1 and at 349 and 588 \n\ncm-1 are from octahedra of Zr and Ti and indicate the formation of a crystalline PZT. \n\nFigure 5-6 (a) is a TEM micrograph of MWCNTs-PZT, dried 24 h at 100 \u00baC, \n\nwhich illustrates the conformal covering of MWCNTs with an amorphous PZT sol and \n\nalso depicts the presence of some particulates. This sample was further analysed under \n\nhigh resolution (HR) TEM. Crystalline particles of lead ions with d spacing of ~ 0.30 nm \n\nsurrounded by an amorphous network of zirconium and titanium are observed (Figure 5-6 \n\n(b)). EDS spectra confirmed the presence of lead, zirconium and titanium (inset of Figure \n\n5-6 (b)). Similar observations have been previously reported in the literature for the \n\ngrowth of BaTiO3 and ZnO.

The activation energy of phase formation of PZT and MWCNTs-PZT \n\nmay be calculated by applying the Kissinger equation [340] to data from DTA (Table \n\n5-1). The maximum energy change associated with the combustion of organics, formation \n\nof pyrochlore and perovskite phase is calculated from the DTA peaks (heating rate of 5 \n\n\u00baC/min), marked as: i) A (combustion of organics), B (pyrochlore) and C (perovskite), \n\ncorresponding to 254, 453 and 505 \u00baC, respectively for PZT (Figure 5-7 (a)) and ii) A\u2019, \n\nB\u2019 and C\u2019, corresponding to 265, 366 and 395 \u00baC, respectively for MWCNTs-PZT (Figure \n\n5-7 (b)). A Gaussian function was used to fit the DTA data for different heating rates and \n\nthe associated maximum energy change (together with measurement error) are indicated \n\nin Table 1. \n\nKissinger\u00b4s model assumes that the reaction is of first order and irreversible in \n\nnature. The calculation of the activation energy is based on the temperature at which the \n\nmaximum mass loss occurs, for different heating rates and is expressed as [340]: \n\n \n?(???/??)\n\n?(??)\n=  \n\n?\n\n ?\n Equation 5-1 \n\nwhere ? stands for the heating rate (5, 10, 15 and 20 oC/min in the present study), E \n\n(kJ/mol) for the activation energy for the reaction, R (J/mol K) for the gas constant and \n\nTp (kelvin) for peak temperature. The Tp was calculated from peak fitting and the \n\nactivation energy from the slope of the variation of In (? /(Tp)\n as a function of 1/ Tp. The \n\nactivation energy for pyrochlore and perovskite phase for PZT is 248\u00b129 kJ/mol and \n\n68\u00b115 kJ/mol, respectively and for MWCNT-PZT is 158\u00b125 kJ/mol and 27\u00b12 kJ/mol, \n\nrespectively. As anticipated, the activation energy for the formation of both the \n\npyrochlore and perovskite phase is lower for MWCNT-PZT in comparison to PZT. As \n\nshown in Figure 5-7 (a) good fitting is obtained for all the peaks. A certain uncertainty \n\nmay be associated with peak A fitting, due to the combustion of the different organics \n\npresent in precursor powders, still the error associated is limited. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n141 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\nThe origin of the lower of activation energy may be explained by a combination \n\nof factors. The presence of high surface area of the tubular CNTs may act as \n\nheterogeneous nucleation sites for the oxide crystallization at low temperatures, reducing \n\nthe activation energy for PZT in the presence of MWCNTs. \n\nThe perovskite formation in PZT is a sequential transition through an intermediate \n\npyrochlore/fluorite phase. The transformation of pyrochlore into perovskite is a \n\nnucleation-controlled process where the perovskite nucleation is the rate-controlling step \n\n[365, 366]. If the nucleation energy is reduced the crystallization temperature of the \n\nperovskite phase is lowered. Indeed, low processing temperature can be obtained if the \n\nunderlayer provides heterogeneous nucleation sites [367-373]. However, this seeding \n\neffect of CNTs has not been previously reported. In fact, the result is somewhat \n\nunexpected, as C-based compounds have not traditionally been considered for nucleation \n\nor for substrates for these perovskite materials. In addition, the local increase in \n\ntemperature in the vicinity of the MWCNTs due to exothermic oxidation may also \n\ncontribute to the overall lowering of the activation energy. MWCNTs start to oxidize at \n\n420 \u00baC and around this temperature there is the simultaneous appearance of pyrochlore \n\nand perovskite phase. Nevertheless, the major part of the CNTs remain intact up to ~500 \n\n\u00baC, which indicates they may be only locally oxidized, confirming the TG observations. \n\nThe schematic of possible scenarios is given in Figure 5-8. \n\n   \n\nFigure 5-7 Gaussian fitting of differential thermal analysis peaks of (a) PZT and (b) \n\nMWCNT-PZT samples with an heating rate of 5 \u00baC/min, marked with A (A\u00b4), B (B\u00b4) and \n\nC (C\u00b4) that corresponds to the maximum energy change during the combustion of \n\norganics, formation of pyrochlore and perovskite, respectively. \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n142 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\nTable 5-1 DTA peaks for PZT and MWCNTs - PZT samples and activation energy \n\ncalculated from Kissinger equation for oxidation of organics, pyrochlore and perovskite. \n\nHeating Rate \n\n(oC/min) \nPhase \n\nTemperature of \n\nmaximum energy \n\nchange for PZT \n\nTemperature of \n\nmaximum energy \n\nchange for MWCNT-\n\nPZT \n\n5 \n\nOrganic 254 265 \n\nPyrochlore 453 366 \n\nPerovskite 505 395 \n\n10 \n\nOrganic 266 276 \n\nPyrochlore 464 386 \n\nPerovskite 587 484 \n\n15 \n\nOrganic 272 279 \n\nPyrochlore 467 390 \n\nPerovskite 596 523 \n\n20 \n\nOrganic 278 286 \n\nPyrochlore 476 395 \n\nPerovskite 613 582 \n\nActivation Energy (kJ/mol) for PZT \n\npyrochlore                               perovskite \n\n248\u00b129                                      68\u00b115 \n\nActivation Energy (kJ/mol) for MWCNTs - PZT \n\npyrochlore                                perovskite \n\n158\u00b125                                      27\u00b12 \n\n \n\nFrom the application point of view the electrical response of MWCNTs-PZT is \n\nimportant, therefore the local piezoelectric and ferroelectric behaviour of MWCNTs-PZT \n\nannealed at 500 oC for 1 h were investigated through vertical piezoresponse force \n\nmicroscopy (VPFM).

For sol gel based MWCNTs-PZT structures a \n\nsystematic study on the phase formation process by in-situ and ex-situ XRD, DTA, FTIR \n\nand HRTEM detected perovksite phase formation in the presence of the MWCNTs at \n\n~100 oC lower than without, accompanied by a decrease in activation energy from 68\u00b115 \n\nkJ/mol for PZT and 27\u00b12 kJ/mol. As a consequence, monophasic PZT was obtained at \n\n575 \u00baC for MWCNT-PZT whereas for PZT traces of pyrochlore are still identifiable at \n\n(a) \n\n(c) \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n145 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Lead zirconium titanate (PZT) \n\n650 \u00baC. We proposed that MWCNTs act as seeds to reduce the nucleation barrier of \n\nperovksite phase formation by providing the low energy nucleation sites and the \n\nexothermic oxidation of MWCNTs. In addition the piezoelectric nature of MWCNT-PZT \n\nsynthesised at 500 \u00baC for 1 h was proved. Though further work is necessary, these results \n\nare of particular relevance in 3D ferroelectric nano capacitors in which CNTs are \n\nproposed as bottom electrodes. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n146 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\nChapter 6 \n6 Multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT)  \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n147 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract: \n\nIn this chapter MWCNTs-BaTiO3 (BT) structures fabricated from hydrothermal \n\nmethod are described. Two strategies for the functionalization of MWCNTs have been used: \n\ncovalent and non-covalent functionalization.  \n\nUsing covalent functionalized MWCNTs, the conventional hydrothermal synthesis, in \n\nwhich TiO2 is previously deposited on the surface of MWCNTs prior to the reaction with Ba \n\nprecursors to form BT, proved to be ineffective. However, when using a sol gel hybrid \n\nhydrothermal process BT layers > 100 nm thick conformally covered the MWCNTs. \n\nMWCNTs-BT structures synthesised at 160 \u00baC are ferroelectric and exhibit an \n\nelectromechanical response of 15 pm/V.  \n\nHowever the process can be further improved if the MWCNTs are non-covalent \n\nfunctionalized, with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In this case the formation of carbonates is \n\nvery residual and the SDSMWCNTs-BT structures obtained are typically 20 to 200 nm in \n\ndiameter with lengths up to ~5 \u00b5m. These nano structures exhibit ferroelectric and piezoelectric \n\nbehaviour, with an effective piezoelectric coefficient of ~2 pm/V, as assessed by piezo force \n\nmicroscope (PFM). \n\nThis work not only demonstrates how to adapt the hydrothermal process to successfully \n\ncover CNTs with ferroelectric oxides, but also proves the concept of 3D nano capacitors based \n\non carbon nanotubes prepared by a low temperature and low cost process. This strategy can be \n\nused for many different ferroelectric oxides. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n148 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\n6.1 Introduction  \n\nIn the previous chapter the feasibility to synthesise MWCNTs-PZT ferroelectric nano \n\nstructures was proved. \n\nUp to now, compositions within the solid solution between PbZrO3 and PbTiO3, \n\ndesignated as PZT (Pb1-xZrxTiO3), have been widely used in ferroelectric memories, \n\npiezoelectric actuators, sensors and transducers, and more recently as promising energy \n\nharvesters. However, the use of PZT that contains more than 60 wt% of lead will soon be \n\nseverely restricted, due to lead toxicity [182]. Among the several possible lead free candidates \n\nto substitute PZT, BaTiO3 based compositions are of relevance. \n\nBT is a well-known lead free perovskite with high dielectric constant (~2000, at 1 kHz), \n\nlow dielectric loss (0.02, at 1 kHz) and Curie temperature at ~125 \u00baC [374, 375]. BT is used in \n\nmany applications such as multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs), temperature coefficient \n\nresistors, ultrasonic transducers, piezoelectric devices, and tuneable phase array antennas. BT \n\nsynthesis by solid state reaction is typically performed around 1100 to 1300 \u00baC [376]. BT can \n\nhowever be synthesised at around 650 \u00baC to 900 \u00baC by chemical solution methods such as sol \n\ngel [377] and co-precipitation [378] but these temperatures are still too high to avoid oxidation \n\nof MWCNTs (which is around 500 \u00baC). Therefore, for BT and other lead-free ferroelectrics, \n\nthere is a need to explore low temperature processes for their crystallization on MWCNTs.  \n\nHydrothermal synthesis is a low temperature chemical synthesis process by which \n\ncrystalline oxides particles [379] and/or thin films [380] can be obtained from reaction in \n\naqueous media at relative elevated temperature (> 25 oC) and pressure (> 100 KPa) [379]. A \n\nwide range of different oxides have been fabricated from 80 to 300 \u00baC, such as BaTiO3 [320, \n\n381, 382], PZT [383] and ZnO [313]. Hence hydrothermal synthesis might be suitable for the \n\nsynthesis of ferroelectric oxides in combination with MWCNTs. In previous reports, \n\nhydrothermal synthesis was used in the fabrication of MWCNTs-BT composite in which \n\nMWCNTs acted as metallic fillers to improve the thermal and electrical properties of the \n\ncomposites [28,29]. The MWCNTs-BT composites were hydrothermally synthesised in two \n\nsteps. First, TiO2 was immobilized on the surface of MWCNTs using a sol gel method. The \n\nTiO2-MWCNTs structures were then reacted with barium acetate to obtain MWCNTs-BT \n\npowders [18-20] but conformal coverage of individual tubes was not the main objective of the \n\nresearch. MWCNTs-BT have also been fabricated by the sol gel method [23, 24, 384]. In this \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n149 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\nmethod, MWCNTs-BT were annealed at 700 \u00baC in N2 subsequent to deposition to achieve a \n\nfinal BT layer, ~5-10 nm thick. Phase formation and interfacial aspects were not reported nor \n\ndid any of the above studies address the ferroelectric properties of MWCNTs-BT.  \n\nWithin this context, in this work we exploit two different approaches to cover covalent \n\nfunctionalized MWCNTs with BT by hydrothermal method. In the first methodology \n\nMWCNTs are covered with a titanium based solution, followed by hydrothermal reaction with \n\na Ba precursor to obtain BT on top of the MWCNTs. In the second methodology, a BT sol was \n\nused to cover MWCNTs followed by a hydrothermal reaction. A systematic study of the \n\nfabrication conditions and aspects of the synthesis is presented and the ferroelectric properties \n\nreported. \n\nWith the use of sol gel hybrid method we demonstrate the localized covering of \n\ncovalent functionalized MWCNTs with BT using hydrothermal method. However, there is \n\ndifficultly in conformal covering of MWCNTs up to large area. Therefore, we use non-covalent \n\nfunctionalize MWCNTs with SDS in order to improve the coverage area of MWCNTs with \n\nBT. The advantage of non-covalent functionalization is: it provides the large functionalized \n\narea and do not infer the electrical properties of the MWCNTs. In this context, the \n\nSDSMWCNTs-BT were fabricated via sol gel hybrid hydrothermal method and various aspects \n\nfrom synthesis to ferroelectric properties are discussed. \n\n6.2 Experimental \n\nMWCNTs used in this work were synthesised by a chemical vapor deposition technique \n\n(CVD). Prior to the coating with BaTiO3, the tubes were purified and acid treatment with 5 M \n\nHNO3 results in covalent functionalization. The average diameter and length of the tubes is \n\naround 15 - 60 nm and ~ 10 \u00b5m, respectively (for more detail refer Chapter 3 and 4).  \n\nTwo synthesis methodologies were used to cover MWCNTs with BT.  \n\nMethodology One: Based on the previously reported methodology [19], 0.1 M of \n\ntitanium solution was prepared from titanium(IV) isopropoxide (> 97 % purity, Fluka) mixed \n\nwith deionized water, acetylacetone (> 99% purity, MERCK ) and ethanol (> 99.5 % purity, \n\nPanreac) in the mol. ratio of 1:3:3:20. To minimize the presence of CO2, which may promote \n\nthe formation of BaCO3, deionized water was boiled prior to being used throughout this work. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n150 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\nMWCNTs (40 mg, 4 wt. %) were dispersed in the titanium solution using a probe ultra-\n\nsonicator (UP200S, FORLAB) for 15 min followed by bath ultra-sonication (Branson, USA, \n\n40 kHz) for 2 h. To encourage complete reaction, the solution was stirred at 70 \u00baC for 2 h, \n\nfollowed by a filtrating and heating (100 \u00baC - 24 h) until MWCNTs-TiO2 powders were \n\nobtained. The amorphous powders were heat treated at 400 \u00baC for 1 h to obtain MWCNTs \n\ncovered with crystalline TiO2 (MWCNTs - TiO2). In the second step, as-prepared MWCNTs-\n\nTiO2 were mixed with the Ba precursor solution in 1:1 mol. ratio. 0.1 M solutions of Ba acetate \n\n(99 % purity, ACS), Ba hydroxide (98 % purity, ACS) and Ba acetate with Na hydroxide (5 \n\nM) (NaOH, 98 % purity, ABCR) were used as the Ba precursors. MWCNTs-TiO2 particles \n\nwere dispersed in the Ba solution by stirring for 1 h at 30 \u00baC. The pH of the MWCNTs-BT \n\nsolution was ~10 (for the acetate and hydroxide precursors) and ~13 in case of Ba acetate with \n\nNaOH. The solutions prepared from the different Ba precursors were transferred to 70 ml \n\nteflon-lined stainless-steel autoclaves, 40 % full. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out in \n\nthe autoclave at 160 \u00baC for 12 h to obtain the final MWCNTs-BT. The MWCNTs-BT particles \n\nwere filtered and washed with distilled water until the pH of the solution came close to neutral. \n\nThe powders were dried overnight at 100 \u00baC before characterization. \n\nMethodology Two: In the second methodology, 0.1 M of BT solution was used for the \n\nsynthesis of MWCNTs-BT. Initially, a stabilized titanium solution was prepared by mixing \n\ntitanium(IV) isopropoxide (> 97 % purity, Fluka) with acetylacetone (> 99% purity, MERCK) \n\nand ethanol (> 99.5 % purity, Panreac) in mol. ratio of 1:2:5. Ba acetate solution, prepared from \n\nbarium acetate (99% purity, ACS) dissolved in deionized water (5 wt. ratio of Ba), was added \n\nto the previously prepared titanium solution. A clear and stable solution of BT was obtained \n\nafter mixing for 1 h at 70 \u00baC. 25 mg of MWCNTs were added to the BT solution which was \n\nmixed by using an ultra-high sonicator (UP 200S) for 5 min, followed by 1 to 2 h in an \n\nultrasonic bath (Branson 1510). The MWCNTs-BT solution was stirred and heated at 70 \u00baC for \n\n2 h to obtain homogeneity (a black solution, with no white precipitation). 5 M potassium \n\nhydroxide solution (KOH, ? 85 % purity, Sigma Aldrich) was added to the MWCNTs-BT \n\nsolution to promote the nucleation of BT, which was observed as the formation of white \n\namorphous precipitates.  \n\nThe precipitated MWCNTs-BT solution was transferred to a teflon lined stainless-steel \n\nautoclave, ~ 40 % full. Hydrothermal treatment was carried at time and temperatures, ranging \n\nfrom 0.5 to 24 h and 100 to 250 \u00baC. Growth and crystallization occurred under autogenous \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n151 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\npressure inside the autoclave after being subjected to various temperatures. The crystalline \n\nMWCNTs-BT powders were filtered and washed with distilled water until the pH was neutral. \n\nThe powders were dried overnight in the oven at 100 \u00baC. The various steps to obtain MWCNTs-\n\nBT in Methodologies One and Two are illustrated in Figure 6-1. \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n152 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\n \n\nFigure 6-1 Flow chart illustrates the steps followed to obtained MWCNTs-BT via (a) \n\nMethodology One and (b) Methodology Two. \n\nIn order to have better wettability, the MWCNTs were non-covalently functionalized \n\nwith sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), named as SDSMWCNTs. Procedure for functionalization \n\ndetailed in Chapter 3.  \n\nFor covering SDSMWCNTs with BT methodology two was used (sol gel hybrid \n\nhydrothermal method). Two different concentration of BT solution (0.1 and 0.01 M) were used \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n153 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\nto cover SDSMWCNTs. The SDSMWCNTs (10 mg) were added slowly to the BT solution \n\nand the solution was mixed using a probe ultra-high frequency sonicator (UP 200S) for 5 min, \n\nfollowed by sonication using a ultra-sonication bath (Branson 1510) for 2 h. SDS MWCNTs-\n\nBT solution was heated at 70 \u00baC for 2 h to get homogenous solution (a dense black solution, \n\nwith no white precipitation). The potassium hydroxide (KOH, ABCR, 85 %) solution (5 M) \n\nwas added to the SDSMWCNTs-BT solution to increase pH to 13 or above, this results in \n\nsupersaturation and nucleation occurs in the form of a white precipitate. The precipitated \n\nSDSMWCNTs-BT solution was transferred to a teflon lined stainless-steel autoclave, which \n\nwas filled up to 40 % of the total capacity and the autoclaves exposed to hydrothermal treatment \n\nto obtain SDSMWCNTs-BT powders. The obtained SDSMWCNTs-BT powders were filtered \n\nand washed by distilled water until the pH value come close to neutral. The deionized water \n\nwas boiled prior to be used throughout the experiments, in order to minimize CO2 presence, \n\nwhich may contribute to the formation of BaCO3. The obtained powders were dried in an oven \n\nat 100 \u00baC for 12 h, before being used for the characterization of the phase formation, \n\nmorphology and electrical properties.  \n\nThe obtained powders were dried in an oven at 100 \u00baC for 12 h, before being used for \n\nthe characterization of the phase formation, morphology and electrical properties. Figure 6-2 \n\nschematic illustrates the steps followed for the synthesis of SDSMWCNTs-BT. \n\nThe phase formation of BT for all samples and degree of crystallinity were assessed by \n\nX-ray diffraction (Philips, X\u00b4Pert diffractometer and Cu-K? radiation), Raman spectroscopy, \n\n(RFS100/S FT using a 534 nm excitation source) and Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) \n\nspectroscopy (Mattson, Madison, WI, USA, 7000 FTIR spectrometer). The microstructures of \n\nthe composites were analysed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi SU-70 (S-\n\n4100)), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) (300 kV Hitachi H9000-NA) and High \n\nResolution Transmission Electron Microscope (HRTEM, JEOL 2200 FS). SDSMWCNTs-BT \n\npowders for TEM were prepared by dispersing them in to the chloroform and later a drop from \n\nthe solution was transferred to TEM lacey gird (Agar). \n\nThe topography of MWCNTs-BT and SDSMWCNTs-BT was determined using \n\natomic/piezo-force microscopy whilst simultaneously obtaining local piezoelectric response \n\n(MFP-3D Asylum Research Atomic Force Microscope (AFM)). The measurements were \n\ncarried out using soft Pt-coated cantilever with spring constant of 0.1-0.4 N/m and resonance \n\nfrequency of 12 - 18 kHz (MikroMasch, XSC11). Samples for AFM/PFM were prepared by \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n154 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\ndispersing MWCNTs-BT and SDSMWCNTs-BT structures in ethanol, and depositing them on \n\nplatinised silicon substrate by spin coating. To calibrate the AFM deflection sensitivity, the \n\nforce-curve method is used- which is also used to calibrate vertical PFM. This is done by taking \n\nthe slope (in nm/V) of the linear (contact) region of a force curve, giving the distance moved \n\nby the tip, per voltage change on the photo detector.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6-2 Schematic illustrates the processing steps to obtained MWCNTs-BT \n\n(SDSMWCNTs-BT) tubes.  \n\n6.3 Results and discussion \n\n6.3.1 Covering covalent functionalized MWCNTs with BT \n\nTo follow the phase formation, MWCNTs-BT obtained from Methodology One were \n\nstudied by XRD, SEM and TEM. Figure 6-3 (a) presents the XRD pattern of MWCNTs-TiO2 \n\nheat treated 1 h at 400 \u00baC. XRD peaks match with the JCPDS #21-1272, confirming the \n\nformation of anatase. Figure 6-3 (b) shows the XRD pattern of MWCNTs-BT obtained from \n\ndifferent Ba precursors at 160 oC for 12 h. The MWCNTs-BT fabricated from Ba hydroxide \n\nprecursor results in the formation of mainly BaCO3 with only a few peaks with low intensity \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n155 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\nthat match cubic BT. XRD peaks corresponding to TiO2 were not identified, which may be due \n\nto the dissolution of TiO2 crystalline particles into Ti(OH)aq. XRD pattern obtained from \n\nMWCNTs-BT with Ba acetate precursor still exhibited BaCO3 albeit with a higher volume \n\nfraction of BaTiO3 ( Figure 6-3 (b). However, with the addition of NaOH as well as Ba acetate, \n\nthe reactivity increased [385] and monophasic BT was obtained, with no traces of carbonate in \n\nXRD pattern. \n\nSEM micrographs of MWCNTs-TiO2 show the presence of TiO2 crystalline particles \n\nabout 10 -30 nm on the surface of the MWCNTs Figure 6-4 (a). TEM micrographs from \n\nMWCNTs-BT obtained from Ba acetate-NaOH solution depict agglomerates of BT particles \n\n(150 nm) in contact with MWCNTs after hydrothermal reaction at 160 \u00baC for 12 h (Figure 6-4) \n\nbut not nucleating directly on their surface. Moreover, when Ba acetate and Ba hydroxides \n\nsolutions were used, areas with no TiO2 particles promoted the formation of BaCO3. The \n\ndetachment of TiO2 from MWCNTs during the synthesis of MWCNTs - BT can be explained \n\nby a mechanism of homogeneous dissolution and recrystallization [310] in which TiO2 \n\ndissolution into Ti(OH)aq results in the removal of TiO2 particle from the surface of MWCNTs \n\nand formation of BaTiO3 away from the surface of MWCNTs. A further reason for the \n\ndetachment of TiO2 might be weak bonding between MWCNTs and TiO2. The schematic of \n\nthe possible steps during the dissolution and recrystallization is presented in Figure 6-5.  \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n156 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\n \n\nFigure 6-3 XRD patterns of (a) MWCNTs-TiO2 particles synthesised at 400 \noC, JCPDS #21-\n\n1272 and (b) MWCNTs-BT obtained from the reaction of MWCNTs-TiO2 with different barium \n\nprecursors at 160 \u00baC for 12 h (Methodology One).

TiO2 particles detach from the MWCNTs surface, which results in the \n\nformation of BaCO3 due to the exposure of MWCNTs surface to Ba precursors. \n\nAs a consequence of the poor results obtained by pure hydrothermal synthesis, a second \n\n(Methodology Two) sol gel/hydrothermal hybrid processing route was devised. MWCNTs \n\nwere dispersed in a BT solution and exposed to hydrothermal conditions to obtain MWCNTs-\n\nBT. The phase formation of MWCNTs-BT fabricated from the hybrid sol gel / hydrothermal \n\nmethod was characterized by XRD as a function of synthesis time (Figure 6-6). All the \n\ndiffraction peaks were indexed as cubic BT (JCPDS No.: #31-0174) with lattice parameter, a \n\n= 4.031 ?. As-precipitated MWCNTs-BT powders consisted of BaCO3 phase with no \n\ncrystalline BT phase. With the processing time of 0.5 h the crystalline BT formed and its \n\ncrystallinity increased with processing time. With the increase in the synthesis time from 0.5 \n\nto 5 h the amount of BaCO3 decreased significantly, as indicated by the disappearance of the \n\nBaCO3 peak 2? = 23.09. Monophasic BT is formed at ?10 h at 160 \noC. \n\nThe cubic versus tetragonal BT phase assemblage as a function of synthesis time can \n\nbe studied from splitting of the (200) peak at 2? ~ 45 \u00ba. For MWCNTs-BT obtained at 160 \u00baC \n\n(0.5 and 2 h) the cubic phase is dominant. With the increase in the synthesis time from 5 to 24 \n\nh the peak of BaTiO3 become broader and shifts towards the right, indicating the presence of a \n\ndoublet (002 and 200) consistent with tetragonal BT (Figure 6-6 (b)). However, broadening of \n\nthe 200 peak in comparison to solid state synthesised BT [386] indicates low tetragonality (c/a \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n158 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\n? 1), possibly associated with intrinsic size effects. The largest c/a ratio was obtained for \n\nMWCNTs-BT synthesised 10 h at 160 \u00baC. \n\nThe evolution of BT phase assemblage as a function of temperature from 100 to 250 \u00baC \n\nfor a synthesis time of 2 h was also investigated, Figure 6-6 (c-d). Almost pure BT phase on \n\nthe surrounding of MWCNTs were obtained at 250 \u00baC for 2 h, whereas for lower reaction \n\ntemperature the presence of BaCO3 diffraction peaks are visible in XRD pattern (Figure 6-6 \n\n(c)). The formation of BaCO3, during the synthesis of BaTiO3 is inevitable due to its low \n\nactivation energy, in comparison to BT. However, with the further input of energy in terms of \n\nsynthesis time and temperature BaCO3 converts to BT [382]. The transformation from \n\npseudocubic to tetragonal phase was also monitored using the (200) peak at 2? ~ 45, Figure \n\n6-6 (d). MWCNTs-BT synthesised ?200 \u00baC are dominated by cubic BT but at 250 \noC the peak \n\nis shifted to the right, indicating the presence of tetragonal BT phase.  \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n159 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\n \n\n \n\n(c) \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n160 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\n \n\nFigure 6-6 XRD patterns of (a) MWCNTs-BT obtained at various synthesis time at 160 \u00baC, (b) \n\ncubic to tetragonal broadening of the 200 peak for MWCNTs-BT obtained at various synthesis \n\ntime at 160 \u00baC, (c) MWCNTs-BT obtained at various temperature for 2 h; and (d) cubic to \n\ntetragonal 200 broadening of MWCNTs-BT obtained at various temperatures for 2 h. The \n\nmaximum tetragonal phase was observed for MWCNTs-BT fabricated at 160 \u00baC for 10 h. \n\nFTIR transmittance spectra for the MWCNTs-BT derived from Methodology Two at \n\nvarious times and temperatures are depicted in Figure 6-7 (a, b). The transmittance peaks \n\naround 575 and 420 cm-1 are the fingerprint of BT, which occurred due to the stretching and \n\nbending of Ti-O-Ti octahedron [380]. The intensity and the area under this peak increased with \n\nincreasing time and temperature of synthesis. The peak at 1637 cm-1 refers to the characteristic \n\npeak of carbon skeleton (stretching of C=C) [387] which is present in all of MWCNTs-BT and \n\nits intensity does not change. Peaks at 1073 and 3438 cm-1 correspond to the functional \n\ncarboxyl and hydroxyl groups, respectively [388]. The decrease in the intensity of the carboxyl \n\nand hydroxyl peaks with the synthesis time and temperature might be due to the replacing of \n\nfunctional groups with BT crystallites. The peak at 1448 cm-1 is the signature of the carboxylate \n\n(COO-) group due to symmetric and asymmetric stretching. The intensity of the band decreases \n\nwith the increase in the synthesis time due to the decomposition of CO2 associated with the \n\nthermal degradation of carbonate impurities [389]. The peak around 864 cm-1 is the fingerprint \n\nof the carbonate phase [18]. The intensity of the carbonate peak is reduce for MWCNTs-BT \n\nwith increasing synthesis time from 0.5 min to 24 h at 160 \u00baC and as a function of increasing \n\ntemperature (100 \u00baC to 250 \u00baC) for 2 h synthesis.

Tetragonal BT depicts eight Raman active modes, 3A1g + B1g + 4Eg.[390] BT and \n\nMWCNTs-BT peaks at 180, 259 and 517 cm\n-1 are assigned to A1 symmetry transverse \n\ncomponent of the optical mode (TO modes). The peak at 304 cm-1 is assigned to the B1g mode, \n\nindicating the asymmetry within the TiO6 octahedral [390]. A high frequency longitudinal \n\noptical mode (LO) of A1 symmetry is assigned to the peak at 715 cm-1. MWCNTs-BT \n\nsynthesised at 160 oC for 10 h exhibits a clear peak at 304 cm-1, assigned to tetragonal BT, \n\nwhereas MWCNTs-BT synthesised for shorter times do not present well defined tetragonal \n\npeak at 304 cm-1. The Raman observations therefore corroborate XRD data (Figure 6-6). \n\nFigure 6-8 (b) shows the Raman spectrum for MWCNTs and MWCNTs-BT in the \n\nrange from 1200 to 1800 cm-1. MWCNTs exhibit two characteristic peaks on at 1336 and other \n\nat 1575 cm-1, named as D and G band, respectively. D band is the double resonance band that \n\ngives the information about the structural disorder and G band results from the in plane \n\ntangential stretching of the C - C bonds in the graphite sheet and gives information about the \n\ndesired graphitic structure of the tube [359]. MWCNTs-BT show both D and G band fingerprint \n\nof MWCNTs, but both characteristic peaks are shifted from their position when compared to \n\npristine MWCNTs. This most likely indicates the presence of BT on the surface of the CNTs \n\nwhich results in a compressive strain and shifts the peak to higher wavenumber. The intensity \n\nof these peaks decreased also for composite samples due to presence of BaTiO3 which restricts \n\nthe phonon interaction with the surface of CNTs [28]. \n\nThe morphology of MWCNTs-BT was then investigated by SEM, TEM and AFM. \n\nSEM (STEM mode) images of MWCNTs-BT synthesis at 160 \u00baC for 10 h reveal that there is \n\npartial coverage of the MWCNTs surface with BT (Figure 6-9 (a-b)). The dark contrast marked \n\nby the red circle in the micrograph indicates BT layers on the surface of MWCNTs. The coating \n\nthickness was estimated to be ~ 30 nm. The morphology of the MWCNTs-BT was further \n\ninvestigated by AFM (Figure 6-9 (c-d)). The topography and line profile at three different \n\nplaces (marked by crosses in Figure 6-9 (c)) on the MWCNTs-BT was imaged. The line profile \n\n(Figure 6-9 (d)) from point 1 corresponds to bare MWCNT having a diameter of 14 nm \n\n(determined from the height). The line profile at point 2 and 3 corresponds to the MWCNTs \n\ncoated with BT, with a diameter of 20 and 75 nm, respectively. It is clear from the STEM and \n\nAFM topography micrographs that the MWCNTs are partially covered with BT of varying \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n163 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\nthickness up to 2 - 100 nm. The selective coating may be due to localized covalent \n\nfunctionalization of MWCNTs that results in selective covering of MWCNTs with BT.  \n\nThe tubes were further observed using TEM. Bright field and dark field micrographs \n\nof MWCNTs-BT are illustrated in Figure 6-10 (a, b) respectively. The bright field micrograph \n\nreveals a surface coating (BT) on the MWCNTs and the accompanying dark field image reveals \n\nbright contrast from strongly diffracting regions, confirming that it is crystalline.  \n\nFigure 6-11 (a) is a HRTEM micrograph of MWCNTs, which illustrates that they are \n\nuniformly covered with BT (40 nm). Inset in Figure 6-11 (a) is a micrograph which illustrates \n\nthe carbon lattice fringes (0.33 nm), close to the theoretical value (0.34 nm) of MWCNTs [391]. \n\nIn some cases (Figure 6-11 (b)), micrographs reveal a d spacing of ~0.28 nm which corresponds \n\nto (101) BT. The arrows marked in the micrograph indicates the MWCNTs embedded inside \n\nthe BT clearly showing the expansion of carbon fringes (0.36 nm) after BT covering, indicating \n\nthey are under stress, and corroborating the observed shift in Raman peak. EDS spectra from \n\nthe MWCNTs-BT depicts the presence of Ba and Ti element, Figure 6-11 (c).

The \n\nfunctionalized surface of the MWCNTs reacts with the amorphous BT sol network and the Ba \n\nions become entrapped by the amorphous Ti. On heating, the amorphous Ti network opens and \n\nthe Ba atoms penetrate inside [363]. Consequently, there is not enough Ba ions residual in the \n\nvicinity of the Ti network to react with the carbon skeleton of MWCNTs to form BaCO3. \n\nDuring growth, amorphous sol undergoes a reaction in which movement of the gel surface is \n\nthe rate controlling step [311] resulting in the formation of crystalline BT on the surface of the \n\nMWCNTs.

The topography micrograph (Figure 6-13 (a)) represents two or more entangled \n\ntubes covered with BT.

[392] \n\nThe average value of dzz is ~15 pm/V. The hysteresis of MWCNTs-BT demonstrates that the \n\ndomains of BT on the MWCNTs can be switchable with the application of applied voltage \n\n(Figure 6-14 (c)).

In order to have uniform coverage of MWCNTs with BT, MWCNTs were \n\nfunctionalized non-covalently with SDS to promote large area functionalization. So, that \n\nconformal covering of MWCNTs with BT can be obtained. The results obtained on the \n\ncovering of non-covalent functionalized MWCNTs with BT are presented and discussed \n\nhereafter. \n\nFigure 6-15 (a) illustrates HRTEM micrographs of the SDS functionalized MWCNTs \n\nused in the present studies having diameter ranges from 10 to 30 nm. Figure 6-15 (b) represents \n\nthe SEM micrographs of SDSMWCNTs-BT synthesised at 250 \u00baC for 12 h from 0.01 M BT \n\nsolution evidencing SDSMWCNTs-BT tubes with diameter of 50 to 200 nm, alongside with \n\nthe few BT particles and uncovered MWCNTs. The SEM micrograph of SDSMWCNT-BT \n\nobtained from 0.1 M of BT solution is given in Figure 6-15 (c), SDSMWCNTs-BT obtained \n\nfrom 0.1 M of BT mainly consists of BT particles with irregular morphology and a very few \n\ntubes. It was clear from the SEM analysis that the initial concentration of BT precursor has a \n\nsignificant effect on the morphology of the final product. This can be explain based on the \n\ndifference in the concentration of the SDS and BT. When we used a high concentration of BT \n\nsolution (0.1 M) the nucleation and growth occurs in the conventional way and BT particles \n\nare formed. Whereas when BT concentration is around 0.01 M, preferential nucleation occurs \n\nat SDS molecules and BT grows from there. Hence, 1 D SDSMWCNTs-BT structures were \n\nobtained from the less concentrated BT solution.  \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n171 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\n  \n\nFigure 6-15 (a) HRTEM micrograph of SDS functionalized MWCNTs; SEM micrographs of \n\nSDSMWCNTs-BT synthesised from (b) 0.01 M and (c) 0.1 M  BT solution. BT tubes were \n\nformed when the initial concentraion of the BT solution is 0.01 M. \n\nThe 1D SDSMWCNTs-BT structures obtained from 0.01 M solution were further \n\ninvestigated under a HRTEM. The HRTEM micrograph illustrates BT tubes having the \n\ndiameter of 30, 50 and 70 nm and length up to 2 \u00b5m (Figure 6-16 (a)). Further, magnified view \n\nof the tubes depicts the presence of MWCNTs, which are embedded beneath the BT layer. The \n\nmagnified view depicts the d002 spacing of 0.2 nm that corresponds to BT crystallographic \n\nplane as shown in the inset of Figure 6-16 (b). The diameter of the SDSMWCNTs-BT tubes is \n\naround 90 nm with CNTs diameter close to 60 nm, hence the thickness of BT layer on CNTs \n\nis around 15 nm (Figure 6-16 (b)). In some SDSMWCNTs-BT tubes, the coverage of BT is so \n\ndense that it was difficult to visualize carbon skeleton of MWCNTs. The variation in the \n\ndiameter of the SDSMWCNTs-BT might be due to the difference in the original diameters of \n\nMWCNTs (10 to 60 nm) used in the present studies. The SDSMWCNTs-BT fabricated at 250 \n\noC for 2 h are illustrated in Figure 6-16 (c-d). MWCNTs (having 10 nm diameter) are uniformly \n\ncovered with BT having a diameter of ~20 nm. The magnified view of the BT covered \n\nSDSMWCNTs depicts the carbon and BT lattices with the spacing of 0.33 nm and 0.23 nm, \n\nrespectively (Figure 6-16 (c)). HRTEM results clearly proves that the MWCNTs are conformal \n\ncovered with BT and form 1D structures. HRTEM analysis at the interface between \n\nSDSMWCNTs and BT depicts three different sets of lattice spacing as illustrated in Figure \n\n6-17, having the d spacing of 0.35, 0.37 and 0.23 nm. The lattice spacing of 0.35 nm \n\ncorresponds to CNTs lattice and 0.23 nm to BT (111) plane. However, the lattice spacing of \n\n0.37 nm between CNTs and BT planes corresponds to BaCO3 (111) plane (JCPDS- 05-0378) \n\n(illustrated in Figure 6-17 inset on the top right).

According to literature the Ba(Ti2O5) is stable phase and can only \n\nbe eliminated by heating above 1100 \u00baC, and in case of hydrothermal processing it is unlikely \n\nto eliminate once it has formed. [393] To confirm, if the SDSMWCNTs-BT tubes fabricated at \n\n250 oC for 2, 12 and 48 h are tetragonal or cubic, the diffraction peak around 2?~45o were \n\nlooked for splitting or broadening. An asymmetric broadening (Figure 6-19 (b)) was found and \n\ncan be attributed to the (200)/(002) reflection of tetragonal structure for above mentioned \n\nsamples. It is know from the literature the particle size less than 300 nm attribute to the peak \n\nbroadening in contrary to splitting [320, 394].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n175 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\n  \n\nFigure 6-19 XRD pattern of the SDSMWCNTs - BT at 250 oC for 2, 12 and 48 h, fabricated \n\nfrom the initial molar concentration of 0.01 M and SDSMWCNTs-BT obtained at 250 \u00baC - 12 \n\nh from 0.1 M concentration of BT precursor (a) and the tetragonality of the SDSMWCNTs \u2013 \n\nBT for the sample fabricated at 250 oC for 2, 12 and 48 h determined from the broadening of \n\n200 peak (corresponds to cubic) in to 200/002 (corresponds to tetragonal).

Peak at 3446 cm-1 corresponds to hydroxyl \n\ngroup [388], and is present for both MWCNTs and SDSMWCNTs. The second group of peaks \n\noccur at 2977 and 2924 cm-1 and are assigned to the asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching \n\nof \u2013CH2\u2013 present in SDSMWCNTs, where pristine MWCNTs depicts only the peak assigned \n\nto the symmetrical stretching. The transmittance peaks at 1579 and 1384 cm-1 can be attributed \n\nto the monodentate carboxylate mode and symmetrical vibrations of \u2013CH3, respectively. All \n\nthe above mentioned peaks disappeared after the formation of BT on the tubes. The peak at \n\n1629 cm-1 is associated with the vibration of the carbon skeleton from the carbon nanotubes; \n\nthis peak is very clear for pristine MWCNTs and SDSMWCNTs but not so clear for \n\nSDSMWCNTS-BT. For SDSMWCNTs two more peaks are present in comparison to \n\nMWCNTs; one at 1058 cm?1 assigned to the symmetrical stretching vibration of S=O and a \n\nsecond one at 881 cm?1 assigned to the asymmetrical stretching vibration of C\u2013O\u2013S [346, 347]. \n\nAfter the formation of BT on MWCNTs, the FTIR spectra reveals a significant decrease in the \n\nintensity of the peak at 1058 cm?1 and the disappearance of the peak at 881 cm?1 what might \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n176 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\nbe due to the formation of BT by the replacing of the sulphur ions (from SDS). The huge \n\ntransmittance peak for SDSMWCNTS-BT at 1442 cm?1 may corresponds to carboxylate \n\ngroups [18]. The characteristic peaks for BT that appears around 418 and 563 cm-1 are from \n\nthe stretching and bending of the Ti-O octahedron of BT [380]. Peak around 856 cm-1 is from \n\nthe carbonate phase, indicating the formation of BaCO3. In agreement with HRTEM analysis \n\nof SDSMWCNTs-BT reveals the formation of BaCO3 at the interface of MWCNTs. The \n\nformation of BaCO3 may results in deficiency of Ba ions in the solution that as a consequence \n\nmight result in the formation of secondary phases, Ba(Ti2O5) and TiO2, as it was observed. \n\n \n\nFigure 6-20 FTIR spectra of MWCNTs, SDSMWCNTs and SDSMWCNTs-BT, depicts the SDS \n\nfunctionalized peaks at 1058 and 881 cm-1 and characteristic peaks for the formation of BT at \n\n563 and 418 cm-1. \n\nFrom the above analysis, a schematic is proposed on the formation of 1D \n\nSDSMWCNTs-BT (Figure 6-21). MWCNTs functionalized with SDS results in the non-\n\ncovalent functionalization. Where the  hydrophobic part (C-C chain) of the SDS is adsorbed \n\non the MWCNTS by Van Der Waals interactions and the hydrophilic part of the surfactant is \n\noriented toward the aqueous phase [395]. SDS functionalization make CNTs stiffer due to the \n\nrigidity of the SDS and align them unidirectionally, this also provide with better dispersion of \n\nMWCNTs in solution. [396, 397] It has been experimentally and theoretically verified that \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n177 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) \u2013 Barium titanate (BT) \n\nSDS molecules adsorbed on the CNTs based on chirality and electrical properties [398, 399]. \n\nMoreover, SDS adsorbed on the surface of MWCNTs in three different type, named as \n\ncylindrical adsorption, hemimicellar adsorption and random adsorption (shown in Figure 6-21), \n\nThis dependents on the concentration of SDS in the media [400] and on the size and chirality \n\nof the tubes, as stated above. This could be the reason that not all the MWCNTs are conformal \n\ncovered with SDS due to different size of the MWCNTs used in the present studies and also \n\nthe chirality.  \n\nFTIR of SDSMWCNTs-BT indicates the intensity of transmittance band from S=O and \n\nC-O-S has been extinct and decrease in intensity after the formation of BT. It indicates the S=O \n\nwas replaced by Ti-O network during the nucleation and/or growth process, this results in the \n\ndeposition of BT on the surface of MWCNTs. The nucleation and growth of the BT on the \n\nsurface of MWCNTs might be dependent on the type of adsorption of SDS on the MWCNTs. \n\nThis might be the reason, why some of the tubes are uniformly covered with BT, few of them \n\npartially and others are not at all.  \n\nThe formation of secondary phase Ba(Ti2O5) and TiO2 occurred due to the deficiency \n\nof Ba ions in the solution, which is only possible if the Ba ions from the suspension form BaO \n\nor BaCO3. HRTEM results depicts the formation of BaCO3 at the interface of SDSMWCNTs-\n\nBT. The possible reason for the formation of BaCO3 phase at the interface is due to aliphatic \n\nchains (C-C) of SDS, Which reacts with Ba ions to form BaCO3. Nevertheless, in our previous \n\nstudies we demonstrated that sol gel hybrid hydrothermal method restrict the formation of \n\nBaCO3 for the fabrication of MWCNTs-BT. But it seems same is not true when surfactant with \n\nlong aliphatic chains present along the periphery of the MWCNTs.  \n\nThe topography and out of plane PFM amplitude and phase response with the respective \n\nline profile presented on the right of the Figure 6-22 (a-c).

The linear \n\nincrease of the amplitude with the applied voltage are observed, which is typical response \n\nexpected from the piezoelectric materials. Where, the slope obtained from amplitude vs Vac \n\nplot (illustrate as inset in Figure 6-23) and force is calculated from the force calibration curve. \n\nThe average value of d33 is approximately 2 pm/V which is quite low compare to the bulk (d33 \n\n= 75 pm/V) [401].  \n\n \n\nFigure 6-23 Amplitude as a function of applied voltage (Vac) plot for SDSMWCNTs-BT; \n\nillustrates the linear change in amplitude with applied voltage and the slope gives the value of \n\neffective d33, in this case it is around 2 pm/V. \n\n  \n\nFigure 6-24 (a) Hysteresis loops and (b) amplitude obtained from SDSMWCNTs-BT tube with \n\nthe application of \u00b150 V dc bias.

The reason for low value of d33 might be \n\nthe orientation of the domains in BT, which is explained  by caring out systematic \n\nmeasurements on thin films by PFM [392]. \n\nLocal piezoelectric hysteresis measurements were recorded to demonstrate the \n\nferroelectric behaviour of the tubes. Figure 6-24 (a) and (b) depicts the hysteresis phase loop \n\nand amplitude response from the SDSMWCNTs-BT, respectively. The hysteresis phase and \n\namplitude loops were acquired by scanning with dc bias \u00b1 50 V. A square hysteresis phase loop \n\nand butterfly amplitude loop were observed, this indicate the tubes are ferroelectric in nature. \n\nThe self-polarization of the SDSMWCNTs-BT is clearly indicated by the shift of phase \n\nhysteresis loop along the positive side of the applied bias. The PFM studies on tubes established \n\nthat SDSMWCNTs-BT indicates they are ferroelectric in nature.  \n\n6.4 Conclusions  \n\nThe present studies demonstrate an low cost methodology of coating covalent \n\nfunctionalized MWCNTs with BT using a sol-gel hybrid hydrothermal method and succinctly \n\nillustrates the ineffectiveness of conventional hydrothermal synthesis due the formation of \n\nBaCO3. The MWCNTs-BT are ferroelectric and exhibit an electromechanical response (15 \n\npm/V). However, the covering of MWCNTs is local and non-uniform what might be related to \n\nthe covalent functionalization of MWCNTs.  \n\nFurther studies on non-covalent functionalized MWCNTs demonstrated a more \n\nconformal covering of SDSMWCNTs with BT using sol gel hybrid hydrothermal method. \n\nHRTEM showed that SDSMWCNTs-BT have diameters ranging from 20 to 200 nm. The local \n\nPFM response proves that MWCNTs-BT tubes are ferroelectric and piezoelectric with d33 of \n\n2 pm/V. \n\nThis strategy can also be extended to the other compounds for materials with high \n\ncrystallisation temperatures. The formation of nano composites of BT on MWCNTs is a \n\nsignificant step forward in the development of 3D memory cells. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n181 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\nChapter 7 \n7 Multiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO)  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n182 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\n \n\nAbstract:  \n\nThis chapter demonstrates the fabrication of MWCNTs- BiFeO3 (BFO) structures. \n\nMWCNTs-BFO structures were obtained by two approaches: chemical solution \n\ndeposition method (sol gel) and physical method (sputtering). In the first approach \n\nMWCNTs were used to fabricate 1D structures of MWCNTs-BFO from a sol gel solution \n\nof BFO. It was found that MWCNTs provides the critical role in the fabrication of \n\nmonophasic BFO by curbing the formation of secondary phase (Bi2O3). TEM \n\nobservations clearly illustrate that opening and semi filling of MWCNTs with BFO \n\nprecursor occurs during the processing of MWCNTs-BFO. Through the annealing \n\nprocess of MWCNTs-BFO to obtained crystalline BFO the MWCNTs were completely \n\noxidized and 1D BFO monophasic nano rod like structures were formed. The BFO nano \n\nrod like structures, mimicking the morphology of the MWCNTs, have crystallites with \n\nan aspect ratio of 1:3 or above, and diameters in the range of ~20 - 50 nm. BFO nano rod \n\nlike structures depicted a weak ferromagnetic loop with coercive field of 956 Oe at 5 K.  \n\nIn the second approach, Vertically Aligned MWCNTs (VA-MWCNTs) as bottom \n\nelectrodes for microelectronics were used. As a proof of concept BFO films were \n\nfabricated by in-situ deposition on the surface of VA-MWCNTs by RF magnetron \n\nsputtering. In-situ deposition temperature of 400 \u00baC and deposition time up to 2 h was \n\nused, BFO films cover the VA-MWCNTs and no damage occurs either in the film or VA-\n\nMWCNTs. In spite of the macroscopic lossy polarization behaviour, the ferroelectric \n\nnature, domain structure and switching of these conformal BFO films were verified by \n\npiezo force microscopy. G type antiferromagnetic ordering with weak ferromagnetic \n\nordering loop was proved for BFO films on VA-MWCNTs, having a coercive field of \n\n700 Oe. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n183 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n7.1 Introduction \n\nRecently special attention has been paid to materials, designated as multiferroics \n\nthat possess two or more ferroic properties, as ferroelectricity, ferroelasticity and \n\nferromagnetism. The possibility of combining and controlling two different physical \n\nphenomena in a single material is indeed considered the epitome of functionality. \n\nMultiferrroics are because of that very promising from the technological pointy of view \n\nfor modern electronics, as memory elements, sensors, and spintronics. Bismuth ferrite is \n\none of the few single phase multiferroic materials. BFO has a rhombohedral distorted \n\nperovskite structure with space group of R3c and displays ferroelectricity below ~ 830 oC \n\nand antiferromagnetism below 370 oC [163]. BFO has a very large intrinsic polarization \n\n(theoretically predicted to be as high as ~100 ?C/cm2) [403] and room \u2013 temperature \n\nmultiferroism. This predicted high switching polarization is indeed higher than the one of \n\nthe most commercialised ferroelectric materials for memory applications (PZT based \n\ncompositions). So besides the multiferroic properties and due to the large remanent \n\npolarization BFO is a promising material for applications in which polarization switching \n\nis required (as memory applications). Indeed BFO is the ferroelectric material of Fujitsu \n\n256 Mb FeRAMs [207]. However, high dielectric losses, leakage current and tendency to \n\nfatigue are the main hurdles to overcome for any kind of electronic applications.  \n\nHowever, the practical application of BFO is hinder due to high leakage current attributed \n\nto the co-existence of Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions along with oxygen vacancies [404]. In addition \n\nthe formation of secondary phases Bi2O3, Fe2O3, Bi2Fe4O9, and Bi25FeO39 [405] make it \n\ndifficult to achieve significant superior multiferroic properties. \n\nThe synthesis of monophasic BFO is difficult due to the particular kinetics and \n\nthermodynamic properties of Bi2O3 \u2013 Fe2O3 system. Using solid state reaction methods \n\nis extremely hard to obtained pure BFO. Various modified synthesis approaches has been \n\nused to obtained monophasic BFO such as microwave sintering [406], liquid sintering \n\n[404], plasma assisted sintering [407] and mechanochemical methods [408] as well as \n\nvarious chemical methods such as co-precipitation [409] and hydrothermal [410]. Some \n\nof these methodologies have found some success in achieving pure BFO but no definite \n\nreaction mechanism for obtaining pure BFO phase has been identified yet. In order to \n\nstabilize the perovskite structure and to lower the conductivity of BFO doping with \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n184 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\ndifferent elements has also been reported and revealing promising results [411]. \n\nNevertheless, synthesis a stoichiometric BFO and understanding the reaction process is \n\nstill a point of open discussion among researchers.  \n\nDue to the technological importance of nano structured materials, efforts have \n\nbeen made to fabricate nano structures of BFO [412, 413]. Various chemical methods \n\nhave been used to fabricate 1D BFO structures, broadly, distinguished as template and \n\ntemplate free methods. Details on some of these methodologies have been given in \n\nChapter 2 of this thesis. In template methods, a sacrificial template is usually Anodic \n\nAluminum Oxide (AAO). These templates are filled with BFO solution followed by \n\nannealing (500 - 600 \u00baC) and removing of template carried out by chemical or by thermal \n\netching to obtain 1D BFO structures [414]. However, BFO reacts with AAO template and \n\nforms secondary phases, which results in poor properties. 1D BFO structures have also \n\nbeen obtained by template free method using electrospinning, hydrothermal and \n\ncombustion methods [415-417]. The use of BFO 1D nano structures have been also \n\ndemonstrated for 3D memory cells by depositing BFO on ZnO nano rods by RF sputtering \n\nusing LaNiO3 as a buffer layer at 450 \u00baC; these nano structures depict piezoelectric \n\ncoefficient (d33) of 33 pmV\n-1 and a polarization of 133 \u00b5C/cm-2 [418]. CNTs with \n\nextraordinary electrical and mechanical properties make them a typical choice as a \n\nmaterial for future microelectronic devices. The detailed literature review on CNTs for \n\nelectronics and CNTs-FE composites is presented in Chapter 2. On a short note, CNTs \n\nare seen as possible alternative to the expensive indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates used \n\nin solar cells [419] or as channel material in FETs [11, 30]. More recently, vertical aligned \n\nMWCNTs were also coated with SrTiO3 (STO) by pulse laser deposition, in order to \n\nreduce the work function of CNTs so that electron field emission can be controlled for \n\nFET applications. Here the main purpose was the coverage of a carpet type layer of CNTs, \n\ninstead of individual CNTs. However, the authors did not address synthesis and phase \n\nformation [30]. \n\nThere are no studies on the fabrication of MWCNTs -BFO heterostructures or the \n\nuse of MWCNTs as templates to fabricate BFO nano structures using chemical or \n\nphysical methods. Therefore, we studied the use of chemical solution method and \n\nphysical method to fabricate MWCNTs-BFO nano structures by sol gel and RF \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n185 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\nsputtering, respectively. A comprehensive study on the phase formation, interface, \n\nelectrical and magnetic properties is addressed in this chapter.  \n\n7.2 Experimental \n\nApproach one: sol gel method to cover covalent functionalized MWCNTs \n\nPrior to the fabrication of MWCNTs-BFO structures a sol gel solution of BFO \n\nwas prepared. 0.2 M BFO solution was obtained by mixing at room temperature in the \n\nstoichiometric proportions (1:1) bismuth(III) nitrate (BiNO3.5H2O, ? 98 %, Sigma \n\nAldrich) and iron(III) nitrate (Fe(NO3)3.9H2O, ? 98 %, Sigma Aldrich). Each precursor \n\nwas dissolved in deionised water (5 ml each) before mixing to get a transparent BFO \n\nsolution. Later, nitric acid (65 %, Panreac) as a solvent and citric acid (? 99.5 %, Merck) \n\nas a chelating agent were added to the BFO solution in the molar ratio of 20:5. At this \n\nstage the solution was light yellow in colour. This solution was mixed at 70 oC with \n\nvigorous stirring for 2 h before being used for the synthesis of 1D BFO. Covalent \n\nfunctionalized MWCNTs were used in this work (details about the MWCNTs are \n\npresented in Chapter 3). \n\nMWCNTs-BFO powders were obtained by uniformly dispersing 10 mg of \n\nMWCNTs in 10 ml of BFO solution by ultra-sonication for 2 h (Branson, USA, 40 kHz) \n\nresulting in a dense black solution. The solution was refluxed at 100 oC for 2 h, during \n\nthis process NO2 was evaporated, and the total volume of solution reduced. The solution \n\nwas further heat treated in the oven (150 \u00baC for 2 h) to get dried powders of MWCNTs-\n\nBFO. The obtained amorphous powders of MWCNTs-BFO were annealed at various \n\ntemperatures, from 300 up to 550 oC and time period of 2 h to obtained crystalline nano \n\nstructures of MWCNTs-BFO. BFO solution (without CNTs) was also used to obtain BFO \n\npowders for comparison purposes. Figure 7-1 illustrates the steps to produce MWCNTs-\n\nBFO and BFO powders from sol gel solution.  \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n186 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\nFigure 7-1Flow chart illustrates the steps followed to synthesised MWCNTs-BFO and \n\nBFO powders. \n\nApproach two: covering Vertically Aligned (VA)-MWCNTs with BFO by \n\nsputtering \n\nBismuth(III) oxide (Bi2O3, Riedel-deHa\u00ebn, 99.5 %) and iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3, \n\nMerck 99 %), powders were used as precursors for the synthesis of BiFeO3 targets. The \n\npowders were mixed according to the BFO stoichiometry in a ball miller for 24 h using \n\nethanol as media. The mixed powders were dried in an oven at 100 oC for 24 h followed \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n187 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\nby a calcination step at 720 oC for 3 h. The BFO calcined powders were then ball milled \n\nfor 5 h to obtain a finer particle size distribution. Next, these powders were uniaxially \n\npressed in a 2 inch diameter die with an applied pressure of 1-5 MPa and finally heat \n\ntreated at 800 \u00baC for 4 h to obtain a dense ceramic target for sputtering.

BFO deposition was carried out in a RF sputtering unit \n\n(CRIOLAB - Equipamento Criog\u00e9nico e de Laborat\u00f3rio Lda) at different temperatures \n\nand exposure times in an atmosphere of argon / oxygen with a flow rate of 15 and 5 sccm, \n\nrespectively, and a working pressure of 7x10-4 Torr.

For the \n\nDTA/TG analysis alumina crucibles were used, and the measurements carried out up to \n\n500 \u00baC with a heating rate of 5 \u00baC/min. In-situ X-Ray diffraction measurements as a \n\nfunction of the temperature were performed using Panalytical X\u2019pert-Pro powder \n\ndiffractometer. The diffraction patterns were acquired from 10 \u00b0 to 60 \u00b0 (2?) with a step \n\nlength of 0.02o. A platinum substrate was used for in-situ studies, which were carried out \n\nup to 550 \u00baC in air with an heating rate of 5 oC/min. Ex-situ XRD (Rigaku, Geigerflex \n\nD/Max-C, Cu K?) was used to characterize MWCNTs-BFO and VA-MWCNTs-BFO \n\nfabricated at different temperatures. MWCNTs-BFO and VA-MWCNTs-BFO were \n\ncharacterized by Raman in a HR 800, Jobin Yvon spectrometer, using the excitation lines \n\nof 532 nm. Scanning electron microscope ((SEM), Hitachi S4100), Transmission electron \n\nmicroscope ((TEM), Hitachi H9000-NA) and High Resolution TEM ((HRTEM), JEOL \n\n2200) were used to study the morphology of the nano structures obtained by sol gel \n\nmethod and sputtering. The power samples of MWCNTs-BFO and VA-MWCNTs-BFO \n\nwere dispersed in chloroform and transfer to Cu grids for TEM analysis. The dielectric \n\nresponse of VAMWCNTs-BFO were measured using a precision LCR (inductor \n\ncapacitor resistor) meter (Model HP4284A) connected to a PC via a GPIB card and \n\nworking in the frequency range from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. P-V loops were measured in a \n\nferroelectric test system (aixACCT, TF ANALYZER 1000 Measurement System). \n\nTopography analysis and local piezoelectric response was measured using a MFP-3D \n\nAsylum Research Atomic Force Microscope, equipped with Zurich Instruments (HF2LI) \n\nexternal lock-in amplifier and a Tektronix (AGF320) function generator for BFO \n\ndeposited on VAMWCNTs.

Magnetic hysteresis loops were measured at room temperature as well as 5 K in \n\nthe field of 10 T for MWCNTs-BFO. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n189 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n7.3 Results and Discussion \n\n7.3.1 Approach one: MWCNTs-BFO fabricated by sol gel method \n\nDTA/TG analysis of amorphous powders of BFO and MWCNTs-BFO are \n\npresented in Figure 7-3. DTA curves depict one endothermic peak followed by three \n\nexothermic ones for BFO and MWCNTs-BFO in the temperature range 100 to 350 oC, \n\nrespectively (Figure 7-3). The endothermic and exothermic peaks in between 100 to 175 \n\noC correspond to the evaporation of water and solvent for both powders. The total weight \n\nloss is ~6 % as from the TG analysis (marked as region I) (Figure 7-3). The next two \n\nexothermic peaks for BFO and MWCNTs-BFO at 230 oC and 330 oC are associated with \n\nthe decomposition of organics used in the preparation. The weight loss in the range of \n\n175 oC and 350 oC is around ~32 % for BFO and MWCNTs-BFO (region II and III). The \n\nDTA depicts two exothermic peaks for BFO and three exothermic peaks for MWCNTs-\n\nBFO in the region of 350 to 500 oC, respectively, highlighted and magnified view is \n\nillustrated as an inset in Figure 7-3 (a). In-situ XRD with temperature was performed on \n\nMWCNTs-BFO (Figure 7-3 (b)) and BFO (Figure 7-3 (c)) powders under the same \n\nconditions as in DTA/TG, to identify the phase formation. According to the in-situ XRD, \n\nBFO phase appears at 450 \u00baC for both powders and the crystallinity of the phase improved \n\nfurther with the temperature (matched with JCPDS 20 - 0169). By comparing the phase \n\nformation results obtained from in-situ XRD with DTA for MWCNTs-BFO and BFO it \n\nis clear that the exothermic peak that starts at 438 oC and continues up to 450 oC \n\ncorresponds to the formation of the BFO phase. TG curve depicts small weight loss less \n\nthan 1 % for BFO and around 2-3 % for MWCNTs-BFO curve in the range from 425 and \n\n500 \u00baC, which might be due to the evaporation of some residual solvents; and in the case \n\nof MWCNTs-BFO the additional weight loss may correspond to the oxidation of \n\nMWCNTs. The oxidation of MWCNTs has been studied for the tubes used in the present \n\nstudies, according to which MWCNTs start to oxidized at 420 \u00baC in air (Chapter 4). There \n\nare few exothermic peaks before and after the BFO exothermic peak (438 \u00baC) for BFO \n\nand MWCNTs-BFO (Figure 7-3 (a)). These peaks may correspond to the formation of \n\nintermediate and/or secondary phases. Unfortunately the XRD peaks corresponding to \n\nsecondary and intermediate phases were not observed in the in-situ XRD investigation. \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n190 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n191 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\nFigure 7-3 (a) DTA/TG analysis of BFO and MWCNTs-BFO powders, (b) in-situ XRD of \n\nMWCNTs-BFO and (c) BFO with heating rate of 5 \u00baC/min. DTA and in-situ XRD results \n\nconfirms the BFO formation at 450 \u00baC.  \n\nFurther, BFO and MWCNTs-BFO were studied by ex-situ XRD as a function of \n\nannealing temperature and time of 2 h (Figure 7-4). The XRD analysis illustrate that \n\nrombohedral BFO with R3c space group was formed at 350 \u00baC for BFO and MWCNTs-\n\nBFO, where diffraction peaks corresponds to the JCPDS 20 - 0169. BFO and MWCNTs-\n\nBFO annealed at 350 \u00baC depicts the presence of intermediate phases Bi2O3 and ? FeO. \n\nHowever, the amount of Bi2O3 is small for MWCNTs-BFO heat treated at 350 \u00baC for 2 h \n\nin comparison with BFO prepared under the same conditions. With the further increase \n\nin annealing temperature to 420 \u00baC almost monophasic BFO was obtained for MWCNTs-\n\nBFO. Whereas, for BFO the intensity of the Bi2O3 peak has increased with annealing \n\ntemperature from 350 to 420 \u00baC. Further increase in annealing temperature (500 \u00baC) for \n\nBFO depicts the formation of additional bismuth rich secondary phase Bi25FeO39. The \n\nformation of secondary phase with increasing annealing temperature has been reported in \n\ndifferent studies, as referred in the introduction.  \n\n(c) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n192 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\nFigure 7-4 Ex-situ XRD pattern for BFO and MWCNTs-BFO powders annealed at 350 \n\nand 420 \u00baC for 2 h. Monophasic BFO was obtained for MWCNTs-BFO after annealing \n\nat 420 \u00baC for 2 h. BFO annealed at 500 oC depicts the bismuth rich phase Bi25FeO39, \n\nwhere-as the BFO and MWCNTs-BFO depicts the Bi2O3 and FeO as secondary phase. \n\nThe presence of MWCNTs reduce the oxygen pressure due to the oxidation of MWCNTs \n\nat annealing temperature of 420 oC hence curb the formation of Bi2O3 phase.  \n\nThe ex-situ XRD answered some of the questions raised from DTA analysis on \n\nthe unidentified exothermic peaks. The ex-situ XRD confirms that the exothermic peak, \n\nbetween 400 and 425 \u00baC, observed before the BFO formation might correspond to the \n\nformation of Bi2O3 (intermediate phase), and the same is true for MWCNTs-BFO. It is \n\nknown from reported studies that a reducing oxygen pressure plays an important role on \n\nrestricting the formation of Bi2O3 during the fabrication of BFO [420]. In the present \n\ninvestigation monophasic BFO phase was obtained for MWCNTs-BFO with the \n\nannealing temperature of 420 \u00baC for 2 h. This might be due to the oxidation of CNTs, \n\nwhich create a reducing atmosphere and results in the lack of oxygen for the formation of \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n193 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\nBi2O3 phase. On the contrary, MWCNTs-BFO anneal at 350 \u00baC depicts Bi2O3; this \n\nannealing temperature is below the oxidation temperature of MWCNTs, result ing in the \n\nformation of Bi2O3.  \n\nDTA of MWCNTs-BFO presents an additional exothermic peak between 350 and \n\n400 oC, which corresponds to the oxidation of MWCNTs. In our previous work on the \n\nthermal stability of MWCNTs, it was observed that MWCNTs start to oxidize at 420 \u00baC \n\nin air. However, the presence of impurities can lower the oxidation temperature of \n\nMWCNTs [421], moreover during the refluxing of MWCNTs in the nitric solution, the \n\ntubes were severely damaged as observed in the TEM. This might also account for the \n\nearly oxidation of CNTs. The decrease in oxidation temperature for MWCNTs treated in \n\nnitric acid for different time interval has also been reported recently [422]. This result \n\ncorroborates our observation that the exothermic peak between 350 and 400 \u00baC \n\ncorresponds to the oxidation of MWCNTs; therefore no carbon nanotubes remain after \n\nthe annealing of MWCNTs-BFO at 420 oC for 2 h. \n\nRaman spectroscopy is an important tool for the characterization of CNTs. The \n\nRaman spectra of CNTs usually exhibits three characteristic bands for MWCNTs. The \n\ntangential stretching of carbon atoms results in G band (1500 -1600 cm-1), that is a \n\ncharacteristic feature of the graphitic layers. The second and third characteristic bands are \n\nfrom defective graphitic structures, named as D mode (~1330 cm-1) and D\u00b4 band (1610 \n\ncm-1) [423]. In the present work, the Raman spectra for MWCNTs and MWCNTs-BFO \n\n(before annealing) were studied (Figure 7-5). All the characteristic bands of MWCNTs \n\n(G, D and D\u00b4 band) are marked in the spectra. MWCNTs and MWCNTs-BFO (before \n\nannealing) depict all the three characteristic peaks as mentioned above. There is no \n\nsignificant Raman peak shift for MWCNTs after being covered with BFO. However, the \n\nintensity of both D and G band is reduced for MWCNTs-BFO in comparison to \n\nMWCNTs, due to the less number of photons that interacts with the C-C skeleton of \n\nMWCNTs. The MWCNTs-BFO annealed at 420 \u00baC for 2 h does not depict the \n\ncharacteristic peaks for MWCNTs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n194 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\nFigure 7-5 Raman spectra for functionalized MWCNTs and MWCNTs-BFO (before \n\nannealing). After the deposition of BFO solution on MWCNTs the intensity of the \n\ncharacteristic CNTs peaks were reduced and no peak shift was observed.  \n\nMWCNTs-BFO before and after heat treatment were characterized by electron \n\nmicroscopy. BiFeO3 amorphous particles are present on the surface as well as inside the \n\ntubes, as depicted in Figure 7-6 (a). Magnified HRTEM micrograph from one of the tubes \n\nillustrates the presence of amorphous BFO particles along the walls, as well as inside the \n\ntubes, marked by arrows in Figure 7-6 (b). The inset in Figure 7-6 (b) depicts the \n\nmagnified view of MWCNTs tip; tips were oxidized what might have occurred during \n\nthe refluxing in nitric suspension at 100 \u00baC, permitting the partially filling of MWCNTs \n\nwith BFO solution.  \n\nThe process of opening and filling of MWCNTs is possible by two approaches; \n\nwet chemical and physical methods. In the wet-chemistry approach the cap of CNTs can \n\nbe removed by refluxing in nitric basic suspensions of the metal oxide and simultaneous \n\nfilling of metal salts took place what is highly depended on the wetting capabilities. The \n\nopening of CNTs with nitric acid was first demonstrated by Tsang et al [118] that used \n\nthis approach to fill in the tubes with various metals from their respective nitrate \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n195 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\nprecursors. The use of nitric solution results in the removal of the MWCNTs cap due to \n\nits weak sp3 hybridization in comparison to strong sp2 hybridization of the walls. The \n\nsecond approach, the physical method is a two-step process; in the first step the cap of \n\nCNTs is removed by thermal oxidation and in the second one, CNTs without caps are \n\nimmersed inside the metal solution, resulting in the filling [424]. In both methods the \n\nfilling of tubes occurred through capillary forces. Ugarta et al have demonstrated that \n\nliquids with lower surface tension (&lt;190 mN/m) are effective for filling and wetting the \n\nnanotubes, being nitrates salts among them [120]. \n\nIn the present work, the oxidation of CNTs cap and partial filling of MWCNTs \n\noccurred due to refluxing of nitric acid followed by the filling and wetting of MWCNTs, \n\nin a single step. 1D structures formed after annealing at 420 oC are illustrated in Figure \n\n7-6 (c,d). SEM micrograph depicts the 1D structure of MWCNTs-BFO having a diameter \n\nin the range of 10 \u2013 100 nm but the morphology of the tubes is not uniform. TEM studies \n\nconfirm the formation of 1D BFO structure and crystalline BFO attached together to form \n\n1D morphology. The tip of the 1D MWCNTs-BFO structure is irregular and widen; this \n\nis due to the presence of excess amount of precursor at the open end of the tubes, result ing \n\nin the formation of irregular \u201cmouth\u201d. From SEM and TEM micrographs it looks like that \n\nthe 1D structure is formed due to attachments of nano size crystals. These crystals were \n\nfurther analysed under HRTEM. \n\n \n\n  \n\n(b) (a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n196 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n  \n\nFigure 7-6 TEM micrographs of MWCNTs-BFO before annealing: (a) MWCNTs coated \n\nwith BFO solution, (b) a detail of a MWCNT coated with BiFeO3 solution showing \n\namorphous particles deposited on the walls and inside the tubes; inset illustrates the \n\nmagnified view of MWCNT where the CNTs lattice along the cap has been oxidized. \n\nMWCNTs-BFO after annealing at 420 \u00baC for 2 h: (c) SEM micrograph illustrate the nano \n\nstructure of BFO and (d) TEM micrograph represents the BFO nano structures with non-\n\nuniform thickness all along the structures. \n\nHRTEM micrographs of 1D MWCNTs-BFO annealed at 420 oC depict the \n\npresence of various crystalline 1D particles with aspect ratio of 1:3 and above.

The \n\nCNTs lattices were not observed during the HRTEM investigation of MWCNTs-BFO. \n\nThis corroborates the findings of Raman and supports our discussion on the role of \n\nMWCNTs oxidation on the formation of monophasic BFO. From the morphology of \n\ncrystalline BFO it can be concluded that MWCNTs acted as a template for the fabrication \n\nof 1D BFO. Chemical composition of MWCNTs-BFO investigated by energy dispersive \n\nX-Ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra (inset in Figure 7-7 (b)) confirms the presence of \n\nbismuth and iron elements in the composite; the additional peaks such as Cu are from the \n\nTEM grid. \n\n(d) (c) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n197 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\n   \n\nFigure 7-7 HRTEM micrograph of MWCNTs-BFO annealed at 420 oC for 2 h (a) depicts \n\ncrystalline particles with aspect ratio of 1:3 and above; the inset illustrates the lattice \n\nspacing of this crystalline particle as 0.28 nm (b) magnified view from the BFO nano \n\nstructure depicts 1D crystallites and inset illustrate EDS spectra confirm the presence of \n\nbismuth and iron elements.

MWCNTs-BFO at room temperature with \n\nmagnetization at 10 K Oe field is nearly 0.9 emu/g and 2Hc of 514 Oe, as illustrated in \n\ninset of Figure 7-8. The unsaturated hysteresis loop from MWCNTs-BFO with weak \n\nferromagnetic behaviour is similar to one reported for BFO wires [425], different from \n\nthe bulk BFO. The average diameter of the BFO wires is around 30 nm, which is lower \n\nthan the wavelength (62 nm) of the in commensurate spiral spin structure. The BFO \n\nparticles with size less than 62 nm possess weak ferromagnetic properties due to size \n\nconfinement effect where the antiferromagnetic order is frequently interrupted at the \n\nparticle surface. These confinements partially destroy the spiral spin structure and results \n\nin the weak ferromagnetic ordering.  \n\nAt low temperature (5 K) the size effect is more significant, from the broadening \n\nof the M-H curve and increase in magnetization values from 0.9 emu/g (300 K) to 2.2 \n\nemu/g, as well as cohesive field (2Hc) from 514 Oe to 956 Oe, respectively. The increase \n\nof magnetization values at low temperature is the result from the cycloid structure which \n\nis more an harmonic at lower temperature and its detrimental effect on the magnetic \n\nordering is diminished [426]. Therefore, in the MWCNTs-BFO nanowires, the spin \n\nrelaxation from the spatially modulated anti ferromagnetic configuration can be quite \n\nsignificant, resulting in weak ferromagnetic behaviours and enhanced M at low \n\ntemperature. \n\n \n\nFigure 7-8 Magnetic M-H hysteresis loops of MWCNTs-BFO at 300 and 5 K, where the \n\ninset gives a magnified view of the loop near the origin.

The BFO target depicts \n\nalmost pure BFO rhombohedral phase with minor amounts of secondary phases \n\n(Bi2Fe4O9, Bi25FeO40). The diffraction peaks from the planes (012), (104), (110), (113), \n\n(006), (202) and (211) are indexed to the R3c crystal symmetry. At 350 \u00baC the deposited \n\nBFO is amorphous as seen by XRD. BFO deposited on VA-MWCNTs at 400 \u00baC for 1 \n\nand 2 h is almost monophasic, with trace amounts of Bi2O3 (Figure 7-9 (a)). To note that \n\nBi2O3 does not have significant effect on the magnetic properties, while increasing the \n\nconductivity of the film [427]. Moreover, its amount can be reduced by changing the \n\noxygen partial pressure [420]. As the growth temperature increases from 400 \u00baC to 600 \n\n\u00baC, formation of the non-perovskite phase Bi2Fe4O9 takes place (Figure 7-9 (a)). Indeed \n\nthere is a very narrow temperature window in which pure monophasic BFO can be \n\nobtained, depending on the processing parameters [428] and purity of the reagents [429]. \n\nSecondary phases such as Bi2Fe4O9 and Bi25FeO40 reduce significantly the electrical \n\nresponse, therefore they should be avoided. In addition, BFO sputtered on VA-MWCNTs \n\nat room temperature and later annealed at 500 \u00baC (ex-situ) in air and in flowing nitrogen \n\ndepicts Bi2O3 as the major phase with small amounts of BFO and Bi2Fe4O9, as observed \n\nby XRD (Figure 7-9 (b)). Considering the above, BFO films deposited at 400 \u00baC on VA-\n\nMWCNTs were used for further characterization.  \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n200 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n  \n\nFigure 7-9 XRD pattern of BFO target and BFO films on VA-MWCNTs fabricated in-situ \n\nat 400 oC - 1 h, 400 oC - 2 h and 600 oC - 1 h. With the increase in deposition temperature \n\nto 600 \u00baC secondary phases are well visible and (b) XRD of BFO deposited on VA-\n\nMWCNTs followed by annealing at 500 \u00baC \u2013 2 h in air shows poor crystallization and \n\ndomination of secondary phases. \n\nThe optical micrographs of VA-MWCNTs and BFO on VA-MWCNTs are \n\nrepresented in Figure 7-10 (a,b). The complete covering of VA-MWCNTs by the \n\nbrownish layer of BFO can be seen. In order to check the microscopic morphology the \n\nfilms fabricated at 400 \u00baC with varying time were investigated by SEM (Figure 7-11). \n\nSEM micrographs of BFO on VA-MWCNTs deposited at 400 oC for 1 and 2 h depict \n\nuniform coverage on the aligned tubes with rough topography. However, as the deposition \n\ntime increases (above 2 h) films become porous what may result from the partial or local \n\noxidation of MWCNTs, due to isothermal heating at ~400 oC for prolonged periods of \n\ntime. Indeed isothermal heating near 400 \u00baC in air results in the oxidation of MWCNTs \n\nas reported before (Chapter 4). \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n201 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n  \n\nFigure 7-10 Optical images of (a) dense VA-MWCNTs on Si substrate and (b) BFO \n\nsputtered on the surface of VA-MWCNTs, deposited at 400 \u00baC for 2 h.

The inset (marked by a circle in Figure 7-12 (b)) depicts VA-\n\nMWCNTs lattices with spacing of 0.34 nm and also intact carbon nanotubes; no visual \n\ndamage after deposition of BFO can be seen from HRTEM (Figure 7-12 (c) TEM \n\nmicrograph of as received VA-MWCNTs).

Under the current experimental settings the \n\nbest conditions for the fabrication of BFO by in-situ RF sputtering on VA-MWCNTs are \n\n400 \u00baC with deposition time varying between 1 and 2 h for which there is no damage of \n\nthe morphology of BFO films and MWCNTs.  \n\n   \n\nFigure 7-13 SEM elemental maps of MWCNTs coated with BFO at 400 \u00baC for 2 h (a): \n\nbismuth (b) and iron (c) showing a uniform distribution of elements. \n\nBFO films on VA-MWCNTs were further characterized by Raman spectroscopy \n\n(Figure 7-14 (a)). VA-MWCNTs used in this work depict two characteristic peaks at 1336 \n\nand 1575 cm-1 corresponding to D and G band respectively, where the D band is attributed \n\nto the breathing vibration of aromatic rings of carbon in the lattice, indicating that the \n\ndefect level of CNTs and G band corresponds to E2g mode where atoms of the carbon \n\nunit cell vibrate tangentially to each other [34]. After the BFO deposition the D and G \n\nband of MWCNTs shift to high frequency by ~2 cm-1 and the full width half maximum \n\nof the peaks also decreases due to less phonons interaction [29]. The shift in Raman peaks \n\ngives the information of the stress level of the MWCNTs [430]. In our case, because the \n\nobserved shift is small it indicates that the stress level developed at the interface is not so \n\nstrong, as the one observed for example for MWCNTs covered with PZT by pulse laser \n\ndeposition [28]. \n\nThe change in the intensity ratio of D and G bands (Id/Ig) is 1.0 and 1.2 for the \n\nMWCNTs and BFO coated VA-MWCNTs in this study, respectively. The increase in the \n\nintensity ratio after BFO deposition, may state that the BFO layer constrain the vibration \n\nmotion of carbon lattice and results in the increase of D band intensity; other possible \n\nreason for this shift can be related with the loss of structure, the conversion of significant \n\n(c) (b) (a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n204 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\nnumber of sp2 hybridized carbon to sp3 carbon hybridization during deposition of BFO \n\n[431]. From the Raman results one can also conclude that MWCNTs do not deteriorate \n\nsignificantly during the in-situ growth of BFO films at 400 oC corroborating the previous \n\nobservations. \n\nThe group theory predicts 13 Raman active modes 4A1 + 9E for rhombohedral \n\nlattice type with R3c space group, as is the case of BFO. Fukumura et al. [432] found all \n\nthe 13 Raman active mode for BFO cubic single crystals [111] at 4 K (A1 147, 176, 227, \n\n490 cm-1 and E 265, 279, 351, 375, 437, 473, 525, 77, 136 cm-1). In the present studies of \n\nBFO films on VA-MWCNTs, very weak Raman modes were observed at 121, 245, 458 \n\nand 612 cm-1, where 121, 245 and 458 cm-1 peaks are from A1 mode, 245 and 612 cm\n-1 \n\nare from E mode (Figure 7-14 (b)). The Raman modes observed for BFO on VA-\n\nMWCNTs shift towards lower frequency when compared with the Raman mode observed \n\nfor bulk BFO [433]. As well known in thin films soft modes are very sensitive to strain \n\nand nano structuring and generally it results in the shifting of Raman peaks; the shift \n\nupwards in the frequency results from compressive stresses while tensile stresses cause \n\ndownwards shifts [434]. Therefore, the shift of Raman peaks to lower frequency, as here \n\nobserved, indicates that BFO films on MWCNTs are in tensile state. \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n205 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\nFigure 7-14 Raman spectra of VA-MWCNTs and BFO on VA-MWCNTs (a); comparison \n\nof characteristic peaks of MWCNTs and BFO (b). The shift in Raman peaks states that \n\nthe CNTs and BFO on top of CNTs are under stress.  \n\nThe capacitance, losses and P-V loops were measured on BFO - MWCNTs \n\ncomposites and are depicted in Figure 7-15 (a, b). BFO-MWCNTs composites show \n\ncapacitance of 9 pF and dielectric losses ~0.02 at 1 MHz, for an applied voltage of 0.1 V. \n\nLossy P-V loops were observed with polarization values around 1.5 - 2 \u00b5C/cm2 at 50 and \n\n100 Hz, respectively. Indeed two main limitations of BFO (bulk, films and nanostructures \n\nin general) are the high dielectric losses and low resistivity. It is now well recognised that \n\nthe lossy polarization behaviour of BFO is mainly intrinsic and extrinsic, i.e. created by \n\nspace charge, defects, cationic and anionic vacancies, etc. The existence of oxygen \n\nvacancies has been related to the reduction of Fe3+ species to Fe2+ [Bi(Fe2+Fe3+)]O3-d and \n\nBi deficiency (Bi1\u2013xFeO3\u2013d) due to the high volatility of Bi [435-438]. In the present case \n\nthe synthesis of BFO carried out in reduced oxygen pressure might have contributed to \n\nthe oxygen vacancies [439] and in addition the CNTs and BFO interface and topography \n\nmight have contributed to conducting BFO. Because lossy hysteresis loops may hinder \n\nthe ferroelectric behaviour, therefore domain switching and local electrical polarization \n\nwere studied by PFM.  \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n206 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n  \n\nFigure 7-15 Hysterisis loop (a) and dielectric permitivity and looses as a function of \n\nfrequency (800 Hz to 1 MHz) (b) for BFO films on VA-MWCNTs sputtered at 400 oC for \n\n2 h. \n\nTopography and PFM phase response of BFO films (on top of VA-MWCNTs) \n\nwere simultaneously acquired with the application of 5 V at 30 kHz between the tip and \n\nthe ground electrode (MWCNTs) (Figure 7-16 (a, b)). The rms roughness of the BFO on \n\nVA-MWCNTs is 25 nm for 2 x 2 \u00b5m2 scan area; this is due to non-uniform surface of \n\nVA- MWCNTs. No well-defined grain boundaries can be seen from the topography \n\nmicrograph for BFO. Nevertheless, the line profile from topography image and \n\npiezoresponse depicts most of the response are consisting of mono domains (Figure 7-16 \n\n(c)). The piezoresponse image is characterized by strong domain contrast: deep bright and \n\ndark areas indicate significant out of plane components of polarization. There is a small \n\nfraction of regions with poor contrast likely corresponding to domains with polarization \n\ndirected parallel to the surface. The piezohistogram acquired from the piezoresponse \n\nmicrograph depicts the bi-modal distribution of the domains for BFO on VA-MWCNTs \n\n(Figure 7-16 (c)). The deconvolution of the piezohistogram into two peaks was done to \n\nemphasise the covered area with positive and negative domains. The out of plan phase \n\nresponse centre is 32o for the positive phase and ~- 42o for negative domains (Figure 7-16 \n\n(b)). From the fitting peaks and area under them it is clearly suggested that most of the \n\ndomains are oriented along the applied field. There is a very small area, which is not \n\ncovered by the two fitting peaks and is representing the number of domains, which do not \n\nshow out of plane response.  \n\n(b) (a) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n207 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7-16 Topography (a), out of plane piezoresponse (b) and line profile from \n\ntopography and piezoresponse (c) from BFO films on VA-MWCNTs.

The point poling was performed on two areas, where domains \n\nare showing the dark contrast (marked by cross in Figure 7-17 (a)). The marked area on \n\nthe left of the micrograph was poled by - 30 V and the marked area on the right of the \n\nmicrograph was poled by + 30 V each for approximately 30 s. After poling both the areas, \n\nthe piezoresponse was acquired with the application of 5 V depicted in Figure 7-17 (b) \n\n(poled area marked by cross). The piezoresponse from the area poled with -30 V, reveals \n\nno significant change in the contrast. However, the area poled with +30 V shows a change \n\nin the contrast of the area, which confirms the switching of domains with the application \n\nof DC bias. \n\n(a) \n\n(c) \n\n(b) \n\n(d) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n208 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\nThe above poling results indicate that BFO domains can be switched with the \n\napplication of an electric field. To further strengthen this claim of ferroelectric nature of \n\nthe BFO on the surface of VA-MWCNTs switching spectroscopy PFM (Switching \n\nspectroscopy, SS-PFM) with frequency of 0.2 Hz and period of individual pulses of 0.5 \n\nms, was carried out.

In PFM the measurements are local and come from \n\nindividual grains or adjacent grains, which reflects more or less single crystal properties. \n\nIt was proved that BFO films on VA-MWCNTs in spite of the low synthesis temperature \n\nand lossy macroscopic polarization response exhibit local ferroelectric behaviour where \n\nswitching of ferroelectric domains is possible under an applied field. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 7-17 Point poling was performed on the area marked by cross, with -30 V on left \n\nand +30 V on right: phase response (out of plane) before poling (a) and phase response \n\n(out of plane) after point poling for BFO films on VA-MWCNTs (b). \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n209 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7-18 Phase hysteresis loop (a) and amplitude loop (b) from BFO films on VA-\n\nMWCNTs acquired for 30 V. \n\nIn order to confirm the magnetic nature of these BFO films, the magnetization \n\nwas measured as the function of applied magnetic field (H) of -10000 Oe to 10000 Oe at \n\n300 K and given in  Figure 7-19. M-H hysteresis curves of BFO films on VA- MWCNTs \n\nat 400 oC for 2 h depict unsaturated hysteresis loops, indicating the R3c structure with \n\nantiferromagnetic nature, similar to the one observed for polycrystalline BFO bulk or \n\nsingle crystals [433]. However, a small coercivity (2Hc) of 700 Oe was observed for these \n\n(a) \n\n(b) \n\n\n\n \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n210 \n\nMultiwall carbon nanotubes \u2013 Bismuth ferrite oxide (BFO) \n\nBFO films (represented as inset of  Figure 7-19). The weak ferromagnetic behaviour was \n\nalso observed for nano particles and thin films of BFO as reported before [427, 440]. \n\nThere are two possible explanations for the weak ferromagnetism in BFO films and nano \n\nparticles: first, strain effects and oxygen vacancies associated with Fe+3 ions in BFO and \n\nsecond, size effects where below 62 nm size the uncompensated spins at the surface of \n\nthe particle arise [441-443]. Indeed it is clear from the TEM micrographs of BFO films \n\non VA-MWCNTs that the crystalline particles of BFO around the MWCNTs are smaller \n\nthan 10-20 nm and the small shift in the Raman peak of MWCNTs after BFO deposition \n\nalso indicates the existence of strains. Therefore, one can assumed that the weak \n\nferromagnetic behaviour of BFO on VA-MWCNTs may be due to the combined effect of \n\nstrain and size effects. Similar unsaturated weak ferroelectric loops were also reported for \n\nBFO nanotubes synthesised by chemical solution methods [414]. The shift in the \n\nhysteresis loops shown in inset of  Figure 7-19, can be ascribed to the presence of \n\nexchange coupling between the ferromagnetic surface and antiferromagnetic cores. The \n\nself-orientation of the magnetic domains during the synthesis can also be one of the \n\nreasons for the shift in the ferromagnetic loop from the origin. \n\n \n\n Figure 7-19 Magnetic hysteresis of BFO on VA-MWCNTs at 300 K.

It was learned that reducing atmosphere provided \n\nby the oxidation of CNTs plays a crucial role in the formation of pure BFO, namely \n\ncurbing the formation of the secondary phases. It was also found that the use of nitric acid \n\nsolvent with metal nitrates is a very interesting way to fill the VA-MWCNTs with \n\nfunctional oxides, in a single step. However, keeping CNTs intact during annealing \n\nprocess is challenging especially for bismuth compounds. The use of VA-MWCNTs work \n\nas template and BFO crystalline obtained mimic the morphology of VA-MWCNTs, \n\nwhich is very interesting. The use of VA-MWCNTs to synthesised 1D structures can be \n\nuseful in the development of materials with enhance magnetic properties.  \n\nBFO films on VA-MWCNTs were successfully deposited by RF sputtering \n\n(approach two) at 400 oC without damaging the morphology of both the tubes and films. \n\nSEM and HRTEM studies prove the conformal covering of MWCNTs with BFO. These \n\ncomposite structures (BFO on VA-MWCNTs) present a lossy macroscopic hysteretic \n\nresponse with low polarization values of 1-2 pC/cm2. In spite of that locally at the \n\nnanometric scale domains can be reversed from one direction to another under the applied \n\nfield. It is also clear from the M-H curve that BFO films on VA-MWCNTs are \n\nantiferromagnetic without any saturation. The small opening of the magnetization loop \n\nnear zero indicates the presence of a weak ferromagnetic nature of these BFO films which \n\nmight be due to size and/strain effects. The results here presented are a proof that BFO \n\nfilms on VA-MWCNTs can find potential applications in photovoltaics, memories and \n\nother microelectronic applications.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nGeneral conclusions and future work  \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n212 \n\nChapter 8 \n8 General conclusions and future work  \n\n\n\nGeneral conclusions and future work  \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n213 \n\nConclusions \n\n \n\nThe present work adds knowledge on the potential use of MWCNTs as bottom \n\nelectrodes for different microelectronic applications as 3D FERAMs and/or templates to \n\nobtain 1D FE nano structures. In this work we demonstrate and proved the concept of the \n\nuse of low cost, low temperature synthesis of chemical solution deposit ion (CSD) \n\nmethods for covering MWCNTs. Due to the close proximity of the oxidation temperature \n\nof MWCNTs and the phase formation of FE oxides and due the requirement of an \n\noxidizing atmosphere to get an oxide with proper ferroelectric response, this task is not \n\ntrivial. Therefore, vital parameters such as thermal oxidation of MWCNTs in different \n\natmospheres, FE oxide phase formation (in the presence of MWCNTs), interface \n\ndevelopment (FE and MWCNTs) and electrical properties of the prepared MWCNTs \u2013 \n\nFE nano structure have been experimentally investigated and based on these studies \n\nvarious mechanisms on the formation of MWCNTs - 1D structures were suggested. The \n\ncurrent work, in which three different ferroelectric oxides, PZT, BT and BFO were \n\nstudied, answers to many of the open questions and raises other challenges to be solved \n\nin the near future.  \n\nThe main conclusions of this work can be summarized as: \n\nThe thermal stability of MWCNTs depends on size, purity and type of CNTs. \n\nTherefore, the thermal properties of the MWCNTs used in this work were investigated \n\nby DTA/TG, Raman and TEM. It was found that MWCNTs are stable up to ~400 oC and \n\nstart degrading after the initial combustion of amorphous carbon. The oxidation or \n\nMWCNTs can be enhanced or delayed by changing the atmosphere conditions and/or \n\nheating rate. Oxygen atmosphere accelerates oxidation of MWCNTs that might occur at \n\ntemperatures as low as 200 oC and argon atmosphere decelerates the oxidation process \n\nshifting the combustion to temperatures as high as 800 \u00baC. Under a reducing atmosphere \n\nwith high heating rates MWCNTs are kept intact up to 1300 oC with negligible damage \n\nto CNTs morphology. These results are of the utmost importance for the in-situ \n\ncrystallization of FE with MWCNTs or for the heat treatment of MWCNT-FE structures. \n\n \n\n\n\nGeneral conclusions and future work  \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n214 \n\n The sol gel method was first investigated for covering the covalent functionalized \n\nMWCNTs with FE. A systematic study on the phase formation process by in-situ and ex-\n\nsitu XRD, DTA, FTIR and HRTEM was carried out. In these studies PZT was the chosen \n\nas the FE oxide. It was found that the perovksite PZT phase forms at 575 \u00baC for MWCNT-\n\nPZT whereas for PZT (without MWCNTs) traces of pyrochlore are still identifiable at \n\n650 \u00baC. The decrease of temperature is accompanied by a decrease in activation energy \n\nfor perovskite phase from 68\u00b115 kJ/mol (for PZT) to 27\u00b12 kJ/mol (for MWCNTs-PZT). \n\nfor holding time of 1 h monophasic perovskite phase in MWCNTs-PZT can be obtained \n\nat 500 \u00baC. HRTEM studies confirm in-situ and ex-situ XRD and DTA/TG results on the \n\nearly formation of perovskite PZT phase in presence of MWCNTs. We proposed that \n\nMWCNTs act as seeds to reduce the nucleation barrier of perovksite phase formation by \n\nproviding low energy nucleation sites; in addition the exothermic local oxidation of \n\nMWCNTs that might occur in some parts of the tubes result in the increase in the local \n\ntemperature that might promote the phase formation process. The piezoelectric nature of \n\nMWCNT/PZT synthesised at 500 \u00baC/1 h assessed by PFM proved the concept.  \n\nFor the case of the synthesis of MWCNTs with BT hydrothermal method was the \n\nselected one. In this case the challenge of compatibility with MWCNTs is even higher \n\nthan in the previous case due to the fact that BT requires a considerably high synthesis \n\ntemperature than PZT; and in addition, depending on the synthesis methodology, \n\ncarbonates are formed that are very difficult to eliminate, usually demanding even higher \n\npost annealing temperatures (> 1000 \u00baC) what jeopardises totally the combination with \n\nCNTs. Two different hydrothermal strategies were used to cover MWCNTs with BT. In \n\nthe first strategy the conventional method to synthesize BT at hydrothermal conditions \n\nwas used, where titanium dioxide particles on MWCNTs act as template site to react with \n\nbarium precursor to form BT on MWCNTs. By using this strategy we found that BT \n\nparticles did not adhere to the CNTs walls during the synthesis process. This process also \n\nresulted in the formation of reasonable amounts of BaCO3. This lead to the second \n\nstrategy. We used a sol gel hybrid hydrothermal method to cover MWCNTs with BT. In \n\nthis case the formation of BaCO3 was significantly reduced, due the limited access of Ba \n\nions (already entrapped between Ti amorphous networks) to the C skeleton. 100 nm \n\nstructures of MWCNTs \u2013 BT structures were fabricated, but unfortunately the coverage \n\nof the tubes was not totally complete. The selective (or semi) covering with BT of the \n\n\n\nGeneral conclusions and future work  \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n215 \n\nMWCNTs was suggested to be due to the covalent functionalization, which results in the \n\nformation of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups on the defect sites of CNTs. Therefore this \n\nfunctionalization is very local and not uniform through-out the tubes. Local electrical \n\nmeasurements by PFM proved the ferroelectric nature of the MWCNTs-BT structures \n\nwith an electromechanical behaviour of 15pm/V. From the above studies we proved that \n\nuse of sol gel hybrid hydrothermal method is a suitable methodology to cover uniformly \n\nCNTs at low temperature. \n\nTo maximise the coverage of MWCNTs with BT the non-covalent \n\nfunctionalization of MWCNTs was exploited, using in this case SDS. In non-covalent \n\nfunctionalization SDS molecules adsorbed uniformly on the surface of MWCNTs (in \n\ncontrast to the selective adsorption verified in covalent functionalization) and results in \n\nlarge functionalized area. SDSMWCNTs-BT structures were obtained by sol gel hybrid \n\nmethod. It was found that the initial concentration of the BT precursor has a significant \n\neffect on the morphology of the tubes. Conformally covered SDSMWCNTs with BT \n\nhaving diameters in the range from 20 to 200 nm were obtained from a 0.01 M BT solution \n\nand at 250 \u00baC. HRTEM confirms that non covalent functionalization, in this case with \n\nSDS, plays a crucial role on the covering of MWCNTs. The local PFM response These \n\nMWCNTs-BT tubes are ferroelectric with a d33 piezoelectric coefficient of 2 pm/V. \n\nMWCNTs were used as templates to fabricate 1D BFO nano structures. It was \n\nobserved by TEM that the use of nitric acid based solution of BFO results in the opening \n\nand filling of MWCNTs with BFO. However, during the crystallization process of BFO \n\nabove 350 \u00baC, the MWCNTs oxidize. The decrease in the oxidation temperature for the \n\nMWCNTs was a result of the severe damage caused in the MWCNTs during the \n\nprocessing step. Monophasic BFO was obtained at 420 \u00baC/2 h for MWCNTs-BFO, \n\nwhereas BFO (without CNTs) under the same heating conditions depicts the presence of \n\nsecondary phases (Bi2O3). The oxidation of MWCNTs decelerates the formation of \n\nsecondary phase due to the reducing of oxygen atmosphere. HRTEM of BFO crystallites \n\nobtained from MWCNTs-BFO shows BFO nano structures having the aspect ratio of 1:3 \n\nor above, and the diameter in the range of ~20-50 nm. Week ferromagnetic loops with \n\ncoercive field of 956 Oe at 5 K were measured in these BFO nano structures. \n\n \n\n\n\nGeneral conclusions and future work  \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n216 \n\nIn the last part of this work, we exploit the potential of using Vertically Aligned \n\n(VA) MWCNTs as a bottom conducting electrode to replace the expensive metal \n\nelectrodes. A successful coating of BFO on the surface of VA-MWCNTs was \n\ndemonstrated using RF sputtering. The optimum parameters for getting uniform BFO film \n\non the surface of VA-MWCNTs are 450 \u00baC for 2 h. HRTEM studies prove the conformal \n\ncovering of MWCNTs with BFO. The local properties measured by PFM clearly illustrate \n\nthe nanometric domains of BFO on VA-MWCNTs that can be reversed from one \n\ndirection to another under the external field. The M-H curves from BFO films on VA-\n\nMWCNTs show small opening of the magnetization loop near zero, indicating the \n\npresence of a weak ferromagnetic nature of these BFO films, which might be due to size \n\nand/strain effects.  \n\nFrom the above conclusions it is clear that MWCNTs can be uniformly covered \n\nwith FE oxides using low cost chemical solution method (presented in Table 8-1) and the \n\nobtained MWCNTs-FE depicts local ferroelectric properties. These results are of \n\nparticular relevance in 3D ferroelectric nano capacitors in which CNTs are proposed as \n\nbottom electrodes or template to fabricate 1D nano ferroelectric structures. These \n\ncomposites can be used for 3D FERAMs devices but also for photovoltaic, capacitors and \n\nother microelectronic applications.  \n\nFuture work \n\nAlthough the presented work responds to many of the current open questions it raises \n\nmany others, opening future avenues for further research. Here some of them: \n\nTo identify the exact role or MWCNTs in the early oxide phase formation in-situ \n\nHRTEM studies is required.  \n\nAfter the proof of the concept of MWCNTs-FE by low temperature and cost \n\nsynthesis a full detail electrical characterization is needed. Issues as reliability, fatigue, \n\nendurance are key points for future practical application of these 1D capacitors. Studies \n\non the electrical properties as a function of temperature, electric field and magnetic field \n\nare required. Since the ferroelectric performance has a direct relation with domain \n\nstructure, domain studies should be conducted. \n\n\n\nGeneral conclusions and future work  \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n217 \n\nStudies on the functionalization of the surface of the tubes as well as on the \n\noptimal conditions to fill MWCNTs with FE will add knowledge and will help to design \n\nmethods by which solution will only fill the tube without getting adsorbed on the outer \n\nwalls of MWCNTs. This will allow to construct patterns on and around the tubes adding \n\ncomplexity to the MWCNTs \u2013 FE structures. \n\nTable 8-1 Illustrate the summary of present work on the covering of MWCNTs with \n\nFerroelectric oxides. \n\nType of MWCNTs \n\nCoating \n\nFerroelectric (FE) \n\nMaterials \n\nMethod / Precursors \nRemarks on Covering \n\nMWCNTs with FE \n\nAcid functionalized \n\nMWCNTs \n\nPbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 \n\n(PZT) \n\nSol Gel / Lead acetate, \n\ntitanium tetra-isopropoxide \n\nand zirconium tetra-n-\n\npropoxide \n\nUniform coverage of \n\nMWCNTs by PZT \n\nAcid functionalized \n\nMWCNTs \nBaTiO3 (BT) \n\nHydrothermal / Barium \n\nacetate or Barium nitrate, \n\ntitanium isopropoxide \n\nNo covering, BT \n\nnucleate away from the \n\nsurface of MWCNTs \n\nAcid functionalized \n\nMWCNTs \nBaTiO3 (BT) \n\nSol gel Hydrothermal / \n\nBarium acetate and \n\ntitanium isopropoxide \n\nLocalized covering of \n\nMWCNTs with BT \n\nSDS functionalized \n\nMWCNTs \nBaTiO3 (BT) \n\nSol gel Hydrothermal / \n\nBarium acetate and \n\ntitanium isopropoxide \n\nConformal covering of \n\nMWCNTs with BT \n\nAcid functionalized \n\nMWCNTs \nBiFeO3 (BFO) \n\nSol gel / Bismuth nitrate \n\nand iron nitrate \n\nMWCNTs act as \n\ntemplates to form BFO \n\n1D rods \n\nVertical Aligned -\n\nMWCNTs \nBiFeO3 (BFO) \n\nRF sputtering / Bismuth \n\noxide and iron oxide \n\nConformal forming of \nBFO thin layer on \n\nsurface of VA-\n\nMWCNTs \n\n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\nFerroelectric \u2013 Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) structures fabrication for advanced functional nano devices         \n218 \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n1.
