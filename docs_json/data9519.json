Rarely do we find some discussions about phosphorus \n\nproblematic. Through the years the phosphorus as been a real problem and must be more \n\ndiscussed. \n\nOn this thesis was done a global material flow analysis of phosphorus, based on data from the \n\nyear 2004, the production of phosphate rock in that year was 18.9 million tones, almost this \n\namount it was used as fertilizer on the soil and the plants only can uptake, on average, 20% of \n\nthe input of fertilizer to grow up, the remainder is lost for the phosphorus soil. In the \n\nphosphorus soil there is equilibrium between the phosphorus available to uptake from the \n\nplants and the phosphorus associate with other compounds, this equilibrium depends of the \n\nkind of soil and is related with the soil pH.  \n\nA reserve inventory was done and we have 15,000 million tones as reserve, the amount that is \n\neconomical available. The reserve base is estimated in 47,000 million tones. The major \n\nreserves can be found in Morocco and Western Sahara, United Sates, China and South Africa. \n\nThe reserve estimated in 2009 was 15,000 million tone of phosphate rock or 1,963 million tone \n\nof P. If every year the mined phosphate rock is around 22 Mt/yr (phosphorus production on \n\n2008 USGS 2009), and each year the consumption of phosphorus increases because of the \n\nfood demand, the reserves of phosphate rock will be finished in about 90 years, or maybe even \n\nless. \n\nAbout the value/impact assessment was done a qualitative analysis, if on the future we don\u2019t \n\nhave more phosphate rock to produce fertilizers, it is expected a drop on the crops yields, each \n\ndepends of the kind of the soil and the impact on the humans feed and animal production will \n\nnot be a relevant problem. \n\nWe can recovery phosphorus from different waste streams such as ploughing crop residues \n\nback into the soil, Food processing plants and food retailers, Human and animal excreta, Meat \n\nand bone meal, Manure fibre, Sewage sludge and wastewater.  Some of these examples are \n\ndeveloped in the paper. \n\n   \n\n\n\nResumo \n\n \n\nNestes \u00faltimos anos as quest\u00f5es ambientais s\u00e3o cada vez mais estudadas, diariamente fala-se \n\nem problemas tais como o aquecimento global, emiss\u00e3o de gases poluentes, polui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00e1guas. Por outro lado, a deple\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos naturais tem menos impacto na comunica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsocial. \n\nA quantidade de f\u00f3sforo existente no nosso planeta versos a sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o constitui hoje em \n\ndia um grande problema ambiental. As reservas de f\u00f3sforo existentes s\u00e3o finitas tais como a \n\ndo petr\u00f3leo, e a extrac\u00e7\u00e3o do f\u00f3sforo tem sido crescente de acordo com as necessidades \n\nmundiais.  \n\nO f\u00f3sforo \u00e9 um componente essencial para o crescimento das plantas e grande parte do \n\nf\u00f3sforo produzido \u00e9 utilizado na agricultura como fertilizante. No entanto o ciclo natural do \n\nf\u00f3sforo \u00e9 muito lento podendo levar um milh\u00e3o de anos para formar e existir f\u00f3sforo sob a \n\nforma dispon\u00edvel para extrac\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nPor esta raz\u00e3o, na presente tese a An\u00e1lise de Fluxo Material (MFA) feita s\u00f3 \u00e9 considerado no \n\nciclo do f\u00f3sforo a quantidade anual extra\u00edda, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o dos diversos produtos contendo \n\nf\u00f3sforo, e os principais fluxos de uso do f\u00f3sforo.  \n\nO grande objectivo da elabora\u00e7\u00e3o do MFA foi ter uma no\u00e7\u00e3o da ordem de grandeza de f\u00f3sforo \n\nperdido no ambiente, para posteriormente estudar os impactos ao n\u00edvel do crescimento das \n\nplantas bem como nos humanos e animais. O MFA realizado permite concluir que no ano de \n\n2009 a reserva de f\u00f3sforo em rocha com potencial para ser extra\u00edda foi estimada em 15.000 \n\nMt de f\u00f3sforo, e a produ\u00e7\u00e3o deste elemento foi de 1.963 Mt, o que significa que as reservas de \n\nf\u00f3sforo terminar\u00e3o em 90 anos, ou talvez menos. \n\nNesta tese foram avaliadas hip\u00f3teses para os poss\u00edveis impactos no caso de n\u00e3o haver f\u00f3sforo \n\npara fertilizar os solos, caso as reservas de f\u00f3sforo terminem dentro deste s\u00e9culo, como \n\nprevisto por dados estat\u00edsticos das reservas existentes e da sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o anual.  \n\nFoi avaliado o impacto causado no crescimento das plantas, se houver um d\u00e9fice de f\u00f3sforo na \n\nterra onde a planta est\u00e1 a desenvolver-se, os dados de diferentes testes comprovam que \n\ninfluenciar\u00e1 o crescimento das plantas, principalmente o crescimento das ra\u00edzes. No entanto \n\nnuma entrevista com um especialista nesta \u00e1rea, este \u00e9 da opini\u00e3o que a planta ir\u00e1 adaptar-se \n\n\n\ndesenvolvendo as ra\u00edzes de modo a procurar f\u00f3sforo noutros n\u00edveis da terra, portanto n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 \n\ngrande impacto. \n\nEstudou-se tamb\u00e9m o impacto na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de agr\u00edcola e em discuss\u00e3o com diferentes \n\nespecialistas agr\u00f3nomos, de um modo gen\u00e9rico, ao longo do tempo a produ\u00e7\u00e3o ir\u00e1 decair, pois \n\nexiste ainda uma quantidade de f\u00f3sforo dispon\u00edvel no solo (disponibilidade depende \n\npredominantemente do pH), quando terminar o f\u00f3sforo dispon\u00edvel no solo a disponibilidade \n\nir\u00e1 depender da capacidade de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o da planta em desenvolver ra\u00edzes de modo a procurar \n\nf\u00f3sforo noutras camadas da terra. \n\nInicialmente na equipa de estudo onde estava inserida, sup\u00f4s-se que se h\u00e1 menos f\u00f3sforo \n\ndispon\u00edvel para a planta nos solos, logo a planta tamb\u00e9m teria menos f\u00f3sforo. As plantas \n\ncontendo menos f\u00f3sforo iriam causar um impacto na alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o dos humanos e animais. \n\nMas, diferentes agr\u00f3nomos s\u00e3o da opini\u00e3o que a quantidade de f\u00f3sforo ir\u00e1 manter-se igual nas \n\ne mesmo que houvesse um decr\u00e9scimo os humanos consomem mais f\u00f3sforo do que realmente \n\nnecessitam diariamente.  \n\nPortanto \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio procurar solu\u00e7\u00f5es pois o maior impacto ser\u00e1 na produ\u00e7\u00e3o agr\u00edcola, o que \n\nprovavelmente ir\u00e1 gerar tamb\u00e9m conflitos socioecon\u00f3micos.  \n\nCom vista a minimizar os consumos de f\u00f3sforo, recuperar f\u00f3sforo em fluxos que s\u00e3o perdidos \n\npara a natureza, j\u00e1 existem em diferentes partes no mundo m\u00e9todos de \n\nreciclagem/recupera\u00e7\u00e3o. A Su\u00e9cia \u00e9 um bom exemplo, pois tem sanitas pr\u00f3prias para separar a \n\nurina das fezes, de modo a recuperar a urina e utiliz\u00e1-la directamente como fertilizante, visto a \n\nurina conter uma elevada percentagem em f\u00f3sforo. Outro caso de sucesso, \u00e9 uma empresa \n\nque desenvolveu um fungo que \u00e9 capaz de transformar o f\u00f3sforo que esteja n\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel \n\npara a planta no solo numa forma dispon\u00edvel para absor\u00e7\u00e3o da planta. \n\n\u00c9 obvio que a deple\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos do f\u00f3sforo \u00e9 um problema a n\u00edvel ambiental, mas ainda h\u00e1 \n\nv\u00e1rios estudos que podem vir a ser feitos e tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 essencial a divulga\u00e7\u00e3o desta \n\nproblem\u00e1tica \u00e0 sociedade, para uma tomada de consci\u00eancia colectiva. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nList of Contents \n\nAbbreviations ........................................................................................ .................................... 1 \n\n1.

Introduction to Phosphorus Problematic \n\n2.1. Phosphate rock and its characteristics \n \n\nPhosphorus is the eleventh most abundant element in the lithosphere. Owing to its relative \n\nreactivity, it is generally associated with calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), fluorine (F), chloride (Cl), \n\nmetals such as iron (Fe), aluminium (Al), magnesium (Mg), heavy metals, for example cadmium \n\n(Cd), radionucleids like uranium (U) etc. In reality almost every element that can be found in \n\nthe periodic table is represented in phosphate rock. \n\nThere are two main types of phosphate rock deposits, igneous and sedimentary, which have \n\nwidely differing mineralogical, textural and chemical characteristics. \n\nThe most prevalent phosphate minerals in these rocks are species of apatite, i.e. calcium \n\nphosphate with quartz, calcite, dolomite, clay and iron oxide as gangue components. Igneous \n\nrock is often associated with carbonatites and/or alkalic intrusions and is generally low in \n\ngrade i.e. low concentration of phosphate. The abundance ratio of igneous versus sedimentary \n\nrock is 13 to 87. Some 80% of the world phosphate production is derived from sedimentary \n\nphosphate deposits. \n\nMore than 75% of the globally commercially exploited phosphate rock is surface mined, which \n\ncan take many forms from manual methods to the employment of highly mechanized \n\ntechnologies, with the remainder recovered by underground mining. \n\nPhosphate content in currently mined rocks can range from over 40% to below 5%. The mined \n\nrock is further processed to remove the bulk of the contained impurities and thus upgrade the \n\nrock. Consequently, the rock concentrate contains an increased apatite content of an \n\nimproved quality. The beneficiation process usually allows a concentration of around 1.5x but \n\nhigher ratios up to 9x are possible with some rocks. After beneficiation, phosphate rock \n\n(concentrate) generally ranges from 26% to about 34% P2O5 and up to as much as 42%. \n\nPhosphate rock can be beneficiated by many methods, and usually a combination of methods \n\nis used. In general, with the lower concentration of phosphate and lower quality deposit, the \n\nmore waste is generated. Furthermore, more energy and chemicals are required per ton of \n\nuseful phosphate produced. Consequently, the cost for recovery and beneficiation of \n\nphosphate rock increases significantly in relation to lower grade and lower quality deposit. An \n\nanalysis of production costs must thus be an integral part in the assessment of the lifetime of \n\nphosphate deposits and the likely cost of fertilizers in the future. \n\nMost phosphate rock is further processed, but very small volumes are applied directly to acidic \n\nsoils as fertilizer (NHM, 1998).  \n\n \n\n\n\n 4 \n  \n\n2.2. Importance of Phosphorous  \n \n\nWhile access to water and energy sources are now understood to be limiting factors to \n\nachieving global food security, the implications of future phosphate scarcity has not received \n\nexplicit mention in key dialogues on global food security. Fig. 1 depicts four of the key current \n\ndiscourses on global food security, illustrating that phosphorus is missing from the picture and \n\ncould be added (Cordell, 2008).  \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Dominant discourses on global food security: including accessibility to food, health, \n\nenergy and water (Cordell, 2008). \n\n \n\nPhosphorus in the context of food production and the environment is most commonly framed \n\nas an environmental pollutant, which together with nitrogen, contributes to eutrophication \n\nand algal blooms worldwide. However, phosphorus is simultaneously a critical nutrient input in \n\nagriculture whose global reserves are being rapidly depleted. Rarely are phosphorus pollution \n\nand phosphate scarcity discussed in the same context. \n\nThe risks of not considering systemic links are exemplified by the recent increased global \n\nconcern about oil scarcity and climate change leading to a rapid production boom of biofuel \n\ncrops which not only compete with food production for prime fertile land, yet require profuse \n\n\n\n 5 \n  \n\namounts of phosphorus fertilizers. This sudden increased demand for fertilizers worldwide has \n\ncontributed to the seven-fold increase in the price of phosphate rock. In this sense, the peak \n\noil problem is being shifted to a peak phosphorus problem, making the \u2018supra\u2019-system \n\nunsustainable in the long-term (Cordell, 2008) \n\n \n\n2.3. The utilization of phosphorus \n \n\nCrop production relied on natural levels of soil phosphorus and the addition of locally available \n\norganic matter like manure and human excreta (Maarald, 1998). To keep up with increased \n\nfood demand due to rapid population growth in the 20\nth\n\n century, guano and later rock \n\nphosphate were applied extensively to food crops (Brink, 1977; Smil, 2000b). Fig. 2 gives a \n\nbroad outline of the evolution of phosphorus fertilizer use for food production.  \n\nA long time ago, the Chinese civilization used human excreta as fertilizer, like the Japanese \n\ncivilization did (Matsui, 1997). \n\nIn Europe, soil degradation and recurring famines during the 17th and 18th centuries created \n\nthe need to supplement animal and human excreta with other sources of phosphorus \n\n(Maarald, 1998). In the early 19th century, for instance, England imported large quantities of \n\nbones from other European countries. In addition to the application of phosphorus from new \n\nsources, improved agricultural techniques enabled European agriculture to recover from the \n\nfamines of the 18th century (Maarald, 1998). These improvements included crop rotation, \n\nimproved handling of manure, and in particular, and the introduction of new crops such as \n\nclover which could fix nitrogen from the atmosphere.  \n\n \nFigure 2 - Historical sources of phosphorus fertilizers since 1800 until 2000, based in \n\ncalculation from Brink (1997), Buckingham and Jasinski (2004), IFA (2006) and Smil (2000b), \n\n(Cordell et al. 2009). \n\n \n\n\n\n 6 \n  \n\nIn 1840 Liebig formulated the \u2018mineral theory\u2019, which replaced the \u2018humus theory\u2019 that plants \n\nand animals were given life in a mysterious way from dead or decomposing plants and animals \n\n(Liebig, 1840; Maarald, 1998). Liebig provided a scientific explanation: nutrients such as \n\nnitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were elements circulating between dead and living \n\nmaterial (Maarald, 1998). This discovery occurred during a period of rapid urbanization in \n\nEurope, when fertilizer factories were being established around growing cities. Food \n\nproduction was local and the factories manufactured phosphorus fertilizers from locally \n\navailable organic waste products, such as human excreta, industrial organic waste by-products, \n\nanimal dung, fish, ash, bones, and other slaughterhouse by-products (Maarald, 1998; Neset et \n\nal., 2008). However, around the mid-to-late 19th century, the use of local organic matter was \n\nreplaced by phosphorus material from distant sources. The mining of guano (bird droppings \n\ndeposited over previous millennia) and phosphate-rich rock had begun (Brink, 1977; Smil, \n\n2000b). World trade in guano grew rapidly, but it relied on a limited resource which declined \n\nby the end of the 19th century (Stewart et al., 2005). Phosphate rock was seen as an unlimited \n\nsource of concentrated phosphorus and the market for mineral fertilizers developed rapidly. At \n\nthe same time, the introduction of flush toilets in towns meant that human waste was \n\ndischarged into water bodies instead of being returned to the soil. There were protests among \n\nintellectuals that farmers were being robbed of human manure. \n\n \n\nTrade in food grew steadily with urbanization and colonization, but insufficient amounts of \n\nnutrients were returned to the areas of food production to balance off-takes. By the late 19th \n\ncentury, processed mineral phosphorus fertilizer was routinely used in Europe and its use grew \n\nsubstantially in the 20th. Processed mineral fertilizers such as ordinary superphosphate (OSP) \n\ntypically contained an order of magnitude greater concentration of phosphorus than did \n\nmanure (Smil, 2000b). Application of such highly concentrated fertilizers helped rectify the \n\nphosphorus deficiency of soils. In the mid-20th century the Green Revolution improved \n\nagricultural output in many countries. As well as introducing new crop varieties, the Green \n\nRevolution involved the application of chemical fertilizers. This new approach saved millions \n\nfrom starvation and the proportion of the world\u2019s population that was undernourished \n\ndeclined despite rapid population growth (IFPRI, 2002; Cordell et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nNowadays, the use of fertilizers for phosphorus, nitrogen and potassium is indispensable to \n\nthe increase in food demand. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 7 \n  \n\n2.4. Phosphate rock reserves  \n \n\nBefore the phosphate rock reserve finishes, a global peak in phosphates reserves can be \n\npredicted, and it is estimated to occur on the next 30 years. \n\nHubbert in 1949 predicted (Hubbert, 1949) that the production of oil resources will eventually \n\nreach a maximum rate or \u2018peak\u2019 based on the finite nature of non-renewable resources, after \n\nwhich production will decline. Hubbert and later others contest that the important period is \n\nnot when 100% of the resource is depleted, but rather when it reaches a maximum \n\nproduction, which occurs when 50% of the resource is still in the ground. After this point, \n\nproduction will decreases, placing upward pressure on prices and increasing international \n\ntensions (Campbell, 1997).  \n\nThis analysis of peak phosphorus is based on estimated P in current world phosphate rock \n\nreserves (approximately 2358 Mt P ) based on US Geological Survey data and cumulative \n\nproduction between 1900-2007 (totaling 854 Mt P) based on US Geological Survey data \n\n(Buckingham and Jasinski, 2006; Jasinski, 2007, 2008) and European Fertilizer Manufacturers \n\nAssociation (2000). The area under the Hubbert curve must equal the depleted plus current \n\nreserves, totaling approximately 3,212 Mt P. Units of phosphorus are presented as elemental \n\nP, rather than P2O5 (containing 44% P) or phosphate rock (containing 29-34% P2O5) as \n\ncommonly used by industry (Stuart et al., 2006).  \n\nThe data for production is fitted using a Gaussian distribution (Laherrere, 2000), based on the \n\ndepleted plus current reserves estimate of 3,212 Mt P, and a least squares optimization which \n\nresults in a production at peak of 28 Mt P/a and a peak year of 2034 (Fig. 3) (Stuart et al., \n\n2006). \n\n \n\n\n\n 8 \n  \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Peak phosphorus \u2018Hubbert\u2019 curve, indicating that production will eventually reach a \n\nmaximum, after which it will decline (Stuart et al., 2006). \n\nWhile it is understood that phosphate rock, like oil and other key non-renewable resources will \n\nfollow a Hubbert production curve, a key difference between peak oil and peak phosphorus, is \n\nthat oil can be replaced with other forms of energy once it becomes too scarce. However there \n\nis no substitute for P in food production (Cordell, et al, 2009). P cannot be produced or \n\nsynthesized in a laboratory. Quite simply, without phosphorus, we cannot produce food \n\n(Stuart et al., 2006).  \n\nAlthough oil is unavailable once it is used, while phosphorus is an element that can be \n\ncaptured after use and recirculated for use within economic and technical limits. Peak \n\nphosphorus is also linked to peak oil. For example, the recent oil price shock and growing \n\nconcern about climate change has stimulated a dramatic increase in biofuel crop production \n\nglobally, which in turn increases the demand for phosphate fertilizers, and hence the proximity \n\nof the phosphorus peak (Stuart et al., 2006; Cordell et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 9 \n  \n\n3. Global Material Flow Analysis (MFA) of Phosphorus \n\n3.1. What a is MFA  \n \n\nMaterial flow analysis is a method to describe, investigate, and evaluate the metabolism of \n\nanthropogenic and geogenic systems. MFA defines terms and procedures to establish material \n\nbalances of systems (Brunner, 2003). It is an accounting system that captures the mass \n\nbalances in an economy, where inputs (extractions + imports) equal outputs (consumptions + \n\nexports + accumulation + wastes), and thus is based on the laws of Thermodynamics.  \n\n Material Flow Analysis recognizes that material through put is required for all economic \n\nactivities and hypotheses whether the flow of materials is sustainable in terms of the \n\nenvironmental burden it creates. It accounts for all materials and energy used in production \n\nand consumption, including the hidden flows, or ecological rucksack, of materials that were \n\nextracted in the production cycle but which never entered the final products.  The physical size \n\nof these hidden flows is often many times larger than the flows that end up in actual products.  \n\nThe identification of wastes is a major issue in MFA, as the purpose of conducting a MFA is to \n\nminimize the flow of materials while maximizing the human welfare generated by the flow. Its \n\nmethodology allows the monitoring of wastes that are typically unaccounted for in traditional \n\neconomic analyses. As such, it is a method for evaluating the efficiency of using material \n\nresources. \n\n MFA was develop in Europe, largely at the Wuppertal Institute in Germany, and has been \n\nadopted as a methodology by the European Union with respect to its sustainable development \n\nprogram.  To date the focus of MFA has been primarily regional or national; a variety of MFA \n\nstudies have been conducted for both developed countries and economies in transition, \n\nincluding Germany, the UK,  Japan, Brazil, Venezuela, Chile and China. EU wide studies have \n\nalso been conducted, and a global MFA is now underway (The Sustainable scale Project 2003).  \n\n   \n\n3.2. MFA and Relation to Sustainable Scale \n \n\nMFA is a method for operationalizing the concept of material throughput, and as such is an \n\nimportant contribution to measuring one component of sustainable scale. MFA has proven \n\nvery useful for demonstrating the negative impacts associated with various specific economic \n\nactivities. It has highlighted in a very practical way the unsustainability of specific throughputs \n\n(e.g. high reliance on non-renewable resources), the incompatibility of absolute levels of input \n\nwith an equal Earthshare identified within the Ecological Footprint , the displacement of \n\necological burden to trading partners (generally from developed to undeveloped nations), and \n\nthe enormous wastes involved in specific products or services.  \n\nContinued development of this important tool will likely increase its usefulness in linking \n\neconomic throughput with ecological limits, especially as it is applied to the global level \n\n(Brunner, 2003).  \n\n\n\n 10 \n  \n\n  \n\n3.3. MFA Procedures \n \n\nMFA consists of several steps, in general begins with the definition of the problem and the \n\nadequate goals. Then relevant substances and appropriate system boundaries, processes, and \n\ngoals are selected. Next, mass flows of goods and substance concentrations in these flows are \n\nassessed. The final step is to present the results in an appropriate way, in this case as a flow \n\nchart (Brunner, 2003).  \n\n3.3.1. Selection of Substance \n \n\nThere are various approaches to choosing substances relevant for an MFA. By one hand, they \n\ndepend on the purpose of the MFA, and on the other hand, they depend on the kind of system \n\non which the MFA is based (Brunner, 2003).  \n\nIn this case study the substance is phosphorous. The phosphorus can be found on the nature in \n\ndifferent forms, as we can see on the phosphorous cycle (Fig. 4). \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Nature Phosphorous cycle (vincejtremante.tripod.com).  \n\n\n\n 11 \n  \n\nIn the nature phosphorus is found in different forms. In the atmosphere P is present on \n\nparticulates over land and over oceans; in land P is found on biota, soil, mineable rock, fresh-\n\nwater (dissolved); finally in the ocean P is present on biota, dissolved (inorganic), detritus \n\n(particulates) and sediments. \n\n \n\n3.3.1.1. Soil Chemistry  \n \n\nWhen the phosphate in fertilizers and manure is used on the soil, the phosphate is initially \n\nquite soluble and available. Manure contains soluble phosphate, organic phosphate, and \n\ninorganic phosphate compounds that are quite available. When the fertilizer or manure \n\nphosphate comes in contact with the soil, various reactions begin occurring that make the \n\nphosphate less soluble and less available (Fig. 5). The rates and products of these reactions are \n\ndependent on such soil conditions as pH, moisture content, temperature, and the minerals \n\nalready present in the soil. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Scheme showing the interactions on the Phosphorus in soil. \n\nAs a particle of fertilizer comes in contact with the soil, moisture from the soil will begin \n\ndissolving the particle. Dissolving of the fertilizer increases the soluble phosphate in the soil \n\nsolution around the particle and allows the dissolved phosphate to move a short distance away \n\nfrom the fertilizer particle. Movement is slow but may be increased by rainfall or irrigation \n\nwater flowing through the soil. As phosphate ions in solution slowly migrate away from the \n\nfertilizer particle, most of the phosphate will react with the minerals within the soil. Phosphate \n\nions generally react by adsorbing to soil particles or by combining with elements in the soil \n\nsuch as calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), and iron (Fe), and forming compounds \n\nthat are solids. The adsorbed phosphate and the newly formed solids are relatively available to \n\nmeet crop needs. \n\nSoil P\n\nHPO4\n-2;H2PO\n\n4-\n\nOrganic P\n\n(Microbial;Plant\nresidue;Humus)\n\nMineral Surfaces\n(clays, Fe and Al\noxides;carbonates)\n\nSecundary\nCompounds\n\n(CaP;FeP;MnP;AlP)\n\nLeaching\n\n\n\n 12 \n  \n\nGradually reactions occur in which the adsorbed phosphate and the easily dissolved \n\ncompounds of phosphate form more insoluble compounds that cause the phosphate to be \n\nbecome fixed and unavailable. Over time this results in a decrease in soil test P. The \n\nmechanisms for the changes in phosphate are complex and involve a variety of compounds. In \n\nalkaline soils Ca is the dominant cation (positive ion) that will react with phosphate. A general \n\nsequence of reactions in alkaline soils is the formation of dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate, \n\noctocalcium phosphate, and hydroxyapatite. The formation of each product results in a \n\ndecrease in solubility and availability of phosphate. In acidic soils (especially with soil pH less \n\nthan 5.5) Al is the dominant ion that will react with phosphate. In these soils the first products \n\nformed would be amorphous Al and Fe phosphates, as well as some Ca phosphates. The \n\namorphous Al and Fe phosphates gradually change into compounds that resemble crystalline \n\nvariscite (an Al phosphate) and strengite (an Fe phosphate). Each of these reactions will result \n\nin very insoluble compounds of phosphate that are generally not available to plants. Reactions \n\nthat reduce P availability occur in all ranges of soil pH but can be very pronounced in alkaline \n\nsoils (pH > 7.3) and in acidic soils (pH &lt;5.5). Maintaining soil pH between 6 and 7 will generally \n\nresult in the most efficient use of phosphate, as it is shown on Fig. 6 (Busman, 2008).  \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Correlation between the phosphorus available with soil pH (Busman, 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n3.3.2. System definition in space and time \n \n\nThe spatial system boundary is usually determined by the scope of the Project, so the \n\nboundary here is global including all streams with phosphorous in world. \n\n \n\n Temporal system boundaries are comparatively easier to determine. This is especially the case \n\nwhen average flows and stocks over a longer period of time are of interest. In this case, the \n\ntime span of investigation, which is identical with the temporal system boundary, has to be \n\nextended long enough to outweigh the momentary unsteadiness of the system. Usually in this \n\ncase of analysis the temporal system boundary is one year (Brunner 2003). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 13 \n  \n\n \n\n3.3.3. Identification of Relevant Flows and Process  \n \n\nAfter selecting the substance and defining system boundary, a first rough balance of goods is \ncarried out for the system.

The flow chart \n\nhighlights more the human influence instead of influence from the nature. \n\n4. Practical Part \n \n\nA MFA was done in flow chart presentation taking data from recently MFA from Liu et al. and \n\n(2008), Cordell et al. (2009). The year of all data for MFA is 2004. \n\nIn order to understand better the relations between the P on the soil and the P available on \n\nthe soils, and also to understand the consequences/impact on the crops, humans feed and \n\nanimal production, a questionnaire was prepared to present to two agricultural specialists, \n\nGitte Rub\u00e6k from University of Aarhus and Jan Schjorring from The University of Copenhagen.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 15 \n  \n\n5. Results and Discussion \nThe phosphate rock is a nature reserve, so it is considered as a pool, as the P pool on the soil, \n\nthis flow chart as the propose to show the relation in use the phosphorus reserve and the \n\nconsequences on the nature focus on the consequences on the soil. The nature is not so \n\nrelevant and this study because the natural phosphorus flow occurs very slowly, one single \n\nloop of the nature cycle can take over 1 million years (Liu et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n5.1. MFA Flow chart \n \n\nThe flow chart (Fig. 7) begins with the transformation of phosphate rock in phosphate ore by \n\nmining. Phosphate ore is extracted with an average P content of 13% by surface or strip mining \n\nand contains calcium, iron, aluminum, magnesium, silica, sodium, potassium, fluorine, and \n\nmany others impurities (Lauriente, 2003).  \n\n\n\n 16 \n  \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Global Phosphorus Material Flow Analysis, all values are in Mt of P/yr and from the year 2004.  \n\n\n\n 17 \n  \n\n \n\n5.2. Phosphorus flows in production of phosphoric acid \n \n\nThe production of phosphate rock in 2004 was 143 Mt (USGS, 2009), so we have an input of \n\n18.9 Mt of P in the system. Most of the phosphorus produced is used on the world soils as a \n\nfertilizer, on the MFA flow chart we can see that 17.66 go to the soil. Recently, Cordell \n\nestimated that 8 Mt of P per year is lost by erosion on the soils.  \n\nThe most common way to produce phosphoric acid is the wet phosphoric acid production and \n\nthe thermal phosphoric production. Phosphoric acid is the precursor of many of intermediate \n\nand end uses of phosphate compounds. \n\n5.2.1. Wet Phosphoric Acid \nWet phosphoric acid is usually produced in large complexes often near the phosphate rock \n\ndeposits. A large part of the acid is used near the sites of rock production to produce \n\nnongranular and granular triple superphosphates and granular ammonium phosphates. \n\nHowever, substantial amounts of wet phosphoric acid are shipped to local and distant plants. \n\nThe phosphate ore is digested as slurry with sulfuric acid in multiple reactions tanks or in a \n\ncompartmented single tank. Slurry from the reaction system is filtered to remove the calcium \n\nsulfate that precipitates in the reaction. Conditions during the reactions are controlled to \n\nobtain crystals of calcium sulfate that filter at a high rate. The dehydrate wet phosphoric acid \n\nprocess results in the precipitation of byproduct calcium sulfate as the dehydrate form. Other \n\nwet phosphoric acid processes are operating at higher temperatures resulting in the \n\nprecipitation of calcium sulfate in the hemihydrates or the anhydrite form. The filter cake is \n\nwashed to recover about 95% of phosphoric acid at a concentration usually ranging from 28% \n\nto 30% P2O5 for the dehydrate process or 40%-50% for the hemihydrates process. \n\nThe filter-grade acid is concentrated by vacuum evaporation to 52%-54% P2O5 (merchant \n\ngrade) for shipping and for use in production phosphate fertilizers. For ammonium phosphate \n\nproduction at the site, a concentration of about 40% -45% is sufficient. Wet phosphoric acid, \n\nused mainly in preparation of liquid fertilizers, is prepared by concentration to 68%-70% P2O5 \n\ncontent (Kauwenbergh, 2007).  \n\n \n\nThe world consumption of wet phosphoric acid was 14.3 Mt of P for 2004. It is a precursor for \n\nfertilizers and for industrial phosphates (Villalha et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 18 \n  \n\nWet acid is used to produce the following fertilizers: \n\n\u2022 Ammonium phosphates (a world figure of 6.870 Mt of P for 2004; IFA 2006) - normally \n\nreferred to as APP, it is the most widely consumed fertilizer; \n\n\u2022 Nitric phosphates and other nitrogen containing phosphate fertilizers (4.160 Mt of P IFA \n\n2006); \n\n\u2022 Single phosphates (a world figure of 2.749 Mt of P for 2004; IFA 2006); \n\n\u2022 Triple phosphates (a world figure of 933 thousand metric tons of P for 2004; IFA 2006;Villalha \n\net al., 2008). \n\n5.2.2. Thermal Phosphoric Acid Production \n \n\nThe thermal process first requires the production of elemental phosphorus. In this production, \n\ncarbon monoxide and phosphorus are produced as gases, together with SiF4. The phosphorus \n\n(product) is condensed, the carbon monoxide is used as fuel or burned as waste, and the SiF4 is \n\neither lost through emissions (older plants) or collected (newer plants). In the production of \n\nthermal acid from elemental phosphorus, the major emission is phosphoric acid mist. The mist \n\nis mostly recovered, depending on the plant, but some is lost to the air (Villalha et al., 2008).  \n\nThermal acid is of a higher grade than wet acid and is thus used in the food industry and in \n\nindustrial phosphates, whereas wet acid mostly goes to fertilizer production. Wet acid can be \n\nfurther purified by extraction and used in combination with thermal acid (Villalha et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nWet acid is also purified through extraction (0.44 Mt P/year estimated for 2004) and used in \n\nthe production of industrial phosphates (technical and food applications), this amount is used \n\nin the production of thermal phosphoric acid.  \n\nWet phosphoric acid has a few end uses of its own (0.13 Mt P/year estimated for 2004)\u2014\n\nnamely, in phosphoric acid fuel cells, as a chemical wet etchant, for metal surface treatment as \n\na pickling agent (to remove oxides on steel), for chemical polishing of aluminum, as a dilute \n\nsolution in food additives, for catalytic applications, and for waste water treatment (Villalha et \n\nal., 2008).  \n\n \n\nRed and white phosphorus are intermediates used in the production of phosphides, such as \n\naluminum phosphides, and in the production of Phosphine (Villalha et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nThe production of elemental phosphorus is necessary for the production of thermal \n\nphosphoric acid, red phosphorus, and a group of organic and inorganic phosphorus \n\ncompounds that are categorized under the heading various phosphorus compounds. \n\nElemental phosphorus production totals 750,000 metric tons of P, as an annual estimate, of \n\nwhich 83% goes to thermal phosphoric acid production. The remainder (0.12 Mt P/year \n\nestimated for 2004) goes to various phosphorus compounds (Villalha et al., 2008). \n\n \n\n Apart from thermal and wet acid production, phosphate rock is also used in the production of \n\nnormal superphosphates and nitric phosphates (both fertilizers). These forms are produced by \n\n\n\n 19 \n  \n\nacidulation of phosphate rock with sulfuric acid, by acidulation with acid nitric, respectively. \n\nFor 2004, estimated production figures for normal superphosphates were 0.003 Mt of P \n\n(Lauriene 2003), and the same for nitric phosphates. Direct uses of phosphate rock account for \n\n1 Mt of P on 2004 based on estimations from Villalha 2008. \n\nStatistical information indicates that 10% of P is lost in transportation and handling (Lauriente \n\n2003), this figure is 1.89 Mt P/yr in the year 2004. Villalha estimates 0.92 Mt P/yr is used in \n\nother uses of phosphate rock concentrate. \n\n \n\n5.3. Phosphorus flows on nature and human uses \n \n\nMost of phosphoric acid obtained by different process is used as fertilizer in crop lands, in \n\nIndustry and household and also as feed grade additives. \n\n5.3.1. Crop Harvests \nThe use of phosphates to nourish agricultural soils aims to replenish the removal of \n\nphosphorus from soil by harvests and erosion losses. Adopting the average phosphorus \n\ncontents in crops and the harvest index (Smil, 1999), the global crop production harvested 12.7 \n\nMt P from soils in 2005; on the basis of the world agricultural production database (FAO \n\n2006a). \n\nGiven that natural weathering and atmospheric deposition cannot compensate for the amount \n\nof phosphorus uptake from soils, application of phosphates, in both inorganic and organic \n\nforms, becomes essential to sustain today\u2019s harvests. Although most inorganic phosphates \n\napplied to soils come from chemical fertilizers, the means of organic phosphorus reuse are \n\ndiverse. The most direct means is to recycle crop residues in situ. If we assume that roughly \n\nhalf of the annual output of crop residues (mostly cereal straw) is not removed from fields, the \n\namount of the direct reuse of crop residues on the soil is about 2.2 Mt P/yr (Yi Liu et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nAccording with the present flow chart the crop lost is 3 Mt P/yr, this value is consistent with a \n\nrecent MFA (Cordell et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n5.3.2. Animal \n \n\nThe animals are feed using the crop harvests, according to the global Food Balance Sheet (FBS) \n\nin 2003, livestock consumed 36% of the harvested cereals (excluding the amount of cereals \n\nprocessed for beer), 21% of the harvested starchy roots, and 20%of the harvested pulses (FAO, \n\n2006b). Consequently, the annual livestock consumption of phosphorus in the harvests \n\naccounted for about 2.9 Mt P/yr (Yi Liu et al., 2008).  \n\nApart from the consumption of crop harvests, the animals also graze the vegetation and the \n\ninput is 12.1 Mt P/yr by (Cordell, 2009). \n\n \n\n\n\n 20 \n  \n\nThe animals have an annual consumption via feed additives. Around 6% of global yield of \n\nphosphoric acid has been processed as animal feed-grade additives since 2000 (Brasnett, 2002; \n\nPotashCorp, 2004), so the input is 0.86 Mt P/yr. \n\nSome part of crop residues is used as animal fodder. The reuse ratio of crop residues (straws of \n\nrice, wheat, and corn) as fodder is very different in developed countries compared with \n\ndeveloping countries. Given that 70% of world livestock are raised in developing countries, \n\nwhere commercial feeds are less used and the global recycling rate of crops straws as fodder is \n\nabout 25% (Yi Liu et al. 2008), so we have 1.1 Mt P/yr. \n\nIf we add all values above the total input on animal is around 17 Mt P/yr, taking in account \n\nthat in developing countries usually they recycle various industrial byproducts and kitchen \n\norganic wastes, the value can be 20% higher (Yi Liu et al., 2008), resulting in a total of 20.4 Mt \n\nP/yr.   \n\n \n\nThe phosphorus flux to feed animals (excluding the grazing vegetation consumption) is mainly \n\nconsumed by animals in confined facilities, whereas the world\u2019s cultivated and natural \n\npastures provide a major source of phosphorus for unconfined animals. Probably the \n\nmaximum recoverable phosphorus for croplands comes from the confined animals (Yi Liu et \n\nal., 2008), recently Cordell estimates that 8 Mt of P/yr goes to recycling and 7 Mt of P/yr is lost \n\non landfill and water.  \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Household and Industry  \n \n\nIn this compartment we assume that the household and the Industry are connected, because \n\nthe amount of production of phosphorus is used to produce chemicals, materials, detergents \n\nand posterior used in household. \n\nIn the year 2004 the global production of phosphorus for uses in industry was 1.32 Mt/yr of P \n\n(Villalha et al., 2008).  \n\nCalculations based on Smil (2000a, 2002) suggest the total phosphorus content in annual \n\nglobal agricultural harvests 7 Mt P/yr is processed for feed and food fibre, 2.9 Mt  of P/yr goes \n\nto feed animals (it was mentioned above) and 3.5 Mt of P/yr goes to the food commodities \n\n(Cordell et al., 2009). \n\nIf we assume a global average dietary consumption of 1,400 mg P/capita, human excreta \n\ncontains about 3.3 Mt P/yr, of which urban and rural populations generate 1.6 Mt P/yr and 1.7 \n\nMt P/yr, respectively (Liu et al., 2008). Cordell estimates that the organic solid waste from food \n\ncommunities is around 1.2 Mt of P/yr. Adding 3.3 Mt P/yr from human excreta, 1.2 Mt P/yr \n\nand consider that all P produced from industry (to make detergents and chemicals) is waste, \n\nthe amount of household and industry is 5.82 Mt P/yr. \n\nThere is also an output from the household and industry to the nature loss, this output is for \n\nexample garden wastes, animal excreta (pets), and data from this amount of P loss was not \n\navailable. \n\n\n\n 21 \n  \n\n \n\n5.3.4. Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) \n \n\nIt is now even more important to recycle P from waste streams, in chapter 7; different ways to \n\nrecycle P from waste streams is shown. \n\nIt is estimated that 0.3 Mt P/yr can be recycle from the organic wastes (Cordell et al., 2009). It \n\nis also estimated that 10% (0.3 Mt P/yr) of human excreta can be recycle from human excreta, \n\neither intentionally or not, we have some examples from poor urban farmers in Pakistan \n\ndiverting the city\u00b4s untreated wastewater to irrigate and fertilize the soils. These small \n\namounts contribute a recycle flow of 0.5 Mt P/yr. The remainder is lost on landfill as sludge \n\nand organic waste (1.2 Mt P/yr as sludge and 1 Mt P/yr as organic waste), on MFA flow chart is \n\na total of 2.2 Mt P/yr (Cordell et al. 2009), and going backwards on mass balance we obtain \n\n2.72 Mt P/yr lost as sewage (Cordell et al., 2009).  \n\nThe P content on the sludge and sewage can be recovery, is not considered as a loss on the \n\nnature. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 22 \n  \n\n \n\n5.4. The phosphorus resource reserve inventory \n \n\nThe present agriculture is dependent on regular imputs of phosphate fertilizer derived from \n\nmined rock to replenish the phosphorus removed from the soil by growing and harvesting of \n\ncrops. \n\nEvery year the mine production increases because the world population is growing and the \n\ncrops are not only for food supply but also for diferents uses, for example the production of \n\nbiodiesel. As we can see on Fig. 8 untill the 1940s the utilization of phosphate rock was stable, \n\nbut since 1950 the use has increased and the peaked production was in 1988 with 166 Mt of \n\nphosphate rock. During the 1990s, production dropped to low values (30 % decline) due to \n\nsocial-economic-political problems in the Eastern Block countries and also due to \n\nenvironmental pressures (Villalha et al., 2008). From 2001 onward, there has been growth at a \n\nrate that is projected to continue into the future (Lauriente 2003).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 World Production of Phosphate Rock in Mt over the years, data from statistics of \n\nUSGS.  \n\nThree new phosphate rock mines are planned for development over the next decade in Florida \n\nto replace existing mines. The permitting process, however, has been delayed by opposition \n\nfrom local governments concerned about environmental and water use issues. In Idaho, one \n\ncompany received approval from the U.S. Forest Service to expand its mine and another \n\ncompany was developing a new mine to replace its existing mine that is near depletion. \n\nWorldwide phosphate rock production was estimated to have increased, primarily in China and \n\nNorth Africa (USGS, 2009).  \n\n \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n1\n9\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n2\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n3\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n4\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n5\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n6\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n7\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n8\n0\n\n1\n9\n\n9\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n7\n\nWold Utilization of Phosphate Rock\n\nWold Utilization (Mt)\n\n\n\n 23 \n  \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Mine production in 2007 and a estimation of 2008 in the diferent countries of the \n\nworld, also the reserves and the reserves base.

Phosphate rock resources occur principally as sedimentary \n\nmarine phosphorites. The largest sedimentary deposits are found in northern Africa, China, the \n\nMiddle East, and the United States. Significant igneous occurrences are found in Brazil, \n\nCanada, Russia, and South Africa. Large phosphate resources have been identified on the \n\ncontinental shelves and on seamounts in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. High \n\nphosphate rock prices have renewed interest in exploiting offshore resources of Mexico and \n\nNamibia (USGS, 2009).  \n\nReserves of phosphorus can be reserve base or reserve. Reserve Base, representing the part of \n\nthe identified resource that meets specified minimum physical and chemical criteria related to \n\ncurrent mining and production practices (Fig. 9). Reserves, representing the part of the reserve \n\nbase which could be economically extracted or produced at the time of determination (Fig. \n\n10). The term reserves need not signify that extraction facilities are in place and operative. \n\nReserves include only recoverable materials (USGS, 2009).  \n\n \n\nThe availability of the reserves is affect also for political problems in the world. China has one \n\nof the most reserves of phosphate rock, and they have enough phosphate rock for own uses, \n\nthe remained can be exported, but the export taxes from China government are very high, so \n\nthe price of phosphate rock reach high values (questionnaire interview with Schjoerring, 2009).  \n\n \n\n\n\n 24 \n  \n\n \n \n\nFigure 9 - Graphic showing the percentage of reserves base of P in the world (USGS, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Graphic showing the percentage of reserves of P in the world (USGS, 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n7%\n\n3% 1%\n\n0%\n\n21%\n\n2%\n\n2%\n\n4%\n\n45%\n\n2%\n0%\n\n5%\n2%\n\n0%\n\n1%\n\n5%\n\nReserve base In The World\n\nUnited Sates\n\nAustralia\n\nBrazil\n\nCanada\n\nChina\n\nEgypt\n\nIsrael\n\nJordan\n\nMorocco / W.

If every year \n\nthe mined phosphate rock is around 22 Mt/yr (phosphorus production on 2008 USGS 2009), \n\nand each year the consumption of phosphorus increases because of the food demand, the \n\nreserves of phosphate rock will be finished in about 90 years, or maybe even less. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 11 - Relationship between various scenarios for P2O5 consumption and the lifetime of \n\nreserves, assuming 2%, 2.5%, 3% and the most likely increase in P2O5 consumption (EFMA, \n2000). \n\n \n\nThe two graphics above highlights very well that the use of phosphoric acid is increasing on the \n\nnext years as the lifetime reserves is drop, and the year 2060, the phosphate rock could be \n\nexhausted at worst.      \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 26 \n  \n\n6. Value assessment/impact assessment  \n \n\nIn this chapter will discuss the different impacts in case of depletion of phosphate rock and its \n\neffects on the crop yields, humans and animals. It will show some ways to recovery P from \n\nwaste streams and also technologies in order to reduce the environmental impact. \n\nThe amount of phosphorus in the world\u2019s soils is roughly 90\u00d710\n3\n to 200\u00d710\n\n3\n Mt P, according to \n\nvarious estimates. Although the total phosphorus content of soils is large, only a small fraction \n\nis available to biota in most soils. This constitutes an available phosphorus pool containing \n\n2,000 to 2,600 Mt P. A larger amount, in the range of 27\u00d710\n6\n to 840\u00d710\n\n6\n Mt P, can be found in \n\nthe oceans. The sea water contains 80\u00d710\n3\n to 120\u00d710\n\n3\n Mt P, and the rest is accumulated in \n\nsediments (Liu et al., 2008). \n\nThe distribution, dynamics, and availability of phosphorus in soil are controlled by a \n\ncombination of biological, chemical, and physical processes. These processes deserve special \n\nattention, as a considerable proportion of the applied phosphate is transformed into insoluble \n\ncalcium, iron, or aluminum phosphates. On average, only a small proportion, perhaps 15% to \n\n20% of the total amount of phosphorus in the plant, comes directly from the fertilizer applied \n\nto the crop. The remainder comes from soil reserves (Schjoerring; Yiu et all.2008) \n\n \n\n \n\nIf the input of fertilizers in the soils is around 18 Mt P per year (data from the MFA flow chart) \n\nand 20% of P on the plant comes from the fertilizers. Considering that the amount of P \n\nconsumed for crop production is 12 Mt of P per year, the crops only use 2.4 Mt P/yr from the \n\nfertilizers. We can thus conclude that per year we have 15.4 Mt P/yr of losses from the \n\nfertilizer input as show in Fig. 12. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 12 \u2013 Zoom of MFA flow chart showing how much fertilizer is used on the plants. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 27 \n  \n\n6.1. Consequences of phosphorus depletion \n \n\nA deficit of phosphorus affects not only plant grow and its development but also the crop \n\nyields, along with affecting the quality of seeds. Deficiency can also delay the ripening of crops \n\nwhich can set back the harvests, risking the quality of the product. \n\n \n\nTo successfully produce the next generations of plants, seeds or grains must store phosphorus \n\nso that the seedling has enough to develop its first roots and shoots. Then, as the root system \n\ndevelops, the growing plant will be able to take up the phosphorus it requires from the soil, \n\nproviding the adequate reserves (EMFA, 2000).  \n\n \n\n \n\nThe effect on crop yields can be seeing (Table 3) on the simple experiment done in 1899 on \n\nfertilizer deficit soil in England. \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Results of an experiment done in England (EMFA, 2000).  \n\n \n\n \n\n None Nitrogen Nitrogen plus \nPhosphorus \n\n Yield, t/ha \n \n\nWinter wheat grain \n1900 \u2013 1919 \n\n1.56 1.83 2.25 \n \n\nSpring barley grain \n1900 \u2013 1919 \n\n1.29 1.69 2.10 \n \n\nMangold roots \n1906 \u2013 1919 \n\n15.60 17.60 40.40 \n\n \n\nAnalyzing the results of the experiment, we can see that with only nitrogen the crop yields are \n\nbetter, but by also adding phosphorus the final result is much better. So phosphorus addition \n\nincreases the production 2.3 times. \n\n \n\n6.1.1. Plant nutrition  \n \n\nThe relationship between plant nutrition, soil texture, root growth, and the availability of \n\nnutrients in the soil can influence the efficient use of phosphorus in agriculture. \n\n \n\nPlant nutrition, is considered in terms of the individual elements required by the plant. These \n\ninclude nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, carbon, sulphur, hydrogen and many others. Plant \n\nroots take up all nutrients from the aqueous solution in the soil apart from carbon, hydrogen \n\nand oxygen, which are acquired from carbon dioxide in the air via the leaves and the water in \n\nthe soil (Fig. 13) (EFMA, 2000).  \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 28 \n  \n\nThe root hair is very important for the nutrients uptake to the plant, if the soil is not fertile in \n\nphosphorus, it can influence the development of root plant. On a document of EFMA is shown \n\nan example of root development of the same plant on different soils. On Fig. 13 is evident the \n\ndevelopment of root plant on fertile phosphorus soil (a) and the poor development on soil \n\nwithout phosphorus (EFMA, 2000). \n\n \n\nBut as is shown on plant (b) the roots can be less developed but agricultural specialist believe \n\nthat the plant can adapt in case the soil P is not available, for example the main root hair is \n\nmore extended to uptake P from other soil layers with no deficit on the plant (Questionnaire \n\nInterview with Schjoerring, 2009).   \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Root Hair development on soil with P (a) and on the poor soil P (b). (From EFMA, \n\n2000) \n\n \n\n \n\n6.2. Questionnaire  \n \n\n \n\nIn order to understand better the relations between the P on the soil and the P available on \n\nthe soils, and also to understand the consequences/impact on the crops, humans feed and \n\nanimal production, a questionnaire was prepared to present to two agricultural specialists, \n\nGitte Rub\u00e6k from University of Aarhus and Jan Schjorring from The University of Copenhagen.  \n\n \n\nThe main questions are as follows: \n\n \n\n1) From the P pool in the soil, I would like to have more information/understanding \nabout the equilibrium between the P available and the P not available for plants. \n\na. What happens to the crops yield when the minimum P dosage stops but P \navailable to plants is present in the soil?  \n\nb. What happens to the crops yield (both for humans and animals) when the \nminimum P dosage has stopped and the P available to plants in no more \n\npresent in the soil? \n\n \n\n(a) (b) \n\n\n\n 29 \n  \n\nWe suppose that when the minimum P dosage stops, there will be a gradual drop in crop yields \n\n(for both humans and animals), however, after the P available to plants in the soil has been \n\nused up, there will be a gradual drop in crop yields, but a big drop on animal yield, because we \n\nthink that not only the crop yield will be drop, put also the P percentage contained in the crops \n\n(if there is less available P on the soil influence the uptake plant). So if the P Percentage in the \n\ncrops is less, possible will be influenced the development of the animals. On the humans we \n\nthink that a drop of P on the crop yield will not influence, because the P intake of the humans \n\nit\u2019s bigger than recommended daily intake.  \n\nThe following diagrams highlight this hypothesis. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2) We understand that the changes in the P pool are based on the differences in space \nand time, depending on various places, soil types, crops etc. How should be explained \n\nthe above hypothesis keeping this in mind? \n\n3) There are several technologies available for mitigating the problem of P depletion and \ndecrease of P in the P Pool. Some of them are \u2013 \n\na. Enhancing P recycling \u2013 from waste streams such as Meat &amp; Bone Meal, \nwastewater sludge, human excreta, etc. \n\nb. Enhancing P uptake \u2013 from the addition of an enzyme that enhances phosphate \nfertility. \n\nc. Enhancing P uptake of plants by genetic modifications. \n4) Do you have any information about Danish experiences and test fields which were \n\nbeing studied for soil fertility with regard to P without the addition of any fertilizer. I \n\nwas informed about such studies by my supervisor. \n\nCrop \n\nYield  \n\nTime  Standard  \n\nminimum P  \nEnd of \n\navailable P   \n\nFood crop yield/dry matter/hectare/year  \n\nFeed crop yield/dry matter/hectare/year  \n\nEnd of \n\navailable P  \n\nTime  Standard \n\nminimum P  \n\nAnimal \n\nYield  \n\n\n\n 30 \n  \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom the answers that we got from the agricultural specialists, the hypothesis is discussed with \n\ndifferent scenarios projecting the consequences if the phosphorus reserves are depleted. \n\nThese are some of the qualitative projected scenarios.     \n\n6.2.1. Hypothesis for the consequences on the crops \n \n\nThe impacts of phosphorus depletion on crop yields depends on the different kind of soils such \n\nas overfertilized soils, tropical soils where the availability of P is reduced, the type of crops \n\nproduced. Agronomists agree that the differences in the input of P will affect the crop yield \n\nand the reduction in P input will lead to reduction in crop yield. \n\n1\nst\n\n case: General soils: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 \u2013 Graphic showing the possible consequence on the crop yields in case of no \n\nfertilization during a long time, on general soils. \n\n \n\nIf the input of fertilizer stops, on general soil, the crop yields will drop until P is available on the \n\nsoil. After reaching the time that is not P available on the soils the crop yields will decline more \n\n(fig. 14), but both agronomists, agree that in these case the plants will have a period of \n\nadaptation, and the roots hair will be longer to uptake P from other levels of the soil. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCrop \n\nYield\n\nNo Fertilizer P \n\ninput \n\nAvailable P on \n\nthe soil \n\nNot Available \n\nP on the soil \nTime  \n\n\n\n 31 \n  \n\n \n\n2\nst\n\n case: Overfertilized soils: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n    \n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Graphic showing possible consequence on the crop yields in case of no fertilization \n\nduring a long time, in overfertilize soils. \n\n \n\nIn case of overfertilize soils, e.g. recycle animal manure , or an input of P fertilizer above of \n\nrequirement needs of the soil, it is not expect a big drop of crop yields and the time of P \n\navailable on the soil will be bigger than in general soils (Fig. 15). In this situation it will take \n\nlonger to finish the P available. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCrop \n\nYield\n\nNo Fertilizer P \n\ninput \n\nAvailable P in \n\nthe soil \n\nNot Available \n\nP on the soil \nTime  \n\n\n\n 32 \n  \n\n \n\n3\nrd\n\n Case: Too Low available P in the soil \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nFigure 16 \u2013 Graphic showing possible consequence on the crop yields in case of no fertilization \n\nduring a long time, on too low available P on the soil. \n\n \n\nIf the soil has too low available P, as tropical soils, the P is not available in solution but it is \n\nadsorbed with different compounds, it is expected a reduction on the start and then a steep \n\nreduction when it is finishing the P available. However, it will be an equilibrium at a level too \n\nlow to sustain viable production, and then a very low level of yield (Fig. 16).

Consequence of Human and Animal  \n \n\nHumans and animals also need to obtain an adequate supply of phosphorus from their food \n\nand feeding stuffs. Phosphorus deficiency affects many of the essential processes on which the \n\nlife of an animal depends, just as it does in plants. Phosphates are added to the diet of pigs and \n\npoultry to ensure they do not suffer any deficiency, and to prevent health problems, weak \n\nbones and impaired fertility. \n\n \n\nBecause much of the phosphorus ingested by animals is excreted in the faeces, animal \n\nmanures, when properly used, are valuable sources of phosphorus. Phosphorus is the second \n\nmost abundant mineral element in the human body (the first is calcium), accounting for more \n\nthan 20 percent of the body\u2019s minerals. Calcium phosphates, for example, are the major \n\nconstituent of the skeletal bones and teeth and contain 85% of the body\u2019s total phosphorus. \n\nLack of phosphorus not only affects bone structure, but also appetite, growth and fertility \n\n(EFMA 2000).  \n\n \n\nAbove, on the questions, we thought that we will have a decrease not only on the crops yields \n\nbut also a big impact on animals, but the decreased input of phosphorus will reduce grain yield \n\nmuch more than the P percentage in the grain.  \n\n \n\nOn the Human, even the percentage in the grain is less, it will not be such big impact in the \n\nhumans, because the typical daily consumption is 1,500 mg P/capita for adults. This is well \n\nabove the dietary reference intake (DRI), the amount a human individual should take in each \n\nday, as recommended by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, a part of \n\nthe U.S. National Academy of Science. The U.S. recommended intakes are 700 mg/capita for \n\nadults over 18 years of age, 1,250 mg/capita for young adults between 9 and 18 years of age, \n\nand 500 mg/capita for children (Villalha et al., 2008).  \n\n \n\nAs an answer of the questionnaire Schjoerring believes that the impact on animals doesn\u2019t \n\nmake sense, e.g. the monogastric animals, like pigs, they are not able to digest the P content \n\non the crops, for which they are given P supplements in their feed. Less P in the crops will \n\nmean either additional supplements will need to be provided to the animals or there may be \n\nless loss of P to the environment via animal excreta causing lesser environmental impacts. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 34 \n  \n\n \n\n6.3. Long-Term Experiments in different countries  \n \n\nA different experiment has been performed in order to evaluate soil and crops performance \n\nwith or without fertilizer.   \n\n6.3.1. Denmark  \n \n\nIn Denmark it has being developed a study about crop and soil P (in eight fields experiments \n\ninitiated in 1975) to long-term P fertilization strategies at typical Danish agricultural soils. One \n\nof the main objectives was to determine for how long P fertilization could be omitted without \n\naffecting yields, carried out by Gitte Holton Rub\u00e6k and Erik Sibbesen.  \n\nThe P treatments were 0 kg P ha\n-1\n\nyear\n-1\n\n, 15 kg P ha\n-1\n\nyear\n-1\n\n, 30 kg P ha\n-1\n\nyear\n-1\n\n and 70 kg P ha\n-\n\n1\nyear\n\n-1\n every fifth year as super phosphate. Nitrogen was also applied as well other plant \n\nnutrients, lime and pesticides according to needs.  \n\nThe effects of P and N fertilization on crop yields were tested with an ante-dependence \n\nanalysis of covariance on the relative yields. With this analysis it is possible to deduct \n\ninformation   on where the time profiles of the treatments differ from each other.  This \n\nanalysis is a modified multivariate analysis, and therefore it does not depend on variance \n\nhomogeneity, independence of data or sphericity of the residuals as traditional or adapted \n\nunivariate analysis or variance do. The first step in the ante-dependence analysis is \n\ndetermination of the order or structure of ante-dependence. This means determining the \n\nlowest number of previous measurements, which improves the model significantly, when \n\ninclude as covariates.  If the order of covariance is one, only the measurement of the \n\npreceding year will be included in the analysis as covariate. If the order of ante-dependence is \n\ntwo, the two preceding years will be included as covariates and so on. An ante-dependence \n\nstructure of zero will result in a univarate analysis of variance with no correction on previous \n\nyears.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 35 \n  \n\nTable 4- The order of ante-dependence and overall effects of N and P fertilization on the \n\nrelative yields at each experimental site (Rub\u00e6k and Sibbesen, 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\nNote: P is in kg P ha\n-1\n\nyear\n-1\n\n. \n\nAnalyzing the table 4 with data of this long-term experiment it was proved that P-fertilization \n\nhad no significant overall effects on the crop yields at any experimental sites before 1990. \n\nFrom 1990 and onwards the overall effect of P fertilization were significant at R\u00f8nhave, \n\nTylstrup and Borris. In all cases, except at Borris in 1992, the yields were significantly lower in \n\nthe 0 kg P ha\n-1\n\nyear\n-1\n\n treatment then in 30 kg P ha\n-1\n\nyear\n-1\n\n. \n\nThe percentage of P in the crop components in general varied little among treatments, but \n\nthere was a tendency to lower P concentrations in the 0 kg P ha\n-1\n\nyear\n-1\n\n in the later years at the \n\nstations were also yields were depressed (Rub\u00e6k and Sibbesen, 2000). \n\n \n\n6.3.2. Finland  \n \n\nSince 1978 a farm in southern Finland is being used to analyze the growing of cereals without \n\nfertilization of potassium and phosphorus, during thirty years. The soil had been cultivated \n\nconventionally for decades before the experiment started. \n\nThe goal of this project was to investigate how long it would take before a deficiency of the \n\nmajor nutrients phosphorus and potassium occurred under conditions associated with \n\ntraditional crop production methods.  \n\n \n\nThe design of the experiment consists of two factors with two levels each: without and with \n\nphosphorus and potassium fertilizer (36 and 70 kg ha\n-1\n\n yr\n-1\n\n, respectively) as well as without and \n\nwith an extra superphosphate application (P 36 kg ha\n-1\n\n yr\n-1\n\n). The treatments were replicated at \n\nleast 4 times. They were arranged in plots of 20 by 15 m or 5 by 15 m (extra superphosphate). \n\nNitrogen has been applied at 100 kg ha\n-1\n\n yearly.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 36 \n  \n\nOn the end, the results of the total dry matter yield (grain + straw) decreased from about 5000 \n\nkg ha\n-1\n\n to a level of 3000 kg ha\n-1\n\n when only nitrogen was applied. After 30 years of nitrogen \n\nand phosphorus fertilizer the yield level was 4000 kg ha\n-1\n\n. NPK application kept the yield level \n\nalmost constant. The surplus annual P rate of 70 kg ha\n-1\n\n seemed to increase the yield a little \n\nmore.  \n\n \n\nOver thirty years a significant depletion of P and K in soil occurred when they were not given in \n\nfertilizers. This caused a reduction in crop yield. An abundant P application has exceeded the \n\ncrop uptake very clearly prevented the yield reduction but did not raise the extractable P \n\nconcentration in the soil. Severe K deficiency did not start to appear until 20 years of growing \n\ncereal without fertilizer K. K application compensating for the uptake by the crop did not \n\nprevent the decrease of its extractable concentration in this soil, but this decrease did not \n\naffect crop yield (Jaakkola, 1997).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 37 \n  \n\n7. Options for sustainable phosphorus use and management \n \n\nCommon responses to resource scarcity problems include higher prices, more efficient \n\nresource use, the introduction of alternatives, and the recovery of the resource after use. The \n\nuse of phosphorus is becoming more efficient, especially in Europe. Farmers in Europe and \n\nNorth America are increasingly avoiding over fertilization, and are plugging straw and animal \n\nmanure into agricultural soils, partly to recycle phosphorus (Cordell et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\nAt this moment, it is important to figure out if it is possible to reduce the waste streams from P \n\ncycle, and if it is not possible to reduce the waste, it is important to develop methodologies to \n\nrecover P from waste streams or recycle. \n\nOn chapter 3, analyzing the MFA flow chart we can see that a large amount of P is lost in the \n\nnature during the cycle. Before the phosphorus reserve be exhausted, is important to reduce, \n\nas possible, the depletion of P. \n\nThe phosphorus can be recovered from the food production and consumption system and \n\nreused as a fertilizer either directly or after intermediate processing. As example, P can be \n\nrecovered and/or reused from: \n\n\u2022 Plugging crop residues back into the soil; \n\u2022 Food processing plants and food retailers; \n\u2022 Human and animal excreta; \n\u2022 Meat and bone meal; \n\u2022 Manure fibre; \n\u2022 Sewage sludge; \n\u2022 Wastewater.  \n\nTo increase the life expectancy of world\u00b4s phosphorus resources we have two possibilities, \n\nrecycling by recovery from municipal and other waste products, the second one is improving \n\nthe efficient use in agriculture of both phosphatic mineral fertilizer and animal manure (Cordell \n\net al., 2009).  \n\nSome countries have already programs to recycle waste. At least a municipal waste water \n\ntreatment plant in Portugal is processing the sludge to sell as fertilizer. In some cities from \n\nPakistan and Asia, more than 25% of urban vegetables are irrigate with them own wastewater \n\n(Cordell et al., 2009). There are different studies about reuse and recycle of rich phosphorus \n\nstreams, on this chapter it will be mentioned some of them. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 38 \n  \n\n7.1. Phosphorus Recovery from Biological Sewage sludge ash using a \nwet sulfuric acid process  \n\nThe aim of Michael\u2019s project (Phosphorus Recovery from Biological Sewage sludge ash using a \n\nwet sulfuric acid process) was to examine phosphorus recovery from biological sewage sludge \n\nash using a wet sulphuric acid process as recovery method. Different process steps as well as \n\nspecific parameters influencing the possibility of recovering phosphorus from sewage sludge \n\nash were identified: \n\n\u2022 The waste water treatment process \no Use of precipitation chemicals \no Phosphorus content of the sludge \n\n \n\n\u2022 The incineration process \no Incineration temperature \n\n \n\n\u2022 Recovery of phosphorus by the sulphuric acid \no Acid concentration \no Temperature \no Stirring \no Particle size \n\nBiological waste water treatment produces sewage sludge with higher phosphorus \n\nconcentration than traditional waste water treatment and furthermore elimination of \n\nprecipitation chemicals minimizes the iron and aluminum content this is highly desirable when \n\nrecovering phosphorus. Analysis of dried sewage sludge Analysis of ash from biological sewage \n\nsludge from Helsingborg, VA-Verket shows that the ash contains 37 % P2O5. This is almost \n\ntwice the amount of the phosphorus in ash from traditional sewage sludge and above the \n\nminimum criteria for P2O5 in low grade rock phosphate. Biological sewage sludge ash is \n\nreported to have an iron content of as little as 1.6%. The iron content in Helsingborg ash is \n\n5.7% this is 23% lower than ash from Lynetten incineration plant.  The biological sewage sludge \n\nash fulfilled all threshold values given by the Danish sludge regulations. \n\nThe incineration temperature influences the plan availability of the phosphorus. When \n\nincineration temperature is increased from 500?C to 700?C the plant availability decreases. \n\nIncinerating dried, biological sewage sludge from Helsingborg at a temperature of 875?C, the \n\namount of plant available phosphorus is reduced by a factor 40. Phosphorus is found as \n\nhydroxyapatite in the ash.  \n\n A series of experiments of phosphorus recovery from biological sewage sludge were carried \n\nout. The main influential parameters on the sulphuric acid recovery process are stirring, \n\nparticle size, sulphuric acid concentration and temperature. The experiments showed that it is \n\npossible to recover 40 % of the phosphorus in the ash. High sulphuric acid concentration may \n\nhave caused coating and hampered the recovery of phosphorus. The produced phosphoric \n\nacids had an average P2O5 concentration of 4.4 %. Analysis showed that the threshold values in \n\nthe Danish Sludge regulation were fulfilled. After a concentration step yielding a tenfold \n\n\n\n 39 \n  \n\nincrease in P2O5 concentration the threshold values were still fulfilled and furthermore \n\nspecifications for low grade rock phosphate were fulfilled. \n\nThe technical feasibility analysis states that biological waste water treatment without addition \n\nof precipitations chemicals is technical feasible when the discharge threshold value for \n\nphosphorus given by the local municipalities is above 0.4 mg P/L. Incineration of sewage \n\nsludge is well established  and considered technical feasible. Recovery of phosphorus from \n\nsewage sludge ash as phosphoric acid by reaction with sulphuric acid is considered technical \n\nfeasible and 40 - 90% recovery is expected. \n\nThe economical feasibility analysis states that the process generates a surplus of 240 DKK per \n\nton of sewage sludge ash, with a total depreciable plant cost of 29,340,000 DKK (Michael, \n\n2009).  \n\n \n\n7.2. Reuse of human an animal excreta \n \n\nAs was mentioned on chapter 3, human excreta can be reuse intentionally or not. Since a long \n\ntime the Chinese people used the human excreta to fertilize the soils. Nowadays, technologies \n\nare being developed to recovery human urine. According with Swedish and Zimbabwe studies \n\nthe nutrients of one persons\u2019 urine is sufficient to grow 50- 100% of the food requirements of \n\nanother person (Cordell et all.2008).   \n\nUrine is a very useful waste, it can be use as a fertilizer because content a lot of the most \n\nimportant nutrients to fertilize the soil, with a percentage of 80% of nitrogen, 55% of \n\nphosphorus and 60% of potassium , as it is shown on Fig. 17 an example from Sweden. \n\n \n\nFigure 17 \u2013 Content of major plant nutrients and volume in Swedish domestic waste water. \n\nDaily mean excretion per person and day is: 14 g N, 2 g P and 4 g K in a volume of 150-200 liter. \n\n(Graphic from WHO 2009). \n\n \n\nSweden is a good example of reusing urine, on the beginners of 1990 porcelain urine-diverting \n\ntoilets ware introduced.  This system constitutes on separate flushing mechanism for the urine \n\nand faeces or the flush rinses both bowls. The faeces may also be collected dry for composting. \n\n\n\n 40 \n  \n\nThe urine is usually collected in a tank placed underground or in a basement under the house. \n\nWhen the tank is full the urine is transported to a farm for later use as a fertilizer on \n\nagricultural land. Before its utilization the urine is stored either in the housing area or near the \n\nfield, on the Fig. 18 is shown a scheme. For individual households the urine may also be \n\nutilized in the garden directly from the collection tank, without separate storage. \n\nInvestigations were conducted on both small-scale and large-scale systems (WHO, 2009).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure18 \u2013 Swedish scheme to recovery human urine. (From WHO 2009) \n\n \n\nNowadays, not only in Sweden is being develop reuse of human excreta. In Zimbabwe was \n\ndeveloped toilets that make compost for the crops, most of the rural population of Africa do \n\nnot have access to safe and reliable toilets , so it is a good way to create sanitary safety and \n\nreuse the nutrients to the crops with low-cost (EcoSanRes 2007). \n\n \n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) has guidelines in order to minimize the risks for \n\ntransmission of infectious diseases and as a part of risk management. These guidelines are \n\nrecommendations an them involve parameters such the possible pathogens on the urine \n\ndepending on the temperature and time of storage, and recommended crops (WHO, 2009).   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n 41 \n  \n\n7.3. Novozymes \n \n\nConsider that at this moment P exists in two main pools of phosphorus, the phosphate rock \n\nreserve and the phosphorus pool on the soil (P available to plants uptake). Taking account that \n\none day the reserve may be finished, is important to have an idea of how the problem can be \n\nmanaged. \n\n \n\nOn the soil we have phosphorus unavailable to \n\nfertilize, however there is on the market a fungus \n\nable to transform the phosphorus available (Fig. \n\n19).  \n\nWhen phosphate fertilizer is applied at the time \n\nof planting, it can quickly bind with calcium, \n\nmagnesium, and iron minerals in the soil, \n\nresulting in the phosphate being inaccessible to \n\nthe crop. In that moment JumpStart can be \n\napplied on the soils. \n\n \n\n Figure 19 \u2013 JumpStart is a phosphate inoculant. (Novozymes 2009) \n\n \n\nJumpStart is a fertility management tool that is applied as a seed treatment to the seed prior \n\nto planting or with the seed at planting. The active component in JumpStart is a naturally \n\noccurring soil fungus \u2013 Penicillium bilaii. As the seeds germinate and develop a root system the \n\nJumpStart fungus and the plant form a mutually beneficial relationship. The fungus grows and \n\nmultiplies along the crop roots, thriving off the root exudates and releasing organic acids into \n\nthe soil. These acids break the bonds holding the phosphate nutrient in a mineral form, \n\nreleasing the phosphate into a form the plant can access. The result is enhanced phosphate \n\nuptake allowing the crop to achieve its yield potential. \n\n \n\nCool soils, during direct or early seeding, can reduce phosphate availability due to the limited \n\nmobility or movement of phosphate in the soil. Poor early season phosphate availability can \n\nreduce early growth. JumpStart is active in cool soils as low as 4 \u00b0C and supplies an \n\nimmediately available source of phosphate to developing seedlings, resulting in quicker \n\nemergence and early vigor. \n\nJumpStart has been commercially available to North America farmers for more than 10 years, \n\nwhere it was used on approximately 5.0 million acres in 2008. In over 450 split field trials \n\nconducted in North America over the last 15 years, \u201cJumpStart\u201d has shown an average 5% to \n\n7% yield increase on a number of different crops (Novozymes, 2009).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 42 \n  \n\n8. Conclusions \n \n\nAs a main conclusion of this work the phosphorus is a real environmental problem nowadays, \n\nin my opinion it is important to develop more research work in different points of the world. It \n\nis important work with farmers in order to inform the best ways to apply the fertilizers on the \n\nsoil to reduce as much it is possible the use of fertilizers and maybe develop international \n\nrules. \n\nThe MFA flow chart can show that we have a lot of waste streams and they can be recovered \n\nand reduce the need of phosphate rock and also the phosphate\u2019s losses on the soil.  \n\nIt was discussed that the phosphorus depletion can reduce the crop yields and the plant must \n\ndevelop root to find P on another soil level. However it will not interfere on human and animal \n\nconsumption. \n\nCompanies like Novozymes, Kommunekemi and also techniques like the human excreta \n\nrecovery from Sweden are a good example how we can reduce waste streams rich in P and \n\nreduce environmental impacts, such eutrophication. But we still have to develop more \n\ntechniques, as example there are now some genetic modification studies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\n    \n\n \n\n\n\n 43 \n  \n\n9.
