Soils have different \ngranulometric, mineralogic and organic matter \ncompositions that can be modified by the usage \nand tillage of those soils. Ferreira et al. (1999a, \n1999b) found that oxisols with kaolinitic clay \nfractions led to the development of a block-type \nmacrostructure that caused the formation of \noxisols with greater bulk densities and greater \nproportion of small pores. They also reported that \noxisols with oxidic mineralogy formed porous- \nstructures with lower bulk densities due to larger \ndiameter pore spaces. Moreover, Chagas et al. \n(1997) reported that soil with a higher content of \nkaolinite in the clay fraction had a greater bulk \ndensity, lower total porosity and macroporosity \nwhen compared to other oxidic soils.  \n\nExcessive soil preparation, removal of growing \nplants from the surface and the establishment of \nannual crops combined with inappropriate tillage \npractices cause a disturbance in the balance \nbetween the soil and environment, by modifying \nits physical, chemical and biological attributes; by \nlimiting its agricultural usage, and by making it \nmore susceptible to erosion and degradation. \nThere are several studies on the effects of different \nusage and tillage systems on the physical \nproperties of soils. Overall, data show an increase \nin soil bulk density and a decrease in porosity \nwhen soils are submitted to different usage \nsystems when compared to its natural state (Hill   \net al., 1985; Cavenage et al., 1999; Beutler et al., \n2001). Carvalho et al. (1991) evaluated the effect \nof many years of conventional cultivation with \nsugarcane and observed that soils with longer \ncultivation times had a decrease in the porosity \nespecially in the macroporosity. Cerri et al. (1991) \n\n\n\nCenturion, J. F. et al. \n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \n\n726 \n\nreported that intensive cultivation of the soil with \nsugarcane had structural changes, mainly in the \nsoil surface layers. Later studies conducted by \nCarvalho (1999) showed that conventional tillage \nsystems followed by maize and sugarcane \ncultivation caused degradation of the physical \nattributes of the soil when compared to the natural \nstate. This degradation was quantified through \ngreater values of bulk density and microporosity, \nand lower values for macroporosity and total \nporosity.  \nThe decrease of total porosity and macroporosity, \nwith an increase in microporosity and soil bulk \ndensity in areas cultivated with annual crops, was \nmainly due to the intensive soil mixing during the \n\npreparation activities (Silva et al., 1986). Data \ncollected by Machado et al. (1981) showed that the \nchanges in the physical attributes of the oxisol soil \ncultivated with conventional tillage were also \nassociated with decrease in organic matter content \nwhen compared to the natural state of the soil. \nEven though Brazilian soils are mainly oxisols and \nare widely used for agriculture, little is known \nabout the differences on the physical attributes \nbetween kaolinitic and oxidic oxisols soils under \ndifferent usage systems. Therefore, the objective \nof this study was to evaluate the physical attributes \nof kaolinitic oxisol (Haplustox) and oxidic oxisol \n(Eutrustox) under different usage systems. \n \n\n \nTable 1 - Physical and chemical attributes of Haplustox and Eutrustox for the usage systems, at four different depths \n\nClay Silt FS1 CS2 OM3 Fe2O3 Al2O3 Soil Use \n........................................... g kg-1 ............................................... \n\n 0.0 - 0.1 m \nHaplustox Sugarcane 191 102 363 344 20   52   80 \n Cotton  226   77 349 348 18   57 110 \n Forest 178 115 363 344 47   57 120 \nEutrustox Sugarcane 450 300 190  60 28 279 240 \n Cotton  420 340 170  70 23 260 220 \n Forest 330 330 230 110 66 262 120 \n 0.1 - 0.2 m \nHaplustox Sugarcane 235   83 332 350 19   49   90 \n Cotton  219   88 344 349 16   57 105 \n Forest 232 100 325 343 36   57 120 \nEutrustox Sugarcane 460 290 180   70 23 280 230 \n Cotton  410 350 170   70 25 270 220 \n Forest 370 320 230   80 33 288 150 \n 0.2 - 0.3 m \nHaplustox Sugarcane 276   66 340 318 15   64   95 \n Cotton  249   77 337 337 13   73 105 \n Forest 275   66 341 318 26   60 115 \nEutrustox Sugarcane 530 220 190   60 14 284 245 \n Cotton  460 300 180   60 21 262 235 \n Forest 470 230 230   70 26 287 175 \n 0.3 - 0.4 m \nHaplustox Sugarcane 305   63 327 305 13   51 105 \n Cotton  271   89 339 301 10   59 115 \n Forest 324   52 324 300 24   69 115 \nEutrustox Sugarcane 560 220 160   60 16 298 250 \n Cotton  470 290 170   70 27 280 235 \n Forest 500 230 220   50 16 296 210 \n\n1Fine sand; 2Coarse sand; 3Organic matter \n \n \nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n \nThe experiment was carried out in a kaolinitic oxisol, \nmedium texture (Haplustox), and in oxidic oxisol, \nclayey (Eutrustox). Geographic co-ordinates of the \nexperimental area were south latitude 21\u00ba08\u201927\u201d and \n\nwest longitude 48\u00ba16\u201917\u201d, located in Jaboticabal, S\u00e3o \nPaulo state, Brazil. The weather is classified as \nmesothermic with dry winters (Cwa) by the K\u00f6ppen \nsystem. The physical and chemical characterizations of \nthe soils are shown in Table 1. \n\n\n\nPhysical Attributes of Kaolinitic and Oxidic Oxisols Resulting from Different Usage Systems \n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \n\n727 \n\nUsage systems were sugarcane (5th year), cotton \n(1th year) and forest. In the area cultivated with \nsugarcane for 30 years, practices such as \nconventional tillage using discs plow, harrow and \nchisel plow and burning were performed before \ncutting. The area cultivated with cotton was \nprepared by using discs plow, harrow and four \nleveler harrowings, and had been cultivated for 30 \nyears with annual crops. \nDisturbed and undisturbed samples were collected \nat 0.0-0.1; 0.1-0.2; 0.2-0.3, and 0.3-0.4 m depths. \nThe undisturbed samples collected with volumetric \nrings of 0.048 diameter and 0.03 m high were used \nto determine the following: bulk density according \nto Blake and Hartge (1986); microporosity by \ndrying (0.006 MPa) in a Richard pressure \nchambers with porous plate (Klute, 1986), and \ntotal porosity according to Danielson and \nSutherland (1986). The macroporosity was \nobtained by the difference between total porosity \nand microporosity. \nParticle size composition was established in \ndisturbed samples through dispersion with water \nand NaOH (0.1 mol L-1) and slow shaking for 16 \nhours, and the clay portion was determined by \npipetting method according to Day (1965). \nOrganic matter was determined by the method \ndescribed by Raij et al. (1987). Fe2O3 and Al2O3 \nwere determined through sulfuric agents according \nto Lim and Jackson (1986). \nExperimental design was entirely randomized with \nsubdivided parcels, with seven replications each. \nThe effects of the usage systems on the soils \nphysical attributes at different depths were verified \nby the variance analysis and significant means \nwere compared by Tukey test at the 0.05 \nprobability level. \n \n \nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n \nSince variance analysis did not reveal significant \ninteractions between soils vs. usage systems, are \nshown in the means of usage systems by depths for \nboth soils (Figure 1). Haplustox showed \nsignificantly higher bulk density, and lower total, \nmacro and microporosity. The highest soil bulk \ndensity and lowest total porosity, macro and \nmicroporosity were due to the lowest oxide \ncontents of Fe and Al and coarser granulometry \n(Table 1). However, soils with coarse \ngranulometry provided porous formation with \ngreater diameter, resulting in a greater \n\nmacroporosity. These traits were not observed in \nthis study. This probably was due to the fact that \nthe mineralogy of the kaolinitic clay fraction of \nHaplustox led to the formation of compact block \nstructures (Ferreira, 1999a). The greater values for \nbulk density, lower total porosity and \nmacroporosity in kaolinitic soils when compared \nto oxidic soils agree with studies conducted by \nChagas et al. (1997) and Ferreira et al. (1999b) in \nsoils with similar granulometric composition. \nAccording to Ferreira et al. (1999a), soils with \npredominantly kaolinite in the clay fraction \npresented small subangular block structures which \ncombined with other soil aspects to form pores \nthat were predominantly cavities due to the face to \nface adjustment of the kaolinite plates, thus \nresulting in greater bulk density and smaller \ndiameter pores. These authors also found that the \noxidic mineralogy of the clay fraction promoted \nthe formation of round microaggregates (<1 mm) \nthat were predominately composed of porous \npackages around the microaggregates, which \nformed granular macrostructures with a porous \nappearance \u201cin situ\u201d that promoted the formation \nof a greater quantity of a large porous and lower \nbulk density. Dematt\u00ea (1988) documented that the \nformation of very stable sand-silt size aggregates \noccured in oxidic soil due to both, clay content and \ncementing elements, or to the actions of iron and \naluminum oxides. Pinheiro-Dick and \nSchwertmann (1996) reported that hematite and \ngoethite form homogeneous microaggregates with \ngibbsite, kaolinite and quartz, thus promoting \ngreater porosity when comparing to kaolinitic \nsoils. \nThe only parameter that did not differ between the \nsoils was the macroporosity in 0.0-0.1 m depth \n(Figure 1).  This was due to the changes in the \nstructure related to the soil usage, which affected \nmainly the surface layer and was possibly more \nextensive in the more compact Haplustox. \nMoreover, macroporosity is a physical attribute \nthat reflects small changes in structure when \ncompared to the total porosity and microporosity, \nthus confirming the results obtained by Hill et al. \n(1985), Bertol (1989), Carvalho et al. (1991) and \nBeutler et al. (2001). \nCorrelation between Fe and Al oxides and the soil \nphysical attributes have shown a negative \nrelationship with soil bulk density and positive \nrelationship with microporosity and total porosity \n(Table 2), confirming the studies conducted by \nChagas et al. (1997) and Ferreira et al. (1999b).  \n\n\n\nCenturion, J. F. et al. \n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \n\n728 \n\nHowever, Ferreira et al. (1999b) found a stronger \neffect of Al oxides on the physical attributes, \nwhich was probably not observed in this study due \n\nto the contents of iron oxides being slightly greater \nthan the aluminum oxides. \n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1 - Physical attributes of Haplustox and Eutrustox at different depths.  \n \n \n \nTable 2 - Correlations between the Fe2O3 and the Al2O3 in physical attributes \n\n Correlation \n Bulk density Total porosity Macro porosity Micro porosity \n\nFe2O3   0.52** 0.80** 0.16\nNS 0.79** \n\nAl2O3 0.43* 0.69**\n  -0.03NS 0.88** \n\n** Significant at 1%; * Significant at 5%; NS Not significant \n \n \nThe effects of soil usage on the physical attributes \nwere different in Haplustox (Table 3) in relation to \nEutrustox (Table 4). Haplustox soil under cotton \ncultivation had greater bulk density in the 0.0-0.1 \nm depth when compared with sugarcane \n\ncultivation. This was caused by the intensive \npreparation of the soil using discs plow, harrow \nand four leveler harrowings in cotton, which \npulverized the soil more at this depth when \ncompared to sugarcane, which are cultivated every \n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n0.0-0.1 0.1-0.2 0.2-0.3 0.3-0.4\n\nDe pth (m)\n\nT\not\n\nal\n p\n\nor\nos\n\nit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\nHaplustox???\nEutrustox\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n0.0-0.1 0.1-0.2 0.2-0.3 0.3-0.4\n\nDe pth (m)\n\nB\nu\n\nlk\n d\n\nen\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\nM\ng \n\nm\n-3\n\n)\n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????0\n\n6\n\n12\n\n18\n\n24\n\n0.0-0.1 0.1-0.2 0.2-0.3 0.3-0.4\n\nDe pth (m)\n\nM\nic\n\nro\np\n\nor\nos\n\nit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb \n\na \n\nb ????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n???????\n\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n????????\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n0.0-0.1 0.1-0.2 0.2-0.3 0.3-0.4\n\nDe pth (m)\n\nM\nac\n\nro\np\n\nor\nos\n\nit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\na \n\nb \na \n\nb \na \n\nb \n\na a \n\nDepth (m) \n\n\n\nPhysical Attributes of Kaolinitic and Oxidic Oxisols Resulting from Different Usage Systems \n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \n\n729 \n\nfive years.

In the sugarcane area, a higher bulk \ndensity at 0.1-0.2 m depth was observed and this \nagrees with the studies done by Carvalho Filho \n(1999). According to Magalh\u00e3es (1990), soils \ncultivated annually undergo successive processes \nof compaction, which begins with as a natural \nprocess or as a forced one, due to the traffic of \nagricultural machines and decompaction through \nplowing and harrowing. \nThe forested area showed the lowest bulk density \nat all depths and the density increased with depth. \nThis was expected because it was a common \nbehavior native conditions, which was caused by \nthe decrease of organic matter content in depht and \ndue the weight of the layers of soil above.  These \ndata agreed with the studies conducted by \nCavenage et al. (1999).  Greater density values in \ncultivated soils have been documented by several \n\nstudies (Carvalho et al., 1999; Cavenage et al., \n1999; Beutler et al., 2001). \nOur results revealed that the increase in the soil \nbulk density caused a reduction in the \nmacroporosity in all depths, thus confirming the \ndata obtained by Bertol (1989), Cerri et al. (1991), \nCarvalho Filho (1999) and Beutler et al. (2001). \nMacroporosity is the first and most affected by the \ncompaction process (Bertol, 1989). This study \nshowed that the soil usage systems increased soil \nbulk density and decreased macroporosity and the \ntotal porosity in all analyzed depths when \ncompared to those from native conditions. \nReduction in macroporosity with depth in the \nforest and sugarcane area is consistent with the \ndecrease in the organic matter content with depth. \nIncreases in the total porosity and soil \nmacroporosity was observed in the area with \ncotton, in the Haplustox, as depth increases, and \nthese were probably related to the intense surface \ntraffic of machines and equipment during soil \npreparation and deep cultivation with agricultural \n\n\n\nCenturion, J. F. et al. \n\nBrazilian Archives of Biology and Technology \n\n730 \n\nimplements. These had strong effects on the \ncompaction of the surface layer when compared to \nthat from the sugarcane area.  \nThe microporosity for the forest soil was lower at \nall depth and did not increase with the density, \nwhile the macroporosity decreased in the usage \nsystems. These data agreed with those documented \nby Bertol (1989), who found that macroporosity \nwas initially affected by the increase of the bulk \ndensity followed by an increase in the \nmicroporosity. Similar results were reported by \nSecco et al. (1997), who observed differences in \nthe oxisol bulk density and in the macroporosity \n\nwhen comparing usage systems, without \nsignificant alterations in the soil microporosity. \nIn Eutrustox (Table 4), the cotton area presented \nhigher bulk density at all depths, followed by \nsugarcane.  In oxidic oxisol, Carvalho (1999) did \nnot find differences in the bulk density of the \ncultivated area with maize when compared to that \nwith sugarcane, probably due to less machine \noperations performed during soil preparation. \nCultivated soils showed greater densities at 0.0-0.3 \nm depth, and these results associated with the \nturning of the soil at that this depth.  \n\n \nTable 4 - Physical attributes of Eutrustox under different usage systems at four different depths  \n\nBulk density Total porosity Macroporosity Microporosity \nUse \n\nMg m-3 ................................ % ................................. \n0.0 - 0.1 m \n\nSugarcane 1.21 Ba 29.22 Aa   7.25 Bb 21.96 Aa \nCotton    1.34 Aab 28.44 Ba   6.02 Ba 22.42 Ab \nForest 1.05 Cb 30.81 Aa 14.58 Aa 16.23 Ba \n\n0.1 - 0.2 m \nSugarcane 1.24 Ba 30.30 Aa   8.37 Bb 21.93 Ba \nCotton  1.36 Aa 27.91 Ba   3.61 Cb 24.30 Aa \nForest 1.15 Ca 31.25 Aa 14.25 Aa 17.00 Ca \n\n0.2 - 0.3 m \nSugarcane  1.16 Bab  30.49 Aa   8.46 Bb 22.03 Aa \nCotton   1.29 Aab 28.05 Ba     4.96 Cab   23.10 Aab \nForest  1.14 Bab  30.23 Aa  13.81 Aa 16.42 Ba \n\n0.3 - 0.4 m \nSugarcane 1.10 Bb 29.87 Aa 11.25 Aa 18.61 Bb \nCotton  1.26 Ab 28.24 Ba    5.53 Bab   22.71 Aab \nForest  1.10 Bab  30.24 Aa 13.00 Aa 17.24 Ba \nCVUSE (%) 5.43 4.09 19.18 6.96 \nCVDEPTH (%) 5.21 4.91 17.64 6.43 \n\nValues with different capital letters in the columns (at the same depth) and values with different low case letters in the columns, \nbetween depths, are significantly different at the 0.05 probability level. \n \n \nCompact layers were not found in Eutrustox at \n0.0-0.3 m depth, which resulted from soil \npreparation under improper conditions, as \nobserved for sugarcane at 0.1-0.2 m depth in \nHaplustox. The lack of compact layers was due to \nthe oxidic mineralogy of Eutrustox, which \npromoted the formation of very stable \nmicroaggregates (Dematt\u00ea, 1988), thus making the \nsoil resistant to compression. The greater soil bulk \ndensity in Eutrustox with cotton caused a decrease \nof the total porosity in all depths and the lowest \nmacroporosity at 0.1-0.4 m depth.  Total porosity \nin sugarcane and forested areas were not different, \nbut the pores diameter differed, causing a decrease \nin the macroporosity in the area cultivated with \n\nsugarcane. Therefore, the effect of the usage \nsystems on the soil structure was less of an \ninfluence on these soils. \nKaolinitic oxisol (Haplustox) showed the greatest \nbulk density and the smallest total porosity,   \nmacro and microporosity. Soil cultivation \nincreased the bulk density and decreased total \nporosity at 0.0-0.3 m depth with intensive effects \non Haplustox.

Assim, objetivou-se avaliar atributos \nf\u00edsicos de um Latossolo Vermelho Distr\u00f3fico, \ncaulin\u00edtico (LVd), e, de um Latossolo Vermelho \nEutrof\u00e9rrico, ox\u00eddico (LVef), sob diferentes \nsistemas de uso, localizados no munic\u00edpio de \nJaboticabal (SP), Brasil. Os sistemas de uso foram: \ncana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar; algod\u00e3o e mata. Foram avaliadas a \ndensidade do solo, porosidade total, macro e \nmicroporosidade, nas profundidades de 0,0-0,1, \n0,1-0,2, 0,2-0,3, 0,3-0,4 m. O Latossolo caulin\u00edtico \n(LVd) apresentou maior densidade do solo e \nmenor porosidade total, macro e microporosidade. \nO uso aumentou a densidade do solo na \nprofundidade de 0,0-0,3 m, com efeitos maiores no \nLatossolo caulin\u00edtico, principalmente na \nprofundidade de 0,1-0,2 m na \u00e1rea cultivada com \ncana-de-a\u00e7\u00facar.          \n \n \nREFERENCES \n \nBertol, I.
