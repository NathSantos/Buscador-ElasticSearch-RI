The demand of highly purified biomolecules \n\nhas triggered the development of new separation technologies. Herein, plasmid DNA (pDNA) \n\npurification process has been extensively investigated, in order to obtain highly purified \n\nmolecules for gene therapy applications and DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) vaccines. The \n\npurification of plasmid DNA is currently performed by different techniques, namely \n\nchromatography (anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, reversed phase, affinity and size-\n\nexclusion), enzymatic and membrane processes. Membrane technology is a broad and highly \n\ninterdisciplinary field, where process engineering, material science and chemistry meet to \n\nproduce membranes that have a wide range of applications, such as water, biomolecules and \n\nplasmid DNA purification. Furthermore, membrane systems take advantage of their selectivity, \n\nhigh surface-area-per-unit-volume. Herein, the main goal was to produce membrane systems - \n\nelectrospinning membranes: poly ?-caprolactone, polyethylene oxide and k-carrageenan; \n\nmodified-nylon membranes: nylon membrane impregnated with agarose - in order to perform \n\nmicrofiltration and ultrafiltration processes, respectively. The produced membranes were \n\ncharacterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier \n\nTransform Infrared Spectroscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy. The water contact angles \n\nwere also determined and the results obtained showed that the produced membranes presented \n\na hydrophilic character, which is in agreement with the date previously described in literature. \n\nPorosity studies were also performed and the results demonstrated that the electrospun \n\nmembranes have porosity around to 80% and the modified-nylon membranes have porosities of \n\napproximately 40%. These values can be considered to be very high, when comparing these \n\nmembranes to conventional microfiltration and ultrafiltration membranes produced by phase \n\ninversion. The plasmid DNA rejection was determined on the membranes produced and the \n\nexperimental results showed that the modified-nylon membrane presented rejection values up \n\nto 100%, depending on the imposed permeate flux, which is an attractive feature for its \n\napplication on plasmid DNA purification by ultrafiltration. In respect to the electrospun \n\nmembranes produced the observed rejections were found to be lower, up to 30%, which \n\ndemonstrates that this membranes need to be optimized or modified (post-synthesis \n\nmodification).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nx \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\n \n\nBiomolecules, electrospinning, membrane modification, microfiltration, plasmid DNA, \n\npurification, ultrafiltration. \n\n  \n\n\n\nxi \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxii \n\n \n\nResumo \n\n \n\nOs plasm\u00eddeos s\u00e3o entidades auto-replicantes que podem ser encontrados em todas as esp\u00e9cies \n\nde bact\u00e9rias e que t\u00eam um papel fundamental na adapta\u00e7\u00e3o e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das bact\u00e9rias. A \n\nnecessidade de obter biomol\u00e9culas com um elevado grau de pureza desencadeou o \n\ndesenvolvimento de novas t\u00e9cnicas de separa\u00e7\u00e3o. Os processos de optimiza\u00e7\u00e3o da purifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde ADN plasm\u00eddico t\u00eam sido estudados exaustivamente, para que estes possam ser usados em \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es de terapia g\u00e9nica ou em vacinas de ADN (\u00e1cido desoxirribonucleico). A purifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo ADN plasm\u00eddico tem sido realizada usando, nomeadamente a tecnologia de membranas. A \n\ntecnologia de membranas abrange uma vasta \u00e1rea do conhecimento, altamente \n\ninterdisciplinar, onde engenharia de processos, a ci\u00eancia dos materiais e a qu\u00edmica permitem \n\na produ\u00e7\u00e3o de membranas aplicadas em diferentes \u00e1reas, tais como purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1guas, \n\nbiomol\u00e9culas e de ADN plasm\u00eddico, entre muitas outras. Os sistemas de separa\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\nmembranas caracterizam-se por oferecer geralmente elevada selectividade nas separa\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\nelevadas \u00e1reas superficiais por unidade de volume do equipamento; e oferecem a possibilidade \n\nde controlar o n\u00edvel de contacto e/ou mistura entre duas fases. O presente estudo teve como \n\nobjectivo produzir membranas de micro e ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o para purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de ADN plasm\u00eddico - \n\nmembranas de electrospinning: poli ?-caprolactona, \u00f3xido de polietileno e k-carragenano; \n\nmembranas de nylon modificadas: membrana nylon impregnada com agarose. As membranas \n\nproduzidas foram caracterizadas por Microscopia Electr\u00f3nica de Varrimento, Espectroscopia de \n\nInfravermelho com Transformada de Fourier Atenuada e Espectroscopia de Raio X por Dispers\u00e3o \n\nde Energia. Os \u00e2ngulos de contacto com \u00e1gua tamb\u00e9m foram determinados e os resultados \n\nobtidos mostraram que as membranas produzidas apresentam caracter hidrof\u00edlico. Estudos de \n\nporosidade foram igualmente efectuados e os resultados demonstraram que as membranas \n\nproduzidas por electrospinning t\u00eam porosidades pr\u00f3ximas de 80% e a membrana de nylon \n\nmodificada tem uma porosidade pr\u00f3xima de 40%. Estes valores podem ser considerados bastante \n\nelevados, se os compararmos com valores t\u00edpicos de membranas de microfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o convencionais, produzidas por invers\u00e3o de fase. A rejei\u00e7\u00e3o de ADN plasm\u00eddico foi \n\ndeterminada para ambas as membranas. Os valores obtidos mostraram que a membrana de \n\nnylon modificada apresentou valores de rejei\u00e7\u00e3o at\u00e9 100%, dependendo do fluxo de permea\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nimposto, o que \u00e9 uma caracter\u00edstica promissora para a sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de ADN \n\nplasm\u00eddico por ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o. Relativamente \u00e0s membranas produzidas por electrospinning a \n\nrejei\u00e7\u00e3o foi menor, apenas at\u00e9 30%, o que demonstra que estas membranas precisam ser \n\noptimizadas ou eventualmente modificadas (modifica\u00e7\u00e3o por s\u00edntese). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nxiii \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave \n\n \n\nADN plasm\u00eddico, biomol\u00e9culas, electrospinning, microfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o, modifica\u00e7\u00e3o de membranas, \n\npurifica\u00e7\u00e3o, ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n  \n\n\n\nxiv \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nxv \n\n \n\nResumo Alargado \n\n \n\nOs plasm\u00eddeos s\u00e3o entidades auto-replicantes que podem ser encontrados em todas as esp\u00e9cies \n\nde bact\u00e9rias e que t\u00eam um papel fundamental na adapta\u00e7\u00e3o e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o das bact\u00e9rias. Al\u00e9m \n\ndisso, os plasm\u00eddeos s\u00e3o estudados devido \u00e0s suas propriedades intr\u00ednsecas, o que os torna \n\nimportantes ferramentas nos estudos de biologia molecular. Os processos de optimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nADN plasm\u00eddico t\u00eam sido estudados exaustivamente, para que estes possam ser usados em \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es de terapia g\u00e9nica ou em vacinas de ADN (\u00e1cido desoxirribonucleico). A necessidade \n\nde obter biomol\u00e9culas com um elevado grau de pureza desencadeou o desenvolvimento de \n\nnovas t\u00e9cnicas de separa\u00e7\u00e3o. A evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da terapia g\u00e9nica alcan\u00e7ou um importante marco \n\nhist\u00f3rico, nomeadamente, a autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o da EMA (European Medicines Agency) para a \n\ncomercializa\u00e7\u00e3o de um f\u00e1rmaco de terapia g\u00e9nica para o tratamento da defici\u00eancia da \n\nlipoprote\u00edna lipase. A purifica\u00e7\u00e3o do ADN plasm\u00eddico tem sido realizada usando v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas, \n\ntais como, cromatografia (troca i\u00f3nica, interac\u00e7\u00e3o hidrof\u00f3bica, fase reversa, afinidade e \n\nexclus\u00e3o molecular), enzim\u00e1tica e processos de membrana. Nos processos reportados na \n\nliteratura, os plasm\u00eddeos s\u00e3o produzidos por via fermentativa e subsequente processo de \n\npurifica\u00e7\u00e3o; este divide-se em tr\u00eas etapas: recupera\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria, recupera\u00e7\u00e3o intermedi\u00e1ria e \n\npurifica\u00e7\u00e3o final. A tecnologia de membranas abrange uma vasta \u00e1rea do conhecimento, \n\naltamente interdisciplinar, onde engenharia de processos, a ci\u00eancia dos materiais e a qu\u00edmica \n\npermitem a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de membranas aplicadas em diferentes \u00e1reas, tais como purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nADN plasm\u00eddico. Os sistemas de filtra\u00e7\u00e3o com membranas s\u00e3o apropriados para o processamento \n\nde mol\u00e9culas biol\u00f3gicas, uma vez que operam, relativamente, a baixas temperaturas e press\u00f5es \n\ne n\u00e3o envolvem mudan\u00e7as de fases, minimizando o grau de desnatura\u00e7\u00e3o, desactiva\u00e7\u00e3o e/ou \n\ndegrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos produtos biol\u00f3gicos; al\u00e9m disso, n\u00e3o requerem o consumo de grandes \n\nquantidades de agentes qu\u00edmicos, por se tratar de processos puramente f\u00edsicos. A filtra\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\nmembranas tem tamb\u00e9m normalmente baixos custos operat\u00f3rios comparando com outros \n\nprocessos alternativos. Al\u00e9m disso, a filtra\u00e7\u00e3o com membranas permite elevadas selectividades \n\ne elevada produtividade, sendo os sistemas bastante compactos, dada a elevada \u00e1rea \n\nsuperficial por unidade de volume dos m\u00f3dulos industriais. Os processos de filtra\u00e7\u00e3o com \n\nmembranas podem ser classificados tendo em conta diferentes caracter\u00edsticas das membranas, \n\nnomeadamente o tamanho do poro, tamanho e carga das part\u00edculas ou mol\u00e9culas retidas e a \n\npress\u00e3o exercida na membrana. Esta classifica\u00e7\u00e3o permite distinguir as membranas de \n\nmicrofiltra\u00e7\u00e3o, ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o, nanofiltra\u00e7\u00e3o e osmose reversa. No caso da microfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o a separa\u00e7\u00e3o molecular \u00e9 baseada essencialmente nas diferen\u00e7as de tamanho das \n\nmol\u00e9culas, forma e diferen\u00e7as de flexibilidade estrutural. O electrospinning \u00e9 um m\u00e9todo f\u00e1cil \n\ne barato de produzir materiais nanofibrosos. A simplicidade deste processo e a vasta gama de \n\naplica\u00e7\u00f5es encontrada, incluindo engenharia de tecidos, sensores e biossensores e filtra\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o \n\nimportantes factores que levam a um interesse progressivo no desenvolvimento de novos tipos \n\n\n\nxvi \n\n \n\nde membranas nanofibrosas produzidas por electrospinning. Este tipo de membranas oferece \n\num conjunto de vantagens na filtra\u00e7\u00e3o, principalmente pela elevada porosidade das membranas \n\n(tipicamente \u00e0 volta de 80%) e a elevada raz\u00e3o de \u00e1rea de superf\u00edcie/volume (devido \u00e0 elevada \n\n\u00e1rea superficial das fibras), quando comparados com membranas polim\u00e9ricas convencionais \n\nobtidas por invers\u00e3o de fase e membranas cer\u00e2micas. A elevada porosidade pode melhorar \n\ndirectamente o fluxo sem prejudicar a taxa de rejei\u00e7\u00e3o dos contaminantes e a elevada raz\u00e3o \n\n\u00e1rea/volume permite tirar partido de poss\u00edveis interac\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsicas soluto/membrana que \n\npossam ser \u00fateis nas separa\u00e7\u00f5es e/ou no controlo da colmata\u00e7\u00e3o. Actualmente existem v\u00e1rias \n\nmembranas de ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edveis no mercado que podem ser usadas para a purifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde ADN plasm\u00eddico. Tendo em conta o tamanho das mol\u00e9culas do ADN plasm\u00eddico, a modifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda superf\u00edcie de membranas de microfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o aparece como uma poss\u00edvel alternativa, \n\noferecendo a possibilidade de ajustar a selectividade desejada a um caso particular. V\u00e1rios \n\nestudos t\u00eam demonstrado que as propriedades da membrana, tais como resist\u00eancia \u00e0s \n\nprote\u00ednas, biocompatibilidade, carga e hidrofobicidade, podem ser melhoradas atrav\u00e9s de \n\nprocessos de modifica\u00e7\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie. No presente estudo pretendeu-se produzir membranas \n\nde microfiltra\u00e7\u00e3o e de ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o para purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de ADN plasm\u00eddico - membranas \n\nproduzidas por electrospinning: poli ?-caprolactona, \u00f3xido de polietileno e k-carragenano; \n\nmembranas de nylon modificadas: membranas de nylon impregnadas com agarose. As \n\nmembranas produzidas foram caracterizadas por Microscopia Electr\u00f3nica de Varrimento, \n\nEspectroscopia de Infravermelho com Transformada de Fourier Atenuada, Espectroscopia de \n\nRaio X por Dispers\u00e3o de Energia. Os \u00e2ngulos de contacto com \u00e1gua tamb\u00e9m foram determinados \n\ne os resultados obtidos mostraram que as membranas produzidas apresentavam caracter \n\nhidrof\u00edlico. Estudos de porosidade foram igualmente efectuados e os resultados demonstraram \n\nque as membranas produzidas por electrospinning t\u00eam porosidades pr\u00f3ximas de 80% e a \n\nmembrana de nylon modificada tem uma porosidade pr\u00f3xima de 40%. Estes valores podem ser \n\nconsiderados bastante elevados, se os compararmos com valores t\u00edpicos de membranas de \n\nmicrofiltra\u00e7\u00e3o e ultrafiltra\u00e7\u00e3o convencionais, produzidas por invers\u00e3o de fase. A rejei\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nADN plasm\u00eddico foi determinada para ambas as membranas.

Introduction \n\n \n\n1.1 Plasmid DNA \n\nPlasmids are autonomously replicating entities which can be found essentially in all bacterial \n\nspecies and that play a significant role in bacterial adaptation and evolution [1]. Like \n\nchromosomes, plasmids code for ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules and proteins, replicate as \n\ncell grows and equal numbers are normally distributed to the two daughter cells upon cell \n\ndivision [1]. Plasmids are studied due to their intrinsic properties and serve as important tools \n\nin molecular biology studies [1], for instance, they have been used as vectors for gene therapy \n\nor vaccination in the last two decades [2-4]. The injection of plasmid DNA (pDNA) containing \n\nselected genes from pathogens can induce a protective immune response [5]. In previous studies \n\nit has been demonstrated that pDNA vaccines can simulate intracellular pathogen gene \n\nexpression pathways, but are quiet safe due to a lack genetic integration, i.e. the injected \n\nforeign genetic material will not be integrated in the host genetic material and, therefore, it \n\nwill not be responsible for an immune response in the host [6, 7]. \n\nThe demand of highly purified biomolecules has triggered the development of new separation \n\ntechnologies. Herein, the plasmid DNA purification has been extensively investigated, in order \n\nto obtain a highly purified molecules for gene therapy applications and deoxyribonucleic acid \n\n(DNA) vaccines [8]. The evolution of gene therapy achieved an important landmark, namely, \n\nthe authorization of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the commercialisation, in the \n\nEuropean Union, of Glybera (alipogene tiparvovec) for gene therapy, to treat the lipoprotein \n\nlipase deficiency [9]. In literature there are different studies focused on this topic [1, 9-11] and \n\nthe formulation of DNA vaccines [12-14] has the encouraging results shown in autoimmune \n\ndiseases such as AIDS, and due to the other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis B and C, and \n\ntuberculosis [6, 7]. \n\n \n\n1.1.2 Purification methods \n\nThe final pDNA solution must strictly obey to the safety regulations imposed by the Food and \n\nDrug Administration (FDA) and/or EMA, known as Good Manufacture Products (GMP) [6]. They \n\nestablish thresholds for the presence of contaminants, including harmful chemicals (cesium \n\nchloride, ethidium bromide, isopropanol, phenol or chloroform) and enzymes (RNase A, \n\nlysozyme and proteinase K), which are used in laboratory protocols and are considered unsafe \n\nor impractical, when inserted into large scale operations [15-18]. \n\nThe purification of pDNA has been achieved through the use of different techniques, including \n\nchromatography (anion-exchange, hydrophobic interaction, reversed phase, affinity and size-\n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n3 \n\n \n\nexclusion), enzymatic and membrane processes [19-23]. Figure 1 shows a scheme of pDNA \n\npurification process adapted from Prazeres et al [19], in which the authors refer the main steps \n\nof pDNA purification process, from cell lysis to the final product purification and formulation, \n\ndividing it into three stages: primary recovery, intermediate recovery and final purification. It \n\nalso can be seen in Figure 1 that microfiltration (MF) and ultrafiltration (UF) can be used in \n\nmost of the different phases of the process. \n\nPrimary recovery essentially consists in cell harvesting, cell disruption and the removal of cell \n\ndebris from the main stream. In the intermediate recovery a more thorough purification is \n\nperformed, removing genomic DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins and concentrating the pDNA. \n\nThe final purification is the most important step, because it leads to a pure pDNA, free of \n\ncontaminants; in this step the remains of genomic DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins, undesirable \n\nplasmid isoforms, salts and process contaminants are removed. All this steps are resumed in \n\nFigure 1. \n\nOn a large scale, it is of paramount importance to develop a set of highly efficient processes, \n\nsince the conventional laboratory pDNA purification procedures, as already described, are quite \n\ncomplex to scale up and involve the use of chemicals that are forbidden by regulatory agencies \n\n[19]. Hereupon, purification processes that use membranes were found as a good solution for \n\npurify pDNA in larger scale, since they avoid the use of dangerous chemicals [15, 20, 23]. \n\nFurthermore, MF and UF membranes avoid precipitation solvents and centrifugation steps. \n\nHowever, the pDNA purification from RNA by ultrafiltration remains a challenge as recently has \n\nbeen published in the literature [15, 23]. \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n4 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Representation of the downstream process used for the production of purified pDNA (adapted \nfrom [19]). \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n5 \n\n \n\n1.2 Membrane technology \n\nMembrane technology is a broad and highly interdisciplinary field, where process engineering, \n\nmaterial science and chemistry meet to produce membranes that have a wide range of \n\napplications [24]. Membrane filtration usually operates under mild conditions and does not \n\nrequire the addition of chemicals to be performed, thus making it generally well-suitable for \n\nprocessing of biotechnology products. Membrane filtration also has lower operation costs than \n\nalternative processes like chromatography and precipitation [25], and a reduced environmental \n\nimpact. Moreover, they possess characteristics that enable a linear scale-up of the process and \n\nallow its easy automation. Membrane filtration processes can be also designed for operating in \n\ncontinuous mode [26-28]. \n\nMembrane filtration systems take advantage of their high selectivity and high surface-area-per-\n\nunit-volume [29]. They are suitable for processing biological molecules since they operate at \n\nrelatively low temperatures and pressures and involve no phase changes or chemical additives, \n\nthereby minimizing the extent of denaturation, deactivation, and/or degradation of biological \n\nproducts [29]. Membrane processes usually achieve high efficiency in terms of separation, \n\nwhich has a great economic impact [30]. \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Membrane classification \n\nMembrane processes can be sorted by several criteria, distinguishing microfiltration from \n\nultrafiltration, nanofiltration and from reverse osmosis. Those criteria are: the characteristics \n\nof the membrane (pore size), size and charge of the retained particles or molecules, and \n\npressure exerted on the membrane [31, 32]. In membrane filtration the driving force for the \n\nseparation is a pressure gradient which is imposed through the semi-permeable membrane. \n\nSuspended solids or solutes are retained in the so-called retentate, while water and non-\n\nretained solutes pass through the membrane in the permeate [31, 32]. \n\nMicrofiltration (MF) membranes have the largest pores (0.1 \u00b5m to 10 \u00b5m) and the highest \n\nhydraulic permeability. These values corresponds to the typical size of suspended solids, \n\ncolloids and bacteria; however, MF membranes can only be used as a disinfection barrier if \n\nactions are taken against bacterial regrowth [31-33]. \n\nUltrafiltration (UF) membranes have smaller pores (2 to 100 nm) and the hydraulic permeability \n\nis considerably lower than in MF. A typical application for these membranes is to retain \n\ndissolved macromolecules like the largest molecules of the natural organic material [31, 32, \n\n34]. \n\nNanofiltration (NF) is a membrane filtration process used most often with low total dissolved \n\nsolids in water such as surface water and fresh groundwater, with the purpose of softening \n\n(polyvalent cation removal) and removal of infection by product precursors such as natural \n\norganic matter and synthetic organic matter. In nanofiltration the pore sizes are smaller than \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n6 \n\n \n\nin UF, typically around 1 nm, this makes NF suitable for the removal of relatively small organics, \n\ni.e. organic micro pollutants and colour from surface water or groundwater and degradation \n\nproducts from effluent of biologically treated wastewater. Furthermore, NF membranes can \n\nalso have a surface charge that allows the removal of ions with a size below the pore size of \n\nthe membrane [31, 32, 35]. \n\nReverse osmosis (RO) is a water purification technology that also uses homogeneous (i.e., non-\n\nporous) semipermeable membranes. The applied pressure is used to overcome the osmotic \n\npressure. Rejection is not just a result of filtering, but solution-diffusion mechanisms will \n\ndetermine the permeation of the dissolved species. The low hydraulic permeability of reverse \n\nosmosis membrane requires high pressures and, consequently, relatively high energy \n\nconsumption. This effect is even more pronounced in the presence of an osmotic pressure due \n\nto high concentrations of dissolved components that counteract the effect of the exerted \n\npressure [31, 32, 36]. \n\nThe characteristics of all these processes and membranes are summarized in Table 1 and Figure \n\n2 and 3. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n7 \n\n \n\nTable 1 Overview of membrane processes and their characteristics ([31]). \n\n Microfiltration Ultrafiltration Nanofiltration Reverse Osmosis \n\nHydraulic \n\nPermeability \n\n(L/h.m2.bar) \n\n> 1000 10 \u2013 1000 1.5 - 30 0.05 \u2013 1.5 \n\nPressure (bar) 0.1 - 2 0.1 \u2013 5 3 - 20 5 \u2013 120 \n\nPore size (nm) 100 - 10000 2 \u2013 100 0.5 - 2 &lt;0.5 \n\nRejection Particles \n\nMultivalent ions, \n\nmacromolecules, \n\nparticles \n\nMultivalent \n\nions, Small \n\norganic \n\ncompounds, \n\nMacromolecule\n\ns, particles \n\nMonovalent ions, \n\nmultivalent ions, \n\nSmall organic \n\ncompounds, \n\nMacromolecules, \n\nparticles \n\nSeparation \n\nmechanism \nFiltration Filtration \n\nFiltration, \n\ncharge effects \nSolution-diffusion \n\nApplications \n\nClarification, \n\npre-treatment, \n\nremoval of \n\nbacteria \n\nRemoval of \n\nmacromolecules, \n\nbacteria, viruses \n\nRemoval of \n\nmultivalent \n\nions, relatively \n\nsmall organics \n\nUltrapure water, \n\ndesalination \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n8 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 Pressure-driven membrane process spectrum (adapted from [37]). \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n9 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 Membrane process characteristics: microfiltration, ultrafiltration, nanofiltration and RO \ndistinguished (adapted from [38]). \n\n \n\n1.2.2 Membranes applications \n\nMembrane technology can be used in a large number of applications such as solid-liquid \n\nseparation, concentration, buffer exchange, purification and sterilization [25, 27, 39]. \n\nMembrane technology not only has been extensively used for several applications in \n\ndownstream processes, but in upstream processes too, which leads to a demanding role in the \n\npurification of biotechnology products [19, 29]. Furthermore, membrane processes are also \n\nused for water purification [27, 37], nucleic acids (pDNA and RNA) recovery and purification \n\n[15, 20] and gas\u2013liquid contacting and emulsification [24].

When the transport direction is out of a system it is called separation; when it is into \n\nthe system it is called membrane contacting. The cause of transport through a membrane is a \n\ndifference in chemical potential between both sides. This difference may be due to a gradient \n\nin temperature, pressure, concentration or electrical potential [24]. The mechanisms for \n\ntransport strongly depend on membrane morphology. Two typical morphologies can be \n\ndistinguished: porous and dense (homogeneous). Dense membranes are permeable for single \n\nmolecules and have two major characteristics: transport by solution-diffusion model and \n\nintrinsic selectivity. Solution-diffusion transport is the concentration gradient diffusivity, i.e., \n\ntransport occurs only by diffusion, and can explain dialysis, reverse osmosis, gas permeation \n\nand pervaporation, and it is clearly material dependent. The component that needs to be \n\ntransported must first be dissolved in the membrane. In solution-diffusion model it is assumed \n\nthat the chemical potential of the feed and permeate fluids are in equilibrium with the adjacent \n\nmembrane surfaces such that appropriate expressions for the chemical potential in the fluid \n\nand membrane phases can be equated at the solution-membrane interface [24, 40]. Intrinsic \n\nselectivity is the indication of the membrane separation efficiency and in combination with the \n\nhydraulic permeability it indicates the general performance of the membrane [24]. \n\nIn porous membranes the transport mechanism is completely different. Transport occurs \n\nthrough the empty spaces (pores) of the membrane. However, the interaction with the internal \n\nmembrane surface can play a crucial role. In respect to membrane morphology the surface and \n\nvolume porosity, pore size distribution and tortuosity are important parameters for its \n\nperformance. Tortuosity is a factor used to correct the deviation of pore shape from perfect \n\ncylinders. It is defined by the ratio of the average path length through the pores and the \n\nmembrane thickness. The pore sizes range goes from micrometers to below 1 nm and the \n\nporosities range goes from more than 80% for micrometer-sized pores to less than 2% for \n\nnanometer-sized pores. An important property of membranes used in pressure-driven \n\ntechniques is the hydraulic permeability, Lp, which is the ratio of the observed permeate flux \n\nto the imposed pressure. Both the porosity, the pore size and the membrane tortuosity affect \n\nthe value of the observed Lp. Lp is also dependent on the viscosity of the permeate and therefore \n\nis temperature dependent. In respect to ultrafiltration membranes, another important property \n\nis the molecular weight cut-off, which indicates the molecular weight of the macromolecules \n\n90% retained by the membrane; this gives an approximate indication of the pore size. In respect \n\nto the retentive properties of membranes it is also important to define the concepts of sieving \n\ncoefficient and rejection. The sieving coefficient of a certain solute or particle relates the \n\nconcentration of component in permeate to that in the feed. The rejection is defined as one \n\nminus the sieving coefficient [24]. \n\nMembranes can be operated in two modes (Figure 4): \u201cdead-end\u201d mode and \u201ccross-flow\u201d mode. \n\nIn the dead-end mode a solution contained in a reservoir is transported towards the membrane. \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n12 \n\n \n\nThe components rejected by the membrane will accumulate at the membrane surface and \n\neventually will diffuse back to the bulk of the solution in the reservoir. On the other hand, in \n\ncross-flow mode, the feed flows parallel to the membrane surface. In both cases the stream \n\nthat passes through membrane is called \u201cpermeate\u201d, while the remainder is defined as \n\n\u201cretentate\u201d. Therefore, in a cross-flow system the permeate stream flows perpendicular to the \n\nfeed stream but in a dead-end system the permeate flows in the direction of the feed [24]. \n\n \n\nFigure 4 Comparison between a (a) dead-ended filtration and a (b) cross-flow filtration (adapted from \n[29]). \n\n \n\n1.2.4 Factors that affect the filtration process \n\nIn the filtration process, there are certain factors that affect the filtration, these factors are, \n\nmainly membrane selectivity, the flux and the system capacity [27]. \n\nThe selectivity of the membrane is determined by the pore size distribution and the membrane \n\nsurface properties, i.e., highly selective ultrafiltration membranes can be developed using \n\nelectrically charged membranes that have very high retention of macromolecules with the same \n\npolarity and similarly. By turn, adsorptive membranes can provide highly selective separations \n\nbased on the specific binding of several components on the surface of the membrane [41, 42]. \n\nThe selectivity is directly related to the solute filtering coefficient: \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n13 \n\n \n\n? =\n??\n\n??\n \n\nwhere Cf is permeate solution and CF is the feed solution [27]. \n\nThe flux is evaluated using the actual feedstock of interest, being typically less than the value \n\npredicted from the clean membrane permeability, due to fouling and concentration \n\npolarization effects [43]. The pure water flux is related to the membrane hydraulic \n\npermeability: \n\n?? =\n??\n??\n\n \n\nwhere Jv is the flux (volumetric flow rate per unit membrane area) and ?P is the transmembrane \n\npressure difference [27]. The membrane fouling can arise from adsorption on and within the \n\nmembrane pores and/or from the formation of a deposit on the external surface of the \n\nmembrane (Figure 5). Concentration polarization refers to the accumulation of completely or \n\npartially retained solutes at the upstream surface of the membrane due to bulk mass transfer \n\nlimitations of the membrane. The dominant effect in protein ultrafiltration is the reduction in \n\nthe effective pressure driving force due to osmotic pressure effects [27]. The extent of the \n\nconcentration polarization can be controlled by adjusting the fluid flow characteristics, \n\ntypically by providing high local shear rates in cross-flow filtration modules or by stirring the \n\nfeed in \u201cdead-end\u201d filtration [44, 45]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 Membrane fouling can occur due to adsorption within the membrane pores (a), adsorption on \nthe membrane surface (b) or by both of them (c) (adapted from [46]). \n\n \n\nThe system capacity is defined as the volume of feed that can be processed per unit membrane \n\narea, before the membrane needs to be regenerated or replaced. For membrane processes \n\n(1) \n\n(2) \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n14 \n\n \n\noperated at a constant transmembrane pressure, the capacity is typically defined as the point \n\nat which the filtrate flow rate has dropped to less than 10% of its initial value or below a pre-\n\ndetermined flux that is required for a particular application. For operation at constant filtrate \n\nflux, the capacity is defined by the maximum pressure drop that can be tolerated by the system, \n\nand can be limited by the membrane. The adsorptive membrane capacity is defined by the \n\nappearance of an unacceptable level of a key component in the flow-through stream (referred \n\nto as breakthrough). Breakthrough is determined by both the equilibrium (static) binding \n\nproperties of the membrane in combination with any mass transfer limitations in the device. \n\nThe capacity of depth filters can be determined by either the breakthrough of a key component \n\nor by an unacceptable pressure drop [27]. \n\n \n\n1.3 Nanofibrous membranes \n\nElectrospinning is an easy and cheap method of producing nanofibres [21]. The simplicity of \n\nthis procedure and the wide range of applications found in recent years, including tissue \n\nengineering applications, such as bone repair, wound healing and drug delivery [47-49], sensors \n\nand biosensors production [50], polymeric conductive membranes1 development [51] and \n\nfiltration2 [52-54]. Such variety of applications leads to an increased interest in developing new \n\ntypes of electrospun nanofibre membranes [55]. \n\nThe electrospinning apparatus consists in three basic components (Figure 6): a needle attached \n\nto a syringe filled with a polymer solution; a grounded collector plate; a high voltage power \n\nsupply, connected between the capillary and the collector; and a syringe pump that is usually \n\nused to control the feeding rate of the polymer solution. A charged polymer solution flowing \n\nout of the needle is accelerated towards the grounded collector through the application of a \n\nstrong electrostatic field [55, 56]. This electromagnetic field causes the droplet to emerge from \n\nthe needle to undergo deformation into a conical shape, known as the \u201cTaylor cone\u201d (Figure 7) \n\n[57]. When a critical value is attained (the repulsive electrostatic force overcomes the surface \n\ntension) a fine jet of the solution emerges from the \u201cTaylor cone\u201d. The jet undergoes twisting \n\ninstability and a characteristic whipping motion due to the charge-charge repulsion that occurs \n\nbetween the excess charges presented in the jet (Figure 6). During this phase, the jet is drawn \n\nby at least two orders of magnitude, the solvent evaporates and the dry fibres deposit onto the \n\ncollector [56, 58-60]. A polymer melt, instead of a polymer-solvent solution, can also be used \n\nby a heating system that surrounds the reservoir and maintains the temperature [56, 61]. \n\n \n\n                                                 \n1 Applied as electrostatic dissipation, corrosion protection, electromagnetic interference shielding, \nphotovoltaic device, fabrication of tiny electronic devices. \n2 Used in air filtration applications for more than a decade, and currently in solid-liquid filtration. \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n15 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 Representation of the electrospinning apparatus (adapted from [56]). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7 Image representing the Taylor cone (adapted from [56]). \n\n \n\n1.3.1 Parameters that influence the production of nanofibrous \n\nThe fibre structure is affected by different factors such as the density of chain entanglements, \n\nsolution conductivity, solution viscosity, strength of applied field, polymer feed rate, needle \n\nsize and diameter, and the distance between the needle and the collector. Moreover, the \n\nsurrounding conditions such as temperature, humidity and air velocity also affect the \n\nmorphology of the fibres. \n\nThe density of chain entanglements, as shown in Figure 8, is an important parameter since it \n\nprevents the occurrence of the phenomena known as Rayleigh instability, and is related to the \n\nsolution viscosity (directly controlled by the molecular weight of the polymer and the solution \n\nconcentration). The chain entanglements prevent the jet to break up and, therefore, the \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n16 \n\n \n\nRayleigh instability3 [62] does not occur, which result into a continuous fibre formation. If the \n\ndensity of chain entanglements in a given solution is less than a critical value, the jet breaks \n\nup due to insufficient resistance to the electrostatic field [63-65]. If the entanglements in the \n\nchains are present but the amount of the chain superposition is below the critical value, then \n\nRayleigh instability is not completely eliminated, leading to the formation of fibres with beaded \n\nmorphologies [64, 65]. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 Illustration of polymer chain entanglement: (a) isolated polymer chains, (b) entangled polymer \nchains (adapted from [56]). \n\n \n\nAn increase in the solution viscosity, beyond necessary minimum, increases the visco-elastic \n\nforce which opposes coulombic force and therefore leads to an increase in fibre size. An \n\nincrease in the strength of the field and/or conductivity of the polymer solution could be \n\nexpected to lead to a decrease in fibre size [55, 56]. \n\nOther parameter that affects electrospinning process and fibre morphology is the solution \n\nconductivity. Fluids with high conductivity have high surface charge density, and under the \n\ninfluence of an electric field, suffer an elongation force on the jet, which is caused by the self-\n\nrepulsion of the excess charges at their surface. This inhibits the Rayleigh instability, enhances \n\nwhipping, and leads to the formation of thin fibres [63, 66, 67]. \n\nA higher feeding rate of the polymer solution and/or larger size of the needle diameter \n\nincreases the fibre size, and a larger distance between needle tip and collector plate decreases \n\nfibre size. These effects are not linear and do not necessarily mean that the quality of the \n\nproduct is maintained but they give a general idea about the trends [55]. For each polymer \n\ntype and solvent system, there is usually a relatively narrow set of manufacturing conditions \n\nthat provide optimal results [55, 56]. \n\nAt last another parameter affecting the fibre morphology is the interactions between the \n\npolymer and the solvent, where the molecular weight of the polymer does affect the process. \n\nIf certain physical properties are required for the polymer solution, it is very important to select \n\n                                                 \n3Explains why and how a falling stream of fluid breaks up into smaller packets with the same volume but \nless surface area. \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n17 \n\n \n\nthe right solvent or combination of the appropriate solvents, since the first and key step in the \n\nelectrospinning process is the polymer dissolution in a suitable solvent [55]. The dielectric \n\nconstant (table 3) and the boiling temperature of the solvent are absolutely decisive when \n\nselecting the correct one to produce nanofibrous. Solvents with a low dielectric constant will \n\nimprove the dissolution of the polymer charged chains by dispersing the ion pairs, enhancing \n\nthe conductivity and, therefore, reducing the need of applying extreme voltages [56]. \n\nFurthermore, solvents with low boiling point will evaporate faster from the polymer surface, \n\nupon fibre formation [55, 56]. \n\n \n\nTable 3 Properties of different solvents used in electrospinning process ([55]). \n\nSolvent \nSurface tension \n\n(nM/m) \nDielectric constant Boiling point (\u00baC) \n\nChloroform 26.5 4.8 61.6 \n\nDimethyl formamide 37.1 38.3 153 \n\nHexafluoro isopropanol 16.1 16.70 58.2 \n\nTetrahydrofuran 26.4 7.5 66 \n\nTrifluoro ethanol 21.1 27 78 \n\nAcetone 25.20 21 56.1 \n\nWater 72.8 80 100 \n\nMethanol 22.3 33 64.5 \n\nAcetic acid 26.9 6.2 118.1 \n\nFormic acid 37 58 100 \n\nDichloro methane 27.2 9.1 40 \n\nEthanol 21.9 24 78.3 \n\nTrifluoro acetic acid 13.5 8.4 72.4 \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n18 \n\n \n\n1.3.2 Polymeric Nanofibrous \n\nThe ability of reducing the diameter of polymeric fibre materials from micrometers to \n\nnanometers enables several remarkable features, such as very large surface area to volume \n\nratio, versatility of the nanofibrous surface functionalization and superior mechanical \n\nperformance (e.g. stiffness and tensile strength) that allow the production of fibres with a wide \n\nvariety of sizes and shapes [68]. \n\nThe morphological, chemical and mechanical characterization of the nanofibrous is usually \n\nperformed. The fibre diameter, distribution, orientation and morphology (i.e. cross-section \n\nshape and surface roughness) are usually characterized by scanning electron microscopy, field \n\nemission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force \n\nmicroscopy [55, 69-74]. The characterization of the molecular structure (chemical \n\ncharacterization) of a nanofibre can be performed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy \n\nand nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. If two polymers are blended together for the \n\nfabrication of nanofibrous, not only the structure of the two materials can be detected but the \n\nintermolecular interaction can be determined by the use of these methods; the characteristic \n\npeaks from each component of the membrane must be found in the spectra of the final product \n\n[55, 75]. The mechanical characterization, which consists in the precise measurement of \n\nmechanical properties of the nanofibrous matrix, is crucial especially for biomedical \n\napplications. For example, for nanofibrous acting as scaffolds, they must be able to withstand \n\nthe forces exerted by the growing tissue or during physiological activities and related \n\nbiomechanics and therefore, their mechanical characterization should be performed. The \n\nmechanical characterization is achieved by applying tensile test loads to specimens prepared \n\nfrom the electrospun ultrafine non-woven fibre mats. The tensile tests consist in stretching the \n\nmembrane to the point of rupture and analyse its resistance. During the mechanical \n\ncharacterization of single nanofibrous, sufficient care must be taken in sample mounting in \n\norder to avoid severe damage or sample manipulation [55, 76, 77]. \n\nElectrospun fibres can be applied in different areas, such as filtration, wound healing, affinity \n\nmembrane, protective clothing, energy generation, enzyme immobilization, drug delivery, \n\ntissue engineering and biosensors (Figure 9) [78, 79]. For filtration, the channels and structural \n\nelements of a filter must be matched to the scale of the particles or droplets that will be \n\ncaptured in the filter. Thus, we can take advantage of the unique properties of electrospun \n\nmembranes consisting of very-small-diameter fibres [55]. \n\nIn wound healing, an ideal dressing should have certain characteristics such as haemostatic \n\nability, efficiency as bacterial barrier, absorption aptitude of excess exudates (wound \n\nfluid/pus), appropriate water vapour transmission rate, adequate gaseous exchange capability, \n\ncapacity to conform to the contour of the wound area, functional adhesion (i.e., adherent to \n\nhealthy tissue but non-adherent to wound tissue) painless to patient and ease of removal, and \n\nfinally have a low cost [55, 80]. \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n19 \n\n \n\nAffinity membranes are a broad class of membranes that selectively capture specific target \n\nmolecules (or ligands) by immobilizing a specific ligand onto the membrane surface. They \n\nreflect technological advances in both fixed-bed liquid chromatography and membrane \n\nfiltration, and combine both the outstanding selectivity of the chromatography resins and the \n\nreduced pressure associated to filtration membranes [55, 81, 82]. \n\nElectrospun nanofibre membranes have been recognized as potential candidates for protective \n\nclothing applications, because of their low weight, large surface area, high porosity (breathable \n\nnature), great filtration efficiency, resistance to penetration of harmful chemical agents in \n\naerosol form and their ability to neutralize the chemical agents without impedance of the air \n\nand water vapour permeability to the clothing. Protective clothing should have some essential \n\nproperties, ensured by the nanofibrous, such as low weight, breathable fabric, air and water \n\nvapour permeability, insolubility in all solvents and enhanced toxic chemical resistance [55, \n\n83, 84]. \n\nPolymeric conductive membranes also have the potential to be applied for electrostatic \n\ndissipation, corrosion protection, electromagnetic interference shielding, photovoltaic devices \n\nand fabrication of tiny electronic devices or machines such as Schottky junctions, sensors and \n\nactuators etc., as the rate of electrochemical reactions is proportional to the surface area of \n\nthe electrode [55, 85, 86]. \n\nImmobilization of enzymes on inert insoluble materials is an active area of research for \n\nimproving the functionality and performance of enzymes for bioprocessing applications since \n\nthe immobilized enzymes offer several advantages such as reusability, better control reaction \n\nand are more stable than soluble ones. The performance of immobilized enzymes depends \n\ngreatly on the characteristics and structure of the carrier materials and the modification of the \n\ncarriers, such as rendering biocompatibility, hydrophilicity, etc. [87]. The fine porous structure \n\nof electrospun fibres membranes can effectively relieve the diffusion resistance of the \n\nsubstrates/products and can greatly increase the catalysing ability of the immobilized enzymes \n\ndue to the large specific surface area [55, 88, 89]. \n\nControlled drug release at a defined rate over a definite period of time is possible with \n\nbiocompatible delivery matrices of polymers, biodegradable polymers are therefore mostly \n\nused as drug delivery systems to deliver therapeutic agents because they can be easily designed \n\nfor programmed dissemination in a controlled fashion [55, 90]. Nanofibre mats have been \n\napplied as drug carriers in drug delivery systems because of their high functional characteristics \n\nand because drug delivery system that rely on the principle that the dissolution rate of a \n\nparticulate drug increases with the increase of the surface of the drug. Also, the large surface \n\narea associated with nanospun fabrics allows fast and efficient solvent evaporation, that \n\nprovides the incorporated drug limited time to recrystallize which favours the formation of \n\namorphous dispersions or solid solutions [55, 91]. \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n20 \n\n \n\nFor engineered living tissues, a biodegradable scaffold is generally considered as an \n\nindispensable element. Nanofibres are used as temporary templates for cell adhesion, \n\nproliferation and differentiation in order to repair and restore the damaged tissue, i.e., to \n\nreproduce the native extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. There has been an increased rush \n\nin the use of electrospinning techniques to create nanofibrous scaffolds for tissue engineering \n\ndue to the reports that indicate that these scaffolds positively promote cell\u2013matrix and cell\u2013\n\ncell interactions with the cells having a normal phenotypic shape and gene expression [55, 92]. \n\nFinally, biosensors, which typically consist of a bio-functional membrane and a transducer, have \n\nbeen widely used for environmental, food, and clinical purposes. There are many parameters \n\nthat affect the performance of a sensor which includes sensitivity, selectivity, response time, \n\nreproducibility and aging, all of which are dependent directly on the property of the sensing \n\nmembrane used. Since there is a strong need for detection of gases and biological substances \n\nwhen they are present in low concentrations, sensitivity plays a very critical role. Modern \n\nbiomedical sensors with advanced micro fabrication and signal-processing techniques are \n\nbecoming more and more accurate and inexpensive nowadays [55, 93]. Electrospun nanofibrous \n\nmembranes have received great attention for applications as sensors because of their unique \n\nlarge surface area which is the most desirable property for improving the sensitivity of \n\nconductimetric sensors, a larger surface area will absorb more gas analyte and change the \n\nsensor's conductivity more significantly. Silk fibroin membranes-based biosensors have been \n\nextensively used for analysing various substances such as glucose, hydrogen peroxide and uric \n\nacid [55, 94, 95]. \n\nIn this work, a poly ?-caprolactone support was prepared by a conventional electrospinning \n\nprocess. This polymer was selected based on the good mechanical properties that PCL meshes \n\npresent [21, 96] and also for being environmentally friendly [21, 97]. A coating based on an \n\nelectrospun mixture of two polymers, k-carrageenan and polyethylene oxide (PEO), was \n\ndeposited on the PCL support. k-carrageenan was selected for Electrospun Nanofibre \n\nMembranes (ENMs) coating due to its high hydrophilicity, relatively low cost, the ability of \n\nproducing small diameter fibres by electrospinning, when mixed with PEO, and due to their \n\nsulphate groups [21, 98, 99]. This asymmetric arrangement of two different layers provides the \n\nmembrane with suitable mechanical robustness whereas separation selectiveness is regulated \n\npredominantly by the ultrathin layer of nanofibres [21]. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 9 Scheme of the applications of electrospun nanofibres in different sectors. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n22 \n\n \n\n1.3.3 Application of nanofibrous membranes on separation processes \n\nElectrospun nanofibrous membrane have successfully been developed and used for the \n\nproduction of high-performance air filters. The filtration efficiency, which is closely associated \n\nwith fibre thickness, is one of the most important concerns for filter performance. Generally, \n\nwhen filter efficiency increases linearly with the decrease of the thickness of the membrane \n\nfilter and the applied pressure increases. The enhanced filtration efficiency at the same \n\npressure drop is possible with fibres having diameters less than 0.5 \u00b5m [55, 100]. Electrospun \n\nmembranes offer a wide set of advantages for filtration applications, such as higher porosity \n\n(typically around 80%), higher surface area to volume ratio and high surface cohesion (which \n\nfacilitates particle entrapment and, therefore, improves the filtration efficiency), lower base \n\nweight, and continuously interconnected pores, when compared to conventional polymer and \n\nceramic membranes. These attributes can directly improve the flux performance without \n\nsacrificing the contaminant rejection ratio [101, 102]. The consistent production of very small \n\ndiameter fibres enables the removal of unwanted particles at the submicron scale, which is \n\nclearly an advantage of the electrospinning membranes [55]. \n\nElectrospinning membranes have been reported for application in separation processes, \n\nespecially in pressure-driven separations, such as microfiltration, ultrafiltration or \n\nnanofiltration [103-105], but for this type of application it is required a support that provides \n\nmechanical strength, unlike conventional cast membranes. Consequently, nowadays, \n\nelectrospinning membranes used in filtration technology are based in hybrid systems, i.e., \n\nelectrospun nanofibres are placed over a support and combined in various layers or blended \n\ntogether with micron scale fibres [106]. \n\n \n\n1.4 Hydrogel membranes \n\nCurrently, there are several UF membranes commercially available that can be used for pDNA \n\npurification [20, 23]. Considering the size of pDNA molecules, surface modification of \n\nmicrofiltration membranes also arises as a possible choice, offering the possibility of adjusting \n\nthe desired selectivity in each particular case. Several studies have shown the enhancement of \n\nmembrane properties such as resistance to fouling by proteins, biocompatibility, introduction \n\nof electric charge and improved hydrophobicity through surface modification methods [107-\n\n109]. In this work, a hydrogel coating (agarose) was impregnated to a commercial MF membrane \n\nwith 0.22 \u00b5m of nominal pore diameter (membrane selected based on its cost-effective value, \n\nmechanical strength and heat resistance which facilitates the impregnation of a hot solution \n\n[110]) by an adaptation of a method described in literature [111]. The deposition of the agarose \n\nlayer and its impregnation through the porous structure of the MF membrane was expected to \n\nprovide a substantial increase of pDNA rejection comparing to the non-modified membrane. \n\nFrom the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a modified MF membrane is evaluated \n\nfor its possible application in a pDNA purification process. \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n23 \n\n \n\n1.4.1 Hydrogel characteristics \n\nThe widespread use of hydrogels in areas such as liquid chromatography, drug delivery, and \n\ntherapeutic implants, and the existence of various body tissues with gel-like characteristics \n\n(i.e. connective tissue and basement membranes) make it important to understand the rates \n\nof plasmids transmissions and other macromolecules through these materials [111]. In \n\nseparation and purification of biological macromolecules, it is important to study the gel \n\nfiltration medium. The gels based on cross-linked polysaccharides have been regarded as close \n\nto ideal and most media on the market today are based on these materials. However, even if \n\nhydrophilicity and inertness are necessary properties of a functional gel filtration medium, \n\nthere are a number of other requirements, such as adequate pore size distribution, rigidity, \n\nphysical and chemical stability, which also have to be fulfilled. Media-based on cross-linked \n\nagarose share most of these properties [112]. \n\nIn the present work, agarose was chosen also for its hydrophilic and thermo-responsive \n\ncharacter; this linear polysaccharide extracted from marine algae, consisting of 1,4-linked 3,6-\n\nanhydro-?-l-galactose and 1,3-linked ?-d-galactose derivatives forms a thermo-reversible gels, \n\nwhen a homogeneous solution is cooled from 90 \u00baC to a temperature below the ordering \n\ntemperature, which is around 35 \u00baC. This phenomenon is based on the physical cross-linking of \n\nthe helical structure formed by the agarose polymer. The physical cross-linking gives rise to a \n\nthree dimensional network of aggregated polymer molecules; its pore-size distribution only \n\ndepends on the agarose concentration of the starting solution. By covalent cross-linking the \n\naggregated polymers in an aqueous environment, the chemical and physical stability of agarose \n\ngels can be considerably improved [112]. Agarose gels have been investigated in several \n\napplications due to their suitable properties for membrane modification and impregnation, and \n\nthe mechanical properties presented can be easily tailored by varying the polymer \n\nconcentration [113, 114]. Due to its physical properties, when agarose is solubilized in water, \n\nit forms a gel with a rigid network, resulting on a three-dimensional porous structure providing \n\na rigid assembly when lies at room temperature (RT) [114]. Agarose gel appears as an \n\napyrogenic, colourless and transparent gel, which is viscous-elastic at temperatures above 45 \n\n\u00baC [115]. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter I: Introduction \n\n24 \n\n \n\n1.5 Objectives \n\nIn this work, electrospinning and impregnation techniques were used in order to produce \n\nfiltration membranes to be applied in plasmid DNA purification. The present master thesis work \n\nplan had the following aims: \n\n? Produce electrospun membranes using Poly ?-Caprolactone and Polyethylene Oxide/k-\n\ncarrageenan, and modify a commercial microfiltration membrane by impregnation with a \n\nhydrogel (agarose); \n\n? Characterization of the properties of the produced ENMs and modified MF membrane by \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy, Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared \n\nSpectroscopy, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, determination of the Contact Angle, \n\nMembrane Porosity and average pore size determination with reference solutes. \n\n?

Calcium chloride (MW = 110.99 g/mol), \n\nkanamycin sulphate, PEO (MW=300,000 g/mol), PCL (MW=80,000 g/mol) and Terrific Broth \n\nmedium for bacterial culture were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (Sintra, Portugal). k-carrageenan \n\n(MW = 401.3193 g/mol) was obtained for FMC BioPolymer (Philadelphia, PA, United States). \n\nNZYMaxiprep kit for bacterial cell lyses and pDNA purification was acquired from NZYTech \n\n(Lisboa, Portugal) and Tris-HCl 10 mM was from IZASA (Lisboa, Portugal). A microfiltration \n\nNylaflo membrane (pore diameter of 0.22 ?m) was purchased from Pall Corporation. \n\n \n\n2.2 Methods \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Bacterial growth, cell lysis and pDNA purification \n\nThe plasmid production procedure was adapted from the literature [20, 21, 116]. The 6050 bp \n\nplasmid pVAX1-LacZ was amplified in a cell culture of E. coli DH5?. The fermentation was \n\ncarried out at 37 \u00baC in 250 mL of Terrific Broth medium, supplemented with 50 \u00b5g/mL of \n\nkanamycin. Growth was suspended at the late log phase (OD600nm ? 10-11) and the cells were \n\nharvested by centrifugation. Afterwards, pDNA extraction was performed using an NZYMaxiprep \n\nkit. That kit contains three buffers to perform the alkaline lysis, respectively: \n\n? Resuspension buffer (P1): solution of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.00 and 10 mM EDTA; \n\n? Lysis buffer (P2): solution of 200 mM NaOH and 1% SDS (w/v); \n\n? Neutralization buffer (P3): Solution of 3 M of potassium acetate at pH = 5.00. \n\nBesides the buffers, the kit also contains purification columns to obtain a pDNA free of \n\ncontaminants. After the extraction and purification, pDNA was stored at 4 \u00baC before filtration \n\nassays. \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Electrospinning setup \n\nA conventional electrospinning system was used to produce the membranes. The apparatus was \n\ncomposed by a high power voltage supply (Spellman CZE1000R, 0-30 kV), a syringe pump (KDS-\n\n100), a plastic syringe with a stainless steel needle and an aluminium disk (radius 2.4 cm) \n\nconnected to a copper collector. To produce fibres there must be a driving force generated by \n\n\n\nChapter II: Materials and methods \n\n27 \n\n \n\nthe electromagnetic field created between the needle, which is positively charged by high \n\nvoltage source, and the metal collector, which is grounded [21, 55]. \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Preparation of the polymer solutions \n\nThe PCL polymer solution (10% w/v) was prepared by dissolving the polymer in acetone, at 50 \n\n\u00baC, under constant stirring [117]. Meanwhile, a PEO/k-carrageenan solution was prepared by \n\nmixing and dissolving 6.75% (w/v) of PEO and 0.5% (w/v) of k-carrageenan in MiliQ water, under \n\nconstant stirring too [118]. \n\nThe solution of agarose (2% w/v) was prepared by dissolving the polymer in MiliQ water under \n\nconstant stirring, at 90 \u00baC [119]. \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Electrospun nanofibre membranes production \n\nTo produce the support ENM, a PCL polymer solution (Figure 10a) was injected at a constant \n\nflow rate of 3 mL/h and subjected to an applied voltage of 15 kV and with the collector placed \n\nat 10 cm from the needle [117]. After the production of the support, the PEO/k-carrageenan \n\npolymer solution (Figure 10b and c, respectively) was deposited over the PCL ENM by \n\nelectrospinning, in the same equipment, at a constant flow rate of 0.6 mL/h and an applied \n\nvoltage of 18 kV, thereby obtaining a bi-layer membrane. At least, the Coated Electrospun \n\nNanofibre Membrane (ENMC) was crosslinked in a calcium chloride solution for 24 h [21, 118]. \n\nFrom the obtained films, membrane disks were cut with suitable size to be used in the filtration \n\ncell, using a circular blade [21]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II: Materials and methods \n\n28 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 PCL (a), PEO (b) and k-carrageenan (c) chemical structure. \n\n \n\n2.2.5 Modification of a commercial microfiltration membrane \n\nA nylon 6,6 (Figure 11b) hydrophilic membrane, Nylaflo from Millipore was modified by agarose \n\n(Figure 11a) impregnation. The modification method was adapted from the literature [111] \n\nthrough the deposition of agarose to improve pDNA rejection (Figure 11a). An agarose solution \n\n(prepared by the method mentioned in section 2.2.3) was cooled down to a temperature of 70 \n\n\u00b0C and deposited over the MF membrane. To avoid air bubbles during the process, two glass \n\nplates were used and clamped. After 30 min., the membrane was cooled until reach the room \n\ntemperature (RT) [119]. \n\n\n\nChapter II: Materials and methods \n\n29 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 Agarose (a) and Nylon 6,6 (b) chemical structure. \n\n \n\n2.2.6 Scanning electron microscopy \n\nThe morphology of all the membranes was analysed by SEM. Samples of ENMs were air-dried \n\novernight and samples of modified-Nylaflo membrane were frozen using liquid nitrogen and \n\nfreeze-dried overnight. Then, all the samples were mounted onto aluminium stubs with double \n\nadhesive tape and sputter-coated with gold using a Quorum Q150R ES sputter coater. The \n\nsamples were analysed using a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope operated at an \n\naccelerating voltage of 20 kV and at different amplifications [21, 116]. \n\nThe diameter distribution of the nanofibres in the ENMs was determined from 50 measurements, \n\nat least, using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda (MD), United States of America). \n\n \n\n2.2.7 Attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy \n\nIn infrared spectroscopy the radiation crosses the sample, being partially absorbed and partially \n\ntransmitted. The resulting spectra represent the frequency of vibration between the atoms \n\nlinkage from the sample, creating therefore, a specific spectra for those interactions [120]. \n\nPCL, k-carrageenan, PEO, polymer coated ENMs, agarose, Nylaflo and modified-Nylaflo spectra \n\nwere acquired in the range of 4000 \u2013 525 cm-1, using a JASCO 4200 FTIR spectrophotometer, \n\noperating in ATR mode (MKII GoldenGateTM Single Reflexion ATR System). Data collection was \n\nperformed with a 4 cm-1 spectral resolution and after 128 scans [21, 116]. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter II: Materials and methods \n\n30 \n\n \n\n2.2.8 Energy dispersive spectroscopy \n\nIn order to determine the percentage of the characteristic elements of the Nylaflo and \n\nmodified-Nylaflo membranes, EDS (Bruker XFlash Detector 5010) analysis was carried out. For \n\nthat, samples were placed on aluminium stub supports and air-dried at room temperature [121]. \n\n \n\n2.2.9 Contact angle determination \n\nContact angles of the membranes were determined using a Data Physics Contact Angle System \n\nOCAH 200 apparatus, operating in static mode. For each sample, solvent drops were placed at \n\nvarious locations of the analysed surface, at room temperature. The reported contact angles \n\nare the average of, at least, three measurements [21]. \n\n \n\n2.2.10 Membrane porosity determination \n\nThe membrane porosity method was previously described [21]. Briefly, the total porosity of the \n\nmembranes was measured through the determination of the amount of ethanol absorbed by the \n\nmembranes using the following equation [122]: \n\n \n\nP(%) =\n?2 ? ?1\n\n?????????????????\n\u00d7 100 \n\n \n\nwhere W1 and W2 are the weight of the dry membrane and the weight of the wet membrane, \n\nrespectively, dethanol is the density of the ethanol at room temperature, and Vmembrane is the \n\nvolume of the membrane. The latter was determined from the membrane area and by \n\nmeasuring the membrane thickness with a micrometer Adamel Lhomargy M120 acquired from \n\nTesting Machines Inc., USA. \n\n \n\n2.2.11 Plasmid DNA experiments \n\nAll the membrane filtration experiments were performed in a 10 mL stirred cell from \n\nAmicon/Millipore (Figure 12), model 8010, according to a procedure previously described in the \n\nliterature [20, 123]. The filtration cell has a \"dead-end\" geometry. The membrane was \n\npositioned on a horizontal support which enables the permeate to be collected through a \n\ncircular array of channels. Mass transfer of the retained compounds by the membrane, from \n\nthe membrane surface back to the bulk of the solution, can be controlled by mechanical stirring \n\nof the solution. The filtration cell can be operated in two different ways: at constant pressure \n\nor constant flux (Figure 13). \n\n(3) \n\n\n\nChapter II: Materials and methods \n\n31 \n\n \n\nAt a constant pressure the liquid is forced to permeate through the membrane, but the flux is \n\nnot easily controlled, only the transmembrane pressure. This method was used to wash the \n\nmembrane, to determine hydraulic permeabilities of the membranes produced and to perform \n\npDNA filtration tests with membranes with reduced hydraulic permeability. \n\nWhen the constant flux method is used, a peristaltic pump is placed downstream of the \n\nmembrane. With this method the flux can be directly controlled; this method is the ideal to be \n\nused for membrane characterization with reference solutes since solute rejections can be \n\ntheoretically related with the permeate flux, the average pore size and the solute molecular \n\nsize. However, this method can only be used when low transmembrane pressure gradients are \n\ngenerated. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 Scheme of the 10 mL stirred cell from Amicon/Millipore, model 8010. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 Scheme of the experimental set-up used for continuous filtration applying constant pressure \nand constant flux. \n\nConstant pressure \n\nConstant flux \n\n\n\nChapter II: Materials and methods \n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn each test, a new membrane disc was placed in the bottom of the filtration cell, being initially \n\nflushed with MiliQ water. Then, water was removed and 10 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl 0.15 M NaCl \n\n(pH = 8.00) buffer were introduced in the filtration cell to determine the hydraulic \n\npermeability. This was obtained at different pressures with compressed nitrogen (ranging 0.025 \n\nbar to 0.1 bar) by measuring the flux over a period of time. Six permeability measurements \n\nwere performed with each membrane, and the average value was considered as the hydraulic \n\npermeability of each membrane, Lp. To perform the filtration of pDNA solutions, the remaining \n\nbuffer in the filtration cell was carefully removed and immediately after that, 5 mL of 10 mM \n\nTris-HCl 0.15 M NaCl (pH = 8.00) buffer were placed in the cell with 100 \u00b5L of an aliquot of \n\npDNA (recovered by the method mentioned in section 2.2.1). A continuous filtration of the \n\ncontent of the cell was performed by applying a constant pressure and four consecutive samples \n\nof 0.5 mL of permeate were collected; these four samples correspond to the total permeate \n\ncollected in each run (the experimental setup is shown in Figure 13). The stirring speed was \n\nkept in all the experiments at 760 min-1 (previous calibration of the stirring system was \n\nperformed). \n\n \n\n2.2.12 Determination of Plasmid DNA concentration \n\nPlasmid concentration was determined by Ultraviolet/Visible Spectroscopy at 260 nm. The \n\nabsorbance of the initial pDNA solution (feed before the filtration assay) and the final \n\nconcentrate (feed after the filtration assay) were determined in each run (as well as the \n\nabsorbance of the four consecutive permeate collected samples previously mentioned). The 10 \n\nmM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl (pH = 8.00) buffer was used as the reference solution for measuring \n\nthe absorbance due to pDNA.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n             Results &amp; Discussion \n \n\n Chapter III \n \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n34 \n\n \n\n3. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n3.1 Characterization of the properties of the membranes \n\n \n\n3.1.1 Morphological characterization of the produced membranes \n\nThe fibre diameter and fibre average diameter (in case of ENMCs), and the surface appearance \n\n(in case of Nylaflo and modified-Nylaflo) were analysed through the SEM analysis. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 SEM images of PCL ENM (a), PCL ENMC (b), Nylaflo (c) and modified-Nylaflo (d). \n\n \n\nThe ENMs produced (figure 14a and b) present a high density of fibres. The ENMs containing the \n\nsecond layer leave even a higher density of nanofibres. The distribution of fibre diameter is \n\nshown in Figure 15. The PCL support has nanofibres with different diameters (200 nm \u2013 700 nm) \n\nand this range of fibre diameters is ideal to confer a good mechanical support [124], as \n\ndescribed by Bosworth et al., PCL meshes presents good mechanical properties [96]. As can be \n\nseen, the PCL coated with the k-carrageenan presents a higher density of thin fibres (fibres \n\nwith 100 \u2013 200 nm of diameter) than the PCL uncoated, which contributes to a decrease in the \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n35 \n\n \n\ndimensions of the interstices. The Nylaflo membrane surface with/without modification were \n\nalso analysed (Figure 14c and d). The results revealed that different surface morphologies were \n\nobtained after the modification process. As can be observed in Figure 14c the commercial \n\nmembrane surface showed to be porous, with much larger pores than the nominal 0.22 \u00b5m are \n\nobserved (nominal value given by the manufacturer), indicating a wide pore size distribution. \n\nAfter the modification with agarose the pores could not be observed anymore (Figure 14d). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 Fibre diameter distribution for the uncoated (a) and coated PCL ENM (b). \n\n \n\nSEM image of a cross-section of the modified-Nylaflo membrane was also acquired and shows \n\nthe agarose layer over the surface of the Nylaflo membrane (Figure 16). This layer will reduce \n\nthe porosity and the hydraulic permeability of the Nylaflo membrane, conferring characteristics \n\nof a UF membrane. \n\n \n\nFigure 16 SEM cross-section image of the modified-Nylaflo membrane. \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n36 \n\n \n\nThe porosity of the membranes, determined gravimetrically, was analysed and the results are \n\npresented in Figure 17. As can be seen, the porosity of the ENMCs membranes was similar to \n\nthe porosity of Nylaflo membranes which have been found to be not suitable for the purification \n\nof pVAX1-LacZ. Nevertheless, the porosity of the modified-Nylaflo membrane decreased to a \n\nmuch lower value, around 40%, than the original Nylaflo, about 80%. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 Determination of the porosity of the membranes by immersion in pure ethanol. \n\n \n\n3.1.2 Attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy \n\nanalysis \n\nAn ATR-FTIR (Attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared spectroscopy) analysis of \n\nthe membranes was also carried out to check for the presence of the coating layer on both \n\nmembranes. Figure 18 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of PCL, PEO, k-carrageenan and PCL/PEO+k-\n\ncarrageenan (polymer coated ENM) and Figure 19 shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of agarose, \n\nNylaflo membrane and modified-Nylaflo. The spectrum of k-carrageenan shows its \n\ncharacteristics absorption bands at 3388 cm-1 (-OH stretching) and at 1250 cm-1 that belongs to \n\nthe stretch of S=O group of sulphate group from the anionic polymer [98] (Figure 18a). The \n\nspectrum of PEO shows the characteristic bands of \u2013CH2 groups in the region between 2990 cm\n-\n\n1 and 2850 cm-1 [125] (Figure 18b). In Figure 18c it is presented the spectrum of PCL, which \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n37 \n\n \n\nshows an absorption band between 1750 cm-1 and 1740 cm-1 due to C=O groups [126]. The \n\nspectrum of ENMC (Figure 18d) shows the characteristic peaks of the functional groups of the \n\npolymers (PCL, PEO and k-carrageenan) used in membrane production, therefore indicating \n\nthat a thin layer of PEO/k-carrageenan was deposited on the PCL support as suggested by the  \n\nSEM images in section 3.1.1 (Figure 14). Furthermore, an intense peak around 3300 cm-1 was \n\nobserved, due to the over-abundance of OH groups in the coating layer, as previously described \n\nin the literature [127, 128]. \n\nFigure 19a shows the characteristics peaks of agarose at 3359 cm-1 (-OH stretching), 1042 cm-1 \n\nC-O stretch of sugar molecules, 1636 cm-1 (N-H) and 929 cm-1 (vibration of C-O-C bridge of 3,6-\n\nanydro-L-galactopyranose), in accordance with other reports [129, 130]. The ATR-FTIR \n\nspectrum of the Nylaflo membrane (Figure 19b) shows the characteristic bands at 3300 cm-1, \n\n2920 cm-1, 2860 cm-1 and 1640 cm-1 corresponding N-H stretch, CH2 asymmetric stretch, CH2 \n\nsymmetric stretch and amide C=O stretch, respectively [110]. Figure 19c shows that the \n\nhydroxyl group peak of agarose at 3359 cm-1 is presented in the modified-Nylaflo, unlike to that \n\nobserved in the spectrum of the Nylaflo membrane (Figure 19b). \n\nTo further verify if the coating is present on the surface of the PCL ENM and the agarose \n\nimpregnation has occurred, an EDS analysis was also performed. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 18 ATR-FTIR spectra of: k-carrageenan (a), PEO (b), PCL ENM (c) and PCL ENMC (d). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19 ATR-FTIR spectra of agarose powder (a), Nylaflo membrane (b) and modified-Nylaflo \nmembrane (c). \n\n \n\nThe amount of chemical elements at the surface of the PCL ENM and PCL ENM coated \n\nmembranes (Figure 20) shows that the surface coating of the PCL ENM was achieved due to the \n\nincrease of the amount of oxygen atoms (characteristic of polyethylene oxid), and the \n\nappearance of the sulphur peak (belonging to the negative group of sulphate present in the \n\nmolecule of k-carrageenan) (Table 4)  \n\n \n\nFigure 20 EDS spectra of PCL ENM membrane (a) and PCL ENM coated (b). \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n39 \n\n \n\nTable 4 EDS analysis of the membranes. \n\nSamples C (at %) O (at %) S (at %) \n\nPCL ENM 74.15 25.85 - \n\nPCL ENM coated 62.27 37.61 0.12- \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 21 shows the amount of chemical elements at the surface of the unmodified/modified-\n\nNylaflo membrane.

After applying the coat (PEO+k-\n\ncarrageenan) the contact angle decreased to 99.43\u00ba, indicating that the membrane became \n\nmore hydrophilic. The Nylaflo membrane showed to be the most hydrophilic, presenting a \n\ncontact angle of 28.03\u00ba for the modified-Nylaflo an increase on the contact angle was observed, \n\nhowever the hydrophilic character of the membrane was essentially kept, which is important \n\nto prevent the occurrence of fouling phenomena during the purification process, namely due \n\nto protein adsorption. \n\n \n\nTable 6 Contact angles of the membranes. \n\nMembranes Water contact angle \n\nPCL ENM 118.72\u00ba \u00b1 0.73\u00ba \n\nPCL ENMC 99.43\u00ba \u00b1 0.20\u00ba \n\nNylaflo 28.03\u00ba \u00b1 5.40\u00ba \n\nModified-Nylaflo 32.68 \u00b1 8.13\u00ba \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n41 \n\n \n\n3.2 Membrane filtration studies \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Hydraulic permeability \n\nThe results obtained in the permeability tests are summarized in figure 22. As can be seen, the \n\ncoated PCL ENMC and the Nylaflo membrane have, approximately, the same Lp values. The \n\nmodified-Nylaflo membrane shows lower Lp values when compared to the original Nylaflo. It is \n\nworth to note that the Lp values of the modified-Nylaflo were the typical of an UF membrane. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 Hydraulic permeability of the different membranes tested, T = 25 \u00baC. \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Estimation of the pore size of the modified-Nylaflo \n\nTaking into account the values of hydraulic permeability and the results obtained in the \n\nfiltration tests (discussed in the section 3.2.3), it was decided to determine only the pore size \n\nin the modified-Nylaflo membranes. \n\nThe pore radius of the modified membranes was estimated from the rejections of reference \n\nproteins using the theory of hindered transport of spherical solutes in liquid-filled pores [132], \n\nmore specifically using the method described as the symmetric pore model, SPM, in [133]. The \n\nSPM enables the immediate determination of the membrane pore radius from the intrinsic \n\nrejections of a reference solute with a known hydrodynamic radius, rs, and the Lp of the \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n42 \n\n \n\nmembrane [133]. Intrinsic rejections were calculated from the observed rejections, by \n\nestimating the mass transfer coefficient of the proteins in the concentration polarization layer, \n\nusing the correlation proposed by Opong &amp; Zydney [134]. The proteins used in this work and \n\ntheir relevant properties are summarized in Table 7. The observed rejections and the \n\ncorresponding estimate values of pore radius are indicated in Table 8. The hydraulic \n\npermeability of the membranes was measured before and after filtration to confirm the \n\nabsence of fouling in these tests. The average pore radius obtained was 33 nm, which is \n\nsubstantially lower than the nominal value of the pore radius of the Nylaflo commercial \n\nmembrane, which is 100 nm. \n\n \n\nTable 7 Selected properties of the proteins tested. \n\nProtein Mw (kDa) rs (m) Ds (m\n2/s) Ref \n\nBSA 67 3.55\u00d710-9 6.95\u00d710-11 [135, 136] \n\n?-globulins 158 5.59\u00d710-9 4.42\u00d710-11 [135, 136] \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 8 Observed rejections of BSA and ?-globulins at 760 rpm, 25 \u00baC at the indicated values of \ntransmembrane pressure.

Herein, \n\npDNA a flexible biomolecule was used in this study. After membrane characterization, the \n\nquantification of pDNA rejection was carried out (figure 23 and 24). \n\nAs can be seen in Figure 23, when the electrospun membrane (filtration with constant flux) was \n\nused, the rejection4 (Robs) has a tendency to decrease with the increase of the flux (Jv), which \n\nis indicative of the occurrence of significant concentration polarization. However, the most \n\n                                                 \n4 The rejection (Robs) is defined as 1-Cp/Cb, where Cp is the concentration of the solute (pDNA in this case) \nin the permeate and Cb is the concentration in the bulk of the feeding solution. \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n43 \n\n \n\nimportant fact to highlight about these results was the occurrence of pDNA rejection itself, \n\ntaking into account the very open structure of the produced membranes. \n\nFor the modified-Nylaflo membrane (filtration with constant pressure), at low fluxes of \n\npermeate the membrane presented near 100% of pDNA rejection, which makes it adequated \n\nfor application in pDNA purification (one cannot say the same about the PCL ENMC membrane). \n\nAlso, it was again observed that when the flux was increased, the rejection was decreased. \n\nKnowing the rp value of the modified-Nylaflo and the radius of gyration, rg, of the pDNA \n\nmolecule, Mor\u00e3o et al. [138] had recently shown that one can be accurately estimate through \n\nthe observed rejections of this type of flexible biomolecules, in the case of several conventional \n\n(asymmetric polymeric) ultrafiltration membranes [20, 23, 138]. The model used for the \n\ncalculations assumes the occurrence of flow induced molecular deformation of the molecular \n\nstructure of the macromolecules, which leads to their permeation through narrow pores, as a \n\nconsequence of the permeation flux. The probability of permeation, thus the intrinsic filtering \n\ncoefficient, can be estimated from the ratio rg/rp. In order to estimate observed sieving \n\ncoefficients it was necessary, also, to estimate the concentration polarization of the \n\nmacromolecule and for this purpose could be used the correlation obtained by Opong &amp; Zydney \n\n[134] as described by Mor\u00e3o et al. [138]. Using this model, the theoretical curve (shown in \n\nFigure 24) was calculated using rg = 90 nm; the rg value depends on the ionic strength of the \n\nsolution and it was estimated following the method proposed by Mor\u00e3o et al. [138]. The \n\nobserved rejections appeared to be significantly higher than what was predicted, strongly \n\nsuggesting that the structure of the hydrogel layer (agarose) affected the retention of pDNA \n\nmolecules, by significantly increasing it. A possible explanation for this phenomena may be \n\nthat, although the porosity of the modified-Nylaflo membranes decreased in respect to the \n\nnon-modified membrane. The experimental values obtained were still very high, in fact, near \n\n30% of porosity is a very high value for the membrane porosity of an ultrafiltration membrane, \n\nconsidering that conventional ultrafiltration membranes have typical porosities in the range of \n\n2-7% [135, 139]. The effect of the porosity at the membrane surface, which can be identified \n\nwith the ratio of the pore area to the membrane area, on the rejection of a large flexible \n\nmolecule like pDNA can be significant, considering that flow-induced deformation is expected \n\nto decrease as the porosity increases, due to less suction effects. A similar effect may also \n\nexplain the unexpectedly high pDNA rejections observed for the PCL ENMS membranes, taking \n\ninto account the high porosity of these membranes. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter III: Results and discussion \n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 23 Observed rejections of plasmid pVax1-LacZ by the PCL ENMC membrane. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24 Predicted and observed rejections of plasmid pVAX1-LacZ by the modified-Nylaflo membrane. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nConclusion &amp; Future \nPerspectives \n\n \n\n Chapter IV \n \n\n\n\nChapter IV: Conclusion and future perspectives \n\n46 \n\n \n\n4. Conclusion and future perspectives \n\n \n\nIn this work two different membranes were produced, an electrospun nanofibre membrane and \n\na modified nylon. The electrospun membrane was produced, by the deposition of a PEO/k-\n\ncarrageenan layer on a PCL support. Both layers (PEO/k-carrageenan and PCL) were produced \n\nby electrospinning. Electrospun nanofibres that have been previously used in a practical and \n\ncost-effective way for the production of polymer scaffolds and also for microfiltration \n\napplications were found to be not suitable, however, for pDNA purification since the obtained \n\nrejections are not high enough. \n\nThe modified-Nylaflo membrane presented characteristics of an ultrafiltration membrane, \n\nnamely in terms of hydraulic permeability and pore size, however with a very high porosity \n\nwhen compared to conventional asymmetric polymeric ultrafiltration membranes. The modified \n\nmembrane presented 100% of pDNA rejection at low values of flux. Accordingly, these \n\nmembranes can be used to purify pDNA. This fact and also the simplicity of the modification \n\nprocedure makes this type of modified membranes potential candidates for being used in \n\npractical applications for in pDNA purification.  \n\nIn future, through the optimization of the electrospinning process of k-carrageenan or using \n\nother negatively charged polymers, it is possible that UF membranes can be also produced \n\ntaking into account the importance of the electrical charge of the membrane for pDNA \n\nrejection. \n\nDespite the potential shown by modified-Nylaflo membranes there were some issues that need \n\nto be addressed before considering this work for industrial purposes. The most relevant one is \n\nthe production process feasibility in large scale which needs to be investigated. Furthermore, \n\npDNA recovery with simultaneous removal of the different contaminants (presented in the \n\nprocess stream before UF) namely RNA removal, needs to be investigated by testing membranes \n\nprepared with different agarose concentrations and possibly other hydrogels. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nBibliography \n \n\n  Chapter V \n \n\n\n\nChapter V: Bibliography \n\n48 \n\n \n\n5.

The results show\nthat membranes retained the suspended solids while allowing the permeation of plasmid DNA, with high\nrecovery yields and improved RNA retention.

Introduction\n\nThe development of new separation technologies suitable for\nthe large-scale production of highly purified plasmid DNA (pDNA)\nfor gene therapy applications and the production of DNA vaccines\nhas found increasing interest in the recent years [1\u20134]. The use of\nmicrofiltration and ultrafiltration membranes for pDNA recovery\nand purification from fermentation broths has been demonstrated\nas a promising alternative to conventional separation methods,\nnamely those involving precipitation with solvents and centrifuga-\ntion [5].\n\nElectrospinning is an easy and cheap method of producing\nnanofibrous materials. These can be obtained from a wide variety\nof polymers by controlling the solution properties and the process-\ning conditions [6]. The simplicity of this procedure and the wide\nrange of applications found in recent years, including tissue\nengineering applications, such as bone repair, wound healing and\ndrug delivery carriers [7\u20139], in sensors and biosensors [10], in elec-\ntrodes [11] and that of filtration [12\u201314] are important factors that\nlead to an increasing interest in developing new types of electro-\nspun nanofiber membranes (ENMs) [15]. Commonly, nanofibers\nll rights reserved.\n\nHenrique, 6200-506 Covilh\u00e3,\n099.\nare electrospun into a support or produced in layer by layer\narrangements [16,17]. In either case fiber deposition should be al-\nways carried out on a support which provides the required\nmechanical strength to the films produced [16].\n\nIn the present study, a poly e-caprolactone (PCL) support was\nprepared by a conventional electrospinning process. This polymer\nwas selected based on the good mechanical properties that PCL\nmeshes present [18] and also for being environmentally friendly\n[19]. A coating based on an electrospun mixture of two polymers,\nsodium alginate (SA) combined with poly(ethylene) oxide (PEO)\nwas deposited on the support. SA was selected for ENMs coating\ndue to its high hydrophilicity, relatively low cost and the ability\nof producing small diameter fibers by electrospinning, when mixed\nwith PEO [20]. This asymmetric arrangement of two different lay-\ners provides the membrane with adequate mechanical robustness\nwhereas separation selectiveness is regulated predominantly by\nthe ultrathin layer of nanofibers.\n\nThe bi-layer membranes produced were characterized in terms\nof their morphology, hydrophilicity and hydraulic permeability\nprior to the filtration tests. The performance of the ENMs on\nthe filtration of cell lysates, obtained immediately after the cell\nlysis step, was evaluated and compared with that of commercial\nmicrofiltration membranes. From the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first time that ENMs are tested in the recovery process of\nbiomolecules from fermentation broths.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2013.03.049\nmailto:icorreia@ubi.pt\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2013.03.049\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/13835866\nhttp://www.elsevier.com/locate/seppur\n\n\nT.R. Correia et al. / Separation and Purification Technology 112 (2013) 20\u201325 21\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nPEO (Mw = 300,000 g/mol), SA (Mw = 120000\u2013190,000 g/mol),\nPCL (Mw = 80,000 g/mol), calcium chloride (Mw = 110.99 g/mol)\nwere purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Sin tra, Portugal) as well\nas Terrific Broth medium for bacterial culture and kanamycin sul-\nfate. P1 buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH = 8.00, 10 mM EDTA and\n100 lg/mL of RNase A), P2 buffer (200 mM NaOH and 1% SDS\n(w/v)) and P3 buffer (3 M of potassium acetate, pH 5.00) were\nfrom a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit and Tris\u2013HCl 10 mM (IZASA,\nPortugal). Microfiltration membranes, Nylaflo (pore diameter of\n0.22 lm Pall Corporation and FSM0.45PP from Alfa Laval (pore\ndiameter of 0.45 lm).\n\n2.2. Methods\n\n2.2.1. Bacterial growth and cell lysis\nThe plasmid production procedure was adapted from the liter-\n\nature [5,21]. The 6050 bp plasmid pVAX1-LacZ was amplified in a\ncell culture of Escherichia coli DH5a. The fermentation was carried\nout at 37 ?C in 250 mL of Terrific Broth medium, supplemented\nwith 50 lg/mL of kanamycin. Growth was suspended at the late\nlog phase (OD600_nm ? 10\u201311) and cells were harvested by centri-\nfugation. Afterwards, pDNA extraction was performed by alkaline\nlysis using three different buffers (P1, P2 and P3, previously spec-\nified). For this procedure 120 g/L (wet weight) of cells were resus-\npended in 4 mL of P1 buffer. Then, 4 mL of P2 were added to\npromote cell lysis for 5 min, at room temperature. Finally, P3 buffer\nat 4 ?C was added to neutralize the alkaline solution. A large quan-\ntity of suspended solids was obtained upon neutralization and the\nsuspension was kept on ice for 15 min before membrane filtration.\n\n2.2.2. ENMs production process\nA conventional electrospinning apparatus was used for ENMs\n\nproduction. The system setup consisted in a high voltage source\n(Spellman CZE1000R, 0\u201330 kV), a syringe pump (KDS-100), a plastic\nsyringe with a stainless steel needle and an aluminum disk con-\nnected to a copper collector. PCL was dissolved in acetone\n(10% w/v), at 50 ?C, under constant stirring [22]. Meanwhile, a\nPEO/SA solution was prepared by mixing 6.75% PEO and 0.5% SA\naqueous solutions [23]. The PCL polymer solution was used to pro-\nduce a support ENM, using a constant flow rate of 3 mL/h and an\napplied voltage of 15 kV. The distance between needle tip and col-\nlector was set at 10 cm [22]. Subsequently, the PEO/SA solution\nwas deposited over the PCL ENM by electrospinning, in the same\napparatus, at a constant flow rate of 0.6 mL/h and an applied volt-\nage of 18 kV, thereby obtaining a bi-layer ENM. Finally, the\nFig. 1. Experimental set-up used for continuous diafiltrations,\nmembrane was crosslinked in a calcium chloride solution for\n24 h [23]. From the obtained films, membranes disks were cut with\nsuitable size to be used in the filtration cell, using a circular blade.\n\n2.2.3. Membrane filtration tests\nThese assays were performed in a 10 mL stirred cell (Amicon/\n\nMillipore, model 8010), according to a procedure previously de-\nscribed in the literature [19]. The membranes to be tested (Nylaflo,\nFSM0.45PP or the ENMs) were initially flushed with 20 mL of\nMilli-Q water at a constant pressure of 0.07 bar, to ensure the thor-\nough washing of the membranes. Then, the water permeability\n(hydraulic permeability) of each membrane was determined by\nmeasuring the flow rate, at that pressure. Five permeability mea-\nsurements were performed with each membrane disk and the\naverage value was considered the initial hydraulic permeability\nof each membrane disk, Lp0.\n\nTo perform the filtration of the E. coli DH5a lysates the remain-\ning water in the cell was carefully removed and, immediately after\nthat, 10 mL of lysate were introduced in the filtration cell. A contin-\nuous diafiltration of the lysate was performed for 1 h, using a\n10 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH = 8.00) buffer at a constant flow rate of\n0.5 mL/min. Two peristaltic pumps were used, one for feeding\nthe diafiltration buffer and the other to perform the filtration (by\nsuction). The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1. Under these\nconditions, one could estimate that, if no pDNA was adsorbed on\nthe membrane and the membrane rejection was 0, approximately\n95% of the pDNA was expected to be recovered in the permeate,\nwhile 5% would remain in the cell. It was decided to not try to re-\ncover the remaining pDNA to avoid excessive dilution of the whole\npermeate.\n\n2.2.4. Turbidity measurements\nThe filtrate was analyzed by UV/Visible Spectroscopy at a wave-\n\nlength of 600 nm, to determine the amount of suspended solids. A\nfraction of the alkaline lysate, containing the suspended solids, was\ntransferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 18,000g during\n30 min at 4 ?C (Hettich Zentrifugen, Mikro 200R). Then, the absor-\nbance of the supernatant was measured at a wavelength of\n600 nm and the value obtained compared with that of the mem-\nbrane permeates.\n\n2.2.5. Plasmid DNA and RNA quantification\nPlasmid DNA and RNA concentrations in lysates, were obtained\n\nby hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) [5]. Briefly, a 15\nPHE PE column (Amersham Biosciences \u2013 GE Healthcare) connected\nto an AKTA purifier HPLC System was used. The column was ini-\ntially equilibrated with 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4 in a 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buf-\nfer (pH 8.00). Prior to the injection, the suspended solids in lysates\nwere removed by centrifugation, as described in Section 2.2.4.\nshowing the two peristaltic pumps and the filtration cell.\n\n\n\n22 T.R. Correia et al. / Separation and Purification Technology 112 (2013) 20\u201325\nSamples from the supernatants were directly injected in the col-\numn. The injected volume in each run was 20 lL and the samples\nwere eluted at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min. Two minutes after\nthe injection, the eluent was instantly changed to 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl\nbuffer (pH = 8.00), in order to elute bounded species. This concen-\ntration was maintained for 5 min before the re-equilibration of the\ncolumn, which was carried out with 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4 in a 10 mM\nTris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8.00), in order to prepare the column for the\nnext run. The absorbance of the eluate at 260 nm was monitored.\nThe concentration of pDNA in each sample was calculated from\nthe area of the pDNA peak and a calibration curve, obtained with\npure pVAX1-lacZ standard solutions.\n\nThe filtration yield, in each test, was calculated as the ratio of\nthe amount of pDNA in the whole collected permeate to the\namount of pDNA in the lysate. The RNA removal was calculated\nas 1 ? (VpCRNA,p)/(VlysCRNA,lys) where CRNA,p is the RNA concentration\nin the whole collected permeate and CRNA,lys is the RNA concentra-\ntion in the lysate, Vp is the whole volume of permeate collected and\nVlys is the volume of lysate processed in each run.\n2.2.6. Scanning electron microscopy\nThe morphology of the membranes was analyzed by scanning\n\nelectron microscopy (SEM). Samples were air-dried overnight and\nthen mounted on an aluminum board using a double-side adhesive\ntape and covered with gold using an Emitech K550 (London,\nEngland) sputter coater. The samples were analyzed using a Hitachi\nS-2700 (Tokyo, Japan) scanning electron microscope operated at an\naccelerating voltage of 20 kV and at different amplifications [21].\nFig. 2. SEM images. (a) Nylaflo 0.22 lm membrane; (b) FSM0.4\nThe diameter distribution of the nanofibers in the ENMs was\ndetermined from 50 measurements, at least, using ImageJ (National\nInstitutes of Health, Bethesda (MD), USA).\n\n2.2.7. Attenuated total reflectance-fourier transform infrared\nspectroscopy\n\nPEO, SA, PCL and polymer coated ENMs spectra were acquired in\nthe range of 4000\u2013500 cm?1, using a JASCO 4200 FTIR spectropho-\ntometer, operating in ATR mode (MKII GoldenGate\u2122 Single\nReflexion ATR System). Data collection was performed with a\n4 cm?1 spectral resolution and after 64 scans [24].\n\n2.2.8. Contact angle\nContact angles of the membranes were determined using a Data\n\nPhysics Contact Angle System OCAH 200 apparatus, operating in sta-\ntic mode. For each sample, water drops were placed at various\nlocations of the analyzed surface, at room temperature. The\nreported contact angles are the average of at least three\nmeasurements.\n\n2.2.9. Membrane porosity\nThe surface porosity of the membranes was estimated from\n\nSEM images using the image analysis software, ImageJ. The total\nporosity of the membranes was measured through the determina-\ntion of the amount of ethanol absorbed by wet membranes, after\n1 h of immersion in that solvent, using the following equation [25]:\n\nP\u00f0%\u00de\u00bc\nW 2 ?

ATR-FTIR spectra of: (1) SA; (2) PEO; (3) PCL ENM; and (4) PCL ENMC.\n3. Results and discussion\n\n3.1. ENMs characterization\n\nThe morphology of the membranes, namely in terms of fiber\ndiameter distribution, fiber average diameter and surface porosity\nwas analyzed from SEM images. As can be seen in Fig. 2 the ENMs\nproduced present a high density of deposited fibers, in particular\nafter deposition of the second layer of nanofibers.\n\nFiber diameter distributions are shown in Fig. 3. The PCL sup-\nport has nanofibers with different diameters (200 nm \u2013 2 lm)\nand this range of fiber diameters is adequate for obtaining a good\nmechanical support [26]. The polymer-coated ENM presents a\nhigher density of thin fibers (i.e., fibers with 200\u2013300 nm of diam-\neter) than the polymer-uncoated ENM (i.e., the PCL support) which\ncontributes to a decrease in the dimensions of the interstices. The\nnumber average fiber diameter of the uncoated ENMs can be esti-\nmated to be 720 nm and that of the coated membranes to be\n430 nm. The commercial microfiltration membranes have typical\nvalues of pore diameter for this type of membranes, 0.22 lm and\n0.45 lm for the Nylaflo and FSM0.45PP, respectively (nominal val-\nues given by the manufacturers).\nFig. 4. Surface and total porosity of the ENMs and the commercial microfiltration\nmembranes.\nThe porosity of the membranes is analyzed in Fig. 4. As can be\nseen, the ENMs have porosities comparable to that of the 0.22 lm\nNylaflo membranes which have been found to perform very satisfac-\ntory in the filtration of lysates from plasmid pVAX1-lacZ fermenta-\ntion [5]. The porosity of the 0.45 lm membrane used is clearly lower\nthan that of the other membranes studied herein.\n\nAn ATR-FTIR analysis of the membranes was also carried out to\ncheck for the presence of the coating layer. The ATR-FTIR spectra of\nSA, PEO, PCL and the PCL/SA ENM (polymer coated ENM) can be\nseen in Fig. 5. The spectrum of SA shows its characteristic absorp-\ntion band in the region between 1610 cm?1 and 1560 cm?1, which\nis due to COO? groups [27] (spectrum 1). The spectrum of PEO\n(spectrum 2) shows the characteristic bands of ACH2A groups in\nthe region between 2990 cm?1 and 2850 cm?1 [28]. The third spec-\ntrum is that of PCL, which shows an absorption band between\n1750 cm?1 and 1740 cm?1 due to C@O groups [29]. The spectrum\nof the polymer coated ENM (spectrum 4), shows the characteristic\npeaks of the functional groups of the polymers used in membrane\nproduction, previously mentioned, therefore indicating that a thin\nlayer of PEO/SA was deposited on the PCL support. Moreover, a\nTable 1\nContact angles from the FSM, Nylon, uncoated ENM (PCL\nsupport) and PCL coated ENM.\n\nMembranes Water contact angle\n\nFSM0.45PP \u2013 0.45 lm 85.5? \u00b1 3.5?\nNylaflo \u2013 0.22 lm 18.4? \u00b1 0.1?\nPCL ENM 104? \u00b1 7?\nPCL ENMC 16.8? \u00b1 2.4?\n\n\n\nFig. 6.

Filtration yield of the different membranes tested in the filtration of lysates.\n\n24 T.R. Correia et al. / Separation and Purification Technology 112 (2013) 20\u201325\nmuch higher intensity peak around 3300 cm?1 was observed, due\nto the over-abundance of AOH groups in the coating layer, as pre-\nviously described in the literature [30,31].\n\nIn order to further characterize the surface properties of the\nmembranes, water contact angles were also determined to evalu-\nate the hydrophilicity of the membranes. This is an important\nproperty when considering the filtration of suspensions with high\norganic load; in fact, it is well-known that hydrophilic membranes\ngenerally perform better than hydrophobic due to adsorption phe-\nnomena [32]. The obtained contact angles are indicated in Table 1.\nAs can be seen, the uncoated PCL membrane presented a high con-\ntact angle of 104?, which is indicative of a hydrophobic character.\nAfter coating it with PEO/SA the contact angle decreased to 16.8?,\nwhich is a very similar value to that of the Nylaflo membrane.\nThe contact angle of the FSM0.45PP membrane is also very high,\nalthough lower than that of the uncoated PCL ENM. Herein, the fil-\ntration tests performed with this membrane aimed to check the ef-\nfect of the pore size on the permeate turbidity and permeability\nrecover after filtration.\n3.2. Membrane filtration studies\n\n3.2.1. Hydraulic permeability\nThe results obtained in the permeability tests are summarized\n\nin Fig. 6. As can be seen, the coated PCL ENM produced have\nLp0 values near 5000 L/h m\n\n2 bar, which are of the same order of\nmagnitude of those found for the Nylaflo membrane. The hydraulic\npermeability of the FSM0.45PP is clearly lower, which is possibly\ndue to its lower porosity and also its higher hydrophobicity, as sug-\ngested by the results obtained from contact angle measurements.\n3.2.2. Microfiltration of lysates\nAfter the cell lysis procedure is completed, using the previously\n\ndescribed method, a suspension containing a large quantity of pre-\ncipitates and cell debris is formed, nearly 2.4 g of suspended solids\nper gram (wet weight) of cells, as described elsewhere [33]. In re-\nspect to solids removal, the coated PCL ENMs and the Nylaflo mem-\nbranes gave identical results. Practically, all solids were removed\nduring the filtration, as can be seen by the turbidity measurements\n(Table 2). This indicates that both membranes have a similar aver-\nage pore size. The fact that the uncoated ENMs have a lower solids\nretention than the coated is in agreement with their higher average\nTable 2\nTurbidity of processed lysates (by centrifugation or microfiltration).\n\nCentrifugationa PCL ENM PCL ENMC\n\n0.002 \u00b1 0.001 0.030 \u00b1 0.001 0.0060 \u00b1 0\n\na As described in Section 2.2.4.\nfiber diameter, considering that the dimensions of the interstices\nbetween fibers becomes smaller as the fiber diameter decreases.\n\nIn respect to the process yield, in a previous study, where the\nsame lysis method was used the Nylaflo membranes presented\nhigh yields for the recovery of pVAX1-lacZ from the obtained\nlysates [5]. Using both coated and uncoated ENMs, high recovery\nyields were also obtained herein, as indicated in Fig. 7. In addition,\nthe results also reveal that a significant RNA removal can be\nachieved using the ENMs, reaching approximately 30% with\nthe PCL coated ENM. It is possible that the structural differences\nbetween ENMs and conventional microfiltration membranes can\nexplain the improved selectivity of the ENMs.\n\nWith the FSM0.45PP membrane the highest RNA removal was\nfound, however, much lower yields are also obtained. The occur-\nrence of severe fouling is likely to be the cause of the higher reten-\ntion of both pDNA and RNA. In fact, after a few minutes of filtration\nwith this membrane, the permeate pump was unable to impose the\npredetermined flow of 0.5 mL/min (73 L/h m2), which is indicative\nof the intense fouling. In order to accomplish the filtration, the stir-\nred cell had to be connected to a pressurized nitrogen reservoir\ncontaining the diafiltration buffer; the applied pressure on the feed\nwas adjusted to 0.5 bar and the permeate pump was disconnected.\nThe permeate flux decreased from 140 L/h m2 to near 20 L/h m2 by\nthe end of the diafiltration. Fluxes were determined from the vol-\nume of permeate collected as a function of time.\n\nThe fouling tendency of the different membranes can be better\nevaluated by comparing the recovery of hydraulic permeability\nafter filtration, i.e., after replacing the lysate suspension inside\nthe cell with water and then, measuring the water permeability\n(without subjecting the membranes to any cleaning procedure).\nThe ratio Lp/Lp0, is a measure of the tendency of the membranes\nto foul; the obtained values are shown in Fig. 8. As can be seen,\nthe coated PCL ENMs recovered almost completely their initial per-\nmeability upon filtration of the lysates. This indicates that the pro-\nduced membranes are highly resistant to fouling by the cell debris\nand other suspended solids present in the lysates.\n\nThe differences between the coated and uncoated ENMs should\nbe also pointed out, with the results clearly showing the impor-\ntance of the PEO/SA layer in preventing membrane fouling. The de-\ncrease in the average fiber size may have contributed to a better\nperformance of the coated membranes, by avoiding the accumula-\ntion of solids between the fibers, inside the electrospun films.\nHowever, the decisive factor affecting membrane performance is\nmore likely to be the increase in hydrophilicity, as it is suggested\nNylaflo FSM0.45PP\n\n.0009 0.0065 \u00b1 0.0009 0.024 \u00b1 0.008\n\n\n\nFig. 8.

Correia et al. / Separation and Purification Technology 112 (2013) 20\u201325 25\nfrom the fact that both the uncoated ENMs and the FSM0.45PP\nmembranes (that had the highest contact angles) present the\nlowest Lp/Lp0 values.\n4. Conclusion\n\nIn this work a bi-layer membrane was produced, by deposition\nof a PEO/SA layer on a PCL support. Both layers were produced by\nelectrospinning. Electrospun nanofibers that have been previously\nused in a practical and cost-effective way for the production of\npolymer scaffolds, are shown here to be also suitable to be used\nas microfiltration membranes, for processing complex suspensions\nof solids, with high fouling potential (which is the case of cell ly-\nsates). The bi-layer arrangement provided both the selectivity\nand hydrophilicity required for this application. In fact, the exper-\nimental results point out that the bi-layer ENM produced can per-\nform, at least, at the same level as commercial microfiltration\nmembranes, showing a comparable selectivity for retaining the\nsuspended solids while allowing the total permeation of the solute\nof interest (i.e., the plasmid), with an improved selectivity to retain\nRNA and an even better resistance to fouling. Moreover, the mem-\nbranes produced are environmentally friendly due to their known\nbiodegradability.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for\nScience and Technology (FCT), (PTDC/EME-TME/103375/2008 and\nPTDC/EBB-BIO/114320/2009).
