The compounds, based on the simple ortho\n\nphenylenediamine based bisurea scaffold, have been studied for their ability to facilitate chloride/\n\nnitrate and chloride/bicarbonate antiport, and HCl symport processes using a combination of ion\n\nselective electrode and fluorescence techniques. In addition, the transmembrane transport of\n\ndicarboxylate anions (maleate and fumarate) by the compounds was examined. Molecular dynamics\n\nsimulations showed that these compounds permeate the membrane more easily than other promising\n\nreceptors corroborating the experimental efflux data. Moreover, cell based assays revealed that the\n\nmajority of the compounds showed cytotoxicity in cancer cells, which may be linked to their ability to\n\nfunction as ion transporters.\nIntroduction\n\nThe regulation of cellular ion concentration by complex\nmembrane spanning proteins is critical for a range of biological\nprocesses.1 Misregulation of chloride transport has been asso-\nciated with myotonia, nephrolithiasis (kidney stones), Bartter\u2019s\nsyndrome and cystic ?brosis.2 Similarly, bicarbonate transport\nmisregulation is linked to a range of disease states,3 and has\nbeen linked with pathogenic mucus production in cystic\nthampton, SO17 1BJ, UK.

The prodiginines are one\nexample, with the anticancer activity of these molecules linked\nto their ability to facilitate both H+/Cl? symport and Cl?/HCO3\n\n?\n\nantiport processes.6\n\nThe synthesis of small molecules that function as membrane\nresident, mobile carriers for anions is an expanding ?eld of\nresearch. By incorporating hydrogen-bond donor groups into a\nsuitably lipophilic scaffold it is possible to transport anions\nthrough the hydrophobic interior of a lipid bilayer. Recent\nexamples of such scaffolds include the steroid-based chola-\npods,7 calix[4]pyrrole and its ?uorinated or triazole-strapped\nanalogues,8 amphiphilic catechols and monoacylglycerols,9\n\npreorganised isophthalamides and squaramides,10 and tripodal\ntris(aminoethyl)amine (tren) thioureas.11\n\nInterest in this area has grown to encompass transporters\n(carriers or otherwise) that show activity in biological\nsystems.6,12 To improve the likelihood of new transmembrane\ntransporter motifs exhibiting biological activity it is important\nto design compounds that have suitable absorption, distribu-\ntion, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) characteris-\ntics.13 There are guidelines, such as Lipinski\u2019s rule of ?ve, that\nChem.

By synthe-\nsising transporters that obey the rules of thumb de?ned by\nLipinski and others, the possibility that these compounds will\nbe biologically compatible is greater, i.e. have acceptable\nabsorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties.\n\nWe have previously shown that bisurea receptors in which\nthe two urea groups are linked by alkyl chains can promote\nchloride transport across phospholipid bilayers.16 In other work\nwe have shown that ortho-phenylenediamine-based bisureas are\neffective anion receptors.17 We decided to explore the anion\ntransport properties of ortho-phenylenediamine-based bisureas\nas promising candidates for biologically active ion transporters\nthat may conform to the rules of thumb de?ned by Lipinski and\nothers.14\n\nMolecules developed from this scaffold have found extensive\nuse in the ?eld of anion complexation; we have previously\nreported that ortho-phenylenediamine-based bisureas function\nas selective carboxylate complexation agents,17 whilst the anal-\nogous 4,5-dimethyl-1,2-phenylenediamine scaffold has been\nused to construct colorimetric anion sensors.18 These motifs\ncan be extended with additional hydrogen bond donor groups\nto yield receptors with enhanced anion affinity.19 Trisureas and\ntetraureas developed in this way show good selectivity for\nphosphate and sulfate,20 whilst a tripodal tren-based hexylurea\nfunctions as a sulfate extractant.21 Extended amidourea mac-\nrocycles based on these scaffolds exhibit good selectivity\ntowards carboxylates.22 Replacement of the phenylene core with\nanthraquinone yields colorimetric sensors for the detection of\nHg2+ and H2PO4\n\n?,23 whilst replacement with a cyclohexyl core\nhas been used for the chiral recognition of phosphate ions24 and\nthe colorimetric sensing of cyanide.25 Further, these molecules\nhave found other applications in crystal engineering,26 as gela-\ntors,27 and in catalysis.28\n\nIn this paper we report the transmembrane transport\nproperties of ortho-phenylenediamine-based bisureas 1\u20138, and\ncompare them to monoureas 9\u201311; the latter being analogues\nof the three most active bisurea transporters. The anion\nbinding properties of this series of compounds were deter-\nmined using 1H NMR titration techniques in DMSO-d6/0.5%\nH2O mixtures. Anion transport was studied using a combina-\ntion of ion selective electrode assays and ?uorescence tech-\nniques in phospholipid vesicles. In vitro viability and\n?uorescence assays have been performed in order to evaluate\nthe anticancer properties of these compounds. We show that\nthis hydrogen bonding array is a highly potent anion transport\nmotif with the most active compound studied showing trans-\nport at 1 : 1 000 000 receptor : lipid ratios. Effective transport\nat very low concentrations is a desirable feature allowing the\npotential use of these compounds in biological systems at low\ndose. Finally, in silico studies were also performed to bring\nfurther insights into the interactions of 5 and 6 with a lipid\nbilayer model.\n104 | Chem. Sci., 2013, 4, 103 117\nResults and discussion\nSynthesis\n\nWe have previously reported the synthesis of compounds 1,17a\n\n3,17b 6,17b and 8.17b Reaction of the appropriate isocyanate with\northo-phenylenediamine in dichloromethane/pyridine gave\ncompounds 4, 5 and 7 in 39%, 84% and 82% yields respectively.\nCompound 2 was prepared by a similar method, using\n4,5-di?uoro-2-nitroaniline as the starting material. Hydrogena-\ntion using Pd/C in methanol, followed by reaction with\nphenylisocyanate in dichloromethane/pyridine yielded\ncompound 2 in 37% yield.\n\nThe syntheses of monoureas 9,29 10,30 and 11 (ref. 31) have\nbeen previously reported.32 In all cases aniline was added to the\ncorresponding isocyanate in dichloromethane/pyridine to\nproduce compounds 9, 10, and 11 in 56%, 58% and 75% yields\nrespectively. These compounds are analogues of the three most\nactive bisurea transporters 4, 5 and 6.\n\nAnion binding in solution\n\nThe ability of compounds 1\u201311 to bind anions in solution was\ninvestigated using 1H NMR titration techniques in DMSO-d6/\n0.5% water (with the anions added as tetrabutylammonium\n(TBA) or tetraethylammonium (TEA) salts) both to provide\ncomparability with earlier studies33 and for solubility reasons.\nThe binding studies were performed for anions relevant to both\nour transmembrane transport assays and biological systems.\nWhere possible the change in chemical shi? of the most\ndown?eld NH signal was ?tted to a 1 : 1 binding model using\nWinEQNMR2 so?ware.34 The results are summarised in Table 1.\nPreviously reported stability constants are included for\ncomparison.17 Fitted curves and selected Job plots can be found\nin the ESI.\u2020\n\nIn general, compounds 1\u201311 exhibit strong 1 : 1 binding with\ntetraethylammonium bicarbonate, moderate 1 : 1 binding with\ntetrabutylammonium chloride and no signi?cant interaction\nwith tetrabutylammonium nitrate under the conditions of the\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013\n\n\n\nTable 1 Stability constants Ka (M\n1) for compounds 1 11 with chloride and\n\nnitrate (added as tetrabutylammonium salts) and bicarbonate (added as tetrae\nthylammonium salt) in DMSO d6/0.5% water at 298 K\n\na\n\nChloride Bicarbonate Nitrate\n\n1 (ref. 17a) 43 1370 b\n\n2 73 c,d b\n\n3 (ref. 17b) 67 2570d b\n\n4 74 e b\n\n5 78 2090d b\n\n6 (ref. 17b) 78 3770d,f b\n\n7 81 3140d,f b\n\n8 (ref. 17b)&lt;10 826e b\n\n9 41 2580 b\n\n10 61 1380 b\n\n11 57 1630d,f b\n\na All errors&lt;15%.

A sigmoidal binding curve was obtained for\ncompound 2 with tetraethylammonium bicarbonate that could\nnot be ?tted to a binding model.35 Job plot analysis suggested\n1 : 1 binding, however the plot was an unusual shape, that may\nbe due to more complex solution phase behaviour such as\ndeprotonation of the bound oxoanion.33b Signi?cant urea NH\npeak broadening was observed upon addition of tetraethy-\nlammonium bicarbonate to compounds 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 11.\nA stability constant could not be determined for compound 4\nwith tetraethylammonium bicarbonate due to this broadening\neffect, however Job plot analysis con?rmed 1 : 1 binding.\n\nComparing functionalised receptors 2\u20137 with receptor 1, it\ncan be observed that addition of electron withdrawing substit-\nuents to either the central core or the peripheral phenyl groups\nincreases anion affinity. In addition, it has been suggested that\nhalogenation of the phenylene core (2 and 3) can aid receptor\npreorganisation by increasing the acidity of the phenylene CH\ngroups, strengthening intramolecular hydrogen bonding inter-\nactions.17b For compounds 2\u20137 the binding constants obtained\nwith tetrabutylammonium chloride are of similar magnitude\nwhilst no signi?cant interaction was previously reported\nbetween compound 8 and tetrabutylammonium chloride.17b\n\nThis lack of interaction was attributed to intramolecular\nhydrogen bonding. The ortho-nitro groups may also provide a\nsteric constraint on the binding site. Similarly, compound 8 has\na signi?cantly lower binding constant with tetraethylammo-\nnium bicarbonate than compounds 6 and 7.\n\nColour changes were observed upon addition of tetraethy-\nlammonium bicarbonate to nitro-functionalised compounds 6,\n7, 8 and 11. Such behaviour has been reported previously in the\npresence of basic anions and has been attributed to deproto-\nnation in analogous systems.17b,18,25,36\n\nInterestingly, the two least active ion transporters (1 and 8)\ndisplay the lowest affinity for both chloride and bicarbonate.\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013\nThe most active transporter 6 has the highest affinity of the\nseries for bicarbonate. In addition, the monourea compounds\n9, 10 and 11 show reduced anion affinity compared to their\nbisurea analogues, demonstrating the impact of incorporating\nadditional convergent hydrogen bond donor groups into the\nreceptor scaffold.\n\nTo complement the transport studies, we attempted to titrate\ncompounds 4, 5 and 6 with tetrabutylammonium maleate and\ntetrabutylammonium fumarate in DMSO-d6/0.5% H2O.\n\n37 Addi-\ntion of the tetrabutylammonium dicarboxylate to the receptor\nsolution resulted in the formation of a precipitate in both\ninstances, preventing determination of a binding constant.\nInstead ESI mass spectrometry was used to examine the inter-\naction between bisureas and dicarboxylate anions. Compound 5\nwas studied owing to both its good solubility and high transport\nactivity. Negative ESI experiments with solutions of 5 and either\nmaleic or fumaric acid revealed the formation of 1 : 1 bisurea\u2013\ncarboxylate complexes in the gas phase. Further, by analysing\nsamples containing different ratios of bisurea host and\ncarboxylate anion it was possible to determine that compound 5\nbinds maleate more strongly than fumarate.38,39\nSolid state\n\nThe solid-state behaviour of compound 7 was examined using\nsingle-crystal X-ray diffraction (Fig. 1). Tables of hydrogen\nbonds, data collection and re?nement details, and thermal\nellipsoid plots can be found in the ESI.\u2020\n\nCrystals were obtained by slow evaporation of a methanol\u2013\nwater solution of compound 7 in the presence of tetraethy-\nlammonium bicarbonate. Analysis revealed that the meta-nitro\nfunctionalised bisurea forms a 2 : 1 (receptor : anion) complex\nwith carbonate, the encapsulated carbonate anion bound by\neleven hydrogen-bonding interactions. All the available urea NH\ngroups were found to be involved in hydrogen bonding the\ncarbonate (N\u2013O distances 2.726(2)\u20133.368(2) A?, N\u2013H/O angles\n139.0\u2013166.9?). It appears that in the solid state the meta-nitro\ngroup does not hinder guest inclusion.\nChem.

To\nmaintain charge balance, ion transport must occur by either a\nsymport or an antiport mechanism.40 The chloride efflux in\nFig. 2 could therefore be a consequence of chloride/nitrate\nantiport, chloride/sodium symport or HCl symport processes.\n\nTo examine the possibility of sodium/chloride co-transport,\nan ISE assay was performed using vesicles containing caesium\nFig. 2 Chloride efflux promoted by a DMSO solution of compounds 1 11 (2 mol\n% carrier to lipid) from unilamellar POPC vesicles loaded with 488 mM NaCl\nbuffered to pH 7.2 with 5 mM sodium phosphate salts.

Upon addition of the\n\u2018bicarbonate pulse\u2019 a chloride/bicarbonate antiport mechanism\nbecomes possible. A marked increase in transport activity was\nobserved for compounds 2\u20137 at this point (Fig. 3).\n\nLow levels of chloride efflux were observed for some of the\ncompounds in the two minutes before the bicarbonate pulse in\nthe aforementioned assay. To investigate this effect further, the\nexperiment was repeated without the bicarbonate \u2018pulse\u2019.\nSigni?cant chloride efflux was observed for some of the\ncompounds (see ESI, Fig. S59\u2020).\n\nEvidence in support of transmembrane sulfate transport has\nbeen observed previously for ?uorinated tripodal ureas and\nthioureas.44 To test if the chloride efflux observed in the afore-\nmentioned assay was linked to the transport of sulfate, uni-\nlamellar POPC vesicles were prepared containing 100 mM NaCl\nand 2 mM lucigenin buffered to pH 7.2 with 20 mM phosphate\nbuffer.

An increase in intravesicular pH was observed,\ncorresponding to deacidi?cation of the vesicles via either\nH+/Cl? co-transport or an equivalent Cl?/OH? antiport pathway\n(see ESI\u2020).\n\nThree modes of operation are known for synthetic trans-\nmembrane ion transporters; a mobile carrier mechanism,\nchannel formation, or a relay mechanism.47 We probed the\ntransport mechanism of these systems using an ion selective\nelectrode assay with POPC vesicles containing cholesterol (7 : 3\nmolar ratio). The vesicles were prepared containing sodium\nchloride (488 mM with 5 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.2) and\nsuspended in a solution of sodium nitrate (488 mM with 5 mM\nphosphate buffer at pH 7.2). By comparing the chloride efflux\nobserved in this assay with that observed in the absence of\ncholesterol we can deduce if these molecules are mobile\ncarriers. Cholesterol decreases membrane ?uidity and thus\ntransport that relies on a diffusion mechanism (i.e. mobile\ncarrier), is expected to be slower in the presence of cholesterol.48\n\nCompounds 2\u20137 all showed reduced chloride efflux in the\ncholesterol containing vesicles (see ESI\u2020).\n\nFurther evidence for a carrier mechanism was obtained from\nU-tube experiments.15,44 A membrane is modelled by two\naqueous phases separated by a nitrobenzene organic phase. The\nsource phase was loaded with sodium chloride (488 mM buff-\nered to pH 7.2 with 5 mM sodium phosphate salts) and the\nreceiving phase was loaded with sodium nitrate (488 mM\nbuffered to pH 7.2 with 5 mM sodium phosphate salts). The\ncarrier (1 mM) was dissolved in the nitrobenzene phase and\nchloride transport into the receiving phase was monitored\nusing an ion selective electrode. The separation of the two\naqueous phases rules out the possibility of channel formation.49\n\nFor solubility reasons only compounds 2, 4, 5 and 7 could be\ntested in this way. All yielded a higher concentration of chloride\nin the receiving phase than in the control (see ESI\u2020). These\nresults are further evidence that the compounds operate via a\nmobile carrier mechanism.\n\nTo quantify the transport activity of compounds 1\u201311 Hill\nanalyses50 for the chloride/nitrate and chloride/bicarbonate\nantiport assays were performed (see ESI\u2020). Hill analysis enables\ndetermination of an EC50,270s value; the concentration of carrier\n(mol% with respect to lipid) required to afford 50% chloride\nefflux 270 s a?er addition of the carrier (or a?er the bicarbonate\n\u2018pulse\u2019), enabling us to compare the transport activity of the\ncompounds. These values are summarised in Table 2, together\nwith the Hill coefficients (which provide supporting evidence\nfor a mobile carrier mechanism), the calculated values for polar\nsurface area (PSA) and total surface area (TSA) and log P.51 The\nPSA and TSA parameters were estimated as described in the\nESI\u2020 from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations carried out with\ncompounds 1\u201311 in water solution.\n\nIn general, we observed that incorporation of electron with-\ndrawing functionalities into the bisurea scaffold affords\nChem.

Indeed, para-nitro functionalised\ncompound 6 displays very high transport activity, facilitating\nchloride efflux at receptor : lipid ratios as low as 1 : 1 000 000\n(Fig. 5). To the best of our knowledge we believe that this is the\nlowest loading level of transporter observed that can facilitate\ntransport to date.\n\nWe have also examined the effect of varying substituent posi-\ntion on the peripheral phenyl rings (compounds 6, 7, and 8).

The ortho-nitro functionalised compound 8 displays\npoor transport activity, likely a consequence of the involvement of\nthe nitro group in intramolecular hydrogen bonding and also\nsterically hindering the binding site.17b This is re?ected in the\nstability constants for compound 8 with chloride and bicarbonate\n(<10 M?1 and 826 M?1 respectively) which are signi?cantly lower\nthan those observed for compounds 6 and 7.\n\nThe transport activity of the monourea analogues of the three\nmost active bisurea compounds (4, 5 and 6) were tested using\nvesicles containing sodium chloride (488 mM with 5 mM phos-\nphate buffer at pH 7.2) and suspended in a solution of sodium\nnitrate (488 mM with 5 mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.2).\nCompounds 9, 10 and 11 were tested at loadings of 2 mol% (with\nrespect to lipid), and the results compared to the efflux measured\nupon addition of compounds 4, 5 and 6 at loadings of 1 mol%\n(with respect to lipid).

The experiment was repeated at pH 4.0,\nwhereupon an enhancement in chloride efflux was observed\nupon addition of both maleate and fumarate pulses (Fig. 7\nshows compound 4 as a representative example).\n\nWe have already shown that pre-pulse chloride efflux is the\nconsequence of HCl symport and not sulfate transport or NaCl\nsymport. We can rationalise the pH dependant nature of the\ntransport by considering the pKa values for maleate (pKa1 \u00bc\n1.92, pKa2 \u00bc 6.23) and fumarate (pKa1 \u00bc 3.02, pKa2 \u00bc 4.38).52\nThus, at pH 7.2 a higher proportion of maleate exists as the\nmonoanion, whilst fumarate will predominantly exist as the\ndianion. Dianions are more hydrophilic than their mono-\nanionic counterparts and will consequently be more difficult to\ntransport.43 Hence, at pH 7.2 we observe an increase in chloride\ntransport upon addition of maleate, but little enhancement\nupon addition of a fumarate. At pH 4.0 the monoionic forms of\nboth maleate and fumarate will predominate, and an increase\nin chloride efflux was observed upon addition of both maleate\nand fumarate, corresponding to chloride/carboxylate exchange.\n\nIn summary, we have observed that ortho-phenylenediamine-\nbased bisureas functionalised with electron withdrawing\nsubstituents are potent ion transporters, facilitating chloride/\nnitrate and chloride/bicarbonate antiport. In some instances we\nhave observed carboxylate/chloride antiport and HCl symport.\nWe have demonstrated that these compounds operate via a\nmobile carrier mechanism and that sulphate transport and\nmetal/chloride symport processes are not facilitated.\nCell based assays\n\nThe potent anion transport activity of some members of the\nseries prompted examination of the in vitro cytotoxicity towards\na range of cancerous cell lines.

Upon proton-\nation this cell-permeable dye displays an orange ?uorescence\nand accumulates within acidic intracellular compartments.\nGreen ?uorescence is observed under the more basic conditions\nof the cystol.61 Cells in basal conditions were stained with AO\nand showed typical granular orange ?uorescence, correspond-\ning to cellular acidic compartments such as lysosomes (Fig. 9\nCt). A complete loss of orange ?uorescence was observed on\nexposure to compounds 5, 6 and 7 and a signi?cant reduction in\norange ?uorescence was observed with compounds 2 and 3.\nThis corresponds to an increase in the pH of the intracellular\norganelles, achieved through acidi?cation of the cytoplasm.\nGranular orange ?uorescence was retained with compounds 1,\n4 and 8, indicating that exposure to these compounds did not\nfacilitate changes in pHi. This ?nding, combined with the\ninactivity of compound 8 in the vesicle based ion transport\nassays, suggests that the cytotoxicity in this instance is the\nresult of a mechanism other than transmembrane ion\ntransport.58\n\nCancer cell death can be induced by sustained changes in\npHi.\n\n62 Molecules capable of facilitating HCl symport and\nCl?/HCO3\n\n? antiport have been shown to induce apoptosis by\nfacilitating ion transport processes that lower pHi.\n\n15,44,63 All of\nthe compounds that facilitated a reduction in pHi function as\nCl?/NO3\n\n? and Cl?/HCO3\n? antiport agents in vesicle based\n\nassays. In addition, the most active transporter (compound 6)\nhas been shown to facilitate HCl co-transport. The biological\nactivity observed in the AO assay could therefore be the direct\nresult of the transmembrane transport of HCl or bicarbonate, or\nthe result of ion transport coupled to the uniport of chloride.64\n\nApoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that facilitates\nthe removal of damaged cells without causing in?ammation\nand can be induced by sustained changes in pHi. Nuclear\ncondensation, fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic\nbodies are characteristic of this type of cell death.65 The type of\ncell death induced by compounds 1\u20138 was examined using\nHoechst 33342 staining in A375 cells. Hoechst 33342 is a ?uo-\nrescent nuclear dye, permitting changes in nuclear morphology\nto be monitored. In Fig. 10 untreated A375 cells have typical\nrounded nuclei (Ct).

In contrast, compound 8 induced\napoptotic cell death but organelle deacidi?cation was not\nobserved in the AO assay. The cytotoxicity of this compound\nthus appears to be unrelated to its ion transport activity\n(compound 8 was found to be inactive in vesicle based ion\ntransport assays) and may therefore be the result of an alter-\nnative mechanism.58 Compound 5 was shown to reduce the\nviability of the cell lines to a greater extent than compound 6\nwhilst compound 6 is the most effective anion transporter of the\ntwo compounds. This could be due to differences between the\nmodel membrane used for the vesicle studies and the biological\nmembranes present in the cells.

The chloride and bicar-\nbonate anions are promptly solvated by water molecules and\nreleased in the water phase before either 5 or 6 reach the\nwater\u2013lipid interface, which occurs within the ?rst 20 ns of the\nproduction runs as depicted in Fig. 12 for all anion complexes.\nThis ?rst insight indicates that in the water phase, 5 displays\nequivalent binding behaviours towards both anions and\nhenceforth the simulations carried out with 5$Cl? and\n5$HCO3\n\n? are analysed together.

Subsequently, regardless of\nthe relative position of the receptors to the interface, both p-\nsubstituents of 5 are preferentially located between the lipids\nchains, pointing to the bilayer core, while the ortho-phenyldi-\namine head with the two syn urea binding units are closer to the\nwater\u2013lipid interface, thus able to form strong hydrogen\nbonding interactions with the phosphate head groups as shown\nin Fig. 15 (le?). This is particularly evident in replicates R2 and\nR1 of complexes 5$Cl? and 5$HCO3\n\n?, respectively, where the\nreceptor mainly remains at the water\u2013lipid interface throughout\nTable 5 Average structural parameters area per lipid (A?2) and bilayer thickness\n(A?) of membrane systems, with the corresponding standard deviationsa\n\nSystem Area Thickness\n\nPure membrane\nExperimental71 64.30 39.10\nSimulated 64.38 ? 0.74 38.28 ? 0.37\nTransporters in POPC\n5$Cl R1 62.16 ? 0.53 39.34 ? 0.24\n\nR2 61.25 ? 0.49 39.80 ? 0.31\n5$HCO3 R1 62.67 ? 0.74 39.30 ? 0.44\n\nR2 61.50 ? 0.77 39.97 ? 0.30\n6$Cl R1 62.39 ? 0.40 39.14 ? 0.23\n\nR2 61.79 ? 0.91 39.67 ? 0.61\na The sampling time for the pure membrane was 40 ns, while the\nremaining systems were analysed during the ?nal 10 ns of the MD\nsimulation time.\n\n114 | Chem.

In contrast,\nthe slightly lighter receptor 6 (mol. wt 436.11 of 6 vs. 482.12 of 5)\npermeates the phospholipid bilayer more deeply during the\nsimulation time (see Fig. 12, bottom) with a non-speci?c spatial\norientation consistent with the existence of sporadic N\u2013H/O]\nP hydrogen bonds. These interactions generally occur via a\nsingle urea binding unit, as depicted in Fig. 15 (right), and are\nobserved during both MD simulations replicates of 6$Cl? (see\nFig. S96,\u2020 bottom), in spite of this receptor higher propensity to\nestablish hydrogen bonding interactions (see Table 3). In other\nwords, these results seem to indicate that N\u2013H binding sites of 6\nare available to bind the anions and consequently to promote\ntheir transmembrane transport, in agreement with the chloride\nefflux experimental data.\n\nIn order to ascertain the impact of 5 and 6 on the structural\nproperties of the POPC bilayer, the aforementioned simulations\nwere preceded by a simulation of the free membrane under the\nsame computational conditions. The following structural\nmembrane parameters, area per lipid, bilayer thickness, elec-\ntronic density pro?le and order parameters were evaluated and\ncompared with the corresponding experimental data and with\nthose found for the last 10 ns of MD replicates of 5$Cl?, 6$Cl?\n\nand 5$HCO3\n? complexes. The ?rst two parameters\u2019 values are\n\nlisted in Table 5, whereas the corresponding electronic density\npro?les and order parameters are plotted in Fig. S100 to S105.\u2020\nAs would be expected, the average values of the area per lipid\n(64.38 A?2) and bilayer thickness (38.28 A?) calculated for the free\nmembrane are similar to those recently obtained by neutron\nscattering (64.30 A?2 and 39.10 A?),71 and as reported when a\nPOPC bilayer with 128 lipids is simulated using the aforemen-\ntioned simulation conditions.69 The interaction of 5 and 6 with\nthe membrane produces a slight decrease in the area per lipid\n(<4.8%) and, consequently, a slight increase in the bilayer\nthickness (<2.2%), indicating that the in?uence of both recep-\ntors on these two structural parameters is small. The order\nparameters for saturated (sn-1) and unsaturated (sn-2) POPC\nlipid chains of the free membrane (see Fig. S99\u2020) follow the ones\npreviously found with LIPID11.69 Similar pro?les were obtained\nfor the membrane simulations carried out with 5 and 6 (see\nFig. S103 to S105\u2020), suggesting that the order parameters are\nunaffected by the presence of the receptors. In fact, the single\nexception was found for the sn-2 tails of POPC in replicate R2 of\n5$Cl? in which the receptor is preferentially located near of the\nwater\u2013lipid interface. Furthermore, the electronic density\npro?les for all simulated systems show that the bilayer structure\nis preserved without apparent interdigitation between the\nphospholipid tails as shown in Fig. S100 to S102, and further\ndiscussed in ESI.\u2020 In addition, the electronic density pro?les for\nthe receptors are consistent with their relative position to the\nwater\u2013lipid interface throughout the simulation time, as rep-\nresented in Fig. 12.\n\nThe energy pro?les associated with Cl? and HCO3\n? facili-\n\ntated transport across a phospholipid bilayer by ortho-phenyl-\nenediamine-based bisureas (namely 4, 5 and 6), as well as the\ntheoretical investigation of Cl?/HCO3\n\n? exchange mechanisms\nin more complex membrane systems (models of vesicles) and\nThis journal is \u00aa The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013\n\n\n\nEdge Article Chemical Science\n\nP\nub\n\nli\nsh\n\ned\n o\n\nn \n29\n\n A\nug\n\nus\nt \n\n20\n12\n\n.

Addition of electron\nwithdrawing groups to either the central core or the peripheral\nphenyl groups yielded potent anion transporters for the trans-\nmembrane transport of chloride, nitrate and bicarbonate with\ntransport observed at receptor: lipid concentration ratios as low\nas 1 : 1 000 000. Compounds 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 were found to be\ncytotoxic in a range of cancer cell lines. AO assays con?rmed\nthat these compounds can facilitate a reduction in pHi and the\ntwo most cytotoxic compounds (2 and 5) were found to induce\napoptosis in A375 cells. We have also demonstrated that our\nmost active transporters (4, 5 and 6) can facilitate the trans-\nmembrane transport of carboxylate species. We are continuing\nto study the transport of biologically relevant carboxylates. The\nresults of these studies will be reported in due course. The MD\nresults have demonstrated, at the atomic level, the ability of 5\nand 6 to permeate the membrane while having a reduced\nin?uence on its properties.\nAcknowledgements\n\nPAG thanks the EPSRC for a PhD studentship (SJM) and for\naccess to the crystallographic facilities at the University of\nSouthampton.72 CJEH thanks the EPSRC for a Doctoral Prize.\nThis work was supported by a research grant from the Spanish\ngovernment and the European Union (FIS-PI10/00338).
