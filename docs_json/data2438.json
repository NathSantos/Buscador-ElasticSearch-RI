The contribution of the heave\nmovement from floating platforms to the vibrations of drillstrings is still a subject not\nfully appreciated in the literature. This work deals with the dynamic behavior of the\ndrillstring through finite element analysis (FEA) when an oscillating axial displacement\nat the top is applied. Numerous drillstring models were generated using two-dimensional\nbeam elements that have degrees of freedom for the axial, shear, bending, and torsion types\nof displacement. The models incorporated an axial displacement at the top of a vertical\ndrillstring set at the bottom. Natural frequencies were obtained for all degrees of freedom\nconsidering different heave scenarios. The variation in the normal forces distribution due\nto the inertia effect on the entire structure caused a change in the stiffness for shear\nand bending degrees of freedom. The variation of natural frequencies related to shear\nwere obtained. In addition, the displacement of the neutral point in the drill column was\nobtained. The results presented here should contribute to future research on complex\ndynamic behavior of drillstrings.\n\nKeywords: Drillstring, Vibration, Finite element, Heave, Dynamic.\n\n\n\nRESUMO\n\nSANTOS, Nicolau Oyhenard.

and,\n\nconsequently, a great concern with economical viability of offshore projects. During periods\n\nof low barrel price, most companies prioritize production over drilling new wells in high\n\nwater depths, particularly in the Brazilian Pre-salt (Moreira Matoso Ribeiro Gomes et al.,\n\n2017).\n\nTo face these financial challenges drilling operations need to be the most secure,\n\nefficient and economical, they can be, and needs to avoid any additional expenditures.\n\nRegarding this issue, one of the most contributing factors of problems occurred during\n\noffshore drilling is equipment failure. Most offshore operations happen by renting Mobile\n\nOffshore Drilling Units (MODUs), which requires a substantial investment from the\n\noperator company. Each time equipment fails, a trip is necessary, that is the removal of\n\nthe entire drillstring and posterior placing of the same. Sometimes, it takes a full day for\n\nsuch an operation.\n\nVibrations are the dominant cause of drillstring fatigue. An absolute path to avoiding\n\nequipment fatigue is the previous simulation of drillstring behavior. Finite Element Analysis\n\n(FEA) consists of an excellent tool for behavior prediction and simulation of different\n\nsettings in complex systems. Besides, costs are diminished substantially by not applying\n\nthe trial and error strategy on expensive drilling projects (KHULIEF; AL-NASER, 2005).\n\nEarlier works have studied drillstring dynamic behavior concerning several aspects.\n\nHowever, the contribution of offshore platforms heave, vertical oscillatory movement, in\n\ndrillstring dynamic behavior for deep or ultra-deep wells wasn\u2019t extensively studied. This\n\nwork proposes bridging that gap by using finite element analysis.\n\n1.1 Drilling\n\nPrimarily, this section covers basic concepts about drilling and differences between\n\nonshore and offshore operations. A description of a typical drillstring used in deep wells is\n\ngiven. Offshore drilling platforms are discussed with special attention to ultradeepwater\n\nunits. The chapter finishes with a literature review of state-of-art research regarding\n\ndrillstring dynamic behavior.\n\n\n\n14\n\n1.1.1 History\n\nPetroleum is the energy necessary for almost every venture in the world, from\n\ntransportation of people and commodities to the production of some types of clothing\n\nand medicine. This energy stays buried underground beneath miles and miles of rocks\n\nand, sometimes, many miles of water as in offshore fields. All the activities to reach and\n\nretrieve the oil from such a difficult place without disturbing the environment safely and\n\neffectively are part of drilling engineering.\n\nThere are reports of oil well drilling activities from A.D. 300 in China and discussion\n\nstill exists on when and where was the first oil well drilled and who the pioneer was at\n\nthat time, but the industry in a general way recognizes some critical milestones. The\n\nmost famous landmark was the well drilled by Edwin L. Drake in 1859, 21.18 meters\n\ndeep, considered the first well originated from \u201dmodern drilling,\u201d taking into account\n\nthe previous methods, with the purpose of finding oil. The well produced initially 8 - 10\n\nbarrels/day of oil and the mechanism used is called today \u201dcable tool drilling\u201d(MITCHELL;\n\nMISKA, 2011).\n\nCable tool drilling consists on reaching the subsurface by repeatedly dropping a\n\nheavy iron bit attached to a cable, an engine at the surface is responsible for pushing back\n\nthe tool so that it can fall once again. This method, also called \u201dpercussion drilling,\u201d was\n\nadopted until the 1930s when rotary drilling became the standard in the drilling industry.\n\nWith the advent of rotary drilling, the industry changed. At the of the nineteenth\n\ncentury and beginning of the twentieth century, Patillo Higgins and Captain Anthony\n\nFrancis Lucas managed to reach a reservoir located 305 meters deep under a salt dome\n\nin Texas. At the time they used the more advanced rotary drilling method and, after\n\nfacing some challenges with unconsolidated sand, they reached the target depth producing\n\na burst and uncontrolled flow of 100 barrel per day of oil, as shown in Figure 1. That\n\nwell, named Lucas Spindletop, is considered one of the most significant milestones for oil\n\nindustry proving the superior capacity of the rotary drilling method and the presence of\n\nsubstantial accumulations of oil in the region (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011).\n\n\n\n15\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Lucas Spindletop well in 1901\n\nSource: (John Edward Brantly, 1971)\n\nThe use of floating units was introduced in well drilling in the 1950s. Exploration\n\nof offshore fields added new challenges to the industry and innovative technologies had to\n\nbe developed, and still are. Offshore drilling moved eventually to ultra-deep waters and\n\nnow, is a source of investment for many international oil companies.\n\nDrilling in deep and ultra-deep waters demands high initial investments and a low\n\nbarrel price creates a doubt when it comes to economic viability. The industry must adapt\n\nitself and every time the crude oil prices decrease, technology improvements are required\n\nto balance the financial equation, especially in relation to offshore exploration.\n\n1.1.2 Description\n\nA well is a hole that connects an underground hydrocarbons reservoir to the surface.\n\nGenerally, the objective is to reach a depth stipulated in a pre-defined diameter within\n\nthe time and cost programmed, respecting a predetermined operational window and\n\nguaranteeing the safety of the workers involved.\n\nA tool at the surface imposes rotation to a set of interconnected pipes or the\n\ndrillstring, that rotation is eventually passed down to a drilling bit, placed at the bottom\n\n\n\n16\n\nand responsible for actually drilling the well by crushing or scraping the rocks. The weight\n\nof drillstring generates an axial downward force that helps to deepen the well. As the well\n\nincreases, the drillstring keeps getting longer by connecting new tubes at the top.\n\nTo maintain a clean well, drilling fluid is circulated inside the drillstring from the\n\nsurface to bottom of the well, reaching the annular between the drillstring and the borehole\n\nthrough orifices located in the drill bit. The function of this \u201dmud\u201d is to remove the\n\ncuttings and lift them to the surface. When the mud reaches the surface, it is treated so\n\nthat it can once again circulate inside the well. Figure 2 shows the usual process of rotary\n\ndrilling.\n\nFigure 2 \u2013 A drillstring and the necessary basic elements for drilling.\n\nSource: (J.J. Azar; G. Robello Samuel, 2007)\n\nWells can have many purposes, and the quantity of personnel, equipment and the\n\ntypes of services depend on the objective of the well. Exploratory wells, or wildcat wells,\n\nare the first wells drilled to discover a reservoir still unexplored. After finding a reservoir,\n\n\n\n17\n\nadditional wells can be drilled to gather more information on the extension and possible\n\nproductivity of the field; these wells are called appraisal wells (or extension wells). If the\n\nreservoir is considered economically viable, new wells with the purpose of producing oil\n\nand gas are called development wells. Additionally, wells can serve different purposes such\n\nas injection, stratigraphic tests, and blowout reliefs.\n\nBefore every drilling activity, a company needs to own the rights to operate on\n\nthe field. In some cases, the financial risks and profits of exploring a field are divided\n\nby a group of companies or a consortium. In the latter case, one of the companies takes\n\nthe lead and is called the operator, and the other companies can participate or not\n\non operational decisions depending on the consortium contract. Assuming an operator\n\ncompany exists and a location to drill an exploratory well is pinpointed by the geological\n\nteam, a drilling contractor is hired to actually drill the well by first planning the entire\n\noperation, considering possible risks and following industry\u2019s standards on Health, Safety\n\nand Environment (HSE), consulting the operator company and executing the task.\n\nPossible actions may be necessary before moving equipment and personnel such as\n\nstudying seabed capability of installing equipment or preparing a site if it\u2019s in a remote\n\narea. The operator may have a representative drilling engineer or a group of specialists\n\npresent at the moment of drilling the well depending on the importance of the operation.\n\nThe professional representing the operator company may change the well plan in case\n\nof new circumstances present during the operation, but normally there is a great level\n\nof communication between the rig and the onshore headquarters regarding operational\n\ndecisions. The person responsible for rig personnel and operation as a whole is called the\n\ntool pusher, usually a qualified professional with many years of experience working on\n\ndrilling rigs. Also, drilling service companies can participate by executing diverse tasks\n\nduring drilling such as handling drilling fluid, performing well logging or monitoring the\n\nwell. Figure 3 shows the typical drilling rig organization.\n\n\n\n18\n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Usual organization on a drilling rig.\n\nSource: (BOURGOYNE et al., 1986)\n\n1.1.3 Drilling rigs\n\nRotary drilling can occur through the use of land or maritime rigs. The weight\n\ncapacity, type of equipment, degree of automation and environment the platform can\n\noperate will depend on the scenario.\n\nLand rigs may be conventional or mobile. Conventional land rigs are assembled\n\non site, demanding more time for rig preparing and disassembling before and after the\n\noperations. Mobile land rigs are usually carried on trucks pre-assembled so that when\n\non site, they can be put into action more quickly. Some modern land rigs have such a\n\nlow overall weight that they can be transported by helicopter, ideal for cases of remote\n\nlocations such as jungle or deserts. Figure 4 shows an example of a mobile land rig.\n\n\n\n19\n\nFigure 4 \u2013 A mobile land rig with a portable mast in the vertical position.\n\nSource: (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011)\n\nThe first drilling activities in water began inland above structures such as artificial\n\nislands and wharves where the drilling equipment would be installed to drill wells in order\n\nto reach reservoirs below lakes or rivers. Marine rigs came later even though there was\n\nevidence of the existence of underwater hydrocarbon reservoirs, mainly because of difficult\n\nlogistics at the time. The first marine rigs were submersible drilling barges with capacity\n\nof operating in depths between 3 and 6 meters (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011).\n\nFixed platforms appeared in the mid-1940s to be used in shallow waters where the\n\nmaximum water depth are up to 1500 ft (460 m) (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011). Fixed\n\nplatforms are bottom supported structures that are transported and mounted on location.\n\nThe primary type of fixed platforms uses a jacket structure between the seafloor and\n\nthe surface. This type of rig usually remains in the area for post-drilling production and\n\npre-processing. Many wells can be tied back to the same platform so that production is\n\ncentralized and logistics are easier to handle. The drilling rig can stay or be removed from\n\nthe fixed platform depending on the company\u2019s strategy. Figure 5 displays an example of\n\na fixed rig.\n\n\n\n20\n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Simplified example of a fixed rig.\n\nSource: (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011)\n\nSoon after, investing in mobile offshore drilling started. Fixed platforms weren\u2019t\n\nsuitable to drill wells in multiple locations due to the necessity of high initial investments\n\nand the impossibility of moving the rig after drilling. As a transition from fixed rigs, the\n\nmost used bottom supported, but mobile, are the jackup rigs. This type of vessel has from\n\n3 to 5 retractable legs that, when on site, are lowered to the sea floor and the platform\n\nelevated to the air as shown in Figure 6. When operations end the platform is lowered to\n\nwater level, and its legs are \u201djacked up\u201d.\n\n\n\n21\n\nFigure 6 \u2013 A jackup rig self elevating.\n\nSource: (J.J. Azar; G. Robello Samuel, 2007)\n\nJackup rigs could move from place to place to drill new well, but the fact that they\n\nare bottom-supported gives a great limitation to its use in the sea. Maximum water depth\n\nfor these rigs are approximately 106 meters (350 ft.) (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011).\n\nFloating platforms such as semisubmersibles and drillships became the preferred\n\noptions when exploring in deep waters. The semisubmersible (Figure 7) is a floating\n\nplatform with two hulls for buoyancy; a compartment is filled with water and, together\n\nwith an anchoring system there is reasonable stability for drilling operations. The platform\n\nis usually toed to arrive at the well location, and after the activities are complete, the\n\nplatform is guided to drill in another area. This type of platform also serves as a production\n\nplatform with pre-processing capabilities in deepwater reservoirs. Modern semisubmersible\n\nrigs have dynamic position capabilities and sensors installed on the wellhead to provide\n\ngreater stability and to assure that the rig remains above the well at all times (RITTO,\n\n2010).\n\n\n\n22\n\nFigure 7 \u2013 An ultradeepwater semisubmersible platform from Transocean Inc.\n\nSource: (LAKE, 2006)\n\nThe drillship is a ship-like drilling platform. It is capable of moving into locations\n\nby itself. It can operate in the most profound water depths, up to 3000 meters. Modern\n\nversions capable of drilling in ultradeep waters usually have dynamic positioning systems\n\nto control the ship\u2019s motion. Platforms like the one shown in Figure 8 is called Floating\n\nProduction Storage and Offloading vessels because of its multifunctionality and high level\n\nof autonomy.\n\n\n\n23\n\nFigure 8 \u2013 A modern drillship.\n\nSource: (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011)\n\n1.1.4 Drilling Rig Systems\n\nDrilling rigs in an offshore area usually have systems responsible for particular\n\nfunctions while drilling a well. Those systems are:\n\n\u2022 power system;\n\n\u2022 hoisting system;\n\n\u2022 circulating system;\n\n\u2022 rotary system;\n\n\u2022 well control system;\n\n\u2022 well monitoring system;\n\nThe power system generates the energy required for the rig to operate. Diesel\n\nengines are the primary source of energy in the platform. That energy is transmitted all\n\nthe other systems that require electricity.\n\nThe hoisting system is responsible for lifting or lowering equipment in the rig. It\u2019s\n\nmainly composed of the drawworks, the drilling line, the block and tackle, the derrick, the\n\nsubstructure and ancillary equipment.\n\nThe circulating system is responsible for circulating drilling fluid. The route is from\n\nthe platform into the drillstring, through the drill bit orifices, into the annular and back\n\nto the platform while carrying the cuttings so that it can be cleaned and reused.\n\n\n\n24\n\nThe rotary system provides rotation to the drill bit. In older rigs, the primary\n\nsource of rotation is the rotary table, a device that has a geometrical orifice on its center\n\nso that a shaft with a usually square or hexagonal cross-section transmits the rotation to\n\nthe drillstring. While \u201dmaking a connection\u201d, i.e., connecting a new pipe to the drillstring\n\nas the well deepens, a new tube is attached below the swivel, a device that combines the\n\nhoisting system and the circulating system supplying fluid to the interior of the drillstring.\n\nModern drilling rigs use top drives, a more advanced alternative capable of giving rotation\n\nand fluid flow without the need of a rotary table or kelly.\n\nThe well control system has a vital role during drilling. It is responsible for assuring\n\nthat no undesired flow of formation fluids occur during drilling and, if that happens, it\n\nhas to make sure that the situation doesn\u2019t evolve into a blowout when an uncontrolled\n\nflow of hydrocarbons reach the surface. Equipment such as Blowout Preventers (BOPs),\n\npit-volume indicators and flow indicators are part of the set of this system.\n\nThe well monitoring system is composed of all devices and equipment that have a\n\npart in the control of essential parameters in the rig such as well depth, hook load, and\n\npit level. In modern platforms, a centralized control unit is present at the engineer\u2019s office\n\nso that monitoring occurs during all times during drilling.\n\n1.1.5 Drilling rigs displacement\n\nIn marine environments, an important aspect when drilling is the rig displacement.\n\nSometimes environmental conditions can post a challenge for a rig to stay above the\n\nwell location. Vertical, horizontal and angular movements occur, especially in rough sea\n\nconditions. To minimize horizontal displacement anchoring and dynamic positioning system\n\nare good options. However, in water depths greater than 700 meters (MITCHELL; MISKA,\n\n2011), anchoring a floating rig is not recommended because of the weight of the chains and\n\nthe difficulty of installing without support vessels. As a solution for this problem, dynamic\n\npositioning (DP) is a system composed of a set of thrusters that counter the forces from\n\nthe marine currents measured by sensors. A control room inside the rig monitors the whole\n\nsystem.\n\nThe vertical movement, called \u2019heave\u201d, due to ocean waves is also a problem during\n\ndrilling operations. For the drilling to be efficient, the Weight On Bit (WOB) has to\n\n\n\n25\n\nremain constant. To compensate the vertical displacement a heave compensator is used\n\nand a pneumatic tensioning device on the traveling block maintains a constant hookload\n\n(MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011).\n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Types of displacement that an offshore rig can perform.\n\nSource: (PERERA; SANDARUWAN, 2009)\n\n1.1.6 Heave compensation systems\n\nThe main objective of a heave compensation system is to separate the vessel motion\n\nfrom the load motion, reducing the tension variation on the suspended structure. Woodacre\n\net al. (2015) makes a comprehensive review of the different mechanisms of vertical motion\n\nheave compensation systems. Two prevailing categories are passive and active heave\n\ncompensation systems.\n\nA passive heave compensation system is basically an equipment that isolates\n\nvibration. In order to attenuate the vessel motion and maintain a controlled displacement\n\nof the drillstring, a series of spring-damper sets are put between the rig and the suspended\n\ndrillstring. Figure 10 gives a simplistic schematic of a passive heave compensation system.\n\nA small vessel, a subject of heave displacement due to ocean currents, suspending a\n\nconcentrated load at the end of a line. The spring-damper symbolizes a passive heave\n\ncompensation system that attenuates the vibration from the vessel and transmits a lower\n\namplitude vibration to the load it carries. Passive heave compensators don\u2019t require energy\n\n\n\n26\n\nand have proved to serve as an important asset during drilling activities as suggested early\n\nin the seventies by Butler (1973).\n\nFigure 10 \u2013 A basic schematic of a vibration isolator such as a passive heave compensator.\n\nSource: (WOODACRE; BAUER; IRANI, 2015)\n\nThe active heave compensation systems use a control system that acts directly on\n\ncolumn weight variations, enabling operations under more severe environmental conditions\n\n(DO; PAN, 2008). Passive systems act when subjected to a variation of traction due to\n\nthe change of load suffered, acting as a kind of \u201dspring\u201d. In semi-active systems, there is a\n\ncombination of active and passive systems where an additional hydraulic force is applied\n\nto the latter to minimize friction losses and air pressure losses. The semi-active system\n\nconsumes less energy than the active system (MELLO; VAZ, 2004). The absence of a\n\nheave compensation system may jeopardize other activities not directly related to drilling,\n\nsuch as the control and operation of Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) or the exact\n\nlocation of equipment that has to be moved below the surface of the sea, besides causing\n\ngreat risks during drilling.\n\nDue to the high costs of drilling operations on large water depths, many studies\n\nhave focused on the development of heave compensation systems in order to mitigate\n\npossible damages that vertical riser oscillation from the platform could cause (CUELLAR,\n\n2014; DO; PAN, 2008).\n\nIn addition to the design of heave compensation systems, much attention is paid\n\nby the industry to the understanding of the riser\u2019s response to the vertical movement of\n\nthe platform. A major initiative of the industry was to develop systems of prediction of\n\nmovement of the riser. However, the major obstacle is to understand how the riser deforms\n\nwith the static and dynamic forces acting simultaneously on it (Marcio Yamamoto, 2011).\n\n\n\n27\n\n1.2 Drillstring\n\nThe drillstring consists on a string of steel tubes that are connected by threads.\n\nWhen the complete set is assembled, it forms a long and flexible structure. This tubing\n\nhas at its lower end a shorter and heavier segment composed of thicker ducts, called drill\n\ncollars, with a cutting interface at its free end, the drill bit (TUCKER; WANG, 1999a).\n\nThe function of the heavier pipes is to apply weight to the bit so that the formation is\n\ninvaded until the purpose of the drilling project is reached, usually an oil and / or gas\n\nreservoir.\n\nThe functions of the drillstring are (DAREING, 2012):\n\n\u2022 to transmit mechanical rotary power to the drill bit;\n\n\u2022 to circulate fluids;\n\n\u2022 to affect hole direction;\n\n\u2022 to apply force to drill bits.\n\nThe drillstring is mostly formed by drill pipes. There are drill collars at the lower\n\nportion and tools can be present, such as stabilizers, Measuring While Drilling (MWD),\n\ndrill bit, Positive Displacement Motor (PDM) and turbines.\n\nDrill pipes are designed to work while tensile is applied. In contrast, drill collars\n\nhave higher resistance to compression. The difference in physical parameters between drill\n\npipes and drill collars can be attenuated by placing heavy weight drill pipes between the\n\ntwo portions of pipe.\n\nThe pipes are connected by shouldered threaded couplings, called tool joints. These\n\ntools are used mainly to protect the coupling and to give an outside diameter offset so\n\nthat they are more easily lifted and suspended.\n\n\n\n28\n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Basic components of a drillstring.\n\nSource: (MITCHELL; MISKA, 2011; API, 2007).\n\n1.2.1 Mechanics\n\nDrillstring vibrations are a complex research subject. Many factors such as bit/formation\n\ninteraction, drillstring/wellbore interaction and hydraulics can influence drillstring dynamic\n\nbehavior. Associated with these types of vibration are phenomena that can substantially\n\ndecrease drilling performance like premature wear and damage of drilling equipment, and\n\nconsequent decrease in the rate of penetration (ROP) (AADNOY et al., 2009). The BHA is\n\nthe location in the drillstring where most of the excitations happen, and the pertaining drill\n\ncollars and adjacent heavyweight drill pipes have a higher probability of suffering damage\n\n\n\n29\n\ndue to vibrations. Although vibrations can generate adverse effects such as equipment\n\nfailure and well misdirection, there is research on benefits of axial vibration to drilling\n\n(XIAO; HURICH; BUTT, 2018a; XIAO; HURICH; BUTT, 2018b).Three primary modes\n\nof vibration exist during drilling: axial, torsional and lateral vibrations, as shown in Figure\n\n12.\n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Primary vibration modes of a drillstring.\n\nSource: (J.J. Azar; G. Robello Samuel, 2007).\n\nThe axial vibration consists of the oscillation along the longitudinal axis of the\n\ndrillstring. The source can be static or dynamic. The leading dynamic cause of axial\n\nvibrations is bit/formation interaction, especially in roller-cone bits (SKAUGEN, 1987).\n\nSymptoms such as kelly bounce and whipping of the drawworks cables at the rig can\n\nindicate axial vibrations (DAREING, 1984). The severity of the vibration can induce a\n\nfluctuation in WOB decreasing the ROP as a consequence (AADNOY et al., 2009).\n\nAxial vibrations may cause bit-bounce, a phenomenon where the bit temporarily\n\nlifts from the bottom ceasing to interact with the formation to, later, impact the bottom\n\nof the well. Bit-bounce may cause bit wear, excessive vibration, a decrease in ROP and\n\nworse drilling performances.\n\n\n\n30\n\nTorsional vibration relates to angular motion along the drillstring longitudinal axis.\n\nA constant ROP on the surface does not transmit correctly to the bit because of the\n\ntorsional flexibility of the drillstring. This type of vibration can be transient, where the\n\noscillation occurs at specific points in the drillstring, and steady-state, that happens for\n\na longer time interval. It relates to a common drilling problem called \u201dstick-slip\u201d. This\n\nmotion consists of a very low angular velocity, or complete standstill, of the bit while the\n\ntubes accumulate energy and a sudden release of energy making the bit rotate as fast as\n\nten times the original angular velocity. This phenomenon can cause extensive bit wear,\n\nfatigue and even failure of drillstring equipment (AADNOY et al., 2009).\n\nLateral vibrations also called bending, transverse and flexural vibrations, are\n\nthe leading cause of drillstring failure. Bit/formation interaction, drillstring/borehole\n\ninteraction and an initially bent BHA can cause this type of vibration. A consequence\n\nof lateral vibration is drillstring whirling, a centrifugal induced bowing of the drillstring\n\nduring bit rotation (VANDIVER; NICHOLSON; SHYU, 1990), this effect can be forward,\n\nbackward or chaotic. Figure 13 shows the nature of this motion where the center of mass\n\nmoves from the drillstring longitudinal axis. This effect may lead to a range of phenomena\n\nthat result in equipment failures such as abrasion of drill collars external walls, connections\n\nfatigue and a decrease in ROP. Since the BHA is always subject to compression, this\n\nsection has a higher tendency of suffering from buckling and whirling (AADNOY et al.,\n\n2009).\n\n\n\n31\n\nFigure 13 \u2013 Drill collar whirling.\n\nSource: (VANDIVER; NICHOLSON; SHYU, 1990).\n\nIn practice, the study of drillstring mechanics involve the three main types of\n\nvibration separately together with a range of effects. These effects can be linear and\n\nparametrical coupling between axial, lateral and torsional vibrations (GHASEMLOONIA;\n\nGeoff Rideout; BUTT, 2014a), bit-bounce, backward and forward whirl and stick-slip.\n\nCoupling mechanisms occur and increase the complexity of the drillstring dynamic behavior\n\nsubstantially.\n\n1.3 State-of-the-art\n\nPrevious research has focused on multiple aspects of the drillstring dynamic be-\n\nhavior as mentioned in literature reviews addressing vibrations, modeling, and failure\n\n(ZHU; TANG; YANG, 2014; GHASEMLOONIA; Geoff Rideout; BUTT, 2015; ALBDIRY;\n\nALMENSORY, 2016). As a general rule, the BHA is the location that suffers the most\n\nwith vibration (DAREING, 1984).\n\nGHASEMLOONIA et al. (2015) makes a review on earlier works related to drill-\n\nstring vibrations modeling and shows the most significant research on drillstring behavior\n\n\n\n32\n\npredictions and vibrations mitigation. The literature review until the end of the research\n\nperiod will follow the works mentioned in the publication.\n\nKHULIEF (2005) developed a dynamic model of the drillstring including drill pipes\n\nand drill collars. The shaft elements used had 12 degrees of freedom each. The gravitational\n\nforce field, the coupling between torsional and bending inertia and the gyroscopic effect\n\nwere considered. The author used a consistent mass matrix and the explicit method to\n\nstudy the structure of dynamic behavior. Later, KHULIEF (2007) performed the analysis\n\nof the stick-slip effect by coupling axial and bending degrees of freedom while adding\n\nstick-slip self-excited oscillations.\n\nTUCKER (1999b) developed a numerical model that covers all modes of vibration\n\nin an integrated system which was composed of Bottom Hole Assembly (BHA) and drill\n\npipes. In the analysis, the element used had 6 degrees of freedom. The research addressed\n\nthe oscillating friction between bit and formation (bit bouncing) and helical buckling of\n\nthe drillstring.\n\nExperiments suggest that the drillstring reacts in diverse ways when changing\n\noperating parameters such as torque, drag force, temperature and weight on bit. CHENG\n\n(2011) assembled an experiment to measure the forces acting on the bit and BHA through\n\na dynamic force sensor that measures axial, lateral and rotational forces.\n\nKAPITANIAK (2015) assembled and experimental rig with commercial drill bits\n\nand rock-samples. Several types of phenomena could be studied, such as stick-slip, whirling,\n\nbit-bounce and helical buckling. A finite element model was developed using shaft elements.\n\nThe results showed convergence between the experiment and the model, especially during\n\nstick-slip oscillations.\n\nNiedzwecki &amp; Thampi (1988) studied the dynamic behavior of long drillstrings\n\nsubjected to the heave movement of the platform, compensated by a passive system\n\ninstalled in the platform-column drilling interface. The sensitivity of the string to different\n\nenvironmental loading scenarios was evaluated through the dynamic amplitude, the phase\n\nangle and the dimensionless voltage ratio. Through this study, it became clear the need for\n\na heave compensation system to minimize vertical oscillation during drilling operations.\n\nEl-Hawary &amp; Mbamalu (1996) developed robust estimation techniques for underwa-\n\nter motion compensation. Cuellar &amp; Fortaleza (2014), developed a hydropneumatic heave\n\ncompensation system together with a semi-active control system for 6 km depth drillings.\n\nThe objective was to maintain the performance of the drilling with the constant change of\n\n\n\n33\n\nthe mass of the drillstring due to the action of the environmental agents on the platform.\n\nThrough the said system, more robust, they obtained a good result in the compensation\n\nof the heave.\n\nThere is a recent interest in the application of axial vibrations to increase ROP\n\nand consequently drill wells more efficiently (GHASEMLOONIA; Geoff Rideout; BUTT,\n\n2014b).\n\nStudies were carried out on the dynamics of the drillstring, the heave movement of\n\nthe platform and the heave compensation systems currently used. However, few studies\n\nhave been carried out on the effect of the heave movement of floating platforms with\n\ncompensation system installed in the sum of vibrations of the drillstring.\n\n1.4 Problem description\n\nThe fatigue caused by vibrations in drillstrings is a primary motive for equipment\n\nfailure during drilling operations. Previous works addressed various aspects of drillstring\n\nvibrations, but the study of heave contribution was not particularly made. The input of\n\nan oscillatory motion to the top of the drillstring may affect axial tension in the structure\n\nin different ways, and changes in the modal behavior should occur.\n\n1.5 Research objective\n\nThe objective of this work is to study the contribution of heave motion from\n\nenvironmental loads in offshore platforms to drillstring dynamic behavior using finite\n\nelement analysis. Natural frequencies and vibration modes will be calculated as a function\n\nof parameters such as wave amplitude and frequency.\n\n\n\n34\n\n2 THE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD\n\n2.1 Concept\n\nFinite element method (FEM) is a mathematical tool used in many fields such as\n\nheat transfer, electromagnetism, fluid mechanics and structural analysis. The primary\n\nfocus of this research in on structural analysis. Given the existence of a physical problem,\n\nthe use of the method creates the possibility of predicting complex structure behavior\n\nconsidering different geometries and loads in a static or dynamic environment.\n\nEvery physical problem can be simplified by a mathematical model. A mathematical\n\nmodel is a set of governing differential equations that determine the system behavior that\n\nassumes parameters such as geometry, kinematics and physical laws that apply to the\n\nproblem. The process of solving these equations for every point in the domain is called\n\nanalytical solution.\n\nReal problems, however, tend to have complex mathematical models that make it\n\nsolving analytically almost impossible. The finite element method comes as a tool (one of\n\nmany) that bypasses this problem. By breaking down the structure in \u201dfinite elements,\u201d\n\nor discretizing the structure, each element has a set of simpler algebraic equations that\n\ndetermine its governing behavior. Between elements, there are \u201dnodes.\u201d Each node has\n\ntypes of movement it can perform. Those types of displacement, linear or angular, are\n\ncalled degrees of freedom.\n\nThe mesh or grid is the discretized structure; its refinement determines the accuracy\n\nof the approximated solution. The mesh generates a significant number of linear equations\n\nthat are solvable by a matrix approach. After creating the mesh, it is necessary to set\n\ndisplacement restrictions or boundary conditions. Boundary conditions enable eliminating\n\nsome rows and columns of the solution matrix, making the system solvable. Usually, in\n\nstructural analysis, the nodes displacement are the solution, and different parameters are\n\nobtainable from the displacement values such as stress and strain on the nodes degrees of\n\nfreedom for the entire mesh. Figure 14 displays the usual path of a simulation.\n\n\n\n35\n\nFigure 14 \u2013 Usual path to a finite element analysis.\n\nSource: Modified from (BATHE, 2006).\n\nThe model generates approximated numerical solutions for every degree of freedom\n\nof the system. The results may have satisfying accuracy or not; it\u2019s the responsibility of\n\nthe engineer to determine the degree of error for the model. If it does not satisfy, it\u2019s\n\n\n\n36\n\npossible to refine the model and to generate a new mesh with more elements or, even, to\n\nchange the mathematical model for the physical problem.\n\nThe most valuable characteristics of the finite element method are efficiency and\n\nreliability, especially after the advent of digital computers. Although FEM is a great tool,\n\nthe process depends on the mathematical model, if the numerical model doesn\u2019t represent\n\nto a certain extent the system behavior, the solution using FEM won\u2019t be able to deliver\n\nreliable results (BATHE, 2006).\n\n2.2 Static analysis\n\nThe negative values relate to the displacement subtraction of The finite element\n\nmethod is an excellent approach to both static and dynamic problems. For the static\n\npart, the use of the technique is much more straightforward. Equation 1 gives the general\n\napproach to static problems in structural analysis.\n\nKx = F (1)\n\nIn Equation 1, K represents the stiffness matrix, x represents the displacement\n\nvector and F the load vector. It\u2019s clear the relationship of the static problem with the\n\ngeneral linear spring equation. The stiffness parameter will have a different formula for\n\neach degree of freedom.\n\nFor all analysis during the research period, the two-dimensional beam is the chosen\n\nfinite element. The beam element has eight degrees of freedom: axial, shear, flexural and\n\ntorsional for each node. Figure 15 shows the beam element for the example.\n\nFigure 15 \u2013 Beam element with eight degrees of freedom.\n\nu\nv ?\n\n?\n\nSource: Nicolau Oyhenard dos Santos (2018)\n\n\n\n37\n\nEquations 2, 3 and 4 set the uncoupled behavior of the degrees of freedom corre-\n\nsponding to axial, shear, bend and torsion, respectively.

Matrix rows and columns 2 and 5 concern the degree of freedom due to\n\nshear. In the stiffness matrix, rows and columns 3 and 6 represent bending and rows and\n\ncolumns 4 and 8 represent the angular degree of freedom corresponding to torsion.

There are two types of\n\ndynamic analysis: on the frequency domain and on the time domain. Equation 10 shows\n\nthe general equation for dynamic analysis in time domain.\n\nMx? + Cx? + Kx = F(t) (10)\n\nEquation 10 has a few additional parameters, M stands for the mass matrix, C\n\nis the damping matrix, x? and x? are the first and second derivatives of the displacement,\n\ni.e., velocity and acceleration. The variation with time demands the input of the inertia\n\nparameter, the mass matrix, and the damping parameter.\n\n\n\n40\n\nThe linear dynamic response of a system depends on three types of forces: inertia\n\nforces, damping forces and elastic forces. All of them are time-dependent. The same\n\nequation can be used for static analysis as long as inertia and damping forces are neglected.\n\nIt\u2019s the job of the engineer to provide justification for the choice of which type\n\nof analysis to perform. The analyst suffers from the risk of performing useless work.\n\nParticularly to nonlinear problems, this is critical.\n\nEquation 10 represents, mathematically, a system of linear differential equations\n\nof second order that can be solved by conventional methods using constant coefficients.\n\nHowever, this approach is not applicable when very large matrices are involved.\n\nThe mass matrix for the beam element is of the same size as the stiffness matrix,\n\nfour rows and four columns for each node. The matrix can be lumped or consistent.\n\nEquation 11 shows the lumped matrix for the beam element. Equation 12 represent the\n\nconsistent mass matrix for the beam element (Marcio Yamamoto, 2011).\n\nML =\n\n?\n??????????????????????????????\n\nmL\n\n2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0\nmL\n\n2\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0\n?JL\n\n2\n0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0\nmL\n\n2\n0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\nmL\n\n2\n0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n?JL\n\n2\n\n?\n??????????????????????????????\n\n(11)\n\n\n\n41\n\nMC =\nmL\n\n420\n\n?\n????????????????????\n\n140 0 0 0 70 0 0 0\n\n0 156 22L 0 0 54 ?13L 0\n\n0 22L 4L2 0 0 13L ?3L2 0\n\n0 0 0\n140?J\n\nm\n0 0 0\n\n70?J\n\nm\n\n70 0 0 0 140 0 0 0\n\n0 54 13L 0 0 156 ?22L 0\n\n0 ?13L ?3L2 0 0 ?22L 4L2 0\n\n0 0 0\n70?J\n\nm\n0 0 0\n\n140?J\n\nm\n\n?\n????????????????????\n\n(12)\n\nIn the equations above, ? stands for specific mass in [kg/m3], m is the distributed\n\nmass per unit of length in [kg/m].\n\nThe damping matrix is assembled by a combination of the stiffness and mass\n\nmatrices using Rayleigh\u2019s coefficients (CLOUGH; PENZIEN, 2013).

What an usual time analysis does is to impose\n\nequilibrium between inertia, damping and elastic forces to the system subjected to external\n\nforces (Equation 10) for each time step regarding a total analysis time and a particular\n\ntime discretization.\n\n\n\n45\n\nThere are numerical methods that can do this type of integration, two of these are:\n\ndirect integration and mode superposition. Although a little different, these two methods\n\nare closely related.\n\nIn the case of direct integration methods, the word \u201ddirect\u201d corresponds to the fact\n\nthat no transformation is performed on the equations prior to the step-by-step numerical\n\nprocedure. One of the important aspect of these methods is that system equilibrium is only\n\nsought for specific points in time rather than for the entire time interval. Another important\n\naspect is that a variation of displacements, velocities and accelerations is assumed and\n\nthis contributes to the solution accuracy and stability.\n\nThe solution of the equilibrium equations for dynamic analysis performed by direct\n\nintegration can happen by applying explicit or implicit methods. The explicit method\n\ncalculates the solution for a particular discrete time point t + ?t based on the equilibrium\n\nequations of the previous time point t. The implicit method, however, obtains the solution\n\nfor t + ?t based on the equilibrium equations for time t + ?t as shown in Equation 17.\n\nAnother difference between the implicit and explicit method is the dependency of the\n\nlatter on the size of the time step used in the analysis.\n\nt+?tKU + t+?tCU? + t+?tMU? = t+?tR (17)\n\nThis research focused on a particular implicit method called Newmark Method. It is a\n\nwidely used numerical integration method for structure analysis. Being one the most\n\nused methods in finite element analysis, it solves differential equations that describe the\n\ndynamic behavior of solids and structures, as well as other systems. Equations 18 and\n\n19 represent the formulas used to obtain velocities and displacements in the Newmark\n\nmethod. By isolating t+?tU?, accelerations are obtained (NEWMARK, 1959).\n\nt+?tU? = tU? + [(1 ? ?) tU? + ? t+?tU?]?t (18)\n\nt+?tU = tU + tU??t +\n\n[(\n1\n\n2\n??\n\n)\ntU? + ? t+?tU?\n\n]\n?t2 (19)\n\nThe parameters ? and ? can vary according to the necessary accuracy and stability\n\nfor the analysis. This work adopted the constant-average-acceleration method, where ? = 1\n2\n\nand ? = 1\n4\n, known for being unconditionally stable (NEWMARK, 1959).\n\n\n\n46\n\nTo validate the application of the finite element method to dynamic analysis in the\n\ntime domain, an example from (BATHE, 2006) was used. Equation 20 shows the governing\n\nequilibrium equations for the example.?\n?2 0\n\n0 1\n\n?\n?\n?\n?U?1\nU?2\n\n?\n? +\n\n?\n? 6 ?2\n?2 4\n\n?\n?\n?\n?U1\nU2\n\n?\n? =\n\n?\n? 0\n\n10\n\n?\n? (20)\n\nThe solution of the system with two degrees of freedom was obtained for a sequence of 12\n\ntime steps. The time step for the solution was 0.28 seconds. Figure 20 shows the solution\n\nobtained for the first and second degrees of freedom as well as the numerical solution\n\nobtained by the use of the Newmark Method.\n\nFigure 20 \u2013 Comparison of results with data from Example 9.4 in (BATHE, 2006).\n\nSource: Nicolau Oyhenard dos Santos (2018)\n\nApart from the example in the literature, a more realistic model was assembled in\n\norder to show and validate the algorithm for solving dynamic systems.

To impose a displacement\n\nto the drillstring, wave data (PIANCA; MAZZINI; SIEGLE, 2010), was used directly\n\nas motion amplitude and period on the top of the drillstring. The research could have\n\nused only a portion of the wave amplitude representing a passive heave compensation\n\nsystem, but since the average values were low, it was decided to not consider a motion\n\ncompensation. This work considered average wave amplitudes and periods for all seasons\n\nof the year in Santos Basin, Brazil. Figure 28 demonstrates the varying wave behavior\n\nacross the year taking an average of the wave amplitudes and periods.\n\n\n\n54\n\nFigure 28 \u2013 The 4 types of displacement used as input for the model.\n\nSource: Nicolau Oyhenard dos Santos (2018)\n\n4.2 Normal Forces Distribution\n\nNormal forces in a drillstring is maximum at its top and minimum at the bottom,\n\nwhere it turns negative because of the change from a tensioned system to a compressed\n\nsystem. The amount of compressive force above the bit is also called Weight on Bit (WOB)\n\nand is a paramount parameter for every drlling operation.\n\nEquation 23 displays all forces considered in this model. Table 9 explains the\n\nparameters in Equation 23.\n\nF = Fg + Fp + T (23)\n\nForce Explanation\nFg Hoisting system\nFp Distributed weight\nT Axial Tension\nF Total force\n\nTable 9 \u2013 Forces present on each element of the system\n\n\n\n55\n\nTaking into account Equation 23 and replacing F in Equation 24, Equation 25 can\n\nbe used to calculate the tension on the drillstring. After calculating MU?, axial tension is\n\ncalculated.\n\nMU? + CU? + KU = F(t) (24)\n\nT = Fp ?Fg + MU? (25)\n\nFigure 29 shows the variation of normal forces considering an static case. When\n\nconsidering only the weight of the drillstring and the force due to the hoisting system of\n\nthe platform, most of the drillstring suffers tension while at the bottom the string is on a\n\ncompressive state.\n\nNormal forces on the drillstring vary from the static example because of the inertia\n\neffect. Neutral point is the location where axial stress is zero. If you cut the line at this\n\npoint, no difference in weight will be felt during suspension of the string.\n\nFigure 29 \u2013 Normal forces distribution considering only the weight and the hoisting force.\n\nSource: Nicolau Oyhenard dos Santos (2018)\n\n\n\n56\n\n4.3 Dynamic Model\n\nAfter performing and validating static and dynamic analysis, the research focused\n\non a more realistic model of a drillstring. Two models were considered: a hanging structure\n\nand a structure fixed at the bottom.\n\nThe program structure to perform the dynamic analysis consisted of:\n\n1. Input data such as drillstring length, time of analysis, time step and number of finite\n\nelements;\n\n2. Assembling of organizing matrices based upon boundary conditions and input data\n\n(Thomas J. R. Hughes, 1987);\n\n3. Mass matrix assembling;\n\n4.

Obtention of dimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to the degree\n\nof freedom of shear (time dependent).\n\n5. Output data\n\n\n\n57\n\nTaking into consideration the dynamic simulation of the drillstrings, the axial\n\nforce due to the drawworks was 0.02 the weight of the whole structure subtracted by the\n\nbuoyancy on seawater to maintain a tension-compression relationship in the drillstring\n\nnecessary for all drilling operations.\n\nThe model contemplated 4 scenarios of platform heave motion as seen in Figure 28\n\n(PIANCA; MAZZINI; SIEGLE, 2010). The first scenario had a heave response amplitude\n\nof 1.5 meters and wave excitation of 11 seconds, the second scenario had a heave response\n\namplitude of 2 meters and wave excitation of 11 seconds, the third scenario had a heave\n\nresponse amplitude of 2.5 m and wave excitation of 11 s and the fourth scenario considered\n\na heave response amplitude of 1.5 m and wave excitation of 7 s. The drillstring model\n\nconsidered for the analysis was a 1000 meters long composed only of drillpipes, heavyweight\n\ndrillpipes and drillcollars. Table 4.3 presents the parameters used for the different sections\n\nin the drillstring (LYONS; PLISGA, 2005).\n\nTubing type Drillpipe HW drillpipe Drillcollar\n\nSection length (L) 800 m 100 m 100 m\nYoung\u2019s modulus (E) 210.109 Pa 210.109 Pa 210.109 Pa\nOutside diameter (OD) 6 5\n\n8\nin 4 1\n\n2\nin 5 in\n\nInside diameter (ID) 5.901 in 2.25 in 2.25 in\nSpecific mass (?) 7860 kg/m3 7860 kg/m3 7860 kg/m3\n\nShear modulus (G) 80.109 Pa 80.109 Pa 80.109 Pa\n\nTable 10 \u2013 Data respective to all different sections in the structure.\n\nAll analysis had a total time of 50 seconds and a time step size of 0.05 seconds. To\n\nshow the convergence of numerical results for the displacements, velocities and accelerations\n\nusing the Newmark method, the first excitation period was removed because of transient\n\nbehavior of data. For better visualization numerical results for the displacements, velocities\n\nand acceleration were shown for the first 30 seconds of analysis. The wave periods are\n\nhighlighted by different background colors on the graphs.\n\n4.3.1 Hanging Structure\n\nFigure 30 displays a simplified diagram of the drillstring for the first dynamic\n\nmodel. Only one boundary condition is present, a prescribed displacement at the top node\n\nrepresenting the heave displacement of the rig. The lower end of the drillstring is free to\n\n\n\n58\n\nmove. This model represents a drillstring being lowered or raised with its whole length\n\ninside the riser.\n\nFigure 30 \u2013 Simplified diagram of dynamic model of drillstring.\n\nDrillpipes\n\nDrillcollars\n\nHoisting Force\n\nWeight\n\nHeavyweight drillpipes\n\n0.8L\n\n0.1L\n\n0.1L\n\nL\n\nHeave displacement\n\nFree to move\n\nSource: Nicolau Oyhenard dos Santos (2018)\n\nVertical displacement and axial force variation on the top node of the drillstring,\n\nshown in Figure 31, prove coherent physical behavior of the drillstring. The axial force\n\nvariation with time shows an alternation between states of tension and compression at\n\nthe top of the structure. Although small considering the much greater weight of the\n\ndrillstring, the axial force variation states that when the string is being lowered due to the\n\ndisplacement at the top the structure enters in a compressive state showing a negative\n\naxial force. When the vertical displacement is positive the drillstring enters in a state of\n\ntension. This behavior appears even when the drillstring has no physical link at its lower\n\nend evidencing the elastic behavior of the long structure made of fortified steel.\n\nSince the structure is hanging with its lower end free to move, the displacement\n\nrelative to time for the entire drillstring was equivalent. The amplitude and period of\n\n\n\n59\n\nexcitation at the top have been displayed in all nodes of the discretized model with a slight\n\ndifference in amplitude due to the elastic behavior of the slender structure.\n\nFigure 31 \u2013 Vertical displacement and axial force variation on the top node.\n\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nD\nis\n\npl\nac\n\nem\nen\n\nt (\nm\n\n)\n\n10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50\nTime (s)\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\nA\nxi\n\nal\n fo\n\nrc\ne \n\n(N\n)\n\nSource: Nicolau Oyhenard dos Santos (2018)\n\nAlthough until this point the validation has accompanied all the models, to validate\n\nthis model data from active rigs such as hoisting force in the draw works system, drillstring\n\nweight and compensated rig displacement would be necessary for validation. This research\n\nproposes the obtention of rig data from the industry and comparison with results obtained\n\nby the finite element analysis to validate this model.\n\n4.3.2 Fixed Structure\n\nPosterior to the analysis of the drillstring in a hanging situation, a new analysis\n\nwas made to the same structure fixed at the bottom. This new problem can be classified\n\nas a boundary-value problem since no vertical displacement occurs at the lower end, but\n\nan imposed displacement is passed at the top end of the string.\n\nThe direct integration through the Newmark method allows the obtention of\n\ndisplacements, velocities, and acceleration for every node of the model. These values are\n\n\n\n60\n\nnecessary for calculating the axial forces for each time step in every element. As explained\n\nbefore, the geometric stiffness matrix is dependent on the axial force on every element.\n\nThe analysis considered all four scenarios of heave displacement obtaining the\n\ndimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to the degrees of freedom of axial, shear\n\nand torsion. The axial and torsional behavior is not dependent on the tensioned or\n\ncompressed state of the structure so they were obtained only at the initial time step of\n\nthe analysis.\n\nThe variation of the dimensionless natural frequencies corresponding to the degree\n\nof freedom of shear is shown for all scenarios.\n\nFigure 32 \u2013 Simplified diagram of dynamic model of drillstring.\n\nSource: Nicolau Oyhenard dos Santos (2018)\n\nScenario 1: Heave response amplitude 1.5 m, wave excitation 11 s\n\nThe first scenario considered a harmonic vertical displacement at the top node\n\nof 1.5 meters of amplitude and 11 seconds of the natural period. Figure 4.3.2 shows 4\n\n\n\n61\n\nsubplots, the first one representing the imposed displacement at the top, the second (to\n\nthe right) showing the displacement numerically obtained for a node at the middle of the\n\nstring and the last two graphs show the velocity and acceleration variation. The time scale\n\nused, 11 to 30 seconds, in the graphs is a smaller portion of a longer analysis to show\n\nthe correct behavior of displacements, velocities, and accelerations and to validate the\n\ndynamic analysis one more time.\n\nFigure 33 \u2013 Numerical results for an axial degree of freedom in the middle of the structure\non Scenario 1.\n\n1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0\n\n- 1 . 5\n\n- 1 . 0\n\n- 0 . 5\n\n0 . 0\n\n0 . 5\n\n1 . 0\n\n1 . 5\n\nHe\nav\n\ne (\nm)\n\nT i m e  ( s )\n1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0\n\n- 0 . 8\n\n- 0 . 6\n\n- 0 . 4\n\n- 0 . 2\n\n0 . 0\n\n0 . 2\n\n0 . 4\n\n0 . 6\n\n0 . 8\nDi\n\nspl\nace\n\nme\nnt \n\n(m\n)\n\nT i m e  ( s )\n\n1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0\n\n- 0 . 4\n\n- 0 . 2\n\n0 . 0\n\n0 . 2\n\n0 . 4\n\nVe\nloc\n\nity\n (m\n\n/s)\n\nT i m e  ( s )\n1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0\n\n- 0 . 2\n\n0 . 0\n\n0 . 2\n\nT i m e  ( s )\n\nAc\ncel\n\nera\ntio\n\nn (\nm/\n\ns2 )\n\nSource: Nicolau Oyhenard dos Santos (2018)\n\nThe graphs show results starting from the second period due to the transient\n\nbehavior of the initial seconds of analysis.

(2018)\n\nAs seen in the four different scenarios of heave motion that an offshore rig may\n\nbe subjected to, the model shows good convergence when comparing axial displacements,\n\nvelocities, and accelerations of a node in the middle of the structure, acquired through the\n\nuse of the Newmark method and the Dirichlet boundary conditions technique.\n\nAlso, the neutral point displacements are periodic and in accordance with heave\n\ndata. Results also incorporate the variation of the normal forces along the drillstring with\n\ntime.\n\nDimensionless natural frequencies for the degree of freedom corresponding to shear\n\nwere obtained. Results show periodicity when comparing every wave excitation. The\n\nbehavior of the natural frequencies can be associated with a nonlinear behavior of slender\n\nstructures when subjected to periodic loading such as marine drift.\n\nThe complete nonlinear behavior of the drillstring even now is studied by companies\n\nand academia. This dynamic model could only be validated if the actual behavior of the\n\ndrillstring could be summarized with the present considerations. The research intends on\n\n\n\n73\n\ncontinuing with the goal of approaching a closer dynamic model of the drillstring that\n\ncould be used by companies in order to predict and prevent excessive vibrations when\n\ndrilling offshore.\n\n\n\n74\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS\n\nAn increasing complexity approach was adopted to apply accurately the finite\n\nelement method for drilling operations. An static example of a slender structure with\n\na weight applied to the bottom and a distributed transverse force was simulated and\n\ncompared to existing literature. Natural frequencies and vibration modes were acquired\n\nand validated.\n\nDynamic analysis in both time and frequency domain showed good convergence\n\nand accurate results when compared with analytic calculations. A varying distribution\n\nof normal forces with time due to the inertia effect was adopted and the behavior of a\n\ndrillstring along a time interval was studied.\n\nA finite element model of a drillstring considering an oscillatory movement on the\n\ntop node simulating the heave displacement of an offshore rig was produced. Natural\n\nfrequencies variation were obtained considering different types of heave environments.\n\nAdditionally, neutral point displacement was obtained.\n\nThe validation of the final model could be realized through a comparison of data\n\nwhen the drillstring is being lowered or raised. The validation of the model when the\n\nstructure is fixed is impossible with data from the industry due to the lack of important\n\nparameters such as rotation, ocean force, friction, impacts to the well, heave compensation\n\nmechanisms, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects.\n\nA higher discretization of the structure would allow a better visualization of neutral\n\npoint position across time. High performance computing is an important step in continuing\n\nto study the drillstring, specially when facing nonlinear factor such as friction and impacts\n\nto the well bore.\n\nThe author intends to increase the complexity of this final model by adding\n\nhydrostatic and hydrodynamic effects to the drillstring, angular velocity, marine loading\n\nand a limit to drillstring displacement when simulating a drillstring inside a well.\n\n\n\n75\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nAADNOY, B.
