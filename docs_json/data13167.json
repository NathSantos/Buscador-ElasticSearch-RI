PIMENTEL*\n\nABSTRACT\n\nAge determinations using the 235U and 238U radioactive decay series to the daughter isotopes 207Pb and 206Pb,\n\nrespectively, using the mineral zircon (ZrSiO4), are widely used to decipher geological processes. A new method\n\ndeveloped in the last couple of years, the laser ablation multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry\n\n(LA-MC-ICP-MS), overcomes previous laborious sample preparation, and yields isotopic ratios and age data with a\n\nhigh spatial resolution of ten of microns. The present study describes the analytical set-up and data reduction process\n\nas presently applied at the Laboratory for Geochronology of the University of Bras\u00edlia. It explores the precision and\n\naccuracy of the method by cross-analysing three international zircon standards. We arrive at a precision of 1.9 to 3.7%\n\n(2? SD) and an accuracy of 0.6 to 3.8% (2? SD) for and U isotopic ratios of the standards. We also apply the method\n\nto two natural zircon samples, which have previously been dated by other analytical methods. A comparison of the\n\nresults shows a good conformity of the age data, being within the error limits. The data demonstrate the great analytical\n\npotential of the method for rapid, precise and accurate U-Pb isotopic analyses on the micron scale.\n\nKey words: geochronology, U-Pb isotopes, LA-MC-ICP-MS, zircon, age dating.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAbsolute age determinations in the geosciences serve\nfor a variety of applications including geotectonic stud-\nies, sedimentation ages and sediment provenance, as\nwell as dating of igneous and metamorphic rocks. They\nuse the decay of a radioactive isotope in a natural min-\neral with a half-life favourable for the expected age of\nthe material or process investigated. Many of these\napplications are conducted in materials of considerable\nage (millions to billions of years), which suggests the\nuse of the radioactive uranium isotopes 235U and 238U\nwith half-lifes of 7.04 \u00d7 108 and 4.47 \u00d7 109 years,\nand the radiogenic daughter isotopes 207Pb and 206Pb,\n\n*Member Academia Brasileira de Ci\u00eancias\nCorrespondence to: Bernhard B\u00fchn\nE-mail: berbu@unb.br\n\nrespectively. Analysis of the parent and daughter iso-\ntopes allows the determination of the crystallization age\nof the mineral. The mineral analysed should show cer-\ntain physicochemically favourable characteristics, such\nas high resistance to chemical exchange and recrystal-\nlization, and reasonably high U and radiogenic Pb con-\ntents for analysis, amongst others. These are met by\nthe abundantly occurring mineral zircon (ZrSiO4) which\nis, therefore, the most traditional and widely used min-\neral for age determinations of various geological appli-\ncations (e.g. Garbe-Sch\u00f6nberg and Arpe 1997, Ko\u0161ler et\nal. 2002).\n\nApart from the improvement in precision, accuracy\nand mass resolution on the detector side of the instru-\nmental set-up, a new method of material sampling is\ngaining more and more importance.

The technique is referred\nto as \u201claser ablation inductively coupled mass spectro-\nmetry\u201d (LA-ICP-MS). It avoids the laborious sample\ncleaning, dissolution and element separation in an ultra-\nclean laboratory environment required by the traditional\nisotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry\n(ID-TIMS). Since the pioneering work by Feng et al.\n(1993) and Hirata and Nesbitt (1995), significant analyt-\nical progress of the LA-ICP-MS method was achieved\n(see Vanhaecke and Moens 1999, G\u00fcnther et al. 2000,\nHorn et al. 2000, Stirling et al. 2000, Simonetti et al.\n2006, Paquette and Tiepolo 2007, Simon et al. 2007).\n\nIn this study, advances of this particular dating\nmethod, the multi-collector inductively coupled plasma\nmass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS) coupled to a laser\nmicroprobe, which has recently been set up at the Geo-\nchronology Laboratory of the University of Brasilia, are\nreported. We present results of three international zir-\ncon standards cross-calibrated one against the other, and\ntwo natural zircon samples which have previously been\nanalysed by other analytical methods. The data demon-\nstrate the capacity of the method in terms of rapid, pre-\ncise and accurate U and Pb isotope analyses with high\nspatial resolution.\n\nRATIONALE\n\nFor the case of two radioactive isotopes of a single el-\nement, as for the decay systems of 238U and 235U, the\nratios between the stable decay products and the radio-\nactive parent isotopes (206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U) are\ninterrelated. Given closed-system conditions, they plot\non a curve which extends from today towards the forma-\ntion of the Earth and the solar system at approximately\n4.53 Ga ago (Fig. 1). The ratios have to concord one to\nthe other following the relationship:\n\n206Pb\n238U\n\n=\n( 207Pb\n\n235U\n+ 1\n\n)?238U/?235U\n? 1 (1)\n\nand define the \u201cConcordia curve\u201d, with ? being the decay\nconstant of the respective radioactive isotope. Another\n\nage information can be obtained by the 207Pb/206Pb age,\nbased on the relationship:\n\n207Pb\n206Pb\n\n=\n235U\n238U\n\n\u00d7\n(e?235U\u00d7t ? 1)\n\n(e?238U\u00d7t ? 1)\n(2)\n\nWith the constant present-day 238U/235U ratio of 137.88,\nthis age information considers only the daughter iso-\ntopes. Hence, the more accurate and valid age infor-\nmation is obtained from the 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U\nisotope ratios.\n\nConcordia curve\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n207Pb/ 235U\n\n2\n0\n\n6\nP\n\nb\n/2\n\n3\n8 U\n\nDiscordia line\n\nwith concordant \nanalyses \n\nwith discordant\nanalyses \n\ndisplacement\ntowards common\nPb contributions\n\n4000 Ma\n\n3000 Ma\n\n1000 Ma\n\nupper\nintercept\n\nlower intercept\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Principles of the Concordia diagram 207Pb/235U versus\n206Pb/238U. Concordant analyses fall on the Concordia curve. Min-\n\nerals with a contribution of common Pb to the bulk Pb content plot\n\nbelow the Concordia curve. Lead loss leads to zircon analyses plot-\n\nting on a Discordia line with the upper intercept indicating the age of\n\ncrystallization.\n\nThere are two fundamental problems with this\nmethod. Firstly, the material analysed may contain ini-\ntial common Pb of non-radiogenic origin. The non-\nradiogenic Pb fraction displaces the isotope analyses to-\nwards values below the Concordia curve (Fig. 1). The\nproblem of this \u201ccommon Pb\u201d content can be resolved\nby correction procedures using crustal 206Pb/204Pb and\n207Pb/204Pb compositions. These Pb isotope ratios, how-\never, change with time in terrestrial materials, due to the\nradiogenic growth of 206Pb and 207Pb from the decay\nof 238U and 235U, respectively. The respective, time-\ndependant isotope ratio used for correction may be cal-\nculated from the average crustal Pb isotopic composi-\ntion, or may directly be analysed in cogenetic minerals\nwhich contain predominantly common, and little radio-\ngenic Pb.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2009) 81 (1)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/2/5 \u2014 13:57 \u2014 page 101 \u2014 #3\n\nPb AND U ISOTOPE ANALYSIS BY LA-MC-ICP-MS 101\n\nIn order to avoid these corrections, it is always more\neffective to analyse minerals which, due to their crystal\nlattice characteristics, contain sufficient U to analyse the\nparent and the daughter isotope but, on the other hand,\ndo not accommodate common Pb in the structure, be-\ncause of the mismatch between ionic charge and effec-\ntive ionic radius (Shannon 1976). These are, for ex-\nample, zircon (ZrSiO4) or monazite (Ce,La,Nd,Th)PO4,\nwhich generally contain sufficient U to be analysed,\nranging from 1 to > 10000 ppm for zircon and 282 to\n> 50000 ppm for monazite (Heaman and Parish 1991).\nThe common Pb content of the two minerals is gener-\nally (but not always) very low.\n\nSecondly, the system must have been closed to the\ngain or loss of the parent and daughter isotopes. In most\ncases, we deal with a loss of radiogenic lead which can\nbe easily mobilized by geological processes because, as\nin the case of zircon, radiogenic Pb2+ does not fit the\nZr4+ ion characteristics (Mezger and Krogstad 1997).\nThe result is that the isotopic analyses plot on a \u201cDis-\ncordia line\u201d which intersects the Concordia curve twice\n(Fig. 1): the upper intercept generally represents the\ntime of crystallization of the mineral; the lower inter-\ncept may, in cases, be interpreted as the geological event\nwhen the crystal lost part of his radiogenic lead. Min-\neral standards for isotopic analyses by LA-ICP-MS or\nion microprobe should meet these two requirements, i.e.\nthey should be concordant, and void of common lead.\n\nMETHOLOGICAL PROGRESS OF Pb-U ISOTOPIC\nANALYSIS\n\nConventional Pb-U analyses for absolute age determi-\nnation of geological materials commonly use the tech-\nnique of ID-TIMS (Isotope Dilution Thermal Ioniza-\ntion Mass Spectrometry). Sample preparation is labori-\nous (e.g. Nebel-Jacobsen et al. 2005, Amelin and Davis\n2006). The minerals have to be separated from the rock\nmatrix, cleaned and sometimes abraded if the outer\nmargins show alteration features (Mattinson 2005). The\nminerals are dissolved, and the Pb and U isotopes sep-\narated by resin columns in an ultra-clean laboratory to\nallow sub-nanogram Pb isotopic analysis. The solutions\nare deposited on rhenium filaments for thermal ioniza-\ntion and introduction of the ionized species into a mag-\nnetic sector mass spectrometer.\n\nThis techniques has been successfully applied for\ndecades and is still commonly used for U-Pb age deter-\nminations and other isotopic geochemical applications\nworldwide. Low-blank laboratories normally achieve a\nvery high precision of the age determinations (Parrish\nand Noble 2003, Krymsky et al. 2007). However, short-\ncomings of the technique are the need to separate the\nminerals from the matrix, the lack of spatial resolution\nof the analyses, and the laborious wet chemical prepara-\ntion under ultra-clean laboratory conditions. On the other\nhand, the quality of the analyses is excellent, reaching\nprecisions down to ? 0.1% for the Pb/U isotopic ratios\n(e.g., Mattinson 2005).\n\nAnother method which overcomes the need for wet\nchemical preparation is the Sensitive High Resolution\nIon Micro Probe (SHRIMP). It focuses a high-energy\nion beam (usually O?2 ) onto an area of usually &lt;30?m\nfor in situ isotopic analysis of minerals such as zircon.\nThe method reaches a precision and accuracy of about\n1.0% (e.g., Cocherie et al. 2005). The SIMS method\n(Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry), on the other hand,\nemploys a primary ion beam and analyses the ejected\nsecondary ions. It focuses an O? ion beam of typically\n> 10?m in diameter on a solid sample surface, and is\nprimarily applied to quantify major and trace element\ncontents (for example, Pettke et al. 2004).\n\nMany recent analytical methods, instead, use an\n\u201cInductively coupled plasma\u201d ionization method (ICP)\nof the sample, generating a fine aerosol which is ionized\nin an Ar plasma (Horn et al. 2000). With Ar having a\nhigh first ionization potential of 15.759 V, the plasma\nionizes all other elements to single-charged ions except\nfor He, F and Ne. The method was developed in the\nearly 1980s for introduction of dissolved samples.\nLikewise, the ICP array may be connected to a laser\nsystem which ablates a solid sample whose vaporized\nmaterial is then transported by a He gas flow into the\nICP unit. This method overcomes the need of ultra-clean\nlaboratory conditions and allows the selective sampling\nof solid material on the micrometer scale. On the de-\ntector side, the recent technology came up with multi-\ncollector (MC) arrangements which allow the simulta-\nneous detection of the relative abundance of various\nisotopes (see Simonetti et al. 2005). The conventional\nFaraday cup detectors (normally 9 in a line) may be\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2009) 81 (1)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/2/5 \u2014 13:57 \u2014 page 102 \u2014 #4\n\n102 BERNHARD B\u00dcHN, M\u00c1RCIO M. PIMENTEL, MASSIMO MATTEINI and ELTON L. DANTAS\n\nequipped with additional multichannel ion counters\n(MICs) for high-sensitivity isotope analyses. The equip-\nment with additional MICs is only a spatial problem\nwithin the Faraday cup arrangement and, generally,\n6\u20138 MICs may easily be accommodated, allowing the\nsimultaneous analysis of about 15 isotopes.\n\nThe shortcomings of the laser ablation multi-col-\nlector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry\n(LA-MC-ICP-MS) relative to SHRIMP or conventional\nTIMS analyses have been its lower precision. The laser\nablation process is not as stable as the SHRIMP method,\nor as the introduction of the sample in solution as in\nthe case of TIMS. Firstly, this is due to the fragmenta-\ntion and vaporization process of the solid material ab-\nlated. The laser beam may ablate parts of the mineral\nwhich are slightly fractured, altered or otherwise phys-\nically weakened or inhomogenized by previous geolog-\nical processes, including the destruction of the mineral\nlattice by the proper radioactive radiation. The result is\nthat the ablation and vaporization process of the mate-\nrial may vary in efficiency and completeness and, thus,\nthe material transport to the plasma may not be contin-\nuous. Secondly, the carrier gas flux, normally ultrapure\nHe, has an appreciable effect on the stability of the gas\nflow. Hence, the laser settings, such as laser intensity,\nlaser frequency and beam diameter, together with the\ngas flow parameters, are fundamental for a reasonably\nstable signal reaching the detectors.\n\nWith the more recent developments, however, the\nanalytical uncertainties are getting closer to those of\nSHRIMP (see Willigers et al. 2002). Bruguier et al.\n(2001) arrived at 6%, Horn et al. (2000) at 2%, Chang\net al. (2006) at 4%, and Gerdes and Zeh (2006) at\n3\u20134% precision or accuracy for U-Pb isotope ratios of\nnatural materials. These values depend very much on\nthe nature of the material analysed, such as its com-\nposition, presence of fractures, inclusions and hetero-\ngeneities. The LA-ICP-MS analyses may be even more\nprecise for synthetic glass standards which are chemi-\ncally and isotopically homogeneous (Bernal et al. 2005).\nOften, the largest uncertainty is given by the analysis\nof the standards (Chang et al. 2006) which are gener-\nally natural minerals including all the potential pitfalls.\nWith a precision of that magnitude, however, with the\ncontrol of the spatial resolution of the material anal-\n\nysed, and with the relatively easy preparation of the\nsamples, the laser ablation MC-ICP mass spectrometry\ncertainly is the method of choice for the coming years\nfor isotopic analysis of solid materials in the geo- and\nenvironmental sciences (Willigers et al. 2002, Ko\u0161ler\nand Sylvester 2003).\n\nSET-UP OF THE LASER ABLATION\nMC-ICP-MS U-Pb METHOD\n\nThe analytical equipment used in this study was installed\nat the \u201cLaborat\u00f3rio de estudos geocronol\u00f3gicos, geo-\ndin\u00e2micos e ambientais\u201d of the Geosciences Institute\nof the University of Bras\u00edlia, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil, by ini-\ntiative of Petr\u00f3leo Brasileiro S/A \u2013 PETROBRAS and\nthe \u201cMinist\u00e9rio de Minas e Energia\u201d. The laboratory is\npart of the \u201cRede de Estudos Geodin\u00e2micos e Ambien-\ntais \u2013 GEOCHRONOS\u201d. It was inaugurated in Decem-\nber 2006 and consists, apart from other installations and\ninstrumentation, of a Thermo Finnigan Neptune multi-\ncollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer.\nAttached to this is a New Wave 213?m Nd-YAG solid\nstate laser which provides the ablated material to the\nmass spectrometer.\n\nSAMPLE PREPARATION\n\nSample preparation is straightforward. The minerals of\ninterest, in this case zircon, are separated from the rock\nmatrix by crushing the rock, concentrating the heavy\nmineral fraction by panning, separating the zircon grains\nby a Frantz magnetic separator, and final hand-picking\nof individual zircon grains. In situ analysis directly on\na rock slab or thin section is also possible. However,\nit was found that the procedure of pre-concentration\nlargely facilitates the measurements and localization of\nthe zircons, so that it is worthwhile to be done.\n\nThe zircon grains are then located under the binoc-\nular one by one on a glass wafer covered with a double-\nsided tape in order to secure the grains. A 9 mm diameter\nplastic ring is placed on the tape around the zircons, and\nfilled with two-compound epoxy. After 1-2 days of dry-\ning, the mounts are removed from the tape. Polishing of\nthe mounts is done with 3?m followed by 1 ?m diamond\npaste in order to expose unaltered and clean zircon sur-\nfaces. It is advisable to locate the grains on existing flat\ncrystal surfaces (if present) to avoid excessive polishing.\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2009) 81 (1)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/2/5 \u2014 13:57 \u2014 page 103 \u2014 #5\n\nPb AND U ISOTOPE ANALYSIS BY LA-MC-ICP-MS 103\n\nThe mounts are then taken to an ultrasonic bath with 3%\nHNO3, and then cleaned with distilled water. A Nylon\nsample holder which takes three mounts was especially\nconstructed. The three sites may be occupied with one\nstandard and two samples, or with two standards and one\nsample.\n\nTHE LASER SET-UP\n\nThe sample chamber is flushed with He gas of analyt-\nical quality, which samples the ablated and vaporized\nmaterial to be transported via Tygon tubes into the ICP.\nBefore entering the laser sample chamber, the He passes\nthrough a glass tube filled with gold-coated quartz crys-\ntals (gold trap) to remove the largest part of mercury\n(Hg) whose isotope 204Hg interferes with the 204Pb iso-\ntope analysed to apply the common Pb correction. The\nHe gas flux is commonly 0.35\u20130.45 L/min.\n\nThe laser is run at a frequency of 7\u201310 Hz and\nan energy of 30\u201336%, resulting in a laser energy of ca.\n0.5 to 1.2 J/cm2. A small laser spot size of say 30?m\napplied to a single spot with these laser conditions would\nnot produce enough material for a reasonable signal, but\nat least 40\u201350?m would be required, with the signal\nintensity deteriorating along duration of the analysis be-\ncause of the deepening of the laser pit. This suggested\nthe use of a raster scheme of the laser which samples\nonly the surface of the zircon. The raster is composed of\ntwo parallel and a connecting line with a 20?m spacing.\nWith a 30?m beam diameter applied here, the sampled\narea of the zircon is a square of about 70?m on each\nside. With a speed of 1?m/sec, the propagating laser\nspot takes about 1 min to pass the raster, which is enough\ntime to collect the signal. This setting also avoids the\nprominent down-hole fractionation of isotopes which\nwould require an additional correction, and a signifi-\ncantly higher laser energy to drill the zircon. Before\nsignal collection, a pre-ablation run along the raster is\napplied to clean the mineral surface. The running con-\nditions of this cleaning run are: 40?m spot size, fre-\nquency 10 Hz and 25% laser energy.\n\nTHE ICP-MS AND MULTI-COLLECTOR SET-UP\n\nBefore entering the plasma, the He gas coming from the\nlaser with the ablated material, is combined with Ar gas\nof analytical quality which sustains the plasma. The de-\n\ntector arrangement consists of a central Faraday cup and\n4 Faraday cups each on the high side and low side of the\ncentre cup (Fig. 2). For high-sensitivity analyses of the\nPb and U isotopes, the mass spectrometer is equipped\nwith 6 ion counters (ICs, or multichannel ion counters\nMICs). Four of them are fixed on the outermost Faraday\ncup of the low side (cup L4), one on the third cup of the\nlow side (cup L3), and one on the outermost Faraday cup\non the high side (cup H4). The latter is used only for\nthe analysis of 238U in materials with extremely low U\ncontent. For the present application, we analysed 238U\non the Faraday cup H4. The other isotopes are collected\non the low side. The four ICs on the cup L4 are fixed\nat defined distances referring to: one mass unit between\nL4 and IC5, one mass unit between IC5 and IC4, two\nmass units between IC4 and IC3, and two mass units\nbetween IC3 and IC2. The signals collected on the four\nICs are: 207Pb on IC5, 206Pb on IC4, 204Hg/204Pb on\nIC3, and 202Hg on IC2. Because of the always present\ncontamination of the He gas with Hg, a correction for\nthe isobaric interference between 204Hg and 204Pb has\nto be applied, using the signal of 202Hg collected on IC2.\n\nDATA COLLECTION\n\nWith this collector set-up, five isotopes are analysed si-\nmultaneously. Before analysis, the Faraday cups are\ncalibrated for baseline and gain, and the ICs for their\nyield. To ensure the optimal operating voltage and the\nsame sensitivity for the ICs, a signal of about 300,000\ncounts per second (cps) is successively directed into the\n4 ICs using different analysing lines. We use a solution\nof 206Pb for this cross-calibration. Based on the signal\nresponse for each IC, the operating voltage of each IC\nis adjusted in order to ensure measuring conditions with\nthe same sensitivity for all ICs used.\n\nFor standard and sample analysis, the signals are\ncollected in a single block with 40 cycles of 1.049 sec.\neach. The laser is started and, when the signal at\nthe detectors has reached its maximum, the 40 cycles\nare taken. A typical analysis therefore takes about 1\nmin and is illustrated in Figure 3. The isotopes 202Hg,\n204(Pb+Hg), 206Pb and 207Pb are read in counts per sec-\nond (cps), and 235U in mV, which is transferred into\ncps by multiplication by a factor of 62,500.

The method accounts for the drift of the\ninstrument, and eliminates the need to correct for the\nmass bias of individual isotopes.\n\nDATA REDUCTION\n\nThe isotope data of the 40 analysed cycles are trans-\nferred into an in-house Excel spreadsheet for data re-\nduction. The isotope ratios of the 40 cycles are evalu-\nated on a 2? standard error rejection basis. The routine\nthen calculates the error correlation value ? (rho) for the\n206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U data. The isobaric contri-\nbution of 204Hg is subtracted from the joint 204Pb/204Hg\npeak by considering the analyzed 202Hg/204Hg ratio. The\nspreadsheet allows to chose between three ways to deter-\nmine the 202Hg/204Hg value which is applied for correc-\ntion: (i) from the mean of the two bracketing blanks, (ii)\nfrom the mean of the two bracketing (common Pb-free)\nstandards, or (iii) from the mean of the four. Normally,\nthe difference between the three determinations is mi-\nnor. We consider this more favourable than applying the\nnatural 202Hg/204Hg ratio of 4.346, which would require\nan absolutely precise cross-calibration of IC2 and IC3.\nBecause 235U cannot be analysed with this type of cup\nconfiguration, the natural ratio 238U/235U of 137.88 is\nused to calculate the 235U intensity.\n\nThe correction for instrumental drift and mass bias\nis done by considering the two standards analysed be-\nfore and after the samples, and the two blank analy-\nses run before and after the samples, respectively, af-\nter applying a blank correction for all isotopes analysed.\nThe normalization of the isotopic ratios of the samples\n(Rspl) follows the formula of Albar\u00e8de et al. (2004):\n\nRspl =\nRstd \u00d7 rspl\n\n(\nr1??std1 \u00d7 r\n\n?\nstd2\n\n) (3)\n\nfor which Rstd is the true isotopic ratio of the standard\n(207Pb/206Pb or 206Pb/238U ratios, respectively), rspl is\nthe analysed isotopic ratio of the sample, and rstd1 and\nrstd2 are the analysed isotopic ratios of the two standards\nbefore and after the samples along the sequence. The\nvariable ? (theta) is a time factor (Albar\u00e8de et al. 2004)\nor, in other words, gives respective weight to the two\nstandard measurements. It depends on the location of\nthe samples within the analysing sequence, and takes\nvalues between 0 and 1. For example, three successive\nanalyses run between two standards and two blanks sug-\ngest ? = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75 for samples 1, 2 and 3,\nrespectively. The term\n\n(\nr1??std1 \u00d7 r\n\n?\nstd2\n\n)\nis a linear inter-\n\npolation of the logarithms of the isotopic ratios, which\naccounts for the generally exponential instrumental drift.\nThe same algorithm is applied to correct for the drift in\nthe blank analyses. An alternative would be to inject\na diluted thallium (Tl) solution to determine the mass\nbias of the Pb isotopes (e.g., Horn et al. 2000) which,\nhowever, does not allow the correction of U mass bias.\nThe standard-sample bracketing approach applied here,\ntherefore, certainly bears the least error for that analyt-\nical method, as it does not require intensive mass bias\ncorrections.\n\nThe corrected 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/206Pb ratios so\nobtained are transferred into absolute age information\nusing the software of Ludwig (2003). The software was\nalso used to plot the Concordia diagrams. The errors of\nthe 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/206Pb ratios were propagated\nby quadratic addition of the external reproducibility and\nthe within-run precision, following equation (4):\n\n2?\n\n(\n206Pb\n238U\n\n, or\n207Pb\n206Pb\n\n)\n\npropagated\n\n=\n(\n\n2SD?2analysed + 2SE\n?2\nanalysed\n\n)1/2\n(4)\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2009) 81 (1)\n\n\n\n\u201cmain\u201d \u2014 2009/2/5 \u2014 13:57 \u2014 page 105 \u2014 #7\n\nPb AND U ISOTOPE ANALYSIS BY LA-MC-ICP-MS 105\n\n1.0E-02\n\n1.0E+02\n\n1.0E+06\n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100\n\nCicles of 1 second each\n\nC\no\n\nu\nn\n\nts\n p\n\ne\nr \n\ns\ne\n\nc\no\n\nn\nd\n\n o\nr \n\nra\nti\n\no\n\n207Pb/206Pb\n\n206Pb/238U\n\n207Pb\n\n204Hg/Pb\n\n202Hg\n238U\n\nLaser\nON\n\nLaser\nOFF\n\nBack-\nground\n\n40 cycles considered for\nquantification\n\nBack to\nbackground\n\n206Pb\n\nFig. 3 \u2013 Typical signal sequence of a laser ablation experiment.

The within-run precision (2 SE?2analysed)\nis the standard error calculated for each analysis. The\nresulting errors are 2? standard deviations.\n\nZircon U-Pb isotopic analyses may require a correc-\ntion for the common lead contribution to the total 206Pb\nand 207Pb signals. There are a couple of methods to do\nthis in the literature (see Andersen 2002, Horstwood et\n\nal. 2003). For minerals with a low common Pb content\nas, for example, zircon, we use a correction based on the\namount of non-radiogenic 204Pb. The counts per second\nof 204Pb (including a correction for 204Hg) are used to\ndeduce the amount of non-radiogenic, common 206Pb\nand 207Pb, given a common Pb composition following\nthe model of Stacey and Kramers (1975).

PIMENTEL, MASSIMO MATTEINI and ELTON L. DANTAS\n\nof Andersen (2002) to arrive at common Pb-corrected\n206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U isotopic ratios. The neces-\nsity for a correction is judged from the 204Pb signal in-\ntensity. Values smaller than ? 25 cps (blank-corrected),\nresulting in 206Pb/204Pb ratios well beyond 3000, sug-\ngest an insignificant common Pb content which would\nnot recognizably effect the calculated ages. All zircons\nanalysed in this study met this condition, and therefore\ndid not require a correction.\n\nSTANDARDS AND SAMPLES\n\nThree international zircon standards were analysed, us-\ning each one as an external standard and correcting the\nremaining two against it. This yields a set of 6 iso-\ntope ratio and age data which are compared with the\ncertified values of the standards (see Table I). The stan-\ndards are: (i) GJ-1 zircon standard provided by the ARC\nNational Key Centre for Geochemical Evolution and\nMetallogeny of Continents (GEMOC), Australia. This is\na gem-quality zircon crystal of about 0.7 cm in diameter\nwhich was broken and prepared for analysis. Its refer-\nence age after Jackson et al. (2004) is: 207Pb/206Pb age\n= 608.6 \u00b1 1.1 Ma, 206Pb/238U age = 600.4 \u00b1 1.8 Ma,\n207Pb/235U age = 602.1 \u00b1 3.0 Ma; (ii) Temora 2, pro-\nvided by Lance Black, Geoscience Australia, Australia,\nwhich comes from the Middledale gabbroic diorite in\neastern Australia; the zircon crystals have a size of about\n300\u2013500 ?m and, prior to sample preparation, the con-\ncentrate was hand-picked to obtain a high-purity zircon\nconcentrate. Its reference age after Black et al. (2004)\nis: 207Pb/206Pb age = 419.1 \u00b1 9.1 Ma, 206Pb/238U age\n= 416.2 \u00b1 1.1 Ma, 207Pb/235U age = 416.7 \u00b1 1.7 Ma;\n(iii) FC1 zircon concentrate provided by Richard Arm-\nstrong, Australian National University, Canberra, Aus-\ntralia; the crystals have sizes of approximately 50\u2013\n100?m, and were hand-picked prior to sample prepara-\ntion; they were extracted from the Duluth Complex in\nthe U.S.A. Its reference age (Paces and Miller 1993)\nis: 207Pb/206Pb age = 1098.9 Ma, 206Pb/238U age =\n1099.9 Ma, 207Pb/235U age = 1100.0 Ma.\n\nFor an additional test of the method, two zircon\nsamples from our own laboratory which had previously\nbeen dated by other analytical methods were also investi-\ngated here. One is a relatively young zircon concentrate\n(sample HD66) from a hornblende-bearing orthogneiss\n\nof the Neoproterozoic Goi\u00e1s magmatic arc which has\npreviously been dated at 630 \u00b1 5 Ma (2? ) by U-Pb ID-\nTIMS in our laboratory (Laux et al. 2005). Its average\n207Pb/206Pb TIMS age is 633.3\u00b15.7 Ma. The other sam-\nple (EC69A) has much older zircon crystals and went\nthrough a more complex geological history. They were\nextracted from a migmatized hornblende- and biotite-\nbearing tonalite from an Archean nucleus of the S\u00e3o\nJos\u00e9 do Campestre Massif in the Borborema Province,\nNE Brazil. The zircons yielded an upper intercept age\nof 3065 \u00b1 12 Ma determined by SHRIMP analysis\n(Dantas et al. unpublished data).\n\nRESULTS\n\nBetween 13 and 23 analyses were run for the standards\nGJ1, Temora 2 and FC1. Figure 4 shows the ages ob-\ntained for each standard normalized against one another\nin a Concordia diagram, and Table I summarizes the data\nobtained. The concordance between the values obtained\nand the referenced standard data of the 207Pb/206Pb,\n206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U age data is well satisfactory.\nWe obtained precisions of 1.9 to 3.7% (2? standard de-\nviation) for the 207Pb/206Pb, 206Pb/238U and 207Pb/235U\nage data, depending on the isotope system and on the\nparticular standard. The accuracy was calculated as the\npercentage of deviation between the analysed Concor-\ndia age and the referenced 207Pb/206Pb age. The Concor-\ndia age, following Ludwig (2003) is, \u201cthe most-probable\nage for a data-point (or weighted-mean data-point) on a\nConcordia diagram, where the true location of the data\npoint is assumed to fall precisely on the Concordia\ncurve\u201d. Because not all referenced standards provide\nthe error correlation coefficient to calculate that age,\ntheir referenced 207Pb/206Pb age was used. The accu-\nracy so obtained varies between 0.6 and 3.8% (2? stan-\ndard deviation).\n\nThe majority of the 23 analyses obtained for the\nnatural sample HD66 (Table II) were taken as multi-\nple analyses on different localities of individual grains.\nThey are all concordant (Fig. 5), yielding a Concordia\nage of 627.6 \u00b1 1.3 Ma, which is identical within er-\nror to the TIMS age of 630 \u00b1 5 Ma. None of the zir-\ncons required a common Pb correction. The 204Hg-cor-\nrected 204Pb signal was 30 cps at most, yielding calcu-\nlated 206Pb/204Pb ratios between 3000 and 50000.

Most of the LA-ICP-\nMS analyses were taken as multiple shots on individ-\nual zircon grains. None of the zircons required a com-\nmon Pb correction. The ICP-MS analyses display var-\nious groups of zircons plotting on supposedly different\nDiscordia lines (Fig. 6). The youngest upper intercept\nage, defined by four discordant and three concordant\nanalytical points, yields the age of 3045 \u00b1 24 Ma,\nwhich agrees within error with the SHRIMP age of\n3065 \u00b1 12 Ma. However, various older zircon popu-\nlations were encountered in the sample. One is defined\nby 17 discordant zircon analyses which yield an upper\nintercept age of 3305 \u00b1 51 Ma. A minor population\ncomposed of three discordant analyses gives an upper\nintercept age of 3625 \u00b1 38 Ma. The two latter pop-\n\nulations may relate to 3.4\u20133.5 Ga ages reported from\nthe same area by Dantas et al. (2004). Another group\nof five highly discordant zircon analyses with extremely\nlow 206Pb/238U ratios may represent still another, even\nolder geological event. Three analyses on grain 14 (see\nTable IV, but not included in Fig. 6) yielded one con-\ncordant and two nearly concordant data with ages be-\ntween 540 and 570 Ma. They represent another event\nof resetting of the isotope system during the Neopro-\nterozoic/Cambrian Brasiliano cycle. Therefore, the Dis-\ncordias of all older zircon populations were anchored to\n558 Ma, which is the mean of these three analyses.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nA comparison of the LA-ICP-MS results of the natural\nsample HD66 with TIMS analyses shows a fine confor-\nmity even within the limits of error, yielding 627.6 \u00b1\n1.3 Ma for LA-ICP-MS and 630 \u00b1 5 Ma for the TIMS\nanalyses.

The majority of shots were taken as single shots on zircon grains.\n\nthat there was no Pb loss in the zircons (no discordant\nzircons), in contrast to three out of four TIMS analy-\nses (Fig. 5a). It is most probable, that weathered or\notherwise isotopically disturbed surfaces of the zircons\nare responsible for the discordant U-Pb TIMS data,\nsince the zircons were not abraded before digestion to\nremove possible alterations or disturbances. The LA-\nICP-MS method avoids this by polishing of the zircon\ngrains before analysis, and by a laser pre-ablation which\ncleans the uppermost part of the mineral surface.\n\nThe LA-ICP-MS analyses of the natural sample\nEC69A show a complex history of zircon growth and\nlead loss. Three concordant zircon analyses, together\nwith 4 other analyses, define an upper intercept age of\n3045 \u00b1 24 Ma (Fig. 6) which agrees, within error, with\nthe 3065 \u00b1 12 Ma SHRIMP age. There are other discor-\n\ndant zircon analyses which, although being discordant,\nindicate a complex history of crystallization and partial\nresetting. In that particular case, the internal structure\nof the zircons would have to be imaged by cathodolu-\nminescence or back-scattered electron techniques prior\nto analysis, for ensuring an unequivocal interpretation\nof the various age populations. The analyses presented\nhere show, nevertheless, that it is possible to detect an\neven complex geological history from a set of only 10\u2013\n15 zircon grains, by high spatial resolution LA-ICP-MS\nanalysis.\n\nThe LA-MC-ICP-MS method presented here is\ndesigned for rapid analysis of large sample sets, which\noften are needed in sediment provenance or other re-\ngional geological studies.

Um novo m\u00e9todo tem sido desenvolvido nos \u00faltimos\n\nanos, a abla\u00e7\u00e3o a laser multi-coletor espectrometria de massas\n\ncom plasma indutivamente acoplado (LA-MC-ICP-MS), su-\n\nperando o laborioso trabalho anteriormente necess\u00e1rio em ou-\n\ntros m\u00e9todos, na prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de amostras, e permite obten\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nde raz\u00f5es isot\u00f3picas com alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o espacial de micr\u00f4me-\n\ntros. O presente estudo descreve os procedimentos anal\u00edticos e\n\nos m\u00e9todos usados na redu\u00e7\u00e3o de dados que est\u00e3o sendo apli-\n\ncados no Laborat\u00f3rio de Geocronologia da Universidade de\n\nBras\u00edlia.
