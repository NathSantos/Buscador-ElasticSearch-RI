The first method\n\nreflects coastal erosion as continuity of the geological evolution in the last 5 ka, taking place mainly along\n\nthe southern half of gentle coastal projections. The second method represents a shorter temporal scale and\n\nindicates that approximately 80% of the coast is eroding. Beach profiling has been measured in very few\n\nplaces that are distant from each other since the early 1990s; consequently, their results reflect local and\n\nvery short time shoreline behavior. A critical evaluation of published data addressing coastal erosion in Rio\n\nGrande do Sul strongly suggests that short and long term negative balance on the sediment budget is the main\n\ncause of erosion along this coastline.\n\nKey words: coastal evolution, Quaternary, shoreline changes, coastal barriers, sediment budget.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nCoastal erosion is a process occurring worldwide,\n\nespecially on low-lying coastal plains (Bird 1985).\n\nMany studies have discussed the causes of erosion,\n\nin the short and long temporal and spatial scales.\n\nErosion usually results from the combination of\n\nmultiple factors interacting along the coast. How-\n\never, regardless of the time and spatial scale, coastal\n\nerosion is essentially a consequence of sea level rise\n\nand/or negative sediment budget.\n\nRio Grande do Sul (RS) is the southernmost\n\nstate of Brazil (Fig. 1).

Probably, this is the reason why coastal\n\nstudies have not attracted the attention of commu-\n\nnity, government, or researchers until recently. Only\n\nin the late 1980s, studies started to focus on coastal\n\nprocesses, including the first published note ad-\n\ndressing beach erosion in RS (Tomazelli and Vill-\n\nwock 1989). Since then, coastal erosion in RS has\n\nbeen discussed on several studies, mainly regarding\n\nits natural and human-induced causes in the long-\n\n(e.g. Tomazelli et al. 1998, Tomazelli and Dillen-\n\nburg 1998, Dillenburg et al. 2000) and short-term\n\n(e.g. Calliari et al. 1998a,b, Esteves et al. 2000,\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)\n\n\n\n612 S\u00c9RGIO R. DILLENBURG, LUCIANA S. ESTEVES and LUIZ J. TOMAZELLI\n\nToldo et al. 1999). Recently, attempts have been\n\nmade to critically evaluate published data on ero-\n\nsion along the RS coast (Esteves et al. 2002).\n\nThe increasing interest on coastal processes\n\nand shoreline changes reflects the intensification of\n\ncoastal occupation and beach use, as well as the\n\ngrowing economic importance of beach-related\n\ntourism. This paper aims to critically evaluate the\n\nstate-of-the-art in the knowledge of coastal erosion\n\nin RS almost 15 years after the first studies about\n\nthis theme.\n\nREGIONAL SETTING\n\nThe southern Brazil continental margin is a rifted\n\nplate boundary formed in Early Cretaceous times.\n\nIn the vicinity of Rio Grande do Sul (29? to 34? south\nlatitudes), deposition of a large amount of post-rift,\n\nmainly clastic sediments, produced a wide (100 to\n\n200 km), shallow (100 to 140 m), and gently sloping\n\n(0.03? to 0.08?) continental shelf. Seismic records\nof the upper slope reveal a sedimentary thickness of\n\nat least 10 km (Fontana 1990).\n\nRio Grande do Sul coastline is characterized\n\nby a 620-km long and gently undulating barrier,\n\ngenerally oriented NE-SW, comprised essentially\n\nby exposed, fine sand, dissipative to intermediate\n\nbeaches (Fig. 1). It is one of the longest sandy\n\nbeaches of the world, presenting only two perma-\n\nnent discontinuities (Tramanda\u00ed and Patos lagoon\n\ninlets).\n\nClimate is humid temperate with annual mean\n\ntemperatures of 18?C, presenting warm to hot tem-\nperatures in summer (mean of 26?C) and cool tem-\nperatures in winter (mean of 12?C). Rainfall is\nevenly distributed throughout the year, ranging\n\nfrom 1000 to 1500 mm. The dominant northeast\n\nwinds persistently blow along the RS coast, al-\n\nthough southerly winds are the strongest and more\n\nfrequent during the fall and winter seasons.\n\nThis is a microtidal coast with semidiurnal\n\ntides presenting a mean range of 0.5 m. Thus, sedi-\n\nment transport and deposition along the open coast\n\nis primarily dominated by wave action. Although\n\nthe most frequent waves are generated by local and\n\nusually long-lasting winds from the northeast,\n\nsoutherly waves associated to the formation of\n\nextra-tropical cyclones far away in the Mid-Atlantic\n\nare the strongest. The average significant wave\n\nheight is 1.5 m, measured at depths of about 15-20 m\n\n(Motta 1969). A net northward littoral drift is ev-\n\nident in coastal geomorphologic features (Tomazelli\n\nand Villwock 1992) and by field measurements\n\n(Toldo et al. 1993). At present, RS beaches receive\n\nvery little sand from inland as most of the beadload\n\ncarried through the drainage system is trapped in\n\nlagoons and other coastal plain environments\n\n(Tomazelli et al. 1998).\n\nThe post-glacial sea level history of the RS\n\ncoast extends from about 17.5 ka BP, when the sea\n\nwas positioned at about -120 to -130 m (Corr\u00eaa\n\n1995). Since then, sea level rose at an average rate\n\nof 1.2 cm/yr until 6.5 ka BP, when it started to slow\n\ndown (Fig. 2). There is no reliable data on sea level\n\nchange from the Middle to Late Holocene along the\n\nRS coast. Sea level curves established for areas fur-\n\nther north in Brazil indicate that sea level reached\n\na few meters above its present level at the culmi-\n\nnation of the Post-glacial Marine Transgression \u2013\n\nPMT (5 ka BP), followed thereafter by a slow sea\n\nlevel fall (Martin et al. 1979, Angulo and Lessa\n\n1997) (Fig. 2). It is likely that the general shape\n\nof these sea level curves also apply to the northern\n\nsector of the Rio Grande do Sul coast (Dillenburg\n\n1996), although peaks might have not reached the\n\nsame level. The sea level curve presented by Martin\n\net al. (1979) show a maximum of +5 m for the coast\n\nof Bahia (NE Brazil). Angulo and Lessa (1997)\n\nsuggest a maximum sea level around +3.5 m in the\n\nstates of S\u00e3o Paulo (SE Brazil) and Paran\u00e1 (southern\n\nBrazil, north of RS). Finally, Angulo et al. (1999)\n\nshow evidences of a maximum around +2 m in the\n\nstate of Santa Catarina, 100 km north of RS.\n\nQUATERNARY COASTAL EVOLUTION\n\nThe geologic evolution of the RS coastal plain was\n\ndescribed by Villwock et al. (1986) and detailed in\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)\n\n\n\nCOASTAL EROSION IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL 613\n\nFig. 1 \u2013 Location of the Rio Grande do Sul coastal plain showing its general geology\n\n(Modified from Tomazelli et al. 2000).\n\nseveral following studies (i.e. Villwock and Toma-\n\nzelli 1995, Tomazelli et al. 2000). This section sum-\n\nmarizes the main points of the Quaternary coastal\n\nevolution, as it is a key-factor for the present shore-\n\nline configuration.\n\nThe coastal plain comprises two major depo-\n\nsitional systems formed by sea level fluctuations in\n\nthe Quaternary: the alluvial fan deposits that mark\n\nthe western limit of the coastal plain and the barrier-\n\nlagoon systems developed seawards (Tomazelli et\n\nal. 2000) (Fig. 1). The alluvial fan system consists\n\nin coarse-grained clastic deposits originated from\n\ngravity flows and accumulated at the base of the\n\nhighlands. These deposits date probably from the\n\nLate Pliocene regression up to the Early Holocene.\n\nDeposits at the edge of coalescent fans were eroded\n\nby higher sea levels in the Pleistocene resulting in\n\nmarine and lagoon terraces that are particularly well\n\ndeveloped and preserved to the south.\n\nFour barrier-lagoon depositional systems were\n\nidentified in the RS coastal plain, each represent-\n\ning the sedimentary record of a marine transgres-\n\nsion, three during the Pleistocene and one in the\n\nHolocene (Fig. 1). Each barrier represents the land-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)\n\n\n\n614 S\u00c9RGIO R. DILLENBURG, LUCIANA S. ESTEVES and LUIZ J.

(1986) named the four\n\nbarrier-lagoon systems as Barrier I (the oldest) to\n\nIV (the youngest). Absolute ages of the Pleistocene\n\nbarriers are still unknown (Tomazelli et al. 2000).\n\nAn attempt to correlate the last major peaks of the\n\noxygen isotopic record and barrier formation sug-\n\ngests that they were probably formed in the last\n\n400 ka (Villwock and Tomazelli 1995). Barrier I,\n\nII, and III correlate with oxygen isotopic stage 11\n\n(about 400 ka), stage 9 (325 ka), and sub-stage 5e\n\n(approximately 120 ka), respectively. Barrier IV\n\nwas formed in the Holocene and corresponds to\n\noxygen isotopic stage 1. About 18 ka ago, sea level\n\nwas near the present shelf break and rose steadily\n\nup to 2-4 m above the present level at the maximum\n\nof the last transgression (5 ka). Recent 14C data in-\n\ndicate that Barrier IV was formed between 6.44 and\n\n4.65 ka in the northern coast of Rio Grande do Sul\n\n(Dillenburg et al. 2004b). After that, a slow sea\n\nlevel fall (rates ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 mm/year)\n\nfavored progradation of Barrier IV in the smooth\n\nembayments in between Torres and Tramanda\u00ed and\n\nin Rio Grande, and retreat along the coastal projec-\n\ntions (Dillenburg et al. 2000).\n\nEVIDENCES OF COASTAL EROSION\n\nAnalysis of the long-term morphodynamics and\n\nstratigraphy of coastal barriers provided the most\n\nconspicuous evidence of erosion along the RS coast,\n\nthe exposure of lagoonal muds and peat at the\n\npresent backshore in Hermenegildo and Bujuru\n\n(Fig. 3a and b). The exhumation of relict muds\n\noccurs continuously along 15 km alongshore in Her-\n\nmenegildo and 60 km in the area Bujuru-Concei\u00e7\u00e3o\n\nlighthouse. In both locations muds are exposed\n\nalong the southern half of the gentle coastal projec-\n\ntions. Lagoonal muds were dated (14C) on 4.33 ka\n\nand 3.49 ka at Hermenegildo and Bujuru, respec-\n\ntively (Tomazelli et al. 1998). The formation of\n\nsuch deposits implies that, at that time, there was a\n\ncoastal barrier seaward of those places. Thus, some-\n\ntime later, the barrier started a landward translation\n\nto reach its present position.\n\nForedunes in front of the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse\n\nhave retreated at an average rate of 2.5 m/yr in the\n\nperiod 1975-1995 (Tomazelli et al. 1998).

The analysis of beach profiles from 1996\n\nto 1999 shows an average retreat rate of 3.6 m/yr for\n\nthe same area and 1 m/yr for Lagamarzinho beach,\n\nabout 70 km north of Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse (Bar-\n\nletta and Calliari 2003). Unfortunately, beach pro-\n\nfiles have been monitored locally and for less than\n\nabout a decade, at best. Consequently, their results\n\nreflect local and short-time shoreline behavior only.\n\nSince 1997, the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline\n\nhas been mapped in a yearly basis using the kine-\n\nmatic Differential Global Positioning System\n\n(DGPS) method (Morton et al. 1993, Toldo et al.\n\n1999, Esteves et al. 2003c). A DGPS is installed\n\nin a vehicle moving along the water line in an av-\n\nerage speed of about 50 km/h to register positions\n\nevery 3 s. DGPS errors are less than 1 m for the\n\nmethod used. In an attempt to determine longer-\n\nterm changes, DGPS lines have been compared to\n\na digitized shoreline of 1975 obtained from topo-\n\ngraphic maps printed in a scale of 1:50,000 (Toldo\n\net al. 1999). Although the scale of the base maps is\n\ninadequate to this type of study, it was the best avail-\n\nable source for a statewide analysis in a time period\n\nof more than a couple of years. A large error range\n\nwas used to qualitatively classify shore segments\n\nin three classes: eroded, stable, and accreted. The\n\ncomparative analysis of the 1975 digitized shore-\n\nline and the 2000 DGPS line indicates that approx-\n\nimately 81% of the beaches are eroding, 12% are\n\nstable, and the remaining 7% are accreting (Esteves\n\net al. 2002). Similarly, Toldo et al. (1999) identified\n\nerosion along 84% of the shoreline and accretion\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)\n\n\n\n616 S\u00c9RGIO R. DILLENBURG, LUCIANA S. ESTEVES and LUIZ J. TOMAZELLI\n\nalong about 8% for the 1975-1997 interval. Obvi-\n\nously, results will be more reliable after decades of\n\ncontinued shoreline mapping from which long-term\n\ntrends and erosion rates can be determined.\n\nCAUSES OF EROSION\n\nAlthough evidences of erosion are clear, its causes\n\nare still in debate. About 15 years ago, the first\n\npaper addressing coastal erosion in RS suggested\n\nthat the key factor leading to erosion was a con-\n\ntemporaneous rise in sea level (Tomazelli and Vill-\n\nwock 1989). Analysis of recent studies indicate that\n\nnegative balances on the sediment budget may play\n\na major role on coastal erosion.\n\nFollowing, the discussion will focus on the two\n\nmain causes of coastal erosion: sea level rise and a\n\nnegative balance on sediment budget. Sea level rise\n\nwill be considered as a factor producing coastal ero-\n\nsion in a long-term when rates of sea level exceeds\n\nrates of sediment input. Sediment budget will be\n\ndiscussed on both short and long term scales.\n\nRelative Sea level Rise\n\nA sea level rise is an outstanding cause of erosion\n\nand an important factor on coastal evolution. Ma-\n\nrine transgression occurs when the rate of sea level\n\nrise exceeds the rates of sediment input to the coast.\n\nSuch conditions typically form transgressive barri-\n\ners on wave-dominated coasts (e.g. Roy et al. 1994).\n\nA barrier translation under a rising sea level leads to\n\nthe overlying of lagoonal/estuarine fine sediments\n\nby barrier sands, usually washover deposits.\n\nTomazelli and Villwock (1989) evocated that a\n\ncontemporaneous sea level rise is eroding the coast-\n\nline of Rio Grande do Sul based on evidences such\n\nas: (a) the exhumation of lagoonal muds at Herme-\n\nnegildo and Bujuru beaches, (b) the landward dune\n\ntransgression, and (c) a 1-meter depth terrace bor-\n\ndering the Patos lagoon, interpreted as a drowned\n\nlagoonal margin. The authors suggest that sea level\n\nstarted to rise 1-2 ka ago, when it probably was 1-2 m\n\nlower than the present level.\n\nLagoonal muds exposed at the backshore are\n\na strong evidence of coastline retreat. However,\n\nthe stratigraphy of transgressive barriers migrating\n\nlandwards due to a sea level rise, clearly shows\n\nthat, after barrier translation, lagoonal/estuarine\n\nsediments may outcrop somewhere at the shoreface\n\nor even at the continental shelf, but not at the back-\n\nshore (see Kraft 1971, Morton 1995, Roy et al.\n\n1994) (Fig. 4a). The outcrop of lagoonal sedi-\n\nments at the backshore typically occurs on barriers\n\nthat are translating landwards mainly controlled by\n\na negative balance on sediment budget during a rel-\n\natively stable sea level condition. A shift from a sea\n\nlevel rise to a negative balance on sediment budget\n\nas the main factor controlling barrier transgression\n\nmay lead to such stratigraphic record where la-\n\ngoonal muds outcrop at the backshore or even at the\n\nforeshore on a microtidal barrier (Dillenburg et al.\n\n2004a) (Fig. 4b and c).\n\nThe hypothesis of a rising sea level inducing\n\nlandward dune transgression was first presented by\n\nCooper (1958) while studying dune fields in Oregon\n\n(USA). Since then, opposite ideas have suggested\n\nthat dunes transgression may be facilitated by the\n\nexposure of shelf sands under a sea level fall (e.g.\n\nDominguez et al. 1987). According to Hesp and\n\nThom (1990), transgressive dunes can be activated\n\neither by changes in external boundary conditions\n\n(e.g. sea level change) or by internal morphody-\n\nnamic adjustments, being difficult to define which\n\none is the effective cause.\n\nFinally, the 1-meter deep terrace bordering the\n\nPatos lagoon is a product of lagoonal margin progra-\n\ndation (Barboza, personal communication) rather\n\nthan a margin drowned by a 1-2 m rise in sea level,\n\nas suggested by Tomazelli and Villwock (1989).\n\nNew 14C datings of shells from a 2.7-m long core\n\ncollected near the border and within the most con-\n\nspicuous terrace showed ages of 240 \u00b1 80 years and\n310\u00b160 years for samples collected at 2.0 and 2.3-m\ndeep, respectively (Barboza, personal communica-\n\ntion). These ages do not support the hypothesis of\n\nthe terrace being a lagoonal margin older or even\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)\n\n\n\nCOASTAL EROSION IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL 617\n\nFig. 4 \u2013 Barrier stratigraphy produced by a sea level rise (a typical transgressive\n\nbarrier) showing the potential outcropping of lagoonal sediments at the shoreface\n\nor at the continental shelf (a), and a receded barrier translating landwards due to a\n\nnegative balance on sediment budget, during a relatively stable sea level condition and\n\nshowing the same general stratigraphy of a transgressive barrier, but with lagoonal\n\nsediments exposed close to sea level (b and c) (From Dillenburg et al. 2004a).\n\ncontemporaneous to the rise in sea level occurred\n\nat 1-2 ka ago, as suggested by Tomazelli and Vill-\n\nwock (1989). Additionally, three studies indicate\n\na continuous sea level fall in the last 2 ka with no\n\nevidences of levels below the present along the\n\nsouthern Brazilian coast (Martin et al. 1979, An-\n\ngulo and Lessa 1997, Angulo et al. 1999).\n\nCoastal Sediment Budget\n\nSediment budget is a major factor controlling shore-\n\nline changes. Sea level change is the key-factor\n\ndetermining large-scale coastal evolution when it\n\nrises or falls rapidly. However, when sea level is\n\nstable (or quasi-stable), temporal and spatial varia-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)\n\n\n\n618 S\u00c9RGIO R. DILLENBURG, LUCIANA S. ESTEVES and LUIZ J. TOMAZELLI\n\ntions in the sediment budget control barriers evolu-\n\ntion (Roy et al. 1994). Generally, negative balances\n\non sediment budget favors shoreline retreat, while\n\npositive balances favors progradation.\n\nThe RS coast presents two large lagoons along\n\nthe central (Patos lagoon) and southern coastal sec-\n\ntors (Mirim lagoon) and several other small lagoons\n\nand lakes along the northern littoral. This lagoon\n\nsystem traps sediment from fluvial discharge, re-\n\nducing significantly the sand volume reaching the\n\nshore (Tomazelli et al. 1998). Such condition exists\n\nsince the formation of Barrier IV, so inland sources\n\nhave not contributed to coastal sediment budget at\n\nleast in the last 5 ka. Alongshore gradients of wave\n\nenergy regulate the sand budget in the RS coast\n\n(Dillenburg et al. 2003). Large-scale gentle coastal\n\nprojections concentrate wave energy while it is\n\ndissipated in the gentle shelf gradients adjacent to\n\ncoastal reentrances. The latter has favored high rates\n\nof onshore sand transfer inducing coastal prograda-\n\ntion in a long-term (Dillenburg et al. 2000). Thus, a\n\nlink between coastal morphology, wave energy gra-\n\ndients, and imbalances on sand budget is evident.\n\nChanges in coastal sediment budget in RS will be\n\ndiscussed below in terms of long and short temporal\n\nand spatial scales.\n\nLong Scale\n\nLong-term changes on coastal sediment budget will\n\nbe discussed here as the influence of a macro-scale\n\nshoreline configuration and shelf morphology on\n\nthe alongshore distribution of wave energy that has\n\nstrongly controlled coastal evolution in Rio Grande\n\ndo Sul (Dillenburg et al. 2000).\n\nAt the end of the Post-Glacial Marine Trans-\n\ngression (5 ka) the contour of the RS coast was sim-\n\nilar to the present one, which is gently undulated,\n\nalternating gentle reentrances and projections (Fig.\n\n1). Since then, barriers prograded within coastal\n\nreentrances and retreated mainly along the southern\n\nhalf of coastal projections. This contrasting behav-\n\nior could not be explained by sea level changes alone\n\nwhat would favor either progradation or retrograda-\n\ntion under a falling or rising condition, respectively.\n\nIn fact, sea level has remained stable or felt very\n\nslowly (about 2-4 m) in the last 5 ka, showing mi-\n\nnor interference on coastal evolution. The deposi-\n\ntional and erosional behavior of coastal reentrances\n\nand projections, respectively, has been explained by\n\nMay and Tanner (1973) using a graphical model for\n\nlittoral sediment transport. In general terms, the\n\nmodel explains how the coastline tends to flatten\n\nout its embayments and projections by wave action.\n\nDue to refraction, wave energy concentrates along\n\ncoastal projections while it is dispersed along the\n\nreentrances. As a result, coastal projections erode\n\nand the sediments are transported alongshore to be\n\ndeposited in adjacent embayments. Wave energy is\n\nenhanced along coastal projections also due to the\n\nsteeper adjacent shelf morphology that dissipates\n\nless energy by bottom friction (Wright 1974). As\n\nlong-term coastal erosion in Rio Grande do Sul is\n\nrestricted to protruding (steeper) sections of the\n\ncoast, it is believed that negative balances on sed-\n\niment budget due to wave energy concentration is\n\nan important factor driving barrier retrogradation.\n\nConsidering that shoreline orientation and di-\n\nrection of prevailing winds may have remained the\n\nsame throughout the Holocene to the present, the an-\n\ngle waves approach to the shoreline is a factor that\n\nmight have significant influence on both the long-\n\nand short-time scale. Lima et al. (2001) have esti-\n\nmated the potential littoral drift along the RS coast\n\nbased on wave measurements in deep water apply-\n\ning the Energy Flux Method (USACE 1984). Their\n\nresults show that higher potential of alongshore sedi-\n\nment transport is estimated to occur along the south-\n\nern half of coastal projections (where shoreline ori-\n\nentation is about N45?E), where intense coastal ero-\nsion is usually observed. Thus, shoreline orientation\n\nalso plays an important role on the littoral drift and\n\ncoastal erosion along the RS.\n\nShort Scale\n\nShort scale variations on sediment budget are\n\nrelated to natural and human-induced coastal pro-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)\n\n\n\nCOASTAL EROSION IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL 619\n\ncesses, such as offshore sand transport during storm\n\nsurges, concentration of wave energy due to sub-\n\nmerged small-scale features, and human activities.\n\nStorm Surges\n\nStorm surges occur when the passage of a coastal\n\nstorm induces water levels to exceed the predicted\n\ntide (Dolan and Davis 1994). In southern Brazil,\n\nthey occur when S-SE winds pile water onshore dur-\n\ning the passage of intense cold fronts. Storm surges\n\nare about 1.5-m high along the RS coast, where the\n\nhigher water level intensify the erosive capacity of\n\nstorm waves, causing severe damage at the coast\n\nmainly when simultaneous with high spring tides\n\n(Calliari et al. 1998b). This catastrophic combina-\n\ntion is more frequent in April and May and is more\n\ndestructive as it lasts longer (Calliari et al. 1998b).\n\nIt is also known that the frequency of storms is also\n\na factor that influences beach erosion (Fenster et al.\n\n2001).\n\nStudies addressing the occurrence and impact\n\nof storm surges in Brazil are scarce and limited to\n\nthe monitoring of individual events. Few examples\n\nare the storms of July 14, 1993 and April 19-21,\n\n1995 (Calliari et al. 1998b), April 3-5 and 24-26,\n\n1997 (Barletta and Calliari 2003), and April 16, 1999\n\n(Esteves et al. 2003a). The 1993 and the 1999\n\nstorms were very similar and consisted in extratrop-\n\nical cyclones formed after the passage of a cold front\n\nstriking the RS coast with average wind velocities\n\nof about 75 km/h, resulting in a storm surge of 1.3m\n\nand 0.8m (measured at the Rio Grande Port), respec-\n\ntively (Esteves et al. 2000). Beach profile measure-\n\nments showed that the 1993 and 1999 storms caused\n\nsubaerial beach erosion in Hermenegildo of 60 m3/m\n\nand 45 m3/m, respectively. Tozzi and Calliari (2000)\n\nobserved that maximum changes in sand volume oc-\n\ncur when the first fall storms (from March to June)\n\nerode the accreted profile built during the summer\n\nmonths (from December to March). Based on the\n\nresults of Tozzi (personal communication), Esteves\n\net al. (2000) stated that the storm of April 1999\n\nwas a typical example of the high-energy events\n\nthat threat Hermenegildo once a year. The num-\n\nber of cold fronts passages along the RS coast in the\n\nwinter months (June to August) from 1988 to 1998\n\nvaried from 6 to 14, with a mean of 10 for that pe-\n\nriod (Britto and Saraiva, personal communication).\n\nHowever, it is still lacking studies that show storms\n\ndistribution and frequency, related storm surges, and\n\nbeach profile responses in a longer term (do they\n\nfully recover?).\n\nConcentration of Wave Energy Due to Submerged\n\nSmall-Scale Features\n\nRecent studies have shown that convergence of\n\nwave rays due to refraction on small-scale changes\n\nin bathymetry concentrates wave energy at some\n\ncoastal sectors and is one of the probable causes of\n\nerosion in Rio Grande do Sul (Calliari et al. 1998a,\n\nSperanski and Calliari 2001). According to these\n\nstudies, convergence patterns in those two areas\n\nwere identified for waves with period longer than\n\n9 s approaching from SSE-SW while a divergent\n\npattern is observed in the northern shores. Speranski\n\nand Calliari (2001) suggest that wave \u201cfocus\u201d is the\n\nmajor cause of erosion in the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse\n\narea and in Hermenegildo. The authors have stated\n\nthat most of the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline is sta-\n\nble as concentration of wave energy is not observed\n\nalong most of the coast. However, this mechanism\n\ncould not explain erosion in Lagamarzinho, where\n\nBarletta and Calliari (2003) have estimated a retreat\n\nrate of 1m/yr. Based on Calliari et al. (2003) data,\n\nEsteves et al. (2002) estimated that wave refrac-\n\ntion may explain erosion along about 15% of the RS\n\ncoast, accretion along 2%, and a variable response\n\nalong 8% of the RS shoreline. These data do not\n\nimply that the remaining of the shoreline is stable,\n\nas other factors clearly contribute to changes in RS\n\nshorelines.\n\nHuman Activities\n\nDespite the long and undeveloped coastal segments,\n\nalmost one-third of the state shoreline have been im-\n\npacted by human activities, such as urbanization in\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)\n\n\n\n620 S\u00c9RGIO R. DILLENBURG, LUCIANA S. ESTEVES and LUIZ J. TOMAZELLI\n\nactive dune areas, shore armoring, sand mining, and\n\nconstruction of jetties (Esteves et al. 2000). Anthro-\n\npogenic activities affect local sand balance, more\n\nin a way of intensifying natural shoreline changes\n\nrather than generating them. For example, fixation\n\nof the Patos lagoon inlet by two 4-km long jetties\n\naccelerated accretion on updrift (southern) beaches\n\ndue to obstruction of the longshore sediment trans-\n\nport, an area that was already prograding in the long-\n\nterm (Dillenburg et al. 2000). In Hermenegildo,\n\nurbanization in the active beach/dune system and\n\ncoastal armoring seem to have aggravated erosion\n\nin a long-term retreating shoreline. Coastal devel-\n\nopment did not leave much space for natural beach\n\ndynamics to take place increasing the risk of struc-\n\ntures damage during storms (e.g. Tramanda\u00ed and\n\nHermenegildo). The artificial closure of natural\n\nwashouts might be another anthropogenic change\n\nthat tampers with local sand balance. In many\n\ncoastal communities, washouts were artificially\n\nclosed for road construction and tend to reopen tem-\n\nporarily during intense rainfall events. Sand from\n\nthe dune/beach system has been used for landfill\n\nand civil engineering purposes for a long time and,\n\nin some places, resulted in the complete removal of\n\ndunes. Although the impact of human activities in\n\nthe sand balance is still unknown, it seems to play a\n\nrole only in a local extent, enhancing natural trends\n\nrather than reversing them (Esteves et al. 2002).\n\nSUMMARY\n\nSandy barriers dominate the scenario along the 620-\n\nkm long Rio Grande do Sul coastline. The type\n\nand evolution of these barriers during the last 5 ka\n\nclearly indicate that sea level oscillations were not\n\nthe main factor controlling coastal evolution during\n\nthe Late Holocene. If that was the case, coastal\n\nbarriers would have evolved in a more uniform way.\n\nBecause minor or no sand is delivered by\n\nstreams to the coastal system in the last 5 ka, sed-\n\niment budget imbalances might have resulted from\n\nalongshore gradients of wave energy. Negative bal-\n\nances on sediment budget were produced by con-\n\ncentration and enhancing of wave energy that are\n\nthe main factors driving the retrogradation of bar-\n\nriers along coastal projections. In the other hand,\n\ndispersion and reduction of wave energy resulted\n\nin positive balances on the sediment budget, favor-\n\ning barrier progradation along coastal embayments.\n\nExtensive exhumation of lagoonal muds along the\n\nsouthern half of coastal projections (e.g. Bujuru\n\nand Hermenegildo), where shoreline orientation is\n\nN45?E, suggests that the appropriate angle of wave\nattack plays an important role on coastal erosion.\n\nAs pointed out by Lima et al. (2001), the highest\n\nrates of littoral drift occur along this shoreline\u2019s ori-\n\nentation. Therefore, there are evidences that erosion\n\nalong the RS shoreline is the continuity of a large-\n\nscale geological evolution operating in the last 5 ka;\n\nwith erosion being more intense along the southern\n\nhalf of gentle coastal projections.\n\nThe focusing of wave energy due to refrac-\n\ntion on small-scale submerged features, suggested\n\nby Calliari et al. (1998a) as the major cause of ero-\n\nsion in the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse and Hermenegildo,\n\nsounds reasonable to explain local erosion. How-\n\never, this process cannot explain the widespread\n\nlong-term erosion along most of the central RS coast,\n\nfrom Estreito to Lagamarzinho (Fig. 5). If erosion\n\nin Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse and Hermenegildo was due\n\nto wave refraction on small-scale features only, the\n\nshoreline should be locally reentrant, what is not\n\nthe case.\n\nThe short-term erosion detected from the anal-\n\nysis of 1997 and 2000 shorelines (mapped by DGPS)\n\nand a coastal chart of 1975 should be viewed cau-\n\ntiously. If erosion is really affecting approximately\n\n80% of the coast of Rio Grande do Sul (Toldo et al.\n\n1999, Esteves et al. 2002) a new explanation should\n\nbe formulated. The results presented by both au-\n\nthors show a high frequency alternation of coastal\n\nstretches under erosion, accretion, and stable. Such\n\nbehavior means that coastal processes are changing\n\ncontinuously along the coast and/or their relative\n\ndominance changes alongshore. If, in the future,\n\nthese results become more consistent with longer\n\nhistorical data (a decade or more) new factors driv-\n\nAn Acad Bras Cienc (2004) 76 (3)\n\n\n\nCOASTAL EROSION IN SOUTHERN BRAZIL 621\n\nFig. 5 \u2013 Coastline of Rio Grande do Sul showing the location of\n\nwidespread exposure of lagoonal muds and peat at the southern\n\nhalf of protruding (steeper) sections of the coast.\n\ning shoreline behavior should be investigated (e.g.\n\ncell circulation controlled by submerged features in\n\nthe shoreface or inner shelf).
