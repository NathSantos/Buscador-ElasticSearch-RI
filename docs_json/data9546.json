During the past years, it has become the most important source of energy in\n\nthe world, and it plays a prominent part in the maintenance of our modernised and\n\nindustrialised civilization. Therefore, the aim of this work is to analyse, understand\n\nand forecast the Brent prices behaviour, on a daily and monthly basis.\n\nTo model and forecast Brent prices, two di?erent approaches have been considered.\n\nIn the ?rst approach, the presence of long memory is tested in the conditional mean\n\nand modelled by using long memory time series models, namely ARFIMA models. The\n\nlong memory characteristic is also checked in the volatility, and it is modelled with FI-\n\nGARCH models, or some of their variants, namely FIAPARCH or FIEGARCH models.\n\nThe alternative approach considers stochastic regime-switching models, namely STAR,\n\nSETAR and MS-AR models.\n\nThe results obtained from the daily Brent prices analysis suggest that the data under\n\ninvestigation should be modelled with long memory time series, as there was evidence of\n\nlong-range dependence on the volatility of the Brent prices. Regime-switching models\n\nwere also applied to the daily data, but the hypothesis of non-linearity was rejected.\n\nRegarding the monthly Brent prices, neither conditional heteroskedasticity nor long-\n\nrange dependence were identi?ed. Regime-switching models were also considered, and\n\nin this case a two state model was identi?ed, showing clear di?erences between the\n\nachieved regimes.\n\nKeywords: Brent prices, Long memory time series models, Regime-switching models,\n\nForecasting.\n\nJEL Classi?cation: C23; Q43.\n\n\n\nSum\u00e1rio Executivo\n\nNos \u00faltimos anos, o Brent assumiu um papel preponderante na nossa sociedade, tornan?\n\ndo-se na fonte de energia mais importante para a sobreviv\u00eancia da nossa actual ci?\n\nviliza\u00e7\u00e3o. O seu forte impacto na sociedade contribui para a necessidade de melhor\n\ncompreender o comportamento dos seus pre\u00e7os, de forma a permitir, com maior exacti?\n\nd\u00e3o, antever a sua tend\u00eancia futura. Assim, o objectivo desta an\u00e1lise \u00e9 modelar e\n\nprever os pre\u00e7os di\u00e1rios e mensais do Brent. Para o efeito, foram consideradas duas\n\nmetodologias distintas: modelos de s\u00e9ries temporais com mem\u00f3ria longa e modelos de\n\nmudan\u00e7a de regime.\n\nA primeira metodologia consiste na veri?ca\u00e7\u00e3o da presen\u00e7a de mem\u00f3ria longa na\n\nm\u00e9dia condicional da s\u00e9rie em an\u00e1lise, procedendo-se \u00e0 sua modela\u00e7\u00e3o com base em\n\nmodelos ARFIMA (Autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average). Esta carac-\n\nter\u00edstica \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m analisada na vari\u00e2ncia condicional dos dados, procedendo-se neste\n\ncaso \u00e0 aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos FIGARCH (Fractionally Integrated Generalized Autore-\n\ngressive conditional heteroskedastic), FIAPARCH (Fractionally Integrated Asymmetric\n\nPower ARCH) ou FIEGARCH (Fractionally Integrated Exponential GARCH). A outra\n\nabordagem permite analisar se o comportamento dos pre\u00e7os do Brent pode ser descrito\n\npor diferentes regimes, sendo considerados dois mecanismos de mudan\u00e7a de regime. O\n\nprimeiro assume que a transi\u00e7\u00e3o entre regimes \u00e9 determinada por uma vari\u00e1vel obser?\n\nv\u00e1vel e, neste caso, consideram-se modelos STAR (Smooth transition autoregressive)\n\nou SETAR (Self-exciting threshold autoregressive). Quanto ao segundo, em que a tran-\n\nsi\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 dependente de uma vari\u00e1vel n\u00e3o observ\u00e1vel, aplicam-se os modelos MS-AR\n\n(Markov-switching autoregressive).\n\nOs resultados di\u00e1rios sugerem que a s\u00e9rie de pre\u00e7os de Brent deve ser modelada\n\natrav\u00e9s de modelos de s\u00e9ries temporais com mem\u00f3ria longa, uma vez que esta ca?\n\nracter\u00edstica foi identi?cada na vari\u00e2ncia condicional dos dados. Como modelo ?nal\n\nescolheu-se o FIGARCH(1,1) aplicado aos retornos da s\u00e9rie di\u00e1ria de pre\u00e7os, dado ter\n\nsido o modelo que apresentou maior capacidade preditiva quando aplicado o teste de\n\nDiebold-Mariano. Os modelos de mudan\u00e7a de regime foram tamb\u00e9m aplicados \u00e0 s\u00e9rie.\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nNo entanto a rejei\u00e7\u00e3o da hip\u00f3tese de n\u00e3o-linearidade permite concluir que os pre\u00e7os\n\ndi\u00e1rios do Brent devem ser analisados com base em modelos lineares.\n\nAs conclus\u00f5es obtidas pela an\u00e1lise dos pre\u00e7os mensais de Brent s\u00e3o bastante dife?\n\nrentes das alcan\u00e7adas no caso da an\u00e1lise di\u00e1ria. A aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos de s\u00e9ries\n\ntemporais permitiu a identi?ca\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo AR(6) para os retornos mensais,\n\nn\u00e3o se veri?cando nem heteroscedasticidade condicional nos res\u00edduos do modelo, nem\n\nmem\u00f3ria longa na m\u00e9dia e vari\u00e2ncia condicional da s\u00e9rie em an\u00e1lise. Os modelos de\n\nmudan\u00e7a de regime foram tamb\u00e9m aplicados e optou-se pelo modelo SETAR(2) de\n\ndois estados, uma vez que foi o que apresentou maior capacidade preditiva quando\n\naplicado o teste de Diebold-Mariano. Este modelo \u00e9 bastante interessante pois permite\n\numa clara distin\u00e7\u00e3o entre os dois regimes identi?cados. Enquanto o primeiro regime,\n\nconstitu\u00eddo pela maioria das observa\u00e7\u00f5es, apresenta pre\u00e7os mensais menos elevados e\n\ncom maior varia\u00e7\u00e3o, o segundo regime \u00e9 composto por pre\u00e7os mais elevados e com uma\n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o menor. Veri?ca-se, tamb\u00e9m, que o primeiro regime tem uma dura\u00e7\u00e3o de quase\n\ndois anos e o segundo dura apenas poucos meses.\n\nNesta an\u00e1lise n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel identi?car uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre as mudan\u00e7as de regime\n\ne presen\u00e7a de mem\u00f3ria longa. No entanto, num estudo futuro, poder\u00e1 ser bastante\n\ninte?ressante estudar-se a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de modelos de mudan\u00e7a de regime \u00e0 vari\u00e2ncia\n\ncondicional dos pre\u00e7os di\u00e1rios do Brent.\n\nEm seguida, apresentamos as contribui\u00e7\u00f5es desta tese para a literatura econom\u00e9trica\n\ne ?nanceira no \u00e2mbito da an\u00e1lise e previs\u00e3o de pre\u00e7os de Brent. O primeiro ponto a\n\nreferir \u00e9 a an\u00e1lise e compara\u00e7\u00e3o das previs\u00f5es obtidas pelos modelos de s\u00e9ries temporais\n\ncom mem\u00f3ria longa e modelos de mudan\u00e7a de regime.\n\nRelativamente aos modelos de s\u00e9ries temporais, foram utilizados diversos modelos\n\nna modela\u00e7\u00e3o dos retornos dos pre\u00e7os do Brent, alguns dos quais (por exemplo, o\n\nFIAPARCH e FIEGARCH) pouco usuais no \u00e2mbito da literatura econom\u00e9trica. \u00c9 de\n\nreferir, tamb\u00e9m, que a mem\u00f3ria longa \u00e9 testada simultaneamente na m\u00e9dia e vari\u00e2ncia\n\ncondicional. Quanto aos modelos de mudan\u00e7a de regime, investigamos se os pre\u00e7os do\n\nBrent s\u00e3o melhor caracterizados pelo seu comportamento passado ou por uma vari\u00e1vel\n\ndesconhecida e n\u00e3o observ\u00e1vel.\n\nOutro aspecto interessante \u00e9 a an\u00e1lise paralela efectuada para os dados di\u00e1rios\n\ne mensais, que leva a conclus\u00f5es bastante interessantes e distintas. Por ?m, e de\n\nforma a comparar a capacidade preditiva dos modelos, utiliza-se, como complemento\n\n\u00e0s tradicionais medidas de an\u00e1lise de previs\u00e3o, o teste de Diebold-Mariano para testar\n\nse as diferen\u00e7as de previs\u00e3o entre os v\u00e1rios modelos identi?cados s\u00e3o estatisticamente\n\nsigni?cativas.\n\nv\n\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nFirst of all I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Dias Curto for his guidance\n\nand support which were extremely helpful.

Nowadays, it plays an important part in our society, as it supports the main-\n\ntenance of the industrialised civilization as we know it, being a major issue of concern\n\nthat has a very high impact on economy, politics, industry and technology.\n\nThe Brent1 blend is a light crude oil that contains approximately 0.37% of sulphur,\n\nclassifying it as sweet crude, and it is ideal for the production of gasoline and middle\n\ndistillates. It is typically re?ned in Northwest Europe, but it can also be re?ned in\n\nEast or Gulf coasts of the United States or in the Mediterranean region if the prices\n\nare good enough to export.\n\nDuring the past years, especially in the last two years, the behaviour of the Brent\n\nprices has been characterised by high volatility. For example, in July 2008 it reached\n\nthe 145 USD/bbl and six months latter it fell to 38 USD/bbl. However, according to\n\nthe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) the high Brent prices\n\nin the 2008 year cannot be justi?ed by the fundamentals of physical and demand, which\n\nmake them even harder to model and predict.\n\nIn our study we try to analyse and understand the Brent prices by studying the\n\nlong memory characteristic or, in other words, the long-range dependence in the data\n\nset. The presence of long memory is tested in the conditional mean and modelled by\n\nusing long memory time series models, namely autoregressive fractionally integrated\n\nmoving average (ARFIMA) models. The long memory characteristic is also tested in\n\nthe prices volatility, and in this case we model it with fractionally integrated general-\n\n1The name ?Brent? comes from the naming policy of Shell UK Exploration and Production, oper-\nating on behalf of Exxon and Shell, which originally named all of its ?elds after birds (in this case the\nBrent Goose).\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (FIGARCH) models, or some of their\n\nvariants, namely fractionally integrated asymmetric power ARCH (FIAPARCH) or\n\nfractionally integrated exponential GARCH (FIEGARCH) models.\n\nAdditionally, several authors have mentioned a strong relation between the long\n\nmemory characteristic and stochastic regime-switching models, considering very hard\n\nand complex to distinguish between long-range dependence and structural breaks. So,\n\nbesides the long memory time series models, we also analyse regime-switching mod-\n\nels. Regarding this class of models, we focus on the smooth transition autoregressive\n\n(STAR), self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR) and Markov-switching autore-\n\ngressive (MS-AR) models.\n\nWe now summarise the content and organization of this dissertation.\n\nIn Chapter 2 we present a brief literature review of the modelling techniques we\n\nfollow in order to better understand, model and predict the Brent prices. We refer\n\nto studies that apply the same methods, namely long memory time series models and\n\nregime-switching models.\n\nIn Chapter 3 we give a brief description of the methods we use for modelling the\n\nBrent prices data set. We consider long memory time series models, such as ARFIMA\n\nmodels, for the conditional mean, and FIGARCH and its variants, namely FIAPARCH\n\nand FIEGARCH, models for the conditional variance. We also introduce and describe\n\nregime-switching models, like STAR, SETAR and MS-AR models. First, we present\n\na brief theoretical introduction of each modelling technique, and then we provide the\n\nmethodology we follow to analyse and understand the Brent prices behaviour.\n\nIn Chapter 4 we present the empirical results. We start by introducing our time\n\nseries, and two data sets are analysed: the daily and monthly Brent prices. We use\n\ndata from the beginning of January 2000 until the end of December 2009, and, in\n\norder to better understand the behaviour of both data sets, a descriptive analysis\n\nis performed and the presence of outliers is tested. Then we model the data sets\n\nconsidering long memory time series models and regime-switching models following\n\nclosely the methodology described in Chapter 3. After identifying and validating several\n\nmodels we proceed to the model forecasting, and we consider both in-sample and out-\n\nof-sample prediction methods. At last, and having the forecasts of the di?erent models,\n\nwe are able to assess the prediction accuracy of all proposed models in order to choose\n\nthe best model. We apply the traditional criteria (MAPE, RMSE) but we also use the\n\nDiebold-Mariano test to compare the predictive ability of the proposed models.\n\nFinally, in Chapter 5 we draw some conclusions and present the main contributions\n\nof this thesis.\n\n2\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nLiterature Review\n\nIn this chapter we present a brief literature review of the methodologies we apply to\n\nmodel and predict the Brent prices. In our analysis we focus on two main approaches:\n\nlong memory time series models and regime-switching models. Next, we brie?y review\n\nsome studies concerning these modelling techniques.\n\nThe long memory characteristic, also known as long-range dependence, translates\n\na high degree of persistence in the observed data, and the fact of time series exhibiting\n\nlong memory is becoming more common. In fact, in the recent past, long memory\n\nhas been found in time series from many ?elds, such as hydrology, meteorology and\n\n?nancial economics, among others.\n\nThe ?rst study concerning this phenomenon was originally noticed by Hurst (1951).\n\nThe author identi?ed the presence of long-range dependence in hydrology while exam-\n\nining yearly discharges of the Nile River and measuring the long-term storage capacity\n\nof the reservoirs. Latter, many other authors, namely Mandelbrot and Wallis (1968)\n\nstudied this e?ect, providing several studies related with data persistence in many\n\nnatural science ?elds, like hydrology, meteorology, etc.\n\nHowever, this phenomenon is not exclusive of non-?nancial time series. Long mem-\n\nory has become another stylised fact of ?nancial time series, especially in terms of\n\nvolatility. The growing necessity of analysing this kind of behaviour has lead to an in-\n\ncreasing number of studies on this topic in order to better understand this phenomenon.\n\nMany authors, namely Baillie (1996), Beran (1994) and Robinson (2003), present an\n\nintroduction on this subject as well as a discussion on several ways on how to estimate\n\nlong-range dependence. Robinson (2003) edited a book with a collection of articles\n\nregarding a variety of topics concerning long memory time series. Baillie (1996), refers\n\nto applications in geophysical sciences, macroeconomics, assets pricing, stock returns,\n\nand exchange and interest rates, discussing also the ARFIMA models introduced by\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nHosking (1981) that are used to describe the long memory in the conditional mean of\n\nthe processes. Modelling long-range dependence in volatility is also done, by proposing\n\nextensions of the conditional heteroskedastic models to fractionally integrated models,\n\nnamely FIGARCH and FIEGARCH processes.\n\nConcerning other ?elds of natural sciences, Viswanathan et al. (1997) used long-\n\nrange correlation measures when analysing the DNA patchiness. A very detailed study\n\nhas been presented by Braun (2010) who developed a PhD. thesis on long memory\n\napplied to psychological behaviour. Besides all these non-?nancial analysis, the fact\n\nis that the long memory phenomenon is becoming a common issue when analysing\n\n?nancial data. Baillie and Chung (1996) present a study where the in?ation for ten\n\ncountries is analysed considering fractionally integrated ARMA ? GARCH models.\nThese models are also used by Korkmaz et al. (2009) to analyse Istanbul stock exchange\n\nreturns, and in this study, the author concludes that although long memory does not\n\nexist in the equity return, it exists in the volatility. A variant of these models has\n\nbeen proposed by Tse (1998), who examines the conditional heteroskedasticity of the\n\nyen-dollar exchange rate by considering FIAPARCH models.\n\nAlthough there are a wide range of studies in several ?elds concerning the long\n\nmemory phenomenon, one topic underrepresented in the literature is the long-range\n\ndependence applied to the Brent prices. However, Chaouachi (2005) developed a very\n\ninteresting study on this topic, by searching for long memory in the Brent time series.\n\nThe analysis suggests that long-range dependence is only present on the time series\n\nvolatility, and therefore the author proposes modelling the conditional mean of the\n\nprocess with ARMA models, and its volatility with models that consider the long\n\nmemory phenomenon, namely FIAPARCH models.\n\nAnother interesting paper was proposed by Medeiros and Scharth (2009) who anal-\n\nyse asymmetric e?ects and long memory in the volatility of Dow Jones stocks. This\n\nanalysis focuses our interest, not due to the subject, but because the authors concluded\n\nthat fractionally integrated models are an incomplete description of the volatility pro-\n\ncess, and their empirical results showed that multiple regime-switching modelling could\n\nbe a promising alternative for these kind of applications. Like this author, many oth-\n\ners, namely Diebold and Inoue (2001), Granger and Hyung (2004), and Banerjee and\n\nUrga (2005), consider a parallel analysis on long memory and structural breaks, and\n\nthe reasoning is quite interesting and simple. In fact, according to Granger and Hyung\n\n(2004) theory and simulation results show that it is very complex to distinguish be-\n\ntween the long memory characteristic and structural breaks on the data set, and that\n\nneglecting breaks may generate a long memory e?ect in the autocorrelation function.\n\n4\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nThe authors analyse the S&amp;P 500 absolute stock returns by comparing the results from\n\nthe two di?erent methodologies, and they concluded that the performance of both kind\n\nof models for the in-sample and out-of sample forecasts are quite similar, showing no\n\nstatistical di?erence.\n\nDiebold and Inoue (2001) also argue that regime-switching is easily confused with\n\nlong memory, and present a theoretical and Monte Carlo study which corroborate the\n\nidea that stochastic regime-switching and long memory are strongly related.\n\nConsidering this relation, in our study we will not only use long memory time series\n\nmodels but also regime-switching models.\n\nRegarding regime-switching models, di?erent approaches are being presented. En-\n\ngle and Hamilton (1990), in order to analyse the behaviour of the dollar exchange\n\nrate, consider a model which assumes the existence of an unobservable variable that\n\ncharacterises the regime in which the process is at time t, and depending on the value\n\nof this variable, the data assumes di?erent characteristics. As the evolution of the\n\nunobservable variable is based on a Markov chain, this class of models is a particular\n\ncase of the regime-switching models, and is referred to as Markov-switching models.\n\nA variant of this class of models is proposed by Caraiani (2010). The author, using a\n\ntwo-state Markov-switching autoregressive (MS-AR) approach, analyses and predicts\n\nthe business cycle in the Romanian economy. The achieved results show that the\n\nmacroeconomic dynamics in the Romanian economy can be very well explained and\n\nforecasted when using regime-switching models. Schindlmayr (2005) also proposes a\n\nMS-AR model applied to the daily electricity spot prices from the European Energy\n\nExchange. The author identi?es two di?erent regimes, one characterised by the nor-\n\nmal behaviour of the data, and the other by the price spikes with a high volatility\n\nand strong mean-reversion. Another MS-AR model is presented by Hardy (2001), who\n\nanalyses the monthly data from the Standard and Poor's 500 and the Toronto Stock\n\nexchange 300 indices.\n\nA di?erent type of Markov-switching models has been proposed by Dafas (2004)\n\nwho tries to characterise the stochastic behaviour of crude oil prices. The author, using\n\nmarket data of international crude oil spot prices for the last seventeen years, calibrates\n\na mean-reverting Markov regime-switching jump-di?usion model and estimates its pa-\n\nrameters using the Hamilton ?lter. A di?erent study, also considering commodities,\n\nhas been proposed by Chen and Forsyth (2010). The authors propose a one-factor\n\nregime-switching model for natural gas spot prices and analyse the implication of the\n\nmodel on the valuation and optimal operations of a natural gas storage facility. Each\n\nmodel follows either a mean-reverting process or a Brownian motion, and the obtained\n\n5\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nresults seemed to re?ect the gas prices dynamics in each regime.\n\nA di?erent approach, considering regime-switching models, is proposed by Dijk\n\net al. (2002) and consists on the smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) time series\n\nmodels, as well as some of their variants, namely the logistic STAR (LSTAR) and\n\nthe self-exciting threshold AR (SETAR) models. The authors, after providing a rich\n\nintroduction and discussion on these models, present an empirical example concerning\n\nthe US unemployment. The behaviour of the US unemployment rate series is modelled\n\nand analysed, and several extensions of the STAR models are performed in order to\n\nchoose the best model. Another study concerning the SETAR models is proposed\n\nby Boero and Marrocu (2004). The authors, using daily data of the Euro e?ective\n\nexchange rate, evaluate the out-of-sample performance of SETAR models relative to\n\nan AR-GARCH model. The results show that the SETAR models have signi?cantly\n\nimproved the forecasting performance when the forecast origin was conditioned on a\n\nspeci?c regime.\n\nA very interesting analysis is presented by Ismail and Isa (2006), who model the\n\nmonthly returns of exchange rates of three Asian countries (Malaysia, Singapore, and\n\nThailand) against the British pound using two types of regime-switching models: MS-\n\nAR and SETAR models. After comparing the results of the two classes of models,\n\nthe authors concluded that the ?tting of the MS-AR model is better than the SETAR\n\nmodel, and also that the regime-switching models outperform linear models in terms\n\nof ?tting returns. In our study, like in this previous one, we will also consider and\n\ncompare these two types of regime-switching models.\n\n6\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nDescription of Models\n\nIn this chapter we provide a brief description of the methodologies we follow when\n\nanalysing, modelling and forecasting Brent prices.\n\nIn the ?rst section, Section 3.1, we introduce time series models that exhibit long\n\nmemory and in Section 3.2 we describe the regime-switching models. For each section\n\nwe present a brief theoretical introduction of each approach, as well as the methodology\n\nwe follow to analyse and understand the Brent prices behaviour. As we only give an\n\noverview of the used techniques, along each section we provide references for a more\n\ndetailed analysis.\n\nFinally, in Section 3.3 we present several procedures in order to evaluate the pre-\n\ndiction ability that will help us when selecting the ?nal model.\n\n3.1 Long Memory Time Series Models\n\nAs the main purpose of this study is to analyse and characterise the Brent prices\n\nbehaviour, we will consider long memory time series models by testing long-range\n\ndependence not only on the ?rst moment (mean), but also in terms of the variance\n\n(that represents volatility).\n\nTherefore in Subsection 3.1.1 we present a general introduction to long memory\n\ntime series models. We start by introducing the long memory concept, and next\n\nwe give a brief description on the models we use: the autoregressive fractionally in-\n\ntegrated autoregressive moving average (ARFIMA) model for the conditional mean\n\nanalysis, and some variants of the autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (ARCH)\n\nmodel for the conditional variance modelling, namely the fractionally integrated gener-\n\nalized ARCH (FIGARCH), asymmetric power ARCH (FIAPARCH), and fractionally\n\nintegrated exponential generalized ARCH (FIEGARCH) models. In the last section,\n\nSubsection 3.1.2, we present the methodology followed in the Brent prices modelling\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nconsidering long memory time series models.\n\n3.1.1 Introduction\n\nLong memory, also known as long-range dependence, is traditionally de?ned either in\n\nthe time domain or in the frequency domain. In terms of time domain it results on a\n\ndecaying rate of autocorrelation functions (with special interest on the long lags). As\n\ndescribed by Beran (1994), let X = {Xt; t ? Z} be a stationary process, then if there\nexists a constant c > 0 and ? ? (0, 1) such that\n\nlim\nk??\n\n?k\nck??\n\n= 1, (3.1)\n\nthen X is a stationary process with long memory, where ?k are the autocorrelation\n\ncoe?cients of order k. A more general de?nition has been proposed by McLeod and\n\nHipel (1978) and considers that\n\nlim\nn??\n\nn?\nj=?n\n\n|?j| = ?, (3.2)\n\nwhere n corresponds to the number of observations and ?j to the autocorrelation coef-\n\n?cients.\n\nOther de?nition involving frequency domain considers the spectral density of the\n\nprocess. Therefore, let X = {Xt; t ? Z} be a stationary process and f be the spectral\ndensity. If there is a constant cf > 0 and ? ? (0, 1) such that the condition\n\nlim\n???\n\nf?\ncf|?|??\n\n= 1 (3.3)\n\nveri?es, then the process X exhibits long memory, or long-range dependence.\n\nAfter de?ning the long memory concept, we present a class of models that are able\n\nto capture long-range dependence in the conditional mean of a process: the ARFIMA\n\nmodels. However, before referring these models, we present a brief introduction on\n\nautoregressive moving average (ARMA) models. Following Box and Jenkins (1976)\n\nand Wei (1990), a stationary process X = {Xt; t ? Z} is de?ned as an ARMA(p, q)\nmodel if\n\n?p(L)(Xt ? \u00b5) = ?q(L)?t, (3.4)\n\nwhere p, q ? N0, \u00b5 is the process mean, L is such that LjXt = Xt?j (commonly known as\n\n8\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nlag operator), and {?t; t ? Z} ? WN(0, ?2? ). The terms ?p(L) and ?q(L) are respectively\nthe autoregressive and moving average polynomials, given by ?p(L) = 1 ?\n\n?p\nj=1 ?jL\n\nj\n\nand ?q(L) = 1 ?\n?q\n\nj=1 ?jL\nj.\n\nHowever in many situations instead of a stationary series, we deal with non-stationary\n\nbehaviour, and therefore we need to consider the ARFIMA models, discussed in Baillie\n\n(1996), and given by\n\n?p(L)(1 ? L)d(Xt ? \u00b5) = ?q(L)?t, (3.5)\n\nwith d being the fractional di?erencing parameter, and where \u00b5, ?p(L), ?q(L), and ?\n\nare as previously de?ned. Note that the roots of ?p(L) and ?q(L) lie outside the unit\n\ncircle. For ?0.5 &lt;d &lt;0.5 the process is covariance stationary, for d &lt;1 is mean\nreverting, and for 0 &lt;d &lt;0.5 it is assumed to have long memory. The Equation (3.5)\n\ncan be reduced to a stable ARMA process when d = 0, and to an ARIMA model when\n\nd = 1. So we can conclude, and as referred by Brunetti (1999), that the ARFIMA\n\nmodels are, in fact, very ?exible as they can capture both long memory (by estimating\n\nthe d parameter) and short term memory (considering the dynamics captured by the\n\nautoregressive and moving average polynomials).\n\nThe relevant issues previously discussed when dealing with long-range dependence\n\nin the ?rst moment of a process, are also important and necessary when focusing on\n\nthe second moment, its volatility. As the assumption of homoskedastic errors is not\n\nalways valid, Engle (1982), in order to overcome this situation, proposed the autore-\n\ngressive conditional heteroskedastic (ARCH) model. Latter a generalisation of this\n\nclass of models was proposed by Bollerslev (1986), introducing the generalized ARCH\n\n(GARCH) model. A GARCH(p, q) process is de?ned as\n\n?t = ?t\n?\nht\n\nht = ?0 +\n\nq?\ni=1\n\n?i?\n2\nt?1 +\n\np?\ni=1\n\n?iht?i (3.6)\n\n= ?0 + A(L)?\n2\nt + B(L)ht\n\nwith {?t} ? iid(0, 1) and\n\np ? 0, q > 0,\n\n?0 > 0, ?i ? 0, i = 1, . . . , q (3.7)\n\n?i ? 0, i = 1, . . . , p.\n\nThe GARCH(p, q) model can also be expressed as an ARMA(m, q) process in ?2t ac-\n\n9\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\ncording to\n\n?(L)?2t = ?0 + (1 ? ?(L))?t, (3.8)\n\nwhere ?t = ?\n2\nt ? ?2t corresponds to the innovations in the conditional variance process,\n\nm = max(p, q), and ?(L) = {1 ? ?(L) ? ?(L)}.\nLike in the analysis of the ?rst moment of a process, long memory and persistence\n\ncan also be characteristics of the conditional variance of a process. Therefore, and\n\nin order to capture the long-range dependence Baillie et al. (1996) proposed the frac-\n\ntional integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) model. A FIGARCH(p, d, q) process can be\n\nrepresented as\n\n?(L)(1 ? L)d?2t = ?0 + (1 ? ?(L))?t, (3.9)\n\nwhere all roots of ?(L) and {1 ? ?(L)} lie outside the unit circle. When d = 0 the\nEquation (3.9) of the FIGARCH process reduces to a GARCH model, while when\n\nd = 1, we get an IGARCH process.\n\nAs, in ?nancial markets, frequently occurs that positive and negative shocks have a\n\ndi?erent impact on the volatility, meaning that usually a negative event (bad news) con-\n\nducts to higher volatility than a positive one. This phenomenon is named as leverage ef-\n\nfect, see Black (1976). Therefore, Tse (1998) proposed a model that are able to capture\n\nboth, the volatility asymmetric behaviour and the long memory presence: the fractional\n\nintegrated asymmetric power ARCH (FIAPARCH) model. A FIAPARCH(p, d, q) pro-\n\ncess is, then, given by\n\n(1 ? L)d?(L)g(?t)? = ?0 + (1 ? ?(L))?t (3.10)\n\nwhere ?t = g(?t)\n? ? ??t , g(?t) = |?t| ? ??t, with ? > 0, ? ? 0, |?| &lt;1, and all the other\n\nterms are as previously de?ned. If the asymmetry parameter, ?, is positive (negative)\n\nthen it indicates that negative (positive) shocks conducts to higher volatility than\n\npositive (negative) ones.\n\nAnother model that can capture the non-symmetric behaviour, was proposed by\n\nBollerslev and Mikkelsen (1996) and represents an extension of the FIGARCH model\n\nbased on the exponential GARCH model previously introduced by Nelson (1991). The\n\ndeveloped model is a fractional integrated exponential GARCH (FIEGARCH) model,\n\nand a FIEGARCH(p, d, q) process can be written as\n\nlog(?2t ) = ?0 + ?(L)\n?1(1 ? L)?d[1 ? ?(L)]g(?t?1), (3.11)\n\n10\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nwith\n\ng(?t) = ??t + ?[|?t| ? E|?t|]. (3.12)\n\nWe stress that all roots of ?(L) and ?(L) lie outside the unit circle, and if we\n\nconsider d = 0, the Equation (3.11) simpli?es to an EGARCH model.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation on these matters we refer to Baillie (1996), Brunetti\n\n(1999), Diebold and Inoue (2001), Breidt et al. (1998), Robinson (1995) and Banerjee\n\nand Urga (2005).\n\n3.1.2 Modelling Methodology\n\nIn this subsection we present our methodology in the Brent prices modelling and fore-\n\ncasting, considering long memory time series models.\n\nMany authors divide the time series modelling methodology in several steps (see, for\n\nexample, Wei (1990)), and in this thesis we follow the same procedure, but we introduce\n\nsome variants in order to better achieve our purpose. Therefore the following steps are\n\nthe ones considered in our analysis:\n\n1. Stationarity and long memory testing;\n\n2. Model identi?cation and validation; and\n\n3. Forecasting and model selection.\n\nNext we brie?y describe each of the points referred above.\n\n1. Stationarity and long memory testing\n\nBefore testing for the presence of long memory in our time series, it is necessary to\n\ncheck if the data has a stationary behaviour.\n\nAlthough a process can be non-stationary in the mean, variance, or in other mo-\n\nments, in this study we only analyse and deal with mean and variance non-stationary\n\nbehaviour. Therefore, and since a process can be stationary in the mean but not\n\nnecessarily in the variance, it is a common practice to deal ?rstly with the variance\n\nnon-stationary behaviour and only afterwards test if it is necessary to apply a mean\n\nstabilising transformation.\n\nThere are several transformations that can be applied in order to stabilise and\n\nhomogenise the variance. The most common transformation is the Box-Cox's power\n\n11\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\ntransformation proposed by Box and Cox (1964), and that is given by\n\nT?(Xt) =\n\n{\nX?t ?1\n\n?\n, ? ?= 0,\n\nlog(Xt), ? = 0\n(3.13)\n\nwhere {Xt} is the original data set, and ? ? [?1, 1] is the transformation parameter.\nThe best transformation corresponds to the value of ? that minimises the sample\n\nvariance of the transformed series. For more details on this procedure we refer to Pires\n\n(2001). We recall that in ?nancial markets, the logarithmic transformation is the most\n\ncommonly used.\n\nThe following step, after stabilising the variance, is to test if the mean non-stationarity\n\nremains. This can be accomplished in several ways: by analysing the empirical autocor-\n\nrelation function (ACF) or partial autocorrelation function (PACF); or by computing\n\nsome tests (implemented in several softwares, namely R and Eviews). The tests used\n\nin this study are the Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (KPSS) test, the Aug-\n\nmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) unit root test, and the Phillips-Perron (PP) unit root\n\ntest. All tests are available in the R Software, as well as in Eviews, so for more details\n\non these tests we refer to Trapletti (2005) and Software (2009), respectively.\n\nWhen the mean non-stationarity is con?rmed it is necessary to apply a di?erencing\n\noperator ?kXt = Xt ? Xt?k, possibly more than once, or of k order, with the purpose\nof removing, respectively, any trend or cyclic component (of k order).\n\nNow that the series is stationary, it is possible to check for the presence of short or\n\nlong memory. There are several tests to check for the presence of long memory in a time\n\nseries, and one of the oldest methods is the rescaled-range, or simply R/S, statistic.\n\nThis measure was ?rstly introduced by Hurst (1951) and then developed and re?ned by\n\nMandelbrot and Wallis (1968). The R/S statistic corresponds to the range of partial\n\nsums of deviations of a time series from the mean, rescaled by its standard deviation.\n\nTherefore, consider a time series X = {Xt, t = 1, . . . , T}, where T corresponds to the\nnumber of observations. In order to evaluate the R/S statistic, after subdividing our\n\ndata set into ? partitions we de?ne, for each partition, its range (R) according to\n\nRT =\n\n{\nmax\n1?i?T\n\ni?\nt=1\n\n(xt ? x) ? min\n1?i?T\n\ni?\nt=1\n\n(xt ? x)\n\n}\n, (3.14)\n\nwhere x is the sample mean of the data set. The sample standard deviation is also\n\ndetermined, and, for each partition, we obtain the R/S statistic. As referred in Man-\n\n12\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\ndelbrot and Wallis (1968) this statistic follows asymptotically\n\n(R/S)s ? CsH. (3.15)\n\nIn order to estimate the parameter H, and according to Grau-Carles (2005), it is usual\n\nto run a linear regression over the growing temporal horizons, s = t1, t2, . . . , T , each\n\nreferring to its respective partition,\n\nln(R/S)s = ln(C) + H ln(s). (3.16)\n\nIf the H estimated value is 0.5 we can conclude that the process has short memory,\n\nif the estimate is within the (0.5, 1) interval then it is a stationary process with long\n\nmemory, and if the H parameter is between (0, 0.5), the process is anti-persistent1.\n\nMany authors identify a relation between the H parameter and the di?erencing pa-\n\nrameter d. In case of an in?nite variance process the relation is given by H = d + 1\n?\n,\n\nbut in the case of a ?nite variance process, the relation is simply H = d + 1\n2\n. For a\n\nmore detailed analysis see Chaouachi (2005) and Grau-Carles (2005).\n\nA methodology to estimate the H parameter was developed and implemented by\n\nWuertz (2009) and is available in the R Software. However many authors, namely\n\nLo (1991), point out the incapacity of this statistic to distinguish between long and\n\nshort memory. Therefore, and to overcome the lack of robustness of the R/S statistic,\n\ndi?erent statistics are also used.\n\nA di?erent methodology has been proposed by Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983)\n\nand is based on the spectral density function. The idea behind this method is that,\n\nfor models applied to stationary time series, the spectral density function is bounded\n\nat zero frequency, while for long memory models it becomes unbounded at frequency\n\n? = 0. Therefore Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) proposes to estimate d according\n\nto\n\nln{I(?j,T )} = ln\n{\n?2fu(0)\n\n2?\n\n}\n? d ln\n\n{\n4 sin2\n\n(\n?j,T\n2\n\n)}\n(3.17)\n\n+ ln\n\n{\nfu(?j,T )\n\nfu(0)\n\n}\n+ ln\n\n{\nI(?j,T )\n\nfu(?j,T )\n\n}\n,\n\nwhere I(?j,T ) and fu(?j,T ) are respectively the periodogram and the spectral den-\n\nsity function of the time series at frequencies ?j,T = (2?j)/T, with ? = 1, . . . , T ,\n\nand T corresponds to the number of observations of the series. Considering that\n\n1A anti-persistent time series reverses more often than a random series would be.\n\n13\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nln{4 sin2(?j,T /2)} is the explanatory variable, ln{I(?j,T )/fu(?j,T )} is the disturbance\nterm, and the remaining two terms correspond to the intercept term, (3.17) can be\n\nsimply represented, as Grau-Carles (2005) proposed, by\n\nln{I(?j,T )} = ?0 + ?1 ln\n{\n4 sin2\n\n(\n?j,T\n2\n\n)}\n+ u?j,T . (3.18)\n\nTherefore the proposed estimator for d, is the slope coe?cient obtained in the least\n\nsquares regression of ln{I(?j,T )} on ln{4 sin2(?j,T /2)}.\nA very similar statistic, proposed by Robinson (1994), is also computed. It is\n\navailable in the TSM software and was implemented by Davidson (2010). This statistic\n\ngives a semi-parametric estimate of the H parameter (which can be related to the d as\n\npreviously described) through\n\nH?mq = 1 ?\nln F?(q?m)/F?(?m)\n\n2 ln q\n(3.19)\n\nwhere F is the average periodogram function, q must be restricted to the interval (0, 1)\n\nand it is assumed to be 0.5, and ?m = 2?T\n?0.35.\n\n2. Model identi?cation and validation\n\nAfter estimating the long memory parameter (d) we are able to proceed to the\n\nmodel identi?cation. The initial step is to model the long-range dependence in the\n\n?rst conditional moment of the process, meaning that an adequate ARFIMA model\n\nshall be adjusted to the already stationary time series. The orders of the autoregressive\n\nand moving average parameters can be identi?ed by analysing the autocorrelation and\n\npartial autocorrelation functions.\n\nThen a similar procedure is followed, but now considering the second conditional\n\nmoment of the process (the time series volatility), and in this case a range of models\n\ncan be selected to better adjust the data volatility, namely, FIGARCH, FIAPARCH\n\nand FIEGARCH models.\n\nTo identify the models and estimate its parameters we use the TSM software (David-\n\nson (2010)), as it allows for a very rich analysis on the long memory phenomenon.\n\nAfter identifying the model and estimating its parameters (through the conditional\n\nmaximum likelihood estimation method), we need to evaluate its adequacy by testing\n\nif its residuals can be considered as realisations of a white noise (WN) process. In\n\nother words, we want to test if the residuals are uncorrelated random variables with\n\nnull mean and constant variance.\n\n14\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nWe start by analysing the empirical autocorrelation functions of the residuals, and\n\nboth ACF and PACF must show no statistically signi?cant pattern. The hypothesis of\n\nuncorrelated residuals can also be checked by computing the Ljung-Box and the Box-\n\nPierce tests, which are both implemented in R, Team (2004). To evaluate whether\n\nthe variance is constant, we may simply analyse the residuals plot in order to examine\n\nif there is any change in the behaviour of the residuals in terms of their volatility.\n\nAnother way, is to apply the Box-Cox's power transformation (see (3.13)) for di?erent\n\nvalues of ?.\n\nThe Lagrange Multiplier test (de?ned in Eviews, Software (2009)) is also computed\n\nin order to check for the presence of conditional heteroskedasticity and for any evidence\n\nof ARCH e?ects, when we are analysing the residuals of the identi?ed model for the\n\nconditional mean.\n\nBased on the test results, we may have to adjust other models, so that all assump-\n\ntions are veri?ed.\n\n3. Forecasting and model selection\n\nAfter identifying and validating several models in the previous point we are now able\n\nto proceed with the forecasting by taking into account two types of prediction methods.\n\nThe ?rst one is an in-sample method which consists of one-step-ahead prediction and\n\nits main purpose is to test the model stability. The second approach, from our point\n\nof view much more interesting, consists on the prediction of k out-of-sample values.\n\nHaving the forecasts of the identi?ed models, the next step is to select the one that\n\nbetter adjusts reality, and there are several criteria, described in Section 3.3, that can\n\nhelp us to choose which is, in fact, the best model.\n\n3.2 Regime-switching Models\n\nIn this section we present the alternative approach used to model and forecast the Brent\n\nprices: regime-switching models. The idea is to analyse if the behaviour of the data\n\nset can be described by di?erent states, or regimes. Therefore in Subsection 3.2.1 we\n\npresent a brief introduction to regime-switching models by considering the two types of\n\nswitching mechanisms used in this study, the smooth transition autoregressive (STAR)\n\nmodels and the Markov-switching (MS) models.\n\nIn Subsection 3.2.2 we describe our methodology to understand and model the\n\nBrent prices behaviour considering these state-dependent models.\n\n15\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\n3.2.1 Introduction\n\nThe regime-switching models can be de?ned as non-linear models that allow for the\n\npossibility that the dynamic behaviour of the time series depends on regimes that\n\noccur at any given point in time. Therefore this class of models lets the series switch\n\nstochastically between alternative cases of the conditional mean and variance equations.\n\nIn other words, it allows for certain properties of the time series, such as mean, variance\n\nand/or autocorrelation to be di?erent across regimes.\n\nThe ?rst class of these models to be introduced is the STAR models. Initially,\n\nTong (1983) proposed the threshold autoregressive (TAR) model, which assumes that\n\nthe regime in a given point in time, t, can be determined by an observable variable.\n\nTherefore the regime is de?ned considering the value of the observable variable (also\n\nnamed as threshold variable) relative to a de?ne threshold value, which we refer to as\n\nc.\n\nA general class of state-dependent models is the STAR model, which assumes that\n\nthe transition between regimes is gradual. A two-regime STAR(p) model is given by\n\nyt = (?1,0 + ?1,1 yt?1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + ?1,p yt?p) (1 ? G(st; ?, c))\n\n+ (?2,0 + ?2,1 yt?1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + ?2,p yt?p) G(st; ?, c) + ?t, (3.20)\n\nwith t = 1, . . . , T . The st variable, as referred in Dijk et al. (2002), can assume several\n\nforms. As discussed by Ter\u00e4svirta (1994), st is considered to be a lagged endogenous\n\nvariable, st = yt?? (with ? de?ned as the delay parameter), while Frances and Dijk\n\n(2000) assume st to be an exogenous variable (st = zt). The other term is the transition\n\nfunction, G(st; ?, c), whose choice determines di?erent regime-switching behaviours.\n\nA popular choice for this function is the logistic function,\n\nG(st; ?, c) =\n1\n\n1 + exp(??(st ? c))\n, (3.21)\n\nwhere ? is the smoothness parameter, c is the threshold value, and the STAR model\n\nturns into a logistic STAR (LSTAR) model. When ? tends to zero the logistic function\n\napproaches a constant value (equal to 0.5), and when ? = 0 the LSTAR model reduces\n\nto a linear model. Another particular model occurs when ? becomes very large and\n\nst = yt??, transforming the transition function into an indicator function I[st > c]\n\nand leading the transition between di?erent regimes to be instantaneous. This class of\n\nmodels is called a self-exciting TAR (SETAR) model, and a two-regime SETAR(p) is\n\n16\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nrepresented as\n\nyt = (?0,1 + ?1,1 yt?1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + ?1,p yt?p) (1 ? I[st > c])\n\n+ (?2,0 + ?2,1 yt?1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + ?2,p yt?p) I[st > c] + ?t, (3.22)\n\nwhere I[A] = 1 if the event A occurs, and I[A] = 0 otherwise. For a more detailed\n\ndescription on these models we refer to Tong (1983), and Frances and Dijk (2000).\n\nIn some cases is interesting to allow for more than two regimes. Therefore a m-\n\nregime SETAR model can be obtained by assuming m+1 threshold values, c0, c1, . . . , cm?1, cm,\n\nsuch that ?? = c0 &lt;c1 &lt;\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 &lt;cm?1 &lt;cm = ?, and the extension of (3.22) to a\nm-regime of order p is given by\n\nyt = ?0,j + ?1,jyt?1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + ?p,jyt?p + ?t if cj?1 &lt;yt?1 ? cj, (3.23)\n\nfor j = 1, . . . , m states.\n\nA similar approach is done for the STAR model. Consider the same subset of\n\nthreshold values de?ned above, c1, . . . , cm?1, and an additional set of m?1 smoothness\nparameters, ?1, . . . , ?m?1, then a m-regime STAR model can be de?ned as\n\nyt = ?\n?\n1xt + (?2 ? ?1)\n\n?xtG1(st) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + (?m ? ?m?1)?xtGm?1(st) + ?t, (3.24)\n\nwhere xt = (1, x?\n?\nt)\n\n? with x?t = (yt?1, . . . , yt?p)\n?, ?i = (?i,0, . . . , ?i,p)\n\n? with i = 1, . . . , m,\n\nand Gj(st) ? Gj(st; ?j, cj) are the logistic functions de?ned in (3.21) for j = 1, . . . , m?\n1.\n\nThe other class of regime-switching models, contrary to the one previously de-\n\nscribed, assumes that the regime that occurs at time t cannot be determined by an\n\nobservable variable. In fact, the switching between regimes depends on an unobservable\n\nvariable, which we denote as st, and that characterises the regime or state in which the\n\nprocess is at a given time t.\n\nMany authors, namely Hamilton (1989) and Ter\u00e4svirta (1994) among others, have\n\nmade many relevant contributions among non-linear models, especially regime-switching\n\nmodels. In this analysis we focus on Markov-switching autoregressive (MS-AR) mod-\n\nels, considering a ?nite number of states. Additionally, MS-AR models can be seen as\n\nan extension of autoregressive models to the non-linear case. A common representation\n\n17\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\n(see, for example, Frances and Dijk (2000)) of a MS-AR(p) model is given by\n\nA(n) =\n\n??????\n?????\n\n?0,1 +\n?p\n\ni=1 ?i,1 yt?i + ?t, if st = 1\n\n?0,2 +\n?p\n\ni=1 ?i,2 yt?i + ?t, if st = 2\n...\n\n?0,m +\n?p\n\ni=1 ?i,m yt?i + ?t, if st = m,\n\n(3.25)\n\nor, in a shorthand version by\n\nyt = ?0,st +\n\np?\ni=1\n\n?i,st yt?i + ?t, st = j, (3.26)\n\nwhere the parameters ?0, and ?i, with i = 1, . . . , p are estimated for each state j, with\n\nj = 1, . . . , m regimes.\n\nHowever, as the switching is under the control of a Markov-chain updating mech-\n\nanism with ?xed transition probabilities, the model is only completely characterised\n\nafter de?ning these probabilities, which are given by\n\npij = P(st = j|st?1 = i), i, j = 1, . . . , m, (3.27)\n\nwith pij ? 0 and\n?m\n\nj=1 pij = 1 for all i, j = 1, . . . m. Once again we refer to Engle and\n\nHamilton (1990), Frances and Dijk (2000) and Hamilton (1994) for a more detailed\n\nanalysis.\n\n3.2.2 Modelling Methodology\n\nIn this section we present a brief description of the methodology we use in the modelling\n\nand forecasting of the Brent prices when considering regime-switching models.\n\nLike in the methodology regarding long memory time series models, previously\n\ndiscussed in Subsection 3.1.2, we also consider some key steps, much in line with the\n\nones proposed by Frances and Dijk (2000). Therefore we assume the following steps\n\n1. Model identi?cation and regime-switching testing;\n\n2. Model validation; and\n\n3. Forecasting and model selection.\n\nNext we present a brief discussion on each of the above topics.\n\n1. Model identi?cation and regime-switching testing\n\n18\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nWe start by discussing the model identi?cation for the STAR models as well as for\n\na restriction of this class, the SETAR models. The ?rst step consists on identifying\n\nan appropriate order p for the autoregressive model, and the technique used for this\n\nprocedure has already been explained in Subsection 3.1.2.\n\nWe also need to choose the number of regimes, m, and consequently the number of\n\nthe threshold values ci, for i = 1, . . . , m?1 states, as well as their estimates. The choice\nof the threshold values is generally dependent on the number of observations in each\n\nregime, so that each state contains a minimum number of observations to obtain reliable\n\nestimates of the autoregressive parameters. Therefore the threshold values are usually\n\nchosen so that each regime contains at least a speci?ed fraction of observations. There\n\nis no clear choice for this fraction but the R software assumes that 15% is reasonable.\n\nAnother important aspect is to select the threshold variable, and in this case for the\n\nSTAR model, we also consider the data itself, lagged by some positive integer ?. The\n\nestimate for the delay parameter, ?, is the value that minimises the residual variance.\n\nRegarding the STAR model, it is also necessary to estimate the smoothness param-\n\neter, ?. According to Frances and Dijk (2000) the estimate of ? is usually imprecise\n\nand, when its signi?cance is analysed, it is usually considered as statistically insignif-\n\nicant. For more details on the identi?cation of SETAR and STAR models we refer to\n\nAntonio (2008).\n\nOne important and relevant issue regarding regime-switching models, and in par-\n\nticular SETAR models, is to test if the time series really needs to be modelled by\n\nnon-linear processes. We follow closely the tests described by Hansen (1999) that, gen-\n\nerally, considers an appropriate least squares test of the null hypothesis of SETAR(i)\n\nagainst SETAR(k), with i &lt;k. The test statistic is given by\n\nFik = n\n\n(\nSi ? Sk\n\nSk\n\n)\n, (3.28)\n\nand is rejected for large values of Fik. The parameter Si is the residual sum of squares\n\n(RSS) of the SETAR(i) model, and Sk is the RSS of the SETAR(k) model. This ratio\n\nis equivalent to the likelihood ratio test when the errors are independent and follow\n\na N(0, ?2) process, and is also equivalent to the Lagrange multiplier test. So this\n\ntest can be used for testing linearity (SETAR(1)) against the SETAR(2) alternative\n\n(a non-linear model with two regimes). A large value of F12, as previously mentioned,\n\nleads to the rejection of the null hypothesis, but in order to implement this test we\n\nmust know the distribution of F12 under the null hypothesis. In most testing contexts,\n\ntest statistics like Fik, or in particular F12, are expected to have an asymptotic ?\n2\n\n19\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\ndistribution. However, this is not the case, and an asymptotic distribution theory must\n\nbe developed. In e?ect, if F12 is not statistically signi?cant when compared to the ?\n2, it\n\nwill be certainly not signi?cant when compared to the correct asymptotic distribution.\n\nFor a more detailed description on this procedure we refer to Hansen (1999). This test is\n\nimplemented in R software and allows testing for a linear autoregressive model against\n\na SETAR(2) and against a SETAR(3) models, and it also tests the null hypothesis of\n\nSETAR(2) against SETAR(3). For further discussion we refer to Antonio (2008) and\n\nHansen (1999).\n\nFor the Markov-switching models, we also start by specifying an appropriate order\n\np for the AR(p) model, and this procedure is described in Subsection 3.1.2. As for\n\nthis class of models, the regimes are determined by an unobservable variable (st), we\n\nneed to choose the number of states, or regimes, for the data under investigation. For\n\neach state the autoregressive parameters are estimated using the maximum likelihood\n\ntechniques and the transition probability from one regime to another is also determined.\n\nAdditionally, the probability that a process is in a particular state st at time t, given\n\nall information available at that time is also determined\n\np(st|y1, . . . , yt) (3.29)\n\nand is de?ned as the ?lter inference of the process to be at a certain regime in time t.\n\nWe also perform an inference about the historical state of the process at some date t,\n\nbut now based on all given observations,\n\np(st|y1, . . . , yT ) (3.30)\n\nand is referred to as the smoothness inference about the regime at time t.\n\nThe Markov-switching model relevance is tested by computing a Likelihood Ratio\n\n(LR) statistic, which assumes for H0 the hypothesis of linearity against the alternative\n\nof a relevant MS model. In this case, the test statistic is\n\nLRMS = LMS ? LAR (3.31)\n\nwhere LMS and LAR correspond, respectively, to the values of the likelihood functions\n\nof Markov-switching and linear autoregressive models. As described by Frances and\n\nDijk (2000) this test statistic cannot be characterised analytically, so critical values\n\nmust be computed in terms of computational simulation.\n\n20\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\n2. Model validation\n\nAfter identifying and estimating the model we proceed with the model validation by\n\nperforming several diagnostic tests. Although the residuals can be subjected to the di-\n\nagnostic tests proposed and described by Box and Jenkins (1976) (seeSubsection 3.1.2),\n\nsome test statistics are not suitable in the context of non-linear models.\n\nRegarding the SETAR and STAR models we follow closely the methodology pro-\n\nposed by Frances and Dijk (2000) and test mainly two aspects: serial correlation and\n\nremaining non-linearity.\n\nFor testing the serial correlation, we need to assume a general non-linear AR(p)\n\nmodel,\n\nyt = F(xt; ?) + ?t, (3.32)\n\nwhere xt = (1, yt?1, . . . , yt?p), and F(xt; ?) corresponds to a general non-linear function\n\nwith parameters ? and twice continuously di?erentiable. The Lagrange Multiplier (LM)\n\napproach is used and its test for the qth order serial dependence in ?t is checked by\n\ncomputing\n\nF = nR2 ? ?2(q) (3.33)\n\nwhere R2 is the coe?cient of determination of ??t on ?F(xt; ?)/?? and q lagged residuals,\n\n??t?1, . . . , ??t?q.\n\nWhen testing for remaining non-linearity in models such as STAR and SETAR\n\nmodels, a very simple analysis can be done. It is possible to test if the time series\n\nunder investigation requires another regime, and the techniques for this evaluation\n\nhave been previously described when performing the regime-switching testing. For\n\nexample, if a two-regime model has been identi?ed, we may test the null hypothesis of\n\na two-regime model against the alternative that a third regime is required, and so on.\n\nConsidering Markov-switching models, Hamilton (1996) proposes a wide diagnostic\n\nchecking analysis by testing for residuals autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity, misspec-\n\ni?cation of the Markov-process st, and omitted explanatory variables. The used tests\n\nare LM-type tests and make heavy use of the score ht(?) which is de?ned as\n\nht(?) ?\n? ln f(yt|?t?1; ?)\n\n??\n(3.34)\n\nwhere f(yt|?t?1; ?) corresponds to the likelihood, or to the conditional density function.\nFor a detailed description on these tests we refer to Frances and Dijk (2000) and\n\n21\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nHamilton (1996).\n\n3. Forecasting and model selection\n\nAt last, after identifying and testing several models, we are able to proceed with the\n\nforecasting. Analogous to what has been done for the long memory time series models,\n\ndiscussed in Subsection 3.1.2, we consider two di?erent approaches: the in-sample\n\none-step-ahead and the out-of-sample forecasting.\n\nThen the achieved results, obtained for each model, are evaluated considering the\n\nmethods introduced and discussed in Section 3.3, and the best model is, ?nally, chosen.\n\n3.3 Model Selection\n\nAnalogous to the previous sections, we also consider two subsections. In the ?rst, Sub-\n\nsection 3.3.1, we introduce some concepts and techniques used for the model selection.\n\nWe refer to simple methods that allow for the evaluation of in-sample and out-of-sample\n\nforecasts but we also discuss some formal tests that evaluate the prediction accuracy\n\nof two competing forecasts.\n\nIn Subsection 3.3.2 we present the key steps followed in the model selection.\n\n3.3.1 Introduction\n\nThere are two di?erent approaches that help us to select the best model. The ?rst is\n\nbased on an in-sample ?t evaluation, and the second considers an out-of-sample per-\n\nforming analysis. Regarding the in-sample approach the most appropriate method is\n\nbased on the information criteria, namely the Akaike's information criterion (AIC),\n\nthe Bayesian information criterion (BIC), or the Schwartz information criterion (SIC).\n\nThese model selection criteria are goodness-of-?t measures which compare the in-\n\nsample ?t, by measuring the residual variance, against the number of estimated pa-\n\nrameters.\n\nThe other approach is to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the proposed models\n\nby considering out-of-sample forecasting. Once again, there are several procedures to\n\ncheck on the quality of the forecasts. The most simple one can be obtained by simply\n\ncalculating the percentage of the m observations which are within the 95 percent con-\n\n?dence interval (CI). Others commonly used are the root mean square error (RMSE),\n\nand the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) that gives a relative error measure.\n\nThese last two statistics compare prediction errors from di?erent models. However a\n\nvery important issue is being neglected, i.e., testing if there is any qualitative di?erence\n\n22\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nbetween the forecasts of the evaluated models. The original tests of forecasting accuracy\n\nimposed certain conditions to the loss function and to the forecast errors that are very\n\ndi?cult to achieve. The loss function has to be quadratic and the forecast errors have\n\nto be Gaussian, with null mean, and serially and contemporaneously uncorrelated. To\n\novercome these restrictive limitations, Diebold and Mariano (1995) proposed several\n\ntests which test the null hypothesis of no di?erence in the accuracy of two competing\n\nforecasts, but allow a certain ?exibility in the loss function, as well as in the forecast\n\nerrors.\n\nThat is, assume two forecasts {y?it}Tt=1 and {y?jt}Tt=1 of the time series {yt}Tt=1 and\ntheir respective forecast errors, {eit}Tt=1 and {ejt}Tt=1 with T being the number of pre-\ndicted values. The idea is to assess the expected loss function (de?ned as g(.)) associ-\n\nated to each of the forecasts. As in many applications the loss function is assumed to\n\nbe a direct function of the forecast errors, what we want to test for the null hypothesis\n\nis if E[g(eit)] = E[g(ejt)], or simply E[dt] = 0 with dt = g(eit) ? g(ejt). In other words,\nwe want to test the null hypothesis that the population mean of the loss di?erential\n\nseries is zero.\n\nIn order to test the null hypothesis of a zero mean of the loss di?erential, Diebold\n\nand Mariano (1995) assume {dt}Tt=1 as the sample path of a loss di?erential series. The\nasymptotic distribution of the sample mean loss di?erential can be de?ned as\n\n?\nT(d? ? \u00b5) ? N(0, 2?fd(0)) (3.35)\n\nwhere d? = 1\nT\n\n?T\nt=1 dt , and fd(0) is the spectral density of the loss di?erential at\n\nfrequency zero. Thus, considering large samples, d? is approximately distributed as\n\nN(\u00b5, 2?fd(0)), and for testing the null hypothesis of equal forecast accuracy the test\n\nstatistic is given by\n\nDM =\nd??\n\n2?f?d(0)\nT\n\n? N(0, 1) (3.36)\n\nwhere f?d(0) is a consistent estimator of fd(0). For more details on this test we refer to\n\nDiebold and Mariano (1995).\n\n3.3.2 Model Selection Methodology\n\nIn this subsection we present the methodology we use for selecting the model that\n\nbetter describes the behaviour of the Brent prices.\n\nAs previously mentioned, there are two di?erent approaches to verify the adequacy\n\n23\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nof the model in terms of forecasting. For the in-sample approach, we compute the\n\ninformation criteria, such as AIC, BIC, and SIC.\n\nFor the out-of-sample approach, we consider not only forecast accuracy measures,\n\nbut we also compare the forecast accuracy of two di?erent models. In order to assess\n\nthe prediction accuracy we compute the usual accuracy measures, namely the root\n\nmean square error (RMSE),\n\nRMSE =\n\n???? 1\nT\n\nT?\nt=1\n\n(pt ? p?t)2, (3.37)\n\nand the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE),\n\nMAPE =\n1\n\nT\n\nT?\nt=1\n\n|pt ? p?t|\npt\n\n\u00d7 100%, (3.38)\n\nwhere T is the number of the predicted observations, and pt and p?t are the actual and\n\nthe forecasted price, respectively.\n\nFinally, the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test is also computed to compare the forecast\n\naccuracy of the di?erent identi?ed models.\n\n24\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nEmpirical Results\n\nIn this chapter we present all empirical results. In Section 4.1 we start by introducing\n\nthe Brent prices data set. We analyse its empirical distribution by performing a graph-\n\nical analysis, and by computing some descriptive statistics, in order to evaluate some\n\nlocation and dispersion measures, as well as its symmetry and kurtosis. The presence\n\nof outliers is also tested.\n\nNext we proceed with the data modelling. In Section 4.2 we analyse and forecast\n\nthe Brent prices using long memory time series models. During the model identi?cation\n\nprocess, we evaluate the long memory phenomena not only in the conditional mean\n\nbut also in the conditional variance, and we model the data with ARFIMA-FIGARCH\n\nmodels, and some of their variants. In Section 4.3 we characterise and predict the\n\nBrent prices behaviour considering regime-switching models, and in this methodology\n\nwe consider two di?erent approaches. The ?rst considers that the changes in regime\n\noccur due to an observable and known variable, and the data is modelled with STAR\n\nand SETAR models. The other, assuming that the switching between regimes results\n\nfrom an unobservable variable, considers the application of MS-AR models.\n\nFinally, in Section 4.4 we analyse the forecasting values of the previous identi?ed\n\nmodels, and by performing a prediction accuracy assessment we select the model that\n\nbetter describes and adjusts our Brent prices behaviour. We start with a in-sample ?t\n\nevaluation by comparing the information criteria of the di?erent identi?ed models, as\n\nwell as some forecast accuracy measures, namely the RMSE and the MAPE. Then we\n\nproceed with an out-of-sample prediction accuracy evaluation, and besides the RMSE\n\nand MAPE measures, the Diebold-Mariano test is also computed in order to compare\n\nthe forecast accuracy of the di?erent models.\n\nWe refer that in all sections the study is divided according to the data granularity,\n\nmeaning that there is a subsection for the daily analysis and another for the monthly\n\nBrent prices study.\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\n4.1 Data Analysis\n\nIn this section we introduce our time series: the Brent prices data set. First we evaluate\n\nits behaviour by presenting its chronogram and by performing a descriptive analysis.\n\nThe data consists of the Bloomberg European Dated Forties Oseberg Ero?sk Price and\n\nwas obtained through a Bloomberg1 terminal.\n\nAs our main purpose is to analyse and understand the Brent prices behaviour, we\n\nhave used both daily and monthly prices data sets. For the daily data set we consider\n\nhistorical data (on a daily basis and only trading days) from the fourth of January\n\n2000 until the 31st of December 2009, for a total of n = 2560 observations. The\n\nmonthly data, considering the same historical period, is achieved by computing the\n\nmonthly average of the daily prices, for a total of n = 120 observations. However,\n\nin the modelling and for estimation purposes, we consider historical data only until\n\nSeptember 2009 (for a total of 117 observations) in order to keep an out-of-sample of\n\na year period. Next we present an introduction to each data set. In Subsection 4.1.1\n\nwe present the daily Brent prices while in Subsection 4.1.2 we give an overview of the\n\nmonthly data behaviour.\n\n4.1.1 Daily Brent Prices\n\nFirst, we start by introducing the daily Brent prices (in USD/Barrel, or $/bbl) by\n\nshowing its behaviour in Figure 4.1. From its graphical analysis it is possible to identify\n\nFigure 4.1: Daily Brent prices chronogram (in USD/barrel), from January 4, 2000,\nuntil December 31, 2009 (2560 observations).\n\nan increasing trend from January 2000 to July 2006, that leads the Brent prices to reach\n\nthe value of 76.29$/bbl. Then a slightly decrease can be observed until January 2007,\n\npreceding the most expressive raise that lasts for one year and an half, and that guides\n\n1Service that provides ?nancial news and data to some companies and organisations.\n\n26\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nthe Brent prices to touch its maximum value of 145$/bbl on the third of July 2008.\n\nAfterwards, its price falls again to 34.04$/bbl at the 24th December 2008, and latter\n\nit inverts its trend, starting an increase that remains until the end of December 2009.\n\nTo complement the graphical analysis, some descriptive statistics are also provided\n\nin Table 4.1. Based on the ratio between the standard deviation and the mean, we\n\nevaluated the coe?cient of variation which is, approximately, 52%, meaning that the\n\nprice variation represents about 52% of the mean. Regarding the measures of loca-\n\ntion, we can verify that the series has a wide range of variation from a minimum of\n\n16.62$/bbl to a maximum of 145.66$/bbl, and that 5% of the observations are higher\n\nthan 101.61$/bbl. The asymmetry measure (skewness) of 1.10 suggests that the mass\n\nof the distribution is concentrated on the left side of the curve, but there are a set of\n\nhigh values that lead to a long right tail. Finally, we have analysed the kurtosis mea-\n\nsure which represents the ?peakedness? of the distribution. It is a leptokurtic function,\n\nas its value is 3.94, indicating that the probability of occurring extreme variations is\n\nhigher than in a normal distribution (kurtosis is 3).\n\nBrent prices\nMean 49.83\n\nStd.

Regarding this point,\n\nour main goal is simply to identify if there are any severe outliers. The methodology\n\nused is based on the interquartile range and assume that an observation is considered\n\noutlier if it lays outside the interval [Q1 ? k(Q3 ? Q1), Q3 + k(Q3 ? Q1)], for some\nconstant k. Assuming k = 3, and since our series has Q1 = 28 and Q3 = 66.23, we\n\nchecked all observations and concluded that there is no severe outliers. The presence\n\nof outliers is also checked by computing the Grubbs' test described in Komsta (2005),\n\nand implemented in the R software, Team (2004). Its null hypothesis assumes that\n\nthere is no outlier in the data set against an alternative hypothesis that there is at\n\nleast one observation statistically di?erent from all the others. This test consists of\n\ncalculating the test statistic G and comparing it to an appropriate critical value, where\n\n27\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nG =\nmaxi=1,...,N |Yi?Y? |\n\ns\n, with Y? and s denoting the mean and the standard deviation,\n\nrespectively, and N being the number of observations. Although this test is based on\n\nthe assumption of normality, and the performed normality tests (see Table A.1) rejected\n\nthis hypothesis we decided to compute it anyway. The observation in evaluation is the\n\nmaximum value of the series, 145.66$/bbl, and as the p-value of the Grubbs' test is\n\n0.30, we do no reject the null hypothesis, and, consequently, the highest value is not\n\nconsidered an outlier, corroborating with the previous result.\n\n4.1.2 Monthly Brent Prices\n\nThe behaviour of the monthly Brent prices data set is presented in Figure 4.2. The\n\nFigure 4.2: Monthly Brent prices chronogram (in USD/barrel), from January 2000\nuntil December 2009 (120 observations).\n\nconclusions from the graphical analysis are, as expected, very similar to the ones ob-\n\ntained for the daily data. We stress that the monthly prices are obtained by computing\n\nthe monthly average of the daily prices. Therefore, an increasing trend is also exhibited\n\nfrom January 2000 to July 2006 followed by a decline for six months. The Brent prices\n\ntouch its maximum of 134 $/bbl in July 2008, then decreases, and after December 2008\n\nit increases again till the end of the 2009 year.\n\nAnalogous to the analysis implemented for the daily data, we also computed some\n\ndescriptive statistics. The results, presented in Table 4.2, are practically the same as\n\nthe ones from the daily data set. The coe?cient of variation is still 52%, the leptokurtic\n\ncharacteristic remains, and the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the left side\n\nof the curve exhibiting a long right tail.\n\nRegarding the presence of outliers, we have applied the methodology based on the\n\ninterquartile range, and assuming k = 3 no severe outliers were identi?ed. The Grubb's\n\ntest was also computed, though the hypothesis of normality had been rejected (see\n\n28\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nBrent prices\nMean 49.86\n\nStd.

We start by analysing the daily data in Subsection 4.2.1 and in\n\nSubsection 4.2.2 we characterise the monthly data set.\n\n4.2.1 Daily Brent Prices\n\nFollowing closely the methodology described in Subsection 3.1.2 we start with the\n\nanalysis of the daily Brent prices data set.\n\n1. Stationarity and long memory testing\n\nAs previously referred, before testing the long memory presence in our data set,\n\nwe need to check if the time series has a stationary behaviour. We started to test the\n\nvariance stationarity by computing the Box-Cox's power transformation. Instead of\n\nchoosing a grid of values for the ?, we decided only to test the logarithmic hypothesis\n\n(as it is the most commonly used in ?nancial markets) against the data set with no\n\ntransformation. So, for the transformation parameter ? ? {0, 1}, the minimum of the\nsample variance of the transformed series is obtained for ? = 0 (the results are shown\n\n29\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nin Table A.3).\n\nAfter applying the logarithm to our data set in order to stabilise the variance, we\n\ntested if the series has a mean non-stationary behaviour. We computed some tests,\n\nsuch as KPSS, ADF and PP tests, and all results suggest that, for a signi?cance level\n\nof ? = 5%, the logarithmic transformation is not enough to stabilise the mean of the\n\nseries. Additionally, we need to apply to it the ?rst order di?erences. The results,\n\npresented in Table A.4, show that after di?erentiating the data set the time series is\n\n?nally stationary.\n\nWe stress that the presence of any seasonal or cyclic component was also tested\n\nby examining the periodogram of the data set and by computing the Fisher test, see\n\nFisher (1929), and no signi?cant component has been identi?ed.\n\nAt this moment, we are able to check for the presence of short or long memory on the\n\nmean and volatility of our data set. We remark that we have assumed the Brent prices\n\nsquared returns as a proxy for the Brent prices volatility. An alternative approach\n\nmight have been the use of the realised volatility, however we leave this analysis for\n\nfurther investigation. In Table 4.3 we present the results obtained when estimating\n\nthe R/S, GPH and Robinson's d statistics. Although each gives a di?erent estimate\n\nvalue for the long memory parameter, the estimates of the Robinson's d and the GPH\n\n(considering a bandwidth of 0.7) tests are very similar for the Brent prices squared\n\nreturns. However, a very important step is to evaluate if the estimates are statistically\n\nsigni?cant. Since the GPH test provides not only the estimate but also its standard\n\ndeviation (contrary to the Robinson's d), we computed the t-test and concluded that,\n\nfor a signi?cance level of ? = 5%, the d estimate for the mean is not statistically\n\nsigni?cant, while for the volatility it is, and for the further analysis we have considered\n\nthe value of 0.3152 for the long memory parameter in the volatility of the data set.\n\nBrent prices Brent prices\nreturns squared returns\n\nR/S statistic 0.0376 0.1186\nBw=0.6 0.0281 0.4922\n\nGPH Bw=0.7 0.0053 0.3152\nBw=0.8 0.0343 0.1741\n\nRobinson's d 0.0920 0.3159\n\nTable 4.3: Estimates of the long memory parameter, d, for the daily Brent prices.\n\n2. Model identi?cation and validation\n\nAfter estimating the long memory parameters for the mean and volatility of our\n\ndata set, we began the model identi?cation. First, and as there is no evidence of\n\n30\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nlong memory in the conditional mean, we computed the empirical autocorrelation and\n\npartial autocorrelation functions of our stationary time series, and represented them\n\nin Figure 4.3.\n\n(a)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\n0.\n0\n\n0.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n0.\n8\n\n1.\n0\n\nLag\n\nAC\nF\n\ndlog.brent\n\n(b)\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\n?0\n.0\n\n6\n?0\n\n.0\n4\n\n?0\n.0\n\n2\n0.\n\n00\n0.\n\n02\n0.\n\n04\n\nLag\n\nPa\nrti\n\nal\n A\n\nCF\n\nSeries  dlog.brent\n\nFigure 4.3: Empirical ACF (a) and empirical PACF (b) of daily Brent prices returns.\n\nFrom the analysis of both functions we conclude that there is no ARMA structure\n\non the mean of the series, so we modelled it with as a WN process with null mean. How-\n\never, when evaluating the adequacy of the residuals, we concluded that although the\n\nresiduals are uncorrelated as the Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests have con?rmed, there\n\nis structure in the squared residuals (see Figure A.1). The hypothesis of homokedastic\n\nerrors was also rejected when we computed the ARCH test. The results of the residuals\n\nanalysis are shown in Table A.5.\n\nTherefore, as the residuals of the model have a non constant conditional variance\n\nand exhibit long memory, we have considered the FIGARCH and some of its variants,\n\nnamely FIAPARCH and FIEGARCH models, due to the asymmetry of the volatil-\n\nity. We have also modelled the data set without the long memory characteristic for\n\ncomparison purposes. We remark that in the model estimation we have considered\n\nthe conditional maximum likelihood estimation method, and as the series of returns\n\nrejects the hypothesis of normality we have also assumed a Student's t distribution\n\n(see Table A.1). We refer that the estimation of these models, especially the ones\n\nconsidering the long memory characteristic is complex, and sometimes the algorithm\n\nfailed to converge.\n\nSeveral models were tested and we present the results of the best model, in terms\n\nof the residual analysis, within each class of models. The information regarding the\n\nproposed models is presented in Table A.6, and the diagnostic checking for each model\n\nis summarised and shown in Table 4.4.\n\nThe BP and LB tests correspond to the Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests, respec-\n\ntively.

In e?ect, all models\n\npassed the diagnostic checking, except the FIEGARCH(2,2) model that was not able\n\nto remove the autocorrelation among the squared residuals for the lower lags. An\n\nadditional examination regarding the models validation is shown from Figure A.2 to\n\nFigure A.7. Next we followed to the forecasting and model selection, and we considered\n\nall identi?ed models except the FIEGARCH(2,2) model.\n\n3. Forecasting and model selection\n\nAs we have several identi?ed and validated models, we followed with the mod-\n\nels forecasting. Although we have computed the predicted values, we decided only\n\nto present the results in Subsection 4.4.1, where a prediction accuracy assessment is\n\nperformed by comparing the results of all identi?ed daily models.\n\n4.2.2 Monthly Brent Prices\n\nAnalogous to the procedure followed for the daily data set, in the modelling of the\n\nmonthly Brent prices we also consider the modelling methodology described in Sub-\n\nsection 3.1.2. We start by evaluating the stationary behaviour and the long memory\n\nin our data set.\n\n1. Stationarity and long memory testing\n\nThe ?rst step to follow is to verify the variance homogeneity, and we considered the\n\nsame two values for the transformation parameter, ? ? {0, 1}. The results, presented\nin Table A.7, are very similar to the ones obtained for the daily data set, as they also\n\nsuggest a logarithmic transformation.\n\n32\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nAnalogous to the daily results, and since no periodic or seasonal component were\n\nidenti?ed, we have computed the KPSS, PP and ADF tests to check for the series sta-\n\ntionarity and concluded that we needed to apply to the series the ?rst order di?erences,\n\nsee Table A.8.\n\nAs our data set is now stationary, we are able to proceed with the short and long\n\nmemory testing. The R/S, GPH and Robinson's d statistics were computed and the\n\nestimates of the d parameter are given in Table 4.5. In this case, the results are quite\n\nBrent prices Brent prices\nreturns squared returns\n\nR/S statistic 0.0736 -0.2528\nBw=0.6 -0.0610 0.1208\n\nGPH Bw=0.7 0.1037 0.2044\nBw=0.8 0.1221 0.4249\n\nRobinson's d 0.1605 0.0689\n\nTable 4.5: Estimates of the long memory parameter, d, for the monthly Brent prices.\n\ndi?erent from the ones obtained for the daily data, as we are not able to identify\n\nsimilar values for two di?erent statistics, which makes it harder to choose the right\n\nestimate. Additionally, the analysis of the di?erent d estimates for the mean and\n\nvolatility show simultaneously negative and positive values depending on the performed\n\nstatistic, which may lead to contradictory conclusions.\n\nThe estimate signi?cance was also tested, and for the conditional mean none of the\n\nestimates was statistically signi?cant. Regarding the conditional variance, both results\n\nfor the 0.7 and 0.8 bandwidths (in the GPH test) revealed to be statistically signi?cant,\n\nbut as they are quite di?erent and there is no obvious reason to choose one against the\n\nother, the choice of the d parameter will be done during the model identi?cation.\n\n2. Model identi?cation and validation\n\nWe are now able to proceed to the model identi?cation. As there is no evidence of\n\nlong memory in the conditional mean, we computed the empirical ACF and PACF of\n\nthe stationary series in Figure 4.4, in order to identify the order of the autoregressive\n\nand moving average parameters. From the analysis of both empirical autocorrelation\n\nfunctions, we verify that both exhibit a higher value for the sixth lag, so we adjusted\n\nan AR(6) to our stationary time series. We stress that, in the monthly modelling we\n\nhave considered historical data only until the end of September 2009, for a total of 117\n\nobservations, in order to keep an out-of-sample of twelve points, meaning that a year\n\nwill be forecasted.\n\nThe identi?ed model, an AR(6), passed all diagnostic tests. The ACF and PACF of\n\nits residuals were computed and shown in Figure A.8, and they illustrate the behaviour\n\n33\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\n(a)\n\n0 5 10 15 20\n\n?0\n.2\n\n0.\n0\n\n0.\n2\n\n0.\n4\n\n0.\n6\n\n0.\n8\n\n1.\n0\n\nLag\n\nAC\nF\n\ndlog_brent\n\n(b)\n\n5 10 15 20\n\n?0\n.2\n\n?0\n.1\n\n0.\n0\n\n0.\n1\n\nLag\n\nPa\nrti\n\nal\n A\n\nCF\n\nSeries  dlog_brent\n\nFigure 4.4: Empirical ACF (a) and empirical PACF (b) of the monthly Brent prices\nreturns.\n\nof a WN process. This behaviour is also con?rmed by the results of some diagnostic\n\ntests, namely the Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests and the ARCH LM test, that suggest\n\nno correlation among the residuals and no conditional heteroskedasticity, respectively\n\n(see Table A.9). Although the results suggest no ARCH e?ect, we tried to force a\n\nconditional heteroskedastic model to the volatility in order to include the long memory\n\ncharacteristic (using the previous estimates, as well as allowing the model to estimate\n\nitself the d parameter). However, and as expected, none of the tried models was\n\nstatistically signi?cant, meaning that the monthly Brent prices data set has no long-\n\nrange dependence, neither in the conditional mean, nor in the variance. So, the only\n\nproposed model for the monthly Brent prices returns is the AR(6) model (described in\n\nTable A.10), and its results are summarised in Table 4.6\n\nModel validation\nParam.

Forecasting and model selection\n\nNow, given the identi?ed model we proceeded with the models forecasting. Al-\n\nthough we have computed the predicted values, we decided, like in the daily case, only\n\nto present the results in Subsection 4.4.2, where a prediction accuracy assessment of\n\nall identi?ed monthly models is done.\n\n34\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\n4.3 Regime-switching Models\n\nIn this section we present the Brent prices modelling by considering the regime-switching\n\nmodels. Similar to the previous sections, we have also divided the analysis and mod-\n\nelling of the Brent prices in two di?erent subsections, according to the data granularity.\n\nThus, in Subsection 4.3.1 we perform the daily analysis, and in Subsection 4.3.2 we\n\ncharacterise the Brent prices behaviour considering monthly data.\n\n4.3.1 Daily Brent Prices\n\nConsidering the steps previously described in Subsection 3.2.2, we started with the\n\nmodel identi?cation.\n\n1. Model identi?cation and regime-switching testing\n\nAs previously referred, ?rst we need to identify an appropriate order for the autore-\n\ngressive parameter. So we started by running several autoregressive models, and the\n\nchoice of the p parameter corresponds to the model for which the information criterion\n\nAIC is minimum, and in this case we identi?ed an AR(1) model. Before we passed on\n\nto the other parameters estimation, we have con?rmed that modelling the data with\n\nan AR(1) model was enough to remove all data autocorrelation.\n\nAs the threshold variable is assumed to be the data itself, as previously mentioned,\n\nwe followed with the estimation of the delay parameter, ?. We considered a grid of\n\nvalues for this parameter, ? ? {1, 2, . . . , 9}, and the ?rst models we tried to adjust\nto the daily Brent prices were the LSTAR models, but as the estimated values for\n\nthe smoothness parameter were too high (see Table A.11) we decided to discard these\n\nmodels. We stress that for high values of the smoothness parameter (?), the transition\n\nbetween regimes is practically instantaneous, and as our threshold variable is the data\n\nitself, these models are in e?ect SETAR models. Therefore, we continued this analysis\n\nconsidering only this last class of models.\n\nOnce again, we assumed the same grid of values for the delay parameter and esti-\n\nmated the corresponding SETAR(1) models. The results are shown in Table 4.7, and\n\nthe minimum residual variance is achieved for ? = 7 and ? = 8. We decided to consider\n\n? = 7.\n\nWe proceeded with the regime-switching testing, and the results illustrated in Ta-\n\nble A.12 show that the hypothesis of linearity is not rejected, meaning that there is no\n\nneed to model the daily data with regime-switching models. Even though the achieved\n\nconclusion for the SETAR models, we have continued the analysis and tried to adjust\n\na MS-AR(1) model to the daily Brent prices.

The results were very interesting, though not surprising, as they cor-\n\nroborate with the SETAR model conclusions: the identi?ed model has also rejected the\n\nneed for modelling the daily data with regime-switching models. Instead of computing\n\nthe LR test, we checked if the estimated values for the parameters of the second regime\n\nwere statistically di?erent from the ones of the regime one. However, since the results\n\nshowed that they were not statistically di?erent, we could not reject the hypothesis of\n\nlinearity.\n\nGiven the previous results, we conclude that there is no improvement in modelling\n\nthe daily Brent prices with regime-switching models, as both regimes are statistically\n\nidentical, and consequently the data should be modelled with linear models.\n\n4.3.2 Monthly Brent Prices\n\nAnalogous to the procedure followed for the daily data, we started with the model\n\nidenti?cation and the regime-switching testing.\n\n1. Model identi?cation and regime-switching testing\n\nWe started by computing several models to identify the order of the AR(p) model,\n\nand the model that presented the lowest AIC was an AR(2) model. After con?rming\n\nthat the correlation among the residuals has been removed, we continued with the\n\nother parameters estimation.\n\nSince we are considering as threshold variable the data itself, we only need to\n\nestimate the delay parameter ?. First, we tried to apply LSTAR models, but as the\n\nachieved values for the smoothness parameter ? were too high (see Table A.13), and\n\nconsequently the regime transition was practically instantaneous, we decided to use\n\n36\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nonly SETAR models. The results for the SETAR models are shown in Table 4.8.\n\nFor each model, we have assumed an AR(2) model and for the following grid of delay\n\nResidual Threshold % Low % Medium % High\n? variance value(s) regime (observations)\n1 20.79 71.32 84% - 16%\n\n2 2 18.75 71.32 85% - 15%\nRegimes 3 18.02 70.19 82% - 18%\n\n4 18.44 70.80 84% - 16%\n1 22.63 43.03 58.48 49% 19% 32%\n\n3 2 17.49 33.36 71.32 44% 41% 15%\nRegimes 3 16.69 48.67 70.19 58% 25% 17%\n\n4 16.92 43.03 70.80 51% 33% 16%\n\nTable 4.8: Summary results of the SETAR models for the monthly Brent prices.\n\nvalues, ? ? {1, 2, 3, 4}, we computed the residual variance, the threshold value or values\n(depending if we are considering a two or a three-regime model), and the percentage of\n\nobservations in each regime. As the residual variance is minimum for ? = 3, we have\n\nconsidered a three month delay in the SETAR modelling.\n\nNext, in Table A.14 we present all tests regarding the number of regimes in the\n\nSETAR models. We started by testing the hypothesis of linearity against the alter-\n\nnatives SETAR(2) or SETAR(3), and the null hypothesis is clearly rejected meaning\n\nthat the monthly data should be modelled with regime-switching models. The hypoth-\n\nesis of a two-regime model (SETAR(2)) against a three-regime model (SETAR(3)) was\n\nalso tested, and in this case we do not reject the null hypothesis, and consequently, a\n\ntwo-regime model must be considered.\n\nWe embarked on the modelling of the MS-AR model. We started to consider an\n\nAR(2) model for each regime, and then using the TSM software, we adjusted a MS-\n\nAR(2) model to the monthly Brent prices. In the model estimation, we have considered\n\nthe conditional maximum likelihood estimation method and a Student's t distribution,\n\nas the monthly data rejects the normality hypothesis (see Table A.2). Thus, for each\n\nstate the TSM program estimated the parameters and the transition probability was\n\nalso calculated.\n\nRegarding the Markov-switching testing, and in order to test the hypothesis of\n\nlinearity against a two-regime model, we considered the same procedure used for the\n\ndaily data. Instead of computing the LR statistic, we computed the test that allowed\n\nto verify if the parameters of higher order regimes were di?erent from the linear (one-\n\nregime) model, and as they revealed to be statistically di?erent, we concluded that the\n\ndata should be modelled with a two-regime model. The hypothesis of another state was\n\nalso tried, however, due to estimation problems as the algorithm failed to converge, we\n\n37\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nwere not able to estimate a three-regime model. Therefore, we assume that our ?nal\n\nmodel is a two-regime MS-AR(2) model, in line with the two-regime SETAR(2) model\n\npreviously identi?ed.\n\nSo, to summarise we identi?ed two di?erent models: one assuming that the monthly\n\nBrent prices data set depends on itself with a three month lag, and the other considering\n\nthat it depends on an external and unknown variable. Both models, described in\n\nTable A.16 follow an AR(2) process and are a two-regime models.\n\n2. Model validation\n\nWe proceeded with the model validation by testing the serial correlation, and if\n\nthere is any remaining non-linearity.\n\nFirst we analysed the serial correlation of the two-regime SETAR(2) model. How-\n\never, as pointed by Frances and Dijk (2000), the SETAR models do not satisfy the\n\nrequirement of the linear function F(xt; ?) being twice continuously di?erentiable, and\n\nthe LM statistic cannot be applied to the residuals from SETAR models. As a solution,\n\nwe considered testing the correlation among the residuals in each regime by computing\n\nthe Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests, and the results suggest no correlation. The test\n\nfor remaining non-linearity has already been done. In the previous point, when we were\n\nestimating the number of regimes, we tested the null hypothesis of a two-regime model\n\nagainst the alternative that a third regime is required. In e?ect, we were testing if with\n\na two regime model there was any remaining non-linearity, and as the null hypothesis\n\nis not rejected we can conclude that there is no remaining non-linearity.\n\nThe model validation for the MS-AR(2) model is similar to the one followed by the\n\nSETAR models. The Box-Pierce and Ljung-Box tests were computed and their results\n\nindicate that there is no serial correlation when testing the MS-AR(2) model residuals.\n\nThe analysis of remaining non-linearity, as previously mentioned, could not be done\n\ndue to estimation problems. We refer to the di?culty in estimating non-linear models,\n\nas their estimating process involves complex mathematical calculations and requires\n\nadvanced mathematical techniques. Nonetheless we assumed the MS-AR(2) model as\n\nour ?nal model.\n\nWe stress that all results regarding the model validation for both models are shown\n\nin Table A.15.\n\nAt last, and after having the two proposed models validated we present their char-\n\nacteristics in Table A.16. Additionally, we have computed some statistics in order to\n\ncompare the results of both modelling approaches. The comparison, illustrated in Ta-\n\nble 4.9, is quite interesting as it indicates a great similarity between the results of the\n\n38\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\ntwo models. Both models show a clear di?erence between the two identi?ed regimes.\n\nWhile the ?rst regime, represented by the majority of observations, presents the lowest\n\nBrent prices and the highest variation, the other regime has the opposite character-\n\nistics, i.e., it exhibits the highest Brent prices and the lowest variation. Regarding\n\neach state duration, regime one lasts for more than one year (almost two years in the\n\nSETAR(2) model case), and the second state has a duration of only a few months.\n\nSETAR(2) model MS-AR(2) model\nRegime 1 Regime 2 Regime 1 Regime 2\n\nMean [$/bbl] 41.55 87.56 47.26 60.61\nStd.

The\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 4.5: Regime of the SETAR(2) model (a) and smoothed transition probability\nof the MS-AR(2) model (b) for the monthly Brent prices.\n\nSETAR(2) model seems to capture quite well the highest peaks of the monthly Brent\n\nprices, identifying them as part of the second regime and maintaining the remaining\n\nobservations in regime one. The smoothed probabilities estimated by the MS-AR(2)\n\nmodel are also able to identify the Brent prices peaks, however with a lag di?erence. For\n\nexample, when analysing the maximum of the Brent prices we verify that the smoothed\n\nprobability reaches the value one only after the maximum occurs. The results of these\n\ntwo models in terms of ?tting are compared in the next section.\n\n3. Forecasting and model selection\n\n39\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nAnalogous to the procedure followed for all previous models, the assessment of the\n\nprediction accuracy of the proposed regime-switching models is presented in Subsec-\n\ntion 4.4.2.\n\n4.4 Model Selection\n\nIn this section we select the ?nal models for the daily and monthly Brent prices.\n\nWe start by performing an in-sample analysis, comparing the information criteria of\n\nthe di?erent models, and some forecast accuracy measures, namely the RMSE and\n\nthe MAPE. Then we follow with an out-of-sample prediction accuracy evaluation by\n\ncomputing the RMSE and MAPE measures, and by performing the Diebold-Mariano\n\ntest in order to compare the forecast accuracy of the di?erent models. In terms of\n\norganisation, the daily results are presented in Subsection 4.4.1, and in Subsection 4.4.2\n\nwe select the ?nal model for the monthly Brent prices.\n\n4.4.1 Daily Brent Prices\n\nConsidering the methodology previously described, we start by presenting some results\n\nregarding the in-sample analysis. We recall that we have only analysed the time se-\n\nries models, as we were not able to identify any regime-switching model for the daily\n\nBrent prices. Therefore, in Table 4.10, we compare the results of the proposed models\n\nfor the daily Brent prices, presenting the information criteria, and some measures of\n\nprediction accuracy. From the information criteria analysis, we verify that the intro-\n\nInf. criteria For. measures\nModel AIC SIC RMSE MAPE\n\nGARCH(1,1) 6043 6028 1.002 27.32%\nAPARCH(2,2) 6039 6013 1.001 25.01%\nEGARCH(1,1) 6037 6019 1.003 29.07%\nFIGARCH(1,1) 6037 6023 0.997 30.02%\nFIAPARCH(3,3) 6032 5999 0.996 30.39%\n\nTable 4.10: In-sample evaluation for the daily models.\n\nduction of the long memory characteristic has a positive impact on both GARCH(1,1)\n\nand APARCH(2,2), as the AIC and SIC measures decreases. This idea is corrobo-\n\nrated with the RMSE values, though the conclusions when checking the MAPE are\n\ncontradictory.\n\nSo, we continued the forecasting and model selection analysis, but now we evaluated\n\nthe out-of-sample forecasts. The results, illustrated in Table 4.11 show that the RSME\n\nand MAPE values for the proposed models are very similar.\n\n40\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nGARCH(1,1) APARCH(2,2) EGARCH(1,1) FIGARCH(1,1) FIAPARCH(3,3)\nRMSE 5.699 5.432 5.494 5.795 5.773\nMAPE 6.79% 6.46% 6.54% 6.90% 6.88%\n\nTable 4.11: Out-of-sample forecast accuracy evaluation for the daily models.\n\nMoreover, we computed the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test, in order to compare the\n\nforecast accuracy of the di?erent prediction samples. This test, implemented in the\n\nR software by Hyndman (2010), was computed for the proposed di?erent models, and\n\nthe results are shown in Table A.17. We can conclude that although the models have\n\nvery similar prediction error values, their forecasting samples are statistically di?erent.\n\nWhen we compare the values of the DM test statistic for the proposed models we\n\nverify that the models that incorporate the long memory characteristic show a better\n\npredictive ability. Therefore, and to conclude, we decided to select the FIGARCH(1,1)\n\nmodel as our ?nal daily model, since it is the one that presents the highest predictive\n\naccuracy, according to the results of the Diebold-Mariano test.\n\n4.4.2 Monthly Brent Prices\n\nWe now present the results for the monthly Brent prices. Analogous to the procedure\n\nfor the daily data, we started with the in-sample analysis and in Table 4.12 we illustrate\n\nthe obtained results. The information criteria measures, unlike the daily case, are not\n\nInf. criteria For. measures\nModel AIC SIC RMSE MAPE\nAR(6) 95 83 5.298 7.92%\n\nSETAR(2) 369 - 4.301 7.01%\nMS-AR(2) -344 -358 3.104 5.71%\n\nTable 4.12: In-sample evaluation for the monthly models.\n\nvery useful in this context, as we are comparing models of di?erent classes. Regarding\n\nthe forecast accuracy measures and though the results are very similar, we verify that\n\nthe MS-AR(2) model is the one that presents the best in-sample ?tting.\n\nNext, we followed with the out-of-sample analysis, whose results are shown in Ta-\n\nble 4.13. We have compared the predicted values from the three models with the real\n\nmonthly prices of Brent for October 2009 until October 2010, for a one year and a\n\nmonth period. Once again, the results are very similar. Finally, and in order to check\n\nAR(6) SETAR(2) MS-AR(2)\nRMSE 13.390 19.578 13.172\nMAPE 16.49% 19.78% 16.36%\n\nTable 4.13: Out-of-sample forecast accuracy evaluation for the monthly models.\n\n41\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nif the di?erences from the three forecasting samples are statistically signi?cant, we\n\ncomputed the Diebold-Mariano (DM) test. We applied the DM test implemented in R\n\n(see Hyndman (2010)) and the results, presented in Table A.18, indicate that the null\n\nhypothesis is always rejected, meaning that there is a di?erence statistically signi?cant\n\namong the three forecasting samples.\n\nTherefore, we chose the SETAR(2) model as our monthly ?nal model since it is\n\nthe one that, according to the results from the Diebold-Mariano test, has the highest\n\npredictive accuracy. We also remark that this model is very interesting as it considers\n\ntwo di?erent regimes depending on the Brent prices characteristics.\n\n42\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nConclusion\n\nDuring the past years, the Brent commodity has become the most important source\n\nof energy in the world, and due to its impact on society it has turned into an issue of\n\nmajor concern. Therefore, the aim of this work is to analyse, understand and forecast\n\nthe Brent prices behaviour. To model and predict the Brent prices we considered\n\ndata on a daily and monthly basis, and we used long memory time series models and\n\nregime-switching models.\n\nFor the daily Brent prices analysis we considered historical data from the fourth\n\nof January 2000 until the 31st of December 2009, for a total of 2560 observations.\n\nThe results show that the daily data set should be modelled with long memory time\n\nseries models, as there is evidence of long-range dependence on the conditional variance\n\nof the Brent prices. The selected model is the FIGARCH(1,1) applied to the Brent\n\nprices returns since it is the one, according to the Diebold-Mariano test, that presents\n\nthe highest predictive accuracy. To the daily data we also applied regime-switching\n\nmodels, but the results suggest that the data should be modelled by linear models, as\n\nthe hypothesis of non-linearity is rejected.\n\nThe monthly Brent prices analysis was done considering the monthly average of the\n\ndaily prices from January 2000 until September 2009, for a total of 117 observations.\n\nThe reason why we did not use the data until the end of the year, as we have done for\n\nthe daily case, was to guarantee an out-of-sample period of one year. The conclusions\n\nfor the monthly Brent prices analysis are quite di?erent from the ones obtained for\n\nthe daily data. Regarding time series models, we identi?ed an AR(6) model for the\n\nmonthly returns, and neither conditional heterokedasticity nor long-range dependence\n\nwere identi?ed. The regime-switching models were also applied and we chose the\n\ntwo-regime SETAR(2) model as, according to the DM test, it is the one with the\n\nhighest predictive accuracy. This model is very interesting as it shows clear di?erences\n\nbetween the two identi?ed regimes. While the ?rst regime, represented by the majority\n\n\n\nModelling and Forecasting Brent Prices\n\nof observations, exhibits the lowest Brent prices and the highest variation, the other\n\nregime has the opposite characteristics, i.e., the highest Brent prices and the lowest\n\nvariation. Besides, regime one lasts for almost two years while the second state has a\n\nduration of only a few months.\n\nIn this analysis we were not able to identify a strong relation between stochastic\n\nregime-switching and long memory. Nonetheless, we think that for a future investiga-\n\ntion a very interesting topic to analyse is the application of regime-switching models\n\nto the conditional variance of the daily Brent prices.\n\nFinally, we present the main contributions of this thesis for the econometric and\n\n?nancial literature concerning the Brent prices modelling and forecasting.\n\nFirst, to model and predict the Brent prices we consider long memory time series\n\nmodels and regime-switching models and compare their predictive accuracy. Concern-\n\ning time series models, several models are used to capture the long memory in the\n\nBrent prices returns and some of them, namely FIAPARCH and FIEGARCH mod-\n\nels are not so commonly used in the econometric literature. We note that the long\n\nmemory characteristic is tested simultaneously in the conditional mean and variance.\n\nFor regime-switching models we analyse and compare if the Brent prices are better\n\ndescribed by its past behaviour or by an unobservable and unknown variable.\n\nAnother interesting issue is the parallel analysis made for both daily and monthly\n\nBrent prices that leads to very di?erent and interesting conclusions. At last, and in\n\norder to capture the models prediction accuracy we do not use just the traditional\n\ncriteria, such as MAPE and RMSE measures, but we also apply the Diebold-Mariano\n\ntest to check if the di?erences in the forecast accuracy are statistically signi?cant.\n\n44\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nAntonio, F.
