Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s suas antecessoras, estas novas nanopart\u00edculas \napresentam uma estrutura mais elaborada, integrando v\u00e1rios componentes \nativos com diferentes funcionalidades que, em princ\u00edpio, permitem realizar \ndiversas tarefas em simult\u00e2neo (como o direcionamento ativo para \ndeterminadas c\u00e9lulas ou compartimentos celulares, imagem e liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de \nf\u00e1rmacos). Estas nanopart\u00edculas s\u00e3o designadas, por isso, de nanopart\u00edculas \nmultifuncionais. \n\nA presente disserta\u00e7\u00e3o relata o desenvolvimento de dois tipos de sondas \nbimodais e as propriedades f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas destas, nomeadamente a sua \ntextura, estrutura e relaxometria e din\u00e2mica de \n\n1\nH , com o objectivo de avaliar \n\no seu potencial como agentes de contraste para Imagem por Resson\u00e2ncia \nMagn\u00e9tica Nuclear (IRM). S\u00e3o, tamb\u00e9m, apresentados estudos de \nfotoluminesc\u00eancia que permitem avaliar o potencial daquelas sondas para \nserem usadas como agentes de contraste \u00f3ptico. Estes materiais combinam as \npropriedades dos complexos de lantan\u00eddeos trivalentes (Ln\n\n3+\n) e das NPs \n\nfuncionando, assim, como agentes bimodais. \n\nForam desenvolvidos os seguintes sistemas fotoluminescentes e com \ncontraste T1 em IRM em que os i\u00f5es Ln\n\n3+\n magnetica (Gd\n\n3+\n) e opticamente \n\n(Eu\n3+\n\n, Tb\n3+\n\n) activos se encontram \u00e0 superf\u00edcie das NPs de s\u00edlica: \nSiO2@APS/DTPA:Gd:Ln e SiO2@APS/Pyd-DTPA:Gd:Ln (Ln = Eu ou Tb). No \nque respeita \u00e0s propriedades de  relaxometria, na presen\u00e7a destas NPs \nobserva-se um aumento moderado de r1 e consider\u00e1vel de r2, especialmente a \ncampos magn\u00e9ticos altos (devido aos efeitos de susceptibilidade para r2). Os \ni\u00f5es Eu\n\n3+\n apresentam um \u00fanico ambiente local de baixa simetria, sendo que a \n\nemiss\u00e3o de fotoluminesc\u00eancia n\u00e3o \u00e9 influenciada pela presen\u00e7a simult\u00e2nea de \nGd\n\n3+\n e Eu\n\n3+\n. Verificou-se que a presen\u00e7a de Tb\n\n3+\n (em lugar do i\u00e3o Eu\n\n3+\n) \n\naumenta ainda mais o valor r1, diminuindo r2. A internaliza\u00e7\u00e3o das NPs em \nc\u00e9lulas vivas \u00e9 r\u00e1pida e resulta num aumento de intensidade nas imagens \nponderadas em T1. Foram estudadas as caracter\u00edsticas \u00f3pticas de pastilhas de \nc\u00e9lulas (\u201ccellular pellets\u201d) contendo NPs, tendo-se confirmado o interesse das \nnovas sondas propostas enquanto agentes para imagem bimodal. \n\nEsta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o relata, ainda, agentes com contraste em T2 para IRM, que \nconsistem em um sistema n\u00facleo-coroa (\u201ccore-shell\u201d) em que \u00e9 ajust\u00e1vel a \nespessura da coroa de s\u00edlica envolvendo o n\u00facleo de \u00f3xido de ferro. A \nespessura do revestimento de s\u00edlica tem um efeito significativo sobre a \nrelaxividade r2 e r2* , sendo aqui proposto um modelo para explicar este \ncomportamento. A viabilidade celular e a express\u00e3o da desidrogenase \nmitocondrial das c\u00e9lulas da microglia foram tamb\u00e9m avaliadas. \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nkeywords \n\n \nMultifunctional nanoparticles, core-shell/corona, silica, Fe2O3, \nlanthanides, MRI contrast agents, optical contrast agents, relaxometric, \nRMRD, photoluminescence  \n\nabstract \n\n \nIn the past few years a new generation of multifunctional nanoparticles \n(NPs) has been proposed for biomedical applications, whose structure is \nmore complex than the structure of their predecessor monofunctional \ncounterparts. The development of these novel NPs aims at enabling or \nimproving the performance in imaging, diagnosis and therapeutic \napplications. The structure of such NPs comprises several components \nexhibiting various functionalities that enable the nanoparticles to perform \nmultiple tasks simultaneously, such as active targeting of certain cells or \ncompartmentalization, imaging and delivery of active drugs. \n\nThis thesis presents two types of bimodal bio-imaging probes and \ndescribes their physical and chemical properties, namely their texture, \nstructure, and \n\n1\nH dynamics and relaxometry, in order to evaluate their \n\npotential as MRI contrast agents. The photoluminescence properties of \nthese probes are studied, aiming at assessing their interest as optical \ncontrast agents. These materials combine the properties of the trivalent \nlanthanide (Ln\n\n3+\n) complexes and nanoparticles, offering an excellent \n\nsolution for bimodal imaging. \n\nThe designed T1- type contrast agent are SiO2@APS/DTPA:Gd:Ln or \nSiO2@APS/PMN:Gd:Ln (Ln= Eu or Tb) systems, bearing the active \nmagnetic center (Gd\n\n3+\n) and the optically-active ions (Eu\n\n3+\n and Tb\n\n3+\n) on \n\nthe surface of silica NPs. Concerning the relaxometry properties, \nmoderate r1 increases and significant r2 increases are observed in the \nNPs presence, especially at high magnetic fields, due to susceptibility \neffects on r2. The Eu\n\n3+\n ions reside in a single low-symmetry site, and the \n\nphotoluminescence emission is not influenced by the simultaneous \npresence of Gd\n\n3+\n and Eu\n\n3+\n. The presence of Tb\n\n3+\n, rather than Eu\n\n3+\n ion, \n\nfurther increases r1 but decreases r2. The uptake of these NPs by living \ncells is fast and results in an intensity increase in the T1-weighted MRI \nimages. The optical features of the NPs in cellular pellets are also studied \nand confirm the potential of these new nanoprobes as bimodal imaging \nagents. \n\nThis thesis further reports on a T2 contrast agent consisting of core-shell \nNPs with a silica shell surrounding an iron oxide core. The thickness of \nthis silica shell has a significant impact on the r2 and r2* relaxivities, and a \ntentative model is proposed to explain this finding. The cell viability and \nthe mitochondrial dehydrogenase expression given by the microglial cells \nare also evaluated. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nMots cl\u00e9s \n\n \nNanoparticules multifonctionnelles, coeur-\u00e9corce/couronne, silice, Fe2O3,  \nlanthanides, agents de contraste IRM, agents de contraste optiques, \nrelaxom\u00e9trie, RMRD, photoluminescence \n\nresum\u00e9e \n\n \nCette th\u00e8se d\u00e9crit une strat\u00e9gie de synth\u00e8se de nouvelles g\u00e9n\u00e9rations \ndes nanoparticules (NPs) pour applications biom\u00e9dicales, visant \u00e0 une \nam\u00e9lioration de leurs performances pour l\u2019imagerie, le diagnostic \nth\u00e9rapeutique.

Final Conclusions and Future Work  \n\nFinal Conclusions and Future Work  211 \n\n\n\n  \n\nNomenclature, symbols and \nacronyms  \n\nB0: The static, homogeneous magnetic field used to polarize spins, \n\ncreating magnetization. This can refer to both the direction and the \n\nmagnitude of the field. The direction of B0 defines the longitudinal axis.  \n\nB1: Magnetic component of a radio-frequency field applied perpendicular \n\nto the longitudinal axis (B0) to perturb the magnetization in some manner \n\n(e.g., excitation pulses, inversion pulses, etc).  \n\nBOLD, or blood oxygenation level dependent: The BOLD effect is the \n\nsource of contrast in FMRI. The presence of deoxygenated blood leads to \n\nsignal loss due to a reduction in T2*.  \n\nBPA: Blood pool agents. \n\nContrast Agent (CA): A substance that enhances contrast, i.e., shortens \n\nthe relaxation time of water molecules, making them appear \u2018brighter\u2019 in \n\nT1 or T2 weighted MR images. \n\nDephasing: In an ensemble of spins, each has a phase angle in the \n\ntransverse plane. The ensemble can either be coherent (have the same \n\nangle) or incoherent (varying angle). Loss of coherence is referred to as \n\n\"dephasing\", which leads to net signal loss. BOLD and diffusion contrast \n\nare both based on dephasing.  \n\nDNP: Dynamic nuclear polarization. \n\nEcho time (TE): The time between the excitation of magnetization and the \n\nacquisition of signal. For long acquisition windows, the TE is usually \n\ndefined as the point at which the acquisition is closest to the center of k-\n\nspace. \n\nED: Electric-dipole. \n\nEmission quantum efficiency (?): the fraction of emission processes in \n\nwhich emission of light is involved: \n\nNRADRAD\n\nRAD\n\nRAD\n\nEXP\n\nAA\n\nA\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n\n?\n? . \n\n \n\nEmission quantum yield (?): the ratio of the number of photons emitted \n\nand the absorbed: \nphotonsabsorvedofnumber\n\nphotonsemittedofnumber\n\n???\n\n???\n?? . \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nii \n\n  \n\nNomenclature, symbols and \nacronyms (cont.) \n\nExtracellular fluid agents (ECF): are the contrast agents that have been in \n\nclinical use for the longest period of time in contrast-enhanced MR \n\nimaging of the liver. \n\nFrequency encode (FE) direction: The direction along which individual \n\nlines are acquired in k-space. Note that one may also refer to the \n\nfrequency encode direction in the image (i.e., if the FE direction is along \n\nkx, one may also refer to the x direction in image space as the FE \n\ndirection). See also phase encode (PE) direction.  \n\nGradient: Spatially varying magnetic field used to manipulate the \n\nresonance frequency across an object. MRI scanners incorporate three \n\nlinearly-varying gradient fields across x, y and z. The strength of the \n\ngradient is controlled by the pulse sequence and can be rapidly \n\nmanipulated (or \"switched\"). \n\nGradient echo, or GRE/GE: Any MRI sequence that detects an un-\n\nrefocused signal (i.e., a non-spin-echo sequence). \n\nInner Coordination Sphere. Used to describe any water molecules that \n\nare directly coordinated to the metal ion of a contrast agent. \n\nInversion: Rotation of magnetization from alignment with B0 (along +z) to \n\nanti-alignment (along -z), caused by a RF pulse with 180\u00ba flip angle.  \n\nInversion time (IT): The time between inversion of magnetization and its \n\nexcitation (often to acquire signal that has been \"prepared\" with an \n\ninversion pulse). \n\nk-space: The conceptual space in which MRI images are acquired. Data \n\nin k-space provides a map of the amount of structure in the image that \n\ncan be attributed to each spatial frequency. The image and k-space are \n\nrelated by the mathematical operation called the Fourier transform (FT). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\niii \n\n  \n\nNomenclature, symbols and \nacronyms (cont.) \n\nLarmor frequency: See resonance frequency. \n\nLLBs: Lanthanide luminescent bioprobes. \n\nLMCT: ligand to-metal charge-transfer. \n\nLongitudinal axis (z): The direction parallel to the main magnetic field (B0), \n\nwhich represents the direction along which magnetization is in \n\nequilibrium. After an RF pulse, the magnetization recovers to this \n\nequilibrium according to the rate T1. The component of magnetization \n\nalong z cannot be detected.  \n\nMD: Magnetic dipole. \n\nMagnetization: The net nuclear magnetic moment induced in an object or \n\ntissue when exposed to an external magnetic field. The magnetization is \n\nat equilibrium when it is aligned parallel to the external field (along the \n\nlongitudinal axis) and at its maximum magnitude. MRI experiments \n\nmanipulate the magnetization away from this equilibrium, into the \n\ntransverse plane to detect its signal. \n\nMRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a non-invasive technique using \n\nstrong magnetic fields and radiofrequency pulses to create images of \n\ninternal anatomy. \n\nNIR: Near-infrared. \n\nNPs: Nanoparticles. \n\nNMR: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, an analytical technique commonly \n\nemployed in chemistry. \n\nNMRD. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Dispersion profile. \n\nOCT: Optical coherence tomography. \n\nOuter Coordination Sphere: Used to describe any water molecules that \n\nare not in the inner- or second-coordination spheres.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\niv \n\n  \n\nNomenclature, symbols and \nacronyms (cont.) \n\nPARACEST: Paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer. \n\nPHIP: Parahydrogen-induced polarization. \n\nPET: Positron-emission tomography. \n\nPhase: In MRI, phase most commonly refers to the angle of the \n\nmagnetization in the transverse plane. \n\nPhase encode (PE) direction: The direction perpendicular to individual \n\nlines in k-space. Note that one may also refer to the phase encode \n\ndirection in the image (i.e., if the PE direction is along ky, one may also \n\nrefer to the y direction in image space as the PE direction). Image \n\nartefacts are often most severe along the PE direction. See also \n\nfrequency encode (FE) direction. \n\nPolarization: The tendency for spins to align in the presence of an \n\nexternal magnetic field, creating a net magnetic moment (or, \n\nmagnetization). \n\nPrecession: Gyration of a spinning body, which traces out a cone about \n\nthe axis of precession. In MRI, the magnetization that is out of alignment \n\nwith the longitudinal axis precesses about this axis. \n\nRelaxation Time: The time it takes nuclear spins to return to their \n\nequilibrium state after excitation by an RF pulse.  \n\nRelaxivity: The ability of a contrast agent to shorten the relaxation time of \n\nnearby water protons. The higher the relaxivity, the shorter the relaxation \n\ntime. \n\nPulse sequence: The series of RF pulses, gradient field amplitudes and \n\nacquisition periods applied to acquire a spectrum or an image. Also used \n\nto refer to sets of sequences with common properties (e.g., the family of \n\nspin echo pulse sequences include structural and diffusion variants). \n\nQDs: Quantum dots. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nv \n\n  \n\nNomenclature, symbols and \nacronyms (cont.) \n\nR1: The expression of time constant T1 as a rate: R1=1/T1.  \n\nR2: The expression of time constant T2 as a rate: R2=1/T2.  \n\nRelaxation: The process by which the magnetization slowly returns to \n\nequilibrium following the rotation of the magnetization away from the \n\nlongitudinal axis with an RF pulse. Relaxation (decay) in the transverse \n\nplane has the characteristic time T2; relaxation (recovery) along the \n\nlongitudinal axis has characteristic time T1. \n\nRefocusing: The rotation of magnetization in the transverse plane by \n\n180\u00ba, usually with the intention of removing the effect of field \n\ninhomogeneities on signal.  \n\nRepetition time (TR): The time between repeated excitations of a given \n\ncomponent of the magnetization. For multi-slice sequences that \n\nsequentially excite different imaging slices, the TR is the time between \n\nrepeated excitations of the same slice. For volume-excite (3D) sequences \n\nthat repeated excite the entire imaging volume, the TR is the time \n\nbetween repeated excitations of the volume. \n\nResonance frequency (?0): The frequency at which the magnetization \n\ncan be excited and detected. The frequency varies directly with magnetic \n\nfield strength, and is normally in the radio frequency (RF) range. Also \n\ncalled Larmor frequency. \n\nRF pulse: A brief transmission of energy in the RF range. In MRI, RF \n\npulses are used to manipulate the direction of the magnetization (e.g., to \n\nexcite or invert). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nvi \n\n  \n\nNomenclature, symbols and \nacronyms (cont.) \n\nSaturation: Removal or reduction of a component of the magnetization \n\nusing excitation into the transverse plane. Most commonly used to in the \n\ncontext of \"T1 saturation\", where repeated excitations of magnetization \n\nresult in incomplete T1 recovery, and therefore signal reduction. Can also \n\nrefer to an excitation followed by a \"spoiling\" mechanism, which \n\ndeliberately removes signal. \n\nSecond Coordination Sphere. Used to describe any water molecules that \n\nare coordinated to only the contrast agent ligand, not to the metal ion \n\ninside a contrast agent. For example, a water molecule that is hydrogen \n\nbound to a polar group on the ligand. \n\nShimming: The process of improving field homogeneity by compensating \n\nfor imbalances in the main magnetic field of an MRI system. \n\nAccomplished by a combination of constant (\"passive\") shims and \n\ncontrollable (\"active\") shim coils. \n\nSpin: The property exhibited by atomic nuclei that contain an odd number \n\nof protons and/or neutrons. The property spin causes nuclei to behave as \n\nthough they are spinning charges. These nuclei are often referred to \n\ncolloquially as \"spins\". \n\nSpin echo, or SE: Any MRI pulse sequence characterized by the use of a \n\nrefocusing pulse to reverse the effect of off-resonance precession. The \n\nsignal is said to form a spin echo when the off-resonance precession of all \n\nspins is reversed, such that the spins re-align to form a signal peak (or \n\n\"echo\"). \n\nT1: The time constant defining the rate of recovery of magnetization along \n\nthe longitudinal (z) axis following an RF pulse. Also called the spin-lattice \n\nrelaxation time.  \n\nT2: The time constant defining the irreversible loss of magnetization (and \n\ntherefore signal) in the transverse (xy) plane following excitation. Also \n\ncalled the spin-spin relaxation time. In tissue, T2 is shorter than T1 (often \n\nby an order of magnitude). This signal loss cannot be recovered by a spin \n\necho.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nvii \n\n  \n\nNomenclature, symbols and \nacronyms (cont.) \n\nT2*: The time constant defining the loss of signal following excitation. Two \n\ncomponents contribute to T2*. First, some signal loss occurs due to T2 \n\nrelaxation (i.e., loss of magnetization). Second, some signal loss is \n\ncaused by variation in precession angles for different spins within a voxel. \n\nThis does not represent loss of magnetization, and this component can be \n\nrecovered wiwth a spin echo. \n\nT1M and T2M: The longitudinal and transverse proton relaxation \n\nenhancement experienced by the inner-sphere water molecules, \n\nrespectively. \n\nTRL: Time-resolved luminescent. \n\nTransverse plane: The plane orthogonal to the longitudinal axis, denoted \n\nas the xy plane. It is defined by the direction of the main (B0) field, and the \n\nplane in which the magnetization is observable (i.e., where signal can be \n\ndetected). \n\nVoxel: A resolution element in a 3D imaging experiment (coming from the \n\nterm \"volume element\"); the 3D extension of a pixel (a \"picture element\"). \n\nC: the molar concentration of the paramagnetic complex. \n\nq: the number of water molecules in the inner-coordination sphere directly \n\ncoordinated to the paramagnetic centre. \n\n??M:  the chemical shift difference between the free and the bound water \n\nmolecules. \n\n?: the proton gyromagnetic ratio. \n\n?M: the mean residence lifetime of the coordinated water protons within \n\nthe inner-sphere coordination sphere. \n\n?R: The rotational correlation time of a contrast agent. This is related to \n\nhow fast the contrast is physically tumbling in solution. \n\n?RAD: Radiative lifetime. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nviii \n\n \n\n\n\n 1 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1. \n\nIntroduction \n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n 2 \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.1.

CONTEXT OF THE THESIS \n\n \n\nNanomedicine is defined as the medical application technology in the nanometer \n\nrange (ranging from biomedical imaging to drug delivery and therapeutics.\n1\n This is a new, \n\nfast expanding and growing medical field. The overall goals of traditional medicine and \n\nnanomedicine are the same: early and accurate diagnosis, effective treatments, free from \n\nside effects and non\u2013invasive evaluation of the efficacy of the treatment. Nanotechnology \n\nused in nanomedicine brings not only improvements to the existing techniques but also \n\nprovides completely new tools and capabilities.\n2,3 \n\n \n\nNanotechnology is the study, understanding and control of matter at dimensions in \n\nthe range of 1 to ~100 nanometres, where unique phenomena enable novel applications.\n4\n \n\nIt is a very broad interdisciplinary research field that involves various areas of science, \n\nsuch as chemistry, physics, engineering, biology and medicine, while eroding the \n\ntraditional boundaries between them.\n5\n \n\n \n\nIndeed, there is a radical change in the physical and chemical properties of \n\nmaterials as their size is scaled down to small clusters of atoms. When the size decreases \n\nthe surface-area-to-volume ratio increases, since there is a larger percentage of surface \n\natoms compared with bulk materials.\n6\n As nanodevices in the same range of dimension as \n\nantibodies, membrane receptors, nucleic acids and proteins, among other biomolecules \n\nthe can possess biomimetic features.\n7\n \n\n \n\nGiven all these outstanding features nanoparticles are powerful tools for imaging, \n\ndiagnosis and therapy. Over the last few years, a new generation of nanoparticles has \n\narisen with improved performances for the same type of applications and with a more \n\ncomplex structure compared to the simpler monofunctional nanoparticles. These complex \n\nnanoparticles comprise different components that can carry out various functions, which \n\nenable these nanoparticles to perform multiple tasks simultaneously (active targeting a \n\ngiven type of cells or compartment, imaging them and delivering an active compound). For \n\nexample, a core particle may be linked to a specific targeting functional group that \n\nrecognises the unique surface signatures of the target cells. The same particle can be \n\nmodified with an imaging functional group to monitor the drug transport process, a \n\nmolecular entity to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a drug, a specific cellular \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n 4 \n\npenetration moiety and a therapeutic agent.\n7\n Therefore, these complex nanoparticles are \n\ntermed multifunctional nanoparticles.\n8\n A schematic representation of these systems is \n\ngiven in Figure 1.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1.

As their sizes vary from 100 nm up to a few micrometers they can \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n 6 \n\ncarry within their phospholipid bilayered membrane different types of vesicles (e.g. small \n\nmolecules to proteins, peptides, DNA, magnetic nanoparticles).\n29,30,31\n\n  \n\nLiposomes are generally considered non-toxic, biodegradable and non-\n\nimmunogenic, although recently some adverse effects have been described.\n.32\n\n Although \n\nthe underlying mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated, it appears that the choice of \n\nliposome characteristics plays an important role and that choosing the appropriate lipids \n\nand their size helps to overcome these unexpected effects.\n33,34\n\n \n\nPEGylation is the process of covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol polymer \n\nchains to another molecule, normally a drug or therapeutic protein. By employing \n\nPEGylation the circulation time is increased and by combining the liposomes with a \n\ntherapeutic agent the multifunctionality of the vesicles is increased.\n35\n\n \n\nMicelles (lipid vesicles of 20 to 100 nm) present similar features as liposomes (long \n\ncirculating behaviour, high biocompatibility and the possibility of increasing the \n\nfunctionality number). They also offer a better method of delivering hydrophobic drugs. In \n\nthis system, the hydrophobic parts form the core to minimize their exposure to aqueous \n\nsurroundings, whereas the hydrophilic blocks form the corona-like shell that stabilizes the \n\ncore through direct contact with water.\n36\n\n The hydrophobic core is capable of carrying \n\npharmaceuticals (poorly water soluble drugs), with high loading capacity (5\u201325% weight), \n\nwhile its hydrophilic shell provides not only a steric protection for the micelle (with \n\nincreased stability in blood) but also functional groups suitable for further micelle \n\nmodification.\n37\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPolymeric carriers (polymeric or dendrimers) \n\n \n\nThe polymeric carriers are formed by a hydrophobic core that is capable of carrying \n\npharmaceuticals (poorly water soluble drugs) with high loading capacity (5\u201325% weight) \n\nand a hydrophilic shell that provides not only a steric protection for the micelle (with \n\nincreased stability in blood) but also functional groups suitable for further micelle \n\nmodification (repeated relative to previous phrase, reword)\n38,39\n\n, such as starch,\n40\n\n \n\npoly(ethylene glycol) \u2013PEG,\n41,42\n\n poly(lactic-coglycolic acid) -PLGA\n43,44\n\n). \n\nDendrimers are a relatively novel class of synthetic polymers with highly ordered \n\nstructure. They are highly branched (<15 nm) and have layered architectures consisting of \n\na central core, an internal region and numerous terminal groups that determine dendrimer \n\ncharacteristics.\n7 \n\nThey present a highly interbranched cavity density, therefore a high \n\n\n\n 7 \n\ndensity of functional groups on the surface. Their functionalisation possibilities, symmetry \n\nperfection, diameters in the range of 10 to 100 nm and internal cavities provide many \n\npotential applications in biochemistry, gene therapy and nanomedicine. Nanoparticles \n\ncoated with dendrimers can alter the charge, functionality, reactivity and enhance their \n\nboth stability and dispersibility.\n45,46,47 \n\n \n\n \n\nCore \u2013 shell/corona structures (Inorganic or magnetic nanoparticles, \n\nquantum dots or carbon nanotubes)  \n\n \n\nThe core \u2013 shell/corona architecture is another attractive alternative approach for \n\ndeveloping multifunctional nanoparticles. These structures normally comprise optical, \n\ntargeting and delivery functions. Nanoparticles visualisation is normally achieved through \n\nthe core\u2019s functionality. The shell/corona protects the core and acts as the scaffold for \n\nadding further functions, such as drug delivery (drugs are incorporated and released in a \n\ncontrolled manner, either via diffusion or active delivery via pH), temperature modulation, \n\nactive targeting (through surface modification with specific ligands), or even a tool for an \n\nalternative way of visualisation through the incorporation of a different imaging agent. A \n\nlarge variety of combinations of materials that are assembled in core-shell/corona \n\narchitecture can be found in the literature as the core quantum dots\n48,49,50\n\n, fluorophores\n51\n\n \n\nor magnetic nanoparticles\n52,53\n\n are the most researched moieties. The most commonly \n\nused coating layers are either organic layers (polymethyl methacrylate) (PMMA),\n54\n\n \n\npolylactic acid (PLA),\n55,56\n\n poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA),\n 26,43\n\n polyvinyl alcohol \n\n(PVA)\n25,57\n\n) or inorganic materials as silica (amorphous,\n58\n\n mesoporous\n59\n\n), apatite,\n60\n\n or have \n\na metallic layer of gold\n61\n\n or silver.\n62\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nExtensive in vivo application of nanoparticles will require a more exhaustive \n\nexploration of the physicochemical and physiological processes occurring in the biological \n\nenvironments. The smallest capillaries in the human body are 4-6 ?m in diameter. When \n\nconsidering possible medical applications (both in-vivo or in-vitro) the nanoparticles have \n\nto possess some basic properties. Specifically they must have a size of less than 20 nm \n\n(especially for intraveneous (i.v.) administration), high surface area with a larger platform \n\nfor surface functionalisation, high colloidal stability (with minimum agglomeration and \n\naggregation) and the ability to overcome biological barriers.\n63\n\n For the particular case of in-\n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n 8 \n\nvivo applications the particles should adhere to more strict requirements: non-toxicity, \n\nnon-immunogenicity, long term retention during blood circulation and the ability to reach, \n\nand pass through, the endothelial capillary membranes without causing an embolism of \n\nthe bigger vessels.\n64,65\n\n  \n\nThe three major applications of nanoparticles in medicine are imaging (diagnosis), \n\ndrug delivery (therapeutics) and cell reconstruction. In this thesis I report the design and \n\nsynthesis of nanoparticles for bi-modal imaging with potential to be further developed in \n\nthe future with the addition of cell-targeting agents and drug delivery molecules. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.2. SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF THIS THESIS \n\n \n\nNanoparticles have to meet several specifications in order to be applied in-vivo and \n\nin-vitro. Important features these particles should have are a small overall size, high \n\nsurface area for surface functionalisation, high colloidal stability and the ability to pass the \n\nbiological barriers. \n\nTo achieve the proposed objective two sets of contrast agents were designed, \n\nsynthesized and characterized: \n\n \n\n? T1 contrast agent with an optical Ln\n3+\n\n probe \n\n \n\nThe nanoparticles we will consider are hybrid inorganic-organic SiO2@APS \n\ncore-corona. Lanthanide chelates are linked onto these particles, for their \n\nrelaxometry (Gd\n3+\n\n) and luminescence (Eu\n3+\n\n or Tb\n3+\n\n) properties. Subsequently, \n\nthese nanoparticles are internalised in living cells in the form of cellular pellets \n\nin order to confirm their potential as new probes for bimodal imaging. \n\n  \n\n? T2 contrast agent  \n\n \n\nThese are core-shell nanoparticles, Fe2O3@SiO2. The influence of the silica \n\nshell on the relaxometry and cytotoxicity properties was studied. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 9 \n\n1.3. OUTLINE OF THIS THESIS \n\n \n\nThis thesis is organised in six chapters, as follows. \n\n \n\nChapter 1 provides an overview of different multifunctional nanoparticles for \n\napplications in medicine. \n\nChapter 2 presents a general introduction of magnetic resonance imaging and MRI \n\ncontrast agents, as well as the parameters governing the relaxivity of the latter, presenting \n\na summary of the various classes of contrast agents, classified according to their \n\napplications. \n\nChapter 3 gives a brief introduction to optical imaging and its main applications are \n\npresented. A short overview is provided of the photoluminescence phenomenon, in \n\nparticular of trivalent lanthanides. The optical properties of tissues are succinctly \n\ndescribed as well as the different techniques available for optical imaging. A summary of \n\nthe various types of optical contrast agents is also presented. \n\nChapter 4 describes the synthesis of T1 contrast agents, with an optical Ln\n3+\n\n probe \n\nattached. In order to optimise the nanoparticles emission, two types of chelating agents, \n\nwith and without an aromatic ring, were used. The physical and chemical properties were \n\nstudied by several different techniques. The uptake of these nanoparticles by living RAW \n\ncells was evaluated using cellular pellets. The optical and magnetic features of these \n\nprobes in the cellular pellet were assessed in order to confirm their potential as bimodal \n\nimaging agents. \n\nChapter 5 reports the synthesis both, the core of the magnetic iron oxide \n\nnanoparticles, with a well-defined size, and the silica shellI shall show that the silica-shell \n\nthickness determines the relaxometry properties, and I shall propose a tentative \n\ntheoretical to explain this fact. The effect of these nanoparticles on the viability and the \n\nmitochondrial dehydrogenase expression of microglial cells were also evaluated. The \n\nmagnetic properties of these nanoparticles and their T1 relaxivities as a function of the \n\nexternal magnetic field (Nuclear Magnetic Relaxation Dispersion (NMRD) plots) were also \n\nstudied in detail and rationalized on the basis of current theory.  \n\nFinally, chapter 6 presents the concluding remarks of this thesis and an outlook for \n\nthe future. \n\n\n\n \nIntroduction \n\n 10 \n\n \n\n1.4.

MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING \n\n \n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive diagnostic tool providing high-\n\nresolution ( m? ?scale) anatomical images of soft tissue and allowing the quantitative \n\nassessment of disease pathogenesis by measuring up-regulated biomarkers. MRI is \n\nbased on the principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), a spectroscopic \n\ntechnique applied by scientists to obtain microscopic chemical and physical information \n\nabout molecules. \n\nFelix Bloch and Edward Purcell independently discovered the phenomenon of \n\nmagnetic resonance in 1946 and for this they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1952. Until \n\nthe 1970s the NMR technique was used only for chemical and physical analysis. The first \n\nstep towards the discovery of the magnetic resonance was taken in 1971 by Raymond \n\nDamadian who showed that the nuclear magnetic relaxation times of healthy and \n\npathogenic tissues are different.\n1\n It was only in 1973, however, that imaging moved from \n\nthe single dimension of NMR spectroscopy to the second dimension of spatial orientation \n\nwith the discovery of NMR-zero field gradients by Paul Lauterbur. He published this new \n\nimaging technique in a short and concise paper in Nature entitled \"Image formation by \n\ninduced local interaction; examples employing magnetic resonance\".\n2\n \n\nMRI is an extension of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy used in chemistry. \n\nThe nuclei of certain atoms have an inherent magnetic dipole moment resulting from their \n\nelectrical charge and spin. If these nuclei are placed in a strong, static magnetic field,\n0\n\nB , \n\nthey precess around it at the Larmor frequency, \nI\n\n? . The energy levels of the spins are \n\ndetermined by their orientation along the axis parallel to \n0\n\nB  (either with or against \n0\n\nB ). \n\nThere are more spins aligned with the field (parallel - low energy state) than spins aligned \n\nagainst the field (anti-parallel- high energy state). Due to this slight excess of parallel \n\nspins, the net equilibrium magnetization (macroscopic magnetization) is parallel to \n\n0\nB (figure 2.1a). The difference in energy between the two spin states increases as the \n\nmagnetic field strength increases. \n\n \n\nBesides the static \n0\n\nB  field applied along z, we apply a time varying field \n1\n\nB , \n\nperpendicularly to \n0\n\nB  and oscillating at 0? , which perturbs the populations of the spin-up \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n\nand spin-down states and gives phase coherence to the spins. A 90\u00ba pulse (\n1\n\nB  along the x \n\naxis) brings the magnetisation vector to the xy plane (figure 2.2b). In this case, the \n\nmagnetisation precesses about \n0\n\nB  at \n0\n\n?\n \nand \n\n1\nB\n\n \nat \n\n1\n? . At this point, it is appropriate to \n\nintroduce a new frame of reference for viewing the evolution of the magnetisation  vector, \n\nthe rotating frame (x',y',z) rotating about the z-axis at frequency \n0\n\n? . In the rotating frame \n\nthe magnetisation precesses about the x' axis with frequency \n11\n\nB?? ?  (figure 2.3c). \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2.1. a) Precession of the spins in a static the external magnetic field \n\nand equilibrium magnitisation b) Precession of the net magnitisation in the \n\nlaboratory frame under the influence of the static \n0\n\nB  field and the RF field \n1\n\nB , \n\nc) Net magnitisation viewed in the rotating frame after a on-resonance 90\u00ba (x) \n\npulse.\n3,4\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn MRI the unpaired nuclear spins (mainly from hydrogen atoms in water - 70% to \n\n90% of most tissues - and organic compounds) align themselves when exposed to a \n\nmagnetic field. A temporary radiofrequency pulse at the Larmor frequency changes the \n\nalignment of the spins, and their return to thermal equilibrium (relaxation) is detected in a \n\ncoil. Protons from different tissues react differently giving a picture of anatomical \n\nstructures.\n5\n \n\nc)c)\n\nB\n0\n\nB\n0\n\na)a)a)\n\nb)\n\nB\n0\n\nB1\n\n,\n\n,\n\nc)c)\n\nB\n0\n\nB\n0\n\na)a)a)\n\nB\n0\n\nB\n0\n\nB\n0\n\na)a)a)\n\nb)\n\nB\n0\n\nB1\n\n,\n\n,\n\n\n\n 19 \n\nIn order to create a MRI image of a patient it is necessary to create different voxels \n\n(volume picture elements) of its volume. This is accomplished by applying perpendicular \n\nmagnetic gradients. MRI allows a complete and flexible image orientation; although \n\nnormally in clinical use the reference employed for the magnetic gradient is the principal \n\naxis of the patient (patient\u2019s images are obtained in the x and y axis while the z axis is the \n\nhead to toe direction). These gradients are small perturbations superimposed on the main \n\nmagnetic field \n0\n\nB , with a typical imaging gradient producing a total field variation of less \n\nthan 1%. Therefore, in the presence of a field gradient, each proton will resonate at a \n\nunique frequency that depends on its exact position within the gradient field. The spatial \n\nencoding is obtained by applying magnetic field gradients which encode the position within \n\nthe phase of the signal. \n\nIn the case of one dimension, a linear relationship of phase with respect to position \n\ncan be obtained via collection of data in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. In the \n\ncase of three dimensions (3D), a plane can be defined by \"slice selection\" where a RF \n\npulse of defined bandwidth is applied in the presence of a magnetic field gradient (Figure \n\n2.2). This procedure is applied in order to reduce spatial encoding to two dimensions (2D). \n\nFigure 2.2 is an illustration of slice selection during the RF excitation phase using a \n\nlongitudinal magnetic field gradient. The typical medical resolution is about 1\n3\n\nmm , while \n\nresearch models can exceed 1\n3\n\nm? .6 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2. Illustration of slice selection during the RF excitation phase using \n\na longitudinal magnetic field gradient\n5\n \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n20 \n\n \n\nAlthough the most common sequence is a spin-echo sequence, there are numerous \n\npulse sequence types. The spin-echo sequence (Figure 2.3) consists on the application of \n\na 90\u00ba pulse to the spin system. This 90\u00ba pulse rotates the magnetization to the x\u2019y\u2019 plane, \n\nwhere the transverse magnetization begins to diphase. Following the 90\u00ba pulse a 180\u00ba \n\nrephasing pulse at TE/2 is applied. This pulse rotates the magnetization by 180\u00ba about the \n\nx\u2019 axis, forcing the magnetization to at least partially rephase and generating a signal \n\ncalled a spin echo. In terms of time this is an echo time (TE). \n\nThis pulse sequence is repeated at each time interval TR (Repetition Time). With \n\neach repetition a k-space line acquisition (often refers to the temporary image space, \n\nusually a matrix, in which data from digitized MR signals are stored during data acquisiton) \n\nis filled due to a different phase encoding. Three types of gradients are applied: slice \n\nselection (GS), phase encoding (GP) and frequency encoding (GF). \n\n \n\nOne of the advantages of using a spin-echo sequence is that it introduces \n2\n\nT  (see \n\n2.2.1 for definition) dependence to the signal intensity, since some tissues and \n\npathologies have similar \n1\n\nT  values but different \n2\n\nT  values. It is, thus, of interest to have an \n\nimaging sequence that can produce images with \n2\n\nT  dependence (since the 180\u00ba \n\nrephasing pulse compensates for the constant field heterogeneities to obtain an echo that \n\nis weighted in \n2\n\nT  and not in \n*\n\n2\nT ). The pulse sequence timing can be adjusted to give \n\n1\nT -\n\nweighted proton or spin density and \n2\n\nT -weighted images. This sequence also provides a \n\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio.  \n\n \n\nA spin-echo sequence has two essential parameters: repetition time (TR) and echo \n\ntime (TE), in which TR is defined as the time between repetitions of the sequence and TE \n\nis the time between the 90\u00ba pulse and the maximum amplitude in the echo, respectively. \n\nThis sequence has a clear contrast mechanism for a \n1\n\nT -weighted image, where a short \n\nTR (450 \u2013 850 ms) and TE (10 \u2013 30 ms) are used. In the case of a \n2\n\nT -weighted image a \n\nlong TR (>2000 ms) and TE (>60 ms) are used. In the case of \n1\nH images a long TR with a \n\nshort TE are used.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 21 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3. Spin-echo pulse sequence used in MRI.\n7\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe signal intensity (SI) is given by Eq. 2.1, where k is a proportionality constant \n\ndependent on flow, perfusion and diffusion, and ? is the density of spins in the sample. \n\n \n\n? ? 2/1/1 TTETTR eekSI ???? ?  (2.1) \n\n \n\nThree types of spin echo sequences are commonly used: standard single echo, \n\nstandard multi-echo, and echo-train spin echo. Standard single-echo sequences are \n\ngenerally used to produce \n1\n\nT -weighted images when acquired with relatively short TR and \n\nTE (less than 700 ms and 30 ms, respectively). A multi-slice loop structure is used with a \n\nsingle pair of excitation and refocusing pulses applied per slice loop. The pixel intensity is \n\nproportional to the number of protons contained within the voxel weighted by the \n1\n\nT  and \n\n2\nT  relaxation times for the tissues within the voxel. The echo-train spin echo sequence is \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n22 \n\nsimilar to the multi-echo sequences, except that each spin echo is acquired with a \n\ndifferent phase encoding as well as its own TE. The echo-train length (or turbo factor) is \n\nthe number of echoes acquired in each TR period. Here, k-space is filled segmentally with \n\none echo from each echo-train filling each segment of k-space and, as such, is an efficient \n\nsequence. These sequences are typically used to create \n2\n\nT -weighted images. \n\nNevertheless, at times insufficient contrast is observed and the administration of \n\nContrast Agents (CAs) or Contrast Media is necessary. MRI CAs are able to change the \n\n1\nH relaxation properties of the tissues, leading to MR images with improved contrast. In \n\nMRI the object or patient is exposed to a powerful magnetic field. The hydrogen protons of \n\nthe water molecules in the object or body are excited by radio-frequency pulses. During \n\nthe time they are \u201crecovering\u201d (or relaxing back) they transmit signals that are recorded \n\nand compiled into an image. The faster the atomic nuclei return from an excited to an \n\nunexcited state, the stronger the signal and thus also the contrast. Most approved MRI \n\ncontrast agents are based on the rare earth element gadolinium, adding paramagnetic \n\nproperties to the compound. This element causes the atomic nuclei to relax more quickly \n\nand thus to transmit stronger signals.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2. MRI CONTRAST AGENTS  \n\n \n\nOne of the strengths of MRI is the significant amount of intrinsic contrast between \n\ntissues. This contrast is due to differences in the longitudinal (\n1\n\nT ) and/or transverse (\n2\n\nT ) \n\nproton relaxation times of the tissues under observation accentuated by the chosen TR \n\nand TE. Pathologic tissue may or may not exhibit significant differences in \n1\n\nT  or \n2\n\nT  \n\nrelatively to the surrounding normal tissue. For this reason, there may be little signal \n\ndifference between normal and pathologic tissue in spite of the inherent high contrast in \n\nthe images. An example of difference between a \n1\n\nT  and \n2\n\nT -weighted image is given in \n\nFigure 2.4a and b. \n\n \n\n\n\n 23 \n\na b\n\nc d\n\na b\n\nc d\n\n \n\nFigure 2.4.

This can be achieved by using paramagnetic substances. \n\nExamples of these achievements are the experiments of Bloch et al.\n9\n and Lauterbur et \n\nal.\n10\n\n \n\nThe MRI contrast mechanism can be affected by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors \n\nsuch as proton density and MRI pulse sequences. Based on their relaxation processes the \n\ncontrast agents can be classified as \n1\n\nT  or \n2\n\nT  contrast agents. The commercially approved \n\n1\nT  contrast agents are usually paramagnetic complexes, while the \n\n2\nT  contrast agents are \n\nbased on iron oxide nanoparticles, which are the most representative nanoparticulate \n\nagents. \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n\nThe most common paramagnetic complexes are the paramagnetic chelates \n\ncontaining a lanthanide ion. Currently, gadolinium (III) complexes are by far the most \n\nwidely used CAs in clinical practice because it has seven unpaired electrons making it the \n\nmost paramagnetic (highest spin density) stable metal ion. Gadolinium (III) also has \n\nanother significant feature due to the symmetrical \n8\nS ground state: its electron spin \n\nrelaxation is relatively slow, which is relevant to its efficiency as an MRI CA. There are a \n\nnumber of excellent reviews\n11-18\n\n covering the development and properties of first and \n\nsecond-generation contrast agents, particularly focusing on gadolinium complexes.      \n \n\n11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.1. RELAXATION \n\n \n\nRelaxation is a fundamental precess in MR and presents the main mechanism for \n\nthe image contrast. The RF pulse turns the macroscopic magnetization away from the z-\n\naxis. Once the \n1\n\nB -field has been turned off the magnetization rotate around the main \n\nmagnetic field (\n0\n\nB ) at the Lamor frequency. Due to relaxation processes, the \n\nmagnetization will eventually return to its equilibrium position along the z-axis and the \n\nNMR signal will as a result fade away. There are two different relaxation pathways \n\npossible: the spin-lattice relaxation and the spin-spin relaxation.  \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.1.1. SPIN-LATTICE RELAXATION \n\n \n\nThe spin-lattice relaxation, or longitudinal relaxation, or \n1\n\nT  relaxation, is responsible \n\nfor the return of the z-magnetization component, \nZ\n\nM , to its equilibrium value. It provides \n\nthe mechanism by which the protons give up their energy and return to the thermal \n\nequilibrium. Therefore, if a 90\u00b0 pulse at the resonant frequency,\n0\n\n? , is applied to a sample \n\nits magnetization, \n0\n\nM , will rotate to the x\u2019y\u2019 plane as shown in Figure 2.4-a, and \nZ\n\nM\n \nwill \n\nbe zero. With time, \nZ\n\nM\n \nwill increase, as the protons release their energy (Figure 2.4-b). \n\nThis return of magnetization to equilibrium follows an exponential growth process, with a \n\ntime constant \n1\n\nT  describing the rate of growth (equation 2.2): \n\n \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n? ?)/(\n0\n\n11)(\nT\n\neMM\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n??  (2.2) \n\n \n\nwhere ?  is the time following the RF pulse. After three \n1\n\nT  time periods, M  will have \n\nreturned to 95% of its value prior to the excitation pulse, \n0\n\nM . The term spin-lattice refers \n\nto the fact that the excited proton (\u201cspin\u201d) transfers its energy to its surroundings (\u201clattice\u201d) \n\nrather than to another spin, where the energy will no longer contribute to spin excitation. \n\nThis energy transfer to the surroundings has some very important consequences. The key \n\nto this energy transfer is the presence of some type of molecular motion (e.g., vibration, \n\nrotation) in the vicinity of the excited proton with an intrinsic frequency, \nL\n\n? , that matches \n\nthe resonant frequency, \n0\n\n? . The closer \n0\n\n?\n \nis to \n\nL\n? , the more willingly the motion absorbs \n\nthe energy and the more frequently this energy transfer occurs, allowing the protons to \n\nreturn to equilibrium. \n\n \n\na) b)a) b)a) b)\n\nFigure 2.4. a) Effect of a 90\u00ba RF pulse on the net magnetization, viewed in the \n\nrotating frame. b) Plot of the relative \nZ\n\nM  component as a function of time \n\nafter the RF pulse, know as the \n1\n\nT  relaxation curve. \n\n \n\nIn general any mechanism which gives rise to fluctuating magnetic fields is a \n\npossible relaxation mechanism. Therefore all mechanisms contribute to the observable \n\nrelaxation time according equation 2.3. \n\n \n\n??\nm m\n\nTT\n11\n\n11\n (2.3) \n\n \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n26 \n\nwhere \nm\n\nT\n1\n\n is the time constant of mechanism m . The magnitude of the contribution to the \n\noverall relaxation rate from a single mechanism may differ greatly among different \n\nchemical groups, the chemical environment and has a dependence regarding parameters \n\nsuch as temperature and field strength. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.1.2. SPIN-SPIN RELAXATION \n\n \n\nSpin\u2013spin relaxation time or transverse relaxation time or the relaxation time \n2\n\nT  is \n\nthe time required for the transverse component of M  to decay to 37% of its initial value \n\nvia irreversible processes. The net magnetization \n0\n\nM  is initially along the z-axis (\n0\n\nB ). If a \n\n90\u00b0 pulse is applied to a sample, \n0\n\nM  will rotate as shown in Figure 2.5a-1. This causes \n\n0\nM  to rotate entirely into the x\u2019y\u2019 plane, so that the individual spin magnetic moments \n\nhave phase coherence in the transverse plane at the end of the pulse. With time this \n\nphase coherence disappears and the value of M  in the x\u2019y\u2019 plane decreases toward 0. \n2\n\nT  \n\nor \n*\n\n2\nT  relaxation is the process by which this transverse magnetization is lost. At the end \n\nof the 90\u00b0 RF pulse, when the proton spins have absorbed energy and are oriented in the \n\ntransverse plane, all spins precess at the same frequency \n0\n\n?  and are synchronized at the \n\nsame point or phase of its precessional cycle. Given that a nearby proton of the same type \n\nwill have the same molecular environment, and the same \n0\n\n? , it can easily absorb the \n\nenergy that is being released by its neighbour. Therefore the spin\u2013spin relaxation refers to \n\nthis energy transfer from an excited proton to another nearby proton and the absorbed \n\nenergy remains as spin excitation rather than being transferred to the surroundings as in \n\n1\nT  relaxation. Figure 2.5a illustrates a rotating frame slower than \n\n0\n?  and the various steps \n\nof the net magnetization after a 90\u00ba RF pulse, where:  \n\n1- Net magnetization M is oriented parallel to \n0\n\nB ,  \n\n2- following a 90\u00b0 RF pulse the protons initially precess in phase in the transverse \n\nplane, \n\n3- due to inter- and intramolecular interactions the protons begin to precess at \n\ndifferent frequencies and become asynchronous with each other \n\n4 and 5- as more time elapses the transverse coherence becomes smaller until,  \n\n6- there is complete randomness of the transverse components and no coherence. \n\n\n\n 27 \n\na) b)a) b)a) b)\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5. a) Illustration of the net magnetization M with regards to the x\u2019y\u2019 \n\nplane within a rotating frame slower than \n0\n\n? .  b) Plot of the relative \nXY\n\nM  \n\ncomponent as a function of time, known as the \n2\n\nT  relaxation curve. \n\n \n\nIf the protons continue in close proximity and remain at the same \n0\n\n?  the proton\u2013\n\nproton energy transfer will occur many times. The local magnetic field of the protons can \n\nfluctuate due to intermolecular and intramolecular interactions such as vibrations or \n\nrotations. This fluctuation produces a gradual, irreversible loss of phase coherence of the \n\nspins as they exchange energy and reduce the magnitude of the transverse magnetization \n\nas well as reduce the generated signal (Figure 2.5b). With the increase in time this \n\ntransverse coherence completely disappears, only to reform in the longitudinal direction as \n\n1\nT  relaxation occurs. \n\nThere are two main causes for a loss of transverse coherence to M . The first cause \n\nis the movement of the adjacent spins due to molecular vibrations or rotations \n\n(responsible for spin\u2013spin relaxation or the true \n2\n\nT ). The second cause is due to the \n\ninhomogeneity of the magnetic field. As the proton spin precesses it experiences a \n\nfluctuating local magnetic field, causing a change in \n0\n\n?  and a loss in transverse phase \n\ncoherence. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe proper design of the pulse sequence can eliminate the imaging gradients as a \n\nsource of dephasing. While, the other sources contribute to the total transverse relaxation \n\ntime, \n*\n\n2\nT  equation 2.4: \n\n \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n28 \n\nMSM\nTTTT\n\n222\n\n*\n\n2\n\n1111\n???

For most tissues or liquids, \nM\n\nT\n2\n\n is the major factor in determining \n*\n\n2\nT , \n\nwhereas for tissue with significant iron deposits or air filled cavities, \nMS\n\nT\n2\n\n dominates \n*\n\n2\nT  \n\n(\n2\n\nT  determined using the spin-echo experiment). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2.2. RELAXIVITY \n\n \n\nRelaxivity is the ability of magnetic compounds in enhancing the relaxation rate of \n\nthe surrounding water proton spins. Therefore, the longitudinal and transverse relaxivity \n\nvalues, \n1\nr  and \n\n2\nr , refer to the amount of increase in \n\n1\n1 T and \n\n2\n1 T , respectively, per \n\nmillimolar concentration of agent (often given as per mM of Gd). \n1\n\nT  agents usually have \n\n12\nrr ratios of 1-2, whereas \n\n2\nT  agents normally have \n\n12\nrr ratios ~10 or higher.\n\n 19-23    \n\n19,20,21,22,23\n \n\nSolomon, Bloembergen and Morgan developed the general theory of solvent nuclear \n\nrelaxation in the presence of paramagnetic substances.\n19-23\n\n. The Gd (III) complexes \n\ninduce an increase of both the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates, \n1\n\n1 T and \n2\n\n1 T , \n\nrespectively, of the solvent nuclei (normally water). Diamagnetic and paramagnetic \n\nrelaxation rates are additive and given by equation 2.6: \n\n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\n? ?2,1\n,,,\n\n        , \n111\n\n?\n??\n\ni\n\npidiobsi\nTTT\n\n (2.6) \n\n \n\n? ? ? ?2,1\n,,\n\n        , \n11\n\n?\n??\n\nii\n\ndiobsi\n\nGdr\nTT\n\n (2.7) \n\n \n\nwhere \no b si\n\nT\n,\n\n1\n is the observed solvent relaxation rate, \n\ndi\nT\n\n,\n\n1\nthe diamagnetic relaxation \n\nrate, and 1/Ti,p the paramagnetic relaxation rate that depends on the concentration of \n\nparamagnetic species expressed in millimolar for diluted samples.

(2.25) \n\n \n\nIn the case of small-sized Gd\n3+\n\n complexes the outer sphere contribution is \n\nresponsible for about 50% of the total relaxivity. For macromolecular systems, the outer \n\nsphere contribution may be considered less important. Complexes of similar shape and \n\nsize have similar diffusion coefficients and outer sphere contribution to the relaxivity. \n\n \n\nThe second sphere water molecules should be considered as bound via hydrogen \n\nbonds to the functional group in the ligand molecule. The second-sphere contribution is \n\ndifficult to evaluate due to the number of second-sphere water molecules and their \n\nexchange rates, which are unknown. Usually, the second sphere effect is included in the \n\nouter-sphere contribution. The explanation of unexpected high relaxivity of some Gd\n3+\n\n \n\ncomplexes, such as [Gd(DOTP)]\n7\n where no water molecules can be found in the inner-\n\nsphere, is given by a very strong second-sphere contribution.\n35\n\n \n\n \n\nIt is problematic to separate the inner-, second- and outer-sphere components of \n\nCA\nT\n\n1\n. An approach often used to approximate \n\nIS\nT\n\n1\n of a CA is to simply remove \n\nCA\nT\n\n1\n of a \n\nsecond sphere component, related CA that has 0?q . In the case of the second CA, \nIS\n\nT\n1\n\n \n\nis zero (since 0?q ) and the observed relaxation enhancement is attributed solely to \nSS\n\nT\n1\n\n \n\nand \nOS\n\nT\n1\n\n, therefore providing a reasonable estimate of \nSS\n\nT\n1\n\n and \nOS\n\nT\n1\n\n for the first CA \n\nbecause these parameters are not expected to differ significantly among structurally \n\nrelated CAs. Nevertheless, there are noteworthy exceptions to this assumption and this \n\napproach must be carefully applied.

The relation between the molecular structure \n\nand electronic relaxation is still not well established. This task is focused on the \n\noptimization of three parameters, which are the number of water molecules coordinated to \n\nthe metal ion ( q ), the exchange lifetime (\nM\n\n? ) and the reorientation correlation time (\nR\n\n? ). \n\nAn example of the variation of \nCA\n\nT\n1\n\n with respect to these three parameters is given in \n\nFigure 2.7.

Several important conclusions may be drawn from these simulated \n\ncurves: i) the optimal relaxivities are obtained by slowing down the rotation of the complex \n\nand optimizing the exchange lifetime (for the later, an extreme exchange lifetime has a \n\nnegative influence on the relaxivity); ii) the optimal relaxivity decreases with increasing \n\nmagnetic field strength; iii) when one parameter begins to be optimized the other \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n\nparameters become more critical and, therefore a compromise has to be reached; and iv) \n\ne\nT\n\n1\n increases as the magnetic field strength increases and at 0.5 T, \n\ne\nT\n\n1\n may be a limiting \n\nfactor, while at 1.5 T it may reach a point where it does not influence \n1\nr .  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7.

An important result from the outer-sphere theory is that the \n12\nrr  ratio \n\nincreases with increasing particle size and, thus, smaller particles are much better \n1\n\nT -\n\nshortening agents than larger ones.\n32,38,39\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 39 \n\n2.2.3. NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE DISPERSION \n\n \n\nThe nuclear magnetic relaxation properties of a compound are ideally acquired \n\nby a magnetic field dependence study. This is performed by measuring the proton \n\nlongitudinal and transverse relaxation over a range of magnetic fields with a Fast-Field-\n\nCycling (FFC) spectrometer that switches the magnetic field strength over a range of \n\nproton Larmor frequencies. The data acquired represents the Nuclear Magnetic \n\nResonance Dispersion (NMRD) profile, which can be fitted by eqs 2.10-2.18, eqs 2.21-\n\n2.22 and eqs 2.23-2.24, in order to obtain the values of the relaxation parameters. The \n\nunderlying complexity is a major drawback to this technique, since there are too many \n\ninfluencing parameters inducing possible errors in the fitting of the NMRD profile. For this \n\nreason,\n40\n\n an accurate interpretation of NMRD profiles may only be made by reference to \n\nindependent information from other techniques, such as \n17\n\nO NMR, \n2\nH or \n\n13\nC NMR and \n\nElectron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR). The \n17\n\nO NMR relaxation rates and chemical \n\nshifts, over a range of magnetic fields and as function of temperature and pressure, allow \n\nestimates of the number of inner-sphere water molecules ( q ), the rotational correlation \n\ntime (\nR\n\n? ), the water exchange rate (\nM\n\n? ), and the longitudinal electronic relaxation rate. \n\nWith \n2\nH or \n\n13\nC NMR it is also possible to determine the rotational correlation time (\n\nR\n? ), \n\nwhile the EPR line widths give direct access to transverse electronic relaxation rates.\n30\n\n \n\nWith these techniques a more reliable determination of the set of parameters \n\ngoverning proton relaxivity provide a more stringent test of the relaxation theories applied \n\nto the techniques and allow a validation of current models for the dynamics in \n\nparamagnetic solutions. \n\nWithin a NMRD profile, despite possible inaccuracies, it is viable to draw some \n\nvaluable conclusions concerning the relaxation processes: i) at the high magnetic field \n\nregion (10-100 MHz) the inner-sphere relaxation is governed by the reorientational \n\ncorrelation (\nR\n\n? ) time, which is dependent on the molecular weight of the complexes; ii) at \n\nthe low magnetic field, this region is mainly determined by the zero-field electronic \n\nrelaxation time (\n0s\n\n? ), where \nv\n\ns\n?\n\n?\n20\n\n12\n\n1\n\n?\n?   and is dependent on the symmetry of the \n\ncomplex and on the chemical nature of the coordinating groups. \n\nAn example of a typical NMRD profile of low-molecular-weight Gd(III) complexes \n\nwith one inner-sphere water molecule such as [Gd(DTPA-BMA)(H2O)], [Gd(DTPA)(H2O)]\n2-\n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n\n, or Gd(DOTA)(H2O)]\n-\n (three clinically approved CAs) have the general forms shown in \n\nFigure 2.8. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8. NMRD profile of three commercially-available CAs [Gd(DTPA-\n\nBMA)(H2O)], [Gd(DTPA)(H2O)]\n2-\n, or Gd(DOTA)(H2O)]\n\n-\n.\n14\n\n \n\n \n\nThe main feature of these profiles is that the relaxivity is limited by fast rotation, \n\nespecially at high frequencies (>10 MHz). As a consequence, the high-field relaxivities of \n\nthese three agents are practically the same, since their sizes and therefore their rotational \n\ncorrelation times (\nR\n\n? ) are very similar. The lower value for the water exchange rate (one-\n\norder of magnitude) determined for [Gd(DTPA-BMA)(H2O)] has no influence on the high-\n\nfield relaxivities, since at these fields the relaxivity is exclusively limited by the rotation of \n\nthe CA. In the low-field region the different relaxivities reflect the extremely slower \n\nelectronic relaxation of the symmetric [Gd(DOTA)(H2O)]\n-\n species, as compared to the \n\nlinear chelates. The higher relaxivity is a consequence of its much longer zero-field \n\nelectronic relaxation time (\n0s\n\n? ). The determined \n0s\n\n?  values are 650ps for \n\n[Gd(DOTA)(H2O)]\n-\n \n41\n\n and 72 and 81ps for [Gd(DTPA)(H2O)]\n2-\n\n and [Gd(DTPA-BMA)(H2O)], \n\nrespectively.\n41\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the case of superparamagnetic NPs the relaxation induced by these crystals is \n\ncomplicated by another feature. The ferromagnetic crystals are dispersed in a liquid media \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nto form a colloid suspension. As their size is much smaller than the size of one magnetic \n\ndomain, they are completely magnetized, constituting a nanomagnet made of a fully \n\nmagnetized single domain. In addition to the value of its magnetization, each single mono -\n\ndomain is also characterized by its anisotropy energy. The magnetic energy of each nano-\n\nmagnet depends upon the direction of its magnetization vector with respect to the \n\ncrystallographic directions, increasing with the tilt angle between the magnetization vector \n\nand the anisotropy directions (or easy axes) which minimize this magnetic energy. The \n\ndifference between the maximum and minimum energy is called the anisotropy energy, Ea, \n\nwhich is proportional to the crystal volume (V), Ea = Ka V, where Ka is the anisotropy \n\nconstant.  \n\nIn these conditions, the return of the magnetization to equilibrium is determined \n\nby two different processes. The first one is the N\u00e9el relaxation, which is determined by the \n\nanisotropy energy, and is characterized by a relaxation time constant ?N, which defines the \n\nfluctuations that arise from the jumps of the magnetic moment between different easy \n\ndirections causing the return of the magnetization to equilibrium after a perturbation \n\n(Figure 2.9). The second process is the Brownian relaxation, which characterizes the \n\nviscous rotation of the entire particle, is characterized by a (Figure 2.9).\n36\n\n Therefore, the \n\nglobal magnetic relaxation rate of the colloid (1/?, where ? is the global magnetic relaxation \n\ntime) is the sum of the N\u00e9el relaxation rate (1/??N) and the Brownian relaxation rate (?B). \n\nThe Brownian relaxation time is proportional to the crystal volume while the N\u00e9el \n\nrelaxation time is an exponential function of the volume. Then, in the case of larger \n\nparticles, ?B is shorter then ?N, so the viscous rotation of the particle becomes the \n\ndominant process determining the global relaxation. In these conditions, the magnetization \n\ncurve is perfectly reversible because the fast magnetic relaxation allows the system to be \n\nalways at thermodynamic equilibrium. This behavior has been named \n\n\u201csuperparamagnetism\u201d by Bean and Livingston.\n36\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n42 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9. Illustration of the two components of the magnetic relaxation of a \n\nmagnetic fluid.\n36\n\n \n\n \n\nTherefore, the influence of the electron magnetic moment is modulated by the \n\nN\u00e9el relaxation, which depends upon the crystal anisotropy. In the case of large \n\nsuperparamagnetic crystals or crystals with a very high anisotropy constant\n42\n\n the \n\nanisotropy energy is larger than the thermal energy, maintaining the direction of the crystal \n\nmagnetic moment very close to that of the anisotropy axes. This characteristic simplifies \n\nthe models, enabling the precession of the electron magnetization. Considering small \n\ncrystals, the anisotropy energy is of the same order of magnitude as the thermal energy, \n\ntherefore it is possible for the magnetic moment to point in a different direction from the \n\nanisotropy axes, allowing some electron precession.  \n\nIn both these cases the explanation of the longitudinal relaxation rate \n\ndependence with the magnetic field (NMRD profile) is based on the so-called Curie \n\nrelaxation.\n27\n\n This relaxation arises from considering separately two contributions to \n\nrelaxation: i) diffusion into the inhomogeneous non-fluctuating magnetic field created by \n\nthe mean crystal moment, aligned onto \n0\n\nB  (the accurately termed Curie relaxation) and ii) \n\nthe fluctuations of the electronic magnetic moment or the N\u00e9el relaxation. \n\nThe different contributions to proton relaxation, in the simplified model for crystals \n\nwith large anisotropy, are given in Figure 2.10. As shown at low field, the proton \n\nlongitudinal relaxation rate is obtained by introducing into the Freed equations the \n\nprecession prohibition mentioned above (the electron Larmor precession frequency is set \n\nto zero).\n43\n\n Figure 2.10 shows the dispersion of this density spectral function, called Freed \n\nfunction, centred around \nC\n\nI\n?\n\n?\n1\n\n? . At high field strength the magnetic vector is locked \n\n\n\n 43 \n\nalong the \n0\n\nB  direction and the Curie relaxation dominates and the corresponding \n\nrelaxation rates are given by Ayant\u2019s model.\n44\n\n In the case of intermediate field strength, \n\nthe proton relaxation rates (\n1\n\nR  and \n2\n\nR ) are combinations of the high- and low-field \n\nstrength contributions, weighed by factors depending upon the Langevin function.\n45\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10. Different contributions to proton relaxation in the simplified model \n\nfor crystals with large anisotropy. \n\n \n\nIn the case of superparamagnetic nanoparticles, the fitting of the NMRD profiles \n\nby adequate theories provides information on: their average radius ( r ), their specific \n\nmagnetization (\ns\n\nM ),anisotropy energy (\nA\n\nE ), and N\u00e9el relaxation time (\nN\n\n? ).46 Figure 2.11 \n\nillustrates a standard NMRD profile of magnetite particles in colloidal suspension. The \n\naverage radius ( r ) may be determined since at high magnetic fields the relaxation rate \n\nonly depends upon \nD\n\n?  as the inflection point corresponds to the condition 1~\nDI\n??  (see \n\nFigure 2.11) and given that \nD\n\nr\nD\n\n2\n\n?? , the determination of \nD\n\n?  gives the crystal size r . \n\nRegarding the specific magnetization (\ns\n\nM ), also at high fields, \ns\n\nM  can be obtained from \n\nthe equation: \n\n2/1\n\nmax~ ?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\nD\n\ns\nC\n\nR\nM\n\n?\n, where C  is a constant and \n\nmax\nR  is the maximal relaxation \n\nrate. The absence or presence of dispersion at low fields provides information about the \n\nmagnitude of the anisotropy energy. In the case of crystals characterized by a high \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n\nanisotropy energy (\nA\n\nE ) value as compared to the thermal agitation the low field \n\ndispersion disappears. These conclusions have also been confirmed in previous work with \n\ncobalt ferrites,\n39\n\n which are known to have high anisotropy energy. The relaxation rate at \n\nvery low fields \n0\n\nR  is governed by a \u201czero magnetic field\u201d correlation time \n0C\n\n? , which is \n\nequal to \nN\n\n?  if \nDN\n?? ?? . Often this situation is not met; therefore, \n\nN\n?  is often reported as \n\nqualitative information in addition to the crystal size and the specific magnetization. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11.

CLASSIFICATION OF CAs \n\n \n\nAccording to their various features, the currently available MR CAs may be \n\nclassified in different ways, based on the: i) presence and nature of the metal centre, ii) \n\ntheir magnetic properties, iii) effect on the magnetic resonance image (MRI), iv) chemical \n\nstructure and ligands present, and v) biodistribution and applications. A simplification of \n\nthe above classification may be made, since several of these characteristics are closely \n\nrelated: on one side the chemical composition (metal and ligands), the magnetic \n\nproperties and the effects on the MRI image and, on the other side, their applications \n\nresulting from their in vivo bio-distribution. \n\n\n\n 45 \n\n2.3.1. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION, MAGNETIC PROPERTIES AND EFFECTS \n\nON THE MRI IMAGE \n\n \n\nThe chemical nature of MRI CAs varies widely. They can be i) small \n\nmononuclear or polynuclear paramagnetic chelates, ii) metalloporphyins, iii) polymeric or \n\nmacromolecular carriers (covalently or noncovalently labelled with paramagnetic chelates, \n\nsuch as dendrimers or proteins), iv) particulate CAs, v) paramagnetic or \n\nsuperparamagnetic particles, vi) diamagnetic or paramagnetic chemical exchange \n\nsaturation transfer (PARACEST) polymers or chelates, vii) diamagnetic hyperpolarization \n\nprobes, such as \n13\n\nC labelled compounds or ions.\n47\n\n \n\nThe most common and simplest paramagnetic chelates use Gd\n3+\n\n or Mn\n2+\n\n (due to \n\ntheir properties already described) as metal centres with linear or macrocyclic \n\npolyaminocarboxylate/phosphonate derivative ligands. In the case of particulate CAs, Gd\n3+\n\n \n\nions are also used in various forms, for example: bound to amphiphylic chelates in \n\nparamagnetic micelles, in the bilayer of liposomes, as small chelates in their aqueous \n\ninternal compartment, or bound to porous materials like zeolites.\n47\n\n When considering \n\nparamagnetic or superparamagnetic particles, gadolinium oxide nanoparticles and iron \n\noxide particles with different sizes and coatings are considered, respectively.\n 47\n\n  \n\nOther paramagnetic chelates containing different Ln\n3+\n\n ions, such as Dy\n3+\n\n or Tm\n3+\n\n, \n\nare used as MRI CAs with different variations. Examples of these variations are as \n\nsusceptibility agents, when they are in a compartment, affecting T2 or T2\n*\n relaxation,\n\n48\n or \n\nas PARACEST and LIPOCEST agents, where the paramagnetic shift effect of the ion on \n\nthe proton nuclei of the CA facilitates the irradiation of their shifted resonances and \n\nconsequent saturation transfer by chemical exchange (CEST effect), thus decreasing the \n\nwater proton signal intensity and leading to a negative image contrast.\n49\n\n \n\nLess conventional MRI CAs do not contain any metal centre. Examples include \n\nthe oral agents or the CEST agents. \n\nRecently a new class of MRI CAs has been developed, dynamic nuclear \n\npolarization (DNP) agents, such as hyperpolarized noble gases (\n3\nHe, \n\n129\nXe) and \n\n13\nC-\n\nlabeled organic compounds or ions like \n6\nLi\n\n+\n. The probe\u2019s nuclei (with long T1 values) \n\nexhibit a strong signal enhancement allowing the direct imaging of the probe\u2019s molecular \n\ndistribution.\n 47\n\n \n\n \n\nCAs may also be classified according to their magnetic properties as \n\nparamagnetic or superparamagnetic agents. Metal ions with one or more unpaired \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n\nelectrons are paramagnetic and consequently possess a permanent magnetic moment. \n\nOrganic free radicals are also paramagnetic due to their unpaired valence electron. Within \n\nan aqueous suspension a dipolar magnetic interaction between the electronic magnetic \n\nmoment of the paramagnetic atom and the much smaller magnetic moments of the \n\nprotons of the nearby water molecules is formed. Random fluctuations in this dipolar \n\nmagnetic interaction can be caused by the molecular motions, therefore reducing both the \n\nlongitudinal (\n1\n\nT ) and the transverse (\n2\n\nT ) relaxation times of the water protons. As already \n\nmentioned, Gd\n3+\n\n and Mn\n2+\n\n are examples of paramagnetic ions used as MR CAs, because \n\ntheir physical properties are suitable for efficiently reducing the \n1\n\nT  and \n2\n\nT  proton \n\nrelaxation times. \n47\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, paramagnetic metal ions, like Gd\n3+\n\n, can not be used as CAs in \n\ntheir ionic form due to their undesirable biodistribution (accumulating in bones, liver or \n\nspleen) and relatively high toxicity. Therefore, metal ion complexes (chelates) with high \n\nthermodynamic and kinetic stabilities are required in order to use these paramagnetic \n\nmetal ions in vivo. Small Gd\n3+\n\n or Mn\n2+\n\n-based paramagnetic chelates are nonspecific CAs \n\nand have similar \n1\nr  and \n\n2\nr  effects in water. Currently these agents are used mainly for \n\npositive contrast \n1\n\nT -weighed images. As already mentioned, the relaxivity effects of these \n\nagents result mostly from both inner- and outer-sphere mechanisms. \n\nThe superparamagnetic agents consist of materials, such as iron oxides, in the \n\nform of colloids made up of particles (typically 5 \u2013 200nm in diameter) in suspension, \n\nwhich are composed of very small crystallites (1 \u2013 10 nm) containing several thousand \n\nmagnetic ions. These agents exhibit a behaviour similar to paramagnetism except that, \n\ninstead of each individual atom being independently influenced by an external magnetic \n\nfield, the magnetic moment of the entire crystallite tends to align with that magnetic field.\n 47\n\n \n\nTherefore the magnetic moments of the individual ions do not cancel out but are mutually \n\naligned, inducing a much higher permanent magnetic moment within the crystallites when \n\nin the presence of a magnetic field compared to a single molecule of a Gd chelate.\n 47\n\n \n\nThese particles are embedded in a coating such as dextrans (in ferumoxide) or \n\nsiloxanes (in ferumoxsil), which prevents agglomeration. There are three kinds of \n\nparticulate superparamagnetic iron oxides, according to the overall size of the particles: i) \n\nif they have a diameter d<50 nm , they are known as ultra-small superparamagnetic iron \n\noxide (USPIO) particles; ii) if 1 m? >d>50 nm , they are called small superparamagnetic \n\niron oxide (SPIO) particles; and iii) micron-sized particles of iron oxide (MPIO) are large \n\nparticles, with a diameter of several microns. Intravenous administration is only possible \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nfor the former two, while the large particles can only be administered orally to explore the \n\ngastrointestinal tract, otherwise they would be trapped in the lung alveoli. Yet more \n\nnomenclatures exist, such as monocrystalline iron oxide particles (MION) and cross-linked \n\niron oxides (CLIO). \n\n \n\nAs a consequence of their larger size and magnetic moment SPIOs were initially \n\ndeveloped as \n2\n\nT -agents, producing a dark area on MRI images resulting from their \n\nnegative contrast effect.\n50\n\n A new generation of USPIOs with sizes less than 10 nm has \n\nalso been reported to have excellent \n1\n\nT -enhancing properties.\n39,51,52,53\n\n As already \n\nmentioned, the relaxation induced by superparamagnetic particles is explained by the \n\nclassical outer-sphere relaxation theory, reformulated by the Curie relaxation theory.\n48\n\n \n\nThe susceptibility agents induce long-range interactions which can dominate the \n\n2\nT  or \n\n*\n\n2\nT  relaxation. This relaxation mechanism, known as susceptibility-induced \n\nrelaxation,\n 47\n\n is related to the magnetization of the CA, which results from the partial \n\nalignment of the individual magnetic moments in the direction of the magnetic field. \n\n \n\nAn example of this type of agent is when a CA becomes compartmentalized, like \n\nwhen superparamagnetic particles are taken up by Kupffer cells, or in a vessel, the \n\ncompartment containing these CA functions as a secondary CA. In this case the water \n\nprotons on the outside of the compartment are affected by the overall magnetization of the \n\nmagnetic bulk material inside that compartment and are, therefore, relaxed by an outer-\n\nsphere mechanism.\n 47\n\n The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect is due to this long-\n\nrange \n*\n\n22\nTT relaxation effect, where the paramagnetic hemoglobin is compartmentalized \n\nwithin blood erythrocytes. This phenomenon is the basis of functional MRI \n54\n\n and can \n\ndepend on several parameters such as the magnetic moment and local concentration of \n\nthe CA, the dimensions and geometry of the compartment, the diffusion constant of water \n\nwithin the compartment and so on. \n\nAs already mentioned, the classification of MR CAs as \u2018\n1\n\nT  agents\u2019 or \u2018\n2\n\nT  agents\u2019 \n\nis not always accurate, since any CA that reduces \n1\n\nT  also reduces \n2\n\nT . Nevertheless any \n\nagent that reduces \n2\n\nT  does not necessarily reduce \n1\n\nT , at least at MRI field strengths. \n\nTherefore the CA functions as a \u2018\n1\n\nT  agent\u2019 or \u2018\n2\n\nT  agent\u2019 depending on the imaging \n\nsequence used, the magnetic field strength, the size of the CA and how the CA is \n\ncompartmentalized in the tissue. \n47\n\n \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2. BIODISTRIBUTION AND APPLICATIONS \n\n \n\nThe biodistribution of CAs is very important because it is vital to know what \n\nhappens to the CAs and where they go when they are intravenously administered. The \n\nmain distribution sites and excretion pathways for soluble metal complexes are \n\nsummarized in Figure 2.12.  \n\nThere are several types of possible classifications and divisions for CAs such as: \n\ni) non-specific agents, ii) specific or targeted agents, iii) non-injectable organ-specific \n\nagents, iv) responsive, smart or bio-activated agents and v) CEST and Hyperpolarized \n\nagents. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12. Main distribution sites and excretion pathways for intravenously \n\nadministered soluble metal complexes.\n 47\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2.1. NON-SPECIFIC AGENTS  \n\n \n\nNonspecific CAs (those that do not interact specifically with any type of cells) \n\nencompass the extracellular fluid (ECF) agents and the blood pool agents (BPA). The \n\n\n\n 49 \n\nformer are low molecular weight extracellular complexes that equilibrate rapidly between \n\nthe intravascular and interstitial space and are mainly excreted by the kidneys.\n55-58\n\n BPA \n\nhave high molecular weight, such as high generation dendrimers, which stay within the \n\nintravascular space and are slowly excreted via the kidneys and/or the liver.     \n55,56,57,58\n\n \n\nThe ECF agents leak rapidly from the blood into the interstitium with a distribution \n\nhalf-life of about 5 minutes and are cleared by the kidney with an elimination half -life of \n\nabout 80 minutes. ECF agents have been extensively used in extra-cranial applications. \n\nSince these agents rapidly clear out of the blood, the images are typically acquired in the \n\nearly phase following a bolus injection, when used in conjunction with MRA. The most \n\ncommon ECF agents are Gd\n3+\n\n chelates of linear or macrocyclic polyaminocarboxylate \n\nligands and are the main commercially-available MRI CAs. These type of CAs can be \n\ndivided into two groups: neutral and ionic agents (Figure 2.13, Table 2.1). In conclusion, \n\nGd\n3+\n\n-based ECF agents are typically safe when used in clinically recommended doses, \n\nand adverse reactions and side effects, such as allergy, are very rare.\n 47 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13.

These two \n\ncharacteristics offer many advantages in MR angiography (MRA) when compared to ECF \n\nagents.\n14,59\n\n Because their high molecular weight (>20 kDa) prevents leakage into the \n\ninterstitium, they remain in the intravascular system longer than conventional ECF \n\nagents.\n60\n\n These agents have been primarily developed for MRA and there main properties \n\nare to have a relatively long vascular half-life and the highest possible \n1\nr -relaxivity. Their \n\nr2 relaxivity must be low enough to avoid excessive signal loss due to \n*\n\n22\nTT  relaxation.\n\n 47\n \n\n \n\nThe potential advantage of using a BPA in MRA is the prolonged imaging window \n\ngiven that a longer image acquisition time is granted. This translates into a higher image \n\nresolution and/or signal-to-noise ratio, therefore higher-quality angiograms may potentially \n\nbe attained when compared to gadolinium-based ECF agents. In this respect, vascular \n\nabnormalities, associated with certain tumours or atherosclerosis, can be more easily \n\ndetected. Additionally, tissue blood volume and perfusion can be measured.\n61\n\n The \n\ndisadvantage of this \u2018steady-state\u2019 approach is that arteries and veins are equally \n\nenhanced, thus making their differentiation more challenging. \n\n\n\n 51 \n\n \n\nAccording to their action mechanism the BPA can be divided into several \n\nclasses: i) the noncovalent binding of low molecular weight Gd\n3+\n\n -based complexes to \n\nhuman serum albumin \u2013HSA (the most abundant plasma protein) which prevents \n\nimmediate leakage into the intersititial space; ii) systems based on polymers or liposomes \n\n(increases the size of the CA molecule); and iii) systems based on particles (involves a \n\nchange in the route of elimination).

SPECIFIC OR TARGETED AGENTS  \n\n \n\nSpecific or targeted agents can also be divided into two main groups: those that \n\nare actively targeted to a molecularly specific site with an appropriate ligand and those \n\nthat are passively directed to a particular type of cell. The first group includes agents that \n\ntarget pathologic processes or states, such as inflammation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, \n\natherosclerosis and tumour. The cell labelling CAs function through recognition of specific \n\nmolecular markers of those processes at the cell surface (such as cell-specific receptors \n\nor transport proteins) and accumulate at those molecular sites (usually in the intracellular \n\nspace).\n 47 \n\nTherefore, these cell labelling CAs are essential for MRI molecular imaging. The \n\nsecond main group are the organ-specific agents for the liver (hepatobiliary), spleen, \n\nlymph nodes, bone marrow or brain, based mainly on the agent size and/or chemical \n\nstructure. Nevertheless, all CAs can be considered organ-specific CAs to some extent, as \n\nthey are excreted either by the liver or the kidneys.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 53 \n\nActively Targeted or cell labelling Contrast Agents \n\n \n\nThe actively targeted or cell labelling CAs are able to recognize specific \n\nmolecular sites (e.g. cell-specific receptors or transport proteins) at the cellular membrane \n\nand accumulate at those sites. Researchers involved in the synthesis of MRI contrast \n\nagents devote special attention to these types of agents. The development of agents \n\nenables the recognition and imaging of a specific \u2018signature\u2019 of a given disease (molecular \n\nimaging) that simplifies the task of diagnosis and therapy.\n62\n\n One of the requirements for \n\nefficient molecular probes is the development of high affinity ligands and their conjugation \n\nto contrast agents Figure 2.15A. A major problem is the need to have a local \n\nconcentration of CA of ca. 0.5 mM in order to have 50% enhancement of contrast. It is \n\npossible to increase the payload of reporter groups delivered at the target site by using \n\nmanyreporters bound to a single carrier, as illustrated in Figure 2.15B. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15. General structure of a targeted CA for cell labelling a) with a single \n\nreporter group, b) with a carrier of many reporter groups.\n47\n\n \n\n \n\nThe main applied targeting strategies are cell-surface targeting and receptor \n\ntargeting. In the former, specific epitopes easily available at the cell surface are targeted \n\nto which the CA stays bound. This strategy has been used together with the pretargeting \n\napproach in order to facilitate the detection and imaging of tumour cells (as tumour cells \n\nare known to have abnormally high negative charges on their cell surface). It is clear that \n\nA \n\nB \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n54 \n\nthe use of low-molecular-weight targeting CAs that are able to accumulate quickly at \n\nspecific cell surface sites have more advantages with regards to the use of \n\nmacromolecular agents.\n 47\n\n Another example of cell-surface targeting is the well-known \n\nnon-specific binding of porphyrins to the interstitial space of tumours, e.g. Dy-TPPS \n\n(TPPS=tetraphenylporphyrin sulfonate). One expanded porphyrin (texaphyrin) complex, \n\n[Gd(Tex)]\n2+\n\n (PCI-120), selectively accumulates in tumours, inducing a prolonged \n\nenhancement in MRI images and provides the possibility of being used as a radiation \n\nsensitizer for brain cancer.\n63\n\n \n\n \n\nThe targeting of cell-surface receptors approach can be pursued using labelled \n\nantibodies or low-molecular-weight targeting complexes. In the first approach, due to the \n\nslow diffusion of the antibodies, the most accessible targets are those present on the \n\nendothelial vessels.\n 47\n\n A typical example is the targeting of the endothelial integrin receptor \n\n3\n??\n\nV\n, a specific angiogenesis marker whose concentration correlates to the tumour \n\ngrade. An example of an imaging probe containing many reporter groups per carrier is a \n\nGd\n3+\n\n-containing polymerized liposome. The pretargeting approach was used, where the \n\ntarget was bound first to a biotinylated monoclonal antibody against \n3\n\n??\nV\n\n, which is well \n\nrecognized by an avidin moiety present on the liposome surface carrying the Gd\n3+\n\n chelate \n\nreporter groups.\n64\n\n The same \n3\n\n??\nV\n\n target has also been grafted with lipidic nanoparticles \n\ncontaining Gd\n3+\n\n chelates.\n65\n\n The large molecular size and consequently the slow delivery of \n\nthese systems can be considered the major limitation of this technique. \n\n \n\nA more efficient way to accumulate CAs at the target site is by cell internalization. \n\nFor this process to be completely successful the concentration of the agent inside the cell \n\nmust be higher than at the cell surface. The internalization processes may occur via \n\nphagocytosis and pinocytosis (or fluid phase endocytosis) mechanisms, which do not \n\nrequire a cell receptor, or receptor mediated endocytosis.\n 47\n\n Gd-DTPA bis-stearylamide \n\nderivatives are CAs forming insoluble Gd\n3+\n\n-containing particles that are biodegraded after \n\ninternalization and become soluble and trapped inside the cell.\n66\n\n Gd-HPDO3A is a CA \n\nused for labelling stem cells via pinocytosis mechanism where the stem cells are \n\nincubated in a culture medium containing Gd-HPDO3A with a concentration ranging 10\u2013\n\n50mM.\n67\n\n The relaxivity of the CA entrapped in the cell endosomic compartment can be \n\nseriously limited with the exception of the internalization by electroporation, where they \n\nare delivered to the cytoplasm.\n68\n\n Other cell internalization mechanisms have used \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nmembrane transporters and transmembrane carrier peptides. The latter have proven \n\nuseful for the internalization of a number of substrates like proteins, oligonucleotides and \n\nplasmid DNA.  \n\n \n\nAnother interesting development was the synthesis of a bimodal (optical and MR) \n\nimaging probe consisting of a Gd\n3+\n\n/Eu\n3+\n\n-DOTA complex, a PNA (peptide nucleic acid) \n\nsequence and a transmembrane carrier peptide.\n 47\n\n This system can enter any type of cell, \n\nhowever it accumulates only in tumour cells due to the specific binding of the PNA moiety \n\nto the c-myc mRNA whose production is increased in those cells.\n69\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPassively directed - organ-specific agents \n\n \n\nThe passively directed or organ specific CAs are passively directed to a \n\nparticular type of cell. Normally, there are organ-specific agents for the liver \n\n(hepatobiliary), spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow or brain, and they are generally based \n\nmainly on the agent size and/or chemical structure.\n 47\n\n \n\n \n\nIn general, tissue or organ-specific contrast agents consist of two components: a \n\nmagnetic label capable of altering the signal intensity on MR images and a target-group \n\nmolecule having a characteristic affinity for a specific type of cell or receptor. Some \n\nsuitable residues have been incorporated into either the acetic side arms or the \n\ndiethylenetriamine backbone of Gd-DTPA and Gd-DOTA to obtain the tissue or organ-\n\nspecific contrast agents. This type of CAs provides specific advantages in terms of \n\nsensitivity of lesion detection and characterization. Examples of these types of agents are \n\nthe hepatobiliary CAs,\n70-74\n\n the lymph nodes and bone marrow CAs,\n75\n\n the brain CAs\n76-79\n\n \n\nand the gastro-intestinal CAs\n80,81\n\n that can accumulate in the target sites, increasing \n\ncontrast concentration and can produce stronger signal in the MR images.

NON INJECTABLE ORGAN-SPECIFIC AGENTS  \n\n \n\nWhen ingested, non-injectable organ-specific agents (oral agents) change the \n\nsignal intensity at the stomach and the intestine relatively to adjacent abdominal tissues. \n\nDepending on their magnetic properties they may change the contrast of the gastro-\n\nintestinal (GI) tract through various mechanisms, thus allowing MR cholangiography \n\n(Table 2.4). \n\nDiamagnetic agents, such as fatty emulsions, fill the GI tract with materials with \n\nshort \n1\n\nT , enhancing its signal and producing positive contrast relatively to adjacent \n\ntissues. Within the same level, diamagnetic agents can also generate negative contrast \n\neither by decreasing the \n2\n\nT  of GI water protons, such as in the presence of Ba\n2+\n\n, Al\n3+\n\n, \n\nSi\n4+\n\n-containing suspensions, or by decreasing the proton density through the use of \n\n\n\n 57 \n\nperfluorinated compounds like perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB).\n 47\n\n Paramagnetic agents, \n\nsuch as MnCl2 solutions, Magnevist\u00ae [Gd-(DTPA)] or Gadolite\u00ae Gd\n3+\n\n-containing zeolite Y \n\nparticle suspensions,\n80\n\n ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) solutions, are oral positive CAs that \n\ndecrease the \n1\n\nT  of GI water protons.

RESPONSIVE, SMART OR BIOACTIVATED AGENTS \n\n \n\nThe term \u2018responsive\u2019 refers to paramagnetic systems that are sensitive to a \n\ngiven biochemical or physiologic parameter that characterizes their microenvironment. \n\nTypical parameters to which these systems should be responsive are the pH, \n\ntemperature, oxygen pressure, enzymatic activity, redox potential and concentration of a \n\nspecific ion. The use of these agents induces a type of imaging, Molecular Imaging, which \n\naims to noninvasively visualize the expression and function of bioactive molecules that \n\noften represent specific molecular signatures in disease processes. \n48\n\n So far, only very \n\nfew of these CA have progressed to in vivo testing. The in vivo non-invasive detection of \n\nabnormalities in pH or temperature, in the oxygen pressure, in enzymatic activities or in \n\nthe concentration of metal ions and radicals may serve in the future as an important \n\ndiagnostic tool of the underlying diseases. Information on the redox status, an important \n\nfactor governing tumour aggressiveness, can also help determine the adapted tumour \n\ntreatment. Many of these abnormalities are observable in the extracellular media, which \n\nlargely facilitates the chemical design of the imaging probes that have no need for \n\nintracellular CA delivery. \n\n \n\n \n\npH-sensitive agents \n\n \n\nThe potential use of pH-sensitive probes is vast, though so far pH mapping of \n\ntissues has been primarily intended to facilitate cancer detection and assess the tumour \n\nstatus. The pH on the surface of tumours is ~0.4 units lower than that of normal tissue, but \n\nin some cases it can be as low as 6.0.\n82\n\n The pH-sensitive probes may also indicate \n\nneuronal activity because they induce a slight acidification of the extracellular medium (pH \n\n7.2\u20137.4).\n83\n\n One could also imagine the use of pH-responsive probes to determine if the \n\nbrain environment is suitable for a drug that functions in a pH-sensitive environment. \n\n \n\nThe main requirements for a system to be pH-sensitive are that either the \n\ndynamics or structural properties determining its relaxivity are pH-dependent. The pH \n\ndependence of the relaxivity can reflect changes in the hydration number of the metal \n\nchelates and the presence of protonatable groups on the ligands can influence these \n\nchanges.\n36,84 ,85,86,87,88,89\n\n \n\n\n\n 59 \n\nDesigning of pH-sensing probes has become an intensive field in MR imaging \n\ncontrast agent research.\n49,84-89\n\n Some of the pH probes are useful for in vivo application. An \n\nexample is the combination of the pH-sensitive amido-phosphonate derivative of Gd-\n\nDOTA and a pH-insensitive analogue, which were used in a dual injection to image renal \n\npH in mice.\n90,91\n\n The assumption was made that both compounds have comparable \n\npharmacokinetics; hence the concentration of the former can be inferred from the \n\nconcentration of the latter. This mixture has been also used to obtain extracellular pH MR \n\nimaging maps in a rat glioma model, with improved spatial resolution compared with \n\nspectroscopic methods.\n92\n\n Differences in the order of 1 pH unit could be detected; the \n\nabsolute pH values have been calculated by using a calibration method.  \n\n \n\nThe key factor inducing the effectiveness of an agent is the difference between \n\nthe relaxivity of the \"on\" state compared with that of the \"off\" state. Recently the amplitude \n\nof the relaxivity response to pH variation of this low-molecular-weight probe has been \n\nlargely improved (doubled in some cases) by conjugating it to a macromolecular \n\ndendrimeric scaffold.\n93\n\n Improving the relaxivity response to pH by increasing the molecular \n\nweight may also negatively impact the effectiveness of such agents. As already \n\nmentioned, large molecules, such as dendrimers, remain in the vasculature longer than \n\ndiscrete agents, which are better able to diffuse into all extracellular space. Large \n\nmolecules also tend to slowly clear from the body, resulting in increased liver uptake, \n\nextending their retention time in the body. Further studies into the in vivo behaviour of \n\ndendrimer-based MR imaging contrast media will be required to establish whether this \n\napproach, which is successful for increasing the relaxivity response, will yield agents that \n\ncan actually be applied in vivo. \n\n \n\n \n\nTemperature-sensitive agents \n\n \n\n \n\nMost Ln\n3+\n\n chelates have temperature-dependent NMR properties, such as their \n\n1\nH NMR chemical shifts. These shifts can be monitored and used to determine \n\ntemperature variation. For this reason some of these Ln\n3+\n\n chelates are considered to be \n\ngood temperature probes.\n94,95 \n\nThe encapsulation of Gd\n3+\n\n chelates into liposomes is also another example of a \n\ntemperature-dependent probe.\n96\n\n The membrane transition from gel to liquid crystal occurs \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n\nat a specific temperature. At this precise temperature changes in the permeability of the \n\nmembrane occurs, therefore the mobility of the water molecules through the membrane \n\nchanges and consequently the relaxivity also changes.\n 47\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEnzymatic activity agents \n\n \n\nAmong all responsive agents, enzyme targeting represents a specific \n\nadvantage, which is particularly valid for MR imaging detection given its low sensitivity. A \n\nsmall concentration of the enzyme can catalytically convert a relatively high amount of the \n\nenzyme-responsive magnetic probe, which increases the detection for the enzyme \n\ncompared with other biomolecules. In addition, the remarkable specificity of enzymatic \n\nreactions, which can be observed as changes in the MR imaging properties, can be \n\nundoubtedly attributed to the targeted enzyme. The presence of certain enzymatic \n\nreactions indicates the cellular state and can provide the signature of a given pathology. \n\nConsequently the real-time non-invasive in vivo detection of specific enzymatic activities \n\nwould have invaluable diagnostic impact.  \n\n \n\nAs the enzymatic activity has been established in the processes of tumour \n\nformation, growth and metastasis, it is vital to monitor it. Molecular Biology studies have \n\ndefined enzymatic steps of the apoptotic response to anticancer therapies in vitro and in \n\nvivo. Utilising this approach the detection of gene markers (such as ?-galactosidase) could \n\nbe another important field of application.\n 47\n\n \n\n \n\nThe first enzymatically responsive potential MR imaging contrast agent was a \n\nGd-DOTA\u2013derivative bearing a galactopyranose residue that avoids water \n\ncoordination.\n97,98 \n\nThis sugar moiety is a substrate for the enzyme ?-galactosidase. Its \n\nenzymatic cleavage by ?-galactosidase opens the access of water to the first coordination \n\nsphere of Gd\n3+\n\n, resulting in an enhancement of the relaxivity, thus irreversibly activating \n\nthe agent. This agent has been successfully used in vivo to detect by MRI ? -\n\ngalactosidase mRNA expression in living Xenopus laevis embryos.\n 47\n\n \n\n \n\nAmong other examples, Nivorozhkin et al\n99\n\n reported the\n \n\nenzymatic \n\ntransformation of a prodrug Gd\n3+\n\n complex with poor\n \naffinity to HSA and low relaxivity to a \n\n\n\n 61 \n\nspecies with improved\n \nHSA affinity and enhanced relaxivity.\n\n 36 \nMazooz et al\n\n100\n described a \n\nGd-DTPA peptide acting\n \nas a transglutaminase substrate, which was used to monitor \n\ntransglutaminase\n \nactivity.\n\n 47\n Anelli et al\n\n101\n functionalized Gd(DTPA)\n\n2\u2013 \nwith sulfonamide, \n\nwhich is known as a specific carbonic anhydrase\n \ninhibitor. The agent reacts with carbonic \n\nanhydrase and thus\n \ntargets enzyme-rich tissues.\n\n 47\n Shiftan et al\n\n102\n reported MR imaging \n\nvisualization of\n \nhyaluronidase in ovarian carcinoma, related to the aggressiveness\n\n \nof \n\novarian cancer metastasis.\n 47\n\n Chen et al\n103\n\n visualized plaque\n \nrupture in atherosclerosis \n\nwith a Gd-DOTA\u2013serotonin derivative,\n \nwhich polymerizes in the presence of neutrophil \n\nmyeloperoxidase,\n \n\nresulting in a remarkable relaxivity increase. Another concept for \n\nenzyme detection is based on the self-immolative\n \nmechanism.\n\n 47\n Duimstra et al\n\n104\n reported \n\na Gd\n3+\n\n complex with a self-immolative\n \n\nmoiety, designed for the detection of ?-\n\nglucuronidase.\n 47\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRedox potential sensitive agents \n\n \n\nHypoxia is an important factor governing tumour aggressiveness, as hypoxic \n\ntissue is more resistant\n \nto conventional therapeutics. The methodology of imaging tumour \n\nredox status would allow the noninvasive application of\n \nthis potential biomarker of tumour \n\nsensitivity to existing and\n \nnovel chemotherapies, as well as radiation therapy. The \n\npossibility of using such methods could also extend to other pathologies, such\n \nas \n\ncardiovascular disease, since free radical formation is\n \nassociated with damaging effects \n\non the coronary microcirculation\n \nduring recovery from myocardial infarction.\n\n105\n Hypoxia is \n\nmostly detected by imaging techniques including positron-emission\n \ntomography (PET) and \n\nblood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) MR imaging. \n\nReports on redox-sensitive MR\n \nimaging contrast agents have been rather \n\nscarce. The simplest\n \ndesign of a these agents is based on metal complexes whose metal \n\nion can be reduced or\n \noxidized depending on the biologic environment and these \n\n \ntwo \n\noxidation forms have different relaxation properties. As a result,\n \nthe two redox states \n\ninfluence the proton relaxation of the surrounding\n \nprotons to a different extent, resulting in \n\ndifferent image\n \nintensities. \n\nThe partial oxygen pressure (pO2) is also an important parameter in the \n\nmetabolic processes of the cells and its variation is related with certain pathologies.\n 47\n\n The \n\nusual systems used as pO2 probes are based on the redox equilibrium of paramagnetic \n\nions. In these systems the relaxivity depends on the oxidation state of the metal ion and \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n62 \n\nconsequently on the oxygen pressure. It has been reported that the adducts formed \n\nbetween\n \ntpps complexes of Mn (III) and Mn (II) and poly-?-cyclodextrin have considerably \n\ndifferent relaxivities\n \ndepending on the redox state of the metal, itself determined\n\n \nby the \n\npartial oxygen pressure of the solution. This technique can quantify the oxygen \n\nconcentration in the surrounding environment.\n106\n\n \n\nMore recently,\n \nDOTA-based complexes of Gd bearing a thiol moiety were \n\nsynthesized,\n \nand they form reversible\n\n \ncovalent linkages with HSA, which contains a \n\nreactive thiol\n \nat cysteine-34. This redox-sensitive reversible binding of Gd\n\n \ncomplexes to \n\nplasma albumin was exploited for imaging the\n \ntissue-redox state.\n\n107\n \n\n \n\nMetal ion and radical agents \n\n \n\nIt is known that the presence of metal ions can induce changes in the structure \n\nof the paramagnetic complexes, consequently changing their relaxivities.\n 47\n\n Considering \n\nthe Ca\n2+\n\n-sensitive MR imaging probes two different approaches have been attempted. \n\nThe first approach uses Gd-complexes with a \n1\n\nT  response on\n \ninteraction with Ca\n\n2+\n ions, \n\nwhile the second approach uses a \n2\n\nT  agent based on the Ca\n2+\n\n-related\n \naggregation of \n\nsuperparamagnetic iron nanoparticles and calmodulin.\n108\n\n Although these strategies have \n\nseveral limitations, the main drawback of the second approach is the relatively\n \nlong time \n\ncourse of the Ca\n2+\n\n-dependent aggregation (a few seconds) that\n \nprevents the sensing of \n\nfast Ca\n2+\n\n-concentration changes. \n\nThe design of all Gd\n3+\n\n-based Ca\n2+\n\n ion\u2013sensitive\n \n\nprobes reported so far \n\ninvolved changes in the coordination\n \nsphere of the Gd\n\n3+\n ion following coordination of Ca\n\n2+\n. \n\nThese probes\n \nintegrate 2 coordinating units that selectively chelate Gd\n\n3+ \nand Ca\n\n2+\n ions. In \n\nthe absence of the sensed Ca\n2+\n\n ion, one or more of the donor groups of the Ca\n2+\n\n chelating \n\ncentre, are weakly\n \ncoordinated to the Gd\n\n3+\n ion. Concerning the interaction with Ca\n\n2+\n, this\n\n \n\ndonor group switches from Gd\n3+\n\n to Ca\n2+ \n\ncoordination, consequently liberating one \n\ncoordination position on the\n \nGd\n\n3+\n ion. This free coordination position is immediately \n\noccupied by a water molecule increasing the hydration number and the relaxivity. The \n\nwork of Li et al.\n109\n\n is an example of this type of agents utilizing this approach. \n\nZn\n2+\n\n is the second most abundant transition metal ion in the body\n \nand its \n\nhighest concentrations occur in the brain. Hanaoka et al.\n 110\n\n used a ligand of DTPA with \n\nN,N,N\u2019,N\u2019-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TREN) as a zinc specific chelator. In \n\nthe absence of zinc, water is bound to the gadolinium ion. In the presence of zinc, the \n\n\n\n 63 \n\ncarboxylic acid and pyridine moieties coordinate to zinc thus restricting the access of \n\nwater to the Gd\n3+\n\n, thereby decreasing the hydration number and respective relaxivity in \n\nthe presence of zinc.\n 47\n\n \n\nIron is the most abundant transition metal in the body and in\n \nthe brain. Biologic \n\niron is\n \nmost commonly found in the +2 (ferrous) and +3 (ferric) oxidation\n\n \nstates. Aime et \n\nal.\n111\n\n synthesized an iron-sensitive contrast agent by functionalizing DTPA with salicylate \n\nmoieties. In the presence of Fe\n3+\n\n the Gd-DTPA\u2013salicylate complexes bind to the iron ions \n\nvia the salicylate functional groups. The relaxivity increases as this binding yields an \n\nincrease in \nR\n\n? . Recently another high-molecular weight tetrametallic supramolecular \n\ncomplex [(Ln-DTPA- phen)3Fe]\n-\n (Ln=Gd, Eu, La) has been obtained upon self-assembly \n\naround one of the three iron(II) ions 1,10-phenantroline- based molecules substituted in 5\u2019-\n\nposition with the polyaminocarboxylate diethylenetriamine- N,N,N\u2019,N\u2019,N\u2019-pentaacetate, \n\nDTPA- phen\n4-\n\n.\n112\n\n \n\nThere are reports of radical responsive CAs, consisting of Gd\n3+\n\n chelates \n\ncontaining a free thiol group (Gd-HASH-DO3A) conjugated through a disulfide bond \n\nformed with SH-activated phospholipid molecules incorporated in a liposome. The long \n\nreorientational motion of the supramolecular adduct ensures a \n1\n\nr  relaxivity much larger \n\nthan that of the free complex.\n 47\n\n The disulfide bonds represent a radical sensitive moiety \n\nand a large decrease in the relaxivity is observed upon their cleavage.\n113\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.2.5. CONTRAST AGENTS BASED ON OTHER PROPERTIES \n\n \n\nNew classes of MRI CAs have recently been developed, which do not fit into the \n\nclassification mentioned above. These CAs are based on their NMR properties and can be \n\ngrouped into two families, chemical exchange saturation transfer agents (CEST)\n114\n\n and \n\nhyperpolarized agents.  \n\n \n\n \n\nChemical exchange saturation transfer agents (CEST) \n\n \n\nBasically a CEST agent is a molecule possessing exchangeable protons (-NH, -\n\nOH, etc.) that resonate at a chemical shift different from that of the bulk water signal, \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n64 \n\nmeasurable when their exchange with the bulk water protons is slow on the NMR \n\ntimescale. This occurs when the difference in frequency between those chemical \n\nenvironments ( ?? ) is higher than the exchange rate of the process (\nex\n\nk ). When this \n\ncondition is fulfilled the resonance of the CEST mobile protons may be selectively \n\nsaturated using a specific radio frequency \n1\n\nB . These protons will then transfer into the \n\nbulk water pool and lead to a reduction of its equilibrium magnetization, resulting in a \n\ndecrease of its signal intensity. Consequently this water saturation process is caused by \n\nchemical exchange (see Figure 2.16). CEST agents can be used to switch the image \n\ncontrast \u2018on\u2019 and \u2018off\u2019 just by changing the irradiation parameters.\n 47 \n\n \n\n \n\nk\nex CEST\n\nAgent\n\nwater molecule\n\nmobile proton of CEST agent\n\nk\nex CEST\n\nAgent\n\nwater molecule\n\nmobile proton of CEST agent\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nk\nex CEST\n\nAgent\n\nwater molecule\n\nmobile proton of CEST agent\n\nk\nex CEST\n\nAgent\n\nwater molecule\n\nmobile proton of CEST agent\n\na)\n\nb)\n\n \n\nFigure 2.16. a) CEST agent illustration b) Schematics of the chemical \n\nexchange saturation transfer (CEST) method using molecular separation of \n\nencoding and detection for significant signal amplification. The resonance of \n\nthe detection molecule at high concentration (in this case, water) is observed \n\nafter off-resonance saturation (left spectrum) and after on-resonance \n\nsaturation (right spectrum) of a highly diluted CEST agent. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 65 \n\nSeveral agents contain exchangeable protons and consequently can generate \n\nCEST contrast.\n115\n\n Their signals are often very close to the bulk water signal, and broader \n\nthan 2 ppm, due to the magnetic field inhomogeneity of many tissues.\n116\n\n Within these \n\nconditions it is difficult to distinguish contrast due to the CEST effect and the direct \n\nsaturation of bulk water. Large ??  values improve the specificity of the CEST and, as \n\n??  increases with the magnetic field strength, the overall relationship between ??  and \n\nex\nk  will be a function of the field strength of the MR experiment.\n\n 47\n \n\nSince the attainable saturation transfer (ST) value is directly related to \nex\n\nk , it is \n\nexpected that paramagnetic complexes will display large ??  values for the exchanging \n\nproton resonance and thus may improve the efficacy of the CEST agents. These agents \n\nare called PARACEST agents and consist of particular Ln\n3+\n\n complexes with a coordinated \n\nwater molecule undergoing extremely slow exchange with the bulk water and with very \n\nlarge ??  values. A good ST effect was reported by Zhang et al.\n117\n\n by irradiating the \n\nmetal-bound water protons of Eu\n3+\n\n chelates resonating at 50 ppm downfield from the bulk \n\nwater. The very same effect can be obtained with slow exchanging amide protons of Ln\n3+\n\n \n\ncomplexes of DOTA derivatives.\n118\n\n Recent reports show that paramagnetic Ln\n3+\n\n \n\ncomplexes of tetraamide derivatives of DOTA have ST properties which are markedly \n\ndependent on pH and lactate concentration, making them responsive CAs.\n119,120,121\n\n \n\nThe main advantage of CEST agents relatively to the traditional MRI CAs is that \n\nthe generation of contrast only occurs when the RF irradiation frequency is set to the \n\nsame frequency as the absorption frequency of the mobile protons.\n 49\n\n For this reason it is \n\nnot necessary to register an image before the administration of the CEST agent, as the \n\nimage visualization of CEST agents results from the comparison of the on and off \n\nresonance MRI scan. Co-administration of different CEST agents is also possible as the \n\ndifference within the resonance frequencies of their mobile protons is large enough to \n\navoid the overlapping of the respective CEST resonances. The detection of their \n\nbiodistribution is possible and observable within the same image.\n122\n\n \n\nThe most critical disadvantage of CEST agents is their low sensitivity. \n\nTheoretically, the ST process is dominated by several parameters, among which \nex\n\nk  and \n\nthe number of mobile protons available are particularly relevant.\n 47 \n\nIn the case of small \n\nsized CEST agents, containing less than 10 mobile protons per molecule, such as amino \n\nacids, heterocyclic compounds, sugars or paramagnetic chelates, they have a detection \n\nlimit in the range of mM.\n114,119,123,124 \n\nSeveral approaches to solve this problem were \n\nsuggested.\n114,125-127 ,126,127,128 \n\n\n\n \nMagnetic Resonance Imaging Background Concepts \n\n \n\n \n\n66 \n\n \n\nHyperpolarized agents and molecular imaging using MRI. \n\n \n\nUndoubtedly MRI provides incomparable soft tissue contrast, however its low \n\nsensitivity has limited the clinical use to the imaging of water protons. A radically new \n\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, using hyperpolarized \n3\nHe, \n\n129\nXe, \n\n13\nC, \n\n15\nN \n\nand \n6\nLi is being developed to produce high-contrast images of important body tissues that \n\nhave resisted conventional MRI techniques. A totally different approach for increasing the \n\npolarization of spins is to create an artificial, non-equilibrium distribution of nuclear spins \n\ncalled the hyperpolarized state\n49\n\n. A hyperpolarized state is defined as a state in which the \n\nnuclear spin populations are altered with respect to the equilibrium value described by the \n\nBoltzmann equation. Since the signal intensity is proportional to the spin population\u2019s \n\ndifference, hyperpolarization leads to an increase in the NMR signal intensity by a factor \n\nas high as 10\n5\n.\n 48\n\n Hyperpolarization can improve the detection of \n3\nHe and \n\n129\nXe by up to a \n\nhundred thousand times. This technology is showing dramatic results for diagnostic \n\nimaging of the lungs, brain, and other parts of the body.\n49\n\n A wide range of organic \n\nsubstances containing \n13\n\nC has been hyperpolarized by either parahydrogen-induced \n\npolarization (PHIP)\n129\n\n or by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP).\n130\n\n The potential \n\napplications of hyperpolarized \n13\n\nC imaging include vascular imaging, perfusion imaging\n131\n\n, \n\ncatheter tracking\n132\n\n and visualization and metabolic/molecular imaging.\n133\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 67 \n\n \n\n2.4.

OPTICAL IMAGING \n\n \n\n \n\nUnlike any other imaging modality, optical imaging derives from the fact that it is \n\npossible to combine conventional display of tissue volumes using direct-optical, \n\ntransillumination or tomographic techniques, with the capability of gaining information on \n\nmolecular properties and function due to the high instrumental sensitivity for optical \n\nsignals. Taking into account the various principles of optical imaging methods but not \n\ndisregarding the limitation of penetration depth and spatial resolution in thick tissu es, a \n\nnumber of potential applications are envisioned for clinical diagnostics. Over the past few \n\nyears optical imaging techniques have joined the available methods for the assessment of \n\ntissue anatomy, physiology, metabolic and molecular function. This technology is \n\nattracting a lot of interest due to the fact that fluorescent dyes can be detected at low \n\nconcentrations and non-ionizing, harmless radiation can be applied repeatedly to the \n\npatient. This technology has the additional advantage that it is less expensive (compared \n\nto other imaging techniques), small in size and, therefore, easily at hand to solve clinical \n\nproblems. Table 3.1 summarizes the range of applications of optical imaging. The two \n\nleading imaging technologies are optical coherence tomography (OCT) and diffusion \n\nimaging. \n\n \n\nWithin this perspective the design of contrast agents for optical in vivo imaging of \n\ndiseased tissues has gained a remarkable vitality.\n1,2\n\n Light is one of the most convenient \n\nvectors for transmitting signals that can easily reach regions of a complex molecular \n\nstructure that are not accessible to other molecular messengers. When appropriate \n\nwavelengths are used, penetration depth may be substantial and light can reach regions \n\nof complex molecular structure which are not accessible to other molecular probes. \n\nSophisticated contrast agents have been synthesized and characterized for their \n\ncapability to monitor disease-specific anatomic, physiological and molecular parameters \n\nthrough their optical signals. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n81 \n\nTable 3.1.

This type of nanoparticles (NP) have been exploited for both in \n\nvitro analyses and in vivo imaging. Although their has been some reports regarding QDs \n\nwith near-infrared (NIR) emission and with low toxicity Therefore, their introduction into the \n\nbiological and medical media has been still slow.\n3,4,5\n\n Alternately trivalent lanthanide ions, \n\nLn\n3+\n\n, present another option to organic luminescent stains in view of their singular \n\nproperties. They enable easy spectral and time discrimination of their emission bands \n\nwhich span both the visible and NIR ranges. \n\nThe very first staining of biological cells with lanthanides dates back to 1969 \n\nby Scaff et al.\n6\n Bacterial smears (Escherichia coli cell walls) were treated with \n\naqueous ethanolic solutions of europium chelate of 4, 4, 4-trifluoro-1-(2-thienyl)-\n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n82 \n\n1,3-butanedione (thenoyltrifluoroacetonate, TTA) and bright red spots appeared under \n\nmercury lamp illumination. Only in the mid-1970s that further attention was accorded to \n\nluminescent lanthanide bioprobes when Finnish researchers in Turku proposed Eu\n3+\n\n, \n\nSm\n3+\n\n, Tb\n3+\n\n, and Dy\n3+\n\n polyaminocarboxylates and ?-diketonates as luminescent sensors in \n\ntime-resolved luminescent (TRL) immunoassays.\n7,8 \n\nThis technological push projected \n\nbroader interest and subsequent developments. Examples of these developments can be \n\nfound in homogeneous TRL assays,\n9\n optimization of bioconjugation methods for \n\nlanthanide luminescent chelates\n10\n\n and time-resolved luminescence microscopy (TRLM)\n11\n\n \n\nthat resulted in applications of lanthanide luminescent bioprobes (LLBs)\n12,13\n\n in many fields \n\nof biology, biotechnology and medicine, including tissue\n14,15\n\n and cell imaging,\n16,17\n\n analyte \n\nsensing\n18\n\n and monitoring drug delivery.\n19 \n\nIn order to design optical contrast agents it is necessary to first understand the \n\nconcept of luminescence, the optical properties of tissues as well as comprehend the \n\nexisting technology. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2. LUMINESCENCE \n\n \n\nThe term \u201cLuminescence\u201d was defined in 1888, by the German physicist Eilhardt \n\nWiedemann, as the light emission characteristics not conditioned by an increase in \n\ntemperature.\n20\n\n Within this thesis IUPAC rules\n21\n\n regarding molecular luminescence \n\nspectroscopy will be used, where the term \u2018\u2018fluorescence\u2019\u2019 is used for processes which \n\noccur without change in spin. These are typically \n01\n\nSS ?  (singlet to singlet ground state) \n\nor 27\n2\n\n25\n\n2\nFF ?  (Yb\n\n3+\n) transitions and \u2018\u2018phosphorescence\u2019\u2019 for transitions implying a change \n\nin spin, most commonly 01 ST ?  (triplet to singlet ground state) or JFD\n7\n\n0\n\n5\n?  (Eu\n\n3+\n) \n\ntransitions. The energy type used in the excitation of a luminescent material can be used \n\nto classify luminescent processes, as photoluminescence, when the excitation is by \n\nelectromagnetic radiation; cathodoluminescence, when a beam of electrons is used; \n\nelectroluminescence, when excitation is effected by an electric voltage; \n\ntriboluminescence, when mechanical energy is the source of excitation; and \n\nchemiluminescence, when energy of a chemical reaction is employed.\n22\n\n  \n\nNot all materials exhibit the luminescence phenomenon even though their molecules \n\ncan be excited to a higher state. This is due to the existence of a non-radiative pathway in \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n83 \n\nthe return to the ground state (GS). This transition from a vibration energy level of an \n\nexcited state to a vibration energy level of the GS is called internal conversion. The \n\npopulation of an excited state and the energy difference between the GS and excited \n\nstates are among the important factors that affect the luminescence of a material. Figure \n\n3.1 illustrates some of the typical processes involved in luminescence. The emission \n\nquantum yield indicates the efficiency of the luminescent material and will be defined in \n\nthe next section.\n23\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1. Partial energy-level diagram for a photoluminescent system.\n24\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLANTHANIDE LUMINESCENCE \n\n \n\n \n\nThe complex optical properties of the trivalent lanthanide ions, Ln\n3+\n\n, derives from \n\nspecial features of the electronic [Xe] \nN\n\nf4  configuration (N=0-14)). The third ionization \n\nstate is characterized (with the exception of lutetium, cerium and gadolinium) by the \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n84 \n\nremoval of two electrons from the 6s orbital and one form the 4f orbital. Lanthanides (Ce\u2013\n\nLu) are unique among the elements (with the exception of the actinides) in markedly \n\nresembling each other in their chemical properties, particularly regarding oxidation states, \n\ndue to their electronic configuration.\n25,26\n\n  \n\n \n\nThese configurations generate a large variety of energy levels. Figure 3.2 displays \n\npartial energy diagrams for the lanthanide aquo ions.\n21\n\n Eu\n3+\n\n, Gd\n3+\n\n, and Tb\n3+\n\n are the best \n\nions with respect to the energy gap requirement (as larger is that energy gap higher is the \n\nprobability of radiative transitions) as they present a larger band gaps when compared to \n\nother trivalent lanthanides with E? =12 300 ? ?\n6\n\n7\n\n0\n\n5\nFD ? , 32 200 ? ?\n\n27\n\n8\n\n27\n\n6\nSP ?  and 14 800 \n\n? ?\n0\n\n7\n\n4\n\n5\nFD ? , cm\n\n-1\n, respectively. Gd\n\n3+\n emits in the UV and it is not very useful as a \n\nluminescent probe since its luminescence interferes with either the emission or absorption \n\nprocesses in the organic part of the complex molecules.\n23\n\n The Russel-Saunders spin-orbit \n\ncoupling scheme\n*\n is normally used to characterize these energy levels, that is  based on \n\nthree quantum numbers, S , L  and J . It should be noted that this sheme does not \n\ncharacterize completely the energy levels, nevertheless, it is the commonly used.\n27\n\n The 4f \n\nelectrons are not the outermost ones and they are \u201cshielded \u201c from external fields by the \n\ntwo electronic orbitals 5s\n2\n and 5p\n\n6\n with larger radial extension. Thus 4f electrons are only \n\nweakly perturbed by surrounding ligands charges resulting in special spectroscopic \n\nproperties with parity-forbidden ff 44 ?  absorptions that have characteristic narrow-line \n\nemission (high purity). The emission occurs mostly in the visible and near-infrared (NIR) \n\nranges and with very low molar absorption coefficients, ? (or absorption cross-sections, \n\n?ABS). These are typically &lt;10 mol\n-1\n\n cm\n-1\n\n ( or ?ABS &lt;4 \u00d7 10\n-20\n\n cm\n2\n) when compared with \n\n                                                             \n\n*\n In this notation the orbital angular momenta of the individual electrons add up to form a resultant \n\norbital angular momentum L . Within the same strategy the individual spin angular momenta are \n\npresumed to couple to produce a resultant spin angular momentum S . Finally L and S  combine \n\nscattering events and form the total angular momentum J . In Russel-Saunders coupling scheme, \n\nthe terms J  and S  define one of the )12)(12( ??

Partial energy diagrams for the lanthanide aquo ions. The main \n\nluminescent levels are drawn in red, while the fundamental level is indicated in \n\nblue.\n23\n\n \n\n \n\nThe direct Ln\n3+\n\n photoexcitation is not very efficient as already mentioned. The \n\ndesign of lanthanide complexes, in which the ligands incorporate organic chromophores \n\nstrongly bonded to the f4  metal center, improves significantly the Ln\n3+\n\n luminescence \n\nintensity. Weissman demonstrated in 1942 that the excitation of lanthanide complexes into \n\nthe ligand states result in metal-centered luminescence. Part of the energy absorbed by \n\nthe organic receptor(s) is transferred onto Ln\n3+\n\n excited states and sharp emission bands \n\noriginating from the metal ion are detected after rapid internal conversion to the emitting \n\nlevel. These chromophores typically present effective absorption cross-sections 10\n4\n\u201310\n\n5\n \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n86 \n\ntimes higher and over a much broader spectral range than the Ln\n3+\n\n corresponding ones. \n\nThe phenomenon is termed sensitization of the metal-centered luminescence (also \n\nreferred to as \u201cantenna effect\u201d) and is quite complex.\n37\n\n  \n\nWhen the Ln\n3+\n\n ions are introduced into a host, the ion experiences an \n\ninhomogeneous electrostatic field, the so-called crystal field, which is produced by the \n\nLn\n3+\n\n ligands. In addition to the splitting of the energy of the f4  orbital by spin-orbit \n\ncoupling, individual J levels of a lanthanide ion are split further by the crystal field into a \n\nmaximum of 2J+1 components, depending on the local symmetry of the Ln\n3+\n\n ion, making \n\nthe lanthanide emissions extremely sensitive to their environments. Figure 3.3 displays a \n\nschematic representation and order of magnitude of the effects of the intra-atomic and \n\nligand field interactions acting on the \nN\n\nf4  configuration, in particular of the Eu\n3+\n\n ion. \n\nThe ff 44 ?  transitions have essentially electric-dipole (ED) and magnetic dipole \n\n(MD) character. ED transitions require a change of parity of the electron wavefunction \n\nand, then, they should be strictly forbidden within the f4  configuration (due to the Laporte \n\nselection rule). Contrarily, MD transitions between those levels are permitted. For Ln\n3+\n\n \n\nions localised in crystalline sites without inversion symmetry, however, a mixing of \n\nopposite-parity states into the \nN\n\nf4  levels occur resulting in a relaxation of the Laporte \n\nselection rule and then in the observation of intra- f4  forced ED transitions. \n\nImportant parameters such as radiative lifetime values, emission quantum \n\nefficiency and quantum yield should be determined in order to adequately \n\ncharacterize an optical material. The concepts referred in this thesis are further \n\ndescribed in Carlos L.D et al. .\n28\n\n The radiative lifetime (\nRAD\n\n? ) for a given '' Jf\nN\n?  \n\nexcited state is obtained as the reciprocal of the total transition radiative probability \n\nT\nA , which is the sum of all possible radiative decay rates from the state 'J  \n\ntowards lower levels J .

In the case of the Eu\n3+\n\n ion this important \n\nfeature is even more prominent, since Eu\n3+\n\n is a powerful local ion probe due to its peculiar \n\nspectroscopic characteristics.

Given that \n\nfor smaller gaps the desactivation through nonradiative process (e.g., O\u2013H \n\nvibrations) is more likely to happen; \n\n? A non-degenerated first excited state that allows a simpler Stark-effect \n\nanalysis, with the subsequent correspondence between the observed J-\n\nsplitting degeneracy and the Eu\n3+\n\n local-site symmetry; \n\n? The presence of the ligand-field-independent \n1\n\n7\n\n0\n\n5\nFD ?  magnetic-dipole \n\ntransition, as discussed above; \n\n? The presence of a single \n0\n\n7\n\n0\n\n5\nFD ?  line permitted for Cs,C1,2,3,4,6, and C2v,4v,6v \n\npoint symmetry groups with a predominantly electric-dipole nature, explained \n\nby J-mixing effects.\n42,43,44\n\n The energy of this non-degenerated transition can \n\nbe directly related to the covalency of the chemical bonds of the first \n\ncoordination shell in Eu\n3+\n\n (the so called nephelauxetic effect);\n45\n\n \n\n? The observation of vibronic lines in a relatively large spectral region of the \n\n2\n\n7\n\n0\n\n5\nFD ?  excitation transition (24400\u201321550 cm\n\n-1\n) allows the identification of \n\nvibration modes related to the Ln\n3+\n\n local environment up to ca. 3000 cm\n-1\n\n; \n\n? The presence of ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) in the UV-vis region \n\nof the excitation spectra assigned to particular ligand groups. \n\n \n\nImportant information about the metal-ion local coordination can be extracted from \n\nthree distinctive parameters: i) the changes in the number of Stark components of each \n\nintra- f4  manifold and the variations of their relative intensity, ii) differences observed in \n\nthe energy of particular lines, and iii) the analysis of the excited-state decay curves. \n\nExamples of the information extracted from these distinctive parameters are the existence \n\nof more than one Eu\n3+\n\n local symmetry group, the number of coordinated water molecules, \n\nthe magnitude of the ligand field, and the importance of the covalency of the Eu\n3+\n\n-ligands \n\nbonds.\n28 \n\n \n\nThe large values usually found for the full width at half maximum (fwhm) of the non -\n\ndegenerated 0\n7\n\n0\n\n5\nFD ?  line typically range from ca. 20 to 30 cm\n\n-1\n.\n46\n\n They indicate that the \n\nmatrix where the Eu\n3+\n\n ions are accommodated has a large distribution of similar local \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n91 \n\nsites. In the case where the Eu\n3+\n\n local symmetry group does not present an inversion \n\ncentre, the Laporte\u2019s rule is relaxed due to odd parity terms in the ligand field \n\nHamiltonian,\n38\n\n and the emission spectrum will be dominated by the \n2\n\n7\n\n0\n\n5\nFD ?  transition. \n\nFor Eu\n3+\n\n-containing materials the number of water molecules (\nw\n\nn ) in the first coordination \n\nshell may be obtained by the difference between the decay time values measured in H 2O \n\nand D2O as:\n28 \n\n \n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n??? 31.0\n\n11\n11.1\n\n22 ODOH\n\nw\nn\n\n??\n (3.8) \n\n \n\nwhere \nOH2\n\n?  and \nOD2\n\n?  are the decay times in milliseconds in water and in D2O, \n\nrespectively, taken in this latter case as the purely radiative decay.

TISSUE OPTICAL PROPERTIES \n\n \n\nThe optical properties of tissues are characterized by the use of light within the \n\nultraviolet (UV) and the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region. The interaction of photons with \n\ntissue is based on three processes: i) absorption of light, ii) scattering of light and iii) \n\nemission of fluorescence. Tissue optical properties can be characterized by using these \n\nparameters separately.\n47\n\n As the penetration depth of light in living tissue strongly depends \n\non the wavelength used,\n48\n\n the correct wavelength range should be chosen (since the \n\namount of absorption in tissue is a function of the wavelength). Normally, the extent of \n\nscattering in tissue decreases with increasing wavelength. For wavelengths below 600 \n\nnm, absorption dominates scattering resulting in a small penetration depth of hundredths \n\nof micrometers up to a few millimetres, so that only superficial assessment of tissues is \n\npossible in this spectral region. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n92 \n\nWhen direct visual inspection or characterization is used through microscopic \n\ntechniques high spatial resolution images of tissue structures is obtained. Some examples \n\nare the examination of tissue surfaces using optical fibres incorporated into endoscopes \n\nor laparoscopes, as well as of ocular diseases through ophthalmoscopes and the direct \n\nassessment of skin diseases or tissues during surgical procedures.\n43\n\n \n\n \n\nLight absorption in tissue originates from oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin, other \n\nporphyrins, melanin and structures involved in cellular metabolism (such as NADH and \n\nflavins) as well as from several structural tissue components (such as collagen), elastin \n\nand lipo-pigments. Most of these compounds exhibit characteristic fluorescence spectra \n\n(tissue autofluorescence) throughout the visible (VIS) spectral region up to approximately \n\n700 nm.\n49,50\n\n Fluorescence presented by these fluorescent markers provides additional \n\ninformation on tissue structure and pathophysiological states.\n49,51\n\n This tissue \n\nautofluorescence phenomenon has already been thoroughly exploited to extract spectral \n\npatterns which indicate diseased tissue areas, e.g. in lymph node characterization;\n52\n\n \n\nendoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract\n50,53,54\n\n or cardiovascular diagnosis.\n55\n\n  \n\n \n\nIn order to image a large tissue volume light within the spectral range (700\u2013900 nm) \n\nis necessary as the tissue absorption coefficient is relatively low (resulting in penetration \n\ndepths up to a few centimetres (figure 3.3).\n56\n\n It is also possible to identify inhomogeneities \n\nas they exhibit a difference in absorption or fluorescence when compared to bulk tissue. \n\n \n\nDue to the scattering process photons do not follow straight paths when propagating \n\nthrough tissue and mathematical models of photon transport are needed to calculate the \n\noptical properties of tissue.\n43\n\n This process limits the spatial resolution of the obtained \n\nimage, where morphological and structural tissue parameters are not accessible. Tissue \n\nabsorption is mainly determined by oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin and water, which \n\nexhibit a well defined absorption minimum in the NIR spectral region (figure 3.3) and \n\nprovide information that can be utilized to quantitatively calculate important physiological \n\nparameters, such as blood concentration (total haemoglobin) and oxygenation (ratio \n\noxy/deoxy haemoglobin).\n57\n\n The absorption data, together with tissue-dependent scattering \n\nproperties, can be fitted by mathematical models to reconstruct the most probable photon \n\npropagation throughout the tissue in order to generate a spatial map of tissue optical \n\nproperties for a given illumination and detection geometry. This method has predominantly \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n93 \n\nbeen applied in the detection of breast tumours and imaging brain functions. Photon \n\nmigration and diffuse light imaging are comprehensively described in reference.\n58\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3.

The near-infrared window of tissue is defined as the \n\nspectral region between approximately 700-900 nm, where the absorption \n\ncoefficients are at minimal levels.\n59\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4. OPTICAL IMAGING TECHNOLOGY \n\n \n\nOver the past decade different types of optical imaging techniques have been \n\ndeveloped for biomedical applications. These include various microscopy methods such \n\nas confocal microscopy, two-photon microscopy and coherent anti-Stokes Raman \n\nscattering (CARS) microscopy for in vitro and ex vivo applications as well as several \n\nmethods for in vivo applications such as bioluminescence imaging, fluorescence imaging, \n\ndiffused optical tomography and optical coherence tomography.\n43\n\n Several of these \n\ntechniques can be used in combination, either simultaneously or sequentially, to provide \n\ncomplementary information from the same cells, tissues, organs or animals.\n60,61 \n\nBoth bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging techniques have found wide \n\napplications for in vivo tumor optical imaging in mouse models, providing a non-invasive \n\nmethod with high resolution and a convenient real-time, high frequency visualization and \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n94 \n\nmeasurement of tumor biomarkers. The detection of disease progression and therapeutic \n\nresponse in the same animals is also possible. This minimizes the subject-to-subject \n\nvariability and reduces the animal number required by a traditional method.\n43\n\n Most \n\nimportantly, these in vivo studies can bridge the gap between in vitro (cell/tissue level) and \n\nin vivo (the whole animal) studies, while facilitating preclinical and further translational \n\nstudies.\n61 \n\nBioluminescence imaging (BLI) is typically based on the ATP- and O2-dependent \n\nenzymatic conversion of exogenous luciferin to oxyluciferin by luciferase within living cells. \n\nThis reaction can produce photons with a broad yellow emission spectrum with a peak \n\naround 560 nm, detectable with a highly sensitive charge-coupled device (CCD) camera \n\nat 10-12 min after intraperitoneal injection of luciferin. The bioluminescence phenomena \n\ncan last over 60 min in mice, providing multiple images of disease progression and \n\ntherapeutic response based on the changes in the number of cells with luciferase \n\nexpression or transcriptional activity. BLI has allowed quantitative measurements of tumor \n\nloadings, treatment response, immune cell trafficking and detection of gene transfer. It is \n\nalso possible to obtain spatio-temporal information of whole biological systems in vivo \n\nwithin a short time frame that may accelerate the development of experimental therapeutic \n\nstrategies.\n61,62,63\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, fluorescence imaging has an entirely different methodology that \n\nconsists of exciting certain fluorophores in a living system by using external light and \n\ndetecting fluorescence emission with a sensitive CCD camera. \n\nThere are several types of fluorophores: i) endogenous molecules (such as collagen \n\nor hemoglobin), ii) exogenous fluorescent molecules such as green fluorescent protein \n\n(GFP) or iii) small synthetic optical contrast agents. When compared to in vitro \n\nfluorescence microscope, in vivo fluorescence imaging is a complex process affected by \n\nmany factors.\n43\n\n One of the major limitations of in vivo fluorescence imaging is light \n\nattenuation and scattering due to adjacent living tissues. As previously mentioned light in \n\nthe near infrared (NIR) range (650-900 nm) can improve the light penetration.\n61,62,64\n\n It can \n\nalso minimize the autofluorescence of some endogenous absorbers such as hemoglobin, \n\nwater and lipids. In a full-body mouse illumination experiment, photon counts in the NIR \n\nrange (670 nm) are about four orders of magnitude higher when compared to those in the \n\ngreen light range (530 nm) under similar conditions. Hence NIR fluorescence imaging has \n\nproved to be an effective solution in improving the imaging depth along with sensitivity and \n\nspecificity. As a result NIR-fluorophores are important for successful in vivo optical \n\nimaging and future clinical applications. \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n95 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.5. OPTICAL CONTRAST AGENTS \n\n \n\nAs mentioned in the previous chapter, the general definition of Contrast Agents \n\n(CAs) is a chemical substance introduced to the anatomical or functional region being \n\nimaged in order to increase the differences between different tissues, or between normal \n\nand abnormal tissue. \n\nOptical contrast agents are frequently used to stain portions of biological samples in \n\norder to obtain a greater understanding of the molecular, cellular and physiological \n\nchanges at hand. Two important classes of these agents are the colorimetric and \n\nfluorescent markers. Colorimetric contrast agents modify the light absorption resulting in a \n\ncontrast of observed colour; while fluorescent agents also modify light agent, fluorescent \n\nabsorption, but subsequently re-emit a portion of the absorbed light at higher wavelengths \n\n(lower energy).\n43\n\n This phenomenon is leveraged to achieve greater sensitivity with the use \n\nof fluorescent markers. Through non illumination of the sample with light at the emission \n\nwavelengths of the fluorophore(s) present an enhanced signal to noise ratio will be \n\nachieved. In recent years, the attractiveness of fluorescent microscopy in biological \n\nsciences has grown; however, many challenges are still to be overcome in the application \n\nof fluorescent markers in biological systems. For instance, organic dyes are prone to rapid \n\nphotobleaching limiting their application to long-term bioimaging investigation.\n65,66\n\n Many \n\nother dyes also have relatively broad emission spectra complicating their integration into \n\nmulticolor imaging applications. In bioimaging, additional artifacts such as high light \n\nscattering via tissue interfaces, autofluorescence, and absorption by hemoglobin (Hb) in a \n\nmid-visible wavelength range are observed. The application of NIR range (650 to 900 nm) \n\ncontrast agents can overcome many of these issues and is preferred for bio-imaging thick \n\ntissues. The development of NIR imaging agents such as NIR quantum dots (QDs) and \n\ndyes (e.g. cyanine dyes) have recently attracted significant attention.\n67,68\n\n In the case of \n\noptical imaging CA, they are normally molecules or nanoparticles bearing one or more \n\nfluorophores. Typical optical imaging CAs are injected intravascularly or intraperitoneally \n\nand allowed to accumulate at the target site over several hours to days. Fluorophores can \n\nbe endogenous molecules (such as collagen or hemoglobin), exogenous fluorescent \n\nmolecules such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) or small synthetic optical CAs. \n\nWithin the last decades multifunctional contrast agents have emerged substantially \n\nwith the attempt to obtain the benefits of multiple imaging modalities with the use of a \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n96 \n\nsingle contrast agent.\n69,70\n\n One example can be found in the fluorescent and MRI active \n\nprobes that allow for simultaneous detection by MRI and fluorescence microscopy by \n\ncombining the advantages of 3D anatomical resolution at cellular level f rom MRI with the \n\nhigh sensitivity offered by fluorescence microscopy in a single particle. \n\n \n\n \n\nOrganic dyes \n\n \n\nOrganic dyes, such as rhodamine and fluoresceins are the earliest and most \n\nclassical luminescent materials employed in optical agents. Nevertheless, these dyes \n\nhave some problematic limitations that are critical to the quality of optical imaging. Broad \n\nemission bands (which can pose a problem in multiplexing and sensitivity), short \n\nluminescence lifetimes ca. 10\n-9\n\n s, a small Stokes shift (difficulty in separating the \n\nexcitation and emission signals), poor photochemical stability and susceptibility to \n\nphotobleaching (photochemical destruction of the fluorophore) on the \n71,72\n\n are the basic \n\ndrawbacks of these type of agents. Several attempts have been made in order to create \n\nnew fluorescent dyes that are more resistant to photobleaching and insensitive to pH \n\nchanges. The problem of short lifetimes and Stokes shift has still not been satisfactorily \n\novercome. Despite these setbacks organic dyes continue to be very popular due to their \n\nlow cost, high availability and practicality.\n72\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nQuantum dots \n\n \n\nQuantum dots (QDs) are crystalline semiconductors typically less than 10 nm in \n\ndiameter and are considered to be another promising luminescent tag for optical imaging. \n\nThey are reported to be several thousand times more stable against photobleaching, \n\nmuch brighter and have a spectral width reduced by up to one-third from conventional \n\norganic dyes.\n73,74\n\n \n\nOne of the special features of QDs is its emission wavelengths variation that is \n\nstrongly size dependent: They can emit different colours spanning the entire visible/NIR \n\nregion within the same material by merely changing the size of the particles. This is a \n\nconsequence of the so called quantum confinement effect: a confinement of the hole and \n\nelectron wave functions in the nanocrystals when the size of the particles are reduced \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n97 \n\nbeyond the bulk-exciton Bohr radius, and consequently, an increase in the semiconductor \n\nband gap.\n72-78\n\n A combination of the broad absorption bands of QDs, narrow emission \n\nbands and their size dependent emissions offer the possibility of using them to tag \n\nbiomolecules in ultrasensitive biological detection and in bioapplications such as gene-\n\nexpression studies, high-throughput screening and medical diagnostics based on optical-\n\ncoding technology.\n75\n\n Generally QDs have longer lifetimes (20- 50 ns) than that of organic \n\ndyes by one order of magnitude and so QDs are highly regarded as a new generation \n\nmaterials capable of bringing immense benefits to medical diagnosis.\n76,79\n\n   \n75,76,77,7879\n\n \n\nOn the other hand, there are a few limitations that QDs have to overcome in order to \n\nbe the ideal candidates for optical tags. An example is the danger of releasing toxic \n\nelements into biological systems, especially in in vivo analyses. The most optically \n\nefficient QDs are engineered with one or more toxic element such as cadmium and \n\nselenium.\n80\n\n CdSe QDs have luminescence properties from near UV to NIR regions with \n\nsize-tunable absorption, this broad absorption band provide two advantages: i) freedom to \n\nselect any excitation wavelength below the band gap energy and ii) minimize background \n\nby increasing Stokes shift. Another reported limitation of QDs is their tendency to suffer \n\nfrom optical blinking emission (continued on-off emission), a situation that is detrimental to \n\nreal time imaging\n72,81-84\n\n    \n81,82,83,84\n\n \n\nAs already mentioned QDs are more resistant to photobleaching than organic dyes, \n\nhowever some studies have reported various degrees of QDs fluorescence quenching \n\nunder irradiation in ambient environment, where some of the authors\n85,86\n\n conclusively \n\npointed out photo-oxidation of the nanocrystals as the main/primary cause. In order to \n\novercome photo-oxidation limitation researchers attempted to coat the QDs with a \n\nprotective layer (shell) forming a core-shell type QD, where the inner core would be a \n\nsemiconductor material, while the shell would be another semiconductor but with a wider \n\nband gap\n87\n\n. Unfortunately this attempt did not reach expectations. Within the same \n\nperspective emerged the coating with thiols\n88,89,90\n\n, polymers\n91,92,93\n\n or silica\n94,95\n\n serving not \n\nonly as protective layers but as platforms for possible bioconjugations introducing \n\nmutimodal prespective to QD. \n\nIn conclusion, invaluable effort is being invested by many researchers with \n\nuncompromised intentions to resolve the toxicity of high-quality QDs and develop non-\n\ntoxic QDs in order to offer all the advantages of QDs to biomedical imaging and \n\ntherapeutic interventions. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n98 \n\nLanthanide Chelates (and time resolved fluorescence) \n\n \n\nConsiderable interest has been allotted to the application of kinetically stable \n\nlanthanide complexes as probes for biological imaging and assaying.\n96,97\n\n While efforts \n\nhave been concentrated their on the development of gadolinium agents (as MRI contrast \n\nagents),\n35,98\n\n luminescent trivatent lanthanide ions such as terbium (Tb), europium (Eu), \n\nytterbium (Yb) and neodymium (Nd) also have much to offer.\n99,100\n\n The large Stokes shifts \n\nand long-lived emission commonly associated with sensitised emission from these ions \n\nensures the usage of time-gated spectroscopy to separate such long-lived signals from \n\nthe short-lived signals that arise from scattered light and biological fluorescence.\n101\n\n As a \n\nresult considerable interest has been given the use of luminescent lanthanides in \n\nbioassays and more recently the possibility of using time-resolved spectroscopy and \n\nmicroscopy.\n103-105\n\n \n\nLanthanide complexes can be tailor-made to exhibit different luminescent lifetimes \n\nby the exclusion of solvent molecules from the inner hydration sphere of the lanthanide \n\nion. Therefore such complexes can be used in microscopy applications to gain more \n\ndetailed information. Lanthanide complexes can be distinguished by their characteristic \n\nwavelengths of emission (due to the metal centre), very sharp emission bands (typically \n\nwith a full width at half maximum of less than 10 nm) and their luminescent lifetimes (ca. \n\n10\n-3\n\n s), which are controlled by their coordination environment.\n71\n\n       \n102103104105 \n\nTime-resolved fluorescence (TRF), which is more or less an exclusive preserve of \n\nlanthanides compounds, has become by far the most effective way of eliminating \n\nbackground interferences in order to enhance sensitivity.\n102-105\n\n The introduction of a time \n\ndelay (~ 1 or 100 ?s), prior to detection of the emitted light eliminates interference from \n\nlight scattering and auto-fluorescence enhancing greatly the signal to noise ratio \n\n(detection limits are conservatively in the 10\n-12\n\n \u2013 10\n-15\n\n M range) and hence the reliability of \n\ndetection and monitoring.\n102\n\n The principle of TRF is illustrated in figure 3.4 and involves \n\nsequentially an excitation of the system, cessation of the excitation allowing enough decay \n\ntime (during which the typical fluorescence from dyes and QDs would have decayed) for \n\nbackground interferences to have disappeared and measuring the luminescence of the \n\nlanthanide.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n99 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4. Principle of TRF. The excitation is removed, followed by a \n\nsufficient time delay, and later measurement of lanthanide fluorescence and \n\nthe cycle can continue thereafter with new excitation.\n106\n\n \n\n \n\nAn important point in the design of an efficient lanthanide-based probe is to protect \n\nthe lanthanide cation from solvent molecules. Particular attention should be paid in \n\nprotecting the cation from water as the lanthanide emission is quenched by the presence \n\nof water molecules in the first coordination sphere of the lanthanide (non-radiative \n\ndeactivation through O-H vibrators). NIR emitting lanthanide ions commonly have a lower \n\nquantum yield than those other lanthanide ions emitting in the visible range, since their \n\nnon-radiative transitions have higher probability with regards to the lanthanide ions \n\nemitting in the visible range.Nevertheless, as previously mentioned, they are more \n\nsuitable for biological applications as they can be excited at lower energy and NIR \n\nphotons can go deeper into tissue. \n\n \n\nSeveral research groups have devoted great effort to designing organic ligands, a \n\ngreat variety of which are now described in the literature and reviewed by B\u00fcnzili.\n37\n\n In \n\ngeneral, small variations in a ligand structure can lead to remarkable changes in the \n\nphotophysical properties. Several types of lanthanide carboxylates have been reported.\n107\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n100 \n\nLanthanide doped nanoparticles \n\n \n\nLanthanide doped NPs have emerged as a fast-growing platform in cell imaging due \n\nto the generation of low background noise for their NIR emission. To date the lanthanide \n\noxide phosphor system has been the widely studied. Meiser et al. reported the synthesis \n\nof monodisperse fluorescent LaPO4 NPs\n.108,109,110\n\n These NPs, approximately 7 nm in size, \n\nhave fluorescence that originates from their bulk properties - transitions between d and f \n\nelectron states and their local symmetry - and is independent of their size. These NPs \n\nwere biofunctionalized via biotin-avidin chemistry with good photostability and fluorescent \n\nproperties.\n111\n\n \n\nSetua et al. produced highly monodispersed Eu\n3+\n\n and Gd\n3+\n\n doped Y2O3 nanocrystals \n\nand presented bi-modal imaging applications of both paramagnetism that enabled \n\nmagnetic resonance imaging and bright red-fluorescence. This aided the optical imaging \n\nof cancer cells, targeted specifically to their molecular receptors.\n112\n\n \n\nLanthanide up-converting NPs (UCNPs) are rare-earth doped ceramic-type \n\nmaterials such as oxides, oxysulfides, fluorides or oxyfluorides which convert infra-red \n\nlight into the visible spectrum. They are usually synthesized as nanospheres and were \n\nintroduced as probes for bioassays in the 1990s. Most of these UCNPs contain Er\n3+\n\n ions \n\nas two-color (green, 540 nm; red, 654 nm) emitters and Yb\n3+\n\n ions as sensitizers, but other \n\nLn\n3+\n\n pairs have also been proposed (e.g., Tm\n3+\n\n/Ho\n3+\n\n/Yb\n3+\n\n/Tm\n3+\n\n). These type of NPs \n\npresent several advantages over classical bioprobes, including high sensitivity, \n\nmultiplexing ability if several different Ln\n3+\n\n ions are co-doped, low sensitivity to \n\nphotobleaching and cheap laser diode excitation, in addition to deep penetration of the \n\nexcitation NIR light. Initially, they were used in luminescent immunoassays. Presently their \n\napplications have been extended to luminescence imaging of cancerous cells.\n113\n\n Novel \n\nimaging systems based on UCNPs have been designed\n114\n\n and improved sensitivity of \n\ndown to single molecule detection within cells is foreseen.\n115116117 \n\nLanthanide up-converting NPs (UCNPs) have been developed as a new generation \n\nof luminescent labels due to their superb optical features, long lifetimes and excellent \n\nphotostability. Among various kinds of UCNPs, NaYF4 is the most well-known system that \n\nhas been employed in both cellular and in vivo animal imaging.\n118,119,120 \n\nSince the growth of this field is rapidly developing it is foreseen that lanthanide \n\ndoped NPs will find their way into even more elaborate biotechnological applications in the \n\ncoming future due to their relatively simple nanocomposition, deep penetration depth of \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n101 \n\nNIR and other advantageous physical features. Due to the potentially high toxicity of \n\nlanthanides, more detailed investigations will probably be required to evaluate their \n\nbiochemical and physiological behaviours before lanthanide doped NPs are eventually \n\napproved for biomedical applications. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nFluorescence Imaging Background Concepts \n \n\n \n102 \n\n \n\n3.6.

INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\nCurrently, clinical diagnostics and biomedical research employ an array of \n\npowerful in vivo imaging techniques, including confocal and Two-Photon Microscopy, \n\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),\n1\n X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT),\n\n2\n Positron \n\nEmission Tomography (PET),\n3,4\n\n Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography \n\n(SPECT),\n5,6\n\n and Ultrasound.\n7\n Each of these techniques possesses unique strengths \n\nand weaknesses (spatial and temporal resolution and sensitivity limits), thus providing \n\ncomplementary information. Certain fused-modality instruments, such as PET/CT, have \n\nalready appeared in the clinic.\n6\n \n\nMRI has an excellent spatial resolution but suffers from low sensitivity, often \n\nrequiring the administration of millimolar concentrations of commercial Gd\n3+\n\n-based \n\ncontrast agents (CAs), in order to increase the intrinsic image contrast for an efficient \n\ndetection of pathologies.\n8-12\n\n Radioactive tracers and optical imaging probes are orders \n\nof magnitude more sensitive and may be detected at much lower concentrations \n\n(picomolar or micromolar for PET or optical agents, respectively) but the corresponding \n\nimaging modalities have low spatial resolution.\n13,14\n\n      \n891011121314\n\n \n\nThere has been an increasing interest in the development of multimodal imaging \n\nagents, integrating in a single molecular entity the requirements of MRI and a second \n\nimaging modality. Bimodal MRI and optical imaging probes combine the spatial \n\nresolution and unlimited tissue penetration of MRI with the sensitivity of optical imaging. \n\nThe efficiency of this combined imaging technique has been demonstrated in studies \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n114 \n\nwith animals. Modo et al. used a gadolinium-rhodamine-dextran agent to confirm by \n\nfluorescence microscopy that tracking of transplanted stem cells in ischemia-damaged \n\nrat hippocampus was possible by MRI.\n15\n\n Recently, several examples of bimodal agents \n\nhave been synthesised and evaluated, including Gd\n3+\n\n complexes connected to organic \n\ndyes,\n16-18\n\n complexes of Gd\n3+\n\n and other visible\n19-24 \n\nor near infrared (NIR)\n25,26  \n\nemitting \n\nLn\n3+\n\n ions, or various kinds of nanoparticle (NP) based systems.\n17-34\n\n              \n\n16171819202122232425262728293031323334\n \n\nLanthanide ions are particularly well suited for the design of bimodal MRI and \n\noptical agents.\n35\n\n Their unique electronic configuration affords exceptional magnetic and \n\noptical properties and similar chemical behaviour. Therefore, the replacement of one \n\nlanthanide by another, results in compounds with different physical properties but no \n\nmajor chemical differences. The advantage of using Gd\n3+\n\n complexes as MRI contrast \n\nagents has been largely demonstrated.\n8\n The Gd\n\n3+\n ion possesses seven unpaired \n\nelectrons (highest spin density) and a symmetrical \n8\nS ground state, resulting in a slow \n\nelectronic relaxation rate, and these are excellent features for reducing the longitudinal \n\n(\n1\n\nT ) and transverse (\n2\n\nT ) proton relaxation times of tissue water, thus enhancing image \n\ncontrast. For example, [Gd(DTPA)(H2O)]\n2-\n\n has been approved for radiologic practice \n\nand medicine in 1988.\n36\n\n  \n\nAll Ln\n3+\n\n ions, exception for La\n3+\n\n and Lu\n3+\n\n, are photoluminescent, some more \n\nefficient than others. Eu\n3+\n\n and Tb\n3+\n\n are the most commonly ions used because they \n\nemit in the visible spectrum (in the red and green regions, respectively) and have long \n\nluminescence lifetimes, in the millisecond range).\n14,37,38\n\n There are several advantages \n\nin using lanthanide complexes as luminescent probes versus organic dyes: i) \n\nresistance to photobleaching; ii) long-lived excited states, allowing the short-lived (ns \n\nrange) biological background fluorescence to disperse before the lanthanide emission \n\noccurs; iii) absence of reabsorption; and iv) sharp emission bands (wavelengths are \n\ncharacteristic of the lanthanide).\n25\n\n Despite these positive features of lanthanides, \n\nreports on the use of Ln\n3+\n\n complexes in the design of combined MRI and optical probes \n\nare scarce.\n19-23 \n\nThe luminescence properties of the lanthanides ions may be enhanced \n\nby intramolecular energy transfer from moieties attached to the central ion, the so -\n\ncalled \u201cantenna effect\u201d. It is well known that the introduction of an aromatic ligand \n\ninduces a considerable antenna effect, therefore enhancing the luminescence \n\nproperties of the lanthanide ions.\n \n \n\nOur approach is to combine the potential of the lanthanide complexes with the \n\nproperties of NPs since these have the ability to i) carry large payloads of active \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 115 \n\nmagnetic centres, therefore lowering the required concentrations, ii) be target-specific \n\nby labelling desired cells through phagocytic pathways, and iii) be grafted by molecules \n\nspecific to cell surface markers. Many alternative designs of efficient nanosized carriers \n\nfor MRI probes have been proposed.\n39,40\n\n Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have \n\nbeen shown to be very useful platforms for efficient relaxometric contrast agents \n\nbecause of their ability to carry a large payload of Gd\n3+\n\n chelates with high water \n\naccessibility and, thus, they have been used as multimodal probes after incorporation \n\nof a fluorescent dye into the silica carrier.\n41-46\n\n Core-shell hybrid nanoporous silica NPs \n\ncontaining a luminescent [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2 core (bpy = 2,2\u2019bypyridine) and a paramagnetic \n\nmonolayer coating of a silylated Gd(III) complex has also been studied.\n30,47,48 \n\n41,42,43,44,45,464748\n \n\nAs a proof of concept, here report on the derivatization of nanoporous silica NPs \n\nwith aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS), followed by reaction with diethylenetriamine \n\npentaacetic acid (DTPA) and complexation of Ln\n3+\n\n ions, forming the DTPA monoamide \n\nsystem SiO2@APS/DTPA:Ln (Ln = Eu\n3+\n\n, Tb\n3+\n\n and Gd\n3+\n\n). The thermodynamic stability \n\nconstant of the Gd\n3+\n\n-DTPA complex is quite high, with a log K value of 22.46, which is \n\nvery similar to the values for the Eu\n3+\n\n and Tb\n3+\n\n complexes.\n49\n\n It has been previously \n\nshown that, although the thermodynamic stability constants for Gd-DTPA monoamides \n\ndecrease by log K ~2.6 relative to the Gd-DTPA ones, their blood pH conditional \n\nconstants differ from Gd-DTPA only by log K ~1.2.\n50\n\n SiO2@APS/DTPA:Ln nanoparticles \n\nare not toxic\n51\n\n and similar materials accumulate mostly in the liver and spleen whereas \n\nthe lung, kidney, and heart accounted for an accumulation of less than 5%.\n52\n\n The \n\nluminescence and water proton nuclear relaxation properties of these NPs both, in \n\naqueous suspensions, and internalized in RAW 264.7 cells (mouse macrophage cell \n\nline), are studied in order to evaluate their usefulness as bimodal agents for MRI and \n\noptical imaging. \n\nWe also report the synthesis and grafting of nanoporous silica NPs with APS and \n\na Ln\n3+\n\n complex with a ligand possessing an aromatic ring, which acts as an antenna for \n\nsensitizing Ln\n3+\n\n, thus improving light emission. Silica NPs are, thus, modified with \n\n2,2',2\",2'\" \u2013 [(pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(methylenenitrilo)] tetrakis (acetic acid) (PMN), via a \n\nreaction with APS grafted on the NPs. Ln\n3+\n\n are complexed by PMN, forming the system \n\nSiO2@APS/PMN:Ln (Ln = Eu, Tb and Gd). The water proton nuclear relaxation and \n\nluminescence properties of such derivatized NPs in aqueous suspensions and \n\ninternalized in RAW 264.7 cells (mouse macrophage cell line) cells are studied, in \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n116 \n\norder to assess their efficacy as Ln\n3+\n\n-based bimodal agents for MRI and optical \n\nimaging. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n\n \n\nMaterials and purification methods \n\n \n\nEuCl3 (99.99%), TbCl3 (99.99%), GdCl3 (99.99%), Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) \n\n(98%), 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) (97%), diethylenetriamine pentaacetic bis-\n\nanhydride (DTPAA) (99.99%), 2,6-bis(bromomethyl) pyridine (98%), di(tert-butyl) \n\niminobis(acetate) (98%), dry Na2CO3  (99.5%), dry acetonitrile (MeCN) (99.8%), \n\ntrifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH) (99%) and diethyl ether (Et2O) (99.7%); N-\n\nhydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (98%), (1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethyl aminopropyl]carbodiimide \n\nHydrochloride (EDC) (99%) and Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were purchased from \n\nAldrich. Absolute ethanol (J.T. Baker) and ammonium hydroxide solution (5N) (Fluka) \n\nwere used as received. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Water was \n\ndeionized (resistivity larger than 18 MQ). \n\n \n\nPreparation of silica nanoparticles suspension \n\n \n\nThe method used was derived from the so-called St\u00f6ber\n48,53\n\n process, widely used \n\nfor the synthesis of silica beads with diameters from a few tens to a few hundreds of \n\nnanometers\n54\n\n and based on the hydrolysis/condensation of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) \n\ncatalyzed by ammonia in alcoholic media. Briefly, a solution of 250 mL of absolute \n\nethanol and 17 mL ammonia was heated at 50 \u00baC and 0.035 mol TEOS was added \n\nallowing reflux overnight. The average particle size, determined by transmission \n\nelectron microscopy was 67 \u00b1 6 nm. \n\n \n\nPreparation of the grafted amino-nanoparticles \n\n \n\nTo the silica NPs suspension 4.5 mmol of APS (0.8 mL) were added and stirred \n\nfor 3 h. The suspension was then left under reflux overnight. The nanoparticles were \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 117 \n\nthen washed and purified by centrifugation three times with ethanol and then water to \n\nremove unreacted APS. \n\n \n\nPreparation of the DTPA-grafted amino-nanoparticles \n\n \n\nThe amino-modified NPs suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant \n\ndiscarded, the wet NPs were slowly diluted in 20 mL of an ethanol-acetic acid solution \n\n50/50 v/v % and 1 g of diethylene triaminepentaacetic bis-anhydride (DTPAA) was then \n\nslowly added to the solution (20/1 DTPAA/-NH2) at room temperature. The system was \n\nheated up and left to reflux overnight. The particles were filtered off and purified three \n\ntimes by centrifugation-redispersion in acetone-water 50/50 v/v % and finally three \n\ntimes in water. \n\n \n\nPreparation of the Ln\n3+\n\n- DTPA chelate-grafted amino-nanoparticles \n\n \n\nThe DTPA-grafted NPs were redispersed in 20 mL of water. At room \n\ntemperature, 0.3 mmol of LnCl3 (0.11g for GdCl3) were slowly added to the colloidal \n\nsuspension. This amount corresponds approximately to the quantity of molecules \n\ngrafted onto the particles in the 20 mL of solution, assuming a coverage rate of 6 \n\n\u00b5mol/m\u00b2. After 24 h, the excess of unreacted Ln(III) was removed by centrifugation-\n\nredispersion three times in water. \n\n \n\nPreparation of the 2,2',2\",2'\"\u2013[(Pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis methylene nitrilo)] \n\ntetrakis(acetic acid) compound (PMN) \n\n \n\nFirst the tetra(tert-butyl)2.2',2\",2\"'-[(Pyridine-2,6-diyl)bis(methyleneni trilo)] tetrakis \n\n(acetate) compound (1) was synthesized. A mixture of 2,6-bis(bromomethyl)pyridine \n\n(318 mg, 1.20 mmol, solid), di(tert-butyl) iminobis(acetate) (588 mg, 2.40 mmol, solid), \n\ndry Na2CO3 (630 mg, 6.0 mmol, solid) and dry MeCN (30 ml) was refluxed overnight \n\nunder argon. Filtration (obtaining a yellow solution) and evaporation gave pure \n\ncompound (yellow gel) (412 mg, 72%). \n1\nH-NMR (CDCl3) ? (ppm):  1.44 (s, 36 H); 3.47 \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n118 \n\n(s, 8 H); 4.00 (s, 4 H); 7.48 (d, J = 7.5, 2 H); 7.63 (T, J = 75, 1 H). A solution of \n\ncompound (1) (412 mg, 0.86 mmol) in CF3COOH (10 ml) was stirred for 2 h at RT. \n\nAfter evaporation, the mixture was triturated with Et2O and filtered to give pure \n\ncompound (dark yellow gel) (288 mg, 92%). \n1\nH-NMR (DMSO) ? (ppm): 3.62 (s, 8 H); \n\n4.24 (s,4 H); 7.75 (d, J = 7.5, 2 H); 8.23 (t, J = 7.5, 1 H). \n\n \n\nPreparation of the PMN-grafted amino-nanoparticles \n\nThe amino-modified NPs suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant \n\ndiscarded, the wet NPs were slowly diluted in 10 mL of PBS. While 0.5 g of PMN (1.35 \n\nx 10\n-3\n\n mol) were added to 15 mL of PBS, a yellow solution was formed. A solution of \n\nEDC was also prepared by adding 258.9 mg (1.35 x 10\n-3\n\n mol) in 4 mL of PBS. To the \n\nPMN solution 15.54 mg of NHS (1.35 x 10\n-4\n\n mol) was added and stirred at room \n\ntemperature. Sequentially the EDC and NPs solutions were added, respectively. The \n\nsystem was left to react overnight. The particles were filtered off and purified three \n\ntimes by centrifugation-redispersion in water. \n\n \n\nPreparation of the Ln\n3+\n\n-PMN chelate-grafted amino-nano-particles \n\nThe PMN-grafted NPs were redispersed in 20 mL of water. At room temperature, \n\n33.3 ?mol of LnCl3 (8.78 mg for GdCl3) were slowly added to the colloidal suspension. \n\nThis amount corresponds approximately to the quantity of molecules grafted onto the \n\nparticles in the 10 mL of solution, assuming a coverage rate of 6 \u00b5mol/m\u00b2. After 24 h, \n\nthe excess of unreacted Ln(III) was removed by centrifugation-redispersion three times \n\nin water. \n\n \n\nCell culture and in vivo imaging \n\nRAW 264.7 cells (mouse macrophage cell line) were maintained at 37 \u00b0C, under \n\n5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (DMEM-HG) (Sigma) \n\nsupplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma), \n\npenicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 ?g/mL), and sodium bicarbonate (1.6 g/L). \n\nCells were incubated with the respective NPs (2.5 x 10\n15\n\n Part/L for both types of NPs \n\nSAD:Ln and SAPMN:Ln ) at 37 \u00b0C, under 5% CO2, for 1 hour. After this incubation, \n\ncells were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, for 15 min at room \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 119 \n\ntemperature, and rinsed again with PBS. Then, cells were detached from the culture \n\nflasks by scraping, the cell suspensions were prepared in PBS and the cell pellets were \n\nobtained by centrifugation at 180g during 5 min. \n1\n\nT -weighted MRI images of the cellular \n\npellets were acquired on a 3.0 T Siemens TimTrio scanner, using a spin--echo \n\nsequence (TE = 12 ms, TR = 3000 ms, FOV= 100x 100, slice thickness = 3.00 mm, \n\nmatrix = 128 x 256 at room temperature for SAD:Ln NPs and TE = 50 ms, TR = 3000 \n\nms, FOV= 100x 100, slice thickness = 3.00 mm, matrix = 128 x 256 at room \n\ntemperature for SAPMN:Ln NPs). The optical images were obtained by submitting the \n\ncellular pellets to a 450 W Xe arc lamp, as the excitation source and photographs were \n\ntaken with a Canon 550D with EF-S 18-55mm. \n\n \n\nParticles Characterization \n\n \n\nTEM was performed at room temperature on a JEOL JEM-2000 FX transmission \n\nelectron microscope using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Drops of diluted \n\ndispersions of nanoparticles were air-dried on carbon films deposited on 200-mesh \n\ncopper grids. The excess liquid was blotted with filter paper. Diffuse Reflectance \n\nInfrared Fourier-Transform (DRIFT) spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS Equinox \n\n55FTIR spectrometer (signal averaging 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm\n-1\n\n in KBr pellets \n\ncontaining ca. 2 mass % of material). The zeta potential of the nanoparticles was \n\nmeasured using a Zetasizer 3000HSA setup (Malvern Instruments) equipped with a \n\nHe- Ne laser (50 mW, 532 nm). The zeta potential measurement based on laser \n\nDoppler interferometry was used to measure the electrophoretic mobility of \n\nnanoparticles. Measurements were performed for 20 s using a standard capillary \n\nelectrophoresis cell. The dielectric constant was set to 80.4 and the Smoluchowsky \n\nconstant f(ka) was 1.5. The silica, europium, terbium, and gadolinium contents were \n\nmeasured by inductively coupled plasma / optical emission spectrometry ICP/OES \n\n(ES720, Varian) equipped with a crossflow nebulizer. Solutions for each element with a \n\nconcentration of 1 g/L were used to prepare the standard solutions (SCP Science to \n\nParis) and were used as internal standard to evaluate the instrumental drift. \n\nThe \n29\n\nSi magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), \n29\n\nSi \n\ncross-polarization (CP) MAS NMR and \n13\n\nC CP/MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a \n\nBruker Avance III 400 (9.4 T) spectrometer at 79.49 and 100.62 MHz, respectively. \n29\n\nSi \n\nMAS NMR spectra were recorded with 2 ?s (tip angle ca. 30\u00ba) rf pulses, a recycle delay \n\nof 60 s and 5.0 kHz spinning rate.\n 13\n\nC CP/MAS NMR spectra were recorded with 4 ?s \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n120 \n\n1\nH 90\u00ba pulses, 2 ms contact time, a recycle delay of 4 s and at a spinning rate of 8 kHz. \n\n1\nH NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-300 spectrometer at 300.13 MHz, \n\nusing CDCl3 as the solvent. Chemical shifts are quoted in ppm from tetramethylsilane \n\n(TMS) and coupling constants J in Hz. Multiplicities are described with abbreviations as \n\nfollow: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quadruplet), m (multiplet). Spectra are \n\ndescribed as ? (multiplicity, number of protons, assignment, coupling constant).  \n\n1\nH longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (\n\n1\nT  and \n\n2\nT  respectively) of \n\naqueous suspensions of nanoparticles were measured at 20 MHz on a Bruker \n\nMinispec mq20 relaxometer and at 499.83 MHz (B0= 11.7 T) on a Varian Unity 500 \n\nNMR spectrometer, at 25 and 37 \u00baC. \n1\n\nT  values were measured using the inversion \n\nrecovery pulse sequence, while \n2\n\nT\n \nvalues were measured using a Carr-Purcell-\n\nMeiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence. The time interval between two consecutive \n\nrefocusing pulses (?CP) in the train of 180\no\n pulses applied was 1.6 ms. The values of \n\n*\n\n2\nT , the transverse relaxation time in the presence local field inhomogeneities, were \n\nobtained from the water spectral line widths. All the experimental values were corrected \n\nfor the diamagnetic contributions using aqueous suspensions of their respective NPs \n\ncarrier SiO2@APS/DTPA (SAD) and SiO2@APS/PMN (SA/PMN) under the same \n\nconditions. The r2 values were also measured as a function of the ?CP parameter in a \n\nCPMG pulse sequence, for aqueous suspensions of the various NPs (?CP = 0.05, 0.2, \n\n0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 2, 3). \n\nThe photoluminescence spectra were recorded between 14 K and room \n\ntemperature with a modular double grating excitation spectrofluorimeter with a TRIAX \n\n320 emission monochromator (Fluorolog-3, Jobin Yvon-Spex) coupled to a R928 \n\nHamamatsu photomultiplier, using the front face acquisition mode. The excitation \n\nsource was a 450 W Xe arc lamp. The emission spectra were corrected for detection \n\nand optical spectral response of the spectrofluorimeter and the excitation spectra were \n\nweighed for the spectral distribution of the lamp intensity using a photodiode reference \n\ndetector. The lifetime measurements were acquired with the setup described for the \n\nluminescence spectra using a pulsed Xe-Hg lamp (6 ?s pulse at half width and 20\u201330 \n\n?s tail). The absolute emission quantum yields were measured at room temperature \n\nusing a Quantum Yield Measurement System C9920-02 from Hamamatsu with a 150 \n\nW Xenon lamp coupled to a monochromator for wavelength discrimination, an \n\nintegrating sphere as sample chamber and a multi channel analyzer for signal \n\ndetection. \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 121 \n\n4.3.

The absorption bands in the DRIFT \n\nspectrum of the SiO2@APS samples (Figure 4.3) are assigned to APS and bare silica, \n\nevidencing the efficient APS-silanization of the silica NPs. The modification of the \n\nshape of the band at 3500 cm\n-1\n\n is due to the N-H vibrations. The 2983 cm\n-1\n\n and 2908 \n\ncm\n-1\n\n bands, assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of CH2 \n\ngroups of the grafted alkyl chain, confirm the anchoring of the amino propyl groups, as \n\nwell as the presence of the 1631 cm\n-1\n\n and 1486 cm\n-1\n\n (the free and hydrogen bonding \n\nNH2, respectively), 800 cm\n-1\n (N-H bending mode), and 1448 cm\n\n-1\n (SiCH2) bands. \n\n \n\nThe following step was the chemical attachment of DTPA to the aminated NPs by \n\nthe formation of an amide linkage between the primary amine group and one of the five \n\ncarbonyl groups of DTPA. The occurrence of this chemical grafting was confirmed by \n\nthe DRIFT spectrum with the formation of four absorption bands: one band \n\ncharacteristic of the secondary amide C=O stretch at 1685 cm\n-1\n\n, two due to \n\nasymmetrically coupled vibration (1631 cm\n-1\n\n) and symmetrically coupled stretching \n\n(1396 cm\n-1\n\n) of the two C-O bonds of the carboxylate anion, and the fourth band is \n\ncharacteristic of the C-N vibration stretch at 937 cm\n-1\n\n (Figure 4.3). \n\n \n\nEvidence for the chelation of Ln\n3+\n\n (Ln= Gd, Eu, Tb) is also forthcoming from \n\nDRIFT spectroscopy.\n49\n\n Band assignments of the asymmetric and symmetric stretching \n\nvibrations of CH2 groups of the grafted alkyl chain (2977 cm\n-1\n\n, 2935 cm\n-1\n\n and 2900 cm\n-\n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n124 \n\n1\n) and the 1415 cm\n\n-1\n (hydrogen bonding NH2), 804 cm\n\n-1\n (N-H bending mode), and 1448 \n\ncm\n-1\n\n (SiCH2) were identified. The complexation of the Ln\n3+\n\n induced a slight \n\nbathochromic shift of the two CO absorption bands, from 1631 to 1579 cm\n-1\n\n and 1396 \n\nto 1415 cm\n-1\n\n respectively, and the secondary amide (C=O) 1680 to 1685 cm\n-1\n\n.

Information on the latter was, however, forthcoming from solid-state NMR. \n\nThe \n13\n\nC CP/MAS NMR spectra of the SiO2, SiO2@APS and SiO2@APS/DTPA \n\nNPs are shown in Figure 4.4 (see also Table 4.3). The spectrum of the SiO2 NPs \n\nreveals the presence of small amounts of ethanol (peaks at ca. 19 and 58 ppm). The \n\nspectrum of SiO2@APS displays three broad resonances, due to the Si-bonded propyl \n\nchains, at ca. 42 (C3), 22 (C2) and 9 ppm (C1).\n61 \n\nFinally, the spectrum of \n\nSiO2@APS/DTPA contains the three APS peaks as well as broad resonances in the \n\nranges 165-180 (carboxylate groups) and 50-65 ppm (remaining carbons) assigned to \n\nDTPA. Peaks from impurities are also present at ca. 25 ppm (acetic acid), 18 ppm \n\n(ethanol) and 30 ppm (acetone). \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 125 \n\nThe \n29\n\nSi CP/MAS and MAS NMR spectra of the derivatized NPs are shown in \n\nFigure 4.4B and C, respectively. The former exhibit resonances at ca. -92, -101 and -\n\n111 ppm, ascribed to Q\nn\n(4-n)(OH) local environments (\n\n29\nSi linked to n \n\n29\nSi atoms via \n\nbridging O), respectively Q\n2\n(2OH) (such as geminal silanols), Q\n\n3\n(OH) (single silanols) \n\nand Q\n4\n (siloxane).\n\n62\n The faint and broad resonance observed at ca. -66 ppm is \n\nascribed to the organosiloxane (T\n3\n) atoms R\u2019Si(OSi)3,\n\n51\n providing evidence for the \n\nchemical bonding of APS to the surface of the silica NPs. The presence of T\n2\n \n\nenvironments cannot be disregarded because the peak centred at -66 ppm is \n\nasymmetric, and may contain an unresolved resonance at ca. -60 ppm.\n63\n\n We note that \n\nseveral different T\n3\n sites are possible in the aminosilane layer, as discussed, for \n\nexample, in Albert et al.,\n63\n\n (Sheme 4.1 is, thus, just illustrative). Further evidence for \n\nsuch coupling is forthcoming from both the \n29\n\nSi CP/MAS and MAS NMR spectra \n\nbecause the number of NPs surface hydroxyl groups decreases upon derivatization \n\nwith APS: the population ratio (Q\n2\n+Q\n\n3\n)/Q\n\n4\n (measured from the MAS NMR spectrum) \n\ndecreases from 0.43 to 0.37. \n\nUpon reaction of SiO2@APS with DTPA, the number of silanol groups rises \n\nagain: (Q\n2\n+Q\n\n3\n)/Q\n\n4\n increases from 0.37 to 0.62. This is evidence for strong interactions \n\nbetween the amino group and silica surface silanols, when immobilized on silica gel via \n\nhydrogen-bonding interactions and formation of a five-membered cyclic intermediate. \n\nThese results confirm previous reports, which provided evidence for a cyclic structure \n\nof the aminosilane layer based on models of five- or six- membered rings in which the \n\nnitrogen atoms interact with either the Si atom or one of the SiOH groups.\n64,65\n\n The \n\nexistence of six-member ring models, containing either a SiO\n-\u2026.\n\nNH\n+\nH(R) or a \n\nSiOH\n\u2026.\n\nNH(R) bonding structure was also assumed using XPS results\n66,67 \n\nand FTIR and \n\nRaman spectroscopy.\n68\n\n  \n\nThe intensity of the T\n3\n (+T\n\n2\n) CP/MAS peak decreases upon addition of DTPA \n\n(although this must be taken with caution because the CP/MAS spectra are not a priori \n\nquantitative). These results indicate that the reaction of SiO2@APS with DPTA has the \n\nside effect of also modifying somewhat the SiO2 NPs surface. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n126 \n\nB C\n\n-60 -70 -90 -100 -110 -120 -130\n\n?

This temperature \n\ndependence supports the assignment of this new excitation band to a ligand-to-metal \n\ncharge transfer (LMCT) transition, resulting from the interaction between the host and \n\nthe Eu\n3+\n\n ions.\n73\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn order to get further insight into the Eu\n3+\n\n local coordination, the 4f\n6\n emission \n\nlines were recorded at high resolution (Figure 4.6c-e). The detection of a single \n\n5\nD0?\n\n7\nF0 line (17289.0\u00b11.5 cm\n\n-1\n) and the J-degeneracy splitting of the \n\n7\nF1,2 levels into \n\nthree Stark components, observed over the entire range of excitation wavelengths \n\nused, indicate that the Eu\n3+\n\n cations reside in a single low-symmetry site. The larger \n\nintensity of the electric-dipole \n5\nD0?\n\n7\nF2 transition, relative to the intensity of the \n\nmagnetic-dipole \n5\nD0?\n\n7\nF1 transition, indicates the absence of an inversion centre for the \n\nEu\n3+\n\n site. \n\n \n\nThe calculated value of the \n5\nD0?\n\n7\nF0 fwhm, ?59 cm\n\n-1\n, is much larger than the \n\nvalues (20-30 cm\n-1\n\n)\n74\n\n reported for other organic-inorganic hybrids, suggesting for the \n\nEu\n3+\n\n ions a large distribution of similar local sites. The room-temperature \n5\nD0 emission \n\ndecay curve, monitored within the \n5\nD0?\n\n7\nF2 transition at 614 nm and excited at 393 nm, \n\nis well fitted by a single exponential function, yielding a \n5\nD0 lifetime of 0.35\u00b10.02 ms \n\n(Figure 4.12). The slight deviation from a mono-exponential of the decay curve is in \n\nagreement with the aforementioned large distribution of the Eu\n3+\n\n ions in similar local \n\nsites. Therefore, a decrease in the lifetime relative to the non-grafted monomeric \n\ncomplex [Eu(DTPA)]\n2-\n (structure already well characterized and studied\n\n75\n) is observed \n\ndue to changes in the local environment of the Eu\n3+\n\n ion. \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 137 \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\ns\nit\ny\n (\n\na\nrb\n\n. \nu\n\nn\nit\ns\n)\n\n  \n\n \n\nTime (ms)\n \n\nFigure 4.12.

The arguments are as follows. \n\nFigure 4.25 compares the emission and excitation spectra of the free [Eu(PMN)] \n\ncomplex and SiO2@APS/ PMN:Eu NPs. The \n5\nD0?\n\n7\nF0 line of the latter can be fitted by \n\ntwo Gaussian bands, at ca. 578 and 580 nm (inset in Figure 4.25), in accord with the \n\nexistence of two distinct Eu\n3+\n\n local environments. Whereas the low-energy-component \n\n(ca. 578 nm) is ascribed to a Eu\n3+\n\n site with a coordination shell similar to that of the free \n\n[Eu(PMN)] complex, the high-energy band (ca. 580 nm), not present in the complex, \n\nmust correspond to a Eu\n3+\n\n coordination shell involving directly the SiO2@APS host. \n\nTherefore the excitation spectra monitored on both components provide information on \n\nthe nature of the two distinct local sites. Figure 4.26 compares the excitation spectra of \n\nthe SiO2@APS/PMN:Eu NPs, monitored at 578.0, 580.0 and 614.0 nm, and [Eu(PMN)] \n\ncomplex, monitored at 614.0 nm. While the spectra monitored at 580.0 nm and that of \n\nthe free complex are similar (Figure 4.26), the spectrum monitored at 578.0 nm shows, \n\nin addition, a broad band (\u2018pedestal\u2019) between 350.0 and 425.0. This band is, thus, \n\nassigned to the SiO2@APS host (Figure 4.18b and Figure 4.19).

The longer lifetime of SiO2@APS/PMN:Eu \n\nrelatively to lifetime of the free [Eu(PMN)] complex may be due to differences in the \n\nEu\n3+\n\n coordination spheres, in particular, brought about by the peptoidic coupling of \n\nPMN to APS in the former. \n\nThe maximum emission absolute quantum yields of the free [Eu(PMN)] complex \n\nand SiO2@APS/PMN:Eu NPs (measured at 270.5 nm) were, respectively, 0.04 ? 0.01 \n\nand 0.05 ? 0.01.

Relaxivity Properties \n\n \n\n \n\nSiO2@APS/DTPA:Ln NPs \n\n \n\n \n\nThe SiO2@APS/DTPA:Ln (Ln= Gd, Eu:Gd (1:1), Tb:Gd (1:1) NPs suspensions \n\nremained stable throughout the NMR measurements, allowing the collection of \n\nconsistent relaxation data. Table 4.4 shows the proton relaxivity values (r1p and r2p), \n\ndetermined at two frequencies (20 MHz and 500 MHz) and two temperatures (25 \u00baC \n\nand 37 \u00baC) for the SiO2@APS/DTPA:Gd, SiO2@APS/DTPA:EuGd (1:1) and \n\nSiO2@APS/DTPA:TbGd (1:1) water suspensions. These relaxivities were calculated \n\nfrom the observed linear dependence of the )2,1(,/1 ?? iTR\nii\n\n relaxation rates on the \n\nconcentration of the Gd\n3+\n\n ions present in all samples, shown in Figure 4.30 to Figure \n\n4.33. These values are constant over a large pH range, indicating that the \n\nparamagnetic NPs are stable and do not leach out Gd\n3+\n\n, Eu\n3+\n\n or Tb\n3+\n\n ions, even in \n\nhighly basic conditions. The )2,1( ?? ir\nip\n\n values measured for the \n\nSiO2@APS/DTPA:Gd nanoparticles with 67 nm diameter are very similar to those \n\nreported for the monomeric [Gd(DTPA)]\n2-\n\n complex,\n8\n reflecting the virtually free \n\nrotational motion of the complex at the surface of the nanoparticles, which counteracts \n\nthe effect of the slow global motion of the nanoparticle on the relaxivities. The \n\np\nr\n1\n\nvalues decrease with increasing frequency, as expected for the standard inner-\n\nsphere and outer-sphere dipolar mechanisms of proton relaxation. They are also \n\nalmost constant with increasing temperature, reflecting that the \n1\n\nT  relaxation process is \n\nlimited by slow-to-intermediate water exchange, characteristic of DTPA-amide \n\nsystems.\n8,9\n\n These r1p values are similar to those reported for nanoporous silica \n\nnanoparticles coated with covalently bound Gd-Si-DTPA\n30\n\n or Si-EDTA\n46\n\n derivatives, but \n\nsmaller than when a Si-DTTA\n30\n\n derivative was used (H4DTTA = \n\ndiethylenetriaminetetraacetic acid), mainly reflecting the different water accessibilities \n\nof the Gd\n3+\n\n ion in those systems. This water accessibility is much increased in \n\nmesoporous silica-based nanosystems covalently labelled with Gd-DTPA, Gd-DTTA or \n\nGd-DOTA derivatives,\n40-45\n\n leading to r1p values 5 to 10 times larger than for the \n\ncorresponding monomeric complexes. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n152 \n\nFor the SiO2@APS/DTPA:GdEu and SiO2@APS/DTPA:GdTb NPs, where 50% of \n\nthe DTPA-coordinated Gd\n3+\n\n ions are replaced by Eu\n3+\n\n or Tb\n3+\n\n, the r1p values (referred \n\nto one mM Gd\n3+\n\n) increase relative to the SiO2@APS/DTPA:Gd NPs (Table 4.4), \n\nreflecting the dipolar relaxation effect of the extra ions at the particle surface. This \n\nincrease is larger for the Tb\n3+\n\n than for Eu\n3+\n\n ions, as the former induces stronger \n1\n\nT  \n\nrelaxation due to its slower electronic relaxation. The frequency and temperature \n\ndependence of r1p for the mixed cation nanoparticles is the same as for the Gd\n3+ \n\nones. \n\n \n\nThe r2p values for the SiO2@APS/DTPA:Gd NPs undergo a large increase when \n\nthe measuring frequency increases (Table 4.4). Large r2p values have also been \n\nobserved for silica nanosystems covalently labelled with Gd\n3+\n\n complexes, particularly at \n\nhigh frequencies.\n30,40-42,45-47\n\n This indicates that the \n2\n\nT -relaxation process, besides the \n\ndipolar mechanism operating for \n1\n\nT -relaxation, also has a strong outer-sphere \n\ncontribution from field inhomogeneities created by the magnetized particles that the \n\nwater protons experience (measured by the frequency shift at the particle surface, ??) \n\nas they diffuse nearby (with a diffusion correlation time ?D), and which increase with the \n\nsquare of the external magnetic field strength.\n80\n\n The presence of this contribution is \n\nconfirmed by the increase of \np\n\nr\n2\n\n values observed for the mixed SiO2@APS/DTPA: \n\nEuGd NPs (Table 4.4). This magnetic susceptibility effect is particularly strong for \np\n\nr\n2\n\n \n\nvalues at 500 MHz, and can also be observed for the 20 MHz \np\n\nr\n2\n\n values of the mixed \n\nSiO2@APS/DTPA: TbGd NPs. These effects of the nanoparticle-bound Tb\n3+ \n\nions are \n\nstronger than those observed for the Eu\n3+\n\n ions, in agreement with the larger magnetic \n\nmoment of Tb\n3+\n\n.\n \nHowever, their 500 MHz \n\np\nr\n\n2\n values decrease, rather than increase, \n\nwhen 50% of the Gd\n3+\n\n ions are replaced by Tb\n3+\n\n (Table 4.4). This may reflect a \n\nbreakdown of the outer-sphere relaxation model for \n2\n\nT -relaxation at high magnetic field \n\ndue to the presence of the Tb\n3+\n\n ions, when ?D >> 1/ ??.

In these conditions, the static dephasing regime \n\n(SDR) model describes the transverse relaxation and the value of r2 becomes \n\ndependent on the time interval between two consecutive refocusing pulses (?CP) in the \n\ntrain of 180\no\n pulses applied in a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence.\n\n42 \n\nIn fact, preliminary experiments showed that the \n2\n\nr  of suspensions of these particles \n\ndepend on ?CP (data not shown), as expected in those conditions. \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\na-I\n\na-III\n\na-II\n\n  \n\n \n\nConcentration [Gd3+] (mM)\n\nb-I\n\n \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n \n\n \n\n \n\nR\n1\n (\ns\n-1\n\n)\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\nSlope=2.699  ???????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nSlope=4.137  ???????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\nSlope=7.95  ??????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nSlope=4.386  ???????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\nSlope=2.830  ???????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\nSlope=8.493  ???????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\nb-III\n\nb-II\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.34. r1 values measured at 20 MHz; (a) 25\u00baC and (b) 37\u00baC and \n\nsamples I- SiO2@APS/PMN:Gd; II- SiO2@APS/PMN:EuGd; (1:1) and       \n\nIII- SiO2@APS/PMN:TbGd (1:1). \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n158 \n\n0 1 2 3 4\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\na-I\n\na-III\n\na-II\n\n  \n\n \n\nConcentration [Gd3+] (mM)\n\nb-I\n\n \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n \n\n \n\n \n\nR\n2\n (\ns\n-1\n\n)\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSlope=4.323 + 0.002\n\nR\n2\n=0.97687\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nSlope=7.503  + 0.003\n\nR\n2\n=0.99661\n\nSlope=12.397  + 0.003\n\nR\n2\n=0.98978\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nSlope=7.679 + 0.002\n\nR\n2\n=0.99695\n\nSlope=4.025  + 0.002\n\nR\n2\n=0.99677\n\nSlope=11.985  + 0.006\n\nR\n2\n=0.99677\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\nb-III\n\nb-II\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.35. r2 values measured at 20 MHz; (a) 25\u00baC and (b) 37\u00baC and \n\nsamples I- SiO2@APS/PMN:Gd; II- SiO2@APS/PMN:EuGd; (1:1) and       \n\nIII- SiO2@APS/PMN:TbGd (1:1). \n\n0 1 2 3 4\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n  \n\n \n\nConcentration [Gd3+] (mM)\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nSlope=1.10  ??????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\nSlope=1.05  ??????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\nSlope=2.13  ??????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\nSlope=2.26  ??????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nR\n1\n (\ns\n-1\n\n)\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nSlope=2.13  ??????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nSlope=1.91  ??????\n\nR\n?\n????????\n\nb-III\n\nb-II\n\nb-I\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\na-III\n\na-I\n\na-II\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.36. r1 values measured at 500 MHz; (a) 25\u00baC and (b) 37\u00baC and \n\nsamples I- SiO2@APS/PMN:Gd; II- SiO2@APS/PMN:EuGd; (1:1) and       \n\nIII- SiO2@APS/PMN:TbGd (1:1). \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 159 \n\n0 1 2 3 4\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n  \n\n \n\nConcentration [Gd3+] (mM)\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\nSlope= 56.4  + 0.8\n\nR\n2\n=0.96426\n\nSlope= 80  + 1\n\nR\n2\n=0.98537\n\nSlope= 79.4  + 0.9\n\nR\n2\n=0.97588\n\nSlope= 89.9  + 0.8\n\nR\n2\n=0.99837\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nR\n2\n (\ns\n-1\n\n)\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nSlope= 227  + 4\n\nR\n2\n=0.95496\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\nSlope= 174 + 2\n\nR\n2\n=0.97877\n\nb-III\n\nb-II\n\nb-I\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\na-III\n\na-I\n\na-II\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.37. r2 values measured at 500 MHz; (a) 25\u00baC and (b) 37\u00baC and \n\nsamples I- SiO2@APS/PMN:Gd; II- SiO2@APS/PMN:EuGd; (1:1) and       \n\nIII- SiO2@APS/PMN:TbGd (1:1). \n\n \n\n4.3.4.

A clear increase in the \n\nintensity of the pellets (positive contrast), obtained with cells incubated with \n\nSiO2@APS/DTPA:EuGd NPs (sample III), is observed relative to the pellets \n\ncorresponding to unexposed cells (sample I), as opposed to the strong negative \n\ncontrast caused by internalization of the \n2\n\nT -shortening Fe2O3 NPs (sample II). The \n\noptical features of the NPs internalized cells were also assessed at a wavelength of \n\n393 nm. The results illustrated in Figure 4.38b demonstrate that the fluorescence of \n\nsample II is a combination of the autofluorescence of cells and the fluorescence \n\nexhibited by the SiO2@APS/DTPA:EuGd NPs (violet is the combination of red and \n\n\n\n \n\nLanthanide-chelate Grafted Silica Nanoparticles as Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n160 \n\nblue).

INTRODUCTION \n\n \n\n \n\nNanoparticles (NPs) made of inorganic or organic materials exhibit many novel \n\nproperties compared with the bulk materials.\n1\n Magnetic NPs have unique properties \n\nsuch as superparamagnetism, high coercivity, low Curie temperature, high magnetic \n\nsusceptibility, etc.\n2\n Magnetic NPs are of great interest in a broad range of disciplines, \n\nfrom magnetic fluids to data storage, catalysis,\n3\n and bio-applications.\n\n4\n Examples of \n\napplications of NPs in the study of biology and biomedicine are magnetic \n\nbioseparation,\n5\n cell sorting,\n\n67\n detection of biological entities,\n\n8\n clinical diagnosis and \n\ntherapy (such as MRI, magnetic resonance imaging),\n9-18\n\nMFH (magnetic fluid \n\nhyperthermia)\n19\n\n targeted drug delivery,\n20-23\n\n immunoassays,\n24\n\n and biomacromolecule \n\npurification.\n25\n\n Magnetic iron oxide NPs play an important role in these applications and \n\nthey have been used in in vitro diagnosis for about 50 years.\n26 \n\nIn the last decade, \n\nnumerous investigations have been carried out in the field of magnetic NPs,\n27\n\nespecially \n\non magnetite and maghemite due to their biocompatibility, FDA approval\n28 \n\nand absence \n\nof toxicity.\n29-31\n\n \n\n \n\nThe control of the NPs size, shape, stability, and dispersibility in specific solvents \n\nis a technological challenge. Bio-applications, for example, require water-solubility and \n\ncolloidal stability. However, most reported syntheses of high-quality NPs of metals,\n32,33 \n\nsemiconductors,\n34,35 \n\nand metal oxides\n36-38\n\n involve non-aqueous solvents and coating \n\nwith monolayers of hydrophobic surfactants. Several strategies to tackle these \n\n\n\n \nCore-shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 173 \n\nchallenges have been formulated,\n39 \n\nsuch as i) polymer coating,\n40,41 \n\nii) exchanging the \n\noriginal hydrophobic stabilizer with dendrons,\n42,43\n\n thiols or even oligomeric \n\nphosphines\n44 \n\nand iii) silica coatings.\n45-53    9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18 19\n\n,\n20,21,22,23242526\n\n \n27\n\n \n28\n\n \n\n29\n,\n30\n\n,\n3132\n\n,\n33\n\n \n34\n\n,\n35\n\n \n36\n\n,\n37\n\n,\n38\n\n \n39\n\n \n40\n\n,\n41\n\n \n42,4344\n\n \n45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53\n\n \n\nIn order to expand the scope of the iron oxide NPs in biological applications, \n\nbiomolecules have been employed as coatings, such as amino acids,\n54\n\n vitamins,\n55,56\n\n \n\nproteins,\n57\n\n antibodies,\n58,59\n\n polypeptides,\n60\n\n biotin, avidin\n61\n\n and saccharides.\n62\n\n However, \n\nsilica coating remains one of the most popular and well-known techniques for NP \n\nsurface modification, because the resulting cross-linked silica shell protects the core \n\nfrom the environment and the other way around. The silica coating also provides \n\ncolloidal stability in biological solutions by avoiding inter-particle interactions and \n\nagglomeration. Furthermore, it can act as an anchor for the binding of biological \n\nvectors at the NPs surface.\n63\n\n Although there are several publications concerning silica \n\ncoatings, only a few methods have been reported for the preparation of water-soluble \n\nsilica-coated NPs with a high colloidal stability and with sizes below 20 nm.\n45,50,53\n\n \n\nParticles with tunable size are important when considering biomedical \n\napplications. While small NPs exhibit reduced nonspecific interactions, minimal steric \n\neffects, and high clearance rates,\n64\n\n larger NPs are subjected to internalization by \n\nmacrophages. The thickness of the silica shell has also a strong influence on the \n\nphysical properties of the NPs, especially in terms of contrast agent efficacy for \n\nmagnetic resonance imaging. We describe the synthesis of ?-Fe2O3@SiO2, core-shell \n\nNPs with tuned shell thicknesses. These particles were characterized by Transmission \n\nElectron Microscopy (TEM), zeta potential determinations, Diffuse Reflectance Infrared \n\nFourier-Transform and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance. The longitudinal (T1) and \n\ntransversal (T2) relaxation times of aqueous suspensions of the prepared particles were \n\nmeasured, and their cytotoxicity was investigated. We show that the shell thickness of \n\n?-Fe2O3@SiO2 NPs has a significant impact on their relaxivities. This silica layer \n\nexhibits two regions around the core, one, which is porous to water, and a second one, \n\nwhich is not. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCore-Shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n174 \n\n5.2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES \n\n \n\n \n\nMaterials and purification methods \n\n \n\nIron (III) chloride hexahydrate (98%), iron (II) chloride tetrahydrate (99%), iron (III) \n\nnitrate nonahydrate (99%), tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) (98%), and citric acid (99.5%) \n\nwere purchased from Aldrich. Absolute ethanol (J.T. Baker) and ammonia (Carlo Erba) \n\nwere used as received. All other reagents were of analytical grade. All the experiments \n\nwere performed in deionized Milli-Q water. \n\n \n\n \n\nPreparation of the maghemite ferrofluid suspension \n\n \n\nThe aqueous maghemite suspension was synthesized by precipitation from iron \n\nchlorides.\n65,66\n\n Briefly, the Fe3O4 precipitate (black dispersion of magnetite), obtained by \n\nalkalinization of the FeCl2 and FeCl3 (Fe\n2+\n\n/Fe\n3+\n\n = 1/2) aqueous mixture, was \n\nsuccessively oxidized with 2M HNO3 and 0.33 M Fe(NO3)3 \u00b7 9H2O solutions at 100 \u00baC \n\nin order to obtain particles with a Fe\n2+\n\n/Fe\n3+\n\n ratio lower than 0.05. With this oxidation \n\nprocess, magnetite is converted into maghemite. The brown dispersion was peptized in \n\na 2 M HNO3 solution under vigorous stirring in order to create positive surface charges. \n\nThe acidic precipitate was isolated by magnetic separation, washed with acetone and \n\ndispersed at pH ~ 2.5 in water with nitric acid. The iron concentration was determined \n\nby volumetric titration as well as by ICP measurements and the average particle size, \n\nas determined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), was 10 ? 2 nm  \n\n \n\nPreparation of the maghemite ferrofluid core-shell suspension \n\n \n\nThe selected method was derived from the so-called St\u00f6ber process\n67\n\n widely \n\nused for the synthesis of silica beads with diameters from a few tens to a few hundreds \n\nof nanometers.\n68\n\n It is based on the hydrolysis/condensation of tetraethoxysilane \n\n(TEOS) catalyzed by ammonia in alcoholic media. The surface of ?-Fe2O3 NPs was \n\nactivated by acidic treatment: where 7.55 mL of ?-Fe2O3 colloidal suspension \n\n(concentration 74.4 g/L) were dispersed in 40 mL of 0.01 M citric acid. They were \n\n\n\n \nCore-shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 175 \n\nisolated by decantation on a magnet. The particles were dispersed in 12 mL of water \n\nand peptization was performed by adding 20 \u00b5L of ammonia. Then, the alkaline sol of \n\ncitrated- ?-Fe2O3 NPs was poured in 1 L of ethanol-water-ammonia solution 75/23.5/1.5 \n\nv/v/v %, to obtained a 0.561 g/L concentration. The appropriate amounts of TEOS \n\nprecursors were added to the dispersion under mild stirring to reach the targeted shell \n\nthickness. They were set to comply with the desired thickness of the silica shell \n\naccording to equation 5.1 and added in multiple steps. \n\n \n\n? ?? ?33\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\nrer\n\nM\n\nM\nNV\n\nshell\n\nSiOTEOS\n\nTEOSSiO\nPartTEOS\n\n???\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n (5.1) \n\n \n\nWhere \nshell\n\ne is the shell thickness (the difference ? ?? ?33\n3\n\n4\nrer\n\nshell\n???  then corresponding \n\nto the volume of the silica shell ? ?\n22\n\n,\nSiOSiO\n\nV ?  is the density and \n2SiO\n\nM  the molecular \n\nweight of SiO2; TEOSTEOSTEOS MV ,, ?  are the volume, density and molecular weight of \n\nTEOS; Npart. is the number of ?-Fe2O3 NPs. The very first amount of added TEOS (763 \n\n?L) corresponds to the smallest observable silica shell thickness (roughly 1 nm). Then, \n\nafter 12h of the reaction, 200 mL of this solution were stocked for analysis and \n\nreplaced by the same amount of reaction medium. For the following step, the resulting \n\nsolution was added with the necessary amount of TEOS to increase the shell \n\nthickness, and left to react another 12h. 200 mL of this solution were also stocked for \n\nanalysis and replaced by the same amount of reaction medium. This procedure was \n\nused to get thicker shell sizes (the number of particles in each volume being \n\nrecalculated to estimate the right amount of TEOS). Under these conditions, no \n\nsecondary nucleation was observed, which is in agreement with the results reported by \n\nChen et al.\n69\n\n Two series of core shell NPs were synthesised and will be denoted series \n\nA and B. The difference between these two series was size of the NPs, in series B a \n\nbetter range of thinner coating was produced in order to better understand the \n\ninfluence of the silica shell. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCore-Shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n176 \n\nParticle characterization \n\n \n\nTEM was performed at room temperature on a JEOL JEM-2000 FX transmission \n\nelectron microscope using an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Drops of diluted \n\ndispersions of core-shell were air-dried on carbon films deposited on 200-mesh copper \n\ngrids. The excess liquid was blotted with filter paper. The Diffuse Reflectance Infrared \n\nFourier-Transform (DRIFT) spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS Equinox 55FTIR \n\nspectrometer (signal averaging 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm\n-1\n\n in KBr pellets \n\ncontaining ca. 2 mass % of material). The zeta potential of the NPs was assessed \n\nusing a Zetasizer 3000HSA setup (Malvern Instruments) equipped with a He- Ne laser \n\n(50 mW, 532 nm). The zeta potential measurement based on laser Doppler \n\ninterferometry was used to measure the electrophoretic mobility of NPs. Measurements \n\nwere performed for 20s using a standard capillary electrophoresis cell. The dielectric \n\nconstant was set to 80.4 and the Smoluchowsky constant f(ka) was 1.5. The iron \n\ncontent has been measured by inductively coupled plasma / optical emission \n\nspectrometry ICP/OES (ES720, Varian) equipped with a crossflow nebulizer. A 1 g/L \n\niron solution was used to prepare the standard solutions (SCP Science to Paris) and \n\nwas used as internal standard to evaluate the instrumental drift. \n\n \n\n \n\nMeasurements of water proton longitudinal and transverse relaxation times (\n1\n\nT  \n\nand \n2\n\nT  respectively) of aqueous suspensions of the NPs were carried out at 20 MHz \n\non a Bruker Minispec mq20 relaxometer and at 499.83 MHz (B0= 11.7 T) on a Varian \n\nUnity 500 NMR spectrometer at 25 \u00baC. The \n1\n\nT  relaxation times were measured using \n\nthe inversion recovery pulse sequence, while the \n2\n\nT  relaxation times were measured \n\nusing a Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) pulse sequence and varying the time \n\ninterval between two consecutive refocusing pulses (\nCP\n\n? ) in the train of 180\no\n pulses \n\napplied. The values of \n*\n\n2\nT , the transverse relaxation time in the presence local field \n\ninhomogeneities, were obtained from the water spectral line widths. All the \n\nexperimental values were corrected for the diamagnetic contribution using aqueous \n\nsuspensions of hollow silica NPs, to obtain each paramagnetic contribution. These \n\nhollow shells where prepared by dilution of the core by addition of concentrated HCl. \n\nThe magnetization measurements were performed on a known amount of \n\nferrofluid using a vibrating sample magnetometer VSM-NUVO (MOLSPIN, Newcastle \n\n\n\n \nCore-shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 177 \n\nUpon Tyne, U.K.).  Magnetometry of NPs allows the determination of the saturation \n\nmagnetisation (Msat) and the radius of the superparamagnetic crystals (r) by fitting the \n\ndata with a Langevin function (\nx\n\nxxL\n1\n\n)coth()( ??  where \nTk\n\nB\nx\n\nb\n\nsat 0\n?\n\n? ) with \nsat\n\n?  as the \n\nmagnetic moment at saturation, B0 as the magnetic field, bk  as the Boltzmann constant \n\nand T as the temperature. \n\nThe NMRD profiles were recorded at 37 \u00b0C over a magnetic field range from 0.24 \n\nmT to 0.24 T on a field cycling Stelar relaxometer (Mede, Italy). Additional longitudinal \n\n(R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation rate measurements were performed at 0.47 and \n\n1.41 T on Minispec mq20 and Minispec mq60 relaxometers, respectively (Bruker, \n\nKarlsruhe, Germany). \n\n \n\n \n\nToxicity tests \n\n \n\nCytotoxicity of the ?-Fe2O3@SiO2 NPs was tested by counting the cells in a \n\nMalassez chamber and using the MTT assay to evaluate the cell viability after the NPs \n\npreparation process. The core-shell NPs FF, 1A, 2A, 5A and 7A had diameters ranging \n\nbetween 10 and 143 nm. Briefly, microglial cell lines were seeded at the rate of ca. 16 x \n\n10\n3\n cells/cm\n\n2\n in 35 mm diameter plates and allowed to attach for 24 h. The cells were \n\nthen incubated for 0, 45 min, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, 96 h, 120 h and 144 h in 1 mL of culture \n\nmedium for control cells and supplemented with 60 \u00b5L of different NPs (0.16 mM) for \n\ntreated cells. MTT and counting assays were performed as duplicate for each condition \n\nand the data were averaged. After incubation, cells were scraped from the dishes, then \n\nstained with trypan blue and counted with a haemocytometer. The MTT assay is a \n\ncolorimetric assay that measures the reduction of yellow 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-\n\n2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) by dehydrogenase mostly from mitochondria. \n\nThe MTT enters the cells and passes into the mitochondria, where it is reduced to an \n\ninsoluble, colored (dark purple) formazan product. After cell culturing in the presence of \n\nNPs, 260 ?L of the MTT solution in culture medium (0.5 mg/mL) was added into each \n\nwell. The plate was then incubated at 37 \u00baC in 5 % CO2 for 45 min. The medium was \n\nremoved and 1 mL of PBS solution was added, then cells were scraped and \n\ncentrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was removed and 1 mL of dimethyl \n\nsulfoxide (DMSO) was added to the pellets to dissolve the formazan crystals and then \n\nit was centrifuged again at 1000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were taken and their \n\n\n\n \nCore-Shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n178 \n\nabsorbance was measured with a U-2800A (UV-VIS) spectrophotometer (Hitachi, \n\nJapan) at 570 nm. Since reduction of MTT can only occur in metabolically active cells, \n\nthe level of activity is an estimation of the viability of the cells as compared to untreated \n\ncells. The cell viability (%) was calculated according to equation 5.2: \n\n \n\nCell viability % = OD570(sample) / OD570(control) \u00d7 100 (5.2) \n\n \n\nwhere OD570(sample) represents the optical density of the wells treated with various \n\niron sizes, and OD570(control) represents that of the wells treated with medium culture. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n5.3.1. Characterization of Nanoparticles \n\n \n\nThe aqueous maghemite suspension was synthesized by basic precipitation from \n\niron chlorides, followed by complete oxidation of the magnetite material. For the \n\ncoating, a polymerization of silane monomers in the presence of the NPs under St\u00f6ber \n\nconditions\n67,70\n\n was performed. This procedure is widely used since it provides uniform \n\nsilica coating with a controllable thickness. St\u00f6ber\u2019s conditions involve alcohol-water-\n\nammonia as the medium and tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) as the silane monomer. A pre-\n\nactivation of the surface of the NPs through acidic treatment was found to improve the \n\nsilica coating, leading to a simple and highly reproducible method for producing \n\nmonodispersed water-soluble stable colloidal NPs with silica shells whose thickness is \n\ntunable in the range 2-70 nm. \n\nTo tune the silica shell thickness, the required amount of TEOS was calculated \n\nfrom the initial and the desired final particle size,\n71\n\n,\n72\n\n taking into account the number of \n\n?-Fe2O3 NPs, Npart., by means of equation 5.1. \n\nThe estimated and experimental thicknesses of the silica coatings are collected in \n\nTable 5.1, while Figure 5.1 displays the TEM images obtained at various stages of the \n\nNPs synthesis for series A and B. \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCore-shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 179 \n\nTEM showed that spherical core-shell (?-Fe2O3@SiO2) NPs with different shell \n\nsizes were obtained; as clearly evidenced by these images, all the ?-Fe2O3 particles \n\nwere surrounded by the silica layer. The scheme on the right of the lower row of the \n\nimages defines the measured size or diameter (d) of the NPs, and their silica shell \n\nthickness (t). The average thickness of silica shells was determined from these images \n\nby measurements in four directions for each particle and at least 100 particles per ?-\n\nFe2O3@SiO2 sample, showing that the size dispersion of the particles is very small. \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 shows the relationship between the obtained shell thicknesses of the \n\nseries A NPs and the expected ones through calculations. They are proportional to the \n\namount of TEOS added during the preparation. Note the deviation from a slope of 1, \n\nwhich is significant of the errors taking place at each step as well as some aggregation \n\nof the maghemite particles, as can be detected by TEM. \n\n \n\nThe ratio of Fe/Si was determined for the series B NPs by ICP (Table 5.2). When \n\nthe diameter of the NPs increases, the concentration of Fe with respect to Si \n\ndecreases, as expected (Figure 5.3). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 5.1.

The shift of the IEP towards lower pH values (from ~6.5-7 to ~2.5) \n\nupon coating (Figure 5.4) provides an additional confirmation that the coating was \n\nsuccessful. The large negative zeta potential (- 80 mV) at physiological pH of the \n\ncoated NPs suggests that the aqueous suspensions will by highly stable under in vivo \n\nconditions and will not flocculate at pH 7. \n\nDRIFT spectroscopy was also used to probe the effectiveness of the chemical \n\ncoating of silica on the maghemite NPs (FF) (Figure 5.5). Several absorption bands in \n\nthe DRIFT spectrum of ?-Fe2O3@SiO2 samples (Figure 5.5) are assigned to silica; and \n\nclearly show that this material covers the surface of the maghemite NPs.

This decrease is initially quite sharp, from 32.0 s\n-1\n\nmM\n-1\n\n for NPs without silica \n\ncoating (d = 10.0 nm) to 11.2 s\n-1\n\nmM\n-1\n\n for d = 14 nm, while the r1 values become very \n\nsmall (&lt;2 s\n-1 \n\nmM\n-1\n\n) for d > 25 nm (Figure 5.5, inset). At 500 MHz, r1 values are very \n\nsmall in all cases, even in the absence of silica shell (Figure 5.5). \n\n \n\nFor superparamagnetic NPs, the relaxivities ri (i = 1, 2) are dominated by the \n\nouter-sphere relaxation mechanism, which is due to the effect of local magnetic field \n\ngradients generated by the NPs on the water protons diffusing near their surface.\n73 74\n\n \n\nTaking into account the effect of water diffusion through the non-fluctuating magnetic \n\nfield (B0) inhomogeneities created by the time-averaged value of the magnetic moment \n\n(<?z>) of the NPs aligned onto B0, and the effect of the fluctuation of the magnetic \n\nmoment itself (??z), a theoretical model was developed, where the r1 and r2 relaxivities \n\ncontain terms proportional to&lt;?z>\n2\n, which define the Curie relaxation\n\n75\n and dominate at \n\nhigh field, and fluctuating terms proportional to ??z\n2\n (N\u00e9el relaxation) that dominate at \n\nlow field.\n74,76 \n\nThis model accounts quite well for the magnetic field dependence of r1 for \n\nultra small particles of iron oxide (USPIO) (diameters of 10-40 nm) at high fields (B0 > \n\n0.02 T, corresponding to ~ 0.8 MHz Larmor frequency), where Curie relaxation \n\n\n\n \nCore-shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 187 \n\ndominates, but does not account for the small r1 dispersion observed at low field (below \n\n1 MHz), which depends on the crystal anisotropy energy.\n77\n\n Above 1 MHz, r1 depends \n\non the translational diffusion correlation time ?D and decreases with increase of the \n\nproton Larmor frequency ?I, with an inflection point defined by the condition ?I.?D ~ 1. ?D \n\n= rp\n2\n/D, where D is the relative diffusion coefficient of the paramagnetic center and the \n\nwater molecule and rp is the radius of the particle, which determines their distance of \n\nclosest approach. \n\n \n\nThe decrease of the r1 values at 20 MHz with the increase of the silica shell \n\nthickness reflects the decrease of the outer-sphere contribution of the core to r1 due to \n\nthe increase of the distance of closest approach of the diffusing bulk water molecules \n\nto the superparamagnetic core of the particle. This induces an increase of the \n\ntranslational diffusion correlation time, ?D. At least a large part of the silica layer is \n\nexpected to be impermeable to water. The relative diffusion coefficient D is expected to \n\nbe nearly constant for all NPs. Being the sum of the diffusion constants of water (DH2O) \n\nand of the NP (DNP), it is dominated by DH2O due to the large size of the NPs and the \n\nslow diffusion of water in the putative silica surface layer. The very small r1 values \n\nobtained at 500 MHz result from the expected field dependence of outer-sphere \n\nrelaxation. \n\n \n\nThe effective transverse relaxation rates (R2*) for the aqueous suspensions of the \n\n?-Fe2O3@SiO2 NPs were obtained from the spectral line widths of their proton water \n\nresonance. Values of R2p* (the paramagnetic contribution to R2*) were calculated by \n\nsubtraction of the diamagnetic contribution of aqueous suspensions of diamagnetic iron \n\noxide-free silica NPs from each paramagnetic contribution, using the spectral line \n\nwidths for the various samples. Finally, the corresponding relaxivities, r2*, were \n\nobtained (see Table 5.2). The line broadening effects reflect the dephasing of the water \n\nproton magnetic moments diffusing past the magnetic field gradients in the vicinity of \n\nthe small superparamagnetic NPs, causing their T2-shortening. \n\n \n\nThe transverse relaxation times are characterized by the correlation times ?D, \n\n(??)\n-1\n\n, and ?CP. The uncoated particles have a radius of 5 nm, from which it can be \n\ncalculated that for these particles ?D is 10\n-8\n\n s. From simulations reported by Gillis et \n\nal.,\n78\n\n the transverse relaxivity may be predicted by the outer sphere theory (eq. 5.3), \n\n\n\n \nCore-Shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n188 \n\nwhere ?? is the difference in the Larmor frequency at the particle surface and the \n\ninfinity and v is the volume fraction of the particles. \n\n \n\nD\nvrr ??\n\n2*\n\n22\n9\n\n4\n???  (5.3) \n\n \n\nUpon coating, both ?D and (??)\n-1\n\n will decrease and we assume that the outer \n\nsphere regime remains valid. \n\nThe r2 values were measured as a function of the time interval between two \n\nconsecutive 180\no\n pulses (?CP) in a CPMG pulse sequence, for aqueous suspensions of \n\nthe various NPs of increasing diameter. Figure 5.6 shows that the transverse \n\nrelaxivities of these NPs are virtually independent of ?CP for all silica shell sizes. This \n\nobservation is not surprising, since the ?D values of the systems measured are all much \n\nsmaller that the applied ?CP values and, consequently the refocusing pulses are fully \n\neffective. \n\n \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n \n\n  1A\n\n 2A\n\n 3A\n\n 4A\n\n 5A\n\n 6A\n\n 7A\n\nr 2\n (\n\ns\n-1\n\nm\nM\n\n-1\n)\n\n? cp (ms)\n \n\nFigure 5.6.

As \n\ndiscussed above for r1 effects, this results from the decrease of the outer-sphere \n\ncontribution of the core to r2 due to the increase of the distance of closest approach of \n\nthe diffusing bulk water molecules to the superparamagnetic core of the particle. \n\nData show that r2 ? r2* for the smallest particles (? -Fe2O3 NPs (core), 1A and 2A), \n\nbut r2 &lt;r2\n*\n for particles with thicker coatings. It is possible that for the thicker coatings \n\nthe silica layer is only impermeable to water up to a certain silica shell thickness. The \n\ndiffusion of the water molecules in the permeable silica layer may be relatively slow. If \n\nin this layer the diffusion is so slow that the condition ?D >> (??)\n-1\n\n holds, the diffusion \n\ncorrelation time is not effective when refocusing pulses are applied and, consequently, \n\nthe phase incoherence of the water protons is fully refocused in that part of the system, \n\nresulting in zero contribution to r2.

However, when the coating becomes very thick, the \n\ndiamagnetic contribution of the silica cannot be neglected in the fitting of the NMRD \n\nprofile. This contribution must be added to that of the magnetic particles alone. As \n\nshown by Roose et al.,\n85\n\n the NMRD profile of such large diamagnetic particles is \n\ncharacterized by dispersion at very low fields. \n\nFor this reason the central region of the NMRD profiles of the particles covered \n\nwith the thickest layers of silica (see samples FF@SiO2_4B, FF@SiO2_5B, \n\nFF@SiO2_6B, FF@SiO2_7B) are fitted \u201cby eye\u201d with the superparamagnetic relaxation \n\n(between 0.5 and 10MHz). A better fit could be obtained after subtraction of the \n\ndiamagnetic contribution of the silica. The values of the parameters obtained by fitting \n\nthe NMRD profiles are presented in Table 5.5 together with those obtained by TEM and \n\nmagnetometry. \n\n\n\n \nCore-Shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n196 \n\n \n\nA good linear relationship is obtained between the NPs sizes measured by \n\nelectron microscopy and those obtained by fitting the NMRD profiles (Figure 5.9 and \n\nTable 5.5). Importantly, the sizes obtained by NMRD for particles coated with a thick \n\nlayer of silica are significantly lower than those measured by transmission electron \n\nmicroscopy, indicating that a significant part of the silica coating is permeable to water. \n\nIndeed, the effective distance of closest approach of the water protons to the \n\nsuperparamagnetic core, as determined by equation 1, is shorter than the NPs \n\nthickness as given by TEM, in agreement with what was proposed before for these \n\nsystems.\n82\n\n \n\nInterestingly, the magnetization Msat expressed relatively to the global weight of \n\nthe particles, and obtained from the relaxometric data decreases significantly for the \n\nlarger particles (Table 5.5). A correlation can be drawn between the values of Msat \n\nobtained by both magnetometry (which gives the value of the magnetization of the \n\ncrystal itself) and relaxometry (which gives the value of the magnetization of \u201cthe\u201d \n\nparticle, i.e. the crystal plus the coating). Assuming a waterproof coating, such a \n\ncorrelation is achieved by multiplying the former one by the factor in eq. 5.12: \n\n \n\n)(2.290.4\n\n90.4\n333\n\n3\n\nbpcoatbp\n\nbpbp\n\ns\n\ncoat\n\ns\nddd\n\nd\nMM\n\n????\n\n?\n?

The Msat values of \n\nTable 5.5 show that, by covering the magnetic crystal and \u201cexpelling\u201d the water further \n\nand further away from it creates bigger and bigger particles of the same \u201cmagnetic \n\ncontent\u201d, so behaving like larger but less magnetized particles. However, the fact that \n\nthe magnetization dilution of the core-shell NPs measured by NMRD is significantly \n\nsmaller than that predicted from eq.5.12 clearly indicates again that the silica shell is \n\nnot waterproof, but is partly water permeable.\n \nThis observation is of paramount \n\nimportance in the context of the development of contrastophores for molecular imaging. \n\n\n\n \nCore-shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 197 \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\nSlope= 0.31 \u00b1 0.04\n\nR\n2\n= 0.966\n\n \n\n \n\nN\nM\n\nR\nD\n\n d\nia\n\nm\ne\n\nte\nr\n\nTEM diameter\n\n \n\nFigure 5.19: Comparison between the NPs diameter obtained by NMRD \n\nfitting and TEM. \n\n \n\nTable 5.5: Parameters obtained for the NPs samples by different \n\ntechniques. \n\nSample number TEM \ndiameter  \n\n(nm) \n\nMagnetome\ntric \n\ndiameter \n\n(nm) \n\nNMRD \ndiameter \n(nm) \n\nMsat Crystal \n\nMagnetometry \n\n(Am\n2\n/kg of iron \n\noxide) \n\nMeasured Msat \n\nNMRD \n\n(Am\n2\n/kg          \n\nof particle) \n\nCalculated Msat \n\nNMRD \n\n(Am\n2\n/kg           \n\nof particle)\na\n \n\nCalculated Msat \n\nTEM \n\n(Am\n2\n/kg           \n\nof particle)\nb\n \n\nFF 9.6 11.0 13.6 62.1 51.1 51.1 51.1 \n\nFF@SiO2_1B 11.2   11.4 16.2 55.7 47.9 39.0 40.4 \n\nFF@SiO2_2B 24.7  11.0 21.4 58.4 39.0 22.2 6.2 \n\nFF@SiO2_3B 46.4 11.2 27.6 57.4 23.9 11.9 1.00 \n\nFF@SiO2_4B 73.8 11.2 40.0 56.2 12.3 4.3 0.25 \n\nFF@SiO2_5B 94.9  11.2 43.4 55.4 8.2 3.4 0.12 \n\nFF@SiO2_6B 114.2 11.2 43.0  55.9 6.4 3.5 0.07 \n\nFF@SiO2_7B 152.9 11.2 61.6  57.8 5.1 1.2 0.03 \n\na,b\n Calculated from equation [5.12] using \n\na\nNMRD diameters and \n\nb\nTEM diameters. \n\n\n\n \nCore-Shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n198 \n\n \n\nThe conditions under which the equations for outer sphere relaxation are valid \n\nstill have to be discussed. This formalism is based on a small perturbation theory. By \n\nsimulation, Gillis and al.\n78\n\n have shown that for magnetite particles without diamagnetic \n\ncoating, the results of the outer sphere theory are valid when ?D is shorter than 10\n-7\n\ns. If \n\nthe measurement is made at 37 \u00b0C (D = 3.10\n-9\n\n m\n2\ns\n\n-1\n), the diameter should, thus, be \n\nsmaller than 30 nm. In the same work, the authors also showed that the conditions of \n\napplication of the outer sphere theory are fixed by the condition (??)r.?D&lt;1, where (??)r  \n\nis the chemical shift between the proton in the equatorial plane of the particle and the \n\nbulk proton.  For bare particles, the value of this product is 0.45. The variation of the \n\nvalue of (??)r.?D with the thickness of the coating is related to the equatorial magnetic \n\nfield of the particle which is given by: \n\n \n\n3\n\n3\n\ncoat\n\nbpbp\n\neq\n\ncoat\n\neq\nd\n\nd\nBB ?  (5.13) \n\nwhere \ncoat\n\neq\nB  is the equatorial magnetic field of the coated particle and \n\nbp\n\neq\nB  is the \n\nequatorial magnetic field of the bare particle. \n\n \n\nAs ? ?\neqr\n\nB???? ??\n5\n\n4\n (Beq being the equatorial field of the crystal and ? the \n\nproton gyromagnetic ratio), the ratio between the product [(??)r.?D ]coat of coated particle \n\nand the product [(??)r.?D ]bp for bare particle is given by \n\n \n\n \n\n? ?? ?\n? ?? ?\n\ncoat\n\nbp\n\nbpDr\n\ncoatDr\n\nd\n\nd\n?\n\n??\n\n??\n\n??\n\n??\n (5.14) \n\n \n\nThus, although the overall size of the NPs increases, the conditions for \n\napplication of the outer sphere theory become more and more favorable for thicker \n\n\n\n \nCore-shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 199 \n\ncoatings because the dependence on the diameter is cubic for (??) and of power one \n\nfor ?D. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.3.3.

Variation of total activity, and b) activity per million of cells of \n\nmitochondrial dehydrogenase of microglial cells as given by the variation of \n\nthe solubilized formazan optical density of the medium with incubation times \n\nfor different sizes of NPs after incubation without (control cells) and with \n\nboth coated and uncoated particles of different sizes (cells + NPs). \n\n\n\n \nCore-shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 201 \n\nBoth coated and uncoated particles induce an optical density of the cells, which \n\nvaries with the incubation time with a maximum value for 120 h, following the same \n\nbehaviour as that of the control cells. Like the cell growth in the preceding experiment, \n\nthe dehydrogenase activity is not affected by NPs internalization in the cells from FF to \n\n5A. In these experiments, the crude analysis of the dehydrogenase activity is relevant \n\nfor the cell viability, but is not enough to give information about modifications of the cell \n\nphenotype. However, the dehydrogenase activity is drastically modified for the larger \n\nparticles (e.g. 7A). Such NPs are known to be internalized and stored in lysosome-like \n\nvesicles. In case of NPs 7A, the consequences of their accumulation inside such cells \n\nable to phagocytise particles larger than 100 nm are still unknown. Their impact on the \n\nlocal changes in the overall redox potential due to the high load of iron in the vesicles is \n\nstill an open question. We also normalized the activity per cell as a variation of the \n\noptical density per million cells as shown in Figure 5.21b. This allows all along the time \n\nof culture, the characterization of the cell growth on the dehydrogenase expression and \n\nthe possible contribution of the NPs uptake during the growth time. The growth of \n\ncontrol cells shows a basal level decreasing until 24 h that correlates with the lag \n\nphase of growth. Then the expression of the dehydrogenase per cell increases in two \n\nmajor steps, the first one between 48 h and 72 h, and the second one between 96 h \n\nand 144 h. After this period of time, the cells are nearly confluent. When the cells are \n\nincubated with NPs, the activity per cell is not significantly affected except for sample \n\n7A after 144 h of exposure. Therefore, one can safely assume that in these conditions, \n\nthe dehydrogenase expression does not appear to be sensitive to the vesicular load \n\nwith these core-shell NPs. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.4.  CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe understanding of the relationship between the coating properties and the \n\nchanges in relaxivity is vital for designing magnetic NP probes for MRI. This is \n\nimportant for medical applications, as a higher contrast typically leads to a higher \n\nsensitivity and reduces the amount of contrast agent required for imaging. Our choice \n\nof a silica coating was motivated by the increased stability of the resulting NP \n\nsuspensions and the ensuing ease of conjugation of targeting molecules to the surface \n\nof the contrast agents for sensing and imaging. We have shown that in ? -Fe2O3@SiO2 \n\ncore-shell NPs, the coating thickness has a significant impact on their r2 and r2* \n\n\n\n \nCore-Shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n202 \n\nrelaxivities at medium and high fields and on r1 relaxivities at medium fields, as a result \n\nof decreased outer-sphere relaxation effects. Comparing the r2 and r2* values for the \n\ndifferent sizes of particles we were able to divide the silica coating in two regions, one \n\nimpermeable close to the ? -Fe2O3 core and one permeable to water and at the \n\ninterface with the bulk water. We have shown that by controlling this coating we are \n\nable to tune the size of these two regions. The impermeable one seems to increase up \n\nto a maximum value of 40 nm, while the permeable region goes on increasing with the \n\ncoating thickness. The diffusion of the water molecules in the permeable silica region is \n\nrelatively slow resulting in zero contribution to r2. The effect of silica coating of \n\nincreasing thickness on the r2/r1 ratio is different from that reported for nanocrystalline \n\nsuperparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (MIONs) coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-\n\nmodified, phospholipid micelle coating with increasing molecular weights which \n\nincrease the particle diameter, where this increase causes a r2 decrease and a r1 \n\nincrease\n.79 \n\nThe magnetometric curves ? -Fe2O3@SiO2 have been fitted with a Langevin \n\nfunction and the NMRD profiles with the model developed by Roch et al. The latter \n\nprovides a good fitting of the NMRD curves for the particles covered with the thinnest \n\nsilica layers. However, with increasing coating thickness, the silica diamagnetic \n\ncontribution cannot be neglected in the fitting of the NMRD profile and must be add ed \n\nto the contribution of the magnetic particles. A linear relationship between the NP sizes \n\nmeasured by TEM and by fitting the NMRD profiles is obtained, but the sizes obtained \n\nby NMRD are significantly lower than those measured by TEM. A correlation also \n\nexists between the values of Msat obtained by magnetometry and relaxometry, whereby \n\nthe Msat value of the superparamagnetic core strongly decreases with the increasing \n\nthickness of the diamagnetic silica shell. However such a Msat dilution as measured by \n\nNMRD is lower than expected for water-impermeable silica layers. Both results reflect \n\nthe fact that a significant part of the silica coating is permeable to water, in agreement \n\nwith what was proposed before for these systems.\n40\n\n The depth of this water-permeable \n\nlayer is uncertain, as the exchange of the more deeply penetrating water molecules \n\ncould become too slow to influence the measured relaxivity. This observation is of \n\nparamount importance in the context of the development of contrastophores for \n\nmolecular imaging. The adequate silica shell thickness may, thus, be tuned to allow for \n\nboth, a sufficiently high response as contrast agent, and an adequate grafting of \n\ntargeted biomolecules. \n\n\n\n \nCore-shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n \n\n 203 \n\nAdditionally, preliminary cytotoxicity studies confirmed that these contrast agents \n\ndo not appear detrimental to microglial cells. However, as the naked NPs have the \n\nhighest relaxivities, and the coating thickness does not play a role in their cytotoxicity, a \n\npreliminary conclusion is that overall optimal particles should have a minimal coating \n\nthickness to provide solution stability and a basis for surface conjugation without \n\ncompromising their relaxivities. \n\nTherefore, our results provide clues for the design of magnetic NP based contrast \n\nagents and their optimization for specific applications in medical diagnosis. This is up to \n\nnow the only technique to provide clear evidence that a silica layer used as a coating in \n\na core-shell system, exhibits regions that are porous to water and regions that are not. \n\nThe knowledge of theses systems may be extended to other systems and applications. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \nCore-Shell Nanoparticles for Bimodal-Imaging Contrast Agents \n\n \n \n\n204 \n\n \n\n5.5.

Two different types of \n\nnanoparticles performing as T1 and T2 MRI contrast agents were synthesised and their \n\nphysical and chemical properties characterised, namely texture, structure, \n1\nH dynamics \n\nand relaxometry and photoluminescence properties. The combination of the properties \n\nof trivalent lanthanide complexes and nanoparticles offered an excellent solution for \n\nbimodal imaging. The following relevant observations and conclusions may prompt \n\nfuture studies on related systems. \n\n \n\n? T1-type contrast agents \n\n \n\n? Bimodal MRI-photoluminescence probes for bio-imaging consisting on \n\nSiO2 nanoparticles derivatized with DTPA-Ln\n3+\n\n and PMN-Ln\n3+\n\n  complexes \n\n(SiO2@APS/DTPA:Gd:Ln; and SiO2@APS/PMN:Gd:Ln; Ln\n3+\n\n = Eu\n3+\n\n, Tb\n3+\n\n) \n\nwere developed. These systems bear an active magnetic centre (Gd\n3+\n\n) \n\nand photoluminescent ions (Eu\n3+\n\n or Tb\n3+\n\n) on the surface of silica \n\nnanoparticles. \n\n? The number of Ln\n3+\n\n (Eu\n3+\n\n, Tb\n3+\n\n and Gd\n3+\n\n) ions on the surface the \n\nSiO2@APS/DTPA nanoparticles (up to ca. 10\n4\n ions per nanoparticle) is \n\ndetermined by the amount of DTPA grafted. Because the \n\nSiO2@APS/PMN nanoparticles exhibit a second type of local coordination \n\nfor the Ln\n3+\n\n ion it is difficult to quantify the amount of PMN complex \n\ngrafted, although it is possible to estimate the amount of Ln\n3+ \n\nper \n\nnanoparticle (up to ca. 10\n5\n ions per nanoparticle).  \n\n? The tandem use of \n13\n\nC\n \nand\n\n 29\nSi solid-state NMR and DRIFT spectroscopy \n\nwas shown to be very powerful approach to study the modification of the \n\nsurface of the nanoparticles. Upon APS derivatization the number of \n\nsurface hydroxyl groups decreases and the \n29\n\nSi (Q\n2\n+Q\n\n3\n)/Q\n\n4\n population \n\nratio is reduced from 0.43 to 0.37. For the SiO2@APS/DTPA system, clear \n\nevidence of the covalent bonding between APS and DTPA is provided by \n\nthe secondary amide C=O stretch at 1685 cm\n-1\n. Since the number of \n\nsilanol groups increases (the ratio (Q\n2\n+Q\n\n3\n)/Q\n\n4\n increases from 0.37 to 0.62) \n\nreaction of SiO2@APS with DPTA has the side effect of modifying the \n\nsurface of the SiO2 nanoparticles. Although the APS to PMN covalent \n\n\n\n 213 \n\nbonding could not be ascertained by DRIFT or NMR evidence for it was \n\nforthcoming from photoluminescence spectroscopy. As observed in the \n\nDTPA system, the reaction between APS and PMN modified the \n\nnanoparticles surface, increasing the number of silanol groups, with \n\n(Q\n2\n+Q\n\n3\n)/Q\n\n4\n raising from 0.37 to 0.51. \n\n? Complexation of DTPA and PMN to Ln\n3+\n\n ions emitting in the visible region \n\nafforded long-life excited states, resistance to photo-bleaching, and sharp \n\nemission bands. The photoluminescence properties of the systems were \n\nnot changed by the incorporation of Gd\n3+\n\n ions. Evidence was obtained for \n\nthe energy transfer from the DTPA/PMN ligand to Ln\n3+\n\n. The grafting of \n\nPMN, a pyridine-based aromatic antenna ligand enhanced this energy \n\ntransfer. While in the SiO2@APS/DTPA:Eu system the Eu\n3+\n\n ions reside in \n\na single low-symmetry site, with a large local distribution, in the \n\nSiO2@APS/PMN:Eu system there are two local Eu\n3+\n\n environments. We \n\nconjectured that in one site the Eu\n3+\n\n coordinates to the PMN chelate, \n\nwhile in a second site it interacts strongly with the NPs surface via the \n\nsilanol groups, which are far more abundant than the amino groups on the \n\nsilica surface. \n\n? The incorporation of Gd\n3+\n\n ions, the MRI probe, in the nanosystems does \n\nnot change the emission properties of the Eu\n3+\n\n and Tb\n3+\n\n ions. The \n\nrelaxometric features of these nanoparticles are slightly better than the \n\nproperties of the commercially-available [Gd(DTPA)]\n2-\n\n complex. \n\n? The bimodal probes are rapidly and efficiently uptaken by RAW 264.7 \n\ncells (mouse macrophage cell line) exhibiting the\n1\n\nT -weighted MRI images \n\nof cellular pellets increased contrast and potential optical tracking by \n\nfluorescence. \n\n? In future studies an alternative and more efficient procedure should be \n\ndevised for grafting the PMN complex, ensuring that a single Eu\n3+\n\n local \n\nenvironment is present. \n\n \n\n \n\n? T2-type contrast agents \n\n \n\n? Iron oxide nanoparticles coated with silica layers of different thickness \n\nwere prepared. The stability of the resulting nanoparticles suspensions is \n\n\n\n \nCore-Shell Nanoparticles for Magnetic Resonance Imaging \n\n \n \n\n214 \n\nincreased by this silica shell, which also allows the straightforward grafting \n\nof targeting molecules. \n\n? The thickness of this silica shell changed considerably the r2 and r2* \n\nrelaxivities at medium and high B0 fields (0.47 T and 11.7 T), and the r1 \n\nrelaxivity at medium B0 fields (0.47 T) as a result of decreased outer-\n\nsphere relaxation effects. \n\n? A model was proposed to explain the impact of the silica shell on the r2 \n\nand r2* relaxivities. This model partitions the silica coating in two regions, \n\none impermeable to water and close to the ?-Fe2O3 core, the other porous \n\nto water and at the interface with the bulk water. \n\n? The magnetometry curves of the ?-Fe2O3@SiO2 nanoparticles were fitted \n\nwith a Langevin function and the NMRD profiles with the model of Roch et \n\nal. A good fit of the NMRD curves was obtained for particles covered with \n\nthe thinnest silica layers. For particles with relatively thick silica layers it \n\nwas necessary to introduce a contribution from the diamagnetic silica. \n\n? The cell viability and mitochondrial dehydrogenase expression given by \n\nthe microglial cells were evaluated and confirmed that these contrast \n\nagents are not detrimental to the microglial cells. \n\n? The knowledge obtained with these systems may now be extended to \n\nother systems and applications. The results provide clues for the design of \n\ncontrast agents based on superparamagnetic nanoparticles and their \n\noptimisation for specific medical diagnosis applications. \n\n? In future work this system should be extended to bimodal, by grafting a \n\nphotoluminescence probe. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\tsonia pinho_1\n\tsonia pinho_2\n\tsonia pinho_3\n\tsonia pinho_4\n\tsonia pinho_5\n\tsonia pinho_6\n\tsonia pinho_7\n\tsonia pinho_8"}]}}}
