In this context, scientific knowledge plays a major role in understanding \ncoastal processes at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, as well as in the \nintegration of different types of knowledge. However, scientific knowledge as not been \nused in full for the development of science-based coastal policies and management \nstrategies, and ineffective scientific knowledge transfer arises as a major obstacle in \nknowledge integration. Several reasons for ineffective knowledge transfer have been \nsuggested in the literature, most of which related with communication gaps.  \n\nThe main objective of the present work is to find means to improve the transfer of \ncoastal scientific knowledge fostering its incorporation into coastal management. This \nstudy was based upon a conceptual approach supported in a comprehensive literature \nreview and grounded in theoretical developments. Results benefits from the author\u2019s \nexperience gathered from different projects developed under the framework of the \npresent study. \n\nThe first step to achieve the main objective of this work was to identify who are the \nkey coastal actors and understanding the way they interact: this is of paramount \nimportance in a knowledge-transferring framework as they are the audience that \nscientists aim to reach. Beside scientists, two other key coastal actors are policy-makers \nand managers, and society. Policy-makers and managers are responsible for the regulation \nof the coastal zone uses by establishing and implementing the policy framework for the \ncoast. Society arises also as a key coastal actor as people benefit from the services \nprovided by the coastal environment. Although society is frequently regarded as a passive \nintervenient, the fact is that the role of society in the definition of coastal strategies is \nincreasing. Key coastal actors, their roles and links are schematized in The Coastal \nKnowledge Triangle.  \n\nThe second step was to identify the challenges faced by scientists in fostering \nscientific knowledge. Two major challenges were identified: the need to foster \nengagement among coastal actors, and the need to properly frame the message to be \ndelivered. Engagement is grounded on empathy and goes beyond simple awareness of \nthe problem. Four key enablers for successfully building engagement were identified: \nwillingness, trust, competence and commitment. Framing the message helps turning \nscientific data into meaningful information for the target audience, and implies choosing \nthe more adequate language (i.e., the manner in which scientific knowledge is traduced) \nand channels of communication (i.e., the manner in which the message is sent) according \nto the audience\u2019s specificities. Interpersonal communication, video and websites are \nexamples of widely used channels in science communication. The most adequate \nlanguages to traduce scientific knowledge are discourse (i.e., conceptual generalization of \nconversation), images (including photographs and graphical representations) and \nindicators.  \n\n\n\nAbstract \n\n - 14 -  \n\nThis study suggests that indicators the most efficient way to transmit inherently \ncomplex information in a simplified and applicable form, a conclusion in line with several \ninternational organizations. Considering their relevance, a common framework for the \nestablishment of coastal geoindicators for sandy coast environments was developed in \nthe scope of the present work.  \n\nThe third step was to identify mechanisms that scientists can adopt to connect with \ntheir audience. Each mechanism accounts for the audience specificities and conveys the \nmessage in a different way leading to different types and quantity of feedback. If \nadequately used, mechanisms improve the transfer of scientific knowledge by fostering \nengagement, minimizing framing effort and optimizing audiences\u2019 feedback. The most \nwidely known (and adopted) mechanism to transfer scientific knowledge is outreach (as \nformal education is not encompassed in the scope of this work). However, scientists\u2019 \nmust be aware that other mechanisms are available: crowdsourcing, managers-oriented \ntools and co-production. These mechanisms although in earlier stages of development \nare promising alternatives and should be considered as major opportunities to foster \nknowledge transfer. In the scope of the present work, a conceptual model was developed \nto help scientists in selecting the most adequate mechanism to convey the coastal \nmessage. In this selection, scientists must weigh the level of engagement of the audience \nand account for the feedback raised by each mechanism: outreach leads to coastal \nawareness; crowdsourcing to data generation; management-oriented tools generate \ninformation, and co-production boosts knowledge. The application of each mechanism \nand related feedback is thoroughly discussed in this work grounded in real-world \napplications. The adequate use of these mechanisms will lead to a knowledge-based \nsociety and will increase the participation of key coastal actors in decision-making. \nTherefore, scientists should actively pursue the goal of transferring their knowledge \noutside of the scientific community, by adopting the proper mechanisms to connect with \ntheir audience, developing their framing skills and acknowledging the benefits of \nengaging with others. Not only this is a social responsibility of scientists but, ultimately, it \nwill also benefit the value of research endeavors towards [coastal] sustainability.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: knowledge transfer; coastal actors; engagement; outreach; crowdsourcing; \nmanagement-oriented tools; co-production; coastal sustainability. \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n - 15 -  \n\nResumo \nA sustentabilidade da zona costeira s\u00f3 \u00e9 poss\u00edvel atrav\u00e9s da integra\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nconhecimento (lato sensu) na defini\u00e7\u00e3o de estrat\u00e9gias de planeamento e gest\u00e3o. Neste \ncontexto, o conhecimento cient\u00edfico apresenta uma import\u00e2ncia fundamental na \ncompreens\u00e3o dos processos que condicionam a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o costeira, mas tamb\u00e9m na \nintegra\u00e7\u00e3o de outras fontes de conhecimento (n\u00e3o cient\u00edfico) associados \u00e0 zona costeira. \nNo entanto, presentemente, a integra\u00e7\u00e3o do conhecimento cient\u00edfico na gest\u00e3o da zona \ncosteira \u00e9 geralmente efetuada de forma n\u00e3o-sistem\u00e1tica e, na maioria dos casos, em \ncontextos reativos. Esta situa\u00e7\u00e3o deve-se essencialmente a constrangimentos associados \u00e0 \ntransfer\u00eancia do conhecimento cient\u00edfico entre as comunidades cient\u00edficas e n\u00e3o \ncient\u00edficas, relacionados com limita\u00e7\u00f5es na comunica\u00e7\u00e3o entre as partes.      \n\nO principal objectivo deste trabalho \u00e9 definir estrat\u00e9gias que potenciem a transfer\u00eancia \ndo conhecimento cient\u00edfico, entre as comunidades cient\u00edfica e n\u00e3o cient\u00edfica, \npromovendo a sua integra\u00e7\u00e3o no planeamento e gest\u00e3o da zona costeira. Este trabalho \u00e9 \nbaseado numa abordagem conceptual suportada em vasta pesquisa bibliogr\u00e1fica e no \ndesenvolvimento de um conjunto de projetos que foram desenvolvidos e implementados \nno \u00e2mbito deste estudo. \n\nA primeira fase deste trabalho consistiu na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos principais atores da zona \ncosteira. Para al\u00e9m dos cientistas, respons\u00e1veis pela gera\u00e7\u00e3o do conhecimento cient\u00edfico, \nforam identificados os decisores pol\u00edticos e gestores, e a sociedade em geral: os decisores \npol\u00edticos e gestores enquanto respons\u00e1veis pela regula\u00e7\u00e3o da zona costeira atrav\u00e9s do \nestabelecimento e implementa\u00e7\u00e3o dos instrumentos legais de ordenamento da orla \ncosteira; a sociedade uma vez que beneficia, direta e indiretamente, dos servi\u00e7os \nfornecidos pela zona costeira e pelo ao seu papel cada vez mais interventivo e de maior \nrelev\u00e2ncia na tomada de decis\u00e3o. De forma a conceptualizar as rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre os \nprincipais atores da zona costeira foi desenvolvido o \u201cTri\u00e2ngulo do Conhecimento \nCosteiro\u201d (The Coastal Knowledge Triangle). \n\nA segunda fase constituiu na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos desafios que os cientistas encontram na \ntransfer\u00eancia do conhecimento cient\u00edfico. Neste contexto foram identificadas duas a\u00e7\u00f5es \nque podem atuar como catalisadores da transfer\u00eancia do conhecimento: promover o \nengajamento (engagement) entre os principais atores e enquadrar (framing) a \u201cmensagem\u201d \nnum formato que considere as especificidades da audi\u00eancia. O engajamento implica o \nenvolvimento dos cientistas n\u00e3o s\u00f3 na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o do problema mas tamb\u00e9m na sua \nresolu\u00e7\u00e3o e beneficia da exist\u00eancia de (maior) empatia entre as diferentes partes \nenvolvidas. O enquadramento da mensagem implica a tradu\u00e7\u00e3o e disponibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do \nconhecimento cient\u00edfico em dados e informa\u00e7\u00e3o relevante para os outros atores \n(receptores da mensagem) atrav\u00e9s da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de uma linguagem (forma como a \ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 traduzida) e de canais de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o adequados. No \u00e2mbito do presente \ntrabalho, foram identificadas com linguagens mais adequadas para a transfer\u00eancia do \nconhecimento cient\u00edfico, o discurso, as imagens (incluindo fotografias e gr\u00e1ficos) e os \nindicadores.  \n\n\n\nResumo \n\n - 16 -  \n\nOs indicadores foram considerados como a linguagem mais adequada para transmitir \ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o inerentemente complexa de uma forma simples e aplic\u00e1vel. Esta constata\u00e7\u00e3o \nest\u00e1 de acordo com as orienta\u00e7\u00f5es de  v\u00e1rias organiza\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais de reconhecido \nm\u00e9rito. Neste sentido, no \u00e2mbito do presente trabalho foi desenvolvido um quadro de \nrefer\u00eancia para o estabelecimento e reporte de geoindicadores orientados para a descri\u00e7\u00e3o \ndo estado e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o de litorais arenosos. \n\n Por \u00faltimo foram identificados diferentes mecanismos para os cientistas se \nrelacionarem com a audi\u00eancia e que t\u00eam como objetivo potenciar a transfer\u00eancia do \nconhecimento. Cada um dos mecanismos pressup\u00f5e o estabelecimento de diferentes \ntipos de liga\u00e7\u00e3o com a audi\u00eancia gerando, por sua vez, diferentes tipos de resposta. \nAdicionalmente, se devidamente utilizados, estes mecanismos n\u00e3o s\u00f3 promovem a \ntransfer\u00eancia do conhecimento mas tamb\u00e9m promovem o engajamento, minimizam os \nesfor\u00e7os no enquadramento da mensagem e otimizam a resposta da audi\u00eancia. O mais \nconhecido, e utilizado, mecanismo de transfer\u00eancia do conhecimento cient\u00edfico \u00e9 a \ndivulga\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica (outreach). No entanto, existem outras formas para transferir \nconhecimento cient\u00edfico: a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva de dados (crowdsourcing), ferramentas de \napoio \u00e0 gest\u00e3o e co-produ\u00e7\u00e3o. Estes mecanismos, apesar de se encontrarem numa fase \nmais inicial de desenvolvimento e aplica\u00e7\u00e3o, constituem alternativas de elevado potencial \nna transfer\u00eancia do conhecimento. Neste estudo, todos estes mecanismos s\u00e3o \napresentados e discutidos com base em projetos concretos desenvolvidos no \u00e2mbito \ndeste trabalho. \n\nPara orientar os cientistas na sele\u00e7\u00e3o do mecanismo mais adequado para transferirem \na sua mensagem foi desenvolvido um modelo conceptual. Nesta sele\u00e7\u00e3o, os cientistas \ndevem considerar o n\u00edvel de engajamento entre os atores e o tipo de resposta que os \ncientistas desejam gerar na audi\u00eancia: enquanto a divulga\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica promove a literacia \ne a sensibiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva de dados promove a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de dados, as \nferramentas orientadas para o apoio \u00e0 gest\u00e3o promovem a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de informa\u00e7\u00e3o e a co-\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o a gera\u00e7\u00e3o de (novo) conhecimento. Verificou-se que a ado\u00e7\u00e3o dos diferentes os \nmecanismos tem um vasto potencial na promo\u00e7\u00e3o uma sociedade baseada no \nconhecimento e potencia a participa\u00e7\u00e3o dos diferentes atores costeiros no processo de \ndecis\u00e3o. Neste sentido, os cientistas devem promover ativamente a transfer\u00eancia do \nconhecimento cient\u00edfico para al\u00e9m das fronteiras da comunidade cient\u00edfica. \u00c9 ainda \nfundamental que os cientistas desenvolvam as suas compet\u00eancias no enquadramento da \nmensagem e reconhe\u00e7am os benef\u00edcios de interagir com os outros atores. Esta atitude \u00e9 \numa responsabilidade social dos cientistas que, em \u00faltima inst\u00e2ncia, ir\u00e1 valorizar os seus \nesfor\u00e7os na gera\u00e7\u00e3o do conhecimento cient\u00edfico e contribuir para a sustentabilidade da \nzona costeira.  \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: transfer\u00eancia do conhecimento; atores da zona costeira; engajamento; \ndivulga\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica; aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o coletiva de dados; ferramentas de apoio \u00e0 gest\u00e3o; co-\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o; sustentabilidade costeira. \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \nIMPROVING THE TRANSFER OF COASTAL \n\nSCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE: FROM CONCEPT TO \nIMPLEMENTATION \n\n \n \n\nChapter 1 \n\nIntroduction \n \n\n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n - 18 -  \n\nChapter 1 \n\n1. Introduction \n\n1.1 Motivation \n\nMoving towards sustainable development implies the incorporation of scientific \nknowledge in the management framework. The importance of scientific knowledge is \nacknowledged by major international organizations and highlighted in strategic \ndocuments such as the Agenda 21 (UN, 1992), and the Declaration on Science and the \nUse of Scientific Knowledge (UNESCO, 2000). Here, scientific knowledge integration is \nconsidered as being indispensable aiming at sustainability and, beyond desirable, it is \nstated as a social responsibility of scientists.  \n\nThe integration of scientific knowledge has been growing in importance in coastal \nmanagement as the coast is one of the most dynamic and vulnerable Earth\u2019s \nenvironments highly susceptible to human demands and to global climate change (e.g., \nHinkel et al., 2015; IPCC, 2014; UNESCO, 2007; Agardy et al., 2005).  However, only a \nsmall part of scientific endeavor has been effectively used in the development of coastal \nmanagement strategies (e.g., Nursey-Bray et al., 2014; van Koningsveld et al., 2005). In the \npast, the inability to recognize coastal change has led to serious errors in terms of \nmanagement practice (e.g., Douglass, 2002). These errors are particularly obvious in \nhighly populated coasts, were unwisely occupation collides with the inherent dynamics of \nthe coast (e.g., MacFadden, 2007; Hsu et al., 1999). Nowadays, the rate of population \ngrowth and urbanization in coastal areas is still increasing and this trend is expected to \ncontinue into the near future (e.g., UNESCO, 2007; Brown et al., 2008). Neumann et al. \n(2015) estimate that the number of people living in low-lying coastal areas will grow \nbetween 2000 and 2060 from 625 million in 2000 up to 1.4 billion people in 2060. This \nincrease will most likely put additional pressure on the coast and might thus endanger \nsustainability (Sekovski et al., 2012). Adding to this scenario, the expected climate change-\nrelated effects may increase the intensity and frequency of risk-prone events throughout \nthe 21st century and beyond (Hinkel et al., 2015; IPCC, 2014). Attaining coastal \nsustainability has been a difficult goal in the past and, given that, at present, this goal \nshould consider cumulative impacts of climate change an even bigger challenge lays \nahead. Nevertheless, while the importance of scientific knowledge integration is widely \nrecognized, significant gaps still remain in the effective incorporation of science outputs \nin the management agenda.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n - 19 -  \n\n1.2 Gaps in scientific knowledge transfer  \n[This subchapter is based on: Carapu\u00e7o, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal \nchange: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] \n\nSeveral reasons for ineffective scientific knowledge transfer have been suggested in \nthe literature. According to Anderson (1992) the problem mainly depends on scientists \noften allowing for much more interest, time, and effort to the production of new \nknowledge than to the dissemination of their research results. For van Koningsveld et al. \n(2005), scientific knowledge transfer has been hindered due to the complexity of the data \navailable. This translates in the inherent difficulty in applying straightforwardly the \nresearch findings into the coastal management process. According to de Jonge (2007) \nmany scientists fail to translate their data-rich research output into information that is \nunderstandable, useful and appealing to managers. Stone (2002) pointed out the lack of \ndialogue as the cause for the inadequate or insufficient use made of research findings. \nCarapu\u00e7o et al. (2014a) identified as the major gap the inefficiency of the channels used \nfor scientific data dissemination, which are not adequate to reach coastal managers. Jones \net al. (2008) and Diedrich et al. (2010) noted that research is often conducted disregarding \nthe needs of decision-makers, and this limits the responsiveness of research to current \npolicy concerns. However, these authors also pointed lack of political will, limited \nresearcher credibility in the eyes of policy-makers, and decisions being taken based on \npolitical premises rather than science, as reasons hindering the effectiveness of scientific \nknowledge transfer. In fact, several authors claim that the reasons for gaps in scientific \nknowledge transfer exclusively fall under the responsibility of policy-makers and \nmanagers. The resistance to adopt new knowledge, the motivation to seek and use \ninformation, and their often-limited competencies and skills in \u201ctranslating\u201d scientific \nknowledge are some of the main handicaps reported in the literature (Becheikh et al., \n2010; Kirst, 2010; de Jonge, 2007; Hemsley-Brown and Oplatka, 2005). For Nielson \n(2001) the problem lies \u201csomewhere in the middle\u201d and the non-use of research has been \nlargely explained as an outcome of the cultural gap between scientists and non- scientists \nin relation to their values, jargon, time-frames, reward systems and professional \naffiliations to such an extent that they live in separate worlds.  \n\nThe central issue is that, regardless on which side relies the responsibility of barriers in \nscientific knowledge transfer, communication gaps arise as the major obstacle to \nscientific knowledge transfer. Furthermore, it should be noted that scientific literature \ndevaluates the role of society in scientific knowledge transfer (Bonne et al., 2014). Thus, \nthe amplitude of communication gaps in knowledge transfer is probably wider than \nexpectable. The consequence is that this communication gap must be approached from \nboth the scientists\u2019 and non-scientists\u2019 \u201csides\u201d. Scientists should acknowledge that their \nrole does not end when scientific knowledge is developed and that they also have a role \nin its successful delivery to non-scientists. In this sense, scientists should take the first \nstep in the direction towards knowledge transfer and should actively pursue this \nobjective.  \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n - 20 -  \n\n1.3 Objective of the work \n\nThe objective of the present work is to find means to improve the transfer of coastal \nscientific knowledge. This work aims to be a contribution in strengthening the links \namong scientists and other key coastal actors, a vital step towards sustainability.  \n\nThis objective lead to the following research questions: \n\n\u2022 Who are the key coastal actors and what are their roles? \n\u2022 What are the challenges faced by scientists in knowledge transfer?  \n\u2022 What strategies can help scientists to connect with their audience and improve \n\nknowledge transfer? \n\nThis study was based upon a conceptual approach supported by a comprehensive \nliterature review and critical thinking. Notwithstanding its theoretical approach this work \nwas developed under the premise that to be useful to scientists a tangible result should be \nput forward. To achieve this objective, a conceptual model presenting guidelines for \nscientists to improve the transfer of scientific knowledge was developed. This model \nbenefited from the author\u2019s experience gathered from different projects developed under \nthe scope of the present study supported by real-world case studies undertaken and \ntested in the scope of this thesis. \n\n1.4 Outline of the thesis \n\nThe thesis is divided into seven chapters, with a structure consistent with the research \nquestions formulated above. \n\nChapter 1 presents the motivation and defines the objective of the work.  \n\nChapter 2 focuses on key coastal actors, their roles and links.  \n\nChapter 3 addresses the challenges that arise in scientific knowledge transfer. In this \nchapter, the identification of the existing gaps in coastal knowledge transfer is supported \nby results from a worldwide survey targeting coastal scientists, policy-makers and \nmanagers. Based upon these results, conditions for fostering scientific knowledge \ntransfer are put forward. \n\nChapter 4 focuses on coastal indicators as one of the most adequate languages to \nimprove the transfer of coastal scientific knowledge. A common framework for the \nestablishment of coastal geoindicators for sandy coast environments developed in the \nscope of this work is presented. \n\nChapter 5 presents mechanisms that can be adopted to help scientists to connect with \ntheir audience. Each mechanism conveys the coastal message in a different way and \naccounts for the audience specificities. Real-world applications of the different \nmechanisms are presented and thoroughly discussed. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n - 21 -  \n\nChapter 6 presents a conceptual model to guide scientists in the selection of the most \neffective mechanism to convey their science-based message. This selection will depend \nboth on audience\u2019s engagement and aspired feedback. \n\nChapter 7 presents the conclusions of the work and provides an outlook for moving \nforward in scientific knowledge transfer.  \n\nThis thesis includes approaches and results that have been published in encyclopedias, \nbooks and peer-reviewed scientific journals. In order to assure fluency to the thesis small \nchanges were introduced, when appropriate, to the original contents of those \ncontributions. Specific reference to those publications is made in each chapter or \nsubchapter.    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nIMPROVING THE TRANSFER OF COASTAL \nSCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE: FROM CONCEPT TO \n\nIMPLEMENTATION \n \n\n \n\nChapter 2 \n\nCoastal actors, their roles and links \n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n - 24 -  \n\nChapter 2 \n\n2. Coastal actors, their roles and links \n[This subchapter is based on: Carapu\u00e7o, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal \nchange: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] \n\nThe identification of the coastal actors, taken as those who have a role in the coastal \nagenda, and understanding the way they interact is of paramount importance in the \ndevelopment of a scientific knowledge-transfer framework and a critical factor in the \nsuccessful coastal management (Brown et al., 2002). Moreover, coastal actors (other than \nthose directly involved in coastal research) make the audiences that scientists aim to \nreach and knowing the audience is vital to ensure that communication is successful. In \naddition, and as put forward by Stocker and Wood (2014), \u201c\u2026coastal actors do not \nfunction alone but in existing networks and in legal, policy, political, social, technological, \neconomic and cultural contexts. Coastal actors share links and can collaborate with each \nother to share power and available resources, such as knowledge\u201d. Therefore, \nunderstanding the links between scientists and the other coastal actors is also \nfundamental in moving forward knowledge transfer and implementation.   \n\n2.1 Coastal actors and their roles \n\nScientists are those who pursuit knowledge and the understanding of the natural and \nsocial world entailing unbiased observations and systematic experimentation, following a \nsystematic methodology based on evidence (EEB, 2016; TSC, 2016).  \n\nScientists generate knowledge based on the scientific method and aim to transfer it to \nother coastal actors. As scientific knowledge allows for the understanding of the natural \nworld, it gives scientists a unique perspective on the coastal system. The ability to \nconsider the processes driving coastal dynamics at different spatial and time scales makes \nscientists capable of supporting the functioning of that system under different forcing \nscenarios and evaluate different short- to long-term coastal management strategies. \nMoreover, scientific knowledge is not only relevant per se but also necessary in the \nintegration of \u201call types of knowledge\u201d (Nursey-Bray et al., 2014), which also includes \nbureaucratic and local knowledge (e.g., Edelenbos and van Buuren, 2011; Rinaudo and \nGarin, 2005; Hunt and Shackley, 1999). Benefits in the mobilization of bureaucratic and \nlocal knowledge are highlighted by Rinaudo and Garin (2005), and include \u201cimproving \nthe quality of the identification of the issues at stake, the formulation of a generally \ncomplex and unstructured problem, and the identification of a large panel of alternative \nsolutions\u201d.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCoastal actors, their roles and links \n\n - 25 -  \n\nPolicy-makers and managers are responsible for the regulation of the coastal zone \nuses by establishing and implementing the policy framework for the coast. These actors \ndetain bureaucratic knowledge, which is heavily intertwined with administrative and \ngovernmental practices (Edelenbos and van Buuren, 2011). When scientists aim to \nimplement their findings policy-makers and managers are usually their primary audience.  \n\nSociety arises also as a key coastal actor as they benefit from the services provided by \nthe coastal environment. Society is a very heterogeneous actor encompassing several \nclusters of people sharing similar goals and activities (e.g., surfers, fishermen, tourists). \nWhile a common understanding within these [sub]groups can ease knowledge transfer, \nscientists need to be aware that different clusters may have different coastal interests or \nexpectations for the coast. This can favor the emergence of conflicts and constitute a \nbarrier to science communication.  \n\nSociety is linked with the generation of local knowledge grounded in the experience \ngathered from physical proximity. Local knowledge is strongly associated with the day-to-\nday activities of coastal users and derives from the practices in which people (inhabitants, \nentrepreneurs, etc.) are involved (Eshuis and Stuiver, 2005). Although society has been \nand still is frequently regarded as a passive intervenient, the fact is that the role of society \nin the definition of coastal strategies is increasing. In fact, to ensure broad support for \nthe implementation of management strategies, society must adhere to the proposed ideas \nand solutions.  \n\nIn summary three major groups - scientists (coastal researchers), policy-makers and \nmanagers (coastal regulators), and society (coastal users) - arise as key players in the \ncoastal agenda and each group has a specific role to play in that agenda. \n\nTable 1 presents the profile typology of the key actors. The information presented is \nbased upon the results of the Socientize project (Socientize Team, 2013). \n\n \n\nTable 1.

This model is based upon the works of R\u00f6ckmann et \nal. (2015) and Hunt and Shackley (1999). R\u00f6ckmann et al. (2015) present The Interaction \nTriangle as a tool for understanding stakeholder interactions in marine ecosystem-based \nmanagement. Hunt and Shackley (1999) present The Climate Knowledge Triangle with \npossible forms of associating different types of knowledge in the scope of climate \nchange.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. The Coastal Knowledge Triangle: coastal actors, their roles and links. Scientists use \nresearch methods to develop scientific knowledge and aim to transfer it. Policy-makers and \nmanagers, who detain bureaucratic knowledge, regulate the use of the coastal zone and convey \ntheir needs of information to scientists. Society benefits from the services provided by the coastal \nenvironment (e.g. fisheries, surfing, beach activities) and acquire local knowledge in relation to \nday-to-day activities; it influences policy-makers and managers by lobbying, and convey their \nneeds of information to both policy-makers and managers, and scientists. \n\nThe Coastal Knowledge Triangle (Figure 1) shows that the understanding of links among \nthe different key coastal actors is a fundamental step in fostering knowledge transfer. The \nexistence of weak bounds, or even disconnection, among coastal actors can seriously \nprejudice knowledge transfer. It must be stressed, however, that the links among them \ndepend not only on their willingness but also on societal organization. This can be put in \nevidence through the consideration of some basic forms of governance and their \nimplications in knowledge integration, where politicians, a subset of policy-makers group, \ndetain a critical role in implementation. \n\nIn participatory governance schemes where decision-making disregards scientific \nknowledge, management strategies emerge from the interaction between regulators and \nsociety (users). This scheme ensures that immediate societal expectations are integrated \n\n\n\nCoastal actors, their roles and links \n\n - 27 -  \n\nwithin the spirit of regulations and management decisions. However, disregarding \nscientific knowledge, results in a disproportionally large influence of lobbying in the \ndecision-making process that can threaten sustainability. In fact, the demands of society \nfrequently do not encompass an adequate perception of coastal risk, especially at \nmedium- to long-term time scales. For example, the uninformed occupation of a \nseafront, which may not be perceived as problematic in the short-term, may disregard or \neven lead to severe coastal erosion and flooding on a longer time scale, and compromise \nfuture management options. However, a governance system exclusively driven by \nscientific and bureaucratic knowledge, generally fails to consider the different points of \nview and needs of society. Such a technocratic system has well-known limitations in the \nability to manage conflicts inherent to the different interests of coastal users (for \nexample, as in the case of nuclear power plants located on the coast). Finally, under \ncentralized governance schemes, policy-makers and managers (regulators) are decoupled \nfrom every other actor. In the case of centralized schemes, not only there is no \nindependent control of management decisions, but there are also no countervailing \nmechanisms to assure coastal sustainability and the incorporation of society\u2019s \nexpectations. These considerations highlight the importance of the political environment, \nin its broadest sense, in providing the adequate settings to foster scientific knowledge \ntransfer. In this context, the influence of politicians goes beyond policy-making and \nknowledge implementation, as they can also have a fundamental role in strengthening the \nlinks among key coastal actors.  \n\nChapter 2 |Key messages: \n\nv? The identification of the coastal actors and understanding the way they interact is of \nparamount importance in the development of a scientific knowledge-transferring \nframework: they are the audience that scientists aim to reach and knowing the audience is \nvital to make communication successful. \n\nv? Three key actors arise in the coastal agenda: scientists, policy-makers and managers, and \nsociety. Each actor has a specific role in the framework for the coast namely in \ncontributing with specific types of knowledge to the overall objective of sustainability.  \n\nv? Key coastal actors, their roles and links are summarized and illustrated by the Coastal \nKnowledge Triangle.  \n\nv? The Coastal Knowledge Triangle stresses that the understanding of links among the different \nkey coastal actors is a fundamental step in fostering knowledge transfer and that the \nexistence of weak bounds, or even disconnection, among coastal actors can seriously \nprejudice knowledge transfer. \n\nv? The political environment influences the establishment and the strength of the links \namong key coastal actors. Nevertheless, scientists should always seek an active role in \nfostering knowledge transfer, even in an adequate political environment favoring the \nincorporation of scientific knowledge in decision-making. \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIMPROVING THE TRANSFER OF COASTAL \nSCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE: FROM CONCEPT TO \n\nIMPLEMENTATION \n \n\n \n\nChapter 3 \n\nFostering scientific knowledge transfer \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n - 30 -  \n\nChapter 3 \n\n3. Fostering scientific knowledge transfer  \nImproving the integration of scientific knowledge in the development of coastal \n\nstrategies implies that scientists must have an active role in fostering knowledge transfer. \nHowever, in doing this, scientists face several barriers hindering knowledge transfer, as \ndescribed in sub-chapter 1.2 Gaps in scientific knowledge transfer. To overcome these barriers \nit is first necessary to acknowledge that the process of [science] communication involves \na sender [scientist] delivering a message to a receiver (or receivers) [the other coastal \nactors] (Figure 2). Scientists must translate their message using a language that other \ncoastal actors can understand and select the most adequate communication channel (or \nchannels). This process is called framing (Figure 2). If scientists successfully frame their \nmessage, they will get feedback from their audience. Feedback indicates if and to what \nextent the message has been successfully transferred and is considered the essence of \ntwo-way communication (Hattie and Timperley, 2007). Engagement can be perceived as \na \u201cdistance\u201d between the sender and the receiver. If the sender and receiver are closer, \nthe effort needed to convey the message (framing) is lower. For example, if the receiver \nunderstands scientific language, the framing effort in is smaller. \n\nv\u00ea se \n\nFigure 2. The science communication process: scientists aim to deliver the coastal message to the \nother actors and to be successful they need to frame their message. If scientists are able to \nconnect with their audience and convey their message, receivers will give feedback. Engagement \nconceptualizes the distance that scientists need to overcome in delivering the message: shorter \ndistances imply smaller framing efforts.   \n\n \n\n\n\nFostering scientific knowledge transfer \n\n - 31 -  \n\n \n\nFostering engagement and framing the coastal message arise as two conditions that \nscientists can act upon to overcame barriers in knowledge transfer. Scientists also have to \nfind means to connect with the receivers choosing which of the following four \nmechanisms would provide the most effective linkage: outreach, crowdsourcing, \nmanagers-oriented tools and co-production (these mechanisms are further discussed later \nin Chapter 5. Mechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation).  \n\nIn any case, and despite the level of scientists\u2019 motivation to communicate science, \nthey should initiate the communication process by knowing their audiences and, ideally, \nby listen to them. Scientists have been responsible for almost all of the investigation \naddressing gaps in scientific knowledge transfer. Thus, most of the gaps identify in the \nliterature have been inferred from their own experience (see sub-chapter 1.2). Actually, \nthe literature lacks contribution on this subject accounting for the view of other coastal \nactors. Devaluating the opinion of the other coastal actors narrows the chance of \nidentifying barriers to the communication process and this may reduce the effectiveness \nof strategies to narrow these barriers resting solely with scientists. To overcome this \nissue, and transform the \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d one-way communication scheme into a \nbroader two-way avenue, a worldwide web survey targeting coastal experts, including \nboth scientists and policy-makers and managers, has been designed and conducted under \nthe scope of this thesis. Results are presented and discussed below and were used to put \nforward conditions to improve knowledge transfer complementing previous studies.   \n\n3.1 The need to listen \n[This subchapter is based on: Carapu\u00e7o, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., Freitas, M.C. 2014a.

However, scientists and \npolicy-makers and managers frequently have different, and occasionally divergent, \nunderstandings of the meaning of \u201crelevant information\u201d: scientists every so often focus \non the state of the art, and policy-makers and managers usually expect translated data and \ninformation able to directly support management decisions.  \n\nA worldwide survey was conducted between September and November 2013 using \nthe SurveyMonkey\u00ae platform in order to assess the opinions of coastal scientists and \npolicy-makers and managers about gaps in the transfer of coastal scientific knowledge. A \ntotal of 174 enquiries were gathered. Coastal scientists provided 107 answers (n=107) and \ncoastal policy-makers and managers (involving in local to national authorities, non- and \ngovernmental organizations, tourism, fisheries and port authorities, provided 67 answers \n(n=67).  \n\n\n\nFostering scientific knowledge transfer \n\n - 32 -  \n\nResults are available at a University of Lisbon website \n(http://disepla.fc.ul.pt/ktransfer/index.htm) excluding personal data to ensure \nparticipants\u2019 anonymity. Data management and processing was done using IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae \nStatistics and ESRI\u00ae ArcGIS applications. Figure 3 shows the geographical distribution of \nthe population targeted.  \n\nBoth the majority of scientists, and policy-makers and managers have been \nconducting their work in Portugal (57 and 82% respectively) followed by United States of \nAmerica (12 and 16% respectively).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Geographic distribution of the scientists (n=107), and policy-makers and managers \nsample (n=67). \n\n \n\nResults of the survey indicate that the majority of scientists (more than 80%) aim at \nincorporating their scientific findings in coastal zone management.  It was also possible \nto conclude that the incorporation of scientific knowledge in coastal management is \nbecoming \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, as almost 40% of the policy-makers and managers stated \nthat they always use scientific knowledge in their work (Carapu\u00e7o et al., 2014a). These \nresults are a positive sign in the scope of scientific knowledge transfer, allowing deducing \na favorable environment to foster knowledge transfer and showing willingness of \nscientists and policy-makers and mangers to move forward knowledge transfer and \nintegration. \n\nDifferent means of science dissemination are depicted in Figure 4 and Figure 5. Figure 4 \nshows the effort/time spent by scientists in each science dissemination instrument \nrevealing that research papers and technical reports are the means preferred by scientists, \nwhile non-technical outputs received less attention and merited less effort. Figure 5 shows \nthat technical reports and papers are the means more often used by policy-makers and \nmanagers to access to scientific and technical contents.  \n\n \n\nResponses\n0\n\n1 - 2\n\n3 - 5\n\n6 - 10\n\n>10\n\n\n\nFostering scientific knowledge transfer \n\n - 33 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Research papers are the \npreferred means of dissemination by scientists and this inherently implies using technical \nvocabulary (and frequently specific jargon), which may not be adequate to reach policy-\nmakers and managers. Moreover, research papers follow a reasoning outline that may \ntransform a fine scientific paper into a tedious document from the point of view of the \n\u201cnon-initiated\u201d reader.   \n\nThis suggests that policy-makers and managers are indeed constrained in their ability \nto use the information made available in scientific papers and technical reports. This \nempathizes the need of scientists to find the time and resources to disseminate their \nknowledge in non-scientists terms or, in alternative, the incorporation of knowledge \nbrokers or resorting to boundary organizations as facilitators (as discussed further in sub-\nchapter 3.3 Framing the message). This is depicted by the two bars on the right side of \nfigures Figure 4 and Figure 5. \n\nResults also reveal that both scientists and policy-makers and managers identified a \nwide range of causes for gaps in scientific knowledge transfer besides the adequacy of \nchannels used in data dissemination (Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively). This may be due \nto differences in the respondents\u2019 profile (e.g., different skills, responsibilities, \nexperiences, competencies). However, the overall perception of scientists and non-\nscientists concerning this matter reflects an unexpected general agreement, expressed by \nthe similarity between the bars diagram depicted in Figure 6 and Figure 7.  \n\nAs a side thought this result raises relevant issues concerning the policies of scientific \ndata dissemination and evaluation systems of scientists and scientific institutions that may \nbe contributing to \u201cgetting apart\u201d scientists and science from policy-makers and \nmanagers and society. In too many cases, rakings and measure of performance of \nscientists and institutions are to a large extent based upon indexes and activities of \noutreach have been somewhat underestimated.  \n\nIn conclusion, results from this survey corroborate the major outcome of the \nliterature review presented in sub-chapter 1.2 Gaps in scientific knowledge transfer: \ncommunication gaps are the major obstacle in scientific knowledge transfer (regardless \nthe scope being restricted to coastal issues or other aspects of scientific knowledge). The \ncritical issue contributing to communication gaps is the channel of communication. Both \nscientists and non-scientists converge in identifying a large suite of reasons justifying the \nexistence of communication gaps, besides the channels of communication, and both \ncommunities rank them in a similar way. This similarity constitutes a major opportunity \nin bridging together both key coastal actors. \n\n\n\nFostering scientific knowledge transfer \n\n - 36 -  \n\n3.2 Fostering engagement  \n\n[This subchapter is based on: Carapu\u00e7o, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal \nchange: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] \n\nThe science communication process conceptualized in Figure 2 evidences that \n\novercoming communication gaps is more likely to happen with effective engagement of \n\ncoastal actors. Engagement is grounded on empathy and goes beyond simple awareness of \n\nthe problem: it includes caring, motivation, willingness to act, and action itself (Lorenzoni et \n\nal., 2007).  \n\nEngagement is not a simple task: it is an ongoing process, not confined within the \n\ntimeframe of a particular project and there is no simple best way to engage with an audience \n\n(or audiences) (Cormick, 2012). \u201cGet-together\u201d opportunities, ranging from small informal \n\nmeetings and workshops to conferences and seminars, are one way to foster engagement and \n\nmaintain the linkages among the actors beyond project timeframes, enabling conditions to \n\nreach compromise and clearing ways for future co-operation. Willingness, trust, competence \n\nand commitment can be regarded as key enablers for successfully building engagement (e.g., \n\nR\u00f6ckmann et al., 2015; Schmidt et al., 2014) (Figure 8). Achieving these conditions implies \n\nthat scientists should be prepared to promote open and honest dialogues about their \n\nfindings, including the benefits but also the limits, perils, and pitfalls (Lsehner, 2003). This \n\npractice is grounded in the principles of the precautionary principle (Carapu\u00e7o, 2015a) and of \n\nthe \u201cbest available knowledge\u201d, meaning the latest state of knowledge or \u201cstate of the art\u201d. \n\nAccording to the latter scientists acknowledge the existence of changes and limitations in \n\nscientific knowledge and understanding. Moreover, scientists should also be prepared to \n\nmove forward and be expose to the public opinion something much more familiar to \n\nmanagers.  \n\n \n\nFigure 8. Key enablers of engagement: willingness, trust, competence and commitment. \n\n \n\n\n\nFostering scientific knowledge transfer \n\n - 37 -  \n\nEngagement is a major and serious challenge but it will enhance understanding of the \n\nscientific approach to coastal issues, raising awareness of the value of scientific output and \n\nhelp in decision-making. Engagement fosters the acceptance and longevity of science-based \n\npolicies, targeting coastal sustainability (Hines, 2010). Early engagement has the additional \n\nbenefits of avoiding polarized positions, and helps to broaden consideration of issues.  \n\n3.3 Framing the message \n\n[This subchapter is based on: Carapu\u00e7o, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal \nchange: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] \n\nFraming also arises as another fundamental condition to overcome gaps in \ncommunication (Figure 2). Framing helps turning scientific data into meaningful \ninformation for the target audience. It involves encoding scientific findings into a simple \nand clear language, anticipating and eliminating likely causes of confusion and \nmisunderstanding, so that the audience can decode the message and understands the idea \nbeing conveyed. In the scope of the present study, language is defined as the manner in \nwhich scientific knowledge is traduced (coded) attending to the audience\u2019s specifies. It \nencompasses the discourse, images (including photographs and graphical representations) \nand indicators (further discussed in Chapter 4. Coastal indicators: a common language). \nFraming goes, however, beyond translating scientific data into a \u201ccommon\u201d language \nbetween scientists and their audiences. Framing also implies choosing the proper \nchannels of communication, i.e., the manner in which the message is, or will be, sent. \nCommunication channels include, among others, interpersonal communication, books, \naudio, video, websites and mobile applications (Estrada and Davis, 2015; Andrews et al., \n2005). Channels of communication can be used individually or combined in order to \nsupport narratives and storytelling and easily capture the audience\u2019s attention, to achieved \nincreased comprehension and to make the message more appealing (Dahlstrom, 2014).  \n\nFigure 9 depicts the importance of framing to successfully deliver the coastal message \nand highlights that scientists may now be facing a new paradigm: framing the message is \nno longer centered in the subject, but is shifting to be centered in (different types of) \naudiences.  \n \n\n\n\nFostering scientific knowledge transfer \n\n - 38 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 9. Scientists have to properly frame the coastal message to get it across and reach their \naudience. Once the content of the message is identified, scientists have to find the proper \nlanguage and channels of communication to make it understandable and appealing. This figure \nillustrates the different reactions from the audience when the scientist refers to wave energy in \nformal terms and when he properly frames his message attending to the audience\u2019 specificities.  \n\n \n\nAny coastal actor driven by the identification of a relevant coastal issue can trigger the \ncommunication process: \u201cCan we build here? Are their good waves for surfing in this \narea? Can I safely fish tomorrow?\u201d. Scientists themselves may identify important issues \nthat can compromise coastal sustainability (e.g., increasing storminess, destruction of \nhabitats, increasing erosion). Although scientific knowledge plays an important role in \nanswering these questions, \u201cscience itself\u201d is not sufficient to ensure that the answer is \nsuccessfully conveyed and understood. Scientists should preferably frame the message \nthemselves taking into account the needs of information and expectations of their \naudience (Doumont, 2010). As an alternative to making scientists accountable for the \ndesign of the whole communication process, knowledge brokers or boundary \norganizations can be integrated to assist and facilitate the task of framing the message \n(e.g., Cvitanovic et al., 2015; Dilling and Lemos, 2011; Vogel et al., 2007). Knowledge \nbrokers, also referred in the literature as linkage agents or professional facilitators (e.g., de \n\n\n\nFostering scientific knowledge transfer \n\n - 39 -  \n\nJonge and Giebels, 2015; Carapu\u00e7o et al., 2014a; Becheikh et al., 2010; Pielke, 2007; \nHuberman, 1990), are persons acting as intermediaries between scientists and non-\nscientists and are fluent in both worlds (Dilling and Lemos, 2011). They have been \nsuccessful in the U.S. Pacific Island region in \u201ccreating usable science\u201d under the scope \nof climate knowledge (Dilling and Lemos, 2011). A boundary organization serves the \nfunction of working between the worlds of research and of the use or application of \nscience. However, given their size and capacity, they may have more resources to tailor \ninformation and produce value-added products than individual brokers (Cash, 2001). \nUnder adverse circumstances both knowledge brokers and boundary organizations can \nbe further helpful in achieving consensus (for example, in overcoming difficulties in \ncoordination and cooperation between different parties involved in a coastal issue) or for \naccomplishing a project within narrow time boundaries. \n\nFraming the coastal message requires effort and this implies that scientists are engaged \nin the communication process. Framing is an unavoidable reality within the task of \nscientific knowledge dissemination. It helps to capture audiences\u2019 attention, makes the \nmessage understandable and assists scientists in communicating the relevance of their \nfindings (Bubela et al., 2009). Framing helps scientists to communicate why an issue may \nbe a problem, who or what might be responsible for it, and what should or could be \ndone.  \n\nChapter 3 |Key messages: \n\nv?

Earth-\nScience Reviews. DOI: 10.1016/j.earscirev.2016.01.002.] \n\n4. Coastal indicators: a common language \nScience communication poses additional challenges in finding a language adequate to \n\nfoster mutual understanding between sender and receiver. Whatever the language \nselected it must be comprehensible to the target audience and, simultaneously, ensure \nrigorous reporting.  \n\nSeveral international organizations forwarded guidelines on this matter and have \nstated that indicators constitute the most efficient way to transmit inherently complex \ninformation in a simplified and applicable form, allowing for the establishment of \nreference situations and quantitative assessment of evolution trends (e.g., EU, 2014; \nNOAA, 2010; UNESCO, 2006, 2003). In this sense, indicators arise as the universal \nlanguage in coastal science communication facilitating the dialog among coastal actors \n(e.g., NOAA, 2010). However, concerning the coastal zone, the development of \nindicators is still in an emergent stage. The aim of the present chapter is to present an \ninnovate contribution to the development of a common framework on coastal \ngeoindicators.  \n\n4.1 Motivation \n\nThe coastal zone is a complex environment that encompasses several \ngeomorphological features with specific dynamics. Beaches, in particular, are one of the \nmost mutable environments where morphologic variations can occur at a wide range of \ntemporal and spatial scales. Often, human interference with such a complex and dynamic \nsystem leads to negative impacts. To cope with coastal use-related conflicts, the \nintegration of scientific knowledge is of vital importance. To achieve this objective, \nseveral coastal monitoring programs aiming to deliver scientific data to the management \nprocess have been developed worldwide, with specific data acquisition procedures and \nreporting methods, according to their aims and scopes  (e.g., Lynch et al., 2014; Psuty et \nal., 2012; 2010; MESSINA, 2005; Bradbury et al., 2002). Though valid for the specific \nenvironments and objectives they were designed for, information derived from these \nprograms may not be suitable for use and comparison with other coastal areas. To \nimprove data sharing and comparability, it is important to promote procedures that \nenlarge the scope of applications of the acquired data with minimum additional effort, \nand provide data and information in a standardized form. Indicators have been put \nforward as the most efficient form to do so (e.g., Carapu\u00e7o, 2015b; NOAA, 2010).  \n\n\n\nCoastal indicators: a common language \n\n - 43 -  \n\nHowever, the coastal zone lacks a widely accepted and normalized framework of basic \ndefinitions, common designations and measurement criteria to assist in choosing a set of \ncoherent and consistent indicators to described the coastal state.  \n\n4.2 Scope \n\nThe environments and morphological domains herein considered are schematized in \nFigure 10. Their physical boundaries were defined aiming to make them useful for \ndifferent areas of expertise (e.g., coastal engineering, management, research), and are \ndefined as follow:  \n\nBeach: accumulation of wave reworked unconsolidated sediment (usually sand and/or \ngravel) extending from the closure depth to inland up to a physiographic change such as \na dune field or sea cliff or to the point where the permanent vegetation is established \n(Komar, 1983).  \n\nCoastal dunes: hills or ridges of sand deposited by the wind and/or wave action, or can be \nartificially deposited, and are often covered with beachgrass (NOAA, 1994).  \n\nCoastal barriers: a narrow low-lying strip of land consisting of beach and dunes extending \nparallel to the trend of the coast and separated from the mainland by a fresh, brackish or \nsalt water body or marsh (NOAA, 1994).  \n\n \n\nFigure 10. Sandy coast environments and morphological domains; underlined labels refer to \ncoastal geoindicators: CP - coastline position; SBCREST - shoreline based on the berm crest; \nSHWSL - shoreline based on the high water swash line; SMHW - shoreline based on the mean \nhigh water line. \n\n4.3 Definition and background  \n\nHistorically, the term indicator has been used as a statement with the ability to \nmeasure or describe variables; a parameter that indicates some characteristic or metric. \nOne of the commonly used definition of indicator is from UNESCO (2006): \u201cindicator is \na quantitative/qualitative statement or measured/observed parameter that can be used to \ndescribe an existing situation and measure changes and trends over time\u201d.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCoastal indicators: a common language \n\n - 44 -  \n\nAccording to Cobb and Rixford (1998), indicators have been used \u201csince the dawn of \nhistory, and the first reference of human\u2019s self-conscious use of indicators dates back to the 1830s referring \nto the judgment of social conditions using statistical indicators to improve public health and social \nconditions\u201d. Cohn, in 1899, refers to the use of indicators associated to the disciplines of \nchemistry and pharmacy. In the 20th century, indicators emerged in other areas: in the \n1920s, economic indicators, such as the gross domestic product (GDP), the rate of \ninflation, or public sector borrowing and debt, were considered essential tools to measure \nthe state of economies (Keating, 2001). More recently, in the 1970s, specific indicators \nwere developed and used in the description of the state of environment (SoE). In what \nconcerns to indicators related to the description of coastal features, the earliest reference \nis even more recent (Berger, 1996). A significant number of essays, reports and projects \nfocused on indicators in the scope of coastal zone management have since been \nproduced (e.g., SUSTAIN, 2012; Ciavola et al., 2011; Marchand, 2010; NOAA, 2010; \nEPA, 2008; Davidson et al., 2007; Mart\u00ed et al., 2007; van Koningsveld et al., 2007; UNEP, \n2006; UNESCO 2006, 2003; OECD, 2003; UAB-GIM, 2002; SECRU, 2001). Table 2 \npresents a chronological summary of the use of indicators to describe the SoE focusing \non the ones that describe the geomorphological state of the coastal environment. \n\nAnalysis of Table 2 leads to the conclusion that during the first years, SoE reporting \nfocused on gathering and reporting as much knowledge and information as possible. \nThese early reports constituted valuable reference works. However, they were extensive, \ntoo complex and almost impenetrable to anyone searching for a quick synopsis of key \nissues and trends (Keating, 2001). The demand for critical environmental snapshots was \nlater achieved through the use of indicators, and SoE reporting evolved from \nencyclopedic tomes to indicator-based reports, often grouped under specific issues (e.g., \nair and water quality). Concerning the state of the coast, geoindicators emerged in 1996 \nas high-resolution measures of short-term (<100 years) surface or near-surface changes \nin earth processes and phenomena that are significant for environmental monitoring and \nassessment (Berger, 1996). \n\nSince 2000, coastal indicators started to be developed and used as a tool to support \ncoastal management, aiming to promote the interaction between coastal researchers and \nmanagers in application-oriented knowledge-based development. Projects EUROSION \n(UAB-GIM, 2002); CoastView (CoastView Team, 2002; Davidson et al., 2007; van \nKoningsveld et al., 2007; Jim\u00e9nez et al., 2007), DEDUCE (Mart\u00ed, et al., 2007), \nCONSCIENCE (Marchand, 2010; Jim\u00e9nez, 2010), MICORE (Ciavola, 2011; Ciavola et \nal., 2011), SUSTAIN (SUSTAIN, 2012) and PEGASO (Santoro et al., 2014) are examples \nof efforts to enhance the integration of the results of scientific research in the process of \ncoastal decision-making through the use of coastal indicators. However, the indicators \nemerge from these studies were project- or site-specific and their performance limited to \nfew specific management settings, with little or no transferability potential to other \nrealities. \n\n\n\nCoastal indicators: a common language \n\n - 45 -  \n\nTable 2.

In response to this need, the IUGS established a working \ngroup to develop, what was designated as geoindicators. \n\n[4] \n\n1996/7 \n\nBerger (1996) presented the first definition of geoindicators. \n\nA list of geoindicators was compiled and made available in the internet in the IUGS \nwebsite.  \n\nGeoindicators are the first reference to indicators that aim to describe the state of \nthe coast, among other geo-environments. \n\n[4] \n\n2000s \n\n \n\nA series of coastal geomorphological indicators are described in the literature. \n\nSeveral projects use indicator-based approaches focused on coastal zone \nmanagement: EUROSION; CoastView; CONSCIENCE; DEDUCE; MICORE; \nSUSTAIN; PEGASO.  \n\ne.g.,[5] to [16] \n\n[17] to [24] \n\n2012 to present \n\nDespite the relevance of coastal indicators, indicator-based reports addressing \ndevelopment and implementation of climate change adaptation strategies, at \nnational and international levels, do not consider coastal indicators to describe the \nstate of the coastal zone.  \n\nThe adoption of coastal indicators is limited to a few management settings and \nparticular projects. \n\n[25] [26] \n\n[1] UNEP, 2006 [2] Keating, 2001 [3] WCED, 1987 [4] Berger, 1996 [5] Bush et al., 1999 [6]  SECRU, 2001 [7] CoastView \nTeam, 2002 [8] Diedrich et al., 2010 [9] EPA, 2008 [10] Harrington and Mooney-seus, 2007a [11] Harrington and Mooney-seus, \n2007b [12] Moore et al., 2006 [13] Ruggiero et al., 2013 [14] Sutherland, 2010 [15] van Koningsveld et al., 2005 [16] van Rijn, 2010 \n[17] Ciavola et al., 2011 [18] Davidson et al., 2007 [19] Marchand, 2010 [20] Mart\u00ed et al., 2007 [21] Santoro et al., 2014 [22] SUSTAIN, \n2012 [23] UAB-GIM, 2002 [24] van Koningsveld et al., 2007 [25] EEA, 2012 [26] EPA, 2014. \n\n4.4 Identified gaps \n\nThe appraisal of coastal indicators-related literature reveals that a myriad of indicators \nhave been used to report the state of the coastal environment. In this review, numerous \ninconsistencies in the reporting process were found, including the use of different \nindicators\u2019 designations to report the same geomorphological feature, the use of different \nindicators\u2019 categories for the same purpose and paradoxes in wording. Moreover, even \nthe meaning of the word \u201cindicator\u201d is not consensual. These discrepancies make an all-\ninclusive analysis on this topic an almost unfeasible task, especially when adopting a top-\ndown approach.  \n\n\n\nCoastal indicators: a common language \n\n - 46 -  \n\nFor example, attempting to compile a review on coastal indicators, using the key word \n\u201cindicator\u201d will exclude a significant number of contributions that have adopted other \ndesignations, such as \u201ccriteria\u201d (e.g., CZMA, 1972), \u201cindex\u201d (e.g., Bukata, 2005), \n\u201cparameter\u201d (e.g., Baptista et al., 2011), \u201cproxy\u201d (e.g. Farris and List, 2007), \u201cstandard\u201d \n(e.g., CZMA, 1972), \u201cvariable\u201d (e.g., Thieler and Hammar-Klose, 2000) and \u201cvital sign\u201d \n(e.g., NPS, 2005; Stevens et al., 2005), are excluded. This exclusion includes, for example, \nworks related to well-established and extremely valuable coastal monitoring programs \nthat rely upon indicator-based approaches (e.g., NPS, 2005). \n\nConcerning the categories of indicators, five designations were identified in literature: \ngeoindicators (Carapuc?o et al., 2013a; Bush and Young, 2009; Berger, 1997, 1996), coastal \nstate indicators (Marchand, 2010; Sutherland, 2010; van Rijn, 2010; van Koningsveld, \n2003), science coastal state indicators (Giardino et al., 2014; van Koningsveld et al., 2005; \nvan Koningsveld, 2003), issue-based coastal state indicators (van Koningsveld et al., 2005; \nvan Koningsveld, 2003), and geomorphological indicators (Bernatchez et al., 2011). \n\nAdditionally, different indicators were found to refer to the same target-features. For \nexample, the width of the beach is referenced to using three different designations: beach \nwidth (Marchand, 2010; Sutherland, 2010; van Rijn, 2010; Bush and Young, 2009; van \nKoningsveld et al., 2005; van Koningsveld, 2003; Bush et al., 1999), backshore width \n(Marchand, 2010; Sutherland, 2010) and berm width (van Rijn, 2010).  \n\nFurthermore, whereas some indicators are supported by very detailed measurement \ncriteria, in other cases the criteria have been poorly defined. Without this information, \nthe usefulness of indicators is prejudiced and transferability other realities very limited.  \n\nThis lack of specificity and consistency described above reflects the need for a \nnormalized scheme and calls for a standard approach describing the state of the coastal \nenvironment reporting through the use of indicators targeting universality, simplicity and \nunambiguity. \n\n4.5 Development of a common framework \n\nThe development of a common framework constitutes a first step towards the \nestablishment of a set of coastal geoindicators aiming and using a consensus-based \napproach. This effort is grounded in previous works, and relies upon a compromise that \naims to normalize indicator concepts and designations. \u201cGeoindicator\u201d is herein \nproposed as the most suitable term to encompass the category of indicators pertaining to \nsurface or near-surface changes in earth processes and phenomena, as discussed above \n(see 4.3 Definition and background). This designation is simultaneously the oldest and still \nin-use term having been original proposed by the IUGS (Berger, 1996).  \n\n\n\nCoastal indicators: a common language \n\n - 47 -  \n\n4.5.1 Indicator properties \n\nIndicators should share a set of fundamental characteristics in order to provide a \nsimplified form to communicate complex data and information among stakeholders. In \norder to assure relevance of the indicators, they must embed the following proprieties, \nand be:  \n\nSpecific: indicators should yield a clear representation of the system characteristic they are \nintended to reflect. \n\nMeasurable: indicators should be quantifiable. \n\nAchievable: indicators should rely upon implementation and collection methods that are \nfeasible with available resources and intellectual capital. \n\nRelevant: there must be a direct link between the indicator and the underlying key issue or \ntarget-question to be answered. \n\nTime-bound: indicators should be responsive to changes in time and provide timely \ninformation. \n\nThese characteristics have been put together under the acronym SMART (Specific, \nMeasurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound). SMART indicators play an important \nrole in result-based management strategies (MDF, 2005). Several organizations and \nauthors acknowledge these properties as the most relevant in indicators' selection in \norder to assure that they are comparable (e.g., NOAA, 2010; Sutherland, 2010; van Rijn, \n2010; UNESCO, 2006; OECD, 2003; CoastView Team, 2002).  \n\n4.5.2 The challenge \n\nThe process of simplification in reporting the state of the coastal environment using \nindicators poses a real challenge because of the local and often site-specific nature of the \ncoastal features and management issues addressed. For this reason, the adoption of a \ncommon measurement criterion, applicable worldwide and to different geomorphological \nsettings, can be controversial (e.g., NRC,1990) for further discussion on this topic). This \ndrawback is shared by all indicators and is particularly well documented in the case of the \nshoreline position (e.g., Galgano and Douglas, 2008; Boak and Turner, 2005; Byrnes et al., \n2003; Kraus and Rosati, 1997). In fact, this is one of the major reasons that have \nhindered the adoption of a common and widely accepted criterion that could be used at \nevery location of world\u2019s coast. However, and despite these difficulties, other scientific \nareas have shown that the process of simplification in reporting is not only a possible \ntask but also a vital one. For example, the GDP reports financial information from \ndifferent countries with very different realities, and despite the difficulties associated with \nits estimation and associated uncertainty (Xianchun, 2002), it has come to be a well-\nestablished and accepted indicator, useful to convey in a simple form a complex \neconomic setting, not only to economic professionals but also to non-experts. A similar \napproach was followed in this work, relying upon a compromise attitude among the \ndifferent schools of thought, targeting a consensus-based approach.  \n\n\n\nCoastal indicators: a common language \n\n - 48 -  \n\n4.5.3 A common framework \n\nA common framework on coastal geoindicators focusing on sandy coastal \nenvironments is presented in Table 3. The baseline information for this work includes a \nthorough analysis of the scientific papers and reports addressing coastal indicators and \nmetrics therein incorporated. From the literature analyzed, a total of forty-three \nindicators were found. However, in reality, they target only sixteen different coastal \nfeatures (Table 3) as several indicators with different names target the same issue \n(identified in Table 3 as \u201cOther common designations\u201d).   \n\nThe majority of the key issues addressed by indicators, as found in the literature, are \nrelated to \u201crisk assessment\u201d and \u201ccoastal protection\u201d (Table 3), a situation that highlights \nthe relevance of coastal indicators in providing useful information for coastal \nmanagement, in particular, and to society in more general terms.  \n\nThe proposed framework does not introduce additional designations, but derives \nfrom the application of the existing ones. In the cases where the same indicator has been \nreferred by more than one designation, the one that has a clear cross-discipline meaning \nprevailed.  \n\nThe proposed measurement criteria target a consensus-based approach, adopting the \nmost widely recognized standards and aiming to be globally assessable. For the majority \nof the indicators, it was possible to identify a single and rather consensual criterion. In \nthe case of the physical interface of land and water (sensu lato), related to coastline and \nshoreline concepts, it was not possible or suitable to achieve a consensus. In the present \nstudy, the coastline and shoreline are considered to be related to different morphological \nelements: the coastline position refers to the landward limit of the backshore (taken as \nthe toe position of the dune, cliff or structure confining the beach) (Figure 10) whereas \nshoreline refers to the physical interface of land and water (Dolan et al., 1991). The first \nconcept is more conservative in spatial location and useful for different purposes than \nthe latter. Additionally, in selecting an indicator concerning the shoreline position, it \nshould also be considered that data may derive from very different sources (e.g., field \nsurveys, LiDAR, historical maps, air photos, satellite and video imagery), and can be \neither feature-based (e.g., Psuty et al., 2010) or datum-based (e.g., Hess, 2003). To \novercome this obstacle without losing valuable information and, at the same time, to \neliminate confusion, it is suggested that the shoreline indicator designation should \ninclude the variable used.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCoastal indicators: a common language \n\n - 49 -  \n\nTherefore, it is proposed the adoption of the following proxies and notations for the \nshoreline indicator, according to the method of collection used (Figure 10): \n\nSBCREST: to be used when the shoreline is morphology-based. It is suggested the \nadoption of the active berm crest (BCREST) because it is a feature commonly used as a \nshoreline proxy (Kraus and Rosati, 1997) that can be extracted from topographic data. \n\nSHWL: to be used when the shoreline is imagery-based. It is suggested the adoption of \nthe high water swash line (HWSL), because high water line is the most commonly-used \nshoreline indicator (Boak and Turner, 2005). \n\nSMHW: to be used when the shoreline is elevation-based. It is suggested the adoption of \nthe mean high water (MWH) level because it matches a standard tidal datum (Hess, \n2003). \n\nThe measurements expressed in Table 3 are relative to cross-shore profiles and the \nunits are: length - L -, time - T - and qualitative - Q. \n\n \n\n\n\nCoastal indicators: a common language \n\n - 50 -  \n\nTable 3.

The major cause of the delay in \n\nthe generalized adoption of a widely accepted framework is the existence of a myriad of \n\nindicators that are frequently poorly defined. Inconsistences were found related with the \n\nindicators\u2019 designations, categories and measurement criteria. These shortcomings call for a \n\nstandardized approach in coastal indicators\u2019 measurement and reporting, targeting simplicity \n\nand unambiguity. To address this issue, a common framework for the establishment of \n\ncoastal geoindicators for sandy coast environments is proposed. Sixteen indicators are \n\nidentified as relevant for beach, coastal dune and coastal barrier environments. This effort \n\naims to contribute to the widespread adoption of coastal indicators as common language in \n\nthe dialogue between coastal actors.  \n\nChapter 4 |Key messages: \n\nv?

Mechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: \nfrom concept to implementation \n\nScientists can adopt different mechanisms to connect with their audience. Each \nmechanism provides a different route for scientists to link with the audience, leading to \ndifferent types of feedback. If adequately used, mechanisms to improve the transfer of \nscientific knowledge can foster engagement, minimize the framing effort and optimize \naudiences\u2019 feedback.  \n\nThe most widely known and adopted mechanism to transfer scientific knowledge is \noutreach (as formal education is beyond the scope of this work). However, scientists \nmust be aware that other means are also available: crowdsourcing, managers-oriented \ntools and co-production. These latter three mechanisms, although in earlier stages of \ndevelopment, are promising alternatives and should be considered as major opportunities \nto foster knowledge transfer. In this chapter the concept associated of each of the four \nmechanisms and examples of their application to real-world developed under the scope \nof this thesis are presented.  \n\n5.1 Outreach \n\nOutreach in coastal science aims to raise coastal literacy and awareness. These are \nimportant political and societal issues characterizing a knowledge-based society engaged \nwith science. Two outreach projects were developed in the scope of the present work: \n\u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d and \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for \nlearning\u201d. These projects focus on the two key-elements of beach dynamics, sand and \nwaves. The implementation of both projects returned valuable insights on the audience \nresponsiveness and also on to what extend lay audiences can effectively be motivated, \ninfluenced and engaged in coastal issues. \n\n5.1.1 The concept \n\nOutreach is a \"meaningful and mutually beneficial collaboration with partners in \neducation, business, public and social service. It represents that aspect of teaching that \nenables learning beyond the campus walls, that aspect of research that makes what we \ndiscover useful beyond the academic community, and that aspect of service that directly \nbenefits the public\" (Ray, 1999). Outreach aims at fostering public awareness and \nunderstanding of science, thus developing comprehension of both the meaning and \nknowledge implications (Burns et al., 2003).  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 55 -  \n\nIn outreach, the message to be conveyed can be framed resorting to a wide range of \nchannels of communication, including tutoring, giving formal presentations and also \nsupporting teachers, developing resources and so forth (Andrews et al., 2005).  \n\n5.1.2 \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d project \n\n[This subchapter is based on: Carapu\u00e7o, M.M., Taborda, R., Silveira, T.M., Andrade, C. 2016c. Upstream Public \nEngagement On Coastal Issues: Audience Response To A Science-Based Exhibition. In preparation] \n\n\u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d project was an outreach initiative \ndeveloped with the goal of upstream public engagement on coastal issues. It was the \noutcome of a collaborative initiative involving the Faculty of Sciences of University of \nLisbon, the Municipal Council of Cascais and the Portuguese Environmental Agency. \n\n5 . 1 . 2 . 1  M o t i v a t i o n   \n\nPublic understanding of coastal dynamics and coastal change is fundamental in \nsupporting the implementation of sustainable coastal strategies. However, in addition to \nthe challenges previously discussed in subchapters 3.2 Fostering engagement and 3.3 Framing \nthe message, when scientists address the dynamics of beach systems a further challenge \narises: preconceived ideas. For many people beaches are places of memories built during \nchildhood and emotional memories play an important role in the public response in later \nstages of life (Zadra and Clore, 2011). Perception of size of both objects and distances \nvaries substantially from childhood to, and over, later stages of life and both perceptions \nmay also differ from the true dimension of the entities brought to our conscience. The \ntrue dimension of the beach of our infancy is very often different from what we \nperceived it to be. Objects that we found gigantic in early stages of our existence were in \nfact considerably smaller (Banakou et al., 2013). This illusion is due to the size of the \nphysical world being perceived in relation to the size of the perceiver\u2019s body (Banakou et \nal., 2013; Linkenauger et al., 2010). For example, as a person grows and gets taller, fewer \nsteps and less effort are required to cover a certain distance (van der Hoort et al., 2011). \nThe sense of our own body affects how we visually experience the world and plays an \nimportant role in perceiving our surroundings and their dimensions. Traditionally, our \ninfancy memories recall us of larger and wider beaches. This leads to a sense of feeling \nand believing that beaches are getting smaller as we grow taller and older.  \n\nTo this size-illusion effect adds the human tendency to generalize and overvalue \nnegative things (Baumeister et al., 2001) and the notion that \u201cit was better in the good old \ndays\u201d. Media can also magnify this negative bias, as it often emphasizes bad news (e.g., \ncoastal erosion vs. coastal accretion). Research and its outputs are also generally focused \non erosional behavior as it dominates the evolutional trend of coastlines worldwide in the \nrecent past and because retreating coastlines are more prone to risk (e.g., Pilkey, 2008). \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 56 -  \n\nSociety perception of coastal evolution is built upon all the aforementioned biases. So \nit is natural that there is a generalized assumption that all beaches are eroding \u2013 even if \nthey are not. In fact, coastline evolution depends on many factors, including the \ngeomorphological setting, sediment budget and human intervention so, contrary to what \nis often deeply rooted in public [mis]perception, many coastal stretches are stable or \nunder accretion. The project \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d arose with the \naim of shifting the public perspective on the generalized assumption that all beaches are \neroding. \n\n5 . 1 . 2 . 2  A  s c i e n c e - b a s e d  e x h i b i t i o n  a s  a  p l a t f o r m  f o r  p u b l i c  e n g a g e m e n t  \n\nAn outdoor science-based exhibition, developed in the scope of this work, was the \nplatform designed to trigger public\u2019s attention and foster society engagement with coastal \nissues (Figure 11). The exhibition focused on the evolution of the beaches of Cascais \nmunicipality (Portugal) that have been mostly stable in the last decades and, in some \ncases, increased in area. Photographs taken from the early to mid-20th century and recent \nones were adopted as the language to convey a coastal message of \u201cbeach invariance\u201d, \naiming to shift the public perspective on the generalized assumption that all beaches are \neroding. \n\n \n\nFigure 11. \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d: project\u2019s audience, language, channel of \ncommunication and mechanism adopted to get the message across and reach the audience. \n\nS t u d y  a r e a  \n\nCascais is a cosmopolitan area with a high touristic demand located in the west coast \nof Portugal (Figure 12). Since the mid-19th century the beaches along the Cascais \ncoastline, the so-called Portuguese Sunshine Coast, have been very popular amongst \nthose who live in Cascais and Lisbon areas, and tourists all over the world. Today, most \nof Cascais\u2019 eighteen beaches still preserve much of their original charm, and remain one \nof the icons of this municipality.  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 57 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 12. Location of Cascais\u2019 beaches (Cascais, Portugal). \n\nBeaches of Cascais correspond mainly to small pocket sand beaches. On the landward \nside, these beaches are usually limited by low cliffs or manmade structures aiming to \nprotect sea front property or infrastructures (e.g., roads) and used for recreation purposes \n(e.g., seaside promenade). Cascais coastline can be divided in two littoral segments with \ndifferent orientation and contrasting wave exposure: a western segment, more exposed to \nthe prevailing northwest waves generated in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, where the \nbeaches of Abano, Guincho, \u00c1gua Doce and Cresmina are included; and a southern \nsegment, sheltered from the prevailing wave regime and thus experiencing a milder wave \nregime, encompassing the beaches from Santa Marta to Carcavelos (Figure 12).  \n\nAnalysis of aerial photographs, maps and historical postcards, dated from the early \n20th century to the present allowed deducing the past evolution of Cascais\u2019 beaches. It \nwas possible to identify changes in position of the shoreline in the vast majority of \nbeaches, related with seasonal to interannual variations in oceanographic forcing, but \nexcluding a perceptible long-term trend. Beach areas updrift of groins are exception to \nthis, and Moitas, Tamariz and Avencas beaches have experienced localized accretion \nfollowing the constructing of groins. Accretion lasted until the saturation of their \nretention potential (Carapu\u00e7o et al., 2012). The long-term stability of the beaches of \nCascais makes them an ideal study site to evaluate the influence of outreach initiatives \naiming to raise public understanding on coastal issues. In this case, the shift in peoples\u2019 \nopinion from the generalized assumption that all beaches are eroding to an \nunderstanding of long-term beach stability, regardless seasonal to interdecadal reversible \nchanges, can be a valuable indicator of successful receptivity and assimilation of \ninformation by the public. \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 58 -  \n\nAs a word of caution, it must be noted that the behavior of the Cascais beaches \nthroughout the last 100 years should not be straightforwardly used to forecast their \nevolution into the near future. There is an increasing consensus that an accelerating sea-\nlevel rise (SLR) scenario due to climate warming will have significant impacts on the \ncoastal zone (Church et al., 2013). For example, the work of Taborda and Ribeiro (2015) \nsuggest that, in relation to acceleration of SLR, a reduction in the exposed area of all \nCascais beaches is expected. \n\nT h e  e x h i b i t i o n  \n\nThe exhibition \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d focused on the changes of \nthe beaches along the Cascais coastline (Figure 13). The concept of the exhibition was \nthought to maximize public engagement. This objective was accomplished by adopting \nthe following strategies in framing the message:  \n\nLocation: the exhibition took place outdoor, in an attractive and pleasant seaside \npromenade where hundreds of people walk every day. This setting allowed reaching a \nwider audience and contacting in \"their own ground\u201d.  \n\nStorytelling: the narrative of the evolution of the beaches of Cascais was supported mainly \nupon the comparison of present-day photographs with ones from the early to mid-20th \ncentury. Supporting the narrative format on photographs allows audiences with different \nbackgrounds to \u201cfind the answer on their own\u201d. Not imposing a solution makes easier \nfor people to accept it and to retain their own findings.  \n\nDesign: large panels with appealing design, supported by large-format printed \nphotographs triggered the public attention.  \n\nThe exhibition was set up along the seaside promenade that starts at Cascais village \n(Figure 12) and consisted of thirty large prints (2x1m) (Figure 13).  Twenty-eight prints \nshowed the same beach as captured by old and recent photographs, with the pictures \ndisplayed side-by-side. One print displayed a map with the name and location of the \nbeaches, and another one contained a brief description of beach dynamics.  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 59 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 13. Images illustrating the exhibition \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d. \n\n \n\nOld photographs were entirely retrieved from the Cascais' Historical Municipal \nArchive because of authorship issues. Two photographs from each beach were selected, \nbased on the oldest age and the largest beach coverage, ensuring the needed print quality \nexcept for Guincho, Azarujinha, Bafureira and Carcavelos, because there was only one \nphotograph available fulfilling the aforementioned requisites. There were no available old \nphotographic records for the \u00c1gua Doce and Moitas beaches.  \n\nThe present-day photographs were taken by a professional photographer working for \nthe Municipal Council of Cascais (on the 21st and 22nd of May 2015), guided by the \nauthor of this work, aiming to reproduce, as closely as possible, the image captured by \nthe old records. The photographs were acquired from the same point of view of the old \npictures, except where the original location was no longer accessible either because of \ncliff retreat or coastal development. The stage of the tide was also taken into \nconsideration, and the timing of images acquisition selected so that the uncovered beach \narea in old and new pictures was broadly the same. \n\n  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 60 -  \n\nPhotographs displayed in the panels were complemented with small bilingual texts \n(Portuguese and English) describing the geomorphological and geographical setting of \neach beach, as well as noticeable architectural and social features. Texts avoided \nreferences to evolutionary trends allowing for the audience to infer their own conclusions \nabout the system behavior.  \n\nThe panels were installed on the 4th of June 2015, and the opening of the exhibition \ntook place the next day. The exhibition remained available to residents and those visiting \nCascais coast and beaches until the end of September 2015.  \n\n5 . 1 . 2 . 3  D r i f t i n g  f r o m  a s s u m p t i o n s  t o  u n d e r s t a n d i n g   \n\nThe impact of the exhibition on the public understanding about the evolution of \nCascais\u2019 beaches was assessed by a two-phase survey: a first phase took place just before \nthe exhibition and the second phase after people watching the panels. The survey was \nconducted anonymously and was based upon short and simple questionnaires available in \nPortuguese and English. A total of 682 answers were obtained (n=341 previous to the \nexhibition, and n=341 after the exhibition).

What other type of information about the Cascais beaches would you like to have \naccess?  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 61 -  \n\nThe first two questions were related with the participants\u2019 characteristics: their age and \nif they were living or visiting Cascais. Two questions followed aiming to assess the \npublic\u2019s familiarity with the coast of Cascais: participants were requested to indicate their \nfavorite beach and how many beaches exist in the Cascais municipality. The last question \nwas a closed-format and multiple-choice question about the perception on the evolution \nof the beaches of Cascais: beaches are increasing, stable or decreasing.  \n\nThe second phase of the survey took place during the exhibition, between June 22nd \nand August 13th 2015 (Table 4). This phase consisted of face-to-face interviews carried \nout at the exhibition site, targeting people that were observing the panels. A team of \nvolunteers, Mar\u00e9zinhas, clearly identified as working for the Municipal Council of Cascais, \nconducted these interviews. \n\nThe main objectives of the second phase of the survey were to collect a sample size \nequal to the first phase and to increase the level of detail provided in the previous phase \nthe multiple-choice question about the perception on the state of the beaches. The \nchange on the questions about beach evolution was based upon the fact that the \nparticipants were in situ, and watching photographs off the beaches concern. This made \nthe three response options made available in the first phase somewhat limitative. Thus, \nfive options of response for the same question were made available in the second phase \n(see Table 4). Two other items were added in the second questioners. Participants were \nasked if the use of old and present-day photographs was an adequate framing option to \nillustrate beach evolution, and why. Participants were also requested to express their \nopinion concerning other type of information on the Cascais beaches that they would \nlike to access. Both these two latter questions created the opportunity for participants to \nexpress their opinion and share ideas.  \n\nThe results of the survey were all compiled in electronic format and organized for \ndata analysis. Data management and processing was done using IBM\u00ae SPSS\u00ae Statistics \nand ESRI\u00ae ArcGIS applications. Pearson\u2019s chi-square test was used to test the \nindependency of the variables.  \n\nB e f o r e  t h e  e x h i b i t i o n :  a p p r a i s i n g  a s s u m p t i o n s   \n\nRegarding the first phase of the survey 68% of 341 participants lived in Cascais and \n32% were visitors. The majority (49.6%) were 31 to 50 years old and those were followed \nby those with more than 50 years of age (25.5%); 23.5% of the participants were between \n18 and 30 years old, and only 1.5% were under 18. Guincho was voted the favorite beach \nof Cascais, followed by Carcavelos (Figure 14). These beaches are the widest of Cascais, \nand are very popular for surf and other water-related sports. Less favorite beaches, \u00c1gua \nDoce and Santa Marta, correspond to very small beaches, only reachable during low tide.  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 62 -  \n\nAbout 36% of the respondents answered that the number of beaches in Cascais \nranges from 15 to 20, followed by 35% that responded 10 to 15 beaches. As the Cascais \ncoastline encompasses 18 beaches, these results showed that the majority of the audience \nhad a fair good perception about the number of beaches.  \n\n \nFigure 14. Favorite Cascais beach according to the results of the survey. \n\n \n\nConcerning beach evolution, the majority of the audience (57.8%) believed that the \nbeaches in this municipality were decreasing (meaning that beaches have been losing \nsand); 38.7% answered that Cascais\u2019 beaches were stable, and only a small percentage \n(3.5%) answered that beaches were increasing (Figure 15).  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 63 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 15.

Almost half of the participants were over 50 years old \n(49.3%), and 21.4% were between 31 to 50 years old. About 15.2% of the responders \nwere under 18 years, and 14.1% were between 18 and 30 years.  \n\nAfter watching \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d exhibition, the opinion of \nthe audience concerning the evolution of the beaches of Cascais was as follows: 36.1% \nanswered that the beaches were increasing (all increasing - 15%; and majority increasing - \n21.1%); 34.9% responded that beaches were stable; and 29% that beaches were \ndecreasing (all decreasing - 5.3% and majority decreasing - 23.8%). This opinion is shared \nby those living and visiting Cascais and amongst respondents with different ages. \n\nFigure 16 shows the comparison of the results on the public perception on beach \nevolution before and after the exhibition.  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 64 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 16. People\u2019s opinion concerning the evolution of the beaches of Cascais before and after \nthe exhibition. \n\nThere was a noticeable change in public opinion regarding perception of trends in \nbeach change: before the exhibition most people believed that beaches were decreasing \n(57.8%), while after watching the exhibition most people considered that beaches are \nstable or increasing (34.9% and 36.1%, respectively). Pearson\u2019s chi-square test was \nperformed to compare the data acquired before and after the exhibition (Figure 16) and \nthe result was found to be highly significative (test statistics 124.4; p &lt;0.001). The shift \nin public opinion indicates the successful transfer of science-based information to the \npublic and highlights that the goal of the exhibition was attained.  \n\nThe use of old and present-day photographs to illustrate beach evolution was \nconsidered adequate by a large majority (93.3%) of the participants, while only 2.6% \nconsidered this media inadequate. \u201cAllowing observing beach evolution\u201d, \u201cBeautiful and useful\u201d, \nand \u201cIt presents additional information related with other issues (historical, architectural)\u201d illustrate \ncomments related to this question. These results indicate that photographs performed \nwell as a good language supporting the narrative.  \n\nConcerning the last item of the questionnaire the majority of the responders \ncommented that the information portrayed by the exhibition was adequate. Nevertheless \nsome people made comments outside of the scope of the exhibition mentioning that they \nwould like to have easier access to information on quality issues (water and sand quality \nparameters) and to the history of the beaches of Cascais (heritage, architecture).  \n\nA 7-minute movie compiling the several elements of the \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: \npast and present\u201d exhibition and these results is available in the website: \nhttp://beachphotomonitoring.campus.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/movie.html. \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 65 -  \n\n5 . 1 . 2 . 4  C o n c l u s i o n s   \n\nCommunicating beach dynamics to the public is a difficult task. Challenges arise, not \nonly related with the need to capture the public\u2019s attention to science, but also in dealing \nwith people\u2019s assumptions. \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d exhibition was \ndesigned to upstream public engagement on coastal issues. The exhibition concept \nconsidered location, storytelling and design as key framing strategies in overcoming the \nchallenges faced by communicating science to the public. A survey conducted before the \nexhibition reveals that the majority of the public believed that the beaches of Cascais \nwere under erosion. However, after watching the exhibition, the public\u2019s perspective on \nthe evolution of Cascais beaches shifted towards stability and accretion trends, a \nperspective in line with their real long-term trend. Results show that the \u201cThe Beaches of \nCascais: past and present\u201d exhibition was a highly valuable science outreach initiative as it \ncontributed to raise public understanding about the coastal system.  \n\n5.1.3  \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for learning\u201d project \n\n \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for learning\u201d project was developed with the goals of \nraising ocean literacy and capture the attention of young students (in particular) and \nsociety (in general) to the importance of scientific knowledge integration in ocean and \ncoastal management. This project was developed in the framework of the present thesis \nby the Faculty of Sciences of University of Lisbon and was funded by the European \nEconomic Area Financial Mechanism in the framework of the Programme PT02 \u2013 \nIntegrated Marine and Coastal Water Management (#PT02_2\u00baRPS_0008).  \n\n5 . 1 . 3 . 1  M o t i v a t i o n   \n\nOcean and coastal management face relevant sustainability challenges. It is consensual \nthat a wiser governance of both environments can only be achieved by the involvement \nof all key actors. In this scope scientists, as knowledge generators, have a vital role in \ntransferring their knowledge and in raising awareness and understanding beyond the \nscientific community. The project \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for learning\u201d was \ndesigned with the purpose of transferring scientific knowledge about the physics of \nwaves using the Nazar\u00e9 Wave as the trigger, a gigantic wave that takes place at Norte \nbeach (central western Portuguese coast, Portugal, ) (Carapu\u00e7o et al., 2016d). Moreover, \nwaves are not only important by themselves but also represent a dominant source of \nenergy in the nearshore zone. Wave energy is ultimately the driving force behind coastal \nmorphological change (Masselink and Huges, 2003).  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 66 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 17.

This \noption was based upon the fact that this particular wave has recently became quite \nfashionable, appealing to the spirit of adventure of youngsters and thus revels to easily \ncapture the attention of the target-audience: high-school students. \n\nStorytelling: short scientific animations where blend in \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave\u201d movie \nvoice-over by high-school students. Students\u2019 discourse and the movie were combined \nand used as the communication channels to support the narrative. This choice was based \nupon the fact films are seen as one of the media that easily captures the audience\u2019s \nattention (e.g., Ismaili, 2015; Xhemaili, 2013) (Figure 18). \n\nMaking audience a part of the process: a group of forty-six high-school students were \nchallenged to actively contribute to the project, including performance takes in the \u201cThe \nNazar\u00e9 Wave\u201d movie (Figure 19).  \n\nNazar\u00e9 submarine canyon \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 67 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 18. \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for learning\u201d: project\u2019s audience, language, channel of \ncommunication and mechanism adopted to get the message across and reach the audience. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 19.

Here, the submarine morphology is complex \nand dominated by the presence of the Nazar\u00e9 submarine canyon that deeply incises the \ncontinental shelf. When incident waves correspond to long period Northwest and West \nswells, the particular geomorphological setting of the continental shelf strongly modifies \nthe nearshore wave pattern (IH, 2016; Silva, 2014). This modification leads to an \nabnormal and localized increase of wave height in relation to the cumulative effects of \nshoaling, convergence and interference culminating in gigantic breakers when the deep-\nwater wave height is already large. \n\nAs Nazar\u00e9 Wave became a very popular subject in the media and social networks it \nhas drawn the interest of society and in particular, of young students. The reason for \nsuch popularity is that the Nazar\u00e9 Wave is considered to be the highest wave ever surfed \naccording to Guinness World Records. Here, it is mentioned that on the 1st November \n2011, Garrett McNamara surfed a circa 24 m-high wave. Offshore conditions on that day \nwere 5.3 m wave height, 13.8 s wave peak period and wave direction of 307\u00b0 (Silva, \n2014).

Taking the impact of films in capturing \naudiences, short scientific animations illustrating the physical processes affecting the \nNazar\u00e9 Wave (generation, propagation, refraction, shoaling, convergence, interference \nand breaking) and the influence of the Nazar\u00e9 submarine canyon in modulating the local \nwave patterns (Silva, 2014) were merged into the \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave\u201d movie to get the \nscience content of the message across.   \n\nThe participation of the audience in the project was materialized by the inputs of \nforty-six students of the 10th grade and three Science teachers of Escola Secund\u00e1ria de Gama \nBarros (Cac\u00e9m, Portugal). Besides performing in \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave\u201d movie, students and \nschoolteachers helped scientists to build the concept of the project and commented \nseveral drafts of the scripts (written by scientists) assuring that the language was \ncomprehensible and that the essential principles and fundamental concepts of waves \nreached the audience. They also and actively participated in the dissemination of the \nproject, namely by participating in scientific meetings given interviews to regional \nnewspapers and by more informally using social networks. \n\nT h e  m o v i e  \n\nThe principal output of project \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for learning\u201d is a 5-\nminute movie entitled \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave\u201d available at the YouTube platform since 15th \nFebruary 2016 (Figure 20).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20.

The Nazar\u00e9 Wave was an excellent \ntrigger to capture students\u2019 attention to science and highlighted the importance of \nscientific knowledge transfer between scientists and society (in a broad sense). \nAdditionally to the theme itself, it was found that short scientific animation videos on \nbasic wave dynamics performed very well as the communication channel re-enforcing the \nadvantages of using movies to enhance student\u2019s motivation and understanding. \u201cThe \nNazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for learning\u201d revealed to be a highly successful outreach initiative \nand similar strategies adopted can be used in the development of other science \ncommunication projects.  \n\nChapter 5.1 | Key messages \n\nv? Outreach aims at fostering public awareness and understanding of science.  \n\nv? Two outreach projects were developed: \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d and \n\u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for learning\u201d. In both cases, the message was carefully \nframed attending to audiences\u2019 specificities. Both initiatives cases were highly successful.  \n\nv?  \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d exhibition was successful in contributing to \nraise public understanding about the coastal system, and allowed to shift peoples\u2019 beliefs \nabout beach evolution. \n\nv? \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave\u201d movie had over 6.000 views in the first month of its release and, \nafter three months, had been seen in more than 95 countries and was promoted in more \nthan 30 platforms demonstrating excellent performance of the selected languages and \nchannel of communication.  \n\nv? Outreach efforts can be highly valuable in moving forward public engagement and are \nmajor opportunities in developing a knowledge-based society. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 71 -  \n\n5.2 Crowdsourcing  \n\nCrowdsourcing has the objective of involving of a high number of people in the \ngeneration of large sets of data. Although still in its early stages of development, this \nmechanism presents a high potential on society engagement. Moreover, crowdsourcing \ncan influence on the success of a wide range of projects (Stiver et al., 2015). In the \nframework of the present study the \u201cCascais Beach Photo Monitoring\u201d project was \ndesigned and have been conducted since May 2015.  \n\n5.2.1 The concept \n\nCrowdsourcing can be descried as an open call for voluntary assistance from a large \ngroup of individuals (Kalil and Wilkinson, 2015). Crowdsourcing benefits society by \nencouraging society to participate in the scientific process by collecting data and helping \nin advance scientific knowledge (Kalil and Wilkinson, 2015). Some initiatives under the \nCitizen Science framework have already been developed namely in the context of public \nparticipatory monitoring (e.g., Tulloch et al., 2013; Stojanovic and Ballingerv, 2009), and \nvolunteered geographical information by the development of mapping tools and web \napplications (Leidig and Teeuw, 2015). Citizen Science is a broad term, covering a part of \nopen science in which citizens can participate in the scientific research process in \ndifferent possible ways: as observers, as funders, in identifying images or analyzing data, \nor providing data themselves (SCU, 2013).  \n\nCrowdsourcing and Citizen Science are powerful approaches for engaging the public \nin the scientific process and in addressing societal needs. Multiple benefits of these \napproaches include increased knowledge, positive impact on the participants in terms of \nenhancing their [coastal] awareness, empowerment and improved communication \nbetween the actors involved, and better adherence to [coastal] regulations (Holdren, \n2015; Wagner, 2004).  \n\n5.2.2 \u201cCascais Beach Photo Monitoring\u201d project  \n\nBeach photo monitoring consists on the systematic acquisition of photographs \ntargeting the beach area. The Coastal Photo Monitoring project is an example of a \ncrowdsourcing initiative, conducted in Australia by volunteers, since 2006, aiming at \nproviding a visual record of changes of priority sites within the Southern Perth \nMetropolitan coastal zone (Perth Region NMR, 2016). Results available at the website of \nthe CPM project depict morphological changes occurred in the study areas and are \nreadily noticeable and perceived by people with different backgrounds (both scientists \nand non- scientists).  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 72 -  \n\nThe CPM project and the \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d exhibition (sub-\nchapter 5.1.2) highlight the importance of using images (photographs) as the language to \ncommunicate beach dynamics. Based upon these initiatives, the Cascais Beach Photo \nMonitoring (CBPM) project was developed and has been conducted from May 2015 \nonwards. This project aims to be a proof of concept approach designed to demonstrate \nthe feasibility of systematic acquisition of photographs to support the development of a \ncrowdsourcing tool targeting beach monitoring. The CBPM project was developed upon \nthe mutual agreement between the Faculty of Sciences of University of Lisbon and the \nMunicipal Council of Cascais, that it was interesting to establishing guidelines towards \nthe development of a crowdsourcing tool helping supporting a beach photo monitoring \nprograms while, at the same time, upstream public engagement on coastal issues. \n\n5 . 2 . 2 . 1  M o t i v a t i o n   \n\nOne key element in coastal zone management is correct understanding of coastal zone \nevolution. However, the evaluation of morphological changes of a coast, namely beaches, \nis a non-trivial task due to the complex and intrinsically non-steady nature of the coastal \nprocesses (Taborda and Silva, 2012). Beach monitoring, the continuous or periodic \nprocess of collecting and analyzing data to measure the dynamic of the beach (UNESCO, \n2006), should be see as an integral and continuing element of the coastal management \nagenda, because it provides to managers regular feedback on implementation and \nprogress towards the attainment of environmental objectives. However, some \nmonitoring programs fail due to lack of capacity to assure the continuity of data \nacquisition. In this context, crowdsourcing arises as a major opportunity in enhancing \nand accelerating scientific research through co-generation of data. For instance, \nvolunteers can collect data over large areas and long periods of time, and sometimes \nincrease the frequency of observations, in ways that coastal management agencies or \nresearch institutions may not be able to do, given geographic and resource constraints \n(Holdren, 2015). In addition, this author highlights that community-based monitoring led \nto improved links amongst the actors involved, a vital step towards sustainability. \n\nDifferent fields of knowledge are at present developing crowdsourcing platforms to \nsupport research and foster engagement among participants. In the program did you feel \nit? volunteers report experiences felt during earthquakes using a web platform of the U.S. \nGeological Survey, providing \u201ca collection of citizen science data\u201d. The National Oceanic \nAnd Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\u2019s mPING mobile application, allows for \nvolunteers to submit weather-related observations, appealing that \u201cWe need your weather \nreports for our research!\u201d.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 73 -  \n\nIn the scope of beach photomonitoring, the Photomon application, developed by the \nNorthern Agricultural Catchments Council, was designed to support systematic \nacquisition and storage of photographs in order to improve the quality of data collected \nby environmental [beach] photo monitoring programs. Recently, in March 2016, the code \nof this application became publically available, and this allowed for its adoption in the \nscope of other beach monitoring programs.  \n\nThe above emphasizes the potential of beach photomonitoring initiatives supported \nby crowdsourcing and in upstream public engagement.  \n\n5 . 2 . 2 . 2  P r o j e c t  d e v e l o p m e n t   \n\nThe development of the CBPM project encompasses four main tasks: \n\nTask #1: which implies a 1-year systematic acquisition of photographs targeting the \nbeaches of Cascais (Portugal) (Figure 12) to test and validated photographs as a good \nmean to assess short- to medium-term morphological changes of the beach of Cascais.  \n\nTask #2: the development of approaches to extract costal geoindicators from \nphotographs.  \n\nTask #3: the development of a smartphone application to support crowdsourcing \nbeach photomonitoring.  \n\nTask #4: the development of web-based platforms to archive and to allow access to \nacquired photographs and other outputs of the CBPM project.  \n\nIn the scope of the present thesis, efforts were performed targeting the \nimplementation of Task #1 that has been conducted from May 2015 to July 2016 so far. \nSystematic acquisition of photographs targeting the eighteen beaches of Cascais (Figure \n12) was performed on a monthly basis. Two additional surveys were performed on 20th \nand 30th October 2015 to assess post-storm morphological changes. The methods and \nprocedures adopted during the surveys were based on the works of Carapu\u00e7o et al., \n2014b, DaSilva, 2012 and Silveira et al., 2012 and are the following:   \n\nPhoto monitoring points: a monitoring point was selected for the acquisition of each \nphotograph. The establishment of the viewpoint network took into consideration \naccessibility and the field of view - a good perspective of the target area and, if possible, \nof the entire beach. In every field campaign, the objective was to acquire photographs \nfrom the same points and with the same field of view. Beside a standard photograph of \neach beach, a panoramic photograph (with elongated field of view) was also acquired.  \n\nEquipment: a Nikon\u00ae D90 digital single-lens reflex camera equipped with a Nikon\u00ae \n18-200 mm vibration-reduction lens features 12.1-megapixel was used. The camera was \nset with automatic focus, and a focal length of 18 mm. For the acquisition of panoramic \nphotographs, 8-megapixixel digital camera of an iPhone 5s was used.  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 74 -  \n\nPeriodicity and stage of the tide: field surveys were taken at low tide on a monthly basis \nfrom May 2016 to July 2016 (as an example, Abano beach photographs are presented in \nFigure 22). In addition, after the 17th October 2015 storm that hit the Cascais coast, two \nadditional surveys were carried out on October 20th and 30th (as an example, S\u00e3o Pedro \nbeach photographs illustrating pre- and post-storm conditions are presented in Figure \n23). \n\nArchiving: after each campaign, photographs were named using a previously agreed \ncode (P1: Abano to P18: Carcavelos), the name of the beach, and the date of the \nphotograph (e.g., P1_abano_2015mai21.jpg). Photographs were also tagged with the \nname of the beach allowing constructing flexible and easy metadata that made the \npictures easily searchable. \n\nData availability: photographs are available in Flickr, an image and video hosting web \nplatform. In addition, results from monthly surveys are also available in a University of \nLisbon website: Beach Monitoring.  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 75 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 22.

Examples herein presented (Figure 22 and Figure 23) for the beaches of \nCascais, revels that photographs illustrated both seasonal variations that took place at \nAbano as well as storm erosion and post-storm recovery that took place at S\u00e3o Pedro do \nEstoril. Moreover, the information portrayed by the image conveys additionally \ninformation useful to understand and evaluate major morphodynamic drivers, such as \nincident wave characteristics.  \n\nResults achieved also highlight the potential of the CBPM project to support the \nwidespread use of simple photogrammetric techniques can upgrade the acquired \ninformation from qualitative to quantitative allowing to extract costal indicators (Task \n#2) following the work of Carapu\u00e7o et al., 2014.  \n\nIn addition, as beach monitoring will largely benefit from the involvement of \nvolunteers in the enlargement of data sets which can be of vital importance in cases \nwhere coastal agencies are not be able to assure the longevity of coastal monitoring \nprograms, crowdsourcing can be considered as a valuable resource in beach monitoring. \nFurthermore, crowdsourcing can, not only upstream public engagement on coastal \nissues, but also benefit from society\u2019s local knowledge enhancing the value of the outputs \ncoastal monitoring programs and further enriching the value of crowdsourcing as a \nmechanism to improve knowledge transfer (Figure 24) (stressing the importance of Task \n#3). \n\nMoreover, in moving forward the development and adoption of crowdsourcing tools \n(beach- or non-beach related), it should be underlined the need for easy access to the \ndata collected and related-outputs. If society is willing to participate in crowdsourcing the \ndata, information and knowledge generated should be open, and easy to, access. The \ndevelopment of web-based platforms (Task #4) arises as the simplest and low-cost \nsolution to assure that these conditions are meet. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 24. \u201cCascais Beach Photo Monitoring\u201d: project\u2019s audience, language, channel of \ncommunication and mechanism adopted to get the message across and reach the audience. \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 78 -  \n\n5.2.3 Conclusions  \n\nCrowdsourcing covers a part of open science in which society can participate in the \nscientific research of the coastal zone by providing data. Further benefits of this \napproach include strengthening and reinforcing the links amongst all actors involved (see \nThe Coastal Knowledge Triangle (Figure 1)): society benefits from having an active role in the \ncoastal management framework, leading to empowerment; scientists, policy-makers and \nmanagers benefit from the [co]generation of data, increasing the longevity of monitoring \nprograms enhancing management and scientific research.  \n\nIn the scope of beach monitoring, crowdsourcing is still in its early stages of \ndevelopment. However, existing initiatives as the Coastal Photo Monitoring (Perth \nRegion NMR, 2013) and Photomon (NACC, 2014) are positive signs of change towards \na wider adopting of beach monitoring supported in crowdsourcing tools. Both examples \nare photographs-related reinforcing the importance of images in a simple identification \nof beaches changes. Results of the CBPM project highlighted this same conclusion. \nMoreover, images are also considered a \u201cuniversal language\u201d being also very useful in \ncommunicating beach dynamics and evolution to different audiences. Altogether, these \nresults suggest that scientists should support the development of image-related \napproaches to foster the use of crowdsourcing tools. It is expected that in the near future \nthese tools can constitute a valuable complement to official (and traditional) coastal \nmonitoring programs as they can provide high resolution (both in time and space) data at \na very low cost-benefit ratio. \n\nChapter 5.2 |Key messages \n\nv? Crowdsourcing can be a valuable mechanism the in scientific knowledge transfer as it \nencourage the participation of society in the scientific process.   \n\nv? Crowdsourcing can strengthen and reinforce the links amongst the actors\u2019 involved, \nwhich can encompass all key coastal actors identified in The Coastal Knowledge Triangle \n(Figure 1). \n\nv? Crowdsourcing can have a major positive impact in supporting beach photo monitoring \nprograms while, at the same time, upstream public engagement on coastal issues. \nMoreover, crowdsourcing can not only increasing the frequency of observations, but also \ncontributing to reducing costs associated with coastal monitoring. \n\nv? Preliminary results from \u201cCascais Beach Photo Monitoring\u201d emphasize that photographs \nare a valuable resource in beach monitoring as they easily provide a reliable qualitative \nidentification of beach changes.  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 79 -  \n\n5.3 Management-oriented tools \n\nThe coastal management community has specific needs of information that is required \nto address specific management issues (e.g., Goldsmith et al., 2015; Carapu\u00e7o et al., 2013b; \nvan Koningsveld et al., 2005). This principle drives the development of management-\noriented tools as a mechanism to improve scientific knowledge transfer. More than \nproviding access to coastal data, management-oriented tools aim to turn data into helpful \nand readily usable information. In this chapter \u201cWave Transformation Matrices\u201d are \npresented as a management-oriented tool for computing site-specific nearshore wave \ncharacteristics. \n\n5.3.1 The concept \n\nManagement-oriented tools are designed to support the generation of specific \ninformation directly useful to policy-makers and managers. The largest compilation of \ncoastal management-oriented tools is \u201cThe Digital Coast\u201d (NOAA, 2016) a web platform \n\u201cdeveloped to meet the unique needs of the coastal management community\u201d. This \nplatform provides access to a significant number of science-based GIS (Geographic \nInformation System) tools capable of generating spatial information targeting different \ncoastal issues. Available tools include web applications to compute the rate of shoreline \nchange, and to create maps of potential ecological, social, and economic impacts from \nrising seas and changing climate. Despite any coastal actor can use these tools their \npurpose is to directly support coastal management. \n\n5.3.2 \u201cWave Transformation Matrices\u201d \n\nThe use of wave numerical models constitutes an eminently cost-effective, efficient, \nand rational approach to generating the desired estimates of wave parameters for a \nspecific end (Panchang et al., 1999). However, the process of transforming several \nthousands of individual wave recordings from deep-water to the nearshore can be a \nweighty and time-consuming procedure. Wave transformation matrices (WTM) \nconstitute a more efficient method to achieve similar objectives, as they are able to \nproduce forecast products for the oceanographic parameters and make them timely \navailable.  \n\n5 . 3 . 2 . 1  D e f i n i t i o n  a n d  g o a l   \n\nDelivering accurate nearshore wave data and information to coastal managers is of \nparamount importance in coastal zone management, namely to support the development \nand routine operation of beach activities, water sports and warning systems for coastal \nstorms.  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 80 -  \n\nHowever, in most cases, wave data and information is only accessible as 1) deep-water \nwave data sets requiring further processing to account for wave transformation during \npropagation and breaking, 2) refraction and diffraction diagrams picturing transformation \nof a limited number of previously selected wave conditions, and 3) extensive lists of \nnumbers on diverse wave attributes computed from increasingly complex numerical \nmodels. These \u201cformats\u201d are very difficult (if not impossible) to use by managers in their \ndaily activities. Moreover, often, the physical processes and uncertainty involved in \nprocessing wave data from the offshore to the coast are frequently hindered. This may \nlead to a decrease of trust in scientific results, which can be triggered, for example, by \ncases where forecasts depart from observations (Carapu\u00e7o et al., 2014d).  \n\nA WTM is a look-up table prepared to quickly deliver elementary nearshore wave \nparameters (Deltares, 2016). It consists of graphical solutions for computing site-specific \nnearshore wave characteristics, yielding results at an accuracy level compatible with most \nof the needs related with management of the coastal area and risks. Here, the \nperformance of different modeling strategies considering standard bi-dimensional (2D) \nWTM, and three-dimensional (3D) WTM, is presented. The approach developed in this \nwork was applied to the characterization of nearshore wave regime for a sector of the \nwestern Portuguese coast. \n\n5 . 3 . 2 . 2  P h y s i c a l  b a c k g r o u n d  \n\nAs waves propagate from deep to shallow waters, they experience changes in height \nand direction of travel due to the uneven bathymetry and coastal sheltering (as illustrated \nin the movie \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave\u201d, sub-chapter 5.1.3.2). The primary processes affecting \nwave propagation are shoaling, refraction and diffraction (CERC, 2002). Wave shoaling \nis the change in wave height when they enter shallower water. Wave refraction is the \nbending of the wave crest due primarily to depth changes and can result in convergence \nor divergence of the wave energy. Diffraction of waves is a phenomenon in which energy \nis transferred laterally along the wave crest. As waves move into shoaling water they \neventually become unstable and break. Wave breaking is the prominent method of wave \nenergy dissipation but waves also lose energy due to bottom friction when they propagate \nover intermediate and shallow waters (FEMA, 2005). Refraction, shoaling and diffraction \nare phenomena that have been approached and studied as linear problems and are \nresolved in the same manner by numerical models (Fassardi, 2004).   \n\n  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 81 -  \n\nT h e  s t a n d a r d  a p p r o a c h  t o  W T M   \n\nIn standard approach to WTM the nearshore wave height (H) at a specific depth is \nassumed to be linearly proportional to the deep-water wave height (H0) (Fassardi, 2004). \nThis is an important consideration because it assumes that the wave transformation \nprocess is independent from H0 and thus allows to estimate H considering only the deep-\nwater wave period (T0) and deep-water wave direction (Dir0). Using this approach, a wave \nheight transformation coefficient (WTCH) can be defined by the ratio between H and H0 \n(Fassardi, 2004):  \n\nWTCH = H/H0  (equation 1) \n\nThis coefficient can be estimated by the product of the shoaling (Ks) and refraction \n(Kr) coefficients, which depend only on T0 and Dir0: \n\nWTCH = f (T0, Dir0) = Ks \u00d7 Kr (equation 2) \n\nNearshore wave direction (Dir) can be estimated by a similar processes as it also \ndepends on T0 and Dir0:  \n\nDir = f (T0, Dir0) (equation 3) \n\nAs in linear wave theory the wave period (T) remains unchanged during propagation, \nthe nearshore wave period equal the deep-water wave period (T0): \n\nT = T0 (equation 4) \n\nFrom the above it is possible to conclude that all relevant nearshore wave parameters \ncan be estimated using only two independent variables: T0 and Dir0. This approach \nsupports the use of 2D WTM (a 2D matrix for wave height - WTMH and a 2D matrix for \ndirection - WTMDir) to transfer deep-water wave conditions to the nearshore (Figure 25).  \n\n \n\n \n \n\na) 2D WTMH b) 2D WTMDir \n\nFigure 25.

In the case of polychromatic waves, the sea state is described \nusing standard wave parameters (e.g., significant wave height (Hs), peak period (Tp) and \nmean wave direction (Dir)). In this case, the WTMH and WTMDir must be estimated using \na spectral wave model. In addition, when waves are polychromatic significant changes in \nwave period may occur such as when propagating in sheltered coastal sections or areas of \nconvergence/divergence. In these cases, the use of equation 4 can lead to significant errors \nand a wave transformation matrix for period (WTMT) should be considered. \n\n \n\na) 2D WTMT \n\nFigure 26. Bi-dimensional wave transformation matrix for period: 2D WTMT. \n\nFurthermore, in the standard approach H is considered linear dependent of H0. In \nshallow water, this assumption can lead to relative large errors in cases where breaking \nand bottom friction are important. Under these circumstances, H0 should be considered \nexplicitly in the transformation matrix. Three-dimensional WTM (3D WTM) are herein \npresented to address this issue, as they explicitly consider wave height as a third \nindependent variable (Figure 27 a) to c)).  \n\n   \n\na) 3D WTMH b) 3D WTMDir c) 3D WTMT \n\nFigure 27.

Methodological approach for wave propagation using the wave-by-wave (left panel) \nand the WTM (right panel) approaches.  \n\n \n\nThe WTM approach involves a two-step procedure: 1) building the WTM, and 2) \nwave transformation from deep-waters to nearshore through the use of this matrix \n(Figure 28). The first phase of building the WTM implies creating a matrix covering the \nrange of most likely, or relevant, periods and directions (Figure 28, 1B) (departing from \nthe deep-water wave time series (Figure 28, 1A)). In the case of a 3D WTM, the matrix \nalso covers the range of most likely values of deep-water wave height. Then, all possible \npairs of T0 and Dir0 (for 2D WTM) are computed to create a synthetic deep-water time \nseries with wave parameters (Figure 28, 1C). In the case of 3D WTM, triples \ncombinations also considered H0. A wave propagation model then runs for each \ncondition defined in the synthetic wave time series (Figure 28, 1D and Figure 29), creating \na synthetic nearshore wave time series (Figure 28, 1E) and allowing assembling the \nnearshore WTM (Figure 28, 1F) for height (WTMH), direction (WTMDir), and period \n(WTMT).  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 84 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 29. Procedure to build the WTMH from the wave propagation model results obtained at \nthe target location. The figure depicts an example for Dir0=330\u00ba and T0=12s. \n\nThe second phase implies wave transformation from deep-waters (Figure 28, 2A) to \nnearshore (Figure 28, 2C) by using the WTM (Figure 28, 2B). Wave transformation \nvalues are bilinearly interpolated from the WTM nodes. An example of a WTMH and its \nuse is presented in Figure 30.  \n\n \n\nFigure 30. Example of using a WTMH for two offshore wave conditions. The figure depicts an \nexercise that coastal managers, with no specific technical skills, can perform to convert two \nscenarios of wave conditions from deep-waters to nearshore.  \n\nFrom the above, it is clear that WTM approach is intrinsically more complex than the \nconventional wave-by-wave approach. However, the computational effort required to \ncompute calculation of a WTM is almost independent of the size of the deep-water time \nseries, whereas in the wave-by-wave approach computational effort is proportional to \nlength of the time series (Figure 31). In addition, despite building the WTM requires a \ncertain amount of time, which depends on the resolution of the WTM, this is a one-time \naction, and correspond to an effort done by scientists. Therefore, for coastal managers \nWTM can be considered as a ready-to-use solution.  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 85 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 31. Schematic relation between computational effort and number of waves for wave-by-\nwave and WTM approaches.

This phase-\naveraging (or spectral) wave model was designed to obtain realistic estimates of wave \nparameters in coastal areas and, as it is very flexible, it can be used in a wide range of \ncoastal applications at a wide range of spatial scales.  SWAN performs effectively and \nthat is why it was denoted as the \u201c\u2026community wave model\u201d (Rusu, 2011). Several \napplication of the SWAN model along the western coast of Portugal are described in the \nliterature, namely, in thesis, scientific papers and technical reports (e.g., Reis et al., 2013; \nRusu, 2011; Rusu et al., 2011; Neves et al., 2010; Silva, 2009; Capit\u00e3o et al., 2009).  \n\nThe SWAN model was forced along its open boundaries using wave time series \nparameters obtanied a 57-year hindcast (1953 to 2009) obtain by Dodet et al. (2010). Data \nare available at http://disepla.fc.ul.pt/Micore/WaveDownload.html. The model run in \nstationary mode, assuming that the JONSWAP spectrum adequately represented the \nspectrum of ocean waves in all simulations. It was also assumed that the energy \ndissipation due to bottom friction is adequately represented by the formulation proposed \nby Madsen et al. (1998, in SWAN Team, 2011) (friction coefficient equal to 0.05) and \nignoring the nonlinear wave-wave interactions (triads and quadruplets). A constant tide \nlevel equal to mean sea level was considered. The breaking coefficient followed SWAN \ndefault value of 0.78. The model ran in MATLAB\u00ae environment through the SwanAuto \ntoolbox developed by the Coastal Processes team of the Geology Department of the \nFaculty of Sciences of Lisbon University.  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 86 -  \n\nB a t h y m e t r i c  d a t a   \n\nThe bathymetric data used in the wave propagation model result from the compilation \nof different source of information (Figure 12). \n\n\u2022 Source 1: European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) (sea floor \ndomain not covered by source 2); \n\n\u2022 Source 2: Instituto Hidrogr\u00e1fico (IH);  \n\n\u2022 Source 3: Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Territ\u00f3rio (DGT) (with Light Detection And Ranging \n(LiDAR) data for the coastal zone domain). \n\nThis representation was complemented with Advanced Spaceborne Thermal \nEmission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (version \n2) data (source 4, land domain) developed jointly by the U.S. National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration and Japan\u2019s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 87 -  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 32.

Nevertheless, in the present work, the performance of WTM in \nsimulating wave propagation was validated by two methods: absolute performance by the \ncomparison of the simulated data with 1) field data (real system), and 2) relative \nperformance by the simulated data acquired through a wave-to-wave modeling strategy.  \n\nF i e l d  d a t a  \n\nValidation of wave parameters yielded by WTM was based on the comparison of HS, \nTp and Dir computed by the SWAN model, and data acquired by equipment\u2019s installed \noffshore in two different locations (Figure 32). \n\n\u2022 An acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP) deployed at 28 m depth offshore \nAlmagreira beach by the IH (data from 29 October 2009 to 11 October 2011) \navailable at Ribeiro (2013) (Point VAL1: location: X = -101002; Y = -29128 ETRS89 \nPT-TM06);  \n\n\u2022 The directional wave buoy moored at the depth of 30 m at the edge of the Tagus \nebb delta maintained by the Lisbon Port Authority (data between 31 July 2005 and 31 \nDecember 2008) (Point VAL2: location: X = -109094; Y = -115320 ETRS89 PT-\nTM06). \n\nBoundary conditions imposed to the model consisted of two wave time series of \nintegral parameters for the same location in the open sea (lat: 39.31\u00baN, long: 9.38\u00baW, \n2000 m depth) obtained from two different sources: \n\n\u2022 An oceanographic buoy installed by the IH under the MONItoring the Nazar\u00e9 \nCANyon (MONICAN) project; and, \n\n\u2022 Hindcast data provided by the National Data Buoy Center of the National Oceanic \nAnd Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that were interpolated to that location. \nThis procedure aim to test if the influence of different boundary conditions exceeds \nthe differences obtained using different wave transformation strategies (WTM vs. \nwave-by-wave).   \n\nIn the simulations, wave periods ranging from 5 to 21s and directions from 180\u00ba to \n360\u00ba, and different combinations of time- and direction-steps were tested (Table 5).

Nevertheless, it was found that very low resolutions WTM are, in general, \nrelated with the worst performances. As an example, RMSE for HS ranges from 0.28m \n(V2, V6 and V10) to 0.52m (V23), for Tp ranges from 1.60s (V13) to 2.06s (V4, V8 and \nV12), and for Dir ranges from 7.11\u00ba (V21) to 21.67\u00ba (V12).  \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 90 -  \n\nTable 7.

This can be explained \nbecause Paredes de Vit\u00f3ria is highly exposed to offshore waves. In addition, the \nlinear development of the beach and coast explains the similarity of all WTM for \nall simulations points.  \n\n\u2022 Nazar\u00e9 beach: an embayed beach at the head of the Nazar\u00e9 submarine canyon \n(Figure 37). The WTM yield different nearshore patterns along the same beach area \nand is evident that the northernmost simulate point (PNZ1) corresponds to the \nmost sheltered beach ribbon. This result is in agreement with those obtained by \nSilveira et al. (2016). \n\n\u2022 Tamariz beach: lowest Hsmean of all the simulated points (Figure 38).

They are also are very helpful in providing visualization of the changes \nexperimented by waves when propagating in progressively shallow water towards a \nspecific coastal location.  \n\n5 . 3 . 2 . 6  S e t t i n g  a n  a g e n d a  f o r  f u t u r e  r e s e a r c h   \n\nThe availability of reliable data concerning the nearshore wave regime is fundamental \nin coastal zone planning and management. Numerical models of waves propagation are \nable to produce hindcast and forecast products describing waves parameters. They can \nmake available in a useful time scales the oceanographic data necessary to support \ndecision-making process.  \n\nIn this context, WTM revealed to be an excellent approach to deliver nearshore wave \ndata. Results obtained allow concluding that 1) 2D WTM have a very good performance \nin the characterization of nearshore wave regime providing good results in a simpler and \nfaster manner, 2) 3D WTMH should be used in target-areas where wave breaking or \nwhere bottom friction leads to significant energy dissipation seaward of the simulation \npoint and 3) 2D WTMT should be used under circumstances where the wave period is \nlikely to change, such as sheltered coastal stretches or areas with strong refraction. The \nfindings herein presented also allowed to conclude that the WTM 1) imply significantly \nsmaller computational and interpretation effort and time, in comparison with a \nconventional wave-by-wave modeling strategy, and 2) are very helpful in the visualization \nof the physical processes related with waves propagation.  \n\nIn this sense, WTM offer a high potential as a management-tool as their adoption \nallows for coastal managers (and other users) to simulate wave conditions for specific \ntarget-area in a simple and intuitive manner. An offshore wave forecast with an adequate \nWTM allows predicting wave conditions or interpret the wave regime at a certain beach, \nby any WTM-user, as no specific technical skills are required. Moreover, WTM allow \nusers to acknowledge the wave transformation processes and inform on uncertainty \ninvolved in processing wave data from the deep-waters to nearshore.  \n\nFuture works should consider optimizing the potential of WTM by investing in the \ndevelopment of friendlier user-interfaces. As WTM approach implies smaller \ncomputational time (in comparison with a conventional wave-by-wave modeling strategy) \nit makes WTM approach suitable for the development of website and smartphone \napplications. These developments can set the agenda for future research (Figure 39).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 100 -  \n\n \n\nFigure 39. \u201cWave Transformation Matrices\u201d: project\u2019s audience, language, channel of \ncommunication and mechanism adopted to get the message across and reach the audience. \n\n5.3.3 Conclusions \n\nManagement-oriented tools aim to turn science-based data into helpful information \ndirectly useful to policy-makers and managers. They constitute a major opportunity to \nfoster scientific knowledge integration in decision-making, acting as catalyzers in the \nscience-management interface. In fact, some of these tools can even be useful to other \ncoastal actors. In agreement with this, the tool presented in this sub-chapter, WTM, \nbesides being useful for coastal managers, are also suitable to address the needs of \ninformation of sub-groups of society with varied interests in the coastal zone (e.g., \nsurfers, fishermen). Management-oriented tools may also have a role in allowing users to \nbe informed on physical processes acting upon the coast and acknowledge uncertainty. \nThe latter issue is of major importance in foster engagement among coastal actors as it is \ngrounded in the principle of the \u201cbest available knowledge\u201d, where scientists assume the \nexistence of changes and limitations in scientific knowledge and understanding. \n\nChapter 5.3 |Key messages \n\nv? Management-oriented tools are designed to support the generation of specific \ninformation directly useful to policy-makers and managers: more than providing access to \ncoastal data, management-oriented aim to turn data into helpful information. \n\nv? WTM are management-oriented tools that allow computing reliable and timely \ninformation concerning the nearshore wave regime or particular state of the sea. This \ninformation is of vital importance in coastal zone management.  \n\nv? WTM allow users to acknowledge physical processes upstreaming their understanding on \nthe coastal system and of uncertainty. The latter issue, combined with the principle of the \n\u201cbest available knowledge\u201d, is of major importance in building engagement among coastal \nactors.  \n\nv? Future work such consider to optimize the potential of WTM by the development of \nfriendlier user-interfaces: website or smartphone applications can set the agenda for \nfuture research.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 101 -  \n\n5.4 Co-production \n\nCo-production emerged in social sciences in the 1970\u2019s. The idea was first articulated \nby Elinor Ostrom (2009 Nobel prize winner for economics) (Boyle and Michael, 2009) \nwho, in 1996 (Ostrom, 1996), defined co-production as a \u201c\u2026process through which \ninputs from individuals who are not in the same organization are transformed into goods \nand services\u201d. The concept has been evolving and, in 2011, Armitage et al. have \n(re)defined co-production \u201cas the collaborative process among [coastal] actors bringing a \nplurality of knowledge types together to address a specific problem, aiming at building an \nintegrated solution for that problem\u201d.  \n\nIn the scope of the present study, co-production is represented by the \u201cCIS - Coastal \nInformation System for the municipality of Cascais\u201d project, co-designed in close \ncollaboration with technicians from this municipality aiming the establishment of a \ncoastal monitoring program targeting Cascais\u2019 beaches.  \n\n5.4.1 The concept \n\nCo-production is often described as a process where people \u201ccontribute to\u201d and \n\u201ccollaborate in\u201d the generation of the outputs. Despite the lack of agreement of a \n\u201cuniversal\u201d definition (Boyle and Harris, 2009) five core elements of co-production can \nbe identified according to Heaton et al. (2016): (1) all participants are regarded as active \nparties and not merely passive subjects or recipients of outputs; (2) there is greater \nequality in the relations between co-production participants, with outputs becoming \nmore user-driven, and users\u2019 knowledge and experience being valued on an equal basis; \n(3) working together allows for achieving more (and better) outcomes than working \napart; (4) continued participation of parties involved transforms the ways in which \noutputs are designed and delivered; this helps in  developing the capacity for users\u2019 to \nidentify and present their needs of information; and (5) participation in co-production \nshould be encouraged and facilitated by networks and organizations that support their \ninvolvement - nevertheless, it is recognized that it is people, not systems, who create \nchange (Heaton et al., 2016). \n\nFrom the above, it is possible to conclude that co-production contains intrinsic \nbenefits for those involved, creating the possibility for coastal actors to share their \nknowledge and motivations and to shape consensual or best-compromise solutions \naround their needs. LARCI (2010) stated that co-production fosters mutual trust and \ncommunication, generates reciprocal and mutual benefits, and alters attitudes.  In recent \nyears, co-production has also been linked to describe the growing engagement of policy-\nmakers and managers in driven research motivated to solve societal problems (Martin, \n2010; Nutley, 2010). \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 102 -  \n\n5.4.2 \u201cCoastal Information System for the municipality of Cascais\u201d project \n\nThe \u201cCoastal Information System for the municipality of Cascais\u201d project (designated \nby CIS project from this point forward) emerged with the objective of designing a \nroadmap towards the implementation of a coastal monitoring program targeting the \nbeaches of Cascais. This program addresses specific needs of the managers of this \nmunicipality, based upon de implementation of an indicator-based coastal monitoring \nprogram.  \n\nThe trigger for this collaboration was the positive experience and high levels of \nengagement achieved under the framework of the outreach initiative \u201cThe Beaches of \nCascais: past and present\u201d (see chapter 5.1.2. The Beaches of Cascais: past and present).   \n\n5 . 4 . 2 . 1  M o t i v a t i o n  \n\nThe coastal zone of Cascais is characterized by beaches, cliffs and sand dunes that \nplay an important role as environmental, economical and social values of this \nmunicipality. Beaches, in particular, are a major asset of Cascais and a key driver of local \neconomy. Acknowledging their importance, the municipality of Cascais aims to establish \na monitoring program to raise the present-day level of understanding of beaches change \nand evolution at seasonal to long-term time scales. Beside the data and science involved \nthe program also aims to support the definition of measures aiming at beach \nconservation. Actually, projects of beach changes under scenarios of climate change and \nsea level rise indicate that a significant reduction in the beach area of all Cascais beaches \nis expectable if no conservation actions are taken (Taborda and Ribeiro, 2015). \nFurthermore, it is an ambition of those who participate in the design of the CIS project \nto foster communication of results of the monitoring program in a systematic manner. \nThe goal is to make the CIS project a linkage initiative amongst the different coastal \nactors contributing to raise their engagement in coastal issues.  \n\n5 . 4 . 2 . 2  A p p r o a c h  \n\nTo support the development of a monitoring program targeting Cascais coastline, the \n\u201cFrame of Reference\u201d approach was adopted aiming to structure the interaction of \nscientists, and policy-makers and coastal managers in application-oriented knowledge \ndevelopment according to van Koningsveld (2003). Within this approach, the starting \npoint for knowledge development is to get the big picture of the information and \nknowledge needed by policy-makers and coastal managers. In addition, a key element is \nthe definition of \u201cfit-for-purpose\u201d indicators.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 103 -  \n\nAccording to van Koningsveld (2003) the \u201cFrame of Reference\u201d is potentially useful \nin any situation where miscommunication arises in interaction between interdependent \ncoastal actors, with different states of knowledge, working on different parts of the same \noverall problem.  \n\n\u201cFrame of Reference\u201d is represented in Figure 40 and involves the six key-steps: \n\n\u2022 Strategic objective: that expresses the long-term management vision and policy;  \n\n\u2022 Operational objective(s): that describes how the strategic objective will be achieved in a \nfour stage process:  \n\n\u2022 Quantitative state concept: a means of quantifying the problem in hand. The \napplication of indicators is relevant at this stage of the process; \n\n\u2022 Benchmarking process: a means of assessing whether or not action is required. At this \nstage indicators are compared to threshold values; \n\n\u2022 Intervention procedure: defines in detail what action is required if the benchmark \nvalues are exceeded; \n\n\u2022 Evaluation procedure: assesses the impact of the action taken. If the action has not \nbeen successful it may be necessary to revise the strategic/operational objectives \nand hence the feedback loops indicated in Figure 40. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 40. The \u201cFrame of Reference\u201d postulated by van Koningsveld (2003). \n\nThe \u201cFrame of Reference\u201d has been previously applied under the scope of a \nPortuguese project Consultoria para a Cria\u00e7\u00e3o e Implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de um Sistema de Monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o do \nLitoral abrangido pela \u00e1rea de jurisdi\u00e7\u00e3o da ARH do Tejo (Carapu\u00e7o et al., 2013c) as well as in \nseveral European projects, namely, CoastView (Davidson et al., 2007; van Koningsveld et \nal., 2007), Conscience (Marchand, 2010) and Morphological Impacts and COastal Risks \ninduced by Extreme storm events (Micore) (Ciavola et al., 2011). \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 104 -  \n\nIn the framework of the CIS project, the strategic objective for Cascais municipality was \nidentified as sustainability (in a broad sense), from which coastal sustainability and \nsustainable tourism arise as main concerns. The priority operational objective is the definition \nof beaches width accounting for variations at short- (tide level), medium- (seasonality) \nand long-term (sea-level rise) time scales. This objective was triggered by the need to \nestablish management strategies attending to two particular situations: 1) minimizing \nconflict, during bathing season, between beach users and concessionaires due to \ncompeting interests in the use of the (available) beach area; 2) assessing the impact of sea \nlevel rise and the predicted reduction in beach area (Taborda and Ribeiro, 2015; PECAC, \n2010). The coastal geoindicator selected as most relevant support quantitative state concept \nwas identified as beach width, which implicitly implies the determination of other two \ngeoindicators: coastline and shoreline positions (see Table 3 in Chapter 4. Coastal indicators: \na common language).  \n\nAs suggested in the literature (van Rijin, 2010; van Koningsveld, 2003), and within the \nspirit of co-production, selection of the indicator \u201cbeach width\u201d reflects the input from \nboth coastal managers and scientists. The importance of their involvement is that the \nformer are able to assess what information will be of most value to the management, \nwhile the latter can determine what and when might be possible to measure based on \nexisting or potential data and technology and how the scientific understanding of the data \nset may contribute to fulfill management or conservation needs. Indicators assume the \nrole of the \u201ccommon\u201d language (see Chapter 4. Coastal indicators: a common language) \nbetween the different parties as they are comprehensible to all parties involved while, \nsimultaneously, assure rigorous reporting (Figure 41). \n\n \n\nFigure 41. \u201cCIS \u2013 Coastal Information System\u201d: project\u2019s audience and language, channel of \ncommunication and mechanism adopted to get the message across and reach the audience. \n\nCIS project will also allow identifying the best methodologies to monitor the changes \nin the width of the beaches of Cascais. Results from the project \u201cCascais Beach Photo \nMonitoring\u201d (see 5.2.2. \u201cCascais Beach Photo Monitoring\u201d project) will be a contribution in \nthis direction by investigating the value of systematic acquisition of photographs to \ncharacterize the changes in the area of the beaches of Cascais. Implementation of CIS \nproject will further allow the establishment of the following steps of the \u201cFrame of \nReference\u201d contributing to the establishment of threshold values to support the \ndefinition of coastal interventions, and the assessment of the impact of those \ninterventions.  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 105 -  \n\nAt present time, Cascais municipality conducts small-scale and localized sand shifting \noperations amongst beaches aiming at solving problems related with the variations of \nbeach width during beach session. However, these operations are performed on an ad hoc \nbasis and do not benefit from scientific understanding of the sedimentary budget.  \n\n5 . 4 . 2 . 3  R o a d m a p  o f  t h e  C I S  p r o j e c t  \n\nThe roadmap presented in Figure 42 aims to provide a chronological overview of the \nfour key-activities of the CIS project: \n\nDesign of the monitoring program: includes the establishment of key-areas (i.e., beaches of \nCascais) and key-issues (i.e., variations in beaches width) according to the needs of \ninformation of managers from Cascais municipality. Still to be solved the most efficient \ntechniques for data acquisition (e.g., photo and video monitoring, cross-shore profile and \ntopographic surveys) and data processing with may not be the same in all beaches. This \nstep considers the evaluation of the resources available in Cascais municipality namely in \nterms of human resources, equipment and existing data sets, namely those available at \nGeo Cascais platform as well as the development of crowdsourcing initiatives. The goal \nis to optimize resources and increases [chances of] the longevity of the monitoring \nprogram.  Crowdsourcing have the additional benefit of upstream society engagement in \ncoastal issues.  \n\nImplementation of the monitoring program and skill development: includes putting into \noperation the routines for data acquisition, processing and making data and information \navailable to all key coastal actors as well as training of technicians of the municipality of \nCascais \n\nCommunication plan: includes the presentation of the project and its results to different \naudiences, by the development of outreach activities and \u201cget-together\u201d initiatives \n(workshops, conferences seminars). In addition to crowdsourcing, the implementation of \nthe communication plan will further promote society engagement in coastal issues. \n\n \n\nFigure 42. Roadmap towards the implementation of the CIS project. \n\nLike other stages of the CIS project, this roadmap was co-produced with managers, \ntechnics and staff from Cascais Municipality.  This option can make the difference in \nshifting the balance of responsibilities and resources, transforming the dynamics between \nparticipants and shortening the leap to the implementation of the CIS project.  \n\n\n\nMechanisms to transfer scientific knowledge: from concept to implementation \n\n - 106 -  \n\n5.4.3 Conclusions  \n\nCo-production is a collaborative process among [coastal] actors that take place in \n\u201cmiddle ground\u201d. Co-production bridges a plurality of knowledge types together to \naddress a specific problem and makes the solution for that problem to be more efficient, \nmore effective and more responsive to the needs of coastal actors. The CSI project was \ndesigned using a co-production approach involving scientists and managers and \ntechnicians from Cascais municipality with the objective of establishing a roadmap \ntowards the implementation of a coastal monitoring program targeting the beaches of \nthis municipality. Despite the design of the project having been more time-consuming \nthat under typical circumstances (i.e., when projects are designed [almost] exclusively by \nscientists), the output is much more likely to address the managers\u2019 needs of information, \nto optimizing resources and to involve the non-scientists communities. This can \nincreases the changes of implementation and success of the CIS project. It is worth to \nmention that the positive experience of the outreach initiative \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: \npast and present\u201d (see chapter 5.1.2. The Beaches of Cascais: past and present) enabled the \nconditions that facilitated the adoption of a co-production strategy for the CIS project. \nThis highlights the importance of outreach in building higher levels of engagement \namong coastal actors, namely in enabling conditions for co-production. \n\nChapter 5.4 | Key messages \n\nv?

This highlights the \nimportance of outreach in enabling conditions for fostering collaboration requiring higher \nlevels of engagement.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIMPROVING THE TRANSFER OF COASTAL \nSCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE: FROM CONCEPT TO \n\nIMPLEMENTATION \n \n\n \n\nChapter 6 \n\nA conceptual model for successful knowledge \ntransfer \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n - 108 -  \n\nChapter 6 \n\n6. A conceptual model for successful \nknowledge transfer \n\n[This subchapter is based on: Carapu\u00e7o, M.M., Taborda, R., Andrade, C., de Jonge, V.N. 2016a. Coping with coastal \nchange: from scientific knowledge to implementation (Submitted)] \n\nIt is widely acknowledged that to promote the integration of science in the decision-\nmaking process \u201ca one size fits all\u201d approach will not work (Bonne et al., 2014). In this \nwork, four mechanisms for transferring scientific knowledge were identified: outreach, \ncrowdsourcing, management-oriented tools and co-production. The selection of the \nmore adequate mechanism will depend both on audience\u2019s engagement and aspired \nfeedback. The conceptual model depicted in Figure 43 aims to guide scientists in this \nselection.  \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 43. A conceptual model to guide scientists (on the left) in the selection of the best \nmechanism to transfer scientific knowledge to other key coastal actors (on the right). Four \nmechanisms for transferring scientific knowledge can be adopted: co-production, management-\noriented tools, crowdsourcing and outreach. Each mechanism requires a different effort in \nframing by scientists, and its adoption is constrained by the level of engagement of the audience. \nThis conceptual model highlights that in order to adopt higher-level mechanisms (e.g., co-\nproduction) it is necessary to assure high levels of engagement; when these conditions are not \nmet is necessary to previously implement lower-level mechanisms, fostering engagement. \n\n \n\n\n\nA conceptual model for success knowledge transfer \n\n - 109 -  \n\nCommunication is only effective if both scientific and non-scientific actors are willing \nto converge and take the necessary steps to meet at some point of the communication \nprocess, which is conceptualized by the \u201cmeeting line\u201d depicted in Figure 43 by the solid \noblique line. This bridging effort can be approached from both sides in a proportion that \nwill depend on the mechanism adopted (depicted in Figure 43 by the horizontal lines: \neffort in framing by scientists, and level of engagement by non-scientists). When the \ncommunication process is successful it not only increases receivers\u2019 scientific \nunderstanding on the coastal system but also fosters engagement and generates feedback. \nThe quality and amount of feedback depends on the adopted mechanism with a \ncomplexity that increases from awareness (in response to outreach) to knowledge (in \nresponse to co-production). This conceptual model shows that, in order to adopt higher-\nlevel mechanisms (such as co-production for scientific knowledge transfer), it is \nnecessary to assure high levels of engagement. If these conditions are not meet it is \nnecessary to previously implement actions requiring lower level mechanisms (such as \noutreach), to foster engagement. \n\n \n\n\u2022 When the objective of scientists is to raise awareness of an audience that is scarcely \nengaged into coastal science, outreach arises as the most adequate mechanism for \nscientific knowledge transfer (bottom of Figure 43). As the audience may not be tuned \nto scientific language and contents, outreach is the mechanism involving the highest \nframing effort by scientists. The feedback of a well-succeeded outreach initiative is \nraising awareness on coastal issues, thus contributing to trigger involvement of the \naudience. In addition, this helps to change receivers\u2019 attitude from passive to active, \nincreasing their level of engagement. When society is engaged with science, it is no \nlonger a mere spectator of coastal policies and development and is more capable and \nwilling to influence the policy-makers and managers towards coastal sustainability, and \nalso willing to offer useful contributions to coastal science and management.  \n\n\u2022 In crowdsourcing the audience plays an active role, thus the adoption of this \nmechanism requires some level of engagement. This mechanism has the advantage of \ncontributing to the development of a participatory society, which is an important step \ntowards coastal sustainability. Furthermore, the data generated by the use of this \nmechanism also create a positive feedback to the knowledge generation process. \n\n\u2022 In management-oriented tools, it is expected that coastal actors become more \nautonomous in generating information according to their specific needs. This \nmechanism needs lower framing effort because coastal actors involved are, in general, \nmore engaged and aware of the challenges of coastal sustainability. Information \ngenerated by using management-oriented tools also increases in relevance (as it refers to \ncontextualized data) helping scientists to further understand the coastal system.  \n\n \n\n\n\nA conceptual model for success knowledge transfer \n\n - 110 -  \n\n\u2022 Co-production can be regarded as highest-level mechanism in scientific knowledge \ntransfer as the audience is closer to scientific language and issues, thus involving the \nlowest framing effort by scientists (top of the Figure 43). The adoption of this \nmechanism benefits from the knowledge (i.e., combined information leading to \nunderstanding) generated (also) by the audience. This mechanism stimulates the \nintegration of different types of knowledge, thus promoting optimal conditions for \nimplementation. \n\nThe conceptual model for scientific knowledge transfer aims to contribute towards a \nsociety where all key coastal actors are active asset-holders. The mechanisms portrayed in \nthis model can be linked with their typical audiences and expected feedbacks: the lower-\nlevel mechanisms usually target society, and the higher-level mechanisms target policy-\nmakers and managers. Notwithstanding, they can be used to reach all types of audiences \nwith a success that mainly depends on the initial levels of engagement of the different \nparties.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIMPROVING THE TRANSFER OF COASTAL \nSCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE: FROM CONCEPT TO \n\nIMPLEMENTATION \n \n\n \n\nChapter 7 \n\nConclusions and outlook \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n - 112 -  \n\nChapter 7 \n\n7. Conclusions and outlook \nAchieving coastal sustainability depends on the effective integration of scientific \n\nknowledge in the decision-making process. To do so, scientists need to be able to \ntransfer their knowledge outside of the scientific community. However, communication \ngaps arise as a major obstacle to scientific knowledge integration. Communication \nbarriers include differences in language adopted by different groups of coastal actors (e.g., \nscientific vs. non-scientific language) and the channels of communication selected by the \nscientific community (e.g., scientific articles) that do not account for specificities of non-\nscientific audiences. In overcoming these drawbacks, scientists need to acknowledge that \ntheir role does not end when scientific knowledge is developed. Scientists have also an \nindispensable role in its successful delivery to non-scientists. \n\nIn the development of a scientific knowledge-transferring framework, the \nidentification of the coastal actors is of paramount importance. Coastal actors (other \nrather scientists themselves) make the audiences that scientists aim to reach and \nunderstanding and respecting their specificities is vital to make communication \nsuccessful. Besides scientists, two other key coastal actors were identified and considered \nin this work: policy-makers and managers, and society. It was also found that \nunderstanding the ways coastal actors interact is a major issue in fostering knowledge \ntransfer, as the existence of weak bounds, or even disconnection, among coastal actors \ncan seriously prejudice knowledge transfer among them. This was put in evidence in the \nCoastal Knowledge Triangle, a model that conceptualize coastal actors, their roles and links.  \n\nOnce the audience is clearly identified, knowledge transfer depends on coastal actors\u2019 \nengagement and adequate framing of the message to be delivered by scientists. \nEngagement is grounded on empathy and, beyond simple awareness of the problem it \nimplies action in itself, enabled by coastal actors\u2019 willingness, trust, competence and \ncommitment. Framing helps turning scientific data into meaningful information for the \ntarget audience. Framing involves translating scientific findings into an understandable \nlanguage by different audiences as well as choosing the proper channels of \ncommunication to convey the message.  \n\nIndicators arise as the most efficient \u201ccommon language\u201d to communicate science. \nMoreover, proven to be useful to describe the state and trends of evolution of the coastal \nzone. However, a standardized concept and approach on coastal indicators\u2019 \nquantification and reporting was lacking. Therefore, in the scope of the present study, a \ncommon framework for the establishment of coastal geoindicators for sandy coast \nenvironments was developed. Sixteen indicators were identified as relevant for beach, \ncoastal dune and coastal barrier environments. \n\n\n\nConclusions and outlook \n\n - 113 -  \n\nNevertheless, to effectively communicate science it is necessary to find means to \nrelate with the audience in order to get the message across. In this work four mechanisms \nfor knowledge transfer were identified based upon real world applications. In addition, a \nconceptual model was developed to guide scientists in the selection of the most adequate \nmechanism. Outreach is the most widely known and adopted mechanism to transfer \nscientific knowledge. However, other means are available: crowdsourcing, managers-\noriented tools and co-production. With the exception of outreach these mechanisms are \nstill in early stages of development and experimentation \u2013 but they all are promising \nalternatives and should be considered as major opportunities to foster knowledge \ntransfer. Each mechanism accounts for the audience specificities and conveys the \nmessage in a different way leading to different types of feedback from the audience: \noutreach leads to coastal awareness; crowdsourcing to data generation; management-\noriented tools generate information, and co-production generates knowledge. Moreover, \nand if adequately used, these mechanisms can foster engagement, minimize framing \neffort and optimize audiences\u2019 feedback.  \n\nIn the scope of the present study the concepts of each mechanism are presented and \ndiscussed as well as the results obtained by real-world applications are put-forward. Two \noutreach initiatives were developed aiming at increasing literacy and awareness: \u201cThe \nBeaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d and \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for learning\u201d. \nBoth case studies were highly successful outreach initiatives: \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: \npast and present\u201d exhibition was successful in raising public understanding about the \ncoastal system, and promoting a shift in people\u2019 beliefs about beach evolution trends. \nThe project \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave: a trigger for learning\u201d was designed with the purpose of \ntransferring scientific knowledge about the physics of waves using the Nazar\u00e9 Wave as \nthe trigger.  The principal outcome of this project - the \u201cThe Nazar\u00e9 Wave\u201d movie - had \nover 6.000 views in the first month of its release and, three months later had been viewed \nin more than 95 countries. Results\u2019 allowed concluding that outreach is a major \nopportunity in fostering engagement and in developing a knowledge-based society.  \n\nIn relation with crowdsourcing, in which society can participate in scientific research \nby providing more data, the \u201cCascais Beach Photo Monitoring\u201d project was design and \nthe first task of the project, which implies a 1-year systematic acquisition of photographs \ntargeting the beaches of Cascais, was implemented. This project aims to be a proof of \nconcept approach designed to demonstrate feasibility of systematic acquisition of \nphotographs to support further developments of crowdsourcing tools targeting beach \nmonitoring. It was found that photographs are a valuable resource in beach monitoring \nas they easily provide a reliable qualitative identification of beach changes while, at the \nsame time, can have a major positive impact in upstreaming public engagement on \ncoastal issues. Moreover, results suggest that crowdsourcing can not only increase the \nfrequency of observations, in ways that coastal management agencies may not be able to \ndo, but also contribute to reducing costs associated with coastal monitoring programs.   \n\n\n\nConclusions and outlook \n\n - 114 -  \n\nWithin management-oriented tools, it was developed the \u201cWave Transformation \nMatrices\u201d, a graphical solution that allows for estimating site-specific nearshore wave \ncharacteristics. Besides being demonstrated to be useful for coastal managers, WTM can \nalso be suitable to address the needs of information of sub-groups of society (e.g., \nsurfers, fishermen). In addition, WTM allows users to be informing on physical processes \nand acknowledge uncertainty and issue is of major importance in building trust among \ncoastal actors, grounded in the principle of the \u201cbest available knowledge\u201d.  \n\nThe \u201cCoastal Information System for the municipality of Cascais\u201d (CIS) project, \naiming at establishing of a coastal monitoring program targeting Cascais\u2019 beaches, was \nco-design in close collaboration with technicians from this municipality. CIS project \nconstitutes a successful example of co-production having benefits in address the needs of \nthose who participated and in maximizing resources, thus increasing the changes of \nprojects\u2019 implementation and longevity. Worth mention that the conditions for the \ndevelopment of the CIS project was base upon previous (positive) experience from the \noutreach initiative \u201cThe Beaches of Cascais: past and present\u201d. This highlights the \nimportance of outreach in fostering engagement and in enabling conditions for moving \nforward closer collaboration.  \n\nResults from the above-mentioned projects allowed for the development and \nestablishment of a conceptual model aiming at supporting scientists in the selection of \nthe most adequate mechanisms for successful knowledge transfer. In this selection \nscientists must weigh the expected level of engagement of the audience, and expected \nfeedback in both quantity and quality aspects. Using the adequate mechanism will help in \novercoming the existent communication gaps and increase the participation of all key \ncoastal actors in the decision-making process.  \n\nScientists must also develop their framing skills and acknowledging the benefits of \nengaging with others. In addition, scientists need to (and sometimes, learn to) listen to \ntheir audience to find and understand their needs of information. Such an attitude will \nallow scientists and science to effectively inform decision-making as often society\u2019s (in a \nbroad scope) needs of information differs from that which science routinely provides. \nThis effort is time-consuming and challenges scientists to step outside their comfort zone \nand to take the necessary steps to reach non-scientists in their own ground. Whenever \nscientists are able and willing to make these additional efforts and to communicate more \neffectively with non-scientist audiences, the end-products extend beyond informed \ndecision-making: it is now becoming widely acknowledged that when this interaction is \neffective science thrives. Furthermore, science is increasingly interdisciplinary and the \nability to communicate more effectively across disciplines (e.g., natural and social \nsciences) fosters scientists and institutions\u2019 collaboration, which certainly leads to better \napproaches and solutions towards sustainability.  \n\n \n\n\n\nConclusions and outlook \n\n - 115 -  \n\nThe results obtained in the scope of this work and the conclusions herein presented \nallow putting forward a number of tangible considerations aiming at promoting and \ndeveloping a culture of science communication in universities and research &amp; \ndevelopment (R&amp;D) institutions. This will narrow the communication gaps between \nscientists (and science) and other coastal actors and will improve the effectiveness of \ncoastal scientific knowledge transfer: \n\n\u2022 The establishment of science communication offices at universities and R&amp;D \ninstitutions as an interface between institutions that generate scientific knowledge and \nthe outside world.  \n\n\u2022 To assure science communication projects and initiatives into institutional planning \nand resources allocation enabling conditions for the design and implementation of \noutreach initiatives. \n\n\u2022 To assure training in science communication for faculty, staff and students. Their \ninvolvement in science communication activities should be recognized, valued and \nrewarded. \n\nAs transferring scientific knowledge implies the existence of target-audiences, it is also \nimportant that governmental, regional and municipal institutions sharing responsibilities \nin science policies and in the management of the coastal zone develop their own \nresources to maximize the process of knowledge transfer.  \n\nThis study relies on the premise that a knowledge-based society is needed to meet the \nobjective of coastal sustainability. Therefore, scientists should actively pursue the goal of \ntransferring science outside of the scientific community and fully embrace their role in \nthis process. The implementation of the above-mentioned measures will contribute to \nimprove the transfer of coastal scientific knowledge, from concept to implementation. \nAltogether, scientists and institutional efforts will shorten the leap from knowledge to \nimplementation fostering the use of scientific knowledge as the rationale for costal \nsustainability.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n \n\n - 117 -  \n\nReferences \nAgardy, T., Alder, J., Dayton, P., Curran, S., Kitchingman, A., Wilson, M., Catenazzi,  A., \n\nRestrepo, J., Birkeland, C., Blaber, S., Saifullah, S., Branch, G., Boersma, D., Nixon, S.,.
