Morphology and chemical composition of polymetallic \n\nnodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone, the Indian Ocean and Rio Grande \n\nRise, a comparative study. 2017. 94 p. Dissertation (Master) \u2013 Oceanographic \n\nInstitute, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, 2017. \n\nDeep sea polymetallic nodules are concretions of manganese and iron oxides \n\nformed around a nucleus. They accrete either hydrogenetically \u2013 metals precipitate \n\nfrom the seawater \u2013 or diagenetically \u2013 metals precipitate from the sediment pore \n\nwater. The accretion process affects both the nodules morphology and geochemistry. \n\nIn this study, fourteen polymetallic nodules from four ocean regions, namely the \n\nClarion-Clippertone Zone (Northeast Pacific Ocean), the Central Indian Basin \n\n(Central Indian Ocean), the Mascarene Basin (West Indian Ocean), and the Rio \n\nGrande Rise (Southwest Atlantic Ocean), were used to compare morphological and \n\ngeochemical aspects between the different oceanic regions. Computed Tomography \n\n(CT) was applied to study the nodules internal structure. Scanning Electron \n\nMicroscopy (SEM) was used to describe the micro layers within the nodules. \n\nChemical composition of growth layers and nuclei was determined by both Micro X-\n\nray Fluoscence (?-XRF) and Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass \n\nSpectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS). Finally, X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy \n\n(XANES) was performed in order to determine the speciation (i.e., the oxidation \n\nstate) of Mn and Fe. Polymetallic nodules from the Central Indian Basin are \n\ndiagenetic and the ones from the Mascarene Basin and the Rio Grande Rise are \n\nhydrogenetic, while nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone are of mixed type. \n\nHowever, the dominant accretion process varies across the nodules resulting in \n\ninhomogeneous layer textures and chemical composition. Strong Mn and Fe \n\nfractionation occurs in the diagenetic and mixed type nodules accompanied by \n\nfractionation of the trace elements Ni, Cu, Co and Ti. Mn and Fe are present in the \n\nnodules mainly as oxidized species Mn\n4+\n\n and Fe\n3+\n\n, independently of the degree of \n\nfractionation. Schematic models of the nodules environment of formation are \n\nproposed, in which and the fractionation of Mn and Fe is possibly the result of the \n\nvariation of the redox front depth through time. \n\nKey-words: Polymetallic nodules; Morphology; Geochemistry; Genesis of \n\nnodules. \n\n\n\n \n \n\nFIGURES \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Formation environments of polymetallic nodules, from hard rock at \n\nseamounts to porous sediment at deep ocean basins.

INTRODUCTION \n\nMarine polymetallic nodules, also known as manganese nodules or \n\nferromanganese nodules, are mineral concretions of manganese and iron oxides that form \n\nupon the seafloor about a nucleus at a rate of the order of 1 mm per 10\n4\n to 10\n\n6\n years \n\n(CRONAN, 1977; HEIN; KOSCHINSKY, 2014). Because of this extremely low growth rate, \n\npolymetallic nodules absorb high quantity of rare earth elements and trace elements of \n\nrelevant economic interest (CRONAN, 1978; GLASBY, 2002; HEIN et al., 2013; HEIN; \n\nPETERSEN, 2013). Together with the marine cobalt-rich crusts, the nodules compose the \n\nso-called marine ferromanganese deposits (HEIN and KOCHICNKY 2014).  \n\nDeep sea polymetallic nodules were early reported by Murray and Irvine (1895), \n\nwho described the first nodules dredged from the seafloor in the Pacific during the \n\nChallenger Deep Sea Exploring Expedition (1872-1876). Since then, the marine \n\npolymetallic nodules deposits passed to be more systematically studied only in the 70s \n\nand 80s, when a more in deep scientific investigation, driven by economic interests, \n\naddressed the question on how they are formed (CRONAN; TOOMS, 1969; BONATTI; \n\nKRAEMER; RYDELL, 1972; GLASBY, 1977; CRONAN, 1978; BATURIN, 1988).  \n\nAlthough the polymetallic nodules have been reported from a variety of marine \n\nenvironments, namely abyssal plains, seamounts, plateaus, mid-ocean ridges and \n\ncontinental margins (CRONAN, 1977), they are more concentrated in deep ocean basins. \n\nThe largest polymetallic nodules fields known to date are located in the Pacific abyssal \n\nplains (up to 5000 m depth) of the Clarion-Clippertone Zone (CCZ), in the Peru Basin (PB) \n\nand in the Central Indian Basin (CIB). The CCZ hosts the largest and more extensively \n\nstudied deposit, where nodules density is about 15 kg per m\n2\n and reaches 75 kg per m\n\n2\n in \n\nsome areas (HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013).   \n\nPolymetallic nodules are more concentrated in abyssal plains where the  \n\nsedimentation rate is low, of the order of a few mm per 10\n3\n years (GLASBY, 2006). Where \n\nsedimentation is inhibited by bottom currents, oxygenation at the sea floor is constant, \n\nwhich promotes oxidation of Mn and Fe (PUTEANUS; HALBACH, 1988; HEIN; \n\nPETERSEN, 2013). Deep ocean basins are mostly washed by deep water masses \n\nenriched in dissolved oxygen, for example the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) bathing the \n\nnodules deposits in the Pacific Ocean (GLASBY, 2006), in the Indian Ocean (VINEESH et \n\nal., 2009) and in the Atlantic Ocean (KASTEN et al., 1998).  \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nThe main mechanisms of nodules growth are hydrogenetic accretion and diagenetic \n\naccretion of Mn and Fe layers, well described by many authors (GLASBY, 1977; \n\nHALBACH; MARCHIG; SCHERHAG, 1980; HALBACH et al., 1981; DYMOND et al., 1984; \n\nHALBACH, 1986; BATURIN, 1988; HEIN et al., 1997). The prevailing growth mechanism \n\nis linked to the environment of formation. \n\nHydrogenetic accretion occurs by oxidation and precipitation of colloidal metals from \n\nseawater at a rate of 1 to 10 mm Myr\n-1\n\n (HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013). On the other hand, \n\ndiagenetic growth occurs by oxidation and precipitation of metals from sediment pore \n\nwater, which became remobilized due to the decay of sedimentary organic matter. \n\nDiagenetic accretion takes place at rates of the order of 100 mm Myr\n-1\n\n or more (DYMOND \n\net al., 1984; HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013). During hydrogenetic precipitation, Mn and Fe form \n\nrespectively ?-MnO2 (vernadite) and FeOOH. Both compounds incorporate trace \n\nelements, such as Co, Pb, Ti and rare earth elements (REE), by surface sorption. The \n\nMn/Fe ratio is about 1 and Mn, Cu, and Ni concentrations are relatively low (HALBACH et \n\nal., 1981; VERLAAN; CRONAN; MORGAN, 2004; GLASBY; LI; SUN, 2013). \n\nDiagenetic precipitation is characterized by enrichment in Mn, Cu and Ni \u2013 metals \n\nreleased by diagenesis of sedimentary organic matter \u2013 and Mn/Fe ratios >5. Mn \n\nprecipitates as phyllomanganates, which exhibit lattice vacancies in which divalent cations \n\nlike Ni\n2+\n\n, Cu\n2+\n\n and Zn\n2+\n\n are incorporated (BURNS; BURNS, 1977).  \n\nThe morphology and geochemistry of polymetallic nodules are extremely dependent \n\non their genetic process. A classification of polymetallic nodules in terms of their genetic \n\nmechanism was proposed by Halbach et al. (1981) and is still widely used. This \n\nclassification divides nodules into type A (diagenetic), type B (hydrogenetic) and type AB \n\n(mixed-type). Most of polymetallic nodules are classified as type AB and form at \n\nintermediate grow rates of tenths of mm Myr\n-1\n\n (HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013). This is the case \n\nof the nodules from the CCZ and the Central Indian Basin (HEIN et al., 1997; VINEESH et \n\nal., 2009; GONZ\u00c1LEZ et al., 2010; MAYUMY AMPARO et al., 2013). Type A nodules are \n\nfound in the Peru Basin (WEGORZEWSKI; KUHN, 2014), while type B nodules are found \n\nin the Cook Islands (HEIN et al., 2015). \n\nBacterial activity may play a role in the mineralization process of nodules, as \n\nsuggested by the finding of Mn-cycling bacteria within nodules layers (WANG et al., 2009; \n\nWANG; GAN; M\u00dcLLER, 2009; BL\u00d6THE et al., 2015). However, the details about \n\nbacterially-induced mineralization are still to be understood. \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nEnvironmental conditions determine which genetic type is dominant in a given \n\npolymetallic deposit (figure 1) (HEIN; PETERSEN, 2013). Upon consolidated sediment \n\nand even on hard rock substrate polymetallic nodules grow on total exposure to seawater. \n\nIn these conditions nodule accretion is dominantly hydrogenetic. In contrast, diagenetic \n\naccretion dominates in unconsolidated and porous sediment, where metal are remobilized \n\nin interstitial water. Mixed-type nodules, formed by a combination of hydrogenetic and \n\ndiagenetic growth, are more common on seamounts and in deep sedimentary basins. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 Formation environments of polymetallic nodules, from hard rock at seamounts to porous \nsediment at deep ocean basins. From Hein and Petersen (2013). \n\n \n\nThe type of substrate is not the only factor to govern the accretion process of \n\nnodules. The availability of nuclei and the sediment composition, together with the organic \n\nmatter input to the sediments, are fundamental in determining which accretion process \n\nprevail. Typical nuclei for nodule accretion are shells, shark\u2019s teeth, whale\u2019s ear-bones, \n\nweathered volcanic rocks, pumice, hardened sediment, and fragments of nodules formed \n\npreviously (GLASBY, 2006).  \n\nThe main factor controlling the intensity of diagenesis is the sedimentation rate of \n\norganic matter, which in turns is a result of biological productivity in surface waters \n\n(HALBACH, 1986). Regions of the ocean where the surface primary productivity is higher \n\ncorrespond to the ones in which the seafloor hosts diagenetic polymetallic nodules, as for \n\nexample the Peru Basin (DYMOND et al., 1984) and the eastern South Atlantic (KASTEN \n\net al., 1998). Low productivity surface waters, on the other hand, correspond to those \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\nsettings where hydrogenetic nodules are found, like in the southwestern Pacific Basin \n\n(GLASBY, 2006) and in the Brazilian Basin (KASTEN et al., 1998). \n\nRegarding the polymetallic nodules composition, nodules tend to be enriched in Mn, \n\nFe, Ti, Mg, P, Ni, Cu, Mo, Zn, Co, Pb, Sr, V, Y, Li and REEs relative to the surrounding \n\nsediments, while they tend to be in Si, Al and Ba, indicating that these elements have a \n\nterrigenous origin (PATTAN; PARTHIBAN, 2011). \n\nThe morphology of nodules reflects the conditions of their formation (BATURIN, \n\n1988). Morphological aspects have been used to classify polymetallic deposits, in that a \n\nrelationship exists between nodules size, abundancy, distribution, Mn/Fe ratio and tonnage \n\nof elements of economic interest (MAYUMY AMPARO et al., 2013; VALSANGKAR; \n\nREBELLO, 2015). According to (VINEESH et al., 2009), characteristics such as size, \n\nshape and surficial texture depend on oceanographic variables of the basin where the \n\nnodules are formed, namely topography, currents, bottom water masses and sediment \n\ntype. Smooth surficial texture has been related to dominantly hydrogenetic growth \n\n(MAYUMY AMPARO et al., 2013).  \n\nMorphological studies relying on a high number of samples have been performed \n\n(VINEESH et al., 2009; MAYUMY AMPARO et al., 2013; VALSANGKAR; REBELLO, \n\n2015). Nevertheless, none of them considered in detail the internal structure of the \n\nnodules. Nowadays, thanks to the CT X-ray tomography, it is possible to obtain a high \n\nresolution imaging of the interior of the nodules in a non-destructive way, without the need \n\nof cutting the nodules, as performed in this study. \n\nRegarding their internal structure, polymetallic nodules present individual concentric \n\nlayers which may be inhomogeneous in composition and texture. This heterogeneity is \n\nconsidered to be due to changes in environmental conditions during nodules accretion. \n\nHydrogenetic and diagenetic growth have been found to be alternate between individual \n\nnodule layers (WEGORZEWSKI; KUHN, 2014), revealing that nodule growth is not in a \n\nsteady-state and does record changes in environmental conditions during nodule \n\nformation.  \n\nDespite the extensive literature on the genesis of deep sea polymetallic nodules, \n\nthe link between formation mechanisms, internal structure, external morphology and \n\ngeochemical composition of nodules is still poorly documented. \n\nMoreover, even though the occurrence of polymetallic nodules on the flank of the \n\nRio Grande Rise was reported by Milliman and Amaral (1974), no scientific work exists \n\nabout their morphological and geochemical characterization, or about how these deposits \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nwere formed. This is the first study in which the morphology and the geochemical \n\ncomposition of a nodule from this region are studied in detail, which is of great importance \n\nfor marine research in Brazil. \n\nThis Master Thesis aims to test the hypothesis that polymetallic nodules from \n\ndifferent ocean regions may exhibit distinct morphology and chemical compositions, \n\nalthough they were formed by the same process (diagenetic or hydrogenetic).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\n2. OBJECTIVES \n\nThe main goal of this work is to link the mechanisms of nodules formation with their \n\nmorphology and chemical composition in four ocean regions. For this purpose, \n\npolymetallic nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone (Northeast Pacific Ocean), the \n\nCentral Indian Basin (Central Indian Ocean), the Mascarene Basin (Western Indian \n\nOcean) and the Rio Grande Rise (Southwest Atlantic) were studied aiming to attain the \n\nfollowing objectives: \n\n? Describe and compare nodules from different locations, focusing on their external \n\nmorphology (size, shape and surficial texture); \n\n? Describe and compare nodules from different locations, focusing on their internal \n\nstructure (thickness and texture of layers and nuclei); \n\n? Determine the major, trace and rare elements composition across the nodules; \n\n? Reveal the geochemical processes that might have acted in the different ocean \n\nbasins. \n\n \n\nThe fundamental questions that this work addresses are the following: \n\n? Do the samples used in this work match the genetic type classification described \n\nin the literature for the regions under study? \n\n? Does Mn/Fe ratio vary in the same way in all the basins? \n\n? Why does this variation happen? And why does it not? \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n \n\n3. STUDY AREAS AND CORRESPONDING NODULES DEPOSITS \n\nThe Clarion-Clippertone Zone (CCZ) corresponds to the ocean basin comprised \n\nbetween the Clarion Fracture Zone and the Clipperton Fracture Zone (figure 2B). The \n\nocean floor at the site is 4000-4500 m deep, punctuated by volcanic seamounts rising up \n\nto 2500 m. Deep-sea plains alternated with elongated, approximately N-S oriented horsts \n\nand grabens of several kilometres length and height of 100-300 m.  \n\nThe flat, sediment-covered seafloor is composed by pelagic clay and siliceous ooze \n\n(diatoms and radiolaria), deposited at a rate of 0.35-0.5 cm kyr\n-1\n\n (MEWES et al., 2014). \n\nSediment lacks carbonates as the site is slightly below the carbonate compensation depth. \n\nFerromanganese nodules abundance is on average 10 to 30 kg m\n-2\n\n (RUHLEMANN et al., \n\n2011).  \n\nDissolved oxygen is detectable in the sediment pore water until 2-3 m below sea \n\nfloor (MEWES et al. 2014). Oxygen measurements in pore water suggest that \n\nhydrogenetic and oxic-diagenetic processes control the present-day growth of nodules at \n\nthe study area, since Mn from deeper anoxic sediments is does not reach the sediment \n\nsurface (MEWES et al. 2014; RUHLEMANN et al. 2011). \n\nThe equatorial high bioproductivity zone is located south of the CCZ and produces \n\none of the broader oxygen minimum zones in the global ocean, as a result of upwelling in \n\nthe eastern Pacific (STRAMMA et al., 2008). The oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is broad, \n\nwith a thickness of 400 \u2013 1000 m, which is more pronounced off Mexico and gradually \n\nweakens to the north and west (ZHENG et al., 2000). \n\nThe carbonate compensation depth (CCD) in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone is \n\nbetween 4200 and 4500 m water depth (INTERNATIONAL SEABED AUTHORITY - ISA, \n\n2010). Sediment distribution is influenced by the Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) low \n\nbottom-current velocities, which is less than 10 cm s\n-1\n\n predominantly north-westward and \n\nhighly oxygenated (JOHNSON, 1972). \n\nThe Central Indian Basin (CIB) is an isolated basin bounded by three ridge systems \n\non its western (Central Indian Ridge), eastern (Ninety Ridge System) and southern (Mid-\n\nIndian Ridge) limits (figure 2C). These ridges act as barrier to strong bottom water currents \n\nand terrigenous sediments from all around with exception of the northern boundary. \n\nConsequently, the CIB is covered by terrigenous sediments in the northern part (from \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nGanges and Bhramaputra rivers) (up to 5\u00b0S latitude). The rest of the basin is covered by \n\nsiliceous radiolarian ooze with sporadic calcareous patches (central part) and red clay \n\n(southern part) (BANERJEE; MIURA, 2001). Sedimentation rates in the CIB are between \n\n2.7 and 3.4 mm kyr\n-1\n\n (BANAKAR; GUPTA; PADMAVATHI, 1991) and the bottom \n\nmorphology varies between abyssal hills and seamounts.  \n\nThe CIB\u2019s physical characteristics provide a favourable environment for the \n\npolymetallic nodules to grow, being this the basin richest in nodules in the whole Indian \n\nOcean. Dominant parameters controlling nodules in the CIB are topography, bottom water \n\ncurrent and water depth (VINEESH et al., 2009). Nodules from the central deep basin are \n\nlarge, older and rough, while they are small and smooth in the southeastern part, where \n\nthe Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) enters through deep saddles in the Ninety Ridge \n\nSystem. Also, small and smooth nodules dominate locally on the top of seamounts. Older \n\nnodules from the protected deeper basins are of diagenetic origin and less influenced by \n\nstrong water current, while bottom water currents lead to Fe-rich small and smooth \n\nnodules in the eastern part of the basin affected by the AABW (VINEESH et al., 2009).  \n\nThe Mascarene basin (MB) is comprised between Madagascar Island and the \n\nMascarene Plateau and is located to the north of Mauritius Island (figure 2C), formed by \n\nbasic volcanic rocks, extruded as lava flows. The sediment type of the basin is mostly \n\ncalcareous clay/ooze. The sediment composition varies from sand to silt in shallower \n\nareas to mostly silt clay in deep water. The sediment coarse fraction is composed by \n\npreserved planktonic foraminifera, as the basin is above the CCD and the effect of \n\ndissolution is not pronounced. Clay minerals are composed mostly of montmorillonite, \n\nkaolinite and chlorite, which are indicative of tropical weathering of basic volcanic rocks. \n\nSedimentation rate in the Mascarene Basin is low, especially in the northern part, between \n\n1.4 and 11.3 m kyr\n-1\n\n (NATH; PRASAD, 1991).  \n\nPolymetallic nodules from the Mascarene Basin have been studied and found to be \n\nof hydrogenetic origin based on their internal structures and on morphological, chemical, \n\nand mineralogical characteristics. Their surficial texture is mostly smooth, growth layers \n\nare dominantly columnar, with vernadite as the main Mn mineral phase, enriched in Fe, \n\nCo, REE (Ce in particular) and depleted in Mn, Ni and Cu. These nodules originate from \n\nan oxygenated environment, due to the presence of Antarctic Bottom Water with low \n\nsedimentation rates (NATH; PRASAD, 1991). \n\nThe Rio Grande Rise (RGR) is an elevation of more than 4000 m from the \n\nsurrounding abyssal basin in the Brazilian Basin, western South Atlantic (figure 2D). The \n\n\n\n21 \n \n\nsediments at the crest of RGR are dominantly calcareous ooze (nannofossils and \n\nplanktonic foraminifera) with a siliceous component (FLORINDO et al., 2015). The area is \n\ncharacterized by a strong northward flow of the AABW, which causes erosion of the \n\nbottom sediments (EMELYANOV, 2015). The RGR bottom environment and its \n\npolymetallic deposits are yet to be described and understood. \n\nPolymetallic nodules from the west South Atlantic Ocean have been found to be \n\nmostly hydrogenetic in origin compared to the mostly diagenetic nodules from the eastern \n\nSouth Atlantic (KASTEN et al., 1998). Moreover, the sediments from the North Brazilian \n\nBasin have been described as hydrogenetic polymetallic deposits enriched in \n\nhydrothermal Fe and Mn oxyhydroxides relative to other basins in the Atlantic Ocean \n\n(DUBININ; RIMSKAYA-KORSAKOVA, 2011). \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 General map (A) with locations of samples from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone (B), Central \nIndian Basin and Mascarene Basin in the Indian Ocean (C), and Rio Grande Rise in the Southwest \n\nAtlantic Ocean (D).

Samples and methods summary \n\nPolymetallic nodules used in this work are from the CCZ (4 nodules) in the Pacific \n\nOcean, from the CIB (5 nodules), from the MB (3 nodules) in the Indian Ocean and from \n\nRGR (1 Fe-Mn coated pebble) in the southwestern Atlantic. \n\nThe samples from the CCZ are identified as JC120-104 and were collected during \n\nthe oceanographic cruise JC120 on board of the RRV James Cook by Agassiz trawl on \n\n14/5/2015 at 21:20:00 GMT at the location 13\u00b0 30.42\u2019N, 116\u00b0 35.1295\u2019W and 4130 m \n\ndepth (figure 1). The nodules from the CIB were collected during different cruises: AAS21 \n\nand AAS40 on board of RV Akademic Alexander Sidorenko (Galenzik, Russia) by Okean \n\nGrab.  \n\nNodules from the MB were collected during the oceanographic cruise SK35 on \n\nboard of the ORV Sagar Kanya (Ministry of Earth Sciences [MoES; formerly Department of \n\nOcean Development (DOD)], Government of India) during October-November 1987 by \n\nDredge, Vann Grab and Freefall Grab (table 1). The Fe-Mn coated pebble from the RGR \n\nwas collected by accident together with material dredged from the bottom during the \n\noceanographic cruise Iat\u00e1-Piuna on board of the R/V Yokosuka. \n\n \n\nTable 1 Polymetallic nodules geographic coordinates and depth. \n\n   Latitude   Longitude   Depth   Method  \n\nCentral Indian Basin \n      AAS 40 (308) -12\u00b0 3.642\u2019 74\u00b0 29.844\u2019 5060 Okean Grab \n\nAAS 21 (DR 17) -12\u00b0 30.204\u2019 75\u00b0 54.936\u2019 5410 - \n\nAAS 21(DR 19) -12\u00b0 25.098\u2019 75\u00b0 50.178\u2019 5350 - \n\nSS4 280G -12\u00b0 0.000\u2019 76\u00b0 30.540\u2019 5400 - \n\nF8(398 A) -15\u00b0 29.040\u2019 75\u00b0 59.460\u2019 5150 - \n\nF5 (212 B) -13\u00b0 59.880\u2019 74\u00b0 30.000\u2019 5255 - \nMascarene Basin \n(Western Indian \n\nOcean) \n      SK 35/24B  -15\u00b0 2.400\u2019 55\u00b0 4.000\u2019 4420 Dredge \n\nSK 35/27  -17\u00b0 0.400\u2019 56\u00b0 1.500\u2019 4528 Vann Grab \n\nSK 35/26A  -16\u00b0 0.000\u2019 55\u00b0 59.500\u2019 4130 Freefall Grab \nClarion-Clippertone \n\nZone \n      JC120-104A 13\u00b0 30.420\u2019 -116\u00b0 35.100\u2019 4130 Agassiz Trawl \n\nJC120-104B 13\u00b0 30.420\u2019 -116\u00b0 35.100\u2019 4130 Agassiz Trawl \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\nJC120-104C 13\u00b0 30.420\u2019 -116\u00b0 35.100\u2019 4130 Agassiz Trawl \n\nJC120-104D 13\u00b0 30.420\u2019 -116\u00b0 35.100\u2019 4130 Agassiz Trawl \n\nRio Grande Rise       \n\nRGR - - - - - Dredge \n\n \n\nThe nodules were photographed, measured and finally scanned by three \n\ndimensions X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT). The shape and surface texture were \n\nclassified following the nomenclature used by Glasby (1977) and Vineesh et al. (2009), in \n\nwhich the shape is: (1) spheroidal; (2) ellipsoidal; (3) discoidal; (4) tabular; (5) polynodules \n\n(6) biomorphic \u2013when it reflects the shape of a biological material; or (7) faceted \u2013 when it \n\nfollows the angular shape of a clastic nucleus. In this classification, the surface texture is \n\ndefined as: (1) rough; (2) smooth or (3) botryoidal. The layers textures were classified \n\naccording to Halbach et al. (1981) as: (1) massive; (2) dendritic; (3) laminar; or (4) \n\ncolumnar. \n\nNext, thin sections with approximately 100 \u00b5m thickness were prepared from the \n\nnodules JC120-104B, AAS21-DR19, SS4-280G, SK35/24B and SK35/26A. These thin \n\nsections were used for Scanning Electron Microcopy and for two kinds of Synchrotron \n\nanalyses, namely Micro X-ray Fluorescence and X-ray Absorption Near Edge. Polished \n\nsections 7 \u2013 8 mm thick were also prepared for Laser Ablation \u2013 Inductively Coupled \n\nPlasma Mass Spectroscopy (LA-ICP-MS) analysis at the National Oceanographic Centre, \n\nSouthampton, UK. \n\n \n\n4.2.

Preparation of thin sections and polished sections  \n\nThin sections (100 \u00b5m thick) were prepared at the Institute of Geoscience of the \n\nUniversity of Sao Paulo. Firstly, the nodules were embedded in a 6:1 solution of epoxy \n\nresin and hardener and kept under vacuum (-25 mPa) for six hours in order to ensure resin \n\npenetration. Samples were then dried in an oven for two days. \n\nOnce the resin was completely dried, the nodules were cut in two halves. A second \n\ncut was made parallel to the first one, in order to get a slab approximately 5 mm thick. The \n\nfirst cut was done using a metal jaw and the second one was done using a diamond wire, \n\nboth using water cooling. \n\nThe surface of the slabs was impregnated with epoxy resin to avoid material loss \n\nduring grinding. To do this, the slabs were placed onto a hot plate where a solution of \n\nepoxy resin, hardener and acetone was poured onto the slab surface. \n\nOnce the resin was dried, the slabs were grinded on a diamond wheel 320 with SiC \n\n600 grit. Then, the slabs were placed on glass slides and cut into 100 \u00b5m sections. Next, \n\nthey were polished using a polish cloth 8\u2019\u2019 DiaMat from Allied High Tech Products under \n\n180 RPM rotation adding a mixture of alumina 1 \u00b5m and Ethane Diol oil. Finally, the thin \n\nsections were coated with carbon to give them the electric conductivity necessary for SEM \n\nanalysis. \n\nPolished sections were also prepared for LA-ICP-MS analyses at the National \n\nOceanographic Centre. The nodules sections embedded in resin were cut into a 7 \u2013 8 mm \n\nthick slab and their surface was grinded using a 37 \u00b5m fixed diamond wheel, making sure \n\nto keep the sample flat. Then, the samples were lapped using 9 ?m SiC on flat glass to \n\nremove any grinding marks and to prepare the surface for polishing. Polishing of the \n\nsamples was done on a flat wheel with 15um, 9um, 3um, and finally 1um diamond at 80 \n\nrpm for around 10 minutes each. The samples were cleaned between each stage and \n\nwere polished in different orientations to prevent striations. \n\n \n\n4.4. Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs were performed using a Leo \n\n440i from Leo Electron Microscopy Ltd at the Laboratory of Scanning Electron Microscopy \n\n(LabMEV), Institute of Geosciences of the University of Sao Paulo. \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nSecondary Electron (SE) and Backscatter Electron (BSE) micrographs were taken \n\nfrom selected points previously observed by optical microscopy. The control of the \n\npositions of each point was possible due to a XY coordination system standardized \n\nbetween the optical microscope and the SEM. Analyses were performed at high vacuum \n\ncondition with Electron High Tension (EHT) of 20 keV, Work Distance (WD) of 25 mm and \n\nIprobe of 1.0 - 2.0 nA (probe current).  \n\nEnergy Dispersive Spectroscopy was performed in a Si (Li) solid state detector with \n\nINCA 300 software from Oxford Microanalysis group.  \n\n \n\n4.5. Synchrotron Radiation Analyses \n\nSynchrotron Radiation analyses applied in this work included micro X-ray \n\nFluorescence (\u00b5-XRF) and X-ray Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) and were \n\nperformed at the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS), XRF Beamline, from 19th \n\n\u2013 23th September 2016 and from 14th \u2013 18th February 2017. Thin sections of the samples \n\nJC120-104B, AAS21-19, SS4-280G, SK35-26 and SK35-24 were analyzed in order to \n\nmap the distribution of elements and to gather information on the oxidation state of Fe and \n\nMn present in the nodules. \n\nMicro-XRF punctual measurements were performed in triplicate at selected points in \n\nall nodules in order to obtain the elemental composition. Afterwards, 0.1 mm thick \n\ntransects across the nodules were performed to get profiles of elemental composition \n\nvariability. Those transects were obtained on steps of 0.02 mm and count time per point of \n\n600 ms, with a velocity of 0.0328 mm.s\n-1\n\n. \n\nBoth punctual analysis and maps, including transects, were acquired at 10 keV. \n\nFilters of Fe 3 mm plus Fe 6 mm were used because of the high content of Fe in the \n\nsamples, what caused dead time of nearly 100%. After adding the filters, the dead time \n\ndropped to less than 10%. \n\nThe spectrograms were then processed using the open software PyMCA Software \n\nVersion 5.1.2, downloaded from http://pymca.sourceforge.net/download.html, where the \n\ncurves were calibrated, Excel files were generated and color maps were obtained. From \n\nthe Excel files, curves of relative elemental concentration were plotted and the Mn/Fe ratio \n\nwas calculated. \n\nhttp://pymca.sourceforge.net/download.html\n\n\n27 \n \n\nXANES measurements were realized focusing on the absorption spectra of Fe and \n\nMn for samples JC120-104B, SS4-280, SK35-26, and RGR, thus one nodule analyzed for \n\neach ocean basin considered. XANES scans were performed three times for each point, in \n\norder to increase analytical precision. Metal foils of Mn and Fe were used for beam \n\ncalibration. Internal standards of FeOOH, FeO, Fe2O3, MnO, MnO2 and Mn3O4 were also \n\nscanned. XANES curves were processed using the Athena Software from the Demeter \n\nXAS package, available at https://bruceravel.github.io/demeter/. XANES data processing \n\nincluded pre-edge and post-edge normalization. Each XANES datum results from the \n\naverage of the triplicate measurements. Self-absorption correction was not performed \n\nbecause no stoichiometric formula of the sample matrix is available. However, this \n\ncorrection is not critical for the purpose of this study, because self-absorption affects only \n\nthe height of the peaks but not their position on the energy axis. The identification of the \n\nMn and Fe species were done by comparing the energy position of the first derivative of \n\nthe samples curve with the patterns curves using the Athena Software. \n\n \n\n4.6. Laser Ablation - Inductively Coupled Plasma \u2013 Mass Spectroscopy \n\nElemental analyses were performed by LA-ICP-MS at the National Oceanographic \n\nCentre, Southampton using a New Wave UP213 laser ablation system coupled to a \n\nThermo X-Series II quadrupole ICP-MS. \n\nPolished section of nodules JC120-104B, AAS21-19, SS4-280, SK35-26, SK35-24 \n\nand the coated pebble RGR were loaded into the laser\u2019s sample holder along with \n\npolished chips of NIST 610, NIST 612, BHVO-2G and BCG-2G reference glass standards. \n\nThe tranference of ablated material into the ICP-MS occurs through He flow via a three \n\nport mixing bulb. All ICP-MS and laser settings were optimized for optimal sensivity and \n\nstability. \n\nThe New Wave laser system software was used to map across each sample and \n\nstandard and to set the shot positions, which were aligned along a transect across the \n\nnodule sample with shot interval space of 0.25 mm.  \n\n \n\nTable 2 Parameters used for LA-ICP-MS measurements. \n\nSpot size Pulse rate Energy He flow Ar flow Acquisition  \n\nTime \n\nWash time  \n\nbetween shots \n\nhttps://bruceravel.github.io/demeter/\n\n\n28 \n \n\n25 um 5 Hz 25% 1000  \n\nmL.min\n-1\n\n \n\n400-600 \n\nmL.min\n-1\n\n \n\n20 s 40 s \n\n \n\nA set of multiple measurements of the standards was performed every one hour. \n\nEach of the four standards was measured 10 times under the same parameters used for \n\nthe sample material.  \n\nData calibration was carried out by producing a 5-point calibration line using the \n\nvalues of: (1) gas blank; (2) average NIST 610; (3) average NIST 612; (4) average BHVO-\n\n2G; and (5) average BCR-2G.  \n\nReference concentration values for the analytes of interest are the \u201cpreferred\u201d \n\nvalues extracted from the GeoReM database [see: georem.mpch-mainz.gwdg.de]. \n\nCalibration factors were determined for each element by comparing the measured \n\nCounts per Second (CPS) values of the standards with their certified concentration. These \n\nfactors were then applied to calibrate all unknown shots (external calibration). The element \n\nFe (\n56\n\nFe) could not be determined due to the mass interference of Ar and O (\n40\n\nAr\n16\n\nO). \n\n \n\n4.7.

RESULTS \n\n5.1. Clarion-Clippertone Zone, Northeast Pacific Ocean \n\nNodules from the CCZ (JC120-104A, JC120-104B, JC120-104C and JC120-104D) \n\nare 8 cm average long, discoidal and exhibit rough surface textures (figure 3 A-D). The \n\nsurface texture is more botryoidal than rough on the top side (figure 4A) and purely rough \n\non the bottom side (figure 4B), where the nodule surface is more friable. The CCZ nodules \n\npresent also a pronounced rim marking the transition between rough and rough-botryoidal \n\ntexture. This rim corresponds to the limit between the buried and exposed portion of the \n\nnodules (i.e., the sediment-water interface). Biological structure like whitish-beige worm \n\ntubes and radiolaria tests are found attached to the nodules surface on both sides, but \n\ndominantly on the botryoidal one (figure 4C and D). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 Nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone. \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 Surface texture of nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone. (A) top and (B) bottom side \nand hard organisms attached to (C) top and (D) bottom side of nodule JC120-104B. \n\n \n\nRegarding the internal structure, nodules from the CCZ present no apparent \n\nnucleus and two distinct structure patterns: (1) an internal and (2) an external one. Both of \n\nthem show a variable layering (figure 5). The internal portion shows alternation of porous \n\nand massive thick (1-3 mm) layers. The high-density contrast between these layers can be \n\nvisualized by the variability of grey tons on the tomography images (figure 5). This portion \n\nof nodule apparently grew in a preferential direction, resulting in a conic geometry \n\nindicated by the yellow arrow in figure 5. The external portion, however, presents \n\nalternation between thin (50-200 \u00b5m) bright and dark layers which grew all around the \n\ninternal portion. This fact suggests that the internal portion of the nodule likely served as \n\nnucleus for the external portion. Thus, the internal portions of the CCZ nodules likely \n\ncorrespond to a former deposit that experienced different environmental conditions in \n\ncomparison to the recent deposit, as reflected by their distinct morphological aspects. This \n\nformer deposit comprises 60 \u2013 80% of the nodules size. Still, the recent oxide layer is \n\nthicker on the one side relatively to the opposite one (figure 6). The morphological features \n\nof the nodules from the CCZ in the Pacific Ocean are summarized by table 3. \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 Tomography of nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone in three dimensions. \n\n \n\nThe SEM micrographs revealed in detail the texture of layers inside the nodules. \n\nThe thin layers encountered within the external portion are mostly botryoidal, with variable \n\ngrey tone and variable thickness, much thinner than the layers from the internal portion \n\n(figure 6A). The micrographs confirm that the bright thick layers are massive and alternate \n\nwith the porous layers in which the rock grew following a cauliflower \u2013 dendritic pattern, as \n\ndescribed by Halbach et al. (1981) (figure 6B and 6C).  \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 Polished section of nodule JC120-104B and Scanning Electron Microscopy \u2013 Secondary \nElectron micrographs showing the layers texture: (A) Botryoidal texture on the external portion, (B) \n\ndendritic and (C) massive textures in the internal portion.

Mn and Fe \n\nalternate in a way in that Mn-rich layers correspond to the more porous ones, while the \n\nFe-rich layers correspond to the more massive ones. Mn is accompanied by Ni, and at a \n\nlower degree by Cu. Fe, on the other hand, is accompanied by Cl and Ti to a lesser \n\ndegree. Si is highly concentrated at some spots, where detrital material is probably \n\npresent.  \n\nMicro-XRF analyses reveal that the elemental composition of nodules consists \n\nmainly of Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Zn, Ce, Ca, Ti, Co, Sr and K (table 4). The most noticeable \n\nfact is the high standard deviation of the values, showing the high compositional \n\nvariability inside each nodule.  \n\nLA-ICP-MS data show that the most dominant elements are Mn, Si, Ca and K, \n\nwhich concentration is given in %. All the other elements are expressed in ppm and \n\npresent the following order of magnitude: (1) 10000 ppm for Ti, Ni and Cu; (2) 1000 ppm \n\nfor Co, Zn, Sr, Ba, Pb and the total REY; (3) 100 ppm for V, Y, Zr, Nb, Mo, La, Ce and \n\nNd; (4) 10 ppm for Sc, Cr, Pr, Sm, Eu, Gd, Dy, Er, Yb, Hf, Th and U; (5) 1 ppm for Cs, \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nTb, Ho, Tm and Lu; and (6) 0.1 ppm for Ta and Pt (Appendix A table 1). Like for the \u00b5-\n\nXRF data, the element concentrations obtained by LA-ICP-MS are highly variable, with \n\ngenerally high standard deviations (table 4).  \n\n \n\nTable 4 Mean and standard deviation of chemical elements measured by ?-XRF in counts and LA-\nICP-MS in % and ppm for JC120-104B. \n\n?-XRF Mean \nStd \ndeviation \n\n \n\nLA-ICP-\nMS \n\nn=124 Mean \nStd \ndeviation \n\nMn 23903.72 15164 \n\n \n\nMn % 42.68 19.23 \n\nFe 2795.14 1638.99 \n\n \n\nSi % 5 2.79 \n\nCu 665.64 354.78 \n\n \n\nCa % 1.58 0.75 \n\nNi 542.24 282.6 \n\n \n\nK % 1.31 0.46 \n\nZn 186.22 179.78 \n\n \n\nNi ppm 12298.91 7654.93 \n\nCe 87.57 54.32 \n\n \n\nCu ppm 11658.03 6731.24 \n\nCa 37.9 38.26 \n\n \n\nZn ppm 3578.35 2687.49 \n\nTi 30.9 34.99 \n\n \n\nTi ppm 2542.8 2599.83 \n\nCo 25.42 46 \n\n \n\nCo ppm 1395.26 1693.19 \n\nSr 3.14 4.58 \n\n \n\nSr ppm 595.47 405.06 \n\nK 2.16 7.52 \n\n \n\nREY ppm 521.39 473.7 \n\nMn/Fe 10.68 8.86 \n\n \n\nCe ppm 289.55 372.47 \n\n  \n\nWhen looking at the element concentration profile obtained by \u00b5-XRF across the \n\nnodule JC120-104B, it is possible to see that CCZ nodules present a distinct alternation \n\nbetween Mn enriched and Fe enriched layers, both on the external and the internal \n\nsample as evidenced by the ?-XRF maps and the curves (figure 8). In these elemental \n\ncomposition maps, Mn and Fe signal intensities are represented by red and green color \n\nscales, respectively. Metal composition diagrams also show that Ni and Cu follow the \n\nbehavior of Mn, while Co and Ti follow the behavior of Fe. The Mn/Fe ratio varies \n\nbetween 2 and 40 with mean value of 10. The highest Mn/Fe ratios (up to 40) are found \n\nin the massive layers in the internal portion of the nodule. A correspondence between \n\nthick and massive layers to high Mn content and porous texture to high Fe content is \n\nobserved. \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 (a) Sample JC120-104B from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone, Northeast Pacific Ocean, (b) \u00b5-\nXRF measurements of elemental composition along the transects on the outer part and on the inner \n\npart of the nodule. (c) Color map of Mn (red) and Fe (green). \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 LA-ICP-MS elemental composition along the transects (a) A-A\u2019 and C-C\u2019 on the outer part of \nthe nodule and (b) B-B\u2019 on the inner part of the nodule JC120-104B from the Clarion-Clippertone \n\nZone, Northeast Pacific Ocean. \n\n \n\nResults of LA-ICP-MS measurements across the JC120-104B sample show that \n\non the bottom side of the nodule (transect A-A\u2019) Cu varies in harmony with Mn, while Ti \n\nand the REE show an opposite behavior (figure 9). However, on the top side of the \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nnodule (transect C-C\u2019) the opposite behavior of the groups Cu-Mn and Ti-REE is not \n\nobserved, nor is it observed across the first half of the points analyzed in the internal \n\nportion. Still, REE are less concentrated in the bottom side. It is relevant to remember \n\nthat the external layers at the top side are thinner than the bottom one. \n\nThe alternation between Mn-rich and Mn-poor layers exists. Fe could not be \n\nmeasured by this analytical technique, but relying on the fact that the Mn pattern is the \n\nsame as the one obtained by \u00b5-XRF, the Fe pattern is predicted to be similar as well. In \n\nthe internal portion, the Mn concentration obtained by LA-ICP-MS seems not to agree \n\nwith the ?-XRF data, since the highest Mn concentration does not always correspond to \n\nthe massive layers, as it was found based on ?-XRF data.  \n\nXANES spectra of the four points measured in nodule JC120-104B showed the \n\nfirst derivative closest to the energy of the standards Mn3O4 and MnO2 (on the X axis) \n\n(figure 10). The height of the curve (on the Y axis) is meaningless, since it is disturbed \n\nby a self-absorption effect that could not be corrected for. In the same way, the spectra \n\nof Fe absorption showed the first derivative closest to Fe2O3 and FeOOH. These results \n\nindicate that both the Mn and the Fe present in the nodule are present in the oxidized \n\nform.  \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 XANES measurements of Mn and Fe in standards and in four points in nodule JC120-104B \n(the points analyzed are numbered from 1 to 4).

Central Indian Basin \n\nNodules from the Central Indian Ocean (AAS40, AAS21-17, AAS21-19, SS4-280 \n\nand F8-398) are 3-6 cm long (figure 11) with spheroidal to elongate shape, except for \n\nnodule F8-398a that is faceted. These nodules present a rough to smooth surface texture \n\nall over their surfaces as exemplified by AAS21-19 (figures 12), with the exception of \n\nnodule F8-398a which is smooth. Biological structures, like hard worm tubes, are also \n\nfound upon the nodules surface, but to a lesser degree relative to the CCZ nodules. \n\nThree of the four nodules from the Central Indian Basin are polynucleated (figure \n\n13), which results from oxides growth around more than one nucleus. In these nodules, \n\nthe nuclei correspond to 40-50% of the nodules volume. Nodule SS4-280, on the other \n\nhand, is mononucleated and exhibits a small nucleus relative to its size (10%). Layer \n\ntexture varies between dendritic and botryoidal, with a high-density contrast between the \n\ntwo textures (figure 14). The dendritic layers present the highest porosity. The \n\nmorphological aspects of the nodules from the CIB are summarized in table 5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11 Nodules from the Central Indian Basin. \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 Surface texture of nodule AAS21-17 from the Central Indian Basin. \n\n \n\nFigure 13 CT tomography of nodules from the Central Indian Basin. \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 Polished sections of nodules AAS21-19 and SS4-280 with their layer textures viewed under \nSEM \u2013 Secondary Electron. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nTable 5 Summary of the morphological features of nodules from the Central Indian Basin, Indian \nOcean. \n\n \nAAS21-17 AAS21-19 AAS40 SS4-280 F8 \n\nNodule size (cm) 6.5 x 4 x 3.5  4.5 x 4 x 3  5 x 3.5 x 3  4 x 3 x 3  \n3 x 3 x \n2.5 \n\nShape ellipsoidal spheroidal ellipsoidal spheroidal faceted \n\nSurface texture rough rough rough rough-smooth smooth \n\nNucleus polinucleated polinucleated polinucleated mononucleated - \n\nNucleus/Nodules \nratio 50% 40% 50% 10% - \n\nInternal layering \nyes, highly \nvariable \n\nyes, highly \nvariable \n\nyes, highly \nvariable \n\nyes, highly \nvariable - \n\nLayer thickness           \n\nLayer Texture \n\nalternated \nbetween \ndendritic, \nmassive and \nbotryoidal \n\nalternated \nbetween \ndendritic, \nmassive and \nbotryoidal \n\nalternated \nbetween \ndendritic, \nmassive and \nbotryoidal \n\nalternated \nbetween \ndendritic, \nmassive and \nbotryoidal - \n\n \n\nNodules from the CIB are composed mainly by Mn, Fe, Cu, Ni, Co, Zn, Ca, Ti, Ce, \n\nK and Sr and show similar chemical characteristics (table 6 and 7).

Cu and Ni \n\nare the more abundant metals after Mn and Fe and vary similarly to Mn. Co and Ti are \n\ngenerally close to detection limit, which results in very noisy signals. However, the signals \n\nget stronger where Fe abundance is higher. \n\nTable 6 Mean and standard deviation of chemical elements measured by ?-XRF in counts and LA-\nICP-MS in % and ppm in sample AAS21-19. \n\n?-XRF Mean \nStd \n\ndeviation \n\n \n\nLA-ICP-\nMS \n\nn=124 Mean \nStd \n\ndeviation \n\nMn 23903.72 15164 \n\n \n\nMn % 42.68 19.23 \n\nFe 2795.14 1638.99 \n\n \n\nSi % 5 2.79 \n\nCu 665.64 354.78 \n\n \n\nCa % 1.58 0.75 \n\nNi 542.24 282.6 \n\n \n\nK % 1.31 0.46 \n\nZn 186.22 179.78 \n\n \n\nNi ppm 12298.91 7654.93 \n\nCe 87.57 54.32 \n\n \n\nCu ppm 11658.03 6731.24 \n\nCa 37.9 38.26 \n\n \n\nZn ppm 3578.35 2687.49 \n\nTi 30.9 34.99 \n\n \n\nTi ppm 2542.8 2599.83 \n\nCo 25.42 46 \n\n \n\nCo ppm 1395.26 1693.19 \n\nSr 3.14 4.58 \n\n \n\nSr ppm 595.47 405.06 \n\nK 2.16 7.52 \n\n \n\nREY ppm 521.39 473.7 \n\nMn/Fe 10.68 8.86 \n\n \n\nCe ppm 289.55 372.47 \n\n\n\n43 \n \n\nTable 7 Mean and standard deviation of chemical elements measured by ?-XRF in counts and LA-\nICP-MS in % and ppm in sample SS4-280. \n\n?-XRF Mean \nStd \n\ndeviation \n\n \n\nLA-ICP-\nMS \n\nn=102 Mean \nStd \n\ndeviation \n\nMn 11361.45 2019.03 \n\n \n\nMn % 38.2 16.5 \n\nFe 2486.87 823.92 \n\n \n\nSi % 6.14 3.57 \n\nCu 757.08 233.57 \n\n \n\nCa % 1.84 0.67 \n\nNi 498.79 121.28 \n\n \n\nK % 1.1 0.29 \n\nZn 34.35 19.05 \n\n \n\nCu ppm 22839.21 11124.88 \n\nCa 27.5 31.02 \n\n \n\nNi ppm 17314.7 8631.43 \n\nTi 14.81 42.19 \n\n \n\nZn ppm 2490.52 1334.74 \n\nCo 14.09 21.56 \n\n \n\nTi ppm 2155.31 1301.48 \n\nSr 1.34 1.26 \n\n \n\nCo ppm 1248.95 519.33 \n\nCe 0.6 1.11 \n\n \n\nSr ppm 652.15 265.6 \n\nK 0 0 \n\n \n\nREY ppm 476.93 240.48 \n\nMn/Fe 5.13 2.04 \n\n \n\nCe ppm 404.94 233.6 \n\n \n\nFigure 15 (a) Sample AAS21-19 from the Central Indian Ocean, (b) \u00b5-XRF measurements of \nelemental composition along the transect (A-A\u2019).

Mascarene Basin \n\nNodules from the Mascarene Basin are, on average, 4 cm long and strongly \n\nspheroidal (SK35-26 and SK35-27) or elongate (SK35-24) (figures 20). Their surface \n\ntexture is smooth and homogeneous on all sides (figure 21). Some of them results from \n\nclustering of two or more smaller nodules (SK35-26 and SK35-27), the surface of which is \n\nalso characterized by micro botryoides. Biological structures are absent on the spheroidal \n\nspecimens.  \n\nCT tomography revealed that nodule SK35-24 comprehends an elongated nucleus \n\nwhich occupies most of the nodule volume (up to 80%), with a thin oxide layer (figure 22). \n\nIn contrast, nodules SK35-26 and SK35-27 present small nuclei (22 to 40% of the total \n\nvolume) and thick ferromanganese layers. Both are the result of the clustering of two or \n\nmore nodules, and it is possible to identify the layer grown after the clustering. CT \n\ntomography shows that the MB nodules are internally homogeneous, with no density \n\ncontrast between the layers. \n\n \n\nFigure 20 Nodules from the Mascarene Basin. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 21 Surface texture of nodules SK35-24 and SK35-26 from the Mascarene Basin. \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 22 CT Tomography of the exterior and internal parts of nodules from the Mascarene Basin. \n\nSEM micrographs enabled the classification of the layers texture as columnar \n\nacross the entire nodule (figure 23), following the description of HALBACH et al.

However, the \n\nnodules from the MB differ clearly from the CCZ and CIB because they exhibit Mn/Fe \n\nratios closer to 1 over most of their length (figures 24 and 25). They also differ from the \n\nCCZ and the CIB nodules in that they are significantly enriched in Ti and Co which, \n\ninstead of Cu and Ni, are the most abundant elements after Mn and Fe.  \n\nTable 9 Mean and standard deviation of chemical elements measured by ?-XRF in counts and LA-\nICP-MS in % and ppm in sample SK35-24. \n\n?-XRF Mean \nStd \n\ndeviation  \nLA-ICP-\n\nMS \nn=68 Mean \n\nStd \ndeviation \n\nFe 13507.74 3296.47 \n \n\nSi % 31.85 15.2 \n\nMn 10876.3 3531.45 \n \n\nMn % 30.8 39.22 \n\nCo 447.94 100.11 \n \n\nCa % 3.75 3.65 \n\nTi 281.6 62.95 \n \n\nK % 3.44 2.38 \n\nCa 174.93 52.04 \n \n\nTi ppm 21512.13 19932.88 \n\nNi 20.41 24.33 \n \n\nCo ppm 6419.2 8718.44 \n\nK 6.58 18.36 \n \n\nNi ppm 4419.8 5162.82 \n\nCu 5.14 9.34 \n \n\nCe ppm 3394.87 4160.74 \n\nCe 1.58 4.63 \n \n\nCu ppm 2670.02 2288.27 \n\nSr 0.42 1.8 \n \n\nSr ppm 2206.23 2761.69 \n\nZn 0 0 \n \n\nREY ppm 1502.35 1659.14 \n\nMn/Fe 0.83 0.24 \n \n\n     \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nTable 10 Mean and standard deviation of chemical elements measured by ?-XRF in counts and LA-\nICP-MS in % and ppm in sample SK35-26. \n\n\u00b5-XRF Mean \nStd \n\ndeviation \n\n \n\nLA-ICP-\nMS \n\nn=126 Mean \nStd \n\ndeviation \n\nFe 9263.96 4605.37 \n\n \n\nMn % 19.01 13.67 \n\nMn 8402.64 4416.71 \n\n \n\nSi % 10.06 2.98 \n\nTi 386.89 223.37 \n\n \n\nCa % 2.62 1.3 \n\nCo 354.63 163.68 \n\n \n\nK % 1.03 0.45 \n\nCa 148.94 68 \n\n \n\nTi ppm 19826.22 14383.95 \n\nNi 48.12 44.92 \n\n \n\nCo ppm 3883.38 3274.52 \n\nCe 22.95 22.92 \n\n \n\nNi ppm 3021.61 2247.8 \n\nCu 2.54 7.58 \n\n \n\nCe ppm 2407.49 1775.41 \n\nK 0.68 5.35 \n\n \n\nCu ppm 1620.15 958.89 \n\nSr 0.3 1.11 \n\n \n\nSr ppm 1449.22 919.17 \n\nZn 0.27 1.77 \n\n \n\nREY ppm 1129.66 766.13 \n\nMn/Fe 0.93 0.26 \n\n \n\nZn ppm 945.59 562.84 \n\n \n\nLA-ICP-MS analysis shows that Ti concentration is higher than that of Cu (figures \n\n26 and 27).

Rio Grande Rise \n\nThe nodule from the Rio Grande Rise is 2 cm long, spheroidal, with a micro \n\nbotryoidal surface texture surrounded by orange material (figure 29). One of its sides is \n\ncovered by fine calcareous tests (figure 29D).  \n\nThe RGR coated pebble is made up by a thin oxide layer formed around the \n\nnucleus, which represents almost 90% of the nodule\u2019s volume (figure 30). Changes in the \n\ngrey scale suggest that the oxide layer is generally 0.2 mm thick, reaching 0.7 mm on one \n\nside (figure 31). A single layer of variable thickness \u2013 0.5 to 0.3 mm \u2013 surrounds the \n\nnucleus.  \n\nThe texture of the thicker portion of the layers is laminated to botryoidal, while in the \n\nthinner portion it is dendritic (figure 31). The morphological features of the RGR coated \n\npebble are summarized in table 11. \n\n \n\nFigure 29 Coated pebble from Rio Grande Rise (RGR); (A) bottom side and (B) top side; (C) surface \ntexture on opposite sides; (D) foraminifer attached to the nodule surface. \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 30 Tomography of nodules from the Mascarene Basin from the exterior and slices on three \ndimensions. \n\n \n\nFigure 31 Polished section of RGR and micrographs of Scanning Electron Microscopy \u2013 Secondary \nElectron showing the layers texture.

In order of abundance, the RGR coated pebble is composed of Fe, Mn, \n\nCa, Co, Ti, Ni, K, Sr, Cu and Zn. The elemental abundance across a transect from the \n\nnodule\u2019s external surface to the nucleus show Mn/Fe ratio &lt;1, as well as constant Fe, Mn, \n\nTi and Co values (figure 32). Ni presents a noisy signal because of low concentration. The \n\nnucleus is enriched in Ca, as indicated by the color map, due to the presence of a high \n\nnumber of foraminiferal tests. \n\nTable 12 Mean and standard deviation of chemical elements measured by ?-XRF in counts and LA-\nICP-MS in % or ppm for RGR. \n\n\u00b5-XRF Mean \nStd \n\ndeviation \n\n \n\nLA-ICP-\nMS \n\nn=24 Mean \nStd \n\ndeviation \n\nFe 937.48 1226.71 \n\n \n\nCa % 42.68 41.56 \n\nMn 640.08 738.72 \n\n \n\nMn % 18.96 24.45 \n\nCa 525.91 306.4 \n\n \n\nSi % 13.66 7.56 \n\nCo 41.81 55.64 \n\n \n\nK % 2.19 1.56 \n\nTi 15.36 21.13 \n\n \n\nTi ppm 15345.92 15817.27 \n\nNi 15.12 25.12 \n\n \n\nCo ppm 7054.63 8710.1 \n\nK 14.57 9.56 \n\n \n\nNi ppm 4394.14 5896.1 \n\nSr 3.17 2.03 \n\n \n\nREY ppm 2894.46 1592.26 \n\nCu 2.95 5.74 \n\n \n\nSr ppm 2873.4 1289.27 \n\nZn 1.43 2.49 \n\n \n\nCe ppm 2034.59 2278.72 \n\nCe 0 0.05 \n\n \n\nCu ppm 1449.62 1420.84 \n\nMn/Fe 0.82 0.59 \n\n \n\nZn ppm 1091.54 1149.51 \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\n \n\nLA-ICP-MS results reveal that the coated pebble from RGR has the lowest Mn \n\ncontent of all the nodules studied (table 10).

Also, REE concentrations in transect 1 are higher \n\nthan in transect 2. \n\n \n\nFigure 32 (a) Sample RGR from the Rio Grande Rise, southwest Atlantic Ocean.

Statistical analysis \n\nThe Principal Component Analysis performed using the ?-XRF average \n\nconcentrations of chemical elements shows that most of the chemical elements group \n\ntogether, excepting for Mn and Fe that are separated (figure 35). The two Principal \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nComponents (PC1 and PC2) together explain 97.8% of the total variance of the data. The \n\nsamples from the CCZ and the CIB are more influenced by Mn, Cu and Ni. On the other \n\nhand, the samples from the MB and the RGR are more influenced by Fe, Ca, Co and Ti.\n\n \n\nFigure 35 Principal Component Analysis calculated for the average values of the chemical elements \nfor the \u00b5-XRF data with the scores of each Principal Component. Total variance explained by the two \n\ncomponents together is 97.8%. \n\n  \n\nThe same analysis was applied for the LA-ICP-MS data and the Principal \n\nComponents encountered were similar (figure 36). The nodules are segregated \n\nbetween those which are more influenced by Cu and Ni (nodules from the CCZ and \n\nCIB) and the ones which are more influenced by Ti and Co (nodules from the MB and \n\nRGR coated pebble). Mn appears as a non-influent element, however its measurement \n\nunit is % while Ni and Cu is expressed in ppm, which in absolute value Mn is minor than \n\nthe values of Ni and Cu (for example, 10% of Mn compared to 10000 ppm of Ni). \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 36 Principal Component Analysis calculated for the average values of the chemical elements \nfor the LA-ICP-MS data with the scores of each Principal Component.

DISCUSSION \n\n6.1. Mechanisms of formation of polymetallic nodules \n\nThe nodules studied present similarities regarding their morphology and \n\ngeochemistry, which give insights into the mechanisms of formation common to all the \n\nnodules.  \n\nDistinguishable concentric layers and high standard deviation of the elements \n\nconcentration reveal that the accretion process does not happen always in the same \n\nway and at the same rate. The Mn/Fe ratio high variance indicates that the conditions of \n\nformation of nodules changed many times. Dymond et al. (1984) first evinced that the \n\naccretion process in nodules from the Equatorial Pacific Ocean is characterized by non-\n\nsteady-state process. \n\nThe chemical composition is basically the same in all the nodules and is \n\nrepresented by 41 chemical elements from the dataset in this work, from Si to U (see \n\nSupplementary Material) recognized with a combination of different analytical \n\ntechniques.  \n\nMn and Fe are the dominant elements as usually occurs in nodules, once Mn and \n\nFe oxides are the matrix material (HEIN; KOSCHINSKY, 2014). This seems to be true \n\nfor the global ocean, including the recently recovered nodule from the Rio Grande Rise \n\n(this work). \n\nSi, Ca and K are also found in high abundance in the nodules studied. However, \n\nPrincipal Component Analysis shows these elements are associated neither to the Mn \n\nmineral phase nor to Fe one. Si and K are known to come from detrital aluminosilicates, \n\nwhile Ca, Ba and Sr come from  pelagic biogenic material. Both groups make up a \n\ndetrital mineral phase incorporated during the nodules accretion (GLASBY; LI; SUN, \n\n2013; HEIN; KOSCHINSKY, 2014). Finally, most of the trace metals (Cu, Ni, Co and Ti) \n\ncan be split into those associated to the Mn mineral phase and those that are \n\nassociated to the Fe one (see the PCA results, figure 35 and 36). This segregation is in \n\nagreement with many previous findings which show that some metals are preferably \n\nincorporated into the Mn oxide while others are incorporated into the Fe oxyhydroxide \n\nstructure. Strong positive correlation between Mn and Ni, Cu and Zn was found in \n\nnodules from the CIB (PATTAN; PARTHIBAN, 2011). Mn oxides have the tendency to \n\nincorporate divalent cations like Ni\n2+\n\n, Cu\n2+\n\n and Zn\n2+\n\n, whereas Fe oxyhydroxide tend to \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nincorporate anionic species like HPO4\n2-\n\n, HAsO4\n2-\n\n, HVO4\n2-\n\n, MoO4\n2-\n\n and WO4\n2-\n\n, as well as \n\nREE and Co\n3+\n\n (GLASBY; LI; SUN, 2013).  \n\nIt was not possible to evaluate the association between Fe and the REE because \n\nof the limitation on the LA-ICP-MS technique in not distinguishing Fe. Nevertheless, the \n\nmost REE-enriched nodules correspond to the ones with higher Fe content and low \n\nMn/Fe ratio, which are the ones from the Mascarene Basin and the Rio Grande Rise. \n\nThese nodules are comparable to the hydrogenetic nodules of Cook Islands, which \n\npresent high REE content (HEIN et al., 2015). \n\nMost of the Mn oxide present in the nodules from the basins studied are \n\ncomposed of a mixture of Mn\n4+\n\n and Mn\n3+\n\n, revealing a high oxidation state for Mn. \n\nGlasby (2006) estimated that 98% of the Mn in deep sea nodules is Mn\n4+\n\n. This is in \n\nagreement with the oxidation state of Mn in the three main Mn oxides present in \n\nnodules, namely vernadite, todorokite and birnessite (BURNS; BURNS, 1977). Mn\n2+\n\n \n\nhas also been found incorporated to lattice vacancies of phyllomanganates when the \n\nMn\n2+\n\n upwards diffusion across the redox front is too high, but this chemical species was \n\nnot found to be relevant in none of the samples measured in this study. \n\nThe presence of Mn species in the sediments comes from the organic matter \n\ndiagenesis, in which Mn is reduced to Mn\n2+\n\n and is released to the pore water in the \n\nsuboxic sediment layer, together with Ni\n2+\n\n, Cu\n2+\n\n and Zn\n2+\n\n (CHESTER, 2003). Mn\n2+\n\n then \n\nmigrates to the oxic layer by diffusion and is oxidized to Mn\n3+\n\n and Mn\n4+\n\n, precipitating as \n\nphyllomanganates, which incorporate Ni\n2+\n\n, Cu\n2+\n\n and Zn\n2+\n\n in their lattice vacancies \n\n(GLASBY, 2006). Suboxic diagenesis precipitation of Mn may happen and results on a \n\nhigh flux of Mn\n2+\n\n into the Mn oxide structure (DYMOND et al., 1984; WEGORZEWSKI; \n\nKUHN, 2014). The suboxic diagenesis nodules accretion occurs when the redox front is \n\ncloser to the sediment-water interface, where the nodules are generally found. Suboxic \n\ndiagenesis results Mn/Fe ratios up to 500 and low Ni and Cu contents (BL\u00d6THE et al., \n\n2015). Such conditions were not observed in the nodules studied, thus this process \n\nseems to be not relevant for the formation of the nodules considered in this study.  \n\nFe is present in nodules generally as oxyhydroxides FeOOH (MARCUS et al., \n\n2015). However, hematite (Fe2O3) was found in small content in nodules (SHIRAISHI et \n\nal., 2016). Also, oxyhydroxides can change into hematite by dissolution and re-\n\nprecipitation, or by solid state transformation (LU et al., 2011). Therefore, the presence \n\nof Fe2O3 in some of the nodules may be explained by transformation of oxyhydroxides \n\ninto hematite. \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\nBased on the above considerations, oxic diagenesis and hydrogenetic accretion \n\nare possibly the dominant processes of formation for the nodules studied.  \n\n \n\n6.2. Characterization of the formation process in the different ocean \n\nbasins  \n\nThe morphological and geochemical features of the nodules from the CCZ are \n\nsimilar to those of the nodules from the CIB, while the nodules from the MB are similar \n\nthe coated pebble from the RGR (table 13 and figure 37). \n\nThe relative elemental abundance is different for each ocean region. Cu and Ni \n\nare enriched in nodules from the CCZ and the CIB. On the other hand, Co and Ti are \n\nenriched in nodules from the MB and coated pebble from the RGR. It is not coincidence \n\nthat this happens where the Mn/Fe is &lt;1. This information corroborates the idea that \n\ndiagenetic deposits are enriched in Mn, Cu, Ni, Zn and Mo, while hydrogenetic deposits \n\nare enriched in Fe, Co, Ti and REE (HEIN; KOSCHINSKY, 2014).  \n\n \n\nTable 13 Polymetallic nodules morphological aspects summary. \n\n  CCZ CIB MB RGR \n\nNodule dimensions \n    1-5 cm \n \n\nX x x \n\n5-10 cm x \n   Shape \n\n    Discoidal x \n   Subrounded \n\n \nX \n\n \nx \n\nRounded \n  \n\nx \n Surface texture \n\n    Rough x X \n  Botryoidal x X \n  Microbotryoidal \u2013 smooth \n\n  \nx x \n\nNucleus \n    Ancient deposit x \n\n   One sedimentary rock \n  \n\nx x \n\nMany sedimentary rocks \n \n\nX \n  Nucleus/Nodules ratio \n\n    0-50% \n \n\nX x \n 50-100% not applied \n\n \nx x \n\nInternal layering \n    \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 37 Hierarchical clustering of the nodules studied using the LA-ICP-MS data mean of chemical \nelements for each nodule. \n\nNodules from the CCZ fall into the mixed type category, according to the \n\nclassification of Halbach et al., (1981). The discoidal shape and different surface texture \n\non the top and bottom sides are in agreement with the model of growth by which \n\ndiagenetic formation occurs in the buried side of the nodule, while hydrogenetic \n\nformation occurs at the exposed side. Besides, the thicker recent oxide layer \n\ncorresponds to the rough side and the thinner to the smooth one. The diagenetic \n\naccretion process is known to happen at least one order of magnitude faster relative to \n\nhydrogenetic accretion (DYMOND et al., 1984), resulting in thicker layers in the buried \n\nside of nodules. \n\nThe chemical composition reflects some asymmetry between the top and the \n\nbottom side of the CCZ nodules too. It is possible to observe slight differences \n\nregarding the profiles of the Mn-Cu and Ti-REE pairs, which clearly vary in opposite \n\nways in the bottom side of the nodule and are not observed in the top side. \n\nhighly variable x X \n  little variable \n\n  \nx x \n\nThickness of layers \n    0.2 mm \n  \n\nx x \n\n2 mm x \n   Texture of layers \n\n    Massive x X \n  Dendritic x X \n  Botryoidal x X \n  Columnar \n\n  \nx x \n\nLaminated \n   \n\nx \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\nWegorzewski and Kuhn (2014) describe the Mn \u2013 Fe fractionation as a result of metals \n\nrelease due to the decomposition of organic matter within the sediments into the oxic \n\npore water.  \n\nTi and REE abundances occur with the same order of magnitude at both the top \n\nand the bottom side of the nodules from the CCZ, which can be explained by diffusion \n\nof the seawater into the first centimeters of sediment pore water. The metals released \n\nduring Mn reduction in the suboxic layer, however, may not reach the seawater when \n\nmigrating upward, or, if they do so, the dilution effect will be higher comparatively to the \n\none expected for metals diffusing downward as the seawater penetrates into surficial \n\nsediment pore water. This mechanism explains why the Mn/Fe ratio variation occurs in \n\nthe bottom side but not in the top side of the nodule exposed to seawater. \n\nThus, we can assume that the bottom side of the nodules- in contact with the \n\nsediment \u2013 undergoes metal precipitation under oxic diagenesis, while the top side \u2013 in \n\ncontact with the seawater \u2013 is undergoes hydrogenetic metal precipitation, as illustrated \n\nby figure 38.  \n\nThe overall geochemical composition of the CCZ nodules is characterized by \n\nhigher Ni and Cu contents in comparison to Co and Ti, as well as a higher Mn content \n\nrelative to Fe. Also, the REE concentration is &lt;500 ppm, much lower than the one in \n\nnodules from the MB and coated pebble from RGR. This geochemical fingerprint of \n\nnodules indicates a weak hydrogenetic component.  \n\nThe existence of nodules with no apparent nucleus was reported by Halbach et \n\nal. (1981), for what they give the explanation that the internal part of these nodules is a \n\nformer nodule functioning as adsorption surface for more recent concretions. They \n\nassociate these occurrences to the mixed type nodules in which nuclei are \n\npredominately composed of broken fragments of old nodules, mainly nodule debris of \n\nhydrogenetic nodules, which seems to be the case for the nodules from the CCZ \n\nstudied. However, the inner portion of the CCZ nodules is much more likely to result \n\nfrom diagenetic accretion, which can be deduced by both chemical and morphological \n\naspects. In these layers, the Mn/Fe ratio varies from 3 to 40 but it is never &lt;1, Ni and \n\nCu are highly abundant and bright, thick Mn-rich layers alternate with dendritic, Mn-\n\npoorer layers. Fragments of marine plankton are very common inside of the diagenetic \n\nmassive layers and are not observed in the other layers, as also reported by Halbach et \n\nal. (1981).   \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\nIn fact, the Mn/Fe ratio generally greater 10 (as high as 70) of the nodular nuclei \n\nfrom the CCZ nodules is characteristic of the suboxic diagenesis accretion described by \n\nDymond et al. (1984). However, these authors associate the high Mn content to high \n\nflux of Mn\n2+\n\n from organic matter regeneration within the sediment, so that Ni\n2+\n\n and Cu\n2+\n\n \n\nwould not be incorporated into the Mn oxide structure, resulting in a low Ni and Cu \n\ncontent. This is not found in the study, because high Ni and Cu contents are associated \n\nto high Mn/Fe ratios. Still, the Mn specie prevailing is Mn\n4+\n\n and Mn\n3+\n\n and not Mn\n2+\n\n. \n\nTherefore, oxic diagenesis is more likely to have occurred. \n\n \n\nFigure 38 scheme of the mixed-type nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone Zone environment of \nformation. \n\nThe nodules from the CIB do not present the same external asymmetry observed \n\nfor the nodules from CCZ. They are not discoidal, nor do they present a rim separating \n\ntwo different surface textures between exposed and buried sides.  \n\nMassive and dendritic layers are the main textures observed in the CIB nodules, \n\nwhich together with their spherical and spheroidal shapes and rough surface texture \n\nindicate a common diagenetic origin (HALBACH et al., 1981). Besides, Mn/Fe ratios > 5 \n\nand high Ni and Cu abundances relatively to Co and Ti confirm that they belong to the \n\ndiagenetic type category (HALBACH et al., 1981). Still, the REE content in these \n\nnodules is &lt;500 ppm, low in comparison to the MB nodules and RGR coated pebble \n\nand close to the CCZ ones. \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\nThe strong alternation of layer textures and variable Mn/Fe ratio indicates high \n\nenvironmental variability. Similarly to the CCZ nodules, the Mn-rich layers are enriched \n\nin Ni and Cu, while the few layers where Mn/Fe is lower (&lt;5) are poorer in these two \n\nelements and a slight rise in Co and Ti is noticed. Layers like this second case may \n\nrepresent a period of time when the nodules were subject to more oxic conditions.  \n\nHydrogenetic accretion is not likely to have occurred in the CIB nodules, since \n\nMn/Fe ratios do not reach 1 in the oxide layer. Also, the columnar layer texture that is \n\ntypical of this type of accretion (HALBACH et al., 1981) is not present. So the presence \n\nof low Mn/Fe layers is explained by exposure to oxic pore water rather than by direct \n\nexposure to seawater (hydrogenetic accretion), resulting on oxic-diagenetic precipitated \n\nFe-rich Mn layers (DYMOND et al., 1984). The oxic pore water entrains metals from the \n\nseawater (Fe, Co, Ti, REE) but still contains high content of Mn cations because of the \n\nreaction with sediment particles (oxic diagenesis). In another stage of growth, however, \n\nthis Mn flux from diagenesis was possibly higher, resulting in the high Mn/Fe, Ni and \n\nCu, and in massive layers, as illustrated by figure 39. This seems to have happened \n\nmore than once in all the studied nodules from the CIB.  \n\nNevertheless, this process seems to have happened differently between the two \n\nnodules (AAS21-19 and SS4-280) because of their level of internal symmetry. Nodule \n\nAAS21-19 is asymmetric internally, while SS4-280 is highly symmetric. Nodule SS4-280 \n\nhigh symmetry indicates that despite the accretion process variated during the nodule \n\ngrowth, it happened in the same way and velocity all around the nodule. Much of the \n\nasymmetry of AAS21-19 can be explained by the presence of multiple nucleation \n\ncenters. \n\nThis work suggests that the nodules from the CIB were formed buried within the \n\nfirst centimeters of oxic sediment where, moment of higher flux of metals from the \n\nseawater diffused to the pore water, alternated with moments when higher organic \n\nmatter input released more diagenetic-sourced metals (figure 39).  \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 39 Condition of formation of oxic-diagenetic nodules from the Central Indian Basin conditions of \nformation. (A) in the case of low sedimentation of organic matter and (B) in the case of high \n\nsedimentation of organic matter. \n\nThe nodules from the Mascarene Basin are very different from the ones \n\ndiscussed until now. Their morphology is very consistent with those of the nodules ruled \n\nsolely by hydrogenetic concretion described by Halbach et al. (1981). \n\nLooking into the interior of the nodules, the microstructures also seem to be \n\ncompatible with the Halbach et al. (1981) classification. The nodules from the MB, \n\nhydrogenetically formed, present regular and closely packed fabric with columnar \n\npatterns, which reflects the exterior surface causing the finely grained smooth texture. \n\nThe variable degree of reflectiveness power is due to variable abundance of Mn in the \n\nhydrogenetic material.  \n\nThe geochemical aspects of the nodules from the Mascarene Basin are very \n\ndistinct from the CCZ and CIB. They are typical polynodules from slopes and \n\nseamounts vicinity (HEIN et al., 2015). The relative elemental composition also reflects \n\nthe hydrogenetic formation, as the Fe content of these nodules is higher and the Mn/Fe \n\nis generally &lt;1. The low Ni and Cu content and higher Co and Ti content are in \n\nagreement with those expected for hydrogenetic accretion. Also, the Rare Earth \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\nElements content is > 1000 ppm, twice higher than the previous nodules. Despite the \n\nhydrogenetic signature of nodule SK35-24, its shape is not spheroidal because of its \n\nnucleus shape.  \n\nNodules from the MB have been studied before by Nath and Prasad (1991), who \n\nalso reported spheroidal 2 - 4 cm nodules with smooth surface texture, ?-MnO2 \n\ndominant mineral, enriched in Fe, Co and REE and depleted in Mn, Ni and Cu. Two \n\nmain mineral groups were found: (1) Ca, Fe, Mn, Co and Ti (hydrogenetic); and (2) Al, \n\nSi, K, Mg, Na and Cu (detrital) (NATH; PRASAD, 1991). Top-bottom fractionation was \n\nobliterated to what Nath et. al 1992 explained by the nodules turn-over. They observed \n\nmore REE-enriched and ?-MnO2-rich nodules in the western Indian Ocean and \n\nshallower depth in Central Indian Basin. They found strong correlation between Ca, Fe \n\nand REE and attributed the REE to be incorporated by the Fe oxyhydroxide phase. \n\nHowever, neither of the two studies investigated the chemical composition with spatial \n\nresolution as the present study does. \n\nThe high similarity all around the nodules indicates that the accretion did not vary \n\nmuch over the time, i.e. metal source and the rate of accretion. The fractionation \n\nbetween Mn-rich and Fe-rich layers does not occur in the MB nodules, or it occurs in \n\nsuch a small scale that it is not possible to identify. Their geochemical composition is \n\nmore homogenous regarding all the chemical elements. \n\nThe small size may be related to their general lower growth rate in comparison to \n\nthe other types, which explains also the low thickness of the internal layering. Their \n\nroundness is still little understood, as some authors hypothesize about a rolling \n\nmovement because of bottom currents but no evidence exists that the bottom current \n\nwould be able to move the nodules constantly. Also, the rolling movement would be \n\nexpected to occur in the entire nodule accretion time in order to give those perfect \n\nconcentric layers over the time. But from our observation, nodules attach together and \n\nthis would have required an interval of no movement long enough to the attachment to \n\nhappen (figure 40).  \n\nNodules from red clay sediments have been found to be hydrogenetically in \n\norigin (PATTAN; PARTHIBAN, 2011). However, the shape of the nodules from the MB \n\npoints to an exposed growth environmental set where they can eventually roll. \n\n \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 40 scheme of the hydrogenetic nodules from the Mascarene Basin environment of formation. \n(A) before and (B) after the nodules become attached. \n\nFinally, the investigation of the coated pebble from the RGR, even though it is \n\nonly one, reveals interesting facts about the environmental conditions from that region. \n\nRelying on its morphological and geochemical aspects it is possible to predict \n\nenvironmental conditions closer to the MB instead of the CCZ and the CIB for the RGR.  \n\nIn fact, it has been mentioned above already that small and spheroidal smooth \n\nsurface texture nodules are typical from slopes and seamounts vicinity and into the \n\nhydrogenetic genetic type. The abundance of well-preserved carbonate microfossils \n\nupon the nodules surface is a reliable hint that it is from a rise indeed, as carbonate \n\nshells would not be found well-preserved bellow the Carbonate Compensation Depth. \n\nThe planktonic foraminiferal lysocline \u2013 the depth below which the tests began to suffer \n\ndissolution - is around 4050 m in the RGR (MELGUEN; THIEDE, 1974). \n\nThe RGR fits into the environmental set expected for this type of nodules. \n\nBesides, the sole nodule studied reflects a hydrogenetic ruled accretion type also \n\ngeochemically. Its Mn/Fe ratio value is &lt;1 and the Ni and Cu abundance is low is \n\ncomparison to Co and Ti. Also, the REE is the highest found among the nodules \n\nstudied, being > 2800 ppm. \n\nThe morpho-geochemical fingerprint of the RGR coated pebble is compatible \n\nwith what is expected to the environmental set, comparable to the figure 40. Besides, \n\nnodules from the Brazilian Basin and the western South Atlantic Ocean as whole have \n\nbeen showed to be dominantly hydrogenetic in comparison with the eastern South \n\nAtlantic and even the Walvis Ridge system, which is also a seamount (XAVIER, 1982; \n\nKASTEN et al., 1998). \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\nThe presence of highly contrasting layers with inverse correlation between Mn \n\nand Fe - as well as their companion elements Cu-Ni and Co-Ti-REE respectively - \n\nwithin the diagenetic and mixed type nodules from the CCZ and CIB in comparison to \n\nmore homogenous layers with absent inverse correlations within the hydrogenetic Fe-\n\nMn oxides from the MB and RGR is the important question.  \n\nIt is suggested to be the result of the redox front close to the nodules location in \n\nthe sediment. Slight changes in the redox front up or downward define the availability of \n\nmetals for the nodules. Namely, it defines if exist a strong diffusion from the seawater to \n\nthe sediment or if exist a strong influence of metals coming from enhanced organic \n\nmatter diagenetic reaction in the suboxic layer. The redox front dictates the location of \n\nthe main geochemical reactions within the sediments, mainly the ones responsible for \n\nthe organic matter diagenesis.  \n\nThe hydrogenetic Fe-Mn oxides from the MB and RGR, in the other hand, are \n\nentirely columnar and the inverse correlation between Mn and Fe is absent, as well as \n\nbetween the other elements. Variation of Cu solely occurs in the nodules from the MB, \n\nbut it is not followed by Mn neither by Ti, which means that Cu varies for some other \n\nreason that is not the redox potential. This class of nodules form upon hard substrate \n\nentirely expose to the seawater in oxic environment. In this case there is no sediment \n\npore water, thus no diagenetic reaction occurs.  \n\nAs final consideration of the discussion section, this work reached its objectives. \n\nThe nodules studied are in agreement with previous characterizations of the deposits \n\nalready described (CCZ, CIB and MB). Also, further aspects were studied in this work \n\nadding to the previous description. A first characterization of a Fe-Mn oxides coated \n\npebble from the RGR is presented. \n\nThe variable Mn/Fe ratio previously observed in the nodules from the CCZ was \n\nfound to happen also in the CIB bit not in the MB and RGR. This enables for a \n\ngeneralization that this process happens only in the diagenetic and mixed-type nodules \n\nand is not detected in the hydrogenetic nodules. Since both diagenetic and mixed-type \n\nnodules form at unconsolidated sediments basins, the presence of the redox front \n\nseems to play the major role in the existence of the fractionation process, whereas the \n\nredox front is not present in the environment of formation of the hydrogenetic nodules. \n\nThose nodules in which the Mn \u2013 Fe fractionation happens correspond to the ones with \n\nthe most complex layer texture alternation (dendritic, massive and botryoidal), so the \n\nmorphology is a good indicator of the nodules genesis. \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\n7. CONCLUSIONS \n\nThe polymetallic nodules from the four ocean regions studied exhibit common \n\ncharacteristics and are formed fundamentally by the same two process, the oxic \n\ndiagenetic and the hydrogenetic accretion of Mn and Fe oxides. However, the nodules \n\ndiffer regarding which of these processes rule the growth processes, revealed by the \n\nmorphological and geochemical. Polymetallic nodules from the Clarion-Clippertone \n\nZone and the Central Indian Basin are dominantly formed by oxic diagenesis, whereas \n\nthe ones from the Mascarene Basin and Rio Grande Rise are hydrogenetic. \n\nAlso, the accretion process was not constant during the nodule growth, as \n\nrevealed by heterogeneous morphology and geochemistry of layers mainly in the \n\ndiagenetic and mixed-type nodules. In these nodules, the Mn/Fe ratio is highly variable, \n\nas well as the metals which are associated to them. The redox front influences \n\nunconsolidated sediments, where this type of nodules form, and variances on its depth \n\nis suggested as the main responsible. Hydrogenetic nodules form over hard rock or oxic \n\nunconsolidated sediment and the metals come from the water column solely. \n\nThe morphology itself reflects the Mn and Fe fractionation and may be used as \n\nan indicative of the environment of nodule formation, whether within the sediment layer \n\nor exposed to seawater. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n75 \n \n\nREFERENCES \n\n \n\nBANAKAR, V.
