The use of autogenous bone grafts has the incon-\nvenience of adding a surgical area for the removal of an\nadequate quantity of donor tissue.\n\nMurray et al. (4), Hurley et al. (5), Linghorne (6)\n\nand Melcher &amp; Dreyer (1) were the first to use physical\nbarriers creating an acceptable environment for osteo-\ngenesis through the exclusion of cellular elements of\nconnective tissue in the repair area of a surgical wound.\nExperimental bone defects created in mice jaws and\ncovered with polytetrafluoroethylene membrane showed\nbone regeneration (2). The biological principles of\nguided bone regeneration (GBR) can be used to in-\ncrease or to reconstruct aesthetically and functionally\nthe thickness and height of the atrophic alveolar edge\nand calvarial defects (7).\n\nMore recent experimental studies have demon-\nstrated bone neoformation with the use of other types of\nmembranes that act as physical barriers to exclude non-\nosteogenic soft tissue, so that the spaces created by the\nmaterial were repopulated by cells able to produce bone\ntissue (8,9). In addition, an appropriate space is created\n\n\n\nBraz Dent J 14(2) 2003\n\n120 N.L. de Macedo et al.\n\nwhere the natural biological potential can be expanded\nto assist the regeneration as desired (10).\n\nBased on previous research (1,2,4,6), this work\nwas an attempt to histologically evaluate the response\nof bone tissue and its regenerative potential after subpe-\nriosteal implantation of PTFE and HA physical barriers\nin the restoration of bone defects created in the rat femur.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nPhysical barriers\n\nTwo different types of non-absorbable material\nwere used in this study as physical barriers according to\nGBR biological principles. One is manufactured as a\nnon-porous PTFE film (Tecnoflon &amp; Brasflon, S\u00e3o\nPaulo, SP, Brazil) (11) and the other as small blocks of\ncoral hydroxyapatite (HA; Faculty of Chemistry of\nLorena, Lorena, SP, Brazil) (12). Both materials were\ncut to cover defects, extending for 2 to 3 mm beyond the\nmargins of the bone defects.\n\nSurgical procedure\n\nA total of 15 Albinus male rats, weighing 250-\n300 g, were used and were fed a commercially prepared\nsolid diet and water ad libitum.\n\nPreoperatively, the animals were anesthetized\nwith an intramuscular injection of aqueous solution of\nchlorhydrate of 2-(2,6-xylidine)-5,6-dihydro-4H-1,3-\nthiazine (Rompun, Bayer, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil) and\nketamine (Francotar, Virbac, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP, Brazil), in\nthe proportion of 1:0.5 ml in the dose of 0.1 ml/100 mg\nof body weight. After trichotomy and asepsis of the\noperative field, the lateral surfaces of the tibia, in both\nposterior paws, were exposed with removal of peri-\nosteal tissue to form concave cortical defects, approxi-\nmately 3 mm in diameter, with spherical surgical drills\nat low rotation and constant irrigation with sterile sa-\nline. The defects were created making superficial wastes\nwithout perforations. In the right posterior paw, a PTFE\nbarrier was placed to cover the defect, while in the left\npaw the defect was covered with small blocks of HA.\nFive mice were used as controls, and their defects were\nleft to repair naturally. The incisions were sutured with\n4-0 silk interrupted sutures (Ethicon-Johnson &amp; Johnson,\nS\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos, SP, Brazil), for a first intention\nrepair.\n\nHistological study\n\nThe animals were sacrificed with a high dose of\nthe anesthetic at 7, 14, 21 and 30 days post-operatively.\nAfter sacrifice, fragments including the implanted ma-\nterial were placed in labeled bottles for fixation in\n10% formalin solution, for a minimum of 48 h, and\ndecalcified in 20% formic acid. The PTFE barrier was\nsubsequently removed and the material was processed\nroutinely for histological evaluation (5-\u00b5m thick sec-\ntions and hematoxylin and eosin stain). The specimens\nwere analyzed with an optic microscope.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe HA blocks were totally removed by the\ndecalcification, with clear spaces remaining surrounded\nby connective tissue. These spaces were located close\nto the bone, eventually interposed among muscle fibers\nor in the subcutaneous connective tissue. In all experi-\nmental periods, septa of connective tissue were ob-\nserved projecting into the spaces.\n\n7 days\n\nControl: Discrete local bone neoformation in the\nperiphery of the cortical bone tissue was seen. This\nneoformation was continuous with compact bone tis-\nsue, in supracortical and subperiosteal disposition. The\nnewly formed trabeculae were perpendicular to the\ncortical bone tissue, with an immature aspect, with\nseveral osteocytes included and large osteoblasts aligned\nalong the trabeculae. The medullar spaces were filled\nby well-vascularized loose connective tissue. The peri-\nosteum was very cellular, in contact with the trabecu-\nlae, and more fibrous externally (Figure 1 top).\n\nPTFE: The barrier was outlined by connective\ntissue rich in fibroblasts and fibrocytes, well-vascular-\nized and with interstitial edema. Mono- and polymor-\nphonuclear inflammatory cells were present close to the\nbarrier, with fibrin deposit and remnants of necrotic\ntissue in some areas. Discrete formation of fibers was\nobserved more externally. The muscle fibers close to\nthe barrier were dissociated by edema, discrete inflam-\nmatory infiltrate and dilated and congested blood ves-\nsels. Subperiosteal bone neoformation was observed\nbetween the external surface of the bone and the inter-\nnal surface of the barrier. The newly formed bone\n\n\n\nBraz Dent J 14(2) 2003\n\nGuided bone regeneration with subperiosteal implants 121\n\nexhibited the same characteristics described for the\ncontrol (Figure 1 middle).\n\nHA: The HA fragments were surrounded by\ngranulation tissue exhibiting young fibroblasts, newly\nformed blood vessels, and discrete and diffuse mono-\nnuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate. At the interface\nwith the fragment, there were remnants of fibrin net,\ncontaining erythrocytes and polymorphonuclear neu-\ntrophils. More externally, there was a discrete fibrosis.\nNewly formed bone trabeculae, in general perpendicu-\nlar to the cortical bone tissue, with radiated disposition,\nin supracortical and subperiosteal location were ob-\nserved (Figure 1 bottom). The bone neoformation was\nseen mainly at the internal surface of the HA fragments;\nhowever, it was also observed in other external areas.\n\n14 days\n\nControl: The areas of bone neoformation showed\na more mature aspect than observed at 7 days. The\ntrabeculae were thicker, surrounded by large osteo-\nblasts, and the medullar spaces were smaller. Baso-\nphilic lines indicating bone resorption followed by\nneoformation were observed below this area.\n\nPTFE: Discrete fibrosis was observed around\nthe barrier, with a few inflammatory cells, especially\nmacrophages and eosinophils. One of the specimens\npresented a foreign body reaction between the bone and\nthe barrier. The interposition of muscle fibers between\nthe barrier and the bone was observed in some areas.\nThe newly formed tissue was thinner than that observed at\n7 days, and was more mature with lamellar trabeculae.\n\nHA: The newly formed bone tissue presented a\nmore mature aspect than that observed at 7 days, with\nsmaller medullar spaces.\n\n21 days\n\nControl: The newly formed bone trabeculae were\nlamellar, sometimes irregular and immature.\n\nPTFE: The barrier was surrounded by fibrous\nconnective tissue, containing some macrophages at the\ninterface with the material. The newly formed bone\ntissue was mature, with lamellar trabeculae; however,\nin 2 specimens it presented wide medullar spaces,\noutlined by osteoblasts and containing numerous fatty\ncells.\n\nHA: The newly formed bone tissue presented\n\nthick lamellar trabeculae and reduced medullar spaces.\n\n30 days\n\nControl: The newly formed bone exhibited\nremodelation aspects, with the presence of basophilic\nlines indicating resorption and bone neoformation (Fig-\nure 2 top).\n\nFigure 1. 7 days.

The newly\nformed bone exhibited a mature aspect with concentric\nlamellae around vascular channels (Figure 2 middle).\n\nHA: The HA fragments were surrounded by\nfibrous connective tissue, with discrete mono- and poly-\n\nmorphonuclear inflammatory infiltrate, especially in\nthe septa of connective tissue that projected into the\ninterior of the space. The newly formed bone tissue\nshowed mature lamellar trabeculae and small medullar\nspaces. Newly formed cartilage was eventually ob-\nserved contiguous with the HA fragments or with the\nconnective tissue that surrounded the fragments (Fig-\nure 2 bottom).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAlthough this was not the main objective, this\nhistological study confirmed the biocompatibility of\nphysical barriers, previously reported by Macedo et al.\n(11,12). However, HA caused a more pronounced in-\nflammatory response that persisted for the entire study\nperiod without effects on bone neoformation (13). Hy-\ndroxyapatite can attract circulating biocomponents to\nsites of tissue repair to promote bone repair (14,15).\n\nThe microscopic analysis demonstrated the lo-\ncation of the barrier of PTFE sometimes close to the\nbone and sometimes separated from the bone by muscle\ntissue. Around the barrier, there was an inflammatory\nreaction, initially characterized by edema, vascular con-\ngestion and mono- and polymorphonuclear inflamma-\ntory infiltrate. As already reported by Macedo et al.\n(11), the inflammatory reaction decreased its intensity\nwith time, the infiltrate became mainly macrophagic\nand the formation of collagen fibers began. Up to 30\ndays, fibrous dense connective tissue was observed\naround the membrane, with rare macrophages in con-\ntact with it.\n\nBone neoformation was observed in the bone\nouter surface, located directly over the pre-existent\ncortical bone plate and under the periosteum. This bone\ntissue was initially immature and became more mature\nduring subsequent periods, going from cancellous bone,\nwith many cellular bone trabeculae that delimited wide\nmedullar spaces, to compact bone tissue, with forma-\ntion of osteons and parallel bone lamellae. As in the\nstudies of Murray et al. (4) and Mecher &amp; Dreyer (1),\nthe bone neoformation, in the present study, showed a\ncontinuous protuberance that stood out from the adja-\ncent bone profile.\n\nThe importance of the blood coagulum and the\nuse of physical barriers in bone defects in several\nclinical situations has been reported (1,5,7,12,16). In\nthis study, physical barriers (PTFE and HA) on the bone\n\nFigure 2. 30 days. Top: Control. Bone with remodelation aspect\nwith resorption and remodelation. H&amp;E.

The physical barrier protects the blood coagu-\nlum from moving away due to the mechanical stress\nthat acts on the flap during the earliest phase of wound\nrepair. Micromovements of the flap in the initial phase\nof repair are enough to modify the differentiation of\nmesenchymal cells from osteoblasts to fibroblasts (17).\nThe displacement and the movement of the membrane\naffect the stabilization of the surgical wound and the\nblood coagulum would be colonized by connective\ntissue cells. Fibroblasts growing more quickly occupy\nthe bone defect preventing osteogenesis.\n\nIn this study, the variation of the amount of\nnewly formed bone was due to the fact that physical\nbarriers were placed on the defects without the aid of\nsutures or microscrew fixation. This made their dis-\nplacement possible, inducing variations in the shape\nand dimension of the space for bone growth. However,\nwhen the membrane remained in place, large amounts\nof bone neoformation were obtained, even during the\ninitial periods of the study. The correlation between the\nmaintenance of the space and the amount of bone\nneoformation in rats was shown. On the other hand, in\nthe control group, in which no type of physical barrier\nwas used, there was also a small amount of bone\nneoformation as a consequence of the absence of su-\ntures in the deepest planes of the surgical wound, and\nprobably periosteum stimulation due to the raising of\nthe flap. In this case, tissues were not well adapted on\nthe bone defect, creating a narrow space between soft\nand bone tissues.\n\nSchmid et al. (18) and Weng et al. (19) reported\nthat the periosteum is not that important for guided\nbone regeneration techniques. Our study demonstrated\nbone neoformation without suture of the deepest planes,\nand isolation of periosteum by the barriers.\n\nThe critical size of the bony defects constituted\nanother important factor, and perhaps influenced the\nvariation in bone neoformation found in this study\n(19,20). Bone defects smaller than 5 mm are critical to\nstudy the bone neoformation because a natural regen-\neration occurs. In this study, the creation of concave\ndefects (no cavities) might have contributed for the\nosteogenic cells of the margins of the defect to supply\nelements for bone neoformation as a protuberance in\ncontinuity with the adjacent bone, in the space main-\n\ntained by the physical barriers.\nUnlike Dahlin et al. (2), this study also demon-\n\nstrated that bone regeneration using the GBR biologi-\ncal principles can also be obtained with non-porous\nphysical barriers, in agreement with the results of Schmid\net al. (18). Thus, we can suggest the use of non-porous\nPTFE physical barriers in the treatment of periodontal\ndisease bone defects, originating from endodontic and\ncystic lesions, osseointegrated implant associated de-\nfects, prevention and treatment of atrophy of the alveo-\nlar ridge, etc.\n\nThus, we conclude that: the physical barriers\nused in this study helped exclude the adjacent soft\ntissues, allowing the area of the bony defect to be\npreferentially repopulated by cells with osteogenic ca-\npacity; non-porous PTFE barriers fit better than HA in\nthe GBR biological principles, and results can be ex-\ntrapolated for the clinical treatment of several types of\nbone defects and the predictable osteopromotion in\nseveral clinical situations; the porosity and the integra-\ntion of the physical barrier were not absolutely neces-\nsary for bone neoformation in the GBR technique; the\namount of bone neoformation depended on the volume\nof the space created by the physical barriers.\n\nRESUMO\n\nA regenera\u00e7\u00e3o periodontal e do rebordo \u00f3sseo utilizando barreiras\nf\u00edsicas s\u00e3o procedimentos bem estabelecidos em cirurgias\nreconstrutivas.
