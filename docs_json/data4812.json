Thesis (Doctorate) \u2013 Faculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering, University of \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, Pirassununga, 2019. \n\n \n\nThe Amazon basin has about 7000 km2 of extension and a vast biodiversity providing an \n\nichthyofauna of approximately 5000 species of fish. Myxozoan parasites cause diseases in fish \n\nin both the natural environment and the breeding systemand they are responsible for high \n\nmortality rates. Myxozoans show a great diversity of species with some of them, highly \n\npathogenic and, therefore, have been receiving attention of the researchers. In Brazil, due to the \n\ngreat diversity of fish species, the study of these parasites has been gaining the attention of the \n\nresearchers, focusing on diversity, biology and parasite-host interaction. In this context, the \n\nobjective of this work was to explore the parasite diversity of the Myxozoa subphylum, through \n\nmorphological and molecular analyses of myxosporean parasites of Amazonian fish, important \n\nfor the food market such as Colossoma macropomum (tambaqui) and Piaractus brachypomus \n\n(pirapitinga). For the taxonomic study, morphological analyses were performed using light \n\nmicroscopy and molecular analyses using ssrDNA. The fish were captured in the Amazon \n\nbasin, in the Tapaj\u00f3s and Solim\u00f5es Rivers, Santar\u00e9m, PA and Manaus, AM, respectively. Two \n\nnew myxosporean species, Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 2, were described infecting \n\nC. macropomum, based on morphological and molecular data. Myxobolus colossomatis, found \n\ninfecting C. macropomum, was considered a distinct species of Myxobolus cf. colossomatis \n\ndescribed in Piaractus mesopotamicus, through molecular and phylogenetic data. For P. \n\nbrachypomus four new species were described. Henneguya n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 3, \n\nwere described through of morphological, histological, ultra-structural and molecular analyses. \n\nHenneguya n. sp. 2 and Myxobolus n. sp. 4 were described based in morphological and \n\nmolecular data. After observing the mitochondrial behavior of myxospores through electron \n\nmicroscopy studies, we performed an experiment of mitochondrial fluorescence microscopy \n\nand the results showed that few Henneguya sp. myxospores presented labeling for \n\nmitochondrial activity. \n\n \n\nKey-words: Myxozoa, ssrDNA, tambaqui, pirapitinga, Amazon River, mitochondrial \n\nfluorescence microscopy. \n\n\n\n \n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nCAPODIFOGLIO, K.

Tese (Doutorado) \u2013 Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade \n\nde S\u00e3o Paulo, Pirassununga, 2019. \n\n \n\nA bacia Amaz\u00f4nica tem cerca de 7000 km2 de extens\u00e3o e uma vasta biodiversidade abrigando \n\numa ictiofauna de, aproximadamente, 5000 esp\u00e9cies de peixes. Parasitos mixozo\u00e1rios s\u00e3o \n\ncausadores de doen\u00e7as em peixes de ambiente natural e de sistemas de cria\u00e7\u00e3o sendo \n\nrespons\u00e1veis por altas taxas de mortalidade. Mixospor\u00eddeos apresentam uma grande diversidade \n\nde esp\u00e9cies com algumas destas, altamente patog\u00eanicas e, por isso, v\u00eam recebendo aten\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\npesquisadores. No Brasil, devido \u00e0 grande diversidade de esp\u00e9cies de peixes, o estudo destes \n\nparasitos vem ganhando cada vez mais destaque, com foco para a diversidade, biologia e a \n\nintera\u00e7\u00e3o parasito-hospedeiro. Neste contexto, o objetivo deste trabalho foi explorar a \n\ndiversidade de parasitos do subfilo Myxozoa, atrav\u00e9s de an\u00e1lises morfol\u00f3gicas e moleculares \n\nde mixospor\u00eddeos parasitos de peixes amaz\u00f4nicos, importantes para o mercado de alimentos \n\ncomo Colossoma macropomum (tambaqui) e Piaractus brachypomus (pirapitinga). Para o \n\nestudo taxon\u00f4mico foram realizadas an\u00e1lises morfol\u00f3gicas, utilizando microscopia de luz, e \n\nan\u00e1lises moleculares utilizando o sequenciamento do ssrDNA. Os peixes foram capturados na \n\nbacia Amaz\u00f4nica, nos rios Tapaj\u00f3s e Solim\u00f5es, Santar\u00e9m, PA e Manaus, AM, respectivamente. \n\nDuas novas esp\u00e9cies de mixospor\u00eddeos, Myxobolus sp. n. 1 e Myxobolus sp. n. 2, foram descritas \n\ninfectando C. macropomum, baseado em dados morfol\u00f3gicos e moleculares. Myxobolus \n\ncolossomatis encontrada infectando C. macropomum foi considerada uma esp\u00e9cie distinta de \n\nMyxobolus cf. colossomatis descrita em Piaractus mesopotamicus, atrav\u00e9s de dados \n\nmoleculares e filogen\u00e9ticos. Para P. brachypomus quatro novas esp\u00e9cies foram descritas. \n\nHenneguya sp. n. 1 e Myxobolus sp. n. 3 foram descritas atrav\u00e9s de an\u00e1lises morfol\u00f3gicas, \n\nhistol\u00f3gicas, ultra-estruturais e moleculares. Henneguya sp. n. 2 e Myxobolus sp. n. 4 foram \n\ndescritas baseadas em dados morfol\u00f3gicos e moleculares. Ap\u00f3s a observa\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\ncomportamento mitocondrial de mixospor\u00eddeos atrav\u00e9s de estudos de microscopia eletr\u00f4nica, \n\nn\u00f3s realizamos um experimento de microscopia de fluoresc\u00eancia mitocondrial e os resultados \n\nobtidos demonstraram que poucos mixosporos de Henneguya sp. apresentaram marca\u00e7\u00e3o para \n\na atividade mitocondrial.   \n\n\n\n \n \n\nPalavras-chave: Myxozoa, ssrDNA, tambaqui, pirapitinga, Rio Amazonas, microscopia de \n\nfluoresc\u00eancia mitocondrial. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES \n\nFigure 1.

Furthermore, the continent has a large number of rivers and lakes that constitute the \n\nlargest river basin in the world, the Amazon basin (TUNDISI, 2003). \n\nAmazonian effluents are born in the Andes mountain range, in Peru (TRANCOSO, \n\n2006), and it presents, in all its extension, a dense and complex network of streams, called \n\nigarap\u00e9s (JUNK, 1983). \n\nWith about 6.500 km2 of extension (GOULDING, 1996), Amazon basin is intersected \n\nby the Amazon River and thousands of others rivers (SIOLI, 1967) and is known for its vast \n\nwater availability, with approximately 20% of all fresh water on the planet (TUNDISI, 2003). \n\nIn addition to having plenty of water, the Amazon basin has a vast biodiversity and is \n\none of the planet's most productive and intact ecosystems (SANTOS; SANTOS, 2005), \n\nharboring an ichthyofauna of approximately 5000 species of fish (VAL; HONCZARYK, 1995).     \n\nAccording with Lundberg et al. (2000) it is believed that only 40% of the Amazonian \n\nichthyofauna is known, indicating that this system is poorly understood and underestimated. \n\nBrazil is home to a large part of this ichthyofauna, although the knowledge about its \n\ncomposition in the different Brazilian watersheds is deficient and irregular, such fact can be \n\nverified observing places with more species, with economic, ecological and social importance, \n\nand that several species threatened are not studied and preserved (MENEZES et al., 2007).  \n\n \n\n1.2 Amazonian fish of economic importance \n\n  Brazilian North, more specifically Amazonas and Par\u00e1 states, is one of the main region \n\nproducers of fish. In 2010, the region was responsible for than more two hundred thousand tons \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nof fish produced. Among the fish produced in the northern region the main targets in the \n\nextractive fishery are Characiformes fish. (MPA, 2012). \n\nThe Characiformes order is one of the largest groups of freshwater fish, with 2400 \n\nspecies divided in, approximately, 520 genera (NELSON, 2006). Serrasalmidae family, \n\nbelonging to Characiformes order, shelters fish known popularly as \u201cmyleus\u201d, \u201cpiranhas\u201d and, \n\nwith stand out, \u201cpacus\u201d (CALCAGNOTTO et al., 2005; MIRANDE, 2010). \n\nThe pacus group includes economically important species because they are considered \n\nhigh quality food, such as the species Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1816, commonly \n\nknown as \u201ctambaqui\u201d and Piractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818 known as \u201cpirapitinga\u201d \n\n(IBAMA, 2007). \n\nColossoma macropomum is the second largest scale fish in South America, weighing \n\nup to 30 kg and measuring approximately 90 cm in length, being a fish very appreciated by the \n\nriverside communities of the Amazon (LOPERA-BARRERO et al., 2011). \n\nTambaqui is a fish with solitary behavior and that survives in mineral-poor water \n\n(FROESE; PAULY, 2018).   \n\nIt is a frugivorous fish in adulthood, making it one of the main seed dispersers for many \n\nspecies of plants in the Amazonian floodplains (ANDERSON et al., 2011).  \n\nThe natural stocks of this species have been drastically reduced in recent years \n\n(SANTOS; SANTOS, 2005) and because this, the cultivation of this fish has been the solution \n\nfor overexploitation. Tambaqui is the most cultivated species in the Brazilian Amazon and is \n\nwidely used in breeding systems throughout the country, reaching 66% of all national \n\nproduction between 2007 and 2009 (LOPERA-BARRERO, 2011). \n\nIn 2011, Brazilian aquaculture produced about 628 thousand tons of fish. Of these, 544 \n\nthousand tons were produced by continental fish farming, with tambaqui being one of the main \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nspecies produced, making the country reach 12th place in the world ranking (BRAZIL, 2013a, \n\nBRAZIL, 2013b). \n\nPiaractus brachypomus, commonly known as \u201cpirapitinga\u201d, is a species that can to \n\nreach 80 cm in length and weigh up to 20 kg (SOBRINHO et al., 1984). It has an omnivorous \n\nfood habit, with tendency to herbivory, consuming fruits and seeds in the period of the flood, \n\nin which its availability is greater. The pirapitinga makes two migrations during the year, one \n\nat the beginning of the flood, between November and February, for spawning and another at \n\nthe beginning of the ebb, between June and October, when the species leaves the flooded forest \n\nto the headwaters of rivers (HERN\u00c1NDEZ, 1994; SANTOS; FERREIRA; ZUANON, 2006). \n\nThe cultivation of P. brachypomus in Brazil reached a production of approximately 10 \n\nthousand tons among the pure native species (MPA, 2013a). \n\nIn addition to being widely used in fishing, pirapitinga has been used in fish farming at \n\ncrossing with tambaqui, generating the hybrid tambatinga that has desirable characteristics for \n\nmanagement (SANTOS; FERREIRA; ZUANON, 2006). In addition, the species presents great \n\nimportance in the gastronomy and the commercial fishing as ornamental fish (SOBRINHO et \n\nal., 1984). \n\nIn the aquaculture production of freshwater, tambaqui and pirapitinga have aroused the \n\ninterest of fish producers from several Brazilian states, where tambaqui production exceeded \n\n54 thousand tons and pirapitinga reached 780 thousand tons in 2010 (MPA, 2012). \n\n \n\n1.3 Myxozoans  \n\nIchthyofauna may to host a diversity of organisms and, with this, affect the development \n\nof host species (EIRAS, 2004; FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006). Studies involving parasitic \n\ninfections in fish have intensified in recent years due to the morbidity and mortality that these \n\npathogens can cause in fish from fish farms and the natural environment (FEIST; \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\nLONGSHAW, 2006) and the aquatic environment facilitates the penetration of these pathogens \n\n(EIRAS, 1994). Fish breeding systems are more prone to infections due to the high density and \n\nhandling where disease outbreaks are most likely to occur. Thus, the mass production of \n\ncultured fish is always accompanied by pathogens (R\u00dcCKERT et al., 2008). Among the fish \n\npathogens, stand out the parasites of the phylum Cnidaria, the myxozoans. \n\nMyxozoans are common and occasionally highly problematic parasites of fish \n\n(OKAMURA; GRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, 2015). These parasites are multicellular, spore \n\nforming and which have tissue tropism and host specificity (B\u00c9K\u00c9SI; SZ\u00c9KELY; MOLN\u00c1R, \n\n2002; ATKINSON, 2011). They are formed by the junction of two to seven valves in the form \n\nof myxospores, which are the resistant forms of the parasite. They present polar capsules, \n\ncontaining a polar filament in spiral form with function of fixation in the host. Inside the \n\nmyxospore are also sporoplasm with amoeboid forms, which are infecting cells for the new \n\nhost. These parasites develop in plasmodia that may or may not cause tissue compression and \n\nan inflammatory response of the host (EIRAS, 1994; FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006). \n\nApproximately 2,400 species are known, distributed in 63 genera (FIALA; \n\nBARTO\u0160OV\u00c1-SOJKOV\u00c1; WHIPPS, 2015), with the most prominent genera being \n\nHenneguya Th\u00e9lohan, 1892 and Myxobolus B\u00fctschli, 1882. The majority of species are not \n\npathogenic, however, some cause significant damages to their hosts in the natural environment \n\nand/or breeding systems (FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006). \n\nMyxobolus cerebralis Hofer, 1903 is one of the most studied species, with great impact \n\non mortality of salmonids and wide distribution, causing a disease called \"whirling disease\" \n\n(EL-WELL et al., 2009). The parasite develops cysts in the cartilaginous tissue, from which it \n\nfeeds, causing inflammation and damage to the adjacent central nervous system causing the fish \n\nto have a rotating behavior (GILBERT; GRANATH, 2003). In the rocky Mountain region, in \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nthe United States, M. cerebralis was identified as responsible for the decline in population of \n\nrainbow trout also in a natural environment (ALLEN; BERGERSEN, 2002). \n\nIn addition to M. cerebralis, several other species of myxosporeans are reported to cause \n\nsignificant damage to their hosts, such as Kudoa thyrsites Whipps and Kent, 2006, which cause, \n\npostmortem, muscle liquefaction in several species of marine fish, leading to significant \n\neconomic losses to commercial fishing (WHIPPS; KENT, 2006).  Ceratonova shasta (syn. \n\nCeratomyxa shasta) causes enteronecrosis and is a common parasite in salmonids from North \n\nAmerican responsible for high mortality rates in juvenile salmon in the states of California and \n\nOregon (ATKINSON; BARTHOLOMEW, 2010). Henneguya ictaluri Pote, Hanson and \n\nShivaji, 2000 causes proliferative disease of the gills in catfish from breeding systems in the \n\nSouth of the United States (GRIFFIN et al., 2008). Henneguya pseudoplatystoma cause \n\nstretching and deformation of the filament and lamella structure in catfish in the South \n\nAmerican (NALDONI et al., 2009). The plasmodial development of Myxobolus hilarii in the \n\nrenal tubules of Brycon hilarii from fish farm, causes compression and deformation of adjacent \n\ntissues and destruction of renal tubule cells (CAPODIFOGLIO et al., 2016). \n\n \n\n1.4 Life cycle \n\nFor the first time, Wolf and Markiw, 1984, elucidated the life cycle of M. cerebralis in \n\na revolutionary study that changed the understanding of the biology of the myxosporids, \n\ndemonstrating that the species presented an indirect life cycle, involving a myxospore stage in \n\nvertebrate hosts and an actinospore stage that developed in invertebrate hosts. \n\nThe life cycle of the myxozoans, in general, involves two host which typically are \n\ninvertebrates and vertebrates, as definitive and intermediate hosts, respectively. They utilise \n\nannelids as definitive hosts and, in addition to fish, amphibians, reptiles and homeotherms are \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\nused as intermediate hosts of myxosporeans (OKAMURA; GRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, \n\n2015). \n\nIn the species in which the life cycle was studied, such as M. cerebralis, in the annelid \n\nphase it is initiated by the infection of these by myxospores. These myxospores are ingested by \n\nthe annelid (usually an oligochaete), and when in contact with the intestinal epithelium, releases \n\nthe polar filaments for anchorage of the parasite in the new host. At this time, the valves open \n\nand myxospores amoeboid sporoplasm is released, penetrating between the epithelial cells of \n\nthe intestine. The binucleated sporoplasm undergoes several nuclear divisions and this process \n\nresults in the formation of actinospores, which when released from the intestinal epithelial cells \n\nof annelids, which enter the aquatic environment together with the feces and serve as a source \n\nof infection for the fish. Free actinospores in water are infective to the intermediate host (usually \n\nfish), which in contact with the vertebrate host extrude the polar filaments, anchoring in the \n\nnew host. Then, the sporoplasm is released from the actinospore and penetrates the host through \n\nthe gills, skin, buccal cavity and also, intestinal. After penetration, the sporoplasm wall \n\ndissolves and the infecting cells invade adjacent tissues. The parasite reaches the target tissue, \n\nby circulation or intercellular migration, where occurs the development of the plasmodium and \n\nsporogony process, characteristic for each species, where are formed myxospores with distinct \n\nmorphology of the actinospores (FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006).  \n\n \n\n1.5 Taxonomy of myxosporean species \n\nDue to importance of myxosporeans parasites, many studies have been developed by \n\nscientists in natural environments and aquacultures for the purpose of to describe new species, \n\nand to understand hosts\u2013myxosporeans life cycles, morphology, hosts infection sites and \n\nphylogenetic position (ALAMA-BERMEJO; RAGA; HOLZER, 2011; AZEVEDO et al., 2014; \n\nROCHA et al., 2015). \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\nThe tradicional taxonomic identification of the myxosporeans is based on \n\nmorphological parameters and developmental stages of the myxospores and of the plasmodia, \n\nas well as the specificity to the host and the tissue that infect have been widely used. For a long \n\ntime, studies of identification of news myxosporean species have used only morphologic \n\nmethods (LOM; ARTHUR, 1989; OKAMURA; GRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, 2015). Most \n\nmyxozoan species have a specificity to single host species or family, being used as important \n\ncharacter for distinguishing myxosporean species (MOLN\u00c1R, 1994). In additional, other \n\ncharacters such as tissue specificity, traits of developmental stages data can be clear \n\nincorporated to improve classification (OKAMURA; GHRUL, 2015). \n\nHowever, taxonomic classification based only in morphological analyses has its \n\nlimitations due the high level of natural morphological and morphometric variation in spores \n\nand, sometimes, to present debatable results due the similarity between myxospores, hampering \n\nthe taxonomic classification (ATKINSON et al., 2015).  \n\nThus, Kent et al. (2001); Zhao et al. (2008); Fiala et al. (2015) proposed that the \n\nutilization of morphological and molecular techniques is fundamental and complementary for \n\nidentification of news species and also to avoid taxonomic confusion in myxosporeans. \n\nIn South America, our group of the Laboratory of Immunology of Parasites (LIP), of \n\nthe University of S\u00e3o Paulo was the first to associate morphological and molecular data for \n\nmyxosporean species with the description of Myxobolus cordeiroi Adriano, Arana, Alves, \n\nSilva, Ceccarelli, Henrique-Silva and Maia, 2009 parasite of Zungaro jahu from Brazilian \n\nPantanal. After this, many species have been described based on morphological and molecular \n\ndata in economically important fish (AGUIAR; ADRIANO; MATHEWS, 2017; AZEVEDO et \n\nal., 2010; CAPODIFOGLIO et al., 2016; CARRIERO et al., 2013; MATHEWS; MAIA; \n\nADRIANO, 2016; MILANIN et al., 2010; MOREIRA et al., 2014; NALDONI et al., 2009; \n\n2011; ROCHA et al., 2014; VELASCO et al., 2016; ZATTI et al., 2015; 2018).  \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\nApproximately 120 myxosporean species were described in the South American \n\nfreshwater and marine environments (ADRIANO; OLIVEIRA, 2019). And still there are many \n\nundescribed myxosporean species (ZATTI et al., 2018), as well diversity of other myxozoans \n\nis underestimated (ATKINSON et al., 2015). \n\n \n\n1.6 Molecular markers for identification of myxosporeans \n\nRecent molecular studies with myxosporeans have as main approach the amplification \n\nof the gene responsible for the coding of the small subunit Deoxyribonucleic Acid (ssrDNA) \n\n(MOLN\u00c1R et al., 2002; FERGUSON et al., 2008; FIALA, 2006; MILANIN et al., 2010; \n\nNALDONI et al., 2011; CARRIERO, 2011). This approach has been shown to be efficient for \n\nidentifying and separating phylogenetically distant species, but it is not indicated to evaluate \n\nthe occurrence of intraspecific variations or between phylogenetically closely related species. \n\nThrough morphologic and morphometric data, and sites of infection was observed that \n\nspecies of  Myxobolus and Henneguya genera that infect Piaractus corruscans from the \n\nPantanal are also found infecting Piaractus reticulatum from the same environment \n\n(CARRIERO, 2011). These data were corroborated by the molecular analyses, from the partial \n\nsequence of the ssrDNA (CARRIERO, 2011; ADRIANO et al., 2012). Nevertheless, \n\nalignments of sequences showed variations, even if small, between samples of the same parasite \n\nspecies found in P. corruscans compared with samples from P. reticulatum. \n\nIn 2003, Herbet et al. proposed a system of molecular identification, a universal \n\n\"bioidentifier\", for the discrimination of all living species on the planet. This system was called \n\nDNA Barcodes and consists of the amplification of the mitochondrial Cytochrome C Oxidase \n\nI (COI) gene, has a greater number of phylogenetically informative sites in relation to other \n\nmitochondrial genes (KNOWLTON; WEIGT, 1998). \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nTakeuchi et al. (2015), sequenced by the first time the mitochondrial genome of \n\nmyxosporeans and observed that Kudoa mitochondrial genome are divergent from other \n\nmetazoans, suggesting that the mitochondrial of Myxozoa is, in general, potentially divergent. \n\n \n\n1.7 Mitochondrial organelles of myxosporeans \n\nMyxosporeans were first reported in 1825 infecting Coregonus fera from Lake Geneva \n\nas threats for fish due to cysts proliferation in the musculature of the host (JURINE,1825). Since \n\nthen, these parasites have become aim of interest of researchers (MLADINEO et al., 2010) and \n\nthe increasing knowledge of new species, as well other studies has allowed to understading \n\nbetter the morphology, parasite-host relationship, evolution and biology of the myxosporeans \n\n(ALAMA-BERMEJO et al., 2011; OKAMURA et al., 2015). \n\nThe technological advances of transmission electron microscopy allowed new insights \n\non functional biology and cytological features of myxosporeans (OKAMURA et al., 2015). \n\nSome these studies documented developmental stages and while other focused on features of \n\nthe constituents such as pinocytotic vesicles, microvilli, Golgi complexes and mitochondria \n\n(LOM; DYKOV\u00c1, 1992). \n\nMitochondria are cytoplasmatic organelles existing in practically all types of eukaryotic \n\ncells vegetables and animals (NICHOLLS; FERGUSON, 2002), in number proportional to the \n\nmetabolic activity of each one, being then variable in the different cells, and, also, it is the \n\nprimary source of hightly energetic compost in the cell (BEAL, 2005; BRAND; NICHOLLS, \n\n2011).   \n\nIn myxosporeans, mitochondria are presents in greater numbers in the periphery of \n\nplasmodia which high levels of pinocytotic activity (FEIST et al., 2015). Transformations of \n\nmitochondrial organelles are associated with not yet understood changes in metabolic activity \n\nand ion traffic at different stages of development of the myxosporeans and, in addition, there is \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\na great variability in the density of mitochondrial matrix and in the shape of cristae (LOM; \n\nDYKOV\u00c1, 1996). Just like the process sporogenesis also appears to follow a pattern observed \n\nin many myxosporean species, with the early stages of myxospore formation in the plasmodial \n\nperiphery and mature myxospores located in the central part of the plasmodia (CURRENT et \n\nal., 1979; CASAL et al., 2002; ADRIANO et al., 2006).  \n\nTypically, myxospores are physiologically inactive, usually relatively immobile and \n\nrigid (FEIST et al., 2015) and are more resistant which malacospores and actinospores, being \n\nable to withstand extremes in temperature, desiccation and extended dormancy (HALLET; \n\nBARTHOLOMEW, 2012). \n\nTo understand the role of mitochondria in Kudoa myxospores, Takeuchi et al. (2015) \n\nobserved in vivo the aerobic respiration, metabolism, and structure of the mitochondria, besides \n\nof the mitochondrial genome. The authors found eight proteins involved in the oxidative \n\nphosphorylation and, the aerobic respiration was observed, with fluorescent dye which detects \n\nproton gradients in the mitochondria, next to the polar capsules, suggesting that the aerobic \n\nrespiration must to occur therein and is necessary to measure the acvitiy of each complex of \n\noxidative phosphorylation for understading of the cellular respiration in myxosporeans. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                            HYPOTHESES \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n2 HYPOTHESES \n\n- There is a diversity of myxosporean species infecting Colossoma macropomum and \n\nPiaractus brachypomus from the Amazon basin. \n\n- COI gene can be a good molecular marker for the identification of new species. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                                                                                    OBJECTIVES \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\n3 OBJECTIVES \n\n \n\n3.1 General Objective \n\nIdentify and describe the species of myxosporeans found infecting tambaqui (C. \n\nmacropomum) and pirapitinga (P. brachypomus) from the Amazon basin. \n\n \n\n3.2 Specifics Objectives \n\n3.2.1 Carry out taxonomic studies of myxosporean parasites of tambaqui (C. \n\nmacropomum) and pirapitinga (P. brachypomus), through morphological and molecular, by \n\nsequencing the ssrDNA, data; \n\n3.2.2 Evaluate the phylogenetic relationship of parasites involved in this study in \n\nrelation to other myxosporeans described in Brazil and in the world; \n\n3.2.3 Sequence the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome C Oxidase I of myxosporeans in \n\nC. macropomum and P. brachypomus. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n                                                                                        MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\n4 MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\n4.1 General Methodology \n\nThis project was linked to the project \u201cSystematics and parasite-host interaction of \n\nparasites of Myxozoa subphylum in fish of economic importance of the Amazon Basin\u201d of the \n\nProf. Dr. Edson Aparecido Adriano, process FAPESP: 2013/21374-6 and was developed in the \n\nlaboratory of Immunology of Parasites (LIP), of the Department of Veterinary Medicine,  of \n\nthe Faculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo, FZEA/USP, \n\nPirassununga \u2013 SP, in partnership with Department of Ecology and Evolution Biology, Federal \n\nUniversity of S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 UNIFESP, Campus Diadema \u2013 SP; Department of Biochemistry and \n\nCell Morphology of the Institute of Biology IB/UNICAMP, Campinas, SP. \n\n4.1.1 Samples collection \n\nThe collections were performed in the Amazon basin, in the Tapaj\u00f3s and Solim\u00f5es \n\nrivers, Santar\u00e9m, PA and Manacapuru, AM, respectively (Figures 1 A \u2013 B). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\nFigure 1.

Schematic representation of the localization of primers for amplification and \n\nsequencing of ssrDNA. \n\n \nSource: own authorship. \n\n \n\nAll PCR products were subjected to 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in TAE buffer \n\n(EDTA Tris-Acetate: Tris 40 mM, Acetic Acid 20 mM, EDTA 1 mM), stained with Sybr Safe \n\nDNA gel stain (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA) and analyzed in Light Emitting \n\nDiode (LED) transilluminator (Kasvi, Paran\u00e1, Brazil). The size of the amplified fragments was \n\nestimated by comparison to the standard 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, \n\nCalifornia, USA). \n\n The PCR products were then purified using the QIAquick PCR kit (Qiagen Inc., \n\nCalifornia, USA), according to the manufacturer's specifications. The purified product was \n\nquantified in 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and compared to Low DNA Mass (Thermo \n\nScientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA). \n\n Sequencing \n\nThe sequencing of the purified PCR products was performed with primers specific for \n\neach gene (Table 1), in the ABI 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, \n\n\n\n47 \n \n\nUSA), using the BigDye\u00ae Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., \n\nCalifornia, USA). \n\n The obtained sequences were then visualized, edited and aligned in the program BioEdit \n\n7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999) using the algorithm ClustalW (THOMPSON, 1994), forming a \n\nconsensus sequence for each sample. Each consensus sequence was submitted to BLASTn \n\n(ALTSCHUL et al., 1990) analysis for the search for similarity in the GenBank database \n\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). \n\n 4.1.5 Phylogenetic analyses \n\n For the phylogenetic analyses, alignments were performed with sequences of \n\nmyxosporeans deposited in GenBank database by the algorithm ClustalW (THOMPSON et al., \n\n1994) coupled to the program BioEdit 7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999).  \n\n The maximum likelihood method was performed by the PhyML 3.0 program \n\n(GUINDON et al., 2010), with automatic model selection by Smart Model Selection (SMS) and \n\nbootstrap value of 1000 repetitions. The resulting trees were visualized in the FigTree 1.3.1 \n\nprogram (RAMBAUT, 2008) and edited with Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, \n\nUSA). \n\n The p-distance analysis was performed by the MEGA 7.0 software (KUMAR; \n\nSTECHER; TAMURA, 2016) to compare the genetic differences among the species studied \n\nwith other myxosporeans species of the GenBank database. \n\n Host fish data, such as family and/or order, were obtained from the FishBase website \n\n(FROESE; PAULY, 2018). \n\n \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n4.2 Supplementary Methodology \n\nDue to the availability of material and the willingness to enrich the data of this study, \n\nhistological and electron microscopy analyses were performed for some samples. Microscopy \n\nfluorescence was perfomed to observe the behavior in vivo of mitochondria in Henneguya spp. \n\n4.2.1 Histologic analyses \n\nFor histologic analyses, fragments containing plasmodia were fixed in buffered 10% \n\nformalin for 24h and placed in paraffin. Sections of 4 \u00b5m thickness were then stained with \n\nhematoxylin-eosin and analyzed in Leica DM 1000 Microscope coupled with Leica EC3 \n\ncamera and LAS EZ image capture software. \n\n4.2.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy analyses \n\nFor transmission electron microscopy, small fragments of infected tissue were fixed in \n\n2.5% glutaraldehyde diluted in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate (pH 7.4) for 12h, washed in glucose-\n\nsaline solution for 2h and fixed in OsO4 for 4h. After, these samples were dehydrated in \n\nincreasing concentrations of acetone and embedded in Embed 812 resin. Uranyl acetate citrate \n\nwas used to treat ultrathin sections that, posteriorly, were examined in a LEO 906 transmission \n\nelectron microscope operating at 60 kV (UNICAMP). \n\n4.2.3 Fluorescence Microscopy analyses \n\n Live myxospores were collected of fins of Astyanax altiparanae in a fish farm and kept \n\nin microtube containing PBS. Spores were centrifuged and stained with MitoTracker Orange\u00ae \n\n(Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA) and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole \n\ndihydrochloride (DAPI) (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA) and visualized in \n\ninverted microscope Zeiss AxioVert A1 coupled with photographic camera Axio Can 503. \n\n The results of this work are divided in four chapters, which generated two articles. The \n\nfirst one already published and the second sent for publication. The third chapter refers to results \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nobtained by undergraduated Caroline Munhoz Meira. The fourth chapter refers to studies of the \n\nCOI gene and fluorescence microscopy in myxosporeans.  \n\n Specific methodologies are described in each chapter. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nREFERENCE \n\nALAMA\u2013BERMEJO, G.; RAGA, J.

THE RESOLUTION OF THE TAXONOMIC DILEMMA OF Myxobolus \n\ncolossomatis AND DESCRIPTION OF TWO NOVEL MYXOSPOREANS SPECIES OF \n\nColossoma macropomum FROM THE AMAZON BASIN \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThis study presents morphologic, molecular and phylogenetic data about two new species of \n\nthe genus Myxobolus and of the previously described Myxobolus colossomatis, all which are \n\nfound infecting the Colossoma macropomum, a fish whose natural habitat is the Amazon Basin \n\nof Brazil, from where the specimens for this study were caught. A total of 51 C. macropomum \n\nspecimens were examined between October of 2014 and January of 2016. Plasmodia of the \n\nmyxosporeans were found infecting several organs: Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 2 \n\nwere respectively found in the inner face of the operculum and in the wall external surface of \n\nthe stomach, intestine and gill arch. Myxobolus n. sp. 1 were 9.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5m in length, 7.0 \u00b1 0.3 \n\n\u00b5m in width and 5.0\u00b10.3 \u00b5m in thickness of the myxospore. Myxobolus n. sp. 2 measured 19.1 \n\n\u00b1 0.4 \u00b5m in length, 9.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m in width and 8.3\u00b10.4 \u00b5m in thickness. The polar capsules, \n\nwhich were elongated, showed 4.3 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5m in length and 1.9 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m in width for Myxobolus \n\nn. sp. 1 and 10.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m in length and 2.5 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m in width for Myxobolus n. sp. 2. Myxobolus \n\ncolossomatis had two myxospores morphotypes: 1) Ellipsoidal myxospores measuring 11.6 \u00b1 \n\n0.4 \u00b5m in length and 7.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m in width. Their elongated polar capsules measured 5.6 \u00b1 0.2 \n\n\u00b5m in length and 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m in width; 2) Oval myxospores measuring 10.4 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m in length \n\nand 7.7 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m in width. Their polar capsules were 5.4 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m in length and 2.4 \u00b1 0.0 \u00b5m \n\nin width. The number of coils of the polar filament was 7-8 coils. The molecular comparison of \n\nssrDNA showed a genetic divergence of 10.3% between Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and M. \n\ncolossomatis, 22.4% between Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 2, and 23.2% between \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 2 and M. colossomatis. Myxobolus cf. colossomatis, a parasite of Piaractus \n\n\n\n61 \n \n\nmesopotamicus, showed 11.1% of genetic divergence to M. colossomatis, demonstrating them \n\nto be a distinct species. Phylogenetic analysis, based on sequences of the ssrDNA, showed the \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 1 to be a sister species of M. colossomatis, and it also showed Myxobolus n. \n\nsp. 2 to be a sister branch in the lineage composed by Myxobolus cf. cuneus and Henneguya \n\npellucida. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Myxobolus; Myxobolus colossomatis; ssrDNA sequencing; phylogeny; prevalence. \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\n Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1816, is a serrasalmid fish commonly known in Brazil \n\nas tambaqui. It is considered the second largest scaled fish from Amazon River Basin, and in \n\nits natural environment it may reach up to 100 cm long and weigh 30 kg (NAKATANI et al., \n\n2001). Tambaqui is the most cultivated species in the Brazilian Amazon (GOMES et al., 2010; \n\nLOPERA-BARRERO et al., 2011) and one of the most important species in Brazilian \n\naquaculture. Almost 60.000t were marketed in 2010, with 4.200t caught by fishing and 54.300t \n\nharvested from fish farms (MPA, 2012). Colossoma macropomum is also important when it is \n\ncrossbred in fish farms with other serrasalmids species, such as the Piaractus mesopotamicus \n\nHolmberg, 1887, which results in a hybrid called tambacu, or with the Piaractus brachypomus \n\nCuvier, 1818, which results in the hybrid tambatinga. These produced around 21.600t and \n\n5.000t respectively in 2010 (MPA, 2012).  \n\n Due to its economic importance as one of the most important species of the amazonic \n\nicthyofauna (GOULDING; CARVALHO, 1982), C. macropomum has been targeted for the \n\nstudy of several parasitic infections, including those of the myxosporeans. Myxosporea is a \n\nmorphologically and biologically diverse group of parasite cnidarians that cause diseases and \n\nthreaten fish in their natural habitats and in fish farms in various parts of the world. They are \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nalso responsible for high mortality rates in some species and are associated with ecological and \n\neconomic impacts (LOM; DYKOV\u00c1, 2006; ELWELL et al., 2009; FIALA; BARTO\u0160OV\u00c1, \n\n2010). Despite the importance of C. macropomum, only Myxobolus colossomatis Moln\u00e1r and \n\nB\u00e9k\u00e9si, 1993 and Ceratomyxa vermiformis Adriano and Okamura, 2017 have so far been \n\ndescribed in this iconic Amazon fish. In this study, however, morphologic and small subunit \n\nribosomal DNA (ssrDNA) sequencing data were obtained from M. colossomatis and of two \n\nnew Myxobolus B\u00fctschli, 1882 species found parasitizing tambaqui in the Amazon River Basin, \n\nBrazil, and a phylogenetic analysis is also provided. \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nSpecimens of C. macropomum were caught (SISBIO n\u00ba 44268-4 and SisGen n\u00ba \n\nA33CB83) in the Tapaj\u00f3s River in the municipality of Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1 State (N = 35) and also \n\nin the Solim\u00f5es River in the municipality of Manacapuru, Amaz\u00f4nia State (N = 16), both in the \n\nBrazilian Amazon. The fish were caught using nets and/or hooks and taken alive to a field \n\nlaboratory near their point of collection. Before the examination, the fish were euthanized with \n\nspinal transection methodology approved by the ethics research committee of the University de \n\nS\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Process USP 14.1.391.74.9 (ATTACHMENT B) measured, necropsied and \n\nexamined for myxosporeans.  \n\n \n\n2.1 Morphological analyses \n\nMyxosporean plasmodia were carefully separated from the host tissue and individually \n\nruptured in glass slides. A total of 30 mature myxospores were analyzed in a light microscope, \n\nphotographed and measured according Lom and Arthur (1989). The dimensions of the \n\nmyxospores are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation in \u00b5m. These slides were then fixed \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\nwith methanol and stained with Giemsa to be deposited in the collection of the Ad\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 \n\nCardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. \n\n \n\n2.2 Molecular analyses \n\nSsrDNA analyses were performed in the samples of myxospores and taxonomic and \n\nphylogenetic studies were initiated. The ?-tropomyosin gene of the host were sequenced from \n\nhost tissue aiming the correct host identification of the fish.  \n\nThe DNA of each sample was extracted separately with DNeasy\u00ae Blood &amp; Tissue kit \n\n(Qiagen Inc., California, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR reactions were \n\nperformed with a final volume of 25 \u00b5L containing 10 - 50 ng of genomic DNA, DreamTaq \n\n12.5 \u00b5L of 2 \u00d7 PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA), 0.2 \u00b5M of \n\neach specific primer and nuclease free water (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA). \n\nFor ssrDNA amplification, primer pairs ERIB1 (BARTA et al., 1997) with ACT1R (HALLET; \n\nDIAMANT, 2001) and TEDF (CAPODIFOGLIO et al., 2015) with ERIB10 (BARTA et al., \n\n1997) were used. The amplifications of the ?-tropomyosin gene were performed using the \n\nprimer pair TROPF and TROPR (FRIESEN et al., 1999) in accordance with Hashimoto et al. \n\n(2011), followed by modifications. A ProFlex PCR Systems thermocycler (Applied \n\nBiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA) was utilized for amplification of the genes with a program \n\nas follows: ssrDNA (initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles: 95\u00b0C for 60 s, 60\u00b0C \n\nfor 60 s and 72\u00b0C for 90 s; final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes), ?-tropomyosin (35 cycles: \n\n95\u00b0C for 30 s, 64\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 10 s). All PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% \n\nagarose gel electrophoresis in a TAE buffer (Tris\u2013Acetate EDTA, Tris 40 mM, Acetic Acid 20 \n\nmM, EDTA 1 mM), stained with Sybr Safe DNA gel stain (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, \n\nCalifornia, USA), and analyzed in a LED transilluminator (Kasvi, Paran\u00e1, Brazil). The sizes of \n\nthe amplified fragments were estimated by comparison with the 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\n(Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA). The PCR products were purified using the \n\nQIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA) and sequenced using the same \n\nprimer pairs used in the reaction, as well as the additional primers for sequencing of ssrDNA: \n\nBOBF 5'-TGTTACAGCATGGAACGAAC-3' (Present study); MC5 and MC3 (MOLN\u00c1R et \n\nal., 2002), in order to overlap the fragments obtained. Sequencing of all samples was performed \n\nusing the BigDye\u00ae Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., \n\nCalifornia, USA) and an ABI 3730 DNA sequencing analyzer (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., \n\nCalifornia, USA).  \n\nThe DNA sequences obtained were visualized and assembled using BioEdit 7.1.3.0 \n\n(HALL, 1999) software and compared with other myxozoans sequences available in the NCBI \n\ndatabase using BLASTn (ALTSCHUL et al., 1997) for confirmation of myxozoans and C. \n\nmacropomum DNA.  \n\n \n\n2.3 Phylogenetic analysis \n\nThe alignment was performed using the closest myxozoans sequences to each one of the \n\nspecies here studied, based on GenBank data by BLASTn. The sequences of the ssrDNA of \n\nmyxosporeans were obtained from the NCBI database, and a total of 31 sequences of \n\nHenneguya species, 45 of Myxobolus species and one of Thelohanellus Kudo, 1933 species \n\nwere inserted in the analysis. Ceratomyxa amazonensis Mathews, Naldoni, Maia and Adriano, \n\n2016 and Ceratomyxa vermiformis Adriano and Okamura, 2017 were chosen as the outgroup. \n\nAll sequences were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm (THOMPSON et al., 1994) by \n\nsoftware BioEdit 7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999).  \n\nPhylogenetic analysis was conducted using maximum likelihood method in PhyML \n\nsoftware (GUINDON et al. 2010), with NNI search, automatic model selection by SMS, under \n\na GTR + G + I substitution model (with four categories), equilibrium frequencies optimized, \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\ntransition/transversion ratio estimated, proportion of in-variable sites estimated (0.246) and \n\ngamma shape parameter estimated (0.533). Bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) was employed \n\nto assess the relative robustness of the tree branches.  \n\nThe phylogenetic tree was viewed using FigTree v1.3.1 (RAMBAUT, 2008) and edited \n\nwith Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, USA). The pairwise method, with the p-\n\ndistance model (KUMAR; STECHER; TAMURA, 2016), was carried out in the MEGA 7.0 \n\nsoftware to compare the genetic differences of the ssrDNA sequences among the focus species \n\nof this study with Myxobolus spp. of other serrasalmids fish. The data of the host fishes, as \n\nfamily and/or order, were obtained from FishBase web site (FROESE; PAULY, 2017). \n\n \n\n2.4. Statistical analysis \n\nThe G test (with Williams correction) was performed with the BioEstat 5.0 (AYRES et \n\nal., 2000); it had a level of significance set at p &lt;0.05 and was used to compare if there were \n\nany significant differences of the prevalence among the Myxobolus species and the places of \n\nstudy. \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\n \n\nEpidemiologic data \n\nIn addition to the morphological identification of all the hosts, this study also provided \n\nthe identification of three tambaqui specimens by the sequencing of ?-tropomyosin and \n\ncomparison with GenBank data by BLASTn.  \n\nThree Myxobolus species were found infecting C. macropomum specimens in this study. \n\nOf the total of 51 tambaqui sampled, 35 (68.6%) had infections by at least one of these \n\nMyxobolus species. Myxobolus colossomatis was observed in 6.2% (1/16) of the fish examined \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nin Amazonas State and in 17.1% (6/35) in the Par\u00e1 State. These prevalence did not differ \n\nsignificantly (G test = 1.14, df = 1). The parasite was found in several organs, such as the fin, \n\npyloric cecum, gill arch and abdominal cavity. Two of the three Myxobolus species were \n\nunknown myxosporeans, and are below described: Myxobolus n. sp. 1 was found infecting the \n\ninner surface of the operculum, with prevalence of 6.2% (1/16) in Amazonas State and 5.7% \n\n(2/35) in Par\u00e1 State, and these prevalence did not differ significantly between (G test = 0.004, \n\ndf = 1); Myxobolus n. sp. 2 was observed parasitizing the external wall of the stomach, intestine \n\nand epithelium of the gill arch. The prevalence was of 8.5% (3/35) in Par\u00e1 State and this species \n\nwas not found in Amazonas State. The comparison of the total prevalence among each one of \n\nthe three Myxobolus species studied showed that there were not significant differences (G test \n\n= 2.76, df = 2). \n\n \n\n  Taxonomic data \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 1 (Figures 5-6, A) \n\nDescription: plasmodia white and ~ 0.1 mm were found in the inner surface of the \n\noperculum of C. macropomum. Mature myxospores were ellipsoid in frontal view (Figure 5A), \n\nmeasuring 9.6 \u00b1 0.4 (9.1 to 10.8) \u00b5m in length, 7.0 \u00b1 0.3 (6.5 to 7.6) \u00b5m in width and biconvex \n\nin lateral view, with 5.0 \u00b1 0.3 (4.6 to 5.5) \u00b5m in thickness and valves symmetric. The polar \n\ncapsules elongated and were equal in size, measuring 4.3 \u00b1 0.4 (3.3 to 5.0) \u00b5m in length and \n\n1.9 \u00b1 0.1 (1.6 to 2.2) \u00b5m in width, and occupying half of the spore body length (Figure 5A).

Initially, the comparison was done with \n\nparasite species of C. macropomum. Myxobolus n. sp. 1 differs in some morphological and \n\nmorphometric aspect as length and width of the body, length and width of the polar capsules \n\nand thickness in comparison to Myxobolus n. sp. 2 and M. colossomatis (Table 3). Of the species \n\nfound infecting other fishes of the Serrasalmidae family, Myxobolus n. sp. 1 presented \n\nmeasurements closest with M. cf. colossomatis, a parasite of Piaractus mesopotamicus, to \n\nwhich this new species was similar in length and width of the polar capsules (respectively: \n\n4.3/1.9 for Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and 4.4/1.8 for M. cf. colossomatis), but the body shape differed \n\nin the anterior extremity, once Myxobolus n. sp. 1 presented rounded anterior end and M. cf. \n\ncolossomatis exhibited tapered anterior end. In comparing the Myxobolus with parasite species \n\nof other hosts, Myxobolus n. sp. 1 differed in morphometric/morphological features in at least \n\none of the following properties: the size and/or shape of the plasmodia and myxospores, the \n\nnumber of polar tubules coils, the site of infection, and region of occurrence (EIRAS 2002; \n\nEIRAS; ADRIANO 2012). \n\nThe ssrDNA sequencing of Myxobolus n. sp. 1 resulted in a partial sequence of 1956 \n\nbp, which did not match with any myxosporeans sequences available in GenBank database. \n\nAnalysis of the genetic similarity of the myxosporean parasites of serrassalmid fish showed that \n\nthe closest species to Myxobolus n. sp. 1 was Myxobolus colossomatis (Present study) with a \n\n10.3% of difference (Table 4). Thus, based on morphological and molecular data, Myxobolus \n\nn. sp. 1 is proposed to be a new taxon.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 2 (Figures 5-6, B) \n\nDescription: White plasmodia measuring ~ 0.2 mm were found in the external wall of \n\nthe stomach, intestine and gill arch of C. macropomum. Mature myxospores were elongated \n\n(Figure 5B), measuring 19.1 \u00b1 0.4 (18.0 to 20.0) \u00b5m in length, 9.4\u00b10.3 (8.6 to 10.4) \u00b5m in \n\nwidth, biconvex in lateral view, with 8.3 \u00b1 0.4 (7.6 to 8.9) \u00b5m in thickness. Polar capsules \n\nelongated with equal size, measuring 10.5 \u00b1 0.2 (9.7 to 11.1) \u00b5m in length and 2.5 \u00b1 0.1 (2.1 to \n\n2.8) \u00b5m in width, occupied a little more than half the body of the myxospores. Polar tubules \n\nwith 9 to 10 coils were arranged perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis of the polar capsule \n\n(Figure 5B, Table 3). \n\nType host: Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1816, Characiformes: Serrasalmidae. \n\nLocality: Tapaj\u00f3s River, municipality of Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1 State, Brazil. \n\nPrevalence: 3 of 51 (5.9%). \n\nSites of infection: The external wall of the stomach, intestine and gill arch. \n\nType of material: Slides with stained myxospores were deposited in the collections of \n\nthe Ad\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), \n\nBrazil (accession number ZUEC \u2013 MYX90). \n\nMolecular data: Partial sequence with 1945 bp of the ssrDNA were deposited in \n\nGenBank under the accession number MK032221. \n\nRemarks: Myxobolus n. sp. 2 was also compared with all species of Myxobolus that \n\ninfect freshwater fish of the South America and other continents (EIRAS et al., 2005, 2014). \n\nMyxobolus myleus Azevedo, Clemente, Casal, Matos, Alves, Al-Quraishy and Matos, 2012, a \n\nparasite also of the Amazon serrasalmid Myleus rubripinnis, presented similar dimensions of \n\nthe myxospores body length (19.3 for M. myleus and 19.1 for Myxobolus n. sp. 2), but differed \n\nin the body shape when viewed frontally; M. myleus exhibited a lightly-tapered anterior end \n\nand pear-shaped myxospores. Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the molecular \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\ncomparison between these two species, since the M. myleus description was based on only \n\nmorphological data. Myxobolus cf. cuneus (MILANIN et al., 2015), a parasite of hybrid \n\nserrasalmids, presented the same number of coils of the polar filaments [9-10] (Table 3), but \n\nthese two species differed in the morphology, since M. cf. cuneus presented a pyriform shape, \n\nwhile Myxobolus n. sp. 2 presented an ellipsoidal shape. Comparing Myxobolus species \n\nparasites of other hosts, this new species differed in morphometric/morphological features at \n\nleast in one of the properties, such as size and/or shape of the plasmodia and myxospores, \n\nnumber of polar tubules coils, site of infection and region of occurrence (EIRAS 2002; EIRAS; \n\nADRIANO 2012). The ssrDNA sequencing of Myxobolus n. sp. 2 resulted in a partial sequence \n\nof 1945 bp, which did not match to any myxosporean sequences available in GenBank database. \n\nIn the genetic similarity analysis of the myxosporeans parasites of serralmids fish Myxobolus \n\nn. sp. 2, the closest species was M. cf. cuneus with a 14.8% of difference (Table 4). The \n\nmorphological and molecular data support the creating of the new taxon.  \n\n \n\nMyxobolus colossomatis Moln\u00e1r and B\u00e9k\u00e9si, 1993 (Figures 5-6, C) \n\nMorphological characteristics:  White plasmodia, measuring ~ 0.1 mm and containing \n\ninnumerous mature and immature myxospores were found in different organs, such as pyloric \n\ncecum, skin and gill arch. The majority of the mature myxospores were ellipsoidal in frontal \n\nview (Figure 5C), measuring 11.6 \u00b1 0.4 (10.8 to 12.3) \u00b5m in length and 7.6 \u00b1 0.2 (7.2 to 8.1) \n\n\u00b5m in width. Polar capsules elongated and were of equal size, measuring 5.6 \u00b1 0.2 (5.0 to 5.9) \n\n\u00b5m of length and 2.5 \u00b1 0.2 (2.2 to 3.4) \u00b5m of width and occupying little more than half of the \n\nspore. A few myxospores had oval shape (with slightly narrower anterior region), measuring \n\n10.4 \u00b1 0.5 (9.6 to 10.8) \u00b5m in length, 7.7 \u00b1 0.3 (7.3 to 8.0) \u00b5m in width. The polar capsules \n\nwere elongated and with equal size, measuring 5.4 \u00b1 0.2 (5.1 to 5.7) \u00b5m in length and 2.4 \u00b1 0.0 \n\n(2.3 to 2.4) \u00b5m in width (Table 3). The polar tubules had 7 to 8 coils.  \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\nHost: Colossoma macropomum Cuvier, 1816, Characiformes: Serrasalmidae. \n\nLocalities of collection: Solim\u00f5es and Tapaj\u00f3s Rivers, municipality of Manacapuru, \n\nAmazonas State and Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1 State, respectively, Brazil. \n\nPrevalence: 7 of 51 (13.7%). \n\nSites of infection: Liver, spleen, pyloric cecum, fin, wall intestinal, digestive tract and \n\ngill arch. \n\nMaterial deposited: Slides with stained myxospores were deposited in the collections \n\nof the Ad\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas \n\n(UNICAMP), Brazil (accession number ZUEC \u2013 MYX 91). \n\nMolecular data: Partial sequence with 1936 bp of the ssrDNA were deposited in \n\nGenBank under the accession number MK032220.  \n\nRemarks:  The morphological and morphometric data of the Myxobolus species were \n\nfound parasitizing the pyloric cecum, skin and gill arch of C. colossomatis from the Amazon \n\nand concurred to those of the M. colossomatis originally described by Moln\u00e1r and B\u00e9k\u00e9si (1993) \n\n(Table 3). The ssrDNA sequencing of M. colossomatis performed in this study resulted in a \n\npartial sequence of 1936 bp, which did not match to any myxosporean sequences available in \n\nGenBank database or in the genetic similarity analysis. Considering parasite species of \n\nserrasalmids, Myxobolus n. sp. 1 was the closest related species to M. colossomatis, with 10.3% \n\nof difference (Table 4).  \n\n\n\n73 \n \n\n \n\nTable 3.

All these were found parasitizing C. macropomum in its natural habitat of \n\nthe Amazon Basin.  \n\nThe BLASTn search was conducted for each ssrDNA sequences obtained in this \n\nstudy to confirm amplification of myxozoan DNA, and no close matches to any \n\nmyxosporeans sequences available in GenBank. The p-distance analysis displayed \n\ngenetic divergences of 10.3% between Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and M. colossomatis, 22.4% \n\nbetween Myxobolus n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 2, and 23.2% between Myxobolus n. \n\nsp. 2 and M. colossomatis. This demonstrates that, in its natural habitat, C. macropomum \n\nharbors at least three distinct Myxobolus species, two of which were hitherto unknown. \n\nThe third parasite, M. colossomatis, had already been described by Moln\u00e1r and B\u00e9k\u00e9si \n\n(1993) to infect gills, fins, liver, heart, muscle and intestines of farmed specimens from \n\nCear\u00e1 State, in the Brazil\u2019s Northeast, although molecular data were not provided. Later, \n\nin a search for myxosporeans in farmed fish in S\u00e3o Paulo State in Brazil\u2019s Southeast, \n\nMartins et al. (1999) reported the occurrence M. colossomatis in the kidney of C. \n\nmacropomum, but these authors also identified the occurrence of this same parasite in \n\nkidney, liver, spleen and gallbladder of P. mesopotamicus, another serrasalmid fish \n\npopularly known as \u201cpacu\u201d, but whose the natural distribution is restricted to La Plata \n\nRiver Basin (LIMA et al. 2003). In studies carried out in the natural environment of \n\nBrazil\u2019s Pantanal wetlands (a part of the La Plata Basin) Adriano et al. (2002) and Campos \n\net al. (2008) also referred to a Myxobolus species and reported specimens of P. \n\nmesopotamicus as M. colossomatis; however, these authors, (MARTINS et al.,1999), did \n\nnot display morphometric and molecular data, thus leaving the real taxonomic position of \n\nthe studied parasites inconclusive. M\u00fcller et al. (2013), studying myxosporeans of farmed \n\nP. mesopotamicus, in S\u00e3o Paulo State, found gills infected by a Myxobolus sp. whose \n\nspores resembled that of the M. colossomatis described by Moln\u00e1r and B\u00e9k\u00e9si (1993), but \n\n\n\n77 \n \n\n \n\nin addition to morphometric data, the authors also performed ultrastructure and ssrDNA \n\nsequencing. Because the myxospores morphologic/morphometric data had very few \n\ndifferences to those of the original description of M. colossomatis (Table 1), and as there \n\nwas no molecular data for comparison, M\u00fcller et al. (2013) preferred to call it Myxobolus \n\ncf. colossomatis and wait for the availability of ssrDNA sequences of M. colossomatis \n\nobtained from the host type before defining it as the same species.  Notably, this study \n\nnow reveals a Myxobolus species found infecting pyloric cecum, skin and gill arch of \n\nspecimens of C. macropomum caught in its natural habitat (Amazon Basin), and in which \n\nmorphologic/morphometric data and biological traits have matched those reported by \n\nMoln\u00e1r and B\u00e9k\u00e9si (1993), in their original descriptions. Hence, this parasite has been \n\nidentified as M. colossomatis, and this has finally provided the ssrDNA sequence of this \n\nparasite from the host type, settling the taxonomic dilemma. The ssrDNA sequence of M. \n\ncolossomatis showed 11.1% of genetic divergence to that of M. cf. colossomatis found \n\nby M\u00fcller et al. (2013). It was discovered parasitizing farmed P. mesopotamicus in S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo State and thus demonstrates that this is an unnamed species waiting for a name. \n\nHowever, despite the fact that naturally C. macropomum and P. mesopotamicus \n\ninhabit distinct watersheds and fish farms, these two species are farmed throughout \n\nBrazil, and in some regions, they are crossed bred to obtain a hybrid fish called \n\n\u201ctambacu,\u201d which is largely accepted by consumers. It is therefore not possible to ensure \n\nthat in these conditions the Myxobolus species do not circulate between C. macropomum \n\nand P. mesopotamicus, or even between their hybrids. \n\nIn the phylogenetic analysis, the three Myxobolus parasite species of C. \n\nmacropomum were not monophyletic, with the strong likelihood that Myxobolus n. sp. 1 \n\nand M. colossomatis appear to be sister species in a lineage. Also, the M. cf. colossomatis, \n\nprovided by Muller et al. (2013). Myxobolus n. sp. 2 (albeit with low bootstrap support), \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\n \n\nappears in a sister branch of the lineage composed by Henneguya pellucida Adriano, \n\nArana and Cordeiro (2005) and Myxobolus cf. cuneus; both parasites are also of the \n\nserrassalmid P. mesopotamicus.  \n\nIn addition to the taxonomic and phylogenetic data above provided, this study also \n\nintroduces and provides data about the prevalence of the Myxobolus species. Considering \n\nthe two regions that were sampled, it was possible to observe that in cases of M. \n\ncolossomatis and Myxobolus n. sp. 1, which were reported in both places, the prevalence \n\ndid not differ significantly. In the same way, no significant difference was observed when \n\ncompared to the prevalence among the three Myxobolus species found. Additionally, \n\nthese data show, that despite being low, the prevalence was similar to the different regions \n\nand species, except with the Myxobolus n. sp. 2, which was absent in Amazonas state. \n\nThis absence may, however, be related to the lower sampling in this region. \n\nIn summary, this study provided data on the prevalence, morphology, molecular \n\nand phylogeny of two new species of Myxobolus and of M. colossomatis, and it clarified \n\nthe taxonomic context of the latter. Further to this, our data reinforce the suggestions of \n\nKent et al. (2001), Lom and Dykov\u00e1 (2006) and Fiala et al. (2015), that the association of \n\nmorphological and molecular data are fundamental to avoid taxonomic confusion in \n\nmyxosporeans. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements.

NOVEL MYXOSPOREAN SPECIES PARASITES OF Piaractus \n\nbrachypomus, AN ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT FISH FROM THE AMAZON \n\nBASIN \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nMyxosporeans are a group of parasitic cnidarians, with severe pathogeny of some species. \n\nThis paper describes two new species of myxobolid found infecting specimens of \n\nPiaractus brachypomus arising from the Amazon basin, Brazil, based on morphology, \n\nhistology, ultrastructural and phylogeny analysis. The fish were caught in the Tapaj\u00f3s \n\nriver Santar\u00e9m, PA, Brazil. The plasmodial development of Henneguya n. sp. 1 was \n\nintralamellar and of Myxobolus n. sp. 3 was in the pyloric cecum according with \n\nhistological analysis. For both species was observed no inflammatory infiltrate. For \n\nHenneguya n. sp. 1 mature myxospores were ellipsoidal measuring: 13.07 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m in \n\nlength, 4.3 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m in width, 3.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m in thickness. The polar capsules were \n\nelongated measuring 6.3 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b5m in length and 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m in width, each containing \n\npolar filament with 4 coils. The caudal process was greater than the length of the body, \n\nmeasuring 44.7 \u00b1 3.0 \u00b5m and the total length of the myxospore was 57.5 \u00b1 3.5 \u00b5m. \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 3 showed rounded mature myxospores measuring: 10.4 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5m in \n\nlength, 7.2 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m in width and 5.8 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5m of the thickness. The polar capsules were \n\nequal size and occupied less than half the myxospore, measuring: 3.8 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m in length \n\nand 2.6 \u00b1 0.1 \u00b5m in width, each containing polar filament with 6-7 coils. Phylogenetic \n\nanalysis, based on partial ssrDNA sequences and using the closest myxosporean \n\nsequences to each one of the species here studied, showed that Henneguya n. sp. 1. \n\nclustered in a well-supported smaller subclade composed by Henneguya species that \n\n\n\n85 \n \n\n \n\ninfect gills of the serrasalmid hosts, Myxobolus n. sp. 3 clustered in a subclade composed \n\nonly for Myxobolus species parasite of the different organs. \n\n \n\nKey-words: Myxobolus, Henneguya, Tapaj\u00f3s river, pirapitinga, ssrDNA. \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nMyxozoans are widespread cnidarian endoparasites and diverse and important \n\ncomponents for ecosystems. They have a complex life-cycle which involves annelids and \n\nbryozoans as definitive invertebrate hosts and mainly fish, but also other vertebrates, as \n\nintermediate hosts (OKAMURA et al., 2015). Phylogenetic DNA studies have shown that \n\nthe Myxobolus lineage (Myxobolus/Henneguya) is the largest within the myxozoan class \n\n(FIALA et al., 2015, Chapter 5), with around 850 Myxobolus and 200 Henneguya species \n\ndescribed, representing almost half the diversity of these cnidaria subphyla. However, \n\nonly 100 species (around 10%) have been reported infecting South American fish species \n\n(EIRAS; ADRIANO, 2012; EIRAS et al., 2014; ADRIANO; OLIVEIRA, 2019). \n\nThe Amazon basin is approximately 6.500 km2 in size, and is one of the most \n\nproductive and intact ecosystems on the planet. Due to its abundant water, it harbors vast \n\nfish diversity (VAL; HONCZARYK, 1995; GOULDING, 1996; SANTOS; SANTOS, \n\n2005). The native fish Piaractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818, popularly known in Brazil \n\nas \u201cpirapitinga\u201d, which occurs in the Amazon and Orinoco basins and can reach a weight \n\nof up to 20 kg and a length of up to 80 cm (SOBRINHO et al., 1984; MPA, 2013; \n\nFROESE; PAULY, 2018), is economically important for the region. Due to the high \n\nquality of its meat and rapid growth, the species is widely farmed in South America, and \n\nhas also been used in fish farming in Asia (FRESNEDA et al., 2004; HONGLANG, 2007; \n\nFLORES NOVA, 2007; LIN et al., 2015). In Brazil, P. brachypomus is among the largest \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\n \n\nnative fish species farmed, and is also important for crossing with other native species to \n\nproduce hybrid fish such as tambatinga (female Colossoma macropomum \u00d7 male P. \n\nbrachypomus) and patinga (female Piaractus mesopotamicus \u00d7 male P. brachypomus), \n\nwhich are equally important in fish farm production (MPA, 2013; IBGE, 2016).  \n\nDespite the commercial importance of this species in the context of fishing and \n\nfish farming in South America and in other regions where it has been introduced, nothing \n\nis so far known about the myxozoan fauna parasites of P. brachypomus. The present \n\nstudy, which is part of ongoing research into South American myxozoans, describes two \n\nnew myxosporean species found parasitizing pirapitinga specimens caught in a natural \n\nenvironment in the Amazon basin. The study was carried out using morphologic, \n\nhistopathologic, ultrastructural and small subunit rDNA (ssrDNA) based phylogenetic \n\nanalyses.  \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\nTwenty-five P. brachypomus specimens were caught between October 2014 and \n\nJanuary 2016 in the Tapaj\u00f3s River (2\u00b020\u201903.92\u201dS 54\u00b052\u201933.44\u201dW), in the municipal \n\ndistrict of Santar\u00e9m, in the state of Par\u00e1, Brazil. Authorization for the fish capture and the \n\ngenetic heritage access report were obtained from the Brazilian Ministry of the \n\nEnvironment under processes SISBIO n\u00ba 44268-4 and SisGen n\u00ba A33CB83, respectively. \n\nThe fish were transported live to a field laboratory and euthanized by spinal column \n\ntransection. This methodology was approved by the ethics research committee of the \n\nFaculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering of the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Process \n\nUSP: 14.1.391.74.9) in accordance with Brazilian law (Federal Law n\u00ba 11794, dated 8 \n\nOctober 2008 and Federal Decree No. 6899 dated July 15, 2009). \n\n \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\n \n\nMorphological analysis \n\nMyxosporean plasmodia were carefully separated from the host tissue and \n\nindividually ruptured in glass slides. Mature myxospores were measured using a Leica \n\nDM 1000 Microscope coupled with Leica EC3 camera and LAS EZ image capture \n\nsoftware. The dimensions of mature myxospores (N = 25) were obtained in according \n\nLom and Arthur (1989) and expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) and range, in \n\n\u00b5m. The slides were then fixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa to be deposited \n\nin the collection of the Ad\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University \n\nof Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. \n\n \n\nHistological analysis \n\nFor histological analysis tissue fragments containing the plasmodia were fixed in \n\nbuffered 10% formalin for 24h and placed in paraffin. Sections with a thickness of 4 \u00b5m \n\nwere then stained with hematoxylin-eosin and analyzed and photographed in a Leica DM \n\n1000 Microscope coupled with a Leica EC3 camera and LAS EZ image capture software.  \n\n \n\nTransmission electron microscopy \n\nFor transmission electron microscopy, fragments of infected tissue were fixed, for \n\nat least 12h, in 2.5% glutaraldehyde diluted in the cacodylate buffer at 0.1 M sodium \n\ncontaining 3% of glucose at pH 7.4. The sample were then washed in the same buffer per \n\n2h and fixed in OsO4 for 4h. After dehydration in increasing concentrations of acetone \n\nthe samples were embedded in Embed 812 resin. Uranyl acetate and lead citrate were \n\nused to treat ultrathin sections that, posteriorly, were examined in a LEO 906 transmission \n\nelectron microscope operating at 60 kV. \n\n \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\n \n\n Molecular analysis \n\nDNA extraction, PCRs and Sequence assembly \n\nHost tissue was used for correct host identification by sequencing the ?-\n\ntropomyosin gene. Ethanol-fixed myxospores were washed with Phosphate Buffered \n\nSaline (PBS) for DNA extraction and separate in microtubes containing the myxospores \n\nand host tissue were centrifuged at 13.000 rpm for three minutes, before the PBS buffer \n\nwas removed.  \n\nThe DNA was extracted with DNeasy\u00ae Blood &amp; Tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., \n\nCalifornia, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. For PCR reactions were used \n\n10 - 50 ng of genomic DNA, DreamTaq 12.5 \u00b5L of 2 \u00d7 PCR Master Mix (Thermo \n\nScientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA), 0.2 \u00b5M of each specific primer and nuclease free \n\nwater (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA) with final volume of 25 \u00b5L. In the \n\nssrDNA amplification of the myxosporeans were used the primers ERIB1 (BARTA et al., \n\n1997), ACT1R (HALLET; DIAMANT, 2001), TEDF (CAPODIFOGLIO et al., 2015) \n\nand ERIB10 (BARTA et al., 1997). The TROPF and TROPR (FRIESEN et al., 1999) \n\nprimers were used to amplifications of the ?-tropomyosin gene in accordance with \n\nHashimoto et al. (2011), followed by modifications. The PCRs were carried out in a \n\nProFlex PCR Systems thermocycler (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA) with \n\na program of 35 cycles for ?-tropomyosin gene at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 64\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C \n\nfor 10 s.  For ssrDNA was used an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes; 35 cycles: \n\n95\u00b0C for 60 s, 60\u00b0C for 60 s and 72\u00b0C for 90 s; and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 minutes.  \n\nAll the PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in a TAE \n\nbuffer (Tris\u2013Acetate EDTA, Tris 40 mM, Acetic Acid 20 Mm and EDTA 1 mM), stained \n\nwith Sybr Safe DNA gel stain (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA), and \n\nanalyzed in a LED transilluminator (Kasvi, Paran\u00e1, Brazil). The sizes of the amplified \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\n \n\nfragments were estimated by comparison with the 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo \n\nScientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA). The PCR products were purified using a \n\nQIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA) and sequenced with the \n\nsame primer pairs used in the reaction, as well as the additional primers MC5f, MC3r \n\n(MOLN\u00c1R et al., 2002) and BOBf (Present study, Chapter 1) for sequencing of ssrDNA. \n\nThe sequencing of all samples was performed using the BigDye\u00ae Terminator v3.1 Cycle \n\nSequencing Kit (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA) and an ABI 3730 DNA \n\nsequencing analyzer (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA).  \n\nThe DNA sequences obtained were visualized and assembled using BioEdit \n\n7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999) software. A BLASTn search (ALTSCHUL et al., 1997), available \n\nin the NCBI database, was performed to confirm the myxozoan and P. brachypomus host. \n\n \n\nPhylogenetic analysis \n\nPhylogenetic analysis was performed using the sequences obtained plus ssrDNA \n\nsequences of the closest myxozoans to each one of the new species, based on the BLASTn \n\nsearches carried out in the NCBI database. Four species of the genus Ceratomyxa \n\nTh\u00e9lohan, 1892 were used as outgroup. All the sequences were aligned using the \n\nClustalW algorithm (THOMPSON et al., 1994) by software BioEdit 7.1.3.0 (HALL, \n\n1999).  \n\nThe Maximum likelihood (ML) method was applied using the PhyML3.0 \n\n(GUINDON et al., 2010) software, with a bootstrap value of 1000 replications. The \n\nFigTree v1.3.1 (RAMBAUT, 2008) and Adobe Illustrator (Adobe Systems Inc.) software \n\nprograms were used to view and to edit, respectively, the tree generated. Only bootstrap \n\nvalues above 50 were displayed, and data related to the host fish, such as order and family, \n\nwere obtained from FishBase (FROESE; PAULY, 2018).  \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\n \n\nTo evaluate the genetic distance between the ssrDNA sequences of the new \n\nspecies with other myxosporean parasites of serrasalmids fish, a new alignment was \n\nperformed using the species focus and the pairwise method was applied using the p-\n\ndistance model in the MEGA 7.0 software program (KUMAR; STECHER; TAMURA, \n\n2016). \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\n \n\nOccurrence \n\nOf 25 P. brachypomus specimens collected, 22 (88%) contained myxosporean \n\nplasmodia. Seventeen (68%), had plasmodia containing myxospores typical of the \n\nHenneguya genus in the gill filament, while four (16%) had plasmodia harboring \n\nmyxospores with characteristics of the Myxobolus genus in the pyloric cecum. The \n\nmorphological and ssrDNA sequence analyses revealed that both are new myxosporean \n\nspecies, and their descriptions are provided below. \n\n \n\nTaxonomic data \n\n \n\nHenneguya n. sp. 1 (Figures 8A, 9 \u2013 11) \n\nType host: Piaractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818, Characiformes: Serrasalmidae. \n\nLocality of collection: Tapaj\u00f3s River, municipal district of Santar\u00e9m, state of \n\nPar\u00e1, Brazil (2\u00b023'07.5\"S 54\u00b047'05.9\"W). \n\nPrevalence: 17 of 25 (68%). \n\nSite of infection: Gill lamellae. \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\n \n\nType of material: Slides with stained myxospores were deposited in the \n\ncollections of the Ad\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of \n\nCampinas (UNICAMP), S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil (ZUEC \u2013MYX 86). \n\nDescription and host-parasite relationship: plasmodia white and elongated \n\nmeasuring up to 0.3 mm in length were found in the gill filament of P. brachypomus. The \n\nmature myxospores had fusiform shape in the frontal view and measured 13.0 \u00b1 0.5 (11.7 \n\nto 13.8) \u00b5m in length, 4.3 \u00b1 0.2 (4.0 to 4.6) \u00b5m in width, with caudal processes bigger \n\nthan the myxospore body, measuring 44.7 \u00b1 3.0 (40.5 to 48.1) \u00b5m and a total length of \n\n57.5 \u00b1 3.5 (52.4 to 61.6) (Figure 8A).

Scale Bars = 1 \u00b5m.  \n\n \n\nGenetics: The partial ssrDNA sequence with a fragment of 1971 bp, obtained \n\nfrom a single plasmodium of Henneguya n. sp. 1, was deposited in GenBank under \n\naccession number MK491272. BLASTn search revealed no match with any other \n\nmyxosporeans ssr DNA available in genBank. Pairwise comparison considering parasites \n\nof serrasalmid hosts revealed Henneguya piaractus Martins and Souza, 1997 as the \n\nclosest species to Henneguya n. sp. 1, with 5.1% of genetic divergence (Table 6). \n\nRemarks: the new Henneguya species was morphologically and genetically \n\ncompared with all species reported infecting freshwater fishes (EIRAS et al., 2005, 2014; \n\nMADDEN, 2002). The morphologically closest species to Henneguya n. sp. 1 was H. \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\n \n\npiaractus, which is a parasite of P. mesopotamicus, a congeneric fish to P. brachypomus, \n\nbut endemic to the La Plata Basin. These two species are so similar that morphological \n\ndistinction is an impossible task (Fig 8A and Table 5). In a typical sign of cryptical \n\nspeciation ssrDNA sequencing revealed 5.1% of genetic divergence between the two. In \n\nterms of Henneguya spp. parasites of Amazonian fishes, the myxospores of Henneguya \n\nn. sp. 1 resembled those of Henneguya amazonica Rocha, Matos and Azevedo, 1992, a \n\nparasite of Crenlcichla lepldota Heckel, 1840. They were similar in myxospore length, \n\npolar capsule width, caudal process length, total myxospore length, and infection site. \n\nThey differed in myxospore width (4.3 \u00b5m for Henneguya n. sp. 1 and 5.7 \u00b5m for H. \n\namazonica), polar capsule length (6.3 \u00b5m for Henneguya n. sp. 1 and 3.3 \u00b5m for H. \n\namazonica), number of polar tubule coils (8-9 for Henneguya n. sp. 1 and 6 for H. \n\namazonica), and host order/family (Characiformes: Serrasalmidae for Henneguya n. sp. \n\n1 and Perciformes: Cichlidae for H. amazonica). In the comparison with Henneguya spp. \n\nparasites of fish species from other regions, Henneguya n. sp. 1 exhibited \n\nmorphometric/morphological differences at least one of the following properties: size \n\nand/or shape of the plasmodia and myxospores, number of polar tubule coils, site of \n\ninfection and region of occurrence (EIRAS et al., 2005; 2014). It also differed in genetic \n\nidentity comparison (Table 6 and BLASTn analysis). The creation of a new taxon is \n\ntherefore proposed. \n\n \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 3 (Figures 8B, 12 \u2013 14) \n\nType host: Piaractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818 Characiformes: Serrasalmidae. \n\nType locality: Tapaj\u00f3s River, municipal district of Santar\u00e9m, state of Par\u00e1, Brazil. \n\nPrevalence: 4 of 25 (16%). \n\nSite of infection: Pyloric cecum. \n\n\n\n97 \n \n\n \n\nType of material: Slides with stained myxospores were deposited in the \n\ncollections of the Ad\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Cardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of \n\nCampinas (UNICAMP), state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (ZUEC \u2013 MYX 85). \n\nDescription and host-parasite relationship: plasmodia white and rounded \n\nmeasuring up to 0.2 mm in diameter were found in the pyloric cecum of P. brachypomus. \n\nMature myxospores with an oval shape in the frontal view, measuring 10.4 \u00b1 0.3 (10.0 to \n\n11.1) \u00b5m in length, 7.2 \u00b1 0.1 (7.0 to 7.6) \u00b5m in width, and measuring 5.8 \u00b1 0.2 (5.4 to \n\n6.3) \u00b5m in thickness in the lateral view (Figure 8B). The pyriform polar capsules occupied \n\nless than half of the myxospore, measuring 3.8 \u00b1 0.1 (3.5 to 4.0) \u00b5m in length and 2.3 \u00b1 \n\n0.1 (2.0 to 2.6) \u00b5m in width (Figure 8B), each containing a polar filament with 6-7 coils \n\n(Figure 14A) (Table 5).  \n\nThe parasite developed in the pyloric cecum, and the plasmodia were surrounded \n\nby a thin layer of connective tissue, but no inflammatory infiltrate was observed (Figures \n\n12A \u2013 B). \n\n \n\nFigure 12.

Myxobolus colossomatis Moln\u00e1r and B\u00e9k\u00e9si 1993 and Myxobolus cf. \n\ncolossomatis were the closest species to M. pirapitingae n. sp., with a similarity of 89%. \n\nRemarks: The new Myxobolus species was morphologically and genetically \n\ncompared with all the species reported infecting freshwater fish (EIRAS et al., 2005; \n\n2014; MADDEN, 2002). Of the parasites of serrasalmid fish, M. colossomatis, which also \n\nis a parasite of the Amazonian C. macropomum, was the morphologically closest species \n\nto M. pirapitingae n. sp. Similarities were observed in the length and width of the \n\nmyxospores, the width of the polar capsules and the number of polar filament coils. But \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\n \n\nsignificant differences were noted in the length of the polar capsules (3.8 \u00b5m for \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 3 and 5.6 \u00b5m for M. colossomatis), and the existence of myxospores \n\nwith elongated-ellipsoidal or oval shapes in M. colossomatis, compared with only oval \n\nshapes in the new species. In addition to the differences in size, the polar capsules of \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 3 were pear-shaped and occupied less than half the myxospore, while \n\nM. colossomatis exhibited elongated polar capsules which occupied half the myxospore. \n\nP-distance analysis revealed large genetic divergences of 10.7% between these species. \n\nIn relation to other South American Myxobolus species, Myxobolus n. sp. 3 myxospores \n\nresembled those of Myxobolus cordeiroi Adriano, Arana, Alves, Silva, Ceccarelli, \n\nHenrique-Silva and Maia, 2009.  The resemblances were related to myxospore length, \n\nwidth, and thickness, while significant differences were observed in polar capsule length  \n\n(3.8 \u00b5m for Myxobolus n. sp. 3  and 5.2 \u00b5m for M. cordeiroi) and width (2.6 \u00b5m for \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 3 and 1.4 \u00b5m for M. cordeiroi), number of polar filament coils (6-7 for \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 3 and 5-6 for M. cordeiroi), and order/family host (Characiformes: \n\nSerrasalmidae for Myxobolus n. sp. 3 and Siluriformes: Pimelodidae for M. cordeiroi). \n\nThe genetic analysis corroborated the distinctions between these species, showing them \n\nin different evolutionary lineages in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 15). In comparison with \n\nparasites of fish species from other regions, Myxobolus n. sp. 3 exhibited \n\nmorphometric/morphological differences in at least one of the following properties: the \n\nsize and/or shape of the plasmodia and the myxospores, the number of polar tubule coils, \n\nthe site of infection and the region of occurrence (EIRAS et al., 2005; 2014); it also \n\ndiffered in genetic identity comparison (Table 6 and BLASTn analysis).

Maximum likelihood tree showing the relationship between Henneguya n. sp. 1 and \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 3 and other myxobolids based on ssrDNA. The numbers above the nodes \n\nindicate bootstrap confidence levels. Dashes are shown for values under 50%. \n\n \n\n \n\nGenetic host identification \n\n The host species were confirmed as pure though the sequencing of the ?-tropomyosin \n\ngene of approximately 300 bp, demonstrating 100% of similarity with P. brachypomus \n\nspecies using BLASTn of the GenBank database. \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\n \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nHenneguya n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 3 are the first myxozoans described infecting \n\npirapitinga, an iconic species of fishing and fish farming in the Amazon. Histological analysis \n\nof both species revealed the absence of inflammatory infiltrate, which is a common feature in \n\nmyxosporean infections (SITJA-BOBADILLA, 2008). However, in Henneguya n. sp. 1 the \n\ngrowth of the plasmodia induced stretching of the epithelium and compression of the capillaries \n\nof the lamellae. In addition, there was displacement and deformation of the neighboring \n\nlamellae, demonstrating the pathogenic potential of this species in high intensities in farmed \n\nfish. Similar tissue damage has been observed in infections by H. piaractus, commonly found \n\nparasitizing the gill lamellae of the congeneric fish P. mesopotamicus in Brazilian fish farms \n\n(MARTINS et al., 1997; ADRIANO et al., 2005; MULLER et al., 2013). Under the conditions \n\nof the present study, Myxobolus n. sp. 3 did not demonstrate pathogenic potential, largely due \n\nto the site of infection and the changes observed therein. \n\nUltrastructural analysis of the host-parasite interaction revealed pinocytic channels in \n\nboth the species here described, a common strategy by which myxosporeans obtain nutrients to \n\nsupport sporogonic development inside the plasmodia (HALLETT; DIAMANT, 2001; EL-\n\nMANSY; BASHTAR, 2002; AZEVEDO; MATOS, 2003; OVCHARENKO et al., 2017). \n\nGenerative cells and young developmental spore stages occurred in the periphery of the \n\nplasmodium, while advanced sporogonic stages and mature myxospores were found in the \n\ncentral section, following a common sporogenesis pattern of Myxobolus/Henneguya plasmodia \n\n(ADRIANO et al., 2005; NALDONI et al., 2018). \n\nPhylogenetic analysis based on ssrDNA sequences revealed Henneguya n. sp. 1 \n\nclustering in a basal branch as a sister species to H. piaractus, which parasites the gill lamellae \n\nof the congeneric host P. mesopotamicus, but which is endemic to the La Plata basin \n\n(MARTINS; SOUZA; 1997; ADRIANO et al., 2005). Myxobolus n. sp. 3 clustered in a sub-\n\n\n\n105 \n \n\n \n\nclade composed of Myxobolus species which also parasite other South American serrasalmid \n\nfish. These results showed Henneguya n. sp. 1 and Myxobolus n. sp. 3 clustering in distinct \n\nlineages in the tree, corroborating the absence of monophyly in the lineage of \n\nMyxobolus/Henneguya parasites of South American serrasalmids, as stated in the present study \n\n(Chapter 1). \n\nThe present study expands our knowledge of the diversity of myxosporean parasites of \n\nAmazonian Serrasalmidae fish, describing two new species, and offering new insights into the \n\nevolution and host-parasite relationship of myxosporean infections in these important native \n\nfish for fishing and fish farming. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgement.

MORPHOLOGY AND PHYLOGENY OF TWO MYXOSPOREAN \n\nSPECIES PARASITIZING Piaractus brachypomus FROM THE AMAZON BASIN \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nMixosporids, belonging to the Cnidaria phylum, are obligate endoparasites, which mainly infect \n\nfish and which comprise more than 2,400 described species. They have a complex life cycle, \n\ninvolving an invertebrate and vertebrate host. Among the species of fish that harbor these \n\nparasites, the species Piaractus brachypomus, popularly known as pirapitinga, has great \n\neconomic importance, especially in the region of the Amazon basin, where it is widely found. \n\nThe objective of this study was to characterize, through morphological, molecular and \n\nphylogentic analyses, the new species of myxosporids found infecting P. brachypomus. In this \n\nstudy, 25 specimens of P. brachypomus were collected, of which 16 (64%) were infected in the \n\ngill filament with a Henneguya species and 3 (12%) with a Myxobolus species in intestine. The \n\nmorphological and morphometric analysis of Henneguya n. sp. 2 revealed myxospores with \n\nellipsoid shaped and prolongation of the valves were lager than the length of the body. The \n\npolar capsules were elongated and occupied less than half of the body. Molecular analysis \n\ngenerated a partial sequence of 1946 pb of the ssrDNA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a cluster \n\naccording to the order/family of the host, with Henneguya piaractus being the closest related \n\nspecies. Myxobolus n. sp. 4 in morphological analysis revealed myxospores with an oval shaped \n\nbody and polar capsules of the same size occupying less than half of the body. Molecular \n\nanalysis generated a 1950 bp partial sequence of the ssrDNA and phylogenetic analysis revealed \n\na cluster as a sister species of Myxobolus colossomatis. Sequencing of the ?-tropomyosin gene \n\nconfirmed that the collected fish belonged to the species P. brachypomus. The results obtained \n\nfor Henneguya n. sp. 2 and Myxobolus n. sp. 4 confirmed that both isolates are from species not \n\nyet described in the literature. \n\n\n\n112 \n \n\n \n\nKey-words: Henneguya, Myxobolus, Tapaj\u00f3s River, pirapitinga, ssrDNA. \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nMyxozoa subphylum is composed of microscopic cnidarians that have adaptations to \n\nparasitism (OKAMURA et al., 2015). There are some 2400 described species which the great \n\nmajority are myxosporeans (FIALA et al., 2015). These parasites infect mainly fish, in the \n\nnatural environment and fish farms, but also birds, amphibians, and reptiles (Bartholomew et \n\nal., 2008). With the development of aquaculture, the interest in the group has intensified, since \n\nmany species cause serious disease outbreaks that can generate significant economic impacts, \n\nespecially where prevalence rates are high. (FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006).  \n\nThe myxosporeans are highly specialized metazoan parasites characterized by \n\nmulticellular spores, with polar capsules containing an extrusible polar filament (FEIST; \n\nLONGSHAW, 2006). These organisms can be found infecting several organs and have high \n\nspecificity both for the host and for the tissues they infect (B\u00c9K\u00c9SI et al., 2002). In addition, \n\nparasites develop in plasmodia that may or may not cause tissue compression and an \n\ninflammatory host response (EIRAS, 1994; FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006). Most species are not \n\npathogenic, but several of them cause significant damage to their hosts (FEIST; LONGSHAW, \n\n2006). \n\nAmong the Myxosporea class, the genera Henneguya Th\u00e9lohan, 1892 and Myxobolus \n\nB\u00fctschli, 1882 are the most specious, with approximately 192 species described of Henneguya \n\nand 850 of Myxobolus (EIRAS; ADRIANO, 2012; EIRAS et al. 2014).  \n\nThe present study is part of a research that involves morphological and molecular \n\nanalyses for the identification of new species of myxosporeans found infecting the species \n\nPiaractus brachypomus Cuvier, 1818.  Using light microscopy and amplification of the \n\nssrDNA, we described new species of Henneguya and Myxobolus.  \n\n\n\n113 \n \n\n \n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS \n\n \n\nSample collection \n\nTwenty-five specimens of P. brachypomus were caught (SISBIO n\u00ba 44268-4 and SisGen \n\nn\u00ba A33CB83) between October 2014 and January 2016 from Tapaj\u00f3s River, municipality of \n\nSantar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1 State, Brazil. In total, twenty specimens (80%) were infected with myxozoan \n\nplasmodia. All the fish handling was approved by the ethics committee for animal welfare of \n\nthe Faculdade de Zootecnia e Engenharia de Alimentos, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 USP \n\nProcess USP: 14.1.391.74-9 (ATTACHMENT B).  \n\nImmediately after capture, the fish were transported alive to the field laboratory where \n\nthey were euthanized by transection of the spinal cord. After euthanasia, then were weighed, \n\nmeasured and an external analysis was performed in search of parasite plasmodia. \n\nSubsequently, the necropsy was performed to expose of the gills and the visceral cavity, in \n\norder to detect possible alterations in the characteristics of the organs and the presence of \n\nparasites. Fragments of host tissue infected with Myxozoa plasmodia were also collected for \n\nmolecular confirmation of the host. All material was fixed in absolute ethanol for molecular \n\nanalyses and in formaldehyde for morphological characterization of the myxospores. \n\n \n\nMorphological analysis \n\nFor morphological analysis, plasmodia fixed in formaldehyde were separated from the \n\nhost tissue, placed on a slide and ruptured. The measures of the myxospores was performed in \n\naccordance with Lom and Arthur (1989), using a computer equipped with Axivision 4.1 \n\nsoftware, linked to Axioplan 2 Zeiss microscope. Thirty-six mature myxospores of Henneguya \n\nn. sp. 2 and thirty-one of Myxobolus n. sp. 4 were photographed. The dimensions were \n\nexpressed as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). The slides were then fixed with methanol and \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\n \n\nstained with Giemsa to be deposited in the collection of the Ad\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Cardoso Museum of \n\nZoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. \n\n \n\nMolecular analysis and sequencing \n\nIn molecular analysis, after capturing images, the slides containing myxospores were \n\nwashed with PBS buffer and collected in a microtube. After centrifugation, one more washing \n\nwas done with PBS buffer to remove remnants of the ethanol. DNA was extracted using the \n\nDNeasy\u00ae Blood &amp; Tissue Kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA), according to the manufacturer's \n\ninstructions. DNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer \n\n(Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA) at 260 nm.  The ssrDNA was amplified by PCR and the \n\nreactions were performed with a final volume of 25 \u00b5L containing 10-50 ng of genomic DNA, \n\n12.5 \u00b5L of 2 \u00d7 DreamTaq PCR Master Mix (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA), \n\n0.2 ?M of each primer and nuclease-free water (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, \n\nUSA). The PCR amplifications were performed in a ProFlex PCR Systems (Applied \n\nBiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA) thermocycler with a program consisting of initial \n\ndenaturation carried out at 95 \u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (95 \u00b0C \n\nfor 60 s), hybridization (60 \u00b0C for 60 s) and extension (72 \u00b0C for 90 s) and a final extended \n\nelongation step at 72 \u00b0C for 5 minutes. \n\nPartial sequence of the ssrDNA was amplified using two primers pairs: ERIB1 (BARTA \n\net al., 1997) with ACT1R (HALLET; DIAMANT, 2001) and TEDF (CAPODIFOGLIO et al., \n\n2015) with ERIB10 (BARTA et al., 1997). PCR products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel \n\nelectrophoresis in a TAE buffer (Tris\u2013Acetate EDTA, Tris 40 mM, Acetic Acid 20 mM, EDTA \n\n1 mM), stained with Sybr Safe DNA gel stain (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA) \n\nand analyzed with a LED transilluminator (Kasvi, Paran\u00e1, Brazil). The sizes of the amplified \n\nfragments were estimated by comparison using the 1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Scientific \n\n\n\n115 \n \n\n \n\n\u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA). Amplicons were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification \n\nKit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA) according to the manufacturer's specifications, quantified in \n\n2% agarose gel electrophoresis and compared to Low DNA Mass (Thermo Scientific \u2013 \n\nCarlsbad, California, USA).  \n\nSequencing of the purified PCR products was performed with specific primers on the \n\nABI 3730 DNA sequencer (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA), using the BigDye\u00ae \n\nTerminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., California, USA).  \n\nAfterwards, the obtained sequences were visualized, edited and aligned in the program BioEdit \n\n7.1.3.0 (HALL, 1999) using the ClustalW algorithm (THOMPSON, 1994), and a consensus \n\nsequence was obtained for each sample. The consensus sequences were submitted to BLASTn \n\nanalysis for the search for similarity in the GenBank database (NCBI). The p-distance analysis \n\nwas performed in the MEGA 7.0 (KUMAR; STECHER; TAMURA, 2016) to verify the genetic \n\ndistance between the species of this study and other myxozoan sequences available in the NCBI.  \n\nFor the molecular characterization of P. brachypomus species, the DNA extraction from \n\nthe fish tissue was carried out in the same way as for myxosporeans. The amplification and \n\nsequencing of the ?-tropomyosin gene from the two specimens of fish infected by Henneguya  \n\nand Myxobolus were performed according to Hashimoto et al. (2011) using the primer pair \n\nTROPF and TROPR (FRIESEN et al., 1999). The amplification product was obtained and then \n\nsent for sequencing. The sequences obtained were subjected to BLASTn analysis of the \n\nGenBank database to search for genetic similarity and confirmation of the host species. \n\n \n\nPhylogenetic analysis \n\nFor phylogenetic analysis the partial ssrDNA sequences of Henneguya n. sp. 2 and \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 4 and closest DNA sequences from the NCBI database of genera Heneguya \n\nand Myxobolus were used to phylogenetic analysis. The analysis was performed using \n\n\n\n116 \n \n\n \n\nmaximum likelihood in PhyML software (GUINDON et al., 2010) and a bootstrap analysis of \n\n1000 replicates. Ceratomyxa vermiformis Adriano and Okamura, 2017 and Ceratomyxa \n\namazonensis Mathews, Naldoni, Maia and Adriano, 2016 were used as the outgroup. \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\n \n\nIdentification of the host collected  \n\nThe amplification of the ?-tropomyosin gene, resulted in a fragment of approximately \n\n300 pb. The sequences obtained were aligned with two other P. brachypomus sequences \n\ndeposited on GenBank (accession numbers: HQ420087 and AY817271), demonstrating 100% \n\nsimilarity. \n\n \n\nTaxonomic data \n\nTwo new species found infecting P. brachypomus from Tapaj\u00f3s River were \n\ncharacterized through of the morphological, molecular and phylogenetic analyses. \n\n \n\nHenneguya n. sp. 2 (Figures 16A, 17A) \n\nDescription: Plasmodia were rounded and yellow. Mature myxospores of Henneguya \n\nn. sp. had ellipsoid shape in frontal view, measuring 13.6 \u00b1 0.5 ?m length and 3.6 \u00b1 0.2 ?m \n\nwidth. In lateral view, the body spores were fusiform and symmetrical with 2.5 \u00b1 0.4 ?m \n\nthickness. Prolongation of the valves were lager than the length of the body, measuring 40.3 \u00b1 \n\n2.7 ?m, with a total spore length of 53.4 \u00b1 2.9 ?m. The polar capsules were elongated and \n\noccupied less than half of the body, measuring 5.0 \u00b1 0.5 ?m in length and 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 ?m in width \n\n(Table 7). It was not possible to count the number of coils of the polar filament by light \n\nmicroscopic (Figure 16A). \n\n\n\n117 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 16.

The comparison between these two species, through \n\nmorphological and morphometric analysis, showed some differences.  With respect to the \n\nmorphology, Henneguya n. sp. 2 showed elongated body when compared to H. pellucida and \n\nthe caudal extension of Henneguya n. sp. 2 was longer. The morphometric comparison revealed \n\ndifferences with respect to: body lengh (13.6 \u00b5m for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and 11.4 \u00b5m for H. \n\npellucida), polar capsule length (5.0 \u00b5m for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and 4.0 \u00b5m for H. pellucida), \n\ntotal length (53.4 ?m for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and 33.3 ?m for H. pellucida) and length of the \n\ncaudal extension (40.3 ?m for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and 24.1 ?m for H. pellucida). In addition to \n\nthe morphological and morphometric differences, there are differences in relation to the host \n\n(P. brachypomus for Henneguya n. sp. 2 and P. mesopotamicus for H. pellucida) and the \n\nlocality (the Amazon basin for Henneguya n.  sp. 2 and fish farms in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo for \n\nH. pellucida) (Table 7). The p-distance analysis, based in parasites species of serrasalmids fish, \n\nshowed Henneguya n. sp. 2 as closest species of Henneguya sp. 1 (Present study, Chapter 2) \n\nwith 16.3% of genetic difference (Table 8). \n\n \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 4 (Figures 16B, 17B) \n\nDescription: Plasmodia were rounded and yellow. Mature myxospores of Myxobolus \n\nn. sp. 4 had an oval body shape, measuring 12.9 \u00b1 0.5 ?m in length, 7.5 \u00b1 0.3 ?m in width and \n\n\n\n119 \n \n\n \n\n5.4 \u00b1 0.2 ?m in thickness. The polar capsules were of equal size, presenting 5.4 \u00b1 0.3 ?m in \n\nlength and 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 ?m in width (Table 7). It was not possible to count the number of coils of \n\nthe polar filament (Figure 16B).  \n\nType locality: Tapaj\u00f3s River, municipal district of Santar\u00e9m, state of Par\u00e1, Brazil \n\n(2\u00b023'07.5\"S 54\u00b047'05.9\"W). \n\nOccurrence: 3 of 25 (12%). \n\nSite of infection: Intestine. \n\nType of material: Slides stained with myxospores was deposited in the Ad\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 \n\nCardoso Museum of Zoology, of the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), S\u00e3o Paulo \n\nstate, Brazil (accession number ZUEC \u2013 MYX87). \n\nMolecular data: Sequencing of the ssrDNA resulted in a partial sequence of 1950 pb. \n\nRemarks: The partial sequence of ssrDNA of Myxobolus n. sp. 4 showed, according to \n\nBLASTn analysis, to be a distinct species from others species with sequences deposited in \n\nGenBank. The closest species was Myxobolus colossomatis Moln\u00e1r and B\u00e9k\u00e9si (1993) with \n\n94% similarity, described infecting several organs of Colossoma macropomum collected in the \n\nAmazon basin. Considering parasite species of serrasalmids, Myxobolus n. sp. 4 was the closest \n\nspecies to M. colossomatis. The comparison between these two species, through morphological \n\nand morphometric analysis, showed differences. With respect to morphology, Myxobolus n. sp. \n\n4 had an ellipsoidal shape and the polar capsules occupied half of the myxospore body, whereas \n\nM. colossomatis had an oval shape, an anterior end, and polar capsules occupying half of the \n\nmyxospore body. The morphometric comparison revealed similarities with respect to body \n\nlength and polar capsules width. The differences were with respect to: body width (7.5 ?m for \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 4 and 6.9 ?m for M. colossomatis), polar capsule length (5.4 ?m for Myxobolus \n\nn. sp. 4 and 6.0 ?m for M. colossomatis). In addition, there are differences in relation to the host \n\n(P. brachypomus for Myxobolus n. sp. 4 and C. macropomum for M. colossomatis) (Table 7). \n\n\n\n120 \n \n\n \n\nIn additional, the p-distance analysis, based in parasites species of serrasalmids fish, showed \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 4 as closest species of M. colossomatis (Present study, Chapter 1) with 6.3% \n\nof genetic difference (Table 8).\n\n\n\n121 \n \n\n \n\nTable 7.

In P. brachypomus two myxosporean species have been \n\nrelated previously, with Henneguya n. sp. 1 (Present study) parasitizing the gill filament and \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 3 (Present study) parasitizing the intestine.  \n\nBased on ssrDNA sequences of myxosporean parasites of serrasalmids fish, \n\nHenneguya n. sp. 2 was the closest to Henneguya n. sp. 1, both parasites of P. brachypomus \n\nfrom the Amazon basin, with 16.3% of difference, demonstrating that this host specie harbors \n\ntwo distinct Henneguya species which infect the gill filament. For Myxobolus n. sp. 4, M. \n\ncolossomatis was closest species with 6.3% of difference, but this species showed differences \n\nmorphologic and host, being sufficient to consider these two distinct species. \n\n Our phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the tendency of the myxosporeans to group \n\naccording to the host order as previous studies (FIALA, 2006; FERGUSON et al., 2008; \n\nCARRIERO et al., 2013; MOREIRA et al., 2014), as well as the influence of the infected \n\ntissue in which clustering occurred primarily by host affinity and after by tissue or organ \n\ntropism, positioning Henneguya n. sp. 2, as well Henneguya n. sp. 1 and Henneguya piaractus, \n\nas basal species of the major clade separated from the others myxosporids. Myxobolus n. sp. \n\n4 aggrouped as a sister specie of M. colossomatis in a well-supported subclade composed only \n\nwith Myxobolus species parasites of Characiformes fish from the Amazon basin and which \n\n\n\n125 \n \n\n \n\nwas closely related to Myxobolus species that infecting South American characiforms as \n\nobserved by Zatti et al.

REMARKS ON MITOCHONDRIAL BEHAVIOR IN \n\nMYXOSPOREANS \n\n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nMyxozoa are parasites that mainly infect fish, but also reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals \n\nand has a complex life cycle. The initial aim of this study was to amplify the mitochondrial \n\ngene Citochrome C Oxidase I of myxosporean parasites of Colossoma macropomum and \n\nPiaractus brachypomus from Amazon basin. Primers and protocols described in the literature \n\nas well as others primers were used for amplification, however, no amplification was obtained. \n\nThus, the present study consists in to report remarks about mitochondrial behavior in \n\nmyxosporeans of Henneguya sp. found infecting Astyanax altiparanae from CEPTA fish farm, \n\nof Pirassununga municipality, S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil. A total of 17 specimens of A. altiparanae \n\nwere collected and 9 presented Henneguya sp. plasmodia in the fins. Plasmodia was ruptured \n\nand myxospores were stained with MitoTracker\u00ae Orange and 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole \n\n(DAPI). The results showed that only some Henneguya sp. myxospores presented labeling for \n\nmitochondrial activity and all myxospores presented labeling for nucleuos.  \n\n \n\nKey-words: Henneguya sp., Myxozoa, mitochondrial fluorescence microscopy and COI. \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nAs important model organisms, cnidarians are fundamentals for research, where the \n\nHydra genus is the model organism used for understanding processes of morphogenesis and \n\nregeneration (CHAPMAN et al., 2010) and, also, as model of non-senescence (BOEHM et al. \n\n2013). \n\n\n\n131 \n \n\n \n\nBelonging to Cnidaria phylum, myxozoans are parasites that infect a wide range of \n\ninvertebrate and vertebrate hosts in worldwide (LOM; DYKOV\u00c1, 2006). With more than 2400 \n\nnominal species (ZHANG, 2011), they are distributed in 63 genera, and classified mainly by \n\nmyxospore morphology (FIALA et al., 2015). The genus Henneguya Th\u00e9lohan, 1892, \n\nencompasses approximately 200 species and are most commonly found in fresh water fishes \n\n(EIRAS; ADRIANO, 2012). Although most species do not cause disease, some are highly \n\npathogenic causing severe disease in economically important fish and give rise to serious \n\necological on their host populations (KENT et al. 2001; FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006; FEIST, \n\n2008; OKAMURA; GRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, 2015). \n\nWith a complex life cycle, myxosporeans have been identified in fish, repteils, \n\namphibians and birds (BARTHOLOMEW et al., 2008), around the world, but little is known \n\nabout their diversity, pathological impact on host, as well the biology these parasites \n\n(KOD\u00c1DKOV\u00c1, 2014). Regarding the biology of myxosporeans, myxospores are formed \n\nwithin plasmodia/pseudoplasmodia and they are characterized by multicellular myxospores, \n\ncomprised of external valve cells that enclose polar capsules containing extrudable polar \n\nfilaments and one or two sporoplasm cells (FEIST; LONGSHAW, 2006; OKAMURA, \n\nGRUHL; BARTHOLOMEW, 2015). \n\nTakeuchi et al. (2015) sequenced for the first time the mitochondrial genome of Kudoa \n\nspecies and suggested that the genome of Myxozoa is in general extremely divergent from \n\nothers metazoans. \n\nThe initial objective of this study was to amplify the mitochondrial gene of \n\nmyxosporeans found in Amazonian fish as Colossoma macropomum and Piaractus \n\nbrachypomus. In additional, was performed fluorescence microscopy to observe the \n\nmitochondrial activity of Henneguya sp. found infecting Astyanax altiparanae. \n\n \n\n\n\n132 \n \n\n \n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS \n\n \n\nCOI amplification in myxosporeans found in Amazonian fish \n\nSamples collection \n\nA total of 61 fish (25 of P. brachypomus and 36 of C. macropomum) were caught \n\n(SISBIO n\u00ba 44268-4 and SisGen n\u00ba A33CB83) in October 2014, March 2015 and January 2016 \n\nin the Amazon basin, in Santar\u00e9m, Par\u00e1 State and in Manaus, Amazonas State, Brazil. The fish \n\nwere transported live to a field laboratory and euthanized by transection spinal column. The \n\nmethodology of the present study was approved by the ethics research committee of the Faculty \n\nof Animal Science and Food Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Process USP: \n\n14.1.391.74.9 (ATTACHMENT B) in accordance with Brazilian law (Federal Law n\u00ba 11794, \n\ndated 8 October 2008 and Federal Decree No. 6899 dated July 15, 2009). \n\nDNA extraction \n\nDNA from the isolated myxosporeans samples was extracted with the DNeasy\u00ae Blood \n\n&amp; Tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., California, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions and \n\nwas quantified in NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, USA) \n\nat 260 nm. \n\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) \n\nPCR for amplification mitochondrial gene were performed with final volume of 25 \u00b5l, \n\ncontaining 10-50 ng genomic DNA, 12.5 \u00b5l of 2 \u00d7 DreamTaq PCR Master Mix (Thermo \n\nScientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA), 0.2 \u00b5M of each primer and free water of nucleases \n\n(Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA). For gene amplification, were used two pairs \n\nof primers (Table 9).  \n\nFor PCR amplifications were used a ProFlex PCR Systems (Applied BiosystemsTM Inc., \n\nCalifornia, USA) thermocycler. Initially, the reactions were performed in according to Folmer \n\n\n\n133 \n \n\n \n\net al. (1994) (Table 10).

The fish were caught using nets and \n\ntaken alive to laboratory. Before the examination, the fish were euthanized by lidocaine \n\noverdose. All the fish handling was approved by the ethics committee for animal welfare of the \n\nFaculty of Animal Science and Food Engineering, University of S\u00e3o Paulo Process USP: \n\n14.1.391.74-9 (ATTACHMENT B).  \n\nAfter euthanasia, an external analysis was performed in search of parasite plasmodia. \n\nSubsequently, the necropsy was performed with exposure of the gills and the visceral cavity, in \n\norder to detect possible alterations in the characteristics of the organs and the presence of \n\nplasmodia. Myxosporean plasmodia were carefully separated from the host tissue and kept in \n\nmicrotubes containing PBS. \n\nStaining with MitoTracker\u00ae Orange \n\nPlasmodium containing live myxospores was ruptured and myxospores released were \n\nwashed with PBS and centrifuged. After this, the myxospores were stained with MitoTracker\u00ae \n\n\n\n135 \n \n\n \n\nOrange (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA) for 30 minutes at concentration of 250 \n\nnM at room temperature. After stain, myxospores were washed three times with PBS and \n\nvisualized in inverted microscope Zeiss AxioVert A1 coupled with photographic camera Axio \n\nCan 503. \n\nPermeabilization and Staining with DAPI and MitoTracker\u00ae Orange \n\nPlasmodium containing live myxospores was ruptured and myxospores released were \n\nwashed with PBS and centrifuged. After this, the myxospores were permeabilized with PBS \n\ncontaining 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h. Myxospores permeabilized were washed three times with \n\nPBS, centrifuged, and stained with 4?,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride - DAPI \n\n(Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA) 0.004 mg mL-1 for 10 minutes. The samples \n\nwere rinsed with PBS and centrifuged to remove supernadant. Myxospores were then stained \n\nwith MitoTracker Orange\u00ae (Thermo Scientific \u2013 Carlsbad, California, USA) for 30 minutes at \n\nconcentration of 250 nM at room temperature. After stain, myxospores were washed three times \n\nwith PBS and visualized in inverted microscope Zeiss AxioVert A1 coupled with photographic \n\ncamera Axio Can 503. \n\n \n\nRESULTS \n\n \n\nCOI amplification in myxosporeans found in Amazonian fish \n\nDespite our efforts to obtain a COI gene sequence of myxosporids, no amplification was \n\nobtained. 16S F and 16S R are universal primers and were used for PCR walking method. \n\nHowever, the fragment of approximately 550 bp obtained was submitted BLASTn analysis \n\n(ALTSCHUL et al., 1997) which showed 100% of similarity with C. macropomum fish.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n136 \n \n\n \n\nTransmission electron microscopy in myxosporeans found in Amazonian fish \n\nUltrastructural analysis of Myxobolus n. sp. 3 found infecting pyloric cecum of P. \n\nbrachypomus showed several mitochondria in the periphery of the plasmodium and a reduced \n\nnumber of mitochondria in the central part of plasmodium (Figure 19A).

(1994), unsuccessfully. Then, primers (Table 9) were designed based \n\non COI gene sequences of species phylogenetically closer to the myxosporids deposited in \n\nGenBank. PCR conditions such as primer hybridization temperature (Table 10), extension time, \n\nDNA concentration and MgCl2 were evaluated for standardization for each primer studied. \n\nHowever, no amplification was obtained. \n\nTakeuchi et al. (2015) sequenced the mitochondrial genome of three species of the genus \n\nKudoa and observed that the genomes are not conserved among these species, suggesting that \n\nthe mitochondrial genes of myxosporids are, in general, potentially divergent. This may be one \n\nof the reasons why we can not achieve the amplification of the mitochondrial COI gene, since \n\nthere may not be a conserved region for the design of specific primers for amplification \n\nmitochondrial gene of myxosporeans. \n\nIn view of the difficulty found in the amplification of the COI, we begin to investigate \n\nthe mitochondria of the parasite analyzing the ultrastructural images of Henneguya n. sp. 1 and \n\nMyxobolus n. sp. 3, (Figures 19, 20), as well as other images of myxosporeans already published \n\nin the literature. And we observed, as well as Alama-Bermejo et al. (2012), that mitochondria \n\nare smaller in the sporogony phase than in the pre-sporogony phase. In addition to a reduced \n\nnumber of these organelles in the central part of the plasmodium where mature myxospores \n\nbecome agglomerated. \n\nWood et al. (2002) attempted to amplify mitochondrial genes of myxosporids without \n\nsuccess and thus stated that these parasites are amitocondrials. This statement is contradictory \n\nwhen compared to ultrastructural studies, where it is possible to identify many mitochondria in \n\nthe periphery of the plasmodium (OKAMURA et al., 2015).  \n\n\n\n142 \n \n\n \n\nBased on these studies, we assume that the mitochondrial activity could be related to the \n\ndevelopment phase of the parasite, being less active in mature myxospores. \n\nFor first experiment was only used MitoTracker\u00ae dye as an initial study and the \n\nmyxospores no marked suggested a possible waterproofing of the chitin wall of the mature \n\nmyxospore leaflets and as a consequence the non-penetration of the reagent. \n\nFor this reason, for the second experiment was performed the permeabilization of the \n\nmyxospore as also the labeling for nucleus with DAPI dye as described by Adriano and \n\nOkamura (2017) for the nucleus is a structure present in mature or immature myxospores. After \n\nthis, the same samples were stained with MitoTracker\u00ae Orange to the labeling for mitochondrial \n\nactivity. The results showed that all myxospores observed were able to emit fluorescence for \n\nlabeling of nucleus, but only some showed labeling for mitochondrial activity.  \n\nAccordding to Jirk? et al. (2007) in mature phase, the myxospore leaflets harden causing \n\na dormancy stage. Thus, the energy expenditure of mature myxospores can be reduced during \n\nthis period. \n\nIn myxosporeans is evident that the mitochondrial cristae can assume different shapes \n\n(GRIPARIC; VANDER BLIEK, 2001) and sometimes this can reflect in differences in \n\nbiochemistry within the same tissues (RIVA et al., 2005). \n\nIn a study of the ultrastructural features of Ceratomyxa sp. Diamant and Paperna (1989) \n\nreported mitochondria elongated and tubular in the plasmodium ectoplasm, while those inside \n\nthe sporoblast and developing myxospores were typically spherical and contained considerably \n\nmore matrix. Elmansy and Bashtar (2002) observed that numerous mitochondria, containing \n\nmore cristae were usually located close to the nucleus of the sporoplasm in myxospore \n\nmaturation of Henneguya suprabranchiae Landsberg (1987). Furthermore, glycogen-like \n\nmaterial were more common in the sporoplasm of the mature myxospores of H. \n\nsuprabranchiae, can represent an energy supply necessary for subsequent developmental stage \n\n\n\n143 \n \n\n \n\nof life cycle and may be similar to sporoplasmosomes of other myxosporeans (EL-MATBOULI \n\net al. 1990). \n\nSporoplasmosomes are intracellular structures present in the sporoplasm of the parasite \n\nand its function is still unknown (LOM et al., 1989), suggesting for us a possible energy storage \n\nthrough these structures so that the parasite becomes viable during the period of dormancy that, \n\naccording to Yokoyama et al. (1993), can last for months or years until the myxospore is \n\ningested by the invertebrate host.  \n\nThus, according to Feist et al. (2015), cellular processes involved in development have \n\nbeen highly modified in myxosporeans and many these modifications require further research \n\nand clarification. \n\n \n\nKEY QUESTIONS FOR FUTURE STUDY \n\n- Why only some myxospores presented mitochondrial activity? \n\n- Does mature myxospores really have inactive mitochondria? \n\n- Is there any structure inside mature myxospores able of storing energy? \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments.
