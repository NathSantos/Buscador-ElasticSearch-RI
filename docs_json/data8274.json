The Bitcoin stands \n\nout as the virtual currency that has achieved the highest market value to date and for being \n\nin circulation for more than 5 years.    \n\nThis study intends to investigate the existence of a dynamic relationship between \n\nBitcoin prices and economic and financial data whose relationship with physical \n\ncurrencies is known or it has been showed in previous studies. This data includes the \n\nCrude and Gold prices, the 6-month and 1-year U.S. Treasury Yields and the S&amp;P 500 \n\nIndex prices.  \n\nThe results of the study suggests that only the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields \n\npresents a long-term relationship with the Bitcoin prices.  \n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\nKeywords: bitcoin, nonstationarity, cointegration, vector error correction model. \n\n \n\n \n\nJEL Classification: \n\nC32 \u2013 Time-Series Models; Dynamic Quantile Regressions; Dynamic Treatment Effect \n\nModels \n\nE47 \u2013 Forecasting and Simulation \n\n  \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n \n\nv \n \n\nIndex \nIndex \n\nSum\u00e1rio Executivo ........................................................

O facto de a \n\nBitcoin permanecer em circula\u00e7\u00e3o desde 2009, com maior destaque desde 2013, e ter \n\nvindo a apresentar valores de mercado hist\u00f3ricos chama cada vez mais a aten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nestudiosos e investidores.  \n\nNa realidade, v\u00e1rios estudos e not\u00edcias t\u00eam vindo a identificar vantagens e \n\ndesvantagens \u00e0 sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, os quais poder\u00e3o atrair os investidores mais conservadores \n\ne acautelar os mais entusiastas, respetivamente. Parte das vantagens apresentadas s\u00e3o a \n\ntranspar\u00eancia, a seguran\u00e7a, os reduzidos custos de transa\u00e7\u00e3o, o anonimato, a possibilidade \n\nde troca por bens ou servi\u00e7os reais e a descentraliza\u00e7\u00e3o. Por outro lado, as desvantagens \n\nenglobam, por exemplo, o uso indevido da autoridade discricion\u00e1ria, a associa\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nmoeda a atividades ilegais, a instabilidade dos pre\u00e7os e falhas no anonimato e seguran\u00e7a \n\ndas carteiras ou transa\u00e7\u00f5es de Bitcoin.  \n\nInerente a estas carater\u00edsticas est\u00e1 a perman\u00eancia da Bitcoin ainda numa zona \n\ncinzenta da legisla\u00e7\u00e3o e pol\u00edtica monet\u00e1ria, na grande maioria dos pa\u00edses. Isto associado \n\n\u00e0 atividade criminal em que a moeda tem sido envolvida, alertou as autoridades de \n\nseguran\u00e7a e as entidades reguladoras dos mercados monet\u00e1rios, nomeadamente a \n\nFinancial Action Task Force e a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, deixando mais \n\nrelutantes as entidades competentes quanto ao avan\u00e7o para a sua regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nAinda assim, as cota\u00e7\u00f5es da Bitcoin t\u00eam apresentado uma tend\u00eancia de crescimento, \n\nsendo o seu valor a 28 de agosto de 2017 de 4.332 USD, onde o valor m\u00e1ximo de 4.346 \n\nUSD foi registado no dia 17 de agosto de 2017.  \n\nCertamente que seria aliciante identificar quais os fatores que t\u00eam vindo a \n\nimpulsionar o aumento de valor desta moeda virtual e, ainda mais atrativo, \u00e9 a \n\nidentifica\u00e7\u00e3o de dados que possam ser utilizados na sua estimativa e previs\u00e3o. De notar \n\nque as cota\u00e7\u00f5es da Bitcoin t\u00eam sido estudados por v\u00e1rios autores, sob diferentes \n\nperspetivas, nomeadamente na tentativa de identificar bolhas nos pre\u00e7os, identificar qual \n\na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o que melhor representa o comportamento da taxa de c\u00e2mbio da Bitcoin, \n\nexaminar as din\u00e2micas dos pre\u00e7os e prever a sua evolu\u00e7\u00e3o futura.  \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nNeste sentido, foi tamb\u00e9m atrav\u00e9s de estudos efetuados que demonstraram a \n\nexist\u00eancia de rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre o valor de moedas f\u00edsicas, como, por exemplo o D\u00f3lar \n\namericano, e determinados indicadores econ\u00f3mico-financeiros, que foi feita a sele\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\nvari\u00e1veis a utilizar neste estudo. Desta forma, as s\u00e9ries temporais consideradas s\u00e3o, al\u00e9m \n\nda taxa de c\u00e2mbio XBT/USD, os pre\u00e7os do petr\u00f3leo e do ouro, as taxas de juro a 6 meses \n\ne a 1 ano de obriga\u00e7\u00f5es do Tesouro americanas e os pre\u00e7os do \u00edndice S&amp;P 500. Todos os \n\npre\u00e7os est\u00e3o expressos em USD e as taxas em percentagem.  \n\nDepois de identificados o objetivo e as vari\u00e1veis em estudo, importa compreender \n\nse se verifica rela\u00e7\u00e3o no longo prazo entre a taxa de c\u00e2mbio XBT/USD e cada uma das \n\nvari\u00e1veis identificadas. Desta forma, consideram-se as bases metodol\u00f3gicas dos autores \n\nPerron (2005), Johansen (1991, 1995) e Granger (1969), compreendendo as respetivas \n\ntr\u00eas grandes parcelas: (i) em primeiro lugar, a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o da presen\u00e7a de n\u00e3o-\n\nestacionariedade e integra\u00e7\u00e3o de primeira ordem nas s\u00e9ries tempor\u00e1rias em an\u00e1lise; (ii) \n\nem seguida, o teste de cointegra\u00e7\u00e3o das combina\u00e7\u00f5es entre a taxa de c\u00e2mbio XBT/USD \n\ne cada uma das restantes vari\u00e1veis em estudo e, caso se verifique, a estimativa dos \n\nrespetivos modelos vetoriais de corre\u00e7\u00e3o de erros; e (iii) o teste de exogeneidade que, \n\ncaso se verifique exogeneidade fraca, implicar\u00e1 a aus\u00eancia de ajustamentos significativos \n\nna rela\u00e7\u00e3o de longo prazo e, consequentemente, a impossibilidade de utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nmodelo para previs\u00e3o da taxa de c\u00e2mbio XBT/USD.  \n\nRelativamente ao estudo da n\u00e3o-estacionariedade das s\u00e9ries, optou-se pela \n\nexecu\u00e7\u00e3o do breakpoint unit root test, uma vez que as representa\u00e7\u00f5es gr\u00e1ficas parecem \n\nindicar a exist\u00eancia de quebras estruturais no comportamento da taxa de c\u00e2mbio \n\nXBT/USD.  \n\nPor outro lado, o teste de cointegra\u00e7\u00e3o de Johansen foi efetuado para cada \n\ncombina\u00e7\u00e3o de duas vari\u00e1veis, isto \u00e9, para cada sistema entre as cota\u00e7\u00f5es da Bitcoin e \n\ncada uma das restantes vari\u00e1veis consideradas. Desta forma, simplifica-se a interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos resultados e permite-se concluir se existe rela\u00e7\u00e3o, assim como, de que forma se \n\nrelaciona cada uma das vari\u00e1veis com a taxa de c\u00e2mbio XBT/USD.  \n\nNo que respeita ao teste de exogeneidade, foi testada a presen\u00e7a de exogeneidade \n\nforte, para as vari\u00e1veis com exogeneidade fraca, por forma a verificar a exist\u00eancia, ou \n\nn\u00e3o, de rela\u00e7\u00e3o no curto prazo das respetivas vari\u00e1veis.  \n\nDesta forma, os resultados do estudo indicam que, embora se verifique cointegra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nentre as cota\u00e7\u00f5es da Bitcoin e as vari\u00e1veis em an\u00e1lise, apenas as taxas de juro a 6 meses \n\nde obriga\u00e7\u00f5es do Tesouro americanas apresentam uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o de longo prazo com as \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n3 \n \n\ncota\u00e7\u00f5es da Bitcoin. Por outro lado, as cota\u00e7\u00f5es da Bitcoin e do ouro apresentam uma \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o de curto prazo, visto ter sido apenas identificada exogeneidade fraca. \n\nDe salientar que somente o modelo Vetorial de Corre\u00e7\u00e3o de Erros estimado com as \n\ntaxas de juro a 6 meses de obriga\u00e7\u00f5es do Tesouro americanas poder\u00e1 ser utilizado para \n\nestimar os pre\u00e7os da Bitcoin, visto n\u00e3o apresentar exogeneidade. \n\nPor fim importa reter que, embora este estudo aponte para a possibilidade de \n\nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o das taxas de juro a 6 meses de obriga\u00e7\u00f5es do Tesouro americanas para previs\u00e3o \n\ndas cota\u00e7\u00f5es da Bitcoin no curto prazo, outros in\u00fameros fatores e limita\u00e7\u00f5es da \n\nmetodologia poder\u00e3o contrari\u00e1-lo, nomeadamente o facto do teste de cointegra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nJohansen assumir a inexist\u00eancia de quebras estruturais.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nFinancial Markets cover a huge amount of information, activities and tools used by \n\npeople in their quotidian actions or/and by organizations from all business areas. These \n\nMarkets can be divided into three main categories: Money Markets, Exchange Markets \n\nand Capital Markets (Cust\u00f3dio et al, 2008).  \n\nFocusing on the Exchange Markets segment, its basis is the purchase and sale of \n\ndifferent national currencies, establishing a relative price \u2013 the exchange rate. Anyone \n\nwho has travelled to countries with a different domestic currency is familiar with this \n\nconcept. In these cases, as it is exemplified by Hoover (2012), people can buy the foreign \n\ncurrency in banks, kiosks in international airports, train stations or even in most cities on \n\nthe relevant places. However, the same author refers that most foreign-exchange \n\ntransactions do not involve tourists, but rather banks and nonfinancial companies engaged \n\nin foreign trade. Actually, foreign-exchange markets cover not only the exchange of real \n\ngoods and services, but also of financial assets (Hoover, 2012), where the purchase and \n\nsale of currencies are included. Although these transactions could be done in a short time \n\nrange and when there is a need, they can be used as an investment.  \n\nSince exchange rates suffer appreciations and depreciations over time, there is an \n\ninvestment opportunity that does not come free of risk or of the cost of specialized \n\nanalysis. The risk factors that are unique to international investments are exchange rate \n\nrisk and political risk. (Bodie et al, 2011). \n\nAn investor can take a profit when the foreign currency he holds appreciates relative \n\nto his national currency. He can sell the foreign currency and then, the value he will \n\nreceive, in national currency, will be higher than what he paid to buy it. However, the \n\nexchange rate fluctuation can also result in losses, when the appreciated currency is the \n\nnational one. Therefore, at an organization level, international financial managers are \n\nresponsible for handling the continued high volatility of the relative values of currencies. \n\nDespite efforts to forecast foreign exchange behaviour, a wide range of economic, \n\nfinancial and speculative instabilities create major uncertainties (Copeland et al, 2005). \n\nIn a crisis context, as the one that has affected the financial markets since 2008, these \n\ndrivers are even more crucial. \n\nNevertheless, it was during this unstable period that the Bitcoin (XBT) emerged. \n\nUndoubtedly, it had a huge impact in exchange markets as we knew them. Bitcoin is a \n\ndigital, decentralized, partially anonymous currency, not backed by any government or \n\nother legal entity, and not redeemable for gold or other commodity (Grinberg, 2011). It \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n5 \n \n\nwas created in 2009 (Bojanova et al, 2014) and it follows the white paper [50] of Satoshi \n\nNakamoto (Chan et al, 2015), whose true identity no one knows.  \n\nIn Bloomberg, there are quotations of exchange rates XBT/USD and XBT/EUR \n\nsince 1st December 2011 and 10th September 2013, respectively. Similarly to the physical \n\ncurrencies, Bitcoin is subject to volatility, although on a higher scale. Observing the \n\nhistorical prices of XBT/USD (see appendix A), it is possible to conclude that the \n\nmaximum value of Bitcoin was registered at 17th August 2017, when 1 XBT was worth \n\n4.346USD. Looking back, at 29th November 2013, there was also a maximum value of \n\n1.137USD, followed by a huge depreciation. Indeed, since that date, the minimum value \n\nwas recorded at 14th January 2015, when 1 Bitcoin was worth 185USD.  \n\nIn Portugal, despite the existence of some machines where is possible to buy \n\nBitcoins, this topic does not deserve so much attention. One possible reason can be that \n\nthe application of this digital currency is still not very expressive in the country. However, \n\nthis tends to change with the growing media attention to this currency. It should be noted \n\nthat several foreign authors have studied the Bitcoin prices under different perspectives, \n\nnamely in the attempt to identify price bubbles, to identify the distribution that gives the \n\nbest prices fit, to examine the prices dynamics and to forecast them in the future. With \n\nthe continuous increase of Bitcoin prices, as well as the increase in the available \n\nobservations number, the investigation related with it study becomes even more \n\ninteresting.  \n\nIn this context, it would be appealing to identify what factors have been driving the \n\nBitcoin prices increase and, even more attractive, to identify what data factors can be used \n\nto forecast them. Consequently, it arises the present dissertation \u201cVirtual currency: A \n\ncointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data\u201d. The \n\ncurrent study examines the long-run and short-run relationships between the exchange \n\nrate XBT/USD and other economic and financial factors. Objectively, this study explores \n\nthe existence of a cointegration relationship between the variables. Additionally, it is \n\nestimated the vector error correction model which could be used (with lack of success, \n\nquite sure) to forecast the exchange rate XBT/USD.   \n\nIn fact, Engle &amp; Granger (1987) defined the cointegration as a formulation of the \n\nphenomenon that nonstationary processes can have linear combinations that are \n\nstationary. Therefore, it will be considered the methodological approaches of Perron \n\n(2015), Johansen (1991, 1995) and Granger (1969), comprising the respective following \n\nsteps: (i) testing the presence of non-stationarity and first-order integration in each time \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nseries considered in this analysis; (ii) testing the cointegration between the exchange rate \n\nXBT/USD and each of the remaining variables under study; and (iii) testing the \n\nexogeneity, since a weak exonegeity will imply the absence of significant adjustments in \n\nthe long-run relationship and, consequently, the preclusion of using the model to forecast \n\nthe Bitcoin prices.  \n\nRegarding the first step, it is applied the breakpoint unit root test, since there are \n\nsigns of structural breaks in the behaviour of the Bitcoin prices.  \n\nNext, it is computed the Johansen cointegration test for each combination of two \n\nvariables, that is, for each system between Bitcoin prices and each of the other variables. \n\nIn this way, the bivariate test simplifies the results interpretation, allowing to conclude \n\nwhether there is a long-run relationship and how the variables are related to the exchange \n\nrate XBT/USD.  \n\nFinally, it is tested the strong exogeneity, when the weak exogeneity is detected, in \n\norder to verify the existence, or not, of a short-term relationship between the variables \n\nthat do not show a long-term equilibrium.  \n\nThe economic and financial data under analysis are the crude and the gold prices, \n\nthe 6-month and the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yields and the S&amp;P 500 Index quotes. The \n\nreason for choosing these variables is that several studies have already showed their \n\nrelationship with different physical currencies. Nevertheless, since Bitcoin is a virtual \n\ncurrency and there are many legal blanks with regard to this, it is expected that the impact \n\nof economic and financial instabilities should be lower than in physical currencies. Then, \n\nthe tricky question is to understand if the data related to physical currencies also relate to \n\nvirtual currencies, in this case the Bitcoin.  \n\nThereby, this thesis aims to present and discuss models to explain the relationship \n\nbetween the Bitcoin prices and the economic and financial data referred before.  \n\nIndeed, the results showed that only the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields present a \n\nlong-run relationship with the Bitcoin prices, being possible to use their rates to forecast \n\nthe exchange rate XBT/USD in the short term. \n\nThe Chapter 2. begins with an overview of the present status of the Bitcoin \n\ninformation and researches. It is split into eight sub-sections, including a brief description \n\nof Bitcoin, its exchange markets and prices, its users, its main advantages, its main \n\ndisadvantages and risks, a comparison between physical and digital currencies, the \n\ncurrent Bitcoin regulation and main studies performed and their conclusions. Chapter 3. \n\npresents the data considered in this study, their sources and why they were included.  \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n7 \n \n\nChapter 4. outlines the econometric specifications and procedures applied to the data, \n\nincluding the methodology and approaches under non-stationarity, cointegration and \n\nVEC Model and exogeneity. Chapter 5. shows the empirical findings and the Chapter 6. \n\npresents the conclusions.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\n2. Literature Review \n\nBitcoin is a digital and decentralized currency which was created in 2009 (Bojanova \n\net al, 2014). However, the Bloomberg platform only provides quotations of XBT/USD \n\nand XBT/EUR exchange rates since December 2011 and September 2013, respectively. \n\nThis can be explained by the residual value of one Bitcoin during the first years of its life.  \n\nOn the other hand, given its recent creation and short life span, until recently, \n\nBitcoin has not received that much attention. As the notoriety of Bitcoin has increased in \n\nthe last few years, mainly due to the social media, by consequence the number of \n\nelectronic documents and academic journals articles on it has follow the same path. Even \n\nso, the knowledge on Bitcoin still does not offer a lot of insights (Carrick, 2016).  \n\nThis chapter presents an overview of a body of research and the present status of \n\nthe Bitcoin information.  \n\n \n\n2.1. Bitcoin: A Virtual Currency \n\nAccording to the white paper of the Bitcoin\u2019s creator, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, \n\nan electronic coin is defined as a chain of digital signature, where each owner transfers \n\nthe coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public \n\nkey of the next owner and adding these to the end of the coin. A payee can verify the \n\nsignatures to verify the chain of ownership [50]. \n\nBeginning by the way it works, Bitcoin is a digital currency system based on peer-\n\nto-peer1 virtual data. The peer-to-peer network used to distribute a master transparent \n\npublic ledger is also called blockchain (Harrel et al, 2017).  \n\nOn the other hand, Harrel et al (2017) described Bitcoin as a Proof-of-Work2 (PoW) \n\nbased currency that allows users to generate digital coins by performing computations, in \n\norder to limit the replication of Bitcoins and to preserve their value.  \n\nAdditionally, as referred by Bojanova et al (2014), to use Bitcoins, individual must \n\nestablish a Bitcoin \u2018wallet\u2019 on a computer. Therefore, Bitcoins can be transmitted to other \n\nuser wallets using a combination of public and private key cryptology. According to \n\n                                                             \n1 A Peer-to-Peer, or P2P, Economy is a decentralized model whereby two individuals interact to buy or \nsell goods and services directly with each other, without intermediation by a third-party, or without the \n\nuse of a company of business [38]. \n2 Proof of work describes a system that requires a not-insignificant but feasible amount of effort in order to \n\ndeter frivolous or malicious uses of computing power, such as sending spam emails or launching denial of \n\nservice attacks. The concept was adapted to money by Hal Finney in 2004 through the idea of \"reusable \n\nproof of work.\" Proof of work forms the basis of most, though not all, other cryptocurrencies as well [39]. \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n9 \n \n\nGouri\u00e9roux et al (2015), there are three types of wallets: the software wallet, the mobile \n\nwallet and the web wallet. \n\nIn their study, Harrel et al (2017) also explained that through the acquisition of a \n\nBitcoin wallet and one or more Bitcoin addresses, they can be accumulated on a \n\ncomputer\u2019s hard drive as electronic files or transferred just like an e-mail. By using a \n\nblockchain, each Bitcoin transaction is registered for all to see, protecting the Bitcoin \n\nnetwork against fraud and ensure that the files are not counterfeited. The blockchain is \n\nused to verify that the identical Bitcoins haven\u2019t been used in a previous transaction, there \n\nfor preventing double-spending of the same Bitcoins.  \n\nThe same authors clarified that the money supply is determined by a specific type \n\nof data \u201cmining\u201d activity, which depends on the amount of resources (electricity and CPU \n\ntime) that \u201cminers\u201d expend to solving specific mathematical problems. In this sense, the \n\nBitcoin mining process involves repeatedly running a computationally intensive \n\nmathematical function (called a cryptographic hash function) on a set of randomly seeded \n\ninputs until a specific pattern pops up.  \n\nFurthermore, Harrel et al (2017) mentioned that as of July 2016, the Bitcoin \n\nnetwork hash rate (total number of hashes per second made by all players) is estimated to \n\nbe in the neighbourhood of 1.432.000 trillion hashes per second (1.432.000 Thash/s), \n\ncontrasted with the 2014 rate of approximately 30.000 trillion hashes per second (30.000 \n\nThash/s), increasing at an astonishing rate due to more efficient specialized mining \n\nhardware now available on the market. At this rate, Bitcoin has become one of the largest \n\ndistributed computational efforts ever. \n\nAs noted by Guadamuz et al (2015), it is important to note that Bitcoin concept has \n\nbuilt-in scarcity because mining for coins becomes more difficult as time goes by and the \n\nmarket grows. The algorithms that produce new Bitcoin coins increase the amount of \n\nprocessing power necessary to create each new block, so producing new coins is more \n\ndifficult. This difficulty is built into the system to in order to keep the total amount of \n\nBitcoins at a maximum of 21 million. In practice, the first block \u201cmined\u201d was at difficulty \n\n1 and this is known as the genesis block. By June 2011, there were 131.301 blocks, \n\nmaking a total of 6.560.000 Bitcoins and a difficulty of 877.227. In June 2014, there were \n\n303.162 blocks with a total 12.800.000 Bitcoins in existence and a difficulty of over 10 \n\nbillion. At the time of their article writing, Guadamuz et al (2015) identified the existence \n\nof 359.657 blocks and just over 14 million Bitcoins had been \u201cmined\u201d, with a difficulty \n\nof over 47,5 billion, meaning that to  make a new block is 47 billion times more difficult \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\nthan it was for the initial block and four times more difficult than it was exactly one year \n\nbefore.  \n\nGiven its complexity, this topic has been increasingly studied by computer \n\nengineers and programming technicians.   \n\n \n\nFollowing the Bitcoins creation, they can be bought and sold on trading websites \n\nknown as \u201cexchanges\u201d, each of them are independently operated and accessible 24 hours \n\na day, 7 days a week to a global clientele (Pieters et al, 2016). \n\nHarrel et al (2017) pointed that some centralized virtual currencies take the form of \n\ndigital precious metals, such as e-Gold and Pecunix, where users exchange digital \n\ncurrency units ostensibly backed by gold bullion or other precious metals. Others exist \n\nwithin popular online games or virtual worlds, such as Farmville, Second Life, or World \n\nof Warcraft. Still others are online payment systems such as WebMoney and Liberty \n\nReserve, which are available generally outside of specific online communities and \n\ndenominate users\u2019 accounts in virtual currency rather than U.S. Dollars, Euros or some \n\nother national currency. Decentralized systems such as Bitcoin, which is relatively recent, \n\nare growing rapidly. A network of sites and services, including exchangers who buy and \n\nsell virtual currencies in exchange for national currencies or other mediums of value, have \n\ndeveloped around virtual currency systems, as well. \n\nMoreover, Pieters et al (2016) stated that Bitcoin has gained links to the physical \n\ngoods economy over time as retailers \u2013 including Windows, Dell, Overstock, and gift \n\ncard merchants \u2013 began accepting it as a form of payment, though not all use the same \n\nmethod. For example, Dell accepts direct Bitcoin payments, but Amazon instead provides \n\ndigital gift cards which may be purchased with Bitcoin and then used to purchase goods \n\non their website.  \n\nIndeed, the analysis of Baek et al (2015) suggested that the Bitcoin returns are \n\ninternally driven by buyers and sellers and are not influenced by fundamental economic \n\nfactors.  \n\n \n\n2.2. Exchange Markets and Bitcoin Prices \n\nIn order to accommodate growing demand several exchanges have been created, \n\noffering exchanges between Bitcoin and traditional currencies, including the Euro and \n\nU.S. Dollar and other digital currencies. According to Grinberg (2011), they include \n\nLiberty Reserve, Pecunix, and WebMoney. Several sites provide transaction services, \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n11 \n \n\nallowing individuals to keep, send, and receive Bitcoins without ever running the Bitcoin \n\nclient on their own computers. This author also stated that the Mt. Gox3 seemed to be the \n\nmost popular exchange with $10.000 in trading volume in March 2011, which had an \n\neasy to use website. It allowed sending Bitcoins through email, as Bitcoin Mail. In the \n\nother hand, Instawallet provides a website that allows individuals to create Bitcoin \n\naddresses, send Bitcoins to any address for free and check balances.  \n\nHarrel et al (2017) referred that new entrants appear almost daily in the Bitcoin \n\necosystem and include exchanges, transaction services providers, market information and \n\nchart providers, escrow providers, joint mining operations and so on. However, absent \n\nfrom this ecosystem at present are futures markets and entities offering legitimate \n\ninvestment returns, such as fractional reserve banks, although some individuals have \n\nannounced plans to build these. Their article also gives some examples of these well-\n\nfunded entrants, as Coinbase which was founded in June 2012 as a Bitcoin wallet and \n\nplatform where merchants and consumers can transact. Led by venture capital firm \n\nAndreessen Horowitz, Coinbase received a validation of concept and an initial $25 \n\nmillion investment. Coinbase lists contributed July 2016 capital of $1,06 million, and \n\nother metrics as: 3.200.000 users, 42.000 merchants, U.S. bank integration, 800.000 \n\nconsumer wallets and 8.000 developer applications. \n\nThese exchanges have acquiring special importance, since late adopters and \n\ninterested individuals cannot hope to mine new coins and, therefore, the Bicoin economy \n\nrelies on users buying Bitcoins with fiat currencies4 through exchanges (Guadamuz et al, \n\n2015). \n\nMoreover, it was also introduced in the market \u201cBitcoin ATM machines\u201d. They \n\nwere available in Canada, London, Seattle, Washington and Austin (Texas) as of early \n\n2014, and this availability had grown to 560 machines worldwide by early 2016, with 239 \n\nlocated in the United States (Harrel et al, 2017). \n\n \n\n                                                             \n3 Mt. Gox was one of the earliest and most public downfalls of the Bitcoin era. In early 2014, Mt. Gox stood \natop the field of Bitcoin exchanges as the largest, until it declared bankruptcy following the disappearance \nof almost $500 million Bitcoins and cash from its coffers. Some 200.000 of those Bitcoins were eventually \n\nfound, leaving 650.000 still missing. In the time since, many analysts, former Mt. Gox investors, and others \n\nhave speculated as to where the missing currency is. This is particularly important as Bitcoin's price has \n\nsoared in recent months: the missing Bitcoins could be worth as much as $2 billion at this point [41]. \n4 Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical \ncommodity [36]. \n \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nGiven the many different Bitcoin exchanges available, each with varying popularity \n\nand currencies that Bitcoin is denoted in, Urquhart (2016) resorted to the \n\nwww.bitcoinaverage.com, to collect data to its study. This is the first aggregated Bitcoin \n\nprice index that aggregates rates from all available Bitcoin exchanges around the world \n\nand provides a volume weighted average Bitcoin price, enabling a worldwide perspective \n\non the price and therefore efficiency of Bitcoin. At present Bitcoin adoption can be \n\nmeasured with varying degrees of accuracy across a variety of metrics, such as number \n\nof wallets, number of Bitcoin accepting businesses, number of transactions and exchange \n\ntrading volume (Hileman, 2015). \n\nSeveral studies had being performed indicating that Bitcoin users must be exposed \n\nto exchange rate fluctuations, as exhibited in appendix A. Indeed, fluctuating Bitcoin \n\nprices have attracted media attention and have been associated with billions of dollars of \n\ntrading volume. The exchange rate for Bitcoin to fiat currencies is determined by supply \n\nand demand and there is no governmental authority or company making guarantees about \n\nits value. (Athey et al, 2016). \n\nOn a different note, Carrick (2016) emphasized the currencies influence from news \n\nsources. It is common knowledge that information disseminated to the public influences \n\nthe supply and demand of currencies. For most currencies, the value is determined by the \n\nmarkets, which relies on information to determine the price. Various studies have looked \n\nat the effect of news announcements on currency prices, most of these studies looked at \n\nthe volatility that was linked to the news. In spite of no study has looked specifically at \n\nBitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, the Carrick's article mentions that news and \n\ninformation on the internet seems to influence the price of Bitcoin and, overall, the \n\nliterature shows that the forces influencing fiat currencies apply to Bitcoin. \n\nIn fact, there are communication channels spread around the world that report \n\nmaximum values reached by Bitcoin, such as \u201cO Jornal Econ\u00f3mico\u201d [25], \u201cBBC\u201d [7] and \n\n\u201cCNN\u201d [56], also more in-depth articles on Bitcoin can be found, for example, in \n\n\u201cForbes\u201d [26]. \n\n \n\n2.3. Bitcoin Users \n\nAccording to Grinberg (2011), individuals holding this currency represent a number \n\nof interests, including technology early adopters, privacy and cryptography enthusiasts, \n\ngovernment-mistrusting \u201cgold bugs\u201d, criminals and speculators.  \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n13 \n \n\nOn the other hand, the article of Guadamuz et al (2015) refers that the average \n\nBitcoin user is a 32-year-old libertarian male, motivated by curiosity, profit and politics. \n\nAdditionally it is mentioned that computer science and illegal activity were some of the \n\nmost prevalent topics linked with Bitcoin, with less correlation to political discourse and \n\ninvestment. The same authors also affirmed that an important core of the Bitcoin \n\ncommunity consists of libertarian types of all stripes, from those who want to see the end \n\nof all fiat currencies, to slightly more moderate and pragmatic supporters. \n\nGiven the existence of group of Bitcoin enthusiasts and users, a large number of \n\nonline merchants is currently accepting Bitcoins, catering to individuals with these \n\ninterests, including web hosts, online casinos, illicit drug marketplaces, auction sites, \n\ntechnology consulting firms, and adult media and sex toy merchants. Farther, a number \n\nof non-profit organizations such as Wikileaks accept donations in Bitcoin. And a small \n\nhandful of retail businesses accept Bitcoins, even if there is little indication that these \n\nretail establishments are significant (Grinberg, 2011). Likewise, Harrel et al (2017) \n\nmentioned in their article that by mid-year 2014, at least 65.000 global companies had \n\nannounced acceptance of Bitcoins, including DISH Network, online travel site Expedia \n\nand Dell, which alone had nearly $57 billion in 2013 sales. \n\n \n\nAlternatively, in the first attempt to provide a rigorous answer to the question of \n\nwhere a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin has the most and the least relative potential for \n\nadoption, Hileman (2015) introduced a new composite indicator that ranks Bitcoin\u2019s \n\npotential utility across 178 countries - the Bitcoin Market Potential Index (BMPI). Some \n\nof the 40 BMPI variables are likely to have a greater degree of influence over Bitcoin \n\nadoption than other variables and these variables were therefore afforded additional \n\nweight in the index. A variety of factors were considered in determining variable \n\nweightings. \n\nThe results showed that the 10 countries with the highest relative potential for \n\nBitcoin adoption according to the Bitcoin Market Potential Index are Argentina, \n\nVenezuela, Zimbabwe, Malawi, United States, Belarus, Nigeria, Congo, Iceland and Iran \n\nby the standardized method. The index rankings re-scaled data are broadly similar to \n\nstandardized results. \n\nGiven the BMPI\u2019s criteria it is not surprising to see Argentina ranked number one. \n\nThe country suffers from persistently high inflation, has a large informal economy and \n\nregularly experiences financial crisis. In addition, Argentina has a relatively high degree \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nof technology penetration and controls on the movement of capital. Argentina also \n\nrecently defaulted on its sovereign debt for the second time in 13 years. \n\nThe same author also mentioned a country that often features in Bitcoin discussions, \n\nwhich is ranked 27th - China. China\u2019s BMPI ranking is lowered by its relatively-small \n\nblack market and fewer recent financial crises. For some time, Bitcoin exchanges have \n\nreported Yuan-Bitcoin trading volume well in excess of the second most active currency \n\npair, Dollar-Bitcoin. However, non-Chinese nationals are free to trade Yuan-Bitcoin on \n\nexchanges, and there are unconfirmed rumours that self-reported Bitcoin exchange \n\ntrading volume is significantly inflated for marketing purposes.  \n\nNear the bottom of the overall BMPI rankings at number 169 is Ireland. While \n\nIreland scores well in some categories, such as technology and Bitcoin penetration, the \n\ncountry has wrestled with deflationary pressures in recent years and also has a relatively \n\nlimited set of restrictions on the flow of capital. Following a similar perspective, Portugal \n\nis in the 123rd BMPI rank. \n\nLastly, it should be noted that it is unclear how to score Bitcoin regulation and it \n\nhas therefore been excluded from the BMPI. Nevertheless, a more aggressive Bitcoin \n\nregulation in countries such as Ecuador and Bolivia may ultimately serve as a significant \n\nbarrier. \n\n \n\n2.4. Main Bitcoin Advantages \n\nBased on the various studies on Bitcoin, there are a number of advantages that this \n\ncybercurrency presents. \n\ni) Transparency: All transactions are publicly available and verifiable in the \n\nelectronic ledger called the blockchain, providing an unprecedented level of transparency \n\nand peer verification. It is one of the features that transcends currency elements \n\n(Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nii) Security: Bitcoin uses the 256-bit version of the secure hash algorithm (SHA), \n\nan encryption protocol designed by the U.S. National Security Agency. The protocol \n\nmaintains the integrity of the blockchain, but is also used to sign and secure Bitcoin \n\nwallets, providing a mathematical proof that transactions are performed from the owner \n\nof the wallet. The signature also prevents the transaction from being altered by anybody \n\nonce it has been issued (Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\niii)  Lower transaction costs: One of the main advantages of Bitcoin is that its \n\ntransactions are open to the public and, as there are no intermediates involved, supposed \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n15 \n \n\nto be without transactions fees. In fact, the system usually has transaction fees that vary \n\nfrom one exchange to the other. Even with these fees, which go to the miner as an \n\nincentive, Bitcoin still boasts lower transaction costs when compared to other payment \n\nmethods. Some merchants estimate that the average is at one percent, as opposed to other \n\nintermediary clearinghouses such as PayPal and Western Union, which charge from two \n\nto four percent. However, it must be noted that some researchers believe that low \n\ntransaction costs will not sustainable in the future (Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nThis is especially relevant to improve the quality of life for the world\u2019s poorest, \n\nenabling migrants to make cheaper remittances of payments to their families in \n\ndeveloping countries. Indeed, the World Bank estimates that such remittances totalled \n\n$582 billion in 2015, of which $432 billion went to developing countries, involving some \n\n232 million migrants. By 2016, data shows that world remittances have grown to more \n\nthan $601 billion, with developing countries receiving over $440 billion (Harrel et al, \n\n2017). \n\niv)  Anonymity: Bitcoin is theoretically anonymous. A person in possession of \n\nBitcoin in an encrypted wallet can spend it in any service without identification \n\n(Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nv) Resilience: Since Bitcoin is a decentralized currency with no central authority \n\nand no issuing body, it is resilient to attacks and in theory it also cannot be brought down \n\n(Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nvi)  Engine for innovation: While it is easy to ignore some criticisms made to \n\nBitcoin, it cannot be denied that its creation has given a much needed push towards \n\ninnovation in the way in which we think about money, financial institutions and centrality \n\n(Guadamuz et al, 2015).  \n\nvii) Real-life payments: In contrary to the most virtual currencies, Bitcoin can be \n\nexchanged for real-life goods and services on a limited basis (Pandey et al, 2014).  \n\nviii)  Decentralized markets: Blockchains compete with banks as organizations, \n\nenabling banking transactions to shift out of centralized hierarchical organizations and \n\nback into decentralized markets. As blockchain technologies work through banking, at \n\nthe margins of measurement, monitoring and new forms of automated governance, they \n\nwill enable a deeper process of institutional evolution to begin to unfold (Allen et al, \n\n2016). In Baek et al\u2019s perspective (2015), Bitcoin is a panacea to replace financial \n\ninstitutions, an alternative to cash and a hedge against economies with rampant inflation. \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n2.5. Main Bitcoin Disadvantages and Risks \n\nIn contrast to the advantages presented above, there is also a set of disadvantages \n\nor risks identified by some authors.  \n\ni) Improper use of discretionary authority: Bitcoin is believed to have no central \n\ninstitution with discretionary authority to increase the money supply more quickly than \n\nthe inflation rate built into the software. However, either the developers or a \u201cconvincing \n\ncoalition\u201d5 could probably exercise discretionary authority to change the inflation rate. \n\nSuch an exercise of discretion, even if done with good intentions and supported by a \n\nmajority of Bitcoin users, may nevertheless cause many individuals to lose confidence in \n\nBitcoin and sell off their holdings, starting a panic (Grinberg, 2011). \n\nii) Government crackdown: Currently the Bitcoin system fails to satisfy the \n\n\u201cMisean Regression Theorem,\u201d which explains that money becomes accepted not \n\nbecause of a government decree or social convention, but because it has its roots in a \n\ncommodity expressing a certain purchasing power (Harrel et al, 2017). Although Bitcoin \n\nmay be difficult to shut down because of its decentralized nature, a government \n\ncrackdown on Bitcoin may nevertheless cause a crisis of confidence, especially if many \n\nBitcoin users do not want to own a currency that is associated with criminality (Grinberg, \n\n2011). \n\niii)  Illegal activity:  Illegal transactions were one of the first economic activities \n\nwhere Bitcoin gained use as an alternative currency due to its relative anonymity, \n\nefficiencies and other conveniences (Hileman, 2015). According to Harrel et al (2017), \n\nthe evolution of virtual currencies has suffered from a highly visible connection to \n\ncriminal activities including: attacks on businesses and corporate extortion, child and \n\nsexual exploitation, pornography, corporate espionage, illicit drug distribution, \n\ncommerce in fake identifications and passports, investment fraud, stolen credit cards, \n\nterrorism and trafficking in weapons. The U.S. Secret Service believes the reasons of \n\ndigital currencies preference by criminals are: anonymity for both users and transactions, \n\nability to quickly and confidently move illicit proceeds from one country to another, \n\nwidespread adoption in the criminal underground and trustworthiness. Actually, on \n\nJanuary 16, 2014, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced \n\nthe forfeiture of 29,655 Bitcoins (worth approximately $28 million) and the forfeiture of \n\nthe Silk Road hidden website, which was just one of several anonymous networks that \n\n                                                             \n5 This is, a group that releases a compatible version of Bitcoin with different inflation settings and convinces \na majority of users to switch (Grinberg, 2011). \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n17 \n \n\nbecame possible with the advent of relatively easy-to-use browser interfaces (Harrel et \n\nal, 2017). This bad reputation has a negative and direct impact on the Bitcoin users' \n\nconfidence. \n\nOne of the most recent and widely publicized criminal actions involving Bitcoin \n\nwas the HBO files theft, including what appear to be scripts from five \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d \n\nepisodes, by hackers who demanded millions in Bitcoins [57].  \n\niv)  Instability: Bitcoin has been tremendously unstable throughout its trading \n\nhistory. Indeed, the currency has crashed several times and the price continues to swing \n\nup and down repeatedly. Such instability is one of the reasons why it is very unlikely to \n\nbe a viable currency. With wild variations in price, it is possible to lose money even before \n\nsome transaction has been completed. This makes it too unstable and seems to be keeping \n\naway investors, making it an unreliable means of payment (Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nv) Deflationary spiral: Also related with the instability, Bitcoin might undergo a \n\ndeflationary spiral that causes certain individuals or industries to abandon Bitcoin, \n\npossibly causing a panic or just a permanent depression in Bitcoin\u2019s value. Since the upper \n\nlimit of Bitcoins is fixed at 21 million, Bitcoins will become more valuable over time as \n\nthe supply of government-backed fiat currencies continue to increase. As prices \n\ndenominated in Bitcoins fall, producers may respond by lowering production, leading to \n\nlower wages, lower demand, and further decreases in prices. The end result of such a \n\nspiral is underemployed human capital and other means of production and destruction of \n\nwealth. Thus, industries using Bitcoin that fall into such a spiral may decide to abandon \n\nBitcoin. Even the possibility of such a spiral may limit Bitcoin\u2019s reach (Grinberg, 2011). \n\nvi)  Anonymity failure: All Bitcoin transactions are public, but are considered \n\nanonymous because nothing ties individuals or organizations to the accounts that are \n\nidentified in the transactions (Grinberg, 2011). Since the currency is encrypted, there is \n\ntheoretically no method to trace any given transaction to individual users (Guadamuz et \n\nal, 2015).  \n\nHowever, Guadamuz et al (2015) stated that many papers express serious doubts \n\non the much-heralded anonymity present in Bitcoin. If any of this information was \n\npublicly available, or accessible by, say, law enforcement agencies, then the identities of \n\nusers involved in related transactions may also be at risk. The same authors mentioned a \n\ncase study, where it was considered a highly-publicised theft of 25.000 Bitcoins, with a \n\nvalue at the time of theft of approximately US$ 500.000. On this case, it was possible to \n\nfollow the involved transactions using network tools and charted these with high level of \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\naccuracy. Therefore, it was concluded that using network analysis and network \n\nrepresentation it is possible to map many users to their public keys. Grinberg (2011) also \n\nunderlined that such unexpected and sudden exposure would obviously be deleterious to \n\nBitcoin\u2019s value.  \n\nvii) Lack of security: As referred by Grinberg (2011), keeping Bitcoins on one\u2019s \n\ncomputer can be as dangerous as keeping large sums of cash in one\u2019s physical wallet, and \n\neach user should take care to backup and secure his Bitcoin wallet. A large-scale theft of \n\nBitcoins from many users could create a confidence crisis, similar to what happened with \n\nMt. Gox in 2014 [41]. \n\nviii)  Denial of service: Although Bitcoin is decentralized and generally has no \n\nsingle point of failure, it is nevertheless susceptible to a form of denial of service attack. \n\nIndividuals with a majority of the computational power in the Bitcoin mining network \n\ncan effectively preclude any transaction from being processed. Such a sustained attack \n\nmight significantly depress the exchange rate and lead to a collapse of confidence. \n\nActually, several parties might have sufficient interest to do it: governments who want to \n\nshut Bitcoin down, individuals with future liabilities in Bitcoins, or hackers who want to \n\nblackmail a business that relies on Bitcoins (Grinberg, 2011). \n\nix) Lack of transparency: A main selling points of Bitcoin is transparency. The \n\naddresses do not identify the person, only the possessor of the key that unlocks the \n\naddress, what makes it both anonymous and transparent at the same time. However, this \n\ntransparency is in practice limited when one considers the currency\u2019s origins. Satoshi \n\nNakamoto, the fabled originator of the scheme, remains anonymous to this day. The fact \n\nthat some investors have amassed large Bitcoin fortunes is an indication that this could \n\nbe used to leverage the market. There have been several examples of possible market \n\nmanipulation, with sudden large volumes in trade used to shift the price up or down. For \n\nsuch a transparent currency from a technical standpoint, this remains a rather difficult \n\narea for outsiders (Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nx) Lack of replicability: Most Bitcoins exist only as files in a computer or mobile \n\ndevice. This creates one of the biggest issues with Bitcoin to date: the ease of losing one. \n\nIf the wallet file is lost, then the Bitcoins it contains are lost forever. It must be said that \n\nmissing and lost coins has not been seen as a problem for enthusiasts, as they point out \n\nthat each Bitcoin is divisible up to eight decimal points. However, this difficulty will only \n\ngo up, so an individual cannot hope to have the processing power to develop new coins, \n\nsince this can only be done currently through pool mining CPU resources. While this \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n19 \n \n\nmodel is trying to replicate scarcity in the market, it acts as a punishing disadvantage for \n\nlate adopters, and means that early adopters have market power if they hoarded coins \n\n(Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nxi) Growing centrality: One of the foundational principles of Bitcoin is its \n\ndecentralized nature. Assuming that thousands of people are mining separately, the \n\nsystem remains decentralized and the prospect of a single entity gaining control of the \n\nnetwork was seen as very remote. However, in June 2014 two computer scientists from \n\nCornell University stated that a large mining conglomerate was becoming too powerful, \n\nand had actually reached 51 percent of all mining capacity for Bitcoin during a few hours. \n\nEssentially the system was no longer decentralized. More pragmatic developers have \n\nproposed technical solutions. However, the truth is that until a long-term technical \n\nsolution is reached, Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized nature relies entirely on the good will of \n\nminers. If Bitcoin in its present shape reached an important share of the financial market, \n\nit would be possible for an entity with substantial computing power to take over the entire \n\nsystem. The prospect of a government or corporation taking over Bitcoin would be a real \n\nthreat (Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nxii) Computational inefficiency: A less-explored area of concern with Bitcoin is \n\nthat, at least as currently implemented, it might be energy inefficient. Bitcoin generates \n\nvalue by requiring those who participate in the network to dedicate computing power to \n\nverify transactions. This presents two problems for the scalability of the network, namely \n\nthe computational power required to mine Bitcoins and the size of the blockchain itself. \n\nIndeed, the computational power dedicated to mining has continued to increase over time \n\nand there are some authors believing that the cost of Bitcoin mining on commodity \n\nhardware now exceeds the value of the rewards (Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nxiii)  Superior competing currency: A superior competing currency could lead to a \n\ncrisis of confidence causing either a collapse of Bitcoin\u2019s value or merely a permanent \n\nreduction of Bitcoin\u2019s value. As stated by Grinberg (2011), Bitcoin has at least two classes \n\nof competitor products, which are products that facilitate internet-based commerce and \n\ngold-backed currencies. The first one can be divided into three sub-types: traditional e-\n\ncommerce, micropayments and the virtual world and game-related commerce. In practice, \n\nthe same author referred that Bitcoin is unlikely to make significant headway in the \n\ntraditional ecommerce market because consumers generally do not care about the kind of \n\nanonymity that Bitcoin provides, prefer to compare prices of most goods and services in \n\na currency they are familiar with and want fraud protection, which Bitcoin currently lacks. \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nHowever, Bitcoin may be specially competitive in the micropayment and virtual world \n\nmarkets, where consumers care less about pricing in a familiar currency. Bitcoin is likely \n\nto be attractive to those who like gold-backed currencies because its value depends on the \n\navailability of a limited resource rather than discretionary actions by central bankers.  \n\nIn the article of Harrel et al (2017), it was also mentioned that as of July 15, 2016, \n\nCoinmarketcap.com listed 656 different cybercurrencies, having a total market \n\ncapitalization of approximately $13.011 billion, where Bitcoin was in the 1st place with \n\n$10.501 billion. \n\nAdditionally, Guadamuz et al (2015) stated that Amazon has announced that it will \n\nbe launching its own virtual currency for their Kindle app store, Amazon Coins.  These \n\nauthors also identified some of the most popular implementations, with some \n\nimprovements relative to Bitcoin, standing out the following ones:  \n\n\u2022 IxCoin: It is the first Bitcoin clone. It was released in 2011 and it can be mined \n\nat the same time as Bitcoin. It also has a limit of 21 million coins, but much shorter mining \n\nperiod (all coins should have been mined in 2015).  \n\n\u2022 Namecoin: It is one of the most innovative altcoins. It uses Bitcoin to create a \n\ndecentralized domain name system outside of the existing international system operated \n\nby ICANN. The service allows the registration of domain names that cannot be shut down \n\nor taken over by law enforcement.  \n\n\u2022 Litecoin: This is one of the more popular Bitcoin alternatives, it was created \n\nspecifically to fix perceived shortcomings in Bitcoin, and it boasts faster transaction \n\nverification times and improved storage efficiency.  \n\n\u2022 Bitcoin XT: This is a very recent and controversial fork to the original Bitcoin \n\nsource code that adds two main changes, the block size is increased and it removes the \n\nneed to download the entire blockchain. \n\n \n\n2.6. Physical versus Digital Currencies \n\nAccording to Allen et al (2016), it is clear that beyond the physical storage of \n\nprecious metals and other financial assets, a bank is a centralized ledger of transactions, \n\nwhether of capital or payments, which records balances between many different parties. \n\nA bank, in the modern sense, is an internalized market: it is an organization that functions \n\nas a platform to match those with excess supply of capital (savers) with those with excess \n\ndemand for capital (borrowers). In sum, banks exist as third party intermediating \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n21 \n \n\norganizations, where the presence of opportunism in many transactions makes hierarchies \n\nand relational contracting more transaction cost efficient mechanisms of governance.  \n\nOn the other hand, the same authors also referred that a blockchain is a public \n\ndecentralized ledger platform and, as a specific technology for digital currencies, it is a \n\ntechnical solution to the double-spending problem. Blockchains are best understood as a \n\nnew institutional technology that makes possible new types of contracts and \n\norganizations. In this sense, blockchains look to have changed the comparative \n\ngovernance efficiencies by eliminating opportunism. Therefore blockchains, as \n\ninstitutional technologies, undermine the strong case for the economic efficiency of \n\nhierarchies and relational contracting over markets. If blockchains can eliminate \n\nopportunism they will, at least theoretically, outcompete traditional organizational \n\nhierarchies and relational contracts. \n\nFurthermore, Bitcoin transactions are irreversible in the same way cash transactions \n\nare irreversible (Grinberg, 2011). \n\n \n\nIn the article of Guadamuz et al (2015), it is mentioned that modern fiat currencies \n\nhave value based on the economic strength of the issuer. In some libertarian and anarchist \n\ncircles, it is said that fiat money does not have any inherent value, but this fails to \n\nrecognize that neither does the gold standard. Gold does not have intrinsic value, under \n\nthe right circumstances gold could be valueless except as an industrial input. In fact, there \n\nis no such thing as inherent value, all value is dependent on circumstances. The value in \n\nfiat money arises from the law, the currency has the support of the government as \n\nsovereign and therefore it is supported by the economy of the territory where it is \n\naccepted.  \n\nOn the contrary, Bitcoin was devised as a non-fiat currency. In other words, its \n\nproponents claim that it has 'real' value. The value arises from computing power, that is, \n\nthe only way to create new coins is by allocating distributed CPU power through \n\ncomputer programs named 'miners'. Another way of looking at the currency is that Bitcoin \n\nis simply allocating value arbitrarily to a program that performs the mathematical \n\nequations necessary to support the creation of a Bitcoin. It is a self-referential and circular \n\ncurrency, and its only value is that which people give it, just like fiat money, but with \n\nfaith placed in computer programming, not sovereign states. \n\nIndeed, the vast majority of currencies are backed by governments (or other legal \n\nentities), commodities, or both. Unlike the U.S. Dollar, Bitcoin is not backed by the U.S. \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\nGovernment or any other legal institution. It is a digital rather than paper currency, \n\nstorable on electronic media and transferable over the internet (Grinberg, 2011). \n\nEven so, a growing ecosystem surrounds Bitcoin, including exchanges, transaction \n\nservices providers, market information and chart providers, escrow providers, joint \n\nmining operations and so on. Additionally, individuals can send Bitcoins for free, but may \n\nadd optional transaction fees to ensure their transactions are quickly processed. By \n\ncontrast, credit card charges can be charged back to merchants. \n\nHowever, absent from this ecosystem at present are futures markets and entities \n\noffering legitimate investment returns, such as fractional reserve banks, although some \n\nindividuals have announced plans to build these (Grinberg, 2011). Harrel et al (2017) also \n\nidentified other Bitcoin issues such as the as the particularly difficult transactional, \n\nregulatory and law enforcement challenges caused by their anonymity due to encryption, \n\ntheir ability to transcend national borders in the fraction of a second and their unique \n\njurisdictional issues. Moreover, in contrast to negotiable instruments, a virtual or \n\ncybercurrency is intangible and potentially ephemeral.  \n\nFurthermore, at present, goods and services priced in Bitcoin units tend to see the \n\nnumber of Bitcoin fluctuate in lock-step with changes in Bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate against \n\na national currency, like the U.S. dollar. If Bitcoin was serving as a true, widely-used unit \n\nof account we would not expect to see such constant fluctuations in the number of Bitcoin \n\nrequired to complete a purchase. Further, Bitcoin is unlikely to become a widely used unit \n\nof account until either its relative volatility decreases and or it becomes more widely used \n\nas a medium of exchange (Hileman, 2015). \n\nIn these regards, Athey et al (2016) added that Bitcoin also shares some features \n\nwith risky assets where beliefs about the future underlying value of the asset evolve over \n\ntime as information is revealed. \n\nIn this sense, it is important to understand, based on the Bitcoin\u2019s characteristics, \n\nwhat \u201csecurity\u201d does it match (if applicable).  \n\nIn fact, Grinberg (2011) developed this topic, comparing Bitcoin with Notes, \n\nStocks, Investment Contracts, Commodities and Currencies. This author concluded that \n\nBitcoin is not a \u201cnote\u201d because it lacks the promise by the maker to pay a sum of money \n\nto another party. Similarly, it is not \u201cstock\u201d since it does not confer the right to receive \n\ndividends contingent upon an apportionment of profits neither vote rights.  \n\nOn the other hand, an investment contract has a broader definition: it is a contract, \n\ntransaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n23 \n \n\nled to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. Given this, \n\nthe author concluded that, because there is likely no common enterprise, Bitcoin is \n\nunlikely to be an investment contract. Indeed, the individuals who choose to promote \n\nBitcoin are independent of one another, and there is no one money-making business that \n\nseeks to raise money through investments. \n\nNext, \u201ccommodities\u201d enter into the discussion. Grinberg (2011) put the hypothesis \n\nthat Bitcoins are commodities, which are generally held not to be securities. Indeed, \n\nowning a Bitcoin gives one only rights to use the Bitcoin in any way one sees fit and to \n\nsell or make contracts involving that Bitcoin. However, decisions explaining why \n\ncommodities are not securities have also noted that commodities are \u201ctangible\u201d and have \n\n\u201cinherent value,\u201d unlike securities. Bitcoins are not \u201ctangible,\u201d and one may argue that \n\nby design they have no inherent value because there is no government or commodity \n\nbacking them. Thus, although Bitcoins share many features with commodities, they also \n\nshare features with securities and are unlikely to evade categorization as an \u201cinvestment \n\ncontract\u201d on this ground. As well, Guadamuz et al (2015) also presented this discussion. \n\nIn fact, these authors mentioned that Bitcoin fulfils all of three security requirements, and \n\ntherefore can easily be classified as such, at least until the law changes to classify it more \n\nadequately. Nevertheless, it would also be easy for Bitcoin to be treated as a commodity \n\nunder the broad definition present in the Commodity Exchange Act 19366. \n\nFinally, only remains the \u201ccurrency\u201d. According to Harrel et al (2017), a functional \n\napproach to the definition of money is based on the observation of the three primary \n\nfunctions: (1) a means of exchange in terms of (2) a defined unit of account that is used \n\nas (3) a measure and store of value. \n\nThe first requirement of a currency is that it can be used for transactions. At this \n\nstage, Carrick (2016) mentioned that there are thousands of websites that accept Bitcoin \n\nand in December of 2015, there were approximately 200.000 daily Bitcoin transactions \n\nper day, but this volume is tiny compared to other currencies. However, there are still \n\nmany smaller recognized currencies that have far less daily volume. Overall, it is unclear \n\nwhether Bitcoin meets the transactional requirement of a currency \u2013 this depends on the \n\ninterpretation of this requirement. \n\nThe second requirement of a currency is that is can be used as a unit of account. \n\nThis is also debatable for Bitcoin. It clearly has unit of account characteristics. First, a \n\n                                                             \n6 An act passed in 1936 by the U.S. Government that provides federal regulation of all futures trading \nactivities. This act replaced the Grain Futures Act of 1922 [35].  \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nBitcoin can be divided into an infinite number of pieces, and these can be put back \n\ntogether to form a full Bitcoin. Second, Bitcoin is fungible since all Bitcoins are created \n\nequally and they can all be interchanged. Third, it is countable and subject to \n\nmathematical operations. Although Bitcoin seems to clearly meet the unit of account \n\nrequirements, there is still debate on this. The debate primarily revolves around Bitcoin\u2019s \n\nability to value goods and services, given its volatility. However, many currencies incur \n\nextreme volatility and are still considered currencies (Carrick, 2016). \n\nThe third requirement of a currency is that it be able to be used as a store value of \n\naccount. Some authors have argued that Bitcoin\u2019s volatility marginalizes its store value. \n\nTo that point, many investors gauge the credibility of a currency by its stability and ability \n\nto be a safe haven when other financial assets are experiencing volatility (Carrick, 2016). \n\nAt this stage, Grinberg (2011) referred that the narrow definition would likely \n\nexclude Bitcoins until Bitcoins become generally accepted in any geographical or \n\npolitical area. This leads to the need for Bitcoin regulation. \n\n \n\n2.7. Bitcoin Regulation \n\nAlthough Bitcoin may be more resistant to government attack because of its \n\ndecentralized nature, many Bitcoin users, including both consumers and businesses, are \n\nanxious about its legal status. As mentioned before, actually Bitcoin operates in a legal \n\ngrey area and one of its problems is the reluctance of regulatory authorities in some \n\ncountries to approve it as a currency (Grinberg, 2011). \n\nA real case descripted in the article of Grinberg (2011) goes back to 1988, when \n\nBernard von NotHaus started printing and distributing metallic and paper currency called \n\nLiberty Dollars. The currency was backed by gold, silver, or other precious metals, and it \n\nwas intended to be inflation-proof, unlike the U.S. Dollar. The U.S. Mint warned \n\nconsumers about the Liberty Dollar in 2006, NotHaus\u2019s offices were raided by the FBI \n\nand Secret Service in 2007 and NotHaus was indicted in 2009 and convicted in March \n\n2011. In press releases related to the indictment and conviction, the Department of Justice \n\nmade several statements that seemed extremely hostile to private currencies. \n\nNevertheless, the statutes under which NotHaus was convicted, 18 U.S. Code \u00a7\u00a7 485 and \n\n486 [48], are inapplicable to Bitcoin because they only deal with metal coins or coins or \n\nbars that resemble official U.S. or foreign currency. Nevertheless, some have mused that \n\nthe attack on Liberty Dollar indicate that Bitcoin will be next. \n\n \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n25 \n \n\nFollowing this issue, there are some points generating the need for Bitcoin \n\nregulation, namely to discourage of anti-money laundering, applying know-your-\n\ncustomer controls, and to minimize misinformation. \n\nMoney laundering is the process by which dirty money, proceeds of illegal \n\nactivities, is rendered clean, allowing the money to be used for legal activities. Terrorist \n\nfinancing is similar, except that it allows clean money to be used for illegal activities, and \n\nis often considered under the same umbrella as money laundering (Grinberg, 2011). The \n\nFinancial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization that designs \n\nand promotes policies and standards to combat money laundering, creating \n\nrecommendations which target is money laundering, terrorist financing and other threats \n\nto the global financial system. As of 2014 there are thirty-six members of the Financial \n\nAction Task Force. Most members are countries, though regional organizations, such as \n\nthe European Commission, are also included. A large number of international \n\norganizations participate in the FATF as observers, each of which has some involvement \n\nin anti-money laundering activities, namely Interpol, the International Monetary Fund \n\n(IMF), Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and World \n\nBank are observers [37]. \n\nDigital currencies are attractive vehicles for money laundering because they allow \n\nfast, anonymous, through-the-Internet transfers. Thus, there is a serious question of \n\nwhether the regulations and regimes in force impose legal risk for the Bitcoin developers, \n\nexchanges, ewallet providers, individual miners, operators of mining pools, mere Bitcoin \n\nusers and businesses that accept Bitcoins (Grinberg, 2011). \n\nAdditionally, like other commonly traded financial assets, information plays a \n\nmajor role in determining the price of Bitcoin, but unlike most other financial assets, the \n\ngovernment cannot minimize the dissemination of misinformation. This has already hurt \n\nBitcoin in the Mt. Gox incident where many false reports of the magnitude and cause of \n\nthe failure were reported (Grinberg, 2011). \n\nDespite these forces, regulators and law enforcement officials face difficult \n\ntechnical challenges in obtaining evidence for law enforcement purposes, e.g., relating to \n\npotential links between crime, sophisticated encryption and virtual currency (Harrel et al, \n\n2017).  \n\nThe flip side to government oversight is that governments could make Bitcoin \n\ninefficient, and even worse in the eyes of Bitcoin\u2019s creators, governments could take it \n\nover and essentially make it a fiat currency. Some legal scholars suggest that there is \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\nmiddle ground, suggesting that governments could take an active role in regulation \n\nwithout taking it over, essentially by taking a role in monitoring Bitcoin markets the way \n\nthey do with stock exchanges (Carrick, 2016). \n\nIn a different note, Guadamuz et al (2015) constructed the following scenarios for \n\nvirtual currencies: \n\ni) \u201cVirtual sovereigns\u201d: virtual currency providers will serve as regulators by \n\nenforcing the terms of their contracts with users to prevent cyber-fraud and ensure proper \n\nbehaviour. \n\nii) Prohibition: governments could try to block their citizens from using virtual \n\ncurrencies that do not abide by government restrictions and regulations (governments \n\nhave not been able to completely block access to websites nor will total prohibition on \n\nvirtual currencies succeed). \n\niii)  Selective prohibition: government minimize the real-world impact of virtual \n\ncurrencies by, for instance, banning the sale of real-world goods for virtual currency. This \n\nsection would also cover the banning and/or criminalization of the use of the currency to \n\npay for illegal activities or for money laundering.  \n\niv)  Selective regulation: regulators impose some restrictions to specific aspects of \n\nvirtual currencies, such as taxation and the regulation of intermediaries.  \n\nv) \u201cReal-world assisted virtual currency self-governance\u201d: governments provide \n\nsupport for mechanisms whereby users of virtual currencies can agree upon and enforce \n\ntheir own \u2018community standards\u2019 and rules of conduct. \n\n \n\nSo far, several authors have mentioned the position of the American regulatory \n\ninstitutions. Grinberg (2011) mentioned the statement of the Department of Justice, in a \n\npress release, that the creation of private coin or currency systems to compete with the \n\nofficial coinage and currency of the United States is a violation of federal law. However, \n\norganizations have been issuing a certain type of private currency in the U.S. for decades. \n\nGovernment officials have known about these currencies and have commented that they \n\nseem to pose no threat. \n\nHarrel et al (2017) also referred that, while the U.S. Government Accountability \n\nOffice (GAO) has observed that there are no legal definitions for a virtual economy or \n\ncurrency, the GAO also has stated that a virtual currency is generally a digital unit of \n\nexchange that is not backed by a government-issued legal tender. On the other hand, the \n\nU.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) defines virtual currency as a \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n27 \n \n\nmedium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments, but does not \n\nhave legal tender status in any jurisdiction. So far, in the United States, the FinCEN only \n\nissued guidelines specified that decentralized currencies should comply with money \n\nlaundering regulations. \n\nIndeed, in the United States, only the U.S. Dollar is legal tender. Similarly, only the \n\nMint and the Federal Reserve can produce coins and currency, which are the only means \n\nof legal tender. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), it is a violation \n\nof federal law for individuals or organizations to create private coin or currency systems \n\nto compete with the official coinage and currency of the United States. It would seem \n\nclear that local currencies that may compete with the dollar are not allowed, but the \n\nquestion of whether Bitcoin can be considered a currency for these purposes is not clear. \n\nOn the contrary, there have been electronic payment systems in existence for over a \n\ndecade and there have not been attempts to curb them by using counterfeiting legislation \n\n(Guadamuz et al, 2015). \n\nAccording to Harrel et al (2017), the Bitcoin Foundation, founded by seven of the \n\ncommunity\u2019s most instrumental individuals, such as Gavin Andresen - a core Bitcoin \n\ndeveloper, has been registered under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code in Washington, \n\nD.C.. Its bylaws were effective as of July 23, 2012. The Foundation is governed by a \n\nboard with five seats split by membership class. Two seats elected by the Individual \n\nmember class, two seats by the Corporate member class and one seat by the Founding \n\nmember class.  \n\nMoreover, the same authors referred that in January 2014, the Uniform Law \n\nCommission (ULC) created a Study Committee on Alternative and Mobile Payments (the \n\nStudy Committee). The focus of the Study Committee is to devise an optimal licensing \n\nsystem for intermediaries that perform financial services for third parties relating to \n\ndigital or virtual currencies. The Study Committee received extensive input from a variety \n\nof sources, including: the American Bankers Association; The Clearing House; the \n\nEuropean Central Bank, the Senate of Canada, Standing Committee on Banking, Trade \n\nand Commerce; and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \n\nAdditionally, one of the major advances in the Bitcoin regulation in the U.S.A. was \n\nalso described by these authors and it had the first step in August 2013, when the New \n\nYork State Department of Financial Services (DFS) announced its inquiry into the \n\nappropriate regulatory guidelines for virtual currencies. The proposal, first published in \n\nthe July 23, 2014 edition of the New York State Register, triggered a series of comment \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\nperiods. The final DFS rule was published in the New York State Register\u2019s June 24, \n\n2015 edition. It may be summarized as including requirements that relate to: anti-money \n\nlaundering issues, consumer protection concerns and cyber security rules. Additionally it \n\nincludes requirements and provisions for Safeguarding Consumer Assets, Virtual \n\nCurrency Receipts, Consumer Complaint Policies, Consumer Disclosures, Anti-money \n\nLaundering Compliance (Verification of Account holders and the Reporting of Suspected \n\nFraud and Illicit Activity), a Cyber Security Program, a Chief Information Security \n\nOfficer, Independent DFS Examinations, Books and Records, Reports and financial \n\nDisclosures, Audit Requirements, Capital Requirements, a Compliance Officer, Business \n\nContinuity and Disaster Recovery, Notification of Emergencies or Disruptions and \n\nprovisions for a Transitional Period.  \n\nFollowing release of the rule, outlining the final DFS BitLicense requirements, the \n\nDFS announced approval of the first BitLicense application on September 22, 2015. \n\n \n\nIn contrast, the situation in Europe and the U.K. is less ambiguous than in the U.S. \n\nThere is considerably more regulatory acceptance for alternative currencies to those \n\nissued by central banks authorities. While Bitcoin is larger by many degrees of magnitude, \n\nthere does not seem to be any indication from regulators and central banking authorities \n\nin Europe that there will be a crackdown on Bitcoin over its legal status (Guadamuz et al, \n\n2015). \n\nOn the other hand, according to Guadamuz et al (2015), there is a high threshold \n\nfor an electronic money institution, as the electronic money institutions (EMI) would have \n\nto fulfil quite a number of requirements. The idea behind this stringent regulation is \n\nevident, as what is taking place is the issuing of value into the economy. If Bitcoins are \n\nnot an EMI in Europe, then their status as currency is in doubt. The European Banking \n\nAuthority (EBA) has opined that virtual currencies do not fulfil many of the requirements \n\nof a currency, and therefore should not be considered legal tender. While it does not state \n\ndirectly, the EBA opinion infers Bitcoin being a commodity that can be exchanged for \n\nfiat money. Despite this, the European Banking Authority issued a report on virtual \n\ncurrencies, as well as a detailed number of possible regulatory responses to the challenges \n\nposed by virtual currencies. However, they are only proposals. \n\nIndeed, Europe has already in place a legal framework for the regulation of \n\nelectronic money, which could be used to cover virtual currencies such as Bitcoin. The \n\nDirective 2009/110/EC, of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n29 \n \n\n2009, contains rules for all sorts of electronic purses that can be used to store value in an \n\nelectronic format, be it via a computer, a mobile device or online. The Directive defines \n\nelectronic money thus: \n\ni) electronically, including magnetically, stored monetary value;  \n\nii) as represented by a claim on the issuer which is issued on receipt of funds for \n\nthe purpose of making payment transactions;  \n\niii)  the transaction is an act, initiated by the payer or by the payee, of placing, \n\ntransferring or withdrawing funds, irrespective of any underlying obligations between the \n\npayer and the payee;  \n\niv)  which is accepted by a natural or legal person other than the electronic money \n\nissuer. \n\nAlso in the U.K., Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) issued a briefing \n\npaper detailing its position on the tax treatment of income received from, and charges \n\nmade in connection with, activities involving Bitcoin and other similar cryptocurrencies. \n\nThe HMRC recognizes that this is an evolving regulatory area and is expecting that at \n\nsome point there will be some sort of EU-wide effort to define and clarify \n\ncryptocurrencies in general. HMRC has decided to treat income from sales of goods and \n\nservices through Bitcoin in the same manner as it does any other sales (Guadamuz et al, \n\n2015). \n\n \n\nFor the rest of the world, Guadamuz et al (2015) referred that China has been the \n\nonly jurisdiction to successfully attempt a major crackdown of Bitcoin. However, it must \n\nbe said that while the Chinese crackdown had some adverse effects on the use of Bitcoin \n\nas a currency, it is still being traded in China and the most active exchange is Chinese. \n\nOn the other hand, Pieters et al (2016), mentioned that in July 2014 Ecuador banned \n\nBitcoin, while the Isle of Mann merely clarified the application of existing tax rules. \n\nLastly, Harrel et al (2017) also stated that during recent months, blockchain \n\ntechnology has continued to gain validation by an announcement of a partnership \n\nincluding nine of the world\u2019s largest banks, proof of a concept experiment by Bank of \n\nCanada and an announcement that a Chinese digital currency will be issued as soon as \n\npossible. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\n2.8. Theories, Studies and Conclusions \n\nThe article of Cheung et al (2015) was based on the development of Phillips, Shi &amp; \n\nYu (2013) methodology, a procedure designed to detect stochastic of a given time series \n\nbecause such explosive behaviour is usually deemed as a key feature of a bubble. The \n\nselected data was daily Bitcoin prices over the period 17th July 2010 to 18th February \n\n2014, collected from the www.bitcoincharts.com website, for the Mt. Gox Exchange. \n\nTheir results showed a number of short-lived bubbles but most importantly, they found \n\nthree huge bubbles in the latter part of the period (2011-2013) lasting from 66 to 106 days \n\nthe last of which led to the demise of the Mt. Gox exchange. The bursting of these bubbles \n\nalso seems to coincide with certain major events that occurred in the Bitcoin market. \n\nTherefore, this supports the theory that Bitcoin has been in a bubble over its relatively \n\nshort existence.  \n\nIn a different approach, Chan et al (2015) published another study about Bitcoin. \n\nTheir work was based on the statistical analysis of the exchange rate of Bitcoin. Their \n\nmain objective was to provide a formal statistical analysis of the exchange rate of Bitcoin \n\nversus the USD using a wide range of known parametric distributions in finance. The data \n\nused was daily Bitcoin Exhange Rate on Bitstamp (Bitcoin versus USD) from the 13th of \n\nSeptember 2011 to the 8th of May 2014. With this information, it was possible to plot the \n\nlog-returns of the exchange rate of Bitcoin and to estimate its range, mean, skewness, \n\nkurtosis, standard deviation, variance, coefficient of variance and other statistics. Through \n\nAutocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation functions, the authors analysed what \n\ndistribution is better to represent the behaviour of the Bitcoin\u2019s exchange rate to the USD. \n\nThere were considered fifteen of the most popular parametric distributions in finance. The \n\ndistributions were fitted to the selected data and they were compared by their log-\n\nlikelihoods and five criteria \u2013 the Akaike Information, the Bayesian Information, the \n\nconsistent Akaike Information, the corrected Akaike Information and the Hannan-Quinn \n\ncriterion.  \n\nOverall, the result was that the generalized hyperbolic distribution gives the best fit, \n\nin opposite to the normal distribution which gives the worst fit. Through the distribution \n\nthat better describes the exchange rate behaviour, the authors predicted the log-returns of \n\nthe exchange-rate based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES). \n\nTheir conclusions were that the log-returns will be greater than 2,282\u00d710-1 with 1 percent \n\nchance and will be less than -2,043\u00d710-1 with 1 percent chance. For 0,1 percent chance, \n\nvalues will be greater and less than 4,539\u00d710-1 and -4,108\u00d710-1, respectively.  \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n31 \n \n\nThe major lack of this analysis was to not consider the impact of volatility, this is, \n\nhow the past volatility of returns impacts on the current volatility. Actually, one of \n\nconclusions from the study developed by Baek et al (2015) was that Bitcoins are 26 times \n\nmore volatile than the S&amp;P 500 Index. These authors based their study on Bitcoin daily \n\nprices ($US) from July 2010 to February 2014, downloaded from www.bitcoinch-\n\narts.com.  \n\nThe article written by Gouri\u00e9roux et al (2015) takes this in consideration. The \n\nauthors, similarly to Cheung et al (2015), recognize the presence of local trends and short-\n\nlived episodes of soaring XBT/USD rates, followed by sudden almost vertical declines. \n\nIn this context, the objective of their study was to examine the dynamics of the XBT/USD \n\nexchange rate and to predict its future evolution. Due to the presence of local explosive \n\ntrends, depicted as bubbles, the XBT/USD exchange rate cannot be modelled by any \n\ntraditional ARIMA or ARCH models (Gouri\u00e9roux et al, 2015).  \n\nThen, it was used the mixed causal-noncausal autoregressive process with Cauchy \n\nerrors. They selected 150 observations on the daily closing values of the XBT/USD \n\nexchange rate over the period 20th February 2013 and 20th July 2013, since that includes \n\na bubble, which bursted on April 10, 2013. The series of Bitcoin/USD exchange rates has \n\nbeen used as a playground for analysing the relevance of the causal-noncausal modelling \n\nto capture bubble phenomena, since it was typically an example of highly speculative \n\nemerging market. Indeed, when they applied the methodology, speculative bubbles \n\nappeared in that period.  \n\nIn conclusion, Gouri\u00e9roux et al (2015) mentioned that, given that recently several \n\nexchange platforms have closed, temporarily or definitely, there is clearly a need of \n\nsupervision to better protect the investors against theft of their Bitcoins, but also against \n\nthe speculative behaviour of large Bitcoin holders. This supervision will likely make \n\ndisappear the previously observed speculative bubbles and perhaps the market for this \n\nelectronic currency itself.  \n\nNonetheless, if Bitcoin usage grows, then it is expected Bitcoin volatility to drop \n\nand attract market and economic influence representing a more balanced internally and \n\nexternally driven investments vehicle (Baek et al, 2015).  \n\nOn this subject, Urquhart (2016) identified some arguments published, namely by \n\nCheah et al (2015) arguing that if Bitcoin were a true unit, account or a form of store of \n\nvalue, it would not display such volatility expressed by bubbles and crashes. Dwyer \n\n(2014) found that the average monthly volatility of Bitcoin is higher than that for gold or \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\na set of foreign currencies, and the lowest monthly volatilities for Bitcoin are less than \n\nthe highest monthly volatility for gold and currencies. Dyhrberg (2016) showed that \n\nBitcoin has similar hedging capabilities as gold and the dollar, and as such can be \n\nemployed for risk management. Still, Cheah et al (2015) developed an econophyscis \n\nmodel to reveal that Bitcoin and Ripple (another cryptocurrency) are characterized by \n\nnegative bubbles. \n\nOn the other hand, Urquhart (2016) also stated that the efficient market hypothesis \n\n(EMH) is one the key cornerstones of finance. A market is efficient if prices fully reflect \n\nall available information. Three forms of efficiency can be distinguished with the most \n\ncommonly examined form the weak form, where a market is said to be weak form \n\nefficient if investors cannot use past information to predict future returns.  \n\nTherefore, the author developed a study to test the efficiency of Bitcoin. The study \n\nwas based on data collected from www.bitcoinaverage.com, which is the first aggregated \n\nBitcoin price index that aggregates rates from all available Bitcoin exchanges around the \n\nworld and provides a volume weighted average Bitcoin price. The data consisted of daily \n\nclosing prices for Bitcoin in USD from 1st August 2010 to 31st July 2016. Several tests \n\nwere carried out emphasizing: (i) it was examined the autocorrelation of returns, which \n\nare assessed via the Ljung-Box test; (ii) the runs test (Wald &amp; Wolowitz, 1940) and the \n\nBartels test were employed to determine whether returns are independent; (iii) test if \n\nprices are predictable, employing the variance ratio test (Lo &amp; MacKinlay, 1988); and \n\n(iv) the BDS test was employed to test the serial dependence in prices returns.  \n\nSumming up, the full sample was split into two subsamples and the results show \n\nthat Bitcoin is an inefficient market over full sample period but appears to becoming less \n\ninefficient in the second subsample period. The analysis shows that the Bitcoin market is \n\nnot weakly efficient over the full sample period. However, the author shows that Bitcoin \n\nmay becoming more efficient with some of the tests for market efficiency suggesting that \n\nBitcoin returns are random in the second subsample. Since it is a relatively new \n\ninvestment asset and still in its infancy, it is similar to an emerging market and therefore \n\nthe inefficiency finding is not surprising. Consistent with this argument is that Bitcoin \n\nwill become more efficient over time as more investors analyse and trade Bitcoin. \n\n \n\nCarrick (2016) also explored the Bitcoin volatility. The author considered the \n\nperiod from 1st January 2011 to 31st December 2015. Through descriptive statistics and \n\nthe correlation matrix, based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, of the major \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n33 \n \n\ncurrencies and Bitcoin, Carrick performed the comparisons between: (i) Bitcoin relative \n\nvalue and volatility to the major currencies of the world; (ii) Bitcoin relative value and \n\nvolatility to commonly traded emerging market currencies; and (iii) Bitcoin returns and \n\nthe returns from an emerging market currency basket electronically exchange traded fund \n\n(ETF). \n\nThe conclusion was that, with the exception of the CNY, all of the emerging \n\ncurrencies are correlated at statistically significant levels. Conversely, it shows that \n\nBitcoin is negatively correlated at statistically significant levels with all of the currencies, \n\nexcept the CNY. This is an interesting finding as currency risk is a major issue with \n\nemerging market currencies, but emerging market currencies have become a common \n\nway to diversify risk and balance both currency portfolios and general investment \n\nportfolios. Thus, because of the negative correlation of Bitcoin and most of the emerging \n\nmarkets currencies, it could fit in well in emerging market currency portfolios to offset \n\nrisk. Although the analysis performed in the present study high-lighted Bitcoin\u2019s \n\nvolatility, Bitcoin can still be a good means of conducting transactions. This is because \n\nBitcoins can be instantaneously exchanged into other currencies. Thus, the volatility of \n\nBitcoin can almost be eliminated. \n\n \n\nOne of the most recent studies was published by Balcilar et al (2017) in order to \n\naddress the research gap on the Bitcoin volume-return paradigm. Therefore, the authors \n\nused a nonparametric causality-in-quantiles test, developed by themselves, to examine \n\nthe predictability of Bitcoin returns and volatility based on trading volume. It was \n\nconsidered the daily data covering the period of 19th December 2011 to 25th April 2016. \n\nThe test has three main innovations: (i) the approach is robust to misspecification \n\nerrors as it detects the underlying dependence structure across the variables under study; \n\n(ii) the methodology allows for the detection of not only the causality-in-mean but also \n\nfor any potential causality in the tails of the joint distribution of the variables; and (iii) the \n\nnonparametric causality-in-quantiles approach allows to examine causality-in-variance \n\nand, thus, study higher-order dependency. Such an investigation is important because \n\nduring some periods, causality in the conditional-mean may not exist, while, at the same \n\ntime, higher-order interdependencies may turn out to be significant. \n\nIn this study, the authors used two variables, namely, the Bitcoin index and the \n\ntrading volume, as measures of the level of trading activity.  \n\nThereby, the authors\u2019 main results are summarized as follows: \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\ni) The standard linear Granger causality test, which was conducted for comparison \n\npurposes, fails to detect any evidence of volume causing returns; \n\nii) The nonlinearity test indicates that returns and their relationship with volume \n\nevolve in a nonlinear manner. Additionally, tests of multiple structural breaks show \n\nevidence of regime changes in returns and in the equation relating them to volume. \n\nEvidence of nonlinearity and structural breaks suggests that the linear Granger causality \n\nis misspecified, thus, leading to unreliable results. \n\niii)  The causality-in-quantiles approach, which emerges as a suitable choice given \n\nevidence of non-linearity, structural breaks, and fat tails, reveals that the null that volume \n\ndoes not Granger cause returns is rejected at the conventional levels of significance over \n\nthe quantile range of 0,25 to 0,75 of the conditional distribution of returns. \n\nHowever, the authors fail to reject the null that volume does not Granger cause \n\nvolatility over the entire conditional distribution. The results show that volume can \n\npredict returns, but not volatility, with causality for returns non-existent in bearish (lower \n\nquantiles) and bullish (upper quantiles) phases.  \n\nTo conclude, Balcilar et al (2017) stated that when the market is performing around \n\nthe normal (median) mode, volume can indeed predict returns, by providing investors in \n\nthe Bitcoin market with valuable predictive information. However, when the market is \n\nbehaving well or poorly, all that matters for predicting future returns is past values and so \n\ninformation about volume is irrelevant. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n35 \n \n\n3. Data \n\nAs it was mentioned before, one of the main goals of this dissertation is to \n\nunderstand how the Bitcoin\u2019s prices are related in the long term with financial and \n\neconomic data and also the physical currencies main drivers of Bitcoin\u2019s prices (XBT), \n\nrelating them with financial and economic data known to have some relationship with \n\nphysical currencies.  \n\nSince the U.S. Dollar is commonly known as the most traded currency in the world, \n\nthe study support base will be the exchange rate XBT/USD [40]. Its daily quotations are \n\navailable in the Bloomberg platform since 1st January 2013 [62], based on the BGNL \n\npricing source. Due to this, this will be the first observation date for all the collected data.  \n\nIn order to analyse if the Bitcoin quotations have a long term relationship with \n\nfinancial and economic data, in this study it will be considered the following variables: \n\nthe price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil; the gold price; the 6-\n\nmonth and 10-year U.S. Treasury Yields and the S&amp;P 500 Index. The reasons for \n\nincluding these variables in this study are explained below. \n\nIn terms of physical currencies, there are several studies analysing the relations \n\nbetween exchange rates, commodities, interest rates and stock prices.  \n\nIn terms of commodities, Ameur et al (2016) concluded that there is a negative \n\nrelationship between the U.S. Dollar/Euro returns and oil returns, which means that a U.S. \n\nDollar appreciation tend to result in a drop in oil prices. The authors resorted to the price \n\nper barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, whereby this variable will be also \n\nconsidered in this study. \n\nOn the other hand, Dyhrberg (2016) performed a GARCH volatility analysis \n\nbetween Bitcoin, gold and the Dollar, showing that Bitcoin has many behaviour \n\nsimilarities to both gold and the Dollar. So, the gold price will be also considered in this \n\ndissertation. \n\nAnother variable whose relation with exchange rates has been studied by several \n\nauthors is the yield curve, namely, government bond yields. Bal?i?nas et al (2015) \n\ndeveloped a research to explain how 2-year and 10-year U.S. and German government \n\nbond yields can determine the EUR/USD exchange rate in the short run. After estimating \n\nthe linear regression, it was shown that the model can determine 5 per cent of the daily \n\nEUR/USD fluctuations. It affects the exchange rate as it is stated in the uncovered interest \n\nrate parity model \u2013 when the yield increases, the USD tend to decline against the Euro \n\nand vice versa. Another finding is that an increase in the German 10-year government \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\nbond yield tend to increase the price of the euro and the increase in the U.S. 10-year debt \n\nyield leads to an appreciation of the USD. In this sense, it will be collected the 6-month \n\nand 10-year U.S. Treasury Yields, in order to include a short-term and a long-term interest \n\nrate.  \n\nRegarding to the relationship between exchange rates and stock prices, Wong \n\n(2017) developed a study examining the relationship between real exchange rate returns \n\nand real stock price returns in Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Korea, Japan, United \n\nKingdom and Germany. The constant conditional correlation or dynamic conditional \n\ncorrelation - multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity \n\n(MGARCH) model showed that real exchange rate return and real stock price return are \n\nfound to be negative and the estimated coefficients are statistically significant for \n\nMalaysia, Singapore, Korea and the U.K. whereas to be insignificant relationship for the \n\nPhilippines, Japan and Germany.  \n\nBased on these two studies, it will be included the daily quotations of the S&amp;P 500 \n\nIndex. \n\nResuming, this study will consider the exchange rate XBT/USD and five other \n\nvariables: the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil (CL1:COM); \n\nthe gold price (GC1:COM); the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yield (USGG6M); 10-year U.S. \n\nTreasury Yield (USGG10YR) and the S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX:IND). All the prices are \n\nexpressed in U.S. Dollar and the yields in percentages. All data were collected for the \n\nperiod between 1st January 2013 and 28th August 2017 and, therefore, the number of \n\nobservations for each time series is 1.701. All the time series observations are graphically \n\nrepresented in the appendixes A to F.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n37 \n \n\n4. Methodology under cointegration \n\nIn order to understand if the Bitcoin\u2019s prices are related in the long term with the \n\nselected variables, it will be performed a cointegration test. Engle &amp; Granger (1987) \n\nstated that it is frequently of interest to test whether a set of variables are cointegrated, \n\nbecause of the econometric implications such as whether some system is in equilibrium \n\nin the long run. Indeed, the term cointegration was defined by these authors as a \n\nformulation of the phenomenon that nonstationary processes can have linear \n\ncombinations that are stationary (Johansen, 2014).  \n\nThis chapter briefly outlines the econometric specifications and cointegration \n\nprocedures applied to the data mentioned before, starting by the nonstationarity issue.  \n\n \n\n4.1. Nonstationarity \n\nAccording to Tsay (2010), the basis of time series analysis is stationarity. A time \n\nseries {??} is said to be strictly stationary if the joint distribution of (??1 , \u2026 , ???) is \n\nidentical to that of (??1+? , \u2026 , ???+? ) for all t and ?, where the parameters which \n\ncharacterize the distribution of the process depend on the lag ?. This means it requires that \n\nthe joint distribution of (??1 , \u2026 , ??? ) is invariant under time shift, what is hard to verify \n\nbecause it is defined in terms of the distribution function.  \n\nConsequently, the concept of stationarity defined in terms of the moments is \n\ncommonly preferred. Actually, Tsay (2010) mentioned that the process {?? } is said to be \n\nweak stationary if the mean and variance of ??  are constant and the covariance between \n\n??  and ????  are time-invariant, where ? is an arbitrary integer. The weak stationarity is \n\nalso known as second-order, wide-sense or covariance stationary. The same author also \n\nexplained that the weak stationarity implies that the time plot of the data would show the \n\nT values fluctuating with constant variation around a fixed level, where T is the \n\nobservations number.  \n\nBy consequence of the previous definitions, if ??  is strictly stationary and its first \n\ntwo moments are finite, then ??  is also weakly stationary. This is why Tsay (2010) \n\nreferred that the second-order stationarity is the most commonly used form of stationarity.  \n\nIndeed, Tsay (2010) stated that, in some studies, interest rates, foreign exchange \n\nrates or the price series of an asset tend to be nonstationary. For a price series, the \n\nnonstationarity, also called unit-root nonstationary time series, is mainly due to the fact \n\nthat there is no fixed level for the price.  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nBefore enter into the unit root test, it is important to note that we may be in the \n\npresence of structural breaks in the time series under analysis in this study. Actually, \n\nlooking to the Chart 1 in the appendix A, it is possible to observe some changes in the \n\nexchange rate XBT/USD behaviour, namely in the end of 2013, where it seems to occur \n\na sharp \u2018fast\u2019 increase in the level of the series.  \n\nPerron (2005) developed a study about the interplay between structural change and \n\nunit root and how to differentiate between them. The author referred that, for example, \n\nallowing for structural breaks in many financial time series reduces considerably the \n\nestimates of the long-memory parameters within regimes. The working paper conclusions \n\nalso mentioned that the econometrics and statistics literatures do not provide reliable tools \n\nto answer to questions such as if the reductions are statistically significant, if they can \n\nimply the process as being of a short-memory nature within regimes or if there is \n\nsignificant evidence of structural changes.  \n\nAlthough this limitation, it will be performed the Breakpoint Unit Root Test offered \n\nby the EViews, which allows to test a model for data with a one-time break [23].  \n\nThis test consists in a modified augmented Dickey-Fuller test, based in the Perron \n\nmethodology (2005), whose explanation follows.  \n\nThe breaks can be characterized as an intercept break, a trend break or a one-time \n\nbreak. Like this, the following variables allow us to characterize the breaks, defined in \n\nterms of a specified break date Tb and where l(.) is an indicator function that takes the \n\nvalue one if the argument (.) is true, and zero if not.  \n\n? Intercept break variable \u2013 it takes the value zero for all dates prior to the break, \n\notherwise one.  \n\n??? (?? ) = ?(? ? ?? )       (1) \n\n \n\n? Trend break variable \u2013 it takes the value zero for all dates prior to the break and \n\nit is a break date re-based trend for all subsequent dates. \n\n???(?? ) = ?(? ? ?? ). (? ? ?? + 1)     (2) \n\n \n\n? One-time break dummy variable \u2013 it takes the value one on the break date, \n\notherwise zero. \n\n??(?? ) = ?(? = ?? )       (3) \n\n \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n39 \n \n\nThe test considers four different basic models, one for non-trending data and three \n\nfor trending data. Additionally, the EViews offers two versions for each model that differ \n\nin their treatment of the break dynamics: the innovation outlier model and the additive \n\noutlier model.  \n\nThe Innovational outlier model assumes that the break occurs gradually, with the \n\nbreaks following the same dynamic path as the innovations, while the Additive outlier \n\nmodel assumes the breaks occur immediately. Since the break dynamics is not known, \n\nwe performed the tests considering both options, where the conclusions were the same. \n\nTherefore, we will only present the test output considering the Innovational Outlier \n\nmodel. The following equations describe the tests hypothesis, the test equation and the \n\nfour models equations for each trend and break behavior. \n\n? Null hypothesis \n\n?? = ???1 + ? + ?(?)(???(?? ) + ????(?? ) + ?? )    (4) \n\nwhere ??  are independent and identically distributed innovations and ?(?) is a lag \n\npolynomial representing the dynamics of the stationary and invertible ARMA error \n\nprocess. The break variables enter the model with the same dynamics as the ??  \n\ninnovations. \n\n \n\n? Alternative hypothesis \u2013 It assumes a trend stationary model with breaks in the \n\nintercept and trend, with the breaks again following the innovation dynamics. \n\n?? = ? + ?? + ?(?)(????(?? ) + ????(?? ) + ?? )     (5) \n\n \n\n? Dickey-Fuller test equation \u2013 It nests the null and the alternative hypotheses and \n\nuse the t-statistic for comparing ??? to 1 (????) to evaluate the null. Similarly to the \n\nconventional Dickey-Fuller unit root test equations, the k lagged differences of the y are \n\nincluded in the test equations to eliminate the effect of the error correlation structure on \n\nthe asymptotic distribution of the statistic. The ?, ?, ? and ? are the trend, trend break, \n\nintercept break and break dummy coefficients, respectively. This equation corresponds to \n\nthe 29th equation presented in the working paper of Perron (2005). \n\n?? = ? + ?? + ???? (?? ) + ????(?? ) + ???(?? ) + ????1 + ? ??????? + ??\n?\n?=1   (6) \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\n? Model 1: Non-trending data with intercept break \u2013 This model sets the trend (?) \n\nand trend break (?) coefficients to zero, testing a random walk against a stationary model \n\nwith intercept break. \n\n?? = ? + ???? (?? ) + ???(?? ) + ????1 + ? ??????? + ??\n?\n?=1    (7) \n\n \n\n? Model 2: Trending data with intercept break \u2013 This model sets the trend break \n\ncoefficient (?) to zero, testing a random walk with drift against a trend stationary model \n\nwith intercept break. \n\n?? = ? + ?? + ???? (?? ) + ???(?? ) + ????1 + ? ??????? + ??\n?\n?=1   (8) \n\n \n\n? Model 3: Trending data with intercept break and trend break \u2013 This model has no \n\nrestrictions and it tests a random walk with drift against a trend stationary model with \n\nintercept and trend break. \n\n?? = ? + ?? + ???? (?? ) + ????(?? ) + ???(?? ) + ????1 + ? ??????? + ??\n?\n?=1  (6) \n\n \n\n? Model 4: Trending data with trend break \u2013 This model has no restrictions and it \n\ntests a random walk with drift against a trend stationary model with intercept and trend \n\nbreak. \n\n?? = ? + ?? + ????(?? ) + ????1 + ? ?? ????? + ??\n?\n?=1     (9) \n\n \n\nIn the EViews, when computing the Breakpoint Unit Root Test, we may choose \n\nbetween the four trend specifications described by each model. In this section, we will \n\nselect the model with no restrictions (Model 3), corresponding to the Intercept and Trend \n\nfor both Basic and Breaking dropdown menus. Therefore, the test will evaluate the breaks \n\nin the intercept and trend and we will be able to interpret what breaks are identified \n\nthrough the p-value for each one.  \n\nThe test also requires to choose the number of lag terms in the Dickey-Fuller \n\nequations k. The EViews allows us to choose between Akaike Criterion (AIC), Schwarz \n\nCriterion (SC), Hannan-Quinn Criterion (HQC), Modified Akaike, Modified Schwarz, \n\nHannan-Quinn, t-statistic, F-statistic and Fixed lag specifications. At this stage we will \n\nselect the Schwarz Criterion (SC) which penalizes more the complex models. Indeed, \n\nBeal et al (1994) performed a comparison of the Akaike Information Criterion, the \n\nSchwarz Criterion and the F Test as guides to model selection, concluding that when the \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n41 \n \n\ncompeting models are very similar or when the design is inadequate, the F test has a \n\nstrong tendency to choose the simpler model, even when the more complex model is \n\ncorrect. Additionally, Koehler et al (1988) showed that the Schwarz Criterion is a better \n\ncriterion for applications, when compared to the Akaike Information which leads to \n\noverparameterisation since AIC will frequently choose higher order models for empirical \n\ndata.  \n\nIn the Breakpoint Selection section we need to choose the method for determining \n\nthe breakpoint date. For models with an intercept and trend break, we can decide between \n\nminimizing the t-statistic for ? in the ADF test (Dickey-Fuller min-t), minimizing the t-\n\nstatistic for the intercept break coefficient (Intercept break min-t), maximizing the t-\n\nstatistic for the break coefficient (Intercept break max-t), maximizing the absolute value \n\nof the t-statistic for the intercept break coefficient (Intercept break max-abs-t), or \n\nproviding a specific date (User-specified). In this study, we will select the Dickey-Fuller \n\nmin-t, since it selects the break date providing the most evidence against the null \n\nhypothesis of a unit root and in favor of the breaking trend alternative hypothesis.  \n\nAlthough the Eviews allows to compute the test using the raw data (Level) or \n\ndifferences of the original data (1st difference or 2nd difference), in this study we will start \n\nby testing for unit root in \u201cLevel\u201d since the proposal is to use the stationarity of the \n\noriginal data to cointegrate the variables. Therefore, if all the time series has unit root, we \n\nneed to recompute the test in \u201c1st differences\u201d of the original data to conclude if the all \n\nthe time series are nonstationary and integrated of the same order. If so, we can proceed \n\nwith tests of cointegration. \n\nAll the options selected for the Breakpoint Unit Root Test performed for each \n\nvariable are presented in the appendix G.  \n\n \n\n4.2. Cointegration and VEC Model \n\nThe proposal of this study is to understand if the Bitcoin\u2019s prices are related in the \n\nlong term with the selected variables. Therefore, it will be performed a cointegration test. \n\nAccording to Fabozzi et al (2007), two or more processes are said to be cointegrated \n\nif they stay close to each other even if they drift as individual processes. In this context, \n\nthe authors stated that the cointegration can be understood in terms of its three key \n\nfeatures, as follows: \n\n\n\n42 \n\n \n\ni) Reduction of order of integration: Two or more stochastic processes that are \n\nintegrated of order one or higher are said to be cointegrated if there are linear \n\ncombinations of the processes with a lower order of integration. \n\nii) Regression: Two or more processes integrated of order one are said to be \n\ncointegrated if it is possible to make a meaningful linear regression of one process on the \n\nother(s). \n\niii) Common trends: Given n processes with r cointegrating relationships, it is \n\npossible to determine n-r common trends. Common trends are integrated processes such \n\nthat any of the n original processes can be expressed as a linear regressions on the \n\ncommon trends. \n\nThese processes will be tested through the Johansen Test, based on a Vector \n\nAutoregressive (VAR) object, which can be computed in the EViews program [63]. \n\nEViews implemented this VAR-based cointegration test [22] according to the \n\nmethodology developed by Johansen (1991, 1995). According to Johansen et al (1990) \n\nand Johansen (1991, 1995), both synthetized by Pacheco (2010) and Curto (2013), this \n\nmethodology consists of the following: \n\nConsidering that ?? = (?1? , ?2? , \u2026 , ??? )? is a k-vector of nonstationary I(1) \n\nvariables, ??  has been generated by an unrestricted VAR of order p in the level of the \n\nvariables: \n\n?? = ?1???1 + ?2???2 + ? + ?? ???? + ??? + ?? ,     (10) \n\nwith t = 1, \u2026, T, where ?1, ?2, \u2026 , ?? and ? are matrices of coefficients to be \n\nestimated and ?? is a vector of innovations.  \n\nThe VAR system of equations written in error correction form is: \n\n??? = ? + ?1????1 + ?2????2 + ? + ???1?????+1 + ?????? + ?? ,  (11) \n\nwhere ? is the first difference operator and  \n\n?? = ?1 + ?2 + ? + ?? ? ?, for ? = 1, 2, \u2026 , ? ? 1, ? = ? ??\n?\n?=1 ? ?. \n\n \n\nHence, ? is the long run \u2018level solution\u2019 for the VAR model. Therefore, if ??  is a \n\nvector of I(1) variables, the elements ?1????1, ?2 ????2 , \u2026 , ???1?????+1 are I(0) and the \n\nlast element is a linear combination of I(1) variables. If the variables are cointegrated, this \n\nlast element must also be I(0). From here, either ??  contains a number of cointegration \n\nvectors or ? must be a matrix of zeros. The rank of ?, r, determines how many linear \n\ncombinations of ??  are stationary. If r = k, the variables in levels are stationary. If r = 0, \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n43 \n \n\nthen ? = 0 and none of the linear combinations are stationary. When 0 &lt;r &lt;k, there exists \n\nr cointegration vectors or r stationary linear combinations of ?? . Here, it is possible to \n\nfactorize ?: ? ? = ???, where both ? and ? are (? \u00d7 ?) matrices and  ? and ? contain \n\nthe factor loadings and the cointegration vectors, respectively.  \n\nThis methodology includes two asymptotically equivalent tests described by \n\nJohansen (1991, 1995): the Trace test and the Maximum Eigenvalue test. The \n\ncointegration test is calculated by looking at the rank of the ? matrix through its \n\neigenvalues (characteristic roots). The rank of a matrix is equal to the number of its \n\neigenvalues that are different from zero. So the eigenvalues (?? ) are sorted in ascending \n\norder ?1 ? ?2 ? ? ? ??. If the ?\u2019s are roots, then they must be less than one in absolute \n\nvalue and positive, and ?1 will be the largest while ?? will be the smallest, that is, the \n\nclosest to one and zero, respectively. If there is no cointegration between the variables, \n\nthe rank of ? will not be significantly different from zero, so ?? ? 0, ??. Actually, the test \n\nstatistics incorporate ln (1 ? ?? ) rather than ?? , however when ?? = 0, ln(1 ? ??) = 0.  \n\nThe Trace and the Maximum Eigenvalue tests for cointegration under the Johansen \n\napproach are the following: \n\n?????? (?) = ?? ? ln (1 ? ????)\n?\n?=?+1  and      (12) \n\n???? (?, ? + 1) = ??ln (1 ? ??+1?) ,      (13) \n\nwhere r is the number of cointegrated vectors under the null hypothesis and ???? is the i-th \n\nordered eigenvalues estimates from the ?  matrix. Likewise, the larger is the ????, the larger \n\nand negative will be the ln (1 ? ????) and the larger will be the test value. A significantly \n\ndifferent from zero eigenvalue directs to a significant cointegrating vector.  \n\nRegarding the distinction between the two tests, the Trace test is a joint test where \n\nthe null is that the number of cointegrating vectors is lower or equal to r against the \n\nalternative of existence of more than r. It starts with g eigenvalues and, then, successively \n\nthe largest is removed. If all the ?? = 0,  ?????? (?) = 0, for ? = 1, 2, \u2026 , ?. \n\nOn the other hand, the Maximum Eigenvalue test conducts separate tests on each \n\neigenvalue and its null hypothesis is that the number of cointegrating vectors is r against \n\nan alternative of ? + 1. \n\nMoreover, Johansen et al (1990), as referred by Pacheco (2010) also consider that \n\nthe distribution of the test statistics is non-standard and the critical values depend on the \n\nvalue of ? ? ?, the number of nonstationary components and whether constants are \n\nincluded in each equation. Thereby, if the test statistic if greater than the critical value \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nfrom Johansen\u2019s output, reject the null that there are ? + 1 or more than r, for ??????  and \n\n???? , respectively. The test follows a sequence and under the null, for ? = 0, 1, \u2026 , ? ?\n\n1, being the hypothesis for ???? : \n\n?? : ? = 0, otherwise ?1: 0 &lt;? ? ? \n\n?? : ? = 1, otherwise ?1: 1 &lt;? ? ? \n\n?                                                             ? \n\n?? : ? = ? ? 1, otherwise ?1: ? = ? \n\n \n\nThe first one tests the existence of no cointegrating vectors, that is, ? having zero \n\nrank. If the null is not rejected, it will be concluded that there are no cointegrating vectors \n\nand the test will be completed. However, if it is rejected, the null that there is one \n\ncointegrating vector (?? : ? = 1) will be tested and so on, increasing the r value until the \n\nnull is no longer rejected. \n\nIf ? is full rank (g) this will correspond to the original series ??  being stationary. If \n\n? has zero rank, then in the univariate case ???  depends only on ?????, and not on ????? \n\n(there is no long run relationship between the elements of ???? ). Then, there is no \n\ncointegration. For 1 &lt;????(?) &lt;?, there are r cointegrating vectors. Therefore, ? is \n\ndefined as the product of the matrices ? and ? of dimension (? \u00d7 ?) and (? \u00d7 ?), \n\nrespectively: ? = ???. Here, the matrix ? gives the cointegrating vectors and the matrix \n\n? the amount of each cointegrating vector for each equation of the VEC Model (equation \n\n11), also known as the adjustment parameters.  \n\nAdditionally, Pacheco (2010) also clarifies that the Vector Error Correction Model \n\n(VECM) can be interpreted, for example, as a relationship between prices and returns in \n\na specified market. That is, the current returns or price changes are a linear function of \n\nprevious returns or price changes and historical prices. This historical prices form a long \n\nrun relationship, where the included variables co-move over time independently of the \n\nexistence of stochastic trends in each of them, meaning that their difference is stable. At \n\nthis stage, the long run residual measure the distance of the system to equilibrium at each \n\nmoment t, which may due to the impossibility of the economic agents to adjust \n\ninstantaneously to new information or to the short run dynamics also present in the data. \n\nThen, it is important to note that the variables cointegration includes a complex \n\nadjustment process involving short-run and long-run dynamics.  \n\n \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n45 \n \n\nConsidering the previous notes, in order to perform the Johansen Cointegration test \n\nwe need to choose the optimum lag number of VAR representation as well which trend \n\nassumption to use.  \n\nThe optimum lag number of VAR representation was determined using information \n\ncriteria. Similarly to the selection of the number of lag terms in the Dickey-Fuller \n\nequations (see section 4.1.), we will select to the VAR system lag number based on the \n\nSchwarz Criterion (SC), which penalizes more the complex models. \n\nRegarding to the trend assumption considered in the test, since we are not certain \n\nwhich trend assumption to use, it is possible to choose the \u2018Summary of all 5 trend \n\nassumptions\u2019 Eviews option. This will indicate the number of cointegrating relations \n\nunder each of the five trend assumptions. To choose between the five trend assumptions, \n\nwe can use the information matrices based on Log Likelihood (LL), Akaike Information \n\n(AIC) and Schwarz information Criteria (SC). Once again, we will give preference to the \n\nSchwarz criteria.  \n\n \n\n4.3. Exogeneity \n\nDwivedi (2015) mentioned that economic variables are also classified as \n\nendogenous and exogenous variables, where an endogenous variable is one whose value \n\nis determined within the model under analysis while an exogenous variable is determined \n\noutside the model.  \n\nPacheco (2010) explained these concepts, exemplifying with two variables ?? and \n\n?? . Supposing we regress ??  on ??, we say that ?? is weakly exogenous if ??  also does not \n\nexplain ??. On the other hand, ?? is said to be strongly exogenous if current and lagged y \n\nvalues do not explain, that is, there is no feedback relationship. Moreover, the author \n\ndefined ?? as super-exogenous if the parameters values in the regression of y on x are \n\ninvariant to changes in the values of x.  \n\nAccording to Johansen (1992), the weak exogeneity is a relevant condition to apply \n\nthe conditional model for the estimation of the long-run parameters. The concept of weak \n\nexogeneity was introduced to justify considering some variables as given (exogenous) in \n\nthe analysis of other (endogenous) variables. On the other hand, Ericsson et al (1998) \n\nstated that the weak exogeneity is the requirement for conditional estimation to be without \n\nloss of information from conditioning.   \n\nIn a different note, Johansen et al (1990) referred that the factor loadings ? contain \n\ninformation about exogeneity and, consequently, also about the price leadership. If one \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nelement in the ? vector is zero, the respective price will be weakly exogenous, that is, it \n\nis determined outside of the system. In this case, if the factor loading parameter in the \n\nequation for the exchange rate XBT/USD is zero, the data will show that the exchange \n\nrate is determined outside of the system. \n\nIn order to test the existence of weak exogeneity, following the Johansen (1995) \n\nmethodology, EViews allows us to impose restrictions on the adjustment coefficients, \n\nbased on the (i, j)-th elements of the ? matrix, referred as A(i, j). Furthermore, assuming \n\nthat there is only one cointegration relation in the VEC, to test whether the second \n\nendogenous variable is weakly exogenous with respect to ?, we should enter the \n\nrestriction: A(2,1) = 0.  \n\nThis test will be applied to the variables combinations denoting a long-run \n\nrelationship, based on the Johansen cointegration test. Then, the LR statistic will be \n\nreported in the EViews output if the degrees of freedom of the asymptotic Chi-Square-\n\ndistribution is positive. If the null hypothesis is not rejected (prob. > 0,05 significance \n\nlevel), it will be concluded that the endogenous variable i is weakly exogenous with \n\nrespect to the parameters ? (Johansen, 1991). If any of the endogenous variables are \n\nconsidered weakly exogenous, it will be analyzed its strong exogeneity through the \n\nGranger causality.  \n\nAccording to Ericsson et al (1998), a Granger non-causality is one of the conditions \n\nrequired for strong exogeneity, where the Granger causality is defined as the presence of \n\nfeedback from one variable to another. With Granger non-causality there is the absence \n\nof such feedback. Indeed, these authors mentioned that Granger non-causality is neither \n\nnecessary nor sufficient for weak exogeneity. However, Granger non-causality combined \n\nwith weak exogeneity defines strong exogeneity.  \n\nAs detailed by Granger (1969) and synthetized by Pacheco (2010), this \n\nmethodology is based on the following notes. \n\nIn spite of regression analysis deals with the dependence of one variable on other \n\nvariables, it is not a necessary implication of causation. This means that the existence of \n\na relationship between variables does not evidence causality or the influence direction. In \n\ntime series regressions, it is also important to take into consideration that time does not \n\ngoes back. This is the basis of the Granger causality test and it means that if even x \n\nhappens before y, then it will be possible that x is causing y but not the contrary.  \n\nIndeed, the Granger (1969) approach to the question of whether x causes y, as \n\nexplained by Curto (2013), is to see how much of the current y can be explained by past \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n47 \n \n\nvalues of x and then to see whether adding lagged values of x can improved the \n\nexplanation. Then, y is said to be Granger-caused by x if x helps in the prediction of y, \n\nthat is, if the coefficients on the lagged x\u2019s are statistically significant. It is also frequent \n\nto see a bidirectional relationship, where x Granger causes y and y Granger causes x. \n\nHowever, it is important to emphasize that one condition does not imply the other.  \n\nConsidering the pair of (x,y) series and the lag length k, corresponding to the \n\nreasonable longest time over which one of the variables could help to predict the other, \n\nthe bivariate regressions are given as follows: \n\n?? = ?0 + ?1???1 + ? + ?? ???? + ?1???1 + ? + ?? ???? + ??   (14) \n\n?? = ?0 + ?1???1 + ? + ?? ?? ?? + ?1???1 + ? + ?? ???? + ??    (15) \n\n \n\nThen, the test reported F-statistics are the Wald statistics for the joint hypothesis: \n\n?0 : ?1 = ?2 = ? = ?? = 0        \n\nfor each equation. Therefore, the null hypothesis is that x does not Granger causes y in \n\nthe first regression and that y does not Granger causes x in the second one. \n\nSumming up, it is possible to distinguish between four causality types: \n\ni) Unidirectional causality, where x Granger causes y, when the null hypothesis \n\nis rejected in the first regression and it is not in the second one; \n\nii) Unidirectional causality, where y Granger causes x, when the null hypothesis \n\nis not rejected in the first regression but it is rejected in the second one; \n\niii) Bilateral causality, when the null hypothesis is rejected in both regressions, \n\nmeaning that x Granger causes y and y Granger causes x; \n\niv) Independence, when the null is not rejected in both regressions, showing that \n\nwhere x does not Granger causes y and y does not Granger causes x. \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\n5. Empirical Results \n\nAs mentioned in the section 3., this study will consider the following variables: the \n\nXBT/USD exchange rate (XBTUSD), the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate \n\n(WTI) crude oil (CL1:COM); the gold price (GC1:COM); the 6-month U.S. Treasury \n\nYield (USGG6M); 10-year U.S. Treasury Yield (USGG10YR) and the S&amp;P 500 Index \n\n(SPX:IND).  \n\nIn order to understand if there is some long-term equilibrium between the variables, \n\nfirstly it is necessary to verify if all the time series are nonstationary and if they are \n\nintegrated of the same order. For this purpose, it will be computed the Breakpoint Unit \n\nRoot Test for each variable, considering possible unknown structural breaks.  \n\nTherefore, for the nonstationary time series that are integrated of order one, it will \n\nbe applied the Johansen Cointegration test. Since the purpose of this study is to understand \n\nif any of the time series presents some long-run relationship with the exchange rate \n\nXBT/USD, it will be applied the bivariate Johansen cointegration test. This test is \n\nperformed for each two variables system, allowing to analyse those relationships, one by \n\none, on a simpler way than the multivariate cointegration. \n\n Lastly, if we conclude that the variables are cointegrated, it will be estimated the \n\nVector Error Correction Model (VECM) for each cointegration relationship.  \n\n \n\nAll the tests were computed in the EViews program [63] according to the \n\nmethodology and approaches described in the section 4. Note that the EViews program \n\nreplaces all colons (\u201c:\u201d) by underscores (\u201c_\u201d) in the variables names. \n\nAll the conclusions presented in this section, and for statistical inference purposes, \n\nconsider a 5% level of significance.  \n\n \n\n5.1. Breakpoint Unit Root Tests \n\nLooking at the graphical representation of the daily quotations of each variable, \n\npresented in the appendixes A to F, no series shows to remain more or less constant in \n\nterms of variance and mean. Additionally, there also appears to be changes in the prices \n\nbehavior, namely in the exchange rate XBT/USD where it is possible to observe some \n\nbitcoin\u2019s value triggers. Therefore, it is important to take into account the possibility of \n\nstructural breaks when testing the stationarity of the series. \n\nIn order to test the stationarity of the daily prices of each variable, from 1st January \n\n2013 to 28th August 2017, it was computed the Breakpoint Unit Root test in the Eviews \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n49 \n \n\nprogram [23], where the null hypothesis is that the time series has a unit root. As described \n\nin the section 4.1., the test was computed based on the original data, without no trend \n\nrestrictions (with trend and intercept), considering the innovational outlier model and \n\nusing the Schwarz criterion and the Dickey-Fuller min-t for the lag length and breakpoint \n\nselections, respectively (see appendix G).  \n\nThe Table 1 summarises the Breakpoint Unit Root Test for each variable, based on \n\nthe EViews outputs presented in the appendixes H to M. \n\n \n\nVariable \n\nProbabilities of the Dickey-Fuller Test \n\nC TREND \nINCPT \n\nBREAK \n\nTREND \n\nBREAK \n\nBREAK \n\nDUM \nADF Test \n\nXBTUSD 0,2463 0,0459** 0,6433 0,0000** 0,1269 0,8535 \n\nCL1:COM 0,0000** 0,7315 0,0000** 0,5504 0,0841 0,1831 \n\nGC1:COM 0,0000** 0,0023** 0,0023** 0,2390 0,1196 0,2793 \n\nUSGG6M 0,5111 0,8754 0,4189 0,0038** 0,0078** 0,9534 \n\nUSGG10YR 0,0001** 0,0035** 0,0008** 0,0567 0,6669 0,6543 \n\nSPX:IND 0,0010** N/A 0,0028** N/A 0,0385** 0,5646 \n\n*Denotes rejection of the null hypothesis at the 0,05 significance level. \n**Statistically significant coefficient, considering a 0,05 significance level. \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Resume of the Breakpoint Unit Root Test outputs presented in the appendixes H to M. \n\n \n\nAll the tests show to not reject the null hypothesis (Prob. (ADF test) > 0,05 \n\nsignificance level) and, therefore, we can conclude that the each time series has a unit \n\nroot. For the S&amp;P 500 Index prices, since the null was firstly rejected and its trend break \n\nwas not statistically significant, the test was computed only with intercept. Then, the \n\nconclusion was that the time series has a unit root. \n\nFor the remaining variable, when recomputed the tests considering only the \n\nstatistically significant coefficients, without (**), in the trend specifications, the \n\nconclusions were the same. Therefore, those outputs were not included.  \n\nOnce all the time series are nonstationary, in order to check if they are integrated of \n\norder one, we will recompute the Breakpoint Unit Root Test in first differences for each \n\nvariable, that is, using the daily returns instead of the daily prices. Before looking to tests \n\nresults, in the appendixes A to F are also graphically represented the daily returns of each \n\ntime series. Comparing the two charts of each time series, despite the existence of some \n\noutliers, such as in the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields daily returns (see Chart 8), it is \n\npossible to conclude that the first differences time series tend to remain more constant in \n\nterms of variance and mean than the original data. Thus, it is expectable that the first \n\ndifferences time series tend to be stationary.  \n\n\n\n50 \n\n \n\nVariable \n\nProbabilities of the Dickey-Fuller Test \n\nC TREND \nINCPT \n\nBREAK \n\nTREND \n\nBREAK \n\nBREAK \n\nDUM \nADF Test \n\nD(XBTUSD) 0,2270 0,0073** 0,0126** 0,0062** 0,0000** &lt;0,01* \n\nD(CL1:COM) 0,1793 0,0439** 0,4189 0,0213** 0,0000** &lt;0,01* \n\nD(GC1:COM) 0,8545 0,3903 0,1514 0,3829 0,0000** &lt;0,01* \n\nD(USGG6M) 0,8316 0,8978 0,7316 0,9433 0,0000** &lt;0,01* \n\nD(USGG10YR) 0,5679 0,1524 0,0454** 0,1583 0,0000** &lt;0,01* \n\nD(SPX:IND) 0,0906 0,2958 0,7037 0,3696 0,0000** &lt;0,01* \n\n*Denotes rejection of the null hypothesis at the 0,05 significance level. \n**Statistically significant coefficient, considering a 0,05 significance level. \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Resume of the Breakpoint Unit Root Test outputs presented in the appendixes N to S. \n\n \n\nObserving the summary of the Breakpoint Unit Root Tests for the first differences \n\nof each variable, in the Table 2, it is possible to conclude that all the ADF test results poit \n\nto reject the null hypothesis (Prob. (ADF test) &lt;0,05 significance level). Therefore, the \n\ntime series have no unit root in first differences and we can conclude they are integrated \n\nof order one. \n\nOnce again, when recomputed the tests considering only the statistically significant \n\ncoefficients, without (**), in the trend specifications, the conclusions were the same. \n\nTherefore, those outputs were not included.  \n\nBased on the previous unit root tests, it is possible to conclude that all the variables \n\nare nonstationary and integrated of order one I(1). So, we can proceed with tests of \n\ncointegration. \n\n \n\n5.2. Cointegration test \n\nIn this section we will perform a bivariate cointegration analysis, that is, we will \n\ninvestigate the long-run relationships between the exchange rate XBT/USD and each of \n\nthe other variables considered in this study. Like this, we will test five variables \n\ncombinations, considering the respective five VAR systems.  \n\nFirstly, it is necessary to choose the optimum lag number of VAR representation. \n\nThis selection will be done based on information criteria, specifically based on the \n\nSchwarz Information Criterion (SC). In order to do not over-parameterize the models, we \n\ninvestigated the VAR lag number, for each combination of two variables, until a \n\nmaximum of eight lags.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n51 \n \n\nVariables \n\nVAR Lag Order Selection Criteria \n\nAkaike Information \n\nCriterion \n\nSchwarz Information \n\nCriterion \n\nHannan-Quinn \n\nInformation Criterion \n\nXBTUSD \u2013 CL1:COM 2 1 2 \n\nXBTUSD \u2013 GC1:COM 2 1 2 \n\nXBTUSD \u2013 USGG6M 8 1 1 \n\nXBTUSD \u2013 USGG10YR 2 1 1 \n\nXBTUSD \u2013 SPX:IND 2 1 1 \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Resume of the VAR Lag Order Selection Criteria outputs presented in the appendixes T to X. \n\n \n\nBased on the Schwarz Information Criteria, it was selected one lag for all the VAR \n\nrepresentations. The Table 3 shows the optimum lag number of VAR representation, \n\nbased on the Akaike, Schwarz and Hannan-Quinn information criteria.  \n\nAfter the lag number selection, it is necessary to choose the trend assumption to \n\nconsider in each test, in the Cointegration Equation (CE) and Vector Autoregressive \n\n(VAR). In this case, we are not certain which trend assumption to consider. Therefore, it \n\nis possible to compute the Johansen cointegration test with the summary of all five trend \n\nassumptions, in the EViews program. This option indicates the number of cointegrating \n\nrelations under each trend assumption. The five trend assumptions are the following: \n\n1) No deterministic trend - No intercept or trend in CE or VAR; \n\n2) Linear deterministic trend - Intercept (no trend) in CE and no intercept in VAR; \n\n3) Linear deterministic trend  - Intercept (no trend) in CE and VAR; \n\n4) Linear deterministic trend  - Intercept and trend in CE and no trend in VAR; \n\n5) Quadratic deterministic trend - Intercept and trend in CE and trend in VAR. \n\n \n\nTo choose the trend assumption, we can use information criteria based on Log \n\nLikelihood (LL), Akaike Information (AIC) and Schwarz information Criteria (SC). As \n\nmentioned before, we will give preference to the Schwarz criteria. The EViews test shows \n\nthe results by rank and model. \n\nThe Table 4 summarizes the best trend assumption for each variables combination \n\nbased on the Information Criteria detailed in the appendixes Y to AC. \n\nVariables LL AIC SIC \nTrend \n\nAssumption \n\nXBTUSD - CL1:COM Model 4 / Model 5 Model 1 Model 1 / Model 2 Model 1 \n\nXBTUSD - GC1:COM Model 4 / Model 5 Model 3 Model 1 / Model 2 Model 1 \n\nXBTUSD - USGG6M Model 4 / Model 5 Model 4 Model 1 Model 1 \n\nXBTUSD - USGG10YR Model 4 / Model 5 Model 1 Model 1 / Model 2 Model 1 \n\nXBTUSD - SPX:IND Model 4 / Model 5 Model 1 Model 1 / Model 2 Model 1 \n\nTable 4 \u2013 Trend assumption selection based on the Information Criteria presented in the appendixes Y to AC. \n\n \n\n\n\n52 \n\n \n\nThe Schwarz information Criterion shows that the Model 1, with no deterministic \n\ntrend data and no intercept or trend in CE or VAR, is the best trend assumption for all the \n\nvariables combinations. Excepting for the VAR system of XBTUSD and USGG6M, the \n\nModel 1 is as good as the Model 2. Then, to simplify, we will consider no deterministic \n\ntrend in all the cointegration tests.  \n\nSumming up, the Johansen Cointegration Test will be performed between the \n\nexchange rate XBT/USD and each of the other variables, with no deterministic trend. \n\n \n\nWe will start with the Bivariate Johansen test for cointegration, that is, the \n\ncointegration between each two variables combination. As mentioned before, the tests \n\nwill be computed for one lag and with no deterministic trend.  \n\nOnce again, the results of the Trace and the Maximum Eigenvalue tests are \n\npresented in the Table 5 and detailed in the appendixes AD to AH. \n\nVariables Rank Eigenvalue Trace Statistic \nMax.

Then, the \n\nresults point for one cointegration equation for each relationship. Indeed, if it was \n\nconsidered the 1% significance level, the conclusion would be the same since all the \n\nprobabilities are 0,0000 &lt;significance level.  \n\nTherefore, it is possible to conclude that the cointegration analysis points to a long-\n\nrun relationship between the exchange rate XBT/USD and each of the other variables, \n\nspecifically the price per barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, the gold \n\nprice, the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yield, the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yield and the S&amp;P \n\n500 Index. In other words, this implies that each times series is integrated with the \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n53 \n \n\nexchange rate XBT/USB, where it is possible to estimate the Vector Error Correction \n\nModel for each one.  \n\n \n\n5.3. VEC Model Estimation \n\nAccording to the previous tests and assumptions, the Vector Error Correction \n\nModel will be estimated for each bivariate cointegration relationship, considering one lag \n\nand no deterministic trend.  \n\nThe VEC estimates are detailed in the appendixes AI to AM. In order to interpret \n\nthe significance of the coefficients, it is necessary to analyse the t-statistics considering \n\nthe t-statistic critical value of approximately -1,96, for a 5% significance level. The t-\n\nstatistics are identified in the EViews outputs [63]. Hence, with 5% of significance level, \n\nthe coefficient is statistically significant if the t-statistic will be lower than -1,96 or higher \n\nthan 1,96.  \n\nBased on these outputs, it is possible to conclude that the estimates for the \n\ncoefficients ? of the long-term relationship equations are not statistically different from \n\nzero, at 5% significance level, for the relationships between XBTUSD and CL1:COM, \n\nUSGG10YR and SPX:IND, respectively. Based on the bivariate cointegration tests, it \n\nwas expected that there would be some long-run equilibrium between the Bitcoin prices \n\nand these variables. However, since the coefficients ? are not statistically significant, we \n\ncannot conclude that there is a long-term relationship between one of these variables and \n\nthe exchange rate XBT/USD. \n\nIn the appendixes AN to AR are presented five graphical representations where it \n\nis possible to compare the exchange rate XBT/USD historical prices behaviour with each \n\nof the time series behaviours.  \n\nStarting by the exchange rate XBT/USD and the Crude Price daily prices, the Chart \n\n13 (see appendix AN) shows that these times series have different behaviours during the \n\nobservation period. While the exchange rate XBT/USD tends to increase with time, the \n\nCrude price shows a decreasing tendency. Moreover, in periods that XBT/USD keeps \n\nmore constant, namely in the first semester of 2015, the Crude price suffers large \n\nvariations. These are in line with the absence of some long-run equilibrium between the \n\nBitcoin and the Crude prices.  \n\nLooking at the Chart 14, the conclusion is not the same. Indeed, until the beginning \n\nof 2017, both time series do not show huge trend variations, being possible to observe \n\nsmall increases and decreases. Additionally, it is possible to observe that the Gold price \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\ntend to decrease, while the Bitcoin price tend to increase, mainly in 2013. This may mean \n\nthat, since there is a cointegration relationship between these variables, possibly the Gold \n\nprice positive variations will promote the Bitcoin prices negative variations, and vice \n\nversa.  \n\nRegarding the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields, through the Chart 15 in the appendix \n\nAP, it is possible to see that this time series tends to have the same behaviour that the \n\nBitcoin prices, both with an increasing trend during the observation period. This is in \n\naccordance with the conclusion of the existence of a long-term relationship between these \n\nvariables and it may indicate that positive variations in the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields \n\nwill promote the Bitcoin prices positive variations, and vice versa.  \n\nObserving the Chart 16, in the appendix AQ, it is possible to identify some \n\nsimilarities with the Crude price. It shows that these times series have different behaviours \n\nduring the observation period, where the exchange rate XBT/USD tends to increase with \n\ntime, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yields show a decreasing trend. Moreover, in \n\nperiods that XBT/USD keeps more constant, namely in the first semester of 2015, the 10-\n\nyear U.S. Treasury Yields suffer large variations. These are in line with the absence of \n\nsome long-run equilibrium between them. \n\nFinally, through the Chart 17, presented in the appendix AR, it is possible to \n\nconclude that the S&amp;P 500 Index prices tend to have a linear increase trend, without deep \n\nchanges or outliers. On the other hand, the Bitcoin prices graphical representation denotes \n\nchanges in behaviour over time, which also points to the inexistence of long-run \n\nequilibrium between the Bitcoin and the S&amp;P 500 Index prices.  \n\n \n\nFor the combinations showing a long-term relationships, the estimated equations \n\nfor XBTUSD are given by: \n\n???????? = ?0,073039?????????1 + 0,008025(????????1 ? 0,219458??1: ?????1)  \n\n? ???????? = ?0,073039?????????1 + 0,008025????????1 ? 0,00176??1: ?????1  \n\n \n\n???????? = ?0,068004?????????1 + 0,002365(????????1 + 3.802,169????6???1 )   \n\n? ???????? = ?0,068004?????????1 + 0,002365????????1 + 8,99213????6???1) \n\n \n\nThese estimations points that on average and in the short term an increase in the \n\ngold price promotes a decrease in the exchange rate XBT/USD (negative coefficient), \n\nwhile the increase in the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields promotes an increase in the \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n55 \n \n\nexchange rate XBT/USD (positive coefficient). These conclusions were those expected \n\nfrom the previous time series graphical analysis.  \n\nHowever, it is important to note that the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields changes \n\ntends do not affect the Bitcoin prices on a significant way, since the estimate for the \n\ncoefficient is 0,00176.  \n\n \n\n5.4. Exogeneity \n\nFollowing Johansen (1992, 1995), a weak exogeneity test has been applied to each \n\nseries, testing every element of the adjustment matrix coefficient against zero. Performing \n\nthis test to the variables denoting a relation of cointegration with the exchange rate \n\nXBT/USD, the outputs are presented in the appendix AS.  \n\nThen, it is possible to conclude that the null hypothesis of weak exogeneity can be \n\nrejected in the cointegration relationship between XBT/USD and USGG6M (prob. &lt;0,05 \n\nsignificance level).  \n\nOn the other hand, for the relationship between XBT/USD and GC1:COM, the null \n\nis not rejected (prob. > 0,05 significance level), so the test points to a weak exogeneity. \n\nThis weak exogeneity shows an absence of significant adjustment in the long-term \n\nrelationship of the corresponding VEC Model. Nevertheless, for the GC1:COM remains \n\nonly a short-term relationship with the exchange rate XBT/USD, also implying that its \n\nprices cannot be used to forecast XBT/USD in the long-run. For this to be also the case \n\nin the short-run, these prices must be strongly exogenous and hence not affected by the \n\nshort-run movements in XBT/USD. \n\nObserving the Granger causality test (appendix AT), to check if there were any \n\nsigns of strong exogeneity for the weak exogenous variable, a causal relationship was not \n\nfound for the pair XBT/USD \u2013 GC1:COM. Therefore, there is no strong exogeneity of \n\nGC1:COM and it is possible to conclude that remains a short-term relationship with \n\nexchange rate XBT/USD.  \n\n \n\nSumming up, through the study of the dynamic relationships between Bitcoin prices \n\nand each of the five other variables, the results showed that only the 6-month U.S. \n\nTreasury Yields present a long-run relationship with the Bitcoin prices, being possible to \n\nuse their rates to forecast the exchange rate XBT/USD in the short term.   \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n6. Conclusion \n\nThe present dissertation \u201cVirtual currency: A cointegration analysis between \n\nBitcoin prices and economic and financial data\u201d investigated the existence of dynamic \n\nrelationships between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data. The variables \n\nselected for this thesis were chosen taking in consideration their relationship with physical \n\ncurrencies, already showed on previous studies. The data included the Crude and Gold \n\nprices, the 6-month and 1-year U.S. Treasury Yields and the S&amp;P 500 Index prices. \n\nBitcoin as a digital currency, emerges in a specific part of the law where there is still \n\nmany legal blanks, as so, it was not expected that instabilities on economic and financial \n\ndata would have the same impacts or relationships as the ones in physical currencies. \n\nIn order to achieve this dissertation\u2019s proposal, it was important to (i) test the \n\npresence of non-stationarity and first-order integration in each of time series considered \n\nin this analysis, admitting the existence of structural breaks in the data; (ii) test the \n\ncointegration between the exchange rate XBT/USD and each of the remaining variables \n\nunder study; (iii) estimate the vector error correction model for the variables cointegrated \n\nwith the Bitcoin prices; and (iv) test the weak exogeneity, which implies the absence of \n\nsignificant adjustments in the long-run relationship and, consequently, the preclusion of \n\nusing the model to forecast the Bitcoin prices. \n\nAs the results showed that all the considered time series are non-stationary and \n\nintegrated of order one, all the data was included in the next tests. Therefore, the bivariate \n\ncointegration Johansen tests pointed to a long-run relationship between the exchange rate \n\nXBT/USD and each of the other variables, specifically the price per barrel of West Texas \n\nIntermediate (WTI) crude oil, the gold price, the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yield, the 10-\n\nyear U.S. Treasury Yield and the S&amp;P 500 Index quotations. Accordingly, it was \n\nestimated the Vector Error Correction Model for each one.  \n\nDespite the cointegration results, the estimates for the parameters of the VECM \n\nmodel revealed that only the long-term relationships between the exchange rate \n\nXBT/USD and the gold price and the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yield are statistically \n\nsignificant. For the other relationships, only the short-term relation has emerged from \n\nestimation results.  \n\nAdditionally, the VEC model estimations pointed that, on average and in the short \n\nterm, an increase in the gold price promotes a decrease in the exchange rate XBT/USD, \n\nwhile the increase in the 6-month U.S. Treasury Yields promotes an increase in the \n\nexchange rate XBT/USD. However, it is important to note that the 6-month U.S. Treasury \n\n\n\nA cointegration analysis between Bitcoin prices and economic and financial data \n\n57 \n \n\nYields changes tends to not affect the Bitcoin prices on a significant way, since the \n\nestimate for the coefficient is close to zero. \n\nThen, considering these two models, it was performed the exogeneity tests, \n\nconcluding that in the gold price system there was an absence of significant adjustment \n\nin the long-term relationship of the corresponding VEC Model. Nevertheless, for the gold \n\nprice remains only a short-term relationship with the exchange rate XBT/USD, also \n\nimplying that its prices cannot be used to forecast XBT/USD in the long-run. \n\nSumming up, through the study of the dynamic relationships between Bitcoin prices \n\nand each of the five other variables, the results showed that only the 6-month U.S. \n\nTreasury Yields present a long-run relationship with the Bitcoin prices, being possible to \n\nuse their rates to forecast the exchange rate XBT/USD in the short term.  \n\nIt should be noted that the current dissertation has limitations that are important to \n\nconsider. Firstly, the variables selection was based on their relationship with physical \n\ncurrencies, being possible that they are not the suitable variables to relate with the Bitcoin \n\nprices and to use to forecast them. On the other hand, the Johansen test assumes that there \n\nare no structural breaks and the exchange rate XBT/USD behaviour shows multiple \n\nstructural changes. This could be sorted out through structural breaks identification and \n\nconsequent division of the data samples into sub-samples. Lastly, in order to ensure the \n\nrobustness of the model, it should be included additional related variables.  \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n58 \n\n \n\n7.
