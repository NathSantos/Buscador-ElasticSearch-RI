To make a good investment in gold we need to determine the relevant factors that affect the price of gold. In study this I analyse the returns of gold, silver and returns of six gold ETFs and five silver ETFs. I analyse whether the return of S&amp;P 500, VIX, return of US dollar exchange rate, interest rate, inflation rate and return of crude oil are factors affect gold and silver returns in the period from January 2000 to December 2013.\nThe empirical results find that return of US dollar explains the gold and silver returns, more specifically when return of US dollar appreciates, the gold and silver returns depreciate and vice versa. The return of S&amp;P 500, VIX, interest rate and inflation do not affect the returns of gold and silver. The return of crude oil has no relationship with return of gold, however it has a weak affect the return of silver. The variation of inflation rate allows us to explain changes of returns of silver ETFs. The low R-squared values are explained by the fact that coefficients vary over a long time.\nKeywords: Gold investment; Silver; Exchange-Traded Fund; Regression; Macroeconomic factors;\nJEL Classification: G11, C10.\nAcknowledgments\nForemost, I would like to express sincere thanks to my supervisor, Sofia Brito Ramos for the guidance and constant support throughout the study, despite a busy schedule.

Individuals held gold as in form of jewellery, bars or coins, governments and central banks around the world held gold as monetary reserve assets and small bars as insurance against currency devaluation.1\nFigure 1\nHistorical gold prices per ounce in pounds since 1265\nSource: Bank of England Goldman Sachs global ECS research\nLike no other precious metal, gold has a fascinating history that began around 5,000 years ago. Historically gold has been seen as more attractive investment than stocks and bonds or other assets classes, not only for the positive returns but also as safe haven in time of difficulty.\nOn Figure 1, we see that in deep 1265 price of gold was very volatile. Later, over period 1500 - 1965 gold had a bear market, as a consequence price declined by almost 80%. However, in the 1970s the gold price began to rise and created a bull market for investors and a possibility to freely trade on the markets. In middle of 2007 of the beginning financial crisis the nominal price of the gold has risen by 42%.\ni Silver &amp; Gold, Energy and Environmental Profile of the U.S. Department of Energy, available online at http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2013Z11/f4/gold-silver.pdf\nShafiee and Topal (2009) point out that over 2007 the price of gold moved in the same manner as in 1978. However the price of gold is still turbulent. It has ups and downs from time to time due to the economic conditions, political uncertainties and condition on financial markets. Thus it is very important for investors to know the current price of gold. In order to take advantages on when to buy gold at a lower price and sell at higher price. Therefore, we need to analyze the relevant factors that may have an effect on gold price in order to determine appropriate time when investors can make investment in gold.\nIn this study analyze the effect of return of S&amp;P 500, VIX (volatility), return of US dollar exchange rate, inflation rate, interest rate, and return of crude oil on returns of gold and silver, returns of silver ETFs and gold ETFs. The analysis will use method of Ordinary Least Squares with data over period from January 2000 to December 2013.\nThis paper consists of following sections: Section 2 makes a brief literature review about investing in gold and gold Exchange-Traded Funds. In Section 3, describes the demand by categories: jewellery and investments, and gold supply. Section 4 describes the data and methodology used in the study. Section 5 provides the empirical findings: structural breaks for gold and silver prices, descriptive statistics for returns of gold, silver, returns of six gold ETFs and five silver ETFs. Moreover, section shows the regression analysis, to determine which variables have an effect on returns of gold, silver and returns of gold ETFs, silver ETFs and rolling window estimation to see how the gold variables change over time.\n2.\tLiterature Review\n2.1\tInvesting in Gold\nGoodboy (2013) argues that in recent years gold and silver have been the favourite precious metals of most investors. Moreover, they are the most enduring form of currency and investment in the world. They serve as a medium of monetary exchange and store of value. Despite their differences and similarities as a commodity, investors prefer to own gold than silver. The reason is that silver is used mostly for industrial purposes, whereas gold is used for investment and jewellery.2 Singh and Nadda (2013) note that an investor has various investment options: mutual funds, stock markets, hedge funds, gold and commodities.\n2 North, G. 2011. The Gold Wars. The Tea Party Economists, available at http://www.garynorth.com/GoldWars.pdf.\nHowever, higher risks provide the possibility of higher return. One of the reasons people still prefer to invest in gold than stock market is because of the safe and growth characteristics. They also found that gold has been one of the best performing asset classes. Greenwood and Steiner (2011) state that from 2000 to 2010 gold increased in value by a cumulative 398%. Furthermore, over the same period, gold outperformed emerging markets, bonds, Treasury bills, commodities, oil and platinum.\nTraditionally, gold investment can be made in few different ways: physical gold, gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), gold mutual funds and other form of gold investments through buying gold certificates or through gold accounts.3 According to the World Gold Council physical gold is one of the most direct ways of investing in gold, and it can be done by buying: gold bullions, coins and jewellery.\nNumerous studies have examined the status of gold as investments: Feldman (2010) argues that an investor has a few ways to use gold as part of his investment strategy: potential \u201csafe haven\u201d during political or economic uncertainty also supports (Baur and Lucey (2010), Baur and McDermott (2010), Hood and Farooq (2013) and Harmston (1998)), hedge against the US dollar devaluation also pointed (Reboredo (2013)), portfolio diversification over both long and short-term horizons and hedge against inflation also provides (Worthington and Pahlavani (2006), Blose (2010)). While Brier (2012) argues that gold is purely speculative investment what makes big swings in price of gold.\nBaur and Lucey (2010) examine \u201chedge\u201d and \u201csafe haven\u201d assets, i.e. assets that are uncorrelated or negatively correlate with the other types of asset classes. Therefore, gold is referred as \u201csafe haven\u201d during negative market events that give opportunity investors protect their wealth.\nBaur and McDermott (2010) examine gold as strong \u201csafe haven\u201d for most developing markets during market turmoil. During the stock market crash in 1987, gold showed a strong \u201csafe haven\u201d for the major Eurozone market, but not \"safe haven\" for Asian and Australian emerging markets. They also pointed out ability gold be \u201csafe haven\u201d for stocks but not for bonds.\n3\tWhy buy Gold? Trustable gold, available at http://www.trustablegold.com/gold-investment/\nBeckmen and Czudaj (2012) discuss gold investments as hedge against inflation in a long-run for the USA and United Kingdom economies. Reboredo (2013) and Hood and Farooq (2013) describe investment in gold as a strong \u201csafe haven\u201d for oil market movements and as a hedge against movements of US dollar.\nThe World Gold Council argues that gold also plays strategic diversification investment role. The investment allocation on gold depends on the level of risk. Small allocation adds diversification benefit to the portfolio with a low level of risk (1%-3%). Helmersson, Kang and Scold (2008) conclude that by including gold to the portfolio, it could improve an investor performance by increasing return or minimize in risks. That makes it more attractive especially in times of recession. Shafiee and Topal (2010) and McCown and Zimmerman (2006) describe gold investment as an insurance against stock market losses.\nBaur (2013) pointed out that over the historical period from 1980 to 2010 gold prices showed significant positive returns especially in the months between September and November according to the season anomaly called the \u201cautumn effect\u201d. The extreme periods of gold prices for investors occurred: Stock markets crashed (October, 1987), Asian Financial Crises (October, 1997), Global Financial Crises (September and October, 2008).\n2.2\tInvesting in Gold ETFs\nAccording to the World Gold Council, gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) were launched in the early part of 21st century and emerged as a better gold investment for portfolio diversification. Gold ETFs are open-ended mutual funds, whose securities listed and traded on the stock exchange based on the price of metal. The upside of gold ETFs is that they are traded like stocks and move as spot futures.4\nThe world's largest gold Exchange-Traded Fund is SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), founded in 2004. The SPDR was developed to track the gold price and as an alternative to owning physical gold. SPDR is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), but also traded in: Japan (TYO), Hong Kong (SEHK) and Singapore (SGX) an average of 24 million shares on a daily basis representing 2.4 million ounces of gold.5\n4\tPierce, E. 2012.

Assets and Average Volume as of 22/10/2013\nSource: ETF database\nOn Table 1, we can see the list of major gold ETFs currently traded in the USA. By column we describe: symbol, name and price, assets in US dollars, average volume and yield to returns. Mallika and Sulphey (2013) point out that, typically, 1 gram of the gold price is equal to each unit of the ETF. Moreover, there is another Quantum gold ETF, where each unit equal to a gram of gold.\nMany studies pointed out the beneficial characteristics of investing in gold ETFs. Carty (2001), Gallagher and Segara (2005) and Nedeljkovic (2005) describe risk diversification, cost efficiency and safe characteristics, whereas Prashanta and Suhitra (2010), Singh and Nadda (2013) note that gold ETFs offer investors the benefits of lower taxes and zero storage costs. Nedeljkovic (2005) also describes gold ETFs as highly liquid investments with no credit risk. They are simple an accessible option to the investors. Wang, Hussain and Adnan (2010) argue that gold ETFs are highly valuable investments and extremely successful of basket securities. They offer investors to trade the portfolio easily and quickly with no high transaction costs. Agyei-Amapomah, Gounopoulosb and Mazouz (2014) note that gold ETFs\nare more liquid than investment in physical gold through buying: gold bullion, jewellery or bars and coins (see Table 2).\nTable 2\nComparison of gold ETFs with physical gold\n\tGold ETF\tJewellery\tBank\nHow Gold is held\tElectronic form\tPhysical (Bar /Coin /Jewellery)\tPhysical (Bar/Coin)\nTransparency\tVery high\tVery low\tHigh\nImpurity risk\tNil\tHigh\tNil\nWealth tax\tNo\tYes\tYes\nQuantity to Buy/ Sell)\tMinimum is or 1 gram according to the fund\tAvailable in standard denomination\tAvailable in standard denomination\nResale\tAt Secondary Market Prices\tConditional and economical\tBanks do not buy back\nConvince buying/selling\tMore convenient as held in electronic from under demat account\tLess convenient, as gold needs to be physically moved\tLess convenient, as gold needs to be physically moved\nBuying Premium above gold price\tLikely to be less\tLikely to be more\tLikely to be more\nSecurity of Assets\tFund house take responsibility\tInvestor are responsible\tInvestor are responsible\nBid Ask Spread\tVery low\tVery high\tCan't sell back\nRisk of Theft\tNo\tYes\tYes\nLong Term Capital Gains Tax\tAfter 1 year\tOnly after 3 years\tOnly after 3 years\nSource: Gold Exchange Traded Fund - Equity Bulls\nTable 2 shows gold ETFs compared with investments in physical gold. By columns, we describe: gold ETFs, jewellery and bank investments in gold. By rows, we have main investment parameters.\n3.\tDemand and supply of gold\nDorgan (2013) argues that gold and silver depend more on the supply and demand situation then others commodities or asset classes. However, gold reacts slowly, whereas silver and crude oil reacting faster on demand and supply situation. Lampinen (2007) and Greenwood and Steiner (2011) argue that gold is used for: physical purposes (jewellery, electronics),\ninvestor purposes (both government and private) and also industrial applications (including dental and medical uses). The World Gold Council separates total gold demand into few categories: jewellery demand, investment demand, technological demand and demand of central banks.\nFigure 2\nGold demand by category (tonnes) and price of gold\n\u25a0\tJewellery \u25a0 Technology \u25a0 Investment\n\u25a0\tCentral bank net purchases ---- London Ph/\nSource: LBMA, Thomson Routers GFMS, World Gold Council\nOn Figure 2, shows annual gold demand by categories during the period 2003-2012. The growing demand came from: jewellery and investment. Following Baur and McDermott (2010) the largest component of gold demand is jewellery, determined by consumers speeding power.\n3.1\tJewellery demand\nGold as jewellery has been used for a very long time, over five thousands of years. The largest world customers of gold jewellery in 2012 were: China with customer demand of 800 tonnes, followed by India with 720 tonnes and the United States, with 128 tonnes.6\nChilkoti and Crabtree (2013) argue that in India gold is viewed as a charming national quirk driven by elaborate weddings and religious offerings. During the Hindi festivals, Diwali religious holidays gold purchasing power increases very fast with further pressure on external\n6\tSupply and demand of gold: Jewellery, available at http://goldratefortoday.org/demand-gold-jewelry\nfinancing. According to the World Gold Council, both India and China generates almost 56% of total annual jewellery demand in 2012, higher by 8% compared to 2011. Far Eastern markets generated a low demand, while Russia which was fourth largest jewellery market in 2012 has a growth tendency in demand. Customer jewellery demand increased by 20% with value of $183.9 billion and reached to 3,757 tonnes during the first three quarters 2013. The most growth in demand came from Turkey and Middle East region.\nGreenwood and Steiner (2011) pointed out that the biggest effect on gold jewellery was the period of worldwide recession 2008-2009. Demand on jewellery shrank by 9% in 2008 and 20% in 2009. Moreover, that time demonstrated negative impact on spending in the USA and western markets.\n3.2\tInvestment demand\nThe World Gold Council argues that gold investment had represented as strong growth source in demand, since 2003. However, in 2012 investment demand significantly declined as result of divergence between the retail and institutional investor\u2019s behaviour. Greenwood and Steiner (2011) point out that investment demand can be split into retail investments, including the purchase and hoarding of gold bars and coins, medals and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and similar products. During period from 2001 to 2010, retail investors were responsible for 14% of global gold demand, and ETFs for 6%. Wang, Hussein and Adnan (2010) discuss that demand for gold ETFs showed the higher growth rate than industrial consume or jewellery, in 2009.\nFigure 3\nGold investment demand (tonnes)\nSource: World Gold Council Report\nFigure 3 shows gold investment demand during 2012 and first three quarters of 2013. Total gold ETFs demand in 2012 rose by 137.8 tonnes, while during first three quarters of 2013 market saw a big reversal in which demand fell by 697.4 tonnes. The total demand for bars and coins and physical bars continues to growth and tends to be as long term holders argues Dove (2011). According to the World Gold Council, over the first nine months of 2013 big growth in demand for bars and coins were generated in Middle East. The strong performance has been also in Turkey and Egypt, whereas demand in western market and the United States shown fall.\n3.3\tSupply\nBaur and McDermot (2010) note that gold supplies are relatively inelastic, owing to the difficult extraction process and the tedious establishment of new mines. However, gold supply stays relatively stable, while the gold demand is rapidly changing in response to global economic events. According to the World Gold Council, supply coming from gold mine production, recycled gold and central banks sales of gold. In 2012 the largest producers of gold were: China, Australia, the United States, Russia and South Africa. Figure 4 shows that total gold supply has been growing since 2006, reaching a record of 120 million ounces in 2011 or 4,511.85 metric tonnes.7\nFigure 4\nGold supply over the period from 2000 to 2012\nTotal gold supply\nMine production\tRecycled gold\nSource: DataStream Thomson Routers\n7\tJames, L. 2012. Gold Supply Crunch is coming? Chief Metals &amp; Mining Investment Strategist\nHowever, in 2012 gold supply has been decreased to 4,494.67 metric tonnes. Mine production falls to a 10-years low in 2008, while recycled gold supply shown growth. In 2012, the mine production increased to 2,860 metric tonnes, since 2000, while the recycle gold had declined to 1,633.7 metric tonnes, since 2009. For years, central banks were net sellers of gold. However, in 2009 the first time central banks became the net buyers of gold bullion, since 1988. In 2012 net purchases of gold by central banks around the world was 500 metric tonnes. Greenwood and Steiner (2011) find that during 2002-2010, gold production was responsible for 60% of supply recycled gold for 30% of supply and central bank sales was responsible for 10%.\n4.\tData and Methodology\nIn the analysis I use observations from the first day of the month over period of 13 years starting from January 2000 to December 2013. Gold price, silver price and also six gold ETFs and five silver ETFs are as dependent variables and I analyze the effect of several macroeconomic factors such as: currency, stock market, interest rate, inflation rate, crude oil and volatility. Data description can be seen in Table 3. Table 4 describes the features of ETFs sample.\nTable 3\nData sources for gold variables\nFactors effecting the dependent variables\tIndependent variables\nCurrency\tUS dollar Index\nStock market\tS&amp;P 500 price Index\nInterest rate\tUS LIBOR 1 Week\nInflation rate\tUS CPI Inflation\nCrude oil\tWTI Cushing U$/BBL\nVolatility\tCBOE Gold Volatility Index\nSource: DataStream Thomson Routers\nFor the further calculations I will work with monthly logarithmic rate of return for all gold variables, gold ETFs and silver ETF except interest rate and VIX (volatility). The rate of return is computed in the following way:\nR,. t = ln |~\u2014I\t(1)\nWhere refers return of variable j at time t and is the price for variable j at time t, Pj, (\u2022 t+! \u25a0) is the price for variable j at time (t+1).\nTable 4\nExchange -Traded Funds Sample\nPanel A:\tGold Exchange-Traded Funds\t\t\t\t\t\nTicker Symbol\tShort name\tLaunch date\tLeverage\tP target\tAnnual free\tHoldings\nGLD\tSPDR GOLD SHARES\t19-Nov-04\tLong\t1\t0.40%\tPhysical gold\nIAU\tISHARES GOLD TRUST\t21-Jan- 05\tLong\t1\t0.25%\tPhysical gold\nDGL\tPOWERSHARES DB GOLD FD.\t5-Jan-07\tLong\t1\t0.79%\tSwaps Futures\nGDX\tMARKET VECTORS GD.MINERALS ETF\t22-May-06\tLong\t1\t0.55%\tStocks\nPHAU\tETFS MTL.SECS.PHYC.(LON) GOLD U$\t24-Apr-07\tLong\t1\t0.39%\tPhysical gold\nGBS\tGOLD BULLION SECS.(LON) ETF\t15-Apr-04\tLong\t1\t0.40%\tPhysical gold\nPanel B:\tSilver Exchange-Traded Funds\t\t\t\t\t\nTicker Symbol\tShort name\tLaunch date\tLeverage\tP target\tAnnual free\tHoldings\nSLV\tISHARES SILVER TRUST\t28-Apr-06\tLong\t1\t0.50%\tPhysical Silver\nDBS\tPOWERSHARES DB.SIL.FD\t5-Jan-07\tLong\t1\t0.79%\tSwaps, Futures\nPHAG\tETFS METAL SECS.

The Ordinary Least Square (OLS) is statistical technic was used to examine an effect of the several independent variables on the dependent variable. The model is as follow:\nYj =P1+P2 X2j+P3 X3j +.+ P n Xnj+\u00a3j -for\tJ = (2,\t3-n)\t(2)\nWhere, Yj refers to the value of the dependent variable, X (2,3, . . n) refers to the values of independent variables that explained by Yj , p is a constant value and p (2,3..n) are coefficients for independent variables, \u00a3j is the error term. Standardized beta for an independent variable indicates the expected increase or decrease in the dependent variable, in standard deviation units, given a one standard deviation increase in independent variable with all other independent variables held constant, explained Nathans, Oswald and Nimon (2012). Later I present standardized beta (\t:\nSDX.\n, for J = (2,3...n)\t(3)\nAll statistical calculations have been performed with help of STATA 12.0 version.\n5.\tEmpirical Findings\n5.1\tStructural breaks for Gold and Silver Prices\nFigure 5\nPrice of Gold Bullion on LBM over the period from January 2000 to December 2013\nFigure 5 shows movement of the gold bullion price per ounce. Figure indicates that the bull market on gold price begin from April 2001 and for the next ten years rose very fast. During finance crisis 2008-2009 there was big downturn, when gold price fell from $981.35 to $727.35. But then subsequently recovers all the losses with the price $1,826.35 per ounce in September 2011 on the London Bullion Market (LBM). The second downturn occurred over period from October 2012 to December 2013, the gold prices showed dramatic fall from $1,777 to $1,227 per ounce.\nFigure 6\nPrice of Silver Bullion on LBM over the period from January 2000 to December 2013\n60\nFigure 6 shows movement of silver bullion price per ounce. The silver price from July 2003 indicates the dramatic growth until May 2011 with the highest price reached of $48.7 per ounce on the London Bullion Market (LBM). During the Great Recession of 2008-2009 was first downturn when the silver price went from $20.16 to $10.05, and then started increasing even faster. Over the period from May 2011 to December 2013 occurs next fall of silver price from $48.7 to $19.75 per ounce. On Figures 4 and 5, we can see that over 13 years prices of gold and silver generally move in the same direction.\n5.2\tDescriptive Statistics\nTable 5\nSummary statistics\nVariables\tObs.\tMean\tStd.

The S&amp;P 500 has risen from January 2000 to March 2008 to almost 0.93 and showed the higher correlation with return of gold. Market crash always associate with the shocks and during the Great Recession 2008 return of market stock falls to almost (-0.64). In December 2013 the S&amp;P 500 remains negative and indicates there is no correlation with return of gold.\nCorrelation between the return of gold and VIX over the period from January 2000 to December 2013 has range from 0.004 to (-0.006) respectively. The large decline occurred in\nJuly 2007, correlation decreased from 0.002 to (-0.006), but in June 2009 increased to 0.004. The second downturn was in October 2012 to almost (-0.001). Thus, there is no correlation between return of gold volatility and VIX. Correlation between return of gold and interest rate from January 2000 to November 2010 was close to zero. Afterwards, we can see the first fast drop to (-0.33) in August 2011 and the second downturn in September 2013 from 0.09 to (0.39). The December 2013 correlation between return of gold and interest rate has gone from (-0.38) to 0.15 and indicates weak correlation. The first downturn in correlation between the return of gold and inflation rate occurs in June 2006 from 0.004 to (-0.014), but in October 2011 had shown increasing to almost 0.06. The December 2013 correlation remains positive but significant low and indicates that return of gold do not influenced by inflation rate. The first downturn in correlation between the return of gold and return of crude oil occurs in December 2005 from 0.09 to almost (-0.32). In March 2011, correlation decreased from 0.26 to almost (-0.14). To December 2013, return of crude oil was positive and showed weak correlation between gold.\nThe correlation between return of gold and return of US dollar, during 13 years ranges from (-\n1.75) to 1.12. We can observe strong decrease from (-0.10) to almost (-1.75) in August 2008. In September 2011 correlation increased to almost 1.12. However, in December 2013 return of US dollar decreased to almost (-0.57) and has shown negative correlation with return of gold.\nFigure 7\nRolling Window Regression for gold\nOn Figure 8, we can see rolling R-squared estimation for gold of 30 days moving window over period from January 2000 to December 2013. The R-squared for the return of S&amp;P 500 was very volatile in range from 0.004 to 0.13, indicates that during 13 years change in stock market not cause of the change in return of gold. The same we can say about VIX with coefficient R-squared in range from 0.002 to 0.13. The R-squared for interest rate was in range from 0.006 to almost 0.25, while inflation rate in range from 0.0003 to 0.17 indicates that movements of interest rate and inflation rate do not impact gold much. R-squared for US dollar to September 2008 increased to almost 0.40, but to December 2013 occurred fall to 0.03 and indicates that return of US dollar cannot explain movement of return of gold. R-squared for return of crude oil over long period was in range from 0.005 to almost 0.30 indicates low correlation between returns of crude oil and gold.\nFigure 8\nRolling R-squared for gold\njun/13\n6.\tConclusion\nIn this study we examined the role of gold as an investment. In order to understand whether gold is a safe or speculative investment, were analyse the factors that may affect the prices of gold, silver, six gold ETFs and five silver ETFs. The relevant factors are: S&amp;P 500, VIX (volatility), interest rate, inflation, US dollar and crude oil returns, from the period from January 2000 to December 2013.\nThe empirical findings find a weak negative correlation between returns of gold and US dollar. The positive correlation occurred between returns of gold and silver. Whereas weak positive correlation is between return of gold and inflation, return of crude oil and return of gold. The return of S&amp;P 500, VIX and interest rate do not correlate with return of gold.\nThe regression analysis in the study was performed by using Least Square Method, standard errors are robust. We found that return of S&amp;P 500, VIX, interest rate and inflation do not have significant relationship to the returns of gold and silver. The return of US dollar has negative effect on gold and silver returns. When the return of US dollar appreciates (depreciates), this drives the return of gold down (up). The variation of one standard deviation in the return of US dollar, it is expected decrease in variation of returns of gold by 0.21 and silver by 0.16 standard deviations. The return of crude oil has no relationship with return of gold, but it has a weak affect the return of silver at the 10% significant level.\nFinally, I checked whether the return of gold had strong affect the return of gold ETFs and the return of silver influences the return of silver ETFs at the 1% significant level. The variation in one standard deviation in the return of gold, it is expected strong variation in return of MARKET VECTORS GD.MINERALS ETF by 1.645. Whereas the variation in one standard deviations in return of silver, it is expected strong variation in returns of ETFS.CMOD SECS.SILVER ETFS by 1.024 and METAL SECS. PHYSICAL SILVER by 1.032 standard deviations.\nThe return of S&amp;P 500, volatility, interest rate, US dollar and crude oil returns do not reflect the changes in return of the gold ETFs. However, inflation has weak affect the returns of POWERSHARES DB GOLD FD, MARKET VECTORS. GD MINERALS ETF, and ETF MLT SECS. PHYC (LON) GOLD U$, and GOLD BULLION SECS. (LON) ETF USD at the 10% significant level.\nThe return of few silver ETFs such as: POWERSHARES DB. SIL.FD, ETFS METAL SECS PHYSICAL SILVER, ZKB SILVER ETF and ETFS CMOD SECS SILVER are influenced by inflation at the 1% significant level. The variation of the inflation rate will cause immediate changes in returns of these ETFs. Meanwhile, the return of crude oil has strong effect on the returns of ETFS METAL SECS PHYSICAL SILVER, ZKB SILVER ETF and ETFS CMOD SECS SILVER, while it has a weak effect on the return of POWERSHARES DB SILV FD at the 10% significant level. The inflation and return of crude oil do not affect the return of ISHARES SILVER TRUST. The remaining variables are not statistically significant and their changes do not reflect the changes in the return of silver ETFs.\nIn summary, gold and silver are safe investments which provide diversification benefits for investment portfolio. Gold ETFs and silver ETFs are also an option for investors who seek the benefits from diversification, despite the fact that they are a new investment vehicle in the finance market.\nHowever, the analyzed precious metals have ability to hedge against a weaker US dollar. Investors tend to invest more in gold when the US dollar depreciates which leads to higher prices for precious metals. However, when the US dollar appreciates, investors trust more in paper money rather than gold and silver. Moreover, gold and silver cannot provide strong hedge against inflation. But we believe that investment in gold and silver will provide to investors a possibility to protect their wealth in case of future possible inflation. Investment in gold ETFs provides a weak hedge against inflation. Whereas silver ETFs has ability hedge against inflation and hedge against adverse movements in oil prices.\nBibliography\nAgyei-Ampomah, S., Gounopoulos, D. &amp; Mazouz, K. 2014.
