Rector at U.C. \nBerkeley, and I thank him for inspiring me to learn more about this unbelievable deep \nfield of study. I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Renato L. Prado, for always being \nhelpful and kind. His guidance allowed me to narrow my broad research interests and \neventually focus on a topic suitable for a master\u2019s degree. A special thanks to Dr. Choon \nPark for sharing his expertise and knowledge in using ParkSEIS\u00a9 and in understanding \nthe MASW method. I am thankful to Dr. Julian Ivanov and the staff at the Kansas \nGeological Survey for their help when I attended the SurfSeis\u00a9 workshop in 2015. A \nword of gratitude to Rodrigo F. de Lucena for allowing me to use his dispersion function \ncode, and for sharing his knowledge. Dr. Carlos A. Mendon\u00e7a gave me the knowledge in \nthe field of inversion to be able to create my own inversion code, for which I am very \nthankful. I am also thankful for Dr. Rodolfo M. Mendes sharing his geotechnical \ninvestigation for use in this research. I want to thank the faculty and staff at IAG-USP, \nwho have always been very resourceful and helpful. In addition, I am very grateful to my \nfriends and family who have always supported me and made me feel at home in S\u00e3o \nPaulo. \n\nIt is common amongst physicists, scientists, and mathematicians to name theories with \nthe name of the originator as a sign of respect (i.e. Rayleigh wave, Love wave, Jacobian \nmatrix, etc.). However, it must be recognized that much of the accumulated knowledge in \nthese fields has been passed down from countless individuals whom history has forgotten. \nTherefore, I would like to thank, more than any individual, the human spirit of curiosity \nand the desire to share new knowledge.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nii \n \n\n \n\nAbstract \n \n\nThis study seeks to prove the usefulness of the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves \n(MASW) method as complementary data to conventional geotechnical and geological \ndata in the characterization of areas of landslide risk.  The setting is located in a low \nincome housing neighborhood in the city of Campos do Jord\u00e3o, state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. \nThe area was devastated by numerous landslides between December 1999 to January \n2000 after heavy rainfall in the area.  The landslides in this area are known to be shallow. \nRefraction and MASW surveys were performed in this research and then processed to \nobtain seismic velocity profiles of the subsurface. In order to better identify the \nfundamental mode of the Rayleigh wave, separate surveys isolating the vertical and radial \ncomponents of the Rayleigh wave were performed. By comparing the inverted shear \nwave (??) and compressional wave (??) profiles with the already known geotechnical and \ngeological data of the site, a better understanding of the geological interfaces that \nconstitute the landslide prone area is obtained.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\niii \n \n\n \n\nResumo \n \n\nEste estudo busca demonstrar a aplicabilidade do m\u00e9todo de an\u00e1lise multicanal de ondas \nsuperficiais (MASW) e a import\u00e2ncia da integra\u00e7\u00e3o de seus resultados com os da \ninvestiga\u00e7\u00e3o geol\u00f3gica-geot\u00e9cnica para a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas sujeitas a deslizamentos \nde terra. O local de estudo situa-se em uma \u00e1rea residencial com prec\u00e1rias condi\u00e7\u00f5es de \ninfraestrutura urbana na cidade de Campos do Jord\u00e3o, estado de S\u00e3o Paulo, Brasil. Na \n\u00e1rea houve v\u00e1rios epis\u00f3dios de escorregamento entre dezembro de 1999 e janeiro de 2000 \nap\u00f3s a ocorr\u00eancia de chuvas intensas. Os escorregamentos nesta \u00e1rea s\u00e3o classificados \ncomo rasos. Nesta pesquisa foram realizados ensaios de s\u00edsmica de refra\u00e7\u00e3o e MASW e \ngerados perfis e se\u00e7\u00f5es de velocidade de propaga\u00e7\u00e3o das ondas s\u00edsmicas. Para obter uma \nmelhor identifica\u00e7\u00e3o do modo fundamental da onda Rayleigh foram realizadas diferentes \naquisi\u00e7\u00f5es visando ao registro das componentes vertical e radial do movimento da onda. \nA integra\u00e7\u00e3o dos perfis de velocidades da onda cisalhante (VS) e da onda compressional \n(VP) com os dados geol\u00f3gicos e geot\u00e9cnicos obtidos anteriormente permitiu aprimorar o \nmapeamento das interfaces geol\u00f3gicas importantes para o estudo dos processos de \nescorregamento do local. \n\n  \n\n\n\niv \n \n\n \n\nCONTENTS \n\n \n1 Introduction ............................................................................................ 1-3 \n\n1.1 Motives .................................................................................................. 2 \n\n1.2 Objectives ........................................................................................... 2-3 \n\n1.3 Approach ............................................................................................... 3 \n\n2 Theoretical Background ...................................................................... 4-35 \n\n2.1 Historical Overview of the Development of Near-Surface Seismic        \n.

Because the \nproperties of seismic waves are related to certain properties of the media through which \nthe waves travel, these properties can be deduced from the observation and measurement \nof seismic wave propagation.  \n\nIn a region prone to shallow landslide danger, obtaining the properties of shallow soils \nand sediments can play an important role in understanding the subsurface and potentially \nhelping to minimize risk to local inhabitants. There are many variables that may influence \nthe occurrence of a landslide, such as meteorological variables (i.e. rain intensity, \nduration, etc.), geological variables (i.e. mineralogical composition, weathering, etc.), \ngeotechnical variables (i.e. moisture content, water level, etc.), seismicity variables (i.e. \nsoil stiffness, damping ratio, etc.), and human variables (i.e. poor standards of \nconstruction, man-made debris, etc.).  Some of these variables are directly and indirectly \nrelated, and many can belong to more than one category.   \n\nGeotechnical drilling and lab testing can obtain near-surface soil and sediment properties.  \nHowever, this practice is not only costly and time consuming but is limited to sampling \nvery small sections as wide as the borehole and interpolating between them. For the cost \nof lower resolution, possible ambiguities of solution sets, and obtaining only a limited set \nof properties which can only indirectly relate to geological and geotechnical properties, \ngeophysical methods offer the following advantages: (1) flexibility and high investigation \nspeed, (2) non-invasive testing with the ability to determine the internal structure of the \nsubsurface, (3) investigating a large volume of the subsurface, and (4) being relatively \nlow-cost (Jongmans &amp; Garambois, 2007). Although there exist various geophysical \nmethods to obtain soil and sediment properties, seismic methods can nearly always \ndetermine the internal structure of materials in a slope; and furthermore, seismic \nrefraction has been a standard tool for geotechnical investigations for many years (Hack, \n2000). There are many examples of seismic refraction being used in post-landslide \nreconnaissance investigations, as in Bogoslovsky et al. (1977), Caris et al. (1991), Godio \net al. (2005), Glade et al. (2004), Spillmann et al. (2007), and Willenberg et al. (2008). In \nrecent years, surface wave analysis has become a popular seismic method and is often \nused in combination with seismic refraction, as they can share the same geophone array \n(Havenith et al., 2000, Jongmans et al., 2009, Grandjean et al., 2011). Attempts at joint \ninversion of refraction and surface wave analysis have also been performed (Ivanov, \n2002). Investigations performed in landslide-prone areas using only surface wave \nanalysis (Coccia et al., 2010) are also seen in the literature. \n\nHowever, many published studies using seismic techniques in landslide regions are \ntypically located in non-tropical regions and often in mountainous alpine environments, \nwhere sharp velocity contrasts are common at the near surface. In contrast, in tropical \nregions intensive chemical weathering leads to the formation of a thick weathering crust \n\n\n\nCh. 1 - Introduction \n \n\n \n2 \n\nover the bedrock (Chamley, 1990). This thick layer of weathering crust can make near-\nsurface seismic investigations more difficult by reducing sharp contrasts in geological \nmaterial at the near surface, and therefore sharp contrasts of seismic properties (i.e. \nstiffness, wave velocity). Since many seismic methods rely on the assumption that the \nsubsurface is layered, this thick weathering crust may provide a challenge for reliable \ndata processing and inversion.   \n\nFurthermore, surface wave analysis for the purpose of near surface geotechnical \ninvestigation (i.e. shear wave velocity inversion) is currently under rapid evolution, as the \nmethod still suffers from some issues preventing reliable inversions for a variety of \nconditions (Socco et al. 2000).  \n\nThis study provides an opportunity to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of \nsurface wave analysis techniques to determine the near surface seismic properties of a \ntropical region prone to shallow landslides and to discuss ideas to improve these near \nsurface seismic methods.   \n\n \n\n1.1 Motives \n \n\nThis research seeks to contribute to the problem of understanding the subsurface of \nterrain prone to shallow landslides and to understand the potential contribution of the \nmultichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method to this end. Furthermore, the \nimportance of a-priori information in the MASW inversion process is also studied to \ninvestigate the viability of the current MASW inversion methods, by means of \ncommercial software SurfSeis?, and ParkSEIS?.  \n\nIt is hoped that this research will help develop, promote, and understand geophysical \ntechniques that can aid geotechnical engineers in various engineering problems that \nrequire an understanding of the subsurface. It is the opinion of the author that advances in \nnear surface geophysical techniques may revolutionize the practice of geotechnical site \ninvestigations. By giving the engineer more tools to measure the subsurface we can \nexpect a greater degree of accuracy in the assessment of vital geotechnical parameters, \nwhich can be of immense importance in various engineering projects.  \n\n1.2 Objectives \n \n\nThe primary objective of this study is to test the multichannel analysis of surface waves \n(MASW) (Park et al., 1999) method in an environment that challenges the underlying \nassumptions of the method. The study site is located in a mountainous tropical \nenvironment with challenging topography and a very thick weathered layer (residual soil \nand saprolite).  \n\nWe can consider the secondary objective to be the exploration of MASW inversion \nresults when considering a-priori data. In this study a-priori data is assumed from existing \n\n\n\nCh. 1 - Introduction \n \n\n \n3 \n\ngeotechnical and geological data as well as other seismic methods performed on site \n(Seismic Refraction, Love Wave, and Passive MASW surveys).  \n\nThe key deliverable of this project is the near-surface shear wave velocity profile of the \nstudy site.  \n\n \n\n1.3 Approach \n \n\nAs explained in section 1.1, the MASW method is the focus of this study.  \n\nThe general approach of this study can be divided into the following steps: \n\n? Gather all relevant geotechnical and geological data available for the site and \nsurrounding region. \n\n? Perform refraction and surface wave investigations at the site.  \n? Process refraction and surface wave (excluding the active MASW survey) data \n\nseparately, and verify consistency.  \n? Develop an a-priori model with a combination of geotechnical/geological data and \n\nseismic inversion (excluding the active MASW survey) results.  \n? Invert MASW (Rayleigh wave) data both considering a-priori data and not, and \n\ncompare results.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n4 \n\nChapter 2 - Theoretical Background \n \n\n2.1 Historical Overview of the Development of Near-\nSurface Seismic Methods \n \n\nIn the mid-to-late nineteenth century, the first seismic exploration methods were \ndeveloped from early earthquake studies. 1846 saw Robert Mallet be the first man to use \nan \u201cartificial\u201d energy source in a seismic experiment; he also became the first man to use \nthe term \u201cseismology\u201d.  August Schmidt created the travel time-distance graph in 1888 \nfor the determination of seismic velocities; this graph is fundamental to many modern \nseismic methods.  G.K. Knott explained the phenomenon of seismic propagation, \nrefraction, and reflection in 1899.  The combination of two world wars, a boom in the oil \n&amp; gas industry, and the invention of the computer made the twentieth century an \nexceptional period of growth for applied seismology.  By the 1920s seismic reflection \nhad become widely used for the exploration of hydrocarbons and soon became the \ndominant method for the exploration of oil and gas throughout the world.  Seismic \nrefraction methods were also being developed with the invention of the \u2018Plus-Minus\u2019 \nmethod by J.G. Hagedoorn in 1959 and the \u2018reciprocal method\u2019 by L.V. Hawkins in 1961.  \nR. Jones was among the first to propose engineering applications in surface-wave \nanalysis (Jones, 1958, 1962).  Soon a new method, named the spectral analysis of surface \nwaves (SASW) (Nazarian &amp; Stokoe, 1984), made surface-wave analysis popular among \nthe engineering community, and is still popular to the present day (Socco, Foti, &amp; Boiero, \n2010).  And more recently, the multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) method, \ndeveloped by researchers from the Kansas Geological Survey (Park et al., 1999), has \nbecome a popular way to analyze surface waves while using the same survey \nconfiguration of a common refraction survey. Much of the historical information \nprovided in this paragraph is based on (Reynolds, 2011).   \n\nModern applied seismology is divided into three branches: refraction, reflection, and \nsurface wave analysis.  Reflection analysis is the most powerful method for oil \nexploration due to its ability to image deep structures.  Refraction and surface wave \nanalysis, however, have been consistently used for near surface applications useful to \nengineers interested in the shallow subsurface. These are the two methods used in this \nstudy.    \n\n   \n\n2.2 Surface Waves in an Infinite-Elastic-Isotropic-\nHomogeneous Half-Space \n \n\nThis section reviews the most common derivation of Rayleigh waves seen in many \nseismology textbooks (Aki &amp; Richards, 1980; Chapman, 2004; Lay &amp; Wallace, 1995; \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n5 \n\nShearer, 2009; Stein, 2009; Ud\u00edas, 1999). The Rayleigh wave derivation presented in this \nsection is mostly influenced by Kramer (2002). Assuming a homogeneous half space \nwith no layering greatly simplifies the Rayleigh wave problem, but it is important to note \nthat although many characteristics are shared between Rayleigh waves in homogeneous \nmedia and layered media, there are also some major differences such as normal modes \nand dispersion. Definitions of elastic moduli and related terms can be found in Appendix \nA. \n\n \n\n2.2.1 The Rayleigh wave  \n \n\nThere is only one kind of surface wave that can exist in an infinite-elastic-isotropic-\nhomogeneous half-space, the Rayleigh Wave. Let us assume a two-dimensional space \nwhere ? is the vertical axis and ? is the horizontal axis.   \n\nLet us define horizontal displacement (??) and vertical displacement (??) as the \nfollowing differential equations,   \n\n                                                          ?? =\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n??\n\n??\n                                (2.1) \n\n                                                          ?? =\n??\n\n??\n?\n\n??\n\n??\n                      (2.2) \n\n \n\nNow we must define the harmonic (or potential) functions ?  and ? . In order to do this, \nwe must introduce the wave equation for a two dimensional elastic solid, and then we can \ndefine volumetric strain and rotational strain in terms of ?  and ? . \n\nIntroducing the wave equations for two-dimensions (?,?) in terms of stress, \n\n?\n????\n\n???\n=\n\n???\n\n??\n+\n\n????\n\n??\n+\n\n????\n\n??\n  \n\n?\n????\n\n???\n=\n\n????\n\n??\n+\n\n????\n\n??\n+\n\n???\n\n??\n  \n\n \n\nNow we can write the two wave equations in terms of strain by using Hooke\u2019s law, \n\n?\n????\n\n???\n= (? + ?)\n\n???\n\n??\n+ ?????  \n\n?\n????\n\n???\n= (? + ?)\n\n???\n\n??\n+ ?????  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n6 \n\n \n\n \n\nNow let us define volumetric strain and rotational strain in terms of ?  and ? , \n\n 2? ?????????? ?????? = ?? = ??? + ??? = \n???\n\n??\n+\n\n???\n\n??\n=\n\n?\n\n??\n?\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n??\n\n??\n? +\n\n                                                                                     \n?\n\n??\n?\n??\n\n??\n?\n\n??\n\n??\n? =\n\n???\n\n???\n+\n\n???\n\n???\n= ???  \n\n?????????? ?????? ?? ? ? ? ????? = 2?? = 2?\n?\n\n?\n?\n???\n\n??\n?\n\n???\n\n??\n?? =\n\n?\n\n??\n?\n??\n\n??\n+\n\n??\n\n??\n? ?\n\n                                                                                  \n?\n\n??\n?\n??\n\n??\n?\n\n??\n\n??\n? =\n\n???\n\n???\n+\n\n???\n\n???\n   = ???   \n\n \n\nNow we can write the two wave equations in terms of ?  and ?  by using the definition ?? \nand ?? from Equations 2.1 and 2.2, \n\n?\n?\n\n??\n?\n???\n\n???\n? + ?\n\n?\n\n??\n?\n???\n\n???\n? = (? + 2?)\n\n?\n\n??\n(??? )+ ?\n\n?\n\n??\n(??? )  \n\n?\n?\n\n??\n?\n???\n\n???\n? ? ?\n\n?\n\n??\n?\n???\n\n???\n? = (? + 2?)\n\n?\n\n??\n(??? )? ?\n\n?\n\n??\n(??? )  \n\n \n\nNow we can simultaneously solve these two wave equations to obtain, \n\n???\n\n???\n=\n\n????\n\n?\n??? = ??\n\n????   \n\n???\n\n???\n=\n\n?\n\n?\n??? = ???\n\n? ???   \n\n \n\nAssuming that the wave is harmonic and propagates with the Rayleigh wave velocity, we \ncan express ?  and ?  as, \n\n? = F(z)??(??????)  \n\n? = G(z)??(??????)  \n\n \n\nwhere the functions F(z) and G(z) describe the variation of volumetric strain and \nrotational strain with depth. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n7 \n\n \n\nInserting these two harmonic functions into the solutions to the wave equations yields, \n\n?\n??\n\n??\n? ?(?)= ???\n\n??(?)+\n???(?)\n\n???\n  \n\n?\n??\n\n???\n? ?(?)= ???\n\n??(?)+\n???(?)\n\n???\n  \n\n \n\nand rearranging these two equations gives, \n\n???\n\n???\n? ???\n\n? ?\n??\n\n??\n??? = 0  \n\n???\n\n???\n? ???\n\n? ?\n??\n\n???\n? ?? = 0  \n\n \n\nThe general solution of these two equations is as follows,  \n\n?(?)= ???\n??? + ???\n\n?? \n\n?(?)= ???\n??? + ???\n\n?? \n\n \n\nwhere the arbitrary constants ? and ? are defined as,  \n\n \n\n? = ???\n? ?\n\n??\n\n??\n?   \n\n? = ???\n? ?\n\n??\n\n???\n?   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n8 \n\nWe can see that the general solution contains a linear combination of two types of \nexponentials. \n\n \n\n             Contribution of ??and ??

We will begin this section by reviewing normal mode theory by \nusing the wave solution to a finite elastic rote fixed at both ends. Next the Love wave \nproblem is solved for the simplest two-layer model. And finally, a very brief overview of \nthe Rayleigh wave solution is given as a detailed derivation will be quite lengthy and not \nnecessary for much of the dispersive and modal characteristics are very similar to the \nLove wave solution. In practice, a layered homogeneous elastic model is a useful \napproximation for many near-surface situations (Xu et al., 2006).  \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Normal Mode Theory  \n \n\nWhen elastic waves propagate in a medium with infinite dimensions there exist no modes, \nand when elastic waves propagate in a medium with finite dimensions, there exist an \ninfinite number of modes. By introducing layers, we effectively create a finite dimension \nspace, and therefore an infinite number of modes.  \n\nLet us understand normal mode theory by analyzing vibrations in a finite elastic rod \n(adapted from Ud\u00edas, 1999).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 - Cylindrical coordinates of an elastic rod. \nUd\u00edas, 1999. \n\nFigure 2.9 - Consider the rod with fixed \nends.

Because Love wave dispersion and modal behavior is very similar to \nthat of Rayleigh waves and as the purpose of this section is to demonstrate the dispersive \nand modal characteristics of Rayleigh waves in layered media, the majority of the \nderivation will be bypassed and rather the most important characteristics of Rayleigh \nwaves in layered media will be discussed. \n\nThe Rayleigh eigenvalue problem is more complicated to solve because it involves both \nP and SV waves, which are the two waves that essentially constitute a Rayleigh wave.  \nThe most common way to solve it is by the transfer matrix method, after Thomson (1950) \nand Haskel (1953) (Pei, 2007). However, there are other alternative matrix methods such \nas the stiffness matrix method after Kausel and Roesset (1981) and the reflection-\ntransmission coefficient matrix method after Kennet (1984) and Luco and Aspel (1983). \nNumerical methods such as finite-element method (Lysmer and Drake, 1972), finite-\ndifference method (Boore, 1972), and numerical integral method (Takeuchi and Saito, \n1972) can also solve the Rayleigh eigenvalue problem (Pei, 2007).

Radon \n(1917) and applied by A. Cormack in 1963 (Ud\u00edas, 1999), and has since been used in \nmany fields. Seismic tomography applied to study the Earth\u2019s interior was developed in \nthe mid-1970s (aki et al., 1976, apud Ud\u00edas, 1999). Refraction tomography techniques are \nessentially travel time tomography methods applied to refracted waves. As with the finite \nelement method, tomography separates a region into blocks or sub-regions, and in the \ncase of travel time tomography the residual (or difference) of the observed and modeled \nwave arrival times at each sub-region is the object of the inversion process. Since \nobserved data is typically only available on the surface, the aim of travel time \ntomography is to explain the residuals (or incoherence between the model and observed \ndata) through velocity distribution inside the earth, where a higher concentration of ray \npaths adds more confidence. \n\nFigure 2.19 \u2013 Rayleigh wave dispersion curves for the fundamental mode \n(????? ?? ???) and three higher modes.

First an initial model of seismic \nvelocities is generated in accordance with the source/geophone arrangement employed to \nrecord the refracted waves. Subsequently, an inversion algorithm seeks to minimize the \ndifference of the residuals by making adjustments to the model until a solution is found, \nbe it local or global. \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRefraction tomography is not subject to the same constraints imposed by the simplifying \nassumptions of conventional refraction methods such as the delay time and generalized \nreciprocal methods; refraction tomography performs well in many situations where \nconventional methods fail, e.g., where lateral or vertical gradients compose a significant \ncomponent of the velocity structure (Sheehan et al., 2005).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.20 \u2013 Ray paths crossing a gridded region in a \nstudy of seismic tomography of the earth.

(2000) and using the Fresnel \nvolume approach proposed by Watanabe et al. (1999). A Fresnel volume considers not \nonly the ray path as influencing the seismic signal recorded by a geophone but also takes \ninto account the structure around the ray path.

(1999), is a seismic method which exploits the dispersive nature of Rayleigh waves (in \nlayered media) to invert a one-dimensional model of the earth (that can be interpolated \ninto a two-dimensional profile) in terms of the P wave velocity, SV wave velocity, \ndensity, and thickness of each layer.  The MASW method is most commonly used with a \nlinear geophone array, as shown in Figure 2.23, with an active source such as a \nsledgehammer. However, roadside and passive MASW surveys are also common, where \na two-dimensional array is preferable for passive surveys to accurately locate the source \nazimuth. And although MASW is typically used to record the more energetic vertical \ncomponent of the Rayleigh wave, it can be equally effective in measuring the horizontal \n(or radial) component, which may be useful in further defining the fundamental or higher \nmodes. It is also important to note that there exist a variety of ways to analyze surface \nwaves by measuring seismic wave arrivals using an array of geophones, and therefore the \nterm MASW will be used exclusively in referring to the general procedure of Rayleigh \nwave analysis used by Park et al. (1999) and implemented by the commercial software \npackages SurfSeis? v.4 and ParkSEIS? v.1.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.23 \u2013 An illustration of an active source MASW field survey using a linear geophone array.

The lower the seismic velocity of the material (i.e. the softness), the \nmore important it is to have a lower frequency geophone (see Table 2.1).  Typically, \ngeophones with natural frequencies lower than 4.5 Hz are not used, as costs tend to \nincrease exponentially for geophones with natural frequencies lower than the relatively \ncommon 4.5 Hz. \n\nNumber of Geophones: \n\nIn a two station (or geophone) survey (i.e. SASW) the geophone spacing determines both \nthe maximum recordable wavelength and the minimum recordable wavelength; in other \nwords, two station surveys can record only one wavelength. With the multichannel \napproach (MASW), there are a variety of recordable wavelengths as there are a variety of \ngeophone distances to consider. The larger the number of geophones the larger the \nvariety of recordable wavelengths. However, a higher number of geophones alone does \nnot increase the resolution of the dispersion image; this is only achieved by a longer array \nlength (or spread length), which may or may not include more geophones (Park et al., \n2001).   Ultimately, the chosen geophone spacing and array length are what should \ndetermine the number of geophones. \n\nGeophone Spacing: \n\nBecause MASW survey arrays typically have evenly spaced geophones, the spacing \nbetween each geophone essentially determines the minimum recordable wavelength and \ntherefore the minimum invertible depth. Typical values recommended by the KGS range \nanywhere between 0.25 m for very shallow surveys and up to 5 m for deeper surveys \n(Table 2.1).  \n\nArray Length: \n\nThe length of the array determines the largest recordable wavelength of the survey, and \nconsequently the depth of investigation. Furthermore, the resolution of a dispersion \nimage at a given frequency is directly proportional to the product of the length of the \ngeophone array and the frequency (Xia et al., 2005). However, the longer the array length, \nthe greater the area that is assumed to be laterally homogeneous (this is due to the \nfundamental assumption of the two-dimensional Rayleigh wave forward modeling \nschemes that assume a layered medium). Therefore, if a site is known to vary laterally a \nlong array is not recommended, however the maximum depth will be sacrificed with \nshorter array lengths.   \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n30 \n\nFigure 2.25 - A dispersion image illustrating the phase velocity resolution (??), from Xia \net al., 2005. \n\nThe dispersion image resolution is given by the following equation (Xia et al., 2005), \n\n?? = 1/(? \u00d7 ??) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSource Offset: \n\nRayleigh waves require a certain distance to form; this is because a Rayleigh wave is \nessentially a grouping of P and SV waves that form as a results of interactions at the \nsurface interface. The nearest offset from a source that is sufficiently far away to where a \nRayleigh wave can be generated in a simplified two-layered model is given by Equation \n2.13 (Xia et al., 2005).   \n\n                                                 ??(???) =\n??\n\n??\n??\n\n???\n? ?\n\n?\n??\n\n                                                (2.13) \n\nThis equation clearly shows how the distance to which a Rayleigh wave is generated is \nrelated to not just the velocities of the first layer (?? &amp; ???) but also the thickness (?) of \nthe first layer. If we assume that ??/?? is equal to 4, then we see that the minimum offset \nis about h/2 or 50% of the depth to the half-space (or maximum depth of investigation). \nThis is a good rule of thumb to consider when determining the minimum source offset, \nand although Equation 2.13 is based on a two-layer model, it is also valid for a multi-\nlayer model because the reflected P wave energy from the interface of the first two layers \nalways interferes with the direct S wave energy first (Xu et al., 2006).  \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n31 \n\nFigure 2.26 \u2013 An illustration of the optimum offset range \nand how body waves eventually dominate energy of high \nfrequencies after a certain distance.

(1999) defines the near-field effects as the effects which do not allow Rayleigh \nwaves to travel as horizontal plane waves near the source; and likewise, the far-field \neffects are defined as the rapid attenuation of high frequency surface wave energy with \ndistance (see Figure 2.26), eventually allowing body wave energy to dominate. The \nrecommended best practice is to pick a source offset range that is greater than the \nminimum offset (i.e. approximately 0.5 \u00d7 ???? in most cases) and is not too long that \nwill cause far-field effects; the recommended source offsets in Table 1 can be used to \navoid far-field effects in most conditions.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n32 \n\nSource Type: \n\nThere are a variety of sources available to process surface wave data. In general, sources \ncan be divided into passive and active, where passive sources derive from events which \ninduce ground vibrations that are not purposely intended for the survey, and active \nsources are sources of energy which originate from a purposeful release of energy into \nthe ground to induce vibration. Typical examples of passive sources include vehicle \ntraffic, construction work, ocean waves, etc., and typical examples of active sources \ninclude sledgehammer impacts, explosion charges, weight drops, etc.  Sledgehammer \nsources are perhaps the most common type of active source due to the relative ease and \ncost of use. Park et al. (2002) showed that although a 20-lb sledgehammer source \nobtained slightly lower frequency surface wave energy as compared to a 10-lb \nsledgehammer, a rubber-band-aided weight drop with more impact energy actually \nincreased the higher frequency surface wave energy at a particular site. Thus, an increase \nof impact strength does not necessarily increase the amount of surface wave energy at \nlower frequencies (Park et al., 2002).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.2.2 Data Processing \n \n\nBefore the conversion of multichannel records into dispersion images (through slant-\nstack processing) we can improve the seismic data by muting, automatic gain control, \nand/or filtering (Yilmaz, 2001). MASW data processing is essentially the conversion of \nseismic multichannel records (or seismograms) into dispersion images (or overtones). \nThere exist a variety of methods to perform this conversion, such as the pi-omega \ntransformation (McMechan and Yedlin, 1981). However, MASW implements the phase-\nshift method (Park et al., 1998), which achieves a higher resolution that the pi-omega \nmethod (Park et al. 1998).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.2.3 Curve Picking \n \n\nThe next step is to use the dispersion image to accurately find and select points that lie on \nthe dispersion curve of the fundamental mode (and possibly higher modes) of the \nRayleigh wave.   \n\nThis is perhaps the most controversial aspect of MASW as it introduces unquantifiable \nhuman error into the process. An experienced user of the MASW method will recognize \ncertain patterns in the dispersion images and with time confidence can build in the curve \nselection process, however the biggest challenge is the unpredictable site response. It has \nbecome evident through modeling that the fundamental mode is not necessarily the \ndominating mode and the continuity of a signal in the dispersion image does not \nnecessary mean that it belongs to a single mode (Moro, 2015).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.27 \u2013 A visualization of the site investigation, multichannel record, \nand dispersion image that is an output of MASW data processing, from Park, \n2005.  \n\n\n\nCh. 2 \u2013 Theoretical Background \n \n\n \n34 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4.2.4 Inversion \n \n\nThe forward modeling algorithms for both SurfSeis? and ParkSEIS? are based on \nSchwab and Knopoff (1972), which itself is based on the transfer matrix method of \nThomson (1950) and Haskell (1953). Although SurfSeis? is capable of multi-mode \ninversion, it is typically used for fundamental mode inversion as energy is usually \nconcentrated in that mode, making it easier to pick. Furthermore, the fundamental mode \nalways has the lowest Rayleigh wave phase velocities and is the only mode to exist at all \nfrequencies, distinguishing it even further from the other modes.  \n\nThe inversion algorithms differ between SurfSeis? and ParkSEIS?. The algorithm for \nSurfSeis? is based on Xia et al. (1999) whereas the ParkSEIS? algorithm has not been \npublished. Both software packages allow the user to modify certain settings in the \ninversion process, but neither allow modifications to the objective function.   \n\nThe MATLAB\u00ae code written for this research performs inversion using MATLAB\u2019s \nbuilt in minimizer functions such as fmincon and fminsearch. In this code, the objective \nfunction is defined as the Euclidian distance between the picked dispersion curve and a \ndispersion curve that varies with each iteration as parameters are adjusted until a \nminimum is reached.  \n\n          ??? ???? = ???{??????? ???? ????? ? ???????? ???? ???????}            (2.14) \n\nFigure 2.28 \u2013 An illustration of the 3-step procedure after field measurements, data processing, curve fitting, and \ninversion.

However, presumably because SH wave generation is \nmore difficult and SH refraction surveys seldom performed, neither SurfSeis\u00a9 nor \nParkSEIS\u00a9 contain the forward modeling algorithm (also found in Schwab and Knopoff, \n1972) for Love waves, and therefor are incapable of inverting for them. However, \ntheoretically these two software packages are useful up until the inversion process (i.e. \nextracting a dispersion image from a multichannel record and picking the fundamental \ndispersion curve). Once a dispersion curve has been picked from a Love wave dispersion \nimage, it can be inverted in an inversion algorithm that can be implemented in any \ncomputer language. The author has created a MATLAB\u00ae code which can invert Love \nwave fundamental mode dispersion curves as well as that of the Rayleigh wave for \nsimplified two-dimensional layered homogeneous isotropic models.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 3 \u2013 Area of Study \n \n\n \n36 \n\nChapter 3 - Area of Study \n \n\nIn the large scale, the area of study is situated on the Campos do Jord\u00e3o plateau, a high \nelevation land mass located near the southeastern border of the Mantiqueira mountain \nrange (Serra da Mantiqueira), Brazil.

The \nneighborhood has seen a sharp rise in the number of inhabitants and homes since the \n1970s (see Figure 3.2, right side) as the region has developed into a popular tourist \ndestination for Brazilians. Despite very expensive housing development in large parts of \nthe city, the population found in this neighborhood is predominantly low income and live \nin poor housing conditions, which is typically a result of initially unauthorized land use \nwhich was later legalized by the government. As a result, the steep terrain is improperly \noccupied, where cuts and landfills are often carried out by the residents themselves, often \nresulting in precarious and dangerous slope stability issues (Ahrendt, 2005).  \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 3 \u2013 Area of Study \n \n\n \n37 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 A recent satellite image of the city of Campos do Jord\u00e3o (left) from Google Earth, with the neighborhood \nof Santo Ant\u00f4nio circled in yellow and the site of investigation represented by a red square.

This survey was performed on the same survey line \nas illustrated in Figure 4.1. However, as the survey was only experimental and not a \nconventional refraction survey, it was only performed only with sources with three \ndifferent offsets on one side of the array. The source was a sledgehammer, which was \nused to hit against a metal plate that was wedged with its side into the earth to allow for a \nlateral force to generate SH waves. Shots were stacked 5 times to attenuate noise.  \n\nThree field surveys were performed for this research by the author and a crew from IAG \n\u2013 USP (surveys 2,3 &amp; 4 in Table 4.1). Surveys 2 and 3 are identical in all their \ncharacteristics with the exception of the geophone type and the date performed; survey 2 \nwas conducted in May of 2015 and survey 3 in June of 2015. One long array and three \nshort arrays were used for surveys 2 and 3 (see Figure 4.2).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 4 \u2013 Data Acquisition \n \n\n \n46 \n\nFigure 4.3 - Configuration of the circular array used for the passive-\nMASW survey. \n\nA \u201cfixed\u201d long array was used to maximize the depth of investigation while sacrificing \nany lateral variation, and a set of three \u201cmove-along\u201d short arrays were used to obtain \nhigher frequency data, by using shorter geophone spacing, and to introduce some lateral \nvariation by allowing for three 1-D inversion points at the mid-section of each short array. \nAlthough surveys 2 and 3 appear identical, by performing the same survey with \nhorizontally orientated geophones (oriented in the direction of the geophone line, or \nradially orientated) the radial component of the Rayleigh wave was recorded, despite the \nsource being a sledgehammer hitting a steel plate in the vertical direction. The \nmultichannel records of surveys 2 and 3 appear to show dispersion of surface wave \nenergy indicating the existence of Rayleigh waves at the site.  \n\nAnd lastly, a passive MASW survey was conducted approximately 150 meters south of \nthe site using a circular array (see Figure 3.4). This nearby location was selected because \nit was the nearest site that appeared to not have been disturbed by means of past human \nactivity, and because unlike the survey line location of all the other surveys, this location \nwas able to accommodate a 2-D geophone array. A passive MASW survey using a linear \narray at the main site of investigation was not performed due to the fact that some \nambient noise energy will arrive obliquely to the linear array and will appear with higher \n\u201capparent\u201d velocities than the real velocity of the noise (Louie, 2001). A circular array \nwas chosen as it equally records energy from all directions, providing higher resolutions \nfor ambient sources from all directions. The largest diameter that the site allowed for was \nused (15 m), as only the deeper layering is of interest at this location. Despite its distance \nfrom the original area of study some useful information can be obtained from this passive \nsurvey; in particular the deeper geological structure, which it is more likely to share with \nthe original survey line location.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 6 \u2013 Results and Conclusions \n \n\n \n47 \n\nChapter 5 \u2013 Data Processing and Analysis \n \n\n5.1 Refraction Data \n \n\nRayfract\u00ae recommends at least one shot per every sixth receiver in an array for a reliable \nWET tomography inversion. Although the survey used for P wave refraction analysis \ndoes not follow this recommendation, a considerable amount of shot locations were \nrecorded for considerable wave coverage. The SH refraction survey however was \nexperimental and has a very limited wave coverage.  \n\n \n\n5.1.1 SH Wave Refraction Data \n \n\nThe first arrival picks of SH refraction data can be seen in Appendix D.1. Unfortunately, \nas the survey was not intended for refraction tomography analysis there are only a limited \namount of source locations, only three in fact. As a result, there is a very limited amount \nof wave coverage (see Figure D.6 in Appendix D) and therefore the smoothed WET \ninversion results (Figure D.5 in Appendix D) are not very reliable. But nevertheless, it \nsuggests a shallow layer at around a meter in depth.    \n\n \n\n5.1.2 P Wave Refraction Data \n \n\nThe first arrival picks of P refraction data can be seen in Appendix D.2. It is clear from \nwave coverage graph (Figure D.10 of Appendix D) that there is much more wave \ncoverage in the P refraction survey as compared to the SH refraction survey. As a result \nthe smoothed WET inversion results (Figure D.9 of Appendix D) are considered to be \nmuch more reliable. The inversion results suggest again a layer interface at around a \nmeter in depth, another at 2 meters, and one more interface between six to twelve meters \nin depth. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 6 \u2013 Results and Conclusions \n \n\n \n48 \n\nFigure 5.1 - A dispersion image of Love wave energy obtained by processing through SurfSeis\u00a9. \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2 Love Wave Data \n \n\nA dispersion image is obtained from SurfSeis\u00a9 after processing the multichannel records \nof the SH refraction survey. It is evident from visual inspection that the 24 Hz geophones \ndid not record low enough frequencies to properly distinguish a fundamental mode Love \nwave. As a result, fundamental mode inversion was not performed. However a simple \ninspection of the dispersion image at higher frequencies reveals a minimum velocity of \n150 m/s, suggesting that the SH wave velocity of the surface layer is 150 m/s.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 6 \u2013 Results and Conclusions \n \n\n \n49 \n\nFigure 5.2 - Inversion of the passive MASW survey with circular array, 150 m south of the array line of the \narea of study.

This model is shown below in Figure 5.3.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCh. 6 \u2013 Results and Conclusions \n \n\n \n51 \n\n5.5 Active MASW  \n \n\nThe active source MASW analysis data can be viewed in Appendix E.  Section E.1.1 \nshows all the dispersion images associated with the short arrays used on the geophone \nline for the shallow survey. It is important to note that the combination of horizontal and \nvertical components aid in highlighting the fundamental mode at certain frequencies. In \nmany cases the fundamental mode was masked in the vertical component at certain \nfrequency ranges, and therefore by combining it with the horizontal (or radial) \ncomponent it reemerged. Likewise section E.2.1 shows the dispersion images for the long \narray for deeper investigation.  \n\nInversion results for the short arrays and long array are shown in E.1.2 and E.2.2, \nrespectively. For the short arrays in E.1.2, inversions are performed for the picked \ndispersion curves using default initial models in ParkSEIS\u00a9, and these inversions are \ninterpolated to create a pseudo two-dimensional inversion. Afterwards, an a-priori model \nis created and used as the initial model in SurfSeis\u00a9 for the same dispersion curves.  \nUnfortunately, this a-priori model caused an error in the inversion of the long array \ndispersion curve in E.2.2. This may have some relation with the rather unusual Poisson\u2019s \nratio and density values in the model. The best selected inversion of E.2.2 as well as the \ninversion of its redefined dispersion curve appear to suggest an interface (perhaps of \nresidual soil and saprolite) at around 5 m, followed by gradual increases in velocity until \n25 m, where bedrock is not found as the low-frequency data is not available.  \n\nAn extra low-frequency point is then selected for the best selected inversion of E.2.2 to \nbetter define the inversion at low frequencies (Figure E.13). A reasonable shear wave \nvelocity profile is inverted in SurfSeis\u00a9 (using the default initial model) to obtain Figure \nE.14. The author believes this inversion to be the most representative 1-D shear wave \nvelocity profile of the site of investigation. This is due to the fact that it agrees well with \nrefraction and other surface wave results, as well as the interfaces defined by geological \nand geotechnical data. In order to further investigate the validity of this inversion, a \ncomparison between synthetic and real data is shown in section E.2.3. \n\nThe synthetic data is obtained using the modeling module in ParkSEIS\u00a9, which is based \non the reflectivity method by Fuchs and M\u00fcller, 1971. The code itself is based on a DOS \nexecutable created by Dr. Adam O\u2019Neill at Kyoto University, which is based on codes \nprovided by Dr. Klaus Holliger at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Dr. \nMichael Roth at NORSAR. The inputted model (inverted model from Figure E.14) is \nshown in Figure E.15, and the resulting side-by-side comparisons of synthetic and field \nseismograms and dispersion images are shown in Figures E.16-20. \n\n\n\nCh. 6 \u2013 Results and Conclusions \n \n\n \n52 \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Results and Conclusions \n \n\n6.1 Limitations and Shortcomings  \n \n\nThere are some serious limitations to the inversion of perceived fundamental mode \nRayleigh wave energy through MASW analysis, using inversion based on simplified two-\ndimensional forward modeling approaches, which assume flat layering and homogenous \nand isotropic behavior in each layer. These limitations include but are not limited to: \n\n? Human error involved in dispersion curve picking \n? Human error in the field during field measurements \n? Non-uniqueness of fundamental mode dispersion curve inversion \n? Violations of perfectly layered homogeneous isotropic media  \n? The abundance of local minima in the inversion solution space \n? Lack of lateral resolution \n\nTo test inversion reliability, two models where tested using the author\u2019s MATLAB\u00ae \ncode, which utilizes the objective function described in Eq. 2.14 and the fminsearch \nalgorithm in the inversion processes based on the fundamental mode dispersion curve. \nThese models and the inversion results are shown in Appendix C. Model 1 is a simplified \ntwo-layer model, and Model 2 is a 6-layer model from Xia et al., 1999. The inversion of \nModel 1 is shown in Figure C.3, with only a single initial model, which has similar \nproperty profiles, but has a dispersion curve that is quite far from Model 1\u2019s. The right \nhand side of Figure C.3 shows how the simple fminsearch based inversion scheme finds a \ngood fit in terms of the dispersion curve, ??, and ??, but is unable to find a good match \nfor density. Inverting Model 2 on the other hand is much more complicated. Figure C.6 \nshows the inversion results of Model 2 and how they differ with 9 different initial models, \nwhich only differ in the value of ?? (by modifying the Poisson\u2019s ratio), and depth to the \nhalf-space. The results highlights the abundance of local minima of the objective function \n(Eq. 2.14), and how important initial models are in the inversion process. To have the \nbest initial model it is imperative to have as much knowledge of the parameters as \npossible. The sensitivity analysis in Figure C.7 reveals that the thicknesses of each layer \ninfluences the dispersion curve the greatest, followed by ??, with little contribution from \n??, and practically no influence from density.   \n\n \n\n6.2 Areas of Future Improvement \n \n\nMASW and surface wave analysis in general are currently very active research topics \n(Socco et al, 2010). A promising new research includes a new method called \u201cPolar \nMute\u201d, which mutes higher mode energy in the dispersion image by separating prograde \nand retrograde motion (Gribler, 2015). It is conceivable that more muting techniques will \n\n\n\nCh. 6 \u2013 Results and Conclusions \n \n\n \n53 \n\nfurther help in isolating the energy of different modes in the dispersion image. However, \nan altogether different approach is the inversion of the dispersion image itself. Dal Moro \nhas dubbed this \u201cFull Velocity Spectrum Inversion\u201d (Moro, 2015). This approach \neliminates the human error involved in picking the fundamental mode dispersion curve \nfrom the dispersion image, or \u201cFull Velocity Spectrum\u201d. Another approach is the \ninversion of the \u201ceffective dispersion curve\u201d (Moro, 2015). The effective dispersion \ncurve is essentially the curve, which follows the pattern of highest energy on the \ndispersion image. Tokimatsu et al., 1992 provides the relationships between the effective \ndispersion curve and the modal dispersion curves. The most computationally intensive \ninversion method is full waveform inversion. However, this method and is rarely used for \nnear surface applications. Perhaps the most complete inversion possible would be a full \nwaveform inversion assuming a viscoelastic-anisotropic-inhomogeneous medium, but \ncomputer technology has not reached the level to where this would be practicable for \nmost applications.  \n\n \n\n6.3 Final Conclusions \n \n\nIt is the author\u2019s opinion that the biggest drawback to the MASW method (as defined in \nthis research) is the relatively long array length (and therefore lack of lateral resolution) \nrequired to obtain higher resolution dispersion images and the uncertainty in picking the \ndispersion curve. Ultimately, a series of picked points on the perceived fundamental \nmode dispersion curve from phase-shifted seismic data does not necessarily invert into \nreliable results. However crude this method may appear, it can be quite powerful and \neffective when combining data from both horizontal and vertical components, \nimplementing various filtering tools, and knowing some a-priori information (particularly \nat depths, which correspond to the most sensitive frequencies of the dispersion curve). \n\nIt appears that the MASW results in this research have not only confirmed the refraction \nWET tomography inversion results, but also inverted realistic deeper shear wave velocity \nprofiles (though unfortunately not reaching the bedrock). Ultimately, the maximum \ninvertible depth at the site of investigation is limited to the length of the array, which was \nlimited by the site constraints of the site of investigation. Although this method still has \nsome way to improve, it is without question a valuable tool to increase the amount of \nsubsurface information from a conventional refraction or linear array seismic survey.    \n\nWith respect to implications of the results to land slide risk, one can see a consistent near \nsurface layer interface from virtually all sources (geotechnical, refraction, and surface \nwave) at around one meter in depth. This is characterized as the interface between the \ntop-soil layer and the residual soil. This interface depth appears to be consistent with the \nslip surfaces reported by Ahrendt (2005), and therefore is potentially related to the slip \nsurface depths of the landslides that occurred in Campos do Jord\u00e3o the winter of \n1999/2000. However, the depth to bedrock was not obtainable due to the limited array \nlength, and the water level was not found due to the limited depth of the P wave WET \ntomography inversion results. \n\n\n\nReferences \n \n\n \n54 \n\nReferences \n \n\nAhrendt, A., 2005.

However, this statement is only valid \nfor small-strain waves. Large-strain waves may be generated in the near field of sources \nand in the near surface during earthquakes (Santamarina, 2001). As a result, the following \nequations are not valid in the near-field of a source and for very large \u201cearthquake\u201d \nmagnitude sources. However, for small strains the soil behaves essentially as a linear \nmedium (Foti, 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure A.1 - Stress-strain curves under elastic, elastic-plastic, plastic, and viscoelastic regimes.

Forward modeling surface wave dispersion requires solving the \nwave equation, an often very difficult task. The most common approaches involved using \nthe transfer matrix method, introduced by Thomson (1950) and Haskel (1953).  \n\nThe following is a compact code written in the MATLAB\u00ae language that utilizes the \nRayleigh wave dispersion algorithm provided by De Lucena (2014). This function inputs \nangular frequency, Rayleigh wave phase velocity, and the parameters of a layered model \n(i.e. ??,??,?,? for each layer). The output of the function varies with frequency and \nphase velocity, but when it reaches zero (i.e. a root) the inputs represent a point on a \ndispersion curve. Another algorithm (not provided in this report) was developed to find \nall the roots of this function to eventually plot the dispersion curves.  \n\n \n\nfunction H=dunkin(param,c,w)     %c = Phase velocity, w = Angular frequency \nn = length(param)/4;
