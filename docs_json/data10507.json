The\nspecies exhibits a relatively long reproductive period, a relative fecundity of 0.173 oocytes per mg of female total weight, and\nfractional spawning. The sex ratio did not differ from 1:1 during all sampled months. Sexual dimorphism related to hypertrophy\nof the male\u2019s distal portion of caudal filament was observed and males grew to greater lengths than females. Male gonadosomatic\nindex (GSI) was significantly related to water depth, oxygen saturation and temperature.

Representatives of this order can\nbe found in several aquatic habitats, including river channels,\nfloodplains, flooded forests, forest streams, waterfalls,\nswamps, coastal creeks and estuarine reaches (Crampton &amp;\nAlbert, 2006). The family Hypopomidae is known from the\ncontinental waters of all South American countries except Chile,\nranging from r\u00edo de La Plata in Argentina to rio Tuira in Panama\n(Albert, 2001). The genus Brachyhypopomus is the most widely\ndistributed among the hypopomids, reaching the same\ngeographic limits as the family (Albert &amp; Crampton, 2003).\n\nReproduction represents one of the most important\naspects of the biology of a species, the maintenance of viable\npopulations depending on its success (Suzuki &amp; Agostinho,\n1997). Although studies on the reproductive cycle of fishes\nhave been extensively conducted world-wide, Neotropical\nregion has received much less attention (Barbieri &amp; Barbieri,\n1985). For gymnotiform species, few data concerning\nreproductive aspects are available (Kirschbaum, 1979; Barbieri\n&amp; Barbieri, 1982, 1983a, 1983b, 1984a, 1984b, 1985; Hagedorn,\n1988; Assun\u00e7\u00e3o &amp; Schwassmann, 1995; Kirschbaum &amp;\nSchugardt, 2002; Silva et al., 2003; Quintana et al., 2004). In\nsouthern Brazil, studies on the reproductive biology of\ngymnotiform species have been undertaken by Cognato &amp;\nFialho (2006) on Gymnotus aff. carapo, by Giora &amp; Fialho\n(2009) concerning Eigenmannia trilineata, and by Giora (2008)\n\n\n\nReproductive biology of Brachyhypopomus draco738\n\nconcerning two Brachyhypopomus species, all in the\nprotected area of Parque Estadual de Itapu\u00e3.\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the reproductive\nbiology of a population of Brachyhypopomus draco, recently\ndescribed by Giora et al. (2008), from southern Brazil by\ndetermining the reproductive period and its relations with\nenvironmental and feeding factors, and to determine the\nabsolute and relative fecundities, spawning type, sex ratio\nand sexual dimorphism of the species.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nThe specimens of Brachyhypopomus draco were sampled\nmonthly from September 2003 to August 2004 in lagoa Verde,\nin the Parque Estadual de Itapu\u00e3 (Rio Grande do Sul State),\nwhich is situated in the laguna dos Patos system. Lagoa Verde\n(30\u00b022\u201952\u2019\u2019S 51\u00b001\u201925\u2019\u2019W) has an area of approximately 4 ha\nand a maximum depth of 1 m. The site shows a predominantly\nmuddy substratum, great amount of floating plants and plant\nmaterial in decomposition.\n\nFishes were sampled using a dip net under floating\nvegetation and an electric fish finder (Crampton et al., 2007).\nThe specimens were fixed in the field in 10% formalin solution.\nWater temperature, depth, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen\nwere recorded at the time and place of collection. Rainfall\ndata were obtained from the Meteorology District of Porto\nAlegre and photoperiod was obtained with the SkyMap Pro\n9.0 software , by correlating dates of collection with collecting\nplace coordinates.\n\nIn the laboratory, fishes were preserved in 70% ethanol.\nTotal length (Lt) in millimeters and total weight (Wt) in grams\nwere measured, and the specimens were dissected to record\nliver (Wl), stomach (Ws) and gonad (Wg) weight. Voucher\nspecimens are deposited in the fish collection of the\nDepartamento de Zoologia, Universidade Federal do Rio\nGrande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil (UFRGS 5719 and UFRGS\n6635).\n\nStomach repletion index (RI), hepatosomatic index (HSI)\nand gonadosomatic index (GSI) were estimated following the\nformula adapted from Santos (1978). These indexes represent\nthe proportion of organ weight to total individual weight: RI\n= 100 x Ws / Wt; HSI = 100 x Wl / Wt; and GSI = 100 x Wg /\nWt. Ws corresponds to stomach weight, Wl to liver weight,\nWg to gonadal weight and Wt to total weight.\n\nThe reproductive period for males and females was\nestablished through the analysis of monthly variation of mean\nGSI values. A multiple regression with analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) (Zar, 1999) was applied to investigate relations\nbetween abiotic factors (rainfall, photoperiod, temperature,\nconductivity, depth, and oxygen saturation) and GSI, as well\nas between feeding factors (RI and HSI) and GSI. To avoid\ntendentious results in the multiple regression analysis, a test\nof correlation was applied to the abiotic and feeding factors\ntested, which showed no correlation between them.\n\nAbsolute fecundity was estimated by counting all\nvitellogenic oocytes present in the ovaries of 10 females with\n\nthe highest GSI values. The relative fecundity was determined\nby the number of vitellogenic oocytes counted per female\nmilligram of total weight (Adebisi, 1987). For the determination\nof the spawning type, the same gonads selected for fecundity\nanalysis were used. A sub-sample of 150 oocytes was removed\nfrom each selected gonad and the largest possible oocyte\ndiameter was obtained by examination under a stereomicroscope\nequipped with an ocular micrometer (Vazzoler, 1996).\n\nThe sex ratio was determined by the distribution of male\nand female frequency during the sample period. The c2 test\n(with a confidence limit of p &lt;0.01) was applied to determine\nthe existence of significant differences between the number\nof males and females. The distribution of relative frequencies\nof males and females in different total length classes was\nanalyzed to observe sexual dimorphism related to total length.\n\nThe distal portion of the caudal filament of some males\nwas vertically broadened and laterally compressed. To\ndetermine a possible relation between this sexually dimorphic\nfeature and the established reproductive period, the greatest\ndepth found in the last 15 mm of the filament was measured,\nand its percentage in relation to the total length was calculated\nin every male sampled. These values were grouped in\nmodification classes (level one, from 0 to 1.5%; level two,\nfrom 1.51% to 2.5%; level three, from 2.51% to 3.5%) and their\nrelative frequencies were analyzed monthly by a ?2 test (with\na confidence limit of p &lt;0.05). Individuals with indications of\npredation or regeneration were excluded from this analysis.\n\nResults\n\nA total of 300 specimens - 150 females with total length\nranging from 55.5 to 176.8 mm and 150 males ranging from\n68.2 to 212.3 mm - were analyzed. The estimated reproductive\nperiod lasted from August to December for females and from\nJuly to December for males (Fig. 1).\n\nThe GSI of B. draco males did not exhibit a significant\nrelation with the feeding indexes analyzed (IR and HSI),\nwhereas the GSI of females showed significant positive\nrelation with HSI (Table 1). Among the six abiotic factors that\nwere considered, temperature, oxygen saturation, and water\ndepth positively influenced male GSI, while female GSI was\naffected only by water depth (Table 1). Monthly data of RI\nand HSI variation are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively.\nMonthly data of water temperature, conductivity, depth,\ndissolved oxygen, rainfall, and photoperiod for the study site\nare summarized in Fig. 4.\n\nThe absolute fecundity of the species analyzed showed\nan average value of 935.8 vitellogenic oocytes (ranging from\n576 to 1391 oocytes) for females with total length from 113.9\nto 174 mm (Table 2). The average relative fecundity was\nestimated as 0.17 vitellogenic oocytes per mg total weight\n(Table 2). Analysis of the absolute frequency distribution of\noocyte diameter conforms to that of a species with\nsynchronous oocyte development in more than two groups,\nand with fractional spawning, the species being estimated to\nspawn at least twice during a reproductive period (Fig. 5).

These are the smallest germinative cells that are\nvisible under a stereomicroscope, have a large and central\nnucleus, and contain no yolk vesicles. The reserve oocytes\nwill only mature in the next reproductive period, but are\nfollowed by oocyte stores in successive maturation stages\n(Fig. 5), which are released at different times in the current\nreproductive period. The presence of reserve oocytes and more\nthan one store of oocytes in successive developmental stages\nprovide evidence that B. draco is an iteroparous species.\n\nThe sex ratio established for the B. draco studied population\nwas 1:1 in each month, as well as in the global sample. Sexual\ndimorphism related to total body length was determined for the\nspecies, with males growing to greater lengths than females\n(Fig. 6). The largest male and female sampled had total lengths\nof 212.3 mm and 176.8 mm, respectively. Males of B. draco with\nhypertrophy of the distal portion of caudal filament - vertical\nbroadening and lateral compression, which give the caudal\nfilament a paddle-like shape - were sampled during all months\nof the year, with male caudal filament depth ranging from 0.96\nto 6.88 mm, representing 1.14% to 3.47% of total length. Caudal\nfilaments grouped in level one (n = 32) were found in all months\nof the year, except November and December, but with higher\nfrequency in April and July (Fig. 7). Caudal filaments in level\ntwo (n = 94) were found in all sampled months, showing a\nhigher frequency in November (Fig. 7). Filaments in level three\n(n = 7) were found from August to January except in September\nand November (Fig. 7). The ?2 test indicated a significant\ndifference between the three levels during the whole sampled\nyear, except in February and July, with the highest values\noccurring from August to December and in March (Table 3).\nNo individuals with level three filaments were found from\nFebruary to July of the year studied, suggesting a regression\nof the caudal filament hypertrophy after the reproductive\nperiod months (Fig. 7).\n\n\n\nReproductive biology of Brachyhypopomus draco740\n\nFig. 3.

Fish species need particular environmental\nconditions during the reproductive period to guarantee the\ngrowth and survival of new generation individuals (Vazzoler,\n1996). Brachyhypopomus draco has a seasonal reproductive\nperiod occurring from August to December for females and\nfrom July to December for males, periods that corresponds to\nthe middle of winter till the end of spring in the subtropical\nsouthern hemisphere.\n\nThe reproductive cycles of gymnotiform species from the\ntropical area of the Neotropical region have been related to\nenvironmental aspects involved in the changes between\nrainy and dry seasons, where breeding occurs when the\nincrease in rainfall determines high water levels and low\nwater conductivities (Hopkins, 1974a, 1974b; Kirschbaum,\n1975, 1979, 1984, 2000; Schwassmann, 1976; Hagedorn, 1988;\nKirschbaum &amp; Schugardt, 2002). On the other hand, studies\nwith gymnotiform species, in regions close to the southern\nboundary of their continental distribution, show the relation\nof reproductive periods with the increase in temperature\n\n\n\nA.

For the B. draco population from\nlagoa Verde, the male reproductive cycle showed a positive\nrelation with temperature, but no relation was found for\nphotoperiod.\n\nFor the B. draco population studied, male and female\nreproductive periods were related to water depth, male\nreproductive period being also related to oxygen saturation.\nThese mentioned abiotic factors are linked to environmental\nchanges caused by rainfall suggesting that breeding occurs\nduring the rainiest period of the year. However, the rainfall\ndata obtained for the study area did not show a statistically\nsignificant relation with male and female reproductive periods.\nStudies at Parque Estadual de Itapu\u00e3 concerning gymnotiform\nspecies have established reproductive periods occurring from\nOctober to February for Eigenmannia trilineata (Giora &amp;\nFialho, 2009) and from November to March for Gymnotus aff.\ncarapo (Cognato &amp; Fialho, 2006). With this mind, the low\nrainfall rates and water depth observed during the months of\n\n\n\nReproductive biology of Brachyhypopomus draco742\n\nJanuary through April of the year studied might have induced\nthe regression of male and female gonads and might have\ndetermined the anticipation of the end of the B. draco\npopulation breeding season.\n\nThe number of reproductive episodes before death is a\nkey life-history character, and biologists have long considered\nthe distinctions between life histories with a single\nreproductive episode (semelparity) and those with multiple\nepisodes (iteroparity) to be particularly important (Young,\n1981). The B. draco population studied showed an iteroparous\nlife-history strategy, agreeing with the results that have been\nobtained for other species of Gymnotiformes (Barbieri &amp;\nBarbieri, 1982; Assun\u00e7\u00e3o &amp; Schwassmann, 1995; Kirschbaum\n&amp; Schugardt, 2002; Quintana et al., 2004; Cognato &amp; Fialho,\n2006; Giora &amp; Fialho, 2009; Giora, 2008).\n\nIteroparous species of fishes frequently show a negative\nrelation between female HSI and GSI due to the allocation of\nenergy from the liver to the oocytes that are being produced\n(Jobling, 1995). However, for B. draco females a positive\nrelation between these indexes has been established. Marked\ndifferences in fecundity between species often reflect\ndifferent reproductive strategies; within a given species,\nfecundity can vary as a result of different adaptation to\nenvironmental habitats (Wooton, 1984). The absolute and\nrelative fecundities established for B. draco are slightly lower\nthan those determined for the species Brachyhypopomus\nbombilla and Brachyhypopomus gauderio (Giora, 2008),\nwhich were found to be 587.33 oocytes and 0.21 oocytes per\nmg of total weight, and 589.44 oocytes and 0.20 oocytes per\nmg of total weight, respectively. Two other studies with\nGymnotiformes from southern Brazil have shown slightly\nhigher relative fecundities for the species, these being 0.20\noocytes per mg of total weight for Gymnotus aff. carapo\n(Cognato &amp; Fialho, 2006) and 0.27 for E. trilineata (Giora &amp;\nFialho, 2009). According to Vazzoler (1996), fecundity depends,\nas a last resort, on the coelomatic cavity capacity of lodge\nripe oocytes and of oocyte size. As a consequence of the\npeculiar anatomy of gymnotiform fishes, which results in a\nshort coelomatic cavity that cannot lodge a great number of\noocytes, a lower relative fecundity is expected in comparison\nwith Characiformes and Siluriformes species (Cognato &amp;\nFialho, 2006). Notwithstanding, more studies concerning\nrelative fecundity data are needed for a better comparison\namong species of Gymnotiformes and between these and non-\ngymnotiform fishes.\n\nConsidering that fecundity depends on fish total length,\nfractional spawning represents a procedure through which\nspecies can increase the number of oocytes produced during\none reproductive season to a much higher number than that\npredicted considering their size (Vazzoler, 1996). The\ngymnotiform short coelomatic cavity and relatively low\nfecundity can be the determinants for the establishment of a\nfractional spawning reproductive strategy by these fishes,\nas a way of increasing the amount of oocytes released\nthroughout the reproductive period. Fractional spawning has\nalso been reported as the strategy adopted by all gymnotiform\n\nspecies studied up until now (Barbieri &amp; Barbieri, 1982;\nAssun\u00e7\u00e3o &amp; Schwassmann, 1995; Kirschbaum &amp; Schugardt,\n2002; Quintana et al., 2004; Cognato &amp; Fialho, 2006; Giora &amp;\nFialho, 2009; Giora, 2008).\n\nSexual dimorphism is a common phenomenon, and there\nis a great variety of ecological reasons for its origin and\nmaintenance, such as sexual selection and differentiation of\nreproductive roles (Cox-Fernandes, 1998). Brachyhypopomus\ndraco showed sexual dimorphism related to fish total length -\nwith males growing to greater lengths than females - as well\nas being related to morphology of the caudal filament, which\ncarries the electric organ. Comparing the monthly variation of\nmale GSI and the frequency distribution of caudal filament\ndepth levels, it is possible to conclude that mature males\nundergo hypertrophy of the distal portion of caudal filament\nduring the reproductive period, after which this structure\nregresses until the caudal filament resembles that of females\nand juveniles. This was also corroborated by the ?2  statistical\ntest, with modification levels appearing to be significantly\ndifferent during almost all the year sampled, especially in the\nreproductive period, showing no significant differences\nduring the month before and after the reproductive period\nestablished, when fishes are probably going through the major\nmodifications of the caudal filament. Modifications in the\nmature male caudal filament, e.g., broadening, compression,\nand/or elongation, have been frequently reported for\nBrachyhypopomus species (Hagedorn &amp; Carr, 1985;\nHagedorn, 1988; Hopkins et al., 1990; Rapp-Py-Daniel &amp; Cox-\nFernandes, 2005; Giora, 2008). According to Hopkins (1999),\nfor pulse fishes such as Brachyhypopomus, the energy\nexpenditure of electric sign increases with the power and\nduration of a single EOD generated. Besides that, the same\nauthor stated that males that generate longer-duration EODs\nsuffer a drop in the peak amplitude of the discharge,\ncompensating for this drop by growing their tails longer and\nthicker, so that they can generate greater voltage and current.\nWith this mind, females would choose males for mating on\nthe basis of EODs that have demanding more energy for males\nto produce, favoring the males with hypertrophy of the distal\nportion of caudal filament.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Diego de Paula Cognato for the\ncollection of the specimens and to Conselho Nacional de\nDesenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico - CNPq.
