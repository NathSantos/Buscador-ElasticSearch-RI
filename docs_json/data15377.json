Bacterial pathogenicity depends greatly on the \n\nability to secrete virulence factors to or beyond the bacterial cell surface. Thus, the study of \n\nsecreted proteins is of crucial importance to further develop defensive strategies.  \n\nThe Tat pathway, one of the secretion systems present in L. monocytogenes, was until now \n\nonly investigated in silico. Therefore, a better understanding of the Tat pathway was needed. \n\nIn L. monocytogenes, strain EGDe, two proteins constitute the Tat pathway and are encoded \n\nin the genes tatC (lmo0361) and tatA (lmo0362).  \n\nIn the present study, a L. monocytogenes mutant strain lacking the genes coding for the Tat \n\npathway was successfully constructed (EGDe ?tatAC). The mutant showed the ability to \n\ngrow at the same growth rate as the parent strain, proving that the Tat pathway is not \n\nessential for L. monocytogenes survival. Moreover this study showed that both genes are \n\ntranscribed in a bicistronic and growth-phase dependent manner. \n\nThe deletion mutant for the Tat pathway showed no differences in the in vitro virulence \n\npotential, but significant differences (p &lt;0.05) were found when in vivo virulence potential \n\nwas assessed, being the tat mutant more virulent than the wild-type strain.  \n\nRegulation of tatAC was also investigated, and a deletion mutant for lmo0364, a gene coding \n\nfor a transcription regulator, localized close to the tat genes, was constructed. Our results \n\nshow that Lmo0364 is not related to the other genes in the locus, as it is not involved in the \n\ntranscription regulation of any of the genes analyzed. \n\nThis is, to our knowledge, the first experimental study on the Tat pathway of L. \n\nmonocytogenes. Here we show that this pathway is not essential for the bacterium and that it \n\nmight be impairing its virulence ability. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords:  \n\nListeria monocytogenes; secretion system; Tat pathway; deletion mutant. \n\n  \n\n\n\niv \n \n\nResumo \n\nListeria monocytogenes \u00e9 actualmente considerada uma bact\u00e9ria patog\u00e9nica de risco para a \n\nInd\u00fastria Alimentar, afectando essencialmente gr\u00e1vidas, crian\u00e7as, idosos e indiv\u00edduos \n\nimunocomprometidos. Este risco torna-se cada vez mais importante, \u00e0 medida que \n\naumentam os casos de doentes imunocomprometidos, quer por infec\u00e7\u00f5es por VIH ou por \n\ntratamentos como quimioterapia e radioterapia, entre outros. \n\nL. monocytogenes \u00e9 uma bact\u00e9ria gram-positiva em forma de bastonete com dimens\u00f5es de \n\n0,4 \u00b5m por 1 a 1,5 \u00b5m. Esta bact\u00e9ria caracteriza-se pelo seu baixo teor em G+C, por ser \n\nanaer\u00f3bia facultativa, catalase positiva e oxidase negativa. A sua principal caracter\u00edstica \u00e9 a \n\nsua versatilidade no que diz respeito \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es de crescimento, nomeadamente, \n\ntemperatura (1 a 45 ?C), pH (4,4 a 9,6), cloreto de s\u00f3dio (10 a 20% (m/v)), sais biliares (10 a \n\n40% (m/v)), actividade da \u00e1gua (aw) (?0,92) e a toler\u00e2ncia a alguns metais, geralmente \n\nt\u00f3xicos para outras bact\u00e9rias, como o l\u00edtio, o t\u00e1lio e o tel\u00fario. \n\nListeriose \u00e9 o nome dado \u00e0 doen\u00e7a provocada por L. monocytogenes e encontra-se \n\nassociada uma elevada taxa de mortalidade (20 a 30%). Na Europa, o n\u00famero de casos \n\nconfirmados aumentou 19% em 2009, comparativamente com 2008. L. monocytogenes \u00e9 \n\num parasita intracelular facultativo. Ap\u00f3s ingest\u00e3o de alimentos contaminados, a bact\u00e9ria \n\ntem a capacidade de atravessar o epit\u00e9lio intestinal e disseminar-se atrav\u00e9s dos vasos \n\nlinf\u00e1ticos ou sangu\u00edneos, para tecidos mais profundos. O f\u00edgado e o ba\u00e7o s\u00e3o \u00f3rg\u00e3os-alvo \n\nprim\u00e1rios para a sucessiva multiplica\u00e7\u00e3o bacteriana, com a poss\u00edvel forma\u00e7\u00e3o de abcessos. \n\nUma das principais caracter\u00edsticas fisiopatol\u00f3gicas de L. monocytogenes \u00e9 a capacidade de \n\natravessar barreiras epiteliais, como a barreira hemato-encef\u00e1lica e a barreira placent\u00e1ria, \n\nlevando a meningo-encefalite ou infec\u00e7\u00e3o do feto, podendo eventualmente causar aborto e \n\nmorte ou meningite neonatal. \n\nA patogenicidade bacteriana encontra-se bastante dependente da capacidade das bact\u00e9rias \n\nsegregarem factores de virul\u00eancia, que s\u00e3o expostos \u00e0 superf\u00edcie da c\u00e9lula, segregados \n\npara o ambiente extracelular ou, at\u00e9 mesmo, injectados directamente nas c\u00e9lulas \n\nhospedeiras. Enquanto que em bact\u00e9rias gram-negativas, para que haja secre\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nprote\u00ednas para o exterior da c\u00e9lula t\u00eam de ser transpostas duas membranas biol\u00f3gicas, em \n\nbact\u00e9rias gram-positivas, os mecanismos de transposi\u00e7\u00e3o da membrana citoplasm\u00e1tica \n\npermitem a segrega\u00e7\u00e3o eficaz de prote\u00ednas para o exterior da c\u00e9lula. \n\nEm bact\u00e9rias gram-positivas, s\u00e3o, actualmente, reconhecidos sete sistemas de secre\u00e7\u00e3o: \n\nSec (Secretion), Tat (Twin-arginine translocation), FPE (Fimbrilin \u2013 Protein Exporter), \n\ntransportadores ABC (ATP-binding cassette), FEA (Flagella Export Apparatus), Holinas e \n\nSistema Wss. \n\n\n\nv \n \n\nRelativamente a L. monocytogenes, embora a secre\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00ednas seja de extrema \n\nimport\u00e2ncia, quer no processo de coloniza\u00e7\u00e3o de ambientes bi\u00f3ticos e abi\u00f3ticos, quer na \n\nsua virul\u00eancia, ainda muito pouco \u00e9 conhecido. Assim, a partir dos genomas sequenciados e \n\ncom recurso \u00e0 bioinform\u00e1tica, foram indentificados, em L. monocytogenes, todos os \n\nsistemas descritos para gram-positivos. \n\nO sistema Tat \u00e9 respons\u00e1vel pela secre\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00ednas na sua conforma\u00e7\u00e3o final, tendo as \n\nprote\u00ednas secretadas por este sistema um motivo N-terminal [(S/T)TRRXFLK] de consenso. \n\nEste sistema de secre\u00e7\u00e3o foi primeiramente identificado em bact\u00e9rias gram-negativas, \n\nsendo essencial para a sua funcionalidade tr\u00eas prote\u00ednas membranares: TatA, TatB e TatC. \n\nA maioria das bact\u00e9rias gram-positivas possui um sistema Tat \u201cminimalista\u201d pois apenas as \n\nprote\u00ednas TatA e TatC est\u00e3o presentes, sendo TatA bifuncional, colmatando a inexist\u00eancia \n\nde TatB. \n\nEste sistema de secre\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 presente em v\u00e1rios microrganismos patog\u00e9nicos, para os \n\nquais foi demonstrada a sua import\u00e2ncia para os estilos de vida, sapr\u00f3fito ou patog\u00e9nico. A \n\nsecre\u00e7\u00e3o de prote\u00ednas por este sistema demonstrou ser importante para a mobilidade em \n\nEscherichia coli O157:H7, para a infec\u00e7\u00e3o e para a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de ferro em Pseudomonas \n\naeruginosa, para o crescimento, divis\u00e3o e forma\u00e7\u00e3o de biofilme em Legionella pneumophila \n\ne para a capacidade infecciosa in vivo de Staphylococcus aureus. \n\nEm L. monocytogenes apenas uma c\u00f3pia dos genes tatA e tatC foi identificada, sendo que a \n\nprote\u00edna considerada como secretada por este sistema se encontra codificada num oper\u00e3o \n\nmuito pr\u00f3ximo deste locus. \n\nO trabalho que aqui se apresenta teve como objectivo o estudo do sistema Tat em L. \n\nmonocytogenes. \n\nPara avaliar o papel deste sistema de secre\u00e7\u00e3o, construiu-se um mutante de delec\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nestirpe EGDe nos genes codificantes para o sistema Tat. O mutante foi constru\u00eddo usando \n\num sistema de dois passos: um primeiro passo de integra\u00e7\u00e3o e segundo passo de \n\ndesintegra\u00e7\u00e3o do plasm\u00eddeo no genoma, atrav\u00e9s de regi\u00f5es hom\u00f3logas \u00e0s regi\u00f5es anterior e \n\nposterior aos genes. Tanto quanto se sabe, trata-se do primeiro mutante de delec\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndescrito para o sistema Tat em L. monocytogenes. O sistema Tat n\u00e3o se mostrou essencial \n\nao crescimento de L. monocytogenes em meio completo e em meio m\u00ednimo, apresentando o \n\nmutante e a estirpe selvagem taxas espec\u00edficas de crescimento semelhantes. \n\nForam efectuados estudos transcriptionais relativos ao locus do sistema, nomeadamente \n\nan\u00e1lises Northern blot e estudos da actividade promotora, fazendo uso do gene codificante \n\npara a ?-galactosidase, como gene rep\u00f3rter. A transcri\u00e7\u00e3o dos genes tatA e tatC revelou-se \n\ndependente da fase de crescimento, sendo a transcri\u00e7\u00e3o mais evidente na fase exponencial, \n\n\n\nvi \n \n\ncomparativamente com a fase estacion\u00e1ria. Demonstrou-se ainda que a transcri\u00e7\u00e3o dos \n\ngenes codificantes para o sistema Tat \u00e9 bicistr\u00f3nica, apresentando o oper\u00e3o correspondente \n\numa forte actividade promotora.  \n\nA exist\u00eancia de um regulador de transcri\u00e7\u00e3o (Lmo0364) codificado no locus estudado, levou \n\n\u00e0 hip\u00f3tese de este se encontrar relacionado com a regula\u00e7\u00e3o da transcri\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema Tat. \n\nEsta hip\u00f3tese foi investigada atrav\u00e9s da constru\u00e7\u00e3o de um mutante de delec\u00e7\u00e3o neste \n\nregulador de transcri\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto, n\u00e3o foram registadas altera\u00e7\u00f5es, quer na transcri\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nquer na actividade promotora dos genes estudados. \n\nEstudos pr\u00e9vios realizados in silico, por outros autores, identificaram apenas uma prote\u00edna \n\nsecretada atrav\u00e9s deste sistema. Esta prote\u00edna est\u00e1 codificada no oper\u00e3o lmo0365-67, \n\nsendo a \u00faltima do oper\u00e3o (lmo0367). De forma a identificar esta e/ou outras prote\u00ednas \n\nsecretadas por este sistema, procedeu-se a uma an\u00e1lise das prote\u00ednas secretadas por SDS-\n\nPAGE, n\u00e3o tendo sido no entanto poss\u00edvel detectar altera\u00e7\u00f5es entre o secretoma do \n\nmutante e o secretoma da estirpe selvagem, possivelmente devido \u00e0s limita\u00e7\u00f5es desta \n\nmetodologia (limites de resolu\u00e7\u00e3o e detec\u00e7\u00e3o). \n\nOs potenciais de virul\u00eancia dos dois mutantes (EGDe ?tatAC e EGDe ?lmo0364) foram \n\ntamb\u00e9m avaliados in vitro, atrav\u00e9s da infec\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e9lulas epiteliais humanas, e in vivo, \n\natrav\u00e9s da contagem de bact\u00e9rias no ba\u00e7o, ap\u00f3s tr\u00eas dias de inocula\u00e7\u00e3o subcut\u00e2nea em \n\nratinhos. Apesar de n\u00e3o terem sido identificadas diferen\u00e7as no potencial virulento in vitro, \n\nforam verificadas diferen\u00e7as significativas (p &lt;0,05) in vivo, sendo que o mutante tatAC \n\ndemonstrou um potencial virulento mais elevado do que a estirpe selvagem, demonstrando \n\nque a presen\u00e7a deste sistema de secre\u00e7\u00e3o nesta estirpe poder\u00e1 dificultar o processo de \n\ninfec\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nAo contr\u00e1rio do que se verificou noutros microrganismos patog\u00e9nicos, o sistema Tat n\u00e3o \u00e9 \n\nnecess\u00e1rio \u00e0 sobreviv\u00eancia de L. monocytogenes e muito menos \u00e0 sua capacidade \n\ninfecciosa. Tanto quanto se sabe, este trabalho constitui o primeiro trabalho experimental \n\nrealizado em L. monocytogenes, com o objectivo de estudar o sistema de secre\u00e7\u00e3o Tat.  \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave:  \n\nListeria monocytogenes; sistema de secre\u00e7\u00e3o; sistema Tat; mutante de delec\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n  \n\n\n\nvii \n \n\nContents \n\nAcknowlegments ..................................................................................................................... i \n\nAbstract ................................................................................................................................. iii \n\nResumo ................................................................................................................................. iv \n\nFigure Index .......................................................................................................................... ix \n\nTable Index ............................................................................................................................ x \n\n1.

Introduction  \n\n1.1. Listeria monocytogenes \n\n1.1.1. Historical facts  \n\nIn 1924, after an outbreak in laboratory animals in Cambridge, Murray, Webb and Swann \n\nhave isolated a gram-positive bacterium which they named Bacterium monocytogenes (1), \n\ndue to the monocytosis disease observed in the infected animals. This was considered the \n\nofficial discovery of Listeria, which after the name of Bacterium monocytogenes had other \n\nnames as Erysipelothrix, Listerella and finally, Listeria (2), in honor of Lord Lister (3). \n\nDespite its official discovery date in 1924, there is evidence that this organism had probably \n\nbeen observed in histological sections many years before its official discovery and it had \n\nbeen cultivated and described by H\u00fclphers in 1911 (4). \n\nAlthough the clinical descriptions of infection by L. monocytogenes in animals and humans \n\ndate from the twenties of the last century, only in 1952, in Germany, listeriosis was \n\nrecognized as an important cause of neonatal meningitis and septicemia (5). In 1981, L. \n\nmonocytogenes was for the first time associated with the Food Industry and considered as a \n\nfoodborne pathogen, following an outbreak of listeriosis in Nova Scotia, Canada, with 41 \n\ncases and 18 deaths reported, mostly children and pregnant women, epidemiologically linked \n\nby the consumption of coleslaw contaminated with sheep feces containing L. monocytogenes \n\n(6). \n\n \n\n1.1.2. Characteristics  \n\nThe presence of L. monocytogenes in food products is currently considered a risk in the \n\nFood Industry. This pathogenic microorganism affects primarily pregnant women, children, \n\nthe elderly and immunocompromised individuals. This risk becomes more important as the \n\ncases of immunocompromised patients, either by HIV infection or by treatments such as \n\nchemotherapy and radiotherapy, among others increases. \n\nTaxonomically, L. monocytogenes belongs to the Bacteria domain, phylum Firmicutes, class \n\nBacilli, order Bacillales, family Listeriaceae and gender Listeria. Eight species have been \n\ndescribed for the genus Listeria: L. monocytogenes, L. ivanovii, L. seeligeri, L. innocua, L. \n\nwelshimeri, L. grayi, L. marthii (7) and L. rocourtiae (8). L. monocytogenes infects ruminants \n\nand it has been considered the only one pathogenic for humans (9) (10), L. ivanovii was \n\nthought to infect only ruminants but recently a case of infection by this species in a man was \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\nreported, suggesting that the rarity of human listeriosis due to this species can be explained \n\nnot only by the host tropism factors but also by the rare occurrence of this species in the \n\nenvironment, compared with L. monocytogenes (11).  \n\nThirteen serovars (1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 3a, 3b, 3c, 4a, 4ab, 4b, 4c, 4d, 4e and 7), from three \n\ndifferent lineages (lineages I, II and III) have been described for L. monocytogenes (12). \n\nL. monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod-shaped bacterium with dimensions of 0.4 \u00b5m for 1 \n\nto 1.5 \u00b5m. This bacterium has a low G+C content, is a facultative anaerobe, catalase positive \n\nand oxidase negative. It has peritrich flagella, which presence is very limited when grown at \n\n37 ?C (13). L. monocytogenes can grow in a range of temperatures from 1 to 45 ?C (14) (15), \n\nalthough its optimal growth temperature ranges from 30 to 37 ?C. The growth versatility of \n\nthis bacterium is also observed with respect to pH, as it has the ability to grow at pH values \n\nbetween 4.4 and 9.6 (14), although the optimal pH for its growth is neutral or slightly alkaline. \n\nL. monocytogenes is quite tolerant to sodium chloride (10 to 20% (w/v)) (16) (13) (17), bile \n\nsalts (10 to 40% (w/v)), and to some metals, which are usually toxic for other bacteria, such \n\nas lithium, thallium and tellurium. It has also the ability to grow in low water activity (aw) \n\nvalues, equal or greater than 0.92 (18), but its optimal growth occurs at 0.97. \n\n \n\n1.1.3. Infectious cycle \n\nL. monocytogenes is responsible for listeriosis, a disease with a high mortality rate (20% to \n\n30%). In the EU, the number of confirmed cases increased 19% in 2009 compared to 2008 \n\n(19). L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterium. After ingestion of \n\ncontaminated food it is able to cross the intestinal epithelium and disseminate via the lymph \n\nand blood-streams to deeper tissues. The liver and the spleen are primary target organs for \n\nfurther bacterial multiplication, resulting in possible abscess formation (20). One of the main \n\ncharacteristics of L. monocytogenes physiopathology is its capacity of crossing major \n\nepithelial barriers, the blood-brain barrier and the placental barrier, leading to meningo-\n\nencephalitis or fetus infection, ultimately it can eventually cause abortion, stillbirth or neonatal \n\nmeningitis. \n\nBriefly, after being ingested this bacterium has the ability of entering the intestine epithelial \n\ncells and escape from the phagosome, becoming free in the cell cytoplasm. By actin \n\npolymerization it propels through the cell cytoplasm and into the adjacent cell\u2019s outer \n\nmembrane which encapsulates this protuberance and acquires the bacteria that will become \n\nonce again free in the cell cytoplasm (Figure 1).   \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Schematic representation and electron micrographs of the Listeria monocytogenes \nlife cycle. \n\na - L. monocytogenes induces its entry into a non-professional phagocyte. b - Bacteria are internalized in \na vacuole (also known as a phagosome). c,d - The membrane of the vacuole is disrupted by the secretion \nof two phospholipases, PlcA and PlcB, and the pore-forming toxin listeriolysin O.

Bacterial Secretion Systems \n\nBacterial protein secretion is extremely important because secreted proteins are the main \n\ntool used by bacteria to interact with their environment. Bacterial pathogenicity depends \n\ngreatly on the ability of bacteria to secrete virulence factors which are displayed on the \n\nbacterial cell surface, secreted into the extracellular milieu or even injected directly into the \n\nhost cell (22). Many nonpathogenic organisms also secrete proteins that are important for its \n\ngrowth, for example degradative enzymes such as cellulases, secreted by saprophytic \n\nbacteria. \n\nProtein secretion systems have been extensively investigated in a wide range of gram-\n\nnegative bacterial species and six secretion systems were identified (numbered from I to V, \n\nplus the chaperone pathway), although they are not all systematically present in a single \n\nbacterium and its presence and activity varies from one bacterium to another (23). In \n\ncontrast, information about secretion systems in gram-positive bacteria is still essentially \n\nrestricted to Bacillus subtilis, although other studies concerning gram-positive bacteria such \n\nas L. monocytogenes (24) (25) and Staphylococcus aureus (26) (27) are starting to be \n\nreported. \n\nIn gram-positive bacteria seven protein secretion systems are currently recognized: the Sec \n\n(Secretion) pathway; the Tat (Twin-arginine translocation) pathway; the FPE (Fimbrilin-\n\nProtein Exporter); some ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein exporters; the FEA (Flagellum \n\nExport Apparatus); the holins (hole-forming) and the Wss (WXG100 secretion system) (25). \n\nAs occurs in gram-negative bacteria, not all of the secretion pathways are systematically \n\npresent in a single organism, and their respective contribution in protein transportation varies \n\nfrom one organism to another.  \n\nAll the secretion pathways described for gram-positive bacteria were identified in Listeria \n\nmonocytogenes as schematically shown in Figure 2. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\n \n\nFigure  2 \u2013 Schematic representation of the secretion systems and the number of proteins \nsecreted by each system in Listeria monocytogenes.  \n\nSP, signal peptide; Sec, secretion; Tat, twin-arginine translocation; FPE, fimbrilin-protein exporter; ABC, \nATP-binding cassette exporter; FEA, flagella export apparatus; holin, hole forming; Wss, WXG100 \nsecretion system; Cyto, cytoplasm; CM, cytoplasmic membrane; CW, cell wall; EM, extracellular milieu. \nAdapted from Desvaux et al, 2010 (25). \n\n \n\nThe Sec pathway is the major secretion system in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, not only \n\nbecause of the number of proteins considered as exported by this pathway, but also because \n\nof their importance. Although the presence of the Sec pathway in L. monocytogenes has not \n\nbeen experimentally proved, its existence was inferred due to the high number of proteins \n\ncarrying the putative translocation signal peptide and the presence of these proteins in the \n\nextracellular milieu or in the cell surface (28) (29). This system consists of a heterotrimeric \n\nSecYEG complex, which is the central component as it forms a channel in the cytoplasmic \n\nmembrane. A cytosolic ATPase SecA is also essential for protein transport. It acts through \n\ncycles of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding and hydrolysis, thereby facilitating the \n\nbinding of proteins to the system, leading to stepwise export of the proteins (24). In L. \n\nmonocytogenes a SecA paralogue named SecA2 was identified (30) and unlike SecA this is \n\nnot essential for cell viability but it is involved in the secretion of proteins that contribute to \n\nvirulence (31), such as p60 hydrolase (30), NamA (N-acetilmuramidase A) (32) and FbpA \n\n(Fribonectin-binding protein A) (33). \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nThe proteins secreted by the Tat pathway have a N-terminal signal peptide and an essential \n\ntwin arginine motif, (S/T)TRRXFLK, which straddles the N-domain and the hydrophobic H-\n\ndomain (34). Unlike the Sec system, the Tat pathway is considered to secrete proteins in \n\ntheir final conformation (35) and somehow rejects the ones that are unfolded. In L. \n\nmonocytogenes EGDe (serovar 1/2a) only one copy of the genes coding for tatA and tatC \n\nwas identified while in the sequenced L. monocytogenes 4b serovars no genes coding for the \n\nTat pathway were identified.  \n\nThe Fimbrilin-Protein Exporter (FPE) system is responsible for the secretion and \n\nagglomeration of proteins similar to pilin, and its components are encoded in comG locus. \n\nAlthough the existence of this system has never been experimentally demonstrated in L. \n\nmonocytogenes, it is referred because of its similarity with the genetic locus comG of Bacillus \n\nsubtilis. \n\nATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein exporters are transmembrane proteins that utilize the \n\nenergy of ATP hydrolysis to carry out various biological processes, including translocation of \n\nsubstrates across membranes. Only recently this type of system was considered as \n\nresponsible for the secretion of four bacteriocins in L. monocytogenes (25).    \n\nIn gram-negative bacteria, the Flagellum Export Apparatus (FEA) is related with the type III \n\nsecretion system, together with the Hrp (Hypersensitive response and pathogenicity) pilus \n\nexport apparatus and the injectisome export apparatus (24). From the nine FEA components \n\nidentified in gram-negative bacteria, seven were identified in Listeria, FlhA, FlhB, FliP, FliQ, \n\nFliR, FliI and FliH. \n\nHolins are small membrane proteins that allow the transport across the cytoplasmic \n\nmembrane of proteins lacking N-terminal signal sequences. These proteins, which derived \n\nfrom phages, are involved in the secretion and activation of proteins with murein hydrolyzing \n\nactivity in early stages of cell lysis, which is very important for apoptosis. Holins are homo-\n\noligomeric complexes that form pores in the cytoplasmic membrane, allowing an energy \n\nindependent translocation of proteins (24). \n\n The Wss system is formed by a protein with 100 amino acids, which has a coil-coil domain \n\nand a conserved WXG motif, called WXG100 and a membrane-bound ATPase, homologous \n\nto B. subtilis YukAB. In Listeria only one copy of the gene coding for the protein YukAB was \n\nidentified, which is also present in the non-pathogenic species L. innocua (36).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\n1.3. The Tat Pathway \n\nThe twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway is responsible for the secretion of proteins in \n\ntheir folded conformation and, as referred before, targeted proteins to be secreted via Tat \n\npathway have a N-terminal consensus motif [(S/T)TRRXFLK] (34). The energy required for \n\nprotein translocation is exclusively acquired from the transmembrane proton electrochemical \n\ngradient (?p) (37).  \n\nThis secretion system was first characterized in plant chloroplasts and in 1998 a homologous \n\nbacterial Tat pathway was identified in Escherichia coli, encoded by the tat genes (tatA, tatB, \n\ntatC and tatE) (38).  \n\nIn gram-negative bacteria, where this pathway was first identified in prokaryotes, the Tat \n\ntranslocation requires three integral membrane proteins belonging to TatA, TatB and TatC \n\nfamilies, and all of them have been demonstrated to be essential for protein translocation  \n\n(Figure 3A) (34). \n\n \n\nMost gram-positive bacteria and \n\nArchaea possess a simpler and \n\nminimalist Tat pathway as only tatA \n\nand tatC genes are present, lacking the \n\ngene for TatB component, which \n\nfunction is performed by a bifunctional \n\nTatA component (Figure 3B) (39). \n\nAlthough the TatB is missing in gram-\n\npositive bacteria, it has been proved its \n\nfunctionality in B.subtilis. This operon \n\n(tatAdCd, named d due to the \n\nexistence of more than one copy of \n\nthese genes in B. subtilis genome) was \n\nexpressed in an E. coli tat null mutant \n\nand its ability to export several Tat \n\nsubstrates was proved (39). \n\n \n\nDespite the differences between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, homologues of \n\nE. coli tat genes have been identified  in the genomes of many bacterial pathogens, including \n\nE. coli O:157, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Vibrio cholerae, \n\nFigure  3 \u2013 Schematic representation of Tat \npathways (A) in gram-negative and (B) gram-\npositive bacteria.  \n\nPP, periplasm; IM, inner membrane; CP, cytoplasm; Ext, \nextracellular milieu; CM, cytoplasmic membrane. \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\nHelicobacter pylori, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, L. monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, \n\nLegionella pneumophila, Neisseria meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella \n\nmultocida, Yersinia pestis, Xanthomonas campestris, X. axonopodis, Xyllela fastidiosa, S. \n\naureus and Ralstonia solanacearum (38). For some of these pathogens the importance of \n\nthe Tat pathway was assessed and studied in detail. Those studies proved the involvement \n\nof the Tat pathway in different lifestyles of bacteria, from saprophytic to pathogenic. \n\nTranslocation of proteins by this system showed to be important for E. coli O157:H7 motility, \n\nfor infection and iron acquisition in P. aeruginosa and for cell growth, division and biofilm \n\nformation in L. pneumophila (38). In S. aureus, a bacterium taxonomically closer to L. \n\nmonocytogenes, there are evidences of the Tat pathway function in transporting an iron-\n\ndependent peroxidase (FepB) and its need to successful in vivo infection was shown (26).   \n\n \n\nIn L. monocytogenes EGDe, the two proteins which constitute the Tat pathway are encoded \n\nin the genes lmo0361 and lmo0362. The gene located four genes away of the tat genes \n\ncorresponds to the gene coding for an iron-dependent Dyp-peoxidase (lmo0367), with 40 % \n\nsimilarity to FepB of S. aureus considered secreted by the Tat pathway. This indicates that \n\nprobably Lmo0367 is also secreted by the Tat system. This protein is part of an operon \n\nformed by genes lmo0365, lmo0366 and lmo0367 (40), all of them related with iron. Between \n\nthe two locus mentioned there is a gene coding for a peptidase and a transcriptional \n\nregulator, lmo0363 and lmo0364, respectively. A schematic representation of the locus \n\ncoding for the Tat Pathway and the protein putatively secreted by this system is shown in \n\nFigure 4.   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  4 \u2013 Organization of the genes coding for the Tat pathway and the lmo0365-7 operon of \nListeria monocytogenes EGDe.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\n2.

The \n\npellets were resuspended in 100 \u00b5L 1xPBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4, \n\n1.47 mM KH2PO4, adjusted to a final pH of 7.4) and 5 \u00b5L of lysozyme (10 mg/mL) was \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\nadded, following 15 min incubation at 37 ?C, with shaking. The DNA was extracted and \n\npurified using FastDNA kit and protocol from Bio101 (Bio101, USA). \n\nThe DNA quality and concentration was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% \n\nagarose). \n\n \n\n2.4. Construction of mutants \n\n2.4.1. Construction of double deletion mutant strain (L. monocytogenes EGDe \n\n?lmo0361 ?lmo0362) \n\nIn order to generate the lmo0361 lmo0362 double deletion mutant, an approximately 1000 \n\nbasepair (bp) large region upstream of lmo0362 and downstream of lmo0361 was generated \n\nfrom L. monocytogenes EGDe genomic DNA. To generate these regions, a standard \n\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using DNA polymerase high-fidelity \n\n(Fermentas, Canada), primers Tat_A together with Tat_B, and primers Tat_C together with \n\nTat_D, as listed in Appendix 1 (for schematic representation see Figure 5). The first fragment \n\n(AB) was digested with restriction enzymes SalI and MluI and cloned in the temperature \n\nsensitive plasmid pMAD (Appendix 2), resulting the pMAD-TatAB plasmid. The second \n\nfragment (CD) was digested with restriction enzymes MluI and BglII and cloned in the pMAD-\n\nTatAB plasmid, resulting the pMAD-TatAD plasmid which had two approximately 1000 bp \n\nregion, each homologous to the up and down-stream of the genes of interest. \n\nThe pMAD-TatAD plasmid was electroporated into L. monocytogenes EGDe, according to \n\nPark et al. (47). To induce chromosomal integration of the pMAD-TatAD, the cells were \n\ngrown at a non permissive temperature (42 ?C) on BHI plates containing erythromycin (5 \n\n\u00b5g/mL). Colonies containing the integrated plasmid were grown for eleven days at a \n\npermissive temperature (30 ?C) without antibiotics, allowing the plasmid excision from the \n\nchromosome and its loss from the cell, thus allowing excising the genes lmo0361 and \n\nlmo0362 from the chromosome (schematic representation of gene deletion in Appendix 3). \n\nFinally, the presence of lmo0361 and lmo0362 regions was investigated through \n\namplification from the resulting mutants using the internal primers for both genes, TatA_fw \n\nwith TatA_rv and TatC_fw with TatC_rv, respectively (for schematic representation see \n\nFigure 5). \n\n \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n \n\nFigure  5 \u2013 Schematic representation of primer annealing positions for primers used in the \nconstruction of the tatAC deletion mutant. \n\n \n\n2.4.2. Construction of deletion mutant strain (L. monocytogenes EGDe ?lmo0364) \n\nIn order to generate the lmo0364 (transcription regulator) deletion mutant, an approximately \n\n400 bp large region upstream and downstream of lmo0364 was generated from L. \n\nmonocytogenes EGDe genomic DNA. To generate these regions, a standard polymerase \n\nchain reaction (PCR) was done using Phusion polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland), primers P1-\n\nlmo0364 and P2-lmo0364, and primers P3-lmo0364 together with P4-lmo0364, as listed in \n\nAppendix 1. The resulting products were used to produce an approximately 800 bp fragment \n\nby splicing by overlap extension (SOE-ing) (48). After digestion of this fragment with EcoRI \n\nand BamHI it was cloned in the temperature sensitive plasmid pAULA (Appendix 2) resulting \n\nthe pAULA\u2013?lmo0364, which construction was confirmed by sequencing with primers pAUL-\n\n1 and pAUL-2 (Appendix 1).  \n\nThe pAULA\u2013?lmo0364 plasmid was electroporated into L. monocytogenes EGDe (47). To \n\ninduce chromosomal integration of the pAULA\u2013?lmo0364, the cells were grown at a non \n\npermissive temperature (42 ?C) on BHI plates containing erythromycin (5 \u00b5g/mL). Colonies \n\ncontaining the integrated plasmid were grown for eight days at a permissive temperature (30 \n\n?C) without antibiotics, allowing the plasmid excision from the chromosome and its loss from \n\nthe cell, thus allowing the excision of gene lmo0364 from the chromosome (schematic \n\nrepresentation of gene deletion in Appendix 3). Finally, to confirm that the gene was deleted \n\nfrom the chromosome, the lmo0364 region was amplified in wild-type and mutant strain DNA \n\nfollowing sequencing using primers PC1_lmo0364 and PC2_lmo0364 (Appendix 1). \n\n \n\n2.5. Preparation of total RNA \n\nOvernight cultures of L. monocytogenes strains were diluted to an A600 = 0.02 in BHI \n\n(corresponding to time 0) and grown at 37 ?C. At various time points (3, 4.5, 6 and 8 hours) \n\n20 mL samples of the growing cultures were shortly cooled in liquid nitrogen (N2) and the \n\ncells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 g for 3 min at 4 ?C, snap frozen in liquid \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\nnitrogen and stored at -80 ?C. The cells were resuspended in 900 \u00b5L TRI reagent \n\n(MRCGENE, USA) and lysed using a FastPrep instrument. RNA was subsequently extracted \n\nusing chloroform and precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate, overnight at -80 ?C. The \n\nsamples were centrifuged at 20000 g for 30 min at 4 ?C, washed with 70% ethanol (-20 ?C) \n\nand resuspended in 50 \u00b5L Milli-Q water.  \n\nThe RNA quality and quantification was assessed on a NanoDrop 2000. The integrity and the \n\npredicted concentration of the RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% \n\nagarose). \n\n \n\n2.6. Northern blot analysis \n\nFor Northern blotting, loading buffer (95% formamide and 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% BPB and \n\n0.05% xylene cyanol) was added to 10 \u00b5g of total RNA and samples were boiled at 95 ?C for \n\n3 min (to denaturate the RNA) and immediately cooled on ice. The total RNA was separated \n\non a 4% polyacrylamide-7M urea gel and transferred to a Zeta probe nylon membrane (Bio-\n\nRad, USA) by semi-dry electroblotting at 400 mA for 2 hours. \n\nFor detection of RNA, the membranes were pre-incubated for 30 min at 42 ?C in PerfectHyb \n\nhybridization buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and hybridized with a specific \n32\n\nP-labelled DNA \n\nprobe, prepared using poly nucleotide kinase (PNK) (Fermentas, Canada) and ?-[\n32\n\nP]-ATP \n\n(PerkinElmer, USA). The membranes were then washed with a 2X saline-sodium citrate \n\n(SSC), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution for 5 min and a 0.5X SSC, 0.1% SDS \n\nsolution for 20 min, both at 42 ?C, and finally visualized by phosphor imaging using a \n\nTyphoon scanner.    \n\n \n\n2.7. Transcriptional fusions \n\nThe promoter regions of lmo0361, lmo0362, lmo0363, lmo0364 and lmo0365-lmo0367, \n\nrespectively (see Figure 4 in the Introdution, section 1.3.) were amplified from L. \n\nmonocytogenes EGDe chromosomal DNA under standard PCR conditions using Phusion \n\npolymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) with primers listed in Appendix 2. The resulting products of \n\napproximately 200 bp were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned in the low copy-\n\nnumber plasmid pTCV-lac (Appendix 2). The construction was confirmed by sequencing with \n\nprimers vLac1 and vLac2 (Appendix 1). \n\nThe constructed plamids, pTCV-lmo0361, pTCV-lmo0362, pTCV-lmo0363, pTCV-lmo0364 \n\nand pTCV-lmo0365 were each one electroporated into L. monocytogenes EGDe, ?lmo0361 \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n?lmo0362 and ?lmo0364 (47) strains. Transformants were selected by kanamycin \n\nresistance. \n\n \n\n2.8. Beta-galactosidase assay \n\nStrains for testing ?-galactosidase activity were diluted from an overnight culture to an \n\nA600=0.02 in BHI. At different growth times (3, 4, 5, 7 and 24 hours) 1 mL of each sample \n\nwere collected by centrifugation at 14000 g for 4 min, thoroughly aspirated, frozen and stored \n\nat -80 ?C until use. For the assay, the pelleted cells were thawn on ice and resuspended in 1 \n\nmL Z-buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, pH 7.0). Cells \n\nwere permeabilized by adding 0.5 % toluene and 4.5 % ethanol, vortexing after each \n\naddition. From the permeabilized cell suspension, 100 \u00b5L was mixed with 400 \u00b5L of Ortho-\n\nnitrophenyl-?-galactosidase (ONPG) solution (1 mg/mL ONPG, 0.075 % SDS dissolved in Z-\n\nbuffer) and incubated at 37 ?C until the samples present a yellow colour (A420 ? 0.6 - 0.9). \n\nWhen this colour was reached, the reaction was stopped by addition of 500 \u00b5L of 1 M \n\nNa2CO3.  \n\nThe ?-galactosidase activity was determined as described by Miller (49), using the equation: \n\n                                             \n              \n\n        \n ,  \n\nwhere t is the time of reaction in minutes, v is the volume of culture used in the assay (mL), \n\nA420 and A550 is the absorbance of the ? \u2013galactosidase sample at 420 nm and 550 nm, \n\nrespectively, and A600 is the absorbance of the cell culture when harvested. \n\nStrains carrying an empty vector were also subjected to ?-galactosidase measurements and \n\nthis background activity was subtracted of the obtained data. \n\n \n\n2.9. Secreted protein analysis \n\n2.9.1. Bacterial cultures \n\nL. monocytogenes strains were cultured overnight at 37 ?C on TSA-YE. A single isolated \n\ncolonie was suspended in 25 mL of minimal medium MWB (46) and incubated overnight at \n\n37 ?C with shaking. Overnight cultures were adjusted to an A600 = 0.05 using fresh MWB and \n\ngrown at the same conditions used before (37 ?C with shaking) for about 20 hours. The cells \n\nwere harvested at exponential phase (A600 ? 0.8) by centrifugation (3 000 g, 10 min, 4 ?C). \n\nThe obtained supernatants were filtered with 0.22 \u00b5m Millipore Express Membranes and \n\nphenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM (29). \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\n15 \n \n\n \n\n2.9.2. Protein precipitation \n\nThe proteins present in the supernatants were precipitated with 0.2 mg/mL sodium \n\ndeoxycholate (DOC) for 30 min at 4 ?C, followed by addition of 6 % (w/v) trichloroacetic acid \n\n(TCA) and overnight incubation at 4 ?C. The precipitate was centrifuged (17 900 g, 15 min, 4 \n\n?C), washed with ice-cold acetone and resuspended in Milli-Q water. \n\n \n\n2.9.3. Protein quantification  \n\nProtein concentration was determined by a modified Lowry method (50) using the bovine \n\nserum albumin (BSA) as standard. \n\n \n\n2.9.4. SDS-PAGE \n\nSamples containing 50 \u00b5g of total protein were dissolved in sample buffer: 80 mM Tris-HCl, \n\npH 6.8, containing 2 % (w/v) SDS, 0.1 mM ?-mercaptoethanol, 15 % glycerol and 0.01 % \n\n(w/v) m-cresol purple. Samples were then heated at 100 ?C for 4 min and submitted to SDS-\n\nPAGE 15 % (w/v) in gels with 8 cm x 7.3 cm x 0.75 mm, on a Mini-PROTEAN 3 Cell (Bio-\n\nRad, USA). \n\nSeparated proteins were visualized by colloidal Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 staining (51). \n\nApparent masses were calculated based on the molecular masses of standard LPM (14 to \n\n66 kDa) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). \n\n \n\n2.10. In vitro test of virulence \n\n2.10.1. Cell line and culture conditions \n\nThe human adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 (ECACC n.\u00ba 850611109) was used between \n\npassages 62 and 64. Cells were routinely grown in 75 cm\n2\n flasks in high glucose Dulbecco\u2019s \n\nmodified Eagle\u2019s medium (D-MEM) (Gibco/Invitrogen, UK), supplemented with sodium \n\nbicarbonate (3.7 g/L), fetal calf serum (10% (v/v)) and L-glutamine (2mM) (complete \n\nmedium). Penicillin (100 IU/mL) and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g/mL) were always added to the \n\nculture medium except for the medium used 24 hours prior to the virulence assays. Cells \n\nwere maintained in a humidified atmosphere using an incubator at 37 ?C under 5% (v/v) CO2 \n\nin air. \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n2.10.2. Plaque-forming assay (PFA) \n\nHT-29 cells were trypsinized from the 75 cm\n2\n flasks and 3 x 10\n\n4\n cells were deposited per well \n\nin a 96-well tissue culture plate. To obtain confluent monolayers, the plates were incubated \n\nfor 3 days with antibiotics followed by incubation for 24 h without antibiotics. \n\nThe overnight grown Listeria strains (TSA-YE, 37 ?C) were suspended in buffered saline to a \n\nconcentration of 4 x 10\n8\n cell mL\n\n-1\n and serial dilutions were made in complete medium. HT-29 \n\ncell monolayers were infected with dilution series of 10\n2\n to 10\n\n7\n L. monocytogenes cells per \n\nwell, and incubated for 2 h at 37 ?C. The inocula concentration was assessed by duplicate \n\nplating of the appropriate dilutions onto TSA-YE and incubation at 37 ?C for 24 h, before \n\ncounting colonies.  \n\nAfter 2 h incubation with the bacterial cells, the suspensions were removed and cell \n\nmonolayers were incubated for 1.5 h with complete D-MEM medium containing 100 \u00b5g \n\ngentamicin mL\n-1\n, and lacking penicillin and streptomycin. The wells were then covered with \n\ncomplete D-MEM medium supplemented with 10 \u00b5g gentamicin mL\n-1\n and 2.5 % (m/v) \n\nagarose. Once the agar media was solidified, complete medium was added to the top of the \n\nagar media to prevent cell starvation. Culture plates were incubated for 24 to 48 h at 37 ?C \n\nunder 5 % (v/v) CO2 in air. Formed plaques were counted 24 h after bacteria deposition on \n\nthe HT-29 cell monolayer, and confirmed after 48 h of incubation. Enumeration of the \n\nplaques was done using an inverted microscope (52) (53).  \n\n \n\n2.11. In vivo test of virulence \n\nTo test the in vivo pathogenicity by subcutaneous injection (50 \u00b5L) of the wild-type and the \n\nmutants, seven-week-old immunocompetent Swiss female mice were used (54). They were \n\nmaintained on sterilized wood shavings with free access to water and sterilized food. For \n\neach isolate, groups of five mice were inoculated subcutaneously into the left hind footpad. \n\nBacterial strains were grown on BHI plates for 17 hours at 37 ?C. The culture was \n\nstandardized turbidimetrically and diluted appropriately in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, \n\npH 7.3) to obtain 4 log CFU (colony forming unit) in 50 \u00b5L for subcutaneous infection. The \n\ninocula used were verified by determining viable counts on TSA (Trypic Soy Agar) plates.  \n\nMice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation three days after subcutaneous injection and \n\nspleens were aseptically removed. Homogenate samples were appropriately diluted in PBS \n\nand plated onto TSA plates. Viable numbers of bacteria were assessed after incubation at 37 \n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n?C for 48 hours. Animal handling and care conditions were consistent for all experimental \n\nruns. \n\n \n\n2.12. Expression of results and data analysis  \n\nFor SDS-PAGE gels, the images were analyzed and band quantification was done using the \n\ndensitometric curves obtained in the Gel Compare II version 5.1 (Applied Maths, Belgium).  \n\nFor the ?-galatosidase assay, the promoter activities were expressed as the mean of ?-\n\ngalactosidase units, from experiments done in duplicate, from three independent trials. The \n\nstandard deviation was also assessed and it is shown in the graphic representations of \n\npromoter activities. \n\nFor the in vitro test, the pathogenic potential of the isolates was expressed as the mean log \n\nof the number of plaques formed (for 10\n7\n Listeria per well) (log PFA), in duplicate, from at \n\nleast two independent trials. ANOVA of the log PFA values from the plaque-forming isolates \n\nwas carried out using least significant differences (LSD) post hoc multiple comparison tests \n\nby running the program Statistica, version 6 (Statsoft). \n\nFor the mouse virulence assay, the virulence potential of the isolates was expressed as the \n\nmean log of the number of colony forming units (log CFU) per spleen, multiplied by the ratio \n\nof number of positive cultures in the spleen to inoculated mice in the subcutaneous infection \n\ntest. The significant differences between strains were assessed using the log CFU mean and \n\nthe standard deviations by applying a t-test.  \n\nThose values whose probability of occurrence was greater than 95 % (p &lt;0.05) were \n\nconsidered as significant values. \n\n\n\nResults \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n3. Results  \n\n3.1. Deletion mutant for the Tat pathway \n\nTo investigate the importance of the Tat pathway in L. monocytogenes, a deletion mutant for \n\nthe genes coding for this system was constructed as described before in section 2.3.1. The \n\nconfirmation of the deletion of the genes was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), \n\nusing internal primers for the genes lmo0361 (tatA) and lmo0362 (tatC) as well as the \n\nprimers Tat_A and Tat_D, used in the production of the homologous fragment for gene \n\nreplacement (for primers sequence see Appendix 1). As a PCR control, internal primers for \n\nthe L. monocytogenes iap gene were used.  \n\nThe mutant strain showed a ~2000 bp band, the same size as the constructed plasmid \n\n(Figure 6), which represents ~1000 bp upstream lmo0362 and ~1000 bp downstream \n\nlmo0361. The wild-type strain EGDe presented a ~3000 bp band. The difference between \n\nthe mutant and the wild-type was explained by the deletion of tatA and tatC (911 bp) (Figure \n\n6). The amplification done using the internal primers for the genes lmo0361 (tatC) and \n\nlmo0362 (tatA) resulted in no bands for the mutant and a band of ~200 bp for the wild-type \n\nstrain, as expected. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  6 \u2013 Polymerase chain reaction results confirming the construction of a tatAC deletion \nmutant from the parent strain L. monocytogenes EGDe.  \n\n1% agarose gel.

The wild-type showed a \u00b5max = 1.26 h\n-1\n and the mutant showed a \u00b5max = 1.31 \n\nh\n-1\n, showing that Tat pathway is not essential for L. monocytogenes survival. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  7 \u2013 Growth curves of L. monocytogenes EGDe and EGDe ?tatAC mutant grown in \ncomplete medium (BHI) at 37 ?C. \n\n \n\n3.2. Transcriptional analysis \n\n3.2.1. Northern blot \n\nThe transcription of the genes lmo0361 (tatC) and lmo0362 (tatA) was analyzed during the \n\nexponential and stationary phase. The total RNA was analyzed by Northern blot, by using \n\nprobes for genes lmo0361, lmo0362, lmo0363 and a control probe for 16S rRNA gene \n\n(Appendix 1). The genes lmo0361 and lmo0362 presented the same pattern of expression \n\n(Figure 8). The same RNA was observed with both probes indicating that genes lmo0361 \n\nand lmo0362 are transcribed in a bicistronic manner. The transcription of tatAC genes was \n\ngrowth-phase dependent, since it seemed to be less expressed in the stationary phase, in \n\ncomparison to the exponential phase, as shown in Figure 8. As expected, no transcripts were \n\ndetected in the deletion mutant. \n\nProteins exported by the Tat pathway have a conserved N-terminus motif which is cleaved \n\nwhen the protein is secreted. The gene lmo0363 upstream the genes coding for the Tat \n\npathway codes for a peptidase and it is located just 96 bp from lmo0362 (see Figure 4 in \n\nsection 1.3.). To investigate if gene lmo0363 is transcribed together with genes lmo0362 and \n\n\n\nResults \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nlmo0361 a Northern blot analysis for this gene was also performed (Figure 8). Transcripts of \n\nthe lmo0363 were practically undetectable and showed to be transcribed independently from \n\nlmo0362 and lmo0361.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  8 \u2013 Northern blot analysis of lmo0361, lmo0362 and lmo0363 transcripts in wild-type \nand tatAC mutant strain. RNA was isolated from both strains at different times of growth (3.5, 5, \n6 and 8 hours, signed with an arrow in growth curve), corresponding to the exponential and \nstationary phases. \n\n \n\nThe locus for lmo0361 and lmo0362 in L. monocytogenes EGDe (serovar 1/2a) is similar to a \n\nlocus present in the nonpathogenic L. innocua, but it is absent in the genome of the L. \n\nmonocytogenes F2365 (serovar 4b) (55).  \n\nBetween the genes coding for the secretion system and the operon containing the gene for \n\nthe secreted protein, there is a gene coding for a transcription regulator (lmo0364) (see \n\nFigure 4 in section 1.3.).  \n\nTo address the possible involvement of this transcription regulator in transcription regulation \n\nof genes tatA and tatC, a new transcription analysis was performed. For that a deletion \n\nmutant in this gene was also constructed. In the deletion mutant, the resulting protein lacks in \n\nthe N-terminal, including the DNA-binding domain, 247 amino acids, out of 313 that \n\nconstitute Lmo0364.  \n\nThe results in Figure 9 show that the lmo0364 gene product has no influence in the \n\ntranscription of tatA and tatC, since no difference between the mutant and the wild-type \n\nstrain was detected. \n\n\n\nResults \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n \n\nFigure  9 - Northern blot analysis of lmo0361, lmo0362 and lmo0363 transcripts in wild-type, \ntatAC and lmo0364 mutant strains.

Promoter activity \n\nThe promoter activity of the genes lmo0361, lmo0362, lmo0363, lmo0364 and of the operon \n\nlmo0365-67 was analyzed for the wild-type strain using a ?-galactosidase assay.  \n\nInterestingly, the promoters showed different levels of activity, with lmo0362 being the most \n\nactive promoter, followed by the operon lmo0365-67 promoter (Figure 10). Although \n\ntranscripts of the gene lmo0363 were undetectable in the Northern blot, promoter activity was \n\nlow but recorded. Even much lower than the activity of the lmo0362 and lmo0365 promoters, \n\nthe transcription regulator lmo0364 also showed promoter activity (Figure 10). The promoter \n\nof lmo0361 gene showed no promoter activity when compared to the empty plasmid \n\ndemonstrating once more that this gene is not transcribed on its own but in a bicistronic \n\ntranscript with lmo0362. \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Determination of \npromoter activity by using \nlacZ fusion.  \n\nPromoter activity was \nmeasured for strains containing \nthe empty plasmid and \nplasmids with the promoter \nregions of the genes lmo0361, \nlmo0362, lmo0363, lmo0364 and \nof the operon lmo0365-67, \ndetermined using the ?-\ngalactosidase assay method. \nAll samples were collected after \nfive hours of culture growth in \n\nBHI, at 37 ?C.

The promoter activity \n\nwas investigated at different time points during culture growth (Figure 11). The promoter \n\nactivity of the lmo0362 gene showed an increased activity during exponential phase, followed \n\nby a decrease during the stationary phase.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure  11 \u2013 Comparison of lmo0362 promoter activity at different time points during growth (3, \n\n4, 5, 7 and 24 hours in BHI, at 37 ?C).  \n\nThe presented activities are the averages of three independent experiments each conducted in duplicate. \n\nStandard deviation bars are shown. \n\n \n\nIn order to investigate if the transcription regulator (Lmo0364) was related to the transcription \n\nof the operon lmo0365-67, where the last gene codes for the protein hypothetically secreted \n\nby the Tat pathway (25), and to confirm the result from the Northern blot for lmo0362, the \n\npromoter activity of lmo0362 and lmo0365 (Figure 12 A and B, respectively) was assessed in \n\nthe wild-type and the deletion mutants ?tatAC and ?lmo0364. \n\n\n\nResults \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nFigure  12 \u2013 Determination of promoter activities in the EGDe (wt), ?tatAC and ?lmo0364 mutant \nstrais.

The same could be verified for the lmo0365-67 operon. This operon hosts the \n\ngene coding for the protein putatively secreted by the Tat pathway. Nevertheless, the \n\npromoter activity of the operon was not different in the Tat pathway mutant. \n\nTo confirm that the transcriptional regulator was not associated to the transcription of the \n\ngenes studied and that the results were not disguised by a down regulation of its \n\ntranscription in the growing conditions used, the promoter activity of the lmo0364 was also \n\nassessed. No differences were found among strains (Figure 13) or time points during growth \n\n(data not shown).

Proteomic analysis \n\n3.3.1. SDS-PAGE analysis of secreted proteins \n\nThe hypothesis that L. monocytogenes has a secretion system (Tat pathway) that secretes \n\nonly a single protein was predicted in silico (25).  \n\nIn order to investigate this hypothesis, the secretome of L. monocytogenes, grown in minimal \n\nmedium at both 20 and 37 ?C (the saprophytic and infectious temperatures, respectively) was \n\nanalyzed for differences in the presence or absence of proteins in SDS-PAGE gels (Figure \n\n14). This preliminary analysis showed no relevant differences between the wild-type strain \n\nand the tatAC mutant. The protein predicted to be secreted by the Tat pathway (Lmo0364) \n\nshould present approximately 40 kDa. No identifiable change between the mutant and the \n\nwild-type strain protein patterns was observed at this range size or at any other range sizes \n\n(Figure 14). \n\nAt 20 ?C, the most intense band (between 29 and 36 kDa, marked with an arrow) is thicker in \n\nthe mutant compared to the wild-type. Its relative amount was assessed using Gel Compare \n\nII version 5.1 (Applied Maths, Belgium), showing that there was a relatively higher amount \n\n(1.3 times) in the ?tatAC mutant when compared with EGDe wild-type. By comparison with \n\npreviously identified bands from other strains of the same serovar 1/2a (data not published), \n\nthis could be flagellin, the main constituent of the flagellar filament.   \n\n \n\n\n\nResults \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n \n\nFigure  14 - The secretome of L. monocytogenes strains grown in minimal medium and \nharvested at late exponential phase (A600 = 0.8).  \n\n(A) Cells grown at 37 ?C.

In vitro virulence \n\nThe importance of the secretion systems in virulence is related with the fact that the bacterial \n\nvirulence depends on the ability to secrete virulence factors. To assess if the absence of the \n\nTat pathway influenced the infectious ability of the tatAC mutant, plaque forming assays \n\n(PFAs) were performed (Table 3). These assays allow the evaluation, not only of the \n\nadhesion of the bacteria to the epithelial cells, but also its ability to internalize, multiply inside \n\nthe host cell and migrate from one cell to another.  \n\n \n\nTable 3 \u2013 In vitro virulence potential of EGDe wild-type strain and ?tatAC mutant. \n\nStrain Plaque forming assay \n\nMean (log \u00b1 SD)\na\n \n\nEGDe 6.24 \u00b1 0.46 \n\nEGDe ?tatAC 6.46 \u00b1 0.36 \n\n442\nb\n 3.69 \u00b1 0.13 \n\na\n Number of plaques formed for 10\n\n7\n Listeria per well.

In vivo virulence \n\nAlthough in vitro results are a good methodology for the evaluation of some steps of the \n\ninfectious cycle, when using animal models the whole process of infection is much more \n\ncomplex and more challenging for the bacteria.  \n\nThe Tat pathway has been described as responsible for the secretion of an iron dependent \n\ndyp-peroxidase (product of gene lmo0367), and iron is one of the key factors for \n\npathogenesis. The pathogens need to keep the iron under a strict regulation and, therefore, \n\nan in vivo study of virulence was performed for the wild type and the deletion mutants ?tatAC \n\nand ?lmo0364 (Table 4). \n\n \n\nTable 4 \u2013 In vivo virulence potential of EGDe wild-type and mutant strains. \n\nStrain Subcutaneous test (spleens) \n\nMean (log \u00b1 SD)\na\n \n\nNumber of positive \n\ncultures (spleen) \n\nEGDe 4.01 \u00b1 0.24 5/5 \n\nEGDe ?tatAC 4.99 \u00b1 0.48 5/5 \n\nEGDe ?lmo0364 4.26 \u00b1 0.28 5/5 \n\na \nNumber of bacteria per spleen homogenate.

Discussion  \n\n4.1. The Tat pathway in Listeria monocytogenes \n\nIn the present study, a L. monocytogenes mutant strain lacking the genes coding for the Tat \n\npathway was successfully constructed (EGDe ?tatAC). Like the parent strain, the mutant \n\nshowed the ability to grow, in both complete and minimal medium, comfirming that the Tat \n\npathway is not essential for L. monocytogenes survival. \n\nFor other species, it has been reported that the tat genes are organized in an operon, but, to \n\nour knowledge, this is the first time that it is experimentally demonstrated that lmo0361 (tatC) \n\nand lmo0362 (tatA) genes in L. monocytogenes are co-transcribed in a bicistronic and \n\ngrowth-phase dependent manner. Transcription of these genes occurs rather in the early \n\nexponential phase, being down regulated in the stationary phase. This was confirmed by \n\nNorthern blot analysis and by the promoter activity determination of lmo0362 and the null \n\nactivity found for lmo0361 supposed promoter region. Even though transcription of the genes \n\nwas shown, the Tat pathway functionality still remains to be elucidated.  \n\nPrevious studies showed that the genes coding for this secretion system were under the \n\nnegative regulation of CtsR, a transcriptional repressor of class III stress response genes, \n\nand ?\nB\n, an alternative sigma factor that positively regulates the transcription of class II stress \n\nresponse genes (56). It has also been shown that Fur, a regulator of iron acquisition \n\nsystems, was responsible for down regulation of the tatAC genes (40). \n\nThe growth-phase dependent transcription observed for tatA and tatC is similar to the one \n\ndescribed for the fri gene, which codes for a ferritin-like protein and is under the direct \n\nregulation of Fur (57).  Even though the tat genes may be under direct or indirect regulation \n\nby different proteins, its transcription pattern, similar to the fri gene, suggests a participation \n\nof Fur in the observed down regulation.  \n\nFur has been studied and some direct interactions between Fur and several promoter \n\nregions were identified (fur boxes). For some repression activities, Fur binding to fur boxes \n\nhas been shown to be iron dependent, but iron independent when binding different fur boxes \n\npromoters (40). The pathways involved in this mechanism are still unclear.  \n\nWhile transcription of tatAC showed to be growth-phase dependent by Northern blot \n\nanalysis, this was not evident when promoter activity was assessed, even though a slight \n\ndecrease of activity was observed in the stationary phase. This can be explained by the \n\nabsence of the CtsR binding site previously identified for tatA promoter region in L. \n\nmonocytogenes (56). CtsR binding site is located around 270 bp upstream the starting codon \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\n28 \n \n\nof tatA (56), in the coding region of lmo0363, and was absent in the construction used for \n\npromoter activity determination. Furthermore, its distance from the starting site of tatAC, as \n\nwell as the verification of promoter activity 152 bp upstream of the coding region and its \n\ndown regulation in the stationary phase, seem to be indicative of the independence of direct \n\nregulation by CtsR at the locus previously identified. The down regulation verified in the \n\npromoter activity in the stationary phase can then be attributed to other regulators of these \n\ngenes. The lower level of transcripts in the stationary phase can also be explained by a pos-\n\ntranscriptional regulation, such as mRNA degradation. \n\nThe results obtained in this work with the wild-type and the ?tatAC mutant transformed with \n\nthe lmo0362 promoter region, combined with the Northern blot analysis for tatAC genes, \n\nsuggest that tatAC expression is not regulated by the level of their product, showing the \n\nsame promoter activity and level of transcripts both in the wild-type and in the mutant strain. \n\nPreviously in silico analysis (25) pointed to a 40 kDa protein secreted by the Tat pathway. \n\nThe SDS-PAGE analysis of L. monocytogenes secretome did not show differences between \n\nthe EGDe wild-type and the ?tatAC mutant, although it does not mean that the protein was \n\nnot present. It could be present in undetectable levels by the method used. FLAG-tag \n\nmethodology (58) is an alternative methodology that could be used to assess the presence of \n\nthe protein both in the supernatant and in the cytoplasm, with a higher detection capability. \n\nFor the observed intensity difference of bands possibly corresponding to flagellin (Figure \n\n14B), no plausible explanation was found, although a CtsR mutant was described in L. \n\nmonocytogenes as having reduced flaA transcription and FlaA expression (59), showing that \n\nthe repressor CtsR appears somehow connected to both flaA and tatAC. Further \n\nexperimental studies will be needed in order to prove the involvement of the Tat pathway in \n\nthe secretion of Lmo0367 and to identify other proteins possibly secreted by this system. \n\nConsidering strains virulence ability, the presence of Tat pathway showed to be irrelevant for \n\nin vitro virulence, but significant differences were found when in vivo virulence was assessed. \n\nSurprisingly, the differences verified in vivo showed that the tat mutant was significantly more \n\nvirulent (p &lt;0.05) than the wild-type strain. This result was unexpected as the only protein \n\nconsidered as secreted by the Tat pathway, Lmo0367, is a peroxidase, pointed by some \n\nauthors as a possible new major virulence factor (25). This protein should be important in the \n\nhost environment, where oxidative stress due to release of reactive oxygen intermediates \n\ntakes place (60). It is also interesting to notice an increase of in vivo virulence of tat mutants, \n\nas serovar 4b strains, which are usually more involved in clinical cases, appear to be lacking \n\nthe genes coding either for the Tat pathway and the lmo0365-67 operon (55). This may \n\nindicate that, instead of being useful and necessary for virulence, the Tat pathway and \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\n29 \n \n\npossibly the iron-dependent peroxidase Lmo0367 might be, on the other hand, impairing \n\nvirulence.  \n\n \n\n4.2. The lmo0365-67 operon  \n\nA first reported in silico analysis identified two proteins secreted via Tat pathway: Lmo0367 \n\nand Lmo2201 (24). Recently, another study reported that Lmo2201 was most certainly a 50S \n\nribosomal protein L35 and, therefore, it could not be secreted. Thus, only the protein \n\nLmo0367 is considered to be secreted by this secretion system (25). The gene coding for \n\nthis protein is part of an operon where lmo0365 and lmo0366 are also present (40). These \n\nthree genes are related to iron, as lmo0365 and lmo0366 code for a transporter and a \n\nlipoprotein, respectively, both involved in iron transport, while lmo0367 codes, as already \n\nmentioned, for an iron-dependent peroxidase.  \n\nA similar operon was identified in Staphylococcus spp., where a peroxidase (FepB), similar \n\nto Lmo0367, was demonstrated to be secreted by the Tat pathway. In S. aureus, tatAC \n\ngenes are right downstream the iron-operon, similar to lmo0365-67 (26). Although the \n\nproteins encoded in the operon are similar to those found in Listeria, their organization is \n\ndifferent, raising once again the question of its origin, since it has been shown that this \n\nsecretion system is also present only in some Staphylococcus species. Biswas et al. (26) \n\nsupport the possibility that, in Staphylococcus, the cluster holding the genes tat and the iron-\n\nrelated operon have phage origin and therefore the phage would probably be the \n\ntransmission vector among different species (26). This hypothesis was based on the fact that \n\nit was identified a gene coding for a protein similar to a phage envelop protein, immediately \n\nupstream of tatA.  \n\nHere we demonstrated that the promoter of this operon has a strong activity, although less \n\nstrong than the one observed for the tat genes. Moreover, our results show that there is no \n\ninfluence in promoter activity when the tat genes or the lmo0364 were deleted from the \n\ngenome. It might be possible that there is no relation between the presence of the secretion \n\nsystem and the transcription of the operon where the putative secreted protein is coded, \n\nraising the question about what might happen to the transcript of lmo0367 in the tatAC \n\nmutant. Is the mRNA or the protein degraded? Is it possible that the Lmo0367 is secreted \n\nthrough another system or does it accumulates inside the cell? These questions can only be \n\nanswered by performing a more detailed study on the protein Lmo0367. \n\nSimilarly to what has been shown to tatAC genes by Ledala et al. (40), the lmo0365-67 \n\noperon is also under the negative regulation of Fur. The fur gene has been shown to be \n\nexpressed in the presence of iron and significantly repressed in the absence of the same \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nmetal (40). However the transcriptional in vivo study developed by Camejo et al. (61) showed \n\nthat both fur and lmo0366 were highly upregulated in vivo (61), presenting some \n\ninconsistency in the predicted mechanisms of regulation. It is also interesting to notice that if \n\nfree iron is present in almost negligible concentrations in vivo (57), the fur gene should then \n\nbe repressed or, at least, not upregulated, as it will repress some genes responsible for iron \n\nacquisition (40) (57). This reinforces the hypothesis that the regulation by Fur is far from \n\nbeing understood and that it might be a complex sensor/regulator pathway instead of a \n\nnegative regulation by binding of Fur to a fur box in the promoter region. \n\n \n\n4.3. Transcriptional Regulator Lmo0364 \n\nThe locus from gene lmo0361 to lmo0367 is a conserved locus also present in L. innocua. \n\nGenes lmo0361 and lmo0362 seem to be related to lmo0367, since the first two code for the \n\ntranslocation system responsible for the secretion of the product of the last one. In the same \n\nlocus, gene lmo0364, coding for a transcriptional regulator required further study. Besides its \n\nparticular location, the lmo0364 proved not to be related to the other genes in the locus, as it \n\nis not involved in the transcription regulation of any of the genes studied. Interestingly, L. \n\nmonocytogenes serovar 4b appears to have genes homologous to lmo0363 and lmo0364, \n\nlacking the two operons surrounding these genes.  \n\nConsidering the loss or acquisition of operons lmo0361-62 and lmo0365-67, depending on \n\nthe evolutionary moments of serovar divergence, it is interesting to notice that it happened in \n\ntwo different places, although close to each other. The G+C content in these two loci is \n\nbetween 36 and 41%, similar to the content determined for Listeria species (38%). This may \n\nsuggest their lost at some point along the species divergence. According to Doumith et al. \n\n(62), serovar 1/2a diverged from serovar 4b and L. innocua, being these last two evolutionary \n\ncloser than to the serovar 1/2a. This may indicates that, serovar 4b has lost the genes \n\nlmo0361-62 and lmo0365-67, present in both serovar 1/2a and in L. innocua.  \n\nOur results show that the transcription regulator Lmo0364 did not influence L. \n\nmonocytogenes growth or in vivo virulence, pointing that probably it is not related to key \n\nvirulence genes. Actually, when a protein BLAST (BLASTp, NCBI) was performed, 96% \n\nsimilarity was found between this transcriptional regulator and the DeoR regulator from E. \n\ncoli. The E.coli family of DeoR regulators includes at least 14 members and they usually act \n\nas repressors in sugar metabolism (63). The Lmo0364 could then be related to L. \n\nmonocytogenes sugar metabolism and not to the studied iron related operons. Either way, \n\nwe showed that it might be transcribed when cells are grown in rich medium, since promoter \n\nactivity was reported for lmo0364 for both exponential and stationary phases.   \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\n31 \n \n\n5.

Depending on whether the second \nrecombination event occurs between the two homologous sequences in area A or B, the gene \nwill either remain in the chromosome (area A) or be excised along with the vector (area B). \nGene deletion occurs only if the second recombination event occurs in area B, as shown."}]}}}
