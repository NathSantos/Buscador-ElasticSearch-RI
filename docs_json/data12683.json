Methods: The limnological/water \nquality study was carried out in rainy (March/2007) and dry (September/2007) seasons, \nconsidering 17 sampling stations. Results: Variables such as channel width and depth, \nwater velocity and temperature increased towards the river\u2019s mouth; water transparency, \nvelocity and dissolved oxygen were higher in the upstream regions. Light penetration was \ntotal at most sampling stations and pH was predominantly acid. The sampling stations \nimpacted by pollution sources, Lavap\u00e9s and Araqu\u00e1 Rivers, exhibited higher values \nof electric conductivity, suspended solids, total nitrogen, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, \ntotal dissolved phosphorus, BOD, and thermotolerant coliforms. Higher values of \nelectric conductivity, turbidity and suspended solids were observed in the rainy season, \nwhereas higher chlorophyll concentrations occurred in the dry season. The Lavap\u00e9s \nRiver exhibits the worst environmental condition, while Capivara River is under better \nstate of conservation. This study shows that it is urgent the implementation of measures \nfor preservation and restoration of these regional aquatic ecosystems. All studied rivers \nwere influenced by seasonal variation, sewage discharges and by watershed use and \noccupation. The TSI is a good analysis tool. The studied rivers export organic matter and \nTN, TP and SS loads to Tiet\u00ea and Paranapanema rivers. Conclusions: This study show \nthe importance of river management and that the accelerated degradation of the river \nsystems indicates the little progress of the Brazilian legislation in terms of preservation \nand good management practices and that the interface between science, law, management \nand conservation need to be improved.\n\nKeywords: pollution, CONAMA 357, trophic state index, loads.\n\nResumo: Objetivo: O presente trabalho buscou avaliar, comparativamente, a \ninflu\u00eancia dos distintos tipos de impactos ambientais na bacia hidrogr\u00e1fica sobre os \nrios Capivara, Lavap\u00e9s, Araqu\u00e1 e Pardo, e transfer\u00eancias de efeitos para a jusante. \nM\u00e9todos: O estudo limnol\u00f3gico/qualidade de \u00e1gua foi realizado nos per\u00edodos chuvoso \n(mar\u00e7o/2007) e seco (setembro/2007), sendo consideradas 17 esta\u00e7\u00f5es de amostragem. \nResultados:\u00a0 Vari\u00e1veis como largura, profundidade, vaz\u00e3o e temperatura da \u00e1gua \naumentaram a jusante; velocidade, transpar\u00eancia e oxig\u00eanio dissolvido foram maiores \nnos trechos superiores.

The superficial sediment of freshwater \necosystems is the compartment where intense \ndecomposition of the organic matter and the \nnutrient cycling occur and it is also inhabited by a \ndiversified and numerous benthic fauna (H\u00e5kanson \nand Jansson, 1983; Mozeto\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006).\n\nDespite the growing demand from the Brazilian \nsociety for the maintenance of satisfactor y \nenvironmental standards of the freshwater \necosystems, there is a weak linkage between \nlegislation, practical management and science, with \nmany technical difficulties and lack of appropriate \nframework for classifying rivers according to the \nspecific legislation (Brasil, 2005). It is also important \nto keep as a reference that the eutrophication process \npromotes drastic changes in aquatic ecosystems, \nwhich will be hardly mitigated.\n\nThis investigation aimed: (a) to assess the water \nquality condition of Araqu\u00e1, Capivara, Lavap\u00e9s and \nPardo Rivers by analysis of physical and chemical \nvariables of water and sediment; (b) to assess the \ndownstream impact of medium and small size \nrivers on higher order aquatic systems, in terms \nof transportation of phosphorus, nitrogen and \nsuspended solids loads.\n\n2.

Geographic positioning and general \ncharacteristics of each sampling point are shown \nin Table\u00a01.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe increasing multiple uses of the water \nresources have caused major modifications on \nthe aquatic ecosystems. Nevertheless, it is very \ndifficult to determine precisely the effects of the \nenvironmental impacts due to the human activities, \nas they are continuous and ubiquitous with multiple \ndirect and indirect consequences (Tundisi, 2003; \nAllan, 2004; Heathwaite, 2010).\n\nMedium and small size rivers can be considered \nas highly representative freshwater ecosystem in \nthe State of S\u00e3o Paulo, if considered their wide \ndistribution and high frequency in the local \nand regional landscapes. Due to the differential \npositioning among other Brazilian States, in \nterms of higher economic production and higher \ndemographic density, in addition to the limited \nefficiency of the public environmental conservation \npolicies, a severe degradation of the surface waters \nis widely disseminated in S\u00e3o Paulo State.\n\nThe small rivers flowing in different Brazilian \nbiomes constitute a dense and widespread structural \ncollecting net of all kind of allochthonous material, \nwhich is transported to higher order river systems \n(Tundisi, 2003). In urbanized and in mono-\ncultured areas (e.g. vast sugar-cane plantation) \nthe small rivers transport high loads of nutrient, \nsediments and contaminants, due to the intensive \nuse and occupation of each individual watershed. \nThis process can result in a considerable impact \n(magnification of loads introduction) on larger \nrivers or reservoirs downstream located, as already \nobserved for southeast (Paranapanema River in \nS\u00e3o Paulo State\u00a0-\u00a0Ferrareze\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006) and central \n(savanna-cerrado streams\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 Fonseca\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2014) \nBrazil.\n\nWater physical and chemical characteristics \nare good indicators of the environmental health \nand integrity, as they are key factors determining \nthe ecosystem functioning. Additionally, there \nis also a practical applicability for this kind of \nmeasurements, as they are primarily considered by \n\nem contraste com o rio Capivara em melhor estado de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. Os rios estudados \nforam fortemente influenciados pela varia\u00e7\u00e3o sazonal e por despejos de esgoto e uso e \nocupa\u00e7\u00e3o da bacia hidrogr\u00e1fica. O IET mostrou ser uma boa ferramenta de an\u00e1lise. Os \nrios estudados impactam a jusante com a exporta\u00e7\u00e3o de mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica e cargas elevadas \nde NT, PT e SS para os rios Tiet\u00ea e Paranapanema. Conclus\u00f5es: O estudo mostrou a \nimport\u00e2ncia da gest\u00e3o desses ambientes e que a degrada\u00e7\u00e3o dos rios demonstram que \na legisla\u00e7\u00e3o brasileira avan\u00e7ou pouco na preserva\u00e7\u00e3o, gest\u00e3o e manejo dos ecossistemas \naqu\u00e1ticos e que a interface entre ci\u00eancia, legisla\u00e7\u00e3o, gest\u00e3o e preserva\u00e7\u00e3o de ecossistemas \naqu\u00e1ticos precisa ser melhorada.\n\nPalavras-chave: polui\u00e7\u00e3o, CONAMA 357, \u00edndice de estado tr\u00f3fico, cargas.\n\n\n\n406 Oliveira, PCR., Nogueira, MG. and Sartori, LP.

Results\n\nThe data variance explicability of the principal \ncomponents analysis (PCA) (Figure\u00a0 2) was high, \n54.69% in the axis 1, 14.66% in axis 2. Water \nvariables were mainly related with axis 1, and \nsediment variables with axis 2. The water variables \nbetter correlated with the axis 1 were electric \nconductivity (r=0.72), suspended organic solids \n(r=0.579), chlorophyll-a (r=0.532), total (r=0.668) \nand thermotolerant (r=0.759) coliforms, TN \n(r=0.924) and TP (r=0.9), ammonium (r=0.796), \nnitrite (r=0.869), nitrate (r=0.913), organic \n(r=0.606) and inorganic (r=0.927) dissolved \nphosphorus and total dissolved phosphorus (r=0.93) \nand silicate (r=0,509).

vol. 26, no. 4, p. 404-419   411Differential environmental impacts on small and medium size rivers\u2026\n\nL3, L4 and P3), due to the continuous erosional \nprocess and soil transportation along the basins. \nThe sediment of the other sampling stations was \nclassified as medium sand.\n\nThe organic matter percentage (Table\u00a0 5) and \nnitrogen concentration (Figure\u00a05) in the sediments \nwere influenced by the predominant particle size. \nThus, the stations A5, C4, L3, L4 and P3, with finer \nsediment particles, exhibited higher organic matter \npercentage and nitrogen concentration. There was \nno clear correlation between nitrogen concentration \nin water and sediment.\n\n3.1. The trophic index\n\nThe trophic index\u00a0\u2013\u00a0TSI was also calculated in \nthis study aiming to classify rivers according to their \neutrophication degree (Table\u00a04). Higher values of \nTSI were determined for the sampling station A2, \nconsidered hypereutrophic due to the excessive \nconcentration of chlorophyll-a. The lowest TSI was \ndetermined for P2, considered ultra-oligotrophic, \nwhich may be related to low nutrient availability \nin the water. The TSI was generally higher in dry \nseason with an increase downstream tendency, \nexcept in A2 and P1 directly under influence of \nsewage discharges. Lower TSI was calculated for \nPardo River in the rainy-summer period.\n\n3.2. Loads\n\nHigher loads of TN and TP are transported by \nLavap\u00e9s River and lower by Pardo River (Figure\u00a06). \nNutrient loads were higher in the rainy season, \nexcept for TP in Lavap\u00e9s River that should be \nrelated to sewage concentration in dry season. \n\nLavap\u00e9s River during the dry-winter. The inorganic \nphosphate was lowest in P2 and highest in A2. The \norganic phosphate was lowest in C3 and highest in \nL2. Lavap\u00e9s River had the highest inorganic and \norganic phosphate concentration. Capivara River \nshowed the lowest inorganic and organic phosphate \nconcentrations\n\nTotal and dissolved nutrient concentration were \nhigher in dry period (Table\u00a04). Sampling stations \nwith domestic and industrial sewage impact were \nthe ones with higher nutrient concentration (A2, \nL2, L3, L4 and P1). Lavap\u00e9s River always showed \nhigh nutrient concentration, mainly in the medium \nriver stretch, right after the headwater stretch (L1), \nand concentrations in Capivara River were generally \nlower.\n\nDBO, pH and OD are important water \nvariables that do not show up in PCA analysis. \nThe BOD values were high in Lavap\u00e9s and Araqu\u00e1 \nrivers, especially in the rainy season (Table\u00a03). Acid \nconditions predominated in the studied rivers, \nmainly in dry season (Figure\u00a0 3). In the sampling \nstation L2, with a direct influence of domestic \nsewage discharges, the pH values were high in \nboth periods. Higher concentrations of OD were \nobserved during the dry season, due to a positive \ninfluence of lower temperatures. In summer higher \ndifferences were observed among the rivers mean \nvalues.\n\nConcerning the sediment analysis, some \nupstream stations exhibited consolidated sediment \nlike coarse gravel (A2 and C2) or even a continuous \nrock bed (L2 and P1) (Table\u00a05).

Capivara, with \nhigher percentage of forests in the watershed (47%) \n(Figure\u00a07) is the river with the lowest contribution \nof SS exportation.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nBased on the integrated analysis (PCA) of \ndata, which discriminated the main tendencies of \nvariation, the discussion of the results was organized \nin the following topics: seasonality, longitudinal \nvariation, impacts and management.\n\n4.1. Seasonality\n\nThe rivers width, depth, velocity, flow, suspended \nsolids, electric conductivity, turbidity and BOD \nat the different sampling stations were generally \nhigher in summer/rainy season (Table\u00a06). The rain \neffects on soil material transportation into the \nrivers are amplified by diminution of retention \nmechanisms (low permeability, soil compactness \nand deforestation). Similar results were observed \nby Moretto and Nogueira (2003) in a previous \ncomparative study of Capivara and Lavap\u00e9s rivers.\n\nAccording to Brigante and Esp\u00edndola (2003) \nmost Brazilian rivers are naturally turbid, due to \nthe geological characteristics of the basins and \neffects of the strong tropical rains. Additionally, the \nsuppression of the vegetal coverage, increasing soil \nsusceptibility to erosion, is the most frequent human \nactivity that causes turbidity increases of freshwater \necosystems (P\u00e9rez, 2003).\n\nHigh variation in chlorophyll and dissolved \noxygen concentration between rainy and dry season \nwas also observed (Table\u00a03). The chlorophyll-a and \nDO were higher in dry season, probably because \n\nFor nitrogen the increase between rainy and dry \nperiod was proportionally higher in Araqu\u00e1 River, \n5.3 times. This result is related to sewage impact in \nthe upstream and intensive agricultural land use in \nthe watershed area (63%) (Figure\u00a0 7). Suspended \nsolids were higher in Araqu\u00e1 and Lavap\u00e9s rivers in \nthe rainy season. Lower SS load was calculated for \nPardo River during dry season.\n\nThe rivers Lavap\u00e9s, Capivara and Araqu\u00e1 \ntogether export 27.42 kg.day\u20131 of TP in the rainy \nseason and 21.11 kg.day\u20131 in the dry season. The \nlargest contribution is from Lavap\u00e9s River (63% \nin rainy season and 85% in dry season). The \nconsidered rivers TN exportation is 531.73\u00a0kg.day\u20131 \nin rainy season and 247.05 kg.day\u20131 in dry season, \nwith higher contribution also from Lavap\u00e9s River \n(74% in rainy and 84% in dry season).

P\u00e9rez \n(2003) considers that water nitrogen main sources \nare associated to organic effluents and agriculture \nactivities and nitrite and ammonium indicate recent \ncontamination (organic).\n\nIn Pardo River the loads transportation increase \n6.2 times for TP and 27 times for SS in rainy season \nwhen compared to dry the season. The Lavap\u00e9s, \nCapivara and Araqu\u00e1 rivers loads exportation of TP \nto Tiet\u00ea River were 1.3 times higher in rainy season \nand for TN it was 2.15 higher.\n\nthe diminution of the washout effect, in case of \nchlorophyll-a, and lower temperature, favoring \noxygen solubility.\n\nThe TN, nitrite, nitrate and ammonium \nconcentration in the water increased in dry season, \ndirectly related with water flow decrease and \ndiminution of dilution effect. K\u00f6nig\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2008) \nalso observed higher values of nutrients during \nwinter, in small streams from south Brazil, superior \nthan the values of total phosphorus accepted \nby CONAMA/357 (Brasil, 2005). Phosphates \nconcentration was approximately twice higher in the \ndry season, with the predominance of the organic \nfraction. Similar trend was observed by Gralh\u00f3z and \nNogueira (2006) in a small and heavily polluted \ntributary of Araqu\u00e1 River.\n\nFigure\u00a07.

Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia\n\nA5, L3, L4 and P3). These stations were also \ngrouped in the PCA because of the sediment \norganic matter, NT, PT and grain size (axis 2). The \ndownstream accumulation of fine sediment and \nits negative impact on benthic invertebrates is a \nclear impairment indicative (Buendia\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2013; \nSuriano\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011).\n\nIn streams impacted by sewage effluents (Araqu\u00e1 \nand Lavap\u00e9s) the amount of nutrients is probably \nmuch higher than the biota consumption, and \nphosphorus tends to accumulate downstream \nin the bottom sediment. In streams with no \nsignificant organic sewage discharges (Pardo \nand Capivara) there is an opposite tendency, \nphosphorous concentration in the sediments \ndecreases downstream, probably related to biota \nincorporation. Kuhlmann\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2014) considered \nthat organic pollution and erosion impacts in the \nParaibuna River were buffered by the depuration \nprocess and protective action of the riparian \nvegetation of the surrounding area.\n\n4.3. Impacts\n\nT h e  a n a l y z e d  r i v e r s  u n d e r g o  d i s t i n c t \nenvironmental impacts that are related with point \nand non-point sources impairments, such as urban \nsewage and intensive soil use for agriculture.\n\nThe PCA analysis grouped the river stretches \nunder direct influence of punctual sources of \npollution\u00a0 -\u00a0 Lavap\u00e9s (L2, L3), Araqu\u00e1 (A2) \nand Pardo (P1). It is related with the sewage \ndischarges that promoted the increase of SS, EC, \nchlorophyll-a, total and thermotolerant coliforms, \nTN and TP, ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, organic \nand inorganic dissolved phosphorus and total \ndissolved phosphorus in water, that were water \nvariables better correlated with this axis 1.\n\nIn polluted waters there is a conspicuous \nincrease of conductivity due to the direct effect \nof higher ions concentration (Brigante and \nEsp\u00edndola, 2003; Gralh\u00f3z and Nogueira, 2006; \nLussier\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008). Ternus\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2011) observed \nsignificant conductivity increase in river courses \npassing through urban areas with no marginal \nvegetation. Conductivity also provided to be useful \nto differentiate ecological conditions and correlation \nwith biota (Braun\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Cunha\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; \nMazzoni\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Suriano\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011).\n\nIn sampling sites affected by sewage sources \nthe organic fraction of suspended solids was much \nhigher than the mineral one (e.g. A2 station) as \nobserved by Brigante and Esp\u00edndola (2003) in the \nMogi Gua\u00e7u River and concluded that these results \n\nThe dilution effect is remarkable in rainy season, \nbut the runoff contributes to higher P, N and SS \nloads during this season. Kuhlmann\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2014) \nconsidered that the transport of erosional material \nfrom surface runoff to the upstream section of \nParaibuna and Ipiranga rivers (SP), were positively \ncorrelated with rainfall. Banner\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (2009), \nstudying phosphorus dynamics in streams of \nKansas\u00a0-\u00a0USA, found that 88% of the total annual \nload is transported during flows that occur only in \n10% of the time.\n\n4.2. Longitudinal variation\n\nThe upstream stations exhibited higher velocity, \nwater transparency and dissolved oxygen and also \ngravel substrate. Downstream stations had higher \nwidth, depth and water temperature, fine sediment \nand higher organic matter percentage and nitrogen \nin the sediment. The TSI tend to be lower in \nupstream sampling stations.\n\nThe electric conductivity, suspended solids and \nturbidity have a tendency to increase downstream \nin Capivara and Lavap\u00e9s rivers and the temperature \nand BOD in all studied rivers (Table\u00a03). The PCA \nalso evidenced a better environmental condition \nin the upstream sampling stations (L1, C1 and \nP2). This is a result of longitudinal accumulated \nimpacts from agriculture, deforestation, soil erosion \nand domestic sewage discharges. Dodds and Oakes \n(2008) pointed out the important role of headwater \nriparian areas on the downstream water quality \nmaintenance. The nutrient and sediments loads \nresults demonstrate the impact of small and medium \nsize rivers on higher order rivers and reservoirs \ndownstream located.\n\nIn Araqu\u00e1, Capivara and Lavap\u00e9s rivers \nDO decreased towards the mouth due to the \nturbulence decrease (lower declivity) and increase \nin decomposition processes, higher temperature \nand lentic characteristic due to the influence \nof Barra Bonita reservoir. High increase in \nchlorophyll-a concentration at A5 and L4 stations \nand the reduction of the sediment size in the \nriver mouths stations was influenced by the \nlentic characteristics of Barra Bonita reservoir, \nappropriated to phytoplankton development. In \nLavap\u00e9s river is noteworthy the DO concentration \ndecline in L3 station, after the sewage discharge \n(L2), diminution of the water velocity and the \nreplacement of lotic by lentic characteristics.\n\nStations downstream located, with lower river \ndeclivity, showed higher organic matter percentage \nand nitrogen concentration in the sediment (A4, \n\n\n\n2014, vol. 26, no. 4, p. 404-419   415Differential environmental impacts on small and medium size rivers\u2026\n\npollution, streams siltation, and loss of riparian \nvegetation. In the United States the distinct stream \nsegments in watersheds are classified by criteria of \nthe Department of Agriculture Natural Resources \nConservation Service (NRCS), which is comparable \nto the Brazilian CONAMA, searching for primary \nmanagement capacity in regions of high agricultural \nthreats (Fore\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014).\n\nThe impact related with deforestation and \nerosion was particularly observed in Araqu\u00e1 River \nbasin. As seen in Figure\u00a0 7, the Araqu\u00e1 River has \nonly 12% of the watershed composed by forested \nor reforested areas, and Capivara River has 47%, the \nhighest forest percentage in this study. In our study \nAraqu\u00e1 and Lavap\u00e9s Rivers exhibited higher spatial \nand seasonal amplitude of variation for temperature. \nDifferences in temperature can be related to the \ndistinct proportion of preserved riparian forest \nin each basin (Ternus\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011). Fonseca\u00a0et\u00a0al. \n(2014) consider that the smallest median values \nreported for water temperature from sites classified \nas \u201cnatural\u201d is a consequence of shading effects \npromoted by riparian vegetation.\n\nThe sampling station A2 (Cintra River) showed \nthe highest chlorophyll\u2013a concentration, due to \nthe direct influence of upstream phytoplankton \ninoculums derivate from primary sewage treatment \nlagoons. The survival of the phytoplankton \npopulations along the downstream stretches \ncould be favored by increasing tendency of light \npenetration, as the marginal forest has been \nremoved. Harding\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2006) observed increase \nabout 100 to 600% of periphyton growth in \nimpacted sites of agriculture areas with low riparian \nforest.\n\nThe loads results are related to the characteristic \nof the watershed area as for Pardo River where 50% \nis pasture, 31% agriculture and 14% forest. For \nDodds and Oakes (2008) the land use characteristics \nare the main stressor for water quality variation \namong watersheds. In Araqu\u00e1 and Pardo rivers \nthe runoff impact that carries TN, TP and SS \nfrom the soil to the water is mainly associated \nto the watershed use and occupation and loads, \nespecially of TN, increased in the rainy season. \nSilicate higher concentrations are also associated \nto intensive soil use/deforestation for agriculture, \nas observed by Moretto and Nogueira (2003). \nAccording to Liu\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2014), the losses of P and \nN in farmland plains are positively correlated with \nthe rainfall intensity and the antecedent conditions \nof soil moisture, and negatively correlated with the \n\nreflected the sum of both natural conditions and \nhuman impacts.\n\nNutrient concentration in stream water is too \ndifferent when compared polluted and non-polluted \nconditions (Strieder\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2006; Cunha\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011; \nTernus\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2011). According to Odum (2007) \nhuman occupation accelerated the circulation \nof many earth materials and the auto-regulation \nprocesses, which tend to maintain the ecosystems \nhomeostasis, became less operational, hence the \nnutrients cycles tend to be imperfect or acyclic \nresulting in a paradoxical situation with excess in \nsome places and scarcity in others.\n\nNitrogen availability, especially associated to \nphosphorus, can regulate or limit the productivity \nin freshwater ecosystems (Carmouze, 1994). The \nconcentration of chlorophyll-a in the studied river, \nas showed in the PCA, is positively correlated with \npollution and eutrophication process. According \nto P\u00e9rez (2003) the phosphorus amount is much \nlower comparing to nitrogen, but its effect for \neutrophication is higher. In this study the TP \nconcentration were about eight times lower than \nnitrogen. Cunha\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (2011) consider that TP \npoint discharges from urban centers represent a \nhigher risk of eutrophication for S\u00e3o Paulo State \nrivers than the diffuse sources. The authors also \nfound lower TP concentration in rivers with \npresence of riparian vegetation.\n\nThe loads analyses also showed that high TP, TN \nand SS transported by Lavap\u00e9s River are strongly \nrelated to point sources of pollution. According to \nMoretto and Nogueira (2003) this river receives \nhuge loads of urban sewage, partially treated, just \nafter its headwater.\n\nThe nonpoint source impacts were the ones \nassociated with intensive watershed uses and \noccupation, such as the absence of riparian forest, \nsoil compactness, soil erosion and agriculture \nimpact. Better water quality conditions were \nassociated to Capivara and Pardo rivers, which \nwere grouped in the opposite side of PCA axis 1. \nRegionally these rivers indicate a relatively good \nconservation status. Riparian forests and whole \nwatershed land cover are significantly correlated \nwith the water quality metrics, particularly nutrient \nconcentrations, and the agricultural and/or urban \nlands are the most important predictors of water \nquality degradation (Dodds and Oakes, 2008; \nKuhlmann\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Mazzoni\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014).\n\nFonseca\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2014) consider that agriculture \nand planted pasture have caused major impacts on \nriver watersheds of Cerrado Domain, such as water \n\n\n\n416 Oliveira, PCR., Nogueira, MG. and Sartori, LP. Acta Limnologica Brasiliensia\n\nuses, conservation and restoration of wetlands and \nreduced applications to match crop needs (Allan, \n2004; Carpenter\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 1998; Dodds and Oakes, \n2008; Hoffmann\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2009; Fore\u00a0 et\u00a0 al., 2014; \nKuhlmann\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014; Liu\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014).\n\nThe legislation is also an important management \ninstrument, because it establishes norms and \nstandards to be followed for good practices in water \nuse and conservation (Kuhlmann\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014). The \ninterpretation of particular water variables, such as \nDO and BOD, is commonly made for water supply \nand sewage companies in Brazil, but it can generate \ndeficient interpretations. In this study the DO \nand BOD did not show strong relationship with \npollution, as observed for SS, EC, chlorophyll-a, \ncoliforms, Nitrogen e Phosphorus in water.\n\nThe specific resolution of the Brazilian Council \nfor the Environment, CONAMA 357, that \nconsiders a range of standards can be considered \nan advance for the Brazilian environmental policy. \nIt establishes limits for water variables according to \nthe current and future uses, and classifies freshwater \nsystems in five classes (especial, 1, 2, 3 and 4).\n\nThe results of some studied variables were \nconfronted with the standards of the CONAMA \n357 resolution for class 1, due to its good quality \nand multiple uses possibilities. Maintenance or \nrestoration in order to achieve class 1 condition \nshould be a target for the society distinct sectors.\n\nIn general the OD and turbidity of most sampling \nstations, as well as chlorophyll-a concentration \nexcept at stations A2, A5 and L4 (in summer), \ncould correspond to class 1 river standards. Most \nof pH values were inappropriate. However, it is \nimportant to consider that acid water can be a \nnatural condition (Odum, 2007).\n\nAll BOD values, TP concentrations, TN \nconcentrations in L2, L3 e L4, thermotolerant \ncoliforms in Araqu\u00e1, Lavap\u00e9s and P1 were \nhigher than the permitted to class 1 rivers. \nAccording to Cunha\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (2011), the reference \nstandard for nutrients should be revised, e. g. \nnitrogen concentrations that are naturally low and \nlimiting condition in many tropical watersheds. \nFonseca\u00a0et\u00a0al. (2014) consider that systems classified \nas \u201cvery impacted\u201d in their study presented TP \nvalues lower than the proposed for class 1 rivers.\n\nFrom \u201cClass 1\u201d to \u201cClass 4,\u201d water quality \ndecreases, and upper limits for different water \nvariables are fixed. Lavap\u00e9s River that receives \neffluents discharge is included in class 4. Class \n4 rivers are only intended for navigation and \nlandscape harmony and its quality standards are \n\nvegetation cover. Longer and more intense rainfall \nresulted in a higher loss of N and P.\n\nViolin\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. (2011) consider that pollutant \nconcentrations increase not only due to higher \ninputs from point and non-point sources but also \nas a result of decreased nutrient removal efficiency \nin hydrological disconnected riparian zones and \nstreambeds. Changes in riparian vegetation are \nnotorious in the studied rivers. In case of Araqu\u00e1 \nRiver it is observed only 12% of forested areas in \nthe watershed, with the predominance of pasture, \n19%, and agriculture, 63%.\n\n4.4. Management\n\nThe obtained results can certainly subsidize \nregional environmental policies. Lavap\u00e9s River \nis the most affected by urbanization, followed \nby Araqu\u00e1 River and they are impacted mainly \nby sewage, whose treatment efficiency should be \nurgently improved. The disposal of untreated sewage \ninto rivers is still a common practice in Brazil and \ngenerates large impact downstream.\n\nThe Lavap\u00e9s River passes through the city of \nBotucatu and the population is in contact with \nvery polluted stretches of the river, providing \nan unhealthy environment, taking off aesthetics \nscenarios, preventing the water to be used for \nwater supply, irrigation, fishing and leisure despite \nits great potential. Moreover this study also shows \nthe river exports large amounts of N, P and SS \nto Tiet\u00ea basin, increasing its eutrophication and \nsiltation. Therefore, the Lavap\u00e9s River pollution \nsurpasses municipality borders and impacts cities \ndownstream.\n\nPardo, Araqu\u00e1, Lavap\u00e9s and Capivara rivers are \nimpacted by rural uses of the watershed, mostly \nmonocultures (especially sugar-cane plantation) \nand cattle pastures without proper soil conservation \npractices and native forest preservation.\n\nFor effective management Carpenter\u00a0 et\u00a0 al. \n(1998) consider essential to understand the \nhydrological processes of retention, related to the \nmechanisms of nutrient mobilization and transport. \nIt is important developing a strategic environmental \nassessment that aims to integrate environmental and \nsustainability considerations into strategic decision \nmaking (Bidstrup and Hansen, 2014).\n\nThe P and N soil losses and transport to \nsurface waters by erosion and runoff occurs over \nlarger spatial scales or landscape scale and may be \nreduced by increasing vegetation cover and gallery \nforest, maintaining buffers zones or other passive \nland uses in headwater streams, regulate the land \n\n\n\n2014, vol. 26, no. 4, p. 404-419   417Differential environmental impacts on small and medium size rivers\u2026\n\nsized rivers studied export large amount of NT, TP \nand SS, mainly to the Tiet\u00ea River basin/Barra Bonita \nreservoir. The assessment of Araqu\u00e1, Capivara, \nLavap\u00e9s and Pardo rivers conditions demonstrates \nthat management measures at punctual and \nwatershed levels are urgent and that environmental \nlaw standards should be reconsidered and improved.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank the reviewers for suggestions that \nimproved the manuscript.

According to Ara\u00fajo and Santaella \n(2001), the management concept that domestic and \nindustrial wastewater can be disposed into water \nbodies due to their ability to dilute and degrade the \nwaste and pollutants is primitive and must be more \nintensively fought. The law consideration that a river \ncan receive wastewater with high concentration \nof pollutants is harmful to the society, especially \nconsidering that S\u00e3o Paulo States is presently in \nthe worst water crisis in the history. Therefore, \nall the rivers should have a minimum quality for \nnobler purposes than only navigation and landscape \nharmony.\n\nThe applicability and efficiency limitations of the \nlegislation for management purposes may be related \nto continuous aquatic environment degradation \nas observed in this study. The CONAMA/357 \nResolution seems to be inadequate to different \nenvironmental impacts, not considering regional \ntypologies and not addressing specific ecosystem \nfeatures. This can mask the reality and generates \nfalse interpretations. The study also shows that \nthe CONAMA/357 could be improved, in order \nto consider important variables, such as sediment \nquality, water electric conductivity, the influence \nof ecological process and be more restrictive to \nnitrogen concentration. In case of phosphorus \nit seems to be too restrictive. By assessing the \ngeneral watershed condition and multiple threats, \nmanagement agencies can prioritize conservation \nactions and investments based on the types and \nseverity of the threats, and the degree of primary \nmanagement capacity (Fore\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2014).\n\nIn China environmental protection policies \nhave been implemented to prevent soil erosion \nand nonpoint source pollutions, resulting in a \nconsiderable percentage of change, close to 60%, \nof water flow, sediment, organic N, and organic P \nat watershed level (Ouyang\u00a0et\u00a0al., 2008).\n\nThe establishment of standards should be related \nto scientific knowledge. In Brazil, different from \nsome more advanced experiences (e.g. USA, China \nand the European Union), the interface between \nscience, law, management and conservation of \naquatic ecosystems is still incipient and needs to be \nurgently improved.\n\n5.  Conclusion\n\nThe considered variables permitted to identify \nlongitudinal tendencies, seasonal influences (rainy-\nsummer and dry-winter) and the impact of point \nand non-point sources of pollution.
