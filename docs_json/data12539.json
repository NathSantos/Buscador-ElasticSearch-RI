R. N. ROSA*/**\n\nKey-words: Gold; oxygen fugacity; reduced/oxidized; magnetite/ilmenite series.\n\nAbstract: Gold seems to show contrasting behaviours during magmatic evolution according to the f0 2 of the melts. In more oxidized\nconditions, characterized by the presence of magnetite as the main Fe-Ti oxide, gold content in plutonic rocks decreases with increasing differentiation. On\nthe other hand, in more reduced conditions, characterized by the predominance of ilmenite, gold content in plutonic rocks increases with increasing\n\ndifferentiation.\nThe mineral structures of the intervening minerals (magnetite and ilmenite) are compared with the possible different gold ions (aurous, Aut;\n\nand auric, Au 3+). It is hypothesized that under more oxidizing conditions auric gold is present, which is easily incorporated in the crystallizing\nmagnetite due to its similar size to ferrous and, to a lesser degree, ferric iron; magnetite effectively acting as a sink for the gold and causing its early\nremoval from the melt. Under more reducing conditions, aurous gold is the only gold cation present and its larger size prevents it from being incor-\nporated into the ilmenite (and possibly magnetite). Therefore gold behaves as an incompatible element and tends to concentrate into the late fluids,\n\npossibly leading to gold mineralization related to highly evolved fluids.\n\nPalavras-chave: ouro; fugacidade do oxigenio; reduzido/oxidado; series da ilmenite e da magnetite .\n\nResumo: \u00b0ouro apresenta comportamento distinto ao longo da evolucao magmatica, de acordo com a f02 do magma .

(1997 ).\n\nFig. 1 - Fe20iFeO ratio vs. alkalinity index plot, showing that gold\nassociated plutons (crosses) are more reduced (F~OiFeO\n<0.5) than gold devoid plutons (circles). Data from North\nAmerican plutons, modified after McC oy et ai. (1997 ).\n\nWork by McCoy et at. (1997) on North American\nplutons, has shown that the association of plutonic related\ngold mineralization with ilmenite-series plutons is due to\nthe incompatible behavior of gold in ilmenite-series\nmagmas. These authors have compared the gold content\n\n, along the differentiation trend for gold favorable plutons\n(where gold mineralization is known to be present) and\nfor gold devoid plutons (where gold mineralization is\nabsent). The contrasting trends are shown in Fig . 2. Gold\ncorrelates positively with silica in ilmenite-series plutons\nand correlates negatively with silica in magnetite-series\nplutons .\n\nMETALLOGENETIC IMPLICATIONS\nOF (0 2 OF MAGMAS\n\nbeing the dominant one. The primary ratio Fe203IFeO\ncan be used as a parameter to distinguish the two series,\nif it is higher than 0.5 a rock can be classified as belonging\nto the magnetite series while if it is lower than 0.5 it can\nbe classified as belonging to the ilmeni te-series. Due to\nthe different opaque mineralogy, plutons can also be\nclassified based on their magnetic susceptibility.\n\nAccording to ISHIHARA (1981) these two distinct\ngranitoid series have substantially different origins and\nmodes of emplacement and thereby their distribution in\ntime and space is quite distinct. Magnetite-series\nplutons are generally originated at greater depths than\nilmenite-series plutons. Additionally, magnetite-series\nplutons broadly correlate with I-type granites (igneous\nsource rock) while ilmenite-series plutons broadly\ncorrelate with S-type granites (sedimentary source rock) .\nTheir distinct oxygen fugacity is related to the dissocia-\ntion of water that acts as an oxidizing agent for magnetite\nseries magmas or to the incorporation of crustal carbon\nthat acts as a reducing agent for the ilmenite-series\nmagmas. To prove the occurrence of carbon incorporation,\nISHIHARA &amp; TERASHIMA (1989) have analyzed granitoids\nfor non-carbonate carbon, hereby showing that carbon\ncontent is appreciably higher in the ilmenite-series than\nin the magnetite-series granitoids .\n\nFrom the metallogenetic point of view, ISHIHARA et\nat. (1985) have shown that f0 2 significantly affects the\ngold con tent of granitoid rocks. In their study, based\non granitoid plutons from Japan, they concluded that\nthe average gold content of the magnetite-series rocks\n(4.3ppm) is almost double that of rocks of the ilme-\nnite -series (2.5ppm). This may be interpreted as being\nthe result of compatible behavior of gold in magnetite-\nseries magmas, in contrast to a possible incompatible\nbehavior of gold in ilmenite-series magmas.\n\nAs an obvious result of this interpretation, several\nauthors have noticed the tendency of plutonic-related\ngold mineralization to be related to more reduced\nmagmatic plutons, belonging to the ilmenite-series.\nLEVEILLE et at. (1988) and later McCoY et at. (1997)\nhave shown this empirical relationship by plotting\ncomposition data for both gold associated and gold devoid\nplutons from Alaska, Idaho and Montana (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nThe incompatible behaviour of gold in reduced magmas: a working hypothesis 77\n\nThe enrichment in gold along differentiation trend for\nthe studied ilmenite-series plutons is in contrast with what\nwas generally thought to happen during magmatic evolu-\ntion (TILLING et al, 1973). However, KOROBEYNIKOV\n(1980) has already referred the tendency for gold accumu-\nlation in accessory minerals of late differentiates of some\nplutons, suggesting that it could behave incompatibly and\nconcentrate in residual melts and fluids.\n\nWORKING HYPOTHESIS\n\nAlthough the gold content from the magma source\nrock might significantly affect the gold content of the\nmagma and ultimately control the presence of mineraliza -\ntion, it is obvious that the magma evolution process will\nplay an even more important role. In this paper, only the\nmagma evolution process is addressed and it is assumed\nthat some gold is present in the magma since the begin-\nning, which does not necessarily have to be always exact.\n\nIt is assumed that the evolution of the magmas related\nto the intrusion-related Au deposits described is essen-\ntially controlled by fractional crystallization. In this case,\nthe empirical observations described above are certainly\ndue to the fact that reduced magma (ilmenite-series)\ninhibits the incorporation of gold into crystallizing\nphases and resulting plutonic rocks. This will promote\ngold concentration in the latter stages of differentiation\nand ultimately allowing the highly evolved fluids to act\nas mineralizing hydrothermal fluids.\n\nThe reason for this contrasting behaviour must be\nassociated with the structure of the minerals that form in\nthe two different magma series, their available cation\nsites and/or with the dominant gold species present under\ndifferent f02 conditions. The radii of the cations\ninvolved are shown in Table 2.\n\nTABLE 2\n\nCation radii\n\nCation: Fe2+(ferrous) Fe 3+(ferric) Au+(aurous) Au 3+(auric)\n\nRadii (A) : 0.92 0.785\n1.46-1.49 0.910\n\nDATA FROM SHANNON &amp; PREWITT (1969)\n\nFrom the analysis of the cation radii, the factor that\nmost affects their distribution into mineral phases, it is\napparent that Au3+ is very similar to Fe2+ and therefore\nmight substitute for it. Applying Paulings' 1st rule:\n\nAu\n3\n+ Rcation/Ranion = 0.910/1.26=0.722 } 6 \" Id d\"\n\n-10 coor matron\nFe2+ RcationlRanion = 0.92/1.26=0.730\n\nAu\" RcationlRanion = 1.46/1.26=1.159 12-fold coordination\n\nIt is evident, from the above, that Au3+ can substitute\nfor Fe2+ in 6-fold coordination positions of the magnetite\nand ilmenite structures, which is not possible in the case of\nAu\" because no 12-fold coordination positions are avai-\nlable in these minerals.\n\nIt might therefore be concluded that it is not the\ncrystallizing oxide mineral that controls the incompatible\nbehaviour of gold, but rather the gold species present.\n\nAlthough never dominant under typical magmatic\nconditions, minor amounts of Au3+ might be present\nunder relatively oxidizing conditions, characteristic of\nmagnetite-series magmas (ROMBERGER, pers. comm.)\nTherefore, it is proposed that in magnetite-series\nmagmas , this available Au3+ will readily fit into the Fe 2+\nsite of magnetite, or eventually into the Fe3+ site if a\ncoupled substitution is to be avoided. It is for this reason\n\n.that magnet ite of granitoid rocks has been reported to\ncontain up to I ppm Au (LEVEILLE et al, 1988) .\nSupporting this, work by MIRONOV &amp; ZHMODIK (1980)\nusing gold radioisotopes established that gold enters the\nlattice of magnetite, as well as the lattice of some\nsulfides . Furthermore, as Au3+ gets incorporated into the\ncrystallizing magnetite it promotes the oxidation of Au\"\nto Au3+ so that, if this happens for a long enough period\nof time, all the gold will end up in magnetite. This model\nassumes that species equilibration is more rapid than\nmineral growth and diffusion . In this way, gold will not\nbe available to concentrate in residual fluids that could\nlead to mineralization.\n\nOn the other hand, under more reduced conditions\n(characteristic of ilmenite-series magmas), the only gold\nion present will be Au+, with its large size preventing its\nincorporation into any of the oxide minerals or possibly\nsulfides. The preference of gold for establishing covalent\nbondings will also prevent it from being incorporated\ninto ionic cation sites, even if their size is adequate, as\nwould be the case for replacing K+ in biotite or K-\n-feldspar. This will promote the concentration of gold\ninto highly evolved magmatic fluids, ultimately leading\nto mineralization.\n\nAs proposed, gold speciation is intimately related\nto the oxidation state of the magma, whereby f0 2\neffectively controls the behaviour of gold. NECRASOV\n(1996) compared the speciation of gold with the activity\n\n\n\n78\n\nratios of Fe3+ and Fe2+. Thi s author refers to a work by\nLETNlKOV &amp; VILOR (1981) that demon strated that the\nincrem ent of the activity of Fe2+ (reduction) tend s to\nstabilize Au\" while the increment in the activity of Fe3+\n(oxidation) will promot e the stabilization of Au3+.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH OXIDATION STATE\nRELATIONSHIPS IN BASIC MAGMAS\n(C ARMICHAE L &amp; GHIORSO, 1986)\n\nAs CARMICHAEL &amp; GHIORSO (1986) have not iced ,\nmelts tend to evol ve alo ng paths with constant\nFe203 /FeO as fractionati on proceed s. Since Fe2+, rathe r\nthan Fe3+, tends to be used up earl y (in olivine and\npyroxenes) one would expect that the melt' s oxidation\nstate would increase. The authors' explanation for this\nconsiders that the iron redox system is coupled with the\nsulfur redox system that will act as a self-regulating inter-\nnal oxygen reservoir, thereby constraining the evolving\nmelt to a constant Fe20 3IFeO by means of the reaction:\n\nGold may be involved in a similar coupling of redox\nsystems allowing the gold in the melt to oxidize as auric\ngold is being incorporated into crystallizing phases.\n\nREMARKS\n\nAs a concluding remark it should be referred that\nHEDENQUIST &amp; LOWENSTERN (1994) consider that\npyrrhotite constitutes a common pheno cryst host for gold\nin granites . Thi s is supported by the radioisotope work by\nMIRONOV &amp; ZHMODIK (1980), described earlier.\n\nTherefore, it should be pointed out that for gold to\nbehave as an incompatible element, besides the relatively\nreduced nature of the magma, it might be important that its\nsulfur content is low enough so that no sulfides crystallize,\nsince sulfides (namely pyrrhotite and chalcopyrite) act as\nsinks for gold, even more effectively than magnetite .\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND EXPLORATION\nIMPLICATIONS\n\nThe empiri cal data presented indicates that gold\nbehaves incompatibly only if magma s are sufficiently\n\nD. ROSA\n\nreduced (ilmenite-series magmas). This is caused by the\nlarge size of the only gold cation present under these\nconditi ons (Au\" ) that prevents it from being incorporated\ninto the crystallizing oxides and, poss ibly, sulfides.\n\nThi s has major implication s in the explorati on of\nplutonic- related gold deposits since the metallo genetic\nmodel for this type of deposits implies that gold has to\nbehave incompatibl y, thereby exclud ing magnetit e-series\nplutons as adequate targets. Explorat ion efforts should\ntherefore be focused on ilmenite-series pluton s.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nCARMICHAEL, I. S. E. &amp; GHIORSO, M. S.
