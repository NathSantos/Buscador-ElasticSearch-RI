Uma das estrat\u00e9gias mais predominantes em\nengenharia de tecidos envolve crescimento celular sobre matrizes de\nsuporte (scaffolds), biocompat\u00edveis e biodegrad\u00e1veis. Estas matrizes\ndevem possuir n\u00e3o s\u00f3 elevadas propriedades mec\u00e2nicas e vasculares,\nmas tamb\u00e9m uma elevada porosidade.

A previs\u00e3o real das\npropriedades mec\u00e2nicas, vasculares e topol\u00f3gicas das matrizes de\nsuporte, produzidas por t\u00e9cnicas de biofabrica\u00e7\u00e3o, \u00e9 muito importante\npara as diversas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em engenharia de tecidos. \nA presente disserta\u00e7\u00e3o apresenta o estado da arte da engenharia de\ntecidos, bem como as t\u00e9cnicas de biofabrica\u00e7\u00e3o envolvidas na\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de matrizes de suporte. Para o design optimizado de matrizes\nde suporte foi adoptada uma metodologia de design baseada tanto em\nm\u00e9todos de elementos finitos para o c\u00e1lculo do comportamento\nmec\u00e2nico, vascular e as optimiza\u00e7\u00f5es topol\u00f3gicas, como em m\u00e9todos\nanal\u00edticos para a valida\u00e7\u00e3o das simula\u00e7\u00f5es estruturais utilizando dados\nexperimentais. Considerando que as matrizes de suporte s\u00e3o estruturas\nelementares do tipo LEGO, dois tipos de fam\u00edlias foram consideradas,\nsuperf\u00edcies n\u00e3o peri\u00f3dicas e as superf\u00edcies triplas peri\u00f3dicas que\ndescrevem superf\u00edcies naturais. Os objectivos principais desta\ndisserta\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o: i) avaliar as t\u00e9cnicas existentes de engenharia de\ntecidos; ii) avaliar as t\u00e9cnicas existentes de biofabrica\u00e7\u00e3o para a\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de matrizes de suporte; iii) avaliar o desempenho e\ncomportamento das matrizes de suporte; iv) implementar uma\nmetodologia de design de matrizes de suporte em vari\u00e1veis tais como a\nporosidade, geometria e comportamento mec\u00e2nico e vascular por forma\na auxiliar o processo de design; e por fim, v) validar experimentalmente\na metodologia adoptada. \n \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \n\nkeywords Tissue Engineering, Scaffolds, Biofabrication, Numerical Simulation,\nMechanical Behaviour, vascular Behaviour, Topological Optimization. \n\nabstract The design of optimized scaffolds for tissue engineering is a key topic of\nresearch, as the complex macro- and micro- architectures required for a\nscaffold depends not only on the mechanical properties, but also on the\nphysical and molecular queues of the surrounding tissue within the\ndefect site. Thus, the prediction of optimal features for tissue\nengineering scaffolds is very important for its mechanical, vascular or\ntopological properties. \nThe relationship between high scaffold porosity and high mechanical\nproperties is contradictory, as it becomes even more complex due to the\nscaffold degradation process. A scaffold design strategy was developed,\nbased on the finite element method, to optimise the scaffold design\nregarding the mechanical and vascular properties as a function of\nporosity. Scaffolds can be considered as a LEGO structure formed by\nan association of small elementary units or blocks. In this research\nwork, two types of family elementary scaffold units were considered:\nnon-triple periodic minimal surfaces and triple periodic minimal surfaces\nthat describe natural existing surfaces. The main objectives of this\nresearch work are: i) The evaluation of the Tissue Engineering\nmethodology and its different strategies; ii) The evaluation of the\nexisting biofabrication technologies used to produce tissue engineering\nscaffolds; iii) The evaluation of the scaffold\u2019s requirements involved in\nthe scaffold\u2019s design; iv) The development of an integrated design\nstrategy based on material, porosity, geometry, mechanical and\nvascular properties, in order to aid the scaffold design process; and v)\nThe experimental validation of the adopted design strategy. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\ni\n \n\n \n\nIndex \n\n \n\nIndex ..................................................................................................................................................... i \n\nFigure Index ........................................................................................................................................ iii \n\nTable Index ......................................................................................................................................... xi \n\nChapter 1 \u2013 Introduction ..................................................................................................................... 1 \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n1.1. Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\nSince the early years of mankind\u2019s existence, the regeneration of tissues and \n\norgans has been an issue of dreams, as well as relevant domain for ancient Greek \n\nMythology (Dougherty, 2006). According to the Mythology, Prometheus, a Greek \n\nTitan, disobeyed a direct order from the God Zeus, and for that reason \n\nPrometheus was chained to a rock in the Caucasus Mountains where his torture \n\nshould take place. Every day, a great eagle would come to Prometheus and eat \n\nhis liver, leaving only at nightfall when the liver would begin to grow back once \n\nmore (Figure 1.1). At daybreak, the eagle would return to the chained Prometheus \n\nand again attack his body, eating his liver. The daily ritual would repeat itself into \n\neternity, or until Zeus decided to relieve Prometheus from his punishment. This \n\nmyth clearly identifies that even in ancient Greece, man wanted to restore tissues \n\nand organs, which was also reflected on the understanding they had on the ability \n\nof specific tissues to regenerate. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Illustration of Prometheus punishment by Christian Schussele (1824-1879). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\n \n\nToday, its incidence in modern medicine is growing with the ageing of the \n\npopulation and higher expectations for a better quality of life, together with the \n\nincreasing number of required implants and organ shortage. The loss or failure of \n\nan organ or tissue is a frequent, devastating, and costly problem in health care. \n\nCurrently, this problem is treated either by transplanting organs from one individual \n\nto another or performing surgical reconstructions, transferring tissue from one \n\nlocation in the human body into the diseased site. The need for substitutes to \n\nreplace or repair tissues or organs due to disease, trauma, or congenital problems \n\nis overwhelming. Tissue engineering (Figure 1.2) emerged to overcome these \n\nlimitations by creating cell-based substitutes of native tissues (Risbud, 2001; \n\nLanger and Vacanti, 1993). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Tissue Regeneration Process System involving several steps and advanced \n\ntechnologies (http://ims.postech.ac.kr). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n3\n \n\nTissue engineering is a multidisciplinary field focusing on the use of cells and \n\nengineered materials (Figure 1.3), combining the principles of biology, engineering \n\nand medicine to create biological substitutes for lost or defective native tissues \n\n(Eshraghi and Das, 2010; B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2009a; 2009b; 2008; Gibson, 2005; Tan et \n\nal, 2005; Vozzi et al, 2003; Risbud, 2001). According to Skalak and Fox (1988), \n\ntissue engineering can be described as \u201cthe application of the principles and \n\nmethods of engineering and life sciences toward the fundamental understanding of \n\nstructure-function relationships in normal and pathological mammalian tissues and \n\nthe development of biological substitutes to restore, maintain, or improve tissue \n\nand organ functions\u201d (B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2008). This new research domain emerged as \n\na rapidly expanding approach to address the organ shortage problem and \n\ncomprises tissue regeneration, organ substitution and gene therapy (Table 1.1). \n\nDiseases, such as Parkinson, Alzheimer, osteoporosis, spine injuries or cancer, \n\nmight in the near future be treated with methods aiming at regenerating diseased \n\nor damaged tissues. An historical overview of this field can be found in a report \n\npublished by the National Science Foundation (2003) of the United States of \n\nAmerica (USA). Recently, de Bartolo et al (2012) presented a vision of the future \n\nof this medical domain in 2030. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Multidisciplinary nature of the tissue engineering field. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\nTable 1.1 \u2013 Main areas of Tissue engineering, adapted from: Kuppan et al (2012) and Jeong et al \n\n(2007) and Tabata (2001). \n\n Purpose Techniques/methodology \n\nTissue \nregeneration \n\nIn vitro production of tissue constructs Cell scaffolding, bioreactor, microgravity \n\nIn vivo natural healing process Cell scaffolding, controlled release, physical barrier \n\nIschemia therapy Angiogenesis \n\nOrgan \nsubstitution \n\nImmunoisolation Biological barrier \n\nNutrition and oxygen supply Angiogenesis \n\nTemporary assistance for organ function Extracorporeal system \n\nGene \nTherapy \n\nInhibiting induction of a specific gene, or by \nediting undesirable genomic mutations. \n\nIntracellular transfer of nucleic acid drugs to \nmodulate cellular functions and responses by \n\nexpressing exogenous proteins \n\n \n\nThree general strategies, illustrated in Figure 1.4, were adopted by several \n\nauthors, such as: Bhumiratana and Vunjak-Novakovic (2012), Norrotte et al \n\n(2009), B\u00e1rtolo et al (2008), Matsumoto and Mooney (2006), Mistry and Mikos, \n\n(2005), Fuchs et al (2001), Langer (1997) and Langer and Vacanti (1993) for the \n\ncreation of new tissues: \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 \u2013 Key strategies for engineering personalized bone grafts (Bhumiratana and Vunjak-\n\nsectionNovakovic, 2012). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n5\n \n\n1. Cell-based strategies, involves the direct in vivo implantation of isolated \n\ncells or cell substitutes and it is based on cells synthesizing their own \n\nextracellular matrix (ECM). This approach avoids surgery complications \n\nallowing replacing only the damaged cells required for a specific function. \n\nThe main limitations include immunological rejection and failure of the \n\nencapsulated cells. \n\n \n\n2. Growth-factor-based strategies, based on the use of growth factors and \n\ncontrolled-released systems. Growth factors are proteins secreted by \n\nseveral cell types functioning as signalling molecules, promoting cell \n\nadhesion, proliferation, migration and differentiation (Tessmar and \n\nGopferich, 2007; Boontheekul and Mooney, 2003; Rose and Oreffo, 2002). \n\nThe success of this strategy depends on the growth factors and controlled \n\nreleased systems. Relevant growth factors for bone regeneration and \n\nwound healing applications are indicated in Table 1.2. \n\n \n\nTable 1.2 \u2013 Relevant growth factors for tissue engineering applications, adapted from Tessmar and \n\nGopferich (2007), Boontheekul and Mooney (2003) and Rose and Oreffo (2002). \n\nBone Regeneration \n\nGrowth Factor Relevant activities \n\nTransforming growth factor-?

Scaffold-based methods, based on the use of a temporary scaffold, \n\nprovide a substrate for the implanted cells and a physical support for tissue \n\nformation in an organized way. In this approach, transplanted cells adhere \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nto the scaffold, proliferate, secrete their own ECM and stimulate new tissue \n\nformation. This strategy involves either a closed or an open system. In a \n\nclosed system, cells are isolated from the body by a permeable membrane \n\nthat allows exchange of nutrients and wastes, and protects cells from the \n\nimmune response of the body. An open system begins with the in vitro \n\nculture of cells, which are then seeded onto a scaffold. The cell-matrix \n\nconstruct is then implanted into the body. \n\n \n\nThe cell-seeded temporary scaffold approach is the most widely used strategy for \n\ntissue engineering (Fuchs et al, 2001). In this approach, living cells are obtained \n\nfrom a tissue harvest, from either the patient (auto-graft) or a different person \n\n(allograft), and cultured in vitro on a three-dimensional biodegradable scaffold to \n\nobtain a tissue construct suitable for transplantation (Liu and Czernuszka, 2006). \n\nScaffolds provide an initial biochemical substrate so that the novel tissue can grow \n\nuntil cells produce their own ECM. Therefore, scaffolds not only define the 3D \n\nspace for the formation of new tissues, but also serve as temporary skeletons to \n\naccommodate and stimulate new tissue growth with appropriate functions (B\u00e1rtolo \n\net al, 2012). This cell-seeded temporary scaffold approach is illustrated in Figure \n\n1.5. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5 \u2013 Tissue engineering process involving the cell seeding on scaffolds, in vitro culturing \n\nand patient implantation, adapted from B\u00e1rtolo et al (2012) and Liu and Czernuszka (2006). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n7\n \n\n1.1.1. Cells \n\n \n\nTherapeutic strategies in tissue engineering involve: \n\n \n\n? cellular implantation where cells, derived from an endogenous source \n\nin the patient or a donor, are either injected into the damaged tissue or \n\ncombined in vitro with a degradable scaffold, and then implanted; \n\n? tissue regeneration where a scaffold is implanted directly into the \n\ndamaged tissue, stimulates the cells to promote local tissue repair. \n\n \n\nCells used in tissue engineering may be allogeneic, xenogeneic, syngeneic or \n\nautologous (Fuchs et al, 2001). They should be non-immunogenic, highly \n\nproliferate, easy to harvest, with a high capacity to differentiate into a variety of cell \n\ntypes of specialised functions (Fuchs et al, 2001; Marler et al, 1998). Skeletal \n\nmuscle satellite cells, cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, osteoblasts \n\nand chondrocytes were used in many tissue engineering applications. An ideal cell \n\nsource for tissue engineering should have the capacity to proliferate and then \n\ndifferentiate in vitro, in a manner that can be reproducibly controlled. \n\n \n\nThe growth and differentiation of many cell types is regulated by four major \n\nsources of external signalling (Santos et al, 2012), as shown in Figure 1.6: \n\n \n\n1. Soluble growth and differentiation factors; \n\n2. Nature and organization of insoluble and soluble ECM constituents; \n\n3. Intercellular interactions; \n\n4. Environmental stress induced by fluid flow and/or mechanical stimuli, as \n\nwell other physical cues (oxygen, tension, pH effects). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 \u2013 Mesenchymal stem cells differentiation process in response to cues from the cellular \n\nenvironment (Nikovits and Stockdale, 2007). \n\n \n\n1.1.2. Scaffolds \n\n \n\nAccording to Feder-Mengus et al (2008), scaffolds are a porous 3D cell culture \n\nsubstrates, which provides a temporary template for cell organization into tissue \n\nstructures, both in vitro and in vivo, as they serve some of the following purposes \n\n(Billiet et al, 2012; Truscello et al, 2012; Guillotin and Guillemot, 2011; B\u00e1rtolo et \n\nal, 2009a; 2009b; 2008; Tan and Teoh, 2007; Liu and Czernuszka, 2006; Kreke et \n\nal, 2005; Gomes and Reis, 2004; Gross and Rodriguez-Lorenzo, 2004; Leong et \n\nal, 2003; Kreeger and Shea, 2002; Hutmacher, 2001; Kim and Mooney, 2001; \n\nLanger and Vacanti, 1993): \n\n \n\n? Serve as an adhesion substrate for cells, allowing cell attachment, \n\nproliferation and differentiation; \n\n? Deliver and retain cells and growth factors; \n\n? Enable diffusion of cell nutrients and oxygen; \n\n? Provide temporary mechanical and biological environment to the newly \n\ngrown tissue enabling tissue regeneration in an organised way. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n9\n \n\nAn ideal scaffold must satisfy some biological and physical requirements as \n\nindicated in Table 1.3 (B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2012; Billiet et al, 2012; Reverchon and \n\nCardea, 2012; Vasanthan et al, 2012; B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2009a; 2009b; 2008; Sanz-\n\nHerrera et al, 2009; Leong et al, 2008). Such properties affect not only cell \n\nsurvival, signalling, growth, propagation and reorganization, influencing also cell \n\nshape modelling and gene expressions (Chen et al, 1997; Mooney et al, 1992). \n\n \n\nTable 1.3 \u2013 Relationship between scaffold characteristics and the corresponding biological effect \n\n(Mahajan, 2005). \n\nScaffold characteristics Biological effect \n\nBiocompatibility Cell viability and tissue response \n\nBiodegradability Aids tissue remodelling \n\nPorosity Cell migration inside the scaffold - Vascularisation \n\nChemical properties of the material \nAids in cell attachment and signalling in cell \n\nenvironment \nAllows release of bioactive substances \n\nMechanical properties \nAffects cell growth and proliferation response \n\nIn-vivo load bearing capacity \n\n \n\na) Biological requirements \n\n \n\n? Biocompatibility is related to the acceptance of an implant by both the \n\nsurrounding tissues and the whole body. The implant should be \n\ncompatible with these tissues in terms of mechanical, chemical, surface \n\nand pharmacological properties (Ramakrishna et al, 2001; Angelova and \n\nHunkeler, 1999). Biocompatibility is also related to the ability of the \n\nimplant material to perform an appropriate host response in a specific \n\napplication (Ramakrishna et al, 2001; Angelova and Hunkeler, 1999). \n\nIn tissue engineering, materials should interact positively with the cells, \n\nallowing cell attachment, proliferation, differentiation and host \n\nenvironment, without eliciting adverse host tissue responses (Kim et al, \n\n2003b). \n\n \n\n? Controlled Degradation Rate \u2013 the degradation rate of the scaffold must \n\nbe adjustable in order to match the rate of tissue regeneration. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\n? Biodegradability \u2013 Scaffolds must degrade into non-toxic products with a \n\ncontrolled degradation rate matching the regeneration rate of the native \n\ntissue. The in vivo degradation process of polymeric scaffolds is \n\ninfluenced by different and often conflicting variables, such as those \n\nrelated to the material\u2019s structure (i.e., chemical composition, molecular \n\nweight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, morphology, etc.), \n\nits macroscopic features (i.e., implant shape or size, porous shape, size \n\nand interconnectivity, etc.) and the environmental conditions (i.e., \n\ntemperature, pH of the medium, presence of enzymes or cells and \n\ntissues). The chemical degradation of polymers can mainly proceed \n\neither via degradation by biological agents (enzymes), or hydrolytic \n\ndegradation (hydrolysis) mediated by water, or a combination of both \n\neffects (Figure 1.7) (Ferreira, 2011). Other degradation processes are \n\nattributed to other agents, such as super oxides, phagocytic attack or \n\neven mechanical stress. \n\n \n\na)  \n\nb)  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n11\n \n\nFigure 1.7 \u2013 SEM images of PCL scaffolds a) before and b) after 25 days of the degradation \n\nprocess (Ferreira, 2011). \n\n \n\n? Bioactive \u2013 Scaffolds should be bioactive, promoting and guiding cell \n\nproliferation, differentiation and tissue growth. This bioactivity can be \n\nachieved by adding growth factors and functionalizing the scaffold with \n\nproteins or adhesion-specific peptide sequences, which often resembles \n\nthe ECM providing appropriate biomolecular signals to the cells (Wei et \n\nal, 2007; Nathan and Sporn, 1991). \n\n \n\n? Appropriate porosity, pore size and pore shape \u2013 Generally, a high level \n\nof porosity is required (> 90%) because it increases the surface area, \n\nenabling high cell seeding efficiency, migration and proliferation and \n\nneovascularisation (Sun et al, 2007; Chong and Chang, 2006; \n\nBeckstead et al, 2005; Karageorgiou and Kaplan, 2005; Miot et al, 2005; \n\nWoodfield et al, 2005; Martin et al, 2004; Sun et al, 2004a; 2004b; \n\nTaguchi et al, 2004; Salem et al, 2002; Sherwood et al, 2002; Freyman \n\net al, 2001; Zeltinger et al, 2001; Kuboki et al, 1998; Nehrer et al, 1997; \n\nLeGeros and LeGeros, 1995; Whang et al, 1995). Pore size plays also \n\nan important role in terms of cell adhesion/migration, vascularisation and \n\nnew tissue ingrowth (B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2009a; 2009b; Jones et al, 2009; Lee \n\net al, 2008; Leong et al, 2008; B\u00e1rtolo et al; 2008; Rouwkema et al, \n\n2008; O\u2019Brien et al, 2005; Hollister et al, 2002). Macro-pores (i.e. >50 \n\n\u00b5m) are of an appropriate scale to influence tissue function, while micro-\n\npores (i.e.&lt;50 \u00b5m) influence cell function (e.g. cell attachment), as \n\nmammalian cells typically have 10-20 \u00b5m in size. Smaller pores \n\nenhance cell adhesion and differentiation in vitro, while bigger pores \n\npromote higher cell adhesion, viability and vascularisation in vivo. If the \n\npores are too large, cells will fail to migrate and form networks \n\nthroughout the scaffold. When the pores are too small, its occlusion by \n\ncells will prevent cellular penetration and matrix elaboration within the \n\nscaffolds (Rout et al, 1988). Pore interconnectivity (a 100% \n\ninterconnected network of internal channels is required) is also a critical \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nparameter in terms of cell viability and tissue regeneration. The degree \n\nof pore interconnectivity directly affects the diffusion of physiological \n\nnutrients and gases, as well the removal of metabolic waste and by-\n\nproducts from cells that penetrated into the scaffold (Mikos et al, 1993; \n\nVacanti et al, 1988). Table 1.4 presents the ideal scaffold pore sizes for \n\ndifferent cell types. \n\n \n\nTable 1.4 \u2013 Ideal scaffold pore sizes for different cell types. \n\nCell Types Cell Size [\u00b5m] Ideal Pore Diameter [\u00b5m] \n\nHepatocytes 20-40 (Galarneau et al, 2007) 20 (Yang et al, 2001) \n\nFibroblast 20-50 (Salem et al, 2002) 90-360 (Wang et al, 2005) \n\nBone 20-30 (Oota et al, 2006) 100-350 (Yang et al, 2001) \n\n \n\nb) Mechanical and physical requirements \n\n \n\n? Mechanical Strength \u2013 Scaffolds are required to withstand both in vitro \n\nmanipulation and stresses in the host tissue environment (Bignon et al, \n\n2003; Leong et al, 2003; Prendergast and Meulen, 2001; Temenoff and \n\nMikos, 2000; Brekke, 1996). In vitro, engineered culture tissue \n\nconstructs should maintain their mechanical properties to preserve the \n\nrequired space for cell growth and matrix formation. For in vivo \n\napplications, it is important that scaffolds mimic as closely as possible \n\nthe mechanical properties of the native tissue in order to provide a \n\ntemporary mechanical support for tissue regeneration, providing \n\nstructural stability to the injured site. Initially, the scaffold must withstand \n\nall stresses and loads in the host tissue environment, before gradually \n\ntransferring them to the regenerated tissue (Figure 1.8). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n13\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8 \u2013 Schematic representation of the mechanical contribution of a scaffold as it degrades \n\nover time, and the mechanical contribution of the new host tissue as it forms in the presence of \n\nappropriate mechanical loading (adapted from Badylak et al (2009)). \n\n \n\n? Adequate surface finish \u2013 Cell attachment, the initial step in cell-\n\nbiomaterial surface interaction, is closely related to the surface \n\nproperties of biomaterials (Saltzman, 1997), such as morphology, \n\nhydrophilicity, surface energy and charge (Yang et al, 2002). The \n\nsurface should be conductive to cell growth, promoting cellular \n\nadhesion, migration and differentiation, so that the resultant tissue is \n\ncomparable to the surrounding native tissue with respect to structure \n\nand functionality (Morsi et al, 2008). An adequate surface enables a \n\ngood biomechanical coupling between the scaffold and the new and \n\nhost tissue (Mustafa et al, 2005; Cheng and Teoh, 2004; Zhao et al, \n\n2003; Singhvi et al, 1994). The morphology and the physiochemistry of \n\nthe scaffold\u2019s surface, a material dependent property, are important \n\nfactors that influence cell attachment, migration and intracellular \n\nsignalling in vitro and cell recruitment, as well healing and bonding with \n\nthe cellular host tissue in the tissue-scaffold interface in vivo (McClary et \n\nal, 2000; Healy et al, 1992). \n\nSince most biodegradable materials have a hydrophobic polymer \n\nsurface, chemical activation of the polymer substrate becomes critical in \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\nthe polymer-bioactive molecule (such as proteins or cells) interaction \n\n(Safinia et al, 2005). New efforts have been reported to encourage cell \n\nattachment focusing on mimicking the surface chemistry of autogenous \n\nECM (Hynes, 1992). Several methods were developed to modify \n\npolymer surfaces for improving their wetting characteristics, including \n\nmechanical, wet chemical and atmospheric treatments, as well low-\n\npressure plasma and corona discharge (Chen-Yang et al, 2000; Gupta \n\net al, 2000; Mutel et al, 2000). Plasma treatment techniques enable the \n\nintroduction of desired functionalities and grafting of polymer chains onto \n\nthe surface, thereby improving the adhesive properties, printability, and \n\npermeability of polymer surfaces (Yildirim et al, 2008; Berry et al, 2004; \n\nGrace and Gerenser, 2003; Greene et al, 2003; Tahara et al, 2003; \n\nWebb et al, 1998; Shelton et al, 1988). Such surface treatments remove \n\nsurface contaminants, roughen the polymer surface, and increase \n\nsurface reactivity by altering the surface energy and charge of the \n\nmaterial (Safinia et al, 2005). The modified surfaces that undergo \n\nsurface restructuring with time, a disadvantage of polymer surface \n\ntreatments (Yang et al, 2002), due to the mobility of the polymer chain in \n\nthe amorphous regions (Kim et al, 2003a; Murakami et al, 1998), driven \n\nby the thermodynamic need to lower the overall interfacial energy of the \n\nsystem (Koberstein et al, 1998). \n\n \n\n? Easily manufactured and sterilised \u2013 Implants should be rapidly \n\nproduced with high accuracy and repeatability and easily sterilized by \n\nexposure to high temperatures, UV light, ?-radiation, plasma, ethylene \n\noxide (ETO) gas, or by immersion in a sterilisation agent, remaining \n\nunaffected by either of these processes (Allan et al, 2001; Fischbach et \n\nal, 2001). The sterilisation process must not alter the material\u2019s chemical \n\ncomposition, which can affect its bioactivity, biocompatibility or \n\ndegradation properties. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n15\n \n\n \n\n1.2. Research Aims \n\n \n\nThe design of optimised scaffolds for tissue engineering is a key topic of research, \n\nas the complex macro- and micro- architectures required for a scaffold depends on \n\nthe mechanical properties, physical and molecular queues of the surrounding \n\ntissue within the defect site. Thus, the prediction of the optimal properties for \n\ntissue engineering scaffolds is very important, for mechanical, vascular or \n\ntopological properties. \n\n \n\nThe relationship between high scaffold porosity and high mechanical properties is \n\ncontradictory as it becomes even more complex due to the degradation process of \n\nthe scaffolds. A scaffold design strategy based on the finite element method was \n\ndeveloped in order to optimise the scaffold design, regarding mechanical and \n\nvascular properties as a function of porosity. Scaffolds are considered as a LEGO \n\nstructure formed by an association of small elementary units or blocks. In this \n\nresearch work, two types of family elementary scaffold units were considered: non-\n\ntriple periodic minimal surfaces and triple periodic minimal surfaces that describe \n\nnatural existing surfaces. The main objectives of this research work are: \n\n \n\n? The evaluation of the Tissue Engineering methodology and its different \n\nstrategies; \n\n? The evaluation of the existing biofabrication technologies used to produce \n\ntissue engineering scaffolds; \n\n? The evaluation of the scaffold\u2019s requirements involved in the scaffold\u2019s \n\ndesign; \n\n? The development of an integrated design strategy based on material, \n\nporosity, geometry, mechanical and vascular properties, in order to aid the \n\nscaffold design process; \n\n? The experimental validation of the adopted design strategy. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n1.3. Thesis Structure \n\n \n\nThis thesis is structured into 7 chapters as illustrated in Figure 1.9. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9 \u2013 Flowchart of the topics and objectives that are addressed in the thesis. \n\n \n\nThe first chapter presents a detailed overview of the tissue engineering field, as \n\nwell the tissue engineering scaffolds. An in depth description of scaffolds, \n\nregarding its purpose, functionality, biological and physical requirements and \n\ncharacteristics, is also presented. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n17\n \n\nThe second chapter comprises a detailed description of advanced scaffold \n\nfabrication technologies, namely biomanufacturing. Both conventional and additive \n\nmanufacturing technologies are described, highlighting additive manufacturing. \n\nThe processing procedures from CAD data to physical models are also explained. \n\nBiomanufacturing technologies are grouped into four categories: \n\nStereolithographic Processes, Laser Sintering, Extrusion-based and Three-\n\ndimensional printing. Each category is also defined presenting the most relevant \n\nresearch activities and their results. \n\n \n\nThe third chapter describes the state-of-the-art in computational design and \n\nmodelling methodologies of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications, as \n\nscaffolds can be designed and modelled based on \u00b5CT data or surface/solid CAD \n\nmodelling. Several scaffold unit families are presented, namely Non-Triple Periodic \n\nMinimal Surface and Triple Periodic Minimal Surface geometric models, as well \n\nthe mathematical formulations for the design of Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces. \n\n \n\nThe next three chapters correspond to the numerical simulation, evaluation and \n\nprediction of the scaffold\u2019s behaviour under structural and vascular loading, and its \n\ntopological optimisation. Each chapter presents a detailed state-of-the-art \n\ndescription of the influence of the scaffold\u2019s behaviour on the cells with the \n\ncorresponding finite element formulations involved in the simulations. The \n\nnumerical analysis set-up for each simulation is described and the results are then \n\npresented and discussed for each of the scaffold unit families. Each scaffold\u2019s \n\nnumerical behaviour is evaluated as a function of a design parameter, such as \n\npore size, thickness, radius, etc. Each chapter corresponds to a scaffold \n\nsimulation topic: Chapter Four to its structural simulation, Chapter Five to its \n\nvascular simulation, and Chapter Six to its topological optimisation. \n\n \n\nThe aim of this chapter is to provide an overall summary of the thesis. It starts with \n\na summary and conclusions that can be drawn from the research work carried out. \n\nPossible future directions for research following on this thesis are also presented. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\n \n\n1.4.

Biofabrication \n\n2.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nFabrication techniques to produce 3D scaffolds can be divided into two broad \n\ncategories: conventional techniques and additive technologies (B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2012; \n\nGualandi, 2011; B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2009a; 2009b; 2008; Hutmacher et al, 2008). \n\n \n\n2.2. Conventional Fabrication Techniques \n\n \n\nAccording to Reignier and Huneault (2006), Ho et al (2004), Gomes and Reis \n\n(2004), Ma (2004), Leong et al (2003) and Yang et al (2001), there are several \n\nconventional methods to fabricate scaffolds, as follows: \n\n \n\n? Solvent casting/salt leaching involves mixing solid impurities, such as \n\nsieved sodium chloride particles, into a polymer solvent solution, as well \n\ncasting its dispersion to produce a membrane containing polymer and salt \n\nparticles. The salt particles are then leached out with water to yield a \n\nporous membrane. According to the abovementioned authors, porosity and \n\npore size are dependent on salt weight fraction and particle size, pore \n\ndiameters of 100-500 ?m and porosities of 87-91 % were obtained. \n\n? Phase separation involves dissolving a polymer in a suitable solvent, \n\nplacing it in a mould, and then cooling the mould rapidly until the solvent is \n\nfrozen. The solvent is removed by freeze-drying, leaving behind the \n\npolymer, a foam with pore sizes of 1-20 ?m in diameter. \n\n? Foaming is carried out by either dissolving a gas, usually Carbon Dioxide \n\n(CO2), at elevated pressure or incorporating a chemical blowing agent that \n\nyields gaseous decomposition products. This process generally leads to \n\nporous structures not fully interconnected, and produces a skin-core \n\nstructure. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n? Gas saturation uses high pressure CO2 to produce macroporous sponges \n\nat room temperature. Polymeric sponges with large pores (?100 ?m) and \n\nporosities up to 93% were produced. \n\n? Electrospinning is a process for generating fine fibres by applying an \n\nelectric field to either droplets of a polymer solution or melt, passing through \n\na tip of a fine orifice (Mitchell et al, 2011; Mitchell and Davis; 2011; Greiner \n\nand Wendorff, 2007), as shown in Figure 2.1. As a consequence of the \n\nCoulombic electric forces arising from the application of the high voltage, \n\nthis small droplet will be charged and its shape distorted into a cone-like \n\ngeometry (Taylor, 1964). Dependent on the strength of the applied electric \n\nfield together with the solution or melt viscosity, surface tension and \n\ndielectric properties of the solution, the integrity of the droplet will break \n\ndown and a fine fibre of polymer will be produced and deposited on the \n\ncollector electrode. During the flight, the fibre will be subjected to \n\ninstabilities which extend the fibre and lead to a considerable reduction in \n\nits diameter (Sin et al, 2001; Reneker et al, 2000). An important feature of \n\nthis technique is the production of fibres with diameters ranging from 10 nm \n\n(or even smaller) to a few microns, dimensions not generally available using \n\nother techniques, except at the higher end by melt blowing (Ellison et al. \n\n2007). \n\nDias (2010) used an electrospinning system, developed at the Centre for \n\nRapid and Sustainable Product (Figure 2.2), to obtain tissue meshes \n\ncomposed of nanoscale fibres for cartilage applications. Polycaprolactone \n\nfibres were produced under the following processing conditions: applied \n\nvoltage of 12 kV; feed rate between 0.72 and 3.17 ml/h; needle diameter of \n\n0.6 mm, and distance between tip and collector of 10 cm. Three different \n\nsolvents were also used during this experimental work (acetic acid, \n\ntriethylamine and a mixture of both). Results show that a more homogenous \n\nmesh is obtained by adding triethylamine to the solvent solution. It can also \n\nbe observed that a non uniform dependence of the mesh quality is obtained \n\nwith an increase in the flow rate. Figure 2.3 illustrates SEM results of PCL \n\nfibre meshes with different flow rates and solvent concentrations. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n25\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 A schematic of the key components in the electrospinning technique. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Electrospinning system developed at the CDRSP (Dias, 2010). \n\n \n\nPCL + \nAcetic acid \n\n+ TEA \n\nFlow Rate \n\n0.72 ml/h 3.17 ml/h \n\nC\no\n\nn\nc\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\ntio\nn\n\n \n9\n w\n\nt%\n \n\nAverage Diameter = 0.058 \u00b5m Average Diameter = 0.047 \u00b5m \n\nC\no\n\nn\nc\ne\nn\n\ntr\na\n\ntio\nn\n\n \n1\n1\n w\n\nt%\n \n\nAverage Diameter = 0.050 \u00b5m Average Diameter = 0.047 \u00b5m \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 SEM Results of PCL dissolved in acetic acid and added triethylamine (Dias et al, \n\n2012). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\n \n\nThese techniques present several limitations as they usually do not enable to \n\nproperly control pore size, pore geometry and spatial distribution of pores, on top \n\nof almost not allowing to construct internal channels within the scaffold (Yeong et \n\nal, 2004). Although the shape and size of the pores can vary by changing process \n\nparameters, the resulting scaffold organisation of pores is random. This can lead \n\nto pore pathways that are only partially connected following contorted routes, \n\nwhich could inhibit the supply of nutrients and the ingrowth of tissue within the \n\nscaffold. These techniques are labour-intensive processes with long fabrication \n\ntimes, usually involving the use of toxic organic solvents, which are severe \n\nlimitations. Using these conventional techniques, it is not possible to produce \n\nscaffolds enabling the formation of thick 3D tissues, as the cells proliferate only at \n\nthe surface of the produced matrices (Figure 2.4). Conventional techniques are \n\nlimited in terms of reproducibility and repeatability, due to the lack of pore \n\ninterconnectivity that promotes the so-called M&amp;M effect (cells die due to the lack \n\nof nutrients\u2019 supply and vascularisation). Therefore, additive biofabrication \n\nprocesses are considered as viable alternatives to fabricate scaffolds for tissue \n\nengineering as they offer better control and the ability to actively design the \n\nporosity and interconnectivity of scaffolds. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Cell growth and proliferation of the outer layer of the scaffold, inducing the M&amp;M effect. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n27\n \n\n2.3. Additive Biomanufacturing \n\n \n\nIn 2005, Biomanufacturing was defined as \u201cthe use of additive technologies, \n\nbiodegradable and biocompatible materials, cells, growth factors, etc., to produce \n\nbiological structures for tissue engineering applications\u201d, during a \n\nBiomanufacturing Workshop hosted by Tsinghua University at China. More \n\nrecently, during the Spring 2008 Meeting sponsored by the National Science \n\nFoundation (USA), biomanufacturing was defined as \u201cthe design, fabrication, \n\nassembly and measurement of bio-elements into structures, devices, and \n\nsystems, and their interfacing and integration into / with larger scale structures in \n\nvivo or in vitro environment such that heterogeneity, scalability and sustainability \n\nare possible\u201d. \n\n \n\nA general overview of the necessary steps to produce scaffolds for tissue \n\nengineering through biomanufacturing technologies is illustrated in Figure 2.5 \n\n(B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2012; B\u00e1rtolo, 2006; B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2003). The first step is the \n\ngeneration of the corresponding computer solid model through one of the currently \n\navailable medical imaging techniques, such as computer tomography, magnetic \n\nresonance imaging, etc. These imaging methods produce continuous volumetric \n\ndata (voxel-based data), providing the input data for the digital model generation \n\n(B\u00e1rtolo, 2006). The model is then tessellated as an STL file (Figure 2.6). The STL \n\nmodel is then mathematically sliced into thin layers (sliced model). The data is \n\nthen sent to a biomanufacturing device to produce the biocompatible and \n\nbiodegradable constructs containing or not cells and growth factors. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Steps of biomanufacturing in tissue engineering. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n28 \n \n\nAnatomic Implant Modelling Scaffold Modelling \n\n \nData acquisition \n?

In this format, 3D models are represented by a number of \n\nthree sided planar facets (triangles), each facet defining part of the external \n\nsurface of the object. \n\n \n\nThere are two types of STL file formats, the ASCII (American Standard Code for \n\nInformation Interchange) and Binary file formats. The information contained in \n\neach type of STL file is functionally identical. For each facet, the three vertices and \n\nthe unit normal vector are specified. The format of the data expression is the only \n\ndifference of these two types of file. The structure of an ASCII STL file (Figure 2.7) \n\nstarts with the word solid followed by the name of the file, and ends with the word \n\nendsolid (Chua et al, 2003; Szilv\u00e1si-Nagy and M\u00e1ty\u00e1si, 2003). The coordinates of \n\nthe vertices are ordered according to the right hand screw rule, an anti-clockwise \n\ndirection, such as the normal of the facet directed away from the model (Alves and \n\nB\u00e1rtolo, 2006). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n29\n \n\n \n\nsolid name \n\nfacet normal ni nj nk \n\nouter loop \n\nvertex vx1 vy1 vz1 \n\nvertex vx2 vy2 vz2 \n\nvertex vx3 vy3 vz3 \n\nendloop \n\nendfacet \n\nendsolid name \n\n The STL filename \n\nThe unit normal vector of facet \n\n \n\nCoordinates of vertex 1 \n\nCoordinates of vertex 2 \n\nCoordinates of vertex 3 \n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 The structure of an ASCII STL file format. \n\n \n\nThe generation of the STL representation follows two important rules shown in \n\nFigure 2.8 (Alves and B\u00e1rtolo, 2006; Chen et al, 1999), as follows: \n\n \n\n? Facet orientation rule: the facets define the surface of the 3D object. The \n\norientation of the facet involves the definition of the vertices for each \n\ntriangle in a counter-clockwise order; \n\n? Adjacency rule: each triangular facet must share two vertices with each of \n\nits adjacent triangles. \n\n \n\na)   \n\nb)  c)  \n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 a) Orientation of a triangular facet in a STL file. b) Violation of the vertex-to-vertex rule. \n\nc) A correct triangulation (Alves and B\u00e1rtolo, 2006). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n \n\nTo assure that the adjacency rule is obeyed, it is necessary to verify the following \n\nconsistency rules (Alves and B\u00e1rtolo, 2006): \n\n \n\n? The number of triangles must be even; \n\n? The number of edges must be a multiple of three; \n\n? The number of triangles must be equal to two thirds of the number of \n\nedges. \n\n? The number of vertices is given by: \n\n \n\n0.5 2 (2.1) \n\nwhere V is the number of vertices and T is the number of triangles. \n\n \n\nTo assure that the set of STL triangles comprises a closed volume, it is necessary \n\nto verify the Euler\u2019s rule for solids. According to this rule, the definition of a proper \n\nsolid implies that the following equation is verified (Alves and B\u00e1rtolo, 2006): \n\n \n\n2  (2.2) \n\nwith E being the number of edges, H the number of face holes, B the number of \n\nseparate, disjoint bodies and P the number of passages, i.e., holes through the \n\nentire body. \n\n \n\nTriangles generated by triangulation must be equiangular whenever possible to \n\navoid thin and long triangles. According to Chen et al (1999), the Delaunay \n\ntriangulation satisfies the equiangularity criterion, expressed in terms of the \n\nmaximum of minimum angles in a triangulation. The max-min angle criterion refers \n\nto the choice of the diagonal of a quadrilateral, i.e., a pair of triangles maximising \n\nthe minimum of the six interior angles of the triangles, when the quadrilateral is \n\nstrictly convex. The minimum interior angle \u201cbdc\u201d, illustrated in Figure 2.9.a, is \n\nsmaller that the minimum interior angle \u201cbac\u201d, represented in Figure 2.9.b, so the \n\nsecond triangulation (Figure 2.9.b) is advantageous. If this strategy is locally \n\napplied to all edges of each triangle, the resulting triangulation is globally optimal \n\n(Alves et al, 2012; Chen et al, 1999). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n31\n \n\n \n\na)  \n\nb)  \n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Max-min angle criterion. a) Smaller minimum interior angle. b) Larger minimum interior \n\nangle (Alves et al, 2012; Alves and B\u00e1rtolo, 2008; Chen et al, 1999). \n\n \n\nThe disadvantages of the use of a tessellated representation, as a standard in \n\nadditive manufacturing, are the following ones (Sunil and Pande, 2008): \n\n \n\n? It is a first-order approximation of the original CAD model; \n\n? It is a list of triangles with no topological information; \n\n? High degree of redundancy: each triangle is individually recorded and \n\nshared coordinates are duplicated in the file; \n\n? The user needs to input acceptable cordal tolerance, which is the distance \n\nbetween the plane of a triangle and its approximating surface. Increasing \n\nthe number of triangles smoothens the surface, but leads to larger data \n\nfiles. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nMany CAD systems generate incorrect STL files when the CAD models are very \n\ncomplex. Possible errors are non-manifold facets, gaps, incorrect normals, \n\noverlapping facets, etc (Sunil and Pande, 2008). \n\n \n\nOnce finished, the STL file must be sliced. Slicing refers to intersecting a CAD \n\nmodel with a plane, in order to determine two dimensional contours (Figure 2.10). \n\nThe slicing can be uniform, where the layer thickness is kept constant or adaptive, \n\nthe layer thickness changes based on the surface geometry of the CAD model \n\n(Kulkarni et al, 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10 \u2013 Definition of a layer through the intersection between the 3D STL model and a slicing \n\nplane (Alves and B\u00e1rtolo, 2006). \n\n \n\nAdaptive slicing involves slicing with varying layer thickness. In this strategy, \n\nsurfaces of high curvature are sliced with thinner layer thickness and surfaces of \n\nlow curvature are sliced with thicker layers. Adaptive slicing yields better surface \n\nquality, as the staircase effect decreases and the variations in the cusp height \n\nacross the layers is minimized. The main advantage of adaptive slicing is that it \n\ngives the user explicit control over the surface quality (Kulkarni et al, 2000). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n33\n \n\n \n\n2.3.1. Additive Processes \n\n \n\nAdditive biomanufacturing technologies include different fabrication strategies as \n\nindicated in Figure 2.11 (B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2008). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.11 \u2013 Classification of additive technologies. \n\n \n\nThe main advantages of additive biomanufacturing technologies are both the \n\ncapacity to rapidly produce very complex 3D models and the ability to use various \n\nraw materials. When combined with clinical imaging data, these fabrication \n\ntechniques can be used to produce constructs customised to the shape of the \n\ndefect or injury. Some processes operate at room temperature, thus allowing for \n\ncell encapsulation and biomolecule incorporation without significantly affecting its \n\nviability. In the field of tissue engineering, additive biomanufacturing technologies \n\nare used to produce scaffolds with customised external shape and predefined \n\ninternal morphology, allowing good control of pore distribution and size (B\u00e1rtolo et \n\nal, 2012; B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2008; Leong et al, 2008; Hutmacher et al, 2007; B\u00e1rtolo, \n\n2006; Yeong et al, 2006; 2005; Hutmacher et al, 2004; Tsang and Bhatia, 2004; \n\nLeong et al, 2003). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n34 \n \n\n \n\n(a) Stereolithographic Processes \n\n \n\nStereolithographic processes produce three-dimensional solid objects in a multi-\n\nlayer procedure, through the selective photo-initiated cure reaction of a polymer \n\n(B\u00e1rtolo and Mitchell, 2003). These processes usually employ two distinct \n\nmethods of irradiation. The first method is the mask-based method in which an \n\nimage is transferred to a liquid polymer by irradiating through a patterned mask. \n\nThe irradiated part of the liquid polymer is then solidified. In the second method, a \n\ndirect writing process using a focused UV beam produces polymer structures \n\n(Figure 2.12). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12 \u2013 Stereolithography system. \n\n \n\nThe direct or laser writing approach consists of a vat containing a photosensitive \n\npolymer, a moveable platform on which the model is built, a laser to irradiate and \n\ncure the polymer, and a dynamic mirror system to direct the laser beam over the \n\npolymer surface \u201cwriting\u201d each layer. After drawing a layer, the platform dips into \n\nthe polymer vat, leaving a thin film from which the next layer will be formed. \n\n \n\nMask-based writing systems build models by shining a flood lamp through a mask, \n\nwhich lets light pass through it. These systems generally require the generation of \n\na lot of masks with precise mask alignments. One solution for this problem is the \n\nuse of a liquid crystal display (LCD), or a digital processing projection system as a \n\nflexible mask (Figure 2.13). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n35\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.13 \u2013 Mask-based writing system and polyHEMA constructs produced at the Polytechnic \n\nInstitute of Leiria. \n\n \n\nMicrostereolithography is a relatively recent development, similar to conventional \n\nstereolithography. However, to get a better resolution, the beam needs to be more \n\nprecisely focused, in order to reduce the spot size to a few micrometres of \n\ndiameter. Several strategies were proposed (Bertsch et al, 2003): constrained \n\nsurface techniques, free surface techniques, and integral processes. Integral \n\nmicrostereolithography represents the most recent advancement in this field, \n\nenabling the solidification of each layer in one irradiation step by projecting the \n\ncorresponding image onto the surface of the photo-polymerisable resin, through \n\neither a liquid crystal display or a digital micro mirror device. MicroTEC (Germany) \n\nis one of the few companies producing commercial applications of \n\nmicrostereolithography. This technology, known as Rapid Micro Product \n\nDevelopment (RMPD), uses an excimer laser as a light source that works on a \n\nvector-by-vector basis. \n\n \n\nCurrently, a Multimaterial Microstereo-thermal-lithography system is being \n\ndeveloped at the Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development at the \n\nPolytechnic Institute of Leiria. This novel process combines both Ultra-Violet and \n\nInfrared radiation for a single separate or combined radiation of both light sources, \n\nallowing to process single or multiple materials available in the rotating platform. \n\nFigure 2.14 illustrates the system being developed. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.14 \u2013 Multimaterial microstereo-thermal-lithography system (B\u00e1rtolo, 2011). \n\n \n\nAll of the abovementioned stereolithographic approaches are based on a single-\n\nphoton initiated polymerisation procedure. Two-photon-initiated polymerisation \n\ncuring processes represent a useful stereolithographic alternative strategy to \n\nproduce micro/nanoscale structures by using femtosecond infrared laser without \n\nphoto-masks (Lemercier et al, 2005; Tormen et al, 2004; Kowata and Sun, 2003). \n\nIn this process, the molecule simultaneously absorbs two photons instead of one, \n\nbeing excited to higher singlet states. The use of two-photon-initiated \n\npolymerisation allows a submicron 3D resolution, on top of enabling both a 3D \n\nfabrication at greater depth and an ultra-fast fabrication. \n\n \n\nThe photopolymerisation of biomaterials via multiphoton excitation can also \n\nprovide an efficient method of scaffold microfabrication. In this process, the beam \n\nof an ultra-fast infrared laser is tightly focused into the volume of a photosensitive \n\nmaterial (Figure 2.15). The polymerisation process can be initiated by non-linear \n\nabsorption within the focal volume. A multiphoton excitation was applied to \n\nfabricate scaffolds of a wide range of polymers and bulk protein formulations, such \n\nas collagen, laminin, fibronectin, bovine serum albumin, alkaline phosphatase, etc. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n37\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.15 \u2013 The principle of multiphoton polymerisation. \n\n \n\nSeveral groups developed stereolithographic processes for tissue engineering. \n\nLevy et al (1997) used a direct irradiation stereolithographic process to produce \n\nhydroxyapatite (HA) ceramic scaffolds for orbital floor prosthesis. A suspension of \n\nfine HA powder into a UV-photocurable resin was formulated and used as building \n\nmaterial. The photo-cured resin acts as a binder to hold the HA particles together. \n\nThe resin is then burnt out and the HA powder assembly sintered for \n\nconsolidation. A similar approach was used by Griffith and Halloran (1996) to \n\nproduce ceramic scaffolds using suspensions of alumina, silicon nitride and silica \n\nparticles with a photo-curable resin. The binder was removed by pyrolysis and the \n\nceramic structures sintered. \n\n \n\nBryant and Anseth (2001) used a photopolymerisation process to encapsulate \n\nchondrocytes in poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) hydrogels structures, with thicknesses \n\nvarying from 2 to 8 mm. The hydrogel structures were photo-cured at low light \n\nintensity (? 10 mW/cm2) during 10 minutes. The chondrocytes encapsulated, in the \n\nhydrogel structures and cultured in vitro during 6 weeks, remained viable and \n\nproduced cartilaginous tissue. Results suggest that an increase in the hydrogel \n\nthickness from 2 to 8 mm do not change cell viability and uniformity. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n38 \n \n\nStereolithography is also commonly used to produce a negative replica filled \n\ntypically with ceramic slurries and burnt away during sintering. Chu et al (2001) \n\ndeveloped a lost-mould technique to produce implants with designed channels and \n\nconnection patterns (Figure 2.16). Stereolithography was used to create epoxy \n\nmoulds, designed from negative image of implants. A highly loaded HA-acrylate \n\nsuspension was cast into the mould. The mould and the acrylic binder were \n\nremoved by pyrolysis, and the HA green scaffold submitted to a sintering process. \n\nThe finest channel size achieved was about 366 ?m, and the range of implant \n\nporosity between 26% and 52%. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.16 \u2013 Sintered HA scaffolds produced by a lost-mould technique (Chu et al, 2001). \n\n \n\nA direct fabrication of biopolymeric scaffolds was also reported by Cooke et al \n\n(2002). They used a biodegradable resin mixture of diethyl fumarate, \n\npoly(propylene fumarate) and bisacylphosphine oxide as photoinitiator to produce \n\nscaffolds for bone ingrowth. \n\n \n\nSimilarly, Matsuda and Mizutani (2002) developed a photopolymer containing \n\nbiodegradable copolymer of trimethylene carbonate and ?-caprolactone. UV light \n\nwas also used to fabricate hydrogel polymer scaffolds. The main limitation was the \n\ndevelopment of water-soluble components, both functional and photolabile \n\n(Fischer et al, 2001). \n\n \n\nA mask-based writing system can be used to pattern hydrogel structures with high \n\nresolution. Liu and Bhatia (2002) reported a method where multiple steps of \n\nmicropatterned photopolymerisation processes can be coupled to produce 3D cell \n\nmatrix structures with micro-scale resolution (Figure 2.17). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n39\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.17 \u2013 Process for formation of hydrogel microstructures containing living cells (Liu and \n\nBhatia, 2002). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n40 \n \n\nLan et al (2009) produced poly(propylene fumarate) (PPF) scaffolds with highly \n\ninterconnected porous structure and a porosity of 65%. The scaffolds were coated \n\nby applying accelerated biomimetic apatite and arginini-glycine-aspartic acid \n\npeptide coating to improve cell behaviour. The coated scaffolds were seeded with \n\nMC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts, and their biologic properties were evaluated using an \n\nMTS assay and histologic staining. Melchels et al (2009) used a resin based on \n\npoly(D,L-lactide) macromonomers and a non-reactive diluent to produce porous \n\nscaffolds with gyroid architecture (Figure 2.18). In this work, it was also possible to \n\nobserve that the pre-osteoblasts readily adhered and proliferated well on these \n\nscaffolds. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.18 \u2013 PDLLA scaffolds with a gyroid architecture built by stereolitography. Scale bars \n\nrepresent 500 ?m (Melchels et al, 2009). \n\n \n\nThe main advantages of stereolithographic processes include the ability to fast \n\ncuring at physiological temperatures. Most commonly used photopolymerisable \n\nmaterials for scaffolds include derivatives of polyethylene glycol (PEG) acrylate, \n\nPEG methacrylate, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and modified polysaccharides \n\n(Hutmacher et al, 2004). However, the number of materials with the appropriate \n\ncharacteristics, in terms of biodegradability, biocompatibility and mechanical \n\nproperties, is still limited. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n41\n \n\n \n\n(b) Powder-bed fusion / Laser Sintering processes \n\n \n\nSelective laser sintering (SLS) uses a laser emitting infrared radiation, to \n\nselectively heat powder material just beyond its melting point (Figure 2.19). The \n\nlaser traces the shape of each cross-section of the model to be built, sintering \n\npowder in a thin layer. It also supplies energy that not only fuses neighbouring \n\npowder particles, but also bonds each new layer to those previously sintered. For \n\npolymeric powders, the sintering process takes place in a sealed heated chamber \n\nat a temperature near the melting point filled with nitrogen or argon. After each \n\nlayer is solidified, the piston over the model retracts to a new position and a new \n\nlayer of powder is supplied using a mechanical roller. The powder that remains \n\nunaffected by the laser acts as a natural support for the model, and remains in \n\nplace until the model is complete. An important limitation of SLS is the \n\ndependence between the pores of the scaffold, the particle size of the powder \n\nmaterial and the compaction pressure. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.19 \u2013 Selective laser sintering process. \n\n \n\nMaterials most commonly used in tissue engineering scaffolds by laser sintering \n\nare biocompatible polymers, such as polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly lactic acid \n\n(PLA) and biocompatible ceramics. PCL is a bioresorbable polymer used for bone \n\nand cartilage repair. It is more stable at ambient conditions than PCL, less \n\nexpensive and readily available (Williams et al, 2005). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n42 \n \n\nWilliams et al (2005) explored the potential of SLS to produce PCL scaffolds for \n\nthe replacement of skeletal tissues. The scaffolds were seeded with bone \n\nmorphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) transduced fibroblasts. In vivo results show that \n\nthese scaffolds enhance tissue in-growth, on top of possessing mechanical \n\nproperties within the lower range of trabecular bone. Compressive modulus (52 to \n\n67 MPa) and yield strength (2.0 to 3.2 MPa) were in the lower range of human \n\ntrabecular bone properties. \n\n \n\nLee and Barlow (1996) coated calcium phosphate powder with polymer, by spray \n\ndrying slurry of particulate and emulsion binder. The coated powder was then \n\nsintered to fabricate calcium phosphate bone implants. Afterwards, these \n\nstructures were infiltrated with calcium phosphate solution or phosphoric acid-\n\nbased inorganic cement in order to increase cell behaviour. \n\n \n\nHao et al (2005) investigated the use of SLS to fabricate HA mixed high density \n\npolyethylene (HDPE) scaffolds. Different scanning speeds and laser power values \n\nwere considered. HA and HDPE powders with 40 % HA by volume ratio were \n\nmixed using a high speed blender. Different process parameters resulted in \n\ndifferent sintered morphologies (Figure 2.20). Results show that for low power or \n\nhigh scanning speed the layers were in general not sintered or very fragile. \n\n \n\na)  b)  \n\nFigure 2.20 \u2013 SEM micrograph of sintered layer\u2019s surface with irradiated at 1200 mm/s of scanning \n\nspeed and different laser power: (a) 3.6W.

PLLA microspheres and PLLA/CHAp \n\nnanocomposites microspheres were prepared by emulsion techniques. The \n\nresultant microspheres had a size of 5-30 ?m, suitable for the SLS process. The \n\nuse of PLLA/CHAp nanocomposite microspheres seems to offer a solution to the \n\nproblem of removing the excessive powder from the pores after fabrication. \n\n \n\na)  b)  \n\nFigure 2.21 \u2013 a) SEM image of PLLA/CHAp nanocomposite microspheres. B) PLLA/CHAp \n\nnanocomposite scaffolds (Zhou et al, 2008). \n\n \n\nPopov et al (2004) proposed the concept of Surface Selective Laser Sintering \n\n(SSLS) technique enabling to extend the range of polymers that can be used for \n\nscaffold fabrication. Unlike conventional selective laser sintering, where polymer \n\nhas a strong absorption at the laser wavelength, the SSLS process is based on \n\nmelting the particle. This particle is transparent for laser radiation, due to the laser \n\nbeam absorption by a small amount (<0.1 wt%) of biocompatible carbon black \n\nhomogeneously distributed along the polymer surface. This process allows \n\npreventing significant overheating of the particles internal domains that can lead to \n\nproperty change and degradation. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n44 \n \n\n \n\n(c) Extrusion-based Processes \n\n \n\nThe extrusion-based process, commercially known as Fused Deposition Modelling \n\n(FDM), was developed by Scott Crump (1989). It works on an additive principle by \n\nlaying down material during the construction process in a layer-by-layer fashion. A \n\nplastic filament unwound from a coil or plastic granules within a chamber, supplies \n\nthe material to an extrusion nozzle that extrudes small struts of thermoplastic \n\nmaterial to form the part being produced. The extrusion nozzle is heated to melt \n\nthe material. It can be moved in the horizontal direction as the construction \n\nplatform moves vertically. Both the extrusion nozzle and platform is controlled by a \n\ncomputer to form the three-dimensional object (Figure 2.22). The material leaves \n\nthe extruder in a liquid form and hardens immediately. The previously formed \n\nlayer, which is the substrate for the next layer, must be maintained at a \n\ntemperature just below the solidification point of the thermoplastic material, to \n\nassure good interlayer adhesion. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.22 \u2013 Fused Deposition Modelling process. \n\n \n\nExtrusion-based processes have been used to successfully produce scaffolds in \n\nPCL, PP-TCP, PCL-HA, PCL-TCP with resolution of 250 ?m. Some of the major \n\nlimitations of FDM are both the use of filament-based materials and the high heat \n\neffect on raw material. In order to solve some limitations of the FDM process, such \n\nas the requirement of precursor filaments or high processing temperatures, some \n\nalternative processes were developed. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n45\n \n\n \n\nWoodfield et al (2004) used a FDM-like technique, called 3D Fibre Deposition, to \n\nproduce poly(ethylene glycol)-terephthalate-poly(butylenes terephthalate) \n\n(PEGT/PBT) scaffolds for engineering of articular cartilage (Figure 2.23). By \n\nvarying the co-polymer composition, porosity and pore geometry, scaffolds were \n\nproduced with a range of mechanical properties close to articular cartilage. The \n\nscaffolds seeded with bovine chondrocytes supported a homogeneous cell \n\ndistribution and subsequent cartilage-like tissue formation. \n\n \n\na)  \n\nb)  \n\nFigure 2.23 \u2013 a) The 3D Fiber Deposition system. b) SEM sections of 3D deposited scaffolds with \n\nvarying deposition geometries (Woodfield et al, 2004). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n46 \n \n\nDrexel University researchers (Wang et al, 2004) developed a variation of FDM \n\ncalled Precision Extruding Deposition (PED), for the fabrication of bone tissue \n\nscaffolds (Figure 2.24). In this process, material in pellet or granule form is fed into \n\na chamber where it is liquefied. Pressure from a rotating screw forces the material \n\ndown a chamber and out through a nozzle tip. This process was used by Wang et \n\nal (2004) to directly fabricate PCL scaffolds, with controlled pore size of 250 ?m \n\nand designed structural orientations (0\u00ba/90\u00ba, 0\u00ba/120\u00ba or combined 0\u00ba/120\u00ba and \n\n0\u00ba/90\u00ba patterns). Proliferation studies were performed using cardiomyoblasts, \n\nfibroblasts and smooth muscle cells. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.24 \u2013 Precision Extruding Deposition System developed by Wei Sun at Drexel University. \n\n \n\nIn order to eliminate the elevated temperatures required by the extrusion-based \n\nprocesses, Xiong et al (2005) at Tsinghua University, developed a process called \n\nLow-temperature Deposition Manufacturing (LDM) to produce scaffolds at a low \n\ntemperature environment under 0 \u00baC. The LDM system comprises a multi-nozzle \n\nextrusion process and a thermally induced phase separation process (Figure \n\n2.25). The LDM process was used to produce poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and TCP \n\ncomposite scaffolds with BMP growth factor. The scaffolds were implanted into \n\nrabbit radius and canine radius with large-segmental defects. After 12 weeks, it \n\nwas possible to observe that the rabbit radius defect was successfully repaired \n\nand the regenerated bone had properties similar to the healthy bone. For the \n\ncanine radius, similar results were observed after 24 weeks (Yan et al, 2003a; \n\n2003b). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n47\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.25 \u2013 a) Schematic illustration of the LDM system. b) Example of a porous PLLA/TCP \n\ncomposite scaffold produced by LDM process (Yan et al, 2003a; 2003b). \n\n \n\nThe Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development, Polytechnic Institute \n\nof Leiria, developed a variation of FDM called BioExtruder (Figure 2.26.a) \n\n(Almeida et al, 2010; Mateus et al, 2008). It is a highly reproducible and low cost \n\nsystem enabling the controlled definition of pores into the scaffold, to modulate \n\nmechanical strength and molecular diffusion, as well the fabrication of multi-\n\nmaterial scaffolds. It comprises two different deposition systems: one rotational \n\nsystem for multi-material deposition acted by a pneumatic mechanism, and \n\nanother one for a single material deposition that uses a screw to assist the \n\ndeposition process (Figures 2.26.b and 2.26.c). A new version of this system, the \n\nDual-Bioextruder, comprises a double head extrusion system to process multiple \n\nmaterials (Figure 2.27). \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.26 \u2013 a) Bioextruder System b) Multi-material extrusion system; c) Single-material \n\nextrusion (Almeida et al, 2010; Mateus et al, 2008). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n48 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.27 \u2013 Dual-Bioextruder system. \n\n \n\nRecently, the Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development at the \n\nPolytechnic Institute of Leiria developed another version of the Bioextruder system \n\ncalled BioCell Printing (Figure 2.28). The novel system is composed by four \n\nseparate sections. The first section contemplates the multiple head extrusion \n\nsystem where scaffolds are produced. Scaffolds are then sterilised either \n\nchemically or physically in the second section before the cell seeding in the third \n\nsection. Finally, the cell seeded scaffolds are then cultured in vitro under dynamic \n\nconditions inside the bioreactor located in the last section. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.28 \u2013 Biocell Printing System. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n49\n \n\nBioplotting (Figure 2.29), a technique developed by the Freiburg Materials \n\nResearch Centre and Envisiontec, Germany, uses a pressure-controlled dispenser \n\nto deposit material into a reactive liquid medium of comparable density. This \n\nbalance of media densities, which allows scaffolds to be created without the need \n\nof support structures, is a key characteristic of this process. Buoyancy can be \n\nprovided to the plotted material, making strands of material remaining in the \n\ncorrect position instead of sacking, due to gravitational effects. Figure 2.30 \n\nillustrates some examples of scaffold structures made by the 3D-Bioplotter \n\nsystem. Materials, such as melts of poly(lactides), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), \n\npoly(hydroxybutyrate-co-valeriate), poly(caprolactone), poly(butylenes \n\nterephthalate-block-oligoethylene oxide), solutions of agar and gelatine, collagen \n\nand reactive biosystems involving fibrin formation and polyelectrolyte complexation \n\nwere used by Pfister et al (2004).  \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.29 \u2013 a) The 3D-Bioplotter system. b) Process building of the first layer (Carvalho et al, \n\n2005). \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.30 \u2013 a) Hydroxyapatite scaffold. b) PLGA scaffold (Carvalho et al, 2005). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n50 \n \n\nMoroni et al (2006) reported a novel strategy to create hollow fibres with controlled \n\nshell thickness and lumen diameter, organizing them into 3D scaffolds. Hollow \n\nfibres (Figure 2.31), are made by extrusion of a blend of poly(butylmethacrylate-\n\nmethylmethacrylate) (P(BMA/MMA) and poly(ethylene oxideterephtalate)-co-\n\npoly(butylene terephtalate) (PEOT/PBT), using the Bioplotter system. The polymer \n\nwith lower viscosity tends to shift towards the walls during the flow along the \n\nnozzle of the extruder, due to viscosity differences. The consequent separation of \n\nthe polymers produces a stratification effect. Hollow fibres are produced by \n\nremoving the core polymer through selective dissolution. It was also observed that \n\nbovine primary articular chondrocytes grow and form ECM, not only in the scaffold \n\nmacropores but also inside the hollow cavities (Figure 2.32). The use of these \n\nhollow matrices for selective drug release is under investigation. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.31 \u2013 SEM micrographs of a scaffold before (a) and after (b) leaching out the core material \n\n(Moroni et al, 2006). \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 2.32 \u2013 SEM (a) and optical microscope (b) micrographs showing chondrocytes and ECM \n\nformation inside and outside the hollow fibers (Moroni et al, 2006).

The thickness of the polymer stream can be varied by changing the syringe \n\npressure, solution viscosity, syringe tip diameter and motor speed. A resolution as \n\nlow as 10 ?m was achieved on a 2D structure. \n\n \n\nRobocasting (Figure 2.33), also known as direct-write assembly, consists of a \n\nrobotic deposition of highly concentrated colloidal suspensions capable of fully \n\nsupporting their own weight during assembly, due to their viscoelastic properties \n\n(Miranda et al, 2006). This technique was used to fabricate ?-tricalcium phosphate \n\n(?-TCP) scaffolds (Saiz et al, 2007; Miranda et al, 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.33 \u2013 Illustration of the robocasting fabrication process (Miranda et al, 2006). \n\n \n\nAng et al (2002) developed a rapid prototyping robotic dispersing (RPBOD) \n\nsystem using the same principle of the 3D bio-plotting system to produce chitosan-\n\nHA scaffolds. Solutions of chitosan-HA were extruded into a sodium hydroxide and \n\nethanol medium to induce the precipitation of chitosan. The scaffolds were then \n\nhydrated, frozen and freeze-dried. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n52 \n \n\n \n\n(d) Inkjet / Three-dimensional printing processes \n\n \n\nThree-dimensional printing (3DP) was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of \n\nTechnology (USA) by Sachs et al (1989). The process deposits a stream of micro-\n\nparticles of a binder material over the surface of a powder bed, joining particles \n\ntogether where the object is to be formed (Figure 2.34). A piston lowers the \n\npowder bed, so that a new layer of powder can be spread over the surface of the \n\nprevious layer and then selectively joined to it. Therics Incorporated applied the \n\n3DP process to tissue engineering and developed the TheriForm process to \n\nfabricate drug delivery devices and scaffolds. Scaffolds can be tailored by varying \n\nthe printing speed, the flow rate and drop position of the liquid water-based binder. \n\n3DP operates at room temperature, allowing the use of a wide range of \n\nbiomaterials. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.34 \u2013 3D Printing process. \n\n \n\nKim et al (1998) employed 3DP with particulate leaching to create porous \n\nscaffolds, using polylactide-coglycolide (PLGA) powder mixed with salt particles \n\nand a suitable organic solvent. The salt particles were leached using distilled \n\nwater. Cylindrical scaffolds measuring 8 mm (diameter) by 7 mm (height) with pore \n\nsizes of 45-150 ?m and 60% porosity, were fabricated. Hepatocytes were \n\nsuccessful attached to the scaffolds. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n53\n \n\n \n\nThe influence of pore size and porosity on cell adhesion and proliferation were \n\ninvestigated by Zeltinger et al (2001). Disc shaped poly(L-lactic acid) (L-PLA) \n\nscaffolds measuring 10 mm (diameter) by 2 mm (height) were produced through \n\nboth 3DP and salt and leaching methods. The scaffolds were produced with two \n\ndifferent porosities (75% and 90%) and four different pore size distributions (<38, \n\n38-63, 63-106 and 106-150 ?m), and tested with cell culture using canine dermal \n\nfibroblasts, vascular smooth muscle cells and microvascular epithelial cells. \n\n \n\nLam et al (2002) developed a blend of starch-based powder containing corn-starch \n\n(50%), dextran (30%) and gelatine (20%), bounded by printing distilled water. \n\nCylindrical scaffolds were produced, measuring 12.5 mm (diameter) by 12.5 mm \n\n(height), and infiltrated with different amounts of a copolymer solution consisting of \n\n75% L-PLA and 25% polycaprolactone in dichloromethane to improve their \n\nmechanical properties. \n\n \n\nLeukers et al (2005) produced HA scaffolds with complex internal structures and \n\nhigh resolution. MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded on the scaffolds, and cultivated \n\nunder static and dynamic setups. Dynamic cultivation was performed in perfusion \n\ncontainers with a flow rate of 18 ?l/min. A histological evaluation was carried out to \n\ncharacterise the cell ingrowth process. It was observed that the dynamic \n\ncultivation method lead to a stronger population compared to the static cultivation \n\nmethod. Static cell culture led to multiple cell layers located on the surface of HA \n\ngranules. Dynamic cells culture tends to grow in between the cavities of the \n\ngranules. It was also found that cells proliferated deep into the structure, forming \n\nclose contact to HA granules. \n\n \n\nSachlos et al (2003) used an indirect approach to produce collagen scaffolds with \n\ncomplex internal morphologies and macroscopic shapes by using a 3DP sacrificial \n\nmould. A dispersion of collagen was cast into the mould and frozen. The mould \n\nwas then dissolved with ethanol, and the collagen scaffold was dried with liquid \n\ncarbon dioxide. Further research by Taboas et al (2003), Limpanuphap and Derby \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n54 \n \n\n(2002) and Park et al (1998), also exploited the capabilities of 3DP for tissue \n\nengineering. \n\n \n\nInk-jet printing systems were used to print both aqueous solutions onto supports \n\nand cell within a scaffold (Saunders et al, 2004; Pardo et al, 2003). During the \n\ndroplet formation process, the liquid material experiences shear rates close to 104 \n\ns-1, and similar strains occurs during the impact (Saunders et al, 2004). Therefore, \n\ncells in suspension are subjected to large stresses and deformation. Nevertheless, \n\nink-jet printing is a viable method for cell deposition and patterning (Saunders et \n\nal, 2004). Boland et al (2007) explored a cell and organ printing fabrication \n\nstrategy to print cells and proteins within 3D hydrogel structures. Several \n\nexamples of printed tissues, such as contractile cardiac hybrids, were developed. \n\nAlginate hydrogels were used as support structures. As indicated in Figure 2.35, \n\nendothelial cell attachment was observed. Filopodia can be seen at the leading \n\nedge of the cell, and lamellapodia at the trailing edge, suggesting cell migration \n\ninto pores. It was postulated that local variation in the mechanical compliance of \n\nalginate structures induces cells to attach to the areas with greatest stiffness or \n\nhighest stress. Since endothelial cells are also known to grow well on surfaces, it \n\nis not surprising to observe cell attachment on the inner surfaces of the alginate \n\npores. Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of cell attachment to alginate structures \n\nis still unknown and requires further research. \n\n \n\nSimilar procedures were used by Mironov et al (2003) and Yan et al (2003b), that \n\ndeveloped the concept of cell printing (Figure 2.36). This process prints gels, \n\nsingle cells and cell aggregates offering a possible solution for organ printing. An \n\nanalogous process, called Alginate-based Rapid Prototyping, was developed at \n\nthe Polytechnic Institute of Leiria (Figure 2.37). This process produces alginate \n\nsolid structures, by extruding a solution of sodium alginate, mixed with a solution \n\nof calcium chloride, providing a temporary support for the seeded cells in culture \n\n(B\u00e1rtolo, 2006; B\u00e1rtolo et al, 2004). Alginate is an anionic copolymer composed of \n\nhomopolymeric regions of 1,4-linked ?-D-mannuronic (M blocks) and ?-L-guluronic \n\nacid (G blocks), interspersed with regions of alternating structure. Gelation occurs \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n55\n \n\nwhen divalent ions take part in the interchain ionic binding between G-blocks in the \n\npolymer chain, giving rise to a three dimensional network (Figure 2.38). Such \n\nbinding zones between the G-blocks are often referred to as \u201cegg boxes\u201d. These \n\nions act as cross-linkers stabilising alginate chains to form a gel structure, which \n\ncontains cross-linked chains spread with more freely movable chains that bind and \n\nentrap large quantities of water. The gelification process is characterised by a re-\n\norganisation of the gel network, accompanied by the expulsion of water. Gels \n\ncontaining M-rich alginate are softer and more fragile, and may also have lower \n\nporosity, due to the lower binding strength between the polymer chains and to the \n\nhigher flexibility of the molecules. The gelification process is highly dependent \n\nupon diffusion of gelification ions into the polymer network. Trasmittancy, swelling \n\nand viscoelasticity of alginate structures are highly affected by the M/G ratio. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.35 \u2013 SEM micrographs of endothelial cells attached to alginate structure (Boland et al, \n\n2007).

These technologies have a great potential, offering a high \n\ndegree of freedom for tissue engineering for either the design of scaffolds (pore \n\nsize, pore geometry, orientation, interconnectivity, etc.) or its fabrication. Scaffold \n\nfabrication, using these techniques, allows the possibility of indirectly controlling \n\nmacroscopic properties, such as the bulk mechanical properties and the \n\npermeability for nutrient transport considerations. Several materials can also be \n\nused, enabling the production of both soft and hard scaffolds. These \n\ncharacteristics can enhance the fabrication of biomimetic scaffolds, functionally \n\ngraded scaffolds and scaffolds for complex biomechanical applications. The \n\nemergence of these technologies in tissue engineering also increases the need for \n\nadaptation of the existing standards. Future developments will possibly lead to \n\nestablishing additive biomanufacturing as a key tool for tissue reconstruction and \n\nregeneration. \n\n \n\nScaffold porosity, pore and filament size achieved by additive biomanufacturing \n\ntechniques, are listed in Table 2.1.The main advantages and limitations of additive \n\nbiomanufacturing scaffolds for tissue engineering applications are indicated in \n\nTable 2.2.

Scaffold Design \n\n \n\n3.1. Computational Design in Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\nA temporary three-dimensional scaffold mimicking the physiological functions of \n\nthe native ECM is vital for maintaining the cells\u2019 ability to express their native \n\ndifferentiated phenotypes. An optimal scaffold design will promote cell proliferation \n\nand cell-specific matrix production that would eventually take over the supporting \n\nrole of the degrading scaffold (Leong et al, 2008). In addition to comply with the \n\nlisted biological and physical requirements (see Section 1.1.2), an optimum \n\nscaffold must also have functional and anatomical requirements, similar to the \n\nfunctional gradient of the host tissue or organ. The external geometry and size of \n\nthe scaffold must be the same of the natural tissue, in order to anchor the scaffold \n\nonto the defected location (Leong et al, 2008; Sun et al, 2005). \n\n \n\nIn the past years, several tools have been developed to support the design of \n\nscaffolds for tissue engineering, such as the Computer-Aided Tissue Engineering \n\n(CATE) developed by Sun et al (2004a; 2004b; Sun and Lal; 2002) and the \n\nComputer Aided System for Tissue Scaffolds (CASTS) developed by Naing et al \n\n(2008; 2005). These computational tools (Figure 3.1) integrate different routines \n\nand systems to support both the design and fabrication of scaffolds. The Centre \n\nfor Rapid and Sustainable Product Development developed a computational tool \n\ncalled Expert System for Medical Applications (ESYSMA) enabling the selection of \n\nappropriate materials for medical applications (Moura et al, 2010). Figure 3.1 \n\nexplains how the most relevant advanced engineering systems can be integrated \n\nin order to aid the design and fabrication process for tissue engineering scaffolds. \n\nThese systems integrate several tools and systems ranging from the design to \n\nengineering to the biomanufacturing of the structures, to optimize scaffold\u2019s \n\nperformance. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n60 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Computer Aided Tissue Engineering. \n\n \n\nThis ESYSMA system (Figure 3.1) is structured into four main levels: \n\n \n\n? Level 1: Automatic identification of the appropriated biomaterial for a certain \n\napplication; \n\n \n\n? Level 2: Automatic definition of the most appropriate geometry, porosity and \n\npore topology of scaffolds for a certain application; \n\n \n? Level 3: Automatic definition of the growth factor to be used in a certain \n\napplication; \n\n \n? Level 4: Automatic identification of the manufacturing technology regarding \n\nor not the encapsulation of cells. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n61\n \n\n \n\nThe material\u2019s selection for a specific medical application is performed on the \n\nrequirements of the desired material\u2019s performance based on a hierarchical \n\nknowledge structure, combining Case-Based and Ruled-Based Reasoning. To \n\nidentify the most adequate material, a set of questions and the corresponding \n\nanswers must be carried out concerning issues such as: \n\n \n\n? the biodegradability of the material; \n\n? the permeability to water; \n\n? its absorption ability; \n\n? whether it will be in contact with organic fluids; \n\n? whether it will need to sustain a structural application; \n\n? whether it has to be environmentally responsive to changes of pH and/or \n\ntemperature, etc. \n\n \n\nAn extensive database of biomaterials was also developed and integrated into the \n\ndeveloped system. This computational system can assist in the selection process \n\nof an appropriate biomaterial for a given medical application. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n62 \n \n\n \n\n3.2. Computational Scaffold Modelling \n\n \n\nThe design of optimised scaffolds for tissue engineering is a key topic of research, \n\nas the complex macro- and micro- architectures required for a scaffold depends on \n\nthe mechanical properties, physical and molecular queues of the surrounding \n\ntissue, at the defect site. One way to achieve such hierarchical designs is to create \n\na library of unit cells (the scaffold is assumed to be a \u201cLego\u201d structure), which can \n\nbe assembled through a specific computational tool (Bucklen et al, 2008; Naing et \n\nal, 2008; Adachi, 2006; Hollister, 2005; Cheah et al, 2004). \n\n \n\nThe modelling of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications can be grouped into \n\nfour main domains, as illustrated in Figure 3.2: \n\n \n\n1. The analytical methods contain empirical relationships between \n\nstructural parameters and mechanical properties. They only provide an \n\nestimate of the global mechanical properties. \n\n \n\n2. In the CAD-based modelling method, the porous structure is \n\napproximated using a 3D repetition of building blocks (called \u201cunit cells\u201d) of \n\nsimply geometry. The unit cells can be generated by Boolean operations. \n\nSimple CAD software tools may be used in this process. \n\n \n\n3. The CT-based modelling uses an image-based approach, where a 3D \n\nimage of a structure serves as a basis for the mesh generation. \n\n \nSeveral existing computational tools that can be used to process medical \n\nimaging data and obtain the 3D data of the desired anatomic model, such as \n\nInvesalius, Mimics, 3D-Doctor, Anatomics. \n\n \n\nInvesalius is a free medical software used to reconstruct structures of the \n\nhuman body. It is based on two-dimensional images, acquired by Computed \n\ntomography or Magnetic resonance imaging equipments. The software \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n63\n \n\ngenerates virtual three-dimensional models correspondent to anatomical \n\nparts of the human body. After reconstructing three-dimensionally the DICOM \n\nimages, the software allows the generation of STL files. These files can then \n\nbe used for additive fabrication. Invesalius was developed at Renato Archer \n\nTechnology of Information Centre (CTI), a research institute of the Brazilian \n\nScience and Technology Centre. \n\n \n\nMimics is another medical imaging processing software package for 3D \n\ndesign and modelling, developed by Materialise NV, Belgium. Mimics \n\ngenerates and modifies surface 3D models from stacked image data such as \n\nComputed Tomography (CT), Confocal Microscopy, Micro CT, and Magnetic \n\nResonance Imaging (MRI) through image segmentation. The 3D files are \n\nrepresented in the STL format. The most common input format is DICOM, but \n\nother image formats such as TIFF, JPEG, BMP and Raw are also \n\ncompatible. The output file formats differ, depending on the subsequent \n\napplication: common 3D output formats include STL, VRML, PLY and DXF. \n\nThe 3D files can also be optimized for FEA or CFD, and then exported to \n\nAbaqus in INP format, to Ansys in INP, CDB and MSH format, to Nastran in \n\nOUT, NAS and BDF format, and to Comsol in MPHTXT format. The files can \n\nalso be exported in IGES format or as Point Cloud Data for Computer-aided \n\ndesign. \n\n \n\n4. The Homogenisation theory is a multi-level approach, where the micro-\n\nlevel model represents the exact micro-architecture of the structure, while the \n\nmacro-level model is a continuum model of the whole structure. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n64 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Modelling Structure of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. \n\n \n\nThe CT-based modelling and the Homogenisation theory are very complex \n\nmethods. These two methods need powerful computers in order to undergo the \n\nmodelling and numerical calculations, due to the high number elements within the \n\npolygon meshes. In order to overcome the existing limitations of these methods, a \n\nCAD-based modelling strategy was adopted for this research work (Figure 3.3). \n\nThus CAD-based modelling approach uses finite element methods for the \n\nnumerical simulation of both the mechanical and vascular behaviour and the \n\ntopological optimisation, as well analytical methods to compare experimental \n\nresults with numerical data. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Modelling Structure of scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n65\n \n\n \n\n3.3. Computer Aided Design of Scaffolds (CADS) \n\n \n\nThe prediction of the effective optimal properties of tissue scaffolds is very \n\nimportant for tissue engineering applications, to obtain the mechanical, vascular or \n\ntopological properties. To implement the proposed strategy, already defined in the \n\nprevious Section (3.2), a computational tool was developed, named Computer-\n\nAided Design of Scaffolds (CADS), enabling to quantify the structural \n\nheterogeneity, and the mechanical and vascular properties of a scaffold with a \n\ndesigned macro and microstructure. \n\n \n\nCADS comprises 4 main domains for the modelling, simulation and optimisation of \n\nscaffolds: \n\n \n\n? The first domain concerns the scaffold modelling, where two types of \n\nscaffold units can be defined, namely non-triple and triple periodic minimal \n\nsurfaces. \n\n? The second domain regards the biomaterial properties for hard or soft \n\ntissue applications. In this case, the materials considered can be \n\ncharacterized by the ESYSMA material database. After this material \n\nselection process, the selected material\u2019s properties are introduced in the \n\nCADS platform for the numerical calculations. \n\n? The third domain is concerned with the material behaviour. Two analytical \n\nmodels are considered, namely linear and non-linear elasticity. \n\n? The fourth domain corresponds to the type of analysis to be performed: \n\nmechanical, vascular or topological optimisation. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 illustrates the four domains and its contents within the CADS software. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n66 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013 Structure of CADS. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n67\n \n\n3.4.

Two types of elementary scaffold \n\nunits were considered: \n\n \n\n? Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces; \n\n? Triple periodic minimal surfaces. \n\n \n\n3.4.1.

Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces \n\n \n\nMinimal periodic surfaces are the most studied hyperbolic surfaces. If a minimal \n\nsurface has space group symmetry, it is periodic in three independent directions, \n\nso it is called Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces (TPMS) (Qi and Wang, 2009; Jung \n\net al, 2007; Wang, 2007; Gandy et al, 2001; Wohlgemuth et al, 2001). \n\n \n\nTPMS are also biomimetic surfaces describing several natural shapes, such as \n\nlyotropic liquid crystals, zeolite sodalite crystal structures, diblock polymers, \n\nhyperbolic membranes (prolamellar structure of choloroplasts in plants), \n\nechinoderm plates (interface between the inorganic crystalline and organic \n\namorphous matter in the skeleton), cubosomes and certain cell membranes \n\n(Larsson et al, 2003; Hyde, 1996; Andersson, 1983; Scriven, 1976). \n\n \n\nA periodic surface can be defined as: \n\n \n\n? cos 2 ? ?  (3.3) \n\nwhere  is the location vector in Euclidean space,  is the  lattice vector in \n\nreciprocal space,  is the magnitude factor,  is the wavelength of periods,  is \n\nthe phase shift, and C is a constant. Specific periodic structures and phases can \n\nbe constructed based on this implicit form (Qi and Wang, 2009; Wang, 2007). \n\n \n\nIn the case of the TPMS, the Weierstrass formula describes their parametric form \n\nin the following way: \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n74 \n \n\n1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n (3.4) \n\nwhere ? is a complex variable, ? is the so-called Bonnet angle, and R(?) is the \n\nfunction that varies for different surfaces. \n\n \n\nFrom a multi-dimensional control parameter space view, the geometric shape of a \n\nperiodic surface is specified by a periodic vector, defined by the following equation \n\n(Qi and Wang, 2009; Wang, 2007): \n\n \n\n? , , ,??

Structural Analysis \n\n \n\n4.1. Mechanical Behaviour of Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\nIt is well known that tissues grow and remodel in response to changes in \n\nmechanical forces (Wang and Thampatty, 2006), and a typical example is bone, \n\nwhich changes its shape, density, and stiffness when the mechanical loading \n\nconditions are altered (Turner and Pavalko, 1998; Mullender et al, 2004). Similarly, \n\nblood vessels remodel themselves in response to altered blood pressure and \n\nshear stress (Owens, 1996; Williams, 1998). On the other hand, the mechanical \n\nforces play a fundamental role in the regulation of cell functions, including gene \n\ninduction, protein synthesis, cell growth, death, and differentiation, which are \n\nessential to maintain tissue homeostasis. Abnormal mechanical loading conditions \n\nalter cellular function and change the structure and composition of the ECM, \n\neventually leading to tissue or organ pathologies such as osteoporosis, \n\nosteoarthritis, tendinopathy, atherosclerosis, and fibrosis in the bone, cartilage, \n\ntendon, vessels, heart, lung, and skin (Bag et al, 2004; Borer et al, 2004; Eckes \n\nand Krieg, 2004; Lammerding et al, 2004; Ingber, 2003; Riley et al, 2002; Ireland \n\net al, 2001; Grodzinsky et al, 2000; Chicurel et al, 1998; Ross, 1986). \n\n \n\nThe mechanical stimulation induced on the cells, to increase their proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation or its biological process, which is regulated by mechanical signals, is \n\ndesignated as Mechanobiology (Chen et al, 2011). This domain has been \n\nreceiving increasing attention over the recent years (van der Meulen and Huiskes, \n\n2002; Huiskes et al, 2000). It is believed that biophysical stimulus play a key role \n\nin regulating the tissue growth and remodelling process of bones (Jacobs et al, \n\n2010; Kelly and Jacobs, 2010), during the fracture healing process (Kelly and \n\nPrendergast, 2005; Carter et al, 1988) or the tissue regeneration process in \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n80 \n \n\nporous scaffolds (Tsubota et al, 2009; Adachi et al, 2006). A mechano-regulatory \n\nmodel can be defined as the mechanical strain and fluid flow that modulates cell \n\ndifferentiation, showing considerable potential to capture the growth details of \n\nvarious cell phenotypes under different levels of biophysical stimuli (Prendergast \n\net al, 1997). Byrne et al (2007) divided this phenomenon into two different levels. \n\nThe first one at the scaffold level, where the mechanical and fluidic fields were \n\nanalysed through a poroelasticity model. The second one at the cellular level, \n\nwhere the proliferation and differentiation of MSCs were simulated based on the \n\ncorrelation between the levels of mechano-regulatory stimuli and experimental \n\ndata. Mechanical loading not only affects the ECM synthesis of native tissues, but \n\nalso modulates the ECM structure, composition, and mechanical properties of \n\ntissue engineering constructs (Wang and Thampatty, 2006). \n\n \n\nIn this research work, the Byrne et al (2007) approach was adopted by considering \n\nthe mechano-regulatory model at the scaffold level, where the mechanical and \n\nvascular behaviour were analysed. Once the scaffold is seeded and cultured, the \n\nformation of tissues with desirable properties relies on the scaffold\u2019s mechanical \n\nproperties, both at a macroscopic and microscopic level. Macroscopically, the \n\nscaffold must bear loads to provide stability to the tissues as they form and fulfil its \n\nvolume maintenance function. At the microscopic level, cell growth and \n\ndifferentiation and the ultimate tissue formation are dependent on the mechanical \n\ninput to the cells. Consequently, the scaffold must be able to both withstand \n\nspecific loads and transmit them, in an appropriate manner, to the growing and \n\nsurrounding cells and tissues. The specific mechanical properties of scaffolds that \n\nwere considered in this research work were the elasticity, compressibility and \n\ntensile strength. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n81\n \n\n \n\n4.2. Constitutive Equations for Structural Analysis \n\n \n\nMany natural materials are not fully dense, i.e. they possess internal cavities \n\nsimilar to the designed structures considered in this research work. This type of \n\ndesign is intentional, since it reduces the structure\u2019s density, and in some cases \n\npresent optimal performance regarding mechanical solicitations (Meyers et al, \n\n2008). An example of a biological cellular material is cancellous bone, which is \n\ndesigned to have a variable density, where regions subjected to higher stresses \n\nare denser (Meyers et al, 2008). By definition, a cellular solid (Figure 4.1) is made \n\nup of an interconnected network of solid struts or plates, which form the edges and \n\nfaces of cells (Gibson and Ashby, 1997). According to this definition, polymeric \n\nand ceramic tissue engineering scaffolds are characterized as cellular structures. \n\nThe stress\u2013strain curve for a cellular solid in compression is characterized by \n\ndifferent behaviours (Figure 4.2): i) a linear elastic one, corresponding to cell edge \n\nbending or face stretching; ii) a stress plateau, corresponding to progressive cell \n\ncollapse by elastic buckling, iii) a plastic yielding or brittle crushing, depending on \n\nthe nature of the solid from which the material is made; and iv) a densification one, \n\ncorresponding to the collapse of the cells throughout the material and subsequent \n\nloading of the cell edges and faces against one another (Gibson, 2005). Figure 4.3 \n\nillustrates the compression stress-strain curve for cancellous bone with three \n\ndifferent relative densities (Meyers et al, 2008; Gibson and Ashby, 1997). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n82 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Examples of cellular solids in nature: (a) balsa wood (b) cork (c) inner core of plant \n\nstem in (g) (d) trabecular bone (e) iris leaf (f) skull (g) plant stem (h) porcupine quill.

Crushable Foam Behaviour \n\n \n\nThe constitutive model for crushable foams, described in this section, is \n\nconsidered for the analysis of materials typically used in energy absorption \n\nstructures. The crushable foam plasticity models present the following \n\ncharacteristics: \n\n \n\n? can be used to model crushable materials other than foams, such as balsa \n\nwood; \n\n? are used to model the enhanced ability of a foam material to deform in \n\ncompression, due to cell wall buckling processes. It is assumed that the \n\nresulting deformation is not instantaneously recoverable, ideally presenting \n\na plastic behaviour for short duration events; \n\n? can be used to model the difference between a foam material's \n\ncompressive strength and its much smaller tensile bearing capacity, \n\nresulting from the cell wall breakage in tension; \n\n? must be used in conjunction with the linear elastic material model; \n\n? can be used when rate-dependent effects are important; \n\n? are intended to simulate material response under essentially monotonic \n\nloading. \n\n \n\nTwo phenomenological constitutive models are presented: \n\n \n\n? The volumetric hardening model; \n\n? The isotropic hardening model. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n87\n \n\nBoth models use a yield surface with an elliptical dependence of either the \n\ndeviatoric stress or the pressure stress in the meridional plane. \n\n \n\nThe volumetric hardening model was developed based on the different response \n\nfoam structures usually experience in compression and tension. In compression \n\nthe ability of the material to deform volumetrically is enhanced by cell wall buckling \n\nprocesses, as described by Gibson et al (1982), Gibson and Ashby (1982) and \n\nMaiti et al (1984). It is assumed that the resulting deformation is not \n\ninstantaneously recoverable, ideally presenting a plastic behaviour for short \n\nduration events. On the other hand, in tension, cell walls break readily, as a result \n\nthe tensile load bearing capacity of crushable foams may be considerably smaller \n\nthan its compressive load bearing capacity. Under monotonic loading, the \n\nvolumetric hardening model assumes perfectly plastic behaviour for pure shear \n\nand negative hydrostatic pressure stress states, while hardening takes place for \n\npositive hydrostatic pressure stress states. \n\n \n\nThe isotropic hardening model was originally developed for metallic foams by \n\nDeshpande and Fleck (2000). It assumes symmetric behaviour in tension and \n\ncompression, and the evolution of the yield surface is governed by an equivalent \n\nplastic strain, contributes for both the volumetric plastic strain and the deviatoric \n\nplastic strain. \n\n \n\nThis isotropic foam model crushes one-dimensionally with a Poisson's ratio that is \n\nessentially zero. The stress\u2013strain behaviour is depicted in Figure 4.4, showing an \n\nexample of unloading from point \u201ca\u201d to the tension cut-off stress at \u201cb\u201d, then \n\nunloading to point \u201cc\u201d, and finally reloading to point \u201cd\u201d. At point \u201cd\u201d the reloading \n\nwill continue along the loading curve. It is important to use nonzero values for the \n\ntension cut-off, to prevent the disintegration of the material under small tensile \n\nloads. For high values of tension cut-off, the behaviour of the material will be \n\nsimilar in tension and compression. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n88 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 Yield stress versus volumetric strain curve for the crushable foam. \n\n \n\nFor the implementation of this model, it is assumed that the Young's modulus is \n\nconstant and the stress elastic behaviour updated along time, as follows: \n\n \n\n?

A linear elastic behaviour model for small deformations within the scaffold\u2019s \n\nelastic domain; \n\n? A crushable foam behaviour model, where a linear elastic model was also \n\nconsidered for the deformation within the elastic domain, combined with the \n\nvolumetric hardening model for the high deformations within the plastic \n\ndomain. The volumetric hardening model is the most adequate model, as \n\nthe cellular structures considered in this work are polymer based. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n95\n \n\n \n\n4.3.

For instance, with the same \n\nlevel of porosity, one may define two different Schwartz structures with two levels \n\nof mechanical behaviour. In other words, they are more advantageous for scaffold \n\nmodelling. Within the triple periodic minimal surfaces, the Schwartz and Schoen \n\nsurfaces have similar mechanical behaviour, in spite of the Schwartz ones that \n\npresent a higher number of geometric variations for both radius and thickness \n\nvariations. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n120 \n \n\n \n\n4.4.2.

The \u201cRate sensitivity via damping \n\ncoefficient\u201d is a material parameter that must be defined, in spite of not being \n\nnecessary for the performed simulations. This parameter would only be used in \n\nthe case of impact simulations, which is not the case being investigated. \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Material compressive properties. \n\nPore Size \n\n[\u00b5m] \n\nMass Density \n\n[g/mm3] \n\nBulk Modulus \n\n[MPa] \nPoisson \n\nratio \nMaximum Stress \n\n[MPa] \nRate sensitivity via \ndamping coefficient \n\n450 \n\n0.0011 \n\n54.218 \n\n0.33 \n\n13.200 \n0.275 \n\n(0.05<recommended \nvalue<.50) \n\n550 85.165 13.003 \n\n660 51.857 9.473 \n\n \n\nFor simulation purposes, scaffolds were assumed to be rectangular structures with \n\nthe following dimensions: \n\n \n\n? length ( ): 2.5 mm; \n\n? width ( ): 2.5 mm; \n\n? height ( ): 4.0 mm. \n\n \n\nAdditionally, it was considered a rigid body attached to the scaffold simulating the \n\nmachine\u2019s clamp (see Figure 4.32). A constant velocity of 0.1667 mm/ms was \n\ndefined for the movement of the rigid block for the compression of the scaffolds. \n\nThis value is 10000 higher than the experimental value (0.00001667 mm/ms). The \n\nreason for this velocity is related to computational time, as it was not possible to \n\nundergo the simulations with the real compression velocity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n121\n \n\nThe mechanical properties for the rigid body were defined in such a way that the \n\nrigid body had sufficient strength to perform the scaffold\u2019s compression without \n\nsuffering any kind of deformation. The use of rigid body element is to impose \n\ndeformation on another body tested without suffering deformation. A limit \n\ndislocation value was also defined for the rigid body. Once it reaches 50 % of the \n\nscaffold\u2019s height, the compressive simulation is complete as the strain value \n\nreaches the value of 1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.32 \u2013 Rigid body for compressive solicitation upon the scaffold. \n\n \n\nScaffolds with three different dimensions of pore sizes were considered (450, 550 \n\nand 650 um). Figure 4.33 illustrates the numerical compressive stress-strain \n\nbehaviours for the different scaffolds. It is possible to observe that as the pore size \n\nincreases, the compressive strengths of the scaffolds decrease. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n122 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.33 \u2013 Numerical compressive stress-strain curves for the three different pore sizes. \n\n \n\nFigures 4.34 to 4.36 illustrate the obtained numerical stress-strain curves with the \n\nsigmoid fitted curves, while Figures 4.37 to 4.39 shows the obtained fitted stress-\n\nstrain curves with the average experimental stress-strain curves. From the \n\nobtained curves, it is possible to observe that the densification phenomenon is not \n\nconsidered in the numerical calculations, so that the numerical calculations for the \n\ncompressive simulations need to be optimised. From the comparisons of the \n\nexperimental results and the fitted curves, it is possible to observe that the scaffold \n\nwith a pore size of 550 \u00b5m presents the most significant deviation, at the end of \n\nthe compression cycle. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n123\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.34 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical stress-strain curve and the sigmoid fitted curve \n\nfor the scaffold with a pore size of 450 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.35 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical stress-strain curve and the sigmoid fitted curve \n\nfor the scaffold with a pore size of 550 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n124 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.36 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical stress-strain curve and the sigmoid fitted curve \n\nfor the scaffold with a pore size of 650 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.37 \u2013 Comparison between the numerical stress-strain curve and the sigmoid curve fitting \n\nfor the scaffold with a pore size of 450 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n125\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.38 \u2013 Comparison between the average stress-strain curve and the sigmoid curve fitting for \n\nthe scaffold with a pore size of 550 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.39 \u2013 Comparison between the average stress-strain curve and the sigmoid curve fitting for \n\nthe scaffold with a pore size of 650 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n126 \n \n\nUsing numerical simulations, it is possible to visualize the compressive testing \n\nduring the calculation time cycle. From these numerical simulations, stress and \n\nstrain plots were obtained at the following time steps of the compressive testing: \n\n20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 % and 100 %. Figures 4.40, 4.41 and 4.42 illustrate the \n\nstrain behaviour for each scaffold pore size. Figures 4.43, 4.44 and 4.45 illustrate \n\nthe stress behaviour for each scaffold pore size. \n\n \n\nResults show that the scaffold with a pore size of 450 \u00b5m presents the highest \n\ndensification, presenting the smallest deviation between the numerical and \n\nexperimental stress-strain curves. Regarding the scaffold with a pore size of 550 \n\n\u00b5m, since the scaffold\u2019s filaments tend to bulge outwards of the scaffold, which \n\nresults in a structure that presents the lowest densification compared to the other \n\nscaffolds and the experimental results, that\u2019s why the numerical stress-strain curve \n\nfor the scaffold with a pore size of 550 \u00b5m presents the biggest deviation between \n\nthe numerical and experimental stress-strain curves. Regarding the scaffold with a \n\npore size of 650 \u00b5m, Figures 4.44 and 4.45 illustrate a more balanced \n\ncompression, except in the centre of the scaffold, when compared to the other \n\nscaffold structures. The three structures tend to bulge outwards when undergoing \n\nthe compressive simulations, the smaller is the bulge phenomenon, the higher is \n\nthe densification, presenting a good agreement between the numerical curves and \n\nthe experimental curves. \n\n \n\nIn order to optimise the numerical simulations, two aspects need to be addressed. \n\nOne regards the filament\u2019s contact and penetration parameters. The other one \n\naspect relates to the mesh elements of the scaffolds. The CAD models present \n\n100 % symmetry in all three axes, although the obtained meshed body do not \n\npresent 100 % symmetry resulting in an unbalanced bulge phenomenon, during \n\nthe compressive testing. In the case of the meshed elements present 100 % \n\nsymmetry within the meshed body, the densification phenomenon could be more \n\nsignificant in all three scaffolds, due to a higher balanced compression process of \n\nthe structures. Nonetheless, due to the complexity of the structures, a mesh with \n\n100% symmetry is difficult to obtain. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n127\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.40 \u2013 Strain variation regarding increments of 20% of compression for the scaffold with a \n\npore size of 450 \u00b5m. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n128 \n \n\n \nFigure 4.41 \u2013 Stress variation regarding increments of 20% of compression for the scaffold with a \n\npore size of 450 \u00b5m. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n129\n \n\n \nFigure 4.42 \u2013 Strain variation regarding increments of 20% of compression for the scaffold with a \n\npore size of 550 \u00b5m. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n130 \n \n\n \nFigure 4.43 \u2013 Stress variation regarding increments of 20% of compression for the scaffold with a \n\npore size of 550 \u00b5m. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n131\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.44 \u2013 Strain variation regarding increments of 20% of compression for the scaffold with a \n\npore size of 650 \u00b5m. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n132 \n \n\n \nFigure 4.45 \u2013 Stress variation regarding increments of 20% of compression for the scaffold with a \n\npore size of 650 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n133\n \n\n \n\n(a) Summary \n\n \n\nFor the crushable foam simulations, the scaffold with a pore size of 450 \u00b5m \n\npresented the best numerical results when compared to the experimental data.

Vascular Analysis \n\n \n\n5.1. Vascular Behaviour of Scaffolds in Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\nMost tissues in the body rely on blood vessels to supply the individual cells with \n\nnutrients and oxygen. For a tissue to grow beyond 100-200 \u00b5m (the diffusion limit \n\nof oxygen), new blood-vessel formation is required (Carmeliet and Jain, 2000), \n\nand this is also true for tissue-engineered constructs. During in vitro culture, larger \n\ntissue-engineered constructs can be supplied with nutrients, for instance in \n\nperfusion bioreactors (Janssen et al, 2006; Portner et al, 2005). However, after \n\nimplantation of tissue constructs, the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the implant \n\nis often limited by diffusion processes that can only supply cells in a proximity of \n\n100-200 \u00b5m from the next capillary. In order for implanted tissues of greater size to \n\nsurvive, the tissue has to be vascularised, which means that a capillary network \n\ncapable of delivering nutrients to the cells is formed within the tissue. After \n\nimplantation, blood vessels from the host generally invade the tissue to form such \n\na network, in part in response to signals that are secreted by the implanted cells \n\nas a reaction to hypoxia (Rouwkema et al, 2008). \n\n \n\nHowever, this spontaneous vascular ingrowth is often limited to several tenths of \n\nmicrometres per day (Clark and Clark, 2005), meaning that the time needed for \n\ncomplete vascularisation of an implant of several millimetres is in the order of \n\nweeks. During this time, insufficient vascularisation can lead to nutrient \n\ndeficiencies and/or hypoxia deeper in the tissue. Moreover, nutrient and oxygen \n\ngradients will be present in the outer regions of the tissue, which could result in \n\nnon-uniform cell differentiation and integration and thus decreased tissue function \n\n(Malda et al, 2004). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n136 \n \n\nAs an attempt to overcome this issue, Mironov et al (2009) used an additive \n\nmanufacturing technique based on organ printing of tissue spheroids as building \n\nblocks for the biofabrication of living organs composed of both functional organ \n\ntissue and an internal branched vascular tree. Closely placed tissue spheroids \n\nundergo tissue fusion, a process that represents a fundamental biological and \n\nbiophysical principle of developmental biology-inspired directed tissue self-\n\nassembly. It is possible to engineer small segments of an intra-organ branched \n\nvascular tree by using solid and lumenized vascular tissue spheroids. By using two \n\ntypes of spheroids, one for the organ tissue and the other for the vascular tree, \n\nand with the aid of the tissue fusion process, it is possible to obtain an organ fully \n\nvascularised. Figure 5.1 represents a roadmap proposed by Mironov et al (2009) \n\nfor the biofabrication of vascularised organs. \n\n \n\nBecause the speed of vascularisation after implantation is a major problem in \n\ntissue engineering, the successful use of tissue-engineered constructs is currently \n\nlimited to thin or avascular tissues, such as skin or cartilage, for which post-\n\nimplantation neovascularisation from the host is sufficient to meet the demand for \n\noxygen and nutrients (Jain et al, 2005). To succeed in the application of tissue \n\nengineering for bigger tissues, such as bone and muscle, the problem of \n\nvascularisation has to be solved (Johnson et al, 2007). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n137\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 \u2013 Roadmap for the biofabrication of organs fully vascularised (Mironov et al, 2009). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n138 \n \n\n \n\n5.2. Blood Characteristics \n\n \n\nBlood is a specialized bodily fluid composed of a liquid called blood plasma and \n\nblood cells suspended within the plasma. The blood cells present in blood are red \n\nblood cells (also called erythrocytes), white blood cells (including both leukocytes \n\nand lymphocytes) and platelets (also called thrombocytes). Plasma is \n\npredominantly water containing dissolved proteins, salts and many other \n\nsubstances, which amounts up to 55% of blood by volume (Humphrey and \n\nDelange, 2003). \n\n \n\nThe most abundant cells in blood are by far red blood cells. These cells contain \n\nhemoglobin, an iron-containing protein, which facilitates transportation of oxygen \n\nby reversibly binding to this respiratory gas and greatly increasing its solubility in \n\nblood. In contrast, carbon dioxide is almost entirely transported extracellularly \n\ndissolved in plasma as bicarbonate ion. White blood cells help to resist infections \n\nand parasites, and platelets are important in blood clotting (Humphrey and \n\nDelange, 2003). \n\n \n\nBlood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action \n\nof the heart. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the body tissues and \n\nvenous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by \n\ncells, from the tissues to the lungs to be exhaled. One aspect that must always be \n\ntaken into account is that blood properties vary with factors such as age, gender, \n\nrace and health. All these make it impossible to define a specific value for a certain \n\nblood property, for instance its density (Humphrey and Delange, 2003). \n\n \n\nBlood pressure refers to the force exerted by circulating blood within the walls of \n\nblood vessels. The pressure of the circulating blood decreases as blood moves \n\nthrough arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and veins. Usually, blood pressure refers to \n\narterial pressure, i.e., the pressure in the larger arteries, where arteries are the \n\nblood vessels taking blood away from the heart. Arterial pressure is most \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n139\n \n\ncommonly measured via a sphygmomanometer, which uses the height of a \n\ncolumn of mercury to determine the circulating pressure. Although many modern \n\nvascular pressure devices no longer use mercury, vascular pressure values are \n\nstill universally reported in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) (Humphrey and \n\nDelange, 2003). \n\n \n\nThe systolic arterial pressure is defined as the peak pressure in the arteries, which \n\noccurs near the beginning of the cardiac cycle, while the diastolic arterial pressure \n\nis the lowest pressure at the resting phase of the cardiac cycle. The average \n\npressure throughout the cardiac cycle is a mean arterial pressure, while the pulse \n\npressure reflects the difference between the maximum and minimum pressures \n\nmeasured (Humphrey and Delange, 2003). \n\n \n\nTypical values for a resting, healthy adult human are approximately 120 mmHg (16 \n\nkPa) systolic and 80 mmHg (11 kPa) diastolic with large individual variations. \n\nThese measures of arterial pressure are not static, but undergo natural variations \n\nfrom one heartbeat to another, as well throughout the day in a circadian rhythm. \n\nThey also change in response to stress, nutritional factors, drugs, or disease. \n\nHypertension refers to arterial pressure being abnormally high, as opposed to \n\nhypotension, when it is abnormally low. Blood pressure measurements are the \n\nmost commonly measured physiological parameters along with body temperature \n\n(Humphrey and Delange, 2003). \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n140 \n \n\n \n\n5.3. Constitutive Equation of Blood Flow \n\n \n\nBlood is not a homogeneous medium mainly consisting of plasma and a \n\nsuspension of red blood cells. White cells, or leukocytes, and platelets present in \n\nsmaller concentrations, play an important role in biochemical processes, like \n\nimmune response, inflammation, and coagulation (Humphrey and Delange, 2003). \n\nWhole blood has a pseudoplastic flow behaviour (Figure 5.2), characterized by a \n\nviscosity (resistance to flow) that is lower at higher shear rates than at lower shear \n\nrates. A pseudoplastic behaviour is also called shear thinning, mainly due to \n\nparticles within the fluid aggregating at low shear rates but \"breaking\" at higher \n\nshear rates, which lowers the viscosity (Humphrey and Delange, 2003). Red blood \n\ncells tend to aggregate at lower shear rates, a phenomenon known as rouleaux \n\n(Figure 5.3), which depends on the presence of fibrinogen and globulins \n\n(Humphrey and Delange, 2003). In the limit, as the shear rate goes to zero, the \n\nblood will tend to further aggregate, eventually leading to a process known as \n\nclotting, which involves additional mechanisms, including platelet activation and \n\nthe conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, an essential component of a clot. As the \n\nshear rate increases from low, but nonzero values, the rouleaux break up and \n\nblood behaves like a Newtonian fluid. The latter is often assumed in large arteries \n\nwith a viscosity ?  ~ constant (often cited to be ~ 3.5 cP, or centiPoise) and the \n\nNavier\u2013Poisson equations to describe most blood flows. Plasma (whole blood \n\nminus cells) always behaves as a Newtonian fluid, with a viscosity ?  ~ 1.2cP \n\n(Humphrey and Delange, 2003). In capillaries, which are ~ 5\u20138 ? m in diameter, \n\nthe red blood cells go through one at a time, with plasma in between. In this case, \n\nthe blood should be treated as a two-phase flow \u2013 a solid and a fluid mixture \n\n(Humphrey and Delange, 2003). \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n141\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 \u2013 Illustration of Newtonian and Non-newtonian fluid behaviour. \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 5.3 \u2013 Illustration of single red blood cells and an aggregate of red blood cells, rouleaux \n\nphenomenon. \n\n \n\nBecause of its non-Newtonian behaviour, whole blood has been modelled using \n\nvarious relations.

Scaffold Vascularisation \n\n \n\nThe architecture and design of a scaffold has a profound effect on the rate of \n\nvascularisation after implantation (Almeida and B\u00e1rtolo, 2008; 2007). First, the \n\npore size of the scaffold is a critical determinant of blood-vessel ingrowth. Druecke \n\net al (2004) showed that vessel ingrowth was significantly faster in scaffolds with \n\npores greater than 250 \u00b5m than in those with smaller pores. However, it is not only \n\nthe pore size that is important for vascularisation: the interconnectivity of the pores \n\nis also significant because cell migration, and thus vascularisation, will be inhibited \n\nif pores are not interconnected, even if the scaffold porosity is high (Laschke et al, \n\n2006; Karageorgiou and Kaplan, 2005; Yang et al, 2001). \n\n \n\nThe flow of the biological medium through the scaffold is necessary to provide the \n\ncells with nutrients and oxygen and flush out the metabolic products (Vossenberg \n\net al, 2009). The success of cell attachment to the scaffold depends on the flow \n\nregime. High flows cause high shear stress (Martin and Vermette, 2005) and \n\nprevent attachment of cells to the scaffold surface, already attached cells may be \n\ndamaged or hindered in proliferation. Shear stress is also considered as an \n\nimportant parameter for in vivo systems. Wang and Tarbell (2000) found by \n\nexperiments for smooth-muscle cells that with increasing shear stress the \n\nproduction of prostaglandins increased. The results of Wang and Tarbell (2000) \n\nindicate that the blood flow rate plays an important role in the signal \n\ncommunication system from the blood vessels to the smooth muscle cells. \n\n \n\nWhen designing a scaffold, the shear stress that acts on the fibres of the scaffold \n\non which the cells grow must therefore be considered as a design parameter. \n\nShear stress is proportional to the velocity gradient and is a function of design \n\nparameters such as fibre diameter and distance between the fibre centres and \n\noperational variables such as fluid velocity (Vossenberg et al, 2009). \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n144 \n \n\nFor in vitro cultures such as in bioreactors, the cells are subjected to a continuous \n\nfluid flow of nutrients. It has been proven that the fluid flow induces a stress upon \n\nthe cells that are attached to the walls of the scaffolds, namely the wall shear \n\nstress. Higher values of wall shear stress decrease the cell\u2019s ability to attach to the \n\nwall of the scaffold, or eventually it also removes the attached cells and may kill \n\nthem when the values are too high. Lower values also don\u2019t offer the necessary \n\nstimuli that the cells need for a healthy proliferation and/or differentiation. In other \n\nwords, each cell type has its appropriate shear stress value. In the following table, \n\nshear stresses regarding optimum, critical and death values for several cell types \n\nare presented. Table 5.1 presents several Shear Stress values that are optimum, \n\nnatural or even lethal for cell cultures within bioreactors. \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Shear Stress values for cell cultures within bioreactors. \n\n \n\n  \n\nCell Type Process Shear Stress (Pa) References \n\nOsteoblasts \nOsteogenesis \n\n5x10-5 \u2013 optimum Cartmell et al (2003) \n\n5.7x10-2 \u2013 death Porter et al (2005) \n\nOsteocytes 0.5 a 1.5 \u2013 optimum Godara et al (2008) \n\nChondrocytes Chondrogenesis 0.1 \u2013 natural Schinagl et al (1999) \n\nSmooth Muscle Cells \nMyogenesis \n\n0.5 a 2.5 - optimum Martin and Vermette (2005) \n\nCardiomyocytes 0.24 \u2013 death Radisic et al (2008) \n\nHepatocytes \nOthers \n\n0.033 \u2013 optimum \nPark et al (2008) \n\n0.5 \u2013 critical \n\nCardiac Valve Cells 2.2 \u2013 optimum Martin and Vermette (2005) \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n145\n \n\n \n\n5.5. Vascular Simulation \n\n \n\nThe main goal for simulating the scaffold vascular behaviour is to evaluate the \n\nporosity dependence on both Wall Shear Stress and Shear Stress Rates on the \n\nsurface of the scaffold. These two parameters are the most critical due to the fact \n\nthat they contribute to the cell\u2019s performance regarding their proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation along the scaffold structure internally and externally. \n\n \n\nIf the scaffold is hosted within a biofluid rich environment, the first step is to obtain \n\nthe geometric representation the existing biofluid, in other words, the empty space \n\nwithin the scaffold unit (Figure 5.4).

Vascular Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n(a) Non-Triple Periodic Minimal Surfaces \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 and 5.8 illustrate the variation of the Shear Strain Rate and Wall Shear \n\nStress with the increase of the pore size of the scaffold. For both parameters, the \n\nscaffolds with \u201cCF\u201d present a sinusoidal behaviour with the increase of the pore \n\nsize of the scaffold, maintaining its average value constant. Regarding the Shear \n\nStrain Rate, as the pore size increases, the Shear Strain Rate increases initially \n\nand then decreases (\u201c4F\u201d pores), decreases and then begins to increase (\u201c12F\u201d \n\npores), while the \u201c8F\u201d pores also present a sinusoidal behaviour with a higher \n\namplitude and higher values compared with the Circular Pores. Regarding the \n\nWall Shear Stress, both the \u201c4F\u201d and \u201c12F\u201d pores present an almost linear \n\ndecreasing behaviour, having the \u201c12F\u201d pores higher values of Wall Shear Stress. \n\nThe \u201c8F\u201d pores presents a sinusoidal behaviour with both less amplitude and value \n\nof Wall Shear Stress compared to the \u201cCF\u201d pores. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.7 \u2013 Regular geometric scaffolds: variation of the Shear Strain Rate with the pore\u2019s \n\ndimensions. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n148 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.8 \u2013 Regular geometric scaffolds: variation of the Wall Shear Stress with the pore\u2019s \n\ndimensions. \n\n \n\nFigures 5.9 and 5.10 illustrate a micro-scale analysis of the Shear Strain Rate and \n\nWall Shear Stress for the regular geometric scaffolds with the increase of pore \n\nsize. On a micro-scale level, all 4 pore types have a similar behaviour regarding \n\nthe Shear Strain Rate and Wall Shear Stress. Figure 5.9 illustrates the variation of \n\nthe Shear Strain Rate for scaffolds with \u201c8F\u201d pores. Regarding this issue, no \n\nparticular superficial variation is observed, only that the higher values of Shear \n\nStrain Rate are located on the exterior of the scaffold. The lower values are \n\nverified in its interior. For the Wall Shear Stress for scaffolds with \u201c4F\u201d, the \n\ndifference in values between the interior and exterior of the scaffold are more \n\nsignificant (Figure 5.10). In other words, the cells located on the exterior surface of \n\nthe scaffold have a higher mechanobiological stimulation compared to the cells in \n\nthe interior of the scaffold. This will result in a low cell proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation inside the scaffold due to the lack of stimulation. \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n149\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9 \u2013 Regular geometric scaffolds: variation of the Shear Strain Rate with the pore\u2019s \n\ndimensions. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n150 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.10 \u2013 Regular geometric scaffolds: variation of the Wall Shear Stress with the pore\u2019s \n\ndimensions. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n151\n \n\n \n\nThe scaffold structures that were used for the Crushable Foam Simulations were \n\nalso subjected to vascular simulations. Bearing in mind, that only three geometries \n\nwere analysed, the present data isn\u2019t enough to present a behaviour curve of the \n\nShear Strain Rate and Wall Shear Stress as a function of pore size. Therefore only \n\na micro analysis was performed on the superficial behaviour of the scaffolds. \n\nSimilarly to the n faces per pore scaffolds, the Shear Strain Rate and Wall Shear \n\nStress aren\u2019t homogenous throughout the scaffold, presenting higher values on \n\nthe outer regions of the scaffold compared to the interior regions. \n\n \n\nRegarding the pore size variation, the results demonstrate that as the pore size \n\nincreases, lower is the difference in value for the Shear Strain rate and the Wall \n\nShear Stress between the outer and inner regions of the scaffold due to the \n\ndecrease in difficulty of the fluid flow to the interior of the scaffold. In this case, for \n\nthe 0/90\u00ba lay-down scaffolds, as the pore size increases, so does the vascular \n\nbehaviour of the scaffolds in spite of the decrease in mechanical performance, \n\nimproving the balance between the interior and exterior cellular stimulations. \n\nFigure 5.11 illustrates the variation of the Shear Strain Rate as the pore size \n\nincreases from 450 \u00b5m to 550 \u00b5m to 650 \u00b5m.

Figure 5.13 illustrates the variation of the Shear Strain Rate \n\ndue to the increase of thickness while Figure 5.14 illustrates the variation of the \n\nShear Strain Rate due to the increase of radius. From the figures, it is possible to \n\nverify that the Shear Strain Rate decreases with the geometries\u2019 thickness and \n\nincreases with the radius. In this case, it is possible to conclude that the increase \n\nof thickness lowers the Shear Strain Rate, resulting in a higher probability of \n\noccurring the rouleaux phenomenon. Regarding the radius variation, the \n\nprobability of occurring the rouleaux phenomenon decreases with the increase of \n\nradius. The Schwartz geometries have a similar behaviour for the Shear Strain \n\nRate. In conclusion, the best geometric option is to work with lower thicknesses \n\nand higher radius values. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.13 \u2013 Schoen surface: variation of the Shear Strain Rate with the variation of the thickness. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n155\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.14 \u2013 Schoen surface: variation of the Shear Strain Rate with the variation of the radius. \n\n \n\nFigures 5.15 and 5.16 illustrate the variation of the Wall Shear Stress in function of \n\nthe thickness variation of the geometries. Figure 5.15 illustrates the variation of the \n\nSchwartz geometry and Figure 5.16 illustrates the variation of the Schoen \n\ngeometry. From the figures illustrated below, it is possible to verify that the Wall \n\nShear Stress increases for the Schwartz geometry and decreases for the Schoen \n\ngeometries. The geometric variation regarding the radius variation has a similar \n\nbehaviour for the Wall Shear Stress. In conclusion, once the cell\u2019s shear stress is \n\nknown, it is possible to design the scaffolds with the ideal value so that neither do \n\nthe cells lack the adequate stimuli or are harmed due to the values being to high. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n156 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.15 \u2013 Schwartz surface: variation of the Wall Shear Stress with the variation of the \n\nthickness. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.16 \u2013 Schoen surface: variation of the Wall Shear Stress with the variation of the thickness. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n157\n \n\nA micro-scale analysis of both geometries was also performed for the vascular \n\nsimulations.

Results of both geometries show that the Shear Strain Rate \n\ndecreases with the geometries\u2019 thickness and increases with the radius. \n\nRegarding the Wall Shear Stress, it increases for the Schwartz geometry and \n\ndecreases for the Schoen geometries as the geometries\u2019 thickness increases. The \n\ngeometric variation regarding the radius variation has a similar behaviour for the \n\nWall Shear Stress. Results of the variation of the Shear Strain Stress on the \n\nscaffold\u2019s surface show that both geometries present a more homogenous \n\nvariation with lower geometric values. Regarding the Wall Shear Stress, the \n\nSchoen geometries present a more homogenous variation with lower thickness \n\nvalues.

The Wall Shear Stress increases with the increase of \n\nthickness maintaining a homogenous distribution on the scaffold. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n163\n \n\n \n\nChapter 6 \u2013 Topological Optimisation of \n\nScaffolds for Tissue Engineering \n\n6. Topological Optimisation \n\n \n\n6.1. Design Optimisation of Scaffolds in Tissue Engineering \n\n \n\nThe classical problem in engineering design consists in finding the optimum \n\ngeometric configuration of a structure that maximizes a given cost objective \n\nfunction with boundary conditions and constraints. Structural optimisation can be \n\nclassified as follows (Lee, 2007; Hsu and Hsu, 2005): \n\n \n\n? Size optimisation; \n\n? Shape optimisation; \n\n? Topology optimisation. \n\n \n\nIn size optimisation (Figure 6.1.b), only the cross section of a structure is \n\noptimised. A typical size feature of a given structure, such as the thickness of a \n\nbeam, is either increased or decreased in order to improve its performance. In \n\nshape optimisation (Figure 6.1.c), the shape of the structure is obtained by \n\nchanging the shape of the used components with other components of different \n\nshape, in order to improve a desired variable within a system. In topology \n\noptimisation (Figure 6.1.d), the shape and connectivity of the domain are both \n\ndesign variables. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n164 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 \u2013 Types of engineering optimisations: a) original part b) part after size optimisation c) \n\npart after shape optimisation and d) part after topological optimisation. \n\n \n\nTopology optimisation provides the first design concept of the structure\u2019s materials \n\ndistribution. Its goal is to minimise the structure compliance while satisfying the \n\nconstraints of volume removal. As the structure compliance is twice the strain \n\nenergy, the objective function of minimising structure compliance is equivalent to \n\nminimising strain energy (Kruijf et al, 2007; Rozvany, 2001). \n\n \n\nIn spite of several attempts to define optimised scaffolds (Podshivalov et al, 2009; \n\n2008; Holdstein and Fischer, 2008; Wettergeen et al, 2008; 2005a; 2005b), there \n\nis no work correlating both porosity and mechanical properties with topological \n\ninformation. As described in Chapter 2, scaffolds must be highly porous structures \n\nbut also effective from a mechanical point of view. This is a complex issue, \n\nfundamental for tissue engineering applications and not yet fully addressed. This \n\nchapter proposes an optimised strategy to obtain scaffolds with an appropriate \n\ntopology maximizing both porosity and mechanical behaviour. The methodology \n\nproposed in this chapter is of simple implementation and does not require high \n\ncomputational calculation time. \n\n \n\n  \n\na) \n\nb) \n\nc) \nd) \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n165\n \n\n \n\n6.2. Topological Optimisation \n\n \n\nTopological optimisation, aiming to find the best use of material according to a \n\n\u201cmaximum-stiffness\u201d design, requires neither parameters nor the explicit definition \n\nof optimisation variables. The objective function is predefined, as are the state \n\nvariables (constrained dependent variables), and the design variables \n\n(independent variables to be optimised). The topological optimisation problem \n\nrequires the problem definition (material properties, model and loads), the \n\nobjective function (the function to be minimized or maximized), and the state \n\nvariables corresponding to the percentage of material to be removed (Neches and \n\nCisilino, 2008; Ansola et al, 2007; Kruijf et al, 2007; Hsu and Hsu, 2005; Bends\u00f8e \n\nand Sigmund, 2003; Rozvany, 2001; Bends\u00f8e, 1989; Bends\u00f8e and Kikuchi, \n\n1988). \n\n \n\nFrom a mechanical point of view, the goal of topological optimisation is to minimise \n\nthe total compliance, which is proportional to the strain energy.

Topological Results and Discussion \n\n \n\nTwo different analyses were carried out: \n\n \n\n? Topological optimisation of an initial solid block under different constraints; \n\n? Topological optimisation of an initial solid block with loading and constraint \n\nsurfaces defined based on geometrical information obtained from real \n\nbiological tissues (Bio-surface constrained optimisation of a solid block \n\nelement). \n\n \n\nEach block was assumed to be made of PCL (elastic modulus of 400 MPa and \n\nPoisson\u2019s ratio of 0.33). The optimisation scheme described in the previous \n\nsections was implemented using the finite element software Ansys. A total number \n\n100 iterations for each calculation was considered and the convergence tolerance \n\nparameter for each calculation was assumed to be 1E-4. \n\n \n\n(a) Topological optimisation of an initial solid block \n\n \n\nA solid cubic block with 5 mm of size was considered. A mesh of 15625 cubic solid \n\nelements of 0.2 mm of size was used to model the block (Figure 6.4). The \n\noptimisation goal is to obtain the best material distribution within the geometric \n\nspace that corresponds to the solid block, maximizing the mechanical behaviour of \n\nthe construct based on an imposed porosity value. Different levels of porosity were \n\nconsidered (10 % to 90 % with increments of 10). The block element was \n\nassumed to have a linear elastic behaviour, so strain values of 0.1 were simulated \n\nby imposing a corresponding displacement according to the strain direction \n\nconsidered. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n171\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.4 \u2013 Illustration of the Meshed model of the scaffold. \n\n \n\nBased on the strain locations, different optimisation scenarios were considered as \n\nfollows (Figure 6.5): \n\n \n\n?

Both scenarios \n\nonly present 2 valid topological solutions for 80 % and 90 % porosity. By \n\ncomparing both, the first scenario presents higher biological performance due to \n\nits interconnectivity in 2 directions instead of just 1 in the second scenario. \n\n \n\nFigures 6.9 and 6.10 illustrate the results for scenarios 9 and 12. These 2 \n\nscenarios present 4 valid topological solutions for 60 %, 70 %, 80 % and 90 % of \n\nporosity. In this case, scenario 12 presents the best results due to the fact that all \n\n4 solutions present pore interconnectivity in all 3 directions, when compared to \n\nscenario 9 which only 3 present pore interconnectivity in all directions. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.8 presents 5 valid topological solutions for scenario 8, ranging from 50 % \n\nto 90 % in porosity. All 5 solutions present pore interconnectivity in all 3 directions. \n\n \n\nThe scenario 13 is the scenario that presents the highest number valid topological \n\nsolutions (Figure 6.11). In this case, all solutions present pore interconnectivity in \n\nall 3 directions ranging from 30 % to 90 %. \n\n \n\nFrom the results, it is possible to conclude that the best given topological \n\noptimised scenario is the 6th, which corresponds to the scenario with constraints \n\non the edges in 1 direction and the displacements on the edges but in 2 directions. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n184 \n \n\n \n\n(b) Bio-surface constrained optimisation of a solid block element \n\n \n\nThis approach is based on \u00b5CT data of real biological tissues to create the loading \n\nand constraint surfaces of the scaffold during the topological optimisation process. \n\nContrary to the previous case, where all faces of a block were considered as \n\nadmissible loading and constraint surfaces, in this approach only specific regions \n\nare considered. The goal of this approach is to obtain biomimetic optimised \n\nelements. In order to perform this kind of optimisation, a trabecular bone region \n\nwas considered. The corresponding STL model is shown in Figure 6.12.a. The \n\nSTL file model obtained from the \u00b5CT data was analysed and non-valid triangles \n\nwere removed and errors (overlapping, degenerated triangles, etc.) corrected \n\n(Figure 6.12.b). Once analysed and corrected, datum plane boundaries were \n\ncreated in order to define the scaffold element boundary space (Figure 6.13). The \n\nfollowing step involves the intersection between the datum planes and the STL \n\nmodel to define the loading and constraint curves (Figure 6.14) to define the \n\nsurfaces for optimisation (Figure 6.15).

Conclusions \n\n \n\n7.1. Concluding Remarks \n\n \n\nScaffolds are critical elements for tissue engineering applications, as they provide \n\nthe necessary support for tissue regeneration in an organised way. As described \n\nin Chapter 1, scaffolds should be biocompatible, biodegradable, with appropriate \n\nporosity, pore structure and pore distribution, on top of presenting both surface \n\nand structural compatibility. These characteristics are usually difficult to achieve, \n\ni.e., it is quite difficult to design a construct with both high porosity (a critical \n\nproperty for vascularisation purposes) and high mechanical properties. \n\n \n\nDesign strategies to produce optimized scaffolds represent a critical topic of \n\nresearch in the field of tissue engineering. This is an emergent domain covered by \n\nthis research study. \n\n \n\nThe state-of-the-art in tissue engineering, biofabrication and scaffold design, \n\nbased on numerical simulations to determine optimum scaffold design parameters, \n\nis fully addressed. The knowledge gathered through this literature review \n\n(Chapters 1, 2 and 3) was fundamental to develop a computational strategy for \n\nComputer Aided Design of Scaffolds based on CAD data, the mechanical models, \n\nand the finite element method, in order to investigate the following issues: the \n\nmechanical behaviour (Chapter 4), the vascular behaviour (Chapter 5) and to \n\noptimise the scaffold\u2019s topology (Chapter 6). \n\n \n\nScaffolds can be considered as a LEGO structure formed by an association of \n\nsmall elementary units or blocks. Two families of elementary scaffold units were \n\nconsidered: i) Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces, and ii) Triple periodic minimal \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n196 \n \n\nsurfaces (Schwartz and Schoen surfaces). Both families of scaffold topologies \n\nwere evaluated as a function of porosity, in terms of mechanical and vascular \n\nperformance. Additionally, all families were experimentally validated from a \n\nmanufacturing view. The use of these different scaffold families enables the \n\nfabrication of fully interconnected scaffolds through additive biofabrication \n\ntechniques. Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces were evaluated in terms of pore \n\ntopology and pore distribution, while the Triple periodic minimal surfaces were \n\nevaluated in terms of two geometric design parameters (radius and thickness \n\nvalues). \n\n \n\nFrom a mechanical point of view, it is possible to observe that: \n\n \n\n? By increasing the porosity, the mechanical properties decrease in a non-\n\nlinear way. \n\n? The influence of the number of pores per face, on the mechanical \n\nproperties of Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces, was also determined. For \n\na given level of porosity, by increasing the number of pores per face, the \n\nmechanical properties increase in a non-linear way. \n\n? The relationship between porosity and mechanical properties depends on \n\nthe architecture of the pore. Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces that \n\npresent better behaviour are the scaffolds with \u201cCF\u201d pores below a critical \n\nvalue of 50 % porosity, and the scaffolds with \u201c4F\u201d pores above 50 % \n\nporosity. On the other way, the Triple periodic minimal surface scaffolds \n\npresenting the best results are the ones obtained with the Schwartz \n\nsurfaces. These surfaces, for the same level of porosity and different radius \n\nvalues, enable to produce structures either with high mechanical behaviour \n\nor low mechanical behaviour. \n\n? A relationship between the geometric parameters (radius and thickness) of \n\nTriple periodic minimal surfaces and its mechanical properties was obtained \n\non a macro-scale level. For both Schwartz and Schoen surfaces, the \n\nmechanical properties improve with the increase in its thickness in a non-\n\nlinear way. Regarding the radius variation for the Schoen surfaces the \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n197\n \n\nmechanical properties decrease in a non-linear way as the radius \n\nincreases. \n\n? On a micro-scale level, for both Schwartz and Schoen surfaces, the scaffold \n\nstructures present a more homogenous tensile distribution for lower \n\nthickness values. Regarding the radius variation for Schwartz surfaces, \n\nthere is no significant tensile stress variation with an increase of radius, \n\nwhile Schoen geometries present a more homogenous tensile distribution \n\nfor lower radius values. \n\n? On another level, the Von Misses tensile stresses and the normal xx?  \n\nstress variation, according to the node\u2019s geometric \u201cX\u201d position in the \n\nSchoen surface, was determined. Results show that both tensile stresses \n\nare similar, which means that the other tensile or shear stresses are less \n\nsignificant. It is also possible to observe that the geometric transition, from \n\nthe corner channel to the central sphere, is characterized by a decrease on \n\nthe average tensile stresses. \n\n? In order to validate the proposed mechanical simulations, a comparison \n\nbetween numerical and experimental data was performed. In this case, a \n\ncrushable foam behaviour was adopted for the numerical simulations. This \n\ncomparison was undertaken for three pore sizes (450 \u00b5m, 550 \u00b5m and 650 \n\n\u00b5m). Results demonstrate that the scaffold with a pore size of 450 \u00b5m \n\npresents the best numerical results when compared to the experimental \n\ncompressive data. The plots from the numerical simulations illustrate that \n\nan unbalanced meshed body results in an unbalanced bulging \n\nphenomenon, which influences the densification process. This phenomenon \n\ncan justify the deviations verified between the numerical stress-strain \n\ncurves and the experimental ones. In order to obtain a better agreement \n\nbetween the numerical stress-strain curves and the experimental ones, the \n\nnumerical parameters of all three structures need to be optimised and a \n\nsymmetric meshed body needs to be defined. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n198 \n \n\nTwo critical parameters were considered in the vascular simulations for both \n\nscaffold families, the Shear Stress Rate and the Wall Shear Stress. From the \n\nresults, it is possible to observe that: \n\n \n\n? For Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces, on a macro-scale level, both \n\nparameters present a sinusoidal behaviour with the increase of the pore \n\nsize, maintaining its average value constant. \n\n? For Non-triple periodic minimal surfaces, on a micro-scale level, both \n\nparameters present a similar behaviour with the increase in pore size, being \n\nmore significant for the Wall Shear Stress. With the increase in the pore \n\nsize, both structures present a more homogenous distribution of values with \n\nsmaller deviations between the highest and lowest values. It is also \n\npossible to observe that higher values are located on the exterior of the \n\nscaffold and lower values in its interior. \n\n? For the scaffold structures with pore sizes of 450 \u00b5m, 550 \u00b5m and 650 \u00b5m, \n\nboth parameters present a similar behaviour. Results demonstrate that as \n\nthe pore size increases, the difference is lower in value for the Shear Strain \n\nrate, and the Wall Shear Stress between the outer and inner regions of the \n\nscaffold, due to the decrease in the difficulty of the fluid to flow to the \n\ninterior of the scaffold. \n\n? For the Shear Strain Rate of Triple periodic minimal surfaces, it is possible \n\nto observe that the Shear Strain Rate decreases with the geometries\u2019 \n\nthickness and increases with the radius, for the Schoen surfaces. The \n\nSchwartz geometries have a similar behaviour for the Shear Strain Rate. In \n\nconclusion, the best geometric option is the scaffold with lower thickness \n\nand higher radius values. \n\n? For the Wall Shear Stress of Triple periodic minimal surfaces, it is possible \n\nto observe that the Wall Shear Stress increases for the Schwartz geometry \n\nand decreases for the Schoen geometries, with the increase in thickness. \n\nThe geometric variation regarding the radius variation has a similar \n\nbehaviour compared to the thickness. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n199\n \n\n? Regarding the Wall Shear Stress of Triple periodic minimal surfaces on a \n\nmicro-scale, the Schoen geometries present a more homogenous variation \n\nwith lower thickness values, for both interior and exterior regions of the \n\nscaffold. The most significant variation is presented with the thickness \n\nvariation of the Schwartz geometries, so the Wall Shear Stress increases \n\nwith the increase of thickness maintaining a homogenous distribution on the \n\nexterior region of the scaffold. Regarding the interior region of the scaffold, \n\nit tends to decrease with a homogenous distribution. \n\n \n\nRegarding the topological optimizations, two types of analysis were carried out: \n\n \n\n? The topological optimisation of an initial solid block element: \n\nIn this analysis, several scenarios were considered, combining \n\nloading and constraint conditions on vertices, edges and faces. In \n\nthis case, two types of design models were obtained, invalid and \n\nvalid scaffold models. Design models that present a shell structure or \n\nnon-interconnected designs are considered invalid scaffold models, \n\nwhile design models that present interconnectivity in 1, 2 or 3 \n\ndirections are considered valid scaffold models. \n\nFrom the results, it is possible to conclude that the best topological \n\nscenario corresponds to a scenario with constraints on the edges in 1 \n\ndirection and displacements on the edges in the other 2 directions, \n\nobtaining 7 valid scaffold design models with interconnectivity in all 3 \n\ndirections. \n\n \n\n? The bio-surface constrained optimisation of a solid block element: \n\nThe initial external topology of the \u00b5CT data, which corresponds to a \n\nstructure of a well-defined mechanical behaviour and porosity level, \n\nis the starting point of an optimisation scheme that enables to obtain \n\nconstructs with different levels of porosity and mechanical properties, \n\naccording to the required applications, based on biomimetic external \n\nsurfaces. \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n200 \n \n\nThis particular topological optimisation scheme uses the surface \n\nboundaries to produce novel models with different characteristics, \n\nwhich are different from the initial \u00b5CT models. This approach \n\nenables to produce valid biomimetic scaffold topologies for tissue \n\nengineering applications. \n\n \n\n7.2. Future Works \n\n \n\nPossible future directions for research following on this thesis can be undertaken \n\nin two main areas, namely numerical and experimental. \n\n \n\nThe numerical work that needs further investigation: \n\n \n\n? Including viscoelastic behaviour models in the numerical simulations; \n\n? Introducing degradation models in both the mechanical and vascular \n\nsimulations; \n\n? Combining both mechanical and vascular simulations in order to obtain a \n\nmore complete understanding of tissue engineering scaffolds for specific \n\ndomains, such as in perfusion bioreactors; \n\n? Including cellular proliferation and behaviour models allowing numerical \n\nsimulations of both cells and constructs. In this case, the degradation effect \n\nupon the polymeric and/or ceramic scaffolds should be considered. \n\n \n\nThe experimental work to be carried out: \n\n \n\n? Validate the vascular simulations undertaken in this research work; \n\n? Undergoing combined experimental mechanical and vascular stimulations \n\nupon the scaffolds in order to validate the numerical simulations; \n\n? Develop cellular proliferation and behaviour models to be used in numerical \n\nsimulations. \n\n \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n201\n \n\nDuring this work, new research directions started to be explored and implemented \n\nat Centre for Rapid and Sustainable Product Development, with support of the \n\nPortuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), the Portuguese \n\nAgency for Innovation (ADI), the Ciencia Y Tecnologia Para El Desarrollo \n\n(CYTED) and the Marie Curie European Projects (FP7), as stated before. These \n\nprojects are based in the deep understanding achieved during this thesis. \n\n \n\nSeveral questions have been answered through this thesis, but several others \n\nhave been proposed and must be solved in the future by further research studies. \n\nIn other words, a PhD thesis is just another step in one\u2019s academic life in order to \n\ncontinue undergoing research and investigation at a different level. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications \n\n \n\n \n\n202 \n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nSmart Design of Scaffolds Obtained by Biofabrication for Tissue Engineering Applications\n\n \n\n \n\n203\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAdachi, T., Osako, Y., Tanaka, M., Hojo, M. and Hollister, S.J.
