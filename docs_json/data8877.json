Os \n\nn\u00edveis de CO2 atmosf\u00e9rico aumentaram de cerca de 280 ppM (partes por milh\u00e3o) para \n\ncerca de 390 ppM em 2010 e prev\u00ea-se que continuem a subir, podendo atingir valores \n\nacima dos 1000 ppM em 2100. Como a atmosfera e os oceanos funcionam como \n\nsistemas interligados, as altera\u00e7\u00f5es que ocorrem num v\u00e3o ter consequ\u00eancias no outro. \n\nAssim, com o aumento do CO2 na atmosfera, a press\u00e3o parcial do CO2 (?CO2) da \u00e1gua \n\ndo mar tamb\u00e9m aumenta, o que, por sua vez, conduz a uma altera\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica do \n\ncarbonato, resultando na acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua (redu\u00e7\u00e3o do pH).  \n\nAtualmente, o pH m\u00e9dio das \u00e1guas dos oceanos \u00e9 cerca de 8,2, uma d\u00e9cima abaixo dos \n\nvalores pr\u00e9-industriais. Tendo como base os cen\u00e1rios realistas para as futuras emiss\u00f5es \n\nde CO2, prev\u00ea-se que o pH possa diminuir ainda mais 0,3 - 0,4 unidades at\u00e9 2100.   \n\nEstas varia\u00e7\u00f5es v\u00e3o ter graves consequ\u00eancias ecol\u00f3gicas no planeta Terra, podendo \n\ncausar uma perda global de biodiversidade, dist\u00farbios nos processos dos ecossistemas \n\ne redu\u00e7\u00e3o de bens e servi\u00e7os ecol\u00f3gicos \u00fateis ao Homem. Nos organismos marinhos, as \n\nconsequ\u00eancias poder\u00e3o ser dr\u00e1sticas, como por exemplo, diminui\u00e7\u00e3o das taxas de \n\ncalcifica\u00e7\u00e3o, altera\u00e7\u00f5es de processos fisiol\u00f3gicos e, tamb\u00e9m, varia\u00e7\u00f5es no \n\ncomportamento de alguns peixes. Uma vez que as fases iniciais de vida s\u00e3o mais \n\nvulner\u00e1veis \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as do ambiente, o mais prov\u00e1vel \u00e9 que os efeitos da acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsejam detetados mais facilmente nestes est\u00e1gios do ciclo de vida. \u00c9 portanto, \n\nfundamental compreender as consequ\u00eancias de um meio mais \u00e1cido em larvas e \n\njuvenis, que, por sua vez, se podem refletir nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es adultas. \n\nA maioria dos peixes de recife s\u00e3o caracterizados por possu\u00edrem um ciclo de vida com \n\nduas fases: uma na qual o est\u00e1gio larvar pel\u00e1gico se desloca para \u00e1guas abertas, longe \n\ndo recife, e outra envolvendo o recrutamento para \u00e1guas costeiras para assentar, \n\nvivendo aqui o resto da sua vida adulta. Outrora, pensava-se que a dispers\u00e3o larvar era \n\npassiva e a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o do s\u00edtio de assentamento determinada totalmente pelas \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\niii \n \n\ncorrentes oce\u00e2nicas. Hoje sabe-se que as larvas exibem nata\u00e7\u00e3o ativa e orientada, \n\npodendo, deste modo, controlar a sua dispers\u00e3o e assentamento.  \n\nPara se orientarem no meio pel\u00e1gico, as larvas, recorrem essencialmente a pistas \n\nolfativas e auditivas. Para al\u00e9m da orienta\u00e7\u00e3o, os odores, s\u00e3o bastante \u00fateis na dete\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ne evas\u00e3o a predadores. No que diz respeito aos sons dos recifes, estes podem ser tanto \n\nde origem abi\u00f3tica (movimento da \u00e1gua, rebentamento das ondas, chuva na superf\u00edcie \n\nda \u00e1gua e eventos geol\u00f3gicos) como bi\u00f3tica (v\u00e1rios organismos como peixes e \n\ninvertebrados), funcionando como uma pista bastante complexa. Estes sons podem \n\nvariar com a hora do dia, provocando a desloca\u00e7\u00e3o larvar em dire\u00e7\u00e3o aos recifes \n\ndurante a noite, com o objectivo de assentamento. Durante o dia, as larvas afastam-se \n\ndos recifes, de modo a evitarem predadores associados a estes e para se alimentarem.  \n\nEstudos recentes, onde foram utilizados peixes de recifes de coral, j\u00e1 demonstraram \n\nque o aumento do CO2 e a consequente diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do pH modificam negativamente o \n\ncomportamento e as respostas sensoriais das fases iniciais de vida destes peixes, \n\nalterando as suas respostas a pistas olfativas, auditivas e at\u00e9 mesmo visuais. No \n\nentanto, pouco se sabe sobre a resposta de larvas de peixes temperados \u00e0 acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndo Oceano prevista para as pr\u00f3ximas d\u00e9cadas. \n\nAssim, os objetivos deste estudo centraram-se na verifica\u00e7\u00e3o das influ\u00eancias que os \n\nbaixos n\u00edveis de pH podem ter no comportamento e nos sistemas sensoriais envolvidos \n\nna sobreviv\u00eancia das popula\u00e7\u00f5es larvares de peixes de recifes rochosos temperados. \n\nMais especificamente, verificou-se se a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o afeta a resposta das larvas a pistas \n\nolfativas pertencentes a predadores prov\u00e1veis de serem evitados aquando da procura \n\nde locais de assentamento e, tamb\u00e9m, a pistas auditivas utilizadas, possivelmente, na \n\nprocura desses mesmos locais. Para esse efeito, larvas selvagens de peixe-rei (Atherina \n\npresbyter) e de caboz-da-areia (Pomatoschistus pictus) foram capturadas e expostas a \n\ndois tratamentos de pH, ~ 8,10 (tratamento controlo) e ~ 7,6 (tratamento acidificado). \n\nO tratamento controlo foi estabelecido atrav\u00e9s da difus\u00e3o do ar envolvente na \u00e1gua \n\ndos aqu\u00e1rios e o tratamento acidificado simulado atrav\u00e9s do bombeamento de CO2 na \n\n\u00e1gua, com o aux\u00edlio de um sistema de controladores de pH eletr\u00f3nicos que \n\nmantiveram o pH ao n\u00edvel desejado.   \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\niv \n \n\nPosteriormente, as larvas de ambos os tratamentos, foram submetidas a experi\u00eancias \n\nonde se utilizaram odores de potenciais predadores (experi\u00eancia de odores) e sons \n\ndiurnos dos recifes pertencentes \u00e0 mesma localiza\u00e7\u00e3o de onde as larvas foram \n\ncapturadas (experi\u00eancia de sons). \n\nPara a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o das experi\u00eancias de odores, foi utilizada uma c\u00e2mara com dois canais \n\nde escolha que recebia \u00e1gua de duas fontes diferentes, tratadas com pistas olfativas \n\ndiferentes. Aqui, as larvas eram capazes de nadar livremente e escolher qualquer um \n\ndos lados da c\u00e2mara. No in\u00edcio de cada ensaio, uma larva foi colocada no centro da \n\nextremidade a jusante da c\u00e2mara e, depois de 2 minutos de aclimatiza\u00e7\u00e3o, a posi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda larva na c\u00e2mara foi registada a cada 5 segundos, durante 2 minutos. O peixe-rei foi \n\ntestado com pistas olfativas de robalo (Dicentrarchus labrax) e o caboz-da-areia com \n\ncom pistas olfativas do blenideo Lipophrys trigloides. \n\nNas experi\u00eancias de sons, utilizou-se uma c\u00e2mara de escolha auditiva, a qual consiste \n\nnuma c\u00e2mara tubular de acr\u00edlico inserida dentro de um aqu\u00e1rio de vidro acusticamente \n\nisolado. Numa das extremidades da c\u00e2mara havia uma coluna submersa que emitia os \n\nsons do recife e que foi trocada para o lado oposto, a meio de cada s\u00e9rie de ensaios. \n\nNo in\u00edcio de cada ensaio, uma larva foi libertada no centro da c\u00e2mara e, ap\u00f3s 1 minuto \n\nde aclimatiza\u00e7\u00e3o, a sua posi\u00e7\u00e3o foi registada.  \n\nAs larvas de peixe-rei e de caboz-da-areia responderam de modo diferente aos testes \n\nolfactivos. Ao contrario do que se esperava, as larvas de peixe-rei criadas em condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncontrolo, n\u00e3o evitaram a pista odor\u00edfera do predador (robalo). Tal comportamento \n\npode ter tido tr\u00eas causas diferentes: (1) as larvas de peixe-rei poderiam ainda ser na\u00efve \n\na qualquer pista produzida pelo robalo adulto, devido \u00e0 aus\u00eancia de contacto com este; \n\n(2) \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que as larvas de peixe-rei sejam demasiado pequenas para pertencerem \n\n\u00e0 alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o do robalo adulto, n\u00e3o representando este, portanto, uma grande \n\namea\u00e7a como predador; (3) a \u00e1gua do robalo veio de um aqu\u00e1rio onde a \u00e1gua circula \n\npor uma sistema de tanques com outras esp\u00e9cies, podendo, assim, o odor do robalo \n\nestar dilu\u00eddo noutros odores. Quando as larvas de peixe-rei criadas em condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nbaixas de pH foram testadas, a resposta sensorial olfativa ao predador manteve-se \n\nsemelhante.  \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\nv \n \n\nRelativamente \u00e0s larvas de caboz-da-areia, quando se testaram as que foram criadas \n\nem pH controlo, tamb\u00e9m n\u00e3o se verificou que tivessem evitado a pista olfativa do \n\npredador (L.-trigloides). Esta aparente aus\u00eancia de resposta est\u00e1, provavelmente, \n\nrelacionada com o facto do L. trigloides n\u00e3o se alimentar de caboz-da-areia. Em \n\ncontrapartida, a resposta comportamental, perante a pista odor\u00edfera do predador, das \n\nlarvas criadas em condi\u00e7\u00f5es acidificadas de pH, mudou significativamente, evitando, \n\nestas, fortemente o odor do L. trigloides (81% do tempo). Este comportamento pode \n\nrepresentar uma defici\u00eancia sensorial, estando as larvas a responder a um odor ao \n\nqual n\u00e3o deveriam reagir, porque o L. trigloides n\u00e3o representa um perigo para o \n\ncaboz-da-areia. Isto sugere que os baixos n\u00edveis de pH podem causar danos no \n\nmecanismo olfativo larvar, resultando num erro onde ocorre uma confus\u00e3o na dete\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde pistas olfativas importantes para a sobreviv\u00eancia de larvas de algumas esp\u00e9cies de \n\nrecife.  \n\nComo foi observado nos testes olfativos, as duas esp\u00e9cies-alvo responderam de \n\nmaneira diferente aos sons de recife emitidos. Contrariamente ao que se esperava, as \n\nlarvas de peixe-rei criadas tanto no tratamento controlo, como no acidificado, n\u00e3o \n\nresponderam aos sons de recife. Possivelmente, as suas larvas n\u00e3o necessitam de \n\nresponder aos sons dos recifes, isto porque o peixe-rei tem um ciclo de vida particular, \n\nem que o adulto desova em \u00e1guas costeiras e rasas e a larva eclode muito bem \n\ndesenvolvida, permanecendo no mesmo s\u00edtio, em cardumes, para depois se afastar da \n\ncosta, em adulto. Adicionalmente, esta \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie de vida totalmente pel\u00e1gica. \n\nAssim, o peixe-rei, n\u00e3o necessita de localizar um recife para se estabelecer. Outra \n\npossibilidade pode estar relacionada com o facto dos sons utilizados neste estudo \n\nestarem fora da sensibilidade auditiva deste peixe, o que n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel verificar \n\ndevido \u00e0 car\u00eancia do aparelho apropriado para a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o do m\u00e9todo Auditory \n\nBrainstem Response (ABR), uma t\u00e9cnica eletrofisiol\u00f3gica que permite definir limites de \n\naudi\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nAs laravas de caboz-da-areia criadas em condi\u00e7\u00f5es controlo evitaram fortemente os \n\nsons diurnos dos recifes. Tais resultados est\u00e3o de acordo com estudos anteriormente \n\nrealizados, onde foi demonstrado que, normalmente, durante o dia as larvas afastam-\n\nse dos recifes a fim de evitarem os predadores do recife e se alimentarem e durante a \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\nvi \n \n\nnoite movem-se em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao recife para assentarem. Quando se testaram as larvas \n\ncriadas em tratamento pH 7,6, o seu comportamento mudou significativamente. As \n\nlarvas inverteram ou perderam as suas capacidades auditivas, n\u00e3o apresentando \n\nqualquer resposta aos sons. Estes resultados sugerem que n\u00edveis elevados de \n\nacidifica\u00e7\u00e3o podem comprometer comportamentos auditivos fundamentais \u00e0 \n\nsobreviv\u00eancia destas larvas e que as respostas a pistas auditivas n\u00e3o ir\u00e3o compensar a \n\npotencial perda de outros sentidos, tais como o olfativo. \n\nA hip\u00f3tese de adapta\u00e7\u00e3o dos peixes a um ambiente acidificado tem sido pouco \n\nestudada mas, n\u00e3o deve ser posta de lado. No entanto, \u00e9 pouco prov\u00e1vel que muitas \n\ndas esp\u00e9cies marinhas possuam varia\u00e7\u00f5es gen\u00e9ticas adaptadas a estas r\u00e1pidas \n\nmudan\u00e7as. Provavelmente, s\u00f3 as esp\u00e9cies com tempos de gera\u00e7\u00e3o muito r\u00e1pidos v\u00e3o \n\nser capazes de acompanhar o ritmo da mudan\u00e7a e adaptar-se. \u00c9 importante que, de \n\nfuturo, se fa\u00e7am experi\u00eancias de longa dura\u00e7\u00e3o (com v\u00e1rias gera\u00e7\u00f5es), isto porque \n\npode ser que ocorra aclimatiza\u00e7\u00e3o e/ou adapta\u00e7\u00e3o. Com peixes, \u00e9 mais dif\u00edcil realizar \n\neste tipo de experi\u00eancias, mas pode-se, pelo menos, fazer com a descend\u00eancia de \n\nprogenitores criados em ambiente acidificado, como j\u00e1 tem vindo a ser feito por \n\noutros investigadores.  \n\nO presente estudo forneceu evid\u00eancias de que acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do Oceano pode afetar \n\nsignificativamente as respostas sensoriais (olfativas e auditivas) de larvas de alguns \n\npeixes de recife temperado, causando impactes potencialmente negativos para a \n\nsobreviv\u00eancia larvar e para reposi\u00e7\u00e3o e sustentabilidade de popula\u00e7\u00f5es. \n\nEste foi o primeiro estudo que verificou os efeitos resultantes do aumento das \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de CO2 nos oceanos no comportamento sensorial de peixes de recifes \n\ntemperados, tendo sido um trabalho de grande import\u00e2ncia nesta tem\u00e1tica. N\u00e3o \n\nobstante, \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria mais investiga\u00e7\u00e3o nesta \u00e1rea, tanto na realiza\u00e7\u00e3o do mesmo \n\nestudo em mais esp\u00e9cies (porque nem todas as esp\u00e9cies de larvas de peixes \n\nrespondem da mesma forma \u00e0s altera\u00e7\u00f5es do pH), como no aperfei\u00e7oamento dos \n\nm\u00e9todos experimentais, com o objetivo de compreender melhor as repercuss\u00f5es \n\ndesta amea\u00e7a. Adicionalmente, uma vez que aumento global da temperatura ir\u00e1 atuar \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\nvii \n \n\nsimultaneamente com a acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o do Oceano, seria tamb\u00e9m de grande interesse \n\nestudar os efeitos da intera\u00e7\u00e3o entre estes dois fatores. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: acidifica\u00e7\u00e3o oce\u00e2nica; respostas auditivas; respostas olfativas; \n\ncomportamento sensorial; larvas de peixes de recife  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\nviii \n \n\nAbstract \n\nDue to anthropogenic activity, atmospheric CO2 levels have been increasing since the \n\nlast century. Consequently, the average levels of surface pH in the ocean is drastically \n\ndropping, affecting marine life, including changes in fish behaviour. In many coastal \n\nmarine fish the selection of the adult habitat occurs in the pelagic larval phase, relying \n\non hearing and olfaction for orientation as well as for predator avoidance and \n\ncommunication. In the present study, the effects of ocean acidification in the ability of \n\nfish larvae to detect olfactory cues from potential predators and auditory cues from \n\nadult habitats (reefs) were tested. Larvae of sand-smelt (Atherina presbyter) and \n\npainted goby (Pomatoschistus pictus) were reared in a control CO2 treatment (pH~8.10) \n\nand in a high CO2 treatment (pH~7.6). Later, fishes were subjected to odour \n\nexperiments in a two channel choice flume and to sound experiments in an auditory \n\nchoice chamber. Sand-smelt larvae reared in both control and acidified treatment did \n\nnot show any response to olfactory cue and to reef sounds. Larval painted goby reared \n\nin high CO2 treatment and exposed to olfactory cue, strongly avoided the cue, what did \n\nnot occur in larvae reared in control CO2 treatment. Regarding to sound tests, painted \n\ngoby larvae from control treatment discriminated reef noises, as expected, however \n\nthis behavior was absent in larvae reared in an acidified treatment. This study provid \n\nevidence that ocean acidification might affect the sensorial responses (olfactory and \n\nauditory) of larvae in some temperate reef fish, with potentially injurious impacts on \n\ntheir survival. \n\n \n\nKey Words: ocean acidification; auditory response; olfactory response; sensory behaviour; \n\nreef fish larvae \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n1 \n \n\n1. Introduction \n\nOver the last century, the concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other \n\ngreenhouse gases, resultant mainly from combustion of fossil fuels, agriculture and \n\ndeforestation, have been significantly increasing in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, leading to \n\nserious environmental impacts (Raven et al., 2005; IPCC, 2007). Levels of atmospheric \n\nCO2 have steadily raised since pre-industrial times (about 265 years ago), from about \n\n280 ppm (parts per million) to nearly 390 ppm in 2010 (Solomon et al., 2007; Tans &amp; \n\nKeeling, 2014) (figure 1).  It is expected that these levels will continue increasing at \n\nleast until the next century, and unless emissions are substantially reduced, it can \n\nreach levels above 1000 ppm in 2100 (Raven et al., 2005). \n\n    \n\nFigure 1 Keeling curve, variations in CO2 concentration (ppm) in Earth's atmosphere (Tans &amp; Keeling, \n\n2014). \n\n \n\nOceans have a fundamental role in the main processes that occur on Earth, and \n\nrepresent around 70% of its surface. They encompass a wide variety of habitats and \n\necosystems, contributing greatly to planet\u2019s biodiversity and providing livelihood for \n\nhumanity (Raven et al., 2005). The atmosphere and the oceans act as a linked systems, \n\nwhere changes that occur in one part of the system have consequences on the other \n\n(Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007). Thus, with the increasing of the atmospheric CO2 the \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n2 \n \n\npartial pressure of CO2 (?CO2) in seawater also increases. When in contact with the \n\noceans, CO2 is absorbed, leading to a chemical change of the carbonate of seawater \n\n(Gattuso &amp; Buddemeier, 2000; Zeeb-Gladrow &amp; Wolf, 2001). This causes ocean \n\nacidification (decrease in pH), which is occurring at a much faster rate than at any time \n\nin the past 650,000 years, representing a serious threat to marine ecosystems. In the \n\natmosphere, CO2 is a chemically unreactive gas but, when dissolved in seawater, \n\nbecomes more reactive getting involved on several chemical, physical and biological \n\nreactions (Raven et al., 2005). CO2 is dissolved in water and reacts with its molecules \n\n(H2O) forming carbonic acid (H2CO3):  \n\n(1) [CO2] + [H2O] ? [H2CO3];  \n\nCarbonic acid dissociates into H\n+\n (hydrogen ion) and HCO3\n\n- \n(bicarbonate ion):  \n\n(2) [H2CO3] ? [H\n+\n] + [HCO3\n\n-\n];  \n\nDue to the increase of H\n+\n, CO3\n\n2- \n(carbonate ion) reacts with H\n\n+\n forming HCO3\n\n-\n:  \n\n(3) [H\n+\n] + [CO3\n\n2-\n] ? [HCO3\n\n-\n] \n\nThus, the dissolution of CO2 in seawater leads to an increase in concentrations of H\n+\n \n\n(acidification), H2CO3 and HCO3\n-\n and to a decrease of CO3\n\n2-\n concentrations. This \n\ndecrease in CO3\n2-\n\n prevents the formation of carbonate minerals and promotes its \n\ndissolution, by influencing the equilibrium point of the following reaction:  \n\n(4) CaCO3 ?   [Ca\n2+\n\n] + [CO3\n2-\n\n]; (CaCO3: Calcium carbonate).   \n\nIn summary, the rising level of CO2 in seawater increases the concentration of H2CO3, \n\nHCO3\n-\n and H\n\n+\n and decreases the concentration of CO3\n\n2-\nand pH (Raven et al., 2005) \n\n(figure 2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n \n\nIt is estimated that nearly half of the additional CO2 produced by humans over the past \n\n250 years has been absorbed by the ocean. The actual seawater pH is on average 8.2, \n\n0.1 units lower than the pre-industrial values (Raven et al., 2005). Based on realistic \n\nscenarios for future emissions of CO2, it is expected that the oceanic pH may decrease \n\neven more 0.3 - 0.4 units by the year 2100 (Caldeira &amp; Wickett, 2003) (figure 3), which \n\nwould result in acidity values never reached in the last 400 000 years (Feely et al., \n\n2004). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 Diagram of CO2 cycle between the atmosphere and the ocean. Atmospheric carbon dioxide \n\nis absorbed by the ocean where it bonds with water generating carbonic acid. This acid then releases \n\na bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion (increasing ocean acidification). Also, this hydrogen ion \n\ncombines with free carbonate ion in the water, producing another bicarbonate ion. The free \n\ncarbonate ion would otherwise be available to marine animals make calcium carbonate shells and \n\nskeletons. (Diagram adapted from Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007). \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 Atmospheric CO2 concentration and global average surface seawater pH projected under \n\nthree scenarios: the \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d IS92a CO2 emissions scenario (IS92a), the most (B1) and the \n\nleast (A1F1) conservative SRES scenario (adapted from Meehl et al., 2007 in Fabry et al., 2008). \n\n \n\nIt is expected that higher CO2 levels will result on serious impacts for Earth\u2019s ecological \n\nsystems, causing an overall loss of biodiversity, disruptions to ecosystems processes \n\nand a reduction in the ecological goods and services provided to human societies \n\n(Thomas et al., 2004; Lovejoy &amp; Hannah, 2005). High CO2 levels can cause harmful \n\neffects in some calcifying marine organisms by decreasing the saturation of calcium \n\ncarbonate and changing the calcification processes used on the production of shells, \n\nplates and skeletons (on corals and molluscs, for example) (Gattuso et al., 1999; \n\nLeclercq et al., 2000; Raven et al., 2005; Kleypas et al., 2006). Photosynthetic and non-\n\nphotosynthetic micro-organisms, the base of ocean food web, are other affected by \n\nocean acidification (Riebesell et al., 2000; Huesemann et al, 2002; Feely et al., 2004; \n\nRaven et al., 2005). For juvenile and adult fish it is unlikely that the skeletal growth will \n\nbe affected, since these life stages have precise control over their internal ionic \n\nenvironment (Munday et al., 2008). Yet, some variations can happen, such as \n\nvariations on skeletal or otolith (fish ear bone) development during their embryonic or \n\nlarval stages (Munday et al., 2008). In some species, physiological processes can also \n\nbe affected due to a decrease in pH levels of cellular fluids (Feely et al., 2007). \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nResearch in the field of ocean pH effects are becoming increasingly frequent. However, \n\nthere is a major gap on such studies regarding marine fish and their behavior \n\n(Ishimatsu et al., 2008). In general, early life history stages are more vulnerable to \n\nchanges in the surrounding environment, therefore, effects of acidification are most \n\nlikely to be detected on this phase of the life cycle. It is critical to understand the \n\nconsequences of an acidic environment in larval and juvenile survival, behavior and \n\nrecruitment, which may have significant consequences in adult populations.  \n\n \n\nReef fish cycle \n\nThe life cycle of fishes commonly includes four phases: embryo, larva, juvenile and \n\nadult. Some individuals manage to survive longer, reaching a fifth stage, the \n\nsenescence phase (Fuiman, 2002).  \n\nThe majority of reef fish are characterized by having a pelagic, generally larval, stage \n\nresulting in a bipartite life cycle. These two phases (pelagic and benthic) vary in \n\nmorphology, size, habitat, food and behavior (Leis, 1991). The spawning can be either \n\nbroadcast or demersal, and is followed by the pelagic larval phase that recruit to \n\nnearshore waters. Here they metamorphose and, in the case of fish with demersal \n\nadult life, settle to spend the rest of their adult phase (Leis, 1991; Leis &amp; McCormick, \n\n2002; Leis, 2006). Larvae may be subject to dispersal over long distances, from days to \n\nweeks (depending on the species), growing and developing in open waters (Fuiman, \n\n2002). In practice, a larva becomes juvenile when metamorphosis occurs and the \n\nexternal appearance of the individual changes (development of fins, sense organs, \n\nskeleton, external pigmentation, etc.). However, for many species with this bipartite \n\nlife cycle, the settlement of larvae, where they become associated with a substrate \n\n(coral, rock, or bivalve reef or vegetation), is sometimes used as a synonym for \n\nmetamorphosis (Fuiman, 2002).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n6 \n \n\nReef fish Larval Behaviour \n\nDuring the development of reef fish larvae before metamorphosis, when some \n\nmorphological and physiological systems develop, two different stages can occur \n\n(drawing from invertebrate terminology; Cowen, 1991): a pre-competent stage, where \n\nlarva undergoes a fast development and growth; and a competent stage, in which \n\noccurs a body maintenance and a reduced growth (Leis &amp; McCormick, 2002). As reef \n\nfish larvae have to find a settlement site, the timing of metamorphosis is probably \n\nrelated not only to developmental stage, but also to better success in finding suitable \n\nsettlement habitat (Leis, 2006).  \n\nIn the past, it has been assumed that pre-settlement stages of reef fishes were poor \n\nswimmers, not controlling their trajectories and passively drifting with currents. \n\nAccording to this view, all larvae behaved in the same way, regardless of species, \n\nontogenetic stage or location (Leis, 2006). However, in the past 20 years, several \n\nstudies seem to indicate the opposite. Studies in larval distribution have demonstrated \n\nthat larvae of different species but originated from the same habitats show different \n\ndistributions patterns (Reviews in Leis, 1991; Boehlert, 1996; Cowen &amp; Sponaugle, \n\n1997). This could not happen if larvae were passive swimmers, otherwise species \n\nwould all have equal distributions. There are also some evidences showing some \n\ndegree of self-recruitment on populations. Larvae and juveniles are able to settle on \n\ntheir natal reefs, representing in some cases, locally spawned larvae, 60% of all recruits \n\n(Swearer et al., 1999; Jones et al., 1999, 2005; Taylor &amp; Hellberg, 2003; Almany et al., \n\n2007; Planes et al., 2009). In addition, some species of perciform larvae, approaching \n\nsettlement, show remarkable swimming abilities (Stobutzki &amp; Bellwood, 1994, 1997; \n\nLeis et al., 1996; Leis &amp; Carson-Ewart, 1997; Fisher et al., 2000; Fisher &amp; Bellwood, \n\n2002), which allow them to control its dispersion and settlement. Thus, reef fish larvae \n\ncan act as active particles (Stobutzki &amp; Bellwood, 1997; Dudley et al., 2000; Fisher et al., \n\n2000; Leis &amp; Carson-Ewart, 2003), having great skills of movement that can be even \n\nbetter than those of newly settled individuals (Stobutzki &amp; Bellwood, 1994; Leis &amp; \n\nCarson-Ewart, 1997; Stobutzki, 1998).  \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nFish larvae also seem to show oriented swimming (Leis &amp; Carson-Ewart, 1999, 2000, \n\n2003; Leis et al., 2006a, b, 2007) in response to reefs, from distances of at least 1 km \n\n(Leis et al., 1996; Stobutzki &amp; Bellwood, 1998). There are indications that this \n\norientation behavior differs between night and day, with larvae moving towards reefs \n\nat night to settle (Stobutzki &amp; Bellwood, 1998) and offshore during the day to avoid \n\nreef-based predators and to feed (Leis &amp; Carson-Ewart, 1998; Stobutzki &amp; Bellwood, \n\n1998; Kingsford et al., 2002). However, it remains unclear what cues are used for \n\ndispersion and orientation in the pelagic environment. In nature, there are many cues \n\nused for orientation and navigation, which may contain visual, auditory, olfactory, \n\nmagnetic, and kinetic information. A cue can be more or less valuable depending on \n\nthe environment where it is propagated, on the utility of the information that it carries \n\nand on the ability that the receiver has to detect and interpret it. Consequently, \n\nmultiple cues will work through different distances and with different degrees of \n\naccuracy, being used to solve spatial challenges, according to their hierarchies \n\n(Kingsford et al., 2002). For example, large migratory fish (salmon and tuna) use \n\nolfactory and magnetic cues and sun orientation for their orientated swimming in the \n\nopen water (Ogden &amp; Quinn, 1984). Juveniles and adult migratory fish of coral reefs \n\nuse the compass orientation (although these cues are not very clear) (Ogden &amp; Quinn, \n\n1984; Quinn &amp; Ogden, 1984).  \n\nRegarding fish larvae orientation abilities, little is known. However, some cues are \n\nsuggested as being very useful for larvae on the selection of their settlement sites over \n\nlong distances. During the orientation in the sea, vision can only be used over tens of \n\nmeters, due to the attenuation of light in water. Since cues have to be detected from \n\nfar, visual cues may be removed from this range, as well as the lateral line. However, \n\nfor vertical distribution and settlement behavior, vision might be very useful (Myrberg \n\n&amp; Fuiman, 2002; Kingsford et al., 2002).  \n\nOn the other hand, sound (Tolimieri et al., 2002; Simpson et al., 2004; Montgomery et \n\nal., 2006) and olfactory (Sweatman, 1988; Atema et al., 2002; Arvedlund &amp; Takemura, \n\n2006; Gerlach et al., 2007) cues emanating from reefs are likely to be the most \n\npotentially cues used by pelagic reef fish larvae to recognize and locate a suitable and \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n8 \n \n\n\u2018healthy\u2019 reef to settle. However, it is still unclear what can be detected, at what \n\ndevelopment stages it can be identified and over what spatial scales orientation can \n\noperate (Leis, 2006). These two kinds of cues can carry information on the direction \n\nand the type of habitat from which they come from (Kingsford et al., 2002; \n\nMontgomery et al., 2006) acting over kilometer-scales.  \n\nLarvae of many reef fishes have well-developed olfactory organs (Arvedlund et al., \n\n2007; Lara, 2008), supporting the hypothesis that they use olfactory signals to guide \n\nthem toward to a settlement site. This assumption has been demonstrated in some \n\nstudies. It was showed that fish larvae in a current, ignored downstream sites and had \n\npreference for upstream sites to settle (Elliott et al., 1995; Lecchini et al., 2005a). \n\nSettling larvae of some species could detect differences between the smell of their \n\nhome reef and other reefs, preferring their home reef for settlement (Gerlach et al., \n\n2007). Apogonids larvae were able to distinguish and preferred olfactory cues from \n\nlagoon waters comparing with ocean waters (Atema et al., 2002). Finally, Elliott et al. \n\n(1995) showed that during settlement, juvenile anemonefishes (Amphiprion \n\nmelanopus) use olfactory cues to detect and select the host anemones (also verified by \n\nArvedlund et al., 1999 and Dixson et al., 2008). Settling larvae also responded to \n\nolfactory cues from resident conspecific adults (Sweatman, 1988; D\u00f8ving et al., 2006). \n\nHowever, odours have a disadvantage as an orientation cue, as they are current-\n\ndependent and diluted with distance from the source, being their components possibly \n\ndegraded (Montgomery et al., 2001; Leis &amp; McCormick, 2002). The olfactory cues thus \n\nact over small distances and can only be detected when larvae is near to odour source. \n\nThese cues are normally involved in the avoidance of predators during the settlement \n\nprocess (Munday et al., 2009; Dixon et al., 2010). Although vision and \n\nmechanoreception are also used by larval reef fishes to identify and avoid predators \n\n(Chivers et al., 2001) olfaction is probably far more significant during the settlement \n\nstage, since normally larvae settle at night when visual predator cues detection is \n\nmuch lower (Dixon et al., 2010). Being this stage a period of an enormous predation \n\nrisk (Caley et al., 1996; Almany &amp; Webster, 2006), the capacity to recognize such cues \n\nis very important to ensure larval survival. \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nUnderwater sound has a huge potential to act as an orientation cue. Sound travels fast \n\n(4.4 times faster in water than in air) over long distances (hundreds to thousands of \n\nmeters) through water with low attenuation, being highly directional (Urick, 1983; \n\nRogers &amp; Cox, 1988; Richardson et al., 1995; Popper &amp; Carlson, 1998) and current-\n\nindependent (because it is not dispersed by currents) (Armsworth, 2000). It can carry \n\nbiological information about reefs (Myrberg, 1978; Hawkins &amp; Myrberg, 1983; \n\nStobutzki &amp; Bellwood, 1998; Montgomery et al., 2001; Kingsford et al., 2002), varying \n\nthe noise with the local fauna (Cato, 1980; McCauley &amp; Cato, 2000; Radford et al., \n\n2008a, b). Auditory cues from reefs are a complex signal originated either from abiotic \n\nand/or biotic sources. Abiotic sounds can consist of physical processes acting along the \n\nreef such as the movement of water, geologic events, waves breaking on the coast and \n\nraindrops on the water surface (Popper &amp; Hastings, 2009). Biotic sounds might be \n\nproduced by several organisms such as fishes and invertebrates (snapping shrimp and \n\nurchins). These sounds can be produced with different purposes, such as \n\ncommunication over short and long distances with mates, offspring or conspecifics, or \n\nto catch prey (Popper &amp; Hastings, 2009). Reef sounds may vary with time (season, \n\nmoon phase and time of day) and the biological chorus has cyclical patterns in \n\nintensity, having a maximum during summer evenings around the new moon period \n\n(Cato, 1978; Radford et al., 2008b). \n\nBroadly speaking, the frequency hearing range of fishes lies between 30 and 1000 Hz, \n\nhowever there is great variation in hearing sensitivity among species. There are species \n\nwith special adaptations that can detect sounds up to 3000 - 5000 Hz and other that \n\nare sensitive to infrasound or ultrasound (Slabbekoorn et al., 2010).  \n\nRegarding to fish larvae it is somehow difficult to determine their auditory skills. In the \n\npast, it was believed that their hearing capabilities were quite limited (Myrberg &amp; \n\nFuiman, 2002). Nowadays, still little is known about what sounds (frequencies and \n\nintensities) larvae can hear and use, and over what scales (for navigation, for example), \n\nas well as the ontogenic development of these capabilities. The work of Egner &amp; Mann \n\n(2005) and Simpson et al. (2005a) suggests that coral reef fish early embryonic stages \n\ncan hear and that the response to noise probably changes with fishes\u2019s ontogeny. \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nKenyon (1996) also shows that juveniles of two pomacentrid damselfish species, \n\nStegastes partitus and Stegastes variabilis exhibited relatively poor auditory thresholds \n\nin comparison to conspecific adults. Apparently, larval fishes can hear between 100 \n\nand 1000 Hz (Leis et al., 2011).  \n\nSeveral field studies have demonstrated evidences that reef sounds are potentially \n\nuseful cue for settlement stage larvae to locate a suitable settlement habitat (Tolimieri \n\net al., 2000). By using light traps and underwater loudspeakers in order to determine \n\nwhether fish larvae were attracted to sound emanating from reef, it was demonstrated \n\nfor the first time that sound is a potential navigational cue in the aquatic environment. \n\nIn this study the authors verified that temperate water triplefin larvae were more \n\nattracted to the light traps with underwater speakers broadcasting reef noise than to \n\nthe silent light traps.  For some settlement-stages coral reef larvae it was likewise \n\nverified (Leis et al., 2003; Simpson et al., 2004). Also, by using patch reefs from dead \n\ncoral rubble playing reef recordings, Simpson et al. (2005b) registered a higher natural \n\nsettlement rate when compared to silent control patches. Further, some larvae are \n\nable of directional hearing, localizing a sound source (Tolimieri et al., 2004; Leis &amp; \n\nLockett, 2005)  and can differentiate between artificial (pure tones) and natural sounds \n\n(reef noises) (Leis et al., 2002). This response of coral reef fish larvae to auditory cues \n\nhas been also physiologically demonstrated (Wright et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nConsequences for larvae in a future acidified ocean \n\nThe increasing of CO2 and pH reduction in seawater have been found to adversely \n\nmodify the behavior and sensory responses of early life history stages of reef fishes. \n\nPrevious studies have found changes in larvae natural responses to odours and sounds. \n\nFor example, Munday et al. (2009) reported that clownfish larvae (Amphiprion percula) \n\nreared in pH 7.8 became highly attracted to odours that avoided in ambient pH \n\nconditions (similar results observed by Dixson et al., 2010 and Munday et al., 2010) \n\nand larvae reared in pH 7.6 showed no response to those olfactory cues. The authors \n\nsuggest that such disruptions were due to a damage in the transfer of chemosensory \n\nsignals within the neurosensory system caused by the alteration of pH and ?CO2 (not \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n11 \n \n\naffecting this change the development of the external sensory apparatus of larvae). \n\nMunday et al. (2010) showed that larvae exposed to a high CO2 concentration had a 5-\n\n9 fold higher mortality rates due to predation, with many individuals becoming \n\nattracted to the predator\u2019s odour or losing the ability to sense it. The loss of aptitude \n\nto respond appropriately to odours when exposed to elevated CO2 conditions was also \n\nverified for pre-settlement damselfish (Pomacentrus amboinensis), as well as the \n\ninefficiency in their learning (Ferrari et al., 2012a). \n\nRegarding to the auditory response, other experiment showed that juvenile clownfish \n\n(Amphiprion percula) reared in ambient CO2 conditions avoided predator-rich daytime \n\nreef noises. In its turn juveniles reared in higher CO2 conditions were not able to \n\nrespond appropriately to these sounds. (Simpson et al., 2011).  \n\nAltogether, these results suggest that the ocean acidification, caused by the additional \n\nCO2 absorption by the ocean surface can have remarkable consequences on the \n\nrecruitment success of adult populations, disturbing the functioning of marine \n\necosystems. \n\nIt becomes to essential predict the effects of ocean acidification in different areas, \n\nincluding temperate zones, for instance the Portuguese coast. \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\nDespite the recent advances in the understanding of the impacts of ocean acidification \n\non coral reef fish larvae, little is known on the response of temperate fish larvae to the \n\nincreasing levels of CO2 expected in the coming decades. This study aims to provide \n\nessential data on the influence of those oceanic conditions on the behavior and \n\nsensory systems involved in the survival of larval populations of temperate reef fish, as \n\nwell as their resilience. Specifically, the objectives of this study are: \n\n(1) Assess if CO2-induced seawater acidification scenarios affect the ability of \n\ntemperate rocky reef fish larvae to respond to predator olfactory cues, likely to be \n\navoided when searching for reefs and settlement sites;  \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n12 \n \n\n(2) Assess if CO2-induced seawater acidification scenarios affect the ability of \n\ntemperate rocky reef fish larvae to respond to auditory cues, likely to be used when \n\nsearching for reefs and settlement sites;  \n\nFor this purpose, wild-caught larvae of sand-smelt (Atherina presbyter) and painted \n\ngoby (Pomatoschistus pictus) were exposed to two pH levels, ~ 8.10 (control CO2 \n\ntreatment) and ~ 7.6 (high CO2 treatment). \n\n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n2. Materials and methods \n\n2.1. Experimental species \n\nFor this research, larvae of two species of teleost fishes were used, Atherina presbyter \n\n(Cuvier, 1829) and Pomatoschistus pictus (Malm, 1865). \n\nA. presbyter (sand-smelt) is a small pelagic fish species that inhabits coastal areas and \n\nestuaries, near surface. Its distribution ranges from the British Isles and southern \n\nNorth Sea to the Canary Islands, Mauritania and Cape Verde Islands (Quignard &amp; Pras, \n\n1986), having also been reported in the Azores archipelago (Santos et al., 1997). It \n\nbelongs to the Atherinidae family that is represented in the central-eastern and north-\n\neastern Atlantic by a single genus, Atherina, and three species (A. hepsetus, A. boyeri \n\nand A. presbyter) (Fischer et al., 1981; Quignard &amp; Pras, 1986). A. presbyter is the \n\ncommonest species of this family in the north-eastern Atlantic (Creech, 1990).  \n\nThis species reproduces in spring and summer (Billard, 1997), spawning inshore in very \n\nshallow waters (Bamber et al., 1985). Their large eggs are often associated with \n\nseaweed (Bracken &amp; Kennedy, 1967; Bamber et al., 1985), and larvae hatch after 15-16 \n\ndays, with a total length of 6.7-7.5 mm (Bamber et al., 1985). Hatched larvae are well \n\ndeveloped and remain inshore in shoals, amongst shelter, and near the water surface \n\n(Bamber et al., 1985). Larvae are active predators on visually selected animals in the \n\nwater column (feeding strategy similar to adult), feeding mainly zooplankton (Bamber \n\net al., 1985). These shoals include a range of ages (sizes) and can be found in shallow \n\nwater near the shore on the coast or in rock pools (Holt, 1898, 1899; Ehrenbaum, 1905; \n\nMiller, 1962; Bracken &amp; Kennedy, 1967; Palmer, 1979; Bamber et al., 1985), which \n\nallows them to escape predation by adult shoals (Bamber et al., 1985). The postlarval \n\ndevelopment (figure 4) is divided into 5 stages (related with swimbladder, \n\nmelanophores, fins and scales development), until juvenile shows all the external \n\ncharacteristics of the adult fish (at their total length (TL) 23 - 24 mm) (Bamber et al., \n\n1985). When juvenile's fins are fully developed (when fish reaches ~18 mm TL), they \n\ntend to start moving away from the shallow waters edge to live their adult life \n\n(probably swimming becomes so efficient that replaces sheltering as an escape \n\nstrategy) (Bamber et al., 1985).  \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 Postlarval development of Atherina presbyter: a) newly hatched postlarva, total length    \n\n7.0 mm, b) 10.7 mm TL specimen, c) 13.4 mm TL specimen, d) 15.4 mm TL specimen, e) 19.0 mm TL \n\nspecimen (Palmer &amp; Culley, 1984). \n\n \n\nP. pictus (painted goby) is a small benthic-coastal fish species that preferably inhabits \n\non shallow gravelly or sandy environment (1-55 m in depth) (Miller, 1986). Its \n\ndistribution occurs along the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean \n\n(Miller, 1986). It is one of the eleven species of Pomatoschistus genus in the Gobiidae \n\nfamily (Miller, 1986). This family comprises the greatest number of known fish species \n\nand are quite successful (Nelson, 1994).  \n\nIts reproductive period depends on its geographic region, it may start in February or \n\nMarch and lasts until June or July (Miller, 1986). In Portugal, it goes at least from \n\nMarch to July (Pedro, 2006). During this period, male builds the nest under empty \n\nbivalve shells laying on sand (Miller, 1986). The protection of the nests that are used as \n\nspawning sites are ensured by males that also provide parental care of the eggs (Miller, \n\n1986). Larvae hatch with 2.7-3.0 mm of total length (Russel, 1976) after 11-12 days \n\n(Miller, 1986), developing in planktonic environment (Lebour, 1920).

Collection of larvae  \n\nLarvae of sand-smelt, Atherina presbyter, and painted goby, Pomatoschistus pictus, \n\nwere collected in the very nearshore of Alpertuche beach (38\u00b0 28\u2019 N; 8\u00b0 59\u2019 W), located \n\nat the Arr\u00e1bida Marine Park (Portugal), using a 1 mm mesh dip net, during the month \n\nof July 2013. Sand-smelt schools were mainly collected at the surface, while painted \n\ngoby larvae were collected close to the bottom. \n\nCollected larvae were placed in a 30L bucket in ambient seawater, with gentle aeration \n\nand immediately transported to the laboratory. Larvae from each species were then \n\ntransferred to separate 35 L aquariums, with fresh seawater, and left for one day to \n\nrecover from transport and handling stress. Following this period, larvae were \n\nrandomly assigned to a pH treatment, according to the experiment. Olfaction and \n\nhearing experiments were carried out at two pH levels, of ~ 8.10 (control CO2) and \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n~.7.6 (high CO2). These pH values were both representative of the present-day pH \n\nconditions and the expectations for the future. \n\nLarvae were fed twice a day with Artemia sp. nauplii and a summer light cycle (14:10 h \n\nlight : dark cycle) was simulated using fluorescent lights. \n\nThe time (in days) that larvae of each experiment were exposed to the pH treatments \n\nprior to sensory tests is summarized in table 1. Due to logistical reasons, the minimum \n\nperiod of time that larvae were exposed to pH treatment was 2 days (sand-smelt of \n\ncontrol CO2 treatment in hearing experiments). In comparison with the other periods \n\nmay be considered short. However, it seems to be an acceptable period of time, since \n\nit is in the pH control treatment, in which there is no influence of pH decrease. In \n\naddition, similar periods have been used with larvae and juvenile fish in other studies \n\n(Tolimieri et al., 2004; Lecchini et al., 2005b).  \n\n \n\nTable 1 Summary table with the range of time (in days) spent by larvae in each treatment prior to \n\nsensory tests (for both olfaction and hearing experiments). \n\nExperiment Treatment \nTime in treatment prior \n\nto sensory tests \nCue \n\nSand-smelt: Olfaction \nControl CO2 11 - 18 days  \n\nPredator vs. blank \nHigh CO2 11 - 18 days  \n\nPainted goby: Olfaction \nControl CO2 7 days  \n\nPredator vs. blank \nHigh CO2 7 - 21 days \n\nSand-smelt: Hearing \nControl CO2 2 - 17 days  \n\nDaytime reef sounds vs. \nsilence \n\nHigh CO2 15 - 16 days \n\nPainted goby: Hearing \nControl CO2 16 - 36 days \n\nDaytime reef sounds vs. \nsilence \n\nHigh CO2 6 - 14 days  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n17 \n \n\n2.3. Experimental set-up and seawater manipulations \n\nThe experimental set-up consisted of 2 x 200 L recirculating seawater systems that \n\nwere maintained at different conditions of pH and each supplied seawater to 6 \n\nreplicate 35-L aquariums. Each 200 L recirculating system was equipped with biological, \n\nmechanical, chemical and ultraviolet filtration. Temperature and salinity were kept \n\nconstant during experiments (values shown in Table 2). The artificial seawater was \n\nobtained in the laboratory by blending a commercial salt mixture (Tropic Marin\u00ae) with \n\nfiltered freshwater. To ensure the maintenance of the pH treatments where larvae \n\nwere reared, CO2 was dosed to a set pHNBS. The control treatment was established by \n\nthe diffusion of ambient air in the seawater. The acidification condition was simulated \n\nby pumping the seawater with CO2, through a system of an electronic pH-controllers \n\n(Tunze Aquarientechnik, Germany) that maintained pH at the desired level. The pH \n\ncontroller was attached to a sump. Rearing tanks were sealed on top with a clear glass \n\nlid to limit CO2 exchange with the atmosphere. Temperature, salinity and pH of each \n\naquarium were independently validated twice daily, using a portable meter (SevenGo \n\nDuoPro, SG23) calibrated weekly with fresh buffers (Mettler Toledo). pH was \n\nmeasured on the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) scale. Oxygen levels were \n\nmaintained above 90% saturation by the mixing action of the diffusion pumps in the \n\nsumps. \n\nSamples for total alkalinity (TA) determinations were collected once a week, from each \n\ntreatment, placed in air-tight containers without air space, stabilized by mercuric \n\nchloride poisoning (Dickson et al., 2007) and kept at +4\u00b0C until further analysis. \n\nAnalysis of TA were performed using the spectrophotometric method described by \n\nSarazin et al. (1999). Average seawater ?CO2 was calculated using these parameters in \n\nCO2SYS, with the constants of Mehrbach et al. (1973) refit by Dickson &amp; Millero (1987). \n\nEstimated seawater parameters are shown in Table 2. \n\nBiological activity in the recirculating system and occasional water exchanges caused \n\nfluctuations in pH and total alkalinity of seawater during the experiment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nTable 2 Summary of mean seawater parameters in control and acidified treatments. \n\n \n\nAlthough pH values were within an expected range, ?CO2 values were higher both in \n\ncontrol and high treatments than expected, indicating that a higher amount of CO2 was \n\nrequired to acidify water in this experiment. The use of a commercial salt mixture is \n\nmost likely responsible for these values. Nevertheless, these values were \n\nrepresentative of the present-day conditions in many coastal areas (corresponding to \n\n~400 \u00b5atm atmospheric ?CO2; Solomon et al., 2007; Keeling et al., 2009) and of what \n\nwas predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change for the year 2300 \n\n(~2000 \u00b5atm ?CO2; Caldeira &amp; Wickett, 2005; IPCC 2007). Total alkalinity of Tropic \n\nMarin\u00ae seawater was slightly higher in all treatments than values reported from the \n\nnatural seawater (~2300-2500 \u00b5mol kg\n\u20131\n\n seawater) (Zeebe &amp; Wolf-Gladrow, 2001; \n\nRiebesell et al., 2010), as is typical for artificial sea salt formulations. Thus, the \n\nestimates of the effects of ocean acidification obtained in the present study need to \n\ntake this in consideration, as the CO2-induced changes in pH and carbonate chemistry \n\nmight be stronger in the natural seawater with lower alkalinity. \n\n \n\n2.4. Odour experiment \n\n2.4.1. Olfactory cues \n\nTo test the response (preference or avoidance) of larvae reared on different pH \n\ntreatments to olfactory cues, a two channel choice flume was used (figure 6), adapted \n\nfrom Gerlach et al. (2007). Larvae were able to freely swim to either side of the \n\nchamber. Water from two different sources, treated with different olfactory cues, \n\nflowed through plastic tubes to the chamber (see figure 6). The flume allows a laminar \n\nflow separation of the two water sources. A constant gravity-driven flow of 100 mL \n\nmin\n-1\n\n per channel, which was measured with a flow meter, was maintained throughout \n\nall experiment. To ensure that the flow was separate and parallel in the two channels, \n\nTreatment pHNBS  \u00b1 SD  T(\u00baC) \u00b1 SD Salinity \u00b1 SD  TA \u00b5mol Kg\n-1 \n\nSW \u00b1 SD  ?CO2 \u00b5atm \u00b1 SD  \n\nControl CO2 8.10 \u00b1 0.05 15.91 \u00b1 0.65 33.85 \u00b1 0.71 2545 \u00b1 231.39 537.15 \u00b1 55.98 \n\nHigh  CO2 7.61 \u00b1 0.02 15.98 \u00b1 0.42 33.69 \u00b1 0.22 2876.67 \u00b1 148.99 2080.56 \u00b1 99.37 \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n19 \n \n\nwith no turbulence or eddies, dye tests were performed before the experiments. At \n\nthe beginning of each trial, a single larva was released into the center of the \n\ndownstream end of the chamber. After 2 min of acclimation to the two water choices, \n\nthe position of larva on each side of the chamber was recorded every 5 sec, over 2 min. \n\nThis procedure was followed by 1 min of rest, during which the water sources were \n\nswitched in order to outwit any side preference that was not related with the water \n\nsource. After this minute, the entire test was repeated, including the 2 min acclimation \n\nperiod. \n\n  \n\nFigure 6 Two channel choice flume (design adapted from Gerlach et al., 2007). \n\n \n\nIn each trial, a larva was given a choice in the flume chamber between a water source \n\ntreated with a specific olfactory cue and an identical water source without that cue. \n\nArtificial seawater was used in the olfactory tests because it was assumed to contain \n\nno biological cues that the larvae may have become accustomed to during rearing.  \n\n \n\nSpecific olfactory tests included: \n\n(1) Untreated seawater compared with untreated seawater (blank1 vs. blank2), this \n\nwas used as a blank control;  \n\n(2) Seawater treated with the olfactory cue produced by predators compared with \n\nuntreated seawater. \n\n \n\nTo test the response of larvae to olfactory cues from a predator, water from a tank of \n\nadult sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, was used to test Atherina presbyter larvae. Sea \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nbass was chosen as it is known to prey on small pelagic fishes, such as atherinids (Spitz \n\net al., 2013). For logistical reasons, the same odour source could not be used to test \n\nolfactory discrimination of Pomatoschistus pictus. For this species, water from a tank \n\nof adult blenny Lipophrys trigloides was used. As the natural range of concentrations of \n\nspecific olfactory cues in the environment is unknown, this protocol was designed \n\nsimply to test for a reaction to the odor at an arbitrary concentration.  \n\nThis protocol was performed for the two pH treatments, control CO2 (8.1) and high CO2 \n\n(7.6). \n\nAfter the test, fish were killed with the anaesthetic MS222 and fixed in 96% ethanol. \n\nLarvae were latter photographed under a dissecting microscope for further \n\nmeasurements. \n\n \n\n2.4.2. Statistical analyses \n\nDue to the high variance and non-normal distribution of most data, it was not possible \n\nto use parametric statistics. Instead non-parametric statistical tests were used. \n\nTo test an effect of time in treatment in the response of larvae to cues, the \n\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. When no differences were found, data were \n\ntreated together. \n\nTo determine if larvae exhibited a preference or avoidance for the tested cue, the \n\nmean proportion of time spent in the stream of water containing the predator cue (or, \n\nin blank1 vs. blank2, the designated) was compared against the null expectation of 0.5 \n\nfor no preference using the one-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test. \n\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was again used to verify if the response of larvae was \n\nsimilar in the presence and absence (control situation) of the predator cue, as well as \n\nto compare the larvae response to that cue when reared in different pH levels. \n\nFor all tests, the significance level was ?=0.05. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n21 \n \n\n2.5. Sound experiment \n\n? Details of daytime reef recording \n\nThe daytime reef recording was conducted at the Arr\u00e1bida Marine Park, at the very \n\nnearshore, and a depth of 8 meters (25/05/2013, 1245 hrs.), under calm conditions. \n\nThese diurnal sounds were taken with an omnidirectional hydrophone (HiTech HTI-96-\n\nMIN with inbuilt preamplifier, High Tech Inc., Gulfport MS) connected to a digital Sony \n\nPCM-M10 recorder (96 kHz 24-bit Recording). The recording had a total of 2 min. Later, \n\nthe recording acoustic data was analyzed using the software Avisoft SASLab Pro \n\n(Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) to obtain the spectral level (see figure 7). The \n\ntotal sound intensity [rms (rootmeansquare) expressed as dB re 1 \u00b5Pa] of this \n\nrecording was 122.6 dB re 1 \u00b5Pa. \n\n     \n\n \n\nFigure 7 Spectral level analysis of the recorded sound used on this experiment. \n\n \n\nThe sound from the daytime reef recording seems to have quite activity according to \n\nits range of frequencies and intensities. This activity can be caused by distant shipping \n\nindustrial or sismic-survey noise, wind and wave noise, and biological noise (the three \n\nprimary sources in most shallow waters regions) (Greene, 1995). The noise of wind and \n\nwaves produces frequencies between 10 and 1000 Hz, whereas biological noises can \n\ncover a very wide range of frequencies (Knudsen et al. 1948; Wenz 1962). \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n22 \n \n\n? The auditory choice chamber \n\nThe response to the reef sound was tested in an auditory choice chamber (figure 8), \n\nadapted from Simpson et al. (2011). The auditory choice chamber consisted of an \n\nacrylic tubular chamber inside a glass aquarium coated with polystyrene foam. Both \n\nends of the tubular chamber were covered with cotton fabric (acoustically transparent \n\nends). At one of the ends it was placed an underwater speaker, which was moved to \n\nthe opposite side of the aquarium in the middle of every series of tests, in order to \n\noutwit any side preference that was not related with the sound source. The \n\nunderwater speaker broadcasted the desired sound towards the chamber. At the \n\ncenter of this chamber there was an observation window where larvae were released \n\n\u2013 the larva release chamber.  \n\n \n\n \n\n- 25 cm deep glass aquarium \n\nFigure 8 Auditory choice chamber (adapted from Simpson et al., 2011). \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n23 \n \n\nIn order to reduce the low frequency ambient background noise in the auditory choice \n\nchamber and influence of the building\u2019s vibrations, the following adaptations were \n\nmade: \n\n- The choice aquarium was coated with polystyrene foam and laying in layers of \n\nrockwool and roofmate, on the top of a table; \n\n- Each leg of the table was placed inside a vase with sand and rockwool, in order to \n\navoid direct contact of the table with the floor.  \n\n \n\n? Adjust of the broadcast sound level in the auditory choice chamber \n\nThe recorded sounds were played back in the auditory choice chamber using a sound \n\nsystem that consisted of a Mp3 player, an amplifier module and an underwater \n\nspeaker (Electrovoice UW-30, Lubell Labs Inc., Columbus, OH, USA). \n\nInitially it was intended to use a similar intensity to that recorded in the rocky reef \n\nduring the recording of sounds (similar overall spectral composition) but due to \n\ntechnical difficulties this was not possible. Thus, the criteria used for choosing the \n\nsound level was to have a louder sound than the background noise and the existence \n\nof a gradient of sound inside the auditory chamber, to assure larvae could choose \n\nwhich way to go, avoiding or going in the direction of sound. The original recording of \n\nthe reef sounds was played back inside the chamber, and with the aid of the \n\nhydrophone, the emitted sound was recorded during 2 min at the near end (near the \n\nspeaker) and at the far end of the chamber (opposite side of the speaker). This \n\nprocedure was performed until the existence of a gradient of sound along the chamber \n\nwas verified, using the Avisoft SASLab Pro to analyze the sound. The spectral level \n\ncharacteristics of the broadcast sound at the beginning and at the end of the tubular \n\nchamber can be seen in figure 9, which also shows the gradient.  \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 Spectral level analysis of the broadcast sound at the beginning and at the end of the \n\ntubular chamber. It can be seen that the sound level is higher at the speaker side than at the \n\nopposite speaker side. \n\n \n\nIn order to analyze the ambient background sound existing in the experimental \n\nlaboratory, silence recordings (no replayed sound) were also made. It was then verified \n\nthat the ambient background noise would not affect much this study, since the \n\nbroadcast noise levels were higher than the ambient background noise.  \n\nIt was not possible to verify if the sound intensity was within the hearing thresholds of \n\nthe tested species, since we did not have the necessary equipment to investigate this. \n\nTo determine thresholds of hearing, one would have to proceed an \n\nelectrophysiological technique, the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), as described \n\nin Kenyon et al. (1998) and Simpson et al. (2011). The ABR measures in the eighth \n\ncranial nerve and brainstem auditory nuceli, the electrical potential produced in \n\nresponse to sound. This is considered to be the ideal method to use in the hearing \n\nabilities of settlement-stages fish larvae research, since it allows a quick measurement \n\nof the auditory capacity (Higgs et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n2.5.1. Auditory cues \n\nTo perform the acoustic experiment, the method used by Simpson et al. (2011) was \n\nadapted. At the beginning of each trial, one larva was placed in the release chamber, in \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n25 \n \n\nthe middle of the auditory choice chamber. After 1 min of acclimation, the reef sounds \n\nwere played (2 min recording in loop), and after 1 min, the larva was released in the \n\ntubular chamber, and its position recorded every 5 sec, over 2 min. The position of the \n\nlarva could either be \u201cspeaker side\u201d or \u201copposite speaker side\u201d - the tubular chamber \n\nwas divided with an imaginary line, and the area under larval release chamber was \n\nconsidered as opposite speaker side (see Figure 8.). Between each series of trials, the \n\nunderwater speaker was switched to the opposite end of the auditory choice chamber. \n\nIn addition, the tubular chamber was constantly flushed to avoid any olfactory gradient \n\nwhich could influence larva\u2019s choice and frequently renewed to maintain its \n\ntemperature constant. \n\nThe entire procedure described above was also performed in silence (no replayed \n\nsound), in order to test the potential for extraneous cues which could bias directional \n\nswimming behavior of larvae. \n\nThis protocol was performed for the two pH treatments, control CO2 (8.1) and high CO2 \n\n(7.6). \n\nAfter the test, fish were killed with the anaesthetic MS222 and fixed in 96% ethanol. \n\nLarvae were latter photographed under a dissecting microscope for further \n\nmeasurements. \n\n \n\n2.5.2. Statistical analysis \n\nBecause of the high variance and the non-normal distribution of data, it was not \n\npossible to use parametric statistics. Instead, non-parametric statistical tests were \n\nused. \n\nTo test an effect of time in treatment in the response of larvae to cues, the \n\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. When no differences were found, data were \n\ntreated together.  \n\nTo determine if larvae exhibited a preference or avoidance for a side of the auditory \n\nchoice chamber the mean proportion of time spent in the opposite side was compared \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n26 \n \n\nagainst the null expectation of 0.5 for no preference using the one-sample Wilcoxon \n\nsigned rank test. This test was performed for both silence and sound experiments. \n\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was again used to verify if the response of larvae was \n\nsimilar with the reef sounds and with silence (control situation), and to test the effect \n\nof CO2 treatment on the response of larvae between treatment groups. \n\nFor all tests, the significance level was ?=0.05. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n27 \n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1. Olfactory cues  \n\nRegarding A. presbyter larvae response to predator cues, no statistically significant \n\ndifferences were found after spending 12 and 18 days in each pH treatments \n\n(Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: p>0.10). Thus, data were grouped per treatment. \n\nIn the control test, where neither stream of seawater in the flume contained an \n\nolfactory cue, larvae of both pH treatments showed random movement, spending \n\napproximately equal amounts of time on each side of the chamber (figure 10). Larvae \n\nreared in control CO2 treatment (8.1) did not show any response in the presence of \n\nolfactory predator cue (One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=23, p>0.60). Larvae \n\nreared in high CO2 treatment (7.6) showed a slight preference for the predator cue, \n\nspending 63% of their time in that stream of water (One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank \n\ntest, n=23, p<0.05), but this apparent preference was not statistically significant. Lastly, \n\nlarvae did not exhibit any significant differences in their behavior response to predator, \n\nwhen comparing between the pH treatments where they were reared (Kolmogorov-\n\nSmirnov test: p>0.10). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10 A. presbyter larval response (mean \u00b1 s.e.m) to olfactory cue from a predator when reared at \n\ndifferent pH levels (control and high CO2).

Auditory cues \n\nRegarding control tests, during silent experiments, when neither side of the auditory \n\nchoice chamber had replayed sound, A. presbyter larvae reared in both pH \n\ntreatements showed no significant preferences for a side of the chamber (control CO2: \n\nOne-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=13, p>0.60; high CO2: One-sample Wilcoxon \n\nsigned rank test, n=15, p>0.30), with larvae spending between 41 to 54 % at the \n\nopposite speaker side of the chamber (figure 12). When presented with reef sounds, \n\nlarvae also showed no preference or avoidance for playback sounds, spending \n\napproximately equal amounts of time in the in the speaker side of the chamber, that \n\ncontained the auditory cue and in the opposite speaker side (control CO2: One-sample \n\nWilcoxon signed rank test, n=15, p>0.30; high CO2: One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank \n\ntest, n=15, p>0.20).

By \n\ncontrast, no avoidance behaviour was detected in larvae reared in CO2-enriched \n\nconditions (One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=27, p>0.80).  \n\nA significant effect of CO2 treatment was detected, with the response of the high CO2 \n\ntreatment being significantly different from the control treatment (Kolmogorov-\n\nSmirnov test, p<0.03). No deviation from random movement was observed in the trials \n\nwithout playback sound: mean percentage of time spent by each group towards the \n\nspeaker ranged from 46 to 55 % (One-sample Wilcoxon signed rank test, n=15, p>0.50 \n\nthroughout). \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13 P. pictus larval response (mean \u00b1 s.e.m) to acoustic playback of daytime reef noise when \n\nreared at different pH treatments (control and high CO2).

Discussion   \n\nRecent studies on tropical reef fishes have already showed that low pH values (i.e. high \n\n?CO2 levels) affect sensorial behavior in early life stages of these fishes, by modifying \n\ntheir responses to olfactory (Munday et al., 2009, 2010; Dixson et al., 2010; Ferrari et \n\nal., 2012a), auditory (Simpson et al., 2011) and even visual cues (Ferrari et al., 2012b; \n\nChung et al., 2014). The present study, suggest that such pH conditions might also \n\nsignificantly affect the sensorial responses (to olfactory and auditory cues) of larvae in \n\nsome temperate reef fishes. Such behavioral impairment in reef larvae may have \n\nremarkable consequences in population replenishment and sustainability (Munday et \n\nal., 2010). \n\n \n\n4.1. Olfactory cues  \n\nSand-smelt and painted goby larvae responded differently to the tested olfactory cues. \n\nOpposite to what was expected, sand-smelt larvae reared in control conditions did not \n\navoid the predator cue when sea bass odours were presented in the choice flume. This \n\nlack of anti-predator response was surprising since sea bass is known to be a predator \n\nof this species. There might be three possible hypotheses for these results. It is known \n\nthat learning has an important role in the development of anti-predator response of \n\nmany fish (Kieffer &amp; Colgan, 1992; Kelley &amp; Magurran, 2003; Ferrari et al., 2010) and it \n\nmay provide a mean by which na\u00efve prey will recognize a novel predator and react \n\nappropriately to this threat (Brown, 2003), increasing the chances of individuals to \n\nsurvive an encounter. This knowledge can be achieve by pairing alarm cues [olfactory \n\ncue released from the damaged epidermis of a prey that was attacked or captured by a \n\npredator, providing thus a reliable indicator of predation threat to conspecifics and \n\nsome heterospecifics (Chivers &amp; Smith, 1998)] with a predator cue (visual, odour or \n\nsound) (Smith, 1999; Suboski, 1990; Ferrari et al, 2010; Larson &amp; McCormick, 2005; \n\nHolmes &amp; McCormick, 2010). Perhaps sand-smelt larvae were still na\u00efve to any cue \n\nproduced by adult sea bass due to the absence of contact with it. The behavioural \n\nresponse to predation risk might have great energetic costs, which commonly involves \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nreducing the amount of time spent on other fitness-promoting activities such as \n\nforaging and growth (Sih, 1980;?Milinski, 1993; Sogard, 1997; Fievet et al., 2008). It is \n\nthus an advantage that larvae have the flexibility to discriminate between different \n\ndegrees of predation threat, in order to decrease the costs of reacting to a false alarm \n\n[threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis suggested by Helfman (1989), \u201cwhich \n\npredicts that prey individuals will trade-off predator avoidance against other activities \n\nby altering their avoidance responses in a manner that reflects the magnitude of the \n\npredatory threat\u201d]. \n\nAnother possibility is related to the fact that prey response, or absence of it, to \n\npotential predators odours may vary, among others, depending on a predator\u2019s body \n\nsize (Helfamn, 1989; Kusch et al., 2004). Perhaps sand-smelt larvae are too small and \n\ndo not enter in the size selection ranges of the adult sea bass, and therefore do not \n\nrepresent a major predator threat. As far as it is known, the larval stages do not belong \n\nto the feeding preferences of the adult sea bass (Spitz et al., 2013). \n\nThe other hypothesis for the apparent lack of anti-predator response by sand-smelt \n\nlarvae reared in control conditions might be related to the intensity of predator odours. \n\nWater from a sea bass tank was collected at a public aquarium (Aqu\u00e1rio Vasco da \n\nGama), where water circulates through a network of tanks replenished with other \n\nspecies.  The sea bass odours, might therefore, be diluted in other odors. In the future, \n\na more appropriate procedure to obtain a most reliable predator's odor would be as \n\nfollows (adapted from Holmes &amp; McCormick, 2010): place the predators into \n\nacclimation aquariums for 36 h, such that all fecal matter passes through the system \n\nand prevent contamination of the final cue. After this, place individual fish into \n\nseparate aquariums with fresh seawater and constant aeration for four days, without \n\nchanging the water or feeding the fish (to prevent fecal matter from contaminating the \n\nfinal odour). Then draw the water from the aquarium and freeze it in portions until \n\nneeded in the experiments.   \n\nWhen sand-smelt larvae reared in low pH conditions were tested, there was a slight \n\nchange in the chemosensory response to the predator, with larvae spending \n\napproximately 63% of the time in the predator cue. However, this preference was not \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n33 \n \n\nsignificantly different from larvae reared in control conditions. In order to clarify this \n\nresult it is suggested carry out the experiment with a greater N. \n\nRegarding painted goby larvae, there was not also an avoiding behavior of larvae \n\nreared in control pH in presence of L. trigloides odor cue. This apparent lack of \n\nresponse might be related to the fact that this blenny feeds on mussels, other benthic \n\ninvertebrates and algae (Zander, 1986), and it is not known to feed of fish larvae, not \n\nbeing therefore a known painted goby predator. To test the relation between these \n\nspecies, in laboratory conditions, P. pictus larvae were present to adult L. trigloides and \n\nthere were no predator-prey response. Therefore, this species was probably not the \n\nmost appropriate choice to test a predator response. When larvae reared in low pH \n\nconditions were tested, their behavioural response significantly changed, strongly \n\navoiding L. trigloides odour (81% of the time). Although L. trigloides is not a painted \n\ngoby predator, such behaviour may represent a sensorial impairment, responding \n\nlarvae to an odor they should not react. Such predator-prey response, in natural \n\nconditions, would require energy consumption which otherwise could be used in \n\ngrowth and development. This result suggests that seawater acidification can cause \n\ndamage in the larval olfactory mechanism, resulting in a confusion error in the \n\ndetection of important olfactory cues for larval survival of some reef species. Examples \n\nof these cues are those used in the recognition of a predator or in the selection of a \n\nsuitable habitat (cues that could help them locate and navigate towards reef habitat \n\nand select an appropriate settlement site). Thus, larvae will not adequately respond to \n\nodours that they may be subjected in their environment. Previous studies have also \n\nverified changes in chemosensory behavioural response of fish larvae reared in \n\nacidified pH. Munday et al. (2009) for example, verified that clownfish (Amphiprion \n\npercula) larvae  reared in lower pH conditions than the current-day, loosed their \n\nolfactory ability, showing preference for odours of inappropriate habitats and failing to \n\navoid predator cues. Dixson et al. (2010) also verified in their work a reduction in \n\nolfactory predator detection in clownfish larvae reared in acidified water. Larvae \n\nbecame strongly attracted to the smell of predators (also reported by Munday et al., \n\n2010 and Nilsson et al., 2012).  \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n34 \n \n\n 4.2. Auditory cues \n\nAs observed in the olfactory tests, the two target species responded differently to the \n\nbroadcast reef sounds.  \n\nContrary to what was expected sand-smelt larvae reared in both control and low pH \n\nconditions did not show any preference/avoidance to the reef sounds. In previous \n\nstudies using light traps, a higher density of larvae were caught in traps broadcasting \n\nreef noises (Tolimieri et al., 2000; Leis et al., 2003; Simpson et al., 2004). Moreover, \n\npatch reefs associated with reef recordings showed higher natural settlement rates, \n\ncomparing to silent control patches (Simpson et al. 2005b). There may be three \n\npossible explanations for the lack of responses in the larvae of this specie. First of all, \n\nsince sand-smelt is a specie with pelagic life, not having a bipartite life cycle, in other \n\nwords, remain in the pelagic environment as adults, possibly these larvae do not need \n\nto show any response to reef noise. Unlike reef fish larvae, these kind of larvae do not \n\nneed to locate a reef for settlement. Tolimieri et al. (2000) also did not verify any \n\nresponse of pelagic fish larvae to reef sounds emitted by an underwater loudspeaker \n\nassociated to a light trap. In addition, this specie has a particular life cycle. Adult sand-\n\nsmelt spawn inshore in very shallow waters, hatching a larva very well developed that \n\nremains inshore in shoals (Bamber et al., 1985). Only in the adult phase, they move \n\naway from the shallow water edge (Bamber et al., 1985). Again, these larvae do not \n\nrequire the reef sounds for guidance, and do not need to show, therefore, any \n\nresponse to reef noises. The third possibility is that the sounds used in the present \n\nstudy were out of the sand-smelt hearing sensitivity. Wright et al. (2010) tested, by \n\nusing the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR), an electrophysiological technique that \n\ncan define thresholds of hearing, the auditory abilities of larvae of four coral reef fish \n\nspecies (Lutjanus carponotatus, Pomacentrus amboinensis, Pomacentrus nagasakiensis \n\nand Plectropomus leopardus) and of similar-sized individuals of two pelagic species \n\n(Elagatis bipinnulata and Gnathanodon speciosus). Five of the six species studied, \n\ndetected frequencies between 100 - 2000 Hz, however, for E. bipinnulata the range of \n\nfrequencies heard was until 800 Hz. They also verified that larvae of coral reef species \n\nhad significantly more sensitive hearing at all frequencies tested than their pelagic \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n35 \n \n\ncounterpart species. Nevertheless, the authors hypothesize that such differences may \n\nhave a phylogenetic basis, instead of an adaptive basis, since the pelagic species tested \n\nwere of a different family than the coral reef species. Due to the lack of proper \n\napparatus to perform the ABR method, it was not possible to measure the hearing \n\nsensitivity of the larvae used in this study. It was therefore not possible to verify and \n\nconfirm that sand smelt larvae were not able to detect the daytime reef sounds. The \n\nhypothesis of a masking effect by the background noise to justify the lack of response \n\nby sand smelt larvae to the reef sounds should not be put aside. However, once again, \n\nit was not possible to know the hearing thresholds of these larvae. In future works it \n\nwould be interesting to analyze the response of sand-smelt larvae to different coastal \n\nhabitats sounds. According to Radford et al. (2010) these habitats have significant \n\ndistinct underwater sound signatures which might transmit information for a long \n\ndistance about direction and habitat quality being probably extremely importance for \n\npelagic larval stages of coastal marine organisms. \n\nPainted goby larvae reared in control conditions strongly avoided the daytime reef \n\nnoises (73% of the time spent at opposite speaker side). Although this might seem \n\nunexpected given that this is a reef dependent species, the result agree with previous \n\nfield research. Heenan et al. (2009), used for the first time light traps broadcasting \n\ndaytime reef noises and, contrary to what was expected, they verified that larval fish \n\nwere not attracted to these kind of sounds. Other studies also showed that during the \n\nday, larvae move away from reefs, to avoid reef-based predators and to feed (Leis &amp; \n\nCarson-Ewart, 1998; Stobutzki &amp; Bellwood, 1998; Kingsford et al., 2002). In turn, during \n\nthe night, larvae move towards reefs to settle (Stobutzki &amp; Bellwood, 1998; Tolimieri et \n\nal., 2000; Leis &amp; Carson-Ewart, 2003; Simpson et al., 2004; Simpson et al., 2005b; \n\nSimpson et al., 2008b).  In general, settlement-stage reef fishes are specially attracted \n\nby high-frequency sounds of reefs (mainly produced by invertebrates) (Simpson et al., \n\n2008b), contrary to adults and juveniles reef fishes that are more attracted by low-\n\nfrequency sounds produced by other fishes (Simpson et al., 2008a). When larvae \n\nreared in 7.6 pH treatment were tested, their behaviour was significantly different. \n\nThese larvae have reversed or lost their auditory preferences, showing absence of \n\nresponse to sounds (53% of the time spent at opposite speaker side). Similar results \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n36 \n \n\nwere shown in a previous study where it was found a change in the directional \n\nresponse of juvenile clownfish (Amphiprion percula) reared in acidified conditions to a \n\nreef day recording (Simpson et al., 2011).  This result suggests that the low \n\nacidification levels can compromise essential auditory behaviours for survival. It also \n\nsuggests that for painted goby larvae, the responses to auditory cues are unlike to \n\ncompensate the potential loss of other senses that acidification may cause, such as \n\nolfactory impairment.  \n\nIn order to anticipate the impacts of ocean acidification on fish behaviour, it is \n\nessential to understand the mechanism behind the changes of sensory and \n\nbehavioural responses. Otoliths (fish earbones) are sensory aragonite structures that \n\nhelp in balance, orientation and sound detection. Their size and morphology influence \n\nhearing capacity. These organs are able to detect sound due the movement of particles \n\nthat sounds create in the water (Popper et al., 2003; Popper et al., 2005). Increasing \n\nconcentrations of CO2 expected for future may affect the growth of these structures, \n\nbut little is known about how they will be affected. Results on the potential impacts of \n\nhigh levels of CO2 (low pH) in otoliths of coral reef fish, seem to indicate that larvae are \n\ntolerant to moderate increases in environmental CO2 (Munday et al., 2011a, b; \n\nSimpson et al., 2011). In contrast, experiments on larvae of white sea bass \n\n(Atractoscion nobilis) showed a higher otolith growth with elevated CO2 concentrations \n\n(Checkley et al., 2009). These opposite results could be due to different CO2 levels used \n\non the mentioned studies (Checkley et al., 2009: ~1000 ?atm and 2500 ?atm; Munday \n\net al., 2011a, b; Simpson et al., 2011: up to ~ 1050 ?atm). It can also be assumed that \n\nthere are intra- and inter-specific (even being sympatric and sharing the same ecology \n\nand life history) variations in CO2 tolerance on fishes, where some individuals might \n\nnot be affected by the changes in CO2 concentrations (also based by Munday et al., \n\n2010; Ferrari et al., 2011). Therefore, in future studies, it would be interesting  to \n\nanalyze otolith morphology and check if there are differences in size and/or shape \n\ndepending on the pH conditions where larvae are reared (perform a similar procedure \n\nto Checkley et al., 2009).  \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n37 \n \n\nMechanisms of behavioural impairment \n\nNilsson et al. (2012) hypothesized that the changes in the behavioural and sensory \n\nresponses happen probably because the high CO2 concentrations, and hence lower pH, \n\ninterfere with the neurotransmitter function in fish. Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A  \n\n(GABA-A) is the main neurotransmitter receptor in the vertebrate brain (Bormann et \n\nal., 1987). Nilsson et al. (2012) proposed that, in acidified conditions, ionic shifts (in Cl\n-\n \n\nand/or HCO3\n-\n gradient) would occur over neural membranes, which would cause a \n\nreversal of GABA-A receptor function in some neuronal circuits. This would affect \n\nbehavior and originate severe modifications in sensory preferences. The authors \n\nconfirmed this hypothesis by showing that the atypical behavioral effects resultants \n\nfrom the acidified conditions were reversed by using a treatment with a GABA-A \n\nreceptor antagonist (gabazine). Hamilton et al. (2014) also demonstrated that \n\nacidification impairs neurophysiology of fish, affecting GABA-A receptor function. The \n\nauthors verified that in juvenile rockfish (Sebastes diploproa), high CO2 levels (1125 \u00b1 \n\n100 \u00b5atm) increased their anxiety behaviour compared with control conditions (483 \u00b1 \n\n40 \u00b5atm). Then, by applying GABA-A receptor modulators they showed that, in \n\ncontrast to the antagonist gabazine,  the GABAA-receptor agonist muscimol caused a \n\nlarge increase in anxiety in fish. Those results are consistent with the changes in Cl\n-\n ion \n\nflux through these receptors in acidified conditions. Thus, for a result analysis even \n\nmore rigorous, one could also have treated the group of larvae that showed an \n\nabnormal auditory preferences with a GABA-A receptor modulator, in order to verify if \n\nthe changes that happened due to the high CO2 concentrations interfered with the \n\nneurotransmitter function in fish (perhaps with an antagonist of the GABA-A receptor \n\nlikewise Nilsson et al. (2012) did with olfactory preferences and behavioural \n\nlateralization of larval coral reef fish). This procedure should be considered in future \n\nexperiments.  \n\nThe capacity for most marine organisms to adapt to the ocean acidification has been \n\npoorly studied, yet it is unlikely that many marine species have genetic variation \n\nadapted to this fast change. Probably, only species with very rapid generation times \n\nwill be able to keep pace with change and adapt (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2007). Most \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n38 \n \n\nof the research already performed that focuses in pH and ?CO2 sensitivities of marine \n\norganisms is based almost entirely on short-term perturbation experiments. It will be \n\nimportant in the future to place long-term experiments (with several generations), \n\nsince it may occur acclimation (plasticity in phenotype within and between generations) \n\nand adaptation by selection of favorable genotypes. There are already some studies \n\nthat did so for some marine organisms (Burkhardt et al. 1999; Collins &amp; Bell 2004), \n\nshowing different adaptive responses. Since it is more difficult to perform long-term \n\nexperiments with fish, one could at least perform this study with the offspring of \n\nprogenitors of acidified environment, likewise Munday et al. (2009) and Dixson et al. \n\n(2010) did on their research.  \n\nThe TA values of seawater in this study were higher in both control and acidified \n\ntreatment (~2500 and ~3000 \u00b5mol Kg\n-1 \n\nSW, respectively), comparing with those \n\ndescribed from the natural sweater (2325 \u00b5mol Kg\n-1 \n\nSW; Barry et al., 2010) and with \n\nmany of previous studies in ocean acidification. However, these values are within the \n\nrange reported in nearshore waters of the southern Iberian Peninsula (de la Paz et al., \n\n2007, 2008). In addition, during a spring upwelling episode, Cabe\u00e7adas &amp; Oliveira \n\n(2005) observed even higher values (4600 ?mol kg-1) in a location near to the sampling \n\narea of the present study. These authors also reported in their study area extreme \n\nvalues of ?CO2 (470-1770 ?atm) that are probably due to the transport of higher \n\nquantities of inorganic carbon from deep, colder upwelled water. The nearshore \n\ncoastal regions often experience seasonal high ?CO2 values, therefore their future \n\n?CO2 levels will probably exceed the 1000-1200 ?atm (?pH 0.4-0.5) projected for 2100 \n\n(Meehl et al., 2007). It is of extreme importance to improve the knowledge about \n\nseawater carbonate chemistry in different oceanic systems, especially of coastal \n\nsystems in order to understand better the future consequences of ocean acidification. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n39 \n \n\n5. Final considerations   \n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study suggest that larvae of some species are sensitive \n\nto the potential future ocean acidification scenario, caused by the uptake of additional \n\nCO2 at the ocean surface. It may disrupt the behavioural response to both olfactory \n\nand auditory cues that may be essential for site selection at settlement in some \n\ntemperate reef fish larvae and for their survival. This will reduce the recruitment \n\nsuccess and will have consequences in long term for the sustainability of adult fish \n\npopulations, affecting significantly marine biodiversity. These results strengthen the \n\nneed to reduce the anthropogenic CO2 emissions in order to prevent the \n\nintensification of ocean acidification and to ensure the protection and conservation of \n\nmarine ecosystems and communities.  \n\nThis was a study of great importance in the topic of prediction of the consequences \n\nresultant from increased CO2 concentrations in the ocean. Upon our knowledge, it was \n\nthe first research that studied the effects of pH changes in the sensorial behaviour, \n\nboth auditory and olfactory of temperate reef fishes. More research is needed in this \n\narea, both performing this study on more species (because not all species of fish larvae \n\nrespond in the same way to alterations in pH) and improving the experimental \n\nmethodology, so try to understand better the repercussions of it. In addition, since \n\nglobal temperature rise will act simultaneous with ocean acidification (Raven et al., \n\n2005), it would be also of great importance to study the effect of the interaction \n\nbetween these two factors. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nAcidification effects in the behavioural responses of temperate reef fish larvae \n\n \n\n40 \n \n\n6.
