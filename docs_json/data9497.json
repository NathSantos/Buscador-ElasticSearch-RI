Introduction\n\nSampling is a sequence of operations \nperformed with the objective of removing \na representative part of its surroundings, \ncalled primary or global sampling. This \nprocess is necessary throughout the life \nof a mining venture. Its use in mining \nbegins with the preliminary steps of geo-\n\nlogical exploration, and continues for the \nresource reserves evaluation phase, mine \nplanning, mine and power plant opera-\ntion, laboratorial quality control, tailings \nlevel control, final product qualification, \ncontaminant monitoring of the burden \npile, springs, dams and finally, mine clo-\n\nsure monitoring. At all stages, representa-\ntive samples are fetched that serve as the \nbasis for specific studies in various areas. \nThe big challenge is to collect the so-called \n\"representative sample\".\n\nAgricola (1556) has already said \nthat \"a mining company that is ignorant \n\n\n\n272\n\nMethodology for selection of samples from borehole probe for technological characterisation of iron ore\n\nREM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(3), 271-277, jul. sep. | 2014\n\nand inexperienced in the art of mining, \ndigs a mineral occurrence without care-\nful discrimination, while one that has \nexperience and knowledge, first acquires \nsamples and proves the mineral\u2019s exis-\ntence, and when very narrow / wide and \nsolid veins are found, works only those \nthat will produce economic returns.\u201d \n\nA sampling theory proposed by \nPierre Gy (1955), tackles the issue of \nsampling representativeness. According to \nGy, there is no way of knowing whether \na particular sample is representative of \nits surrounding by only using sampling \nprocess surveillance or characterization \nof the sample itself. A sampling procedure \ndone with quality is able to recognize the \nsamples as being representative of the \nsituation.\n\nThe sub or super sizing of equipment \nprojected for usage in a power plant is a \nvery common mistake and inadequate \nsampling can be its cause. Studies done \nfor this purpose are usually conducted \nfrom samples of evenly-spaced boreholes, \nwhose mass is little representative of the \ntotal ore deposit (resource or reserve). \nMany projects are designed based on \ninsufficient information, and can generate \nhigh equipment adaptation costs because \nthe equipment proved to be inappropriate \nfor the type of deposit.\n\nThe risks in the evaluation of mining \nprojects are directly related to the prob-\nability of errors in the estimates. . As the \nestimates are taken from the sampling \nresults, this activity should be judicious \nand well-planned, to avoid surprises at the \nbeginning of the operation of the projects.\n\nThis type of surprise is common \nin the mineral sector. Burmeister (1989) \nexamined 35 Australian gold mine op-\nerations initiated in the period between \n1984 and 1987 and found that 23 of \nthem did not reach the expected produc-\ntion in the first year of operation. Those \nthat exceeded their production goals an-\nticipated improvements in the processing \nplants. Only two of the 35 reached the \nprojected content recovery; those that \ndidn\u2019t noted that the reasons for the differ-\nences between planning and production \nlevels included excessive dilution, inap-\npropriate estimative planning techniques, \ninappropriate geological interpretation, \nquestionable chemical analysis and insuf-\nficient probing. \n\nClow (1991) examined 25 advanced \ngold projects in Canada and found that \nonly three had achieved their expecta-\ntions. For the author, the main reason for \nthe failures was incorrect resource estima-\ntion due to factors mentioned below:\n\ni. poor data management;\n\nii. inappropriate treatment of high \nlevel values (outliers);\n\niii absence of large-volume samples;\niv. geostatistical application errors; \n\nand\nv. inadequate assessment of the dilu-\n\ntion and mining methods.\nAnother similar example was the \n\nstudy by Harquail (1991) about North \nAmerican gold mines. It detected 39 types \nof design flaws, 20 of which were due to \naspects related to reserve assessments, \nincluding basic sampling errors and lack \nof mining knowledge. He noted that most \nof the failures occurred mainly because \nthe expected production levels were not \nachieved and/or the inadequate process-\ning methods used for ore-poor mining \ngenerated high operational costs. Other \nauthors attributed the unexpected results \nof mining projects to inexperience in \nmine development, and the deficiency of \ngeology studies and financial engineering \nthat support production decisions (Vallee \net al., 1992).\n\nMost of the problems identified by \nthese authors are related to the estima-\ntion of Mineral resources and reserves, \nwhich is obtained from sample data. It \ncan be concluded that a poorly projected \nestimate of resources and reserves can \nlead to serious economic consequences.\n\n2. The sampling theory of Gy and sampling representativeness\n\nSampling is a complex selection \nprocess. According to Gy (1976), a \nselection process can be characterized \nin terms of a priori and a posteriori \nqualities.\n\nA priori qualities meet the follow-\ning conditions:\n\nThe selection process is said to be:\n- \u201cprobabilistic\u201d - when each ele-\n\nment of the batch has the probability of \nbeing selected.\n\n- \u201cnon-probabilistic\u201d - if the batch \nelements do not meet the \u201cprobabilistic\u201d \ncondition. For example, the selection \nmethod of selection that uses a hammer \nand shovel is based on a pre-defined \nselection of material and is a non-\nprobabilistic method. These methods \nare generally very biased and must be \nrejected since they do not permit a theo-\nretical approach.\n\n-\u201ccorrect\u201d - when all elements in the \n\nbatch are subjected to selection, and have \nan equal probability of being selected.\n\n- \u201cincorrect\u201d - when it does not \nmeet the condition of equal probability.\n\nA posteriori qualities are based \non the results of the selection and more \nspecifically on the statistical properties \nof the selection error e in relationship \nwith the difference between the critical \ncontent a\n\nE\n of sample E and the critical \n\ncontent a\nL\n of the batch sample lot L:\n\ne = (a\nE\n - a\n\nL\n) / a\n\nL\n\nThe selection process is said to be: \u201cunbiased\u201d - when the average m  check error is nil:\n\nm (e) = 0 ? m (a\nE\n) = a\n\nL\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u201cbiased\u201d or \u201cskewed\u201d - when the average error is not null. The average value is the bias B or systematic relative error:\n\nB = m (e ) ? 0 ? m (a\nE\n) ? a\n\nL\n(3)\n\n\u201creproducible\u201d - when the selection\u2019s er- ror variance is not greater than the given \"reproducibility standard deviation ?2\n0\n:\n\n?2(e) ? ?2\n0\n\n(4)\n\n\n\n273\n\nG\u00e9sner J. I. dos Santos et al.\n\nREM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(3), 271-277, jul. sep. | 2014\n\nm (e) = 0 e ?2(e)\n\nm (e) = 0 e ?2(e) ? ?2\n0\n\nm (e2) = m2(e) + ?2(e) ?

Precision and \n\naccuracy are achieved only at the limit. \nThe theory of sampling can also be con-\nsidered as the search for relationships \n\nbetween the conditions and the results \nof a sampling, i.e. between its qualities \na priori and a posteriori.\n\n3. Sampling in iron ore projects\n\nVarious types of sampling for differ-\nent purposes make up the database used \nby mining companies. The database used \nin the evaluation of geological reserves \nand resources in the study of mineral \nprocessing (grinding, sieving, flotation, \ngravimetrics, magnetic separation, etc.) \nis formed usually from probing samples \nand represents the main group of samples \nthat impacts on decision-making of the \ncompanies in the mineral sector.\n\nBig mining companies use the large \ndiameter probe to collect samples in bulk \nfor processing trials and metallurgical \ntests. Sometimes it is difficult to perform \nthis type of sampling because of the dif-\nficulty in allocating qualified companies \nand low equipment availability.\n\nAnother large-volume sampling \npractice adopted is the opening of small \n\npits or galleries for experimental workings \nand ore treatment on a pilot scale. In this \ncase, the environmental constraints have \nbeen a major problem for the collection \nof samples with representative volumes.\n\nDirect access to the mineral body is \ngiven by outcrops, galleries, research wells \nand boreholes. Each of these \"fronts\" of \nresearch carries factors affecting the rep-\nresentativeness of the samples, mainly due \nto the collection methods that permit sam-\npling in different volumetric brackets. In \nthe case of boreholes, the small mass of the \nsamples provides the information almost \nimmediately. Factors related to sample \nmass, probing recovery, nugget effect, rock \ndensity, contents and granulometry can \ngenerate possible errors, which in turn, \ndepend on sampling support. \n\nAt Vale, a large Brazilian mining \n\ncompany, the main means of collecting \nlarge volume samples are galleries, re-\nsearch wells and samples taken at the min-\ning front. Boreholed samples have already \nbeen used for several mineral processing \nstudies and the evaluation of resources and \nreserves. Other types of sampling results \nare also stored in the database at Vale: \nhandheld, for qualitative assessment of the \nlevels of rocks on the surface; boreholes \n(or reverse circulation diamond); channel \nsamples; etc.\n\nSamples are used in various types of \nstudies, among which the following stand \nout: density; granulometric and chemical \nvariability; mineralogical characteriza-\ntion; technological characterization; \npilot tests for definition of process routes; \nsimulation of operational parameters for \nthe plant; thickening tests; etc.\n\n4. Selection Methodology of borehole samples for mineral processing studies\n\nTechnological characterization \nstudies of ore types are very important \nin the development of new projects, ex-\npansion projects, and definition of plant \nand route process suitability. The results \nobtained are also used in equipment siz-\ning and other operational parameters, \nprediction of ore behavior in the mill, \nmass balance, tailings characterization, \nROM degradation studies, and product \npredictability, among others.\n\nUntil mid-2009, there was no de-\nfined methodology for the selection of \nsamples. Each sampling was performed \nempirically with criteria depending on the \nstudy\u2019s objectives. Its analyses observed \nonly if the average of the population levels \nwere close to the average of the selected \nsamples considered to be the historical \n\npopulation average (previous samples), \nin an attempt to find a parallelism be-\ntween the proportions of each lithotype \nin relationship with the resources or re-\nserves in order to determine the number \nof specimens to be collected. Also, there \nwas no check performed between the \nselected samples and the surroundings \nfrom which they were extracted. To try \nto minimize possible errors in the defini-\ntion of projects for power plants caused \nby inadequate or poorly representative \nsampling, a methodology is proposed, \nbased on the use of analytic statistical \nprocedures such as histograms and QQ-\nPlot (quantile-quantile plot) graphs for the \nvalidation of the sample selection.\n\nThe histogram represents a prob-\nability distribution function (fdp) dis-\n\ncretized from a particular variable. If this \nfunction is representative, the occurrence \nfrequency data can be measured as a func-\ntion of the class interval variable itself, for \ncertain volumetric support. These func-\ntions can be represented by accumulated \nfrequencies associated with cut-off values \n(fdpc, cumulative histograms). In the case \nof iron ore, for example, the frequency \ncurve of the data registering iron levels \nabove various cut-off levels is called the \nparameterizing curve and serves to quan-\ntify the resource or reserve for a given \nvolumetric support (sample, block, etc).\n\nAs a sample of this process, consider \nthe parameterization curve calculated \nwith all samples as being representative \nof the deposit (total curve). This curve is \nmade for each specific lithological group \n\n\n\n274\n\nMethodology for selection of samples from borehole probe for technological characterisation of iron ore\n\nREM: R. Esc. Minas, Ouro Preto, 67(3), 271-277, jul. sep. | 2014\n\ntaking into consideration the effects of \nthe spatial groupings of the samples and \ntechniques applied for ungrouping. The \nsubset of samples collected for the char-\nacterization process should have a param-\neterization curve that represents the full \ncurve and thus the curve for a particular \nlithological group in the deposit. For each \npercentile calculated by the total curve, \nthere is a cut-off value. Similarly, for the \ncurve representing the sampling process, \nthere should be cut-off values associated \nwith the aforementioned percentiles. With \nthis data, a chart comparing the cut-off \nvalues of the two curves, associated to \nthe same percentiles can be assembled \nand plotted in in a scatterplot (QQ-Plot). \nIf the two curves are similar, the cut-off \nvalues in the same percentile should be \n\nclose and the scatter plot points should \napproximate a straight line identity with \nthe bisect passing through the origin with \nan angular coefficient of 1.\n\n This technique is often used to \ncompare types of experimental theoretical \nprobability distribution (Gaussian distri-\nbution, for example).\n\nThe proposed methodology follows \nthe following scheme:\n\n1) a sampling request is made by the \narea responsible for processing, including \nstudies with quality specifications and \ntypes to be sampled;\n\n2) selection is made by a geological \nteam from the probing database, taking \ninto consideration the spatial distribution \nof samples throughout the mine pit, as \nwell as their representativeness in relation \n\nto the geological reserve resources; \n3) representativeness of the samples \n\nis validated in relation to required qual-\nity and is performed using statistical \nanalysis tools;\n\n4) a list of samples selected for \nthe location and subsequent collection \nis submitted;\n\n5) specimens are sent to mineral \nprocessing.\n\nThe following are two examples \nof application of the methodology. The \nfirst example was to check the sampling \nperformed for variability studies at the \nBrucutu Mine in 2007.
