The method consist of leaching those coatings and measure in Mass Spectrometer to define the sNd values (s notion that compare the ratio 143Nd/144Nd in terms of their deviation from the Chondritic Uniform Resevoir (CHUR) evolution line) correspondent to past bottom sea water. The radiogenic or unradiogenic parameter of waters with Southern and Northern source (SSW and NSW) was captured for the sediments coating and is used to identify their influence in the surrounded area of the studied core at 22 000 years until present. The core is localized in Mid Atlantic Ocean and was collected in the IODP program in site 306 core U1313. The results had presented convinced records, giving evidence that during Holocene deep waters did not experience distinguished changes; the influence of NSW indicating a reduce but not the shutdown of deep water formation in North Atlantic during LGM; and the record data suggest possible contributions of eastern water mass into Mid Atlantic during glacial time.\nKeywords: 143Nd/144Nd.

The behavior of the oceanic water masses in the past gives valuable information that can be used for hypotheses of future climate changes. Its study is also significant because the oceanic circulation controls the geochemical processes of the ocean basin, the sedimentary patterns and geomorphic features on the ocean floor.\nDifferent proxies have been used to study the distribution of water masses during the different climate changes that have occurred in the history of Earth. These changes from Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (approximately 24 ka to 19 ka) to the Holocene have been studied manly using proxies based on nutrients (6 C; Cd/Ca), oxygen isotopes of foraminifera (benthic and planktonic), A14C ventilation ages and ratios of radioactive trace metals (such as 231Pa/230Th and Nd) (GUTJAHR et al., 2008). The Nd proxy is a new method increasingly used to reconstruct the past oceanic circulation.\nThe water masses, their compositions, distributions and mixing have changed during climate changes, however, it is still not well understood if the climate changes influence changes of oceanic circulation or if these changes themselves influence the climate changes.\nThe most important place of deep water production is in North Atlantic Ocean that generates North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). It is a composite water mass with North Source Water (NSW) contributions derived from Iceland-Scotland (NEADW) and the Irminger basins (NWADW), Labrador Sea Water (LSW) and Subpolar Mode Water (SPMW). It is suspected that water masses dominated by Southern Source Water (SSW) as Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) replaced NADW during LGM, replacing NADW to intermediate depths accordingly called Glacial North Atlantic Intermediate Water (GNAIW). However, is not clear when happened the switch to modern circulation patterns (GUTJAHR et al., 2008).\n9 suboxic conditions (HALEY et al., 2004). Thus, the method of extract trace metals signal from marine sediments corresponds to the signal from deep water masses.\nThe Nd isotope (radiogenic and unradiogenic) composition of water masses depends on the provenance of continental input. The Nd residence time is 600-2000 years in deep waters, comparable to the water mass mixing time in ocean basin scale (few hundred years). Nd isotopes behave quasi-conservative in ocean water, this provides water masses with distinct isotope compositions. In global ocean scale the average time of oceanic circulation is 1500 years (FRANK 2002), the residence time of Nd in this case becomes a good tracer to reconstruct oceanic circulation.\n2\tOBJECTIVES\nThis study has the objective of reconstruct the interplay of South Source Water (SSW) and North Source Water (NSW) in the Mid Atlantic Ocean, related with glacial (LGM) and deglacial episodes into the range from 22 ka to 0 ka. This is examined by measuring sNd values from the core IODP U1313. This area is critical to compare to the three circulation modes theory: \u2018warm\u2019, \u2018cold\u2019 and \u2018off, (RAHMSTORF, 2002) and to generate data to contribute to the understanding of North Atlantic oceanic circulation switches.\n3\tLOCALIZATION\nThe studied core \u201cIODP U1313\u201d (Latitude: 41.0 N, Longitude: -32.95 E, water depth: 3426 m) (Fig. 1) sampled during the international Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Leg 306, was obtained from IODP Bremen\u2019s core repository. The sampling in Bremen was decided on the base of the age model from (STEIN et al., 2009) and with the aim of studying back to the last 22 000 years.\nThe core is localized in the northern Atlantic Basin (Fig. 2). The Atlantic Basin extends as S-shaped basin, between the Artic and subantarctic regions, with an area of 94 km2 (KENNETT, 1982). The basin receives a great amount of freshwater discharge from rivers, what generate a high rate of terrigenous sediment.\nThis basin is the most important place of deep water formation, where NADW is formed in the north, while AABW is formed in the south. This two water masses influence the sedimentation rate and the seawater-sediment interplay in the study core area.\nNorth Atlantic Ocean\nIODP U1313\nBay oil Biscay!\nI\nPortuqal L* 11 i \u2022 .\nLisbon^\u2019^Spain^\nCasablanca\n\u2019 '\nMorocco)\n500km\nFigure 1(left): Core photo from the first 150 cm revealed from core U1313.

These systems are closely connected to each other, which means whenever some change occurred in one of them, as consequence it had impact on the other sub-systems. Scientists from interdisciplinary research fields aim to reconstruct past environment, in particular focusing on the last glacial -interglacial cycle.\nSeveral proxies in paleoclimatology have been developed to track and interpret these changes, such as oxygen isotopes (6 O) as a function of global ice volume (and sea-level) fluctuations and temperature changes, carbon isotopes (A14C and 6 13C) to trace deep water masses and Uranium series isotopes (as Pa/ Th) to quantify ventilation rates.\nThe oceanic circulation, in large scale, is a combination of currents driven by winds (upper hundred meters of the sea), by fluxes of heat and freshwater cross the sea surface given an interior mixing (thermohaline circulation) and tides (gravitacional pull of the Moon and Sun) (RAHMSTORF, 2002).\n4.1\tThermohaline circulation\nThe term thermohaline circulation (as a main driver of the so called Meridional Overturning Circulation) describes the process of water transport due to two factors: temperature and salinity. The increase of salinity and decrease of temperature promote an increase in water masses density, making dense waters sink and less dense waters rise (RAHMSTORF, 2002; BROECKER, 2005; RAHMSTORF, 2006).\nA simplification of the thermohaline process is shown in figure 3 displaying the dominance of temperature; surface waters (warm and with higher rates of salinity) flows to higher latitudes (poles) where they lose heat and thus increase in density. These waters sink to the bottom of oceanic basins and form the deep or bottom water masses. As these water masses flows above the oceanic floor, the downward heat diffusion from overlaying masses and geothermal heat cause an increase of their temperature, hence a decrease of density. These waters rise eventually composing intermediate or surface waters (BROECKER, 2005).\nFigure 3: Schematic system of Thermohaline circulation. Surface waters are warmed in equatorial area, transported poleward where they lose heat. Their density is increased and they sink to bottom flowing to lower latitudes. The dense waters are warmed (by heat diffusion) decreasing their density, thus they rise in equatorial areas. Source: http://www.cleanet.org/details/images/28350.html\nThe Atlantic Ocean exhibits an important piece in the role of ocean circulation and\nclimate, mainly because it is a key place for deep water formation (Fig 4). The sinking of dense waters to the deep (deep water formation) takes place in the high latitudes due to the\nshallowing of the thermocline.\nLabrador Sea Nordic Seas Weddell Sea Ross Sea\nSurface flow\nDeep flow\nBottom flow\nDeep Water Formation\nWind-driven upwelling Mixing-driven upwelling Salinity > 36 %o Salinity &lt;34 %o\nO \u00a9\nFigure 4: Thermohaline circulation.

It consists mainly of the mixture of three water masses: Iceland Scotland Ridge Overflow Water, Denmark Strait Overflow Water and Labrador Seawater (FRANK 2002). NADW is a fresh water mass with low nutrients content, which flows southward, especially along the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC). NADW overlays Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW), owing to its higher density. NADW spreads into most of world's ocean, combines in sub-Antarctic area with circumpolar deep water and rise to Antarctic surface. This water can compose Antarctic Surface Water, Sub-Antarctic Surface Water or Intermediate Surface Water. The Antarctic\nSurface Water will flow northward to restart the circulation cell (Fig. 5). At the shores of Antarctica surface water lose heat and, mainly, sea ice formation increase it density, therefore it sink to the bottom forming AABW, which is a dense Bottom Water Mass that flows northward.\nAfrica\nBottom Water\nEurope |\n~ J\nGreenland I Iceland\nStrait of Gibraltar\nMediterranean Water\nCentral Water\nAntarctic Intermediate Wat er Antarctica STC AC AD\n60\"N 50 4 0 30 20 1 0 0 1 0 20 30 4 0 50 60 70 80\"S\nLatitude\nFigure 5: Movements of water masses into the Atlantic Basin.

AABW is formed in high southern latitudes and flows northward, where it combines with intermediate waters and flows southward. Source: http://www.geology.wmich.edu/kominz/C9THAtlantic.gif\n\n4.3\tPast Atlantic circulation\nIt is assumed that past circulation during the LGM considerably differed from todays due to the input of fresh water, changed transfer of heat from atmosphere, temperature of atmosphere (and ocean) and the placement of sea ice. It is supposed that the glacial Atlantic Ocean was better stratified (because of the steep salinity and temperature gradients between the water masses) and colder than today.\nIt is proposed that Glacial NADW did not sink to the very deep, but to the intermediate only. The deep and bottom circulation was dominated by Southern Source Water, that is AABW. It is also proposed that NADW formation was complete interrupted in certain time. Rahmstorf (2002) proposed three distinct modes that show the possible changes in the Atlantic oceanic circulation (Fig. 6). These were labeled as stadial (\u2018warm\u2019), interstadial (\u2018cold\u2019) and Heinrich mode (\u2018off). While the warm mode represents the modern situation, the cold mode shows that the GNAIW sinks to intermediate depth (about 2.5 km) only and goes to the south. The AABW flows northward until represented an opposing circulation cell. The off mode displays the situation when NADW formation was interrupted, making AABW the water mass responsible for the oceanic circulation.\nFigure 6: Schematic version of the three modes (\u2018warm\u2019, \u2018cold\u2019 and \u2018off) of ocean circulation as observed during different times of the last glacial period. Shown is the section along the Atlantic, the topographic rise represents the shallow sill between Greenland and Scotland. NADW is highlighted by the red arrow and AABW by the blue arrow. Red dot is the studied sample location. Source: Rahmstorf (2002) (modified).\nThe studied core is located at latitude 41.0 N, longitude 32.95 E and water depth: 3426 m (represented for the red dots in Fig. 6), and accordingly capable of recording changes potential variations of the influence of Northern or Southern Source Waters as well as their mixing. Since these two water masses have different sNd values, it is possible to identify which of them was mainly responsible for the bottom circulation cell for different time periods.\n5\tNEODIMIUM PROXY (sNd)\nPaleoceanography deals with the development of oceanic basins, such as its currents, shape, salinity and biological productivity. With the knowledge of the oceanic basins behavior is possible to reconstruct past climatic and environmental conditions. Information of paleoceanigraphic reconstruction is stored in sediments. Each proxy has a target, but more\n16 than one proxy can be used to measure the same target. For example to reconstruct the water mass distribution the following proxies can be used: oxygen isotopes of planktonic and benthic foraminifera, nutrients (613C, Cd/Ca), water mass A14C ventilations ages, ratios of water-borne radioactive trace metals such as 231Pa/230Th and sNd (GUTJAHR et al., 2007). In other words, proxy is a measurable descriptor used to establish a variable (WEFER et al., 1999) represent for sNd and oceanic circulation reconstruction respectively in this study.\nThe sNd Proxy has been increasingly used to constrain the sources and trace the pathways of water masses. The Nd isotopes (as others trace metals) are incorporated in authigenic Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides coating from marine sediments. Haley et al (2004) studied pore-seawaters and constrained that Fe-oxide and organic matter coatings are the dominant carriers of REEs. Under oxide or sub-oxide conditions, Nd provided from pore-water is trapped in coatings, consequently the bottom seawater Nd isotopes are recorded in sea sediments.\nNeodymium (Nd) is a rare earth element, atomic number of 60, average atomic weight of 144.24 (BOWEN, 1988) and has 7 stable isotopes. As all REEs, Nd exists in the 3+ oxidation state and it is found as carbonate (NdCO3+) or as sulphate (NdSO4+) complex. Its removal from water column is by particulate scavenging (adsorption) process, this explains the low concentration of Nd at the surface and the desorption/disaggregation process explains the increase of its concentration with depth. The deposition of Nd in marine and estuarine sediments is the most important sink (FRANK, 2002).\nThe isotope 143Nd is a decay product of the weakly radioactive isotope 147Sm. The Nd isotopes are represented in epsilon notation (sNd) that compares the isotopic ratio of radiogenic 143Nd and non-radiogenic 144Nd in terms of their deviation from the Chondritic Uniform Resevoir (CHUR) evolution line (equation 1).\nEquation 1: epsilon notation of Nd isotopes 143Nd and 144Nd. Source: Jacobsen and Wasserburg (1980 apud GUTJAHR et al, 2008).\n17 Earth's crust and input into oceanic basins. The release of Nd is caused mainly by weathering of continental and shelf sediments, and its riverine or eolian input and the subsequent leaching and mobilization from shelf sediments (FRANK, 2002).\n5.1\tNd sources and input processes\n143Nd is a stable isotope decay product of 147Sm (alpha emission), which decays with a half-life of 106 Gyr, thus the ratio Sm/Nd in rocks and mantle decreases with time. The abundance of 143Nd relative to others non-radiogenic isotopes of Nd (such as 144Nd) in a rock, vary as a function of age and Sm/Nd proportion. The ratio Sm/Nd in Earth's mantle (and mantle-derived rocks) is higher than in crust (and crust-derived rocks), this occurs because Sm stays preferentially in the mantle (FRANK, 2002). This is illustrated in figure 7 that shows the separation of bulk Earth into continental crust and residual mantle. It shows that continental crust has lower 143Nd/144Nd ratio, because it is enriched in non-radiogenic Nd isotope, while the residual mantle is enriched in radiogenic Nd isotope and present higher 143Nd/144Nd ratio. Comparing both (continental and residual mantle - shown as dashed line in Fig. 7) with the bulk Earth evolution (solid line in Fig. 7) the continental crust present negative while residual mantle positive sNd, this is explain for the same isotopic composition enrichment.\nFigure 7: Nd isotope evolution diagram. With the decrease of time the quantity of radiogenic Nd isotope (143Nd) increase in bulk Earth; the residual mantle is enriched in Sm and, consequently, in\nradiogenic Nd isotope, while continental crust is enriched in non-radiogenic Nd isotope. In comparison with the curve of bulk Earth the residual mantle has positive values for aNd, because the proportion of radiogenic Nd into it is higher than the bulk average, the opposite happens with continental crust that is enriched in non-radiogenic Nd. Source: Elderfield et al (1988, p. 108).\nUsing these isotopic compositions of Nd in seawater is possible to identify the sources of Nd. Since each oceanic basin is surrounded by different types and ages rocks, Nd composition in water masses depends on the input of the element in it, thus water masses will present specific sNd values and they are capable of being differentiated. NADW, AABW, and the deep Pacific Ocean have distinct modern neodymium isotopic (sNd) values of approx. -13.5, -8.0 and -4.0, respectively (ELMORE et al, 2011). The difference of sNd values into ocean show the drainage of different Nd sources, for example the North Atlantic is surrounded for continental Proterozoic or Archean rocks which provide sNd values around -40; in contrast, Pacific is surrounded by island arc rocks, which provide sNd values around +20 (FRANK, 2002).\nThe main sources of Nd in ocean water (Fig 8) are continental sediments (formed by the process of weathering) and volcanic dust by winds (eolian). As shown by Tachikawa et al. (1999) the eolian transport plays an important role in the Atlantic Ocean. As well as the input by rivers and the release of Nd by leaching and mobilization from the continental slope. The hydrothermal process does not show significant contribution to the Nd input, due to the\nprecipitation of Nd within or very close to the hydrothermal sources (FRANK, 2002).\nShelf: Nd\nScavenging\nHydrothermal: Hf, Ph\nContinental Crust\n.

The weathering releases continental sediments that contain Nd, they are transported by rivers and wind (vulcanic ashes also can be tranported by wind). Partial dissolution of shelf sediments also release Nd into seawater. The circulation processes (shown as grey and black\n19 arrows) causes mixing of the trace metals, which are deposited by scavenging process. Source: Frank (2002).\n5.2\tRemoval of REE (Nd) from sea water\nIn order to reconstruct past oceanic circulation, trace metals with shorter residence time than the average circulation time of the global ocean (1500 years) are used. This is important because if the trace metal has a very short residence time (for example Th 5-20 years), the water mass will not be able to produce a typical signature. The opposite happen with the ones with too long residence times (for example Sr 2-4 Myr), their isotopic composition in water mass will be constant through time. As well the half-time of a radioactive trace metal has also to be longer than the oceanic mixing times (FRANK, 2002; BAYON et al, 2002, GUTJAHR et al., 2008).\nThese requirements are fulfilled by Nd for this aim, which has a residence time of 6002000 years (Table 1). Because of its short residence time, it is not isotopically homogenized throughout the water masses, therefore is possible to distinguish water masses based on their isotopic signature (PIEPGRAS &amp; WASSERBURG, 1980). Therefore Nd isotopic composition can be used to track the water mass pathways through global circulation and time.\nTable 1: Radiogenic Isotope Nd system\nAverage Elemental Average Deep-\nRadiogenic Parent\tDeep-Water\tWater Residence\nElement kotopes Isotopes Half-Life Primordial Isotopes0 Concentrution\tTime, years\tInput Sources\nNd\t143Nd 147Sm\t106 Gyr 142Nd, l44\\d, I45 146Nd, ^pgg\u201d1 600-2000\terosion of continental\n146Nd, 14fiNd, ,5(,Nd\tcrust\nSource: Frank (2002)\n6\tMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThe sNd method of deriving past bottom water properties from sediment leachates is a new and promising method. The method was provided by the Marine Group led by Prof. A. Mangini and Dr. Jorg Lippold from Institute for Environmental Physics at the University of Heidelberg (Heidelberg, Germany) and supervised by Dr. Jorg Lippold. The sampling was assisted by scientists from Center for Marine Environmental Sciences (MARUM), University of Bremen (Bremen, Germany). The measurements were performed in co-operation with by\n20 Dr. Marucs Gutjahr from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton (Southampton, United Kingdom) and the GEOMAR Kiel (Kiel, Germany).\n6.1\tSampling\nThe sampling took place in Bremen (Germany) IODP core repository (in 25 th January 2013). The core was chosen to provide information about sNd values of bottom seawater from the North Atlantic Ocean during LGM until present. The applied age model used was developed by Stein et al. (2009).\nEach sample from the core IODP U1313 was collected with plastic collectors, and subsequently r bagged and labeled. Before starting the chemical procedure, the samples were freeze-dried, afterwards they were powdered and weighted (0,2 g - 0,3 g).\n6.2\tNd processing\nThe method was divided in nine lab steps (Fig. 9), adapted from the protocol described in Gutjahr et al. (2007) and Bayon et al. (2002). Although the chemical and methodical approach is well tested in general, it has to be adapted in order to meet the specific sedimentological requirements of a new core location.\nThe detailed protocol is included in appendix and the general descriptions are described below.\nLoosely absorbed metals were removed using 5 ml 1 M MgCl2 in a shaker for one hour, than centrifuged and rinsed two times with deionised water (Milli-Q system). After 8 ml of a 1M buffer solution (made of HAc and NaAc in a 1:1 ratio, pH 4,66) was used in order to dissolve carbonates on a shaker for three hours, in the middle of the dissolution (after 1h 30 min) the samples were centrifuged (10 min, 4000 rpm) and placed back on the shaker for the resting time. This diluted acid was used for attack the Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxide and not the lattice structures of clay minerals; the centrifuge in the middle of the process was done with the purpose of having a better carbonate dissolution.\nAfter centrifuged the liquid was collected, the Fe-Mn-oxyhydroxide coatings were leached with 8 ml Nd-leach (made of 0.05 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride (HH), 15% distilled acetic acid, 0.03 M Na-EDTA solution, buffered to pH 4 with analytical grade NaOH) for two hours in a shaker. The HH is the reducing agent responsible for the Fe-Mn oxides dissolution, while EDTA prevents the dissolved Nd to readsorb on the remaining\n21 sediments. The sample was centrifuged and 6 ml of leachate were collected with a pipette into beaker. The remaining sample (solid phase after the leaching) was stored.\nThe succeeding step is the sample\u2019s conversion from nitrate to chloride form, thus HNO3 and HCl are used to remove the organic chemicals. Thereunto the sample was dried, dissolved in 1 ml HNO3 (concentrate), 1 ml HCl (9 M) + 5 drops H2O2 and 3 ml HCl (1 M), drying it between each dissolution for approximately one hour (or until the sample get dry). 1 ml of the liquid was collected for OES measurement, but this measurement will not be discussed in this thesis.\nThe sample in chloride form is ready to the separation procedure of Nd from the others elements, this procedure was made in two steps (first and second columns). The first column consists of the REE\u2019s separation, for this the ion exchange resin \u201cDowex 50 WX 8\u201d was used. Before start the second column the sample was converted from chloride to nitrate form, drying and dissolved it in 1.2 ml HNO3 0.05 M.\nThe second column is responsible for the Nd separation, thereunto the ion exchange resin \u201cLN-Resin mesh 100 |im -150 |im\u201d was used. This final separation is important to separate Nd from others REE that can cause isobaric interference, as the case for Ce, which is more abundant (88.4% of the elemental abundance) in the natural sample than Nd and cause interference at isotopic mass 140Nd (DE LAETER et al., 2003).\nThe final step is the sample\u2019s conversion for the measurement, thereunto it was dissolved in 1.5 ml HNO3 (0.05 M).\nFigure 9: Schematic processing of the Nd separation per sample. Modified from Gutjahr et al. (2007).\n6.3\tValidations\nGutjahr et al. (2007) describe a 24 hours leaching for guarantee the residual Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide coating complete dissolution, as well as pressure digestion of the detrital sediment fraction. They showed different trace metals concentrations for two hours, 24 hours and detrital dissolution, as well as distinct mid REE enrichment from Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide, while no enrichment is found in detrital fraction. These observations lead to testify the reliability of the method, assuming that the Nd isotopic composition from Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide coating is not from the detritus, but probably from the seawater, and that the leaching procedure of Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide was not contaminated with detritus leaching.\nSr isotopes has been proposed to prove the validation of the method, since it is an element with long residence time in seawater and therefore it displays a homogenous isotopy in the ocean (PALMER &amp; ELDERFIELD, 1985; FRANK, 2002). Thus if the Sr isotopes signal of Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide shows the same value as the seawater signal (range of 0.70917 - 0.70918 87Sr/86Sr, (FRANK, 2002)) it is possible to validate the Sr provenance of seawater. However, Gutjahr et al (2007) showed that even if Sr isotopes from the Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide leachates do not present seawater values still Nd isotopy might be realiable. However, within the scope of this thesis Sr isotopes have not been measured.\n6.4\tMeasurements\n6.4.1\tMass Spectrometer (MC-ICPMS)\nThe mass spectrometer is a machine well used to measure isotopic composition of a wide range of elements, including the heavy radiogenic system as Nd and Sr. It separates atoms or rather ions with a different mass and measure their relative abundance. Its advantage is the versatility, rapidity analysis and mass bias behavior.\nThe MC-ICPMS determines the mass of a molecule (or element) by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of its ion. First the sample, containing different isotopes of an element, is ionized in inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The ions are accelerated by high voltage and filtered by electric and magnetic fields (perpendicular to the electric field) where the isotopically light and heavy ions are separated because of the Lorentz force (Fig. 10B) and collected (Fig. 10A) (MOOK, 2001). For the calibration different standards can be used, which are defined as isotopic references with a known quantity (ratio) of the target isotopes (TANAKA et al 2000).\nFigure 10: A. Schematic mass spectrometer. The gas passes through the ionization chamber where it is ionized. Its positive ions are accelerated by high voltage E in an electric field. In a magnetic field (perpendicular to the electric field) the ions with a heavier mass follow the larger circle, while the lighter the smaller circle. The ions are colleted and separated into the collectors.\nB. Vetorial representation of Lorentz force. A positive electrical particle charged (q+) and mass (m) moves in a flat surface with speed (v), in a magnetic field (B) perpendicular to this surface. The Lorentz force is perpendicular to B and v makes that the particle follows a circular path with radius r. Source: Mook et al. (2001, p. 180).\n6.4.2\tMeasurement procedure\nThe measurements were made using the Neptune multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometers (MC-ICPMS) at the National Oceanography Centre, University of Southampton (Southampton, United Kingdom) in November/December 2012; and at the GEOMAR Kiel (Kiel, Germany) in May/2013.\nFor standard bracketing one JNdi-1 measured for every five samples. The JNdi-1 is neodymium oxide reagent described by Tanaka et al. (2000) that follows two criteria, low abundance of elements that cause isobaric interference (as Ce and Sm) and high 143Nd/144Nd ratio. The corrections used were exponential mass bias on 146Nd/144Nd = 0.7219 and further corrections described in Vance &amp; Thrirlwall (2002).\nA Ce-spiked JNdi-1 standard was measured for the mass bias correction. The Ce\n142\nstandard was used because its isobaric interference on Nd, for this purpose the ratio 142Ce/140Ce was calculated, followed for a secondary mass bias correction (Slope-correction),\n142 resulting on a clear Nd signal (BLASER, 2013). The compilations of dates and corrections was developed using the software \u201cMicrosoft Excel\u201d.\n7\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nIn this chapter the measurement results are present as tables and charts. 46 samples have been fully processed from the core IODP U1313 (Table 2), seven of them were replicated in order to estimate the reproducibility of the measurements. The chart (Fig. 11) of replicate data present results with few deviations, suggesting a good reproducibility of the chemical treatment and measurement.\nReplicate\nFigure 11: Chart of aNd values and depth in core from the seven replicate samples; light blue area represent LGM period and light pink area represent Holocene.

The diamonds represent the measurement datas from Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide coatings fraction of the studied sediment core, which represent variability in the isotopic composition from the deep water mass.\nThe values can be separated in two trends: higher and lower sNd values. The area which contains higher sNd values is situated before 8 ka until 22 ka, this ages represent the Early Holocene and Upper Pleistocene, during this period the Earth expirienced the last glacial age and the following deglaciation. These values indicate more radiogenic Nd isotopes in the water mass with a relative large range between -13.2 (in 16.7 ka) and -11.3 sNd (in 10. 6 ka) (Fig. 12). In 17 ka the sNd values are the lowest within this time period and they show a continous increase until 14 ka going from -13 to -11.5,.when the values are similar to those found around 9 ka. A similar, however smaller, increase of values are also observed from 22 ka to 20 ka in the order of 0.5 s units (-12 to -11.5).\nThe other area contains lower sNd values and represents the more recent ages, from 8 ka until present, totally included by the Holocene. The values are lower owing to the presence of more nonradiogenic Nd isotopes in the water mass situated close to the site. They span a range beteween -14.6 (in 3.9 ka) and -13.3 (in 7.1 ka) (Fig. 12). However the values present a relative stability, is observed that from 6 ka to 4 ka there is the more pronounce decrease of values in order of 1 s unit. Followed for stable values and the last increase in order of 0.5 s unit, when the sNd values reach -13.7+0.1.\nThe transition from one area to another is marked by an gradual change in the values, with a beginning of sNd values bellow -13. Abrupt changes in sNd do also occur within each specific time period, but it is always (besids one time) eiher below or above -13. Further, two gaps can be observed between 11 ka - 13 ka and 17 ka - 20 ka, owing to the absence of samples selected during these periods. In face of comparison with values found in others studies the present NADW and glacial GNAIW sNd values are discriminated in Figure 11 based on studies by Gutjahr et al. (2008), Roberts et al. (2010), Gutjahr and Lippold (2011). It can be observed that the values from younger ages is in agrrement with the range of present NADW sNd values, in contrast of the older values, which did not reach the full glacial NADW\tsNd.\nFigure 12: eNd values versus ages of the Site U1313, the measured data are represented by the red diamonds; light grey shaded area represents present-day NADW eNd values; the light blue rectangle represents glacial GNAIW eNd values, both for Northwestern Atlantic extracted from Gutjahr et al. (2008) and Gutjahr and Lippold (2011). The Age model is based on the work by Stein et al. (2009).\nThe figure 13 shows the interpolated curve of aNd values of the same core. In this chart it is easier to observe the oscillations of the aNd through time. The first increase of values (between 22 ka and 20 ka described above) actually shows brief oscillations until reach the value of -11.5, this event is here associated with LGM. In this period the global ice sheets reached their maximum integrated volume (CLARK et al., 2009).\nAfter this period the values decrease at 17 ka, however, the transition is not well market due to the absence of samples, and could indicate a deep ventilating episode. The second increase (between 16.7 ka and 15 ka) is marked by a continuous rise of 3.3 a units in approx. 1 ka and could be associated with cooling events and the input of freshwater into the ocean, that could provide a diminishment of deep water formation resulting in more radiogenic aNd. The period between 15 ka and 13.5 ka shows two oscillations in the order of 1 a unit, at the first the values reach -11.8 while the second -11.6. However, such shifts are roughly the range of reproducibility as marked by the values at 14.7 ka. The maximum aNd value (-11.3) occur at 10.6 ka around the onset of the Holocene preceding the last and more pronounced decrease in the values, which reach values in agreement to present deep water mass values and mark the transition of the last glacial to the present interglacial period. This decrease appears not to be gradually but is interrupted by peaks of higher values, the first in\n8.6\tka (-11.8) and one other less pronounced at 5.8 ka (-13.5). Around 4 ka is situated the minimum value (-14.6 aNd), which, in a gradual curve, goes to values reaching -13.7 until recent ages.\nFigure 13: eNd curve, red diamonds represent the measured data; the light blue rectangle represent Last Glacial Maximum; the light gray rectangle represent present-day NADW eNd values for NW Atlantic. The LGM is based on Gutjahr et al. (2008), Gutjahr and Lippold (2011) and interpretation of the studied data record. Age model extracted from Stain et al. (2009).\n31 Some comparisons with results described in the studies by Gutjahr et al. (2008), Roberts et al. (2010) and Gutjahr and Lippold (2011), are here discussed with the aim to compare the correspondence and dissimilarity with the presenting results. This comparison will also be useful to base some considerations of the conclusions.\nThe data from Roberts et al (2010) and Gutjahr and Lippold (2011) are from the sediment core ODP 1063 situate in the around of Bermuda Rise (western North Atlantic), while the sediment core 12 JPC studied for Gutjahr et al. (2008) is situated along the Blake Ridge (western North Atlantic). The first one is 2 320 km while the second is 3 871 km SW away from the core IODP U1313 (Fig. 14), however both are located within the Western\nBoundary Undercurrent (WBUC), which transports NADW.\nVermont\nHampshire\nIODP U1313\nConnecticut\nODP 1063\n12 JPC\nFlorida\n0\n500km\nMassachusetts\nRhode Island\nHavana .\n- Cuba\nNew Jersey Delaware Maryland District of Columbia\nFigure 14 - Map with the cores 12 JPC, ODP 1063 and IODP U1313 locations.

The table of the compiled data and figures extracted directly from the authors studies are presented in annex (ANNEX B).\n32 Roberts et al. (2010) and Gutjahr et al. (2008) in 17.3 ka and later for the present study in 16.7 ka, which exhibit the lowest eNd values (-13.2).\nA continuous increase is observed until approx. 16 ka in all data records, except Gutjahr and Lippold (2011) whom shows an oscillating increase (this could be observed because of the detailed resolution of the sampling). During the period of 16 ka to 14 ka the data exhibit different behaviors.\nThe following discussions do not consider the Gutjahr and Lippold (2011) study, due their absence of data to more recently ages. In approximately 14.5 ka all of them present a peak with high values which is succeeded by decrease. Gutjahr et al. (2008) show a slow and continuous decrease, while in Roberts et al. (2010) and this study it is abrupt followed for two peaks of more radiogenic Nd isotopes, however the Roberts et al. (2010) data show oscillations more pronounced and greater period of duration. Around 12 ka Roberts et al. (2010) and Gutjahr et al. (2008) founded data in decreasing, marking the Yonger Dryas event (YD); however the presenting data has no record at this period. In both studies values bellow -13 eNd were found after 11.5 ka (end of YD event), other than the present study, on which the values only reach those values in 7 ka. In 9 ka all the tree record show a more unradiogenic Nd values, which in Roberts et al. (2010) and the present study more pronounced. From that date to present the eNd values vary in order of 2 eNd units, remaining within the range -13 and -15 eNd values.\nFigure 15 - Chart with aNd values from Gutjahr and Lippold (2011), Roberts et al. (2010), Gutjahr et al. (2008) in comparison with the present study (red curve), measured from sediments core localized into North Atlantic Ocean. See text above to comparisons.\n8\tCONCLUSIONS\nThe age model adopted in this study, developed by Stein et al. (2009), is not very robust and can present some shifts (+ 2 ka) in concern of it resolution, since it was made by Sea Surface Temperature (Alkenone based) correlated to other cores and is primary made for ages in a large scale (300 ka BP).\nThe recent data are in agreement with measurement of the NADW, which has aNd value of -13.5 (ROBERTS et al., 2010; FRANK, 2002). This is an evidence to prove that the method of Nd isotopes extraction from Fe-Mn oxyhydroxide is effective and reliable to represent data from water mass.\nThe stability of aNd values in Holocene suggest that the water mass that circulated this area was not much different from the present NADW, suggesting a northern source of water responsible for the NADW composition and that the deep water formation in North Atlantic was as strong as today. At 4 ka the aNd exhibit lowest aNd values, which can be related to a higher influence of more unradiogenic water masses (NADW), in very good agreement to early/mid Holocene AMOC overshoot, found in several records of paleocirculation e.g. (ROBERTS et al 2010) (see figure in ANNEX C).\nAccording to previous studies (HILLAIRE-MARCEL et al., 2001 apud ROBERTS et al., 2010) the increase of proportion from water mass coming from Labrador Sea into NADW composition occurred approx. 8 ka, this water mass present more unradiogenic aNd and would change the radiogenic signal in NADW, assuming that NADW was a mixture of masses fairly unradiogenic with northern (e.g. water masses coming from Iceland, Greenland and Norwegian with aNd in the range of -7.7 to -10.7) or/and southern source influence (AABW aNd in the range of -7 to -9) (LACAN et al., 2012; GUTJAHR et al., 2008). This could explain the accentuated decrease occurred at 8.6 ka saw in figure 13, which provides the more unradiogenic character to NADW during Holocene. The data record in early Holocene show more radiogenic aNd, which could be related with influence of water masses from southern source (SSW) (Fig 15) with aNd range of -9.4 to -10.1, since the core U1313 is located more eastern than the others core discussed above. It could even suggest that in the same period the oceanic circulation pattern in Mid Atlantic was different that observed in Western Atlantic, since is possible to see, at Early Holocene, the more radiogenic aNd of the samples from IODP U1313 in comparison of ODP 1063 and 12 JPC. The circulation into Mid Atlantic could be related to the \u201ccold\u201d mode from Rahmstorf (2002) (Fig. 6) while in Western\nAtlantic the circulation presented the same pattern as present circulation (\u201cwarm\u201d mode of\nRahmstorf (2002)).\nFigure 16 - Representation of the deep waters masses that promotes the deep circulation into Atlantic Ocean.

Source: Blaser (2013) (modified).\nThe period that preceding those decrease in eNd values is marked by more radiogenic values. This period is set in the last glacial age. The LGM was determined between 22 ka and 18 ka, when the eNd show radiogenic values, which was associated with the product of radiogenic water masses influence, as SSW and MW. It was observed that those values did not reach the present eNd values from AABW (-7 to -9 eNd), this may suggest that: the AMOC did not shutdown during this period (this was also observed by Gutjahr et al. (2008) and Roberts et al. (2010)), since the GNAIW was not totally influenced by SSW, but also by NSW. However there are still uncertainties in the identity of the water masses that composed the GNAIW and glacial NADW and AABW eNd composition.\nThe values found in this study show stronger contribution of unradiogenic composition than the data from western Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 15) during and after LGM (before Holocene). Suggesting that the contributions of water masses may not be influence only by NSW and SSW, but also by more unradiogenic masses coming from eastern North\n36 Atlantic (Mediterranean Water) (see table 3 to eNd values of water masses). How the data used to comparison (Fig 15) show more radiogenic pattern, they could be associated with more influence of SSW as well as NSW coming from Iceland, Scotland and Greenland. Suggesting that in past the northern water masses which compose todays NADW had different pathways, although more studies in eastern part of Atlantic (as well as western) should receive attention, leading to understand the shifts in eNd values and water masses circulation.\nClimate events such as Heinrich, Yonger Dryas or Dansgaard-Oeschger events (review in Rahmstorf (2002)) could be associated with oscillations observed after LGM. Although more information with different proxies and cores should be consider to propose such correlations.\nTable 3: Water masses salinity, eNd values and concentrations with corelated cruise/station and coordinates.

The good results were presented in agreement with water measurement records, therefore they contributed to the trustworthiness character of the sNd proxy. The well-established records might be also correlated with the low influence of volcanogenic materials, which promoted in others areas doubtful record (as is seen in cores close to Iceland). Thus, more detailed investigations should be done in this core with the aim to promote reliable information about past oceanic compositions. The use of a different method has a proposition to compare the data record with the coating sediment leachate, for example using fish teeth or foraminifera.\nThe age model used and developed by Stein et al (2009) is consistence, but it is not very stout, since it was made in large scale (ages > 300 ka) and could present shift in values until + 2 ka, which could promote troubling mistakes. To deal with this issue it is necessary to make measurements with 14C.\nBesides all the recent emerging data of past ocean and climate changes, many uncertainties still prevail, such as water masses behavior, isotopic composition and oceanic circulations models. This study made some interpretations that could afford with some uncertainties: the reduction but not shutdown of AMOC, stable pattern in Holocene deep waters and more unradiogenic sNd values in Mid North Atlantic Ocean (NAO) than western NAO. Some questions, on the other hand, still surround those contributions, the similarity in isotopic composition of water masses from past and present, mixing processes of water masses, relation between past and present ocean and atmosphere.\nReferences\nBAYON, G., GERMAN, C., BOELLA, R., MILTON, J., TAYLOR, R., &amp; NESBITT, R.

Black circles represent Nd isotope compositions of the detrital fraction. The modem N AD W\tas measured by Piepgras and Wasserbuig (1987), is shown in grey box. Typical\ninterglacial LNADW signatures were only recorded after the YD. Individual Nd isotope data are presented in Tables 1 and 5. Blue arrows in B indicate absolute age tie points published in Keigwin (2004) and Robinson et al. (2005).

(e) Bermuda Rise bottom water 143Nd/,44Nd isotope record covering the past 30kyr, expressed in the cN(j notation, representing the 14lNd/l44Nd deviation of a sample relative to chondrite uniform reservoir in parts per 10,000. The new' e^d data are presented together with and overlap those of Roberts et al. [2010], which extend from the latest LGM to the present-day and that were obtained by leaching of uncleaned foraminifera instead of bulk sediments. A large number of duplicates were produced in the course of our study and all data points are shown. The average Nd isotope composition for each sampled sedimentary depth including a gray 0.5 \u00bfNd error envelope is also shown for better visibi lity of the patterns. The horizontal yellow boxes in the Figure le indicate modem NADW tNd as well as deep northwest Atlantic SSWsNd during the LGM (sNd 10.3 \u00b10.5) [Gutjahr et al., 2008; Robertsetal., 2010], (c) Bulk sediment Ti/Ca [Lippoldet al.. 2009] and (b) NE Atlantic 1RD records from the Porcupine Seabight [Pecket al.. 2006] are shown forcomparison.
