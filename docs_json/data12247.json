To correctly describe these transport processes, an adequate pore \n\nspace characterization is required. In this context, the use of computerized microtomography \n\nallows the visualization of the soil structures and processes that occur at large scales may be \n\nvery useful, besides being a fast and non-destructive technique. Soil hydraulic properties, which \n\nare essential in the quantification of water balance components in hydrological models of the \n\nunsaturated zone, can be measured directly with field or laboratory methods. Simultaneous \n\ndetermination of these properties can be done by the Wind-Schindler evaporation method, but \n\ndetermining only the retention function is a more common practice. The relation between soil \n\nwater retention and hydraulic conductivity can then be predicted using theories like those \n\ndeveloped by Childs and Collis-George, Burdine and Mualem. These models treat pore-space \n\ntortuosity and connectivity as an empirical parameter, and its value remains usually \n\nundetermined, the use of a standard value being more common. Based on this contextualization, \n\nthe objectives of this thesis are: (i) to evaluate the correlation between soil hydraulic properties \n\nmeasured in the laboratory, and parameters that quantify soil pore space from 3D images \n\nobtained by X-ray microtomography; and (ii) to functionally analyze soil hydraulic property \n\nparameterization in the prediction of soil water balance components by an agrohydrological \n\nmodel. To verify the relationship between soil hydraulic properties and soil image parameters, \n\na stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed between the pore space parameters from \n\nimages and empirical parameters of the semi-deterministic model, obtained with evaporation \n\nexperiments together with an inverse solution method. Functional evaluation of soil hydraulic \n\nparameters was performed by a sensitivity analysis of the outputs of an agro-hydrological model \n\nto several ways of obtaining the tortuosity/connectivity parameter: applying the commonly used \n\nstandard value, or determining its value in evaporation experiments in the laboratory with wet-\n\nrange tensiometers, dry-range tensiometers, or both wet- and dry-range tensiometers. \n\nSimulations with the agro-hydrological model were performed for some years with distinct \n\nrainfall characteristics. The soil retention curve obtained using soil images had a good \n\n\n\n10 \n\nagreement to the retention curve obtained by the evaporation experiment, although the spatial \n\nresolution of the microtomograph allowed to only quantify macropores, consequently, to \n\ndetermine the hydraulic properties in a small range close to saturation. Soil hydraulic \n\nparameterization using a wide range of pressure heads is recommended for a better \n\nrepresentation of vadose zone processes and soil-water-plant relations. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Soil hydraulic properties.

Para descrever corretamente esses processos de \n\ntransporte, \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria uma caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o adequada do espa\u00e7o poroso. Neste contexto, o uso \n\nda microtomografia computadorizada permite a visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o das estruturas do solo e os \n\nprocessos que ocorrem em grandes escalas podem ser muito \u00fateis, al\u00e9m de ser uma t\u00e9cnica \n\nr\u00e1pida e n\u00e3o destrutiva. As propriedades hidr\u00e1ulicas do solo, que s\u00e3o essenciais na quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndos componentes do balan\u00e7o h\u00eddrico em modelos hidrol\u00f3gicos da zona n\u00e3o saturada, podem ser \n\nmedidas diretamente com m\u00e9todos de campo ou laborat\u00f3rio. A determina\u00e7\u00e3o simult\u00e2nea dessas \n\npropriedades pode ser feita pelo m\u00e9todo de evapora\u00e7\u00e3o Wind-Schindler, mas a determina\u00e7\u00e3o \n\napenas da fun\u00e7\u00e3o de reten\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 uma pr\u00e1tica mais comum.

Esses modelos tratam a tortuosidade e \n\nconectividade do espa\u00e7o poroso como um par\u00e2metro emp\u00edrico, e seu valor permanece \n\ngeralmente indeterminado, sendo o uso de um valor padr\u00e3o mais comum. Com base nessa \n\ncontextualiza\u00e7\u00e3o, os objetivos desta tese s\u00e3o: (i) avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da correla\u00e7\u00e3o entre propriedades \n\nhidr\u00e1ulicas do solo, medidas em laborat\u00f3rio e par\u00e2metros que quantificam o espa\u00e7o de poros \n\ndo solo a partir de imagens 3D obtidas por microtomografia de raios X; (ii) a an\u00e1lise funcional \n\nda parametriza\u00e7\u00e3o das propriedades hidr\u00e1ulicas do solo na predi\u00e7\u00e3o dos componentes do \n\nbalan\u00e7o h\u00eddrico do solo por um modelo agro-hidrol\u00f3gico.

\n\n \n\nPrediction of soil water state and movement of water in the soil is one of the most \n\nsubjects studied in soil physics. The importance of this theme is attached to processes related \n\nto availability of water to plants, transport of solutes in the soil, irrigation and drainage \n\nmanagement, soil and water conservation, among others. Besides these, there is the direct \n\ninfluence of the state and soil water balance on its thermal and gaseous regime. Knowledge of \n\nsoil water properties (retention and water conductivity) is essential for any modeling in \n\nhydrology, meteorology and plant production, since these properties are key elements in the \n\nfundamental equations involved and, therefore, in the quantification of forecasts soil water \n\nflow. \n\nSoil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity express, respectively, the \n\nrelationship between storage and energetic state of water, and the easiness with which water is \n\nconducted through the soil. Several factors interfere in soil retention capacity, one of those \n\nfactor is the grain size distribution, since it defines the area of contact between solid particles \n\nand water and determines the pore size distribution. Another important factor in water retention \n\nis the soil structure, as it characterizes the arrangement of the particles and, consequently, the \n\npore space geometry.  \n\nIn order to characterize the soil water retention, the water content and its specific or \n\npotential energy are correlated; this functional relationship is usually called retention curve and \n\ncan be correlated with the soil pore diameter distribution. The relationship between the soil \n\nhydraulic conductivity and its water content or potential, in turn, is determined by the geometry \n\nand continuity of its pores filled with water, thus becoming dependent on its shape, quantity, \n\ndistribution and continuity. Indirect methods to obtain saturated hydraulic conductivity may \n\npresume mathematical relationships and correlations between the saturated hydraulic \n\nconductivity, Ks, and other non-hydraulic soil variables, such as soil density, total porosity, \n\nmacro and microporosity, which influence the distribution of the pores and, consequently, the \n\npermeability of soils. \n\nAmong the methods to determine the soil hydraulic conductivity in function of water \n\ncontent or matric potential, there are field methods (instant profile, impermeable layers), \n\nlaboratory (internal drainage, hot air, evaporation) and empirical methods, based on pores \n\ndiameters distribution.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n20 \n\nEvaporation method, also called Wind method in homage to its proposer (WIND, 1968), \n\nis a laboratory method that is based on the water evaporation of a sample, allowing to \n\nsimultaneously determine the retention curve, h (?), and hydraulic conductivity as a function of \n\nwater content or matric potential, K (?, h). The determination is carried out under controlled \n\nmeasurement conditions and presents good performance, even in soils with low hydraulic \n\nconductivity. It consists of subjecting an initially saturated soil cylinder to a progressive drying \n\nduring which it is analyzed: (i) the temporal variation of soil mass m(t) in the cylinder to \n\ndetermine the rate of water loss by evaporation and (ii) The evolution of the matrix potential \n\nvalues h (z, t) of the water in the soil, in some vertical positions in the sample as a function of \n\ntime. For mass determination, the experimental set is placed on a self-registering scale. The \n\npotential of water is usually monitored with microtensiometers. \n\nWind methods advantages are: (i) in any measurement time, only mean water content \n\nof the sample needs to be determinate; (ii) the curves h(?) and K(?, h) can be estimated \n\nsimultaneously; and (iii) as discrete values of water content and hydraulic conductivity are \n\ncalculated, it is not necessary to infer about an adjustment mathematical model of water \n\nrelations \n\nIn addition to experimental techniques involving water movement itself, unsaturated \n\nsoil hydraulic conductivity can also be predicted from the geometry of the porous system \n\n(CHILDS; COLLIS-GEORGE, 1950; BURDINE, 1953; MUALEM, 1976) with the use of \n\nwater retention curve (BROOKS; COREY, 1964; MUALEM, 1976; van GENUCHTEN, \n\n1980). \n\nAlternatively, to the direct conductivity determination methods described above, the \n\npore space may also be characterized by tomography. This characterization may allow an \n\nestimation of the hydraulic conductivity. The microtomography (X-ray) or ?-ray \n\nmicrotomography is a non-destructive technique that can be efficiently used in studies related \n\nto soil structure. It allows cross sections visualization of samples interior without having to cut \n\nthem or make any other type of invasion. The ?TC technique uses the principle of radiation \n\nattenuation in media material, being the basic idea the image reconstruction of a section of the \n\nsample, through its projections in several directions. These projections are obtained by \n\nsweeping the sample with a radiation beam and measuring its attenuation. A matrix of data is \n\nthus formed which is processed in a personal computer, obtaining the image in the beam plane \n\nsection. \n\n  \n\n\n\n21 \n\nX-ray tomography has been used in the field of soil science since the early 1980s, and \n\npresents several advantages for pore space characterization: it allows a relatively quick \n\nmeasurement acquisition; it is non-destructive; and the resolution can reach micron scale or \n\nless. An increasing number of publications refers to this technique, along with new algorithms \n\nto enhance analyses and perform original measurements, such as pore size distribution, shape, \n\nconnectivity or orientation.

A better description and comprehension of transport processes in soils \n\nrequires a better characterization at the pore scale. It is common practice to determine hydraulic \n\nproperties (conductivity and retentivity) in lab experiments that are labor intensive and time \n\nconsuming. X-ray computerized microtomography is a fast and non-destructive technique that \n\nallows visualization of soil structures, offering a potential tool for understanding soil structure \n\nand its relation to transport properties. Coupling soil hydraulic property measurements and X-\n\nray CT, we evaluated the correlation between soil hydraulic properties measured in undisturbed \n\nsamples using evaporation experiments and 3D X-ray microtomography image properties; a \n\nstepwise multiple regression analysis was performed that allows to predict hydraulic parameters \n\nfrom image parameters.   \n\nKeywords: connectivity, pores, ImageJ \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\nSoil structure is considered a main attribute determining soil quality and its qualitative \n\nrole in soil hydrology is well documented on the pedologic scale. Soil macro- and \n\nmicromorphology is intrinsically related to soil structure given by pore space and spatial \n\ndistribution, being considered as the basis for explaining the influence of soil structure on \n\nhydraulic functions (KUT\u00cdLEK, 2004) as well as on mechanical characteristics (VOGEL; \n\nWELLER; SCHL\u00dcTER, 2010). \n\nNatural soils are porous media containing complex structures at several length scales. \n\nThe micro-scale, also referred to as the pore-scale, is the scale at which individual grains and \n\nfluid interfaces can be resolved and identified and at which many physical and chemical \n\nphenomena are rooted. Larger-scale processes are often governed by these small-scale \n\nphenomena (WILDENSCHILD; SHEPPARD, 2013). The flow of water through soil is \n\ncontrolled by the size, shape and connection of pores, which is in turn controlled by the size \n\nand packing of soil particles. \n\n  \n\n\n\n24 \n\nFor soil water dynamic properties, pore system continuity is often more important than \n\npore diameters (BERALDO; SCANNAVINO JUNIOR; CRUVINEL, 2014). Bouma (1982) \n\nhighlighted the importance of pore continuity for the flow of water and solutes in the soil, \n\nemphasizing that small pores often enhance soil hydraulic conductivity since they form a \n\ncontinuous network, while large pores cannot contribute to flow in the case of discontinuity.  \n\nTraditionally, porosity is characterized using soil bulk density and water retention data \n\n(EVERTS; KANWAR, 1992). Whereas these measurements are an indirect measure of pore \n\nsize distributions or porosity, they do not include any information on the spatial distribution of \n\nthe pores, on the nature of the pore space or on pore connectivity and continuity (GANTZER; \n\nANDERSON, 2002). More insight in soil pore space can be obtained by measuring hydraulic \n\nconductivity, both saturated and unsaturated. The relation between hydraulic conductivity and \n\nwater content or pressure head allows to infer about pore connectivity and continuity, by the \n\nintroduction of an empirical parameter to account for eccentricity of the flow path (CHILDS; \n\nCOLLIS-GEORGE, 1950; BURDINE, 1953; MUALEM, 1976).  \n\nAmong the water-based methods for determination of soil hydraulic properties, the \n\nWind (1968) evaporation method is a frequently employed one (\u0160IM?NEK; WENDROTH; \n\nVAN GENUCHTEN, 1998; SCHINDLER; M\u00dcLLER, 2006; PETERS; DURNER, 2008; \n\nPINHEIRO; VAN LIER; METSELAAR, 2017). It is a laboratory method based on the \n\nevaporation of water from a soil sample, allowing the simultaneous determination of the \n\nretention curve h(?) and the hydraulic conductivity property K(?,h) during the natural \n\ndesiccation of the soil. The calculation procedure evolved from a manually assisted iterative \n\nroutine (WIND, 1968) to modern inverse modeling techniques (\u0160IM?NEK; WENDROTH; \n\nVAN GENUCHTEN, 1998; SCHNEIDER et al., 2006).  \n\nBesides the indirect water-based measurement of pore geometry characteristics, the \n\ncharacterization of soil pore space can also be achieved by the direct observation of pores and \n\nfeatures using microscopic thin-section 1D techniques or by X-ray or gamma ray \n\nmicrotomography yielding 2D or 3D images. These techniques allow to visualize the pores \n\nwithin the technically possible resolution of each method and equipment used. Through 3D \n\nimages, it is possible to observe the geometry and spatial arrangement, enabling to visualize \n\nand quantify pore connectivity and continuity.  \n\nThe computer-assisted quantification of pore size distribution from soil images may be \n\nuseful to improve understanding of macroporosity and how it relates to tension and hydraulic \n\nconductivity. The pore size distribution derived from microtomography may allow to better \n\ndescribe near-saturated hydraulic properties (BECKERS et al., 2014), as an accurate description \n\n\n\n25 \n\nof the retention curve in the wet range is a challenge due to difficulties in determining precisely \n\nsoil water content at lower pressure heads near saturation (VEREECKEN et al., 2010). These \n\nauthors also pointed out the drawbacks of exact measurements in the change of water content \n\nat low pressure heads.  \n\nTraditional methods for the determination of hydraulic properties are often limited to \n\nrelatively narrow ranges of water content. On the other hand, microtomography technique \n\nallows a relatively quick measurement acquisition; it is a non-destructive technique, providing \n\na detailed view into the physical structure of undisturbed soil at a spatial resolution of a few \n\nmicrons. It is very promising due to its versatility, being applied in several areas, specifically \n\nin soil science for the representation and morphological quantification of porous space. The \n\njoint use of hydraulic properties and visual quantification of pore space may be helpful for a \n\nbetter parameterization and understanding of soil properties and behavior. Therefore, in order \n\nto verify the relation between soil hydraulic properties and soil image parameters that describe \n\nthe pore space, we analyzed soil images using microtomography as well as traditional water-\n\nbased determination techniques. \n\n2.2 Material and methods  \n\n2.2.1 Soil material \n\nUndisturbed and disturbed samples were collected from the subsurface layer  \n\n(0.10 \u2013 0.30 m depth) of four soils from S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil: a Rhodic Ferralsol (coordinates \n\n23\u00ba 06\u2019 17\u201d S; 46\u00ba 56\u2019 01\u201d W), a Rhodic Lixisol (23\u00ba 06\u2019 32\u201d S; 46\u00ba 55\u2019 54\u201d W), a Xanthic \n\nFerrasol (22\u00ba 42\u2019 51\u201d S; 47\u00ba 37\u2019 02\u201d W), and a Rhodic Nitossol (22\u00b0 42\u2019 02\u201d S; \n\n47\u00b0 37\u2019 22\u201d W). Undisturbed samples were collected in PVC cylinders (12 samples, 7.5 cm \n\ndiameter, 7.5 cm high) for CT analysis as well as in metal rings (64 samples, 5 cm diameter,  \n\n3 cm high) for water-based analyses. The samples were stored under refrigeration at field-moist \n\ncondition (i.e. not air dry to avoid structural changes due to shrinkage) and without mechanical \n\ndisturbance. Soil-particle density was determined by pycnometry using disturbed samples. \n\nResults are summarized in Table 2.1. \n\n\n\n26 \n\nTable 2.1 \u2013 Soil physical characteristics (average values \u00b1 standard deviation from 8 samples) \n\n Soil \n\n \nRhodic \n\nFerralsol \n\nRhodic  \n\nLixisol \n\nXanthic \n\nFerralsol \n\nRhodic \n\nNitosol \n\n     \n\nBulk density Db (kg m\n-3) 1506 \u00b1 85 1336 \u00b1 88 1851 \u00b1 54 1547 \u00b1 60 \n\nParticle density Dp, (kg m\n-3) 2577 \u00b1 67 2548 \u00b1 34 2590 \u00b1 57 2822 \u00b1 142 \n\nTotal Porosity, (m3 m-3) 0.416 \u00b1 0.076  0.476 \u00b1 0.061 0.286 \u00b1 0.055 0.452 \u00b1 0.101 \nSaturated hydraulic \n\nconductivity Ks, (m d\n-1) 2.85 \u00b1 1.74 3.15 \u00b1 2.88 0.030 \u00b1 0.049 0.624 \u00b1 0.36 \n\nGrain size distribution     \n\nSand content (kg kg-1) 0.603 0.678 0.754 0.346 \n\nSilt content (kg kg-1) 0.071 0.076 0.024 0.253 \n\nClay content (kg kg-1) 0.326 0.246 0.222 0.401 \n\nFAO texture class \nSandy clay \n\nloam \n\nSandy clay \n\nloam \n\nSandy clay \n\nloam \nClay \n\n \n\n2.2.2 X-ray CT scanning \n\nSamples taken in the PVC rings were submitted to image acquisition with a CT system \n\nNikon XT H 225, with the following technical specifications: dual reflection-transmission \n\ntarget system including a 225 kV, 225 W high performance X-ray source, equipped with a \n\nreflection target with pot size of 3 \u00b5m combined with a nano-focus transmission module, spot \n\nsize of 1 \u00b5m.  \n\nThe images were acquired in two steps, using copper filters to minimize artifacts; filter \n\nthickness was dependent on the soil type. The first step comprised the imaging of the entire \n\nsample at low spatial resolution (pixel size 40 \u00b5m, energy settings 150 kV and 280 \u2013 419 ?A). \n\nThe second step aimed to acquire the image of a region of interest inside the sample,  \n\nscanning at high spatial resolution (pixel size of 12 \u00b5m, energy settings 115 \u2013 190 kV and  \n\n80 \u2013 288 ?A), allowing an improved visualization of smaller pores.  \n\nAfter the image acquisition, median filters were applied before reconstruction in order \n\nto reduce random noise from the detector. Median filters consist of a nonlinear smoothing \n\nmethod used to reduce isolated noise without blurring sharp edges (LEE et al., 2013). \n\nReconstruction was done with the software CT Pro 3D (Nikon) and saved in raw format (tiff) \n\nand 8-bit gray scale resolution. \n\n\n\n27 \n\n2.2.3 Image Processing  \n\nImage processing was performed with the image analysis software FIJI/Image J \n\n(SCHINDELIN et al., 2012). Initially, the images were submitted to the preprocessing step in \n\nwhich covering denoising, edge enhancement, artifact removal and intensity bias correction \n\nwere applied over the images. The adaptive filter (OLLION et al., 2013) available in ImageJ \n\nwas used for noise removal.  \n\nThe segmentation process provides a way to separate the object of interest from the \n\nbackground, in this case, the pore space from the soil matrix. This step was performed using \n\nthe ImageJ thresholding tool (automated segmentation) which applies the local thresholding \n\nmethod combined with Histogram analysis. The local thresholding values are determined in a \n\nlocal environment (often defined by the radius of a circular neighborhood) and the local cut-off \n\nvalues are locally applied to the individual pixels of the image. Thus, darker areas in an image \n\nmight be extractable comparably as well as very bright areas, but this would not be possible \n\nwith a global threshold only, where specifically very dark areas shift into the background or \n\nmight be under-extracted. More information about segmentation methods can be found in \n\nIassonov, Gebrenegus and Tuller (2009). \n\nAfter the segmentation process, morphological operations of erosion-dilation were \n\napplied into binary images. Erosion-dilation is a mathematical technique to find the skeleton of \n\nthe pore space, the skeleton runs through the centers of the pores and throats and defines the \n\ntopology (LINDQUIST; VENKATARANGAN, 1999; LINDQUIST et al., 2000). \n\n2.2.4 Image Analysis \n\nImage analysis consisted of calculating the ? density, macroporosity (MP), Gama (?a) \n\nand pore surface area density (SA density) as specified in the following, using results from the \n\nBoneJ algorithm implemented in ImageJ. \n\n? density (connectivity density) \n\n? density (mm-3) was calculated by the quotient of the Euler number (?) and the volume \n\nof the image (mm\u00b3). As soil images with two spatial resolutions were available, the \n\ntransformation of the Euler number into ? density allows to compare the values without bias, \n\nsince when doing this operation, the dependence of the spatial resolution is removed. \n\n  \n\n\n\n28 \n\nThe Euler number (?), also called the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 characteristic, describes the shape \n\nor structure of a topological space regardless of the way it is bent. The Euler number is one of \n\nthe Minkowski functionals and a topological measure used for describing the connectivity of \n\nspatial structures (ARNS; KNACKSTEDT; MECKE, 2002; VOGEL; ROTH, 2001; VOGEL; \n\nWELLER; SCHL\u00dcTER, 2010). In 3D, the Euler number is calculated as: ? = N \u2013 C + H, where \n\nN is the number of isolated pores, C is the number of redundant connections or loops within the \n\npore space often referred as connectivity or genus and H is the number of completely enclosed \n\ncavities in the considered soil volume (VOGEL, 1997, VOGEL; ROTH, 2001). Increasing \n\npositive values of the Euler number indicate decreasing connectivity of the structure, and \n\ndecreasing negative values indicate increasing connectivity (VOGEL, 1997).  \n\nThe algorithm uses voxel neighborhoods to calculate the Euler number of the volume \n\nand adjusts this to give the contribution of the volume to the connectivity of the structure it was \n\nobtained from. Toriwaki and Yonekura (2002) present fundamental properties of topological \n\nstructure of a 3D digitized picture and provide a method to treat topology of digitized 3D figure. \n\nMacroporosity (MP) \n\nMacroporosity was obtained by the determination of the volume occupied by pores \n\nrelative to the total image volume. For the images with low spatial resolution, only pores larger \n\nthan 40 \u00b5m can be visualized; and for the images with high spatial resolution, pores larger than \n\n12 \u00b5m can be visualized and quantified. \n\nSA density \n\nPore surface area density (SA density, mm-1) was calculated by the sum of the pore \n\nsurface area (mm2) of each individual pore and divided by the image volume (mm3). The \n\nalgorithm measures the pore surface area from a surface mesh. \n\nGama (?a) \n\nGama (?a) is a dimensionless connectivity indicator for a specific phase (RENARD; \n\nALLARD, 2013) indicating individual pore clusters calculated by:  \n\n ?\n?\n\n??\nNi\n\ni\n\ni\n\na\n\na n\nN 1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n 2.1 \n\nwhere each cluster of phase a has a label i and a size ni, Nl is the number of clusters and Nn is \n\nthe number of all phase a voxels.  \n\n\n\n29 \n\n?a has a lower value when the porous system presents several isolated and non-\n\nconnected clusters of macropores; however, if the porous system is dominated by at least one \n\nlarge interconnected macropore, ?a has large value. Cluster labeling is typically achieved with \n\na fast method by Hoshen and Kopelman (1976). ?a has the advantage over the popular Euler \n\nnumber that it is bounded by [0, 1] and less sensitive to noise (SCHL\u00dcTER et al., 2014; \n\nSCHL\u00dcTER; VOGEL, 2016). \n\n2.2.5 Retention curve from soil images \n\nThe pores-size distribution was computed with the maximum inscribed sphere method \n\nas implemented in BoneJ from ImageJ (HILDEBRAND; R\u00dcEGSEGGER, 1997; \n\nDOUGHERTY; KUNZELMANN, 2007; DOUBE et al., 2010), where the pore radii were \n\ndetermined by the volume of the inscribed sphere.  \n\nIn order to obtain the ?-h relation, pore diameters were transformed into pressure head \n\nh according to the Young-Laplace equation: \n\n \ngr\n\nh\n?\n\n?? cos2\n?  2.2 \n\nwhere, ? is the water surface tension (? = 0.073 N m-1 at 20 \u00b0C), ? is contact angle (normally \n\nconsidered to be 0\u00ba for pure water and clean mineral surfaces), ? is the water specific gravity (? \n\n= 1000 kg m-3), g is gravity (g = 9.81 m s-2 at the Earth surface), and r is the pore radius [m]. \n\nThe volumetric water content, ?, was assumed to be equal to the volume occupied by the \n\ncorrespondent pore relative to the total volume.  \n\nHydraulic properties were expressed according to the Van Genuchten \u2013 Mualem \n\nequations (VAN GENUCHTEN, 1980):  \n\n ? ?? ? 1\n1\n\n1\n?\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n? n\n\nn\n\nrs\n\nr\ne hS ?\n\n??\n\n??\n 2.3 \n\nwhere Se is the effective saturation, ? is the water content, ?s is the saturated water content; ?r, \n\nresidual water content; ? and n are empirical constants affecting the shape of the retention curve; \n\nl is a pore-connectivity parameter. The parameters for Equation 2.3 were obtained with the \n\nnonlinear least-squares optimization program RETC (VAN GENUCHTEN; LEIJ; YATES, \n\n1991; YATES et al., 1992). \n\n\n\n30 \n\n2.2.6 Evaporation method \n\nFor water-based determinations, a simultaneous measurement of ?(h) and K(h) was \n\nconducted using the evaporation method of Schindler (1980), a simplification of the Wind \n\n(1968) approach. The simplified method of Schindler uses pressure head measurements, h1 and \n\nh2, at only two different depths, z1 and z2. The same undisturbed soil samples used for image \n\nacquisition, taken in the PVC rings, was employed for the evaporation experiment. Samples \n\nwere slowly saturated by capillarity, after which two Hyprop tensiometers (HYdraulic \n\nPROPerty analyzer, UMS, Munich) (SCHINDLER et al., 2010) were vertically inserted in the \n\nsample through drilled holes with centers at 50 (z1) and 25 mm (z2) vertical distance from the \n\nsample bottom. The sample was sealed at the bottom and placed on a balance, leaving the \n\nsurface free to evaporate. Tensions (h) at two heights and sample masses (M) were measured at \n\npre-determinate time intervals. The hydraulic gradient (im) was calculated from the tension \n\nvalues and the tensiometer distance. The flux density (q) was derived from the soil water-mass \n\ndifference ?M per surface area (A) and time unit (?t). Single points of the water-retention curve \n\nwere calculated based on water loss per volume of the core sample at time t and the mean \n\ntension in the sample at that time. The hydraulic conductivity (K) was calculated by   \n\n \nmitA\n\nV\nhK\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n2\n)(   2.4 \n\nwhere h  is the mean tension, averaged over the upper and the lower tensiometer and the time \n\ninterval, A is the cross-sectional area of the sample, ?V is the mass of evaporated water in time \n\ninterval ?t = t2 \u2013 t1, ? is the density of water, and im is the mean hydraulic gradient in the \n\ninterval, given by \n\n 1\n22\n\n22122111\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\nz\n\nzhtzht\n\nz\n\nzhtzht\nim\n\n,,,,\n  2.5 \n\n \n\nwhere 21,, zzth  indicates the tension at 50 mm and at 25 mm values at times t1 and t2, \n\nrespectively, and ?z is the vertical distance between the tensiometer positions. \n\nHydraulic properties were expressed according to the Van Genuchten \u2013 Mualem \n\nequations (VAN GENUCHTEN, 1980), equation 2.3 for retention and for hydraulic \n\nconductivity K: \n\n\n\n31 \n\n ? ?\n\n2\n1\n\n1\n\n111\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n???\n\n?\n\n?\n\nn\nn\n\nn\n\ne\nl\nes SSKK  2.6 \n\n \n\nwhere Ks is the hydraulic conductivity at saturation and l is a pore-connectivity parameter.  \n\nTo obtain the fitting parameters, Equations 2.3 and 2.6 were simultaneously fitted to the data \n\nfrom the evaporation experiments. \n\nThe hydraulic conductivity is affected by both by pore size distribution and by the \n\ncontinuity and tortuosity of flow path. The effects of these two factors is represented by the \n\nexponent l in Equation 2.6. In most studies, l is considered constant and equal to 0.5, as \n\ndetermined by Mualem (1976) on a dataset with 45 soils. \n\n2.2.7 Correlation of parameters and multiple regression analysis \n\nSpearman correlations were used to investigate the correlation between parameters from \n\nwater-based hydraulic parameters and pore-space image parameters. The Spearman correlation \n\nmatrix is used for non-parametric correlations, not requiring the assumption that the relationship \n\nbetween variables is linear, nor requiring quantitative variables (SIEGEL; CASTELLAN \n\nJ\u00daNIOR, 2006). \n\nFor calibration of hydraulic parameters as a function of image parameters, eight samples \n\nwere chosen randomly to perform a stepwise multiple regression analysis, thus obtaining the \n\nequation for each soil hydraulic parameter. The remaining four samples were used for \n\nvalidation, applying the calibrated equations to predict the soil hydraulic parameters and \n\ncomparing those to the water-based hydraulic parameters. \n\n2.3 Results and Discussion \n\n2.3.1 Image parameters \n\nTable 2.2 shows the pore space image parameters at low (40 \u00b5m) and high (12 \u00b5m) \n\nspatial resolution; as the images with high spatial resolution (12 \u00b5m) were obtained from \n\npreview images, only a portion of the sample volume was analyzed, resulting in different \n\nparameters values for both spatial resolutions. \n\n\n\n32 \n\nTable 2.2 \u2013 3D X-ray image parameters at low and high spatial resolution in the four analysed soils \n\nRhodic Ferralsol, Rhodic Lixisol, Xanthic Ferralsol and Rhodic Nitosol (three samples per \n\nsoil) \n\nLower spatial resolution (40 \u00b5m) \n\nSample MP (m3 m-3) SA density (mm-1) ?a  ? density (mm\n-3) \n\nRhodic Ferralsol - Sandy clay loam \n\n1 0.09 0.22 0.95 -0.14 \n\n2 0.04 0.08 0.77 -0.10 \n\n3 0.06 0.13 0.89 -0.07 \n\nMean \u00b1  SD 0.06 \u00b1  0.03 0.14 \u00b1 0.07 0.87 \u00b1 0.09 -0.10 \u00b1 0.04 \n\nRhodic Lixisol - Sandy clay loam \n\n1 0.20 0.57 0.99 -0.79 \n\n2 0.11 0.29 0.97 -0.78 \n\n3 0.18 0.53 0.99 -0.98 \n\nMean \u00b1  SD 0.16 \u00b1  0.05 0.46 \u00b1  0.15 0.98 \u00b1 0.01 -0.85 \u00b1 0.11 \n\nXanthic Ferralsol - Sandy clay loam \n\n1 0.02 0.05 0.79 -0.11 \n\n2 0.05 0.85 0.13 -0.36 \n\n3 0.05 0.70 0.12 -0.14 \n\nMean \u00b1  SD 0.04 \u00b1  0.02 0.53 \u00b1  0.43 0.35 \u00b1 0.38 -0.20 \u00b1 0.14 \n\nRhodic Nitosol - Clay \n\n1 0.14 0.40 0.99 -0.62 \n\n2 0.10 0.30 0.98 -0.52 \n\n3 0.11 0.34 0.99 -0.51 \n\nMean \u00b1  SD 0.12 \u00b1  0.02 0.35 \u00b1  0.05 0.99 \u00b1  0.01 -0.55 \u00b1 0.06 \n\nHigher spatial resolution (12 \u00b5m) \n\nSample MP (m3 m-3) SA density (mm-1) ?a  ? density (mm\n-3)  \n\nRhodic Ferralsol - Sandy clay loam \n\n1 0.15 0.57 0.89 -0.45 \n\n2 0.03 0.24 0.67 -1.80 \n\n3 0.07 0.07 0.90 -1.81 \n\nMean \u00b1  SD 0.08 \u00b1  0.06 0.29 \u00b1  0.25 0.82 \u00b1 0.13 -1.35 \u00b1 0.78 \n\nRhodic Lixisol - Sandy clay loam \n\n1 0.25 1.29 0.99 -26.09 \n\n2 0.12 0.54 0.96 -5.90 \n\n3 0.18 1.52 0.98 -8.45 \n\nMean \u00b1  SD 0.18 \u00b1  0.07 1.12 \u00b1  0.51 0.98 \u00b1 0.02 -13.48 \u00b1 10.99 \n\nXanthic Ferralsol - Sandy clay loam \n\n1 0.04 0.73 0.37 -1.76 \n\n2 0.09 0.92 0.60 -13.08 \n\n3 0.18 1.43 0.96 -24.57 \n\nMean \u00b1  SD 0.10 \u00b1  0.07 1.03 \u00b1  0.36 0.64 \u00b1 0.30 -13.14 \u00b1 11.41 \n\nRhodic Nitosol - Clay \n\n1 0.18 1.08 0.98 -0.01 \n\n2 0.16 0.96 0.97 -5.31 \n\n3 0.17 1.24 0.97 -2.99 \n\nMean \u00b1  SD 0.17 \u00b1  0.01 1.09 \u00b1  0.14 0.97 \u00b1 0.01 -2.77 \u00b1 2.66 \n\n \n\nPore space heterogeneity affects results between samples at the two spatial resolutions, \n\n40 \u00b5m and 12 \u00b5m, therefore, resulting in different values of pore space image parameters. Soil \n\nimages obtained with spatial resolution of 12 \u00b5m presented smaller values of the  \n\nEuler number and, consequently, of ? density, indicating a higher connectivity.  \n\n\n\n33 \n\nThis result is expected, since a higher spatial resolution allows to visualize smaller pores, \n\nincluding packing pores and intra-aggregate pores; however, part of soil porosity is not \n\nquantified by the image analysis due to the spatial resolution restriction. Also, higher values of \n\nmacroporosity were obtained on the images with the higher spatial resolution, since it is more \n\nlikely for a macropore to occupy a larger fraction of the image volume.  \n\nSoil image parameters are also dependent of the threshold employed, therefore different \n\nthreshold methods will result in different parameters values. Additionally, the method is \n\nsomehow subjective and different results are expected to be obtained for different observers. \n\nBaveye et al. (2010) conducted an investigation to determine how much variation exists among \n\nthe outcomes of various image thresholding strategies (including any image pre-treatment \n\ndeemed appropriate), routinely adopted by soil scientists. The authors found out that experts \n\nrely on very different approaches to threshold images of soils and that there is observer bias \n\nassociated with this thresholding; experts, relying on various combinations of subjective \n\nprocedures (e.g., manual contrast adjustment, visual thresholding) and automated steps, \n\nproduced thresholded images that in some cases vary significantly with respect to simple \n\nquantitative measures, like porosity. \n\n2.3.2 Soil hydraulic properties \n\nFigure 2.1 shows the water retention data obtained from the microtomography images \n\nand from the evaporation experiments. Results are consistent with the results obtained with \n\npore-size distribution from image analysis and measured retention data.  \n\nDue to image resolution, image analysis allows only the determination of the wet range \n\nof the curve. For images with 40 \u00b5m spatial resolution, the lower pore radius is 49.4 \u00b5m, \n\ncorresponding to pressure heads of -0.30 m; and for images with 12 \u00b5m spatial resolution, the \n\nlower pore radius is 24.3 \u00b5m, corresponding to pressure heads of -0.61 m. Probably the non-\n\nidentification/quantification of some smaller pores occurred due to the processes of \n\nsegmentation and morphological operations, in which small individual pores are identify as \n\nsolids or incorporated in a neighboring larger pore. In the binary image it is very difficult to \n\nobtain pores with spatial resolution size, because very small pores (with sizes close to the spatial \n\nresolution) join to other pores or are hidden in the process of both segmentation and \n\nmorphological operation.  \n\n\n\n34 \n\nThe part of the retention curve that can be measured using the water-based method with \n\nHyprop tensiometers (EE) is limited by tensiometer specifications. In our experiments we were \n\nable to measure down to -10 m, so the drier range could not be quantified. \n\nHydraulic conductivity functions for soils Rhodic Ferralsol, Rhodic Lixisol, Xanthic \n\nFerralsol and Rhodic Nitosol obtained from the evaporation experiments model fits are \n\nrepresented in Figure 2.2. In general, the Xanthic Ferralsol presents a lower hydraulic \n\nconductivity, corroborating with its high bulk density and sandy clay loam texture (Table 2.1); \n\nthis soil also presents a higher dispersion for parameters n and ? (Table 2.3), which reflects in \n\nits retention (Figure 2.1) and hydraulic conductivity (Figure 2.2) curves. The variability may be \n\ndue to natural soil spatial variability, indicating that the samples may have been smaller than \n\nthe Representative Elementary Volume.  \n\nParameter n (n > 1) is related to the pore-size distribution, higher values being associated \n\nwith a homogeneous pore size distribution; n influences the slope of the retention curve at its \n\ninflection, as seen for e.g. the Xanthic Ferralsol (Figure 2.1) with a  \n\nhigh n (Table 2.3). Parameter ? is related to the inverse of the air-entry pressure and scales the \n\nretention curve along the x-axis. Higher values of ? scale the curve closer to the y-axis making \n\nthe matric potential at inflection to increase and to correspond to larger pores. With respect to \n\nthe hydraulic conductivity (Figure 2.2), for the Rhodic Lixisol, the high value of n for sample \n\n3 (Table 2.3) made its values for K to be higher than for the other two samples; being also \n\nobserved for sample 1 of the Rhodic Nitosol. \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013  Volumetric water content as a function of matric potential (I \u2013 data acquired from image analysis, EE \u2013 data acquired with water-\n\nbased method (Hyprop tensiometers) \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10\n\nRhodic Lixisol\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10\n\n?\n(m\n\n3\nm\n\n-3\n)\n\nRhodic Ferralsol\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10\n\nh (- m)\n\nRhodic Nitosol\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10\n\n?\n(m\n\n3\nm\n\n-3\n)\n\nh (- m)\n\nEE 1 I 1 EE 2 I 2 EE 3 I 3\n\nXanthic Ferralsol\n\n\n\n36 \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Hydraulic conductivity functions for the four evaluated soils.

It should be observed that \n\nparameters ?s and ?r are mere fitting parameters without clear physical meaning. The water \n\ncontent obtained by oven drying is defined as zero, and is normally less than ?r. Water contents \n\nbelow the residual water content ?r are physically possible but cannot be investigated with the \n\nempirical model used here.  \n\nRegarding the l parameter, observed values ranged from -1.68 to 1.49. Negative values \n\nfor l are often reported (SCHUH; CLINE, 1990; KAVEH; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1992; YATES \n\net al., 1992; KOSUGI, 1999; SCHAAP; LEIJ, 2000; OH; KIM; KIM, 2015; PINHEIRO; VAN \n\nLIER; METSELAAR, 2017). Schuh and Cline (1990) reported l varying between -8.73 and \n\n14.80, for a data set of 75 soil samples. Schaap and Leij (2000) found  \n\nl = -1, as optimal value that minimized the root mean square error for 235 soil samples from all \n\ntexture range. A negative value of l implies in an increasing connectivity of water-filled pores \n\nwith decreasing soil moisture content, which intuitively does not seem realistic (VEREECKEN \n\net al., 2010). \n\nAlthough parameter l has been labeled an indicator of tortuosity and connectivity, its \n\nexact physical meaning is unclear (VOGEL, 2000; GHANBARIAN et al., 2013). Ghanbarian \n\net al. (2013) discussed the concept of tortuosity, its varying definitions in the literature, and \n\ntheir significance. They also highlight the issue if tortuosity is an intrinsic property of the \n\nmedium, of a process within the medium, or neither, being simply an adjustable parameter used \n\nto improve the agreement between theory and experiment. Because the tortuosity has a \n\npronounced saturation dependence, tortuosity cannot simply be a property of the medium itself \n\nbut must be derived from the actual paths of flow, conduction, or transport involved. Hoffmann-\n\nRiem, Van Genuchten and Fl\u00fchler (1999) concluded that models based on  \n\nEq. (2.6) should not be interpreted as being physically based. Schaap and Leij (2000) also treat \n\nl as an empirical parameter. \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nTable 2.3 \u2013 Fitting parameters for Van Genuchten equations \n\n Parameters \n\nSample ?s (m\n3 m-3) ?r (m\n\n3 m-3) ?

In a monotonic relationship, the variables tend to change together but not \n\nnecessarily at a constant rate. The Spearman correlation coefficient is based on the graded \n\nvalues of each variable, rather than the data. The negative sign of correlation means that the \n\nvariables vary in the opposite direction, that is, the higher categories of one variable are \n\nassociated with lower categories of the other variable. \n\nThe Spearman correlation matrix (Table 2.4) and p-values (Table 2.5),  \n\nat 5% of significance, show ?s, ? and n to have a monotonic association between the variables. \n\n?s and ? show a strong positive association with MP, while n was strongly associated to SA \n\ndensity. ?s showed a strong negative association with ? density; parameters l and ?r weak \n\nassociation with any image pore space parameter. \n\nTable 2.4 \u2013 Spearman correlation matrix \n\nParameters \n?s  \n(m3 m-3) \n\n?r  \n\n(m3 m-3) \n?

Although \n\nl and ?r show weak correlations to image parameters of pore space, the prediction of those \n\nparameters using image data was performed and plotted, in order to show the accuracy and \n\ndispersion. Predicted values of ?s were underestimated, while the predicted values  \n\nof n were overestimated. Results show that the employed statistical model (stepwise multiple \n\nregression) was not able to explain how pore space geometry relates to hydraulic property \n\nparameters, since for all hydraulic parameters the RMSE for validation was higher than the \n\nRMSE for validation.  \n\nThe use of the Van Genuchten (1980) model assumes that the pore size distribution of \n\nthe soil can be described by a single unimodal pore size distribution function, and that the pore \n\nsystem can be described as a bundle of capillaries with flow processes governed by the \n\nprinciples of capillary flow. Moreover, capillaries are filled either with water or with air, \n\nwithout accounting for film flow that may dominate in relatively dry soils (VEREECKEN et \n\nal., 2010). These assumptions, allied to uncertainties concerning the physical meaning of l and \n\nlimitations of the statistical model result in the low correlation between l and pore space image \n\nparameters. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013  Observed versus predicted hydraulic parameters using a multiple regression \n\nanalysis of image data \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3\n\nCalibration: RMSE = 0.02\nValidation: RMSE = 0.09\n\n?r\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4\n\nP\nre\n\nd\nic\n\nte\nd\n\nCalibration: RMSE = 0.01\nValidation: RMSE = 0.06\n\n?s\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n0 1 2 3\n\nCalibration: RSME = 0.03\nValidation: RSME = 0.33\n\nn\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n0 4 8 12\n\nP\nre\n\nd\nic\n\nte\nd\n\nCalibration: RMSE = 0.49\nValidation: RSME = 3.22\n\n?\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2\n\nP\nre\n\nd\nic\n\nte\nd\n\nObserved\n\nCalibration: RSME = 0.49\nValidation: RSME = 1.73\n\nl\n\n\n\n42 \n \n\nThe prediction of soil hydraulic properties through CT image analysis is still a challenge, \n\nprocesses that occur in the soil depend on several factors that must be quantified and included \n\nwith the characteristics of the pore space for an adequate prediction; along with the use of more \n\ncomplex hydraulic conductivity models that include information on the pore space shape and \n\narrangement. \n\nQuantification of soil characteristics though images is a powerful and promise \n\ntechnique, although there is still some limitations attached with the computer power, spatial \n\nresolution, lack of standard methodology to process and analyze soil images; this technique \n\nallows the quantification of several soil characteristics with only one image. \n\n2.4 Conclusions \n\nDetermination of soil hydraulic parameters using image analysis may be performed in a \n\nsmall range close to saturation (-0.0045 to -0.61 m), due to the current limitation of the spatial \n\nresolution of the microtomograph.  \n\nWeak correlations were obtained between measured hydraulic parameters from the Van \n\nGenuchten model and pore space image parameters through stepwise multiple regression \n\nanalysis, thus this statistical model was not able to explain how pore space geometry relates to \n\nhydraulic properties parameters from an empirical model. \n\n2.5 References \n\nARNS, C.; KNACKSTEDT, M.; MECKE, K.

Retention properties can be measured directly using field or \n\nlaboratory methods, but determining unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is more troublesome \n\nand commonly it is predicted from retention data, introducing an empirical parameter related to \n\ntortuosity and connectivity. The value of this parameter is usually not determined, but, instead, \n\na standard value is applied. We evaluated the sensitivity of the predictions of an agro-\n\nhydrological model to the tortuosity/connectivity parameter, applying its commonly used \n\nstandard value or determining its value in laboratory evaporation experiments using wet-range \n\ntensiometers, dry-range tensiometers, or both wet- and dry-range tensiometers. Four tropical \n\nsoils from Brazil were used for the analysis. Simulations with the agro-hydrological model were \n\nperformed for some years with distinct rainfall characteristics. \n\nKeywords: tortuosity factor, SWAP, soil hydraulic properties \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\nSoil hydraulic property (SHP) functions, i.e. the hydraulic conductivity and water \n\nretention functions, are essentials for vadose zone hydrological modeling applied to predict \n\nagronomic and ecological processes. Such models are used to simulate the transport of water, \n\nsolutes and heat in saturated and unsaturated soil zones. Richards\u2019s equation (RICHARDS, \n\n1948) based models integrated with plant growth modules can predict relative or absolute \n\nwater-limited crop yield (DROOGERS et al., 2004; MO et al., 2005; DE JONG VAN LIER; \n\nWENDROTH; VAN DAM, 2015), water use efficiency, nutrient transport (WOLF et al., 2003; \n\nPINTO et al., 2017), irrigation management (UTSET et al., 2004; RALLO et al., 2012), and \n\ncrop water availability (VAN WART; GRASSINI; CASMAN, 2013; IDEN; PETERS; \n\nDURNER, 2015; PINHEIRO; VAN LIER; METSELAAR, 2017), among other processes. \n\nWhereas retention properties can be measured directly using relatively simple field or \n\nlaboratory methods, determining hydraulic conductivity for unsaturated conditions is much \n\nmore troublesome and commonly it is predicted from retention data using pore size models or \n\nstatistical models. These models predict the hydraulic conductivity by integration of elementary \n\npore domains, represented by a range of pore radii, e.g. the models of Childs and Collis-George \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\n(1950), Burdine (1953) and Mualem (1976). To deal with the unknown pore space tortuosity \n\nand connectivity, an empirical parameter is introduced in these models. \n\nIn the Mualem (1976) hydraulic conductivity model, based on the capillary bundle \n\ntheory, a parameter l was introduced to account for eccentricity of the flow path. The value of \n\nl = 0.5 was obtained by Mualem (1976) using a data set of 45 soil samples. The physical \n\nmeaning of l is unclear and it may be considered as an integral of all model uncertainties \n\ntogether (VOGEL, 2000). \n\nComputed water balances are very sensitive to soil hydraulic parameters and therefore \n\ntheir accurate determination is essential to model hydrological processes (JOHRAR et al., \n\n2004). Vereecken et al. (1992) showed that the uncertainty in hydraulic parameters results in a \n\nconsiderable variation of simulated soil moisture supply capacity and of the downward flux \n\nbelow the root zone. \n\nIn comprehensive analyses of soil-plant-atmosphere relations involving agro-\n\nhydrological simulations, models are parameterized and calibrated to simulate involved \n\nprocesses under specific climate, soil and plant scenarios, which may be based on present data \n\nor refer to expected or otherwise possible scenarios. Generally, models are projected to provide \n\nfair pictures of the behavior of the studied systems under likely scenarios, though, the reliability \n\nof simulations depends on model parameterization. Soil properties play a very important role \n\nin agro-hydrological simulations, especially because SHP determine all water fluxes, those \n\ntowards the root system (driving plant growth), drainage and evaporation rate. \n\nEven when simple soil-water relations approaches are used like the plant-available water \n\ncalculated based on two water contents (field capacity and permanent wilting point), although \n\ncommonly assumed to be related only to retention properties, in a more detailed process-based \n\nanalysis those two water contents are determined by both water retention and pore connectivity \n\nviz. hydraulic conductivity (TAWARAKAVI; \u0160IM?NEK; SCHAAP, 2010; DE JONG VAN \n\nLIER; WENDROTH, 2016; ASSOULINE; OR, 2014).  \n\nSeveral methods of estimating SHP are currently available, however, most of them yield \n\nincomplete information, focusing only on water retention characteristics and pore size \n\ndistribution, lacking information on pore arrangement and connectivity. Most of the agro-\n\nhydrological simulations are run with water retention data only, which probably \n\nunderrepresents the process-based behavior of soil-plant-atmosphere systems. Regarding water \n\nretention, simpler indirect methods have been implemented, for instance, pedotransfer \n\nfunctions, which are predictive equations that relate more easily measurable general soil data \n\nto water retention and hydraulic parameters (BOUMA; VAN LANEN, 1987; BOUMA, 1989; \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nVAN DEN BERG et al., 1997). However, pedotransfer functions, besides of being subject to \n\nstatistical errors, require a reliable and large dataset, and are mostly applied to soil water \n\nretention. \n\nAnalyzing evaporation experiment data using inverse solution methods stands as a \n\npowerful tool to characterize SHP for a large range of soil water contents (\u0160IM?NEK; \n\nWENDROTH; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1998; PINHEIRO; VAN LIER; METSELAAR, 2017). \n\nIn this study, we assessed soil hydraulic properties from evaporation experiments for different \n\npressure head ranges. The tortuosity factor l was fitted using water retention curves determined \n\nin the traditional pressure chamber desorption method. In order to analyze the adequacy of the \n\nparameterized SHP in predicting soil hydraulic processes and to pinpoint their effect on agro-\n\nhydrological simulations, a functional evaluation was performed for years with distinct rainfall \n\ncharacteristics under climatic conditions of a southeast Brazilian climate. \n\n3.2 Material and Methods \n\n3.2.1 Soil sampling \n\nUndisturbed and disturbed soil samples were collected in four soils from distinct soil \n\nclasses (Rhodic Ferralsol, Rhodic Lixisol, Xanthic Ferrasol and Rhodic Nitossol) located in S\u00e3o \n\nPaulo State, Brazil. Particle size distribution, bulk and particle density from the sampled soils \n\nare shown in Table 1. Both soils were sampled in their surface horizon, between the depths of \n\n0.1 and 0.3 m. Two different sizes of undisturbed samples were collected: larger samples in \n\nPVC rings (75 mm diameter and 75 mm height) for subsequent use in the wet-range evaporation \n\nexperiments, and smaller samples in aluminum rings (50 mm diameter and 30 mm height) to \n\nbe used in the traditional desorption experiments and for the measurement of saturated \n\nhydraulic conductivity (Ks) using a constant head permeameter.

Tensions from -0.1 to -0.6 m were applied using a tension \n\nTable and for higher tensions (-1 to -150 m) a porous plate pressure chamber was used.  \n\nThe final water content of the soil sample was determined by comparing to oven-dry  \n\n(105 \u00b0C) mass. \n\nThe wet-range evaporation experiments (EEwet, measured pressure head \n\nbetween -1 and -10 m) were conducted using the larger undisturbed soil samples which were \n\nequipped with two Hyprop tensiometers (SCHINDLER et al., 2010) vertically inserted in the \n\nsample through drilled holes with centers at 25 and 50 mm vertical distance from the sample \n\nbottom. The methodology used to determine unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was the \n\nsimplified evaporation method (SCHINDLER, 1980; PETERS; DURNER, 2008), a \n\nsimplification of the Wind (1968) approach. The soil-water flux was determined by the \n\nmeasurement of water tension using the two tensiometer cells at different positions. Soil \n\nsamples were saturated by capillarity and tensiometers inserted and the sample bottom was \n\nsealed. The assembly was placed on an auto-logging balance and the measurement cycle was \n\nstarted. The pressure head and sample mass were recorded at pre-determined times until the \n\nmass of the sample reached a constant value. At the end of the measurement, the final water \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\ncontent of the soil sample was determined by oven drying at 105 \u00b0C. The mass and pressure \n\nhead measurements were used for the calculation of the soil-water flux.  \n\nThe dry-range evaporation experiments (EEdry, measured pressure head range \n\nbetween -1.5 and -165 m) were carried out with disturbed soil samples. A polyvinyl chloride \n\nring (0.1 m high and 0.1 m in diameter) was filled with air-dry and sieved soil material and \n\nslowly saturated with water from bottom to top by imbibition from a shallow layer of tap water. \n\nAfter that, the bottom was sealed and three polymer tensiometers were horizontally inserted in \n\nthe sample through drilled holes with centers at 25, 50 and 75 mm vertical distance from the \n\nsample surface (VAN DER PLOEG et al., 2010; DURIGON et al., 2011; PINHEIRO; VAN \n\nLIER; METSELAAR, 2017). Then, the set of soil sample and tensiometers was placed on a \n\nprecision balance. Measurements of ring sample weight and pressure heads were automatically \n\nlogged every 10 min. The evaporation experiment was finished when the upper tensiometer \n\nreached a pressure head value below -165 m, which took in the order  \n\nof 3 weeks. At the end of the measurement, the final water content of the soil sample was \n\ndetermined by oven drying at 105 \u00b0C. \n\n3.2.3 Soil hydraulic parameterization (SHP) \n\nUnsaturated SHP were assumed to be defined by K-?-h relations (equations 1 and 2) \n\ndescribed by the Van Genuchten-Mualem model (VAN GENUCHTEN, 1980).  \n\n \n\n \n? ? 1)/1(1 ???? nnh?\n\n 3.1 \n\n ? ?? ?2)/1(1)1/(11 nnnl\ns\n\nKK\n??\n\n?????  3.2 \n\nwith )/()(\nrsr\n\n???? ???? ; ?, ?r and ?s are water content, residual water content and saturated \n\nwater content (m3 m-3), respectively; h is pressure head (m), K and Ks are hydraulic conductivity \n\nand saturated hydraulic conductivity, respectively (m d-1); and ? (m-1), n and l are fitting \n\nparameters. \n\nFive sets of SHP were obtained for each soil: \n\n1.  Using the inverse solution obtained from evaporation experiment data from the \n\nwet range experiments (EEwet) \n\n2.  Using the inverse solution obtained from evaporation experiment data from the \n\ndry range experiments (EEdry)  \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\n3.  Using the inverse solution obtained from evaporation experiment data from the \n\nwet and dry range experiments together (EEwet+dry) \n\n4.  Using the retention data from tension Table / pressure chamber, measured Ks and \n\nl = 0.5 (RCl=0.5),  \n\n5.  Using the retention data from tension Table / pressure chamber, measured Ks and \n\nl fitted according to K values obtained in EEwet+dry (RCl-fit) \n\n \n\nThe first three sets (EEwet, EEdry, and EEwet+dry) were obtained by an inverse one-\n\ndimensional solution using Hydrus-1D (\u0160IM?NEK; VAN GENUCHTEN; \u0160EJNA, 2008). \n\nHydrus-1D implements a Marquardt-Levenberg type parameter estimation technique for \n\ninverse optimization of soil hydraulic parameters (\u0160IM?NEK; VAN GENUCHTEN; \u0160EJNA, \n\n2012). The upper and lower water flow boundary conditions were set as atmospheric boundary \n\ncondition and constant flux (zero), respectively. Surface evaporation flux for each time interval \n\nwas calculated from observed mass difference over a time interval and used as a time variable \n\nboundary conditions. The following information from the experimental data was included into \n\nthe objective function: (i) pressure heads measured at the two (for EEwet) or three (for EEdry) \n\ndepths over time and (ii) the final soil water content. In order to achieve robust minimization, \n\ndata associated to the different soil textural classes available in the soil hydraulic catalog of \n\nHydrus-1D were used as starting values. \n\nThe water retention parameters SHP for the RC methods were obtained from retention \n\ndata using the nonlinear least-squares optimization program RETC (VAN GENUCHTEN et al., \n\n1991; YATES et al., 1992). For RCl=0.5, l was considered to be equal to 0.5 for all soils. For \n\nRCl-fit, the value of l was optimized using the values of K observed in EEwet+dry. \n\n3.2.4 Agro-hydrological simulations \n\nIn order to functionally analyze the effect of the different protocols to achieve  \n\nsoil hydraulic parameterization using agro-hydrological simulations, we used the  \n\nSWAP model (KROES et al., 2008) to simulate soils cropped with maize. Weather data were \n\nretrieved from the University of S\u00e3o Paulo weather station in Piracicaba, Brazil  \n\n(22\u00ba 42\u2019 30\u201d S; 47\u00ba 38\u2019 00\u201d W, 546 m) for three distinct years in terms of rainfall: high rainfall \n\n(1995; 784 mm of rain during the crop growing season from February 1 to June 30), low rainfall \n\n(2014; 266 mm) and average rainfall (2011; 581 mm). The lower boundary condition for \n\nhydrological simulation was considered as free drainage, with a maximum rooting depth of 1 m. \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nFigure 3.1 shows the rainfall, maximum temperature and minimum temperature in Piracicaba \n\nfor the three years from one month before seeding to the end of the simulated crop cycle. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013  Rainfall, maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature (Tmin) observed \n\nat the Piracicaba weather station during the wet (1995), average (2011) and dry \n\n(2014) cropping seasons used in simulations \n\n  \n\n-50\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n1-Jan 1-Feb 1-Mar 1-Apr 1-May 1-Jun\n\nT\n (\n\n\u00ba \nC\n\n)\n\nR\na\nin\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nDate\n\nHigh rainfall\n\nTmax\n\nTmin\n\n-60\n\n-50\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n1-Jan 1-Feb 1-Mar 1-Apr 1-May 1-Jun\n\nT\n (\n\n\u00ba \nC\n\n)\n\nR\na\nin\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nDate\n\nAverage rainfall\n\nTmax\n\nTmin\n\n-60\n\n-50\n\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n1-Jan 1-Feb 1-Mar 1-Apr 1-May 1-Jun\n\nT\n (\n\n\u00ba \nC\n\n)\n\nR\na\nin\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nDate\n\nLow rainfall\n\nTmax\n\nTmin\n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nThe SWAP model simulates water flow, solute transport and plant growth in a soil\u2013\n\nwater\u2013atmosphere\u2013plant environment.

Equation 3.3 is solved numerically describing the ?\u2013h\u2013K relation by the Mualem\u2013\n\nvan Genuchten equations (MUALEM, 1976; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1980).  \n\nTo estimate the sink term S(h), the reduction function proposed by Feddes et al. (1976) \n\nand Feddes, Kowalik and Zaradny (1978) implemented in the SWAP model was used. It \n\ncomputes relative plant transpiration based on five threshold pressure heads (Table 3.2). \n\nConsequently, the prediction of crop water stress and crop transpiration under specific scenarios \n\ndepends greatly on soil hydraulic parameterization, a poor parameterization being likely to \n\nbring about unreliable outcomes leading to possibly erroneous conclusions. \n\nTable 3.2 \u2013 Threshold pressure head values of the Feddes, Kowalik and Zaradny (1978) \n\nreduction function for maize according to Taylor and Ashcroft (1972) \n\nParameter Description Value \n\nh1 No water extraction at higher pressure heads 0 \n\nh2 h below which optimum RWU starts  -10 \n\nh3h h below which RWU reduction starts at high potential transpiration -300 \n\nh3l h below which RWU reduction starts at low potential transpiration -600 \n\nh4 No water extraction at lower pressure heads -3000 \n\n3.3 Results and Discussion \n\n3.3.1 Soil hydraulic parameterization \n\nThe five sets of SHP for each soil are shown in Table 3.3. Respective RMSE values \n\ncorrespond to each specific parameter fitting procedure. For RCl=0.5, the parameter fitting was \n\nperformed as function of ? and the RMSE was calculated accordingly. For RCl-fit, RMSE refers \n\nto the observed hydraulic conductivity data from the EEwet+dry and to the predicted K for the \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\noptimized l. The RMSE of EEdry was calculated using h values; RMSE for EEwet+dry was \n\ncalculated related to K; for EEwet, RMSE was calculated using log K. \n\nWhen parameter fitting is based on the dry range alone, parameters at saturated \n\nconditions (?s and Ks) should be understood as mere fitting parameters and cannot be interpreted \n\nas if they were really measured at saturation. Extrapolation beyond the range of pressure heads \n\nmeasured during the evaporation experiment is associated with a high level of uncertainty \n\n(\u0160IM?NEK; WENDROTH; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1998). \n\nTable 3.3 \u2013 Optimized van Genuchten-Mualem parameters (Eqs. 3.1 and 3.2) for the sampled \n\nsoils, and RMSE values  \n\nParameterization \n?s  \n(m3 m-3) \n\n?r \n\n(m3 m-3) \n\n? \n\n(m-1) \nn l \n\nKs \n\n(m d-1) \nRMSE \n\n Rhodic Ferralsol  \n\nRCl=0.5 0.37 0.16 28.79 1.25 0.50 2.85 0.055 (?) \n\nRCl-fit 0.37 0.16 28.79 1.25 -2.18 2.85 7.685 (log K) \n\nEEwet 0.30 0.16 7.70 1.50 0.00 6.47 0.068 (log K) \n\nEEdry 0.31 0.16 0.64 1.16 -1.00 0.006 0.047 (h, m) \n\nEEwet+dry 0.30 0.22 17.58 1.20 0.00 27.51 0.623 (K, m d\n-1) \n\n Rhodic Lixisol  \n\nRCl=0.5 0.43 0.09 11.20 1.22 0.50 3.15 0.021 (?) \n\nRCl-fit 0.43 0.09 11.20 1.22 -1.42 3.15 6.911 ((log K) \n\nEEwet 0.40 0.09 13.22 1.51 0.00 3.10 0.061 (log K) \n\nEEdry 0.22 0.07 0.003 1.20 4.36 0.15 0.03 (h, m) \n\nEEwet+dry 0.40 0.00 94.26 1.10 -4.05 75.00 0.293 (K, m d\n-1) \n\n Xanthic Ferrasol  \n\nRCl=0.5 0.28 0.10 2.09 1.37 0.50 0.03 0.008 (?) \n\nRCl-fit 0.28 0.10 2.09 1.37 -1.1 0.03 5.698 (log K) \n\nEEwet 0.28 0.09 3.16 1.88 -0.87 0.26 0.099 (log K) \n\nEEdry 0.24 0.18 0.003 1.08 0.00 0.003 0.00 (h, m) \n\nEEwet+dry 0.28 0.19 6.97 4.28 -1.84 21.18 0.05 (K, m d\n-1) \n\n Rhodic Nitossol  \n\nRCl=0.5 0.49 0.00 8.95 1.09 0.50 0.62 0.013 (?) \n\nRCl-fit 0.49 0.00 8.95 1.09 -7.10 0.62 6.184 (log K) \n\nEEwet 0.37 0.10 5.92 1.19 -0.56 4.20 0.066 (log K) \n\nEEdry 0.29 0.13 0.44 1.12 0.00 0.25 0.03 (h, m) \n\nEEwet+dry 0.37 0.21 7.64 1.32 -1.31 2.53 0.018 (K, m d\n-1) \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\nFigure 3.2 shows pressure head (h) as function of volumetric water content (?) for the \n\nparameterization methods. Retention curve parameters for RCl=0.5 and RCl-fit were obtained \n\nfrom the same procedure and are identified in this Figure by RC. The fitting process in the \n\nEEwet+dry parameterization fitted the parameter values between EEwet and EEdry values, i.e., ?s \n\nEEwet+dry ? ?s EEwet and ?r EEwet+dry ? ?r EEdry. The shape of the EEwet+dry retention curve for \n\nthe Xanthic Ferralsol (Figure 3.2) is a result of the high value of ?r obtained for EEdry (Table \n\n3.3). \n\nThe discontinuity observed in Figure 3.2 between curves from different \n\nparameterizations may be due to the use of disturbed (EEdry) and undisturbed (EEwet and RC) \n\nsoil samples in the different experiments. The traditional pressure chamber desorption curve \n\nRC tends to overestimate soil-water content close to saturation, whereas in the dry range curves \n\ncome together. The fitted water retention model does not take into account adsorptive forces \n\n(LI; WARDLAW, 1986; LENORMAND, 1990; NIMMO, 1991, PETERS, 2013), it only \n\naccounts for capillary water retention, and according to Vereecken et al. (2010) this may lead \n\nto some undesirable drawbacks. Theoretically, the soil-water retention curve is measured under \n\nequilibrium conditions; however, practically, when measuring the soil-water retention curve \n\ne.g., using the porous plate pressure method, as the soil becomes drier, it deviates further from \n\nequilibrium (HUNT; SKINNER, 2005), this may be due to the lack of equilibrium at relatively \n\nhigh tensions which correspond to very low hydraulic conductivity, not providing equilibrium \n\nconditions. \n\n  \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\nSoil hydraulic conductivity is affected not only by soil pore size distribution \n\n(information contained in the retention curve), but also by pore continuity and tortuosity, which \n\ndetermine the flow path. The inclusion of parameter l in Equation , supposed to account for the \n\ncorrelation between pores and the flow path tortuosity, enhances the agreement between \n\ntheoretical and experimental curves (MUALEM, 1976). For that reason, the use of a fixed value \n\nfor l, like 0.5 as found for the Mualem (1976) data set, causes a mismatch in many soils and is \n\nlikely to increase the uncertainty in hydrological simulations. According to Pachepsky (1990), \n\nthe assumed constant value of l = 0.5 is in disagreement with the fact that the tortuosity factor \n\nstrongly depends on soil structure and texture in addition to its dependence on soil moisture \n\ncontent. Assouline and Or (2013) found that the value of  \n\nthe l (Equation 3.2) depends on the specific soil-fluid properties and varies considerably for \n\ndifferent soils. \n\n \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013  Volumetric water content as function of soil matric potential for each soil; dots represent measured values and lines are fits. \n\n \n\n    \n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.1 1 10 100\n\n?\n(m\n\n3\nm\n\n-3\n)\n\nh (-m)\n\nRC\nEE wet\nEE dry\n\nRhodic Ferralsol\n\nEEwet\n\nEEdry\n\nRC\nEEwet+dry\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.1 1 10 100\n\n?\n(m\n\n3\nm\n\n-3\n)\n\nh (-m)\n\nRC\n\nEE wet\n\nEE dry\n\nRhodic Lixisol\n\nEEwet+dry\n\nEEwet\n\nEEdry\n\nRC\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.1 1 10 100\n\n?\n(m\n\n3\nm\n\n-3\n)\n\nh (-m)\n\nRC\n\nEE wet\n\nEE dry\n\nXanthic Ferrasol\n\nEEwet+dry\n\nEEwet\n\nEEdry\n\nRC\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.1 1 10 100\n\n?\n(m\n\n3\nm\n\n-3\n)\n\nh (-m)\n\nRC\n\nEE wet\n\nEE dry\n\nRhodic Nitossol\n\nEEdry\n\nRC\n\nEEwet+dry\nEEwet\n\n\n\n59 \n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as function of soil matric potential; dots represent measured values and lines are fits \n\n  \n\n     \n\n0.001\n\n0.1\n\n10\n\n1000\n\n100000\n\n10000000\n\n1 10 100\n\nK\n (\n\n\u00b5\nm\n\n d\n-1\n\n)\n\nh (-m)\n\nEE wet\n\nEE dry\n\nRhodic Ferralsol\n\nRCl = 0.5\nRCl-Fit l = -2.18\n\nEEwet\n\nEEdry\n\nEEwet+dry\n\n0.0001\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n100\n\n10000\n\n1000000\n\n1 10 100\n\nK\n (\n\n\u00b5\nm\n\n d\n-1\n\n)\n\nh (-m)\n\nEE wet\nEE dry\n\nRhodic Lixisol\n\nRCl-Fit l = -1.42\n\nEEwet+dry\n\nEEwet\n\nEEdry\n\nRCl = 0.5\n\n0.000001\n\n0.0001\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n100\n\n10000\n\n1000000\n\n1 10 100\n\nK\n (\n\n\u00b5\nm\n\n d\n-1\n\n)\n\nh (-m)\n\nEE wet\n\nEE dry\n\nXanthic Ferrasol\n\nRCl-Fit l = - 1.1\n\nRCl = 0.5\n\nEEwet+dry\n\nEEwet\n\nEEdry\n\n0.0001\n\n0.01\n\n1\n\n100\n\n10000\n\n1000000\n\n1 10 100\n\nK\n (\n\n\u00b5\nm\n\n d\n-1\n\n)\n\nh (-m)\n\nEE wet\n\nEE dry\n\nRhodic Nitossol\n\nRCl-Fit l = - 7.1\n\nEEdry\n\nEEwet\n\nEEwet+dry\n\nRCl = 0.5\n\n\n\n60 \n \n\nObserved values of the l parameter in our soils ranged from around -7 to +4 (Table 3.3). \n\nNegative values for l are often reported (SCHUH; CLINE, 1990; KAVEH; VAN \n\nGENUCHTEN, 1992; YATES et al., 1992; KOSUGI, 1999; SCHAAP; LEIJ, 2000; OH; KIM; \n\nKIM, 2015; PINHEIRO; VAN LIER; METSELAAR, 2017). Schaap and Leij (2000) found l \n\n= -1, as optimal value that minimizes root mean square error, on 235 soil samples on all texture \n\nrange. Leij, Russell and Lesch (1997) obtained a mean value of l = -0.72 when  \n\n401 pairs of water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity data were considered. A \n\nnegative value of l implies that the connectivity of water-filled pores increases with decreasing \n\nsoil moisture content, which intuitively does not seem realistic (VEREECKEN et al., 2010). \n\nTherefore, some authors (HOFFMANN-RIEM; VAN GENUCHTEN; FL\u00dcHLER, 1999; \n\nSCHAAP; LEIJ, 2000) suggest that l should be treated merely as an empirical parameter \n\nwithout physical meaning. \n\n3.3.2 Agro-hydrological simulations \n\nIn addition to the numerical interpretation of parameter values, a functional \n\ninterpretation will reveal the effect of parameter differences on soil processes as simulated by \n\na hydrological model. Employing Richards equation-based models with a detailed description \n\nof soil-root zone processes allows to evaluate how different soil hydraulic parameterizations \n\nmay impact model predictions of key processes in the soil-plant-atmosphere system.  \n\nThe simulated pressure head values at 10 cm depth during the maize crop cycle using \n\nthe different set of SHP (Figure 3.4) show the stress occurrence by drought or water excess for \n\nthe Rhodic Nitossol at the three rainfall scenarios. Figure 3.5 shows the same data for the \n\naverage rainfall year in the four studied soils. The threshold pressure head that defines the onset \n\nof stress is based on the Feddes parameters compiled by Taylor and Ashcroft (1972) for the \n\nmaize crop (Table 3.2). Pressure head values between thresholds h2 and h3 represent the \n\noptimum range for crop growth with absence of water stress. \n\nIn general, simulations using SHP from RC and RCl=0.5 predicted very short stress \n\nperiods, while the other methods produced more restrictive scenarios. For the dry year, SHP \n\nobtained from the retention curve (with and without l fitting) and especially from EEdry, \n\nsimulated stress by water excess. \n\nIn every period in which there is accumulation of rainfall and/or intense rainfall event, \n\nEEdry, RCl=0.5 and RCl-fit simulates an anoxic stress (h &lt;h2), only at the Rhodic Lixisol \n\n(Figure 3.5) h decrease below h2 also for the EEwet+dry parameterization.

Thus, the anoxic stress is sensible to \n\nvalues of Ks. In the case of Rhodic Lixisol for EEwet+dry parameterization, besides a high value \n\nof Ks, EEwet+dry retention curve and hydraulic conductivity curve present low inclination, which \n\ncauses low reduction of water volumetric content with increase of pressure.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nFigure 3.4 \u2013  Pressure head simulated at 10 cm depth for the Rhodic Nitossol during the wet, \n\naverage and dry year.

When these soils approach dry conditions, a small reduction of the volumetric water \n\ncontent leads to a strong decrease in the potential. For the Rhodic Lixisol, Xanthic Ferralsol \n\nand Rhodic Nitosol, EEdry and EEwet simulate higher drought stress (Figure 3.5); while in \n\nRhodic Ferralsol, EEwet+dry is the parametrization that simulates the highest drought stress. \n\nFigure 3.2 shows the low inclination of the retention curve for the mentioned parameterizations \n\nthat simulate drought stress and the respective soils. Values of h above h4 are also associated \n\nwith a low inclination of the retention curve and occurs especially when atmospheric demand \n\nis high, more often during the dry year (Figure 3.4). \n\nRCl=0.5 and RCl-fit at optimal conditions (h2 ? h ? h3) have a similar behavior, however, \n\nRCl-fit simulates higher pressure heads, due to its higher hydraulic conductivity, caused by the \n\nnegative value of tortuosity factor. Under the same optimal condition for the Xanthic Ferralsol, \n\nsimulated values of h are very similar for both RCl=0.5 and RCl-fit (l = -1.1).  \n\nWhen h > h2, their behavior becomes different. \n\nRCl=0.5, RCl-fit and EEdry, especially, simulated stresses by water excess at high and \n\naverage rainfall, causing a drop in the simulated relative crop yield (Figure 3.6). EEwet did not \n\nsimulate stress by water excess for any year, not even for the wet year. Apparently, \n\nparametrization of only the dry part did not allow a proper simulation of near-saturated \n\nconditions, not resulting in excess water stress as simulated by EEwet. \n\nSimulations with EEdry yielded different results than EEwet and EEwet+dry, especially for \n\nthe wet and average year; thus, we can conclude that parameterization only for the dry-range is \n\nnot adequate for simulations when wet condition are dominating. Figure 3.5 highlights this \n\ncondition for the Rhodic Lixisol and Xanthic Ferrasol during the average year, where the EEdry \n\nparameterization simulated very different conditions than other parameterizations, especially \n\nwhen compared to EEwet and EEwet+dry.  \n\nHupet, Van Dam and VanClooster (2004) investigated the impact of within-field \n\nvariability in the soil hydraulic properties on actual transpiration and dry matter yield for three \n\ndifferent climate scenarios. They also evaluated sensitivity of the simulated actual transpiration \n\nand dry matter yield to soil hydraulic parameters, which increases with the dryness of the \n\nclimate. Their simulation results showed very different results of the agro-hydrological \n\nsimulations according to the climatic scenarios (wet, average and dry year). The sensitivity of \n\nthe actual transpiration rate and the dry matter to the soil hydraulic parameters (?s, n, ? and Ks) \n\nwas often very similar, being a direct consequence of conceptualizations in agro-hydrological \n\nmodels to reduce the daily potential gross CO2 assimilation rate. \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nFigure 3.5 \u2013 Simulated pressure head at 10 cm depth for the Rhodic Ferralsol, Rhodic Lixisol, Xanthic Ferrasol and Rhodic Nitossol during the \n\naverage year \n\n \n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\n280\n300\n320\n340\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\n1000000\n\n1-Feb 1-Mar 1-Apr 1-May 1-Jun\n\nR\na\nin\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nP\nre\n\nss\nu\nre\n\n h\ne\na\nd\n (\n\n-c\nm\n\n)\n\nh3\n\nh2\n\nh4\n\nRhodic Ferralsol\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\n280\n300\n320\n340\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\n1000000\n\n1-Feb 1-Mar 1-Apr 1-May 1-Jun\n\nR\na\nin\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nP\nre\n\nss\nu\nre\n\n h\ne\na\nd\n (\n\n-c\nm\n\n)\n\nh3\n\nh2\n\nh4\n\nRhodic Lixisol\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\n280\n300\n320\n340\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\n1000000\n\n1-Feb 1-Mar 1-Apr 1-May 1-Jun\n\nR\na\nin\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nP\nre\n\nss\nu\n\nre\n h\n\ne\na\nd\n\n (\n-c\n\nm\n)\n\nDate\n\nEE dry EE wet+dry\n\nh3\n\nh2\n\nh4\n\nRhodic Nitossol\n\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\n280\n300\n320\n340\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n100000\n\n1000000\n\n1-Feb 1-Mar 1-Apr 1-May 1-Jun\n\nR\na\nin\n\nfa\nll\n\n (\nm\n\nm\n)\n\nP\nre\n\nss\nu\nre\n\n h\ne\na\nd\n (\n\n-c\nm\n\n)\n\nDate\n\nRC l = 0.5 RC l fit EE wet\n\nh3\n\nh2\n\nh4\n\nXanthic Ferrasol\n\n\n\n65 \n \n\nFigure 3.6 shows the relative yield, simulated by the SWAP model, for the particular \n\ncase of the Rhodic Nitossol cropped with maize during the wet, average and dry year, while \n\nFigure 3.7 shows the maize relative yield simulated for the average year at the fours soils \n\nstudied, using the five soil hydraulic parameterizations. Relative yield was calculated by the \n\nquotient between potential yield and water-limited yield. Potential yield takes into account solar \n\nradiation, temperature, CO2, genetic potential of the plant, while the water-limited yield also \n\ntakes into account water availability, which in our case, was simulated based on Feddes, \n\nKowalik and Zaradny (1978) reduction function.  \n\nIn well drained soils during periods with average and high rainfall, the relative yield is \n\nexpected to reach values close to unity. In our simulations, only the SHP obtained from EEwet+dry \n\n(the widest range of evaluated water contents) predicted relative yields close to the maximum. \n\nThe simulation using SHP from EEwet also reached values close to 1. For periods with rainfall \n\nsupply, pressure heads of cropped soils hardly ever drop to very negative values, therefore, the \n\nSHP obtained from wet range experiments may be supposed to be able to yield good simulation \n\nresults.  \n\nThe simulations predicted low relative yield for the Xanthic Ferralsol for all five \n\nparameterizations (Figure 3.7), especially for EEdry, due to the simulated stresses by drought \n\nand water excess (Figure 3.5). For all five parameterization methods this soil presented low \n\nvalues of ?s, due to the low total porosity (0.286 m\n3m-3, Table 3.1), and high values of ?r, \n\nproviding low soil water storage capacity. Besides that, the low inclination of the retention \n\ncurve and the low hydraulic conductivity provided a stress-prone scenario.  \n\nThe poor performance of simulation using SHP acquired from EEdry is expected due to \n\nthe lack of representativeness of SHP for wet conditions. The SHP from the retention curve \n\nwith fitted tortuosity factor (l) when compared to l = 0.5, resulted in relative yields closer to the \n\nsimulation performed with EEwet+dry. This shows that some constraints pointed by specific \n\nsimulations in crop yield may be related to poor soil hydraulic parameterization rather than \n\nresource stress, e.g., water and energy. Yield predictions showed to be highly sensitive to soil \n\nhydraulic parameterization, even when this sensitivity does not show up strongly in predicted \n\nsoil pressure head values. \n\n \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013  Predicted relative maize yield for the Rhodic Nitossol for the wet, average and dry \n\nyear using the five different parameterizations \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013  Predicted relative maize yield for the Rhodic Ferralsol, Rhodic Lixisol, Xanthic \n\nFerrasol and Rhodic Nitossol for the average year using the five different \n\nparameterizations \n\n \n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n28-Mar 17-Apr 7-May 27-May\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n Y\n\nie\nld\n\nHigh rainfall\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n22-Mar 11-Apr 1-May 21-May\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\ne\n Y\n\nie\nld\n\nDate\n\nRC l = 0.5 RC + l fit EE wet EE dry EE wet+dry\n\nLow rainfall\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n28-Mar 22-Apr 17-May 11-Jun\n\nAverage rainfall \n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n29-Mar 18-Apr 8-May 28-May 17-Jun\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\n\ne\n Y\n\nie\nld\n\nDate\n\nRhodic Ferralsol\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n29-Mar 18-Apr 8-May 28-May 17-Jun\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\n\ne\n Y\n\nie\nld\n\nDate\n\nRhodic Lixisol\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n24-Mar-14 13-Apr-14 3-May-14 23-May-14\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\n\ne\n Y\n\nie\nld\n\nDate\n\nRC l = 0.5 RC l fit EE wet\n\nXanthic Ferrasol \n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n29-Mar 18-Apr 8-May 28-May 17-Jun\n\nR\ne\nla\n\nti\nv\n\ne\n Y\n\nie\nld\n\n \n\nDate\n\nEE dry EE wet+dry\n\nRhodic Nitossol\n\n\n\n67 \n \n\nThe use of fixed parameters or inappropriate parameterization may lead to large errors \n\nin the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function (DURNER, 1994), impacting on predictions \n\nof unsaturated water flow in the vadose zone. None of current available measuring devices \n\nallows the measurement of the SHP over the entire range of soil water content (SCHELLE et \n\nal., 2013). The prediction of SHP from retention curve data with l optimized instead of a fixed \n\nvalue, as performed in this study, may be an interesting option, however, measurement \n\ntechniques in which the natural soil structure is maintained and that provide records of soil-\n\nwater content or pressure head from saturation to complete dryness over time, coupled with \n\ninverse solution (\u0160IM?NEK; WENDROTH; VAN GENUCHTEN, 1998), are essential for the \n\nunderstanding of unsaturated soil-water flow. As a recommendation, it is suggested that, where \n\npossible, perform measurements by the different methods on the same sample, ideally \n\nsimultaneously. \n\n3.4 Conclusions \n\n1. The agro-hydrological simulations showed to be sensitive to the set of soil hydraulic \n\nparameters and to the range of pressure head for which they were determined. The \n\nexistence of several uncertainties in the procedures of soil hydraulic parameterization \n\nrestrain the extrapolation of soil hydraulic properties beyond the range of the K-?-h \n\nmeasured relation. \n\n2. Although parameterization for the wet range can represent well the realm of pressure \n\nheads experienced by the most crop systems, soil hydraulic parameterization using a \n\nwider range of pressure head is necessary to represent soil-water-plant relations in dry \n\nlands, where low soil-water content is the general rule. \n\n3. Comparing the simulation results using soil hydraulic properties from parameterization \n\nwith retention data with a fixed value l = 0.5 and with a fitted l, the latter behaved more \n\nsimilar to the methods using a measured K-?-h relation (parameterization for the wet \n\nand dry range and parameterization for the wet range). \n\n4. The different methods to obtain the soil hydraulic properties were performed with \n\ndifferent samples, some of them undisturbed and others sieved. Those factors are also \n\nembedded in the parameterizations results, and consequently, in simulations, and may \n\nhave caused some of the observed differences. \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\nReferences \n\nASSOULINE, S.; OR, D.
