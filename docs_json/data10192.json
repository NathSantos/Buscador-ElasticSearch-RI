In G1, G2 and G3, periportal thickening occurred only in schistosomal\npatients (8.5%). Mild pathological alterations in patients that cannot yet be detected by clinical examination were\ndetectable in the liver by ultrasound and can be due to fibrosis. The degree of mild periportal fibrosis was diminished in\n57.9% of patients 12 months after treatment of schistosomiasis with oxamniquine. At ultrasonography, the mean liver\nleft lobe measurement of G3 was larger than that of G1, and that of G4 larger than that of G1 and G2. The mean size of\nthe spleen of G4 was significantly larger than that of the other three groups, and that of G3 larger than that of G1 and G2.\nKey-words: Schistosomiasis mansoni. Ultrasonography.

The disease is mainly\ndue to eggs deposited in the host tissue by the adult female whose\nantigens induce granuloma formation and fibrosis, essentially in\nintestine and liver portal system. Most of the infected individuals\nliving in endemic areas are asymptomatic but a few develop\nSymmers\u2019 periportal fibrosis of the liver, that results in the severe\nform of the disease with subsequent portal hypertension,\nsplenomegaly, esophageal varices and recurrent hematemesis. The\nhepatointestinal and compensated hepatosplenic clinical forms\nrepresent early forms of the severe clinical disease found in the\nhospital (decompensated hepatosplenic)5. The sequential\ndevelopment of hepatosplenic disease was well demonstrated and\nanatomicopathologically proven15. These conclusions were\nobtained from clinical diagnosis based on liver left lobe\nenlargement, consistency, as well as spleen size detected by physical\nexamination15. However, when ultrasound was used for abdominal\nevaluation in field surveys in endemic areas for schistosomiasis, it\nbecame clear that the physical examination of the patients did not\nalways reflect the stage of the disease1. This conclusion is based\non the thickness of periportal fibrosis as determined by ultrasound\nechogenicity which correlates with liver biopsies in pathological\nstudies9. However, there is a variation on the assessment of images\nprovided by ultrasound8, especially in mild pathology, frequently\nseen in field surveys. In these cases, the interpretation of ultrasound\nimages has been discussed.\n\nIn order to identify the meaning of some findings, we\ncompared several clinical and ultrasound parameters of distinct\ngroups of schistosomiasis patients with an egg-negative group\nfrom the same endemic area. These groups were also compared\nwith hospitalized patients with the severe hepatosplenic form of\nthe disease.\n\nMATERIAL AND METHODS\n\nStudied population. This study was performed in two\nlocalities endemic for schistosomiasis (Dion\u00edsio and Melquiades)\nin the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A schistosomiasis program\naimed at studying several aspects of the disease has been active\nin these two localities since 1995. The volunteers (n = 223)\nwere submitted to parasitological, clinical and ultrasound\nexaminations. Nine patients with a clinical diagnosis of\nhepatosplenic schistosomiasis from the Santa Casa Hospital of\nBelo Horizonte city (Brazil) were also included in this study.\n\nIt is important to mention that malaria is not endemic in\nthese areas; therefore it is not a confounding disease.\nProtocols involving human subjects were approved by the\ninstitutional review and ethical committee of the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o\nOswaldo Cruz (FIOCRUZ). Treatment was offered to all\nindividuals independent of whether they consented to\nparticipate in the study.\n\nParasitological examination. Schistosoma mansoni\ninfection was evaluated by individual fecal egg examinations\ndetermined by the Kato-Katz method on stool samples\nobtained on three consecutive days11.\n\nClinical examination. Clinical examination of 223 subjects\nwas performed by two physicians. One examined patients from\nDionisio and, the other those from Melquiades. Both physicians were\nblind to the results of the feces and ultrasonographic examinations.\nHepatosplenic patients were examined by other physicians.\n\nAt abdominal examination, palpation of the right lobe of the\nliver was evaluated in the midclavicular line and the left lobe in\nthe epigastrium at inspiration; the enlargement, consistency and\nsurface were recorded. The spleen was examined below left costal\nmargin at inspiration.\n\nBased on clinical criteria, the patients were considered as\nintestinal (liver&lt;2 cm under the costal edge), hepatointestinal\n(liver palpable >2 cm under the costal edge) and hepatosplenic.\n\nPatients with schistosomiasis were treated with oral\noxamniquine, in a single dose of 15mg/kg.\n\nUltrasound. A conventional portable Hitachi EUB-200\nultrasound equipment (Tokyo, Japan) was used in the field study\nand a Sonoline Versa Plus, Siemens ultrasound with a transducer\nof 3.5 MHz for hospitalized patients. Liver size, portal-vein\ndiameter, thickness of the walls of central and peripheral portal\nbranches, spleen size and splenic vein diameters were assessed\nas described elsewhere1 9. Liver span was measured both in the\nmidclavicular line and the midline. The liver was also examined\nfor surface smoothness. Portal vein diameter was measured at\nits entrance into the liver and its bifurcation inside the liver. The\nspleen was evaluated by using oblique and longitudinal scanning\nof the left upper quadrant. The gallbladder was examined for\nwall thickness and stones. The periportal thickness was evaluated\naccording to established criteria1 4 9, with few modifications. The\ntwo physicians performing ultrasound examinations were neither\naware of the infection status nor clinical examinations of the\npatients undergoing ultrasonography. The echo enhancer contrast\n(Levovist\u00e2 ) was used as described by Albrecht et al2.\n\nOne year after treatment, some patients were again\nsubmitted to ultrasound evaluation.\n\nClassification of studied population. According to\nthe result of stool test for Schistosoma mansoni eggs and\nthe presence of periportal fibrosis, the individuals in the\nendemic areas were classified into three groups.\n\nGroup 1 - Control subjects - S. mansoni egg-negative individuals\nat stool test. Group 2 - Patients eliminating S. mansoni eggs in the\nfeces and without periportal thickening. Group 3 - Schistosoma\nmansoni egg-positive patients at stool test and periportal thickening\nat ultrasound examination. A Group 4 was added to these three\ngroups, composed of patients from Santa Casa Hospital of Belo\nHorizonte diagnosed with schistosomiasis hepatosplenic form.\n\nStatistical methods . The data were analyzed by least square\nanalysis of variance using general linear models procedures.\nTukey\u2019s test was used to determine if significant statistical differences\n(p&lt;0.05) existed between groups in relation to hepatic left lobe,\nspleen size, portal and splenic vein diameters and central and\nperipheral echogenicity, after data transformation. Since it was\nnot possible to use analysis of variance in the analysis of age and\nspleen vein diameter, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney non-\nparametric tests, were used for group comparisons. To evaluate\n\n\n\n35\n\nRevista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical 38(1):33-37, jan-fev, 2005\n\nthe relationships among several parameters the Spearman\ncorrelation coefficient was used. Variables before and after\ntreatment were examined by Student\u2019s t-test. All the analyses were\nperformed by using the SPSS software, release 8.0.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCharacterization of the study sample based on clinical\nexamination and echogenicity. Group 1-Consisted of 63\nindividuals without S. mansoni eggs in the feces and without\nthickening of the portal vein wall (periportal fibrosis). At clinical\nexamination, the liver was palpable in 7 (11.1%) 2-7 cm under\nright costal edge at midclavicular line level. Group 2 - With 141 egg-\npositive patients without periportal fibrosis. In this Group there were\n17 (12.1 %) patients with right liver lobe palpable 2-9cm under\nright costal edge. Group 3 - With 19 egg-positive patients with\nperiportal fibrosis. The periportal thickening varied from 3 to 6mm,\nthis being central in 15 and peripheral in 14. In only 5 (26.3 %)\npatients of this Group, the liver was palpable at right midclavicular\nline. Group 4 - Composed of 9 patients. From these, 4 had digestive\nhemorrhages and were hospitalized and 5 were cared for at the out-\npatient clinic. The liver was palpated in 7 (77.8%) of them and the\nspleen in 8 (88.8%). The central periportal thickening varied from\n7 to 13mm and the peripheral one from 3.5 to 5mm.\n\nWith regard to the spleen, it was not palpated in any patient\nof Groups 1, 2 or 3 and in only one of Group 4. As to the clinical\nforms, in Group 2 there were 124 intestinal and 17\nhepatointestinal, and in Group 3, respectively 14 and 5; there\nwere no patients with the hepatosplenic form nor with hard or\nnodular liver in Groups 2 and 3. In Group 4, all patients were\nhepatosplenic.\n\nIn short, comparing the palpation of liver at right\nmidclavicular line, 2cm or more under costal edge, with the\npresence of periportal fibrosis (central and/or peripheral), it\nwas verified that hepatomegaly without periportal fibrosis\noccurred in 24 individuals (G1 and G2) and hepatomegaly in\n5/19 with periportal fibrosis.\n\nThe age of the individuals varied from 8 to 77 years and the\ndistribution according to age and sex in each group is presented in\nTable 1. Group 2 has the lowest mean age, but differed statistically\nonly from Group 1. In relation to sex, the total sample is balanced\nwith 54% male and 46% female. However, a statistical difference\nwas observed in Group 3 of which 89.5% were male.\n\nUltrasound measurements of organ size, and vein\ndiameter. The mean values for longitudinal and antero-\nposterior measurements of liver left lobe and spleen as well\nas the diameters of portal and splenic veins are presented in\n\nTable 2. The statistical differences among Groups 1, 2, 3 and\n4 are shown in Figure 1. In the statistical analysis, the effect\nof sex and age were controlled by including these variables\nin the statistical model. The mean left lobe longitudinal\nmeasurement of G3 differed statistically only from Group 1\n(control) and the mean antero-posterior measurement of G4\ndiffered from G1 and G2. The mean enlargement of the spleen\nseems to be a better parameter than that of the liver to assess\nmorbidity by physical examination. This is demonstrated by\nboth measurements of the spleen, longitudinal and antero-\nposterior, of patients in G4 who differed from the other three\ngroups. In addition, the mean longitudinal measurement of\nthe spleen from G3 patients was significantly higher than those\nof G1 and G2 and lower than those of G4. The mean diameter\nof the portal vein of G3 was significantly larger than those of\nG1 and G2, but the mean diameter of G4 did not differ from\nG1 and G2. The mean diameter of the splenic vein of G4\ndiffered statistically from G2, but not from the other two\ngroups. Parametric test showed that both groups differed\nstatistically (p &lt;0.05) from each other.\n\nTable 1 - Distribution of the sample population in the groups\naccording to sex and age.\n\nGroups Male Female Mean age \u00b1 SD\n\n1 \u2013 Egg-negative 27 36 41.27\u00b116.39\n\n2 \u2013 Egg-positive without fibrosis 75 66 30.52\u00b118.24\n\n3 \u2013 Egg-positive with fibrosis 17  2 33.37\u00b117.92\n\n4 \u2013 Hepatosplenic 06  3 38.22\u00b112.47\n\nTable 2 - Measurements of liver left lobe, spleen, portal and splenic\nveins by ultrasonography.\n\nGroups    Liver (cm)              Spleen (cm)        Veins (cm)\n\nLon AP Lon AP Portal Splenic\n\n1 9.17\u00b11.56 5.91\u00b11.49 7.19\u00b11.54 6.68\u00b11.40 1.12\u00b10,14 0.76\u00b10.13\n\n2 9.38\u00b11.50 6.14\u00b11.22 7.36\u00b11.54 7.06\u00b11.28 1.09\u00b10.17 0.73\u00b10.14\n\n3 9.95\u00b11.51 6.49\u00b10.87 8.75\u00b12.23 6.83\u00b11.43 1.28\u00b10.19 0.80\u00b10.16\n\n4 10.06\u00b11.67 7.54\u00b11.69 13.68\u00b13.14 9.20\u00b11.50 1.25\u00b10.19 0.98\u00b10.29\n\nLon = longitudinal;  AP = antero-posterior\n\nDoppler ultrasonography using an echo enhancer agent\n(Levovist) showed an improvement in the visualization of the\nportal hepatic veins, but did not present any additional\ninformation.\n\nUltrasound after treatment. One year after treatment,\nas shown in Table 3, there was a significant decrease in the\nmeasurements of portal and splenic vein diameters as well\nas in central echogenicity. After treatment, portal vein\nechogenicity was reduced in 11 (57.9%) patients, remained\nunaltered in 5 (26.3%) and increased in 3 (15.8%).

Thus, the areas are of\nlow morbidity. No patient had hard nor nodular liver nor with\nprominent left lobe, which are the main clinical features for\nsuspicion of liver with periportal fibrosis. However, even\nwithout clinical suspicion, periportal thickening was\nevidenced in 19 (8.5%) of the schistosomal individuals\nexamined. It has long been known14 that Symmers\u2019 fibrosis\ncould occur without splenomegaly and without portal\nhypertension and that this was frequent in endemic areas13\n\nThe ultrasound examination not only allows confirmation of\nthe diagnosis but shows that the finding is still more frequent\nthan it was expected to be12. And also, as can be seen in this\nwork, it occurs even in some patients without clinical signs\nsuggestive of Symmers\u2019 fibrosis.\n\nUnlike that which occurred in hepatosplenic patients\n(G4), the echogenicity degree found in the endemic areas\n(G3) was slight. The mild periportal fibrosis and cellular\ninfiltration can be seen in portal spaces and although more\nfrequent in schistosomiasis3, it had been reported also in non\nschistosomiasis patients3 16. It is necessary to keep this in mind\nwhen the interpretation of the meaning of mild periportal\nt h i c k n e s s  f o u n d  i n  m a n y  p e o p l e  i n  e n d e m i c  a r e a s  i s\nconsidered. S. mansoni egg-negative individuals at stool test\n(G1), and the disappearance of this thickening in 57.9% of\nour patients after treatment (G3) suggest its connection with\nschistosomiasis.\n\nIn addition, the mean longitudinal measurement of the spleen\nof G3 patients was significantly higher than those of G1 and G2\nand smaller than those of G4. Jesus et al10 observed in\nhepatosplenic patients a correlation between the echogenicity\nof the portal tract and spleen size. Our data also showed that the\nportal and splenic vein diameters were slightly larger in G3 and\nG4 groups but these results were not statistically significant.\n\nOur studies are in agreement with previous studies by\nDoehring-Schwerdtfeger et al8, demonstrating that treatment\ninduces significant decrease in morbidity, in the group of patients\nwhere severe morbidity has not yet developed. Whether mild\nperiportal fibrosis is reinstalled when an individual is reinfected\nis still to be evaluated. It is also important to evaluate whether in\npatients with hepatosplenomegaly, the ultrasound confirms the\nsame decrease in morbidity evidenced by clinical examination6.\n\nDoppler ultrasonography using the echo enhancer agent\n(Levovist) showed an improvement in the visualization of the\nportal hepatic veins but did not add any additional relevant\ninformation.\n\nIn our study, the most precise data that allowed us to\ndetermine the stage of pathological development were from\nanalyses of central and peripheral echogenicity of the\nperiportal region and spleen size.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank Maria de F\u00e1tima da Silva, Marlucy Rodrigues\nLima, Lilian Cardoso Moreira and Ivanete dos Santos\nNascimento for field and laboratory expert technical\nassistance.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
