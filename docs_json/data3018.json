The first conclusion withdrawn was that both GDP and the variable Tax, which intended to capture the effects of the VAT increase in 2012 for these drinks, were not statistically significant, for none of the two regressions.\nThe second conclusion is that education is a significant variable for Juices &amp; Nectars, but not for Soft drinks. The opposite is true for the variable Maximum Temperature, which shows significance for Soft Drinks and not for Juices &amp; Nectars.\nIn short, we can conclude that, in the Portuguese case, an extra tax does not seem to be the most appropriate tool to fight obesity and potential alternatives may be educational programs, partnerships with producers to foster reformulation of products or to focus on other nutrients that Portuguese consume more, namely fats and salt.\n2\nSUM\u00c1RIO\nNos \u00faltimos anos tem-se evidenciado um crescente n\u00famero de indiv\u00edduos que sofrem de excesso de peso, obesidade e de doen\u00e7as relacionadas, o que impulsionou v\u00e1rios governos a implementar medidas que diminuam o consumo de certos nutrientes que em excesso s\u00e3o nocivos para a sa\u00fade.\nVisto n\u00e3o existir nenhum estudo que preveja o potencial impacto que uma taxa extra nas bebidas a\u00e7ucaradas possa ter no consumo portugu\u00eas, este estudo visa responder a essa mesma quest\u00e3o e perceber quais s\u00e3o os fatores que o influenciam.\nPara isso, foram executadas duas regress\u00f5es, uma para as Bebidas Refrescantes e outra para os Sumos &amp; N\u00e9ctares. A primeira conclus\u00e3o que se retirou foi que tanto o PIB como a vari\u00e1vel Imposto, que pretendia capturar os efeitos que o aumento do IVA em 2012 para as bebidas teve no consumo destas, n\u00e3o t\u00eam significado estat\u00edstico para nenhuma das duas regress\u00f5es.\nA segunda conclus\u00e3o \u00e9 que a vari\u00e1vel Educa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 significativa para os Sumos &amp; N\u00e9ctares, mas n\u00e3o para as Bebidas Refrescantes. O contr\u00e1rio se passa com a vari\u00e1vel Temperatura M\u00e1xima que mostra signific\u00e2ncia para as Bebidas Refrescantes mas n\u00e3o para os Sumos &amp; N\u00e9ctares.\nEm suma, podemos concluir que, no caso portugu\u00eas, um imposto extra parece n\u00e3o ser a ferramenta mais adequada no combate \u00e0 obesidade e acrescentar que potenciais alternativas poder\u00e3o ser os programas de educa\u00e7\u00e3o, parcerias com produtores para reformula\u00e7\u00f5es de produtos ou at\u00e9 o foco noutros nutrientes como sejam as gorduras e o sal.\n3\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nI would like to thank first and foremost my advisor, Professor Susana Frazao Pinheiro, for always guiding and helping me in the moments that I needed the most, keeping me motivated and focus and for her valuable feedback and time spend with this project.\nAlso a big thank you to all my colleagues at work, particularly Sophie, for always giving me the flexibility needed for developing this dissertation and their interest and support showed every day.\nFinally, a very special thank you to my parents, grand-mother and closest friends, whose encouraging and loving words, always supported and inspired me to pursue my goals.\n4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nABSTRACT..............................................................2\nSUM\u00c1RIO...............................................................3\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS......................................................4\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.....................................................5\nTABLE OF FIGURES......................................................7\nTABLE OF TABLES.......................................................8\nTABLE OF ANNEXES......................................................9\nLIST OF ACRONYMS.....................................................10\n1.\tINTRODUCTION....................................................11\n1.1.\tBackground and problem statement..............................11\n1.2.\tAims and Scope................................................11\n1.3.\tResearch Methods..............................................12\n1.4.\tRelevance.....................................................12\n1.5.\tDissertation Outline..........................................13\n2.\tLITERATURE REVIEW AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK......................14\n2.1.\tThe Obesity Epidemic: numbers and trends......................14\n2.2.\tTheoretical Frameworks: Arguments for and Against.............14\n2.3.\tPortugal: Reasons for being interested in this Tax............16\n2.4.\tSSB's Tax brought to life.....................................17\n2.4.1.\tThe countries and their policies............................17\n2.4.2.\tImpacts of the Tax on Price.................................19\n2.4.3.\tImpact of the Price on Consumption..........................21\n2.4.4.\tProduct and Brand Substitution..............................22\n2.4.5.\tImpact of Demand on Public Health...........................22\n2.4.6.\tImpact on Competitiveness...................................23\n3.\tMETHODOLOGY.....................................................24\n3.1.\tDefinition of the different categories........................24\n3.2.\tOrganization and Explanation of the Dataset...................24\n3.3.\tInteraction between the variables.............................27\n4.\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSION..........................................29\n5\n4.1.\tFocused Analysis of the Crisis Period...................................29\n4.1.1.\tAnalysis of the Importance of each Category........................29\n4.1.2.\tAnalysis of the Variation throughout the Years.....................30\n4.2.\tGeneral Analysis from 1998 to 2015......................................31\n4.2.1.\tAnalysis of the Consumption of Total Commercial Drinks from 1998-2015.31\n4.2.2.\tComparison\tof the\tGrowth\tof Soft Drinks vs Packaged Water............32\n4.2.3.\tComparison\tof the\tGrowth\tof Soft Drinks vs Juices &amp;

Nevertheless, the topic is far from consensual and its mixed results bring some doubts of its actual effectiveness.\nIn the particular case of Portugal, the doubt resides in the fact that the consumption of sugary drinks in the first place is below average and obesity levels over the average, which may indicate that these products probably are not the main contributors to the excessive caloric intake of the Portuguese population.\n1.2.\tAims and Scope\nThe main aim of this dissertation is to address the effect that a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would have in terms of consumption on the particular case of the Portuguese society. Thus, to achieve this result, two questions will be answered:\nRQ1: Have previous tax increases focused on these products changed the Portuguese consumption? And what about the GDP influence?\nRQ2: What other factors, besides the economic ones, influence the consumption and to which extent?\nThe object of study is a specific group of beverages whose content of sugar is considered high and excessive in terms of a healthy and balanced diet and can contribute to some extent to the growing rate of obesity and related illnesses.\nIn some countries, particularly the Nordic ones, this type of tax based on sugar dense products includes, besides beverages, pastries, chocolates, sweets and ice-creams in order to avoid potential substitution effects. However, in this dissertation the only focus will be on\n11\nbeverages because, as observed in other countries, the latter one is applied first as a test due to its less complex nature and much faster implementation.\n1.3.\tResearch Methods\nThe methodology applied in this study will be created having as a basis the secondary data collected in different national and internationals reputable institutions, such as UNESDA, PROBEB, APIAM, INE and IPMA, which include yearly indicators of the consumption of Soft Drinks, Juices &amp; Nectars, Packaged Water, the GDP level, Population, Temperature and Education Level, from 1998 till 2015.\nInitially, it will be developed an analysis of the three types of beverages and its subcategories, consisting of the variation of its composition throughout the years, as well as their growth levels and general trends.\nIn a posterior phase, two models will be run in R software: one explaining the factors that contribute to the consumption of Soft Drinks and the other for Juices and Nectars. The ultimate goal is to understand the importance of three main factors thought to be explicative of the vast majority of the consumption of sugary: the Economic factor, the Climate and the Education level. It will be assessed the significance of these three in the particular case of Portugal and also if all beverages are explained by exactly the same factors and if not, address the differences observed with information about the particular market of each one.\nThese models will also measure the relations between the beverages themselves in an attempt to understand if there is a certain level of substitution between them or, on the contrary, if they are complementary for the Portuguese consumer.\nWith all this information in display, the final objective is to address the potential effectiveness of a tax implemented in Portugal and for that a parallel with the VAT increase in January 2012 from 6% to 23% on these products will be drawn to comprehend the behaviour observed at that time that can occur again if a sin tax is applied.\n1.4.\tRelevance\nThis research should help national decision-makers to understand the impact a soda tax would have in Portugal and if the expected results would be comparable to those countries who have already experienced the consequences of this implementation or those whose reality inspired research analogous to this one.\n12\nThis theme is extremely recent and relevant, since during the development of this paper, the Ministry of Health alongside the Ministry of Finance and Economics announced their interest on an extra tax to be implemented on 2017, still without any concrete date or value, but certain that the income generated would be fully transferred to the National Health System, from now on referred as SNS, and to educational campaigns about healthy lifestyle, the importance of physical activity and about obesity and its related illnesses.\nAlthough these types of taxes seem to be constructed on a simple premise, which implies that those who consume more sugary drinks can more easily reach an overweight or obese state, in reality the relation is not as clear. For example, Portugal\u2019s levels of obesity is just hitting the average of the EU-28 with 15.4% and only 0.1% difference separating them, but its consumption per capita of sugary drinks is approximately 30% less that the consumption of the average European citizen. On the other side of the spectrum is the example of Germany, with 13.6% of its population obese and each German consuming 176 litres per year, compared to the Portuguese 82 litres. (UNESDA, 2015, WHO, 2015)\nConcluding, this is much more multifaceted that it seemed at first glance and it depends on many factors that decision makers cannot control or need to be aware off, such as culture, the supply side response, weather, etc., and equate solutions accordingly, so the ultimate goal is not jeopardized.\n1.5.\tDissertation Outline\nIn the Second chapter, a literature review will be presented including a theoretical framework build from the most recent studies that present the benefits, disadvantages and potential impact of the implementation of such a levy, but also an analysis in terms of price, consumption, substitution effect, competitiveness and Public Health for those countries who already took a step forward and implemented this tax.\nIn the following chapter, named Methodology, a description of the research methods, databases and statistical analysis that test the hypotheses about the impact of a soda tax in Portugal\u2019s Consumption of sugary drinks will be made.\nThen, a presentation and discussion about the most relevant study results will be developed in the fourth chapter. In the fifth and last chapter, implications of the results are debated, along with the limitations of the present study and recommendations for future research.\n13\n2.\tLITERATURE REVIEW AND CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK\n2.1.\tThe Obesity Epidemic: numbers and trends\nGlobally, obesity levels doubled since 1980, with 1.9 billion overweight adults and 600 million obese affected, representing 39% and 13% of the total adult population respectively and when it comes to children the scenario is not positive either, with the predominance of obesity for those under the age of 5 years old accounting a total of 42 million, in 2013. The situation is so alarming and evolved so quickly that even WHO admitted that it is impossible to accomplish their goal of stabilizing the numbers of those affected, until 2020. (WHO, 2015)\nOverweight and Obesity are classified by an index called Body Mass Index (BMI) that can be easily calculated by dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters (kilograms/meters2). If the value obtained is between 25 and 29.9 an individual is considered overweight, and with values greater that 30 is considered obese. (WHO, 2015)\nWhen referring to obesity, it is also crucial to refer that this illness brings a great number of other sicknesses alongside, such as heart disease, strokes, diabetes, osteoarthritis and some types of cancers, as for example, endometrial, breast and colon (WHO, 2015). Actually, many doctors defend that overeating may be the largest avoidable cause of cancer in nonsmokers (Calle and Thun, 2004).\nLastly, it is important to retain that obesity is a disease almost completely preventable and that a personal compromise on small changes in dietary habits and exercise regime, allied with the support system of the community is extremely relevant to invert this trend. (WHO, 2015)\n2.2.\tTheoretical Frameworks: Arguments for and Against\nInspired by the example of tobacco, it is believed that taxing foods that have a high concentration of sugar is the answer to reduce the obesity levels through an induced reduction of the demand, which is believed to decrease the daily caloric intake. This is justified with the classic microeconomics theories (Marshall, 1890), that proved that there is a negative relation between the price of a product and its demand, known as demand-elasticity. (Caraher and\n14\nCowburn 2005; Finkelstein et al. 2004; Jacobson and Brownell 2000; Kim and Kawachi 2006; Kuchler, Tegene, and Harris 2005; Leicester and Windmeijer 2004)\nThere are five types of demand-elasticity: elastic, perfectly elastic, inelastic, perfectly inelastic and unit-elastic. In the first case, an increase of price of 1% leads to a decrease in consumption of more than 1%, ceteris paribus, which means that the response of the consumer is much more significant and that it is most probably a non- essential good. An extreme case of this type is the perfectly elastic demand where the smallest change imaginable in price will lead to a major change in the consumption, because that product is completely superfluous (Marshall, 1890).\nAn essential product most of the times entails an inelastic demand, where an increase of 1% in price leads to a decrease in consumption of less than 1%, ceteris paribus, because consumers still have to satisfy their need for that product, so they try to reduce their purchase, but only a small decrease is possible. When there is absolutely no possibility of decreasing or shifting consumption there is a case of perfectly inelastic, where the buyers are insensitive to a price change. (Marshall, 1890)\nThere is also the unit-case one, where an increase of price of 1% leads to a decrease in consumption of exactly 1%, ceteris paribus, which is a rare case since the values tend to be below or above and not exactly. (Marshall, 1890)\nA common concern about taxing food is that it can be inelastic and have a very small contribution to the reduction of consumption, because these products are a basic need, without which survival is threatened. Yet, the food category and its inelasticity can be further divided into the most needed goods, such as cereals and meat, and those who are not absolutely essential and that need to be consumed in moderation, such as excessively sweet and salty foods that must be considered occasional treats, so its demand is still inelastic but with value much closer to -1. (Andreyeva, Long and Brownell, 2010)\nWhen it comes to sugar-sweetened beverages, studies have shown that the demandelasticity level is approximately between -0.8 and -1, or that an increase in 1% in price will lead to a reduction between 0.8% and 1% in demand, which indicates that this tax can be an important toll in the battle against obesity. (Andreyeva, Long and Brownell, 2010)\nOther advantage is the financial reinforcement (Jacobson and Brownell, 2000) that can be injected in the respective national health system to alleviate a possible negative balance or the increased costs of obesity related illnesses, as well as improving the allocation of public goods, as for example, the water supply in more isolated and poor regions, as it happen in Mexico (Colchero et al., 2016).\n15\nSome unanswered questions arise from the fact that this indirect taxation has a recessive nature that harms lower income households, since the tax amount is the same for everybody, regardless of their economic status, making it more burdensome, in terms of percentage of income, to poorer families (Nnoaham et al., 2009). The counter argument is that sugary drinks are not a basic necessity and are nutritionally poor, not contributing to a healthy and varied diet. Moreover, obesity is more prevalent in low income families what would make this amplified decrease in consumption that much more positive in terms of health and wellbeing. (Kotakorpi et al., 2011)\nLastly, in order to overcome potential problems and to maximize the positive effects on a health perspective, it is crucial that a significant level of tax is implemented in order to affect those who have higher consumption levels and that need it the most (Powell and Chaloupka, 2009).\n2.3.\tPortugal: Reasons for being interested in this Tax\nThere are both practical and substantive reasons that can appeal the Portuguese decision makers to introduce a tax on sugary drinks.\nFirstly, it is much easier to implement a soda tax than any other sin taxes, because the identification of products with these characteristics: beverages that contain levels of sugar above a certain limit considered normal, is less complex unlike, for example, a tax on product with high concentration of salt where it would be needed to check virtually every product, since there are those which are perceived as not salty or even healthy, that contain high levels of salt. (American Heart Association, 2015)\nSpecifically for Portugal, Government could be attracted to implement this sugary tax as the prevalence of excess weight and obesity have increased throughout the years and it affects now 50% of the population (DGS, 2015) and also due to the fact that high BMI levels were responsible for 13% of the total of potential years of life lost. (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2013)\nThe reality is even more alarming when it comes to childhood obesity, with one in three Portuguese children, between the ages of 2 and 12, being overweight and obese (Rito et al., 2012). Not to mention also that these obese children, compared to normal weight ones, are twice as likely to be obese adults (Serdula et al., 1993) and that, when parenthood arrives, if one of them suffers from obesity, their off springs will have 40% more chances of growing up\n16\nobese, creating a vicious genetic and environmental cycle that is hard to break. (Lifshitz, 2008)\nFurthermore, the National Health Expenses in percentage of the GDP, from 2000 to 2015, had a general growing trend, even though a decrease was observed from 2010 to 2015 due to the demands of the financial rescue plan (ACSS, 2014), which shows Portugal\u2019s difficult financial situation that could be improved, if part of the revenues would be channelled for the national health system, for educational preventive purposes and/or to subsidize healthy products. (Jacobson and Brownell, 2000)\n2.4.SSB\u2019s Tax brought to life\nAfter reviewing the theories developed around this subject, it is crucial to observe what countries from all over the world have experienced after implementing measures that aim to reduce the consumption of certain groups of products and minimize the negative externalities in terms of health.\nTo better understand this phenomenon this chapter will analyse the tax design, as well as its influence on price, consumption, substitution effects, public health and competitiveness of the sector.\nDue to the lack of exhaustive research about these six effects in all the countries listed above, the analysis on these parts will be focused on four countries: Denmark, Finland, France and Hungary, whose cases are very well studied. Despite this, in the following sub-chapter\n2.4.1,\tcharacteristics of the tax in other countries less well studied will be presented, in order to show the variety of forms that these levies can assume.\n2.4.1.\tThe countries and their policies\nWhen analysing Table 1, the first aspect that stands out is that this measure is not new for Denmark and Finland, that started developing and implementing in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, with the particularity of the abolishment in 2014 in Denmark.\nThis abolishment appears after the implementation of a recent tax applied to saturated fat that increased even more the level of dissatisfaction of the Danish citizens, since it seems to be linked with job losses, loss of competitiveness, cross border shopping, illegal sales and incapability of transferring the revenues into the health and educational system. All of these\n17\nlead to a fall of both sugary drinks and fat tax as a pro-economic growth and employment measure. (Vallgarda, Holm and Jensen, 2015, Gade and Klarskov, 2012, Snowdon, 2013)\nSecondly, there is no homogeneity in terms of formula or values of sugar that can be considered high, with some countries going as low as 0.5g per 100ml, others starting at 5g and in some cases even at 8g. Additionally there are also those who created particular levy bands, such as the UK and Denmark. Some have even created a different levy according to the type of sweetener used, dividing between sugar-sweetened and sweetener-based beverage.\nThirdly, some doubts are raised when it comes to two specific products: 0 kcal soft drinks and 100% fruit juices, since the first do not have calories but are still considered a soft drink, while the second still has a high content of sugar but it comes purely from fruit. Countries such as France and Mexico have decided to include 0kcal and light drinks despite its absence or extremely reduced nutritional value, due to the fact that it can lead to other medical problems, such as dental erosion, due to the presence of citric, phosphoric and tartaric acids (Nadimi et al., 2013).\nThe inclusion of fruit juices is also not unanimous, as this good still has the minerals, vitamins and anti-oxidants of fruits but, thanks to the squeezing process, has lost most of the natural fibre, that slowly breaks down the sugars during digestion and avoids that this big quantity of sugar ingested in a very short amount of time leaves the liver unable to metabolize, forcing its storage in the form of fat. (Crowe and Murray, 2013)\nLastly, a mention of the fact that the UK has decided to give a two year period after approving the law, so the companies present on its market have the opportunity to innovate, substitute and/or decrease the content of sugar, in order to reduce the potential hazards that it can have on competitiveness and employment.(The Telegraph, 2016)\nTable 1: Design of some of the existing Tax on SSB worldwide\nCountry\tIntroduction\tProducts\tTax Rate/Amount\nDenmark (Ecorys, 2014)\tSince 1930's.

Impacts of the Tax on Price\nOne of the most determinant factors for the success of this policy is the amount of the tax that retailers and manufacturers absorb themselves and consequently do not pass to the consumer. In the case of under-shifting, which means that the producers did not passed the total amount of tax and that prices did not increased as much as intended, a less significant decrease in consumption will be observed and it can jeopardize the health benefits expected.\nThe ideal scenario would be to have an over-shift, which means that the actual price increase is much greater than the expected, which can indicate that retailers and/or manufacturers seize this opportunity to increase prices.\nDenmark: Tax of Soft Drinks and Juices (Ecorys, 2014)\nWhen it comes to the analysis of under or over-shifting in Denmark, the result is inconclusive for the overall effect, the only product where there is a strong indication that the margins for both manufacturers and retailers increased are colas.\n19\nFinland: Tax of Soft Drinks and Juices (Ecorys, 2014)\nAs it is possible to see the prices rose severely more than expected and the margins for retailers and Manufacturers also rose.\nTable 2: Expected vs Actual Price Changes after the implementation of the SSB tax in Finland\n\t2011\t2012\t2013\nExpected Price\t1.5%\t0%\t0.9%\nChange\t\t\t\nActual Price Change\t7.3%\t7.3%\t2.7%\nSource: Ecorys, 2014\nFrance: Tax on Sugared and Non-sugar-sweetened Soft Drinks (Ecorys, 2014)\nAn interesting aspect of this experience in France is that manufacturers and retailers were unable to fully pass the total amount of tax right in 2012, so, as a consequence, the total amount of the actual price change is the sum of the effect on the first and subsequent years, which means that for the regular cola the total is 8.1%, low calorie cola 10.6% and juices 9.2%.\nThe first conclusion that can be drawn is that there was an over-shifting in all categories.\nThe second conclusion that this study presented was that the sector's margins were maintained, but if analysed in particular terms there is a decrease in regular cola, while in low calorie there is an increase in margin, which results in a Strategic Pricing Strategy.\nTable 3: Expected vs Actual Price Changes after the implementation of the SSB tax in France\n\tRegular Cola\tLow Calorie Cola\tJuices (1%-99%)\nExpected Price Change\t2012: 4.5%\t2012: 4.7%\t2012: 6.2%\nActual Price Change\t2012: 5%; 2013: 3.1% Total: 8.1%\t2012: 6%; 2013: 4.6% Total: 10.6%\t2012: 5.3%; 2013: 3.9% Total: 9.2%\nSource: Ecorys, 2014\nHungary: Tax on Sugared andNon-sugar-sweetened Soft Drinks (Ecorys, 2014)\nAs it can be verified the total expected price change for the colas (3.1%) was slightly below than the total actual price change (5.3%) which indicates an over-shift. Moreover there was also a strategic price strategy taking place, with the increase of margins for the two types of cola. When it comes to juices, the link is not straight-forward because the total actual price\n20\nchange was lower than the expected, which may mislead to an idea of under-shifting, which is only partly true. In actuality, what happen was that retailers maintain the margin in the taxed juices but when it came to non-taxed juices (>25%) they raised significantly their margins and prices.\nAnother interesting aspect that occurred in Hungary was the fast response when it came to product reformulation in response to the tax implementation, since 70% of the manufacturers reduced the amount of the targeted ingredient.\nTable 4: Expected vs Actual Price Changes after the implementation of the SSB tax in Hungary\n\tRegular and Low-Cal.

Impact of the Price on Consumption\nDenmark: Tax of Soft Drinks and Juices (Ecorys, 2014)\nA high volatility of demand was observed over time that does not seem to be related to the tax change.\nFinland: Tax of Soft Drinks (Ecorys, 2014)\nIn Finland there was already a negative trend before the implementation of the soda tax but the pace of this decrease was accelerated and in one year the consumption fell 3.8%. In terms of juices, the decrease was even more severe with values ranging from -15% to -35%.\nFrance: Tax on Sugared and Non-sugar-sweetened Soft Drinks (Ecorys, 2014)\nIn this country there was an inversion of a growing trend and an accumulated decrease in consumption in 2012-2013 of around 6.7% for regular cola and 6.1% for low calorie cola, representing a decrease of 3 to 3.5 litres per person per year. The decrease was far less expressive in the juices category, with an effect of -2% which is close to the negative trend already observed in previous years.\n21\nHungary: Tax on Sugared andNon-sugar-sweetened Soft Drinks (Ecorys, 2014)\nAs it occurs in Finland, there was already a negative trend taking place, but still having this fact in consideration the decrease was bigger than expected which can be attributed to the tax. For the period of 2007-2011 it was observed a decrease of 13.51% and in 2011-2013 -15.1% and in juices -2.7% and -22.92%. The industry as a whole, decreased 14% in the late period studied.\n2.4.4.\tProduct and Brand Substitution\nConcerning Product substitution, it is very difficult to draw any conclusion in the cases of Denmark and Finland that show trends that seem to be largely attributed to the preexisting trend before alterations in the taxation methods than actually any reactive change. One example that can perfectly illustrate this is low calorie sodas whose growth has changed by only the previous trend effect and not any further increase as a result of the added tax, which would penalize the almost perfect substitute regular cola. (Ecorys, 2014)\nIn France and Hungary, the picture is clearer when it comes to product substitution, with the consumption of 100% juices increasing after the application of a tax to all soft drinks in France (Bonnet and Requillart, 2013) and a rise for sugar-free, low-calorie and mineral water for the Hungarian market. (PWC, 2013)\nIn terms of substitution effects towards other food categories such as sweets and salty snacks there is no robust link that can assure a connection between the two. (Finkelstein et al., 2013)\n2.4.5.\tImpact of Demand on Public Health\nDue to its novelty, it is very hard to determine the real effects of such a measure. There is really no long-term data about diet characteristics, obesity levels and related illnesses that can lead to conclusive outcomes about the relation between this measure and a positive impact on the reduction of obesity. (Ecorys, 2014)\n22\n2.4.6.\tImpact on Competitiveness\nAs expected, these taxation policies brought an added administrative burden to companies, particularly dependent of the national tax design. (Ecorys, 2014)\nConcerning the profitability, it is very difficult to affirm the real effects of such a measure since most companies interviewed produced both taxed and non-taxed products which meant that in terms of the taxed ones there was a slight decreased in profitability that was more than compensated by the increased profitability of the non-taxed alternatives and lead to redirection of investment towards these non-taxed drinks. (Ecorys, 2014)\nThe same trend is observed in terms of employment, showing that the decrease in demand of labour in taxed goods in the value chain is transferred to the non-taxed since the majority is produced in the same factories and distributed by the same companies. (Ecorys, 2014)\n23\n3.\tMETHODOLOGY\n3.1.\tDefinition of the different categories\nAs it is possible to see in the diagram below there are three categories in the Market of Beverages, but the focus of this study will be the commercial drinks section, which is divided in: Bottled water; Juices &amp; Nectars and Soft drinks.\nMost of these concepts are easily grasped, such as bottled mineral water, Milk Products, Coffee and Tea, but some can raise several doubts due to its similarities, particularly concerning the Juices &amp; Nectars and Soft Drinks. That is the reason why Annex 1 is, a summary and explanation derived from the Portuguese and Europeam Law, ilustrated with some examples, was created, as well as Figure 1 where it is possible to understand how the categories are divided.\nFigure 1: Division by Types of Beverages, according to the European and Portuguese Law.\n3.2. Organization and Explanation of the Dataset\nIn the particular case of beverages, some possible factors that may influence its purchase are the Gross National Product (Stuckler et al., 2012), Weather (Murray et al., 2010) and Psychological factors. (Elfhag et al., 2008, Glanz et al., 1998)\nSo for this study, 8 variables were tested and organized in 4 groups.\n24\nThe first one is the \u201cConsumption group\u201d which includes 3 variables: the annual consumption per capita of Juices &amp; Nectars (JN), Packaged Water (PW) and Soft Drinks (SD).\nIt is crucial to refer that all of these consumption categories include only the amount of litres consumed in the Portuguese territory, sold in all the outlets, from the on-trade ones (bars, restaurants, etc.) to off-trade (supermarkets, hypermarkets, independent retailers and others), and does not include, for example, the part of national production exported.\nConcerning the categories itself, Juices &amp; Nectars maintain its definition used until now and better explained in Annex 1, as well as Packaged Water, where only the bottled Natural Mineral Water (non-carbonated) is considered. However it is crucial to highlight the small difference between the definitions of Soft Drinks used until now and on these mathematical studies, since the last one does not include the dilutables. This does not constitute a problem, knowing that this product contribution to the total non-alcoholic beverages is about 1% and its growth is stagnated for the last 6 years, in Portugal, which will be analysed in depth in the next chapter.\nThe data concerning these three variables was all developed by Canadean, an international researcher for soft drinks and alcoholic beverages, who has a vast number of studies that are then purchased by institutions such as UNESDA (Union of European Beverage Association), PROBEB (Portuguese Association of Non-Alcoholic Beverages) and APIAM (Portuguese Association of the Industrials of Mineral Water), that at no charge release part of these data in order to inform the general public about the market of Soft Drinks, Juices, Nectars and Water.\nThe second group of this study is associated to the Social-Demographic aspect and it comprises two variables: Population (Pop), which is understandably the residents in the national territory, in millions; and Education Level (Educ), that in this case is the number of individuals with higher education (minimum of a bachelor degree), in thousands. The addition of the Education variable is an attempt to capture part of the psychological factors, mostly health and environmental related.\nThirdly, there is a smaller group, whose objective is to address the correlation between the atmospheric conditions and the consumption of sugary beverages. Initially, the variable chosen was the Average Temperature (AverTemp), which is the average of the monthly average temperature registered in the Portuguese territory. However, the disadvantage known to the average concept had in this case a preponderant role. For example, there could be that 2 years with the exact same average temperature, but very different variations between the\n25\nwinter temperatures and the summer ones which would signify that the demand in the one with more variation is higher.\nTherefore, an alternative variable, whose computation is the average of the maximum temperatures observed monthly in Portugal, was implemented to try to mitigate the above explained disadvantage, even though several simulations to test both were done in order to understand its effect and the most suited one. Lastly, the source of these two variables was IPMA (Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere), a reputable national entity that investigates, publishes and informs about meteorological, geological and maritime occurrences.\nThe final and most relevant group for this study is the Economic one, composed by two variables: the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which shows the output created in a particular economy in a certain period, in this case a year, and other variable called Tax. This last one is associated to the increased VAT level on SD and JN implemented on January 1st 2012 and that meant that these products were transferred from the lowest VAT category of 6% to the highest one of 23%. The aim here was to assess if there was a shift of any source in the consumption that can be attributed to this measure, and that can illustrate in a realistic manner how a sin tax penalizing sugary drinks can work out for Portugal.\nIn the GDP case, the logic was that, as it represents the wealth of a country and its citizens, then a decrease as the one registered during the crisis is synonym of a decrease in income that may incite a decrease in the demand of such products.\nThe source from where the data concerning the GDP was extracted was INE (National Institute of Statistics) and for the Tax, a variable was created on R that can capture some possible effect during and after 2012.\nAll of the above variables are yearly with the first observation in 1998 and the last in 2015, bringing to a total of 18 periods. It is crucial to denote that data before 1998 was excluded from this study due to the fact that before this year the sub-category \u201cIced Tea/Coffee\u201d, the second most important category in the Portuguese Soft Drinks' market, was not included in the overall Soft Drinks' value of consumption and it was impossible to find values for that isolated parcel.\nFinally, the three variables linked to the consumption as well as the GDP were transformed into per capita values, simply achieved by dividing by the population of that particular year, in order to avoid the effect of the variating population in the total consumption/GDP.\n26\n3.3.Interaction between the variables\nIn order to answer the two research questions proposed earlier, analysis of the data will be done to explore the nature, composition and variation of the beverage market on a more insightful manner.\nTo achieve that, the analysis will start on a more narrow perspective of the consumption derived from a close up to the Crisis Period (2010-2014) that is part of Portugal\u2019s reality for the last years and which is extremely relevant to grasp the intrinsic characteristics of the market and its consumer behaviour, in a down period.\nThis section includes the observation and computation of the weight of each subdivision, both on a category level, as well as on the macro level of NACD. Additionally, it will be studied the variation, year by year, for all, as well as the variation 2014/2010 and the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).\nDue to the fact that detailed data about the sub-categories of both Juices &amp; Nectars and Soft Drinks were not available before 2010 and for the year of 2015, there is then a broadening of the spectrum of the analysis for the data frame of 1998-2015, that only focus on the three main groups: SD, JN and PW.\nThis sub-chapter can be divided into two segments: an initial one, where it is analysed the trends, annual growth rate and CAGR for the beverages after the data frame is divided in three distinct phases of consumption; and a second segment where it will be observed graphically the interactions between the consumption variables between each other to try to see if there is any relation between them and if yes, if there is any sign of complementarity or substitution to one another. Similarly, a comparison between the growth rates of GDP and each of the beverages will be done to understand if they are in any way related.\nFollowing this initial graphic analysis, there is the exploration of the interaction between the several factors for the Soft Drinks and Juices and Nectars through the interpretation of the results of the regressions ran.\nFor this last part it the program R was used to run two multiple linear regressions through the method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) (Rencher and Christensen, 2012), in order to understand the behaviour of the consumer when it comes to SD and JN and the causeeffect relation between the several variables.\nThe respective initial regressions are as follows:\n\u2022 SDpc = fto + Pi* Year + P2* JNpc +\t* PWpc + 04* Pop + ft5*\nMaxTemp + fi6* Educ +\t* GDPpc +\t* Tax + e\n27\n\u2022 JNpc = Po + P1* ^ear + P2* SDpc +\t* PWpc + 04* Pop + P5*\nMaxTemp + fi6* Educ +\t* GDPpc +\t* Tax + e\nFrom this point on several alternative models will be tested to see which of the variables are significant and contribute more to the understanding of the dependant variable, as well as the overall quality of the model. After finding those explanatory variables, the coefficients will be interpreted and the values will be explain by theoretical research about the general trends of the market, consumer behaviour, strategies of the companies who operate in the Portuguese market, among others.\n28\n4.\tRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n4.1.Focused Analysis of the Crisis Period\n4.1.1.\tAnalysis of the Importance of each Category\nExamining the database of Canadean, it is possible to observe that the Non-Alcoholic Commercial Drinks represent around 60% of the total consumption of beverages, even though it suffered a decrease of 3%. In second place, there is milk with around 30% and hot drinks with 10%, both increasing their importance overtime.\nIn the first category, the bottled water represents more than half of the consumption of NACD and has verified a decrease of 1.8%, in the period 2010-2014. In second place there is the SD with approximately 22% of the total Beverages and a change of -1.3%, explained by the decrease of the three major subgroups: Carbonated; Iced Tea/ Coffee and Still drinks, being the others unable to counterbalance these losses, due to its minor contribution to the overall total of refreshing drinks.\nInterestingly, the subcategory of carbonated stabilized its importance in terms of total beverages, but in terms of the soft drinks it gained 2%. The same cannot be said about the still drinks that decrease almost 1% overall and its importance inside the sub-category decreased 3%.\nConcerning the Milk Category, the white milk represent the vast majority and increased 1.5% over time, while the Other milk, such as soy, almond, coconut, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, and yogurts sustained their position with a marginal change of 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively.\nLastly, the hot drinks most important category is hot coffee that varied almost 1% and tea with an insignificant 0.1% increase.\n29\nTable 5: Weight of each Category in terms of Overall Consumption of all Beverages\n\t2010\t2011\t2012\t2013\t2014\nNon-Alcoholic Commercial Drinks\t62,0%\t61,1%\t58,8%\t58,2%\t58,9%\nBottled Mineral Water\t36,3%\t36,3%\t34,9%\t33,9%\t34,5%\nJuices &amp; Nectars\t2,9%\t2,8%\t2,9%\t3,0%\t3,0%\nJuices\t0,7%\t0,6%\t0,6%\t0,6%\t0,6%\nNectars\t2,3%\t2,1%\t2,2%\t2,4%\t2,5%\nSoft Drinks\t22,8%\t22,0%\t21,0%\t21,3%\t21,4%\nCarbonated Drinks\t11,2%\t10,7%\t10,4%\t10,7%\t11,0%\nIced Tea and Coffee\t6,5%\t6,8%\t6,4%\t6,2%\t6,1%\nStill Drinks\t3,7%\t3,3%\t2,8%\t2,9%\t2,9%\nSquash and syrups\t0,5%\t0,6%\t0,6%\t0,7%\t0,7%\nFruit Powders\t0,6%\t0,6%\t0,6%\t0,6%\t0,6%\nEnergy Drinks\t0,1%\t0,1%\t0,1%\t0,1%\t0,1%\nSports Drinks\t0,1%\t0,1%\t0,1%\t0,0%\t0,0%\nMilk Products\t29,1%\t29,7%\t31,6%\t32,0%\t31,1%\nWhite Milk\t23,2%\t23,6%\t25,2%\t25,6%\t24,7%\nOther Milk\t2,6%\t2,7%\t2,9%\t2,9%\t2,9%\nDrinkable Yogurts\t3,3%\t3,3%\t3,5%\t3,5%\t3,5%\nHot Beverages\t8,9%\t9,2%\t9,6%\t9,7%\t10,0%\nCoffee\t8,2%\t8,4%\t8,7%\t8,8%\t9,1%\nTea\t0,8%\t0,8%\t0,9%\t0,9%\t0,9%\nSource: Canadean, 2014\n4.1.2.\tAnalysis of the Variation throughout the Years\nHaving has a base the database of Canadean about the consumption in millions of litres from 2010 to 2014 of this categories and subgroups, it is possible to affirm that all of the three main categories, NACD, Milk and Hot drinks decreased in terms of consumption in the time framed analysed. Being the biggest fall observed in NACD with -17.4% followed by the milk products with a decrease of -7.3% and Hot Beverages with a smaller decrease of -2.7%.\nAnalysing in more detail the NACD subgroups, it is possible to observe that the mineral water variation between 2010 and 2014 was -17.5%. When it comes to Fruit juices and nectars the overall trend was -10.2% being the fruit juices the most affected with -27.9%.\nThe soft drinks took a toll of -18.3%, with the extreme cases of sports drinks reducing to half and the non-carbonated/still beverages -33.1%, while the carbonated ones only decreased -15%. A type of drink that has an inverted trend are the squash and syrups that had an increase of 12.9%.\n30\nTable 6: Annual and Total Variation by Category\n\tA11/10\tA12/11\tA13/12\tA14/13\tA14/10\nNon-Alcoholic Commercial Drinks\t-4,4%\t-11,0%\t-3,6%\t0,6%\t-17,4%\nBottled Mineral Water\t-2,9%\t-11,0%\t-5,3%\t1,0%\t17,5%\nJuices &amp; Nectars\t-9,2%\t-3,6%\t2,4%\t0,3%\t10,2%\nJuices\t-10,8%\t-5,0%\t-11,8%\t-3,5%\t-27,9%\nNectars\t-8,7%\t-3,2%\t6,5%\t1,2%\t-4,8%\nSoft Drinks\t-6,1%\t-11,8%\t-1,4%\t0,1%\t18,3%\nCarbonated Drinks\t-7,9%\t-9,7%\t0,4%\t1,8%\t-15,0%\nIced Tea and Coffee\t1,1%\t-12,9%\t-6,0%\t-1,8%\t-18,7%\nStill Drinks\t-15,2%\t-20,4%\t2,0%\t-2,8%\t-33,1%\nSquash and syrups\t4,8%\t3,2%\t2,2%\t2,2%\t12,9%\nFruit Powders\t-1,3%\t-2,7%\t-1,8%\t-1,4%\t-7,1%\nEnergy Drinks\t4,4%\t-4,3%\t-4,4%\t2,3%\t-2,2%\nSports Drinks\t-17,6%\t-25,0%\t-19,0%\t0,0%\t-50,0%\nMilk Products\t-1,2%\t-1,4%\t-1,3%\t-3,6%\t-7,3%\nHot Beverages\t0,1%\t-3,9%\t-1,1%\t2,2%\t-2,7%\nTotal Beverages\t-3,1%\t-7,5%\t-2,6%\t-0,6%\t-13,2%\nSource: Canadean, 2014\n4.2. General Analysis from 1998 to 2015\n4.2.1.\tAnalysis of the Consumption of Total Commercial Drinks from 1998-2015\nThrough the observation of the Canadean data, it is possible to denote the existence of three different consumption cycles: the first starting in 1998 and reaching the peak in 2004; the second from 2005 to 2010, where it is visible a decrease after 2004 and recuperating by the end; finally from 2011 to 2015, with a fall after 2010 and the beginning of a recuperation by 2015.\nStarting the analysis from 1998 to 2004, there was a period of great expansion for all three categories and particularly for Soft Drinks with 30.59% increase, followed by Packaged Water with 26.02% and Juices &amp; Nectars 23.84%, which represent a CAGR of 4.55%, 3.93% and 3.63% per year, respectively.\n31\nConcerning the period of 2005-2010, the growth has been a lot more modest for soft drinks and Juices &amp; Nectars with less than 9% variation, while the Packaged Water thrived with 48.02% growth.\nOn the last section, from 2011-2015, both soft drinks and water took a tool due to the financial crisis, registering a decrease of -12.64% and -7.75%, respectively. The category of Juices &amp; Nectars had a surprising variation of 14.68%, which was higher than on the last period.\nAlso it is relevant to note that Soft Drinks and Juices &amp; Nectars, in 2015 registered a small recovery, even though the packaged water continued to fall.\nTable 7: Variation and CAGR for the 3 categories of the Commercial Drinks\n\tSoft Drinks\tPackaged Water\tJuices &amp; Nectars\nA04/98\t30,59%\t26,02%\t23,84%\nCAGR\t4,55%\t3,93%\t3,63%\n\t\t\t\nA10/05\t6,52%\t48,02%\t8,35%\nCAGR\t1,27%\t8,16%\t1,62%\nA15/11\t-12,64%\t-7,75%\t14,68%\nCAGR\t-3,32%\t-2,00%\t3,48%\nSource: Canadean, 2014\n4.2.2. Comparison of the Growth of Soft Drinks vs Packaged Water\nRight at the beginning, from 1999 to 2001 the yearly growth rates increase and observe a very similar movement for both, with the only difference that SD grow at a higher rate that packaged water. Also, in terms of quantities, PW is slightly below in litres per person and only surpasses the SD consumption later in 2005.\nAfterwards, the movement between the two do not seem as synchronized as before, with the soft drinks being affected by a slower and slower rate of growth until 2005, the first year were a negative value of growth was observed, and continued until 2007. The movement of packaged water was always made on the positive side with growth rates between 7% and 9% in 2003, 2005 and 2006 and 1% and 2% on the remaining years.\nFrom 2006 onwards, till 2013, the trend is again parallel peaking in 2008 with the greatest value of the growth (20%) reached by the packaged water, which was always superior to SD. The descend started from there and in 2011 the values passed to negative growth rates\n32\nwith the absolute minimum in 2012, where SD consumption declined 12%. In 2013, PW recover and grew 8%, despite the fact that SD also recovered but still had a decrease of 1%.\nIn the last two years of this study, the trends were opposite to each other with the PW going from an 8% growth as referred before to 1% and then a rate of -10% in 2015, whereas the SD category maintain the decrease of 1% in2014 but grew 1% in the final year.\nTo conclude, it seem that SD and Packaged water are positively correlated since its movement for most of the years observed was parallel, with the very few exceptions of the period from 2003 to 2005 and 2014 and 2015. Nonetheless, only the OLS regression will confirm this on a more accurate level and also point a specific value for this relation.\nFigure 3: Annual Variation ofSoft Drinks and Packaged Water, 1998-2015\n4.2.3.\tComparison of the Growth of Soft Drinks vs Juices &amp; Nectars\n33\nTo start, from 1998 to 2001, it seems that the SD\u2019s trend is one year behind the JN\u2019s one, as it is possible to see that the latter one had its stagnant period in 1999-2000 and SD followed the lead in 2000-2001 and while the JN were already decreasing their growth rate in 2001, the SD followed only in 2002.\nBoth continued to descend their rate till 2005 with the exception of 2004 where both beverages increased 2%. Interestingly, the JN registered their lowest point 2005 with a contraction of 7% in its consumption and from that point on its situation improved, however the same was not observer for the SD that had two low points one in the same year as the JN but the other was two years after in 2007 and only after that increased.\nThe two drinks met again in 2008, a year of significant growth of 6% for the JN and 10% for SD and for the subsequent years the rate decreased its growth intensity and reached negative variation in 2011 with JN losing 9% and SD 6%. This year was also the bottom value for JN who continue to lose -3% in 2012, but on the next year increased 3%. The lowest value for the SD was observed a year after the JN\u2019s one and represented a loss of 12%, the lowest variation rate in the whole period.\nIn the before the last year of the analysed data frame both of the beverages met at the rate of -1% and then both increased but at completely different paces of 1% for Soft Drinks and 16% for Juices &amp; Nectars.\nTo sum up, it seems that the relation between both of these variable are positive, which means that when one increases the other also registers the same trend and are both in\nFigure 4: Annual Variation of Soft Drinks and .Juices &amp; Nectars, 1998-2015\n34\n4.2.4.\tComparison of the Growth of Juices &amp; Nectars vs Packaged Water\nComparing now the JN evolution with the packaged water is possible to observe right in the first 5 years that the relation between the two seems to be lagged in one year, just like it happen with the soft drinks.\nFrom 2003 till 2007, the effects are opposite to each other since the rate of growth of the packaged water is positive whereas the juices and nectars have a decrease in consumption in that period. The numbers are so scattered that, for example in 2005 the JN decrease 7% while the PW increased 9%.\nIt is only in 2008 that they share again the same evolution, although there is still a significant gap of 14% in growth. Until 2011, the trend is very similar with both going through a downturn reaching the bottom in 2011 for JN and in 2012.\nThe positive evolution only appeared in 2013 with a 3% increase for the JN and 8% for the packaged water, from than moment on the trend went complete opposite ways with the increase of 16% for Juices and Nectars in2015 versus the decrease of 10% in the same year.\nIn this particular case is very difficult to establish if the relation between the two beverages is positive, negative or non-existent since there are several segments in the time frame that they are opposite to each other and others where they are both following the same trend, consequently there can only be more certainty when the regression is executed later.\nFigure 5: Annual Variation ofJuices &amp; Nectars and Packaged Water, 1998-2015\n35\n4.2.5.\tComparison of the Growth of GDP vs Juices &amp; Nectars and Soft Drinks\nIn order to try to understand the possible relation between these two sugary beverages and the Gross Domestic Product created in the Portuguese Economy, a first graphic analysis will be now done and right away, it is observed that there is a certain degree of inconsistency.\nIn the first few years, more precisely from 1998 to 2004, there is a certain cohesion in terms growth since the economy is rising from 1% to 7% and the consumption of beverages seem to follow the trend with some years such as 1999 and 2000 where the same rate is roughly observed and after there is the JN which growth at a slower rate than the GDP and the SD at a slightly higher and from 2002 to 2004 they return to have very close movement.\nAfter this, there is a period of inconsistency with some periods where there is an expansion in the national economy of approximately 4% to 5% and still the consumption reached some of the lowest points with -7% and -5% in 2005 and -3% and -1% in 2006 for Juices &amp; Nectars and Soft Drinks, respectively. It is also possible to see that, for example, in 2015 the growth in the economy was also 4% and the values were very unalike with JN increasing 16% and SD 1%.\nIn 2008 and 2009, both SD and JN increased more than the GDP and in 2010 the same value was observed for the three indicators.\nThe pick of the Portuguese financial crisis was observed in 2011 and 2012 and that possibly lead to the two drinks decreasing more than the latter. In the last few years of this framework, the GDP and the Soft Drinks seem to be more in sync while the Juices and Nectars behaviour is not as stable.\n^^\"Soft Drinks ^^\"Juices &amp; Nectars ^^\"GDPpc\n1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015\nFigure 6: Annual Variation for GDP, Juices &amp; Nectars and Soft Drinks, 1998-2015\n36\n4.2.6.\tUnderstanding the Demand of Soft Drinks in Portugal\nSDpc = Po + P1 * Year + 02 * ?\u00b0P + P3* JNpc + 04* PWpc + fi5* MaxTemp + fi6* Educ\n+ fi7 * GDPpc + p8 * Tax + s\nStarting with the R analysis, the first AIC test that was performed to assess the relative quality of this model and as it is possible to observe in Annex 5 the two only variables to be excluded from this model are the economic ones: GDPpc and Tax.\nSince the AIC does not inform about the absolute quality of the model, it is necessary to confirm the validity of this information, and 4 models were developed and shown in Annex 6 and the final model in Annex 7.\nModel 1 includes all the variables and has it is possible to see, 4 of the variables were not statistically significant (MaxTemp, GDPpc, Educ and Tax) and the adj. R2 was 0.966.\nFor the Model 2, the variable Tax, which was the one with the highest p-value in the previous one, was removed and as consequence of that the variable MaxTemp is now statistically significant in a confidence interval of 90%, the Year and Constant went from a 90% to 95% confidence interval and PWpc from 95% to 99% and the overall fitness of the model the adjusted R2 increased to 0.969. Still the GDPpc and Educ are not significant.\nIn model 3, the GDPpc was removed, which made the Year gain more significance and increase the adjusted R2 to 0.972 but the Educ is still not significant.\nLastly, in model 4, the final one, this variable is removed and the final result is the regression that follows:\nSDpc = Po + P1* Year + fl2 * Pop + fl3* JNpc + fl4* PWpc + fl5* MaxTemp + \u00a3\no SDpc = 2511.52763 - 1.51542 * Year + 43.02935 * Pop + 5.20023 * JNpc + 0.15192\n* PWpc + 4.00886 * MaxTemp + \u00a3\nInterpretation of the coefficients\n\u2022\tConstant:fl0 = 2511.52763. If all of the remaining factors are zero, the consumption of soft drinks per person will be on average 2511.52763 litres. However, this value does not have a meaningful interpretation, due to the fact that several variables cannot be 0, namely the year, that starts at 1998, population whose minimum value is 10.16 million, as it is shown in the summary of the Database in Annex 4, and Maximum temperature with at least 20.72\u00b0C.\n\u2022\tYear: P1 = \u2014 1.51542. If the variable Year increases 1 year, the consumption of SD per capita will decrease, on average, 1.51542 litres per person, ceteris paribus.\n37\n\n\n\n\nPopulation:\t= 43.02935. If the variable Population increases 1 million, the\nconsumption of SD per capita will increase, on average, 43.0235 litres per person, ceteris paribus. In a more realistic analysis, the population has varied yearly, in the last 18 years, approximately 100000, 1% of 1 million, will increase 0.430235 litres per person, which represents 0.6% of the average consumption of soft drinks.\nJuices &amp; Nectars:\t= 5.20023; If the consumption per capita of Juices and Nectars\nincreases 1 litre per person, the consumption of SD per capita will increase, on average, 5.20023 litres per person, ceteris paribus.\nPackaged Water:\t= 0.15192; If the consumption per capita of Packaged Water\nincreases 1 litre per person, the consumption of SD per capita will increase, on average, 0.15192 litres per person, ceteris paribus.\nMaximum Temperature:\t= 4.00886; If the Maximum Temperature increases 1\u00b0C, the\nconsumption of SD per capita will increase, on average, 4.00886 litres per person, ceteris paribus, or a 1.16% increase in the case of a 1% increase in temperature.\n38\n4.2.7.\tUnderstanding the Demand of Juices &amp; Nectars in Portugal\nIn this section, an OLS regression will be done in order to understand the independent variables that influence the dependable variable representing the Juices &amp; Nectars. And the initial function is as follows:\nJNpc = Po + Pi* Year + ft2 * SDpc +\t* PWpc + fl4 * Pop + P5* MaxTemp + P6* Educ\n+ P7 * GDPpc + p8 * Tax + s\nThe procedure is the same as the one followed in the Soft Drinks sub-chapter, where initially an AIC test, which is in Annex 8, to have an idea of the relative quality of the model in question and the results were the same as the ones observed in the SD, where it showed that GDPpc and tax were not contributing to the relative quality of the model.\nTo confirm these, several alternatives were run and they are all included in Annex 9, until the fittest model and variable were found (Annex 10).\nJNpc = Po + Pi_ * Year + p2* Pop + fi3* SDpc + 04* PWpc + +05 * Educ + \u00a3\nJNpc = -1322 + 0.7084 * Year \u2014 8.630 * Pop + 0.1524 * SDpc \u2014 0.03657 * PWpc\n\u2014 0.006778 * Educ + \u00a3\nInterpretation of the coefficients\n\u2022\tConstant: p0 = \u20141322; If all of the remaining factors are zero, the consumption of Juices and Nectars per person will be on average -1322 litres. As explained before this does not have a meaningful interpretation, adding also to the fact that consumption in litres can never be negative.\n\u2022\tYear: P-i = 0.7084. If the variable Year increases 1 year, the consumption of JN per capita will increase, on average, 0.7084 litres per person, ceteris paribus.\n\u2022\tPopulation: P2 = \u2014 8.630. If the variable Population increases 1 million, the consumption of JN per capita will decrease, on average, 8.630 litres per person, ceteris paribus. In a more realistic analysis, if the population varied approximately 100000, the consumption would decrease 0.08630 litres per person.\n\u2022\tSoft Drinks:: p3 = 0.1524; If the consumption per capita of Soft Drinks increases 1 litre per person, the consumption of JN per capita will increase, on average, 0.1524 litres per person, ceteris paribus.\n39\n\u2022\tPackaged Water:\t= -0.03657; If the consumption per capita of Packaged Water\nincreases 1 litre per person, the consumption of JN per capita will decrease, on average, 0.003657 litres per person, ceteris paribus.\n\u2022\tEducation:\t= -0.006778; If 1000 people more decide to further their education and\nhave superior education, the consumption of JN per capita will decrease, on average, 0.006778 litres per person, ceteris paribus.\n4.3.Further Analysis of the Explicative Factors\n4.3.1.\tThe effect of the Beverages on each other\nWhen it comes to SD and PW the relationship is positive, with the increase of 1% in JN leading SD to increase 0.74%, on average, in terms of percentage, and somewhat expected since in the graphic analysis done before, there were some indications of similar movements which seems to indicate that when consumers have budget they decide to allocate part for each one, as they are perceived as complementary.\nThe same complementarity is observed between PW and SD, with the increase of 1% in PW leading SD to an increase of 0.22%, on average, as we could see in the graphic analysis the movements between the two were very similar with the difference that the PW grew ate a much higher rate.\nIn the case of PW and JN, the relation is negative, with the increase of 1% in PW leading JN to decrease 0.34%, on average, which indicates that there is a certain level of substitution between the two and that is why in the graphic analysis was difficult to assess the relationship between them.\n4.3.2.\tThe effect of the Population in Consumption\nIt is always important to take into account the population growth in order to understand if the increase/decrease of the consumption was masque due to the fact that there are more/less people consuming the product. In Portugal, the population has decreased since 2009 1.5%, justified manly by these sociological issues: the low birth rate, the aging population and the emigration, aggravated by the crisis that forced individuals of the working force who could not find employment or stability to emigrate or postpone their family plans.\n40\nAs seen in the chapter before, there is a negative relation between the population and the intake of juices and nectars while that relation is positive for the Soft drinks, which means that in the case of the Juices and Nectars, the total amount of litres consumed by all the Portuguese citizens may be even increasing but not as much as the population, which leads to a decrease of consumption per capita. The opposite happens with the Soft Drinks that have an increase in total consumption bigger than the increase of the population.\n4.3.3.\tThe effect of the Education in Consumption\nThe independent variable Education is only significant for Juices and Nectars and has a negative effect on it. This can be easily explained by the fact that people with more years of education can understand more easily food label, do consult it more during the purchasing process (Rothman et al., 2006) and are aware that, despite the fact that juices are healthier than soft drinks, it is still a very concentrated amount of sugars and even though it can complement the consumption of daily recommended intake of fruit and vegetables, it is not the perfect substitute to actual fruit and vegetables. (Naska et al., 2010)\nWhen it comes to the fact that the consumption of Soft Drinks are not explained by Education, the reason may be related to the fact that more educated people if wanting to consume Soft Drinks they will probably shift to low/zero calorie alternative.\nThis is one of the most important trends registered in the Portuguese Market when it comes to Soft Drinks with an increase of 192%, verified from 2009 to 2015, which in terms of CAGR means an increase of 20% every year. (UNESDA, 2015)\nIn 2009, the low calorie versions accounted only 43.62 million of litres of the total soft drinks consumption of 838.1 million, representing only 5%. In 2015, the same set of products reached 18% of the soft drinks with 127.26 million litres of 688.30 overall. (UNESDA, 2015)\nComparing with the average of the EU, in the same period, the growth was around 7% with a CAGR of 1.4% per year.\nTable 8: Importance of the Low Calorie Soft Drinks in Portugal, 2009-2015\nPORTUGAL\t2009\t2010\t2011\t2012\t2013\t2014\t2015\nTotal\t838,1\t854,1\t799,2\t699,6\t689,1\t689,4\t688,3\nLow Calorie\t43,62\t43,65\t43,88\t40,85\t45,17\t101,52\t127,26\n% of the Total\t5,20%\t5,11%\t5,49%\t5,84%\t6,55%\t14,73%\t18,49%\nSource: UNESDA, 2016\n41\nTable 9: Importance of the Low Calorie Soft Drinks in the European Union, 2009-2015\nEU\t2009\t2010\t2011\t2012\t2013\t2014\t2015\nTotal\t48856.1\t49185.9\t49820.7\t49309.2\t48563.0\t47792.2\t49205.0\nLow Calorie\t8326.6\t8575.6\t8810.1\t8822.3\t8830.7\t8923.6\t9840.1\n|% of the Total\t17%\t17.4%\t17.7%\t17.9%\t18.2%\t18.7%\t20.0%\nSource: UNESDA, 2016\nThese numbers can denote an increasing health consciousness, but since in this database Soft Drinks include both the full caloric option and the light one in its total, the effect of education can be camouflaged in the switch from one to another.\n4.3.4.\tThe effect of the Temperature in Consumption\nThe variable in question only influences the consumption of sugary drinks and not the juices and nectars and reason behind this conclusion may be the seasonal nature of the soft drinks, which are known for its refreshing attributes (Grandjean et al., 2000) that on summer days can help maintain the body hydrated and re-establish the vitamins and minerals lost through sweat.\nIn the next tables it is possible to notice that the sub-sector of soft drinks is very dependent of the second part of the year, more particularly the months of July, August and September, and has become increasingly seasonal throughout the years, going from a 41% of consumption in the first semester to 31% in just 5 years.\nThis is a real concern for the companies who operate in the soft drinks market of Portugal, who have tried to battle this seasonality with marketing campaigns, as for example the one that Sumol+Compal, one of the biggest Portuguese player in the sector, had a few years ago, for a soft drink called Sumol, whose mottos were \u201cWinter is psychological\u201d and \u201c365 days of Summer\u201d, appealing to the fact that this drinks should be also consumed when its colder.\nJuices and Nectars, on the other hand, are linked to main meals in family all year around and thus are slightly less affected by seasonality, with values very closed to 50% for the first semester.\n42\nTable 10: Consumption of Soft Drinks during the 1st Semester, millions of litres, 2006-2010\nSOFT DRINKS\t2006\t2007\t2008\t2009\t2010\nConsumption 1st Semester\t323.27\t310.01\t296.39\t276.46\t267.6\nTotal Yearly Consumption\t790.193\t746.732\t831.0\t838.1\t854.1\n% of the Total\t41%\t41.5%\t36%\t33%\t31.3%\nSource: Canadean, 2010\nTable 11: Consumption of Juices &amp; Nectars during the 1st Semester, millions of litres, 2007-\n2010\nJUICES &amp; NECTARS\t2007\t2008\t2009\t2010\nConsumption 1st Semester\t52.60\t52.80\t52.59\t57.36\nTotal Yearly Consumption\t103.5\t111.4\t113.6\t116.1\n% of the Total\t51%\t47%\t46%\t49%\nSource: Canadean, 2010\n4.3.5. The effect of the Economic Factors in consumption\nAs a domino effect from the world recession of 2008, Portugal fell into a near state of bankruptcy, that lead to a request to IMF, Euro group and European Central Bank (ECB), a financial assistance whose pillars where based on a cut on expenses and raise on income.\nWith record levels of unemployment, reduced disposable income from one side and from the other an increase in VAT and contributions to the social security, Portuguese citizens were confronted with very difficult financial situations on a micro level. In order to overcome these problems, the average consumers shifted their behavior and habits drastically and that was particularly observed on their grocery shopping. (Marktest, 2015)\nSubstitution was a very important factor to take into account by reducing the consumption of more expensive basic needs, for example cow meat, and transfer to cheaper options available such as pork or chicken, the same way soft drinks and bottled water were substituted with tap water and more inexpensive and private labels that now represent 1/3 of consumption. (Marktest, 2015)\nAlso as a measure to increase the revenues, the VAT increased for the considered nonessential goods this also included beverage. In the case of bottled water the VAT increased from the lowest taxation level of 6% to the medium one of 13% while all the others commercial drinks jumped from 6% to the maximum 23%. (Silva et al., 2011)\n43\nIn this study both the indicators were not significant in neither soft drinks or juices and nectars. And the reason why this happened may be link to the undershafting of the price referred in the literature review chapter, that lead many manufacturers and distributers to absorb the tax in hopes not to lose more clients, that the ones that the crisis took itself.\nThe case was particularly evident in the Restaurant sector, as the general-secretary of the Portuguese Association of Restaurants and Similar, in the International Tourism Forum explained that 69% of the smallest and family businesses in the sector were in a near bankruptcy state and to avoid that did not pass the increased VAT rate to the consumer so its prices were attractive enough to maintain the demand. (Nunes, 2016)\nThis was also complemented with major promotions in supermarkets and hypermarkets and an increased supply of products of private label that maintain the consumptions in litres more stabilized. (Marktest, 2015)\n4.4.Empirical and Policy Implications\nMost possible this tax would not be significant in terms of combating the obesity level and one of explanations may be that the level of consumption of sugars in Portugal is much lower than the recommended by the World Health Organization of 90g, while in Portugal the consumption is 51.2g per day. (Ferdman, 2015)\nIn the case of fat, the scenario is very different, with a daily intake of 63.4g, very close to the recommended limit of 70gr. (Ferdman, 2015)\nThe difference is even more alarming when examining the consumption of salt of the Portuguese population that, with 10.7g, represents more than double the recommended 5.1g (Gra\u00e7a, 2013), even though a decreasing trend is been observed over the last few years there is still the need to accelerate this trend in order to diminish the effects of the most deadly diseases in Portugal, the cardiovascular ones (Law, 2000) and also some types of cancers (D\u2019Elia et al.,2012) that have been linked to excessive consumption of salt.\nnutritional traffic light system, informative campaigns in schools, hypermarkets and TV broadcast. (DGS, 2016)\nIn the future if this sugar tax would be implemented in Portugal, a couple of ideas must be applied: first, it is crucial to find a way that manufacturers and distributors do not absorb the tax as it has happen with the increase in the VAT, secondly it is needed that this tax is accompanied by educational campaigns in schools, university and media so it is not perceived as a punishment, lastly its revenue should be transferred for the national health system in order to validate the benefits of the measure and engage the consumers.\n45\n5.\tCONCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS\n5.1.Conclusions\nThis paper was set out to understand the potential impact that a tax affecting sugary drinks in Portugal as an attempt to increase the obesity levels and also to find a way of increasing the revenues of a very indebted national health system.\nThis type of sin tax has been very popular in the last few years with countries such as France and UK applying them to their market in hopes to mitigate the negative externalities that the overconsumption of these products may bring.\nPortugal also has showed is interest in such a measure with the Ministry of Health alongside with the Ministry of the Economy sharing in June 2016 that they are considering this measure to be implemented in 2017. The interesting fact for the case of Portugal is that although the obesity levels are slightly above the EU average there is still a very small consumption of this beverages, compared with other countries whose consumption doubles ours but have lower obesity levels such as Germany.\nTaking these aspects into consideration, the aim of this paper was to answer the two following questions:\n1.\tWhat was the contribution of the crisis in Portugal and the increased tax over beverages in the consumption of sugary drinks?\n2.\tWhat other factors influence the consumption and to what extent?\nThe methodology chosen to complete this task was the aggregation of secondary data on several national, European and International reputable sources that will be then analysed graphically and statistically in Excel and R, were two linear models, one for JN and other for SD was run with 8 independent variables that were excluded in order to achieve the model whose variables were more significant and the overall fit was greater.\nTo sum up, the present paper showed three major conclusions.\nFirst and foremost, both the GDP and the increased tax imposed in the beginning of 2012 showed no credible influence on the consumption, probably thanks to the fact that this tax was absorbed by the manufacturers and distributers as well as the brands followed a low price strategy based on frequent promotions in order not to lose customers and profit.\nSecondly, the soft drinks are influenced by the Maximum Temperatures due to its light and refreshing characteristics that improve hydration levels.\n46\nFinally, the Juices &amp; Nectars are influenced by the Education Level. This is due to the fact that more literate people understand better that even though it is manly made with fruit it still has a great amount of sugars and that juices do not replace fruit itself.\nThe main ideas from these studies that should be taken into account by the Portuguese Decision Makers if they want to pursue the application of a successful SSB tax are:\n\u2022\tA mechanism that prevents manufacturers and distributors from absorbing the tax needs to be developed;\n\u2022\tBe more than just a tax and have an impactful meaning, such as financing the health system and improving the general knowledge about the topic;\n\u2022\tIt will need to be followed by other ingredients such as excessive salt and fat in order to tackle other primary sources of obesity in Portugal.\n5.2.Limitations\nThe study aim was to offer some perspective on a crucial topic in terms of national policy making and was developed with the usage of secondary data from national and European organizations. As a consequence of this, the study faces numerous limitations, which are explained in the next few paragraphs.\nOne of the most crucial limitations was felt right at the beginning and forced a reshape of the initial intended objective which was explaining the whole flow from the moment a tax is implemented to the potential effect on the national obesity level, and passing the intermediate steps of decreased demand and caloric intake. Instead, only the first question of the possible effect that a tax can have on the consumption was answered, as well as the drivers of demand for Soft Drinks and Juices &amp; Nectars.\nIn the impossibility of completing the link to obesity was due to the lack of data on this matter that was either not calculated on a yearly basis or it may have a questionable accuracy, since there was a sense in the medical community that it was only needed to report and take action in situations of obesity and be condescending in overweight cases.\nAnother major difficulty felt was the inconsistency of the data since there is very detailed data for each sub-category from 2010 to 2014, but for all of the remaining years studied there is only information for the three main groups: Soft Drinks; Juices &amp; Nectars and Packaged Water, which forced this study to be more general.\n47\n5.3.Future Research\nOne of the first idea for future research may be investigating the consequences of a sugar tax in terms of obesity levels in the Portuguese society, but the options are virtually endless, taking into account the fact that this topic has not been overly studied worldwide and at the same time it is a very current and in vogue topic, with several countries considering this sin tax.\nSome ideas besides the latter one can be divided into two axis: the first one connected to the substitution effect and try to comprehend if the association between the tax and decreased caloric intake is true and effectively the consumers change their behaviour to incorporate in their diet alternatives with far less sugars or none at all, such as reduced and light beverages, milk and tap water, or if, on the other hand, the substitution was directed to sweeter alternatives such as chocolate, candy or ice cream.\nMoreover, an analysis divided by sugar content could also be developed, because, as we have seen, sugar taxes that have been implemented until now have as their basis different degrees of tax depending on the grams per 100ml found in these beverages, so computing the variation for zero, light and full sugar versions may show different values for all and even show that some beverages may win over some new costumers that are looking for a healthier option to avoid or mitigate the effect of the tax.\nThe following axis is based on a more detailed study of the impact in the subcategories of soft drinks, for example try to understand if there is any difference between carbonated versus the non-carbonated and iced coffee and tea and if the explanatory variables are the same for the three and if they are is there a difference in terms of degree of influence.\nAdditionally, an analysis that also includes information by brand type would be fascinating , for instance, in order to try to grasp if private labels could win with such a tax due to the fact that many consumers with the increased price reach their maximum willingness to pay for manufacturer brand, and transfer their consumption to the less expensive option of private label or, on the contrary the loyalty, quality perception and differentiated positioning lead to a more inelastic demand for those Brands that could be little sensitive to this type of levy.\n48\nREFERENCES\nAdministra\u00e7\u00e3o Central do Servi\u00e7o de Sa\u00fade (2014), \u201cAnnual Report 2014\u201d, Lisbon: Ministry of Health, Lisbon 2014\nAmerican Heart Association, (2015), \u201cProcessed Foods: Where is all that salt coming from?\u201d (Updated: Dec 8, 2015); Available at: http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/PreventionTreatmentofHi ghBloodPressure/Processed-Foods-Where-is-all-that-salt-coming-from_UCM_426950_Article.jsp#.V7mW53NV4hE [Accessed: 5 March 2016]\nAndreyeva, T., Long, M.W., Brownell, K.D., (2010) \u201cThe impact of food prices on consumption: a systematic review of research on the price elasticity of demand for food\u201d.

Decreto lei n\u00b0225/2003.\nNectars (25%-99% Juice): The product obtained by adding water and / or sugar or honey to fruit juice with the following conditions:\n\u2022\tThe addition of sugars, honey or sweeteners is authorized in quantities not representing more than 20 % of the finished product in weight;\n\u2022\tRespect the minimum amount ofjuice or pulp expressed as a percentage by volume of the finished product. These minimum amounts are standardized as follows:\no 25% by volume to fruit with low acidity; naturally juicy and/or highly flavored (Ex: mangoes, bananas, guavas, papayas, acerola, etc.)\no 50% for fruit juices that have a natural balanced taste (apples, pears, peaches, citrus fruits except lime and lemon, pineapple, etc.)\nCarbonated Drinks: product with a minimum carbon dioxide content of 2 grams per litre.\n54\nIced Coffee and Tea: To both of these beverages there is no legal framework in the Portuguese Legislation, so there is the need to consult UNESDA (Union of EU Soft Drinks Associations) to understand the definition of both.\nFirstly, Tea Refreshing Beverages\u2019 flavour comes from tea leaves and/or herbal teas infused in hot water. After this step and still while hot they are sweetened with corn syrup or sugar. There is also the case of unsweetened tea drinks but the vast majority is sweetened. The next step, is to dilute with water and if desired add flavoured syrups, such as lemon, raspberry, lime, passion fruit, peach, orange, strawberry, and cherry. Furthermore there is also incorporated the additive citric acid, that can be either labelled as \"flavour\" or as a \"preservative\u201d. Lastly the drink must be refrigerated and served cold. To sum up, it is a beverage with tea or tea extracts that is sweetened and diluted and can contain or not syrups for a more fruity taste and has preservatives that ensure a longer life-shelve.\nCoffee refreshing drinks have as a base simple \u201cblack\u201d coffee that can be served simply chilled or add some components depending on the culture of the population. The most common one are milk products (milk, cream, non-dairy substitutes), spices (cinnamon), chocolate and sweeteners such as syrups, granulated sugar, brown sugar, honey and artificial ones.
