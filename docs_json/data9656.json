In multiferroic composites, the\ncoupling magnetoelectric is due to elastic interaction between ferromagnetic and\nferroelectric phases caused by the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive effect.\n\nThe strategy of this work encompass: i) the preparation of porous thin films of\nferroelectric barium titanate; ii) the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles to be\nincorporated in the previous porous films and iii) the functionalization of the\nferroelectric porous matrix aiming to fabricate multiferroic nano composite. The\ncomposite system BaTiO3-CoFe2O4 was chosen due to the piezoelectricity of\nBaTiO3, thus allowing strong elastic interaction between the two phases, and good\nmagnetostriction of CoFe2O4. For materials synthesis, easy, environmental friendly\nand cost effective methodologies were adopted: i) evaporation induced self-\nassembly (EISA) assisted by dip-coating to prepare porous ferroelectric matrix; ii)\nhydrothermal synthesis to prepare magnetic nanoparticles and iii) electrophoretic\ndeposition for functionalization.\n\nThe BaTiO3 thin films were obtained using polystyrene-poly(ethylene oxide)\nblock co-polymer (PS-b-PEO) as template to create porosity. The effect of a\npolymer with different molecular weights (Mw) in the creation of porosity,\nconcentration of block co-polymer, type of annealing and withdrawal rate of the dip-\ncoating were studied in this work. The porous microstructure of BaTiO3 thin films\nwere studied by SEM. Decomposition of the solvents and BaTiO3 crystallization was\nstudied by DTA/TGA. The topography and piezoelectric behaviour of porous films\nwas analysed by AFM/ PFM.\n\nCoFe2O4 nanoparticles were obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. The effect of\ntemperature and time of the hydrothermal synthesis, the addition of\npolyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as additive with different concentrations, and effect of\nprecipitating (NaOH) and Co2+/Fe3+ concentration were studied in order to prepare\nnanoparticles with desired size and magnetic properties. The shape, size,\ndispersion and crystallinity of the nanoparticles were studied by various techniques\nsuch as TEM, BET and XRD. The crystallite size was calculated by Scherrer\nequation. The magnetic properties were evaluated by SQUID magnetometer. The\nresults show that with the increase of temperature and time synthesis the particle\nand crystallite size increases too. The saturation magnetization depends of particles\nsize, increasing with particle size increase. The increasing particle size from 12.9 to\n16.1 nm provokes an increase in saturation magnetization from 53.7 to 73.2 emu/g.\nIn time of hydrothermal synthesis studies, it was observed that a antiferromagnetic\nphase appear, hematite (?-Fe2O3). The presence of this phase damaged drastically\nthe magnetic properties to 8.2 emu/g in the case of a sample prepared over 24 h.\nThe PVP addition does not affect the shape of nanoparticles however favours their\ngrowth from 20.1 to 23.6. In term of magnetic properties, no influence was\nobserved. The increase of Co2+/Fe3+ and NaOH concentration induces growth of\nnanoparticles.\n\nThe functionalization of BaTiO3 films was made by electrophoretic deposition\n(EPD). Initially, the process optimization was necessary by studying the different\nparameters related with deposition such as: applied voltage, deposition time and\nsuspension type. This studies permits to conclude that with time increasing, the\namount of nanoparticles deposited increases too. It was observed that, despite the\noptimization of EPD, it is important the use a good quality substrate that can afford\nvoltage application.\n\n\n\n\n\npalavras-chave Filmes ferroel\u00e9tricos porosos, nanopart\u00edculas ferromagn\u00e9ticas, multiferroicos, s\u00edntese\nhidrotermal, deposi\u00e7\u00e3o eletrofor\u00e9tica.\n\nresumo Materiais multiferr\u00f3icos s\u00e3o por defini\u00e7\u00e3o materiais que exibem simultaneamente\npropriedades ferroel\u00e9tricas e ferromagn\u00e9ticas. Dado o seu potencial de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o tanto\nnos em dispositivos electr\u00f3nicos existentes como em novos dispositivos devido ao seu\ncar\u00e1cter multifuncional, os materiais multiferr\u00f3icos t\u00eam atra\u00eddo consideravelmente o\ninteresse da comunidade cient\u00edfica. Infelizmente os materiais multiferr\u00f3icos existentes\ns\u00e3o raros e exibem propriedades bastante inferiores \u00e0s necess\u00e1rias para a sua\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim \u00e9 absolutamente fundamental desenvolver materiais multiferr\u00f3icos\ncomp\u00f3sitos. Em comp\u00f3sitos multiferr\u00f3icos, o acoplamento magnetoel\u00e9trico deve-se \u00e0\nintera\u00e7\u00e3o el\u00e1stica entre as fases ferroel\u00e9trica e ferromagn\u00e9tica causada pelo efeito\npiezoel\u00e9ctrico e magnetostritivo.\n\nA estrat\u00e9gia deste trabalho engloba: i) a prepara\u00e7\u00e3o de filmes finos porosos de\ntitanato de b\u00e1rio ferroel\u00e9trico; ii) a s\u00edntese de nanopart\u00edculas magn\u00e9ticas para serem\nincorporadas nos filmes porosos e iii) a funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o da matriz ferroel\u00e9trica porosa\nvisando fabricar um nano comp\u00f3sito multiferr\u00f3ico. O sistema composto BaTiO3-CoFe2O4\nfoi escolhido devido \u00e0 piezoeletricidade do BaTiO3, permitindo uma intera\u00e7\u00e3o el\u00e1stica\nforte entre as duas fases, e boa magnetostri\u00e7\u00e3o do CoFe2O4. Para a s\u00edntese dos\nmateriais, foram adotadas metodologias simples, de baixo custo e amigas do ambiente:\ni) a evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) assistida por dip-coating para preparar a\nmatriz ferroel\u00e9trica porosa; ii) s\u00edntese hidrotermal para preparar nanopart\u00edculas\nmagn\u00e9ticas e iii) deposi\u00e7\u00e3o eletrofor\u00e9tica para a funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos filmes porosos.\n\nOs filmes finos porosos de BaTiO3 foram obtidos utilizando o co-pol\u00edmero em bloco\npoliestireno-poli(\u00f3xido de etileno) - PS-b-PEO para criar a porosidade. Foram estudados\nos efeito da varia\u00e7\u00e3o: i) do peso molecular do co-pol\u00edmero; ii) da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o do co-\npol\u00edmero em bloco; iii) do tipo de tratamento t\u00e9rmico e iv) da taxa de retirada da\ndeposi\u00e7\u00e3o por dip-coating. A microestrutura porosa dos filmes finos de BaTiO3 foi\nestudada por SEM. A decomposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos solventes e a cristaliza\u00e7\u00e3o do BaTiO3 foram\nseguidas por an\u00e1lises t\u00e9rmicas. A topografia e o comportamento piezoel\u00e9ctrico dos\nfilmes porosas foram analisados por AFM/ PFM.\n\nAs nanopart\u00edculas de CoFe2O4 foram obtidas por s\u00edntese hidrotermal. Foram\nestudados o efeito da temperatura, do tempo da s\u00edntese hidrotermal, da adi\u00e7\u00e3o de\npolivinilpirrolidona (PVP) como aditivo em diferentes concentra\u00e7\u00f5es, e os efeitos da\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o do agente precipitante (NaOH) e dos i\u00f5es Co2+/Fe3+ com o objectivo de\npreparar nanopart\u00edculas com tamanho e propriedades magn\u00e9ticas adequadas. A forma,\no tamanho, dispers\u00e3o e cristalinidade das nanopart\u00edculas foram estudados atrav\u00e9s das\nt\u00e9cnicas TEM, BET e XRD. O tamanho da cristalite foi calculado pela equa\u00e7\u00e3o de\nScherrer. As propriedades magn\u00e9ticas foram avaliadas por medidas de magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o\nde SQUID. Os resultados mostram que aumento da temperatura e do tempo da s\u00edntese\nhidrotermal contribui para o aumento do tamanho da part\u00edcula e da cristalite. A\nmagnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o de satura\u00e7\u00e3o aumenta com o aumento do tamanho das part\u00edculas. O\naumento do tamanho das part\u00edculas de 12.9 para 16.1 nm provocou um aumento na\nmagnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o de satura\u00e7\u00e3o de 53.7 para 73.2 emu/ g. Nos estudos do tempo de s\u00edntese\nhidrotermal observou-se o aparecimento de uma fase antiferromagn\u00e9tica, hematite (? -\nFe2O3). A presen\u00e7a desta fase prejudicou drasticamente as propriedades magn\u00e9ticas \u2013\n8.2 emu/ g, no caso da amostra preparada durante 24 h. A adi\u00e7\u00e3o de PVP n\u00e3o afecta a\nforma das nanopart\u00edculas no entanto favorece o seu crescimento de 20.1 para 23.6 nm.\nRelativamente \u00e0s propriedades magn\u00e9ticas, nenhuma influ\u00eancia foi observada. O\naumento da concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de Co2+/Fe3+ e de NaOH induz o crescimento de\nnanopart\u00edculas e, consequentemente, aumenta a magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o de satura\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nA funcionaliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos filmes de BaTiO3 foi feita por deposi\u00e7\u00e3o eletrofor\u00e9tica (EPD).\nInicialmente, foi necess\u00e1ria a otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do processo, estudando os diferentes\npar\u00e2metros relacionados com a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o, tais como: tens\u00e3o aplicada, tempo de\ndeposi\u00e7\u00e3o e tipo de suspens\u00e3o. Este estudo permitiu concluir que, com o aumento do\ntempo, a quantidade de nanopart\u00edculas depositadas tamb\u00e9m aumenta. Observou-se\nque, para fazer EPD, \u00e9 importante o uso de um substrato de boa qualidade que seja\nest\u00e1vel \u00e0 aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de tens\u00e3o.\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nINDEX OF FIGURES .........................................................................................................................

Introduction\n\nIn 60\u2019s the computers were room-sized while nowadays the personal computers have 9\n\nmm of thickness, Figure 1.1.\n\nFigure 1.1 50 years old computer [1] (left) and 2000's notebook [2] (right).\n\nMoore\u2019s law, in 1965, predicted the exponential increase of the power density\n\nassociated with a decrease of size and power consumption of integrated circuits [3]. In the last\n\ndecades \u201cMore and More Moore\u201d has been the trend. However Moore\u2019s law is now reaching\n\nthe limit and making power management and development of multifunctional materials for\n\nnew devices an essential requirement of the microelectronic industry. Within this context,\n\nmultiferroics can have an important role because of the simultaneous conjugation of electric\n\nand magnetic properties in the same physical volume, allowing the electric control of the\n\nmagnetic response for storage and for processing (Figure 1.2).\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #1 | Introduction\n\n2\n\nFigure 1.2 Scheme of a voltage-controlled write head at a magnetic hard disk track. The magnetic\n\n\u201cwrite\u201d field is generated by an electric field at the magnetoelectric (ME) material [4].\n\nIt should be emphasised that the use of, electric field controlled devices produces much\n\nless Joule heating than magnetic devices switched with a current, allowing an interesting\n\nthermal management [4].\n\nThe single-phase multiferroics are rare and exhibit weak magnetoelectric (ME) coupling\n\nor it occurs at very low temperature for practical applications [5, 6]. As an alternative, the\n\ncomposite multiferroic combining piezoelectric and magnetic phases together in a\n\nheterostructures, show strong direct responses to electric or magnetic fields [7]. However, the\n\nmagnetoelectric coupling induced by strain due to piezoelectric and magnetostriction effect is\n\nstill relatively weak due to the limitation by the mechanical adhesion of the component\n\nphases.\n\n1.1. Objective\n\nThe aim of this work is to develop multiferroic nano composite thin films, exploiting\n\nlow cost and environmental friendly chemical based processes for the preparation of\n\nferroelectric thin films and magnetic nanoparticles. The strategy developed within this work\n\nencompass: i) the preparation of porous thin films, as ferroelectric matrix to be functionalized,\n\nii) the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticles to be incorporated in the previous porous films and\n\niii) the functionalization of the porous matrix aiming to fabricate multiferroic nano composite\n\nthin films for novel applications in electronics.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #1 | Introduction\n\n3\n\n1.2. Structure of this thesis\n\nThe content of this thesis is divided into 6 chapters. The following chapter, chapter 2, is\n\ndedicated to the basic concepts related with ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and multiferroic\n\nmaterials, as well as the State of the Art in the latter materials.\n\nIn chapter 3, the strategy of this work is presented, proposing a alternative design for\n\nmultiferroics materials in attempt to improve the magnetoelectric coupling. The experimental\n\nprocedure and materials are described in chapter 4, which is divided into four subchapters:\n\npreparation of ferroelectric thin films, synthesis of ferromagnetic nanoparticles,\n\nfunctionalization of thin films with nanoparticles and characterization techniques. Chapter 5\n\ndescribes and discuss the results. Conclusions and future work are presented in the final\n\nchapter.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarla F.

Basic concepts\n\n? Multiferroic materials\nThe term multiferroic, like the word itself (multi + ferroic), is used to describe materials\n\nthat exhibit simultaneously at least two of the three ferroic properties: ferroelectricity,\n\nferromagnetism or ferroelasticity [8, 9]. From the viewpoint of materials constituents,\n\nmultiferroic materials can be divided in two types: single-phase [5] and composite [10] ,\n\nwhich are described in sections 2.2 and 2.3, respectively.\n\nMagnetoelectric coupling describes the influence of a magnetic field on the polarization\n\nand the influence of an electric field on the magnetization of a material. It may arise directly\n\nfrom the two order parameters in a single-phase material or indirectly via strain/stress as in\n\nmultiferroic composite.\n\nThe coupling between the magnetic and ferroelectric order parameters leads to\n\nmagnetoelectric effects, in which the magnetization can be tuned by an applied electric field\n\nand polarization can be tuned by an applied magnetic field. Figure 2.1 shows the relationship\n\nbetween multiferroic and magnetoelectric coupling [9]. Ferromagnets (ferroelectrics) form a\n\nsubset of magnetically (electrically) polarizable materials such as paramagnets and\n\nantiferromagnets (paraelectrics and antiferroelectric). The intersection (red hatching)\n\nrepresents materials that are multiferroic. Magnetoelectric coupling (blue) is an independent\n\nphenomenon that can arise in any of the materials that are both magnetically and electrically\n\npolarizable [9].\n\nFigure 2.1 Relationship between multiferroic and magnetoelectric materials [9].\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n8\n\n? Ferroelectricity\nFerroelectricity is a property of materials which exhibit spontaneous electric\n\npolarization that can be reversed by an external electric field [11]. This polarization could be\n\nassociated to the movements of cations in relation to anions. When an electric field is applied,\n\norientation of dipoles creating domains of polarization occurs and this polarization remains\n\neven when the electric field is removed [12]. As the temperature is increased, a ferroelectric\n\nundergoes a phase transition, which is accompanied by the disappearance of spontaneous\n\npolarization due to a change in the symmetry of the crystal lattice. The temperature at which a\n\nphase transition occurs is called Curie temperature, TC.\n\nMost of the known ferroelectric materials have (above Tc) a cubic perovskite ABO3\nstructure with smaller \u201cB\u201d cations at the centre of the oxygen octahedron and larger \u201cA\u201d\n\ncations at the corner of the unit cell, Figure 2.2. Atoms of Pb, Ba, Ca, Sr typically occupy A-\n\nsites while Ti, Nb, Mg or Ta can be located at the B-site of the perovskite structure.\n\nCompounds like BaTiO3 and PbTiO3 are examples of ferroelectric materials [11-15]. Below\n\nthe Curie temperature there is a structural distortion to a lower symmetry phase accompanied\n\nby the off-centre shift of \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d cations relative to the \u201cO\u201d anions. The spontaneous\n\npolarization of the lower symmetry ferroelectric phase is due to the dipole moment created by\n\nthe shift of cations with respect to the anions [16].\n\nFigure 2.2 Crystallographic structure of ABO3 perovskite, adapted from Ref. [17].\n\nThe response of ferroelectric domains to an external electric field applied on\n\nferroelectric material can be described by the so-called ferroelectric hysteresis loop, illustrated\n\nin Figure 2.3.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n9\n\nFigure 2.3 Ferroelectric hysteresis loop (polarization vs. applied electric field), adapted from Ref.[16].\n\nSeveral points of the ferroelectric hysteresis loop are of interest: the spontaneous (Ps)\n\nand remanent (Pr) polarization, the coercive field (Pc) and the general shape of the loop. In a\n\nferroelectric material, when all of the dipole moments are aligned, the material is considered\n\nsaturated since an increase in the applied electric field will not increase more the polarization\n\n(segment b-c). The linear extrapolation of the curve back to the polarization axis ( ?)\nrepresents the spontaneous polarization (Ps). As the applied electric field is reduced from its\n\nmaximum positive value to zero, some dipole moments will remain aligned, and a remanent\n\n(Pr) polarization is observed. As the applied electric field spans the range from its maximum\n\npositive to negative values, -Ps and -Pr will be observed (f and g points in Figure 2.3,\n\nrespectively). In this state, all of the dipole moments will be switched from the positive to the\n\nnegative (up to down arrows) as shown in the blue boxes of the Figure 2.3.\n\nAll ferroelectric crystals are necessarily piezoelectric. The piezoelectricity effect is a\n\nphenomenon resulting from a coupling between the electrical and mechanical properties of a\n\nmaterial. There are two types of piezoelectric effect: direct and inverse. In a direct\n\npiezoelectric effect, when a mechanical stress (designated by F in Figure 2.4) is applied to a\n\npiezoelectric material, an electric potential will be generated.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n10\n\nFigure 2.4 Direct piezoelectric effect: mechanical stress applied results in a voltage [18].\n\nIn case of inverse piezoelectric effect, when a voltage is applied to the piezoelectric, a\n\nmechanical strain will occur (Figure 2.5).\n\nFigure 2.5 Inverse piezoelectric effect: voltage applied results in a deformation [18].\n\nThe basic equations 1.1 and 1.2 describe these two effects, respectively, in regard to\n\nelectric and elastic properties:\n\n= + Eq. 1.1= + Eq. 1.2\nwhere, D is the dielectric displacement vector, ? is the tensor of dielectric constants\n\n(superscript T indicates a constant stress), E is the electric field vector, d is the tensor of\n\npiezoelectric constants, T is the mechanical stress, S is the mechanical strain tensor and s is\n\nthe tensor of mechanical compliance (superscript E indicates a constant electric field) [19].\n\nPiezoelectric materials are utilized in transducers, devices that convert electrical energy into\n\nmechanical strains, or vice versa. Applications that employ piezoelectrics include, among\n\nothers, microphones, ultrasonic generators, sonar detectors.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n11\n\n? Ferromagnetism\nThe elements iron, cobalt and nickel, together with some of the rare-earth elements,\n\npossess at sufficiently low temperature a magnetic moment even in the absence of an applied\n\nfield. This property characterised by a spontaneous magnetization is known as\n\nferromagnetism [20]. Permanent magnetic moments result from atomic magnetic moments\n\ndue to electron spin-uncancelled as a consequence of the electron structure. Only atoms with\n\npartially filled shells with unpaired spins can exhibit a net magnetic moment in the absence of\n\nan external magnetic field. Furthermore, in a ferromagnetic material, coupling interactions\n\ncause net spin magnetic moments of adjacent atoms to align with another, even in the absence\n\nof an external field. This mutual spin alignment exists over relatively large volume regions of\n\nthe crystal called magnetic domains, Figure 2.6.\n\nFigure 2.6 Schematic representation of domains in a ferro- or ferrimagnetic material. Arrows\n\nrepresent atomic magnetic dipoles. Within each domain, all dipoles are aligned, whereas the direction\n\nof alignment varies from one domain to another [21].\n\nAccording to the response to the external magnetic field, the material can be classified\n\ninto: ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic [22]. In ferromagnetic\n\nmaterials, the electron spins are aligned parallel to each other at absolute zero, Figure 2.7.\n\nHowever, this behaviour depends on the temperature. When a certain temperature is reached\n\nthe ferromagnetism completely disappears and the material becomes paramagnetic. This\n\ntemperature is called Curie temperature. If the material is cooled above its Tc the\n\nferromagnetic domains reform and the materials becomes ferromagnetic again. In contrast to\n\nferromagnetic, an antiferromagnetic behaviour corresponds to an antiparallel alignment of\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n12\n\nequal moments. Finally, ferrimagnetic behaviour is characterized by antiparallel moments\n\nhaving different magnitudes.\n\nFigure 2.7 Different alignments of magnetic dipoles. Adapted from Ref.[22].\n\nThe application of a relatively small external magnetic field changes the domain\n\narrangement, and hence induces an appreciable change in magnetization. Both ferro- and\n\nferrimagnetic materials exhibit a hysteric response to an external magnetic field, as shown in\n\nright side of Figure 2.8.\n\nFigure 2.8 Domain configurations during several stages of magnetization (left side) and\n\nferro/ferrimagnetic hysteresis loop (right side), adapted from Ref. [21].\n\nDuring the magnetization of a ferro/ferrimagnetic material, as the applied magnetic field\n\nincreases from zero, magnetization value increases from zero and achieves saturation\n\nmagnetization, Ms. At this point, all magnetic domains are aligned. While decreasing the\n\nFerromagnetic Antiferromagnetic Ferrimagnetic\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n13\n\napplied field to zero, the original magnetization curve is not retraced, and it remains the\n\nmagnetization called remanent or residual magnetization. To decrease the magnetization to\n\nzero, it is required to apply a negative magnetic field with HC value, called coercive field.\n\nWhen the negative applied field is increased even more, the material achieves saturation\n\nmagnetization in reverse field, i.e. all magnetic moments are aligned but in opposite direction\n\nto Ms. Upon removing the reverse field, the magnetization returns to the remanent value. If\n\nthe magnetic field is continuously increased the magnetization will saturate again closing the\n\nhysteresis loop.\n\nThe size and shape of the hysteresis loop is of considerable practical importance. Based\n\non the value of a coercive field, magnetic materials are classified into hard for high HC and\n\nsoft magnets for small values of HC [20]. Soft magnetic materials are used in devices that are\n\nsubjected to alternating magnetic field. It can achieve high magnetization with low values of\n\nmagnetic field (i.e. it is easily magnetized and demagnetized). On the other hand, the hard\n\nmagnetic materials have high values of coercive field, thus utilized in permanent magnets (for\n\nexample memory storage) due to a high resistance to demagnetization.\n\nSimilar to piezoelectric effect on ferroelectric materials, if ferromagnetics will have a\n\nmechanical response when a magnetic field is applied, the phenomenon is called\n\nmagnetostriction [20]. When an applied field changes a state of magnetization of a\n\nferromagnetic material, it occurs a small change in its dimensions, provided by two reasons: i)\n\ndomain wall migration in response to an external magnetic field and ii) domain rotation. The\n\nlinear magnetostriction ? can be defined as\n\n?= ? Eq. 1.3\nwhere l is the original length of the specimen and ?l the magnetostrictive change.\n\n2.2. Single-phase multiferroics\n\nBy definition, a single-phase multiferroic shows simultaneously ferroelectricity and\n\nferromagnetism in a unique compound. There are very few single-phase multiferroic materials\n\nsuch as BiFeO3 [23-25], BiMnO3 [26-28], YMnO3 [24, 29-31].\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n14\n\nThe most widely single-phase studied multiferroic is bismuth ferrite, BiFeO3 (Figure\n\n2.9) [24, 32].\n\nFigure 2.9 Schematics of the crystal structure of BiFeO3 with polarization arrow in [111] direction\n\nand antiferromagnetic plan (shaded plans) [33].\n\nThe structure of BiFeO3 can be characterized by distorted perovskite with rhombohedral\n\nsymmetry and space group R3c. The primitive unit cell, shown in Figure 2.9, contains two\n\nformula units (10 atoms in total), arising from counter-rotations of neighbouring O octahedral\n\nabout the [111] axis. The R3c symmetry permits the development of a spontaneous\n\npolarization along [111], and Bi, Fe and O are displaced relative to one another along this\n\nthreefold axis. Therefore, the ferroelectric state is realized by a large displacement of the Bi\n\nions relative to the FeO6 octahedra. The Fe magnetic moments are coupled ferromagnetically\n\nwithin the pseudocubic (111) planes Figure 2.9. If the magnetic moments are oriented\n\nperpendicularly to the [111] direction, the symmetry also permits a canting of the\n\nantiferromagnetic sublattices resulting in a macroscopic magnetization, so-called weak\n\nferromagnetism [5, 24, 34].\n\nSome studies were carried out about polarization of single-phase multiferroic materials\n\nthin films and bulk. Teague et al. [35] published the first studies of polarization of bulk\n\nBiFeO3 in 1970. These measurements were made at 77 K revealing a spontaneous\n\npolarization of ~6.1 ?C/cm2 along the 111-direction. Nowadays the measured values are\n\nconverging to ~90 ?C/cm2 along the [111] direction of the pseudo-cubic perovskite unit cell,\n\nconsistent with first-principles calculations made by Neaton et al. [36].\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n15\n\n2.3. Composite multiferroics\n\nComposite multiferroics consist of two different phases, a ferroelectric and a ferro-\n\nferrimagnetic. To date, depending on the architecture of the composite, namely the design of\n\nthe interface-connectivity between the two components, three different heterostructures have\n\nbeen studied: particulate, horizontal and vertical, as represented in Figure 2.10. An\n\ninternationally accepted notation, first established for a series of composites by Newnham et\n\nal. [37] helps to describe and distinguish the connectivity character, using the dimensionality\n\nof each phase. Thus, in the particulate case with 0D particles dispersed into a 3D matrix\n\ncorresponds to 0-3 connectivity (Figure 2.10a), in the horizontal heterostructure, with 2D\n\nalternating layers correspond to a 2-2 connectivity (Figure 2.10b), while the vertical\n\nheterostructure, with 1D nanopillars dispersed to a 3D matrix, corresponds to a 1-3 structure\n\n(Figure 2.10c).\n\nFigure 2.10 Schematic illustration of three kinds of multiferroic composites nanostructures: a) 0-3\n\nParticulate, b) 2-2 Horizontal heterostructure and c) 1-3 Vertical heterostructure [10].\n\nIn 1972, van Suchtelen [38], in an attempt to describe the rising magnetoelectric (ME)\n\neffect in this kind of composites, proposed for the first time the concept of the product\n\nproperty, using the case of BaTiO3 and CoFe2O4 (equations 1.4 and 1.5). This concept can be\n\ndescribed as a \u201cchain\u201d reaction taking place between the two phases and yields the direct and\n\nthe converse ME effect. When a magnetic field is applied, occurs a mechanical strain in the\n\nferromagnetic phase, subsequently transferred to the ferroelectric one generating polarization\n\n(Eq. 1.4, Figure 2.11a). The second case claims the application of an electric field, which\n\nprovokes mechanical strain to the ferroelectric phase and, analogously to the prior case,\n\nevoking magnetization to the ferromagnetic counterpart (Eq. 1.5, Figure 2.11b). The direct\n\nand the converse ME effect can be described, respectively, by the equations [39]:\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n16\n\n= \u00d7 Eq. 1.4\n= \u00d7 Eq. 1.5\n\nFigure 2.11 Schematic illustration of strain-mediated ME effect in a composite system consisting of a\n\nmagnetic layer (purple) and ferroelectric layer (pink). (a) Represents a direct magnetoelectric effect\n\nand (b) represents a converse magnetoelectric effect [10].\n\n2.3.1. Horizontal heterostructures\n\nThe horizontal heterostructures, or else 2-2 composites, are the most widely studied,\n\nbecause they can be easily fabricated layer-by-layer and integrated in the devices. The\n\nthickness of the layers could be modulated at the nanometer level.\n\nThe highest ME voltage coefficient ever measured was achieved with laminate mm-\n\nthick Terfenol-D/PZT composites, prepared by conventional methods and reached 4680 mV\n\ncm-1 Oe-1 [40]. However, the ever-increasing demand for miniaturization has led to focus the\n\ninvestigation on thick and thin films.\n\nConcerning the materials of the current investigation, CoFe2O4 (CFO) and BaTiO3\n(BTO), in 2008 Wang et al. [41] grew BTO thin films (260 nm thick) by Pulsed Laser\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #2 | Review: multiferroic materials\n\n17\n\nDeposition technique (PLD) on CFO substrates, achieving ME voltage coefficient of 38 mV\n\ncm-1 Oe-1. A little bit earlier the same year, Zhang et al. [42], also using PLD, deposited BTO\n\nand CFO thin films, 70 nm and 20 nm thick respectively, on SrTiO3 (STO) substrates,\n\nachieving ME voltage coefficient of 104 mV cm-1 Oe-1. The viable mechanism of ME\n\ncoupling comes from strain-coupling among the piezoelectric and magnetostrictive\n\ncomponents of heterostructure. In case of horizontal heterostructures, the clamping effect of\n\nthe substrate effectively suppresses any in-plane strain in the film. Theoretically, this\n\nlimitation is minimized in vertical heterostructures if the contact area of the film with the\n\nsubstrate is lower than the interface area within the composite.\n\n2.3.2. Vertical heterostructures\n\nThe most common composition of vertical or 1-3 heterostructures are magnetic spinel\n\nnanopillars embedded into a ferroelectric perovskite matrix, usually epitaxially grown [24].\n\nThe high interfacial surface area together with intrinsic three-dimensional heteroepitaxial\n\ncharacter (ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and substrate lattice match) result in strong coupling\n\nbetween the two ferroic components. The most important advantage of 1-3 heterostructures is\n\nthe substantially low mechanical clamping effect related to the lattice constraint from the\n\nsubstrate.\n\nIn 2004, Zheng et al. [7] grew CFO nanopillars of 20-30 nm diameter in BTO thin film\n\non STO substrate, by PLD technique and proved the magnetoelectric behaviour by detecting a\n\nsharp change in magnetization at the Curie temperature. By the same procedure, Zavalinche et\n\nal. [43] composed CFO nanopillars in 200 nm thick BiFeO3 (BFO) films on STO substrate,\n\nwhich corresponded to a magnetic susceptibility of 10-2 G cm/V, similar to single crystalline\n\nbilayered composites. More recently, Yan et al. [44] measured ME voltage coefficient of 20\n\nmV cm-1 Oe-1, for CFO/BFO/STO (nanopillar/matrix/substrate) thin films of about 150-240\n\nnm thick.\n\nThe vertical heterostructures present in general better ME coupling than the horizontal\n\nstructures, however the coupling is still too low for practical uses. It is essential to develop\n\nalternative architectures to prepare multiferroic composite thin films that can ensure a good\n\ncontrol of the interfaces between ferroelectric and ferromagnetic phases.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarla F. Silva Multifunctional films from porous matrices\n\nStrategy\n\nof this thesis\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n21\n\n3. Strategy\tof\tthis\tthesis\n\n3.1. Introduction\n\nAs discussed before, the actual multiferroic composite architectures show low\n\nmagnetoelectric coupling. The aim of this work is the development of an alternative\n\narchitecture of multiferroic composites using simple and low cost methodologies. This\n\nalternative architecture consists of a porous thin film as ferroelectric matrix\n\nfunctionalized with ferromagnetic nanoparticles (Figure 3.1).\n\nFigure 3.1 Porous ferroelectric matrix functionalization with ferromagnetic nanoparticles.\n\nThe inspiration to this proposal comes from the use of lyotropic liquid-crystal\n\nphases as templates to develop porous structures [45]. These materials have ordered and\n\nporous structure with high specific surface areas and can be interesting matrices for the\n\npreparation of multiferroic composite with large interface areas. The idea is to prepare\n\nporous ferroelectric thin films, which would be later functionalized with ferromagnetic\n\nnanoparticles to form a multiferroic composite material.\n\n3.2. Porous ferroelectric thin films\n\nTraditionally porosity is undesired in electroceramics because it usually degrades\n\nthe electrical and mechanical properties of the material. However, for certain applications,\n\nporosity may be an advantage, such as for pyroelectric applications where is required a\n\nmaterial with piezoelectric properties but at the same time with low dielectric constant.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n22\n\nSensors and actuators are some examples of potential applications [13, 46-50].\n\nFurthermore, these porous structures can be seen as an avenue to achieve lighter materials\n\ngiving the opportunity to further use the voids to incorporate other functionalities in the\n\nsame volume. This is the case of the present work. Porous thin films can be interesting to\n\ndevelop multiferroic materials, by incorporating ferromagnetic nanoparticles in the pores\n\nof a ferroelectric matrix.\n\nThin films can be prepared through a great number of different techniques (Figure\n\n3.2). However, only some of them are able to produce porous thin films. The physical\n\ndeposition techniques are preferred in order to prepare dense thin films and chemical\n\ndeposition approaches are much more appropriate to the preparation of porous layers.\n\nFigure 3.2 Various processing methods used to prepare porous thin films [51].\n\nFrom chemical deposition techniques, spin-coating and dip-coating are commonly\n\nused in electronics and optics industries for instance, to prepare inorganic layers from sol-\n\ngel solutions. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks. For example, dip-coating, in\n\nwhich the substrate is successively dipped into the solution and withdrawn at a constant\n\nspeed, offers a good control of the thickness and produces no waste. However, the spin-\n\ncoating is preferred if one wants only one face to be deposited.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n23\n\nSome reported works describe the preparation of porous films by dip-coating and\n\nspin-coating [13, 48, 49, 52-54].\n\nTo obtain an optimised pyroelectric response of a material (figure of merit),\n\nporosity as been considered since it will decrease the dielectric constant [49]. Porous lead\n\nzirconate titanate (PZT) thin films were prepared by spin-coating of sol-gel solutions [48,\n\n49, 52]. The porosity was generated by using a polymer and could be controlled by using\n\npolymers with different molecular weights. Stancu et al [52] studied two different ways to\n\nproduce porous films by spin coating: (1) hydrolysis of precursor solution and (2) the\n\naddition of organic macromolecular polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). In case of hydrolysis,\n\nthe authors suggested that the porosity should develop when either the water or the\n\nsolvent has been removed during the pyrolysis step. For PVP case, the pores were\n\nproduced after pyrolysis of PVP, which was realised at high temperature. The\n\nferroelectric properties of the porous PZT films were compared to the equivalent dense\n\nPZT films and the properties were by far lower. The dielectric permittivity decreases from\n\n348 for dense film to 48 for porous films. Later, Stancu et al. [48] published another\n\nstudy describing the effect of porosity on ferroelectric properties of PZT films. In this\n\nwork, the authors prepared porous films with addition of different amounts of PVP. The\n\npore size increased by increasing the amount of polymer added to precursor solution and\n\nthis fact has an effect on the final film thickness. The addition of PVP makes the starting\n\nsolution more viscous leading to an increase of thickness after crystallization. The pores\n\nsize increased with increasing PVP, and lead to a high shrinkage of the film during\n\ncrystallization annealing. The electrical measurements showed that the presence of\n\nporosity in the films leads to a lower capacitance and lower dielectric constant. The\n\nauthors suggested that these films are good candidates for pyroelectric applications due to\n\nits lower permittivity (characteristic property). The porosity in these films is completely\n\nrandom.\n\nThe group of C. Sanchez have reported several papers on the fabrication of metallic\n\nand multimetallic oxides porous thin films [13, 46, 47, 53, 54]. The methods used to\n\nobtain porous thin films are evaporation induced self-assembly (EISA) combined with\n\ndip-coating of sol-gel solutions. EISA can be described like the conjugation of two\n\ncooperative effects. During the evaporation of the sol-gel solution containing the\n\ninorganic precursors and surfactant, the self-assembly of inorganic species occurs around\n\nthe surfactant micelles leading to mesophase formation, Figure 3.3.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n24\n\nFigure 3.3 Scheme of Evaporation-induced self-assembly associated to dip-coating, adapted from\n\nRef. [47].\n\nThe as-prepared thin films are xerogels where the organic template are embedded\n\ninto the inorganic matrix. The thermal treatment step is necessary after the deposition due\n\nto three important facts: i) it conducts to the stabilization of the mesophase, ii)\n\ndecomposition and elimination of the organic phase creating the porosity and iii)\n\ncrystallization of the network (Figure 3.4). The crystallization occurs through nucleation\n\nand growth of crystallized seeds and is followed by diffusive sintering if sufficiently high\n\ntemperature is maintained long enough. A fast nucleation leads usually to a large number\n\nof seeds created homogeneously into the inorganic network. Their subsequent growth into\n\nnanocrystallites is made by diffusion of the adjacent atoms towards the nucleus surface to\n\noccupy atomic sites of lower energy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n25\n\nFigure 3.4 Thermal treatment step involving: (1) pre-consolidation, (2) template removal and (3)\n\ninorganic network crystallization, adapted from Ref. [47].\n\nA. Fisher et al. [53] prepared well-ordered nanoperforated TiO2 layers by EISA\n\ncombined with dip-coating and studied the effect of molecular weight of surfactant on the\n\npores size. The higher molecular weight surfactants originated the biggest pores. The\n\nauthors suggest that the formation of such systems is possible through the precise balance\n\nof the interactions between the surfactant micelles, inorganic precursors, solvent phase\n\nand interfaces (film/air and film/substrate) during the different steps of evaporation\n\ndrying and thermal treatment.\n\nInvestigation of dip-coating of various sol-gel solutions using different withdrawal\n\nspeed conditions were reported by Faustini et al. [54]. At low withdrawal speeds, the film\n\nthickness is governed by the interdependence of continuous evaporation of the solvent at\n\nthe meniscus and the capillary rise at the drying line. At high speeds, the final thickness is\n\nmainly dependent on the viscous drag. At intermediate speeds, both phenomena, overlap\n\nand a critical speed, were found. Furthermore, a thickness lower limit exists that cannot\n\nbe overcome, except by dilution of the initial solution i.e., thinner films can be obtained\n\nwith high diluted solutions and/or by using at ultralow withdrawal speeds.\n\nMore recently, P. Ferreira et al. [13] reported the first study on synthesis and\n\nmeasurements of ferroelectric properties of porous PbTiO3 (lead titanate - PTO) and\n\nBaTiO3 films. The thermal processing used to convert the amorphous porous\n\nmesostructured multimetallic oxide thin films into a crystalline perovskite film is a key\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n26\n\npoint to achieve both size and shape monodispersity in particles and pore sizes and in\n\nkeeping nanoporosity. The obtained films showed piezoelectric and ferroelectric\n\nresponse, measured at the nanoscale. The authors suggested that these films are highly\n\npromising as platforms to construct multifunctional ordered distributed composite\n\nmaterials in which the original architecture of the pores are filled just before\n\ncrystallization.\n\nPZT and PTO are both good ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials, but they have\n\nlead in their constitution, which is a non-environmental friendly element. Nowadays, the\n\nscientific community has been paying special attention to develop substituents for lead\n\nbased materials \u2013 the so-called lead-free materials. BTO is a good example of lead-free\n\nferroelectric material. It is a well-know ceramic capacitor dielectric material for electronic\n\nindustry due to its high dielectric constant [11].\n\nLike referred in section 2.1-Ferroelectricity, BTO is a ferroelectric material with\n\nperovskite structure, Figure 3.5. Eight atoms of Ba2+, one atom of Ti4+ and six atoms of\n\nO2- compose the BaTiO3 unit cell.?\n\nFigure 3.5 BaTiO3 unit cell with a schematic representation of the possible developed\n\npolarization upon the application of an electric field.\n\nFigure 3.6 shows 3 different phase transitions of barium titanate. The arrows\n\nindicate the direction of polarization. Above the Curie temperature, BTO crystal\n\npossesses cubic structure (space group Pm3m). Below the Curie temperature (120\u00b0C), the\n\ncrystal turns into tetragonal (P4mm). Between 5\u00b0C and -90\u00b0C the structure is\n\northorhombic (Amm2), and rhombohedral (R3m) below of -90\u00b0C.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n27\n\nFigure 3.6 BaTiO3 unit cell in different crystallographic phases: a) cubic, b) tetragonal, c)\n\nrhombic and d) rhombohedral cell [15]. The arrows indicate the direction of spontaneous\n\npolarization (Ps).\n\nThe cubic structure is the only one does not show ferroelectric properties and it is\n\nparaelectric because the vibrations in the cubic structure promotes the random\n\ndisplacement of Ti4+ ion around its central position, there does not show any asymmetry\n\nor polarization. In the case of the tetragonal system, Ti4+ ion and the octahedral\n\narrangement of O2- ions move asymmetrically causing a permanent electric dipole\n\nmoment in the unit cell. Knowing that the oxygen octahedra are coupled, the\n\nneighbouring unit cells will also be polarized yielding domain structures. These domains\n\nare characterized by small volumes of material in which the electric dipole moments are\n\naligned in the same direction.\n\n3.3. Ferromagnetic nanoparticles\n\nMagnetic nanoparticles have attracted tremendous attention due to their novel\n\nproperties and their potential applications in magnetic recording, magnetic storage,\n\nbiotechnology and biomedicine [55, 56]. For example, in the case of magnetic recording\n\napplications a large remanent magnetization and moderate coercivity is required [57]. For\n\nsome of these mentioned applications of magnetic nanoparticles, the soft ferrites, such as\n\nmagnetite and maghemite, are thought to be the most suitable [20]. Cobalt ferrite,\n\nCoFe2O4, is a hard ferrite and displays some interesting characteristics in order to\n\ncompose a multiferroic material: good chemical stability, high magnetocrystalline\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n28\n\nanisotropy and large magnetostriction [20, 58]. The saturation magnetostriction (?s) of\n\nvarious materials at room temperature is given in Table 3.1.\n\nTable 3.1 Saturation magnetostriction of various materials at room temperature, adapted from\n\nRef. [20].\n\nMaterial\nSaturation magnetostriction\n\n?s (10-6)\n\nIron\n\nNickel\n\nMagnetite, (Fe3O4)\n\n-7\n\n-33\n\n+40\n\nCobalt ferrite -110\n\nSmFe2 -1560\n\nTerfenol D (Tb0.3Dy0.7Fe1.93) +2000\n\nThe high values of saturation magnetostriction of SmFe2 and Terfenol D are due to\n\nthe highly anisotropic shapes of Sm and Tb ions and to the large lanthanide-iron exchange\n\nenergy. Comparing the cases of magnetite and cobalt ferrite, the high magnetostriction in\n\nmaterials containing cobalt is due to the presence of the Co2+, from which there is a large\n\norbital contribution to the magnetic moment and hence a strong spin-orbit coupling,\n\nwhich increases the magnetostriction. The properties of cobalt ferrite depend on the\n\nmorphology and preparation method.\n\nSome methods have been studied to obtain magnetic nanoparticles such as: co-\n\nprecipitation [59, 60], thermal decomposition [61-63], micro-emulsion [64-66],\n\nsolvothermal and hydrothermal synthesis.\n\n? Co-precipitation\n\nCo-precipitation, or wet chemical route is a facile way to synthesize iron oxides\n\ncomposed from aqueous ionic salt solutions by the addition of a base under inert\n\natmosphere at room or elevated temperature. However, after the precipitation an\n\nannealing step is necessary to crystalize the material. The particles prepared by co-\n\nprecipitation tend to be rather polydisperse and with low magnetic properties when\n\ncompared with other processes. Zhang et al [59] prepared CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by co-\n\nprecipitation method. The authors studied the effect of base concentration (NaOH) and\n\nannealing temperature. They observed that for high concentrations of NaOH and higher\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n29\n\nannealing temperatures the crystallite size was higher. The results obtained are\n\nsummarised in Table 3.2.\n\nTable 3.2 NaOH concentration and annealing temperature effect on crystallite size and saturation\n\nmagnetization of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.\n\nNaOH conc.

The\n\nproducts annealed above 600 \u00b0C showed that most particles have sizes larger than 100\n\nnm, but they were polydisperse.\n\n? Thermal decomposition\n\nThermal decomposition is the decomposition of organometallic compounds in high-\n\nboiling organic solvents containing stabilizing surfactants. The typical surfactants are\n\nfatty acids [61, 62] or PVP [63]. The size and morphology of magnetic nanoparticles\n\ncould be controlled by the ratio of the starting reagents including organometallic\n\ncompounds, surfactant, and solvent. An annealing step is needed in order to obtain\n\ncrystalline material. Cabrera et al. [61] synthesized cubic nanoparticles of MFe2O4 (M=\n\nFe, Co and Mn) by thermal decomposition of Fe(III), Co(II) and Mn(II) oleates. The\n\nauthors observed that the size of ferrite nanoparticles could be controlled by varying the\n\namount of metal-oleate complex in the reaction mixture. The particle size was\n\nproportional to the concentration of metal-oleate. For the case of CFO, the morphology of\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n30\n\nthe particles changed from cubic to spherical with modification of Co-oleate\n\nconcentration. This fact is related with the growth rates. Faster growth rates lead to\n\nspherical Co ferrite nanoparticles. Therefore, high concentration of metal cations is\n\nresponsible for faster growth rates. Cobalt ferrite with mean size 12 nm shows 54 emu/g\n\nof saturation magnetization at 5 K and 50 emu/g at 290 K.\n\n? Micro-emulsion\nA micro-emulsion is an isotropic and thermodynamically stable single phase\n\nformed by at least three components; two of them are non-miscible, and the third one,\n\ncalled surfactant, is characterized by amphiphilic properties [65]. Depending on the\n\nproportion of suitable components and on the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance value of the\n\nsurfactant used, it occurs the formation of microdroplets can be in the form of oil in water\n\n(O/W) or micro-emulsion of water in oil (W/O). In W/O microemulsions, the aqueous\n\nphase is dispersed as microdroplets surrounded by a monolayer of surfactant molecules\n\n[67]. The size of the micelle is determined by the molar ratio of water to surfactant [66].\n\nBy mixing two identical water-in-oil microemulsions containing the desired reactants, the\n\nmicrodroplets will continuously collide, coalesce and break again, and finally a\n\nprecipitate is formed in the micelles. By the addition of solvent, such as acetone or\n\nethanol, to the microemulsions, the precipitate can be extracted by filtering or\n\ncentrifuging the mixture. The micro-emulsion can be named as a nanoreactor for the\n\nformation of nanoparticles.\n\nLiu et al. [68] prepared CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by micro-emulsion method. The size\n\nof nanoparticles (from 4nm to 10nm) was controlled by concentration of the reagents. The\n\nsaturation magnetization increased from 15 to 50 emu/g with particle size increase.\n\n? Hydrothermal synthesis\n\nHydrothermal processing can be defined as a heterogeneous reaction on the\n\npresence of aqueous solvents under high pressure and temperature conditions that allow\n\nthe dissolution and recrystallization of materials that are relatively insoluble under\n\nordinary conditions [69]. When a non-aqueous solvent is used, the process is so-called\n\nsolvothermal synthesis [70, 71]. During the hydrothermal treatment metallic cations\n\ninitially precipitate in the form of hydroxides. Over time, these hydroxides undergo\n\ndehydration to form the metal oxide crystal structures [72].\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n31\n\nThis method is a good alternative to organic decomposition processes from the\n\nenvironment viewpoint. Moreover, hydrothermal synthesis does not need special water-\n\nand oxygen-free procedures and annealing step to crystalize the products.\n\nGoh et al. [73] prepared CoFe2O4 by hydrothermal synthesis with sizes between\n\n15.6 and 33.1 nm. The size of nanoparticles was controlled by the temperature of\n\nhydrothermal reaction. The saturation magnetization increase with particle size and the\n\nhighest value achieved was 73.4 emu/g.\n\nThe advantages and drawbacks of each method discussed above are summarised in\n\nTable 3.3. The choice of the appropriate method to synthesize nanoparticles should be\n\ndone as a function of the final application. In terms of simplicity and environmental\n\nfriendly methodologies, co-precipitation and hydrothermal synthesis are the preferred\n\nroutes because only need water-based solutions to prepare magnetic nanoparticles.  The\n\ndifferences between these two methods are mainly the need of an annealing step in the\n\ncase of co-precipitation. Thermal decomposition and micro-emulsion methods involve the\n\nuse of organic compounds and the processes are more complex to settle than the co-\n\nprecipitation and hydrothermal synthesis. When the shape control is a required aim, the\n\nbest methods are thermal decomposition and hydrothermal synthesis. Additives or\n\ndifferent precursor nature could easily control the shape of nanoparticles by favouring the\n\ngrowth in some crystallographic direction [63, 74, 75]. The shape could also be controlled\n\non microemulsion synthesis however this method requires a large amount of solvent [76].\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n32\n\nTable 3.3 Summary comparison of possible methods to synthesize CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.\n\nMethod\nSynthesis Annealing Solvent\n\nSize distribution/ Shape\n\ncontrol\nYield References\n\nCo-Precipitation Simple, ambient conditions Needed Water Relatively narrow/ Not good High [59, 77]\n\nThermal decomposition Complicated, inert atmosphere Needed Organic\n\ncompound\n\nVery narrow/ Very good High [61]\n\nMicro-emulsion Complicated, ambient\n\nconditions\n\nNeeded Organic\n\ncompound\n\nRelatively narrow/ Good Low [68]\n\nHydrothermal synthesis Simple, autogeneous pressure Not needed Water Very narrow/ Very good Medium [73]\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n33\n\nCo-precipitation and thermal decomposition are the best studied to prepare\n\nmagnetic nanoparticles. Although, due to a high interest in use of simple and\n\nenvironmental friendly methods, hydrothermal synthesis has been extensively applied the\n\nlast years. The following paragraphs are devoted to the review of the hydrothermal\n\nsynthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.\n\nOnly a few papers could be found in Web of Knowledge\u00ae about hydrothermal\n\nsynthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. The first work reported was in 2003 by Cote et al.\n\n[72] which prepared CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by continuous hydrothermal synthesis.\n\nImportant conclusions were achieved. It was found that it is necessary to control pH and\n\ntemperature in order to prevent premature precipitation of iron in the reactor. The\n\npresence of a second metal cation was beneficial in controlling the particle formation\n\nprocess probably by preventing the formation of complex hydroxides when the base was\n\nadded to the cold metal salt solution. In this work two variations of the continuous\n\nhydrothermal synthesis were examined \u2013 cold mixing and hot mixing [72]. The cold\n\nmixing experiment produced a material with less impurities than the hot mixing one.\n\nFurthermore, a mechanism of particle formation was postulated involving the\n\nprecipitation of metal hydroxides at ambient conditions, dissolution of the hydroxides as\n\ntemperature was increased followed by rapid precipitation of metal oxides at elevated\n\ntemperatures. When the reactants were mixed at elevated temperatures, the mechanism\n\nwas simply precipitation of metal oxides due to the addition of the hot hydroxide solution.\n\nIn both mechanisms, very fine particles of CoFe2O4 were produced.\n\nIn 2004, the effect of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as surfactant in\n\nhydrothermal synthesis was studied by Ji et al. [78]. The products prepared without\n\nCTAB showed an irregular shape and wide size distribution. However, the morphology\n\nchanged drastically when the surfactant was applied. Nanorods were formed with the\n\naverage size of 120 nm in length and 25 nm in diameter (Figure 3.7A). CTAB is an ionic\n\ncompound, which is ionized completely in water. The resultant CTA+ has a positively\n\ncharged tetrahedron with a long hydrophobic tail, while the growth unit for CoFe2O4\ncrystal is considered to be Co\u2013Fe\u2013OH-. Therefore, ion pairs between CTA+ and Co\u2013Fe\u2013\n\nOH- could be formed due to electrostatic interaction. In the crystallization process,\n\nsurfactant molecules may serve as a growth controller, as well as an agglomeration\n\ninhibitor, by forming a covering film on the newly formed CoFe2O4 crystal. The\n\nadsorption of species at the crystal surfaces strongly affects the growth rate and\n\norientation of the crystals. The surfactant molecules in the film tend to be perpendicular\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n34\n\nto the absorbed surface, and the growth units would tend to face-land onto the growing\n\ninterface. Since this kind of landing and dehydration will result in Co\u2013O\u2013Fe bonds, make\n\nthis landing mode is predominant in competition with other ones such as vertex- and\n\nedge-landing. CoFe2O4 crystal should grow preferentially and the dehydration steps are\n\nrepeated in the following procedures. In terms of magnetic properties, nanorods showed a\n\nvery low saturation magnetization (0.083 emu/g). The reason for this low magnetization\n\nwas not discussed. More works in hydrothermal synthesis assisted by different\n\nsurfactants, in order to change the morphology, were reported [74, 75, 79, 80].\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n35\n\nWithout surfactant With surfactant\n\nNot done up to now\n\nNot done up to now\n\nFigure 3.7 Different morphologies of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles prepared by surfactant-assisted\n\nhydrothermal synthesis. A= Ref. [78], B= Ref. [74], C= Ref. [79], D= Ref. [75] and E= Ref. [80].\n\nChen et al. [79] synthesized CoFe2O4 nanoparticles by using polyethylene glycol\n\n(PEG) as surfactant. The shape of particles changed from quasi-spherical to\n\nparallelogram, Figure 3.7C. The addition of PEG improved the crystallite size from 24 to\n\n35 nm. In terms of magnetic properties, the saturation magnetization increased from 29.3\n\nto 36.5 emu/g with PEG addition. Similarly to the work reported by Chen et al., Zhang et\n\nal. [80] studied the effect of different amounts of trisodium citrate (CA) dihydrate\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n36\n\n(Na3CA.2H2O), Figure 3.7E. The authors observed that the lattice constant, crystallite\n\nsize, shape and magnetic properties could be tuned by changing the masses of\n\nNa3CA.2H2O. The lattice constant increased with Na3CA.2H2O mass increase. However,\n\nthe average size of particles increased for masses of surfactant below 1g and decreased\n\nfor larger amounts of surfactant. When a large amount of additive was used, the Co2+ and\n\nFe3+ had finite masses and reacted totally; the extra molecules of additive had no\n\ncontribution to the increase of lattice constant. The magnetic properties of the products\n\nare related with lattice constant, size and shape of particles due to the addition of\n\nNa3CA.2H2O.\n\nIn addition to the surfactant effect on hydrothermal synthesis, other studies were\n\ncarried out in order to understand the mechanism of the method. Goh et al. [73] studied\n\nthe hydrothermal synthesis temperature effect on particle size and shape. It was observed\n\nthat the shape of CoFe2O4 nanocrystals was transformed from spherical into rod and the\n\ncrystallite size increased by increasing the hydrothermal temperature, Table 3.4. The\n\nlarger sizes result from coalescence and Ostwald ripening at high temperatures.\n\nTable 3.4 Effect of hydrothermal temperature on average crystallite size and magnetic properties,\n\nof CoFe2O4 adapted from Ref.

[58] studied the effect of pH of solution and the coexisting cations. It\n\nwas found that pure CoFe2O4 could be synthesized at pH 12 and above. To evaluate the\n\neffect of coexisting cations, the authors used LiOH, NaOH and KOH solutions. It was\n\nobserved that the final products did not contain Na or K, which indicates that these\n\ncations did not take part in the reaction. In the presence of NaOH and KOH aqueous\n\nsolutions the only product was CoFe2O4. However, the product synthesized in LiOH\n\nsolution did not match with CoFe2O4. The researchers suggested that Li could form a\n\nspinel compound with formula Li2xCo1-xFe2O4.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n37\n\nLi et al. [81] carried out the magnetic measurements at different temperatures: 10\n\nand 300 K. CFO nanoparticles exhibited high coercive field at 10K and performed\n\nsuperparamagnetism at room temperature (characterized by very low coercive field),\n\nFigure 3.8.\n\nFigure 3.8 Magnetic measurements carried out at room temperature (a) and 10 K (b), adapted\n\nfrom Ref. [81].\n\nFrom this hydrothermal synthesis review, it was conclude that the final product\n\nproperties (size, shape and magnetic properties) could be easily controlled by this method.\n\n3.4. Functionalization - Electrophoretic deposition\n\nElectrophoretic deposition (EPD) has attracted special attention of the scientific\n\ncommunity over the last decade due to its high versatility for application for the\n\npreparation of thick or thin films of different materials, substrates and combinations of\n\nmaterials, its cost-effectiveness and the use of simple equipment [82-85]. It offers easy\n\ncontrol of thickness and morphology of the deposited product by controlling the\n\nprocessing parameters like voltage and time [85-89]. For all the stated reasons, it is a\n\ngood candidate for the functionalization of the porous thin films matrices with cobalt\n\nferrite nanoparticles.\n\n3.4.1. Introduction\n\nThe electrophoresis phenomenon was discovered in 1808 by a Russian physicist F.\n\nF. Ruess, who observed movement of clay particles, suspended in water, due to an\n\ninduced electric field [90]. The basic phenomenon involved in EPD for the fabrication of\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n38\n\nceramics was first researched by Hamaker in 1940 [91]. On the following years and up to\n\nthe early 90\u2019s, EPD was mainly researched for the processing of traditional ceramics or\n\ncoatings of metal components and very limited work was carried out on the EPD of\n\nmaterials engineering [84]. More recently, it the last two decades the interest in\n\nelectrophoretic deposition increased incredibly, and new applications of advanced\n\nmaterials have been discovered, denoted by the existence of more than a thousand\n\narticles, patents and four conferences about EPD.\n\nNowadays, EPD has been studied for several of novel applications like anti-oxidant\n\nceramic coatings, micro moulds, fabrication of functional films for advanced\n\nmicroelectronic devices, monolayers of nanoparticles or bioactive coatings for medical\n\nimplants [82, 83, 86-89, 92-95].\n\n3.4.2. Basic concepts\n\nElectrophoretic deposition is a colloidal process, which is used for coatings and\n\nfabrication of films. During the EPD process, charged powder particles, dispersed or\n\nsuspended in a liquid medium are attracted and deposited onto a conductive substrate of\n\nopposite charge on application of a DC electric field, Figure 3.9. Therefore, are three\n\nbasic steps in EPD: (1) formation of a stable suspension of the particles, (2)\n\nelectrophoretic migration of the particles to the deposition electrode, and (3) deposition of\n\nthe particles in the desired arrangement on the electrode surface [82].\n\nFigure 3.9 Two electrodes cell for electrophoretic deposition showing positively charged particles\n\nin suspension migrating towards the negative electrode [84].\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n39\n\nThere are two types of electrophoretic deposition depending on which electrode the\n\ndeposition occurs. When the particles are positively charged, the deposition happens on\n\nthe cathode - cathodic electrophoretic deposition [96]. If the particles are negatively\n\ncharged, the deposition occurs on the anode and the process is called anodic\n\nelectrophoretic deposition, Figure 3.10.\n\nFigure 3.10 Schematic illustration of EPD process a) cathodic EPD and b) anodic EPD [90].\n\nDuring the EPD process, particles get charged and move towards the electrode,\n\ndepositing on the electrode. But, how do particles get charge? Four mechanisms of\n\ncharging the particles were suggested [97]:\n\n1. A selective adsorption of ions from the liquid onto the solid particle;\n\n2. Dissociation of ions from the solid phase into the liquid;\n\n3. Adsorption or orientation of dipolar molecules at the particles surface;\n\n4. Electron transfer between the solid and liquid phase due to different work\n\nfunction.\n\nIn case of ceramic particles the last mechanism is not applicable but the first two\n\ninvariably occur. The sign of the net charge on the particle will depend not only on\n\nwhether mechanism 1 or 2 is dominant. Also, a positively charged particle may even\n\nbehave like a negative one, which is attracted to a positive electrode, if an excess of\n\nnegative ions is attracted to the vicinity of the particles. So it\u2019s difficult to predict whether\n\na deposition will occur, if on positive or negative electrodes in an unknown system.\n\nThe electrical double layer is a very important concept for the surface chemistry of\n\nmaterials in colloidal science field, like as in EPD. It describes the variation of the electric\n\npotential near a surface, and has a large effect on the behavior of colloids. Development\n\nof a net charge at the particle surface affects the distribution of ions in the surrounding\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n40\n\ninterfacial region, resulting in an increased concentration of the counter ions close to the\n\nsurface. Apart from the surface charge of the particles, the electrical surrounding double\n\nlayer consists of two parts: an inner region called Stern layer, where the ions are strongly\n\nattracted to the particle surface and closely attached to it due to their electrostatic force\n\nand an outer region called Diffuse layer, where the ions are less firmly associated to the\n\nsurface and which contains free ions with a higher concentration of the counter ions,\n\nFigure 3.11. In the Diffuse layer is a boundary known as the slipping plane, in which the\n\nparticle acts as a single entity [90, 98].\n\nFigure 3.11 Schematic representation of the double layer surrounding a charged particle and\n\nevolution of the zeta potential from the surface potential [98].\n\nThe zeta potential is the potential difference between the stationary layer of each\n\ndispersed particle and liquid medium. It can be used to control the stability of the\n\ncolloidal suspensions by determining the intensity of repulsive interactions between the\n\nparticles. Higher values of zeta potential lead to more stable suspensions. Increasing the\n\nionic strength can significantly reduce the repulsive forces. The behaviour of particle\n\nseparations depends critically on the ionic strength. If the potential energy is high, it\n\noriginates strong repulsive forces producing a totally dispersed system [90].\n\nFurthermore, the zeta potential determines the direction and migration velocity of\n\nparticles during EPD, according to the negative or positive signal of the charge.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n41\n\n3.4.3. Mechanism of EPD process\n\nAlthough EPD has been studied over the last decades, the mechanism of the\n\ndeposition is not entirely clear. Different theories have been discussed for a possible\n\nmechanism.\n\nThe first attempt to explain the phenomenon of EPD was made in 1940 by Hamaker\n\net al. [99], who suggested that the EPD is mainly a mechanical problem, i.e., the\n\nformation of deposits by EPD is similar to the formation of sediment due to gravitation.\n\nThe authors noted that the role of the electric field is only to provide a force, which\n\npresses the particles and moves them towards the electrode.\n\nGrillon et al. [100] suggested that the charged particles would be neutralized upon\n\ncontact with the deposition electrode, becoming static to form a deposit and that the role\n\nof the electric field is only to push the charged particles to move towards the electrode.\n\nDue to a \"tip effect\", the first deposited particles, i.e. those in contact with the substrate,\n\nplay the role of poles attracting the other particles, Figure 3.12.\n\nFigure 3.12 Phenomenological model of the electrophoresis of coarse particles [100].\n\nAnother mechanism found in literature was the electrical double layer distortion and\n\nthinning mechanism proposed by Sarkar and Nicholson [101]. The authors proposed a\n\nmodel mainly based on distortion of double layer. When a positive charge particle and its\n\nshell are moving towards the cathode, the double layer is distorted becoming thinner\n\nahead and wide behind due to the electric field applied, Figure 3.13(a). The cations in the\n\nliquid also move to the cathode along with positively charged particles and the counter\n\nions behind of the double layer will tend to react with the cations in high concentration\n\naround them, Figure 3.13(b). This chemical reaction reduces the thickness of the double\n\nlayer and therefore decreases the zeta potential. When another particle with a thin double\n\nlayer is approaching, the two particles come close enough to interact through London Van\n\nder Walls attractive forces and coagulate, Figure 3.13(c).\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n42\n\nFigure 3.13 Schematic representation of the deposition mechanism due to electrical double layer\n\ndistortion and thinning [101].\n\n3.4.4. Kinetics of electrophoretic deposition\n\nIn order to control and manipulate electrophoretic deposition process according to\n\ndesired final product, the understanding of the kinetics of electrophoretic deposition is\n\nhighly important.\n\nHamaker [91] observed a linear dependence of the deposited weight or yield of the\n\nEPD with the amount of charge passed, and proposed that the amount deposited is\n\nproportional to the concentration of the suspension, time of deposition, surface area of\n\nelectrode and electric field showed in the following equation:\n\n=? Eq. 3.1\nwhere M stands for the deposited mass in time t(s), ? designates a coefficient which\n\nrepresents the fraction of particles deposited near the electrode, A represents the electrode\n\narea (m2), C is the particle concentration in the suspension (kg/m3), ? is the\n\nelectrophoretic mobility (m2/V.s) and E is the electric field (V/m).\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n43\n\n3.4.5. Parameters related with suspension\n\nConcerning the suspension properties to obtain a good deposit by electrophoretic\n\ndeposition, many key parameters must be considered, such as the physicochemical nature\n\nof both suspended particle and the liquid medium: particle size, dielectric constant of\n\nliquid, zeta potential and stability of suspension [102]. The effect of each parameter will\n\nbe discussed in the following subtopics.\n\n? Particle size\n\nNowadays, electrophoretic deposition is used from micron to nanoscale. For larger\n\nparticles, the main problem is that they tend to settle due to gravity forces. In this case,\n\nthe mobility of particles needs to be higher than the gravity force. It is difficult to get a\n\nuniform deposition with a sedimenting suspension of large particles because, will lead to\n\ngradient in deposition, i.e., thinner above and thicker deposit at the bottom in case of\n\ndeposition electrode is placed vertically. However, nanoparticles also show some\n\ndrawbacks due to their high tendency to agglomerate. The use of solvents and in some\n\ncases additives is necessary to prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles.\n\n? Dielectric constant of liquid\n\nThe behaviour of the dielectric constant of the suspension media was studied by\n\nPowers et al. [103]. The authors used different suspension media of ?-Al2O3 and found\n\nthat the deposition did not take place for solvents with dielectric constant below 12 and\n\nabove 25. For low dielectric constant, the deposition fails due to insufficient dissociative\n\npower of solvent. In case of high dielectric constant the high ionic concentration in the\n\nsuspension reduces the thickness of the double layer and consequently the electrophoretic\n\nmobility.\n\n? Zeta potential and stability of suspension\n\nAs mentioned before, the zeta potential is a key factor in the electrophoretic\n\nprocess. It determines the intensity of repulsive interaction between particles, the\n\ndirection (positive or negative) and migration velocity of particle during EPD. A high zeta\n\npotential will confer stability to the suspension and the dispersion will resist to\n\nagglomeration.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #3 | Strategy of this thesis\n\n44\n\n3.4.6. Parameters related to electrophoretic deposition process\n\nNot only the suspension properties lead to a good electrophoretic deposition but\n\nalso the parameters such as deposition time and applied voltage are very important.\n\n? Deposition time\nThe effect of deposition time was studied by A. Wu and P. Vilarinho [89]. The\n\nauthors observed that the deposition rate decreases for long times of deposition due to an\n\noverall electrical resistance of the film already deposited. So, short times of deposition\n\nfavour thick films, while long time deposition leads to decrease the rate due to the\n\nformation of an insulating layer on the electrode composed by the film itself.\n\n? Applied voltage\n\nBesides the studies on the effect of time deposition, A. Wu and P. Vilarinho also\n\nstudied the effect of applied voltage [89]. For a fixed time of 2.5 minutes, the thickness of\n\ndeposit increases linearly with the applied field. Both results at the time are in agreement\n\nwith the Eq. 3.1 discussed in Kinetics of EPD \u2013 Section 3.4.4.\n\n\n\nCarla F. Silva Multifunctional films from porous matrices\n\nExperimental\n\nProcedure\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental procedure\n\n47\n\n4. Experimental\tprocedure\n\nThe experimental procedure of this thesis is divided in 3 parts: i) preparation of\n\nporous ferroelectric thin films: ii) preparation of ferromagnetic nanoparticles and iii)\n\nfunctionalization of pores of the ferroelectric matrix with ferromagnetic nanoparticles by\n\nelectrophoretic deposition, Figure 4.1.\n\nFigure 4.1 Schematic of this work illustrating the functionalization of porous BaTiO3 matrix with\n\nCoFe2O4 nanoparticles by electrophoretic deposition.\n\n4.1. Porous ferroelectric films\n\nTo produce porous ferroelectric thin films the experimental procedure proposed by\n\nFerreira et al. [13] was adopted. It consists in the preparation of BaTiO3 sol-gel solution\n\nand then its deposition in conductive substrates by dip-coating combined with EISA\n\n(Evaporation Induced Self Assembly).\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure\n\n48\n\nIn order to form the pores in the films, template molecules are needed. Typical\n\ntemplates are surfactant molecules or amphiphilic block copolymers (ABCs), which\n\nconsist of a copolymer formed by blocks of polymers chemically different that are\n\ncovalently attached to each other. These polymers should be have different hydrophobic\n\ncharacter namely one should be very hydrophobic while the other should be hydrophilic.\n\nThey are mostly referred by the abbreviation of their segments and usually a b is put\n\nbetween them to indicate the block structure. For example, in this work, it is used PS-b-\n\nPEO for polystyrene-poly-(ethylene oxide), Figure 4.2.\n\nFigure 4.2 Structure of monomer of PS-b-PEO block copolymer, adapted from Ref. [104].\n\nBy dissolving the ABC in a liquid that is thermodynamically a good solvent for one\n\nof the blocks and a precipitant for the other (called a \u201cselective solvent\u201d), micelles are\n\nformed above the critical micelle concentration (CMC). The inorganic precursors typical\n\ncondense around those micelles arrays to form the porous films. In this work the PS is\n\nsoluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF), while the PEO is solubilized by the ethanol.\n\nIn this work, it was used as block co-polymer polystyrene-poly-(ethylene oxide)\n\nwith two different average molecular weight (Mw): a) PS-b-PEO 40000-53000 g mol-1\n\nand b) 58600-71000 g mol-1.\n\n4.1.1. Sol-gel method\n\nFor preparation of sol-gel solution, three initial solutions were prepared: A, B and\n\nC. Table 4.1 shows the chemical composition of these starting solutions used to\n\nsynthesize BaTiO3 porous films.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental procedure\n\n49\n\nTable 4.1 Chemical composition of initial solutions used for preparation of BaTiO3 films.\n\nReagents Weight (g) Producer Purity\n\nSo\nlu\n\ntio\nn \n\nA Ps-b-PEO\n* Polymer source -\n\n(CH2)4O 0.930 Sigma-Aldrich ?99.5%\n\nCH3CH2OH 2.280 Panreac Absolute\nSo\n\nlu\ntio\n\nn \nB\n\nBa(OH)2.8H2O\n\nCH3COOH\n\n0.268\n\n1.717\n\nMerk\n\nSigma-Aldrich\n\n-\n\n?99.7%\n\nSo\nlu\n\ntio\nn \n\nC C5H8O2 0.100 Fluka 99.3%\n\nTi(OBu)4 0.480 Merk -\n\nCH3CH2OH 0.500 Panreac Absolute\n\n* The used polymer weight depends of concentration. Low and high concentrations\ncorrespond to 0.083 g and 0.166 g, respectively.\n\nIn order to study the effect of molecular weight (Mw) of PS-b-PEO, two different\n\nMw were used: Mw = 40000-53000 g mol-1 and Mw=58600-71000 g mol-1. The\n\nmolecular weight is related with the number of monomers of polystyrene and\n\npolyethylene oxide (n and m index, respectively, displayed in Figure 4.2) present in a\n\nunique chain of polymer.\n\nThe solution containing the block polymer was heated to 70\u00baC for 10 minutes to\n\nallow the complete dissolution of polymer in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Then, 2.28g of\n\nethanol were added drop-by-drop under magnetic stirring at 25 \u00baC. The solution B, the\n\nbarium precursor was dissolved in acetic acid and heated to 70 \u00baC for 60 minutes to allow\n\nthe total dissolution of Ba(OH)2.8H2O. In third solution, acetylacetone was added to\n\ntitanium precursor and stirred for 45 minutes at room temperature and then ethanol was\n\nadded drop-by-drop. To achieve the final sol-gel solution, solutions A, B and C were\n\nmixed, at room temperature, in the following sequence: first solution C was added into\n\nsolution B drop-by-drop under stirring. After 15 minutes, the new solution (B+C) was\n\ndropped into solution A. The sol-gel solution was kept under stirring several minutes\n\nbefore dip-coating process.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure\n\n50\n\n4.1.2. Dip-coating and EISA\n\nThe films were deposited by dip-coating (Figure 4.3) with different values of\n\nwithdrawal rate (15.58, 29.58 and 96 mm/min) onto 10 \u00d7 25 mm sized slides of\n\nmultilayer (Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si) wafers from Ramtron. Before deposition the substrates were\n\ncleaned by ultrasonics agitation in ethanol and acetone, 5 minutes each one.\n\nFigure 4.3 Deposition of porous BaTiO3 film by dip-coating.\n\nThe solutions preparation and deposition was done at approximately 30% of relative\n\nhumidity and 25 \u00b0C. The dip-coater used is from KSV model DC/D/LM. After deposition,\n\nBaTiO3 films were treated in air up to 400 \u00b0C for 5 minutes in order to complete de\n\ninorganic condensation of the matrix and to decompose the organic parts of the precursors\n\nand copolymer template. Then, the films were annealed for 6 minutes at the desired\n\ntemperatures of crystallization. Above 700 \u00b0C the calcination time was 2 minutes in order\n\nto avoid the elimination of the porous by the high growth of BaTiO3 grains. The\n\nannealing temperatures were chosen according to the results from Differential Thermal\n\n(DTA) and Thermogravimetry (TGA) analyses.\n\nDue to the porosity and in order to avoid humidity and gases adsorption, the films\n\nwere involved in filter paper, placed in Schlenk and maintained under nitrogen\n\natmosphere until further characterization or functionalization, Figure 4.4.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental procedure\n\n51\n\nFigure 4.4 Schlenk with porous BaTiO3 thin films inside.\n\n4.2. Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles \u2013 Hydrothermal synthesis\n\nThe CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis, a water-\n\nbased environmental-friendly process. In typical synthesis, 0.1 mol of Co2+ : 0.2 mol of\n\nFe3+ : 0.01 mol of NaOH : 0.55 mol of H2O. The starting precursors, Co(NO3)2.6H2O\n\n(Sigma-Aldrich, purity 98%) and Fe(NO3)3.9H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, purity ? 98%) with\n\nCo:Fe ratio=1:2 were dissolved, under magnetic stirring, into distilled water to achieve\n\nmixed aqueous solutions. The pH in this step was between 1 and 2 (the equipment used\n\nfor pH measurements was WTW model pH330i). In some cases, to study the effect of the\n\nadditive in final properties of CoFe2O4, different concentrations of PVP (Aldrich, Mw =\n\n1300000 gmol-1) were added to the reaction mixture. Two aqueous solutions of PVP were\n\nprepared with the concentration of 5% (%w/v) and 10% (%w/v). In this case, 2 mL of\n\nthese mother solutions were added by substitution of the same volume of H2O \u2013\n\ncorresponding to PVP5 (solution of 5% of PVP) and PVP10 (solution of 10% of PVP).\n\nAfter 15 minutes the precipitating agent, NaOH (eka), was added drop-by-drop under\n\nstirring and a dark brown solution was achieved with at pH=13. Different concentrations\n\nof NaOH were used in order to study the effect on the morphology of the nanoparticles.\n\nThe solution was kept under stirring for one hour. Then, it was transferred to a Teflon-\n\nlined stainless steel autoclave, Figure 4.5A.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure\n\n52\n\nFigure 4.5 (A) 30mL autoclave used for hydrothermal synthesis and (B) oven equipped with\n\nmechanical stirrer.\n\nThe autoclave was placed into an oven equipped with rotation system Figure 4.5B.\n\nThe rotation speed was the same for all syntheses, 35 RPM. Different temperatures and\n\ntimes of hydrothermal synthesis were used to study and optimize the process. According\n\nto the aim of this thesis, deposition of nanoparticles in the pores of BaTiO3 films, the\n\ncontrol of size and shape of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles is required. Initially the effect of the\n\nsynthesis temperature were studied. Then, the best temperature was used to study the time\n\neffect. In the end the additive effect, NaOH and metal ions concentrations were studied.\n\nAfter hydrothermal synthesis, the dark powders were collected from the bottom of Teflon\n\nvessel and were washed by ultracentrifugation with distilled water and ethanol. The\n\nultracentrifugation equipment used was Beckman model L8-70M. Initially the powder\n\nwas washed under 10.000 RPM but at this velocity the nanoparticles tend to agglomerate\n\ndue to high centrifugal forces. In order to avoid this problem, a study was developed to\n\nachieve the best velocity to minimize the nanoparticles agglomeration. The ideal velocity\n\nwas 7.500 RPM. The drying step was made at room temperature. The final powders were\n\nstored in glass vials.\n\nA B\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental procedure\n\n53\n\n4.3. Films functionalization \u2013 Electrophoretic deposition\n\nThe functionalization step involved firstly optimization of electrophoretic\n\ndeposition, namely in terms of solvent to ensure monodispersion of nanoparticles.\n\nFive suspensions were prepared in a glass beaker with 0.2 mg mL-1 of CoFe2O4\nnanoparticles. Distilled water, ethanol (Panreac, purity P.A.), acetone (Carlo Erba, purity\n\nP.A.), n-hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, purity ? 99%) and n-butanol (Sigma, purity > 99%)\n\nwere tested. A further dispersion of the suspension was conducted by using ultrasonics\n\nagitation in equipment Bransonic (70 W and 42 kHz) for 1 hour and then 15 seconds in\n\nultrasonic sonar from Bandelin model Sonoplus HD 3100. The stability of the\n\nsuspensions was studied by two simple methods: by observation of the suspension colour\n\nover the time and by UV spectroscopy.\n\nFor the EPD optimization, bare substrates of 10 \u00d7 25 mm were used (the same as\n\nused for dip-coating of porous BaTiO3 thin films. In this step, studies on effect of applied\n\nvoltage and deposition time were carried out.\n\nFinished the EPD optimization, the best parameters were chosen to functionalize\n\nporous BaTiO3 thin films, Figure 4.6.\n\nFigure 4.6 Schema of functionalization of porous thin films with ferromagnetic nanoparticles by\n\nEPD.\n\n+-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure\n\n54\n\n4.4. Characterization\n\n4.4.1 X-rays diffraction (XRD)\n\nX-ray diffraction was a very useful technique in this work, enabling a qualitative\n\nanalysis of the crystalline phases in the porous BaTiO3 thin films, CoFe2O4 nanoparticles\n\nand composite films. This technique is a versatile and non-destructive.\n\nBy exposing a crystalline sample to a X-ray beam, some of those X-rays are diffracted\n\naccording to a certain angle (2?) matching characteristic crystallographic directions of the\n\nmaterial as given by the \u201cBragg\u2019s law\u201d [105]:\n\n=2 sin Eq. 4.1\nwhere is the wavelength of X-rays, is the angle between the incident rays and crystal\n\nsurface, d is the spacing between layer of atoms.\n\nIn the present project, the X-rays diffractions were performed using Philips X-Pert\n\nMPD equipment with Cu-K? X-radiation and = 1.5406 \u00c5. The sweeping angles used\n\nfor identification of the crystalline phases present in BaTiO3 thin films were from 20 to\n\n60\u00b02? and for CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were 20 to 80\u00b02?, both with a step of 0.02\u00b02? at\n\nroom temperature. For phase identification through the X-ray diffraction peaks, an\n\nintegrated database of Powder Diffraction Files (PDF4+) from the International Centre of\n\nData Diffraction (ICDD) was used.\n\nThrough the broadening of the X-ray diffraction peaks, crystallite sizes of less than\n\n~0,1 ?m could be conveniently measured [106]. The crystallite size of CoFe2O4 was\n\ncalculated by Scherrer equation:\n\n= Eq. 4.2\nwhere ? is the breadth usually expressed as the full width at half maximum peak\n\n(FWHM), K is a constant to account for particle shapes (close to unity, usually 0.9 for\n\nspherical shapes), ? is the wavelength of the X-rays, L is the crystallite size and ? is the\n\ndiffraction angle. The broadening is also affected by instrumental factors. Such factors\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental procedure\n\n55\n\nhave to be subtracted to correctly calculate the crystallite size. To measure the\n\ninstrumental broadening a crystalline material in which the broadening is negligible can\n\nbe used. In this case, the instrumental broadening was determined with a crystalline\n\nlanthanum hexaboride (LaB6). The peaks used for crystallite size measurements were at\n\n2?=30.07 and 35.42\u00b0. In these cases, new X-rays diffractions were measured between 28\n\nand 38\u00b0 2? in order to obtain more defined peaks allowing a good crystallite size\n\nmeasurements.\n\n4.4.2 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\n\nScanning Electron Microscopy was used in this project to reveal the microstructure\n\nof porous BaTiO3 thin films and composite thin films. An electron gun generates a beam\n\nof electrons inside a vacuum column, which is then focused and driven to collide with a\n\ntarget, the sample. [107] An image is possible due to the electronic signal generated by\n\nthe low angle backscattered electrons, which are created by electron interactions with the\n\nmaterial surface [108].\n\nThe SEM equipment used was Hitachi\u00ae model SU-70. This microscopy has\n\nmagnifications from \u00d730 to \u00d7800.000 and acceleration voltage in range of 0.1 to 30 kV.\n\nThe sample holder has 5-axis motorized: displacement in X and Z-axis, shift in Y,\n\nrotation (360\u00b0) and tilt (-5 to 70\u00b0). The tilt is an important characteristic because it allows\n\nthe tilt movement in cross-section of Ramtron substrate and of porous BaTiO3 thin films\n\nallowing a good view and measurement of thickness of the films. The potential\n\nacceleration used was 7kV. This equipment is also equipped with microanalysis system\n\nfor energy dispersive spectrometry of X-rays/EDS from Bruker model Quantax 400.\n\nFor samples preparation, the porous BaTiO3 thin films and composite thin films\n\nwere glued in typical SEM sample-holder with carbon tape. This preparation method\n\nallows the reutilization of the films for other characterization techniques or future\n\nfunctionalization.\n\n4.4.3 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)\n\nTransmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) has the same operation principle of\n\nSEM, but in this case the electrons are accelerated at a much higher potential to pass\n\nthrough the sample towards the detector below it. The electrons, passing through the\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure\n\n56\n\nsample, which has to be very thin to allow it, are either absorbed or dispersed changing\n\ntheir directions. This dispersion is influenced by the atomic arrangement of the material.\n\nAfterwards, they are focused again, amplified and projected in a fluorescent screen or in a\n\nmonitor. This technique allows observing the CoFe2O4 shape and size. The average size\n\nof nanoparticles was determined by measuring 150 particles of each sample assisted by\n\nsoftware ImageJ version 1.46r. The size distributions were determined by Gaussian curve.\n\nTEM was done in Hitachi\u00ae model H9000 with an acceleration potential of 300 kV.\n\nThe CoFe2O4 nanopowders were suspended in n-hexane (Sigma-Aldrich, purity ? 99%).\n\nThe powder was added slowly into n-hexane under ultrasonics agitation and kept for 1\n\nhour. Then, a droplet of the suspension was deposited in a holey carbon micrometric\n\ncopper grid from Agar Scientific\u00ae.\n\n4.4.4 Differential Thermal and Thermogravimetric Analysis\n\n(DTA/TGA)\n\nDifferential Thermal Analysis (DTA) is a technique that permits to know the\n\nthermal behaviour of a material and the transformations it goes through as temperature\n\nincreases. It is done by heating up the material, registering its temperature difference\n\nbetween material and an inert one (standard sample, normally pure alumina), which is\n\nbeing heated simultaneously. The temperature difference (in \u00b5V) is then plotted against\n\nthe temperature of the furnace. Positive differences between them indicate exothermal\n\ntransformations, while negative ones denote endothermic phenomena.\n\nIt is usual to record the weight variation with temperature during DTA, with a\n\ntechnique called thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). This provides additional information\n\nabout the transformation that is occurring, by overlapping the weight loss curve (TGA) as\n\na function of temperature together with the thermal energy curve (DTA).\n\nThese techniques were used to evaluate the BaTiO3. The sol-gel solution was dried\n\nat 60\u00b0C for 48h and then milled in a mortar . The equipment used was Setaram model\n\nLabsys\u2122 TG-DSC16. The analyses were done by heating the powder from room\n\ntemperature to 800\u00b0C at rate of 10\u00b0C/min under flowing air.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental procedure\n\n57\n\n4.4.5 Specific Surface Area (ABET) and Porosity Measurements\n\nobtained from the 77 K N2 Isotherms\n\nAdsorption measurement based on the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) isotherm is\n\nthe most widely used for the determination of the specific surface area of a powder or\n\nporous materials [109].\n\nThis measurement is done using N2 adsorption at 77 K, by putting a solid material\n\nof a known mass in contact with a known volume of gas, it adsorbs creating a decrease in\n\nthe pressure, from which the amount of adsorbed gas can be calculated. From these\n\nmeasurements a plot of the amount of gas adsorbed versus the relative pressure (P/P0, P0\nbeing the saturation vapour pressure of the adsorption gas used) is represented, which is\n\ncalled the adsorption isotherm. According to IUPAC 1985, the shapes of adsorption\n\nisotherms are classified into six groups. Type I isotherm is given by a microporous solid\n\nhaving a relatively small external surface. In contrast, type II isotherm represents\n\nunrestricted mono/multilayer adsorption on a non-porous or macroporous adsorbent. Type\n\nIV isotherm shows a characteristic hysteresis loop and the limiting uptake at high P/P0:\n\nthese features are associated with capillary condensation taking place in mesopores. Type\n\nVI represents stepwise multilayer adsorption on a uniform non-porous surface. Type III\n\nand V are associated with weak adsorbent - adsorbate interactions. The BET equation that\n\ncan be applied to the isotherm curve, which is only valid for lower values of p/p0 and is\n\nused in this form [110]:\n\n( ) = + Eq. 4.3\nwhere V is the volume of gas adsorbed, Vm is the monolayer volume and C is a constant.\n\nBy this procedure, the Vm can be calculated (from the slope and the intercept) and applied\n\nin Eq. 4.4 to calculate the surface area [110]:\n\n= Eq. 4.4\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure\n\n58\n\nwhere ABET is the surface area, NA is the Avogadro number, ? is the area of an adsorbed\n\ngas molecule and V0 is the volume of 1 mol of gas at STP (Standard Temperature and\n\nPressure).\n\nThe equipment used was Micromeritics\u00ae - Gemini 2370 V5. N2 gas was used as the\n\nadsorption gas and liquid N2 to cool down the samples. The samples were degassed at\n\n200?C overnight. These measurements allowed the determination of specific surface area\n\nof CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.\n\n4.4.6 Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM)\n\nScanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) has been a fundamental tool in high resolution\n\ncharacterization of metals, semiconductors, dielectrics, polymers and biomolecules.\n\nPiezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM), the most popular technique of ferroelectrics\n\ncharacterization via SPM, allows a nondestructive visualization of domain structures in\n\nthin films at the nanoscale [111].\n\nPFM technique is based on the detection of local piezoelectric deformation of the\n\nferroelectric film, which is induced by the application of an external AC voltage\n\n(V=V0.cos?t, where V0 is the vibration amplitude and ? the frequency) via a conducting\n\ncantilever tip. A standard lock-in technique is used by measuring the vertical mechanical\n\ndisplacement of the cantilever tip, as seen in Figure 4.7, which could be expressed as\n\n?Z=dvV0cos(?t+?), where dv is the effective piezoelectric constant and ? the phase\n\ndifference between the applied voltage V and the piezoresponse, therefore indicator of the\n\npolarization direction.\n\nFigure 4.7 Schematic illustration of vertical PFM signal detection, adapted from Ref. [111].\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental procedure\n\n59\n\nHowever, apparent electrostatic components result in high complexity of\n\npiezoresponse detection in thin films. In addition, the presence of porosity  (necessary for\n\nthe subsequent functionalization) in combination with the low thickness (<200 nm) is\n\nresponsible for making very difficult the process of characterization. The main reasons\n\nfor the absence of publications in literature concerning the porous thin film piezoresponse\n\ncharacterization (with the exception of P. Ferreira et al. 2012 [13]) are: low quantity of\n\ndeposited matter, inhomogeneity and preferential orientation of organized domains\n\nprovoked by the substrate compliance interactions and unidirectional contraction of the\n\ndomains due to the required thermal treatment [46].\n\nPiezoelectric force microscopy (PFM) analyses were carried out in a modified\n\natomic force microscope in PFM mode Nanoscope III, Digital Instruments, using silicon-\n\nSPM sensor with Al coating tips (NANOSENSORSTM model PPP-NCHR-20, l = 125 ?m,\n\nresonant frequency of 204 \u2013 497 kHz, force constant of 10 - 130 N/m). The topographic\n\nimages of the film surface were taken simultaneously with the domain images and were\n\ncollected in non-contact mode.\n\n4.4.7 Superconductor Quantum Interference Device (SQUID)\n\nThe superconductor quantum interference device (SQUID) was used to measure the\n\nmagnetic properties of the CoFe2O4 nanoparticles. In a SQUID magnetometer, the sample\n\nmoved through the external magnetic field. A pickup coil is linked to a superconducting\n\nloop with parallel Josephson junctions (Figure 4.8). A magnetic flux from the moving\n\nsample interrupts the superconducting loop. An applied bias current establishes the\n\nsuperconducting loop and indicates the magnetism of the sample [112].\n\nFigure 4.8 Schematic illustration of the superconducting loop with parallel Josephson junctions,\n\n[113].\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #4 | Experimental Procedure\n\n60\n\nThe measurements were performed by varying the magnetic field at constant\n\ntemperature (typically 10 K, but the same experience was made for other fixed\n\ntemperature from 10 to 300 K) and by fixing the magnetic field (10 Oe) and changing\n\ntemperature from 0 to 400 K. The equipment used was Quantum Design \u2013 MPMS from\n\nCentro de F\u00edsica Mat\u00e9rica Condensada- Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias from University of\n\nLisbon.\n\n\n\nCarla F.

The parameters studied were: a) the effect\n\nof type of annealing (with or without ramp); b) the molecular weight (Mw) of the block\n\nco-polymer PS-b-PEO: Mw = 40000-53000 gmol-1 or 58600-71000 gmol-1; concentration\n\nof block co-polymer and the withdrawal speed during the deposition.

Effect of experimental parameters on porous\n\nmicrostructures of thin films\n\n? Effect of type of annealing\n\nIn order to study the effect of the type of annealing, firstly, DTA/TGA\n\nmeasurements (Figure 5.1) were done to know the temperature of BaTiO3 phase\n\ncrystallization and decomposition of organic content of the films.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n64\n\nFigure 5.1 Differential thermal (DTA) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) of BaTiO3 dried\n\nsol-gel solution illustrating the pyrolysis of co-polymer and other organic compounds up to 500\n\n\u00b0C and BaTiO3 crystallization above of 600\u00b0C.\n\nThe TGA curve (blue line) shows the weight loss during the heating. The major\n\nweight loss occurs up to 450 \u00baC. This weight loss corresponds to the decomposition of the\n\norganic components of precursors, solvents and pyrolysis of block co-polymer PS-b-PEO\n\n(creating the porosity in the BTO film). It should be noted that the block co-polymer\n\ndecomposes in two steps corresponding to the degradation of the two polymer blocks.\n\nAccording to literature [13], poly(ethylene oxide) decomposes around 200 \u00baC while\n\npolystyrene decomposes at ca. 280 \u00baC. Above of 450 \u00baC no other remarkable weight loss\n\nwas observed.\n\nHere two different types of annealing were studied: (1) 5 minutes at 400 \u00b0C\n\n(without ramp) and (2) ramp with heating rate 10 \u00b0C s-1 and plateau of 5 minutes at 400\n\n\u00b0C. It was observed that the films should not age on the substrate as damage of the\n\nmicrostructure may occur.\n\nIn Figure 5.2, it is shown the effect of calcination type (with or without ramp) for\n\nporous thin films prepared with the block co-polymer with both Mw (samples C1 and\n\nC8). It can be observed that the type of annealing does not affect the porous\n\nmicrostructure for both thin films prepared with the block co-polymer with different Mw\n\n(40-53 k or 58.6-73 k gmol-1). Both films present a porous microstructure free of cracks\n\nor other defects. Due to this observation, the following studies were only carried out with\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n65\n\nannealing for 5 minutes at 400 \u00baC because it is a quick and less energy consuming\n\nmethod.\n\nPS\n-b\n\n-P\nE\n\nO\nM\n\nw\n =\n\n40\n\u2013\n\n53\nk \n\ng \nm\n\nol\n-1\n\nPS\n-b\n\n-P\nE\n\nO\nM\n\nw\n =\n\n58\n.6\n\n\u2013\n71\n\nk \ng \n\nm\nol\n\n-1\n\nFigure 5.2 SEM micrographs of porous BaTiO3 thin films annealed with or without ramp.

Effect of polymer Mw\nIn order to study the effect of Mw of the block co-polymer on porous\n\nmicrostructure, different molecular weights were used: a) PS-b-PEO 40000-53000 gmol-1\n\nand b) 58600-71000 gmol-1.\n\nIn Figure 5.3 the effect of different Mw on porous microstructures can be clearly\n\nobserved. The polymer with Mw = 40-53 k gmol-1 produces bigger pores with non-\n\nuniform shape, while the polymer with Mw = 58.6-71 k gmol-1 produces smaller pores\n\nwith narrow pore size distribution and uniform shape. Furthermore, the porous thin films\n\nobtained with higher Mw showed a preferential organization in the microstructure, the\n\npores are well organized revealing hexagonal-like arrays (blue mark). This hexagonal-like\n\narrays were also observed in nanoperforated TiO2 layers [53] and porous TiO2 thin films\n\n[54].\n\nWithout ramp With ramp\n\nWithout ramp With ramp\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n66\n\nFigure 5.3 SEM micrographs of porous BaTiO3 thin films prepared with polymers with different\n\nMw annealed at 400\u00b0C. The polymer with Mw=58.6-71 k gmol-1 displays small size but with\n\nhexagonal arrangement.\n\nTable 5.2 shows the average of pores size and respective standard deviation (?) of\n\nthe films described above. The measurements were carried out using the computer\n\nsoftware ImageJ. 150 measurements were done for each sample in order to achieve a\n\ngood sampling. The calculations of average pore size and standard deviation were done\n\nusing the software Origin version 8.5. The porous thin films prepared with Mw = 40-53 k\n\ngmol-1 present average pore size of 60.7 nm with ? = 6.2 while the thin films prepared\n\nwith Mw = 58.6-71 k gmol-1 present lower average pore size, 28.8 nm, and ? = 2.6. This\n\nlow value of ? indicates a narrow distribution of pore size for the high molecular weight\n\nblock co-polymer.\n\nTable 5.2 Average pore size and respective ? for films prepared with PS-b-PEO of different Mw.\n\nMw (gmol-1) Pore size (nm) ?

Effect of bock co-polymer concentration\nTo study the effect of block co-polymer concentration, it was prepared films using\n\ndifferent concentrations of block co-polymer: a) low concentration (0.083 g) and b) high\n\nconcentration (0.166 g) (double of the first one). The studies were carried out for the two\n\nblock co-polymers described above.\n\nPs-b-PEO Mw= 58.6 \u2013 71 k g mol-1Ps-b-PEO Mw = 40 - 53 k g mol-1\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n67\n\nFigure 5.4 shows the comparison of microstructures obtained from different\n\nconcentrations of block co-polymer. It is clear that the films obtained from sol-gel\n\nsolutions with high concentration of block co-polymer display more connected nanopores\n\nforming elongated pores as observed inside of yellow marked zones. This fact occurs for\n\nboth block co-polymers, however in the film obtained from the PS-b-PEO Mw = 40-53 k\n\ngmol-1, the presence of interconnected pores is more pronounced than for the other one.\n\nPS\n-b\n\n-P\nE\n\nO\n M\n\nw\n  =\n\n  4\n0\n\n\u2013\n53\n\n k\n g\n\nm\nol\n\n-1\nPS\n\n-b\n-P\n\nE\nO\n\nM\nw\n\n =\n58\n\n.6\n\u2013\n\n71\nk\n\ngm\nol\n\n-1\n\nFigure 5.4 SEM micrographs of porous BaTiO3 thin films prepared with different concentrations\n\nof block copolymer (Mw=40-53 k and Mw=58.6-73 k gmol-1). Low concentration = 0.083 g, High\n\nconcentration = 0.166 g.\n\nThe formation of elongated micropores is due too a high density of pores obtained\n\non the samples prepared with high concentration of block co-polymer. In order to\n\ncompare the effect of block co-polymer concentration on pore density, for each film, the\n\nnumber of pores present in a square with a side of 500 nm was calculated by using\n\nImageJ software.

The pore walls are much thinner\n\nfor Mw = 58.6-71 k gmol-1 than for Mw = 40-53 k gmol-1.\n\nAs expected, high concentrations of block co-polymer produces more pores per unit\n\narea. To compare the effect of both Mw, the increase of density was calculated by\n\nfollowing Eq. 5.1:\n\n\u00d7100 Eq. 5.1\nwhere ?h is the pores density at high concentration of block co-polymer and ?l is the pores\n\ndensity of lower concentration of block co-polymer.\n\nThe Mw = 40 \u2013 53 k gmol-1 block co-polymer caused an increase of 27.4% on\n\ndensity while Mw = 58.6-71 k gmol-1 caused an increase of 28.8%. These two values of\n\nincrease can be considered similar to each other.\n\n? Effect of withdrawal speed on BaTiO3 thin films thickness\nIt is known from the literature review that the thickness of thin films prepared by\n\ndip-coating depends on withdrawal speed and annealing temperature [13, 54].\n\nIn this work the effect of the withdrawal speed on the thickness of BaTiO3 thin\n\nfilms was studied by using two different speeds: 15.58 and 96 mm min-1. SEM\n\nmicrographs (not shown) prove that the porosity was not influenced by withdrawal speed.\n\nIn Table 5.4, the film thickness is presented as a function of the withdrawal speed,\n\ndetermined from the SEM micrographs cross-sections, for each withdrawal speed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n69\n\nTable 5.4 Effect of withdrawal speed on porous thin films thickness*.\n\nWithdrawal speed (mm min-1) Annealing Temp.

Higher\n\nwithdrawal speed provokes slow evaporation of solvents inducing high thickness. In this\n\nstudy, it was observed that the film thickness depends on the block co-polymer\n\nconcentration. Samples C8 and C12 were deposited with the same withdrawal speed,\n\nhowever, the block co-polymer concentration in sol-gel solution is different. However, in\n\nthe case of C12 the high concentration of block co-polymer was used, resulting in a\n\nthicker film. This can be justified by an increase of viscosity of the sol-gel solution.\n\nSimilar observation was described by Faustini et al. [54], who reported that at high\n\nwithdrawal speeds the final thickness of TiO2 films is mainly dependent on the viscous\n\ndrag.\n\nAs an example, the cross-section of sample C30 is shown in Figure 5.5. The\n\ncomposition of Ramtron substrate is presented in the following section.\n\nFigure 5.5 Cross-section of sample C30 annealed at 400 \u00b0C.\n\nSubstrate\n\nBaTiO3\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n70\n\n? Evolution of porous thin film microstructure and morphology with\n\nannealing temperature\n\nLike discussed before in section 3.2 \u2013 Porous ferroelectric thin films, the thermal\n\ntreatment step is necessary after deposition. During this step as evidenced by the\n\nDTA/TGA measurements (Figure 5.1), the decomposition of the organic content of the\n\nfilms occurs first, followed by the crystallization through nucleation and growth of\n\nBaTiO3 crystallites.\n\nTo study the evolution of the microstructure of porous thin films and thickness with\n\nannealing temperature, the sample C8 was annealed at 3 different temperatures: 400 \u00b0C\n\nfor 5 minutes, 650 \u00b0C 6 minutes and 750 \u00b0C 2 minutes. At 750 \u00b0C the films were treated\n\nonly for 2 minutes to avoid degradation of the porosity due to particles growth. The\n\nthickness measurements were carried out on cross-section samples by SEM and are\n\nshown in Table 5.5. The thickness decreases with the annealing temperature due to the\n\ncrystallization of the porous BaTiO3 thin films.\n\nTable 5.5 Pore size and thickness measurements* of different temperatures annealed C8 films.\n\nAnnealing temperature (\u00baC) Pore size (nm) Thickness (nm)\n\n400 28.8 ~150\n\n650 18.6 ~110-120\n\n750 Not measured ~90-100\n\n*measured by ImageJ\n\n? Ramtron wafer characterization\n\nThe used substrate from Ramtron was characterized by XRD and cross-section in\n\nSEM because the producer does not give information about the composition of their\n\nmultilayer wafers. The composition and thickness of each layer was determined by SEM\n\nassisted by EDS analysis, Figure 5.6.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n71\n\nFigure 5.6 SEM micrographs of multilayer (Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si) Ramtron wafer cross-section\n\ndisplaying different layers without any thermal treatment.\n\nEDS spot analysis allowed to determine the composition of each layer of Ramtron\n\nwafer. The major difficulty in this analysis was the determination of the TiO2 layer\n\nprobably due to ultra thin thickness. By SEM micrographs, even when assisted by EDS\n\nanalysis, is difficult to distinguish the TiO2 layer. The TiO2 layer should be located\n\nbetween platinum (Pt) and silica (SiO2) layers (please see on the left micrograph of Figure\n\n5.6) in order to ensure the adhesion of the Pt. The thickness of platinum layer was easily\n\ndetermined. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the boundary between TiO2 and SiO2\nlayers, these two layers were measured together as having approximately 450 nm, Table\n\n5.6. Probably, the TiO2 layer is less than 100 nm of thickness.\n\nTable 5.6 Composition and layer thickness of Ramtron wafers determined by SEM/EDS.\n\nComposition Thickness (nm)\n\nPt 150\n\nTiO2 + SiO2 450\n\nSi Not measured\n\nTo support the results of SEM/EDS, XRD analyses were carried out.

The reflection peaks observed around 2 ? = 55 \u00b0 are attributed to substrate and can\n\nbe related with forbidden peaks of Si.\n\nFigure 5.8 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of sample C8 annealed at different\n\ntemperatures: 650, 700 and 750\u00b0C.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n73\n\nFigure 5.8 X-rays diffraction patterns of porous BaTiO3 thin films annealed at different\n\ntemperatures (650, 700 and 750\u00b0C).\n\nThe X-ray patterns confirmed the formation of tetragonal BaTiO3 (for comparison,\n\nthe reflections corresponding to BaTiO3 tetragonal phase with space group P4mm\n\naccording to the JCPDS database card no. 04-012-8129 are shown as solid orange lines)\n\nfor temperatures above of 650\u00b0C. For higher temperatures BaTiO3 becomes more\n\ncrystalline. No other phases of BaTiO3 or other compounds were detected indicating the\n\npurity of tetragonal BaTiO3 phase. The peaks identified with an S were indexed to\n\nsubstrate by comparing this XRD patterns with the patterns of Figure 5.7.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n74\n\n5.1.2. Piezoresponse studies\n\nIn Table 5.7 and Table 5.8 are displayed the results of the Piezoresponce Force\n\nMicroscopy study for different samples.\n\nIn the topography images, the dark regions correspond to larger depths, whereas the\n\nlighter ones represent the ones closer to the surface. Thus, the topography image is a\n\nrepresentation of the film surface and, as a first approximation, of the apparent porosity.\n\nIn the piezoresponse images, the dark regions correspond to ferroelectric domains\n\noriented towards the substrate and the lighter ones towards the surface. The dark regions\n\nthat reveal large pores in the topography image continue to appear in the PFM image and\n\nthey do not correspond to piezoresponse. However, the appearance of different domains\n\nin the PFM image does not necessarily imply the existence of polarization, since a very\n\ndeep region (or else high) can present dark (light) domains in the PFM image.\n\nConsequently, a uniform region is preferred for better results. However, such requirement\n\nis difficult to be reached due to the thin porous films\u2019 limitations discussed above. As a\n\nresult, lower piezoresponse signal is observed, accompanied by high noise.\n\nIn Table 5.7 the evolution of the ferroelectric domains with increasing applied\n\nvoltage is presented for the case of sample C1, with a scanning size of 7 ?m. By the\n\napplication of 10 V we can observe the appearance of a few ferroelectric domains with\n\nopposite orientation. Increasing voltage results in increased contrast between the already\n\nexistent domains. However, apart from the expected low piezoresponse signal, high noise\n\n- clearly observed when no voltage is applied to the sample - weakens even more the\n\ncontrast between the domains. Finally, due to the high roughness of the surface there is an\n\nevident deformation of the grain morphology, as observed by the topography image. Such\n\neffects could be explained by an abrupt bend of the cantilever tip when in contact with the\n\nisland-like surface, which provokes very dark regions right after the high ones. An\n\napparent wear of the tip due to this violent interaction results in misrepresentation of the\n\nrealistic shape of the grains, conferring them an elliptical geometry.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n75\n\nTable 5.7 Topography and piezoresponse images of sample C1 (low concentration of block co-\n\npolymer Mw = 40 \u2013 53 k gmol-1, withdrawal speed = 15.58 mm s-1) for 0, 10, 15 and 20V applied\n\nvoltage.\n\nVoltage Topography Piezoresponse\n\n0 V\n\n10 V\n\n15 V\n\n20 V\n\n938.51 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n1.79 V\n\n0.00 V\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n90.90 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n1.77 V\n\n0.00 V\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n93.63 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n1.84 V\n\n0.00 V\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n95.27 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n1.82 V\n\n0.00 V\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n76\n\nIn Table 5.8 are presented the topography and piezoresponse characterization of\n\nsamples C1, C3, C8, C12 and C30 for different scanning sizes and applied voltage. The\n\nfourth column corresponds to the topography image and the last to the piezoresponse\n\nimage. The most interesting comparisons to be made are those for varying thickness,\n\nblock co-polymer Mw and polymer concentration.\n\nFor the study of thickness effect to piezoresponse, taking into account that the\n\nthickness relation between samples was C3 &lt;C1 = C12 = C8 &lt;C30, two groups could be\n\nchosen, keeping in each one the concentration and type of polymer constant, but varying\n\nwithdrawal velocity during dip-coating: C1-C3 and C8-C30. Sample C3 corresponds to a\n\nhigher deposition velocity than that of C1, therefore being the thinnest film. A higher\n\ncontrast between the ferroelectric domains is apparent on the C1 piezoresponse image,\n\naccompanied by an enhanced definition. Such a result was expected, since increased\n\nthickness is related to increased quantity of deposited matter, therefore enhanced\n\naccumulation of dipole components, which yields higher polarization. The second group\n\ndoes not follow the same behavior, probably due to the combination of the problems\n\nmentioned above.\n\nThe use of high block co-polymer Mw results in smaller pores in the ferroelectric\n\nmatrix. A representative case for this kind of study is between C8 and C1 samples, since\n\nthey have equivalent thickness, but C8 corresponds to the high block co-polymer Mw,\n\nthus smaller pores and enhanced polarization, which can be observed in the piezoresponse\n\nimage by a higher number of ferroelectric domains appearing in the case of C8.\n\nLastly, a higher polymer concentration turns the solution more viscous, which has a\n\nsevere effect on the homogeneity of the film thickness, as well as on the elongated pores\n\nas observed before in Figure 5.4. C12 sample was prepared with higher polymer\n\nconcentration and, apart from the expected weak piezoresponse, it was very difficult to\n\ncharacterize, due to its extremely rough surface, which was destroying the cantilever tip\n\nand providing falsified topography and piezoresponse images.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n77\n\nTable 5.8 Topography and piezoresponse images for the samples C1, C3, C8, C12 and C30.\n\nSample ScanningSize Voltage Topography Piezoresponse\n\nC1 7 ?m 10 V\n\nC3 7 ?m 10 V\n\nC8 5 ?m 10 V\n\nC12 3 ?m 10 V\n\nC30 5 ?m 20 V\n\n90.90 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n1.77 V\n\n0.00 V\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n80.59 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n2.29 V\n\n0.00 V\n\n1.4\u00b5m\n\n34.77 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n1.0\u00b5m\n\n1.79 V\n\n0.00 V\n\n1.0\u00b5m\n\n16.36 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n600nm\n\n1.87 V\n\n0.00 V\n\n600nm\n\n24.70 nm\n\n0.00 nm\n\n1.0\u00b5m\n\n1.01 V\n\n0.00 V\n\n1.0\u00b5m\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n78\n\n5.1.3 Summary\n\nPorous BaTiO3 thin films were successfully produced by dip-coating combined\n\nwith EISA. The effect on the microstructure of different parameters such as type of\n\nannealing, Mw of block co-polymer, concentration of block co-polymer and withdrawal\n\nspeed was studied. The type of annealing (with or without ramp) does not affect the\n\nmicrostructure. High block co-polymer Mw produces small pores and high concentration\n\nof polymer induces the formation of interconnected pores due to high density of pores.\n\nHigh annealing temperature reduces the pore size and the thickness of the film. High\n\nwithdrawal speeds form thick films. These porous structures are good candidates to\n\npyroelectric applications or future functionalization with nanoparticles composing a\n\nmultifunctional material.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n79\n\n5.2. CoFe2O4 nanoparticles\n\nIn this section, the results of CoFe2O4 synthesis are shown. The effect of different\n\nhydrothermal synthesis (HS) parameters such as: temperature and time of HS, additive\n\neffect, metal ions and base concentration was discussed.\n\n5.2.1. Synthesis temperature effect\n\nTo study the temperature effect, the syntheses were performed under the same\n\ncondition but at different temperatures: 100, 150, 200 and 230 \u00baC. The maximum\n\ntemperature is limited to 230 \u00b0C due to the limitations of properties of Teflon-lined\n\nautoclave. For all experiments, the autoclave was filled up to 50% of volume. In Figure\n\n5.9 are displayed the TEM micrographs of nanoparticles synthesized at 100 and 230 \u00b0C.\n\nFigure 5.9 TEM micrographs of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles obtained from hydrothermal synthesis at\n\n100 \u00b0C and 230 \u00b0C.\n\nFor low hydrothermal synthesis temperature, the nanoparticles present a fog-like\n\nshape, i.e. very agglomerated with none defined particle shape, due to the low\n\ncrystallinity of the material [58]. As the temperature increases nanoparticles tend to have\n\nrounded shape and some of them cubic shape. The average sizes of CFO nanoparticles\n\nobtained at 100 \u00b0C and 230 \u00b0C were about 12.9 nm and 16.1 nm, respectively, Table 5.9.\n\nThe sizes were measured in ImageJ software.\n\n100\u00b0C\n\nC\n\n100 \u00b0C 230 \u00b0C\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n80\n\nTable 5.9 Average particle size (DTEM), standard deviation (?) and specific surface area (ABET) of\n\nsamples prepared at different temperatures of HS.\n\nHS temperature (\u00baC) DTEM (nm) ?

The crystallite size increases from 15.6 to 19.1 nm\n\nwith the temperature increase from 100\u00b0C to 150\u00b0C. This increasing should be due to the\n\ncoalescence and Ostwald ripening as observed in previous studies [73]. For HS\n\ntemperatures above 150 \u00b0C, the crystallite size decreases. This fact could be associated to\n\na fast nucleation of the nanoparticles at higher synthesis temperature, with formation of a\n\nhuge number of nuclei and rapid decrease of the precursor concentration on the medium\n\npreventing crystallite growth [73].\n\nOn the left side of Figure 5.10 X-rays diffraction patterns of CoFe2O4 nanoparticle\n\nobtained from different HS temperatures are presented. Single crystalline cubic spinel\n\nphase is formed which is in accordance to JCPDS card no. 04-008-4497. The products\n\nprepared below 200 \u00b0C show lower crystallinity than the products obtained at high HS\n\ntemperatures.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n81\n\nFigure 5.10 X-ray diffraction patterns (left) and evolution of crystallite size (right) of CoFe2O4\nnanoparticles obtained at different temperatures of hydrothermal synthesis during 1h.\n\nThe Figure 5.11 presents the magnetic properties of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles as a\n\nfunction of HS temperature. All samples exhibit a typical ferromagnetic hysteresis loop.\n\nAs the synthesis temperature increases, the saturation magnetization increases from 53,7\n\nto 73,2 emu/g, as expected and in accordance to the high crystalline degree of these\n\nsamples. Similar study was carried out by Goh et al [73], where CFO nanoparticles with\n\nsizes between 15.6 and 33.1 nm present saturation magnetization of 56.8 and 73.2 emu/g\n\nrespectively.\n\nIt could be observed a drop on the magnetization at 10 K when the field is around 0\n\nOe. This effect was more pronounced for the sample prepared at 100 \u00baC and became less\n\nsignificant with the increase of the temperature of hydrothermal synthesis. According to\n\nthe literature this may occur due to the presence on the samples of soft magnetic species\n\nsuch as FeOOH that easily can be formed at low temperature in very small quantity [114].\n\nIn the left side of Figure 5.11 is presented the zero field cooling (ZFC) and filed\n\ncooling (FC) curves. The peak of these two curves is called blocking temperature. The\n\nblocking temperature (characterized by blocked magnetic moments) is between 350 and\n\n400 \u00b0C for all samples.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n82\n\nFigure 5.11 Hysteresis loops measured at 10 K (left side) and Magnetization versus Temperature\n\ncurves at constant magnetic field (10 Oe) (right side) of the nanoparticles prepared at different\n\ntemperatures of HS.\n\nIn Figure 5.12 is displayed the hysteresis loops measured at different temperatures\n\nfor the sample prepared at 200 \u00b0C 1h. The saturation magnetization (Ms) and the coercive\n\nfield (Hc) decrease with the increase of measurement temperature. At room temperature\n\nnanoparticles show a superparamagnetic behaviour, i.e., very low coercive field [81]. The\n\ncoercive field decreases from 11889 Oe (measured at 10 K) to 703 Oe (measured at 300\n\nK).

However, from the TEM micrograph of\n\nnanoparticles prepared at 230 \u00b0C for 24 h, it can be conclude that the size distribution is\n\nnot narrow due to the presence of small particles.

This iron oxide is antiferromagnetic [22]\n\nslightly present after 3 hours and clearly observed after 24 hours. The crystallite size\n\nmeasurements indicate that the crystallite size increases from 16.1 to 20.2 nm with HS\n\ntime increase. By comparing the average size of particles measured by TEM micrographs\n\nand crystallite sizes, it can be concluded that the nanoparticles are single-crystals.\n\nFigure 5.15 presents the magnetic properties of nanoparticles against the HS time.\n\nAll of the samples exhibit typical ferromagnetic hysteresis loop.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n86\n\nFigure 5.15 Hysteresis loops measured at 10 K for samples obtained at different times of\n\nhydrothermal synthesis (left) and Magnetization versus Temperature curve at constant magnetic\n\nfield (10 Oe) (right) CoFe2O4 nanoparticles prepared at 230 \u00b0C at different HS reaction times.\n\nNormally, the Ms increase with particle size [73]. However, it does not happen in\n\nthis study. Saturation magnetization decreases drastically from 73.2 to 8.04 emu/g when\n\nthe HS time increase from 1 to 24h. This decrease of saturation magnetization is clearly\n\ndue to the presence of the antiferromagnetic phase, ?-Fe2O3 detected by XRD.

PVP addition effect\n\nFor the aim of this work it was important to obtain monodispersed nanoparticles of\n\nCoFe2O4. For this, it was studied the effect of the addition of different concentrations of\n\nPVP as mentioned in section 4.2. PVP (Figure 5.16) is a water-soluble polymer resulting\n\nfrom the polymerization of the monomer N-vinyl pyrrolidone. It is a strong Lewis base\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n87\n\nand consequently can interact with other molecules by the formation of hydrogen bonds\n\nor can act as a proton acceptor. These chemical properties give PVP a strong affinity to\n\nbind ions surface, forming a layer, which theoretically avoids further aggregation, acting\n\nas growth inhibitor and dispersant [115]. PVP has been studied as a capping agent in the\n\npreparation of ferrites by thermal decomposition [63, 116, 117]. The authors proposed an\n\ninteraction between the metal ions and the nitrogen of PVP. PVP is commonly used to\n\nobtain ferrite fibers by electrospinning because as it interacts with the metal ions, it can\n\nallow the preparation of hollow fibers or it can ensure the preparation of individual fibers\n\n[118, 119].\n\nFigure 5.16 PVP monomer.\n\nFigure 5.17 shows the TEM micrographs of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles prepared\n\nwithout additive and with PVP10 at 200 \u00b0C by 1 h.\n\nFigure 5.17 TEM micrographs of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles synthesized without and with PVP, both\n\nprepared at 200\u00b0C 1h.\n\nPVP10No additive\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n88\n\nIn this study, the addition of PVP10 does not affect the shape of nanoparticles,\n\nhowever the particle size increases with PVP addition. The average particle size of\n\nsynthesis with different concentrations of PVP, measured in the TEM micrographs, are\n\nshown in Table 5.13.\n\nTable 5.13 Average particle size (DTEM), standard deviation (?) and specific surface area (ABET)\n\nof CoFe2O4 nanoparticles prepared with different concentrations of PVP.\n\nAdditive DTEM (nm) ?

Further studies such as reaction time in the presence of\n\nPVP needs to be done.\n\nFigure 5.18 shows X-ray diffraction patterns and evolutions of crystallite size for\n\nsamples prepared without and with PVP at different HS temperatures by 1 h.\n\nFigure 5.18 X-ray diffraction patterns showing that the PVP does not influenced the CoFe2O4\nphase formation (left) and PVP effect on crystallite sizes (right) of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles\n\nprepared at 100, 150 and 200 \u00b0C.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n89\n\nThe addition of PVP does not change the crystalline phase formation; only CoFe2O4\nphase was detected in X-ray diffraction patterns. The degree of crystallinity is similar\n\nindependently of the addition of PVP or of the PVP concentration (Figure 5.18). However\n\nPVP influences the crystallite size but keeps the trend with the temperature variation. The\n\ncrystallite sizes in the samples with PVP are bigger than for the PVP-free sample at 100\n\n\u00b0C. The crystallite size grows up to 150 \u00b0C in all samples and decrease afterwards with\n\nthe increase of temperature to 200 \u00b0C. PVP containing samples show a bigger decrease in\n\ncrystallite size when the temperature increases from 150 to 200 \u00b0C. The samples with\n\nPVP present exactly the same slope in all temperature ranges. For HS temperatures above\n\nof 150 \u00b0C, like observed in section 5.2.1 \u2013 Synthesis temperature effect, the crystallite\n\nsize decreases due to fast nucleation at high temperatures.\n\nDTA/TGA measurements were carried out aiming to understand the PVP function\n\n(capping agent or not) in hydrothermal synthesis of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles.

From measurements of size of nanoparticles (Table 5.14), it is known that the\n\nnanoparticles prepared in absence of PVP presented small size than those prepared with\n\nPVP10, which means that the nanoparticles with small size have high capacity to adsorb\n\nwater molecules in their surface, leading to a higher weight loss in the temperature range\n\nup to 150 \u00b0C when compared with PVP10. Furthermore, as the temperature increases the\n\nweight loss between nanoparticles prepared without and with PVP10 tends to be equal,\n\nwhich suggests that the PVP was not adsorbed on the surface of particles, thus not acting\n\nas capping agent [115].\n\nHysteresis loops of CFO nanoparticles prepared with and without PVP at 200 \u00b0C 1h\n\nare presented in Figure 5.20.\n\nFigure 5.20 Magnetic hysteresis loops of samples prepared with and without PVP at 200 ?C 1h.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n91\n\nAll samples showed magnetic hysteresis loops behaviour.

Films functionalization\n\n5.3.1. Electrophoretic deposition optimization\n\nIn order to achieve a good electrophoretic deposition is important to get a stable\n\nsuspension. The first step was to assess the stability of five different suspensions as a\n\nfunction of the time. CoFe2O4 nanoparticles used for EPD were prepared at 230 \u00b0C and 1h\n\nbecause, they present high crystallinity, good magnetic properties (73.2 emu/g) and small\n\nparticle size (16 mm), allowing it deposition in the pores of BaTiO3 thin films.\n\nFigure 5.27 shows a qualitative study of the stability of the 5 suspensions prepared\n\nin the same conditions based on the evaluation of the visual changes. The solvents on the\n\nvials from left to right is water, ethanol, acetone, n-hexane and n-butanol. In the first 5\n\nminutes, no changes were observed in the suspensions. After 30 minutes it could be seen\n\nthat the acetone suspension shows more sedimentation than the other ones. After 120\n\nminutes, the water and n-butanol suspensions remain practically unchanged, while\n\nethanol and acetone are very clear indicating that the nanoparticles sediment in large\n\nextend. In the water suspension after 1500 minutes is clear the start of a gradual\n\nsedimentation. From all the solvents used as dispersant, n-hexane seems to be the one in\n\nwhich, after the sedimentation of the large particles (occurring in the first 30 minutes), the\n\nnanoparticles remain stable in suspension for longer times.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n98\n\nTime\n\n(min)\n\nTime\n\n(min)\n\n0 100\n\n5 120\n\n30 1000\n\n60 1500\n\nFigure 5.27 Suspensions stability studies as a function of the time (minutes).\n\nLegend: W = water, E = ethanol, A = acetone, H = n-hexane and B = n-butanol.\n\nTo quantify the stability of the suspensions, in the first minutes, it was used a UV\n\nspectrometer Shimadzu UV-3100.

The best ones\n\nare water, n-hexane and n-butanol. The water suspension was not chosen because during\n\nthe EPD process, when a voltage is applied some bubbles appear due to the electrolysis of\n\nwater in presence of a voltage [120]. The chosen solvents for EPD optimization were n-\n\nhexane and n-butanol. Table 5.20 presents the physical properties of these two solvents\n\nimportant for EPD.\n\nTable 5.20 Viscosity and dielectric constant of n-butanol [90] and n-hexane [121].\n\nSolvent Viscosity (cP) Dielectric constant\n\nn-butanol 2.6 17.5\n\nn-hexane 0.3 1.89\n\nAt the beginning of this project, the substrates used for deposition of BaTiO3 porous\n\nmatrices and EPD optimization were purchased from Inostek. These wafers are composed\n\nwith multilayer with known composition: Pt/TiO2/SiO2/Si. The thicknesses of layers are\n\npresented in Table 5.21.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n100\n\nTable 5.21 Composition and thickness of layers of Inostek platinized Si wafers.\n\nComposition Thickness (nm)\n\nPt 150\n\nTiO2 20\n\nSiO2 300\n\nSi 150\u00d7106\n\nThe porous microstructure of the BaTiO3 films was the same in Inostek and\n\nRamtron substrates. However, for EPD optimization, during the deposition the peeling of\n\nfirst layer of Inostek substrate (not shown) was observed. The peeling occurs in both n-\n\nhexane and n-butanol suspensions. To further investigate what was occurring, other\n\ncommon dispersants were tested such as acetone and ethanol (EtOH). Citric acid (CAc)\n\nand triethanolamine (TEA) were added in order to change the suspension pH. Figure 5.29\n\nshows the conditions used in terms of suspension composition, voltage and time (on the\n\nleft) and the visual aspect of the Inostek substrates after deposition (on the right).\n\nFigure 5.29 EPD conditions (left) and visual aspect of the Inostek substrates after deposition\n\ndisplaying the peeling after Pt layer.\n\nIn all cases, the Inostek substrate was not robust enough to be kept unchanged after\n\nuse. As the Ramtron substrate shows better performance under the described conditions,\n\nthe XRD patterns of both Inostek and Ramtron bare substrates were compared in an\n\nattempt to understand the reasons of the different behaviour (Figure 5.30). The substrates\n\ndisplay similar XRD patterns, with the reflections peaks of SiO2, TiO2 and Pt. As the\n\nlayers of Ramtron substrate measured by SEM/EDS are very similar to the specifications\n\nof the Inostek, one can conclude that the reasons for the peeling behaviour should be the\n\nworse quality of this substrate in comparison to the Ramtron with a bad adhesion of the Pt\n\nSample Suspension Voltage / Time\n\nE1 EtOH + CAc 50 V / 60 s\n\nE2 EtOH + CAc 50 V / 15 s\n\nE3 EtOH + TEA 20 V / 15 s\n\nE4 Acetone + TEA 50 V / 15 s\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n101\n\nto the layers underneath.

A resume of the experiments with\n\ndifferent voltages and times is shown in Table 5.22:\n\nTable 5.22 Parameters of experiments for EPD optimization.\n\nSolvent Voltage (V) Time (s)\n\nn-\nH\n\nex\nan\n\ne\n\n250 60\n\n250 10\n\n500 10\n\n250 30\n\nn-\nB\n\nut\nan\n\nol 250 60\n\n500 30\n\n500 10\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n102\n\nThe results of these experiments are presented in Figure 5.31 for n-hexane\n\nsuspension and Figure 5.32 for n-butanol suspension.\n\nFigure 5.31 SEM micrographs of EPD optimization experiments for n-hexane suspension using\n\ndifferent voltages (250 and 500 V) and deposition times (10, 30 and 60 s).\n\nFor the same voltage, in n-hexane medium, the amount of deposited nanoparticles\n\nincreases with the deposition time. The use of 250 V allows a better control of the\n\ndeposition, as the difference between different times of deposition becomes clear. There\n\nis not a big difference between the films prepared at 500 V for 10 or 30 s. For all the\n\nconditions, the deposited nanoparticles seem to be agglomerated.\n\nFor n-butanol experiments, as it can be seen in Figure 5.32, the amount of deposited\n\nnanoparticles is much lower than in the case of n-hexane suspension. This fact is related\n\nto the dielectric constant of each solvent. As the dielectric constant of the n-butanol (17.5)\n\nis quite high, a high ionic concentration is present at the solution, decreasing the mobility\n\nof the species.\n\n250V 60s 500V 30s\n\n500V 10s 250V 30s\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n103\n\nFigure 5.32 SEM micrographs of EPD optimization experiments for n-butanol suspension using\n\n250 and 500 V and deposition times of 10, 30 and 60 s.\n\n5.3.2. Porous BaTiO3 films functionalization\n\nTo functionalize the porous BaTiO3 matrices, it was used the n-hexane suspension,\n\n250 V and 30 seconds of deposition time. The depositions were performed on the top of\n\nC8 BaTiO3 film. C8 porous film was prepared using the PS-b-PEO with Mw of 58600-\n\n71000 gmol-1. C8 presents ordered hexagonal arrangement of pores but pores sizes\n\naveraging around 29 nm. As observed in Figure 5.33, after the deposition the\n\nnanoparticles are still agglomerated. They are laying down at the top of the film. Almost\n\nno particles go into the pores.\n\n250V 60s 500V 30s\n\n500V 10s\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #5 | Results and discussion\n\n104\n\nFigure 5.33 SEM micrographs of porous BaTiO3 thin films with CoFe2O4 nanoparticles (250V\n\n30s).\n\nFor further optimization of the electrophoretic mobility of species on n-butanol\n\nsuspensions a small amount of 0.6 mM iodine was added to the suspension. This time it\n\nwas chosen in order to functionalise the porous BaTiO3 thin film C1 as-prepared with the\n\nblock co-polymer with Mw of 40000-53000 gmol-1. Although the microstructure of C1 is\n\nnot so ordered as the one of C8, the pore size is larger (~61 nm) which may facilitate the\n\ndeposition. In Figure 5.34 is presented the functionalized C1 porous film, using a voltage\n\nof 100 V and 1 minute of deposition time.\n\nFigure 5.34 Functionalization with suspension n-butanol + iodine (0.6mM) 100V 60s.\n\nIt was observed that, effectively large and less ordered pores facilitate the\n\nfunctionalization. A possible explanation for this behaviour can be besides the large pore,\n\nwhich can accommodate easily one or more ferromagnetic particle, a better connectivity\n\nwith the conductive substrate. By adding 0.6 mM of iodine, the amount of deposited\n\nnanoparticles was increased even with low voltage.\n\n\n\nCarla F. Silva Multifunctional films from porous matrices\n\nConclusions\n\nAnd Future work\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #6 | Conclusions and future work\n\n107\n\n6. Conclusions\tand\tfuture\twork\n\n6.1. Ferroelectric thin films\n\nPorous BaTiO3 films were successfully obtained by combining two methodologies:\n\nevaporation induced self-assembly and dip-coating. The effect of type of annealing, Mw of\n\nblock copolymer and polymer concentration was observed. The annealing type (with or\n\nwithout ramp) does not influence the microstructure of porous thin films. The copolymer with\n\nhigher molecular weight permits the pores organization and creates smaller pores. Further\n\nstudies need to be done to understand the formation of small pores using block co-polymer\n\nwith molecular weight (58600-71000). High concentrations of block co-polymer PS-b-PEO\n\nlead to formation of interconnected pores due to high pore density. The thickness of porous\n\nBaTiO3 thin films decreases with annealing temperature due to the crystallization of material.\n\nThe film thickness also depends on withdrawal speed since high speeds form thick films.\n\nFor a more complete study of ferroelectric porous thin films, a series of tasks and\n\nfurther characterizations must be taken into consideration. Principally, a controlled correlation\n\nbetween porosity magnitudes with the film thickness, will diminish topography deformation,\n\nincrease polarization and therefore induce topography \u2013 piezoresponse information\n\nindependence and allow a successful polarization hysteresis loop measurement. In addition,\n\nan indispensable evidence for the piezoelectric character in materials is the switching of the\n\nferroelectric domains, by the application of DC bias voltage. Changing by positive to negative\n\nvoltage application direction, the domains are reoriented respectively. Last but not least, an\n\noptimization of the combination between the technical characteristics of the cantilever tip\n\n(geometry, spring constant, resonant frequency), the applied voltage amplitude and the\n\nfrequency is necessary for noise minimization.\n\nThese porous matrices are a good candidate for pyroelectric and multifunctional\n\napplications due to porous microstructure.\n\nThe preparation of dense films in the same conditions as porous films (withdrawal\n\nspeed, molecular weight and concentration of co-polymer) are suggested in order to study the\n\neffect of porosity on dielectric constant and ferroelectric properties. The effect of block co-\n\npolymer concentration could affect the thickness of porous thin films, therefore studies on this\n\ndirections need to be done.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #6 | Conclusions and future work\n\n108\n\n6.2. Hydrothermal synthesis\n\nThe effect of various parameters on HS of CoFe2O4 nanoparticles was successfully\n\nstudied. For the temperature of HS effect, it can be concluded that the crystallite size increases\n\nfor temperatures between 100 and 150?C, but above this temperature, the particle size\n\ndecreases due to a fast nucleation and reduction of available precursors in solution avoiding\n\ntheir growth. The magnetic properties increase with temperature of HS due to the high\n\ncrystallinity of samples synthesized at higher temperatures. At low HS temperature it was\n\nverified a drop of the magnetization at 0 Oe field which indicates the presence of a soft\n\nmagnetic impurity. The samples prepared at 230\u00b0C 3h and 24h show the presence of hematite\n\nphase which impairs the magnetic properties due to the presence of a antiferromagnetic phase,\n\nhematite. The effect of PVP addition was studied. PVP addition does not influence the shape\n\nof nanoparticles, however promotes the nanoparticles growth. The crystallite size increases\n\nwith the PVP addition, which did not acts as capping agent. The crystallinity and magnetic\n\nproperties were not affected by PVP addition. The concentration of Co2+/Fe3+ does not\n\ninfluence the shape of nanoparticles. However, the crystallite size increases for higher\n\nconcentration due to the presence of more available precursors of crystal growth.\n\nNanoparticles prepared with high concentration of Co2+/Fe3+ show the higher saturation\n\nmagnetization measured at 10 K, 85.6 emu/g, and low coercive field (3195 Oe) meaning that\n\nthis material easily achieves saturation magnetization and easily this Ms could be withdrawn.\n\nThe concentration of NaOH influences the nanoparticles shape and size. For higher\n\nconcentrations nanoparticles show rhomb shape and the crystallite size is higher. The\n\nnanoparticles prepared with low concentration of NaOH (6M) showed the presence of an\n\nantiferromagnetic phase (hematite). However, it is in small weight and did not influence the\n\nmagnetic properties.\n\nStudies of effect of PVP for longer times of hydrothermal synthesis would be interesting\n\nto be done.  A heating rate during the hydrothermal synthesis could avoid the rapid nucleation\n\nof nanoparticles, reducing their sizes. Lower concentrations than 6 M of NaOH should be\n\nused in hydrothermal synthesis in order to understand the formation of hematite phase.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER #6 | Conclusions and Future Work\n\n109\n\n6.3. Functionalization by EPD\n\nThe effect of stability of different suspensions for EPD was observed. Voltage and time\n\nof deposition effects were studied in order to optimize the electrophoretic deposition of\n\nCoFe2O4 nanoparticles.\n\nThe chemical and physical stability of substrates is a very important key to take into\n\naccount.\n\nEPD is a good candidate to functionalize porous BaTiO3 thin films however, the\n\ndeposition of nanoparticles does not occur in the pores of BaTiO3 thin films as desired due to\n\nan agglomeration of nanoparticles. More studies need to be done in order to disperse CoFe2O4\nnanoparticles and get a successful EPD.\n\n7. Final\tnotes\n\nThis thesis allowed to get significant knowledge about ferroelectric, ferromagnetic and\n\nmultiferroic materials, which was not acquired during the Master in Engineering Materials\n\ncurricular activities. New methods for synthesis of thin films and magnetic nanoparticles were\n\nlearned. The properties of final products could be easily manipulated by changing some\n\nprocess parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarla F.
