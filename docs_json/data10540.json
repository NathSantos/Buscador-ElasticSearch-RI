Introduction\n\nThe nesting behaviour of the giant Amazon river turtle \ncomprises seven phases: aggregation of the population in \nshallow waters close to the nesting beach; climb up the \nbeach to sunbathe during the warm hours of the day; climb \nup the beach at night to scout and select the nesting site; \nexcavation of the nest; egg laying; backfilling and tamping \nthe egg chamber; and return to the water (Vanzolini, 1967; \nAlho et al., 1979; Alho and P\u00e1dua, 1982a).\n\nThe reproduction of the family Podocnemididae depends \non the annual flooding and ebbing cycle, with egg-laying \nand incubation occurring in the dry season and hatching \ncoinciding with the onset of rising rivers (Alho and P\u00e1dua, \n1982a; Fach\u00edn-Ter\u00e1n, 1992; Thorbjarnarson et al., 1993). \nThe onset of falling water levels appears to be the stimulus \nthat triggers the migration of female Podocnemis expansa \nto the nesting site, since adults are found in lakes during \nthe flood period and aggregated in rivers in the dry season \n(Alho and P\u00e1dua, 1982a,b).\n\nAlthough the status of natural populations is unknown, \nthe basis of turtle preservation activities involves nest and \nhatchling protection and management (Crouse et al., 1987), \nsince predation pressure occurs mainly in these phases of \nthe life cycle of these reptiles (Grand and Beissinger, 1997).\n\nAccording to Gibbons (1970), for aquatic chelonians, \nthe path from the nest to the water represents their main \nbattle for survival, for hatchlings are at their most vulnerable \nalong this trajectory, where they may be attacked by a \nvariety of predators.\n\nIn view of the above information, the objective of \nthis study was to determine the percentage of hatched and \nunhatched eggs, hatchling survival and mortality, and the \naverage number of live and dead hatchlings, unhatched \neggs and total number of eggs of P. expansa from natural \nnests in the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) of \nMeanders of the Araguaia River, state of Goi\u00e1s, Brazil.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n\nUnder SISBIO (System of Authorization and Information \nabout Biodiversity) permit number 13447, the P. expansa \nnesting beaches in the Meanders of the Araguaia river EPA \n(13\u00b0 17\u2019 49.0\u201d S and 50\u00b0 36\u2019 16.5\u201d W until 13\u00b0 30\u2019 00.0\u201d S \nand 50\u00b0 43\u2019 29.51\u201d W), located in district of Luiz Alves, \nmunicipality of S\u00e3o Miguel do Araguaia, Goi\u00e1s State, \nBrazil, were labelled with signs in alphabetical order \n(Figure 1) in the second half of September 2008. \n\nThe beaches were monitored daily in the morning to \ndetect and identify egg-laying during the previous night, \nusing numbered stakes (Figure 2). This work was concluded \nin the first half of October of the same year, when all the \nfemales had spawned, making a total of 327 nests.\n\nOpening of the nests began in the second half of \nNovember and ended in the second half of December 2008. \nThe hatchlings were removed from the egg chambers and \ncounted only when they were considered \u201cmature\u201d, i.e., \nwhen their vitellus was completely absorbed (Figure 3). \n\nEach beach was identified with a sign and each nest \nwas also marked with a identification number and the date \nof hatching. This information was consolidated in a spread \nsheet. Also recorded in the spread sheet was the number \nof live hatchlings, dead hatchlings and unhatched eggs. \n\nThe hatchlings removed from the egg chambers were \ntaken to a nursery located at the headquarters of the Projeto \n\nFigure 1. Nesting beach labelled with signs in alphabetical \norder.\n\nFigure 2. Nest marked with a numbered stake.\n\nFigure 3. Egg chamber containing \u201cmature\u201d hatchlings.\n\n\n\nBraz. J.

The hatchlings \nreleased on the riverbank were the ones that survived the \n15 days in the nursery.\n\nThe data were evaluated from mean values and standard \ndeviation.\n\n3. Results\n\nA total of 29,538 live hatchlings were collected from \nthe nests and after the two-week period in the nursery, \n29,251 were released on the banks of the Araguaia, \nrepresenting a mortality rate of 0.97% in the nursery. \nHatched eggs represented 94.63% and unhatched eggs \n94.63%, while survival and mortality rates were 94.24 \nand 5.76%, respectively. Oil eggs were not observed in \nthe evaluated nests.\n\nThe mean values found per nest were: live hatchlings \n(88.98 \u00b1 23.94), dead hatchlings (0.37 \u00b1 0.93), unhatched \neggs (5.07 \u00b1 9.57) and total number of eggs (94.42 \u00b1 21.30), \nas indicated in Table 1.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nValle et al. (1973) and Alho et al. (1979) verified \nsome P. expansa nests presented up to 5 abnormal eggs. \nAbnormalities included absence of embryo, diameter \ngreater than 5 cm and eggs with content intact even after \nincubation period. Eggs with these abnormalities are \nreferred to as oil eggs (Alho et al., 1979). The shape of \noil eggs can be elliptical, spherical, oval and even similar \nto the shape of a bowling pin (Molina and Gomes, 1998).\n\nAccording to Hirth (1980) the marine chelonias \nspawning nests present abnormal eggs in the superficial \nlayer of the nest, suggesting they are intended as sacrifice to \nsatiate predators. But Krause et al. (1982) found abnormal \neggs in both in the superficial and interior layers of \nTrachemis dorbignyi (water tiger) nests suggesting the \ndistribution aids the conservation of the nest microclimate. \nIn the present study, oil eggs were not observed in the \nevaluated nests to support or refute the previous studies. \n\nThe mean total number of eggs and of dead hatchlings \nper female were lower than those reported by Lima \n\n(2007) at the Tabuleiro do Abufari, state of Amazonas, \nbetween 1998 and 2004, which were 106.70 \u00b1 28.38 and \n4.00 \u00b1 9.50, respectively. However, the mean number of \nlive hatchlings and the hatching rate in the Meanders of \nthe Araguaia River EPA were higher than those found \nby the aforementioned author, who reported values of \n66.00 \u00b1 39.70 and 77.80%.\n\nIn studies conducted by Malv\u00e1sio et al. (2005) in the \nJava\u00e9s river, state of Tocantins, the mean number of eggs \nper nest was higher (109.89 \u00b1 19.37) than in the present \nstudy, although similar values (91.5) were found by Alho \nand P\u00e1dua (1982b) in the Trombetas river, state of Par\u00e1.\n\nThe high standard deviation in the number of dead \nhatchlings and unhatched eggs found in this study was \nattributed to the total loss of five nests (Figure 4). This loss \nwas caused by the low level of these nests in relation to the \nwater sheet of the Araguaia River, which resulted in their \npartial inundation, altering the proper humidity coefficient \nfor embryo development. According to Alho and P\u00e1dua \n(1982b), the sudden and unpredictable flooding (swell of \nrising water) of the Trombetas river in 1980 eliminated \n99% of the embryos, while the normal hatching rates in \nprevious years was, on average, 95%. \n\nEven at risk of inundation, the five nests of this study \nwere not translocated. According to Lustosa (2008, \npersonal observation), no relevant alterations were found in \nhatching and hatchling survival rates after handling several \negg chambers, but the number of malformed hatchlings \nwas considerably higher than among non-handled nests. \nValenzuela et al. (1997) stated that translocating eggs \nmay also interfere in determining the sex of hatchlings, \n\nTable 1. Mean values and standard deviation of the reproductive indices of natural nests of Podocnemis expansa in the \nMeanders of the Araguaia River EPA.\n\nReproductive indices Mean (%) Standard deviation (%)\nLive hatchlings 88.98 23.94\nDead hatchlings 0.37 0.93\nUnhatched eggs 5.07 9.57\n\nTotal eggs 94.42 21.30\n\nFigure 4. Egg chamber lost due to sudden flooding of the \nAraguaia River.\n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 2012, vol. 72, no. 1, p. 199-203\n\nAlves-J\u00fanior, JRF. et al.\n\n202\n\nwhich is directly related to the temperature of incubation. \nMalv\u00e1sio et al. (2005) found that handling P. expansa \neggs and exposing them to variations in temperature and \nhumidity may interfere in the formation of the embryo. \nThese authors reported that handling involving measuring \nand rotating of eggs interferes negatively in the hatching \nrate. Moreover, such handling may lead to predation of \nturtle embryos by fly larvae introduced accidentally into \nthe egg chamber (Pezzuti, 1998).\n\nSalera J\u00fanior et al. (2009) observed that on their journey \nto the water, newly hatched P. expansa turtles are attacked \npredominantly by birds of the genus Coragyps and the \nspecies Polyborus plancus, which engage in individual \nor group aerial attacks, capturing hatchlings close to \ntheir nests. These authors also observed that the species \nJabiru mycteria and Mycteria americana, which are larger, \nswallow the hatchlings whole, while the smaller species \nsuch as Coragyps atratus devour them in pieces, leaving \nonly the empty shell on the sand. This fact demonstrates \nthe importance of capturing hatchlings while they are still \nin their egg chambers, as the team of the Chico Mendes \nInstitute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) does to \nmitigate the predation rate. \n\nThe most common predators of P. expansa eggs and \nhatchlings are the black-headed vulture (Coragyps atratus), \nthe red-headed vulture (Cathartes aura), the lesser yellow-\nheaded vulture (Cathartes burrovianus), the carcara \nplancus (Polyborus plancus), the yellow-headed caracara \n(Mivalgo chimachima), the jabiru stork (Jabiru mycteria), \nthe wood stork (Mycteria americana), the maguari \nstork (Ciconia maguari) and the great white egret \n(Casmerodius albus) (Salera J\u00fanior et al., 2009). These \nauthors also found mild predation by the tegu lizard \n(Tupinambis teguixin), the ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua), \ncrab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), cocoi heron (Ardea cocoi), \nsnowy egret (Egretta thula) and the rufescent tiger-heron \n(Tigrisoma lineatum).\n\nPiranhas of the genus Serrasalmus spp. stand out as \naquatic predators of hatchling turtles (Salera J\u00fanior et al., \n2009), but other predators may be frogs (Buffo sp.), \ncaimans (Paleosuchus spp., Caiman crocodilus) and \ncarnivorous fish such as long-whiskered catfish (Pimelodidae), \nred-tailed catfish (Phractocephalus hemiliopterus), \nsilver arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum), piraiba \n(Brachyplatystoma filamentosum) and jau (Paulicea luetkeni) \n(Ibama, 1989). \n\nCantarelli and Herde (1989) and Andrade (2004) state \nthat hatchlings should be kept in nurseries for periods of up \nto 15 days, sufficient time for hardening of the carapace, \numbilical cicatrisation and elimination of the characteristic \nstrong odor of the fat of the egg. This procedure hinders \npredation by natural enemies and increases the chances of \nsurvival of hatchlings, thus justifying keeping them for 15 \ndays in the nursery of the Meanders of the Araguaia river \nEPA in order to reduce predation pressure.\n\nAccording to Crouse et al. (1987), the phase of life \nof chelonians to be prioritized in management programs \nfor threatened populations has still not been defined. \n\nCrouse et al. (1987) and Brooks et al. (1991) stated that, from \nthe demographic viewpoint, there is no point in focusing \non the protection of eggs and hatchlings. However, Grand \nand Beissinger (1997) claim that both conservation and \nrecovery of native populations depend on the protection \nof nests and hatchlings, since predation pressure occurs \nmainly in these phases of the life cycle of these animals. \nTherefore, the conservation and management programmes \nconducted by ICMBio at the Meanders of the Araguaia \nriver EPA are of fundamental importance for the recovery \nand preservation of the natural populations of P. expansa \nin the state of Goi\u00e1s, Brazil.\n\nIn general, excessive management of the reproductive \nprocess of chelonians can impair the trophic chain and \ninterfere in the population dynamics of other species \nexisting at a location, insofar as it changes the availability \nof food, and is therefore not recommended. \n\nThe reproductive efficiency of the wild population of \nP. expansa can be affected by many environmental factors \nsuch as temperature, humidity and rainfall. In addition, \nmen-maid factors like the presence of chemical in the \nwater and the potential for infectious disease also have \nsignificant impact. The reproductive indices data obtained \nfrom this study are indispensable for future investigations \nof hatching anomalies.\n\nReferences\n\nALHO, CJR., CARVALHO, AG. and P\u00c1DUA, LFM. 1979. \nEcologia da tartaruga da Amaz\u00f4nia e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de seu manejo \nna Reserva Biol\u00f3gica do Trombetas.
