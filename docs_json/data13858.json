In the first part we study the existence of solutions\nto a semilinear elliptic equation in the whole space and with dependence on the gradient and\nwhere no restriction is imposed on the behavior of the nonlinearity at infinity. We prove that\nthere exists a solution which is locally unique and inherits many of the symmetry properties\nof the nonlinearity. Positivity and asymptotic behavior of the solution are also addressed.\nOur results can be extended to other domains like half-space and exterior domains and also\nto some fractional operators. For the second part, we analyse the asymptotic behavior of\nsolutions to the one dimensional fractional version of the porous medium equation introduced\nby Caffarelli and V\u00e1zquez and where the pressure is obtained as the inverse of the fractional\nLaplacian of the density. Due to the convexity of the kernel of the Riesz potential in one\ndimension, we show that the entropy associated with the equation is displacement convex\nand satisfies a functional inequality involving also entropy dissipation and the Euclidean\ntransport distance. An argument by approximation shows that this functional inequality is\nenough to deduce the exponential convergence, in the entropy level, of solutions to the unique\nsteady state. A new interpolation inequality is also proved in order to obtain the exponential\ndecay also in ?? spaces.\n\nKeywords: Semilinear elliptic equation; Existence of solutions; Asymptotic behavior of\nsolutions; Fractional Laplacian; Optimal Transport.\n\nResumo\n\nAnalisaremos dois problemas neste trabalho. Na primeira parte, estudaremos a exist\u00ean-\ncia de solu\u00e7\u00f5es para uma equa\u00e7\u00e3o el\u00edptica semilinear no espa\u00e7o euclidiano todo e com de-\npend\u00eancia do gradiente e onde nenhuma restri\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 imposta sobre o comportamento da n\u00e3o\nlinearidade no infinito. Provaremos que existe uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o que \u00e9 localmente \u00fanica e que\nherda muitas das propriedades de simetria da n\u00e3o linearidade.

Na segunda parte, analisaremos o comporta-\nmento assint\u00f3tico das solu\u00e7\u00f5es da vers\u00e3o fracion\u00e1ria unidimensional da equa\u00e7\u00f5es de meios\nporosos introduzida por Caffarelli e V\u00e1zquez e onde a press\u00e3o \u00e9 obtida como a inversa do\nlaplaciano fracion\u00e1rio da densidade.

More explicitly we\nwill study the existence, symmetry and asymptotic behavior of solutions to the following\nnonlinear elliptic PDE:\n\n?? + ?(?, ?, ??) = 0 in R? (0.0.1)\n? ? 0 as |?| ? ?, (0.0.2)\n\nwith ? ? 3 and where ? : R? \u00d7 R \u00d7 R? ? R verifies ?(?, 0, 0) ?? 0 and belong to a large class\nof nonlinear functions which include, for example, polynomial and exponential type growths\non ? or ??.\n\nIf on one hand the literature about problems with polynomial behavior is wide and very\nwell understood in many cases, on the other hand the same is not true for the exponential\ncase since many embedding results become hard to apply when dealing with this type of\nnonlinearity, specially in this case where the domain is the whole space R?. And in spite\nof this apparent lack of results, exponential-type nonlinearities appear naturally in many\ncontexts like, as said before, in geometry or in Chern-Simons gauge theory.\n\nNonlinear gradient terms also appear naturally in models connected with convective pro-\ncesses, in the physical theory of growth and roughening of surfaces or in stochastic control\ntheory. These nonlinearities involving the gradient introduce new difficulties when combined\nwith unbounded domains and strong-growth nonlinearities, preventing the use of variational\n\n1\n\n\n\nand sub-super solutions methods, Ladyzenskaya-Ural\u2019tseva conditions, Banach fixed point\ntheorem in Sobolev spaces, implicit function theorem, compactness arguments, and Leray-\nSchauder theory, among others.\n\nIn smooth bounded domains ? ? R?, there is a rich literature for (0.0.1)-(0.0.2) with gen-\neral conditions on ?(?, ?, ??) for existence of solutions, including polynomial or exponential-\ntype growths. In this case existence results have been studied by means of different ap-\nproaches involving the aforementioned arguments and techniques. For that matter, the reader\nis referred to [5, 4, 36, 35, 50, 48, 66, 67] and their bibliographies. As pointed out in [35]\nand [48], the use of techniques based on maximum principles in most cases imposes that the\nnonlinearity grows at most quadratically in ??. This kind of restriction appears in the works\n[5, 18, 40, 60], and was overcame in [68] for a logistic equation with |??|? with ? > 1 and in\nbounded domains by combining bifurcation methods and ? 1-a priori bounds.\n\nFor the case of explosive boundary conditions, that is ? ? ? as ? ? ?? (or as |?| ? ?),\nexistence of solutions for (0.0.1) have been addressed in bounded domains ? and in R? by\nconsidering at most polynomial growth at infinity on the gradient ?? (see e.g. [2], [53],\nand [42] in R?). For example, the authors of [42] assumed ??(?, ??) = ?1(?) \u00b1 ?2(??)\nwith increasing continuous ? and ? having at most power growth at infinity and ?(?, 0, 0) =\n?1(0) = ?2(0) = 0. We also mention the work [3] for existence of distributional solutions in\nR? with polynomial growth on both ? and ??, and without prescribing conditions on ? as\n|?| ? ?.\n\nEven when ? is independent of ??, the problem (0.0.1)-(0.0.2) in the whole space R?\n\nwith exponential-type growths on ? has been considered in dimension ? = 2 in the majority\nof papers. Usually it is used Trudinger-Moser type inequalities and variational methods for\nproving existence of solutions (see e.g. results of [82] with ? = 2 and its references). In the\ncase of bounded domains, a well known problem arises particularly when\n\n?(?, ?, ??) = ?? (?)??, (0.0.3)\n\nwhich was studied e.g. in [36, 65, 72, 80] (see also their references) with ? being a positive\nbounded smooth function, where the parameter ? is assumed to be positive and sufficiently\nsmall.\n\nOne of the goals of the work on chapter 1 is to provide existence results by using a\nrelatively simpler strategy but new for this prototypical situation. We will overcome this\n\n2\n\n\n\nproblem on arbitrary growth at infinity and on the noncompactness of the domain by looking\nfor controlled solutions ? in the space ?? (defined on Section 1.2) which already have a good\ndecay in |?| and also in |??|. This choice on the space of functions is going to be enough to\nprove that the functional associated with the nonlinearity ? is an operator on ??. A further\nsmallness condition is imposed on ?(?, ., .) in order to make the operator a contraction on a\nsubset of ??. The solution is then obtained as a fixed point of this operator. It is worthy\nof note that this existence result is only local. There are no signs about when this solution\nmight be unique or about any kind of multiplicity.\n\nSeveral symmetry and asymptotic behavior results are also addressed, showing that the\nsolutions inherit many of the properties of the nonlinearity ?.\n\nThis first part was done under the supervision of Prof. Lucas C. F. Ferreira and Prof.\nMarcelo Montenegro at the State University of Campinas - Unicamp and was funded with\nscholarships from Capes and CNPq. The results will also appear in [43].\n\nThe Chapter 2 is dedicated to the analysis of the long-time asymptotics of the nonlinear\nnonlocal equation\n\n??? = ? \u00b7\n(?\n?(?(??)??? + ??)\n\n)?\n, ? > 0, ? ? R? , (0.0.4)\n\nobtained from the fractional version of the porous medium equation introduced by Caffarelli\nand V\u00e1zquez [20, 21]\n\n?? ? = ? \u00b7 (??(??)???) , (0.0.5)\n\nby passing to self-similar variables.\n\nThe equation (0.0.5) is one of the two fractional variations of the classical porous medium\nequation and the existence of solutions was first studied by Caffarelli and V\u00e1zquez in [20]. In\nthat work, the authors proved that whenever an initial data ?0 belongs to ?1(R?) ? ??(R?)\nwith the following decay:\n\n0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| , for some ?, ? > 0 , (0.0.6)\n\nthen there exist a weak solution ? such that ? ? ?([0, ?); ?1(R?)). The following other\nproperties were also obtained in [21, 20, 19]:\n\n3\n\n\n\n\u2022 The mass of any solution is preserved, i.e.,\n??\nR?\n\n?(?, ?) ?? =\n??\nR?\n\n?0(?) ?? , for all ? > 0 ;\n\n\u2022 Regularity: the weak solutions are ? ?(R?) for some ? &lt;1;\n\n\u2022 The sign is conserved: if ?0(?) > 0 for all ? ? R? then ?(?, ?) > 0 for all ? > 0 and\n? ? R?;\n\n\u2022 The positivity is conserved: if ?0(?0) > 0 for some ?0 then ?(?, ?0) > 0 for all ? > 0.\n\n\u2022 Compactness of the support: if supp ?0 is compact then supp ?(?, .) is also compact\nfor all ? > 0.\n\n\u2022 Exponential decay: If ?0 satisfies the condition (0.0.6), then there exist a function\n? = ?(?), which is increasing when 1/2 6 ? 6 1 and constant when 0 &lt;? &lt;1/2, such\nthat\n\n?(?, ?) 6 ???(? )? ??|?| ;\n\n\u2022 There exist constants ?, ?1 and ?2 depending on ? and ? such that\n\nsup\n??R?\n\n|?(?, ?)| 6\n?\n\n? ?\n??0?\n\n?\n?1 , for all ? > 0\n\n\u2022 Stationary solution: for each initial mass ? :=\n??\n\n?0(?)?? of the rescaled equation (0.0.4)\nthere exists only one stationary solution ??,?. This solution is ? 1?? with compact\nsupport and the solution ?(?, ?) with ?(0, .) = ?0 satisfies\n\n??(?, .) ? ??,???1 , ??(?, .) ? ??,???? ? 0 as ? ? ? .\n\n\u2022 Asymptotic behavior: for each initial mass ? :=\n??\n\n?0(?)?? there exists a weak solution\n?? (?, ?) of (0.0.5) such that, for every solution ?(?, ?) with ?(0, .) = ?0, we have\n\n??(?, .) ? ?? (?, .)??1 ? 0 and ?\n? ??(?, .) ? ?? (?, .)??? ? 0\n\nas ? ? ?.\n\n4\n\n\n\nIn spite of the asymptotic behavior given by the last two items above, no rate of conver-\ngence was established for these results in [21] and thus, we shall show in the Chapter 2 that\nin some cases we actually have an exponential decay for the difference ??(? ) ? ?? (? )??? and\n??(?) ? ??,???? .\n\nDue to the divergence structure of the equation (0.0.4), it is possible to identify its\nsolutions (at least when ? = 1) as gradient flows of the associate entropy ? on the space\n?2(R) of probability measures when this one is equipped with the Wasserstein distance.\nThis idea was presented by Otto in [63] and has been extensively studied and used to obtain\nquantitative and qualitative properties of solutions to equations of this kind. With respect\nto long time behavior, there is two approaches which has appeared in the literature and both\ntake advantage of the entropy functional associated to the equation. In our case we can\ndefine the entropy of a solution ? in the instant ? as\n\n? (?(?)) =\n1\n2\n\n??\nR?\n\n{?\n(??)???(?, ?) + ?|?|2\n\n}?\n?(?, ?) ?? ,\n\nand its dissipation as\n\n?(?) =\n??\nR?\n\n?\n\n????\n??\n(?\n\n(??)??? +\n?\n\n2\n|?|2\n\n)?????\n?\n2\n\n?? ,\n\nIt is known that rates of convergence for the functional ? lead to rates in some ?? spaces,\nas one can see by results like Csisz\u00e1r-Kullback-Pinsker Inequality and its variants. Thus, in\norder to estimate the behavior of ? we can proceed in two ways: for the first one, known\nas Bakry-\u00c9mery method and used in [8], we first note that, at least formally, for sufficiently\nsmooth solutions ? we have\n\n?\n\n??\n(? (?(?)) ? ? (??,?)) = ??(?(?)) , (0.0.7)\n\nand also\n?\n\n??\n?(?(?)) = ?2??(?(?)) ? ?(?(?)) (0.0.8)\n\nwith ? > 0. Therefore this last relation together with the Gronwall\u2019s Inequality imply that\n\n?(?(?)) 6 ?(?0)??2?? ,\n\n5\n\n\n\nand thus ?(?(?)) ? 0 as ? ? ?. Now, integrating (0.0.8) on [?, ?) and using (0.0.7) we\nobtain\n\n??(?(?)) =\n?? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n?(?(?)) ?? 6 ?2?\n\n?? ?\n?\n\n?(?(?)) ??\n\n= 2?\n?? ?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n??\n? (?(?)) ?? = 2? (? (??,?) ? ? (?(?))) . (0.0.9)\n\ni.e.,\n? (?) ? ? (??,?) 6\n\n1\n2?\n\n?(?). (0.0.10)\n\nThis inequality and the relation (0.0.7) imply\n\n?\n\n??\n(? (?(?)) ? ? (??,?)) 6 ?2? (? (?(?)) ? ? (??,?)) (0.0.11)\n\nand, by Gronwall again, we obtain that\n\n? (?(?)) ? ? (??,?) 6 ??2?? (? (?0) ? ? (??,?)) .\n\nAnother way of obtaining this decay is trying to establish the inequality (0.0.10) directly\nand so applying it to the relation (0.0.7) to obtain (0.0.11). This approach usually requires\nless regularity from the solutions and can be done by optimal transportation methods since\nwhat we want is a functional inequality for measures. In the Chapter 2 we shall use this\nsecond approach and we shall obtain rigorously a generalized version of (0.0.10) for a good\nset of measures in ?2(R) and apply it to the solutions of (0.0.4). The inequality (0.0.10)\nappears in [21] as an open question about the spectral gap. We also prove that the decay in\nthe entropy level implies a rate of convergence of the solutions towards the stationary state\nin some ?? spaces.\n\nThe inequality (0.0.10) is usually called, in the context of optimal transport, log-Sobolev\ninequality in the linear diffusion case or generalized log-Sobolev inequalities otherwise. In\nparticular, it becomes the logarithmic Sobolev inequality [46] for linear Fokker-Planck equa-\ntion [7, 28, 73], and a special family of Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities for nonlinear Fokker-\nPlanck equations with porous medium type diffusion [37, 26, 29]. This inequality is closely\nrelated with the notion of displacement convexity of functionals over ?2(R) which will be\ndefined and explored in the Sections 2.2 and 2.3.\n\nAll the results proved in this work about the rate of convergence of solution to (0.0.4) are\n\n6\n\n\n\nvalid only in dimension 1. This restriction is due to the fact that we need to use the convexity\nof the kernel ??,?|?|2???, used in the definition of (??)??, in order to obtain a generalized\nversion of the log-Sobolev inequality. It is worth of note to say that the problem of obtaining\nany rate for the long-time asymptotic behavior of ?(?, .) is still an open problem.\n\nThis second work was done under the supervision of Prof. Jos\u00e9 A. Carrillo at Imperial\nCollege London during a PhD Sandwich Program from Nov/2013 till Oct/2014 and was\nfunded with a Capes/Science Without Borders scholarship. The results will also appear in\n[30].\n\n7\n\n\n\nChapter 1\n\nSemilinear elliptic equations in R?\n\nwith arbitrary growth\n\nWe analyse the existence, symmetry and asymptotic behavior of the solutions to a nonlin-\near elliptic equation in R? where the nonlinear term ?(?, ?, ??) can depend on the unknown\n? and its first order derivatives ??. No restriction is imposed on the behavior of ? at infinity\nexcept in the variable ?, and thus, our results cover nonlinearities with arbitrary growth in\n? and ??, including in particular exponential type behavior. Using a fixed point argument\nwe obtain a solution ? that is locally unique, ? 1 and with polynomial decay which inherits\nmany of the symmetry properties of ?. Positivity and asymptotic behavior of the solution\nare also addressed. The techniques, and even most of the arguments used in our results, can\nalso be applied to the case where the domain is the half-space or an exterior domain and also\nto the case involving certain ranges of the fractional Laplacian.\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nIn this chapter we analyse the existence, symmetry and asymptotic behavior of solutions\nto the following nonlinear elliptic PDEs\n\n?? + ?(?, ?, ??) = 0 in R? (1.1.1)\n? ? 0 as |?| ? ?, (1.1.2)\n\n8\n\n\n\nwith ? ? 3 and ? : R? \u00d7 R \u00d7 R? ? R verifying ?(?, 0, 0) ?? 0 and belonging to a large class of\nnonlinear functions which include, for example, polynomial and exponential type growths on\n? or ??. Since we are interested in ? depending on ? and ??, we write ?(?, ?, ?) for ? ? R,\n? ? R? and the gradient of ? with respect to the (? + 1)-last variables will be denoted by\n?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?). Throughout the paper, we frequently consider (1.1.1) with either ?(?, ?, ??),\n?(?, ?, |??|), ?(?, |?|, ??), or ?(?, |?|, |??|) with the same hypotheses on ?, except for the\nsymmetry results.\n\nExponential-type nonlinearities appear naturally in many contexts like: conformal ge-\nometry and the prescribed curvature problem in 2 dimensions, where one is interested on\ndetermining the class of functions ? : ? ? R on the manifold ? with curvature ? such\nthat the problem\n\n??? = ??2? + ? , on ? ,\n\nadmits a solution and hence, this solution leads to metric on ? which is pointwise conformal\nto the original one and has ? as its Gaussian curvature (see [34], [33], [49]); condensate\nor multivortex solutions of the (2+1)-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theory, where one is\ninterested on the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the equation\n\n?? =\n4\n?2\n\n??(?? ? 1) + 4?\n???\n\n?=1\n?? , on R2/Z \u00d7 Z ,\n\nwhere ? is a constant called Chern-Simons coupling parameter and ?? are the Dirac measures\nat the prescribed zeros ?? of the Higgs scalar (see [22, 31, 71, 75]);\n\nOn the other hand, nonlinear gradient terms appear naturally in models connected with\nconvective processes, in the physical theory of growth and roughening of surfaces or in stochas-\ntic control theory. One of the most widely studied examples is the following equation\n\n??? = ?(?)|??|2 + ?? (?) , on R? , (1.1.3)\n\nwhere ? > 0, ? is a positive continuous function and ? is a positive measurable one. The\nparabolic version of this equation was proposed by Kardar, Parisi and Zhang in [47] as a\nmodel for the evolution of the profile of a growing interface, which appears in the growth of\nsmoke, flame fronts or tumors,\n\n??? = ??? + ?|??|2 + ? (?) .\n\n9\n\n\n\nAlso, for suitable choices of ? and ? , one can view (1.1.3) as the equation for the stationary\nstates of the following model\n\n??? = ??? + |??|2\n\nwhich is the viscosity approximation of some Hamilton-Jabobi type equations (see the stan-\ndard reference [58]). The classical references in the treatment of (1.1.3) are [55] and [51],\nwhile many other results in that direction were also obtained by L. Boccardo, F. Murat, A.\nPorreta, J.-P. Puel and others.\n\nAs we said in the Introduction, the combination of the exponential growth, gradient terms\nand noncompact domains let the problem very hard to handle with standard methods since\nthe natural spaces where they look for solutions are ?? spaces and generalizations. Here we\nwill overcome all these difficulties by searching for solutions in a space where the functions\nhave an polynomial decay which will be enough to control the nonlinearity.\n\nThe organization of this chapter is as follows. We first present an integral equivalent\nform for the problem (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) in the Section 1.2 together with the spaces where we\nshall look for the solutions. Due to this integral formulation, we need to prove some lemmas\nabout convolutions and regularity of the Newtonian potential that will be used in the proof\nof the main theorem. On Section 1.3 we state our main result and we prove it by using\na fixed point argument in the spaces defined on section 1.2. Two concrete examples where\nour hypothesis are satisfied are presented, and finally we show that the solutions obtained\nfor this method inherit many of the properties of the nonlinearity ?, like the positivity and\nsymmetry, as well as the asymptotic behavior of ? and its gradient. It is worthy of note to\npoint out that by slight modifications on the proofs, our approach can be employed for other\nunbounded domains like half-space and exterior domains, with either Dirichlet or Neumann\nhomogeneous boundary conditions.\n\n1.2 Integral Formulation, Lemmas and Known Results\n\nThis section we present the integral formulation, using Green\u2019s function, which will be\nused to prove the existence of solution to (1.1.1)-(1.1.2). We shall also prove some Lemmas\nabout the Newtonian potential on the spaces used in the next section and remind some\nwell known results about regularity of elliptic equations. Let us start defining the following\n\n10\n\n\n\nweighted spaces: for a fixed ? ? R, let\n\n?? ?\n{?\n\n? measurable : ess sup\n??R?\n\n(1 + |?|)?|?(?)| &lt;?\n}?\n\nand\n?? ?\n\n{?\n? ? ? 1(R?) : sup\n\n??R?\n(1 + |?|)? (|?(?)| + |??(?)|) &lt;?\n\n}?\n,\n\nwhich are Banach spaces with respective norms\n\n????? = ess sup\n??R?\n\n(1 + |?|)?|?(?)|\n\nand\n????? = sup\n\n??R?\n(1 + |?|)? (|?(?)| + |??(?)|) .\n\nSpaces like above with the homogeneous weight |?|? have been used in [44] to treat the\nequation ?? + ?|?|??2 + ? (?)? + ? (?) = 0 for ? > ?/(? ? 2) with ? ? 3.\n\nAs we will see in the proof of Theorem 1.3.3, the choice of a proper value for ? in the\nabove spaces depends uniquely on the spaces where the function ? ?? ?(?, 0, 0) is defined and\nhow |?(?,?)?(\u00b7, ?, ??)| behaves with |(?, ??)|.\n\nThe problem (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) is formally equivalent to the following integral equation\n\n?(?) =\n1\n\n(? ? 2)??\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|??2\n\n?(?, ?(?), ??(?)) ??, (1.2.1)\n\nwhere ?? is the area of the unit sphere. Therefore, it will be convenient for our purposes to\ndenote the Newtonian potential of a function ? : R? ? R by\n\n? (? )(?) :=\n1\n\n(? ? 2)??\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|??2\n\n? (?) ??,\n\nand consider the nonlinear integral operator\n\n?(?)(?) := ? (?(\u00b7, ?, ??))(?) =\n1\n\n(? ? 2)??\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|??2\n\n?(?, ?(?), ??(?)) ??,\n\nacting in the space ??.\n\nTherefore, in order to solve the mild version (1.2.1) of (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) we just need to look\n\n11\n\n\n\nfor fixed points of the operator ? in some appropriate subset of ??.\nWe start by analyzing an integral that will be useful for our needs.\n\nLemma 1.2.1. Let ?, ? > 0 and 0 &lt;? ? ? &lt;?, then\n\nsup\n??R?\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|?\n\n1\n(1 + |?|)?\n\n?? &lt;?.\n\nProof. Let us define, for every ? ? R?, the functions ??(?) = |? ? ?|?? and ?(?) = (1 + |?|)?? .\nNow, using the simplest rearrangement inequality theorem in [57, p. 82], one has\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|?\n\n1\n(1 + |?|)?\n\n?? =\n??\nR?\n\n??(?)?(?) ?? 6\n??\nR?\n\n?*?(?)?\n*(?) ?? (1.2.2)\n\nwhere ?*? and ?* are the symmetric-decreasing rearrangements of ?? and ? respectively. For\n?*? we have that\n\n?*?(?) =\n?? ?\n\n0\n?{|??|>?}* (?) ?? ,\n\nwhere {|??| > ?}* is the ball centered at the origin with the same measure as {|??| > ?}.\nThus, we can compute\n\n|??(?)| > ? ? |? ? ?|?? > ? ? ? ? ?(?, ??1/?) .\n\nand conclude that {|??| > ?}* = ?(0, ??1/?). Hence\n\n?? ?\n0\n\n?{|??|>?}* (?) ?? =\n?? ?\n\n0\n??(0,??1/?)(?) ?? =\n\n?? |?|??\n0\n\n1 ??\n\n=\n1\n\n|?|?\n\nand ?*?(?) = |?|?? for all ? and independently of ?. In the same way we can compute ?*(?)\nand obtain that ?*(?) = ?(?) for all ? ? R?. Therefore, from (1.2.2) we have\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|?\n\n1\n(1 + |?|)?\n\n?? 6\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|?|?\n\n1\n(1 + |?|)?\n\n?? , for all ? ? R? ,\n\nwhich is finite, due to the conditions on ? and ?.\nThe following convolution lemma will be useful for some estimates and its proof can be\n\n12\n\n\n\nfound in [57, p. 124].\n\nLemma 1.2.2. Let 0 &lt;?, ? &lt;? with 0 &lt;? + ? &lt;?. Then\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|?|???\n\n1\n|? ? ?|???\n\n?? =\n?(?, ?, ?)\n|?|?????\n\nwhere ?(?, ?, ?) = ???? ??????\n??+? ????????\n\nand ?? = ???/2?( ?2 ).\n\nLet us recall the following version of the Dominated Convergence Theorem which will be\nused in the proof of the next lemma.\n\nLemma 1.2.3. Let ??, ? , ?? and ? be measurable functions on R? such that ?? ? ? a.e.\nand ?? ? ? a.e. as well. If |??| 6 ?? a.e and ?? ? ?1(R?) for all ?, and\n\n??\n?? ?\n\n??\n? as\n\n? ? ? then,\n??\n\n?? ?\n??\n\n? .\n\nThe next result gives the necessary regularity we will need for the Newtonian potential\nof a function in the space ??.\n\nLemma 1.2.4. Let 0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2 and ? ? ??+2. Then ? (? ) ? ?? and there exists a\nconstant ?? > 0 satisfying\n\n?? (? )??? 6 ?? ?? ???+2 , for all ? ? ??+2. (1.2.3)\n\nProof. First we show that ? (? ) ? ? 1(R?). For fixed ?, ? ? R? with |?| = 1 and 0 &lt;? &lt;1,\nwe define the function ??(?) = |? ? ? + ??|2?? on [0, ?]. Note that ?? is differentiable on [0, ?]\nif and only if ? ?? ? := {? + ?? | ? ? [0, ?]}. If this is the case, we may write\n\n???(?) = (2 ? ?)\n? \u00b7 (? ? ? + ??)\n|? ? ? + ??|?\n\n, for all ? ? (0, ?).\n\nBy Mean Value Theorem, for each ? ? R??? there exists ?? ? (0, ?) such that\n\n??(?) ? ??(0)\n?\n\n= (2 ? ?)\n? \u00b7 (? ? ? + ???)\n|? ? ? + ???|?\n\n. (1.2.4)\n\nSince ? is a measure-zero set, we may write\n\n? (? )(? + ??) ? ? (? )(?)\n?\n\n=\n1\n\n(? ? 2)??\n\n??\nR???\n\n(?\n??(?) ? ??(0)\n\n?\n\n)?\n? (?) ??\n\n13\n\n\n\n= ?\n1\n\n??\n\n??\nR?\n\n? \u00b7 (? ? ? + ???)\n|? ? ? + ???|?\n\n? (?) ??.\n\nFor each ? ? R???, let ?? be the function\n\n??(?) = ?\n1\n\n??\n\n? \u00b7 (? ? ? + ???)\n|? ? ? + ???|?\n\n? (?) ,\n\nwhere ?? ? (0, ?) and satisfies (1.2.4). In spite of the fact that ?? may be not unique, the\ndefinition of ??(?) ensures that a different ? satisfying (1.2.4) gives the same value to the\nexpression of ??(?). Thus ?? is well defined. Furthermore, we have that ?? ? ?0 a.e in R?\n\nas ? ? 0. Note that\n|??(?)| 6\n\n1\n??\n\n|? (?)|\n|? ? ? + ???|??1\n\n6 ??(?) , (1.2.5)\n\nwhere\n??(?) =\n\n?? ???+2\n??\n\n1\n|? ? ? + ???|??1\n\n1\n(1 + |?|)?+2\n\n? ?1(R?) ,\n\nby Lemma 1.2.1. We also have\n\n??(?) ? ?0(?) a.e. in R? and\n??\nR?\n\n??(?) ?? =\n??\nR?\n\n????(?) ?? (1.2.6)\nas ? ? 0, where\n\n????(?) = ?? ???+2\n??\n\n1\n|?|??1\n\n1\n(1 + |? + ??? ? ?|)?+2\n\n6\n?? ???+2\n\n??\n\n1\n|?|??1\n\n?1\n(1 + |?|)?+2\n\n? ?1(R?) , (1.2.7)\n\nwhere ?1 depends on ? but not on ? since we took ? &lt;1. Therefore, since ????(?) ? ???0(?)\na.e in R? as ? ? 0, we have from (1.2.6), (1.2.7) and the Dominated Convergenge Theorem\nthat ??\n\nR?\n??(?) ?? =\n\n??\nR?\n\n????(?) ?? ? ??\nR?\n\n???0(?) ?? = ??\nR?\n\n?0(?) ??. (1.2.8)\n\nThen, from (1.2.5) and (1.2.8) and the Lemma 1.2.3, we conclude that\n\nlim\n??0+\n\n? (? )(? + ??) ? ? (? )(?)\n?\n\n= lim\n??0+\n\n??\nR?\n\n??(?) ?? =\n??\nR?\n\n?0(?) ??.\n\n14\n\n\n\nThus,\n?? (? )(?) \u00b7 ? = ?\n\n1\n??\n\n??\nR?\n\n? \u00b7 (? ? ?)\n|? ? ?|?\n\n? (?) ?? , for all |?| = 1,\n\n?? (? )(?) = ?\n1\n\n??\n\n??\nR?\n\n? ? ?\n|? ? ?|?\n\n? (?) ??.\n\nFor a fixed ?0 ? R? we have\n\n|?? (? )(?0) ? ??

(? )??? = sup\n??R?\n\n{?\n(1 + |?|)?|? (?)| + (1 + |?|)?|?? (?)|\n\n}?\n6 sup\n\n??R?\n(1 + |?|)?|? (?)| + sup\n\n??R?\n(1 + |?|)?|?? (?)|\n\n= ?? (? )??? + ??? (? )??? .\n\nLet us then estimate these two terms. Beginning with the first one, we have that for every\n0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2, we can apply the Lemma 1.2.2 with ? = 2 and ? = ? ? ? ? 2 and obtain, for\nevery ? ? R?,\n\n|?

(? )??? are similar but we will include them here just for\nthe sake of completeness. In this case for 0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2, we can apply Lemma 1.2.2 with\n? = 1 and ? = ? ? ? ? 2 and obtain, for every ? ? R?,\n\n|?? (? )(?)| 6\n1\n\n??\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|??1\n\n|?

Regularity). Let ? ? ? 1,2(?) be a weak solution of ?? = ? in a domain\n? ? R? with ? ? ??(?) for some 1 &lt;? &lt;?. Then ? ? ? 2,???? (?).\n\nLemma 1.2.6 (? ? Regularity ). Let ? > 0, 0 &lt;? &lt;1 and 1 &lt;? &lt;?. If ? ? R? be\na ? ?+2,1 domain, ? ? ? ?,?(?) and ? ? ? 2,???? (?) is a weak solution to ?? = ? in ?, then\n? ? ? ?+2,?(?).\n\n1.3 Existence and symmetries\n\nThe fixed point method which will be used in this section needs an appropriate choice of\na subset ? ? ?? where the operator ? can be seen as a contraction, and this contraction\ndepends uniquely on how large the functions ?(., 0, 0) and ?(?,?)?(., ?, ?) are. Therefore, we\nshall solve the problem (1.2.1) under the following hypotheses on ?:\n\nH1) ?(?, \u00b7, \u00b7) belongs to ? 1((R \u00d7 R?)?(0, 0)) ? ?(R \u00d7 R?), for all ? ? R?;\n\nH2) There exists 0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2 such that the function ? ?? ?(?, 0, 0) belongs to ??+2;\n\nH3) For the same ? in (H2), there exists ? > 0 such that\n\nsup\n0<????? ??\n\n???\n?(?,?)?(\u00b7, ?, ??)\n\n???\n?2\n\n&lt;?,\n\nand a further smallness condition on this sup.\n\nNote that, by the choice of spaces we are dealing with, it follows from this approach that\nthe solution given by this method is already ? 1(R?).\n\n18\n\n\n\nRemark 1.3.1. For ? ? ??, (?, ??) ? 0 iff ? ? 0. In spite of the fact that ?(?, \u00b7, \u00b7) is not\ndifferentiable at the point (0, 0), we are assuming with (H3) that ?(?,?)(?, \u00b7, \u00b7) is bounded near\nto the origin. Notice that the supremum of ?.??2 in (H3) is computed by excluding ? ? 0.\n\nThe assumptions (H1), (H2) and (H3) cover many types of nonlinearities with strong\ngrowth and gradient dependence. In what follows, we give some examples.\n\nExample 1.3.2. Recall first that (1.1.1) is also being defined with ? or ?? replaced respec-\ntively by |?| or |??| in the arguments of ?.\n\n\u2022 ?(?, ?, |??|) = ?? (?)?? +?? (?)?|??| or ?? (?)??...\n??\n\n+?? (?)??...\n?|??|\n\n, for every ?, ? ?\n??+2 with 0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2, and ?, ? ? R;\n\n\u2022 ?(?, |?|, |??|) = ? (?)?|?|?1 +|??|?2 , |?|?1 + ? (?)?|??|?2 , ? (?)?|?|?1 + |??|?2 ,\n? (?)?|?|?1 |??|?2 + ? or ? (?)|?|?1 ?|??|?2 + ? , for ?1, ?2 > 1 and ?, ? ? ??+2 with\n0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2;\n\n\u2022 ?(?, |?|, |??|) = ?|?|?1 +|??|?2 ? 1 + ? (?) or ?(?, ?, ??) = ??(|?|\n?1 +|??|?2 ) ? 1 + ? (?), for\n\n?1, ?2 > 1 and ? ? ??+2 with 0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2;\n\n\u2022 ?(?, |?|, |??|) = |?|?1 + |??|?2 + ? (?) or |?|?1 |??|?2 + ? (?), for ?1, ?2 > 1 and\n? ? ??+2 with 0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2.\n\nWe will show existence of solutions for (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) in R? with ? ? 3 and conditions\non ? (see (H1)-(H3)) covering polynomial and exponential type growths on ? and ??, see\nExamples 1.3.2, 1.3.6 and 1.3.7. In particular, since ?(?, 0, 0) does not need to be continu-\nous, the nonlinearity (0.0.3) can be treated with singular potentials ? (non-continuous and\nbounded) and |?| close to zero, including also negative values (see Example 1.3.6 below).\n\nFrom now on we assume that ? > 3 and that ? : R? \u00d7 R \u00d7 R? ? R satisfies (H1)-(H3).\nWe begin with existence and local uniqueness of solutions for the integral equation (1.2.1).\n\nTheorem 1.3.3. There exists a constant ?? > 0 such that if ? : R? \u00d7 R \u00d7 R? ? R satisfies\n(H1)-(H3) for some 0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2 and the following inequalities\n\nsup\n0<????? ??\n\n???\n?(?,?)?(., ?, ??)\n\n???\n?2\n\n&lt;??\n\n19\n\n\n\nand\n??(., 0, 0)???+2 6 ???,\n\nare satisfied for some ? > 0, then the integral equation (1.2.1) has a unique solution ? ? ??\nwith ????? 6 ?, which is in particular a weak solution for (1.1.1)-(1.1.2). Furthermore, if\n? ? ? ?,???? (R? \u00d7 R \u00d7 R?) for an integer ? ? 0 with 0 &lt;? &lt;1, then ? ? ?\n\n?+2,?\n??? (R?) and ?\n\nverifies (1.1.1)-(1.1.2) classically.\n\nRemark 1.3.4. In the statement of Theorem 1.3.3, the constant ?? can be taken as 12??\nwhere ?? is as in Lemma 1.2.4 in the previous section, as we can see from the proof below.\nIn fact, in view of the proof of Lemma 1.2.4, it is possible to estimate ?? and ?? explicitly.\n\nProof. Let ? ? R?, (?, ?1, ?1), (?, ?2, ?2) ? R? \u00d7 R \u00d7 R? and [(?1, ?1), (?2, ?2)] be the closed\nline segment between (?1, ?1) and (?2, ?2) in R?+1. If (0, 0) /? [(?1, ?1), (?2, ?2)] then, from the\nhypothesis (H1), we have\n\n|?(?, ?1, ?1) ? ?(?, ?2, ?2)| 6 sup\n(?,?)?[(?1,?1),(?2,?2)]\n\n|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(?1 ? ?2, ?1 ? ?2)| .\n\nNow, if (0, 0) ? [(?1, ?1), (?2, ?2)], then we have that |(?1, ?1)| + |(?2, ?2)| = |(?1, ?1) ? (?2, ?2)|\nand, by (H1)\n\n|?(?, ?1, ?1) ? ?(?, ?2, ?2)| 6 |?(?, ?1, ?1) ? ?(?, 0, 0)| + |?(?, 0, 0) ? ?(?, ?2, ?2)|\n6 sup\n\n(?,?)?[(?1,?1),(0,0))\n|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(?1, ?1)|\n\n+ sup\n(?,?)?((0,0),(?2,?2)]\n\n|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(?2, ?2)|\n\n6 sup\n(?,?)?[(?1,?1),(?2,?2)]?(0,0)\n\n|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)|(|(?1, ?1)| + |(?2, ?2)|)\n\n= sup\n(?,?)?[(?1,?1),(?2,?2)]?(0,0)\n\n|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(?1 ? ?2, ?1 ? ?2)| .\n\nThus, for a fixed ? > 0 and ?, ? ? ?? with 0 &lt;????? , ????? &lt;?, we write (?, ??) =\n(?(?), ??(?)) to obtain\n\n|?(?, ?, ??) ? ?(?, ?, ??)| 6 sup\n(?,?)?[(?,??),(?,??)]?(0,0)\n\n|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?)||(? ? ?, ?? ? ??)|\n\n6 sup\n0<????? 6?\n\n|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)||(? ? ?, ?? ? ??)| ,\n\n20\n\n\n\nbecause for every (?, ?) with |?|, |??| &lt;?, ? = 1, . . . , ?, we can find a function ? ? ?? such\nthat ????? &lt;? and (?, ?) = (?, ??) at a point ?. Hence, we have that\n\n(1 + |?|)?+2|?(?, ?, ??) ? ?(?, ?, ??)| 6\nsup\n\n0<????? 6?\n(1 + |?|)2|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)|(1 + |?|)?|(? ? ?, ?? ? ??)| ,\n\nand by (H3), it follows that\n\n??(., ?, ??) ? ?(., ?, ??)???+2 6 sup\n0<????? 6?\n\n???\n?(?,?)?(., ?, ??)\n\n???\n?2\n\n?? ? ???? .\n\nNow, take ?? = 12?? where ?? is the constant given by the Lemma 1.2.4 and, by hypothesis,\nlet ? > 0 be such that\n\n?? := sup\n0<????? 6?\n\n???\n?(?,?)?(., ?, ??)\n\n???\n?2\n\n<\n1\n\n2??\n.\n\nWe will show that ? is a contraction in the ball ?? = {? ? ?? : ????? 6 ?}. Fix ?, ? ? ??\nand note that\n\n?(?) ? ?(?) = ? (?(., ?, ??) ? ?(., ?, ??)) ,\n\nso we can use Lemma 1.2.4 and estimate\n\n??(?) ? ?(?)??? = ?? (?(., ?, ??) ? ?(., ?, ??))???\n6 ?? ??(., ?, ??) ? ?(., ?, ??)???+2\n6 ???? ?? ? ????\n6\n\n1\n2\n\n?? ? ???? .\n\nThus for ? ? ?? and ? = 0 in the above inequality, we have\n\n??(?)??? 6 ??(?) ? ?(0)??? + ??(0)???\n6\n\n1\n2\n\n????? + ?? (?(., 0, 0))???\n\n6\n1\n2\n\n????? + ?? ??(., 0, 0)???+2\n\n21\n\n\n\n6\n?\n\n2\n+ ??\n\n?\n\n2??\n= ? ,\n\nwhich shows that ?(??) ? ??. Therefore ? is a contraction in ?? and the result follows by\napplying the Banach fixed point theorem.\n\nThe regularity of ? will follow from the fact that ? is also a solution in the weak sense to\n(1.1.1) and the classical regularity results. Indeed, since ? ? ? 1(R?), ?(., ?, ??) ? ??(R?)\nand the kernel |?|2?? is locally integrable, we have for all ? ? ? ?? (R?) that,??\n\nR?\n?? \u00b7 ?? ?? = ?\n\n??\nR?\n\n?(?)??(?) ??\n\n= ?\n1\n\n(? ? 2)??\n\n??\nR?\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|??2\n\n?(?, ?(?), ??(?))??(?) ????\n\n= ?\n??\nR?\n\n?(?, ?(?), ??(?))\n(?\n\n1\n(? ? 2)??\n\n??\nR?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|??2\n\n??(?) ??\n)?\n\n??\n\n=\n??\nR?\n\n?(?, ?(?), ??(?))?(?) ??.\n\nTherefore, ? is a weak solution. Moreover, ? is a weak solution of (1.1.1) on every ball\n? in R? and ? ? ? 1,2(?). Therefore, since we have ?(., ?, ??) ? ??(?) for all ? > 1 and\nfor every ball ?, we can use Lemma 1.2.5 and conclude that ? ? ? 2,?(?) for every ? > 1.\nTherefore, for ? > ? we have the embedding ? 2,?(?) ?? ? 1,?(?), for ? = 1 ? ?\n\n?\nand we\n\nconclude that ? ? ? 1,? (?) for every 0 &lt;? &lt;1.\n\nNow, if ? ? ? ????(R? \u00d7 R \u00d7 R?) then ?(., ?, ??) ? ? 0,?? (?) for all 0 &lt;? &lt;1 and, by\nLemma 1.2.6, we have that ? ? ? 2,?? (?). Hence ?(., ?, ??) ? ? ?(?) and we can perform\nthe previous argument once more and conclude that ? ? ? 2,?(?).\n\nTherefore, if ? ? ? 1,???? (R? \u00d7 R \u00d7 R?) we now have that ?(., ?, ??) ? ? 1,?? (?) and we can\nconclude that ? ? ? 3,?(?).\n\nRepeating the argument above we can infer that whenever ? ? ? ?,???? (R? \u00d7 R \u00d7 R?) with\n? > 1 then ?(., ?, ??) ? ? ?,?(?) and, by Lemma 1.2.6, we have that ? ? ? ?+2,?(?) for\nevery ball ?. In view of the fact that ? is a solution of (1.1.1) in the sense of distributions\nand ? ? ?? ? ? ?+2,???? (R?), then ? is a classical solution of (1.1.1)-(1.1.2).\n\nRemark 1.3.5. The fixed point theorem applied above gives an iterative method to construct\n\n22\n\n\n\nthe solution ?, which is the limit in the norm ?.??? of the following sequence\n\n?1 = ?(0) = ? (?(., 0, 0)) and ?? = ?(???1) , ? ? N.\n\nMoreover, all elements of this sequence verify ?????? ? ?.\n\nIn the sequel we present two examples.\n\nExample 1.3.6. Let ?? = 12?? where ?? is as in Lemma 1.2.4 (see Remark 1.3.4). Let ?\nand ? be real parameters and let\n\n?(?, ?, ??) = ?? (?)?? + ?? (?)?|??|,\n\nwhere ?, ? ? ??+2 for some 0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2. The case ? = 0 is the so-called Liouville\nequation which arises, as pointed out above, in many physical situations and has produced\na rich mathematical theory when ? = 2 (see e.g. [10], [41], [65], [72]). Here we solve the\nproblem for all dimension ? ? 3. We have that\n\n(1 + |?|)2|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)| =\n\n=\n(?(?\n\n|?|(1 + |?|)2|? (?)|??(?)\n)?2\n\n+\n(?\n|?|(1 + |?|)2|?

(?)|\n6 |?| ?? ???+2 + |?| ?? ???+2 .\n\nThen, Theorem 1.3.3 allows us to solve the problem of the present example if we can find\n? > 0 such that (?\n\n|?| ?? ???+2 + |?| ?? ???+2\n)?\n\n?? 6\n1\n\n2??\nand\n\n|?| ?? ???+2 + |?| ?? ???+2 6\n?\n\n2??\n\n23\n\n\n\nWe see from these inequalities that if we take\n\n? = 2??\n(?\n|?| ?? ???+2 + |?| ?? ???+2\n\n)?\n,\n\nthe problem will have a solution if ? and ? are such that\n\n2??\n(?\n|?| ?? ???+2 + |?| ?? ???+2\n\n)?\n?\n\n2??\n(?\n\n|?|?? ???+2 +|?|?? ???+2\n\n)?\n6 1\n\nThe continuous dependence of the solution with respect to ? and ? follows by using that the\nsolution ? satisfies\n\n????? 6 ?.\n\nThis means that the equation ?? + ?? (?)?? + ?? (?)?|??| = 0 has a bounded solution in R?\n\nif the parameters |?| and |?| are small enough, regardless the sign of ?, ?, ?, ? , and allowing\nto consider non-continuous coefficients ? and ? .\n\nExample 1.3.7. According to Remark 1.3.4, let us take ?? = 12?? where ?? is as in Lemma\n1.2.4. Take ? of the form ?(?, ?, ?1, . . . , ??) = ?(?, ??0 , ??11 . . . , ???? ), where ?? > 1 for all ?. If\n? = min{?0, . . . , ??} and ? = 2??1 , suppose that ?(?, 0, 0) ? ??+2 and there exists ? > 0 such\nthat ?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??) ? ?? for all ? ? ??. Then, differentiating we obtain\n\n?(?,?)?(?, ?, ?) =\n(?\n?0?\n\n?0?1???, ?1?\n?1?1\n1 ??1 ?, . . . , ???\n\n???1\n? ??? ?\n\n)?\n.\n\nIf ? ? ?? with ????? 6 1 then\n\n(1 + |?|)2|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)| 6\n\n6\n\n????\n?\n(?\n\n?0\n\n[?\n(1 + |?|)\n\n2\n?0?1 |?|\n\n]??0?1\n|???(?, ?, ??)|, . . . , ??\n\n[?\n(1 + |?|)\n\n2\n???1 |?|\n\n]????1\n|??? ?(?, ?, ??)|\n\n)?????\n?\n\n6 ?\n\n????\n?\n(?\n\n????0?1? 2\n?0?1\n\n???\n?(?,?)?(., ?, ??)\n\n???\n??\n\n, . . . , ??????1? 2\n???1\n\n???\n?(?,?)?(., ?, ??)\n\n???\n??\n\n)?????\n?\n\n6\n?\n\n? + 1? ?????1? 2\n??1\n\n???\n?(?,?)?(., ?, ??)\n\n???\n??\n\n,\n\n24\n\n\n\nwhere ? = max{?0, . . . , ??}.

The\nfollowing results show that the solution obtained by the previous theorem inherits indeed\nmany properties from the nonlinearity ?.\n\nTheorem 1.3.8. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1.3.3, the solution ? satisfies:\n\n(i) If ? > 0, then ? > 0;\n\n(ii) If ?(?, ?, ?) > 0 for all (?, ?, ?) ? R? \u00d7R\u00d7R?, with ?(?, ?, ?) ?? 0 when |(?, ?)|R\u00d7R? ? ?,\nthen ? > 0;\n\n(iii) ? is radially symmetric provided that ?(\u00b7, ?, ?) is radially symmetric for each fixed\n(?, ?) ? R \u00d7 R? such that |(?, ?)|R\u00d7R? ? ?.\n\nProof. The item (i) follows from the fact that the Newtonian potential of a nonnegative func-\ntion is nonnegative. To prove item (ii), notice that ????? ? ? implies that |(?(?), ??(?))|R\u00d7R? ?\n?, for all ? ? R?. It follows that ?(?, ?(?), ??(?)) ?? 0, and then ? = ? (?(?, ?, ??)) is posi-\ntive. To establish item (iii), recall first that the solution ? is the limit under the norm ?.???\nof the sequence ?? (see Remark 1.3.5). Notice that ?1 is radially symmetric if and only if\n?(?, 0, 0) is radially symmetric. Since ??1??? ? ?, we have that |(?1(?), ??1(?))|R\u00d7R? ? ?,\nfor all ? ? R?, and then ?2 = ? (?(?, ?1, ??1)) is radially symmetric provided that ?1 is\nradially symmetric. By induction, ?? is radially symmetric. Since the convergence in ??\npreserves radial symmetry, we conclude that ? is radially symmetric.\n\nMore results about symmetry as in item (iii) of Theorem 1.3.8 can be proved by consid-\nering orthogonal transformations in the space. Let ? be a subset of the orthogonal matrix\ngroup ?(?) of R?. We say that a function ? is symmetric under the action of ? when\n\n25\n\n\n\n?(?) = ?(? ?), for all ? ? ?. Similarly we say that ? is antisymmetric under the action of ?\nwhen ?(?) = ??(? ?), for all ? ? ?.\n\nTheorem 1.3.9. Assume the hypotheses of Theorem 1.3.3 and let ? be the solution given by\nit. Let ? be a subset of ?(?) and suppose that by the action of ?, the function ? = ?(?, ?, ?)\nsatisfies\n\n(i) ? is symmetric in ? and ?. Then ? is symmetric under ?;\n\n(ii) ? is antisymmetric in ?. Then ? ? 0;\n\n(iii) ? is antisymmetric in ?, even in ? (?.?. ?(\u00b7, ?, \u00b7) = ?(\u00b7, ??, \u00b7)) and symmetric in ?. Then\n? is antisymmetric.\n\nProof. (?)

Thus, ?1 is symmetric under ?.\nTo prove that ?2 is symmetric, notice that ??1(?) = ?(?1(? ?)) = ? ? \u00b7 ??1(? ?).

Then ?2 is symmetric as well. Using an induction argument, we see\nthat ?? is symmetric under ?, for all ? ? N. Since ? is the limit of ?? in the norm of ??,\nit preserves the symmetry.\n\n(??) Since ? antisymmetric in ?, then ?(?, 0, 0) = ?(?, 0, ? 0) = ??(?, 0, 0) implies ?(., 0, 0) ?\n0. Therefore, the fixed point of ? is ? ? 0.\n\n(???) One has ?(? ?, 0, 0) = ??(?, 0, 0), and the computations above give us ?1(? ?) =\n??1(?).

Therefore, one concludes that ? is antisymmetric.\n\nIt follows from the definition of the space ?? that the solution given by Theorem 1.3.3\nsatisfies ? = ?((1 + |?|)??) and ?? = ?((1 + |?|)??) as |?| ? ?, if ?(?, 0, 0) = ?((1 +\n|?|)???2). In the next theorem, we improve this behavior by assuming a natural condition,\nnamely if ?(?, 0, 0) = ?((1 + |?|)???2) then the solution ? and its gradient are ?((1 + |?|)??)\nas well.\n\nThe following lemma was proved in [44] and it will be necessary for the next theorem.\n\nLemma 1.3.10. Let 0 &lt;? &lt;? ? 2. If ? ? ??+2, then\n\nlim sup\n|?|??\n\n|?|?|? (? )(?)| 6 ?? lim sup\n|?|??\n\n|?|?+2|? (?)| ,\n\nwhere ?? = ?(????2,1,?)(??2)?? .\n\nTheorem 1.3.11. Let ? be as in Theorem 1.3.3. If lim\n|?|??\n\n(1 + |?|)?+2|?(?, 0, 0)| = 0, then\n\nlim\n|?|??\n\n(1 + |?|)? (|?(?)| + |??(?)|) = 0. (1.3.1)\n\n27\n\n\n\nProof. First recall that the solution given by Theorem 1.3.3 satisfies ????? ? ?. Note also\nthat, by the proof of Theorem 1.3.3, if ? ? ??, then ?(?, ?, ??) ? ??+2 and therefore\n?? = ?? (?(?, ?, ??)) ? ??+1. Thus, one concludes that\n\nlim sup\n|?|??\n\n(1 + |?|)?|??(?)| = lim sup\n|?|??\n\n(1 + |?|)?+1|??(?)|\n1 + |?|\n\n6 lim sup\n|?|??\n\n??????+1\n1 + |?|\n\n= 0.\n\nSplitting the expression (1.3.1) into two ones, one only needs to check lim\n|?|??\n\n(1+|?|)?|?(?)| = 0.\nFor that matter, one estimates\n\n|?(?, ?, ??)| 6 |?(?, ?, ??) ? ?(?, 0, 0)| + |?(?, 0, 0)|\n6 sup\n\n0<????? ??\n|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)||(?, ??)| + |?(?, 0, 0)|.\n\nUsing the hypotheses, one has\n\nlim sup\n|?|??\n\n|?|?+2|?(?, ?, ??)| 6 lim sup\n|?|??\n\n|?|?+2 sup\n0<????? ??\n\n|?(?,?)?(?, ?, ??)||(?, ??)|.\n\nBy Lemma 1.3.10, one concludes\n\nlim sup\n|?|??\n\n|?|?|?(?)| = lim sup\n|?|??\n\n|?|?|?(?)|\n\n= lim sup\n|?|??\n\n|?|?|?

It is worthy of note that many results in this chapter remain true in prob-\nlems where the associated Green\u2019s function ?(?, ?) satisfies the following estimate:\n\n|?(?, ?)| 6\n?\n\n|? ? ?|??2?\n,\n\nfor some constant ? = ?(?, ?) with 1/2 &lt;? 6 1. This includes cases like bounded domains\nwith Dirichlet\u2019s condition and also fractional Laplacians.\n\n29\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nAsymptotic Behavior for the 1D\nPorous Medium Equation with\nFractional Pressure\n\nWe analyze the rate of convergence towards the stationary state of solutions to the one\ndimensional fractional version of the porous medium equation, where the pressure is obtained\nas the inverse of the fractional Laplacian of the density. Using self-similar variables and\nthe convexity of the interaction potential in dimension one, it is possible to show that the\nassociated entropy is displacement convexity and therefore, satisfies a functional inequality\noriginated from optimal transport theory which involves also the entropy dissipation and the\nEuclidean transport distance. An argument by approximation on the equation assures that\nthis functional inequality is enough to deduce the exponential convergence of solutions to the\nunique steady state.\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nIn this chapter, we analyse the long-time asymptotics of the nonlinear nonlocal equation\n\n??? = ? \u00b7\n(?\n?(?(??)??? + ??)\n\n)?\n, ? > 0, ? ?

The\nmathematical theory behind it can be checked in the surveys [76, 77] and references therein.\n\nThe other version, which is the one of our interest here, follows from (2.1.4) and can be\nviewed as a continuity equation, ?? ? + ? \u00b7 (?v) = 0, for a density or concentration ?(?, ?)\nwith velocity v = ???, where the velocity potential or pressure ? is related to ? by the\ninverse of a fractional Laplacian operator ? = ?\n\n??1 (??)\n?????1, 0 &lt;? &lt;1. The standard\n\nporous medium equation is recovered for ? = 0 and the equation (2.1.2) when ? = 2. This\nmodel appears when one has nonlocal effects as long-range diffusive interactions and it has\nbeen studied by an extensive list of authors.\n\nWe assume that the unknown ?(?, ?), representing a density or concentration, is defined\nfor ? ? R? and ? > 0 and supply initial data ?(?, 0) = ?0(?), a nonnegative mass distribution\nin ?1(R?) ? ??(R?). We also point out that the pressure can be represented as\n\n? = (??)??? = ??,? * ?,\n\n31\n\n\n\nwith the singular convolution kernel\n\n??,?(?) = ??,?|?|2???, ??,? =\n?2?2??(?/2 ? ?)\n\n??/2?(1 + ?)\n, (2.1.5)\n\nand 0 &lt;? &lt;min(1, ?/2), called the Riesz potential of ? as in the standard textbooks [52,\n70]. This representation also makes sense for ? = ?/2 with the logarithm kernel\n\n??, ?2\n(?) = ?21?????/2?(?/2)?1 log |?|\n\n(see [23, 54] in one dimension) and for 1/2 &lt;? &lt;1 in one dimension with the negative\ncoefficient ?1,? and the positive exponent 2? ? 1 in ??,?(?). As a result, the kernel ??,?(?)\ndoes not necessarily decay to zero at infinity in the last two cases, but the magnitude of the\ngradient ???,?(?) does. When the kernel ??,?(?) is replaced by a less singular radially sym-\nmetric function, the same equation appeared in granular flow [12, 74, 56, 25] and biological\nswarming [61, 14, 13].\n\nTo describe the long time behaviour of solutions to (2.1.2), it is more convenient to study\nthe corresponding transformed equation (2.1.1) as discussed in [26, 21], by defining\n\n?(?, ?) := (1 + ? )??(?, ?), (2.1.6)\n\nwith the similarity variables ? = ?(1 + ? )?? and ? = log(1 + ? ). The exponents ? and ? can\nbe determined from dimensional analysis and the mass conservation [11], which are given by\n\n? =\n?\n\n? + 2 ? 2?\n, ? =\n\n1\n? + 2 ? 2?\n\n. (2.1.7)\n\nIn this way, the rescaled density ?(?, ?) satisfies (2.1.1) with ? = ? = 1/(? + 2 ? 2?). We will\nkeep ? > 0 arbitrary in (2.1.1) as a parameter to characterize the convexity of the energy\ndefined below and the convergence rate to the steady state later on. As a result, the long time\nbehaviour of the original density ?(?, ?) is completely specified if we establish the behavior\nof ?(?, ?) with ? = ?. Furthermore, due to the change of variables ? = log(1 + ? ), any\nconvergence of ?(?, . ) as ? ? ? is going to be slower than the one for ?(?, . ).\n\nLet us point out that the fractional porous medium equation (2.1.1) can be viewed as a\n\n32\n\n\n\nparticular case of a much more general aggregation-diffusion equation [25, 14, 9] written as\n\n??? = ? \u00b7\n(?\n??\n\n(?\n? * ? + ? + ? ?(?)\n\n)?)?\n, ? ? R? , (2.1.8)\n\nwhere ?, ? : R? ? R ? {?} and ? : [0, ?) ? R and we recover (2.1.1) for ? (?) = ?2 |?|\n2\n\nand ? (?) = ??,?|?|2???, 0 &lt;? &lt;1 and ? = 0.\n\nDuring the past fifteen years, several important techniques [63, 26, 37, 25, 78, 6] have been\ndeveloped for the convergence of linear or nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations to their steady\nstates with sharp rate. These techniques can also be employed to prove the convergence of\nsolutions of (2.1.1) as ? ? ? by realizing that the free energy ? (?) defined as\n\n? (?) =\n1\n2\n\n??\nR?\n\n{?\n(??)???(?) + ?|?|2\n\n}?\n?(?) ?? (2.1.9)\n\n=\n??,?\n2\n\n??\nR?\n\n??\nR?\n\n?(?)?(?)\n|? ? ?|??2?\n\n???? + ?\n??\nR?\n\n|?|2\n\n2\n?(?) ??,\n\nis a Lyapunov functional for 0 &lt;? &lt;min(1, ?/2). One can similarly define the Lyapunov\nfunctional for 1/2 ? ? &lt;1 in one dimension, assuming that ? satisfies a growth condition at\ninfinity, namely ? log |?| ? ?1(R) if ? = 1/2 and ?|?|2??1 ? ?1(R) if 1/2 &lt;? &lt;1. In fact,\n(2.1.1) is a gradient flow of the free energy functional (2.1.9) with respect to the Euclidean\ntransport distance in the metric space of probability measures [6, 24].\n\nThe basic properties of the energy ? (?) and its dissipation ?(?) defined below, together\nwith the long-time asymptotics of solutions to (2.1.1), are already derived in [21]. More\nprecisely, along the evolution governed by (2.1.1), one can obtain the formal relation\n\n?\n\n??\n?\n(?\n?(?, .)\n\n)?\n= ??\n\n(?\n?(?, .)\n\n)?\n, (2.1.10)\n\nwhere we denote by ?(?) the entropy production or entropy dissipation of ? given by\n\n?(?) =\n??\nR?\n\n? |??|2 ?? , with ? =\n??\n??\n\n= (??)??? +\n?\n\n2\n|?|2.\n\nUsing this relation, the solution of (2.1.1) is shown to converge towards a function ?? (which\ncoincides with the respective stationary state) in [21], but no rate of convergence is obtained.\nTo be more precise, they show that solutions of the fractional porous medium equation (2.1.1)\n\n33\n\n\n\nsatisfy the energy inequality\n\n?\n(?\n?(?, \u00b7)\n\n)?\n+\n?? ?\n\n0\n?\n(?\n?(?, \u00b7)\n\n)?\n?? ? ?\n\n(?\n?(0, \u00b7)\n\n)?\nthat is enough to conclude the converge of ?(?, ?) to the steady state ??(?).\n\nLet us now say a few words about the function ?? of (2.1.1) and its characterizations.\nThe existence and uniqueness of the steady state were initially characterized in [21] by the\nfollowing obstacle problem for the pressure ? = (??)????\n\n? (?) > ?(?) for ? ? R? ,\n(??)?? (?) > 0 for ? ? R? ,\n(??)?? (?) = 0 for ? (?) > ?(?) ,\n\nwhere the obstacle is the quadratic function ?(?) = ?* ? ?2 |?|\n2. The self-similar solution\n\nof (2.1.2) were also obtained and given by\n\n?(?, ?) = (1 + ? )??/(?+2?2?)??\n(?\n?(1 + ? )?1/(?+2?2?)\n\n)?\n.\n\nThe explicit expression for ?? was then obtained by Biler, Imbert and Karch in [15, 16] for\neven more general nonlinear dependence of the pressure ? = (??)?????1, ? > 1. In case\n? = 2 of our interest here, they obtained that\n\n??(?) = ??,?\n(?\n?2 ? |?|2\n\n)?1??\n+\n\n(2.1.11)\n\nwhere\n??,? =\n\n22??1?(?/2 + 1)\n?(2 ? ?)?(?/2 + 1 ? ?)\n\n? .\n\nThe radius ? of the support is determined by the conservation of mass, that is,\n\n1 =\n??\nR?\n\n?(?, ?)?? =\n22???/2?(?/2 + 1)?\n\n(? + 2 ? 2?)?(?/2 + 1 ? ?)2\n??+2?2?. (2.1.12)\n\nThe expression (2.1.11) allow us to check directly that ?? is in fact the minimum for the\nenergy ? by a recent result of Chafa\u00ef, Gozlan and Zitt in [32, Theorem 1.2] where it was proved\nthat ? restricted to ?(R?) is strictly convex in the classic sense for 0 &lt;? &lt;min(1, ?/2), and\n\n34\n\n\n\nit has a unique compactly supported minimizer ?? characterized by\n\n(??)????(?) + ?\n|?2|\n2\n\n= ?* , for all ? ? supp (??) (2.1.13a)\n\n(??)????(?) + ?\n|?2|\n2\n\n> ?* , a.e. R? , (2.1.13b)\n\nfor some constant ?* determined by the total mass. This formulation is equivalent to the\nobstacle problem in [21]. Using the following relation (see [15, 16])\n\n(??)??(?2 ? |?|2)1??+ =\n2?2??(2 ? ?)?(?/2 ? ?)\n\n?(?/2)\n\n(?\n?2 ?\n\n? ? 2?\n?\n\n|?|2\n)?\n\n=\n?\n\n2??,?\n\n(?\n?\n\n? ? 2?\n?2 ? |?|2\n\n)?\n, for all |?| 6 ?, (2.1.14)\n\nit is easy to verify that ?? = ??,?(?2 ? |?|2)1??+ is indeed the minimizer for ? for 0 &lt;?&lt;\nmin(1, ?/2). Similar computations can be done in the range 1/2 ? ? &lt;1, see [23, 9] for\ninstance.\n\nIn this chapter, we will focus on obtaining the sharp convergence rate for the solutions\nof the Cauchy problem for (2.1.1) towards the equilibrium ??, for all 0 &lt;? &lt;1/2 in one\ndimension, although many of the calculations presented also hold in general dimensions.\nIn the particular case of ? = 1/2 in one dimension, the kernel is given by the logarithmic\npotential and it was treated in [23], see also [54] for related functional inequalities. In fact, it\nis shown in [23] that the energy ? (?) is displacement convex, which can not be derived directly\nfrom the criteria given in the seminal paper by McCann [59]. We will take advantage of these\ntechniques in [23] to prove certain functional inequalities, in particular the HWI inequalities as\nintroduced in [64] (also obtained in [54] for the logarithmic case ? = 1/2). This displacement\nconvexity and related inequalities are then used to show the convergence towards equilibrium\nin one dimension, through the exponential decay of the transport distances and the relative\nenergy, for general ? ? (0, 1). Roughly speaking, the strategy will be as follow: since we\nalready have the relation (2.1.10) for the solutions of (2.1.1), we will prove that the following\ngeneralized log-Sobolev inequality\n\n? (?) ? ? (??) 6\n1\n\n2?\n?(?)\n\nholds for a class of probability measures ?. This inequality appears in [21] as an open problem\n\n35\n\n\n\nwith some of its equivalences. Hence, the result will follow from the Gronwall\u2019s inequality\nsince, for any solution ?(?, ?) satisfying an initial condition ?(0, .) = ?0, we have\n\n?\n\n??\n(? (?(?, .)) ? ? (??)) = ??(?(?, .)) 6 ?2? (? (?(?, .)) ? ? (??)) ,\n\nand therefore\n? (?(?, .)) ? ? (??) 6 ??2?? (? (?0) ? ? (??)) .\n\nThis inequality is the main result of this chapter and will be proved in Theorem 2.4.1.\nThe organization of this chapter is as follows. We first remind the reader in Section 2.2\n\nabout the basics of optimal transport theory and we prove two lemmas about the energies ?\nand ?? that will be used in the later sections. Section 2.3 will be devoted to the functional\ninequalities that we will prove in one dimension. In fact, in order to obtain our main result\nwe will follow closely the strategy developed for nonlinear diffusion equations in [8, 7, 26, 37,\n29, 25] to reduce the prove of the convergence to the proof of a Log-Sobolev type inequality.\nThis inequality is then proved as a consequence of the HWI inequality which crucially uses\nthe displacement convexity of the functionals involved. Finally, on section 2.4 we obtain\nthe rate of convergence towards equilibrium of the solutions to (2.1.1) by an approximation\nmethod using the construction of solutions in [20]. This convergence is proved for the energy\nof solutions and for the spaces ?1 and ?2.\n\nFinally, we point out that the problem of sharp convergence rates in several space dimen-\nsions is still open. Moreover, it could be interesting to prove or disprove analogous functional\ninequalities involving nonlocal operators in several space dimensions corresponding to the\nones established here in one dimension; see more comments at the end of Section 2. New\ntechniques or inequalities have to be developed. Showing asymptotic convergence when the\nconfining term ? \u00b7 (???) is replace by the general drift ? \u00b7 (??? ) is another interesting\nproblem, see [32, 25].\n\n2.2 Optimal transport results\n\nWe use optimal transport techniques to prove the Log-Sobolev, the Talagrand, and the\nHWI inequalities for both the energies ? and ?? for smooth probability measures ? ? ?2,??(R).\nTherefore, in order to make this chapter more self-contained, this section will be devoted to\nreview some results in optimal transport theory that shall be required later. The section\n\n36\n\n\n\nfinishes with some simple but new properties about the above mentioned energies.\nFirstly, let us define the metric that is going to be used on the probability space. The\n\nWasserstein distance ?2 on ?2(R) is defined for any ?1, ?2 ? ?2(R) by\n\n?2(?1, ?2) :=\n(?\n\ninf\n???(?1,?2)\n\n??\nR\u00d7R\n\n|? ? ?|2 ??(?, ?)\n)?1\n\n2\n\n,\n\nwhere ?(?1, ?2) be the set of all nonnegative Radon measures ? on R \u00d7 R such that\n\n?(? \u00d7 R) = ?1(?) and ?(R \u00d7 ?) = ?2(?), for all ?, ? ? R. (2.2.1)\n\nIf a measure ? satisfies (2.2.1) we say that it has marginals (projections) ?1 and ?2. The\ninfimum in the definition of ?2 is actually a minimum, and in the case we are dealing with\nin this chapter, it is unique and can be characterized by the following:\n\nTheorem 2.2.1 (see, for example, [78] for a proof). Given ?1, ?2 ? ?2(R) with ?1 absolutely\ncontinuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, there exists a Borel map ? ?2?1 : R ? R such\nthat ? ?2?1 #?1 = ?2, i.e.,??\n\nR\n?(?) ??2(?) =\n\n??\nR\n\n?(? ?2?1 (?)) ??1(?), for every ?2-integrable function ?,\n\nand ? ?2?1 also satisfies\n\n?2(?1, ?2) =\n(???\n\nR\n|? ? ? ?2?1 (?)|\n\n2 ??1(?)\n)?1\n\n2\n,\n\nIt is well known that the optimal map ? ?2?1 is nondecreasing on R and increasing on supp (?1).\nFurthermore, if ?1 and ?2 are, respectively, the cumulative distribution functions of ?1 and\n?2, defined by\n\n??(?) :=\n?? ?\n\n??\n??? = ??\n\n(?\n(??, ?]\n\n)?\n,\n\nthen we can write ? ?2?1 in terms of them, that is ?\n?2\n?1\n\n(?) = ? ?12 ? ?1(?).\n\nOne can use the previous theorem to define a very convenient set of curves in ?2,??(R) in\nthe following way: given ?0, ?1 ? ?2,??(R) and ? ?1?0 the optimal map such that ?\n\n?1\n?0\n\n#?0 = ?1,\nlet us write\n\n?? :=\n(?\n(1 ? ?)Id + ?? ?1?0\n\n)?\n#?0 , for all ? ? [0, 1].\n\n37\n\n\n\nThe curve (??)06?61 is called displacement interpolation between ?0 and ?1. It is not hard\nto see that ?? also belongs to ?2,??(R) for all ? ? [0, 1], and with this one can define the\nfollowing:\n\nDefinition 2.2.2. For a functional ? : ?2,??(R) ? (??, +?], we are going to say that\n\n\u2022 ? is displacement convex if, given any ?0, ?1 ? ?2,??(R) with (??)06?61 their displacement\ninterpolation, the function ? ?? ? (??) is convex on [0, 1].\n\n\u2022 ? is strictly displacement convex if ? ?? ? (??) is strictly convex on [0, 1].\n\n\u2022 ? is ?-displacement convex, for some ? ? R, if for all ? ? [0, 1]\n\n(1 ? ?)? (?0) + ?? (?1) ? ? (??) > ?\n?(1 ? ?)\n\n2\n?2(?0, ?1)2,\n\nor equivalentely\n?2\n\n??2\n? (??) > ??2(?0, ?1)2.\n\nSome of the functionals we are going to use in the rest of the chapter are combinations\nof the following ones:\n\n? (?) =\n??\nR\n\n?(?) log ?(?) ?? , (2.2.2)\n\n?(?) =\n1\n2\n\n??\nR\n\n?2 ??(?) and (2.2.3)\n\n??(?) =\n1\n2\n\n??\nR\n\n??\nR\n\n?1,?\n|? ? ?|1?2?\n\n??(?) ??(?) , (2.2.4)\n\nwhere we are committing an abuse of notation by identifying every absolutely continuous\nmeasure with its density. So we shall write ??(?) and ?(?)?? meaning the same thing\nthroughout the rest of the chapter. Therefore, we can write the energy functional ? as\n\n? (?) = ??(?) + ??(?)\n\nand besides this one, we are also going to need the following approximate functional: for\nevery ? > 0 and every measure ? ? ?2,??(R) we define:\n\n??(?) := ? (?) + ? ? (?) ,\n\n38\n\n\n\nand associated with it we have a respective energy dissipation\n\n??(?) :=\n??\nR\n\n???\n??(????)???(?) + ?? + ??? log ?(?)\n\n???2\n??(?) .\n\nThese two functionals are associated to the regularized equation (2.4.2) in the next section.\nThe metric ?2 on ?2(R) is related with a very known notion of convergence. We say that\n\nthe a sequence (??)??N ? ?2(R) is narrowly convergent to ? ? ?(R) (denoted by ?? ? ?) if\n\nlim\n???\n\n??\n?(?) ???(?) =\n\n??\n?(?) ??(?) , (2.2.5)\n\nfor all ? ? ??(R), the space of bounded and continuous functions.\nWith this definition in hand, we can characterize the notion of convergence in ?2(R):\n\nTheorem 2.2.3. The pair (?2(R), ?2) is a complete metric space and the convergence under\nthe distance ?2 is stronger than the convergence in the narrow sense. In fact, the following\nthree facts are equivalent for any (??)??N ? ?2(R) and ? ? ?(R):\n\n? ?2(??, ?) ? 0 as ? ? +?;\n\n? ?? ? ? and\nlim\n\n???\n\n??\n?2 ???(?) =\n\n??\n?2 ??(?);\n\n? ?? ? ? and\nlim\n\n???\nlim sup\n\n???\n\n??\n|?|>?\n\n?2 ???(?) = 0. (2.2.6)\n\nThe convergence in the narrow sense can be characterized using the notion of tightness\nof a set of measures. We say that a set ? ? ?(R) is tight if the following condition holds:\n\nfor all ? > 0 there exists a compact ?? ? R such that sup\n???\n\n?(R???) 6 ?. (2.2.7)\n\nThe condition (2.2.7) is equivalent to the following integral and easier-to-verify condition:\nthere exists ? : R ? [0, ?] such that\n\nfor all ? > 0, {? ? R | ?(?) 6 ?} is compact and sup\n???\n\n??\nR\n\n?(?) ??(?) &lt;? (2.2.8)\n\n39\n\n\n\nNow we can state the following Euclidean version of the Prokhorov\u2019s compactness theo-\nrem:\n\nTheorem 2.2.4 (Prokhorov). A set ? ? ?(R) is tight if and only if it is relatively compact\n(under the narrow convergence).\n\nFor a detailed proof of the above theorems and generalizations, the reader may check the\nstandard references [6], [78] (for the results involving the Wasserstein distance) and [38] (for\na proof of the Prokhorov\u2019s Theorem).\n\nLet us now prove a lemma that shall be used in the last section for the convergence in\nentropy of the solutions of the approximate problems. The proof uses similar arguments\ngiven in the Theorem 1.4 of [69].\n\nLemma 2.2.5. The entropy ?? is narrow lower semicontinuous and ?-displacement convex,\nfor all ?, ? > 0. In the case ? = 0, ?? is strictly displacement convex.\n\nProof. We already know from [59] that the functional ? is narrow lower semicontinuous and\nalso strictly displacement convex, so we just need to show the result for ? . For this, firstly\nlet us show the semicontinuity by writing the energy in the following way:\n\n? (?) =\n??\nR2\n\n? (?, ?) ??(?)??(?),\n\nwhere\n\n? (?, ?) =\n\n???\n??\n\n?\n\n4\n(?2 + ?2) +\n\n?1,?\n2\n\n1\n|? ? ?|1?2?\n\n, if ? ?= ?\n\n+? , if ? = ?\n.\n\nSince ? is non-negative and smooth outside the diagonal ? = ?, we can find a sequence\n{??}??N ? ??(R2) such that ??(?, ?) ? ? (?, ?) for all (?, ?) ? R2. Therefore, if {??}??N ?\n?2,??(R) is such ?? ? ? for some ? ? ?(R), by the monotone convergence theorem and the\nfact that ?? \u00d7 ?? ? ? \u00d7 ?, we have that\n\n? (?) =\n??\n\n? (?, ?) ??(?)??(?) = lim\n???\n\n??\n??(?, ?) ??(?)??(?)\n\n= lim\n???\n\nlim\n???\n\n??\n??(?, ?) ???(?)???(?) 6 lim inf\n\n???\n\n??\n? (?, ?) ???(?)???(?)\n\n= lim inf\n???\n\n? (??) .\n\n40\n\n\n\nNow, for the convexity property, we also know from [59] or [78] that the functional ??(?)\nis ?-displacement convex. Therefore we just need to show that ? is displacement convex.\nFor this, let ?0, ?1 ? ?2,??(R) and, to simplify the notation, ? := ? ?1?0 the optimal map given by\n(2.2.1) such that ?#?0 = ?1 and let (??)06?61 be their displacement interpolant. To simplify\nthe notation, let us call\n\n??(?) =\n?1,?\n\n|?|1?2?\n\nthe kernel of the Riesz potential. Then we have the following for each ? ? [0, 1]\n\n?(??) =\n1\n2\n\n?? ??\n??(? ? ?) ???(?)???(?)\n\n=\n1\n2\n\n?? ??\n??((1 ? ?)(? ? ?) + ?(?(?) ? ?(?))) ??0(?)??0(?). (2.2.9)\n\nAlso by (2.2.1) we know that ? is nondecreasing on R and increasing outside a set ? such\nthat ?0(? ) = 0. Therefore, for all ?, ? ? ? ? with ? ?= ? we have that ? ? ? and ?(?) ? ?(?)\nare both either on the negative or on the positive semi-line, where we can use the convexity\nof ?? and write\n\n??((1 ? ?)(? ? ?) + ?(?(?) ? ?(?))) 6 (1 ? ?)??(? ? ?) + ???(?(?) ? ?(?)). (2.2.10)\n\nThe only care we need to take is to avoid the singularity of the function ?? by proving that\n\n(1 ? ?)(? ? ?) + ?(?(?) ? ?(?)) ?= 0,\n\nfor all ? ? [0, 1] and forall ?, ? ? ? ? with ? ?= ?. For this, let us suppose that there exist\n?* ? (0, 1] and ?*, ?* ? ? ? with ?* ?= ?* such that\n\n(1 ? ?*)(?* ? ?*) + ?*(?(?*) ? ?(?*)) = 0, (2.2.11)\n\nthen we obtain that\n?(?*) ? ?(?*)\n\n?* ? ?*\n= ?\n\n1 ? ?*\n?*\n\n6 0,\n\nwhich contradicts the strict monotonicity of ?. If ?* = 0 then the only way to have (2.2.11)\n\n41\n\n\n\nis if ?* = ?*. Finally, from (2.2.9) and (2.2.10) we can deduce\n\n?(??) 6\n(1 ? ?)\n\n2\n\n?? ??\n??(? ? ?) ??0(?)??0(?) +\n\n?\n\n2\n\n?? ??\n??(?(?) ? ?(?)) ??0(?)??0(?)\n\n= (1 ? ?)?(?0) + ??(?1)\n\nwhich gives the displacement convexity of the functional ?.\n\nThe next lemma shows that the functional ?? also admits a unique minimum. This result\nis going to allow us to obtain the same desired asymptotic behavior for the solutions of the\napproximate problem.\n\nLemma 2.2.6. Let ?, ? > 0 and ?? := inf{??(?) | ? ? ?2(R)}. Then:\n\n1) ?? is finite;\n\n2) There exists a unique ??? ? ?2,??(R) such that ??(???) = ??.\n\nProof. Note that for every ? ? ?2,??(R) we have the following estimate:\n\n?? (?) +\n?\n\n2\n?(?) = ?\n\n??\n?(?) log ?(?) ?? +\n\n?\n\n4\n\n??\n?2?(?) ??\n\n= ?\n??\n\n?(?)\n{?\n\nlog ?(?) +\n?\n\n4?\n?2\n}?\n\n??\n\n= ?\n??\n\n?(?) log\n(?\n\n?(?)\n??\n\n?\n4? ?\n\n2\n\n)?\n??\n\n= ??\n??\n\n?(?)\n??\n\n?\n4? ?\n\n2 log\n(?\n\n?(?)\n??\n\n?\n4? ?\n\n2\n\n)?\n??\n\n?\n4? ?\n\n2\n\n?\n??, (2.2.12)\n\nwhere ? :=\n??\n\n??\n?\n4? ?\n\n2\n?? =\n\n??\n4??\n?\n\n. Therefore, since ? ?? ? log ? in convex, we can use the\nJensen\u2019s Inequality on the last expression and obtain\n\n??\n??\n\n?(?)\n??\n\n?\n4? ?\n\n2 log\n(?\n\n?(?)\n??\n\n?\n4? ?\n\n2\n\n)?\n??\n\n?\n4? ?\n\n2\n\n?\n?? > ??\n\n(???\n?(?)\n?\n\n??\n\n)?\nlog\n\n(???\n?(?)\n?\n\n??\n\n)?\n\n= ? log\n1\n\n?\n= ? log\n\n?\n\n4??\n. (2.2.13)\n\n42\n\n\n\nIn particular, this also implies that for all ? ? ?2,??(R):\n\n??(?) > ??

By the inequalities (2.2.12)\nand (2.2.13) above, we have the following estimate for the second moments\n\n0 6\n?\n\n4\n\n??\n?2??(?) ??\n\n=\n?\n\n2\n?(??)\n\n6 ??

It is easy\nto check that ?* ? ?2(R) for, by the Lemma 2.2.5, we know that\n\n??(?*) 6 lim inf\n??N\n\n??(??) = ? &lt;?,\n\nwhich means that ?* ? ?(??) ? ?2(R) and that ?* is a minimum for ??.\n\nThe uniqueness of the ground state follows from the Lemma 2.2.5 for, if ?1* and ?2* are\ntwo different minimums in ?2,??(R) to ?? we can define ? 1\n\n2\n= ( 12 ?? +\n\n1\n2 ?)#?\n\n1\n*, where ? := ?\n\n?2*\n?1*\n\n,\nthe optimal transport map ? ?\n\n2\n*\n\n?1*\n#?1* = ?2*.

If ? = 0, we also know from the Lemma 2.2.5 that ??\nis strictly displacement convex, and in this case we also obtain\n\n??(? 1\n2\n)&lt;\n\n1\n2\n\n??(?1*) +\n1\n2\n\n??(?2*) = ?.\n\nTherefore, there exists a unique ground state for ??.\n\n2.3 Transport inequalities in dimension 1\n\nWe know from Section 2.1 that ? (??) is the minimum value for the energy ? and therefore,\nwe can use the difference ? (?) ? ? (??) as a measure of distance between any ? ? ?2,??(R)\nand the ground state ??. So in this section, we are going to derive several inequalities\noriginated from optimal transportation theory that will be used in the next section to show\nthe exponential convergence of ? (?) ? ? (??) to zero in dimension one.\n\nWe also know from the relation (2.1.10) that, once we have the following inequality for a\nsufficiently large class of functions\n\n? (?) ? ? (??) 6\n1\n\n2?\n?(?), (2.3.1)\n\nwe can prove the exponential convergence of ? (?) ? ? (??) to zero with exponential rate ?2?\n(but not necessarily the exponential convergence of ?(?)).\n\nThe inequality (2.3.1) is usually called, in the context of optimal transport, Log-Sobolev\ninequality in the linear diffusion case or generalized Log-Sobolev inequalities otherwise. We\nwill revisit (2.3.1) in the next section by investigating the displacement convexity of the\nenergy ? (?). In particular, it becomes the logarithmic Sobolev inequality [46] for linear\nFokker-Planck equation [7, 28, 73], and a special family of Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequalities\nfor nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations with porous medium type diffusion [37, 26, 29].\n\nThus for the rest of this section, we shall prove a generalization of (2.3.1) and use it in\nthe following section to obtain the desired decay for ? (?) ? ? (??).\n\nNow, let us begin with the following technical lemma about the derivative of the Riesz\npotential.\n\n44\n\n\n\nLemma 2.3.1. Let 0 &lt;? 6 1 and ? ? ?1(R) ? ??(R) ? ? ?(R) with ? > max(1 ? 2?, 0).\nThen (????)??? ? ? 1(R) and for any ? ? R,\n\n??(????)???(?) = ??1,?(1 ? 2?)\n??\nR\n\n? ? ?\n|? ? ?|3?2?\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n)?\n?? , if ? ?

(1/2, 1].\n\nProof. Firstly, let us assume that ? ? (0, 1/2). To simplify the notation, we write ??(?) :=\n?1,?|?|2??1. Hence, we note that under the hypothesis on ?, we have that\n\nu?(?) := ??1,?(1 ? 2?)\n??\nR\n\n(? ? ?)\n|? ? ?|3?2?\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n)?\n?? = ??? * (? ? ?(?))\n\nis well defined for all ? ? R.\nNow, let ? ? ? 1(R) be a radial function such that 0 6 ? 6 1, ?(?) = 0 if |?| 6 1, ?(?) = 1\n\nif |?| > 2 and |??| 6 2. Define ??(?) := ?(??1?) and\n\n?(?) := (????)???(?) = ?? * ?(?) ,\n??(?) := (????) * ?(?).\n\nSince ? is bounded, we have that ?? ? ? uniformly on R as ? ? 0 for\n\n|?(?) ? ??(?)| 6\n??\n\n|???|62?\n??(? ? ?)\n\n(?\n1 ? ??(? ? ?)\n\n)?\n?(?) ??\n\n6 ????\n??\n\n|?|62?\n\n1\n|?|1?2?\n\n?? = ??????2?\n\nfor all ? ? R, where ? depends on ?.\nBy the smoothness of ???? we know that ?? ? ? 1 and ???(?) = (????)? * ?(?), and since\n\n???? is radial, we can write\n\n???(?) =\n??\nR\n(????)?(? ? ?)\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n)?\n?? .\n\n45\n\n\n\nTherefore,\n\n|u?(?) ? ???(?)| =\n????\n?\n??\n\n|???|62?\n(??(1 ? ??))?(? ? ?)\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n)?\n??\n\n????\n?\n\n6\n??\n\n|???|62?\n\n(?\n|???(? ? ?)||1 ? ??(? ? ?)| + ??(? ? ?)|?\n\n?\n?(? ? ?)|\n\n)?????\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n????\n??\n\n6\n??\n\n|???|62?\n\n(?\n?1,?(1 ? 2?)\n|? ? ?|2?2?\n\n+\n2\n?\n\n?1,?\n|? ? ?|1?2?\n\n)?????\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n????\n?? (2.3.2)\n\n6 ?\n??\n\n|???|62?\n\n(?\n1\n\n|? ? ?|2?2???\n+\n\n1\n?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|1?2???\n\n)?\n??\n\n6 ?1?\n?+2??1,\n\nwhere the constant ?1 only depends on ?, ? and on the H\u00f6lder constant of ?. Thus, we also\nhave that ??? converges uniformly to u? as ? ? 0, and therefore ?? = u?.\n\nNow, if ? ? (1/2, 1] , we only need to adapt the argument in formula (2.3.2) for the\nfunction\n\nu?(?) := ??1,?(1 ? 2?)\n??\nR\n\n? ? ?\n|? ? ?|3?2?\n\n?(?) ?? = ??? * ?\n\nand using that ??? = (????)? * ? in the following way\n\n|u?(?) ? ???(?)| = ? ????\n??\n\n|???|62?\n\n(?\n1\n\n|? ? ?|2?2?\n+\n\n1\n?\n\n1\n|? ? ?|1?2?\n\n)?\n??\n\n= ?2?2??1,\n\nwhere the constant ?2 only depends on ? and on the ?? norm of ?.\n\nFinally, if ? = 1/2 we have that\n\n(????)?\n1\n2 ?(?) = ?1, 12\n\n??\nR\n\nlog |? ? ?|?(?) ??\n\nand\nu 1\n\n2\n(?) = ??1, 12\n\n??\nR\n\n(? ? ?)\n|? ? ?|2\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n)?\n??.\n\nArguing as above for ? 1\n2\n(?) := ?1, 12 log |?| we arrive at the following estimates:\n\n|?(?) ? ??(?)| 6 ????\n??\n\n|?|62?\n\n???\nlog |?|\n\n???\n?? = ??????\n\n(????\nlog 2?\n\n???\n+ 1\n\n)?\n\n46\n\n\n\nand\n\n|u 1\n2\n(?) ? ???(?)| 6 ?\n\n??\n|???|62?\n\n(? 1\n|? ? ?|\n\n+\n1\n?\n\n???\nlog |? ? ?|\n\n???)?????\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n????\n??\n\n6 ?\n??\n\n|???|62?\n\n(? 1\n|? ? ?|1??\n\n+\n1\n?\n\n|? ? ?|?\n???\nlog |? ? ?|\n\n???)?\n??\n\n6 ???\n(?\n\n1 + ? + ?\n???\nlog 2?\n\n???)?\n.\n\nTherefore, since all these estimates are uniform in ?, we conclude that the lemma is true for\nall ? ? (0, 1].\n\nRemark 2.3.2. With this expression for the derivative of (????)??? for ? &lt;12 , we obtain\nthe following equality that shall be used in the next proposition:\n\n??(????)???(?)\n?1,?(2? ? 1)\n\n= lim\n??0\n\n??\n|???|>?\n\n? ? ?\n|? ? ?|3?2?\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n)?\n??\n\n= lim\n??0\n\n??\n|???|>?\n\n? ? ?\n|? ? ?|3?2?\n\n?(?) ?? ? lim\n??0\n\n?(?)\n??\n\n|???|>?\n\n? ? ?\n|? ? ?|3?2?\n\n??\n\n= lim\n??0\n\n??\n|???|>?\n\n? ? ?\n|? ? ?|3?2?\n\n?(?) ??,\n\nwhere we only used the fact that ?? is radial and ??? is integrable at the infinity. For ? >\n1\n2 ,\n\nthe expression is valid without taking the limit, as the kernel is locally integrable.\n\nThe generalization of (2.3.1) that we are going to show is the so called HWI inequality\nwhich is called so because it was first established in [64] and it relates the relative Kullback\ninformation (denoted by ?), the Wasserstein distance ?2 and the relative Fisher information\n(also denoted by ?).\n\nThe next theorems show that the HWI inequality holds for ? and ?? at least for a class of\nbounded and H\u00f6lder continuous functions on R. The proof follows the arguments given in [54]\nwhere the same inequality is proved for the case of the logarithmic interaction (? = 1/2) and\nstrongly relies on the fact that the optimal transport map with respect to the Wasserstein\ndistance is a monotone nondecreasing function on R. We point out that the convexity of the\nconfinement due to the drift measured by ? > 0 appears explicitly in the inequalities as in\n[25].\n\nTheorem 2.3.3. Let ? ? (0, 1], ? ? R and ? ? ?2,??(R) such that its density (also denoted\n\n47\n\n\n\nby ?) satisfies ? ? ??(R) ? ? ?(R) with ? > max(1 ? 2?, 0). Then, if ?? the minimum point\nof ? on ?2(R), we have\n\n? (?) ? ? (??) 6\n??\n\n?(?)?2(?, ??) ?\n?\n\n2\n? 22 (?, ??).\n\nProof. For ? = 1/2 this result was proven at [54]. So, let us suppose that ? ? (0, 1/2) and,\nto simplify, let us denote ??(?) = ??(????)???(?). Since ? is absolutely continuous with\nrespect to the Lebesgue measure, by Theorem 2.2.1 there exists an nondecreasing transport\nmap ? ??? such that ? ??? #? = ??. In order to simplify the notation let us call ? := ? ??? .\n\nThen, we can write\n\n??\n?(?)?2(?, ??) ?\n\n?\n\n2\n? 22 (?, ??) ? ? (?) + ? (??) = ?1 + ?2 + ?3 ,\n\nwhere\n\n?1 :=\n(??? ????\n\n??(?) + ??\n????2\n\n??(?)\n)?1/2 (???\n\n|? ? ?(?)|2??(?)\n)?1/2\n\n?\n?? (?\n\n??(?) + ??\n)?\n\n(? ? ?(?)) ??(?)\n\n?2 :=\n?? {?\n\n??(? ? ?(?)) ?\n?\n\n2\n?2 +\n\n?\n\n2\n?(?)2 ?\n\n?\n\n2\n|? ? ?(?)|2\n\n}?\n??(?)\n\n?3 :=\n?1,?\n2\n\n??\n??(?)??(?)\n\n|?(?) ? ?(?)|1?2?\n?\n\n?1,?\n2\n\n??\n??(?)??(?)\n|? ? ?|1?2?\n\n?\n??\n\n??(?)(?(?) ? ?)??(?) ,\n\nwhere we added and subtracted several terms. This allows us to show that ?1 > 0 by the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality and ?2 = 0 for all ? ? R. Now, for ?3 let us call ??(?) = ?1,?|?|2??1.\nThen, by the Remark 2.3.2\n\n??(?) = lim\n??0\n\n??\n|???|>?\n\n???(? ? ?)??(?).\n\nAnd, since ???(?) = ????(??), we can write??\n??(?)\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?\n\n)?\n??(?)\n\n= lim\n??0\n\n??\n|???|>?\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?\n\n)?\n???\n(?\n? ? ?\n\n)?\n??(?)??(?)\n\n48\n\n\n\n=\n1\n2\n\nlim\n??0\n\n??\n|???|>?\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?(?) ? ? + ?)???\n\n(?\n? ? ?\n\n)?\n??(?)??(?).\n\nFurthermore,\n?1,?\n\n??\n??(?)??(?)\n|? ? ?|1?2?\n\n= lim\n??0\n\n??\n|???|>?\n\n??(? ? ?)??(?)??(?)\n\n?1,?\n\n??\n??(?)??(?)\n\n|?(?) ? ?(?)|1?2?\n= lim\n\n??0\n\n??\n|???|>?\n\n??(?(?) ? ?(?))??(?)??(?)\n\nand then,\n\n?3 = lim\n??0\n\n1\n2\n\n?? {?\n??\n(?\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n)?\n? ??(? ? ?) ? ???\n\n(?\n?(?) ? ?(?)\n\n)?(?\n?(?) ? ?(?) ? ? + ?\n\n)?}?\n??(?)??(?).\n\nThe integrand is nonnegative by the convexity of ?? on the positive real line and by the\nmonotonicity of ?, so ?3 > 0 as well.\n\nIf ? ? (1/2, 1], we still have ??(?) = ?1,?|?|2??1 convex because ?1,? is negative in this\nrange. Thus, the previous computations still apply.\n\nRemarks. 1) It is known that, if the HWI inequality holds for some ? > 0, then the Log-\nSobolev inequality also holds. One just needs to maximize the right-hand side for ?2 > 0 or\nuse the Young\u2019s inequality for (??\n\n1\n2\n?\n\n?)(?\n1\n2 ?2). Then we have that\n\n? (?) ? ? (??) 6\n1\n\n2?\n?(?), (2.3.3)\n\nfor all ? satisfying the assumptions of the theorem above.\n2) Note that in the proof of the Theorem 2.3.3 we did not use the fact that ?? is the\n\nminimum of ? , only the fact that ? (??) &lt;?. In fact, the same inequality holds for any\n?0 in the place of ?? as long as ?0 ? ?(? ), and also with ?? in the place of ?, since ?? is\nabsolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, which allows the existence of\nthe map ? by the Theorem 2.2.1 from page 37. Therefore, if we exchange ? and ?? in the\nHWI we obtain the fractional version of the so called Talagrand inequality or transportation\ncost inequality\n\n?2(?, ??) 6\n??\n\n2\n?\n\n(?\n? (?) ? ? (??)\n\n)?\n. (2.3.4)\n\nWe can derive similar results for the ? functionals.\n\nTheorem 2.3.4. Let ? ? (0, 1], ? > 0, 0 &lt;? &lt;?/2?, ? ? ?2,??(R) such that its density (also\n\n49\n\n\n\ndenoted by ?) satisfies ? ? ??(R) ? ? ?(R) with ? > max(1 ? 2?, 0), and ??? the minimum\npoint of ?? on ?2(R). Then\n\n??(?) ? ??(???) 6\n??\n\n??(?)?2(?, ???) ?\n?\n\n2\n? 22 (?, ?\n\n?\n?).\n\nProof. The proof is basically the same, but since we have a new term inside the respective\ndiffusion, we shall include it for completeness.\n\nAs in the previous theorem, let ??(?) = ??(????)???(?) and ? be such that ?#? = ???.\nThen, we decompose the inequality as\n\n??\n??(?)?2(?, ???) ?\n\n?\n\n2\n? 22 (?, ?\n\n?\n?) ? ??(?) + ??(?\n\n?\n?) = ?1 + ?2 + ?3; ,\n\nwhere\n\n?1 :=\n(??? ????\n\n??(?) + ?? + ??? log ?(?)\n????2\n\n??(?)\n)?1/2 (???\n\n|? ? ?(?)|2??(?)\n)?1/2\n\n?\n?? (?\n\n??(?) + ?? + ??? log ?(?)\n)?\n\n(? ? ?(?)) ??(?); ,\n\n?2 := ?\n?? (?\n\n??? log ?(?) + ??\n)?\n\n(?(?) ? ?) ?? ?\n?? (?\n\n?\n\n2\n?2 + ? log ?\n\n)?\n??\n\n+\n?? (?\n\n?\n\n2\n?2 + ? log ???\n\n)?\n???? ?\n\n?\n\n2\n\n??\n|? ? ?(?)|2??(?)\n\nand\n\n?3 :=\n?1,?\n2\n\n??\n??(?)??(?)\n\n|?(?) ? ?(?)|1?2?\n?\n\n?1,?\n2\n\n??\n??(?)??(?)\n|? ? ?|1?2?\n\n?\n??\n\n??(?)(?(?) ? ?)??(?).\n\nBy the same arguments, we conclude that ?1, ?3 > 0. Now, for ?2, let us define the\nfollowing functional\n\n?(? |?) :=\n??\n\n? (?) log\n(?\n\n? (?)\n?(?)\n\n)?\n??\n\nfor all nonnegative ?, ? ? ?1(R) with ? > 0. Then we can re-write ?2 in the following way\n\n?2 =\n\n50\n\n\n\n?\n\n(?\n?\n??\n\n?? log\n(?\n\n?(?)\n????\n\n2\n\n)?\n(?(?) ? ?) ??(?) ? ?(?|????\n\n2\n) + ?(???|?\n\n???2 ) + ?\n??\n\n|?(?) ? ?|2 ??\n)?\n\n+\n(?\n\n1 ?\n2?\n?\n\n?\n)??? {?\n\n???(?(?) ? ?) ?\n?\n\n2\n?2 +\n\n?\n\n2\n?(?)2 +\n\n?\n\n2\n(?(?) ? ?)2\n\n}?\n??(?).\n\nNote that the second line is equal to (? ? 2??)\n??\n\n|?(?) ? ?|2 ??, which is nonnegative\nfor ? &lt;?/2?. For the first line, we can use the proof of the HWI inequality made in [64].\nActually, Otto and Villani showed that whenever ?, ??? ? ? ?? (R) ? ?(R) and ? ? ? 2(R) is\nsuch that\n\n??\n??? ?? = 1 and ? ?? > ? for some constant ? ? R, then\n\n?(???|?\n?? ) ? ?(?|??? ) ?\n\n??\n?? log\n\n?(?)\n??? (?)\n\n(?(?) ? ?)?(?) ?? ?\n?\n\n2\n\n??\n|?(?) ? ?|2?(?) ?? > 0,\n\nand for the density argument given in the proof of the Theorem 9.17 of [78], we have that\nthis inequality holds for all ?, ??? ? ?1(R) ? ?2(R). So, applying this for ? (?) = ??2 we have\nthat ? = 2? and we conclude that ?2 > 0.\n\nRemark 2.3.5. By the same arguments given for (2.3.3) and (2.3.4), we conclude that\nthe following Log-Sobolev and Talagrand inequalities hold for ??, as long as ? satisfies the\nassumptions of proposition 2.3.4:\n\n??(?) ? ??(???) 6\n1\n\n2?\n??(?), (2.3.5)\n\n?2(?, ???) 6\n??\n\n2\n?\n\n(?\n??(?) ? ??(???)\n\n)?\n.\n\nRemark 2.3.6. These results also work for a general confinement potential ? : R ? R\ninstead of the quadratic one ?2 ?\n\n2, as long as ? ? ?2 ?\n2 is convex.\n\n2.4 Exponential Convergence\n\nIn this section we shall prove that the energy of the solution decays exponentially fast\nfor the regularized equation with mollified initial data, and then passing the limit on these\nregularizing parameters we shall be able to prove the same property for the original problem.\nWe conclude the section showing that this exponential decay in the energy implies also a\nexponential convergence in ?2(R).\n\n51\n\n\n\nLet us begin stating our main result.\n\nTheorem 2.4.1. Let ?0 ? ?1(R) ? ??(R) such that\n\n0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| ,\n\nfor some constants ?, ? > 0. Then, for each 0 &lt;? &lt;1/2, the solution ?(?, \u00b7) of (2.1.1) with\ninitial data ?0 satisfies\n\n? (?(?)) ? ? (??) 6 ??2??\n(?\n\n? (?0) ? ? (??)\n)?\n\n.\n\nWe could try to prove this theorem directly since we know from the previous section\nthat the respective Log-Sobolev inequality holds for the energy ? and then, using the re-\nlation (2.1.10) the result would follow by the Gronwall\u2019s inequality. The only problem of\nmaking this argument fully rigorous is that both results demand some smoothness from the\nsolution and a classic regularity theory for the equation (2.1.1) is still an open problem. In\nspite of the result proved in [19] that the weak solutions are H\u00f6lder continuous, no esti-\nmate was given for the H\u00f6lder exponent, and since the Theorem 2.3.3, and consequently the\nLog-Sobolev inequality (2.3.3), is valid only for measures whose density belongs to ? ? with\n? > 1 ? 2?, the argument above cannot be implemented at the moment. One possible way\nof circumventing this regularity issue would be extending the class of measures for which the\nHWI inequality holds, but this requires passing limits in the argument of the dissipation term\n?, which is delicate, specially for two reasons: firstly because it is still not clear for which\nset of measures ? the quantity ?(?) is finite; and secondly, the dissipation is, in general, only\nlower semicontinuous, which makes the approximation process hard to implement since this\nfunctional appears on the right hand side of both HWI and Log-Sobolev inequalities. There-\nfore, in order to prove the theorem above we will proceed by an approximation argument as\nfollows: first we will obtain a similar result for an approximate version of the equation (2.1.1)\nwith an small extra linear diffusion for which we have a good regularity result, and then pass\nthe limit on the respective exponential decay as this small diffusion term goes to zero. This\napproximate equation was also used in [20] to show the existence of weak solutions of the\nequation (2.1.2).\n\nProof of Theorem 2.4.1. In order to use the results of Section 2.3, firstly we shall assume\n\n52\n\n\n\nthat\n?0 ? ? ?(R) and\n\n??\nR\n\n?0(?) ?? = 1. (2.4.1)\n\nLet ??, ??? ? ?(R) be the minimizers for ? and ?? respectively. By the assumption on ?0 we\nknow from the proofs of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 in [20] that the solutions ? and ?? to\n\n??\n? ??? = ??(???(????)\n\n??? + ???) , in R \u00d7 (0, ?)\n?(0) = ?0 , in R,\n\n(2.4.2)\n\nand ??\n? ???\n\n? = ??(????(????)???? + ????) + ?????? , in R \u00d7 (0, ?)\n??(0) = ?0 , in R\n\n(2.4.3)\n\nsatisfy ? ? ?([0, ?); ?1(R)) and ?? ? ? 1((0, ?) \u00d7 R) for all ? > 0 sufficiently small. It is\nalso proved in the above mentioned reference that, because of the ?-regularization in (2.4.3)\nwith a heat term, ??(?, .) is in fact in ? 2(R) for all fixed time ? > 0, and moreover, there exist\n?(?), ?(?) > 0, such that\n\n0 6 ?(?, ?) , ??(?, ?) 6 ?(?)???(?)|?|. (2.4.4)\n\nThe energy ?? is related to the equation (2.4.3) in the same way as ? is related to (2.4.2).\nFor example, in both cases the respective energy is nonincreasing with respect to the time\nand the steady state solutions coincide with the minimums of the energies.\n\nSince ??(?) is smooth, we can apply the Log-Sobolev Inequality (2.3.5) for ?? and obtain\nthat for all ? > 0,\n\n??(??(?)) ? ??(???) 6\n1\n\n2?\n??(??(?)).\n\nFurthermore, making use of the fact that\n\n?\n\n??\n??(??(?)) = ???(??(?)), (2.4.5)\n\nwe conclude that\n??(??(?)) ? ??(???) 6 ?\n\n?2??\n(?\n\n??(?0) ? ??(???)\n)?\n\n. (2.4.6)\n\nThe equality (2.4.5) is easy to show in this case for ??(?) is a classical solution to (2.4.3)\nwhich decays to zero at infinity and hence, defining ?? = ? log ? + ?2 ?\n\n2 + ?? * ? to simplify the\n\n53\n\n\n\nnotation, we can write the equation as ???? = ??(??????) and we can compute\n\n?\n\n??\n??(??) =\n\n?? (?\n? log ?????? +\n\n?\n\n2\n?2???\n\n? + ????\n??\n2\n\n* ?? + ??\n??\n2\n\n* ????\n)?\n\n??\n\n=\n?? (?\n\n? log ?? +\n?\n\n2\n?2 + ?? * ??\n\n)?\n???\n\n? ??\n\n=\n??\n\n??(?)??(??(?)????(?)) ??\n\n= ?\n??\n\n??(?)|????(?)|2 ??\n\n= ??(??).\n\nNow, in order to obtain the desired inequality for the original functional ? we need to\ntake the limits as ? ? 0+ in (2.4.6). For this, let us analyze each one of the three terms\non (2.4.6) separately:\n\ni) The easiest one is the limit ??(?0), since lim\n??0+\n\n??(?0) = ? (?0) holds as long as ? (?0) &lt;?\nfor some, which is true by the assumptions on ?0.\n\nii) For the term ??(???), let us first define the following auxiliary functional on ?2,??(R):\n\n?(?) := ?(?|????\n2\n) = ?\n\n??\n?2? +\n\n??\n? log ?.\n\nSince\n??\n\n????\n2\n?? = 1, we can write\n\n?(?) =\n??\n\n?\n\n????\n2 log\n\n(?\n?\n\n????\n2\n\n)?\n????\n\n2\n?? =\n\n?? [?\n?\n\n????\n2 log\n\n(?\n?\n\n????\n2\n\n)?\n?\n\n?\n\n????\n2 + 1\n\n]?\n????\n\n2\n??,\n\nwhich is nonnegative since the function ? ?? ? log ? ? ? + 1 is nonnegative as well.\n\nLet us prove that lim sup??0 ??(???) 6 ? (??). Using the fact that ??? is the minimum\nfor ??, we obtain the following inequality\n\n??(???) 6 ??(??) = ? (??) + ?\n??\n\n?? log ??. (2.4.7)\n\nBy the characterization of the minimum ?? in [21, 32], we know that ?? ? ? 2??(R) ?\n??(R), and hence the second term on the right hand side of (2.4.7) is finite. Thus, we\ncan take the limit ? ? 0 and obtain that lim sup??0+ ??(???) 6 ? (??).\n\n54\n\n\n\nFor the opposite inequality lim inf ??0+ ??(???) > ? (??), we can use the fact that ?? is\nthe minimum for ? and write\n\n? (??) 6 ? (???)\n\n= ??(???) + ?? (?\n?\n?) ? ?\n\n(?\n? (???) + ?\n\n??\n?2???\n\n)?\n+ ??\n\n??\n?2???\n\n= ??(???) ? ??(?\n?\n?) + ??\n\n??\n?2???\n\n6 ??(???) + ??\n??\n\n?2???. (2.4.8)\n\nSo, it is sufficient to prove that the second moments of ??? are uniformly bounded for\n? > 0 sufficiently small. For this, note that for all 0 &lt;? &lt;min{?/4?, 1} we have\n\n0 6\n?\n\n4\n\n??\n?2??? =\n\n?\n\n2\n?(???)\n\n6\n?\n\n2\n?(???) + ??(?\n\n?\n?)\n\n=\n?\n\n2\n?(???) + 2???(?\n\n?\n?) + ? ? (?\n\n?\n?)\n\n6 ??(???) + ? ? (?\n?\n?) + ?(?\n\n?\n?)\n\n= ??(???) 6 ??(??) 6 ? (??) +\n??????\n\n?? log ??\n????\n.\n\nTherefore, taking the limit as ? ? 0+ in (2.4.8) we obtain\n\n? (??) 6 lim inf\n??0+\n\n??(???) + lim\n??0+\n\n??\n??\n\n?2??? = lim inf\n??0+\n\n??(???).\n\nHence, as ? goes to zero from above, we have that the minimum of ??(?) indeed converge\nto the minimum of ? (?), i.e., ? (??) = lim\n\n??0+\n??(???).\n\niii) Finally, let us prove that ? (?(?)) 6 lim inf ??0+ ??(??(?)) as a consequence of the con-\nvergence of ??(?) to ?(?) in ?2,??(R) and the lower semi-continuity of the energy ??. For\nthis we can use the bound (2.4.4) to obtain\n\nlim\n???\n\nsup\n??N\n\n??\n|?|>?\n\n??? (?, ?)?? 6 lim\n???\n\n?(?)\n??\n\n|?|>?\n???(?)|?|?? = 0,\n\nfor every sequence ?? ? 0, which means that ??? (?) is a tight family of probability\n\n55\n\n\n\nmeasures and by Prokhorov\u2019s Theorem 2.2.4, there exist a subsequence, still denoted\nby ??, that such that ??? (?) ? ?(?), i.e.,\n\n??\nR\n\n?(?)??? (?, ?) ?? ?\n??\nR\n\n?(?)?(?, ?) ?? , for all ? ? ??(R) (2.4.9)\n\nMoreover, due to uniform exponential bound, we also have that\n\nlim\n???\n\nsup\n??N\n\n??\n|?|>?\n\n?2??? (?, ?)?? 6 lim\n???\n\n?(?)\n??\n\n|?|>?\n?2???(?)|?|?? = 0. (2.4.10)\n\nTherefore, by (2.2.6) from the Theorem 2.2.3 we have that (2.4.9) and (2.4.10) imply\nthat ??? (?) converges to ?(?) in (?2(R), ?2). Note that, by (2.4.4), the second moments\nare uniformly bounded w. r. t. ? so, from the following inequality\n\n? (??? (?)) = ??? (?\n?? (?)) ? ???(??? (?)) + ???\n\n??\n?2??? (?, ?) 6 ??? (?\n\n?? ) + ???\n??\n\n?2??? (?, ?),\n\nand by the fact that ? is lower semi-continuous in (?2(R), ?2), we obtain\n\n? (?(?)) 6 lim inf\n???\n\n? (??? (?)) 6 lim inf\n???\n\n??? (?\n?? (?)).\n\nPutting all the limits together as ? goes to zero, we can conclude the exponential convergence\nof ? (?(?)) ? ? (??), that is,\n\n? (?(?)) ? ? (??) 6 lim inf\n???\n\n??? (?\n?? (?)) ? lim\n\n???\n??? (?\n\n??\n? )\n\n= lim inf\n???\n\n(?\n??? (?\n\n?? (?)) ? ??? (?\n??\n? )\n)?\n\n6 ??2?? lim inf\n???\n\n(?\n??? (?0) ? ??? (?\n\n?\n?)\n)?\n\n= ??2??\n(?\n\n? (?0) ? ? (??)\n)?\n\n.\n\nIf the regularity assumption in (2.4.1) is not true, we can proceed the above argument\nwith the mollified initial data ?0,? = ?? * ?0, which has the same bound and mass as ?0. Since\nwe still have the same exponential bounds for the respective solutions ??(?), we can argue as\nabove and conclude that ? (?(?)) 6 lim inf ??0 ? (??(?)) holds for all ? > 0. For ? = 0 we can\nuse the exponential bound of the initial data and the Dominated Convergence Theorem to\nconclude that lim??0 ? (??,0) = ? (?0).\n\n56\n\n\n\nAs a direct consequence of the Talagrand inequality in (2.3.4), we also obtain the expo-\nnential decay in Wasserstein distance.\n\nCorollary 2.4.2. Assume that ?0 satisfies 0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| for all ? ? R and some\n?, ? > 0. Then, for each 0 &lt;? &lt;1/2, the solution of (2.1.1) with initial data ?0 satisfies\n\n?2(?(?), ??) 6 ????\n??\n\n2\n?\n\n(?\n? (?0) ? ? (??)\n\n)?\n.\n\nFor the Fokker-Planck equation or the classic Porous Medium Equations, exponential\nconvergence of the relative entropy ? (?) ? ? (??) implies convergence of ? to the steady\nstates ?? in some classical ?? norms, using for this the classical Csisz\u00e1r-Kullback-Pinsker\ninequality as in [7, 29]. Here we can show that the convergence in the relative entropy implies\nthe convergence of the norm ?(????)?\n\n?\n2 (? ? ??)??2 .\n\nLemma 2.4.3. Let ?? be the unique minimizer of ? , then for any ? ? ?2(R),\n\n1\n2\n\n?(????)?\n?\n2 (? ? ??)?2?2 ? ? (?) ? ? (??).\n\nProof. The characterization (2.1.13a) and (2.1.13b) of the global minimizer ?? and the non-\nnegativity of ? ? ?? outside of the support of ?? imply that\n\n0 = ?*\n??\nR\n(? ? ??) ?\n\n??\nR\n\n(?\n(??)????(?) + ?\n\n|?2|\n2\n\n)?\n(? ? ??).\n\nTherefore, we deduce\n\n? (?) ? ? (??) =\n1\n2\n\n??\nR\n\n?(????)??? ?\n1\n2\n\n??\nR\n\n?(????)???? +\n?\n\n2\n\n??\nR\n\n|?|2(? ? ??)\n\n?\n1\n2\n\n??\nR\n\n?(????)??? ?\n1\n2\n\n??\nR\n\n?(????)???? ?\n??\nR\n(? ? ??)(????)????\n\n=\n1\n2\n\n??\nR\n(? ? ??)(????)??(? ? ??) =\n\n1\n2\n\n?(????)?\n?\n2 (? ? ??)?2?2 .\n\nSince ?(????)?\n?\n2 (? ? ??)??2 is the ? ??/2-norm of ? ? ??, it is unlikely to produce a\n\nbound on any stronger ?? norm for the difference ? ? ??. One way to show the exponential\nconvergence of ?(?) to ?? is to assume a uniform bound on a higher order norm of ? ? ??.\n\n57\n\n\n\nFor example, if ?(????)\n?\n2 (? ? ??)??2 is uniformly bounded, then we have (easy to establish\n\nin Fourier space)\n\n?? ? ???2?2 ? ?(????)\n?\n2 (? ? ??)??2 ?(????)?\n\n?\n2 (? ? ??)??2\n\nand ?? ? ????2 converges to zero also exponentially fast, but with a smaller rate.\nLet us prove that in fact the exponential convergence also holds in ?2 without any addi-\n\ntional hypothesis. For this, since (????)?\n?\n2 ? usually has more regularity than ?, we need to\n\nlook for an interpolation inequality containing some sort of fractional differentiation, which in\nour case, it seems natural to be a H\u00f6lder semi-norm, i.e., for every ? ? (0, 1] and ? ? ? ?(R)\nwe denote the ?-H\u00f6lder semi-norm of ? by\n\n[?]?? := sup\n? ?=?\n\n|?(?) ? ?(?)|\n|? ? ?|?\n\n.\n\nTherefore, to obtain the desired decay in ?2 we shall use the following new interpolation\ninequality, that we will prove for any dimension ? > 1. The idea for this result was given by\nCarrillo and V\u00e1zquez.\n\nTheorem 2.4.4. Let 0 &lt;? 6 1 and 0 &lt;? &lt;?/2 and 0 &lt;? &lt;?/2.

For all 0 &lt;? &lt;?/2, ? > 0 and ?1 = ?/(? + ?), we can use Fourier\nvariables, Plancherel\u2019s formula, the H\u00f6lder\u2019s inequality with the conjugate pair\n\n(?\n1\n\n?1\n, 11??1\n\n)?\nand (2.4.12) to interpolate between [?]? ? and (??)?\n\n?\n2 ? ? ?2(R?) obtaining\n\n???2?2 =\n??\nR?\n\n|???(?)|2 ?? = ??\nR?\n\n|???(?)|2?1 |?|?2??1 |???(?)|2(1??1)|?|2?(1??1)??\n6\n(???\n\nR?\n|???(?)|2|?|?2???)??1 (???\n\nR?\n|???(?)|2|?|2???)?1??1\n\n= ?(?, ?)?(??)?\n?\n2 ??2?1\n\n?2 [?]\n2(1??1)\n? ? . (2.4.13)\n\nOur aim now is to bound [?]? ? by [?]?? and ????1 .

(2.4.14)\n\nWe finally use the classical interpolation results between ??(R?) and ? ?(R?) spaces due to\nL. Nirenberg in [62], see also [17] for a full statement. This interpolation inequality ensures\nthe existence of a constant depending on ? and ? such that\n\n???2?2 6 ? ???\n(?+2?)/(?+?)\n?1 [?]\n\n?/(?+?)\n?? .\n\nPutting it together with (2.4.14), it yields\n\n[?]2? ? 6 ?(?, ?, ?) ???\n2?/?\n?1 [?]\n\n2?/?\n??\n\n(?\n???(?+2?)/(?+?)\n\n?1 [?]\n?/(?+?)\n??\n\n)?1?2?/?\n6 ?(?, ?, ?) ???(?+2??2?)/(?+?)\n\n?1 [?]\n(?+2?)/(?+?)\n?? .\n\n60\n\n\n\nFinally, we plug this into (2.4.13) and we obtain\n\n???2?2 6 ?(?, ?)?(??)\n? ?2 ??2?1\n\n?2 [?]\n2(1??1)\n? ?\n\n6 ??(??)?\n?\n2 ??2?1\n\n?2\n\n(?\n???(?+2??2?)/(?+?)\n\n?1 [?]\n(?+2?)/(?+?)\n??\n\n)?1??1\n= ??(??)?\n\n?\n2 ??2?1\n\n?2 ???\n?(?+2??2?)/(?+?)(?+?)\n?1 [?]\n\n?(?+2?)/(?+?)(?+?)\n?? ,\n\nwhich concludes the proof.\n\nTherefore, from Theorem 2.4.1 and Theorem 2.4.4, we derive the following decay towards\nthe stationary state under the ?2 norm.\n\nCorollary 2.4.6. Assume that ?0 satisfies 0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| for all ? ? R and some\n?, ? > 0. Then, for each 0 &lt;? &lt;1/2, the solution of (2.1.1) with initial data ?0 satisfies\n\n??(?) ? ????2 6 ?

(0, 1) such that the solution ? of (2.1.1) satisfies ?(?) ? ? ? (R) ? ??(R) for all\n? > 0 with a uniform bound in time. Since ?? is bounded and (1 ? ?)-H\u00f6lder continuous,\nwe have that ?(?) := ?(?) ? ?? ? ? ?(R) for all ? > 0 with ? ? min{?, 1 ? ?}. So we can\nuse inequality (2.4.11) for ? and 0 &lt;2? &lt;?, the Lemma 2.4.3 and the Theorem 2.4.1 to\nconclude\n\n??(?) ? ????2 6 ??(??)\n? ?2 (?(?) ? ??)??1?2 ??(?) ? ???\n\n?3\n?1 [?(?) ? ??]\n\n?2\n??\n\n6 ?

Otherwise,\none has to work a bit due to the sign of the constant in the fractional operator. In any case,\na uniform in time control of the second moments together with the ?2-decay rates implies\n?1-decay rates. For the next result, a similar calculation was performed in [27, Lemma 2.24].\n\n61\n\n\n\nCorollary 2.4.7. Assume that ?0 satisfies 0 6 ?0(?) 6 ????|?| for all ? ? R and some\n?, ? > 0.
