A reten\u00e7\u00e3o de P referida \u00e9 a principal limita\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 absor\u00e7\u00e3o de P pelas plantas e ao \n\nrendimento das culturas, devido ao baixo teor biodispon\u00edvel de P na solu\u00e7\u00e3o do solo. Assim, torna-se \n\nnecess\u00e1rio o recurso \u00e0 aduba\u00e7\u00e3o fosfatada, por forma a suprir as necessidades das culturas. Na ilha do Pico, \n\narquip\u00e9lago dos A\u00e7ores, cerca de 40 % dos solos agr\u00edcolas s\u00e3o prados de pastagem, sendo praticada, \n\nportanto, a aduba\u00e7\u00e3o P sem incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o no solo, incluindo os solos de encostas mais declivosas. \n\nO trabalho agora apresentado, articulado em dois estudos e dedicado a solos derivados de materiais \n\nvulc\u00e2nicos e recolhidos na ilha do Pico, teve os seguintes objetivos: (i) a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do risco potencial de \n\nperdas de P para \u00e1guas, (ii) o relacionamento das propriedades de Andossolos, nomeadamente os teores de \n\nAl e Fe extra\u00edveis por oxalato de am\u00f3nio (Alox e Feox) e das fra\u00e7\u00f5es de P, com a atividade das exoenzimas \n\nfosfatase \u00e1cida (AP) e ?-glucosidase (?G), bem como (iii) a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do esfor\u00e7o microbiano na aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde P. \n\nA aduba\u00e7\u00e3o mineral e a deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de urinas e fezes dos animais em pastoreio s\u00e3o os respons\u00e1veis \n\npela acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de P nas camadas superficiais dos solos, tendo-se observado, neste estudo, um teor m\u00e9dio \n\nde 3,7 g Pt kg\n-1, valor que pode ser considerado muito elevado e que sugere situa\u00e7\u00f5es de sobrefertiliza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nSimultaneamente, a eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1guas de superf\u00edcie, devido a polui\u00e7\u00e3o difusa, \u00e9 um problema real no \n\narquip\u00e9lago dos A\u00e7ores, sendo os solos agr\u00edcolas a sua causa mais \u00f3bvia. Por outro lado, os compostos de \n\nAl e Fe, respons\u00e1veis pela intensa reten\u00e7\u00e3o de P, parecem estar tamb\u00e9m envolvidos na elevada acumula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica nas camadas superficiais destes solos, reprimindo a atividade enzim\u00e1tica e microbiana, \n\ne/ou protegendo a mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica da mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nOs Andossolos H\u00e1plicos e Pl\u00e1cicos apresentaram teores de carbono org\u00e2nico (OC), Alox e Feox mais \n\nelevados que os Andossolos V\u00edtricos. Em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o ao OC e \u00e0s diferentes fra\u00e7\u00f5es de P, os teores de Alox e \n\nFeox aumentam com a profundidade dos solos. O P org\u00e2nico (Po) e inorg\u00e2nico (Pi) representam 54 e 46 % \n\ndo P total (Pt), observando-se um maior contributo de Po nos Andossolos H\u00e1plicos e Pl\u00e1cicos e de Pi nos \n\nAndossolos V\u00edtricos. \n\nOs teores de Pi-Olsen, P-AL e P-CaCl2 encontram-se acima dos valores cr\u00edticos agron\u00f3micos \n\nreferidos na literatura. Contudo, o \u00edndice de satura\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00f3sforo (ISP) nos solos estudados s\u00e3o inferiores a \n\n25 %, valor acima do qual os solos se encontram em risco de desadsor\u00e7\u00e3o de P. Em m\u00e9dia, o grupo de tr\u00eas \n\nAndossolos V\u00edtricos apresentaram valores de ISP mais elevados (14,1 %) que os restantes tr\u00eas Andossolos \n\nH\u00e1plicos e Pl\u00e1cicos (6,6 %). Em condi\u00e7\u00f5es laboratoriais que pretendem antever os riscos de P relativos \u00e0 \n\ndrenagem interna de solos (1: 100), escorrimento superficial (1: 1000) e sedimentos sob massas de \u00e1gua \n\n\n\n \n\nxiv \n \n\nest\u00e1ticas (1: 10000), usando o 0,01 M CaCl2 como eletr\u00f3lito, observa-se que os teores de P desadsorvido se \n\nencontravam abaixo dos limites cr\u00edticos ambientais, respetivamente de 0,1, 0,05 e 0,02-0,03 mg P L-1. \n\nDeste modo, a eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o das massas de \u00e1gua, n\u00e3o dever\u00e1 ter como fonte difusa o P desadsorvido \n\ndos Andossolos estudados. Uma vez que os adubos fosfatados s\u00e3o aplicados \u00e0 superf\u00edcie dos solos, sem \n\nincorpora\u00e7\u00e3o, deve ser considerada a hip\u00f3tese do direto escorrimento superficial dos mesmos durante \n\nepis\u00f3dios de precipita\u00e7\u00e3o, antes mesmo de ocorrer a completa solubiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do P aplicado e sua e intera\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncom a matriz do solo. Assim, a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o localizada de fertilizantes, em profundidade com menor frequ\u00eancia, \n\ndever\u00e1 ser considerada como uma alternativa \u00e0 interdita\u00e7\u00e3o do uso de adubos, mesmo nas \u00e1reas mais \n\nsens\u00edveis e montanhosas das bacias hidrogr\u00e1ficas das ilhas do Arquip\u00e9lago dos A\u00e7ores. \n\nConsiderando a influ\u00eancia do material origin\u00e1rio dos solos e o efeito da sua gest\u00e3o no teor e \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o vertical da MO e da atividade enzim\u00e1tica, verificou-se a acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de OC e de diferentes \n\nformas de Po nas camadas mais superficiais. Em simult\u00e2neo, ambos os par\u00e2metros apresentam-se altamente \n\ncorrelacionados com os teores de Alox e Feox, em particular com Feox, e com o gradiente em profundidade \n\nda AP e ?G. Ao contr\u00e1rio do referido na literatura, o elevado teor de Pi nos solos, resultado da fertiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmineral fosfatada, n\u00e3o parece promover, s\u00f3 por si, a inibi\u00e7\u00e3o da atividade da AP. Considerando as 30 \n\namostras de solo estudadas, observaram-se correla\u00e7\u00f5es significativas e diretamente proporcionais entre a \n\nAP e as diferentes formas de Pi, nomeadamente Pi total, Pi-Olsen e P-CaCl2. \n\nObservaram-se elevadas raz\u00f5es AP: ?G, quando se avaliou a rela\u00e7\u00e3o estequiom\u00e9trica entre ambas \n\nas exoenzimas. Estes resultados indicam que a biodisponibilidade real de P \u00e9 mais reduzida do que a \n\ndisponibilidade sugerida pelos m\u00e9todos de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o laboratorial que utilizam solu\u00e7\u00f5es qu\u00edmicas extrativas. \n\nSe na matriz do solo, o teor de Pi existir em quantidade suficiente para suprimir as necessidades microbianas \n\npara a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da homeostasia e crescimento, a aloca\u00e7\u00e3o energ\u00e9tica para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de AP dever\u00e1 \n\ndiminuir. Contudo, devido \u00e0 elevada reten\u00e7\u00e3o de Pi nos constituintes de Al e Fe, dever\u00e1 ocorrer uma aloca\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nenerg\u00e9tica suplementar para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o da AP, no sentido da mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o de Po, por forma a assegurarem \n\na aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de P para a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da homeostasia. No caso dos solos com elevados teores de Alox e Feox, \n\nos Andossolos H\u00e1plicos e Pl\u00e1cicos, a raz\u00e3o AP: ?G variou entre 10,7 e 14,7, em oposi\u00e7\u00e3o, os Andossolos \n\nV\u00edtricos, com menores teores de Alox e Feox, que apresentaram uma raz\u00e3o AP: ?G m\u00e9dia de 5,6. \n\nRelativamente ao potencial de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o C:P (ln(?G)/ln(AP)), os Andossolos H\u00e1plicos e Pl\u00e1cicos \n\napresentaram um valor m\u00e9dio de 0.78 e os Andossolos V\u00edtricos 0.85. Sendo o valor de refer\u00eancia global \n\n0.95, os potenciais de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o C:P determinados sugerem, mais uma vez, a reduzida biodisponibilidade \n\nde P nos solos estudados. Em ambos os casos, observa-se que o esfor\u00e7o para a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de P e o potencial \n\nde aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o C:P s\u00e3o afetados pela dimens\u00e3o das diferentes fra\u00e7\u00f5es de Pi e teores de Al e Fe presentes no \n\nsolo. \n\nPor outro lado, o valor da raz\u00e3o molar C:P m\u00e9dia dos solos estudados \u00e9 de 115. Sendo 166 o valor \n\nde refer\u00eancia para solos de pastagem, valor acima do qual a literatura indica que se dever\u00e3o verificar \n\nsitua\u00e7\u00f5es de car\u00eancia de P, os resultados obtidos parecem indicar que este valor cr\u00edtico dever\u00e1 ser ajustado \n\nno caso dos Andossolos. \n\n\n\n \n\nxv \n \n\nPor \u00faltimo, os resultados obtidos n\u00e3o nos permitem avaliar, de um modo inequ\u00edvoco, a raz\u00e3o sobre \n\nos elevados teores de OC nos solos derivados de materiais vulc\u00e2nicos. Contudo, fica evidente o papel central \n\ne determinante dos minerais ativos de Al e Fe nessa acumula\u00e7\u00e3o, em virtude: (i) da capacidade dos minerais \n\nativos de Al e Fe em se ligarem e protegerem as mol\u00e9culas org\u00e2nicas da mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o; (ii) da reduzida \n\natividade da ?G, atividade que parece ser reprimida pelos compostos de Al e Fe, afetando a taxa de \n\nmineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o de OC; e (iii) da aloca\u00e7\u00e3o energ\u00e9tica para a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de P devido \u00e0 reten\u00e7\u00e3o de Pi nestes \n\nsolos, alterando as rea\u00e7\u00f5es metab\u00f3licas celulares e limitando o crescimento do compartimento da biomassa \n\nmicrobiana do solo, respons\u00e1vel pela mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica. \n\n \n\nPalavras chave: Eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o; \u00cdndice de satura\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00f3sforo; Andossolos, Mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica; F\u00f3sforo \norg\u00e2nico; Fosfatase \u00e1cida; ?-Glucosidase; Esfor\u00e7o de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de P. \n\n\n\n \n\nxvii \n\n \n\nEXTENDED ABSTRACT \n\nThe disproportionate amount of organic matter, nearly 5,0 % of global carbon, and the high \n\nPhosphorus (P) content sorbed by aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe) soil components are characteristic \n\nof soils derived from volcanic materials. Simultaneously, the reported P retention it is a main \n\nlimitation for crop P uptake and production yield, due to its limited bioavailability. To overcome \n\nthis major constraint, P fertilization is needed to supply production yield needs. In Pico island \n\nnearly 40 % of the agricultural land is used for grassland pastures and superficial P fertilization \n\nwithout incorporation is the main practice, even in situations with high slopes.  \n\nWorking with soils derived from volcanic materials collected in Pico Island, Azores \n\narchipelago, this combined study aimed to assess the potential risk of P loss into receiving waters, \n\nand relate soil andic properties and P characteristics to the extra cellular enzyme acid phosphatase \n\n(AP) and ?-glucosidase (?G) activities.  \n\nFertilization is responsible for P accumulation at the soil surface, with values that can be \n\nclassified as too high, such as the average value of 3.7 g Pt kg\n-1 observed in the present study, which \n\nsuggest situations of P over-fertilization. Simultaneously, eutrophication of waterbodies is an \n\nactual problem in the Azorean archipelago and soils are the obvious source of this non-point \n\npollution. On the other hand, the Al and Fe soil compounds seem to be involved in the high organic \n\nmatter content retained in the superficial layers of these soils, repressing microbial and enzyme \n\nactivity and/or protecting organic matter from mineralization.  \n\nHaplic and Placic Andosols presented higher organic carbon (OC), Alox and Feox \n\n(ammonium oxalate extractable) contents than the Vitric Andosols, and Alox and Feox values show \n\nan increase along the soils depth, opposite to the different P pools. The organic (Po) and inorganic \n\n(Pi) P contents represented nearly 54 and 46 % of total P (Pt), respectively. Haplic and Placic \n\nAndosols had higher Po contribution, and Vitric Andosols a higher contribution of Pi.  \n\nDespite Pi-Olsen, P-AL and P-CaCl2 contents were above the agronomical threshold values, \n\nnone of the studied soils had DPS values above the conservative critical value of 25 %. On average, \n\nVitric Andosols presented higher values (14.1 %) than Haplic and Placic Andosols (6.6 %). When \n\nassessing the desorbed P with 0.01M CaCl2 as the electrolyte solution for mimicking conditions for \n\nP in drainage (1: 100), runoff (1: 1000) and static waterbodies (1: 10000), the desorbed P contents \n\nin all the soils were below the environmental critical limits, respectively 0.1, 0.05 and 0.02-3 mg P \n\nL-1.  \n\nThe results indicate that soil Pi is still below the environmental thresholds, although above \n\nthe agronomical threshold. Therefore, P desorption from the studied Andosols do not seem to be \n\n\n\n \n\nxviii \n\n \n\nthe main source for waterbodies eutrophication. Since inorganic fertilizers are superficially applied, \n\nit must be considered the hypothesis of their direct runoff during rainfall events, before complete \n\ndissolution and P interaction with soil matrix. Therefore, the fertilizer application with deep-\n\nbanding systems in longer periods of time needs to be considered as an alternative to the \n\ninterdiction of the use of fertilizers on the most sensitive and hilly areas of the watersheds. \n\nRegarding the effect of the management on the size and vertical distribution of organic \n\nmolecules and enzyme activity, it was observed a superficial accumulation of organic carbon (OC) \n\nand Po pool, which was highly correlated with Alox and Feox contents, particularly with Feox, and \n\nwith the stratified gradient of the evaluated enzymes activities. Soil P richness, as the result of \n\ninorganic P fertilization, did not show an inhibition effect on AP activity. In fact, when considering \n\nall the 30 soil samples under study, AP activity showed a linear and significant relationships with \n\nthe different Pi pools, namely with total Pi, Pi-Olsen and P-CaCl2. \n\nWhen assessing the stoichiometric relationship between both enzymes, high values for the \n\nAP: ?G ratio were obtained. These values suggest that microbial communities allocate high energy \n\neffort to ensure P acquisition for homeostasis maintenance. In Haplic and Placic Andosols, with \n\nhigher Alox and Feox contents, the AP: ?G ranged from 10.7 to 14.7, contrasting with the average \n\nvalue of 5.6 presented by the Vitric Andosols. Concerning the potential C:P acquisition (ln(?G): \n\nln(AP)), Haplic and Placic Andosols showed an average of 0.78 and Vitric Andosols an average of \n\n0.85, values which are below the global threshold limit of 0.95, above which soils are supposed to \n\nhave an adequate P availability. \n\nThe effort for P acquisition and the potential of C:P acquisition indices are both affected by \n\nthe size of the Pi pools and by Alox + Feox contents. If available Pi was present at levels able to \n\nsupply growth requirements and ensure homeostasis condition, the energy allocation to produce \n\nAP enzymes would decrease. Since Pi retention is high in Andosols, due to high Al and Fe minerals \n\ncontent, energy allocation shifts to the production of AP enzymes to mineralize soil Po. Moreover, \n\nthe average C:P molar ratio of the six soils (115) is below the threshold value proposed for pasture \n\nsoils (166), above which soils may present low P availability, which means that threshold value \n\nneeds to be adjusted for Andosols. \n\nDespite the central and determinant role of the active Al and Fe, the present results do not \n\nallow a clear justification for the high OC contents on the soils derived from volcanic materials, \n\nsince Al and Fe compounds are simultaneously related with different soil parameters. Therefore, \n\nsome hypothesis may be considered for that accumulation: (i) the ability of Al and Fe compounds \n\nto bound and protect organic molecules from mineralization; (ii) the low ?G activity, which seems \n\nto be repressed by Al and Fe compounds, affecting the rate of the OC mineralization; (iii) the high \n\ndemand of energy for P acquisition due to the intense Pi retention on the Al and Fe compounds, \n\n\n\n \n\nxix \n\n \n\nwhich shifts the allocation of cell resources in detriment of microbe growth, limiting the size of the \n\nsoil microbial biomass compartment. \n\n \n\nKey words: Eutrophication; Degree of Phosphorus Saturation; Andosols, Soil Organic Matter; Organic \n\nPhosphorus; Acid phosphatase; ?-Glucosidase; P acquisition effort. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nxxi \n\n \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS xi \n\nRESUMO ALARGADO xiii \n\nEXTENDED ABSTRACT xvii \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS xxi \n\nLIST OF FIGURES xxv \n\nLIST OF TABLES xxvii \n\nABBREVIATIONS xxix \n\nChapter 1 - Introduction 1 \n\n1 - Introduction 2 \n\n1.1 - Phosphorus (P) 2 \n\n1.2 - Soil P Cycle 3 \n\n1.2.1 - Soil P forms 5 \n\n1.2.1.1 - Inorganic P and chemical/physical processes 5 \n\nPrimary P minerals 5 \n\nSecondary P minerals 6 \n\nSorbed P 6 \n\nPi in soil solution 7 \n\n1.2.1.2 - Organic P and biological processes 7 \n\nOrganic P forms 8 \n\nPhosphorus immobilization/mineralization 9 \n\n1.3 - Enzymes 10 \n\n1.3.1 - ?-Glucosidase 11 \n\n1.3.2 - Phosphatases 11 \n\n1.4 - Resource allocation for P acquisition 12 \n\n\n\n \n\nxxii \n\n \n\n1.5 - Phosphorus Inputs/Outputs 14 \n\n1.6 - Phosphorus environmental impacts 16 \n\n1.7 - Volcanic ash soils 17 \n\n1.8 - The Azores archipelago, the Pico island case 18 \n\nObjectives 19 \n\n1.9 - References 20 \n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic \n\nmaterials and altered by fertilized pastures. 27 \n\n2.1 - Abstract 28 \n\n2.2 - Introduction 29 \n\n2.3 - Materials and methods 33 \n\n2.3.1 - Soil classification and land management 33 \n\n2.3.2 - Soil Sampling 33 \n\n2.3.3 - Soil Analysis 34 \n\n2.3.4 - P desorption 35 \n\n2.3.5 - Statistical analysis 35 \n\n2.4 Results and Discussion 36 \n\n2.4.1 - Soil P status 36 \n\n2.4.2 - Extractable Alox and Feox 42 \n\n2.4.3 - Risk assessment indices 43 \n\n2.4.4 - Desorption risk assessment 46 \n\n2.5 - Conclusions 49 \n\n2.6 - References 50 \n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived \n\nfrom volcanic material: distribution profile and P acquisition effort 54 \n\n\n\n \n\nxxiii \n\n \n\n3.1 - Abstract 55 \n\n3.2 - Introduction 56 \n\n3.3 - Materials and methods 60 \n\n3.3.1 - Soil classification and land management 60 \n\n3.3.2 - Soil Sampling 60 \n\n3.3.3 - Soil Analysis 60 \n\n3.3.4 - P characterization 60 \n\n3.3.5 - Enzymatic activity 61 \n\n3.3.6 - Statistical analysis 61 \n\n3.4 - Results and Discussion 62 \n\n3.4.1 - Soil properties 62 \n\n3.4.2 - Soil enzyme activities 66 \n\n3.4.3 - P acquisition effort 72 \n\n3.5 - Conclusions 77 \n\n3.6 - References 79 \n\nChapter 4 - General Conclusions 84 \n\n4.1 - General conclusions 85 \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nxxv \n\n \n\nLIST OF FIGURES  \n \n\nChapter 1 - Introduction  \n\nFigure 1.1 - Soil phosphorus cycle synthesis.

van Bavel, 2013), since agricultural areas are becoming \n\nscarce and poor, due to inadequate management practices. Nevertheless, the inappropriate use of \n\nthe agricultural soils and overuse of the production factors, such as chemical fertilizers, animal \n\nmanure and pesticides (Quansah, 2010), have led to environmental problems, namely soil and water \n\nquality depletion, and air contamination (Savci, 2012). \n\nThe nutrient dynamics in the agro-ecosystems is a function of integrative effects of soil \n\nnutrients transformations, availability, soil management, rhizosphere, microorganisms and plant \n\nbiological processes (Sinsabaugh, 1994). Over the history, mankind learned to maximize \n\nagronomical yields through the use of animal manures and other natural residues, without relying \n\nonly on the native properties and quality of the soil. From the beginning of last century, the use of \n\nchemical fertilizers became the prime resource of nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) \n\nand potassium (K) in the form of salts, since they could give a greater and faster response to the \n\nrequirements of the progressively more productive crop systems (Savci, 2012). Nevertheless, this \n\npolicy has induced to the misuse of the synthetic fertilizers, most often without any technical and \n\neconomic justifications, leading to the severe environmental problems detected during the final of \n\nthe century and leading to the present societal concerns (Aggani, 2013). Therefore, it is clear the \n\nimportance of the knowledge and implementation of agriculture management practices without \n\ncausing damage on other ecosystems (\u00d6nder et al., 2011) and how to recover from the abuse of \n\nproduction factors from the past (Giovannucci et al., 2012). \n\n1.1 - Phosphorus (P) \n\nPhosphorus (P) is an essential element for crop production, since it is a component of \n\nseveral fundamental biochemical molecules such as DNA, RNA, ATP, NADPH and phospholipids \n\n(Santos, 2015). Moreover, research attention has been given to P, since it is a nonrenewable \n\nresource (Cordell et al., 2009). In nature, P as its origin through the weathering process of soil \n\nminerals, such as apatite and other geologically stable materials (Lindsay et al., 1989). Phosphorus \n\nis the 11th most abundant element in the earth\u2019s crust and it is at the center of serious environmental \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n3 \n\n \n\nissues as the depletion of the available reserves and the decline of fresh water quality. This non-\n\nrenewable resource is confined to small areas in the planet, and although new reserves have been \n\ndiscovered, is still lacking the evaluation of its quality and feasibility as raw material for the \n\nfertilizer industry (Sharpley et al., 2001). \n\nEfficient P absorption and acquisition by crop is essential to achieve a desired crop yield. \n\nSo, maintaining a proper P content in soils enhances plant P efficient uptake from the rhizosphere \n\nby an integrative morphological and physiological root adaptive strategies (Cabrera, 2005). The \n\namount of P required to be uptaken by plants may not be are immediately available on the soil. \n\nTherefore, the low soil P availability is a limiting factor for crop production in many of the soils, \n\nwhich is aggravated by the P fixation into soils components, which leads to slow diffusion rates in \n\nsoil solution. Mineral P fertilizers and animal manure application improve P availability and crop \n\nyield (Schr\u00f6der et al., 2010), but may lead to environmental consequences in several ecosystems, \n\nsuch has freshwater eutrophication (Daniel et al., 1998). Consequently, maintaining the \n\nconcentration of P in the soil solution in an adequate range for plant uptake, often cited as > 0.2 \n\nmg L-1, while restricting P content in surface waters below 0.03 mg L-1, is a challenge faced by \n\nthose involved in soil and crop nutrition management (Pierzynski et al., 2005). \n\n1.2 - Soil P Cycle  \n\nSeveral inorganic and biological processes are involved in P cycling, as it is shown in Figure \n\n1.1. Orthophosphate (PO4\n3-) is the major form of P in soils, and is present on a content ranging \n\nfrom 100 to 3000 mg P kg-1 (Frossard et al., 1995). Generally, the bioavailable orthophosphate ions \n\nare present either as HPO4\n2- (pH > 7.2) and H2PO4\n\n- (pH 4.0 - 7.2) (Pierzynski et al., 2005). Aiming \n\nto reduce the consumption of chemical P fertilizer and their environmental impacts, several \n\npractices are needed to be thoughtful implemented, such as maximizing exploitation of the \n\nbiological potential of root/rhizosphere processes for efficient mobilization and acquisition of soil \n\nP by plants, as well the P recycling from manures and other residues (Sharpley and Beegle, 2001). \n\nTherefore, a holistic understanding of P dynamics in soil is necessary for a better P management \n\nand maximization on the P-use efficiency. \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n4 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 - Soil phosphorus cycle synthesis. Major chemical and biological processes involved in P bioavailability \n\nin soil ecosystem and pathways of P loss into superficial freshwaters and subterranean waters, adapted from Pierzynski \n\net al. (2005). \n\nInorganic processes of the P cycle involve several physical and chemical phenomenas like \n\nprecipitation/dissolution and sorption/desorption. Biological processes involve primarily uptake by \n\nhigher plant and microorganisms of dissolved P released for soil solution during the weathering \n\nfenomenon of primary or secondary minerals. The inorganical P (Pi) forms are cycled through \n\nseveral processes in a complex food chain via a serie of mineralization and immobilization \n\nreactions (Frossard et al., 1995). The proportion of organic P (Po) varys between 30 to 65% of the \n\nsoil total P (Pt), but in grassland pastures the proportion is normaly higher than 50% (Nash et al., \n\n2014) and in soils rich organic matter (SOM), the Po contribution may reach up to 90% (Harrison, \n\n1987). Plant P uptake is the primary pathway through which P is removed from soil, although \n\nsurface leaching, runoff and erosion are also pathways for P losses into other environmental \n\ncompartments, while gaseous losses do not occurs (Pierzynski et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n5 \n\n \n\n1.2.1 - Soil P forms \n\nAs referred, soil P is usually distinguished between inorganic and organic forms (Santos, \n\n2015). Soil Pi forms are governed by precipitation, dissolution and sorption/desorption processes \n\nand chemical equilibriums. Generally, Pi has low solubility, is easily fixed and, consequently, it is \n\nrelatively immobile in soil. Its molecular chemistry is determined by the ionic bonds to the \n\nsurrounding atoms and it is the relative strength of these ionic bonds that explains how P behaves \n\nin soil (Doolette and Smernik, 2011). Soil Po may be also affected by precipitation, dissolution and \n\nsorption. Po forms have one or more covalent bonds to a C atom, generally via an ester linkage \n\n(through an oxygen atom). Therefore, the majority of Po transformations, in particular their \n\nconversion to Pi, requires the covalent bond breaking (Berg and Joern, 2006).  \n\nThe differentiation between Pi and Po forms is easy to make using long-established chemical \n\ntechniques. Nevertheless, this differentiation is only a simplification of soil P speciation, because \n\neach of these groups comprise a huge range of chemical P forms. Pi is traditionally detected \n\nspectrophotometrically by molecular absorption as a blue-colored phosphomolybdenum complex, \n\nformed when free phosphate anions react with an acidified molybdate reagent (Murphy and Riley \n\nmethod). Because Po does not form a colored complex with that reagent, it can be only determined \n\nas the difference between the total P (measured as Pi after a soil extract digestion) and the readily \n\nPi (Doolette and Smernik, 2011). \n\n1.2.1.1 - Inorganic P and chemical/physical processes \n\nPi exists as primary and secondary solid P phases or adsorbed onto soil minerals, being well \n\nestablished its propensity to be precipitated or to be bounded on existing solid phases, according \n\nto the several chemical equilibriums that are established in soil solution (Lindsay, 1979). The \n\nmajority of soil P minerals, which are divided in two groups, exist in the form of amorphous co-\n\nprecipitates, with different degrees of substitution. \n\nPrimary P minerals \n\nThe group of stoichiometric apatites, Ca10(X)(PO4)6, where X represents F\n-, Cl-, OH-, or \n\nCO3\n2-, is the most common and abundant primary P mineral on earth crust, and its weathering is \n\nthe first step of P cycling (Frossard et al., 1995). There are also some forms of apatites in soils \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n6 \n\n \n\nknown as non-stoichiometric, where part of the Ca is substituted Na+, K+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Ba2+, Fe3+ or \n\nPO4\n3- is substituted by HPO4\n\n2-, CO3\n2-, AsO3\n\n2- or VO4\n3-, which present higher solubility products \n\nthan stoichiometric apatites (Bengtsson et al., 2009). In calcareous environments apatites are very \n\nstable, requiring a H+ source to supply Ca and P for soil solution. For that reason, in soils with pH \n\nabove 6.2, rock phosphate have no agronomical usefulness due to its reduced P availability for crop \n\nuptake (Daniel et al., 1998 and Fardeau et al., 1988). \n\nSecondary P minerals \n\nThese minerals are the reactions products between soluble P and Al, Fe or Ca. In calcareous \n\nsoils, after an initial absorption of P onto the surface of calcite, calcium phosphates can be formed \n\nby precipitation, in a chain of composts, depending on the abundance of Ca. Monocalcium \n\nphosphate precipitates, and then transforms to dicalcium phosphate, to octocalcium \n\n(Ca8H2(PO4)6.5H2O) and finally to hydroxyapatite, and the mineral having the lowest solubility \n\nshould ultimately control the concentration of P in the soil solution, while the intermediate \n\nprecipitates are unlikely to persist in soils (Frossard et al., 1995). With the exception of the mono \n\nand dicalcium phosphates, all the others have low solubility and reduced P availability for plant \n\nuptake (Pierzynsk et al., 2005; Santos 2015). \n\nIn acid and well drained soils, the presence of Al and Fe cations, leads to the P precipitation \n\nin the form of Al or Fe-phosphates. In these conditions, variscite (AlPO4.2H2O) and stregite \n\n(FePO4.2H2O) are the main phosphate forms, but vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2.8H2O) is dominant in \n\nhydromorphic soils (Morel, 1996). Nevertheless, the abundant presence of amorphous oxides-Al \n\nor Fe can lead to occlusion, becoming difficult to identify the P-Al and P-Fe minerals (Pierzynsk \n\net al., 2005). \n\nSorbed P \n\nThe behavior phosphate anions in soil is mediated by soil colloids that play a major role in \n\nits availability to crop uptake (Guppy et al., 2005). Adsorption occurs when P accumulates and \n\nbonds onto the surface of soil solid constituents, and desorption is the diffusion of sorbed P into \n\nthe soil solution (Sposito, 1986). Regarding sorption, the process is considered as a continuous \n\nsequence of adsorption and precipitation and consists of two processes: (i) a reversible adsorption, \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n7 \n\n \n\nwhich is relatively fast and (ii) a relatively slow, practically irreversible precipitation-like process \n\nbeing very difficult to distinguish between the two of them (van der Zee and van Riemsdijk, 1988). \n\nBy replacing H2O or OH\n-, P is sorbed onto Al and Fe hydrous oxides, clay minerals and carbonates \n\nsurfaces and edges (Corey, 1981) and sorption and desorption reactions tend to equilibrate with \n\nsoil P solution. On a P-rich environment, when the solubility product constants are exceeded due \n\nto over fertilizations, sorption can evolve into precipitation as secondary P solid phases previously \n\nreferred (Pierzynsk et al., 2005). \n\nPi in soil solution \n\nThe proportion and form of Pi is governed by soil pH (Figure 1.2). In acidic conditions, the \n\nH2PO4\n- anion is the form dominant and when the pH arises, HPO4\n\n2- anion form is dominant (Santos, \n\n2015). Due to the prevailing pH values of agricultural soils, P in the forms of PO4\n3- anion or H3PO4 \n\nmolecule are not expected to exist in soil solution. \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 - Soil solution pH effect on the phosphate ions proportions (adapted from Hinsinger, 2001). \n\n1.2.1.2 - Organic P and biological processes \n\nDefined as a P bonded to a C, it may represent nearly 90 % of total P in soils very rich in \n\nSOM (Harrison, 1987). Organic P transformations in soil are important for P availability, \n\ndetermining the productivity of ecosystems (Condron et al., 2005). P is absorbed from soil solution \n\nby plant and microorganism, and bonds to C through phosphorylation by different biochemical \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n8 \n\n \n\npathways. Therefore, Po has its primary origin in animal and plant residues, but it is also \n\nsynthesized by microbes and released to the soil after its death. In nature, Po remains at its highest \n\noxidation state, forming always covalent bonds (Goldwhite, 1981). \n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated that Po forms contribute significantly to plant P uptake. \n\nOehl et al. (2001), in Swiss arable soils, reported that Po mineralization rate was equivalent to soil \n\nsolution P, indicating that soil P mineralization is a significant process in delivering available Pi. \n\nThe amount, forms and dynamic of organic P are determined by the combination of biological, \n\nchemical and physical factors, and influenced by environmental parameters and soils management, \n\nas represented in Figure 1.3 (Condron et al., 2005). \n\nOrganic P forms \n\nAlthough representing only a small part of the total Po, organic phosphorus compounds in soils \n\ncan be divide in tree groups (Morel, 1996): \n\n? Inositol phosphates, widely resistant to mineralization, and may represent up to 50% of \n\ntotal organic P; \n\n? Phospholipids and glycerophospholipids, representing between 0.5 to 7% of total organic \n\nP; \n\n? Nucleic acids, and derived compounds, representing up to 3% of soil organic P. \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n9 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 - Soil organic P dynamic (adapted from Condron et al., 2005). \n\nThe methods used to study these fraction are divided in two groups: one group measures \n\nthe total concentrations of Po; other group includes methods to identify the chemical forms Po, their \n\nconcentrations and behavior in soil, such as bonding and mineralization fluxes (Condron et al., \n\n2005). In the latter methods, important advances have been made with the use of layer \n\nchromatography, anion exchange high performance chromatography, gas chromatography, mass \n\nspectroscopy and 31P NMR spectroscopy (Turner and Mckelvie, 2002). \n\nPhosphorus immobilization/mineralization  \n\nThe immobilization/mineralization rate determine the P turnover in soils (Condron et al., 2005). \n\nThe conversion of Pi to Po is a biological process designated as immobilization, occurring via two \n\nimportant pathways (Condron and Goh, 1989): \n\n? To supply microbial biomass requirements, Pi is removed from soil solution (Figure 1.3), \n\nreturning into the soil as Po after cell death and lysis. A net immobilization of Pi by microbes \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n10 \n\n \n\nis expected to prevail over mineralization when soil C/P ratio is above 300 (Stevenson and \n\nCole, 1999). \n\n? To supply crop requirements, Pi is removed from soil solution by plant uptake (Figure 1.3), \n\nreturning to the soil as Po in litter and root debris, or as animal manure and feaces. When \n\ngrassland pastures are subjected to fertilization, a net immobilization occurs, although an \n\nequilibrium is established between Po inputs and mineralization, leading to a decline of \n\norganic P accumulation (Condron et al., 2005). \n\nRegarding P mineralization, it can be defined as the inverse process of immobilization, since is \n\nthe conversion of Po into Pi. Phosphorus is released from soil organic matter or during the \n\ndecomposition process of microbial and plant residues (Condron et al., 2005). The Po \n\nmineralization is mediate by a large group of phosphatases, which are periplasmic or extracellular \n\nenzymes, also designated as exoenzymes or ecoenzymes (Frossard et al., 2000). \n\n1.3 - Enzymes \n\nSoil organic matter complex is both synthesized and degraded by soil microbial activity \n\n(Burns et al., 2013). The balance between these two processes determinates several soil properties, \n\nsuch as: (i) carbon sequestration; (ii) soil aggregation structure and stability; (ii) plant nutrient \n\navailability and; (iii) water retention. Microbial diversity and activity host the enzyme production \n\nthat also determine soil fertility and crop productivity (Burns et al., 2013).  \n\nThe enzymes produced and exuded by plant roots, mycorrhizae, and microorganisms occurs \n\naccording to the nutrient demand and nutrient availability in soils (Sinsabaugh, 1994). Being \n\nconsidered the proximate agents of soil organic matter decomposition, enzymes disrupts plant and \n\nmicrobial cell walls and reduce macromolecules to soluble substrates for posterior uptake and \n\nassimilation (Dick et al., 1988). \n\nIn nature, natural selection leads to enzyme production strategies that minimize costs to the \n\ncell and maximize the associated benefits. The costs to the cells are the carbon and nutrients \n\nrequired for energy (i.e. ATP), enzyme synthesis and secretion, formation and organization of \n\nmembrane transporters for the uptake of the products, and signal production and detection of \n\npotential substrates. Therefore, exoenzyme activities are the result of cellular economics: \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n11 \n\n \n\nexpending resources to produce enzymes versus the benefit of increases on low molecular mass \n\norganics molecules, with consequences in terms of availability of assimilable mineral nutrients and \n\nenergy sources (Burns et al., 2013).  \n\n1.3.1 - ?-Glucosidase \n\nGlucosidases, or glucoside hydrolases, is the general designation used to describe a group \n\nof enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of different glucosides. Widely distributed in nature, they \n\nare detected in microorganisms, animals and plants (Eivazi and Tabatabai, 1988), being also \n\nreported their free existence in soils (Skujins, 1976).  \n\nConsiderable concern has been given to the synthesis, role, and properties of these enzymes \n\nin microorganisms and plants. Nevertheless, only more recently the attention has been also devoted \n\nto studies regarding their role in soils. Glucosidase reaction products are important energy sources \n\nfor soil microorganism, playing a major role in the degradation of carbohydrates (Eivazi and \n\nTabatabai, 1988). Its synthesis is induced by the products of cellulose breakdown, including \n\ncellobiose, glucose and their metabolites (Stewart and Leatherwood, 1976), and its activity has \n\nbeen referred as the rate-limiting step in cellulose degradation (Alef and Nannipieri, 1995). \n\nObjectively, glucosidases catalyze the cleavage of one molecule of cellobiose in two molecules of \n\nglucose, regulating the energy supply for microorganisms, which are unable to take up cellobiose \n\ndirectly. \n\n?-glucosidase (?G) is the most abundant and easily detectable of the three enzymes (endo-\n\n1,4-glucanase, exo-1,4-glucanase and ?-D-glucosidase) involved in cellulose degradation in soil. \n\nRarely substrate limited, it is considered ideal to examine the importance of physico-chemical \n\ncontrols on the turnover of soil organic matter (Turner et al., 2002). Therefore, ?G activity has been \n\nused to closely monitor rapid changes in soil organic C associated with soil management effects \n\n(Bandick and Dick, 1999).  \n\n1.3.2 - Phosphatases \n\nMineralization of Po may be enzymatic (Figure1.3), and this has stimulated much of the \n\nattention in phosphatases activity in soils, microorganisms, and plant roots. Phosphatases are a \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n12 \n\n \n\nbroad group of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of both esters and anhydrides of phosphoric \n\nacid (Schmidt and Laskowski, 1961). \n\nLike other exoenzyme molecule, phosphatases diffuse poorly into the soil matrix (Lefebvre et \n\nal., 1990) and their activity are dependent of different parameters such as soil characteristics, clay \n\nand humus adsorption, microorganisms, plant cover, inputs and the presence of inhibitors or \n\nactivators (Speir and Ross, 1978). There are three types of phosphatases in soils, all of them acting \n\non ester bonds (Deng and Tabatabai, 1997): \n\n? Phosphomonoesterases, a group that includes acid phosphatases and alkaline phosphatases; \n\nboth of them are phosphoric monoester hydrolases with optimal activities in acid and \n\nalkaline environments. These enzymes catalyze the break of the ester bond of the \n\northophosphate group to a C. Phytic acid, mononucleotides such as adenosine-5\u2019-\n\nphosphate, or sugars such as glucose-6-phosphate, are some of the molecules which Po is \n\nhydrolyzed by these groups of enzymes. \n\n? Phosphodiesterases are phosphoric diester hydrolases. These enzymes catalyze the break \n\nof a diester bond, orthophosphate group to two C. Ribonucleic and deoxyribonucleic acids \n\nor phospholipids, such as phosphatidyl inositol, are some of the molecules which Po is \n\nhydrolyzed by these enzymes \n\n? Phosphotriesterases are phosphoric triester hydrolases. These enzymes catalyze the break \n\nof a triester bond to an orthophosphate. Phosphotriesters have not been found in nature \n\n(Saxena, 2008) and they are a class of highly toxic synthetic compounds known as \n\norganophosphates, widely used as insecticides and herbicides (Bigley and Raushel, 2013). \n\nThe activity of these enzyme is determinant in the soil P cycling and on the microbial and plant \n\nnutrition (Tabatabai and Dick, 2002), by catalyzing mineralization of Po and contributing to soil P \n\nbioavailability. \n\n1.4 - Resource allocation for P acquisition \n\nOnce released from cells, enzyme activity is mediated by environmental factors (Allison, \n\n2006), although their expression is regulated by environmental signals (Dick et al., 2011), which \n\nin soils are related with the nutrient availability and net resources (Moro et al., 2015). The \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n13 \n\n \n\nextracellular enzyme degradation of organic matter can be seen as a rate-controlling step of Carbon \n\ncycle, which requires a large number of hydrolytic and oxidative reactions, stoichiometric-linked \n\nto the composition and oxidation state of organic matter. Enzyme activities can relate microbial \n\nbiomass and organic matter to the nutrient assimilation and growth stoichiometry (Sinsabaugh and \n\nMoorhead, 1994).  \n\n?-Glucosidase and other cellulolytic enzymes activities are correlated with microbial \n\nmetabolism and the rate of mass loss from plant litter (Sinsabaugh and Moorhead, 1994). Although \n\ntheir magnitude and correlation vary widely in the terrestrial ecosystems when relating to organic \n\nmatter and available Pi, phosphomonoesterases activity presents an inverse relationship with \n\navailable Pi, being one of the most studied extracellular enzyme (Sinsabaugh and Shah, 2012). \n\nDescribing different enzymatic activities, such as ?G and acid phosphatase (AP), in relation to \n\nedaphoclimatic factors, Sinsabaugh et al. (2008) reported that enzymes activities were related to \n\nsoil pH and that hydrolytic activities reflected nutrient availability trends.  \n\n Sinsabaugh et al. (2010) proposed that the exoenzymes activities are consequence of \n\nstoichiometry and metabolism aspects, as result of the equilibrium among microbial biomass, \n\norganic matter, efficiency of nutrient assimilation and growth. Latter, the same authors (Sinsabaugh \n\nand Shah, 2011) presented a conceptual model linking organic matter to exoenzime activities \n\nstoichiometry. Moreover, enzymatic activities can be related among them, since they are \n\nstoichiometric-linked to the nutrient availability and acquisition by microbial biomass. So, enzyme \n\nactivity ratios in soils can be understood as a complemental index of potential nutrient limitation \n\nfor growth (Moro et al., 2015), since energy resources are allocated to supplemental exoenzyme \n\nproduction only if labile forms of substrate (P or N) are in short supply (Allison et al., 2007), \n\nleading to a shift in energy consumption from cell growth towards nutrient acquisition . \n\nMoreover, Sinsabaugh and Moorhead (1994) and Sinsabaugh and Shah (2012) proposed a \n\nresource allocation model for extracellular enzymes in relation to nutrient availability, in which the \n\nratio of a certain nutrient acquiring enzyme activity to C acquiring enzyme activity (?G) would \n\nbecome an indicator of the availability of such nutrient. If related with crops, this proposal may \n\nbecome a complement to the conventional laboratorial approaches to assess nutrients availabilities \n\nin soils. \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n14 \n\n \n\n1.5 - Phosphorus Inputs/Outputs \n\nThe P cycle has been described, in Ecology, as a 'tight cycle', since the P amount present \n\nwithin an ecosystem itself (in the soil and microbial and vegetal biomass) is much larger when \n\ncompared to the gains and losses of the ecosystem (Newman, 1995). In agricultural systems, the P \n\ninput has begun with the use of organic materials (Figure 1.4), as referred previously. However, \n\nafter the middle of 1800, with the advances in plant nutrition by Justus von Liebig, and after the \n\nlate 1800, with the advent of the fertilizer industry, precisely with the calcium superphosphate \n\nmanufacturing, the inputs of Pi in the agricultural systems increased continuously till nowadays. \n\nFertilization affects soil biochemical and biological properties (Liang et al., 2014), and the \n\ninfluence of external nutrient inputs on soil microbial ecology has been frequently emphasized (Ai \n\net al., 2012). As an example, PO4\n3- anions are a competitive inhibitor of both phosphatases in soils \n\n(Juma and Tabatabai, 1978), although the absence of response of phosphatase activities to P \n\naddition has been also reported (Schneider et al., 2001). On the other hand, N fertilization generally \n\nincreases the activity of phosphatases in soils (Marklein and Houlton, 2012). \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 - Scheme synthetizing the soil P Input and Outputs. \n\nDue to its low mobility, solubility and concentration in soil solution, P leads to limit the net \n\nproduction in a continuous agriculture land use (Frossard et al., 1995). Therefore, the application \n\nof fertilizers and by-products containing P to soils has the main purpose to increase the bioavailable \n\nphosphorus in soil solution, to supply plants requirements (Hedley and McLaughlin, 2005), and \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n15 \n\n \n\nremove P crop starvation. To be effective, the fertilizer P need to be more soluble than the existent \n\nsoils phosphorus compounds (Hedley and McLaughlin, 2005). \n\nAnimal manures, crop residues, municipal and industrial wastes and other residues are often \n\ncalled by-products, since they converge diverse mixtures that includes Pi and Po at different stages \n\nof decomposition, potentially acting in a similar manner as mineral P fertilizers (Hedley and \n\nMcLaughlin, 2005). Although by-products efficiency is also affected by soil components, such as \n\nAl, Fe and Ca, their fate is usually a function of the microbial decomposition rate (Hedley and \n\nMcLaughlin, 2005). \n\nThe rate of organic matter accumulation in terrestrial systems is directly related to their net \n\nprimary productivity and subsequent rate of organic matter return to soil (Grace et al., 1998). \n\nRelationships are found between soil organic matter accumulation and P fertilizer use when these \n\ninputs regulate the net primary productivity of the system (Simpson et al., 2011). Accumulation of \n\nPo in the range of 1.7 to 4 kg ha\n-1 yr-1 were recorded for pastures on low P available soils (Kohn et \n\nal., 1977). \n\nThe accumulation of P in soil it is not inevitable, and is extremely influenced by the farming \n\nsystem and management practices (Simpson et al., 2011). Agricultural P applications may be \n\nadjusted in order to maintain soil bioavailability in a steady state or the returning rate of Po to the \n\nsoil may be stabilize provide that primary productivity is stabilized. Nevertheless, in many of the \n\nagricultural systems, bioavailable P exceeds the agronomical threshold value for plant growth as a \n\nresult of over fertilization practices. In other situations, organic matter and Po continues to \n\naccumulate in soils, either because the capacity of the soil to retain organic matter is not yet \n\nachieved, or a balance between the input of plant residues and the rate of mineralization was not \n\nreached (Baldock et al., 2007).  \n\nAnother important part of the P cycle (Figure 1.1) is the transfer of P from soils into \n\nwatersheds. When not enhanced by the misuse of fertilizers, the runoff flux needs to be considered \n\nas a natural process. Similarly, erosion is a natural process in the watersheds, but its intensity is \n\nalso enhanced by inadequate soil management practices. In both situations, the increase of P \n\nenrichment on the receiving waters contributes to the decrease of its quality (Sharpley et al., 2003). \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n16 \n\n \n\n1.6 - Phosphorus environmental impacts \n\nBeing an essential element for plants and animals and required to achieve profitable yield \n\nof crop and livestock production, P increases also the biological productivity of surface waters. As \n\na result, escalation on water eutrophication accelerates the natural aging of lakes and streams \n\n(Sharpley and Beegle, 2001). \n\nWater eutrophication is the biological enrichment of surface waters due to anthropogenic \n\ninputs of nutrients (Kleinman et al., 2009). Since P is the one of the limiting factor for algal growth, \n\nthe increase on agricultural P inputs has been associated with the eutrophication of freshwaters \n\nsystems (Sharpley and Menzel, 1988). The P transfer to surface waters is defined as a nonpoint-\n\nsource pollution of lakes and streams and promotes eutrophication at concentration levels between \n\n0.02 and 0.035 mg P L-1 (Daniel et al., 1998). The transfer intensity from soil to waters depends on \n\nthe P desorption from soil constituents. Therefore, sorption by hydroxides and oxides of Al and Fe \n\nin surface horizons and subsoils or precipitation with Ca can maintain runoff and leached P levels \n\nbelow the eutrophication thresholds values (Elliott et al., 1999). \n\nNevertheless, the growing concerns about water eutrophication and the misuse of P \n\nfertilizers lead to the urgent need for restrictions in P losses from agricultural soils to water and to \n\nthe development of decision support systems to assess and anticipate the risks of those P transfers \n\n(Daniel et al.,  1998). \n\nVan der Zee et al. (1988) proposed a parameter named Degree of P Saturation (DPS), expressed \n\nas the ratio between the total amount of sorbed P and the P Sorption Capacity (PSC) of the soil. \n\nUnder these concepts, the PSC is a measure of the potential P sorption by the major P-sorbing \n\ncomponents in acid soils matrix: the organic Al and Fe complexes and the poorly crystalline Al \n\nand Fe hydroxides and oxides (Freese et al., 1992): \n\n??? =  \n???\n\n???\n \u00d7 100        Eq. 1  \n\n??? =  ? (???? +  ????  )       Eq. 2  \n\nwhere ? = 0.5 and Alox, Feox and Pox are expressed in mmol kg\n-1. \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n17 \n\n \n\nDPS relates the P sorbed to PSC, and the increase of P content in a specific soil leads to the \n\nincrease of DPS. Therefore, P enrichment forwards to the loss of soil ability to remove extra P from \n\nsoil solution due to the buildup equilibrium of P sorbed relative to PSC, driving to situations where \n\nP can be readily loss by superficial runoff and internal leaching (Kleinman et al., 1999). A DPS \n\nvalue of 25% is considered critical, above which P leaching is susceptible to occur (van der Zee et \n\nal., 1988). However, for acid sandy soils in Flanders, a critical limit of 35 % was set, and soils with \n\nvalues below 25% were classified as unsaturated (De Bolle et al., 2013).  \n\nOther methods of assessing the risk of P loss to water are based on standard soil P test \n\n(SPT), as Mehlich-3, Olsen, ammonium lactate methods, iron oxide\u2013coated paper strips and P-\n\nwater extraction (Pote et al., 1999). As an example, Horta and Torrent (2007) evaluated the ability \n\nof Olsen P method to predict the P release from Portuguese acid soils into waters, achieving an \n\nenvironmental threshold value of 50 mg P kg-1. Tentatively, an equivalent threshold value for P-\n\nammonium lactate method may be set to 106 mg P kg-1 for the same type of soils (Horta et al, \n\n2010). Both values may be considered as a change point, above which P losses to receiving waters \n\nbecame unacceptably high. Nevertheless, these values depend not only on the amount of \n\nextractable P, but also on the soil type and desorption situation (Maguire et al., 2005), drawbacks \n\nthat may be overcame by the use of DPS index. \n\n Torrent and Delgado (2001) proposed another P desorption approach, where different \n\nsoil:solution rations mimic various scenarios of soil P desorption to water. According to those \n\nauthors, 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:10000 soil: CaCl2 solution ratios would mimic respectively P \n\ndesorption for drainage and runoff waters and P desorption from sediments to static waterbodies. \n\nWithin this approach, critical values are (i) 0.1 mg P L-1 for drainage water (EU-WFD, 2000); (ii) \n\n0.05 mg P L-1 for water runoff (Golterman and Oude, 1991) and; 0.02-0.03 mg P L-1 for static \n\nwaterbodies (Correll, 1999). \n\n1.7 - Volcanic ash soils \n\nSoils derived from volcanic materials, also known as Andosols (WRB, 2006), are formed \n\nfrom volcanic ash and cinder deposits. These soils are very light and fluffy, with a high capacity to \n\nretain water, and are rich in amorphous minerals, such as allophones and imogolite that form strong \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n18 \n\n \n\nbonds with organic colloids and P (Shoji et al., 1993; Takahashi and Shoji, 2002). Andosols account \n\nfor nearly 1% of the global land area, but they contain approximately 5% of the global soil organic \n\ncarbon (Eswaran et al., 1993; Batjes, 1996), since these soils tend to accumulate OM in the \n\nsuperficial layers (Takahashi and Shoji, 2002; Dahlgren et al., 2004). On the other hand, cultivated \n\nAndosols need to be fertilized periodically due to its high capacity to sorb P, in order to supply crop \n\nrequirements (Shoji et al., 1993). \n\n1.8 - The Azores archipelago, the Pico island case \n\nAccording to WRB (2006), most of the soils in the Azores archipelago, including Pico \n\nisland, have been classified as Andosols, showing unique properties as defined by their main \n\nphysical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics (Pinheiro et al., 2001). Simultaneously, \n\neutrophication has been reported in several lakes of the Azores, despite the adoption of several \n\nmeasures included on the European Union Water-Framework Directive (Cruz et al., 2015).  \n\nIn S. Miguel Island, Sete-Cidades watershed, Sim\u00f5es (2001) reported values of DPS and \n\nPi-Olsen higher than the threshold values. Also on the same island, but in Furnas watershed, Fontes \n\nand Pinheiro (2016) in studies being conducted presently, observed up to 0.19 mg P L-1 in runoff \n\nwaters, above the environmental threshold value of 0.05 mg L-1. \n\nIn Pico island, about 40 % of the territory is dedicated to dairy livestock, and several \n\nwatersheds have been identified as under environmental risk and P fertilization practices in grazed \n\npastures are associated to those risks (SRAM, 2011). Some examples are the Lagoas Capit\u00e3o, \n\nRosado and Peixinho, where the watersheds are under significant pressure due to the water low \n\nquality of the waterbodies (SRAM, 2011). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n19 \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\nTaking into consideration many of the aspects referred in this introduction, a study was \n\nconducted, using six fertilized grassland soils collected in from commercial farms from Pico island. \n\nIn each soil, the top 15 cm were sampled and divided in five layers. In terms of presentation, the \n\nwork is divided in two parts, which represent the two main chapters of this dissertation. \n\nIn chapter 2, the main objectives were (i) to evaluate the vertical distribution of different Pi \n\npools and (ii) to assess the potential risk of P losses from the soils to the receiving waters, using \n\nthe established chemical parameters referred previously: DPS and P desorption in CaCl2 \n\nsuspensions with high soil:solution ratios. \n\nIn chapter 3, the main objectives were (i) to evaluate the vertical distribution of ?G and AP \n\nactivities in the 15 cm layer of the studied soils, (ii) to assess the stoichiometric enzymatic ratio \n\nand effort for P acquisition in soils derived from volcanic materials, and (iii) stablishing the \n\nrelationship between these enzymes activities, the mineral P fertilization, SOM accumulation and \n\nthe active Al and Fe extracted by ammonium oxalate. \n\n  \n\n\n\n   Chapter 1 - Introduction \n\n20 \n\n \n\n1.9 - References  \n\nAggani, S.

One Haplic Andosol, two Placic Andosols and three Vitric Andosols annually fertilized \n\nwith mineral P were sampled and stratified in five layers (0-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm). The distribution \n\nof different P pools and risk of P loading into receiving waters was assessed by the following analytical \n\ncriteria: inorganic (Pi) and organic P (Po), P-Olsen (Pi-Olsen), P-ammonium lactate (P-AL), P-CaCl2, degree \n\nof phosphorus saturation (DPS) and P concentration on the equilibrium solution of soils in 0.01M CaCl2 \n\nwith ratios of 1: 100, 1: 1000 and 1: 10000. \n\nThe assessed P pools presented in general a decreasing gradient along the soil depth. A P \n\naccumulation of 3.7 g Pt kg\n-1 on the average of the superficial layers (0-1 and 1-2 cm) suggests \n\noverfertilization. The Po and Pi contents represent about 54 and 46 % of total P, respectively, Placic and \n\nHaplic Andosols having a higher Po contribution, and Vitric Andosols a higher Pi contribution. The Placic \n\nand Haplic Andosols present higher organic carbon (OC), Alox and Feox (oxalate extractable) contents than \n\nthe Vitric Andosols, although Alox and Feox values have showed an increase with depth in both soil groups. \n\nThe Vitric Andosols the highest extractable Pi contents assessed by all the extraction methods used, but \n\npresented the lowest extractable Po values evaluated by the Olsen method. \n\nAlthough the Pi-Olsen, P-AL and P-CaCl2 results were above the agronomical threshold values, \n\nnone of the soils presented DPS values above 25 %. On average, Vitric Andosols presented higher values \n\n(14.1 %) than Placic and Haplic Andosols (6.6 %).  \n\nRegarding the assessment of the desorbed P with 0.01M CaCl2 soil electrolyte solution as mimicking \n\ncondition for P in drainage (1: 100), runoff (1: 1000) and static waterbodies (1: 10000), the values \n\ndetermined were in all soils below the respective critical limits, 0.1, 0.05 and 0.02-3 mg P L-1. Although \n\nshowing Pi contents above the agronomical threshold for maximum yield, the results indicate that soil Pi is \n\nstill below the environmental thresholds. Therefore, P desorption from soils do not seem to be the main \n\nsource for waterbodies eutrophication. Since inorganic fertilizers are superficially applied, it must be \n\nconsidered (i) the hypothesis of their direct runoff during rainfall events, before complete dissolution and \n\ninteraction with soil matrix, and (ii), the fertilizer application with deep-banding systems in longer periods \n\nof time as an alternative to the interdiction of the use of fertilizers on the most sensitive and hilly areas of \n\nthe watersheds. \n\n \n\nKey words: Eutrophication; Soil P losses; Degree of Phosphorus Saturation; Andosols. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n29 \n\n \n\n2.2 - Introduction   \n\nPhosphorus (P) is a natural limiting nutrient for plant development, being generally recycled \n\nand retained efficiently due to P-fixing capacity of the soil (Sinaj et al., 2002). The application of \n\nmineral P or animal manure as fertilizer to soil is a common practice to achieve high yields, but the \n\naccumulation and subsequent transfer of P from soil to ground and surface water may be reached \n\nif P is applied in amounts that largely exceed plant needs. Eutrophication of receiving waters caused \n\nby P transfer from the soil is defined as a non-point source pollution (Sharpley et al., 1994). \n\nWater eutrophication is a worldwide environmental problem, related to high nutrients \n\nconcentration in aquatic systems. The transfer of P to surface waters can promote eutrophication at \n\nconcentration levels between 0.02 and 0.035 mg P L-1 (Daniel et al., 1998). The process and amount \n\nof transfer from soil to waters depends on the P desorption from soil constituents. In soils, sorption \n\nby hydroxides and oxides of Al and Fe in surface horizons and subsoils or precipitation with \n\ncalcium can maintain leachate P levels below the eutrophication thresholds (Elliott et al., 1999), \n\nand P leaching is not generally considered as a groundwater problem. However, in P enriched soils, \n\nP leaching may become a serious risk for the environment (De Bolle et al., 2013). Usually, runoff \n\nis the main process involved in the P transport associated to nonpoint sources of water pollution \n\n(Parry, 1998). The intensive use of inorganic and organic fertilizers is responsible for a nutrient \n\naccumulation, mainly at the soil surface (Sharpley et al., 2001), especially in no-till systems (Laflen \n\nand Tabatabai, 1984), namely in grazed pastures.  Therefore, the soil surface nutrient enrichment \n\nincreases the potential for nutrient loss by runoff (Sharpley et al., 1991). Timing of manure and \n\nmineral fertilizer application relative to runoff event plays a key role in the magnitude of P losses \n\n(Westerman and Overcash, 1980). Immediately following application of P to the soil, its loss \n\npotential sharply increases and then declines over time, as applied P interacts with the soil \n\ncomponents and is converted from soluble to recalcitrant forms (Edwards and Daniel, 1993). \n\nHowever, losses are also related to other factors such as characteristics of the P source, intensity of \n\nthe rainfall events (Kleinman et al., 2002, 2006) and the period between application and rainfall.  \n\nAs the demand for improved water quality increases, the use of pastures and the associated \n\ndecrease in nutrient loss through soil erosion may become a more attractive land use on dairy farms \n\n(Rotz et al., 2009). Therefore, there is a need to document the potential water quality impact of \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n30 \n\n \n\npastures and to estimate this impact relative to other land uses. Significant research to monitor N \n\nand P loss in runoff from grazed pasture have been conducted, however to a lesser extent when \n\ncompared to nutrient loss from cultivated cropland (Vadas et al., 2015). \n\nVarious approaches have been used to estimate the environmental risk induced by soil P \n\ndesorption. Van der Zee et al. (1988) proposed the \u2018\u2018Degree of P Saturation\u2019\u2019 (DPS), expressed as \n\nthe ratio between the amount of P desorbed from the soil and the soil P Sorption Capacity (PSC), \n\nas estimated by ammonium oxalate extraction. The PSC is a measure of the potential P sorption by \n\nthe major P-sorbing components in acid soils matrix: the organic Al and Fe complexes and the \n\npoorly crystalline Al and Fe hydroxides and oxides (Freese et al., 1992). DPS relates the P sorbed \n\nto PSC, and the increase of P content in a specific soil leads to the increase of DPS. Therefore, P \n\nenrichment forwards to the loss of soil ability to remove extra P from soil solution due to the \n\nbuildup equilibrium of P sorbed relative to PSC, driving to situations where P can be readily loss \n\nby superficial runoff and internal leaching (Kleinman et al., 1999). A DPS value of 25 % is \n\nconsidered critical, above which P leaching is susceptible to occur (van der Zee et al., 1988). \n\nHowever, for acid sandy soils in Flanders, a critical limit of 35 % was set, and soils with values \n\nbelow 25 % were classified as unsaturated (De Bolle et al., 2013). \n\nOther methods of assessing the risk of P loss to water are based on standard soil P test \n\n(SPT), as Mehlich-3, Olsen, iron oxide\u2013coated paper strips and P-water extraction (Pote et al., \n\n1999). Horta and Torrent (2007a) evaluated the ability of Olsen P method to predict the P release \n\nfrom Portuguese acid soils into waters, achieving an environmental threshold value of 50 mg P kg-\n\n1. Tentatively, an equivalent threshold value for P-ammonium lactate method may be set to 106 mg \n\nP kg-1 for the same type of soils (Horta et al., 2010). Those values derived from SPT are considered \n\nas a change point, above which P losses to receiving waters became unacceptably high. \n\nNevertheless, these values depend not only on the amount of extractable P, but also on the soil type \n\nand desorption situation (Maguire et al., 2005), which may be overcame by the use of DPS index. \n\nTorrent and Delgado (2001) considered that DPS and STP should not be applicable to \n\npredict P loss from all soils. These authors indicate, as an alternative, the use of desorption \n\nprocedures in 0.01 M CaCl2 dilute solutions, with ratios mimicking different environmental \n\nsituations: a ratio of 1: 100 for P internal drainage, 1: 1000 for P runoff and 1: 10000 for the P from \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n31 \n\n \n\nthe sediments at the bottom of static waterbodies. As the critical values for P content in the \n\nequilibrium solutions are: (i) 0.1 mg P L-1 for drainage water (EU-WFD, 2000); (ii) 0.05 mg P L-1 \n\nfor water runoff (Golterman and Oude, 1991); and 0.02-0.03 mg P L-1 for static waterbodies \n\n(Correll, 1999). Above the referred values, a declining of water quality and risk of eutrophication \n\nmay occur. \n\nThe majority of the soils in the Azores archipelago have been classified, according to WRB \n\n(2006), as Andosols, showing unique properties as defined by their main physical, chemical and \n\nmineralogical characteristics (Pinheiro et al., 2001). These soils originated from volcanic glass \n\nmaterials such as ashes, cinders and pumice and evolving under specific environmental conditions, \n\nare dominated by imogolite, ferrihydrite, allophanes and Al/Fe-humus components (Garc\u00eda-Rodeja \n\net al., 2007).  \n\nEutrophication has been reported in several lakes of the Azores  and despite the adoption \n\nof several measures, the European Union Water-Framework Directive failed (Cruz et al., 2015). \n\nValues higher than the threshold indices (DPS and Pi-Olsen) for the Sete-Cidades watershed in S. \n\nMiguel island were reported by Sim\u00f5es (2001). Results showed that Pi-Olsen and the DPS were \n\nhighly related (r > 0.92***) and the author indicates a threshold value for Pi-Olsen of 58 mg P kg\n-\n\n1 for a 25 % DPS, well above the agronomical Pi-Olsen critical value of 25 mg P kg\n-1.  \n\nConsidering that low soil nutrient availability limits net primary production (Campo and \n\nVazquez-Yanes, 2004) in Andosols, mineral fertilizers have widely been used to enhance soil \n\nfertility and improve production yields. However, a large proportion of added P is adsorbed onto \n\nthe surfaces of Al and Fe oxides becoming less available for plant uptake (Takeda et al., 2009), \n\nwhich often leads to situations of P over-fertilization. Simultaneously, in Pico island, where 40 % \n\nof the territory is dedicated to dairy livestock, several watersheds have been identified as under \n\nhigh environmental risk and fertilization practices in grazed pastures are associated to those risks \n\n(SRAM, 2011). \n\nAssuming that agriculture is a non-point water polluter, it was hypothesized that high \n\ncontents of the different soil inorganic P pools should be the main source of loaded P into \n\nfreshwaters. Therefore, the specific aims of the present work were to study (i) the vertical P \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n32 \n\n \n\ndistribution in six soils dedicated to grazed pasture and regularly fertilized at the surface, (ii) to \n\nassess the risks of P losses from these soils by desorption methodologies and DPS values, and (iii) \n\nto identify possible practices which may decrease the potential environmental impacts of livestock \n\nproduction on the freshwater quality. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n33 \n\n \n\n2.3 - Materials and methods \n\n2.3.1 - Soil classification and land management \n\nSix soils from the Pico island, Azores archipelago, were selected.

(1987) and pH \n\nin suspension of 1:2.5, soil:water (Table 2.1). To obtain DPS values, Pox, Feox and Alox were \n\nextracted with ammonium-oxalate-oxalic acid (Schwertmann, 1964). Feox and Alox determinations \n\nin the extracts were performed by atomic absorption spectrometry (Thermo Scientific ICE 3000 \n\nSeries AA Spectrometer).

Before the \n\nexperiment, the soil was finely ground (&lt;1 mm) and thoroughly homogenized. Mimicking \n\nconditions of drainage, runoff and large waterbodies standing over soil sediment (e.g. lakes and \n\nreservoirs), 1: 100, 1: 1000 and 1: 10000 soil: solution ratios were used (Torrent and Delgado, \n\n2001) with 0.01M CaCl2 as the supporting electrolyte solution. Considering that the very superficial \n\nsoil layers are the main source for soil erosion and P-runoff, the 1: 10000 suspension methodology \n\nwas only conducted for the top samples (0-1 cm) and 1: 1000 suspensions were conducted for the \n\ntwo more superficial samples (0-1 and 1-2 cm). The soil suspensions were placed in polyethylene \n\nbottles, at 25\u00b0C, and shaken for 30 min each on the two first days, and then once a week. After the \n\n30-d period, portions of each suspension were filtrated (0.2 \u00b5m) and P contents in the solution was \n\ndetermined. P content on the extracts or digestates were determined by the molybdate-ascorbic acid \n\nblue method (Coutinho, 1996) in a segmented flow analyser (SanPlus, Skalar, Breda, NL) after a \n\ndialysis step to prevent interference from color and solids in suspension. \n\n2.3.5 - Statistical analysis \n\nWeighted means in each profile were calculated taking into consideration the different \n\nthickness of each layer.

With the exception of soils IV and V, the contents decrease \n\nalong the soil profiles, (Table 2.3). This P stratification may be explained by several causes, \n\nnamely: P inorganic fertilization, and strong P interactions with the soil matrix in the superficial \n\nlayers (Tiecher et al., 2012). \n\nThe six soils under study present also a strong Pi-Olsen decreasing stratification (Figure \n\n2.1), along the profile, with the exception of Soil VI, which was never tilled. The Pi-Olsen values \n\nranged between 112 and 2 mg P kg-1, being the overall average of the top 15 cm of about 39 mg P \n\nkg-1. Soils III and V presented, respectively, the lowest (9 mg P kg-1) and the highest (77 mg P kg-\n\n1) Pi-Olsen weighed average contents. Using 51 soils from Azores, Ferreira el al. (2012) assessed \n\nan agronomic critical value of 20 mg Pi-Olsen kg\n-1 for grazing grass species. As it can be seen in \n\nFigure 2.1, the weighted average of Pi-Olsen in the studied soils equals or surpassed that value, \n\nexcept for Soil III, indicating that most of the pasture soils may be over-fertilized, with both \n\neconomic and environmental negative consequences. Similar observations were reported by \n\nSim\u00f5es (2001) for fertilized pasture soils of the Sete Cidades watershed (S. Miguel island \u2013 \n\nAzores), where an abrupt decrease of Pi-Olsen in the deepest layer (10-25 cm) was observed. Just \n\nas for Pi, Rodrigues et al. (2016) also reported an enrichment of labile Pi in the 0-5 cm layer in a \n\nno-till system, as result of the accumulation of P fertilizer and crop residues. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n37 \n\n \n\nTable 2.3 - Soil P parameters obtained from the extracted P-CaCl2, total and mineral Phosphorus (Pt and Pi) content \n\nand ammonium oxalate extractable Phosphorus (Pox), Aluminum (Alox) and Iron (Feox). \n\nsoil   layer   P-CaCl2   Pt  Pi  Pox  Alox  Feox  \n\n    cm   mg P kg-1   g P kg-1  mmol kg-1 \n\nI \n\n 0 - 1  0.4  4.0  1.3  93  1219  190  \n\n 1 - 2  0.3  4.0  1.2  86  1273  186  \n\n 2 - 5  &lt;0.01  3.7  1.1  83  1498  187  \n\n 5 - 10  &lt;0.01  2.8  0.7  60  1470  207  \n\n 10 - 15  &lt;0.01  2.0  0.3  27  1677  192  \n\n    weighted average   0.04   2.8   0.7   58   1515   196   \n\nII \n\n 0 - 1  0.2  3.9  1.3  89  1182  136  \n\n 1 - 2  &lt;0.01  3.8  1.2  87  1721  148  \n\n 2 - 5  &lt;0.01  3.6  1.2  91  1663  154  \n\n 5 - 10  &lt;0.01  2.6  0.8  65  1653  188  \n\n 10 - 15  &lt;0.01  2.3  0.7  53  1658  138  \n\n    weighted average   0.01   2.9   0.9   69   1630   158   \n\nIII \n\n 0 - 1  0.1  3.2  0.9  72  1360  167  \n\n 1 - 2  &lt;0.01  3.1  0.8  71  1334  161  \n\n 2 - 5  &lt;0.01  2.8  0.8  63  1849  192  \n\n 5 - 10  &lt;0.01  2.1  0.6  46  2120  196  \n\n 10 - 15  &lt;0.01  1.6  0.5  40  1940  173  \n\n    weighted average   0.01   2.2   0.6   58   1903   183   \n\nIV \n\n 0 - 1  2.8  2.7  2.0  69  693  70  \n\n 1 - 2  1.1  2.5  1.9  70  704  69  \n\n 2 - 5  0.8  2.7  2.2  80  737  77  \n\n 5 - 10  0.5  2.4  1.9  55  820  76  \n\n 10 - 15  0.2  1.8  1.3  46  887  79  \n\n    weighted average   0.65   2.2   1.7   59   809   76   \n\nV \n\n 0 - 1  6.3  4.0  2.8  70  690  52  \n\n 1 - 2  3.6  4.2  3.1  87  739  67  \n\n 2 - 5  1.2  3.6  2.9  91  825  70  \n\n 5 - 10  0.3  2.8  2.2  79  965  80  \n\n 10 - 15  &lt;0.01  2.7  1.7  62  1129  78  \n\n    weighted average   0.99   3.1   2.3   76   958   74   \n\nVI \n\n 0 - 1  2.3  3.6  1.2  81  1220  92  \n\n 1 - 2  0.6  3.7  1.4  87  950  103  \n\n 2 - 5  0.4  3.4  1.3  81  883  110  \n\n 5 - 10  0.2  3.0  1.2  78  1151  135  \n\n 10 - 15  0.1  2.6  1  74  1028  131  \n\n  weighted average  0.37  3.1  1.2  78  1048  124  \n\n    overall mean   0.34   2.7   1.2   65   1310   135   \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n38 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 - Profile stratification of Pi-Olsen (mg P kg\n-1) in the top 15 cm layer of the six soils studied; weighted \n\naverage in solid line and agronomical threshold level in dashed line \n\nConcerning Egner-Rhiem method, the six soils have a P-AL distribution similar to Pi-Olsen, \n\nwith a decreasing content of extractable P along the profile. The P-AL (Figure 2.2) content ranged \n\nbetween 227 and 1 mg P kg-1.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n39 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.2 - Profile stratification of P-AL (mg P kg-1) in the top 15 cm layer of the six soils studied; weighted average \n\nin solid line and agronomical threshold level in dashed line. \n\nSimilarly, to Olsen extraction, soils III and V presented, respectively, the lowest (7.7 mg P \n\nkg-1) and the highest (73.7 mg P kg-1) P-AL contents on the weighted average of the top 15 cm. \n\nAlthough less adapted to this conditions as a STP (Ferreira el al., 2012), P-AL values also \n\ndemonstrate that some soils may be over-fertilized, taking into consideration the agronomical \n\ncritical value of 18 mg P kg-1 indicated by the same authors. \n\nThe extraction of soluble P-CaCl2 in a 1: 10 soil: solution ratio (Table 2.3), also used as soil \n\nfertility diagnostic tool (Houba et al., 1990), showed that only the top layer (0-1 cm) presents \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n40 \n\n \n\ndetectable P content in all soils, ranging from &lt;0.01 to 6.29 mg P kg-1. Only soils IV and VI had \n\ndetectable P-CaCl2 in all the layers. S\u00e1nchez-Alcal\u00e1 et al. (2014) observed that soil suspensions in \n\n0.01M CaCl2 may underestimate the P contents in soil solution due to the ionic strength and \n\npresence of Ca ion on P adsorption, being this effect more pronounced in calcareous soils. The \n\nsame authors also observed that the P-CaCl2 values tend to decrease with the increase of soil buffer \n\ncapacity, as the case of the soils derived from volcanic ashes. Therefore, this underestimation needs \n\nto be under consideration when soil P status is assessed with 0.01M CaCl2. \n\nAll the extraction methods used for assessing labile Pi are related and were compared among \n\neach other (Figure 2.3) and some considerations may be pointed out based on the results. As \n\nobserved by the data presented by Horta et al. (2010) for acidic non-volcanic soils, the relationship \n\nbetween Pi-Olsen and P-AL is in fact curvilinear, revealing a possible underestimation of labile Pi \n\nby Olsen method for soils with high contents of extractable P (> 100 mg Pi-Olsen kg\n-1). This effect \n\nmay be due to soil: solution ratio that leads to the supersaturation of the extraction medium, \n\nallowing an incomplete dissolution and/or P re-adsorption to the solid phases (Horta and Torrent, \n\n2007b). Even with a similar 1: 20 ratio, AL method may overcome this drawback, since lactate \n\nanion can replace the displaced P on the solid phases, reducing the re-adsorption phenomenon \n\n(Thomas and Peaslee, 1973). Studying soils with andic properties from Azores archipelago, \n\nAuxtero and Madeira (2008) found an highly significant correlation (r = 0.77***) between both \n\nmethods, but all the samples presented values ? 100 mg P kg-1. On the other hand, both Olsen and \n\nAL extraction results in the studied soils showed similar or even higher correlations with the Pi \n\ncontents (r = 0.96*** and 0.85***, respectively) than between them (r = 0.84***).  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n41 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 - Relationship between soil solution soluble P and extractable P: (a) Pi-Olsen versus P-AL (p &lt;0.001, n = \n\n30); (b) P-CaCl2 versus Pi-Olsen (p &lt;0.001, n = 20); (c) P-CaCl2 versus P-AL (p &lt;0.001, n = 20). \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n42 \n\n \n\nThis observation may reflect the different pools of Pi extracted by both methods (Thomas and \n\nPeaslee, 1973). Therefore, it is expectable a high level of correlation between Pi-Olsen and P-AL \n\nfor homogeneous groups of soils, just as in the present work and the cited studies. However, for \n\nsets of soils with a high range of pH, parent material, OC, clay, and calcium carbonate, the \n\ncorrelation seems to be nonexistent (r = 0.38ns), as observed by Fernandes et al. (1999). \n\nAlthough linear relationships between soluble P-CaCl2 and extractable Pi-Olsen or P-AL \n\nare significant, data fits better to a logarithmical model as shown in Figure 4b and 4c, with Pearson \n\ncoefficient of  0.79*** for Pi-Olsen and r = 0.86*** for P-AL. Hue and Fox (2010), also for \n\nvolcanic soils but with a much larger range of values, found a higher correlation between log P-\n\nCaCl2 and Pi-Olsen (r = 0.95***).  \n\n2.4.2 - Extractable Alox and Feox \n\nRegarding the Alox and Feox contents, defined as an andic property for Andosols, their values \n\nare higher in the group of the Haplic and Placic Andosols (Soils I, II and III) than in the group of \n\nVitric Andosols (Soils IV, V and VI), in accordance with their relative degree of pedogenetic \n\ndevelopment. In terms of weighed averages, Soil III presents the highest Alox content and soil IV \n\nthe smallest content, with values of 1903 and 809 mmol Alox kg\n-1 respectively. Regarding Feox, \n\nSoil I presents the highest content and soil V the smallest content, with values of 196 and 74 mmol \n\nFeox kg\n-1, respectively (Table 2.3). Both values increase with depth, in accordance with the \n\nobservations of Pinheiro et al. (2001) along the complete profile of Andosols from Azores. Contents \n\nof Alox and Feox have negative correlations with Pi (r = -0.80*** and -0.83***, respectively). \n\nContents of Pox decrease with soil depth (Table 2.3), just as with all the other forms of \n\nmineral P. Nevertheless, Pox has no significant correlation with P-AL, and is poorly correlated \n\neither with Pi and Pi-Olsen (r = 0.48* and 0.52*, respectively). The highest correlation is observed \n\nwith Pt (r = 0.87***), since Pox includes mineral and organic forms of P due to the previous acid \n\ndigestion conducted before P determination. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n43 \n\n \n\n2.4.3 - Risk assessment indices \n\nConcerning the indices of risk assessment for P losses, the highest and the lowest weighed \n\nmeans for DPS index were observed in Soils V and III, with values of 15.2 % and 5.1 %, \n\nrespectively, although these values do not reflect the situation of the most superficial layers. The \n\nDPS values showed an accentuated decrease trend along the profile of the studied soils, with the \n\nexception for soil VI (Figure 2.4). For instance, the layer 1-5 cm of Soil V presents a value of 21 \n\n% and layers 0-2 cm of Soil III present a value of 9 % for DPS. Nevertheless, and as it can be \n\nconfirmed in Figure 5, none of the studied soils reach the critical values of 25 % or 35 % pointed \n\nout by van der Zee et al. (1988) and De Bolle et al. (2013) for risks of P losses into the environment. \n\nGenerally, the group of Haplic and Placic Andosols presents much lower values of DPS, \n\nwith an overall mean of 6.6 %, as a result of their higher content of Alox and Feox, with the highest \n\nvalues being observed at the most superficial layer (0-1 cm). On the opposite, the group of Vitric \n\nAndosols presents a much higher value of DPS (14 % for the overall mean), and the highest values \n\nare observed in the layers between 1 and 5 cm. \n\nConsidering the formula of DPS and that PR is a result of Al and Fe soil components of \n\nthese soils, it is observed a negative relationship between DPS and PR (r = -0.77***, n = 30). \n\nNevertheless, and as shown in Figure 2.4, this general correlation is not effective to predict DPS \n\nfrom PR values, since Haplic and Placic Andosols and Vitric Andosols show a different behavior. \n\nHaplic and Placic Andosols present values of PR near 100 %, with a small range of variation, \n\nalthough with a clear relationship with the low values of DPS (r = -0.84***, n = 15). Meanwhile, \n\nthe relationship for the Vitric Andosols is less meaningful (r = -0.46, n = 15), in spite of the larger \n\nvariation in PR values. \n\nAlthough Pox and Pi are poorly correlated, as previously refereed, a very close relationship \n\nis observed between Pi and DPS (r = 0.90***), with no segregation among the samples from Haplic \n\nand Placic Andosols or Vitric Andosols. From our results, a general threshold value of 3.0 g Pi kg\n-\n\n1 can be set for soils with identical characteristics, in order to maintain their DPS value below 25 \n\n%, the more conservative critical value referred in the literature. Significant correlations can be \n\nalso observed between DPS and Pi-Olsen (r = 0.90***) or P-AL results (r = 0.79***). Particularly \n\nfor Pi-Olsen, the relationship is presented in Figure 2.5, where it can be observed again that no \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n44 \n\n \n\nsegregation occurs among the studied Haplic and Placic Andosols and the Vitric Andosols. Based \n\non the available data and on a critical value for DPS of 25 %, a threshold value of 135 mg P kg-1 \n\nfor extractable Pi-Olsen can be estimated for these soils. This value is well above the threshold \n\nvalue of 50 mg P kg-1 proposed by Horta and Torrent (2007a) for a batch of soils with different \n\ncharacteristics, namely with much lower P retention capacity. \n\n \nFigure 2.4 - Degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS) profile stratification of the top 15 cm layer of the six soils studied; \n\nsolid line 25 % conservative critical value (van der Zee et al., 1988) and in dashed line the 35 % critical value for acid \n\nsoils used by De Bolle et al. (2013). \n\nTherefore, it should be accepted that specific threshold value need to be set for different \n\nsoil units. Furthermore, this environmental threshold value of 135 mg P kg-1 for extractable Pi-\n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n45 \n\n \n\nOlsen is also well above the agronomical critical value of 20 mg P kg-1 for extractable Pi-Olsen \n\n(Ferreira et al., 2012), which means that environmental protection for P does not necessary means \n\nlimitations on plant nutrition and production.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 - Correlation between Pi-Olsen versus Degree of P Saturation (DPS), in solid line the critical DPS limit of \n\n25 % (van der Zee et al., 1988) and in dashed line 35 % used by De Bolle et al. (2013). \n\nA significant correlation between DPS and P-CaCl2 was also observed (r = 0.56**, n = 20). \n\nFor a conservative DPS value of 25 %, above which there are concerns for P losses, a threshold P-\n\nCaCl2 value of 8.8 mg P kg\n-1 (equivalent to 0.88 mg P L-1) was assessed. Once more, this value is \n\nabove the agronomic threshold value of 0.2 mg P L-1, proposed by Fox and Kamprath (1970) for \n\nmaximum yield. Although in same layers of the Vitric Andosols P-CaCl2 values were above the \n\nreferred agronomic threshold, the individual weighted average of the 15 cm soil depth in all the six \n\nsoils were below 0.1 mg P L-1 (Table 2.3). Hue and Fox (2010), in Hawaiian volcanic ash derived \n\nsoils, also reported a maximum 95 % yield, achieved when the soil P solution was above 0.2 mg P \n\nL-1. When compiling information about different crops, the same authors reported agronomic \n\ncritical values of 0.1 and 0.3 mg P L-1 for some pasture species (ryegrass and white clover, \n\nrespectively). Nevertheless, it must be re-stated that P-CaCl2 values may be underestimated in soils \n\nwith high buffer capacity (S\u00e1nchez-Alcal\u00e1 et al., 2014), just as the soils under study. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n46 \n\n \n\n2.4.4 - Desorption risk assessment \n\nThe P desorption in 0.01M CaCl2 with a soil: solution ratio 1: 100 is intended to assess the \n\nP internal drainage, and consequently (i) the risk of ground waters contamination, but also (ii) the \n\nreadiness of leaching of superficial applied P along the soils profile. Considering the critical P \n\nvalue for drainage waters as 0.1 mg P L-1 (EU-WFD, 2000), none of the soils seem to be of concern \n\nto groundwater contamination. Once more, soil V presented the highest detectable value, 0.08 mg \n\nP L-1 in the most superficial layer (Table 2.4). The available results also show the marked \n\nimmobility of P, justifying its accumulation in the superficial layers and not leading to its \n\nredistribution along the soil profiles when P is applied with no incorporation. \n\nAssessing the risk of superficial P runoff from soils, only 0-1 and 1-2 cm layers were \n\nconsidered for the essay at the ratio 1:1000. Soils II and III had undetectable desorbed P (&lt;0.01 \n\nmg P L-1) and soil V presented, again, the higher desorbed P content, 0.04 and 0.02 mg P L-1. \n\nTherefore, the same observation can be made as for the leaching risk assessment. None of the soils \n\nseems to be of concern for P desorption for the water flowing through the superficial layers, since \n\nthe critical limit for P runoff is established for 0.05 mg P L-1 (Golterman and Oude, 1991).  \n\nAssuming that the soil particles are more easily eroded from the very surficial layers, \n\ngenerating sediment accumulation in the interior waterbodies, the essay with the 1:10000 ratios \n\nwas only conducted for the 0-1 cm depth. Considering the critical limit of 0.025 - 0.03 mg P L-1 \n\n(Correll, 1999), above which water eutrophication can be promoted, the risk of the P desorption \n\nfrom sediments at the bottom of waterbodies was not detected for the particles from the soils under \n\nstudy. According to the obtained results, only soil V presents a P content above the detection limit \n\n(0.01 mg P L-1), as it can be observed in Table 2.4. \n\nAccording to Yli-Halla et al. (2002), the loading P potential from soil is easily \n\nunderestimated if an insufficiently strong sink is used. In general, the amount of desorbed P \n\nincrease with the decrease of the soil: solution ratio. As it can be observed in Table 2.4, when the \n\nsink is enlarged, by increasing the volume of electrolyte solution, and the size of soil sample \n\nremains constant, the amount of desorbed P increases, despite the decrease of its concentration in \n\nthe equilibrium solution. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n47 \n\n \n\nTable 2.4 - Desorption experiment P values in 0.01M CaCl2 (soil: solution ratio 1: 100, 1: 1000 and 1: 10000 represent \n\nthe risk of P losses through water drainage, runoff and waterbodies, respectively). \n\nConsidering both groups of the soils under study, the observed results for the risk \n\nassessment are once more in concordance with their characteristics.

In soils subjected to high fertilization rates, Horta et al. \n\n(2013) also found higher desorbed P in the superficial horizon. In both cases, some of the values \n\nobserved surpass the environmental critical limits. Nevertheless, these results may be due to the \n\nweak ability of those soils to sorb P, due to the low contents in Fe and Al compounds. \n\nAlthough the obtained values suggest that P associated with the soil components is not an \n\nevident risk for environment, fresh-water eutrophication phenomenon is a reality in the Azores \n\nislands. In studies being conducted presently, in the Furnas watershed, S. Miguel island, Fontes \n\nand Pinheiro (2016), observed up to 0.19 mg P L-1 in runoff waters, being the higher values well \n\nabove the environmental threshold value of 0.05 mg P L-1. Therefore, another mechanism for P \n\nrunoff may be considered, since fertilizers are superficially placed without incorporation. As \n\nrainfall events are common in the region, it must be considered the hypothesis of a direct loading \n\nof the mineral P into the watersheds, risk which is aggravated by the steep slope of many of the \n\nhighland pastures. So, the direct runoff of fertilizers may occur, even before P compounds being \n\ncompletely dissolved and has reacted with the soil matrix. If true, inorganic P fertilization may \n\nhave to be placed through deep-banding systems in longer periods of time, since soil mobilization \n\nis out of question. Simultaneously, this alternative will allow the maintenance of the P inorganic \n\nfertilization and its effective efficiency, since some pasture yields may be limited by shortage of P \n\non sub-superficial layers due to the high retention capacity of the soils. In the case of the Haplic \n\nand Placic Andosols (Figure 2.1 and 2.2), in spite of the high contents of Pi-Olsen on the superficial \n\nlayers, as a result of the fertilization, or even over fertilization, the values presented between 5-15 \n\ncm are below the previously referred agronomical critical value of 20 mg P kg-1 (Ferreira et al., \n\n2012), depth where roots may absorb the majority of the P that pastures species need. Nevertheless, \n\nthis solution will not be effective for the potential risk derived from the faeces superficial \n\ndeposition of the grazing animals, which represents also a high risk for water contamination \n\nthrough direct runoff of particulate organic P during rainfall events. \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n49 \n\n \n\n2.5 - Conclusions   \n\nThe six studied soils presented a stratified gradient along the profile evaluated for the \n\ndifferent P pools assessed. This stratification seems to be consequence both of the superficial \n\napplication of fertilizers without incorporation and the high adsorption capacity of the soils \n\ninducing the P fixation at the surface layers. \n\nThe total Pi decreased along the profile of the studied soils, although the Haplic and Placic \n\nAndosols have a lower contribution of Pi to Pt, in opposition to the Vitric Andosols. The extracted \n\nAlox and Feox showed an inverse distribution to the P pools, increasing with the soil profile depth. \n\nAmong soils, Haplic and Placic Andosols have higher Alox and Feox contents than the Vitric \n\nAndosols. \n\nAlthough the obtained values for P by extracted by the Olsen, ammonium lactate and CaCl2 \n\nmethods are above the agronomical threshold limits, they are still below the environmental \n\nthreshold values estimated either by the desorbed P in 0.01M CaCl2 suspensions or the DSP. The \n\nlatter presents values ranging from 5.1 % to 15.2 %, safely below the more conservative limit of \n\n25 %. Compared with Haplic and Placic Andosols, Vitric Andosols present higher values, closer to \n\nthe environmental limits, due to their lower contents of Alox and Feox extracted by ammonium \n\noxalate as responsible for P adsorption. \n\nThe obtained results point out that P desorption from soil solid phases in these soils is very \n\nlimited and thus may not represent a significant cause of P losses and risk of eutrophication to the \n\nwatersheds of this region. Therefore, the hypothesis of P transport by direct runoff of the \n\nsuperficially applied fertilizers before dissolution and reaction with soil constituents should be \n\nconsidered, especially in the steepest slope pastures. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2 - Vertical distribution and loss risks of phosphorus in soils derived from volcanic materials and altered by fertilized pastures \n\n50 \n\n \n\n2.6 - References \n\nAmano, Y. 1981.

This work aimed to study the effect of the management of soils derived \n\nfrom volcanic materials on the amounts and vertical distribution of organic carbon, organic phosphorus (P) \n\nand acid phosphatase (AP) and ?-glucosidase (?G) activities, in the 15 cm top layers of six pasture soils.  \n\nIt was observed a superficial accumulation of organic carbon (OC) and organic P pools, correlated \n\nwith ammonium oxalate extractable Aluminum (Alox) and Iron (Feox) contents, particularly with Feox. The \n\naccumulated OC and Po were both correlated with the stratified gradients of the enzymes activities. AP was \n\nnot subjected to inhibition promoted by inorganic P fertilization. On the contrary, and considering all the 30 \n\nsoil samples, AP activity showed a positive linear relationship (r = 0.57**) with Pi. \n\nThe stoichiometric relationship between both enzymes presented high values for the AP: ?G activity \n\nratio. These results suggest a high energy allocation effort of microbial communities to ensure P acquisition \n\nfor homeostasis maintenance. The AP: ?G ratios were higher in soils with high Alox and Feox contents, \n\nnamely Haplic and Placic Andosols (between 10.7 and 14.7). The potential C:P acquisition values were \n\nbelow the 0.95 global average in both group of soils (between 0.74 and 0.91), presenting a high inverse \n\ncorrelation with Alox+Feox content (r = -0.90***, n = 30). These results suggest that the effort for P \n\nacquisition (AP: ?G) and the potential of C:P acquisition (ln(?G):ln(AP)) are both affected by the size of \n\nthe Pi pools and by Al and Fe contents. If available Pi exists at levels able to supply growth requirements \n\nand ensure homeostasis condition, the energy allocation to produce AP enzymes decreases. Although, as Pi \n\nretention increases due to high Al and Fe minerals contents, energy allocation shifts to the production of AP \n\nenzymes to mineralize soil Po. Moreover, the average C:P molar ratio of the six soils was below (115) the \n\nvalue proposed for pasture soils (166), above which soils may present low P availability. \n\nNevertheless, the present work do not allow a clear justification for the OC accumulation in the \n\nstudied soils, since Al and Fe compounds are simultaneously related with different soil parameters. \n\nTherefore, several hypotheses may be considered: (i) the ability of Al and Fe compounds to bound and \n\nprotect organic molecules from mineralization; (ii) the low ?G activity, which seems to be depressed by Al \n\nand Fe compounds affecting the rate of the OC mineralization; (iii) the high demand of energy for P \n\nacquisition due to the intense Pi retention on the Al and Fe compounds, which shifts the allocation of cell \n\nresources in detriment of microbe growth, limiting the size of the soil microbial biomass compartment. \n\n \n\nKey words: Soil Organic Matter; Organic Phosphorus; Andosol; Acid phosphatase; ?-glucosidase; \n\nEcological stoichiometry; P acquisition effort. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n56 \n\n \n\n3.2 - Introduction \n\nThe recovering process of key nutrients from residue inputs and accumulated soil organic \n\nmatter (SOM) is an essential microbial function in soils. Generally, these fluxes require the activity \n\nof extracellular enzymes to process the complex compounds of organic matter into assimilable \n\nsubunits (Caldwell, 2005). Since enzyme activities can be reliably determined in laboratory, have \n\nmicrobial ecological significance, are sensitive to environmental stress and respond rapidly to \n\nchanges in land management, the use of soil extracellular enzymes as biological indicators is of \n\ngreat interest (Dick, 1997). Nevertheless, these essays measure the potential activity of the enzymes \n\n(Vmax) and not their actual activities, since the conditions in the laboratory (pH, temperature, \n\nsubstrate concentration, and diffusion coefficients) are different from those occurring in situ \n\n(Nannipieri et al., 2002). \n\nAndosols are known to display unique morphological, physical and chemical properties \n\nattributed to the components of their amorphous fraction, like allophane, imogolite, ferrihydrite \n\nand Al/Fe\u2013humus complexes (Shoji et al., 1993), accompanied by a high capacity to adsorb P, \n\nwhich may affect its agronomic use. Volcanic ash soils usually also contain high amounts of \n\norganic matter (OM) (Batjes, 1996). Although comprising only 0.84 % of the global land area, \n\nthese soils store approximately 5,0 % of the global soil C (Eswaran et al., 1993; Dahlgren et al., \n\n2004). The hypotheses that can explain SOM accumulations in Andosols are: (i) P is a rate-limiting \n\nfactor for OM mineralization (Buurman et al., 2007) attributed to the large P-fixing capacity of \n\nthese soils; (ii) biodegradation of SOM is limited by its complexation with Fe, Al and allophanic \n\nconstituents  (Matus et al., 2014); (iii) enzymes and microbial by-products may be deactivated by \n\nadsorption on short-range order mineral surfaces of andic soils (Saggar et al., 1994); (iv) the \n\nmicrobial decomposition of OM may be limited by low pH values and Al toxicity (Tate and Theng, \n\n1980) especially in non-allophanic Andosols. In Andosols, the formation of metal\u2013humus \n\ncomplexes with SOM leaves little or no Al available to be limiting for microbes and plants (Shoji \n\nand Masui, 1972). \n\nSOM fuels the metabolic activity beneath soil surface (Bauer and Black, 1994) and is an \n\nimportant indicator of soil quality and productivity (Reeves, 1997). The potential activities of \n\nextracellular enzymes are important indicators nutrient availabilities in soils. Since the synthesis \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n57 \n\n \n\nof extracellular ?-glucosidase and phosphatases represents a large metabolic investment, their \n\nproduction is induced when labile C and/or inorganic phosphorus (P), respectively, are in short \n\nsupply (Zheng et al., 2015). Consequently, enzyme production and release from cells can be \n\ndepressed or induced by genetic expression according to environmental signals (Sinsabaugh and \n\nShah, 2012). Soil P concentrations regulate the phosphatase activity through Pi signal transduction \n\npathway (PHO), a mechanism linked to cellular P homeostasis (Dick et al., 2011). Phosphatase \n\nsynthesis is regulated throughout the growth phase of microbial cells and is influenced by \n\nexogenous and endogenous P pools (Persson et al., 2003). Phosphatase activity is repressed in non-\n\nlimiting P medium, but once exogenous P content is limiting, phosphatase mRNA and \n\nphosphatases synthesis are induced (Dick et al., 2011).  \n\nThe exoenzyme ?-glucosidase  (?G) plays a major role in degradation of carbohydrates in \n\nsoils and its synthesis is induced by the products of cellulose breakdown, including cellobiose, \n\nglucose and their metabolites (Stewart and Leatherwood, 1976). Research has shown that ?G is the \n\nmost abundant and easily detectable of the three enzymes (endo-1,4-glucanase, exo-1,4-glucanase \n\nand ?-D-glucosidase) involved in cellulose degradation in soil, and is rarely substrate limited, thus \n\nmaking it ideal to examine the importance of physico-chemical controls on the turnover of SOM \n\n(Turner et al., 2002). Therefore, ?G activity has been used to closely monitor rapid changes in soil \n\norganic C associated with soil management effects (Bandick and Dick, 1999). On the other hand, \n\n?G contributes to provide energy for soil microorganisms and is directly related to soil organic C \n\ncontent (Eivazi and Tabatabai, 1988; Bandick and Dick, 1999). This enzyme catalyzes the cleavage \n\nof one mole of cellobiose in two moles of glucose, regulating the supply of energy for \n\nmicroorganisms, which are unable to take up cellobiose directly. Alef and Nannipieri (1995) \n\nreferred that ?G activity may be the rate-limiting step in cellulose degradation. \n\nRegarding phosphatases, the name includes a broad group of enzymes that catalyze the \n\nhydrolysis of both esters and anhydrides of phosphoric acid (Schmidt and Laskowski, 1961). Acid \n\nphosphatases (AP) and alkaline phosphatases are phosphoric monoester hydrolases with optimal \n\nactivities in acid and alkaline environments, whereas phosphodiesterase is a phosphoric diester \n\nhydrolase. All these three enzymes act on ester bonds (Deng and Tabatabai, 1997). Phosphatases \n\nplay a key role in soil P cycling by catalyzing mineralization of organic P and contributing to the \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n58 \n\n \n\nincreasing of soil P bioavailability. Like any exoenzyme molecule, phosphomonoesterases diffuse \n\npoorly into the soil matrix (Lefebvre et al., 1990) and their activities are dependent of different \n\nparameters such as soil characteristics, microorganism, plant cover, inputs and the presence of \n\ninhibitors or activators (Speir and Ross, 1978). Generally, it is assumed that phosphomonoesterases \n\nactivity is dependent on the enzymes associated with viable or lysed microbial cells, root-released \n\nenzymes into the rhizosphere and detritosphere soil (Nannipieri, 1994), although root-released \n\nenzymes probably mineralize organic P from sloughed off or damaged cells rather than from native \n\nsoil organic P (Lefebvre et al. 1990). Nevertheless, the major contribution to its activity in soil is \n\ndue to the extracellular enzymes stabilized by colloids (Nannipieri, 2011). In volcanic soils, \n\nminerals such as allophane and ferrihydrite showed evidences of soil enzymes protection, namely \n\nAP and ?G, and other enzymes appear to be sorbed in the soil minerals without discrimination of \n\nthe enzyme type (Allison, 2006). \n\nFertilization affects soil biochemical and biological properties (Liang et al., 2014), and the \n\ninfluence of external nutrient inputs on soil microbial ecology has been frequently emphasized (Ai \n\net al., 2012). As an example, PO4\n3- is a competitive inhibitor of both phosphomonoesterases in soils \n\n(Juma and Tabatabai, 1978), although the absence of response of phosphatase activities to P \n\naddition has been also reported (Schneider et al., 2001). On the other hand, N fertilization generally \n\nincreases the activity of phosphatases in soils (Marklein and Houlton, 2012). \n\nRegarding the equilibrium between C and P availability, Sinsabaugh et al. (2010) found an \n\naverage value of 1.6 for the ratio of acid phosphatase to ?-glucosidase activities in 40 different \n\nsoils with no andic characteristics. Nevertheless, in a long-term field experiment on an Andosol, \n\nMoro et al. (2015) observed an increase from 3.9 to 9.5 of the same ratio when no P was added or \n\nwhen P was limiting plant growth. Accordingly, the value of this ratio seems to reflect, even for \n\ncrops, the variable readiness for acquiring phosphorus in soils with different P retention capacity \n\nor with different mineral P (or N) fertilizations. \n\nMineral fertilizers are widely used in the Azores region to enhance soil fertility and improve \n\npasture production, particularly P fertilization due to the high contents of active fractions of Al and \n\nFe and consequent high P retention capacity of the soils. Consequently, it was hypothesized that \n\nthe abundant presence of Al and Fe active minerals may present a specific role on the relationships \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n59 \n\n \n\namong soil OC, P enrichment and their effects over the activity of free AP and BG enzymes in \n\nthese particular soils. Therefore, the specific aims of this work were: (i) to evaluate the stratification \n\n?G and AP activities in the 15 cm superficial layer of six Andosols collected in Azores (Pico Island) \n\nunder cattle grazed pasture and fertilization over the past 20 years, and; (ii) to study the \n\nrelationships among both enzymes, SOM accumulation and inorganic P fertilization; and (iii) \n\nassess the effect of Al and Fe active minerals in ?G and AP activities and P acquisition effort. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n60 \n\n \n\n3.3 - Materials and methods \n\n3.3.1 - Soil classification and land management \n\nSix soils, from commercial farms, in Pico island of the Azores archipelago, located between \n\n200 and 700m of altitude, were selected. Soil I is a Haplic Andosol, II and III are Placic Andosol \n\nand IV, V and VI are Leptic Vitric Andosol, according to WRB (2006) classification. Soils I and \n\nVI were never tilled and the remaining ones have not been tilled for more than 20 years. All soils \n\nare under pastures use, being fertilized annually. \n\n3.3.2 - Soil Sampling \n\nA superficial layer of 15 cm was selected in each location and then subdivided in 5 sub-\n\nlayers (0-1, 1-2, 2-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm) making a total of 30 soil samples, for the six sites. Samples \n\nwere air-dried, sieved through a 2-mm screen, and stored for the analysis, which were conducted \n\nin duplicate.  \n\n3.3.3 - Soil Analysis \n\nPhosphate retention (PR, %) was assessed according to Blackmore et al. (1987), organic \n\ncarbon (OC) through NIRD in elemental analyzer (Primac SC, Skalar; Breda, NL), and pH in a \n\n1:2.5, soil-water suspension. Actives Fe and Al were extracted according to the ammonium-\n\noxalate-oxalic acid method (Schwertmann et al., 1964) and quantifications in the extracts were \n\nperformed by atomic absorption spectrometry (Thermo Scientific ICE 3000 Series AA \n\nSpectrometer), their individual values are presented in chapter 2.  \n\n3.3.4 - P characterization \n\nTotal P (Pt) was determined after ignition (550\u00b0C/2h), by extracting 2g of air dried soil \n\n(1:25 soil-solution/16h) with 0.5M H2SO4. Inorganic P (Pi) was determined after extracting 2g of \n\nair dried soil (1:25 soil-solution/16h) with 0.5M H2SO4. Organic P (Po) was obtained by the \n\ndifference between Pt and Pi, according to Saunders and Williams (1955) modified by Walker and \n\nAdams (1958). Extractable inorganic P (Pi-Olsen) was determined by the Olsen method (Olsen et \n\nal., 1954). Total P Olsen (Pt-Olsen) was assessed by digesting an aliquot of the previous extract \n\nwith 11M H2SO4 and (NH4)2S2O8 (USEPA, 1982). Organic P Olsen (Po-Olsen) was obtained by \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n61 \n\n \n\nthe difference between Pt-Olsen and Pi-Olsen. Soil P intensity (P-CaCl2) was determined according \n\nto Houba et al. (1990), by shaking air dried soil in 0.01M CaCl2 (1:10 soil-solution/30min). P \n\nconcentration in the soil extracts and digestates were determined by the molybdate-ascorbic acid \n\nblue method in a segmented flow analyser (SanPlus, Skalar, Breda, NL) after a dialysis step to \n\nprevent interference from color and solids in suspension (Coutinho, 1996). \n\n3.3.5 - Enzymatic activity \n\nThe potential enzymatic activities of ?-glucosidase and acid phosphatases were quantified \n\naccording to Tabatabai (1994). Briefly, P-nitrophenyl-?-D-glucopyranoside was used as substrate \n\nto determine the ?G activity in a modified universal buffer (pH 6.0) and incubated for 1h at 37\u00baC. \n\nAP activity was determined with p-nitrophenyl-phosphate as substrate in a modified universal \n\nbuffer (pH 6.5) and incubated for 1h at 37\u00baC. In both enzymatic activity determinations, the final \n\np-nitrophenol (p-NP) concentration, as the reaction product, was determined by molecular \n\nabsorption spectrophotometry, at 400nm, in a segmented flow analyser (SanPlus, Skalar, Breda, \n\nNL), and expressed in \u00b5g p-NP g-1h-1. \n\n3.3.6 - Statistical analysis \n\nWeighted means in each profile were calculated taking into consideration the different \n\nthickness of each layer. Statistical analyses (linear and logarithmical regressions, arithmetic and \n\nweighed averages, ranges and Pearson correlation coefficients (r)) were carried out using Analysis \n\nToolPak and Solver supplement of Microsoft Excel\u00ae. The symbols *, ** and *** indicate \n\nsignificance at &lt;0.05, &lt;0.01 and &lt;0.001 probability (p) levels, respectively. Prior to analysis of \n\nthe potentials for nutrient acquisition, exoenzymatic activities were loge transformed to normalize \n\nvariance, according to the conventions of stoichiometric analyses (Sinsabaugh et al., 2012). \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n62 \n\n \n\n3.4 - Results and Discussion \n\n3.4.1 - Soil properties \n\nThe weighted averages of some chemical parameters of the soils under study are shown in \n\nTable 3.1, based on the individual values for each layer already presented in Chapter 2. \n\nTable 3.1 - Chemical properties of the studied soils (weighed means of the five assessed layers). \n\nConcerning OC, soils I and VI had the highest contents, 156 and 178 g OC kg-1, \n\nrespectively. Nevertheless, and despite having the same classification of soils IV and V (Vitric \n\nAndosols), soil VI seems to present a better preservation of its OC fraction, which may be attributed \n\nto the fact that it was never tilled, just as soil I. The no-tillage management of the soils is expected \n\nto be partially responsible for a general  decrease on the OC mineralization fluxes (Reeves, 1997). \n\nNevertheless, and according to Eswaran et al. (1993), soils derived from volcanic materials tend to \n\naccumulate organic matter, as influenced by their andic properties. Inoue and Higashi (1988) \n\nobserved that the accumulation of OC in the upper 35 cm of andic soils have a strong linear \n\nrelationship with extractable Alox and Feox.  \n\n \n\n \n\nParameters \nSoil \n\nI II III IV V VI \n\npH 5.1 5.3 5.5 5.4 5.4 5.4 \n\nOC (g kg-1) 156 147 137 44 62 178 \n\nPo (g kg-1) 2.1 2.0 1.6 0.52 0.83 1.9 \n\nPt (g kg-1) 2.8 2.9 2.2 2.3 3.1 3.1 \n\nPo-Olsen (mg kg-1) 46 35 27 14 10 37 \n\nPi-Olsen (mg kg-1) 23 19 9 65 77 39 \n\nP-CaCl2 (mg kg-1) 0.04 0.01 0.01 0.64 0.98 0.36 \n\nPR % 99 98 99 50 60 59 \n\nAlox (mol kg-1) 1.51 1.63 1.90 0.81 0.96 1.05 \n\nFeox (mol kg-1) 0.20 0.16 0.18 0.08 0.07 0.12 \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n63 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Soil profile distribution of a) organic carbon (OC) and b) organic phosphorus (Po) contents. \n\nIn the present study, a significant trend of OC increase was observed only with ammonium \n\noxalate extractable Feox (r = 0.54**, n = 30) but not with Alox. Kunito et al. (2016) on forest \n\nAndosols, pointed out that reduced availability of SOM, as a result of Al and Fe binding, may \n\nprotect a substantial pool of OC from microbial degradation, leading to suppressed microbial \n\nmediated nutrient cycling. \n\nIn each of the individual soils, the OC contents decreases along the soil profile (Figure 3.1a) \n\nand this stratification may be due to the management of the soils, since they have been used as \n\npermanent grazing grasslands, not being tilled for the past 20 years and thus subjected to topsoil \n\naccumulation of crop residues and faeces deposition. The average content of the soils was of 120 \n\ng OC kg-1 for the whole profile and of 175 g OC kg-1 in the top 0-1 cm layer.  \n\nThe mean value for Pt contents of the studied soils is 2.7 g P kg\n-1, where Po represents about \n\n54.3% of the total, which are in accordance with the range of 30 to 70 % for the Po pool on Pt \n\nreferred by Amano (1981) for Andosols. Nevertheless, the extreme values of 23.0 % and 75.3 %, \n\nobserved in soils IV and I respectively, are outside of the range referred by that author. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n64 \n\n \n\nGudmundsson et al (2014) also found higher rates of Po than Pi at superficial bulk layer of 15 and \n\n20 cm of andic soils from Iceland, after long-term inorganic fertilization of grasslands. Considering \n\nindividual profiles, only soils IV and V presented higher Pi content when compared to Po, the same \n\nsoils where the lowest contents of OC, Alox and Feox were also observed (Table 3.1).  \n\nThe overall Po mean of the six soils was 1.5 g P kg\n-1 in the top 15 cm, decreasing from 2.0 \n\nto 1.3 g Po kg\n-1 in depth. As a component of the SOM, Po is highly correlated with OC (r = 0.91***, \n\nn = 6 and r = 0.96***, n = 30), and represents about 0.72 % of the SOM fraction. Soils I and IV \n\nhad the highest and the lowest contents, 2.1 and 0.55 g P kg-1, respectively. The lower amounts of \n\nPo and their percentages on Pt in Soils IV and V may be due to their vitric character. In Andosols \n\nfrom Japan, Otani and Ae (1999) found that organic forms of P were tightly bound to Al and Fe \n\ncompounds, thus not easily mineralizable by microorganisms, since active Al and Fe may bind \n\nlabile Po in a similar manner to labile Pi. \n\nConsidering that both soils IV and V have lower contents of Alox and Feox, it is expectable \n\nthat the OC, and subsequently Po, also present lower values, as observed in Table 3.1, probably due \n\nto a faster mineralization or due to the relative youngness of the Vitric Andosols with lower amounts \n\nof OC accumulation. \n\nNevertheless, and as previously referred, despite being also a Vitric Andosol, soil VI \n\npresents a better preservation of its OC and Po contents, which may be attributed to the fact that it \n\nwas never tilled, reinforcing the effect of an easier mineralization in soils IV and V. With the \n\nexception of these same soils (IV and V), Po contents decrease along each soil profile (Figure 3.1b). \n\nIn Andosols, Otani and Ae (1999, 1997) also did not observe an accumulation or stratification of \n\nPo, even after the addition of organic matter, but they observed a clear stratification for Pi. Cade-\n\nMenun et al. (2010) observed that labile Pi concentration was significantly higher under no-till than \n\nin tilled soils at 5-10 cm layer after a long-term study comparing conservation tillage and \n\nconventional tillage, but did not observed significant variation in Pt and Po. Rodrigues et al. (2016), \n\nstudying tropical soils under conservative tillage and mineral fertilization, reported a Po built up at \n\nthe surface layers. No-tillage systems led to an accumulation of Po, despite representing less than \n\n20 % of soil Pt and an increase of labile and non-labile Pi fractions were also observed, in particular \n\nin the 0-5 cm soil layers, when compared to conventional tillage. \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n65 \n\n \n\nFinally, Alox + Feox contents presented positive correlations with Po (r = 0.51***, n = 30), \n\nwhich may indicate the protective effect of Al and Fe constituents on P mineralization (Otani and \n\nAe, 1997). As Alox is less correlated with Po (r = 0.48*) than Feox (r = 0.67***), the results may \n\nalso suggest that P organic forms in these type of soils present a higher affinity for Fe than for Al. \n\nRegarding the organic fraction of P extracted by the Olsen method, soils I and V presents \n\nalso the highest and the lowest Po-Olsen contents, respectively 46 and 10 mg P kg\n-1 (Table 3.1). \n\nThe top 2 cm presented an average content of 49 mg P kg-1, about 2.1 times higher than the sub-\n\nsuperficial layers (5 \u2013 15 cm), where the rhizosphere is primarily developed and nutrients are \n\nabsorbed. As observed for Po, soils IV and V do not show a clear decreasing stratification also for \n\nPo-Olsen (data not shown). The overall mean of Po-Olsen represents nearly 1.9 % of the total Po, \n\nalthough with variations among the samples. In fact, Po-Olsen is correlated with both Po (r = 0.95**) \n\nand OC (r = 0.91*) when the weighted means of the six soils are considered, since the accumulation \n\nof OC in the soil leads to the accumulation of Po and subsequently of potentially labile Po-Olsen. \n\nBut when the relationships are searched among the individual values of the 30 samples, two linear \n\nregressions can be established between Po-Olsen and Po or OC. An expected positive slope and a \n\nhigh level of correlation are observed for soils I, II, III and VI, but a negative slope is observed for \n\nsoils IV and V (Figure 3.2). \n\nIn these relationships, Po presents a better correlation (r = 0.90***, n = 20) than OC (r = \n\n0.72***, n = 20) in soils I, II, III and IV. On the opposite, soils IV and V show a negative slope \n\nand weaker correlation for both parameters, significant to OC (r = 0.65*, n = 10) but not significant \n\nto Po. Generally, these results do not fully agree with the data presented by Turner and Haygarth \n\n(2005) for temperate pastures in non-volcanic soils, since the authors did not found any correlation \n\nbetween Po-Olsen and SOM, although Po-Olsen and Po were correlated (r = 0.54**). Soils with \n\ndifferent characteristics after disturbance undergo through changes in the native OC (Cannell and \n\nHawes, 1994) and the same may happen with native Po, with consequences on the Po: Po-Olsen \n\nratio. In the present study, although that ratio does not appear to be dependent on the absolute \n\ncontent of SOM (r = 0.35ns, n = 30), a significant relationship is observed with pH values (r = -\n\n0.63***, n = 30), with the ratio of the labile organic fraction on Po increasing with soil acidity. On \n\nthe other hand, whereas Po-Olsen (NaHCO3) is considered as labile form of organic P and available \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n66 \n\n \n\nP is closely related to these organic P fractions (Tiessen et al., 1984), its specific quantification and \n\nfurther study may contribute to advances in soil test procedures and interpretation. In fact, labile \n\norganic P is undetectable in the molybdate-reactive P in the Olsen extract, but Po-Olsen values, in \n\nsome of our samples, are higher than Pi-Olsen. \n\nFigure 3.2 - Linear regression, with soil IV and V discrimination, of a) organic carbon (OC) versus Olsen extractable \n\norganic phosphorus (Po-Olsen),  b) organic phosphorus (Po) versus extractable organic phosphorus (Po-Olsen). \n\n3.4.2 - Soil enzyme activities \n\nIn our study the weighted means of ?G activity (Table 3.2) vary from 111 (soil III) to 316 \n\n\u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1 (soil V), being generally wither then the 48 and 169 \u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1 reported by \n\nDick et al.

The group of the Vitric Andosols have a higher average ?G \n\nactivity, presenting approximately twice the activity (296 \u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1) when compared to \n\nHaplic and Placic Andosols (143 \u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1). \n\nConcerning the weighted means of AP activity in each soil, values ranged from 1278 (soil \n\nIV) to 1719 \u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1 for AP, again in soil V.

On the other hand, the \n\nobserved values tend to be on the upper limit of the range reported for air-dried soils (Dick et al., \n\n1996) or temperate soils under permanent pasture (Turner and Haygarth, 2005), 1112 and 1694 \u00b5g \n\np-NP g-1 h-1 respectively. In Japanese Andosols, Kunito et al. (2012) also observed high \n\nphosphatase activity, referring that microbial communities in these soils produce large amounts of \n\nphosphatases to ensure an adequate P supply. \n\nIn all the six soils, the 0 \u2013 2 cm layer presented the higher activity rates. The gradient of the \n\n?G and AP potential activities for each soil are shown in Figures 3.3a and 3.3b. Along the soil \n\nprofiles, their gradients show similar trends to those of OC and Po previously referred. Eivazi and \n\nTabatabai (1990), when assessing the factors that affect ?G of the 100 cm superficial layer of \n\nagriculture soils in Iowa, also found a decrease on the potential activity along the soil depth. For \n\nIowa soils, the same observation for AP activity was reported by Juma and Tabatabai (1978). Redel \n\net al. (2008) in a forest andic soil observed higher values of AP activity on the 0-2cm layer (9700 \n\nto 25300 \u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1) than in the remaining layers until 20 cm depth (6000 to 18200 \u00b5g p-NP \n\ng-1 h-1). \u0160najdr et al. (2008) also reported a gradient in the AP and ?G activities along the depth in \n\na forest soil. \n\nAlthough ?G and AP are highly correlated (r = 0.87***, n =30) with each other (Figure \n\n3.4a), there were no correlations with OC or Po when the 30 samples were compared. However, \n\nwhen the linear correlations for the 5 layers of each of the individual soils were considered, \n\nrelationships were much closer, with most of their r values presenting a high or very high level of \n\nsignificance (Figure 3.4b and 3.4c). Eivazi and Tabatabai (1990) and Juma and Tabatabai (1978) \n\nalso found a close relationship between potential soil enzymatic activity and the respective \n\nsubstrate (SOM and Po) in each of the studied soils. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n68 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 - Studied soils (a) ?-glucosidase (?G) and (b) acid phosphatase (AP) activities, in the 15 cm stratified \n\nassessed profile \n\nConcerning the contents of Alox and Feox extracted (Figure 3.5a and 3.5b) inverse \n\ncorrelations of ?G or AP activities were observed, suggesting a repressing effect promoted by these \n\nsoil minerals, as reported by Allison (2006) on Hawaiian Andosols. Moreover, it seems that these \n\nsoils characteristics affect more ?G activity than AP (Figure 3.5a and 3.5b). In fact, both the \n\nrelationship of potential enzymatic activities versus the Alox and Feox content were inverse, but the \n\n?G versus Alox + Feox was better correlated (r = 0.71***, n = 30) than the AP versus Alox + Feox (r \n\n= 0.46*, n = 30). Yan et al. (2010) in silty clay Stagnic Anthrosol, reported that the immobilization \n\nof ?G on inorganic soil colloids may have depressed its free activity untill about 73 %, suggesting \n\nthat the active sites of the enzyme were hindered by the soil colloidal surfaces, resulting in its \n\ninaccessibility for the substrate or in modifications of the active sites. Therefore, the high contents \n\nof organic matter usually reported for Andosols (WRB, 2006) may be also related with the reduced \n\n?G activity due to the high contents of Al and Fe of these soils. In fact, the higher slopes presented \n\nby both soils IV and V (Vitric Andosols) for the relationship between ?G and OC, about 6 times \n\nhigher than for other soils (Figure 3.4b), suggest a higher substrate availability in the former soils, \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n69 \n\n \n\nwhich also present lower OC contents as a possible consequence of their lower richness in \n\nextractable Alox and Feox (Table 3.1) \n\nFigure 3.4 - Linear regression representation of: (a) acid phosphatase (AP) versus ?-glucosidase (?G); (b) ?-\n\nglucosidase (?G) activity versus organic carbon (OC) content; and (c) acid phosphatase (AP) versus organic \n\nphosphorus (Po) of the six studied soils. \n\n0\n\n300\n\n600\n\n900\n\n1200\n\n1500\n\n0 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\n?\nG\n\n (\n\u00b5\n\ng\n p\n\n-N\nP\n\n g\n-1\n\nh\n-1\n\n)\n\nOC ( g kg-1)\n\nb )\nsoil I (r = 0.95**)\n\nsoil II (r = 0.72 ns)\n\nsoil III (r = 0.93**)\n\nsoil IV (r = 0.97**)\n\nsoil V (r = 0.99***)\n\nsoil VI (r = 0.66 ns)\n\ny = 3.1294x + 975.08\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.7556\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500\n\nA\nP\n\n (\n\u00b5\n\ng\n p\n\n-N\nP\n\n g\n-1\n\nh\n-1\n\n)\n\n?G (\u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1)\n\na )\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\n\nA\nP\n\n (\n\u00b5\n\ng\n p\n\n-N\nP\n\n g\n-1\n\nh\n-1\n\n)\n\nPo (g kg\n-1)\n\nc )\n\nsoil I (r = 0.93, **)\n\nsoil II (r = 0.71 ns)\n\nsoil III (r = 0.98***)\n\nsoil IV (r = 0.88**)\n\nsoil V (r = 0.62 ns)\n\nsoil VI (r = 0.96***)\n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n70 \n\n \n\nMoreover, both enzymes seem to be more affected by Al than by Fe. ?G activity presented \n\na r = -0.65*** for Alox and r = -0.59** (n = 30) for Feox, while AP activity presented a r = -0.42* \n\nwith Alox and no significant correlation with Feox (n = 30). Eivazi and Tabatabai (1990), when \n\nevaluating the effect of metals in the ?G activity, found that Al and Fe could inhibit its activity up \n\nto 45 and 32 %, respectively. Rao and Gianfreda (2000) and Rao et al.

(2016), lowering its availability for mineralization; (ii) or by the inhibition of ?-\n\nglucosidase activity by Al and Fe, lowering the mineralization efficiency by microbes.

As shown in Figure 3.6, a positive linear regression of AP against \n\nPi is observed (r = 0.57**, n = 30) when all the 30 samples are considered. When the regression is \n\nestablished with the weighted averages of the 6 soils, no relationship is observed (r = 0.06ns).  \n\nFigure 3.6 - Linear regression of acid phosphatase (AP) versus inorganic P (Pi) for all samples (n = 30) and for the \n\nweighted average of each soil (n = 6). \n\nThese results contradict the reported inhibition of AP by the presence of phosphate anion \n\n(Dick et al., 2011) and the observations of Juma and Tabatabai (1978), authors who reported an \n\ninhibition effect of soil phosphatases activity due to the presence of soil applied P. This apparent \n\ncontradiction may be explained by the fact that the observations made by Juma and Tabatabai \n\n(1978) were done within the same soil, while the present results respect to 6 six different soils and \n\n30 different samples. On the other hand, the soil characteristics of both studies are substantially \n\ndifferent. Borie and Zunino (1983) have already reported that AP activities are usually very high \n\nin andic soils due to: (i) protective effect of Al and Fe compounds on AP and; (ii) the low P intensity \n\nin soil solution, even when they are fertilized, which is related with the high P retention capacity \n\nof these soils. \n\nTherefore, different P retention capacities of soils may overlap the inhibition of AP activity \n\npromoted by Pi, since applied Pi in andic soils can be readily fixed by Al and Fe compounds, thereby \n\nreducing its availability in soil solution. Once more, the lower slopes presented by Haplic and \n\nPlacic Andosols for the relationship between AP and Po, of about 7 times less than for Vitric \n\nAndosols (Figure 3.4c), suggest again a lower substrate availability (Po) in the former soils, as a \n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\n6000\n\n0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50\n\nA\nP\n\n (\n\u00b5\n\ng\n p\n\n-N\nP\n\n g\n-1\n\nh\n-1\n\n)\n\nPi (g kg\n-1)\n\nn = 30, r = 0.57**\n\nn = 6, r = 0.06 ns\n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n72 \n\n \n\npossible consequence of their higher content in extractable Alox and Feox (Table 3.1). Otani and Ae \n\n(1997) reported that labile Po in andic soils can be also fixed by Al and Fe in a similar manner to \n\nlabile Pi. \n\n3.4.3 - P acquisition effort \n\nNutrient availability in soil can be expressed by calculating the acquisition effort by \n\nmicrobial extracellular enzymatic activity. The ratio of P to C enzyme activities (AP: ?G), the so-\n\ncalled P acquisition effort, translates the energy allocation made by microorganisms to acquire P \n\nthrough extracellular enzymes (Moro et al., 2015), providing information about the soil nutrient \n\navailability (Sinsabaugh and Shah, 2012). Haplic and Placic Andosols have higher ratio, weighted \n\naverage of 12, than Vitric Andosols, 5.6, showing nearly twice the effort (Table 3.2), and both \n\nvalues are much higher than those indicated by Sinsabaugh et al. (2010) in soils that span 40 \n\necosystems from the river Mississipy, Misouri, Ohio and the Great Lakes (an average of 1.6). \n\nNevertheless, Moro et al. (2015) assessed values with the same magnitude for soils derived from \n\nvolcanic materials. The AP: ?G ratio presents a high inverse correlation with Pi, Pi-Olsen and P-\n\nCaCl2 (r = -0.76***, -0.78*** and -0.71***, n = 30), Figure 3.7a, 3.7b and 3.7c, in accordance \n\nwith the results presented by Moro et al. (2015) when relating the AP:?G ratio versus soil Pi-Olsen. \n\nBut a high positive correlation is observed with active Alox + Feox contents (r = 0.85***, n = 30), \n\nFigure 3.7d. \n\nThese results suggest that the effort for the acquisition of P, through the allocation of energy \n\nto produce AP enzymes, decreases when available P exists at levels able to supply microorganism \n\nand plants homeostasis and full development needs. So, when Al and Fe are present at higher levels \n\n(Haplic and Placic Andosols), high values of AP: ?G ratio are expected since P retention is higher, \n\nresulting in low Pi availability, leading to a more intense production and exudation of AP to \n\nmineralize soil Po. In Japanese acidic Andosols, Kunito et al. (2012) have already lead to equivalent \n\nconclusions, observing that the high phosphatase activity is due to low P availability. In these soils, \n\nmicrobial communities produce large amounts of phosphatase to ensure an adequate P supply, \n\nresulting in an increase of activity in P-limited soils. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n73 \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 - Weighted average ratio of different assessed soil parameter. \n\na microbial effort for enzyme production/exudation; b potential activity of C and P acquisition; c potential activity of \n\nC:P acquisition. \n\nRelating soil AP: ?G ratio with plant P availability and uptake, Moro et al. (2015) reported \n\nvalues between 3.9 and 9.5 for cabbage field plots subjected to P fertilization. Their results indicate \n\nthe potential usefulness of this index also for agronomic purposes, since the higher values of AP: \n\n?G were observed on plots where no P was applied, where the crop also presented the lower yield \n\nand the lower P contents in the aerial biomass. \n\nBased on the same principles, another approach has been proposed by Sinsabaugh and \n\nMoorhead (1994) and Sinsabaugh and Shah (2012), using the concepts of potential activity for C \n\nacquisition and for P acquisition, ln(?G) and ln(AP), respectively, and defining the potential of C:P \n\nacquisition as the  ln(?G):ln(AP) ratio. This potential of C:P acquisition measures the different \n\nenergy resource partition between organic P acquisition and growth (Sinsabaugh et al., 2008). \n\nAs expected from AP and ?G relationship (Figure 5a), ln(?G) versus ln(AP), are highly \n\ncorrelated (r = 0.90***, n = 30). Studying nutrient acquisition in soils and sediments, Sinsabaugh \n\net al. (2010) indicated a slope of 1.16. Waring et al. (2014) performed a meta-analysis to explore \n\nenergetic and stoichiometric constraints on enzyme production in tropical soils with low P \n\nbioavailability. These authors also found a high linear correlation (r = 0.80***, n = 57) between \n\npotential C acquisition and potential P acquisition, with a slope of 1.18. The higher value achieved \n\nin our study, 1.40, is consistent with the low bioavailability P in soils derived from volcanic \n\nmaterials (Sinsabaugh et al., 2012). \n\n \nSoil \n\nI II III IV V VI \n\nC:P 142 132 160 50 52 149 \n\n?G (\u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1) 171 148 111 303 316 270 \n\nAP (\u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1) 1650 1592 1443 1278 1719 1551 \n\nAP : ?G a 10.7 10.7 14.7 4.6 5.8 6.4 \n\nln(?G) (nmol p-NP g-1 OC) b 8.9 8.8 8.6 10.4 10.2 9.1 \n\nln(AP) (nmol p-NP g-1 OC) b 11.2 11.2 11.2 11.9 11.9 11.0 \n\nln(?G) : ln(AP) c 0.79 0.79 0.76 0.87 0.85 0.83 \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 - Logaritnmical (ln) regression of  acid phosphatase (AP) to ?-glucosidase (?G) ratio (P acquisition effort) \n\nagainst: a) inorganic P (Pi); b) extractable inorganic P (Pi-Olsen); c) soil solution inorganic P (P-CaCl2); and d) linear \n\nregression of  acid phosphatase (AP) to ?-glucosidase (?G) ratio versus Alox + Feox content. \n\nConcerning the potential of C:P acquisition (ln(?G):ln(AP)), its value is expected to be \n\nhigher when lesser energy effort is directed to P acquisition (AP: ?G), being both indices highly \n\ncorrelated (r = -0.93***, n = 30) in our soils. Therefore, the potential of C:P acquisition is positively \n\naffected by the inorganic P pools and negatively affected by Alox and Feox contents, in accordance \n\nwith Allison (2006) and Sinsabaugh and Shah (2012) and the present results referred previously \n\n(Figure 3.7). In the case of the regression with Alox + Feox, the relationship is much closer (Figure \n\n3.8, r = 0.90***, n = 30) than with AP: ?G (Figure 3.7d). Considering that active Al and Fe bond \n\nto SOM (Dahlgren et al., 2004), repressing the activity of AP (Kunito et al., 2016), the results \n\nsuggest that active Al and Fe are involved in the decreasing of the potential C:P acquisition activity \n\n(r = -0.86***, n = 30) on these soils. \n\n  \n\ny = -2.642ln(x) + 17.068\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.6011\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n\nA\nP\n\n:?\nG\n\nPi-Olsen (mg kg\n-1)\n\nb)\n\ny = -5.228ln(x) + 8.9751\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.571\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0\n\nA\nP\n\n:?\nG\n\nPi (g kg\n-1)\n\na)\n\ny = -0.61ln(x) + 5.5205\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.5094\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0\n\nA\nP\n\n:?\nG\n\nP-CaCl2 ( mg kg\n-1)\n\nc)\n\ny = 0.007x - 1.5981\n\nR\u00b2 = 0.7235\n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000\n\nA\nP\n\n:?\nG\n\nAlox + Feox (mmol kg\n-1)\n\nd)\n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n75 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 - Linear regression of potential of C:P acquisition (ln(?G):ln(AP)) versus Alox + Feox extractable content, n \n\n= 30; in dashed line the threshold for energy shift for P acquisition. \n\n Sinsabaugh et al., 2010 also indicated the average of 0.95 for soils (n = 929) as the threshold \n\nvalue below which the energy resource allocation shifts towards organic P acquisition over growth \n\nutilization. In the present study, all the observed values are much lower (Figure 3.8), either for the \n\nweighed mean of the Haplic and Placic Andosols (0.66) and Vitric Andosols 0.75 ratio (Table 3.2), \n\nas for each individual layer (between 0.74 and 0.91). Therefore, these lower ratios indicate, once \n\nmore, the low mineral P bioavailability of these soils, which leads to an intense AP production and \n\ntends to shift the energy partition from growth towards P acquisition and homeostasis maintenance, \n\nespecially on the Haplic and Placic Andosols, with higher levels of extractable Alox and Feox. Thus, \n\nthe limitation on the size of the soil microbial biomass through the energy restriction for microbial \n\ngrowth may also contribute for the OC accumulation in these soils. \n\nCleveland and Liptzin (2007) pointed out an average value of 186 (166 for pasture soils) \n\nfor the molar C:P ratio and Sinsabaugh et al. (2010) considering this value as the threshold value \n\nabove which  a P limitation may occur. In our work, it was observed that Vitric Andosols show a \n\nvalue of 84 for the molar C:P ratio, lower than the average value (145) observed for the Haplic and \n\nPlacic Andosols (Table 3.2). Vitric Andosols show lower P acquisition effort, when compared to \n\nHaplic and Placic Andosols that have higher Al and Fe contents, being related to the observed \n\nlower C:P ratio in Vitric Andosols (Table 3.2). Therefore, it seems that the average C:P ratio of \n\n186, pointed by those authors, as a general threshold value, needs to be adjusted for soils derived \n\nfrom volcanic materials.

Only for Po \n\nit was found a significant linear and positive correlation with both Alox and Feox; \n\n- Activitiy of soil ?G is repressed by both Alox and Feox, being the effect of Alox much closer \n\nrelated to enzyme activity than that of Feox; \n\n- Activity of soil AP seems to be only affected by Alox, since no significant relationship was \n\nobserved with extractable Feox; \n\n- The effort for P acquisition (AP: ?G activity ratio) and the potential of C:P acquisition \n\n(ln(?G):ln(AP)) are both affected by the Pi pools and by Al and Fe contents. Therefore, for \n\nthe maintenance of the homeostasis condition, the energy allocation to produce AP enzymes \n\ndecreases when available Pi exist at levels able to supply growth requirements. On the \n\ncontrary, when Al and Fe minerals are abundant and Pi retention is high, the energy \n\nallocation shifts to the production of AP enzymes to mineralize soil Po and affecting the \n\nmicrobe growth rate; \n\n- The presence of abundant and crescent inorganic phosphate itself is not a condition for the \n\ninhibition of soil AP activity, since its activity in different soils also depends on their \n\ncapacity for P retention; \n\n- The inhibition effect of inorganic phosphate on the soil AP activity is also dependent on the \n\nsoil P retention capacity; \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n78 \n\n \n\n- All the referred effects of active Al and Fe on (i) the accumulation of OC and Po, (ii) the \n\nrepression on BG and AP activities, (iii) the increase on the resource allocation on P \n\nacquisition, are more evident on Haplic and Placic Andosols due to their higher content on \n\nthose minerals, than in the Vitric Andosols; \n\n- the general C:P molar ratio threshold value for energy resource partition between growth \n\nand P acquisition probably needs to be adjusted for soils derived from volcanic materials. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 3 - Acid phosphatase and ?-glucosidase activities in fertilized pastures over soils derived from volcanic material:  \n\ndistribution profile and P acquisition effort \n\n79 \n\n \n\n3.6 - References \n\nAlef, K. and Nannipieri, P., 1995.

In this island, about 40 % of the land is used for pasture proposes, and \n\nsuperficial P fertilization without incorporation is the main practice, even in situations with steep \n\nslopes. Simultaneously, the high P retention capacity is one of the characteristic of volcanic \n\nmaterials derived soils, due to their richness in active Al and Fe, which reduces P availability for \n\nplant uptake. The observed Al and Fe richness seems to be also involved in the high OC content \n\naccumulated in the superficial layers of these soils, through repressing microbial and enzyme \n\nactivity and/or protecting organic matter from mineralization. \n\nRegarding the P vertical distribution in these soils altered by fertilized pastures, it was \n\nobserved a stratified gradient along the profile for the different P pools, consequence both of the \n\nsuperficial application of fertilizers without incorporation into the soil, and their high adsorption \n\ncapacity. Haplic and Placic Andosols, richer in extractable Alox and Feox contents presented lower \n\nPi contribution to their Pt, when compared to Vitric Andosols. \n\nDespite the high P content assessed by the Olsen soil P test, ammonium lactate and CaCl2, \n\nwhich were above the agronomical threshold limits, they still present values below the \n\nenvironmental threshold values estimated either by the desorbed P in 0.01M CaCl2 suspensions or \n\nby their degree of phosphorus saturation (DPS). In fact, the DPS of the six soils under study \n\npresented values ranging from 5.1 to 15.2 %, below the more conservative limit of 25 %. Vitric \n\nAndosols presented higher DPS values when compared to the remaining soils classes, which seems \n\nto be related with their lower Alox and Feox contents. Due to their low ability to desorb P, the \n\nobtained results suggest that soils may not represent themselves a risk of P losses into to \n\nfreshwaters. Therefore, it needs to be considered the hypothesis of a direct runoff of the \n\nsuperficially applied fertilizers before dissolution, particularly rainfall events in the steepest slope \n\npastures. If true, the fertilizer application with deep-banding systems in longer periods of time may \n\nbe a solution, as an alternative to the interdiction of the use of fertilizers on the most sensitive and \n\nhilly areas of the watersheds. \n\nA decrease of organic carbon (OC) contents was observed along the profile, in all soils \n\nunder study, as a result of the superficial accumulation of crop residues and faeces deposition, since \n\n\n\nChapter 4 - General Conclusions \n\n \n\n86 \n\n \n\nthey were used for grazed grassland and they were not tilled for the past 20 years. Active Alox and \n\nFeox are positively related with OC, which may be interpreted as a protective role of those \n\ncompounds over a substantial pool of the OC, decreasing the rate of its mineralization. Po represents \n\nabout 54 % of the soils P content, and since labile Po forms may be tightly bound to Al and Fe \n\ncompounds, in a similar manner to Pi, it may be also protected from mineralization by \n\nmicroorganisms. Vitric Andosols showed lower OC accumulation, due to their youth or a faster \n\nmineralization, as they have lower Al and Fe contents. Since soils with different characteristics \n\nafter disturbance undergo through changes in the native OC, a segregation of soils was observed \n\nbetween labile Po and Po or OC. Labile Po, extracted by Olsen methodology,  represents about 1.9 \n\n% of the total Po, and its content was higher than Pi-Olsen in 53 % of the soil samples. Therefore, \n\nfurther studies concerning Po-Olsen may contribute to advances in soil test procedures and \n\ninterpretation, when assessing potential plant available P. \n\nRegarding the ?-glucosidase (?G) and acid phosphatase (AP) enzyme activities, it was \n\nobserved that the 0-2cm up layers show always the higher rates, 562 and 2938 \u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1, \n\nrespectively. Similar to OC and Po, both enzymes presented a gradient along the studied profile \n\ndepth. Vitric Andosols presented a higher average ?G activity, approximately twice the activity \n\n(296 \u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1) when compared to Haplic and Placic Andosols (143 \u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1). Activity \n\nof AP ranged between 1278 and 1719 \u00b5g p-NP g-1 h-1, being their average rates for both soil groups \n\nmore similar than for ?G activity. Both activities were highly correlated to each other, and also \n\nbetween ?G versus OC and AP versus Po.  \n\nNegative correlations of ?G or AP activity with extractable Alox or Feox were obtained, \n\nsuggesting a repression effect promoted by these compounds, being this effect more pronounced \n\nwith active Al than with Fe. On the other hand, and being the soils subjected to periodic mineral P \n\nfertilization, it was not observed an inhibition of AP activity due to the accumulation of P on the \n\ndifferent pools. Soil P concentration regulates the AP production and release from cells by genetic \n\nexpression through Pi signal transduction pathway, according to environmental signals, that is the \n\nabundance of exogenous and endogenous P pools. Therefore, an explanation may be related to the \n\nhigh P retention capacity of Andosols, which seems to overlap the inhibition of AP activity \n\nexpected from the abundance of Pi. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 - General Conclusions \n\n \n\n87 \n\n \n\nConcerning the P acquisition effort by microbial population, Haplic and Placic Andosols \n\nhave an higher ratio of P to C enzyme activities (AP:?G) than Vitric Andosols. Consequently, the \n\nP acquisition effort made by microbes seems to be higher on the former groups of soils. In contrast \n\nto what was reported for AP activity itself, it was observed a significant and negative correlation \n\namong AP:?G and the different with Pi pools, especially in the case of labile Pi-Olsen content (r = \n\n0.78***, n = 30), and a significant and positive correlation with active Alox+Feox. Therefore, the \n\nresults corroborate that the effort for P acquisition, through energy allocation to produce AP \n\nenzymes, only decreases when available P exists at levels able to ensure microorganism \n\nhomeostasis condition and full development needs. On the opposite, the higher Alox and Feox \n\ncontents are (Haplic and Placic Andosols), the higher AP:?G ratio is expected, since P retention \n\nleads to a low Pi availability, resulting in a more intense production and exudation of AP to \n\nmineralize soil Po.  \n\nA significant correlation was observed between potential C acquisition (ln(?G)) and \n\npotential P acquisition (ln(AP)), and its high value (1.40) of the b constant (slope) is consistent \n\nwith the low P bioavailability in soils derived from volcanic materials. Once more, the results \n\nobtained suggest that active Al and Fe are involved in the decreasing of the potential C:P \n\nacquisition (ln(?G): ln(AP)), since this potential of C:P acquisition is positively affected by the Pi \n\npools and negatively affected by Alox+Feox. \n\nConcerning the potential C:P acquisition (ln(?G): ln(AP)), all the obtained values were \n\nbelow the referred threshold value indicated in the bibliography (0.95), below which the energy \n\nresource allocation shifts towards organic P acquisition over growth use. Once more, the obtained \n\nresults suggest that active Al and Fe are involved in the decreasing of the potential C:P acquisition, \n\nsince this potential is positively affected by the Pi pools and negatively affected by Alox+Feox. \n\nConsequently, lower values of the potential C:P acquisition were observed on the Haplic and Placic \n\nAndosols, consistent with its lower mineral P bioavailability, which led to an intense AP production \n\nand to a shift of energy partition from growth towards P acquisition and homeostasis maintenance. \n\nTherefore, the limitation on the size of the soil microbial biomass through the energy restriction \n\nfor microbial growth may also contribute for the OC accumulation in these soils. \n\n\n\nChapter 4 - General Conclusions \n\n \n\n88 \n\n \n\nIn accordance to their Alox and Feox contents, Vitric Andosols show a lower P acquisition \n\neffort when compared to Haplic and Placic Andosols. However, both groups present a lower molar \n\nC:P ratio than the general threshold value of 186 pointed out by several authors, above which soils \n\npresent P limitations. Therefore, the present results also seem to indicate the need of a different \n\ncritical value more adjusted for soils derived from volcanic materials. \n\nLastly, the results do not elucidate if OC accumulation is favored (i) by the protection of \n\nSOM by the Al and Fe compounds, lowering its availability for mineralization or; (ii) by the \n\nrepression of ?G activity by the same compounds, lowering the mineralization efficiency by \n\nmicrobes or (iii) by the limitation of energy to microbial growth, reducing the size of the soil \n\nmicrobial biomass compartment. However, it seems to be clear, in all the three hypotheses, the \n\ndeterminant role of Al and Fe compounds on OC accumulation on the soils derived from volcanic \n\nmaterial."}]}}}
