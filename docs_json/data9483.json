The classical approach for solving the interval \n\ntransition probabilities of SMP consists of directly applying any general quadrature method to \n\nthe integral equations. However, this approach has a considerable computational effort. \n\nNamely N2 coupled integral equations must be solved, where N is the number of states. \n\nTherefore, this thesis proposes more efficient mathematical and numerical treatments for \n\nSMP. The first approach, which is called 2N-method, is based on transition frequency \n\ndensities and general quadrature methods. Basically, it consists of only solving N coupled \n\nintegral equations and N straightforward integrations. Another proposed method, named Lap-\n\nmethod, is based on the application of Laplace transforms that are inverted by the Gauss \n\nquadrature method known as Gauss Legendre to obtain the state probabilities on the time \n\ndomain. Mathematical formulation of these approaches as well as descriptions of their \n\nnumerical treatment, including accurateness and time convergence issues, are developed and \n\nprovided with details. The effectiveness of the novel 2N- and Lap-developments will be \n\ncompared against the results provided by the classical method by using examples in the \n\ncontext of reliability engineering. From these examples, it is showed that the 2N- and the \n\nLaplace-based approach are significantly less time-consuming and have accuracy comparable \n\nto the classical method. \n\nKeywords: Semi-Markov Process; Transition Frequency Densities; Quadrature \n\nMethods; Laplace Transforms; Gauss Quadrature; Reliability; Availability Assessment. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n v\n\nRESUMO \n\nProcessos semi-Markovianos (SMP) cont\u00ednuos no tempo s\u00e3o importantes ferramentas \n\nestoc\u00e1sticas para modelagem de m\u00e9tricas de confiabilidade ao longo do tempo para sistemas \n\npara os quais o comportamento futuro depende dos estados presente e seguinte assim como do \n\ntempo de resid\u00eancia. O m\u00e9todo cl\u00e1ssico para resolver as probabilidades intervalares de \n\ntransi\u00e7\u00e3o de SMP consiste em aplicar diretamente um m\u00e9todo geral de quadratura \u00e0s equa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nintegrais. Entretanto, esta t\u00e9cnica possui um esfor\u00e7o computacional consider\u00e1vel, isto \u00e9, N2 \n\nequa\u00e7\u00f5es integrais conjugadas devem ser resolvidas, onde N \u00e9 o n\u00famero de estados. Portanto, \n\nesta tese prop\u00f5e tratamentos matem\u00e1ticos e num\u00e9ricos mais eficientes para SMP. O primeiro \n\nm\u00e9todo, o qual \u00e9 denominado 2N-, \u00e9 baseado em densidades de frequ\u00eancia de transi\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nm\u00e9todos gerais de quadratura. Basicamente, o m\u00e9todo 2N consiste em resolver N equa\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nintegrais conjugadas e N integrais diretas. Outro m\u00e9todo proposto, chamado Lap-, \u00e9 baseado \n\nna aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de transformadas de Laplace as quais s\u00e3o invertidas por um m\u00e9todo de \n\nquadratura Gaussiana, chamado Gauss Legendre, para obter as probabilidades de estado no \n\ndom\u00ednio do tempo. Formula\u00e7\u00e3o matem\u00e1tica destes m\u00e9todos assim como descri\u00e7\u00f5es de seus \n\ntratamentos num\u00e9ricos, incluindo quest\u00f5es de exatid\u00e3o e tempo para converg\u00eancia, s\u00e3o \n\ndesenvolvidas e fornecidas com detalhes. A efetividade dos novos desenvolvimentos 2N- e \n\nLap- ser\u00e3o comparados contra os resultados fornecidos pelo m\u00e9todo cl\u00e1ssico por meio de \n\nexemplos no contexto de engenharia de confiabilidade. A partir destes exemplos, \u00e9 mostrado \n\nque os m\u00e9todos 2N- e Lap- s\u00e3o significantemente menos custosos e t\u00eam acur\u00e1cia compar\u00e1vel \n\nao m\u00e9todo cl\u00e1ssico.

                                                                                                  Introduction \n\n 1\n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\n1.1 Overview \n\nA homogeneous semi-Markov process (HSMP) can be understood as a probabilistic model \n\nwhose future behavior is dependent on sojourn times which are random variables dependent \n\non the current state i and on the state j to which the process will transit next. According to \n\nOuhbi and Limnios (2003), HSMP are more flexible models than ordinary Markov processes \n\nas it is no longer required to assume that sojourn times are exponentially distributed. \n\nRecent applications and theoretical developments on HSMP have been proposed in the \n\ncontext of reliability engineering. For example, Perman et al. (1997) apply a recursive \n\nprocedure to approximate the interval transition probabilities, which are used to assess the \n\nfuture behavior of an HSMP over time. Limnios (1997) proposes a dependability analysis for \n\nHSMP in discrete time by using a method based on algebraic calculus. Ouhbi and Limnios \n\n(1997) estimate reliability and availability through HSMP of a turbo-generator rotor using a \n\nset of real data. Ouhbi and Limnios (2002) propose a statistical formula for assessing the rate \n\nof occurrence of failures (ROCOF) of HSMP. Through this result, ROCOF of the Markov and \n\nalternated renewal processes are given as special cases. Some other applications of HSMP \n\nmay be encountered in related literature, mainly in the reliability field (as exemplified in \n\nJanssen and Manca (2007); Limnios and Oprisan (2001); Pievatolo and Valad\u00e8 (2003)). \n\nThe future behavior of an HSMP is assessed through its interval transition probability \n\nequations which are comprised of a set of N2 coupled convolution integral equations, where N \n\nis the number of states. The classical method for solving these equations is explained in \n\nCorradi et al. (2004), and consists of directly applying a general quadrature method to these \n\nN2 coupled convolution integral equations. However, such an approach is quite burdensome \n\nwith a computational cost sometimes greater than the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. \n\nIn a non-homogeneous semi-Markov process (NHSMP), transitions between two states in \n\nturn may depend not only on such states and on the sojourn times (x), but also on both times \n\nof the last (?) and next (t) transitions, with x = t - ?. The time variable ? is also known as the \n\nmost recent arrival time or last entry time, and the time variable t is the calendar or process \n\ntime. Thus, NHSMP extend other stochastic processes such as HSMP. As a result, NHSMP \n\nare powerful modeling tools, mainly in the context of reliability engineering (as exemplified \n\nin Janssen and Manca (2007)). \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 2\n\nIn spite of that, there are two main reasons to explain the scarcity of NHSMP applications: \n\n(i) Janssen and Manca (2001) argue the non-homogeneity on the continuous time semi-\n\nMarkov environment implies additional difficulties in treating NHSMP; (ii) in accordance \n\nwith Nelson and Wang (2007), for practical applications, gathering of high level required data \n\n(transition probabilities and/or rates) is likely to be a significant challenge, mainly in the \n\npresence of censoring implied by preventive maintenance. \n\nSpecifically regarding the first claim, it gives rise to more intricate mathematical methods \n\nand numerical solutions. Indeed, as it will be discussed in upcoming sections, the future \n\nbehavior of an NHSMP is assessed through its interval transition probability equations which \n\nare comprised of a system of N2 coupled integral equations with two variables, where N is the \n\nnumber of states. The classical method to solve the non-homogeneous equations is explained \n\nin Janssen and Manca (2001), and also consists of directly applying a general quadrature \n\nmethod to these N2 coupled integral equations, as for HSMP. However, such an approach is \n\nmore complex than in the case of homogeneous counterpart, because the integrals involved \n\nare not of convolution type anymore, and also, since the interval transition probabilities to be \n\ndetermined depend on two parameters. \n\nAs it can be seen from this overview on homogeneous and non-homogeneous semi-\n\nMarkov processes, the dynamic behavior analysis of both these models requires solving a set \n\nof N2 integral equations which increase considerably the computational time and intricacy of \n\nthe related solution. Therefore, this thesis proposes alternative methods for solving the \n\nprobability equations of HSMP and NHSMP in continuous time as an attempt to reduce the \n\ncomplexity associated with these stochastic models and to foster their applicability, mainly of \n\nNHSMP. \n\nBasically, one of these approaches consists of casting the N2 coupled integral equations of \n\neither HSMP or NHSMP into an initial value problem involving transition frequency \n\ndensities, and then solve N coupled integral equations with one variable and N straightforward \n\nintegrations. As it will be seen in upcoming chapters, this approach considerably reduces the \n\ncomputational effort in relation to the abovementioned classical method and MC simulation \n\nsince it is not needed solving N2 integral equations anymore. \n\nThis proposed approach is partly based on the work of Becker et al. (2000) where it is \n\npresented the mathematical formulation for semi-Markov processes (SMP) described by \n\ntransition rates ?ij( ? ). Similarly to Becker et al. (2000), the proposed approach also involves \n\ntransition frequency densities. However, from this point the method discussed throughout this \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 3\n\nthesis departs from the one presented in Becker et al. (2000). Firstly, in the proposed method \n\nthe HSMP and NHSMP may be specified in terms of not only transition rates ?ij( ? ), but also \n\nthrough transition probabilities Cij( ? ). SMP described via transition probabilities represent \n\nimportant modeling tools, mainly in reliability applications such as in Janssen and Limnios \n\n(1999) and Droguett et al. (2007). Thus, this thesis proposes an extension to the work \n\ndeveloped in Becker et al. (2000) so that SMP described through both ?ij( ? ) and Cij( ? ) may be \n\nhandled in a more efficient and integrated form. \n\nSecondly, and conversely to Becker et al. (2000), this thesis is also numerical-based, i.e., a \n\nnumerical treatment for the proposed mathematical formulation will be discussed. This \n\nnumerical solution is based on general quadrature methods and will have its effectiveness \n\ncompared against the classical method and the MC simulation by means of some examples in \n\nthe reliability context.  \n\nThus, the proposed approach is two-fold, i.e., it addresses mathematical and numerical \n\nissues related for solving SMP in continuous time. For the sake of simplicity, henceforth the \n\nclassical and proposed approaches will be distinguished through their computational efforts as \n\nN2-method and 2N-method, respectively. \n\nAnother method which will be proposed here to handle specifically the behavior of HSMP \n\nis based on the Laplace Transform (LT) apparatus. The use of LT is not novel on problems \n\ninvolving HSMP. There are some works treating this issue in the related literature (Perman et \n\nal. (1997); Janssen and Manca (2006); Moura (2006); Howard (2007)). Through these \n\napproaches, LT are applied to the N2 coupled convolution integral equations and thus the \n\nsolution on time domain is obtained through respective inversion. However, as stated by \n\nBellman and Roth (1984) (pp. 149), \u201cWe cannot expect that any specific method for the \n\ninversion of the LT will work equally well in all cases\u201d. Moreover, Csenki (1994) (p.233-234) \n\nargues that \u201cno single method can be devised which will perform numerical LT inversion to a \n\ngiven accuracy\u201d. In other words, a unique numerical method to invert LT is not able to solve \n\nany problem in a general way. \n\nIn spite of these statements a method of LT inversion, which was developed by Bellman et \n\nal. (1966), has been applied by Oliveira et al. (2005) for solving the partial differential \n\nequations for non-homogeneous Markov processes described using supplementary variables. \n\nGreat results attained on this situation (for distribution functions widely used in reliability \n\ncontext, like Exponential and Weibull) have led to delve on the feasibility of application of \n\nthat LT method for solving SMP as well, for which the dynamic behavior rise from a \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 4\n\ngeneralization of the Kolmogorov backward differential equations of the Markov environment \n\n(see Feller (1964)). \n\nTherefore, besides the 2N- and N2- approaches, there will also be described a method based \n\non LT for solving SMP. This approach will be drawn only for HSMP (due to reasons that will \n\ncome up over the text) and at the best of our knowledge, as 2N-approach, it has not been used \n\nelsewhere within the semi-Markov environment.  \n\nThis approach, which will be named Lap-method, will also be developed so that it can \n\nhandle HSMP described through either transition probabilities or transition rates. The \n\neffectiveness of the Lap-numerical procedure will be compared against the 2N- and N2-\n\nmethods and the MC simulation in terms of computational effort (time) and accuracy by \n\nmeans of some examples in the context of reliability engineering. \n\nTherefore, the main question behind this thesis is: \u201cHow to solve (homogeneous and non-\n\nhomogeneous) semi-Markov processes through a less intricate and more efficient way?\u201d. \n\n1.2 Motivation and Justifications \n\nIn this section, the main contributions and justifications, under which the present thesis is \n\nbacked up, will be discussed. Basically, two examples that may be faced by reliability \n\npractitioners are presented in order to show which type of practical problems will be solved by \n\nthe proposed mathematical and numerical approaches. \n\nThe first example addresses a case where an HSMP described by transition rates is used to \n\nhandle a repairable pumping oil unit that pumps oil to a storage tank. Then it is discussed \n\nanother example which consists of an NHSMP described by transition probabilities used to \n\nmodel a repairable pressure-temperature optical monitoring system for oil wells.  \n\nBasically, these examples will be treated by the proposed mathematical and numerical \n\napproaches which will be designed in upcoming chapters as an attempt to answer the \n\naforementioned question. \n\n1.2.1 Example 1: Pumping Oil Unit \n\nMost probabilistic models for system availability, reliability and maintainability \n\nassessment assume that the failure of one component immediately causes system failure. In \n\nsome systems, however, the failure of a component leads to a system failure only when repair \n\ntime has exceeded some time T, known as tolerable downtime (TDT). According to Vaurio \n\n(1997), systems that have this feature are known as fault tolerant systems (FTS). \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 5\n\nThis concept is usually employed in the context of software-based systems reliability, for \n\nexample, in Madan et al. (2004) who use SMP to model a possible security intrusion and \n\ncorresponding response of the fault tolerant software system to this event. Other related works \n\ninclude Littlewood et al. (2002), Levitin (2004), Levitin (2005) and Levitin (2006). \n\nIn the context of fault tolerant safety systems, some reliability assessment models have \n\nbeen developed. For example, Camarinopoulos and Obrowski (1981) propose a model for \n\nreliability quantification that takes into account the frequency as well as the duration of \n\nfailures. In that work, however, the TDT is considered constant, i.e., it does not have a \n\nstochastic behavior. \n\nBecker et al. (1994) and Chandra and Kumar (1997) use Markov processes (MP) in order \n\nto model safety systems with stochastic TDT. An MP is defined as a probabilistic model that \n\nsatisfies the memoryless Markov property. According to this assumption, the future behavior \n\nof a system depends only on its present state and therefore is independent on the sojourn time \n\nin this state. According to Ouhbi and Limnios (1997), however, such an assumption is not \n\nalways appropriate, since it is required to assume that sojourn times are exponentially \n\ndistributed. \n\nBecker et al. (2000) model the reliability of FTS through SMP. SMP is an extension of \n\nMarkov processes and as such they provide greater flexibility in terms of modeling complex \n\ndynamic systems. According to Howard (2007), SMP are not strictly Markovian anymore as \n\nthe Markov property is not required at all instants. However, as they share enough \n\ncharacteristics in common with these processes, SMP receive that denomination. Moreover, \n\nwhen non-homogeneous semi-Markov processes are considered, it is also possible to model a \n\nsystem that might be under improvement or aging processes. In this type of SMP, the future \n\nbehavior depends on two types of time variables: sojourn time and process time, being the \n\nlatter also known as calendar or global time. \n\nA common characteristic shared by the aforementioned reliability/availability assessment \n\nmodels is that the future behavior of a system is conditioned only on time variables, either \n\nprocess or sojourn times or both. In some situations, however, other factors not necessarily \n\ntime can influence the system behavior. Examples of such external factors include \n\nenvironmental variables (e.g., temperature, humidity), operational variables (e.g., hydrate and \n\nH2S concentration in oil flow), and physiological (e.g., fatigue) and/or psychological \n\nconditions (e.g., workload, stress). \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 6\n\nIn these cases, the system\u2019s future behavior might be influenced by sojourn time variable \n\nas well as by those external factors. To take it into account, it is possible to integrate \n\ncontinuous time homogeneous semi-Markov processes and Bayesian belief networks (BBN) \n\n(see Moura (2006) for greater details on the hybrid model: SMP and BBN). \n\nAs an example, assume that one is uncertain about the true value of the mean time to \n\nfailure (MTTF) of a downhole pumping oil system, i.e., one is interested in assessing the \n\nuncertainty distribution of MTTF. The BBN topology in Figure 1-1 characterizes how the \n\nrandom variable MTTF of the downhole pumping system is influenced by the variables \n\nBWSOT: \u201cPercentage of H2O and solids\u201d, PARAF: \u201cLevel of paraffin\u201d, FILTER: \n\n\u201cClassification of the filter installed\u201d, DEPTH_PUMP: \u201cDepth of the pump unit\u201d. \n\nAs it can be seen in Figure 1-1, BBN is composed of nodes, which represent the variables \n\nof interest (discrete or continuous), and arcs that characterize the cause-effect relationships \n\namong these variables. \n\n \n\nFigure 1-1 \u2013 BBN for MTTF of a pumping unit \n\nThe first step in setting up a BBN is the identification of random variables and their \n\nnature, i.e., whether they are discrete or continuous. Such values must be mutually exclusive. \n\nNext step is to designate the cause-effect relations among the relevant variables in order to \n\nconstruct the BBN topology. \n\nIn a BBN, a node is parent of a child node when there is an arc leaving the former in \n\ndirection to the latter. In Figure 1-1, for instance, the variable \u201cPARAF\u201d is a parent of \n\n\u201cBWSOT\u201d and \u201cMTTF\u201d. Any node with no parents is a root node, any node without children \n\nis a leaf node and any node that is neither a root nor leaf is an intermediary node. \n\n\u201cDEPTH_PUMP\u201d is a root node, \u201cMTTF\u201d is a leaf node and \u201cPARAF\u201d and \u201cBWSOT\u201d are \n\nintermediary nodes. \n\nAfter the construction of the BBN topology, next step is to determine the strengths of the \n\ncause-effect relations among the connected variables. This is carried out by specifying a \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 7\n\nconditional probability distribution for each node. For discrete random variables, this consists \n\nof establishing conditional probabilities tables CPT for each node. These CPT can be \n\ngenerated from either data bases or engineering judgments, as in Langseth and Portinale \n\n(2007). \n\nFor the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that all variables in the BBN of Figure 1-1 are \n\ndichotomic unless MTTF that can assume the following values {100, 200, 1.000, 10.000} \n\nhours. The CPT given in Appendix A were obtained from a data base according to the \n\nmethodology proposed in Barros Jr. (2006), where level 0 refers to an adequate condition and \n\nlevel 1 to an inadequate one. These CPT correspond to the prior distributions. \n\nIn this way, BBN is a graphic representation of a multivariate probability distribution \n\nwhere it is possible to represent cause-effect relations among random variables (Langseth and \n\nPortinale (2007)). Moreover, BBN provide flexibility in terms of knowledge updating through \n\nthe Bayes theorem (see Bernardo and Smith (1994) for basic concepts on Bayesian inference) \n\nas discussed in Firmino (2004). \n\nAs an example of how to integrate a homogeneous SMP with BBN, consider a downhole \n\npumping unit that pumps oil to a storage tank, which in turn is kept above a predetermined \n\nlevel L in order to be able to supply customers in case of a pumping unit failure. The tank \n\nlevel above L is set to a value such that a TDT holds before the oil level goes under L in case \n\nof a pumping unit failure. Therefore, upon the occurrence of this failure, it is assumed that \n\nrepair starts immediately in order to not go under this predetermined level and consequently \n\nthe TDT. Otherwise, the oil level in the storage tank goes under a low limit and the oil supply \n\nhalts. When the pumping unit is under repair and the TDT has not expired yet, no damage to \n\ncustomers is inflicted as oil can still be supplied, i.e., although in a degraded state the system \n\nis still available. However, when the tolerable downtime is reached and repair has not been \n\ncompleted yet, the system fails and it is assumed to be unavailable. \n\nIt is clear that the elapsed time since the start of repair activities plays a relevant role with \n\nrespect to system availability measure. Indeed, the system initially starts in state 1 (available) \n\nand upon failure (it is considered failure time follows an exponential distribution) of the \n\npumping unit it transits to state 2 (failed, under repair and TDT not exceeded), as shown in \n\nFigure 1-2. When state 2 is reached, a local clock is started such that when the sojourn time in \n\nthis state is greater than the TDT the system becomes unavailable, i.e., it transits to state 3 \n\n(failed, under repair and TDT exceeded). \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 8\n\nIn other words, the transition from state 2 to 3 depends on the elapsed time t since the \n\npumping unit has failed. In both cases (either states 2 or 3), it is assumed repair rate ? is \n\nconstant (see Figure 1-2). For the sake of simplicity, no failures are considered for pipelines, \n\nvalves and the storage tank. \n\nIt is also assumed the TDT (in this case, time for the system transits from state 2 to 3) is \n\ndistributed according to a Weibull distribution as follows: \n\n( ) ( )\n1\n\n23 exp\nt tf t\n\n? ??\n?? ?\n\n?\n? ? ? ?\n\n= ?? ?? ?\n? ?? ?\n\n, \n\nwhere ? and ? are scale and shape factors respectively. \n\nGiven that transitions outwards state 2 depend only on the sojourn time, it is considered a \n\nhomogeneous semi-Markov process in order to address this FTS. Otherwise, an MP could \n\nhave been chosen since in this case all transition rates would be constant. \n\nFurthermore, suppose that, as it might happen in situations of practical interest, the MTTF \n\ncharacterizing transitions from state 1 to state 2 is influenced by some external factors. As \n\ndiscussed above, the causal relationships among external factors related to a transition rate can \n\nbe characterized in terms of a BBN. As a result, availability measure of the pumping system \n\ncould be estimated from the hybrid model based on HSMP and BBN (see Moura and Droguett \n\n(2008) in Attachment A). \n\nIn particular, for the system under consideration, assume that the MTTF of the \n\nexponentially distributed time up to pumping unit failures (i.e., sojourn time in state 1) is \n\nuncertain and influenced by the external factors shown in Figure 1-1. \n\nMTTFf\n\n?\n?\n\n( )23 t?\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n\n100\n\n200\n\n1000\n\n10000\n\n \nFigure 1-2 \u2013 HSMP for the downhole pumping oil unit \n\nFigure 1-2 depicts an HSMP, which is described by transition rates ?ij(t), designed to \n\nmodel the oil pumping unit taking into account the influence of sojourn times and external \n\nfactors on the future behavior of the system. In Figure 1-2, fMTTF is marginal probability \n\ndistribution of the MTTF and it is obtained from the BBN in Figure 1-1. \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 9\n\nThe requisite data needed for solving this sort of SMP are the parameters of the \n\nprobability density functions (PDF) of the holding time in each state i given that system will \n\ngo towards state j. In this example, it means to estimate of ?, ? and ?. Moreover, as MTTF of \n\nthe transition from state 1 to 2 is uncertain, the CPT given in Appendix A are necessary to \n\nestimate the PDF on that parameter. \n\nThrough Figure 1-2, it is developed a model for a more realistic representation and \n\nquantification of availability measure for repairable FTS via the integration between \n\ncontinuous time HSMP and BBN. Such systems have a basic feature: the sojourn time in any \n\nstate influences the transition probabilities. Moreover, external factors (e.g., environmental \n\nand operational conditions) not necessarily time variables also impact the future behavior of \n\nthe system. Furthermore, as new evidence becomes available, the probability distributions of \n\nthese parameters as well as the state of knowledge about the behavior of the system can be \n\nupdated. \n\nThus, as the HSMP is described via transition rates then the integration between it and \n\nBBN is achieved through an interface represented by parameters of the intensity functions \n\ncharacterizing the transition rates. Such parameters are taken from BBN describing the cause \n\nand effect relationships among the relevant external factors and the corresponding parameters. \n\nThe resulting uncertainty distribution about a particular parameter is then taken as input \n\ninformation for the HSMP. \n\nIn order to explicitly quantify the impact of the uncertainty in the transition rates on the \n\nstate probabilities of the semi-Markov model, on the availability measure or on other relevant \n\nreliability metric, a numerical procedure for solving HSMP must be repeated for a \n\nconsiderable number of iterations. \n\nUsing the N2-method (given in Corradi et al. (2004)), which is hardly time-consuming, the \n\nsolution of the model in Figure 1-2 would become infeasible. Therefore, developing a faster \n\nand accurate way for solving HSMP is a must for practitioners who are used to face some sort \n\nof problems such as just described. \n\nThis example will be further discussed in chapter 4. In fact, it will be solved using 2N-, \n\nLap-, N2- and MC approaches which will be compared in terms of computational cost and \n\naccuracy. \n\nNext subsection presents another application of SMP. The problem characterization \n\nmainly draws from Droguett et al. (2007) and Droguett et al. (2008) which follow in \n\nattachments B and C respectively. \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 10\n\n1.2.2 Example 2: Optical Monitoring Systems \n\nOil has been the most important source of energy since the early days of last century. The \n\ngrowing and continuous demand for energy associated with decreasing availability of this \n\nlimited resource have led to a considerable increase in investment directed towards the \n\ndevelopment of renewable energy sources as well as to research efforts for optimizing \n\ntechnologies related to the exploration and production of oil.  \n\nMostly because of the increasing oil price, a considerable attention has been given to the \n\nenhancement of production technologies that allow for anticipation of oil production volumes \n\nand an improved reservoir management and control. In line with such efforts, recent \n\ndevelopments have led to the so called intelligent oil fields. The term \u2018intelligent\u2019 means: (i) \n\ndata acquisition: sensors provide data on important well parameters in real time; (ii) flow \n\nremote control: it allows an operator to modify production or injection flow characteristics \n\nwith no on-site intervention; (iii) data interpretation and optimization: it allows production \n\nand reservoir engineers feed simulation models and act on a particular well in real time. \n\nTherefore, intelligent oil field is a concept encompassing various technologies that allow for \n\nan integrated management of production and injection of one or several reservoirs. \n\nUnder these circumstances, availability is a key attribute: the higher availability the higher \n\nproduction volumes and therefore profit are. Moreover, in terms of intelligent oil fields, \n\nincreased availability levels associated with the anticipation of production volumes in relation \n\nto what is currently attained by a conventional oil field might serve as evidence for \n\njustification of the considerable steep investment in new technology. \n\nIn this context, a research effort is underway for designing and implementing intelligent oil \n\nfields in mature wells located in the Northeast of Brazil. Part of this effort concerns the in-\n\nhouse development and installation of pressure-temperature optical monitoring systems \n\n(OMS). \n\nAt the current stage, only a few units of these systems have been deployed for field tests \n\nand, given the limited experience, availability assessment is usually performed under a \n\nconsiderable level of uncertainty. In spite of that scenario, this limited experience has \n\nsuggested that an OMS might be comprised of components that are renewed after failures as \n\nwell as components that are under deteriorating processes with failure intensity functions that \n\nare dependent on the total system age (process time). \n\nUpon failure of the monitoring system, human performance during the reinstallation of an \n\nOMS (i.e., removing, repairing and then running an OMS in hole) is a relevant factor \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 11\n\ninfluencing its availability. Moreover, the time interval to accomplish the reinstallation plays \n\nan important role since it directly impacts the OMS availability as well as the human \n\nperformance during the effort to recover the system. In fact, under real life oil production \n\nconditions in the Northeast of Brazil, there exists an available time to complete the \n\nreinstallation (tolerable downtime). Otherwise, the OMS reinstallation in the field is not \n\nlonger feasible and, from the availability analysis perspective, it evolves to an unrecoverable \n\nstate \u2013 this tolerable downtime is one of the factors that directly influence the human \n\nperformance during the reinstallation and thus the OMS availability (see Droguett et al. \n\n(2008) for deeper details). \n\nTherefore, there are three relevant aspects in estimating the OMS availability: (i) the \n\navailable time to complete the reinstallation; (ii) the system deteriorating process and (iii) the \n\nmaintenance crew\u2019s performance, which is influenced by tolerable downtime and other factors \n\n(e.g., experience, fatigue) in returning an OMS to its normal operational condition. \n\nNHSMP may be used here in order to tackle the first two issues because: (i) the duration \n\n(sojourn time) in a state may influence the availability of an OMS and (ii) provided that some \n\ncomponents might be under deteriorating processes, it should be considered time dependent \n\ntransition intensity functions. In this context, the combined impact of these two time variables \n\non the reliability of an OMS will be assessed through an NHSMP. \n\nIndeed, OMS reinstallation process involves the repair of any possibly failed component \n\nas well as running the OMS system downhole. Thus, as it depicted in Figure 1-3, it is assumed \n\nthat the system (OMS) starts at normal operation in state 1. Upon a system failure, the \n\nreinstallation process of the OMS starts, which is represented by state 2. If the reinstallation \n\nprocess cannot be completed, the system goes to state 3 where additional actions are taken to \n\nrestore the system to its normal operating condition. If the operator is still not able to restore \n\nthe system, all actions are halted as represented by state 4. Thus, the system is not functioning \n\n(unavailable) when in states 2, 3 or 4. \n\n \n\nFigure 1-3 \u2013 Non-Homogeneous semi-Markov process for an OMS \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 12\n\nOMS reinstallation procedures involve complex operations that require interactions \n\nbetween human elements and equipments. Thus, to take into account the third relevant issue \n\n(the crew\u2019s performance in recovering an OMS), BBN could again be used to address \n\nqualitatively and quantitatively the cause-effect relationships among factors that impact the \n\nHuman Error Probability (HEP) during the reinstallation of an OMS. \n\nIn the context of the OMS reinstallation, the variables \u201cavailable time to complete the \n\nreinstallation\u201d and \u201cthe capacity to accomplish the task\u201d directly influence the probability of \n\nthe repairman to properly accomplish the procedure, as it can be seen in Figure 1-4. \n\n \n\nFigure 1-4 \u2013 BBN model for the OMS repairman \nFurthermore, according to Figure 1-4 the repairman is influenced by external factors. Two \n\nof these factors are considered here: climatic conditions (e.g., temperature and humidity) and \n\ndistracting agents (e.g., informal parallel chats in work environment, noise, glare, movement, \n\nflicker and color). These external factors associated with workload can cause fatigue (i.e., \n\nphysical and/or mental fatigues). Fatigue associated with emotional state can influence the \n\nattention of the repairman to the current task. It is possible, for example, that due to fatigue \n\nand an unfavorable emotional state, the attention level is negatively impacted. It is considered \n\nthat three factors can influence the repairman capacity to carry out his activities: attention, \n\nskills and experience. Attention refers to whether sufficient cognitive and physical resources \n\nare put at the \u201cright\u201d places. Skills are the ability to understand situations and perform needed \n\nactions without much cognitive activity. Deficiency of skills can manifest itself in reduced job \n\nquality and time delay. Experience is the accumulation of information and knowledge \n\nacquired through direct or indirect interactions with the system (see Chang and Mosleh \n\n(2007)). The repairman performance measured by the HEP is directly influenced by his \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 13\n\ncapacity to carry out the task and the available time to complete the reinstallation. Both \n\nfactors are considered to have major impact on the HEP, thus they are parents of the \u201chuman \n\nerror\u201d node. For a detailed discussion on how a Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) is \n\nperformed, see Men\u00eazes (2005). Table 1-1 summarizes the BBN nodes and the levels which \n\nthey can assume. \n\nTable 1-1 \u2013 Variables and their levels \n\nVariable Levels \n0 1 \n\nHuman Error Yes No \nAvailable time to complete reinstallation Adequate Inadequate \n\nCapacity to accomplish the task Adequate Inadequate \nExperience Average High \nAttention Adequate Inadequate \n\nSkills Adequate Inadequate \nEmotional State Adequate Inadequate \n\nFatigue Adequate Inadequate \nWorkload Adequate Inadequate \n\nExternal Factors Adequate Inadequate \nDistracting Agents Yes No \n\nClimatic Conditions Adequate Inadequate \n\nThus, when the system is in state 2, it is assumed that the operator has an appropriate \n\navailable time to complete the reinstallation tasks. Under this situation, the probability p23 \n\ncorresponds to the HEP under a condition of \u201cadequate available time to complete the repair \n\n(evidence 0)\u201d. If the operator does not complete the reinstallation in the allotted time frame, \n\nthe system transits to state 3. In this state, the operator takes additional actions to restore the \n\nsystem but now under a time pressure situation, i.e., it is considered that a substantially \n\nreduced time frame is available to restore the system to its normal operating condition. \n\nCorrespondingly, the HEP p34 reflects the situation of \u201cinadequate available time to complete \n\nthe repair (evidence 1)\u201d. In both cases (states 2 and 3), if the operator ends the reinstallation \n\nwithin the available time, the system returns to its normal operating condition (state 1). \n\nOtherwise, the system transits to state 4. \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 14\n\n \n\nFigure 1-5 \u2013 A semi-Markov model with Bayesian belief network based human error probability for availability \n\nassessment of downhole optical monitoring systems \n\nTherefore, when the system enters states 2 or 3, the BBN node \u201chuman error\u201d is directly \n\nconnected to the probabilities (parameters) of the NHSMP of Figure 1-3 what can be seen in \n\nFigure 1-5. Thus, the parameters p23 and p34 are the HEP in the BBN of Figure 1-4 given the \n\nevidences 0 and 1, respectively. The parameters p21 and p31 are the respective complements of \n\np23 and p34. \n\nIn this way, the conditioning factors influencing the error probability of an OMS \n\nrepairman as well as the cause-effect relationships among them are taken into account for the \n\navailability assessment of an OMS via the continuous-time NHSMP. \n\nAs it may be noticed in the preceding description, the requisite data needed for solving \n\nthis NHSMP are different from those for example 1. Indeed, Figure 1-3 illustrates an NHSMP \n\ndescribed by transition probabilities. The required data to estimate the system (un)availability \n\nover time via this type of NHSMP are the transition probabilities pij( ? ) and the conditional \n\nCumulative Distribution Function (CDF) Gij( ? , ? ). These terms will be further described in \n\ndetail in next chapter. \n\nDue to the lack of a robust and efficient method to solve the example just described, \n\nDroguett et al. (2008) have solved it by using MC. Another possibility is to resort to the N2-\n\nmethod drawn for NHSMP in Janssen and Manca (2001). However, due to computational \n\ntime reasons this approach becomes impracticable. \n\nTherefore, the 2N-method for NHSMP will be developed in chapter 5. Then in chapter 6, \n\nthe example described in the present section will be widely solved by using the 2N-method. \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 15\n\n1.2.3 Contributions \n\nActually, examples 1 and 2 address the availability assessment problem with somewhat no \n\nuse of simplistic assumptions on the system\u2019s behavior. However, trying to approach as much \n\nas possible towards reality requires a price to be paid. In these cases, the penalty corresponds \n\nto the intricacy and complexity of mathematical and numerical formulations involved with \n\nSMP what also implies impracticable computational times. \n\nIndeed, traditionally examples 1 and 2 could be solved by using N2-method given in \n\nCorradi et al. (2004) (HSMP) and Janssen and Manca (2001) (NHSMP), respectively. \n\nHowever, both of them are rather cumbersome with a computational cost greater than MC. \n\nThis situation motivates the development of a novel and more efficient (faster) \n\nmathematical and numerical formulation for SMP that has less computational effort, but keeps \n\nthe accuracy in relation to the available methods in the related literature, that is, MC \n\nsimulation and the N2-approach. In fact, the 2N-mathematical formulation and numerical \n\ntreatment consists of casting the N2 coupled integral equations into an initial value problem \n\ninvolving transition frequency densities, and then solve N coupled integral equations with one \n\nvariable and N straightforward integrations. As it will be proved in next chapters, this \n\napproach possesses both abovementioned features: it is significantly less time-consuming and \n\nhas roughly accuracy equals to the N2-method. \n\nSpecifically regarding NHSMP, although they are powerful modeling tools, the \n\nmathematical and computational difficulties of the non-homogeneous environment are usually \n\nblamed as accountable for the scarcity of applications of this type of stochastic process. Thus, \n\nthis thesis plays an important role as an attempt to increase the feasibility of application of this \n\nkind of stochastic model. \n\nMoreover, this thesis describes another alternative method (called Lap-approach) for \n\nsolving the state probability equations of an HSMP on continuous time. This numerical \n\nprocedure is based on the application of LT. As there will be seen in detail, the main \n\nadvantage of this approach is that it is not required adjusting the number of steps in order to \n\nobtain the desired convergence. There will be a pre-set number of steps, which is independent \n\non the problem to be solved and thus, this method is likely to have a considerable reduced \n\ncomputational effort in relation to the abovementioned 2N- and N2-methods and MC as well. \n\nFinally, the 2N-mathematical formulation and numerical approach will also be illustrated \n\nby means of some examples of application in the context of reliability assessment (including \n\nthose which have been described in the two previous sections), where the effectiveness and \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 16\n\nthe required computational effort of the 2N-method will be compared against the MC and the \n\nN2- and Lap-approaches. \n\n1.3 Objectives \n\n1.3.1 General Objective \n\nDeveloping a novel mathematical formulation and a faster numerical treatment for solving \n\non continuous time (homogeneous and non-homogeneous) semi-Markov processes described \n\nthrough either transition rates or transition probabilities. \n\n1.3.2 Specific Objectives \n\n Surveying at the theoretical background of homogenous and non-homogeneous semi-\n\nMarkov processes; \n\n Surveying at the N2-method: numerical perspective; \n\n Developing the 2N-mathematical formulation and numerical treatment for HSMP; \n\n Developing the Lap-numerical treatment for HSMP; \n\n Developing the 2N-mathematical formulation and numerical treatment for NHSMP; \n\n Implementing numerically on C++ platform the solutions for 2N-, Lap-, N2- approaches \n\nand MC simulation in order to make comparisons among them in terms of computational \n\ntime and accuracy; \n\n Applying the abovementioned methods to solve some examples in the context of \n\nreliability engineering in order to evaluate their effectiveness in terms of computational \n\ncost and accuracy. \n\n1.3 Thesis Layout \n\nThe remainder of this thesis is organized as follows. Next chapter presents the theoretical \n\nbackground related to SMP: HSMP and NHSMP described through either transition \n\nprobabilities or transition rates. Chapter 3 (section 3.1) develops the 2N-method for \n\nhomogeneous semi-Markov processes. In this chapter, the mathematical formulation \n\ninvolving transition frequency densities and the description of the numerical method \n\n(including the analysis of the discretization error) will be described. Chapter 3 (section 3.2) \n\nalso describes the Lap-numerical method for HSMP. This method is composed of the \n\napplication of LT and its corresponding inversion. Both issues will be discussed in that \n\nchapter. In chapter 4, comparisons among 2N-, N2-, Lap- and MC approaches will be made \n\nthrough some examples of application. Chapter 5 will show the description of the 2N-method \n\n\n\nChapter 1                                                                                                                   Introduction \n\n 17\n\nfor NHSMP. As for HSMP, in this chapter, the mathematical formulation and the numerical \n\ntreatment (including also the analysis of the discretization error) will be discussed taking into \n\naccount non-homogeneity issues. Chapter 6 will challenge the effectiveness of the 2N-method \n\ndrawn for NHSMP against the results from N2- and MC approaches. In this chapter, the \n\nexample 2 described in section 1.2.2 will be solved using the 2N-method. Next, chapter 7 \n\npresents two further examples. The first one will show how the 2N-method may be used for \n\ndetermining a maintenance optimization policy so that to maximize the mean availability \n\nmeasure. The second example is also inserted inside the optimization context. Basically, it is \n\ndesigned for determining which maintenance decisions should be made so that the mean \n\navailability and expected costs are jointly optimized over the system\u2019s age. Thus, the Lap-\n\nmethod will be used to estimate the mean availability in this framework. Finally, chapter 8 \n\npresents some conclusions, discussing final remarks and challenges for ongoing and future \n\nresearch. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 2                                                                                                Theoretical Background \n\n 18\n\n2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND: SEMI-MARKOV PROCESSES \n\n2.1. Applications and terminology \n\nAccording to Howard (2007), an SMP can be understood as a probabilistic model in which \n\nthe successive occupation of states is governed by the transition probabilities of an MP, \n\nknown as embedded MP, but the sojourn times in each state is described by a random variable \n\nthat depends on the current state and on the state to which the next transition will be done. \n\nIn an SMP, the Markov property is required only at the transition times between states \n\nand, therefore, it is not strictly Markovian. Thus, the sojourn time distribution can be arbitrary, \n\nfollowing any probability density function not necessarily exponential. \n\nSome recent scientific developments on SMP may be quoted. Grabski (2003) presents the \n\nproperties of the reliability function of a component under a random load process with failure \n\nrate modeled according to an SMP. The reliability functions were obtained through \n\napplication of Laplace-Stieltjes transforms to transition probability equations and, by using a \n\ncommercial computational software, the analytical solution of the inverse transform were \n\nobtained.  \n\nOuhbi and Limnios (2003) introduce non-parametric estimators for the reliability and \n\navailability of SMP by assessing the asymptotical properties of these types of metrics. A \n\nmethod to compute confidence intervals for such estimators is proposed and an example of \n\napplication is given for a three state SMP. Limnios and Oprisan (2001) demonstrate some \n\nresults and applications of SMP in the context of reliability. \n\nPievatolo and Valad\u00e8 (2003) assess the reliability of electrical systems in situations of \n\ncontinuous operation. An analytical model is developed which allows for non-exponential \n\ndistributions of failure and repair times. SMP are used to compute the mean time between \n\nfailures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) of a compensator output voltage. \n\nEl-Gohary (2004) presents maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimators for reliability \n\nparameters of semi-Markovian models. Other recent works that have SMP as main issue are \n\nAfchain (2004), Chen and Trivedi (2005), Limnios and Ouhbi (2006), Xie et al. (2005), \n\nSoszynska (2006) and Jenab and Dhillon (2006). \n\nA common characteristic of the aforementioned works is that defining an SMP requires \n\nthe specification of N2 probabilities of the embedded MP and N2 conditional probability \n\ndensity functions of the sojourn times in each state given the next state. This is the usual \n\n\n\nChapter 2                                                                                                Theoretical Background \n\n 19\n\ndefinition of SMP which is presented in most of related literature, for example in Ross (1997) \n\nand Limnios and Oprisan (2001). \n\nHowever, in the context of reliability engineering, transition rates rather than transition \n\nprobabilities are also usually employed to define continuous time MP and, therefore, \n\ntransition rates should be attractive for defining SMP as well. Indeed, Becker et al. (2000) \n\ndevelop the mathematical formulation of SMP described through transition rates. Such \n\ntransition rates are different from those of MP which are either constant (homogeneous \n\nMarkov processes) or dependent on process time (non-homogeneous Markov processes). \n\nIn fact, the transition rates of an SMP may only depend on sojourn time in a state for the \n\ncase of an HSMP, or both sojourn and process times for an NHSMP. In both cases, the \n\ntransition rates can be used to represent failure and repair rates as for MP. \n\nBoth ways (transition probabilities and transition rates) will be used in next two sections \n\nto define SMP. In this way, the mathematical and numerical developments which will be \n\nproposed in chapters 3 and 5 could address SMP described through either transition \n\nprobabilities or transition rates in the same fashion. \n\n2.2. Homogeneous semi-Markov processes \n\nHSMP in continuous time are introduced in this section using a similar nomenclature to \n\nthe one given in Corradi et al. (2004). Let { }1,...,S N=  represent the finite state space and \n\ndefine the following random variables: \n\n: , : [0, [,n nZ S T? ? ? ? ?   \n\nwhere nZ  and nT  are, respectively, the state and the time in the n\nth transition. \n\nThe process ( ),n nZ T  is called homogeneous Markov renewal process if \n\n1 1 1 1 0 0\n\n1 1\n\nPr[ , | , , , ,..., , ]\n\nPr[ , | ]\n\nn n n n n n n\n\nn n n n\n\nZ j T T t Z T Z T Z T\n\nZ j T T t Z i\n\n+ + ? ?\n\n+ +\n\n= ? ?\n\n= = ? ? =\n.  \n\nThe kernel Cij(t) of an HSMP is defined as: \n\n( ) 1 1Pr[ , | ].ij n n n nC t Z j T T t Z i+ += = ? ? =  (2-1)\n\nEq. (2-1) is the probability of the HSMP to reach state j at time 1nT +  given that it has \n\nremained in state i for 1n nT T t+ ? ? . According to Howard (2007), the kernel Cij(t) is the \n\nfundamental describer of an HSMP as its elements determine the transitions between states as \n\nwell as the sojourn time (t) both conditioned on the current state (i). \n\nIt follows that: \n\n\n\nChapter 2                                                                                                Theoretical Background \n\n 20\n\n1Pr[ | ] lim ( ), ,ij n n ij\nt\n\np Z j Z i C t i j S?\n??\n\n= = = = ? ,  \n\nwhere P = [pij] is the matrix of transition probabilities of the continuous-time embedded \n\nhomogeneous Markov process (EHMP), which is the homogeneous Markov process relevant \n\nto the HSMP. \n\nHSMP will leave state i after it has stayed there for t with probability given by: \n\n[ ]1( ) Pr |i n n nF t T T t Z i+= ? ? = , (2-2)\nwhich represents the CDF of the waiting time in state i. \n\nEq.

Given the current (i) and next (j) states, the sojourn time (t) in state (i) is sampled \n\nfrom the CDF Gij(t). Thus, the next transition time (tn+1) is determined as tn+1 = tn + t. \n\nThe future behavior of an HSMP over time may be assessed through its interval transition \n\nprobabilities ?ij(t)=Pr[Zt=j | Z0=i], Z = (Zt, t ? 0R\n+ ), which are given as follows (see Corradi \n\net al.

Eq. (2-3) assumes that the kernel Cij(t) is absolutely continuous with respect to the \n\nsojourn time. \n\nEq. (2-3), which is a set of convolution integral equations, is interpreted as follows: the \n\nfirst part represents the probability of the process to remain in state i from 0 to t, with no state \n\nchange in this time interval. The second part represents the probability of the process to stay \n\nin state i during the sojourn time ?, transiting to the intermediary state k at this time and from \n\nthis state to j at time t, remaining (t - ?) in state k with t > ?. \n\nWhen an HSMP is defined in this way, it is said that this process is described through \n\ntransition probabilities. However, in the context of reliability engineering, transition rates ?ij(t) \n\nrather than transition probabilities could also be attractive to define HSMP. Indeed, Becker et \n\nal. (2000) and Ouhbi and Limnios (1999) have modified eq. (2-3) in order to handle HSMP \n\ndescribed through transition rates as follows: \n\n0\n\n1 0 0\n\n( ) exp( ( ) )\n\n( ) exp( ( ) ) ( )\n\nt\n\nij ij i\n\ntN\n\nik i kj\nk\n\nt x dx\n\nx dx t d\n?\n\n? ? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?\n=\n\n= ? +\n\n+ ? ?\n\n?\n\n?? ?\n, (2-4)\n\nwhere )(tij?  is the transition rate of an HSMP defined as: \n\n1 1 1( ) { ( , ) ( ) | ( ) },ij n n n n n nt dt P T T t t dt Z T j Z T i T T t? ? ? ?= ? ? + ? = = ? ? > (2-5)\n\nEq. (2-5) indicates that a transition to state j occurs in an infinitesimal time interval after \n\nthe process has remained in state i for duration t, given that no transition leaving this state has \n\noccurred. Moreover, ( )i? ?  is the transition rate leaving state i and is given by the following \n\nequation: \n\n1\n\n( ) ( )\nN\n\ni ik\nk\n\n? ?\n=\n\n? = ?? .  \n\nThe interpretation of eq. (2-4) is the same as the one provided for (2-3).

(2004) have developed a numerical method for HSMP directly applying a \n\ngeneral numerical quadrature method to equation (2-3) (i.e., only for NHSMP described by \n\n\n\nChapter 2                                                                                                Theoretical Background \n\n 22\n\ntransition probabilities). However, the computational cost of this numerical solution is \n\nconsiderably high mainly because it involves solving N2 coupled integral equations with one \n\nvariable in the time domain, t. \n\nAlthough the numerical method proposed by Corradi et al. (2004) has been originally \n\ndeveloped to handle HSMP described through transition probabilities (eq. (2-3)), it is likely to \n\nbe extended to address HSMP described through transition rates for which the interval \n\ntransition probabilities are given in equation (2-4). \n\nThus, in chapter 3 (section 3.1) it is presented a novel mathematical formulation for \n\nHSMP (described through either transition probabilities (eqs. (2-1) and (2-2)) or transition \n\nrates (eqs. (2-6) and (2-7))) as an initial value problem involving transition frequency \n\ndensities. Moreover, in the same chapter a numerical and straightforward treatment for this \n\nnew mathematical is drawn as an attempt to reduce the inherent computational cost that is \n\npresent in the solution of HSMP through the N2-method. As it said, this approach is called 2N- \n\ndue to its complexity.  \n\nMoreover, in chapter 3 (section 3.2) there will be proposed an alternative method to the \n\n2N- and N2-methods for solving the interval convolution transition probability equations of an \n\nHSMP on continuous time. Taking advantage of the convolution feature present in \n\nhomogenous environment, this numerical procedure is based on the application of LT which \n\nwill be inverted by using the Gauss quadrature method known as Gauss Legendre. Basically, \n\nLT plays an important role since they will change the integral domain by an algebraic \n\nenvironment which is likely to reduce the computational time of the solution. \n\nComparisons in terms of computational time and accuracy among the N2-, 2N- and Lap- \n\nmethods and Monte Carlo simulation will be accomplished in chapter 4 in order to validate \n\nthe effectiveness of the proposed models for solving HSMP. \n\n2.3. Non-Homogeneous semi-Markov processes \n\nNHSMP are introduced here using a similar nomenclature to the one given in Janssen and \n\nManca (2001). Thus, let define the following random variables: \n\n: , : [0, [,n nZ S T? ? ? ? ?   \n\nwhere nZ , nT  and 1n n nX T T ?= ?  are the state, process time, and sojourn time in the n\nth \n\ntransition, respectively. \n\nThe process ( ),n nZ T  is called non-homogeneous Markov renewal process if \n\n\n\nChapter 2                                                                                                Theoretical Background \n\n 23\n\n1 1 1 1 0 0\n\n1 1\n\nPr[ , | , , , ,..., , ]\n\nPr[ , | , ]\n\nn n n n n n\n\nn n n n\n\nZ j T t Z i T l Z T Z T\n\nZ j T t Z i T l\n\n+ + ? ?\n\n+ +\n\n= ? = =\n\n= = ? = =\n.  \n\nThe kernel Cij( ? , ? ) of an NHSMP is defined as: \n\n( ) 1 1, Pr[ , | , ]ij n n n nC l t Z j T t Z i T l+ += = ? = = . (2-8)\n\nEq. (2-8) is the probability of the process to reach state j at the time 1nT t+ ?  given that it \n\nhas reached state i at the time l, and remained there for 1nX x+ ? . The kernel Cij( ? , ? ) is the \n\nfundamental describer of an NHSMP as its elements determine the transitions between states, \n\nthe time of the next transition (t) and then sojourn time (x) conditioned on the current state (i) \n\nand the last transition time (l). \n\nIt follows that: \n\n( ) 1 1Pr[ | , ] lim ( , ), ,ij n n n ij\nt\n\np l Z j Z i T l C l t i j S? ?\n??\n\n= = = = = ? ,  \n\nwhere P(l) = [pij(l)] is the matrix of transition probabilities of the continuous-time embedded \n\nnon-homogeneous Markov process (ENHMP), which is the non-homogeneous Markov \n\nprocess associated to the NHSMP. \n\nNHSMP will leave state i within the time interval from l to t with probability given by: \n\n[ ]1( , ) Pr | ,i n n nF l t T t Z i T l+= ? = = , (2-9)\nwhich represents the CDF of the waiting time in state i. \n\nEqs. (2-8) and (2-9) are related as follows: \n\n1\n( , ) ( , )\n\nN\ni ijj\n\nF l t C l t\n=\n\n=? .  \nIn fact, ( , )iF ? ?  means the probability that the NHSMP leaves state i when its successor \n\nstate j is unknown. \n\nThe conditional CDF of the sojourn time in the current state (i) given the next state (j) to \n\nbe occupied by the process and the last transition time (l) is given as: \n\n( ) [ ]1 1, Pr | , , .ij n n n nG l t T t Z i Z j T l+ += ? = = =   \nThe probabilities are related as follows: \n\n( ) ( )\n( , )\n\n, ( ) 0,\n,\n\n1 , .\n\nij\nij\n\nijij\n\nC l t\nif p l\n\np lG l t\notherwise\n\n?\n??\n\n= ?\n?\n?\n\n  \n\nAccording to D\u2019amico et al. (2005), the main difference between a non-homogeneous \n\nMarkov process and an NHSMP is on the CDF Gij(l,t). In a Markovian environment, such \n\n\n\nChapter 2                                                                                                Theoretical Background \n\n 24\n\nfunctions must be exponential negative whereas in a semi-Markov context Gij(l,t) may be \n\narbitrary and not necessarily exponential. \n\nBasically, an NHSMP works in the following way: when state i is reached at the time l, \n\nthe next state j to be occupied by the process is immediately drawn from the transition \n\nprobabilities pij(l) of the ENHMP. Given the current (i) and next (j) states and the last \n\ntransition time (l), the sojourn time (x) in state (i) is sampled from the CDF Gij(? , ? ). Thus, the \n\nnext transition time (t) is determined as t = l + x. \n\nThe future behavior of NHSMP over time is assessed through its interval transition \n\nprobabilities ?ij(l,t)=Pr[Zt=j | Zl=i], Z = (Zt, t ? 0R\n+ ), which are given as follows (see Janssen \n\nand Manca (2001)): \n\n( )\n1\n\n( , ) 1 ( , ) ( , ) ( , )\ntN\n\nikij ij i kj\nk l\n\nl t F l t C l t d? ? ? ? ? ?\n=\n\n= ? + ???\ni\n\n (2-10)\n\nwhere \n( ) ( , )\n\n( , )\nij ij\n\nij\nd p l G l t\n\nC l t\ndl\n\n? ??? ?=\ni\n\n is the derivative of the kernel of the NHSMP in relation to l, \n\nand ?ij is the Kronecker\u2019s delta for which holds ?ij = 1 if i = j and ?ij = 0, otherwise. Eq. (2-10) \n\nassumes that the kernel Cij( ? , ? ) is absolutely continuous with respect to the process time. \n\nEq. (2-10) is interpreted as follows. The first part represents the probability of the process \n\nto remain in state i from l to t, with no state change in this time interval. The second part \n\nrepresents the probability of the process to reach state i at the time l, and the intermediary \n\nstate k at the time ?, and to transit from this state to j at the time t, remaining (x = ? - l) in the \n\nstate i and (x = t - ?) in the state k before reaching the state j at t, with t > ? > l. \n\nTransition rates that depend on both types of time variables (sojourn and process) may \n\noccur in problems of practical interest, for example, in FTS which are under deteriorating \n\nprocesses (see Moura (2006), for example). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a non-\n\nhomogeneous semi-Markovian model described by transition rates which depend on both \n\nsojourn and process times. \n\nBecker et al. (2000) defined the transition rate of an NHSMP as follows: \n\n( , ) Pr{ ( , ) ( ) | ( )\n\n}.\n\nij l t dx t l x x dx Z t j Z l\n\ni t l x\n\n? = ? ? + ? =\n\n= ? ? >\n (2-11)\n\nEq. (2-11) represents a transition to state j which occurs in an infinitesimal time interval \n\nafter the process has reached state i at time l, given that no transition leaving such a state \n\noccurred before. Note that both t and l represent process times, but l is the time of the last \n\ntransition so that t=x+l as occurs for NHSMP described by transition probabilities. \n\n\n\nChapter 2                                                                                                Theoretical Background \n\n 25\n\nTo obtain the interval transition probabilities of an NHSMP defined by transition rates, \n\none has to consider that the process is non-homogeneous in relation to the process time. Thus, \n\n?(l,t) are given as follows: \n\n( )\n\n( )\n1\n\n( , ) exp ,\n\n( , ) exp , ( , ) .\n\nt\n\nij ij i\nl\n\ntN\n\nik i kj\nk l l\n\nl t l t dx\n\nl l x dx t d\n?\n\n? ? ?\n\n? ? ? ? ? ?\n=\n\n? ?\n? ?= ?\n? ?\n? ?\n\n? ?\n? ?+ ?\n? ?\n? ?\n\n?\n\n?? ?\n (2-12)\n\nEq. (2-12) means the same of eq. (2-10). The only idiosyncrasy regards the kernel Cij( ? ) \n\nand the CDF Fi( ? ) since they are defined in a different way as follows: \n\n( )( , ) ( , ) exp ,\nt\n\nij ik i\nl l\n\nC l t l l dx dz\n?\n\n? ? ? ?\n? ?\n? ?= ?\n? ?\n? ?\n\n? ?

(2-10) and (2-12) are not of convolution type as is for the case of \n\nhomogeneous semi-Markov processes (see previous section). In this way, the LT technique \n\nthat is widely applied for HSMP could not be used in the non-homogeneous environment. \n\nTherefore, Janssen and Manca (2001) have developed the N2-numerical method for \n\nNHSMP directly applying a general numerical quadrature method to eq. (2-10) (i.e., only for \n\nNHSMP described by transition probabilities). However, the computational cost of this \n\nnumerical solution is considerably high mainly because it involves the solution of N2 non-\n\nconvolution coupled integral equations and with two variables in the time domain, l and t. \n\nThus, in chapter 5 it is developed a novel mathematical formulation for NHSMP \n\n(described through either transition probabilities (eqs. (2-8) and (2-9)) or transition rates (eqs. \n\n(2-13) and (2-14)) as an initial value problem involving transition frequency densities. \n\nMoreover, in the same chapter a numerical and straightforward treatment for this new \n\nmathematical is drawn as an attempt to reduce the inherent computational cost that plagues \n\nthe solution of NHSMP through the N2-method. This approach is called 2N- due to its \n\ncomplexity. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 3                                                                    Solving HSMP: 2N- and Lap- approaches \n\n 26\n\n3. SOLVING HOMOGENEOUS SEMI-MARKOV PROCESSES: 2N- \nAND LAP- APPROACHES \n\n3.1. 2N-method: Mathematical Formulation and Numerical Treatment \n\nThe mathematical and numerical treatments, which is called 2N-method and will be \n\ndeveloped in this chapter, is put forward as an attempt for untangling the inherent \n\ncomputational cost that plagues the solution of HSMP via the classical method given in \n\nCorradi et al. (2004). \n\nBasically, by changing N2-effort by 2N-complexity, the 2N-approach tends to reduce \n\nconsiderably the computational effort in relation to the N2-method and MC simulation as well, \n\nkeeping the accuracy of the abovementioned approaches. The main findings of this section \n\ncan be encountered in Moura and Droguett (2009d) which follows in attachment D. \n\n3.1.1. An initial value problem involving transition frequency densities \n\nDepending on how an HSMP is described, the kernel Cij( ? ) and the CDF Fi( ? ) are given \n\nby equations (2-1) and (2-2) in case of transition probabilities or by equations (2-6) and (2-7) \n\nin case of transition rates. The 2N-numerical approach will be developed in a general way in \n\norder to handle both situations. \n\nThus, an initial value problem consists of computing the probabilities ?j(t) given the initial \n\nconditions ?j(0). By using a similar nomenclature to the one given in Becker et al. (2000), let \n\nNj(t) be the number of times that state j of an HSMP is visited from any state in the interval \n\n[0,t]. Let also Hj(t) = E[Nj(t)] be its expected value. If Hj(t) is continuously differentiable, then \n\nhj(t)dt = dHj(t) is its corresponding density function. \n\nAs the stochastic process under consideration is regular, i.e., no more than one transition \n\ncan occur in any interval (t, t+dt), then hj(t) can be assumed as the probability that a transition \n\noccurs to state j in an infinitesimal time interval dt as follows: \n\nhj(t)dt=Pr{to reach state j in (t, t+dt)}.  \n\nThus, it follows that: \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n1 1 0\n\n0 ( ) .\ntN N\n\nijj i ij i\ni i\n\nh t C t h C t d? ? ? ?\n= =\n\n= ? + ? ?? ??\ni i\n\n (3-1)\n\nAccording to the description of eq. (2-1), (3-1) means state j can be reached either if the \n\nprocess was initially in state i and remains there until time t, when a transition to state j \n\noccurs; or if the process reached state i at time ?, remaining there for x = t ? ?, then a \n\n\n\nChapter 3                                                                    Solving HSMP: 2N- and Lap- approaches \n\n 27\n\ntransition to state j occurs. The summation over the state number N is for all possible \n\nintermediary states, where HSMP can transit. The integral term in turn means that the \n\ntransition to state i may occur in any time ? ? [0,t]. \n\nEq. (3-1) corresponds to a system of N integral equations with unknowns hj(t), j = 1,\u2026,N. \n\nThe probabilities ?j(t)=Pr[Zt=j | Z0] can be obtained from the initial conditions ?j(0) as \n\nfollows: \n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n0\n\n0 [1 ( )] [1 ( )]\nt\n\nj j j j jt F t h F t d? ? ? ? ?= ? ? + ? ? ?? . (3-2)\n\nEq. (3-2) argues that a process can be in state j in time t either if it was initially in the state \n\nj and remained there at least up to time t; or if it visited state j at any time ? ? [0,t] with \n\nprobability hj(t) and stayed there for (t ? ?). Eq. (3-2) corresponds to N straightforward \n\nintegrations that can be solved independently by using the solution of equation (3-1). \n\nThus, eqs. (3-1) and (3-2) extend the formulation presented in Becker et al. (2000) in order \n\nto address HSMP described in terms of both transition probabilities and transition rates. \n\nThe computational effort to solve eqs. (3-1) and (3-2) is less demanding than in the case of \n\nthe N2-method described in Corradi et al. (2004). In fact, the 2N-method consists of solving N \n\ncoupled convolution integral equations with one variable (eq. (3-1)) and N straightforward \n\nintegrations (eq. (3-2)) whereas the N2-method consists of solving N2 coupled convolution \n\nintegral equations. Comparisons among the 2N-approach, the N2-method and the Monte \n\nCarlo-based solution will be presented in chapter 4. Before that, a general quadrature based \n\nmethod for simultaneously solving equations (3-1) and (3-2) is presented in next section. \n\n3.1.2. Numerical formulation \n\n3.1.2.1.

(3-19). The same conclusion was reached in Corradi et al. \n\n(2004) for the N2-method. In other words, the same upper limit of the discretization error in \n\nsolving the interval transition probabilities via N2-method is found when hj(t) is approximated \n\nvia eq. (3-4). \n\nHowever, the upper limit of the 2N-discretization error function should also take into \n\naccount the error made in eq. (3-11). Actually, the error estimate ( ) ( )( )kj jjh kh kh? ? ?= ?  in \n\ncomputing ( )j t?  through eq. (3-11) given the solution of (3-4) depends only on the choice of \n\nthe quadrature method. In eq. (3-12), for instance, the error term is equal to ( )4( ) 1/kj jh O k? = . \n\n\n\nChapter 3                                                                    Solving HSMP: 2N- and Lap- approaches \n\n 34\n\nThis means that the true answer ( )j kh?  differs from the estimate ( )j kh?  by an amount equals \n\nto 41/ k  (see Press et al. (2002) for further details) which tends to zero when k increases. \n\nDisregarding the inequality in eq. (3-19), the most important finding encountered in the \n\npreceding developments is that even though 2N-method has a greater discretization error than \n\nN2-approach their accuracy will approximately be equal when the number M of steps \n\nincreases. \n\nIn other words, for the same M, the 2N-approach tends to be significantly less time-\n\nconsuming and has rough accuracy to the N2-method. In chapter 5, when the 2N-method \n\ndrawn for NHSMP will be discussed the inequality in eq. (3-19) will again be considered. \n\n3.2. Lap-method: A Laplace-based numerical procedure to solve the state \nprobability equations of HSMP \n\nIn the present section the Lap-procedure is discussed. This numerical method is also \n\ndrawn for HSMP described through either transition probabilities or transition rates. Basically, \n\nit is based on the application of Laplace transforms which will be inverted by using the Gauss \n\nquadrature method known as Gauss Legendre. \n\nAs it will be seen, conversely to the 2N- and N2-approaches, the main advantage of this \n\napproach is that it is not required adjusting the number M of steps in order to obtain desired \n\nconvergence. There will be a pre-set number of steps, which is independent on the problem to \n\nbe solved and thus, this method is likely to have a considerable reduced computational effort \n\nin relation to the 2N- and N2-methods and MC as well. In other words, the features of this \n\nmethod will quit the need of previously specifying a number M of steps for each problem, thus \n\nreducing time for performing calculus. The main developments of this chapter may be found \n\nin Moura and Droguett (2008) and Moura and Droguett (2009b) which follow in attachments \n\nA and E respectively. \n\n3.2.1.

(3-23)\n\nNotice this formulation is general since it can address HSMP described by transition \n\nprobabilities or transition rates. The only difference is how kernel is defined: either by eq. \n\n(2-1) for transition probabilities or (2-6) for transition rates. \n\nIn order to compute the state probabilities of HSMP, the Lap-procedure is based on the \n\napplication of the LT to these equations and the corresponding inversion to obtain the solution \n\non time domain t . \n\nIndeed, by applying LT to eq. (3-23), taking into account that the LT of the convolution of \n\ntwo independent functions ( ( )C ?\ni\n\n and ( )H ? ) is equal to the product between their individual LT \n\nand using ( )f s  as the LT of a function ( )f t , it follows that: \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )*\nT T T T\n\nH s A s K s H s? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?= +? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , (3-24)\n\nwhere s is the transformed variable and ( )K s  is the matrix of the LT of kernel derivative ( )C ?\ni\n\n. \n\nBy solving (3-24) for ( )H s , it follows that: \n\n( ) ( ) ( )\nT T T\n\nI K s H s A s? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? ? =? ?? ? ? ? ? ?? ?\n. (3-25)\n\nEq. (3-25) corresponds to a system of linear algebraic equations that can be \n\nsimultaneously solved by using any numerical solution method. The unknowns of (3-25) are \n\nthe values of ( )jh s  (with 1,...,j N= ) and will be used for computing ( )j s?  which comes up \n\nfrom applying LT to convolution integral equations given in (3-2) as follows: \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )0 *j j jjj s v s h s v s? ?= ? + , (3-26)\n\nwhere ( )jv s  is the LT of the term ( )\n0\n\nexp\nt\n\nj x dx?\n? ?\n? ??\n? ?\n? ?\n? . The values ( )j s?  represent the solution of \n\n(3-26) which can be independently solved for j=1,\u2026,N using the values ( )jh s  obtained from \n\n(3-25). \n\n\n\nChapter 3                                                                    Solving HSMP: 2N- and Lap- approaches \n\n 36\n\nGiven the solution of (3-26) (LT of the state probabilities for HSMP), the problem now \n\nconsists of inverting the LT to obtain the state probabilities on the time variable t. The \n\ninversion method on which the Lap-method is backed up will be described in next subsection. \n\n3.2.2. Numerical Inversion of Laplace Transforms: Gauss-Legendre based \nmethod \n\nThe numerical inversion of LT consists of obtaining estimates for f(t) given numerical \n\nvalues of the transform function \n~\n\n( )f s : \n\n( )\n0\n\n( ) ,stf s e f t dt\n?\n\n?= ?  (3-27)\n\nwhere s is the transformed variable. \n\nSome methods have been proposed in the literature to solve this problem such as Valk\u00f3 \n\nand Abate (2004), Abate and Valk\u00f3 (2004), Kryzhniy (2004), Milovanovic and Cvetkovic \n\n(2005) and Cuomo et al. (2007). \n\nThe numerical inversion method of LT presented here to compute the interval transition \n\nprobabilities of an HSMP is based on a Gaussian quadrature method known as Gauss \n\nLegendre (Bellman et al. (1966) and Abramowitz and Stegun (1972)). Recently, Oliveira et al. \n\n(2005) has applied a similar procedure to compute the state probabilities of non-homogeneous \n\nMP with supplementary variables. Great results attained on this situation have led to delve on \n\nthe feasibility of its application for solving HSMP as well, for which the dynamic behavior \n\nrise from a generalization of the Kolmogorov backward differential equations of the Markov \n\nenvironment. \n\nThus, making the change of variables z=exp(-t), eq. (3-27) reduces to a finite Mellin \n\ntransform (see Haidar (1997)): \n\n( ) ( )\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n( ln ) .sf s z f z dz?= ??  (3-28)\n\nThe integral of the right hand side of (3-28) can be approximated by a Gaussian \n\nQuadrature which involves the weighted sum of function ( )f ?  in the natural log of the \n\nabscissas zk provided, in this case, by the Gauss Legendre integration method. Thus, \n\n( ) ( )1\n1\n\n( ln ),\nM\n\ns\nk k k\n\nk\n\nf s w z f z?\n\n=\n\n= ??  (3-29)\n\nwhere kw  and kz  are the weights and abscissas, respectively, provided by the Gauss Legendre \n\nmethod. Note that wk and zk do not depend on the function ( )f ? , but only on the number M of \n\n\n\nChapter 3                                                                    Solving HSMP: 2N- and Lap- approaches \n\n 37\n\nquadrature points and on the integration interval. See Press et al. (2002) for further details on \n\nhow to obtain wk and zk by the Gauss Legendre method. \n\nAccording to Press et al. (2002), the idea of Gaussian quadrature is to provide the freedom \n\nto choose not only the weighting coefficients, but also the location of the abscissas at which \n\nthe function is to be evaluated: they are no longer equally spaced as occurs, for example, with \n\ntrapezoidal rule and Simpson method. \n\nRepresenting (3-29) in matrix form, it follows that: \n\n,??? = ?  (3-30)\n\nwhere ?  is M2-order matrix with 1vvk k kw z? ?=  and , 1,...,k M? = ; ?  is M-order matrix of the \n\nstate probabilities ( )lnj kz? ? ; ?  is M-order matrix of the LT of the state probabilities ( )j s? , \n\nwith 1,...,s M=  and j fixed. Given the transformed solution, eq. (3-30) is solved N times in \n\norder to obtain the state probabilities ( )lnj kz? ?  for j = 1...N by using any method of solution \n\nof linear algebraic equations such as Lower-Upper decomposition (see Press et al. (2002)). \n\nBefore solving eq. (3-30), (3-26) ( ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )0 *j j jjj s v s h s v s? ?= ? + ) is solved M runs in \n\norder to obtain the LT of the state probabilities ( )j s? , with 1,...,s M= . \n\nTheoretically, the bigger the number M of discretization points the greater results will be \n\nobtained. However, as we are using Gaussian Quadratures (rather than an equally spaced \n\ngeneral quadrature methods, such as Newton-Cotes or Simpson formulas, as holds for the 2N- \n\nand N2- approaches) one has more freedom in choosing the coefficients and abscissas at which \n\nthe function f will be evaluated thus, achieving integrations formulas of higher and higher \n\naccuracy with a smaller number of function evaluations than Newton-Cotes formula requires, \n\nfor example (see Press et al. (2002) for more details). \n\nIndeed, in accordance with a sensitivity analysis performed by Oliveira et al. (1997) one \n\nmay obtain reasonable great accuracies with a number M of discretization points equals to 16. \n\nAlthough these sensitivity tests have been taken on the Markov environment, one has \n\nconsiderable chances to reach the same findings here provided the semi-Markov processes are \n\nan extension of Markov models. \n\nAt this point, an important advantage of the Lap-numerical method comes up: whereas for \n\nthe 2N- and N2-approaches the number of discretization points should be increased to obtain \n\nimproved accuracies, the Lap-procedure with only 16 points will be able to provide valuable \n\nresults with less computational cost than the 2N- and N2-methods, as it will be showed \n\nthrough the examples in chapter 4. \n\n\n\nChapter 3                                                                    Solving HSMP: 2N- and Lap- approaches \n\n 38\n\nBefore that, notice that the numerical method as just described is only able to compute the \n\nstate probabilities ( )j? ?  at the points ln kt z= ? .

ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 2N- AND LAP- \nMETHODS FOR SOLVING HSMP \n\nThe present chapter focuses on scrutinizing the main findings of chapter 3, comparing the \n\neffectiveness in terms of computational time and accuracy of 2N- and Lap- approaches against \n\nthe results obtained through the N2- and MC methods by means of three examples in the \n\ncontext of availability assessment. \n\nAt first, 2N- and N2-approaches will be required for solving the homogeneous version of \n\nthe availability assessment problem of optical monitoring systems described in section 1.2.2. \n\nNext, 2N- and Lap-methods will solve the pumping oil unit problem given in section 1.2.1. \n\nFinally, the Lap-procedure will be also used in order to perform uncertainty analysis on the \n\navailability measure of the same pumping oil unit. \n\n4.1. Optical Monitoring System Case: A Comparison Between 2N- and N2-\napproaches \n\nIn section 1.2.2, it was mentioned that the OMS dynamics should be treated by NHSMP \n\ndue to the its peculiar characteristics. However, in this section let disregard the non-\n\nhomogeneous idiosyncrasy of that system in order to compare performances of the 2N- and \n\nN2-approaches designed for HSMP in treating the problem of predicting the OMS dynamic \n\nbehavior over time. \n\nGiven that the problem description is provided in 1.2.2, let\u2019s move on directly towards the \n\nrequired data for modeling. In fact, data needed to estimate the state probabilities and system \n\nunavailability for HSMP described through transition probabilities, such as OMS, are the \n\ntransition probabilities pij and the CDF Gij( ? ) as indicated in Figure 1-3. The probabilities p23 \n\nand p34 correspond to HEP that are assessed taking into consideration whether the \u201cavailable \n\ntime to complete the repair\u201d is adequate or not (see section 1.2.2). \n\nIn Droguett et al. (2008), these probabilities and their causal relationships with \n\nperformance shaping factors are handled through BBN (see Pearl (2000) and Korb and \n\nNicholson (2003) for further details on BBN). Due to the scarcity of failure data on the OMS \n\nperformance, the probabilities p23 and p34 (and their complements p21 and p31, respectively) \n\nwere obtained from engineering judgments (see Langseth and Portinale (2007) for further \n\ndetails on BBN in the reliability context). \n\nFor the sake of simplicity, the integration between HSMP and BBN is not considered here. \n\nTherefore, in this example it is assumed that the operator HEP corresponds to 0.18 when \n\nunder a situation of adequate available time to complete the repair, i.e., when the system \n\n\n\nChapter 4                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N- and Lap- for solving HSMP \n\n 40\n\nreaches state 2. When the system reaches state 3, the time window to complete the repair \n\nbecomes tighter, and it is assumed an HEP equals to 0.38 (these values are from Droguett et \n\nal. (2008) and may also be obtained through the CPT given in Appendix B). \n\nThe probability values pij as well as the CDF Gij(? ) of the HSMP are summarized in Table \n\n4-1. Note that none of the parameters given in Table 4-1 depends on the process time what \n\nimplies the non-homogeneity has not actually been considered. \n\nTable 4-1 \u2013 Parameter estimates of the HSMP: pij and Gij(t) for the OMS example \n\nTransition  Transition probabilities of the EHMP Conditional CDF \ni ? j pij Gij(t)\n1 ? 1 0.60 Exponential (1E-04h-1) \n1 ? 2 0.40 Weibull (500.0h, 1.35) \n2 ? 1 0.82 Exponential (0.05h-1) \n2 ? 3 0.18 Weibull (300.0h, 1.75) \n3 ? 1 0.62 Exponential (0.05h-1) \n3 ? 4 0.38 Lognormal (4.0h, (0.40)2h2) \n\nIt is now possible to estimate the state probabilities (eq. (3-2)) and the system \n\nunavailability by solving the 2N-numerical procedure described in chapter 3 (section 3.1), as \n\nshown in Figure 4-1 for a mission time of 1 year (8760 hours) and M = 2,500 steps for the 2N-\n\nmethod, as well as according to the N2-method described in Corradi et al. (2004) (with M = \n\n2,500) and to the MC simulation (with M = 2,500 and 100,000 samples). \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 4                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N- and Lap- for solving HSMP \n\n 41\n\n \n\nFigure 4-1 \u2013 State probabilities and unavailability curves for example 2 - 2N-method x N2 and Monte Carlo approaches: (a) \n1 ( )t? ; (b) 2 ( )t? ; (c) 3 ( )t? ; (d) 4 ( )t? ; (e) unavailability \n\nNote that the measures estimated by the 2N-method match the computed values obtained \n\nby the application of MC simulation as well as by the N2-solution. These results provide a \n\nvalidation of the accuracy of 2N-numerical treatment then. \n\nFurthermore, even though the simulation times depend on the computer settings, a \n\nconsiderable difference in terms of computational effort is verified in this example. Indeed, in \n\nan Intel\u00ae Core Dual Core Processor 32-bit Operating System, 2.00 GHz, 250.0 Gb and 2.00 \n\nGB of RAM1, the 2N-method required 27.56 seconds, whereas the MC and the N2 approaches \n\nspent 1,163.25 seconds and 40,551.05 seconds, respectively. \n\nThe difference in CPU time required by the N2 and MC methods and the 2N-approach \n\nunderlines the efficiency of the latter in quickly achieving meaningful results with accuracy \n\ncomparable to the N2-method. \n\n4.2. Pumping Oil Unit Case: A Comparison Between 2N- and Lap-approaches \n\nSince the 2N-method has obtained noteworthy results, this section aims comparing it \n\nagainst the Lap-procedure through the pumping oil unit case, which was described in section \n\n1.2.1 and may be modeled as an HSMP described by transition rates. \n\nThen, assume that system is initially in state 1, the failure (?) and repair (?) rates are \n\nconstant and equal to 3.5e-3 failure/h and 0.020 repair/h, respectively, and ? = 100h and ? = \n\n2.08. Conversely to section 1.2.1, notice that the uncertainty on MTTF value has not been \n\nconsidered here. The focus on uncertainty analysis will be switched back in next section. \n\nBy solving the state probabilities for this HSMP described by transition rates given in eq. \n\n(3-2), Figure 4-2 shows the outcomes provided by the Lap-procedure, 2N- and Monte Carlo \n\napproaches for a mission time of T = 500.0h. For sake of illustration, Figure 4-2 does not \n\n                                                 \n1 The same computer setting will be used for the next examples. \n\n\n\nChapter 4                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N- and Lap- for solving HSMP \n\n 42\n\ndepict the results attained by N2- since previous section already showed it and the 2N-\n\napproach show close agreement. \n\n \n(a) \n\n \n(b) \n\n \n(c) \n\nFigure 4-2 \u2013 State probabilities \u2013 Lap-method x 2N- and MC approaches: (a) 1 ( )t? ; (b) 2 ( )t? ; (c) 3 ( )t?  \n\nIn this example of application, the MC algorithm ran with 100,000 iterations and M = 500 \n\nsteps. For the 2N- and N2- methods, M = 500 steps were used. Note that in Figure 4-2, the \n\nstate probabilities computed by the Lap- and 2N- numerical procedures and by simulation \n\nshow close agreement, providing a validation of the Lap-technique in relation to its numerical \n\napproximation. \n\nFurthermore, the Lap-numerical technique has computed the state probabilities for this \n\nHSMP described by transition rates considerably faster than the 2N- and N2- and MC \n\napproaches. Indeed, the Lap-method spent less than one second (0.06 seconds), while the 2N-, \n\nN2- and MC approaches took 1.97, 1,317.12 and 64.10 seconds, respectively. \n\n4.3. Pumping Oil Unit: Availability Uncertainty Analysis Through Lap-method \n\nIn section 1.2.1, the pumping oil unit problem had been described considering the \n\nuncertainty on MTTF value which was influenced by external factors (see Figure 1-1). \n\nBasically, it is required that an HSMP-based numerical method runs several times in order to \n\n\n\nChapter 4                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N- and Lap- for solving HSMP \n\n 43\n\ncatch the impact of MTTF uncertainty on the (un)availability measure. Since the Lap-\n\nprocedure has showed meaningful outcomes in terms of computational time and accuracy as \n\nwell, it will be used to perform the availability uncertainty analysis in this section. \n\nFurthermore, it will be showed how to update probabilistic beliefs on availability curve as \n\nnew evidence becomes available. \n\n4.3.1. Availability Measure Estimation \n\nConsidering that the system starts its operation in state 1 (available), the availability is \n\nassessed for a mission time equals to T=1,000.0h. Considering also the relation ? = 1/MTTF, \n\n?: failure rate, the Lap-algorithm described in section 3.2 is replicated for 100,000 iterations \n\nin order to explicitly quantify the uncertainty on the availability measure given uncertainty in \n\nthe MTTF characterized in terms of the BBN in Figure 1-1. \n\nIndeed, Figure 4-3(a) shows the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile curves computed for \n\navailability by the Lap-numerical procedure. Each percentile corresponds to the probability \n\nthat the availability measure value is smaller than the computed one at a specific point in the \n\nmission time, thus explicitly quantifying the impact of the uncertainty about the parameter \n\nMTTF on availability measure. Figure 4-3(b) in turn illustrates the availability curves \n\ncomputed by both Lap-numerical method and MC simulation considering the prior1 mean \n\nvalue for 5246.98priorMTTF =  h. \n\n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 4-3 \u2013 Availability Measure Curve: (a) uncertainty on availability measure; (b) Proposed numerical procedure x Monte \nCarlo simulation \n\nIn this example, the MC algorithm for HSMP described in Moura and Droguett (2007) \n\n(which follows in attachment F) has run with M = 1,000 steps and 100,000 iterations for each \n\nstep. For the Lap-method, M = 16 steps was used as discussed in section 3.2. \n\n                                                 \n1 The term prior means CPT in Appendix A is directly used to estimate MTTF distribution. \n\n\n\nChapter 4                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N- and Lap- for solving HSMP \n\n 44\n\nNote that in Figure 4-3(b), the availability measure computed by both the Lap- and MC \n\nprocedures show close agreement, again providing a validation of the Lap-technique in \n\nrelation to its numerical approximation. \n\nMoreover, the Lap-method spent roughly 0.02 seconds per replication, while the MC took \n\n47.81 seconds to compute the results showed in Figure 4-3(b). \n\n4.3.2. Updating Probabilistic Beliefs \n\nThe hybrid (HSMP-BBN) model allows for uncertainty updating regarding the availability \n\nmeasure as new evidence about any of the external factors influencing MTTF (Figure 1-1) \n\nbecomes available at any point in the mission time. In fact, suppose it is known that the level \n\nof paraffin is inadequate for the oil to be handled by the pumping unit. This new evidence \n\ndoes not imply any changes in the BBN topology (Figure 1-1) or for the state diagram of the \n\nHSMP (Figure 1-2). However, the CPT of the BBN, which are given in Appendix A, are \n\nmodified as now it is known that P(Inadequate level of paraffin) = 1. \n\nThis new evidence impacts the future behavior of the system and consequently its \n\navailability measure. The uncertainty on system availability metric given the new evidence is \n\ncharacterized in terms of a posterior distribution whereas a prior distribution characterizes the \n\nuncertainty about availability metric before the evidence has become available as was done in \n\nprevious subsection.  \n\nUpdating the uncertainty distribution for the MTTF according to Firmino (2004), Figure \n\n4-4 shows the comparison between marginal prior and posterior probability distributions for \n\nthe MTTF. The results show that because of the inadequate paraffin level there is a shift of \n\nprobability mass towards lower values of MTTF. \n \n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n100 200 1000 10000\n\nMTTF (h)\n\nP\nro\n\nba\nbi\n\nlit\ny\n\nPrior\nPosterior\n\n \nFigure 4-4 \u2013 Prior and posterior marginal probability distributions of MTTF \n\nConsidering the posterior mean value for MTTF,  2800.0posteriorMTTF = h, Figure 4-5 \n\nillustrates the impact on the availability uncertainty given the updated MTTF probability \n\ndistribution.

Moreover, \n\nuncertainty on other reliability measures such as reliability and maintainability could be \n\nassessed from the proposed hybrid model (see Moura (2006) and Moura and Droguett \n\n(2008)). \n\n4.4. Comments \n\nContinuous-time homogeneous semi-Markov processes are important probabilistic tools to \n\nmodel reliability measures for systems whose future behavior is dependent on the current and \n\nnext states of the process as well as on sojourn times, as for fault tolerant systems where the \n\nfailure of a component leads to a system failure only when repair time has exceeded some \n\ntolerable downtime, i.e., component failure does not immediately cause a system failure. \n\n\n\nChapter 4                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N- and Lap- for solving HSMP \n\n 46\n\nHSMP were usually computed via the N2-method described in Corradi et al. (2004) where \n\nthe future behavior of the system is assessed via interval transition probability equations \n\ncomprised of a set of N2 coupled integral equations with one time variable t. However, this \n\napproach is rather time-consuming with a computational cost greater than the MC simulation. \n\nThis situation motivated the search for more efficient numerical treatments of HSMP with \n\nless computational effort and with a comparable accuracy in relation to the available methods \n\nin the related literature (MC simulation and the N2-approach). \n\nIn fact, the 2N-mathematical formulation and numerical treatment consists of casting the \n\nN2 coupled convolution integral equations into an initial value problem involving transition \n\nfrequency densities, and then solve N coupled integral equations with one variable and N \n\nstraightforward integrations.  \n\nMoreover, this thesis has proposed the alternative Lap-method which makes use of LT. \n\nAlthough using Laplace apparatus on HSMP field is not novel, the Lap-procedure showed \n\nsome noteworthy advantages: (i) it used a pre-set number of steps, which is independent on \n\nthe problem to be solved. Thus, it is not required anymore adjusting (through either trial-error \n\ntests or dynamically) the number M of steps in order to attain the desired convergence. (ii) \n\nthus, it reduced considerably the computational effort in relation to the abovementioned 2N- \n\nand N2-methods and MC as well. The Lap-approach was also validated by comparison with \n\nthe results from both the 2N- and N2-solutions and MC method.  \n\nOne drawback that deserves attention is since Lap-method is backed up on Gaussian \n\nQuadratures theory there is not a quite simple way to obtain an estimate of the absolute error \n\nmade by the approach (see Press et al. (2002) for more details). Moreover, unfortunately, the \n\napplication of the Lap-procedure within the non-homogeneous environment has not catched \n\nnotable outcomes, as showed in Moura and Droguett (2007). \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 5                                                                                    2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 47\n\n5. 2N-METHOD FOR NON-HOMOGENEOUS SEMI-MARKOV \nPROCESSES \n\nNon-homogeneity implies higher difficulties on the continuous-time semi-Markov \n\nprocesses (NHSMP) environment. This gives rise as more intricate mathematical methods and \n\nrelated numerical solutions and is one of the main reasons behind the scarcity of NHSMP \n\napplications.  \n\nIndeed, the N2-method for solving NHSMP is rather burdensome (as it has already been \n\nseen for HSMP case in chapter 3), consisting of directly applying a general quadrature method \n\nto N2 coupled integral equations with two variables, where N is the number of states. \n\nTherefore, the next two chapters focus on developing a new and faster numerical treatment, \n\nwhich is also called 2N-method, for NHSMP and scrutinizing its effectiveness comparing \n\nagainst the results provided by the N2- method and MC. Rather than computing N2 integral \n\nequations, this approach consists of solving only N coupled integral equations with one \n\nvariable and N straightforward integrations so that the high and inherent computational cost \n\nthat plagues the solution of NHSMP is likely to be reduced. \n\nThe main findings within this chapter can be found in Moura and Droguett (2009c), which \n\nfollows in attachment G. As the homogenous counterpart may be considered a special case of \n\nNHSMP, the conclusions made over the present chapter may be specialized for the \n\ndevelopments showed in chapter 3 (section 3.1). In spite of that, it was quite meaningful \n\ndeveloping a particular 2N-mathematical and numerical formulations for HSMP since in this \n\nway its peculiar characteristics have been taken into account. \n\n5.1. An initial value problem for NHSMP involving transition frequency \ndensities \n\nDepending on how an NHSMP is described, the kernel Cij( ? ) and the CDF Fi(? ) are given \n\nby equations (2-8) and (2-9) in case of transition probabilities or by equations (2-13) and \n\n(2-14) in case of transition rates. The 2N-numerical approach will be developed in a general \n\nway in order to handle both situations. \n\nBy using a similar nomenclature to the one in Becker et al. (2000), let recall N(t) to be the \n\nnumber of times that state j of an NHSMP is visited from any state in the interval [0,t]. Let \n\nalso Hj(t) = E[N(t)] be its expected value. If Hj(t) is continuously differentiable, then hj(t)dt = \n\ndHj(t) is its corresponding density function. \n\n\n\nChapter 5                                                                                    2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 48\n\nAs the stochastic process under consideration is regular, i.e., no more than one transition \n\ncan occur in any interval (t, t+dt), then hj(t) can be assumed as the probability that a transition \n\noccurs to state j in an infinitesimal time interval dt as follows: \n\nhj(t)dt=Pr{to reach state j in (t, t+dt)}.  \n\nThus, it follows that: \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )\n1 1 0\n\n0 (0, ) , .\ntN N\n\nijj i ij i\ni i\n\nh t C t h C t d? ? ? ?\n= =\n\n= ? + ?? ??\ni i\n\n (5-1)\n\nAccording to the description of eq. (2-8), (5-1) means state j can be reached either if the \n\nprocess was initially in state i and remains there until time t, when a transition to state j \n\noccurs; or if the process reached state i at time ?, remaining there for x = t ? ?, then a \n\ntransition to state j occurs. The summation over the state number N is for all possible \n\nintermediary states, where NHSMP can transit. The integral term in turn means that the \n\ntransition to state i may occur at any time ? ? [0,t]. \n\nEq. (5-1) corresponds to a system of N integral equations with unknowns hj(t), j = 1,\u2026,N. \n\nThe probabilities ?j(t)=Pr[Zt=j | Z0] can be obtained from the initial conditions ?j(0) as \n\nfollows: \n\n( ) ( ) ( )\n0\n\n0 [1 (0, )] [1 ( , )]\nt\n\nj j j j jt F t h F t d? ? ? ? ?= ? ? + ? ?? . (5-2)\n\nEq. (5-2) says that a process can be in state j at time t either if it was initially in the state j \n\nand remained there at least up to time t; or if it visited state j at any time ? ? [0,t] with \n\nprobability hj(t) and stayed there for (x = t ? ?). Eq. (5-2) corresponds to N straightforward \n\nintegrations that can be solved independently by using the solution of equation (5-1). \n\nEqs. (5-1) and (5-2) extend the formulation presented in Becker et al. (2000) in order to \n\naddress NHSMP described in terms of both transition probabilities and transition rates. \n\nMoreover, the computational effort to solve eqs. (5-1) and (5-2) is less intricate than in the \n\ncase of the N2-method described in Janssen and Manca (2001). In fact, the 2N-method consists \n\nof solving N coupled integral equations with one variable (eq. (5-1)) and N straightforward \n\nintegrations (eq. (5-2)) whereas the N2-method consists of solving N2 coupled integral \n\nequations (eq. (2-10)). A comparison among the 2N-approach, the N2-method and the MC-\n\nbased solution will be discussed in chapter 6.  \n\nBefore that in next section, a general quadrature based method for simultaneously solving \n\nthe eqs. (5-1) and (5-2) will be presented. Moreover, the convergence conditions and error \n\nanalysis are also developed and demonstrated. \n\n\n\nChapter 5                                                                                    2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 49\n\n5.2.

Moreover, one has M such that Mh T= , with 0 kh T? ? , \n\n, ,k M k M? ?  where M is the number of steps and T is the mission time. \n\nUsing eq.

Eq. (5-9) is \n\nused to compute the N-order matrices ( )\nT\n\nhH ? , whose elements ( )jh h?  are the density functions \n\nof the number of times that state 1,...,j N=  of an NHSMP is visited from any state in the \n\ninterval [0,?h].  \n\nBasically, eq. (5-9) represents the main difference between the 2N- and N2-approaches. \n\nWhile 2N-method needs to solve eq. (5-9) (set of N linear algebraic equations) M times as a \n\nrequirement to catch the system\u2019s dynamic behavior over time, N2-method computes the \n\ninterval transition probabilities by using a somewhat modified formula which possesses a \n\nmain difference in relation to that equation: the solution of the N2-counterpart for eq. (5-9) is \n\ncomposed of an M2-order matrix of matrices which in turn are of order N2. Thus, through N2-\n\nmethod the number of each set of N2 linear equations to be solved is equal to (M2+M)/2. In \n\nthis way, 2N-method tends to reduce considerably the computational time in relation to N2-\n\nmethod. \n\nHaving estimated the solutions matrix TH  (eq. (5-9)), the next step consists in computing \n\nthe N state probabilities ( )j t? . In fact, a numerical solution for the state probabilities ( )j t?  \n\ncan be computed as follows: \n\n( ) ( ) ( ),\n0\n\n0 [1 (0 , )] [1 ( , )]\nk\n\njj j k jj kh h F h kh w h h F h kh?\n?\n\n? ? ? ?\n=\n\n= ? ? + ? ? ?? , (5-10)\n\n\n\nChapter 5                                                                                    2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 51\n\nwhere ( )jh h?

In this \n\nway, ( ) ( ) ( )0 ,..., ,...,h h Mh?? ?= ? ? ?? ??  is comprised of M matrices ( )h??  each one of order N.  \n\nNote that, rather than solving the N2 coupled integral equations with two variables through \n\nthe direct application of any general quadrature method to eq. (2-10), the approach just \n\ndescribed estimates the state probabilities of an NHSMP by solving N coupled integral \n\nequations with one variable (eq. (5-9)) and N straightforward integrations (eq. (5-10)). \n\nFor example, by using the extended Simpson\u2019s rule given in Press et al. (2002) (p. 138), \n\neqs.

(5-18) computes the upper limit of the discretization error estimate whenever ( )jh kh  is \n\nused to approximate ( )jh kh . The same conclusion was reached in Janssen and Manca (2001) \n\nfor the N2-method. In other words, the upper limit of the numerical error computed by \n\nestimating the interval transition probabilities by using the N2-method is the same given by eq. \n\n(5-18). \n\nGiven the solution of eq. (5-4), the error estimate ( ) ( )( )kj jjh kh kh? ? ?= ?  in computing ( )j t?  \n\nthrough eq. (5-10) in turn depends only on the choice of the quadrature method since each \n\nunknown may be solved independtly. In eq. (5-11), for example, the error term is equal to \n\n( )4( ) 1/kj jh O k? = . This means the true answer ( )j kh?  differs from the estimate ( )j kh?  by an \namount equals to 41/ k  (see Press et al. (2002) for further details). \n\nTherefore, the upper limit of the total error estimate of the 2N-method is given by the sum \n\nof the discretization errors estimated from eqs. (5-1) and (5-2). In spite of that, as eq. (5-18) is \n\nan inequality it is even possible that the 2N-method catches smaller errors than N2-method. \n\nIn this way, it is expected that the 2N-method be less time-consuming since it involves \n\nsolving N coupled integral equations and N straightforward integrations. Moreover, generally \n\nspeaking it has accuracy roughly equals to the N2-method. However, it is also possible that the \n\n2N-method obtains minor errors than N2-method. Research on these findings will be done in \n\nnext chapter. \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 56\n\n6. ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 2N-METHOD FOR \nSOLVING NHSMP \n\nTwo examples in the context of reliability are presented in this chapter. The first one \n\naddresses a case where a semi-analytical solution is available. Then it is discussed an example \n\nof application concerning the pressure-temperature optical monitoring systems for oil wells \n\npreviously described in section 1.2.2. In both cases, the 2N-approach is validated via the \n\ncomparison against the results obtained from the semi-analytical solution (for the first \n\nexample) as well as from both the N2- and the MC methods. \n\n6.1. A semi-analytical example \n\nThis section handles a simple three-state reliability semi-Markov example for a system \n\ncomprised of a single component as illustrated in Figure 6-1. This system starts its operation \n\nin state 1. From there, it moves to state 2 if it reaches a determined non-critical degradation \n\nstage. If degradation level of the component attains a critical threshold, the system fails (state \n\n3). \n\n \nFigure 6-1 \u2013 HSMP for the semi-analytical example \n\nThis semi-Markov process is homogeneous in relation to the process time and, for this \n\nsituation, a semi-analytical solution is possible as follows: \n\n1 1( ) 1 (0, )t F t? = ? ,  \n\n122 2\n0\n\n( ) (0, ) [1 ( , )]\nt\n\nt C F t d? ? ? ?= ? ??\ni\n\n, \n \n\n3 1 2( ) 1 [ ( ) ( )]t t t? ? ?= ? + .  \n\nThe solution is considered semi-analytical as the state probability 1 ( )t?  can be analytically \n\nestimated, while the state probability 2 ( )t? is computed via numerical integration.  \n\nThe required data to estimate the system reliability is given in Table 6-1. For the sake of \n\nvalidation, the results provided by the semi-analytical solution are compared against the ones \n\nfrom the 2N-method, the N2-approach, and the MC simulation drawn for NHSMP. \n\nTable 6-1 \u2013 Parameters of the NHSMP: pij(t) and Gij(l,t) for the semi-analytical example. \n\nTransition  Transition probabilities of the ENHMP Conditional CDF  \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 57\n\ni ? j pij Gij(l,t)\n1 ? 2 1.0 Exponential (1e-3h-1) \n2 ? 3 1.0 Weibull (250.0h, 1.5) \n\nSupposing that the system is functioning when in states 1 and 2, the system reliability is \n\nshown in Figure 6-2 for a mission time equals to 4,500.0 hours, M = 1,500 steps for the N2- \n\nand 2N-approaches, and 100,000 samples for the Monte Carlo simulation. \n\n \nFigure 6-2 \u2013 Reliability for the semi-analytical example: mission time of 4,500 hours and M = 1500 steps. \n\nNote that the reliability estimated by the 2N-mathematical formulation and numerical \n\ntreatment matches the computed values via the semi-analytical solution, as it also does for the \n\nMC and the N2-solutions, thus providing a validation of the 2N-model, with its numerical \n\napproximation. \n\nAnother important aspect to be considered is the computational effort involved in the three \n\nsolution methods. Actually, the 2N-approach with its numerical treatment computes the \n\nsystem reliability considerably faster than both MC simulation and N2-method. Indeed, the \n\n2N-method spent 2.44 seconds, while the Monte Carlo took 133.56 seconds, and the N2- \n\nrequired 2,442.19 seconds. \n\nIn the next section, it is discussed a more complex example of application in the context of \n\ntemperature-pressure optical monitoring systems in oil industry. \n\n6.2. Example of application: availability of downhole optical monitoring \nsystems \n\nThe present section focuses on scrutinizing the main findings on the 2N-method drawn for \n\nNHSMP on continuous-time. \n\nFor validation purposes, the solution provided by the 2N-mathematical and numerical \n\napproaches will again be compared to the N2-method given in Janssen and Manca (2001) and \n\nthe MC simulation by means of an example in the context of reliability assessment of \n\ntemperature-pressure optical monitoring systems for downhole applications in the oil industry. \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 58\n\nThe explanation of this application comes from the example 2 given in subsection 1.2.2. \n\nProvided that description, the focus will switch towards the data required for analyzing over \n\ntime the availability of the optical monitoring system. \n\n6.2.1. Required data \n\nOptical Monitoring Systems are installed as part of intelligent completions in onshore oil \n\nwells. Each well is comprised of three production zones. Thus, a monitoring system is \n\ncomprised of four pressure-temperature sensors, one for each zone plus one sensor for \n\nmonitoring the artificial elevation system (oil pumping). All sensors are on the same optical \n\ncable. \n\nProvided the lack of operational experience on these systems some simplifying \n\nassumptions are made. Indeed, although an OMS is comprised of several components (e.g., \n\noptical cable, sensor unit, jumpers, cable-cable and cable-sensor connections) as shown in \n\nFigure 6-3, the availability modeling is developed at the system level. Moreover, the \n\nreinstallation typically involves the repairman who runs the OMS downhole as well as a \n\nsupervisor. The HEP is, however, modeled and quantified only for the repairman. \n\nTherefore, and in light of these limitations, it aims to develop a model based on the \n\ncombination of continuous-time SMP and BBN that is able to handle over time the joint \n\nimpact of the tolerable downtime and process time as well as the human performance on the \n\nOMS availability during the execution of reinstallation activities. \n\n \n\nFigure 6-3 - Intelligent well with a pressure-temperature OMS \n\nSpectral analysis of the limited OMS units that have been deployed has been used for \n\ngaining knowledge regarding OMS time to failure pattern. Figure 6-4 and Figure 6-5 show the \n\nspectral analysis for an OMS when it was installed and 20 months later, respectively. \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 59\n\nEach sensor in the OMS is represented by a double optical power peak, where the left and \n\nright ones correspond to pressure and temperature, respectively. Thus, Figure 6-4 and Figure \n\n6-5 have four pairs of peak corresponding to the four sensors in the OMS. If the optical power \n\nof one peak in relation to the others in the spectrum is small, then peaks are interpreted as \n\nnoise, resulting in the loss of the monitoring capability. \n\nAs seen in Figure 6-4 and Figure 6-5, the spectral analysis has indicated a gradual \n\nattenuation of the optical power from the sensors, and it is more significant for the bottom \n\nsensor (indicated by a red contour). \n\n \nFigure 6-4 \u2013 Spectral analysis for OMS at installation \n\nThese results have led to the conclusion that the OMS units are under a deterioration \n\nprocess what, along with the tolerable downtime characteristics, justifies the use of an \n\nNHSMP. This process eventually leads to the complete loss of the signal, as shown in Figure \n\n6-6 for the first two sensors from the well bottom after just 22 months from the installation \n\ndate. \n\n \nFigure 6-5 \u2013 Spectral analysis for OMS after 20 months of installation \n\nThe semi-Markov process is therefore considered as non-homogeneous so that this \n\ndeterioration process may be adequately addressed. Therefore, the required data to estimate \n\nthe system availability via this NHSMP model are the parameters pij( ? ) and Gij( ? , ? ) of the \n\nNHSMP in Figure 1-3, through which the kernel Cij( ? , ? ) can also be found. \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 60\n\n \n\nFigure 6-6 \u2013 Spectral analysis for OMS after 22 months of installation \n\nTable 6-2 summarizes the requisite data for solving the NHSMP given in Figure 1-3. \n\nLooking at that, it can be seen probabilities p11(t) and p12(t) depend on the process time t, \n\nreflecting the deteriorating process to which the OMS is subjected. The probability p12(t) of \n\nleaving state 1 to state 2 is set to value 0.4 at t0 = 0, increasing continuously in the interval of \n\n15,000h. The probability p11(t) in turn decreases from 0.6 during the same interval. \nTable 6-2 \u2013 Estimates of parameters of the NHSMP. \n\ni ? j pij(t) Gij(l,t)\n1 ? 1 (-0.00004 t) + 0.6 Exponential(1E-04h-1) \n1 ? 2 (0.00004 t) + 0.4 Weibull(270.0h, 1.86) \n2 ? 1 0.82 Exponential(0.0208h-1) \n2 ? 3 0.18 LogNormal(4.0h, (0.4h)2) \n3 ? 1 0.62 Exponential(0.0416 h-1) \n3 ? 4 0.38 LogNormal(2.5h,(0.25h)2) \n\nIndeed, 2N-method for NHSMP described in chapter 4 will be used for solving the \n\nNHSMP of Figure 1-3. In next subsection, the main findings on 2N-method will be analyzed \n\ncomparing its effectiveness, in terms of accuracy and computational time, with the results \n\nprovided by N2-method and MC simulation. \n\n6.2.2. Results \n\nIn fact, for different number M of steps, from Figure 6-7 to Figure 6-10 there will be \n\nshowed the estimated OMS availability (A(t) = 1 ( )t? ) for a mission time of T = 1 year (8,760 \n\nhours) according to the 2N- and N2-methods and to MC simulation (100,000 samples). The \n\nmain findings of this subsection are provided in Moura and Droguett (2009a), which follows \n\nin attachment H. \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 61\n\n0.88\n\n0.93\n\n0.98\n\n1.03\n\n1.08\n\n1.13\n\n1.18\n\n0 2000 4000 6000 8000\n\nA\n(t\n)\n\nT(h)\n\nMC?method\u00a0(1,500\u00a0steps)\n\n2N?method\u00a0(100\u00a0steps)\n\nN2?method\u00a0(100\u00a0steps)\n\nFigure 6-7 \u2013 OMS availability: mission time of 8,760 hours and M = 100 steps \n\nIn Figure 6-7, neither 2N- nor N2- show close agreement when compared to the MC \n\nsolution.

Because of this, the y-axis \n\ncould have be quoted as reliability rather than availability, not reaching a steady state; (ii) it is \n\nobserved a local minimum at the beginning of the mission. This behavior is somewhat a result \n\nof the deteriorating process under which the system is subjected when it occupies state 1. \n\nThen, it may be seen an increase in the system reliability as the failure/reinstallation cycles \n\nstart (process reaches states 2 and 3). \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 63\n\nLetting the illustrated analysis aside, we may make use of the cross-entropy measure (see \n\nKullback and Leibler (1951) for more details) for analyzing how the discrepancy among the \n\n2N-, N2- and MC-methods varies as a function of the number M of steps.

Generally speaking, it underpins the discussion made in section 5.2.2 \n\non the upper limit of the discretization error estimate for NHSMP. In fact, even though the \n\n2N-method is faster it presents an error estimate smaller than N2-method over the number M \n\nof steps and that tends to zero as M increases. The latter characteristic holds for the N2-method \n\nas well. \n\n?10\n\n190\n\n390\n\n590\n\n790\n\n990\n\n1190\n\n1390\n\n1590\n\n1790\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n\nC\nR\nO\nS\nS\n\n?\nE\nN\nT\nR\n\nO\nP\nY\n\nNumber\u00a0M\u00a0\u00a0of\u00a0steps\n\nA(t)\n\nN2?Cross\u00a0Entropy\n\n2N?Cross\u00a0Entropy\n\n \nFigure 6-11 \u2013 Cross-entropy over number of steps: 2N- x N2- \n\nFigure 6-11 also depicts that the findings given in section 3.1.2.2 on the accuracy of the \n\n2N-method for HSMP are somewhat conservative. In that occasion, it has been concluded the \n\n2N-discretization error would be greater or equal to N2-error. However, in section 3.1.2.2 the \n\ninequality in eq. (3-19) was disregarded what implies the results from Figure 6-11 also holds \n\nfor HSMP. \n\nBesides validating the 2N-method accuracy in comparison with the results of the N2- and \n\nMC approaches, other criteria to contrast these different solutions for NHSMP is the time to \n\nconverge, i.e., computational cost. \n\nIndeed, by using the 2N-approach it is only needed solving N coupled integral equations \n\nwith one variable and N straightforward integrations, rather than computing N2 integral \n\nequations as through the N2-method. Indeed for M = 1,500 steps, the 2N-method spent 7.10 \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 64\n\nseconds, whereas the MC took 246.43 seconds, and the N2-approach required 8,370.24 \n\nseconds.

Obviously, one must scrutinize these outcomes in order to find whether they \n\ncorrespond to a general consequence or not. \n\n6.3. Comments \n\n6.3.1. 2N-method \n\nNHSMP were usually computed via the N2-method described in Janssen and Manca \n\n(2001) where the future behavior of the system is assessed via interval transition probability \n\nequations comprised of a system of N2 coupled integral equations with two variables, with N \n\nthe number of states. However, this approach is rather cumbersome. \n\nThis situation motivated the development of a more efficient formulation for NHSMP that \n\nhad less computational effort, but kept the accuracy in relation to the available methods in the \n\nrelated literature, that is, MC simulation and the N2-approach. In fact, the proposed 2N-\n\nmathematical formulation and numerical treatment consists of casting the N2 coupled integral \n\nequations into an initial value problem involving transition frequency densities, and then solve \n\nN coupled integral equations with one variable and N straightforward integrations. This \n\napproach possesses the two aforementioned meaningful features: it is significantly less time-\n\nconsuming and has accuracy equals to the N2-method, as it was proved in section 5.2.2. \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 65\n\nThe 2N-mathematical formulation and numerical approach were also illustrated by means \n\nof two examples of application in the context of reliability and availability assessment, where \n\nthe effectiveness and the required computational effort of the 2N-method were also compared \n\nagainst the MC and the N2-approaches. From these examples, it was verified that the proposed \n\napproach is considerable faster than both the MC simulation and the N2-method. Specifically \n\non the second example, 2N-approach reaches greater accuracy than N2-method validating the \n\nfindings in section 5.2.2 on the behavior of the upper limit of the discretization error. \n\n6.3.2. OMS availability assessment \n\nThe availability analysis of an OMS is a complex subject. It is influenced by failure \n\npatterns of components that are usually under deteriorating processes. Maintenance also poses \n\nits own challenges, the most relevant ones being the human performance during \n\nreinstallations, and the impact of available time to complete the reinstallation on the human \n\nerror probability. And the availability assessment must be carried out with high level of \n\nuncertainty as a result of the paucity of relevant empirical information. \n\nIn this context, section 6.2 has provided an availability model for pressure-temperature \n\noptical monitoring systems. The model is based on the integration between non-homogeneous \n\ncontinuous time semi-Markov processes and Bayesian belief networks. NHSMP portion is \n\nresponsible for handling the OMS dynamics, and BBN are used to qualitatively and \n\nquantitatively model the cause-effect relationships among factors influencing the repairman \n\nerror probability during reinstallations. The model has also been applied to the analysis of an \n\nOMS in an onshore oil well in the Northeast of Brazil. \n\nWith this model we only scratched the surface of the problem. Although we do not \n\nprovide conclusive results from the application of the model to a real case situation, the \n\navailability model tackled the most relevant issues concerning the operation and maintenance \n\ncharacteristics of the system, providing the analysts with much needed flexibility for \n\nevaluating the availability of the system, as it was demonstrated in the example of application. \n\nIn the following we provide more specific comments on the limitations of the proposed \n\navailability model and discuss some alternative modeling approaches. (i) Given the lack of \n\ndata on the failure processes, the availability analysis was done at the system level. Although \n\nthe spectral analysis indicated that the optical monitoring system is under deterioration, the \n\navailability engineers and certainly the development process of the system will benefit from a \n\ndisaggregated availability analysis (at component level). This might be done by including a \n\nFault Tree sub-model which considers the combinations of component failure events leading \n\n\n\nChapter 6                                      Assessing the Effectiveness: 2N-Method for solving NHSMP \n\n 66\n\nthe system to change its general state. This and failure data gathering and analysis from the \n\ndeployed units (7 production and 1 injection wells have been recently equipped with the \n\nmonitoring system) are part of the next stage of this research. (ii) The construction of the BBN \n\nmodel for the human error probability and the population of the table of conditional \n\nprobabilities were based on expert opinion elicitation. Although all nodes were binaries, the \n\nexpert had difficulties in providing quantitative assessments especially for the non-root nodes. \n\nAs one of the next steps of this research, empirical data on at least some of the factors will be \n\ncollected so to relief the cognitive burden on an expert. So from this and the previous step, \n\none might get more reliable availability assessments. (iii) In the proposed model, the available \n\ntime to complete a reinstallation is obtained from the sojourn time in an unavailable state. \n\nAlthough the semi-Markovian process is continuous in time, this information is passed as \n\ndiscrete (binary) evidence to the node \u201cavailable time to complete the reinstallation\u201d of the \n\nBBN model for the human error probability. In the next stage of this research, this node is \n\ntreated as continuous. Thus, the use of hybrid BBN is a must and the iterative algorithm \n\nproposed by Neil et al. (2008) is currently being tested in the context of application of this \n\nwork. (iv) Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) have been used in the area of dependability \n\nanalysis, for example, Boudali and Dugan (2005), Weber et al. (2004) and Montani et al. \n\n(2008). However, at best of our knowledge, DBN-based approaches have been limited to deal \n\nwith representations of homogeneous and non-homogeneous Markov processes mostly in \n\ndiscrete time ((Boudali and Dugan (2006) propose a continuous time based DBN framework \n\nfor the analysis of dynamic fault trees), and with focus on non-repairable systems. However, \n\nDBN are an alternative approach to the availability assessment of the type of system analyzed \n\nin this research, and representation of semi-Markovian processes and repairable systems in a \n\nDBN framework are subjects of current research by the author. \n\n \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 67\n\n7. FURTHER EXAMPLES AND COMMENTS \n\nIn this chapter two further examples will be discussed. The first one shows how the 2N-\n\nmethod may be used for determining a maintenance optimization policy so that to maximize \n\nthe mean availability measure. The second example is also inserted into the optimization \n\ncontext. Basically, it is designed for determining which maintenance decisions should be \n\nmade so that the mean availability and expected costs are jointly optimized over the system\u2019s \n\nage. Thus, the Lap-method will be used to estimate the mean availability in this framework. \n\nBasically, these examples will be described as an attempt to show how reliability \n\nproblems, which would become infeasible due to the lack of an efficient method for solving \n\nNHSMP, may be modeled by using the proposed mathematical and numerical approaches. \n\n7.1. System Availability Optimization \n\nSystem availability optimization is one of the main issues to production managers: the \n\ngreater the system availability the greater the production profits are. Provided that each \n\npreventive maintenance action promotes a rejuvenation impact on the availability measure, \n\nthis section develops an approach to maximize the mean availability by identifying an optimal \n\nmaintenance policy for a hypothetical system, which is modeled according to a non-\n\nhomogeneous semi-Markov processes. \n\nIn order to solve the resulting optimization problem constrained by system performance \n\ncosts, genetic algorithms (GA) operators will be used (see Marseguerra et al. (2006) for \n\ngreater details on GA). The developments of this section are widely described in Moura et al. \n\n(2008), which follows in attachment I. \n\n7.1.1. Description of the problem \n\nConsider a system, which due to the same reasons discussed throughout the two last \n\nchapters, may be modeled through an NHSMP. Then, it is aimed establishing a preventive \n\nmaintenance policy that maximizes the system\u2019s mean availability restricted to technological \n\nand cost constraints. \n\nThis optimal policy is comprised of operating times tj up to the preventive action jth, which \n\nhas a rejuvenation impact q on the real age of the system. The parameter is incorporated into \n\nthe state equations of an NHSMP so that the effectiveness of each preventive maintenance is \n\ntaken into account in the optimization procedure of the mean system availability. \n\nThe mathematical programming problem relevant to the system is summarized as follows: \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 68\n\nMax A [T | (t1, t2, \u2026, tn); q] (7-1)\n\ns.t.

(7-2)]. Finally, K is a maximal cost \n\nconstraint, i.e., the total cost incurred by performing corrective and preventive maintenance \n\nactions. \n\n( )\n( )\n\n1\n\n1\n\nC T| ,..., ; ; ;\n\n,..., ;\n\nn p c\n\np p n p c\n\nt t q c c\n\nn c T T T A t t q T c\n\n? ? =? ?\n? ?? ?? ? + ? ? ? ?? ?? ?\n\n (7-2)\n\nTo achieve the optimal maintenance policy, GA are introduced to the problem. Basically, \n\nGA consider a population of individuals, where each individual is a possible solution to the \n\nproblem. In this context, genetic operators such as crossover and mutation are \n\ncomputationally mimicked in order to simulate the evolution process (see Michalewicz (1996) \n\nfor more details). \n\n7.1.2. Casting Maintenance Effectiveness into NHSMP \n\nIn order to take into account the effectiveness q of each maintenance action, let rewrite the \n\neqs. (5-1) and (5-2). Thus, the future behavior of an NHSMP over time may now be assessed \n\nthrough its state probabilities ?j(t)=Pr[Zt=j | Z0] given by as follows: \n\n( ) ( )\n\n( )\n0\n\n0 [1 (0, )]\n\n[1 ( , )] ( )\n\nj j j\nt\n\nj j\n\nt F qt\n\nh q F q qt d\n\n? ?\n\n? ? ?\n\n= ? ?\n\n+ ? ??\n (7-3)\n\nwhere Fj(l,t) and hj(t) are defined in chapters 2 and 6 respectively. Thus, it follows that: \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 69\n\n( ) ( )\n\n( ) ( )\n\n1\n\n1 0\n\n0 (0, )\n\n,\n\nN\n\nj i ij\ni\n\ntN\n\niji\ni\n\nh t C qt\n\nh q C q qt d\n\n?\n\n? ? ?\n\n=\n\n=\n\n= ?\n\n+ ?\n\n?\n\n??\n\ni\n\ni\n (7-4)\n\nwhere ( , )ijC\ni\ni i  is also defined in chapter 2. \n\nEq. (7-3) and (7-4) are modified versions of  (5-1) and (5-2) respectively, keeping the \n\nsame meaning as the latter though. In fact, backed up the virtual age model called General \n\nRenewal Process proposed by Kijima and Sumita (1986), the parameter q is introduced in \n\norder to measure the effectiveness of maintenance actions. In other words, the parameter q is \n\nused to handle the rejuvenation imposed to the system after the last maintenance event. \n\nIn accordance with q, a maintenance action can recover the system to some of the possible \n\nstates: (i) q = 0 \u2013 as good as new (perfect repair); (ii) q = 1 \u2013 as bad as old (minimal repair); \n\n(iii) 0 &lt;q &lt;1 - better than old but worse than new (imperfect repair). The impact of these \n\ntypes of maintenance on the system\u2019s availability is illustrated in Figure 7-1. \n\nAccording to Figure 7-1, it can be noticed that up to the first maintenance action there is \n\nno difference among the three types of repair analyzed. However, just after the first \n\nintervention the impact q of each maintenance action on system availability may be assessed. \n\nMoreover, Figure 7-1 illustrates that while the system is unavailable and under preventive \n\nmaintenance the instantaneous availability is zero. For further details on the classical and \n\nBayesian procedures for estimation of the parameter q see Ya\u00f1ez et al. (2002). \n\n \n\nFigure 7-1 \u2013 Impact of different types of repair on the availability \n\nThe model developed here proposes a preventive maintenance policy that maximizes the \n\nmean availability of a system which is estimated according to an NHSMP by considering the \n\nimpact q of each maintenance action on the system performance. Therefore, the objective \n\nfunction presented in (7-1) is the mean availability given by (7-5), where {A} is the set of \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 70\n\nstates in which the system is available.

(7-5)\n\n7.1.3. Example \n\nIt is assumed that a hypothetical system starts in normal operation in state 1. Over time, \n\ndue to operational and/or environmental conditions, the system may operate in a degraded \n\nstate even though it is still available, which corresponds to the state 2. In this state, the \n\ncorrective maintenance process, which consists of the installation or reinstallation of the \n\nsystem, starts. There is a tolerable downtime (TDT) inside which the system may operate in \n\nthis degraded condition. If the repair process cannot be completed within this TDT, the system \n\ngoes into state 3 where additional corrective actions are taken to restore it to its normal \n\noperating condition, but in this case the system is unavailable. It is assumed that all corrective \n\nactions recover the system to the same condition it had just before the failure. In other words, \n\ncorrective actions are considered as minimal repairs (q = 1.0). \n\nBesides the corrective maintenance actions, the system may also undergo preventive \n\nmaintenance events (state 4) which possess an effectiveness q. It is assumed that all \n\npreventive maintenance occurrence times are known at the start of the mission (at t=0). This \n\npreventive maintenance policy corresponds to a particular individual in the GA optimization \n\nalgorithm, i.e., the NHSMP model is evaluated for each potential solution, (t1, t2, \u2026, tn), \n\nduring the execution of the optimization procedure. \n\n( )11 ,G l t\n\n( )12 ,G l t( )21 ,G l t\n\n( )31 ,G l t\n\n( )11p t\n\n( )12p t( )21p t\n\n( )31p t\n\n( )23 ,G l t\n( )23p t\n\n \nFigure 7-2 \u2013 Non-Homogeneous semi-Markov processes for a hypothetical system \n\nIt is also considered that a preventive maintenance action corresponds to an imperfect one, \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 71\n\ni.e., it recovers the system to a condition somewhere between perfect and minimal repairs. \n\nThe state space diagram is illustrated in Figure 7-2, where the dotted lines represent the \n\ntransitions due to the preventive maintenance events. \n\nAs it has been previously discussed, the goal is to establish a preventive maintenance \n\npolicy that maximizes the mean availability of this system, which in turn is modeled via \n\nNHSMP whose required parameters are given in Table 7-1. Other requisite data are T = 150 \n\ndays; Tp = 1 day; N = 5 maintenances; cp = $10.00; cc = $30.00; K = $200.00. The GA-based \n\nrequired parameters are showed in Moura et al.

Semi-Markov Processes for Decision-Making \n\nAs it has been seen previously in section 1.2.2 and chapter 6, pressure-temperature optical \n\nsensors have been developed to improve the management and control of oil reservoirs. One of \n\ntheir aims is to decrease the number and impact of intrusive maintenance interventions since \n\nthe (re)installation procedures are human intensive and might influence the life of the \n\nmonitored systems. Therefore, maintenance policies that jointly optimize mean availability \n\nand expected cost rate associated with maintenance interventions on monitored systems are a \n\nmust in oil industries. \n\nThis section proposes a multiobjective optimization model based on semi-Markov \n\ndecision processes (SMDP) to find a set of nondominated maintenance policies. Each \n\nobtained policy is of threshold type and it represents the optimal decision (do-nothing, \n\nminimal maintenance or replacement) whenever the system enters a new deterioration stage. \n\nAn example of application is also discussed. This section is based on the findings of Moura et \n\nal. (2009), which follows in attachment J. \n\n7.2.1. Description of the problem \n\nConsidered that data collected from OMS might be used in a pattern recognition technique \n\n(e.g., Support Vector Machines (SVM), see Burges (1998) and Shawe-Taylor (2000)) to \n\nindicate at which deterioration state the system is. Given that, adequate actions should be \n\ntaken so that the number of interventions is minimized. \n\nDue to the complexity of systems from oil industry, these interventions are intrusive, \n\nhighly human-intensive and cost-consuming and thus minimizing them means decreasing the \n\nimpact of human performance on the system and related costs as well. \n\nPreventive actions, which set a periodic interval to perform planned maintenances, ignore \n\nthe health status of a physical equipment/system. Therefore, they may not be adequate to oil \n\nindustry systems since sometimes they would imply unnecessary actions, i.e., as system has \n\nnot crossed the critical deterioration line yet. On the other hand, pre-set times for preventive \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 74\n\nactions might also not pay enough attention on the system, even if a latent failure will take \n\nplace next. Both situations are cost and time consuming and should be attenuated. \n\nIn this way, according to Jardine et al. (2006) more efficient maintenance approaches such \n\nas condition-based maintenance (CBM) may be implemented to handle this situation. CBM is \n\na maintenance program that recommends maintenance actions based on the information \n\ncollected through condition monitoring (OMS, for instance). CBM attempts to avoid systems \n\nbeing over or under maintained by taking maintenance actions only when there is evidence of \n\nabnormal behaviors of a physical asset.  \n\nIf properly established and effectively implemented, a CBM program can significantly \n\ndiminish maintenance costs by reducing the number of scheduled preventive maintenance \n\noperations. \n\nOne of the main key steps of a CBM program is to recommend efficient decision policies, \n\nwhich involves maintenance decision-making analysis that essentially depends on the system \n\ndeterioration states. \n\nSuppose a hypothetical system is monitored continuously, data on physical variables are \n\ncollected from OMS, and then processed to find the system deterioration state. Moreover, \n\nassume there are three possible decisions which, generally speaking, will depend on the \n\nsystem state: do-nothing (N), minimal maintenance (M) or replacement (R). \n\nBasically, this section is based on the work of Moustafa et al. (2004). Similarly to them, it \n\nis allowed one of three decisions ?i = {N, M, R} at each deterioration state i. Moreover, SMDP \n\nwill be used. \n\nHowever, from this point the approach adopted here departs from the one presented in \n\nMoustafa et al. (2004). Firstly, it will be considered two objectives to optimize: the expected \n\nlong-run cost rate and the expected availability, whereas in Moustafa et al. (2004) just the \n\nexpected long-run cost rate is minimized. Secondly and conversely to Moustafa et al. (2004), \n\nin order to handle this multiobjective problem, a multiobjective genetic algorithm is applied \n\n(see Deb (1999)). Thirdly and finally, the Lap-method developed in this thesis will be used in \n\norder to estimate the mean availability measure. \n\nSome optimization approaches have been presented in literature in order to attain optimal \n\nmaintenance policies for the single objective problem. For instance, Castanier et al. (2003) \n\ninvestigate the problem of inspecting and maintaining a repairable system subject to \n\ncontinuous deterioration processes. They aim to find a policy, by means of Markov renewal \n\napproach, that optimizes system performance. Chen and Trivedi (2005) use an SMDP value \n\niteration algorithm to find the optimal maintenance policy jointly with the optimal inspection \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 75\n\nrate. Kim and Makis (2009) apply SMDP with a modified policy iteration algorithm in order \n\nto find an optimal maintenance policy, such as in previous works, concerning only the \n\nminimization of the expected long-run cost rate. \n\nNote that the mentioned works consider only a single objective optimization and, as \n\nasserted by Castanier et al. (2003), there is a necessity of optimization schemes adapted to the \n\nmultiobjective nature of maintenance problems. \n\nIn a multiobjective optimization perspective, instead of finding a unique solution (an \n\noptimal maintenance policy), one may obtain a set of nondominated maintenance policies that \n\npresent the compromise between the considered objectives (in this work, expected long run \n\ncost and mean availability).  \n\nDeb (1999) emphasizes that evolutionary algorithms such as GA are useful tools in \n\nhandling multiobjective problems since they consider various potential solutions in a single \n\nrun and several objectives can be treated separately. \n\nBasically, given a solution provided by the multiobjective GA, the embedded SMDP \n\ncalculates the associated values of both objectives, which are fed back to the multiobjective \n\nGA. Thus, solutions evolve throughout algorithm iterations by means of the genetic operators. \n\nAn evaluation of the dominance-nondominance relation between every pair of potential \n\nsolutions takes place and, at the end, a set of nondominated maintenance policies may be \n\nobtained. \n\nTherefore, the main purpose of this section is to determine a way of how the decisions ?i = \n\n{N, M, R} should be made in order to determine a set of nondominated steady state \n\nmaintenance policies which minimize the expected long-run cost rate as well as maximizing \n\nthe expected system availability via continuous time SMDP and multiobjective GA. In fact, \n\nthe Lap-method described for continuous-time SMP will be adopted to compute the mean \n\navailability of the system. Regarding the multiobjective GA portion of the model, details may \n\nbe found in Moura et al. (2009). The model SMDP-GA will be validated in subsection 7.2.3, \n\ncomparing its results against an exhaustive multiobjective algorithm that assesses all possible \n\nmaintenance policies. \n\n7.2.2. Model Characteristics \n\nSMDP will be used here to tackle the behavior of some systems in oil industry since it is \n\nassumed that the local time spent at each state influences the system dynamics. For the sake of \n\nsimplicity, the analysis is accomplished at system level. \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 76\n\nIn this section, the SMDP\u2019s role is to determine which actions should be made at each \n\ndecision epoch so that to optimize long-run cost rate and availability. Conversely to Love et \n\nal. (2000), who consider the time as the system goes down as a decision epoch, and similarly \n\nto Moustafa et al. (2004), it is assumed here a decision should be made at each time when the \n\ndeterioration state changes. \n\nAt every decision epoch, an action must be taken, which implies some costs and elapsed \n\ntimes, for example, cost to replace the system or time to perform a minimal maintenance. \n\nThus, the aim is to determine a sequence of decisions, which jointly optimize mean costs and \n\navailability, by using SMDP. \n\nAccording to Makis and Jardine (1993), the optimal replacement policy for this type of \n\nsystem is of the control-limit form (threshold type). That is, for ith state there is a decision ?i = \n\n{N, for i &lt;k1; M, for k1 ? i &lt;k2; R, for i ? k2}, where k1 and k2 are the threshold indexes. \n\nLet S = {1, \u2026, n+1} represent the finite state space, where the state 1 represents the initial \n\noperational system and n+1 means the system reaches the most critical deterioration stage (see \n\nFigure 7-4). At these states, the decisions are do-nothing and replacement, respectively. \n\nBetween these extreme states, there are some intermediate ordered deterioration stages i, \n\nwhere it is needed to determine what is the more adequate action (?i = {N; M; R}) that should \n\nbe taken to optimize the expected long-run costs and availability. \n\n1,2p\n\n2,3p\n1,3p\n\n1, 1ip ?\n\n1,ip\n\n1, 1ip +\n\n1,np\n\n1, 1np +\n\n2, 1ip ?\n\n2,ip\n\n2, 1ip +\n\n2, 1np +\n\n, 1n np +\n\n2,np\n\n \n\nFigure 7-4 \u2013 State diagram for SMDP \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 77\n\nSuppose, for example, the considered system might go through n deterioration stages \n\nbefore reach the highest deterioration level as can be seen in Figure 7-4. At each state, there \n\nare either rewards (availability) and/or losses (costs) depending on the decision to be made. \n\nFor decision \u201cdo-nothing\u201d, which may be made at any state i ? S \u2013 {n+1}, there is an \n\noperating cost per unit time of ai. For decision \u201cminimal maintenance\u201d, for each state i ? S \u2013 \n\n{1, n+1}, there are the mean maintenance cost bi and time ti. Just after this action, the system \n\ngoes to state (i-1) and restart its operation from there. For decision \u201creplacement\u201d, which may \n\nbe taken at any state i ? S \u2013 {1}, there are the mean replacement cost ci and time ri. The \n\nsystem returns to \u201cas good as new\u201d condition at state 1, immediately after a replacement. For \n\nthe two last decisions (M, R), there is also an idle cost m related to the elapsed time during \n\nwhich the system is not operational.  \n\nThus, it is needed to choose the set of pairs (k1, k2) of thresholds that will point out the \n\ndecisions to be made at each state so that the expected long-run cost rate *?G  and availability \n\n*\n?A  are minimized and maximized, respectively. \n\n*\n?G  and \n\n*\n?A  are given as follows: \n\nt\ntCtCtCtCE\n\nG urmp\nt\n\n))()()()((\nlim*\n\n+++\n=\n\n??\n?

(2, n]), the system is completely recovered to the first deterioration level. In \n\naccordance with Castanier et al. (2003), because of this regenerative property, and following a \n\nwidely used approach in maintenance modeling based on the renewal theorem, the long-run \n\nstudy (i.e. on an infinite time span) of the deterioration process can be limited to the study of \n\nthe system state evolution on a single renewal cycle defined by the time period between the \n\ninstant when the system enters the first state and the moment when it undergoes a \n\nreplacement. \n\nIn that way, one may calculate eqs. (7-6) and (7-7) by considering just a replacement cycle \n\nthrough eqs.

Associated with \n\nT(k1, k2), follow C(k1, k2) which is the expected long-run cost. Eq. (7-9) in turn is computed by \n\nsettling the mission time at T(k1, k2) and using the Lap-method described in section 3.2 since \n\nSMDP is considered homogeneous in relation to the process time. \n\n7.2.3. Example \n\nAs previously discussed, the system under analysis might go through n states, before \n\nreaching the most critical deterioration state n+1. Hence, it is adopted here a multiobjective \n\nperspective integrated with SMDP, for handling the problem of characterizing the sequence of \n\ndecisions along the n states. In this section, the results of the proposed model are validated by \n\nmeans of an exhaustive multiobjective example. \n\nDecisions are made in accordance with the pairs (k1, k2) of thresholds that jointly optimize \n\nthe expected long-run cost (eq. (7-8)) and availability (eq. (7-9)). \n\nTable 7-3 presents cost data in monetary units and the distribution functions Fi of the \n\nwaiting time in the state i needed to feed the SMDP portion.

In the case of three possible decisions and hence two threshold indexes, this quantity \n\nis defined as: \n\nnMP = 1\n2\n\n)1(\n+\n\n?nn  (7-10) \n\nOn the other hand, the multiobjective GA has an upper limit to the quantity of SMDP \n\nassessments, which is given by:  \n\nnEval ? nInd .

This occurs since only different potential solutions may be \n\nevaluated by means of SMDP and, as the multiobjective GA evolves and converges towards \n\nthe nondominated set, there is a reduction of the number of different solutions to be assessed. \n\nTaking this fact into consideration, it was set n = 50. \n\nAll experiments were executed in the same PC setting as in chapters 4 and 6.

Comments \n\nThis section proposed a multiobjective optimization model based on semi-Markov \n\ndecision processes for the optimal replacement policy for monitored systems from oil \n\nindustry. The proposed multiobjective approach was validated by means of an exhaustive \n\nalgorithm and was able to find almost all solutions from the true nondominated set in a \n\nconsiderable reduced time frame.  \n\nThe ongoing research is to integrate this multiobjective portion with a Gamma process \n\nwhich has been commonly used to address issues related to continuous degradation (see \n\nNoortwijk (2009) for more details). In this way, the work developed by Castanier et al. (2003) \n\nwould be extended. \n\nMoreover, following the findings in Kim and Makis (2009), in upcoming developments, it \n\nwill also be considered imperfect maintenance actions which will allow recovering the system \n\nto an intermediate deterioration state between the \u201cas good as new\u201d and \u201cas bad as old\u201d \n\nconditions. \n\n7.3. Pattern Recognition Problem through Support Vector Machines \n\nClustering the continuous data acquired via intelligent technologies into a set of discrete \n\nstates, which is given in Figure 7-4, is the first step of the proposed model described in \n\nprevious section. This requirement consists in collecting data, training them using a pattern \n\nrecognition technique and analyzing its effectiveness on unseen data. \n\nBasically, it corresponds to a multi-classification problem in which each state i represents \n\na category where the system could be. The work presented in the previous section is supposed \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 82\n\nto start from the definition of this set of states and requires that a pattern recognition model \n\ndetermines periodically the condition state. \n\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) has been successfully applied to pattern recognition and \n\nregression problems. SVM is able to obtain noteworthy results when a data set \n\n( ) ( ){ }1 1,..., ,..., ,...,l lx y x y ?? \u00d7?  is available for training, where ?  denotes the space of the input \n\npoints (e.g., d? = ? , where d is the ?  dimension). For instance, these might be time to failure \n\n(Hong and Pai (2006)), dissolved gases content in power transformer oil (Fei et al. (2009)) or \n\nreliability of software (Pai (2006)). \n\nExperimental results have revealed SVM performs better than other techniques such as \n\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN), Grey Model, Multi-Layer Perceptron network-based \n\nmethod, the Radial Basis Function network-based method, and autoregressive integrated \n\nmoving average (see Pai (2006)). \n\nThere are two main reasons which explain SVM surpasses these techniques (mainly ANN, \n\nwhich are one of the commonest methods used in forecasting): (i) rather than backed up the \n\nempirical risk minimization (which minimizes the training errors) as ANN, SVM makes use \n\nof the structural risk minimization. Through this principle, SVM seeks to minimize an upper \n\nbound on the generalization error. This fact plays an important role since minimizing the \n\nnumber of training errors appears to be computationally demanding and it guarantees good \n\ngeneralization performance as well; (ii) solving a classification or regression problem via \n\nSVM corresponds to deal with a convex quadratic optimization problem. Karush-Kuhn-\n\nTucker conditions state a necessary clause for a point ? ?  to be a global solution and also are \n\nsufficient conditions when the objective function is convex. \n\nTherefore, SVM are not plagued with the problem of local minima as ANN are. For more \n\ndetails on these SVM characteristics see Shawe-Taylor (2000) and Burges (1998) for the \n\nclassification problem and Smola and Scholkoff (2004) for the regression case. \n\nIn this way, SVM could have be used to address the pattern recognition (multi-\n\nclassification) problem necessary as an intial step to tackle a condition monitoring problem \n\nsuch as the one discussed in previous section. This is issue of our ongoing research. \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 83\n\n8. CONCLUSIONS \n\n8.1. Final Remarks \n\nContinuous-time homogeneous semi-Markov processes are important probabilistic tools to \n\nmodel reliability measures for systems whose future behavior is dependent on the current and \n\nnext states of the process and on sojourn times, besides the process time in case of non-\n\nhomogeneity. \n\nSMP have been traditionally solved via the N2-method described in Corradi et al. (2004) \n\nand Janssen and Manca (2001) for HSMP and NHSMP respectively, where the system \n\ndynamics are assessed via interval transition probability equations comprised of a set of N2 \n\ncoupled integral equations. However, as it can be seen in chapters 4 and 6, this approach has \n\nbeen rather burdensome and is not straightforward to implement. \n\nThis reason has motivated delving for a more efficient numerical treatment of SMP with \n\nless computational effort and with a comparable accuracy in relation to the available methods \n\nin the related literature (MC simulation and the N2-approach). \n\nTherefore, this research has given rise to the 2N-mathematical formulation and numerical \n\ntreatment which consists of casting the N2 coupled integral equations into an initial value \n\nproblem involving transition frequency densities, and then solve N coupled integral equations \n\nwith one variable and N straightforward integrations. Through the analysis of some examples, \n\nit has been seen this approach possesses the two aforementioned features: the 2N-method \n\nconvergence speed is greater than the other approaches and has a discrepancy from the MC-\n\nresults smaller than that of N2-approach, corroborating the main findings provided in section \n\n5.2 on the upper limit of the 2N-discretization error.  \n\nSpeaking specifically on NHSMP, the 2N-method plays an important role to leverage the \n\nfeasibility of application of this type of stochastic model. Although NHSMP are powerful \n\nmodeling tools, the mathematical and computational difficulties inherent to the N2-method on \n\nthe non-homogeneous environment are usually blamed as accountable for the impracticability \n\nof this type of stochastic process. \n\nAlthough 2N-method has showed meaningful outcomes in terms of computational effort \n\nand accurateness as well, both approaches (2N- and N2-) have an important drawback to be \n\nconsidered: they require increasing the algorithm\u2019s order (number M of steps) so that to attain \n\ngreater accuracy. Hence, this reason increases the effort for solving semi-Markov processes, \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 84\n\nsince the minimum number M of steps to reach a maximum discretization error should be \n\nknown previously. \n\nThis situation has motivated the development of the Lap-numerical procedure which made \n\nuse of Laplace Transforms for solving HSMP. Through a couple of examples of application in \n\nthe context of reliability engineering, Lap-procedure has showed some noteworthy \n\nadvantages: (i) it used a pre-set number of steps, which is independent on the problem to be \n\nsolved. Thus, it is not required anymore adjusting (through either trial-error tests or \n\ndynamically) the number M of steps in order to attain the desired convergence. (ii) thus, it \n\nreduced considerably the computational effort in relation to the 2N- and N2-methods and MC \n\nas well. (iii) Lap-numerical procedure has been designed for treating HSMP specified in terms \n\nof either transition probabilities or transition rates (iv) it has possessed accurateness \n\ncomparable to the 2N- and N2-method and MC solution. However, the same meaningful \n\nresults have not been encountered for the non-homogeneous case, as can be seen in Moura \n\nand Droguett (2007). \n\nFinally, this thesis has presented two further examples. In those examples, the numerical \n\nprocedures developed in this work have been used in optimization and decision-making \n\nproblems. \n\nIndeed, the first example have developed an approach to maximize the mean availability \n\nby identifying an optimal maintenance policy for a hypothetical system, which is modeled \n\naccording to a non-homogeneous semi-Markov processes. Hence, the 2N-method, which has \n\nbeen drawn for NHSMP in chapter 6, has been used to estimate the availability measure. \n\nGenetic algorithms in turn have been adopted to perform the optimization task of the \n\napproach. \n\nThe aim of the second further example has been to establish a way of how the decisions \n\ndo-nothing, minimal maintenance and replacement should be made in order to determine a set \n\nof nondominated steady state maintenance policies which jointly minimize the expected long-\n\nrun cost rate as well as maximizing the expected system availability via continuous time \n\nSMDP and multiobjective GA. Thus, the Lap-method described for continuous-time SMP has \n\nbeen adopted to compute the mean availability of the system. The model SMDP-GA was \n\nvalidated comparing its results against an exhaustive multiobjective algorithm. \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 85\n\n8.2. Limitations, Ongoing Research and Future Challenges \n\n8.2.1. Semi-Markov Processes: Requisite data, 2N- and Lap-methods \n\nRegarding semi-Markov processes, three important limitations of this work deserve \n\nattention. Firstly discussing semi-Markov processes in general, we have the well-known and \n\nalready quoted difficulty in obtaining the requisite data to analyze semi-Markov processes, \n\nmainly on the non-homogeneous environment. Regarding this issue, El-Gohary (2004) \n\npresents maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimates of the parameters included in a semi-\n\nMarkov reliability model of three states.  \n\nThe second limitation lies on how to find out a number M of steps to minimize the \n\ndiscretization error computed from the 2N-method. Up to now, this variable is not calculated \n\non simulation time what makes necessary to test several solutions of the 2N-method (with \n\ndifferent M) and check them out in comparison with the MC results. Sometimes, this is a quite \n\ntough task. This is the issue of our ongoing scientific researches. \n\nThirdly, one drawback that deserves attention on the Lap-method is since this approach is \n\nbased upon Gaussian Quadratures theory there is not a quite simple way to obtain an estimate \n\nof the absolute error committed by the approach (see Press et al. (2002) for more details). This \n\nis also topic of our ongoing research. \n\nAs suggestion of future works, one could apply other numerical inversion Laplace \n\ntransform methods such as Cuomo et al. (2007) in order to compare with the results provided \n\nin the present work. \n\n8.2.2. Support Vector Machines \n\nAs it has been mentioned in section 7.3, the first steps in a condition-based maintenance \n\nproblem correspond to clustering the continuous data acquired via intelligent technologies into \n\na set of discrete states. This requirement would consist in gathering data, training them using a \n\npattern recognition technique and analyzing its adequateness to test data. \n\nBasically, it consists of a multi-classification problem in which each state i represents a \n\npattern. Thus, the findings presented in section 7.2 are supposed to start from the definition of \n\nthis set of states and requires that a pattern recognition model determines periodically the \n\ncondition state. \n\nOne subject of our current research is to use support vector machines to address the former \n\nsteps of a condition-based problem. Mainly, due to the reasons explained in section 7.3, SVM \n\nhas been successfully applied not only to pattern recognition problems, but also to regression \n\n\n\nChapter 7                                                                                 Further Examples and Comments \n \n\n 86\n\nones, surpassing techniques as Artificial Neural Networks, Grey Model, Multi-Layer \n\nPerceptron network-based method, the Radial Basis Function network-based method, and \n\nautoregressive integrated moving average (see Pai (2006)), what underpins its use for treating \n\nCBM related matters. \n\n \n\n\n\nReferences \n\n 87\n\nREFERENCES \n\nAbate, J. and Valk\u00f3, P.
