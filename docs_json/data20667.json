Introduction\n\nThe Brazilian freshwater fish fauna is extremely diverse, \nwith more than 2,500 valid species distributed through \nseveral habitat types and river systems, and there is a growing \nnumber of new species being described (Buckup et al., \n2007). However, river basins in Brazil are becoming \nincreasingly transformed by human activities, particularly \n\nin the southeastern and southern regions, where land use \nchange, pollution and damming for hydroelectricity are the \nmain factors affecting fish conservation (Agostinho et al., \n2008; Barletta et al., 2010). This continuous process of \nenvironmental change threatens the existence of fish species \nand their habitats, therefore conservation planning and \n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 2013, vol. 73, no. 1, p. 79-90\n\nBecker, FG. et al.\n\n80\n\nprioritization require information on species composition \nand distribution in relatively large areas. In Brazil, surveys \nfor improving the knowledge base on freshwater fishes \nare frequently called for (Vari and Malabarba, 1998; \nAgostinho et al., 2005, 2008; Buckup et al., 2007).\n\nIn this paper, we present the results of a fish species \nsurvey in the Taquari-Antas river basin (26.470 km2), in \nsouthern Brazil. This region has been historically affected by \nurban, industrial and agricultural activities, although there \nare several relatively less affected areas of Atlantic forest \nand natural grasslands. In the early 2000s, river damming \nfor hydropower generation became an additional cause of \nenvironmental transformation. By the end of 2010, there \nwere 26 hydroelectric power plants (from&lt;1 MW to 130 \nMW) in operation or under construction in the Taquari-\nAntas basin, with more than 80 sites under examination \nfor potentially new dams (data from the Rio Grande do Sul \nState Foundation for Environment Protection \u2013 FEPAM, \nand from the Brazilian electric power authority database, \nANEEL/SIGEL). In the lower Taquari river there is also \na canal lock for navigation, which can be considered the \nfirst obstacle for upstream fish migration.\n\nIn spite of a relatively large number of recent taxonomic \nstudies and fish sampling across the Taquari-Antas basin, \na consolidated overview of the fish species composition \nand distribution is lacking. Studies providing a wider \nperspective of the Taquari-Antas fishes were only recently \npublished (Malabarba et al., 2009; Luz-Agostinho et al., \n2010), however their scope was limited to specific regions \nwithin the watershed. Malabarba et al. (2009) surveyed \nthe fishes from the high basaltic plateau, including the \nheadwaters of the Taquari-Antas and Ca\u00ed rivers (both in \nthe Patos Lagoon basin) and of Pelotas and Canoas rivers \n(upper Uruguay river basin). They found 46 species and a \n\nhigh degree of endemism for fishes of the Jacu\u00ed headwaters \n(21.7%), which include the Taquari-Antas headwaters. \nLuz-Agostinho et al. (2010) found 70 species in the mid-\nstretch of the Taquari-Antas and several tributaries, and \nalso report baseline information on the reproduction and \nfeeding of several species.\n\nOur main objective is to present a comprehensive \nsurvey of the fish species of the Taquari-Antas basin. We \nused primary data from our own field collections, but also \ncompiled a large amount of secondary data, including samples \nfrom several different habitats. In particular, we aimed at \nproducing a species list that is the best approximation of the \nactual species composition in the studied area, and where \ntaxonomic consistence and uncertainties are objectively \npointed out. We also assessed the fish fauna in terms of \nnon-native species, conservation status, general spatial \ndistribution patterns, species with restricted geographical \ndistribution, and migratory species.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n\n2.1. Study area\n\nThe Taquari-Antas basin is situated in southern Brazil \n(state of Rio Grande do Sul) and is one of the main sub-\nbasins of the Patos Lagoon basin (Figure 1), which is a large \ndrainage flowing into the Atlantic Ocean and is one of the \nfreshwater ecoregions recognized by Abell et al. (2008). \nIt is a 7th order river basin (Strahler, 1957; stream network \nmap at 1:250.000 scale) with a total area of 26.470 km2. \nThe Antas river, as the main river is called in the upper \nsection of the basin, flows from a high basaltic plateau \n(ca. 800 to 1200 m a.s.l) through deeply incised valleys \nuntil the lowlands, where it is known as Taquari river. \n\nFigure 1. Geographic location of the Taquari-Antas basin within the Patos Lagoon basin.\n\n\n\nBraz. J. Biol., 2013, vol. 73, no. 1, p. 79-90\n\nFishes of the Taquari-Antas river\n\n81\n\nThe lowlands flow through terrains formed by alluvial \ndeposits in elevations between 20 m to 100 m a.s.l. The \nmain river channel, from headwaters to the confluence \nwith Jacu\u00ed river, is ca. 400 km long and the mean annual \nflow is 606 m3.s-1 (Rio Grande do Sul, 2007).\n\n2.2. Species records\n\nWe determined the fish species of the Taquari-Antas \nbasin from primary and secondary data. Primary data were \nobtained by sampling fish assemblages at several localities \nacross the study area during 2010. Secondary data were \nobtained by reviewing and validating records from the \nlargest and most regionally representative fish collections \n(Museu de Ci\u00eancias Naturais da Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Zoobot\u00e2nica do \nRio Grande do Sul, MCN; Museu de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia \nda Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul, \nMCP; Department of Zoology of Universidade Federal do \nRio Grande do Sul, UFRGS). Additionally, we reviewed \nspecies records from scientific publications and technical \nenvironmental reports available at FEPAM.\n\nThe fish records compiled comprise samples obtained \nby several different fishing techniques (gill nets, seine nets, \ncast nets, dip nets and electrofishing) and encompassed \nseveral habitat types (small streams to large rivers, reservoirs \nand small wetlands).\n\n2.3. Geographical coordinates of species records\n\nAfter compiling the fish record database for the whole \nTaquari-Antas basin, we found three types of geographic \nlocation data: (a) descriptions of the sampling site geographic \nlocation without geographic coordinates (found mostly in \nmuseum records and in bibliographic sources), (b) geographic \ncoordinates that had been obtained in the field, using GPS \nreceivers and (c) geographic coordinates from unknown \nsources. In the first case, we approximated geographic \ncoordinates on the basis of the site descriptions or site \nlocations pictured in maps included in the bibliographic \nsources, using a geographic information system ArcGis \n(ESRI) and the digital version of the official 1:50.000 \ncartographic database of Rio Grande do Sul (Hasenack \nand Weber, 2010). This cartographic database includes the \nstream network, roads, cities and detailed toponymy, and \nis usually used by researchers for field navigation and for \ndescribing sampling site locations. Information about the \ndatum associated with geographic coordinates was rare in \nthe database, therefore we assumed WGS84 for all records.\n\n2.4. Taxonomic validation\n\nFish samples collected by the authors were identified \nor validated by taxonomy specialists. Voucher specimens \nof all species can be found in at least one of the reviewed \nmuseum collections (MCN, MCP, UFRGS). Species \nrecords from secondary sources (museum databases and \nnon-taxonomic bibliographic sources) have been subject \nto nomenclature actualization (e.g., Astyanax alburnus \nto Cyanocharax alburnus, cf. Malabarba and Weitzman, \n2003; Pimelodus maculatus to Pimelodus pintado, cf. \nAzpelicueta et al., 2008). Museum specimens were \nexamined only when the actual presence of a species in \nthe Taquari-Antas basin depended exclusively on the valid \nidentification of a particular sample. We did not consider \nas valid any record with dubious taxonomic identification \nand that could not be validated by examining vouchers \n\nspecimens in scientific collections. We also excluded \nany record with a geographic location that could not be \nunequivocally determined to be within the Taquari-Antas \nbasin. The taxonomic classification follows Reis et al. \n(2003a), except for the use of Labriformes (Wiley and \nJohnson, 2010).\n\nWe assessed the species conservation status according \nto the endangered species list of Rio Grande do Sul \n(Reis et al., 2003b) and the Brazilian list of endangered \nfish species (Instru\u00e7\u00e3o Normativa do Minist\u00e9rio do Meio \nAmbiente n\u00ba 05, 21 de maio de 2004). To determine species \nwith restricted geographical ranges (<10.000 km2 sensu \nNogueira et al., 2010), we used data from our survey and \nprimary literature, rather than assuming a priori only the \nspecies listed by Nogueira et al. (2010). We considered as \nmigratory those species mentioned by Luz-Agostinho et al. \n(2010). Any species whose natural distribution does not \ninclude the Patos Lagoon basin was considered as non-\nnative. We also described the general distribution pattern \nof species across the main geomorphological sections \nof the Taquari-Antas basin (Lowlands, Mid-slopes, and \nPlateau). Species were classified as typical of a section \nwhen >70% of their records were included in only one \nsection. Species occurring in all sections and with more \nthan 30% records in at least two sections were considered \nto be well distributed across the Taquari-Antas basin.\n\n3. Results\n\nWe obtained 5,299 valid presence records of fish \nspecies in the Taquari-Antas basin, representing 119 species \n(including non-native species; Table 1) and 519 sampling \nsites (Figure 2). The total number of species (119) was \ndetermined only after a validation process on a preliminary \nlisting of 266 nominal taxa obtained from the secondary \ndata. Most sampling sites (43.3%) were located in higher \nelevation areas of the plateau, while the remaining were \nsituated in the slopes between the lowlands and the plateau \n(32%) and in the lowlands (24.7%) (Figure 2).\n\nThere were records for 13 non-native species (10.9% \nof the total number of species), six of which are native \nto other Neotropical river basins (Table 2). About 25% \nof the total native species are still lacking a taxonomic \ndescription at the species level. Several of the recorded \nspecies have a relatively limited geographical distribution \n(Table 2), including only the Taquari-Antas basin, or \nthe Taquari-Antas and adjacent neighboring watersheds \n(Upper Uruguay, Sinos, and Ca\u00ed river, and the headwaters \nof small coastal watersheds). Only Salminus brasiliensis is \nofficially listed as a threatened species (Reis et al., 2003b).\n\nAt least six migratory species were recorded in the \nTaquari-Antas basin: the long distance migrants Leporinus \nobtusidens, Prochilodus lineatus, Salminus brasiliensis, \nthe mid-distance migrants Parapimelodus nigribarbis and \nPimelodus pintado, and the non-native Acestrorhynchus \npantaneiro. The migratory species were represented by few \nlocality records (except for Pimelodus pintado, Figure 3), \nand were mostly limited to the mid- and lower sections of \nthe rivers, downstream the Cachoeir\u00e3o rapids, except for \none record of Leporinus obtusidens at the Tainhas river \n(see Figure 3). Pimelodus pintado was the most widely \ndistributed migratory species with several records upstream \nthe Cachoeir\u00e3o and in upper parts of the main tributaries \nof the Antas river (Prata, Carreiro and Guapor\u00e9 rivers).\n\n\n\nBraz.

From 2000 to 2011, several \nnew species occurring in the basin were described (e.g, \nSilva, 2004; Rodriguez and Reis, 2008; Carvalho et al., \n2008; Carvalho and Reis, 2009; Cognato et al., 2009; Ottoni \nand Cheffe, 2009; Menezes and Ribeiro, 2010; Ferrer and \nMalabarba, 2011; Menezes and Weitzman, 2011), but there \nare few studies and publications on ecology, reproductive \nbiology or conservation (Guadagnin et al., 1998; Majolo, \n2005; Alves and Fontoura, 2009; Hirschmann et al., 2008; \nLuz-Agostinho et al., 2010).\n\nThe number of species in the Taquari-Antas basin \nrepresents ca. 65% of the total number of known species \nfor the Patos Lagoon basin (160 species, including \n35 undescribed species; Malabarba et al., 2009). The \nnumber of native species in physiographically similar and \ngeographically close river basins varies from 51 (Pardinho \nriver, Patos Lagoon basin; Ribeiro and K\u00f6hler, 2007) to \n79 (Maquin\u00e9 river, in the Tramanda\u00ed river system; F. G. \nBecker, unpublished data) and 89 (Sinos river, Patos Lagoon \nbasin; Leal et al., 2009). However, a proper comparison \nis not possible because these studies used distinct survey \nmethods and because the studied watersheds vary in total \narea and ecological integrity.\n\nThe proportion of undescribed species in the Taquari-\nAntas is relatively large (23.6%) and similar to estimates for \nthe whole Patos Lagoon and Uruguay river basins (21.9% \nand 22.2%, respectively; Malabarba et al., 2009). It is \nparticularly important to note that part of these undescribed \nspecies are small headwater fish (e.g. Eurycheilichthys \nand Trichomycterus), with potentially small geographic \nranges, reinforcing the previous observations of a highly \nunderestimated diversity in the region (Malabarba et al., \n2009). As noted by Ferrer and Malabarba (2011), all the \nhighly endemic species described to the basaltic highlands \n(which include the Taquari-Antas mid-slope rivers and \n\nThe fish fauna of the Taquari-Antas presents a relatively \nclear distribution pattern across the three geomorphological \nsections of the basin (Figure 4). Most species (58%) are \ntypically distributed in lowland rivers and streams, but \nabout half of these species had at least a few records \n(<30% of total specific records) in the Mid-slope valleys \nand in the Plateau. A typical fish fauna is also found \nin the Plateau (20% of total native species), including \n16 species for which all records were located in this \ngeomorphological section. In the transition between \nthe Plateau and the Lowlands - i.e., the Mid-slopes \nsection - there is an overlap in the distribution of lowland \nspecies and headwater species, with few typical species \n(9.5% of total species). Only 12.4% of all native species \nwere relatively common in the three geomorphological \nsections (e.g., Bryconamericus iheringii, Characidium \npterostictum, Geophagus brasiliensis, Gymnotus aff. carapo, \nHyphessobrycon luetkenii, Phalloceros caudimaculatus).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAccording to our survey, knowledge about the fishes \nof the Taquari-Antas basin was relatively poor until the \nlate 1990s, and consisted of several records in museum \ndatabases (the oldest record in the examined collections \ndates from 1977; 62% of the collection records were \nsampled after 1999), and descriptions of species with \ngeographical distributions that included the region (e.g., \nMalabarba, 1989; Buckup, 1993; Malabarba and Mahler \nJunior, 1998; Cardoso and Malabarba, 1999). In the late \n1990s, fish sampling was intensified as part of baseline \nstudies for environmental impact assessments (EIA), which \nare demanded by the State and Federal environmental \nagencies (FEPAM and IBAMA) in Brazil. Vouchers of \nmost of these samples are now kept in the fish collections of \n\nTable 2.

It is also interesting that some undescribed \nspecies of Astyanax are widely distributed across adjacent \nriver basins, but at least two are potentially endemic to \nareas within the Taquari-Antas basin.\n\nThe main distribution of the migratory species in the \nAntas river seems to be limited upstream by the strong \nrapids known as \u201cCachoeir\u00e3o\u201d, as previously noted by \nLuz-Agostinho et al. (2010). However, these species \nwere represented by few records in our survey (except for \nP. pintado) and were not effectively sampled before the \nconstruction of the main dams in the Antas river (14 de \nJulho, Monte Claro and Castro Alves, in the early 2000s; \nFigure 3). The \u201cdourado\u201d, Salminus brasiliensis, probably \nused to be present in upper reaches of the basin, as suggested \nby occurrence data determined by Alves and Fontoura (2009) \nfrom interviews with fishermen. The migratory status of \nPimelodus pintado is still not well established (Alves and \nFontoura, 2009), but its reproductive behavior could be \nsimilar to Pimelodus maculatus. The latter species migrates \nfor long-distances, but is abundant in serially impounded \nrivers, as the Tiet\u00ea and Grande rivers (Agostinho et al., \n2007), probably being able to reproduce in shorter free \nriver stretches (Agostinho et al., 2003).\n\nWe registered a high proportion of species with small \ngeographical ranges (ca. 10000 km2 in range, following \nNogueira et al., 2010), either endemic to the Taquari-Antas \nbasin or not (Table 2). These numbers were based on \nrecent publications (see Table 1) and on-going taxonomic \ninvestigations (J. Ferrer; V. A. Bertaco; R. E. Reis), and add \nanother 11 species to those already listed by Nogueira et al. \n(2010). Most of these species occur in the upper portions of \nthe basin (only in the Plateau or also in the Mid-slopes and \nvalleys), as Eurycheilichthys spp. and Trichomycterus spp.. \nAt least one species is known only from its type locality \n(Bryconamericus ecai, Silva, 2004) despite the extensive \nsampling in the basin. Because restricted range species \nare potentially more susceptible to environmental impacts \nand to extinction, they should be considered as targets for \nassessments in conservation planning and environmental \nlicensing. This is particularly relevant in the Taquari-\n\nAntas basin, in face of the high potential for increase in \nthe number of dams for hydroelectric power production \nand for land transformation (forestry and agriculture) in \nthe upper sections of the basin.\n\nThe non-native species represented a relevant proportion \n(10.9%) of the total species registered in the basin, however \ninformation on their abundance, population dynamics \nand on their impacts on the native biota is still lacking. \nAbout half of the non-native species are original from \nnon-Neotropical regions; some of these were introduced \nin fish ponds for aquaculture production and escaped \ninto natural habitats (e.g. Cyprinus carpio, Ictalurus \npunctatus and Oreochromis niloticus), while others were \nreleased directly into streams and rivers for sport fishing \n(the black bass, Micropterus salmoides, and the rainbow \ntrout, Onchorynchus mykiss, particularly in streams of the \nbasaltic plateau). Results from a fish monitoring program \nwith extensive sampling between 2002-2009 indicated that \nnon-native species occur only in low abundances in the \nmid-lower Taquari-Antas, and evidence for reproductive \npopulations has been indirectly suggested only for C. carpio \n(Luz-Agostinho et al., 2010). Some of the Neotropical \nnon-natives were probably unintentionally introduced \nvia inter-basin man-made connections resulting from land \nmanagement for agriculture (rice fields), and eventually \ndispersed rapidly and reached high abundances in different \nparts of the Patos Lagoon basin (e.g. Pachyurus bonariensis \nand Trachelyopterus lucenai, see Becker, 2002; Saccol-\nPereira et al., 2006; Becker et al., 2007; Dufech and Fialho, \n2007). We found museum records (MCP) for Tilapia \nrendalli collected in fish ponds in the late 1970s, however \nthere was no record of this species in natural waters at the \nTaquari-Antas basin.\n\nConsidering the results of the present inventory, \nconservation in the Taquari-Antas basin should consider \nat least the following three components of the fish fauna. \nOne aspect is to protect habitat for migratory fish (including \nthe endangered Salminus brasiliensis), which can only be \naccomplished if some rivers receive no more dams. An \nexample is the Guapor\u00e9 river, which seems to function as \nan alternative reproductive area after the damming of the \nTaquari-Antas river (Luz-Agostinho et al., 2010). A second \npoint is the protection or restoration of streams and rivers \ncontaining restricted range and endemic species, which \nrequires an effort for formal description of these species \nand their geographical ranges. The third point is taking \naction to prevent the escapement of non-native species from \nfish ponds or their deliberate in natural waters, particularly \nwhere restricted range and endemic species are present.\n\nAcknowledgements \u2013 We would like to thank Marco A.
