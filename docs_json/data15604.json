Although \n\nsome Senegalese sole showed high site fidelity the majority of the individuals tagged \n\nwere more transient. Cuttlefish demonstrated no site fidelity to the study area, \n\nspending a maximum of 39 days inside the monitored area. The home range areas \n\n(95% KUD) ranged between 0.43 and 1.28 km2 (average of 0.65 km2) for white \n\nseabream and between 0.54 and 2.22 km2 (average of 1.19 km2) for Senegalese sole. \n\nThe results obtained for cuttlefish were not coherent given the low site fidelity \n\npresented by this species. White seabream demonstrated a clear preference for rocky \n\nbottoms habitats while Senegalese sole prefer sandy bottoms, especially medium grain \n\nsize sand. \n\nThe results of experimental fishing trials revealed no significant differences in the \n\nabundance or biomass of Senegalese sole or cuttlefish between the periods before and \n\nafter the implementation of the LSMP. \n\nThe species distribution models obtained with Maxent indicate that most of the LSMP \n\npresents suitable habitats for cuttlefish but only a small proportion is suitable for the \n\nSenegalese sole and white seabream. The Senegalese sole suitable habitats are mainly \n\nfound in sandy areas facing south whereas the white seabream suitable habitats are \n\nrestricted to the narrow rocky areas that border the coastline. \n\n\n\n10 \n \n\nOur results suggest that the existing marine reserve may offer appropriate protection \n\nfor Senegalese sole and white seabream. However, given the low site fidelity and the \n\nlarge movements of cuttlefish the LSMP does not provide adequate protection for this \n\nspecies.  \n\nAccording to the results of the different scenarios obtained with Marxan the design of \n\nthe LSMP could be improved in order to offer more protection to habitats that are not \n\nsufficiently protected with the current design. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Marine protected areas, acoustic telemetry, experimental fishing, species \n\ndistribution models, Maxent, Marxan. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n11 \n \n\nResumo \n \n\nNas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, a press\u00e3o antropog\u00e9nica sobre os ecossistemas marinhos tem \n\naumentado em magnitude e diversidade, causando uma degrada\u00e7\u00e3o dr\u00e1stica destes \n\nambientes. Este facto tem levantado s\u00e9rias preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es e levou a apelos para a \n\nimplementa\u00e7\u00e3o de medidas que visam proteger, preservar e restaurar os ecossistemas \n\nmarinhos. Uma das medidas que tem recebido maior aten\u00e7\u00e3o e apoio por parte da \n\ncomunidade cient\u00edfica nos \u00faltimos 30 anos \u00e9 a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas marinhas \n\nprotegidas.  \n\nAs \u00e1reas marinhas protegidas podem apresentar uma grande variedade de desenhos, \n\ngest\u00e3o e extens\u00e3o da prote\u00e7\u00e3o, dependendo das caracter\u00edsticas biol\u00f3gicas, f\u00edsicas e \n\nsociais do lugar onde s\u00e3o implementadas e os objectivos que pretendem alcan\u00e7ar. No \n\nentanto, de acordo com a IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) uma \n\n\u00e1rea marinha protegida \u00e9 \u201cum espa\u00e7o geogr\u00e1fico claramente definido, reconhecido, \n\ndedicado e gerido, atrav\u00e9s de meios legais ou outros, para alcan\u00e7ar a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o a \n\nlongo prazo da natureza incluindo os servi\u00e7os ecossist\u00e9micos associados e os valores \n\nculturais.\u201d De um modo geral, a sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o visa atingir um ou ambos dos seguintes \n\nobjetivos: gest\u00e3o dos recursos marinhos e conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da biodiversidade e habitats . \n\nNa costa da Arr\u00e1bida, situada na \u00e1rea metropolitana de Lisboa e pr\u00f3xima do estu\u00e1rio \n\ndo Sado, foi estabelecida, em 1998, uma \u00e1rea marinha protegida designada Parque \n\nMarinho Luiz Saldanha (PMLS). Esta costa \u00e9 muito procurada por v\u00e1rios sectores \n\nrelacionados com o mar, desde actividades n\u00e1uticas de lazer a actividades como a \n\npesca e a apanha. Constitui uma zona de transi\u00e7\u00e3o, onde muitas esp\u00e9cies com \n\nafinidades de \u00e1gua fria e \u00e1gua quente atingem os seus limites norte e sul da \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00e3o, respectivamente. Com mais de 1.200 esp\u00e9cies registadas esta zona \u00e9 \n\nconsiderada um \u201chotspot\u201d europeu da biodiversidade marinha. Para al\u00e9m disso, o \n\nestu\u00e1rio do Sado \u00e9 conhecido como uma importante \u00e1rea de postura e/ou ber\u00e7\u00e1rio \n\npara v\u00e1rias esp\u00e9cies de peixes e cefal\u00f3podes. Devido ao conflito entre as actividades \n\nhumanas e os valores naturais desta \u00e1rea, o PMLS foi estabelecido com a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\n\n12 \n \n\nproteger a elevada biodiversidade e alguns dos habitats, bem como promover a \n\nsustentabilidade da pesca artesanal local. \n\nO principal objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar os potenciais benef\u00edcios do PMLS para tr\u00eas \n\ndas esp\u00e9cies mais importantes para a pesca artesanal local: o sargo Diplodus sargus, o \n\nlinguado senegal\u00eas Solea senegalensis e o choco Sepia officinalis. Tamb\u00e9m se \n\ninvestigaram poss\u00edveis altera\u00e7\u00f5es na abund\u00e2ncia e/ou biomassa destas esp\u00e9cies no \n\nPMLS ao longo do per\u00edodo de dura\u00e7\u00e3o deste estudo. \n\nFoi utilizada telemetria ac\u00fastica passiva para determinar padr\u00f5es de movimento, o \n\ntamanho das \u00e1reas de actividade e a fidelidade ao local das esp\u00e9cies em estudo. Vinte \n\nreceptores ac\u00fasticos, que cobriram uma \u00e1rea de aproximadamente 2 km2, detectaram \n\na presen\u00e7a de indiv\u00edduos previamente marcados com transmissores ac\u00fasticos (7 \n\nchocos, 20 sargos e 17 linguados). Para identificar poss\u00edveis altera\u00e7\u00f5es na abund\u00e2ncia \n\nou biomassa das esp\u00e9cies estudadas foi utilizada a pesca experimental, realizada 2 \n\nvezes por ano nos meses de Primavera e Outono. A pesca experimental foi efectuada \n\ncom recurso \u00e0 arte do tresmalho, seguindo as especifica\u00e7\u00f5es utilizadas pela frota \n\nartesanal local. Foram analisados um total de 106 lances de pesca (de 500m) realizados \n\nentre 2007 e 2011. \n\nUma elevada fidelidade ao local foi observada para o sargo, com todos os indiv\u00edduos \n\nmarcados com transmissores ac\u00fasticos V9 a serem detectados mais de 50% do tempo \n\n(m\u00e9dia de 85%). Embora alguns linguados tenham demonstrado uma elevada \n\nfidelidade ao local de estudo, a maioria dos indiv\u00edduos marcados foi mais transiente. \n\nPelo contr\u00e1rio, os chocos n\u00e3o demonstraram fidelidade ao local com apenas um \n\nexemplar a ser detectado por um per\u00edodo m\u00e1ximo de 39 dias. Os restantes exemplares \n\nmarcados foram detectados menos de 15 dias. Para al\u00e9m disso, nenhum choco voltou \n\na ser detectado ap\u00f3s ter abandonado a \u00e1rea monitorizada. A recaptura dum choco no \n\ninterior do estu\u00e1rio do Sado, a mais de 15 km do local de marca\u00e7\u00e3o evidencia as \n\nmigra\u00e7\u00f5es para o estu\u00e1rio.  \n\nAs \u00e1reas de actividade (95% KUD) variaram entre 0,43 e 1,28 km2 (m\u00e9dia de 0,65 km2) \n\npara os sargos e entre 0,54 e 2,22 km2 (m\u00e9dia de 1,19 km2) para os linguados. Os \n\n\n\n13 \n \n\nresultados obtidos para o choco n\u00e3o s\u00e3o relevantes dada a baixa fidelidade da esp\u00e9cie \n\nao local.  \n\nOs sargos demonstraram uma clara prefer\u00eancia por fundos rochosos enquanto os \n\nlinguados exibiram uma prefer\u00eancia por fundos arenosos, especialmente os \n\nconstitu\u00eddos por areia m\u00e9dia. \n\nOs resultados da pesca experimental n\u00e3o revelaram diferen\u00e7as significativas na \n\nabund\u00e2ncia ou biomassa de linguados ou chocos entre os per\u00edodos antes e ap\u00f3s a \n\nimplementa\u00e7\u00e3o do PMLS. \n\nA combina\u00e7\u00e3o destes resultados sugere que a actual \u00e1rea marinha protegida pode \n\noferecer prote\u00e7\u00e3o adequada para o sargo e potencialmente tamb\u00e9m para o linguado. \n\nNo entanto, dada a baixa fidelidade ao local e os grandes movimentos do choco, o \n\nPMLS n\u00e3o oferece uma prote\u00e7\u00e3o adequada para esta esp\u00e9cie. \n\nOs dados de telemetria foram posteriormente utilizados em conjunto com as vari\u00e1veis \n\n\u201chabitat\u201d, \u201cprofundidade\u201d, \u201caspecto\u201d, \u201cinclina\u00e7\u00e3o\u201d, \u201ccurvatura\u201d e \u201cdist\u00e2ncia a fundo \n\nrochoso\u201d, de modo a determinar modelos de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o para cada uma das esp\u00e9cies \n\nutilizando o m\u00e9todo de m\u00e1xima entropia (Maxent). Estes modelos de distribui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nsugerem que grande parte do habitat do PMLS \u00e9 adequado para chocos, mas apenas \n\numa pequena parte do PMLS apresenta habitats adequados para os sargos e os \n\nlinguados. No caso dos linguados, estes habitats est\u00e3o praticamente restringidos na \n\nparte voltada a Sul do PMLS. O habitat adequado para os sargos \u00e9 composto por uma \n\nestreita franja que contorna os recifes rochosos praticamente ao longo de toda a linha \n\nde costa do PMLS. \n\nPosteriormente, utilizou-se o Marxan para testar diferentes solu\u00e7\u00f5es para o design do \n\nPMLS. De acordo com os resultados dos diferentes cen\u00e1rios obtidos com Marxan, o \n\ndesenho do PMLS poderia ser melhorado de modo a oferecer mais prote\u00e7\u00e3o a alguns \n\ndos habitats que, com o presente desenho, apenas est\u00e3o parcialmente protegidos. No \n\nentanto, a localiza\u00e7\u00e3o da zona \u201cno-take\u201d est\u00e1 situada no local considerado como \n\n\u00f3ptimo. \n\n\n\n14 \n \n\nPalavras-chave: \u00e1reas marinhas protegidas,

Worldwide, scientists have documented the devastating \n\neffects of overexploitation (Pauly et al. 2005), habitat loss (Short &amp; Wyllie-Echeverria \n\n1996, Gray 1997), pollution (Jackson et al. 2001, Shahidul Islam &amp; Tanaka 2004), \n\ninvasive species (Molnar et al. 2008) and the negative consequences of increasing \n\ncoastal development (Bulleri &amp; Chapman 2010) and tourism (Hall 2001). According to \n\nthe FAO\u2019s latest report, around 57% of the worlds fish stocks are fully exploited and \n\nmore than 29% are overexploited (FAO 2012). These factors have raised serious \n\nconcerns and led to calls for the implementation of measures that aim to protect, \n\npreserve and restore marine ecosystems (Lubchenco et al. 2003).  \n\nOne measure that has received much attention and support from the scientific \n\ncommunity over the last thirty years is the implementation of marine protected areas \n\n(MPAs) (Roberts &amp; Polunin 1991, Gu\u00e9nette et al. 1998, Pauly et al. 1998, Kaiser 2011). \n\nAlthough they are not a new approach to conservation, MPA research and \n\nimplementation have escalated since the 1990\u2019s (Roberts &amp; Polunin 1991, Agardy et al. \n\n2003, Bogaert et al. 2009, McCay &amp; Jones 2011).  \n\nThe IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) defines MPAs as \u201cA clearly \n\ndefined geographical space, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or \n\nother effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with \n\nassociated ecosystem services and cultural values\u201d. MPAs present a wide range of \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\ndesign, management and extent of protection, depending on the biological, physical \n\nand social characteristics of the place where they are being implemented and the goals \n\nthey are intended to achieve. Most authors suggest their implementation to achieve \n\nbiodiversity and habitat conservation, marine resource management, or both (Roberts \n\n&amp; Polunin 1993, Agardy et al. 2003, Pauly et al. 2005, Claudet et al. 2008, Russ &amp; Alcala \n\n2011).  \n\nBiodiversity and habitat conservation includes an array of specific objectives such as \n\nprotecting rare and vulnerable habitats and species, restoring ecological functions, \n\nencouraging research and education, maintaining aesthetic values and traditional uses \n\nand promoting sustainable tourism and the area\u2019s nonconsumptive values (Jones \n\n2001). MPAs focusing on marine resource management have been strongly \n\nrecommended over the last decades as an alternative and/or complement to \n\ntraditional fisheries management methods (Roberts &amp; Polunin 1991, Pauly et al. 1998, \n\nMurawski et al. 2000, Pauly et al. 2005, Roberts et al. 2005, Kaiser 2011). The \n\necological benefits that MPAs may provide to fisheries include increases in stock \n\nabundance, age/size composition and spawning stock biomass, the enhancement of \n\nrecruitment in fished areas, the restoration of healthy trophic levels and spillover to \n\nadjacent areas (Edgar &amp; Barrett 1999, Murawski et al. 2000, Barrett et al. 2007, \n\nClaudet et al. 2008). In fact, recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of \n\nMPAs in the management of fisheries in adjacent areas (e.g. Abesamis et al. 2006, \n\nStobart et al. 2009, Go\u00f1i et al. 2010, Vandeperre et al. 2011) and in the recovery of \n\nhabitats (Leleu et al. 2012). Hence, one of the advantages of MPAs is that, unlike the \n\ntraditional \u2018single species\u2019 approach, MPAs offer an ecosystem based approach to \n\nconservation and fisheries management (Lubchenco et al. 2003, Crowder &amp; Norse \n\n2008). \n\nWhile there is widespread recognition of the potential of MPAs to achieve \n\nconservation and fisheries management goals, the proper functioning of MPAs is \n\nfrequently impaired by multiple knowledge gaps about key ecological aspects \n\nunderlying the functioning of MPAs, and their potential benefits.   \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nHence, it is critical to increase our understanding of the dynamics of MPAs and their \n\nperformance as fisheries management tools. In particular, it is important to fully \n\nunderstand species movement patterns and habitat use, and the amount of protection \n\noffered by MPAs. Filling these gaps will allow a better evaluation of the effectiveness \n\nof MPAs and the forecasting of their optimal designs. \n\n \n\nSpecies movement patterns and habitat use \n\nMPAs rely on spillover (export of adults/juveniles) and/or recruitment subsidy (export \n\nof larvae) in order to increase the yield of nearby fisheries (Bohnsack 1993, Sale et al. \n\n2005). Studies on fish movement patterns have increased in the past decades and, in \n\nsome occasions, successfully demonstrated the spillover effect (Abesamis et al. 2006, \n\nGo\u00f1i et al. 2008, Stobart et al. 2009). Ideally, this information should be taken in \n\nconsideration when defining the location and extent of MPAs and even later during the \n\nmanagement process. Yet, this information is rarely available before the \n\nimplementation of MPAs and therefore not integrated into the optimal design.  \n\nTogether with information on fish movement patterns, knowledge of species habitat \n\nuse is crucial for the design and adaptive management of MPAs, so as to guarantee not \n\nonly the existence of spillover but also that the size of the reserve unit is large enough \n\nto provide protection during large periods of their life cycle (Glazer &amp; Delgado 2006, \n\nGr\u00fcss et al. 2011). The existence of preferred habitats should also be investigated to \n\nmake sure MPAs provide the adequate habitats for the species involved. \n\nIn most cases there is no empirical information on the size of suitable habitats where \n\nspecies are effectively protected from local fisheries, even several years after the \n\nimplementation of MPAs. Acoustic telemetry is one of the most widely used methods \n\nto track marine species, as it provides long-term, fine scale spatio-temporal data on \n\nindividual movement and home range. However, little has been done yet and there is \n\nno consensus on how to translate such individual data - the typical output of telemetry \n\nstudies - into the more relevant population scale projection when evaluating the \n\neffectiveness of protection provided from existing MPAs or forecasting their optimal \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\ndesigns. Even more striking is the general lack of information about the protection \n\noffered by MPAs to target species in terms of exposure to nearby fisheries. \n\nMPA assessment \n\nThe assessment of MPAs has come a long way from the mostly qualitative early studies \n\nwith poorly replicated designs and inappropriate statistical methods. More recently, \n\nstudies carried out with appropriate experimental designs that include replicated \n\ncontrols have become common (Claudet &amp; Guidetti 2010). Nevertheless, some authors \n\nargue that, in most cases, MPA evaluation has been undertaken without the use of \n\nappropriate sampling designs that enable scientists to unambiguously detect changes \n\nin species abundance and/or biomass (Fraschetti et al. 2002, Guidetti 2002, Claudet &amp; \n\nGuidetti 2010).  \n\nAmongst the different statistical approaches, the before-after control-impact (BACI) \n\nand the beyond BACI designs (Underwood 1991, 1994, Smith 2002) are considered \n\nsome of the best to infer on MPAs effects (Fraschetti et al. 2002, Guidetti 2002). These \n\nmethods and some of their variations, such as after control impact, have been used \n\nregularly in recent studies on the effects of MPA (e.g. Cole et al. 2011, Moland et al. \n\n2011, Bertocci et al. 2012, Horta e Costa et al. 2013).  \n\nRegardless of the existence of positive effects after the implementation of an MPA, \n\nthere are some aspects that should be taken in consideration and objectively \n\ndiscussed, such as the temporal scale of sampling and the enforcement/compliance \n\nlevel of the management rules. The very high natural variability of marine ecosystems \n\nand the difficulties to fully understand it make it even more difficult to discern \n\nstochastic effects from those of the protection given by MPAs. Therefore, the temporal \n\nscale of sampling should, ideally, be large enough to accommodate the natural \n\nfluctuations in species\u2019 abundance, as several factors beyond fishing mortality may \n\nhave a large effect on species\u2019 reproductive success (Guidetti 2002). The level of \n\ncompliance of the management rules may also have an important role. When there is \n\nno compliance then no protection effects are to be expected since there is no effective \n\nchange in fishing pressure. As an example, Lipej et al. (2003) suggested that the lack of \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\ndifferences in fish diversity and abundance between protected and unprotected areas \n\nin Slovenia is due to the lack of enforcement. \n\nAcoustic telemetry is one of the most commonly used tools to investigate fish home \n\nrange areas, site fidelity and movement patterns (Abecasis &amp; Erzini 2008, Abecasis et \n\nal. 2009, March et al. 2010, Mason &amp; Lowe 2010, Afonso et al. 2011, Abecasis et al. \n\n2013). The use of passive acoustic telemetry, where acoustic receivers are placed in \n\nthe marine environment to detect individuals tagged with acoustic transmitters, allows \n\nlong term studies on animal movements in the wild without influencing their behavior \n\n(Heupel et al. 2006, Koeck et al. 2013b).  \n\nSpecies distribution models (SDM) are extremely valuable tools for the implementation \n\nand management of MPAs (Leathwick et al. 2008, Carvalho et al. 2010). There are \n\nseveral approaches to obtain these models including generalized linear or additive \n\nmodels (GLMs or GAMs), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), boosted \n\nregression trees and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) (Elith &amp; Leathwick 2009, \n\nNewbold 2009). The low data requirements and the ease of integration with GIS \n\nanalysis together with its superior performance have made Maxent one of the most \n\nwidely used software for SDM (Elith et al. 2006, Elith &amp; Leathwick 2009).  \n\nThe use of software that assists in the implementation phase of MPAs, especially in the \n\nlocation, size and design process is becoming more frequent (Loos 2006, Green et al. \n\n2009, Allnutt et al. 2012, Ban et al. 2013). In most cases these tools provide managers \n\nwith options based on a wide variety of input data which can include physical, \n\nbiological and socio-economical information. Among the most used conservation \n\nplanning software is Marxan. It uses simulated annealing to create near optimal \n\nsolutions for reserve systems that achieve determined conservation targets while \n\nminimizing the cost (e.g. fisheries effort or catch, socio-economic costs) of including \n\nthese areas in no-take areas. Marxan is the most widely used software due to its ability \n\nto include different types of data and the easy connection with geographic information \n\nsystems (GIS).  \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\nStudy Area - The Luiz Saldanha Marine Park \n\n \n\nThe Arr\u00e1bida coast, located in the metropolitan area of Lisbon and near the Sado \n\nestuary, is in high demand by various marine-related sectors, from nautical leisure \n\nactivities to fishing and shellfish harvesting. This area is in a transitional biogeographic \n\nzone where many species of cold and warm-water affinities reach their southern and \n\nnorthern limits of distribution, respectively (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2003). With more than \n\n1200 registered species it is a European hotspot of marine biodiversity (Saldanha 1974, \n\nHenriques et al. 1999, Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2003). Moreover, the nearby Sado estuary is \n\nknown as an important nursery area for several fish and cephalopod species (Serrano \n\n1992, Cabral et al. 2007, Neves et al. 2009, Vasconcelos et al. 2010, Vinagre et al. \n\n2010).  \n\nThe conflict between human activities and the natural values of this area has led to the \n\nneed to implement regulations. For this reason, the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) \n\nwas established in 1998, covering approximately 53 km2 and stretching along 38km of \n\ncoastline (Figure 1.1). The LSMP is located in an area of high fishing importance that \n\nencompasses the fishing port of Sesimbra and is close to the fishing port of Set\u00fabal, \n\nupstream in the Sado river estuary. The main objectives of this MPA are to protect the \n\ncoastal biodiversity of this particular area and to promote the sustainability of local \n\nartisanal fisheries and fishers\u2019 livelihoods (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2003).  \n\nThe LSMP is divided into three different protection levels (Figure 1.1): no-take areas \n\nwhere all human activities are prohibited; partially protected (or buffer) areas where \n\nonly the use of octopus traps, jigging and handlines is allowed; and complementary \n\nprotection areas where the use of all traditional fishing gears is allowed for fishing \n\nvessels smaller than 7m. In addition, all fishing vessels need a specific permit to \n\noperate inside the LSMP, spearfishing is prohibited in the entire MPA and recreational \n\nangling is only allowed within the complementary areas. \n\n \n\n\n\n30 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.1. Map with the location of the study area. \n\n \n\nWhile the LSMP was designated in 1998, its final planning design was only achieved in \n\n2005 (Figure 1.2). The LSMP\u2019s regulations were gradually introduced: in August 2006, \n\nthe partially protected area of Portinho da Arr\u00e1bida and the eastern half of the no-take \n\narea were set as a partially protected area; in August 2007 the remaining partially \n\nprotected areas were established and the western half of the no-take area was set as a \n\npartially protected area; by August 2008 the eastern half of the total protection area \n\nbecame a no-take zone; finally in August 2009 the whole total protection area became \n\nregulated as no-take (Figure 1.2). \n\n\n\n31 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. Evolution of the regulations in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park \n\n \n\nObjectives \n\n \n\nThe main objectives of this study are: a) to evaluate the potential of the recently \n\nestablished Luiz Saldanha Marine Park as a management tool for the local populations \n\nof commercially and ecologically important species b) to determine how this potential \n\nvaries with contrasting life history characteristics 3) to assess the extent by which the \n\namount of protection offered by the MPA and the suitability of its current design \n\ninfluence the local management of the three selected species. \n\nWe used a combination of passive acoustic telemetry, experimental fishing, species \n\ndistribution models and conservation planning models to achieve these goals and, in \n\nparticular, to answer the following questions: \n\n\n\n32 \n \n\n1 - What is the size of cuttlefish, Senegalese sole and white seabream home range \n\nareas? \n\n2 - Do these species present site fidelity to the marine reserve? \n\n 3 - Do they favour any particular habitat within the study area? \n\n4 - Is it possible to already detect the effects of the marine reserve implementation on \n\nthe abundance and/or biomass of Senegalese sole or cuttlefish? \n\n5 - Is the actual design of the LSMP appropriate for the protection/management of the \n\nthree selected species?  \n\n6 \u2013 Will changes in the size and location of no-take areas improve the efficiency of the \n\nLSMP? \n\n \n\nStudy species \n\n \n\nMarine reserves should ensure protection for a wide range of species that have \n\ndifferent life history traits and different economic and ecological values, and also that \n\noccupy different trophic levels and environments (Palumbi 2004, Afonso 2007, Claudet \n\net al. 2010). For this reason, this study focuses on three species with contrasting life-\n\nhistory, ecological traits, economic values and resilience: cuttlefish Sepia officinalis \n\n(Linnaeus, 1758), Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis Kaup 1858; and white seabream \n\nDiplodus sargus (Linnaeus, 1758). Given their different characteristics we believe that \n\nthis study is relatively representative in that it allows the perception of MPA benefits \n\nfor a wide range of species. Additionally, despite the large number of studies on MPA \n\nefficiency, the vast majority of these studies focus on reef fish species whereas very \n\nfew have investigated cephalopods or flatfish (Lester et al. 2009, Horta e Costa et al. \n\n2013), as in the case.  \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n \n\nThe cuttlefish \n\nThe cuttlefish is a nekto-benthonic cephalopod that occurs over a wide variety of \n\nbottoms (sand, mud and sea grass beds) between the coastline and approximately 200 \n\nm depth, although it is more abundant in the upper 100m (Guerra 2006). It is found \n\nfrom Northern England to the northwestern coast of Africa including the \n\nMediterranean (Guerra 2006). It is a semelparous (reproducing only once in a lifetime) \n\nfast growing species with a lifetime between 1 and 2 years (Le Goff &amp; Daguzan 1991b). \n\nThese characteristics suggest that this species has high resilience to fishing pressure \n\n(Musick 1999). The first year breeders seem to be more common in the south of their \n\ngeographical distribution, whereas second year breeders constitute the vast majority \n\nof the population around its northern distribution limit (Guerra &amp; Castro 1988, Gauvrit \n\net al. 1997).  \n\nThe first tagging experiments with cuttlefish were carried out in the 1980\u2019s by \n\nEzzeddine-Najai (1997) and by Le Goff &amp; Daguzan (1991a) using plastic fanion tags. In a \n\ntag-recapture study carried in the Gulf of Tunis, all recaptured animals migrated \n\ntowards the shallower coastal areas where the main habitats were sand/mud bottoms \n\nand sea grass beds (Ezzeddine-Najai 1997). During this study, the minimum distance \n\ntravelled by cuttlefish was 4 km in 2 days and the maximum 25 km in 21days \n\n(Ezzeddine-Najai 1997). The maximum period between tagging and recapture was 89 \n\ndays with the cuttlefish covering almost 13.8km (Ezzeddine-Najai 1997). These known \n\nmigrations enable cuttlefish populations to exploit the temporal and spatial variability \n\nof productive systems and fluctuating populations of prey (Rodhouse &amp; Nigmatullin \n\n1996). Royer et al. (2006) suggested that coastal zone management alone is not \n\nsufficient to ensure the sustainable exploitation of cuttlefish due to its high mobility. In \n\nfact, several authors suggest that MPAs should be used in conjunction with traditional \n\nmanagement measures such as gear restrictions, seasonal closures, or catch quotas \n\nespecially when species present high mobility (Allison et al. 1998, Shipp 2003, Hilborn \n\net al. 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n \n\nThe Senegalese sole \n\nThe Senegalese sole is a coastal benthonic fish species that occurs in sandy or muddy \n\nbottoms in depths up to 65m. It is common between the Gulf of Biscay and the coasts \n\nof Senegal but, according to Desaunay et al. (2006), its distribution is expanding north \n\nin the NE Atlantic. There are no studies describing the dispersal or movement patterns \n\nof this species, and the knowledge of its ecology and biology is relatively scarce, with \n\nmost studies focusing on juveniles (e.g. Cabral 2000a, Cabral 2000b, Vinagre et al. \n\n2006, Vinagre et al. 2008). According to Fishbase (Froese &amp; Pauly 2013) this species \n\npresents low resilience to fishing pressure. \n\nThe Senegalese sole is one of the most important flatfish resources for fisheries in \n\nPortugal, yet it has not been properly assessed (Teixeira &amp; Cabral 2009). Nevertheless, \n\nTeixeira &amp; Cabral (2009) concluded that, even though there are no evaluations of \n\nflatfish stock status in Portugal, there is probably overexploitation of these fisheries \n\nresources. In fact, a decreasing trend in the landings per unit effort (LPUE) has been \n\nobserved for the period between 1992 and 2005 (Teixeira &amp; Cabral 2009).  \n\nThe sole fishery is one of the most important for the local artisanal fisheries of \n\nSesimbra and Set\u00fabal, the two most important fishing ports located near the LSMP \n\n(Batista et al. 2009). In addition, the nearby Sado estuary is an important nursery area \n\nfor the Senegalese sole (Cabral 2000a, Vasconcelos et al. 2008), as otolith \n\nmicrochemistry shows that many of the fish caught in coastal waters originate from \n\nthe Sado nursery (Vasconcelos et al. 2011, Tanner et al. 2013).  \n\n \n\nThe white seabream \n\nThe white seabream is a demersal fish species usually found at depths less than 50 m \n\non a variety of sea bottoms, including rocky and sandy bottoms as well as seagrass \n\nbeds. It is one of the most important coastal fish resources in southern European \n\ncountries, where it is mainly targeted by recreational fishermen and small scale \n\nfisheries (FAO 2012). Its age, growth, reproduction and diet have been widely studied \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\n(e.g. Gordoa &amp; Moli 1997, Morato et al. 2003, Figueiredo et al. 2005, Leit\u00e3o et al. 2007, \n\nMouine et al. 2007, Abecasis et al. 2008). Based on the biological parameters obtained \n\nby Abecasis et al. (2008) and Morato et al. (2003) this species presents a medium \n\nresilience to fishing pressure (Musick 1999). In Portugal, where it is a main target \n\nspecies for recreational rod and line anglers (Rangel &amp; Erzini 2007, Veiga et al. 2010), \n\ncommercial landings have been declining since the late 1980\u2019s (Directorate General of \n\nFisheries and Aquaculture).  \n\nA wide variety of studies have focused on the movements, site fidelity and activity \n\npatterns throughout the life-history of the white seabream (Abecasis et al. 2009, \n\nD'Anna et al. 2011, Di Franco et al. 2012, Abecasis et al. 2013, Koeck et al. 2013). These \n\nstudies show that the scale of the dispersion pattern of the white sea bream decreases \n\nwith age: larval dispersion occurs at the scale of 100-200 km; post-settlement \n\ndispersion takes place over distances under 30 km, although a portion of 22% to 50% \n\nof settlers remains in the same area (Di Franco et al. 2012); and adult fish present high \n\nsite fidelity with home ranges between 0.65 and 3.93 km2 (Abecasis et al. 2013).  \n\nThe movement patterns, site fidelity and habitat use of the white seabream have been \n\npreviously described for juveniles in a coastal lagoon (Abecasis et al. 2009) and for \n\nadults around artificial and natural reefs (Lino et al. 2009, D'Anna et al. 2011, Abecasis \n\net al. 2013, Koeck et al. 2013a). The discrepancy in patterns of activity and habitat use \n\nof adult white seabream between some of these studies emphasizes the need for local \n\nstudies. Nevertheless this information suggests that, due to their high site fidelity as \n\nadults and to the dispersal as larvae and post-settlers, white seabream may benefit \n\nfrom the implementation of MPAs. In fact, previous studies on the effectiveness of \n\nMPAs as a fishery management tool suggest that marine reserves may provide long \n\nterm benefits to adjacent local fisheries through the increase of white seabream \n\nproduction (Bennett &amp; Attwood 1991, Lloret &amp; Planes 2003, Tuya et al. 2006, Horta e \n\nCosta et al. 2013). This was also observed for other sparids elsewhere (Bennett &amp; \n\nAttwood 1991,  Willis et al. 2003) \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nThesis structure \n\n \n\nThis thesis comprises 8 chapters. In the first chapter we present an introduction to the \n\nmain topic and an overview of the study area and selected study species. Chapters 2 \n\nthrough 4 focus on the home range, site fidelity and habitat use of each study species \n\nthrough the use of passive acoustic telemetry. Chapter 5 evaluates the effects of the \n\nLSMP on the abundance and biomass of Senegalese sole and cuttlefish, by analyzing \n\ndata from experimental fishing trials. In chapter 6 we present distribution models for \n\neach of the study species estimated through Maxent and determine the size of suitable \n\nareas that provide full protection as well as their exposure to local fisheries. In chapter \n\n7 we analyze different protection scenarios using Marxan to identify the best location, \n\nsize and design of no-take areas in the LSMP. Finally, in chapter 8 we synthesize the \n\nmain findings of this study and present general conclusions and suggestions for future \n\nstudies.\n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAbecasis D, Bentes L, Coelho R, Correia C, Lino PG, Monteiro P, Goncalves JMS, Ribeiro \nJ, Erzini K (2008) Ageing seabreams: A comparative study between scales and otoliths. \nFish Res 89:37-48 \n \n\nAbecasis D, Bentes L, Erzini K (2009) Home range, residency and movements of \nDiplodus sargus and Diplodus vulgaris in a coastal lagoon: Connectivity between \nnursery and adult habitats.

The cuttlefish is one of the \n\nmost important resources for the artisanal fisheries operating in the vicinity of the \n\nrecently established Luiz Saldanha Marine Park. Site fidelity and movement patterns of \n\ncuttlefish in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park were investigated using passive acoustic \n\ntelemetry.  \n\nThe results show that cuttlefish have no site fidelity to the study area. The maximum \n\namount of time a cuttlefish spent inside the monitoring area was 39 days with all other \n\nindividuals remaining less than 15 days. Movements over 15 km towards the nearby \n\nestuary were observed with the direction of the movement being independent of the \n\ntide direction. Although not conclusive, the results suggest that cuttlefish are more \n\nactive during the night time. \n\nThe fact that cuttlefish have low site fidelity inside the reserve and large movements \n\nacross and beyond the study area suggest that small coastal marine reserves such as \n\nthe LSMP are not effective in providing long term protection to cuttlefish populations \n\nand, probably, those of other short-lived, highly mobile cephalopods. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n49 \n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nUnderstanding spatial and temporal movement patterns of marine species is key to \n\nensure their adequate management. This is especially true in the context of marine \n\nprotected areas (MPAs). As tools for the conservation and management of biodiversity \n\nand fisheries, MPAs are increasingly seen as a way of overcoming uncertainty in \n\nfisheries management based on conventional measures (e.g. effort control, size and \n\ngear restrictions). Yet, MPA design itself has also rested upon substantial uncertainty, \n\nmainly because information on the species habitat use and connectivity of their \n\n(sub)populations is generally lacking.  \n\nSeveral authors recognize the need to incorporate specific information such as activity \n\npatterns, residency, habitat use and connectivity of (sub)populations into the design \n\nand planning phases of MPA establishment (e.g. Botsford et al. 2003, Glazer &amp; Delgado \n\n2006). This is considered essential to ensure an appropriate MPA design that \n\nmaximizes its beneficial mechanism operating inside and outside the protected areas \n\n(Gr\u00fcss et al. 2011). However, in most cases, this information is either unavailable or \n\nnot taken into consideration during the design and planning of MPAs. Nevertheless, \n\neven in contexts where MPAs have already been implemented, this information can be \n\nextremely useful as a tool for adaptive management (Grafton &amp; Kompas 2005, \n\nPomeroy et al. 2005). This study aims to evaluate the site fidelity, activity patterns and \n\nhome range of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis in the recently established Luiz Saldanha \n\nMarine Park (LSMP). \n\nThe cuttlefish is one of the main target species of the small-scale fisheries that operate \n\nin the LSMP and the nearby Sado estuary (Serrano 1992, Batista et al. 2009). Previous \n\nstudies on the distribution of cuttlefish for this region suggest a seasonal migration \n\nbetween the two main habitats occupied by the species in the area, as cuttlefish \n\nabundance is higher within the estuary during spring and summer but increases in \n\nnearby coastal waters, where the MPA is located, during autumn and winter (Batista et \n\nal., 2009; Neves et al., 2009). Seasonal migrations of cuttlefish between shallow and \n\ndeeper waters have also been described for other regions (e.g. Wang et al. 2003, \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nGuerra 2006). These migrations can be due to ontogenic related habitat shifts and/or \n\nthe onset of the spawning season, which only occurs once during the lifetime of the \n\ncuttlefish.  \n\nNeves et al. (2009) found that, inside the Sado estuary, the cuttlefish\u2019 spawning period \n\nranges from February to June, whereas Serrano (1992) found mature individuals in \n\ncoastal areas all year round. Both authors suggested a size-related spawning habitat \n\nselection, in which smaller individuals would prefer to spawn inside the estuary while \n\nlarger individuals, which are rarely caught inside the estuary, spawn in adjacent coastal \n\nwaters (Neves et al. 2009). It is therefore possible that such larger and more fecund \n\ncuttlefish may be more site attached, in which case an MPA could provide effective \n\nprotection and have a direct benefit for the reproductive productivity of the local \n\npopulation. The information on the spatial and temporal movement patterns of \n\ncuttlefish that this study aims to unveil will demonstrate the potential of using MPAs \n\nto effectively protect cuttlefish populations. It will also provide valuable insight as to \n\nthe suitability of the LSMP in protecting local cuttlefish populations.  \n\n \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\nStudy area \n\nThis study took place in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), which is located in the \n\nSet\u00fabal Peninsula (Portugal). The LSMP covers an area of approximately 53 km2 and \n\nstretches over 38 km of coastline (Figure 2.1). It includes a narrow stretch of rocky reef \n\nbottom down to depths of about 15 m and a larger stretch of soft substrates (sand and \n\nmud) down to the 100 m bathymetric.  \n\nThree different types of protection zones can be found in the LSMP: no-take, partial \n\nprotection and complementary protection. The no-take zone comprises 4.3 km2 where \n\nno extractive or recreational activities are allowed. Octopus traps and jigs are allowed \n\nwithin the four partial protection zones, which cover a total of 21 km2. Finally, within \n\nthe three complementary protection zones, totalling 28 km2, traditional fishing gears \n\n\n\n51 \n \n\nfor vessels smaller than 7m are allowed, along with recreational angling. In addition, all \n\nfishing vessels need a permit to operate inside the LSMP and spearfishing is prohibited \n\nin all zones. \n\nAcoustic telemetry \n\nTrammel nets, similar to those used by local fishermen, were used to capture \n\ncuttlefish, during the November 2010 experimental fishing campaign (see Chapter 5 \n\nfor more details). Seven cuttlefish were measured and tagged with an acoustic \n\ntransmitter (Vemco, Canada), following an adaptation of the method used by Aitken et \n\nal. (2005). A small (9mm long and 5mm wide) section of stainless steel tube was \n\nattached to each end of the acoustic transmitter, using epoxy resin. The transmitters \n\nwere then screwed into the cuttlebone through the stainless steel tubes. After the \n\nattachment of the transmitter, cuttlefish were released at the site of capture. The \n\nwhole procedure took less than 1 minute. \n\nTwo different transmitter types were used: V7 (7 mm in diameter and 22.5 mm in \n\nlength), with random emission intervals between 30 and 90 seconds and an estimated \n\nlifetime of 95 days, and V9 (9 mm in diameter and 29 mm in length) with random \n\nemission intervals between 15 and 45 seconds and an estimated lifetime of 151 days. \n\nPreliminary tests showed detection ranges of approximately 300 m for V9 transmitters \n\nand 100 m for V7 transmitters.  \n\nThe presence of tagged cuttlefish was monitored through the use of 18 acoustic \n\nreceivers (Vemco VR2 and VR2W) moored in two lined arrays parallel to the coastline \n\n(Figure 2.1). The inner line comprised nine receivers deployed at depths between 8 \n\nand 14 m, thus monitoring both rocky and sandy habitats. The outer line comprised \n\nnine receivers deployed at depths between 17 and 21 m, mainly monitoring muddy \n\nbottoms. The monitoring period lasted from October 27th 2010 to September 15th \n\n2011, outlasting the duration of the acoustic transmitters by more than twice their \n\nexpected lifetime. Six receivers from the outer line and two receivers from the inner \n\nline were lost after the data download that took place on November 17 2010, most \n\nlikely due to illegal fishing activities. The loss of these receivers was noticed during the \n\nfollowing download, which took place in April 2011, and forced a change in the array \n\n\n\n52 \n \n\ndesign thereafter, with the deployment of four new receivers on May 9th 2011 (Figure \n\n2.1). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1. Map of the study area with the location of the acoustic receivers \nshown in the top right panel. Triangles show the initial location of the \nreceivers, squares symbolize receivers that were lost after 17/11/2010 and \nstars the receivers re-deployed on 9/5/2011. The asterisks mark the locations \nwhere cuttlefish were captured and released. \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\nA VUE database (Vemco, Canada) was used to manage acoustic detections. Single \n\ndetections occurring in periods of more than 24h were considered spurious and were \n\nremoved from further analysis (Afonso et al. 2009). Acoustic telemetry data was first \n\nanalysed using Eonfusion software (Myriax, Australia) to visualize movement patterns \n\nof tagged cuttlefish fish inside the monitored area.  \n\nTo evaluate site fidelity two indexes were estimated: a residency index (IR; Abecasis &amp; \n\nErzini 2008) and a detection efficiency index (ID). IR was estimated by dividing the total \n\n\n\n53 \n \n\nnumber of days with detections (Dd) by the number of days between first and last \n\ndetections (Di). ID corresponds to the value of Dd divided by the estimated battery life \n\n(B), that is, the estimated period for which the transmitter would be heard of if it \n\nstayed within receiver range.  \n\nActivity patterns throughout the day were evaluated by binning detections into \n\nassigned periods (day or night), according to the sunrise and sunset time obtained \n\nfrom the Astronomical Applications Department of U.S. Naval Observatory \n\n(http://aa.usno.navy.mil). Chi-square analyses were performed for each fish to test if \n\nthere was a period of the day with a number of detections significantly different from \n\nthe expected (Abecasis &amp; Erzini 2008).  \n\nTo assess home range areas, minimum convex polygons (MCP) were calculated for \n\neach cuttlefish based on the location of the receivers. The MCP is the minimum area \n\nthat encompasses all detections, and is an indicator of the dispersion throughout the \n\nmonitored area (Kernohan et al. 2001). In this study, given the limited habitat coverage \n\nof the array, estimates of MCP were only considered as proxies of the actual home \n\nrange areas. \n\nCentre of activity (COA) positions were estimated for each cuttlefish for 30 minute \n\nperiods using the method described by Simpfendorfer et al. (2002). This method uses \n\npresence data from multiple receivers and converts them into position estimates, \n\nbased on the weighed means of the number of detections at each receiver during a \n\nparticular time period. These COA positions were then used to estimate the total \n\ndistance (TD) travelled and the direction of the movements. Mean travelled distance \n\nper day (MTDD) was obtained by dividing TD by Dd. To determine the influence of the \n\ntidal currents in the direction of the movements of cuttlefish we compared the \n\ndirection of successive COA positions against the direction of the tidal current during \n\nthat period. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\nResults \n\n \n\nFive of the seven acoustically tagged cuttlefish were successfully detected by the \n\nreceiver array up to 37 days after tagging (Table 2.1). Additionally, one of the \n\nundetected cuttlefish (# 1) was recaptured by a recreational fisherman 76 days after \n\ntagging, approximately 15.5 km away from the release location inside the Sado \n\nestuary. This cuttlefish was in good condition and its transmitter was well attached. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1.

Moreover, this also \n\nsuggests that abandonment of the monitored area occurred after a few days of \n\ndetection, which is evidence of low site fidelity (Table 2.2).  \n\n\n\n55 \n \n\nTable 2.2.

Short-term \n\n\u2018home range\u2019 values ranged between 0.26 and 1.26 km2 (Table 2.2). Cuttlefish travelled \n\na minimum mean distance of approximately 2 km per day (Table 2.2). Approximately \n\nhalf of these movements were contrary to the prevailing tidal current direction (48.6% \n\nfor #2, 50.5% for #6 and 52.1% for #7). The chi-square analysis revealed that two \n\nanalyzed cuttlefish presented a significantly higher number of detections during the \n\nnight, whereas the third cuttlefish showed no significant difference between the \n\nexpected and the observed number of day and night-time detections (Table 2.2). The \n\nanalysis of the total number of detections of all cuttlefish throughout the 24h of the \n\nday reveals an activity pattern with slightly higher number of detections during the \n\nnight and a relatively lower but more stable number of detections during daytime \n\n(Figure 2.2). \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2.

(2005). These authors found that placing the acoustic transmitter above \n\nthe cuttlebone was more efficient than placing it inside the mantle. This study used a \n\nsimilar method which proved to be adequate, as the recaptured cuttlefish \n\ndemonstrated. \n\nEven though the acoustic receiver array spanned a distance of 5.5 km, the average \n\nnumber of detection days was very low. Moreover, no cuttlefish was ever re-detected \n\nafter leaving the monitored area. The short term individual home range areas obtained \n\nin this study ranged between 0.26 and 1.26 km2 and, although they are 3.5 to 16.5 \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n0:\n00\n\n \n\n1:\n00\n\n \n\n2:\n00\n\n \n\n3:\n00\n\n \n\n4:\n00\n\n \n\n5:\n00\n\n \n\n6:\n00\n\n \n\n7:\n00\n\n \n\n8:\n00\n\n \n\n9:\n00\n\n \n\n10\n:0\n\n0 \n\n11\n:0\n\n0 \n\n12\n:0\n\n0 \n\n13\n:0\n\n0 \n\n14\n:0\n\n0 \n\n15\n:0\n\n0 \n\n16\n:0\n\n0 \n\n17\n:0\n\n0 \n\n18\n:0\n\n0 \n\n19\n:0\n\n0 \n\n20\n:0\n\n0 \n\n21\n:0\n\n0 \n\n22\n:0\n\n0 \n\n23\n:0\n\n0 \n\nPe\nrc\n\nen\nta\n\nge\n o\n\nf t\nhe\n\n to\nta\n\nl n\num\n\nbe\nr \n\nof\n d\n\net\nec\n\nti\non\n\ns \n\nHour of day \n\n\n\n57 \n \n\ntimes smaller than the total protection area, these results are based on a small time \n\nperiod between 14 and 37 days and with limited coverage by the receivers.  \n\nThe loss of several receivers during the experiment does not seem to affect the results \n\nof this study, seeing that most of the tagged cuttlefish detections had stopped before \n\nthat. The only exception was cuttlefish #6, whose detections still occurred after the \n\nloss of some of the receivers. \n\nThe recapture of one cuttlefish 76 days after release inside the nearby estuary (15.5 \n\nkm away) provides direct evidence of migrations between the coastal areas and the \n\nestuary, as previously suggested (Batista et al. 2009, Neves et al. 2009). In fact, \n\ncuttlefish seems to be a very vagile species with no site fidelity, given that all the \n\nindividuals permanently abandoned the monitored area after just a few days. This \n\nsuggests that relatively small MPAs such as the LSMP probably do not provide enough \n\nprotection to this cuttlefish species.  \n\nThe direction of cuttlefish movements, which were up to a minimum of 2km per day, \n\nappears to be independent of the tide direction. As for the activity pattern, a higher \n\nnumber of detections during the night have also been reported for Sepia apama \n\n(Payne et al. 2010) suggesting that enhanced night-time activity may be common \n\namongst cuttlefish species. These results show that cuttlefish have low site fidelity \n\ninside the reserve, and movements substantially larger than the size of the no-take \n\narea and even the marine Park.  \n\nIn order to offer adequate protection, MPAs should include all or, at least, the large \n\nmajority of the individuals\u2019 long term home range (Kramer &amp; Chapman 1999, Kellner et \n\nal. 2008, Moffitt et al. 2009, Afonso et al. 2011), thus ensuring the protection of these \n\nindividuals from fishing for a considerable amount of their life time. However, \n\nprotecting mobile species throughout their lifetime has proved challenging, with \n\nseveral authors acknowledging that, for such species, MPAs do not offer effective \n\nprotection (e.g. Kramer &amp; Chapman 1999, Nowlis &amp; Roberts 1999, Gerber et al. 2003, \n\nAfonso et al. 2009), especially considering the small size of most coastal MPAs. This \n\nseems to be the case of cuttlefish, which are known to perform seasonal migrations \n\nbetween shallow and deeper waters (Wang et al. 2003, Guerra 2006).  \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\nModest size MPAs, such as the majority of NE Atlantic and Mediterranean MPAs \n\n(Claudet et al. 2010), are likely to fail in effectively protecting cuttlefish populations \n\nthroughout their life cycle. Yet, given that this species lays eggs in the substrate, there \n\nis a strong possibility that MPAs may play an important role in protecting the \n\nreproductive output of cuttlefish populations, as long as they encompass (most of) the \n\nspawning grounds of cuttlefish.  \n\nWe recommend that long term monitoring studies be carried out to better understand \n\nthe effects of the LSMP on cuttlefish populations, along with wider scale studies on the \n\nspatial ecology and migration. A wider array of acoustic receivers covering deeper \n\nwaters and the nearby Sado estuary could help clarify the migrations of cuttlefish \n\nacross its natural habitats and, in particular, the location of their spawning grounds. \n\n\n\n59 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAbecasis D, Erzini K (2008) Site fidelity and movements of gilthead sea bream (Sparus \naurata) in a coastal lagoon (Ria Formosa, Portugal).

We conducted long term (up to 293 days) passive acoustic \n\ntelemetry studies in order to determine the site fidelity and movement patterns of this \n\nspecies in a recently established marine protected area (Luiz Saldanha Marine Park, \n\nPortugal). The results revealed that most Senegalese sole spent a large part of the \n\ntime, between first and last detections (average residency index = 69%), inside a \n\nrelatively small area (average 95% KUD = 1.2 km2; LSMP no-take area = 4.3 km2), \n\nduring which they clearly preferred sandy bottoms, the most common habitat inside \n\nthe MPA. Results also demonstrated that Senegalese sole do regular excursions \n\nbeyond MPA boundaries, eventually disappearing from the MPA. The results of this \n\nstudy suggest that small coastal MPAs providing adequate habitat may protect \n\nindividuals of this species, while allowing for moderate levels of adult spillover from \n\nthe MPA to neighbouring areas. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely used as a fishery and biodiversity \n\nmanagement tool (Russ &amp; Alcala 2011). MPAs where extractive human activities are \n\nreduced or excluded can provide a refuge for overexploited populations. In the long \n\n\n\n63 \n \n\nterm, they can also act as sources of emigrant larvae or post-recruit spillover that will \n\nreplenish adjacent (fished) areas (Russ 2002). By continuously protecting individual fish \n\nwithin its boundaries, MPAs are expected to hold larger and older fish, which will reach \n\nhigher reproductive potential and eventually produce offspring with better survival \n\nrates than those from younger fish, thereby benefiting local populations through \n\nenhanced recruitment (Birkeland &amp; Dayton 2005).  \n\nSpillover can take place when the movements of individual fish across the boundaries \n\nof an MPA result in a net emigration of fish to the outside areas, eventually increasing \n\nfisheries yields. This net spillover seems to be density-dependent, as several empirical \n\nstudies demonstrate that it typically occurs in MPAs that hold higher densities than \n\ntheir neighbouring fished areas (e.g. Go\u00f1i et al. 2008, La Mesa et al. 2011, Russ &amp; \n\nAlcala 2011). \n\nIt follows that understanding the habitat use and movement patterns of individual fish \n\nis central to establishing the appropriate size, shape, location and separation of MPAs, \n\nso that they effectively promote the reserve effect and spillover. Moreover, this \n\nknowledge can also provide critical guidelines and input for a posteriori adaptive \n\nmanagement of MPAs (Gerber et al. 2005, Grafton &amp; Kompas 2005, Pomeroy et al. \n\n2005), especially when there was little or no relevant ecological data available in the \n\nfirst place. \n\nThis study aims to shed light on the spatial-temporal movement patterns of a coastal \n\nfish species, the Senegalese sole Solea senegalensis Kaup 1858, within the context of a \n\nrecently established MPA, the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP). The Senegalese sole \n\nis a coastal fish species that inhabits sandy and muddy bottoms at depths down to \n\n100m. Its geographic distribution comprises the NE Atlantic from the Gulf of Biscay to \n\nthe coasts of Senegal, yet it appears to be expanding north (Desaunay et al. (2006). \n\nKnowledge of the ecology and biology of the Senegalese sole is relatively scarce, with \n\nmost studies focusing on its juvenile phase (e.g. Cabral 2000a, Cabral 2000b, Vinagre et \n\nal. 2006, Vinagre et al. 2008). In particular, there are no published studies describing \n\nthe dispersal or movement patterns of this species. \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nThe Senegalese sole is one of the most important species for the artisanal fisheries \n\nthat operate along the Portuguese coast, including those of the Set\u00fabal peninsula, \n\nwhere the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) was recently implemented (Batista et al. \n\n2009). The LSMP is located next to the Sado estuary, which is thought to be an \n\nimportant nursery for many coastal fishes including Senegalese sole (Cabral 2000a, \n\nVasconcelos et al. 2008). Indeed, studies using otolith microchemistry showed that \n\nmany Senegalese soles caught in coastal waters originated from the Sado nursery \n\n(Vasconcelos et al. 2011, Tanner et al. 2013).  \n\nWhile these evidences suggest spatial migrations between the estuary and adjacent \n\ncoastal areas, these are still poorly understood. This study uses passive acoustic \n\ntelemetry to evaluate the size of individual home range areas, site fidelity and patterns \n\nof habitat use of adult Senegalese sole, inside the LSMP. This information will shed \n\nlight on the suitability of the LSMP design for protecting local populations of \n\nSenegalese sole. \n\n \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\nStudy area \n\nThe LSMP, located in the Set\u00fabal Peninsula (Portugal), covers an area of approximately \n\n53 km2 and stretches over 38 km of coastline (Figure 3.1). It includes a narrow stretch \n\nof rocky reef habitats down to 15 m deep and a larger stretch of soft substrates (sand \n\nand mud) habitats down to 100 m. The LSMP is located in an area of high importance \n\nto commercial fishing activities, as it encompasses the fishing port of Sesimbra and is \n\nclose to the nearby fishing port of Set\u00fabal, located upstream in the Sado river estuary \n\n(Figure 3.1). \n\nThis MPA was designated in 1998, yet its final planning design was only finalized in \n\n2005 and full implementation of regulations was only accomplished in 2009. The LSMP \n\ndesign includes one no-take zone of 4.3 km2 where all extractive activities are \n\nforbidden, four partial protection zones totalling 21 km2 where only commercial fishing \n\n\n\n65 \n \n\nusing octopus traps and jigs is allowed), and three complementary protection zones \n\ntotalling 28 km2 where recreational angling and commercial fishing boats less than 7m \n\nlong are allowed to operate using traditional fishing gear (Figure 3.1a). Additional \n\nregulations include the ban on spearfishing in the entire LSMP area and a tight control \n\nover fishing access, as all commercial fishing vessels require a permit to operate within \n\nthe LSMP limits.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1. Study area with the location of the acoustic receivers. Triangles \nshow the initial location of the receivers, squares symbolize receivers that \nwere lost after 17/11/2010 and stars stand for new receivers deployed on \n9/5/2011. The asterisks identify Senegalese sole capture and release locations. \nThe red area corresponds to the no-take area, the orange area represents the \npartial protection area and the green area shows the complementary \nprotection area. \n\n \n\nTagging and monitoring \n\nSeventeen Senegalese sole over 30cm TL were captured, measured and tagged during \n\nthe experimental trammel net fishing campaign of October 2010 (see Chapter 5 for \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\nmore details). Eleven were captured in the no-take area with the remaining six \n\ncaptured in the partially protected area located east of the no-take area (Figure 3.1b). \n\nAccording to Teixeira &amp; Cabral (2010) all tagged fish should correspond to mature \n\nindividuals between 3 and 8 years old. \n\nAcoustic transmitters (Vemco V9-2L) were externally attached on the eyed side \n\nunderneath the dorsal fin (median region). The acoustic transmitters were previously \n\nglued, together with two nylon sutures 1 cm apart, to a smooth rubber plate. The \n\nsutures were then passed through the muscle underneath the pterigiophores of the \n\ndorsal fin and another rubber plate was placed on the opposite side (blind side) where \n\nthreads were knotted (Figure 3.2). This tagging procedure was similar to that used by \n\nB\u00e9gout Anras et al. (2003) for Solea solea. After the attachment of the acoustic \n\ntransmitter, fish were released at the site of capture.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2. Pictures of a Senegalese sole with an acoustic transmitter attached. \n\n \n\nEighteen acoustic receivers (Vemco VR2 and VR2W) monitored the presence of tagged \n\nSenegalese sole. These receivers were moored in an array that comprised two lines of \n\nreceivers parallel to the coastline that covered the no-take area and one neighbouring \n\npartial protection zone (Figure 3.1b). These lines, which had nine receivers each, were \n\ndeployed so as to cover depths from 8 and 14 m (inner line), and 17 to 21 m (outer \n\nline). The monitoring period lasted from October 2010 until January 2012, outlasting \n\nthe expected lifetime of the acoustic tags (282 days). Six receivers from the outer line \n\n\n\n67 \n \n\nand two receivers from the inner line were lost following the first data download that \n\ntook place on November 17 2010, most probably due to illegal fishing activity. The loss \n\nof these receivers was noticed during the second data download that was carried out \n\nin April 2011, leading to the deployment of four new receivers in slightly different \n\nlocations in May 2011 (Figure 3.1b). Tag performance tests were carried out before the \n\nrelease of tagged animals. These tests showed detection ranges of approximately 300 \n\nm and no significant differences between the number of observed and expected \n\ndetections during day and night (?2= 1.47 p=0.22). \n\n \n\nData analysis \n\nWe used a VUE database (Vemco, Canada) to manage acoustic detections. Single \n\ndetections occurring in periods of more than 24h were considered spurious and were \n\nremoved from further analysis (Afonso et al. 2009). Acoustic telemetry data was first \n\nanalysed using Eonfusion software (Myriax, Australia) to visualize movement patterns \n\nof tagged Senegalese soles inside the monitored area.  \n\nHome range areas were estimated using two different methods: minimum convex \n\npolygons (MCP) and kernel utilization distributions (KUD). MCPs were estimated as the \n\nminimum area that encompassed all detections and represent a measure of dispersion \n\nover the monitored area used by an animal (Kernohan et al. 2001). The KUDs were \n\nestimated based on centre of activity positions (COA). These COA were estimated for \n\neach fish for 30 minute periods using the method described by Simpfendorfer et al. \n\n(2002). This method uses presence data from multiple receivers and converts them \n\ninto position estimates based on weighed means of the number of detections at each \n\nreceiver during a particular time period. A 50% KUD area was used as measure of the \n\nindividual\u2019s core activity area, and a 95% KUD area as the individual\u2019s home range area \n\n(Afonso et al. 2008). Both MCPs and KUDs were estimated using Hawth\u2019s Analysis \n\nTools extension for ArcGIS (Beyer 2004). A smoothing factor of 250 and 25m grid cells \n\nwere used for KUD estimation. Correlations between fish total length and home ranges \n\nareas (MCP, 50% KUD and 95% KUD) were assessed using the Pearson correlation \n\ncoefficient (Pearson\u2019s r). \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\nTo measure site fidelity, two indices were estimated for each individual: a residence \n\nindex (IR), corresponding to the total number of days a fish was detected (Dd) divided \n\nby the number of days between the date of release and the last detection (Di) (Afonso \n\net al.  2008), and a weighted residence index (IWR) (Lino 2012), which accounts for the \n\nnumber of days the fish was detected (Dd) as a proportion of the total number of \n\nmonitoring days (Dt), and is weighted by the interval in days between first and last \n\ndetection (Di) as a proportion of the total number of monitoring days (Dt),  \n\n \n\nt\n\ni\n\nt\n\nd\nwr D\n\nD\nD\nD\n\nI \u00d7=\n \n\n \n\nThis index was used to account for the long monitoring periods when compared with \n\nthe expected tag lifetime. Therefore, the total number of monitoring days (Dt) was \n\nreplaced by the tag expected lifetime. Both indices vary between 0 (no residency) and \n\n1 (full time resident).  \n\nWhenever there were more than 22 days with detections and more than 2500 \n\ndetections in total Fast Fourier Transformations (FFT) were applied to the hourly \n\nnumber of fish detections in all receivers to detect diel activity patterns (Abecasis et al. \n\n2013). The FFT decomposes a sequence of values into components of different \n\nfrequencies. The frequencies of dominant cyclical patterns are then identifiable as \n\npeaks within a frequency power spectrum (Chatfield 2004). Activity patterns \n\nthroughout the day were evaluated by binning detections into assigned periods (day or \n\nnight), according to the time of sunrise and sunset time as identified by the \n\nAstronomical Applications Department of U.S. Naval Observatory \n\n(http://aa.usno.navy.mil). A chi-square analysis was performed for each fish to test if \n\nthere is a period of the day with a number of detections significantly different from the \n\nexpected (Abecasis &amp; Erzini 2008).  \n\nTo test for habitat selection, each COA was assigned as pertaining to one of the five \n\navailable habitat types (fine sand, medium sand, coarse sand, rock and nearshore \n\n\n\n69 \n \n\nreefs). We then used chi-squares tests to assess if fish used habitats differently than \n\nexpected based on habitat availability (Rogers &amp; White 2007). First, we calculated the S \n\nstatistic \n\n? = ?  \n?\n\n?=1\n\n?\n???? ? ???+??\n\n2\n\n???+?\n\n?\n\n?=1\n\n \n\nwhere pi is the proportion of available habitat i and uij, for 1?j?J and 1?i?I, the number \n\nof detections for animal j in habitat i. Under the hypothesis of random habitat use by \n\nall animals this test follows the chi-square distribution with J(I-1) degrees of freedom. \n\nAdditionally, the hypothesis of equal habitat selection for all individuals was tested by \n\na chi-square test on the contingency table containing the uij values, such as \n\n?? = ?  \n?\n\n?=1\n\n?\n???? ? ??+?+??\n\n2\n\n??+?+?\n\n?\n\n?=1\n\n \n\nThe result was compared with a chi-square distribution with (I-1) (J-1) degrees of \n\nfreedom. Moreover, we estimated selection ratios (?ij=\n???\n\n?+???\n) to measure individual \n\nhabitat selection (Rogers &amp; White 2007). The selection ratio (?) is a measure that \n\nrefers to the selection of the relocations within the study area (Manly et al. 2002). \n\nValues above 1 indicate preference, values below 1 indicate avoidance. An \n\neigenanalysis of selection ratios was performed to understand the individual \n\nheterogeneity of habitat selection (Calenge &amp; Dufour 2006). All habitat selection \n\nanalyses were performed using the adehabitatHS package for R (Calenge 2006). \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\nThe number of days in which individual tagged  Senegalese sole were detected ranged \n\nfrom 5 to 213 days, corresponding to total periods of detection ranging from 5 to 293 \n\ndays (Figure 3.3), and to a total number of detections per fish that range from 282 to \n\n168133 (Table 3.1). \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3. Calendar plot of daily detections of Senegalese sole tagged with \nacoustic transmitters. \n\n \n\nAbout 70% of tagged Senegalese sole presented a IR above 0.5, which suggests that \n\nthese fish spent more than half of the detection period within the monitored area \n\n(Table 3.1). Conversely, only 2 (<12%) tagged fish had IWR values above 0.5, indicating \n\nthat very few individuals were detected for over half the days of expected tag lifetime \n\n(Table 3.1). Such low IWR also suggests that various fish had long detection periods but \n\nonly some days with detections in between. It is also noteworthy that, 52% of \n\nindividuals were no longer detected after just a few days of consecutive detections \n\n(Figure 3.3). A significant correlation was found between fish total length and IR (r=-\n\n0.501, p=0.04), indicating that larger fish spent less time in the monitored area. \n\n \n\n \n\n0 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n\n10 \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n\n23-10-2010 12-12-2010 31-01-2011 22-03-2011 11-05-2011 30-06-2011 19-08-2011 \n\nFi\nsh\n\n ID\n \n\nDate \n\n\n\n71 \n \n\nTable 3.1.

In contrast, the closest flatfish species present in the study area \u2013 \n\nthe common sole Solea solea (Cabral et al. 2007), has been shown to be more active \n\nduring night-time. This different behavior may assure that interspecific competition is \n\navoided or might be related with fish size, since the common sole individuals tagged in \n\nprevious studies were smaller than the Senegalese sole individuals tagged in this study. \n\nThe lower number of night-time detections may be caused by fish burrowing in the \n\nsand. This would reduce the transmitters\u2019 range, in a similar way to what was observed \n\nin other studies (Abecasis et al. 2013).  \n\nOur results seem to indicate that some individuals exhibit high site fidelity while the \n\nmajority is more transient. The low IR values for individuals whose detection period \n\nspanned over 100 days suggest that movements out of the monitored area occur on a \n\nfrequent basis and sometimes for prolonged periods. As these periods occurred in-\n\nbetween detections, these individuals abandoned the monitored area and later \n\nreturned to it. In contrast, individuals that were detected for fewer days spent the \n\nmajority of the time inside the monitored area. Thus, low IWR values can be divided in \n\ntwo main groups: 1) fish that were detected over short periods of time and never \n\ndetected again (e.g. # 4, # 10 and # 15) and 2) fish with a long period of time between \n\nfirst and last detections but only some days with detections in between (e.g. # 2, # 3 \n\nand # 13).  \n\nThe first group is most likely composed of fish that performed movements leading to \n\nspillover (permanent relocation of home range area outside the MPA) to adjacent \n\nareas where they can eventually be captured. This was confirmedly what happened to \n\nfish # 11. Another possibility is that (some) fish suffered post release mortality. \n\nHowever, two tagged soles (#11 and #13) were recaptured almost one year after \n\n\n\n79 \n \n\ntagging in apparent good condition, suggesting that post release mortality is low. \n\nExcept for some scale loss around the point of contact these fish were in good \n\ncondition showing no sign of infection and the acoustic transmitters were still properly \n\nattached. \n\nThe second group is composed of fish that moved outside the monitored area but \n\nultimately came back, an event described as leakage, where temporary movements \n\nbeyond the MPA boundaries are part of the home range movements (P\u00e9rez-Ruzafa et \n\nal. 2008). Although the monitored array only covered part of the LSMP the fact that 2 \n\nindividuals were captured outside this MPA strengthens this hypothesis. Another \n\npossibility is that the monitored area represents only a part of a larger home range \n\nthat is seasonally visited. However, if this is the case there seems to be no common \n\ntemporal trend among fish in such movements. \n\nOverall, our results indicate that larger fish have less site fidelity to the monitored area \n\nand, therefore, should use areas outside the detection range more often. Larger fish \n\nmay move over larger areas due to a combination of enhanced exploring capabilities \n\nand a size-related increase of energetic needs demanding more captured prey. Rogers \n\n(1994) has shown that the geographic range of the common sole (Solea solea) \n\nincreases with its abundance so that individuals may search for new feeding grounds, a \n\nbehavioural response known as density dependent movements (Kellner et al. 2008). \n\nAnother hypothesis could be the existence of a social/sex component similar to what \n\nhas been reported for other flatfish species that exhibit complex haremic territorial \n\nsystems. In several Bothidae species adult males defend territories that include several \n\nsmaller female territories (Konstantinou &amp; Shen 1995, Carvalho et al. 2003). \n\nThe preference of adult Senegalese sole for medium sandy habitats found in our study \n\ncontrasts with the preference of juveniles for mud sediments as reported for the \n\nnearby Sado estuary (Cabral 2000a). This change in habitat preferences is somewhat \n\nexpected given the ontogenic shifts and the change in prey preference with age \n\n(Garcia-Franquesa et al. 1996, Cabral 2000b).  \n\n \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\nConclusions \n\nAccording to our results, the \u2018impact\u2019 area of the LSMP (no-take and partial protection \n\nareas) is large enough to provide protection to individual Senegalese sole, as it \n\nrepresents approximately eleven times the largest individual long-term home range. \n\nMoreover, a large part of the no-take and partial protection areas holds the preferred \n\nhabitat of adult Senegalese sole. In addition, spillover and leakage events, which are \n\none of the supposed benefits of MPAs to local fisheries, seem common (P\u00e9rez-Ruzafa \n\net al. 2008, Russ &amp; Alcala 2011). On the other hand, the size of the \u2018impact\u2019 area may \n\nnot be enough to offer protection to more than a few individuals due to density-\n\ndependent movements or if this species presents a social system similar to that \n\npresent in several Bothidae species. Therefore, future studies focusing on the social \n\nand reproductive behaviour of this species are needed in order to better clarify our \n\nfindings. \n\n \n\n\n\n81 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAbecasis D, Bentes L, Lino PG, Santos MN, Erzini K (2013) Residency, movements and \nhabitat use of adult white sea bream (Diplodus sargus) between natural and artificial \nreefs.

The number of days between first and last detections ranged between 2 and \n\n293 with most individuals presenting high site fidelity. The results show a cyclical 24 \n\nhour pattern of activity with most individuals being more active during the day with an \n\nincrease in the number of detections after sunrise and a decrease just before sunset. A \n\npositive correlation was found between fish total length and the maximum range. \n\nHowever, the maximum range observed was 5 km and the average was 2.36 km \n\nindicating that even large fish occupy relatively small areas. The results of this study \n\nsuggest that white seabream might benefit from the implementation of small coastal \n\nMPAs such as the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nUnderstanding the activity patterns and residency of marine species is a fundamental \n\naspect towards their proper management. With the onset of marine protected areas \n\n(MPAs) as a tool for conservation and management of biodiversity and fisheries this \n\ninformation has become even more necessary. Several authors acknowledge that \n\ninformation on species movements, site fidelity and habitat use should be taken in \n\nconsideration during the design phase of MPAs (e.g. Botsford et al. 2003, Glazer &amp; \n\n\n\n87 \n \n\nDelgado 2006). However, in most cases, this information is either unavailable or not \n\ntaken in consideration during the design of MPAs. This information is extremely useful \n\neven after the implementation of MPAs as a tool for adaptive management (Grafton &amp; \n\nKompas 2005, Pomeroy et al. 2005).  \n\nDuring the recent implementation of the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), a small \n\ncoastal MPA with different protection levels, located in the vicinity of two large fishing \n\nharbours (Set\u00fabal and Sesimbra), no information on the activity patterns and residency \n\nof some of the most important species for the local small scale artisanal fisheries was \n\navailable. The main goals of this MPA are to protect the local high biodiversity and also \n\nto promote the sustainability of local artisanal fisheries. \n\nThe white seabream, Diplodus sargus (Linnaeus, 1758), is one of the most important \n\ncoastal fish resources in southern European countries and one of the main target \n\nspecies for recreational anglers (Veiga et al. 2010). According to Horta e Costa et al. \n\n(2013) the white seabream is one of the most landed reef fish species in the port of \n\nSesimbra while also attaining one of the highest values per kg.  \n\nThe movement and activity patterns, habitat use and site fidelity have been widely \n\nstudied in adults and juveniles of white seabream using tag-recapture and acoustic \n\ntransmitters (Abecasis et al. 2009, Lino et al. 2009, D'Anna et al. 2011, Abecasis et al. \n\n2013, Koeck et al. 2013a). With the exception of juveniles that migrate from an \n\nestuarine environment to coastal areas (Abecasis et al. 2009) white seabream \n\ndemonstrate high site fidelity (D'Anna et al. 2011, Abecasis et al. 2013). The size of the \n\naverage home range areas of adult white seabream ranged between 0.11 km2 in the \n\nMediterranean and 1.88 km2 in the South of Portugal (D'Anna et al. 2011, Abecasis et \n\nal. 2013). Different activity patterns have also been reported for this species. The study \n\nby D\u2019Anna et al. (2011) revealed that white seabream were more active during the \n\nnight while the study by Abecasis et al. (2013) showed that white seabream were more \n\nactive during the day. The observed diversity in activity patterns and on the size of \n\nhome range areas enforces the need for local studies particularly in MPAs (Abecasis et \n\nal. 2012).  \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nThe objectives of this study were to determine the site fidelity, activity patterns and \n\nhome range areas for white seabream in the LSMP. This information is then used to \n\ndiscuss the usefulness of the LSMP towards the management of the local white \n\nseabream population. \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\n \n\nStudy area \n\nThis study took place in the LSMP, a 53 km2 marine reserve that stretches over 38 km \n\nof coastline. With only a narrow rocky reef from the coastline down to 15m deep the \n\nvast majority of its bottom is composed of soft substrates (Figure 4.1). This MPA \n\ncomprises 3 different protection levels: one no-take zone of approximately 4.2 km2 \n\nwhere all human activities except research and monitoring are banned; four partially \n\nprotected areas where only octopus traps and jigs are allowed at more than 200m \n\nfrom the shoreline and three complementary protection areas where traditional \n\nfishing gears are allowed for vessels smaller than 7m. Recreational angling is only \n\npermitted in complementary areas and spearfishing is prohibited in the entire LSMP. \n\nThe monitored area consisted of approximately 4.8 km of coastline covered by an \n\narray of 11 eleven acoustic receivers (VR2 and VR2W, Vemco) placed in a line parallel \n\nto the coast (Figure 4.1). \n\nTagging and monitoring \n\nFish were captured using hook and line baited with shrimp. Twenty white seabream \n\nwere fitted with an acoustic transmitter. All transmitters had an emission rate \n\nbetween 30-90 seconds with exception of 4 transmitters which had a 15-45 seconds \n\ninterval. Two different transmitter sizes were used, V7 and V9 (Vemco) with an \n\nexpected lifetime of 95 and 282 days respectively. The transmitters with the higher \n\nrate of emission (V9; 15-45s) had an expected lifetime of 151 days. Acoustic \n\ntransmitters were introduced in the coelomic cavity through a 1cm incision made in \n\nthe ventral line between the insertion of the pectoral fins and the anus following the \n\n\n\n89 \n \n\nprocedures described in Abecasis &amp; Erzini (2008). After introducing the transmitter, \n\nthe incision was closed using cyanoacrilate tissue adhesive (Vetseal, BBraun). \n\nPreliminary tests showed detection ranges of approximately 300 m for V9 transmitters \n\nand 100 m for V7 transmitters. Fish were released in the same location where they \n\nwere captured as soon as they recovered from surgery (approximately 15 minutes). \n\nTagged fish ranged between 20 and 37 cm in total length (TL) which correspond to fish \n\nbetween 3 and 13 years old (Abecasis et al. 2008).   \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1. Map of the study area with the location of the acoustic receivers. \n\n \n\nMonitoring of tagged fish was made through an array of 11 acoustic receivers located \n\nparallel to the coastline around 10m deep. Although the monitoring period lasted from \n\n1 May 2011 until 2 July 2013, receiver H was nonoperational from 24 December 2012. \n\nOn average, the receivers were cleaned from incrusting algae and fauna, and data was \n\ndownloaded every 3 months. \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\nData analysis \n\nDetections of tagged white seabream were managed using the VUE database (Vemco). \n\nThe site fidelity was analysed by using two different indices, the residency index (IR) \n\nproposed by Afonso et al. (2008) and the weighted residency index (IWR) proposed by \n\nLino (2012). The IR was estimated by dividing the total number of days a fish was \n\ndetected by the number of days between the date of release and the last detection. \n\nThis index was estimated for each receiver and for the entire array. The IWR takes in \n\nconsideration the duration of the transmitter expected lifetime (or study duration) and \n\nfollows the formula \n\nt\n\ni\n\nt\n\nd\nwr D\n\nD\nD\nD\n\nI \u00d7=\n \n\nwhere Dd is the total number of days a fish was detected, Di is the number of days \n\nbetween first and last detections and Dt is the expected duration of the acoustic \n\ntransmitter or study duration whatever is shorter. Both these indices vary between 0 \n\n(no residency) and 1 (full time resident).  \n\nHome range areas were calculated using the kernel utilization distribution (KUD). The \n\nKUD is a two dimensional probabilistic function that estimates the area of probability \n\nof finding a fish (Worton 1989). The KUDs were estimated based on centre of activity \n\npositions (COA). These COA were estimated for each fish for 30 minute periods using \n\nthe method described by Simpfendorfer et al. (2002). This method uses presence data \n\nfrom multiple receivers and converts them to position estimates based on weighed \n\nmeans of the number of detections at each receiver during a particular time period. A \n\n50% KUD was used as the core activity area and a 95% KUD as the home range area \n\n(Abecasis et al. 2013). We used 25 x 25 m cell grids and a smoothing factor (h) of 250 \n\nto estimate KUD with Hawth\u2019s analysis tools for ArcGIS. Because acoustic receivers \n\nwere displayed parallel to the coastline the maximum range length between the \n\nacoustic receivers where fish were detected was also estimated in order to better \n\nunderstand the dispersion along the coast. The Pearson correlation coefficient was \n\nused to examine the relationship between fish total length and 50% and 95% KUD, IR \n\nand IWR. \n\n\n\n91 \n \n\nTo investigate possible diel patterns, detections were separated by day/night time for \n\neach individual fish. Sunrise and sunset times obtained from the United States Naval \n\nObservatory (http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php) were used to \n\ndetermine the boundaries of the diel intervals. A chi-square test was then used to test \n\nfor differences in the number of detections between day and night time (Abecasis &amp; \n\nErzini 2008). \n\nFast Fourier Transformations (FFT) was applied to the hourly number of detections of \n\neach fish to examine diel detection patterns. Only individuals that were detected more \n\nthan 22 days and had more than 2500 detections in total were analyzed. The FFT \n\ndecomposes a sequence of values into components of different frequencies. The \n\nfrequencies of dominant cyclical patterns are then identifiable as peaks within a \n\nfrequency power spectrum (Chatfield 2004). \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\nThe detection period of tagged white seabream, between first and last detection, \n\nranged between 2 and 293 days with most fish being detected close to or even more \n\nthan the expected lifetime of the transmitter (Figure 4.2). The high values of the IR and \n\nIWR observed for most individuals indicate that white seabream have strong site fidelity \n\nto the monitored area (Table 4.1). The fact that for most fish the highest IR is observed \n\nfor the receiver closest to the tagging location reinforces the high site fidelity (Table \n\n4.2). The dispersion along the coast was also short with most fish covering a stretch of \n\ncoastline around 2 km long. Only two fish (# 5 and 8) were detected in ten or more \n\nreceivers which correspond to a stretch of coastline around 5 km. The 95% KUD ranged \n\nbetween 0.43 and 1.56 km2 (0.77 km2 average) whereas the 50% KUD ranged between \n\n0.13 and 0.41 km2 (0.18 km2 average) (Table 4.1). The number of detections was \n\nsignificantly higher during the day for all fish with exception of fish #16 and 19 which \n\nwere detected more frequently during the night-time (Table 4.1). The FFT analysis \n\nrevealed a 24h activity pattern for all analyzed fish except #15 that showed no pattern. \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\nAdditionally, fish #5, 7, 12, 13, 16 and 18 presented additional activity peaks at 48h \n\nand fish #8 and 18 also at 72h.  \n\nThe Pearson correlation revealed a positive correlation between TL and maximum \n\nrange (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.48, p=0.044) and between fish TL and IWR (Pearson\u2019s r = 0.45, \n\np=0.048). No significant correlations were found between TL and 50% KUD, 95% KUD \n\nor IR.  \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\n \n\nAlthough several studies have already been published on the movement patterns, \n\nhome range and site fidelity of white seabream (Abecasis et al. 2009, D'Anna et al. \n\n2011, Abecasis et al. 2013) the differences observed between them support the need \n\nfor local studies. Knowledge of local populations\u2019 habits and needs are especially \n\nrelevant for the establishment of marine reserves and their adaptive management \n\n(Grafton &amp; Kompas 2005, Kaiser 2011). Therefore, the results of this study provide not \n\nonly information on the species movements but are also particularly useful for the \n\nadaptive management of the LSMP.  \n\n\n\n93 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2.

Moreover, a recent study by Koeck et al. (2013b) \n\nrevealed that the implantation of an acoustic transmitter in the abdominal cavity of \n\nwhite seabream does not influence their survival or behaviour.  \n\nThe observed 24h diel pattern of activity with significantly more detections during the \n\nday is in accordance with the observations in the South of Portugal (Abecasis et al. \n\n2013) and with the results of white seabream inhabiting natural reefs (Koeck et al. \n\n2013a). These results are consistent with the findings of Figueiredo et al. (2005) that \n\nshow a higher feeding activity during the day. On the contrary, it contrasts with the \n\nresults of white seabream inhabiting artificial reefs where this species was found more \n\nactive during the night (D\u2019Anna et al. 2011, Koeck et al. 2013a). These contrasting \n\nresults suggest that white seabream can easily adapt their diel behaviour pattern \n\naccording to the habitat and its specifications. \n\nThe average size of the home range areas found in this study is less than half of the \n\naverage size found by Abecasis et al. (2013). This could be due to habitat differences \n\nsince the study of Abecasis et al. (2013) took place in a set of artificial and natural reefs \n\nsurrounded by sandy bottoms whereas this study took place in a stretch of rocky \n\ncoastline that extends for over 20 km providing adequate food resources and plenty of \n\nrefuges. Moreover, this study took place in a marine reserve whereas in the study area \n\nof Abecasis et al. (2013) took place in an area were both recreational and commercial \n\nfishing are allowed. A recent study on the sparid Pagrus auratus (Parsons et al. 2010) \n\nhas shown differences on home range size between individuals from the marine \n\nreserve and individuals from outside the reserve. Parsons et al. (2010) suggest that \n\nindividuals with small home ranges centered within the reserve will not often cross the \n\nreserve boundaries and therefore will be less likely to be captured by fishing. This \n\nwould lead to a different selection pressure favouring individuals with smaller home \n\nrange areas. Given the low age of the LSMP it is unlikely that this effect is already \n\ntaking place however, future studies should investigate this possibility. \n\n\n\n99 \n \n\nWhen compared with the home range areas observed by D\u2019Anna et al. (2011) our \n\nvalues were considerably higher. However, the monitoring period of our study was \n\nmuch longer (maximum of 48 vs 293 days of monitoring) and our fish were also bigger.  \n\nThe fact that no significant correlations were found between fish TL and 95% or 50% \n\nKUD might indicate that adult white seabream do not use larger areas as they grow. \n\nYet, larger individuals appear to roam over larger stretches of coastline as indicated by \n\nthe positive correlation found between fish TL and the maximum range length. \n\nGiven that white seabream show high site fidelity and home range areas which are \n\nabout 5.5 times smaller than the no-take area, it is feasible that the LSMP can have an \n\nimportant role in this species\u2019 local management. The results of the experimental \n\nfishing trials (Cunha et al. 2011) and of this study suggest that white seabream \n\nmovements do not extend far away from rocky bottoms. In fact, the previous study by \n\nAbecasis et al. (2013) has also shown the white seabream preference for rocky \n\nbottoms even though movements to sandy bottoms were also observed. The exclusion \n\nof fishing nets in first 200m from the coastline in the partially protected areas confers \n\nadditional protection areas for white seabream given the narrow width of the rocky \n\nreefs. Consequently, the total amount of coastline where white seabream is protected \n\nfrom fishermen is around 20km which is 8.5 times the average maximum range length \n\nobserved for white seabream.  \n\nThe results of this study support the observations of Horta e Costa et al. (2013) which \n\nsuggest that white seabream might already be benefiting from the implementation of \n\nthe LSMP. \n\n \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAbecasis D, Bentes L, Coelho R, Correia C, Lino PG, Monteiro P, Goncalves JMS, Ribeiro \nJ, Erzini K (2008) Ageing seabreams: A comparative study between scales and otoliths. \nFish Res 89:37-48 \n\nAbecasis D, Bentes L, Erzini K (2009) Home range, residency and movements of \nDiplodus sargus and Diplodus vulgaris in a coastal lagoon: Connectivity between \nnursery and adult habitats.

Monitoring of MPAs is crucial to \n\nunderstand their effectiveness but also to their adaptive management. Experimental \n\nfishing surveys were carried in order to test the effect of the implementation of the \n\nLuiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP) on the abundance and biomass of Senegalese sole \n\nand cuttlefish. A total of 106 fishing sets were carried between 2007 and 2011, using \n\n500 m of trammel nets. The results of the beyond BACI analysis failed to detect any \n\nsignificant difference in either abundance or biomass of both species, between \n\nprotected and unprotected areas before and after the implementation of LSMP. The \n\npossible causes for the lack of a significant effect are discussed. \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) have been widely implemented as a tool to protect \n\nbiodiversity and/or manage fisheries (Roberts et al. 2005, Botsford et al. 2009). In most \n\ncases, especially those concerning fisheries management, MPAs are still seen mostly as \n\na precautionary measure against local fishery collapse, since empirical evidence about \n\ntheir success is still scarce (Clark 1996, Botsford et al. 1997, Charton &amp; Ruzafa 1999, \n\nGo\u00f1i et al. 2010, Vandeperre et al. 2011).  \n\n\n\n105 \n \n\nMPAs are seen as a way of overcoming uncertainty in fisheries management based on \n\nconventional measures (e.g. effort control, size and gear restrictions). Yet, the design \n\nof MPAs itself has also rested upon substantial uncertainty, mainly because \n\ninformation on the species habitat use and connectivity of their (sub)populations is \n\ngenerally lacking. This knowledge is crucial to an appropriate MPA design if one is to \n\nmaximize the benefits inside and outside the protected areas (Gr\u00fcss et al. 2011). Areas \n\nwhere extractive human activities are reduced or banned can provide a refuge for \n\noverexploited populations. In the long term, they can also act as sources of emigrant \n\nlarvae or post-recruit spillover that will replenish adjacent (fished) areas (Russ 2002). \n\nBy continuously protecting individual fish within its boundaries, MPAs should hold \n\nlarger and older fish, which will reach higher reproductive potential and eventually \n\nproduce offspring with better survival rates than those from younger fish, thereby \n\nbenefiting local populations through enhanced recruitment (Birkeland &amp; Dayton 2005). \n\nSpillover can take place when the movements of individual fish across the boundaries \n\nof an MPA result in a net emigration of fish to the outside areas, eventually increasing \n\nfisheries yields. Because those MPAs will typically hold higher densities than \n\nneighbouring fished areas, density dependence should promote this net spillover. This \n\nwas recently demonstrated in several empirical studies (e.g. Go\u00f1i et al. 2008, La Mesa \n\net al. 2011, Russ &amp; Alcala 2011). \n\nThe Arr\u00e1bida coastal environment (Portugal) harbours over 1200 registered marine \n\nspecies and is considered a hotspot of marine biodiversity in the northeastern Atlantic \n\n(Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2003, Cunha et al. 2011). In 1998 an MPA - the Luiz Saldanha Marine \n\nPark (LSMP) - was designated to protect this biodiversity and also to promote the \n\nsustainability of local artisanal fisheries and fishers\u2019 livelihoods. \n\nThe cuttlefish, Sepia officinalis (Linnaeus, 1758), and the Senegalese sole, Solea \n\nsenegalensis Kaup 1858, are the main targets of the artisanal fisheries based off the \n\nports of Set\u00fabal and Sesimbra, located near the LSMP (Serrano 1992, Batista et al. \n\n2009). Despite the variability in catches observed along the year, with higher catches \n\nof cuttlefish and the lowest for Senegalese sole during the autumn and winter months, \n\nthese two species represent the highest revenues (Batista et al. 2009).  \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the LSMP on the abundance \n\nand biomass of the local populations of cuttlefish and Senegalese sole. \n\n \n\nMaterials and methods \n\n \n\nStudy area \n\nThe LSMP is located in the Set\u00fabal Peninsula (Portugal) covering an area of \n\napproximately 53 km2 and stretching over 38 km of coastline (Figure 5.1). It includes a \n\nnarrow rocky reef down to 15 m deep and wider soft substrates (sand and mud) down \n\nto 100 m. This MPA includes one no-take zone of 4.3 km2, four partial protection zones \n\n(only octopus traps and jigs allowed) totalling 21 km2 and three complementary \n\nprotection zones (traditional fishing gears allowed for vessels smaller than 7m) \n\ntotalling 28 km2. Although designated in 1998, the final planning design of this MPA \n\nwas achieved in 2005, with full implementation of the management measures only in \n\n2009. The use of fishing nets was banned from the no-take zone and the partial \n\nprotection areas in August 2007, with the implementation of the full no-take area only \n\ntaking place in 2009. In addition, all fishing vessels need a permit to operate inside the \n\nLSMP. Recreational angling is only permitted in complementary areas and spearfishing \n\nis prohibited in the entire LSMP. \n\nExperimental fishing  \n\nIn order to estimate the abundance and biomass of cuttlefish and Senegalese sole in \n\nthe LSMP, a total of 106 experimental trammel net fishing sets were carried out. The \n\nexperimental net was made of monofilament and consisted of an inner mesh panel of \n\n100mm stretched mesh and two outer panels of 600mm stretched mesh. The inner net \n\nmonofilament mesh is of 0.30mm in diameter while that of the outer net is 0.50mm. \n\nThe net was constructed to have 50 inner and 3 outer meshes in height, with a total \n\nheight of 1.60m. Each net had a total of 50m in length and each set consisted of 10 \n\nnets. \n\n \n\n\n\n107 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1. Map of the study area. The black dots indicate the location of the \nexperimental fishing sets. The red area corresponds to the no-take area, the \norange areas represent the partially protected areas and the green areas stand \nfor complementary protection areas. \n\n \n\nThese fishing experiments took place in all protection levels: no-take area, partial \n\nprotection and the complementary protection. Sampling took place three times during \n\nthe first year after the ban of fishing nets in the no-take and partial protection areas \n\n(December 2007, May 2008 and October of 2008) and three times three years after \n\nthe ban (November 2010, May 2011 and October of 2011). Fishing trials took place in \n\ntwo bottom types, sandy bottoms (12-20 m) and muddy bottoms (35-45 m) using \n\n500m nets per set. Nets were set after sunrise and hauled 20 to 24 h later. The catch \n\nwas sorted onboard to the species level and fish were measured to the nearest \n\nmillimetre. Specimens were released alive whenever possible. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n108 \n \n\nData analysis \n\nCatches of trammel net sets were standardized as catch per unit effort (CPUE) in \n\nnumber (n) and weight (kg) per 1000 m of net and per 24 h. Cuttlefish weight was \n\nobtained by using the weight/length relationship W = 0.325xML2.64, where W is the \n\nweight in g and ML the mantle length in cm (Serrano 1992). Individual Senegalese sole \n\nweight was obtained by the weight/length relationship W = 5.29E-06xTL3.104, where W \n\nis the weight in g and TL the total length in mm (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 1997). Abundance and \n\nbiomass were log (x+1) transformed after tested for homogeneity of variance (Levene's \n\ntest). \n\nIn order to determine the effects of protection on the local population of Senegalese \n\nsole and cuttlefish, differences between the areas where each species was protected \n\nfrom fisheries, hereafter designated as \u2018impact\u2019 and areas where species were \n\naccessible to fisheries designated as \u2018control\u2019, were examined using ANOVA following a \n\nbeyond BACI experimental design (Underwood 1992, 1994). A three-way model was \n\nused to examine patterns on the abundance and biomass. The \u2018location\u2019 factor, which \n\nincludes the \u2018impact\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 areas, was set as a random factor. The factor \n\n\u2018before/after\u2019 was set as a fixed factor with two levels. The 2007 and 2008 \n\nexperimental fishing campaigns were regarded as \u2018before\u2019 the ban of fishing nets since \n\nthey occurred during the first year of ban. In fact, for cuttlefish this period was before \n\nthe onset of protection, since fishing gears such as jigs were still allowed in all areas. \n\nThe factor \u2018time of sampling\u2019 was set as a random factor nested in the \u2018before/after\u2019 \n\nfactor. Three replicates for each time x location were used. This design allowed us to \n\ntest whether there was an interaction between locations through time (Underwood \n\n1992, 1994). \n\nSince Senegalese sole is captured using fishing nets, the areas were these were banned \n\n(no-take and partially protected areas) were regarded as the putative \u2018impact\u2019 zone \n\nwhile the complementary protection zone was used as \u2018control\u2019. For cuttlefish the no-\n\ntake area corresponded to the \u2018impact\u2019 while the partial and complementary \n\nprotection zones correspond to \u2018control\u2019 because fishing gears that target cuttlefish \n\nsuch as jigs are still allowed in the partially protected areas. \n\n\n\n109 \n \n\nResults  \n\n \n\nLarge variations were observed in the CPUE of cuttlefish, both in abundance and \n\nbiomass (Figure 5.2 and Figure 5.3). However, the beyond BACI analysis showed that \n\nneither the number of individuals nor the biomass of cuttlefish differed between the \n\nno-take area and the controls (Table 5.1). There was also no difference in the temporal \n\npattern from one control location to other. More importantly, there was no significant \n\ndifference between before and after the implementation of the reserve in either the \n\nno-take or the control areas (Table 5.1).  \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2.

A decline both in abundance and biomass was \n\nobserved for Senegalese between the two sampling periods (Figure 5.4 and Figure 5.5). \n\nThe results of the beyond BACI analysis show that temporal trends in mean abundance \n\nand biomass of Senegalese sole were similar among the three locations \u2018before\u2019 the \n\nfishing net ban in the no-take and partial protection areas (Table 5.2: T(Bef)xC and \n\nT(Bef)xI were non-significant). Additionally, temporal trends in mean abundance and \n\nbiomass of Senegalese sole did not differ significantly between the two putatively \n\nimpacted zones (no-take and partial protection), as well as between these and that of \n\nthe control area from before to after the ban (Table 5.2: BxC and BxI were non-\n\nsignificant). Therefore, no significant change was detected in mean abundance or \n\nbiomass of Senegalese sole attributable to the ban of fishing nets. \n\n \n\n0 \n\n1 \n\n2 \n\n3 \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\nDec 2007 May 2008 Oct 2008  Nov 2010 May 2011 Oct 2011 \n\nCP\nU\n\nE \n(k\n\ng*\n10\n\n00\nm\n\n-1\n*2\n\n4h\n-1\n\n) \n \n\nSampling season \n\n\n\n111 \n \n\nTable 5.1.

Large interannual variation in cuttlefish recruitment has been observed in \n\nthe English Channel (Royer et al. 2006) and is described for several cephalopod stocks \n\n(Royer et al. 2002, Young et al. 2004). In fact, large fluctuations in recruitment success \n\nare to be expected in semelparous species, such as the cuttlefish, since the success of \n\ntheir reproduction is highly dependent on favorable environmental conditions at the \n\ntime of their reproduction (Pierce et al. 2008). Sea temperature and currents are two \n\nof the variables that are known to affect cuttlefish recruitment and abundance (Wang \n\net al. 2003). Henriques et al. (2007) have shown that SST and other factors such as \n\nwind and current patterns, which are greatly influenced by the North Atlantic \n\nOscillation (NAO), strongly influence the fish assemblages of the LSMP. \n\nNo evidence of an effect on Senegalese sole or cuttlefish abundance or biomass due to \n\nprotection status of the LSMP was found. Although it is possible that our sampling \n\ndesign failed to show putative effects, such designs are considered robust enough and \n\ntherefore we are confident with regard to the no-effect conclusion. In fact, the use of a \n\nbeyond-BACI approach is considered one of the most robust and valuable methods to \n\nexamine the potential effects of MPAs and has been advocated by several authors in \n\norder to provide unequivocal empirical evidences of such effects (e.g. Fraschetti et al. \n\n2002, Guidetti 2002, Russ 2002). According to Underwood (1992), with the use of this \n\nprocedure the effect of protection can be identified and distinguished from the \n\nstochastic variability of natural populations. Therefore, the fact that no significant \n\ninteractions were found between the periods \u2018before\u2019 and \u2018after\u2019 the implementation \n\nof the LSMP regulations indicate that, if there was indeed an effect of its \n\nimplementation on the abundance or biomass of the local populations of cuttlefish \n\nand Senegalese sole, then this effect was too small to be detected.  \n\nDespite the similar results for both species the reasons for the apparent lack of effect \n\nof the LSMP on the abundance and biomass are most probably different. In the case of \n\n\n\n115 \n \n\ncuttlefish, the results of a previous acoustic telemetry study appear to provide good \n\nevidence to explain the lack of reserve effect (Abecasis et al. 2013). The study showed \n\na lack of site fidelity and the existence of large movements which preclude the reserve \n\neffect of the LSMP since it cannot offer long term protection (Abecasis et al. 2013). On \n\nthe other hand, the results of the acoustic telemetry study of Senegalese sole suggest \n\nthat the LSMP could be providing enough protection to this species given the high site \n\nfidelity and the size of the home range (Chapter 3). Yet, the results of the beyond BACI \n\nanalysis failed to detect any significant interaction between the impact/control areas \n\nand the period before/after the ban of fishing nets in the abundance and biomass of \n\nSenegalese sole. A very parsimonious explanation for this lack of effect is the relatively \n\nyoung age of the LSMP. The use of fishing nets in the no-take and partially protected \n\nareas was only banned in 2007. It has been proven that the age of marine reserves has \n\na positive impact on commercial fish species abundance and biomass (Roberts et al. \n\n2001, Alcala et al. 2005). Another possibility is that the small size of the reserve \n\nprecludes such an effect if the establishment of new individuals inside the reserve is \n\nlimited by an already saturated habitat, especially if adult habitat use is mediated by a \n\nterritorial system and if juveniles face high competition for access to high quality \n\nhabitat, thus promoting density-dependent emigration. Such a pattern would, \n\nhowever, promote spillover but not the build up of biomass and, consequently, of \n\nincreased reproductive output and larval supply from the MPA. \n\nClearly, a conclusive evaluation will require continued monitoring for a period of years \n\nconcomitant with that necessary for benefits to be seen for most species elsewhere. \n\nFuture studies should also be carried in the areas adjacent to the LSMP in order to test \n\nthe effects of the implementation of the LSMP in these areas where Senegalese sole \n\nand cuttlefish are two of the most important fish resources. Additionally, the analysis \n\nof the landing records of the nearby fishing ports of Sesimbra and Set\u00fabal could be \n\ninteresting. However, it must be taken into account not only that this data is mostly \n\nincomplete due to illegal and unreported catches but also that there is no \n\ndifferentiation of sole species in the official landings statistics (Batista et al. 2009, \n\nTeixeira &amp; Cabral 2009).  \n\n\n\n116 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAbecasis D, Afonso P, O\u2019Dor RK, Erzini K (2013) Small MPAs do not protect cuttlefish \n(Sepia officinalis).

Yet, the true protection that they \n\nprovide to individual fish is unknown, leading to some of the uncertainty associated \n\nwith MPA effectiveness. Importantly, there has been very little progress on how to \n\ntranslate the individual scale of movement and home range data to the more relevant \n\npopulation scale when evaluating the effectiveness of protection from MPAs or \n\nforecasting their optimal designs. In this study, conducted in a small and recently \n\nestablished MPA (Luiz Saldanha Marine Park, Portugal), we combined the results of \n\nindividual home range estimation and population distribution models for three species \n\nof commercial importance and contrasting life histories to infer 1) the size of suitable \n\nareas where they would be fully protected, and 2) the vulnerability to fishing mortality \n\nof each species throughout the MPA. The results demonstrate that the protection \n\noffered by MPAs varies substantially, depending on the species home range and on the \n\nextent of the suitable protected area. This study highlights the need to consider a \n\nmulti-species approach and provides an explicit framework to upscale from individual \n\ntelemetry data to the needed population scale that can be of wide applicability for \n\nstudies evaluating the optimal design of MPAs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n121 \n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nMarine protected areas (MPAs) have become a key spatial management and \n\nconservation tool for coastal nations worldwide but their effectiveness is largely \n\nuncertain in most cases, if not all (Kaiser 2011). In fact, the size of the areas where the \n\ndifferent species are effectively protected and the amount of time they are available to \n\nthe fishery is typically unknown.  \n\nThe adequate design and management of MPAs is highly dependent on the quality of \n\nthe baseline ecological information. Of particular relevance is the knowledge of the \n\nspecies\u2019 site fidelity, distribution and habitat use (Glazer and Delgado 2006; Gr\u00fcss et al. \n\n2011; Le Quesne and Codling 2009; Schmiing et al. 2013). This data can not only help \n\ndetermine the initial location and correct size of MPAs based on the species habitat \n\nrequirements, but also provide relevant information for the adaptive management of \n\nalready implemented MPAs.  \n\nRecent studies have presented quantitative models to assess the efficiency of MPAs \n\n(Le Quesne and Codling 2009; Moffitt et al. 2009; Walters et al. 2007). However, these \n\nmodels do not take in consideration that no-take areas do not, in most cases, consist \n\nof 100% of suitable habitats. It is therefore possible that a no-take area, several times \n\nlarger than the species home range does not offer adequate protection. \n\nAcoustic telemetry is one of the most widely used methods to track marine species, as \n\nit provides long-term, fine scale spatio-temporal data on individual movement and \n\nhome range (e.g. Abecasis et al. 2012; Abecasis et al. 2013b). However, very little has \n\nbeen done and there is no consensus on how to translate such individual data - the \n\ntypical output of telemetry studies - into the more relevant population scale projection \n\nwhen evaluating the effectiveness of protection provided from existing MPAs or \n\nforecasting their optimal designs. \n\nThis study provides a framework to upscale the telemetry data from the individual to \n\nthe population level. This was achieved by combining information of species home \n\nrange areas with species distribution models so as to calculate the effective protection \n\n\n\n122 \n \n\nprovided to three species with contrasting life histories by a small coastal MPA, the \n\nLuiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP, Portugal). In particular, this study focused on \n\nanalysing the vulnerability to fishing of the three species \u2013 cuttlefish (Sepia officinallis), \n\nSenegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) and white seabream (Diplodus sargus) - and on \n\nestimating the size of suitable areas where these species are in fact protected from \n\nlocal fisheries. Arguably, an MPA design based on the requirements of only three \n\nspecies is unlikely to ensure the full protection of all local marine species. \n\nNevertheless, the contrasting life histories of these three species, all of which are also \n\nof key commercial importance for the region, ensure the wide spectra needed to \n\ndemonstrate the wider applicability of this framework towards this MPA and \n\nelsewhere. This study is also innovative in combining typical finfish with cephalopods \n\nand flatfishes, seldom used in MPA studies (Horta e Costa et al. 2013; Lester et al. \n\n2009) \n\nSpecies distribution models (SDMs) have become an important tool for studies in \n\nbiogeography, ecology, species management, conservation biology and climate change \n\n(Bean et al. 2012; Elith and Leathwick 2009b; Guisan and Thuiller 2005; Guisan and \n\nZimmermann 2000). These statistical methods associate species data (presence, \n\npresence/absence or abundance) with mapped environmental predictor variables \n\nand/or geographical information so as to provide information on the presence of \n\nspecies across the entire area of interest (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000).  \n\nRecent developments in the field of SDMs have produced multiple methods (Elith and \n\nGraham 2009; Elith et al. 2006) which are now commonly used to predict species \n\ndistribution, including generalized linear or additive models (GLMs or GAMs), \n\nmultivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), boosted regression trees (BRT) and \n\nmaximum entropy modeling (Maxent) (Elith and Leathwick 2009a; Newbold 2009). The \n\nlow data requirements and the ease of integration with GIS analysis have made \n\nMaxent one of the most widely used software for SDM (Elith et al. 2006, Elith &amp; \n\nLeathwick 2009). Different comparative studies using a wide range of data \n\ndemonstrated that Maxent is consistently among the best performing methods (Elith \n\net al. 2006; Hernandez et al. 2006; Navarro-Cerrillo et al. 2011). Maxent is a machine \n\nlearning method that predicts potentially suitable environmental conditions for the \n\n\n\n123 \n \n\nspecies through the use of presence records and a set of environmental variables, \n\ncontinuous and/or categorical, that are likely to influence the species fitness and long-\n\nterm persistence (Phillips et al. 2006; Phillips and Dud\u00edk 2008).  \n\nThe main objectives of this study were 1) to determine the amount of suitable habitats \n\nwhere three of the most commercially important fish species are effectively protected \n\n2) to determine the vulnerability of these species to fishing throughout the LSMP. \n\n \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\n \n\nStudy area  \n\nThis study took place in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), which was established \n\nin 1998 yet only fully implemented in 2009. Located on the Portuguese western coast, \n\nthis MPA covers an area of approximately 53 km2 stretching over 38 km of coastline. It \n\nincludes a narrow stretch of rocky reef habitats down to a depth of 15 m and a wider \n\nstretch of soft substrates (sand and mud) down to 100 m. The LSMP regulations specify \n\ndifferent zones and limitations to extractive activities. Commercial fisheries have \n\ndifferent limitations within the different zones: all fisheries are excluded from a no-\n\ntake zone of about 4.3 km2; octopus traps and jigs are allowed within the four partial \n\nprotection zones totalling 21 km2; and commercial fishing boats less than 7m long are \n\nallowed to operate using traditional fishing gear within the three complementary \n\nprotection zones totalling 28 km2. Spearfishing is prohibited within the entire area of \n\nthe LSMP, whereas recreational angling is only allowed within the three \n\ncomplementary protection zones. With these regulations, the cuttlefish is only fully \n\nprotected from its targeted fishery (trammel nets and jigs) within the no-take zone, \n\nwhereas the white seabream and the Senegalese sole are fully protected from their \n\ntargeted fisheries (longlines and nets, respectively) within both the no-take zone and \n\npartial protection zone. \n\n \n\n\n\n124 \n \n\nStudy species \n\nThis study focused on three species: the sparid Diplodus sargus (white seabream), the \n\nflatfish Solea senegalensis (Senegalese sole) and the cephalopod Sepia officinalis \n\n(cuttlefish). The three species are very distinctive from each other as they present \n\ncontrasting ecological traits and life-histories, but share high economical value across \n\nsouthern Europe. In the LSMP area, both the cuttlefish and the Senegalese sole are \n\ntargeted by the local small-scale commercial vessels that operate with trammel nets \n\nand gillnets (Batista et al. 2009), whereas the white seabream is mainly captured by \n\nartisanal longlines and recreational fishing (Veiga et al. 2010). Their habitat \n\npreferences are also very distinct: the Senegalese sole is a benthonic species that \n\noccupies soft substrates, the white seabream is a demersal species that prefers hard \n\nsubstrates such as rocky reefs, but also forages on soft substrates and the cuttlefish is \n\na nekton-benthonic species that makes use of both types of substrates. All three \n\nspecies have very different life-histories, even though they all use estuaries as nursery \n\nareas. Cuttlefish are semelparous species with a maximum life time of about two years \n\n(Le Goff and Daguzan 1991), whereas the Senegalese sole and the white seabream are \n\niteroparous species that can reach 8 and 18 years old respectively (Abecasis et al. \n\n2008, Teixeira and Cabral 2010). By focusing on species that present such different \n\nbiological, ecological and economic characteristics, this study should allow us to shed \n\nlight on the benefits and performance of this MPA for a wider range of species.  \n\nSpecies distribution modelling  \n\nTo model species distribution, we used the Maxent software version 3.3.3k (available \n\nfrom http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~schapire/maxent/) with the maximum number of \n\niterations set to 5000. Based on the ecological knowledge of the three species and the \n\navailability of environmental data for the area, we selected the following variables as \n\nexplanatory variables in the model: \u2018habitat\u2019, \u2018bathymetry\u2019, \u2018curvature\u2019, \u2018slope\u2019, \u2018aspect\u2019 \n\nand \u2018distance to rocky bottom\u2019. The variables \u2018curvature\u2019, \u2018slope\u2019 and \u2018aspect\u2019 represent \n\nthe surface curvature, the rate of maximum change in depth from each cell and the \n\ndirection that the slope is facing (North, South, East, West), respectively. The variables \n\n\u2018habitat\u2019 and \u2018aspect\u2019 were set as categorical variables, whereas the remaining \n\nvariables were set as continuous. Information on \u2018habitat\u2019 was collected by the \n\n\n\n125 \n \n\nPortuguese Sea and Atmosphere Institute (IPMA), using acoustic and video surveys, \n\nduring the BIOMARES project (Cunha et al. 2011). This data was presented in raster \n\nformat with a cell size of approximately 40m x 40m. The variable \u2018bathymetry\u2019 was \n\nestimated by combining data from a recent bathymetric survey carried out by IPMA \n\nwith information collected by the project BIOMARES. All the data used to estimate \n\n\u2018bathymetry\u2019 were included in the development of a raster file using the \u2018inverse \n\ndistance weighting\u2019 (IDW) raster interpolation tool available in the 3D Analyst Tools \n\npackage for ArcGIS 9.3. This final raster had a cell size of approximately 39m x 39m and \n\nwas the basis for estimating the variables \u2018slope\u2019, \u2018aspect\u2019 (slope direction) and \n\n\u2018curvature\u2019 using the Raster Surface tools in the 3D Analyst Tools package for ArcGIS \n\n9.3. In addition, we estimated the variable \u2018distance to rocky bottom\u2019 by extracting the \n\nareas containing rocky substrate using the \u2018extract by attributes\u2019 tool and then creating \n\na new raster file with the Euclidean distance to the nearest rocky bottom. All the raster \n\nfiles produced for the different variables were converted to the same projection, cell \n\nsize and geographic limits. We used the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) to test for \n\ncorrelations between variables, given that high correlations between variables should \n\nbe avoided in SDM as they could lead to over fitting of the model.  \n\nWe used presence data from previous acoustic telemetry studies on these three \n\nspecies (Abecasis et al. 2013a; unpublished data) as training data for the SDMs. A \n\nsampling bias file with the extension of the acoustically monitored area was used to \n\nremove the sampling distribution bias (Phillips et al. 2009). Data from experimental \n\ntrammel net monitoring surveys was used as independent test data for cuttlefish and \n\nSenegalese sole (Abecasis et al. 2013a; unpublished data). For the cuttlefish, however, \n\ngiven that its acoustic telemetry data presented a short temporal extent (November to \n\nDecember), we only considered the trammel net surveys carried out during autumn, \n\nwhich correspond to approximately the same time frame. As for the white seabream \n\nwe obtained test data from underwater visual observations given that this species is \n\nrarely caught by the trammel nets (for more details see Horta e Costa et al. 2013). We \n\nran models with regularization multipliers of 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5 and 3, and compared them \n\nusing the small sample size corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), estimated \n\nusing ENMTools (Warren and Seifert 2011), as recommended by Rodda et al. (2011). \n\n\n\n126 \n \n\nThe regularization multiplier parameter affects how closely fitted the output \n\ndistribution is \u2013 a value smaller than the default of 1.0 will result in a closer fit to the \n\ngiven presence records, while a larger regularization multiplier will give a more spread \n\nout, less localized prediction. The AICc approach weights model fit with the number of \n\nincluded variables to provide a relative score for each model. This score was then used \n\nto rank the models so as to determine the best resembling model based upon a \n\ncombination of explanatory power and parsimony criteria (Burnham et al. 2011).  \n\nAfter selecting the most adequate regularization multiplier we tried different feature \n\napproaches by running models using hinge only, linear plus quadratic and auto \n\nfeatures. Following the comparison of the different models with the AICc approach, we \n\nproceeded with the jackknife test of variable importance to see if any of the variables \n\ncould be removed without sacrificing the model performance. The jackknife test \n\ncalculates the drop in performance as each variable is removed from the fully specified \n\nmodel. We started with all variables and then proceeded by removing each variable \n\none by one based on the drop of the regularized training gain.  \n\nThe area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for model \n\nevaluation (Elith 2002). Although Lobo et al. (2008) considered that AUC was not \n\nappropriate for model comparison, Elith et al. (2011) have found it suitable to test for \n\nthe model's predictive performance. The AUC statistic ranges between 0 and 1, with 1 \n\nrepresenting a perfect model and 0.5 a model no different from random. To test the \n\nsignificance of the SDMs, we tested the AUC value against a null distribution of \n\nexpected AUC values based on random sampling (Raes and ter Steege 2007). For each \n\nspecies, 99 random null models were created and the 95 % confidence interval was \n\ncalculated. Since the presence locations were biased, the randomly drawn points were \n\nselected from the acoustically monitored area to avoid higher chances of significantly \n\ndeviating from the null model.  \n\nBecause Maxent produces continuous models, thresholds were adopted to make a \n\ndistinction between suitable and unsuitable habitat areas. Two thresholds were \n\napplied, the lowest presence threshold (LPT) and the maximum sensitivity plus \n\nspecificity threshold (MSST). The LPT, also known as minimum training presence, is the \n\n\n\n127 \n \n\nlowest prediction value returned by Maxent for a location with observed presence of \n\nthe species and is one of the most commonly used thresholds (Bean et al. 2012; \n\nPearson et al. 2007; Thorn et al. 2009). The MSST is equivalent to finding a point in the \n\nreceiver operating characteristic curve whose tangent slope equals 1 (Cantor et al. \n\n1999). This threshold is one of the various sensitivity-specificity methods, comparable \n\nwith each other in performance, and has been shown to achieve better results than \n\nLPT (Bean et al. 2012; Hernandez et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2005). The performance of the \n\nbinary models was measured using the true skill statistic (TSS). The TSS is independent \n\nof prevalence and its results are highly correlated with the AUC statistic (Allouche et al. \n\n2006). TSS varies between -1 and 1, where values below 0 represent models that \n\nperform no better than random and values close to 1 represent perfect agreement. \n\nWe combined information provided by the SDMs with home range information so as \n\nto determine the effective protection provided by the LSMP to the three study species. \n\nThe minimum, average and maximum length of home range for each species was \n\nestimated from information collected by previous telemetry studies conducted in the \n\narea (Abecasis et al, 2013a; unpublished data). From the SDMs, we calculated the size \n\nof the suitable areas where species were fully protected (no-take zone for cuttlefish \n\nand no-take plus partial protection zones for Senegalese sole and white seabream). \n\nVulnerability to fishing (VX) was estimated for each discrete point along the coast of \n\nthe LSMP for an individual with its home range centered there (Moffitt et al. 2009), \n\n?? =\n1\n?\n\n ? ?? + ?\n\n?=+(?2)\n\n?=?(?2)\n\n \n\nwhere H is the home range length and c is the coastline defined as  \n\n?? ?  0     reserve        \n 1    non reserve\n\n? \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n128 \n \n\nResults \n\n \n\nSpecies distribution models \n\nThe Pearson correlation test did not reveal any strong significant correlation between \n\nthe continuous variables: \u2018slope\u2019, \u2018bathymetry\u2019, \u2018curvature\u2019 and \u2018distance to rock\u2019 (r2=0 \n\nto 0.07), with only a medium negative correlation between \u2018bathymetry\u2019 and \u2018distance \n\nto rock\u2019 (r2 = - 0.38). Therefore, all variables were initially included in the Maxent \n\nmodels.  \n\n \n\nCuttlefish  \n\nThe cuttlefish distribution model with the regularization parameter of 3 presented the \n\nhighest AUC value. Nevertheless, the AICc revealed that the model using the \n\nregularization parameter of 1 was the most adequate from a parsimonious perspective \n\n(Table 6.1). The cuttlefish distribution model using auto features performed better \n\nthan the models using only hinge features or linear plus quadratic features (Table 6.1). \n\nThe AUC value for the models with different predictor variables was higher for the \n\nmodel containing the variables \u2018bathymetry\u2019, \u2018distance to rock\u2019, \u2018aspect\u2019 and \u2018slope\u2019 \n\n(Table 6.1). However, the AICc analysis suggests that the best performance was \n\nachieved when using all variables except \u2018slope\u2019 (Table 6.1). \n\nThe jackknife test revealed that \u2018bathymetry\u2019 was the variable that contributed the \n\nmost to the model, given that removing this variable resulted in the largest reduction \n\nof the regularized training gain.

Although the model with hinge only \n\nfeatures achieved the best AUC the AICc revealed that the model using auto features \n\nwas the more adequate. According to the AICc the best model was achieved when \n\nconsidering the variables \u2018bathymetry\u2019, \u2018habitat\u2019, \u2018aspect\u2019, \u2018slope\u2019 and \u2018curvature\u2019. The \n\njackknife test revealed that \u2018bathymetry\u2019 was the variable that contributed the most to \n\nthe model. The removal of this variable resulted in the largest reduction of the \n\nregularized training gain, indicating that bathymetry is the variable with the most \n\nuseful information and also the one that appears to have the most information that is \n\nabsent in the other variables. The distribution of Senegalese sole is highly dependent \n\non habitat and depth, which account for more than 80% of the SDM (Table 6.2).  \n\nFigure 6.1 presents the probability of presence of Senegalese sole in the study area \n\naccording to the different variables. The highest probability of presence occurred \n\nbetween the bathymetries of 5 m and 25 m, sea bottoms facing East, South-East and \n\nSouth, fine sands and medium sands habitats, and flatter sea bottoms in general with \n\nslope angles between 0.3 and 5. \n\nThe map with the final model of the presence probability of Senegalese sole in the \n\nLSMP area (AUC=0.951; 95% C.I AUC of the biased corrected null model = 0.944) shows \n\nthat the highest presence probabilities were found within the no-take zone and \n\nadjacent partial protection zones (Figure 6.3).

When the \n\nfeatures used were changed, the best model, in terms of AICc was achieved when \n\nusing the auto features option (Table 6.4). According to the AICc results, the best \n\nmodel was achieved when only the variables \u2018bathymetry\u2019, \u2018distance to rock\u2019, \u2018aspect\u2019 \n\nand \u2018slope\u2019 were used (Table 6.4). \n\n As for the previous species, \u2018bathymetry\u2019 was the variable that contributed the most \n\nto the model, according to the jackknife analysis of variable importance. Besides \n\nproviding the most useful information, this variable seems to present information that \n\nis absent for other variables. Table 6.2 shows the contribution of each variable to the \n\nwhite seabream distribution model. \n\nAccording to the final distribution model obtained for white seabream the highest \n\nprobability of presence occurs between the depths of 5 and 10m and when the \n\ndistance to rocky bottoms is less than 120m (Figure 6.1). The map with the final model \n\nof the presence probability of white seabream in the LSMP area (AUC=0.981; 95% C.I \n\nAUC of the biased corrected null model = 0.959) demonstrates that the areas with \n\nhighest probabilities are located near rocky shore areas throughout the entire MPA \n\n(Figure 6.4).

Zone 5 is \nthe no-take area. \n\n\n\n141 \n \n\nVulnerability to fishing \n\nThe regulated zones where both the Senegalese sole and the white seabream are \n\nprotected from fishing are larger than 25 km2 in total (no-take plus partially protected \n\nareas). For cuttlefish, the area where it is fully protected from fisheries is the no-take \n\narea which corresponds to approximately 4.2 km2. Although cuttlefish are also \n\nprotected in the first 200m from the coastline in partially protected areas these areas \n\nwere not considered given their small size. However, only a small proportion of these \n\nprotected areas corresponds to suitable habitats for these species (Table 6.5). The \n\nvulnerability to fishing, considering an individual\u2019s home range centered in the middle \n\nof the no-take area, was 0.0 for every species and home range considered (Figure 6.5). \n\nRegarding the western partial protection area the vulnerability to fishing was 0.0 for \n\nwhite seabream and Senegalese sole except when considering the maximum home \n\nrange for Senegalese sole where it reached a minimum of 0.05 (Figure 6.5).

It could be \n\nargued that other potentially relevant input variables (e.g. hydrodynamics and prey \n\ndistribution and abundance) could also prove useful to improve the predictive power \n\nof the spatial distribution models of these species. However, information on such \n\nvariables was either absent or unavailable at adequate spatial scales for this area. Also, \n\ngiven the number of individual geographical positions obtained from the acoustic \n\ntelemetry studies, only a small number of variables could be used to develop models \n\nthat would be parsimonious and yet biologically relevant (Elith and Leathwick 2009a). \n\nA model using static environmental variables is more parsimonious because it only \n\nrequires that the distribution of animals is the result of time independent \n\nenvironmental cues (Aarts et al. 2008).  \n\nImportantly, the six variables that were selected to run the SDMs reflect various \n\nenvironmental factors known to influence marine species distributions. The variable \n\n\u2018habitat\u2019 is widely used because marine species are known to prefer specific and \n\nsometimes distinct habitats throughout their life cycle. The variable \u2018bathymetry\u2019 is \n\nwidely used as an indirect proxy for several proximal factors such as temperature, \n\nsalinity, light and pressure (Elith and Leathwick 2009b). The variable \u2018aspect\u2019 was \n\nselected as a proxy for hydrodynamic variables since, in this specific case, bottoms \n\noriented to the S and W quadrants are more influenced by strong winds and high seas \n\n\n\n147 \n \n\nwhereas those facing N and E quadrants are more sheltered. The variables \u2018slope\u2019 and \n\n\u2018curvature\u2019 were also taken in consideration because these have been associated as \n\npredictor variables for several marine species (Leathwick et al. 2008; Owens et al. \n\n2012; Schmiing et al. 2013). The variable \u2018distance to rocky bottoms\u2019 could be \n\ninterpreted differently depending on the studied species. The white seabream, for \n\ninstance, is known to prefer rocky bottom habitats (Abecasis et al. 2013b) and \n\ntherefore \u2018distance to rocky bottoms\u2019 is likely to simply stand for distance to its \n\npreferred habitat. In the particular case of the cuttlefish, however, it can be \n\ninterpreted as distance to spawning grounds, given that this species prefers soft \n\nsubstrate but attaches its eggs to hard substrates like seaweeds, shells and debris, and \n\nsuch substrates are more frequently found on rocky bottoms. In fact, egg clutches \n\nwere frequently observed in the acoustic receivers\u2019 mooring structures, particularly in \n\nthose located in vast sandy areas furthest away from rocky bottoms (Abecasis et al. \n\n2013a), where other hard substrates are absent or rare. These observations support \n\nthe hypothesis that cuttlefish uses habitats closer to rocky bottoms during the \n\nspawning season because it is easier to find adequate substrates to attach their eggs. It \n\nalso explains why the variables \u2018distance to rocky bottom\u2019 and \u2018bathymetry\u2019 were the \n\nmost important ones for the final cuttlefish\u2019s SDM, especially taking in consideration \n\nthat data collection took place during the migration/spawning months of November \n\nand December.  \n\nThe observed Pearson correlation values were not sufficiently high to require the \n\nremoval of any predictor variable, a step that some authors recommend when high \n\ncorrelations are observed (Gregr 2011; Leathwick et al. 2005; Rodda et al. 2011), even \n\nthough Maxent is known to be more stable than other regression methods when using \n\ncorrelated variables (Elith et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2006). \n\nThe response curves obtained for the predictor variables were, in most cases, very \n\ncomplex and thus reduced the number of false negatives. This is especially relevant \n\nbecause a low number of false negatives is highly desirable in the particular case of \n\nconservation spatial planning because false negatives could lead potentially suitable \n\nareas to be left out of management plans (Ara\u00fajo and Guisan 2006). \n\n\n\n148 \n \n\nThe SDMs for Senegalese sole and white seabream were estimated with presence \n\nlocations obtained throughout almost the entire year. Therefore, it is likely that the \n\nsuitability and presence probability maps represent an accurate picture for habitat \n\nselection of adults of both species in the LSMP. However, this was not the case for \n\ncuttlefish, for which presence data was only obtained for a shorter period of time \n\n(Abecasis et al. 2013a). Considering that cuttlefish is a migratory species that inhabits a \n\nwide range of habitats, it is highly probable that the distribution model obtained \n\nunderestimates the true distribution for this species during its adult phase. Instead, \n\nthe information provided by the model should be interpreted as an SDM for the \n\ncuttlefish\u2019s spawning period because presence data were obtained from adults during \n\nthis period (Abecasis et al. 2013a).  \n\n \n\nHabitat suitability  \n\nThe suitability maps revealed that the LSMP area facing south contains the highest \n\namount of suitable habitats for all three species. The fact that this area is sheltered \n\nfrom the dominant North winds and ocean swell has been put forward as one of the \n\nreasons for its high biodiversity (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2003).  \n\nDespite the good TSS values associated with the obtained SDMs, the results for white \n\nseabream might be slightly biased given that the areas defined as suitable when using \n\nthe MSST expanded further away from rocky bottoms than anticipated, considering \n\nthe results of experimental fishing trials. Some bias related with less accurate positions \n\nused as training data may have occurred and, as a result, several sandy bottoms areas \n\nrelatively distant from rocky bottoms scored high probability of presence. Additionally, \n\nthe method used to obtain the fishes\u2019 fine scale positions has limited capability to \n\ndistinguish between a true position over rocky bottom from an assumed position over \n\nsandy bottoms. This limitation results from the fact that the acoustic receivers were \n\nlocated in line with each other, parallel to the coast, and on sandy bottoms. \n\nConsequently, nearly all locations were associated with sandy bottoms when, in fact, \n\nfish were likely roving over the nearby rocky bottoms within the detection range. This \n\npossibility is supported by the inclusion of \u2018distance to rocky bottoms\u2019 as the second \n\n\n\n149 \n \n\nmost important variable for the white seabream distribution model, confirming \n\nprevious studies that demonstrated this species\u2019 preference for rocky bottoms, even \n\nthough excursions to sandy bottoms may be frequent (Abecasis et al. 2013b). \n\nRegarding the Senegalese sole, the SDM model suggest that fine and medium sand are \n\nthe habitats with the highest probabilities of presence, which is consistent with the \n\nresults of habitat selection studies (unpublished data). \n\nDepth was the variable that most contributed to the distribution model of white \n\nseabream and Senegalese sole and the third most important for the cuttlefish model. \n\nAccording to our models, the depth interval in which the white seabream and the \n\nSenegalese sole were more common is consistent with the results obtained during the \n\nexperimental fishing (unpublished data). As for cuttlefish, the model suggested a \n\npresence probability limited to the interval between 0 and 40 meters deep. However, \n\nthis might not reflect the true bathymetric distribution of this species, which is known \n\nto occur at depths up to 200m (Guerra 2006), particularly because the area monitored \n\nduring the acoustic telemetry campaigns was confined to shallower habitats given the \n\nlimited number of receivers available. Moreover, the presence locations were \n\nobtained during a short period of time which overlapped the spawning season, during \n\nwhich cuttlefish has been reported to migrate into shallower waters (Ezzeddine-Najai \n\n1997; Gauvrit et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2003). \n\n \n\nProtection  \n\nOur results demonstrate that the LSMP offers different levels of protection, depending \n\non species. This is not only the result of the different regulations applied to each of the \n\nLSMP\u2019s zones (e.g. the fishery targeting cuttlefish is only forbidden within the no-take \n\nzone, whereas the fisheries targeting Senegalese sole and white seabream are \n\nforbidden in both the no-take and partially protected zones) but also a consequence of \n\nthe different movement patterns and home range areas required by each species. \n\nOverall, the LSMP appears to provide full protection from fisheries to resident \n\nindividuals of white seabream and Senegalese sole that have their home range \n\n\n\n150 \n \n\ncentered anywhere in the no-take area or in central areas of partial protection zones. \n\nIn fact, the results of a recent study suggest that white seabream may already be \n\nbenefiting from the implementation of the LSMP (Horta e Costa et al. 2013). As for the \n\nSenegalese sole, the LSMP seems to play an important role in the protection of local \n\nstocks, given the large size of suitable areas for this species located within areas where \n\nthe species is fully protected. However, the effects of protection to this species are yet \n\nto be detected (unpublished data).  \n\nCuttlefish, on the other hand, appears to benefit from less protection as our results \n\nindicate higher vulnerability to fishing throughout the LSMP. Previous studies suggest \n\nthat this species presents low site fidelity and undertakes large migrations (Abecasis et \n\nal. 2013a), which is consistent with the short periods of time in which tagged cuttlefish \n\nremained within the study area. Therefore, despite the protection provided by the no-\n\ntake area to cuttlefish, this result might be misleading since this species presents no \n\nsite fidelity. \n\nIt should be taken in consideration that this study focuses on adult individuals only. \n\nImportant factors such as larval dispersal and recruitment should be taken in \n\nconsideration when overall MPA efficiency is assessed. Nevertheless, this framework \n\nprovides important information regarding the protection of commercially important \n\nfish species.  \n\nConclusions \n\nThis study demonstrates that long-term passive acoustic telemetry data in conjunction \n\nwith fine scale environmental data and maximum entropy modeling techniques can \n\nprovide useful SDMs. The combined use of home range areas and SDMs provides a \n\nbetter insight into the true potential of MPAs in effectively protecting marine species, \n\nsince it can reveal the size of the areas where protection is most effective and a clear, \n\nquantitative estimation of the vulnerability to fishing throughout the entire MPA. It \n\ncan and should be used in identifying multispecies optimal MPA designs, whether this \n\nis done a priori or as part of an adaptive management strategy of MPAs. \n\n\n\n151 \n \n\nIn the particular case of the LSMP, the levels of protection suggest that this MPA may \n\nprovide adequate protection for Senegalese sole and white seabream if compliance is \n\nadequate, but this is not the case of cuttlefish, given this species\u2019 higher levels of \n\nexposure to fisheries and very low residency.  \n\n \n\n\n\n152 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAarts G, MacKenzie M, McConnell B, Fedak M, Matthiopoulos J (2008) Estimating \nspace-use and habitat preference from wildlife telemetry data.

These three factors were analyzed for a small \n\ncoastal MPA, the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), for which a very limited amount of \n\nlocal ecological information was available at the start of its implementation in 1998. \n\nMarxan was used to provide a number of near optimal solutions considering different \n\nlevels of protection for the various conservation features and different costs. These \n\nsolutions were compared with the existing no-take area of the LSMP. Conservation \n\nfeatures included eleven habitat types and distribution models for three of the most \n\nimportant species for the local artisanal fisheries. The human activities with highest \n\nimpact in the study area (commercial and recreational fishing and scuba diving) were \n\nused as costs. The results show that the existing no-take area is actually located in the \n\nbest area. However, the no-take area offers limited protection to vagile fish and covers \n\na very small proportion of some of the available habitats. An increase in the \n\nconservation targets led to an increase in the number of no-take areas. The best \n\nsolution, to target 15% of each conservation feature included three separate no-take \n\nareas totalling an area almost twice the size of the existing no-take. Yet, although \n\nproviding higher level of protection to most habitats individually, each no-take area \n\noffers less protection to the fish species. An increase in 30% resulted in four no-take \n\nareas but, in this case, the protection offered to the study species was higher given \n\ntheir larger size.   \n\n\n\n159 \n \n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\nThe design, size and location of marine protected areas (MPAs) continue to be widely \n\ndebated but no consensus has yet been found (Glazer and Delgado 2006, White et al. \n\n2009, Gaines et al. 2010). High-quality baseline information is essential not only to \n\ndetermine the design, size and location of MPAs but also to help during the adaptive \n\nmanagement process, given that many times such information is not available at the \n\ntime of MPA creation. Adaptive management is a formal process to improve \n\nmanagement practices by learning from the outcomes of operational and experimental \n\napproaches (Bunnel et al. 2009). This process should be both scientific and social, \n\nrequiring an open management where all stakeholders are included. The effectiveness \n\nof this approach is based on four key elements (Agardy et al. 2003, Grafton &amp; Kompas \n\n2005). First, it is adaptive, and intended to be self-improving. Second, it is a formal \n\napproach that combines the power of science with the practicality of management. \n\nThird, it is an on-going process for continually improving management, so the design \n\nmust connect directly to the actions it is intended to improve. Fourth, although \n\nexperimental approaches can be incorporated into adaptive management effectively, \n\noperational approaches and temporal and spatial scales are emphasized to allow direct \n\nconnection to the efforts of managers.  \n\nData on habitat type is considered to be the core baseline information since it can \n\noften be mapped relatively easily and because it can serve as a proxy for benthic \n\nbiodiversity (Smith et al. 2006). Most authors agree that this baseline information \n\nshould also include information on the movements, patterns of habitat use, home \n\nrange areas and site fidelity of target species to protect (Babcock et al. 2012, Glazer \n\nand Delgado 2006). In addition, the need to include socioeconomic data is also \n\nbecoming evident (Ban et al. 2009). Despite all these considerations most MPAs are \n\ndesigned and implemented with little baseline information and the process rarely \n\ntakes into consideration all the stakeholders. This was the case of the Luiz Saldanha \n\nMarine Park (Portugal), a small coastal MPA implemented starting in 1998. \n\n\n\n160 \n \n\nGeographic information systems (GIS) are one of the best tools to visualize the \n\ndistribution of different habitats, the location of essential fish habitats and other \n\ninformation relevant to the design and management of MPAs. However, GIS alone \n\ndoes not provide stakeholders with design options, including where best to locate \n\nMPAs. The optimization of an MPA design is a problem where the goal is to find the \n\nbest possible solution given a set of targets and constraints. The recent development \n\nof systematic conservation planning software has provided stakeholders with tools \n\nthat present different MPA design solutions. Of the several available software options, \n\nMarxan is the most widely used given its ability to include different types of data and \n\nthe easy connection with GIS (Ball et al. 2009). It has been used in studies throughout \n\nthe world including the design of several MPAs such as the Channel Islands and \n\nMadagascar (Airame et al. 2003, Allnutt et al. 2012). Marxan tries to find a near \n\noptimal solution that reaches the pre-determined conservation targets while \n\nmaintaining the cost of including planning units as low as possible. The costs \n\nassociated with each planning unit can represent acquisition costs, management costs \n\nor opportunity costs. In marine environments opportunity costs related with \n\ncommercial and/or recreational fisheries catch or effort are commonly used. \n\nSince Marxan provides several near optimal solutions, it allows dialogue between the \n\ndifferent stakeholder groups in order to achieve the best compromise for all user \n\ngroups involved, in a transparent manner.  \n\nIn this study we compared the location and design of an already implemented coastal \n\nno-take area included in the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (Portugal) with different near \n\noptimal solutions provided by Marxan. The influence of different target levels and \n\ncosts on the optimal design and location of the no-take area was tested. Besides \n\nproviding a comparative framework that can be applied elsewhere this information is \n\nespecially relevant to local stakeholders and managers in order to proceed with \n\nadaptive management. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n161 \n \n\nMaterials and Methods  \n\n \n\nThis study focused on the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park (LSMP), a marine reserve located \n\nin the Set\u00fabal Peninsula (Portugal). The LSMP was established in 1998 but \n\nmanagement regulations were only fully implemented in 2009. Although covering an \n\narea of approximately 53 km2, only 4.2 km2 are included in one no-take zone where all \n\nhuman activities, apart from those related with scientific research and enforcement, \n\nare prohibited. The remaining area includes 21 km2 of partially protected areas, where \n\nonly octopus traps and jigs are allowed at more than 200m from the shoreline, and 28 \n\nkm2 of complementary areas where traditional fishing gears are allowed for vessels \n\nsmaller than 7m and recreational angling is permitted (Figure 7.1). \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1.  Map of the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park including the different \nprotection level areas. \n\n \n\nEleven different habitat types were identified in the LSMP by the Portuguese Sea and \n\nAtmosphere Institute (IPMA) during acoustic and video surveys carried during the \n\nBIOMARES project (Cunha et al. 2011). \n\n\n\n162 \n \n\nIn addition to the information on different habitats, the habitat suitability for three key \n\nspecies (cuttlefish, white seabream and Senegalese sole) was also used. These species \n\npresent very different life-history, ecological traits and economic values (see Chapter \n\n6). This information comprised three different levels for each species. The first level \n\ncorresponds to unsuitable areas for the species, the second to areas where the \n\nprobability of presence was up to 80%, and the final level where the presence \n\nprobability was over 80%. \n\nThe study area was divided in planning units consisting of regular hexagons with an \n\narea of 1600 m2 (each side with 24.816 m). The total amount of each feature was \n\nquantified for the entire LSMP and for the no-take area only. This allowed us to know \n\nthe total area of each conservation feature available in the LSMP and also the amount \n\nof protection offered by the already implemented no-take area to each of the 20 \n\nconservation features (the 11 different habitat types and the three suitability level \n\nareas for each species). \n\nSix different scenarios with different costs and targets were run in Marxan (Table 7.1). \n\nAlthough there are many human activities in the region, the one with the most \n\nsignificant and direct impact on marine resources in the LSMP area is commercial \n\nfishing, followed by recreational fishing and scuba diving (Gon\u00e7alves, 2005). Data on \n\nfishing effort (boat based commercial and recreational fishing) was based on the \n\nresults of Gon\u00e7alves (2005). The most important scuba diving locations were also taken \n\nin consideration. This data was obtained from Rodrigues (2008) and consists of a 100m \n\nbuffer around the 25 most dived locations based on the number of divers in each \n\nlocation for four diving tour operators. Two different cost layers were considered, 1) \n\ncommercial fishing only and 2) combined cost of commercial fishing, recreational \n\nfishing and scuba diving. Data on fishing effort and diving locations from a period \n\nbefore the implementation of the LSMP were used in order to compare with the \n\nsituation when the LSMP was implemented. \n\nThree different targets were chosen: 1) targets that were the same as the protection \n\noffered to each conservation feature by the implemented no-take area, 2) 15% of the \n\ntotal available area in the LSMP for each of the habitats and 5%, 15% and 30% of each \n\n\n\n163 \n \n\nspecies unsuitable, suitable and highly suitable areas for each species respectively and \n\n3) 30% of the total available area in the LSMP for each of the habitats and 10%, 30% \n\nand 50% of each species unsuitable, suitable and highly suitable areas respectively \n\n(Table 7.1). \n\n \n\nTable 7.1. Targeted protection and costs used for each scenario run in Marxan. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nScenario Cost Target protection \n\n1 Commercial fisheries Existing protection \n\n2 Commercial and recreational fisheries plus diving Existing protection \n\n3 \n\n \n\nCommercial fisheries \n\n \n\n15% habitats \n\nSpp 5%; 15%; 30% \n\n4 Commercial and recreational fisheries plus diving \n15% habitats \n\nSpp 5%; 15%; 30% \n\n5 Commercial fisheries \n30% habitats \n\nSpp 10%; 30%; 50% \n\n6 Commercial and recreational fisheries plus diving \n30% habitats \n\nSpp 10%; 30%; 50% \n\n\n\n164 \n \n\nFor each scenario, 100 Marxan models were run with 1x109 iterations using the Zonae \n\nCogito interface (Segan et al. 2011). The boundary length modifier (BLM) option was \n\nused to ensure the solutions comprised a compact set of no-take areas. Although a \n\ncompact network required protecting a greater total area to meet our targets, the \n\nresulting no-take areas are more likely to be successful than a highly fragmented and \n\ndispersed network. The BLM was fine tuned following the procedures described in \n\nGame and Grantham (2008). The number of times a planning unit was selected in a run \n\nwas estimated in order to identify the areas that were chosen more often, indicative of \n\nareas of higher importance. \n\n \n\nResults \n\n \n\nThe results for scenarios 1 and 2, where the targets for all conservation features are \n\nthe same as in the existing no-take area, show that the implemented no-take area is \n\nvery close to the near optimal solution estimated by Marxan considering the \n\nconservation features used in this study (Figure 7.2). This was true when considering \n\nthe combined costs of commercial and recreational fishing together with scuba diving \n\nbut also when considering the costs of commercial fishing alone. When observing the \n\nnumber of times each planning unit was selected there were two highly selected areas \n\nlocated at opposite ends of the no-take area. Nevertheless, the most chosen planning \n\nunits are inside the existing no-take area (Figure 7.3). For this reason, the amount of \n\nsuitable habitats is very close to the results obtained for the existing no-take area \n\n(Table 7.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n165 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.2.

Figure 7.3 shows the number of times each planning unit was selected in \n\nscenarios 3 and 4. There were no large differences in the amount of suitable habitat \n\nincluded in the no-take area between the existing no-take area and scenarios 3 and 4 \n\n(Table 7.2). However, in the latter, all habitats had at least 15% of their total area \n\nprotected, which clearly contrasts with the protection provided by the existing no-take \n\narea where some habitats have less than 5% of the total available area protected \n\nScenario 2 Scenario 1 \n\nScenario 6 Scenario 5 \n\nScenario 4 Scenario 3 \n\n\n\n166 \n \n\n(Table 7.2). Scenarios 3 and 4 present three no-take areas with a total area close to \n\ntwice the size of the implemented no-take area (Table 7.2).   \n\nFor scenarios 5 and 6 (30% of each habitat and 10%, 30% and 50% of each species \n\nunsuitable, suitable and highly suitable) the best solutions included four no-take areas \n\ntotalling an area almost 3.5 times larger than the existing no-take area (Figure 7.2). The \n\nsummed solutions of the 100 Marxan runs for scenarios 5 and 6 show four large, highly \n\nselected areas including the whole already implemented no-take area (Figure 7.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.3.

Given the limitations on data availability \n\nwe used information on 11 different habitats identified in the LSMP and habitat \n\nsuitability models for the three of the most important species as conservation \n\nfeatures. Smith et al. (2009) recommend the use of habitat type as conservation \n\nfeatures since it can act as a surrogate for benthic biodiversity. These authors also \n\nrecognize that species distributions models can be used as conservation features. \n\nRegarding the cost layers, and because the true cost of all human activities is still a \n\nlong way from being quantified, we opted to use the best available spatial data on the \n\nlocation and intensity of the major human activities taking place in the LSMP.  \n\nOur results demonstrate that, if the targets of the no-take area were to be the ones \n\nachieved by the already implemented no-take area, then its current location is the \n\nbest. This was true when considering the cost of commercial fishing alone but also \n\nwhen taking in consideration the combined costs of commercial and recreational \n\nfishing together with scuba diving. However, the protection achieved by the \n\nimplemented no-take area is not enough to effectively protect cuttlefish (Abecasis et \n\nal., 2013) and it also covers small amounts of largely available habitats such as rocky \n\noutcrops (<1%), coarse sand (<5%) or muddy fine sand (<3%). Although these habitats \n\nare not the most relevant for the three studied species, there are other commercial \n\nspecies for which such habitats are important (e.g. Solea solea, Microchirus azevia, \n\nChelidonichthys spp.).  \n\nIn contrast, the results for scenarios 3 and 4, with targets set to 15% of each habitat \n\nand 5%, 10% and 30% for species different suitability levels, show a total no-take area \n\nwith almost twice the size of the existing no-take area. Nevertheless, because the best \n\nsolution includes three separate no-take areas, their effectiveness might be limited \n\nsince their individual area is less than 3.4 km2 which provides little protection from \n\nfisheries (see Chapter 6). Yet, from a fisheries management perspective, these \n\nscenarios could provide a better solution since they should allow higher amounts of \n\n\n\n170 \n \n\nspillover while still offering some protection (Halpern &amp; Warner 2003, Gaines et al. \n\n2010, Fenberg et al. 2012). Additionally, in these solutions (scenarios 3 and 4) all \n\nidentified habitats have at least 15% of the area available in the LSMP set as no-take.  \n\nThe results obtained for scenario 5 and 6 (with targets set to 30% of each habitat and \n\n5%, 10% and 30% for species different suitability levels) also contemplate several no-\n\ntake areas, but because these areas are larger (two areas have more than 4.5km2) they \n\noffer higher protection to all studied species. In addition, all habitats have at least 30% \n\nof the total available area set aside as no-take, ensuring a high level of protection. In \n\nfact, the results of the previous chapter suggest that these scenarios would provide a \n\nmuch lower vulnerability to fishing for all three species throughout the LSMP. \n\nOur options for target levels were based on the literature review which suggests \n\ntargets between 15% and 30% (Allnutt et al. 2012, Fraschetti et al. 2009, Green et al. \n\n2009). However, some authors claim that, in the case of severely overfished or highly \n\nmobile species, no-take areas may not be effective as a primary management tool \n\nunless much more than 20% is closed (e.g. Murawski et al. 2000, Sale et al. 2005). \n\nNevertheless, we suggest that target values should be reviewed for each species based \n\non monitoring data for each particular MPA, particularly when they are the target of \n\nMPAs protection. As seen in the previous chapter, the amount of protection offered by \n\na no-take area can vary substantially between species. \n\nIn this study we used Marxan to obtain near optimal solutions regarding the design, \n\nsize and location of no-take areas for different scenarios considering different costs \n\nand conservation targets. The solutions presented in this study suggest that the \n\nperformance of the LSMP could be improved with some changes in its design.  These \n\ndifferent solutions are useful for the adaptive management of the LSMP, and to the \n\nwider significance in the context of the science of MPAs. Ecosystem based \n\nconservation management, especially when considering fisheries management, must \n\nfollow an adaptive management process where changes should be introduced based \n\non the evaluation and monitoring processes of the MPA (Grafton and Kompas 2005, \n\nHilborn et al. 2004).  \n\n\n\n171 \n \n\nThe conservation planning process should be an adaptive process where the location \n\nand size of protected areas change in accordance to new constraints and availability of \n\nbetter data (Smith et al. 2009). Therefore, the results provided by the different \n\nscenarios analyzed, even though based on limited data, provide stakeholders with \n\nseveral solutions. This will allow for different approaches regarding targets of \n\nconservation features and the different costs considered. Information on other \n\nconservation features such as other species suitable/unsuitable areas and additional \n\ncosts can be added to this framework in order to make the adaptive management an \n\nevolving and continuous process. \n\nEven though the actual LSMP design only contemplates one no-take area, the \n\nenforcement is very poor and transgressions are frequent. Therefore, a solution which \n\nincludes increasing the number of no-take areas would necessarily imply an increase in \n\nenforcement in order for these areas to function as true no-take areas. \n\nOne other issue would be the loss of fishing grounds for the local artisanal fisheries. \n\nFishermen would not only loose access to a larger area, especially when comparing \n\nscenarios 5 and 6 with the actual design, but there would also be an increasing \n\ncompetition for the best fishing grounds. This could eventually lead to a decrease in \n\nthe number of fishing boats as observed after the implementation of the LSMP (Horta \n\ne Costa et al. 2013). Yet, it is worth noting that when comparing the areas set as no-\n\ntake areas in this study with the fishing hotspots found by Horta e Costa et al. (2013) \n\nthere is only a small overlap with the areas presently used by fishermen. This was \n\npossible because the cost to fisheries was included in the models and therefore the \n\nmost used fishing grounds would still be available in most cases. \n\nBesides Marxan, other options can be used for systematic conservation planning, such \n\nas Marxan with zones or Zonation among others. We chose Marxan for its efficiency, \n\nflexibility and easy integration with GIS. However, it should be noted that Marxan does \n\nnot tell which conservation features are important and how much area should be \n\nprotected. In addition, Marxan only allows one single cost layer and its solutions do \n\nnot ensure the resilience of species. The use of Marxan is not straightforward, as the \n\n\n\n172 \n \n\nprocess of preparing input files and learning its proper use takes time. Therefore, other \n\napproaches should be investigated and compared in the future. \n\n \n\n\n\n173 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nAbecasis D, Afonso P, O\u2019Dor RK, Erzini K (2013) Small MPAs do not protect cuttlefish \n(Sepia officinalis).

Given that this study started five years after the time of the MPA \n\nimplementation, we also investigated whether any changes on species abundance or \n\nbiomass have occurred within the limits of this the MPA. \n\nThe specific questions we tried to answer were: \n\nWhat is the size of cuttlefish, Senegalese sole and white seabream home range \n\nareas? \n\nThe home range areas (95% KUD) varied between 0.43 and 1.56 km2 (average of 0.77 \n\nkm2) for the white seabream and between 0.54 and 2.22 km2 (average of 1.19 km2) for \n\nthe Senegalese sole. The results obtained for cuttlefish were not coherent given the \n\nlow site fidelity that this species presented. \n\n Do these species present site fidelity to the marine reserve? \n\nHigh site fidelity was observed for the white seabream, as most individuals tagged with \n\nV9 acoustic transmitters were detected over 50% of the time (average of 70%). Some \n\nSenegalese sole also presented high site fidelity, yet the majority of the tagged \n\nindividuals were more transient. The cuttlefish demonstrated no site fidelity to the \n\nstudy area, with only one individual spending a maximum of 39 days inside the \n\nmonitored area.   \n\n Do these species favour any particular habitats within the study area? \n\nThe white seabream demonstrated a clear preference for rocky bottoms habitats, \n\nwhile the Senegalese sole prefers sandy bottoms, especially medium coarse sand. A \n\n\n\n179 \n \n\ncombination of short monitoring periods and large movement patterns invalidated the \n\nanalysis of habitat preferences for the cuttlefish.      \n\nIs it possible to already detect the effects of the marine reserve \n\nimplementation on the abundance and/or biomass of Senegalese sole or \n\ncuttlefish? \n\nThe results of the experimental fishing trials revealed no significant differences in the \n\nabundance or biomass of Senegalese sole or cuttlefish between the periods before and \n\nafter the implementation of the LSMP. \n\nIs the actual design of the LSMP appropriate for the protection/management of \n\nthe three selected species? \n\nOur results suggest that the existing MPA may offer appropriate protection for the \n\nSenegalese sole and the white seabream. However, it does not provide adequate \n\nprotection for the cuttlefish, given this species\u2019 low site fidelity and large movements. \n\nWould changes in the size and location of no-take areas improve the efficiency \n\nof the LSMP? \n\nAccording to the results of the different scenarios obtained with Marxan, the LSMP \n\ndesign could be improved in order to offer more protection to habitats that are only \n\nmarginally protected with the current design and/or increase the amount of protection \n\noffered to the selected species.  \n\n \n\nImplications for the Luiz Saldanha Marine Park \n\n \n\nThe results of this study provide appropriate and useful information that can be used \n\ntowards the adaptive management of coastal MPAs and the LSMP in particular. As in \n\nnearly all MPAs, the need for a multispecies based management is stressed given the \n\nmultispecific nature of the artisanal fisheries operating within the LSMP and its \n\nadjacent waters. Furthermore, this is an improvement to implement the ecosystem \n\n\n\n180 \n \n\napproach to fisheries management because it adds to the effects of MPAs, which are \n\nalready multispecific and species dependent (Claudet et al. 2010), an explicit \n\nmultispecific consideration into its design.  \n\nWhile one should recognise that an MPA based on three species is unlikely to meet the \n\nrequirements of all species occurring in the region, we also emphasize that the three \n\nspecies were selected for their contrasting characteristics (life history, economic value, \n\netc) in order to capture as much ecological variability (hence variability effects) as \n\npossible. In addition, these species are economically important throughout the \n\nMediterranean and ecologically similar to target species of other commercial fisheries \n\nin temperate coastal areas elsewhere. Furthermore, the results obtained in this study \n\nare representative of a wide variety of species that are important to sustain the local \n\nartisanal fisheries and fishers\u2019 livelihoods, which is one of this MPA\u2019s objectives.  \n\nFor the white seabream and the Senegalese sole, the observed values of site fidelity \n\nand size of home range areas suggest that the LSMP offers an adequate level of \n\nprotection to these species. In contrast, the LSMP offers little protection to the \n\ncuttlefish, given that this species shows no site fidelity and performs movements of up \n\nto more than 15 km. For migratory species such as the cuttlefish, management in the \n\ncoastal zone alone has been shown to be insufficient in ensuring sustainable \n\nexploitation (Royer et al. 2006). In fact, Shipp (2003) has suggested that when species \n\nare too mobile to remain within the limits of an MPA, traditional fishery management \n\nmeasures such as gear restrictions, seasonal closures, or catch quotas are more \n\neffective than MPAs. \n\nThis study provided a suite of ecological information, such as habitat use, home range \n\nareas, site fidelity estimates and, especially, measures of vulnerability to fishing \n\nmortality inside the LSMP for the three contrasting species. This information is of \n\nextreme importance in understanding the implications of the LSMP for the \n\nmanagement of these species, and may be useful for the development of an adequate \n\nMPA management plan with a design and regulations tailored to their characteristics. \n\nOn the downside, this study did not provide evidence of detectable ecological effects \n\ncaused by the LSMP implementation. This is most likely to be a result of the short \n\n\n\n181 \n \n\nperiod of time in which the LSMP\u2019s regulations have been fully implemented, given \n\nthat the ecological effects of an MPA are known to be highly dependent on the age of \n\nthe MPA (Claudet et al. 2008, Vandeperre et al. 2011, Leleu et al. 2012).  \n\nIn the event more no-take areas are implemented, as suggested by some of the \n\nscenarios analyzed in chapter 7, the compliance could be harder to achieve given the \n\nalready low enforcement observed in the only no-take area implemented. The \n\nincreasing competition for fishing grounds could lead to a decrease in the number of \n\nfishing boat as observed after the implementation of the LSMP (Horta e Costa et al \n\n2013). \n\n \n\nGeneral implications for MPAs  \n\n \n\nMPAs can provide both conservation and fisheries benefits, yet they should not be \n\nconsidered a panacea. In order to achieve sustainable fisheries and to protect \n\nbiodiversity and habitats, fisheries management must include other tools such as the \n\nprohibition of damaging gears (e.g. trawl), quotas and the reduction of bycatch \n\n(Roberts et al. 2005). In fact, several authors (Shipp 2003, Roberts et al. 2005, Tetreault \n\n&amp; Ambrose 2007) regard MPAs as a supplement and not a substitute for traditional \n\nfishery management tools. According to Roberts et al. (2005) only when combining \n\nMPAs with traditional fishery management tools will conservation and fishery goals \n\nbecome united. \n\nNevertheless, in order for MPAs to function as fishery management tools, there needs \n\nto be an examination of specific instances and specific stocks to determine potential \n\nbenefits (Shipp 2003).  Therefore, the objectives of MPAs should be clearly stated and \n\nthe species and habitats they intend to protect should be identified early in the MPA \n\nestablishment process. \n\nNatural variability in marine ecosystems is huge and difficult to predict. This makes it \n\neven more difficult to understand the effectiveness of MPAs. This is why, to this date, \n\n\n\n182 \n \n\nthere is no consensus on a framework to evaluate and manage MPAs. The framework \n\npresented in this study is widely applicable to coastal MPAs, and provides managers \n\nand stakeholders with relevant and useful information not only for the implementation \n\nphase of MPAs (establishing their size and location) but also for the adaptive \n\nmanagement process of existing MPAs. This is a crucial aspect to improve the \n\nperformance of the many coastal MPAs that represent a large proportion of the more \n\nthan 5880 MPAs established throughout the world as of 2010 (Spalding et al. 2010).  \n\n \n\nFuture studies and recommendations \n\n \n\nThis study focused on three of the most important species for the local small scale \n\nartisanal fisheries, yet other locally important species such as Solea solea, Octopus \n\nvulgaris and Raja spp. should not be overlooked, as they are also important resources \n\nfor the local fisheries and information on their site fidelity and home range areas is \n\nmissing. As in the present study, gathering this type of information for those species \n\nwill provide extremely valuable inputs for the adaptive management of MPAs, such as \n\ndistribution models and vulnerability to fishing. \n\nOne of the limitations of this study is the fact that the telemetry studies did not cover \n\nthe entire range of available habitats. Not only did we have a limited number of \n\nacoustic receivers but detailed information on habitat was only available towards the \n\nend of the acoustic telemetry campaigns, preventing an optimal design of the array. \n\nThe increase of the monitored area in future studies using acoustic telemetry would \n\nallow increased habitat coverage and help to achieve longer term studies on the \n\nmovements and activity patterns of fishes. In the particular case of cuttlefish, given \n\ntheir high mobility and migrations to the nearby estuary, it would also be interesting to \n\nmonitor the Sado estuary. A larger array would also benefit acoustic telemetry studies \n\non Senegalese sole because, even though some individuals presented high site fidelity, \n\nmost were undetected for large periods of time. The fact that some of them eventually \n\nreturned to the study area suggests that they may not displace far. Therefore, \n\n\n\n183 \n \n\nincreasing the size of the monitored area would, most probably, allow for longer \n\nperiods of detection. \n\nMonitoring MPAs should be a continuous process in order to provide managers with \n\ninformation on the performance of MPAs and allow for adequate adaptive \n\nmanagement actions. Hence, we propose that experimental fishing and visual census \n\nshould be carried at least twice a year in order to properly evaluate the LSMP and to \n\nprovide managers with information on its benefits. In the future, studies focusing on \n\nthe fisheries of the adjacent areas should also be carried out in order to clarify the role \n\nof the LSMP as a fishery management tool. \n\nThe poor enforcement observed in this particular MPA might turn the initial objectives \n\nof fisheries management and biodiversity management harder to reach. During the \n\ncourse of this study, infringements of the regulations were observed on several \n\noccasions. Among these were spearfishing, the use of octopus traps too close to the \n\nshore and the use of fishing nets and longlines in partial and no-take areas. Without \n\nenforcement and compliance, an MPA is just a paper park and no protection effects or \n\nbenefits should be expected (Wood et al. 2008). Actual enforcement and compliance, \n\nand not the formal MPA establishment, must be considered as the true starting point \n\nof protection (Guidetti et al. 2008). \n\nEffective MPAs should include high-quality spawning and nursery habitats (Glazer &amp; \n\nDelgado 2006). For the species on which this study focuses such habitats are mainly \n\nfound in coastal lagoons and estuaries such as the nearby Sado estuary. Therefore, \n\nefforts should be put in place to ensure the quality and protection of these essential \n\nfish habitats. Ideally, migration corridors should be included between important \n\njuvenile and adult habitats such as the LSMP. This might implicate the identification of \n\nthose habitats outside the MPA. If these migration paths are not protected, individuals \n\nmay be susceptible to harvest when in transit or they may be unable to migrate into \n\ncritical habitats (Simpson &amp; Mapleston 2002). Given the location of the nearby Sado \n\nestuary, an area known to act as nursery/spawning area for several species, the \n\nestablishment of protected corridors between these areas and the LSMP should be \n\ninvestigated. In addition, studies on the movements\u2019 of earlier life stages (larvae, post-\n\n\n\n184 \n \n\nsettlement) of the species would help to better understand their dispersion and the \n\npotential of the LSMP as source for seeding fished areas. \n\n\n\n185 \n \n\nReferences \n\n \n\nClaudet J, Osenberg CW, Benedetti-Cecchi L, Domenici P, Garc\u00eda-Charton J-A, Perez-\nRuzafa A, Badalamenti F, Bayle-Sempere J, Brito A, Bulleri F, Culioli J-M, Dimech M, \nFalc\u00e3o JM, Guala I, Milazzo M, Sanchez-Meca J, Somerfield PJ, Stobart B, Vandeperre F, \nValle C (2008) Marine reserves: size and age do matter.
