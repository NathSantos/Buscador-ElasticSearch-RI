It is also used as a base for medicinal and \ndental preparations, a buffering and dissolution aid for dispersible tablets, a food additive and a calcium supplement. Egg shells are a rich \nsource of mineral salts, mainly calcium carbonate, which corresponds to about 94% of the shell. Layer farms produce large amounts of \nshells, whose final disposal poses a challenge from the environmental standpoint. This work was designed to evaluate the physicochemical \nand thermal properties of calcium carbonate obtained from egg shells. The findings indicated that calcium carbonate from egg shells can be \nused as an alternative pharmaceutical excipient. \nKeywords: thermal analysis; X-ray powder diffraction; egg shells; calcium carbonate.\n\nResumo\nO carbonato de c\u00e1lcio \u00e9 um excipiente farmac\u00eautico amplamente utilizado como diluente em formas farmac\u00eauticas s\u00f3lidas.

We must take into account that \neggs were not created for human being feed, but generating a \nnew life, therefore, that is the reason why they are so complete \nand nutritive food4.\n\nThe egg shell has the mainly function to protect the chicken \nembryo acting as physical barrier for inhibiting microorganisms \ninvasion and it also selects gaseous changes1,9.\n\nAccording to Thapon and Bourgeois, 1994 shell is ap-\nproximately 11% of the total weight of the egg and it presents \ncontents of: calcium carbonate (94%), calcium phosphate (1%), \nmagnesium carbonate (1%) and organic substances (4%). So, \negg shell is a rich source of mineral salts, mainly calcium \ncarbonate. Unfortunately, egg shell is an eggproduct industry \nresidue.\n\nCalcium carbonate, a pharmaceutical excipient, is mainly \nused as diluent in solid dosage forms. It is also used as a base \nfor medicinal and dental preparations, buffering and dissolu-\ntion aid in dispersible tablets, as well as food additive and \ncalcium supplement3,6,14.\n\nNowadays, there is a great interest in finding new pure \ncalcium carbonate sources6. Calcium carbonate obtained from \nbones flour, does not contain the same bioavailability of cal-\ncium obtained from synthetic sources. Calcium carbonate from \noyster shells contains lead vestige among the others potential \ntoxical elements such as aluminum, cadmium and mercury15.\nIn the other hand, egg shell has an advantage for not contain-\ning toxical elements11.\n\nEggproducts industries produce great amount of shells and \ntheir final destiny is an environmental impact challenge. This \nwork was designed to prepare and evaluate calcium carbon-\nate from egg shell because it has a potencial application in the \ndevelopment of a new option of pharmaceutical excipient. The \nlack of information on these subjects suggests that there is a \npromising area to be explored.\n\nIn this context, the main objective of this study was to \ninvestigate the physical-chemical and thermal behaviour of \ncalcium carbonate obtained from egg shell comparing to in-\ndustrial calcium carbonate.\n\n2 Experimental\n\n2.1 Production of calcium carbonate from egg shell\n\nThe chicken egg shell, raw material (Gallus gallus \ndomesticus, L.), Hy-line white eggs were obtained from Sohovos \nAB Brasil \u2013 Sorocaba \u2013 SP \u2013 Brazil eggproduct industry. The \ncalcium carbonate was produced after it had gone through \nstages of: wash, dry, grind and purification. The details on the \ntreatment of the egg shells are suppressed because the Soho-\n\n\n\nCi\u00eanc. Tecnol. Aliment., Campinas, 27(3): 658-662, jul.-set. 2007 659\n\nMurakami et al.\n\nvos eggproduct industry is in process of intellectual property \nsubmission request.\n\n2.2 Thermogravimetric analysis\n\nThe TG/DTG experiments were measured on Shimadzu \nthermobalance TGA-50. Approximately 6 mg of samples, using \na platinum pan, were carried out from 25 to 900 \u00b0C in dynamic \nnitrogen atmosphere with the flow rate of 50 mL.min\u20131 and \nheating rate of 10 \u00b0C.min\u20131.\n\nNon-isothermal kinetic study was performed by applica-\ntion of Ozawa\u2019s method13. The kinetic study of both calcium \ncarbonate, obtained from egg shell and industrial, were evalu-\nated by thermogravimetric curves. The samples were heated \nat different heating rates (2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 \u00b0C.min\u20131) to \ntarget temperature 900 \u00b0C under dynamic nitrogen atmosphere \nof 50 mL.min\u20131. The equipment was preliminarily calibrated \nwith standard reference of calcium oxalate.\n\n2.3 X- ray powder diffraction (XRPD)\n\nThe XRPD patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractome-\nter (Siemens model D5000). The samples were irradiated with \nmonochromatized Cuk  radiation (1.54056 A\u00b0) and analyzed \nbetween 10-80\u00b0 (2 theta). The voltage, current and pass time \nused were 40 kw, 40 mA and 1 s, respectively.\n\n2.4 Morphology of particle\n\nMicroscopic observation of both calcium carbonates was \nperformed under a microscope (Zeiss Axiostar Plus, Japan). \nThe samples were mounted on a glass slide, viewed under nor-\nmal light and pictures taken with a Zeiss MC80DX camera. \n\n3 Results and discussion\nThe thermal analysis method was used, as well as X-ray \n\npowder diffraction and microscopy. These combining tech-\nniques provide quick and proper interpretations, offering the \nthermal stability, molecular organization, particle size and the \npossibility of analytical quantification of substances7,8,12. The \nproperties of calcium carbonate obtained of the egg shell was \ncompared with the industrial calcium carbonate, purchased \nfrom LABSYNTH, batch number 71148 USP-FCC.\n\nThe thermogravimetric curve TG/DTG obtained for in-\ndustrial calcium carbonate (Figure 1a) showed a thermal \nstability up to 600 \u00b0C with a small mass loss ( m = 1.8%) \ncorresponding to volatile material. The decomposition \nprocess occurs in a single step in a defined way, between \ntemperature range from 601 to 770 \u00b0C, with a m = 41.7% \ndue to carbon dioxide release, given rise to calcium oxide: \nCaCO\n\n3\n(s) heat CO\n\n2\n(g) + CaO(s). The calcium carbonate \n\nusually decomposes at temperatures over 600 \u00b0C without fu-\nsion process10.\n\nThe TG/DTG curve obtained for egg shell calcium carbon-\nate is seen in Figure 1b. The curve showed thermal stability \nup to 630 \u00b0C with a mass loss of m = 2.6% referring to \nvolatile material. The thermal decomposition process occurs \n\nat the temperature range from 636 to 795 \u00b0C with mass loss \nm = 42.5%, which corresponds to carbon dioxide release, in \n\na single step, in a defined way. \n\nThrough the thermogravimetric analysis it is possible to \nevidence that industrial calcium carbonate decomposes at \ntemperature about 30 \u00b0C less than the calcium carbonate ob-\ntained from egg shell, with DTG\n\npeak\n of 749.9 and 771.5 \u00b0C for \n\nindustrial and egg shell product, respectively.\n\n0\n\n0\n\n200\n\n200\n\n400\n\n400\n\n600\n\n600\n\n800\n\n800\n\nTemp (\u00b0C)\n\nTemp (\u00b0C)\n\nT\nG\n\nA\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nT\nG\n\nA\n (\n\n%\n)\n\n60\n\n60\n\n80\n\n80\n\n100\n\n100\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n\u20130.2\n\n\u20130.4\n\n\u20130.6\n\nD\nrT\n\nG\nA\n\n m\ng/\n\nm\nin\n\nD\nrT\n\nG\nA\n\n m\ng/\n\nm\nin\n\n4.5\n\n4.0\n\n3.5\n\nTGA2\nDrTGA2\n\nTGA\nDrTGA\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure 1.

Approximately 6 mg of samples, using a platinum pan, were \ncarried out from 25 to 900 \u00b0C in dynamic nitrogen atmosphere with the \nflow rate of 50 mL.min\u20131 and heating rate of 10 \u00b0C.min\u20131, a) Industrial \ncalcium carbonate, and b) Egg shell calcium carbonate.\n\nThe kinetic data were calculated from plotting the mass \nloss vs. temperature of TG curves obtained to different heating \nrates for both calcium carbonates. Figures 2 and 3, demonstrate \nthe superposition of TG curves obtained to industrial and egg \nshell calcium carbonate, respectively. The inserted figure dem-\nonstrates the linear tendency of reaction mechanism. \n\nThe activation energy (Ea) and Arrhenius frequency factor \n(Z) were calculated by Ozawa\u2019s method for each five TG curves. \nThe activation energy was obtained from a plot of logarithms \nof heating rates (A) as a function of the inverse of temperature \n(1/T) for a constant G(x), in which G(x) is the integrated form \nof the conversion dependence function, f(x). The Ea values \nwere 47.83 kcal.mol\u20131  0.6% and 49.25 kcal.mol\u20131  0.2% for \nindustrial and egg shell calcium carbonate, respectively. It was \nevidenced that the activation energy required for the decom-\nposition process of egg shell product is higher than industrial, \nwhich pronounces its largest thermal stability. The Arrhenius \nfrequency confirms the stability of egg shell calcium carbonate; \nthe obtained results were 3.469 x 109 for industrial calcium \ncarbonate and 5.011 x 109 for egg shell calcium carbonate. For \nboth products the reaction of degradation was governed by a \nzero order kinetic.\n\n\n\nCi\u00eanc. Tecnol.

The diffractograms in Figure 4\nindicate that diffraction patterns of industrial and egg shell\n\ncalcium carbonate have similar peaks. The patterns can be put \nupon being the differences only found in the intensity of the\npeaks.

The varia-\n\ntion of samples reflections is small being larger in the relative \nintensity. Studies have been considering that the similarity of \npatterns is established if the scattering angles of the strongest \nreflections obtained from an sample agree to about  0.2 de-\ngrees with that of the reference material; and if the relative \nintensities of these reflections do not vary more than 20%2,5.\nThe d-distance that considers the distance among the crystal \nplans is similar between carbonates, however, the values of the \n\negg shell calcium carbonate is slightly smaller.\n\n4 Conclusions\nThrough the thermogravimetric analysis it was evidenced \n\nthat industrial calcium carbonate decomposes at a tempera-\nture of about 30 \u00b0C less than the calcium carbonate obtained \nfrom egg shell. The obtained kinetics parameters (Ea) and (Z) \nconfirm that egg shell calcium carbonate is more stable com-\nparing with the industrial. The XRPD analysis demonstrates \nthat both products have similar cristallinity and the microscopy \nindicates that egg shell carbonate has largest particle size. The \nresults showed that both products have similar physical chemi-\ncal parameters, indicating that egg shell product should be an \nalternative of pharmaceutical excipient. Furthermore, studies \nhave been accomplished about the influence of the egg shell \ncalcium carbonate in the quality of pharmaceutical products \nlike cosmetics.\n\nReferences\n1.
