Novos refrigerantes, \nmais \u201camigos\u201d do ambiente, l\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos, uma nova classe de solventes \nou perfluorocarbonetos, mol\u00e9culas capazes de dissolver suficiente oxig\u00e9nio \npara poderem ser utilizadas como substitutas do sangue ou como fonte de \noxig\u00e9nio em processos biotecnol\u00f3gicos ou ainda como surfactantes em \nprocessos de extrac\u00e7\u00e3o supercr\u00edtica com di\u00f3xido de carbono, s\u00e3o apenas \nalguns dos novos exemplos. \n\nPara o design correcto de produtos e processos envolvendo estes novos \nflu\u00eddos, o conhecimento de algumas das suas propriedades termof\u00edsicas \u00e9 \nfundamental. Embora a medi\u00e7\u00e3o experimental seja o procedimento mais \nrigoroso para a determina\u00e7\u00e3o de qualquer propriedade termof\u00edsica, muitas \ndas vezes, estas medi\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o morosas e caras. As gamas de temperatura, \npress\u00e3o e composi\u00e7\u00e3o de interesse podem ainda ser tais que tornam as \nmedi\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais inexequ\u00edveis sendo a solu\u00e7\u00e3o mais conveniente a \nutiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo te\u00f3rico, emp\u00edrico ou misto que devolve o valor da \npropriedade termof\u00edsica nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es desejadas com uma razo\u00e1vel \nexactid\u00e3o. \n\nO contributo desta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de doutoramento \u00e9 maioritariamente para \no estudo de mol\u00e9culas lineares de diferentes tamanhos de cadeia, com um \nespecial \u00eanfase para misturas assim\u00e9tricas. A fam\u00edlia dos n-alcanos por \napresentar um imenso interesse industrial a n\u00edvel da ind\u00fastria petrol\u00edfera e \npetroqu\u00edmica, quer porque as suas propriedades permitem a sua utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o \ncomo materiais termoactivos em isolamento ou armazenamento de energia, \nquer ainda por ser uma fam\u00edlia modelo para tantas outras mol\u00e9culas, como \nsurfactantes, \u00e1cidos gordos ou pol\u00edmeros, foi seleccionada para esse efeito. \n\nV\u00e1rias medi\u00e7\u00f5es foram realizadas em sistemas cuja escassez ou \ninexist\u00eancia de dados experimentais foi verificada. Tens\u00f5es superficiais, \ntens\u00f5es interfaciais, densidades e viscosidades da fase l\u00edquida foram \ndeterminadas para um conjunto significativo de flu\u00eddos em gamas alargadas \nde temperatura e composi\u00e7\u00e3o, tendo sido dada especial aten\u00e7\u00e3o a sistemas \nassim\u00e9tricos de n-alcanos e a algumas frac\u00e7\u00f5es de petr\u00f3leo, representativas \nde sistemas reais. \n\nDiferentes metodologias foram adoptadas para a modela\u00e7\u00e3o dos \nresultados obtidos, com o cuidado de avaliar alguns dos modelos \ntermodin\u00e2micos que constituem o estado-da-arte, tendo sido demonstrado \nque um novo modelo baseado no Princ\u00edpio dos Estados Correspondentes \nintroduz melhorias consider\u00e1veis na modela\u00e7\u00e3o quando comparado com \nmodelos convencionais. \n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n- ix - \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n\nabstract \n \n\nAs a result of the continuous scientific and technological developments,  \nseveral new fluids of interest are showing up every day. New refrigerants, more \nenvironmentally friendly, ionic liquids, a new class of solvents or \nperfluoroalkanes, molecules able to dissolve enough oxygen in order to be \nused as blood substitutes or oxygen carrier agents in biotechnological \nprocesses or as surfactants in supercritical carbon dioxide extraction, are a few \nexamples. \n\nFor the correct product and process design of these new fluids, knowledge \nof some thermophysical properties are required. Although the experimental \nmeasurement is the most rigorous procedure for evaluating any thermophysical \nproperty, frequently these are expensive and time-consuming. The \ntemperature, pressure and composition ranges of interest may also be so \nbroad that the measurements may be unfeasible, with a common solution \nbeing the use of a theoretical, empirical or semi-empirical model that returns \nthe thermophysical property at the desired conditions with a considerable \naccuracy. \n\nThis thesis contributes to the study of various thermophysical properties of \nnonpolar molecules of different chain lengths, with a special emphasis on \nasymmetric mixtures. The n-alkane family was chosen for that purpose since it  \nhas a vast industrial interest, starting from the petrochemical industry to \ntermoactive phase change materials, for energy storage and release. It can \nalso be regarded as a reference family for studying other molecules such as \nsurfactants, fatty acids or polymers. \n\nA number of experimental measurements were performed in systems \nwere data deficiency was found. Properties such as vapor-liquid and liquid-\nliquid interfacial tensions and liquid phase densities and viscosities were \nmeasured for a significant number of fluids in broad ranges of temperature and \ncomposition. A special emphasis was put on asymmetric n-alkane mixtures and \nsome petroleum fractions, representative of real systems. \n\nSeveral methodologies were adopted for modeling the obtained results, \nand for that purpose some state-of-the-art thermodynamic models were \nevaluated. As will be demonstrated an improved Corresponding States model  \nenhanced considerably model accuracy. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nContents \n\n   - xi - \n\nContents \n\n \n\nLIST OF SYMBOLS ........................................................................................................................XIII \n\nLIST OF FIGURES ........................................................................................................................

In fact, in \n\na short period of time, the chemical industry has changed from the production of a tiny \n\nnumber of small molecules to the large-scale production of a huge number of chemicals \n\nwith broad compositional, structural and size differences. \n\nThermophysical properties are frequently required both for product and process \n\ndesign, and in many cases these are scarce or unavailable. During process design, \n\nknowledge of thermophysical properties is essential for determining the optimum process \n\nconditions, concerning steps as different as distillation, extraction, adsorption, reaction, \n\nheat and mass transfer and fluid transport. From the viewpoint of product design, various \n\nproperties may determine the selection of a specific fluid for a particular purpose, for \n\nexample viscosity for lubricants, surface tension for detergents, vapor pressure for \n\nperfumes or thermal conductivity for insulating materials. To develop products with \n\nimproved performance, we thus need a good knowledge of the function-determining \n\nthermophysical properties. \n\nOne of the most well documented families of chemicals is that of n-alkanes. Many of \n\nthe measurements available so far were done due to the importance that alkanes have for \n\nthe petroleum industry. In the past, the focus has been on light oils and for this reason data \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction  \n\n- xxvi - \n\nfor compounds above n-hexadecane (n-C16H34) are scarce with the available data covering \n\nonly a narrow temperature range. \n\nAdvances in oil extraction technology, founded on the progressive reservoir depletion, \n\nare enabling the additional recovery of heavier oils, rising oil lifetime (Ali, 2003; \n\nBabadagli, 2003). The mixture of heavier and lighter components makes the new oils \n\nheavier and more asymmetric, and thus, the increasing interest in heavier and asymmetric \n\nn-alkane mixtures. \n\nMixtures containing lighter and heavier compounds, can also be found at another \n\nindustries such as those producing paints and polymers. \n\nAnother recent interest on the use of heavy n-alkanes, in the form of the cheap paraffin \n\nwax, is related to energy management (storage and release) provided by phase change \n\nmaterials (Farid et al., 2004). In these materials, a broad melting temperature range is used \n\nto store or release latent heat by means of the solid-liquid phase change. Typically these \n\nmaterials should have a large melting latent heat, high thermal conductivity, a melting \n\ntemperature in the desired working range, melt congruently with no subcooling, be low in \n\ncost, chemically stable, non-toxic and non-corrosive. Some difficulties are now being \n\naddressed, particularly those related to low thermal conductivity, density change, stability \n\nof properties under cycling, flammability and, less frequently, subcooling  \n\n(Farid et al., 2004). Some of the applications of paraffin wax as a phase change material \n\nare solar energy storage, temperature controlled clothing for athletes and campers and \n\nhousehold heating and insulation. \n\nAs the industrial interest in most of the heavier components was small till recently, the \n\navailable experimental data is particularly reduced. Because the experimental measurement \n\nof thermophysical properties is an expensive and time-consuming procedure, the \n\nalternative is to select models from which the desired properties can be obtained within the \n\nrequired accuracy. Although several models have been proposed, it is still essential to carry \n\nout some experimental measurements on new systems of interest in order to assess their \n\nlimitations and provide a basis for the development of improved models. \n\nDuring the work conducted for this thesis a particular attention was devoted to two \n\nsomewhat neglected thermophysical properties: interfacial tension and viscosity. Some \n\nliquid density measurements were performed and vapor pressures, thermal conductivities \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction \n\n   - xxvii - \n\nand speeds of sounds were addressed on the modeling part. Thermal analysis of some \n\npetroleum distillation cuts by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) were also \n\nperformed. \n\nThe importance of interfacial tension for the petroleum industry extends far beyond \n\nthe extraction process, when oil has to travel through capillary channels and where this \n\ntype of flow is strongly dominated by surface tension effects. In fact, it is not unusual in \n\nthe extraction of crudes to add surfactants to modify the interfacial properties between \n\ncrude oil and the geological reservoir (Farid et al., 2004). Other operations such as \n\nmultiphase transport in pipelines, adsorption, distillation or extraction also rely on this \n\nproperty. Outside the refinery, the environmental concerns about oil spills, both on sea and \n\nfresh waters, are a field where the study of the oil-water interface can provide important \n\ninformation, since it can determine the path, transport mechanisms and fate of organic \n\npollutants in the environment. Other industries were interfacial tensions arising from long \n\nalkyl chains are important are those producing coatings, paints, detergents, cosmetics and \n\nagrochemicals. \n\nOther valuable properties to model oil extraction from reservoirs are viscosity and \n\nliquid density. The importance of viscosity is well known. All equations expressing the \n\nflow of fluids contain this property, and several product characteristics can be largely \n\ndetermined by its magnitude. Lubricants and paints are examples of products for which the \n\nviscosity is one of the key properties. Generally, it is much easier to find open literature \n\nstudies of phase equilibria rather than studies on non-equilibrium properties such as \n\nviscosity. Although literature data have been substantially increased over the last few \n\ndecades, information about asymmetric or heavy systems is still scarce. \n\nThis thesis is organized in three parts, that deal separately with the experimental \n\ndetails, results and discussion (Part I), data correlation (Part II) and modeling of \n\nexperimental data using some state-of-the-art and new thermodynamic models (Part III). \n\nThis separation allows the reader to select one or more chapters without having to go \n\nthrough the entire text. \n\nPart I details the experimental apparatuses used to measure vapor-liquid and liquid-\n\nliquid interfacial tensions, viscosities and liquid densities on a group of pure and mixed n-\n\nalkanes, with a special attention devoted to asymmetric mixtures. Measurements were \n\n\n\nGeneral Introduction  \n\n- xxviii - \n\nperformed in broad temperature and composition ranges and results are reported on tables \n\ntogether with their estimated uncertainties. Some chain length effects on the results will be \n\ndiscussed in this chapter. Finally some measurements on petroleum distillation cuts, \n\nrepresentative of real fluids will also be presented. \n\nPart II deals with data correlation. An overview of critical properties and an \n\nassessment of correlations to extend the available data for those n-alkanes for which there \n\nis no experimental evidence is first presented and discussed, since these are fundamental \n\nfor modeling purposes. Afterwards, correlating relations among some of the measured \n\nproperties are presented. Some interesting results relating surface tension to viscosity will \n\nbe presented at this point showing that its possible to relate equilibrium properties with \n\ntransport properties. \n\nPart III addresses various thermodynamic models for the estimation of thermophysical \n\nproperties, with a special attention devoted to the properties measured on Part I: interfacial \n\ntensions, viscosities and liquid densities. Some emphasis was put on corresponding states \n\nmodels (section III.2) since these are the most versatile (the same formalism can be applied \n\nfor different properties), require a small amount of experimental information, and are, in \n\nspite of their simplicity, surprisingly accurate. It will be shown that with a simple, \n\ntheoretically sound extension, these models can be selected for the prediction of several \n\nproperties of pure and mixed, lighter and heavier n-alkanes with average deviations \n\ncomparable to the experimental uncertainties. \n\nOn section III.3 preliminary results on the coupling of the gradient theory of fluid \n\ninterfaces with an association equation of state, the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) \n\nequation of state for the simultaneous modeling of the equilibrium pressures and densities, \n\nand interfacial tensions will be presented. The advantage of this combination is the \n\npossibility of modeling the important aqueous-hydrocarbon liquid-liquid (and vapor-liquid) \n\ninterfaces for more complex systems, were phase equilibrium needs to be considered. \n\nResults will also be presented from the friction theory for viscosity modeling, a new \n\nstate-of the-art model based on the attractive and repulsive pressures calculated from a \n\ncubic equation of state.

Of course, it is \n\nimpossible (both expensive and time consuming) to carry out all the required experimental \n\nmeasurements on all interesting molecules and their mixtures in broad temperature, \n\npressure and composition conditions. And the uncertainty required for the desired property \n\nmay not always be small. For this reason, models are regularly used, but, since models \n\nalways introduce some simplifications, one should first check their performance for the \n\nestimation of a small amount of experimental data, representative of the system(s) under \n\nstudy. \n\nIn the particular case of asymmetric n-alkane mixtures, surface tension and viscosity \n\nare among the most important thermophysical properties, those that present the smallest \n\namount of experimental information. Liquid densities can easily be found for some \n\nmixtures of lighter components, but when one of the components involved is heavier than \n\nn-eicosane, the amount of experimental data is again, scarce. \n\nPure, binary and ternary mixtures as well as some petroleum distillation cuts from \n\ndifferent origins were measured. Compositions and thermal behavior of the later were \n\ndetermined using Gas Chromatography (Hewlett Packard 6890) and Differential Scanning \n\nCalorimetry (Setaram DSC 141). \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 4 - \n\nLighter pure n-alkanes were chosen to evaluate the accuracy of the measuring \n\nmethods, while heavier n-alkanes were measured since data for most of these fluids are \n\nstill lacking. Some mixtures, especially asymmetric n-alkane mixtures were selected. For 6 \n\nbinary and 2 ternary mixtures all of the referred properties were measured at the same \n\ncompositions and temperatures in order to examine the effect of chain length and \n\nasymmetry. Ternary mixtures, consisting of n-heptane (or n-decane) + n-eicosane + n-\n\ntetracosane were prepared with equal mole fractions of n-eicosane and n-tetracosane in \n\norder to compare the results with the binary mixture n-heptane (or n-decane) + n-docosane. \n\nCrude oil fractions were chosen to represent real fluids. The results obtained will serve as a \n\nbasis to the extrapolation, of the selected models to systems of practical interest. \n\nA viscometer and a densimeter from Anton Paar and a Nima tensiometer were chosen \n\nfor the measurements reported in this chapter. Although other measuring techniques with \n\nhigher precisions can be selected for the measurement of these thermophysical properties \n\n(Rusanov, 1996; Wakeham et al., 1991), these equipment have shown to present the right \n\nbalance between accuracy, precision, measuring time and amount of sample. One big \n\ndisadvantage of these apparatuses is that measurements can only be performed at a set of \n\ndifferent temperatures, without any pressure control, with the system pressure being \n\nroughly the atmospheric pressure. So, the reported results that will follow are not \n\nsaturation-line properties. Still, as the dependence of the selected properties on pressure is \n\nsmall in the considered temperature range (283.15 K \u2013 343.15 K), results can also be \n\ncompared with saturation results as will be latter shown. \n\nMeasurements were performed from 283.15 K (or slightly above the fluid melting \n\npoint) up to 343.15 K in temperature intervals of 10 K. This temperature range, although \n\nsuperiorly limited by the working range of the Anton Paar densimeter, shall present \n\nenough experimental information for describing the temperature influence on the selected \n\nthermophysical properties. It also permits to gather important information about the low-\n\ntemperature behavior of the selected fluids. \n\nFor the considered binary mixtures, the full composition range was studied, allowing \n\nsome insights about the composition effects on the measured properties. \n\nAll the results will be presented according to the International System of Units \n\n(Taylor, 1995), together with their estimated uncertainties, by the use of the law of the \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n- 5 - \n\npropagation of uncertainty (Taylor et al., 1994), considering the individual uncertainties of \n\nthe variables involved on the measurements. These calculations, together with a \n\ncomparison with available literature data will give a good overview on the precision and \n\naccuracy of the reported results. \n\n \n\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nExperimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n- 7 - \n\n?\n\n\"If your experiment needs statistics, then you ought to have done \n\na better experiment\" \n\nErnest Rutherford (1871 - 1937), physicist?\n\n?\n\n \n\n \n\nVapor\u2013liquid and liquid-liquid interfacial tensions, liquid densities and viscosities are \n\nreported for some pure, binary and ternary n-alkane mixtures, and some petroleum \n\ndistillation cuts representative of real systems. Interfacial tensions were measured using a \n\nNIMA DST 9005 Dynamic Surface Tensiometer based on the Wilhelmy plate method \n\n(vapor-liquid interfaces) and the Du No\u00fcy ring method (liquid-liquid interfaces). Liquid \n\ndensities were determined using an Anton Paar DMA 58 vibrating U-tube densimeter and \n\nviscosities from an Anton Paar AMV8 rolling ball viscometer. \n\nThermal analysis from Differential Scanning Calorimetry using a  \n\nSetaram DSC 141 calorimeter and compositions from gas chromatography using an \n\nHewlett Packard 6890 chromatograph of the reported petroleum distillation cuts are also \n\npresented and discussed. \n\nResults are reported on tables together with their estimated uncertainties. \n\n \n\nI.2. Experimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n \n\nI.2.1. Interfacial Tension \n\n \n\nA NIMA DST 9005 tensiometer from NIMA Technology, Ltd. was used for these \n\nmeasurements. It incorporates a microbalance (Peterson, 1997) able to read force within \n\n10-6 mN, which was operated on the Wilhelmy plate method (Rusanov et al., 1996) for the \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 8 - \n\nliquid-vapor interfacial tensions and on the Du No\u00fcy ring method (Rusanov et al., 1996; \n\nHarkins et al., 1930; Freud et al., 1930; Huh et al., 1975) for the liquid-liquid interfacial \n\ntensions (Figure I. 1). \n\nThe plate (or ring) is connected to the microbalance and afterwards immersed and \n\ndetached from the evaluating interface, resulting on a total force (F) which, when the \n\ncontact angle (? ) is zero (Figure I. 1), can be separated into the following three \n\ncomponents: \n\n \n\nlenghtwettedtensionerfacialintthrustupweightF \u00d7+?=    (I. 1) \n\n \n\nBefore making any measurements the balance is zeroed, thereby eliminating the \n\nweight term. \n\nAt the interface, the up thrust is zero and so, the force measured by the balance is only \n\ndue to the interfacial tension: \n\n \n\nlenghtwettedtensionerfacialintF erfaceint \u00d7=      (I. 2) \n\n \n\nGenerally, the interfacial tension is thus given by: \n\n \n\nlenghtwetted\n\nF erfaceint=?         (I. 3) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the interfacial tension, in N.m-1. \n\nWhen the contact angle between the ring (or plate) and the measuring interface is \n\ndifferent from zero (Figure I. 1), the force measured by the balance has to be corrected: \n\n \n\n\n\nExperimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n- 9 - \n\n( )?\u00d7\n=?\n\ncoslenghtwetted\n\nF erfaceint\n       (I. 4) \n\n \n\nIn the Wilhelmy plate method, the wetted length is equal to the plate perimeter: \n\n \n\n( )thicknesswidth2\nF erfaceint\n\n+\u00d7\n=?        (I. 5) \n\n \n\nwhile for the Du No\u00fcy ring, it is equal to the sum of the inner and outer ring diameters: \n\n \n\n( )( )t2dd\nF erfaceint\n\n??+?\n=?         (I. 6) \n\n \n\nwhere d is the ring outer diameter and t is the wire thickness. \n\nThe Wilhelmy plate method is an absolute method, since it does not require any \n\nhydrostatic correction. This would suggest using this method for all the measurements. \n\nUnfortunately, only with some liquid-vapor interfaces we can guarantee that the angle ? \n\nformed between the lower edge of the plate and the interface is zero. \n\nTwo reasons were thus involved in the selection of different measuring methods for \n\nliquid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces. The first is the need of density data required for \n\nthe ring method, and not needed with the plate, making the last very convenient for \n\nvapor-liquid interfaces were complete wetting of the Wilhelmy plate can be obtained  \n\n(?  = 0). On the other hand, for liquid \u2013liquid interfaces, complete wetting is best assured \n\nby the use of the Du No\u00fcy ring where, due to its circular shape and the largest wetting \n\nperimeter, can be withdrawn with a zero contact angle. However, with this method, an \n\nhydrostatic correction is required due to the pull up of measuring fluid on the inner side of \n\nthe ring. \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 10 - \n\n \n\nFigure I. 1: NIMA DST 9005 tensiometer (up). Wilhelmy plate (middle) and Du No\u00fcy ring \n(bottom). \n\n\n\nExperimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n- 11 - \n\nIt was shown (Rusanov et al., 1996, Huh et al., 1975, Martin et al., 1999) that this \n\ncorrection depends on the difference of mass densities between the involved phases, and it \n\nis automatically performed by the tensiometer acquisition software after inputting the \n\ndensity difference. \n\nPlate perimeter and ring diameter and thickness were first measured within \u00b110 \u00b5m \n\nand are introduced in the acquisition software. Platinum plates and rings were used. \n\nDimensions of the Wilhelmy plate were 20.20 mm width and 0.18 mm thickness and those \n\nof the Du No\u00fcy ring 20.75 mm diameter and 500 \u00b5m wire thickness. From the force \n\nmeasurements and the plate (or ring) dimensions, this tensiometer automatically returns \n\ninterfacial tension values. \n\nThis tensiometer can also be used to measure force, contact angles and dynamic \n\ninterfacial tension. Several measurement parameters can be easily changed giving this \n\nequipment considerable versatility (Martin et al., 1999). \n\nAll of the used chemicals were commercial products with a stated purity of at least \n\n98%: n-heptane (Riedel de Ha\u00ebn, ?  99 %), n-decane (Aldrich, ?  99 %), n-hexadecane \n\n(Sigma, ?  99 %), n-eicosane (Sigma, ?  99 %), n-docosane (Fluka, ?  98 %) and  \n\nn-tetracosane (Fluka, ?  99 %). Liquid room-temperature n-alkanes (n-heptane, n-decane, \n\nand n-hexadecane) were dried over molecular sieves. For the vapor-liquid interfacial \n\ntensions no further purification was carried out, while for liquid-liquid (water + n-alkane) \n\nmeasurements, the n-alkanes were first purified by column chromatography with basic \n\nalumina, since it was earlier reported that trace contaminants in the n-alkanes could be \n\nenriched in the aqueous-n-alkane interface, reducing the interfacial tensions  \n\n(Goebel et al., 1997; Gaonkar et al., 1984). For the n-alkanes heavier than n-C16H34, no \n\nsuch effect was observed, while for the lower ones, results were considerably improved \n\nafter column chromatography. \n\nFor the measurements, approximately 50 cm3 of each liquid phase were introduced in \n\na thermostated glass vessel. Temperature was controlled within 0.01 K by an external \n\nPt100 probe directly immersed on the system and connected to an HAAKE F6 circulator. \n\nThe accuracy of this temperature measuring system was assured by calibration against a \n\ncertified Thermometrics S10 thermistor. Average absolute deviation (Eq. I.7) was smaller \n\nthan 0.04 with a maximum deviation of -0.07 K at 319.72 K: \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 12 - \n\n100\nX\n\nXX\n\nm\n\n1\nAAD%\n\na\n\na \u00d7\n?\n\n= ?        (I. 7) \n\n \n\nwhere m is the number of data points, X is the measured temperature in K and \n\nsubscript a stands for the accepted value from the thermistor. \n\nMixtures were carefully prepared by weighting the components in a Mettler Toledo \n\nAB204 analytical balance (\u00b1 0.0001 g). Uncertainty in mole fraction was calculated to be \n\nless than 2\u00d710-5. \n\nBalance and tensiometer were calibrated with masses provided by the manufacturers. \n\nBefore the measurements, the glass vessel was carefully cleaned with water and \n\ndetergent to completely remove the previous sample. After that, the vessel was washed \n\nwith plenty of distilled water and dried before use. The glass vessel was regularly soaked \n\nin 5M nitric acid in order to remove any extra contaminant. Surfactant-free paper was used \n\nfor cleaning purposes. \n\nSpecial precautions were taken to avoid evaporation of the more volatile components \n\nsuch as n-heptane and n-decane during the mixture measurements. For that purpose, the \n\ntensiometer was hermetically closed and a small portion of these components was \n\nintroduced inside the tensiometer chamber in order to saturate the gas phase. Humidity was \n\nremoved from the tensiometer chamber using dried silica gel. \n\nBefore each vapor-liquid measurement, the plate was flamed in a Bunsen burner in \n\norder to eliminate contaminants. \n\nFor the liquid-liquid interfacial tensions the Du No\u00fcy ring was immersed in an acidic \n\nmixture (20% conc. HCl + 20% conc. HNO3) for 15 minutes and after that washed with \n\nplenty of ultra-pure water, since it was reported previously that flame cleaning could \n\npromote the adsorption of non-polar species to the ring while measuring  \n\naqueous-hydrocarbon interfaces (Gaonkar et al., 1984; Lunkenheimer, 1989). \n\nThe interface was cleaned by suction with a Pasteur pipette and discarded. This allows \n\nthe removal of some surface-active contaminants and the formation of a new and clean \n\ninterface. \n\n\n\nExperimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n- 13 - \n\nDuring the measurements, the Wilhelmy plate or the Du No\u00fcy ring were immersed and \n\ndetached from the interface, after the liquid level was automatically determined by the \n\ntensiometer. Interfacial tension was obtained from the maximum value of the plot \n\ninterfacial tension vs. immersion depth while the plate or ring was detached. For each \n\nsystem, at least 9 interfacial tension values were recorded, from which an average was \n\ntaken. \n\nFor the water-n-alkane interfacial tensions, the first step was the introduction of  \n\nultra-pure water on the measuring vessel. After that, the ring was immersed to determine \n\nthe liquid level and then it was totally immersed on the aqueous phase so that the \n\nmeasuring part of the Du No\u00fcy ring never touched the n-alkane phase over it. The n-alkane \n\nwas then carefully transferred to the measuring vessel, and after a period of time necessary \n\nto reach the desired thermal equilibrium at the target temperature, plus 15 minutes, the \n\nmeasurement started. Since with the Du No\u00fcy ring the maximum force is obtained without \n\nbreaking the interface, the ring was always wetted by the aqueous phase. If, somehow, the \n\nring broke the interface during the measurement, all the procedure was repeated, since the \n\ncontact with the organic phase makes the ring hydrophobic (Gaonkar et al., 1984 ; \n\nLunkenheimer, 1989). \n\nAn initial set of pure component measurements was carried out to evaluate the ability \n\nof the measuring system to reproduce literature data. Pure component interfacial tension \n\nwas measured from 273.15 K (or above the melting point) up to 343.15 K. \n\nResults are reported and compared with literature values (Jasper et al.,1953; McLure \n\net al. 1982; Jasper, 1972; Koefoed et al. 1958; \u00c1guila-Hernandez, 1987;  \n\nJasper et al., 1955). in Table I. 1 and Figure I. 2. \n\nThe uncertainty reported in this table heading (\u00b1 0.03 mN.m-1) is the maximum \n\nuncertainty found from all data. This was evaluated using the law of propagation of \n\nuncertainty in which force, plate dimensions and temperature were considered (Taylor et \n\nal., 1994). \n\nDeviations were calculated using percent average absolute deviations  \n\n(% AAD, Eq. I.7), where m is the number of data points, X is the interfacial tension and the \n\nsubscript a stands for the accepted (literature) values. An overall average absolute \n\ndeviation of 1.2 % was obtained. No literature data was found for n-tetracosane. The \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 14 - \n\nmaximum deviation was 2.6 % for n-hexadecane at 293.15 K, compared with the data from \n\nKoefoed et al. (1958). In Figure I. 2 n-heptane results are presented, where data from \n\nGrigoryev et al., (1992) taken at different temperatures from our measurements, are also \n\nincluded. The measured data agrees with the data previously reported as much as the \n\ndifferent sets of data agree between themselves. \n\nIt should be noted that for n-docosane and n-tetracosane, at the lowest temperatures, \n\nsurface tension decreases with decreasing temperature, an opposite trend to what is \n\ngenerally found. This phenomenon is particular of some heavy n-alkanes with chain length \n\n14 &lt;n ?  50, some alcohols and liquid crystals and is ascribed to surface freezing, where \n\nthe surface presents solid ordering before the bulk liquid does, around 3 K above the \n\nmelting point (Penfold, 2001; Wu et al., 1993; Earnshaw et al., 1992). \n\nFigure I. 2: Surface tension of n-C7H16: ? , this work, +, Grigoryev et al., 1992; x, Jasper, 1972; ?\n Jasper et al., 1955; ?, Koefoed et al., 1958; * McLure et al., 1982. \n\n13.0\n\n17.0\n\n21.0\n\n25.0\n\n250 270 290 310 330 350\n\nT/K\n\n?? ??\n/m\n\nN\n.m\n\n-1\n\n\n\nExperimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n- 15 - \n\nTable I. 1: Pure n-alkane interfacial tension and comparison with literature \n\n?/?/?/?/mN.m-1    \n\nn-alkane T/K \nthis \n\nworka \nJasper et al. \n\n(1953) \nMcLure et al. \n\n(1982) \nJasper \n(1972) \n\nKoefoed et al. \n(1958) \n\n\u00c1guila-Hernandez \n(1987) \n\nJasper et al. \n(1955) \n\n% AADb \n\n273.15 22.28 22.31     22.10 \n283.15 21.37 21.30  21.12    \n293.15 20.50 20.28 20.21 20.14 20.30   \n303.15 19.47 19.27 19.17 19.17 19.31   \n313.15 18.42 18.25 18.19 18.18    \n323.15 17.41 17.24 17.18 17.20    \n333.15 16.42 16.22 16.19 16.22    \n\nn-C7H16 \n\n343.15 15.32   15.24    \n\n1.1 \n\n          \n293.15 24.09 23.89  23.83    \n303.15 23.29 22.98  22.91    \n313.15 22.33 22.06  21.99    \n323.15 21.43 21.14  21.07    \n333.15 20.54 20.22  20.15    \n\nn-C10H22 \n\n343.15 19.66   19.23    \n\n1.5 \n\n          \n293.15 28.11 27.64  27.47 27.40   \n303.15 27.02 26.79  26.62 26.63   \n313.15 26.23 25.95  25.76    \n323.15 25.29 25.11  24.91  25.08  \n333.15 24.40 24.27  24.06  24.25  \n343.15 23.51 23.42  23.20  23.38  \n\nn-C16H34 \n\n        \n\n1.3 \n\n313.15 27.58   27.21    \n323.15 26.67   26.38  26.52  \n333.15 25.85   25.54  25.58  \n\nn-C20H42 \n\n343.15 25.01   24.71  24.71  \n\n1.1 \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 16 - \n\n?/?/?/?/mN.m-1    \n\nn-alkane T/K \nthis \n\nworka \nJasper et al. \n\n(1953) \nMcLure et al. \n\n(1982) \nJasper \n(1972) \n\nKoefoed et al. \n(1958) \n\n\u00c1guila-Hernandez \n(1987) \n\nJasper et al. \n(1955) \n\n% AADb \n\n318.15 26.72c       \n323.15 27.42     27.15  \n333.15 26.60     26.25  \n\nn-C22H46 \n\n343.15 25.79     25.54  \n\n1.1 \n\n          \n323.15 26.67c       \n333.15 27.05       n-C24H50 \n343.15 26.22       \n\n \n\na  maximum uncertainty: \u00b1 0.03 mN\u00b7m-1 \n\nb  Eq.

Average absolute \n\ndeviations (Eq. I.7) for the pure components are 0.7 % and 0.9%, respectively for n-\n\nhexadecane and n-eicosane. For the other mixtures, no data was previously available. \n\nThe curvature presented as a function of composition, where the mixture surface \n\ntension is higher than the corresponding mole fraction average, is typical of n-alkane \n\nmixtures. The opposite trend is commonly observed in mixtures containing other families \n\nof fluids. These differences are the consequence of the different surface compositions that \n\nwill result in the minimum free energy of the system. \n\n22.0\n\n24.0\n\n26.0\n\n28.0\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nx  (2)\n\n?? ??\n/m\n\nN\n.m\n\n-1\n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 22 - \n\nThe ternary mixtures n-C7H16 (or n-C10H22) + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50 were studied at \n\nequimolar compositions of n-C20H42 and n-C24H50 to allow for a comparison of this ternary \n\ndata with those of the binaries n-C7H16 (or n-C10H22) + n-C22H46. These systems are plotted \n\non Figures I.6-I.7 as a function of n-heptane and n-decane mole fractions, respectively. As \n\ncan be seen from this figures and Tables I.2 and I.3, it seems that the binary data resembles \n\nthat of the equivalent ternary. It is interesting to note that the equimolar (x = 0.5) mixture \n\nof n-eicosane and n-tetracosane presents surface tension values quite close to those of pure \n\nn-docosane, although systematically lower. A study on several other pure, binary and \n\nternary data from different sources (Jasper et al.,1953; McLure et al. 1982; Jasper, 1972; \n\nKoefoed et al. 1958; \u00c1guila-Hernandez, 1987; Jasper et al., 1955; Grigoryev et al., 1992; \n\nPandey et al., 1982; Pugachevich et al. 1980) showed that for n-alkanes with the same \n\naverage chain length, surface tension slightly decreases with the increase on the number of \n\ncomponents, as observed in this work. \n\nFigure I. 6: Surface tension of  n-C7H16 + n-C22H46 (filled symbols) and  \nn-C7H16  + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50 (open symbols).

This apparatus is based on the measurement of the time that a \n\nsteel ball needs to roll down inside a glass capillary filled with sample, Figure I. 9. \n\nFigure I. 9: AMV 200 Anton Paar automated microviscometer. Right: detail of the working \nprinciple (Dandekar et. al., 1998) \n\n \n\nSeveral combinations of ball(A)/capillary(C) of different diameters can be selected, \n\ngiving the possibility of measuring viscosities from 0.5 to 800 mPa\u00b7s. One of the \n\nadvantages of this technique is that it requires very small amounts of sample (B). \n\nDepending on the capillary, only 0.12 to 2.5 cm3 are used. For the measurements reported \n\nin this section, a glass capillary of 1.6 mm diameter and gold balls of 1.500 mm diameter \n\nwere used. The measurement is fully automatic. Two magnetic sensors (F) are used to \n\ndetermine the rolling time which is reported within \u00b1 0.01 s. Shear stress can be varied by \n\nselecting different rolling angles, and up to ten different rolling angles (both positive and \n\nnegative) can be chosen from 15\u00ba to 90\u00ba. Up to six repetitions can be programmed for each \n\nangle. \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 28 - \n\nThe viscosity is calculated from the rolling times and the liquid density using the \n\nfollowing equation: \n\n \n\n( )liquidballt ????? ?= )(         (I. 8) \n\n \n\nwhere ? is the viscosity, mPa\u00b7s, ? is a calibration constant which only depends on the \n\nangle ?, t is the roll time, s, and ? is the density, Kg\u00b7m-3. Density values to be used with \n\nEq. I.8 are reported in section I.2.3. \n\nThe parameter ? is only angle-dependent and has to be determined, for each angle ?, \n\nwith liquids of known viscosity and density. Distilled water, Cannon Instruments Co. and \n\nHAAKE Medingen Gmbh viscosity standards were used for calibration. These standards \n\nwere selected so that the entire measuring range was covered. \n\nTemperature was controlled in the viscometer by the use of a Heto thermostatic \n\ncirculator. A built-in temperature sensor (I), placed closed to the capillary surface, \n\nenclosed in a thermostatic capillary block (E) on whose walls the thermostatic water \n\ncirculates (D), measured the temperature. The temperature working range for this \n\ninstrument is 279.15 to 353.15 K with an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.01 K. \n\nThe following chemicals were used in the measurements: n-heptane  \n\n(Rathburn, ?  99 wt. %), n-decane (Aldrich, ? 99 wt. %), n-hexadecane  \n\n(Aldrich, ?  99 wt. %), n-eicosane (Aldrich, ?  99 wt. %), n-docosane  \n\n(Fluka, ?  98 wt. %) and n-tetracosane (Fluka, ?  99 wt %). Liquid room-temperature n-\n\nalkanes (n-heptane and n-decane) were dried over molecular sieves. No further purification \n\nwas carried out. \n\nMixtures (total mass of 10 g) were carefully prepared by weighing the components on \n\na Sartorius analytical balance (\u00b1 0.0001 g). After preparation, solutions were kept in the \n\nrefrigerator between measurements. \n\nFollowing the measurements, the viscometer capillary was carefully cleaned with \n\ntoluene and ethanol and afterwards dried with vacuum. \n\n\n\nExperimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n- 29 - \n\nViscosity was measured, at atmospheric pressure, from 293.15 K (or above the \n\nmelting point) up to 343.15 K in temperature intervals of 10 K. A new ball was used for \n\neach measurement. \n\nThe measured viscosities are reported in Tables I.6 \u2013 I.9. Each viscosity measurement \n\nwas performed at 10 different rolling angles from 15.0\u00ba to 46.5\u00ba with four repetitions at \n\neach value. Each reported data point is thus an average of 40 different viscosity \n\nmeasurements. \n\nIt should be noted that, for n-heptane, viscosity is only reported up to 323.2 K, since at \n\nthe highest temperatures, considerable deviations were found against literature data. These \n\nmeasurements would also correspond to a measuring range substantially below the lower \n\nlimit suggested by the viscometer manufacturer. \n\nFigure I. 10: Viscosity of n-C16H34: ?  this work, ?

For the other \n\nn-alkanes deviations were the following: n-heptane, 1.7 %, n-decane, 3.2 %, n-hexadecane, \n\n1.6 %, n-eicosane, 2.0 %, with the average of all deviations being 2.1 %, quite close to the \n\nvalues found by Dandekar et al.

Characterization of the Distillation Cuts \n\n \n\nThis section deals with the characterization of five distillation cuts  \n\n(503 K-648 K) from crudes of different sources (North Sea, Africa and Middle East) \n\nobtained from the Petrogal refinery. They were chosen because they are the basis for the \n\ndiesels produced at the refinery and cover the range of n-alkane contents typically found \n\nthere (3 to 30 wt. %). Precipitation curves for these cuts, showing the temperature \n\ndependence of the solid fraction, were measured by Differential Scanning Calorimetry \n\n(DSC) according to a method proposed before (Coutinho et al., 1997 and 2000b). n-alkane \n\ncompositions were kindly determined at the Universit\u00e9 de Pau et de Pays de L\u2019Adour, \n\nFrance, by gas chromatography (GC), and the average molecular weight was estimated by \n\nfreezing point depression. No attempt to obtain any further compositional information was \n\ndone since, as will be discussed later (section III.5), the non n-alkane compounds do not \n\nplay a relevant role in the low temperature behavior of these fluids. \n\nTo measure the composition of the samples a Hewlett Packard 6890 chromatograph \n\nequipped with a hydrogen flame ionization detector was used. The column employed is \n\ncomposed by a pre-column of 1 m (ID = 530 \u00b5m); two 30 m columns, the first an HP 5 MS \n\n(ID = 320 \u00b5m and film thickness 0.5 \u00b5m) and the second a HP 5 (ID = 320 \u00b5m and film \n\nthickness 0.25 \u00b5m), and a final empty column of about 30 cm. The injection is performed \n\non-column. On this chromatograph both the temperature and the carrier gas flow rate are \n\nprogrammable. To obtain a better separation of the heavy n-alkanes, the gas flow rate is \n\nkept at 2 cm3/min during the first 100 minutes and then increased to 3 cm3/min. The \n\nheating starts at 333 K, goes at 2.5 K/min up to 578 K, and then at 2 K/min up to 593 K. \n\nUnder these conditions n-alkanes between n-decane (n-C10H22) and n-triacontane  \n\n(n-C30H62) can be quantified. n-nonane (n-C9H20) (Aldrich, >99 %) was used as reference \n\nand CS2 as solvent. A chromatogram for Oso condensate is shown in Figure I. 17. The \n\ncompositions obtained are presented in Table I. 14. \n\n\n\nExperimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n- 47 - \n\nFigure I. 17:  Gas chromatography analysis of the distillation cut obtained from Oso condensate. \nThe higher peaks are the n-alkanes. \n\n \n\nCalorimetric measurements were performed on a Setaram DSC 141 differential \n\nscanning calorimeter. The sample was initially cooled to 130 K, kept at that temperature \n\nfor 15 minutes to stabilize, and then heated up to 593 K at 3 K/min. This heating rate was \n\nchosen since it provides a good compromise between a good signal and to be close to \n\nequilibrium conditions. The wax appearance temperatures presented in Table I. 15 were \n\nmeasured under these conditions and may thus be slightly over estimated. The \n\nthermograms are presented in Figure I. 18. They are similar to other DSC measurements \n\nfor fuels and crudes previously reported in the literature (Coutinho et al., 2000b; L\u00e9toff\u00e9 et \n\nal., 1995; Bosselet et al., 1983). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 48 - \n\nTable I. 14: n-alkane composition (wt %) and average molecular weight (g/mol) of the distillation cuts studied \n\nDistillation cut C10H22 C11H24 C12H26 C13H26 C14H30 C15H32 C16H34 C17H36 C18H40 C19H40 C20H42 C21H44 C22H46 C23H48 C24H50 Total MW \n\nBrent 0.04 0.06 0.36 10.65 13.42 14.43 11.86 9.72 8.3 7.97 8.25 6.97 6.52 1.42  19.6 222.8 \nOso 0.05 0.11 0.56 10.11 12.77 13.61 11.15 9.88 9.01 8.94 8.46 8.04 6.02 1.22 0.04 32.0 226.8 \nTroll 0.07 0.09 0.28 9.65 14.05 16.36 12.15 9.40 8.63 8.09 8.03 6.32 5.53 1.36  9.79 231.7 \nDUC   0.07 5.50 13.66 17.30 9.97 7.22 9.52 9.81 11.42 6.19 7.21 2.14  2.79 220.3 \nSahara Blend 0.03 0.09 0.53 13.22 14.79 14.94 11.39 10.41 9.07 7.78 7.38 5.54 4.06 0.75 0.02 21.2 235.8 \n\nAverage \ndistribution \n\n0.05 0.09 0.36 9.83 13.74 15.33 11.30 9.33 8.91 8.52 8.71 6.61 5.87 1.38 0.03   \n\n \n\nTable I. 15: measured wax appearance temperatures (WAT) \n\nDistillation cut Measured WAT/K \n\nBrent 273.8 \nOso Condensate 278.9 \nTroll 265.6 \nDUC 256.2 \nSahara Blend 271.2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nExperimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n- 49 - \n\nAfter a glass transition at around 190 K, there was an exothermic peak due to the \n\ncrystallization of species that did not crystallize on cooling. This was followed by a broad \n\nendotherm due to the dissolution of the paraffinic crystals in the liquid matrix. The major \n\nproblem in the treatment of DSC results from these fluids is the definition of a base line. \n\nAs proposed by Bosselet et al. (1983) and L\u00e9toff\u00e9 et al. (1995) a polynomial line fitted to \n\nthe liquid region and the basis of the exotherm, where the dissolution of the paraffins \n\nbegan, is used as base line. Since there is no way to assess the \u2018true\u2019 base line for these \n\nfluids this is a fair approach to it. Nevertheless, one must be aware that some uncertainty \n\nwas introduced in the calculations by its adoption. Using this base line the fraction of \n\nsolids dissolved is obtained using an approach proposed before were the fraction of melted \n\nn-alkanes was identified with the fraction of total energy required to completely melt the n-\n\nalkanes obtained from the integration of the energy using the adjusted base line  \n\n(Coutinho et al., 1997 and 2000b). \n\nFigure I. 18:  DSC measurements for distillation cuts from (a), Brent; (b), Oso Condensate;  \n(c), Troll; (d), DUC; (e) Sahara Blend. \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 50 - \n\nFigure I.18: (Continued). \n\n\n\nExperimental Methods, Results and Discussion \n\n- 51 - \n\nFigure I.18: (Continued). \n\n \n\nResults from these calculations will be presented and compared with model results in \n\nsection III.5. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n- 53 - \n\nI.3. Conclusions \n\n \n\nSeveral experimental measurements were reported on vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid \n\ninterfacial tensions, liquid densities and viscosities. Differential scanning calorimetry and \n\ngas chromatography were also used to characterize some petroleum distillation cuts which \n\nwere selected to represent real hydrocarbon fluids containing heavier n-alkanes. \n\nPure component data was used to evaluate the performance of the equipment. Special \n\ncare was given to tensiometry, since the NIMA DST 9005 tensiometer was used for the first \n\ntime during these measurements. For that, additional binary mixtures were considered in \n\norder to better check its accuracy. As shown during this chapter, vapor-liquid interfacial \n\ntension agreed with literature within 1.2 %, water-n-alkane interfacial tension within  \n\n0.3 %, viscosity within 2.1 % and liquid density within 0.1 %. It can thus be concluded that \n\nthe measurements were accurate, giving also some confidence about the results for new \n\nsystems. \n\nMixtures were selected in order to extend the available literature database. Particularly \n\nfor those containing heavier n-alkanes and small chain length homologues (asymmetric \n\nmixtures) data were scarce. Seven binary and two ternary mixtures were thus selected for \n\nthis purpose. Binary results were presented in the full composition range and at a set of \n\ntemperatures starting from 293.15 K and ending at 343.13 K, the upper working limit of he \n\nemployed densimeter. \n\nThe measured properties from the ternary mixtures, n-C7H16 (or n-C10H22) + n-C20H42 \n\n+ n-C24H50, were compared with those from the equivalent binaries, n-C7H16 or (n-C10H22) \n\n+ n-C22H46 using equimolar n-C20H42 and n-C24H50 in the preparation of the ternary \n\nmixtures. Results confirmed that although the corresponding liquid densities can be \n\nconsidered equal, viscosities and interfacial tensions of the ternaries tend to be lower than \n\nthose from the binaries. \n\nSurface freezing, a phenomenon that has been found to occur in some heavier n-\n\nalkanes and n-alcohols and that can be followed from tensiometry (Wu et al., 1993) was \n\nobserved from the interfacial tension measurements. Thus, from this work it can be \n\n\n\nPart I: Experimental \n\n- 54 - \n\nconcluded that the employed Nima tensiometer may also be used to investigate this phase \n\ntransition. \n\nFrom the measurements reported in this chapter a considerable amount of data is now \n\navailable for asymmetric and heavier n-alkane mixtures.

Introduction \n\n \n\nIn this chapter a review of the available experimental critical properties and Pitzer \n\nacentric factors for n-alkanes, as well as an assessment of correlations for their estimation \n\nwill be presented and discussed, since these are especially important for modeling \n\npurposes, particularly for corresponding states models, as will be later shown during  \n\nPart III. \n\nIn section II.3 interfacial tension and viscosity data are used to evaluate a linear \n\nrelation between the natural logarithm of the vapor-liquid interfacial tension and the \n\nreciprocal viscosity, first proposed by Pelofsky (1966). The interest in these relations \n\nfollows from the possibility of obtaining one of these properties from measurements on the \n\nother, thus overcoming data deficiency. These relations can also be used to test the validity \n\nof measured data, since deviations can be ascribed to experimental errors. \n\nIt will be shown that this relation holds for both pure and mixed n-alkanes. Since most \n\nof the available data is from the lowest members of the series and following the purposes \n\nof this thesis, results will be mostly focused on the heavier members and some of their \n\nmixtures with lighter components (asymmetric mixtures).

Critical Properties and Acentric Factors \n\n \n\nProperties such as critical temperatures, critical pressures, critical volumes and Pitzer \n\nacentric factors are frequently required as input data for many models. For example, \n\ncorresponding states models and equations of state rely on these pure component properties \n\nfor their accurate modeling results. In this section, an overview of the available \n\nexperimental data for n-alkanes and an evaluation of some correlations for their prediction \n\nare presented. \n\nA good selection of correlations is particularly important for the heavier n-alkanes for \n\nwhich no experimental information is available. \n\n\n\nPart II: Data Correlation \n\n- 60 - \n\nSeveral works on literature reported critical properties for the n-alkane series  \n\n(Ambrose et al., 1995; Anselme, 1990; Magoulas et al., 1990; Nikitin et al., 1997;  \n\nTeja et al., 1990; Tsonopoulos, 1987). Ambrose et al. (1995) performed a literature review \n\nand presented values for all the n-alkanes ranging from methane up to n-tetracosane  \n\n(n-C24H50). Above n-tetracosane, Nikitin et al. (1997) reported values for n-C26H54, n-\n\nC28H58, n-C30H62 and n-C36H74. \n\nThese values, reported by Ambrose (1995) and Nikitin et al. (1997), are presented in \n\nTable II. 1 and were used to assess the available correlations for the estimation of long \n\nchain n-alkanes. \n\nFor the acentric factors, Magoulas et al. (1990) presented values from methane up to \n\nn-eicosane. These are also reported in Table II. 1. \n\nTable II. 1: n-alkane selected experimental critical properties and acentric factors \n\nn-alkane Tc/K Pc/MPa Vc/cm\n3.mol-1 ????    \n\nCH4 190.564 4.599 98.60 0.011 \nC2H6 305.32 4.872 145.5 0.099 \nn-C3H8 369.83 4.248 200 0.152 \nn-C4H10 425.12 3.796 255 0.199 \nn-C5H12 469.7 3.370 311 0.251 \nn-C6H14 507.6 3.025 368 0.299 \nn-C7H16 540.2 2.74 428 0.350 \nn-C8H18 568.7 2.49 492 0.397 \nn-C9H20 594.6 2.29 555 0.443 \nn-C10H22 617.7 2.11 624 0.490 \nn-C11H24 639 1.98 689 0.533 \nn-C12H26 658 1.82 754 0.573 \nn-C13H28 675 1.68 823 0.618 \nn-C14H30 693 1.57 894 0.654 \nn-C15H32 708 1.48 966 0.696 \nn-C16H34 723 1.40 1034 0.737 \nn-C17H36 736 1.34 1103 0.772 \nn-C18H38 747 1.29 1189 0.812 \nn-C19H40 755 1.16  0.844 \nn-C20H42 768 1.07  0.891 \nn-C21H44 778 1.03   \nn-C22H46 786 0.98   \nn-C23H48 790 0.92   \nn-C24H50 800 0.87   \nn-C26H54 816 0.795   \nn-C28H58 824 0.744   \nn-C30H62 843 0.636   \nn-C36H74 872 0.475   \n\n \n\n\n\nCritical Properties and Acentric Factors \n\n- 61 - \n\nCritical temperature \n\nTo estimate the critical temperatures of heavier n-alkanes, correlations were collected \n\nfrom different sources (Ambrose, 1978 and 1979; Constantinou et al., 1994;  \n\nHu et al., 1993; Joback et al., 1987; Kontogeorgis et al., 1997; Lydersen, 1955;  \n\nMarano et al., 1997a and 1997b; Marrero-Morej\u00f3n et al., 1999; Nakanishi et al., 1960; \n\nNikitin et al., 1997; Robinson, 1987; Teja et al., 1990 and Tsonopoulos, 1987). \n\nFrom all the selected correlations, that from Tsonopoulos (1987), to be used above  \n\nn-C3H8, was found to be the best for describing the experimental critical temperatures  \n\n(up to n-C36H74), although it was derived when only data up to n-C18H38 was available: \n\n \n\n( ) 3/2c n211145.081536.6T98.959ln \u00d7?=?

Interfacial Tension - Viscosity Relations \n\n \n\nFollowing several attempts to relate vapor-liquid interfacial tension with viscosity, \n\nPelofsky (1966) presented a linear relation between these two thermophysical properties: \n\n \n\n?\n?\n\nB\nA += lnln          (II. 6) \n\n \n\n\n\nPart II: Data Correlation \n\n- 68 - \n\nwhere A and B are constants, ? is the interfacial tension, and ? the viscosity. \n\nAccording to Pelofsky (1966), this empirical relation can be applied for both organic and \n\ninorganic liquid phases of pure and mixed components. Several fluids were shown to \n\nfollow these relations: n-alkanes in the range n-C2H6 - n-C6H14, benzene, toluene, xylenes, \n\nphenol and other aromatics, n-alcohols in the range CH3OH \u2013 n-C4H9OH, ketones, water \n\nand some aqueous solutions. \n\nLatter, Schonhorn (1967) introduced a correction in the second term of the right-hand \n\nside of Eq. II.6 to fulfill the requirement that at the critical point interfacial goes to zero, \n\nwhile viscosity tends to a small, but constant value: \n\n \n\nvl\n\nB\nA\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n+= lnln         (II. 7) \n\n \n\nwhere subscripts l and v stand for the liquid and vapor phase, respectively. This \n\nrelation was successfully applied by Schonhorn (1967) for pure metals like sodium and \n\npotassium, salts such as KBr, NaBr and NaCl, n-decane, argon, benzene, water, CCl4 and \n\npolyethylene. \n\nIn his work, Schonhorn (1967) related ln A with ?N, the interfacial tension at TN, the \n\ntemperature of homogeneous nucleation, that is, the temperature were clusters start to form \n\nspontaneously. At this temperature, the reciprocal viscosity tends to zero and thus, ? = A. \n\nBoth in the works from Pelofsky (1966) and Shonhorn (1967) no physical meaning has \n\nbeen given to the slope, B, although Pelofsky has used a functional of the molecular weight \n\nto correlate this constant for members of the same family. \n\nFollowing the work from Pelofsky (1966), later re-evaluated by Schonhorn (1967) and \n\nPedersen et al. (1989), several pure and mixed n-alkanes were assessed. Since most of the \n\navailable data has been taken far from the critical point, where the vapor phase viscosity is \n\nsmall compared to that of the liquid phase, we can drop the correction introduced in  \n\nEq. II.7 and use Pelofsky\u2019s approach (Eq. II.6). With this approach, although an incorrect \n\ndescription of the interfacial tension is obtained close to the critical point, no need for \n\ninformation on the vapor phase viscosity is required, and the formalism of Eq. II.6 can be \n\n\n\nSurface Tension-Viscosity Relations \n\n- 69 - \n\nkept very simple and accurate, far from the critical point, while using a minimum amount \n\nof experimental data. \n\n \n\nPure components \n\nThe data reported in Part I together with other pure component data  \n\n(DIPPR, 1998; Vargaftik, 1975) was used for the purposes of this section. Since the \n\nliterature information for interfacial tension is considerably smaller than that available for \n\nviscosity, interfacial tension limited the temperature range of this study. For the same \n\nreason, no pressure effect was considered at this point. \n\nIn Figure II. 5, the linear relation (Eq. II.6) is verified for some of the studied  \n\nn-alkanes: n-C6H14 up to n-C20H42. The same trend below n-hexane was also verified in \n\nthis work and has already been shown by Pelofsky (1966). In these plots, only two points \n\nin 163 happened to be outside the linear relation, but these were also found to be outliers in \n\nthe interfacial tension or viscosity plots as a function of temperature. Thus, if a set of \n\nvalues is found to be away from the linear plot, that may indicate incorrect viscosity or \n\ninterfacial tension measurements. \n\nFigure II. 5:  Plots of ln ???? as a function of reciprocal viscosity, 1/???? for several pure n-alkanes: ? , \nn-C6H14, ? , n-C7H16, ?  n-C8H18, x, n-C9H20, ? , n-C10H22, ? , n-C11H24, +, n-C12H26, ? , \nn-C13H28, -, n-C15H32, x, n-C16H34, *, n-C18H38, ? , n-C20H42. \n\n2.4\n\n2.6\n\n2.8\n\n3.0\n\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\n0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0\n1/????\n\nln\n ?? ??\n\n\n\nPart II: Data Correlation \n\n- 70 - \n\nTable II. 2: Least squares fit for n-alkanes, and corresponding ????N and TN values. \n\nn-alkane B ln A ????N/mN.m\n-1         calc. ? ? ? ?????/?/?/?/?    ? ? ? ? range/????    \n\nCH4 -0.0922 3.35   93.15 - 163.15 \nC2H6 -0.138 3.60   133.15-193.15 \nn-C3H8 -0.162 3.55   203.15-263.15 \nn-C4H10 -0.174 3.54 34.5 124.8 233.15-293.15 \nn-C5H12 -0.166 3.52 33.8 148.3 233.15-293.15 \nn-C6H14 -0.180 3.49 32.8 164.0 273.15-333.15 \nn-C7H16 -0.194 3.48 32.3 181.0 273.15-363.15 \nn-C8H18 -0.204 3.46 31.7 198.5 243.15-393.15 \nn-C9H20 -0.215 3.43 31.0 213.5 273.15-393.15 \nn-C10H22 -0.222 3.41 30.4 227.3 273.15-393.15 \nn-C11H24 -0.241 3.41 30.3 234.5 273.15-393.15 \nn-C12H26 -0.256 3.41 30.1 242.8 273.15-393.15 \nn-C13H28 -0.279 3.41 30.2 247.1 273.15-393.15 \nn-C14H30 -0.297 3.41 30.1 255.0 283.15-393.15 \nn-C15H32 -0.312 3.40 30.0 262.0 293.15-393.15 \nn-C16H34 -0.341 3.41 30.2 266.1 293.15-393.15 \nn-C17H36 -0.363 3.41 30.2 270.1 293.15-393.15 \nn-C18H38 -0.380 3.41 30.1 274.1 303.15-393.15 \nn-C19H40 -0.388 3.39 29.8 280.1 313.15-393.15 \nn-C20H42 -0.447 3.41 30.3 278.8 313.15-393.15 \n\n \n\nAs can be seen from Figure II. 5 and Table II. 2, ln A tends to a value close to 3.41 as \n\nthe chain length of the n-alkane increases.

Conclusions \n\n \n\nA review on the available n-alkane experimental critical properties and Pitzer acentric \n\nfactors was presented.

Several correlations were assessed and the Tsonopoulos (1987), \n\nMagoulas et al. (1990), Marano et al. (1997a) and the Han et al. (1993) correlations were \n\nfound to be the most accurate at describing, respectively, critical temperatures, critical \n\npressures, critical volumes and acentric factors. \n\nA linear relation between the natural logarithm of the vapor-liquid interfacial tension \n\nand the reciprocal viscosity was found to be valid for pure n-alkanes, some of their binary \n\nand ternary mixtures and petroleum distillation cuts of different n-alkane content. \n\nThe intercept can be linked with the interfacial tension at the temperature of \n\nhomogeneous nucleation, where the reciprocal viscosity approaches zero. For n-alkanes \n\nwith chain length higher than n-C10H22 this value is constant. Below n-C10H22, a linear \n\ncorrelation can be used for its calculation. \n\nFor the slope, two correlations where proposed: one for fluids with chain length higher \n\nthan n-C10H22, and other for fluids with chain length smaller than n-C10H22. Methane is not \n\nincluded in any of the proposed correlations, since its behavior falls outside that observed \n\nfor the other n-alkanes. \n\nSome heavier and asymmetric n-alkane mixtures reported in the previous chapter of \n\nthis thesis were evaluated for the extension of the proposed linear relation to mixtures. \n\nLinearity was again observed, and interestingly, intercepts equal to those of the same chain \n\nlength pure components were found. The same happened with the slopes that could be \n\ncalculated from an equation obtained for the pure components. Using the equivalent pure \n\ncomponent slopes and intercepts, very good interfacial tension estimates where obtained \n\nfrom viscosity data. If viscosity is to be obtained from interfacial tension larger errors shall \n\nbe expected. \n\n\n\nPart II: Data Correlation \n\n- 80 - \n\nFinally, some petroleum distillation cuts of different origins where also shown to \n\nfollow the presented linear relation, but, as expected, the correlating equations presented \n\nbefore where not applicable, since these contain components other than n-alkanes.

Introduction \n\n \n\nAccurate values of thermophysical properties are essential for the correct process and \n\nproduct design. Frequently, the desired properties at the required temperature, pressure and \n\ncomposition conditions may not yet have been determined experimentally, and so, either \n\nan experimental determination must be carried out or an adequate model should be \n\nselected. \n\nRegularly, models are used, as experimental measurements are expensive and time \n\nconsuming, and the desired accuracies for the required properties may not be very \n\nrestrictive. \n\nThere is a considerable number of models for the estimation of each thermophysical \n\nproperty (Poling et al., 2000). These models can be classified as theoretical, empirical or \n\nsemi-empirical. The first are usually the more general and can be applied for new systems, \n\nbut they often present large deviations and can only be used for qualitative purposes. \n\nEmpirical models can be highly accurate, since some of its parameters are regressed from \n\nexperimental data, but these are less theoretically sound and extrapolations for new \n\nsystems and regions outside the fitted area must be done with caution. Semi-empirical \n\nmodels are usually the best solution, since they combine a theoretical formalism with some \n\nparameter estimation from available experimental data. In any case, it is very important to \n\nevaluate a model against a small set of experimental data for similar systems, before we \n\nselect that model for our particular purposes. In this chapter, with the new data from \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 84 - \n\nsection I.2, model evaluation will be carried out in order to check their application for the \n\nnew heavier and asymmetric n-alkane mixtures. \n\nNo attempt to extensively evaluate literature models for the systems presented on this \n\nthesis was made, as some general reviews can be found on literature (Poling et al., 2000) \n\nand this would, most certainly, lead to the selection of different models for each \n\nthermophysical property. Instead, the focus was on the selection of generalized models that \n\ncould be simultaneously used for more than one property such as corresponding states and \n\nequations of state based models such as the friction theory for viscosity and liquid density \n\nand the gradient theory of fluid interfaces than can be used to simultaneously model phase \n\nequilibrium, interfacial tensions and density profiles. \n\nSome of the most accurate models, although mathematically simple and using a small \n\namount of experimental information, are those based on the corresponding states principle. \n\nOne of the advantages of corresponding states models is that the same formalism can be \n\nused for different properties, where the only changes are the definition of the reduced \n\nproperty and the equation used for the reference system or the reference system itself. \n\nSince these models do not use any experimental data of the estimating property of the \n\ntarget fluid, they are also predictive. The only experimental information required from the \n\ntarget fluid are the critical properties and the Pitzer acentric factor. The coupling between \n\nthe strong theoretical basis behind the corresponding states principle and the accuracy of \n\nthe empirical equations used to describe the reference system justify the effort in \n\ndeveloping such models. \n\nCorresponding states models have been successfully used for the estimation of \n\nproperties of pure components and mixtures, mainly for nonpolar and small molecules, \n\nalthough some effort has also been made at extending them to polar fluids and their \n\nmixtures (Marrucho, 1996; Marrucho et al., 1998). This chapter presents the extension of \n\nthese models for the evaluation of thermophysical properties of long chain molecules in a \n\nbroad temperature range, based on information from lower members of the same \n\nhomologous series. A new model is presented and evaluated for the prediction of the liquid \n\ndensities, viscosities and vapor-liquid interfacial tensions presented in Part I. It will also be \n\nshown that this model may improve the estimation of other properties such as vapor \n\npressures, thermal conductivities and speeds of sound. Using the same framework, this \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n- 85 - \n\nmodel can be used to predict all these properties in a broad temperature range and for both \n\nlighter and heavier n-alkanes and their mixtures. \n\nThe gradient theory of fluid interfaces and the friction theory are state-of-the-art \n\nmodels, with the most interesting developments reported in the last five years  \n\n(Cornelisse et al., 1996; Cornelisse, 1997; Kahl et al., 2000 and 2002; Miqueu, 2001; \n\nMiqueu et al., 2003 and 2004; Quin\u00f5nes-Cisneros et al., 2000, 2001a and 2001b;  \n\nZ\u00e9berg-Mikkelsen et al., 2001 and 2002; Zuo et al., 1996, 1997b and 1998). Some results \n\nfrom these models will be presented and discussed during sections III.3 and II.4, \n\nrespectively. \n\nAiming at describe the water-hydrocarbon liquid-liquid interfaces, the gradient theory \n\nwas coupled with the Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state, a thermodynamic \n\nmodel that has shown to be able to describe vapor-liquid and liquid-liquid equilibria of \n\nmixtures containing water, alkanes and alcohols (Derawi, 2002; Kontogeorgis et al., 1996 \n\nand 1999; Voutsas, 2000; Wu et al., 1998; Yakoumis et al., 1998). Particularly for  \n\nwater-alkane systems, CPA is actually the only model that provides acceptable results for \n\nboth the solubility of water in the hydrocarbon-phase and the hydrocarbon solubility in the \n\naqueous phase, thus presenting a great potential for the correct modeling of water-\n\nhydrocarbon liquid-liquid interfaces. \n\nFinally, during section III.5 solid-liquid equilibria will be considered, as heavier  \n\nn-alkanes are solid at ambient conditions. Accurate modeling of this kind of mixtures has \n\nalready been reported (Coutinho, 1995 and 1998; Coutinho et al., 1995 and 1996), so in \n\nthis chapter, data from the petroleum distillation cuts presented in chapter I will be used for \n\nchecking model performance for real systems. The measured precipitation curves are \n\ncompared with the predictions using the compositional analysis presented before. The \n\nselected model, which only requires the n-alkane composition, agrees well with the \n\nexperimental data indicating that it can be an adequate tool to predict the low temperature \n\nbehavior of hydrocarbon mixtures. No need for other mixture information, as usually \n\nrequired with other models is necessary. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Corresponding States Principle \n\n- 87 - \n\n \n\n\"As three laws were good enough for Newton, I have modestly \n\ndecided to stop there\" \n\n????'??&amp;??&amp;???/???\n?\n????????\t?????\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUsing the new measurements reported on Part I and other data collected from the \n\nliterature along with the critical properties and acentric factors selected on Part II, the \n\nCorresponding States Principle was assessed for the modeling of some thermophysical \n\nproperties of pure and mixed n-alkanes. \n\nA new corresponding states model is proposed. When using a generalized combining \n\nrule for the critical temperature, mixture data can be described with deviations within the \n\nexperimental uncertainty of the measurements. \n\n \n\nIII.2. The Corresponding States Principle \n\n \n\nIII.2.1. Pure Fluids \n\n \n\nThe application of corresponding states models extends from equilibrium properties \n\nsuch as vapor pressure (Morgan et al., 1994; Pitzer et al., 1955; Poling et al., 2000;  \n\nTeja et al., 1981b; Xiang, 2002), liquid density (Mu\u00f1oz et al., 1983; Poling et al., 2000; \n\nTeja et al., 1981b; Teja, 1980) or surface tension (Poling et al., 2000; Queimada et al., \n\n2001b; Rice et al., 1982; Zuo et al., 1997a) to transport properties such as viscosity  \n\n(Ely et al., 1981; Klein et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1993; Poling et al., 2000;  \n\nTeja et al., 1981a) and thermal conductivity (Poling et al., 2000). In spite of this versatility, \n\nthe small amount of experimental information required and its mathematical simplicity, \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 88 - \n\ncorresponding states models can produce very accurate estimates of thermophysical \n\nproperties, in broad temperature and pressure conditions. If we still add the strong \n\ntheoretical basis behind the corresponding states principle we can justify any effort in \n\nstudying and developing such models. \n\nThe corresponding states principle was initially proposed by van der Walls who \n\nobserved that the reduced version of his equation of state could be written for several \n\nfluids. Although the establishment of this principle was originally made only on an \n\nempirical basis, following studies in statistical mechanics and kinetic theory have \n\nconfirmed its theoretical foundations (Ely et al., 2000; Guggenheim, 1945; Leland et al., \n\n1968; Pitzer, 1939; Reed et al.,1973; Rowlinson et al., 1982). Today, many generalized \n\nequations of state are examples of applications of this principle. \n\nThe basic concept of corresponding states principle is to apply dimensional analysis to \n\nthe configurational portion of the statistical mechanical partition function. The end result \n\nof this analysis is the expression of residual thermodynamic properties in terms of \n\ndimensionless groups. \n\nIn its original form, the corresponding states principle, as proposed by van der Waals, \n\nexpressed the reduced compressibility factor (Zr) in terms of a universal function of two \n\nparameters, the dimensionless temperature (Tr) and molar volume (Vr) (or pressure, pr): \n\n \n\n( ) ( )rrrrrjr VTZVTZ ,, 0=         (III. 1) \n\nc\nr\n\nT\n\nT\nT = ,  \n\nc\nr\n\nV\n\nV\nV = , \n\nc\nr\n\np\n\np\np =       (III. 2) \n\n \n\nWhere Z is the compressibility factor, pV/RT, and the subscripts r and c stand for \n\nreduced and critical property and j and 0 for target and spherical reference fluid, \n\nrespectively. \n\nExperimental evidence has, however, shown that this two-parameter corresponding \n\nstates approach was limited to the noble gases and nearly spherical molecules such as \n\nnitrogen, oxygen and methane. To extend this theory to a broader range of fluids, \n\n\n\nThe Corresponding States Principle \n\n- 89 - \n\nadditional characterization parameters have been introduced to account for the  \n\nnon-conformalities. Two main approaches have been applied in this parameterization: the \n\nfirst performs a multi-parameter Taylor\u2019s series expansion of the property of interest about \n\nthe parameters; the second approach is to extend the simple two-parameter corresponding \n\nstates principle at its molecular origin. This is accomplished by making the intermolecular \n\npotential parameters functions of the additional characterization parameters and the \n\nthermodynamic state, e.g. the temperature. The end result is a corresponding states model \n\nthat has the same mathematical form as the simple two-parameter model, but the \n\ndefinitions of the dimensionless volume and temperature are more complex, involving the \n\nso-called shape factors (Ely et al., 2000). These models have been referred as the  \n\nExtended Corresponding States Theory (ECST). \n\n \n\nTaylor series expansion \n\nAn additional third parameter, the Pitzer acentric factor, ?, was introduced  \n\n(Pitzer et al., 1955) to generalize the scope of the corresponding states principle including \n\nfluids whose force fields slightly depart from those of the original spherical symmetry. \n\nReduced pressure was used instead of reduced volume due to the uncertainty usually \n\nascribed to the measurement of critical volumes. A Taylor series expansion of the property \n\nof interest is performed about this third parameter, with the series being usually truncated \n\nbeyond the first derivative: \n\n \n\n( ) ( ) ( )rrrrr0rrrrj p,TZp,TZ,p,TZ ?+=?      (III. 3) \n\n \n\nwhere Zro has the same meaning as in Eq. III.1 and Zr is a function that represents the \n\ndeparture from the spherical symmetry, the derivative ??? /Z . In spite of the analytic \n\nformalism of Eq. III.3, values for the functions Zr0 and Zr were only presented in tabular \n\nform by Pitzer and co-workers. \n\nWith the advent of cheaper and faster computers, Lee et al. (1975) suggested replacing \n\nthe derivative in the Taylor series with its finite difference: \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 90 - \n\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )[ ]rr2rrr1r\n1\n\nj\nrr0rrrrj p,TZp,TZp,TZ,p,TZ ??\n\n?\n+=?    (III. 4) \n\n \n\nwith subscript 1 representing a non-spherical reference fluid (? > 0). \n\nAlthough this new formalism contained a correction for the departure from the \n\nspherical symmetry, some problems arose in the description of polar or asymmetric \n\nsystems. Since Eq. III.4 still contains a spherical reference fluid, (? = 0), large \n\ninterpolations/extrapolations were frequent in the description of real fluids. Another \n\nproblem was related with the widespread use of methane as the spherical reference fluid. \n\nSince methane has a triple point relatively high compared with the majority of the \n\nhydrocarbons, some low temperature calculations would result in the extrapolation of the \n\nmethane equation of state introducing considerable errors in the predicted data. \n\nFollowing Teja and coworkers (Pl\u00f6cker et al., 1978; Rice et al., 1982;  \n\nTeja et al., 1981a and 1981b; Teja, 1980; Wong et al., 1983; Zuo et al., 1997a) the \n\nspherical reference in Eq. III.4 was abandoned. Therefore, both reference fluids could be \n\nsimilar to the evaluating fluid, reducing the errors due to large \n\ninterpolations/extrapolations. Several thermophysical properties were estimated according \n\nto this new framework with very good predictive results: \n\n \n\n)( 12\n12\n\n1\n1 rrrr XXXX ??\n\n?\n+=\n\n??\n??\n\n      (III. 5) \n\n \n\nwhere Xr stands for the reduced property to be evaluated and subscripts 1 and 2 for the \n\ntwo reference fluid properties at the same reduced conditions as those of the target fluid. In \n\nall cases, good agreement with experimental data was obtained in the range of fluids \n\ncovered by the two references. However, considerable deviations can be found if the \n\nreference fluids are far apart in the series from the target fluid, either interpolating or \n\nextrapolating (Figures III.1-III.6). In an attempt to correct for these deviations, and based \n\non the dependence of the desired properties with ? (or chain length) presented on  \n\n\n\nThe Corresponding States Principle \n\n- 91 - \n\nFigures III.1 - III.6, the Taylor series expansion of the reduced property was carried out to \n\nthe second-order term: \n\n \n\n( ) ( ) ( )212111 ?????? ??+?+= DDXX rr      (III. 6) \n\n12\n1\n\n12\n\n?? ?\n?\n\n= rr\nXX\n\nD ,  \n23\n\n1213\n2\n\n1213\n\n??\n????\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n=\n\nrrrr XXXX\n\nD     (III. 7) \n\n \n\nA third reference fluid is introduced with the advantage that no change in the reference \n\nsystem has to be done if one wants to study a large range of fluids or an asymmetric \n\nmixture. If instead, the Teja approach (Eq. III.5) is adopted for asymmetric mixtures with a \n\nsingle reference system, considerable deviations resulting from the \n\ninterpolations/extrapolations may be found as will be latter shown. \n\nA quadratic dependence on the acentric factor for heavy alkanes (up to n-C28H58) was \n\npreviously used with success by Morgan et al. (1994) to correlate vapor pressures and \n\nheats of vaporization. \n\nThe linear Teja approach (Eq. III.5) and the new 2nd order perturbation model \n\n(Eq.III.6) were evaluated for saturated liquid density, liquid-vapor interfacial tension and \n\nviscosity of pure n-alkanes from methane up to n-hexatriacontane (n-C36H74), and some of \n\ntheir mixtures. Some results will also be presented for reduced vapor pressures, thermal \n\nconductivities and speeds of sound to show how this model can be used to improve the \n\nprediction of other thermophysical properties of the n-alkane series (Figures III.1 \u2013 III.6). \n\nSpecial care has been taken regarding the selection of the interfacial tension data since \n\nthe values very often differ considerably from author to author (Calado et al., 1978; \n\nGrigoryev et al., 1992; Hunten et al., 1929; Jasper, 1972; Jasper et al., 1953 and 1955; \n\nKatz et al., 1939; Leadbetter et al., 1964; Mass et al., 1921; McLure et al., 1982;  \n\nMiqueu et al., 2000; Wu, 1999). The data reported by Jasper (1972),  \n\nJasper et al. (1955, 1953) and by Grigoryev et al (1992) were used preferentially. The \n\nlatter article covers all the liquid region of n-alkanes between n-C5H12 and n-C8H18. \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 92 - \n\nEq.III.8 was used to correlate the experimental liquid-vapor interfacial tension of the \n\nreference fluids, thus yielding two parameters per each fluid: \n\n \n\n( )BrT1A ?\u00d7=?

Table III. 1 presents the studied \n\nn-alkanes for each property. \n\nIn order to compare the linear perturbation model (Eq.

Correlations were considered for those n-alkanes for which there were no \n\nexperimental information. Critical temperature was calculated from the correlation of \n\nTsonopoulos (1987), critical pressure from that of Magoulas et al. (1990), critical volume \n\nfrom Marano et al.

Measurements at higher temperatures are typically more \n\nuncertain, and properties such as vapor pressure and viscosity often present greater \n\nuncertainty at low temperatures due to the difficulties in measuring smaller vapor pressures \n\nand the sharp increase of viscosity with the proximity of the melting point. \n\nFigures III.7 \u2013 III.12 illustrate the percent average deviation of the estimated reduced \n\nproperties, with respect to the experimental value, as a function of the chain length of the \n\nn-alkane. It can be seen that the linear approach proposed by Teja and co-workers has \n\nsome limitations for the heavier n-alkanes and that the average deviation decreases \n\nconsiderably around the reference fluid, confirming that this model is not able to predict \n\nthe trend in the reduced property, as shown before on Figures III.1 \u2013 III.4. \n\n\n\nThe Corresponding States Principle \n\n- 101 - \n\nIn both models the highest deviations are found for the lowest and highest reduced \n\ntemperatures, except for viscosity where the highest deviations are mainly from the lowest \n\nreduced temperatures. As mentioned before, this should be the result of the higher \n\nuncertainties in the corresponding experimental measurements, coupled with the smaller \n\namount of data usually found in these regions that can make the correlating equations less \n\naccurate in these zones. \n\nThe 2nd order perturbation model shows a more random distribution of the deviations. \n\nSome higher values can be observed for liquid density and vapor pressure for the heavier \n\nmembers of the series, but still the deviations are smaller than those from the linear \n\napproach. \n\nFrom Figures III.1 \u2013 III.12 and Table III. 4 it can thus be concluded that if the \n\nevaluation of all the series of the n-alkanes using the linear perturbation model is required \n\nwe should use, at least, two sets of reference systems. Using the new 2nd order perturbation \n\njust one reference system is enough. \n\n \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 102 - \n\nFigure III. 7:  Average deviation of the reduced vapor pressure predicted with the linear \nperturbation model as a function of the chain length of the n-alkane. \n\nFigure III. 8:  Average deviation of the reduced vapor pressure predicted with the 2nd order \nperturbation model as a function of the chain length of the n-alkane. \n\n \n\n-10.0\n\n-8.0\n\n-6.0\n\n-4.0\n\n-2.0\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\nCn\n\n%\nA\n\nD\n\nTr=0.45\nTr=0.50\nTr=0.55\nTr=0.60\nTr=0.65\nTr=0.70\nTr=0.75\n\n-10.0\n\n-8.0\n\n-6.0\n\n-4.0\n\n-2.0\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40\n\nCn\n\n%\nA\n\nD\n\nTr=0.45\nTr=0.50\nTr=0.55\nTr=0.60\nTr=0.65\nTr=0.70\nTr=0.75\n\n\n\nThe Corresponding States Principle \n\n- 103 - \n\nFigure III. 9: Average deviation of the reduced liquid density predicted with the linear \nperturbation model as a function of the chain length of the n-alkane. \n\nFigure III. 10: Average deviation of the reduced liquid density predicted with the second-order \nperturbation model as a function of the chain length of the n-alkane. \n\n \n\n-2.0\n\n0.0\n\n2.0\n\n4.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40\nCn\n\n%\nA\n\nD\n\nTr=0.45\n\nTr=0.50\n\nTr=0.55\n\nTr=0.60\n\nTr=0.65\n\nTr=0.70\n\nTr=0.75\n\n-2.0\n\n-1.0\n\n0.0\n\n1.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n4.0\n\n0 10 20 30 40 Cn\n\n%\nA\n\nD\n\nTr=0.45\n\nTr=0.50\n\nTr=0.55\n\nTr=0.60\n\nTr=0.65\n\nTr=0.70\n\nTr=0.75\n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 104 - \n\nFigure III. 11:  Average deviation of the reduced viscosity predicted with the linear perturbation \nmodel as a function of the chain length of the n-alkane. \n\nFigure III. 12: Average deviation of the reduced viscosity predicted with the 2nd order \nperturbation model as a function of the chain length of the n-alkane. \n\n \n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n0 10 20 30 40 Cn\n\n%\nA\n\nD\n\nTr=0.45\n\nTr=0.50\n\nTr=0.55\n\nTr=0.60\n\nTr=0.65\n\nTr=0.70\n\nTr=0.75\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n0 10 20 30 40 Cn\n\n%\nA\n\nD\n\nTr=0.45\n\nTr=0.50\n\nTr=0.55\n\nTr=0.60\n\nTr=0.65\n\nTr=0.70\n\nTr=0.75\n\n\n\nThe Corresponding States Principle \n\n- 105 - \n\nThe 2nd order perturbation model (Eq.

Two main approaches have been applied in this parameterization: the first \n\nperforms a multi-parameter Taylor\u2019s series expansion of the property of interest about the \n\nparameters, as has been seen above with the Pitzer acentric factor; the second approach is \n\nto extend the simple two-parameter corresponding states principle at its molecular origin, \n\nby making the intermolecular potential parameters functions of the additional \n\ncharacterization parameters and the thermodynamic state, e.g. the temperature, with the \n\nend result being a corresponding states model that has the same mathematical form as the \n\nsimple two-parameter model, but with more complex definitions of the dimensionless \n\nvolume and temperature, involving the so-called shape factors. This is usually recognized \n\nas the Extended Corresponding States Theory (Ely et al., 2000; Marrucho, 1996).

III.8. \n\nThe relationship between these quantities is given by: \n\n \n\n?==\nc1\n\njc\n1j1\n\nV\n\nV\nVhVV    ?==\n\nc1\n\njc\n1j1\n\nT\n\nT\nTfTT    (III. 21) \n\n \n\nThe shape factors are weak functions of the reduced temperature and, in principle, of \n\nthe reduced density. They may be evaluated by solving simultaneously any two equations \n\nrelating the thermophysical property of the target and the reference fluid. Normally the \n\ncompressibility factor and the Helmholtz energy are used. Several review papers have been \n\npublished focusing on this approach and the most extensive are those of Leland et al. \n\n(1968), Rowlinson et al. (1969) and Mentzer et al. (1980). \n\nIn order to apply the extended corresponding states theory to interfacial tension, \n\nMurad (1983) calculated shape factors by the simultaneous solution of the reduced \n\ncompressibility factors and the reduced surface tensions. The values of these shape factors \n\nwere then fitted to functions of the temperature and density, using the formulae proposed \n\nby Leach et al. (1968). \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 112 - \n\nThis procedure has the disadvantage of yielding shape factors that are not the same of \n\nthose obtained by solving the compressibility factor and the Helmholtz energy. Since, \n\ntheoretically, these shape factors should be the same, recalculation of these shape factors \n\nshowed that this difference was essentially due to the lack of accuracy of the reference \n\nfluid data available at the time. Another weak point of the model proposed by  \n\nMurad (1983) was the fixed reference fluid, methane, which does not allow an accurate \n\nmapping for heavy n-alkanes. \n\nFollowing Cullick et al. (1982), Marrucho et al. (1998) proposed a new predictive \n\nmethod for the determination of the shape factors along the saturation boundary. Using the \n\nFrost-Kalkwarf-Thodos (Frost et al., 1953) equation to describe the saturation pressure and \n\nthe Rackett equation (Rackett, 1970) for the saturated liquid density, the expressions for \n\nthe shape factors are: \n\n \n\n( ) ( )\nrj1r1r\n\nrjrjrjrr1ccj\n7/2\n\nrj1r\n\nT/BC1\n\nT/BTlnCBZ/ZlnT12C1\n\n+?\n+?+???+?\n\n=?

III.22 - III.27, for several n-alkanes, C2H6-C20H42, C26H54 and C32H66 are \n\ncompared with experimental results. An average absolute deviation (Eq. I.7) of 3.7 % was \n\nobtained. The selected reference fluids were n-C5H12 for the range [C2H6, n-C7H16],  \n\nn-C10H22 for [n-C8H18, n-C12H26] and n-C15H32 for those n-alkanes with more than 12 \n\ncarbon atoms. Interfacial tension for n-hexacontane (n-C60H122) was not predicted due to \n\nthe lack of a suitable reference fluid. Some deviations were found for the first elements of \n\nthe series, but it should be kept in mind that experimental data for some fluids, like \n\npropane and n-butane, presents scatter. \n\nWhen using this model, special care should be presented in the choice of the reference \n\nfluid.

This difference is due to the larger number of \n\nreference fluids used in the 2nd order perturbation, making it a good tool when \n\ninterpolations/extrapolations of the reference system data are required. \n\nThe extended corresponding states model is particularly useful when not more than \n\none reference fluid is available, but if the reference fluid is not similar to the evaluating \n\nfluid, larger deviations can occur. \n\nFigure III. 16: Comparison of experimental (?, n-C26H54; ?, n-C16H34; ?, n-C14H30; ?, n-C8H18;  \n\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7\u00d7, n-C6H14; ?, n-C4H10; ?, n-C3H8; +, C2H6) and predicted (?) interfacial tension \nfor n-alkanes- using the ECST model. \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n100 200 300 400 500 600\n\nT/K\n\n?? ??\n/m\n\nN\n.m\n\n-1\n\n\n\nThe Corresponding States Principle \n\n- 115 - \n\nFigure III. 17: Experimental (?) and predicted (?, 2nd order perturbation; --, ECST) interfacial \ntensions of n-heptane. \n\n \n\nFor that reason, during the remaining of this chapter, only the new 2nd order \n\ncorresponding states model will be used. \n\n \n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n150 250 350 450 550 650\nT/K\n\n?? ??\n/m\n\nN\n.m\n\n-1\n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 116 - \n\nIII.2.2. Simple Mixtures \n\n \n\nThe simplest and most used method for extending the corresponding states principle to \n\nmixtures is the one-fluid approach. Each mixture, is considered to have mixture critical \n\nproperties and acentric factor than can be replaced in the corresponding states formalism \n\nby equivalent pure component properties calculated via adequate mixing and combining \n\nrules. \n\nIn this section, mixtures were evaluated with the new 2nd order perturbation model  \n\n(Eq.

III.28 - III.32, experimental critical properties and correlations for \n\ntheir estimation were selected, as presented in section II.2. \n\nFollowing Coutinho et al. (2000) a more general combining rule for the cross-critical \n\ntemperature, Tcik, was adopted (Eq. III.32). It was shown that for phase equilibrium \n\ncalculations, the geometric mean rule (n = 6) progressively deteriorates with component \n\n\n\nThe Corresponding States Principle \n\n- 117 - \n\nasymmetry, with the value of n approaching 3 for extremely asymmetric systems, such as \n\nthose involving some polymer solutions. \n\nOther combining rules can be derived from this expression setting different values of \n\nthe n parameter. Setting n = 3, one obtains the geometric combining rule. \n\nPl\u00f6cker et al. (1978) used n = 3.75 for calculating vapor-liquid equilibria of asymmetric \n\nsystems. Other values between 3 and 7.5 can also be found (Coutinho et al., 2000). The n \n\nparameter can thus be fitted or used as variable with the system asymmetry, and thus no \n\nbinary interaction parameters are required while using this approach. \n\nThe optimum values of n to be used with Eq. III.32 were estimated from the data \n\nmeasured in this work (Part I) and other binary mixture data from literature. The following \n\nobjective function was used within a least-squares fit: \n\n \n\n?\n\t\n\n\n\n?\n?\n\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\u00d7???\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\u00d7?= ??\n\ni\neliielm\n\ni\niim XxXXxXFobj mod,mod,exp,exp,   (III. 33) \n\n \n\nwhere subscript m denotes mixture and exp experimental value. \n\nWhile using this objective function, we consider that the 2nd order corresponding states \n\nmodel returns the correct pure component values of the thermophysical property and that \n\nonly the curvature of the property vs. composition (the excess values) need to be corrected. \n\nFor vapor-liquid interfacial tension an n value of 4.6 was obtained from this overall fit. \n\nTo show how this model can represent mixture vapor-liquid interfacial tension using a \n\nsmall amount of experimental information, n-heptane, n-decane and n-eicosane were \n\nselected as reference fluids, and only the measurements reported in I.2.1, taken in a small \n\nreduced temperature range, were selected. For each reference fluid, interfacial tension was \n\nfitted to a two-parameter equation (Eq. III.8). \n\nDeviations are presented for 18 binary and 2 ternary n-alkane mixtures in Table III. 9 \n\nusing n = 4.6 and n = 6.0 in Eq. III.32. As can be seen, for low asymmetries the best choice \n\nis to use n = 6.0, while for the most asymmetric mixtures, deviations can be reduced to half \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 118 - \n\nof their value if we select n = 4.6. An average absolute deviation of 1.1 % was found. \n\nUsing n = 6 in Eq. III.32, an average absolute deviation about 80 % higher was obtained. \n\nA comparison between the model using n = 4.6 and experimental data is shown in \n\nFigures III.18 \u2013 III.22. \n\nWith respect to the comparison between the binary and the ternary data, very small \n\ndeviations are observed using this model, in agreement with the experimental results. \n\nBinary data calculated from the model are, in average, 0.3 % higher than that of the \n\nequivalent ternary mixture. Similar results can be obtained from the experimental values, \n\nas was noted in I.2.1. \n\nResults show that using only 4 to 8 pure component interfacial tension values from \n\neach reference fluid, one is able to estimate all the corresponding mixture data with a very \n\nsmall deviation. These results clearly show that the proposed 2nd order corresponding states \n\nmodel is adequate for the liquid-vapor interfacial tension modeling of hydrocarbon \n\nmixtures. \n\nIn Table III. 10 and Figures III.23 \u2013 III.24 it is shown how this simple model can \n\nreturn liquid density estimates that deviate from the experimental data as much as different \n\nsets of data deviate between themselves. The previously suggested reference system \n\nCH4+n-C15H32+n-C26H54 was selected to obtain the reported results, using n =6 in  \n\nEq. III.32. As can be seen from the results, no need for further model refinement is \n\nrequired, and the model can be kept predictive for this property. \n\nFor the viscosity modeling of the reported asymmetric systems, an optimized n value \n\nis essential to reduce the absolute percent deviations below 10 %, but no need for system \n\ndependent n-values was found. Using n= -1.5, very good viscosity estimates were obtained, \n\nas reported on Table III. 10 and Figures III.25 \u2013 III.26. \n\nAlthough typical n-values are in the range 3 - 7.5 (Coutinho et al., 2000), viscosity \n\nmodeling using the corresponding states theory with the one-fluid concept presents several \n\nsimplifications, particularly for asymmetric mixtures, as discussed by Ely et al. (1981). \n\nTherefore, the optimized value of n =-1.5 accounts for these simplifications, and should \n\nthus be considered as a fitting parameter. Only binary mixture data was used for the \n\noptimization. The previously suggested viscosity reference system, \n\nC2H6+n-C8H18+n-C18H38 was selected to obtain the reported results. \n\n\n\nThe Corresponding States Principle \n\n- 119 - \n\nTable III. 9: Estimation of the interfacial tension of n-alkane mixtures for different \nvalues of n (Eq.

Gradient Theory of Fluid Interfaces \n\n \n\nAlthough very powerful for the description of interfacial tensions and density profiles \n\nacross the interface, the gradient theory has not been widely used due to its mathematical \n\ncomplexity. Most of the proposed applications are limited to the liquid-vapor interface of \n\nsome polar and non-polar fluids and simple mixtures (Cornelisse et al., 1996; Kahl et al., \n\n2000 and 2002; Miqueu, 2001; Miqueu et al. 2003, 2004; Zuo et al., 1997b and 1998). Few \n\nauthors (Kahl et al., 2000 and 2002; Zuo et al., 1998) have attempted to model  \n\nliquid-liquid interfaces and only recently (Kahl et al., 2002) an associating equation of \n\nstate was used for addressing liquid-liquid systems containing associating components. \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 126 - \n\nGradient theory is based on the knowledge of the equilibrium phase densities and the \n\nHelmholtz free energy density as calculated from an equation of state. For that purpose, the \n\nCPA EOS (Cubic-plus-Association Equation of State), an association state-of-the-art \n\nthermodynamic model which combines a physical contribution from a cubic EOS with an \n\nassociation contribution derived from Wertheim theory, was selected. This EOS has \n\nalready shown to be an accurate model to describe the vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) and \n\nthe liquid-liquid equilibria (LLE) of mixtures containing water, alkanes and alcohols \n\n(Derawi, 2002; Kontogeorgis et al., 1996 and 1999; Voutsas et al., 2000; Wu et al., 1998; \n\nYakoumis et al., 1998). Particularly for water-alkane systems, CPA is actually the only \n\nmodel that provides acceptable results for both the solubility of water in the  \n\nhydrocarbon-phase and the hydrocarbon solubility in the aqueous phase (Voutsas et al., \n\n2000; Yakoumis et al., 1998). The good performance of this EOS for systems containing \n\nwater and n-alkanes justified the study of its coupling with the gradient theory, as will be \n\nshown during this section. \n\nFor the non-associating components chosen for evaluation, two cubic equations of \n\nstate, the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) (Soave,1972) and the Peng-Robinson (PR)  \n\n(Peng et al., 1974) were selected for comparison with the CPA equation of state. \n\n \n\nGradient theory \n\nThe gradient theory of fluid interfaces originated from the work of van der Waals, but \n\nonly after Cahn et al., (1958) found widespread use. Since 1958 it has been applied for the \n\nmodeling of the liquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interfacial tension of different systems such \n\nas polar and non-polar fluids and some polymers. Recently, Miqueu and co-workers \n\ngeneralized the gradient theory for multicomponent mixtures (Miqueu, 2001;  \n\nMiqueu et al., 2004): \n\n \n\nN\ni j N\n\nj\n\nN\n\ni\nijN1 d\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\nd\nc),...,(2\n\nliq\nN\n\nvap\nN\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n????=? ? ??\n?\n\n?\n    (III. 34) \n\np),...(),...,( N1N1 ????=????

For practical purposes, the influence parameter is adjusted from \n\ninterfacial tension data (Cornelisse et al., 1996; Kahl et al., 2000, 2002; Miqueu, 2001; \n\nMiqueu et al. 2003, 2004; Zuo et al., 1997, 1998): \n\n \n\n2\n\nexp\nii liq\n\nvap\nd)(2\n\n1\nc\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n????\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n       (III. 37) \n\n \n\nThe influence parameter should diverge close to the critical point, where interfacial \n\ntension vanishes. \n\nFor mixtures, cross influence parameters, cij, are calculated from the pure component \n\ninfluence parameters using a geometric mean rule: \n\n \n\njjiiij ccc =          (III. 38) \n\n \n\nA binary interaction parameter can be included in Eq.

Higher deviations \n\nare obtained close to the critical point, as expected from a classical EOS  \n\n(Voutsas et al., 2000). Still, results are better or similar to those obtained from the SRK or \n\nthe PR EOS, as the equation of state parameters were fitted to the experimental liquid \n\ndensities and vapor pressures. As a result of this parameter fitting, considerable \n\nimprovements can be found with CPA on the equilibrium liquid phase densities, as can be \n\nseen in Figure III. 28 \n\nLimitations on the use of classical cubic EOS for the estimation of liquid phase \n\ndensities are known, and a regular procedure to overcome this problem is to include a \n\nvolume translation as suggested by Peneloux et al.

As shown for n-heptane in Figure III. 33, the three EOS present the \n\nsame behavior in the 1-Tr range above 0.2, but for CPA the behavior close to the critical \n\npoint is exactly the opposite of that found for SRK or PR. This qualitative trend is not in \n\nagreement with the theoretical definition of the influence parameter and the scaling laws \n\nnear the critical point (Miqueu, 2001), and should be the consequence of considering \n\nduring the fitting of the influence parameter, two different critical temperatures: one given \n\nby the CPA EOS and a second one implicit on the experimental interfacial tension data \n\nused for the fitting (that is, when ? =0). \n\nSince it is known that SRK, PR and CPA cannot adequately represent the critical \n\nregion and since for most of the practical purposes, the temperature range of interest will \n\nbe in the 1-Tr range above 0.2, a polynomial correlation can be used for the CPA influence \n\nparameter in order to obtain a fast estimate of the interfacial tension. As proposed before \n\n(Miqueu, 2001, Miqueu et al., 2003 and 2004) a linear correlation for c/ab2/3 as a function \n\nof 1-Tr is sufficient for the modeling of interfacial tensions when using a cubic EOS, but as \n\ncan be observed from Figs III.33 \u2013 III.35, a quadratic correlation seems more appropriate \n\nwhile using CPA, especially for water: \n\n \n\n2\n3/2\n\n)1()1( rr TFTED\nab\n\nc\n?\u00d7+?\u00d7+=       (III. 50) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nGradient Theory of Fluid Interfaces \n\n- 137 - \n\nFigure III. 33:  n-heptane influence parameters.

It is known that cubic equations of state cannot provide \n\naccurate liquid density estimates of heavy hydrocarbons, with a common solution being the \n\nincorporation of a volume translation that does not change the equilibrium and improves \n\nconsiderably the liquid phase volumetric properties (Pen\u00e9loux et al., 1982). For the \n\npurposes of this work, following the approach used before with the friction theory, a \n\ndifferent approach was taken. Critical parameters (Tc and Pc) were fitted to the liquid \n\ndensities in order to better describe both the liquid densities and viscosities, since a good \n\nEOS pressure description is required within the f-theory. The fitted critical parameters are \n\nreported in Table III. 15, and no longer retain their physical meaning. Table III. 14 and \n\nFigures III.39 \u2013 III.42 show how the Peng-Robinson EOS can now adequately represent \n\nliquid densities. \n\nGood viscosity predictions are also obtained with the friction theory, as can be seen \n\nfrom Figures III.43-III.46 with the largest deviations found for the ternary systems and the \n\nmost asymmetric mixtures containing n-heptane. No mixture information was used in \n\neither the EOS or in the f-theory. The heavier but less asymmetric mixture,  \n\nn-C16H34 + n-C20H42 shows that this viscosity model can give reliable results for heavy \n\ncomponents, thus supporting the idea that the larger deviations in the mixtures containing \n\nn-heptane arise from their asymmetry. \n\nWithin the same mixture, major deviations were found at the lowest temperatures, \n\nwhere viscosity measurements are harder to perform, and thus more uncertain. At these \n\ntemperatures, the PR EOS also showed the largest liquid density deviations, from which \n\nlarger viscosity deviations may be expected from the f-theory. \n\n \n\n\n\nFriction Theory \n\n- 145 - \n\nTable III. 14: Modeling results with pure component properties for the f-theory and \nthe PR EOS reported in Table III. 15. \n\naverage absolute deviation (% AAD)a \n\nMixture \n????, f-theory ?, ?, ?, ?, PR EOS \n\nn-C7H16 \u2013 n-C20H42 7.1 0.8 \nn-C7H16 \u2013 n-C22H46 7.5 0.6 \nn-C7H16 \u2013 n-C24H50 8.0 0.7 \nn-C10H22 \u2013 n-C20H42 4.2 0.52 \nn-C10H22 \u2013 n-C22H46 4.2 0.43 \nn-C10H22 \u2013 n-C24H50 3.8 0.37 \nn-C16H34 \u2013 n-C20H42 2.0 0.6 \nn-C7H16 \u2013 n-C20H42 \u2013 n-C24H50 9.1 0.7 \nn-C10H22 \u2013 n-C20H42 \u2013 n-C24H50 9.2 0.55 \n   \nAverage (all data points) 6.0 0.6 \n\nEq.

Solid \u2013 Liquid Equilibria in Hydrocarbon \n\nFluids \n\n \n\nThe new European standards for automotive fuels, issued under the Auto-Oil program \n\n(1996), are changing the way fuels are produced. There is a clear trend towards more \n\nparaffinic fuels (Neale, 1997; Mota, 1998), with better combustion habits, and thus more \n\nenvironmentally friendly, but that will have a worst behavior at low temperatures \n\npresenting higher cloud and pour points. \n\nThe solubility of long n-alkanes strongly decreases with temperature and, for diesels, \n\nbelow 280 K, the exact liquid-solid transition temperatures depend on the n-alkane content \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 152 - \n\nand its distribution. Below this temperature, crystals of n-alkanes start precipitating, \n\nplugging pipes and fuel filters. \n\nThe production of fuels that simultaneously conform to the new European standards \n\nand the low temperature behavior restrictions will demand either an increasing use of \n\nadditives, such as pour point depressants, or the redesign of the distillation to reduce the \n\nconcentration of n-alkanes to an acceptable level. For this purpose it is important to be able \n\nto relate the n-alkane crystallization with the composition of the fluid. This will help to \n\nadequately design the production and blend of fuels, and to select the most adequate \n\nadditives (Wang et al., 1999). \n\nThe solid formation was described in this section as a solid-liquid equilibrium of  \n\nn-alkanes. The general solid-liquid equilibrium equation relating the compositions with the \n\nnon-ideality of the phases and the pure component thermophysical properties was used \n\n(Prausnitz et al., 1999): \n\n \n\ni\n\n1\nT\n\nT\n\nT\n\nT\nln\n\nR\n\nCp\n1\n\nT\n\nT\n\nRT\n\nh\n1\n\nT\n\nT\n\nRT\n\nh\n\nx\n\ns\nln m\n\nm\n\nmsltr\n\ntr\n\ntrm\n\nm\n\nm\nl\n\ns\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?+\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n+?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n=\n\n?\n\n?

The \n\nuse of this model for the liquid phase would require a more detailed knowledge of its \n\ncomposition such as a PIONA analysis or equivalent. However, the non-ideality of the \n\nliquid phase is not very significant (Erikson et al, 1983) and as discussed in a previous \n\nwork (Coutinho, 2000c) to consider the solvent composed of 25 % of aromatics or being \n\nfully paraffinic does not change the low temperature behavior of a solution. To simplify \n\nthe approach an ideal liquid phase was be adopted in this section. \n\n \n\n\n\nSolid-Liquid Equilibrium in Hydrocarbon Fluids \n\n- 153 - \n\nThe solid phase non-ideality was described by the Predictive UNIQUAC model \n\n(Coutinho et al., 1996; Coutinho, 1998).

No other information is required about the composition of the \n\nfluid. \n\nAs discussed above, an ideal liquid phase will be assumed and thus no differentiation \n\nwill be done between aliphatic and aromatic compounds in the liquid phase. A single \n\npseudo-compound will be used to describe the liquid phase. Its concentration is given by \n\nthe concentration of non n-alkanes obtained from the GC analysis. The choice of the \n\npseudo-compound is done by matching the average molecular weight of the pseudo-\n\nsolution used in the calculation with the measured average molecular weight. \n\nFigure III. 47: Comparison between the experimental (????) and calculated (?) percentage of \ncrystallized paraffins in a n-C10H22+n-C24H50+n-C25H52+n-C26H54 mixture (mol%, \nrespectively, 80%, 7.71% 6.62% and 5.67%) (Pauly et al., 2004) \n\n0\n\n25\n\n50\n\n75\n\n100\n\n275 285 295 305\nT/K\n\n%\n\n\n\nSolid-Liquid Equilibrium in Hydrocarbon Fluids \n\n- 155 - \n\nCalculated wax appearance temperatures (WAT) are compared with the calculated \n\nexperimental results in Table III. 16. \n\n \n\nTable III. 16: Comparison between measured and predicted wax appearance \ntemperature (WAT) \n\nDistillation cut Measured WAT/K Predicted WAT/K Deviation/K \n\nBrent 273.8 272.7 1.1 \nOso Condensate 278.9 277.5 1.4 \nTroll 265.6 265.3 0.3 \nDUC 256.2 256.6 0.4 \nSahara Blend 271.2 271.1 0.1 \n    \n\nAverage deviation   0.66 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe experimental and model precipitation curves obtained are presented in  \n\nFigure III. 48.

For the samples studied in \n\nthis work the WAT\u2019s nicely correlate with the total n-alkane content as shown in  \n\nFigure III. 49. Unfortunately, as has been shown before (Reddy, 1986; Rossmyr, 1979; \n\nMirante et al., 2001), this sort of correlation cannot be generalized to fluids with n-alkane \n\ndistributions different than those used in the development of the correlation, as the WAT is \n\nhighly dependent on the n-alkane distribution besides the total content. \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 156 - \n\nFigure III. 48:  Measured and predicted precipitation curves for distillation cuts from Brent a), \nOso Condensate b), Troll c), DUC d), and Sahara Blend e). \n\n\n\nSolid-Liquid Equilibrium in Hydrocarbon Fluids \n\n- 157 - \n\nFigure III.46:  (continued) \n\n \n\nSome recent results for crudes (Ronningsen et al., 1991; Delmas et al., 2000) show \n\nthat the total n-alkane content in waxy crudes is related to the average molecular weight of \n\nthe fluid. For the distillation cuts studied and other fuels from literature (Coutinho et al., \n\n2000; Reddy, 1986) it was found that such relation does not exist. The data in Table I. 14 \n\nclearly illustrates this. \n\n \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 158 - \n\nFigure III. 49:  Relation between total n-alkane content and wax appearance temperatures for the \nstudied cuts. \n\n \n\nAs can be seen, the model predictions agree very well with the experimental \n\nprecipitation curves. Even for very low total n-alkane contents as for the cut from DUC oil, \n\nwhich contains only 2.8 wt% of n-alkanes, and a WAT of 256 K, an excellent description \n\nof the experimental data is obtained. Due to the feeble n-alkane content the DSC \n\nmeasurement for this fluid was particularly difficult due to the low intensity of the energy \n\nmeasured and thus a larger experimental error is associated to this measurement. \n\nGenerally, it seems that the model slightly underestimates the measured precipitation \n\ncurves. Since the DSC measurements are performed with a heating rate, that does not \n\nassure that the equilibrium is attained in the sample, the temperatures measured are slightly \n\noverestimated and this may explain the deviations between the experimental data and the \n\nmodel predictions. Other reason may reside in the inadequacies of the baseline chosen. \n\nModel limitations would also be another obvious explanation given the huge \n\nsimplifications made in what concerns the sample composition. Nevertheless, and taking \n\ninto account all the simplifications used and assumptions done, the model predictions and \n\nthe experimental data present a surprisingly good agreement. The proposed model, using \n\nonly the information from a GC analysis, can thus provide a quick and reliable estimate of \n\nthe low temperature behavior of the fuel and could easily be used to plan fuel blends to \n\nmeet some given low temperature specifications. \n\n\n\nSolid-Liquid Equilibrium in Hydrocarbon Fluids \n\n- 159 - \n\nAs suggested before, for the distillation cuts studied it would be possible to develop a \n\ncorrelation to predict the wax appearance temperature from the total n-alkane content. \n\nGiven the similarity of the n-alkane distributions among the studied samples, that appears \n\nto be completely independent of the total n-alkane content. \n\nIt would also be possible, from the results presented, to propose an average n-alkane \n\ndistribution for 230-375 \u00baC distillation cuts. Such a distribution was previously presented \n\nin Table I. 14. By using the average distribution, only a measurement of the total n-alkane \n\ncontent would be required to apply the model for obtaining a reliable estimate of the low \n\ntemperature behavior of the fuel. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions \n\n- 161 - \n\nIII.6. Conclusions \n\n \n\nA new corresponding states model was proposed for the estimation of vapor pressures, \n\nliquid densities vapor-liquid interfacial tensions and viscosities of the series of the n-\n\nalkanes. This model is predictive and only uses experimental information from the \n\nreference fluids and the critical properties and acentric factor from the target fluid. \n\nThe inclusion of the second order term in the Taylor series expansion of the reduced \n\nproperty about the Pitzer acentric factor, has proved to improve the predicting abilities of \n\nthe corresponding states principle for the entire n-alkane series, particularly for the heavier \n\ncomponents. Other properties such as thermal conductivity and speed of sound showed the \n\nsame trend of the reduced property as a function of the acentric factor, which are \n\nencouraging results for extending this model for other thermophysical properties. \n\nA reference systems was proposed for each property. Using this new 2nd order \n\nperturbation framework only one reference system should be enough to predict the entire \n\nn-alkane series. Since this model is mathematically able to represent the reduced property \n\nas function of the acentric factor, it is expected to interpolate/extrapolate better than the \n\nlinear approach presented before in the literature. \n\nThe extended corresponding states theory was also suggested for the determination of \n\nliquid-vapor interfacial tension, this time with the possibility of selecting an adequate \n\nreference fluid and given a minimum amount of information: critical temperature, critical \n\nvolume, critical compressibility factor and acentric factor of the reference and the target \n\nfluid as well as some interfacial tension data from the reference fluid. Although this last \n\napproach has shown notable deviation, it is much simpler to use and involves less \n\nexperimental information. The existence of a suitable reference fluid is particularly \n\nimportant for this model. \n\nVery good mixture liquid density results were obtained from the 2nd order \n\ncorresponding states model. Viscosity and interfacial tension estimation using this model \n\nrequire the optimization of the cross-critical temperature combining rule, but using a \n\nsystem independent n parameter, very good results are obtained. \n\n\n\nPart III: Modeling \n\n- 162 - \n\nThe correct volumetric and phase behavior resulting from the CPA EOS was presented \n\nand discussed in order to evaluate the use of this equation of state in the framework of the \n\ngradient theory of fluid interfaces. Using correlations to obtain the cubic and associative \n\nterm pure component parameters, it was found that the saturated liquid phase densities \n\ncould be obtained with a high accuracy with no need to perform any volume correction as \n\nusually needed while using cubic EOS with energy and co-volume parameters calculated \n\nfrom critical properties. \n\nHighly accurate data on pure water, n-butane, n-pentane, n-hexane, n-heptane and \n\nethanol were selected to calculate the pure component gradient theory influence parameters \n\nand from these a quadratic correlation was proposed from which interfacial tension can be \n\nobtained in the reduced temperature range below 0.8 with average errors of less than  \n\n1.5 %. Although this correlation was presented for a limited range of reduced temperatures, \n\nit was found that qualitative results could be obtained in the full liquid range for the \n\nselected components evaluated on this work. Future developments shall focus on mixtures \n\nand liquid-liquid interfaces. \n\nThe friction theory, a general and recently proposed model for viscosity, that has \n\nalready shown to be able to model several fluid mixtures over a broad temperature and \n\npressure range, was used to describe the measured viscosity and liquid density data. In \n\ncombination with the Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state and after fitting the pure component \n\ncritical properties to improve the description of the liquid densities, a good representation \n\nof the viscosities resulted from the f-theory. As compared with the previously proposed 2nd \n\norder corresponding states model it was shown that the second was the most adequate for \n\nthe accurate modeling of the asymmetric n-alkane mixtures presented in Part I. \n\nDistillation cuts from five crude oils commonly used for fuel production, had their low \n\ntemperature behavior studied. Precipitation curves were predicted by a thermodynamic \n\nmodel assuming ideal liquid phase and a solid phase whose non-ideality was described by \n\nthe Predictive UNIQUAC model. It was shown that the model provides an accurate \n\ndescription of the experimental data and can thus be used for a quick estimate of the low \n\ntemperature behavior of a fuel or to plan fuel blends to meet existing regulations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nFinal Conclusions \n\n- 163 - \n\nFinal Conclusions \n\n \n\nSeveral experimental measurements were presented on properties such as vapor-liquid \n\nand liquid-liquid interfacial tensions, liquid densities and viscosities. Measurements were \n\nperformed in six pure n-alkanes: n-C7H16, n-C10H22, n-C16H34, n-C20H42, n-C22H46 and  \n\nn-C24H50, 7 binary mixtures (n-C7H16 + n-C20H42, n-C7H16 + n-C22H46, n-C7H16 + n-C24H50, \n\nn-C10H22 + n-C20H42, n-C10H22 + n-C22H46, n-C10H22 + n-C24H50, n-C16H34 + n-C20H42), and \n\ntwo ternary mixtures (n-C7H16 + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50, n-C10H22 + n-C20H42 + n-C24H50). \n\nAdditionally, to check the performance of the new Nima DST9005 tensiometer, the  \n\nvapor-liquid interfacial tension of the mixtures n-C7H16 + n-C10H22, n-C7H16 + n-C16H34, \n\nand n-C10H22 + n-C16H34, were also considered. As shown during Part I the selected \n\nequipment presented deviations with respect to pure component literature data of 1 % for \n\ninterfacial tension, 2% for viscosity and 0.1% for liquid density, thus showing their ability \n\nto measure with accuracy. \n\nMeasurements were also performed on five petroleum distillation cuts in order to \n\nobtain some representative data for real systems containing heavier n-alkanes. These \n\nfractions were also characterized in terms of their molecular weights, n-alkane composition \n\n(gas chromatography) and solid-liquid equilibria (differential scanning calorimetry). \n\nBinary and ternary data were compared to check if, in a mixture, a single component, \n\nn-C22H46, is different from an equimolar mixture of other two, n-C20H42 + n-C24H50. For all \n\nthe properties it was found that the binaries presented higher values of the thermophysical \n\nproperty than the equivalent ternaries, although for liquid densities the difference was very \n\nsmall. \n\nDuring Part II correlations were considered. Since for the correct modeling, accurate \n\npure component properties, namely, critical temperature, critical pressure, critical volume \n\nand Pitzer acentric factor are required, it was first reviewed the available literature data and \n\nafterwards assessed some of the available correlations to extend the data for n-alkanes for \n\nwhich no experimental information existed. It was found that the Tsonopoulos (1987) \n\ncorrelation presented the best agreement with critical temperatures,  \n\nthe Magoulas et al. (1990) correlation with the critical pressures, the Marano et al. (1997a) \n\n\n\nFinal Conclusions \n\n- 164 - \n\ncorrelation with the critical volumes and the Han et al. (1993) correlation with the acentric \n\nfactors. \n\nLater in this chapter, a relation between liquid-vapor interfacial tension and viscosity \n\nwas presented and discussed. Some interesting conclusions came out from this relation, as \n\nsome chain length effects, the applicability of pure component parameters for mixtures and \n\nthe possibility of correlating the parameters as a function of chain length or the molecular \n\nweight. Very good estimates of liquid-vapor interfacial tensions were obtained from \n\nviscosities, while viscosities obtained from interfacial tensions presented higher deviations. \n\nIn Part III it was shown how the corresponding states principle can be used to model \n\nseveral thermophysical properties of the entire n-alkane series based on three reference \n\nfluids. Plots of the reduced properties as a function of the acentric factor were presented to \n\nshow that the trend is not linear, as proposed before, and that results are considerably \n\nimproved if we add the second order term of the Taylor series expansion. The obtained \n\naverage absolute deviations for a broad range of pure n-alkane data were 1.1 % for the \n\nvapor-liquid interfacial tension, 3.7 % for viscosity and 0.6 % for liquid density. \n\nThe application of this model to mixtures is straightforward, via adequate mixing \n\nrules. To obtain the best results for asymmetric systems, an adjustable parameter, \n\ntheoretically valid, was introduced in the combining rule for the cross-critical temperature. \n\nDeviations were 1.1 % for vapor-liquid interfacial tensions, 4.6 % for viscosity and 0.7 % \n\nfor liquid densities, which are quite close to the deviations found for the pure component \n\nproperties. For liquid density no need for an adjustable parameter was required and so the \n\nreported results are pure predictions. For interfacial tension it was noted that the new 2nd \n\norder corresponding states model could adequately represent the differences between \n\nequivalent (in terms of average chain length of the heavier components) binary and ternary \n\ndata. \n\nBased on the good performance of the gradient theory of fluid interfaces at describing \n\ninterfacial tensions, and that of the CPA equation of sate for water-n-alkane phase \n\nequilibria, in section III.3 a combination of these models was evaluated for the estimation \n\nof equilibrium pressures and densities and vapor-liquid interfacial tensions of non-\n\nassociating (n-alkanes) and associating (water and ethanol) components. Preliminary \n\nresults are encouraging, but a considerable body of modeling work remains to be done. \n\n\n\nFinal Conclusions \n\n- 165 - \n\nViscosities and liquid densities were also modeled using the friction theory, a \n\nstate-of-the-the-art viscosity model, based on the repulsive and attractive contributions for \n\npressure as given by a cubic equation of state. For the application of this theory to the \n\nmixtures reported in Part I, it was found necessary to tune the critical temperature and \n\npressure of the heavier components, so that both good density and viscosity results were \n\nobtained. It this way, critical temperature and critical pressure no longer have any physical \n\nmeaning and should be considered as fitting parameters. Obtained average deviations were \n\n6.0 % for viscosity and 0.6 % for liquid density. As compared with the new corresponding \n\nstates model it was found that, for the systems evaluated in this thesis, the corresponding \n\nstates model gave better results, while using less experimental pure component \n\ninformation. \n\nA model to predict the solid-liquid equilibria in paraffinic systems presented by \n\nCoutinho (1998) was used to describe the solid deposition curves measured for the \n\npetroleum cuts reported in Part I. Very good agreement was obtained, although the only \n\ncompositional analysis used by this model was that of the n.-allkanes. \n\n \n\nRegarding the presented results, it is now considered that enough experimental and \n\nmodeling work is available to describe systems containing both pure heavier n-alkanes or \n\ntheir mixtures with lighter components. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPerspectives for Future Work \n\n- 167 - \n\nThe most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds \n\nnew discoveries, is not \"Eureka!\" (I've found it), but \"That's \n\nfunny...\" \n\n \n\n3???????\t!?4??\n?5-?\n??5?????\t?????\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\nPerspectives for Future Work \n\n \n\nAlthough a considerable amount of data was presented on this thesis, an interfacial \n\ntension-viscosity relation was proposed, and some new and state-of-the-art models have \n\nbeen evaluated for thermophysical properties and solid-liquid equilibria of mixtures \n\ncontaining heavier n-alkanes, some questions remain to study or came up during this work \n\nthat deserve to be mentioned as objects for further study. \n\nWith respect to the experimental measurements, there is still a large amount of \n\nsystems for which experimental evidence remains unavailable. For liquid-liquid interfacial \n\ntensions the existing data is considerably reduced: only a narrow range of temperature \n\ndependent data are found for each system and pressure dependency are still more limited. \n\nFor modeling purposes data are particularly important, since only a few measurements may \n\nnot be sufficient for an adequate model evaluation and tuning. \n\nLiquid-liquid interfaces have a great potential as a research subject. Not only they are \n\ninvolved in industrial products such as coatings, paints, detergents and others, as well as \n\nthey are determining properties in some environmental processes, such as in an oil spill. \n\nThe effect of the nature and concentration of electrolytes in the interfacial tension is an \n\ninteresting topic since this may help us understand some phenomena happening in real \n\nsystems. \n\n\n\nPerspectives for Future Work \n\n- 168 - \n\nWith the new interest on nanomaterials, the interfacial properties are receiving \n\nincreased importance, since at this scale, interfaces play a determinant role. \n\nWith regard to other properties, while some new data have been added to literature on \n\nheavier n-alkanes and their mixtures, interest in heavier components, as for example the \n\nindustrial interest in paraffin wax for the design of phase change materials for energy \n\nstorage, may require additional measurements on thermal conductivities for n-alkanes, \n\neven some heavier than those reported on this thesis. With this new data, it will also be \n\npossible to verify the extension of the proposed models for larger molecules, and thus fill \n\nthe gap between short length molecules and polymers. \n\nIn Part II a relation between liquid-vapor interfacial tension and viscosity was \n\npresented for pure n-alkanes, their mixtures and some petroleum distillation cuts. Although \n\nthis relation may be used to estimate liquid-vapor interfacial tensions from viscosities, as \n\nmade by Pedersen et al.(1989), it also presented very interesting chain length effects as \n\nwell as some information about the solid phase of those systems. Not only it was found \n\nthat it was possible to relate a bulk phase transport property (viscosity) with an equilibrium \n\nsurface property (interfacial tension), but also that some information about the solid phase \n\ncould be taken from these. To my point of view, although this relation is still on the \n\ncorrelations domain, it deserves some further attention. \n\nViscosities, liquid densities and liquid-vapor interfacial tensions were successfully \n\nmodeled using an improved corresponding states model. Some results for vapor pressures, \n\nthermal conductivities and speeds of sound showed that this model may be easily extended \n\nto other properties. This is a point which remains to be issued. The extension to other \n\nfamilies of fluids is another research subject which may lead to the generalization of the \n\ncorresponding states model presented on this thesis. Ultimately, this shall be applied to real \n\nsystems, such as the studied petroleum distillation cuts, but for these a more detailed \n\ncompositional analysis (such as a PIONA) is required, since the measured properties are \n\nnot only determined by the n-alkanes. \n\nFinally, the combination of the gradient theory of fluid interfaces with an association \n\nequation of state, such as CPA, has a great potential for the estimation of both vapor-liquid \n\nand liquid-liquid interfacial tensions, phase equilibrium and density profiles across the \n\ninterface. The work presented in section III.3 is only the beginning of this subject, and the \n\n\n\nPerspectives for Future Work \n\n- 169 - \n\nfinal objectives are, of course, to be able to model real systems such as some petroleum \n\nfluids, that may contain heavier components or be mixed with a gas such as CO2, but also \n\nsome other \u201cnon-classical\u201d systems such as those containing aqueous mixtures of \n\nelectrolytes or alcohols involved in liquid-liquid interfaces. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n?\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences \n\n- 171 - \n\nReferences \n\n \n\n\u00c1guila-Hernandez, J.

Not only those \n\nthat help me with a model or provide me with some of their experimental data or \n\nassistance, but also those that during these four years have been around me making me \n\ncontinue, helping me restart from zero, understanding my bad humor, all that! \n\nA PhD thesis its not a result of a single individual. Instead, it represents the progress \n\nachieved by working on somebody\u2019s results. To all those that came before me, and took \n\nme a lot of work, many thanks! Many thanks also to those that will came after me, not \n\nbecause I will \u201cquit\u201d (not at all!) but because they will become interested on what I have \n\nmade. \n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank my supervisors, Jo\u00e3o Coutinho, Isabel Marrucho, \n\nErling H. Stenby and Georgios M. Kontogeorgis for believing that I could reach this point. \n\nEspecially to Jo\u00e3o Coutinho I would like to acknowledge all the trust he has put on an \n\nIndustrial Chemist with a tiny knowledge of chemical engineering thermodynamics. He \n\nintroduced me to the world of thermodynamics (that\u2019s a real world, there are still many \n\nplaces on it, which I haven\u2019t yet visited!), but not just that! In fact I have learned not only \n\nwith Jo\u00e3o but with all of my supervisors many things that are not thermodynamics  \n\n(ok, some can be, it depends on the point of view). I\u2019m especially thankful to Georgios \n\nKontogeorgis, whom although not on the official supervisor list was always there when I \n\nneeded. \n\nI would like to thank my parents for all the support. They understood that someday I \n\nwould have to leave from a small village on the north of Beira Alta, and continue my \n\nstudies. I hope that now all the effort they made was compensated. I would like to \n\nespecially thank them for the good education they gave me and the humility lessons. \n\nMany thanks are also due to my friends at IVC-SEP and at the Chemistry Department \n\nof the Aveiro University. Particularly I would like to thank those people that have been \n\nmore close to me during the last years, Ana Dias, Ana Isabel Ca\u00e7o, Nuno Pedrosa, Mara \n\nFreire, Nelson Oliveira, Maria Jorge Melo, Lara Rolo, Filipa Silva, Carlos Costa. Some of \n\n\n\nAcknowledgments \n\n- 184 - \n\nthem performed some experimental measurements for me, and for those I\u2019m especially \n\ngrateful. Yolanda Lobato and Nuria Reyes are also acknowledged for collecting and \n\ntreating thermal conductivity and speed of sound data. \n\nI will always remember some persons that I met during my stays in Denmark: \n\nAnnelise Kofod was like a mother for me, and I believe that all those that have been at \n\nIVC-SEP may think the same. She was always there, ready for writing me one more letter \n\nor helping me find one more room to rent. Acknowledgments are also extended to Anne \n\nLouise Biede. The technical staff at IVC-SEP was especially helpful. All the problems that \n\nI had there were solved very efficiently, so that I only had to concentrate myself on the \n\nwork I was doing. Special thanks are due to Dang Thuong, Zacarias Tecle, Povl Valdemar \n\nAndersen and Christian Carlsson. \n\nI would like to make a special reference to Samer O. Derawi and Jan Addicks. The \n\nfirst shared the office with me during my first stay in Denmark and helped my with the \n\nCPA EOS while the second shared his flat with me for some time after I was put out my \n\nrented room in 2001. Fortunately, during my following stay in Denmark I was living with a \n\nvery nice old woman, Ulla Schmidl. With her I discussed a lot about classical music, \n\npolitics, education etc. She also introduced me to snail hunting. \n\nStill, on the IVC-SEP staff I should acknowledge S\u00e9rgio Qu\u00ed\u00f1ones-Cisneros for the \n\nhelp with the friction theory model. \n\nDuring my stays in Denmark I also met Annette and Jos\u00e9 Barreto. To them I should \n\nthank all the dinners they offered me, and the nice evenings we spent together at their \n\nhome. \n\nDuring my short stay at Pau, France, I am especially grateful to Christelle Miqueu. \n\nFrom that time Christelle have been helping me in incorporating the CPA EOS in the \n\ngradient theory framework. Still in Pau, I must acknowledge Christophe Dauphin for the \n\nGC measurements on the petroleum distillation cuts. \n\nBack to Portugal, Luis Belchior Santos is acknowledged for performing the calibration \n\nof our Pt 100 temperature probe and allowing us to use of the Setaram differential scanning \n\ncalorimeter available at his lab in Porto University. \n\n\n\nAcknowledgments \n\n- 185 - \n\nFurther acknowledgments are due to Frank Grunfeld, from NIMA Technology Ltd. for \n\nanswering all my questions, Ascenci\u00f3n Romero-Martinez from the Mexican Petroleum \n\nInstitute for providing me with some vapor-liquid interfacial tension data and Jorge Ribeiro \n\nand Petrogal for providing the distillation cuts. \n\nI shall also acknowledge some financial support which made the evolution of this \n\nthesis possible. To Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia (BD/954/2000) my special \n\nthanks. Without their support I wouldn\u2019t be able to carry out all this work. To Funda\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nLuso-Americana para o Desenvolvimento and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Calouste Gulbenkian I should \n\nthank two conference scholarships that allowed me to present some of my results on \n\ninternational meetings. \n\nFinally I should recognize all the support I got from my family. To Vera I owe several \n\ndays of absence. For all the time that you were alone, while I was in Denmark, France or \n\nanywhere in the world. I should especially apologize for the last few months, while I was \n\nwriting this thesis and you were taking care of Eduardo. To Eduardo I should apologize for \n\nmy absence. I hope that in the future you will not start looking for your father each time \n\nyou pass close to computer, as you were doing in the last months."}]}}}
