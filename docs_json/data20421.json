Both \n\ncountries are actively competing for Africa's natural resources, for markets and for \n\npolitical influence, using several strategies and tactics to ensure and expand their \n\ninterests. This dissertation aims to analyse the main actions and reactions taken by the \n\nU.S. in Africa, regarding China's presence on the continent. It examines the two \n\ncountries cooperation policy and their interests in Africa as well as the measures that \n\nhave been taken by the U.S. to strengthen its strategic policy in Africa. It concludes that, \n\neven though the U.S. is using diplomatic, military and economic instruments to counter \n\nChina's influence on the continent, it doesn't intend to attack China directly. Instead, the \n\nU.S. is employing a \"smart power\" policy characterized by cautiousness.     \t\n \u00a0\n\n \nKeywords: U.S.; China; Africa; Third Scramble; Smart Power; Strategic Interests; \nAFRICOM; Oil; \n\n\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n \n\n \n\nA \u00c1frica tornou-se mais recentemente uma regi\u00e3o de grande import\u00e2ncia estrat\u00e9gica \n\npara os EUA e a China, resultando, na vis\u00e3o de alguns autores, numa nova corrida pela \n\n\u00c1frica. Ambos os pa\u00edses est\u00e3o activamente a competir por recursos naturais, por \n\nmercados econ\u00f3micos e por influ\u00eancia pol\u00edtica, no continente Africano, utilizando \n\nv\u00e1rias estrat\u00e9gias para assegurar e expandir os seus interesses.

A disserta\u00e7\u00e3o analisa a pol\u00edtica de coopera\u00e7\u00e3o dos dois pa\u00edses e os seus \n\ninteresses no continente, bem como as medidas tomadas pelos EUA para refor\u00e7ar a sua \n\npol\u00edtica estrat\u00e9gica no continente, como resposta  \u00e0s ac\u00e7\u00f5es desenvolvidas pela China. A \n\npartir da analise realizada pode-se concluir que, apesar dos EUA utilizarem v\u00e1rios \n\ninstrumentos diplom\u00e1ticos, militares e econ\u00f3micos para conter a influ\u00eancia da China no \n\ncontinente, a inten\u00e7\u00e3o de Washington n\u00e3o \u00e9 atacar a China directamente.

What\u2019s more, the opponent, as with the ex-USSR, is \n\nanother communist state: China. \n\nThe key reason for Africa\u2019s growing importance on the international scene is quite \n\nobvious: Africa is home to some of the largest deposits of natural resources in the \n\nworld, from rare metals, rare earth, non-ferrous and ferrous metals, to fossil fuel such as \n\noil and gas.1 Its impressive natural heritage has been the main reason for what some \n\nhave called The Third Scramble for Africa - \u201ccompetition for control of strategic \n\nresources\u201d (YI-CHONG, 2008.p16) - with China, the U.S. and the European countries \n\nactively competing against each other for Africa\u2019s natural resources, for markets and for \n\npolitical influence. \n\nThe increasing presence of China in Africa has drawn a lot of controversy and strong \n\ncriticism among some Western countries2, which perceive Chinese foreign policy for \n\nAfrica as a growing threat to their own interests. It is increasingly evident that Chinese \n\neconomic involvement in several African countries has forced the traditional African \n\npartners, particularly Europe and the U.S., to reassess its strategic political cooperation \n\nwith the continent.\t\n \u00a0Therefore, taking into account China's influence on the continent, in \n\nrecent years the U.S. has shown a growing interest in Africa in order to ensure access to \n\nenergy resources, gain a geostrategic position and political influence in African \n\ncountries, using several strategies and tactics to achieve its objectives. \t\n \u00a0\n\nThis dissertation seeks to provide a basis for reflection and discussion regarding the \n\nmain actions and reactions taken by the U.S. in Africa, regarding China's presence on \n\nthe continent. More significantly, it aims to answer the following question: Has Chinese \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n1 Figure No.1 and No.2 \n2\t\n \u00a0About the myths of China\u2019s presence in Africa see BRAUTINGAM, (2009)\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n2\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\npresence in Africa prompted an increase in American involvement on the continent, and \n\nif so, in what way?  \n\nBesides this, there are a set of other objectives to support this overall aim: (i) to \n\nunderstand the U.S. and China cooperation policy and their interests in Africa, (ii) to \n\nanalyse how the \"soft power\" policy employed by China undermines the U.S. strategic \n\nplans in Africa; (iii) to examine what measures have been taken to strengthen the U.S. \n\nstrategic policy in Africa as a response to China\u2019s presence in Africa and comprehend if \n\nthere is an action - reaction effect. These objectives will help to test the central \n\nhypothesis: China is one of the main reasons that led the U.S. to engage with key \n\nAfrican countries over securing its strategic interests, controlling China\u2019s growing \n\ninternational stature on the continent.\t\n \u00a0\n\nIn terms of methodology, this study will follow the deductive approach based on the \n\nobservation of empirical reality, taking into account a variety of disciplines such as \n\nHistory, Geopolitics, Political Science, International Relations and Economics.  \n\nThe dissertation is divided into four chapters: the paper begins by exploring the \n\ntheoretical basis for the research topic presented here, based on the theory of IR. The \n\nsecond chapter examines the U.S.\u2019s foreign policy towards Africa and its interests on \n\nthe continent. Chapter three describes the Chinese foreign policy and geo-economic \n\nstrategy for the continent, exploring at the same time its interests in Africa. Chapter four \n\naddresses the implications of China's initiatives for the U.S. foreign policy in Africa. \n\nThe chapter will also discuss various U.S. political, economic and military/security \n\nreactions to China's presence in Africa. Finally, the dissertation presents the main \n\nconclusions arising from the work and suggests some topics for future research. \n\nIt should also be noted that the research topic presented here, which has raised a number \n\nof political, economic, and geostrategic questions among academics, politicians, \n\nanalysts and observers, is also an important issue for the international balance of power \n\nwhose implications are still far from known. \t\n \u00a0\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that the dissertation is not exempt from \n\nimperfections and criticism, nor can it be seen as complete. \n\n   \n\n\n\n3\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nCHAPTER\t\n \u00a0I\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n\nTHEORETICAL\t\n \u00a0FRAMEWORK\t\n \u00a0\n\nBy analysing the main paradigms of international relations (IR) theory, this chapter \n\nattempts to provide a relevant framework about the political relations between states and \n\ntheir behaviour in international context. \t\n \u00a0\n\nSince the beginning of International Relations, which is often thought to be marked by \n\nthe Treaty of Westphalia3, many scholars have tried to develop a wide variety of \n\ntheories that could contribute to a better understanding of the international environment.  \n\nTaking into account the great variety of theoretical perspectives, the existence of five \n\nmajor conceptions of IR it is often accepted: realism; idealism/ liberalism; society of \n\nstates; pluralist \u2013 interdependent and neo-Marxism. There are, however, other authors \n\nwho consider other main paradigms.4  \n\nThe idealism approach of IR, that dominated the period between the two World Wars, \n\nunderlies the belief that IR should be governed by certain ethical principles to achieve \n\npeace and harmony between independent entities. The idealists share a common interest \n\nfor peace and for an international balance of power. They believe that international \n\nbehaviour can be ordered through the use of rational mechanisms and legal institutions. \n\nFurthermore, idealists hold that cooperation is the central feature of international \n\nactivity, which can control the warring passions of the states. The revival of \n\nidealism/liberalism thinking about international politics was accelerated by the \n\ndevelopment of neo-liberalism in the 80\u2019s. Neo-liberalism seeks to understand the \n\nbehaviour of states through the institutions. Keohane believes that \"the behaviour of \n\nstates is highly conditioned (but not determined) by the institutions\" (KEOHANE, 1989, \n\np.2). 5  The International Institutions are seen as purely utilitarian, being able to reduce \n\nthe hostile international environment and allowing states to pursue common interests. \n\nRegarding states\u2019 interests, some authors like Joseph Nye, argue that in order to achieve \n\ntheir goals, states should use \u201csoft power\u201d 6 - the ability of a country to persuade others \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n3 According to the international relations theorists the Treaty of Westphalia established the system of \nsovereign states with equal rights and protection from the intrusion of other states. \n4 See for instance EVANS and NEWHAM,(1998); JACKSON and SORENSEN,(2007). Due to the space \nlimitation I decided to focus only on the realism and liberalism approach.  \n5 KEOHANE, Robert, O., (1989), International Institutions and State Power: Essays in International \nRelations Theory, Boulder, Co., Westview Press in CRAVINHO, (2006, p. 223)\t\n \u00a0\n6 The concept of soft power was developed in his book Bound to Lead: The Changing Nature of \nAmerican Power (1990).  \n\n\n\n4\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nto do what it wants without force or coercion and without having to use \u201chard power\u201d \n\nbased on \u201cmilitary intervention, coercive diplomacy, and economic sanctions\u201d (NYE, \n\n1990, p. 166). In Nye\u2019s opinion, sometimes a nation can achieve its goals only \u201cby \n\nemploying the attractiveness of nation\u2019s foreign policy, values and culture\u201d (NYE, \n\n2004). He also argues that because the results of \u201csoft power\u201d are more diffuse and \n\nharder to achieve, states could also use a combination of hard and soft power \u2013 a \n\nsynergy that leads to \u201csmart power\u201d. \u201cPower in the global information age\u201d Nye asserts \n\n\u201cwill include a soft dimension of attraction as well as the hard combinations of \n\ncoercion and inducement\u201d (NYE, 2008, p. 107).  \n\nOn the other hand, the realist theory of IR, introduced mainly by Carr7 and \n\nMorgenthau8, arises in contrast to the idealist school of thought, which, according to the \n\nrealists, failed to understand the international system leading to the Second World War. \n\nThe main premise of realism is that there are fixed rules, which regulate individual and \n\nstate behaviour: states, like man, are by nature self-interested and aggressive and will \n\npursue their interests to the detriment of others. Inspired by Machiavelli (16th century), \n\nbut essentially by Hobbes (17th century)9, realism\u2019s point of departure is that the \n\nstructure of the international system explains the behaviour of states and the aspects of \n\nIR. According to both classical and contemporary realists, the absence of a central \n\nauthority is the essential feature of the contemporary international system. The idea of \n\ninternational anarchy10, is based on Thomas Hobbes concept of state of nature, \n\naccording to which the \u201clife\u201d between all men is a permanent war of \u201call against all\u201d, \n\nsince states will use all their political power to promote their interests and there\u2019s no one \n\nelse that they can depend on but themselves. Furthermore, since states naturally seek to \n\nmaximize their power in order to intimidate the weaker states, the level of mutual \n\nsuspicion is constantly high.11 \t\n \u00a0\n\nThe aggressive intent of states combined with the lack of world government, means that \n\nconflict is an unavoidable and ever-present reality of IR, meaning that we live in - what \n\nAron called - \u201cthe shadow of war\u201d (ARON, 2002, p. 54).

BC).  \n10 Anarchy is seen as formal and it should be understood as order, stability and as a form of regulating the \ninteractions among independent units.  \n11 See also (HOBBES, 1949)\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n5\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nassume that states12 are the central players in the international system, which has its \n\nroots in \u201chuman natures\u201d. According to Morgenthau\u201cpolitical realism believes that \n\npolitics, like society in general, is governed by objective laws that have their roots in \n\nhuman nature\u201d.13 The interaction between the \u201cegoistic passions\u201d and international \n\nanarchy marks the concept of \u201cpower\u201d as the theoretical core of IR. Thus, international \n\npolitics is a game consisting of the use of power and the demand of power (\u201cpower\u201d \n\nbeing the instrument and the goal of participation in the international system). The \n\nassumption behind this premise is that the accumulation of \u201cpower\u201d is the states\u2019 \n\nforemost foreign policy objective. In addition, Morgenthau believes that states have \n\nirreconcilable interests and each seeks to promote its interests in the most convenient \n\nway.14 \t\n \u00a0\n\nClassical realism has been the dominant model of IR during the past six decades. \n\nNevertheless, the classical version has received a lot of critical scrutiny. One of the most \n\nimportant approaches that redesigned the view of classical realism was neo-realism \n\nthought. Neo-realism shares many core assumptions of classical realism; however its \n\ndefenders argue that it is the nature of the anarchic structure that explains the units\u2019 \n\nbehavior. That is, the neo-realists believe that only a systemic theory can explain the \n\nnature of international context (WALTZ, 2002). \n\nThe beginning of neo-realism was marked by Kenneth Waltz\u2019s book A Theory of \n\nInternational Politics (1979). Neo-realism seeks to identify the structure of international \n\nanarchy in order to create explanatory theories of international behavior, considering \n\nmany system-level theories as reductionists. In contrast to classical realism, neo-realists \n\ndismiss the role of human nature, focusing instead on a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach where the \n\n\u201cstructure\u201d of the international system plays the leading role in the relationships \n\nbetween states rather than the nature of the individual (DONNELLY, 2004, p. 24).  \n\nAccording to Waltz, the contemporary system is anarchic and decentralized rather than \n\nhierarchical. Order is not imposed by a supreme authority \u201cbut arises from the \n\ninteractions of formally equal political actor\u201d (DONNELLY, 2004, p. 17). \n\nFurthermore, in anarchic environments in Waltz\u2019s view \u201ceach unit\u2019s incentive is to put \n\nitself in a position to be able to take care of itself since no one else can be counted on to \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n12 Note that states are seen as the dominant and unitary units because they act uniformly in the \ninternational system, and rational because they pursue to protect their national interests.  \n13 (MORGENTHAU and THOMPSON, 1985, p. 4) See also (NIEBUHR, 1932). \n14 See also (CARR, 1981), (NIEBUHR, 1932, pp. 56-76)\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n6\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\ndo so\u201d. 15 The main difference between states is \u201cof capabilities, not function\u201d. Waltz \n\nargues that states differ not so much in what they seek to achieve, but in their \n\ncapabilities to achieve goals that are largely shared. Moreover, in an anarchic order, the \n\nmost important thing is how the states\u2019 capabilities are distributed among themselves, \n\nand how much power a particular state has in relation to others. The desire of each state \n\nto maximize relative power16 constrains each other, resulting in a \u201cbalance of power\u201d. \n\nThis situation gives rise to the \u201csecurity dilemma\u201d 17 which all nations face.   \n\nFurthermore, for neo-realists although material power matters, it is not an end to itself, \n\nbut an instrument. As Zakaria notes, states seek to maximize influence, not power, or to \n\nput it differently \u201cstates seek to maximize opportunities for implementing their \n\npreferences\u201d.18 That is why states should seek to distribute the power between allies to \n\nensure its leadership for longer. Regarding the balance of power, defensive realists \n\nagree that states have every interest in maintaining the existing balance of power that \n\nprovides stability with survival being the main motive of states. Thus, the state\u2019s foreign \n\npolicy should be characterized by \u201ccautiousness, alliance building, and interest-based \n\ninteraction with other states\u201d (KHALID, 2007, p. 46)  \n\nOn the other hand, offensive realists argue that states are not often satisfied with the \n\nsimple balance of power. According to Mearsheimer, \u201ca state's ultimate goal is to be \n\nthe hegemon in the system\".19 Since global hegemony is \u201calmost impossible\u201d, a great \n\npower has two goals: to dominate its region and prevent other powers from dominating \n\nother regions. 20 \n\nConcluding, both classical and contemporary realism are adequate tools to help us \n\nunderstand the state\u2019s behaviour and motivations. Although often considered too \n\nsimplistic and pessimistic, the realism approach provides us a guide on how states \n\nactually try to survive in a world whose nature is unlikely to change.

However, the manner in which these \n\nobjectives were pursued generally remained shaped by U.S. geo-strategic interests \u2013 \n\n\u201ccontaining the Soviet/Communism expansionism on the continent and building \n\nideological affiliations with African countries\u201d (SIMEON, 2010, p. 58).  \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the second term of the Clinton Administration (1997-2001) that Africa \n\nstarted to gain a new significance, \u201ceven if was still seen through the lens of ad hoc \n\nhumanitarianism, rather than in a strategic manner\u201d (LYMAN, 2006).22 The increasing \n\nemphasis on economic links to Africa and its integration into global economy, have \n\nbeen the main principles of Clinton\u2019s foreign policy towards Africa.

Thus, because of moral imperative obligation of \n\nthe U.S., the grants for humanitarian intervention associated with poverty reduction and \n\naid driving, rather than investment, have substantially increased.25 Nevertheless, the \n\nevents of 9/11 led the Bush administration to engage with Africa from a \u201cwar on terror\u201d \n\nperspective, increasing the foreign aid and its military presence in various regions, \n\nespecially in the Sahel and East Africa. However, despite the adoption of a large \n\nnumber of new development programs26 African policy under the Bush administration \n\ncontinued with the failures of previous administrations. The absence of a careful \n\nstrategic vision and lack of coordination between the different agencies prevented the \n\nestablishment of a coherent and articulated policy in the African countries (WALLE, \n\n2009, p. 11). Only by the end of his second term (2004-2009) and due to the potential \n\ngrowing importance of African oil, did Africa become a new strategic importance for \n\nU.S. interests. Coincidently, it was then that the U.S. seemed to finally understand the \n\ngrowing magnitude of Chinese influence in Africa.  \n\nThe mandate of President Obama brought high expectation, even if unrealistic. Early in \n\nhis term, Obama indicated that he planned to develop a set of more comprehensive and \n\neffective policies towards Africa attempting to mix the economic and security interests \n\nin the region with some adjustments to the development agenda.

Currently more than 20% of the U.S.\u2019 \n\nimported oil has its origins in Africa.30 New oil and gas discoveries, especially in West \n\nAfrican countries, such as Nigeria, and Angola, have made the continent more attractive \n\nto the U.S.31 In addition to oil and gas interests, there are many other natural resources \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n27Accra International Conference Center, 2009.

Besides this, the U.S. is also seeking to expand its trade and \n\ninvestments in Africa and this is illustrated, in part by the expansion of total U.S. trade \n\n(imports plus exports) with sub-Saharan-Africa (SSA). Since 2000 U.S.-Africa trade has \n\nincreased 221% growing from $29.4 billion in 2000 to over $94 billion in 2011.32 In the \n\nyear 2000, trade with Africa made up 1,5 % of total U.S. global trade, and Africa\u2019s \n\nshare had grown to 2,6% by 2011 (JONES and WILLIAMS, 2012, p. 8) However, \n\nunlike China, which is engaging with Africa by using economic instruments, the U.S. is \n\nless involved in promoting strong business ties in Africa. In fact, Foreign Direct \n\nInvestment (FDI) has been largely stagnant. SSA countries are relatively minor \n\ndestination of U.S. FDI. Africa, as a whole hosts about 1% of total U.S. FDI33 being \n\nlargely concentrated in mining and extractive industries, which together comprise some \n\n$29 billion of the $54 billion total stock of U.S. FDI in Africa.34   \n\n2.2. Geopolitical Interests  \n\nBeyond the economic interests, the U.S. is increasingly seeking political and diplomatic \n\nsupport of African countries in the UN and WTO willing at the same time to counter \n\nattempts by others to do so. However due to the lack of a comprehensive diplomatic \n\nrepresentation in Africa states,35 the U.S. has had difficulty in getting political support \n\nfrom African governments. The emergence of a proactive Chinese policy in the region, \n\nthe disastrous effects of the Iraq war, and the Bush administration\u2019s rhetorical \n\ncommitment to unilateralism, weakened the U.S.\u2019 reputation in the region (WALLE, \n\n2009, p. 14). Many countries prefer China as a partner, since it does not interfere in the \n\naffairs of other countries. There is also some evidence that by increasing their presence \n\non the African continent, the U.S. is trying to reduce China\u2019s growing international \n\ninfluence, since the U.S. acknowledges China as having the capability to threaten its \n\nglobal dominance and unipolarity (SIMEON, 2010, p. 63).36 \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n32 See figure No.6 \n33 See figure No.7 \n34 See figure No. 8 \n35According to Walle the U.S. diplomatic presence in Africa has declined due to the \u201dworsening \ninstitutional fragmentation in the foreign policy apparatus, contradictions in policy and the decline in the \nstate Department\u2019s institutional capacity\u201d (WALLE, 2009, p.3) \n36 China\u2019s rise has led to\u201d China\u2019s threat theory\u201d according to which it is inconceivable to China to have a \npeaceful rise and will inevitably be a threat to the U.S.  \n\n\n\n11\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n2.3. Geostrategic and security interests  \n\nA number of security issues, especially counterterrorism, became priority in the list of \n\nU.S. interests in Africa. After the bombing of U.S. embassies in Nairobi (Kenya) and \n\nDar es Salam (Tanzania) in 1998 and the attacks of 9/11 the United States realized that \n\nAfrica posed a serious security threat.37 The \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d, based on the idea that \n\nweak states can bring instability to Africa nations and the fear that al-Qaeda-type \n\norganizations could become established in African failed states, has been Washington\u2019s \n\nrhetoric to justify its growing military presence in Africa. The National Security \n\nStrategy of 2002 is an example of these terrorist concerns: \u201cIn Africa promise and \n\nopportunity sit side by side with disease, war and desperate poverty. This threatens both \n\na core value of the United States \u2013 preserving human dignity \u2013 and our strategic \n\npriority \u2013 combating global terror\u201d (THE WHITE HOUSE, 2002). Under these \n\ncircumstances the U.S. considers to have the moral obligation to ensure stability in \n\nAfrica, leading it to install military programs in several countries. In 2007, in an attempt \n\nto find an appropriate response in fighting terrorism, the Bush administration announced \n\nthe creation of AFRICOM38 aimed to protect and defend the national security interests \n\nof the United States by strengthening the defense capabilities of African states in order \n\nto deter and defeat transnational threats and to provide a security environment \n\nconducive to good governance and development.39 More recently, the deployment of \n\napproximately 100 American military personnel to Uganda, to advise military units in \n\ncapturing or killing the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army leader, Joseph Kony, can\u2019t hide the \n\npurpose of containing the spread of terrorism in that region. A key question, for some, is \n\nwhether the response to fight this small radical organization has an ulterior motive to \n\nachieve strategic interests, since this is a region that is becoming a new oil producing \n\nspot.  \n\nAccording to some authors, such as Michael Klare and Daniel Volman, the \n\nestablishment of U.S. military bases in strategic African regions also seeks to help to \n\nensure the access to natural resources and \u201cfight indigenous forces that might threaten \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n37 Pham, Peter, J.

It was after the Second World War that China started to develop a strong \n\npolitical engagement with African countries, providing ambiguous support to the \n\nindependence and liberation movements, in order to affirm itself as the leader of the \n\nNon-Aligned Movement41 and hoping to strengthen international alliances against the \n\ncapitalist West and the revisionist communist Soviet Union.42 Throughout the 1960\u2019s \n\nand 1970\u2019s China provided financial aid, technological assistance, medical support and \n\nscholarships to the African countries.43 However, the aid program was different from \n\nwestern approaches, by being based on bilateral and South\u2013South cooperation (POWER \n\nand MOHAN, 2008, p. 10). \n\nAfter a period of relative neglect during the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s, the turning point was the \n\nbeginning of the century.

China\u2019s aid and economic cooperation differ, from the Traditional \n\nWestern models, both in their content and in the norms of aid practice. China\u2019s policy \n\ntowards Africa is premised on respect for sovereignty and \u201cnon-interference\u201d in national \n\naffairs, which differentiates it from western approaches that inevitably come with \n\nconditions (POWER and MOHAN, 2008, p. 17). Thus, its development assistance and \n\neconomic support are apparently unconditional and does not require the respect for \n\nwestern values of good governance or human rights like the Washington Consensus \n\ndoes. 49  \n\nFurthermore, authors like Chris Patten argue that while the western approach is based \n\non an idealistic view of good intentions, the Chinese paradigm is much more objective, \n\npragmatic, flexible and effective (PATTEN, 2009). While the West determines what \n\nAfrica needs, adopting general plans with little adjustment to demand, Chinese strategy \n\nis based on research providing what local people need, and adopting plans to local \n\nconditions, which \u201cgives it a great deal of credibility as a partner with relevant recent \n\nexperience\u201d.

This relates to the idea that Africa\u2019s resources are important to China\u2019s growth \n\nand that the engagement with Africa is a win-win situation for both parties (ANSHAN, \n\n2006).50 \n\nThis renewed attention towards Africa was driven by a set of strategic interests. Firstly, \n\nlike the U.S., China needs to ensure the access to energy resources, minerals and \n\nagricultural products, which are essential for its economic growth. After the U.S., China \n\nis the second largest oil consumer in the world and the importance of Africa as a top oil \n\nsupplier for China has grown exponentially, as shown by figures No.10 and No.11, with \n\nAngola being at the moment, the main supplier of China\u2019s oil imports.  \n\nSecondly, China seeks to expand its economic relations with Africa. The favorable \n\nconditions with access to the African markets, and in some cases the weaknesses of \n\nsome African states is extremely attractive for China\u2019s economic expansion. China\u2019s \n\neconomic engagement with African countries combines three main elements: aid, trade \n\nand investment. Chinese aid, which consists of grants, zero-interests loans, debt relief \n\nand concessional loans, is mostly perceived as development projects to produce quick \n\nand tangible results, which enable China to gain political influence in African \n\ncountries.51  \n\nNevertheless, it is the trade transactions between China and Africa that provide the most \n\npowerful evidence of China\u2019s emerging economic interests on the continent. Chinese-\n\nAfrican trade has grown rapidly since 2000, reaching $160 billion in 2011 from just $9 \n\nbillion in 2000, surpassing the U.S.52 China\u2019s share in Africa\u2019s total trade has also been \n\nextraordinary, increasing to 13% from 3% a decade ago (JONES and WILLIAMS, \n\n2012). Moreover, China\u2019s FDI stock in Africa in 2010 reached more than $13 billion.53 \n\nChina is also Africa\u2019s largest single source of imports, while the U.S. is its largest \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n50 Anshan, L.

The evidence of this is that fossil fuels and raw \n\nmaterials represent roughly 4/5 of Chinese imports originating from Africa and there are \n\naround ten African countries which account for 76% of all trade relations with China.55 \n\nMoreover, the financial support from Chinese banks, including China Export-Import \n\nBank has had a vital role in strengthening its economic relations with Africa. It provides \n\nloans to governments and supports Chinese companies, which are normally state-\n\nowned, to invest in Africa through export credits, loans for overseas projects and \n\ninternational guarantees.56 Furthermore, in order to take full advantage of the Sino-\n\nAfrican cooperation, China has also established commercial and investment hubs called \n\nSpecial Economic Zones (SEZ), \"which provide \u201cinfrastructure corridors\u201d that link \n\nAfrican producers and markets in China\" (SHINN and EISENMAN, 2008, p. 5). Its \n\nlow interest loans and its funding mechanism of exchange, known as the Angola \n\nMode,57 have received strong criticisms among American officials, who argue that by \n\npursuing this policy China allows countries to escape IMF and World Bank58 \n\nregulations and also restricts the access of U.S. companies in Africa. \n\nThirdly, China seeks to become a major international player promoting a multi-polar \n\nworld, in contrast to the American \u201cbipolar system\u201d (XU YI-CHONG, 2008), and at the \n\nsame time wants to develop good relationships with all African countries to gain \n\npolitical support in regional and international forums. And lastly, China is seeking to \n\nend Taiwan\u2019s international recognition and replacing it with the recognition of Beijing. \n\nGenerally speaking, Chinese interests in Africa are both economic and political \n\ninterests.  \n\nConcluding, over the past decade while the U.S. has all too often ignored SSA in its \n\npolicies, Beijing has quietly established relationships with the continent\u2019s political and \n\nbusiness elites.

The analysis of these parameters will be based on three main dimensions: \n\neconomic, security and political. So far, it seems that the United States doesn\u2019t have an \n\neffective strategy to counter China\u2019s influence in Africa. What can be seen is rather an \n\nassembled set of measures aimed to limit China\u2019s dominance. Moreover, U.S.-China \n\ninteraction on the continent can be viewed as an action-reaction sequence.60  \n\n1.\t\n \u00a0ECONOMIC\t\n \u00a0DIMENSION\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n\nThe Chinese initiatives and economic successes discussed in the previous chapter \n\nhave been followed closely by the U.S. In 2000, the same year that China established \n\nthe FOCAC, the Clinton Administration introduced a comprehensive U.S. trade and \n\ninvestment policy for the African continent - the African Growth and Opportunity Act \n\n(AGOA). Since then, AGOA has been the main economic act to strengthen the U.S.-\n\nAfrica relationship, and the only successful economic response to China in Africa and it \n\nalso has had a predominant role in acquiring oil and natural resources. In fact, energy \n\nresources have dominated the products imported from Africa under AGOA. Since 2000 \n\nexports under AGOA have increased from $8.15 billion in 2001 to $53 billion in \n\n201161, 90% of which have been energy related products.62 Also, during the first term of \n\nthe Bush Administration (2001-2004), the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) \n\n(2004), a multi-billion dollar program which provides assistance for \u201ccompact \n\nagreements\u201d to reduce poverty and stimulate the economic growth, was established.63  \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n60I want to use this term, used mainly in physics, to better illustrate the American-Sino interaction on \nAfrican continent.

As in physics, every \naction in bilateral and multilateral relations (for instance: China\u2019s relation with African countries) can \nproduce a response from the political elite of another country which is pursuing similar interests (in this \ncase the U.S.) which is pursuing similar interests.\t\n \u00a0\n61 See figure No. 16\t\n \u00a0\n62 See figure No.17.

Like his predecessors G.W.Bush and Bill \n\nClinton, Obama has embraced AGOA to demonstrate that the U.S. commitment is more \n\nthan just foreign aid, military ties, and special bilateral deals. It is a partnership in \n\nbuilding the capacity for transformational change. On his official visits to Africa in \n\n2009, Obama has clearly expressed his wish to help African states to develop \n\neconomically and treat them as potential valuable international partners. Furthermore, \n\nHillary Clinton also visited Africa in 2011, voicing U.S. desire for sustainable \n\ninvestments in Africa: \u201cWe want a relationship of partnership not patronage, of \n\nsustainability, not quick fixes. We want to establish strong foundation to attract new \n\ninvestment\u201d (SECRETARY OF STATE, 2011). \n\nIt is important to note, the official visits have been a mechanism used by the U.S. \n\nleaders to contribute to a greater U.S. engagement in Africa. However, the number of \n\nU.S. official visits to Africa in contrast with the Chinese has been highly inferior, \n\nshowing once again how different methods drive different foreign policies.64 \t\n \u00a0\n\nAlthough AGOA has contributed to increase US-Africa trade, \u201cthe achievements of \n\nAGOA have by and large been below expectations\u201d (BROOKINGS, 2011, p. 3). In \n\nparticular, it has not contributed to any visible economic transformation of African \n\neconomies and has not been able to stimulate American investments in Africa.65 \n\nMore recently, in an attempt to encourage the U.S. and Africa to do business together, \n\nthe White House has announced a new U.S. Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa.66 In an \n\nattempt to spread the pillars of this new strategy, on July 31st 2012, the Secretary of \n\nState Hillary Clinton embarked on an official journey to several African countries. \n\nApart from strengthening the U.S.\u2013Africa commercial relations, Clinton\u2019s visit has also \n\nbeen interpreted as an attempt to counter China\u2019s influence in Africa. According to \n\nViano, \u201cThe U.S. wants to use this visit as a manoeuvre to limit the influence of China \n\n[\u2026] cautioning African leaders not to strike deals too easily with China\u201d (VIANO, \n\n2012).67 This strategy comes only a few weeks after the Forum on China-Africa \n\nCooperation (FOCAC) in Beijing.

The institutional fragmentation and the lack of coordination between many \n\nAmerican agencies deeply contrasts with the Chinese way of acting, making it difficult \n\nfor the U.S. to achieve concrete economic objectives, especially as China gives African \n\ncountries an alternative way of doing business and more bargaining power. \n\n2.\t\n \u00a0SECURITY\t\n \u00a0AND\t\n \u00a0MILITARY\t\n \u00a0DIMENSION\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n\nApart from economic responses, the U.S. has also been using military initiatives \n\nand tactics, aimed mainly at combating terrorism and containing local threats to try to \n\nsecure the safe flow of natural resources from Africa. The U.S. has used a variety of \n\nsecurity assistance programs and established military bases in Africa to enhance its \n\nmilitary influence68. As a result, the U.S. is now involved directly and indirectly in \n\nmilitary and surveillance operations against an expanding list of regional enemies. They \n\ninclude: al-Qaeda in the Maghreb in North Africa; the Islamist movement Boko Haram \n\nin Nigeria; possible al-Qaeda-linked militants in post-Qaddafi Libya; Mali\u2019s Islamist \n\nrebels of the Ansar Dine, al-Shabaab in Somalia; Joseph Kony Lord\u2019s Resistance Army \n\n(LRA) in the Central African Republic and Uganda; and guerrillas from al-Qaeda in the \n\nArabian Peninsula across the Gulf of Aden in Yemen (TURSE, 2012). However, the \n\nfight against terrorism can be seen as a strategic tactic whose goals go beyond mere \n\n\"war on terrorism\". \n\nMany authors69 argue that at a strategic level by increasing military presence in Africa \n\nthe U.S. may target the access to natural resources and indirectly China\u2019s intensive \n\npresence in Africa. Although empirically it is more difficult to examine this, China is at \n\nleast one of the potential reasons for U.S. military presence in Africa, and the US Africa \n\nCommand (AFRICOM), seen by China as \u201cunpleasant and out of sorts\u201d70, has been the \n\nmain instrument in achieving this goal.

In addition to other goals, such as combating piracy, illegal fishing and \n\nillegal trafficking, the fact remains that oil forms the primary interest and determines the \n\nnature of U.S. policy towards West Africa (and AFRICOM activities)72. In 2011 the \n\nAmbassador J. Anthony Holmes argued that the U.S. wants to \u201censure that the system \n\noperates without disruption\u201d.73 Thus, some authors believe that \u201cU.S. navy ships \n\npatrolling these areas could help reestablish maritime security\u201d (CRUZ and \n\nSTEPHENS, 2010), and enable Washington to secure its strategic interests. On the other \n\nhand, some analysts argue that by expanding its military \u201carsenal\u201d in African waters, the \n\nU.S. Navy is strategically trying to control in the future the transportation of oil and \n\nother minerals from Africa to China.74  \n\nU.S. Officials claim that their increasing military engagement in Africa is a strategic \n\npartnership for cooperation, development and support for fighting terrorism. By \n\nincorporating military and security interests with development, the U.S. aims to \n\nembrace a strategy different than former policy mainly focused on a \u201chard power\u201d \n\npolicy. According to some authors, \u201cAFRICOM could be part of a greater U.S. foreign \n\npolicy strategy for \u201csmart power\u201d in the developing world\u201d in order to win trust among \n\nAfrican countries (CRUZ and STEPHENS, 2010, p. 195). The activities intended to \n\nfight terrorism and provide security could be classified as \u2018hard power\u2019, whereas other \n\nprograms, such as military training and education programs, and humanitarian projects, \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n71 Cited in (WILLIAM, 2008)  \n72 See also (KLARE and VOLMAN, 2006) \n73 (US AFRICOM Public Affairs, 2011)  \n74 See for instance Michael Klare (2008), Rising Powers, Shrinking Planet: The New Geopolitics of \nEnergy, A Holt Paperback, New York,  \n\n\n\n22\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nare intended to build \u2018soft power\u2019. As Nye observes, \u201cthe military can sometimes play \n\nan important role in the generation of soft power\u201d (NYE, 2008, p. 106). However, the \n\nAFRICOM military programs don\u2019t seem to generate soft power, since suspicions and \n\nskepticism has been raised regarding its main motives, making it harder to find partners \n\nfor the implementation of the program.75  The diminished credibility of American policy \n\nas a result of the Iraq war, as well as the incapacity of the Department of Defense in \n\nadequately explaining how the command will help African countries, aroused a fear that \n\nthe U.S. was militarizing its foreign policy in Africa.76 As Michelle Ruiters, a senior \n\nresearcher at the Institute for Global Dialogue puts it \u201cAFRICOM would destabilize an \n\nalready fragile continent and region, which would be forced to engage with U.S. \n\ninterests on military matters\u201d. 77 China, on the other hand, at the moment does not use \n\nmilitary pressure to achieve agreements with African countries; it uses a \u201csoft power\u201d \n\npolicy based on flexibility, consistency and pragmatism, which in turn provides \n\ntransparency, legitimacy, accountability, visibility and recognition among African \n\ncountries. \n\nIn spite of the attempts of U.S. efforts in projecting a soft power message, its military \n\npresence in Africa is still questionable.  \n\n \n3.\t\n \u00a0POLITICAL\t\n \u00a0DIMENSION\t\n \u00a0\n\nIn order to better understand U.S. actions in Africa, it is important to acknowledge \n\nthe rivalry between the U.S. and China in the international context. Since the late 80\u2019s, \n\nChina\u2019s rise has being viewed with uncertainty and anxiousness in the U.S. Its rapid \n\neconomic growth, its rising power and influence in the world, \u201craised the specter of a \n\nnew global rivalry for power and influence (FRIEDBERG, 2005, p. 7). The U.S. \n\nprevalent debate has focused on two main schools of thoughts: liberalism - essentially \n\noptimistic - and realism - distinctly pessimistic. The main opinion in the U.S. is that a \n\nrising China has reshaped the existing global order and challenged the global leadership \n\nof the U.S. (ZHOU, 2011, p. 626). American pessimists from the realist school argue \n\nthat China possesses a \u201cbig challenge\u201d78 for the U.S. and a great power rivalry between \n\nChina and the U.S. is inevitable.

Liberal authors consider that \n\nthe expansion of China\u2019s involvement in the international institutions will promote \n\ncommunication and mutual understanding, reducing at the same time the prospects for \n\nconflict. 80  \n\nThese two main visions have also influenced the debate on China\u2019s engagement in \n\nAfrica. There are four key concerns that dominate U.S. discussions with respect to the \n\nChinese presence in Africa. The first major concern is defended by the realist followers \n\nwho argue that the growing Chinese interest in Africa will directly affect the U.S. \n\ninterests in ensuring access to African oil. According to BROOKES and SHIN (2006), \n\nChinese investment in the African oil sector is a way of deliberately blocking the \n\nsupplies to importing countries and keeping the U.S. out of African markets, advocating \n\nthat the only way to ensure U.S. interests in Africa is through increased economic and \n\nmilitary presence on the continent. \t\n \u00a0\n\nThe second concern is focused on structural aspects regarding how China conducts \n\nbusiness in Africa - calling into question the fundamental values of the West, \n\nparticularly human rights, transparency and good governance practices.81 Some authors \n\nfear that its strong sense of autonomy, independence, and no strings attached policy can \n\neasily cease the long efforts of the U.S. to \"improve\" the African regimes regarding \n\ntheir transparency, governance and corruption. \n\nFurthermore, another realist perspective argues that Chinese expansion in Africa is part \n\nof an overall strategy to challenge U.S. leadership in the world. According to this \n\nvision, China\u2019s growing economic and strategic power contributes to a major change in \n\nthe balance of power over strategic and economic influence on the African continent, \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n79 See LAYNE C. 1993, \u201cThe unipolar illusion: why new great powers will rise\u201d, International Security 17, \n4; BRZEZINSKI Z. and MEARSHEIMER John J., 2005, \u201cClash of titans\u201d, Foreign Policy;\t\n \u00a0\n80About the effect of China\u2019s participation in international institutions see OKSENBERG M. and ECONOMY, \nE. eds., (1999), \u201cChina Joins the World: Progress and Prospects\u201d, Council on Foreign Relations; \t\n \u00a0\n81About this vision see also  (HILSUM, 2005, pp. 18-19) \n\n\n\n24\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nwhich can bring a high potential for conflict and a change in terms of world \n\nleadership.82 \n\n Finally, a more liberal and optimistic view, seeking to calm \"the spirits\", claims that \n\n\u2018\u2018the current state of China-Africa links is not a significant foreign policy threat to \n\nAmerica\u2019s interest in Africa\u201d (YI-CHONG, 2008). According to this latter view, \n\nChina\u2019s engagement in Africa should be seen as an opportunity for the U.S. since there \n\nare many areas for cooperation between the two countries.83  \n\nBy analyzing these political views, it is possible to see that the U.S. is also using \n\npolitical strategies as a response to China\u2019s activities in Africa. Although U.S. officials \n\ndo not mention any country by name, often their remarks in official visits and speeches \n\ncan be interpreted as a swipe at China. Hillary Clinton in her visit to Africa in 2011 \n\nmentioned \u201cIt is easy to come in, take out natural resources, pay off leaders and leave.\u201d \n\nMoreover, she characterized China as a new imperialist power in Africa stating that, \n\n\u201cAfrica must beware of \u201cnew colonialism\u201d as China expands ties there and focus \n\ninstead on partners able to help build proactive capacity on the continent\u201d.  \n\nFurthermore, the Chinese separation of business interests from political concerns is seen \n\nby the Americans as an obstacle to African democratization. U.S. officials warn that \n\nChina\u2019s support for dictatorial regimes undermines development initiatives on the \n\ncontinent. U.S. officials aim to convince the Africans that economic progress is possible \n\neven with high standards for human rights, democracy and good governance. Winning \n\nthe hearts of the people and African officials by convincing them that America is a force \n\nof \u201cgood\u201d which offers stability and security, has been the key play of the Obama \n\nadministration. Nevertheless, the projection of good governance and democracy is \n\nsometimes called into question, especially when energy and security interests are at \n\nstake. The U.S. relationship with African dictatorial regimes, rich in natural resources, \n\nis important to U.S. energy and security, and has been recognized by Obama, as he \n\nmentioned that,\u201cour security interests will sometimes require that we work with regimes \n\nwith which we have fundamental disagreements\u201d.84 The U.S. may often support oil rich \n\ncountries that may have bad human rights and good governance records as long as they \n\n\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0 \t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\t\n \u00a0\n82 See for instance Bernstein and Munro, (1997), \u201cThe coming Conflict with America\u201d, Foreign Affairs, \nVol. 76, No.2. \n83 See for instance Wilson III, E.

Both countries have been very active on the African continent, \n\nbut always cautious in their speeches and in diplomatic and political initiatives. In \n\nreality the two pursue their interests always \u201cunder the veil of moral superiority\u201d (YI-\n\nCHONG, 2008, p. 15). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\n\n26\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nCONCLUSION\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\nBefore moving to the conclusions drawn from this dissertation, let\u2019s recall the \n\ncentral research question: Has Chinese presence in Africa prompted an increase in \n\nAmerican involvement in the continent, and if so, in what way?  \n\nFirst of all, it\u2019s important to note that the competition for Africa is not recent, quite the \n\ncontrary. Currently the \"new scramble\" for is taking place among the world's big powers \n\nand emerging countries, which are competing for commercial, political and geostrategic \n\ninterests. Both China and the U.S. are using all their political and diplomatic efforts to \n\nensure their interests on the continent.  \n\nSecondly, it is evident that since 2000, the U.S. - which comparing with other countries \n\nhas never had a huge involvement and interest in Africa - has been increasing its \n\npresence on the continent, resulting in a competition with China. The analysis of various \n\nfactors made throughout this research leads us to conclude that the U.S. involvement in \n\nAfrican is largely due to the prominent presence of China on the continent. However, it \n\nwould be a mistake to conclude that this is the only reason. Although there is a positive \n\ncorrelation between the two variables, the fast-growing U.S. presence in Africa can also \n\nbe associated to a number of strategic interests important for the U.S. Economically, \n\nAfrica is an increasingly important supplier of natural resources and a region with great \n\ninvestment and business opportunities. Besides this, the U.S. is seeking political support \n\nfrom African countries and has shown a great concern for security issues and instability \n\non the continent, taking actions to combat terrorism and maintain security.  \n\nThirdly, although, the U.S. doesn\u2019t have a clear and proactive strategy for China\u2019s \n\npresence in Africa, there is an increase need to counter its [China] influence on the \n\ncontinent. By doing that the U.S. is intending to increase its diplomatic, military and \n\neconomic influence throughout Africa, which will give Washington a better position to \n\ngain, for the first time, political dominance in the region, to ensure the access to natural \n\nresources and to expand its military actions against the \u201cwar on terror\u201d.  \n\nThe competition to achieve these strategic objectives emanates from the nature of this \n\nrivalry as well as the structure of the present international system. In this sense one can \n\n\n\n27\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nconclude that the subject of the study discussed in this dissertation follows the \n\ntheoretical realist approach initially mentioned, whereby both the U.S. and China will \n\ntry to gain a position where they can use all their power to promote their interests, since \n\nthere is no one else that they can count on. In effect both countries are trying to gain \n\nrelative power by different forms. On one hand, China is using its \u201csoft power\u201d policy \n\nbased on non-interference into the internal affairs of a nation and no strings attached \n\napproach, which gives China a marked advantage over the U.S. in their interaction with \n\nAfrica. On the other hand, to counter China\u2019s influence and ensure its strategic interests, \n\nthe U.S. has been using diplomatic, military and economic instruments to strengthen \n\npartnerships with its new allies and \u201cfriends\u201d and increase its military capabilities on the \n\ncontinent; develop new economic initiatives with certain countries. These initiatives \n\nhighlight the action-reaction effect, which I believe to be the main characteristic of \n\nAmerican -Sino competition on the continent. Furthermore, I can also conclude that the \n\nAmerican actions have been developed under a political strategy that can be summed up \n\nas \"follow my words, not my deeds\u201d. This means that, while the U.S. is using all its \n\neconomic and military initiatives, it is clear that it doesn\u2019t intend to attack China \n\ndirectly, being cautious on their official speeches for fears of losing the support of \n\nAfrican countries.    Above all, the U.S. intends to use its values of democracy, respect \n\nfor human right and good governance, sometimes under an almost ideological \n\ndiscourse, to encourage Africa to move away from China, showing that while China is \n\nabove all interested in Africa\u2019s resources, the U.S. is concerned with the Africa\u2019s \n\neconomic, political and democratic progress.\t\n \u00a0 \n\nThe basic morality and the return of soft power seem to shape the resources scramble in \n\nAfrica. The instruments of power used by the Obama administration can be identify as \n\nbeing part from a \u201csmart power\u201d strategy, which has become the core principle of \n\nObama\u2019s foreign policy in Africa, but also in the world. When analyzing the American- \n\nSino competition from a global perspective, one can say that the \u201csmart power\u201d policy \n\nis the recognition of the \u201crelativization\u201d of the American Power and the fact that, in \n\nNye\u2019s phrase, \u201cthe U.S. can\u2019t go alone\u201d.  Theoretically speaking I would say that this \n\ncompetition represents a combination of neoliberalism and defensive realism, \n\ncharacterized by cautiousness, cooperation, and alliance-building. \n\nIs this political strategy a new way of engaging the competition for natural resources in \n\nAfrica? Is Africa a testing ground for both powers to decide their global position? \n\nAlthough there is too early to know the answers to these questions, the truth is that, \n\n\n\n28\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\nChina's interest in Africa caused a sort of alert among Western powers and African \n\ntraditional partners, and this dissertation is the proof of that.  \n\nThis dissertation covers only a few main aspects of the American-Sino rivalry. \n\nHopefully, however, it has managed to set the ground for further research on this matter. \n\nTherefore it is recommended that further studies be conducted in the following areas: \n\nunderstand the impact of the competition on stability in Africa; comprehend how \n\ncompetition for strategic interests in Africa is reshaping the global, political, and \n\neconomic order; further research is need to determine the real dimension of the U.S. \n\nmilitary involvement in Africa, and how this is affecting China\u2019s activity in Africa; and \n\nwhether or not this competition could precipitate conflicts among major power.   \n\n      \n\n \n\n\n\n29\t\n \u00a0\n\t\n \u00a0\n\n \n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\t\n \u00a0\n \n\nALDEN, C.
