These lavas have been extensively studied in the United States and Morocco, however little \n\nattention has been given to the CAMP lavas from the south of Portugal for which geochemical data \n\nhave been recently published. Paleomagnetic methods can play a key role in the paleogeographic \n\nreconstruction of CAMP lavas at a global scale, and also be useful for geochronological purposes. \n\nHere I present a detailed rock- and paleo-magnetic study of the Portuguese CAMP lavas from the \n\nAlgarve basin\u2019s outcrops. It is showed that, despite severe superficial alteration, rocks preserved their \n\nprimary magnetic mineralogy represented by an assemblage of fine titanomagnetite as the dominant \n\ncarriers of the NRM. After cleaning by alternating field, a characteristic remanent magnetization \n\n(ChRM) is isolated at Dec=353.4\u00ba, Inc=52.8\u00ba (a95=1.5\u00ba, N=257) and Dec=0\u00ba, Inc=50.4\u00ba (a95=8.3\u00ba, \n\nN=8) for sample and site-based mean respectively. The results yielded a statistically well-defined pole \n\nat: Plat=83.3\u00ba and Plong=236.1\u00ba (A95=1.8\u00ba) and Plat=84.4\u00ba and Plong=177.9\u00ba (A95=9.8\u00ba) for sample \n\nand site-based paleomagnetic pole, respectively. Position of the corresponding paleomagnetic pole is \n\nsignificantly different from the referenced Messejana dyke\u2019s pole. This discrepancy is due to the \n\npresence of two VGP\u2019s. One of the VGP\u2019s group (component A) falls within the Messejana VGP\u2019s \n\ndistributions whereas the other has no equivalent with other younger pole. We show the enigmatic \n\ndirection of component B is not product of remagnetization, lightning or difference in age. We suggest \n\nsignificant tectonic movements in the Algarve\u2019s basin as a potential cause. On a magnetostratigraphic \n\npoint of view, all lavas carry a normal (positive) magnetization confirming the previous results that \n\ndemonstrated the absence of the well-known E23r reverse anomaly in Morocco. VGP\u2019s directions per \n\nflow vary slightly within the lava pile suggesting rapid eruptions. \n\n \n\nKey-Words: CAMP, lavas, paleomagnetism, magnetic mineralogy, Iberia. \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\nResumo expandido \n\nA Prov\u00edncia Magm\u00e1tica do Atl\u00e2ntico Central (CAMP) \u00e9 considerada uma das maiores prov\u00edncias \n\n\u00edgneas do Faneroz\u00f3ico e \u00e9 contempor\u00e2nea da crise biol\u00f3gica que marca a transi\u00e7\u00e3o Tri\u00e1ssico-Jur\u00e1ssico \n\n(Tr-J) (~200 Ma). Vest\u00edgios desta prov\u00edncia s\u00e3o encontrados em quatro continentes com uma \u00e1rea que \n\nexcede os 100 milh\u00f5es de km2, o que leva muitos cientistas a acreditar que a crise biol\u00f3gica que marca \n\neste per\u00edodo \u00e9 provocada pela erup\u00e7\u00e3o desta prov\u00edncia magm\u00e1tica. Neste sentido, as lavas da CAMP \n\nt\u00eam sido extensivamente estudadas, especialmente nos Estados Unidos e em Marrocos, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 para \n\nperceber o seu sincronismo com a crise biol\u00f3gica, mas tamb\u00e9m para estudos de paleoreconstitui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nusando m\u00e9todos paleomagneticos.  \n\nEm Portugal as evid\u00eancias da CAMP s\u00e3o representadas por um dique de cerca de 540 Km de extens\u00e3o, \n\no dique da Messejana, e por afloramentos de lavas continentais distribu\u00eddos ao longo das bacias do \n\nAlgarve e de Santiago do Cac\u00e9m. A import\u00e2ncia do estudo destas lavas recai sobretudo na necessidade \n\nde calcular novos polos paleomagneticos para reconstituir a paleogeografia da placa Ib\u00e9rica \u00e0 200 Ma, \n\nque ainda hoje \u00e9 um assunto discutido. O problema principal destas reconstitui\u00e7\u00f5es paleogeogr\u00e1ficas \n\nreside na escassez de dados paleomagneticos de qualidade. De facto, o \u00fanico polo paleomagnetico \n\npara a Ib\u00e9ria \u00e0 200 Ma \u00e9 o polo da Messejana que servir\u00e1 de refer\u00eancia para o presente estudo. \n\nA descoberta da anomalia E23r imediatamente abaixo do limite Tri\u00e1ssico-Jur\u00e1ssico na bacia de \n\nNewark, Estados Unidos, e posteriormente sugerido nas lavas da CAMP em Marrocos, tem sido \n\ntamb\u00e9m um assunto bastante debatido uma vez que a presen\u00e7a desta anomalia nas lavas da CAMP \u00e9 \n\nusada como marcador temporal. Em Newark, esta anomalia encontra-se abaixo do limite Tr-J e das \n\nlavas da CAMP. Em Marrocos, foi sugerida a presen\u00e7a desta anomalia E23r no meio da sequ\u00eancia \n\nbas\u00e1ltica levando \u00e0 conclus\u00e3o que a CAMP em Marrocos \u00e9 mais antiga que em Newark e anterior ao \n\nlimite Tr-J. Por\u00e9m, os resultados que foram adquiridos no meu projecto de licenciatura demonstraram \n\nque a invers\u00e3o geomagn\u00e9tica encontrada nas lavas em Marrocos era na realidade um artefacto \n\nresultante de uma remagnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica. A eventual presen\u00e7a de anomalias inversas nos basaltos \n\nprecisa de ser verificada em Portugal. \n\nO prop\u00f3sito principal deste trabalho \u00e9 i) obter um novo polo paleomagnetico para a placa Ib\u00e9rica aos \n\n200 Ma e ii) verificar a presen\u00e7a da anomalia E23r em Portugal. Devido \u00e0 forte altera\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica que \n\nafecta a maioria dos afloramentos da regi\u00e3o do Algarve, um estudo preliminar da mineralogia \n\nmagn\u00e9tica torna-se indispens\u00e1vel. \n\nA amostragem de campo consistiu em tr\u00eas excurs\u00f5es de cinco dias cada, financiadas pelo projecto \n\nFCT (IMPACTO; ref. PTDC/CTE-GIX/117298/2010). Mais de 300 amostras foram recolhidas desde \n\na extremidade oeste da bacia do Algarve at\u00e9 \u00e0 fronteira com Espanha. Foram privilegiados s\u00edtios de \n\namostragem onde dados geoqu\u00edmicos foram recentemente publicados. \n\nA parte experimental do trabalho foi dividida em duas partes: 1. Magnetismo de rocha e 2. \n\nPaleomagnetismo. O magnetismo de rocha permite a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o do tipo, natureza e tamanho de \n\ngr\u00e3os dos minerais portadores da magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o natural remanescente da rocha. Para isto, os principais \n\nm\u00e9todos usados foram: Magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o remanescente isot\u00e9rmica (IRM) que informa sobre a \n\ncoercividade dos minerais ferromagn\u00e9ticos presentes na amostra; Curvas termomagn\u00e9ticas que \n\nidentificam os minerais magn\u00e9ticos presentes a partir da determina\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura de Curie (N\u00e9el); \n\nDay-Plot e FORC\u2019s usados na identifica\u00e7\u00e3o do tamanho de gr\u00e3o e coercividade dos principais \n\nportadores magn\u00e9ticos. \n\nA sec\u00e7\u00e3o do Paleomagnetismo, baseou se essencialmente na desmagnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o usando campo alternado \n\npara calcular as direc\u00e7\u00f5es das componentes magn\u00e9ticas presentes nas rochas. As componentes \n\nmagn\u00e9ticas s\u00e3o calculadas com base no m\u00e9todo de an\u00e1lise das componentes principais (ACP) usando a \n\nestat\u00edstica de Fisher que controla a qualidade das componentes calculadas. Posteriormente, o polo \n\npaleomagnetico calculado \u00e9 qualitativamente avaliado usando o factor Q dos crit\u00e9rios de Van Der \n\nVoo. \n\nOs resultados mostram que apesar da forte oxida\u00e7\u00e3o que afecta a maioria das amostras da bacia do \n\nAlgarve a magnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o remanescente \u00e9 est\u00e1vel e \u00e9 essencialmente portada por titanomagnetites. Estes \n\nresultados s\u00e3o inferidos pela an\u00e1lise de curvas termomagn\u00e9ticas que a baixas temperaturas mostram a \n\ncaracter\u00edstica transi\u00e7\u00e3o de Verwey (~-160\u00baC) da magnetite e a altas temperaturas apresentam \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\ntemperaturas de Curie t\u00edpicas da titanomagnetite (entre 200\u00baC e 560\u00baC). A an\u00e1lise das IRM usando o \n\ntratamento de Kruiver revela que para a maioria das amostras existe para al\u00e9m da magnetite, um \n\nmineral mais coercivo que n\u00e3o \u00e9 identificado nas curvas termomagn\u00e9ticas. Este mineral mais coercivo \n\nexiste em pequena propor\u00e7\u00e3o nas amostras e pensa-se ser hematite, mineral comum nos basaltos. Nas \n\ncurvas termomagn\u00e9ticas, um outro mineral \u00e9 identificado aos ~250\u00baC-350\u00baC. Este mineral \u00e9 \n\ninterpretado como sendo maghemite, a fase oxidada da magnetite. A associa\u00e7\u00e3o titanomagnetite, \n\nmaghemite e hematite corresponde \u00e0 mineralogia cl\u00e1ssica de basaltos continentais com algum grau de \n\noxida\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nAs amostras submetidas \u00e0 desmagnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o em campo alternado (AF) mostram padr\u00f5es de \n\ndesmagnetiza\u00e7\u00e3o bastante est\u00e1veis, todas elas com polariza\u00e7\u00e3o normal (positiva) e em geral com \n\ndistribui\u00e7\u00f5es bem agrupadas por s\u00edtio nos estereogramas. Duas componentes foram isoladas: i) uma \n\ncomponente magn\u00e9tica eliminada com campos inferiores a 20 mT e interpretada como sendo uma \n\ncomponente viscosa, adquirida em campo fraco posteriormente \u00e0 forma\u00e7\u00e3o da rocha; ii) Uma \n\ncomponente magn\u00e9tica est\u00e1vel em campos elevados (> 40 mT) com uma direc\u00e7\u00e3o N-NE e inclina\u00e7\u00e3o \n\npositiva.  \n\nDas 280 amostras analisadas, 257 foram usadas para calcular a componente m\u00e9dia das amostras, o que \n\nrepresenta uma percentagem de sucesso ~92%. Os \u201coutliers\u201d foram eliminados usando o m\u00e9todo de \n\nVandamme 1994. A componente magn\u00e9tica m\u00e9dia calculada para todas as amostras, corrigidas pelo \n\nacamamento (contacto com sedimentos abaixo das camadas de lavas ou as paredes das escoadas) \u00e9: \n\nDec=353.4\u00ba, Inc=52.8\u00ba (a95=1.5\u00ba, N=257). Tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 poss\u00edvel fazer se uma m\u00e9dia da componente \n\nm\u00e9dia por s\u00edtio paleomagn\u00e9tico. E nesse caso, para oito s\u00edtios tem-se: Dec=0\u00ba, Inc=50.4\u00ba (a95=8.3\u00ba, \n\nN=8). A componente magn\u00e9tica m\u00e9dia \u00e9 posteriormente usada para calcular o polo paleomagnetico e a \n\nsua confiabilidade \u00e9 avaliada estatisticamente pelos par\u00e2metros de Fisher nomeadamente: k, o \n\npar\u00e2metro de dispers\u00e3o das amostras em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a uma dada popula\u00e7\u00e3o; a95, o intervalo de 95% de \n\nconfian\u00e7a na direc\u00e7\u00e3o magn\u00e9tica m\u00e9dia; R, a direc\u00e7\u00e3o do vector resultante. Este par\u00e2metro \u00e9 \n\nrelativamente importante devido \u00e0 sua independ\u00eancia em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00famero de amostragem, N. A \n\ncomponente m\u00e9dia para todas as amostras e a componente m\u00e9dia por s\u00edtio paleomagn\u00e9tico \u00e9: \n\nPlat=83.3\u00ba,Plong=236.1\u00ba, (A95=1.8\u00ba, K=25.9) e Plat=84.4\u00ba,Plong=177.9\u00ba, (A95=9.8\u00ba, K=32.9), \n\nrespectivamente. Quando comparamos os polos obtidos com a curva de deriva polar da Ib\u00e9ria, \n\nconstru\u00edda a partir de uma compila\u00e7\u00e3o de v\u00e1rios autores, n\u00e3o existe similaridade com o polo da \n\nMessejana ou com polos de idades mais recentes. Por\u00e9m, se apenas considerarmos os polos \n\ngeomagn\u00e9ticos virtuais (VGP) de cada s\u00edtio de amostragem, observamos a presen\u00e7a de dois grupos de \n\ndirec\u00e7\u00f5es distintas: um grupo (designado por componente A) com uma direc\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia muito pr\u00f3xima \n\ndo polo da Messejana e um outro grupo (designado por componente B) com uma direc\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dia \n\nmuito distinta do polo da Messejana e sem qualquer similaridade com polos de idade mais recente da \n\nAPWP da Ib\u00e9ria. Tendo em conta que a direc\u00e7\u00e3o da componente B \u00e9 partilhada por 4 VGP\u2019s que est\u00e3o \n\ntodos localizados na parte central da bacia do Algarve, sugerimos que essa direc\u00e7\u00e3o da componente B \n\npode ser o resultado de movimentos tect\u00f3nicos posteriores.  \n\nEsses resultados fornecem uma base s\u00f3lida para estudos paleomagneticos futuros nas lavas da CAMP \n\nem Portugal. Uma perspectiva futura \u00e9 estudar novos s\u00edtios paleomagneticos de outra bacia, \n\nnomeadamente a bacia de Santiago do Cac\u00e9m, para verificar a origem da componente B e para obter \n\num novo polo paleomagn\u00e9tico com crit\u00e9rios estat\u00edsticos satisfat\u00f3rios. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: CAMP, Paleomagnetismo, Magnetismo de Rocha, Polo magn\u00e9tico \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n \n\nIndex \n \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nThe Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) is one of the largest Phanerozoic continental Large \n\nIgneous Province (LIP), associated with the disruption of Pangea and the opening of the central \n\nAtlantic Ocean (Marzoli et al., 1999). Similar to the Siberian and Deccan Traps, the CAMP \n\nmagmatism is apparently coeval with one of the five most severe mass extinction in the Phanerozoic, \n\nthe Triassic Jurassic (Tr-J) boundary ca. 200 Ma ago (McHone, 2002; P\u00e1lfy, 2003). Marzoli et al. \n\n(2004) suggested that the CAMP volcanism in Morocco preceded the Tr-J boundary, and thus can be \n\nresponsible for the associated biotic crisis. Such hypothesis is based on the presence of short \n\ngeomagnetic reversals recorded in the Moroccan CAMP lava (Knight et al. 2004) correlated by the \n\nauthors to the E23r anomaly of the Newark basin, USA (Kent and Olsen, 1999). However, the primary \n\norigin of these magnetic reversals has been recently challenged by the results brought during my \n\nbachelor scientific project and published in Font et al. (2011). In this work the authors demonstrated \n\nthat the negative polarities are actually the product of remagnetization and hydrothermal processes. \n\nThe debate remains open. \n\nPaleomagnetic techniques may be conducted on CAMP\u2019s outcrops not only to study its possible \n\nrelation to the Tr-J biological crisis, but more importantly, to infer the position and kinematic \n\nevolution of the continental plates contemporaneous with the eruption of these major magmatic \n\nprovince (Osete et al., 2011; Mart\u00ednez et al., 2012; Palencia-Ortas et al., 2006; Osete and Palencia-\n\nOrtas, 2006).   Even though the evolution of major plates, since Pangea break-up, is well known and \n\nconstrained (Besse and Courtillot, 2002; Torsvik et al., 2008) paleoreconstruction of micro plates such \n\nIberia is still problematic (Osete et al., 2011; Palencia-Ortas, 2006, Vissers and Meijer 2012; Neres et \n\nal., 2012). Neres et al. (2012) made a rigorous selection of paleomagnetic poles for the Iberian plate \n\nfrom Cretaceous to Late Jurassic ages and concluded that the Iberian Apparent Polar Wander Path \n\n(APWP) is coincident with the Global APWP of Torsvik et al. (2008) for ages younger than 120 Ma, \n\nbut fails toward older ages. The lack of reliable paleomagnetic poles and precise radiometric ages, as \n\nwell as uncertainties about Euler poles deduced from marine magnetic anomalies may be the source of \n\nthis misfit for the interval of interest (~200Ma). For example, the only reliable paleomagnetic pole for \n\nthe Iberian plate at 200 Ma is the Messejana pole (Palencia-Ortas et al., 2006). Thus, new reliable \n\npaleomagnetic poles are needed. \n\nThe aim of this work is to conduct a new rock magnetic and paleomagnetic  study on  CAMP lava\u2019s \n\nfrom the Algarve basin in order to: i) verify if the magnetic mineralogy of these rock is suitable for \n\npaleomagnetic investigation, ii) to test for the presence of E23r anomaly and iii)provide a new \n\npaleomagnetic pole for Iberia at 200 Ma. To reach these objectives, approximately 300 samples were \n\ncollected from nine sites distributed along an E-W transect from Sagres (western Portugal) to \n\nAyamonte (Spain). Field trips consist in three excursions of five days, which has been funded by FCT \n\n(IMPACTO: ref. PTDC/CTE-GIX/117298/2010). Magnetic measurements were conducted at the \n\nPaleomagnetic laboratory of IDL (Lisbon). Results provided a stable remanent magnetization, \n\nprobably contemporaneous with the cooling of the CAMP lavas. However, the newly founded pole is \n\nsignificantly different from the referenced Messejana pole due to the presence of two different and \n\nwell-constrained VGP\u2019s distribution. One of the distributions, \u201cA component\u201d, is close to the reference \n\npole, but the other, \u201cB component\u201d, is significantly different from the Messejana pole or any pole from \n\nthe Iberian APWP. This misfit is interpreted as the result of significant pos-eruption tectonic \n\nmovements. Finally, the results bring new insights to discuss the age and duration of CAMP \n\nvolcanism in Portugal as well as its correlations with CAMP sections cropping out in Morocco and \n\nUSA. \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       2 \n\n2. Geological settings and previous works \n\n2.1 CAMP (Global distribution) \n\nThe Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) is one of the largest flood basalt provinces known \n\nin the Phanerozoic, with an average volume greater than 2 1 \n \nkm\n\n \n and a peak activity at ~200 Ma, \n\nthus identified as the trigger of the mass extinction that brands the Tr-J boundary (Marzoli et al., 1999; \n\nVerati et al., 2007). It is associated with the breakup of the supercontinent, Pangea. CAMP volcanism \n\nis mainly represented by sills, lava flows and tholeiitic dykes characterized by low TiO2 \n\nconcentrations, and relatively low SiO2. CAMP lava flows can be found across four continents: \n\nNortheastern South America and Eastern North America, Northwestern Africa and Southwestern \n\nEurope (Fig. 1a). Geochemical data from these different continents suggests that CAMP lavas are \n\nmostly similar in composition (Marzoli et al., 1999; Marzoli et al., 2004).    \n\n \n\n Figure 1: Geological sketch map of CAMP. (A) Preserved Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) \nacross four continents. The gray line delimits the probable extent of CAMP lavas at the time of its \nextrusion. (B) Simplified geological map of Iberia. (C)  Map of southern Portugal. The dark lines \n\nindicate the main representations of CAMP, which includes the Messejana dyke and the Algarve and \nSantiago do Cac\u00e9m\u2019s basins. The balloons at the Algarve\u2019s basin represent the sampling locations.  \n\nOne of the best preserved and complete CAMP lava sequence (with outcrops thickness reaching 300 \n\nm) are found in Morocco, northwestern Africa and at the Newark basin, eastern North America. In \n\nMorocco, four primary units from CAMP volcanism were perfectly distinguished: The lower unit, \n\nintermediate unit, upper unit and recurrent unit (Knight et al., 2004; Marzoli et al., 2004) (Fig. 2). \n\nIn Newark basin, a thick and complete section was recovered and represents nowadays the best \n\ngeomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) covering the late Triassic- earlier Jurassic period (Kent and \n\nOlsen 1999).  The Tr-J boundary is assumed to be at ~202 Ma at the superchrone E24n, but the oldest \n\nCAMP lavas are identified ~40 kyr above this boundary, obviously refuting the role of CAMP on the \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       3 \n\nmass extinction (Kent and Olsen 1999) (Fig. 2). These authors also identified a very short reversal \n\npolarity (E23r) just below the Tr-J boundary, allegedly found on CAMP lavas in Morocco and \n\ncorrelated to the reversal E23r (Knight et al., 2004) (Fig. 2). This discovery would put an end on the \n\nrecurrent discussion about whether or not CAMP was the trigger of the mass extinction. However, on \n\nmy degree project and further published article, (Font et al., 2011) we were able to prove that the \n\nreversal found by Knight et al. (2004) was due to chemical remagnetization. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2: Correlation scheme for trans- Atlantic CAMP basins. On the right are showed the reversals \nfound by Knight et al., 2004 and its comparison with the Newark basin. On the left, is presented the \n\nmagnetostratigraphy of Argana basin and its comparison with the Newark basin. The reverse \u201cV\u201d \nrepresents the CAMP lavas. The white boxes represent clay. \n\n \n\nRecent studies conducted at the Argana basin reveals that the oldest CAMP lavas found at the Newark \n\nbasin are correlated to the second pulse of CAMP volcanism (intermediate unit) found at Morocco, \n\nwhich means that the first volcanic pulse (lower unit) have not reached US and puts the oldest CAMP \n\nlavas of Morocco at ~20kyr above the Tr-J boundary instead (Deneen et al., 2010) (Fig. 2). The \n\nauthors support the hypothesis of Phanerozoic mass extinction due to the emplacement of this LIP.  \n\n \n\n2.2 CAMP (Portuguese basins: studied area) \n\nThe preserved CAMP lava flows in Portugal are found at the Algarve basin, at the Santiago do Cac\u00e9m \n\nbasin (Fig. 1c) and in the Spanish Central System, where is located the Messejana dyke (Verati et al., \n\n2007; Palencia- Ortas et al., 2006). \n\nThe Algarve and Santiago do Cac\u00e9m basins comprises a basal sequence of continental sediments, \n\nnamely siltstones and limestones of Hettangian age (Youbi et al., 2003) on which CAMP volcanic \n\nproducts were emplaced among thin layers of limestones and dolomites, suggesting synchronism \n\nbetween the volcanism and sedimentation (Martins et al., 2007).  At the top of the sequence, the \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       4 \n\nvolcanic products are covered by a thick Early Jurassic limestone layer. These volcanic products are \n\nmostly represented by subaerial lava flows, pyroclastic deposits and peperites (Martins et al., 2007) \n\n(Fig. 3).   \n\nIn terms of geochemical composition, the Portuguese lava flows are classified as low Ti- tholeiitic \n\nbasalts enriched in large ion lithophile elements, which suggests partial melting of heterogeneous \n\nmantle sources (Martins et al., 2007). Comparison with the Moroccan sequence suggests that Algarve \n\nbasin outcrops are relatively homogeneous and similar to the Moroccan intermediate and upper unit \n\n(Marzoli et al., 2004; Rapaille et al., 2002) (Fig. 3). Recent 40Ar/39Ar data on the Portuguese volcanic \n\nunits yields an age close to the Tr-J boundary with a mean value of 198.1 \u00b10.4 Ma. This age is \n\ncorrelated to the recurrent unit of the Moroccan basins and suggests a synchronous rifting and \n\nvolcanism on both Southwestern Europe and Northeastern Africa (Marzoli et al., 2004; Verati et al., \n\n2007).  \n\nThe SW-NE oriented dyke of the Messejana (Fig. 1b) is also coeval with the age of the CAMP\u2019s \n\noutcrops (202.8 2.0 Ma).It comprises dolerite intrusions that obliquely cut the Hercynian basement \nfor more than 530 km from South Portugal (Alentejo) to Central Spain (Avila). Palencia Ortas et al. \n\n(2006), conducted a paleomagnetic study on 40 sites within the dyke which yielded a reliable \n\npaleomagnetic pole for the Iberian microplate at: Plat=70.4\u00ba, Plong=237.6\u00baE (K=47.9, A95=3.5\u00ba). \n\nHowever, no paleomagnetic investigation has been conducted in the Portuguese CAMP lavas yet. \n\n \nFigure 3: (A) Schematic stratigraphy of Moroccan and Portuguese outcrops and associated \n\nsedimentary layers (c.f.

Sampling \n\nSamples were collected at nine sites within the E-W elongated Algarve basin using a portable \n\ngasoline-powered drill and oriented using a magnetic and solar compass. Eight to nine cylinders were \n\ncollected at nine localities (e.g. \u201csites\u201d, Fig. 1c).  The samples collected in the field were subsequently \n\ncut in the laboratory into standard specimens (2.2 cm in length   2.5 cm in diameter) yielding 280 \nsamples for future paleomagnetic measurements (Fig. 4).  \n\n \nFigure 4: Field pictures from the Algarve basin\u2019s outcrops.

Methods \n\n4.1 Petrography \n\nPetrographic analyses were carried out in fresh specimens in order to discriminate the mineral content \n\nand textural features. Thin sections of a selected paleomagnetic sites (AA, AL, SB, FP; Fig.1c) were \n\nperformed at the geology department\u2019s laboratory to later on be observed on an optical microscope \n\nunder the supervision of Dr. L\u00ednia Martins.  \n\n4.2 Isothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM)  \n\nIsothermal Remanent Magnetization (IRM) is one of the most used rock magnetic technique to \n\nidentify the magnetic minerals present in a sample based on their coercivity. Common mineral such as \n\nmagnetite or pyrrotite (ferromagnetic) have low coercivity values, whereas antiferromagnetic minerals \n\nsuch as hematite and goethite have much higher coercivity values. Furthermore, the amplitude of the \n\nmagnetization saturation (SIRM) informs about the concentration of these magnetic minerals for a \n\nfixed volume.    \n\nRobertson &amp; France (1994) and Kruiver et al (2001) showed that IRM acquisition curve theoretically \n\nfollow a log normal distribution and are cumulative in intensity. The authors suggested that IRM \n\ncurves can be approximated by a cumulative log-Gaussian (CLG) function, described by 3 parameters: \n\nB1/2, SIRM and DP. DP is the dispersion parameter which reflects the distribution of the apparent \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       6 \n\ncoercivities of a mineral phase and which can be interpreted in terms of homogeneity/heterogeneity of \n\ngrain size and/or composition of a set of sample. Since IRM curve is the sum of each individual \n\nCLG\u2019s functions, this method allow the discrimination of each magnetic phase in the case of mixture. \n\nFor example, basalts are frequently constituted by magnetite and hematite, which can be easily \n\nidentify using the CLG function. \n\nRepresentative samples were previously demagnetized by an alternated magnetic field (AF) at 100 mT \n\nand further submitted to a progressive uniaxial and constant magnetic field up to 1 T at constant \n\ntemperature, using a pulse magnetizer (ASC Scientific IM-10-30). For the CLG treatment we used the \n\nKruiver et al (2001) software which allows fitting (by tentative and error) of B1/2, SIRM and DP values \n\non a linear (LAP), gradient (GAP) and probability (SAP) scale. If more than one mineral phase is \n\npresent, it is expected the theoretical curves to be fitted by more than one component. \n\n \n\n4.3 Thermomagnetic Analysis \n\nThermomagnetic curves were performed in order to identify the ferromagnetic minerals based on their \n\nCurie temperature. Curie (N\u00e9el) temperature is unique for a particular mineral and therefore is \n\ncommonly used to identify its composition. For example, magnetite has Curie temperature of 580\u00baC \n\nand can also be identified at low temperature measurements by its Verwey transition in the case of \n\nvery fine grained magnetite (a hump in magnetic susceptibility at ~-120\u00baC due to atoms \n\nrearrangements). Magnetite with higher content of titanium (Ti-rich titanomagnetite) has lower Curie \n\ntemperatures on the order of ~200\u00baC whereas for a Ti-poor titanomagnetite Curie temperatures are \n\n~560\u00baC. Hematite, on the other hand, has N\u00e9el temperatures (the equivalent of Curie temperature for \n\nantiferromagnetic minerals) much higher than magnetite (~680\u00baC) and its titanium content also \n\ninfluences its N\u00e9el temperature.  \n\nMagnetic susceptibility is measured at high and low temperature. The low temperature (LT) \n\nmeasurements are performed on a CS-L cryostat apparatus which uses liquid nitrogen to cool down \n\nthe equipment. Magnetic susceptibility is measured while the apparatus is warming up from -192\u00baC \n\n(e.g., temperature of the liquid nitrogen) up to the room temperature. The high temperature (HT) \n\nmeasurements are performed on a CS4 furnace in an Argon controlled atmosphere from the room \n\ntemperature until 700\u00baC. Subsequently, magnetic susceptibility is measured while the equipment is \n\ncooling down from 700\u00baC to room temperature. Both measurements were performed using a MFK1 \n\nKappabridge at the Laboratory of Paleomagnetism of the IDL. Data were treated by the Cureval 8.0 \n\n(AGICO) software. Later on, an approach to calculate the Curie temperature of ferromagnetic minerals \n\npresented on the rock is performed using the inverse susceptibility method proposed by Petrovsk\u00fd and \n\nKapricka (2006). \n\n \n\n4.4 Hysteresis data \n\nThe ferromagnetic minerals have a unique capacity to record the direction of an applied magnetic \n\nfield. Unlike paramagnetic or diamagnetic minerals, when the applied field is removed, the \n\nferromagnetic minerals will not return to zero and the offset from the origin is called magnetization of \n\nremanence, Mrs which is a record of the applied magnetic field. The path of the magnetization, J with \n\nrespect to the applied field, H is perfectly explained by the so called Hysteresis loop. \n\nHysteresis parameters have been extensively used to unravel the grain size of the magnetic carriers. \n\nThe Day plot was first proposed by Day et al. (1977) and is widely used in paleomagnetism to \n\ndiscriminate the domain state (single domain, SD; pseudo-single domain, PSD; multidomain, MD) of \n\nthe magnetic carriers. It is based on the ratio of hysteresis parameters (Mrs/Ms ? Hcr/Hc) where Mrs is \n\nthe maximum saturation remanence; Ms is the maximum saturation magnetization; Hcr is the remanent \n\ncoercive force (e.g. the field needed to reduce Mrs to zero) and  c is the bulk coercivity. The \n\ntheoretical bounds of the Day plot are defined by: Mrs/Ms>0.5 and Hcr/Hc<5 for the SD region; 0.5> \n\nMrs/Ms>0.05 and 1.5&lt;Hcr/Hc<5 for the PSD region and Mrs/Ms<0.02 and Hcr/Hc>5 for the MD region. \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       7 \n\nThe importance of this method relies on the necessity to know whether or not the paleomagnetic \n\nsamples contain SD magnetite since the latter are the best recorder of the ancient Earth\u2019s magnetic \n\nfield. This is because SD and even PSD (pseudo-single-domain) particles have higher coercive force, \n\n c than MD grains (Butler 1996).  \n\nMore recently, Dunlop et al., 2002 developed a theoretical day plot curve for magnetite for each \n\ndomain state and admixtures of magnetic grains (MD+SD; SD+SP). The main problems related to \n\nthese theoretical curves rely on the fact that the hysteresis parameters are not exclusively a function of \n\nthe domain state. Mineral composition, mixture of different minerals or minerals with different \n\ndomain state, thermal activation and magnetostatic interaction may lead to erroneous interpretations of \n\nDay diagrams. \n\nRoberts et al. (2000) developed a new method to discriminate the domain states, claiming that the use \n\nof Day plot diagrams can often leads to misinterpretations of the data. In this article, Roberts et al. \n\n(2000) present a new tool (FORC diagrams) not only to identify the magnetic domains (SD, SP, PSD \n\nand MD grains) but also to reveal whether or not magnetic interaction is present. FORC\u2019s diagrams \n\nare obtained after submitting a sample to a saturating magnetic field ( b) and then, decrease the field \n\nto a reversal magnetic field (Ha). First Order Reversal Curves (FORC) is defined as the resultant \n\nmagnetization curve between Ha and Hb. This measurement was repeated for different reversal fields \n\nyielding a set of FORC (for each reversal field) that fills the inside of a hysteresis loop. The FORC \n\ndiagram, mostly used, is a contour plot of a FORC distribution displayed on a Hu [Hu=(Ha+Hb)/2] \n\nversus Hc [Hc=(Hb-Ha)/2] plot, where Hc represents the coercive force of the magnetic grains on the \n\nspecimen and Hu is the local interaction field. \n\nFor the present study, hysteresis measurements and FORC diagram were performed at nine \n\ncharacteristic samples from each paleomagnetic site. The measurements were performed using a \n\nVibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM) with a maximum applied field of 1T at the University of \n\nMarie Curie, Paris. Dunlop\u2019s theoretical curves are used for comparison of hysteresis parameter. \n\n \n\n4.5 AF cleaning \n\nThe specimens were subjected to a progressive alternating magnetic field (AF demagnetization) using \n\na LDA-3A demagnetizer from 0 (Natural Remanent Magnetization, NRM) up to 100 mT. This process \n\nis used to eliminate low-field secondary magnetizations that the rock might have acquired subsequent \n\nto its formation and to identify the direction of the original remanent magnetization recorded in the \n\nrock during its formation. At each AF demagnetization step, the remanence is measured using a JR6 \n\nmagnetometer. Principal Component Analysis (Kirschvink, 1980) and Fisher statistic (Fisher, 1953) \n\nare then used to calculate the direction of the Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM). These \n\ncalculations are made by using the REMASOFT software (AGICO). \n\nA total of 280 specimens were submitted to AF cleaning for which 257 specimens gave reliable \n\ndirections that were used to calculate the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM). Erroneous \n\ndata \u201cOutliers\u201d were eliminated using the Vandamme (1994) cutoff angle method which is based on a \n\nrecursive method that optimizes the probability of finding the true mean direction.  \n\nThe paleomagnetic pole is calculated either using mean ChRM direction computed for all samples or \n\nfor all sites. Reliability of the final paleomagnetic pole is evaluated using the Q criteria of Van der \n\nVoo (1990). Comparison of the paleomagnetic pole with other referenced pole is made by using the \n\nMcFadden and Lowes (1981) test. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       8 \n\n5. Results \n\nThis section will be subdivided into two main groups: magnetic mineralogy and paleomagnetic results. \n\nThe first approach is to show if the primary magnetic mineralogy has been preserved since rock \n\nformation or if it has been altered by chemical processes. Paleomagnetic results will provide new \n\ngeochronological data (through the magnetic polarity recorded by the rocks; e.g. magnetostratigraphy) \n\nand a new paleomagnetic pole and its eventual use for paleogeographic reconstructions will be \n\ndiscussed by comparison with the key pole of the Messejana dyke and CAMP lavas from Morocco. \n\n5.1 Magnetic mineralogy \n\nRock magnetic studies are essential to identify the dominant magnetic carriers presented in \n\npaleomagnetic specimens. It is of extreme importance to infer whether or not there is preservation of \n\nthe primary magnetization otherwise, the paleomagnetic studies would be useless to reconstruct the \n\nglobal paleogeography of the Earth plates.   \n\nIn this subsection, powerful tools are used to constrain the nature, grain-size, origin and type of \n\nferromagnetic minerals characteristic of the CAMP basalts from Portugal, namely: petrography, IRM \n\n(Isothermal Remanent Magnetization), Thermomagnetic analysis and Day plot and FORC\u2019s (First \n\nOrder Reversal Curves). \n\n5.1.1 Petrography \n\nAlgarve lava flows are porphyritic rocks with a characteristic aphanitic texture, mainly due to its fast \n\ncooling which prevent the growth of the minerals. The samples are characterized by the presence of \n\nfew phenocrystals developed in a matrix of finer grains. The samples showed a simple mineralogy \n\nmainly dominated by plagioclase, clinoperoxenes, feldspaths and opaque minerals (Fig. 5). \n\nThe opaque crystals correspond to ferromagnetic minerals. Their preserved subeuedric morphology \n\nsuggests primary origin. \n\n \nFigure 5: Petrographic example of CAMP's outcrops (AL) collected at the Algarve' basin. \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       9 \n\n5.1.2 IRM acquisition curves \n\nA total of 34 samples (2 to 12 per paleomagnetic site) were analyzed. All studied samples display a \n\nsimilar behavior during the gradual acquisition of uniaxial isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM). \n\nSaturation (SIRM) in most samples is reached below 100mT suggesting a low coercive phase as the \n\ndominant magnetic carrier (magnetite?) despite the presence of a higher coercive phase (hematite?) at \n\nfew samples which do not attain saturation (Fig. 6). \n\n \nFigure 6: Isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM) analysis.

Once representing IRM \n\ndata on a logarithmic scale for the induced field (H in mT; Fig. 6B) significant differences in B1/2 \n\nvalues (field needed to reach half of the saturation) are observed ranging from 16.2 mT (HT2.E2) to \n\n53.7 mT (AA1.E4; Table 1). \n\nAfter treatment by the cumulative log-Gaussian function (CLG) using the Kruiver\u2019s software (Kruiver \n\net al., 2001), it is shown that almost all samples display a unimodal distribution, despite the presence \n\nof bimodal distribution at some samples (Fig. 6C; Fig. 6D). The unimodal distribution (e.g. JG1.B2; \n\nFig 6C) is characterized by a single Gaussian curve for which SIRM values lie between 240 A/m \n\n(QO.F2) and 500 A /m (AL1.B2; Table 1) and the mean coercivity fields with ranges of 16.2 mT \n\n(HT2.E2) to 52.5 mT (QO.F2). Through the values of SIRM and bulk coercivity of this distribution, it \n\nis possible to infer that the mineral presented in those samples is of low coercive phase, possibly \n\nmagnetite (Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir, 1997; Lowrie, 1997). \n\n \n\nTable 1: SIRM, B1/2 and DP estimates for characteristic samples using the Kruiver software \n\n \n \n\nBimodal distributions are also found at some samples. (e.g. SB1.C3; Fig. 6D) Non-saturated curve is \n\neasily observable on GAP and SAP diagrams. As IRM acquisition curve are linearly added, if more \n\nthan one magnetic phase is present, mixtures are immediately denoted by the presence of more than \n\none Gaussian curve (GAP diagram) and deflections of the distribution (SAP diagram). Two magnetic \n\nphases are present: a low coercivity phase, with SIRM values on the hundreds order and coercivity \n\nvalues similar to those found at the unimodal distribution. This low coercive phase, presented in all \n\nsamples, is thought to be magnetite and contributes with more than 80 % to the total remanence while \n\nthe higher magnetic phase reaches  ~20% maximum of the IRM signal (Fig. 6E). The higher coercive \n\nphase is characterized by much lower SIRM values ranging from 16 A/m (RL2.G3) to 36 A/m \n\n(AA1.E4; Table 1) and coercivities significantly higher than the low coercive phase, ranging between \n\n251.2 mT (RL1.E3; AA1.E4) to 275.4 mT (RL2.G3). The strong similarity of B1/2 and DP values for \n\nboth component 1 and component 2 in all specimens suggests the presence of homogeneous \n\npopulations of the soft (lower coercivity) and hard (high coercivity) magnetic fractions in terms of \n\ncomposition and grain size (Fig. 6E). The CLG parameters of the Portuguese CAMP lavas are strongly \n\nsimilar to those found in the CAMP lavas from Morocco (Font et al., 2011) confirming primary \n\n(magmatic) origin for these minerals. \n\n \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       11 \n\n5.1.3 Thermomagnetic Analysis  \n\nConsidering that several minerals such as magnetite and pyrrhotite, goethite and hematite have similar \n\nmaximum coercivities, (Lowrie, 1997) interpretation of IRM acquisition curves alone, cannot be used \n\nto identify the composition of the magnetic carriers. In order to do that thermomagnetic analyses of \n\nrepresentative samples (1 per paleomagnetic site). Just like IRM measurements, among all the \n\nmeasured thermomagnetic curves, merely two different behaviors are found and illustrated (Fig. 7). \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Low and High temperature thermomagnetic curves (on the left) and the respective inverse \nsusceptibility method (on the right). \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       12 \n\nCurie temperatures are calculated using the inversion method of Petrovsk\u00fd and Kapricka (2006). \n\nAccording to Curie temperatures, two distinct groups of samples can be recognized. Group A, (e.g. \n\nSB3-A; QO-H; RL2-F; Fig. 7) characterized by a single ferromagnetic phase with Curie Temperatures \n\nranging from 564.9\u00ba to 577.6\u00baC (Fig. 7), compatible with Ti-poor titanomagnetite (Dunlop and \n\n\u00d6zdemir 1997). The positive alteration index characteristic of this group suggests formation of new \n\nmineral during the heating process, most likely magnetite (Hrouda et al., 2002; Hrouda 2003). Group \n\nB, (e.g. AY1-B; AL1-C; AA1-C; Fig. 7) characterized by the presence of at least two magnetic phases \n\nwhere Ti-poor titanomagnetite is the dominant with Curie temperatures ranging from 554\u00baC to 583\u00baC. \n\nA hump at ~240\u00baC to 320\u00baC is observed during the heating process (AA1-C; AY1-B; AL1-C; Fig.7) \n\nbut is no longer observed on the cooling curve (Fig. 7).  This behavior is interpreted as the result of \n\ntitanomaghemite instability during heating (Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir 1997) resulting on the inversion to a \n\nmultiphase mixture of magnetite, ilmenite, pseudobrokite and other minerals (Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir \n\n1997, \u00d6zdemir, 1987). The positive alteration index in some samples, suggest the inversion of \n\ntitanomaghemite into newly formed magnetite (AA1-C; Fig. 7) while others (AY1-B; AL1-C; Fig. 7) \n\nare characterized by negative alteration index which suggests the disintegration of the original mineral \n\nphase into lower susceptibility residual phase (Hrouda et al., 2002).  \n\nVerwey transition is present in all samples (Fig. 7) and branded by the typical hump at ~ -150\u00baC, \n\ncharacteristic of structural changes on magnetite (Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir 1997, \u00d6zdemir et al, 1993). \n\nThe magnitude of the Verwey transition for the samples on the group A is markedly higher than for \n\nthe samples on the group B. As the samples from the group B suffered from low-oxidation processes, \n\n(i.e. maghemetization) the Verwey transition is suppressed which leads to this clear difference on the \n\nmagnitude of the transition in both groups (\u00d6zdemir et al., 1993).  \n\n \n\n5.1.1 Hysteresis data \n\nCoercivity and remanence ratios (Mrs/Mr and Hcr/Hc) were plotted on the theoretical curve of Dunlop \n\net al. (2002) (Fig. 8). All data fall on the left region of the SD and MD mixture of the modified day \n\nplot (Dunlop, 2002) with values ranging between 1.86 and 3.42 for the coercivity ratios and between \n\n0.07 and 0.25 for the remanence ratios (Fig. 8). \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Modified Day plot showing the domain state of CAMP samples compared with theoretical \n\nmixing curves (Dunlop, 2002) \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       13 \n\n It is interesting to note that all SB samples have the lowest remanence ratios and the highest \n\ncoercivity ratios while all FP samples closely follows the SD+MD mixing curves toward higher \n\nremanence ratios. According to the literature, this could mean that FP samples have magnetites with \n\nlower grain size than SB samples. On the other hand, AL samples apparently have a larger range of \n\ngrain sizes. This SD+MD mixture is typical of basalts which cools fast enough so that the grain size of \n\nthe opaque minerals is typically of few \u00b5m but also may carry larger grains due to growth when the \n\nlava flows are thick enough. \n\n \n\n5.1.1 FORC\u2019s \n\nThree characteristic FORC diagrams are shown which are representative of the typical behaviors \n\nfound on the 6 analyzed samples (Fig. 9). \n\n \n\nFigure 9: FORC diagrams for characteristic samples.  \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       14 \n\nAL1-H sample (Fig. 9) displays a narrow distribution, slightly above the origin of the magnetic \n\ninteracting field (Hu), suggesting the existence of interaction between the magnetic particles. The \n\nmean coercivity field (Hc) value has a peak distribution at ~17 mT, which is slightly below of what is \n\nexpected for a pure SD magnetite (Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir, 1997, Muxworthy et al., 2002). The \n\ndisplacement of Hc to lower values and the presence of vertical contours in the lower-left part of \n\nFORC\u2019s distribution, (practically parallel to Hu axis) suggest magnetic interactions between SP and \n\nSD particles. Conversely, FP1-D (Fig. 9) displays a typical non-interacting SD particle with close \n\ncontours at Hu=0 and a peak distribution of coercivity field at ~20mT. However, the presence of a \n\nsecond peak at the origin (Hi=0 and Hc=0) with a shape similar to AL1-H leads to the conclusion that \n\nSP particles are also present in this sample. \n\nSB1-H sample (Fig. 9) is very similar with AL1-H sample (Fig. 9). The largest displacement toward \n\nlower coercivity field values (~7 mT) and a slight shift above Hu=0 suggests that SP and SD particles \n\nare present on the sample, both with similar intensities.  \n\nAll FORC\u2019s distributions suggest a SD+SP mixture for the analyzed samples. Conversely, day plots \n\nstrongly follow the SD+MD trend, but on these samples, there are no evidences of MD-like behavior. \n\nIn order to verify if SP particles are present, such has been suggested by FORC analysis, we have \n\nconducted Kfd analysis. The Kfd is a proxy to evaluate the contribution of superparamagnetic particles \n\nwithin the bulk mineralogy (Dearing et al., 1999). For low frequency measurements (klf), the SP \n\ngrains close to the boundary of SD grains, contributes to the bulk susceptibility whilst at high \n\nfrequency measurements (khf) does not. Our results show no SP contribution, consistent with Day plot \n\nresults (Table A1). \n\n \n\n5.2 Paleomagnetic Results \n\nA total of 280 samples were demagnetized at the IDL laboratory using AF treatment. Most samples \n\nyielded stable demagnetization patterns at high fields. More than 90% of the remanence is \n\ndemagnetized between 40 mT (JG samples) and 100 mT, (SB samples) suggesting a low to medium \n\ncoercive phase as the dominant magnetic carrier (Fig. 10). \n\nZijderveld diagrams (orthogonal diagrams) show the presence of two magnetic components: a high \n\nfield remanence projected to the origin of the diagrams, and a lower coercivity component, interpreted \n\nas a secondary viscous (VRM) magnetization which is successfully removed with fields lower than 20 \n\nmT (Fig. 10). \n\nNatural Remanent Magnetization (NRM) intensity lies between 0.4 A/m to 13.5 A/m, typical of \n\nbasalts (Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir, 1997), despite the wide range of intensity which may be due to \n\nsuperficial chemical alteration and to error associated to the volume of samples (some samples being \n\nfractured).  \n\nFrom the 280 samples, 257 were used to calculate the characteristic magnetic component (ChRM). \n\nOutliers were excluded based on the Vandamme (1994) cut-off by using the rotepole software \n\n(Ultreicht). All magnetic directions are positive (normal) with mean inclinations of 40\u00ba to 45\u00ba (Fig. \n\n11). Mean ChRM (characteristic remanent magnetization) were calculated based on samples (sample-\n\nbased mean direction) and on average direction per paleomagnetic site (site-based mean direction) \n\n(Table 3). Tilt corrections were applied to the data in order to correct for eventual post-tectonic \n\nmovements. Tilt corrected sample-based mean direction yields: Dec=353.4\u00ba and Inc=52.8\u00ba (N=257, \n\na95=1.5\u00ba, k=35.8) (Fig. 11B, left). Tilt corrected site-based mean direction yields: Dec=0\u00ba and \n\nInc=50.4\u00ba (N=8, a95=8.3\u00ba, k=45.6) (Fig. 11B, right). After tilt correction (Fig. 11B) the dispersion \n\nparameter k is significantly higher (i.e. lower dispersion; k=45.6) than the non-corrected data (k=23.2; \n\nFig. 11A) suggesting a pre-tectonic origin for the magnetization. \n\nThe paleomagnetic pole for the Portuguese CAMP basalts is calculated based on sample-and site-\n\nbased mean directions, yielding: Plat=83.3\u00ba, Plong=236.1\u00ba (A95=1.8\u00ba; K=25.9) and Plat=84.4\u00ba, \n\nPlong=177.9\u00ba (A95=9.8\u00ba; K=32.9), respectively.

Stereographic \nprojection (on the left) and orthogonal projections and remanence intensity versus the demagnetizing \n\nfield (on the right) \n\nThe fact that the site-based mean pole present high values of A95 is probably due to the existence of \n\ntwo distinct groups of direction (A and B components; c.f. Fig. 11), which are discussed later. \n\nIn order to check for the quality of a paleomagnetic pole, Van Der Voo (1990) proposed a useful set of \n\nseven reliability criteria, constituting the so-called Q-criteria (Table 2). Our new paleomagnetic pole \n\npasses 4 of the 7 criteria of Van Der Voo (1990), namely: \n\n1. An accurate radiometric age for CAMP lavas provided by Verati et al. (2007); \n\n2.

However, we propose to substitute the reversal Q-\n\ncriteria by our detailed magnetic mineralogy study, giving Q=5.

Discussion \n\nThe results presented here give us new clues to i) investigate if the magnetic mineralogy of the \n\nPortuguese CAMP lava is preserved and suitable to provide a new paleomagnetic pole for Iberia at \n\n200 Ma, ii) to test if this newly found pole is reliable for paleogeographic reconstructions, and iii) to \n\nprovide magnetostratigraphic data for global-scale correlations with other CAMP section worldwide. \n\n6.1 Magnetic mineralogy of the Portuguese CAMP lavas \n\nRock magnetic studies are essentials to understand the type and domain of the ferromagnetic mineral \n\nwithin the rock, but mostly, they are crucial to check if the samples are suitable for paleomagnetic \n\nstudies. Despite the severe alteration of the entire Algarve\u2019s basin region already reported by previous \n\ngeochemical studies (Martins et al., 2007; Verati et al., 2007) primary NRM directions seems to have \n\nbeen preserved. \n\nRock magnetic experiments conducted on the Portuguese CAMP lavas indicate the presence of a low \n\nto medium coercivity mineral, despite the accessory contribution of a higher coercivity in some \n\nsamples (Fig. 6). The low to medium coercive phase corresponds to fine Ti-poor titanomagnetite as \n\nshown by typical Curie temperatures of 560\u00ba-580\u00baC (Fig.7). Thermomagnetic analysis clearly shows a \n\nVerwey transition at around -150\u00baC characteristic of magnetite. Presence of maghemite is also \n\nidentified based on its inversion temperature observed at ~250-350\u00baC in some samples (Fig. 7). \n\nHowever, hematite is not depicted in our thermomagnetic curves indicating that it may be present only \n\nin very low content (Fig. 7). \n\nHysteresis parameters plotted on the modified Day plot (Dunlop, 2002) follow the trend of SD-MD \n\nmagnetite (Fig. 8). FORC\u2019s data rather suggests a SD+SP assemblage (Fig. 9). Kfd measurements \n\nconducted on characteristic samples yielded no SP contribution and led to the conclusion that SP \n\ncontribution is minor in our samples.  \n\nIn conclusion, the magnetic mineralogy of the Portuguese CAMP is mainly controlled by fine Ti-poor \n\ntitanomagnetite and accessorily maghemite and hematite depending on the oxidation state of the \n\nsamples. Such mineralogy is typical of extrusive basalts of continental rifting (Dunlop and \u00d6zdemir, \n\n1997) and we thus conclude that these rocks are good candidate for paleomagnetic studies.  \n\n6.2 Paleomagnetic reconstructions of Iberia at 200 Ma \n\nPaleomagnetism is the unique geophysics tool that allows plate tectonic reconstruction for times older \n\nthat ~180 Ma (i.e. the age of the oldest oceanic crust). It is based on the principle that inclination of the \n\nmagnetization depends on the latitude of the plate (i.e. the so-called dipole law of the Geocentric \n\nDipole Axial) and that the drift of a plate can be reconstructed by the drift of the corresponding \n\npaleomagnetic poles. Therefore, by comparing the paleomagnetic pole drift, called Apparent Polar \n\nWander Path (APWP), of two distinct plates and at different times allow us to constrain the kinematic \n\nof plate tectonics. The best example is the opening of the Atlantic Ocean and the separation of Europe \n\nwith North America (Fig. 12). \n\nThe problematic concerning the Iberian plate is that it\u2019s APWP its poorly constrained, notably for our \n\ninterval of interest (Neres et al., 2012; Osete et al., 2011). Indeed, the unique high-quality \n\npaleomagnetic pole for Iberia at 200 Ma is the Messejana pole (Palencia-Ortas et al 2006; Osete et al., \n\n2011) (Fig. 13).  \n\nWhen comparing our paleomagnetic poles with the APWP of Iberia computed from a compilation of \n\nNeres et al. (2012) and Osete et al. (2011), there is an overlap of the site-based mean pole with poles \n\nof younger age but the sample-based mean pole does not show any resemblance (Fig. 13).  Anyhow, it \n\nis obvious that neither sample-based nor site-based paleomagnetic pole from this study show an \n\noverlap with the reference pole from the Messejana dyke (Palencia-Ortas et al., 2006). The partial \n\nresemblance with the poles from younger ages (70 Ma, 80 Ma, 180 Ma; Fig 12) is probably due to \n\nlarge a95 values of the site-based mean pole. \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       19 \n\n \nFigure 12:a) Paleozoic and Mesozoic APWP paths from North America (solid circles) and Europe \n\n(open circles). The solid square represents the Euler pole to reconstruct the APWP path of each plate; \nb) Middle Jurassic paleogeographic reconstruction of North America and Europe (c.f. Butler 1996). \n\nBy comparing our individual CAMP lava VGP\u2019s with individual VGP\u2019s from the Messejana dyke \n\n(Palencia-Ortas et al., 2006), we have found that this high dispersion is caused by the presence of two \n\ndifferent VGP\u2019s distributions (Fig. 14). On one hand, there are four VGP\u2019s from this study (SB, QO, \n\n T and JG) that fall within the Messejana VGP\u2019s distribution, whereas the remaining 4 VGP\u2019s (AL, \n\nAA, RL and FP; Fig. 14) are far from the mean direction of the first group and significantly distinct \n\nfrom Messejana VGP\u2019s distribution. Note that the difference between the two groups of directions \n\nresides essentially in changes in declination values and that VGP\u2019s from the B component directions \n\nare all geographically located at the central part of Algarve\u2019s basin (Fig. 1).  \n\nThere are several hypotheses to explain the discrepancy between the directions of A and B \n\ncomponents: Cretaceous remagnetization, different ages, lightning or tectonics. The Cretaceous \n\nremagnetization is excluded since there is no overlap between component B directions and the \n\nCretaceous poles at 70 and 80 Ma (Fig. 13). The hypothesis of a different age for the component B is \n\nalso unlikely because previous geochemical studies on Portuguese lava flows show a good agreement \n\nbetween the Moroccan basalts and the studied rocks, including local from component B (Marzoli et \n\nal., 2004). In addition, recent \n40\n\nAr/\n39\n\nAr dating suggests that the lava flows from the Algarve basins are \n\nconcordant with the \n40\n\nAr/\n39\n\nAr ages of CAMP basalts from Moroccan basins (Verati et al., 2007). There \n\nis no significant difference between the age of the Alte lava outcrops (site AL here) and those from \n\nSantiago do Cac\u00e9m and Tavira sites (Verati et al., 2007).  \n\nLighting is a physical mechanism that can remagnetize superficial rocks. In such a case, the intensity \n\nof the NRM is thought to be more than one order higher than the original NRM intensity. In our case \n\nthere is no significant increase in NRM intensities when comparing component A and component B \n\ndata suggesting that lighting is not the favored hypothesis to explain the discrepancy between \n\ncomponent A and B.  \n\nWe rather suggest that significant tectonic movements on the central part of Algarve basin linked to \n\ncomplex movements on the S\u00e3o Marcos-Quarteira fault (SMQF) can produce significant deformations \n\non the eastern part of the fault, accommodating various minor thrusts and folds (Terrinha, 1998). \n\nSMQF was reactivated during Mesozoic lithospheric extension and has been acting ever since. \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       20 \n\n \nFigure 13: Comparison of the newly paleomagnetic pole of ~200 Ma (Sample-based mean, red \n\nsquare; Site-based mean, green square ) with the APWP of the Iberian plate (Southern hemisphere \nrepresented) and with Messejana dyke pole (blue square).

The problematic resides in the difficulty to date \n\nand correlate with accuracy the age of continental flood basalts from the CAMP lavas in continents \n\nand the age of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in marine sections (Knight et al., 2004; Marzoli et al., \n\n1999).  In the Newark basin (USA), previous studies placed the Tr-J boundary before the eruptions of \n\nthe first CAMP lavas (Kent and Olsen 1999) suggesting that CAMP cannot be responsible for the Tr-J \n\ncrisis. According to the authors, the onset of CAMP volcanism is proposed to occur ~40 yr after the \n\nTr-J boundary. On the other hand, based on geochemical data and \n40\n\nAr/\n39\n\nAr dating of individual flows \n\nfrom Morocco and Newark, Marzoli et al. (2004) showed that the lowest unit basalts found in the \n\nNewark basin is correlated to the intermediate unit in the Moroccan basin. This means that the \n\ndiscrepancy between the Tr-J boundary and the first lavas found in both basin is due to the inexistence \n\nof the lower unit CAMP on the Newark basin. \n\nMagnetostratigraphy has also been used to investigate the age and correlation of CAMP lavas from \n\ndifferent continents. Magnetostratigraphic data of CAMP lavas from Newark basin and Moroccan \n\nbasin encompasses a large interval of positive (normal) magnetic polarity, called the E24n chron. In \n\nNewark, Kent and Olsen (1999) identified a short interval of negative polarity located below the first \n\nCAMP lava and below the peak in spores interpreted by the authors to be the Tr-J boundary (Fig. 15). \n\nIn Morocco, Knight et al. (2004) found a negative interval in the Intermediate unit of the Moroccan \n\nCAMP lavas, that the authors correlated to the E23r of Newark. Based on the presence of this reversal, \n\nKnight et al., (2004) suggested that the CAMP lavas in Morocco preceded the Tr-J boundary. \n\nHowever, these reversals were challenged by Font et al., (2011) who proved that they were result of \n\nchemical remagnetization. More recently Deenen et al. (2010) identified a negative shift in the C-\n\nisotope values just before the basalts deposition suggesting that the first Moroccan CAMP lavas \n\ncoincide with the Tr-J mass extinction (Fig. 15).  \n\n \n\nFigure 15: A) Trans- Atlantic CAMP correlation between Newark basin (US) and Argana basin \n(Morocco); B) Composite of the Terrestrial trans-Atlantic CAMP basins (c.f.

Seven sites with the \n\ncorresponding VGP latitude variations are displayed (Fig. 16). All samples collected in the Algarve \n\nbasin display a positive (normal) remanent magnetization, confirming previous magnetostratigraphic \n\nstudies conducted on CAMP\u2019s lavas worldwide (Kent et al., 1999; Deenen et al., 2 11; Font et al., \n\n2011). Considering that recent radio-isotopic ages have been conducted on Algarve\u2019s outcrops and \n\nyielded a mean age of 198.1\u00b10.4 Ma, (Verati et al., 2007) the positive interval found in all \n\npaleomagnetic sites is here correlated to the E24n Superchron (Fig. 15). No reverse anomaly has been \n\nfound contrarily to Knight et al. (2004).  \n\nComparing the paleomagnetic (Dec and Inc) directions of successive lava flows also provide \n\ninformation about eruptions times (Chenet et al., 2009). In this study, we found no significant \n\nvariations of paleomagnetic direction per site except for HT site that has two distinct volcanic pulses \n\nseparated by a thin interval of dolomite (Fig. 16; Table A2). The remaining sites don\u2019t display \n\nsignificant variations on paleomagnetic directions which led us to the conclusion that a single volcanic \n\npulse is present. \n\n \n\n7. Conclusion \n\nThe main findings of this study may be summarized as follows: \n\n1. Magnetic mineralogy indicates that the main magnetic carriers are primary Ti-poor \ntitanomagnetite with accessorily presence of maghemite and hematite in some samples. Such \n\nmineralogy is typical of continental basalt and indicates that these rocks are good candidates \n\nfor paleomagnetic study. \n\n2. AF cleaning provided stable demagnetization patters at high field which yielded normal \npolarities ChRM (Tilt corrected) located at: Dec=0\u00ba; Inc=52.8\u00ba; a95=9.8\u00ba, N=8. The \n\ncorresponding pole is located at: Plat=84.4\u00ba, Plong=177.9\u00ba (K= 32.9; A95=9.8\u00ba) \n\n3. The lack of consistency of this pole with those obtained by Palencia-Ortas et al., (2006) is \nprobably due to the existence of two different VGP\u2019s distributions (component A and \n\ncomponent B) that shifts the pole direction away from the Messejana pole. Component A \n\nshares the same distribution as the Messejana VGP\u2019s, whereas component B does not share \n\nthe same distribution. \n\n4. The origin of the discrepancy between component A and component B is attributed to tectonic \nmovements on the central region of the Algarve basin. \n\n5. All Portuguese CAMP lavas encompass a normal magnetic polarity interval and no negative \ninterval has been depicted. It confirms previous results by Font et al. (2011) that the E23r \n\nanomaly of the Newark basin is not recorded in the Moroccan and Portuguese CAMP lava \n\nflows. The normal polarity is correlated to the E24n chron. \n\n6. Short variations in VGP latitudes and longitude along individual lava flows suggests a \nrelatively rapid cooling time. Except for the outcrops located near Sagres (HT) where two \n\ndistinct pulses are separated by a thin (~1-2 m) interval of dolomite, most of the studied \n\nsections represent a single volcanic pulse.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nPaleo- and rock magnetism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) from Portugal: global-\n\nscale correlations and implications for the paleogeography of Iberia at 200 Ma. \n\nSusana Fernandes       24 \n\n8.
