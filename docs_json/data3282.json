The gabbro named Santa Catarina is intruded in the Metamorphic Complex Vaca-ca\u00ed, a metassedimentary sequence where several gold deposits were recognized. In this study, nine lines of land magnetometry were performed with 1.200m in length each, a total of 10.800m and 720 reading stations. The results suggest the presence of filonian mineralization in fractures, some of which are subject to weathering action, releasing and transporting gold by water action and depositing it along the stream sediments downstream from the gabbro. The analytical signal map outlines areas of high magnetic susceptibility within its boundaries, coinciding with structural lineaments in the NS and EW directions, associated with the last of the four stages of regional deformation, possibly responsible for both fracturing and opening of spaces in the gabbro, as by remobilization of sulfide and gold recognizably described in several gold deposits within the Vacaca\u00ed Metamorphic Complex.\nKeywords: mineral exploration; gabbro; fracture; analytic signal.\nResumo\nEsse estudo consiste na aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o de dados magnetom\u00e9tricos na regi\u00e3o de S\u00e3o Sep\u00e9 (RS), sul do Brasil, com o prop\u00f3sito de avaliar o potencial de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o aur\u00edfera de um gabro, a partir de ind\u00edcios obtidos em prospec\u00e7\u00e3o geoqu\u00edmica de sedimentos de corrente pr\u00e9vios.

This is achieved through a series of techniques for direct and indirect geological investigations, planned in a manner to provide increased detailing of the mineralized geological conditions.\nSearches using indirect tools such as geophysical investigations make in-depth investigations possible by measuring intrinsic physical properties and geological materials such as mineral accumulations. Such methods are represented by applied geophysics, whose data can be acquired through aerial surveys and ground campaigns, besides the use of remote sensing\nLocation and geology of the study area\nThe study area is represented by gabbro Santa Catarina, is located in the south of Brazil, in the city of S\u00e3o Sep\u00e9 city, State of Rio Grande do Sul, about 270 km distant from from Porto Alegre city, and accessed by the BR 290 highway between the towns of South Cacapava do Sul and Vila Nova do Sul.\nFilonian gold mines are represented in the region by ores characterized by associations of quartz veins with gold and small amounts of iron oxides, pyrite and chalcopyrite. The veins present NE and NW directions and are preferably embedded in rock types of\nand aerial photos (Telford et al, 1990; Moon et al, 2006).\nAmong the several geophysical methods, magnetometry shows good results, referring to geological structural mapping, as well as associations between magnetic fields and possible mineralization. This method can provide indications of mineral accumulations such as sulfides and oxides, quite contrasting with the main minerals that form rocks, such as silicates.\nResearch in potentially mineralized targets of copper, gold, iron oxides, for example, enable detailing by magnetometry, subsequently confirmed by sampling and geochemistry. Studies such as those of Sharma (1986), Doyle, (1990); Fallon &amp;\nthe Vacacai Metamorphic Complex, subconcordant or discordant to the general structure (Figure 2).\nA geochemical study of the collected stream sediment sample taken approximately 1 km downstream from the center of Santa Catarina gabbro drainage recorded 48 pints of gold, well above the average 45 gold particles characteristic for the region, besides arsenopyrite and pyrite together with heavy minerals (CPRM , 2000).\nThe investigated area is located in southern Brazil in the central sector of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, in the\nBacko, (1994); Vella, (1994); Maas et al., (2003); Nabighian, etal, (2005); Jackson, (2005); Rodrigues et al., (2006); Oliveira (2007), Batista et al., (2006); Batista, et al., (2008); Sultan et al., (2009), S\u00faarez etal., (2012) and Gon\u00e7alves etal., (2013) reinforce the effectiveness of this method in mineral exploration.\nThis paper presents and discusses the application of data from a magnetometry survey method developed for assessing the potential for gold mineralization in a gabbro, justified by evidence of the gold mineralization obtained in geochemical prospection of stream sediment, collected in the drainage originated from the gabbro 1km downstream of the study area center.\nunit denominated Sulriograndense Shield, represented by metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary rocks, with Archean and Proterozoic ages, compartmentalized into blocks and bordered by large regional faulting in the NE-SW directions (Paim et al. 2000).\nThe Basic/Ultrabasic Stratiform Complex covers the area of study and comprises layered rocks, such as peridotites, gabbros and anorthosite. The gabbro Santa Catarina was originally described by Rodrigues et al. (1982). The gabbro is in contact by fault with rocks of the Va-caca\u00ed Metamorphic Complex (Figure 1).\nGeologic Units\nCenozoic sediments\nZZ3\nParan\u00e1 Sedimentary Basin\nI' - iRio Bonito Formation\nCamaqua Sedimentary Basin\nI = = IHilario Formation\nlv-vlAcampamento Velho Formation\nIo * IMarica Group\nTardi-Pos Tectonic Granites\nI v v ISao Sepe Granite\n|Avft|Rincao dos Coqueiros Granite\nSupracrustals\nl-~-lBasic-Ultrabasic Stratiforms Rocks (Ped ras Pre tas massif, Santa Catarina gabbro)\nVacacai Metamorphic Complex I - vIMetavulcanossedimentary unit\nI---IMetassedimentary unity\nConventions\n----Contact\n1\u2014- Faul our Shear zone\n\u2014ili Bed with deep measure\na26 Foliation with deep measure\nAu* Gold occurence\nFederal Righway\n>-\u2014 Drainage\n\u25a1 Study Area ( Santa Catarina Gabbro\nThe Vacacai Metamorphic Com- canic, volcaniclastic and sedimentary plex comprises an association of vol- rocks, metamorphosed in the green\nFigure 1\nGeology of study area\n(Adapted from CPRM, 2000).\nschist grade, and phyllite, quartzite, marbles, hornblende schist and chlorite\nschist, along with magnesium sequences. This intrusive event is attributed to the Upper Proterozoic (CPRM, 1995).\nWhen characterized by a multiphase tectonic evolution in this unit, it is possible to discern four phases of deformation. The first three phases (D1, D2 and D3), generated folds with a tendency to axial coaxiality in the NE/ SW direction and are related to compressive stress directed to SE, where D1 and D2 reflect a tangential movement , while D3 is characterized as associated to a transcurrence phase. Meanwhile, the fourth phase of deformation (D4)\n2.\tMaterials and methods\nThe magnetometer used in this study was the nuclear precession or protons\nFigure 2 Scheme of data acquisition, with sampling points of current sediments and amount of gold particles\nThe lines were surface arranged in azimuthal array with the point of intersection coinciding approximately with the center of the gabbro, with a spacing of 20\u00b0 between rows and readings of magnetic susceptibility at 15m each, totaling 720 reading stations.

The deformation phase D2 resulted in a significant mass transport from northwest to southeast, evidenced by tectonic imbrications featuring structural arrangement between the various metamorphic associations in the region. The deformation phase D3 is responsible for the coaxial refolding and generation of folds of normal type,\nmagnetometer, model GSM-8 of Gem Systems.

The magnetic data were subjected to diurnal correction performed to eliminate the variations caused by non-geological causes; these changes that occur in the values recorded during the day, in the base magnetometer data in relation to\nwith moderate slope axes, now to NNE, then to SW. In general, these are open folds often of monoclinal trend with the hinge line inclined in from to NW. The folds generated in the D4 deformation phase are characterized by presenting axes with guidance close to orthogonality with respect to the structures established in the previous phases. They feature soft folds, of decimetric dimensions, represented by metamorphic foliation ripples, which constitute side folds, i.e. superimposed laminar folds of the structures of the previous stages (CPRM, 1995).\nwere performed with 1,200 m length each, a total of 10,800 m (Figure 2).\nmobile magnetometer. As the magnetic anomalies are disturbances or deviations from the terrestrial geomagnetic field, to define an anomaly, it is necessary to subtract the value of the normal field of each measure performed in the survey. In surveys performed in less extended areas, such as the study area, a single value of IGRF was obtained for the center of the area and subtracted from all measurements made.\nThe image of the amplitude of the\nanalytic signal determines geometric parameters such as the location of geological\n3.\tResults\nThe map of the total anomalous field presents great variation in values, with the presence of anomalies of elongated shape with higher magnetic susceptibility in the order of 22710 nT, whose areas with higher susceptibility portions are in NE, E, SW, W areas and intermediate values in N-S. These anomalous areas exhibit elongated shape with lateral continuity. Areas with lower magnetic intensity were also observed, with variation in the order of 22043 nT, whose most significant low values are located in the NW, SW and SE quadrants (Figure 3).\nThe elaboration of magnetometric maps was based on linear interpolation by the method of minimum curvature, resulting in a grid of cells of 15 m x 15 m. For the geographical location of the stations the Universal Transverse\nand structural limits, with the highlight of these structures. In this context, the\nMercator or UTM coordinates system, Zone 22 South was used. The reference ellipsoid used for this study was the SAD 69.\nFrom the total magnetometer field map, the processing technique was applied for enhancement of magnetic anomalies. In the transformation of the space domain to the time domain through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), a map of analytical signals was generated. In this map, the gabbro was characterized by high magnetic susceptibility, in contrast to the metassedi-ments of the Vacacai Metamorphic Complex. However, the ends of the map also present a high magnetic susceptibility, in this case, attributed geostatistical effects due to the absence and small quantity of sample points (Figure 3).

In the NE portion, where a more significant magnetic high in the order of 27.6 nT is observed, fractures are heading NE-SW, which reinforces the hypothesis of ore concentration in these lineaments.\n-H-\nMap of total field magnetometer (nT)\nFigure 3\nMap with the calculated values of total magnetic field in nT.\nFigure 4 Map of analytic signal, with that of the gabbro (solid line), and structural lineaments obtained from satellite images (dashed). The structures highlighted in white are related to D4 deformation phase.\nThe Vacacai Metamorphic Complex, fitting from the Santa Catarina gabbro is characterized by a multiphase tectonic evolution, where it is possible to discern four phases of deformation (D1, D2, D3 and D4).\nThe first three phases generated folds tending to coaxiality in a NE/ SW direction, related to compressive stress towards the SE. The D3 phase is characterized by strike-slip movement with coaxial refolding and generation of folds of normal type and slope axis to NNE and SW. The D4 phase resulted in folds with axial orientation NW/SE,\n4.\tConclusion\nThe image of the amplitudes of the analytic signal determines geometric parameters, such as the location of geological and structural limits. The analytic signal presents as its main feature the placement of the amplitudes arising immediately above the limits of the structure. These aspects are quite evident regarding the magnetometer signature of the intrusive rock, defined by high values\northogonal in relation to the structures established in the previous phases.\nThe gabbro Santa Catarina is understood as a structural basement horst, raised to its present position during the D3 stage by compressive stresses. The compressive stress of the D4 phase generated fractures in the main direction, in an event where there was low-grade metamorphism and probable gold remobilization from the metassediments to the gabbro (CPRM, 1995).\nThe geological context of the study area indicates that the mineralized zones must be contained in fractures. Thus,\nof magnetic susceptibility and quite close to the geological contact defined by geological mapping and field reconnaissance.\nIn this sense, processing through the analytical signal filter demonstrated efficacy as an auxiliary tool in the delimitation of mafic intrusives in metassedi-mentary contexts.\nThe evolutionary context of the study area is characterized by a polycyclic\nafter the application of the analytical signal filter, the generated map shows two zones of high magnetic susceptibility, one in the NE portion and another in the S portion, which can be interpreted as promising for the accumulation of gold and sulfides (Figure 3).\nThe areas with potential presence of mineralized veins in gold and sulfides cause large distortions in the local magnetic field, apparently in an amplitude higher than the distortion caused by the presence of disseminated magnetite along the forming minerals of the gabbro.\nevolution and high complexity, where four phases of deformation were defined. In the D3 phase, it is attributed to the rise of intrusive rock by the movement of normal faults, interpreted as a structural horst of basement, which was a seabed before sedimentation and subsequently, to the metamorphism of the lithotypes gathered in the Vacacai Metamorphic Complex, unit admittedly mineralized in gold.\nThe D4 deformation phase resulted in structural lineaments with NE and E-W directions, whose efforts may be related to both the fracturing and opening of spaces within the gabbro, and the remobilization of metals (gold and sulfides) derived from the metassedimentary host. Although the gabbro is a known magnetic rock because of the high content of magnetite, the analytic signal map outlines areas with high magnetic susceptibility within its boundaries, coinciding with structural lineaments in the NS and E-W directions. This fact can be attributed to the possible presence of veins of massive sulfide and gold, in\tcontrast to the occurrence of magnetite above the regional average.
