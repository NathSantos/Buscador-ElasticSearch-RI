Geomorphological and mineralogical records to characterize palaeosurfaces associate the weathering of primary\nminerals and their relationship with concentrations of cooper and iron ore deposits in southeastern state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. We have\ndistinguished two palaeosurfaces generated by several weathering phases and controlled by the geological framework. The first and oldest\nupper palaeosurfaces (900 \u2013 1000 m a.s.l.), situated in Riber\u00e3o Branco (Alto do Brancal), were developed on silico-limestones. It is\nformed by typical iron laterites enriched by secondary products of cooper. The second and younger level palaeosurfaces located in\nItapeva (Santa Blandina and Bairro do Sambra). This palaeosurface is formed by copper percolating through the weathered rock\n(saprolite). Other features can be observed like neo-formed products in laterites. They are classified into two types: clay like silico-\ncupriferous products (with noticeable amounts of iron) and copper minerals (crysocolla, in their flat slopes). These features allowed the\npresence of copper ores and their morphogenesis control will help in the exploration and prospecting of supergene ore mineral.\nKeyword: Palaeosurfaces, supergene copper, vale do Ribeira, Santa Blandina, Alto do Brancal, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\n\nRESUMO \u2013 L.F.B.

During certain\nmoments in Earth history, special sub-aerial and\nsupergene environments led to extreme geochemical\nseparation, enrichment or depletion of certain elements\n(Valenton, 1983, 1985; Melfi et al., 1979).\n\nElement stability during weathering processes\ndepends upon the bounding energy of the primary\nmineral, the different behavior of polyvalent elements\nin relation to Eh conditions and the chemical\ncomposition of the interstitial solution during\ndecomposition and neoformation. According to Valenton\n(1985), the mineral or element stability in the supergene\nlayer may be grouped as follows:\n\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, UNESP,  Geoci\u00eancias, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 520\n\n1. Those which are relativity stable in minerals like\nhematite (Fe), cassiterite (Sn), zircon (Zn) and gold\n(Au);\n\n2. Those with became enriched by neomineralization\n(layer silicates, Al, Ni, Cu);\n\n3. Neomineralization oxides and oxihidrates (Al, Mn,\nFe, Co, Ni) correlative to parent rocks\n\n4. Neomineralization of the carbonates, sulfates,\nphosphates and arsenates (Cu, P, Al);\n\n5. Supergene minerals or element concentration is\nrelated to morphology and topography.\nThe Santa Blandina cupriferous mineralization is\n\nconstituted by a weathered skarnite. It is formed by\nsupergenous concentration of copper and residual laterites\nenrichment of iron and copper. This mineralization is a\ncase example for the studies and mechanisms of\naccumulation of supergene copper.  Previous studies\ncarried out in the area by Creach (1988) and Creach et\n\nLOCATION  AND  GEOLOGICAL  SETTING\n\nal. (1991, 1992) characterized the copper supergenous\naccumulation, both from a mineralogical viewpoint, as\nwell as in cristalochemistry.  From such studies it may\nbe concluded that, during the weathering process, copper\nwas liberated from the structure of the primary sulphites.\nConsequently, these primary sulphites were\nincorporated to the infiltrating solution that took part in\nthe alteration of the escarnites and the whole-rock\nlimestone, and in the elaboration of the secondary\nphases (carbonates, oxides and silicates).  The copper\nis found associated in the silicate phase, constituted by\nesmectites and interstratified with kaolinites- esmectites\nand crysocolla (Creach et al., 1992).\n\nThis work intends to contribute upon the relation\nof the palaeosurfaces with the distribution and genesis\nof the supergenous deposits and iron/copper laterite\nprofiles in the Itapeva (S\u00e3o Paulo) region and adjacent\nareas.\n\nThe research area is located in the southern region\nof the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, between the Guapiara,\nItapeva and Riber\u00e3o Branco areas (Figure 1).  The\nmain routes in the study area are the Presidente Castelo\nBranco highway (SP-280) from Sorocaba and the\nRaposos Tavares highway (SP-270) from Itapetininga.\nThere are other routes like SP-127 from Cap\u00e3o Bonito\nand SP-258 to Itapeva (S\u00e3o Paulo) that provide access\nto the area.\n\nThe study area is included in the southern segment\nof the Mantiqueira Tectonic Province, dominated by\nstructures related to the Neoproterozoic Brasiliano/Pan\nAfrican Orogeny from 640 to 480 Ma (Cordani et al.,\n2000; Heilbron et al., 2000, 2004). The geological\nframework is dominated by several long NE trending\nfault zones, which separate many tectonic blocks. It\ncontains Mesoproterozoic (ca. 1,750-1,450 Ma) and\nNeoproterozoic supracrustal sequences (ca. 800-600\nMa) revealing a polycyclic evolution (Cordani et al.,\n2000; Basei et al., 2009).\n\nThe area comprises the Apia\u00ed Folded Belt (AFB),\nwhich is a domain of the southern portion of the Ribeira\nBelt. In the Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo states, southern\nBrazil, it is composed of met volcanic-sedimentary\nrocks, of low to medium metamorphic grade, grouped\nin the A\u00e7ungui Supergroup (Campanha and Sadowski,\n1999). The Neoproterozoic granitic rocks are\nrepresented by the Cunhaporanga, Tr\u00eas C\u00f3rregos and\n\nAgudos Grandes batholiths which intrude the\nsupracrustal rocks. Both groups are affected by latter\ngranitic stocks (Corr\u00eaas, Sambra and Itaoca granite).\nIn the study areas of Santa Blandina and Alto do\nBrancal (Figure 1), the rocks have undergone intense\nmineralization process associated with a syn tectonic\ngranitic batholith. This granitic batholith is in contact\nzone with limestone lenses which caused the skarnite\ngeneration (Arruda, 1971). The metassomatic process\nled to cupper remobilization and concentration in the\nskarnite zone, in the shape of pockets and veins with\nsulfide, chalcopyrite and bornite. This mineralization\nzone extends for 400 meters long by 150 meters and is\nflanked by metasedimentary and amphibolitic rocks\n(Creach et al., 1991, 1992).\n\nThe Paran\u00e1 Basin sequence area formed by\nconglomerates ans sandstones rocks of the Itarar\u00e9\ngroup and siltites correlated of the Furnas Fm.These\nsequences were tilted and the surface was uplifted,\npartly eroded and  unconformably overlain by a thick\nsequence (~1500 m) of Early Cretaceous Paran\u00e1\ncontinental flood basalts (Renne et al., 1992, 1996). In\nsome parts, the area chracterized by these lithologies  is\ncut by basic dykes, mostly with a NW, and rarely with a\nNE, direction, associated to the Guapiara alignment. The\nfault reactivation effects caused deep changes in the\ndrainage network pattern, the palaeosurfaces and the\ndissection of the copper deposits.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\nA general topographical overview for a preliminary\n\nstudy, based on field work and digital elevation data,\nwas obtained. Large-scale landforms in the study area\nwere identified using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM)\n\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, UNESP, Geoci\u00eancias, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 521\n\nFIGURE 1.   Study area (Modified after Daitx, 1996).\n\nimported by ArcGIS software. The large-scale\nlandforms have been analyzed by the major\nmorphological elements: the drainage network pattern\nand the palaeosurfaces distribution. The DEM was used\nto construct a model of distribution and height of the\nplateau remnants above sea level.\n\nLandform analysis was carried out in a digital\nelevation model (DEM) in a 50x50 meters resolution\nsquare grid, constructed by topographic maps. Based\non the given information of the study area, the analysis\n\nwas applied according to the methods developed for\nmapping and recognizing these landforms postulated\nby King (1956), Twidale (1997), and Granell-P\u00e9rez\n(2004). In this map, altitudes of the palaeosurfaces and\nvalleys were identified through the numerical\ndigitalization of various topographic contours.\n\nA general topographical overview was obtained\nby a study based on field work and digital elevation\ndata (Ribeiro, 2008) and the description of landforms\nin the southeastern part of the study area by taken\n\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, UNESP,  Geoci\u00eancias, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 522\n\nfrom Arruda (1971) and Pon\u00e7ano et al. (1981).\nAfter this procedure, the landforms were analyzed\n\nin several steps. Firstly, a surface/slope map of the\nsouthern study area was designed. Areas with slope\nangles less than 6.5\u00b0 were defined as palaeosurfaces,\nextracted and colored according to height above sea\nlevel. After the elimination of flat valley bottoms at\nhigh and medium elevations, the final map with flat\npalaeosurface levels was obtained. These\npalaeosurface levels were constructed on closed\ntopographic contours representing restricted summits.\nThe mapping resulted in a description of the several\npalaeosurface levels and the identification of fault\nblocks.\n\nPalaeosurface levels could be interpreted in\ndifferent ways: as indicators of river-dissected,\ndenudation surfaces or as the result of the interaction\nof the climate stability. The analysis of the landforms\n\nin the study area resulted in the identification of two\nplanation surfaces at higher elevations. The first\npalaeosurface level is situated at 660-720 m a.s.l. on\nthe low lying block to the north of the Sambra and\nSanta Blandina areas and it has undergone deeper\nerosion than other areas nearby. Another palaeosurface\nlevel was mapped at 860-920 m a.s.l. on the higher\nblock of the Alto do Brancal area (Figure 1) but it has\nnot suffered as deep erosion as the other palaeosurface\nrecognized before.\n\nThe morphological description of the paleosols\nfollowed the procedure proposed by Thomas (1994),\nWiddowson (1997) and Twidale (2002) and the soil\nterminology by Ollier (1991). In Figure 2, surface\ndeposits were recognized, by means of the soil\ndescription in profile, which consisted in the construction\nin profiles of the soils and paleosols found on the mapped\npalaeosurfaces.\n\nFIGURE 2.  Typical textbook illustration of a laterite profile (modified after Ollier, 1991);\nRock structure is usually preserved in the saprolite and mottled zones indicate\nthat these zones consist of in situ weathered rock with no volume alteration.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThrough our investigations in the study area, we\ncan state that it underwent a distinct series of cyclic\nevents characterized by phases of deep weathering,\nwhere the accommodation space was provided by large\nscale tectonic deformation, alternating with periods\nduring which the supergene deposits were firstly\nuplifted and then dissected.\n\nAfter cartographic recognition, fieldwork was\nconducted and the palaeosurfaces that characterize\nthese areas were recognized, namely:\n\nThe first palaeosurface level represented in the\nmap by a  red color was recognized in the northern\narea, near Itapeva (SP) (Sambra and Santa Brandina\nareas) with elevations ranging from 660 to 720 m a.s.l.,\n\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, UNESP, Geoci\u00eancias, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 523\n\ndeveloped on the Furnas Formation and the Itaiacoca\nGroup. It is comprised by granite and limestone,\nrespectively (Theodorovicz et al. 1988), with the\npresence of two diabase dykes, highly fractured and\naltered to Oxisols with the presence of esmectites,\nkaolinites and goethite. In this palaeosurface level, it\nwas observed that the distribution of hills is highly\ndependent on density of joints and fractures and it is\nknown that deep weathering is favored by structural\nweaknesses in bedrock and it enhances landform\n\npatterns controlled by fractures and joints. This is\nrepresented by the reddish color related to Oxisols\n(Figures 3 and 4).\n\nThe second palaeosurface level is located in the\nsouthern area (Figure 3, yellow colored area), in the\nAlto do Brancal (Ribeir\u00e3o Branco county) with the\naltitudes ranging between 860-920 m (Figure 4). In the\npalaeosurface level, two laterites phases interspersed\nwith sand paleosols were recognized, which allowed\nconsidering this as the oldest surface.\n\nFIGURE 4.  A) Outcrop showing laterite profile with paleosols at the base and buried sandy. Oxisoils,\nRibeir\u00e3o Branco road Alto do Brancal (right lane); B) Profile corresponding to the section\n\nshown in the photograph. Figures represent thickness of each layer.\n\nFIGURE 3.

Figures represent the thickness of each layer.\n\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, UNESP,  Geoci\u00eancias, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 524\n\nIn the area where the Second Palaeosurface level\nwas observed during field work, the distribution of hills\nis highly dependent on the relative density of joints and\nfractures.\n\nThe landform analysis in the second palaeosurface\nlevel led to the identification of a higher and well\npreserved surface flat level, particularly well developed\nin the northeastern part of the study area. It was\nobserved that the palaeosurface level distribution is\ndependent upon the host rock weathering and its\nresistance rate, which is affected by the velocity and\nchanges in the chemical and mineralogical alteration\nand the geological and geomorphological factors. These\nmechanisms forced deep weathering due to changes\nin landform patterns controlled by fractures and joints,\nthus generating residual copper deposits.\n\nIn the northern area, where the palaeosurfaces (red\narea in Figure 5) were developed on basalts, they are\nforming oxisols and, where they formed on the Furnas\n\nFm. sandstones, rare sandy soils These sandy soils are\noverlying a profile change of almost 25 meters thick\n(Creach et al., 1991) that corresponds to the saprolite\nwith argilomorphic products (Kaolinitte, montmorilonite\nand smectite) and large amounts of chrysocolla. These\ndeposits were formed by the action of the in situ changes\nand the drainage (Figure 2 and Figure 6 A, B).\n\nIn the southern area where the second\npalaeosurface is located (yellow areas in Figure 5),\nthe laterites are a large iron ore deposit formed by two-\nlevel laterite formation. Analyzing the profile of the\nFigure 6 C, it can be seen that there is a small copper\ndeposit in this area, located on the lower slope, but at a\nmuch higher altitude than in previous instances, which\nis represented only by oxidized copper minerals (azurite,\nmalachite). Azurite occurs in the rock and also features\nin the laterite profile therefore the migration of copper\nwas from the rock to the saprolite zone, but only iron\nmigrated to the surface forming laterite profile.\n\nFIGURE 5.  Digital elevation model showing the two palaeosurface levels\n(red and yellow levels) and copper occurrences (black areas) in the studied region.\n\nAbbreviations: Pi:  pyrite; Fe: iron; Az: azurite; Ba: barite; Cpi: Chalcopyrite; Ma: Malachite; Cri: Crysocolla.\n\n\n\nS\u00e3o Paulo, UNESP, Geoci\u00eancias, v. 29,  n. 4, p. 519-526, 2010 525\n\nFIGURE 6.  Topographic profiles with the distribution of copper\noccurrences in the Itapeva and Ribeir\u00e3o Branco areas (SP).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe combined results of the geomorphological and\nchemical analyses (Ribeiro, 2009), together with the\nsoil description in the studied areas, allow the following\nconclusions:\n\nPalaeosurface level 1 is the lowest level and a\nlarger occurrence of rock alteration has been\npreserved there (25 m of saprolite horizon), together\nwith the presence of silicate minerals, such as\nchrysocolla and clays. Copper was accumulated in\nthe cementation zone in the form of chrysocolla and\nmalachite. In this profile, Fe has accumulated\n\nresidually forming an iron hat, nowadays partially\nremoved and modified.\n\nPalaeosurfaces level 2 is the higher of the two\npreserved levels. It presents in situ lateritic horizons\nshowing two overlapping climate phases, which are\nindicated by traces of copper in the saprolite. The\nmigration of iron to the residual area occurs with the\nconcomitant elimination by leaching and hydrolysis of\nthe oxidized zone, which defined the boundaries of the\nextension reaction (alteration haloes), with outcropping\nazurite and other oxidized copper ores.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\nThe authors wish to thank FAPESP/PIPE (processes: 2006/60795-3 and 2007/56318) for financial support within the Project entitled\n\n\u201cAplica\u00e7\u00e3o da termocronologia como ferramenta para o aux\u00edlio na pesquisa e prospec\u00e7\u00e3o de dep\u00f3sitos de min\u00e9rio hidrotermais e sup\u00e9rgenos\u201d.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHIC  REFERENCES\n\n1.
