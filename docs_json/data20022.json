Se por \num lado, os filtros devem conter uma estrutura de elevada porosidade \naberta; em contrapartida, esses materiais devem apresentar resist\u00eancia \n\nmec\u00e2nica suficiente para suportar a queda de press\u00e3o durante o processo \nde filtra\u00e7\u00e3o. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar a viabilidade de \nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de tubos porosos, em comp\u00f3sitos de matriz cer\u00e2mica e \n\nmet\u00e1lica refor\u00e7ados por fibras, via extrus\u00e3o termopl\u00e1stica de p\u00f3s, para \naplica\u00e7\u00e3o em processos de filtra\u00e7\u00e3o.

Fibras curtas de alumina foram utilizadas \ncomo refor\u00e7o. Como componentes do sistema ligante foram utilizados \n\npolietileno de baixa densidade (LDPE), parafina (PW) e \u00e1cido este\u00e1rico \n(SA). Diferentes propor\u00e7\u00f5es entre LDPE-PW-SA foram estudadas a fim \n\nde desenvolver um sistema ligante apropriado ao processo. A evolu\u00e7\u00e3o \nda viscosidade da mistura em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do teor de s\u00f3lidos foi estudada e \ncomparada a diversos modelos de viscosidade. Ap\u00f3s o desenvolvimento \n\ndo feedstock de extrus\u00e3o, 30 % em volume de fibras foram adicionadas \na mistura. Tubos com 4,5 a 10,0 mm de di\u00e2metro, com 0,6 e 1,0 mm de \nespessura foram ent\u00e3o extrudados com sucesso, ap\u00f3s sucessivas etapas \n\nde ajuste dos par\u00e2metros de extrus\u00e3o.

On one hand filters must contain a \nhighly open porous structure; on the other hand these materials must \nhave sufficient mechanical strength to withstand the pressure drop \n\nduring the filtration process. The objective of this work was to study the \nfeasibility to produce short fiber reinforced porous ceramic and metal \nmatrix composites tubes, processed by powder thermoplastic extrusion, \n\nfor application in filtering processes. The powder thermoplastic \nextrusion is a continuous process, able to promote high alignment of \n\nfibers in the extrusion direction, without excessive fiber breakage. \nAlumina and nickel superalloy powders have been selected to form the \nmatrix of the ceramic and metallic matrix composites, respectively. \n\nShort alumina fibers have been used as reinforcement. Low density \npolyethylene (LDPE), paraffin wax (PW) and stearic acid (SA) formed \nthe binder system. Different proportions of LDPE-PW-SA have been \n\nstudied in order to develop a binder system suitable for the extrusion \nprocess. The evolution of the feedstock viscosity as a function of the \n\nsolids content was studied and compared to various viscosity models. \nAfter the development of the extrusion feedstock, 30 vol.% of fibers \nwere incorporated to the mixture. Tubes with 4.5 and 10.0 mm of \n\ndiameter, with 0.6 and 1.0 mm of thickness, were then successfully \nextruded, after the complete extrusion parameters adjustment. \nMicroscopy analysis confirmed the satisfactory fiber alignment. Finally, \n\nafter sintering the tubes at 1300 \u00b0C for 60 minutes, meso and \nmacroporosity were identified by mercury intrusion porosimetry \nanalysis, with a total pore volume of, approximately, 41 and 36 % in the \n\nceramic and metal matrix composites, respectively. The porosity level, \nas well as the average pore size, have been considered adequate for the \n\napplication in certain filtration processes, particularly in hot-gas \nfiltration. \n \n\nKeywords: Extrusion.

INTRODUCTION \n\nPorous materials, more specifically interconnected porous \nmaterials, are used in several applications, in particular filtering. \n\nExamples of filtering process are the water purification, oil filtration, \naerosols filtration, hot-gas filtration and molten metal filtration \n(FERNANDO, et al., 2002; FERNANDO, et al., 2005; STUDART, et \n\nal., 2006). Filtration is a very important process for several fields, in \nparticular for the petrochemical, mining and chemical industries \n(FERNANDO, et al., 2005). \n\nFor its application to be successfully attended, a porous material \nused for filtering must fulfill the following requirements (DUO, et al., \n\n1999): \n\ni. Presence of an interconnected porous network; \nii. Pore size distribution according to the size of the filtered \n\nparticulate; \niii. Permeability to the filtered fluid; \niv. Sufficient mechanical strength to withstand the fluid \n\npressure drop; \nv. Thermal resistance to withstand high temperatures, up to \n\n1000 \u00b0C, in the case of hot-gas filtration; \nvi. Corrosion and oxidation resistance. \n\nOn one hand these materials must contain high open porosity, \naccording to the application, on the other hand, high mechanical \n\nstrength is also required for the component to withstand the pressure \ndrop imposed by the filtering process. \n\nThe introduction of short fibers is an intelligent solution to \n\nimprove the mechanical strength, without jeopardizing the permeability \nof the component. In the search of appropriate materials for the \n\nproduction of porous components, short fibers were found to be good \nprecursors for membranes used in hot-gas and aerosols filtration \n(FERNANDO, et al., 2005). \n\nOne way to optimize the utilization of fibers is to align them in \nthe direction of the highest tensile strain imposed to the component. It is \nwell known that powder injection molding (PIM) and powder extrusion \n\nhave the ability to align short fibers in the direction of the viscous flux \nof the material (CHAWLA, et al., 2006; YE, et al., 2008). The \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\nalignment is parallel in contracting flow and perpendicular in expanding \n\nflow (YE, et al., 2008). The same benefit can be obtained by the powder \nthermoplastic extrusion. \n\nThe fiber alignment achieved by extrusion processes is one of the \nreasons why this route was chosen to produce short fibers reinforced \nporous tubes. Furthermore this process shows other important \n\nadvantages such as: \n\ni. Fiber length maintenance (fiber breaking occurs only \nduring the mixing step); \n\nii. Possibility to produce thin wall tubes without shape \ncollapse; \n\niii. It is a continuous process, which is a very important \nissue for industry in terms of time and process \nvariability; \n\niv. Possibility to produce components with a high \nlength/thickness ratio. \n\nIn the present work alumina short fibers were added to alumina \n\npowder and a nickel based alloy powder, to produce ceramic matrix \ncomposite (CMC) and metal matrix composite (MMC) porous tubes, \n\nrespectively. The idea was to validate a process that could suit several \ndifferent applications in which ceramic or metallic filters are required. \n\nNextel\n\u2122\n\n 610 alumina fibers were chosen due to purity and \n\navailability at the EMPA laboratory where this project was carried out. \nAlumina powder was chosen for its well known thermal and chemical \nstability, adequate for filtering applications (FERNANDO, et al., 2002). \n\nThe IN718 nickel superalloy was chosen for its high thermal and \ncorrosion resistance. \n  \n\n\n\n37 \n\n \n\n1.1.

COMPOSITES \n\nComposite materials comprise any material that has at least two \n\nchemically or physically distinct phases. The combination of the two \ndifferent phases usually provides  a combination of properties that \ncannot be obtained by the components individually (CHAWLA, et al., \n\n2006). The continuous phase is the matrix, while the distributed phase is \nthe reinforcement, which can be in the form of particles, whiskers, fibers \nor laminate (CHAWLA, 2003) as shown in Figure 1. \n\n \nFigure 1 \u2013 Classification of composites according to the reinforcement form. \nSource: Chawla (2003). \n\nBoth matrix and reinforcement can be polymeric, ceramic or \nmetallic. According to the matrix material is convenient to separate the \n\ncomposites into three groups: polymer matrix composites (PMC\u2019s), \nceramic matrix composites (CMCs) and metal matrix composites \n(MMCs) (CHAWLA, 2003). \n\nNormally a composite performs its function as far as the fiber is \nloaded via fiber/matrix interface. Therefore the interface in composites \nhas so much importance (MILEIKO, 1997). \n\nIn a composite, there are two types of bonding at the interface of \nmatrix and reinforcement, mechanical and chemical bonding. In PMC\u2019s \nand MMCs it is important that both types of bonding are present, in a \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nway that the load can be transmitted from the weaker matrix to the \n\ntypically stiffer reinforcement. Whereas for CMCs mechanical bonding \nis more desirable than chemical bonding so that a series of fracture \n\nmechanisms such as crack-bridgind, crack deflection, fiber fracture and \nfiber pull-out can take place. The energy consumed in these fracture \nmechanisms leads to an enhanced fracture toughness and a non-\n\ncatastrophic failure mode (CHAWLA, 2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006). \nThe main advantage of CMCs and MMCs have in common, in \n\ncomparison with PMC\u2019s, are the higher temperature ranges that these \n\nmaterials can be submitted (CHAWLA, et al., 2006). \nA metal matrix composite has usually a ductile matrix. The most \n\nefficient fibers are graphite, boron, carbides, and oxides, which are \nbrittle. In the case of ceramic matrix composites, usually both matrix \nand fibers are brittle (MILEIKO, 1997). \n\nThis work relates with short alumina fibers reinforced CMCs and \nMMCs. The characteristic of such materials will be described in the \nfollowing sections. \n\nA big variety of processing routes are available to produce CMCs \nand MMCs such as (CHAWLA, 2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006; \n\nGERMAN, 1990; SURESH, et al., 1993; CHOU, et al., 1985): \n\ni. Cold pressing and sintering; \nii. Hot pressing; \n\niii. Injection molding; \niv. Conventional extrusion; \nv. Forging; \n\nvi. Rolling; \nvii. Reaction and diffusion bonding; \n\nviii. Casting or liquid infiltration; \nix. Squeeze casting or pressure infiltration; \nx. Spray co-deposition \n\nxi. Direct oxidation \u2013 Lanxide\u2122 process; \nxii. In-situ chemical reaction techniques; \n\nxiii. Sol-gel; \nxiv. Polymer infiltration and pyrolysis \u2013 PIP; \nxv. Self-propagation high temperature synthesis \u2013 SHS; \n\nxvi. Electrophoretic deposition; \nxvii. Explosive shock consolidation; \n\n\n\n41 \n\n \n\nCompared with these processes, thermoplastic powder extrusion \n\nfeatures two main advantages regarding the processing of fibrous \ncomposites. First it is a process, like others related feedstock processing \n\nroutes, which induces fiber alignment (GERMAN, 1990; SHENOY, \n1999; CALOW, et al., 1972). The fiber alignment can be good to tailor \nproperties such as strength and creep resistance in a preferential \n\ndirection (CALOW, et al., 1971). Figure 2 shows schematically the \nconcept of fiber alignment obtained with PIM processing. \n\n \nFigure 2 \u2013 Schematic diagram showing fiber alignment due to contracting and \n\nexpanding flow during injection or feedstock extrusion process. \n\nSource: German (1990). \n\nFiber alignment is not an exclusivity of feedstock processing, \nother routes including conventional extrusion, rolling, forging and \n\nsqueeze casting may also grant an oriented microstructure (CHAWLA, \net al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993). Figure 3 shows a quantitative \n\nanalysis of the degree of orientation of SiC particles in a conventionally \nextruded MMC. \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \nFigure 3 \u2013 Quantitative analysis of the degree of orientation of SiC particles in \n\nan extruded 2080 aluminum alloy matrix composite with 20 vol.% of \nreinforcement fraction. The degree of orientation is defined by the angle of a \n\ngiven article to loading axis. \nSource: Chawla, et al (2006). \n\nHowever, because of the high strains associated with process \nsuch as rolling, forging and conventional extrusion, fracture of short \n\nfibers and even particles take place, which can be detrimental to the \nproperties of the composite (CHAWLA, et al., 2006). The fracture of \nfibers leads to the second advantage of feedstock processing, e.g. \n\nthermoplastic powder extrusion, because due to the low viscosity of the \nfeedstock at molding temperatures, both fibers and particles are \n\nsubjected to lower strains, as compared with conventional extrusion, \nwhich avoids fiber breaking (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nThe breaking of fiber is acceptable until the fibers reaches a \n\nminimum length at which it is still effective, i.e. contributes to increase \nthe strength and stiffness of the composite. This length is called critical \n\nlength lc, and depends on the fiber diameter df, the fiber strength ?f* and \n\non the interface shear strength ?i*, according to Equation 1 (MILEIKO, \n1997; CALLISTER, 2006; CALOW, et al., 1972). \n\n\n\n43 \n\n \n\nEquation 1    \n  \n\n   \n\n   \n  \n\n2.1.1. Alumina based fibers as reinforcement \n\nCeramic fibers are very attractive for reinforcement of both \n\nCMCs and MMCs. They combine high strength, high modulus, \nchemical resistance, high temperature capabilities, being ideal \ncandidates for high temperature applications (CHAWLA, 2003). \n\nDue to the small cross section and large aspect ratio, ceramic \nfibers have two very important features: their high degree of flexibility \nand higher strength than the bulk material of the same composition \n\n(CHAWLA, 2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006). \nA big problem of high temperature applications is the oxidation \n\nwhen the material is exposed to oxidizing atmosphere (LEV, et al., \n1995). Carbon fibers oxidizes easily at temperatures above 400 \u00b0C. \nSilicon carbide (SiC) fibers are also prone to oxidation at temperatures \n\nhigher than 1200 \u00b0C (CHAWLA, 2003). A solution to the oxidation \nproblem demands the use of oxide fibers (LEV, et al., 1995). Oxide \nfibers are available since 1970s and have been thoroughly investigated \n\n(CHAWLA, 2003). \nAmong the oxides, alumina is one of the most stable in a variety \n\nof environments, although its melting point, 2050 \u00b0C, is not one of the \nhighest. Its thermodynamically stable phase is the hexagonal ?-Al2O3 \n(CHAWLA, 2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006), which the structure is \nshown on Figure 4. \n\n\n\n44 \n \n\n \nFigure 4 \u2013 Hexagonal close-packed \n\nstructure of ?-alumina. \nSource: Chawla (2003). \n\n \nSince decades many companies produce in high scale \n\npolycrystalline alumina fibers, being the fibers produced by Du Pont, \n\nSumitomo Chemical Co., and 3M Co. (formerly known as Minnesota \nMining and Manufacturing Co.) among the most commercialized \n(CHAWLA, 2003). \n\nThe highest performance fibers that are now available in adequate \nquantities and at reasonable cost are fine-grained high-purity alumina \n\n(Nextel\u2122 610) and alumina/mullite (Nextel\u2122 720) fibers produced by \nthe 3M Co. The Nextel\u2122 610 has the highest strength (~3.3 GPa) and \nhigher corrosion resistance, while the Nextel\u2122 720 shows better creep \n\nresistance, being stable at higher temperatures, 1200 \u00b0C for Nextel\u2122 \n720 against 1100 \u00b0C for The Nextel\u2122 610 (MARSHALL, et al., 2001). \n\nTable 1 shows the data of some of the commercially available \n\nalumina fibers. \n  \n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Data of some commercial alumina fibers.

Above \n\nthis temperature the properties of the fibers reduces due to degradation \n(LEE, et al., 2003). \n\n2.1.2. Metal matrix composites \n\nMetal matrix composites development has been impelled by some \nadvantages with respect to unreinforced metals. Comparing with the \nanalog unreinforced metal, MMCs may enhance the following \n\nproperties (CHAWLA, et al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993): \n\ni. Specific strength; \nii. Specific modulus; \n\niii. Dimensional stability; \niv. Reduced coefficient of thermal expansion; \nv. Creep resistance; \n\nvi. Fatigue resistance; \nvii. Wear resistance; \n\nviii. Isotropy. \n\nWhen compared with CMCs, metal matrix composites have as \n\nadvantage higher thermal, electrical conductivity and fracture toughness \n(SURESH, et al., 1993; CHAWLA, 2003). \n\nExamples of metals commonly used as the matrix on composites \n\nare: aluminum and aluminum alloys, titanium alloys, magnesium and \nmagnesium alloys, cobalt, iron and iron alloys, copper, silver, nickel and \nnickel alloys, including nickel superalloys, niobium, and intermetallics\n\n1\n \n\n(CHAWLA, et al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993). \nFor high temperature applications the matrix systems are mainly \n\nnickel-, niobium-, and cobalt-based alloys, as well as intermetallics. The \n\nMMCs with these matrix systems are developed for applications at \ntemperatures over 800 \u00b0C (SURESH, et al., 1993). \n\n                                                         \n1\n The chemical bond in intermetallics is actually not metallic, but ionic or covalent in nature. \n\nIntermetallics are formed when two dissimilar metals are combined following chemical \n\nvalence rules, i.e. ionic or covalent rules (CHAWLA, et al., 2006). \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nThe two main routes to produce MMCs are via liquid state \n\nprocessing and solid state processing. The advantages of the solid state \nprocessing, which is mostly based on powder metallurgy techniques, is \n\nthe control of reinforcement distribution, uniformity of matrix \nmicrostructure, and lower degree of interfacial reaction between matrix \nand reinforcement which can be detrimental to the reinforcement \n\n(CHAWLA, et al., 2006). \nIncreasingly MMCs are used in several areas including \n\naerospace, automotive and railway industries; electronics; thermal \n\nmanagement; filamentary superconducting magnets; power \ntransmission; sporting goods; and wear-resistant materials (CHAWLA, \n\net al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993). \n\n2.1.2.1. Alumina fibers reinforced nickel based composites \n\nThe study and development of alumina reinforced nickel based \n\ncomposites was driven the high temperature and oxidation resistance of \nnickel alloys and the availability of alumina whiskers. A promising \napplication for such composites was high temperature turbine blades. \n\nHowever problems with thermal expansion compatibility (see Table 2), \nwhiskers degradation and weak interface bond made retarded the \n\ndevelopment of these composites (CALOW, et al., 1972; CALOW, et \nal., 1971; MILEIKO, 1997; MILEIKO, et al., 2004). \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Coefficients of thermal expansion of nickel and alumina. \n\nMaterial \nCoefficient of thermal expansion (\u00b0C\n\n-1\n) \n\nat 373 K at 1273 K \n\nNi 13.25 x 10\n-6\n 16.50 x 10\n\n-6\n \n\nAl2O3 6.00 x 10\n-6\n\n 8.20 x 10\n-6\n\n \n\nSource: Calow, et al (1972). \n\nChemical interaction between fiber and matrix is inevitable if \n\nthere is no thermodynamic equilibrium between them. The consequence \nwill be an interface region containing substances with properties \n\ndifferent from the matrix and fiber (MILEIKO, 1997). \nNevertheless difficulties on predicting and avoiding those \n\ninteractions arise for many reasons. First because phase diagrams of \n\n\n\n48 \n \n\ncomplex systems elements used in MMCs are unknown. Secondly the \n\nkinetics cannot be described without experiments. Thirdly the influence \nof the interface on the properties of the composite can be varied and \n\ndepends on the type of load (MILEIKO, 1997). \nFor systems forming interfaces, such as Ni and Al2O3, it is \n\nimportant to predict those product phases formed by diffusion bonding \n\nduring sintering. However, even if all the thermodynamic data are \nknown, it is still hard to determine which phases will be present in the \ninterface. In the case of the system Ni-Al-O, two different situations can \n\nexists, as shown in Figure 5. In high vacuum conditions, with activity of \noxygen under 10\n\n-12\n, the diffusion path (path I) follows the side of an \n\naluminum rich phase, poor in oxygen, and no product phase is formed. \nOn the other hand, if the activity of oxygen is higher, the diffusion path \nfollows the tie line that connects the nickel and the spinel (path II), and \n\nspinel is formed (SURESH, et al., 1993). For pure nickel matrix, \nsubstantial amount of spinel nickel aluminate, NiAl2O4, can form above \n1100 \u00b0C (CALOW, et al., 1971). \n\n \nFigure 5 \u2013 Ni-Al-O isothermal phase diagram at 1600 K. \n\nTwo reaction paths are possible when nickel is bonded to \nAl2O3. (I) low oxygen activity, no reaction product form. \n\n(II) high oxygen activity, spinel forms. \n\nSource: Suresh, et al (1993). \n\n\n\n49 \n\n \n\nOne of the consequences of the interaction between the ceramic \n\nfiber and the metal matrix is the degradation of the fiber, leading to \nreduction of fiber strength. Degradation of alumina reinforcement in a \n\nnickel-based matrix has been reported (MILEIKO, 1997; MILEIKO, et \nal., 2002a; CALOW, et al., 1971; CALOW, et al., 1972). Table 3 shows \nthe critical temperature Tc and time of exposure in the critical \n\ntemperature tc in which sapphire whiskers, i.e. monocrystalline alumina, \nstarts to degrade in the presence of different nickel-based matrix. \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Stability of alumina whiskers in nickel-based matrices. \n\nMatrix tc (h) Tc (\u00b0C) \n\nNi&lt;1 1000 \n\n80Ni \u2013 20Cr&lt;1 1000 \n\nNi-Cr-Fe&lt;16 1000 \n\nSource: Mileiko (1997) \n\nThere are three possibilities to avoid such interactions and \ndegradation of the alumina fibers. The first obvious possibility is not to \nsubmit the MMC to a long-term exposure at high temperatures during \n\nfabrication, what would lead to low densification. The second possibility \nis matrix alloying; introducing alloying elements on the nickel matrix \n\nreduces its interaction with fibers, what has been already experimentally \ndemonstrated with elements such as chromium, aluminum, \nmolybdenum, tungsten, and cobalt (MILEIKO, 1997; MILEIKO, et al., \n\n2002a; CALOW, et al., 1971). Another advantage of alloying the nickel \nmatrix is the reduction of sintering temperature. Pure nickel sintering \ntemperatures are between 1300 and 1350 \u00b0C (CALOW, et al., 1972; \n\nJOHNSON, et al., 2004). Nevertheless is worthy to mention that \nsintering of highly porous nickel components, with porosity up to 80 %, \ncan be obtained by sintering loose carbonyl nickel powder at \n\ntemperatures between 850 and 1050 \u00b0C (ASM International, 2000). \nThe third option to minimize degradation lies on the use of \n\ndiffusion barriers, avoiding the direct contact between fiber and matrix. \nExamples of diffusion barriers for nickel matrix composites are HfO2, \nY2O3, TiC, ZiN, and HfC. Alumina coated with Y2O3-W-Ni has been \n\nalso reported (MILEIKO, 1997). \nIf on one hand reaction between the metal matrix and alumina \n\nfiber can be detrimental to the final properties of the composite, on the \n\nother hand, as mentioned in the previous section, a minimum of \n\n\n\n50 \n \n\nchemical interaction is required for MMCs to guarantee a proper load \n\ntransfer from matrix to the fibers. Following this approach the formation \nof a complex oxide AlxMyOz at the interface, where M is an alloying \n\nelement of the nickel matrix, might be also desirable (MILEIKO, et al., \n2002a). Some alloying elements, e.g. chromium, improve the bond \nstrength without though causing chemical reaction (CALOW, et al., \n\n1971). \nTests has shown that nickel alloys reinforced with different \n\nalumina based fibers have higher creep resistance than any available \n\nnon-reinforced nickel superalloys (MILEIKO, et al., 2002b; MILEIKO, \net al., 2004). The potential for such composites is the use at \n\ntemperatures up to 1200 \u00b0C (MILEIKO, 2002). \n\n2.1.2.2. Nickel superalloys \n\nAs mentioned in the previous section, alloying the nickel matrix \n\nis one of the possible approaches to minimize fiber-matrix detrimental \ninteractions (MILEIKO, 1997). Nickel based superalloys are well \nknown for its high temperature strength and resistance. However, nickel \n\nbased superalloys limiting temperature is below 1100 \u00b0C. The only way \nto enhance the use temperature of such alloys is reinforcing them with \n\ncreep-resistant ceramic fibers (MILEIKO, et al., 2002a; MILEIKO, et \nal., 2002b). \n\nSuperalloys are the class of heat-resisting alloys based on nickel, \n\nnickel-iron, or cobalt. These alloys exhibit a combination of strength \nand corrosion resistance at elevated and cryogenic temperatures, what \nmake them useful for many applications in the aerospace, automotive, \n\nmedical, chemical and petrochemical industries (JOHNSON, et al., \n2004). \n\nTheir high strength and toughness make them difficult to shape \n\nvia machining and forging. For this reason powder metallurgy \ntechniques, including powder injection molding, are alternative routes \n\nthat have been used to process these materials (JOHNSON, et al., 2004). \nAmong the superalloys that have been processed via powder \n\ninjection molding, IN718 nickel superalloy has been the most \n\nextensively studied. This alloy is usually sintered at temperatures \nbetween 1250 and 1275 \u00b0C to densities close to 100% (ASM \nInternational, 2000; JOHNSON, et al., 2004; VALENCIA, et al., 1997; \n\n\n\n51 \n\n \n\nBOSE, et al., 1997; VALENCIA, et al., 1994; HAJMRLE, et al., 1980). \n\nThe alloy IN625 is another alloy that can be processed by powder \ninjection molding; however this alloy requires higher sintering \n\ntemperatures, above 1290 \u00b0C to achieve full density (JOHNSON, et al., \n2004). \n\nThe alloy IN718 is a precipitation-hardenable nickel-chromium \n\nalloy that combines corrosion resistance and high strength. It has \nexcellent creep-rupture strength at temperatures up to 700 \u00b0C. Used in \ngas turbines, rocket motors, spacecraft, nuclear reactors, pumps, and \n\ntooling. It can form liquid phase during sintering as its melt temperature \nrange is between 1260 and 1336 \u00b0C (Special Metals Corporation, 2008). \n\nThe temperature in which sintering starts is reported to be in the range \nof ~1160 \u00b0C.

Its melting point range is 1290 \n\nto 1350 \u00b0C (Special Metals Corporation, 2008). \nThe composition of IN718 and IN625 superalloys are given on \n\nTable 4. \n\n2.1.3. Ceramic matrix composites \n\nAlthough high performance ceramics have high strength, high \n\nhardness, excellent high temperature capabilities, chemical inertness, \nhigh wear resistance and all allied to low density; these materials have \nan inherent brittleness, i.e. low fracture toughness, being prone to \n\ncatastrophic failure under mechanical or thermal stresses in the presence \nof crack-like defects (CHAWLA, 2003). Increase thermal shock \n\nresistance and toughness of these materials, making them damage \ntolerant by introducing reinforcement fibers is the main purpose of the \nproductions of CMCs (CHAWLA, 2003; CINIBULK, et al., 2004; \n\nHACKEMANN, et al., 2010). The fiber reinforced CMCs may also \nshow higher tensile strength, stiffness and creep than the monolithic \nceramics (CINIBULK, et al., 2004; HACKEMANN, et al., 2010). \n\nFor the selection of the matrix and fibers for a specific \napplication, the following properties should be considered (CHAWLA, \n\n2003): \n\ni. Melting temperature; \nii. Volatility; \n\niii. Density; \niv. Elastic modulus; \nv. Thermal expansion coefficient; \n\nvi. Creep characteristics; \nvii. Strength \n\nviii. Fracture toughness; \nix. Chemical and thermal compatibility between fiber and \n\nmatrix. \n\nSome of the items above are discussed in the following section, \njustifying the selection of the alumina-alumina CMCs used in the \npresent work. \n\n\n\n53 \n\n \n\nThe production of CMCs is driven by cost reduction in terms of \n\nfabrication and maintenance, weight reduction (mainly for aerospace \nand automotive industry), higher operation temperatures (CHAWLA, \n\n2003). Examples of applications for fiber reinforced CMCs are shown in \nTable 5. \n\nTable 5 \u2013 Potential industrial applications for fibers reinforced ceramic \n\ncomposites. \n\nProduct area Component examples \n\nAdvanced heat engines Combustors, liners, wear parts, etc. \n\nHeat recovery equipment Air preheaters, recuperators. \n\nBurners and combustors Radiant tube burners, combustors, low-\n\ntemperature radiant combustors. \n\nProcess equipment Reformers, reactors, HIP equipments. \n\nWaste incineration systems Handling equipment, internals, cleanup. \n\nSeparation/filtration Filters, substrates, centrifuges. \n\nRefractories and related Furnace linings, crucibles, flasks, etc. \n\nStructural components Beams, panels, decking, containers. \n\nAddapted from: Chawla (2003). \n\n2.1.3.1. Alumina fibers reinforced alumina matrix composites \n\nThe undesirable need for environmental barrier coatings to \nprotect SiC based composites, adds motivation to develop oxide \n\ncomposite systems that are inherently stable in oxidizing environments \n(MARSHALL, et al., 2001). \n\nAll-oxide ceramic matrix composites have currently been \n\ndeveloped for long term applications at high temperature and oxidizing \nenvironmental conditions, e.g. combustor walls of gas turbines for \npower generation or for propulsion, exhaust components, high \n\ntemperature ducts, thermal insulation, heat exchangers and hot-gas \nfilters (HACKEMANN, et al., 2010; MARSHALL, et al., 2001). \n\nDespite the problem of oxidation at high temperature applications \n\nis solved with all-oxide composites, they show lower creep resistance, \nas compared to the covalently bonded SiC, due to their predominant \n\nionic bond (HACKEMANN, et al., 2010). Nevertheless a composite \nmatching oxide fiber and oxide matrix, e.g. Al2O3-Al2O3, is an answer to \nthe problems of thermal expansion mismatch and chemical \n\n\n\n54 \n \n\ncompatibility between the elements of the composite (LEV, et al., \n\n1995). \nAlumina fiber reinforced alumina matrix composites should be \n\nsintered at temperatures below 1300 \u00b0C. Composites sintered above this \ntemperature tend to fracture in a completely brittle mode due to fiber \ndegradation. For non coated fiber, like Nextel\u2122 610, the optimum \n\nsintering temperature is 1200 \u00b0C, however pressure should be \nsimultaneously applied to achieve high densities (LEE, et al., 2003).  \n\n2.2. POROUS MATERIALS \n\n \nPorous materials are any solid material which contains cavities, \n\nchannels or interstices. Most of the materials are porous to some extend \nand it is actually difficult to find or either prepare a real non-porous \nmaterial, i.e. with null porosity. The degree of porosity influences \n\ndirectly on physical properties of the materials and its control is of great \nindustrial importance. Porosity also affects the chemical reactivity of \nsolids and the physical interaction of solids with gases and liquids \n\n(ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994). \nPores can be classified according to size, shape and availability to \n\nan external fluid. According to IUPAC, the classification of pore size is \nmade as follows (STUDART, et al., 2006; ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994): \n\ni. Microporosity \u2013 pores width smaller than 2 nm; \nii. Mesoporosity \u2013 pores width between 2 and 50 nm; \n\niii. Macroporosity \u2013 pores width larger than 50 nm. \n\nAccording to the availability to an external fluid, pores can be \n\ncategorized into two main groups: closed and open pores. Closed pores \nare totally isolated from their neighbors. This type of pores is \nrepresented by the pore (a) in Figure 6. Open pores are those which have \n\na continuous channel of communication with the external surface of the \nbody, like pores (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) in Figure 6. Yet, open pores can \n\nbe sub-classified into through pores, like (c), (d) and (e), which are \nthose open at two or more ends; or sub-classified as blind pores, like (b) \nand (f), open in only one extremity (ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994). \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nFrom the shape point of view, pores can be cylindrical, like (c) \n\nand (f); ink-bottle shaped like (b); funnel shaped like (d); or slit shaped \n(ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994). \n\nThe region marked as (g) in Figure 6 is not a pore, but roughness. \nTo distinguish pore from roughness, an adopted convention consider \nthat roughness are irregularities on the solid surface whose width is \n\nlarger than its deepness (ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994). \n\n \nFigure 6 \u2013 Schematic cross-section of a \n\nporous solid showing different types of pores. \nSource: Rouquerol, et al (1994). \n\n. \nApplications for porous materials include (ISHIZAKI, et al., \n\n1998): \n\ni. Filters; \nii. Burners; \n\niii. Catalysts; \niv. Bioreactors; \nv. Cells; \n\nvi. Grinding wheels; \nvii. Gas sensors; \n\nviii. Gas separators; \nix. Electrodes; \nx. Porous metals bearings; \n\nxi. Thermal insulators; \nxii. Capacitors; \n\nxiii. Impact energy absorbers; \n\n\n\n56 \n \n\nxiv. Heaters and heat exchangers; \nxv. Molds; \n\nxvi. Surgical implants. \n\nPorous materials can be produced by several routes, sintering \npowders compacts is one of them (ISHIZAKI, et al., 1998). Since the \n1940\u2019s, porous metallic filters have been fabricated via powder-binder \n\nmixture extrusion. Corrosion-resistant metals, such as stainless steel, \ntitanium, and nickel-based alloys, are the most suitable for filtration \n(GERMAN, 2005). In order to produce open porous materials with \n\ndesired properties it is necessary to control powder properties, green \nbody properties and sintering processes (ISHIZAKI, et al., 1998) \n\nThe main methods to characterize porous solids are \n(ROUQUEROL, et al., 1994):  \n\ni. Stereology; \nii. Radiation scattering; \n\niii. Pycnometry; \niv. Adsorption from a gas phase; \nv. Methods depending on interfacial curvature (intrusion, \n\nsuction, maximum bubble pressure); \n\nvi. Fluid flow; \nvii. Calorimetric determinations (immersion calorimetry, gas \n\nor liquid adsorption calorimetry, thermoporometry); \n\nviii. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC); \nix. Xenon NMR; \nx. Ultrasonic methods. \n\nThe replacement of solid material by voids in the component \nprovides the materials some special features, such as (STUDART, et al., \n2006): \n\ni. Low thermal mass; \nii. Low thermal conductivity; \n\niii. Controlled permeability; \niv. High surface area; \nv. Low bulk density; \n\nvi. Low dielectric constant. \n\n\n\n57 \n\n \n\nThese properties can be tailored by changing type of porosity, i.e. \n\nopen or close, pore mean size, pore size distribution, and pore \nmorphology. All this microstructural aspects are highly influenced by \n\nthe processing route used to produce a porous material (STUDART, et \nal., 2006). \n\nMacroporous materials with open porosity can be made from \n\nparticles or discontinuous fibers by partially sintering previous porous \ncompacts, or by sintering powder mixtures that undergo reactions that \nlead to pore formation (FERNANDO, et al., 2005; INNOCENTINI, et \n\nal., 2009; STUDART, et al., 2006). These macroporous materials \ngenerally have porosity between 20 and 97% with pore size ranging \n\nfrom 400 nm to 4 mm (STUDART, et al., 2006). \nApplications for macroporous ceramic materials are: hot-gas \n\nfiltration, molten metal filtration, diffusion, dispersion rolls, ink pads for \n\nfingerprinting, high temperature thermal insulators, burners and \nnumerous others (FERNANDO, et al., 2005; PRABHAKARAN, et al., \n2005; STUDART, et al., 2006). Some of these components are made of \n\nceramic materials or high temperature metal alloys (WOOD, et al., \n2008), e.g. refractory metals and superalloys. \n\n2.2.1. Hot-gas filters \n\nHot-gas filters are porous, closed-end tubes used to remove fine \nparticles in a variety of operations (CHAWLA, 2003). Advanced power \n\nsystems, such as the integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and \npressurized fluidized-bed combustion (PFBC), requiring gas turbines, \nare technologies to produce electricity and steam from coal and other \n\nhydrocarbon fuels with high efficiency and reduced emissions of sulfur \ndioxide and other pollutants. Removal of particulate and other emissions \nis required for these processes to protect the gas turbines against erosion \n\nand corrosion. To maintain a high thermal efficiency, the gas cleaning \nshould be done without a previous cooling of the gases. Filtration then \n\nshould be carried at over 350 \u00b0C for IGCC and 750 \u00b0C for PFBC. \nMoreover the filters must withstands backpressure pulses used on filter \ncleaning, i.e. removal of filter cake from the filters (DUO, et al., 1999; \n\nCHAWLA, 2003; INNOCENTINI, et al., 2009). \nOther applications for hot-gas filters are coal gasification, \n\nincineration, catalytic recovery, catalytic processing, chemical and \n\n\n\n58 \n \n\npetrochemical processing (FERNANDO, et al., 2002; CHAWLA, \n\n2003). \nAfter rapid development over the past decade, ceramic barrier \n\nfilters have emerged as the most promising choice for hot-gas cleaning \nbecause of their high corrosion resistance and their ability to withstand \nhigh temperatures up to 1000 \u00b0C (DUO, et al., 1999). \n\nMembranes with pore size ranging from 0.1 to 50 ?m and \nporosity above about 40% are adequate for use in hot-gas filtration \n(FERNANDO, et al., 2005). Other requirements for hot-gas filters are: \n\n(DUO, et al., 1999; CHAWLA, 2003; FERNANDO, et al., 2002; \nINNOCENTINI, et al., 2009) \n\ni. Long-term durability; \nii. High temperature capabilities; \n\niii. Alkali corrosion resistance; \niv. Cleanability; \nv. Thermal shock resistance; \n\nvi. Impermeability to particulates to be filtered; \nvii. Optimized permeability to the gas; \n\nviii. Lightweight; \nix. High toughness. \n\n \nFigure 7 \u2013 Scanning electron microscope image of an \n\nalumina fiber filter membrane. \n\nSource: Fernando, et al (2002) \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nHot-gas filters membranes have been made of Saffil alumina \n\nfibers (90 wt.%) and a binder (10 wt.%). The pore size of these filters \n\nranged from 1 to 23 ?m, and was considered adequate for fine particles \n\nfiltration (FERNANDO, et al., 2002). The microstructure of this type of \nmembrane is shown in Figure 7. \n\n2.2.2. Porous CMCs \n\nThere is an unconventional approach to design microstructures of \ncomposites that are damage tolerant. It relies on the weakness and low \nstiffness of a porous matrix to prevent damage from extending into the \n\nfibers (CINIBULK, et al., 2004). In this case the interface between the \nfibers and matrix might be strongly bonded (MARSHALL, et al., 2001). \n\nThe failure strain in such CMCs is greater than in monolithic ceramic. \nMatrix crack energy is dissipated through multiple microfractures in the \nporous matrix, through weak interparticle bonding. These materials can \n\nretain their mechanical properties after long-term exposure to 1100\u00b0C \nduring cyclic tension and fatigue (CINIBULK, et al., 2004). Processing \nof porous CMCs is easier because a high density is not required, thus \n\nlow sintering temperatures can be used, avoiding fiber degradation \n(CHAWLA, 2003). \n\nA process called WHIPOX\u2122 (Wound Highly Porous Oxide \n\nCMC) was developed to produce such composites. A CMC composed \nby Nextel\u2122 fibers in a porous mullite matrix was produced through this \n\nprocess. Rings and tubes of 20 and 250 mm long were sintered in air at \n1300 \u00b0C for 60 min. The fiber volume fraction varied from 25 to 50 %. \nThe porosity of the matrix was found to be over 60 vol.%. Figure 8 \n\nshows the microstructure of such composites (CHAWLA, 2003). \n\n\n\n60 \n \n\n \nFigure 8 \u2013 Microstructure of the composite obtained by \n\nWHIPOX process. \n\nSource: Chawla (2003). \n\nSome industries are interested in the performance of porous \n\nCMCs. In particular energy related components, including porous \nradiant burners and hot-gas filters, need new materials to achieve higher \noperating temperatures, higher efficiency and longer service life. \n\nRadiant burners transfer a substantial fraction of their energy input \ndirectly to the process load as infrared radiation. Increased radiant \noutput and fuel efficiency are the main benefits of using CMCs in \n\nradiant burners (CHAWLA, 2003). \nHot-gas filters are normally made of conventional monolithic \n\nceramics that fail easily during cleaning operations, which involve \n\nbackpressure pulses. The higher toughness, higher strength, higher creep \nresistance and thermal shock resistance of CMCs can be exploited in \n\nthese components. Composites consisting of Nextel\u2122 610 or Nextel\u2122 \n312 fibers in a silicon carbide or alumina matrix have been made for \nfiltering gas streams at temperatures up to 1000 \u00b0C (CHAWLA, 2003). \n\n2.3. POWDER THERMOPLASTIC EXTRUSION \n\nExtrusion is a process used to form long shapes with continuous \ncross section, such as rods, tubes, honeycombs and other infinite variety \n\n\n\n61 \n\n \n\nof profiles. In the industry, extrusion is a common process used in the \n\nfields of metallurgy, ceramics, polymers and foodstuffs \n(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\nPowder thermoplastic extrusion is the molding process of \nparticulate materials, in which a feedstock, i.e. powder-binder mixture, \nis forced through a die, where the compact extruded acquires the shape \n\nof the die channel (GERMAN, 2005). \nAfter molding a debinding step is necessary to remove the \n\nbinders and finally the component is sintered (GERMAN, 2005). \n\n2.3.1. Basics concepts on particulate materials processing \n\nThe processing of materials through powder, commonly known \n\nas particulate materials processing (PMP), is an attractive technology \ndue to its replication capabilities and the viability to tailor the product \napplication through the selective placement of phases or pores. \n\nMoreover PMP is in many cases the most competitive available \ntechnology that allows the production of materials such as composites, \nhigh-temperature ceramics, certain polymers, copper steels, refractory \n\nmetals, intermetallics and cermets (GERMAN, 2005). These materials \ncouldn\u2019t be processed in an economically viable way through \n\nconventional routes such as casting, and in many cases no other route is \navailable. \n\nThe porosity control makes PMP an useful technology to produce \n\ncomponents for filtration, lubrication and energy dissipation \n(GERMAN, 2005). \n\nParticulate material processing consist basically on conforming or \n\nmolding a chosen powder into a desired shape, and through a heat \ntreatment called sintering, bond the particles together, making the initial \nindividual particles become a solid body (GERMAN, 2005). \n\nTwo are the major routes to form a green body, compaction or \nshaping. The green body is the name given to the compact before \n\nsintering, it consist of powder and usually additives, that are added to \nimprove conformability and/or help the compact retain its shape and \nimprove mechanical strength during manufacturing steps that take place \n\nbefore sintering (GERMAN, 2005). \nCompaction is applied for granulates and powders with low \n\namount of additives, whereas shaping is applied for plastic consistence \n\n\n\n62 \n \n\nfeeds and slurries containing high amount of additives (GERMAN, \n\n2005). \nCompaction technologies can be divided into die compaction, \n\ncold isostatic compaction\n2\n, hot pressing and rolling pressing. Examples \n\nof shaping technologies are injection molding, plastic extrusion, \nthermoplastic extrusion, rolling, thermosetting and thermoplastic \n\npressing, porcelain pressing and slurry techniques\n3\n (REED, 1995; \n\nGERMAN, 2005). \n\n2.3.2. Powders \n\nPowder processing technologies deal generally with particles in \nthe range from some dozen nanometers to hundreds of microns. The \n\nmain aspects of the powders to be characterized are (GERMAN, 2005): \n\ni. Particle size and particle size distribution (PSD); \nii. Particle shape; \n\niii. Particle agglomeration; \niv. Surface area; \nv. Interparticle friction; \n\nvi. Flow and packing; \nvii. Internal structure; \n\nviii. Composition, homogeneity and contamination. \n\nThese characteristics are imposed by the material and especially \nby the powder synthesis and fabrication technique. \n\nThe shape of the particles is a very important factor on the \nprocessing and affects directly the packing, flow and compressibility \n(GERMAN, 2005). Figure 9 gives a collection of possible particles \n\nshapes. The most appropriate way to characterize the particle shape is \nthrough scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Light scattering particle \n\n                                                         \n2\n Also known as cold isostatic pressing, CIP. A variant of CIP is hot isostatic pressing, HIP, in \n\nwhich a previously sintered body is subjected to a pressurized hot-gas (REED, 1995). HIP is \n\nconsidered an enhanced sintering process rather than an compaction process. \n3\n Slurry techniques comprise: Slip casting, tape casting, pressure casting, slurry pressing, \n\nvacuum casting, centrifugal casting, gel casting, casting concrete and others. \n\n\n\n63 \n\n \n\nsize analyzers and gas adsorption (BET) are other important techniques \n\nto characterize PSD and surface area of powders (GERMAN, 2005). \n\n \nFigure 9 \u2013 Collection  of possible particle shapes. \n\nSource : German (2005) \n\n2.3.3. Additives \n\nAdditives are inorganic or organic chemicals used to tailor \npowder characteristics (GERMAN, 2005). They can be categorized as \n\nfollows: \n\ni. Solvent \u2013 used as a temporary liquid to disperse other \nadditives; \n\nii. Dispersant or deflocculant \u2013 separate particles braking \nagglomerates; \n\niii. Coagulant or flocculant- promotes particle \nagglomeration; \n\niv. Plasticizer \u2013 used to lower the viscosity of the mixture \nand modifies the viscoelastic properties of a condensed \nbinder film on the particles; \n\nv. Surfactant or wetting agent\u2013 improves binder-powder \nwetting; \n\nvi. Foaming and antifoaming agent \u2013 controls the formation \nof bubbles in the mixture; \n\nvii. Thickener \u2013 increases the apparent viscosity of the \nmixture; \n\nviii. Binder \u2013 provides green strength; \nix. Lubricant \u2013 minimizes tool wear; \n\n\n\n64 \n \n\nx. Preservative \u2013 reduces enzymatic degradation of a binder \n(GERMAN, 2005; REED, 1995). \n\n2.3.3.1. Binders \n\nBinders are polymers molecules that form a bridge between \nparticles and provide interparticle binding action (REED, 1995). The \ncombination of powder and binder is the so called feedstock \n\n(GERMAN, 2005). \nThere are several materials that can be used as binders such as \n\norganic matter of clays, natural gums, waxes, vinyl, cellulose, \n\npolyethylene glycol, resins (thermoplastics), gels, low-temperature \nreaction bonds, hydraulic cements, and so on (REED, 1995). \n\nBinder\u2019s most important function is to improve the strength of the \nas-formed product allowing it to be handled before the product is \ndensified by sintering (REED, 1995). \n\nPolymers and waxes derived from petroleum such as low density \npolyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE), \npolypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and paraffin wax are commonly \n\nused. Some natural waxes like carnauba wax (derived from the leaves of \na Brazilian palm tree), candelilla wax and beeswax are also widely used \n\n(GERMAN, 2005; REED, 1995). \nPolymers resins, e.g. PE, PP and PS, are usually added to form a \n\nbonding matrix. The strength, melting temperature and viscosity of these \n\nthermoplastics increase with the average molecular weight (REED, \n1995). \n\n2.3.3.2. Surfactants \n\nSurfactants are molecules which have a polar group in one \nextremity and have a nonpolar chain on the other side. The polar group \nattracts polar molecules and is called lyophilic group. The nonpolar \n\ngroup, usually a hydrocarbon chain, is the lyophobic group (REED, \n1995). Figure 10 shows a sketch of a surfactant and its behavior on \n\ndifferent means. \n\n\n\n65 \n\n \n\nSurfactants improve the compatibility of the solid with the liquid \n\nmedium, when adsorbed at the interface solid-liquid, reducing the \n\nsurface tension ?SL. The driving force for the adsorption of these \n\nmolecules at a surface or interface is the reduction of Gibbs free energy \n\n?G (REED, 1995). \n\n \nFigure 10 \u2013 Surfactant sketch showing its hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, \n\nand the behavior of a surfactant in different means. \nSource: Reed (1995). \n\nExamples of surfactants are: stearic acid, ethoxylated \nnonylphenol, ethoxylated tridecyl alcohol, sodium stearate, sodium \n\ndisopropylnaphtalene sulfonate, dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride \nand sodium dodecyl sulfate (REED, 1995; GERMAN, 1990). \n\n2.3.3.3. Plasticizers \n\nCeramic systems containing a binder are molded above the glass \ntransition temperature Tg of the binder. Plasticizers usually have a \n\nsmaller molecule than the binder. This molecules are distributed among \nthe chains of the binder reduces the Van der Waals forces that binds the \npolymer molecules together. This makes the binder to soften and \n\nincrease its flexibility, but also reduces its strength. Essentially the \nplasticizer reduces the Tg of the polymer (REED, 1995). In general the \nplasticizer have a low melting point (Tm). \n\nOils and waxes are used as plasticizers in the case of \nthermoplastic binders such as PE and PS. Stearic acid and oleic acid \n\nbehave as plasticizers for waxes (REED, 1995). \n\n\n\n66 \n \n\n2.3.4. Rheology \n\nRheology is the science of deformation and flow (REED, 1995). \nThe study of the rheological behavior of a fluid material is of high \n\nimportance for the design and selection of the equipments for processing \na feedstock (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nThe most important rheological property of a feedstock is the \n\nviscosity. The second important property is the elasticity. Elastic \nmaterials exhibit a shape memory effect, which implies that part of the \nsubmitted deformation is recovered after the stress is ceased. Feedstocks \n\nexhibit both viscous and elastics characteristics and are therefore termed \nviscoelastic fluids (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nOne of the effects of the viscoelasticity of polymers is the \nphenomenon known as extrudate swell\n\n4\n, in which the diameter of the \n\nextrudate out of the die is considerably higher than the diameter of the \n\ndie orifice. This occurs because the viscoelastic fluid recovers part of its \ndeformation \u2013 the elastic portion \u2013 underwent when it was forced into \nthe die (SHENOY, 1999) \n\n2.3.4.1. Shear flow \n\nThe steady simple shear flow can be described by the scheme of \n\nFigure 11. The situation describes a fluid being sheared by two plates of \narea A separated by a distance dx2. The lower plate moves with a \nvelocity v1 and the upper plate with a velocity v1+dv1. The differential \n\nvelocity dv1 is imposed by the force f. \n\nThe velocity gradient    [s\n-1\n\n] is also called shear rate and can be \n\ndefined as shows Equation 2, where the term dx1/dx2 describes the shear \n\nstrain ?. The shear stress ? [Pa], necessary to shear the fluid and \nmaintain a laminar flow, can be defined as it is shown on Equation 3. \n\nFinally Equation 4 defines the viscosity ?

Nevertheless the \nnature of the polymers and the filled polymers bring them to the \n\ncategory of non-Newtonian fluids (SHENOY, 1999). \n\n\n\n68 \n \n\n2.3.4.2. The effect of shear rate and time on non-Newtonian fluids \n\nFor non-Newtonian fluids, the viscosity can be a function of \nshear rate and time (SHENOY, 1999), and the linear relationship \n\nbetween shear rate and shear stress may not exist. \nIn general non-Newtonian fluids exhibit one of the following \n\nfeatures: \n\ni. Shear rate dependent viscosity in certain shear rate \nranges, with or without elastic behavior; \n\nii. Yield stress; \niii. Time-dependent viscosities at fixed shear rates \n\n(SHENOY, 1999). \n\nDepending on which of the previous characteristics a fluid \nexhibit, it can be classified in one of the following models (REED, \n1995; SHENOY, 1999): \n\ni. Pseudoplastic \u2013 its viscosity decreases with increasing of \nshear rate, also called shear thinning fluids,         ; \n\nii. Dilatant \u2013 its viscosity increases with increasing shear \nrate, also called shear thickening fluids,         ; \n\niii. Bingham \u2013 flows just after the shear stress exceeds a \nyield stress, then shows a linear relationship between \nshear rate and shear stress; \n\niv. Pseudoplastic with yield stress \u2013 its viscosity decreases \nwith increasing of shear rate and additionally exhibits a \nyield stress; \n\nv. Dilatants with yield stress \u2013 its viscosity increases with \nincreasing of shear rate and additionally exhibits a yield \nstress; \n\nvi. Thixotropic \u2013 exhibits a reversible decrease in shear \nstress with time at a constant temperature and shear rate; \n\nvii. Rheopectic \u2013 exhibits a reversible increase in shear stress \nwith time at a constant temperature and shear rate; \n\nviii.

Polymers \u2013 filled or not \u2013 can be \npseudoplastics with or without yield stress, thixotropics and \n\nviscoelastics (SHENOY, 1999). \n\n \nFigure 12 \u2013 Newtonian and non-Newtonian models of fluid \n\nbehavior. \n\nAdapted from: Reed (1995) \n\nFluids containing large molecules and suspensions containing \n\nnon-attracting anisometric particles, when undergo a laminar flow may \nhave the molecules or particles oriented. As orientation reduces the \nresistance to shear, the stress necessary to increase the shear rate \n\ndiminishes with increasing shear rates (REED, 1995). This gives the \npseudoplastic characteristic of the feedstocks, in which the particles \nhave a major effect on the mixture behavior (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n2.3.4.3. Effect of temperature \n\nThe viscosity of most of the fluids is temperature and pressure \ndependent. The viscosity of a fluid decreases with the increase of \n\ntemperature. And the viscosity ? varies exponentially with the absolute \ntemperature T as shown in Equation 5, where T is the temperature in \n\nKelvin, ?0 is the viscosity at a reference temperature T0, k is the \n\n\n\n70 \n \n\nBoltzmann\u2019s constant, and E is a material specific constant which \n\nrepresents the activation energy for viscous flow. High values of E \nindicate a high sensibility to temperature change (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nEquation 5          \n \n\n \n  \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\n  \n   \n\nFigure 13 illustrates the application of Equation 5 for a binder \nsystem composed by polyethylene and stearic acid, with activation \n\nenergy of 32 kJ/mol (GERMAN, 1990). The plot of the natural \nlogarithm of the viscosity, versus the inverse of the temperature is the so \ncalled Arrhenius plot. \n\n \nFigure 13 \u2013 Arrhenius plot of a natural logarithm of the \nviscosity for a polyethylene and stearic acid mixture. \n\nSource: German (1990). \n\nPolymers loaded with particles, in spite they exhibit higher \nviscosity, are more temperature sensitive than pure polymers. This \nhappens because of the difference in thermal expansion coefficients of \n\nthe polymers and the particles. The polymer expands more than the \nparticles and the solid volume fraction decreases with the increase of \ntemperature. This means that the apparent activation energy Ea is larger \n\nfor loaded systems (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n\n\n71 \n\n \n\n2.3.4.4. Effect of solid volume fraction \n\nThe viscosity of a loaded polymer increases with the addition of \npowder in the system. Furthermore, there is a limit of solids that can be \n\nadded before the viscosity becomes essentially infinite, and the mixture \ngets too stiff to be considered viscous. For monosized spheres, this limit \nis equal to the maximum random packing condition of 63,7 vol.% of \n\nsolids (GERMAN, 1990), as shown in Figure 14. \nEinstein provided an equation to predict the viscosity of \n\nsuspensions with low solid volume fraction in which the relative \n\nviscosity ?r, that is the viscosity of the loaded fluid divided by the \nviscosity of the pure fluid, has a linear relationship with the solid \n\nvolume fraction ?, as shown in Equation 6 (GERMAN, 1990), where \n       . \n\nEquation 6           \n\nEinstein\u2019s viscosity equation postulates a suspension so diluted \nthat there is no interaction between particles (MOONEY, 1951). \n\nTherefore this equation fits well just with low content of solids, i.e. less \nthan approximately 15 vol.%, and the relationship between relative \nviscosity and solid volume fraction departs from the linearity with \n\nhigher contents of solids (GERMAN, 1990), as can be seen in Figure 14. \n\n \nFigure 14 \u2013 Relative viscosity versus volume \n\nfraction of monosized glass spheres. \n\nSource: German (1990). \n\n\n\n72 \n \n\nMany other models have been proposed so far, most of them \n\nbased on Einstein\u2019s viscosity equation, to predict the change in viscosity \nwith particles loading on a powder-binder mixture. Most of the models, \n\nnevertheless, assume hard, solid and spherical particles (GERMAN, \n\n1990), and many of them express ?r as a function of the relative solids \n\nloading ?r, that is the ratio ?/?m. Moreover, the models have in common \ntwo boundary conditions that must be satisfied. \n\nFirst, the relative viscosity ?r, must be equal to unity for pure \n\nbinder, i.e. the viscosity of the mixture ? approaches the viscosity of the \n\nbinder ?b for solid contents close to zero, as represented by Equation 7. \n\nEquation 7               \n\nSecond, there is a maximum solid volume fraction ?m, and the \nviscosity approaches to infinite when the solid volume fraction \n\napproaches ?m, as it is shown on Equation 8 (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nEquation 8                \n\nThis happens because, when the solids content is too high, the \nparticles are practically in permanent contact with each other, and the \n\namount of liquid is sufficient only to fulfill the interstices between the \nparticles, as shown in Figure 15, and do not contribute to decrease the \nviscosity of the system. This liquid in the interstices is immobile and \n\ndon\u2019t participates on the basic flow process, therefore the viscosity \nincreases dramatically when the solid content reaches this condition. A \n\nlittle amount of liquid is enough to form a film between the particles and \nplay the role of a lubricant. This mobile liquid reduces the frictional \ninteraction of the particles reducing radically the system viscosity. \n\nTherefore, the suspension viscosity depends on the amount of mobile \nfluid and not on the total amount of fluid (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n\n\n73 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 15 \u2013 Sketches showing the immobile \n\nliquid when the solid volume fraction ? \n\nreaches the maximum value ?m, and the \n\nmobile liquid when ?<?m. \nSource: German (1990). \n\nAlthough viscosity data for suspensions of solid spheres are quite \nnumerous, the agreement among the various investigations has been \n\nrather poor, specially on the high concentration regime (FRANKEL, et \nal., 1967), i.e. high filling level. This makes it difficult to predict the \n\nbehavior of suspension with high contents of solids and generate a \nuniversal model. \n\nReasons pointed for the conflicting results are: wall effect in \n\ncapillary viscometers, slip at particle surfaces, insufficient dispersion, \nadsorption, turbulence, sedimentation, and others (FRANKEL, et al., \n1967). \n\nSome of the suggested models that represent the relative viscosity \nas a function of solid volume fraction are given by Equation 9 to \nFehler! Verweisquelle konnte nicht gefunden werden. that follows, \n\nwhere A, B, k and n are constants that depend on the system (GERMAN, \n1990; REED, 1995).  \n\nEquation 9 represents the model proposed by Eilers. It is an \nempirical based model in which the constant A is a factor related with \n\nthe inverse of the maximum filling level ?m, suggested to be 1.35 by \nEilers as the inverse of 0.74, that is the packing factor for monosized \nspheres on its close-packed structure. His experimental data however, \nfitted better for a factor of 1.28 and 1.30, what would lead to packing \n\nfactors of 0.78 and 0.77 respectively (EILERS, 1941; EILERS, 1949).  \n\nEquation 9       \n     \n\n    \n \n \n \n\n\n\n74 \n \n\nwhere   \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n\n    \n      \n\nMooney has also made his contribution and proposed the model \nof Equation 10. This model introduced the concept of crowding factor \n\n???, which is a function of the ratio r1/r2 of the particle radius in a \nbimodal particle size distribution. Mooney calls the crowding effect the \noccupancy of the remaining free volume, between particles of size r1, by \n\nthe particles of size r2. The constant k is a particular value of ??? called \nthe self-crowding factor, which by a purely geometric argument must be \nhigher than 1.35 and smaller than 1.91 (MOONEY, 1951). \n\nEquation 10        \n    \n\n    \n  \n\nwhere             \n\nThe model of Krieger and Dougherty, Equation 11, takes into \nconsideration the non-Newtonian behavior, attributed to ability of the \nshear stress, transmitted through a continuous medium, to orient or \n\ndistort the suspended particles in opposition to the randomizing effects \nof Brownian motion. The variation of viscosity with shear rate is the \nresult of the decrease of resistance to flow offered by the oriented or \n\ndistorted arrangement. The appearance of this non-Newtonian behavior \nis related with crowding. Such affirmation derives from the fact that \nthese systems show Newtonian behavior up to relatively high \n\nconcentrations, 20 vol.% (KRIEGER, et al., 1959). \n\nEquation 11       \n \n\n  \n \n      \n\n \n\nKrieger and Dougherty\u2019s model derived from a modification of \n\nMooney\u2019s functional analysis, where the constant [?] is the \u201cintrinsic \nviscosity\u201d and should be close to 5/2 (KRIEGER, et al., 1959). \n\nFrankel and Acrivos achieved one purely theoretical model, with \nno empirical constants. Their model, shown on Equation 12, is valid for \n\nhigh concentrations and can be applied for suspensions where ?r \n\n\n\n75 \n\n \n\napproaches to unity, in other words, when ? tends to ?m (FRANKEL, et \nal., 1967). \n\nEquation 12      \n      \n\n \n  \n\n        \n \n\n  \n  \n\nOn Equation 12 the constant A is related with the region of \n\ninfluence of the particle. The region of influence, called cell by the \nauthors, can be of different geometries. Therefore, the constant A can \nrepresent different numerical values, being fairly sensitive to the \n\nassumed geometry of the cell. For instance, a spherical cell results in a \n\nvalue of 9/8 and a cubic cell results in a value of 3?/16 (FRANKEL, et \nal., 1967). \n\nChong and co-workers have also achieved an empirical model, \nEquation 13, of the same type of Eilers\u2019, however with a different \nconstant (CHONG, et al., 1971). \n\nEquation 13            \n    \n\n      \n  \n\n \n \n\nQuemada proposed also an equation including the \n\npseudoplasticity in his model, like Krieger and Dougherty did, but \nfurthermore considered the diffusion coefficient D of particles in the \nmedium. So his general formulation considered that viscosity and \n\ndiffusion are both functions of the solid volume fraction ? and shear rate \n  , in mathematical notation         and         (QUEMADA, 1977). \n\nThe model of Quemada assumed a rectangular concentration \nprofile with no effective diffusion (QUEMADA, 1977), and a \nrectangular velocity profile. This assumptions were based on a two-\n\nphase flow with a concentrated axial core and a marginal layer, close to \n\nthe wall, with null concentration, ? = 0. Another bound condition was \nthat when     , not only    , but also         \n(QUEMADA, 1977). Quemada\u2019s approach leads to a very simple \nmodel, represented by Equation 14. \n\nEquation 14       \n \n\n  \n \n  \n\n \n\n\n\n76 \n \n\nThe models discussed above can be used to predict the relative \n\nviscosity for a certain solid loading, but there is a range of solid loading \nconsidered the optimal loading for processing. In practice, this optimal \n\nloading contains less powder than the maximum filling level \n(GERMAN, 1990).  \n\nOne of the reasons is the extremely high viscosity close to the \n\nmaximum filling level. Another reason is that the difference between \ndensities of powder and binder implies in a large sensitivity to the \ninherent fluctuations that occurs in compounding a mixture, which is \n\nmade in a weight basis (GERMAN, 1990). That means that a small error \non weighting of powder and binder during compounding, represent a \n\nconsiderable change in volume fraction when working near the \nmaximum filling level, as shown in Figure 16. \n\n \nFigure 16 \u2013 Powder volume fraction versus powder weight \n\nfraction. A small error in the weight is amplified in the \n\nvolume loading near the maximum loading. \nSource: German (1990). \n\nSince the viscosity of the mixture changes very rapidly with the \nsolid volume content in the region close to the maximum filling level, \n\nsmall differences of solid volume fraction can be amplified into large \nviscosity shifts as shown in Figure 17 (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n\n\n77 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 17 \u2013 Relative viscosity versus powder volume \nloading. Small error in volume loading represents large \n\nchanges in viscosity near maximum loading. Relative \nviscosity can become infinite for errors that achieves \n\nhigher loading than the maximum. \n\nSource: German (1990). \n\n2.3.4.5. Effect of particle characteristics \n\nThe size of the particles influences the viscosity of the mixture. \nThe smaller the particle size, the higher is the surface area and higher is \nthe interaction between particles, increasing the interparticle friction. \n\nFor this reason the viscosity of feedstocks is inversely proportional with \nthe particle size. This, though, has just a considerable effect for \n\nsubmicrometer particle size (GERMAN, 1990). \nMore relevant than the particle size is the particle size \n\ndistribution. PSD influences considerably the viscosity of the system. \n\nMixing powder with different sizes improve the packing density and \nthereby decrease the viscosity at any given solid volume fraction \n(GERMAN, 1990). This is because the small particles can occupy the \n\ninterstices of the larger ones, once occupied by immobile fluid. The \nexcess of fluid becomes mobile fluid and is available to contribute with \nthe flow process. Moreover smaller particles can be interposed between \n\n\n\n78 \n \n\nlarger particles and act as a lubricant facilitating the rotation of larger \n\nparticles (SHENOY, 1999). \nThe greater the packing density, the lower the relative viscosity \n\nfor the same solid volume fraction. Therefore a wide PSD will give a \nlower viscosity than a narrower one, allowing a higher solid loading \n(GERMAN, 1990). Figure 18 shows the effect of the percentage of \n\nsmall particles mixed with larger particles on the viscosity, with a size \nratio of 21 and solid content of 55 vol.%. \n\n \nFigure 18 \u2013 Effect of the percentage of small particles on \n\nrelative viscosity for a bimodal mixture of spheres at a \n\nsolid content of 55 vol.% and a size ratio of 21. \nSource: German (1990). \n\nThe shape of the particles is also crucial and non-spherical \nparticles increase the viscosity of the systems due to the lower inherent \n\npacking density and higher interparticle friction. Irregular particle shape \nand agglomerated particles decreases the maximum packing density, \nincreasing therefore the relative viscosity (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nThe presence of fibers in the feedstocks will increase the \nviscosity, increase the shear thinning effect, due to alignment, and \nincrease the strength of the green body after solidification (GERMAN, \n\n1990). \nAs more the ratio lengh-diameter L/D departs from the unit, \n\nlower is the maximum loading and higher is the relative viscosity for a \nsame solid content (GERMAN, 1990), as can be seen on Figure 19. \n\n \n\n\n\n79 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 19 \u2013 The effect of particle shape on the relative \n\nviscosity for a suspension of glass particles in water.

Rheometry \n\nRheometry is the measurement arm of rheology and is used to \n\nquantify the rheological parameters of practical importance. A \nrheometer can measure the force generated to an applied deformation \n\nmode, or measure the deformation caused by an applied force mode \n(SHENOY, 1999). \n\nRheometers can be divided into rotational and capillary types. \n\nThe most common tests applied to polymer-powder mixtures are \n(GERMAN, 1990; SHENOY, 1999): \n\ni. Capillary plunger extrusion; \nii. Capillary screw extrusion; \n\niii. Rotating coaxial cylinders; \niv. Rotating parallel plates; \nv. Torque measurements in mixing rheometers \u2013 torque \n\nrheometer; \n\nvi. Rotating cone-on-plate tests. \n\n\n\n80 \n \n\nA capillary rheometer measures the pressure drop and the flow \n\nrate associated with the forced flow through a small capillary cylinder \n(GERMAN, 1990). Figure 20 shows the main features of a constant \n\nplunger speed with circular orifice capillary rheometer. \n\n \nFigure 20 \u2013 Schematic diagram of a \n\nconstant plunger speed with circular orifice \ncapillary rheometer.  \n\nAdapted from: Shenoy (1999). \n\nThe torque rheometer is also an instrument that allows \n\nrheological studies in the basis of torque measurements as a function of \ntemperature, time and rotation speeds. It consists in melting the mixture \n\ninside a chamber and, with two rollers rotating in opposite directions, \nmix the melt measuring the torque necessary for the mixing. Different \ntypes of rollers, that impose different shear stresses to the mixtures, can \n\nbe also selected. The problem of the torque rheometer is that its \ngeometry and the three-dimensional nature of the flow field in the \nchamber make it difficult to evaluate rheological properties of melts \n\n(CHENG, et al., 2001), in a way that torque and rotation speed data \ncannot be easily converted into shear stress and shear rate, respectively. \n\nAnother issue is that, differently from other rheometers, the mixer \n\nchamber of the torque rheometer is usually only partially filled \u2013 \n65~90% of the chamber volume, while 70% is a standard value \n\n\n\n81 \n\n \n\n(CHENG, et al., 2001). The cavities present in the partial filled chamber \n\ninfluence the measurement. Figure 21 shows a schematic diagram of a \ntorque rheometer chamber. \n\n \nFigure 21 \u2013 Schematic diagram of the chamber of a torque rheometer. \nAdapted from: Maity, et al. (1999) \n\n2.3.5. Mixing \n\nMixing is the first step in the preparation of the feedstock for \n\nmolding. Uniform quantities of particles and binder are needed in all \nportions of the mixture, and intensive mixing is needed to ensure that \neach interstice between the particles contains a representative \n\ncombination of the binder components. For particulate materials \nprocessing it is desired that every portion of the mixture contains an \nequal concentration of powder and the same particle size distribution \n\n(GERMAN, 1990). \nThe inhomogeneities can occur in two forms, separation of binder \n\nfrom powder, and segregation according to particle size, shape or \ndensity within the binder. The segregation leads to uneven densities and \ndistortion of the final product. Size segregation is more problematic for \n\nhigh particle size ratios or wide particle size distributions, and in \npractice, segregation can be minimized by maintaining a high binder \nviscosity (GERMAN, 1990).  \n\nMany indexes for mixture homogeneity have been proposed, \nincluding measurements of the torque and energy during mixing, shear \n\nmodulus, viscosity, density, concentration and particle size in the \nmixture. From a rheological point of view, pseudoplastic behavior is \nassociated with a well mixed system, while instability with shear rates \n\nrelates to poorly mixed systems (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n\n\n82 \n \n\n2.3.5.1. Mixing kinetics and practice \n\nThe initial action of mixing is to break clusters by shear. With \ncontinued mixing, cluster size decreases and binder becomes dispersed \n\nbetween the particles (GERMAN, 1990).  \nThe mixing torque can be used to determine the homogeneity of \n\nthe mixture as shown in Figure 22. Initial low torque corresponds to the \n\nplain binder. When the powder is added the torque increases to a high \nlevel. As the agglomerates break apart and the immobilized liquid is \nreleased the torque decreases. As more liquid is released the torque \n\ndecreases, initially in an exponential manner. At the steady-state, i.e. no \nchange in torque with time, the rate of mixing equals to the rate of \n\ndemixing. After achieving the steady-state, any change in the mixer \nspeed or temperature will cause a torque shift (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n \nFigure 22 \u2013 Mixing  torque as a function of \n\nmixing time. Steady-state torque is associated \nwith mixture homogeneity. \n\nSource: German (1990) \n\nTo attain homogeneity, several details must be considered in \n\npractice. First the temperature must be enough to both lower the \nviscosity and to reduce the yield point of the mixture. Cavitation defects \nmay occur if the temperature is too low and the effects of the yield \n\nstrength are still present. A too high temperature can degrade the binders \nor cause separation of powder from the binder (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nThe practice of mixing should occur as follows (GERMAN, \n1990): \n\n\n\n83 \n\n \n\ni. The binder of highest melting point is added to the \npreheated chamber; \n\nii. Selectively lower temperature binders are added with \nappropriate temperature reductions when necessary, to \navoid evaporation or degradation; \n\niii. As the chamber becomes fuller, mechanical work \nincreases and considerable heating may occur. \nTemperature control is important in this case; \n\niv. The powder is then added. \nv. At this point the temperature may reduce drastically if \n\nthe powder has a high heat capacity (metallic powders \n\nmainly); \nvi. The mixing torque, after the powder has been added, \n\nbecomes relatively higher, because of inhomogeneities, \n\ninterparticle friction, and decrease in temperature; \nvii. As temperature and homogeneity increases, the torque \n\nreduces fast; \n\nviii. Finally, when temperature is stable and a good level of \nhomogeneity is achieved, the torque reaches a steady-\n\nstate value; \n\n2.3.6. Extrusion molding \n\nThe extrusion process consists basically in pushing or forcing a \n\nmaterial through an opening. Extruder die refers to the part of the \nmachine containing the opening through which the material is forced. \nAs the material is squeezed through the die, it acquired the shape of the \n\ndie opening. The extruded product is referred to as the extrudate \n(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\nExtruders are the most important piece of machinery in the \n\npolymer processing industry, but also many different materials can be \nformed through extrusion process, e.g. metals, clays, ceramics, \n\nfoodstuffs, etc. Materials can be extruded in the molten or in the solid \nstate. Polymers are generally extruded in the molten state; nevertheless, \nthe solid state extrusion can be used for some specific applications \n\n(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\n\n\n84 \n \n\n2.3.6.1. Plunger extruders \n\nPlunger or ram extruders are simple in design, rugged and can \nonly operate in a discontinuous fashion. Figure 23 shows schematically \n\na plunger extruder used in powder thermoplastic extrusion. Plunger \nextruders are able to generate very high pressures (RAUWENDAAL, \n1986). \n\n \nFigure 23 \u2013 Sketch of a plunger extruder used in \n\nthermoplastic powder extrusion. \nSource: German (1990). \n\nThis type of extruder is being used for small shot size molding \nmachines and other applications that take advantage of its outstanding \n\npressure generation, e.g. extrusion of ultrahigh molecular weight \npolyethylene (UHMWPE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) that \nrequires pressures in the order of 300 MPa (RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\nAnother well known application of plunger extrusion is the solid \nstate extrusion. This technique was borrowed from the metal industry, \n\nwhere solid state extrusion has been used for decades. Solid state \nextrusion consists in force the polymer through a die in a temperature \nbelow its melting point. This causes a drastic deformation in the \n\nmaterial, which leads to an accentuated chain orientation, more effective \nthan that which occurs in conventional melt extrusion. Thus \nextraordinary mechanical properties can be attained (RAUWENDAAL, \n\n1986). \nApart from the extraordinarily high mechanical properties, solid \n\nstate extrusion provides some other benefits such as (RAUWENDAAL, \n1986): \n\n\n\n85 \n\n \n\ni. Virtually no extrudate swell occurs; \nii. Higher surface quality and low surface friction \n\ncoefficient can be obtained; \n\niii. Polymers maintain the high tensile strength at higher \ntemperatures; \n\niv. Melting point of the polymer is increased with the high \nmolecular orientation. \n\n2.3.6.2. Extrusion pressure \n\nDie forming is a pressure consuming, in other words, it requires \n\npressure to occur. The pressure necessary for the extrusion process to \noccur depends on (RAUWENDAAL, 1986): \n\ni. Geometry of the flow channel; \nii. Flow properties of the material to be extruded; \n\niii. Temperature distribution in the material to be extruded; \niv. Flow rate throw the die. \n\n2.3.6.3. Extrudate swell \n\nIt is a typical phenomenon on the polymer melt extrusion process \n\nwhich consists in the swelling of the extrudate as it leaves the die, as can \nbe seen in Figure 24. The responsible for this phenomenon is the \n\nviscoelasticity of the polymer, more precisely the elastic recover of the \ndeformation through which the polymer was submitted in the die \n(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\nThe amount of swelling that the extrudate undergoes depends on \n(RAUWENDAAL, 1986; CHEREMISINOFF, 1987; DEALY, et al., \n2000): \n\ni. Shear rate; \nii. Polymer molecular weight. \n\niii. Time during which the extrudate is held under \ndeformation; \n\n\n\n86 \n \n\niv. Temperature; \n\nExtrudate swell is intimately related with the polymer chains \norientation. When the extrudate undergoes higher shear rates, the \n\npolymer chains orient more and consequently more elastic recover can \noccur. Moreover, if a polymer has longer chains, i.e. higher molecular \nweight, elastic recover is even higher due to rearrangement of oriented \n\nchains, consequently, the extrudate swell is also higher \n(CHEREMISINOFF, 1987). \n\nThe elastic recover is time-dependent, which means that it only \n\noccurs after a limited time subsequent to the undergone deformation. In \nother words, the deformation can be recovered to a large extent shortly \n\nafter the occurrence of the deformation. However, after longer times the \nrecoverable deformation reduces. That is the reason why short length \ndies create larger swelling than long length dies. In longer dies, a certain \n\namount of relaxation occurs in the polymer structure before it leaves the \ndie (RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\n \nFigure 24 \u2013 Sketch of an extrudate suffering \nswelling in the die exit region. Note that the \n\nvelocity profile changes from parabolic to \n\nstraight. \nSource: Rauwendaal (1986). \n\n2.3.6.4. Die flow instabilities \n\nThe two most common flow instabilities that affect extrudate \n\nproducts are shark skin and melt fracture. \n\n\n\n87 \n\n \n\nShark skin is the occurrence of a mat surface. It is generally \n\nformed in the channel or in the die exit. The cause of the occurrence of \nthis problem is related with the change in velocity profile, also shown on \n\nFigure 24. The main parameters that influence on the appearance of this \ndefect are the temperature and the extrusion speed. Decreasing the \nextrusion speed and increasing the temperature can reduce the problem. \n\nVery low temperature may also reduce shark skin defects \n(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\nMelt fracture is a more severe distortion of the extrudate and can \n\nappear in many different forms such as the examples shown in Figure \n25. Melt fracture are not surface defect, like shark skin, but are \n\nassociated with the whole body of the extrudate. The causes of melt \nfracture are not in agreement in the literature. But it was found to be \nreduced by controlling the temperature, extrusion speed or changing the \n\ndie geometry (RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\n \nFigure 25 \u2013 Various forms of melt fracture: (a) regular \n\nripple, (b) bamboo, (c) spiral and (d) random fracture. \nSource Rauwendaal (1986). \n\n2.3.7. Debinding \n\nDebinding is the removal of the binder. The binder should be \n\nextracted from the compact as a fluid \u2013 in the liquid or gas state \u2013 \nwithout distorting or contaminating the compact. This can be attained by \n\nsix main different techniques that are divided into thermal debinding \nand solvent debinding (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n\n\n88 \n \n\nThermal debinding techniques are diffusion, permeation and \n\nwicking. Diffusion and permeating consist in heat the compact to a \ntemperature high enough to cause the evaporation or degradation of the \n\nbinder. Degradation can occur as decomposition, chain scission or \ndepolymerization. If the compact has low porosity, diffusion is \nfavorable, otherwise permeation occurs. Wicking is a technique in \n\nwhich the molten binder is extracted from the compact to the pores of a \nwicking substrate via capillary forces. In the wicking process the \ntemperature should be enough to decrease sufficiently the viscosity of \n\nthe binder (GERMAN, 1990). \nSolvent debinding techniques are divided into extraction, high \n\npressure and thermally assisted. These techniques consist in immersing \nthe compact in a fluid that is able to dissolve some of the binders. The \nsolvent induce binder flow out of the compact based on the chemical \n\nconcentration gradient. The role of the solvent debinding is to create a \npore structure, promoting channels through which vapor of the \nremaining binder can flow in the subsequent debinding by evaporation. \n\nExtraction is the simple immersion in a solvent. The high pressure \ntechnique utilizes a supercritical in which vapor and liquid are \n\nindistinguishable. The thermally assisted solvent debinding uses heat to \nincrease the kinetics of the process, the solvent in this case may be in the \nvapor state. Solvents commonly used include ethanol, ethylene chloride, \n\ntrichloroethylene, pentane, methylene chloride, Freon, acetone, hexane \nand heptane (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nIn practice two or more techniques mentioned above are \n\ncombined to accelerate the debinding cycle. One key factor on \ndebinding is to use multiple component binder system, allowing \ndebinding to occur progressively in more than one step, so that after the \n\nremoval of the first binder, another is still in a sufficient amount to hold \nthe particles cohesively. Reactive atmospheres can reduce the binder \n\nremoval time, but may also alter the particles composition (GERMAN, \n1990). \n\nAnother relevant aspect is, when the binder is removed from the \n\ninterstices of the particles, the compact becomes very fragile until it is \nsintered, though it must have sufficient strength to retain its shape \n(GERMAN, 1990). The compact after binder removal is often called \n\nbrown part, in allusion with the green part after molding. \nUsually wax and oils are removed by solvent debinding. On the \n\nother hand, the polymers with higher molecular weights are usually \nthermally removed. Oils and waxes should be over 30 vol.% of the \nbinder, to form a sufficient interconnectivity to the surface and, later, to \n\n\n\n89 \n\n \n\nprovide an interconnected porous network that allows the polymers to \n\nevaporate in a subsequent thermal debinding step (GERMAN, 1990). \nThe last polymers to be removed form the so called backbone, and are \n\nthe binder components that will retain the shape of the compact until the \nearlier steps of sintering. \n\nThe debinding process is highly influenced by the permeability of \n\nthe particles in the compact. The permeability in its turn is dependent on \nthe packing density of the powder. Large particle size distributions lead \nto higher densities and decrease the permeability of the compact \n\n(GERMAN, 1990).  The low permeability caused by dense packing \npowders difficult the debinding process. \n\nDuring debinding, capillary forces act pulling particles together. \nIf the compact is less dense than the critical loading, the liquid \u2013 molten \nbinder or solvent \u2013 lubricates the surface of the particles that will \n\nrearrange migrating and sometimes agglomerating. As the binder is \nremoved, the particles approach each other until contact each other, this, \nsummed with possible residual binder, gives the compact strength. The \n\nremoval of the residual binder can only occur by evaporation, i.e. \nthermal debinding, and must occur at the onset of sintering, since the \n\ncompact cannot be handled once the binder is totally removed \n(GERMAN, 1990). \n\nHigh debinding rates can be achieved with thin compact sections, \n\nlarge particles, high porosity, large pressure gradients and high \ntemperatures (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n2.3.7.1. Debinding rate and atmosphere \n\nHigh solid contents make debinding process slower due to \nreduced permeability of the binder through the denser particles packing. \nIt is proved that shorter debinding times as well as better dimensional \n\ncontrol is achieved using a solvent debinding step. Nevertheless all \ndebinding routes end up with thermal evaporation step prior to sintering \n\n(GERMAN, 1990). \nBasically thermal evaporating rates depend on three factors: \n\nbinder molecular weight, atmosphere, and temperature. Evaporating \n\nrates decreases with increasing molecular weight of the binder. \nAtmosphere is also a very important factor that influences debinding \nrates and the selection between oxidizing, inert or reducing atmosphere \n\n\n\n90 \n \n\nmust be carefully made. Temperature obviously affects directly the \n\nbinder removal, and the rate increases with increasing temperatures \n(GERMAN, 1990). \n\nOxidizing atmosphere makes debinding faster by oxidative \ndegradation of the binder. The oxygen breaks the binder molecules apart \nincreasing the evaporation rate. For most of metallic powders carry must \n\nbe taken not to expose the material to oxygen at high temperatures, \nwhich would alter the surface chemistry of the particles, making \nsintering difficult (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nInert or reducing atmosphere retards the evaporation of the binder \nas can be seen in Figure 26. The plain binder and a binder mixed with \n\npowder shows a different evaporating kinetics as can also be seen in \nFigure 26. \n\n \nFigure 26 \u2013 Cumulative binder weight loss versus \n\ntemperature for plain polyethylene in Air and N2 \n\natmosphere; and polyethylene mixed with iron \npowder in N2 atmosphere. \n\nSource: German (1990). \n\nCommonly used atmospheres for thermal debinding are air, \n\nhydrogen, nitrogen, argon, methane and mixtures such as nitrogen-\nhydrogen, hydrogen-argon, and nitrogen-hydrogen-water. Vacuum is \nalso used, but is best performed in the presence of a partial pressure \n\natmosphere (GERMAN, 1990). \nA problem closely related with atmosphere is residual carbon in \n\nthe compact. The control of residual carbon is attained through selection \nof the debinding atmosphere, atmosphere flow rate. Heating rate has \n\n\n\n91 \n\n \n\nalso influence on the formation of residual carbon, however its role is \n\nnot so clear and residual carbon can form either at low or high heating \nrates. There are evidences that show that, if the binder is not fully \n\nremoved until debinding temperature reaches 450 \u00b0C, residual carbon \nmay occur. As carbon control is not so simple, usually residual carbon is \nremoved on the sintering step at higher temperatures (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n2.3.7.2. Debinding defects \n\nThe most common defect is the compact deformation by viscous \nflow, caused by gravity and compact weight. Powder can flow under \n\nrelative low stresses, leading to distortion during debinding as the \nbinder, which previously retained the compact shape by bonding \nbetween the particles, is removed from the compact. Deformation is \n\nmore likely to happen for larger particle sizes, low solid contents, and \nhigher particle sphericity (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nBlisters, craters and vapor blowholes are other common \n\nproblems. Vapor bubbles can nucleate during thermal debinding, if \npermeation or diffusion of vapor from the bubble to the surface does not \n\noccur, the pressure increases and displacement of particles may happen, \nleading to formation of such defects. Vapor diffusivity can decrease for \nhigher packing density, which is influenced by particle size distribution, \n\nthicker sections, and larger particles. Blister, craters and blowholes are \nalso particularly common when binder constituents are too volatile or if \nthe heating rate is too fast. Entrapped air can also be a cause \n\n(GERMAN, 1990).  \nSingle component binder systems offer higher probability for the \n\nappearance of debinding defects, due to difficult extraction (GERMAN, \n\n1990). \n\n2.3.8. Sintering \n\nSintering is a heating process that causes particles to bond \ntogether and develops the desired microstructure and properties \n(GERMAN, 2005; GERMAN, 1990; REED, 1995). The term sintering \n\nis often erroneously associated with shrinkage and densification. \n\n\n\n92 \n \n\nAlthough this happens in most of the cases, for some materials and \n\ncertain applications, e.g. porous materials, the products may actually be \nless dense after sintering and experience swelling instead of shrinkage \n\n(REED, 1995). \nSintering triggers at one-half to two-thirds of the absolute melting \n\ntemperature of the material. This temperature is sufficient to cause \n\natomic diffusion for solid-state sintering (REED, 1995; GERMAN, \n2005). \n\nMicroscopically, the first effects of sintering start to become \n\nevident in the formation of necks on the contact points between adjacent \nparticles (GERMAN, 2005; GERMAN, 1990).  Figure 27 show the \n\nnecks grown in the contact of nickel particles sintered at 1200 \u00b0C for one \nhour. \n\n \nFigure 27 \u2013 Scanning electron image of neck formed \n\non nickel particles sintered at 1200 \u00b0C for 60 min in \nvacuum. \n\nSource: Plastics Today (2010). \n\nSintering is a temperature-dependent mechanism, whose driving \n\nforce is the reduction of the total Gibb\u2019s free energy ?GT, which is the \n\nsum of change in the free energy associated with volume ?GV, \n\nboundaries ?GB, and surface area ?GS of grains, according to Equation \n15 (REED, 1995). \n\nEquation 15                 \n\n\n\n93 \n\n \n\nThe major driving force component in sintering is associated with \n\nthe free surface energy, which depends directly with surface area ?AS, \naccording to Equation 16 (REED, 1995). \n\nEquation 16           \n\nThe reduction in free surface energy is only possible with atomic \nmobility. For atoms to move, they need to break the bond with neighbor \n\natoms, and for that a minimum energy should be reached. The amount \nof atoms that have sufficient energy to move increases with temperature \n\nexponentially, thus sintering is faster for higher temperatures \n(GERMAN, 2005). \n\nSintering is also faster for smaller particles, because of their \n\nhigher surface area. (GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005). \n\n2.3.8.1. Solid-state sintering stages \n\nSintering evolves through three mains stages named initial, \n\nintermediate and final. Figure 28 shows schematically the evolution of \nloose spherical powder during sintering through the three stages. \n\nThe initial stage of sintering is characterized by the formation and \ngrowth of several necks. In this stage pores are irregular and angular in \nshape. This process results on compact shrinkage that is about 3% on the \n\ninitial stage (GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005). \nMost of the shrinkage and densification occur during the \n\nintermediate stage and density reaches 92% of the theoretical value. It is \n\nduring the intermediate stage that most of the properties development \nrelated with the sintering process occur. Pores develop a smoother and \n\nrounder or cylindrical shape and their sizes reduce gradually, but an \ninterconnected pore network is present until the end of this stage \n(GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005). \n\n\n\n94 \n \n\n \nFigure 28 \u2013 Conceptual evolution of spherical \nparticles through the three stages of sintering. \n\nSource: German (2005). \n\nThe final stage is denoted by closed pores with spherical or lens \n\nshape and an extensive grain growth occurs. The original particles have \nlost their individuality and are no longer distinguishable. It is \n\ncharacterized by a slow kinetics, since most of the available energy from \nthe excess surface free energy has been consumed during the previous \nstages. The porous are located on the grain boundaries intersections or \n\ninside the grain, isolated from each other (GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, \n2005). \n\n2.3.8.2. Sintering parameters \n\nSintering is a process inherently dependent on (GERMAN, \n1990): \n\ni. Particle size; \nii. Initial powder packing uniformity and density; \n\niii. Temperature; \niv. Time; \n\n\n\n95 \n\n \n\nv. Heating rate; \nvi. Atmosphere. \n\nThe two first parameters are related with the material and \n\nprevious process steps, while the other four are the parameters related \nwith the sintering process itself. As mentioned in the previous section, \nsintering is faster for small particle sizes, as the reduction of the surface \n\nfree energy is the driving force of the process (GERMAN, 1990). \nPowder packing uniformity and a high green density can improve \n\nsintering, because of the higher particle contact coordination and lower \n\ninitial porosity. This leads to a faster sintering and lower shrinkage \n(GERMAN, 1990). \n\nHigh heating rates may cause distortion or cracks due to \nallotropic transformations or non-uniform heating in the case of thick \nsections. A fast heating may also cause retention of residual carbon \n\n(GERMAN, 2005). On the other hand, a too slow heating rate may \ncause grain growth due to long exposures time at high temperatures \n(COOVATTANACHAI, et al., 2010). \n\nIncreased sintering time results in higher densities but bigger \ngrain sizes (GERMAN, 1990), whereas high temperatures results in \n\ngreater shrinkage and higher density, but also grain growth and pore \ncoarsening (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nAtmosphere plays an important role during sintering. Common \n\nsintering atmospheres are: hydrogen, dissociated ammonia, water vapor, \nargon, helium, nitrogen, methane, propane, and mixtures of these gases. \nVacuum is also often used, with or without partial pressure control. \n\nThere are three mains aspects to be concerned with the atmosphere \nduring sintering (REED, 1995; GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005): \n\ni. Non-soluble gas proceeding from the atmosphere can be \ntrapped into closed pores refraining pore shrinkage and \ndensity improvement; \n\nii. The partial pressure of the gases contained in the \natmosphere may control the vaporization of elements or \nthe stoichiometry of compounds in the particles; \n\niii. Reactive gases from the atmosphere may reduce or \noxidize the particles elements or compounds; \n\n\n\n96 \n \n\nAccording to the reactivity of the atmosphere, they can be \n\nclassified as (GERMAN, 2005): \n\ni. Oxidizing \u2013 carbon dioxide, water or oxygen; \nii. Neutral \u2013 argon, helium or vacuum; \n\niii. Reducing \u2013 hydrogen or carbon monoxide; \niv. Hydriding \u2013 hydrogen, ammonia; \nv. Dehydriding \u2013 vacuum or argon; \nvi. Nitriding \u2013 nitrogen or ammonia; \n\nvii. Carburizing \u2013 methane or propane; \nviii. Decarburizing \u2013 carbon dioxide, or oxygen. \n\nOxide ceramics are usually sintered in air, but most of the high-\n\nperformance materials require protective atmospheres, including even \noxides. Metallic powders usually require a protective atmosphere \u2013 inert \nor reducing \u2013 to avoid oxidation (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n  \n\n\n\n97 \n\n \n\n3. EXPERIMENTAL \n\nThis chapter describes the experimental methods used in this \nwork and was divided in three sections. The first one shows all the \n\nmaterials utilized in the work.

METHODS \n\n3.2.1. Feedstock development \n\nBefore the extrusion of the tubes, attention was given to the \nfeedstock behavior during mixing, shaping and, especially, debinding. \n\nTo develop the feedstock, no fibers were added in the mixture, so that \n\n\n\n100 \n \n\nonly the powders, binders and additives would influence the rheological \n\nbehavior and debinding kinetics. \nTwo main parameters of the feedstock were investigated and \n\ndefined. The first was the filling level, i.e. solid volume content. The \nsecond parameter was the binder system, i.e. the types and proportions \nof binders and additives. Hereafter binder system must be considered a \n\nmixture of all binders and additives, regardless if a component of the \nmixture has the binder function or not. The idea was to develop a \nfeedstock that could be used for both alumina and IN718 powders. As a \n\nstarting point, preliminary tests were performed performed with a \nfeedstock composed of LDPE70 and 54 vol.% of solids. \n\nMixing was always carried out in the kneader adding first the \nbinder with highest melting point and subsequently the binders with \nlower melting point. After all the binders were molten, the powder was \n\nadded. The chamber effective volume was 69 cm\n3\n, however only 70 % \n\nof the volume was used, i.e. 48.3 cm\n3\n. The procedure was in agreement \n\nwith the literature (GERMAN, 1990; CHENG, et al., 2001). Mixing \n\noccurred in 2 steps. First, a pre-mixing at 180 \u00b0C for 30 minutes, then a \nfinal mixing at 152 \u00b0C for 40 minutes. The rotation speed was 10 RPM \n\nin both steps. The first step was responsible for mixing the binder \ncomponents and adsorbing binder to powder and breakage of fibers. The \nsecond step, at lower temperature and consequently higher shear stress, \n\nwas responsible for breakage of agglomerates and fibers. \nThe prepared feedstock was then granulated in a capillary \n\nrheometer at 140 \u00b0C through a cylindrical die with diameter of 1.0 mm \n\nand length of 28 mm. Granulation was performed at three different \npiston speeds, with the corresponding shear rate and granulation speed \nshown in Table 9. Granulation speed means the velocity at which the \n\nextrudate comes out o the die\n5\n. During granulation, cylinder pressure \n\nand piston force were measured. \n\nTable 9 \u2013 Granulation parameters. \n\nPiston speed (mm/min) Granulation speed (mm/min) Shear rate (s\n-1\n\n) \n\n1.04 600 80 \n1.30 750 100 \n\n1.56 900 120 \n\n \n\n                                                         \n5\n Granulation speed was calculated with a simple geometric relation between the area of the \n\ncylinder and the area of the die channel cross sections. By knowing the speed of the piston \n\ninside the cylinder was possible to calculate the speed of the extrudate on the die channel. \n\n\n\n101 \n\n \n\nDuring feedstock development, no tubes were extruded. Instead, \n\nthe feedstock granules were warm pressed into disc-shaped samples of \n28 mm of diameter. The amount of granules pressed was calculated to \n\nproduce discs with thickness of 0.8 mm, however, due to feedstocks loss \nthrough the gaps between die and punchers, the thickness was slightly \nlower than that. The samples were pressed under 10 kN (corresponding \n\npressure of 163.9 bar) at various temperatures, weighted and their \ndensities were measured by the Archimedes method. \n\nDebinding of the disc samples was made in a tube furnace with \n\ncontrolled atmosphere. The debinding program was defined according to \nthe results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) used for the \n\ncharacterization of the binders. The following debinding atmospheres \nwere used under atmospheric pressure: \n\ni. Reducing \u2013 forming gas (N2 + 8%H2) with a flow rate of \n0.2 l/min; \n\nii. Oxidizing \u2013 air without forced flow; \n\nFigure 29 schematically shows the experimental procedure \n\nfollowed in the feedstock development. \n\n \nFigure 29 \u2013 Schematic diagram of the procedure used in the feedstock \n\ndevelopment. (a) Mixing, (b) granulation, (c) warm-pressing and (d) debinding. \n\n  \n\n\n\n102 \n \n\n3.2.1.1. Filling level definition and maximum filling level \ndetermination \n\nTo define the solid volume content and determine the maximum \n\nfilling level several feedstocks, with a simple binder system, composed \nof plain LDPE, were prepared. The solids content varied between 54 and \n62 vol.%, that is roughly the same range usually used in PIM \n\n(GERMAN, 1990). Mixing was carried out in the kneader at 152 \u00b0C. \nTo define the maximum filling level, in which viscosity \n\napproaches infinite, and so as the mixing torque, a relationship between \n\nthe solids-binder ratio and the inverse of mixing torque was used. This \nmethod was developed in the group of Clemens and is going to be \n\nshown in a later section. For this method, the torque data of unfilled \nLDPE, i.e. no powder addition, was also included. To validate the \nresults and the method, data was compared with different viscosity \n\nmodels. \nThe following characteristics were considered during the \n\ndefinition of the filling level: \n\ni. Mixing torque; \nii. Maximum filling level; \n\niii. Debinding behavior. \n\nMixing torque should not be too high, close to the limit of the \nkneader, because although the addition of paraffin wax in the binder \n\nsystem during binder system definition would reduce the torque, the \nfiber addition for tube extrusion would, on the contrary, increase it. \nWhat effect would be predominant was difficult to estimate, so that a \n\nsafety margin should be given. The defined filling level should also be, \nobviously, below the maximum filling level (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nAll samples were warm pressed at 140 \u00b0C under 10 kN \n\n(corresponding pressure of 163.9 bar). \nThe debinding behavior was analyzed considering the presence of \n\ndefects in the samples after the debinding cycle, such as deformation, \nedge rounding and blisters. \n  \n\n\n\n103 \n\n \n\n3.2.1.2. Binder system definition \n\nAfter defining the filling level, the binder system had to be \ndeveloped. A three component binder system composed by low density \n\npolyethylene (LDPE), paraffin wax (PW) and stearic acid (SA) was \nused. A multi-component binder system would, according to the \nliterature, permit faster debinding less prone to the formation of \n\ndebinding defects. \nAs surfactant, SA was used in a small amount, fixed in 5.0 vol.% \n\nof the total amount of binder, as used in many others similar PIM binder \n\nsystems (GERMAN, 1990). So what had to be investigated was the \nvolume fractions of LDPE and PW.  \n\nSeveral amounts of PW content were investigated varying from \nzero to 95 vol.%. SA was used in a fix value of 5 vol.%. The balance \nwas LDPE. \n\nThe warm pressing temperature was empirically determined in a \nway that perfect discs were produced. With too low temperatures, the \nfeedstock could not fill the mold properly, while with too high \n\ntemperatures an excess of flash was produced and material was lost \nthrough the gap of the mould. The temperature varied from 95 to 140 \n\n\u00b0C. Pressing was performed under 10 kN (corresponding pressure of \n163.9 bar). \n\nThe amount of PW was defined based on the debinding behavior, \n\ni.e. absence of deformation, edge rounding and blisters. \n\n3.2.2. Tube extrusion \n\nAfter feedstock development, 30 vol.% of Nextel\u2122 610 fibers \n\nwere incorporated into the solids content of feedstock, being the other \n70 vol.% alumina or IN718 powder. This amount was also fixed \naccording to previous studies for other CMCs and MMCs (CHAWLA, \n\n2003; CHAWLA, et al., 2006; SURESH, et al., 1993; MILEIKO, 1997). \nFigure 30 shows schematically the composition of the feedstock after \n\nbinder system definition and the introduction of fibers. \n\n\n\n104 \n \n\n \nFigure 30 \u2013 Schematic graphic of feedstock composition. Question marks \n\ndenote the amount to be defined during feedstock development. \n\nTube extrusion was also carried out in the capillary rheometer \n\nadapted with special tube production dies. Three different tube \ngeometries were produced as follows: \n\ni. 10.0 mm of external diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness; \nii. 10.0 mm of external diameter and 0.6 mm of thickness; \n\niii. 4.5 mm of external diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness. \n\nFigure 31 illustrates the three different tube geometries. \n\n \nFigure 31 \u2013 Sketch of the three different geometries of the \n\nextruded tubes. \n\n\n\n105 \n\n \n\nThe adapted capillary rheometer permitted the control of three \n\nprocess parameters: \n\ni. Cylinder temperature \u2013 ranging from temperatures under \nand above the LDPE melting temperature (108 \u00b0C); \n\nii. Die temperature \u2013 also ranging from under and above \nLDPE melting temperature; \n\niii. Extrusion piston speed \u2013 ranging from 0.39 to 2.00 \nmm/min. \n\nThe extrusion parameters were controlled until a perfect \n\nextrudate, without any visual defects, such as warping and extrudate \nfracture. After a perfect extrudate was produced, samples were analyzed \n\nby scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in order to check the fiber \nalignment. \n\n3.2.3. Tubes debinding \n\nTubes samples were cut, weighted and had their length measured \nprior to debinding. Priority was given to a simple program of thermal \ndebinding. Solvent debinding would have been used only in the case of \n\nfailure of the fully thermal debinding, i.e. appearance of debinding \ndefects, such as deformation and blisters. \n\nThermal debinding of the extruded tubes was performed \naccording to TGA analysis of the feedstock constituents.  \n\n3.2.3.1. Solvent debinding \n\nSolvent debinding was used to extract PW and SA before the \nthermal extraction of the backbone (LDPE). The samples were held in \nan ethanol bath at 60 \u00b0C for 5 hours. \n\nAfter solvent debinding, the samples were weighted to check the \npercentage of binder removed. Then a normal thermal debinding cycle \nwas used to extract the LDPE. \n\n\n\n106 \n \n\n3.2.4. Tubes sintering \n\nThe tubes were sintered in the same furnace used for thermal \ndebinding. All the tubes were sintered at 1300 \u00b0C for 60 minutes, with a \n\nheating rate of 5.0 \u00b0C/min. The temperature was chosen to provide a \ncertain degree of sintering without, though, damaging the Nextel\u2122 \nfibers that starts to degrade above 1300 \u00b0C (LEE, et al., 2003). For the \n\nsame reason, a short period of exposure to high temperature, 60 minutes, \nwas stipulated. At this temperature and time a porous structure, similar \n\nto those produced by WHIPOX\u2122 process, was expected to be produced \n(CHAWLA, 2003). The following sintering atmospheres were used \nunder atmospheric pressure: \n\ni. Reducing \u2013 forming gas (N2 + 8%H2) with a flow rate of \n0.2 l/min; \n\nii. Oxidizing \u2013 air (only for CMCs) without forced flow; \n\nAfter sintering samples were weighted and, afterwards, broken \n\ntransversally and parallelly to extrusion direction for SEM analysis. The \nsamples were broken instead of cut in order to expose the fibers on the \n\nsurface, making it easier to visualize their alignment. \n\n3.3. INSTRUMENTS \n\n3.3.1. Processing instruments \n\nFor the feedstock production and characterization a torque \nrheometer (kneader) Thermo Scientific model Haake PolyLab OS \nRheoDrive 4 was used. The chamber volume without the rotors was 120 \n\ncm\n3\n. The rotors used were Roller-Rotors R600 type, shown in Figure 32. \n\nWith these rotors the chamber effective volume was reduced to 69 cm\n3\n. \n\nThe maximum speed and maximum torque of this equipment was 250 \n\nRPM and 160 Nm, respectively. \n\n\n\n107 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 32 \u2013 Rotors used for mixing in the kneader. Rotors type: Roller-Rotors \n\nR600. \n\n \nThe disc-shaped samples were warm-pressed in a manual press \n\nfrom Paul-Otto Weber GmbH, model not specified, with a maximum \n\nforce of 200 kN. A cylindrical die with diameter of 28.0 mm was heated \nup to pressing temperature by means of a heating band with controlled \ntemperature. Figure 33 shows the die and punches used and Figure 34 \n\nshows the setup made for warm pressing, composed by press, die, \nheating band and temperature controller. \n\n \nFigure 33 \u2013 Picture of the die, upper punch (bigger) and \nlower punch (smaller) used for warm-pressing the disc-\n\nshaped samples. \n\n\n\n108 \n \n\n \nFigure 34 \u2013 Warm-pressing setup, showing the press and its \n\npiston, the heating band around the die, the force meter, \n\nchronometer, and temperature control unit. \n\nThe feedstock granulation and tube extrusion have been \n\nperformed in a capillary rheometer from Bohlin Instruments Rosand, \nmodel RH7 Flowmaster, shown in Figure 35. For granulation a die with \nlength of 28.0 mm, diameter of 1.0 mm and entrance angle of 0\u00b0 was \n\nused, see Figure 36. In the case of tube extrusion dies with an entrance \nangle of 45\u00b0, with 10.0 and 4.5 mm of diameter were used. Three \ndifferent pin diameters were used, 2.5 mm, 8.0 mm and 8.8 mm in \n\ncombination with the two dies to produce the three different tubes \ngeometries.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS \n\n4.1. MATERIALS CHARACTERIZATION \n\nThe IN718 and alumina powders were characterized as received. \n\nFigure 39 and Figure 40 show the SEM image of the IN718 (2\nnd\n\n batch)\n6\n \n\nand alumina powders respectively. \n\n \nFigure 39 \u2013 SEM images of IN718 powder in four different magnifications, \n10000, 5000, 2000 and 1000x. \n\nFrom the images is possible to see differences in morphology, \nsize and particle size distribution of the two different powders. Most of \n\nthe atomized IN718 particles have an almost perfect spherical shape, \n\n                                                         \n6\n As the morphological characteristics of the particles of the first and second batches were \n\nalmost identical, in the present work SEM images of only one of them were shown. \n\n\n\n114 \n \n\ndespite some irregular, yet rounded, particles are also present. On the \n\nother hand the particles of the alumina powder are overall of polygonal \nshape. Another evident difference is the mean size of the particles, \n\nwhich is larger for the IN718 powder. \n\n \nFigure 40 \u2013 SEM images of alumina powder in four different magnifications, \n\n10000, 5000, 2000 and 1000x. \n\nThe particle size and PSD of the powders were measured by a \nlaser light scattering particle size analyzer and the results can be seen in \nFigure 41 and Figure 42. Surprisingly a bimodal PSD was found for all \n\nthe powders, being more evident on the alumina powder. The particles \nfound in the submicrometric scale in the alumina powder might be an \nanalysis error due to the method used (Fraunhofer diffraction), which is \n\nnot the most adequate for ceramic particles. In the case of the metallic \npowder it is hard to say what is the reason for the detection of \n\nsubmicrometric particles. Helium pycnometry and BET analyses were \nalso performed and the results are summarized in Table 11. \n\n\n\n115 \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 41 \u2013 PSD analysis of the IN718 powder from \n\n2\nnd\n\n batch. \n\n \nFigure 42 \u2013 PSD analysis of the alumina powder. \n\nTable 11 \u2013 Results of helium pycnometry and BET analysis for the \n\ntwo different powders. \n\nPowder \nHe Pycnometer \n\nDensity (g/cm\n3\n) \n\nBET surface area \n\n(m\n2\n/g) \n\nIN718 (1\nst\n batch) 8.1924 0.229 \n\nIN718 (2\nnd\n\n batch) 8.1759 0.216 \n\nAlumina 4.0000 0.777 \n\nFigure 43 shows the SEM images of the Nextel\u2122 610 fibers. \nNote that the fibers have smooth surfaces but not perfectly cylinder-like \nshape, which cannot be clearly seen in these images. \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0,01 0,1 1 10 100\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nParticle Diameter (?m)\n\nIN718 (2nd lot)\n\nMean = 4.855 ?m\n\nMode = 6.452 ?m\n\nd10 = 2.83 ?m\n\nd50 = 5.73 ?m\n\nd90 = 9.38 ?m\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0,01 0,1 1 10 100\n\nV\no\n\nlu\nm\n\ne\n  \n\n(%\n)\n\nParticle Diameter (?m)\n\nAlumina\n\nMean = 0.937 ?m\n\nMode = 2.539 ?m\n\nd10 = 0.11 ?m\n\nd50 = 1.82 ?m\n\nd90 = 4.09 ?m\n\n\n\n116 \n \n\n      \nFigure 43 \u2013 SEM images of Nextel\u2122 610 alumina fibers. Magnification: 110 \nand 1000 x. \n\nThe temperature of degradation/evaporation of the binders was \ncharacterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Samples were \n\nanalyzed in a forming gas atmosphere, from room temperature to 600 \n\u00b0C, with a heating rate of 5.0 \u00b0C/min. The results are shown in Figure 44 \nto Figure 47. As it can be seen, both LDPE\u2019s evaporate/degrade at more \n\nor less the same temperature range, with maximum mass loss rate at 459 \n\u00b0C for LDPE70 and 470 \u00b0C for LDPE02. The LDPE\u2019s show the higher \nextraction temperatures and are completely removed close to 490 \u00b0C. \n\nParaffin wax and stearic acid show their maximum mass loss rate at 305 \nand 263 \u00b0C, respectively. Above 330 \u00b0C, nearly all paraffin wax is \n\nremoved, whereas most of stearic acid is removed at 270 \u00b0C. \n\n \nFigure 44 \u2013 Thermogravimetric analysis of LDPE70 in forming gas. \n\n-0,05\n\n0,00\n\n0,05\n\n0,10\n\n0,15\n\n0,20\n\n0,25\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n\nM\na\n\nss\n lo\n\nss\n r\n\na\nte\n\n (\n\u00b0C\n\n-1\n)\n\nM\na\n\nss\n (%\n\n)\n\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n\n\n\n117 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 45 \u2013 Thermogravimetric analysis of LDPE02 in forming gas. \n\n \nFigure 46 \u2013 Thermogravimetric analysis of PW in forming gas. \n\n-0,05\n\n0\n\n0,05\n\n0,1\n\n0,15\n\n0,2\n\n0,25\n\n0,3\n\n0,35\n\n0,4\n\n0,45\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n\nM\na\n\nss\n lo\n\nss\n r\n\na\nte\n\n (\n\u00b0C\n\n-1\n)\n\nM\na\n\nss\n (%\n\n)\n\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n\n-0,02\n\n0,00\n\n0,02\n\n0,04\n\n0,06\n\n0,08\n\n0,10\n\n0,12\n\n0,14\n\n0,16\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\n\nM\na\n\nss\n lo\n\nss\n r\n\na\nte\n\n (\n\u00b0C\n\n-1\n)\n\nM\na\n\nss\n (%\n\n)\n\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n\n\n\n118 \n \n\n \nFigure 47 \u2013 Thermogravimetric analysis of SA in forming gas. \n\n4.2. PRELIMINARY TESTS \n\n4.2.1. Alumina and IN718 feedstocks with plain LDPE70 \n\n4.2.1.1. Mixing \n\nThe starting point of the study was a feedstock with 54 vol.% of \nsolids a LDPE70 binder system. Figure 48 to Figure 51 show the plot of \n\nthe torque and temperature versus time during pre-mixing and mixing of \nthe nickel-based and alumina powders. The conditions of pre-mixing \nand mixing were the same for both powders, as described in the \n\nprevious section.  \nAs it can be seen in Figure 48 to Figure 51, the mixing of both \n\npowders followed a typical behavior (GERMAN, 1990), showing first \n\nan increase of torque, with a decrease of temperature as the materials \nwere introduced in the mixing chamber. As the temperature increased, \n\neither by the heating elements or by interparticle friction, the torque \ndecreased until a certain homogeneity level in which both torque and \ntemperature stabilized, which denotes good mixing.

The higher torque for the alumina powder, almost twice \n\nhigher, might be associated with the difference in powder \ncharacteristics, mainly particle size, PSD and powder shape (GERMAN, \n1990; SHENOY, 1999). The particle shape in this case is of great \n\nimportance, since the polygonal shape of alumina particles offers a \nmuch higher inter-particle friction than the round IN718 particles \n(GERMAN, 1990). Another factor may be related with surface physics, \n\ne.g. wetting, which induces a different interaction powder-binder, \ncausing lower or higher frictions. \n\n \nFigure 52 \u2013 Plot of mixing torque versus time of alumina and IN718 feedstocks \n\nwith 54 vol.% of solids and a plain LDPE70 binder system.

The difference of degradation kinetics under reducing and \noxidizing atmosphere is in agreement with the literature (GERMAN, \n\n1990). \n\n \nFigure 57 \u2013 Thermogravimetric analysis of alumina-LDPE70 \nbased feedstocks performed in forming gas and in air.

Figure 58 shows examples of IN718 and alumina warm-\n\npressed samples. Densities achieved were close to theoretical as shown \nin Table 13. The theoretical density was calculated with the densities \n\nand volumes of particles and binders used to produce the feedstocks, \nconsidering a total absence of voids. This table also shows the average \nthickness of the samples. Note that the thickness was lower than 0.8 \n\nmm, which was the calculated thickness according to the amount of \n\n\n\n126 \n \n\ngranules pressed. This happened due to loss of feedstocks through the \n\ngaps between die and punchers. \n\n \nFigure 58 \u2013 IN718 and alumina warm-pressed \n\nsamples. \n\nTable 13 \u2013 Density and thickness of warm pressed samples with a plain \nLDPE70 binder system and 54 vol.% of solids. \n\nFeedstock \n\nAverage \n\ndensity \n\n(g/cm\n3\n) \n\nTheoretical \n\ndensity \n\n(g/cm\n3\n) \n\nPercentage of \n\ntheoretical \n\ndensity (%) \n\nAverage \n\nthickness \n\n(mm) \n\nAlumina 2.561 \u00b1 0.014 2.5827 99.15 \u00b1 0.53 0.72 \u00b1 0.05 \n\nIN718 4.807 \u00b1 0.011 4.8466 99.18 \u00b1 0.24 0.75 \u00b1 0.04 \n\n \nFigure 59 and Figure 60 show the SEM images of the green \n\nwarm-pressed discs of alumina and IN718 powders, respectively.

Thermal debinding \n\nAccording to the TGA analyses of LDPE70 and the feedstocks, \nthe debinding program should be carried until a temperature of at least \n\n500 \u00b0C. To assure the complete binder removal, a basic program was \ndefined to be at 600 \u00b0C, with a heating rate of 0.5 \u00b0C/min and a dwell \ntime of 60 min. The low heating rate was defined to avoid as much as \n\npossible the formation of blisters, without however impractically \nextending the debinding cycle. \n\nDebinding of alumina samples was carried out in oxidizing \n\natmosphere (air) and in reducing atmosphere (forming gas), whereas \ndebinding of IN718 was performed only in reducing atmosphere. The \n\npictures of the samples after debinding are shown in Figure 61. As it can \nbe seen, the alumina sample submitted to debinding in air has shown a \nperfect defect-free sample, with no blisters, no deformation, no warping, \n\nno edge rounding and no color change. On the other hand, both alumina \nand IN718 discs, submitted to debinding in reducing atmosphere, \nunderwent edge rounding, deformation and blister formation. These \n\ndefects are more likely to happen in single component binder systems, \nsuch as the one used (GERMAN, 1990). The alumina sample debinding \n\nin forming gas has shown also a slight darkening due to carburization, \nwhich can also be seen in the alumina support (in the picture \nbackground). It is presumed that IN718 samples have also undergone \n\ncarburizing, since the binder system and debinding cycle were the same, \nhowever it is not visible due to the originally dark color of the IN718 \nfeedstock. \n\n       \n (a) (b) (c) \nFigure 61 \u2013 Picture of disc-shaped samples after thermal debinding. (a) Alumina \nin oxidizing atmosphere, (b) alumina in reducing atmosphere and (c) IN718 in \n\nreducing atmosphere. \n\nThe difference in debinding behavior in air and in forming gas \nwas somehow predicted, due to the difference observed in the TGA of \n\n\n\n129 \n\n \n\nalumina samples showed in Figure 57. As the evaporation/degradation \n\nrate of LDPE70 in air is lower and happens in a larger temperature \ninterval, it avoids the formation of blisters. Blisters happen when the \n\nrate of formation of vapor or degradation gases is faster than the rate of \ndiffusion of these gases through the compact towards the surface \n(GERMAN, 1990). \n\nEdge rounding, on the other hand, is related with the temperature \nin which debinding starts. As shown in Figure 57, for debinding in air, \npolymer extraction starts at 250 \u00b0C, whereas for debinding in forming \n\ngas considerable amount of polymer starts to be extracted just at 350 \u00b0C. \nConsidering a lower heating rate, 0.5 \u00b0C/min, when the material reaches \n\n350 \u00b0C in air, a great amount of binder, if not all of it, has already been \nremoved. When the debinding is carried in reducing atmosphere, at 350 \n\u00b0C nearly no binder has yet been removed and, as the viscosity of the \n\nbinder reduces drastically with temperature, deformation and edge \nrounding at such higher temperatures is much more likely to occur. \n\nMoreover edge rounding and deformation is also closely related \n\nwith the inter-particle friction. As the polygonal shape of the alumina \nparticles offers a much higher inter-particle friction than the round \n\nIN718 particles, the IN718 samples underwent considerably higher \ndeformation and edge rounding, as it can be seen in Figure 61c. \n\nAll programs have successfully removed all the binder. For the \n\ndebinding of the alumina sample in air, 100.00 % of binder was \nremoved\n\n7\n. In forming gas, 100.00 % and 98.53 % of the binder was \n\nremoved from the alumina and IN718 samples, respectively. \n\nFinally, various debinding programs were used to test the \npossibility of reducing defect formation during debinding of IN718 disc-\nshaped samples. Table 14 shows the programs used and images of the \n\nsamples afterwards. \nProgram #1 shows that an oxidizing atmosphere, although \n\ndetrimental to the metallic powder due to oxidation, reduces \ndeformation and eliminates blister formation. However, edge rounding \nstill occurred, which shows that this type of defect is more influenced by \n\nthe powder characteristics. \n  \n\n                                                         \n7\n The actual values of removed binder for the alumina samples after debinding in air and in \n\nforming gas were 102.51 % and 101.59 %, respectively. However the maximum amount of \n\nbinder passive to be removed is, obviously, 100.00 % and therefore this was the reported value \n\nfor both samples. \n\n\n\n130 \n \n\nTable 14 \u2013 Various debinding programs imposed to the IN718 disc-shaped \n\nsamples in the attempt to reduce defects formation during thermal debinding. \n\nThe parameters that differ from the basic program are highlighted.

The results \n\nwere roughly the same as for the basic program. \nThe idea of program #4 was to reduce the exposure time of the \n\nsample to high temperature before the extraction of the polymer was \ntriggered, in an attempt to reduce deformation and edge rounding. This \nprogram seemed to be effective and deformation was reduced; however \n\nanother type of defect occurred, and the sample showed a peeling defect. \nFinally program #5 has been made just to confirm that until 250 \n\n\u00b0C, temperature at which debinding of PW triggers, no deformation, \n\nedge rounding or blisters occur. \n\n4.2.2. Alumina feedstock with plain LDPE02 \n\nIn order to avoid the formation of defects during debinding, an \nalumina based feedstock with a LDPE02 was investigated. The proposal \nwas to check if the debinding defects, such as edge rounding, \n\ndeformation and, eventually, blisters formation would be reduced with \nthe use of a low melt flow index LDPE. \n\n4.2.2.1.

Warm-pressing \n\nAfter granulation, warm-pressed disc-shaped samples were also \nproduced for the alumina feedstock with LDPE02 as binder. This time, \n\nto achieve high densities and defect-free warm-pressed samples, a \nhigher pressing temperature (148 \u00b0C) had to be used. This happened \nbecause of the higher viscosity (lower melt flow index) and higher \n\nmelting point of LDPE02. Table 16 compares the characteristics of the \nwarm-pressed discs of alumina with LDPE02 and LDPE70 as binder. \nWhat is worthy to highlight here is the higher thickness of the LDPE02 \n\nsamples. This is related with the smaller amount of feedstock slipping \nthrough the gaps between die and punchers during warm-pressing, \n\nwhich is another consequence of the higher viscosity of LDPE02. \n\nTable 16 - Density and thickness of warm pressed alumina samples with plain \n\nLDPE70 and plain LDPE02 binder systems, with a solids load of 54 vol.%. \n\nBinder \n\nAverage \n\ndensity \n\n(g/cm\n3\n) \n\nTheoretical \n\ndensity \n\n(g/cm\n3\n) \n\nPercentage of \n\ntheoretical \n\ndensity (%) \n\nAverage \n\nthickness \n\n(mm) \n\nLDPE70 2.561 \u00b1 0.014 2.5827 99.15 \u00b1 0.53 0.72 \u00b1 0.05 \n\nLDPE02 2.565 \u00b1 0.006 2.5878 99.11 \u00b1 0.23 0.81 \u00b1 0.01 \n\n4.2.2.4. Debinding \n\nWarm-pressed samples of alumina feedstock with LDPE70 and \n\nLDPE02 binders were submitted to the basic debinding program at 600 \n\u00b0C, with a heating rate of 0.5 \u00b0C/min and a dwell time of 60 min, in \nforming gas. The program successfully removed 100.00 % of the binder \n\nin both samples, with LDPE70 and LDPE02\n8\n. Figure 68 shows the \n\npictures of both samples after debinding. As it can be seen, the use of \nLDPE02 did not help to remove the defects found in the samples with \n\nLDPE70, i.e. blisters, edge rounding and deformation, and both samples \nshowed apparently the same amount of such defects. The use of \n\nLDPE02 was thus discontinued and LDPE70, with lower viscosity \n(higher melt flow index), was the only polyethylene used as binder \n\n                                                         \n8\n Again the real calculated values of the binder removal was 101.70 % for the sample with \n\nLDPE70 and 101.27 % for the sample with LDPE02. \n\n\n\n137 \n\n \n\nfurther in this work. The selection of the LDPE with lower viscosity was \n\nnot to reach too high pressures during the extrusion of the tubes, whose \nfeedstocks would have incorporated fibers, which would by itself \n\nincrease the extrusion pressure. \n\n \n (a) (b) \n\nFigure 68 \u2013 Alumina discs with 54 vol.% of solids.

Filling level definition \n\nTo define the solid volume content, alumina has been chosen to \nbe the powder tested for two reasons. Firstly, an economical reason, the \n\nlower price and the larger amount of this powder available. The second \nreason, from an engineering point of view, was the higher viscosity of \nthe alumina feedstock with 54 vol.% of solids, compared with the \n\nviscosity of the IN718 feedstock shown in the preliminary tests. The \nhigher torque of the alumina feedstock could, eventually, limit the solid \ncontent to a level that the mixing torque would not exceed the \n\nequipment maximum permitted torque. Here it is worthy to remember \n\n\n\n138 \n \n\nthat both feedstocks, for alumina and IN718 powders, would have in the \n\nend the same characteristics, i.e. filling level and binder system \ncomposition. Plain LDPE70 was the only polymer used in the binder \n\nsystem for the filling level definition. \n\n4.3.1.1. Mixing \n\nThe range of solids volume content tested was, as mentioned \n\npreviously, 54, 56, 58, 60 and 62 vol.%. Figure 69 and Figure 70 show \nthe plot of the torque versus time during pre-mixing and final mixing of \nthe alumina powder with LDPE70. The conditions of pre-mixing and \n\nfinal mixing were the same for all filling levels as described in the \nprevious section. \n\n \nFigure 69 \u2013 Plot of mixing torque versus time during pre-mixing of alumina \nfeedstocks with 54, 56, 58, 60 and 62 vol.% of solids at 180 \u00b0C. \n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n (\nN\n\nm\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n62 vol.%\n\n60 vol.%\n\n58 vol.%\n\n56 vol.%\n\n54 vol.%\n\n\n\n139 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 70 \u2013 Plot of mixing torque versus time during final mixing of alumina \nfeedstocks with 54, 56, 58, 60 and 62 vol.% of solids at 152 \u00b0C. \n\nThe evolution of the mixing torque with increase of filling level \noccurred as expected, i.e. the higher the filling level, the higher the \n\nmixing torque (GERMAN, 1990). Another expected characteristic was \nthe level of noise in the curves that increased for higher filling levels, \nthat can be noticed clearly in the mixing curves of the feedstocks with \n\n60 and 62 vol.% of solids. The level of noise for increased filling levels \nis due to the increasing interaction of particles as they get closer to each \nother as the binder amount decreases. Figure 71 shows the average \n\ntorque of the final mixing and the corresponding error bars, which are \nassociated with the level of noise in the data. In Figure 70, the mixing \ntorque of the feedstock with 58 vol.% has overcome the mixing torque \n\nof the feedstock with 60 vol.%, however, the level of noise of the latter \nmay confuse the results, as shown by the error bars in Figure 71. \n\nMoreover, an error associated with the calibration of the machine may \nhave influenced the average torque of both curves, 58 and 60 vol.%. \n\n0\n\n4\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n (\nN\n\nm\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n62 vol.%\n\n60 vol.%\n\n58 vol.%\n\n56 vol.%\n\n54 vol.%\n\n\n\n140 \n \n\n \nFigure 71 \u2013 Average torque during final mixing versus filling level \nfor alumina feedstock with plain LDPE70. \n\n4.3.1.1.1. Maximum filling level calculation \n\nTo calculate the maximum filling level the volume content ratio \n\nbetween LDPE70 and Alumina powders (LDPE/Al2O3) was plotted \nversus 1/torque, as shown in Figure 72. The extrapolation of the line to \n\nthe point where the inverse of torque is equal to zero, i.e. torque is \ninfinite, gives the minimum LDPE/Al2O3 ratio where the amount of \nAl2O3 is maximum. The minimum LDPE/Al2O3 ratio value was \n\ncalculated with the regression equation of Figure 72. Table 17 shows the \nvalues of the inverse of torque and LDPE/Al2O3 ratio, including the \nextrapolated value. Using this method, the maximum filling level was \n\nfound to be 71.4 vol.% of solids. \n\n0,00\n\n2,00\n\n4,00\n\n6,00\n\n8,00\n\n10,00\n\n12,00\n\n14,00\n\n16,00\n\n52 54 56 58 60 62 64\n\nA\nv\n\ne\nr\na\n\ng\ne\n t\no\n\nr\nq\n\nu\ne\n (\nN\n\nm\n)\n\nFilling level (vol.%)\n\n\n\n141 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 72 \u2013 Regression curve and equation of LDPE/Al2O3 ratio \n\nversus inverse of torque. \n\nTable 17 \u2013 Solid load and torque data according to measured values and \n\ncalculated values according to regression equation from Figure 72. \n\nSolids load (vol.%) \nLDPE/Al2O3  volume \n\nratio (dimensionless) \nTorque (Nm) \n\nInverse of torque \n\n(N\n-1\n\nm\n-1\n\n) \n\n54.00 0.8519 5.94 0.168 \n\n56.00 0.7857 7.05 0.142 \n\n58.00 0.7241 9.93 0.101 \n\n60.00 0.6667 9.05 0.111 \n\n62.00 0.6129 13.2 0.076 \n\n71.4* 0.400* ? 0.000 \n\n* Extrapolated values according to regression equation. \n\n4.3.1.1.2. Viscosity models comparison \n\nFrom the various proposed viscosity models found in the \n\nliterature, six among the most cited models were chosen to be compared \nwith the torque data versus filling level discussed in the previous sub-\nsession. The chosen models were the following: \n\ni. Eilers\u2019 model \u2013 Equation 9; \nii. Mooney\u2019s model \u2013 Equation 10; \n\niii. Kriger and Dougherty\u2019s model \u2013 Equation 11; \niv.

Chong\u2019s model \u2013 Equation 13; \nvi. Quemada\u2019s model \u2013 Equation 14. \n\nNote that all these models correlate solids load and the apparent \n\nviscosity. In this work, no viscosity data was calculated, and the solids \nload was correlated with the mixing torque instead. It was thus assumed \nthat the torque and the apparent viscosity are directly proportional for \n\nthe feedstock in question. Moreover, for all the models the constant ?0 \nhad to be defined, which is the apparent viscosity of the unfilled binder. \nFor that a mixing run of plain LDPE70, under the same conditions of the \n\nfeedstock mixing, was made. The average torque for the plain LDPE70 \n\nwas 0.61 \u00b1 0.02 Nm. In the models the maximum filling level ?m, \ncalculated in the previous section, is also included. The remaining \n\nempirical constants of the models were arbitrarily chosen to best fit the \nresults. \n\nFigure 73 shows the plot of the fitted models and the measured \ntorque data as a function of the filling level. For low volume fractions \n(low filling levels), until approximately 0.3, all the models showed more \n\nor less the same behavior. From 0.3 on, Mooney\u2019s and Quemada\u2019s \nmodels exhibited a much faster torque increase with volume fraction. \nThe models of Chong, Krieger-Dougherty and Eilers have shown an \n\nalmost identical behavior. On its turn, the model of Frankel and Acrivos \nwas definitely the one that best fitted the results of the present work. \n\nFigure 74 show a detail from the curves of Figure 73 around the volume \nfraction of the measured data, to show the fitting of the models in this \nregion. \n\n\n\n143 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 73 \u2013 Plot of filling level versus mixing torque of alumina feedstocks \ncompared with various viscosity models. \n\n \nFigure 74 \u2013 Detail of the plot of filling level versus mixing torque of alumina \nfeedstocks compared with various viscosity models, in the region of the \n\nmeasured data. \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0 0,1 0,2 0,3 0,4 0,5 0,6 0,7 0,8\n\nA\nv\ne\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n T\n\no\nrq\n\nu\ne\n (\nN\n\nm\n)\n\nVolumetric fraction (cm3/cm3)\n\nMeasured torque data\n\nFrankel and Acrivos\n\nChong\n\nEilers\n\nQuemada\n\nKrieger-Dougherty\n\nMooney\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n0,45 0,5 0,55 0,6 0,65 0,7\n\nA\nv\ne\n\nra\ng\n\ne\n T\n\no\nrq\n\nu\ne\n (\nN\n\nm\n)\n\nVolumetric fraction (cm3/cm3)\n\nMeasured torque data\n\nFrankel and Acrivos\n\nChong\n\nEilers\n\nQuemada\n\nKrieger-Dougherty\n\nMooney\n\n\n\n144 \n \n\n4.3.1.2. Granulation \n\nGranulation was performed under the same conditions as before. \nDue to high abrasion effect of the feedstock, the o-ring around the \n\npiston, which avoids back-flow of the feedstock during granulation \n(extrusion), has broken during granulation of all different feedstocks, \nyielding no good results. For this reason these data were not considered \n\nin this work. \n\n4.3.1.3.

Debinding \n\nThe samples with different filling levels were submitted to the \n\nbasic debinding program. The program successfully removed 100.00% \nof the binder\n\n9\n in samples with filling level from 54 to 60 vol.%; the \n\nsample with 62 vol.% of solid had 99.70 % of the binder removed. \n\nFigure 75 shows the pictures of the samples after debinding. As it can be \n\n                                                         \n9\n The real calculated values were 100.53, 101.10, 100.20 and 100.25 % for the samples with \n\n54, 56, 58 and 60 vol.% of solids, respectively. \n\n\n\n145 \n\n \n\nseen, the filling level did not have any influence on the blisters. \n\nHowever, with increasing of filling level, edge rounding has been \nsignificantly improved. The sample with 62 vol.% of solids showed no \n\nedge rounding. Based on these results, the filling level was defined to be \n62 vol.% for further studies in the present work. This value is also much \nlower than the calculated maximum filling level (71.4 vol.%), which is \n\ngood to avoid amplified volume errors due to weighting errors \n(GERMAN, 1990), as shown in Figure 16. The optimal filling level \nshould have 2 to 5 vol.% less powder than the maximum filling level \n\n(GERMAN, 1990); however, as fibers would be introduced in the \nsystem afterwards, and the high aspect ratio of the fibers would decrease \n\nthe maximum filling level (GERMAN, 1990), it was decided to keep the \nfilling level at 62 vol.%, which is about 9.6 vol% lower than the \ncalculated maximum filling level. \n\n   \n (a) (b) (c) \n\n  \n (d) (e) \nFigure 75 \u2013 Alumina discs with filling levels of (a) 54, (b) 56, (c) 58, (d) 60 and \n\n(e) 62 vol.% after debinding program. \n\n4.3.2.

As it can be seen, the influence of PW on the mixing \ntorque is very high, and with 20 vol.% the mixing torque, for both \n\nalumina and IN718 feedstocks, have drop to roughly one third of the \ntorque without PW. The torque keeps decreasing fast with addition of \nPW until an amount of 47.5 vol.%, i.e. LDPE/PW ratio equals to unit. \n\nAfter that, the feedstock viscosity is approximately the same as a \nfeedstock composed only of PW (95 vol.%) and SA (5 vol.%). \n\n \nFigure 79 \u2013 Evolution of mixing torque with increase of PW volume content \n\nand corresponding decrease of LDPE70 content.

Thermal debinding \n\nAlumina and IN718 warm-pressed discs with the different binder \nsystems, summarized in Table 20, were submitted to the basic thermal \n\ndebinding program in forming gas atmosphere. Table 21 shows the \npercentage of binder removed from all discs. As it can be seen, the \ndebinding process successfully removed almost all the binder of the \n\ndiscs. A lower percentage of binder removal from the IN718 discs may \nbe attributed to a slight oxidation of the samples, which increases the \nweight of the metallic powder. The weight increment input an error in \n\nthe calculation of the binder removal percentage that is made by \nweighting of the samples. This explains the lower binder removal value \n\nof the IN718 sample with 47.5 vol.% of PW. For this sample, the o-ring \nthat seals the furnace probably have not been correctly positioned, \nallowing more oxygen entering the furnace and contaminating the \n\natmosphere. \n\nTable 21 \u2013 Percentage of binder removed from alumina and \n\nIN718 discs with different binder systems. \n\nPowder PW content (vol.%) Binder removed (%) \n\nAlumina 0 99.91 \n\nAlumina 20 99.11 \nAlumina 25 99.17 \n\nAlumina 30 99.33 \nAlumina 39 99.12 \n\nAlumina 47.5 99.58 \n\nIN718 0 96.66 \nIN718 20 95.18 \n\nIN718 25 95.30 \nIN718 30 94.55 \n\nIN718 39 94.23 \n\nIN718 47.5 87.59 \n\nFigure 82 and Figure 83 show the discs after the debinding \n\nprocess. As it can be seen, the introduction of PW and SA in the binder \nsystem solved the problem of blister formation. This happened because \nthe removal of binder occurred in two steps. First, the SA and PW were \n\nremoved at temperatures around 260 and 300 \u00b0C, respectively, leaving a \nporous structure behind that allows the free flow of LDPE degradation \n\n\n\n152 \n \n\ngases, which are produced in the second step of the thermal debinding, \n\nat temperatures around 460 \u00b0C. \nIt can also be seen that the minimum amount of PW for alumina \n\nand IN718 feedstocks is different, 25 vol.% for the alumina feedstock \nand 30 vol.% for IN718 feedstocks. Below these values blisters starts to \ndisrupt on the surface of the samples. The different limits of PW content \n\nare correlated with the difference in powder morphology and PSD \nwhich leads to a different powder packing factor (GERMAN, 1990), \nprobably denser for the IN718 powder. Denser packing makes \n\ndebinding slower for the IN718 powder, which makes the samples of \nthis powder more prone to blister formation. With this results the PW \n\nvolume content has being defined to 30 vol.% of the binder system, so \nthat both alumina and IN718 show no blister formation during \ndebinding. This result is in agreement with what is found in the \n\nliterature, which states that a minimum of 30 vol.% of low molecular \nbinder should be used to form a sufficient interconnected network, \nalloying efficient solvent debinding, which could later provide an \n\ninterconnected porous network for the subsequent thermal debinding \n(GERMAN, 1990). \n\n     \n (a) (b) (c) \n\n     \n (d) (e) (f) \nFigure 82 \u2013 Alumina discs after debinding process in forming gas atmosphere. \n\nFeedstocks have the following PW content: (a) 47.5, (b) 39, (c) 30, (d) 25, (e) \n\n20 and (f) 0 (zero) vol.%. \n\n\n\n153 \n\n \n\n     \n (a) (b) (c) \n\n     \n (d) (e) (f) \nFigure 83 \u2013 IN718 discs after debinding process in forming gas atmosphere. \n\nFeedstocks have the following PW content: (a) 47.5, (b) 39, (c) 30, (d) 25, (e) \n\n20 and (f) 0 (zero) vol.%. \n\n4.3.3. Ultimate extrusion feedstock \n\nWith the results of the two previous sections the extrusion \nfeedstock was defined to be as shown graphically in Figure 84. For the \nultimate extrusion feedstocks 30 vol.% of Nextel\u2122 610 fibers were \n\nincorporated in the solids content. \n\n \nFigure 84 \u2013 Schematic graphic representing the ultimate extrusion feedstock \n\ncomposition. \n\n4.3.3.1. Mixing \n\n\n\n154 \n \n\nFigure 85 and Figure 86 show the pre-mixing torque of the \n\nultimate alumina and IN718 feedstocks with Nextel\u2122 fibers. For both \nfeedstocks, the pre-mixing curves show a different behavior than \n\npreviously observed for the feedstocks without fibers. This can be seen \nin the stabilization time that is much longer, with a torque decrease \nduring almost all pre-mixing time. This is associated with fiber breaking \n\nduring mixing, i.e. as the fibers break and have their average length \ndecreased, the mixing torque decreases correspondently. \n\nFigure 87 and Figure 88 compare the final mixing torque of the \n\nfeedstocks with and without fibers, for alumina and IN718 feedstocks, \nrespectively. The compared feedstocks have the same binder system, i.e. \n\n65 vol.% of LDPE, 30 vol.% of PW and 5 vol.% of SA. As expected, \nthe feedstocks with fibers show higher mixing torque than their \ncorrespondent feedstocks without fibers. Nevertheless this effect was \n\nmore evident for the IN718 feedstocks, for which the mixing torque has \nalmost doubled and remained higher after mixing for 40 minutes. \n\nFor the alumina feedstock, the mixing torque started higher, \n\nhowever, fiber breakage has still occurred during final mixing, leading \nto a torque decrease until the end of mixing. In the end the mixing \n\ntorque of the alumina feedstocks with and without fibers were nearly the \nsame. It seems that the particle-particle friction and particle-fiber \nfriction are of the same magnitude when the fibers break to shorter \n\nlengths. This effect that is observed for the alumina feedstock but not for \nthe IN718 feedstock may be related with the powder composition, but \nalso with the powder morphology and particle size distribution, which \n\nare all different comparing both powders. \nNevertheless it should be also emphasized that the mixing torque \n\nof the feedstock without fiber has also shown an unusual increase of \n\nmixing torque during the last minutes, what cannot be clearly explained \nand this contributes to the equalization of torque for the feedstocks with \n\nand without fibers. Normally a feedstock should show a thixotropic \nbehavior (GERMAN, 1990), i.e. exhibits a decrease in shear stress with \ntime at constant shear rate, but in this case a rheopectic behavior has \n\nbeen observed. \n\n\n\n155 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 85 \u2013 Plot of pre-mixing torque and pre-mixing temperature versus time \nof the ultimate alumina feedstock with Nextel\u2122 fibers. \n\n \nFigure 86 \u2013 Plot of pre-mixing torque and pre-mixing temperature versus time \nof the ultimate IN718 feedstock with Nextel\u2122 fibers. \n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n (\n\u00b0C\n\n)\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n (\nN\n\nm\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\n\nT\ne\n\nm\np\n\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n (\n\u00b0C\n\n)\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n (\nN\n\nm\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n\n\n156 \n \n\n \nFigure 87 \u2013 Plot of final mixing torque versus time of the ultimate alumina \nfeedstock with Nextel\u2122 fibers in comparison with the correspondent alumina \n\nfeedstock without fibers. \n\n \nFigure 88 \u2013 Plot of final mixing torque versus time of the ultimate IN718 \n\nfeedstock with Nextel\u2122 fibers in comparison with the correspondent IN718 \n\nfeedstock without fibers. \n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n (\nN\n\nm\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\nwith fibers\n\nwithout fibers\n\nAverage torque in the last 5 minutes:\nwith fibers = 1.69 Nm\n\nwithout fibers = 1.59 Nm\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45\n\nT\no\n\nrq\nu\n\ne\n (\nN\n\nm\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\nwith fibers\n\nwithout fibers\n\nAverage torque in the last 5 minutes:\nwith fibers = 1.13 Nm\n\nwithout fibers = 0.65 Nm\n\n\n\n157 \n\n \n\nFigure 89 and Figure 90 show the TGA results of the ultimate \n\nalumina and IN718 feedstocks with fibers.

TUBES EXTRUSION \n\nThe extrusion of tubes has been performed with the ultimate \nalumina and IN718 feedstocks developed and showed in the previous \n\nsections. The following sections describe the approach to achieve \nuniform and visually defect-free tubes produced via extrusion. As \nmentioned before, extrusion was carried out in a capillary rheometer \n\nadapted with tube extruding dies in three different configurations, \nallowing the production of three different tube geometries. \n\nAs the extrusion equipment was relatively simply built, only two \n\nparameters could be controlled, namely cylinder temperature and piston \nspeed. A third parameter, die temperature, has also been investigated, \n\nhowever, no electronic automated control was originally built in the \nmachine, and a cooling setup with the use of a refrigerant fluid, has been \nadapted, which has given the die temperature two states, cooled and not \n\ncooled. The control of these three parameters, which is going to be \ndiscussed in the following sections, was the most important aspect on \nthe extrusion optimization, and has been done mainly in an empirical \n\nway. \n\n4.4.1. Cylinder temperature control \n\nThe cylinder temperature has been set in six different \ntemperatures: 90, 95, 100, 110, 120 and 140 \u00b0C. Considering the melting \npoint of the high molecular polymer, LDPE70, that is 108 \u00b0C, the \n\ntemperature varied from below to above the melting point of this \npolymer, which is the backbone of the system. Thus the tubes were \nextruded in the solid and molten states. The solid state extrusion is of \n\nindustrial practice and is only possible with plunger type extruders \n(RAUWENDAAL, 1986), with a configuration similar to the adapted \ncapillary rheometer used in the present work. \n\nWith this temperature variation, differences were expected on the \nsurface finishing of the tubes, as well as some deformation and, of \n\ncourse, differences on extruding pressures. During the control of \ncylinder temperature, no die cooling has been applied and the piston \nspeed was fixed at 1.0 mm/min. \n\nThe first aspect noticed was that there was no possibility to \nextrude the tubes at 140 \u00b0C. The viscosity of the feedstock in the exit of \n\n\n\n161 \n\n \n\nthe die was so low at such high temperature, that the tubes were \n\ncollapsing, and any attempt to improve the process, reducing for \nexample the extruding speed, was useless. So without controlling the die \n\ntemperature, extrusion was only possible at low temperatures, close to \nthe melting point of the backbone. \n\nThe second aspect observed was that the cylinder temperature \n\naffects tremendously the extrusion pressure. Figure 92 shows the \ninfluence of cylinder temperature on extruding pressure for alumina \ntubes with 10.0 mm of diameter and 0.6 mm of wall thickness, with \n\npiston speed of 1.00 mm/min. The figure shows that the pressure \ndecreases drastically with increasing temperatures. Very low pressures, \n\nbelow 1.0 MPa, could be achieved at temperatures above the melting \npoint of the backbone polymer. The low pressures reflect the very low \nviscosity of the feedstock at such temperatures, which makes difficult \n\nthe maintenance of extrudate shape once it exits the die. Moreover low \npressures imply low shear rates that could possibly not be sufficient to \nalign the fibers properly. \n\n \nFigure 92 \u2013 Plot of extrusion pressure versus cylinder temperature of alumina \ntubes with 10.0 mm of diameter and 0.6 mm of wall thickness.

This is because of the \ndifference in the thermal expansion of the binders and particles, which \n\nmakes the feedstock much more thermal sensitive than the unfilled \nbinders (GERMAN, 1990). \n\n \nFigure 93 \u2013 Arrhenius plot of the natural logarithm of extrusion pressure P \n\nversus the inverse of extrusion temperature T.

Temperatures above 120 \n\n\u00b0C, which is above the melting point of the backbone, have yielded \ntubes with rough surface and banana shape (warping).

The tubes were extruded with a piston speed of 1.00 \n\nmm/min, with no die temperature control. \n\nOn the other hand, extrusion at temperatures below or close to the \nmelting point of the backbone resulted in tubes with polished surface, \nhowever with two other surface defects: (a) fish scale, also known as \n\nbamboo (RAUWENDAAL, 1986), and (b) stains, which are similar to \nthe surface defect known as shark skin, associated with both extrusion \n\ntemperature and speed (RAUWENDAAL, 1986).

The tubes were extruded with a piston speed of 1.00 \n\nmm/min, with no die temperature control. \n\n\n\n164 \n \n\n4.4.2. Die temperature control \n\nAs already mentioned, the equipment used in this work had no \ndie temperature control. Without any cooling, the die achieved roughly \n\nthe same temperature of the cylinder. As showed in the previous section, \nno matter what temperature of the cylinder has been used, tubes with \ndifferent defects have been produced and no defect-free product has \n\nbeen achieved this way. \nTo solve this problem, a refrigerant fluid has been used to cool \n\ndown the die. For that, a beaker full of fluid was positioned right under \n\nthe die exit, in a way that the refrigerant fluid was in permanent contact \nwith the die, just as it is shown in Figure 96. Water and ethanol have \n\nbeen chosen as refrigerants, being the former used exclusively with \nalumina tubes and the latter for both alumina and IN718 tubes, to avoid \noxidation of the nickel alloy in water. \n\n      \n (a) (b) \nFigure 96 \u2013 Pictures of die cooling setup showing: (a) the refrigerant fluid \n(ethanol) inside the beaker in contact with the extrusion die to reduce its \n\ntemperature; and (b) detail of the die submerged in the ethanol bath and the \n\nalumina extrudate exiting the die. \n\nWith this setup it was possible to cool the lower part of the die \n\ndown to the boiling temperature of the chosen refrigerant fluid, i.e. 100 \n\n\n\n165 \n\n \n\n\u00b0C for water and 78 \u00b0C for ethanol. So what has been done was to set \n\nthe cylinder to high temperature, i.e. above melting point of LDPE, and \ncool the die end with the refrigerant. \n\nAlthough using the die cooling setup the die end could be kept at \na temperature close to the boiling point of water or ethanol, the die \nentrance had still roughly the same temperature of the cylinder. This \n\nmeans that the feedstock was being shaped into the die in the molten \nstate, and only in the very end of the die, where no more shape change \nwas imposed to the feedstock, the extrudate was cooled down below the \n\nmelting point of the backbone, but still inside the die. With this the \nsurface finishing of the extrudate should be the same as the surface \n\nfinishing of the die walls, in a process close to solid state extrusion, in \nwhich a much better surface quality is also attained (RAUWENDAAL, \n1986). Moreover, an increase in pressure has been experienced with the \n\nuse of the die cooling setup, related the higher friction between the \nsolidified extrudate and the die walls. Higher pressures lead to a more \ncompacted extruded structure, with higher particle contact, which \n\nincreases the shape stability, especially during debinding and sintering. \nOn the other hand a more compacted extruded structure may also have \n\nresidual stresses that would be detrimental to shape maintenance during \nreheating. \n\nThe results seemed much better with the use of this setup, even \n\nallowing the temperature of the cylinder to be set as high as 140 \u00b0C, \nwhat was impracticable without cooling the die. Some results can be \nseen in Figure 97. The tubes produced without the use of the die cooling \n\nsetup have a rough surface and show a banana shape deformation, \ndefects that are solved with the use of the cooling setup. \n  \n\n\n\n166 \n \n\n   \n (a) (b) \n\n    \n (c) (d) \nFigure 97 \u2013 Pictures of tubes produced without and with the setup for cooling \nthe die.

All tubes were extruded with a piston speed of 1.00 mm/min. All \ntubes have 10.0 mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness. \n\n4.4.3. Piston speed control \n\nThe influence of piston speed on extrusion pressure is shown on \n\nFigure 98. As it can be seen the pressure inside the cylinder increases \nmore or less proportionally with the increase of piston speed until a \npiston speed of 2.00 mm/min. Above this speed the pressure seems not \n\nto increase relevantly, which may be related with the shear thinning \nbehavior (pseudoplasticity) of the feedstock. \n\n\n\n167 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 98 \u2013 Plot of extrusion pressure versus piston speed of \nIN718 tubes with 10.0 mm of diameter and 0.6 mm of wall \n\nthickness extruded at 120 \u00b0C using the die cooling setup with \n\nethanol. \n\nThe influence of piston speed on the extrudate has shown to be on \n\nboth surface finishing and shape maintenance. Extrusion speed is \ndirectly proportional to the piston speed. It was observed that the lower \nthe extrusion speed, the better is the surface and lower is the curvature \n\nof the banana shape defect. \nTo make it clear, piston speed is the velocity with which the \n\npiston presses the feedstock against the die during the extrusion process. \n\nPiston speed is set by the operator and controlled automatically by the \ndevice. Extrusion speed is the velocity with which the feedstock is \n\nextruded, i.e. the velocity of tube production, and depends on the piston \nspeed, piston section area and die section area. Larger die section areas \nallow higher volumes of material to be extruded, producing thus, for a \n\ncertain piston speed, lower extrusion speeds. Smaller die section areas \nallow lower volumes of materials to be extruded, producing, for the \nsame piston speed, higher extrusion speeds. \n\nA simple geometric analysis was used to estimate the extrusion \nspeed as a function of piston speed. No extrudate swell or viscoelastic \n\nbehavior of the feedstock was included in the calculation, which gives \nonly an approximate value as a reference. \n\nThe volume of feedstock displaced by the piston VP depends on \n\nthe piston speed vP, piston section area AP and time t, according to \nEquation 17. \n\n0,00\n\n0,50\n\n1,00\n\n1,50\n\n2,00\n\n2,50\n\n0,00 1,00 2,00 3,00 4,00 5,00\n\nP\nre\n\ns\ns\nu\n\nre\n (\nM\n\nP\na\n)\n\nPiston speed (mm/min)\n\n\n\n168 \n \n\nEquation 17             \n\nIn the same way, the extruded volume VE depends on the \nextrusion speed vE, die section area AD and time t, according to Equation \n\n18. \n\nEquation 18            \n\nBut the extruded feedstock volume VE is equivalent to the \nfeedstock volume displaced by the piston VP: \n\nEquation 19       \n\nSo, substituting Equation 17 on Equation 18: \n\nEquation 20                  \n\nThen vE is given by: \n\nEquation 21    \n     \n\n  \n \n\nEquation 21 shows that the extrusion speed vE is directly \nproportional to the piston speed vP and inversely proportional to the die \n\nsection area AD.

With a piston speed vP of 1.00 mm/min it was \npossible to produce defect-free tubes with the die of 10.0 mm of \n\ndiameter and 1.0 mm of thickness, as shown before in Figure 97. \nHowever, using the same piston speed for the other two dies, fish scale \nand banana shape defects were evident on the tubes, as it can be seen in \n\nFigure 99. \n\n     \n (a) (b) \n\n      \n (c) (d) \nFigure 99 \u2013 Picture of tubes extruded with piston speed of 1.00 mm/min.

It can be seen that tubes with high length/diameter \nratio could be extruded. Tubes longer than 15 cm were not produced due \nto mere limitation of the ethanol beaker height. \n\n  \n\n\n\n173 \n\n \n\n           \n (a) (b) (c) \nFigure 101 \u2013 Pictures of defect-free tubes extruded under the ultimate extrusion \nconditions.

(c) IN718 [gray] and \n\nalumina [white] tubes with 4.5 mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness. \n\nNo extruded tube showed the effect of extrudate swell. According \nto what could be found in the literature, the reasons for this phenomenon \nnot to occur are the following: \n\ni. Low die-end temperature \u2013 as the die end is at a \ntemperature below the melting point of the backbone, \nwhich is the main binder of the system, its molecules are \n\nalready with too low mobility by the time the extrudate \nleaves the die. This is what happens in solid state \n\nextrusion, which also shows virtually no extrudate swell \n(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\nii. Low extrusion speed \u2013 molecular alignment is associated \nwith high shear rates, which on its turn happens under \nhigh extrusion speeds. With low degree of alignment of \nthe molecules, a lower elastic recover shall occur \n\n(CHEREMISINOFF, 1987). Moreover, even if the \nmolecules could have been sufficiently aligned, the long \n\nresidence time inside the die avoided the elastic recover \nthat is time-dependent and can only occur after a limited \ntime subsequent to the undergone deformation \n\n(RAUWENDAAL, 1986). \n\n\n\n174 \n \n\niii. Low molecular weight binders \u2013 the considerable amount \nof PW and SA, which are binders with short chains, must \nhave diminished the amount of extrudate swell which is \n\nproportional to molecule length (CHEREMISINOFF, \n1987). \n\niv. Nextel\u2122 fibers content \u2013 the alumina fibers, which have \na relative high rigidity, could have also worked as \nanchors, refraining the elastic recover. \n\nFigure 102 and Figure 103 show the SEM images of the \n\nlongitudinal section of the alumina and IN718 green tubes, respectively. \nIn the images, it can be seen the good fiber alignment of the Nextel\u2122 \n\nfibers in the direction of extrusion. This evidence shows that the shear \nrate was high enough to produce fiber alignment, although it was not \nsufficient to align the molecules. \n\n      \n (a) Extrusion direction ?

The samples have been broken \n\ntransversally, to avoid fiber cutting that would happen using any cutting \ninstrument. In Figure 103b, it can be seen the original sites of fibers that \nhave been pulled out during sample breakage. Note that at these sites \n\nsome particles emerge from the binder, indicating that, before \ndebinding, good particle-particle and particle-fiber contact already \nexisted due to the high filling level used (62 vol.%). Another important \n\n\n\n175 \n\n \n\nfact observed in the SEM images is that the fibers, once 30 mm long, \n\nhave been broken during kneading down to lengths of approximately 0.5 \nmm. \n\n      \n (a) Extrusion direction ?

TUBES DEBINDING AND SINTERING \n\nIn this section the steps of debinding and sintering were put \n\ntogether for a reason. With the disc-shaped samples it was noticed that, \nafter debinding at 600 \u00b0C, the green strength of the samples was too low \nfor any handling. Every attempt to handle the samples and remove them \n\nfrom the alumina support has resulted on sample fracture. Thus, to avoid \nany tube fracture, all the samples have been sintered directly after \nthermal debinding. \n\nThe sintering program for all samples was from 600 to 1300 \u00b0C, \nwith a heating rate of 5 \u00b0C/min and a dwell time of 60 min at 1300 \u00b0C. \n\n4.5.1. Thermal debinding and sintering without previous solvent \ndebinding \n\nAs the warm-pressed discs have presented good results with fully \n\nthermal debinding, the first approach for tube debinding was a simple \n\n\n\n176 \n \n\nthermal cycle. So just like the warm-pressed samples, the tubes were \n\nsubmitted to the basic thermal debinding program and subsequently \nsintered at 1300 \u00b0C in forming gas atmosphere. \n\nThe thermal debinding and sintering program has successfully \nremoved 100.47 \u00b1 3.31% of the binder of the alumina tubes\n\n10\n. In the \n\ncase of IN718 tubes, a mass gain apparently due to oxidation, \n\ncarburization or even nitriding, has disguised the effect of binder \nremoval, so that the calculated binder removal by weight loss was only \nof 59.95 \u00b1 6.18%, which might not be true and a value close to 100% \n\nwould be the reality. The hypothesis of oxidation is going to be \ndiscussed further on. \n\n       \n (a) (b) (c) \nFigure 104 \u2013 Picture of alumina tubes after thermal debinding and sintering in \n\nforming gas.

All samples have undergone \nunacceptable deformation. The IN718 tubes have undergone the most \n\nsevere deformation, collapsing completely. \nAlumina tubes were also submitted to thermal debinding and \n\nsintering in air. But the results were not better, as it can be seen in \n\nFigure 106. The measured binder removal in this case was 98.11 \u00b1 \n0.90%. Again the tubes have undergone deformation, except the tube \nwith 4.5 mm of diameter (c), that seemed to have undergone no \n\ndeformation. Nevertheless these results were unacceptable and to solve \nthe problem a solvent debinding step was proposed. \n\n     \n (a) (b) (c) \nFigure 106 - Picture of alumina tubes after thermal debinding and sintering in \n\nair. (a) 10.0 mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness; (b) 10.0 mm of diameter \n\nand 0.6 mm of thickness and (c) 4.5 mm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness. \nThe dark edges of tubes (a) and (b) are contamination originated from the \n\ncutting disc. The curvature of the tube (c) is not related with the debinding and \nsintering, but was already present on the green tube. \n\n4.5.2. Solvent debinding followed by thermal debinding and \nsintering \n\nIn order to diminish the deformation during thermal debinding, \nthe samples were submitted to a cycle of solvent debinding. Ethanol \n\nheated at 60 \u00b0C was used as solvent. The samples were submerged in \nethanol bath for 5 hours. Solvent debinding was able to remove 90.96 \u00b1 \n4.35 % and 92.44 \u00b1 3.17 % of the low molecular weight binders of the \n\nalumina and IN718 tubes, respectively.  \nSamples of the tubes after solvent debinding were analyzed via \n\nSEM. The comparative images are shown in Figure 107 and Figure 108. \n\n\n\n178 \n \n\nThe microstructure of the alumina tubes after solvent debinding did not \n\nhave significant alterations, except some channels that seem to have \nappeared after solvent debinding, but are somewhat confused with some \n\ncracks originated during the transversal breakage of the sample. On the \nother hand, for the IN718 tubes, a noticeable difference on the \nmicrostructure is evident and a more porous structure is observed after \n\nsolvent debinding. This shows that solvent debinding was fulfilling its \nrole on letting a porous structure with channels, allowing the backbone \npolymer to be easily extracted by thermal evaporation/degradation. \n\n    \n (a) (b) \nFigure 107 \u2013 SEM images of extruded alumina tubes (a) before solvent \ndebinding and (b) after solvent debinding.

Magnification: 5000x. \n\nAfter solvent debinding, the samples were submitted to thermal \ndebinding and sintering the same way as in the previous section. The \n\n\n\n179 \n\n \n\nalumina tubes submitted to thermal debinding and sintering in forming \n\ngas had 97.58 \u00b1 2.30% of the binder removed. The IN718 tubes had \nagain the same problem of weight gain previously discussed, most \n\nprobably due to oxidation, carburization or nitriding, and the calculated \nvalue of binder removal, which might be false, was only 60.46 \u00b1 4.02%. \nAlumina tubes were also submitted to thermal debinding and sintering \n\nunder air atmosphere and had 100.22 \u00b1 4.09% of the binder removed\n11\n\n. \nFigure 109 and Figure 110 show pictures of alumina and IN718 \n\ntubes after solvent debinding, thermal debinding and sintering in \n\nforming gas. Figure 111 shows pictures of alumina tubes after thermal \ndebinding and sintering in air atmosphere. As it can be seen, solvent \n\ndebinding was indeed helpful on avoiding deformation during thermal \ndebinding. All the alumina tubes, submitted to thermal debinding and \nsintering, both in forming gas and air atmosphere have undergone no \n\ndeformation. \nIn the case of the IN718 tubes, only the smallest tube, with 4.5 \n\nmm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness, has not deformed during \n\nthermal debinding and sintering. The tube with 10.0 mm diameter with \nthicker wall (1.0 mm thick) shows a much lower deformation comparing \n\nwith the sample without solvent debinding, but still a certain amount of \ndeformation is evident. The tube with thinner wall (0.6 mm thick) has \ndeformed considerably more than the thicker one. In fact the sphericity \n\nof the IN718 particles, which is much higher than the alumina particles, \nmakes the tubes of the former much more likely to undergo deformation \nduring thermal debinding (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nAnother reason for the deformation during thermal debinding \ncould be related with the too low evaporation/degradation temperature \nof the backbone (around 450 \u00b0C). At this temperature, virtually no neck \n\nwas formed before the last LDPE molecules were removed. Efficient \nthermal debinding should allow the backbone to be removed at the onset \n\nof the sintering temperature of the powder, so that sintering necks would \nprovide strength to the compact before the backbone is completely \nremoved (GERMAN, 1990). Nevertheless this is only possible with low \n\ntemperature metallic alloys. For refractory alloys, such as nickel \nsuperalloys, and ceramics, the onset of sintering temperature is far \nbeyond the degradation temperature of the available polymers. \n\n                                                         \n11\n\n Idem note 10. \n\n\n\n180 \n \n\n           \n (a) (b) (c) \nFigure 109 \u2013 Picture of alumina tubes after solvent debinding, thermal \n\ndebinding and sintering in forming gas.

The dark edges of the tubes are \n\ncontamination originated from the cutting disc. \n\nSome attempts have been made to diminish the deformation of \nIN718 tubes by means of changing the thermal debinding program. \nFaster heating rates trials have been made under the reasoning that \n\nholding the sample longer times above the melting point of the \nbackbone would produce higher deformation. Besides, at higher heating \nrates, the binder removal should happen at higher temperatures, shifting \n\nthe thermal debinding to temperatures closer to the onset of sintering, so \nthat neck formation would increase the stability of the compact \n\n(GERMAN, 1990; GERMAN, 2005). \nTable 26 shows the different programs tried and the picture of the \n\nsamples after the tests. No program has succeeded. For test #3 the \n\nheating rate has been increased only on the beginning of the heating \nramp, avoiding the unnecessarily long exposure time above the melting \npoint of LDPE and below the extraction temperature range. Above 350 \n\n\u00b0C, when the LDPE started to be extracted, the heating rate was \ndecreased to the standard 0.5 \u00b0C/min. This program has also failed, \n\nmaking it evident that a faster program would not help, and the \ndeformation was increasing with the increase of heating rate. A slower \nheating rate could have solved the problem, but it was operationally \n\nimpracticable.  \n\n\n\n182 \n \n\nTable 26 \u2013 Different thermal debinding programs used on the attempt to \n\ndiminish the deformation of IN718 tubes with 10.0 mm of diameter and 1.0 of \n\nthickness.

Sintered tubes characterization \n\n4.5.3.1. SEM analysis \n\nFigure 112 and Figure 113 show the SEM images of alumina and \n\nIN718 tubes after sintering at 1300 \u00b0C for 60 min. These tubes have 4.5 \nmm of diameter and 1.0 mm of thickness. At this sintering temperature \nand time, some sintering necks were expected on both alumina and \n\nIN718 particles. The necks on the alumina particles are not visible with \nthis magnification, but they were presumably formed, as the resistance \nto fracture of the samples has increased considerably and were not \n\nbreakable by hand. Analytical mechanical resistance tests were not \nperformed due to lack of measurable samples. In the case of the IN718 \n\nsample, the necks are noticeable, though very small. \nSintering at 1300 \u00b0C for 60 minutes was not enough, as would \n\nsuggest the literature (JOHNSON, et al., 2004; CALOW, et al., 1972), \n\nbeing necessary higher sintering temperatures or times to allow neck \ngrowth. It seems that no neck formation occurred between the particles \nand the fibers for both alumina and IN718 powders. Moreover the fibers \n\nmight have refrained the shrinkage of the compact, and consequently \navoided neck growth in both cases. Additionally, the oxidation of the \n\nnickel based powder also restrained sintering. \n\n     \n (a) (b) \nFigure 112 \u2013 SEM images of an alumina tube sintered in forming gas at 1300 \n\u00b0C for 60 min.

Peaks of alpha alumina crystal, originated from \n\nthe alumina powder and Nextel\u2122 fibers, were identified along with \npeaks of (CH2)x, originated from PW and LDPE of the binder. No \nsignificant difference was indentified between the three XRD patterns, \n\nexcepting the peaks of (CH2)x found in the green tube. It may also have \noccurred an increase in crystallinity of the sintered tubes in comparison \n\nwith the green tube, which can be noticed on the slightly narrowing of \nthe peaks on the sintered samples. However this difference can also be \nmere sampling error. No difference at all could be noticed between the \n\ntubes sintered in air and in forming gas. \n\n\n\n185 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 114 \u2013 XRD analyses of green and sintering alumina tubes. Sintering \n\natmospheres: forming gas and air. \n\nFigure 115 shows the XRD results for the green and sintered \nIN718 tubes. On the green sample peaks of alpha alumina crystals, \noriginated from the Nextel fibers, were identified along with peaks of \n\nFeNi alloy, originated from the IN718 powder and related with the two \nmain elements of the alloy. Not surprisingly, on the sintered XRD \npattern two other peaks were identified, chromium nitride (Cr2N) and \n\niron oxide (Fe0.902O). The abundant nitrogen from the forming gas \natmosphere reacted with chromium, which is one of the most important \n\nalloying element (18.5%) of the IN718 nickel superalloy; the reaction \nproduct was stable chromium nitride. On the same way, oxygen \ncontamination in the atmosphere has oxidized iron, the most abundant \n\nalloying element of IN718 (18.9%). The oxygen may have been \nadsorbed on the walls of the furnace. Oxygen may also have entered the \nfurnace during sintering, because the sealing of the furnace was not \n\nefficient, and gaps were sometimes detected. \nThe spinel phase (NiAl2O4), expected to be formed in the alumina \n\nand IN718 interfaces (CALOW, et al., 1971; SURESH, et al., 1993; \nMILEIKO, 1997; MILEIKO, et al., 2002a), has not been detected in the \nXRD analysis. \n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\n2-Theta (\u00b0)\n\nSintered in forming gas\n\nSintered in air\n\nGreen\n\n? - Al2O3\n\ny - (CH2)x\n\n\n\n186 \n \n\n \nFigure 115 \u2013 XRD analysis of green and sintered IN718 tubes. Sintering \n\natmosphere: forming gas. \n\nIn order to investigate the influence of the alumina fibers on the \nsintering of IN718 based tubes, a sample of IN718 without fiber has also \nbeen analyzed by XRD after sintering. The comparative results are \n\nshown in Figure 116. Niobium and Niobium carbide (NbC) peaks have \nbeen identified in the sample without fibers, showing that carburizing \nwas also another effect on the sintering conditions of the present work. \n\nNiobium is another important alloying element of the superalloy (5.0%) \nand reacted with carbon proceeding from the binders. Carburizing was \n\nindeed occurring and the alumina support and the alumina tube of the \nfurnace have been clearly carburized, after every thermal debinding and \nsintering run, showing a typical graphitic color. The carbon on the \n\nalumina support and alumina tube of the furnace is an evidence that the \natmosphere was rich in carbon during thermal debinding, and a higher \ngas flow should be helpful to decrease the atmosphere carbon content \n\n(GERMAN, 1990). Thus the carbon, which formed the carbide found in \nthe XRD analysis, can be originated from the atmosphere that was rich \n\nin carbon after thermal debinding or, eventually, from residual carbon \nthat is likely to happen for low heating rates and in cases where the \nbinders are removed above 450 \u00b0C (GERMAN, 1990). \n\nApart from the different compounds formed, no difference on the \ncharacteristic peaks of the nickel superalloy has been identified.

So far no literature was found \n\nreporting the influence of alumina in nickel superalloys on compound \nformation. \n\n \nFigure 116 \u2013 XRD analysis of sintered IN718 samples with and without \nNextel\u2122 fibers. Sintering atmosphere: forming gas \n\nThe oxides, nitrides and carbides found in the IN718 samples \nexplain the weight gain discussed previously that have disguised the \n\nmass loss during binder extraction. For this reason, the IN718 samples \ndid not reach mass loss equivalent to 100% of binder removal, and \nvalues close to 60% have been measured. \n\nAnother interesting aspect that might be related with the \noxides/nitrides/carbides formation during sintering of the IN718 alloy is \n\na shift of the FeNi peaks, as shown in Figure 117. The three \ncharacteristic peaks have all shifted to higher angles after sintering, \nprobably due to distortions in the crystal lattices with the removal of \n\ncertain amount of iron, chromium and niobium atoms from the alloy, \nwhich were previously in solid solution. The peaks shift should have \nbeen confirmed with the introduction of a small amount of silicon \n\nduring the analysis, which would be used as a reference peak, however \nthis procedure was unknown by the author by the time the samples were \nanalyzed. \n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\n2-Theta (\u00b0)\n\nSintered in forming gas\nwithout fibers\n\nSintered in forming gas\nwith fibers\n\n? - FeNi\n\n? - Fe2N\n\n? - NbC\n\n? - Nb\n\n? - Al2O3\nc - Cr2N\n\ne - Fe0,902O\n\n\n\n188 \n \n\n \nFigure 117 \u2013 XRD analysis of IN718 samples before and after sintering. \n\nSintering atmosphere: forming gas.

Porosimetry analysis \n\nThe porosity of alumina and IN718 sintered tubes were analyzed \nby mercury porosimetry and the results are shown in Figure 118 and \nFigure 119. A considerable amount of mesoporosity has been detected, \n\ni.e. pores between 2 and 50 nm. But in both alumina and IN718 the \nbiggest amount of porous was in the range of macroporosity, i.e. larger \nthan 50 nm. \n\nA higher degree of porosity has been measured in the alumina \n\ntube, 40.57 %, with an average pore diameter of 0.62 ?m. For the IN718 \nsintered tube a total porosity of 36.27 % was measured, with an average \n\npore diameter of 1.98 ?m. The measured average pore diameter and \nlevel of porosity for both alumina and IN718 sintered tubes is adequate \n\nfor some filtering applications, such as hot-gas filtration, for which a \n\npore size ranging from 0.1 to 50 ?m and porosity about 40% are \nrequired (FERNANDO, et al., 2005). However, sintering should be \n\nimproved to allow neck growth between particles and neck formation \n\n0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80\n\nIn\nte\n\nn\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\n2-Theta (\u00b0)\n\nSintered in forming gas\nwithout fibers\n\nGreen\nwithout fibers\n\n? - FeNi\n\n\n\n189 \n\n \n\nbetween particles and fibers, in order to reach sufficient mechanical \n\nstrength. \n\n \nFigure 118 \u2013 Pore size distribution measured by mercury porosimetry of \nalumina sintered tubes. \n\n \nFigure 119 \u2013 Pore size distribution measured by mercury porosimetry of IN718 \n\nsintered tubes \n\n0,00\n\n5,00\n\n10,00\n\n15,00\n\n20,00\n\n25,00\n\n1 10 100 1000 10000 100000\n\nD\nV\n\n/l\no\n\ng\n(D\n\nR\n)\n\nPore Size (nm)\n\nTotal porosity: 40,57 %\n\n0,00\n\n5,00\n\n10,00\n\n15,00\n\n20,00\n\n25,00\n\n1 10 100 1000 10000 100000\n\nD\nV\n\n/l\no\n\ng\n(D\n\nR\n)\n\nPore Size (nm)\n\nTotal porosity: 36,27 %\n\n\n\n190 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n191 \n\n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\nRegarding the preliminary tests: \n\ni. The production of disc-shaped samples via feedstock \nwarm-pressing technique showed to be an easy, fast and \nversatile route for feedstocks development; \n\nii. A binder system composed uniquely of LDPE showed to \nbe inadequate for non-oxide powder processing, for \nwhich a reducing or inert atmosphere must be used \nduring thermal debinding; \n\niii. The use of a LDPE with higher MFI, i.e. higher \nviscosity, does not solve the problems of blisters \n\nformation, edge rounding and deformation, originated \nduring thermal debinding in non-oxidizing atmospheres \nof warm-pressed samples with a binder system consisted \n\nof plain LDPE; \n\nRegarding feedstock development: \n\niv. Deformation and edge rounding could be eliminated by \nincreasing the solids content in the feedstocks; \n\nv. The viscosity model of Frankel and Acrivos showed to \nbe the best model to describe the viscosity as a function \nof solids content for the alumina powder used in the \npresent work; \n\nvi. The elimination of blisters could only be achieved by \nintroducing at least 30 vol.% of PW in the binder system; \n\nvii. The introduction of fibers into the feedstock increased \nconsiderably the torque during mixing of IN718 \nfeedstock, but not for alumina feedstock. This difference \nmight be related with powder composition, particle shape \n\nand particle size distribution; \nviii. Fiber breakage occurred during kneading and was \n\nevident on torque decrease of mixing curves. After \nextrusion, SEM images showed that fiber length has \ndecreased from 30 mm to about 0.5 mm; \n\nix. The fibers did not alter the debinding behavior of the \nwarm-pressed samples; \n\n\n\n192 \n \n\nRegarding powder thermoplastic extrusion: \n\nx. Higher extrusion pressures, which leads to higher \nfeedstock compaction, are achieved with low cylinder \n\ntemperature, low die temperature and high piston speed; \nxi. Cylinder temperature should be kept slightly above the \n\nbackbone melting point. For the feedstock of the present \n\nwork, the temperature of 120 \u00b0C is adequate. Above this \ntemperature rough surface and banana shape defects \nhappen, whereas below this temperature fish scale and \n\nstains appear in the extruded tube. \nxii. Die temperature should be kept below the backbone \n\nmelting point, otherwise the extruded tubes show rough \nsurface and banana shape. In the present work 78 \u00b0C has \nshown to be an adequate temperature; \n\nxiii. Extrusion speed should be kept as low as possible in \norder to avoid defects such as fish scale and banana \nshape. For the present work extrusion speeds equal or \n\nlower than 15.7 mm/min showed to be adequate, no \nmatter the die geometry used; \n\nxiv. Piston speed should be controlled in order to guarantee \nthe same extrusion speed for different die geometries; \n\nxv. Fiber alignment was successfully achieved with the use \nof powder thermoplastic extrusion for the production of \nshort fibers reinforced composites; \n\nRegarding tubes debinding: \n\nxvi. Thermal debinding of tubes showed to be more critical \nthan thermal debinding of warm-pressed discs, and tubes \nwere more prone to undergo deformation; \n\nxvii. Deformation during thermal debinding could be \ndiminished for IN718 tubes and completely avoided for \n\nalumina tubes with the use of a solvent debinding step, \nbefore thermal debinding; \n\nxviii. LDPE showed not to be the ideal binder for alumina and \nIN718 powders, since the onset of sintering temperature \nis considerably higher than the temperature of LDPE \nthermal removal (around 450 \u00b0C). \n\n\n\n193 \n\n \n\nxix. Ethanol showed to be a good solvent for solvent \ndebinding, being able to extract more than 90% of SA \nand PW from the compacts; \n\nRegarding tubes sintering and tubes characterization: \n\nxx. Sintering at 1300 \u00b0C for 60 min is enough for neck \nformation but not enough for neck growth of the used \n\nalumina and IN718 powders. Sintering temperature or \ntime should be increased to develop mechanical strength \nof the tubes; \n\nxxi. XRD analysis of alumina tubes has shown that no \nunexpected phase or crystallinity change has occurred \n\nafter sintering of alumina powder together with alumina \nfibers; \n\nxxii. XRD analysis of IN718 tubes has shown that the \nexpected, but undesired, spinel phase was not formed on \nIN718 particles and alumina fiber interfaces. On the \nother hand, undesired carbides, nitrides and oxides have \n\nbeen formed, reducing the amount of this elements in the \nalloy and, consequently, causing a peak shift on the alloy \n\nXRD pattern. The formation of these compounds has \nshowed that the thermal debinding and sintering \nconditions were not appropriate; \n\nxxiii. Porosimetry analysis have shown that, despite the \nsintering conditions, temperature and time were not \nadequate, the level of porosity and pore size distribution \n\nwas adequate for some filtering applications, such as hot-\ngas filtration. The increase in sintering level of would, \nhowever, decrease the porosity of the material, which \n\ncould make the tubes inadequate for such applications. \n\nAs a final conclusion it can be stated that the powder \n\nthermoplastic extrusion has proved to be a promising processing route to \nproduce short fibers reinforced porous MMCs and CMCs. \n  \n\n\n\n194 \n \n\n  \n\n\n\n195 \n\n \n\nSUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK \n\ni.

Exemplos de processos de \nfiltragem s\u00e3o: purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua, filtra\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00f3leo, filtra\u00e7\u00e3o de \naeross\u00f3is, filtra\u00e7\u00e3o de gases quentes. \n\nNestes processos, os materiais porosos devem apresentar as \nseguintes propriedades: \n\ni. Rede interconectada de poros; \nii. Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho de poros adequada; \n\niii. Resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica; \niv. Resist\u00eancia t\u00e9rmica; \nv. Resist\u00eancia a corros\u00e3o e a oxida\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nContudo, se por um lado estes materiais devem apresentar uma \n\nalta porosidade, por outro lado eles devem ter resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica \nsuficiente para suportar os esfor\u00e7os impostos a estes componentes. \n\nA introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de fibras curtas \u00e9 uma maneira inteligente de \n\naumentar a resist\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica destes componentes sem prejudicar a \nindispens\u00e1vel permeabilidade. \n\nO principal objetivo deste trabalho \u00e9 a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de comp\u00f3sitos \ntubulares porosos de matrizes met\u00e1lica e cer\u00e2mica, refor\u00e7ados por fibras \ncurtas, atrav\u00e9s da extrus\u00e3o termopl\u00e1stica de p\u00f3s. \n\nA extrus\u00e3o termopl\u00e1stica de p\u00f3s \u00e9 um processo capaz de produzir \ntubos de paredes finas, com alta raz\u00e3o de aspecto, isto \u00e9, tubos longos \ncom di\u00e2metro e espessura de parede muito inferiores ao comprimento. \n\nAl\u00e9m disso, a extrus\u00e3o \u00e9 um processo cont\u00ednuo, com capacidade \nprodutiva relativamente alta. No caso da extrus\u00e3o termopl\u00e1stica, uma \ndas vantagens \u00e9 a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do tamanho de fibras, pois este processo \n\nimp\u00f5e esfor\u00e7os cisalhantes muito inferiores se comparados com a \nextrus\u00e3o convencional. Outra caracter\u00edstica do processo em quest\u00e3o \u00e9 o \n\nalinhamento das fibras na dire\u00e7\u00e3o da extrus\u00e3o. \nAl\u00e9m do objetivo principal, s\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m objetivos deste trabalho: \n\ni. Desenvolver um feedstock adequado aos processos de \nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de ligantes e extrus\u00e3o; \n\n\n\n206 \n \n\nii. Investigar a influ\u00eancia das fibras durante os processos de \nmistura e remo\u00e7\u00e3o dos ligantes; \n\niii. Investigar a influ\u00eancia dos par\u00e2metros de extrus\u00e3o, \nnotadamente, temperatura do cilindro, temperatura da \nmatriz de extrus\u00e3o e velocidade do pist\u00e3o; \n\niv. Caracterizar os tubos sinterizados em termos de \nmicroestrutura, porosidade e fases cristalinas. \n\nBreve descri\u00e7\u00e3o experimental \n\nPara compor a matriz dos comp\u00f3sitos de matriz met\u00e1lica foi \n\nescolhido p\u00f3 de superliga de n\u00edquel IN718, com tamanho m\u00e9dio de \n\npart\u00edcula de 6,5 ?m em formato esf\u00e9rico. No caso dos comp\u00f3sitos de \n\nmatriz cer\u00e2mica foi escolhido p\u00f3 de ?-alumina, com tamanho m\u00e9dio de \n\npart\u00edcula de 2,5 ?m em formato poligonal. \nComo refor\u00e7o foram selecionadas fibras comerciais de alumina \n\nNextel\u2122 610, fornecidas pela 3M Company. As fibras foram fornecidas \n\npicadas no comprimento de 30 mm, com di\u00e2metro entre 10 e 12 ?m. \nComo ligantes foram utilizados dois polietilenos de baixa \n\ndensidade, um com \u00edndice de fluidez de 2,0 g/10min (LDPE02) e outro \ncom \u00edndice de fluidez de 70,0 g/10min (LDPE70), parafina (PW) e \u00e1cido \neste\u00e1rico (SA). \n\nO desenvolvimento do feedstock foi dividido em duas etapas. \nA primeira consistiu em definir o teor de s\u00f3lidos. Para isto foi \n\nutilizado somente polietileno (LDPE02 e LDPE70) e alumina, por ser o \n\np\u00f3 que rendia feedstocks de maior viscosidade. O teor de s\u00f3lidos variou \nentre 54 e 62 % em volume. \n\nA segunda etapa consistiu em definir o teor de parafina no \nsistema ligante. Para isso foram utilizados como ligantes LDPE, PW e \nSA e, desta vez, feedstocks dos dois tipos de p\u00f3s (alumina e IN718) \n\nforam produzidos. O teor de LDPE, bem como o de PW, variou entre 0 \ne 95 % em volume. O teor de SA foi fixado em 5 % em volume. Nesta \netapa foi utilizado o teor de s\u00f3lidos definido na etapa anterior. \n\nO procedimento utilizado em ambas as etapas do \ndesenvolvimento do feedstock consistiu em misturar os p\u00f3s com os \nligantes em um kneader (re\u00f4metro de torque) a 180 \u00b0C por 30 minutos e, \n\nem seguida a 152 \u00b0C por 40 minutos. Nesta etapa, o valor do torque \nnecess\u00e1rio para a mistura foi importante na avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do teor de s\u00f3lidos, \n\nbem como do teor de PW. Em seguida o feedstock produzido foi \ngranulado em um re\u00f4metro capilar atrav\u00e9s de uma matriz de 1 mm de \n\n\n\n207 \n\n \n\ndi\u00e2metro a 140 \u00b0C. Ap\u00f3s isso, os gr\u00e2nulos foram prensados a morno (a \n\ntemperaturas em torno da temperatura de fus\u00e3o dos polietilenos) em \nforma de disco, atrav\u00e9s de uma prensa manual, sob for\u00e7a de 10 kN. A \n\nmatriz utilizada apresentava 28 mm de di\u00e2metro. A quantidade de \ngr\u00e2nulos prensada foi suficiente para produzir discos com espessura de \n0.8 mm. Os discos prensados foram ent\u00e3o levados ao forno para a \n\nremo\u00e7\u00e3o dos ligantes, que se deu \u00e0 600 \u00b0C por 60 minutos, com uma \ntaxa de aquecimento de 0,5 \u00b0C/min, em atmosferas redutora (no caso \ndos comp\u00f3sitos de matrizes met\u00e1lica e cer\u00e2mica) e oxidante (somente no \n\ncaso de comp\u00f3sitos de matriz cer\u00e2mica). Em seguida, os discos foram \navaliados no tocante \u00e0 de presen\u00e7a de bolhas e deforma\u00e7\u00e3o, para \n\ndefini\u00e7\u00e3o do teor de s\u00f3lidos e teor de parafina. \nPara a extrus\u00e3o de tubos, as fibras de alumina foram incorporadas \n\nao feedstock no teor de 30 % em volume. Tubos as seguintes geometrias \n\nforam extrudados: \n\ni. 10,0 mm de di\u00e2metro e 1,0 mm de espessura; \nii. 10,0 mm de di\u00e2metro e 0.6 mm de espessura; \n\niii. 4,5 mm de di\u00e2metro e 1,0 mm de espessura. \n\nOs par\u00e2metros de extrus\u00e3o, isto \u00e9, temperatura do cilindro, \n\ntemperatura da matriz de extrus\u00e3o e velocidade do pist\u00e3o, foram \ncontrolados a fim de se obter extrudados visualmente sem defeitos. \n\nOs ligantes foram removidos por meio de extra\u00e7\u00e3o por solvente e \n\nextra\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica. A extra\u00e7\u00e3o por solventes se deu a 60 \u00b0C em um banho \nde etanol 95 % durante 5 horas. A extra\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica se deu a 600 \u00b0C \ndurante 60 minutos, com uma taxa de aquecimento de 0,5 \u00b0C/min, em \n\natmosferas redutora e oxidante. \nFinalmente os tubos foram sinterizados a 1300 \u00b0C durante 60 \n\nminutos, a uma taxa de aquecimento de 5,0 \u00b0C/min, tamb\u00e9m em \n\natmosferas redutora e oxidante. \nOs tubos foram ent\u00e3o caracterizados por microscopia eletr\u00f4nica \n\nde varredura, difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raio-X e porosimetria. \n\nPrincipais resultados \n\nDurante os testes preliminares os discos de alumina apresentaram \n\ndefeitos ap\u00f3s a extra\u00e7\u00e3o do LDPE70, realizadas em atmosfera redutora. \nOs defeitos encontrados foram bolhas, arredondamentos das arestas e \ndeforma\u00e7\u00e3o. Nenhum defeito foi encontrado nos discos de alumina ap\u00f3s \n\n\n\n208 \n \n\na remo\u00e7\u00e3o dos ligantes em atmosfera oxidante. No caso dos discos de \n\nIN718, os mesmos defeitos surgiram ap\u00f3s a remo\u00e7\u00e3o dos ligantes em \natmosfera redutora. N\u00e3o foram realizados testes de extra\u00e7\u00e3o em \n\natmosfera oxidante para este p\u00f3, devido a potencial oxida\u00e7\u00e3o da matriz \nmet\u00e1lica. \n\nN\u00e3o foram obtidos resultados melhores com LDPE02, e este \n\npolietileno n\u00e3o foi posteriormente utilizado, pois a viscosidade dos \nfeedstocks com este ligante era muito elevada. \n\nAtrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise do torque durante a mistura dos feedstocks de \n\nalumina, com diferentes teores de s\u00f3lidos, foi poss\u00edvel calcular o teor \nm\u00e1ximo de s\u00f3lidos admiss\u00edvel para este sistema, no valor de 71,4 % em \n\nvolume. Com base nos resultados de extra\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica dos mesmos \nfeedstocks, o teor de s\u00f3lidos ficou definido em 62 % em volume. \n\nOs valores de torque medidos durante esta etapa foram \n\ncomparados a diversos modelos de viscosidade, sendo que o modelo de \nFrankel e Acrivos foi o que melhor descreveu o comportamento do \nfeedstock em quest\u00e3o. \n\nA quantidade de bolhas nas amostras, ap\u00f3s a extra\u00e7\u00e3o dos \nligantes, foi o par\u00e2metro utilizado como crit\u00e9rio para a defini\u00e7\u00e3o do teor \n\nde parafina. Sendo assim o teor de parafina m\u00ednimo necess\u00e1rio para \nevitar a forma\u00e7\u00e3o deste defeito foi de 30 % em volume. \n\nPor fim, o feedstock final para a extrus\u00e3o foi definido, sendo \n\nconstitu\u00eddo da seguinte forma: \n\ni. 62 % em volume de s\u00f3lidos, dos quais: \na. 70 % em volume composto de p\u00f3s; \nb. 30 % em volume composto de fibras; \n\nii. 38 % em volume de ligantes, dos quais: \na. 5 % em volume de SA; \nb. 30 % em volume de PW; \nc. 65 % em volume de LDPE70. \n\nDurante a extrus\u00e3o, a press\u00e3o interna do cilindro variou com a \ntemperatura do cilindro seguindo a rela\u00e7\u00e3o da equa\u00e7\u00e3o de Arrhenius. \nTubos extrudados com cilindro acima da temperatura de fus\u00e3o do \n\nLDPE70 apresentaram empenamento e superf\u00edcie rugosa. Os tubos \nextrudados abaixo da temperatura de fus\u00e3o ficaram retos, contudo outros \ndois defeitos superficiais ficaram evidentes, como escama de peixe e \n\nmanchamento. \n\n\n\n209 \n\n \n\nA temperatura da matriz de extrus\u00e3o foi controlada atrav\u00e9s do \n\ncontato com fluido refrigerante. Os fluidos refrigerantes utilizados \nforam etanol e \u00e1gua. Os melhores resultados foram obtidos atrav\u00e9s do \n\nresfriamento da matriz com etanol e alguns tubos sem defeitos foram \nobtidos desta forma. \n\nFinalmente, o \u00faltimo par\u00e2metro de extrus\u00e3o controlado foi a \n\nvelocidade do pist\u00e3o. Foi observado que a velocidade do pist\u00e3o n\u00e3o era \no fator mais relevante, e sim, a velocidade de extrus\u00e3o, \u00e0 qual est\u00e1 \ndiretamente relacionada a velocidade do pist\u00e3o. Diversos testes foram \n\nfeitos a diferentes velocidades e, finalmente, a velocidade de extrus\u00e3o \n\u00f3tima foi definida como sendo 15,7 mm/min. \n\nEnfim os par\u00e2metros de extrus\u00e3o foram definidos da seguinte \nforma: \n\ni. Temperatura do cilindro: 120 \u00b0C; \nii. Temperatura da matriz de extrus\u00e3o: 120 \u00b0C na entrada e \n\n78 \u00b0C na sa\u00edda; \niii. Velocidade de extrus\u00e3o: 15,7 mm/min. \n\nSob as condi\u00e7\u00f5es acima descritas, os tubos produzidos n\u00e3o \napresentavam qualquer tipo de defeito visual. Diversos tubos com \n\ncomprimento de aproximadamente 15 cm foram extrudados nas tr\u00eas \ndiferentes geometrias. \n\nEm seguida, foi realizada a extra\u00e7\u00e3o dos ligantes dos tubos. A \n\ntentativa inicial de remover os ligantes atrav\u00e9s de extra\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica foi \nineficaz e os tubos colapsaram, perdendo, em alguns casos, totalmente a \nforma cil\u00edndrica. Com base neste resultado decidiu-se por utilizar, \n\npreviamente \u00e0 extra\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica, a extra\u00e7\u00e3o por solvente. \nA an\u00e1lise das amostras atrav\u00e9s de microscopia eletr\u00f4nica, antes e \n\ndepois da extra\u00e7\u00e3o por solvente, mostrou que uma rede de poros surgiu \n\nnas amostras ap\u00f3s a extra\u00e7\u00e3o por solvente. A obten\u00e7\u00e3o desta rede de \nporos tem por finalidade facilitar a permea\u00e7\u00e3o dos gases produzidos \n\ndurante a posterior remo\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica dos ligantes. \nOs resultados ap\u00f3s a extra\u00e7\u00e3o por solvente seguida por extra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nt\u00e9rmica foram satisfat\u00f3rios e a maioria dos tubos n\u00e3o apresentou \n\ndeforma\u00e7\u00e3o. \nFinalmente, os tubos foram sinterizados a 1300 \u00b0C durante 60 \n\nminutos. \n\nAs imagens obtidas por microscopia eletr\u00f4nica de varredura \nmostraram uma estrutura bastante porosa, na qual as part\u00edculas \n\n\n\n210 \n \n\npraticamente n\u00e3o sinterizaram e o crescimento dos pesco\u00e7os de \n\nsinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o n\u00e3o foi observado. \nA forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos pesco\u00e7os pode ser somente observada entre as \n\npart\u00edculas de IN718. As fibras, por sua vez, aparentemente n\u00e3o aderiram \na nenhuma das part\u00edculas, tanto nos comp\u00f3sitos de matriz de IN718 \nquanto nos de matriz de alumina. \n\nOs resultados de difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X mostraram que nenhuma \n\nfase diferente de ?-alumina formou-se nos comp\u00f3sitos de matriz \ncer\u00e2mica. J\u00e1 nos comp\u00f3sitos de matriz met\u00e1lica, picos de nitretos, \n\ncarbonetos e \u00f3xidos foram identificados. Com base nestes resultados, \npode-se dizer que a atmosfera redutora, rica em nitrog\u00eanio, interagiu \n\ncom as amostras formando nitretos. O carbono, oriundo dos ligantes, \nque n\u00e3o foi totalmente extra\u00eddo na forma de gases, tamb\u00e9m interagiu \ncom as part\u00edculas met\u00e1licas, formando os carbonetos. A oxida\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\namostras, por sua vez, mostrou que a veda\u00e7\u00e3o do forno n\u00e3o foi \nsatisfat\u00f3ria, e uma quantidade significativa de oxig\u00eanio estava presente \nna atmosfera durante o tratamento t\u00e9rmico. \n\nOutro aspecto interessante observado na difratometria dos \ncomp\u00f3sitos de matriz met\u00e1lica foi o deslocamento dos picos \ncaracter\u00edsticos da liga de n\u00edquel. Este deslocamento se deve, \n\nprovavelmente, a distor\u00e7\u00f5es na rede cristalina causada pelo \nempobrecimento da liga em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos elementos formadores de \n\ncarbonetos, nitretos e \u00f3xidos. \nFinalmente, a an\u00e1lise porosim\u00e9trica das amostras mostrou que os \n\ntubos em matriz cer\u00e2mica apresentaram uma porosidade de 40,57 %, \n\ncom um tamanho m\u00e9dio de poros de 0,62 ?m. Os tubos em matriz \nmet\u00e1lica apresentaram uma porosidade de 36,27, com um tamanho \n\nm\u00e9dio de poros de 1,98 ?m. A partir desses resultados pode-se dizer que \n\nos comp\u00f3sitos tubulares porosos de matriz met\u00e1lica e cer\u00e2mica, \nrefor\u00e7ados por fibras curtas, obtidos atrav\u00e9s da extrus\u00e3o termopl\u00e1stica \nde p\u00f3s, s\u00e3o adequados \u00e0 aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de filtragem de gases quentes, a qual \n\nrequer uma porosidade em torno de 40 %, com uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\ntamanho de poros entre 0,1 e 50 ?m. \n\nConclus\u00f5es mais relevantes \n\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao desenvolvimento dos feedstocks: \n\n\n\n211 \n\n \n\ni. Deforma\u00e7\u00e3o e arredondamento de arestas, ap\u00f3s remo\u00e7\u00e3o \ndos ligantes dos discos prensados, puderam ser \neliminados com o aumento do teor de s\u00f3lidos; \n\nii. A elimina\u00e7\u00e3o de bolhas pode ser alcan\u00e7ada somente com \na introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de, no m\u00ednimo, 30 % em volume de PW;  \n\niii. A quebra das fibras foi satisfatoriamente alcan\u00e7ada \ndurante a prepara\u00e7\u00e3o da mistura. \n\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 extrus\u00e3o termopl\u00e1stica de p\u00f3s: \n\niv. Altas press\u00f5es de extrus\u00e3o, que trazem como \nconsequ\u00eancia uma mais efetiva compacta\u00e7\u00e3o do \nfeedstock, s\u00e3o obtidas atrav\u00e9s de uma baixa temperatura \n\ndo cilindro, baixa temperatura da matriz de extrus\u00e3o e \nalta velocidade de extrus\u00e3o; \n\nv. A temperatura do cilindro deve ser mantida ligeiramente \nacima da temperatura de fus\u00e3o do backbone. Para o \nfeedstock deste trabalho, 120 \u00b0C \u00e9 uma temperatura \nadequada. Acima desta temperatura, superf\u00edcie rugosa e \n\nempenamento dos tubos tornam-se evidentes, ao passo \nque, abaixo desta temperatura, escamas de peixes e \n\nmanchas surgem na superf\u00edcie dos tubos; \nvi. A temperatura da matriz de extrus\u00e3o deve ser mantida \n\nabaixo da temperatura de fus\u00e3o do backbone, caso \n\ncontr\u00e1rio, surgem defeitos como empenamento e \nrugosidade na superf\u00edcie dos tubos. Para o presente \ntrabalho, 78 \u00b0C foi a temperatura adequada para a matriz \n\nde extrus\u00e3o; \nvii. A velocidade de extrus\u00e3o deve ser mantida a mais baixa \n\nposs\u00edvel, para evitar defeitos como escama de peixe e \n\nempenamento. Para o feedstock desenvolvido, a \nvelocidade m\u00e1xima que permitia a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nextrudados livres de defeitos foi de 15,7 mm/min; \nviii. A extrus\u00e3o termopl\u00e1stica promoveu o alinhamento das \n\nfibras. \n\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 remo\u00e7\u00e3o de ligantes dos tubos: \n\n\n\n212 \n \n\nix. A deforma\u00e7\u00e3o dos tubos foi evitada com a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de \nremo\u00e7\u00e3o de ligantes por solventes; \n\nx. Etanol \u00e9 um bom solvente para extra\u00e7\u00e3o de PW e SA; \n\nEm rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos tubos sinterizados: \n\nxi. Sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o a 1300 \u00b0C durante 60 minutos n\u00e3o \u00e9 \nsuficiente para promover o crescimento dos pesco\u00e7os de \n\nsinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o entre as part\u00edculas e entre as fibras e \npart\u00edculas; \n\nxii. A an\u00e1lise difratom\u00e9trica mostrou que nenhuma fase, \n\nal\u00e9m de ?-alumina, formou-se durante a sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos \ncomp\u00f3sitos de matriz cer\u00e2mica; \n\nxiii. Nitretos, carbonetos e \u00f3xidos foram encontrados nos \ncomp\u00f3sitos de matriz met\u00e1lica, indicando que a \natmosfera utilizada n\u00e3o foi a mais adequada para a \n\nsinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o destes comp\u00f3sitos; \nxiv. Porosimetria mostrou que os tubos produzidos \n\napresentam porosidade e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de tamanho de \n\nporos adequada para a filtra\u00e7\u00e3o de gases quentes. \n\nFinalmente, a extrus\u00e3o termopl\u00e1stica de p\u00f3s provou ser um \nprocesso promissor para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de comp\u00f3sitos tubulares porosos em \n\nmatriz cer\u00e2mica e met\u00e1lica refor\u00e7ados por fibras curtas."}]}}}
