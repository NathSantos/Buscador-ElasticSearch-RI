As interac\u00e7\u00f5es tinta-papel s\u00e3o afectadas quer pelas propriedades f\u00edsico-\n\nqu\u00edmicas da superf\u00edcie do papel quer pelas propriedades da matriz fibrosa, pelo que n\u00e3o \n\napenas o tratamento final da superf\u00edcie mas, em geral, todas as opera\u00e7\u00f5es do processo de \n\nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o condicionam o desempenho do papel em termos de impress\u00e3o. Neste contexto, a \n\nmodifica\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica da superf\u00edcie do papel \u00e9 hoje em dia uma pr\u00e1tica comum para \n\naumentar a qualidade de impress\u00e3o, sendo a colagem superficial uma opera\u00e7\u00e3o corrente \n\nem qualquer f\u00e1brica de papel.  \n\nTradicionalmente, \u00e9 utilizada uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de amido para o tratamento superficial de \n\npap\u00e9is de impress\u00e3o e escrita, a fim de melhorar propriedades como a resist\u00eancia \n\nsuperficial ou imprimabilidade. No entanto, recentemente t\u00eam vindo a ser usadas \n\nformula\u00e7\u00f5es de colagem superficial \u00e0 base de misturas de amido cati\u00f3nico com pequenas \n\npercentagens de copol\u00edmeros sint\u00e9ticos, de modo a real\u00e7ar os efeitos da colagem \n\nsuperficial, particularmente no que diz respeito \u00e0 energia de superf\u00edcie, car\u00e1cter hidrof\u00edlico \n\ne afinidade para com diferentes tipos de tinta. O objectivo principal \u00e9 o de optimizar os \n\nprocessos de absor\u00e7\u00e3o e espalhamento das tintas de impress\u00e3o, e assim favorecer a \n\nqualidade de impress\u00e3o. \n\nO principal objectivo do presente trabalho \u00e9 precisamente analisar o impacto da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde diferentes formula\u00e7\u00f5es de colagem superficial, constitu\u00eddas por misturas de amido e um \n\nagente de colagem, tanto nas propriedades superficiais do papel como na qualidade de \n\nimpress\u00e3o. Para tal foram utilizadas misturas de amido cati\u00f3nico com 10 copol\u00edmeros \n\ndistintos, em tr\u00eas percentagens diferentes de copol\u00edmero (5%, 10% e 20% w/w), num total \n\nde 30 formula\u00e7\u00f5es. Estas formula\u00e7\u00f5es foram devidamente caracterizadas e depois \n\naplicadas na superf\u00edcie de folhas de papel n\u00e3o revestido produzido com base em pasta \n\nkraft branqueada de E. globulus e procedeu-se \u00e0 an\u00e1lise exaustiva das respectivas \n\nsuperf\u00edcies, designadamente em termos de lisura, porosidade e algumas propriedades \n\nqu\u00edmicas, como a energia de superf\u00edcie e o car\u00e1cter \u00e1cido-base da superf\u00edcie. O papel \n\ntratado com 100% de amido cati\u00f3nico foi tomado como amostra de refer\u00eancia. Foram \n\nutilizadas diversas t\u00e9cnicas de caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o, como perfilometria \u00f3ptica, porosimetria de \n\nmerc\u00fario, medi\u00e7\u00e3o dos \u00e2ngulos de contacto e cromatografia gasosa de fase inversa (IGC). \n\n\n\n \n\n x \n\nComplementarmente, usou-se ainda Microscopia de For\u00e7a At\u00f3mica, Espectroscopia \n\nElectr\u00f3nica para An\u00e1lise Qu\u00edmica e Espectroscopia de I\u00e3o Secund\u00e1rio, a fim de esclarecer \n\naspectos mais espec\u00edficos em algumas das amostras. Por fim, procedeu-se \u00e0 avalia\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nqualidade de impress\u00e3o inkjet nas diferentes amostras, atrav\u00e9s quer da determina\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nv\u00e1rios par\u00e2metros de qualidade de impress\u00e3o quer da an\u00e1lise das amostras impressas por \n\num painel de utilizadores finais deste tipo de pap\u00e9is. Estes resultados foram correlacionados \n\ncom os provenientes da caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o da superf\u00edcie do papel, recorrendo a PLS (Partial \n\nLeast Squares). Todos os resultados experimentais foram sujeitos a uma an\u00e1lise de vari\u00e2ncia \n\n(ANOVA) e an\u00e1lise de componentes principais (PCA - Principal Component Analysis) por \n\nforma a avaliar a variabilidade intra e inter-amostras. Esta variabilidade foi analisada de \n\nmodo sistem\u00e1tico tendo em conta os tratamentos de superf\u00edcie aplicados. \n\nO estudo desenvolvido revelou que os tratamentos de colagem na superf\u00edcie do papel t\u00eam \n\num impacto pouco significativo em par\u00e2metros f\u00edsicos, como os determinados por \n\nperfilometria ou por porosimetria de merc\u00fario, mas influenciam decisivamente as \n\npropriedades qu\u00edmicas da superf\u00edcie das amostras. Com efeito, as diferentes formula\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ntestadas conduziram a n\u00edveis de energia de superf\u00edcie e de car\u00e1cter \u00e1cido-base, avaliados \n\npela medi\u00e7\u00e3o dos \u00e2ngulos de contacto e por IGC, significativamente diferentes. Estas \n\ndiferen\u00e7as permitiram detectar e interpretar os efeitos quer da natureza quer da \n\nquantidade de copol\u00edmero incorporado nas formula\u00e7\u00f5es, conduzindo ainda a uma melhor \n\ncompreens\u00e3o das interac\u00e7\u00f5es de natureza f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmica que ocorrem \u00e0 superf\u00edcie do papel \n\nquando este \u00e9 sujeito a tratamentos de colagem superficial para optimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do processo \n\nde impress\u00e3o inkjet. \n\nPor \u00faltimo, \u00e9 de sublinhar que os resultados obtidos neste trabalho se revestem do maior \n\ninteresse para a ind\u00fastria papeleira nacional, na medida em envolvem o seu mais \n\nimportante produto \u2013 os pap\u00e9is n\u00e3o revestidos para impress\u00e3o e escrita \u2013, para o qual n\u00e3o \n\nh\u00e1 estudos sistem\u00e1ticos publicados com as formula\u00e7\u00f5es testadas. Al\u00e9m disso, a selec\u00e7\u00e3o das \n\nformula\u00e7\u00f5es e dos copol\u00edmeros teve em conta a viabilidade da sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o industrial. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nxi \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThe consumer\u2019s demand for quality in printing and writing paper grades (P&amp;W) is increasing, \n\nespecially in what concerns printability. \n\nPaper-ink interactions are strongly dependent on the structural and chemical properties of \n\nthe paper surface. These properties are the result not only of specific surface treatments but \n\nalso of the properties of the fibrous matrix, namely the quality of the pulp fibers. Therefore \n\nfinal printing quality performance of the paper is influenced, in general, by all the \n\noperations in the papermaking process. For this reason the chemical modification of the \n\npaper surface in order to improve printing quality is nowadays a common practice in \n\npapermaking, and surface sizing is a standard operation in many paper mills. \n\nTypically \u2013 and especially for P&amp;W papers - starch is used for surface sizing, with the main \n\ngoal of improving paper surface resistance and printability. However, there is an increasing \n\ntendency to use blends of cationic starch and synthetic copolymers to enhance surface sizing \n\neffects by controlling the paper surface energy, the corresponding hydrophilic character and \n\nthe affinity towards different types of ink. The main objective of this approach is to improve \n\nprint quality by optimizing the balance between the absorption and spreading phenomena.  \n\nThis work targets the analysis of the impact of the application of different surface sizing \n\nformulations, composed of blends of cationic starch and minor quantities of distinct \n\ncopolymers, in the chemical and physical surface characteristics of the modified paper \n\nsamples and in the final printing quality. Ten distinct copolymers were blended with cationic \n\nstarch in three different percentages of copolymer (5%, 10% and 20% w/w), resulting in a \n\ntotal of 30 different formulations. These formulations were characterized and applied to the \n\nsurface of an E. globulus bleached kraft pulp based uncoated paper, and the corresponding \n\npaper surfaces were fully characterized with respect to some structural properties, namely \n\nroughness and porosity, as well as some chemical properties, namely surface energy and \n\nacid-base character. A sample surface sized only with cationic starch was taken as \n\nreference. Several characterization techniques were used, namely laser profilometry, \n\nmercury porosimetry, contact angle measurements and inverse gas chromatography (IGC). \n\nSelected samples were additionally analyzed by Atomic Force Microscopy, Electron \n\nSpectroscopy for Chemical Analysis and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy, in \n\norder to clarify specific aspects. Finally, the influence of the different sizing agents on the \n\nprinting quality of the samples was investigated by quantifying several parameters in a \n\n\n\n \n\n xii \n\nspecific inkjet printed mask and also by using the results of an evaluating panel composed of \n\nseveral end users of this type of papers. \n\nThe results from the printing tests were correlated to those obtained from the \n\ncharacterization of the paper surfaces by using Partial Least Squares. All the data were \n\nsubmitted to an analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in \n\norder to evaluate inter and intra-samples variability.  This variability was thoroughly \n\nanalyzed and interpreted in terms of the corresponding surface treatments. \n\nThe results revealed that the surface sizing treatments used in this study have a minor impact \n\non the surface roughness and porosity, but a substantial influence on surface energetics. In \n\nfact, relevant differences were detected in the surface energy and acid-base character of \n\nthe sized samples, as measured by contact angle and IGC.  These differences enabled the \n\ninterpretation of the influence of the nature and quantity of the copolymers used in the sizing \n\nformulations and simultaneously a better understanding of the physical and chemical \n\ninteractions that occur at paper surface when it is subjected to a sizing treatment in order to \n\noptimize the inkjet printing process. \n\nFinally, it should be pointed out that the results are of the utmost importance to the national \n\npaper industry as they relate to its most relevant product \u2013 the eucalyptus based printing \n\nand writing uncoated papers \u2013 for which there are no published results involving the tested \n\nformulations. Furthermore, both the copolymers and the formulations used were selected \n\nhaving in mind the feasibility of their application in the paper industry. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

T. Moutinho 3 \n\n1 INTRODUCTION \n\nPaper has played a vital role in the cultural development of mankind, being used mainly for \n\nwriting, printing, and packaging. It plays a key role in communication; printed communication \n\nis almost synonymous with paper. Papermaking is a vast, multidisciplinary technology that has \n\nexpanded tremendously in recent years. Significant advances have been made in all areas \n\nof papermaking, including raw materials, production technology, process control and end \n\nproducts. The complexity of the processes, the scale of operation, and production speeds \n\nleave little room for error or malfunction. Modern papermaking would not be possible \n\nwithout a proper command of a great variety of technologies. Along the years not only has \n\nthe technology progressed and new technology emerged, but also the understanding of the \n\nfundamentals of unit processes, raw materials and product properties have also deepened \n\nconsiderably. Paper products are complex in structure and contain many different \n\ncomponents. The requirements placed on the way these products perform are wide, varied \n\nand often conflicting. Product development and improvements is thus a constant need and \n\nrequires a profound understanding of the chemistry and physics of both raw materials and \n\nproduct structures (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Levlin and S\u00f6derhjelm \n\n2000) \n\n \n\n1.1 HISTORY \n\nFollowing the evolution of the human intelligence, the graphical representations became \n\nincreasingly complex, and together with an increase in the ability to create tools, took to the \n\ndevelopment of more adequate supports. The history tells about the use of boards, cooked \n\nclay, tissues of various fibers, papyrus, parchment and finally paper (Oittinen and Saarelma \n\n1998; Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000). \n\nClay seems to have been the first material used explicitly for writing, by Sumerians, 6 \n\nmillennia B.C.. The manuscripts on dry palm leaves appeared after the invention of the \n\nalphabet, and they were used mainly in India and Southeast Asia until the 19th century. In \n\nGreece appeared the waxed boards, which the Romans have also adopted. About 3 \n\nthousand years B.C. it was found out the possibility of the adaptation for writing of thick stem \n\nplants, which grew in the margins of the Nile River and were called \u201cPapyrus\u201d. Many years \n\nafter, the Romans improved the papyrus quality, by pasting the fibers to each other with \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M. T. Moutinho 4 \n\nstarch glues. Papyrus was in fact the main mean for writing communication until the 8th \n\ncentury. (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000). \n\nThe primacy of paper production is assigned to Ts'ai Lun of china in the year 105 After \n\nChrist, who made paper of fishing nets and rags pulp, and later using vegetable fibers. In \n\nEurope, paper was first manufactured in Spain and Sicily, and gradually its use spread \n\nnorthward (Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  \n\nWhen the paper demand rapidly increased in the eighteenth century, papermakers in \n\nContinental Europe came up with the idea of developing a machine for forming the paper.  \n\nNicolas-Louis Robert (1761-1828) has gone down in history as the inventor of a continuously \n\nmoving belt of wire cloth on which the fiber suspension was spread and the water was \n\nallowed to drain away, leaving an endless sheet of paper on the wire. The first trials were \n\nmade as early as 1793, but only in 1798 a construction on which a continuous web of paper \n\ncould be made. The wooden machine was 260 cm long, and the width of the paper was 64 \n\ncentimeters (Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  \n\nIn 1807, a patent for a machine with the essential features of the \"fourdrinier\" machine we \n\nknow today was procured in the names of the Fourdrinier brothers (Henry and Sealy) and \n\nJohn Gamble (Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  \n\nIn the 1820s in England, machine-produced paper surpassed in quantity the hand-paper \n\nproduction. Around 1840, there were about 250 paper machines in operation in England, \n\n125 in France, and 50 in Germany, the majority of which were of English origin (Lehtinen \n\n2000; Paulapuro 2000). \n\nAlong the years many individuals and companies obtained patents on the basic components \n\nin the process. Improvements at each stage of the papermaking process have contributed to \n\nthe exceptional speed, runnability, and reliability of today's paper machines. Figure 1.1 shows \n\nthe exponential increase in maximum operating speeds of paper machines (Lehtinen 2000; \n\nPaulapuro 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

T. Moutinho 6 \n\n1.2 PAPER PRODUCTION \n\nPaper is obtained by a mixture of fibers, typically from vegetal origin composed by \n\ncellulose, which are kept together by hydrogen bridges. The most common source of natural \n\nfibers is the pulp obtained from the wood of threes. Vegetal fibers such as cotton, hemp, flax \n\nand rice can also be used. Usually, and regarding printing and writing (P&amp;W) papers in \n\nparticular, composition also includes filler and additives (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; \n\nLehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  \n\nThe papermaking process contains a great number of different unit processes, which work \n\nthrough different mechanisms to produce the desired effects on the fiber suspension, and \n\nsubsequently, on the fibrous web. It starts with slushing of fibers and other raw materials in \n\nwater, continues through paper machine and finishing operations and ends with packaging of \n\nthe paper. The papermaking process is essentially a very large drainage operation. Figure \n\n7.12 presents the main sections of a paper mill, which comprise the stock preparation, paper \n\nmachine and finishing and the typical layout of a P&amp;W paper machine. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Schematic representation of the production process for printing and writing papers. \n\n \n\nConsistency of the stock flow entering the paper machine forming section is typically between \n\n0.2% and 1.0% (2 - 10 g fiber per kg water). After drainage on the wire of the forming \n\nsection using gravitation, pulsation, or vacuum, the web consistency increases to 15% - 25%. \n\nMechanical compression removes water on the press section. The web consistency (now called \n\ndry solids content) then increases to 33% - 55% depending on the paper grade and press \n\nsection design. After the press section, the web enters the pre-dryer section where \n\nevaporation, removes the remaining water. However, a small amount of moisture (2% - 5%) \n\nFinishing Paper Machine \nStock \n\nPreparation \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 7 \n\nremains in the paper before the surface sizing operation, after which the paper web enters \n\nin the after-drying section, to achieve the final moisture content typically between 5% and \n\n7% (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro 2000).  \n\n \n\nAlthough the principles of paper manufacturing are similar to the ones developed many \n\ncenturies ago, significant advances have been made in all areas of papermaking, including \n\nraw materials, production technology, process control and end products. As mentioned in the \n\nvery beginning of this work, at the present time, the complexity of the processes, the scale of \n\noperation, and the production speeds leave little room for error or malfunction. Paper must \n\nmaintain its competitiveness through continuous product development in order to meet the \n\never-increasing demands on its performance. This framework is the main driving force for \n\nmany studies on paper, with a great focus on paper surface in the most recent years, mainly \n\ndue to the increasing importance given to paper ink interactions, which are mainly ruled by \n\nthe paper surface properties (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Paulapuro \n\n2000). \n\n \n\n1.3 PAPER SURFACE TREATMENTS \n\nCurrently, paper surface has been the subject of many attentions, since it is one of the crucial \n\nfactors affecting the final performance of the paper. Paper surface treatments are thus \n\nincreasingly used in every paper mill to control and improve the surface properties of its \n\nproduct. These surface treatments may be physical (calendering) or chemical (surface sizing \n\nor coating) (Keskitalo 2000; Levlin and S\u00f6derhjelm 2000).  \n\nIn the production of P&amp;W papers, the physical treatment of the surface by calendering and \n\nthe chemical treatment by surface sizing are generally always used. Coating is a chemical \n\nsurface treatment rarely applied for this type of papers; it is currently used for many other \n\npaper grades such as magazine paper of photographic paper (Lehtinen 2000). \n\nCalendering consists in submitting the paper to pressure, by passing it between rolling \n\ncylinders. The main target of calendering is to modify the surface structure and/or the sheet \n\nthickness. In the case of printing, the main calendering targets are to reduce surface \n\nroughness and compress the pore structure to obtain a good printing result. Two different \n\noptions can be used for calendering: hard rolls, made from cast iron or soft rolls, with \n\npolymer coverage. The latter distribute the calendering pressure more evenly creating a \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M. T. Moutinho 8 \n\nmore uniform surface finish and are currently the option preferably used in the industry \n\n(Oittinen and Saarelma 1998). \n\nRegarding the chemical treatment, it should be mentioned that the main difference between \n\ncoating and surface sizing is that the former involves pigments in the solution that is applied \n\nto the paper surface, in concentrations that are in general larger than 3.5 g/m2. Pigments \n\nsuch as clay, talc, and calcium carbonate are often used to produce the coating formulations \n\nin order to further enhance the printability of fibrous sheets (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998) \n\n(Donigian et al. 1997; Nissi et al. 1999; Lohmander and Rigdahl 2000; Ahlroos and gr\u00f6n \n\n2001; Fardim 2002; Concei\u00e7\u00e3o et el. 2003; Forsstr\u00f6m et al. 2003; Ridgway and Gane \n\n2003; Garcia 2004; Putkisto et al. 2004; Engstr\u00f6m 2005). \n\nSurface sizing is the subject this work and will be detailed in the following section. \n\n \n\n1.3.1 SURFACE SIZING \n\nSurface sizing is a common operation in any paper mill of P&amp;W papers. It consists in the \n\napplication of an aqueous suspension composed of several functional chemicals at the \n\nsurface of the paper, mainly to improve surface resistance, increase paper stiffness and \n\nimprove paper printability. \n\nThere are two types of formulations that can be used in surface sizing: starch alone or starch \n\ncombined with a synthetic surface sizing agent. The most common option in the industry is to \n\nperform surface sizing by using starch alone (usually modified starch - cationic), however \n\nthere is an increasing tendency, already applied in several paper mills, to combine the \n\ncationic starch with some synthetic surface sizing agents (Browning 1977; Bauer et al. 1999; \n\nSequera 1999; Keskitalo 2000; Lehtinen 2000; Lee et al. 2002; Carceller and Juppo2004; \n\nAndersson et al. 2006; Prinz and Schultz 2007). \n\nWhen both starch and synthetic surface sizing agents are used, the most important function of \n\nthe starch is to act as a binder, in order to produce an even blend. As for the synthetic \n\nsurface sizing agents, their use is often necessary because the primary raw material of \n\npaper and paperboard is the hydrophilic component cellulose. As these synthetic surface \n\nsizing agents are usually polymers with some degree of hydrophobicity, the paper surface \n\nbecomes water resistant, which is crucial for many printing processes (Oittinen and Saarelma \n\n1998; Keskitalo 2000; Lehtinen 2000; Glittenberg and Leonhardt 2007).  \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 9 \n\nIt should be pointed out that besides starch (usually cationic) and, in some cases, the synthetic \n\nsurface sizing agents, the sizing formulations include additional compounds, such as salt, \n\noptical brightener agents (OBA) and defoaming agents. \n\n \n\nStarch is a natural polymer consisting of glucose monomers. It is the second most abundant \n\nbiologically produced organic material after cellulose. Chemically, the starch polymer is \n\nmuch like cellulose. The difference lies in the structure which gives these two materials \n\ndifferent properties, as illustrated in Figure 1.3 (Bauer et al. 1999; Lehtinen 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 - Structure of starch and cellulose. \n\n \n\nAs indicated in Figure 1.3, the difference relies in the way glucose monomers are bonded. The \n\nbonds between glucose units are called glycosidic bonds, and their orientation is different in \n\ncellulose and starch. In starch, all glycosidic bonds are oriented in the same direction \n\nwhereas, in cellulose, the orientation of two consecutive bonds is opposite. This is the reason \n\nfor cellulose being a straight polymer while starch is coiled. Cellulose forms fibers, which are \n\npartly crystalline, while starch is totally amorphous and forms granules with different shapes \n\nand sizes depending on which plant they come from (corn, wheat, potato, and tapioca are \n\ncommon sources) (Bauer et al. 1999; Lehtinen 2000). \n\nIn the paper industry, the starch is previously cooked by steam. During the cooking process, \n\nthe starch granules start to swell, at 40\u00b0C - 50\u00b0C, and after that, the starch polymers start to \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M. T. Moutinho 10 \n\ndissolve. Starch has binding properties only in the dissolved form (seeFigure 1.4) (Bauer et \n\nal. 1999; Lehtinen 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4 - Starch during cooking. \n\n \n\nCooked native starch tends to be very viscous and forms gels at very low dry solids. This \n\nbehavior is called retrogradation because the starch polymers strive to rebind to each other \n\nand to form irreversible gels. Thus, starch for surface sizing is usually modified to ensure its \n\ngood functionality, by improving and/or controlling its binding power, rheology, viscosity-\n\ntemperature stability, and tendency to degradation. In the particular case of the starch \n\nmodified for application in surface sizing, the most important modification that it is submitted \n\nis cationization, making it positively charged, bi the addition of H+ functional groups, in order \n\nto increase the affinity for the anionic surface of the cellulose fibers (Bauer et al. 1999; \n\nLehtinen 2000; Glittenberg and Leonhardt 2007).  \n\nThe synthetic surface sizing agents are usually polymeric compounds, totally or partially \n\nhydrophobic. Typically the chemical bases used to produce synthetic surface sizing agents \n\nare styrene, maleic anhydride, acrylic acid, ester or polyurethanes (Brand\u00e3o 1999; Exner \n\n2001; Sreekumar et al. 2007; Prinz and Schultz 2007). \n\nWhen combined with starch, a thin reticular film is formed at the paper surface, as depicted \n\nin Figure 1.5. This film influences several paper properties such as smoothness, surface \n\nresistance, surface free energy and hydrophobicity. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

Until the beginning of the 1980\u2019s, the pond size press \n\ntechnology was the most used. In this system, the paper passes through a pond with the sizing \n\nblend and after, between two cylinders, as depicted in Figure 1.6 (Lehtinen 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.6 \u2013 Schematic representation of a pond size press. \n\n \n\nThis main advantage of this technology presented is the penetration depth of the sizing \n\nblend, giving z-directional strength to the paper. However, it limited paper machine speeds \n\nto approximately 1000 m/min. The main breakthrough in surface sizing technology, \n\nintroduced in the 1980\u2019s, was the appearance of the film size press technology. In this \n\nmethod, the sizing blend is applied in the rolls, in the desired amount, and not directly onto \n\nthe paper. The paper is passed through those rolls to allow the transfer of the blend, as \n\ndepicted in Figure 1.7 (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Lehtinen 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M.

Moutinho 12 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.7 \u2013 Schematic representation of a film size press. \n\n \n\nOne of the main advantages of the film press technology is the metering elements that allow \n\nuniform films to be formed on the transfer roll surface. During the last years, film presses \n\nwere the technology selected for the new woodfree paper machines installed and at the \n\nsame time, most pond size presses on larger machines have been converted into film presses. \n\nThe introduction of the film press technique has improved surface properties, such as dusting \n\nof the paper surface, due to reduced sizing penetration (Keskitalo 2000; Lehtinen 2000).  \n\nRegardless the technology used, the surface sizing operation is affected by the sizing \n\nformulation properties (composition, viscosity, pH, temperature) as well as the base paper \n\nproperties (basis weight, bulk, internal sizing, water content and surface energy, porosity \n\nand roughness). Thus, these properties must be adequately controlled, mainly in order to \n\ncontrol the penetration of the surface sizing blend in the sheet structure. \n\n \n\nCurrently, this is an area of the papermaking process where many attention has been \n\nfocused, due to the increasing importance attributed to the surface properties of the paper. \n\nThus, this is a research area under high development and many related studies have been \n\npublished in the open literature (Borch 1982; Aspler et al. 1987; Aspler et al. 1993; Mangin \n\n1993; Lee et al. 2002; Ajerschi et al. 2004; Carceller and Juppo 2004; Laleg 2004; \n\nLertsutthiwong et al. 2004; Me\u0161ic et al. 2004; Andersson et al. 2006; Glittenberg and \n\nLeonhardt 2007; Gu et al. 2007; Moutinho et al. 2007b; Olkkonen and Lipponen2007; \n\nPrinz and Schultz 2007; Sreekumar et al. 2007; Ashori et al. 2008; Moutinho et al. 2008a). \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 13 \n\n1.4 CHARACTERIZATION OF PAPER SURFACE \n\nThe evaluation of the effect of any surface modification requires a deep knowledge of the \n\npaper surface characteristics. Surface characterization can be undertaken either from the \n\nphysical or the chemical point of view, and many techniques have been used for that \n\npurpose. \n\nPhysical characterization of the paper surface is a more explored subject, since it is long \n\nestablished that properties such as porosity or roughness decisively influence paper \n\nperformance. Thus profilometry (Gadelmawla et al. 2002; W\u00e5gberg and Johansson 2002; \n\nBarros 2004; Ashori et al. 2008; TrueGage 2008), mercury porosimetry (Knauf and Doshi \n\n1986; Johnson et al. 1999; Moura et al. 2005), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) (Chinga \n\nand Helle 2002b), Confocal microscopy (Conners and Banerjee 1995), and more recently, \n\nAtomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (Chhabra et al. 2005; Das et al. 2006), are now currently \n\nused to investigate the characterize paper. \n\nRegarding the surface chemical properties, modern and sophisticated techniques have been \n\nimplemented (or adapted) for the  chemical characterization of paper sheets, namely contact \n\nangle measurements (Roe et al. 1967; Brigs et al. 1989; Marmur 2006), Fourier Transform \n\nInfrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) (Liu et al1998; Ernstsson 2005; Fardim and Dur\u00e1n 2005), \n\nElectronic Spectroscopy for Chemical analysis (ESCA/XPS) (Brinen 1993; Belgacem et al. \n\n1995; Kangas and Kleen2004), Inverse Gas Chromatography (IGC) (Gutierrez et al. 1999; \n\nKunaver et al. 2004; Wang and Sain 2007), Time of Flight \u2013 Second Ion Mass Spectroscopy \n\n(ToF-SIMS) (Kleen et al. 2003; Koljonen 2004; Lee et al. 2006) and Raman Spectroscopy \n\n(Vy\u00f6rykk\u00e4 2005). Most of these techniques were used in the present work, although some of \n\nthem were only applied in some specific studies an on a few samples, in order to complement \n\nthis study. In both cases the main objective is to provide information about paper surface that \n\nenables a better knowledge of the surface performance, in particular the paper-ink \n\ninteractions, most relevant for P&amp;W papers. The basic principle of the techniques used for \n\nthe majority of the samples will be described in later chapters together with the \n\ncorresponding results.  \n\n \n\n1.5 PRINTING \n\nPaper is definitely the most important raw material in printing. The techniques and \n\nprocedures used to produce printed products have evolved tremendously specially over the \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M.

Since then, many and revolutionary steps have been \n\ngiven, especially in the 20th century, from flexography, gravure, and offset to the modern \n\ndigital printing and techniques (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Keskitalo 2000).  \n\n \n\nTable 1.2 - Development of printing and other visualization methods. \n\nVisualization Method Year \nLetterpress 700 \nLetterpress, metal type 1450 \nLithography 1800 \nPhotography 1820 \nMotion picture 1895 \nGravure 1900 \nFlexography 1900 \nTelevision 1926 \nPhoto copying 1940 \nComputer display 1973 \nElectronic printing 1980 \nNetworked printing 1990 \nElectronic publishing on display 1990 \nDistributed color printing 1995 \n\n \n\nThe traditional methods are usually called mechanical printing, in order to expresses the fact \n\nthat the energy for image formation in the printing step is pressure. The term \u201cmechanical\u201d \n\ndistinguishes conventional printing methods from electronic or digital printing methods, which \n\nare based on computer output. \n\nMechanical printing uses the rotary principle in which printing ink transfers to the paper in a \n\nnip between two rotating cylinders. The imaging steps during mechanical printing procedures \n\ninclude transfer of the ink to a plate, ink transfer from the plate to the paper, and ink drying \n\n(Oittinen and Saarelma 1998).

Laser printing, uses a laser to expose the non-\n\nimage areas of a charger photoconductive drum,  and the image areas, which remain \n\ncharged, pick up a thin layer of oppositely charged toner particles. The drum then transfers \n\nthe toner particles to the paper. In Inkjet printing by directing individual drops to a paper \n\nsurface an image is created (Keskitalo 2000). Because of its ability to print on a variety of \n\nsubstrates, inkjet technology is also increasingly used in industrial printing and in the package \n\nprinting industry (Svanholm 2004). And thus, due to its current and increasing importance in \n\nthe printing market related to the paper type under study in this work, inkjet printing was the \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 17 \n\nmethod selected to perform printing quality evaluation in this work, and thus it will be further \n\ndeveloped in Chapter 8. \n\n \n\n1.5.1 PRINTING QUALITY \n\nRegardless the printing method involved and the purpose of the printed material, printing \n\nquality evaluation is always done, as a control tool or at least by the final user of the printed \n\nmaterial. Print quality definition does not have absolute terms it depends on interactions \n\nbetween paper and printing ink and the printing process variables (Oittinen and Saarelma \n\n1998; Levlin and S\u00f6derhjelm 2000).  \n\nThe performance of paper in printing depends on its runnability and printability. Runnability \n\nrelates to the factors that determine how the paper runs in the press. Printability factors \n\nconcern to quality of paper in relation to ink and printing (Oittinen and Saarelma, 1998). \n\nThus, the final performance of a paper, in terms of printing quality achieved depends on the \n\nproperties of the fibrous matrix and on the characteristics of the paper surface, which are \n\ninfluenced by the quality of the pulp fibers, the refining process, the chemicals added in the \n\npreparation of the furnish, the operations at the paper machine and the modifications of the \n\npaper surface (Levlin and S\u00f6derhjelm, 2000; Moutinho et al. 2007b). \n\nQuantitative evaluation of printing quality is very difficult but very important, that is why in \n\nthe last years the number of studies regarding this subject has increased substantially \n\n(Varnella 1998; Donigian et al. 1999; Keskitalo 2000; Chen et al. 2002; Donderi et al. \n\n2003; Mattila et al. 2003; Rosenberger 2003; Glittenberg and Voigt 2004; Danby and \n\nZhou 2004; Svanholm 2004; Lee et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2005; Olsson et al. 2006; \n\nM\u00e4kenen et al. 2007; Sreekumar et al. 2007; Ungh et al. 2007) \n\n \n\n1.6 ABOUT THE WORK \n\nThe work described in this thesis was motivated by the need of increasing the knowledge in \n\nspecific fields related to paper ink interactions. This need was driven by the growing \n\nimportance of the printing quality in the costumer demands and by the recognition of paper \n\nsurface modification as a major tool to improve the quality of many paper products as \n\ndescribed in Section 1.3 \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M. T. Moutinho 18 \n\nBesides the scarce information on this topic in the open literature, the available information is \n\nnot focused in printing and writing papers produced with eucalyptus globulus fibers, which is \n\nthe core of the Portuguese papermaking industry. Thus this study is pioneer in the surface \n\nstudies of paper and also and in particular in the context the Portuguese paper industry and \n\nresearch. \n\nBefore embracing this larger and longer work, a previous one was performed, as \n\nundergraduate student, whose main purpose was to compare the impact of different surface \n\nsizing agents on the surface properties and printing quality of paper sheets prepared in the \n\nlaboratory. Despite the limitation of using handsheets, this work pointed out many aspects \n\nthat required further investigation (Moutinho et al. 2004). Furthermore, it provided a first \n\ncontact with this field, namely with the phenomena related to the interactions between paper \n\nand sizing formulation and/or printing inks as well as with techniques currently used to \n\ncharacterize the surface of the paper samples. This constituted the main incentive for this \n\nproject that includes the present thesis, whose main objective is to analyze the effect of the \n\naddition of different types of synthetic surface sizing agents to the more classical surface \n\nsizing blend (composed of cationic starch) on the properties of commercial paper sheets, in \n\nparticular, on inkjet printing performance. In order to apply the obtained results and \n\nconclusions to the industry, all the steps of the work followed as close as possible the \n\nindustrial practice. Furthermore the selection of the surface sizing was also performed having \n\nthis point in mind.  \n\nFinally, it is important to stress that this work is focused on surface sizing and not on coating. \n\nThe main difference between these two surface treatments lies on the fact that the coating \n\nblends include pigments and the amount applied is usually above 6 g/m2. Moreover printing \n\nand writing papers (P&amp;W) are not usually coated. \n\nThe experimental work carried out in order to achieve these goals involves the following \n\nmain steps:  \n\n? Characterization/identification of the compounds used in the surface sizing \n\nblends. These were composed of cationic starch and different proportions of \n\nsynthetic sizing agents. The sizing agents used ranged from styrene acrylate \n\ncopolymers that have been recently applied for surface sizing at industrial level, to \n\nmelamine copolymers that are not usually used for this purpose. The formulation \n\nconstituted only by cationic starch was taken as reference, as it is the most commonly \n\nused. It should be highlighted that some of the sizing agents tested possessed distinct \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 19 \n\nchemical composition whereas others had identical composition but different \n\nmolecular configurations. Additionally, the influence of their incorporation \n\npercentage was also investigated, using incorporation percentages of 5, 10 and \n\n20%. \n\n? Production of the surface sized samples. Preliminary studies were undertaken in \n\norder to optimize the surface sizing procedure. These included the selection of the \n\nformulations to be applied and the identification of the variables to be controlled, as \n\nwill be detailed in Section 2.1.2. Additionally, also a methodology to guarantee the \n\ntraceability of each paper sheet used was set. \n\n? Physical and Chemical characterization of the samples. As the major concern is \n\nabout surface behavior, the characterization techniques focus mainly surface \n\nenergetics (contact angle e inverse gas chromatography), surface topography \n\n(profilometry), and porosity (mercury porosimetry). It should be pointed out that \n\nthese techniques are not used as routine and thus, a previous work was needed \n\nregarding each one of them, to establish the most adequate operating conditions \n\nand to fully interpret their results. Additionally, some of the samples were analyzed \n\nwith more sophisticated techniques as AFM or ESCA in order to investigate specific \n\ndetails. \n\n? Evaluation of the inkjet printing performance of the samples. This is not a simple \n\nissue as it is a subject not usually disclosed in the open literature, and thus all the \n\nmethodology was developed specifically for this work, using the available \n\ntechnologies. \n\nThe surface sizing operation, which is the focus of this work, represents at the most 5% of the \n\npaper structure, depending on the paper basis weight, and the differences between the \n\nsamples are necessarily limited by this fact. Thus it should be highlighted that previously to \n\nany analysis of the characterization results, these were subjected to Analysis of Variance \n\n(ANOVA), to guarantee that the differences between the samples were statistically valid. \n\nThis document is organized in 11 Chapters: \n\nIn this chapter (Introduction) some generic information regarding the papermaking process, \n\nsurface sizing, paper surface characterization and printing in presented. It is also given a \n\ngeneral overview of the work in order to frame the reader into its purpose and \n\nmethodology. \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M.

However the characterization techniques are fully detailed in \n\nfurther chapters together with the corresponding results.  \n\nChapter 3 (Characterization of the Sizing Chemicals) covers the methodology developed to \n\ndetermine the composition and the properties of the compounds used in the sizing \n\nformulations (starch and synthetic surface sizing agents). \n\n The following chapters concern the physical and chemical characterization of the paper \n\nsurface of all 31 samples produced. Chapters 4, 5, 6, 7 regard, respectively, to \n\nprofilometry, mercury porosimetry, contact angle measurements, and inverse gas \n\nchromatography (IGC).The structure of theses chapters is similar. They are all divided in two \n\nsub-sections: firstly the principles of the technique, details and the methodology used are \n\ndescribed and, secondly, the corresponding results are presented and analyzed. \n\nChapter 8 (Printing Quality) covers the method used to evaluate the inkjet printing \n\nperformance of the samples and the corresponding results. Mathematical models were \n\nimplemented in order to correlate the values of the printing parameters with the surface \n\nproperties determined in the previous chapters. \n\nChapter 9 (Complementary Studies) is a compilation of scientific papers (published and \n\nsubmitted) regarding specific aspects of the work. These papers involve either only a few \n\nsamples and/or a particular characterization technique which were found adequate to point \n\nout a particular aspect of the work. \n\nChapter 10 (Conclusions) summarizes the main conclusions that can be withdrawn from this \n\nstudy and points out some suggestions for future work. \n\nChapter 11 (References) is used to list the most relevant publications consulted to accomplish \n\nthis work, were detailed information on a given subject can be consulted. \n\nThe thesis is also complemented by a series of appendices (Appendix A to G.) where \n\nadditional information is presented, mainly in tables and plots.

This paper was calendered \n\n(20 KN/m calendering pressure) and had no surface chemical treatment of any kind. \n\nThe Mathis laboratory device, model SVA-IR-B (illustrated in Figure 2.2), was used for paper \n\nsheet surface sizing. It operates automatically with velocities ranging from 1 to 10 m/min \n\nand can be used with three applicator rolls of different diameters. A preliminary study was \n\nundertaken in order to optimize the sizing procedure. The main goal was to obtain a sizing \n\namount (pick-up) similar to that of industrial scale (usually approximately between 2 and 5 \n\ng/m2). This was achieved using the 0.15 mm roll in conjunction with a velocity of 6 m/min. A \n\npick-up of 3.5 \u00b1 0.3 g/m2 (including both faces) was reached for these operating conditions. \n\nAdditionally, and to minimize the migration of the sizing formulations into the fibrous matrix \n\npaper samples were subsequently dried (Figure 2.2) using the maximum intensity available \n\nfor the IR dryer (1.0 kW).  \n\nDue to equipment limitations, the sizing process was performed separately for each side of \n\nthe paper sheets. The uniformity of the application with the selected conditions was \n\nconfirmed using a colored blend (by sizing the paper sheet with a colored blend it is easily \n\nobserved the evenness for the color distribution at the surface, indicating that the equipment \n\nallows good uniformity). The surface sized samples produced were no further calendered \n\nsince this mechanical operation could mask the effect of the different sizing formulations in \n\nwhat concerns the physical properties of the paper surface.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

For each set the following was observed: \n\n? Identification of each of the A3 paper sheets used; \n\n? Determination of the exact net basis weight of each unsized paper sheet (weight of \n\neach paper sheet and basis weight calculation according to the dimensions;  \n\n? Sizing of a set of 20 paper sheets for each sizing formulation, according to the \n\nprocedure described above;  \n\n? Determination of the net basis weight after surface sizing and consequent determination \n\nof the surface sizing pick-up (from the weight difference). \n\n? Selection of the paper sheets with adequate pick-up (3.5 \u00b1 0.3 g/m2 in both sides); \n\nFor each surface sizing formulation, an average of 10 paper sheets with the required pick-\n\nup was obtained. \n\n \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M. T. Moutinho 26 \n\n2.1.2 SIZING FORMULATIONS \n\nAs mentioned before (Chapter 1), the most common sizing formulation applied in \n\npapermaking is cationic starch alone; however there is an increasing tendency, already \n\napplied in several paper mills, of combine the cationic starch with some synthetic surface \n\nsizing agents. \n\nThus and in order to be as close as possible to the industrial practice, the first sizing \n\nformulation used in the present work was also cationic starch, which was taken as reference. \n\nThe cationic starch suspension was collected immediately before the size press of the paper \n\nmachine and consequently includes all the size press additives (such as OBA, salt, biocide and \n\nanti-foam). Subsequently other sizing formulations were tested, in a total 30, consisting of \n\nblends of cationic starch and small amounts of synthetic surface sizing agents (up to 20% \n\nw/w). The latter were not only copolymers containing styrene and acrylate, also commonly \n\nused in the paper industry, but also included styrene, acrylate and melamine based \n\ncompounds in order to expand the chemical variability of the sizing agents tested. Table 2.1 \n\nlists the compounds used in the preparation of the surface sizing formulations and the \n\ncorresponding abbreviations. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 \u2013 Compounds used in the surface sizing formulations. \n\nCompound Reference \nCationic starch (used as reference) St \nCo-styrene-acrylate* S1 \nCo-styrene-maleic anhydride  S2 \nCo-acrylonitrile-acrylate  S3 \nCo-styrene-maleic anhydride  S4 \nQuaternary ditallow methyl epoxypropyl ammonium S5 \nMethylated Melamine S6 \nCo-styrene-dimethylaminopropylamine maleimide S7 \nCo-styrene-butyl acrylate  S8 \nCo-styrene-acrylate* S9 \nCo-styrene-acrylate* S10 \n\n                                  * Different monomers proportion \n\n \n\nAlthough cationic starch was the predominant component of the blends, concentrations of 5, \n\n10 and 20% of the different synthetic surface sizing agents were used. An incorporation of \n\n10% is usually found in the paper mills for this kind of formulations, being  20% the \n\nmaximum allowed in a paper machine, namely due to white water contamination problems. \n\nIn the present work 5% incorporation percentage was additionally selected in order to \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 27 \n\nexpand the concentration range of the surface sizing agent providing a better picture of its \n\ninfluence. \n\nThe nomenclature used to identify the sizing formulations was:  \n\nStSi-j \n\nMeaning St that the blend contains cationic starch, taken as standard (St), while Si-j indicates \n\nthat the blend includes surface sizing agent Si (i varies from 1 to 10, see Table 2.1), in the \n\npercentage j (j equals 5, 10 or 20 w/w). For instance, formulation StS2-10 is composed of \n\ncationic starch and surface sizing agent S2 (Co-styrene-maleic anhydride, Table 3.1) in a \n\npercentage of 10 of S2 and (consequently) 90% of cationic starch. In Appendix B are \n\nsummarized the blends composition. \n\n \n\n2.2 CHARACTERIZATION OF THE SURFACE SIZING AGENTS \n\nThe knowledge of the characteristics of the compounds used to prepare the surface sizing \n\nformulations, in what concerns either their chemical composition or their physical and chemical \n\nproperties, as this information is crucial to relate the resultant surface modifications with the \n\nperformance of the sized paper sheets, namely in terms of printing quality. \n\nSince most of the co-polymers used as surface sizing agents were commercial products, the \n\ninformation about their chemical characteristics, provided by the corresponding datasheets \n\n(Appendix A), was rather limited (or confidential). Thus, it was necessary to carry out some \n\nadditional measurements namely density, elemental analysis, particle size, pH, solids content \n\nand total surface tension. As described later (Chapter 3) this information enabled the \n\nschematic representation of the compounds molecules.  \n\n \n\n2.3 PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PAPER SAMPLES \n\nThe characterization of the paper samples produced was performed by using several \n\ntechniques, listed in Table 2.2. Some of these techniques (profilometry, mercury porosimetry, \n\ncontact angle and IGC) were applied for all samples, while others (AFM, ESCA, ToF-SIMS \n\nand SEM) could only be applied in some samples (mainly because they are not available in \n\nour laboratories).

The quantitative measurements \n\ninclude: Optical Density, measured by the spectrophotometer Gretag D19C;  Gamut Area, \n\ndetermined through the CIE Lab color coordinates obtained for six colors by using the \n\nAvaMouse spectrophotometer (Avantes); and Line quality, evaluated using the Personal  \n\nImage Analysis system PIA BASF \u2013 8042319 for the black line with yellow background. \n\nSubjective evaluation was based on the observation of a panel members and subsequent \n\nclassification of the printed images depicted in Figure 2.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3 \u2013 Mask used to evaluate inkjet printing quality. \n\n \n\nThe theoretical and technical details as well as definitions and results regarding printing \n\nquality are given in Chapter 8. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 3 \n\n \n\nCHARACTERIZATION OF THE SIZING CHEMICALS \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

Figure 3.1 illustrates, as an example, the typical \n\ninformation available in a datasheet (a copy of all the available datasheets used is given in \n\nAppendix A) \n\nAs it can be seen, besides the name of the compound (monomer), the data provided in those \n\ndatasheets is rather vague (frequently corresponding to a range rather than to an accurate \n\nvalue). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Example of the information available in a product datasheet  \n\n \n\nXXX XXX XXX \n\n\n\n   Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M.

However, nothing is revealed about the monomers proportion. \n\nAlthough several attempts were made to experimentally determine this parameter, a trial \n\nand error procedure was found to be necessary to establish this proportion for each sizing \n\nagent used. \n\nThe methodology followed, described in Figure 3.2 in the form of a flowchart, was based on \n\nthree types of inputs: \n\n? Identification of the monomers present in each copolymer (given in the datasheet); \n\n? Chemical composition of each monomer (NIST database, 2004) \n\n?  Elemental composition (N, C, H, O) experimentally determined by elemental analysis \n\n(Table 3.1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

Density was measured by liquid picnometry, following ISO 758 method. \n\n? Particle size was determined, from a dilute suspension previously sonicated, by photon \n\ncorrelation spectroscopy using the COULTER\u00ae N4 Plus. Three independent samples were \n\nprepared and three measurements were taken for each one.  \n\n? pH measurements were performed following ISO 787-9 method (Lehtinen, 2000). \n\n? Solids content determination was carried out at 105 \u00baC (SCAN-P 39:80) (Lehtinen, \n\n2000). \n\n? The total surface tension was determined using the contact angle measurement device \n\nOCA20 from Dataphysics (as described in detail in Chapter 6) using the pendant drop \n\nmethod.  \n\nThe results obtained for the several properties are gathered in Table 3.3. However, in some \n\ncases, these properties could not be measured due to experimental restrictions (eg. Some \n\nsurface tension values could not be achieved due to the viscosity of some sizing agents). \n\n \n\nTable 3.3 \u2013 Compounds Properties. \n\nCompound Solids (%) pH Particle Size (nm) Density (g/cm3) Surface Tension (mN/m) \nSt 12.0 5.0 298.8 \u00b1 8.4 1.049 \u00b1 0.05 32.90 \u00b1 0.11 \nS1 25.2 5.0 66.8 \u00b1 0.9 1.009 \u00b1 0.03 64.38 \u00b10.18 \nS2 15.0 8.4 37.2 \u00b1 5.2 --- --- \nS3 35.2 3.2 254.5 \u00b1 8.6 1.051\u00b1 0.03 49.61 \u00b1 0.05 \nS4 14.6 7.6 25.4 \u00b1 3.6 1.008 \u00b1 0.05 38.51 \u00b1 0.02 \nS5 6.60 9.2 --- --- --- \nS6 73.0 7.3 --- --- --- \nS7 99.1 10.0 --- --- --- \nS8 30.7 2.8 88.9 \u00b1 1.7 1.022 \u00b1 0.02 43.22 \u00b1 0.03 \nS9 25.7 4.3 83.6 \u00b1 0.5 1.008 \u00b1 0.10 49.99 \u00b1 0.07 \n\nS10 25.5 4.7 73.8 \u00b1 0.8 0.998 \u00b1 0.11 64.33 \u00b1 0.04 \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

Paper is no exception for this rule of \n\nnature, since its surface is always textured (Thomas 1998). \n\nThe surface texture, most commonly called topography, is often crucial for the end-use \n\nproperties of any type of paper. For printing and writing papers (P&amp;W), surface texture is a \n\nphysical characteristic which results from the production process itself and it is an important \n\nfactor affecting printability (Ashori et al. 2007). \n\nIn the surface topography of P&amp;W papers, four components can be distinguished, according \n\nto the scale: form, waviness, roughness and micro-roughness, as depicted in Figure 4.1 \n\n(Wagberg and Johansson 2002; URL 2; URL 3): \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Different surface texture components (URL 2; URL 3). \n\n \n\nAmong the components of the surface topography of P&amp;W papers, roughness and micro-\n\nroughness stand out from the remaining, since due to the topographic range to which it \n\ncorresponds it becomes the most relevant to be considered for printing processes. From this \n\npoint on, the term roughness will include these two components of surface texture. \n\nRoughness directly controls gloss and also has a major role in determining printing quality \n\nand uniformity.  Thus, it is an important property to be accessed in order to adequately \n\ncharacterize paper surface. From its measurements several parameters are obtained, which \n\nare usually called topographical parameters. \n\nTopographical parameters can be computed from two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional \n\n(3D) profile analysis of the paper surface. The calculation of 2D parameters has widely \n\nbeen carried out in science and engineering for almost a century. However, in more recent \n\nyears, there has been evidence of an increasing need for 3D surface analysis.  \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M. T. Moutinho 44 \n\nThis need arises partially as a result of the recognition that all surfaces interact in three \n\nrather than two dimensions. In some cases 2D parameters introduced in many national and \n\ninternational standards are inadequate to give a comprehensive description of 3D surfaces \n\nand thus unable to meet the need of a wide variety of applications (Stout at al. 1993; Dong \n\net al. 1994a; Dong et al. 1994b; W\u00e5gberg 2002). \n\nThe functional applications of the materials in fields like wear, friction, lubrication, fatigue, \n\nsealing, painting, etc., are deeply influenced by the amplitude and spatial characteristics of \n\nthe 3D surface topography of the materials (Dong et al. 1994a). \n\n \n\n4.1.1 ROUGHNESS PARAMETERS DEFINITION \n\n3D topography is complex and cannot be described completely by a single or a few \n\nparameters.  \n\nEach one of the roughness parameters reduce all the information in a profile to a single \n\nnumber which is calculated using a specific formula. As each parameter only describes one \n\naspect of the topography, a set of parameters is necessary to accurately characterize \n\nsurface topography (Dong et al 1994a; W\u00e5gberg 2002). \n\nSome of these parameters are naturally extended from their 2D counterparts; others are \n\nuniquely defined for 3D topography. Currently, in order to distinguish 2D and 3D \n\nparameters, a capital letter \u201cS\u201d (meaning that it is calculated from an area (or surface) \n\nrather than a line) is used to identify 3D parameters whereas a capital \u201cR\u201d is traditionally \n\nused for 2D parameters (Stout et al. 1993; Dong et al 1994a; Dong et al 1994b; Cohen \n\n2006). \n\n3D measurement systems are all digital height measurement systems. They represent the \n\nmeasured surface with a set of data usually in the form of a x-y matrix of the Cartesian \n\ncoordinate, where x and y spacing are not necessarily the same (Stout et al. 1993; Dong et \n\nal. 1994a; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008). \n\nAn equally spaced digitalized 3D surface, can be denoted by z(xi, yj) (xi=i?x, yj=j?y; \n\ni=1,2,\u2026M; j=1,2,\u2026,N), where ?x and ?y are the sampling intervals, and M and N \n\nrepresent the number of sampling points in the x and y directions, respectively (Stout et al. \n\n1993; Dong et al. 1994a; Cohen 2006; TrueGage 2008). \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 45 \n\nParameters used to describe surfaces are mainly statistical indicators that can be divided in \n\namplitude parameters, spacing parameters and hybrid parameters. \n\n \n\n4.1.1.1 Amplitude Parameters \n\nAmplitude parameters, defined below, are a class of surface parameters based on the \n\nvertical deviations of the roughness profile from the mean plane, i.e. the best fitting plane, \n\nalso called reference plane (Figure 4.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Exemplification of the deviations from the reference plane for a given profile line (Gadelmawla \n\net al. 2002).  \n\n \n\nMost of them are closely related to the parameters found in statistics for characterizing \n\npopulation samples. The reference plane of the calculation of these parameters is the mean \n\nplane of the measured surface (Stout et al. 1993; Gadelmawla et al. 2002; Cohen 2006; \n\nTrueGage 2008). \n\nThey can be divided in: i) dispersion; ii) asymmetry of the height distribution, and iii) extreme \n\nparameters. \n\n i) Dispersion Parameters \n\nSa - The roughness average - is the arithmetic average of the absolute values of the surface \n\nheight deviations (Figure 4.3) measured from the reference plane, given by: \n\n??\n==\n\n=\nM\n\ny\nyx\n\nN\n\nx\n\nZ\nNM\n\nSa\n1\n\n,\n1\n\n1\n                                                                                                (4.1) \n\nSa was one of the first parameters used to quantify surface texture and is the most \n\nuniversally recognized roughness parameter for general quality control.

Moreover, it is insensitive to their \n\nspatial distribution, in that two very high peaks will contribute the same to Sa whether the \n\npeaks are close to each other or separated.  In fact, surfaces with grossly different features \n\nmay have the same Sa.

One \n\ntype of measurement simulates the printing process under pressure, and the other, called \n\nprofilometry, determines an effective three-dimensional (3D) surface profile (Barros 2004; \n\nAshori et al, 2008). \n\nAir-leak methods, such as Bendtsen and Parker Print-Surf (PPS), were developed to simulate \n\nprinting pressure. Unfortunately air-leak meters have some drawbacks in paper surface \n\nresearch. Because the total airflow volume is measured, no information is obtained about the \n\nsurface structure in detail. In other words, traditional surface roughness assessing instruments \n\ngive average numbers for the measured area but do not provide any detailed description of \n\nthe paper surface. This makes such instruments less suitable for revealing details of the \n\nsurface treatments effect (Barros 2004; Ashori et al, 2008). \n\nAs for the determination of the three-dimensional (3D) surface profile, its purpose is to \n\npresent a surface profile under room conditions as accurately as possible. There are two \n\ntypes of methods to perform profilometry measurements: Contacting methods (Stylus \n\nprofilometry) and non-contacting methods (Optical profilometry). Laser and electron \n\nmicroscopy can also be applied for profilometry measurements, embracing both contacting \n\nand non-contacting methods (Barros 2004; Ashori et al 2008). \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M. T. Moutinho 52 \n\nThe Stylus instruments (Figure 4.9) are easily described as a mechanical instrument that \n\ncontacts with the surface under analysis and profiles it by following the surface details as \n\naccurately as possible. These instruments can have several configurations, particularly in what \n\nconcerns to the tip that touches the surface. Its simplicity, however, is associated to several \n\nlimitations: on one hand, since the instrument touches the surface, there is the risk of damaging \n\nit. On the other hand, since the stylus is an artifact of finite dimensions, it sometimes fails to \n\nfollow peaks and valleys faithfully and produces a distorted record of the surface. The \n\n\u201ctraced profile\u201d (ISO 3274, 1996) recorded by the Stylus instrument is the locus of the centre \n\nof the stylus, thus, if the contacting portion of the stylus is assumed to be spherical in section, \n\nthe radius of curvature of a peak may be exaggerated, while the valley may be \n\nrepresented as a cusp (Thomas, 1998; Barros 2004).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 - Principle of a contacting stylus instrument profilometer: A cantilever (1) is holding a small tip (2) \n\nthat is sliding along the horizontal direction (3) over the object's surface (5). Following the profile the \n\ncantilever is moving vertically (4). The vertical position is recorded as the measured profile (6) shown in light \n\ngreen. \n\n \n\nThe optical instruments used to access surface roughness are based in the simple principle \n\nthat when electromagnetic radiation is incident on a rough surface a portion of its energy, \n\ndepending on the local physical properties of the surface, will be reflected and the reflected \n\nbeam will carry information about the roughness (Thomas, 1998). The radiation may be \n\nreflected either specularly or diffusely or both (Figure 4.10). Reflection is totally specular \n\nwhen the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence (Snell\u2019s law), and a surface \n\nthat reflects radiation in this manner is said to be smooth. Reflection is totally diffuse when \n\nthe energy in the incident beam is distributed in all directions (Barros 2004; Thomas, 1998). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

Profiling techniques are associated with specular reflection, whereas \n\nparametric techniques are associated mainly with diffuse reflection (Thomas, 1998). One \n\npossible method of optical measurement is simply to use the light beam as a non-contacting \n\nstylus for profile measurement. The most straightforward method is to detect the change in \n\nthe angle of specular reflection as the surface is moved under an incident beam.  \n\nThere are some general aspects that have to be considered in order to choose a specific \n\nmeasuring instrument: cost, ease of operation, size and robustness. There is also the issue of \n\nwhether a measurement is relative or absolute. In addition, for roughness measuring \n\ninstruments, it is necessary to decide whether or not the instrument should have a physical \n\ncontact with the surface, and whether it needs to be able to measure an area of a surface or \n\nonly a section or profile through it. Most important of all are the horizontal and vertical \n\nrange and resolution. In fact every instrument or technique presents some limitations of \n\nresolution, and the actual values involved will vary from instrument to instrument (Thomas \n\n1998; Barros 2004). \n\n \n\n4.1.2.1 Equipment - Altisurf\u00ae 500 \n\nIn this work, and in order to obtain the roughness parameters without the effect of any \n\nexternal force, a non-contact profilometer was chosen, the Altisurf\u00ae500 profilometer \n\nmanufactured by Cotec-Ca (France), coupled with the PaperMap Software. This non-contact \n\ndevice gives accurate height information with the possibility of visual evaluation of the 3D \n\nsurface structure of paper samples (Bastos 2004; Ashori et al. 2007).  \n\nThe system consists of a white light source, lens, spectrophotometer, a signal processing \n\nsystem, together with a motorized sample holder and appropriate image analysis software \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M. T. Moutinho 54 \n\n(Figure 4.11). The white light source (quartz-halogen) is focused through the lens onto the \n\nsample to be analyzed. The reflected light is passed through a pinhole into a \n\nspectrophotometer where built-in software is used to select the wavelength of maximum \n\nintensity, which is used to determine the relative height of that point.  \n\nThe sample is fixed to the sample holder, which is scanned under an adequately positioned \n\nfixed sensor. A 3D surface profile (topographic map) can be created, visualizing the \n\nirregularities of the papers surface (two-dimensional line scans can also be measured). The \n\nsample holder moves the sample, by pre-programmed steps, under the focused beam. The \n\nresolution in the x and y directions (from 0.5 to 100 \u00b5m) and the area (up to 10\u00d710 cm) to \n\nbe measured are selectable. By choosing an appropriate filter (e.g., Gaussian) the roughness \n\nof interest can be obtained (Ashori et al. 2008; Levlin and S\u00f6derhjelm 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11\u2013 Schematic representation of the optical profilometer used in this work (Ashori et al. 2008). \n\n \n\nIn this study, for each paper sample, 6 pieces of 4\u00d74 mm2 were scanned, with a scanning \n\nresolution of 2 \u00b5m. Therefore 2000 profiles were obtained for each piece. From the data \n\nacquisition, a 3D surface profile is obtained (Figure 4.12 (a)), then several mathematical \n\noperations are performed in order to apply adequate mathematical filters to the results and  \n\nto highlight the relevant information, by excluding the surface texture components that are \n\nless relevant  (Figure 4.12 (b) to Figure 4.12 (e)).  \n\nThe mathematical treatment includes the following operators: \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 55 \n\n? Leveling operation \u2013 corresponds to the application of a mathematical filter to remove \n\nthe general slope of a surface, caused by a measurement that was not strictly \n\nhorizontal due to the inclination of the sample on the support used to fix it. Figure 4.12 \n\n(b) represents the analyzed area after this correction. \n\n? 4th degree polynomial form removal - This operator consists in mathematically \n\nremoving the general form of a surface. The remaining information, made up of \n\nwaviness and roughness, can then be studied separately (Figure 4.12 (c)).  \n\n? Filtering waviness and roughness (0.8 mm filter) - This operator is used to separate the \n\nroughness and waviness phenomena of the surface. The quality of the separation \n\ndepends both on the type of filter and the cut-off value. This process allows obtaining a \n\nroughness and a waviness surface that can then be studied individually (Figure 4.12 \n\n(d)). \n\n? Thresholding material ratios 0.5 (corresponding to 99.5%) - This operator allows to \n\nartificially truncate the surface at a given altitude (at the top and/or bottom). This \n\noperator is especially useful for suppressing peaks that are too large and that \n\ntherefore hide other relieves, or for simulating a wear process (Figure 4.12 (e)). \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n Isabel M.

Thus, the first step to work with valuable and useful information through the \n\nprofilometry measurements was to isolate the parameters that better characterize the \n\nsamples. In order to do that, a 2 components PCA was applied. For the purpose of paper \n\nsurface analysis it is possible to isolate, among all the parameters presented in Section 4.1.1, \n\n10 that may be considered the most relevant as the start point for the PCA analysis: Sa, Sq, \n\nSp, Sv, St, Ssk, Ssc, Str, Sdq and Sdr.

These seven parameters will be the ones used to analyze the \n\neffect of surface sizing in topography. It is important to mention that although the variable \n\nSdr was eliminated from this set due to its smaller descriptive power regarding the effect of \n\nsurface sizing in paper roughness, it will be used later in this work to correct the contact \n\nangle values (Section 6.2.1). \n\nBy applying ANOVA to the topographical parameters selected by PCA it is possible to \n\nanalyze in detail the variations in the results of each parameter.

Thus the \n\nuse of this analysis to perform truthful considerations is validated. \n\nAccording to results previously published by other authors (Str\u00f6m 2003; Ashori et al 2008), it \n\nis generally believed that a film (surface sizing and/or coating) on the top of a paper sheet \n\nreduces roughness by filling the depression irregularities of the paper surface. However, the \n\nmain observation that can be drawn from Table 4.1 is that there is a large variability within \n\nsamples, which indicates that the addition of the surface sizing agents to the cationic starch \n\nhas a reduced impact on the surface topography.  This was not totally unexpected, since \n\neven considering the largest percentage of surface sizing agent added (20%), the surface \n\nsizing blend is composed mainly of starch (80%). It should also be remembered that the main \n\nobjective of the copolymers addition is to change the chemical rather than the physical \n\nproperties of the surface. Detailed results corresponding to the several topographic \n\nparameters and additional plots can be consulted in Appendix C. Here, the analysis will be \n\nillustrated with the most adequate and relevant plots. \n\nIn order to have a general understanding of the surface topography of the samples, the most \n\nadequate variables, Sa and Sq, corresponding respectively to the average roughness and \n\nthe root mean square roughness deviation, are represented in Figure 4.17. \n\nFigure 4.17 presents the results according to the percentage of surface sizing agent added \n\nto the sizing blend. In these graphs the interval within which the differences from the \n\nstandard sample are not valid (based on the reproducibility factor) is also represented (the \n\ninterval between the dashed lines). \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

Porosity is a \n\ncritical factor in all sorts of paper, from printing papers, filter papers, cigarette papers to \n\nbag papers.  In particular for P&amp;W papers, porosity significantly affects opacity, bulk and \n\nthe ink reception process (Knauf and Doshi 1986; Johnson et al. 1999; Keskitalo 2000). In \n\nfact, porosity indicates how paper will react to fluid penetration in coating, sizing and \n\nprinting operations. Additionally, porosity can also be an important factor in a vacuum \n\nfeeding operation of a printing press (Johnson et al. 1999) \n\n \n\n5.1.1 MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES \n\nAlthough easy to define, paper porosity is hard to measure accurately and several \n\ntechniques can be employed to quantify the volume of voids, whose values greatly depend \n\nupon the method and the conditions used (Knauf and Doshi 1986; Murakami and Imamura \n\n1980). However, two types of procedures are frequently used for paper porosity \n\ndetermination: the air resistance and air permeability methods and the methods involving \n\nvolume or density measurements (Chinga and Helle 2002a; Bordurtha et al. 2005).  \n\nThe air resistance and air permeability methods are both based on the resistance to the \n\npassage of air offered by the paper structure when a pressure difference exists between \n\nthe two sides of the paper. The air resistance is measured as the time for a given volume of \n\nair to flow through a specimen under specified conditions, while the air permeability is \n\nmeasured as the volume of air which flows through the paper for a given time interval, \n\nfollowing the Sheffield Method (described in TAPPI T 547) or the Gurley Method (detailed in \n\nTAPPI T 460 and TAPPI T 536). Many papermakers rely upon Gurley Densometer tests to \n\nevaluate the porous nature of paper. However, it has been shown that the volume fraction \n\navailable to flow (permeability) is not equal to porosity: papers can have the same \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

This law, in the case of cylindrical pores and non wetting liquids like mercury is \n\nexpressed by the Washburn equation (Knauf and Doshi 1986; Bordurtha et al. 2005): \n\n?? cos4\n1\n\n??\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n??=\nP\n\nD                                                                                                   (5.2) \n\nwhere D is the pore diameter, P is the applied pressure, ? the surface tension, and ? the \n\ncontact angle, all in consistent units. As this equation shows, the larger the pore size, the lower \n\nthe pressure needed to overcome the capillary forces. Therefore the pore-size distribution \n\ncan be measured by gradually increasing the pressure on a vessel (called penetrometer, \n\nFigure 5.1) containing a piece of paper submerged in mercury and measuring the intake of \n\nthis by the paper after each increase of pressure. In this way a cumulative pore volume can \n\nbe determined as a function of the applied pressure (or pore diameter, inversely \n\nproportional to pressure as described Washburn eq.), starting with the volume of the largest \n\npores. The output is the so called intrusion curve. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

All this is full of mercury at \n\nthe lowest pressure. As pressure is increased, mercury penetrates into the sample pores (intrusion) and the \n\nlength of penetrometer stem that is filled with mercury decreases. The difference in mercury level corresponds \n\nto the volume intruded in the sample. \n\n \n\nHowever, real pores are never exactly cylindrical, and thus the measured pore radius is an \n\nequivalent circular pore radius. \n\nMercury porosimetry data is not limited to porosity and pore size distribution but this \n\ntechnique also provides information about bulk and skeletal density. Bulk density is the ration \n\nbetween the weight and the bulk volume, which includes the solid volume as well as the \n\nvolume of all empty spaces. This volume is measured at the lowest intrusion pressure.  In \n\nopposition the \u201cskeletal\u201d density, corresponding to the \u201cskeletal\u201d volume, refers to the volume \n\nof the sample discounting all the voids occupied by the mercury at the highest pressure \n\n(Micromeritics 2000). \n\n \n\n5.1.1.2 Equipment - AutoPore IV 9500 \n\nIn this study, the Micromeritics equipment AutoPore IV 9500 (Figure 5.2) was used to perform \n\nthe mercury porosimetry measurements for all the 31 samples produced.

Moutinho 71 \n\n5.2 RESULTS \n\nAs mentioned before, mercury data provides information not only about porosity but also \n\nabout intrusion volume (volume of mercury per sample weight) and density (bulk and \n\nskeletal). These values are tabulated in Table 5.1 for one of the measurements performed \n\nfor the reference sample (sized with cationic starch only) and for sample STS4-20, as an \n\nexample. All the other values can be found in Appendix D.   \n\n \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Exemplification of the mercury porosimetry output, using samples St and StS4-20. \n\nSample = St  Sample = StS4-20 \nTotal Intrusion Volume = 0.7624 ml/g  Total Intrusion Volume = 0.7851 ml/g \nBulk Density at 0.52 psia = 0.7450 g/ml  Bulk Density at 0.52 psia = 0.7181 g/ml \nApparent (skeletal) Density = 1.7246 g/ml  Apparent (skeletal) Density = 1.6464 g/ml \nPorosity = 56.8003 %  Porosity = 56.3830% \n \n\nAs it can be seen, and despite the different sizing formulations, the values obtained for the \n\ndifferent parameters are quite similar: intrusion volumes of about 0.77mL/g, bulk densities \n\nclose to 0.73 g/ml, skeletal densities of 1.65 and 1.72 g/ml and porosities of \n\napproximately 56% were obtained. Considering the totality of the samples tested the range \n\nof variation remains reduced: 0.68 - 0.85 ml/g for intrusion volume, 0.66 - 0.79 g/ml and \n\n1.45 - 1.80 g/ml for bulk and skeletal densities, respectively, and a variation between \n\n51.71 - 58.69 % regarding porosity. These values are in agreement with those published in \n\nliterature (Moura et al. 2005) \n\nRegarding the skeletal density, the values measured are in general larger than that of \n\ncellulose (1.55 g/ml) which is compatible with the fact that paper contains other denser \n\ncomponents besides cellulose fiber, such as fillers. \n\nIn Figure 5.3 are represented the intrusion curves (differential and cumulative) of the St \n\nSample, which exhibits two peaks: one at about 3 \u00b5m and another at about 20 \u00b5m. The \n\nsame is detected for all the samples tested, whose curves can be consulted in Appendix D. \n\nThis result is in agreement with the results obtained by other authors (Moura et al. 2005) for \n\npaper sheets and is usually associated to the mercury penetration into smaller pores of the \n\npaper internal structure. \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

T. Moutinho 73 \n\nIt should be pointed out that the effect of surface sizing on paper porosity has not been the \n\nsubject of many studies but the general idea is that it decreases paper porosity (Martin \n\n2008). Moreover regarding the effect of adding distinct copolymers no studies are \n\navailable in the open literature.  \n\nBefore continuing the study of the effect surface sizing on paper porosity, ANOVA was \n\napplied to the porosimetry data.

Nonetheless, it is worth to mention that, in general, \n\nthe contribution to the total variation of the variability within samples is larger than that \n\namong the different samples.

The importance of this \n\ninterface in lots of applications has led to extensive studies over the past 60 years (Brigs \n\n1989; Adamson 1997).The molecular contact between the solid and the liquid is called \n\nwetting and is essential in many applications such as spreading of coatings or adhesion and \n\nabsorption into porous solids as paper sheets. \n\nThe knowledge of the factors controlling the interaction between the paper and the different \n\nliquids used in the printing processes is fundamental in order to control and improve paper \n\nbehavior in printing operations (Aspler 1983; Garret and Lee 1998; Keskitalo 2000; Shen \n\net al. 2000; W\u00e5gberg and Westerlind 2000; Hoang et al. 2001; Sepp\u00e4nen et al. 2004; \n\nKannangara et al. 2006; Gu et al. 2007). \n\nIn printing techniques where water is used as solvent, such as inkjet printing, the wetting \n\nproperties of the paper are even more important, since ink does not stay at the surface but it \n\nspreads and is absorbed (Figure 6.1) before drying, naturally affecting print quality (Breda \n\n2001; Keskitalo 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1 \u2013 Schematic representation of paper-ink interaction. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2 represents a typical wetting system consisting of a liquid drop on a solid surface. \n\nIn such systems, the most important measurable characteristic is the contact angle,? , which \n\nresults of the equilibrium between the adhesive (?SL) and cohesive (?L and ?S) forces \n\ninvolved.

T. Moutinho 81 \n\nWhen the equilibrium between the liquid and the solid is establishes, the balance of forces of \n\nthe system at the contact point between the three phases (Figure 6.2) can be described by \n\nthe well known Young equation: \n\n???? cos?+= LSLS                                                                                                   (6.1) \n\nwhere S?  is the surface free energy of the solid, SL?  is the interfacial free energy between \n\nthe liquid and the solid, L?  is the surface tension of the liquid, and ?  is the contact angle. \n\nThe new interface formed by the contact between the liquid and the solid surface is \n\ncharacterized by a given energy that would be the one needed to remove the liquid drop \n\nfrom the surface; this energy is called the work of adhesion (Wa ), and is computed by (Brigs \n\net al. 1989):   \n\nSLLSWa ??? ?+=                                                                                                     (6.2) \n\nBy combining Equations 6.1 and 6.2 the so called Young-Dupre equation is obtained, which \n\nrelates the work of adhesion with the contact angle value: \n\n)cos1( ?? +?= LWa                                                                                                    (6.3) \n\nThese relations, based on force balances and thermodynamic definitions, are applicable to \n\nthe interactions occurring in any solid-liquid system and several theories have been \n\ndeveloped to use them in order to calculate the surface properties of solids, namely the \n\nsurface free energy, ?S. \n\n \n\n6.1.2 SURFACE ENERGY CALCULATION THEORIES \n\nThe most used theories to determine the surface energy of solids from contact angle data \n\nusing liquids whose surface tensions are known, are those of Zisman (1960\u2019s); Owens, Wendt, \n\nRabel and Kaelbe (OWRK) (1960\u2019s); Fowkes (1950\u00b4s) and of van Oss &amp; Good (1980\u00b4s) \n\n(Gennes 1985; Brigs et al. 1989; Keskitalo 2000; Levlin and S\u00f6derhjelm 2000; Marmur \n\n2006) \n\n \n\n6.1.2.1 Zisman \n\nIn this theory, at least two liquids with known surface tensions are used and the cosines of the \n\nmeasured contact angles are plotted versus the surface tension of the corresponding liquid.  \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M. T. Moutinho 82 \n\nThe straight line obtained is then extrapolated to a value of cosine=1 (?=0\u00ba). The \n\nextrapolated value is called the critical surface tension ( C? ), and corresponds to complete \n\nwetting (?=0).  \n\nThe Young equation (6.1) then comes: \n\nCSLS ??? +=                                                                                                              (6.4) \n\nwhen 0=SL? , SC ?? =  and thus the critical surface tension equals the solid surface energy. \n\nThis method is of limited use since the linear relationship only applies when the relationship \n\nbetween the dispersive and the polar interactions is the same in the solid and in the liquid. \n\nThis practically only occurs under exceptional circumstances as when purely dispersive \n\ninteractive solids and liquids are involved (eg. non-polar solids as polymers as polyethylene \n\nand Polytetrafluoroethylene).  \n\n \n\n6.1.2.2 Owens, Wendt, Rabel and Kaelble  \n\nThis theory distinguishes the dispersive and polar components of the surface energy, which \n\nare considered independent and additive for all the constituents of the system: \n\nPD ??? +=                                                                                                              (6.5) \n\nThus, for a liquid: \n\nP\nL\n\nD\nLL ??? +=                                                                                                             (6.6) \n\nwhere ?L is the liquid surface tension, ?LD is the dispersive component of the liquid surface \n\ntension and ?LP is the polar component of the liquid surface tension. \n\n Similarly, for the solid: \n\nP\nS\n\nD\nSS ??? +=                                                                                                            (6.7) \n\nIn this theory the polar interactions include Coulomb interactions between permanent and \n\ninduced dipoles.  \n\nAs for the work of adhesion, this theory also considers the addition of a dispersive and a \n\npolar component: \n\nPD WaWaWa +=                                                                                                        (6.8) \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

The former two methods are not \n\ncommonly used, mainly because they are indirect methods (Koljonen and Stenius 2005; \n\nGurau et al. 2006).  \n\nThe sessile drop method is an optical contact angle method, which involves directly measuring \n\nthe contact angle for a drop of liquid resting on a horizontal solid surface (Figure 6.2). \n\nTraditionally, the measurement of the contact angles was carried out using a goniometer \n\neyepiece, being the results quite operator dependent. Nowadays, the measurement is \n\nperformed through video based systems. Sophisticated CCD cameras are used to capture the \n\ndrop image which is stored and subsequently analyzed by the equipment software.  \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M. T. Moutinho 86 \n\nGreat care is however necessary in the position of the base line (phase boundary \n\nsolid/liquid) and of the drop contour line. For the latter, different functions can be used, \n\ndepending upon the software and the computing time available, as described in the next \n\nsection. The test liquids to be used must be free from evaporation during the measurements \n\nand should correspond to a large range of polar and dispersive components. Table 6.2 lists \n\nthe five test liquids selected for this study (diodomethane, propileneglycol, ethileneglycol, \n\nformamide and water), as well as their surface tensions and corresponding dispersive and \n\npolar components. \n\n \n\nTable 6.2 \u2013 Properties of the test liquids used in this work. \n\nSurface Tension (mN/m) \nLiquid \n\nTotal Dispersive Component Polar Component \nDiodomethane 50.80 50.80 0.00 \nPropileneglycol 35.40 26.40 9.00 \nEthileneglycol 48.28 30.93 17.35 \nFormamide 58.13 32.28 25.85 \nWater 72.78 24.73 48.05 \n\n \n\n6.1.3.1 Equipment \u2013 OCA 20 \n\nThe equipment used for the contact angle measurements was the model OCA 20 from \n\nDataphysics, which can also be used for liquids surface tension measurements. \n\nThis equipment, depicted in Figure 6.4, is mainly composed of a light source, a sample \n\nholder, a dispense system and a CCD camera for image acquisition.  Besides the calculations, \n\nthe software coupled to the equipment, allows the user to control the dispense mechanism \n\nand the image acquisition (picture or video).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

T. Moutinho 88 \n\nRegarding image acquisition, the static contact angle measurement is based on a digital \n\nimage, captured by the CCD camera, of the resting drop immediately after contact with the \n\nsolid surface (normally corresponding to a time interval inferior to 3 sec), whereas, for the \n\ndynamic contact angle, successive images of the liquid drop are acquired during 180 sec \n\nwith a velocity of 2 frames/sec.  \n\nFor the static contact angle measurements, at least 10 drops of each of the five test liquids \n\n(Table 7.2) were used, using at least two stripes of paper from two different sheets, cut in \n\nthe diagonal direction in order to avoid any possible effect of fiber orientation. This \n\nprocedure was repeated for each of the 30 samples. The surface free energy of each \n\nsamples was computed from the average contact angle values (standard deviation of the \n\nmeasurements &lt;2\u00ba). While for the dynamic contact angle measurements, at least three drops \n\nwere analyzed (water was the test liquid for these measurements), also using at least two \n\nstripes of paper from two different sheets, cut in the diagonal direction in order to avoid any \n\npossible effect of fiber orientation and it was ensured the reproducibility of the results \n\nbetween tests, by verifying that the same behavior was observed. \n\nThe contact angle calculations depend on the accuracy of the baseline of the drop, \n\ncorresponding to the solid/liquid interface, as well on the drop profile (liquid/air interface). \n\nDistinct mathematical methods are available for fitting the drop contour, resulting in different \n\naccuracies and computational times: the height/width method, the Ellipse method and the \n\nLaplace-Young method. In the height/width method a segment of circle is fitted to the drop \n\nshape, but for large drops leads to considerable errors and thus it is of limited use.  In the \n\nellipse method, the drop contour is approximated by an ellipse whereas in the Laplace-\n\nYoung method a line is fitted exactly to the drop contour which requires a longer \n\ncomputational time. The ellipse method is thus slightly less accurate but faster, being selected \n\nwhen a rapid calculation is necessary (fast absorption by the solid or dynamic contact angle \n\nmeasurements). \n\nBesides the calculation of the contact angle values and corresponding errors associated to \n\nthe measurement, the equipment software also enables the computation of other drop \n\nproperties such as the drop volume, drop base diameter and drop age (associating a time to \n\neach contact angle value in the dynamic measurements). \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T.

This influence results from the fact that, within a measured (geometric) unit area on a \n\nrough surface, the real surface is actually larger and consequently the intensity of the surface \n\nenergy is greater than in the same (geometric) unit area of a smooth surface. Thus, between \n\none liquid and one solid surface with some degree o roughness, two values of the contact \n\nangle are assigned: the apparent contact angle,? , experimentally determined, and the real \n\ncontact angle, '? , derived from Young equation. \n\nReported results show that high surface roughness increases large contact angles (> 90\u00ba) and \n\ndecreases small contact angles (&lt;90\u00ba), as schematically represented in Figure 6.5 (Levlin \n\nand S\u00f6derhjelm 2000; Bico at al. 2002; Marmur 2006). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.5 \u2013 Schematic representation of the surface roughness influence in contact angle values. \n\n \n\nThe earliest works on the effect of surface roughness on the contact angle measurement are \n\nattributed to Wenzel (Wenzel 1936; Wenzel 1949) and to Cassei and Baxter (Cassei and \n\nBaxter 1944; Cassei 1948), who provided different expressions for correcting apparent \n\ncontact angles, based on different average parameters of a rough surface.  \n\nCassei and Baxter assumed that the liquid forms a composite surface on the rough surface, \n\nnot filling the grooves, as illustrated in Figure 6.6. In this case, the contact area includes a \n\nliquid-solid interface and a liquid-air interface (Lai 2003). \n\n \n\n \n\n90\u00ba \n\nContact Angle \n\nSurface Roughness \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

(Figure 6.6), the apparent contact angle, \n\naccording to Cassei, C?  , is  expressed by: \n\n21 coscoscos YaYsC ????? ?+?=                                                                                 (6.19) \n\nApplying this equation to a rough surface trapping air in the hollows, leads to \n\n( ) 1cos\u00ba180cos1coscos\n11\n\n?+?=??+?= sYssYsC ???????                                             (6.20) \n\nThe Wenzel approach assumes that the liquid fills up the grooves of the rough surface \n\n(Figure 6.7) and considers that for an identically same increase in the free liquid area at the \n\nupper surface of the drop (liquid-air interface), a greater amount of actual surface is wetted \n\nunder the drop in a rough surface when compared to a smooth surface (Lai 2003).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.7 - Schematic representation of a drop on a rough surface according to Wenzel. \n\n \n\nTherefore, according to Wenzel, a distinction must be made between the total (or actual) \n\nsurface and the superficial (or geometrical) surface. Four that a \u201croughness factor\u201d, R*, \n\ncorresponding to the ratio between the actual surface and the geometric surface, is used in \n\nthe following relation between the apparent ( )?  and the real or Young contact angle ( '? ) : \n\n'cos*cos ?? ?= R                                                                                                      (6.21) \n\n????Y1 \n????Y2 \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 91 \n\nIn the present work, the Wenzel correction was selected to account for the influence of \n\ntopography on the contact angle measurements for the following reasons: i) the material \n\nunder study is paper, typically hydrophilic in nature, and thus the approach  of Wenzel \n\n(Figure 6.7) seems a more realistic assumption; ii) the correction factor R* is easier  and more \n\naccurately determined than the surface fraction s?  defined in the Cassie correction (Swain \n\n1998; W\u00e5gberg and Westerlind 2000; Bico et al. 2002; Lai 2003; Marmur 2006). \n\nThus, the contact angle experimentally measured will be corrected using Equation 6.22 with \n\nthe topographical correction factor R given by: \n\n100\n1*\n\nSdr\nR +=                                                                                                            (6.22) \n\nhere Sdr is the interfacial area ratio obtained by profilometry, as previously defined in \n\nSection 4.1.1.3 \n\n \n\n6.1.5 DYNAMIC PARAMETERS \n\nBesides the measurement of the contact angle as a function of time, the software used also \n\nprovides the values of the drop base diameter and of the drop volume.

Moutinho 92 \n\n6.2 RESULTS \n\nThe results obtained for the contact angles measured with the selected liquids, using the \n\nabove described equipment, will be fully analyzed in this section.  \n\nSince inkjet inks are water based, the results obtained for the initial contact angle (known as \n\nstatic contact angle) with water are of special relevance to evaluate printing performance. \n\nNevertheless, the data collected for the five liquids will be used to determine the surface \n\nenergy and its components. The influence of the various synthetic surface sizing agents as \n\nwell as of their different proportions will also be discussed. Finally, to complement the results, \n\nthe evaluation of the contact angles variation throughout time (dynamic contact angle) will be \n\nexamined. \n\nSimilarly to the procedure adopted in previous chapters, the results were firstly analyzed by \n\nANOVA, in order to evaluate the statistical significance of their variability. The results of this \n\nanalysis are presented in Table 6.4. \n\n \n\nTable 6.4 \u2013 ANOVA of the contact angle results. \n\nContribution for the total \nvariation (%) \n\nVariables  \n(Contact Angles)* \n\nInter-Samples Intra-Samples \n\nReproducibility \nFactor (r) \n\n(\u00ba)  \nP F Fcritical \n\nDiodomethane  96.81 3.19 3.57 3.5E-263 382.95 1.49 \nPropileneglycol  97.82 2.18 4.06 7.2E-223 434.52 1.50 \nEthileneglycol  98.59 1.41 3.75 1.7E-276 743.27 1.49 \nFormamide  98.93 1.07 3.69 0.0E+00 1029.46 1.49 \nWater  98.88 1.12 4.01 0.0E+00 1099.36 1.49 \n\n \n\nFrom Table 6.4 table, it is possible to observe that, for all the liquids used, the contribution of \n\nthe inter-sample differences is much higher than that corresponding to intra-sample variation. \n\nThis indicates that the differences induced by distinct sizing agents in the various sample \n\nsurfaces are statistically valid. Table 6.4 also shows that the quality of the statistical analysis \n\nis high as denoted by the extremely low value of P and by the fact of F being much larger \n\nthan Fcritical. Additionally, the values of the reproducibility factor (r) indicate that, for any \n\nliquid, differences larger than 4\u00ba in the contact angle values are statistically significant.  \n\nHaving demonstrated the validity of the differences between samples, the next step is to \n\nanalyze the effect of sample topography on the contact angle values. \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

The values of R* determined for each sample are compiled in Table 6.5.

These observations are equally valid for the other liquids \n\ntested (propileneglycol, ethileneghycol and formamide), being the corresponding graphics \n\npresented in Appendix E. \n\nThe above figures lead to the conclusion that the sample roughness only slightly affects the \n\nmeasurements of the contact angle and consequently the derived parameters as total surface \n\nenergy and its components. Since good correlations between corrected and uncorrected \n\nvalues were obtained, it can be stated that the above corrections will not alter any conclusion \n\nundertaken from raw data in studies where the Sdr measurement is not possible to allow the \n\ncorrection. \n\n \n\n6.2.2 STATIC CONTACT ANGLES \n\nAs mentioned before, the static contact angles correspond to the initial wetting measurements \n\nwhich are taken for times approximately equal to 3 seconds from the contact of the drop \n\nwith the sample surface. This time was found to correspond to the average time interval \n\nnecessary for the system to reach equilibrium. Figure 6.9 illustrates, as an example, the \n\nwater contact angle values measured for the samples sized with the lowest amount (i.e. 5%) \n\nof surface sizing agent. This figure shows that all sized papers are wetted (contact angles \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

In fact, cationic starch has a hydrophilic nature and thus the reduced \n\nvalues of the contact angle with water (&lt;40 \u00ba) are perfectly natural. The increase in paper \n\nsurface hydrophobicity as a result of adding the sizing agents was also expected regarding \n\nthe copolymers composition (Section 3.1).  \n\n30\n35\n40\n45\n50\n55\n60\n65\n70\n75\n80\n\nS\nt\n\nS\ntS\n\n1\n-0\n\n5\n\nS\ntS\n\n2\n-0\n\n5\n\nS\ntS\n\n3\n-0\n\n5\n\nS\ntS\n\n4\n-0\n\n5\n\nS\ntS\n\n5\n-0\n\n5\n\nS\ntS\n\n6\n-0\n\n5\n\nS\ntS\n\n7\n-0\n\n5\n\nS\ntS\n\n8\n-0\n\n5\n\nS\ntS\n\n9\n-0\n\n5\n\nS\ntS\n\n1\n0\n-0\n\n5\n\nSample\n\nW\nat\n\ner\n c\n\no\nn\n\nta\nct\n\n a\nn\n\ng\nle\n\n (\n\u00ba)\n\n \n\nFigure 6.9 - Contact angle values with water, measured for the reference samples and the samples sized with \n\nthe addition of 5% of synthetic surface sizing agent. \n\n \n\nNonetheless, it is evident that some samples exhibit values close to that of the reference \n\nsample (e. g. StS3 and StS9) whereas others present values close to the hydrophobicity \n\nbarrier (e.g. StS4-05). The latter are, in principle, not favorable for printing performance \n\nwith based water inks. However, it is important to stress that the final printing quality is the \n\nresult of the balance of a set of properties and can not be predicted only by the analysis of \n\nthe contact angle measured for water. \n\nA detailed explanation of these differences will be given when discussing the results \n\nobtained for the surface energies and its components since these are the parameters that \n\nindeed condition the values of the contact angle.

T. Moutinho 97 \n\nThis sequence was somehow expected since the polarity of the liquids tested decreases in the \n\nsame way (water is the most polar whereas diodomethane is non-polar), and the size agents \n\nare mainly non-polar compounds. \n\nHowever, there is one sizing agent, agent S5 (quaternary ditallow methyl epoxypropyl \n\nammonium), that presents a unique behavior:  as the polarity of the liquid decreases, the \n\ncontact angle consistently increases (reaching a remarkably high contact angle value, \n\nrelatively to the others, for the diodomethane).  This indicates that this surface sizing agent \n\nhas a much larger influence on the surface properties ruling the dispersive interactions than \n\non those ruling the polar interactions. \n\nWith regard to the effect of increasing the amount of copolymer (5, 10 and 20 %), all types \n\nof tendencies can be observed, as illustrated in Figure 6.10: the contact angle increases with \n\nthe amount of the sizing agent, the contact angle decreases as the amount of the sizing agent \n\nincreases or, an inflexion point is detected.  \n\nThe reason why the increase of the surface sizing concentration originates these distinct types \n\nof variation is probably related with the arrangement of the copolymers molecules at the \n\nsample surface, i.e., molecule orientation and the availability of their functional groups for \n\ninteracting with the various liquids. This point will be discussed in the next section, together \n\nwith the results of the surface energies.    \n\n \n\n6.2.3 SURFACE ENERGIES \n\nSurface free energy and the corresponding dispersive and polar components were \n\ndetermined, according to OWRK method, as describe in Section 6.1.3.

Since the major effect of the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents is \n\ndetected in the polar component of the surface energy, the values of this component will be \n\nanalyzed in more detail in Figure 6.13, regarding the influence of the amount of the sizing \n\nagent.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.13 \u2013 Polar component of the surface free energy for all the samples tested.  \n\n \n\nAs Figure 6.13 shows, the addition of the various synthetic agents significantly reduces the \n\npolar component of the surface energy, from 20 to 95 %, depending on the type of \n\ncompound as well as its amount. Concerning the concentration of the sizing agent, and \n\nsimilarly to Figure 6.10, all types of behaviors are observed, being the most common the \n\nexistence of an inflection point for the intermediate quantity of the surface sizing agent. As \n\nmentioned above, this might be a consequence of the distinct molecular orientations of these \n\nagents at the surface of the paper samples.  \n\nFor instance, samples StS2 and StS8 (that include co-styrene-maleic anhydride and co-\n\nstyrene-butyl acrylate, respectively) present a consistent decrease in the values of the polar \n\ncomponent with the sizing agent concentration, suggesting that the molecules of these co-\n\npolymers are oriented at the paper surface with the styrene monomer towards the exterior. \n\nOn the contrary, the oxygen containing monomers are pointing inwards, i.e. towards the \n\nfibrous matrix, probably as result of some attraction from the -OH groups of cellulose. \n\nHowever, when the copolymer concentration is increased from 10 to 20 %, the decrease in \n\nthe polar component is much more attenuated for surface sizing agent S8 (co-styrene-butyl \n\nacrylate). This may be because, for the intermediate concentration, their molecules (larger \n\nthan the ones of co-styrene-maleic anhydride) nearly fill the available sites. Presumably if \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 101 \n\nthe amount of this sizing agent would be further increased, the molecules would re-orient and \n\nthe polar component would again increase. \n\nThis is probably what happened with samples St S3 and StS9 whose polar components \n\nexhibit a minimum for 10 % incorporation. Regarding the surface sizing agent S3 (co-\n\nacrylonitrile-acrylate), for the lowest concentration (5 %), the less polar nitrile group is most \n\nlikely oriented outwards. As concentration increases (to 10 %), all the available sites are \n\nnearly filled. A further increase in concentration leads not only to the accumulation of the \n\nmolecules but also to their reorientation. The affinity of their functional groups makes that the \n\nacrylate group (more polar) reorient outwards leading to an increase in the polar character \n\nof the surface. A similar explanation can be advanced for the sizing agent S9 (co-styrene-\n\nacrylate): initially the styrene monomer is the one oriented outwards but the increase of the \n\nco-polymer amount after saturation of the available sites originates a re-orientation of the \n\nmolecule and ultimately a new increase of the polar component. However, in this case, the \n\npolar component variations are more pronounced than those found for sample StS3, most \n\ncertainly because the molecule of compound S9 is larger. \n\nSimilar justifications can be produced for the behaviors detected for the remaining surface \n\nsizing agents, being the only difference the critical amount needed to change the molecules \n\norientation. This amount is probably related to the particle size of the copolymer, as \n\nmentioned above, but might also be related to other factors such as, the penetration of the \n\nsurface sizing agent or the surface tension of the liquids.  \n\nSince, as Figure 6.12 indicates, the major impact of the surface sizing agents on surface \n\nenergetics seems to be derived from contribution of the polar component,  the contact angle \n\nwas plotted as a function of the surface free energy the ( PS? ). Figure 6.14 shows the \n\nrelationship obtained with water while Table 6.6 gathers the results achieved for the \n\nremaining liquids tested. \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

The ultimate purpose of this study is to anticipate \n\nthe final printing performance. The measurement of the dynamic contact angle corresponds \n\nto the analysis of successive pictures captured by the CCD camera approximately every 0.5 \n\nsec., during 180 seconds.  \n\nAs mentioned before, water was the test liquid chosen for this type of study, not only \n\nbecause it is the liquid currently used for most wetting evaluations but also because the \n\nprinting technology that will be further applied to evaluate print quality is inkjet, which uses \n\nwater based inks. \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

However, it should be stressed that, \n\nregarding the wetting velocity, it is not easily obvious which values should be considered \n\n\u201clarge\u201d or \u201csmall\u201d, since the optimum wetting velocity value for a given paper also depends \n\nupon absorption and spreading phenomena. Concerning P&amp;W papers it is usually accepted \n\nthat relatively small wetting velocities are beneficial for inkjet printing performance, if \n\naccompanied with a predominance of absorption over spreading. However, small wetting \n\nvalues do not necessarily mean better printing performances. In fact, very small wetting \n\nvelocities may indicate that the paper has no capacity to absorb the ink solvent, leading to \n\nbad printing performance.  \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

However, this decrease can \n\nnot be analyzed independently of the evaluation of the drop base diameter and volume, as \n\nexplained before. \n\nThe profiles determined for each sample, regarding the normalized contact angle, drop \n\nbase diameter and drop volume, presented in Appendix E, show that in general the addition \n\nof a synthetic surface sizing agent does not originate that unusual increase in drop diameter. \n\nMoreover, no significant swelling was observed for any of these samples. This is valid either \n\nfor wetting velocities larger and smaller than that of the standard sample (0.23\u00ba/sec). It can \n\nthen be concluded that the sizing agents positively influence the wetting process. Figure 6.17 \n\nshows a typical result, obtained for sample StS4-05, that exhibits a wetting velocity similar \n\nto that of the reference sample (0.27\u00ba/sec).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.17 \u2013 Normalized contact angle and normalized drop volume for sample StS4-05. \n\n \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M. T. Moutinho 108 \n\nIn this figure, a gradual decrease of both the normalized contact angle and the drop volume \n\ncan be noticed. Additionally, no swelling effects were observed at the paper surface. Similar \n\nfindings were detected for the majority of the samples, confirming that the synthetic surface \n\nsizing agents have a controlling action over the dynamics of the wetting phenomenon. \n\nThe influence of the concentration of the sizing agent will be studied by analyzing the \n\ndynamic contact angle profiles of different samples.  \n\nLet us take, for example, the case of the sizing agent S2, co-styrene-maleic anhydride. The \n\ngraphic of Figure 6.13 indicates that the polar component of the surface free energy \n\ndecreases as the incorporation percentage of S2 increases. As explained, this is probably \n\nbecause the styrene molecules are always turned outwards, that is, oriented towards the air \n\ninterface. The results achieved for the dynamic contact angle measurements are also in \n\nagreement with this assumption, since an increase in the copolymer amount also results in a \n\nprogressively lower wetting velocity: 0.20, 0.10 and 0.04\u00ba/sec, respectively for 5%, 10% \n\nand 20 % of S2.  \n\nThe normalized contact angle as a function of time is plotted in Figure 6.18. From this plot, it \n\nis evident that the higher the percentage of S2 the slower is the profile slope. Nonetheless, \n\nfor the first few seconds, the distinction between the curves is not so obvious. \n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210\n\nTime (sec)\n\nN\no\n\nrm\nal\n\niz\ned\n\n C\no\n\nn\nta\n\nct\n A\n\nn\ng\n\nle\n\nStS2-05 StS2-10 StS2-20\n\n \n\nFigure 6.18 \u2013 Normalized contact angle for samples sized with the synthetic surface sizing agent S2. \n\n \n\nThe decrease in the contact angle measured with water when only 5% of S2 is added results \n\nfrom the fact that the hydrophobicity of the styrene is not enough to maintain the value of the \n\ninitial contact angle. Thus, after the initial wetting, the oxygen atoms of the maleic anhydride \n\nmonomer are accessible to the water drop, originating the profile of Figure 6.18 for this \n\nconcentration.

However, and as mentioned before, the analysis of the dynamic \n\ncontact angle should not be made independently of the drop behavior in terms of drop base \n\ndiameter (spreading) and drop volume (absorption). These results are presented in Figure \n\n6.19  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.19 \u2013 Normalized drop base diameter and drop volume for the samples sized with the synthetic \n\nsurface sizing agent S2. \n\n \n\nAs this figure shows, the decrease in the wetting velocity of sample StS2-05 is found to be \n\ndue to high absorption, indicating that the addition of 5% of sizing agent is not sufficient to \n\ndecrease that absorption. On the contrary, the addition of 20% of S2 seems excessive, since \n\nthe absorption is negligible and thus almost no contact angle variation is detected. The \n\noptimum sizing amount for this surface sizing agent seems to be above 5% and below 20%. \n\nSince the sizing agent S2 is similar in composition to sizing agent S4 (the main difference \n\nbeing the monomers ratio styrene/maleic anhydride that is 3/1 in the case of S2 and 2/1 in \n\nthe case of S4, (Table 3.2), it was found interesting to compare the dynamic performance of \n\nthese two copolymers. Figure 6.20 illustrates the variation of contact angle for the three \n\nconcentrations tested (5, 10 and 20%) of both styrene-maleic anhydride copolymers. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

For 20% of incorporation, the contact angle \n\nvariation is caused almost only by absorption. This suggests that, most probably, the sample \n\nStS4-20 will be the one with better inkjet printing performance among these.  \n\nFigure 6.22 and Figure 6.23 illustrate the dynamic behavior of the samples sized with the \n\nsizing agent S9 that also contains styrene (co-styrene-acrylate, Table 3.2). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.22 - Normalized contact angle for samples sized with the synthetic surface sizing agent S9. \n\n \n\nFigure 6.23 - Normalized drop base diameter and drop volume for the samples sized with the synthetic \n\nsurface sizing agent S9. \n\n \n\nThe analysis of the surface energy results (Section 6.2.3) suggested that, for 5 and 10% of \n\nincorporation of this sizing agent, the styrene groups are the ones oriented outwards. \n\nHowever, at 20% of incorporation, a re-orientation of the molecule takes place and the \n\nacrylate groups are the ones facing the air interface.

Interestingly, as Table \n\n6.9 reports, the highest values of the wetting velocity, 0.21\u00ba/sec, were achieved for the \n\nsamples StS1-05 and StS9-20. \n\nThis indicates that the accessibility of the OH groups does not change significantly with the \n\nincrease of the incorporation percentage, and thus the wetting velocity and the contact angle \n\nvariation decrease with the sizing agent increase. \n\nIn the particular case of the 5% incorporation, the difference detected between the profiles \n\nof the samples containing S9 and S1 can be associated to the fact that the molecules of \n\nstyrene, being more close together in the sizing agent S1 Figure 3.3, and its effect is thus less \n\nnoted when a small amount is used. \n\nIdentical analyses can be made for other samples.

Inverse gas chromatography (IGC) uses this fact to study of the stationary \n\nphase instead of the mobile phase: by using a series of solutes (probes) of well known \n\nphysicochemical characteristics, it is possible to extract valuable information about the \n\npacking material of the column.  (Figure 7.1) (Gutierrez et al. 1999; Kunaver et al. 2004; \n\nCarvalho et al. 2005; Santos and Guthrie 2005; Wang and Sain 2007). \n\nFigure 7.1 \u2013 Schematic representation of conventional gas chromatography (GC) and inverse gas \n\nchromatography (IGC) analysis. \n\n \n\nAfter the introduction of IGC in 1967, the application of this technique has grown rapidly, \n\nbeing frequently used for the surface characterization of organic and inorganic materials \n\nsuch as polymers, industrial fibers, wood and pulp fibers, composites, coatings, pigments, \n\ncatalysts as well as particles, glass beads or chemicals. The quantity of related publications \n\nhas been permanently increasing, covering applications in many fields, like pharmaceutical, \n\nceramics, constructions, pulp and paper or transports (Pyda et al. 1993; Cordeiro et al. \n\nInjected Material \n\nStandard Analytical Packing \n(Known Properties) \n\nSeparated Peaks \n\nTr1 Tr2 \n\nConventional Gas Chromatography \n\nInjected Probes \n\n(Known Properties) \n\nPacked Sample \n(Unknown Properties) \n\nSingle Peak \n\nTr1 \n\nInverse Gas Chromatography \n\n(Unknown Properties) \n\n\n\nPhysical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n  Isabel M.

Due to the interactions between the \n\nstationary and the mobile phase, the probe molecules are retained for a certain time (tr), \n\nknown as the retention time, which is used to calculate the net retention volume (Vn), \n\naccording to:  \n\nJFttVn r ???= )( 0                                                                                                     (7.1) \n\nwhere t0 is the dead retention time of a marker probe, F is the carrier gas flow rate and J is \n\nthe correction factor for gas compressibility, calculated according to Equation 7.2: \n\n1\n\n1\n\n5.1\n3\n\n0\n\n2\n\n0\n\n???\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n\n???\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n\n=\n\nP\n\nP\n\nP\n\nP\n\nJ\ni\n\ni\n\n                                                                                                       (7.2) \n\nPi and P0 are the inlet and outlet pressures of the carrier gas, respectively. \n\nTaking into account the fact of the experiments being undertaken at infinite dilution \n\nconditions, the free energy of adsorption of the probes on the stationary phase surface per \n\nmole (?G) can be determined from the retention volume (Vn) according to Equation 7.3: \n\n1)ln( CVnTRG +??=??                                                                                              (7.3) \n\nwhere R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute column temperature and C1 is a constant \n\nwhich depends upon the chromatographic column. \n\nConsidering that the dispersive and specific components, ?GD and ?GS, respectively, are \n\nadditive (Equation 7.4), as suggested by Fowkes in 1987, Equation 7.3 can be rewritten as:  \n\nSD GGG ?+?=?

(7.5) \n\nOn the other hand, the free energy of adsorption can also be related to the work of \n\nadhesion (Wa) according to Equation 7.6: \n\nWaaNG ??=??

Equations 7.3 and 7.6 can then be combined so that: \n\n)ln()()(2 2\n1\n\n2\n1\n\nVnTRCaN DL\nD\nS ??=+???? ??                                                                  (7.10) \n\nBy plotting R\u00b7T\u00b7ln(Vn) vs 2\u00b7N\u00b7a\u00b7(?LD)1/2 for a homologous alkane series (Figure 7.2), a straight \n\nline is obtained usually referred to as the reference line.

This approach has been \n\nlater supported by experimental results. \n\nThe acid-base interactions are analyzed through the net retention volume measured using \n\npolar probes. In order to obtain the acidic (Ka) and the basic (Kb) parameters of the solid \n\nsurface, the vertical deviations from the reference line for each polar probe, are quantified, \n\nallowing the estimation of the specific component of free energy (?GS) as: \n\n)ln()ln( Re f\nS VnTRVnpTRG ?????=??                                                                       (7.11) \n\nwhere Vn,Ref is the retention volume established by the n-alkanes reference line, and Vnp is the \n\nretention volume of the polar probes.  The adhesion work between the polar probes tested \n\nand the paper samples (Was) can be obtained from the specific free energy (Eq.7.6) as: \n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n=\nf\n\ns\na\n\nVn\n\nVnp\n\naN\n\nTR\nW\n\nRe\n\nln                                                                                               (7.12) \n\nIn order to relate these concepts with the acid-base interactions, which according to Fowkes \n\ncan be considered as the origin of all specific interactions, it is necessary to make use of the \n\nfollowing thermodynamic definitions: \n\nABABAB STHG ????=?

Similar experimental procedures have also been \n\nadopted by other authors (Cordeiro et al. 1995; Shen et al. 1998; Santos et al. 2001; \n\nCarvalho et al. 2005; Santos and Guthrie 2005).  \n\n \n\nFigure 7.6 \u2013Preparation of samples for IGC measurements: (a) pieces of a paper sample prepared to be \n\npacked into the IGC column; (b) Experimental assembly used for packing the columns; (c) ICG column packed \n\nand folded, ready to be introduced into the equipment. \n\n \n\nThe experiments were carried out at temperatures between 35 and 60\u00baC using 5\u00baC steps. \n\nThis temperature range was selected since it was not possible to operate the equipment \n\nbelow 35\u00baC, and above 60\u00baC, there was the risk of damaging the paper surface by a \n\nprolonged exposure to such high temperatures. The injector and detector were set at 180 \n\nand 200\u00baC respectively, in order to keep an adequate temperature difference (a minimum \n\ndifference of 20\u00baC between the injector and detector is desirable) and simultaneously to \n\nmaintain both temperatures higher that the maximum vaporization temperature of the \n\nprobes. Helium was used as carrier gas and to each sample tested the flow was selected to \n\nensure that neither absorption nor diffusion of the probes would occur inside the column \n\n(preliminary tests were undertaken for this purpose). Small amounts of each probe vapor (<1 \n\n\u00b5l) were injected into the carrier gas flow to ensure that the experiments were carried out at \n\ninfinite dilution. \n\nThe retention times were determined by measuring the electrical signal with a Flame \n\nIonization Detector (FID) located at the end of the IGC column. \n\n(a)                                                   (b)                                                      (c) \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

The calculations and subsequent analysis presented in \n\nthis chapter correspond to average values of the retention time of each pair probe/sample. \n\nFirst of all, the analysis will be focused on the retention time values, in order to detect \n\ngeneric tendencies and behaviors.

Although the corresponding results are presented in Appendix F (due \n\nto the large quantity of data), sorted by probe and temperature, it should be pointed out \n\nthat the quality of the statistical analysis is ensured by the values of the parameters P, F and \n\nFcritical (P values between 1.32E-64 and 1.08E-06 and F values much higher than the ones of \n\nFcritical in all cases).

This is in agreement with results previously reported by other authors, \n\nregarding pulp and paper studies (Shen et al. 1996; Santos et al. 2001; Carvalho et al. \n\n2005). This decrease with temperature is associated to an entropic contribution of the surface \n\nfree energy.  \n\nAlso regarding the magnitude of the ?SD values, it should be stressed that similar values can \n\nbe found in previously published studies, which reported  ?SD values of 24.6 mN/m  at 50\u00baC \n\nfor an office paper, and 33.4 mN/m at 40\u00baC for handsheets of Eucalyptus globulus pulp \n\n(Santos et al. 2001; Carvalho et al. 2005). \n\nThe quality of the linear correlation between ?SD and T is very good for all the samples (with \n\nthe exception of sample StS1-05), as summarized in Table 7.2.

The same was detected in the contact angle measurements, as \n\nreported in Chapter 6. \n\nThis indicates that the sizing agent generally increases the surface ability to establish \n\ndispersive interactions, probably due to the higher surface tension of the sizing agents \n\ncompared to that of the cationic starch (Table 3.3).  \n\nHowever, in addition to the surface tension effect, the size and the spatial orientation of the \n\nmolecules of sizing agents at the paper surface can also influence its ability to establish \n\ndispersive interactions.  \n\nConcerning the influence of the type and of the concentration of the sizing agent, different \n\nbehaviors were detected. Let us examine for instance the results of Figure 7.16 that shows \n\nthe variation of ?SD with the concentration of the sizing agent S2 (co-styrene-maleic \n\nanhydride), together with value of the reference sample, for different temperatures. Besides \n\na consistent decrease of ?SD with temperature, it is visible that the relative position \n\ncorresponding to the three incorporation percentages is maintained between 35 \u00baC and \n\n45\u00baC, but above this temperature, quite distinct behaviors can be observed. A dissimilar \n\nbehavior was detected for the synthetic surface sizing agent S4 (co-styrene-maleic \n\nanhydride) which shows a different behavior for each of the temperatures tested. In fact \n\nthese are just examples of the myriad of patterns found for the various sizing agents. \n\nThis is most certainly a consequence of the dispersive interactions being weak by nature, and \n\nthus significantly affected by the vibrational movement of the molecules caused by the \n\ntemperature.  In fact the increase in temperature was found to alter the impact of the \n\nmolecules size and spatial orientation of the molecules on the intensity of the dispersive \n\nforces (in particular when the molecules are non linear).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nPhysical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n  Isabel M.

Thus to compare the values of ?SD determined by IGC \n\nwith those derived from the contact angle measurements,  the former have to be \n\nextrapolated to 21\u00baC.The extrapolated values are calculated using the correlations \n\npresented in Table 7.2, being the comparison presented in Figure 7.17. \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

Moutinho 135 \n\nFigure 7.17 \u2013 Comparison of the ?SD values calculated from the contact angle measurements and from the \n\nextrapolation of the IGC data (based on the correlations of Table 7.2). \n\n \n\nAs this figure clearly shows, the values of the dispersive component of the surface energy \n\nderived from IGC are always superior to those derived from the contact angle \n\nmeasurements.  \n\nThis superiority (mostly between 10 and 20%, but reaching in some cases 40%) is not \n\nsurprising since the n-alkanes used in the IGC technique to perform the experiments are very \n\nstable molecules and are transported in very low concentrations within the inert gas, thus \n\ninducing the predominant detection of high energy sites which in turn leads to higher values \n\nof ?SD. Conversely, the contact angle method detects surface sites of all energy levels, \n\ncomputing an average energy level of the surface (Kwok et al. 1998; Shen et al. 2000). This \n\nalso leads to higher amplitude of variation of the values determined by IGC, as illustrated in \n\nFigure 7.18.

In the present study, \n\nhowever, the values of -?HAB are positive and good linear relationships were obtained \n\nbetween the enthalpies and the donor and acceptor numbers, thus validating the use of this \n\nmethodology. \n\nIt should be mentioned that the evaluation of the acid-base character of the surface is often \n\nperformed using the values of the work of adhesion of only one polar and one non-polar \n\nprobe.

In the present work five polar probes were tested, and subsequently \n\nthe acid-base character of the surface was evaluated by computing the values of Ka and \n\nKb, according to Figure 7.4. The values obtained for all samples are plotted in Figure 7.19. \n\n \n\nFigure 7.19 \u2013 Values of Ka and Kb computed from the IGC measurements for the different sizing agents and \n\ndifferent concentrations. \n\n \n\nFrom this plot, it is possible to observe that all the Ka and Kb values determined by IGC \n\nhave the same order of magnitude, and for most of the samples the Kb values are superior \n\nto those of Ka. This indicates that the surface of the papers is predominantly amphoteric with \n\na slight tendency to donate electrons (i.e. with a moderate basic character). In comparison to \n\nthe sample sized with cationic starch alone (St), it is possible to see that the largest impact of \n\nthe addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents is specially noticed on the values of Kb. \n\nThe surface acid-base character, evaluated by the Ka and Kb values, is ruled by the \n\navailability of functional groups at the paper surface. Thus, and similarly to the procedure \n\nfollowed in the last chapter, it is possible to elaborate further about the composition and \n\norientation of the molecules of the sizing agents.  \n\nPreviously published studies with IGC indicated that surface sizing decreases the paper \n\nsurface acidity, and stated that the availability of the hydroxyl groups (-OH) at the surface \n\nstrongly relates to the surface acidity (Tze and Gardner 2001; Shakery and Tabor-Haidar \n\n2004; Carvalho et al. 2005).  \n\nThe influence of the percentage of the incorporation of the sizing agent in the blend will be \n\nanalyzed individually, as in the previous chapter.

T. Moutinho 138 \n\nStarting with the sample sized with the synthetic sizing agent S1, (co-styrene-acrylate), no \n\nrelevant differences are found in the Ka values for 5 and 10 % incorporation (StS1-05 and \n\nStS1-10). Having in mind that the surface acidic character is related to carboxyl groups \n\n(COOH) and the proximity of Ka and Kb values at 5 and 10%, the most likely explanation is \n\nthat the amounts of the styrene and acrylate functional groups oriented outwards are \n\nequivalent. Nonetheless, for the 5% incorporation, a slight predominance of styrene is \n\ndetected whereas for 10% the opposite occurs (acrylate dominates). For 20% incorporation \n\n(StS1-20), a reduction in Ka and an increase in Kb were found, probably due to the \n\nelectronic cloud of the styrene. This interpretation, based on the molecular orientation, \n\nenables to justify the results obtained by the contact angle method for the polar component \n\nof the surface free energy (Figure 6.13), which were not explained there. \n\nAs for behavior of the sizing agent S9, which has the same composition of S1 (the difference \n\nbetween these two sizing agents lies on arrangement of the monomers), some assumptions \n\nregarding the orientation of its molecules at the paper surface were anticipated, in Chapter \n\n6, when analyzing the contact angle results for 5 and 10% of incorporation (Fig. 6.13). As \n\nexplained then, the styrene monomer was the one oriented outwards, and only for 20% \n\nincorporation, the acrylate monomer was the one predominantly turned out. The IGC results \n\nconfirm this analysis but reveals that at 5% incorporation the amount of styrene and acrylate \n\ngroups oriented outwards is similar, while at 10% the orientation of the styrene outwards \n\npredominates. These results also indicate that the arrangement of the monomers (styrene and \n\nacrylate) has a greater influence on the acid-base character of the sample StS9 than in the \n\ncase of sample StS1 (Figure 3.3). \n\nAlthough having the same monomers than S1 and S9, the results obtained by IGC for sample \n\nStS10 are inconclusive with regard to the orientation of the copolymer molecules at the \n\npaper surface.  \n\nAs for the surface sizing agent S2, composed of styrene and maleic anhydride, the results of \n\nthe contact angle measurements presented in Section 6.2.3 suggested that its molecules are \n\nprobably oriented so that the styrene monomer is turned to the exterior and the oxygen of \n\nthe maleic anhydride monomer point inwards for all concentrations. This hypothesis is in \n\nagreement with the IGC results presented in Figure 7.19. In fact, the increase of the Kb \n\nvalues in comparison to the reference sample (St) is certainly due to the presence of the \n\nelectronic cloud of the styrene monomer. In addition, when the amount of sizing agent is \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 139 \n\nincreased to 20% the electron accepting effect of the oxygen atoms of the maleic anhydride \n\nmonomer is strongly enhanced, as detected by the increase in Ka.  \n\nAnalyzing now the concentration of the sizing agent S4, which differs from the sizing agent \n\nS2 in the styrene/maleic anhydride ratio (Table 3.2),  and considering that styrene causes an \n\nincrease in Kb(as found for sample StS2), the enhancement of the basic character of samples \n\nStS4 in comparison with the St sample was to be expected. However, the increment in Kb is \n\nsmaller than that found for sample StS2 in agreement with the also smaller styrene amount.  \n\nAs for the surface sizing agent S3, which is quite distinct from the ones referred to in the \n\nprevious paragraphs, the analysis relative to the orientation of the acrylonitrile and acrylate \n\nmonomers at the paper surface derived from the contact angle data (Section 6.2.3) can not \n\nbe  confirmed by the IGC. Nevertheless, the variation of the Ka and Kb values are in perfect \n\nagreement with the copolymer composition: for 5% incorporation, a decrease of Ka \n\nrelatively to the reference sample St is observed, which is a consequence of the smaller \n\nacidic character of the copolymer in relation to the cationic starch; increasing the amount of \n\ncopolymer, the Ka gradually increases due to the augment of the number of electron \n\naccepting functional groups. \n\nRegarding the sizing agents S5, S6, S7 and S8, the IGC results are not conclusive in what \n\nconcerns the influence of the polymer concentration on Ka and Kb values neither on the \n\norientation at their molecules at the surface.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER 8 \n\n \n\nPRINTING QUALITY \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 143 \n\n8 PRINTING QUALITY \n\n8.1 THEORY \n\nAs described in Section 1.5, there are innumerous types of printing processes, however \n\nconsidering its importance in the P&amp;W papers applications, the printing process selected for \n\nthis work was inkjet printing.  \n\n8.1.1 INKJET PRINTING \n\nInkjet is a non-impact printing process, where the ink is emitted from a jet device, driven by \n\nan electronic signal, directly onto the substrate. The principles of inkjet were laid over a \n\ncentury ago, but the practical inkjet devices did not appear until the mid 1960\u2019s and in the \n\n1970\u2019s significant developmental efforts were made, the ink stream could be controlled and \n\nindividual droplets could be charged (Svanholm 2004). \n\nHowever the real breakthrough for inkjet technology came in the early 1980\u2019s, associated to \n\nthe introduction of IBM\u2019s personal computer (PC). In the beginning of the 1980\u2019s, \n\ntechnological advances such as the thermal printers invented by Canon (UK Patent - GB \n\n2007162A, 1987) and Hewlett Packard (US Patent \u2013 US 4490728, 1982) had made inkjet \n\na technology that was more reliable and more affordable, making it a strong potential \n\ncandidate for desktop printer applications (Svanholm 2004). \n\nIn 1984, Hewlett Packard launched their first line of low-cost printers with disposable inkjet \n\nprint heads, which reduced the cost even further. By the mid-1990\u2019s and onwards, the image \n\nquality, reliability and cost effectiveness had improved to a point where it was realistic for \n\ninkjet to compete with conventional small-scale printing. The resolution was improved from \n\naround 100 dots per inch (dpi) in the early 1980\u2019s to 2400 dpi in 2004 (Svanholm 2004). In \n\n1982-1984, an inkjet printer cost $1000-$6000. Nowadays a desktop inkjet printer can be \n\npurchased for as little as $50. \n\nThe principle of inkjet printing consists in directing individual drops to a paper surface in \n\norder to create an image. There are two main categories of inkjet printers (Oittinen and \n\nSaarelma 1998; Keskitalo 2000; Svanholm 2004): \n\n? Continuous (Figure 8.1a) \n\n? Drop-on-Demand \u2013 DoD (Figure 8.1b) \n\n \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M. T. Moutinho 144 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.1 \u2013 Example of (a) continuous and (b) Drop on Demand inkjet printers. \n\n \n\nThe continuous printers work by breaking up a continuous liquid stream into single droplets \n\n(normally using a piezo driver element). The droplets are subsequently charged individually \n\nand passed through a deflection array. The charge decides whether the droplets are to \n\nimpact onto the substrate or are sent into a gutter and recirculated to the drop generator. \n\nThe continuous printers are classified by the type of drop deflection method (multiple, binary, \n\nHertz or magnetic deflection) (Svanholm, 2004). \n\n \n\nFigure 8.2 \u2013 Schematic representation of the continuous inkjet printing system. \n\n \n\n(a)                                                                           (b) \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 145 \n\nThe DoD print heads work by ejecting droplets only when they are required for imaging on \n\nthe substrate. These print heads have a drop-ejection element that is located in an ink \n\nchannel near the nozzle. When a voltage pulse is applied to the drop ejection element, a \n\ndroplet is emitted. The DoD printers are organized by the type of drop-ejection element: \n\nthermal printers, which emit the droplet by a volume expansion of the heated ink (Figure \n\n8.3), and piezoelectric printers, which work by the high vibration of an electronically charged \n\npiezo-ceramic (Figure 8.4). Electrostatic and acoustic DoD printers also exist, but they are far \n\nless common than these two (Keskitalo 2000; Svanholm, 2004). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.3 - Schematic representation of the thermal inkjet DoD printing system. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.4 - Schematic representation of the piezoelectric inkjet DoD printing system. \n\n \n\nContinuous inkjet printers print at higher speeds because the drop generation rate is 10-100 \n\ntimes higher that the one achieved in DoD printers. However, they are also much more \n\ncomplicated and expensive, and this makes them more suitable for industrial applications \n\nsuch as the printing of packages, labels and direct mail (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; \n\nSvanholm, 2004). The use of DoD printers is limited due to the slow speed determined by the \n\nsystems physics. Consequently, DoD printers are mainly used for office, home and wide \n\nformat printing applications. Color pictures have an increasingly important role in home and \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M. T. Moutinho 146 \n\nwide format printing and digital photography is an important driving force behind color \n\nprinting in homes. In 2002, more than 95% of the color desktop printers in the world were \n\nDoD units (Svanholm, 2004). \n\nInkjet printing is a direct-to-substrate technology, since the ink goes directly from the ink \n\nchamber to the paper. It is thus of major importance that the ink to be used is appropriate \n\nfor the physical process adopted by the print head (Keskitalo 2000; Svanholm 2004). \n\nA characteristic of inkjet inks compared with inks in other printing methods is that have a low \n\nviscosity. This is especially true for the continuous stream inkjet method where rapid drop \n\nformation requires viscosity near 1 mPas. In thermal jetting, viscosity is commonly less than 5 \n\nmPas, being 10 mPas is the upper limit (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998).  \n\nInkjet inks are composed of mainly four components, with specific functions, as depicted in \n\nTable 8.1 (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Keskitalo 2000). \n\n \n\nTable 8.1 \u2013 Inkjet inks components. \n\nComponent Purpose Usual Proportion (%) \nPigment or Dye Coloring material 2 - 5 \n\nSolvent/vehicle \nCarrier phase for the dye or pigment \n\nAllows the desired low viscosity \nPrevents ink from drying in the nozzle \n\n95 - 98 \n\nBinder \nBinds the pigment on the paper (not \n\nalways used) \n \n\nAdditives \nCharge generation additives or \n\nPreservative additives \n2 \u2013 5  \n\n \n\nInkjet inks are currently commercially available in two different types: dye and pigment \n\nbased. In the first the color consists of highly diluted solutions of soluble organic dye \n\nmolecules, while pigmented inks consist in dispersions of micro-sized ink pigment particles of \n\napproximately 0.1 \u00b5m (Oittinen and Saarelma 1998; Keskitalo 2000; Glittenberg and \n\nVoigt 2004; Svanholm 2004). \n\nThe solvents are blends of water and various organic materials, typically high-boiling point \n\nalcohols. Solvents are used to enable the ink to penetrate the paper and for jet formation. \n\nEcological aspects, low viscosity and desired drying properties are the main criteria in \n\nselecting solvents for the inks (Donigian et al. 1999; Glittenberg and Voigt 2004; Svanholm \n\n2004) \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 147 \n\nMost aqueous inkjet inks have no binder. Binder-containing inks increase markedly in viscosity \n\nwhen small amounts of solvent are removed. When used, the polymeric binder creates a \n\nbridge between the pigment and the substrate. In water based inks the binder consists mainly \n\nof water-insoluble styrene- or acrylate-based polymers (Keskitalo 2000; Svanholm 2004) \n\nAdditives improve ink properties such as light stability or electrical charge (Oittinen and \n\nSaarelma 1998; Donigian et al. 1999; Keskitalo 2000). \n\nSurface tension plays an important role in the runnability of the inkjet printing process. In \n\nfact, a high surface tension to form ink drops, but to be able to penetrate the paper, the \n\nsolvent has to have a low surface tension. In water based inks surface tension is around 30 - \n\n60 dynes/cm, due to the mixing of water with organic compounds. This difference in surface \n\ntension suggests that water based inks can not be expected to behave as water (72 \n\ndynes/cm), in terms of paper penetration (Donigian et al. 1999; Keskitalo 2000). \n\nBefore drying, inkjet ink layers may be 15 \u00b5m or more in thickness for each color. For good \n\nprinted appearance, the dyes should be fixed on the paper\u2019s outer surface with only enough \n\nlateral spreading from the position of drop impact to merge adjacent drops in solid colors. In \n\nfact, proper dye fixation is the key to several components of inkjet print quality and, after \n\ndrying, the dyes should stay at the surface, even if this is rewetted (Donigian et al. 1999) \n\nAdditionally, because inkjet inks are highly fluid, highly surface active and penetrative and \n\nalso because of the high velocity of impact on the paper, inkjet papers require \n\ncharacteristics that match with the inks and the drop volumes. Inkjet papers must respond to \n\nhigh demands on properties such as surface tension, charge, roughness and porosity (Oittinen \n\nand Saarelma 1998; Donigian et al. 1999). \n\n \n\n8.1.2 PRINTING QUALITY EVALUATION \n\nAs mentioned in Section 1.5.1, there are no absolute definitions and concepts to define print \n\nquality and the corresponding paper ideal characteristics. They depend on the final use of \n\nthe printed product. \n\nAn ideal paper for inkjet printing must meet several runnability and printing quality \n\nrequirements. For runnability the critical operation is feeding, which is influenced by friction \n\ncoefficient, static electricity and cutting quality. Regarding printing quality, paper-ink \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

Certain types of printability test \n\nare used for all types of papers regardless the printing method used, while some other test \n\nmethods are only suitable for papers specific of a certain printing process. For inkjet printing \n\nquality some laboratory printing tests are commonly used, such as print density, print through, \n\ndot gain, circularity, and sharpness or inter color bleeding (Levlin and S\u00f6derhjelm 2000). \n\nThe assessment of printing quality either in qualitative or in quantitative terms is the subject \n\nof many published studies (Varnell 1998; Chen et al. 2002; Donderi et al. 2003; Mattila et \n\nal. 2003; Rosenberger 2003; Danby and Zhou 2004; Lee et al. 2005; Yang et al. 2005; \n\nOlsson et al. 2006; M\u00e4kenen et al. 2007; Sreekumar et al. 2007; Ungh et al. 2007; \n\nMoutinho et al. 2007b). Some printing quality parameters found relevant for this study are \n\npresented in Section 8.1.2.1 (Kowalczyk and Trksak 1998; Oittinen and Saarelma, 1998; \n\nVarnell 1998; Lehtinen 2000; Levlin and S\u00f6derhjelm 2000; Hladnik 2003; Lee et al. 2005; \n\nMoutinho et al. 2007b; Sreekumar et al. 2007). \n\n \n\n8.1.2.1 Inkjet Printing Quality Parameters \n\nPrinting quality parameters are mainly intended for the evaluation of two different \n\ncharacteristics of the printed image, the intensity or range of the color reproduction and the \n\nimage contour definition. In this work, the color intensity will be accessed through optical \n\ndensity and gamut area, while for accessing image definition the gain, raggedness and \n\nfeathering were measured, as described in Section 8.1.2.2. \n\nOptical Density measurement is probably the most commonly used property for printing \n\nquality evaluation. It abbreviates as OD, and is given by the relation between the intensity \n\nof the light reflected from a paper sheet before printing (I0) and after printing (I), as \n\ndescribed in Figure 8.5. The calculation is performed according to Equation 9.1. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.5 - Schematic representation of the light beams involved in the optical density measurement. \n\n \n\nIi If \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

Density measurements do not \n\nhave standard conditions: usually angles relative to the normal surface of 45\u00ba in illumination \n\nand zero in detection are used. In terms of printing quality, the higher the optical density \n\nvalues the better. \n\nThe evaluation of color reproduction ability is based on the coordinates a* and b*, which \n\nrepresent the saturation of the color in the CIELAB color space (Figure 8.6). L* is a measure of \n\nperceived lightness, ranging in the scale 0-100; a* is a measure of the hue on the red/green \n\naxis (a positive value for a* means red, and a negative value means green); b* is a measure \n\nof hue on the yellow/blue axis (a positive b* means yellow, and a negative value means \n\nblue). Greater values of a* and b* correspond to more saturated colors, so that absolute \n\nvalues of a* and b*of strongly saturated spectral colors range between 80 and 90 (Levin \n\nand S\u00f6derhjelm, 2000). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.6 \u2013 Representation of the CIELAB color space. \n\n \n\nGamut Area is then a color relater parameter, which evaluates the colors that each paper \n\ncan reproduce. It corresponds to the area of the hexagon whose vertices are the pairs (a*, \n\nb*) obtained for cyan, yellow, magenta, green, blue and red areas of a specified mask, \n\nplotted as depicted in Figure 8.7.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

Also in this case, smaller values of feathering correspond to better printing quality. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.8 \u2013 Exemplification of feathering of a printed area. \n\n-100\n\n-80\n\n-60\n\n-40\n\n-20\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n-100 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100\n\na*\n\nb* Paper 1\n\nPaper 2\n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

Poor penetration of the ink vehicle means slow drying of the ink, which \n\nresults in problems of color bleeding and feathering. On the other hand, too much \n\npenetration of the colored dye reduces color saturation, producing an image of inferior \n\nquality. For good print quality a compromise must be achieved between ink drying (which \n\nrequires good penetration) and color saturation (which require poor penetration) (Keskitalo, \n\n2000; Svanholm, 2004). \n\n \n\n8.1.2.2 Methodology  \n\nFor the evaluation of the inkjet printing quality of all the samples produced three main \n\naspects were addressed in this study: color reproduction intensity/range and image \n\ndefinition, as quantitative information, and human perception of printing quality, as \n\nsubjective qualitative assessment of the papers performance in terms of inkjet printing \n\nquality. For that a specific mask was selected were three zones can be isolated (Figure 8.9): \n\n? Zone A \u2013 where the color related measurements were performed; \n\n? Zone B \u2013 where the line quality was evaluated; \n\n? Zone C \u2013 used for the subjective printing quality evaluation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

T. Moutinho 153 \n\nOptical Density (OD) values were measured in the black, cyan, magenta and yellow areas in \n\nthe zone indicated as A in Figure 8.9 using the spectrophotometer Gretag D19C. At least \n\nthree measurements for each color were performed in each printed sample and an average \n\nvalue was computed for the OD values of each color and paper. \n\nThe CIELab color coordinates (a*, b*) used to compute the gamut area values were assessed \n\nusing the AvaMouse spectrophotometer. For each paper sheet, two separate measurements \n\nof a* and b* for each of the six colors (A zone of the mask) were performed, and the gamut \n\narea was computed using the average values of those measurements. This procedure was \n\nrepeated for the two sheets printed for each paper type, and the average of the two values \n\nwas used for further analysis. \n\nRegarding the image definition, accessed in this work by evaluation the line quality a \n\npersonal image analysis system PIA BASF \u2013 8042319 was used in the black line with yellow \n\nbackground (B zone of the mask). For each type of paper tested, the average of six \n\nmeasurements was considered (three separated measurements for each printed sheet). Each \n\nof the three measurements performed by sheet corresponds to a different zone of the \n\nprinted line and to six measurements of each property. The variables measured by this \n\ndevice are named as plain (mm2), borderlenght (mm) and roughness and are used to access \n\nthe printing quality parameters gain, feathering and raggedness, respectively. \n\nThe subjective evaluation was based on the perception of an independent panel of ten \n\ndifferent persons, regarding the images printed (zone C of Figure 8.9). The following \n\nprocedure was used: \n\n? The pictures were separated in four groups (corresponding to two pictures in two sheets \n\nof each type of paper).  \n\n? Each panel member was asked, for each of the four groups separately, to classify the \n\nimages according to his personal preference in a 0 to 100 scale, assigning a different \n\nclassification only when perceiving a relevant difference between the samples. \n\n? The results were normalized according to the maximum and minimum values used by \n\neach person, in order to allow the comparison of the results. \n\n? The average of the normalized rating achieved for each sample was computed and \n\nused for further analysis. \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

To determine which parameters are the most \n\nimportant to describe the samples printability, PCA was used, and a 73% degree of \n\nexplanation of the results variability (42% 1st component; 31% 2nd component) was obtained \n\n(Figure 8.10). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.10 \u2013 PCA for all the printing quality parameters. \n\n \n\nSince the optical densities of the three colors cyan, magenta and yellow are in the same zone \n\nof the plot, and yellow is the most critical in terms of achieving a good inkjet printing quality, \n\nthe OD of cyan and magenta were no further considered. The same overlapping was found \n\nfor the line quality parameters (feathering, raggedness and gain), after testing several \n\nsolutions it was decided to consider only the gain. Next, a new PCA was performed using the \n\nremaining four variables (OD black, OD yellow, gamut area and gain) and the result is \n\npresented in Figure 8.11. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.11 \u2013 PCA using 4 printing quality parameters. \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

The lines delimit the range in which it is \n\nconsidered that the samples can not be clearly differentiated from the St sample. \n\n \n\nThe black optical density values generally increase with the addition of the synthetic surface \n\nsizing agents to the surface sizing formulation (Figure 8.12). As for the yellow optical density \n\na slight increase relative to the reference sample is detected only in some situations (Figure \n\n8.13 and the measurements do not allow to differentiate the samples within the limits \n\nconsidered.  \n\nThe increase of the OD values is probably influenced by the increase of the surface \n\nhydrophobicity of the samples due to the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agent, and \n\nit is more visible when using the black ink because it has as surface tension value more close \n\nto the one of the water than the one of the yellow ink (Donigian et al. 1999). \n\nIt is important to emphasize that, in spite of the small differences, for both black and yellow \n\ncolors, the optical density values of all samples are acceptable in terms of printing quality \n\n(values superior to 2 for black ink and 0.9 for the yellow ink).

Therefore, the use of more precise \n\nprinting quality evaluation techniques to detect and quantify the differences between the \n\nsamples is desirable. \n\nNonetheless the remarks presented, it is possible to state that the addition of synthetic \n\nsurface sizing agents to the surface sizing formulation improves some printing quality \n\nparameters and in some cases an overall improvement of the printing quality in terms of \n\nboth, quantitative parameters and perceived printing quality was noticed.  \n\nIn order to relate this printing quality performance with the results of the previous analysis \n\nregarding the interactions at the paper surface and the effect of each surface sizing agent \n\ninto the surface properties of the paper samples, partial least squares (PLS) numerical \n\nmodels were used.

Moutinho 169 \n\n9 COMPLEMENTARY STUDIES \n\nThis chapter reports some relevant studies that were performed using paper samples \n\nproduced in this work, oriented to specific objectives, and thus subject of isolated papers. \n\n \n\nThe paper \u201cEffect of surface sizing on the surface chemistry of paper containing \n\neucalyptus pulp\u201d aims at verify for this type of papers the suitability of ESCA and ToF-SIMS \n\nin obtaining detailed information about the chemical composition of the outermost surface \n\nlayers of the surface sized papers and at answering the question how those surface layers \n\nare affected by the surface sizing formulations.  \n\nThis specific study allowed to conclude that ESCA complemented with ToF-SIMS is a good \n\nway to evaluate the effect of different sizing formulations. The elements present at the \n\nsamples surfaces were identified and their relative quantity could be evaluated. It was also \n\npossible to confirm that the samples surfaces exhibited distinct chemical characteristics. \n\nAlthough both formulations possessed the same percentage of cationic starch, relatively more \n\nof this polymer was detected on the sample surfaces, if co-acrylonitrile-acrylate was \n\napplied. This result was interpreted in terms of the properties of copolymers particles. It is \n\nsuggested that the co-acrylonitrile-acrylate particles penetrate deeper to the paper structure \n\nthan the co-styrene-acrylate particles due to their lower surface tension and therefore leave \n\nbehind relatively more starch at the paper surface. Additionally, it was found that the \n\nincrease of the sizing pick-up from 3.5 to 9.0 g m-2 only slightly changed the surface \n\ncharacteristics. Accordingly, lower amount of size is enough for surface improvement. \n\n \n\nThe paper \u201cOn the evaluation of the topography of surface sized Eucalyptus based \n\npapers\u201d aims at compare the surface structure of two paper samples with different surface \n\nsizing treatments by using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The sizing performance is also \n\nevaluated in terms of uniformity, particle size, shape and distribution over the paper surface \n\nas well as in terms of surface topography.  \n\nThis specific study indicated that AFM and SEM can be complementary used to study paper \n\nsurface sizing. SEM allows a general evaluation of the surface and AFM enables to resolve \n\nsmall details on the paper surface, showing topographic differences not only between the \n\nunsized and sized samples but also between samples sized with distinct surface sizing \n\n\n\n  Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\n   Isabel M.

Nonetheless, these differences were not \n\nreflected in the roughness parameters quantified by AFM. Despite considerable differences \n\nbetween the absolute values of AFM and profilometry, the results of the latter (with much less \n\ndeviations) confirm that both the unsized and the sized samples exhibited very similar \n\nroughness parameter values. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M.

In addition, it was found that application of higher amounts of the sizing \n\nformulations, at a constant ratio of 20% copolymer to starch, did not change significantly the chemical \n\nproperties of the paper surfaces.  \n\n \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe papermaking industry has to increase its know-how and to improve the quality of all paper grades \n\n(COST E32 2002; Pruszynski 2003) because of the increasing demand of costumers and the competition \n\nbetween information media. For printing and writing papers and other special paper grades, physical \n\nand chemical properties of paper surfaces are critical for achieving a good performance of the final \n\nproducts (Lertsutthiwong et al. 2004; Carceller and Juppo 2004; Laleg 2004). The physical structure of \n\nthe paper surface \u2013 its roughness and porosity, for example \u2013 plays an outstanding role on the quality of \n\nthe printed details. The surface is influenced by the structural , and surface characteristics of the fibers, \n\nfines, and mineral fillers of the paper matrix, Moreover, the surface chemistry of paper has a great \n\nimpact on the spreading and absorption rate of coating colors and inks. The surface characteristics of \n\npapers depend on the base paper composition and on the surface treatments, such as coating and \n\nsurface sizing (Rutar and Hladnik 2000; Keskitalo 2000; Oliver et al. 2001; Koskela and Hormi 2003). \n\nSurface sizing influences the porosity, roughness, internal strength of the paper, particles detachment, and \n\nthe hydrophobic character of surface. The latter is important to prevent excessive absorption of liquids. \n\nStarch and synthetic polymers are common sizing chemicals and these also have an influence on the \n\nphysical and chemical properties of paper bulk (Pruszynski 2003; Koskela and Hormi 2003; \n\nLertsutthiwong et al. 2004; Laleg 2004; Me\u0161ic et al. 2004; Moutinho et al. 2007). \n\nThe characterization of paper surfaces is of outermost importance for evaluating the effect of sizing and \n\nselecting the most appropriate chemicals for a specific base paper (Donigian et al. 1997; Shirazi et al. \n\n2003; Forsstr\u00f6m  et al. 2003; Hladnik 2003; Lertsutthiwong et al. 2004; Carceller and Juppo 2004; \n\nMe\u0161ic et al. 204; Ajerschi 2004; Hamers 2005). \n\nFrom the techniques currently available for chemical characterization of the paper surfaces, the two most \n\ncapables were selected for this study. These are: 1) electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) \n\nand 2) time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Since the fundamentals of these \n\ntechniques are well described in the literature, only a short description of each one is provided in this \n\ntext. \n\nESCA has proved to be a sensitive technique for obtaining information about the chemical composition \n\nand structure of a solid surface, within a sampling depth of about 5 nm (Dorris and Gray 1978; Brinen, \n\n1993; Kleen et al. 2003; Kangas and Kleen 2004; Hale et al. 2007). It is based on the energy changes \n\nof the emitted electrons to generate a spectrum of peaks corresponding to the elements present on the \n\nsurface (except hydrogen and helium). The peak areas give measures of the relative amounts of each \n\nelement (absolute quantitative measurements are seldom feasible), whereas the shape and position of \n\n\n\n \n\n \nclxxv \n\nthe peaks reflect the chemical environment of each element, namely their bonding structure (Dorris and \n\nGray 1978; Brinen, 1993; Str\u00f6m et al. 1993; Kleen et al. 2003; Kangas and Kleen 2004; Hale et al. \n\n2007). \n\nToF-SIMS analysis provides additional information regarding the identification of not only elements but \n\nalso molecular species present on the surface. The distribution of molecules at the surface can be \n\ndeduced from the data, also as a function of depth at a submicron scale. This technique is suited for \n\ncomparison of samples as it delivers semi-quantitative information of the surface constituents (Kleen \n\n2000a; Kleen 2000b; Kristola 2001; Kangas and Kleen 2004; Kleen 2005; Lee t al. 2006; Parolis et al. \n\n2007). ToF-SIMS is based on ionized particles which are emitted from a solid surface when energetic \n\nprimary particles bombard that surface. The secondary ions are accelerated into a mass spectrometer, \n\nwhere they are analyzed by measuring their time-of-flight between the sample and the detector. Major \n\ncompounds in mixtures can be separated. The mass range and resolution of the technique are high. The \n\nanalyzed area in ToF-SIMS is smaller than that of ESCA, and the surface sensitivity is higher, because \n\nToF-SIMS analyzes the outermost surface layers of 1-2 nm. \n\nThere is large body of literature concerning paper analysis by ESCA (Dorris and Gray 1978; Kleen et \n\nal. 2002; Shchukarev et al. 2003; Johansson et al. 2005; Freire  et al. 2006) or by ToF-SIMS (Brinen \n\nand Proverb 1991; Kleen 2000a; Kleen 2000b; Kleen 2005; Fardim and Hombom 2005a; Fardim and \n\nHombom 2005b), or both ESCA and ToF-SIMS (Brinen 1993; Kleen et al. 2003; Kangas and Kleen \n\n2004). \n\nThe present work aims at obtaining detailed information about the chemical composition of the outermost \n\nsurface layers of the surface sized papers and at answering the question how those surface layers are \n\naffected by the surface sizing formulations.  \n\n \n\nExperimental \n\nPaper samples  \n\nA calendered uncoated base paper (80 g m-2) produced from bleached Eucalyptus globulus kraft pulp \n\n(ISO Brightness ? 90) and without any surface treatment was the reference (denoted as RP).

A 0.15 mm diameter roll was used \n\nat a velocity of 6 m min\u20131. The total surface sizing pick-up was controlled by the weight applied on top \n\nof the applicator roll: in case of no weight, a 3.5 \u00b1 0.3 g m-2 pick-up was obtained (samples A1 and B1), \n\nwhereas by placing two weights of 730 g each on the applicator roll a 9.0 \u00b1 0.3 g m-2 pick-up was \n\nobtained (samples A2 and B2). The drying process was performed by an IR drier coupled to the \n\napplicator roll (1.0 kW drying intensity), followed by air drying (for at least 10 min). The surface sized \n\nsamples were no further calendered. \n\nSurface analyses \n\nThe ESCA analyses: AXIS 165 high-resolution electron spectrometer; monochromatic Al K? irradiation \n\n(12.5 kV, 8 mA). For each sample, survey scans in the range 0-1100 eV (1 eV step, 80 eV analyzer pass \n\nenergy) and high-resolution spectra of the C 1s region (0.1 eV step, 20 eV pass energy) were recorded \n\nat three different locations. The areas of the peaks corresponding to carbon (200-300 eV), calcium (350 \n\neV), nitrogen (400 eV), oxygen (500-600 eV), and sodium (1000-1100 eV) were measured. The \n\nanalyzed area was approximately 1 mm2 and the depth of analysis was 2-10 nm. The sample surfaces \n\nwere neutralized during the measurements with low-energy electrons. \n\nToF-SIMS measurements: PHI TRIFT II time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometer. High mass resolution \n\nspectra and images in positive and negative ion modes were acquired by a 69Ga+ liquid metal ion gun \n\nwith 15 keV primary ions in bunched mode for mass spectra and with 25 keV primary ions in unbunched \n\nmode for images over the mass range 2-2000 m z-1. The primary ion current was 600 pA and time per \n\nchannel 0.138 ns. The analysis area was 200 \u00d7 200 \u00b5m2 and the acquisition time 2 min for spectra and \n\n5 min for images. Analytical charge compensation was used for insulating samples. The calculated ion \n\ndose was 2.7?1011 cm-2, which ensured static conditions during data acquisition. Three replicate runs were \n\nmade for each sample. Selected peak areas were integrated from ToF-SIMS spectra and normalized to \n\nthe total ion intensity of the spectrum. Images were reconstructed from raw data files with the off-line \n\nWinCadence software. \n\nResults and discussion \n\nElectron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) \n\nThe elements present at the paper surface can be identified from the survey scans obtained by ESCA. \n\nFigure 2 includes the results of the reference paper (RP) and of samples A1 and B1. The spectra of \n\nsamples A2 and B2 corresponding to the largest amount of sizing agents are not shown here because \n\nthey revealed only minor differences in the intensity of the peaks compared with samples A1 and B1, \n\nrespectively. \n\n\n\n \n\n clxxviii \n\n \n\nFigure  2  Spectra of the ESCA survey scans: (a) sample RP; (b) sample A1;(c) sample B1. \n\n \n\nThe peaks corresponding to carbon, oxygen, and sodium can be easily detected in all the samples, \n\nwhereas calcium is only visible in the reference paper and nitrogen in sample A1 (and A2). As readily \n\nvisible, the most abundant elements are carbon and oxygen (hydrogen is not detectable by ESCA). For \n\nquantification, the amount of each element, relative to all specimens detected in the surface of each \n\nsample, was determined by measuring the peak area. The results, based on the analyses of three \n\nlocations in each paper sample, are summarized in Figure 3 together with the reproducibility of the \n\nresults. The reproducibility is satisfactory. \n\n\n\n \n\n \nclxxix \n\nC 1s\n\n60.0\n\n62.0\n\n64.0\n\n66.0\n\n68.0\n\nRP A1 B1 A2 B2\n\nSample\nA\n\nm\no\n\nu\nn\n\nt \n(%\n\n)\n\n(a) \n\nCa 2p\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nRP A1 B1 A2 B2\n\nSample\n\nA\nm\n\no\nu\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\n(b) \n\nNa 1s\n\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\nRP A1 B1 A2 B2\n\nSample\n\nA\nm\n\no\nu\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\n(c) \n\nO 1s\n\n31.0\n\n33.0\n\n35.0\n\n37.0\n\n39.0\n\nRP A1 B1 A2 B2\n\nSample\n\nA\nm\n\no\nu\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\n(d) \n\nN 1s\n\n-0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nRP A1 B1 A2 B2\n\nSample\n\nA\nm\n\no\nu\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\n   \n\n(e) \n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3  Relative amount of each element, obtained by ESCA for each sample: (a) carbon; (b) calcium; (c) \n\noxygen; (d) sodium; (e) nitrogen.  \n\n \n\nThe amounts of carbon and calcium present at the surface of the reference paper (RP) are higher than \n\nthose at the surface of the surface sized papers (Figure 3). The opposite is true for oxygen and sodium. \n\nThe much larger amount of calcium detected in the reference paper is associated with the precipitated \n\n\n\n \n\n clxxx \n\ncalcium carbonate applied as filler, which is almost completely covered the surface after sizing. The same \n\ncovering effect may be responsible for the slight decrease of the carbon percentage in the sized \n\nsamples, while the proportion of oxygen is increased. The presence of NaCl in the cationic starch \n\nsuspension (supplied by the industry) causes the increase of sodium at the surface of the sized papers, in \n\ncomparison with the reference paper. \n\nAlthough the co-styrene-acrylate polymer (B) contained about 1.5% more oxygen than the co-\n\nacrylonitrile-acrylate polymer (A), similar amounts of oxygen were found on the surface of A and B sized \n\npapers (Figure 3c). This indicates that relatively more of the oxygen-rich starch and less copolymer were \n\nfound on the A sized papers. Besides, though having a low surface tension, starch has large particles \n\n(Table 2) which leads to high surface concentrations. We suggest that copolymer A can easier penetrate \n\ninto paper than copolymer B, which can be explained by its lower surface tension (Table 2). Finally, and \n\nas expected, the quantity of nitrogen increased significantly in samples A1 and A2 due to the presence \n\nof acrylonitrile copolymer. \n\nIt is obvious that no relevant benefits arise from increasing the surface sizing pick-up from 3.5 to 9.0 g m-\n\n2 since, in general, the differences between the reference paper and samples A1 and A2 are identical. \n\nThe same is true for samples B1 and B2. Therefore, from a chemical point of view, a pick-up level of 3.5 \n\ng m-2 seems to be enough to promote the key changes intended by surface sizing. \n\nThe relative contents of the different \u201ctypes\u201d of carbon, considering their chemical environment and \n\nbonding structure, were determined from their high resolution spectra of carbon (Figure 4). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \nclxxxi \n\nC2\n\n45.0\n\n51.0\n\n57.0\n\n63.0\n\n69.0\n\n75.0\n\nRP A1 B1 A2 B2\n\nSample\n\nA\nm\n\no\nu\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\nC1\n\n12.0\n\n18.0\n\n24.0\n\n30.0\n\n36.0\n\n42.0\n\nRP A1 B1 A2 B2\n\nSample\n\nA\nm\n\no\nu\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\nC4\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n1.2\n\n1.8\n\n2.4\n\n3.0\n\nRP A1 B1 A2 B2\n\nSample\nA\n\nm\no\n\nu\nn\n\nt \n(%\n\n)\n\nC3\n\n10.0\n\n11.5\n\n13.0\n\n14.5\n\n16.0\n\nRP A1 B1 A2 B2\n\nSample\n\nA\nm\n\no\nu\n\nn\nt \n\n(%\n)\n\n(c) (d) \n\n(a) (b) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4  Quantification of the different types of chemical bonds detected by ESCA for the carbon atoms: (a) C1 \n\n(C\u2013C, C=C, C\u2013H); (b) C2 (C\u2013O); (c) C3 (C=O, O\u2013C\u2013O); (d) C4 (O\u2013C=O). \n\n \n\nThese results with a very good reproducibility are in agreement with the molecular structure of the sizing \n\nagents depicted in Figure 1. In fact, the relative amount of C1 is considerably higher for RP, especially in \n\ncomparison with papers A1 and A2, probably mainly because of lower percentage of C=C bonds in the \n\nsized papers. Acrylonitrile-acrylate copolymer (A), e.g., do not contain any C=C bonds (Figure 1a). It is \n\nalso clear that, in terms of the type of different carbon bonds, there is a greater resemblance between \n\nsamples B1 and B2 and the RP (Figure 4a-c) than between the latter and samples A1 and A2. The \n\nexception occurs for the O\u2013C=O bonds (C4, Figure 4d), which are predominant in the styrene-acrylate \n\ncopolymer (B1 and B2). This result is also supported by the results from elemental analysis demonstrating \n\nthat the copolymer B contains more oxygen than the copolymer A. \n\nTime of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) \n\nBoth positive and negative ion ToF-SIMS spectra were recorded. In order to identify the most significant \n\npeaks corresponding to the sizing agents, subtraction of the reference paper spectrum was performed \n\n(Figure 5). The upper parts of each difference spectra show the peaks which are typical for the sized \n\npapers, while the peaks in the lower side represent the reference paper. Figure 5a (m z-1 0 \u2013 70, \n\npositive ion difference spectra), Figure 5b (m z-1 70 \u2013 110, positive ion difference spectra) and Figure 5c \n\n(m z-1 0 \u2013 70, negative ion difference spectra) show the results for paper A1, while the corresponding \n\ndifference spectra for paper B1 are presented in Figs. 5d-f. The most relevant peaks are listed in Table \n\n3. The difference spectra revealed more typical peaks than presented in Table 3 for both the starch and \n\nthe acrylates, but the selected peaks are the most intense ones for the compounds and therefore they \n\nwere evaluated. Sodium, calcium, cationic starch, and acrylate were evaluated from the positive mass \n\nspectra, whereas acrylonitrile was analyzed from the negative mass spectra. \n\n\n\n \n\n clxxxii \n\nd a \n\ne b \n\nf c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5  ToF-SIMS difference spectra between the sized paper A1 and the reference paper (a-c) as well as that \n\nbetween the sized paper B1 and the reference paper (d-f).  \n\n \n\nThe difference spectra in Figure 5 confirm that the surfaces of the samples exhibit distinct chemical \n\ncharacteristics. The surface characteristics of the sized papers clearly differ from those of the reference \n\npaper. Also, the differently sized papers clearly differ from each other having typical characteristics of \n\ntheir own in addition to their similarities, which originated from cationic starch and acrylate, both present \n\nin sized papers. According to Figure 5, the reference paper contains more calcium (peak at m z-1 40) \n\nthan the sized papers, whereas the sized papers have more sodium (peak at m z-1 23), cationic starch \n\n(peaks at m z-1 58 and 59) (Matsushita et al. 2007), and acrylate (peaks at m z-1 71, 73, 85, 87, 99 \n\nand 101) on their surfaces. Since the difference spectra for samples A2 and B2 were quite similar to the \n\nones given for A1 and B1, respectively, they are not presented here. It should be mentioned that, \n\naccording to some authors, the penetration of the cationic starch may be larger than the depth of \n\nanalysis achieved by this technique (Lipponen, 2004; Lipponen, 2005). \n\nThe difference spectra between the negative ion ToF-SIMS spectra from the sized papers and the RP \n\n(Figure 5c,f) indicates the presence of acrylonitrile (peak m z-1 26) on the surface of A1, but not on the \n\n\n\n \n\n \nclxxxiii \n\nsurface of B1 paper. Corresponding results were also observed for A2 and B2 samples. In addition, the \n\nresults in Figure 5c,f support the ESCA results (Figure 3c) showing that there is more oxygen (peak m z-1 \n\n16) on the surfaces of the sized papers than on the surface of the RP. \n\nAs an attempt to determine the relative quantity of each chemical specimen for each paper sample, the \n\nareas of the peaks in Table 3 were integrated from the original positive and negative ion ToF-SIMS \n\nspectra.

Somewhat larger relative amounts of starch are detected on the surfaces of samples A1 and A2 in \n\ncomparison to B1 and B2. This is in agreement with the results from ESCA. Probably, the co-acrylonitrile-\n\nacrylate particles have penetrated more easily the bulk of paper than the co-styrene-acrylate ones. As \n\ndiscussed before, this is probably due to the surface tension values. Some increase in the surface \n\nconcentration of starch was observed when the amount of size was almost threefold. \n\nThe results further confirm the presence of acrylate in all the sizing formulations (Figure 6d). The amount \n\nof acrylate on the surfaces of B samples is higher than in the A samples, probably due to its higher \n\nconcentration in B formulations. Large amount of acrylonitrile was found on the sized A papers, as \n\nexpected. Paper A2 had clearly higher surface concentration of acrylonitrile than paper A1. Neither the \n\nRP nor the sized B papers contain acrylonitrile. \n\nIn general, the increase of the surface sizing pick-up from 3.5 to 9.0 g m-2 in both cases had relatively \n\nlow impact on the paper surface composition. The surface concentration of sodium and starch increased \n\nslightly, while that of acrylonitrile increased somewhat more. These effects were not seen with ESCA. ToF-\n\nSIMS is more sensitive with this regard as ESCA. \n\nToF-SIMS also provides additional information about the spatial distribution of surface compounds. \n\nFigure 7 presents the sodium images of the five samples analyzed in this study. Sodium images were \n\nchosen since it was already proved that the sodium is from the sizing blends. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7  Calcium images of the various samples: a) RP; b) A1; c) B1; d) A2; e) B2.  \n\n \n\nThe larger area of white spots in Figures 7b to 7e confirms the presence of the surface sizing in samples \n\nA1, A2, B1 and B2. More sizing was found on A2 and B2 than on A1 and B1, respectively. Although \n\ndistributed throughout the paper surfaces, the sizing formulation does not form a continuous film. \n\n(d)                                   (e) \n\n(a)                                    (b)                                   (c) \n\n\n\n \n\n clxxxvi \n\n \n\nConclusions \n\nESCA complemented with ToF-SIMS proved to be a good way to evaluate the effect of different sizing \n\nformulations. The elements present at the samples surfaces were identified and their relative quantity \n\ncould be evaluated. It was also possible to confirm that the samples surfaces exhibited distinct chemical \n\ncharacteristics. Although both formulations possessed the same percentage of cationic starch, relatively \n\nmore of this polymer was detected on the sample surfaces, if co-acrylonitrile-acrylate was applied. This \n\nresult was interpreted in terms of the properties of copolymers particles. It is suggested that the co-\n\nacrylonitrile-acrylate particles penetrate deeper to the paper structure than the co-styrene-acrylate \n\nparticles due to their lower surface tension and therefore leave behind relatively more starch at the \n\npaper surface. Additionally, it was found that the increase of the sizing pick-up from 3.5 to 9.0 g m-2 \n\nonly slightly changed the surface characteristics. Accordingly, lower amount of size is enough for surface \n\nimprovement. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements \n\nThe authors acknowledge the EU COST E32 Action \"Characterization of Paper Surfaces for Improved \n\nPrinting paper Grades\u201d for the financial support to a STSM at the KCL Pulp and Paper institute, Espoo - \n\nFinland and at the \u00c5bo Akademi University, Turku - Finland.  \n\n \n\nReferences \n\nAjerschi, M., Poirier, N., Pikulik, I.

The present work compares paper samples with two different surface sizing \n\ntreatments by using AFM and profilometry to assess topography and roughness parameters as well as to \n\nevaluate the spreading of the sizing formulation and to estimate sizing agent particle sizes. The results \n\nwere confronted with dynamic light scattering measurements regarding particle size. This work shows that \n\nAFM is a valuable technique to visualize the effects of sizing onto the paper surface. However, due to the \n\nsmall pick up applied no differences could be detected in terms of the surface roughness parameters. \n\n \n\nKEYWORDS \n\nAFM, Optical profilometry, Light scattering, Surface sizing, Surface roughness. \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nPrinting quality is strongly influenced by the structural and chemical properties of paper surface, which \n\ndepend not only on the fibrous matrix but also on the final treatment of the surface.  This treatment may \n\nbe of physical nature, like calendering, and/or of chemical nature, like surface sizing or coating. A \n\ncommon practice in industry regarding surface sizing, which was also followed in this work, is to use a \n\nblend of cationic starch and a synthetic surface sizing agent1-3. \n\nMany studies pertaining paper coating can be found in the open literature, concerning in particular the \n\ncharacterization of paper surface in terms of physical and chemical properties4-7. However, not many of \n\nthese are related to the surface sizing of fine papers. The present work aims at comparing the surface \n\nstructure of two paper samples with different surface sizing treatments by using Atomic Force Microscopy \n\n\n\n \n\n cxciv \n\n(AFM). The sizing performance will be evaluated in terms of uniformity, particle size, shape and \n\ndistribution over the paper surface as well as in terms of surface topography. \n\nAlthough Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) has been traditionally used for surface analysis, it requires \n\na laborious sample preparation (that can eventually change surface topography), needs vacuum and \n\ndoes not provide high contrast images on flat surfaces8. To overcome these drawbacks, AFM has been \n\nalternatively used, since it provides direct three-dimensional images of almost any type of surface in \n\nambient air conditions, requires no sample preparation and can resolve extremely small surface features \n\nboth at the micro- and nanoscale. Additionally, AFM images can be used to quantify surface roughness \n\nparameters. Other surface properties as hardness and adhesion can also be assessed. The technique \n\nseems therefore especially suited for the present study and has been previously applied by other authors \n\nfor pulp &amp; paper characterization9-12. The principles of AFM are well described in the literature13-15 and \n\ntherefore will not be detailed here.  \n\nIn the present work, the results obtained by AFM will be confronted with those of SEM in what concerns \n\nthe homogeneity of the surface treatment. The topographic parameters obtained by AFM will also be \n\ncompared with those provided by Optical Profilometry, a non-contact technique increasingly used for \n\nstudies of the paper surface3, 16. The equivalent mean diameter of the sizing particles estimated by AFM \n\nwill be further compared with measurements carried out in the sizing suspensions by Dynamic Light \n\nScattering (DLS). \n\n \n\nEXPERIMENTAL METHODS \n\nTwo distinct surface sizing treatments applied on a calendered uncoated base paper produced with a \n\nEucalyptus globulus Kraft pulp were analyzed. Two different blends of cationic starch and acrylate \n\ncopolymers, described in Table 1, were used for surface sizing. A sample of the base paper without any \n\nsurface treatment was taken as reference (RP).  \n\nTable 1.

A 0.15 mm roll was used \n\nand its velocity adjusted to 6m/min, so that a total surface sizing pick-up of 3.5 \u00b1 0.3 g/m2 (on \n\nboth sides of the sheet) was obtained. The drying process was performed in two steps: firstly \n\n\n\n \n\n \ncxcv \n\n(a)                                                                      (b) \n\nusing an IR drier coupled to the applicator roll (1.0 kW) followed by air drying for at least 10 \n\nmin. The surface sized samples were no further calendered. \n\nThe chemicals used for the preparation of the sizing formulations were provided by a paper mill \n\ninstead of being prepared in laboratory. Because of this, information about their properties was \n\nlimited and/or confidential and thus the most relevant had to be experimentally determined \n\n(Table 2). The calculation of the ratio of monomers of each copolymer was based on elemental \n\nanalysis. These results together with the software ChemSketch enabled to derive the schematic \n\nrepresentation of the chemical composition of the co-polymers, depicted in Figure 2.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.

High and low tapping images were acquired. Silicon cantilevers with a resonance \n\nfrequency of 250-319 kHz were used. The damping ratio set point amplitude/free amplitude \n\nwas varied between 0.5 and 0.8, and scanning rates from 0.7 to 2.0 Hz were used. The free \n\namplitude varied between 100 and 150 nm Images of the surface topography and phase \n\n\n\n \n\n cxcvi \n\ncontrast, corresponding to 512 \u00d7 512 pixels in size were acquired by measuring the three \n\nsamples (RP, A1, B1) in air. For that, areas of 5 \u00d7 5 \u00b5m2 were analyzed. Filtering was not used \n\nduring scanning. \n\nFrom AFM data, the following roughness parameters were computed, using at least eight images \n\nper sample17, 18: average roughness (Sa, \u00b5m); root mean square roughness (Sq, \u00b5m); maximum \n\npeak height (Sp, \u00b5m) maximum valley depth (Sv, \u00b5m); skewness (Ssk); and the ratio of the \n\ndeveloped surface area to the nominal surface area (Sdr). \n\nThe JSM-5310 Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) from Jeol was used with a 20 kV electronic \n\nbeam intensity and images with magnifications from 200\u00d7 to 3500\u00d7 were acquired (the images \n\nobtained with higher magnifications were not good enough for further analysis).  \n\nThe profilometry measurements were carried out using a monochromatic laser profilometer \n\nAltisurf 500 from AltiMet coupled with the PaperMap software. For each sample at least six \n\nimages of 4 \u00d7 4 mm2 in size were scanned with a scanning resolution of 2 \u00b5m. From the 2000 \n\nprofiles obtained for each piece, the aforementioned roughness parameters were computed. \n\nMean particle size and size distributions were measured for the sizing formulations by dynamic \n\nlight scattering (DLS) using the Coulter N4 Plus19, 20. Samples were previously sonicated. At least \n\nthree independent measurements were performed for each sample20. \n\n \n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was first applied in order to evaluate qualitatively the \n\nuniformity of the surface treatment. The resulting images are presented in Figure 2.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \ncxcvii \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

However, no fine structure can be \n\nresolved on the studied paper surfaces. \n\nOn the contrary, a more detailed structure is seen in Figure 3 which shows AFM topographic (a), \n\nphase contrast (b) and 3D simulation (c) images obtained in the high tapping mode for the \n\nsamples RP, A1 and B1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n cxcviii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

The images size is 5 \u00d7 5 \u00b5m2. \n\n \n\nFor the reference sample the fine structure of the cellulose fibre is resolved, consisting of bundles \n\nof microfibrils. In the sized samples these bundles are not visible, instead, a smoother surface is \n\napparent with a granular fine structure. The differences between the sized samples appear in \n\nterms of spreading of sizing formulation as well as the size of the grains (particles). The co-\n\nstyrene-acrylate appears to be more evenly spread over the paper surface than the co-\n\nacrylonitrile-acrylate. Besides, the particles of the former appear to be smaller and more \n\nspherical than those of the latter.  \n\nThe average values obtained for the topographical parameters, together with the corresponding \n\ndeviation values are listed in Table 3. Besides the roughness parameters, also the diameter of \n\n\n\n \n\n \ncxcix \n\nthe particles was estimated based on the projected areas of the particles by using a dedicated \n\nimage analysis software (SPIP\u00ae). \n\n \n\nTable 3.

This may refer to the low \n\nhomogeneity of the surfaces at the nanoscale. However, the most probable explanation is the \n\nanalyzed image area (5 \u00d7 5 \u00b5m2) in contrast to the size of the imaged objects, which may result \n\nin a data set in which part of the images represent a fibre surface, part of the images represent \n\nedges of the fibres, and some of the images may even represent the sizing material appearing \n\nbetween cellulose fibres.  \n\nHigher values were expected for the roughness parameters Sa, Sq, Sp and Sv of the reference \n\npaper, when comparing to those of the surface sized samples, due to the distinct topographic \n\nfeatures clearly visible in the 3D simulations of Figure 3. In spite of the aforementioned \n\nlimitations, the visual inspection of the AFM images revealed two important differences between \n\nthe surface sized samples A1 and B1, not detected by the SEM analysis: the particles \n\ncorresponding to the sizing formulation of sample B1 are smaller (as confirmed by the values of \n\nTable 3) and more uniformly distributed on the paper surface. \n\nAs mentioned before, the results of AFM were confronted with those obtained by dynamic light \n\nscattering (regarding particle size) and profilometry (regarding topographic parameters). Table \n\n4 presents the comparison of the diameter of the particles computed from AFM data and \n\ndirectly measured in the sizing suspensions by DLS. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n cc \n\n \n\nTable 4.

It should be pointed out that discrepancies \n\nbetween the results of the two techniques were expected since, in AFM, particles are analyzed in \n\nthe solid state being most probably aggregated, whereas by DLS they are analyzed in the \n\nliquid suspension adequately dispersed. Furthermore, the tip-sample convolution results in \n\ndistorted (too large) lateral dimensions of the imaged objects. The low values obtained for the \n\npolydispersity index guarantee the reliability of the DLS analysis (0.38 and 0.21 for A and B, \n\nrespectively). The results of the optical profilometry analysis are listed in Table 5. \n\n \n\nTable 5.

This apparent \n\ndiscrepancy obtained with different techniques is also found in the results reported by other \n\nauthors (Xu et al. 2005). The standard deviations for each measurement are much smaller, \n\nindicating that roughness at the macro-scale was less heterogeneous than roughness at the micro-\n\nscale (assessed by AFM). The much larger areas scanned by profilometry may certainly \n\ncontribute to this remarkable reduction in the variability of the results. From Table 5, it is also \n\nclear that, once again, no significant differences exist between the three samples, in agreement \n\n\n\n \n\n \ncci \n\nwith the results of AFM, and that the surface of the paper samples is mainly composed of valleys \n\nrather than peaks since Sv is consistently larger than Sp and, simultaneously, Ssk is negative. \n\nIn general, the results of AFM and optical profilometry show that the three samples tested \n\nappeared visually different, but the data was too heterogeneous to be able to demonstrate \n\nquantitative differences in the roughness parameter values. Two facts may contribute to this \n\nresult: i) the pick-up used in each surface size treatment (approximately 1,7 g/m2, similar to the \n\nvalues used in industry) was probably not enough to introduce significant changes in the surface \n\nroughness of the reference paper; and, ii) the two sizing formulations being too identical to \n\ncause distinct impacts on topographic parameters (in fact, they contain both 80% of starch and \n\nonly 20% of different copolymers (co-acrilonitryle-acrylate or co-styrene-acrylate) with \n\ndifferent particle sizes). Nonetheless, it should be mentioned that these formulations originate \n\nimportant differences in terms of surface chemistry, as described by the authors in another \n\npublication21.  \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nThe above results confirm that AFM and SEM can be complementary used to study paper surface \n\nsizing, SEM allows a general avaluation of the surface and AFM enables to resolve small details \n\non the paper surface, showing topographic differences not only between the unsized and sized \n\nsamples but also between samples sized with distinct surface sizing formulations. In fact, \n\ndifferences both in the copolymer distribution on the paper surface and in the copolymers \n\nparticle size were clearly visible. Nonetheless, these differences were not reflected in the \n\nroughness parameters quantified by AFM  \n\nDespite considerable differences between the absolute values of AFM and profilometry, the \n\nresults of the latter (with much less deviations) confirm that both the unsized and the sized \n\nsamples exhibited very similar roughness parameter values. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n\nThe authors acknowledge the EU COST E32 Action \"Characterization of Paper Surfaces for \n\nImproved Printing paper Grades\u201d for the financial support to a STSM at the KCL Pulp and \n\nPaper institute, Espoo - Finland and at the \u00c5bo Akademi University, Turku - Finland.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n ccii \n\nREFERENCES \n\n(1) Koskela, J P., Hormi, O.

T. Moutinho 207 \n\n10 CONCLUSIONS \n\nHaving already outlined the relevant aspects of each of the covered topics within the \n\nrespective chapters, the main conclusions to be drawn relate essentially to the integration \n\nand summary of these aspects. The major objective of this study was to analyze the \n\nalterations in physical and chemical properties of the paper surface caused by the \n\napplication of different surface sizing formulations (constituted by mixtures of cationic starch \n\nand minor quantities of distinct synthetic copolymers) and the impact of these physical and \n\nchemical alterations on the inkjet printing quality of uncoated fine papers. The use of these \n\nsurface sizing blends raised additional difficulties due to the lack of information about the \n\nchemical composition and structure of the copolymers, since these were industrial products \n\nand the only information available was basically about the monomers that constituted each \n\ncopolymer. A trial and error procedure was then implemented to determine the monomers \n\nproportion. This was based on the comparison between the elements ratios calculated from a \n\nprevious estimation and those measured by elemental analysis. Knowing the chemical \n\ncomposition, a schematic representation of the molecules structure was then proposed and \n\nvalidated by additional measurements of the compounds properties, such as particle size \n\nand surface tension.  \n\nThe different surface sizing formulations were applied to the paper sheets (? 3.5 g/m2) and \n\nsome surface properties of the treated papers were determined using distinct techniques \n\n(some of them not routinely used for paper surfaces). The differences between the results \n\nwere explained in terms of composition of the corresponding copolymers used and their \n\nquantities. Having in mind that the surface sizing is only a small percentage of a printing and \n\nwriting paper composition, that the variation of the applied sizing formulations was only in \n\nthe amount of copolymer added (20% at most, in order to be not far from the industrial \n\npractice) and also that some of the copolymers had identical composition, the initial \n\nexpectation was for relatively small magnitude effects. Thus, and in order to guarantee that \n\nthe differences between the samples were statistically valid, an analysis of variance was \n\nconsistently applied to all the results of the various surface characterization techniques. \n\nThe results obtained can be divided in two major groups: those related to the physical \n\nproperties of the paper sheets (surface roughness and porosity) and those related to their \n\nchemical characteristics (surface free energy, dispersive and polar components, and acid-\n\nbase character).  \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 208 \n\nRegarding the 3D topographical parameters measured by laser profilometry, it was shown \n\nthat the surfaces are moderately rough with a predominance of valleys over peaks. With \n\nrespect to porosity, mercury porosimetry has shown that a value around 56% was found for \n\npractically all samples. Additionally, the pore sizes exhibited a bimodal distribution with one \n\npeak around 3 \u00b5m and another around 20 \u00b5m. The increase in the quantity of copolymer \n\nincorporated in the blend led to a slight decrease in both porosity and pore size. In general, \n\nit can be concluded that no significant changes were induced by the distinct sizing blends in \n\nterms of surface roughness and paper porosity. As mentioned above, this is a logical \n\nconsequence of the surface sizing treatment, since only small amounts of sizing were applied \n\nwhich in turn differed only in even smaller quantities of incorporated copolymers. \n\nNonetheless, complementary studies carried out with AFM for some of the samples enabled \n\nto resolve small details on the paper surface allowing to detect differences in the size, shape \n\nand spatial distribution of the surface sizing agents\u2019 molecules at the paper surface.  \n\nContrary to the results obtained in terms of surface topography, the differences in the \n\ncomposition of the surface sizing blends had a relevant impact on the chemical properties of \n\nthe paper surface, as measured by contact angle and inverse gas chromatography. With \n\nrespect to the contact angle, both static and dynamic measurements were undertaken.  A \n\npreliminary study of paper topography\u2019s influence revealed that surface roughness does not \n\nsignificantly affect the contact angle values of the tested samples. As expected, the addition \n\nof the copolymers to the cationic starch increased paper surface hydrophobicity in different \n\ndegrees according to the respective composition and concentration. As for the derived \n\nsurface energetics results, it was shown that the P&amp;W papers\u2019 surface is predominantly \n\ndispersive, meaning that the polar and acid-base interactions have a smaller influence on \n\npaper behavior. However, these secondary interactions allow detailing the influence of the \n\nsurface modifications, since they are more specific than the dispersive ones. In fact, the values \n\nof the polar component of the surface free energy obtained for different copolymer \n\nconcentrations enabled to present solid hypotheses concerning the orientation of the \n\nmolecules at the paper surface, namely regarding the different functional groups. \n\nAdditionally, the dynamic contact angle measurements carried out with water to analyze the \n\nwetting behavior have confirmed some of these hypotheses and revealed that the addition \n\nof the synthetic surface sizing agents has an effect of controlling the wetting phenomena, \n\nboth in terms of spreading and absorption. \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 209 \n\nThe IGC analysis of the dispersive interactions has not only confirmed but in some cases also \n\ncomplemented the hypotheses raised for the molecules\u2019 orientation based on the contact \n\nangle measurements. Furthermore, it was verified that the paper\u2019s dispersive component of \n\nthe surface free energy decreases as the temperature increases and that the values derived \n\nfrom IGC are always above the ones determined from contact angle measurements, due to \n\nthe specificities of the techniques. As for the acid-base character it was found that the paper \n\nsurface is amphoteric with a slightly basic character (Kb values always higher than those of \n\nKa) and that the addition of the synthetic surface sizing agents to the traditional sizing \n\nformulation increases the surface ability to establish acid-base interactions due to a general \n\nincrease of Ka and Kb values (more relevant for Kb).  \n\nFrom the results of both contact angle and IGC measurements, it was possible to find out that, \n\nin general, styrene based surface sizing agents induce more consistent and logical variations, \n\nassociated to the chemical properties of the compounds. As for the distribution of the surface \n\nsizing agents on the surface, it was verified that they stay at the paper surface in layers, and \n\nthe amount necessary to complete each layer depends on the size of the copolymer \n\nmolecules. Moreover, the functional groups of the sizing agent turned towards the air \n\ninterface are those that mostly influence the paper surface properties.  \n\nComplementary studies using ESCA and ToF-SIMS undertaken for some of the paper samples \n\nenabled not only to confirm the above findings but also to detect differences in the \n\npenetration of the copolymer particles into the paper structure, explained as a result of \n\ndistinct copolymer surface tensions. Furthermore, the use of these techniques has shown that \n\nthe increase of the sizing pick-up (up to 9.0 g/m2) does not significantly change the chemical \n\nproperties of the paper surfaces. \n\nThe final inkjet printing performance, evaluated through the determination of several \n\nparameters related to color reproduction and image definition (as measured by optical \n\ndensities, gamut area and gain),  has shown that the surface sizing agents including styrene \n\nproved to be, in general, more successful than the remaining sizing agents tested.  \n\nRegarding the surface sizing agents\u2019 molecules orientation, it was confirmed that for better \n\ninkjet printing performances the predominance of non-polar rather than polar groups turned \n\noutwards is desirable. However the predominance of these polar groups can not be \n\nexcessive since they must also be accessible for paper-ink interactions in order to allow the \n\nink to dry fast. \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 210 \n\nAs for the subjective evaluation of the inkjet printing quality performed by a panel of end-\n\nusers, it was verified that the human perception of quality in a printed image is more \n\nassociated to parameters related with color reproduction quality (optical densities and \n\ngamut area) than parameters reporting image definition (gain). \n\nFrom all the available results, it can be concluded that the techniques used to analyze the \n\npaper surface seem to be more sensitive to differences in the sizing blend formulations than \n\nthose specifically used to evaluate inkjet printing quality. This leads to the conclusion that the \n\nfinal printing performance is clearly under-evaluated with the existing techniques. \n\nNonetheless, the results point to some recommended windows for the values of key variables \n\nthat potentiate a good printing quality:  \n\n75\u00ba &lt;water contact angle &lt;85\u00ba; \n\n0.09\u00ba/sec &lt;wetting velocity &lt;0.19\u00ba/sec \n\n6 mN/m &lt;polar component of the surface free energy &lt;12 mN/m \n\nFinally, in the total set of samples, those with an overall better performance are samples \n\nStS9-05 and StS10-10, which include co-styrene-acrylate copolymers in the sizing blend.  \n\n  \n\n \n\nAdditionally, the work developed throughout these years and the results that were obtained \n\nsuggest some further studies in order to better understand the interactions ruling the printing \n\nprocess and the sizing agents\u2019 influence on inkjet printability of uncoated fine papers. \n\nA deeper chemical characterization of the industrial compounds used in papermaking, taking \n\nadvantage of polymer chemistry, computational analysis and reversing engineering, would \n\nbe of utmost interest and usefulness. \n\nIn spite of the fact that the methodology used for the surface sizing operation in the \n\nlaboratory was quite reliable and sufficient to fulfil the objectives of the study, the \n\nknowledge of other variables involved in the process such as the temperature and \n\nrheological properties of the sizing formulations as well as the room temperature would be \n\nhelpful to better characterize the sizing process. \n\nThe delamination of the treated paper samples and the subsequent analysis of the distinct \n\nlayers both by SEM and FT-IR would contribute to a deeper insight on the effect of the \n\nsurface sizing process and of the absorption and spreading of inks. \n\n\n\n                           Physical &amp; Chemical Interactions on Paper Surface \u2013 Impact on the Printability of Papers Produced with E. globulus Kraft Pulps   \n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n\nIsabel M. T. Moutinho 211 \n\nBased on the results that were obtained with some of the copolymers, the use of tailor-made \n\nsizing agents containing styrene would also provide a deeper insight on the interactions \n\noccurring at paper surface. A larger variability in the composition of the surface sizing \n\nformulations in terms of the percentage of surface sizing agent is also recommended, to \n\nbetter understand the influence of each compound. \n\nFinally,  and in order to obtain printing quality results with a detail close to that provided by \n\nthe techniques used for the surface characterization, further developments in specific \n\ntechniques to evaluate printing parameters are mandatory.
