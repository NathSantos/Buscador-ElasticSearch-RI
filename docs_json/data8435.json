Muitos estudos epidemiol\u00f3gicos t\u00eam \nencontrado diferen\u00e7as regionais entre ambientes interiores. Apesar da elevada \nincid\u00eancia de asma e rinite na popula\u00e7\u00e3o infantil, praticamente nada se sabia \nsobre a QAI em escolas portuguesas. A percep\u00e7\u00e3o dos problemas de QAI \u00e9 \ncrucial para avaliar os riscos para a sa\u00fade e rendimento dos estudantes, e \npara sugerir meios de reduzir a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a poluentes indesej\u00e1veis. Neste \nestudo procurou-se obter as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de poluentes de interesse em \nestabelecimentos de ensino do 1\u00ba ciclo de Lisboa e Aveiro, estimar o estado \natual de casos de asma e rinite em escolas prim\u00e1rias da capital, avaliar a \ninflu\u00eancia de diferentes materiais das salas de aula/constru\u00e7\u00e3o e h\u00e1bitos \nescolares na QAI, identificar potenciais fontes de poluentes nos interiores e \nexteriores das salas de aula e propor medidas mitigadoras. Catorze escolas de \nLisboa foram visitadas para obter a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica das constru\u00e7\u00f5es em \ntermos de estrutura, ventila\u00e7\u00e3o, materiais de acabamento, produtos de \nlimpeza, densidade de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o e potenciais fontes interiores de polui\u00e7\u00e3o. Os \nestudantes foram questionados sobre os seus h\u00e1bitos e sintomas respirat\u00f3rios \natrav\u00e9s de inqu\u00e9ritos do modelo ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and \nAllergies in Childhood). Durante a primavera, outono e inverno (2008-2010), \nnas salas de aula e p\u00e1tios, foram monitorizados, por amostragem passiva, \ncompostos org\u00e2nicos vol\u00e1teis (COVs), carbonilos e di\u00f3xido de azoto (NO2).\nForam tamb\u00e9m medidos par\u00e2metros de conforto e n\u00edveis de microrganismos. \nDuas escolas localizadas, uma no centro da cidade e outra na regi\u00e3o \nsuburbana, em Aveiro foram estudadas em 2010. Par\u00e2metros de conforto, \nmicrorganismos, COVs, NO2, material particulado (PM10) foram medidos no \ninterior e no exterior de ambas escolas. Os i\u00f5es sol\u00faveis, carbono org\u00e2nico e \nelementar (OC e EC), e compostos org\u00e2nicos presentes no material \nparticulado foram subsequentemente analisados em laborat\u00f3rio. Uma medida \nmitigadora - fitoremedia\u00e7\u00e3o - foi avaliada na escola do centro da cidade de \nAveiro em 2011. Os resultados do estudo mostraram que a QAI \u00e9 pior do que a \ndo ar exterior. Em geral, os n\u00edveis de CO2 e dos bioaeros\u00f3is excederam os \nn\u00edveis m\u00e1ximos aceit\u00e1veis para o conforto dos ocupantes estipulado pelas \nregulamenta\u00e7\u00f5es portuguesas. Quase todos os COVs e carbonilos \nidentificados mostraram raz\u00f5es interior/exterior (I/E) maiores que uma unidade, \no que demonstra a importante contribui\u00e7\u00e3o de fontes interiores em todas as \nescolas. As raz\u00f5es I/E das concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de NO2 nunca excederam a \nunidade. Os n\u00edveis interiores di\u00e1rios de PM10 foram sempre maiores que os \nexteriores, exceto nos fins de semana. Ap\u00f3s a coloca\u00e7\u00e3o de plantas numa das\nsalas de aula, observou-se uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o estatisticamente significativa nos \nn\u00edveis de CO2, COVs, carbonilos, PM10, OC, e dos i\u00f5es nitrato, sulfato, am\u00f3nia, \nc\u00e1lcio e carbonato. A poss\u00edvel redu\u00e7\u00e3o dos n\u00edveis de poluentes no interior ap\u00f3s \na coloca\u00e7\u00e3o de plantas pode representar uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o de baixo custo para \nreduzir a exposi\u00e7\u00e3o a muitos compostos, melhorar o rendimento e aumentar o \nbem estar dos alunos e professores em sala de aula. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n  \n\nKeywords \n \n\nindoor air quality, VOCs, carbonyls, NO2, CO2, PM10, school \n  \n \n\nAbstract \n \n\nThere is a growing concern about indoor air quality (IAQ) in schools in many \ncountries. Most epidemiological studies have found significant differences \namong indoor environments from different regions. Despite the high incidence\nof asthma and rhinitis in children, virtually nothing was known about the IAQ in\nPortuguese schools. The perception of IAQ problems is crucial to assess health \nrisks and students\u2019 performance, and to suggest ways to reduce the exposure \nof children to undesirable pollutants. The main purpose of this study was to \nobtain the concentrations of pollutants of interest in Lisbon and Aveiro schools,\nto estimate the actual state for asthma/rhinitis in Lisbon\u2019s primary school \npopulation, to evaluate the influence of outdoor environment on indoor air, to \nevaluate the influence of different classroom/building materials and school \nhabits on IAQ, to evaluate the relevance of both indoor and outdoor air quality \nto the incidence of respiratory symptoms and students\u2019 performance, to identify \npotential outdoor/indoor pollutant sources, and to propose mitigation measures.\nFourteen schools of Lisbon city were visited to obtain the physical \ncharacterisation of the buildings in terms of structure, ventilation, furniture \nmaterials, cleaning products, occupant density, and potential indoor pollutant \nsources. Students were questioned about habits and respiratory symptoms\nthrough ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) \nsurveys. During spring, autumn and winter seasons (2008-2010), classrooms \nand playgrounds were monitored by volatile organic compound (VOC),\ncarbonyl and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) passive sampling. Comfort parameters and \nmicroorganisms were also measured. Two schools located in Aveiro, one at the \ncity centre and another on the outskirts of the city, were the target of the study\nin 2010. Comfort parameters, microorganisms, VOCs, NO2 and particulate \nmatter (PM10) were measured inside and outside of both schools. The soluble \nions, organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) and organic compounds in \nparticulate matter were subsequently analysed in the laboratory. A mitigation \nmeasure \u2013 phytoremediation - was evaluated at the city centre Aveiro school in \n2011. The results of this study showed that IAQ is worse than outdoor air. \nGenerally, the CO2 and bioaerosol levels were higher than the acceptable \nmaximum values stipulated by the Portuguese regulations. Almost all identified \nVOCs and carbonyls showed indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios higher than one, which \ndenotes an important contribution from indoor sources at all schools. In \ngeneral, the I/O NO2 ratios never exceeded the unity. The daily indoor PM10\nlevels were always higher than those outdoors, except on weekends. After the \nplacement of potted-plants in one classroom, a statistically significant reduction \nin the levels of CO2, VOCs, carbonyls, PM10, organic carbon, and ions (nitrate, \nsulphate, ammonia, calcium, and carbonate) was observed. The use of plants \nmay represent a low-cost solution to reduce exposure to many compounds and \nlifetime risk, and to further improve performance, attendance and welfare of \nstudents and teachers in classrooms. \n \n\n \n\n\n\n i \n\n \n\nIndex \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter 1 ____________________________________________________1 \n\n1.

INTRODUCTION \n \n \n\n1.1 Indoor air quality \n\n \n\n Indoor air quality (IAQ) in enclosed spaces depends on several factors, including \n\nthermal, acoustic and visual comfort. Both physical and perceptual parameters are \n\nimportant in defining a good indoor environment. The IAQ may have a significant \n\ninfluence on health, welfare and comfort of occupants, which may impact the performance \n\nand productivity (Daisey et al., 2003; Paevere et al., 2008; Simoni et al., 2010; Viegi et al,. \n\n2004). The IAQ is determined by a constant interaction of factors that affect the types, \n\nlevels and importance of pollutants inside the building. In closed environments, IAQ can \n\nbe related to several causes either chemical (e.g. carbon oxides, environmental tobacco \n\nsmoke, formaldehyde, and volatile organic compounds) (Bakke et al., 2008; Dales et al., \n\n2008; Giulio et al., 2010; OSHA, 2011) or physical (ventilation rate, dampness, \n\ntemperature, and non-ionising and ionising radiation) (Bakke et al., 2008; Giulio et al., \n\n2010; OSHA, 2011). In addition, IAQ is also related to bioaerosols (bacteria, virus, fungi, \n\nand toxins from microbial metabolism) (Douwes et al., 2003; Giulio et al., 2010; OSHA, \n\n2011). \n\n Indoor air pollution is the second most important environmental risk factor, after \n\nunsafe water. It accounts for twice the number of deaths reported from urban outdoor air \n\npollution (Singh and Jamal, 2012). An acceptable IAQ is defined as air without \n\ncontaminants at harmful levels and where the majority of people are satisfied. The IAQ \n\ndepends on both the outdoor air quality and on the emissions of indoor sources. Thus, it is \n\nnecessary an entrance of tempered outdoor air and a sufficient quantity of clean air \n\n(Amissah, 2005). However, each indoor microenvironment is uniquely characterised, and it \n\ndepends on the outdoor air, specific buildings characteristics and indoor activities (Giulio \n\net al., 2010; Stranger et al., 2007).  \n\n The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (1999) has classified IAQ among the \n\ntop five environmental risks to public health. The IAQ is characterised by physical factors \n\n\n\n 4 \n\n(ambient temperature, humidity, ventilation rate, for example), air pollutant factors \n\n(pollutant levels and exposure times) and human factors (activities and health status) \n\n(Bakke et al., 2008; Dales et al., 2008; Giulio et al., 2010; OSHA, 2011; Paevere et al., \n\n2008). Other factors that contribute negatively to IAQ are poor cleaning practises, poor \n\nmoisture control (water leaks or damp surfaces), human occupancy (odours, respiration) \n\nand poor building maintenance (Mi et al., 2006; OSHA, 2011; Paevere et al., 2008; \n\nSalonvaara et al., 2004; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1999). The modern \n\nconstruction with better insulation may result in warmer buildings, but more humid houses \n\nwith poorer availability of fresh air by the ventilation (J\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m et al., 2006; Jones, 2000). \n\nLow ventilation rates have been associated with several health problems, respiratory \n\nallergies and asthma, like sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms (Daisey et al., 2003; \n\nFraga et al., 2008; Godwin and Batterman, 2007; Griffiths and Eftekhari, 2008; Kim et al., \n\n2007a; Mi et al., 2006; Seppanen et al., 1999; Shaughnessy et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2009). \n\nSBS is a situation in which occupants experience health effects (of mucosal, skin, and \n\ngeneral symptoms) that seem to be linked to time spent in a building, but no specific illness \n\nor cause can be identified. The complaints may be localised in a particular room or zone, or \n\nmay be widespread throughout the building. These symptoms include headaches, eye, \n\nnose, and throat irritation, a dry cough, dry or itchy skin, dizziness and nausea, difficulty in \n\nconcentrating, fatigue, and sensitivity to odours. SBS reduces work performance and may \n\nalso decrease the attendance (Burge, 2004; Daisey et al., 2003; Fang et al., 2004; Li and \n\nYang, 2004; Rashid and Zimring, 2008; Syazwan et al., 2009; U.S. Environmental \n\nProtection Agency, 1999; WHO, 2009). \n\n In recent years there has been increased interest in indoor pollutants because \n\ncitizens spend more time (about 90%) inside buildings and many studies have showed \n\nhigher levels inside than outside (Godoi et al., 2009; Jo and Seo, 2005; Kotzias et al., 2009; \n\nLee and Chang, 2000; Lee et al. 2001, 2002, Li et al. 2001; Pegas et al., 2010; Pegas et al., \n\n2011a,b; Yang et al., 2009) \n\n Indoor pollution sources are the primary cause of a bad IAQ. Insufficient \n\nventilation can exacerbate the IAQ problems, since there is not adequate air renewal to \n\ndilute the indoor pollutant concentrations and there is not a removal of indoor pollutants to \n\nthe outside (Daisey et al., 2003; Griffiths and Eftekhari, 2008; Mi et al., 2006). High \n\n\n\n 5 \n\ntemperatures and humidity may also increase levels of chemical compounds and bioaerosol \n\n(Burge, 2004; Li and Yang, 2004; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2008). \n\nThe main indoor sources include combustion sources (oil, gas, kerosene, coal, \n\nwood, and tobacco products), building materials and furniture (both new and deteriorated), \n\nasbestos (used in insulation), carpet, hardwood, plywood, wall paneling, particleboard, \n\nfiberboard, paints, paint strippers, and other solvents, wood preservatives, aerosol sprays, \n\ncleansers and disinfectants, moth repellents and air fresheners, stored fuels and automotive \n\nproducts, hobby supplies, dry-cleaned clothing, central heating and cooling systems and \n\nhumidification devices (Cer\u00f3n et al., 2007; Daisey et al., 2003, Guo et al., 2004, Mendell, \n\n2007; Ugucione et al., 2009; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2008). In some cases, \n\nthe age of a specific source and its conservation status may increase or decrease emissions \n\nand pollutants that are emitted (J\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2009). Moreover, the \n\nemissions are variable in length over time. For example, building materials, architectural \n\nfinishes and furniture release pollutants more or less continuously, while cleaning and \n\nhobby activities, kerosene and gas space heaters, woodstoves, fireplaces, and gas stoves \n\nrelease pollutants intermittently. Changes in construction designs in order to conserve \n\nenergy (higher heat and sound insulation, for example) and the increasing application of \n\nsynthetic products have contributed to the enhancement of the number of complaints about \n\nIAQ at several environments (J\u00e4rnstr\u00f6m et al., 2006; Sundell et al., 1994; Yang et al., \n\n2004). The application of insulation and energy efficiency measurements has a negative \n\neffect on air renovation causing the accumulation of harmful compounds to human health \n\n(Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente, 2009; Brickus and Aquino-Neto, 1999). \n\nHealth effects from a poor IAQ may be experienced during exposure or, possibly, \n\nyears later. Most pollutants to which people are exposed indoors constitute an additional \n\nrisk factor in the development of several pathologies (Daisey et al., 2003; Mendell, 2007; \n\nSimoni et al., 2010; Singh and Jamal, 2012; Sundell et al., 1994). Immediate effects \n\ninclude eyes, nose, and throat irritation, allergic rhinitis, flu-like symptoms, headaches, \n\ndifficulty in concentration, fatigue, dry or itchy skin, difficulty in breathing and nausea \n\nfeeling sick. Symptoms of some diseases, including asthma, wheezing, rhinitis and hay \n\nfever, may be aggravated by exposure to pollutants (Daisey et al., 2003; Mendell, 2007; \n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2008). Long term-effects include respiratory \n\n\n\n 6 \n\ndiseases, heart disease, and cancer, which can lead to death (Bernstein et al., 2008; \n\nGuieysse et al., 2008; Jie et al., 2011; Rios et al.; 2009; Samet and Spengler, 2003). \n\n \n\n1.2 Guidelines for indoor air quality \n\n \n\n Many of the regulations for IAQ are incomplete and fragmented. Some institutions \n\nor groups have introduced general specifications and/or guidance notes addressing IAQ \n\nissues. This section tries to summarise some recommendations for acceptable indoor air \n\nquality levels for the main indoor pollutants, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon \n\nmonoxide (CO), particle matter &lt;2.5 \u00b5 m (PM2.5), particle matter &lt;10\u00b5 m (PM10), ozone \n\n(O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), microorganisms, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), \n\nformaldehyde, and polycyclic aromatics hydrocarbons (PAHs). \n\nIn the United States of America, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 \n\ncreated both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National \n\nInstitute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). OSHA was created to assure safe \n\nand healthful working conditions. The standards were developed through a formal rule-\n\nmaking process, and the limits can only be changed by reopening this process. It does have \n\nstandards about ventilation and standards on some of the air contaminants that can be \n\ninvolved in IAQ problems. NIOSH is the federal agency responsible for researches and \n\nrecommendations for the prevention of work-related injury and illness. It helps to assure \n\nsafe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by providing research, \n\ninformation, education, and training in the field of occupational safety and health. It \n\nrecommended maximum exposures for industrial environments, but these \n\nrecommendations are not reviewed regularly, and in some cases levels are set above those \n\nneeded for health reasons, because commonly available industrial hygiene practices do not \n\nreliably detect substances at lower levels. Also created in 1970 in the USA, the \n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA) is an organisation of the federal government \n\nwhich was created with the purpose of protecting human health and the environment by \n\nwriting and enforcing regulations. EPA does not have regulations or standards related to \n\nIAQ, but has been developing guidance documents. The National Ambient Air Quality \n\n\n\n 7 \n\nStandards (NAAQS) developed by EPA have standards for outdoor air quality, but they are \n\nalso applicable to indoor air contaminant levels. The concentrations are set conservatively \n\nin order to protect the most sensitive individuals, such children, the elderly, and those with \n\nasthma. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers \n\n(ASHRAE) in its documents \u201cVentilation for Acceptable Indoor Air Quality\u201d (ASHRAE \n\n62-2001) and \u201cThermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy\u201d (ASHRAE 55-\n\n2004) promulgated standards, which are currently adopted not only in the USA, but also in \n\nother regions of the world. The American Council of Governmental Industrial Hygienists \n\n(ACGIH) is a member-based organisation dedicated to the industrial hygiene and \n\noccupational health and safety industries. Their guidelines are applicable for normal \n\nindustrial working conditions (40 hours per week), and for single contaminant exposure. \n\nThese recommendations are guidelines, rather than enforceable standards, and are not \n\nselected to protect the most sensitive people. These guidelines were developed in 1987 and \n\nupdated in 1999. They are intended for application to both indoor and outdoor exposures, \n\nbut are guidelines rather than an enforceable standard. The Canadian Occupational Safety \n\nand Health Regulations (COSHR) established requirements for maintaining a healthy and \n\nsafe working environment. COSHR requires that indoor contaminant concentrations be \n\nkept within the limits set by the ACGIH. The World Health Organisation (WHO) Office \n\nfor Europe, based in Denmark, developed guidelines to be used in non-industrial settings.  \n\nThe Portuguese Legislation lays on some rules for IAQ, defined by the National \n\nSystem for Energy and Indoor Air Quality Certification of Buildings (Regulamento dos \n\nSistemas Energ\u00e9ticos de Climatiza\u00e7\u00e3o de Edif\u00edcios - RSECE, Decree-Laws 78/2006 and \n\n79/2006). This set of laws establishes a technical note with the methodology to the audit of \n\nIAQ in buildings. To perform an audit, the following tasks are necessary: i) gathering all \n\nrelevant information about the building (plans, description of the ventilation system, \n\nspecial areas, number of occupants, registration of complaints and symptoms); ii) \n\npreliminary visit to the building (verify the accuracy and update the information given by \n\nthe owner, gather additional information, interviews with occupants); iii) check the CO2 \n\nlevels inside and outside the building (near the air intakes, like windows, balconies or \n\nexternal openings of the ventilation system); and iv) pre-assessment of hygiene and \n\nmaintenance of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, when it exists \n\n(RSECE, 2006). \n\n\n\n 8 \n\n PM10 represent particles of any substances that are less than or equal to 10 \n\nmicrometres diameter. Particles in this size range make up a large proportion of dust that \n\ncan be drawn deep into the lungs. Respirable particulate matter is released from a wide \n\nrange of biogenic and anthopogenic sources. Continuous exposure to PM10 contributes to \n\nthe risk of developing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as of lung cancer \n\n(Sloan et al., 2012). The World Health Organisation has set a guideline of 20 \u00b5g m-3 for the \n\nannual mean. A threshold of 150 \u00b5g m-3 for indoor PM10 without a temporal base has been \n\nestablished by the Portuguese Legislation (RSECE, 2006).  \n\nIndoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the adequacy of outdoor air ventilation \n\nrelative to indoor environment. The National System for Energy and Indoor Air Quality \n\nCertification of Buildings establishes an acceptable maximum value of 1800 mg m-3 of \n\nCO2 for buildings in Portugal (RSECE, 2006). This measurement is useful to know if the \n\nconfined space meets reference concentration to ensure the welfare of the occupants and \n\ncomply with the ventilation rates recommended by RSECE (8.33 l s-1 per person). The \n\nminimum value recommended by the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62-1999 is only 2.5 l s-1 \n\nper person.  \n\nAcute exposure to CO, a pollutant resulting from combustion processes, is related \n\nto reduction of exercise tolerance and increase in symptoms of ischaemic heart disease \n\n(WHO, 2009). At lower levels of exposure, CO causes mild effects that are often mistaken \n\nfor the flu. These symptoms include headaches, dizziness, disorientation, nausea and \n\nfatigue. The effects of CO exposure can vary greatly from person to person depending on \n\nage, overall health and the concentration and length of exposure. While the WHO has sets \n\nlimits for CO concentrations in accordance with the exposure period, RSECE only \n\nestablishes an acceptable maximum value.  \n\nOzone at ground level is formed by the reaction in the presence of sunlight \n\n(photochemical reaction) of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) from vehicle and \n\nindustry emissions and biogenic VOCs or emitted by vehicles, solvents and industry. The \n\nhighest levels of ozone pollution occur during periods of sunny weather. High ozone \n\nconcentrations may cause breathing problems, trigger asthma, reduce lung function and \n\ncause lung diseases (WHO, 2010). The Portuguese legislation establishes a limit of 200 \u00b5g \n\nm-3 without specifying further conditions for ozone exposure.  \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nFormaldehyde is, in general, the most abundant carbonyl compound in indoor air. \n\nThis volatile compound is released from a variety of sources, including building materials, \n\nconsumer products and furniture. It is classified as a human carcinogen by the International \n\nAgency for Cancer Research (IARC). Exposure to moderate levels of formaldehyde \n\n(hundreds of ppb or greater) can cause a number of irritant symptoms, including temporary \n\nburning of the eyes or nose, and a sore throat. RSECE has set a limit of 0.1 mg m-3 without \n\nfurther information about the duration of exposure (RSECE, 2006). The formaldehyde \n\nguideline (30 min average) recommended by WHO was target in order to prevent effects \n\non lung functions, as well as nasopharyngeal cancer and myeloid leukaemia (WHO, 2009). \n\nAmong all VOCs, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) are of \n\nparticular interest due to their known carcinogenic effects. It has been demonstrated that \n\nvehicular emissions and industrial sources are the major sources of ambient BTEX, while \n\nthe indoor sources are quite numerous (e.g. combustion by-products, cooking, construction \n\nmaterials, furnishings, paints, varnishes and solvents). Benzene is a genotoxic carcinogen \n\nin humans and, according to WHO, no safe level of exposure can be recommended. The \n\nrisk of toxicity from inhaled benzene would be the same whether the exposure were \n\nindoors or outdoors. Thus there is no reason that the guidelines for indoor air should differ \n\nfrom ambient air guidelines (WHO, 2010). RSECE establishes a target of 600 \u00b5g m-3 for \n\ntotal VOCs in indoor environments (RSECE, 2006).  \n\nAlso among VOCs, chlorinated compounds (e.g. trichloroethylene and \n\ntetrachloroethylene) have received increasing attention. Trichloroethylene (TCE) is \n\nprimarily used as a solvent to remove grease from metal parts. As a solvent or as a \n\ncomponent of solvent blends, it is used in adhesives, lubricants, paints, varnishes, paint \n\nstrippers, carpet shampoos and waterproofing agents. Consumers may be exposed to \n\ntrichloroethylene when using products containing the substance, especially if there is not \n\ngood ventilation. Because TCE is used in many consumer products, short-term indoor \n\nconcentrations may be elevated above the levels considered safe. Exposure to moderate \n\namounts of TCE may cause headaches, loss of balance, and tremors. Larger exposures will \n\ncause dizziness or sleepiness, and at very high levels may cause unconsciousness. Very \n\nlarge exposures may cause irreversible cardiac problems, nerve and liver damage, and \n\ndeath. TCE is mildly irritating to the eyes, nose and throat. Chronic (long-term) exposures \n\n\n\n 10 \n\nto TCE have been shown to cause nausea, intolerance to fatty foods, respiratory irritation, \n\nrenal (kidney) toxicity, and immune system depression (DSEWPC, 2001). IARC has \n\nclassified TCE as a probable human carcinogen. WHO (2010) reported an unit risk \n\nestimate of 4.3 \u00d7 10\u20137 per \u00b5g m-3. The concentrations of airborne TCE associated with an \n\nexcess lifetime cancer risk of 1:10 000, 1:100 000 and 1:1 000 000 are respectively 230, 23 \n\nand 2.3 \u00b5g m-3 (WHO, 2010). Tetrachloroethylene, also known as perchloroethylene \n\n(PERC), is used in the dry-cleaning industry. It can be added to solvent soaps, printing \n\ninks, adhesives, sealants, polishes, lubricants and silicones. Consumers may be exposed to \n\nPERC when using consumer products containing the compound, by spending time in dry-\n\ncleaning facilities or by bringing dry-cleaned clothes into their homes. In high \n\nconcentrations, in air, with closed or poorly ventilated areas, single exposures to PERC \n\nmay cause central nervous system effects (DSEWPC, 2001). PERC was classified as a \n\nprobable human carcinogen by IARC. Carcinogenicity was not selected by WHO as the \n\nend-point for setting the guideline value for three reasons: the epidemiological evidence is \n\nequivocal, the animal tumours detected are not considered relevant to humans, and there \n\nare no indications that PERC is genotoxic. Based on studies of dry cleaning workers, the \n\nlowest level for which adverse effects on kidneys are observable after long-term exposure \n\nwas considered to be 102 mg m-3, while a minimal risk level of 0.28 mg m-3 has been \n\nestimated for chronic inhalations (WHO, 2010). Based on these outcomes, WHO set an \n\nannual average of 0.25 mg m-3. Naphthalene is the most volatile PAH. Most airborne \n\nemissions result from combustion, and key sources include industry, open burning, tailpipe \n\nemissions, and cigarettes. The second largest source is off-gassing, specifically from \n\nnaphthalene\u2019s use as a deodoriser, repellent and fumigant. Exposure to naphthalene has \n\nbeen linked to a number of adverse health effects. The major non-cancer endpoints are \n\nhyperplasia and metaplasia in respiratory and olfactory epithelium, respectively, and the \n\ncancer endpoint of concern are nasal tumors (Jia and Batterman, 2010). Is has been \n\nclassified as possibly carcinogenic to humans by IARC. A guideline of 0.01 mg m-3 \n\n(annual average) has been recommended by WHO. This value was assumed to prevent \n\npotential malignant effects in the airways.  \n\nPAHs are combustion products that constitute a large group of organic compounds \n\nwith two or more benzenic rings. Low-molecular-weight PAHs (two and three rings) occur \n\npredominatly in the vapour phase, whiles five or more ringed PAHs are largely bound to \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nparticles. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is often used as a marker for total exposure to \n\ncarcinogenic PAHs, as the contribution of B[a]P to the total carcinogenic potential is high. \n\nAccording to WHO (2010), no threshold can be determined and all indoor exposures are \n\nconsidered relevant to health. The unit risk for lung cancer for PAH mixtures is estimated \n\nto be 8.7 \u00d7 10\u20135 per ng m-3 of B[a]P. The corresponding concentrations for lifetime \n\nexposure to B[a]P producing excess lifetime cancer risks of 1/10 000, 1/100 000 and 1/1 \n\n000 000 are approximately 1.2, 0.12 and 0.012 ng m-3, respectively. \n\nNO2 is a pollutant associated with combustion sources. It is an irritant gas and can \n\nincrease susceptibility to airway infections and impair lung function in exposed \n\npopulations. Short-term human controlled exposure experimental studies indicated minor \n\nchanges in pulmonary function in people with asthma exposed to 560 \u00b5g m-3 nitrogen \n\ndioxide for up to 2\u00bd hours. Small increases in airway reactivity to a range of stimuli in \n\nasthmatics at repeated short exposures to 500 \u00b5g m-3 were also observed. Meta-analysis of \n\nstudies on association of lower respiratory illness in children showed that an increase in \n\nindoor nitrogen dioxide of 28 \u00b5g m-3 above the background of ca. 15 \u00b5g m-3 can be \n\nassociated with a 20% increased risk of lower respiratory illness in children (WHO, 2010). \n\nA 1-hour indoor nitrogen dioxide guideline of 200 \u00b5g m-3 was recommended by WHO. No \n\nstandard is provided in the Portuguese legislation. \n\n Bacteria found in indoor environments typically come from human sources (skin \n\nand respiration) or from the outdoors. Like mould, most of the bacteria found in the air in \n\nbuildings are saprobes, meaning they grow on dead organic matter. As far as building \n\nenvelopes are concerned the primary preoccupation is about bacteria colonies that may \n\ngrow in damp areas. Exposure to bacterial and mould may cause allergic reactions, asthma, \n\nand other respiratory complaints, excluding pathogenic bacteria that trigger specific \n\ndiseases. The Portuguese legislation establishes an indoor limit of 500 colony forming \n\nunits per cubic meter (CFU m-3) for the levels of both bacterial and fungal populations \n\n(RSECE, 2006).  \n\n A summary of IAQ guidelines for selected pollutants comparing RSECE, \n\nWHO/Europe, NAAQS/EPA, OSHA/ASHRAE, NIOSH, ACGIH and COSHR. is shown \n\nin Table 1.1. \n\n\n\n 12 \n\n \n\nTable 1.1. Summary of IAQ guidelines for selected pollutants: RSECE, WHO/Europe, \nNAAQS/EPA, OSHA/ASHRAE, NIOSH, ACGIH and COSHR. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 13 \n\n1.3 Indoor air quality in schools \n\n \n\n The increased traffic and industrial emissions caused an increased concern about \n\noutdoor air quality in the last 50 years. At the same time, studies have shown that citizens \n\nspend most of their time in buildings and are far more exposed to pollution indoors than \n\noutdoors (Blondeau et al., 2005; Rodrigues, 2008; Yu et al., 2009). Schools constitute a \n\nparticular indoor environment because children represent a special susceptible group of the \n\npopulation (Geller et al., 2007). In an extensive review work, Mendell and Heath (2005) \n\nconcluded that school IAQ need to be studied with the aim of finding connections between \n\npollutants and performance or attendance, due to two main reasons: schools normally have \n\nenvironmental deficiencies since chronic shortages of funding contribute to inadequate \n\noperation and maintenance of facilities; and children have greater susceptibility to \n\npollutants than adults because they breathe higher volumes of air relative to their body \n\nweights and their organs are actively growing. Moreover, children are less likely than \n\nadults to comprehend and clearly communicate their symptoms. \n\nLevels of specific contaminants in indoor air may be significantly higher than \n\noutdoors. Contaminants found at increased levels indoors include formaldehyde, VOCs, \n\nmoulds and bacteria, PM, CO, CO2 and NO2 (Godish, 1989). Many indoor sources can \n\ncontribute to indoor air pollution in a school, as shown in Figure 1.1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nFigure 1.1. Examples of indoor pollutant sources in a school. \n\n \n\nStudents, teachers, and other staff members need a healthy and comfortable indoor \n\nenvironment in schools, because poor IAQ may lead to discomfort or illness, which may \n\nreduce productivity, attendance and academic performance. The control of IAQ in a school \n\nis a special problem due to the fact that students and teachers often work more closely \n\ntogether in classrooms than people in typical office buildings. In addition, approximately \n\nfour times more people may occupy a given area of floor in a school classroom as than in \n\nan office (U.S.EPA, 1999). Thus, there is a growing concern about IAQ in schools in many \n\ncountries.  \n\nMost studies in schools have been performed in northern Europe (Kim et al., \n\n2007a,b; Zhao et al., 2006), USA (Godwin and Batterman, 2007; Shaughnessy et al., 2006) \n\nand China (Kim et al., 2007b, Mi et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2006). Significant differences \n\namong indoor environments from different regions have been found (Mi et al., 2006; Zhao \n\net al., 2006). Data are needed on air quality in schools, since children are assumed to be \n\nmore vulnerable to health hazards and spend a large part of their time in classrooms (Bayer \n\net al., 2000). \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nDaisey et al. (2003) compiled information about IAQ and health problems in \n\nschools. Generally, the CO2 concentrations in schools indicated inadequate air exchange \n\nrates, since the CO2 measurements (above 1000 ppm) do not meet the ASHRAE Standard \n\n62-1999 for minimum ventilation rate (Blondeau et al., 2005; Brennan et al., 1991; Casey \n\net al., 1995; Fisher et al., 1994; Fromme et al., 2007; Griffiths and Eftekhari, 2008; Lee \n\nand Chang, 2000; Madureira et al., 2009; Menzies et al., 1993; Milton et al., 2000; Nielsen \n\net al., 1984; Norback, 1995; Smedje et al., 1996, 1997; Thorne, 1993; Turk et al., 1987, \n\n1989, 1993; Willers et al., 1996). Fromme et al. (2007) performed a study in 64 schools in \n\nMunich and a neighbouring district outside the city boundary during the winter of 2004 \n\nand 2005 and found correlations between high CO2 levels, inadequate ventilation, \n\noccupancy rates and poor IAQ. The accumulations of pollutants and poor ventilation rates \n\nhave been related to asthma and allergies commonly reported by students and teachers \n\n(Bornehag et al., 2004, 2005; Seppanen et al., 1999; Sundell et al., 1994). Wargocki et al. \n\n(2000) observed that increasing ventilation decreased the percentage of subjects \n\ndissatisfied with the air quality and the intensity of odour, and increased the perceived \n\nfreshness of air. It also decreased the sensation of dryness of mouth and throat, eased \n\ndifficulty in thinking clearly and made subjects generally better.  \n\nChaloulakou and Mavroidis (2002) investigated indoor and outdoor CO \n\nconcentrations in Greek schools. The outdoor CO levels were higher than indoors. \n\nHowever, indoor CO concentrations were higher during winter than during summer, \n\nshowing a variation dependent on the season. Rundell et al. (2006) and Ali and Athar \n\n(2008) studied schools in different traffic locations and also found higher CO levels \n\noutdoor. On the other hand, Chen et al. (2000) reported an increase of 3.79% absence rate \n\nfor increases of 1 ppm in indoor CO concentrations, in elementary schools (Chen et al., \n\n2000). \n\nPersuasive evidence links higher indoor NO2 concentrations to reduced school \n\nattendance (Ali and Athar, 2008; Brunekreef et al., 1997; Janssen et al., 2001, 2003; Mi et \n\nal., 2006; Peacock et al., 2003; P\u00e9nard-Morand et al., 2005; Piloto et al., 1997; Singer et \n\nal., 2004; Van Roosbroeck et al., 2007; Wargocki and Wyon, 2007). A well-designed study \n\non the effects of emissions from gas heaters in both school and home settings reported a \n\n\n\n 16 \n\nsignificant dose-response relationship with increasing NO2 exposure for increased rates of \n\nsore throat, colds and absences from school (Pilotto et al., 1997). \n\nFew measurements of speciated VOCs in schools are reported in the literature. \n\nMost studies have been focused on total VOCs (Bayer and Dowing, 1992; Black and \n\nWorthan, 1995; Casey et al. 1995; Cavallo et al., 1993; Norback, 1995; Smedje et al., \n\n1996). Black and Worthan (1995) reported total VOC concentrations of 0.45 and 0.2 mg \n\nm-3 under occupied and unoccupied conditions for a school in Washington State. In two \n\nUS schools with humidity and mould problems, the total VOC levels ranged from 1 to 23 \n\nmg m-3 (Bayer and Dowing, 1992). A cross-sectional study in Swedish secondary schools \n\nperformed by Smedje et al. (1996) reported a loss in student performance due to IAQ \n\nproblems related to multiple indoor exposures and conditions, including the high \n\nconcentrations of total VOCs. Huang et al. (2008) measured indoor and outdoor \n\nconcentration of 82 VOCs in one elementary school in Beijing. They found that total \n\nVOCs were higher inside the school than at playgrounds. The chemical speciation of \n\nindoor VOCs was similar to the outdoor air. The most common species of VOCs found \n\nwere isopentane, benzene, propanal, propene and dichloromethane. Madureira et al. (2009) \n\ncharacterised the IAQ in Oporto schools to evaluate cases of health symptoms reported by \n\nteachers and to study the impact of pollutants on the prevalence of these symptoms. The \n\nresults showed that schools near heavy traffic roads had higher concentrations of benzene \n\nand toluene. In Turkish schools, Sofuoglu et al. (2011) evaluated VOCs indoors and \n\noutdoors. Benzene and toluene were the most abundant compounds, followed by \n\nnaphthalene and xylenes.  \n\nTwo controlled exposure studies evaluated the effects of a mixture of 22 VOCs on \n\nsick-building syndrome patients relative to asymptomatic controls (Kjaergaard et al., 1991; \n\nM?lhave et al., 1986). Along with increasing symptom reports of irritation with increasing \n\nVOC exposure (0, 5, 25 mg m-3), M?lhave et al. (1986) reported reduced performance on \n\ndigit span among SBS subjects. This finding was not replicated, however, when this study \n\nwas conducted with young, healthy male subjects. Kjaergaard et al. (1991) also found \n\nimpaired digit span performance in SBS-sensitive subjects but not among non-SBS \n\nsubjects with exposure at 25 mg m-3 VOC mixture, which is roughly equivalent to 7 ppm \n\ntoluene. Otto et al. (1992) suggested that differential effects may be due to differential \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nsensitivity of the subject groups as well as relative insensitivity of many of the current \n\nneurobehavioural methods. Nasal swelling, congestion, inflammation, irritant symptoms \n\n(nose, throat, eyes and skin) and other symptoms typical of SBS are related to VOC \n\nexposure (Gyntelberg et al., 1994; Madureira et al., 2009; M?lhave et al., 1986; Sundell et \n\nal., 1993; Willers et al., 1996). \n\nThe first measurements of formaldehyde in schools were reported by Olsen and \n\nDossing (1982). They measured formaldehyde in 10 Danish daycares centres. The average \n\nformaldehyde concentration for mobile buildings was 0.35 ppm, while the level for \n\npermanent buildings was 0.065 ppm. Health symptoms were three times more frequent \n\namong the staff in the mobile buildings than permanent buildings. Black and Worthan \n\n(1995) reported formaldehyde concentrations of 0.01 ppm e before and during occupancy \n\nin a complaint school of Washington State after the adoption of mitigation measures. \n\nFormaldehyde concentrations for 10 schools in Milan, Italy (Cavallo et al., 1993) and 10 \n\nschools in Paris, France (Laurent et al., 1993) were at or near 0.05 ppm. Both studies \n\nreported a relationship between irritation and formaldehyde exposure. High concentrations \n\nof formaldehyde were related to a significant prejudice in mental performance in 627 \n\nSwedish secondary school students (Smedje et al., 1996). Sodr\u00e9 et al. (2008) evaluated the \n\nmain carbonyls at indoor public spaces, including 6 classrooms. Formaldehyde levels \n\nranged from 12.4 to 1034 mg m-3. Levels were above the threshold limit of OSHA in 49 of \n\nthe 50 analysed samples. Acetaldehyde and acetone were below the limits in all samples. \n\nFormaldehyde was one of the most abundant pollutants measured indoors and outdoors of \n\nthree Turkish schools during spring, autumn and winter (Sofuoglu et al., 2011). \n\nFormaldehyde was either the highest concentration compound among those measured in \n\nthis study or was at comparable levels with toluene and benzene. The mean and median \n\nconcentrations were all close and ranged from 19 to 55 \u00b5g m-3. The most pronounced \n\ndifference among the three schools in formaldehyde concentrations were observed in fall \n\ncampaign (the difference between two of the schools was 36 \u00b5g m-3), while the gap was not \n\nas wide in winter (14 \u00b5g m-3) and spring (8 \u00b5g m-3). Health outcomes like lung \n\ninflammation, nasal, throat, eyes, skin irritations, SBS symptoms and cancer are related to \n\nformaldehyde exposure (Franklin et al., 2000; Norback et al., 2000; Pazdrak et al., 1993; \n\nSamet et al., 1988; Sundell et al., 1993; Wantke et al., 1996). \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nSeveral studies have reported that exposure to bioaerosol (diverse variety of agents \n\nfrom biological sources) in indoor environment is often associated with allergies, asthma, \n\nrhinitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and SBS symptoms (Beaumont, 1988; Dales et al., \n\n1991; Li and Hsu, 1997; Meyer et al., 2002; Norback et al., 2000; Roponen et al., 2002; \n\nSiersted and Gravensen, 1993; Sigsgaard et al., 2002). Reported microbiological \n\ncontaminants included allergens in deposited dust, fungi, and bacteria. Levels of specific \n\nallergens were sufficient to cause symptoms in allergic occupants (Norback et al., 2000; \n\nRoponen et al., 2002; Sigsgaard et al., 2002). There is evidence that low ventilation rates, \n\noccupant density, and high humidity level can lead to increased airborne microorganisms \n\nin classrooms (Brundage et al., 1998; Fisk et al., 2001; Smedje et al., 1996). Many studies \n\nreport airborne bacteria measurements ranging from 7 to 19500 CFU m-3 (Bates and \n\nMahaffy, 1996; Black and Worthan, 1995; Cousins and Collett, 1989; Gallup et al., 1993; \n\nMaroni et al., 1993; Meklin et al., 1996; Mouilleseaux et al., 1993; Thorne, 1993). \n\nThe studies investigating causal relationships between health symptoms and \n\nexposures to specific pollutants suggest that such symptoms in schools are related to bad \n\nventilation and exposures to allergens, VOCs, formaldehyde, moulds and microbial VOCs \n\n(Mi et al., 2006; Taskinen et al., 2002).  \n\nLittle is known about the characterisation of PM found inside the classrooms. The \n\nincreased PM concentrations in schools could be from the students\u2019 physical activity that \n\ncontributes to a constant process of resuspension of sedimented particles, from their owner \n\nclass activities, from skin desquamation or clothing, and from outdoor sources (Brunekreef \n\net al., 1997; Diapouli et al., 2008; Ekmekcioglu and Keskin, 2007; Fromme et al., 2007; \n\nJanssen et al., 2003; Lee and Chang; 2000; Peacock et al., 2003; P\u00e9nard-Morand et al., \n\n2005;. Richmon-Bryant et al., 2009; Van Roosbroeck et al., 2007). Brunekreef et al. (1997) \n\nstudied 13 schools located 35 \u2013 645 m from a motorway. The PM10 levels ranged from \n\n6.73 to 20.8 \u00b5g m-3 in schools farthest from the road, and from 9.20 to 32.8 \u00b5g m-3 in \n\nschools nearest from the road. Lee and Chang (2000) found PM10 concentrations above the \n\nacceptable maximum values stipulated by the local legislation at five schools in Hong \n\nKong. Branis et al. (2005) studied the effects of outdoor air and human activities in PM10, \n\nPM2.5 and PM1 concentrations in Prague schools. The results confirmed that human \n\nactivities are an important factor for high indoor particulate levels and that outdoor \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nconcentrations influence the indoor environment. Five elementary schools in Istanbul, \n\nTurkey, showed PM10 levels varying from 27.9 to 289 \u00b5g m\n-3 according to the traffic \n\nintensity (Ekmekcioglu and Keskin, 2007). In 64 schools in Munich, Fromme et al. (2007) \n\nobserved indoor PM concentrations lower in the summer and twice higher during the \n\nwinter. The high occupants\u2019 number associated with the small size of classrooms and poor \n\nventilation contributes to increased concentrations of PM in the winter. Seven primary \n\nschools in Athens, Greece, have been reported to present higher indoor PM10 (229 \u00b5g m\n-3) \n\nthan outdoor levels (166 \u00b5g m-3) (Diapouli et al., 2008). \n\nMej\u00eda et al. (2011) compiled information about data collection, analysis and health \n\neffects of air pollutants in school children. The compilation has demonstrated that indoor \n\nnormally exceed outdoor levels and that IAQ is affected by the penetration of outdoor \n\npollutants, wall absorption, emissions from furniture and other materials, level and length \n\nof occupancy, quality of ventilation, and resuspension by children movement around \n\nduring their school day. The study also points to the fact that there is strong evidence that \n\nlow socioeconomic level is highly correlated with the proximity of the school to pollution \n\nsources.  \n\nAn increase in the prevalence of asthma and rhinitis has been documented in the \n\nlast decades in Europe. For many reasons shown before, school population is a susceptible \n\ngroup, and there are evidences on the potential detrimental role to health of a variety of \n\nindoor pollutants that can be found in classroom environments. Recently, many European \n\nprojects have been carried out to characterise indoor and outdoor environments, possible \n\npollutant sources and relationships between pollutants and health in schools. \n\nVarious IAQ problems in schools from European countries, a lack of standardised \n\nmethodologies, and an absence of studies on consequences to health or on the effect of \n\ndifferent local policies regarding school buildings were reported by the European \n\nFederation of Allergy and Airways Diseases Patients Associations (EFA, 2002). \n\nSeveral common IAQ problems in schools were detected by a preliminary study \n\nconducted by the HESE (\u201cHealth Effects of Schools Environment\u201d) project, mainly \n\ninadequate ventilation (Ciarleglio et al., 2006a; Norback et al., 2006). This study also \n\nencountered a lack of preparation of educators and officials to deal with environmental \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nissues and health problems of more sensitive students, such as asthmatics and allergy-\n\nsuffers (Ciarleglio et al., 2006b).  \n\nIn 2008, the \u201cEuropean Indoor Air Monitoring and Exposure Assessment Project\u201d \n\n(AIRMEX) evaluated the exposure to indoor air chemicals and possible health risks, \n\nmainly the effect of VOCs (aromatics, carbonyls, and terpenoids) on human health. Many \n\nmeasuring campaigns were performed in public buildings (town halls, guild halls), schools \n\nand kindergartens in various cities from Southern and Central Europe. It was concluded \n\nthat personal exposure concentrations are higher than the indoor (generally twice times) or \n\noutdoor (significantly higher) concentrations (Geiss et al., 2011; Kotzias, 2005; Kotzias et \n\nal., 2009). In most cases, indoor pollutant concentrations were higher at homes than at \n\npublic buildings and school/kindergartens, probably because there are stronger indoor \n\nsources at dwellings (Geiss et al., 2011; Kotzias et al., 2009). From investigations using \n\nmicroarray-based gene expression profiling (toxicogenomics), it was concluded that \n\ntoluene, benzene and other single aromatic compounds in indoor air enhance non-\n\ncarcinogenic responses, such as inflammation (Kotzias et al., 2009). Key findings highlight \n\nthe need for further research to assess the burden of indoor air pollution at schools and \n\nkindergartens in Europe. \n\nThe \u201cSchool Environment and Respiratory Health of Children\u201d (SEARCH) \n\nconstituted a research project implemented within the international frameworks of the EU \n\nAction Plan on Environment and Health; and the World Health Organisation's Children\u2019s \n\nEnvironment and Health Action Plan for Europe. The first phase of the SEARCH project \n\n(2006\u20132009) led to the creation of a comprehensive environment and health database \n\nthrough assessments in selected European countries. Stakeholders and experts requested a \n\nfollow-up project to continue the valuable research activities. SEARCH II was developed \n\nin order to expand the monitoring of children\u2019s health and air quality. This follow-up \n\nproject included the design of environment and health capacity-building programmes for \n\nschool staff and training for local implementation strategies. Four new countries, Belarus, \n\nKazakhstan, Tajikistan and Ukraine, have joined the SEARCH I participants Albania, \n\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Hungary, Italy, Serbia and Slovakia. The project contributed to \n\nthe European legal and policy framework for sustainability in schools, since children\u2019s \n\nhealth and educational potential depend on the quality of the school environment. \n\n\n\n 21 \n\nClassrooms painted with water-resistant paints presented great levels of benzene, xylenes \n\nand ethylbenzene, and the occupants of these classrooms showed more prevalence of \n\nallergies. The presence of new furniture was related to high ethylbenzene and xylene \n\nconcentrations. Classrooms with carpets on the floor showed increased VOC and NO2 \n\nlevels, which were related to students woken by wheezing at night. Schools located near \n\nheavy traffic and/or industry areas had an adverse effect on children exposure. An elevated \n\nnumber of students in a classroom were associated with higher CO2 and PM10 levels. \n\nInsufficient ventilation during the class period was related to increased levels of CO2 and \n\nformaldehyde and a high number of chronic bronchitis and asthma cases (Csobod et al., \n\n2010). Recommendations were made for improving the school environment, buildings and \n\nenergy consumption based on an analysis of data from the 10 countries.  \n\nThe \u201cBinnenlucht in Basisscholen\u201d \u2013 BiBa project (Dutch acronym for indoor air in \n\nprimary schools) evaluated IAQ in classrooms of thirty Flemish primary schools. The \n\nassessment included classroom inspections, measurements of ventilation rates, relative \n\nhumidity, temperature, and medical tests for respiratory function in more than 1500 \n\nchildren, and measurement of exposure to chemical pollutants, such as PM2.5, PMx, \n\nbenzene, toluene, tetrachlorethene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, 1,2,4-triethylbenzene, total \n\nVOCs, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and total other aldehydes. A very high variability in \n\nconcentrations among classrooms was observed, BiBa concluded that concentrations of \n\nmany chemicals were much higher indoors than outdoors. Formaldehyde, benzene, total \n\nVOCs, CO2 and other parameters often exceeded the Flemish indoor environment \n\nguidelines (Stranger et al., 2010). \n\nThe project \u201cHealth Effects of Indoor Pollutants: Integrating Microbial, \n\nToxicological and Epidemiological Approaches\u201d (HITEA) has been studying the \n\nrelationship between the role of biological agents present in indoor air and long term \n\nrespiratory, inflammatory and allergic health impacts among children and adults. HITEA \n\nfocused on many indoor exposures and factors, like allergens, chemicals, cleaning agents, \n\ntraffic exhaust and poor ventilation, but the main objective focused on microbial exposures \n\ndue to dampness and moisture problems of buildings. Other important objective of this \n\nproject was to propose new approaches to characterise indoor biological exposures, by \n\nusing novel methods to measure airborne exposure and by characterising the house dust for \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nits in vitro toxicity, inflammatory properties and microbial toxin content. The HITEA has \n\nalready tested if exposure to endotoxin could be associated with increased respiratory \n\nsymptoms and injury in lung function in adults. Bakolis et al. (2012) found endotoxin \n\nlevels varying from 0.1 to 402.6 EU mg-1. However, there was no evidence of cause-effect \n\nof endotoxin exposure and lung function problems. \n\nThe \u201cLarge Analysis and Review of European housing and health Status\u201d (LARES) \n\nproject evaluated relationship between housing and health focusing indoor air pollution, \n\nthe effect of cold homes and dampness, noise effects, and domestic accidents. The LARES \n\nproject achieved a more comprehensive understanding of housing and health in the WHO \n\nEuropean region. The WHO/LARES concluded that the main features of housing \n\nimpacting health were often related to thermal comfort, indoor air quality (dampness, \n\nmoulds, indoor emissions, infestations, and others), noise, home safety, and social and \n\nphysical quality of the housing (WHO, 2007). This study corroborates the importance of \n\nstudying the indoor school environment since it is the second place where children spend \n\nmore time, after their homes. \n\nThe project \u201cSchools Indoor Pollution and Health: Observatory Network in \n\nEurope\u201d (SINPHONIE) is currently ongoing with a special focus on schools and childcare \n\ncentres. Thirty-eight environment and health institutions from 25 countries have been \n\ninvolved in SINPHONIE tasks. This study aims at capitalising on the existing knowledge \n\nand information and taking this opportunity to extend the spectrum of information \n\navailable covering the new and some assessing countries through a standardised procedure \n\nin order to be able to produce a set of policies, guidelines and good practices manual that \n\nassure the best indoor environment for children in schools within the European Union. In \n\nPortugal, six elementary schools and two kindergartens has been studied in Aveiro and \n\nOporto cities.  \n\nIn Portugal, the \u201cHealth and The Air We Breathe\u201d (SaudAR) studied the relation \n\nbetween outdoor and indoor air quality and human health in Viseu city. The study region \n\nwas characterised in terms of air quality, economical and social development and \n\npopulation health. Two different populations of children with wheezing symptoms were \n\ncompared, but no differences were found concerning the prevalence of wheezing \n\n(Neuparth et al., 2006). The SaudAR project pointed out that state of buildings and \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nventilation are one of the major problems in schools. In the frame of SaudAR study, \n\nValente (2010) evaluated IAQ at 4 schools in the city of Viseu, Portugal, during the \n\nsummer and winter of 2006 and 2007. The PM concentrations ranged according to the \n\nseason. Values were higher in summer. PM concentrations were higher indoors than \n\noutdoors. The low levels observed during weekends suggested that higher PM \n\nconcentration during week days are related to human activities. \n\nPortugal participated in the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in \n\nChildhood Program (ISAAC) in 1993. The ISAAC program was created in 1991 with the \n\naim to assess the prevalence and progression of asthma and allergic diseases, using a \n\nstandardised written questionnaire, translated and adapted to several languages, including \n\nPortuguese (Asher et al., 1995). The survey questionnaire was distributed to students \n\nbetween 13 and 14 years old in five geographic areas (Lisbon, Oporto, Coimbra, Funchal \n\nand Portim\u00e3o). In Lisbon, Funchal and Portim\u00e3o, 6 and 7 years old children were also \n\nquestioned (Pinto et al., 2006; Trindade, 1999). This study pointed to significant regional \n\ndifferences in terms of prevalence of respiratory symptoms, recommending further studies \n\nto define evolutionary trends and identify risk factors. Khan et al. (2007) applied an \n\nadapted version of the ISAAC questionnaire to 995 children in 2006. This survey study \n\nwas compared with the results, interpretations and correlations obtained in the ISAAC \n\n2002 programme, which questioned 2484 children from 6 to 7 years of age from the basic \n\nschools of Lisbon, fromNovember 2002 till March 2003. It was observed a decrease for \n\nwheeze and rhinitis and an increase for asthma between the ISAAC studies in 2002 and \n\n2006.  \n\nFraga et al. (2008) evaluated the association between the IAQ in Oporto schools \n\nand the prevalence of allergic and respiratory symptoms in adolescents. High CO2 \n\nconcentrations were associated with greater respiratory symptoms. Madureira et al. (2009) \n\ncharacterised the IAQ in Oporto schools to evaluate cases of health symptoms reported by \n\nteachers and to study the impact of pollutants on the prevalence of these symptoms. CO2 \n\nconcentrations exceeded the reference values and the increasing of PM concentrations was \n\nassociated with the use of chalk.  \n\nAs far as it is known, an extended characterisation of the IAQ in elementary \n\nschools in Lisbon and Aveiro has not been performed before. Besides contributing to \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nunderstand regional differences, the evaluation of IAQ in Portuguese institutions is a \n\ncritically important aspect of creating and maintaining school facilities, helping to resolve \n\nor alleviate problems of contaminated air if they do arise, seeking to eliminate potential \n\nsources of contamination that originate from outdoors as well as indoors, and taking steps \n\nto ensure a safe and healthy working environment for staff and students. It also constitutes \n\nan opportunity to develop and apply routine methodologies of evaluating IAQ and making \n\na reflection on the necessity of updating or reviewing the applicable legislation. \n\n \n\n1.4 Objectives  \n\n \n\nThe urban inhabitants spend about 90% of their days in indoor environments, such \n\nas homes, workplaces, schools, universities, shopping centres and vehicles. \n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that a poor IAQ is associated with adverse health \n\neffects, including higher rates of chronic disease and mortality due to cardiovascular and \n\nrespiratory diseases. Studies on IAQ in schools found in scientific literature have \n\ndemonstrated that school environment usually presents higher levels of pollutants than \n\noutdoor environments. It is observed that the health problems caused by indoor \n\nenvironments with low ventilation and high levels of pollutants may reduce the \n\nperformance of the occupants. However, little is known about the specific composition and \n\ncharacterisation of indoor air in schools. \n\nThe main purpose of this study is to evaluate the IAQ in elementary schools of \n\nLisbon and Aveiro. Specific goals were: \n\n- to measure the physical parameters and chemical and biological pollutants of \n\nindoor (and related outdoor) air in schools; \n\n- screening of conditions that could be the cause for poor IAQ in schools, \n\nidentifying potential outdoor/indoor pollutant sources and evaluating the influence of \n\ndifferent classroom/building materials and school habits on the air quality indoors; \n\n- to get the actual state for asthma/rhinitis in primary school population in Lisbon; \n\n- to propose possible mitigation measures; \n\n\n\n 25 \n\n- to test the use of houseplants as a mitigation measure in a school indoor \n\nenvironment. \n\n \n\n1.5 Description of locations covered in the study \n\n \n\n Lisbon is located at the mouth of the Tagus river (38\u00ba42\u201949.75\u201dN, 9\u00ba8\u201921.79\u201dW) \n\nand is the westernmost capital of Europe. It is the largest city of Portugal with a population \n\nof 547,631 within its administrative limits on a land area of 84.8 km2. However, the Lisbon \n\nmetropolitan area extends on an area of 958 km2 with about 3 million people. The climate \n\nis characterised by mild winters and warm to hot summers. The average annual \n\ntemperature is 21\u00baC during the day and 13\u00baC at night. In January, the coldest month, the \n\nmaximum temperature typically ranges from 10 to 18\u00baC during the day, while the \n\nminimum values range from 4 to 12\u00baC at night. In August, the warmest month, the \n\nmaximum temperature ranges from 27 to 33\u00baC during the day, while the minimum \n\ntemperature ranges from 18 to 22\u00baC at night. \n\n The elementary schools involved in this study are located at different civil parishes: \n\nSanta Maria de Bel\u00e9m (I), Ajuda (J), Alc\u00e2ntara (H), Santo Condest\u00e1vel (M), S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 (C), \n\nBenfica (G), Campolide (L), S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Brito (B), Alvalade (N), Marvila (F) e Santa \n\nMaria dos Olivais (A, D and E) (Figure 1.2). \n\n \n\n\n\n 26 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.2. Location of schools involved in the study in the city of Lisbon. \n\n \n\n Aveiro is located at 40\u00ba43\u201923\u201dN, 8\u00ba31\u201944\u201dW, in the central coastal region of \n\nPortugal. The city extends on an area of 199.9 km2 with a population of 78,450. The \n\naverage annual temperature is about 18\u00baC during the day and 11\u00baC at night. In January, the \n\ncoldest month, the mean maximum temperature is 13.4\u00baC during the day, and the mean \n\nminimum temperature is 6.4\u00baC at night. In August, the warmest month, the mean \n\nmaximum temperature is 21.9\u00baC during the day, whereas the mean minimum temperature \n\nis 15\u00baC at night. \n\n The two elementary schools of this study are located at different civil parishes: \n\nGl\u00f3ria (A) and Vera Cruz (B) (Figure 1.3). \n\n \n\n\n\n 27 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.3. Location of the two involved in the study in the city of Aveiro.  \n\n \n\n1.6 General overview of the work performed \n\n \n\nParents of the students from the Lisbon schools were invited to answer a \n\nquestionnaire similar to that of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in \n\nChildhood Program (ISAAC) between October and December 2008 (Chapter 2). The \n\nsurvey aimed at identifying children with respiratory problems (wheezing, asthma and \n\nrhinitis), and assessing the nutrition habits, environmental aspects and housing conditions. \n\n Indoor and outdoor air samples were collected at three schools in Lisbon in \n\nDecember 2008. These schools were located in the city centre and were previously \n\nconsidered representative of all the elementary-level educational institutions for the \n\npreliminary study (Chapter 3). VOCs, formaldehyde and NO2 were passively monitored \n\nover a two-week period. Bacterial and fungal colony-forming units and comfort parameters \n\nwere also monitored at classrooms and playgrounds. This campaign was important to \n\ndefine methodologies that were subsequently used at all 14 schools in Lisbon. \n\n\n\n 28 \n\n Chapters 4 and 5 evaluated the indoor and outdoor levels of NO2, speciated VOCs \n\nand carbonyls at fourteen primary schools in Lisbon during spring, autumn and winter. \n\nThree of these schools were also selected to be monitored for comfort parameters, such as \n\ntemperature and relative humidity, CO2, CO, total VOCs, and both bacterial and fungal \n\ncolony-forming units per cubic metre. The three monitoring campaigns enabled carrying \n\nout a seasonal evaluation of outdoor and indoor air quality at Lisbon schools. \n\n Chapter 6 investigated pollutant concentrations inside and outside school buildings \n\nat different locations (city centre and suburban) in Aveiro, between April and June 2010. \n\nThe aim was to evaluate simultaneously comfort parameters (temperature, CO2 and CO) \n\nand indoor and outdoor concentrations of VOCs, NO2, PM10 and bioaerosol. PM10 samples \n\nwere analysed and characterised, for the first time, for the water soluble inorganic ions \n\n(WSII), organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), carbonates, and detailed organic \n\nspeciation. \n\n To evaluate the efficacy of a possible mitigation measure, Chapter 7 presents the \n\neffect of using common houseplants on the indoor air quality in a classroom of a school in \n\nAveiro. Based on previous test-chamber studies carried out in the USA, the three species \n\nchosen were Dracaena deremensis \u201cJanet Craig\u201d (Janet Craig), Dracaena marginata \n\n(Marginata) and Spathiphyllum \u201cMauna Loa\u201d (Peace lily). Indoor and outdoor \n\nconcentrations of VOCs, carbonyls, and PM10 (inorganic ions, OC and EC) were measured \n\nin the absence and presence of plants and the IAQ between both periods was compared. \n\n \n\n1.7 Details of experimental work carried out \n\n \n\n1.7.1 Comfort parameters \n \n\n Continuous measurements of temperature, relative humidity (RH), CO2 and total \n\nVOCs were performed with an automatic portable Indoor Air IQ-610 Quality Probe \n\n(GrayWolf\u00ae monitor) at schools (Figure 1.4). \n\n \n\n\n\n 29 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.4. Indoor air quality monitor IQ-610 - GrayWolf\u00ae. \n\n \n\nThis IAQ monitor includes a Pt100 probe for measuring temperature in a range \n\nfrom 5\u00ba to 160\u00baF (-15\u00baC to +70\u00baC) with accuracy of \u00b1 0.3\u00baC; and a capacitance probe to \n\nsense RH in a range from 0 to 100% with accuracy of \u00b1 2% RH for values under 80% (\u00b1 \n\n3% RH for values above 80% RH). The monitor also includes a CO2 non-dispersive \n\ninfrared sensor (NDIR) in a range from 0 to 10,000 ppm with accuracy of \u00b1 3% rdg \u00b1 50 \n\nppm, and an electrochemical sensor to measure CO in a range from 0 to 500 ppm with \n\naccuracy of \u00b1 2 ppm under 50 ppm, and \u00b1 3% rdg above 50 ppm. To track total VOCs over \n\ntime, the monitor encompasses a photo-ionisation detector (PID) operating in the 5-20,000 \n\nppb range with resolution of 1 ppb and a limit of detection under 5 ppb. It is possible to \n\nselect TVOCs units among ppb, ppm, \u00b5g m-3 and mg m-3. The PID sensor does not respond \n\nto VOCs with ionisation potentials above 10.6, such as ethane, methane or formaldehyde. \n\nHowever, it responds to the vast majority of VOCs. All sensors exhibit an extremely fast \n\nresponse; most reading are registered in less than 1 minute. It displays measurements in \n\nreal time allowing logged data to be downloaded to the WolfSense\u00ae PC software for \n\nanalysis. The operating range is 0 to 90% RH at -15 to 60\u00baC for VOCs, and 0 to 98% RH at \n\n-15 to 70\u00baC for other sensors. The equipment was supplied with a factory calibration \n\ncertificate, but it is checked prior to next use with appropriate calibration kits (Figure 1.5). \n\nFor the calibration of VOCs, it is recommended to use isobutylene in a known \n\nconcentration. To make the zero point for VOCs, CO2 and CO, it is recommended to use \n\nnitrogen gas. For correction of the CO calibration straight line, a certified cylinder \n\ncontaining this gas at a concentration of 330 ppm was used. For the correction of the CO2 \n\n\n\n 30 \n\ncalibration, CO2 gas at 350 ppm for the lower point and 1,000 ppm for the higher point was \n\nemployed. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.5. Gas calibration hood and certified cylinders used with the air quality monitor. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.7.2 Microorganisms \n \n\nTaking into account that the National System for Energy and Indoor Air Quality \n\nCertification of Buildings (DL 79/2006, RSECE) restricts the bioaerosol measurements to \n\nbacterial and fungal colony-forming units per cubic metre of air (CFU m-3), only viable \n\nand culturable fungi and bacteria were quantified. Viable microorganism levels were \n\nmonitored by liquid impinger sampling (May and Harper, 1957) in the classrooms and \n\nplaygrounds. The liquid impinger was first described by Greenburg and Smith (1922) as a \n\ndust cloud sampler. More recently, the device has come into wide use for bioaerosol \n\nsampling, as it is often very convenient for this purpose both in laboratory and in the field. \n\nThe positive aspects that were decisive in choosing the method were: it is compact and \n\ninexpensive; the sample fluid can be plated out simultaneously on different culture \n\nmedium, thus ensuring optimum growth conditions for organisms of interest; an extreme \n\nrange of airborne concentrations can be accommodated by the serial dilution technique; the \n\nparticle retention efficiency is very high (all particles down to about 0.5 \u00b5 m are effectively \n\ntrapped in the impinger fluid); it gives a measure of the number of individual viable \n\n\n\n 31 \n\norganisms (colony-forming units), it acts as its own constant flow metering device; and, it \n\nis unaffected by the repeated autoclaving of the material.  \n\nThe apparatus used for the liquid impinger sampling is shown in Figure 1.6. The \n\nsampling train was composed of an impinger flask, a vacuum pump, a calibrated flow \n\nmeter and a flow control valve. May and Harper (1957) concluded that sonic velocity \n\nimpingement has a lethal effect on the more sensitive types of bacterial cells. The \n\nrecommended optimum impingement velocity is of roughly 3.0 - 2.5 l min-1. Sampling \n\ntook one hour at each sampling place, totalising samples of 180 l and 150 l of air. \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n\nFigure 1.6. Liquid impinger sampling in classroom and at playground. \n\n \n\nTo capture bioaerosols, 0.1% peptone water was used. This solution is used for the \n\ncapture and/or the cultivation of microorganisms. It is a minimal growth medium, \n\ncontaining peptone as a source of carbon, nitrogen, vitamins and minerals. Sodium \n\nchloride maintains the osmotic balance. The peptone water solid formula was dissolved in \n\nthe needed amount of purified water, mixed thoroughly, separated at doses of 60 ml for \n\neach sample in Schott bottles, and autoclaved at 121\u00baC for 15 minutes.  \n\nA non-selective and a selective culture media were used for microorganisms\u2019 \n\ngrowth. Tryptic soy agar (TSA) is a general purpose culture medium for cultivation and \n\nisolation of microorganisms or for maintenance of stock culture. The TSA composition is \n\ncasein peptone (pancreatic), soya peptone (papainic), sodium chloride and agar. To prepare \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nthis medium, 40 g of dehydrated media were suspended in 1 l of purified water. The \n\nmedium was sterilised at 121\u00baC for 15 minutes, cooled to 45-50\u00baC, mixed gently and \n\ndispensed into sterile Petri dishes. Chloramphenicol rose bengal agar (CRBA) is used for \n\nthe selective isolation and enumeration of yeasts and moulds. CRBA is composed of \n\nmycological peptone, dextrose, monopotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, rose \n\nbengal, chloramphenicol, and agar. To prepare this medium, 32.15 g were suspended in 1 l \n\nof purified water, boiled to dissolve the medium completely, and sterilised by autoclaving \n\nat 121\u00b0C for 15 minutes. It was mixed thoroughly and dispensed into sterile Petri plates. \n\nThe peptone water bottles and the TSA and CRBA Petri dishes were storage at 4-8\u00baC after \n\nthe preparation.  \n\nAfter sampling, over a flame to avoid contamination, the amount of 60 ml of \n\npeptone water was immediately filtered (Figure 1.6) or storage under refrigeration. The \n\namount of 60 ml was used to have enough sampled solution for all the replicates and \n\npipette washing. Five replicates of 10 ml of solution were filtered under vacuum through a \n\nmembrane filter with porosity of 0.45 \u00b5m (Millipore), which retained bacteria cells and \n\nfungal spores. The membrane was placed on a selective culture medium (TSA for bacterial \n\nand CRBA for fungal) contained in a Petri dish (Figure 1.6). Before each filtration, the \n\nsolution was agitated for homogenisation of peptone water with microorganisms. After \n\nfiltration, the Petri dishes were incubated for 5 and 7 days for bacterial and fungal, \n\nrespectively, in dark boxes with constant ambient temperature (25oC) (Figure 1.7). The \n\nPetri dishes were observed and the colonies formed on the membrane were counted every \n\nday. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nFigure 1.7. Filtration of peptone water through a Millipore membrane and \n\nmicroorganism\u2019s growth in Petri dishes during the incubation period. \n\n \n\n1.7.3 NO2 \n \n\n For sampling and quantification of NO2, passive samplers based on absorption of \n\nion nitrite by triethanolamine (TEA) were used. These devices are small, lightweight, \n\nreusable, relatively cheap and efficient since they are not noisy and do not need a power \n\nsource. Their operation is based on the principle of molecular diffusion. The pollutant is \n\ndiffused from the zone with higher concentration (open end) to the absorbent that is placed \n\nat the opposite side of the tube. The samplers were exposed in the classroom and at \n\nplaygrounds during an extended period (2 weeks) to provide the average concentration of \n\nthe pollutant. A drawback of passive samplers is the impossibility of providing information \n\non maximum levels. So passive sampling is less suitable for compliance checking.  \n\n The NO2 passive samplers consist of a cylindrical acrylic tube of 7.1 cm in length \n\nand 1.1 cm internal diameter, with two polyethylene lids that fit perfectly in each end. Two \n\nwire meshes are placed in one lid to hold up the absorption solution (TEA). The tubes are \n\nplaced on polyvinyl chloride (PVC) supports in vertical position to avoid ingress of rain, \n\nwith the impregnated cap at the top and without cap at the opposite end. Together with 3 \n\nreplicate tubes, a blank (double side capped) was collected at each sampling point. The \n\nconcentration of NO2 was calculated based on the average value of the three tubes \n\nexposed, subtracting the blank value (Bhugwant and Hoareau, 2003).  \n\n The preparation of the tubes involved the placement of two stainless steel mesh \n\njuxtaposed in one of the lids of each tube to which 30 \u00b5 l of triethanolamine in acetone \n\n\n\n 34 \n\n(1:1) solution were directly added (Gair et al., 1991; Heal et al., 1999). For the \n\nidentification, the lid with impregnated mesh was marked abroad. \n\n The analytical procedure followed that described in Methods for the Determination \n\nof Indoor Pollutants (Winberry et al., 1993) with some modifications adopted in most \n\nBritish laboratories (Atkins and Lee, 1995). For calibration, a set of seven standard \n\nsolutions were prepared with different concentrations (0 to 0.00035 mg ml-1) from a \n\nsodium nitrite stock solution (1,725 g l-1).  \n\nAfter the exposure, the samples were stored in a refrigerator and analysed within 24 \n\nto 48 hours. For each sample, the lid without mesh was removed and 5 ml of a combined \n\nreagent were added into the tube. This reagent is composed of 20 parts of 1% \n\nsulphanilamide solution in 2.5% phosphoric acid and one part of 0.14% N-1-naphtilene \n\ndiamine (NEDA) solution. The tube was closed and agitated. After 20-30 minutes, the \n\nabsorbance of the solutions was read in a spectrophotometer at 540 nm in a 1 cm cell.  \n\nFigure 1.8 depicts at a glance the steps from sampling to analysis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 35 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.8. PVC holders, NO2 diffusive tubes, spectrophotometer, and an example of \n\ncalibration line to calculate the concentrations in each sample.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1.7.4 VOCs \n \n\n Passive samplers for VOCs from Radiello\u00ae were used to obtain a screening of \n\nheavy and light molecular weight compounds. Indoor passive samples were collected at a \n\nheight of about 1.5 m above the floor. They were positioned at a distance that should \n\nexceed 1 m from a window or a door. Outdoor passive samples were collected at heights of \n\nabout 2 m above the ground.  \n\nOne of the techniques recommended for analysis of these VOCs samples is gas \n\nchromatography coupled to flame ionisation detector (GC-FID). The GC is an instrument \n\nable to separate chemicals compounds in a complex mixture sample. It uses a capillary \n\ncolumn through which different chemical constituents of a sample pass in a gas stream, \n\n\n\n 36 \n\ncalled carrier gas (mobile phase) at different velocities depending on their chemical and \n\nphysical properties and their interaction with the column coating (stationary phase). The \n\nstationary phase separates the components, causing each one a different retention time. \n\nBeyond the stationary phase, other components are determinant in the retention time, such \n\nas the carrier gas flow rate, type of carrier gas, column length, diameter and coating \n\nmaterial, and temperature ramp in the oven. When the chemical compounds exit at the end \n\nof the column, they are detected by FID (Branco, 2005). A schematic representation of a \n\nGC-FID is shown in the Figure 1.9. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.9. Schematic representation of a GC-FID.  \n\n \n\n \n\n FID is a non-selective detector used in conjunction with a GC. It works by directing \n\nthe gas phase output from the column into the hydrogen flame. The high temperature is \n\nneeded to make sure that as soon as the carrier gas (eluent) exits the column, it does not \n\ncome out of the gaseous phase and deposit on the interface between the column and the \n\nFID. This deposition would result in loss of eluent and errors in detection. As the eluent \n\ntravels up the FID, it is mixed with the hydrogen fuel and then with the oxidant. The \n\n\n\n 37 \n\neluent, fuel and oxidant mixture continues to travel up to the nozzle head where a positive \n\nbias voltage exists. A voltage is applied between the flame and an electrode located away \n\nfrom the flame. This positive bias helps to repel the reduced carbon ions created by the \n\nflame pyrolysing the eluent. The ions are repelled up toward the collector plates that are \n\nconnected to a very sensitive ammeter, which detects the ions hitting the plates, then feeds \n\nthat signal to an amplifier, integrator and display system. Although the signal current is \n\nvery small, the noise level is also very small. Except for a very few organic compounds \n\n(e.g. carbon monoxide) the FID detects all carbon containing compounds (Scott, 2003). A \n\nschematic representation of a FID is depicted in Figure 1.10. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.10. Schematic representation of a FID.  \n\n \n\n \n\nVOCs adsorved in activated charcoal Radiello\u00ae cartridges (RAD 130, Sigma-\n\nAldrich) were recovered by 2 ml of carbon disulfide (CS2 from Aldrich) with the internal \n\nstandard 2-fluorotoluene with 7.2 ng \u00b5 l-1 (Sigma-Aldrich), during 30 min. Depending on \n\nthe sampling campaign, analyses were performed by gas chromatography in a Chrompack \n\nCP 9001 or a Thermo Scientific Trace GC Ultra, coupled to flame ionisation detectors \n\n(GC-FID), using nitrogen or helium as carrier gas at constant pressure of 20 psi. Injections \n\nFlame Ionisation Detector \n\n+300V \nPolarising voltage \n\n\n\n 38 \n\nof 4 \u00b5 l of each standard solution or sample were made, with a split ratio of 25:1. A 100% \n\ndimethylpolysiloxane column (0.2 mm, 50 m, film thickness 0.5 \u00b5m) was used under the \n\nfollowing temperature programme: 50oC for 5 min, 5oC min-1 up to 80oC, 15oC min-1 up to \n\n135oC, 20oC min-1 up to 220oC, final isotherm for 20 min. The injector and detector \n\ntemperatures were 240 and 300oC, respectively. The equipments were calibrated before \n\nand during the analyses of samples by injecting standard solutions of all compounds \n\nidentified in CS2, specifically: butanol, ethanol, acetone, pentane, n-hexane, cyclohexane, \n\nn-heptane, n-butyl acetate, styrene, eucalyptol, nonane, ?-pinene, sabinene, ?-pinene, n-\n\ndecane, (+)-3-carene, limonene (all from Fluka), methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isooctane, \n\nm,p-xylene, o-xylene (all from Merck), benzene (AnalytiCals), toluene (Lab-Scan), \n\nethylbenzene, methyl cyclohexane, n-undecane, naphthalene, tridecane, 4-metil-2-\n\npentanone, 2-etoxietanol, n-heptane, propyl acetate, isopropanol, ?-terpinene (all from \n\nAldrich), and dichloromethane (Fischer Scientific). Standard solutions containing these \n\ncompounds in CS2 and internal standard have been prepared. The analytes in these \n\nstandard solutions were present in concentrations of 40, 20, 10 and 5 ng \u00b5l-1. From the \n\ncalibration, it was possible to obtain the relative response factor (RRF) for each compound \n\nor chemical group. The RRF is calculated through the following equation: \n\n \n\nISc\n\ncIS\n\nAm\n\nAm\nRRF\n\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\n=                                                                                                           (1.1) \n\nwhere mIS is the injected mass of internal standard (ng), Ac is the area in the chromatogram \n\nof the compound injected, mc is the injected mass of the compound, and AIS is the area of \n\ninternal standard. After calculation of RRF values, by inverting equation (1.1), it is \n\npossible to determine the amounts of analytes in the samples (m\nC\n). \n\n All the chromatograms were analysed and integrated by Xcalibur Software for \n\nThermo Scientific. \n\nAverage concentration (in \u00b5 g m-3) over the whole exposure time is calculated \n\naccording to the following expression: \n\n\n\n 39 \n\n1000000\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\n=\ntQ\n\nm\nC                                                                                                     (1.2) \n\nwhere C is the concentration of a specific VOC in the air (\u00b5g m-3), m is the mass of analyte \n\nin \u00b5g, Q is the sampling rate at the temperature K, and t is the exposure time in minutes. \n\nSampling rates were calculated as follows: \n\n5.1\n\n298\n298\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?=\nK\n\nQQK                                                                                                      (1.3) \n\nwhere QK is the sampling rate at the temperature K and Q298 is the reference value at 298 \n\nK. This produces a variation of \u00b15% for 10 \u00b0C variation (upwards or downwards) from 25 \n\n\u00b0C. The sampling rate is invariant with humidity in the range 15-90% and with wind speed \n\nbetween 0.1 and 10 m s-1. The average concentration over the exposure time interval is \n\ntherefore calculated from the mass of analyte found onto the cartridge and exposure time \n\nwithout introducing any corrective factor, apart from corrections due to average \n\ntemperatures different from 25 \u00b0C. \n\nFigure 1.11 illustrates the procedure, from sampling to analysis, for the \n\ndetermination of VOCs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nFigure 1.11.

These were extracted with 2 ml of acetonitrile (from Fisher \n\nScientific). The glass vials were shaken for approximately 30 minutes and the extract \n\nfiltered through 0.45 \u00b5m disc membrane filters (filtration kit RAD 174) and injected into \n\nthe high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The analytical system \n\nconsisted of a Jasco PU- 980 pump, a Rheodyne manual injection valve (sample loop of 20 \n\n\u00b5l), a Supelcosil LC-18 column (250\u00d74.6 mm; 5 \u00b5m; Supelco) and a Jasco MD-1510 diode \n\narray detector, all connected in series. Isocratic elution at room temperature was performed \n\nusing an acetonitrile/ultrapure water solution (60/40, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate \n\n\n\n 41 \n\nof 1.5 ml min-1. Ultrapure water (Milli-Q system, Millipore) was used for the preparation \n\nof eluent for HPLC. The carbonyl concentrations were quantified with external calibrations \n\ncurves. A standard solution containing 15 DNPH derivatives (TO11/IP6A carbonyl \u2013 \n\nDNPH Mix from Supelco) was used for the identification and quantification of the \n\ncarbonyl compounds in the samples. The compounds present in the original calibration  \n\nmix were: formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, acrolein, propionaldehyde, \n\ncrotonaldehyde, butiraldehyde, benzaldehyde, isovaleraldehyde, valeraldehyde, o-\n\ntolualdehyde, m-tolualdehyde, p-tolualdehyde, hexaldehyde, and 2,5-\n\ndimethylbenzaldehyde, all of them in a concentration of 15 \u00b5 g ml-1. The original standard \n\nwas diluted in acetonitrile to obtain solutions with 3.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.0 \u00b5g ml-1. The \n\ncalibration line constructed from the standard solutions was confirmed every day before \n\nthe analysis (U.S. EPA, 1999). The limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 1.29 to 2.09 \u00b5g \n\nml-1. \n\nThe average concentration of carbonyls in passive samples over the whole \n\nsampling period is derived from the following equation: \n\n1000000\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\n=\ntQ\n\nm\nC                                                                                                    (1.4) \n\nwhere C is the concentration of carbonyl compound in the air (\u00b5g m-3), m is the mass of \n\naldehydes or ketones (\u00b5g), Q is the sampling rate at the temperature K, and t is the \n\nexposure time in minutes. The sampling rate varies with the effect of the temperature and \n\ncan be calculated by the following equation: \n\n35.0\n\n298\n298\n\n?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n?=\nK\n\nQQK                                                                                                     (1.5) \n\nwhere QK is the sampling rate at the temperature K and Q298 is the reference value at 298 \n\nK. As mentioned for VOCs, there is not variation in the sampling rate with humidity in the \n\nrange 15-90% and with wind speed between 0.1 and 10 m s-1. \n\nFigure 1.12 illustrates the steps for the determination of carbonyl compounds. \n\n\n\n 42 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.12. Cartridge RAD165 with the blue diffusive tube and triangular support for \n\nsampling, cartridge after sampling in the glass tube for extraction, filtration kit RAD174 to \n\nfilter the extracts, HPLC, and example of chromatogram.  \n\n \n\nActive sampling of carbonyls was carried out by pulling air through Sep-Pak\u00ae \n\nDNPH-silica cartridges. The sampling train consisted of a Thomas pump to draw in air at a \n\nflow rate of 2 l min-1 for a sampling time of one or two hours in agreement with the \n\nclassroom cycles, through the silica gel cartridges impregnated with 2,4-\n\ndinitrophenylhydrazine reagent, a dry gas meter to register the volume of air and ozone \n\nscrubbers to minimise ozone interferences. The analytes were extracted with 5 ml of \n\nacetonitrile using sonication extraction. The extracts were filtrated through gravity feed \n\nelution with the filtration kit RAD174, collected in 3 ml vials, and afterwards analysed in \n\nthe same HPLC system as passive samples (ASTM, 1997). The calibration was made with \n\nthe same standard solutions as previously described.

All filters used in this work were wrapped in aluminium foil and pre-baked at \n\n550\u00baC for 6 hours to eliminate organic contaminants. The filters were placed in a \n\ndesiccator overnight. Before and after sampling the gravimetric determination was \n\nperformed with a microbalance Mettler Toledo AG245 (readability- 0.1 mg/0.01 mg) \n\n(Figure. 1.14). The filter weights were obtained from the average of about 5-6 weights \n\nwith similar values. Typically it was necessary to weigh each filter approximately 10 times \n\nto have 5-6 equal measures. The gravimetric determinations were done at 45-50% relative \n\nhumidity.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 44 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.14. Filter loaded with PM10 being weighted in the microbalance. \n\n \n\n \n\n To carry out the PM10 collection two pairs of samplers were simultaneously used \n\none in the classroom and other at the playground (Figures 1.15 and 1.16). One of the \n\nsampling systems was a Tecora with PM10 European inlet. The flow was controlled \n\nautomatically and set at 38 l min-1, in accordance with the EN 12341 standard. The other \n\nsampling systems were composed of Gent heads with 10 \u00b5m cut-off containing a filter \n\nholder, a dry gas meter, and a vacuum pump. These assemblies were operated at a flow \n\nrate of about 12 l min-1.  \n\n Outdoors, sampling was performed at a height of about 3 m. The Gent inlet was \n\nprotected against bad weather conditions by covering with an inverted bucket. \n\n \n\n\n\n 45 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.15. Indoor PM10 sampling.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.16. Outdoor PM10 sampling.  \n\n \n\n \n\n To perform the calibration of the PM10 Gent samplers, the sampling pump, the dry \n\ngas meter and a calibrated mass flow meter were connected in series. The volume \n\nregistered over a period of time by the dry gas meter was compared with the value obtained \n\nby the mass flow meter, and a conversion factor was calculated.  \n\n Since two different sampling systems (Gent and Tecora) have been used, it was \n\nnecessary to determine if the samplers led to comparable concentrations of PM10. From \n\nparallel samplings, it was concluded that measurements by both systems correlate well \n\n(Figure. 1.17). \n\n\n\n 46 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.17. Relationship between PM10 concentrations determined by Gent and Tecora \n\nsamplers. \n\n \n\n \n\n1.7.7 Carbonaceous content of PM10 \n \n\nThe carbonaceous material (organic carbon, elemental carbon and carbonate) of \n\nPM10 was analysed by a home-made thermal-optical transmission system. The principle of \n\noperation is related to the volatilisation and oxidation of all the carbonaceous material to \n\nCO2 (Pio et al., 1994). The temperature programme allows the separation of two different \n\norganic carbon fractions.  \n\nThe samples were previously acidified to minimise interference of carbonates in the \n\nquantification of EC and OC. Punches of the filters were exposed to vapours of \n\nhydrochloric acid (HCl \u2013 6 M) for approximately 4 hours. After this period, the samples \n\nwere transferred to a desiccator containing hydroxide sodium (NaOH), where they were \n\nkept overnight. The purpose of this process is to neutralise any excess of acid in the sample \n\nto protect de CO2 analyser from corrosive HCl fumes. \n\n\n\n 47 \n\nThe thermo-optical system comprises a quartz oven with two distinct heating zones \n\nwith a thermocouple each one to monitor the evolution of the temperature. It also contains \n\na helium-neon laser (632.8 nm) and a detector connected to a transducer. Associated with \n\nthe laser, there is a chopper whose function is to eliminate interferences that may occur due \n\nto the existence of other light sources. To detect the amount of carbon in various stages of \n\nheating, the system has a calibrated infrared non-dispersive CO2 analyser. The temperature \n\nprogramme is imposed by a controller. To control the flow of gases (N2 and O2) passing \n\nthrough the analysis system, a mass flow meter is used. A computer terminal makes the \n\ndata acquisition every second, recording various parameters, such as temperature, flow \n\nrate, and CO2 concentrations. Figure 1.18 depicts a schematic representation of the \n\nthermo-optical system. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 48 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.18. Scheme of the thermo-optical analyser to determine OC, EC and carbonate \n\n(Cerqueira et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nFor each filter, two 9 mm diameter punches were used in each analytical run. To \n\nstart the analysis, a purge to remove all traces of CO2 is carried out until zero is read by the \n\nanalyser. The data acquisition can be started as soon as the purge is completed. Due to the \n\nexistence of two distinct zones of heating, the analysis is done in two stages. In the first \n\nphase, the sample is subjected to an anoxic environment where there is only nitrogen. \n\nControlled heating in anoxic conditions is performed to separate OC into two fractions of \n\nincreasing volatility. The first fraction corresponds to the volatilisation at T<200\u00b0C of \n\nlower molecular weight organics (OC1). The second fraction is related to the \n\ndecomposition and oxidation of higher molecular weight species at temperatures ranging \n\nfrom 150 to 600\u00b0C (OC2). The last fraction of OC is identified by transmittance and \n\ncorresponds to pyrolysed organic carbon (PC) produced in the previous heating steps \n\n(Alves et al., 2011).  \n\nThe second stage starts by opening a valve that introduces air into the oven. \n\nOxygen will join the existing stream of nitrogen and will transform the atmosphere of the \n\n\n\n 49 \n\nfirst heating zone in a oxidising atmosphere. This factor, coupled with a further increase in \n\ntemperature, promotes oxidation and volatilisation of EC. The remaining fraction is \n\nsequentially evaporated/burnt under a gas flow containing O2. This last carbon fraction \n\ncontains initial EC plus OC that has pyrolysed during heating under an inert atmosphere. \n\nThe interference between PC and EC can be controlled by continuous evaluation of the \n\nblackening of the filter using a laser beam and a photodetector measuring the filter light \n\ntransmittance. At the point where the laser reaches the value of signal value is equal to the \n\ninitial point of separation of EC and pyrolitic carbon (Castro, 1997). It is considered that \n\nwhole pyrolitic carbon is the carbon mass recorded since it introduces oxygen into the \n\nsystem until the value of the transmittance of the laser to reach its initial value. From this \n\npoint, it is considered the carbonaceous mass being present as EC. The second heating \n\nzone has a constant temperature of 650\u00baC and the atmosphere inside comprises air and \n\nnitrogen. The walls of this area are coated with a catalyst (CuO), which certifies the \n\nconversion of any carbonaceous material to CO2 and can thus be ensured that there was \n\ncomplete oxidation of carbon volatilised in the previous zone. This procedure was \n\noriginally developed by Pio et al. (1994) and Carvalho et al. (2006) and was adapted by \n\nAlves et al. (2011). \n\n Since it was analysed only a portion of the filter, it is needed to estimate the mass \n\nof carbon in the whole filter area. \n\nTo determine the carbonate (CO3\n2-) concentration in indoor and outdoor PM10 \n\nsamples, the same CO2 analyser of the thermal-optical system was used. The carbonate \n\nmeasurement setup comprises basically four components: a mass flow meter, a reaction \n\ncell, the CO2 analyser, and a computer terminal for data acquisition. A portion of each \n\nfilter with diameter 9 mm was punched. This fraction was subsequently dipped in an acid \n\nmedium to covert the carbon carbonate to CO2, which is then detected by the infra-red \n\nanalyser. The acidifying agent used was phosphoric acid (H3PO4) 20%, which, as a \n\nsolution wispy volatile, represents less danger for the entire system. The setup used for \n\nanalysis of the carbonate is shown in Figure 1.19. \n\n \n\n\n\n 50 \n\nFigure 1.19. Carbonate system analyser. \n\n \n\n The method includes placing of approximately 15 ml of acid in a clean flask. The \n\nflask is sealed with a stopper, which has a sample holder. The stopper is pierced by two \n\ntubes, one of them allowing the nitrogen inlet (carrier gas) and the other one providing the \n\noutput to the gas analyser. These tubes are controlled by two valves, which promote the \n\ntransfer between the cell reaction and a short circuit, avoiding cell reaction. Once the filter \n\nis placed on the holder, a purge to eliminate CO2 inside the impinge flask is done (long \n\ncircuit). The purge is maintained until the moment when the CO2 analyser registers a \n\nconcentration of zero. Then, carrier gas is passed through the short circuit and the filter is \n\ndropped in the acid solution. After 3 minutes (reaction time), the gas carrier is transferred \n\nto the long circuit and all the CO2 evolved is detected by the analyser (Almeida, 2009). The \n\ncarrier gas flow rate used was approximately 200 ml min-1. This flow is defined according \n\nto two factors. The first factor is the rate at which the gas reaches the analyser to determine \n\nthe type of peak obtained. The second factor is the intensity of the flow rate. If it is used a \n\nflow rate very high, it is possible that some droplets of acid solution contact with the filter \n\nin the sample holder before starting the reaction after the purge. The system was calibrated \n\nwith solutions with known concentrations of carbonate. Three filters impregnated with \n\nthree different standards were used to check the reliability of the CO2 analyser readings.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 51 \n\n1.7.8 Water soluble inorganic ions \n \n\n The water soluble inorganic ions in PM10 were analysed by ion chromatography. \n\nThe separation taking place in this method is based on different tendencies of the ionic or \n\nionised compounds from the sample to carry out an exchange with ions present in the \n\nstationary matrix. The separation is due to competition between the ions in the sample and \n\ncounter-ions from the stationary matrix. Basically, the analyser consist of an integrated \n\nsystem that includes an adjustable flow rate pump, an injection valve, an exchange column, \n\na differential detector and a data acquisition terminal. The sample is introduced into the \n\nupstream zone of the separation column (stationary phase) and then dragged by the solvent \n\n(mobile phase) until the separation of components in different areas. The signal differential \n\ndetector measures the instantaneous concentrations. It represents the total amount of each \n\ncomponent present in the analysed samples. The set of signals (peaks) is sent by the \n\ndetector to the differential data acquisition terminal constructing a chromatogram.  \n\nIn this work, Dionex AS14 and CS12 chromatographic columns with Dionex AG14 \n\nand CG12 guard columns coupled to Dionex AMMS II and Dionex CMMS III \n\nsuppressors, respectively for anions and cations, have been used (Figure 1.20).  \n\n\n\n 52 \n\n \n\nFigure 1.20. Ion exchange chromatographic system. \n\n \n\n \n\n To make the extraction of the water soluble inorganic material, a known portion of \n\neach filter was cut and introduced into small plastic containers previously cleaned. The \n\ncontainers were washed, dipped in ultra-pure water and sonicated during 15 min. This \n\nprocedure was repeated three times. The samples were extracted in 2.5 or 2 ml of ultra-\n\npure water (varying with the campaign) by sonication for 15 minutes. After this, the \n\nsamples were transferred to the vials, previously cleaned as described for the containers, \n\nusing Acrodisc\u00ae syringe filters (0.45 \u00b5 m pore). The amount of solution to be analysed was \n\nsplit in two portions: one part for anion analysis, and other part for cation analysis. The \n\nsame procedure was done for some blank filters. Sets of multi-cation and anion standards \n\nwere prepared from a stock solution with 1000 mg l-1 for each ion. This method made \n\npossible to identify and quantify three anions (chlorides (Cl-), nitrates (NO3\n-), and \n\nsulphates (SO4\n-2)), and five cations (sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+) and \n\n\n\n 53 \n\ncalcium (Ca2+). The concentration of each ion in each sample was obtained through the \n\nindividual calibration curves  \n\n \n\n \n\n1.7.9 Organic speciation \n \n\n To identify and quantify the organic compounds present in the PM10, it was \n\nnecessary to separate the constituents with analytical interest from a mixture by dissolving \n\nin a solvent where only those constituents are soluble. This process is called extraction. \n\nThe organic constituents of PM10 were extracted from filters by refluxing 300 ml of \n\ndichloromethane (DCM from Fischer Scientific) for 24 hours. Some filters were combined \n\nto meet the limits of detection from speciated organic compounds. During this process, the \n\nfilters were placed with the solvent in a round-bottom flask connected to a condenser. \n\nUnder heating, the solvent boils and a water cooled condenser prevents vapours from \n\nescaping, enabling the recovery of the solvent (Figure 1.21). The liquid extraction of a \n\nsolid matrix results in dilution of the sample in a large volume of solvent. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.21. Heating blankets, glass flasks with samples and DCM, and condensers.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 54 \n\n After extraction, the DCM was first subjected to filtration to remove pieces of \n\nfilters (Figure 1.22). Filter pieces were then extracted 3 times with 75 ml of methanol for \n\n10 min, each extraction, in an ultrasonic bath. Then the solvent was concentrated to a \n\nvolume of about 4 ml using a rotary evaporator (IKA HB10 basic and Laborota 4002 \u2013 \n\nDigital) at a constant temperature bath of 33\u00b0C (Figure 1.23). The second extraction step \n\nwith methanol aims at increasing the efficiency of removal of polar compounds. The \n\nefficiency increased from approximately 70%, when a simple extraction with DCM is \n\ndone, to more than 90%, when subsequent extractions with methanol combined with DCM \n\nare performed. The total organic extract was transferred to vials and then subjected to a \n\nstream of nitrogen at low flow, to dry it up.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.22. Filtration of the organic extracts and concentration of the solvent in a rotary \n\nevaporator (IKA HB 10 basic and Laborota 4002 \u2013 Digital, respectively).  \n\n \n\nThe dry total organic extracts were subjected to a fractionation procedure by flash \n\nchromatography in a silica gel column. This technique uses eluents of increasing polarity \n\nin order to separate different families of organic compounds present in the sample. The \n\nlaboratorial setup includes glass pear-shapedround flasks to collect the eluents and a \n\nnitrogen-pressurised glass column (30\u00d70.7 cm) with adsorbent material (1.5 g of silica gel \n\n3-6 mm (from Panreac), previously activated at 150\u00b0C during 3 hours). A needle valve is \n\nused to regulate the nitrogen flow through the column (Figure 1.23). The vial, containing \n\n\n\n 55 \n\nthe total organic extract, was washed three times with different mixtures of eluents for each \n\nfraction of interest, subjected to mechanical agitation by vortex (Heildolph Vortex Mixer) \n\nand the mixture was transferred to the top of the silica column. The following solvents \n\nwere used to elute the different compound classes: (1) 15 ml n-hexane (from Fisher \n\nScientific) [fraction 1, aliphatics]; (2) 15 ml toluene\u2013n-hexane (9.6 + 5.4 ml, from Lab \n\nScan and Fisher Scientific) [fraction 2, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]; (3) 15 \n\nml n-hexane\u2013dichloromethane (7.5 + 7.5 ml, from Fisher Scientific) [fraction 3, carbonyl \n\ncompounds]; (4) 20 ml ethyl acetate\u2013n-hexane (8 + 12 ml, from Merck and Fisher \n\nScientific) [fraction 4, n-alkanols, sterols and other hydroxyl compounds]; and (5) 30 ml \n\nsolution of pure formic acid in methanol (4%, v/v, from Merck and Sigma Aldrich) \n\n[fraction 5, acids and sugars]. The different fractions were passed successively through the \n\nsilica column with the help of a nitrogen stream. For each fraction collected in pear-shaped \n\nflasks, the solvent was concentrated on the same rotary evaporator used after extraction, \n\napproximately up to 2 ml, maintaining the bath temperature at about 33\u00b0C. Then, the \n\nresulting extracts were transferred to 1.8 ml vials and dried under a nitrogen stream. \n\nRecovery efficiency tests for several compounds can be found in Alves (2001), Carvalho \n\n(2003), and Oliveira et al. (2007). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.23. Flash chromatography in a silica gel column to separate compounds based on \n\ndifferences in polarity.  \n\n\n\n 56 \n\n \n\n \n\nFractions 4 and 5 followed a derivatisation process before the chromatographic \n\nanalysis. Thus, both fractions were subjected to a silylation procedure. Silylation is one of \n\nthe most used modes of derivatisation, due to the fact that there are a wide variety of \n\nchemical agents available. The N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) has \n\nbeen widely used as a reagent for silylation, because its products are enough volatile, rarely \n\ninterfering with the analyte peaks in the chromatograms. For GC-MS analysis, the addition \n\nof trimethylchlorosilane groups (TMCS) to polar compounds gives thermal and chemical \n\nstability, as well as an increase in volatility (Evershed, 1993). The silylation of fractions 4 \n\nand 5 was carried out by adding BSTFA:TMCS (99:1) (Supelco 33149-U) at a ratio of 1:1 \n\n(one part of internal standard in pyridine to one part of BSTFA:TMCS solution in each \n\nvial) with subsequent heating to 70 \u00b0C for 3 hours in an oven. \n\nGC-MS is the union between a gas chromatographer and a mass spectrometer. GC \n\ncan separate volatile and semi-volatile compounds with great resolution but can not \n\nidentify them. MS can provide detailed structural information on most compounds such \n\nthat they can be exactly identified, but it can not separate those (Hites, 1997). Figure 1.24 \n\nshows a schematic representation of a GC-MS. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1.24. Scheme representing a GC-MS.  \n\n\n\n 57 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe fractionated extracts were analysed with a GC model 6890, quadrupole MSD 5973 \n\nfrom Hewlett Packard (fractions 4 and 5), and a GC Trace Ultra, quadrupole DSQ II from \n\nThermo Scientific (fractions 1 and 2), both equipped with TRB-5MS 60 m\u00d70.25 mm\u00d70.25 \n\n\u00b5m columns. Fraction 3 was not analysed because in previous works it was found that \n\ncarbonyl compounds in the particulate phase are not relevant since most carbonyls are \n\nsemi-volatile (B\u00e1ez et al., 2001; Grosjean et al., 2002; Ho et al., 2002; Pang et al., 2006; \n\nPang and Lewis, 2011). Data were acquired in the electron impact (EI) mode (70 eV). The \n\noven temperature programme was as follows: 60 \u00b0C (1 min); 60\u2013150\u00b0C (10\u00b0C min?1), \n\n150\u2013290\u00b0C (5\u00b0C min?1), 290\u00b0C (30 min) and using helium as carrier gas at 1.2 ml min?1. \n\nThe injection was made in the splitless mode. The GC-MS system was accurately \n\ncalibrated using about 150 high purity compounds in different concentration levels with \n\nRRF determined individually for the majority of compounds. The RRF were determined in \n\na similar way, as described for VOCs. All samples and authentic standards were injected \n\nwith two internal standards: tetracosane-D50 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1-chlocohexadecane \n\n(Merck). Additionally, the EPA 8270 semi-volatile internal standard mix (Supelco), \n\ncontaining six deuterated compounds (1,4-dichlorobenzene-d4, naphthalene-d8, \n\nacenaphthene-d10, phenanthreme-d10, chrysene-d12, and perylene-d12), has been used for \n\nPAH analysis. A detailed description of the analytical methodology, including recovery \n\nefficiency tests for several compounds, can be found in Alves and Pio (2005) and Oliveira \n\net al. (2007). This methodology was previously tested in our laboratory (Alves, 2001; \n\nCarvalho et al., 2003). Compound identification was based on comparison of resulting \n\nspectra with mass spectra libraries (Wiley 275 and NIST MS Search 2.0), co-injection with \n\nauthentic standards and analysis of fragmentation patterns. HP ChemStation (Hewlett \n\nPackard) and Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific) softwares were used for integration.  \n\n \n\n1.8 References \n\n \n\nAg\u00eancia Portuguesa do Ambiente, 2009.

RISK FACTORS AND PREVALENCE OF ASTHMA AND \nRHINITIS AMONG PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN IN LISBON \n \n\nPublished \n\nPegas, P.N., Alves, C.A., Scotto, M.G. , Evtyugina, M., Pio, C.A., Freitas, M.C., 2011. \n\nRisk factors and prevalence of asthma and rhinitis among primary school children in \n\nLisbon. Revista Portuguesa de Pneumologia, 17, 109-116.  \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nAims: A cross-sectional study was carried out with the objective of identifying nutrition \n\nhabits and housing conditions as risk factors for respiratory problems in schoolchildren \n\nin Lisbon.  \n\nMaterial and Methods: Between October and December 2008, parents of 900 students \n\nof the basic schools of Lisbon were invited to answer a questionnaire of the \n\nInternational Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood Program (ISAAC). The \n\nresponse rate was 40%. Logistic regression was used in the analysis of results. \n\nResults: The prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis and wheeze was 5.6%, 43.0% and \n\n43.3%, respectively. Risk factors independently associated with asthma were wheezing \n\nattacks, and dry cough at night not related to common cold in the last 12 months. \n\nWheezing crises were found to affect children daily activities. Risk factors for wheeze \n\nwere hay fever and the presence of a pet at home. A risk factor for rhinitis was cough at \n\nnight. The frequent consumption of egg was also associated with increased risk of \n\nrhinitis.  \n\nConclusion: Contrarily to asthma, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis and wheeze \n\nincreased in comparison with previous ISAAC studies. Wheezing attacks were \n\nassociated with asthma and hay fever was identified as a risk factor of manifesting \n\nwheezing symptoms. Having pets at home was pointed out as a significant risk factor \n\nfor rhinitis, but not smoking exposure, mould, plush toys, diet (except egg \n\nconsumption), breastfeeding or other conditions.  \n\nKey-words: asthma, rhinitis, wheeze, questionnaire, children.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 82 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 83 \n\n2.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nAsthma and allergic diseases are the leading cause of chronic illness in children \n\nand, for unknown reasons, are progressively increasing (Baena-Cagnani, 2001; Bateman \n\nand Jithoo, 2007; Beasley et al., 2000; Galassi et al, 2006; Pearce et al., 2007; Pl\u00e1cido, \n\n2004). Although recent studies have shown that the genetic factors predispose people to \n\nallergic diseases (Mapp, 2003; Sandford et al., 1996; Steinke et al., 2008), the \n\nenvironmental factors have a significant influence on their occurrence and progression. \n\nSuch factors include air pollution and several domestic triggers (Bjorksten, 2004; Dong \n\net al., 2008; Salo et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2004). The lifestyle, including the type of \n\ndiet in early childhood, also plays an utmost role (Kim et al., 2009; Pawlinska-Chmara \n\net al., 2008; Vellinga et al., 2002). As a consequence of diverse interactions between \n\ngenetic and environmental risk factors, the prevalence rates show inconsistent results \n\naround the world (Bazzazi et al., 2007; Barraza-Villarreal et al., 2001; Devenny et al., \n\n2004; Grize et al., 2006; Hasnain et al., 2009; ISAAC, 1998a, b; Leung et al., 1997; \n\nOwayed et al., 2008; Romano-Zelekha et al., 2007; S\u00e1nchez-Lerma et al., 2009; Vries et \n\nal., 2009; Waked et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2006). Written respiratory symptom \n\nquestionnaires intended to determine the prevalence of asthma and allergies in children \n\nhave been extensively used in epidemiological studies (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2005; Hong et \n\nal., 2003; Ma\u00e7\u00e3ira et al., 2005; Redline et al., 2004; Richardson et al., 2006). The \n\nInternational Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) was the first \n\ninvestigation carried out worldwide using standardised questionnaires in order to \n\ngenerate a consistent global map of childhood allergy (Asher et al., 1995; ISAAC, 1998 \n\na, b). Portugal joined the ISAAC in 1993 with 5 local study centres (Lisbon, Oporto, \n\nCoimbra, Portim\u00e3o and Funchal) questioning 13-14 year old children. In 3 of these \n\ncentres (Lisbon, Portim\u00e3o and Funchal), 6-7 year old children were also studied (Pinto \n\net al., 2006; Trindade et al., 1999). Besides the current trends in the prevalence of \n\nchildhood asthma and asthma-like symptoms, the ISAAC program concluded that \n\nfurther population studies are urgently needed to discover more about the underlying \n\nmechanisms and the burden of these conditions.  \n\n\n\n 84 \n\nWith the objective of determining prevalence and risk factors of asthma and \n\nallergic diseases in Lisbon schoolchildren, as well of comparing the results with \n\nprevious data obtained through the same protocol, a questionnaire-based study was \n\nconducted in elementary schools of the Portuguese capital city. Research on potential \n\nrisk factors of asthma and allergic diseases can enhance our understanding of \n\ngeographic differences and inform decisions on preventive strategies. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.2 Material and Methods \n\n \n\nElementary school children were selected as the target population. Twenty two \n\nschools with a wide geographical coverage representing the Lisbon urban area were \n\ninvited for participation in the study (Khan et al., 2007). Fourteen schools accepted to \n\ntake part in the investigation. After obtaining consent from the school authorities, two \n\nclassrooms from each school were selected for an indoor air quality monitoring program \n\n(Pegas et al., 2010a, b). A questionnaire, accompanied by an explanatory letter, was \n\ndistributed to 900 children in every selected classroom. The questionnaire used in this \n\nstudy is the Portuguese version of the ISAAC program and had to be filled out by the \n\nparents. The questionnaire was adapted to facilitate the parents\u2019 responses, taking out \n\nsome questions about medicine consumption, which did not constitute the objective of \n\nthis study. The survey took place between October and December 2008 comprising \n\nchildren aged 5-12 years. A total of 342 questionnaires were returned. They included \n\nquestions on the frequency of respiratory symptoms and allergy occurrence in the child, \n\nphysical activity, socio-demographic characteristics, housing conditions, and other \n\npossible sources of indoor air pollution (Table 2.1). Among the factors related to \n\nlifestyle, particular attention was paid to the child\u2019s exposure to tobacco smoke, the way \n\nof feeding the child during the first months of its life (breast-feeding, artificial milk \n\nfeeding), and the current type of diet. The manually written answers were transferred to \n\na computer, codified, and confirmed by two independent persons. Multivariate logistic \n\n\n\n 85 \n\nregression models controlling for possible confounders were used to evaluate variables \n\nassociated with asthma and allergic symptoms, and adjusted odds ratios (ORs and 95% \n\nconfidence intervals, CI) were calculated. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 - Questions in the questionnaire used in this study  \n\nWheezing  Has your child ever had wheezing or whistling in the chest at any \ntime in the past? \n\n Has your children had wheezing or whistling in the chest in the last \n12 months? \n\n How many attacks of wheezing has your child had in the last 12 \nmonths? \n\n How often, on average, has your child\u2019s sleep been disturbed due to \nwheezing in the last 12 months? \n\n Has your child\u2019s chest sounded wheezy during or after exercise in the \nlast 12 months? \n\nAsthma Has your child ever had asthma? \n\nNocturnal dry \ncough \n\nHas your child\u2019s chest sounded wheezy during or after exercise in the \nlast 12 months? \n\nRhinitis  Has your child ever had sneezing or a runny/blocked nose when \nhe/she did not have a cold or flu?  \n\n Has your child had sneezing or a runny/blocked nose when he/she did \nnot have a cold or flu in the last 12 months? \n\n Have nasal symptoms interfered with your child\u2019s daily activities in \nthe last 12 months? \n\nHay fever Has your child ever had hay fever? \n\nAlimentary \nhabits \n\nWhat were the eating habits for meat, fish, fruit, vegetables, cereals, \npasta, bread, rice, butter, margarine, dry fruits, potatoes, milk, eggs \nand fast-food in the last 12 months?  \n\nBreastfeeding Has your child had been breastfeeding? \n\nSports Does your child practise some sport activities? \n\n How many times for week does your child do exercise until to be \npuffy  \n\nHouse Fuel type used for cooking; use of indoor clothes airer dryers; \n\n\n\n 86 \n\ncharacterisation \nand habits \n\nhousehold coal use for cooking or space heating; intensity of heavy \nvehicle traffic in the street; use of heating devices; signs of flooding, \nwater damage or mould growth (any surfaces other than floor); \ncontact with household pets or farm animals; presence of plush toys \n(e.g. teddy bears) in the bedroom; type of bedroom flooring and \nfinishing. \n\nParents\u2019 \nsmoking habits \n\nSmokers in regular contact with the child (mother, for example, \ngrandparents or baby-sitters); number of daily smokers of cigarettes \nin the child\u2019s home; paternal or maternal smoking while living in the \nhome with their children. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3 Results  \n\n \n\nThe sample population comprised 342 schoolchildren between 5 and 12 years, \n\nalthough 92% of the total was included in the age group of 6-8 years. No dimorphic \n\ndifferences were found concerning the frequency of allergies, therefore no division by \n\ngender was applied in further analysis. The percentage of children with wheezing or \n\nwhistling in the chest was 43.3%. Asthma prevalence was 5.6%. Symptoms of allergic \n\nrhinitis were reported for 42.9% of children.  \n\nAlmost 9.5% of children were born abroad. The proportion of parents with \n\nelementary education degree was 20%, 56% reported having a secondary degree and \n\n20% were university graduates. Housing characteristics of respondents were evaluated \n\n(Table 2.2): about 33% of the families lived near streets with heavy traffic, 23% used \n\ndrying clothes airers and indoor drying racks for the drying of washing and laundry, and \n\nonly 3% of children's bedrooms had carpeting. Gas use as a cooking fuel was asserted \n\nby 84% of respondents. Almost 23% of the families stated having a furry pet at home, \n\nwhereas 62% reported plush toys in the child's bedroom. The appearance or detection of \n\nmoulds and water damage within the past 12 months occurred in 19% of the homes, and \n\n23% of children had been exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during the first year \n\nof life. More than half of all children lived with one or more smokers in their homes. \n\n \n\n\n\n 87 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 2.2 - Housing characteristics and environmental factor exposure in children living in \nLisbon. \n\nHousing \ncharacteristics \n\nDefinition % \n\nCooking equipments cooking fuel type: \n\n- electricity \n\n- gas \n\n- other \n\n \n\n 5.6 \n\n83.9 \n\n0.0 \n\nIndoor laundry \ndrying \n\nThe use of indoor clothes airer dryers 22.8 \n\nIndoor coal use The use of coal in a household for cooking or space \nheating \n\n 0.0 \n\nPollution source near \nthe house \n\nheavy vehicle traffic in the street: \n\n- all day long \n\n- frequently \n\n- rarely \n\n- never \n\n \n\n 9.6 \n\n23.7 \n\n47.9 \n\n17.5 \n\nUse of home heating \ndevices \n\nthe use of any of the following heating devices:  \n\n- electricity \n\n- gas \n\n- wood \n\n- other \n\n \n\n43.3 \n\n12.6 \n\n 9.4 \n\n 1.7 \n\nMould in the past 12 \nmonths  \n\nsigns of flooding, water damage or mould growth (any \nsurfaces other than food) \n\n19.0 \n\nPet keeping refers to the feeding in a household dogs, cats or farm \nanimals: \n\n- cats in the past 12 months \n\n- cats in the first year of life \n\n \n\n10.8 \n\n 8.5 \n\n\n\n 88 \n\n- dogs in the past 12 months \n\n- dogs in the first year of life \n\n- contact during the first year of life with farm \nanimals \n\n22.8 \n\n 9.3 \n\n12.9 \n\nPlush toys  presence of plush toys (e.g. teddy bears) in the \nbedrooms \n\n62.3 \n\nBedroom flooring types of bedroom flooring: \n\n- carpet \n\n- wooden \n\n- tiled \n\n- other \n\n \n\n 2.6 \n\n70.5 \n\n14.3 \n\n 8.2 \n\nBedroom walls types of bedroom finishes: \n\n- painting \n\n- wallpaper \n\n \n\n95.0 \n\n0.6 \n\nEarly-life exposure to \ntobacco smoke in \nthe 1st year \n\nsmokers in regular contact with the child (mother, for \nexample, grandparents or baby-sitters) \n\n \n\n23.0 \n\nCurrent smokers in \nthe household \n\nnumber of daily smokers of cigarettes in the child\u2019s \nhome: \n\n- none \n\n- one \n\n- two \n\n- three \n\n- four or more \n\n \n\n43.9 \n\n35.1 \n\n15.8 \n\n 2.6 \n\n 2.0 \n\nParents smoking paternal or maternal smoking while living in the home \nwith their children: \n\n- mother \n\n- father \n\n \n\n30.4 \n\n36.5 \n\n  \n\n\n\n 89 \n\nThe results of the logistic regression analysis reveal that the questions \u201cHow \n\nmany wheezing attacks did your child had during the past year?\u201d and \u201cHas your child \n\nhad ever dry cough at night not associated with common cold in the last 12 months?\u201d \n\nare statistically significant predictors of asthma. Concerning the first question, the \n\nestimate of  the probability of occurrence of childhood asthma is 10 times superior for \n\nthe answer category \u201c1 to 3\u201d (one to three wheezing attacks in the past year) than for \n\nthose responding \u201cnone\u201d (ODs=10.07; CI=2.98, 33.96). Children in the category \u201c4 to \n\n12\u201d have approximately a 20 times higher chance of developing the disease compared \n\nwith those in the category \u201cnone\u201d (ODs=19.88; CI=4.22, 93.54). Occurrence of dry \n\ncough at night increases by almost 6 times the probability of asthma manifestation \n\n(ODs=5.77; CI=1.20, 27.70).  \n\nFor the variable represented by the question \u201cDuring the last 12 months, have \n\nthe wheezing problems affected your child\u2019s daily activities?\u201d, the odds ratio between \n\nthe category \u201cdid not affect daily activity\u201d and the category \u201cdaily activity affected a \n\nlittle\u201d is 2.55 (CI=1.28, 5.08). This means that the point estimate of the probability of \n\noccurrence of wheezing is 2.55 higher for those responding \u201cdid not affect\u201d than for \n\nthose answering \u201caffected a little\u201d. The odds ratio between the categories \u201cdid not affect \n\ndaily activity\u201d and \u201cdaily activity affected moderately\u201d is approximately 27 (CI=6.17, \n\n126.36). The point estimate of the probability of occurrence of wheezing is 13 times \n\nhigher for positive answers to \u201cHas your child ever had hay fever?\u201d (ODs=13.02; \n\nCI=1.52, 109.5). (CI=1.27, 10.57). Children who had a pet in their home during the last \n\n12 months appear to have a higher risk of developing wheezing symptoms (ODs= 3.66; \n\nCI=1.27, 10.57).  \n\nThe occurrence of dry cough at night not associated with common cold in the \n\nlast 12 months was also positively associated with rhinitis (ODs= 2.77; CI=1.19, 6.44). \n\nThe point estimate of the probability for allergic rhinitis is approximately 145 times \n\nhigher among children with sneezing crisis, runny nose or nasal congestion not \n\nassociated with common cold in relation to those without these symptoms (ODs= \n\n145.47; CI=53.53, 395.28). Among diet variables, the only statistical significant \n\nrelationship found was for egg consumption, with frequent egg eaters having a 90% \n\nhigher risk for allergic rhinitis than those that were not (OR = 0.10, CI =0.01, 0.54).  \n\n\n\n 90 \n\n2.4 Discussion \n\n \n\nThe male to female ratio for the diagnosis of asthma has narrowed considerably \n\nin the past 35 years, with almost complete disappearance of the previous male \n\npredominance (Devenny et al., 2004). In comparison with previous studies in Portugal, \n\nschoolchildren living in Lisbon show a trend to reduction in the current prevalence of \n\nasthma (Table 2.3). This might be explained by a better control of the disease through \n\neducational measures and improved preventive treatment to better control of the disease, \n\ntaking into account that more children are now using inhaled corticosteroids. These \n\nfindings are sustained by other studies that used the ISAAC questionnaire (Romano-\n\nZelekha et al., 2007). The ISAAC found the greatest prevalence of asthma in Australia \n\nand New Zealand (29.7%), followed by North America (24.4%) and Latin America \n\n(17.0%) (Baena-Cagnani et al., 2001). In contrast to our study, a trend towards an \n\nincrease in asthma has been observed in other regions: Taiwan (Lee et al., 2007), United \n\nKingdom (Devenny et al., 2004), Hong Kong (Leung et al., 1997), US (Eggleston, \n\n2007), Australia (Wilson et al., 2006), Brasil (Fiore et al., 2001), Austria (Schernhamme \n\net al., 2008), and Spain (Garc\u00eda-Marcos et al., 2004). However, signs indicative of a halt \n\nin the rising trend in asthma prevalence have been found in other recent investigations \n\n(Fleming et al., 2000; Owayed et al., 2008; Romano-Zelekha et al., 2007; Ronchetti et \n\nal., 2001; Toelle et al., 2004; Zollner et al., 2005). According to Bazzazi et al. (2007) it \n\nis unresolved why the disparities in the prevalence of asthma and allergic disorders are \n\nso large. Two overlapping though competing theories have related changes in \n\nenvironmental factors to observed trend profiles in asthma and allergy epidemiology. \n\nThe oldest theory, the \u201chygiene hypothesis\u201d, claims that modifications in the infectious \n\nenvironment and in the pattern of microbial exposure of children associated with \n\nwesternisation are decisive factors contributing to the increasing severity and prevalence \n\nof atopic disorders. According to this theory, environmental exposures that promote a \n\ngeneralised suppression of Th2 cytokines and trigger strong Th1 responses are \n\nbecoming progressively less common (Strachan, 1989). The most recent theory, the \n\n\u201cimmunotolerance hypothesis\u201d, claims that early high levels of exposure to allergens \n\n\n\n 91 \n\nreduce risk by potentiating the regulatory capacity of the immune system (Platts-Mills \n\net al., 2001). \n\n \n\nTable 2.3 - Prevalence of allergy symptoms worldwide (values are given in %). \n\n Asthma Allergic \n\nrhinitis \n\nWheeze References \n\nEuropean \n\ncountries \n\n    \n\nLisbon, \n\nPortugal \n\n5.6 43.0 43.3 This study \n\nOporto, \n\nPortugal \n\n11.9 12.9 18.3 Falc\u00e3o et al.

(2006) \n\n \n\nChildren with sneezing crisis, runny nose or nasal congestion not associated with \n\ncommon cold were 43.0%. Regarding the last year rhinitis prevalence in this age group, \n\nit was estimated to be 39.5%. The prevalence of this allergic disease in Lisbon is greater \n\nthan the mean estimated national prevalence. Since Portugal is a country with diverse \n\n\n\n 93 \n\ngeographic areas, the divergent prevalence ratios obtained in different cities can be \n\nexplained by the type of weather, the level of air pollution and the diverse levels of \n\ncontact to allergens. Lee et al. (2007) surveyed an increased prevalence of allergic \n\nrhinitis among children in Hong Kong from 1995 to 2001. The same rising trend was \n\nobserved among Israeli adolescents (Romano-Zelekha et al., 2007). In Brazil, last year \n\nrhinitis prevalence in schoolchildren and adolescents was found to fall in wide ranges: \n\n1.5-41.8% and 3.2-66.6%, respectively (Sol\u00e9 et al., 2006). In Italy, the prevalence of \n\nrhinitis symptoms in the past 12 months increased from 13.8 to 18.9% and from 31.6 to \n\n35.1% among children (6-7 years old) and adolescents (13-14 years old), respectively, \n\nbetween 1994 and 2002 (Galassi et al., 2006). \n\nThe proportion of children with respiratory symptoms reporting wheeze \n\nexperienced a significant increase between 1993/94 and 2008 (Table 2.3). However, the \n\nprevalence of wheezing symptoms in the last 12 months was only 15%. The worldwide \n\nprevalence of current wheeze studied in 155 centres ranged from 2.1 to 32.2% (ISAAC, \n\n1998b). In Australia, a 26% decrease in wheezing in the past 12 months was found in \n\nyounger children between 1993 and 2002 (Robertson et al., 2004). In Spain, the \n\nprevalence of current wheeze in 13-14 year old children did not change from 1994-1995 \n\nto 2002-2003 (Garc\u00eda-Marcos et al., 2004). In Belgium, there was no clear change in \n\nasthma, but wheeze decreased from 1996 to 2002 (Vellinga et al., 2002). Several other \n\nstudies from Great Britain, Germany, Italy and Denmark conducted in the last decade \n\nreported dissimilar findings of an increase in the prevalence of asthma and of wheeze in \n\nthe past 12 months (Devenny et al., 2004; Galassi et al., 2006; Maziak et al., 2003; \n\nThomsen et al., 2004). \n\nFrequent consumption of egg was also associated with increased risk of \n\nrespiratory symptoms among schoolchildren in Taipei (Tsai and Tsa, 2007). Allergic \n\nreactions to food are either immunoglobulin (IgE) mediated or non-IgE-mediated. \n\nPersons who are hereditarily predisposed to atopy produce specific IgE antibodies to \n\ncertain proteins to which they are exposed.  These antibodies bind to mast cells and \n\nother cells in body tissues and to basophiles circulating in the blood stream. When a \n\nfood protein is ingested, the IgE recognises it on the surface of these cells; mediators \n\n(e.g., histamine) are released, and symptoms arise. Besides the skin and gastrointestinal \n\n\n\n 94 \n\ntract, the symptoms of IgE-mediated reactions usually involve the respiratory system \n\n(Sicherer, 1999). Eggs are among the food most commonly causing these allergic \n\nreactions in children.  \n\nNo associations with any of the other dietary factors were found. A significant \n\nprotective effect of breastfeeding against current respiratory allergies in children was \n\nnot observed in this study. Besides pets, no statistically significant relationship was \n\nfound with other housing conditions.  \n\nOur study had some limitations; namely recalling bias in cross-sectional \n\nquestionnaires and the lack of objective laboratory measures. However, most estimates \n\nof asthma, wheeze and rhinitis have been based on data from questionnaires with \n\nquestions concerning symptoms or preceding physician diagnosis.  \n\n \n\n2.5 Conclusions \n\n \n\nContrarily to asthma, a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of \n\nrhinitis and wheeze was observed among primary schoolchildren in Lisbon. Differences \n\nin prevalence obtained in several studies may point out exposure to different risk \n\nfactors, as well as variable racial, environmental, and socioeconomic conditions, \n\nheterogeneous diagnostic criteria, or a true increase in the prevalence of allergic \n\ndiseases. In this study, wheezing attacks were associated with asthma and hay fever was \n\nidentified as a risk factor of manifesting wheezing symptoms. Children with dry cough \n\nat night should be evaluated for both rhinitis and asthma, and a combined strategy \n\nshould be ideally used to treat the upper and lower airway diseases in terms of efficacy \n\nand safety. Having pets at home was pointed out as a significant risk factor for rhinitis, \n\nbut not smoking exposure, mould, plush toys, diet (except egg consumption), \n\nbreastfeeding or other conditions. The results support the observation that deep changes \n\nin the epidemiologic dynamics of asthma and allergic diseases are occurring worldwide, \n\ndemanding ample, continuous, epidemiologic monitoring. Future studies, such as birth \n\ncohorts, are warranted to evaluate risk and protective factors and to continue surveying \n\nthe features of the prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases in Portugal. Research on \n\n\n\n 95 \n\npotential risk factors of asthma and respiratory allergies can enhance our understanding \n\nof geographic differences and support decisions on preventive strategies.  \n\n \n\n2.6 References \n\n \n\nAl Frayh, A.R., Shakoor, Z., Gad El Rab, M.O., Hasnain, S.M., 2001.

Outdoor/Indoor air quality in primary schools in Lisbon: \n\na preliminary study. Qu\u00edmica Nova, 33, 1145-1149. \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nSimultaneous measurements of outdoor and indoor pollution were performed at three schools \n\nin Lisbon. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), formaldehyde and NO2 were passively \n\nmonitored over a two-week period. Bacterial and fungal colony-forming units and comfort \n\nparameters were also monitored at classrooms and playgrounds. The highest indoor levels of \n\nCO2 (2666 \u00b5 g m\n-3), NO2 (40.3 \u00b5 g m\n\n-3), VOCs (10.3 \u00b5 g m-3), formaldehyde (1.03 \u00b5 g m-3) and \n\nbioaerosols (1634 CFU m-3), and some indoor/outdoor ratios greater than unity, suggest that \n\nindoor sources and building conditions might have negative effects on air indoors. Increasing \n\nventilation rates and use of low-emission materials would contribute towards improving \n\nindoor air quality.  \n\nKeywords: indoor air quality, VOCs, formaldehyde.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n 108 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n\n\n 109 \n\n3.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nOutdoor air quality has become of growing concern during the past 50 years, because \n\nof increasing traffic and industrial emissions. However, evidence has been found that citizen \n\nspend most of their time in buildings and are far more exposed to pollution indoors than \n\noutdoors (Blondeau et al., 2005). \n\nIn Lisbon, the number of children with asthma and rhinitis represents, respectively, \n\nabout 15% and 40% of the school-age population (Khan et al., 2007a) and almost nothing is \n\nknown about indoor air quality (IAQ) in schools. Mendell et al. (2002) observed that health \n\nproblems from poor indoor environments may reduce the performance of occupants in \n\nbuildings. According to Mendell and Heath (2005), indoor environments in schools need to be \n\nstudied with the aim of finding connections between IAQ and performance or attendance, due \n\nto two primary reasons: \n\n\u2022 Schools are seen as particularly likely to have environmental deficiencies because chronic \n\nshortages of funding contribute to inadequate operation and maintenance of facilities. \n\n\u2022 Children have greater susceptibility to some environmental pollutants than adults, because \n\nthey breathe higher volumes of air relative to their body weights and their tissues and organs \n\nare actively growing. In addition, a child\u2019s immune system is not fully developed. \n\nCurrently, children also spend more time in school than in any indoor environment other \n\nthan their home.  \n\nPersuasive evidence links higher indoor NO2 concentrations to reduced school \n\nattendance and low ventilation rates to reduce performance. Concerning indirect associations, \n\nsome studies link indoor dampness and microbiologic pollutants to asthma exacerbations and \n\n\n\n 110 \n\nrespiratory infections, which in turn have been related to reduced performance and attendance \n\n(Kim et al., 2007; Mendell and Heath, 2005). \n\nThe first aim of this preliminary study was to measure comfort parameters, CO2, \n\nbacterial and fungal contamination and gaseous inorganic and organic pollutants in indoor and \n\noutdoor air of three schools in winter. The second aim was to study associations between \n\nthese factors and possible sources inside or outside the schools. As far as we know, this is the \n\nfirst IAQ monitoring study in schools of Lisbon. \n\n \n\n3.2 Experimental \n\n \n\n3.2.1 Schools Description \n\n \n\nIndoor and outdoor air samples were collected at three schools (183, SJB and SJ) in \n\nLisbon (Portugal), in December 2008. These schools were located in the city centre and were \n\npreviously considered representative of all the elementary-level educational institutions (Khan \n\net al., 2007a, b). Two classrooms from each of the three schools were selected for this study. \n\nOne of the classrooms of both 183 and SJB schools always had the electric heating connected \n\nand closed windows. This classroom of the 183 School presented activities of arts with paints \n\nand glue in one day during the sampling; the other classrooms had windows and doors opened \n\nfrequently. In the SJ School, both classrooms were always shut. All the classrooms depend \n\nonly on the natural ventilation through the doors and windows existent. Details of each \n\nsampling site are listed in Table 3.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n 111 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.1 - Characteristics of each school \n\n  183 SJB SJ \n\nEnvironment Urban  Urban Urban \n\nHeating Yes Yes No \n\nVentilation Windows/Doors \n\nType of board Blackboard and \nchalk \n\nWhite board with \npen \n\nBlackboard and \nchalk \n\nFloor Ceramic tile \n\nMaterial of desks \nand chairs \n\nWood, plywood, plastic and metal \n\nPlants Outdoor Outdoor Indoor/Outdoor \n\nAnimals No Yes No \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Sampling and Analysis \n\n \n\nPollutants and parameters of interest were carbon dioxide (CO2), temperature, relative \n\nhumidity (RH), total VOCs, bacterial and fungal colony-forming units per cubic metre, NO2, \n\nspeciated VOCs and formaldehyde. Continuous measurements of temperature, relative \n\nhumidity (RH), CO2 and total VOCs were performed with an automatic portable Indoor Air \n\nIQ-610 Quality Probe (GrayWolf\u00ae monitor) in one classroom of each school. This IAQ \n\nmonitor includes a Pt100 probe for measuring temperature, a capacitance probe to sense RH \n\nand a CO2 non-dispersive infrared sensor, all of them with an extremely fast response. The \n\nmonitor also includes a photo-ionisation detector to track total VOCs over time. It displays \n\nmeasurements in real time allowing logged data to be downloaded to WolfSense\u00ae PC \n\nsoftware for analysis. The equipment was supplied with a factory calibration certificate, but it \n\n\n\n 112 \n\nis checked prior to next use with appropriate calibration kits. Based on their results, it was \n\nexpected to evaluate the contribution of ventilation, combustion processes, tobacco smoke \n\nand traffic for the IAQ. Bacterial and fungal colony-forming units per cubic metre of air were \n\nmonitored by liquid impinger sampling in the two classrooms and playgrounds during one \n\nday in each school selected (May and Harper, 1957). Passive samplers for VOCs, \n\nformaldehyde and NO2 were used for the simultaneous measurements of indoor (in one \n\nclassroom of each school) and outdoor levels. At each point, samples were collected in \n\nduplicate. NO2 concentrations were passively monitored for a two-week period. The diffusive \n\ntubes (with steel grids impregnated with triethanolamine) chemiadsorb NO2, as nitrite, which \n\nwas quantified by visible spectrophotometry (Bhugwant and Hoareau, 2003). Passive \n\nsamplers for VOCs and formaldehyde from Radiello\u00ae (www.radiello.com) were used to \n\nobtain a screening of heavy and light molecular weight compounds over a two-week period. \n\nIndoor passive samples were collected at a height of about 1.5 m above the floor. They were \n\npositioned at a distance that should exceed 1 m from a window or a door. Outdoor passive \n\nsamples were collected at heights of about 2 m above the ground. VOCs adsorved in activated \n\ncharcoal cartridges were recovered by 2 ml of carbon disulfide (CS2) with the internal \n\nstandard, during 30 minutes. Analyses were performed by gas chromatography (Chrompack \n\nCP 9001) coupled to a flame ionisation detection (GC/FID), using nitrogen carrier gas at \n\nconstant pressure of 20 psi.9 A 100% dimethylpolysiloxane column (0.2 mm, 50 m, film \n\nthickness 0.5 \u00b5m) was used under the following temperature program: 50oC for 5 minutes, \n\n5oC min-1 up to 80oC, 15oC min-1 up to 135oC, 20oC min-1 up to 220oC, final isotherm for 20 \n\nminutes. Injector and detector temperatures were 240oC and 300oC, respectively. The \n\nequipment was calibrated before and during the analyses of samples by injecting standard \n\nsolutions of all compounds identified in CS2, specifically: pentane, n-hexane, ciclohexane, n-\n\nheptane, n-butyl acetate, styrene, ?-pinene, sabinene, ?-pinene, n-decane, (+)-3-carene, \n\n\n\n 113 \n\nlimonene (all from Fluka), methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isooctane, m,p-xylene, o-xylene (all \n\nfrom Merck), benzene (AnalytiCals), toluene (Lab-Scan), and ?-terpinene (Aldrich). Four \n\nstandard solutions, each one containing five compounds in CS2, have been prepared. The \n\nanalytes in these four standard solutions were present in concentrations of 40 ng \u00b5l-1, 20 ng \u00b5l-\n\n1, 10 ng \u00b5l-1 and 5 ng \u00b5l-1. \n\nFormaldehyde collected in the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in sampling cartridges \n\nreacted to give the corresponding 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones. The analytes were extracted \n\nwith 2 ml of acetronitrile and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). \n\nThe analytical system consisted of a Jasco PU- 980 pump, a Rheodyne manual injection valve \n\n(sample loop of 20 \u00b5l), a Supelcosil LC-18 column (250\u00d74.6mm; 5\u00b5 m; Supelco) and a Jasco \n\nMD-1510 diode array detector, all connected in series. Isocratic elution at room temperature \n\nwas performed using an acetonitrile/water solution (60/40, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow \n\nrate of 1.5 ml min-1. The carbonyl concentrations were quantified with external calibrations \n\ncurves constructed from standard solutions of formaldehyde-DNPH derivative in acetonitrile \n\n(www.radiello.com; U.S.EPA, 1997). After compilation of data, the different environments \n\nwere compared with the aim of finding a relation between indoor and outdoor pollutants and \n\nthe possible compound sources. \n\n \n\n3.2.3 Evaluation of the Chromatographic Analysis \n\n \n\nParameters, such as selectivity, linearity, reproducibility and limit of detection, were \n\nevaluated by twelve injections of three standard solutions of ten compounds with three \n\nconcentrations each one, between 5 ng \u00b5l-1 and 40 ng \u00b5l-1. The selectivity of an instrumental \n\nseparation method refers to the ability to discriminate between the analyte and interfering \n\n\n\n 114 \n\ncomponents (Ribani et al., 2004). As condition for the method selectivity, the absence of \n\npeaks in the region of the retention time for the investigated compounds was observed. \n\nLinearity is the ability to elicit test results that are directly proportional to the concentration of \n\nanalytes in samples within a given range (Ribani et al., 2004). The repeatability measures are \n\nthe success rate in successive experiments conducted by the same experimenters. It was \n\nevaluated from the calculation of the standard deviation of the chromatographic peak areas \n\ncorresponding to 10 - 12 injections, each day, in 5 successive days. The limit of quantification \n\n(LOQ) represents the lesser concentration of the substance in examination that can be \n\nquantitatively analysed with reasonable reliability. Limit of detection (LOD) represents the \n\nlesser concentration of the substance in examination that can be detected, but it is not \n\nnecessarily quantified by a method. The LOQ and LOD have been calculated as described in \n\nRibani et al. (2004).  \n\n \n\n3.3 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n3.3.1 Results of the Evaluation of the Chromatographic Analysis  \n\n \n\n The chromatographic analyses of samples exhibited good selectivity and separation \n\ncapability of analytes. After multiple injections of different concentration standard solutions, \n\nit was observed that the plots of peak areas, as a function of analyte mass, produced \n\nregression lines that had an intercept not significantly different from 0 and Pearson correlation \n\ncoefficients ranging from 0.958 to 0.999 (Table 3.2). Consecutive injections of the same \n\nsample under variable conditions showed repeatability among measurements. The maximum \n\n\n\n 115 \n\nstandard deviation did not exceed 0.04 (Table 3.2). Depending on the analyte, LOQ and LOD \n\nwere in the ranges 1.04-7.64 ng \u00b5l-1 and 0.34-2.52 ng \u00b5l-1, respectively (Table 3.2). \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.2. - Average relative response factor, standard deviation (STDEV), linearity, limit of \ndetection and limit of quantification for each compound.    \n\nCompounds Average \nRRF* \n\nSTDEV Pearson correlation \ncoefficients \n\nLOD** \n(ng \u00b5l-1) \n\nLOQ*** \n(ng \u00b5l-1) \n\nEthyl acetate 0.27 0.01 0.999 2.52 7.64 \n\nCiclohexane 0.82 0.02 0.999 1.35 4.10 \n\nIsooctane 0.89 0.02 0.996 1.06 3.22 \n\nn-Heptane 0.97 0.02 0.958 1.03 3.11 \n\nToluene 1.15 0.02 0.999 0.74 2.25 \n\nInternal \nstandard \n\n1.00 0.00 0.999 1.06 3.21 \n\no-Xylene 1.28 0.04 0.999 0.43 1.31 \n\n?-Pinene 1.23 0.04 0.999 0.38 1.15 \n\nn-Decane 1.20 0.04 0.999 0.34 1.04 \n\nLimonene 1.15 0.04 0.999 0.38 1.14 \n\n* RRF (relative response factor) = (area of compound/mass of compound)*(area of internal standard/mass of internal \nstandard); \n\n**LOD (limit of detection) = 3.3(s/S), where s is the STDEV of areas and S is the slope; \n\n***LOQ (limit of quantification) = 10(s/S), where s is the STDEV of areas and S is the slope. \n\n \n\n3.3.2 Air Quality Monitoring Data \n\n \n\nThe average room temperature for the three schools was 20\u00baC\u00b11.4oC, and the relative \n\nhumidity presented values between 52 and 61%. These high indoor relative humidity values \n\n\n\n 116 \n\nare not surprising since, according to the Environment Portuguese Agency, the Lisbon region \n\nusually records values between 75 and 85%. It should be stated that higher relative humidity \n\nvalues contribute to the survival and the dispersion of airborne allergens such as mould spores \n\nand bacteria, worsening the symptoms of allergy suffers. \n\nCarbon dioxide concentrations are often used as a surrogate of the rate of outside \n\nsupply air per occupant. Indoor CO2 concentrations above approximately 1000 \u00b5 g l\n-1 are \n\ngenerally regarded as indicative of ventilation rates that are unacceptable with respect to body \n\nodours (ASHRAE, 1999). The National System for Energy and Indoor Air Quality \n\nCertification of Buildings (Regulamento dos Sistemas Energ\u00e9ticos de Climatiza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nEdif\u00edcios \u2013RSECE) (RSECE, 2006) establishes an acceptable maximum value (AMV) of CO2 \n\nof 1800 \u00b5 g l-1 for buildings in Portugal. The indoor concentrations of CO2 showed inadequate \n\nclassroom air exchange rates. Figure 3.1 depicts the variation of indoor CO2 concentrations in \n\na typical working day at the three schools. A strong correlation of the CO2 level with \n\noccupancy has been observed. CO2 spikes were even more pronounced when students started \n\nphysical activities inside the classrooms, as for example, art classes or entrance and exits to \n\nthe playgrounds. Room 12 of the 183 School presented the greatest CO2 concentration (2666 \n\n\u00b5 g l-1). This room was the only one that had the electric wall heating constantly connected and \n\nwindows and doors always closed. Lower outdoor air ventilation rates at homes have been \n\nassociated with increased prevalence of asthma and allergic symptoms in children (Bornehag \n\net al., 2005). \n\n\n\n 117 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Indoor carbon dioxide levels in the three schools. \n\n \n\nNo standards have been agreed upon for nitrogen oxides in indoor air in Portugal. \n\nASHRAE (ASHRAE, 1999) and the U.S. EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards list \n\n0.053 ppm as the average 24-hour limit for NO2 in outdoor air. NO2 concentrations were \n\nhigher outdoors than indoors (Table 3.3), probably as a result of vehicular exhaust emissions \n\nfrom nearby traffic. The I/O NO2 ratio ranged between 0.63 and 0.84. SJ School, which is \n\nlocated near an avenue with intense traffic, presented the smallest level of indoor NO2, \n\npossibly because the windows and the doors were always closed.  \n\nTable 3.3 - . Indoor and outdoor NO2 concentrations (\u00b5 g m\n-3) in the three schools.  \n\n Indoor Outdoor Indoor/Outdoor \n\nSJB School 40.3 48.0 0.84 \n\nSJ School 36.4 56.9 0.64 \n\n183 School 37.1 44.4 0.83 \n\n \n\n\n\n 118 \n\nIn the SJ and SJB Schools, the total fungal colony-forming units in both indoor and \n\noutdoor air (Figure 3.2) were below the acceptable maximum value (AMV) of 500 CFU m-3 \n\ndefined by the Portuguese Legislation, Decree-Law 79/2006. In the 183 School, fungal \n\ncolony-forming units higher than this standard were observed in both indoor and outdoor air. \n\nFungal species exceeding 500 CFU m-3 may be indicative of building-related sources, poor \n\nventilation rates or overcrowding, highlighting the need for remedial action (Godish, 1995).  \n\n Excepting for the outdoor measurements of SJ School, the total bacteria colony-\n\nforming units presented values above 500 CFU m-3 for all the environments. The main factors \n\naffecting atmospheric dispersion and survival of microorganisms are the relative humidity, \n\ntemperature, oxygen, wind and air turbulence, air pollutants and water and nutrient \n\navailability. The high amounts of bacteria in both indoor and outdoor may derive from several \n\nfactors, including high seasonal level of bioaerosols in outdoor air, from the human self-\n\nactivities, such as breathing, sweating and movement causing particle resuspension. Cold \n\nweather favours children\u2019s respiratory infections, which are usually caused by bacteria or \n\nvirus. Thus, respiratory morbidity among children may also contribute to the airborne spread \n\nof bioaerosols.  \n\n\n\n 119 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Average of total bacteria and fungal colony-forming units per cubic metre of air \nand standard deviation. \n\n \n\n \n\n Two institutions presented indoor/outdoor (I/O) fungal ratios in the range 0.45-0.86, \n\nwhile values higher than 1 have been registered for the SJ School. Depending on classroom, \n\nvariable I/O bacterial ratios, ranging from 0.62 and 1.95, have been found. Scheff et al.(2000) \n\nreported that, in a middle school of Springfield, the indoor fungal and bacterial counts were \n\nsignificantly higher than the outdoor concentrations. Conversely, Godwin and Batterman \n\n(2006) found that the outdoor bioaerosol levels exceeded indoor levels in 64 school \n\nclassrooms in Michigan. \n\nTotal VOC concentrations could give information about the influence of aerosol \n\nsprays, solvents, cleaning agents, pesticides, paints and repellents. Figure 3.3 shows a daily \n\nprofile for the total VOC concentrations. SJ and SJB Schools exhibit very constant levels and \n\n\n\n 120 \n\nsimilar daily patterns. In the 183 School, there was a huge increase in the VOC concentrations \n\naround 13 pm, when pupil\u2019s art class was occurring with the use of glue and paints. This \n\nmakes evident that collage and painting materials increase the VOC levels in indoor air. \n\nZhang et al.(2006) also identified a visual art classroom with a relatively high level of VOCs. \n\nStandards have been agreed upon for total VOCs by Decree 79/2006 of the Portuguese \n\nLegislation that establishes the thermal regulations for buildings (RSECE, 2006). The results \n\nobtained in schools were above the proposed target guideline value of 600 \u00b5g m-3. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013 Diurnal variation of total VOCs (non-methane hydrocarbons) in the three schools. \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.4 present the results for the VOC concentrations and speciation. In general, \n\nconcentrations of VOCs were higher indoors than outdoors for all schools. Those compounds \n\nthat have only been detected in indoor air have a probable indoor source. Ethyl acetate, \n\n\n\n 121 \n\nmethyl acetate, styrene, ethanol and limonene were only found in the indoor air. Pollutants \n\nidentified in both indoor and outdoor samples, but with higher concentrations in the indoor \n\nenvironments, may indicate additional indoor sources or inadequate ventilation ratios. I/O \n\nratios higher than 1 were observed for n-hexane, n-heptane, n-butyl-acetate and o-xylene at all \n\nthe schools. I/O ratios exceeding the unity were also determined for pentane, toluene ?-\n\npinene, n-decane and terpinene, but not in all institutions. The measured benzene \n\nconcentrations were below the annual ambient EU limit value of 5 \u00b5g m-3. Toluene \n\nconcentrations were higher than those reported by Stranger et al. (2008) in primary schools of \n\nAntwerp, Belgium. The high benzene and toluene concentrations observed in Lisbon are in \n\nthe same range of those measured in schools of Oporto, Portugal (Madureira et al., 2009). In \n\nthis preliminary study, the toluene levels were very similar to those found in schools of \n\nCuritiba, Brazil (Godoi et al., 2009). \n\n \n\nTable 3.4 - VOC concentrations (\u00b5 g m-3) in the three schools. \n\nSJB School 183 School SJ School COMPOUNDS \n\nIndoor Outdoor Indoor Outdoor Indoor Outdoor \n\nPentane 3.61 0.71 0.97 1.08 1.40 1.13 \n\nMethyl acetate 52.0 ni 34.0 ni 83.0 Ni \n\nEthyl acetate 2.08 ni 1.30 ni 3.55 Ni \n\nn-Hexane 2.98 0.53 1.15 0.62 1.06 0.84 \n\nBenzene 2.88&lt;ld 3.01 3.13 2.54 2.46 \n\nCiclohexane 0.87 0.22 0.17 0.13 1.60 0.16 \n\nIsooctane 1.19 0.15 0.16 0.19 0.44 0.21 \n\nn-Heptane 3.22 0.37 3.35 0.50 0.95 0.52 \n\nToluene 10.3 2.00 2.51 2.58 4.59 2.93 \n\nn-Butyl acetate 4.18 0.62 1.41 0.87 6.74 1.42 \n\n\n\n 122 \n\nm,p-Xylene 8.8 1.22 1.42 1.26 2.82 1.78 \n\nStyrene ni ni ni ni 0.28 Ni \n\no-Xylene 3.09 0.39 1.05 0.46 5.45 0.57 \n\n?-Pinene 0.50 ni 0.15 ni 4.27 0.16 \n\nSabinene 0.77 ni ni 0.14 12.2 0.17 \n\n?-Pinene ni ni ni ni 29 Ni \n\nn-Decane 1.00 0.40 0.46 0.30 1.71 0.65 \n\n(+)-3-Carene ni ni ni ni 0.24 Ni \n\n?-Terpinene 0.65 ni ni 0.18 0.78 0.23 \n\nLimonene 3.17 ni 0.39 ni 86 Ni \n\nld \u2013 below limit of detection; ni \u2013 not identified. \n\n \n\nSJ School, which has the oldest building among all institutions, registered both the \n\nhighest concentrations and diversity of VOC compounds. Perhaps the inadequate ventilation \n\nobserved favours accumulation of pollutants with additional indoor sources. The highest \n\nlevels of limonene, ?-pinene, sabinene, n-butyl acetate, methyl acetate and formaldehyde \n\n(1.03 \u00b5 g m-3) were achieved in this school. n-Hexane, n-heptane and n-decane could have \n\nindoor sources in some architectural finishes, floor adhesives, PVC flooring, consumer \n\nproducts (e.g. floor waxes and aerosol air fresheners). Limonene could be derived from \n\ncleaning products, air fresheners and many other consumer products. Benzene, toluene, \n\nxylenes and styrene could be originated from engine vehicle exhaust, gasoline/fuel, tobacco \n\nsmoke, solvent-based paints, floor adhesives, PVC flooring, carpeting, printed material and \n\nsolvent-based consumer products (Mendell, 2007). The 183 School registered the lowest \n\nconcentrations of VOCs, probably because this institution had better ventilation than the other \n\nschools, higher classroom volumes and lesser number of pupils. \n\n \n\n\n\n 123 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nIndoor and outdoor concentrations of NO2, VOCs, formaldehyde and microbiological \n\ncomponents were measured for the first time in three elementary schools in Lisbon during \n\nDecember 2008. The results suggest that schools with closed windows could have smaller I/O \n\nratios of NO2 (0.64), but higher indoor levels of VOCs (10.3 \u00b5 g m\n-3) and formaldehyde (1.03 \n\n\u00b5 g m-3) with an origin in building materials and consumer products. Total VOC \n\nconcentrations increase during art classes, reaching about 2200 \u00b5 g m-3. Low ventilation ratios \n\nand the children\u2019s physical activities have also an impact upon the CO2 levels. Fungal and \n\nbacterial counts exceeding 500 CFU m-3 for one school (765 CFU m-3) and for all of them \n\n(934-1634 CFU m-3), respectively, may be indicative of building-related sources, poor air \n\nexchange rates or overcrowding, highlighting the need for remedial action. Most of the \n\nassessed gaseous pollutants can be credited to the traffic emissions and indoor sources (some \n\narchitectural finishes, floor adhesives, PVC flooring, consumer products and cleaning \n\nproducts). More studies are needed (currently underway), to find additional possible sources \n\nof indoor contamination; to calculate air exchange rates on a seasonal basis, to evaluate if \n\nthere is a causal relationship between pollutant exposure and health symptoms in schools, and \n\nto assess if school IAQ can adversely affect academic performance or attendance.  \n\n3.5 References \n\n \n\nASHRAE, 1999.

INDOOR AIR QUALITY IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF LISBON \nIN SPRING  \n \n\nPublished \n\nPegas, P.N., Alves, C.A., Evtyugina, M., Nunes, T., Cerqueira, M., Franchi, M., Pio, C., \n\nAlmeida, S.M., Canha, N., Freitas, M.C., 2011. Indoor air quality in elementary schools of \n\nLisbon in spring. Environmental Geochemistry and Health, 33, 455-468.  \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nIndoor air quality (IAQ) in schools usually presents higher levels of pollutants than outdoor \n\nenvironments. The aims of this study were to measure indoor and outdoor concentrations of \n\nNO2, speciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbonyls at fourteen primary \n\nschools in Lisbon (Portugal). The investigation was carried out in May-June 2009. Three of \n\nthe schools were selected to also measure comfort parameters, such as temperature and \n\nrelative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), total VOCs, and bacterial \n\nand fungal colony-forming units per cubic metre. The indoor concentrations of CO2 in the \n\nthree main schools indicate inadequate classroom air exchange rates. The indoor/outdoor \n\n(I/O) NO2 ratio ranged between 0.36 and 0.95. At the three main schools, the total bacterial \n\nand fungal colony-forming units (CFU) in both indoor and outdoor air were above the \n\nadvised maximum value of 500 CFU m-3 defined by the Portuguese legislation. The \n\naromatic compounds benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, followed by ethers, \n\nalcohols and terpenes, were usually the most abundant classes of VOCs. In general, the \n\nindoor total VOC concentrations were markedly higher than those observed outdoors. In all \n\nplaces, the indoor aldehyde levels were higher than those observed outdoors. This is \n\nparticularly valid for formaldehyde. The inadequate ventilation observed likely favours \n\naccumulation of pollutants with additional indoor sources. \n\nKey words: carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbonyls, indoor air quality, nitrogen \n\ndioxide, schools, volatile organic compounds.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 130 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 131 \n\n4.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nHuman exposure is the event when a person comes into contact with a pollutant of a \n\ncertain concentration during a certain period of time (Ott et al., 2007). This means that \n\nexposure requires both the pollutant and the person to be present. People can be exposed to \n\ncontaminants by inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact. In the past, scientists have paid \n\nmuch attention to the study of exposure to outdoor air contaminants because they have \n\nrealised the seriousness of outdoor air pollution problems. However, each indoor micro-\n\nenvironment is uniquely characterised, which is determined by the local outdoor air, specific \n\nbuilding characteristics and indoor activities. Consequently, each individual\u2019s personal \n\nexposure will be determined by the different indoor micro-environments to which the \n\nperson is exposed to, and the permanence time in each (Stranger et al., 2007).   \n\nMany studies are being conducted on indoor air pollution because most people spend \n\na lot of their time indoors living, working, and studying (Lee et al., 2001a, 2002a, b; Li et \n\nal., 2001). Reports about buildings with air related problems have received increasing \n\nattention since the seventies (Hodgson, 1992; Spangler and Sexton, 1983). Sick building \n\nsyndrome (SBS) is a commonly used term for symptoms resulting from problems with \n\nindoor air quality (IAQ). Complaints common to SBS include allergic rhinitis, headaches, \n\nflu-like symptoms, watering of eyes, and difficulty in breathing (Mishra et al., 1992). The \n\nfirst official study about SBS that examined more than one structure was published in 1984 \n\n(Finnigan et al., 1984). \n\nIAQ problems in schools may be even more serious than in other categories of \n\nbuildings, due to higher occupant density and insufficient outside air supply, aggravated by \n\nfrequent poor construction and/or maintenance of school buildings. Therefore, odour and \n\ncomfort complains have been related to IAQ problems in schools, as well as increased \n\nincidence of allergic, asthma and infectious diseases. Poor IAQ can also affect scholarly \n\nperformances and attendance, since children are more vulnerable than adults to health risk \n\nfrom exposure to environmental hazards (Daisey et al., 2003; Godoi et al., 2009). The \n\nsignificance of IAQ in schools is underscored by the large number of worldwide studies: \n\nBlondeau et al. (2005), Chew et al. (2005), Godoi et al (2009), Godwin and Batterman \n\n(2007), Griffiths and Eftekhari (2008), Hodgson et al. (2004), Kim et al. (2007), Klinmalee \n\n\n\n 132 \n\net al. (2009), Lee and Chang (2000), Meklin et al (2002),  Mukerjee et al. (2009), Shendell \n\net al. (2004), Sohn et al. (2007), Stranger et al. (2008),  Zhang et al (2006). However, most \n\nof these studies concentrate on a specific group of pollutants or on thermal conditions. \n\nMultidisciplinary indoor field campaigns, measuring a wide range of health relevant \n\nchemical and physical properties, are still missing. Lisbon, the number of children with \n\nasthma and rhinitis is about 15% and 40%, respectively (Pl\u00e1cido, 2004), and the school \n\nwork environment has not received much attention. Therefore, IAQ in Portuguese schools is \n\nalmost unknown.  \n\nThe main aims of this work were: (a) to measure indoor comfort parameters \n\n(temperature, relative humidity, CO, CO2 and total VOCs) and bacterial and fungal \n\ncontamination in three representative schools; (b) to evaluate VOCs, carbonyls and NO2 \n\ngaseous pollutants, by passive sampling, in indoor and outdoor air at 14 schools, and (c) to \n\nidentify possible sources, activities or other conditions contributing to the measured levels.  \n\n \n\n4.2 Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n4.2.1 Description of Schools \n\n \n\nIndoor and outdoor air samples were collected at fourteen schools with a wide \n\ngeographical coverage representing the Lisbon urban area, in May and June 2009. Two \n\nclassrooms from each of the fourteen schools were selected for this study. All the \n\nclassrooms depend only on the natural ventilation through the doors and windows existent. \n\nDetails of each sampling site are listed in Table 4.1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 133 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Characteristics of each school. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.2.2 Comfort parameters and airborne microorganisms  \n\n \n\nFor comfort parameters and airborne microorganisms three of the fourteen schools \n\nwere selected: schools A, B and C. These schools were previously considered representative \n\nof all the elementary-level educational institutions (Khan et al., 2007a, b). Continuous \n\nmeasurements of temperature, relative humidity (RH), CO2 and total VOCs were performed \n\nwith an automatic portable Indoor Air IQ-610 Quality Probe (GrayWolf\u00ae monitor) in one \n\nclassroom of each school during the 8 hour occupancy periods. This IAQ monitor includes a \n\nPt100 probe for measuring temperature, a capacitance probe to sense RH and a CO2 non-\n\ndispersive infrared sensor, all of them with an extremely fast response. The monitor also \n\nincludes a photo-ionisation detector to track total VOCs over time. It displays measurements \n\nin real time allowing logged data to be downloaded to WolfSense\u00ae PC software for analysis. \n\nThe equipment was supplied with a factory calibration certificate, but it is checked prior to \n\nnext use with appropriate calibration kits. Indoor CO2 levels are an indicator of the \n\nadequacy of outdoor air ventilation relative to indoor occupant density.  \n\n\n\n 134 \n\nBacterial and fungal colony-forming units per cubic metre of air (CFU m-3) were \n\nmonitored by liquid impinger sampling (May and Harper, 1957) in the two classrooms and \n\nplaygrounds during one day in each one of the 3 main schools. The flow rate was set at 2.5 \n\nL min-1. In each sampling place (classrooms and playgrounds), one-hour samples were \n\ntaken. To obtain representative results, five replicates were obtained per site. \n\n \n\n4.2.3 Sampling and analysis of VOCs, carbonyls and NO2   \n\n \n\nVOCs and carbonyls were sampled in parallel using Radiello\u00ae (Fondazione \n\nSalvatore Maugeri, Padova, Italy) diffusive passive tubes (cartridges codes 130 and 165, \n\nrespectively) for 14 consecutive days. In each sampling place, for each one of these two \n\ngroups of compounds, two replicate samples were collected. Indoor samples were collected \n\nat a height of about 1.5 m above the floor. The diffusive samplers were positioned at a \n\ndistance that should exceed 1 m from a window or a door. Outdoor passive samples were \n\ncollected at heights of about 2 m above the ground. The VOC adsorbing cartridges consist \n\nof 60 mm length stainless steel net cylinders, with 100 mesh grid opening and 5.8 mm \n\ndiameter, packed with 530\u00b130 mg of activated charcoal with a particle size of 35-50 mesh \n\n(Cocheo et al., 1996). \n\nVOCs were extracted from the exposed samplers with 2 ml carbon disulfide (CS2 \n\nfrom Aldrich) containing 2-fluorotoluene (from Aldrich) as an internal standard. The glass \n\nvials were shaken for approximately 30 min. The analyses of the extracts were performed by \n\ngas chromatography (Chrompack CP 9001) coupled to a flame ionisation detector \n\n(GC/FID), using nitrogen carrier gas at constant pressure of 20 psi. A 100% \n\ndimethylpolysiloxane column (0.2 mm, 50 m, film thickness 0.5 \u00b5m) was used. The \n\ntemperature program was as follows: 50oC for 5 minutes, 5oC min-1 up to 80oC, 15oC min-1 \n\nup to 135oC, 20oC min-1 up to 220oC, final isotherm for 20 minutes. Injector and detector \n\ntemperatures were 240oC and 300oC, respectively. The equipment was calibrated before and \n\nduring the analyses of samples by injecting standard solutions of all compounds identified in \n\nCS2, specifically: pentane, n-hexane, ciclohexane, n-heptane, n-butyl acetate, styrene, ?-\n\npinene, sabinene, ?-pinene, n-decane, (+)-3-carene, limonene (all from Fluka), methyl \n\nacetate, ethyl acetate, isooctane, m,p-xylene, o-xylene (all from Merck), benzene \n\n\n\n 135 \n\n(AnalytiCals), toluene (Lab-Scan), and ?-terpinene (Aldrich). Four standard solutions, each \n\none containing five compounds in CS2, have been prepared. The analytes in these four \n\nstandard solutions were present in concentrations of 40 ng \u00b5l-1, 20 ng \u00b5l-1, 10 ng \u00b5l-1 and 5 \n\nng \u00b5l-1. The limit of detection was calculated for ethyl acetate, ciclohexane, isooctane, n-\n\nheptane, toluene, n-decane and limonene. Depending on the analyte, the limit of detection \n\n(LOD= 3.3(s/S), where s is the STDEV of areas and S is the slope), ranged from 0.34 to \n\n2.52 ng \u00b5l-1 (Pegas et al., 2010). This corresponds to environmental concentrations between \n\n0.27 and 2.97 \u00b5g m-3. \n\nCarbonyls collected in cartridges filled with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reacted to \n\ngive the corresponding 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones. These were extracted with 2 ml of \n\nacetonitrile (from Fisher Scientific). The glass vials were shaken for approximately 30 min \n\nand the extract filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m disc membrane filters (filtration kit RAD 174) and \n\ninjected into the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The analytical \n\nsystem consisted of a Jasco PU- 980 pump, a Rheodyne manual injection valve (sample \n\nloop of 20 \u00b5 l), a Supelcosil LC-18 column (250\u00d74.6mm; 5\u00b5 m; Supelco) and a Jasco MD-\n\n1510 diode array detector, all connected in series. Isocratic elution at room temperature was \n\nperformed using an acetonitrile/water solution (60/40, v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate \n\nof 1.5 ml min-1. The carbonyl concentrations were quantified with external calibrations \n\ncurves constructed from standard solutions of TO11/IP6A carbonyl \u2013 DNPH Mix (from \n\nSupelco). The limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 1.29 to 2.09 \u00b5g ml-1, depending on the \n\nanalyte. \n\nNO2 concentrations were also passively monitored for fourteen days. The diffusive \n\ntubes (with steel grids impregnated with triethanolamine) chemiadsorb NO2, as nitrite, \n\nwhich was quantified by visible spectrophotometry (Bhugwant and Hoareau, 2003). \n\n \n\n4.3 Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n4.3.1 Comfort parameters and airborne microorganisms \n\n \n\n\n\n 136 \n\nThe daily variation of comfort parameters throughout the two-week monitoring \n\nperiod was performed. To illustrate contrasting conditions, two specific days were chosen to \n\nexemplify the daily profiles. The mean daily temperature and RH values during the \n\nmonitoring period, taken at the three main schools, ranged from 21.9 \u00b1 1.09oC to 25.9 \u00b1 \n\n1.56oC and from 34.6 \u00b1 3.49% to 56.2 \u00b1 3.28%, respectively (Figure 4.1). In general, the \n\ntemperature varied between 18.6oC and 28.2oC, whereas RH was in the 25.1-66.8% interval. \n\nThermal comfort requirements differ for each individual due to factors such as clothing, \n\nactivity level, age, and physiology. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2004 describes the \n\ntemperature and humidity ranges that are comfortable for 80% of people engaged in chiefly \n\nsedentary activities. These values were conceived for adults in office environments and \n\npresume \u201cnormal indoor clothing\". The effects of moderate heat stress on the performance \n\nof office work in subjects aged 18-29 years were evaluated through questionnaires by \n\nWitterseh et al. (2004). Raised temperature increased eye, nose and throat irritation (P &lt;\n\n0.05), headache intensity (P &lt;0.05), difficulty in thinking clearly (P &lt;0.01) and \n\nconcentrating (P &lt;0.01), and decreased self-estimated performance. Usually, the \n\nrecommended indoor temperature ranges for comfort are from 20 to 23\u00baC in the winter and \n\nfrom 23 to 26\u00baC in the summer. The suggested indoor RH values for comfort are in the \n\nrange 30-60%. Control of RH also helps limit the growth of microorganisms. Maintaining \n\nRH below 50% inhibits mould growth, dust mite infestations, and bacteria. If RH levels fall \n\nbelow 25%, building occupants can experience respiratory irritation and possibly dry, itchy \n\neyes and skin. Generally, in every school studied, the temperature and RH values were \n\nwithin the recommended ranges.  \n\n\n\n 137 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 - Indoor daily mean temperature (oC) and relative humidity (RH) (%). Bars \nindicate the standard deviations (STDEV).  \n\n \n\nThe National System for Energy and Indoor Air Quality Certification of Buildings \n\n(Regulamento dos Sistemas Energ\u00e9ticos de Climatiza\u00e7\u00e3o de Edif\u00edcios - RSECE) establishes \n\nan acceptable maximum value (AMV) of CO2 of 1800 mg m\n-3 for buildings in Portugal \n\n(RSECE 2006). CO2 levels ranged widely (705 to 6821 mg m\n-3) and exceeded 1800 mg m-3 \n\nin all the three main schools. Carbon dioxide concentrations are often used as a surrogate of \n\nthe rate of outside supply air per occupant. Indoor CO2 levels above about 1000 ppm are \n\nnormally considered as indicative of ventilation rates that are unacceptable with respect to \n\nbody odours. Concentrations of CO2 below 1000 ppm do not always guarantee that the \n\nventilation rate is adequate for removal of air pollutants from indoor sources (Daisey et al., \n\n2003). The indoor concentrations of CO2 showed inadequate classroom air exchange rates. \n\nFigure 4.2 depicts the variation of indoor CO2 concentrations in a typical working day in \n\nthe three main schools. A strong correlation of the CO2 levels with occupancy has been \n\nobserved. CO2 spikes were even more pronounced when students started physical activities \n\ninside the classrooms, such as art classes or entrance and exits to the playgrounds. Seppanen \n\n\n\n 138 \n\net al. (1999) reviewed available literature for the association between both ventilation rates \n\nand CO2 concentrations and health. The authors were not able to determine a clear threshold \n\nvalue for CO2 below which further reductions in concentration were not associated with \n\nfurther decreases in SBS symptoms. However, 7 of the 16 reviewed studies suggested that \n\nthe risk of SBS symptoms continued to decrease with decreasing CO2 concentrations below \n\n800 ppm. Mostly, CO2 measurements in schools indicate that the most classrooms probably \n\ndo not meet the ASHRAE Standard 62-1999 for minimum ventilation rate of 2.5 l s-1 per \n\nperson. Concentrations of a variety of pollutants emitted by occupants and building \n\nmaterials and furnishings will be higher under these conditions than if the ASHRAE \n\nventilation standard was met. The potential for increased risks of contracting certain \n\ncommunicable respiratory illnesses, such as influenza and common colds, in classrooms \n\nwith low ventilation rates is higher than in adequatly ventilated places (Fisk, 2001). \n\n\n\n 139 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 - Indoor carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide levels in the three main schools.  \n\n\n\n 140 \n\n \n\nCO levels ranged from 0.0 to 1.0 mg m-3 (Figure 4.2) and did not exceed 12.5 mg m-\n\n3, the recommended exposure limit (RSECE 2006). To prevent carboxy-hemoglobin levels \n\nin the blood from exceeding 2.5%, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has set specific \n\nair quality guidelines for distinct averaging periods: 100 mg m-3 (15 min), 60 mg m-3 (30 \n\nmin), 30 mg m-3 (1 h) and 10 mg m-3 (8 h) (Chaloulakou et al., 2003). CO is one of the most \n\ncharacteristic traffic pollutants usually observed in urban areas. However, in this study, \n\nconcomitant increases of CO2 and CO concentrations were observed. This suggests a linear \n\ncorrelation between both CO and CO2 (r=0.787), and a direct relationship between \n\nincreasing concentrations and classroom occupancies. CO is produced as a by product of \n\nincomplete combustion of organic materials. In the human body, CO is produced \n\nendogenously by the class of enzymes known collectively as heme oxygenase (Mines, \n\n1997). CO is detectable in small quantities in the exhaled air of health people (Zayasu et al., \n\n1997). Exhaled CO is increased in patients with inflammatory pulmonary diseases such as \n\nbronchial asthma, bronchiectasis, upper respiratory tract infections, and seasonal allergic \n\nrhinitis (Zayasu et al., 1997). This is supported by the fact that inhaled corticosteroids \n\ninhibit the increase in exhaled CO in asthmatic patients (Zayasu et al., 1997). According to \n\nJones and Lam (2006), human exposure to microenvironments with high CO levels can \n\nincrease exhaled CO concentrations. Thus, exhaled CO levels can potentially act as a \n\nfunctional indicator of air pollutant levels. In the city of Lisbon the most common sources of \n\nthe total CO emissions are vehicle exhausts (Borrego et al., 2000). Taking into account the \n\nCO levels recorded by the 3 monitoring stations close to the 3 main schools, mean I/O ratios \n\nclose to zero were obtained. The highest CO levels were registered in the school located \n\nnear one of the busiest streets of Lisbon (Avenida da Liberdade). The average daily \n\nconcentrations measured on the air quality monitoring station in this street were in the range \n\n0.36-0.52 mg m-3. Based on a comprehensive literature review, the INDEX project (Kotzias \n\net al., 2005), concluded that current CO sources in EU residences contribute essentially to \n\nshort-term, rather than long-term, exposures.  \n\nVery few measurements of total VOCs in a typical school-day are reported in the \n\nscientific literature (e.g. Pegas et al., 2009, 2010). Total VOC concentrations could give \n\ninformation about the influence of aerosol sprays, solvents, cleaning agents, pesticides, \n\npaints and repellents. The measurements ranged from L.O.D. (&lt;0.005 mg m-3) to 2.1 mg m-\n\n\n\n 141 \n\n3 and did not surpass the recommended value of 0.6 mg m-3 (RSECE 2006) (Figure 4.3). \n\nPeak concentrations of VOCs were observed around 10 A.M. at school A, on the first day, \n\ndecreasing progressively thereafter. This may be explained by the fact that, on this particular \n\nday, classrooms were cleaned with VOC-release products in the morning, before classes \n\nstart. Normally, the cleaning staff tidy up the rooms at the end of the day. An increase in \n\nconcentrations was also observed at School B during a period coincident with an art class \n\nwhere glue and paints were in use. This makes evident that collage and painting materials \n\ncan significantly enhance the VOC levels in indoor air. Zhang et al. (2006) also identified a \n\nvisual art classroom with a relatively high level of VOCs.   \n\n \n\n\n\n 142 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 - Diurnal variation of total VOCs (non-methane hydrocarbons) in the three main \nschools. \n\n\n\n 143 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.2 shows indoor and outdoor average levels of total bacterial and total fungal \n\nCFU m-3. In all schools, the total fungal and total bacterial colony-forming units in both \n\nindoor and outdoor air were above the AMV of 500 CFU m-3 defined by the Portuguese \n\nLegislation, Decree-Law 79/2006 (RSECE 2006). The main factors affecting atmospheric \n\ndispersion and survival of microorganisms are the relative humidity, temperature, oxygen, \n\nwind and air turbulence, air pollutants and water and nutrient availability. Very high levels \n\nof microorganisms were obtained in all five replicates performed for every sampling site. \n\nThe repetition of the whole experience one week apart (again with five replicates) was \n\ncarried out to confirm the huge microbial counts. It was necessary to count some quadrants \n\nof the Micropore filters (0.45 \u00b5 m) to extrapolate for all quadrants of each filter and estimate \n\nthe minimum CFU number per sample. The high amounts of bacteria in both indoor and \n\noutdoor environments may derive from several factors, including high seasonal level of \n\nbioaerosols in outdoor air (spring), and human self-activities, such as breathing, sweating \n\nand movement causing particle resuspension.  \n\nHigh bacteria counts were probably due to high occupancy loading, poor hygienic \n\ncondition of occupants, inadequate ventilation rates, movement of textiles, food products, \n\netc. (Lee et al., 2002; Mentese et al., 2009). Scheff et al. (2000) reported that, in a middle \n\nschool of Springfield, the indoor fungal and bacterial counts were significantly higher than \n\nthe outdoor concentrations. Similarly, Jo and Seo (2005) reported, for both the total bacteria \n\nand the total fungi, higher indoor concentrations compared to the outdoor environment at 11 \n\nelementary schools in Korea. Mentese et al. (2009) studied different indoor and outdoor \n\nenvironments in terms of bioaerosol contamination. The highest total bacteria counts were \n\nmeasured in kindergartens, primary schools, restaurants, high schools, and homes, while the \n\nhighest mould levels were observed in kitchens, bathrooms, and offices. Gon\u00e7alves et al. \n\n(2010) studied indoor and outdoor atmospheric fungal spores in the Sao Paulo metropolitan \n\narea (Brazil), and obtained levels above 36000 CFU. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 144 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 4.2.

Indoor \n\ntotal VOC concentrations were generally markedly higher than those observed outdoors \n\n\n\n 145 \n\n(Figure 4.4 and Table 4.3). The sum of the individual VOC concentrations in indoor air \n\nvaried from 37 to 317 \u00b5g m-3. Outdoor concentrations ranged between 6 and 80 \u00b5g m-3. In \n\ngeneral, all the different classes of VOCs presented higher concentrations indoors than \n\noutdoors. Ethanol, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloropropane, propyl acetate \n\nmethylcyclohexanol, 2,2-dimethylbutane and 4-methyl-2-pentanone were only found in the \n\nindoor air. Those compounds that have only been detected in indoor air have a probable \n\nindoor source. Pollutants identified in both indoor and outdoor samples, but with higher \n\nconcentrations in the indoor environments, may indicate additional indoor sources or \n\ninadequate ventilation ratios. For example, terpenes are well-known as emitted substances \n\nfrom cleaning products and room fresheners (Singer et al., 2006). Additionally, ?-pinene is \n\nan intrinsic component in wood and furniture (Yrieix et al., 2010). Other VOC sources in \n\nindoor air include cooking fuels, aerosols propellants, refrigerants, paints, varnishes, \n\ncosmetics, adhesives, biocides, disinfectants, printed paper, etc. (Srivastava et al., 2004). \n\nThe observed indoor levels in school C may be the reflex of inefficient ventilation \n\nconditions (windows and doors were always closed), and cooking activities in the same \n\nbuilding of the classrooms. The school E presented both the highest aliphatic hydrocarbon \n\nand ester levels in comparison with other schools, probably due to the fact that the building \n\nwas recently painted. The highest aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations were observed at \n\nschool K, more likely due to its location in a street canyon with intense traffic. \n\n\n\n 146 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 - Indoor (2 classrooms) and outdoor VOC concentrations (sum of all compounds \nidentified).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 147 \n\nTable 4.3 \u2013 Indoor and outdoor VOC and carbonyl concentration (\u00b5g m-3) in all \nschools. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 148 \n\nAmong all monitored VOCs, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) \n\nare of particular interest due to their known carcinogenic effects (Kotzias et al., 2009). \n\nIndoor and outdoor BTEX concentrations are summarised in Table 4.4. Benzene \n\nconcentrations were higher for all indoor environments, ranging from 0.2 to a maximum of \n\n0.9 \u00b5g m-3. All measurements were below the EU limit value of 5 \u00b5g m-3 for mean annual \n\nexposure to benzene. However, as it is a carcinogenic compound, the WHO has not yet \n\nestablished a guide or safe value (WHO 2000). Toluene is a ubiquitous indoor pollutant \n\n(Bruno et al., 2008). Its indoor concentrations were higher than the corresponding outdoor \n\nlevels, ranging from 0.9 to 7.3 \u00b5g m-3. Concentrations of ethylbenzene comprise values from \n\n0.3 to 14.2 \u00b5g m-3, whereas the xylene isomers, m+p-xylene and o-xylene, were in the \n\nranges 0.6 \u2013 40 \u00b5g m-3 and 0.2 \u2013 13.5 \u00b5g m-3, respectively. Results for BTEX in this study \n\ncorrelate well with those of Stranger et al. (2007), except for toluene. The high benzene and \n\ntoluene concentrations observed in Lisbon are in the same range of those measured in \n\nschools of Oporto, Portugal (Madureira et al., 2009). Toluene levels were very similar to \n\nthose found in schools of Curitiba, Brazil (Godoi et al., 2009). The BTEX levels in schools \n\nof Lisbon are far below the weekly average concentrations in non-residential indoor \n\nenvironments, such as libraries, pharmacies, offices, gymnasiums, newspaper stands, copy \n\ncentres, coffee shops, etc., in Bari, Italy (Bruno et al., 2008). BTEX values were much lower \n\nthan the WHO guidelines from 2000 (260 \u00b5g m-3 over one week for toluene and 4.8 mg m-3 \n\nover 24 h for xylenes). However, some studies have correlated exposure to low \n\nconcentrations of benzene and toluene with increased risks of cancer or eye and airway \n\nirritations (Guieysse et al., 2008).  \n\nThe highest indoor VOC concentrations were found in schools E, F, G and K. A \n\npossible indoor source in schools E and K was the vinyl flooring and floor adhesives, which \n\nare described as emitter materials, especially of benzene, toluene, xylenes, styrene, and \n\nethylbenzene, among others (Mendell, 2007). In addition to these indoor sources, the \n\ninadequate ventilation (closed windows) likely favours accumulation of pollutants. New \n\nfurniture and/or the fact of being a new building could also explain the high levels in school \n\nE. The VOC loads in school G are possibly related to the proximity to congested motorways \n\nsurrounding the city. School F is located close to an old cigarette factory, near motorways, \n\nin an area without green spaces and with urban planning deficit. These housing conditions \n\nmay have contributed to the high concentrations of ethers and alcohols. Better ventilation \n\n\n\n 149 \n\nconditions, lower occupancy density and larger classrooms in school A in relation to other \n\ninstitutions, may explain the low indoor levels observed at that school.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 150 \n\nTable 4.4 \u2013 Overview of indoor and outdoor BTEX concentration in fourteen \nschools in Lisbon. \n\n \n\nNote: - not identified \n\n\n\n 151 \n\nIn all places, the indoor concentrations of atmospheric aldehydes (formaldehyde, \n\nacetaldehyde, propionaldehyde and benzaldehyde) were higher than those outdoors. This is \n\nparticularly valid for formaldehyde (Figure 4.5), classified as a human carcinogenic by the \n\nInternational Agency for Cancer Research. Formaldehyde concentrations ranged from 1.48 \n\nto 42.3 \u00b5g m-3. Higher levels in classrooms than outdoors suggest that indoor sources are \n\nmore important contributors to the indoor levels than outdoor sources, such as infiltration of \n\nvehicle exhaust (Ongwandee et al., 2009). Formaldehyde could be originated from \n\ncomposite wood and other products with urea-formaldehyde resin, some architectural \n\nfinishes, tobacco smoke and other combustion processes (Mendel, 2007). Concentrations of \n\nformaldehyde are significantly affected by season and age of the buildings (Dingle and \n\nFranklin, 2002). It was observed that levels are higher in the presence of furniture bought \n\nnew or restored less than one year before measurements (Lovreglio et al., 2009). In spring \n\nand summer, outdoor formaldehyde levels increase due to the acceleration of the \n\nphotochemical activity (Lee et al., 2001b), while the opposite trend is observed indoors, \n\nsince the interchange rate between indoor\u2013outdoor air is higher due to open windows or the \n\nuse of air conditioning (Pilidis et al., 2009). The highest level of formaldehyde was \n\nobserved at school G. The high levels may be related to the fact that this institution is \n\nlocated in the vicinity of major motorways with very intense traffic. It should be also noted \n\nthat the ceilings were painted during the Shrovetide period and new furniture was purchased \n\njust one month before the sampling campaign. In addition, the school corridors are wood \n\ncoated. Pressed wood products use adhesive containing urea formaldehyde that can break \n\ndown, releasing formaldehyde into the air. Formaldehyde is also found as a preservative in \n\npaint. Acute symptoms from formaldehyde exposures have sometimes been found including \n\neye, nose and throat irritation, as well as lower airway and pulmonary effects (Kotzias et al., \n\n2009). Among the identified aldehydes, formaldehyde was the most abundant. However, \n\nother carbonyl compounds were also present at appreciable amounts: acetaldehyde (0.88-\n\n7.02 \u00b5g m-3), propynaldehyde (0.48-2.28 \u00b5g m-3), and benzaldehyde (0.03-0.96 \u00b5g m-3).  \n\n \n\n\n\n 152 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 - Formaldehyde concentration in all schools. \n\n \n\nAnimal and human experimental studies indicate that NO2 at short-term \n\nconcentrations exceeding 200 \u00b5g m-3 is a pollutant with significant health effects (Kraft et \n\nal., 2005). Exposure to NO2 at hourly peak levels of the order of ? 80 ppb, compared with \n\nbackground levels of 20 ppb, was associated with a significant increase of sore throat, colds \n\nand absences from school (Pilotto et al., 1997). The average NO2 concentrations were \n\nhigher outdoors than indoors (Table 4.5), probably as a result of vehicular exhaust \n\nemissions from nearby traffic. The I/O NO2 ratios ranged between 0.36 and 0.95. Indoor \n\nNO2 levels were within the interval 15 \u2013 37 \u00b5g m\n-3, not exceeding the current WHO \n\nguideline value of 40 \u00b5g m-3 (annual mean) to protect the public health. School E, which \n\npresented an outdoor concentration of 42 \u00b5g m-3, registered the lowest level of indoor NO2 \n\n(15 \u00b5g m-3), possibly because the windows and the doors were always closed. An average \n\nNO2 concentration of 39 \u00b5g m\n-3 was registered in classrooms in Taiyuann, China (Zhao et \n\nal., 2008). Levels varying from 9.5 to 23 \u00b5g m-3 and from 11 to 19 \u00b5g m-3 were obtained, \n\nrespectively, in the indoor air and outside of elementary schools in Curitiba, Brazil (Godoi \n\n\n\n 153 \n\net al., 2009).  Lee and Chang (2000) found indoor and outdoor NO2 levels ranging from 12 \n\nto 176 \u00b5g m-3 and 19 to 244 \u00b5g m-3, respectively, for five classrooms at different schools in \n\nHong Kong.  \n\nTable 4.5 \u2013 Indoor and outdoor NO2 concentrations in fourteen schools in \nLisbon. \n\n \n\n \n\n4.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nIndoor and outdoor concentrations of NO2, VOCs, carbonyls, microbiological \n\ncomponents and comfort parameters (temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO2), \n\ncarbon monoxide (CO) and total VOCs) were measured in fourteen basic schools in Lisbon. \n\nThe concentration of CO2 and bioaerosols greatly exceeded the AMV of 1800 mg m\n-3 and \n\n500 CFU m-3, respectively, perhaps due to overcrowded classrooms and inefficient \n\nventilation. Schools located near traffic busy streets presented the highest outdoor (45.7 \u00b5g \n\nm-3) and the lowest indoor (29.6 \u00b5g m-3) NO2 levels, possibly because the windows and the \n\ndoors were always closed. Generally, the assessed VOCs occurred at I/O ratios above unity, \n\n\n\n 154 \n\nshowing the important influence of indoor sources and building conditions in IAQ. Most of \n\nthe gaseous pollutants can be credited to the traffic emissions and indoor sources (some \n\narchitectural finishes, floor adhesives, PVC flooring, consumer products and cleaning \n\nproducts). Better ventilation should be provided for these public buildings and air cleaners \n\nshould be used in order to improve children\u2019s health, and their performance. More studies \n\nare needed (currently underway) to find additional possible sources of indoor \n\ncontamination, to calculate air exchange rates on a seasonal basis, to evaluate if there is a \n\ncausal relationship between pollutant exposure and health symptoms in schools, and to \n\nassess if school IAQ can adversely affect academic performance or attendance. \n\n \n\n4.5 References \n\n \n\nANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2004, 2004.

SEASONAL EVALUATION OF OUTDOOR/INDOOR AIR \nQUALITY IN PRIMARY SCHOOLS IN LISBON  \n \n\nPublished \n\nPegas, P., Alves, C.A., Evtyugina, M., Nunes, T., Cerqueira, M., Franchi, M., Pio, C., \n\nAlmeida, S.M., Cabo Verde, S., Freitas, M.C., 2011. Seasonal evaluation of outdoor/indoor \n\nair quality in primary schools in Lisbon. Journal of Environmental Monitoring, 13, 657-\n\n667.  \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the indoor (I) and outdoor (O) levels of NO2, \n\nspeciated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbonyls at fourteen primary schools in \n\nLisbon (Portugal) during spring, autumn and winter. Three of these schools were also \n\nselected to be measured for comfort parameters, such as temperature and relative humidity, \n\ncarbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), total VOCs, and both bacterial and fungal \n\ncolony-forming units per cubic metre. The concentration of CO2 and bioaerosols greatly \n\nexceeded the acceptable maximum values of 1800 mg m-3 and 500 CFU m-3, respectively, \n\nin all seasons. Most of the assessed VOCs and carbonyls occurred at I/O ratios above unity \n\nin all seasons, thus showing the importance of indoor sources and building conditions in \n\nindoor air quality. However, it has been observed that higher indoor VOC concentrations \n\noccurred more often in the colder months, while carbonyl concentrations were higher in the \n\nwarm months. In general, the I/O NO2 ratios ranged between 0.35 and 1, never exceeding \n\nthe unity. Some actions are suggested to improve indoor air quality in Lisbon primary \n\nschools. \n\nKey words: carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, carbonyls, indoor air quality, nitrogen \n\ndioxide, schools, volatile organic compounds.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 166 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n 167 \n\n5.1 Introduction \n\n \n\nIndoor air quality (IAQ) is often much worse than that of outdoor air (Pegas et al., \n\n2010; Kotzias et al., 2009). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in USA \n\nestimates that indoor air pollutant levels could be two to five times higher than pollution \n\nlevels outdoors. Evidence shows that citizens spend most of their time inside buildings, so \n\nit is easy to understand that they are, by far, more exposed to pollution indoors than \n\noutdoors (Blondeau et al., 2005; Sundell, 2004). Most chemical compounds to which \n\npeople are exposed everyday constitute an additional risk factor in the development of \n\nseveral pathologies (Sundell, 2004). In particular, exposure to indoor air pollution can \n\npotentially be a greater threat than exposure to outdoor air. Changes in construction \n\ndesigns and the increasing application of synthetic products could enhance the number of \n\ncomplaints about IAQ at several environments (home, workplaces, schools, transportation \n\nand others) (Yang et al., 2004). \n\nDaisey et al. (2003) performed a survey and a critical review of the existing \n\npublished reports on IAQ, ventilation, and building-related health symptoms in schools. \n\nThe type of health problems observed in schools was very similar to those defined as the \n\nsick building syndrome (SBS). Therefore, the IAQ and ventilation in school buildings may \n\naffect the children\u2019s health and indirectly influence learning performance and attendance.  \n\nThere are several reasons to consider IAQ at school a public concern. One is that \n\nchildren breathe higher volumes of air, relatively to their body weights. Children's \n\nphysiological vulnerability to air pollution arises from their narrower airways and the fact \n\nthat their lungs are still developing. Also, many children breathe through their mouths, \n\nbypassing the nasal passages\u2019 natural defences. Thus, children are more likely to suffer the \n\nconsequences of indoor pollution. Another reason for environmental deficiencies in \n\nschools is due to chronic shortages of funding, which contribute to inadequate operation \n\nand maintenance of facilities (Mendell and Heath, 2005). \n\nIn Lisbon, the number of children with asthma and rhinitis represents, respectively, \n\nabout 15% and 40% of the school-age population (Khan et al., 2007a). However, almost \n\n\n\n 168 \n\nnothing is known about IAQ in Portuguese schools. The main objectives of this work were: \n\n(a) to evaluate the contribution of ventilation, combustion processes, tobacco smoke and \n\ntraffic, to the bacterial and fungal levels and to the IAQ; (b) to assess their air quality by \n\ndetermining the concentrations of different indoor and outdoor pollutants (c) to compare \n\nthe measured concentrations with relevant standards (d) and to analyse the seasonal \n\nvariation of indoor and outdoor pollutant concentrations.  \n\n \n\n5.2 Material and Methods  \n\n \n\n5.2.1 Description of schools \n\n \n\nIndoor and outdoor air samples were collected at fourteen schools with a wide \n\ngeographical coverage representing the Lisbon urban area (Khan et al., 2007 a, b) (Figure \n\n5.1), in May and June 2009 (spring period), in November 2009 (autumn period), and in \n\nFebruary 2010 (winter period). Two classrooms from each of the fourteen schools were \n\nselected for this study. All classrooms depended only on the natural ventilation through the \n\nexisting doors and windows. Details of each sampling site are listed in Table 5.1. \n\n \n\n\n\n 169 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.1 - Distribution of the fourteen target schools in Lisbon.   \n \n\nTable 5.1 \u2013 Characteristics of classrooms in each school. \n\nSchool \nUrban \n\nenvironment \nElectric \nHeating \n\nBlackboard \nand chalk or \nwhiteboard \n\nwith pen \n\nNumber \nof \n\nstudents \nper room Floor \n\nAnimals \ninside \n\nPlants \ninside \n\nArea \n(m2) \n\nHeight \n(m) \n\nA suburban X blackboard 23 \nceramic \n\ntile   64.51 3.70 \n\nB city centre  whiteboard 24 \nceramic \n\ntile X X 46.82 3.50 \n\nC city centre X blackboard 22 \nceramic \n\ntile   50.14 3.50 \n\nD suburban  whiteboard 21 \nceramic \n\ntile   51.20 3.20 \n\nE suburban X blackboard 20 vinyl  X 46.95 3.15 \n\nF suburban X blackboard 19 \nceramic \n\ntile   62.68 3.40 \n\nG suburban X blackboard 22 \nceramic \n\ntile X  63.70 3.00 \n\nH city centre X blackboard 21 wood X X 50.08 3.2 \n\nI suburban X blackboard 23 \nceramic \n\ntile X  36.50 2.23 \n\nJ suburban X blackboard 22 wood   50.34 3.20 \nK city centre X blackboard 21 vinyl   48.36 3.80 \nL city centre X blackboard 21 vinyl   51.20 3.20 \nM city centre X blackboard 21 wood   49.77 3.70 \n\nN city centre X blackboard  21 \nceramic \n\ntile   X 46.68 2.64 \nNote: All classrooms were natural ventilated (windows and doors). \n\n\n\n 170 \n\n5.2.2 Comfort parameters and airborne microorganisms \n\n \n\nThree schools were previously considered representative of all the elementary-level \n\neducational institutions: the A, B and C schools (Khan et al., 2007a, b). At these three main \n\nschools, continuous measurements of temperature, relative humidity (RH), CO2, CO and \n\ntotal VOCs were performed with an automatic portable Indoor Air IQ-610 Quality Probe \n\n(Gray Wolf\u00ae monitor) in one classroom of each school, throughout a whole occupancy \n\nday, during the spring period. During the autumn and winter campaigns, these parameters \n\nwere monitored in parallel with sampling of microorganisms, in classrooms and \n\nplaygrounds. This IAQ monitor includes a Pt100 probe for measuring temperature, a \n\ncapacitance probe to sense RH, a CO2 non-dispersive infrared sensor and a CO \n\nelectrochemical sensor, all of them with an extremely fast response. The monitor also \n\nincludes a photo-ionisation detector to track total VOCs over time. It displays \n\nmeasurements in real time allowing logged data to be downloaded to Wolf Sense\u00ae PC \n\nsoftware for analysis. The equipment was supplied with a factory calibration certificate, \n\nbut it was further checked prior to its use, with appropriate calibration kits.  \n\nTaking into account that the National System for Energy and Indoor Air Quality \n\nCertification of Buildings (Regulamento dos Sistemas Energ\u00e9ticos de Climatiza\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nEdif\u00edcios \u2013 RSECE) (RSECE, 2006) restricts the bioaerosol measurements to bacterial and \n\nfungal colony-forming units per cubic metre of air (CFU m-3), only viable and culturable \n\nfungi and bacteria were quantified. Viable microorganism levels were monitored by liquid \n\nimpinger sampling (May and Harper, 1957) in the two classrooms and playgrounds, during \n\none day, in each one of the 3 main schools. The flow rate was set at 2.5 l min-1. Sampling \n\ntook one hour at each sampling place. Five replicates of 150 l of air from each classroom \n\nand playground were collected and analysed to confirm the validity of results. The Petri \n\ndishes were incubated for 5 and 7 days for bacterial and fungal, respectively, in dark boxes \n\nwith constant ambient temperature (25oC). \n\n \n\n5.2.3 Sampling and analysis of VOCs, carbonyls and NO2  \n\n \n\n\n\n 171 \n\nVOCs and carbonyls were sampled in parallel using Radiello\u00ae (Fondazione \n\nSalvatore Maugeri, Padova, Italy) diffusive passive tubes (cartridges codes 130 and 165, \n\nrespectively) for 14 consecutive days in two replicates. Indoor samples were collected at a \n\nheight of about 1.5 m above the floor. The diffusive samplers were positioned at a distance \n\nthat exceeded 1 m from a window or a door. Outdoor passive samples were collected at \n\nheights of about 2 m above the ground. The VOC adsorbing cartridges consisted of 60 mm \n\nlength stainless steel net cylinders, with 100 mesh grid opening and 5.8 mm diametre, \n\npacked with 530\u00b130 mg of activated charcoal with a particle size of 35-50 mesh (Cocheo \n\net al., 1996). \n\nVOCs were extracted from the exposed samplers with 2 ml carbon disulfide (CS2 \n\nfrom Aldrich) containing 2-fluorotoluene (from Aldrich) as an internal standard. The glass \n\nvials were shaken for approximately 30 min. The analyses of the extracts were performed \n\nby gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific Trace GC Ultra) coupled to a flame ionisation \n\ndetector (GC/FID), using nitrogen carrier gas at a constant pressure of 20 psi. A 100% \n\ndimethylpolysiloxane column (0.2 mm, 50 m, film thickness 0.5 \u00b5m) was used. The \n\ntemperature program was as follows: 50oC for 5 minutes, 5oC min-1 up to 80oC, 15oC min-1 \n\nup to 135oC, 20oC min-1 up to 220oC, final isotherm for 20 minutes. Injector and detector \n\ntemperatures were 240oC and 300oC, respectively. The equipment was calibrated before \n\nand during the sample analyses by injecting four standard solutions of all compounds \n\nidentified in CS2 (Pegas et al., 2010). The analytes in these four standard solutions were \n\npresent in concentrations of 40 ng \u00b5l-1, 20 ng \u00b5l-1, 10 ng \u00b5l-1 and 5 ng \u00b5l-1. Depending on \n\nthe analyte, the limit of detection (LOD= 3.3(s/S) where s is the STDEV of areas and S is \n\nthe slope) ranged from 0.34 to 2.52 ng \u00b5l-1 (Pegas et al., 2010). \n\nCarbonyls collected in cartridges filled with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reacted to \n\nresult in the corresponding 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones. These were extracted with 2 ml \n\nof acetonitrile (from Fisher Scientific). The glass vials were shaken for approximately 30 \n\nminutes and the extract filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m disc membrane filters (filtration kit RAD \n\n174) and injected into the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The \n\nanalytical system consisted of a Jasco PU- 980 pump, a Rheodyne manual injection valve \n\n(sample loop of 20 \u00b5 L), a Supelcosil LC-18 column (250\u00d74.6mm; 5\u00b5 m; Supelco) and a \n\nJasco MD-1510 diode array detector, all connected in series. Isocratic elution at room \n\n\n\n 172 \n\ntemperature was performed using an acetonitrile/water solution (60/40, v/v) as the mobile \n\nphase at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1. The carbonyl concentrations were quantified with \n\nexternal calibrations curves constructed from standard solutions of TO11/IP6A carbonyl \u2013 \n\nDNPH Mix (from Supelco) (U.S. EPA, 1999). The limit of detection (LOD) ranged from \n\n1.29 to 2.09 \u00b5g ml-1. \n\nNO2 concentrations were also passively monitored for fourteen days. The diffusive \n\nsamplers (70 mm length and 12 mm diameter polycarbonate tube) with steel grids \n\nimpregnated with triethanolamine chemiadsorb NO2, as nitrite, which was quantified by \n\nvisible spectrophotometry (Bhugwant and Hoareau, 2003). \n\nAlthough ozone is an important pollutant with health effects, its monitoring was not \n\ndone, because preliminary studies in several Portuguese indoor environments, including \n\nschools, showed that its levels were always below or close to the detection limit (Borrego \n\net al., 2007), except near photocopiers (Nunes et al., 2007).

The \n\nANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2004 (ASHRAE, 2004) recommends indoor temperature \n\nranges from 20 to 23\u00baC in the autumn/winter seasons and from 23 to 26\u00baC in the \n\nspring/summer seasons. The suggested indoor RH values are in the 30-60% range. Thermal \n\ncomfort is affected by heat, convection, human occupancy, radiation and evaporative heat \n\nloss. It is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is allowed to \n\ndissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings. Any heat gain or \n\nloss beyond this generates a sensation of discomfort (Hussein and Rahman, 2009). School \n\nchildren are susceptible to heat stress. At high temperatures, children are less able to \n\nconcentrate and can exhibit irritable or aggressive behaviours. Adults can be similarly \n\naffected. A decrease in temperature may also make people restless and less attentive. \n\nDuring the spring monitoring campaigns of this study, the thermal conditions in \n\nclassrooms were within the recommended ranges. However, during the winter period, \n\nclassrooms did not have conditions within the comfort zone. Thus, heating systems should \n\nbe implemented in these schools, namely by convection through panel heating or a \n\ncombination of radiation and convection. The recommended systems in schools are the \n\nHybrid Radiant Heating Systems or the Thermo Active Building Systems (Mumma, 2001). \n\nHigh relative humidity above 65% can lead to mould, mildew, and other biological growth. \n\nMould growth is linked to allergic reactions, asthma attacks, and hypersensitivity \n\npneumonitis (inflamed airways). The primary cause of high relative humidity levels is \n\nmoisture-laden outdoor air entering the buildings, especially during rainy winters, such as \n\nthe one registered in Lisbon. Desiccant based dedicated outdoor air systems are suggested \n\nas an effective way to operate school facilities in accordance with the ASHRAE Standards \n\n(Mumma, 2001). Considering that school-day peaks in humidity could still be problematic \n\nand provide sufficient moisture to condense on surfaces and provide wetting of surfaces, \n\nwhich could ultimately still support microbial growth, possible solutions could range from \n\ncontrolling the humidity with an energy efficient noiseless dehumidifier to overcoming \n\nbuilding pathologies (wall cracks, infiltrations, etc.). \n\nDuring the spring period, CO2 levels ranged widely (705 to 6821 mg m\n-3) (Figure \n\n5.2). The National System for Energy and Indoor Air Quality Certification of Buildings \n\n(Regulamento dos Sistemas Energ\u00e9ticos de Climatiza\u00e7\u00e3o de Edif\u00edcios - RSECE) establishes \n\n\n\n \n175 \n\nan acceptable maximum value (AMV) of 1800 mg m-3 for buildings in Portugal (RSECE, \n\n2006). Therefore, the CO2 average levels surpassed the acceptable threshold in the B and C \n\nschools for almost all the monitoring surveys, whereas the exceedances in the A school \n\nonly occurred in spring (Table 5.2). It is not easy to adequately characterise indoor CO2 \n\nconcentrations because they are a function of occupancy and ventilation rate, both varying \n\nas a function of time. Short-term measurements could be inadequate to provide information \n\non the long-term ventilation conditions in schools, but it may be very important to have \n\nmeasurements of different sampling places and to understand the influence of outdoor in \n\nindoor environment. High indoor CO2 levels are normally considered as indicative of \n\nventilation rates that are unacceptable with respect to body odours. Low concentrations of \n\nCO2 do not always guarantee that the ventilation rate is adequate for the removal of air \n\npollutants from indoor sources (Daisey et al., 2003). Normally, CO2 measurements in \n\nschools suggest that a significant number of classrooms do not meet the ANSI/ASHRAE \n\nStandard 62-2010 (ASHRAE, 2010) for minimum ventilation rates of 5 l s-1 per person. \n\nFigure 5.2 shows a strong correlation of the CO2 levels with occupancy: CO2 spikes were \n\neven more pronounced when students started physical activities inside the classrooms. CO2 \n\nconcentrations varied seasonally. In accordance with another study of British school \n\nclassrooms (Coley and Beisteiner, 2002), in Lisbon schools, higher CO2\n \nlevels in winter \n\nthan in spring were observed (Table 5.2). This indicates that during the spring period the \n\nwindows were more open, which explains the drop in CO2 levels. A broad literature review \n\nfor indoor environments generally suggests a consistent relationship between ventilations \n\nrates, high CO2 concentrations and health symptoms (Sepp\u00e4nen et al., 1999).\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n176 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.2 - Indoor carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide levels in the three main schools \nduring the spring season.  \n\n \n\nIn spring, CO ranged from non-detectable levels to 1.0 mg m-3 (Figure 5.2) and did \n\nnot reach 12.5 mg m-3, the recommended exposure limit (RSECE, 2006). During the \n\nautumn and the winter, the hourly average of CO was also below the exposure limit (Table \n\n5.2). CO is odourless and colourless, and it interferes with the distribution of oxygen in the \n\n\n\n \n177 \n\nbody (Chaloulakou et al., 2003). CO is one of the most characteristic traffic pollutants \n\nusually observed in urban areas. However, in this study, the average outdoor \n\nconcentrations of CO were lower than those indoors, for all seasons. Concomitant \n\nincreases of CO2 and CO concentrations, especially at the C school, were observed during \n\nspring daily measurements (Figure 5.2). CO is emitted when wood, coal and fossil fuels \n\nare burned incompletely. It is also emitted naturally when plants decay. In human breath, \n\nCO is detectable in small quantities in the exhaled air of healthy people (Zayasu et al., \n\n1997).  \n\nTotal VOC concentrations measured by the automatic monitor could provide \n\ninformation about the influence of indoor sources, such as aerosol sprays, solvents, \n\ncleaning agents, pesticides, paints, furniture and repellents. In a typical school-day in \n\nspring, the indoor average values ranged from 0.1 \u00b1 0.034 mg m-3 to 0.3 \u00b1 0.33 mg m-3 \n\n(Table 5.2) and did not exceed the recommended value of 0.6 mg m-3. (RSECE, 2006) \n\nHowever, in autumn, the indoor average hourly values ranged from 0.5 \u00b1 0.3 mg m-3 to 1.5 \n\n\u00b1 0.1 mg m-3. At the A school, part of the indoor VOCs may come from the outdoor \n\nenvironment, which presented 3.2 mg m-3. In the case of the B and C schools, additional \n\nindoor sources or inadequate ventilation ratios may have contributed to higher indoor \n\nlevels compared to outdoors. Examples of additional indoor sources could be glues and \n\npaints used by children in art classes. Pegas et al. (2010) and Zhang et al. (2006) also \n\nidentified an art classroom with a relatively high level of VOCs. Casey et al. (1995) \n\nreported total VOC measurements made in two elementary schools at Las Vegas, Nevada, \n\nduring the autumn/winter seasons. Before the installation and operation of heat recovery \n\nventilators (HRVs) in Las Vegas schools, the only means of ventilation was infiltration, \n\nand the total VOC levels ranged from 0.8 to 2.0 mg m-3. After the HRVs were operational, \n\nconcentrations of total VOC were reduced to 0.75 and 0.45 mg m-3 in the two classrooms. \n\nThus, a possible solution to decrease the total VOC concentrations in classrooms is the use \n\nof HRVs or other ventilation systems.  \n\nIn most schools, the total fungal and total bacterial colony-forming units in both \n\nindoor and outdoor air (Table 5.2) were above the AMV of 500 CFU m-3 defined by the \n\nPortuguese Legislation, Decree-Law 79/2006 (RSECE, 2006). Generally, the indoor \n\nculturable bacterial levels were higher than outdoor levels at all schools in any season. \n\n\n\n \n178 \n\nMost bioaerosols detected indoors have an outdoor source. They are introduced into the \n\nindoor environment through natural (open windows and doors) and mechanical ventilation \n\nsystems. They also are brought indoors on an individual\u2019s shoes and clothing (Gots et al., \n\n2003). High indoor bacteria counts were probably due to several factors, including high \n\nseasonal level of bioaerosols in outdoor air, indoor micro-climate with high temperatures, \n\nhuman activities, such as breathing, sweating and movement causing particle resuspension, \n\nhigh occupancy loading, poor hygienic condition of occupants, inadequate ventilation \n\nrates, movement of textiles, food products, etc (Lee et al., 2002; Mentese et al., 2009). \n\nMentese et al. (2009) evaluated bacteria and fungi levels in various indoor and outdoor \n\nenvironments in Ankara. The highest total bacteria counts were found in kindergartens, \n\nprimary schools, restaurants, high schools, and homes, while the highest mould levels were \n\nobserved in kitchens, bathrooms, and offices. In elementary schools of Lisbon, the lowest \n\nbacteria and fungi counts were generally found in winter. This seasonal variation in the \n\ncolony counts with maximum concentration in spring and a winter minimum were also \n\nobserved in previous studies (Medrela-Kuder, 2003). In winter, the low temperature and \n\nsmall amounts of fungal spores or bacteria in infiltrating outdoor air result in lower \n\nbioaerosol counts. The relationship between fungi and SBS symptoms in children has been \n\nreported (Cooley et al., 1998; Handal et al., 2004; Garret et al., 1998). The most effective \n\nway to manage bioaerosols in a building is to eliminate or limit the conditions that foster \n\ntheir establishment and growth. One of the methods is to prevent moisture due to \n\ncondensation by increasing surface temperature and/or reducing the moisture level in air \n\n(humidity). Also, efficient cleaning protocols could be implemented as a preventive action \n\nto control airborne microorganisms. \n\nGenerally, indoor total VOC concentrations were markedly higher than those \n\nobserved outdoors (Figure 5.3 and 5.4), except at the A school, in spring. This school had \n\nthe most spacious and well-ventilated classrooms and the lowest occupancy ratio. With the \n\ndrop in temperature in autumn and winter, the rooms remained longer with closed windows \n\nto maintain thermal comfort; this may have contributed to a gradual accumulation of \n\npollutants. Ventilation is defined by ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62-1999 (ASHRAE, 1999) \n\nin four steps: (1) entry of outside air, (2) conditioning, (3) mixture of air in the indoor \n\nenvironment, and (4) exhaustion of a portion of indoor air. If any of the four steps fails, \n\nventilation will be inadequate and a consequent accumulation of pollutants will occur. The \n\n\n\n \n179 \n\nhigh winter levels in the N school are probably related to the existence of toilets in front of \n\nthe classrooms, which were used by the cleaning staff to wash mops, buckets, etc, and as \n\nstorage room of cleaning products. During the spring/summer and autumn periods, the \n\ncleaning staff used outdoor installations for these activities. The indoor VOC accumulation \n\nis suspected to be one of the SBS causes (Daisey et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n180 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.3 - Indoor (2 classrooms) and outdoor VOC concentrations (sum of all \ncompounds identified) during spring, autumn and winter.  \n\n\n\n \n181 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.4 - Average concentrations (\u00b5g m-3) of all individual VOCs and carbonyls in all \nschools. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n182 \n\nThe groups of VOC and carbonyl compounds identified were as follows: aliphatic \n\nhydrocarbons (pentane, 2,2-dimethylbutane, 2-methylpentane, n-hexane, isooctane, n-\n\nheptane, octane, nonane, and n-decane); aldehydes and ketones (formaldehyde, acetone, 4-\n\nmethyl-2-pentanone, acetaldehyde, propynaldehyde, and benzaldehyde); ethers and \n\nalcohols (methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, 2-ethoxyethanol, methylcyclohexanol, \n\nand 1-propanol); aromatic hydrocarbons (benzene, ethylbenzene, m+p-xylene, styrene, o-\n\nxylene, and naphthalene); terpenes (?-pinene, (+)-sabinene, ?-pinene, (+)-3-carene, ?-\n\nterpinene, isoprene, limonene, and eucalyptol); esters (methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl \n\nacetate, and n-butyl acetate); halogenated hydrocarbons (dichloromethane, and 1,2-\n\ndichloropropane); and cyclo-aliphatics (cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane) (Figure \n\n5.4). VOC compounds showed a substantial seasonal variation (Figure 5.4). The sum of \n\nthe individual VOC concentrations in indoor air varied from 37 to 317 \u00b5g m-3 in spring, \n\nwhereas levels in autumn and winter ranged from 11 to 922 \u00b5g m-3 and from 84 to 2175 \u00b5g \n\nm-3, respectively. Highest concentrations occurred during the coldest months. This \n\nseasonal pattern is in accordance with the results of the AIRMEX study, which examined \n\nthe principal air contaminants present in public buildings in 11 European cities, including \n\nindoor environments frequented by children, like schools and kindergartens (Kotzias et al., \n\n2009). In our study, the sum of individual VOC concentrations in outdoor air were in the \n\nranges 6-80 \u00b5g m-3, 5-50 \u00b5g m-3 and 7-22 \u00b5g m-3 in spring, autumn and winter, \n\nrespectively. Thus, outdoor VOCs did not represent the major contribution to indoor levels. \n\nAll buildings contain a large variety of chemical sources, including synthetic carpet, \n\nconsumer products, paints, adhesives, furnishing, clothing, building materials, cleaning \n\nproducts, synthetic insulation, among others (Guo et al., 2004).  \n\nIndoor and outdoor benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) \n\nconcentrations are summarised in Table 5.3. BTEX are of particular interest due to their \n\nknown carcinogenic effects (Kotzias et al., 2009). For all BTEX compounds, in any \n\nseason, the indoor concentrations were generally higher than those measured outdoors. The \n\nmean benzene concentration was low at the majority of schools, ranging from values below \n\nthe detection limit to a maximum in winter of 2.89 \u00b5g m-3. For this pollutant, the indoor \n\nand outdoor levels do not differ appreciably. All measurements were below the limit value \n\nof 5 \u00b5g m-3 (annual mean) set by the European Commission. However, as it is a \n\ncarcinogenic compound, the WHO has not yet established a guideline or safe value (WHO, \n\n\n\n \n183 \n\n2000). At most sampling places, toluene, ethylbenzene, m+p-xylene and o-xylene were \n\nidentified in both indoor and outdoor samples, but with higher concentrations in the indoor \n\nenvironments. This may indicate additional indoor sources and/or accumulation of such \n\npollutants in the classrooms. Ethylbenzene and xylenes have been only detected in indoor \n\nenvironments during the coldest seasons at the H, J, L and M schools, suggesting a \n\nprobable indoor source. Toluene, xylenes and ethylbenzene could be originated from \n\nindoor sources, such as tobacco smoke, solvent-based paints, floor adhesives, PVC \n\nflooring, carpeting, printed material, and consumer products (Mendell, 2007). Toluene \n\nlevels were very similar to those found in schools of Curitiba, Brazil (Godoi et al., 2009). \n\nThe highest toluene concentrations detected in Lisbon are in the same range of those \n\nobserved in schools of Oporto, Portugal (Madureira et al., 2009). After a smoking ban was \n\nimposed in public places, in 2007, it was not expected to detect toluene from tobacco \n\nsmoke. However, Mulcahy et al.(2010) found that the levels of tobacco smoke exposure \n\nhave been reduced in workplaces after the ban, but have not been eliminated. The \n\ninfiltration from outdoors and the exhaled breath of smokers can contribute to pollutant \n\naccumulation indoors. \n\n\n\n \n184 \n\nNotes: - not identified; l. lost.  \n\nTable 5.3 - Overview of indoor and outdoor BTEX concentrations for fourteen schools in Lisbon during spring, autumn and winter. \nBTEX (\u00b5g m-3) BTEX (\u00b5g m-3) BTEX (\u00b5g m-3) \n\nSpring Autumn Winter \n\n Benzene Toluene Ethylbenzene \nm+p-\n\nXylene \no-\n\nXylene Benzene Toluene Ethylbenzene \nm+p-\n\nXylene o-Xylene Benzene Toluene Ethylbenzene \nm+p-\n\nXylene \no-\n\nXylene \nI 0.30 1.98 0.73 0.95 0.99 0.40 1.95 0.00 0.84 0.73 1.26 4.95 0.91 2.01 1.47 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.29 2.20 0.84 1.78 1.25 0.38 2.00 0.39 1.20 0.56 0.94 3.14 0.54 0.84 0.40 School A \n\nOutdoor   0.38 5.31 2.67 6.68 2.53 0.45 3.45 1.02 3.12 0.94 1.04 4.24 0.86 2.11 0.66 \nI 0.31 2.12 0.54 1.04 1.89 0.53 2.66 0.52 1.32 1.21 2.08 19.3 1.25 2.38 4.44 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.34 6.45 0.73 0.70 0.82 0.57 2.36 0.36 1.04 1.43 1.01 4.13 0.62 1.26 5.24 School B \n\nOutdoor   0.31 1.56 0.39 0.86 0.24 0.48 1.81 0.41 0.83 0.29 1.13 2.46 0.25 0.31 - \nI 0.34 2.14 1.66 3.54 4.96 0.63 3.80 1.85 3.63 3.47 1.15 4.11 1.07 2.10 5.71 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.33 1.96 1.39 3.04 3.45 0.49 2.91 1.82 4.18 5.01 1.05 4.76 1.05 1.72 3.35 School C \n\nOutdoor   0.37 1.74 0.57 1.4 0.47 0.48 1.94 0.38 1.10 0.41 1.18 2.75 0.51 0.53 0.13 \nI 0.36 2.83 1.11 1.86 0.55 0.45 2.85 0.60 1.26 1.04 0.99 7.43 0.92 2.07 1.06 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.28 1.99 0.33 0.87 0.34 0.39 3.32 0.44 1.06 0.99 1.26 3.09 0.58 0.73 0.58 School D \n\nOutdoor   0.29 1.24 0.34 0.77 0.23 0.45 1.53 0.35 0.81 0.28 0.96 1.84 0.26 0.30 - \nI 0.37 5.34 2.58 6.18 2.99 0.48 14.0 3.75 8.52 9.59 0.87 6.20 1.80 3.87 18.1 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.29 7.31 4.37 9.38 5.42 0.68 16.4 4.53 11.9 16.6 0.87 4.96 1.29 2.99 26.3 School E \n\nOutdoor  0.35 1.91 0.62 1.32 0.46 0.61 2.52 0.49 1.33 0.36 1.17 3.50 0.59 1.01 0.06 \nI 0.30 1.63 0.59 1.01 0.52 0.74 4.60 0.82 2.83 23.0 0.73 3.19 0.36 0.95 - \n\nIndoor \nII 0.22 1.45 0.5 0.92 0.56 0.70 3.70 0.67 2.32 - 0.94 2.36 0.71 0.88 22.2 School F \n\nOutdoor   0.29 1.41 0.44 0.89 - 0.55 1.87 0.33 0.83 0.24 1.19 2.51 0.23 0.31 - \nI 0.27 4.47 14.2 19.7 7.90 0.41 2.36 1.45 3.91 - 1.00 5.48 1.02 2.16 6.77 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.28 2.91 1.58 3.28 6.38 0.46 3.82 1.84 - 8.49 1.00 6.43 1.08 3.26 18.9 School G \n\nOutdoor   0.36 1.84 0.48 1.16 0.38 0.55 2.15 0.29 0.78 0.18 1.44 3.57 0.52 1.46 0.55 \nI 0.26 1.98 0.97 2.20 0.93 0.50 2.14 0.33 0.98 - 0.96 8.69 3.00 5.31 5.20 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.23 1.81 0.73 1.70 0.63 0.61 2.44 0.34 1.12 0.64 1.19 5.71 0.87 1.88 1.04 School H \n\nOutdoor   0.27 1.28 0.33 0.99 0.34 0.38 1.35 0.29 0.40 - 1.28 3.36 - - - \nI 0.41 5.55 2.60 5.35 5.06 0.78 4.35 2.63 7.60 3.80 0.96 5.20 37.7 109 40.3 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.41 3.21 1.17 2.39 3.60 0.72 3.98 1.84 5.87 4.04 0.94 5.75 54.4 160 110 School I \n\nOutdoor   0.26 1.79 0.48 1.14 0.35 0.47 2.22 0.60 1.84 0.59 1.19 3.14 0.77 1.73 0.69 \nI 0.29 1.72 0.60 0.94 2.00 0.31 2.17 0.42 0.64 0.40 0.91 2.70 0.54 0.56 - \n\nIndoor \nII 0.32 1.59 0.29 0.92 0.56 0.33 3.49 1.06 0.85 - 1.06 3.67 1.61 2.00 0.69 School J \n\nOutdoor   0.26 0.87 0.90 0.62 0.2 0.34 1.53 0.21 0.25 - 1.20 1.82 - - - \nI 0.32 3.13 1.18 2.65 0.79 0.51 14.09 0.44 1.25 0.55 1.91 10.0 1.46 2.09 4.57 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.49 2.61 13.97 40.0 9.71 0.68 23.30 1.78 4.26 3.26 2.89 17.8 2.31 5.11 7.38 School K \n\nOutdoor  0.45 5.74 0.43 1.17 0.37 l. l. l. l. l. 1.41 3.59 0.42 0.68 - \nI 0.28 1.42 0.58 1.33 7.18 0.38 1.52 0.32 0.51 0.35 1.04 2.54 0.86 1.50 4.71 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.31 5.50 0.48 1.15 2.40 0.39 1.54 0.36 0.42 0.55 1.08 4.03 0.46 0.70 1.88 School L \n\nOutdoor   0.33 1.42 0.64 1.00 0.27 0.41 1.51 - 0.33 - 1.42 2.19 - - - \nI 0.94 4.34 1.00 1.81 0.95 0.35 5.83 0.62 1.22 0.67 0.95 3.61 1.16 - - \n\nIndoor \nII 0.28 1.47 0.47 0.96 0.36 0.40 3.29 0.47 0.84 0.27 2.10 5.78 - 1.35 - School M \n\nOutdoor   0.22 1.35 0.31 0.97 0.27 0.44 1.53 0.25 0.47 0.19 1.26 2.10 - - - \nI 0.31 1.52 0.74 1.60 4.87 0.47 2.04 0.55 0.97 0.93 2.28 8.86 2.61 3.81 11.7 \n\nIndoor \nII 0.28 2.01 1.22 2.80 13.5 0.48 2.08 0.63 1.62 - 0.96 3.68 1.50 2.96 14.2 School N \n\nOutdoor   0.40 1.60 0.44 0.98 0.27 0.50 1.85 0.44 0.75 0.24 1.31 2.87 0.51 0.78 - \n\n\n\n \n185 \n\n \n\nIn winter, the highest indoor VOC concentrations were found in the F, G, I, K, M \n\nand N schools. A possible indoor source in the K school was vinyl flooring and floor \n\nadhesives, which are described as emitter materials, especially of benzene, toluene, \n\nxylenes, styrene, and ethylbenzene, among others (Mendell, 2007). For the other schools, \n\nsome old architectural finishes and consumers products could contribute for the \n\naccumulation of these VOC contaminations (Mendell, 2007). \n\nCarbonyl compounds are toxic and present carcinogenic health effects. They are the \n\nmost important chemical contaminants affected by chemical and physical processes in the \n\nenvironment (Cer\u00f3n et al., 2007). Carbonyls are emitted from incomplete combustion of \n\nbiomass and fossil fuel, and formed indirectly by atmospheric photo-oxidation of VOCs \n\n(Pang and Mu, 2006). In all studied places, the air concentrations for aldehydes inside the \n\nbuildings were higher than outside. Four carbonyls were identified in Lisbon schools: \n\nformaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propinaldehyde and benzaldehyde. Formaldehyde was by far \n\nthe most abundant carbonyl species. Indoor and outdoor concentrations of formaldehyde in \n\nspring, autumn and winter are shown in Figure 5.5. Unlike VOCs, in general, both indoor \n\nand outdoor formaldehyde concentrations in spring were higher than those in colder \n\nmonths. Formaldehyde could be evaporated under high temperature from building \n\nmaterials and furniture. Moreover, its photochemical production is more active in the \n\nhottest seasons, even in indoor environment (Pang and Mu, 2006). Indoor formaldehyde \n\nconcentrations ranged widely: 3.4-42.3 \u00b5g m-3 (spring), 3.1-26.2 \u00b5g m-3 (autumn), and 6.3-\n\n23.8 \u00b5g m-3 (winter). Therefore, the indoor concentration of formaldehyde was higher in \n\nspring than measured in autumn and winter. The same relationship between formaldehyde \n\nconcentrations and season has been reported in studies of residential microenvironments in \n\nChina (Wang et al., 2007). In 185 houses from Perth, Australia, Dingle and Franklin \n\n(2002) used a validated passive sampling technique and found that within homes there was \n\nno significant difference in formaldehyde concentrations measured among the rooms. \n\nHowever, according to the same study, it seems that formaldehyde concentrations are \n\nsignificantly affected by season and age of the buildings. The highest values were obtained \n\nin newer homes in summer (Dingle and Franklin, 2002). The levels of formaldehyde in \n\nKorean schools, most of which are housed in buildings from 1960s and 1970s, were \n\nmeasured and related to the age of the constructions by Sohn et al. (2007). Schools less \n\n\n\n \n186 \n\nthan one year old showed a higher average value of formaldehyde (0.16 ppm) than schools \n\nthat were 1-3 years old (0.12 ppm), 3-5 years old (0.07 ppm) and more than ten years old \n\n(0.07 ppm). In this study, school C possessed the oldest building. High levels of \n\nformaldehyde in other schools are likely associated with other sources and renovating \n\nactivities of old buildings. The highest level of formaldehyde was observed at school G. \n\nThe high levels may be related to the fact that this institution is located in the vicinity of \n\nmajor motorways with very intense traffic. It should be also noted that the ceilings of the \n\nschool G, H and J were painted during the Shrovetide period and new furniture was \n\npurchased just one month before the sampling campaign. There are many evidences \n\nindicating that children can be more sensitive to formaldehyde toxicity than adults. It is \n\nconsidered to be a chemical of concern at levels exceeding 1 \u00b5g m-3, a concentration more \n\nor less corresponding to background levels in rural areas (Kotzias et al., 2009). \n\n\n\n \n187 \n\n \n\nFigure 5.5 - Formaldehyde concentration in fourteen schools during spring, autumn and \n\nwinter. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n188 \n\nDescriptive data on indoor and outdoor concentrations of NO2 are given in Table \n\n5.4. The NO2 concentrations were always higher outdoors than indoors, probably as a \n\nresult of vehicular exhaust emissions from nearby traffic. Indoor NO2 average levels were \n\nwithin the intervals 15-37 \u00b5g m-3, 12-46 \u00b5g m-3, and 10-34 \u00b5g m-3 during the spring, \n\nautumn and winter, respectively. It should be remembered, however, that these data were \n\nobtained by passive sampling, representing average concentrations of several days. \n\nTherefore, they do not show possible peaks, which may contribute to harmful effects \n\nthrough exposure over short periods of time. The same recommendation could be assigned \n\nfor carbonyls and VOC compounds. In general, the I/O NO2 ratios ranged between 0.35 \n\nand 1, never exceeding the unity. Because NO2 is reactive, its removal from the indoor \n\nenvironment may occur not only by dilution, convection or gaseous diffusion processes, \n\nbut also by gas phase mechanisms and reactions on the inner surfaces of materials (e.g. \n\nfurniture) (Ugucione et al., 2009). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n189 \n\nTable 5.4 - Indoor and outdoor NO2 concentrations in fourteen schools in \nLisbon during spring, autumn and winter. \n\n NO2 atm concentration (\u00b5g m\n-3) \n\n Spring Auntumn Winter \n\n  Indoor Outdoor I/O  Indoor Outdoor I/O  Indoor Outdoor I/O  \n\nSchool A 31.0 36.5 0.85 31.1 34.7 0.90 34.4 34.4 1.00 \n\nSchool B 35.2 37.2 0.95 35.1 38.3 0.92 33.6 40.5 0.83 \n\nSchool C 32.6 45.9 0.71 34.1 41.2 0.83 29.4 41.3 0.71 \n\nSchool D 33.3 39.4 0.85 31.5 34.7 0.91 30.3 34.3 0.88 \n\nSchool E 14.9 41.6 0.36 12.4 35.2 0.35 24.0 35.2 0.68 \n\nSchool F 33.5 35.7 0.94 45.8 46.6 0.98 23.4 32.7 0.71 \n\nSchool G 21.7 42.4 0.51 21.4 39.0 0.55 15.9 36.2 0.44 \n\nSchool H 34.0 37.5 0.91 35.5 36.3 0.98 18.6 38.0 0.49 \n\nSchool I 37.4 41.5 0.90 35.1 41.9 0.84 17.3 34.1 0.51 \n\nSchool J 20.2 25.1 0.81 22.9 34.9 0.65 10.2 22.8 0.45 \n\nSchool K 29.6 45.7 0.65 32.2 50.0 0.64 18.5 30.1 0.61 \n\nSchool L 32.2 39.1 0.82 39.6 46.2 0.86 18.9 22.9 0.82 \n\nSchool M 35.5 39.1 0.91 36.6 36.9 0.99 16.3 25.3 0.65 \n\nSchool N 30.7 35.9 0.85 40.7 50.1 0.81 21.0 27.5 0.76 \n\n \n\nThe International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) written \n\nquestionnaire was applied to the same school population of this study. Information on \n\nasthma and rhinitis prevalence, as well the risk factors related to these respiratory diseases, \n\ncan be found in Pegas et al. (2011). A statistically significant increase in the prevalence of \n\nrhinitis and wheeze was observed among primary schoolchildren in Lisbon (Pegas et al., \n\n2011). Children spend more time in schools than in any other place, except at home. \n\nHaving pets at home was suggested as a significant risk factor for rhinitis, but not smoking \n\nexposure, mould, plush toys, diet (except egg consumption), breastfeeding or other house \n\nconditions (Pegas et al., 2011).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n190 \n\n5.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nIndoor and outdoor comfort parameters and microbiological counts were monitored \n\nin three main elementary schools, while indoor and outdoor concentrations of NO2, VOCs \n\nand carbonyls were measured, for the first time, in fourteen elementary schools in Lisbon, \n\nduring May and June 2009 (spring period), November 2009 (autumn period), and February \n\n2010 (winter period). The CO2 concentrations and the bioaerosol counts greatly exceeded \n\nthe AMV of 1800 mg m-3 and 500 CFU m-3, respectively, in all three seasons. The daily \n\nprofiles of CO2 suggest that the classrooms are inadequately ventilated. The high amounts \n\nof bioaerosols in both indoor and outdoor environments may derive from several factors, \n\nincluding human activities. Most of the assessed VOCs and carbonyls occurred at I/O \n\nratios above unity, in all seasons, showing the important influence of indoor sources and \n\nbuilding conditions in IAQ. However, it has been observed that higher indoor VOC \n\nconcentrations occur often in the colder months, while carbonyl concentrations were higher \n\nin warm months. Schools located near traffic busy streets presented the highest outdoor \n\nand the smallest indoor NO2 levels, possibly because the windows and the doors were \n\nalways closed, or because NO2 indoor concentrations decayed by gas-phase processes or \n\nby reactions on the inner surfaces of furniture. \n\nSome improvements should be made to reduce the risks of exposure, such as the \n\ndevelopment of low-VOC-emission materials and consumer products indoors, the decrease \n\nof the number of students in each classroom, the usage of air cleaners in indoor \n\nenvironments, and humidity control. Increasing the ventilation rate by means of \n\nmechanical or natural systems can play a key role in improving the indoor air quality. \n\nAdditional studies are needed to determine the extent of IAQ problems in schools. \n\nIt would be important to use active samplers in future studies to obtain both daily and \n\nmonthly profiles aiming at evaluating additional indoor sources and the short-term \n\nexposure to pollution peaks. More studies are also necessary focusing on the monitoring of \n\nthe relations between symptoms and measured exposures to multiple specific pollutants. \n\nFurthermore, quantitative information is required on exposure-health response \n\nrelationships for specific pollutants suspected of causing health problems, in order to \n\n\n\n \n191 \n\nafford a sound basis for establishing standards for schools and for assuring cost effective \n\nmitigation actions. \n\n \n\n5.5 References \n\n \n\nASHRAE, 1999.

INDOOR AND OUTDOOR CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC \nAND INORGANIC COMPOUNDS IN CITY CENTRE AND \nSUBURBAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OF AVEIRO, PORTUGAL \n \n\nPublished \n\nPegas, P.N., Nunes, T. Alves, C.A., Silva, J.R., Vieira, S.L.A., Caseiro, A., Pio, C.A., \n\n2012. Indoor and outdoor characterisation of organic and inorganic compounds in city \n\ncentre and suburban elementary schools of Aveiro, Portugal. Atmospheric Environment \n\n55, 80-89. \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nPollutants inside school buildings may affect children\u2019s health and influence learning \n\nperformance and attendance. This study investigated pollutant concentrations inside and \n\noutside school buildings at different locations (city centre and suburban) in Aveiro, \n\nPortugal, between April and June 2010. The aim was to evaluate simultaneously comfort \n\nparameters (temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and CO) and indoor and outdoor \n\nconcentrations of VOCs, NO2, PM10 and bioaerosols. PM10 samples were analysed and \n\ncharacterised, for the first time, for the water soluble inorganic ions (WSII), organic carbon \n\n(OC), elemental carbon (EC), carbonates, and detailed organic speciation. The CO2 and \n\nbioaerosol levels were higher than the acceptable maximum values to the occupants\u2019 \n\ncomfort. Concentrations of the traffic tracer NO2 were higher outdoors. The daily indoor \n\nPM10 levels were always higher than those outdoors, except on weekends, suggesting that \n\nthe physical activity of pupils and class works highly contributed to the emission and \n\nresuspension of particles. Almost all identified VOCs showed I/O ratios higher than one, \n\nwhich denotes an important contribution from indoor sources at both schools. The \n\nsuburban school was more exposed to industrial emissions than the institution located in \n\nthe city centre. Especially at the city centre, infiltration of outdoor particulates leads to \n\ncontamination of school indoor environment with vehicle emissions and biomass burning \n\nsmoke likely coming from biofuel use in nearby restaurants and bakeries. \n\nKey words: indoor air school, particulate matter, inorganic pollutants, organic pollutants. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n202 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n203 \n\n6.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nIt has been shown that indoor air quality (IAQ) is usually worse than the outdoors air \n\n(Godoi et al., 2009; Jo and Seo, 2005; Kotzias et al., 2009; Lee and Chang, 2000; Pegas et \n\nal., 2010; Pegas et al., 2011a,b; Yang et al., 2009). People are exposed to a multitude of \n\nchemical and biological stressors, some of which cause health problems (allergy, asthma, \n\nsensory irritation, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, lung cancer, etc.) (Bernstein et al., 2008; \n\nJie et al., 2009; Rios et al.; 2009; Samet and Spengler, 2003). On the other hand, some \n\nindoor air pollutants, such as dust and water vapour, accumulate on equipments, increasing \n\nthe chance of an electrical breakdown (Lohbeck, 2008). Results of many studies \n\ndemonstrate a significant and causal correlation between improving the indoor \n\nenvironment and gains in productivity and health (Fisk, 2000; Fisk and Rosenfeld, 1997; \n\nKats et al., 2003; Kumar and Fisk., 2002; Mendell and Heath, 2005; Mudarri and Fisk, \n\n2007; Seppanen et al., 2007). \n\nChildren, as result of the immaturity of immunity system and of growing processes, are \n\nmore fragile and susceptible to indoor pollution effects (Mendell and Heath, 2005). \n\nChildren in scholar age spend an important fraction of their time indoors in schools. In \n\nPortugal school buildings are frequently old and degraded, potentiating negative health \n\neffects in their young occupants. \n\nAs result of predictable impact of school IAQ in children health several studies have \n\nbeen performed worldwide in this topic (Daisey et al., 2003; Mendell and Heath, 2005). \n\nThe pollutants most commonly measured in elementary school studies are gaseous \n\ncompounds, which comprise total or speciated volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde \n\nand nitrogen dioxide, as well as biological agents including airborne fungi and bacteria \n\n(e.g. Blondeau et al., 2004; Godoi et al., 2009; Jo and Seo, 2005; Lee and Chang, 2000; \n\nMeklin et al., 2002; Pegas et al., 2011a,b; Yang et al., 2009). Comparatively to these \n\ntraditional pollutants, indoor concentrations of particles at schools have been sparsely \n\ninvestigated. In spite of the various studies performed worldwide to assess the pupils\u2019 \n\nexposure to indoor particles, only a few aimed at characterising their chemical \n\ncomposition, and this was mainly focused on the elemental content (e.g. Almeida et al., \n\n2011; Moln\u00e1r et al., 2007; Oeder, et al., 2012; Stranger et al., 2008). Nevertheless, \n\n\n\n \n204 \n\npractically nothing is known about the organic speciation and the respective sources of \n\nparticles in the indoor air of schools. Due to their carcinogenic potential, only polycyclic \n\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the indoor air of residences, offices or commercial \n\nspaces have been characterised in a number of studies (Chalbot et al., 2006; Johannesson et \n\nal., 2009; Jung et al., 2010; Naumova et al., 2002, 2003; Ohura et al., 2004).  \n\nIn the present study, in addition to traditional measurements, a detailed chemical \n\ncharacterisation of particles occurring in both indoor and outdoor environments of \n\nelementary schools was performed. As far as we know, the abundances of several classes \n\nof organic compounds in airborne particles in schools were obtained for the first time. \n\nSuch information is important as it appends to the emergent global-wide dataset of IAQ in \n\neducational buildings.  \n\n \n\n6.2. Material and Methods \n\n \n\n6.2.1. Study design \n\n \n\n \n\nThis study investigated, for the first time, pollutant concentrations inside and outside \n\nschool buildings at different locations in Aveiro, Portugal. Comfort parameters \n\n(temperature, CO2 and CO), microorganisms, NO2, VOCs and PM10 concentrations in two \n\nelementary schools (city centre and suburban location) were measured between April and \n\nJune 2010.  \n\nAveiro is a coastal city with approximately 60,000 inhabitants. It is situated on the \n\nshores of a coastal lagoon. An industrial complex is located 10 km to the north of the city. \n\nThe city centre school is located at 40\u00ba 38\u2019 16.76\u2019\u2019N; 8\u00ba 39\u2019 09.85\u2019\u2019W. This school started \n\nits activities in the sixties. It is surrounded by commercial and residential buildings and in \n\nfront of the school there is a car parking and busy road. The main classroom studied has \n\nwood floor, water based paint covering the walls, blackboard and chalk, white board and \n\nmarkers and wood windows. The suburban school is located at 40\u00ba 39\u2019 0.09\u2019\u2019N; 8\u00ba 38\u2019 \n\n25.06\u2019\u2019W. This school started its activities in 2000/2001. The school is located on the \n\n\n\n \n205 \n\noutskirts of the city in a rural area with a mixture of cultivated and abandoned farm fields. \n\nSome automobile paint and repair shops are located about 100 m west of the school. A \n\nperipheral motorway, at a lower altitude level, is approximately 500 m far. Residential \n\nneighbourhoods are found to the east. The main classroom studied presents similar \n\ncharacteristics to those already described for the other school. The main difference is the \n\naluminium windows. Both school buildings are naturally ventilated. \n\n \n\n6.2.2. Sample collection and analytical methods \n\n \n\nContinuous measurements of temperature, relative humidity (RH), CO2 and CO were \n\nperformed with an automatic portable Indoor Air IQ-610 Quality Probe (Gray Wolf\u00ae \n\nmonitor) in one classroom of each school, throughout two weeks. The equipment was \n\nsupplied with a factory calibration certificate, but it was further checked prior to its use, \n\nwith appropriate calibration kits.  \n\nTaking into account that the National System for Energy and Indoor Air Quality \n\nCertification of Buildings (DL 79/2006, Regulamento dos Sistemas Energ\u00e9ticos de \n\nClimatiza\u00e7\u00e3o de Edif\u00edcios \u2013 RSECE) restricts the bioaerosol measurements to bacterial and \n\nfungal colony-forming units per cubic metre of air (CFU m-3), only viable and culturable \n\nfungi and bacteria were quantified. Viable microorganism levels were monitored by liquid \n\nimpinger sampling (May and Harper, 1957) in the classrooms and playgrounds, during one \n\nday in each school. The flow rate was set at 2.5 L min-1. Sampling took one hour at each \n\nsampling place. Five replicates of 150 L of air from each classroom and playground were \n\ncollected and analysed to confirm the validity of results. The Petri dishes were incubated \n\nfor 5 and 7 days for bacterial and fungal, respectively, in dark boxes with constant ambient \n\ntemperature (25oC). \n\nNO2 concentrations were passively monitored during one week-period, for two weeks, \n\nin four classrooms and playgrounds of each school. The diffusive samplers with steel grids \n\nimpregnated with triethanolamine chemiadsorb NO2, as nitrite, which was quantified by \n\nvisible spectrophotometry (Bhugwant and Hoareau, 2003). \n\n\n\n \n206 \n\nRadiello\u00ae passive samplers were used for VOC monitoring in the classrooms and at \n\nthe playgrounds, during two weeks. VOCs were extracted from the exposed samplers with \n\n2 mL carbon disulfide (CS2 from Aldrich) containing 2-fluorotoluene (from Aldrich) as an \n\ninternal standard. The glass vials were shaken for approximately 30 min. The analyses of \n\nthe extracts were performed by gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific Trace GC Ultra) \n\ncoupled to a flame ionisation detector. More details of the method can be found in Pegas et \n\nal. (2010).  \n\nIn each school, on working days, daily sampling of PM10 was performed, \n\nsimultaneously in one classroom and outdoors. Both indoors and outdoors, two parallel \n\nsamples were obtained by using 4 low volume samplers. On the weekends, a 48-hour \n\nsampling time was adopted. The PM samples were collected onto pre-baked (6 h at 500\u00baC) \n\nquartz filters 47 mm in diameter. The particulate matter sampling programme was carried \n\nout over a 2 week-period in both schools. PM10 mass concentrations were quantified \n\nfollowing the EN 12341 method. After mass weight, the PM10 filters were stored in a \n\nfreezer until chemical analysis. One of the parallel PM10 filters was used for the WSII \n\ndetermination, while the respective pair was devoted to the organic speciation, after \n\ncarbonate and OC/EC analysis.  \n\nFor the determination of water soluble inorganic ions, small parts of the filters were \n\nextracted with ultra pure Milli-Q water. Dionex AS14 and CS12 chromatographic columns \n\nwith Dionex AG14 and CG12 guard columns coupled to Dionex AMMS II and Dionex \n\nCMMS III suppressors, respectively for anions and cations, have been used.  \n\nThe carbon fractions, EC and OC, were analysed by a home-made thermo-optical \n\ntransmission system described in detail elsewhere (Alves et al., 2011). Carbonates present \n\nin PM10 samples were analysed through the release of CO2, and measurement by the same \n\nnon-dispersive infrared analyser coupled to the thermo-optical system, when a punch of \n\neach filter was acidified with orthophosphoric acid (20%) in a free CO2 gas stream.  \n\nTwo to three filters sampled during the same day of the week for the same local were \n\ncombined to meet the limits of detection from speciated organic compounds. Thus, an \n\n\u201caverage\u201d organic composition for each day of the week was obtained. The combined \n\nfilters were extracted together by refluxing 300 mL of dichloromethane (Fisher Scientific) \n\n\n\n \n207 \n\nfor 24 h to obtain non-polar and semi-polar, and, to a lesser extent, polar compounds. \n\nTaking into account that the extraction efficiency of dichoromethane for polar compounds \n\nis around 75% (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011a), after filtration, the pieces of filter were extracted \n\n3 times with methanol (Fisher Scientific) (75 mL for 10 min, each extraction) in an \n\nultrasonic bath to guarantee a 100% recovery of polar compounds. All the 4 extracts were \n\nthen combined, vacuum concentrated and dried under a gentle nitrogen stream. The total \n\norganic extracts were subsequently separated into five different organic fractions by flash \n\nchromatography with silica gel (230\u2013400 mesh, 60 \u00c5 Merck Grade 9385) and various \n\nsolvents of increasing polarity. Following each elution, the different fractions were vacuum \n\nconcentrated and evaporated under an ultra pure nitrogen stream. Before injection, the \n\nfractionated extracts that included more polar compounds were derivatised to trimethylsilyl \n\nethers. Finally, the extracts were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry \n\n(GC\u2013MS). The GC\u2013MS system was accurately calibrated using about 150 high purity \n\nindividual compounds at four/five different concentration levels. All samples and authentic \n\nstandards were injected with two internal standards: tetracosane-d50 (Sigma-Aldrich) and \n\n1-chlorohexadecane (Merck). Additionally, the EPA 8270 semi-volatile internal standard \n\nmix (Supelco), containing six deuterated compounds (1,4-dichlorobenzene-d4, \n\nnaphthalene-d8, acenaphthene-d10, phenanthreme-d10, chrysene-d12, perylene-d12), has \n\nbeen used for PAH analysis. The methodology for the extraction, flash chromatography \n\nand GC\u2013MS analysis was previously described in detail by Alves et al. (2011). \n\nThe normality was checked for all variables by Q-Q plots and by Shapiro-Wilk tests \n\n(Brown and Hambley, 2002). When deviations from normality were observed, then the \n\nnon-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was preferred rather than the Student\u2019s t-test to \n\nevaluate the significance of differences between variables (Brown and Hambley, 2002). A \n\ndifference between two means was considered to be statistically significant when the p-\n\nvalue of the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was lower than 0.05. All statistical \n\ncomputations were conducted with the R software (http://www.r-project.org/).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n208 \n\n6.3. Results and discussion \n\n \n\n6.3.1. Comfort parameters, gaseous pollutants and microorganisms  \n\n \n\nThe indoor average temperatures during the occupation periods were very similar in \n\nboth schools: 23 \u00b1 0.6oC (city centre school) and 23 \u00b1 0.5oC (suburban school). The \n\naverage values obtained for the relative humidity were 57 \u00b1 2% and 46 \u00b1 3%, respectively, \n\nfor the city centre and suburban schools. In addition to meteorological specificities during \n\nthe sampling campaigns in each school, this small difference may be related to the better \n\ninsulation of the more recent building that composes the suburban institution. The \n\nANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-2004 specifies the temperature and humidity ranges that are \n\ncomfortable for 80% of people engaged in chiefly sedentary activities. The operative \n\ntemperature acceptable ranges are 20\u201323\u00baC in winter and 23\u201326\u00baC in summer. Acceptable \n\nRH levels should range from 30 to 60%. The \u201ccomfort zone\u201d limits the growth of \n\nmicroorganisms. \n\nCarbon dioxide is commonly measured as a screening tool to evaluate if adequate \n\nvolumes of fresh outdoor air are being introduced into indoor air. The National System for \n\nEnergy and Indoor Air Quality Certification of Buildings establishes an acceptable \n\nmaximum value (AMV) of 1800 mg m-3 for buildings in Portugal (RSECE, 2006). Figure \n\n6.1 depicts the variation of indoor CO2 concentrations in a typical working day at both \n\nschools. A strong correlation of the CO2 level with occupancy has been observed. During \n\nthe occupation period, in the city centre school, the CO2 levels ranged widely from 899 to \n\n2540 mg m-3, while in the suburban school, values were between 833 and 1859 mg m-3. \n\nHigh indoor CO2 levels are normally considered as indicative of inadequate ventilation. \n\nOutdoor \"fresh\" air ventilation is important because it can dilute contaminants that are \n\nproduced in the indoor environment, such as odours released from people and pollutants \n\nemitted from the buildings, equipments, furnishings, and human activities. Adequate \n\nventilation can limit the build up of these pollutants. It is these other contaminants and not \n\nusually CO2 that may lead to IAQ problems and complaints.  \n\n\n\n \n209 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.1. Classroom CO2 concentration (mg m\n-3) during a typical occupation period. \n\n \n\nThe total bacterial colony-forming units in both indoor and outdoor air (Figure 6.2) \n\nwere above the AMV of 500 CFU m-3 defined by the Portuguese Legislation, Decree-Law \n\n79/2006 (RSECE, 2006). These high CFU values are in agreement with measurements \n\ncarried out in Lisbon elementary schools in spring, where indoor bacterial levels were also \n\nhigher than outdoor levels at all institutions, regardless of season (Pegas et al., 2011a). The \n\nelevated levels of indoor bacteria have been primarily attributed to the number of \n\noccupants. Increased human shedding of skin cells, ejection of microorganisms and \n\nparticulates from the respiratory tract, and the transport of bacteria on suspended dust \n\nparticles from floor surfaces probably account for the strong positive correlation between \n\noccupancy levels and the concentration of bacteria in internal air (Goh et al., 2000; \n\nMoschandreas et al., 2003). High bacterial levels are also associated with excess moisture \n\nin indoor environments, especially in damaged buildings (Meklin et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n210 \n\n \n\nFigure 6.2. Indoor and outdoor bioaerosol levels in both city centre and suburban schools.  \n\n \n\nComparable NO2 concentrations were obtained in both schools. Levels were below the \n\nannual and hourly limit values (lower thresholds) of 26 \u00b5g m-3 and 100 \u00b5g m-3, \n\nrespectively, for the protection of human health, stipulated by the Air Quality Directive \n\n2008/50/EC. The I/O average NO2 ratio was 0.70 \u00b1 0.06 in the city centre school, and 0.48 \n\n\u00b1 0.23 in the suburban school. NO2 concentrations were higher outdoors than indoors \n\n(Table 6.1), probably as a result of vehicular exhaust emissions from nearby traffic.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n211 \n\nTable 6.1. NO2 concentration in city centre and suburban schools. \n\n \n\n \n\nIn general, concentrations of VOCs were higher indoors than outdoors for both schools \n\n(Table 6.2). The outdoor sum of identified VOCs was significantly lower (about 10 \u00b5g m-\n\n3) for both schools. Higher indoor levels of many VOC species were also registered in \n\nprevious studies involving 14 elementary schools of the Portuguese capital, Lisbon (Pegas \n\net al., 2010, 2011a,b). In the present study, the very high dichloromethane concentrations \n\nin the indoor air of both schools deserve consideration. In a Canadian household study \n\ncarried out by Zhu et al. (2005), very high dichloromethane indoor levels, up to 400 \u00b5g m-\n\n3, were also measured. The National Occupational Health and Safety Commission \n\n(NOHSC) established an eight-hour time weighted average exposure limit in the workplace \n\nof 174 mg m-\u00b3. Household products containing dichloromethane could possibly be the main \n\nsources of dichloromethane in indoor air. Dichloromethane is found in adhesives, spray \n\npaints, automotive cleaners, and varnish removers Among the consumer products that may \n\ncontain dichloromethane are aerosol propellants, aerosol air fresheners and deodorants, \n\nfurniture polish and cleaners, hairsprays, household hard surface cleaners (aerosol and \n\nliquid), household insecticides, household tints and dyes, shoe polish and cleaners, etc.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n212 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.2. VOC concentrations (\u00b5g m-3). \n\n \n\n \n\n6.3.2. Particles and their carbonaceous and ionic contents \n\n \n\nIt has been observed that the 24-hour PM10 values frequently exceed the lower \n\nthreshold of 25 \u00b5g m-3 stipulated by the European Directive for outdoor air (Table 6.3). \n\nYet, concentrations did not exceed the limit value of 150 \u00b5g m-3 established by the \n\nPortuguese legislation for indoor air (RSECE, 2006). However, it should be taken into \n\naccount that, in this study, a 24-hour sampling schedule was followed, while classes are \n\n\n\n \n213 \n\nonly held 8 hours a day (9:00 to 18:00). Thus, measurements may have underestimated the \n\nstudents\u2019 exposure to PM10, as it can be seen from Table 6.4, where rough estimations of \n\nPM10 concentrations during school hours are presented. The estimation of the PM10 \n\nconcentrations for the occupation period was derived from the following mass balance: \n\n \n\n( ) ( )\n24\n\n)16(\n\n10\n\n)8(\n\n10)24(\n10\n\nhccupiedOutdoorUnohpationIndoorOccu\nhIndoor PMPMPM\n\n+\n=                                           (6.1) \n\n \n\n \n\nYip et al. (2004), in an investigation conducted in Detroit elementary schools and \n\nhomes, observed a 2-fold increase in indoor PM10 concentrations after changing the \n\nsampling time from 24 to 8 hours. The daily indoor PM10 levels were always higher than \n\nthose outdoors, except on weekends (Table 6.3 and 6.4), suggesting that the physical \n\nactivity of the pupils leads to resuspension of coarse particles and greatly contributes to \n\nenhance PM10 in classrooms (Almeida et al., 2011). The estimated PM10 concentrations for \n\nthe occupation periods suggest that the high levels are due to class activities, either by \n\nresuspension or by the introduction/production of new particulate matter (soil material \n\nbrought in shoes, blackboard dust, skin flakes, cloth and furniture fragments, viable moulds \n\nand bacteria, and insects, for example) (Table 6.4). Whilst the results indicated an \n\nimportant background contribution to indoor PM10 from penetration of outdoor particles, \n\nthese indoor sources contributed substantially to indoor concentrations and were the \n\ndominant apportioners. In statistical terms, the indoor PM10 concentrations of the city \n\ncentre school were significantly higher than those outdoors (p-values of 0.0007944), while \n\nno significant difference was observed between the indoor and outdoor levels of the \n\nsuburban school (p-value of 0.1064). On the other hand, it was observed that the outdoor \n\nPM10 levels of the suburban school were significantly higher than the outdoor values of the \n\ncity centre school (p-value of 0.004205).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n214 \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 6.3.

Indoor and outdoor PM10 concentration during all day long (24h) and estimated \nindoor occupation (8h). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOur results are in line with findings of previous studies carried out in elementary \n\nschools in different regions of the world (Almeida et al., 2011; Blondeau et al., 2004; \n\nDiapouli et al., 2008; Fromme et al., 2008; Halek et al., 2009; Oeder et al.,2012; Stranger \n\net al., 2008). It has been shown that fine particulate matter is the size fraction most strongly \n\nassociated with morbidity, but some studies have demonstrated that PM10 may also have \n\nnegative effects on children\u2019s health (Schwartz and Neas, 2000; Smith et al., 2000; \n\nWeinmayr et al., 2010).  \n\nTaking into account that the main component of chalk used in both schools is calcium \n\ncarbonate (CaCO3) and not calcium sulphate (CaSO4), and thus assuming there is no \n\nindoor source of sulphate, the indoor-generated PM10 can be calculated by the infiltration \n\nratio for sulphate (Fromme et al., 2008), as follows: \n\n \n\nosulph\no\n\nsulph\ni\n\nsulph\n\nPM\n\niig C\nC\n\nC\nCC \u00d7\u00d7?=\n\n?\n?\n\n                                                                                                                                        (6.2) \n\n\n\n \n216 \n\n \n\nwhere Cig is the sum of indoor-generated PM10, Ci is the total indoor PM10 concentration, \n\n?\nPM/?sulph is the ratio between the increase of indoor PM10 per outdoor PM10 (linear \n\nrelationship) and the increase of indoor sulphate per outdoor sulphate (linear relationship), \n\nCi\nsulph is the indoor sulphate concentration, Co\n\nsulph is the outdoor sulphate concentration, \n\nand Co is the outdoor PM10 concentration (Fromme et al., 2008).  \n\nApplying the measured values, it has been observed that 74 \u00b1 23% of the total PM10 in \n\nthe city centre school was generated indoors rather than being carried inside from outdoors, \n\nwhile highly variable contributions were obtained for the suburban school.  \n\nGenerally, the concentration of particulate water soluble inorganic ions (Table 6.3) \n\nwas higher outdoors (30% and 32% of the PM10 mass at the city centre school and at the \n\nsuburban school, respectively) than indoors (13% and 18% of the PM10 mass at the city \n\ncentre and at the suburban school, respectively), suggesting that the main sources of \n\ninorganic material are external. Indoor sulphate was the dominant water soluble ion, \n\nrepresenting 22% and 30% of the total concentrations of all analysed ions, in the city \n\ncentre and suburban schools, respectively. The indoor sulphate levels in the suburban \n\nschool were significantly higher than the indoor levels in the city centre school (p-value of \n\n0.000981). The outdoor sulphate levels at the suburban school were found to be \n\nsignificantly higher than those observed at the city centre institution (p-value of 0.02751). \n\nThe chloride levels in the downtown school accounted for 12% and 13% of the total ionic \n\nconcentrations in the indoor and outdoor air, respectively. In the suburban school, the \n\nchloride levels represented 10% (indoors) and 17% (outdoors) of the total ionic mass \n\nconcentrations. The outdoor chloride levels of the suburban school were significantly \n\nhigher than the indoor levels at the city centre school (p-value of 0.005109). As observed \n\nin other coastal towns, such as Salina Cruz, Mexico (Baumgardner et al., 2006), the \n\namounts of chloride ion likely have a strong contribution from sea spray. The school \n\nsituated on the outskirts of the city is more exposed to this natural input. The calcium \n\nlevels were significantly higher in the indoor environment of the city centre school than \n\nthose observed outdoors (p-value of 0.00129). The higher indoor levels are probably \n\nrelated to the use of chalk on the blackboard. This observation is corroborated by the high \n\ncarbonate (CO3\n2-) concentrations in the classrooms. The indoor carbonate concentrations \n\n\n\n \n217 \n\nwere about 16-20 times the amounts found outdoors during the weekdays. Carbonates \n\nrepresented approximately 1.2% of the PM10 mass for both schools. Magnesium \n\nrepresented one of the less abundant ions in the indoor environment. The outdoor \n\nmagnesium concentrations at the suburban school were significantly higher than those \n\nmeasured indoors (p-value of 0.0006122), and the suburban outdoor levels were higher \n\nthan those of the corresponding environment at the city centre school (p-value of \n\n0.001759).  \n\nCarbonaceous components (EC and OC) presented higher levels inside than outside \n\n(Table 6.3). Indoor OC sources seem to be mainly related to student room occupancy and \n\ntheir activities, like small particles of paper, skin debris and clothing fibres. OC constituted \n\nthe major mass fraction, accounting for almost 30% and 20% of PM10 in the city centre and \n\nsuburban schools, respectively. Elemental carbon contributed, on average, to 3.4% and \n\n1.6% of the particle mass in these two educational establishments. The indoor OC \n\nconcentrations were found to be significantly higher than those outdoors for the city centre \n\nand suburban schools (p-value of 3.4e-05 and 4.404e-05, respectively). EC indoor \n\nconcentrations observed in the city centre school were statistically higher than the values \n\nmeasured in the classroom of the suburban building (p-value of 0.002417). The outdoor \n\nlevels obtained for the inner-city institution were also significantly higher than those \n\nmeasured at the playground of the suburban establishment (p-value of 0.003145).  \n\n \n\n6.3.3. Organic speciation of particles \n \n\nThe chromatographically resolved organic compounds in the particulate phase \n\nencompassed aliphatics, PAHs, n-alkanols, sugars, polyols, and several types of acids \n\n(Figure 6.3). Besides n-alkenes, the aliphatic fraction comprised n-alkanes that exhibited a \n\nlack of odd-to-even carbon number predominance with Cmax at C26, C28 and C29. Carbon \n\npreferences indices close to 1 (Table 6.5 and 6.6), together with the presence of petrogenic \n\ntracers (e.g. hopanes), whether in classrooms or in outdoor air, reflect the contribution of \n\nvehicular sources (Alves, 2008). The influence of traffic emissions on the indoor air \n\nquality is corroborated by the values of diagnostic ratios between PAHs (Figure 6.4), \n\nwhich fall in the ranges reported for catalyst-equipped vehicles (Alves, 2008; Bi et al., \n\n\n\n \n218 \n\n2003; Call\u00e9n et al., 2011). In some days, however, the PAH ratios reflect the influence of \n\nindustrial emissions on the PM10 collected in the suburban school. The BaP dose \n\nequivalent (BaPE) for each PAH is calculated by multiplication of the measured \n\nconcentrations by the respective potency equivalent factor (PEF). The PEF values were \n\ntaken from Delgado-Saborit et al. (2011), who presented a compilation of data based on a \n\nliterature review. The BaP dose equivalent is then calculated as a sum to express the \n\ncarcinogenicity of the mixture: \n\n \n\nii xPEFPAHBaPE ?=                                                                                                    (6.3) \n\n \n\nThe levels of carcinogenic PAHs (Figure 6.5) were in the typical ranges reported for USA \n\nand Europe (Call\u00e9n et al., 2011; Jung et al., 2010; Mantis et al., 2005) and much lower than \n\nthose measured in Asia (e.g. Fang et al., 2002). The PEFs were also used to calculate the \n\nproportion of total carcinogenic potential represented by each individual PAH: \n\n \n\n( ) ( )\n( )\n\n100.%\n1\n\nx\nRCxPEF\n\nRCxPEF\nPotentialCarc\n\nN\n\ni i\n\ni\ni\n\n? =\n=                                                                    (6.4) \n\n \n\n \n\nwhere RC is the ratio of the individual PAHs to the carcinogenic marker BaP. Figure 6.5 \n\nshows the individual carcinogenic activity for both indoor and outdoor environments. The \n\ncompound that contributes most to the total carcinogenic potential of the PAH mixture was \n\nalways BaP, with average values higher than 61%. Its contribution to total carcinogenicity \n\nwas slightly higher indoors than outdoors. The second or third highest contributors were \n\nbenzo[k]flouranthene and chrysene with average shares of 12-14% and 12-16%, \n\nrespectively. While the contribution from chrysene was higher outdoors, that of \n\n\n\n \n219 \n\nbenzo[k]flouranthene did not show any clear pattern. The carcinogenic risk was calculated \n\nas follows: \n\n \n\nxURxPEFPAHriskicCarcinogen ii=                                                                              (6.5) \n\n \n\n  \n\nwhere UR represents the cancer unit risk, i.e. the excess cancer risk associated with an \n\ninhalation of 1 \u00b5 g m-3 of a compound. It is obtained by multiplication of the cancer \n\npotency factor for BaP [3.9 (mg kg?1 d?1)?1] by the reference child inspiration rate per day \n\n(12.4 m3) and dividing by the reference child body weight (21 kg) multiplied by a \n\nconversion factor from mg to ng of 106 (Bari et al., 2011; Elert et al., 2011). The \n\ncarcinogenic risk to occupants from the suburban and city centre schools was found to be \n\nin the ranges 4.4\u00d710-8-2.4\u00d710-7 and 1.2\u00d710-7-2.3\u00d710-7, respectively. In general, USEPA \n\nconsiders excess cancer risks that are below about one chance in a million (1\u00d710-6) to be so \n\nsmall as to be negligible.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n220 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3.

The strong even carbon number \n\npredominance reflects a dual biogenic origin: (i) waxes from terrestrial vegetation, in the \n\ncase of the higher weight homologs, and (ii) microbial lipids, in the case of homologues &lt;\n\nC20.  \n\nAmong acids, unsaturated compounds, such as palmitoleic (C16:1), oleic (C18:1) and \n\nlinoleic (C18:2), were one of the most representative groups. The presence of these acids in \n\natmospheric particles has been attributed to cooking emissions (He et al., 2004). Due to \n\ntheir reactivity, these fatty acids are often used as an indication of the ageing of the \n\naerosols. For most days, the C18:0/C18:1 and C18:0/C18:2 concentration ratios were lower than \n\n0.6, whether indoors or outdoors, indicating recent genesis of the unsaturated fatty acids \n\n(Alves et al., 2007). In spite of the presence of constituents from cooking fumes in the \n\nparticulate matter, the contribution of this source to VOCs is not so obvious. It should be \n\nnoted, however, that the dominant VOCs emitted during cooking activities were not \n\nsearched for in the present study. In fact, it has been reported that formaldehyde, \n\nacetaldehyde, and low molecular weight alkanals, 2-alkenals, 2-alkanones and dicarbonyls \n\nare major VOCs in emissions from cooking (Fullana et al., 2004; Schauer et al., 2002). \n\nAlkanedioic acids, ranging from the C3 (propanedioic) to the C9 homologue \n\n(nonanedioic) were detected in PM10. Dicarboxylic acids &lt;C10 may be originated from \n\nvehicle emissions, meat cooking, biomass burning or atmospheric oxidative processes \n\n(Alves et al., 2007). The presence of some diacids in PM10 may be associated with \n\nvegetation detritus as they are present in the guttation fluids, fruits and tissues of plants. \n\nAdditionally, they may be originated from the ozonolyis of sporopollenin of spores and \n\npollen grains (Oliveira et al., 2007; and references therein). Indoor concentrations were \n\nhigher than those measured in the school yards, suggesting accumulation of these \n\nconstituents inside the buildings and/or that part of them can be generated indoors. \n\nSignificant amounts of other oxygenated species, some of which are thought to be photo-\n\noxidation products of volatile organic compounds, from both biogenic and/or \n\nanthropogenic origin, were identified in the PM10 samples. These include hydrocarboxylic \n\nacids, oxocarboxylic acids and terpene diacids. The global outdoor levels in the suburban \n\nschools were 3-times higher than those measured in the city centre establishment, although \n\n\n\n \n224 \n\nthe indoor values were comparable. Benzoic acid, a secondary product from photochemical \n\ndegradation of aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene emitted by automobiles (Ho et al., \n\n2011), was one of the secondary organic aerosol (SOA) products observed in samples. \n\nMost of the homologous ketocarboxylic acids (e.g. oxobutanoic and oxopentanoic), also \n\ndetected in this study, are secondarily produced via atmospheric photo-oxidation of organic \n\nprecursors and/or primarily formed by fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning and \n\nfurther oxidised into diacids (Wang et al., 2009). Pinic and pinonic acids, which represent \n\nphoto-oxidation products of terpenes emitted from vegetation (Alves, 2008, and references \n\ntherein), were present at higher concentrations outdoors. These pinene derivatives have \n\nbeen detected in ventilation ducts, where they can be formed at ambient levels of ozone \n\nand precursors (Fick et al., 2004). The presence of precursors in indoor air may have two \n\nsources, either from the outdoor environment or from recirculated indoor air.  \n\nThe occurrence of resin acids (isopimaric, abietic and dehydroabietic) in the indoor air \n\nindicates infiltration from the outdoor environment. These constituents are markers from \n\ngymnosperm (mainly conifer) fuel combustion (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011b). Conifer wood \n\nprocessing can be pointed out as another possible source of resin acids (Eriksson et al., \n\n2004). The wood dust released into the air contains these diterpenic acids, which are the \n\nmain constituents of the oleoresin of the coniferous tree species. The presence of carpentry \n\nworkshops and sawmills in the vicinity of the suburban school may explain the higher \n\nlevels observed in comparison with the city centre institution. Resin acids may also be \n\noriginated from a turpentine factory located on the outskirts of the city. Turpentine is \n\nproduced from distilling the resinous gum from pine trees. Frequently, during the late \n\nafternoon and the first few hours of the night, the prevailing winds transport the plume to \n\nthe city, and usually affect more the suburban school than the city centre school.  \n\nSaccharides in atmospheric particles originate from different source types. \n\nMicroorganisms, plants and animals can release into the atmosphere primary saccharides \n\n(monosaccharides including glucose, fructose, xylose and disaccharides, such as sucrose \n\nand trehalose), whereas fungi, lichens and bacteria produce saccharidic polyols, also \n\ndenoted as sugar alcohols, such as arabitol, mannitol and sorbitol (Caseiro et al., 2007). \n\nAnhydrosaccharides, on the other hand, such as levoglucosan derived from cellulose, and \n\ngalactosan and mannosan, derived from hemicelluloses, are the primary thermal \n\n\n\n \n225 \n\ndegradation products of structural polysaccharides present in biomass (Gon\u00e7alves et al., \n\n2011). The average I/O obtained in the city centre and suburban schools for the global \n\nconcentrations of sugars and polyols were, respectively, 4.1 and 5.7, reflecting the \n\nrepresentativeness of bioparticles in the indoor air.  \n\nLevoglucosan is commonly used as a tracer for wood combustion in urban atmosphere \n\n(e.g. Oliveira et al., 2007). However, taking into account that the sampling campaign was \n\ncarried out in spring, emissions from residential wood combustion for heating purposes are \n\nthought to represent a minor contribution. Levoglucosan was detected in Chinese cooking \n\nsource profiles (He et al., 2004; Hou et al., 2008). The high temperature during cooking \n\nprocesses would lead to the emission of levoglucosan due to thermal degradation of \n\nvegetable cellulose. Spices such as Cumimum cyminum and Capsicum (powder of dry \n\nvegetables) used as condiments can also decompose to form levoglucosan (Hou et al., \n\n2008). Thus, in addition to woodstoves and/or open-hearth cooking in restaurants in the \n\nschool surroundings, food preparation in these commercial spaces may likely contribute to \n\nlevoglucosan emissions. The open field burning of garden and agriculture residues may \n\nrepresent an additional source of anhydrosugars and other compounds to the aerosol, \n\nespecially in the suburban school.  \n\nOrganophosphate esters and six phthalate esters were detected in PM10 from both \n\nschools. Both groups of these semi-volatile compounds are widely incorporated as \n\nadditives into plastic materials used in the indoor environment, thus contributing to the \n\nindoor exposure to industrial chemicals. I/O ratios ranging from 4 to 14 and from 1 to 9 \n\nwere obtained in the city centre and suburban schools, respectively. \n\nSqualene, a constituent of skin flakes (Weschler et al., 2011), was almost exclusively \n\nfound in indoor samples, pointing out skin desquamation as a major source. \n\n \n\n6.4. Conclusions \n\n \n\nComparison of weekday and weekend data demonstrated that school activity and indoor \n\nsources increase loadings of many gas and particle pollutants. Almost all of the identified \n\n\n\n \n226 \n\nVOCs showed I/O ratios higher than one, and especially dichloromethane, suggesting the \n\npresence of important indoor sources in both schools. The daily profiles of CO2 suggest \n\nthat the classrooms are inadequately ventilated, which likely favours accumulation of \n\npollutants in indoor air. Vehicle emissions contributed to I/O NO2 ratios lower than 1 and \n\nto PAH ratios typical of this source. However, the benzo[a]pyrene equivalent \n\nconcentrations were lower than the WHO target value and the carcinogenic risk to \n\noccupants from the suburban and city centre schools was found to be negligible. Only 26% \n\nof PM10 were of ambient origin. Indoor sources of organic matter have a strong impact on \n\nindoor PM10 concentrations (small particles of paper, skin and cloth particles). All the \n\ncarbonaceous fractions showed a significant enrichment in the indoor environment. Chalk \n\nused in classrooms could explain the higher indoor concentrations of carbonate. Outdoor \n\nparticulate infiltration leads to direct transportation into indoors of vehicle emissions and \n\nbiomass burning smoke likely coming from solid fuel use in restaurants and bakeries. The \n\neffect of cooking activities in the restaurants on the indoor air particulate level in city \n\ncentre school nearby is important. The cooking activities around this school release \n\nsignificant amounts of oily fumes from kitchens to outdoor air, which infiltrate into the \n\nclassrooms. The suburban school was more exposed to industrial emissions than the city \n\ncentre institution. \n\nThis type of study should be extended to other schools in order to be better able to \n\nsustain IAQ management strategies, and to apply source apportionment methodologies. \n\nFuture investigations should also evaluate the toxicological aspects related to the PM \n\nexposure in schools in comparison to PM exposure in outdoor air.  \n\n \n \n\n6.5.

COULD HOUSEPLANTS IMPROVE INDOOR AIR QUALITY IN \nSCHOOLS? \n \n\nPublished \n\nPegas, P.N., Alves, C.A., Nunes, T., Bate-Epey, E.F., Evtyugina, M., Pio, C.A., In Press. \n\nCould houseplants improve indoor air quality in schools? Journal of Toxicology and \n\nEnvironmental Health, Part A [ISSN: 1093-7404]. \n\n \n\nAbstract \n\nPrevious studies performed by the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) \n\nindicated that plants and associated soil microorganisms can be used to reduce indoor \n\npollutant levels. This study investigated the ability of plants to improve indoor air quality \n\nin schools. A nine-week intensive monitoring campaign of indoor and outdoor air pollution \n\nwas carried out in 2011 in a primary school of Aveiro, Portugal. Measurements included \n\ntemperature, CO2, CO, concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbonyls \n\nand particulate matter (PM10) without and with plants in a classroom. PM10 samples were \n\nanalysed for the water soluble inorganic ions, as well for the carbonaceous fractions. After \n\nhanging 6 potted plants from the ceiling, the mean CO2 concentration decreased from 2004 \n\nto 1121 ppm. The total VOC average concentrations in the indoor air during periods of \n\noccupancy without and with the presence of potted plants were, respectively, 933 and 249 \n\n\u00b5g m-3. The daily PM10 levels in the classroom during the occupancy periods were always \n\nhigher than those outdoors. The presence of potted plants likely favoured a decrease of \n\nabout 30% in PM10 concentrations. Our findings corroborate the results of NASA studies \n\nsuggesting that plants can clean indoor air and make interior breathing spaces healthier. \n\nKey words: indoor air quality, VOCs, carbonyls, PM10, plants, school. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n240 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n241 \n\n7.1. Introduction \n\n \n\nVarious studies have demonstrated that plants can be used to remove pollutants \n\nfrom indoor air (e.g. Liu et al., 2007; Matsumoto and Yamaguchi, 2007; Wolverton et al., \n\n1989; Wood et al., 2006). Plants have been pointed out as an attractive and cost effective \n\nway to improve indoor air quality (IAQ). Indoor potted-plants have been shown to remove \n\nmost types of airborne pollutants arising from either outdoor or indoor sources. The \n\nbenefits of plants on attendance and wellbeing of building occupants has been documented \n\n(Berg, 2002; Fjeld, 2002).  \n\nThis issue arose when the National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) \n\ntried to find ways to reduce pollutants inside future space habitats (NASA, 1974). \n\nWolverton et al. (1984, 1985, 1989) placed potted plants inside sealed plexiglass chambers, \n\ninjecting substances commonly found in indoor air. The results showed that leaves, soil, \n\nand plant-associated microorganisms have an important function in reducing indoor air \n\npollutants (cigarette smoke, organic solvents, and bioaerosol).  \n\nIn schools, IAQ is often much worse than outdoor air quality (Kotzias et al., 2009; \n\nPegas et al., 2010; Pegas et al., 2011a, b). Studies carried out by the USA Environmental \n\nProtection Agency (EPA) indicate that indoor air pollutant concentrations may be 2-5 \n\ntimes, and occasionally more than 100 times, higher than outdoor levels. \n\nThere are several reasons to consider IAQ at primary schools a public concern. One \n\nis that children breathe higher volumes of air, relatively to their body weights. Children's \n\nphysiological vulnerability to air pollution arises from their narrower airways and the fact \n\nthat their lungs are still developing. Also, many children breathe through their mouths, \n\nbypassing the nasal passages\u2019 natural defences. Thus, children are more likely to suffer the \n\nconsequences of indoor pollution. Another reason for environmental deficiencies in \n\nschools is due to chronic shortages of funding, which contribute to inadequate operation \n\nand maintenance of facilities (Mendell and Heath, 2005). \n\nPrevious measurements of particulate matter (PM10), volatile organic compounds \n\n(VOCs) and carbonyls carried out in elementary schools in Lisbon revealed indoor/outdoor \n\n\n\n \n242 \n\n(I/O) ratios above unity, showing the influence of indoor sources, building conditions and \n\ninappropriate ventilation on IAQ, and indicating the need to take decisive remedial actions \n\n(Almeida et al., 2011; Pegas et al., 2010; Pegas et al., 2011a, b). The main purpose of the \n\npresent study was to assess the effectiveness of three common species of houseplants in the \n\nfight against rising levels of air pollution in classrooms.  \n\n \n\n7.2 Material and Methods \n\n \n\n7.2.1 Study design \n\n \n\nThis study investigated the effectiveness of potted plants suggested by NASA (NASA, \n\n1974) in reducing the air pollutant concentrations in classrooms. A school located in the \n\ncity centre of Aveiro, Portugal, was selected to carry out this study. The selected school is \n\nlocated at 40\u00ba 38\u2019 16.76\u2019\u2019N; 8\u00ba 39\u2019 09.85\u2019\u2019W. This school started its activities in the sixties. \n\nIt is surrounded by commercial and residential buildings and in front of the school there is \n\na car parking and a busy road. The main classroom studied has wood floor, water based \n\npaint covering the walls, black board and chalk, white board and markers and five wood \n\nwindows. The area of the room was 52.5 m2. The number of students in the classroom is \n\naround 25. \n\nComfort parameters (temperature, relative humidity, CO2 and CO), VOCs, carbonyls \n\nand particulate matter &lt;10 \u00b5m (PM10) concentrations were measured between February  \n\nand May 2011, 3 weeks without plants (February 28th to March 20th 2011) and 6 weeks \n\nwith potted plants indoors (March 21st to May 28th 2011). \n\nDracaena deremensis (Striped dracaena or Janet Craig), Dracaena marginata (Red-\n\nedge Dracaena, Madagascar dragon tree or Marginata) and Spathiphyllum (Mauna loa or \n\nPeace lily) were the selected houseplants, since in test-chamber studies (Orwell et al., \n\n2004; Tarran et al., 2002; Wolverton et al., 1989; Wood et al., 2002; Wood et al., 2006) \n\nthey have been found to be reliably effective in removing benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene \n\nand xylenes (BTEX).  \n\n\n\n \n243 \n\nThe potted-plants were all of similar size, weight and age. In classrooms, they were \n\nplaced on metallic holders to ensure there was enough height from the floor and a free \n\nspace under the pot for air circulation (about 30 cm). The number of potted-plants was \n\ndefined according to the area of the classroom. The Associated Landscape Contractors of \n\nAmerica (ALCA) recommendation is one plant per 9.29 m2. Thus, six potted-plants (300 \n\nmm diameter pots) were placed in the selected classroom.  \n\n \n\n7.2.2 Sampling and analytical methods \n\n \n\nContinuous measurements of temperature, relative humidity (RH), CO2, CO and \n\ntotal VOCs were performed with an automatic portable Indoor Air IQ-610 Quality Probe \n\n(Gray Wolf\u00ae monitor) and a TSI monitor, simultaneously in the classroom and at the \n\nplayground, respectively, during 9 weeks. \n\nEvery week, during 9 weeks, passive samplers for VOCs and carbonyls (Radiello\u00ae) \n\nwere used to obtain indoor and outdoor average concentrations. Another set of Radiello \n\npassive samplers were only exposed from 8:30 AM to 17:30-18 PM to obtain VOC and \n\ncarbonyl concentrations for the occupancy periods.  \n\nVOCs adsorbed in activated charcoal cartridges were extracted with 2 mL of carbon \n\ndisulfide (CS2) containing the internal standard, in accordance with the Radiello\n? \n\nprocedure. Analyses were performed by gas chromatography (Thermo Scientific Trace GC \n\nUltra) coupled to a flame ionisation detection (GC/FID). The equipment was calibrated \n\nbefore and during the analyses of samples by injecting standard solutions of all compounds \n\nidentified in CS2 (Pegas et al., 2010). \n\nCarbonyls were extracted with 2 ml of acetonitrile during 30 minutes and the \n\nextract filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m membrane disc filters (filtration kit RAD 174) and \n\ninjected into the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. The carbonyl \n\nconcentrations were quantified with external calibration curves constructed from standard \n\nsolutions - Aldehyde/ketone-DNPH TO11/IP-6A Mix (USEPA, 1999). \n\n\n\n \n244 \n\nActive sampling of carbonyls was performed during two days in the first period \n\nwithout plants (March 24th and 25th) and during two days in the second period with plants \n\n(May 25th and 26th). Carbonyl active collection involved a sampling train consisting of a \n\nThomas pump to draw in air at a flow rate of 2 L min-1 for a sampling time of one or two \n\nhours in agreement with the classroom cycles, through silica gel cartridges, impregnated \n\nwith 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent (Sep-Pak\u00ae DNPH-Silica Cartridges), a dry gas \n\nmeter to measure the volume of air and ozone scrubbers to minimise ozone interferences. \n\nThe analytes were extracted with 5 mL of acetonitrile by filtration through gravity feed \n\nelution and the extract collected in 3 mL vials and later analysed by high-performance \n\nliquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection at absorption wavelength at 360 nm \n\n(ASTM, 1997).  \n\nTwo low volume samplers were used to collect simultaneously indoor and outdoor \n\nPM10 on a daily basis, during the occupancy period, from 8:30 AM to 17:30-18 PM, over a \n\nperiod of 9 weeks. The PM10 samples were collected onto pre-baked (6 h at 550\u00baC) quartz \n\nfilters 47 mm in diameter. Before weighting, the filters were conditioned in a desiccator at \n\nleast for 24 hours in a temperature and humidity-controlled room. Before and after \n\nsampling, the gravimetric determination was performed with a microbalance Mettler \n\nToledo AG245 (readability 0.1mg/0.01mg). Filter weights were obtained from the average \n\nof ten measurements, with weight variations less than 5%. \n\nThe elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC) content in PM10 was analysed by a \n\nhome-made thermal-optical transmission system, after passive exposure of sampled filters \n\nto HCl vapours to remove carbonate interferences. This procedure was at first developed \n\nby Carvalho et al. (2006) and recently adapted by Alves et al. (2011). Carbonates present \n\nin PM10 samples were analysed through the release of CO2, and measured by the same non-\n\ndispersive infrared analyser coupled to the thermo-optical system, when a punch of each \n\nfilter was acidified with orthophosphoric acid (20%) in a free CO2 gas stream (Alves et al. \n\n2011). \n\nFor the determination of water soluble inorganic ions (WSII), a filter fraction (2 \n\ndiscs of 13 mm of diameter) were extracted with ultra pure Milli-Q water. Dionex AS14 \n\nand CS12 chromatographic columns with Dionex AG14 and CG12 guard columns coupled \n\n\n\n \n245 \n\nto Dionex AMMS II and Dionex CMMS III suppressors, respectively for anions and \n\ncations, have been used. \n\nTo evaluate the significance of differences between variables, the non-parametric \n\nMann-Whitney U test was preferred rather than the Student\u2019s t-test (Browm and Hambley, \n\n2002). A difference between two means was considered to be statistically significant when \n\nthe p-value of the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test was lower than 0.05. All statistical \n\ncomputations were conducted with the R software (http://www.r-project.org/).  \n\n \n\n7.3 Results and discussion \n\n \n\nThe indoor average temperature ranged from18.7\u00b11.99oC in the first period of the \n\nstudy, without plants, to 24.0\u00b12.22oC in the second period, with plants. The RH values did \n\nnot change appreciably throughout the campaign (55.9\u00b18.32% and 51.7\u00b17.98%). The CO \n\nconcentrations in the classroom were always low (0.05\u00b10.04 ppm). However, the CO2 \n\nlevels (Figure 7.1) were significantly different between the period without (2004\u00b1580 \n\nppm) and with plants (1121\u00b1600 ppm) in the classroom (p-value of 0.001). Many studies \n\ndemonstrated that high levels of CO2 could cause a negative influence on students\u2019 \n\nlearning ability (Coley and Greeves, 2004; Shendell et al., 2004; Smedje et al., 1996). It \n\nshould be noted, that during the entire campaign the windows were kept closed. During the \n\nhottest days, three exceptions to this condition were registered, when one or two windows \n\nwere partially opened for a few minutes. Taking into account that these extents of time \n\nwith higher natural ventilation represented less than 5% of the occupancy period, the \n\npossible dilution effect of concentrations was considered negligible. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n246 \n\n \n\nFigure 7.1. Indoor and outdoor average CO2 concentration week by week. \n\n \n\n \n\nThe National System for Energy and Indoor Air Quality Certification of Buildings \n\nestablishes an acceptable maximum value (AMV) for the CO2 concentrations of 1000 ppm \n\nin indoor environments in Portugal (RSECE, 2006). Over the period without plants, as well \n\nduring the week of their acclimatisation, the CO2 concentrations were always much higher \n\nthan the AMV. High indoor CO2 levels are normally considered as indicative of inadequate \n\nventilation. Based on indoor and outdoor CO2 concentrations, it is possible to estimate \n\nventilation rates under different degrees of window openings or when they are fully closed. \n\nWhen unoccupied there is no CO2 emission from the tenants, so the ventilation rate can be \n\nobtained by: \n\n??\n?\n\n?\n??\n?\n\n?\n\n?\n?\n\n\u00d7?=\next\n\nextt\n\nCC\n\nCC\n\nt\n\nV\nQ\n\n0\n\nln                                                                                            (7.1) \n\nwhere Ct is the indoor concentration of CO2 at time t (ppm), Cext the concentration of CO2 \n\nin the external air (ppm), C0 the concentration of CO2 in the indoor air at time 0 (ppm), Q \n\n\n\n \n247 \n\nthe ventilation rate of air entering the space (m3 s-1), V the volume of the classroom (m3) \n\nand t is the interval since t=0 (s) (Griffiths and Eftekhari, 2008). \n\nThe estimated ventilation rates ranged from 11 to 23 L s-1. The maximum ventilation \n\nvalue, which corresponds to about 0.9 L s-1 per person, represented only 35% of the \n\nminimum value of 2.5 L s-1 per person recommended by the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62-\n\n1999, and only 10% of that recommended by RSECE (8.33 L s-1 per person). The CO2 \n\nlevels measured from the 5th week onwards, during the occupancy periods, were not as \n\nhigh as those of the first three weeks, in the absence of plants (Figure 7.1). Tarran et al. \n\n(2007), in a study aiming at evaluating the capacity of indoor plants to remove pollutants, \n\nreported that CO2 concentrations were reduced by about 10% in air-conditioned offices and \n\nby about 25% in naturally ventilated rooms.  \n\nConcentrations of VOCs were always higher indoors than outdoors, including \n\nnighttime periods (Figure 7.2). A concentration decrease during the non-occupancy period \n\nwas observed. Higher indoor levels of many VOC species were also registered in previous \n\nstudies involving 14 elementary schools of the Portuguese capital, Lisbon (Pegas et al., \n\n2010, 2011a, b). The VOC concentrations during teaching periods ranged from 933 \u00b1 577 \n\n\u00b5g m-3 in the absence to 249 \u00b1 74.2 \u00b5g m-3 in the presence of plants. The difference \n\nbetween VOC levels without and with plants was statistically significant (p-value of \n\n0.035). The approximately 73% reduction of VOC concentrations observed in this study is \n\nin line with the results of previous investigations in 60 offices by Wood et al. (2006), who \n\ntested the effectiveness of potted-plant and root-zone microcosms with and without air-\n\nconditioning. It has been observed by these authors that the root-zone microcosm could \n\nsubstantially reduce high concentrations of VOCs within 24 hours. In the current study, the \n\ndecrease of indoor VOC levels was observed whether in samples obtained during school \n\nhours or in weekly samples continuously exposed. The main difference between the two \n\nsets of samples is the magnitude of concentrations. VOC levels in weekly samples \n\ncontinuously exposed, as obtained in previous works in Portugal (Pegas et al., 2010, \n\n2011a,b), do not truly reflect the levels of exposure. Outside the room, the VOC levels \n\nremained almost uniform over the entire sampling period (Figure 7.2). Methylacetate, \n\n1,1,1-trichloroethane and isopropanol were systematically more abundant in the classroom. \n\nAcetone, methanol and 1,1,1-trichloroethane were prevalent outdoors. These compounds \n\n\n\n \n248 \n\nmay derive from both indoor and outdoor sources, including felt pens, personal care \n\nproducts, PVC cement and primer, various adhesives, contact cement, model cement, \n\ndegreasers, aerosol penetrating oils, brake cleaner, carburettor cleaner, commercial \n\nsolvents, electronics cleaners, spray lubricants, etc. (Mendell, 2007).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.2. Indoor and outdoor concentrations of all VOCs identified.  \n\n \n\n \n\nAmong all monitored VOCs, BTEX are of particular interest due to their known \n\ncarcinogenic effects (Kotzias et al., 2009). Ethylbenzene showed a decrease from levels in \n\nthe 1.48-2.53 \u00b5g m-3 range during the period without plants to values below the detection \n\nlimit during the period with potted-plants indoors. The average toluene concentrations \n\nwere 7.62 \u00b1 1.73 \u00b5g m-3 and 4.09 \u00b1 0.66 \u00b5g m-3, respectively, when plants were absent or \n\npresent, showing a decrease of about 57%. A reduction of 80% between the two periods \n\nwas observed in m+p-xylene and o-xylene concentrations. Benzene is a carcinogenic \n\ncompound to which the WHO has not yet established a guide or safe value (WHO, 2000). \n\n\n\n \n249 \n\nThe average benzene concentration was 1.09 \u00b1 0.21 \u00b5g m-3 in the absence of plants, \n\ndecreasing to 0.84 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5g m-3 during the presence of potted vegetation, which represents \n\na decline of almost 15%. Outdoor toluene, ethylbenzene, m+p-xylene and o-xylene levels \n\nwere significantly lower than air concentrations in the classroom, reflecting the \n\ncontribution of indoor sources. Although Wolverton (1989) has found a reduction in \n\nbenzene concentration in controlled chambers of 77.3, 79.5 and 79.0% for the species Janet \n\nCraig, Marginata and Peace Lily, respectively, in the classroom, this reduction did not \n\nexceed 15%. However, it is important to note that the chamber experiments refer to static \n\ntesting, where pollutants are injected and then their decay is measured. A classroom is an \n\nopen system and there are many other cross-factors influencing concentration values. The \n\nbenzene levels were always within the same order of magnitude or smaller than the outside \n\nconcentrations, denoting that the major contribution is likely from the outdoor \n\nenvironment.  \n\nCarbonyl compounds are the most important chemical contaminants affected by \n\nchemical and physical processes in the environment (Cer\u00f3n et al., 2007). Among the five \n\ncarbonyls identified in the indoor environment, butyraldehyde (40.8 \u00b1 2.20 \u00b5g m-3) and \n\nformaldehyde (22.6 \u00b1 3.54 \u00b5g m-3) were the most abundant in the classroom in the absence \n\nof plants. Formaldehyde is a ubiquitous pollutant that could be found in almost all indoor \n\nand outdoor environments. Formaldehyde indoor sources include pressed wood products \n\nand furniture, insulation, combustion and tobacco smoke, some textiles and glues. Figure \n\n7.3 shows that there was a significant decrease in the sum of carbonyl concentrations after \n\nhanging potted plants from the ceiling in the classroom (p-value of 0.035). During the first \n\nthree weeks without plants, the sum of aldehyde concentrations ranged from 81.3 to 94.3 \n\n\u00b5g m-3 at an average temperature of 18.7 \u00b1 1.90 \u00baC. Between the fifth and ninth weeks, \n\nwith plants in the classroom, the concentrations of total carbonyls ranged from 57.4 to 68.7 \n\n\u00b5g m-3 at an average temperature of 24.8 \u00b1 1.35 \u00baC. Even with increasing temperature, a \n\ndecrease in carbonyl concentrations of up to 40% was registered. Normally, the carbonyl \n\nconcentrations increase with increasing temperatures due to evaporation from building \n\nmaterials (Pang and Mu, 2006). In chamber studies with controlled conditions, the \n\ndecrease in formaldehyde concentration due to the effect of plants ranged from 47 to 70% \n\n(Wolverton et al., 1989). Results from active sampling in office environments suggested \n\nthat achieving an 11% reduction in formaldehyde levels in a real life situation would \n\n\n\n \n250 \n\nrequire the equivalent of one plant to each m3 or 2.4 plants to every m2 (Dingle et al., \n\n2000). Table 7.1 presents results from active samplings carried out before and after having \n\nplants in the classroom. An approximately 40% decrease in the indoor concentrations of \n\nthe four carbonyl compounds measured by active sampling, whose determination was also \n\ndone by passive sampling, was observed. The outdoor levels increased with increasing \n\ntemperature. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7.3. Indoor and outdoor concentrations of all carbonyls identified (passive \nsampling).  \n\n \n\nTable 7.1 Active sampling of carbonyls. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n251 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAtmospheric particles have been associated with increased respiratory symptoms \n\n(Delfino, 2002; Simoni et al., 2002; Weisel, 2002). Indoor PM10 may carry toxic pollutants \n\nand reaction products into the airways, inducing inflammatory responses through the \n\ngeneration of oxidative stress (Leem et al., 2005). In this experiment, the daily indoor PM10 \n\nlevels were always higher than those outdoors (Figure 7.4), suggesting that the physical \n\nactivity of the pupils leads to emission/resuspension of coarse particles and greatly \n\ncontributes to enhanced PM10 in classrooms (Almeida et al., 2011). Lohr and Pearson-\n\nMims (1996) reported an approximately 2% reduction in PM10 levels in a computer lab and \n\nin an office after introducing plants into these building environments. A statistically \n\nsignificant decrease in PM10 levels was observed in our study (p-value of 0.001). The \n\nindoor PM10 mean values ranged from 137 \u00b1 7.70 \u00b5g m\n-3, without plants, to 91.2 \u00b1 13.2 \u00b5g \n\nm-3, with plants (Figure 7.4). The outdoor PM10 mean values ranged from 28.2 \u00b1 5.78 \u00b5g \n\nm-3 in the first period to 38.2 \u00b1 14.4 \u00b5g m-3 in the second period of the campaign. Even \n\nwith an increase of about 35% of outdoor PM10 concentration, there was a reduction of \n\nabout 34% in the indoor levels. This could be related to the gravitational settling of \n\nparticles onto foliage and potting soil. Lohr and Pearson-Mims (1996) suggested that the \n\nplants do not simply block the fall of particles. Plants may also remove particulate matter \n\nthrough impaction of particles carried across their foliage by eddy currents. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n252 \n\n \n\nFigure 7.4. Indoor and outdoor PM10 concentrations week by week.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nOn average, the organic carbon represented a mass fraction of PM10 of 30.0% indoors. \n\nA lower mass fraction was obtained outdoors (OC/PM10=21.3%). The total carbon (TC = \n\nOC + EC) levels were higher indoors than outdoors (Figure 7.5). Clearly, OC is enriched \n\nin indoor, as compared to outdoor air. An indoor enhancement of OC/EC ratios is likely to \n\nbe due to indoor sources of organic compounds, such as submicron fragments of paper, \n\nskin debris and clothing fibres, among others. A decrease from 36.9 \u00b1 4.81 \u00b5g m-3 to 24.6 \n\n\u00b1 6.32 \u00b5g m-3 in the OC concentrations have been observed between the periods without \n\nand with plants, respectively (p-value of 0.001), whereas no significant difference was \n\nfound outdoors. There was no significant difference in EC levels between the two periods \n\nof the campaign and between the indoor and outdoor air (Figure 7.5).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n253 \n\n \n\nFigure 7.5. Indoor and outdoor carbon mass concentration week by week.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nThe water soluble ions contributed, on average, to 20.4% and 14.1% of the particle \n\nmass in the classroom and playground, respectively (Figure 7.6). Carbonate was the \n\ndominant ion of indoor-sampled particles, representing, on average, 10.2% of the mass of \n\nall analysed ions. Carbonate levels in the indoor air ranged from 21.8 \u00b1 1.33 \u00b5g m-3, \n\nwithout plants, to 6.93 \u00b1 2.31 \u00b5g m-3, in the presence of plants (p-value of 0.004). The \n\nreduction of carbonate levels was followed by a concomitant reduction in calcium levels \n\nfrom 4.25 \u00b1 0.66 \u00b5g m-3 to 2.78 \u00b1 0.81 \u00b5g m-3, without and with plants, respectively (p-\n\nvalue of 0.004). Compared with other soluble ions, the calcium mass fractions were higher \n\nin the indoor environment (2.76% of the PM10 mass) than those observed outdoors (0.76% \n\nof the PM10 mass). The higher indoor levels are probably related to the use of chalk \n\ncrayons on the blackboard. This observation is corroborated by the high carbonate \n\nconcentrations in the classrooms. The indoor carbonate concentrations were about 10 times \n\n\n\n \n254 \n\nthe amounts found outdoors during the weekdays. Magnesium represented one of the less \n\nabundant ions in the indoor and outdoor environments. The outdoor sodium and chloride \n\nlevels were about 2 times higher than the indoor levels, probably because these two ions \n\nlikely have a strong contribution from sea spray. A statistically significant reduction in \n\nlevels of nitrate, sulphate and ammonia between periods in the absence and presence of \n\nplants was observed (p-value of 0.001, 0.001 and 0.001, respectively). Atmospheric PM, \n\nand especially some of its constituents (e.g. nitrates and ammonium) may affect vegetation \n\ndirectly following deposition on foliar surfaces or indirectly by changing soil chemistry. \n\nIndirect effects through the soil, however, are usually the most significant because they can \n\nalter nutrient cycling (Grantza et al., 2003; Prajapati, 2012). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n255 \n\n \n\nFigure 7.6. Indoor and outdoor soluble ion concentrations week by week.  \n \n\n \n\n \n\n7.4 Conclusions \n\n \n\nThis study tried to determine if common houseplants are useful in improving \n\noverall indoor air quality. In spite of some possible confounding factors (e.g. variable \n\nventilation rates throughout the monitoring campaign) that could lead to misinterpretation \n\nof results, it seems that plants do have the ability to remove ordinary pollutants from the \n\n\n\n \n256 \n\nair. After the placement of six potted-plants in the classroom, a statistically significant \n\nreduction in CO2, VOCs, carbonyl, PM10, OC, nitrate, sulphate, ammonia, calcium, and \n\ncarbonate concentrations was observed. The decrease in indoor air pollutant levels \n\nresulting from the use of plants may represent a low-cost solution to reduce exposure to \n\nmany compounds and lifetime risk, and further improve performance, attendance and \n\nwelfare of students and teachers in classrooms. This simple measure does not invalidate, \n\nhowever, the adoption of other abatement or preventive strategies, such as to the use low \n\nVOC emitting materials and consumer products, lowering the occupancy rates in \n\nclassrooms, use of air cleaner and humidity control systems, and increasing the ventilation \n\nrates (through natural openings or mechanical devices).  \n\nTaking into account that the rate at which the plants metabolise the air pollutants \n\ndepends on the growing conditions and that the removal performance depends on the plant \n\nspecies, further research is needed. This study provides some clues that this is an important \n\nissue to pursue, especially as it may relate to potential human health effects. \n\n \n\n7.5 References \n\n \n\nAlmeida, S.M., Canha, N., Silva, A., Freitas, M.C., Pegas, P.N., Alves, C.A., Evtyugina, \n\nM., Pio, C., 2011.

GENERAL CONCLUSIONS \n \n\nIndoor and outdoor concentrations of VOCs, carbonyls, NO2, PM10, OC, EC, \n\ncarbonates, water soluble ions, organic compounds in PM10, microbiological components \n\nand comfort parameters (CO2, CO, temperature and RH) were measured in elementary \n\nschools in Lisbon and in Aveiro in different periods between December 2008 and May \n\n2011. The results suggest that IAQ in schools is worse than that of outdoor air, in line with \n\nwhat has been reported for many regions worldwide.   \n\nThe ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55-200418 recommends indoor temperature ranges \n\nfrom 20 to 23\u00baC in the autumn/winter seasons and from 23 to 26\u00baC in the spring/summer \n\nseasons. The suggested indoor RH values are in the 30\u201360% range. The winter \n\ntemperatures in classrooms were not satisfactory since average values of 14\u00baC and 18\u00ba \n\nwere, respectively, obtained in Lisbon and Aveiro, during the occupancy periods. In \n\nLisbon schools, either in autumn or in winter, uncomfortably high values of relative \n\nhumidity were registered, likely contributing to mould thriving. Thermal comfort is a key \n\ncomponent of quality of indoor environments. Elements such as lack of heating systems, \n\nlack of adequate ventilation, high humidity levels, and poorly performing building \n\nenvelopes can contribute to poor thermal comfort. If these elements are not addressed, \n\nschools leave both teachers and students in an environment in which they must adapt to \n\npoor comfort levels. This can be distracting to students and teachers, and likely reduce \n\ntheir productivity.  \n\nThe Portuguese Legislation (Decree-Law 79/2006) defines a maximum value of \n\n500 CFU m-3 indoors. However, taking into account the conditions found in schools, it is \n\nvery difficult, if not impossible, to control the amounts of airborne microorganisms in \n\nindoor air. According to the present results, there seems to be a seasonal variability in \n\nbioaerosol concentrations. There is a trend towards a higher indoor microbial concentration \n\nin the warmer season with respect to colder periods. In all seasons and in both cities, the \n\nbacterial and fungal colony forming units surpassed the Portuguese guidelines. \n\nMicroorganisms in indoor air originate not only from the activities of occupants, but also \n\nfrom contaminated building materials, furnishings, and from outdoor air. Thus, inadequate \n\n\n\n \n266 \n\nventilations, poor hygienic conditions in schools, overcrowded classrooms and high RH \n\nvalues favour microbial growth.  \n\nAt concentrations occurring in most indoor environments, CO2 build up can be \n\nconsidered as a surrogate for other occupant-generated pollutants, and for ventilation rate \n\nper occupant, but not as a causal factor in human health responses. Whether ASHRAE or \n\nthe Portuguese legislation recommend that CO2 levels do not exceed 1000 ppm or 1800 mg \n\nm-3. The average CO2 levels in Lisbon and Aveiro schools were about 2000 mg m\n-3, with \n\npeaks of 3000 mg m-3. During the test of houseplants inside a classroom, a statistical \n\nsignificant decrease of the CO2 levels was observed, showing the positive effect of \n\nphytoremediation on IAQ. Improving ventilation rates and the presence of recommended \n\nplants may contribute to the decrease of CO2 levels and to prevent other contaminants from \n\naccumulating. Concomitant increases of CO2 and CO concentrations suggest a direct \n\nrelationship between increasing concentrations and classroom occupancies. It should be \n\nnoted, however, that CO levels were always lower than 1 mg m-3 in all schools, i.e. were \n\nfar below the threshold of 12.5 mg m-3 stipulated by the Portuguese legislation and the \n\nWHO guidelines.  \n\nGenerally, the NO2 concentrations were higher outdoors than indoors, probably as a \n\nresult of vehicular emissions from nearby traffic and other combustion processes in the \n\nurban environment. The indoor NO2 average levels ranged from 10 to 46 \u00b5g m\n-3 showing \n\nlower values during the winter, possibly because the windows and the doors were always \n\nclosed, isolating the classroom environment of emissions from the outside, or because NO2 \n\nindoor concentrations decayed by gas-phase processes or by reactions on the inner surfaces \n\nof furniture. Even if the NO2 concentrations were lower in the classrooms; in some \n\nschools, the average values exceeded the WHO recommendation of 40 \u00b5g m-3.  \n\nMost of the assessed VOCs occurred at I/O ratios above unity, in all seasons, \n\nshowing the important influence of indoor sources and building conditions on IAQ. \n\nHowever, it has been observed that higher indoor VOC concentrations occur often in the \n\ncolder months in Lisbon schools. The winter VOC concentrations ranged from 84 to 2175 \n\n\u00b5g m-3, the autumn concentrations ranged from 11 to 922 \u00b5g m-3, and finally, the spring \n\nVOC concentrations ranged from 37 to 317 \u00b5g m-3. Higher levels in wintertime are \n\nprobably related to the fact that classrooms remained longer with closed windows to \n\n\n\n \n267 \n\nmaintain thermal comfort, contributing to a gradual accumulation of pollutants from indoor \n\nand outdoor sources. The outdoor pollutants have the capacity of entering buildings and \n\nthey suffer accumulation inside the room, due to low air exchange rates. Higher \n\ntemperatures in the warmer seasons, together with enhanced ventilations due to  opening of \n\nwindows by users, likely favoured both the volatilisation and dilution of VOCs. In Aveiro, \n\nthe indoor VOC concentrations were always higher during the occupancy period. A \n\nreduction of 73% of indoor VOC levels was observed after placement of plants in one \n\nclassroom.  \n\nIn all studied places, the indoor carbonyl concentrations were higher than those \n\noutside. Generally, formaldehyde was the most abundant carbonyl compound found in \n\nschools. In Lisbon, the indoor formaldehyde levels were higher in spring (3.4 \u2013 42.3 \u00b5g m-\n\n3) than those measured in autumn (3.1 26.2 \u00b5g m-3) and winter (6.3 \u2013 23.8 \u00b5g m-3). \n\nCarbonyl concentrations were higher in warmer months, due to increased emissions from \n\nfurniture with increasing sun-light intensity. In Aveiro, even with a substantial increase in \n\ntemperatures (from 18.7 to 24.8\u00baC), a decrease in carbonyl concentrations of 40% was \n\nobserved following the placing of plants in one classroom (81.3-94.3 \u00b5g m-3 to 57.4 - 68.7 \n\n\u00b5g m-3).  \n\nThe daily indoor PM10 levels (72.8 \u2013 49.2 \u00b5g m\n-3), measured in schools of Aveiro, \n\nwere always higher than those outdoors (43.4 \u2013 23.4 \u00b5g m-3), except on weekends, \n\nsuggesting that the physical activity of students and class works highly contributed to the \n\nemission and re-suspension of particles. Using the measured sulphate content on PM filters \n\nas an indicator for ambient PM sources, it was estimated that only about one quarter of \n\nPM10 was of ambient origin. Indoor sources, such as re-suspension by physical activities, \n\nsoil particles brought in shoes, blackboard dust, skin flakes, cloths and furniture fragments, \n\nbioaerosol and insects, have a strong impact on indoor PM10 concentrations. The presence \n\nof plants in the room contributed to a reduction of about 34% in the indoor levels (from \n\n137 to 91 \u00b5g m-3), even with an increase of about 35% of outdoor PM10 (from 28 to 38 \u00b5g \n\nm-3). This could be related to the capacity of houseplants attract and retain particles by \n\ngravitational settling onto foliage and potting soil.  \n\nOC was the particulate component contributing most to the indoor PM10 \n\nconcentrations measured in schools in Aveiro. Indoor OC sources seem to be mainly \n\n\n\n \n268 \n\nrelated to student room occupancy and their activities, such as small particles of paper, skin \n\ndebris and clothing fibres. A decrease in the OC average concentration was observed \n\nbetween the periods without (36.9 \u00b5g m-3) and with plants (24.6 \u00b5g m-3), whereas no \n\nsignificant difference was found outdoors. The average EC indoor concentrations observed \n\nin the city centre school of Aveiro (1.7 \u00b5g m-3) were higher than those measured in the \n\nindoor air of the suburban school (0.99 \u00b5g m-3), denoting a lower influence of traffic \n\nemissions on the outskirts. A possible indoor source of EC in primary schools could be \n\ngraphitic pencil largely used by children. There was no difference in EC levels without and \n\nwith plants indoors.  \n\nThe PM10 mass fraction of soluble inorganic ions was higher outdoors (30% and \n\n32%) than indoors (13% and 18%) for the city centre and the suburban school, \n\nrespectively, suggesting that the main sources of inorganic material are from outside. \n\nCarbonate was the dominant ion of indoor-sampled particles. Chalk used in classrooms \n\ncould explain the higher indoor concentrations of carbonate, calcium and potassium. The \n\nreduction of carbonate levels from 21.8 \u00b5g m-3 to 6.93 \u00b5g m-3 was followed by the \n\nconcomitant reduction in calcium levels, from 4.25 \u00b5g m-3 to 2.78 \u00b5g m-3, without and with \n\nplants, respectively. Nitrate, sulphate and ammonia concentrations also decreased after the \n\nplacement of recommended potted plants in one classroom of the city centre school of \n\nAveiro.  \n\nIn Aveiro, the influence of traffic emissions on the IAQ is corroborated by the \n\nvalues of diagnostic ratios between PAH, which fall in the ranges reported for catalyst-\n\nequipped vehicles. In some days, however, the PAH ratios reflected the influence of \n\nindustrial emissions on the PM10 collected in the suburban school. Homologous series of n-\n\nalkanes and n-alkanols (C10 \u2013 C30) and n-alkanoic acids (C6 \u2013 C28) were present in samples. \n\nIt was observed a strong even carbon number predominance, which reflects a dual biogenic \n\norigin: waxes from terrestrial vegetation and microbial lipids. The average concentrations \n\nof some organic tracers for biomass burning (levoglucosan, galactosan and mannosan) \n\nwere higher indoors than outdoors for both school locations. The input of biomass burning \n\ntracers  was more pronounced at the city centre school, showing the contribution of nearby \n\nrestaurants and bakeries for the elevated PM10 levels. Stearin and palmitoleic acid, organic \n\ntracers for cooking process, showed an important activity around the city centre school due \n\n\n\n \n269 \n\nto significant amounts of oily fumes from kitchens to outdoor air, which infiltrate into the \n\nclassroom. At the suburban school, this contribution was smaller.  \n\nA possible mitigation measure to decrease indoor air pollutant levels is the use \n\npotted plants in a number proportional to the volume of the room. This could be a low-cost \n\nsolution to reduce exposure to many compounds (like CO2, VOCs, carbonyl, PM10, OC, \n\nnitrate, sulphate, ammonia, calcium, and carbonate) and lifetime risk, and further improve \n\nperformance, attendance and welfare of students and teachers in classrooms. However, this \n\nsimple step can not be isolated and does not invalidate the adoption of other depletion or \n\npreventive strategies, like the use of low VOC emitting materials and consumer products, \n\nlowering the number of students per classroom, increasing the air exchange rates, and use \n\nof air cleaner and humidity control systems. The schools should be built in strategically \n\nplaces or \u201cgreen areas\u201d, where they are not directly affected by heavy traffic or industry or \n\nany other polluting sources at the neighbourhood. Floor covering and wall paint in \n\nclassrooms should be chosen with particular caution to avoid any adverse effects on the \n\nrespiratory health of children. New comprehensible instructions for good cleaning \n\npractices in schools should be provided and implemented. It is important to create new \n\npreventive and legal measures for controlling IAQ, such as imposition of periodic audits. \n\nFinally, it is indispensable to educate every one on IAQ. Students, teachers and other staff \n\nshould have information about sources, effects of contaminated air, and knowledge about \n\noperation of the ventilation system (when there is one) or the importance of efficient \n\nnatural ventilation and indoor air renovation.  \n\nHealth symptoms, like asthma, rhinitis and wheezing, are not only related to IAQ in \n\nschools. The prevalence of children with wheezing and allergic rhinitis has increased in \n\nrelation to the ISAAC studies of 2002/2003 and 2006 in the same city. The wheezing \n\nprevalence ranged from 26.7 to 30.1% between 2002/2003 and 2006, and then to 43.3% in \n\nthe present study carried out in 2008. The allergic rhinitis also increased from 26.9 to \n\n31.2%, and then to 42.9%, whereas the percentage of asthma cases has decreased slightly, \n\nfrom 9.2 to 7.8% and then to 5.6%. A decrease in the percentage of smoking parents was \n\nobserved. A small decrease in the number of breastfed children from 82.2% in 2002/2003, \n\nto 81.5% in 2006, and to 76.9% in 2008, was also registered. This decrease may be due to \n\nthe increasing number of women employed. Nevertheless, breastfeeding was not found as a \n\n\n\n \n270 \n\nsignificant protective factor for respiratory diseases, in statistical terms. Among variables \n\nrelated to eating habits, the only statistically significant correlation with respiratory \n\nsymptoms was found for egg consumption. The risk of manifestation of allergic rhinitis is \n\n90% higher in children who often eat eggs in comparison with those who never eat this \n\nfood. Differences in prevalence of respiratory symptoms obtained in several studies may \n\npoint out exposure to different risk factors, as well as variable racial, environmental, and \n\nsocioeconomic conditions, and heterogeneous diagnostic criteria.  \n\nFuture investigation is needed to determine the extent of IAQ problems in school \n\npopulation. Student\u2019s exposure to complex mixtures of air pollutants also reflects a \n\ncomplex mixture of microenvironments in which pupils spend their time, such as school, \n\nhome, public transportation, car or other way to commute, etc. Since children move \n\naround, including during school hours, the pollutants and concentrations to which they are \n\nexposed to vary according to the period of the day. Thus, the evaluation of an integrated \n\ndaily exposure to air pollutants by personal and area sampling in different \n\nmicroenvironments is highly recommended.  \n\nEpidemiological studies relating pollutant levels in schools and health are in the \n\nearly stages. More studies are necessary to establish unequivocal causal relationships in \n\norder to revise air quality standards and to adopt cost effective mitigation actions. On the \n\nother hand, pollutants have been observed to work in a synergistic fashion as two or more \n\nsubstances may have a combined effect. The multiplicative effects consequently make the \n\ncausation of many cases of environmental illness difficult to identify. Thus, this aspect \n\nshould be addressed in further studies by multidisciplinary teams.  \n\nSource contributions to PM have been modelled for outdoor air pollution. However, \n\nan understanding of the relative contributions from important pollutant sources to indoor \n\nexposures is necessary for the design and implementation of effective control strategies for \n\nIAQ. Detailed emissions profiles have been used in receptor modelling, such as the \n\nChemical Mass Balance (CMB), to apportion the contribution of outdoor sources to \n\nparticulate matter. The complete inexistence of indoor source profiles invalidates the \n\napplication of such models to accurately assign the different emission inputs to interior \n\nspaces. Thus, the detailed chemical characterisation of emissions from indoor \n\nsources/activities should be target in future investigations. Using source apportionment \n\n\n\n \n271 \n\ntechniques, epidemiological studies can more clearly examine exposures to indoor sources \n\nand indoor penetration of source-specific components, reduce exposure misclassification, \n\nand improve the characterisation of the relationship between pollutants and health effects."}]}}}
