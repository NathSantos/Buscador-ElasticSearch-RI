Therefore, controlled primary equipment is necessary to process and separate the mixture and treat these currents to the required standards, subsequently transferring them to the terminals and refineries.\nThe first separation stage is located immediately downstream of the production manifold producing the three phases: water, oil and gas. In general, gravity separators are used. They often have internal devices such as: cyclones and baffle plates in the primary separation, demisters in the agglutination process and structured packing in the secondary separation. The main phases separation mechanisms involved are:\n\u2022\tgravity and density difference, settling the heavier fluid;\n\u2022\tinertial separation, where sudden flow speed and direction changes enables the gas to detach from the liquid phase due to its smaller inertia;\n\u2022\toil droplet coalescence, where droplets contact a surface facilitating their coalescence and sedimentation and;\n\u2022\tcentrifugal force, applying density differences between liquid and gas to separate them, usually more efficiently than simple gravitational settling.\nComputational fluid dynamics is increasingly used as a design tool, facilitated by the dramatic boost of computing power and the efficiency of the employed codes. Furthermore, numerical simulation offers cost reductions to build experimental prototypes and testing, as well as detailing device\ninternal hydrodynamics,otherwise impossible to achieve by experimental methods.\nObjectives\nThis study performed a numerical simulation of a gravitational separator internal flow to evaluate the influence of each internal device in the separation efficiency. In this first stage, the cyclone internal flow - located at the vessel entrance known as the primary separation- is investigated. This is where most of the gas separates from the liquid phase, which remains at the bottom of the separator, known as the accumulation section. Here the residence time should be enough to release the remaining gas from the liquid phase. The internal cyclone flow presents rather complex and challenging characteristics such as: streamlines with high curvature, intense force fields, interaction between primary and secondary flows and anisotropic turbulence. A three-dimensional fluid dynamics study is presented of a gas-liquid two-phase flow in a cyclone.\nCyclones\nThe cyclonic separation is based on generating a centrifugal field in a cone-cylinder body, which acts similarly to gravitational separators. However, the former's acceleration intensity is hundreds (or thousands) times greater, promoting a better separation of the different density phases. The internal cyclonic flow is very complex, despite the rather simple mechanical characteristics of these devices. They are nothing more than static tubes, composed of cylindrical and conical parts. The mixture is fed under pressure, tangentially into the cylindrical chamber, which creates a rotational flow inside the cyclone, with fluid moving downwards along its outer wall (external vortex) and moving upwards along its axis (internal vortex). The centrifugal force generated by the external vortex acts on the heavier fluid, carrying it against the cyclone walls in a downward spiral, penetrating the conical section. In this section, oil and water remain in their downward spiral path, leaving the device by its bottom outlet (underflow). The gas phase, less dense, is directed toward the center, and leaves the equipment in a spiral path through the top outlet (overflow), as shown in figure 1.\nTangential\ninlet\tOverflow\nUnerflow\nFigure 1 - Operational principles of a cyclone.\nFigura 1 - Princ\u00edpios operacionais de um ciclone.\nFigura 1 - Principios operacionales de un cicl\u00f3n.\nMathematical modeling\nGeometry\nThe studied base geometry is shown in figure 2. The stream reaches the gravitational separator through a cylindrical pipe and enters the cyclone through a square section, which extends about 300mm beyond the cyclone body to obtain a gradual transition between the cylindrical and square sections. Despite increasing the mesh used in the simulations, this transition has been represented in order to correctly prescribe the cyclone entry profile, which is one of the boundary conditions. The studied cyclone presents a vortex finder that extends for 708mm inside the cyclone body. The overflow prolongs 100mm outside the cyclone body. The mixture feed is made tangentially to the cylindrical chamber. In the current operation conditions, the underflow is submerged.\nFigure 2 - Base geometry.\nFigura 2 - Geometria base.\nFigura 2 - Geometria base.\nMesh\nThe studied base geometry was inserted into a CAE package and a hexahedral mesh, used in the flow solution by the finite volume method, was generated, as illustrated in figure 3. A hexahedral mesh was chosen because it has the element faces aligned with the flow direction, which reduces the numerical errors. The hexahedral mesh also reduces the total number of elements compared with a tetrahedral mesh. The mesh had about 1.1 million elements and was refined in the cyclone walls, vortex finder and the cyclone axis proximities, these being regions of the higher velocity gradients.\nFigure 3 - Hexahedral mesh details.\nFigura 3 - Detalhes de malha hexa\u00e9drica.\nFigura 3 - Detalles de malla hexa\u00e9drica.\nOperating conditions\nThe separator operates at 880kPa at 90\u00b0C. The device operates with three phases (water, oil and gas), with densities of 1.030kg m-3, 916kg m-3 and 5.96kg m-3, respectively. The water and gas viscosities are virtually constant at 0.31 cP and 0.02cP, respectively. To obtain the saturated oil viscosity the following formula was used:\n= \u25a0\u25a0 )N\nA = 10.715(Rs + 100)-0-515\t(1)\nB = 5.44(Rs + 1501\nWhere:\npod = \"dead oil\" viscosity;\ncP = operating temperature; po = saturated oil viscosity; cP = operating conditions;\nRs = dissolved GOR scf/STB.\nTo calculate the amount of existing dissolved gas (GOR) a Flash simulation was performed. The simulated saturated oil viscosity was 48.44cP.\nTwo cases were studied: the first with the maximum oil production (based on 2006 production data) and the second with the maximum water production (based on 2030 estimated production). Initially the liquids were considered a single phase, homogeneous, with their properties weighted by the volume fraction of each liquid (oil and water).\nSet-up\nThe two-phase flow was modeled using an Eulerian approach, in which transport equations are solved for each phase. Both phase densities and viscosities were considered constant, which corresponds to an isothermal approach. The gas phase was considered as the primary phase, continuous, while the liquid phase was considered dispersed, with a relatively large diameter (5mm). The turbulent effects were modeled through a 7 equations model (SSG), based on the transport of the Reynolds Stress Tensor components, chosen for its known capacity to deal with the anisotropy of turbulence. At the cyclone inlet the phases velocity, as well as the liquid volume fraction were prescribed. In the overflow the relative pressure of 0Pa was prescribed, whereas in the underflow the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid column above it was given, since this cyclone works flooded. Finally, at the walls the non-slip condition for both phases was assumed. The domain began with the liquid level expected during normal operation, as shown in figure 4. The initial pressure was similarly configured with the hydrostatic pressure being taken into consideration. The domain was considered stagnated, with null velocities.\nFor the pressure-velocity coupling, the Simple method was used, which is a segregated algorithm based on pressure. For spatial discretization of the momentum equation a second order method (Second Order Upwind) was used, while the Quick method was used to discretize the volumetric fraction equa-\nFigure 4 - Initial liquid volume fraction.\nFigura 4 - Fra\u00e7\u00e3o do volume de l\u00edquido inicial.\nFigura 4 - Fracci\u00f3n del volu-men del l\u00edquido inicial\ntion, which is based on a combination of centered differences and second order difference approximations. First order schemes were used to discretize the turbulent quantities. The time integration is made by a first order implicit Euler method. The convergence criteria used was 5x10-4. The time step used was 10-4s. Throughout the calculation the equations residuals were accompanied, as well as the mean pressure at the inlet and outlet, to ensure convergence at a stationary regime.\nResults\nResults show the phase separation is not provoked by the centrifugal effect, since an internal rotating flow is not established, due to an ineffective inlet design. Based on the lack of this expected centrifugal field for a cyclone, it can be concluded the device does not function as such. As a result, the device efficiency is limited and possibly small droplets will be carried by the gas stream.\nThe gas phase can circumvent the vortex finder and leaves the cyclone through the overflow, as indicated in the gas phase velocity vectors in figure 5. The liquid phase, on the other hand, due to its greater inertia, can not do the same and ends up bumping into the device walls. A liquid film can be clearly seen forming on the cyclone walls as the liquid droplets collide with the walls and its downward movement toward the gas-liquid interface due to gravity, according to figure 6.\nTherefore, changes to the cyclone inlet geometry were proposed to better achieve the cyclone effect to increase the separation efficiency.\nFigure 5 - Gas velocity vectors.\nFigura 5 - Vetores de velocidade de g\u00e1s.\nFigura 5 - Vectores de la velocidad del gas.\nFigure 6 - Liquid volume fraction.\nFigura 6 - Fra\u00e7\u00e3o de volume de l\u00edquido.\nFigura 6 - Fracci\u00f3n del volumen del l\u00edquido\nNew inlet configurations\nTwo new configurations were first proposed and simulated. In both, the inlet area was the same as the cylindrical pipe area. In the first configuration, the rectangular inlet height was the same as the base geometry (508mm) and the width was changed to 399mm to maintain the same circular area. In the second configuration, the rectangular inlet width was reduced to 284.5mm, so the inlet height was changed to 712.4mm. In both cases, the vortex finder extended for 200mm beyond the end of the inlet, shown in figures 7 and 8, together with the mesh used in each case.\nThe simulations set-up was the same as in the base geometry simulations. As illustrated in figures 9 and 10, in both cases liquid flowed out of the cyclone, through the overflow, and the desired centrifugal field was not obtained.\nThus, a third configuration will be tested, in which the entry dimensions will be the same as configuration 2, but the cyclone \"raised\" so that the bottom of the inlet stay aligned with the pipe. In this way the distance between the liquid level and the vortex finder will be greater than in the second configuration according to figure 11.\nFigure 7 - Geometry and mesh - Configuration 1.\nFigura 7 - Geometria e malha - Configura\u00e7\u00e3o 1.\nFigura 7 - Geometr\u00eda y malla - Configuraci\u00f3n 1.\nFigura 8 - Geometry and mesh - Configuration 2.\nFigure 8 - Geometria e malha - Configura\u00e7\u00e3o 2.\nFigura 8 - Geometr\u00eda y malla - Configuration 2.\nFigure 9 - Isosurfaces of liquid volume fraction -Configuration 1.\nFigura 9 - Isosuperf\u00edcies da fra\u00e7\u00e3o de volume do l\u00edquido - Configura\u00e7\u00e3o 1.\nFigura 9 - Isosuperficies de la fraction de volumen del l\u00edquido - Configuration 1.\nFigura 10 - Isosurfaces of liquid volume fraction -Configuration 2.\nFigure 10 - Isosuperf\u00edcies da fra\u00e7\u00e3o de volume do l\u00edquido - Configura\u00e7\u00e3o 2.\nFigura 10 - Isosuperficies de la fraccion de volumen del l\u00edquido - Configuration 2.\nFigure 11 - Configuration 3. | Figura 11 - Configura\u00e7\u00e3o 3. | Figura 11 - Configuration 3.\ncylindrical body. Based on the lack of the desired centrifugal field, as expected for a cyclone, it can be concluded the device does not function as such.\nIt is possible to analyze how the phase separation occurs in the studied device: the gas can leave the cyclone through its upper outlet, while liquid droplets, due its greater inertia, collide with the device walls, forming a liquid film and join the liquid phase present in the bottom of the cyclone, which is flooded during normal operation.\nTherefore, new inlet configurations were proposed and simulated. Using these new inlets, the desired internal cyclone rotational flow could not be obtained, and liquid could be observed leaving the cyclone through the overflow outlet, due to the low pressure field established around it. Thus, a new configuration, with the same dimensions, but with the entry bottom aligned with the pipe, increasing the distance between the liquid level and the vortex breaker, will be simulated.\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\nConclusions\nThe modeling has shown to be promising for the device internal flow simulation. This initial study main conclusion is that phase separation in the base geometry is not caused by the centrifugal effect, as a rotating flow is not established inside the device due to the feed not tangentially striking the\nBibliografia\n\u25a0\tFERZIGER, J.; PERIC, M.
