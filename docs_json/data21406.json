There is a wide range \n\nof options available that provide good results even under unfavorable conditions. However, \n\nall methods have their own strengths and limitations. Measurements in shallow water depths \n\nare inherently complicated, often colliding with minimum working depths of equipment \n\n(e.g. mechanical current meters), or affected by the inevitable interference of boundary \n\nconditions (e.g. reflection of waves of ADCPs). Tracer methods contribute to surpass some of \n\nthese limitations, however they still raise some concerns namely the use of dyes that can \n\ncause environmental concerns.  \n\nThis thesis describes a novel technique for velocity estimation that uses infrared \n\nthermography to estimate mean flow velocity, based on time of travel. The experimental setup \n\nconsists in an IR camera hanged pointing downwards above a flume, continuously recording \n\nthe flow. Several methods are then used to heat the flow and the hot water acts as a heat tracer \n\nthat is visible through thermography. The recorded images can then be analyzed to compute \n\nvelocity. Proof of principle experiments were performed and results are in accordance with \n\nthe results obtained by the use of an ADV, a well-established velocity measurement \n\ntechnique. Other initial tests were also performed to infer about the most efficient procedures. \n\nThis technique also revealed some potential as a flow visualization technique, and \n\nleaves space for future studies and research. The use of thermography technology has \n\nincreased in the last years; it has already been successfully used in hydrology and \n\nhydrogeology and can be a useful technique due to its capacities to monitor temperature \n\ndistribution in shallow flows. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey Words: Infrared Thermography; Thermal/Heat Tracers; Flow Visualization; Velocity \n\nMeasurements; Flow Velocity; Shallow Flows. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for RESUMO \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima iii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nO desenvolvimento de t\u00e9cnicas precisas e vers\u00e1teis de medi\u00e7\u00e3o de velocidade e de caudal \u00e9 \n\ncrucial para as diversas \u00e1reas da hidr\u00e1ulica, hidrologia e recursos h\u00eddricos. Existem in\u00fameras \n\nop\u00e7\u00f5es dispon\u00edveis que proporcionam bons resultados, mesmo quando confrontadas com \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es desfavor\u00e1veis. No entanto, todos os m\u00e9todos apresentam vantagens e limita\u00e7\u00f5es \n\npara diferentes situa\u00e7\u00f5es. Em particular no caso de medi\u00e7\u00f5es em escoamentos em superf\u00edcie \n\nlivre de pequenas profundidades, \u00e9 sempre complicado efectuar medi\u00e7\u00f5es uma vez que a \n\nmaior parte dos equipamentos necessitam de profundidades m\u00ednimas para funcionarem \n\ncorrectamente (e.g. molinetes mec\u00e2nicos) ou, por outro lado, a inevit\u00e1vel interfer\u00eancia \n\ncausada pelas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de fronteira que podem afectar significativamente os resultados \n\n(e.g. reflex\u00e3o de ondas dos ADCPs). Os m\u00e9todos baseados em tra\u00e7adores, apesar de \n\ncontribu\u00edrem para superar algumas dessas limita\u00e7\u00f5es, s\u00e3o ainda bastante pol\u00e9micos como, por \n\nexemplo, no caso dos l\u00edquidos corados e radioactivos que podem facilmente levantar \n\npreocupa\u00e7\u00f5es ambientais. \n\nEsta tese descreve uma t\u00e9cnica inovadora para estimar a velocidade, utilizando a \n\ntermografia por infravermelhos para estimar as velocidades m\u00e9dias de escoamento, com base \n\nno tempo de percurso de tra\u00e7adores t\u00e9rmicos. A instala\u00e7\u00e3o experimental \u00e9 composta por uma \n\nc\u00e2mara termogr\u00e1fica instalada em cima de um canal que monitoriza de forma cont\u00ednua o \n\nescoamento. S\u00e3o utilizados diversos m\u00e9todos para aquecer o fluido escoado, de forma a \n\nutilizar a \u00e1gua quente como tra\u00e7ador t\u00e9rmico. As imagens gravadas podem ent\u00e3o ser \n\nanalisadas com o objectivo de estimar a velocidade de escoamento.

Framework and Motivation \n\nAccurate flow measurements devices and techniques are crucial for the success of most \n\nactivities related to hydraulics and water resources management. Over the last 30 years, \n\nsignificant improvements and developments were accomplished, not only resulting in higher \n\naccuracy and quality of the obtained data, but also with the emergence of powerful new \n\ntechniques with new capabilities and characteristics, benefiting from the great development of \n\ntechnology in other areas of knowledge.  \n\nThe knowledge of velocity profiles are of engineering interest, thus worth of research \n\nfocus. Velocity, and consequently discharge (e.g. velocity-area method), is inherently difficult \n\nto measure. Not only the velocity varies in time, varies in depth and it also varies along the \n\nwidth. In addition, measurement instruments have to deal with problems such as variability of \n\nbed conditions, presence of sediments, accretion and erosion problems, tidal effects, \n\nconfluence of water masses, or even the presence of vegetation or air-entrainment. All of \n\nthese factors contribute for inaccurate measurements and complicate this important task of \n\nquantifying the flow and obtaining these velocity profiles and fields.  \n\nThere are however plenty of options for velocity measurement. Most of the principles \n\nused for pressurized flow measurements can also be applied for open channel flows, naturally \n\nwith the proper adaptions to face the added complexity originated, for example, by stage or \n\ncross-sectional area variations. However, although these methods are accurate for \n\nmeasurements under certain conditions, they all have significant limitations. As an example, \n\nmost instruments can\u2019t operate at shallow depths. \n\nShallow flows, as part of the hydrological cycle, often appear in many natural and \n\nurbanized catchments. Also, with the increasing demands on water resources, shallow flows \n\nhave gained additional importance. For example, shallow flows are the basis for the design of \n\nrainwater harvesting from parking lots or rooftops. The knowledge of shallow flow behavior \n\nis of engineering interest, due to its implications in water quality, water reserves \n\ncharacterization and importance for low-slope hydrology. However, the characterization and \n\nquantification of this kind of flows is not easy to achieve, due to its low depths and inevitable \n\nconflict with minimum working depth of measuring instruments that result in considerable \n\nuncertainty. \n\nIdentically, research works have also been focusing on flow visualization techniques, \n\nthus new and powerful techniques are emerging, and the existing ones are being improved and \n\nused for different applications. These techniques allow obtaining both qualitative and \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of an infrared strobe method for shallow flow 1.

Particle \n\nImage Velocimetry (PIV) is an example of these methods, and allows the quantification of \n\nvelocity fields. \n\nWithin these flow visualization techniques, thermography appears as a relatively new \n\ntechnique concerning its application in water resources, hydraulics and hydrology. It has \n\nhowever considerable potential for remote detection of velocity patterns (e.g. oceans) or for \n\nuses in groundwater or karst hydrology, relying in the detection of natural or artificially \n\ninduced temperature gradients. The increase in the use of this technology in the last few years \n\nis explained by the decrease in the price of thermographic cameras, and by its increasing \n\nportability that eases its use, especially in the field.  \n\n \n\n1.2. Principle \n\nThe present thesis consists in the description, proof of principle and some initial experiments \n\nof an emerging technique for estimation of flow mean velocity. The technique uses \n\ninexpensive infrared thermography for visualization and quantification of the motion of an \n\ninduced heated mass of hot water acting as a thermal tracer.  \n\nThe resulting footages from the thermographic camera are sequences of greyscale \n\nimages (depending on the camera and software used), which are temperature maps where \n\nhigher temperatures are usually represented by brighter colors and lower temperatures by \n\ndarker colors. Thus, the heated mass of water is clearly visible as a bright mass moving \n\ndownstream. By relying on time of travel considerations, the flow velocity can be computed \n\nthrough Equation (1.1), by relating spatial and temporal information from the recorded \n\nimages, as represented in Figure  1.1. \n\n \n\n    \n \n\n     \n          (1.1) \n\n \nFigure ?1.1 - Idealized moving hot water mass. \n\nIdeally, the water should be locally heated along the full stream width, while causing \n\nminimum disturbance to the flow as possible, and as homogeneously as possible. Besides \n\nvelocity estimation, this technique can also be useful as a flow visualization method. It is \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of an infrared strobe method for shallow flow 1.

Thus, it \n\ncan be viewed as a variation of these methods, usually used with dyes or salt solutions, but \n\nusing a heat/thermal tracer instead. Hot water is likely to perform well as a tracer. As hot \n\nwater is still water, most of the characteristics remain approximately the same, thus this tracer \n\nsimilarity with the stream fluid makes it close to an ideal tracer. However, some of these \n\nproperties are known to vary with temperature, such as density or viscosity. As can be easily \n\ncomputed from a temperature-density relation table, water density at 80\u00baC (? = 0.9718 g cm\n-3\n\n) \n\nis only around 2.7% lower than the density at ambient temperature (for 20\u00baC, \n\n? = 0.9982 g cm\n-3\n\n). This difference is most likely not significant for this technique purposes \n\nand the hot water will follow the motion of the flow properly. However, hot water will have \n\ntendency to remain by the top layers, what can actually be an advantage, because it will \n\nenhance surface visualization through the thermographic camera, as it will be described later \n\non this thesis. Nevertheless, Schuetz et al. (2012) in a similar technique applied to wetlands, \n\nadded a salt solution to approximate the densities and reduce this difference. In addition, the \n\nabsence of tracer particle agglomeration is also an advantage, when compared to other tracers \n\n(e.g. dyes, salts). \n\nThe purpose of this thesis is then to present this two dimensional (planar) technique \n\nthat can be useful to surpass some of the most common limitations of conventional velocity \n\nmeasurement methods, namely when dealing with shallow water depths, where most \n\ninstrument can\u00b4t operate because of their limited operating depths. Other important strengths \n\nare the simplicity of the setup, which requires relatively inexpensive technology and little \n\ncalibration, and the fact that no residue is left on the water (heating might have influence, but \n\nonly small volumes are involved). \n\n \n\n1.3.

WATER FLOW MEASUREMENTS \n\n \n\n2.1. Initial Considerations \n\nThe measurement of flow (e.g. discharge, velocity, water depth) has always been crucial for \n\nmany different domains. With the management of water resources being a hot topic of the \n\npresent times, flow measurement must be seen as fundamental for the planning activity. Flow \n\nmeasurement provides information about the availability of water resources and its variability \n\nin time and space, allowing a more integrated approach that can be used to support water \n\nmanagement. Knowing the amount of water available is the most important starting point for \n\ndetermining the best uses for it, reducing the losses and negative environmental impacts. The \n\nplanning activity should start with a deep characterization of the study zone in order to \n\nidentify the problems (diagnosis) and analyze the available alternatives for solving the \n\nproblems and defining the impacts of each of these alternatives. All of these phases depend on \n\nthe quality of the available data, such as flow discharge, and are valuable inputs for methods \n\nof decision making support. \n\nThe multiple demands for water use also require flow measurement to be accurate. \n\nIrrigation systems are the most recurring example in literature for justifying its importance. \n\nProblems like ensuring a proper distribution of the available water to the multiple users or \n\ncrops damaged by overwatering are often referred. Also in the water distribution systems, \n\nflow measurement is fundamental, with proper water losses assessment and water billing \n\nbeing the key point. Many other activities rely on these measurements for its operation such \n\nas hydroelectric power generation or industry. It\u2019s also important to emphasize the \n\nimplications it can have in the cost. \n\nAlso in flood control, flow measurements are the basis for the prediction of water \n\nlevels and storm water runoff monitoring, allowing the implementation of measures to \n\nminimize the impacts of floods.  \n\nDesign of hydraulic structures such as channels, water storage reservoirs, dams, flood \n\ncontrol structures, can\u2019t be effectively accomplished without quantifying the discharge that \n\nthe structure needs to be able to handle.  \n\nFinally, with the recent environmental concerns, quality control of water resources has \n\nbecome a priority, with considerable pollution control efforts being made. For example, \n\nindustrial wastewaters are now required to comply with regulations limits, and the polluter-\n\npayer principle is being applied. All these environmental measures depend on measuring the \n\ndischarge and analyzing its chemical properties, in order to quantify their pollution indicators. \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 6 \n\n \n\nBesides the importance of knowing discharge, the knowledge of velocity is also vital \n\nfor many studies. For example, soil erosion is a function of flow velocity, meaning that it \n\nmust be known to allow the calibration of models for its quantification. Similarly, velocity is \n\nalso fundamental in pollutant transport and dispersion modeling. \n\nIn addition, flow discharge and velocity undoubtedly influence aquatic organism \n\nenergy expenditure, food delivery, waste removal, predator avoidance, and disturbance. Thus, \n\ntheir measurement is important for its analysis and environmental studies (Hart, 1999).  \n\nThe research process, in order to obtain valid results, needs accurate data to be \n\nanalyzed. Flow discharge and velocity fields are examples of crucial data for researching \n\nwater related issues.  For example, (Biron et al., 2004) emphasize the need for accurate flow \n\nfield data (discharge, velocity, boundary conditions) for parameterization, calibration, and \n\nvalidation of their developed one-, two-, and three-dimensional river models.  \n\nAll of these aspects contributed to the development of flow measurement techniques \n\nalong the years. In the last few years, new techniques are becoming more popular while others \n\nthat were massively used in the past are getting obsoletes due to the development of new and \n\nmore effective techniques.  \n\n \n\n2.2. Shallow Flows \n\nShallow flows are flows where the water depth is significantly smaller than the width (width \n\nto depth ratio is significantly bigger than 1). This type of flow is known for being turbulent \n\n(Uijttewaal et al., 2001).  \n\nShallow flows are quite common and they can be observed in many different \n\nsituations such as in lakes, estuaries, stratified water bodies, coastal areas, lowland rivers, \n\noverland flows or urban areas (Jirka &amp; Uijttewaal, 2004). The determination of velocity fields \n\nin shallow flows is crucial for the success of soil erosion, river morphology or contaminant \n\ntransport models, since it\u2019s one of their most important input parameters. Velocity in shallow \n\nflows is affected by several factors, including channel slope or roughness.  \n\nComputers already have capacity to solve 3D models for this kind of flow \n\n(Vreugdenhil, 1994). For example, commercial fluid dynamics simulation software \n\n(e.g. FLOW-3D, OpenFoam, Fluent) can be used to model three-dimensional flows with free \n\nsurfaces and complex channel geometry (Hirt &amp; Richardson, 1999). However, attending to the \n\nfact that the processes in the horizontal plane are clearly dominant, 3D interactions are often \n\nneglected and shallow flows are analyzed through simplified 2D models that still provide \n\ngood approximations. \n\nShallow flows can be difficult to measure using conventional methods, mostly due to \n\nminimum working depths of measuring devices, vegetation interference, sand deposition or \n\ntemporal and spatial changes. In the laboratory, volumetric methods (see section  2.4.1) are \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 7 \n\n \n\nwidely used, but they are unsuitable for field measurements, where tracer methods (section \n\n 2.5.9) are one of the best options for its measurement. \n\n \n\n2.3. Techniques for Open Channel Flows \n\nThere are plenty of options for discharge and velocity measurements in open channel flows. \n\nDifferent authors have been grouping them differently (Holman, 2001). In the present thesis, \n\ndischarge measurements were separated from velocity measurements, although they are \n\nrelated. Other grouping options could consider, for example, single or continuous \n\nmeasurements, accuracy or applicability (field or laboratory). \n\nThe selection between the multiple existing measurement instruments and techniques \n\nis made accounting for many variables related to the equipment itself (e.g. cost, installation \n\nprocess, portability, availability of power source, dimensions, software) or for the goal of the \n\nmeasurement (e.g. single or continuous measurement required, precision/accuracy needed, \n\nhydraulic conditions). For example, if the objective is to calibrate one specific method, we \n\nmight not need an expensive accurate method with continuous record of flow. Also, there are \n\nmany constraints and limitations (e.g. depth, accessibility) that will lead to choosing a method \n\nover the others. \n\nTo summarize, the determination of discharge and/or velocity is not an easy task. For \n\neach case, the most suitable method should be used, and the user should be aware of its \n\nuncertainties and limitations. The following sub-sections give an overview of the available \n\ntechniques, referring its basic principle as well as their main advantages and limitations, \n\nespecially when applied to shallow flows. \n\n \n\n2.4. Discharge Measurements  \n\nThere are several ways to measure discharge. Some of the techniques give discharge directly \n\n(e.g. volumetric and gravimetric). However, discharge is often obtained indirectly, by \n\nmeasuring different components separately (e.g. velocity, stage, and channel geometry). \n\nIn control section methods (e.g. weirs, flumes), discharge can be computed from the upstream \n\nstage, while in the Area-Velocity method (section  2.4.4) velocity measurements are used for \n\nthe same purpose. In both cases, the use of secondary instruments is required, for the \n\nknowledge of water levels and cross sectional geometry, respectively. \n\n \n\n2.4.1. Gravimetric and Volumetric Methods \n\nThe principle of both methods is simple: it consists in collecting the entire flow in a reservoir \n\nand compute discharge by dividing the quantity of water collected by the corresponding \n\nperiod of time. \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 8 \n\n \n\n \n\nIn the gravimetric method, this can be done by weighting the amount of water \n\ncollected during a given time period. Similarly, the volumetric method follows the same \n\nprinciple, although measurements involve measuring the volume of collected fluid instead. \n\nDue to the nature of the measurements, this option is less accurate than the gravimetric one, \n\ndespite not requiring a weighing scale (a reservoir with a known volume is enough), what can \n\nbe an advantage in field measurements.  \n\nThese method have some evident limitations since they can\u00b4t identify changes in the \n\nflow rate and it can\u2019t be used for continuous measurements (the computed discharge is an \n\naverage flow rate during a given time period). Another significant limitation is that it can only \n\nbe used for low discharge values and for narrow stream concentrated flows. It is, however, a \n\nuseful technique for small and simple field and laboratory measurements (Grant &amp; Dawson, \n\n1995). With accuracy values that can reach \u00b10.04%, gravimetric methods are probably the \n\nmost reliable option for discharge measurements, and are often used as reference values in \n\nlaboratories. (LEHid/LNEC, 2008) \n\n \n\n2.4.2. Natural and Artificial Control Sections and Hydraulic Structures  \n\nThe goal of a control section is to maintain a flow with well-defined characteristics (critical \n\nflow). An ideal control section varies neither in space nor in time. These control sections can \n\nbe natural or artificial, as long as they are stable in order for the rating curves (discharge \n\nversus stage graph) to remain valid. When weirs or flumes are built, they induce changes in \n\nwater level in the nearby region. Under these critical conditions, discharge can be computed \n\nonly from the upstream stage (downstream head has no influence), since there is a unique \n\nwater level for each value of discharge. For artificial control sections, the relation between \n\nstage and discharge is well known, so tabulated ratings can be used (Grant &amp; Dawson, 1995). \n\nFlow measurement through this method requires auxiliary methods for stage determination, \n\noften referred as secondary methods. \n\nWeirs are hydraulic structures (Figure  2.1a) where an obstruction to the flow is applied \n\nin order to obligate the water to flow though the opening (notch). Weirs are often classified by \n\nthe shape of the notch that can be rectangular, V shaped (V-notch) or trapezoidal (Cipolletti). \n\nFlumes can be described as an artificially shaped channel flow section (Figure  2.1b), \n\nwhere the area and slope are modified, forcing the flow to acquire critical conditions, \n\nresulting in changes in velocity and stage. This is usually obtained by a contraction of the \n\nsection (vertical and horizontal), restricting the flow, followed by expansion to the normal \n\nchannel width. The most common flumes are Parshall flumes, ramp flumes and trapezoidal \n\nflumes (Bos, 1985). \n\nSubmerged orifices can also be used for flow measurement in open channels. An \n\norifice is a well-defined, sharp-edged opening in a wall, through which flow occurs. \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 9 \n\n \n\nDischarge can be computed from the variation between upstream and downstream head and \n\nfrom the characteristics of the orifice. Submerged orifices result in less head loss when \n\ncompared to weirs. However, they have more problems with the deposit of sediments and \n\nother objects that may cause obstruction of the orifice. They\u2019re usually installed when the \n\nconditions for building a weir or a flume are not adequate. (USBR &amp; USDA, 2001) \n\n \n\nThe main limitation of these control section methods is that they require building a structure \n\nwhich, sometimes, it\u2019s neither possible nor desirable. Besides, unstable bed conditions, ice \n\nand vegetation obstruction may reduce accuracy. Thus, regular maintenance is crucial to \n\nensure data quality. It is also an intrusive method which changes the conditions of the flow by \n\nplacing an obstruction to the flow.  \n\n \n\n \n\n   \nFigure ?2.1 - Example of hydraulic structures for flow measurements: a) sharp crested weir (Geocashing, 2013); \n\nb) flume (Clearfield County, 2013). \n\n \n\n2.4.3. Empirical Formulas (Slope-Area Method - Control Channel) \n\nFlow can also be estimated using empirical formulas and coefficients. For example, the \n\nGauckler\u2013Manning\u2013Strickler formula can be used to compute discharge or velocity, based on \n\nsome parameters such as the cross sectional area of flow, hydraulic radius, average slope, and \n\nthe coefficient of roughness. However, this method implies the use of auxiliary methods to \n\ndetermine the referred parameters (Boiten, 2000). \n\nManning roughness coefficients have been tabulated for many different conditions and \n\nmaterials. Its determination has been object of many research studies. Nevertheless, this \n\ncoefficient actually involves parameters such as surface friction or wave resistance that \n\noriginate uncertainties. Therefore, its determination is difficult for densely vegetated zones, \n\nshallow flows, or in alluvial channels with continuously changing bed forms, whose \n\ncomplexity of processes complicate this task. Ding et al. (2004) presented a numerical method \n\nbased on optimal theories for identifying Manning roughness coefficients in shallow water \n\nflows, that emphasizes the difficulties that can be found when applying this method, under \n\na) b) \n\nhttp://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=df052868-211e-4cc7-a112-665b9c230359\nhttp://www.ettaro.com/subdomains/amd/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8&amp;Itemid=121\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2.

Furthermore, the application of these formulas can be seen as a control \n\nchannel method, which implies the existence of an uniform flow. Therefore, in order to \n\nsuccessfully apply the Manning formula, some hydraulic and geometric conditions must be \n\nfulfilled. \n\nSimilarly, other formulas can be used, such as Ch\u00e9zy\u2019s formula that considers mean \n\nvelocity as a function of the hydraulic radius, the bottom slope and the Ch\u00e9zy coefficient \n\n(e.g Dalrymple &amp; Benson, 1984; Hershy, 1995). \n\n \n\n2.4.4. Area-Velocity Method \n\nThe Area-Velocity method uses the continuity equation to compute discharge from the \n\ngeometry of the cross section and from the mean velocity in this same section. In order to \n\ncompute these quantities, the cross section is divided into several subsections \n\n(Ardiclioglu et al., 2010). The geometry is obtained by performing stage measurements in \n\neach one of them (depth at the middle of the subsection). Mean velocity is obtained from \n\nsingle point velocity measurements at different verticals and depths along the width of the \n\nstream. However, the adoption of a mean velocity to describe the velocity in the cross section \n\nis a considerable simplification. The distribution of the velocity of the cross section is non-\n\nuniform and exhibits considerable variation both through the depth and width, as represented \n\nin Figure  2.2. Vertical profiles have a parabolic distribution of velocity, with the point of \n\nmaximum velocity occurring around 10% of total depth below the surface. Horizontally, the \n\nmaximum velocity occurs in the center of the channel, decreasing as it approaches the edges.  \n\n \n\na)        b) \n\n        \nFigure ?2.2 - Velocity variations in the cross section (Rantz, 1982): a) typical vertical velocity profile obtained by \n\nan ADCP; b) schematic of the velocity variation in the cross section. \n\n \n\nIn order to properly describe velocity fields, different readings at different depths and \n\nat different verticals along the width of the stream are necessary. Ideally, mean velocity would \n\nhttp://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2006/5226/\nhttp://www.jland.org/swat/e41/lab4/\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 11 \n\n \n\nbe computed from the integration of velocity profiles. As a simplification, there are several \n\nmethods to establish the relationship between these readings and the mean velocity at each \n\nsubsection, such as the vertical velocity curve method, the two point method, or the six tenths \n\ndepth method (Buchanan &amp; Somers, 1969). These methods may require a variable number of \n\nreadings, feature different accuracy, and be more suitable for distinct situations (depth, \n\nvertical variations in water speed, equipment used). These methods are crucial to properly \n\nestimate the mean velocity of the non-uniform vertical velocity field of open channel flow. \n\nThe accuracy of the method increases with the number of subsections studied and with \n\nthe number of measurements in each vertical. It\u2019s also important to ensure that the main flow \n\ndirection is perpendicular to the cross section, thus the selection of the measuring site and \n\nsection is important for the success of the method. \n\nMeasurements may require various pieces of equipment (e.g. cablecars for \n\ntransportation of the operators, unmanned cableways, bridgeboards, cranes for measurements \n\nfrom bridges) (Hershy, 1995). The need for extra equipment increases the cost of the \n\nmeasurements and complicates the execution. \n\n \n\n2.5. Velocity Measurements  \n\nVelocity measurement techniques can measure velocity locally (single direction, or 3D), or \n\ncan measure the mean velocity directly. There are also methods that can swipe the full depth \n\n(and width) and obtain the velocity profile (e.g. ADCP or current meters together with a boat). \n\nFinally, some methods allow to measure the velocity continuously, while others can\u2019t \n\nconsider the time variable, thus disregarding variations of velocity with time. \n\n \n\n2.5.1. Force Displacement  \n\nForce displacement methods are based in the principle that the strength of the water against a \n\nmass is proportional to flow velocity.  \n\nAn example of these methods is a deflection meter, where a vane (vertical or \n\nhorizontal axis) is hanged into the flow and its deflection is measured. Vanes can also be used \n\nto directly obtain the discharge (e.g. Larsen, 1992, USBR &amp; USDA, 2001). For this purpose, \n\nvanes have to be calibrated and shaped accordingly to the geometry of the channel. Although \n\nvanes are expensive, they can be used in multiple sites by installing them in permanent pivots \n\nthat are usually built to support the removable vanes. Similarly to traditional current meters, \n\nvane deflection meters should not be used if the flow contains considerable amounts of solids \n\nand sediments because it might damage the equipment.  \n\nPendulum type meters are another good example of force displacement methods \n\n(Boiten, 2000). In this case, a submerged mass is hanged by a wire (similar to a pendulum) \n\nand flow velocity can be estimated by measuring the angle of displacement of the wire. \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 12 \n\n \n\nDepending on flow velocities, masses of different shapes and materials are available. \n\nCoefficients may be necessary for corrections for the bending of the wire. This technique is \n\nuseful for measurements in shallow rivers or channels.  \n\nThe effect of wind in the exposed part of both the vane and the wire from the \n\npendulum can originate significant errors, which can, however, be minimized by installing a \n\nwindbreak system.  \n\n \n\n2.5.2. Velocity Head Rod \n\nThis simple and inexpensive technique uses the proportionality between flow velocity and the \n\nupstream height increase (jump) caused by the insertion of a graduated rod in the water \n\n(Boiten, 2000). First, with the sharper edge pointed upstream, the stream depth is measured. \n\nThe rod is then placed sideways to the flow, originating an obstacle that causes disturbance \n\nupstream of the rod, namely a jump. By measuring the depth for these new conditions, the \n\nheight of the induced jump can be computed and used in tables or abacuses that provide the \n\ncorresponding velocity (Carufel, 1980).  \n\nThis technique is useful for casual measurements in small streams and works well in \n\nthe presence of debris or vegetation. It has some limitations, namely the difficulty of detecting \n\ndepth variation for slow velocities or in holding the rod against the flow \n\n(Fonstad et al., 2005). \n\n \n\n2.5.3. Anemometry \n\n \n\nHot Wire Anemometers \n\nThis method\u2019s basic principle consists in relating the fluid velocity to the heat lost when \n\nplacing a heated wire in contact with the moving flow. The transfer of heat to the surrounding \n\nfluid can be measured by monitoring the energy needed to maintain a constant temperature in \n\nthe wire. Different kind of probes can be used, and they are chosen taking into consideration \n\nmany factors, such as the type of flow to be measured, medium (e.g. water, air; widely used \n\nfor measuring wind velocities) or the expected velocity range. Some examples of probes are \n\nwires, fiber, films or arrays (J\u00f8rgensen, 2002). This technique requires computational analysis \n\nand calibration. Because the sensors are fragile, this technique can\u2019t be used under aggressive \n\nconditions (e.g. presence of debris or sediments).  \n\nThis technique only provides a measure of the turbulence within the flow. Thus, its \n\naim is different of the other techniques here presented and it is only here described to \n\nemphasize this difference. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 13 \n\n \n\nLaser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV) \n\nLaser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), also known as Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) is a \n\nwell-established optical method for single point velocity measurements (Drain, 1980). \n\nSimilarly to other methods, the flow has to be seeded with particles prior to the experiments. \n\nThe method involves the use of two continuous laser beams converging at one point (Albrecht \n\net al., 2003). When tracer particles pass through that point, they reflect the incident light back \n\nto the optical system. By collecting this scattered reflected light (backscatter) and analyzing \n\nits Doppler shift in wavelength it\u2019s possible to obtain the local 3 different components of \n\nvelocity.  \n\n \n\n2.5.4. Mechanical Current Meters \n\nCurrent meters are devices to locally measure the velocity of flow (Figure  2.3). The water \n\nmovement induces the rotation of a small rotor that can be installed on a vertical or horizontal \n\naxis. The velocity of the water can be computed from its proportionality with the angular \n\nvelocity of the rotor (Boiten, 2000).  \n\nThe use of current meters has some limitations or drawbacks (Hershy, 1995). \n\nDepending on the depth and width of the channel we intend to measure, the application of this \n\nmethod may take a long time (pulsating flow requires each single reading to last for at least \n\n40seconds in order to minimize errors. Taking a long time to obtain the readings can be a \n\nproblem, especially if rapid changes in stage are expected, jeopardizing the results. Current \n\nmeters have also minimum working water depths that can be an important limitation if \n\nshallow flows are to be measured. For this type of flow, pygmy meters are the best option, \n\nwith minimum working depths of around 9.14 cm. Besides, current meters don\u2019t work for \n\nflows that are too slow. For example, a pygmy meter needs velocities over 1.83 cm/s in order \n\nto be able to detect it. The presence of debris and sediments also restricts the use of current \n\nmeters, since it may damage them. \n\n \n\n \nFigure ?2.3 - Example of current meters: a) pygmy-price (Gurley Precision Instruments); b) propeller type \n\n(Hydro-Bios; c) propeller type (Scottech). \n\n \n\nb) c) a) \n\nhttp://www.hydrobios.de/en/products/flow-and-current-meters/rod-held-current-meter-rhcm\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 14 \n\n \n\nAnother relevant outlook is that current meters must be kept in good conditions, which \n\nrequire effective maintenance. Without it, the current meter rating (table relating velocity of \n\nthe rotor with flow velocity) will most likely provide incorrect values for local velocity. \n\nMany other aspects are susceptible of reducing the instrument accuracy such as the \n\ninterference caused by the operator legs while using the current meter or even the influence of \n\nvertical walls proximity. In order to obtain the best possible results, the choice of a good \n\nmeasuring site is fundamental. It should comply with some criteria, which include the flow \n\nbeing as rectilinear and regular as possible (flow predominately in a single plane), the use of a \n\nstable cross section. Otherwise, velocity vectors with different directions (e.g. downwards or \n\nsideways) may cause the meters to spin faster and compromise results (Rantz, 1982). \n\nTo sum up, the application of this method should be done carefully, because otherwise, its \n\nresults may be erroneous. \n\n \n\n2.5.5. Electromagnetic \n\nAccording to electromagnetic induction principle (Faraday), when water flows through a \n\nmagnetic field it generates a voltage. The magnitude of this induced voltage can be used to \n\ncompute the average velocity of the flow.  \n\nBased in this principle, electromagnetic flow sensors (e.g. Boiten, 2000; Aqua-Data, \n\n2013) comprise a probe equipped with electrodes that sense the voltage induced by the \n\nmoving water (Figure  2.4b). These probes have no moving parts and don\u2019t require calibration \n\n(after manufacturer). These devices feature high sensitivity and accuracy, making it a very \n\nversatile instrument that is suitable for measurements in several unfavorable conditions \n\nincluding shallow or low velocity flows. Although these meters require a minimum \n\nconductivity of the medium (5 ?S), this is usually not a problem for uses with water (clean \n\nfresh water conductivity around 50 ?S). It is also unaffected by debris or suspended solids in \n\nthe flow. Its portability and ease to use are also advantages of this technique. \n\nNewman (1982) developed a large scale application of this electromagnetic method \n\nfor measurements in a rivers (Figure  2.4a). In order to create the magnetic field, an \n\nelectromagnetic coil is buried under the river bed, and the voltage is picked up by electrodes \n\nin the stream banks. Depending on the bed properties (e.g. conductivity), the induced potential \n\nmay be significantly attenuated. To solve this problem, a membrane can be used to isolate the \n\nflow from the river bed, however implying an increase of the cost of the technique (material \n\nand installation). The application range of this method is one of its most important \n\nadvantages, since it allows surpassing most common flow measurement limitations: there are \n\nno problems with vegetation, debris content, temperature stratification or variations in stage. \n\nBesides, despite the need to build a permanent installation, the resulting gauging station does \n\nnot change the flow conditions (stage) nor becomes a barrier for fish. This method is mainly \n\nused in channels with widths up to 25meters. Despite the usefulness of this technique, \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2.

Acoustic Devices \n\n \n\nUltrasonic (Transit Time Acoustic Meter) \n\nThis method uses ultrasonic signals to measure flow velocity. Transducers are placed in the \n\nwater stream and transmit timed pulses to the opposite transducer (or reflector) (e.g. Newman \n\n1982; Boiten, 2000). Since the transducers are placed with an angle relatively to the direction \n\nof the flow, the transit time of the signals between transducers varies due to the influence of \n\nthe moving water mass. These variations in transit times can then be processed to compute \n\nflow velocity. \n\nThis technique offers better results for channel widths larger than 25 meters. It may, \n\nhowever, evidence problems with signal paths closer to the surface or to the stream bed due to \n\ninterference caused by signals reflected by boundaries, not being well suited for shallow \n\nflows. Temperature stratification may cause the beams to bend and not to reach the \n\ncorresponding transducer. This can be explained by the dependence of speed of sound on \n\nwater temperature. Same beam bending can occur in estuarine waters or confluences where \n\nwater mixing causes signal reflections. Besides, in these crossed flows, the direction of flow \n\nmight not be easy to determine. This has implications in the final result, since the angle \n\nbetween the signal path and the flow is used for computations. For these reasons, the site \n\nselection gains crucial importance for the success of this method. \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 16 \n\n \n\nAcoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)  \n\nThe Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) technology uses the Doppler Effect to \n\ncompute the velocity profile of a stream (Grant &amp; Dawson, 1995). The Doppler Effect \n\nprinciple states that, as a result of relative motion between the source and the observer, there \n\nis a change in the apparent frequency of the wave. The ADCP device comprises four \n\ntransducers (Figure  2.5a) that transmit high frequency sound waves (acoustic pings) that are \n\nreflected by moving particles or air bubbles from the flow. Due to the Doppler Effect, these \n\nreflected waves are collected again by the same ADCP with a different frequency values, \n\nallowing to compute the relative velocity between the moving particles (assumed to be the \n\nsame as the flow velocity) and the ADCP equipment (fixed or also in motion). Three of these \n\ntransducers are used to compute the velocity in 3 dimensions, while the 4\nth\n\n transducer is \n\nmainly used for error corrections (Rantz, 1982). \n\nADCP is a current profiler, meaning that velocity is not measured locally, but a profile \n\nis obtained instead. This data can be used to compute discharge by integrating the velocity \n\nprofiles for the full cross section (e.g. area-velocity method). For this purpose, ADCPs are \n\nusually installed in a moving boat in order to swipe the entire cross section of the stream \n\n(Figure  2.5b). The emitted sound signals can be used simultaneously to measure the stage by \n\ntime of travel principle. In addition, ADCP devices are also equipped with a pendulum and a \n\ngyroscope that allows them to measure their own speed, in relation to a fixed point in the \n\nstream bed (explains the reduced accuracy of this method when movable beds occur). \n\nHowever, there are regions of the cross section that can\u00b4t be measured. Close to the surface, \n\nthere is a region called blanking distance (length for submerging the ADCP device plus the \n\nlength transducers need to detect the signals). Near the bottom of the cross section and in \n\nregions close to the shore or vertical walls there is also lot of interference with rebounding \n\nwaves (side lobe interference). Because only part of the cross section is measured and to \n\navoid underestimation of discharge, the missing velocities have to be estimated based on an \n\nidealized velocity distribution, which introduces uncertainty (Rantz, 1982). \n\nIn order to detect the reflected sound waves, there must be particles in the water. \n\nHowever, air bubbles originated by the turbulence of the water flow are usually enough for \n\nthis purpose. Because of interference caused by reflections from the boundaries (e.g. surface \n\nand bed), this technique only allows working depths over 0.5m (Forray, 1998).  \n\nThis method can provide accurate and quick results, which are useful when measuring \n\nrapidly changing flows (e.g. tides), surpassing the traditional time consuming current meters \n\nmeasurements.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2.

This variation is called H-ADCP and has \n\nprovided reliable results under specific conditions (Coz, 2008). \n\n \n\nAcoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) \n\nAcoustic Doppler Velocimetry (ADV) technology also uses the Doppler Effect to calculate \n\nthe velocity, but it only provides single point three dimensional velocity \n\n(Chanson et al., 2008). \n\nThe ADV device is usually composed of three different elements: the conditioning \n\nmodule, the probe and the processor (Figure  2.6). The first one is a cylindrical module \n\nmounted vertically, with a down-looking sensor at one of its extremities. The second one is a \n\nprobe that is connected to the conditioning module.

However the \n\nmain advantages referred are its simple maintenance, no need for frequent calibration, and \n\nhigh accuracy results. \n\nBoth the acoustic Doppler methods (ADCP and ADV) have become important options \n\nfor routine measurements, due to its safety, speed of measurements, simpleness of installation \n\nand relatively low cost (Morlock &amp; Fisher, 2002). \n\n \n\n2.5.7. Surface Velocity \n\n \n\nRadar Instruments \n\nIn this method, a radar sends signals and collects its reflections from particles and roughness \n\nof the surface of the stream (Costa et al., 2000). Similarly to the ADCP method (section \n\n 2.5.6), software analyzes the shifts in frequency (Doppler Effect) and computes a value for the \n\nsurface velocity. The process of obtaining discharge from the superficial velocity resembles \n\nwith the optical method described above.  \n\nIt\u2019s a non-intrusive method, meaning that it surpasses many of the most common \n\nlimitations of flow measurement techniques (e.g. debris). Wind might cause interference in \n\nthe surface of the flow. This can be corrected by measuring the wind speed, but at some point \n\nit will preclude its use. Nevertheless, it has been proven to be a valid, safe and useful \n\ntechnique for flow measurement. \n\n \n\nOptical  \n\nThis method measures the surface velocity without submerging the equipment \n\n(e.g. Rantz, 1982; Kirkpatrick &amp; Shelley, 1975). The flow is observed from above from a \n\nstroboscopic device, usually from a bridge, and the motor speed is adjusted in order to obtain \n\nsynchronization of the angular velocity of the mirror with the water surface movement. This is \n\nachieved when there is no apparent motion of the water surface, when observed through the \n\noptical meter. The information obtained from the tachometer is then used to estimate the \n\nsurface velocity of the flow.  \n\nWhen computing discharge, the area-velocity method is used. The surface velocities \n\nare converted to mean velocities, usually by considering the mean velocity equal to 80% or \n\n85% of the superficial velocity. This procedure is not precise, introducing inevitable \n\nuncertainties to the results.  \n\nOptical meters, as many others non-contact methods, can be useful when traditional \n\ncurrent meters are impossible to use, for example during floods, which originates high flow \n\nvelocities and considerable quantities of sediments. However, since it computes velocity \n\nbased on surface monitoring, it\u2019s highly incompatible with wind.  \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 19 \n\n \n\nSeveral other different kinds of optical methods are available, and will be overviewed \n\nin section  3, dedicated to flow visualization. \n\n \n\n2.5.8. Floats/Drift Tracers \n\nThe concept of measuring velocity using floats is quite simple (Figure  2.7). It consists in \n\nplacing a floating object in the water and measuring the time it takes between two selected \n\ncross sections (Hershy, 1995). The float should acquire a constant velocity before starting the \n\nmeasurement and a travel time of at least 20 seconds between the two checkpoints is \n\nrecommended. Floats of many different sizes and shapes can be used. Oranges are commonly \n\nreferred as an example of the versatility of this method and its usefulness for emergencies \n\nwhen no other method is available. Also bottles, or longer rods and tubes can be used to reach \n\ndeeper zones, in order to the velocity of the floats to be closer to the mean velocity of the \n\nflow. For wider streams, multiple floats should be used alongside.  \n\nDischarge can be obtained by converting surface velocity into mean velocity, using a \n\nconversion coefficient (e.g. USBR &amp; USDA, 2001; Rantz, 1982). Therefore, because of the \n\nlack of preciseness of this coefficient, along with the probable experimental errors or the \n\ninfluence of wind (more significant for lower velocities), the obtained values aren\u00b4t very \n\naccurate, which makes this method not suitable for routine data collection. \n\n \n\na)             b) \n\n \nFigure ?2.7 - Float measurements: a) procedure illustration (Sanders., 1998); b) different types of floats (Boiten, \n\n2000). \n\n \n\n2.5.9. Tracer Methods  \n\nThis technique consists in injecting a substance into the water flow, generally referred as \n\n\u201ctracer\u201d, and in measuring its movement. Thus, it\u2019s an indirect method (the tracer movement \n\nis measured, instead of the flow itself) that relies on the assumption that the motion of the \n\ntracer is exactly the same as the movement of the fluid.  \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2. WATER FLOW MEASUREMENT \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 20 \n\n \n\nThere are two different approaches in this tracer technique: tracer-time-of-travel and \n\ntracer-dilution. The first one is based on the tracer time of travel and the second one is based \n\non the degree of dilution observed. \n\nWhen the tracer is added to the flow, it starts dispersing in all three directions. \n\nAn initial mixing period ends when full mixing is complete for the vertical and lateral \n\ndirections. Then, the longitudinal mixing goes on indefinitely, because it is not restrained. \n\nFull lateral and vertical mixing is crucial, especially for the success of the tracer-dilution \n\nvariation (Hubbard et al., 1982). \n\nTracer methods provide information about mean velocity (tracer velocity) or discharge \n\n(tracer dilution). It\u2019s however impossible to infer about vertical velocity profile with this \n\ntechnique. Nonetheless, this is not a constraint when dealing with shallow flows, making this \n\ntechnique a powerful way to surpass most difficulties when measuring this kind of flow. \n\nRecent development of stable fluorescent dyes and more advanced fluorometers that \n\ncan detect chemicals in very low concentrations helped increase the importance and accuracy \n\nof this technique (Tauro et al., 2012). Therefore, if performed properly by following all the \n\nrecommendations and procedures available (e.g. USGS recommendations), it can provide \n\nvery accurate and reliable results. It highly depends on the equipment used and experience of \n\nthe operator. It can be a very useful method, especially under conditions where other \n\ntechniques are not appropriate (e.g. low water depths, debris that damage equipment, \n\nexcessive turbulence, inaccessible flow, unsteady flow, etc.). Tracers also have the advantage \n\nof not obstructing the flow, thus not causing head loss. \n\n \n\nTracer Types and Desirable Characteristics \n\nThere are many available types of tracers that can be used, each one of them with its own \n\ncharacteristics and, consequently, different advantages and disadvantages. The used tracer \n\nshould be wisely chosen from the available options, which can be limited by many \n\nconstraints, such as price, readiness of use, environmental impacts or quality of visualization.  \n\n \n\nAn \u201cideal\u201d tracer has the following characteristics: \n\n? Availability and environment \n\no Inexpensive \n\no Harmless \n\no Low toxicity \n\n?

Photochemical decay  \n\no Low adsorption and absorption (minimize tracer loss) \n\no Density similar to water \n\no High water solubility \n\no Low agglomeration (compromises assumption of following the flow) \n\n \n\nIn brief, a tracer should blend perfectly into the flow, accurately replicating its \n\nmovement, while allowing proper visualization and quantification, without any limitations to \n\nits applicability (e.g. price, pollution, etc.). Although there are no ideal tracers, this technique \n\ncan still be used with quite good results, if the proper tracer for the objective and nature of the \n\nexperiment is selected (Mei, 1996). \n\nThe quantity of tracer to be used depends on discharge, downstream distance to the \n\nmeasuring site or expected loss of tracer. There are formulas, especially for long distance \n\ntravel time measurements, for determining the quantity of tracer that has to be added to the \n\nflow (Hubbard et al., 1982). There must be a balance between adding enough tracer to allow \n\nproper visualization and, on the contrary, not to add tracer in excess that might change the \n\nflow characteristics. \n\nThere are many types of tracers which include electrolyte tracers (e.g. salt solutions), \n\ndye, magnetized tracers or radioactive tracers. The latter one isn\u2019t used very often, due to \n\ncomplications with the handling of radioactive materials. Several other tracers have been used \n\nand experimented with, often for qualitative and flow visualization purposes (section  3), \n\ninstead of directly for flow velocity measurements, such as the hydrogen bubble (section \n\n 3.2.2) or the thymol blue technique (section  3.2.3).  \n\nDespite sharing the same principle, each tracer has its own characteristics and requires \n\ndifferent equipment and methods for its detection. \n\nDye tracers can be tracked visually (only in the tracer velocity method) or alternatively \n\nby using a fluorometer, which improves accuracy. There are plenty of options of substances \n\nthat can be used as dye tracers. Experiments have been made with different kinds of dyes \n\nincluding Rhodamine (BA and WT), Fluorescent dyes (Fluorescein) or even regular food dyes \n\n(Amaranth 85, E 123) (Rummel et al., 2002). Fluorescent dyes are becoming more popular, \n\ndue to its visibility even in low concentrations (Tauro et al., 2012).  \n\nAnother option is to use electrolyte tracers (e.g. USBR &amp; USDA, 2001; Shi et al., \n\n2012; Tingwu et al., 2005). This is often referred to as the salt-velocity method and consists in \n\nthe addition of a salt solution to the flow inducing a change in the electrical conductivity \n\nproperties of the water. The passage of the tracer is revealed by establishing and monitoring \n\nan electrical current in the sampling section. The electrical current vs. time graphs allows the \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2.

However, instead of a solid object, the tracer used is also a \n\nfluid that participates in the normal fluid processes, getting mixed and transported within the \n\nflow through convective and diffusion phenomena\u2019s (Figure  2.8). Therefore, the procedure is \n\nto measure the time that the tracer takes to travel between two sections. The distance between \n\nboth sections is then divided by the measured time, in order to compute velocity.  \n\nIn most cases, the velocity of the leading edge is measured. This velocity does not \n\ncorrespond to the mean flow velocity. Instead, it corresponds to the maximum velocity since \n\nthe tracer will follow the highest velocity path. Thus, the obtained velocity must be multiplied \n\nby a coefficient to obtain the mean velocity, and this introduces an error in the estimation. \n\nThe tracer-velocity method has the advantage of requiring small quantities of tracer, \n\nwhen compared to tracer-dilution method (continuous injection). This method can also be \n\nused for long distance measurements (sampling section over 50 km downstream from \n\ninjection point). In this case, dye losses along the way can be significant, thus more dye is \n\nnecessary. \n\n  \n\n   a)                b) \n\n  \nFigure ?2.8 - Dye tracing field experiments examples: a) Rhodamine (Global Underwater Explorers, 2013); \n\nb) Fluorescent dyes (Fondriest, 2013) \n\n \n\nhttp://www.fondriest.com/news/rhodaminedyetracersystem.htm\nhttp://www.globalunderwaterexplorers.org/content/ames-sink-tracer-test\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2.

It consists in the addition to the flow of a known \n\nquantity of a highly concentrated solution of either dye or salt. In a measuring section \n\ndownstream a detection device is used (fluorometer for dyes and electrodes for salt, as \n\ndescribed above).  \n\nDischarge is computed from the concentration balance between the injection and \n\nsampling section (Rantz, 1982). Therefore, complete vertical and lateral mixing in the \n\nsampling section is assumed and accuracy of results are highly dependent on it. The amount \n\nof losses of tracer (exchanges of tracer between flow and soil such as adsorption or salts \n\ndissolved from the soil), also influence accuracy. Thus, there is an optimum travel time and \n\nlength that ensures proper mixing without significant losses. However, for short distances dye \n\nloss is usually not significant. \n\nThe injection of tracer can be done in a single slug or by a continuous injection. Figure \n\n 2.9 shows the concentration versus time graph in the sampling for both types of injection. In \n\nthe latter case, the graph exhibits a \u201cplateau\u201d because the tracer is injected during a certain \n\nperiod of time, inducing a constant concentration in the sampling section downstream. In this \n\ncase, discharge is computed from the knowledge of the injection conditions (volume and \n\nconcentration) and from the integration of the concentration versus time curve (measuring \n\nsection). \n\nBesides facilitating the injection process, choosing the slug injection option also has \n\nthe advantage of reducing the amount of tracer used.  \n\nIt\u2019s important to refer that no geometry nor stage measurements are needed to compute \n\ndischarge, what can be a strong advantage over other methods, especially if the stream is \n\ninaccessible (e.g. measurements in mountain torrents). \n\n \n\n \nFigure ?2.9 - Concentration vs. time graphs at the sampling section: a) slug injection; b) continuous injection \n\n(adapted from Kirkpatrick &amp; Shelley, 1975). \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 2.

In order to obtain the mean velocity value, this value must be multiplied by a \n\ncorrection coefficient, usually referred to by the Greek letter ? (Li et al., 1996). However, due \n\nto the intrinsic relation between flow velocity and many other variables and conditions such \n\nas turbulence (defined by the Reynolds number), slope, flow variation with time (steady or \n\nunsteady) or sediment content, the determination and systematization of this calibration \n\ncoefficient is still a challenge for researchers. Added complications appear in field \n\napplications of tracer techniques, with even more unknown variables and presence of rocks \n\nand vegetation.  \n\nAcross literature, different authors presented results obtained for a wide range of \n\nconditions. Some discovered relations with sediment transport, others variation with slope or \n\neven with the Reynolds number (e.g. Zhang et al., 2010; Dunkerley, 2001). Mean correction \n\nfactor values fluctuate between 0.53 and 0.67. This illustrates the difficulties, dispersion of \n\nresults and even contradictions faced by many researchers that, in the last three decades, \n\nstruggled to define this coefficient. In the present thesis, the value proposed by Li &amp; \n\nAbrahams (1996), ? = 0.67, will be used, as it\u2019s the commonly recommended value. \n\n \n\n2.6. Final Comment on Hydrometry \n\nA wide range of powerful and accurate techniques is now available. The main challenges for \n\nhydrometry (Coz, 2008) are now to maintain and improve data quality, without increasing the \n\nneed for more resources (e.g. cost, human resources) for its collection. Standards and goals \n\nshould however be achievable and realistic. In addition, environmental concerns have also \n\nbecome an important topic, (e.g. the use of dyes can be have a negative environmental \n\nimpact). \n\nThe knowledge of the multiple available techniques and the awareness of their \n\nlimitations, applicability and inevitable uncertainties is crucial for the selection of the most \n\nadequate technique and measuring site. The use of various techniques simultaneously (as \n\ncomplement or to fill each other\u2019s limitations) and the repetition of the measurement process \n\n(if possible, accordingly to the quickness of the technique) are important in order to minimize \n\npotential errors and uncertainties.  \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 3.

WATER FLOW VISUALIZATION \n\n \n\n3.1. Initial Considerations \n\nSome of the previously referred methods illustrate the thin frontier between flow \n\nmeasurement and flow visualization techniques. In fact, by being able to visualize the flow, \n\nit\u2019s possible to infer about velocity fields. With the recent developments in imaging \n\ntechnology, significant improvements and results have been achieved from the use of \n\ntechniques such as the Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV), Particle Tracking Velocimetry \n\n(PTV) or the Planar Concentration Analysis (PCA). There is, however, still a long way ahead, \n\nsince it\u2019s complicated to interpret data involving turbulence, complicated boundaries, \n\nviscosity or shock wave effects.  \n\nThere are mainly three different approaches on which flow visualization is based \n\n(Merzkirch, 1974).  The first one consists in adding a different material to the flowing fluid \n\nand then using the referred optical imaging methods to track its motion. Therefore, the tracer \n\nmethod for flow visualization previously referred in section  2.5.9 belongs to this category. \n\nIt\u2019s considered an indirect method since the results are obtained by measuring the tracer \n\nmotion instead. The assumption is that the tracer and fluid motion are exactly the same, which \n\nmay not be exactly true, especially in unsteady flows.  \n\nAnother approach relies in the fact that fluid density is a function of the refraction \n\nindex. Thus, optical methods are sensitive to these variations in density and allow to obtain a \n\nvisual pattern from which quantitative or qualitative data can be obtained. They are non-\n\ndisturbing methods and some examples include shadowgraphy, schlieren or interferometry.  \n\nFinally, the last approach consists in exposing part of the flow to energy in the form of \n\nheat or electrical discharge in order to mark them and make them visible through the use of \n\noptical methods (thymol blue, hydrogen bubbles). The method described in the present thesis \n\nis a good example of this kind of approach, since it consists in heating the water and then \n\nusing a thermographic camera to track its motion. However, in the case of adding hot water to \n\nthe flow, this same technique can be classified as a heat tracer technique. Either way, its \n\nprinciple is to track the heat downstream. \n\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize that the flow patterns obtained with these techniques are \n\nquite difficult to analyze and to model, mostly due to the complex processes that are involved, \n\neven using powerful computers. Flow visualization can, however, provide useful qualitative \n\nand quantitative information about flow properties, such as velocity, frequency or density. \n\nIt has many applications, especially for analyzing velocity, waves, mixing processes, vortices, \n\neddies or wakes. \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 3. WATER FLOW VISUALIZATION \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 26 \n\n \n\nA noteworthy fact is that these flow visualization methods are widely used, not only in \n\nliquid flows, but also in gases.  \n\nIn the next paragraphs, the most relevant flow visualization techniques for this thesis \n\npurposes will be overviewed.  \n\n \n\n3.2. Flow Visualization Techniques \n\n3.2.1. PIV and PTV \n\nIn the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) \n\ntechniques, a flow homogeneously seeded with particles is illuminated by a sheet of light. \n\nUsing an optical system, the positions of the particles at consecutive moments are recorded \n\nand its displacements are analyzed. The result is a planar map with instantaneous velocity \n\nvectors that represent the velocity field of the flow (Figure  3.1). \n\nThe main difference between PIV and PTV is the obtained image density. In PTV \n\nmethod, a single particle can unambiguously be tracked (Bradley et al., 2002). On the \n\ncontrary, if the distance between particles is too short, it\u2019s no longer possible to track each \n\nparticle individually, and the matching of pairs of particles is determined statistically. Thus, in \n\nthe PIV method, a not well defined region emerges, where the displacements of particles are \n\nobtained through a statistical method and a spatial correlation analysis is carried to obtain the \n\nvelocity field, based on a continuity equation (number of particles remain the same). Because \n\nthe motion of more particles is studied, PIV technique provides more information than the \n\nPTV. \n\nAlthough it\u2019s not a new technique, its use has increased significantly in the last years \n\ndue to the easier access to charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras and more powerful \n\ncomputers. Thus, it has become a well-established as a non-intrusive technique for flow \n\nmeasurement and visualization of a whole field (e.g. Nobach &amp; Tropea, 2005, Meinhart et al., \n\n2000). However, this technique still requires a relatively complex and expensive set up \n\n(require high power lasers), hardly suitable for experiments in the field, due to its limited \n\nportability. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Hydrogen Bubbles \n\nBy using an electric current to induce an electrolysis in the water, hydrogen bubbles can be \n\nproduced to act as visible tracers. The bubbles created, due to their dimension, adequately \n\nfollow the motion of the flow, and are another suitable option for flow visualization. The \n\nbubbles are created around the wire and are swept by the flow, following its motion. The \n\ndiameters of the bubbles are similar to the diameter of the wire and are visible by illuminating \n\nthe stream. Due to flotation, the bubbles show tendency to ascend. Lu &amp; Smith (1985) first \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 3. WATER FLOW VISUALIZATION \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 27 \n\n \n\npresented the technique as a suitable method for the determination of the local velocity \n\nbehavior and how turbulence properties could be evaluated. \n\n \n\n3.2.3. Thymol Blue \n\nThymol blue is often used as a pH indicator, as it allows establishing a pH range \n\n(e.g. Merzkirch, 1974; Merzkirch, 2007). It can either be red, yellow or blue accordingly to \n\nthe pH of the solution it contacts with. Relying on the creation of hydrogen ions induced by \n\nelectrolysis to increase the overall solution pH, the thymol blue changes color to blue near the \n\nelectric wire. By using electric pulses, a well-defined blue line is clearly visible and allows \n\nvisualization of velocity profiles. \n\n \n\n3.2.4. Bubble Image Velocimetry (BIV) \n\nThe Bubble Image Velocimetry (BIV) is often considered a variation of the PIV technique \n\n(Lin et al., 2008). BIV consist in tracking the liquid-gas interfaces present in the flow (e.g. air \n\nbubbles), instead of solid particles used in the PIV. Concerning the illumination and \n\nobtainment of the images, the Shadowgraph method is used. A light is placed behind the flow \n\nand the shadow of the bubbles are captured and consequently processed with PIV software to \n\ncorrelate its positions in consecutive images to construct the vectorial velocity field. This \n\nprocedure dismisses the use of expensive high power laser system, facilitating its \n\nimplementation and use in the laboratories.  \n\nThis technique aims at the visualization of aerated bubbly flows. For example, as the \n\nbubbly aerated regions of the flow are complex to analyze with the PIV method (problem with \n\nuncontrolled scatter of laser light), BIV has been used as a complementary technique to fill \n\nthis flaw (Figure  3.1; Ryu et al., 2005). The density and size of the bubbles have to comply \n\nwith seeding requirements in order to ensure that they can be identified and separated for the \n\nanalysis. \n\nHillier et al. (2010) also used similar procedures, however successfully using the \n\nclassic hydrogen bubbles principle as a seeding medium. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 3.

Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) \n\nIn the Planar Laser Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) techniques (Ferrier et al., 1993), a laser light \n\nsheet is used for exciting fluorescent dyes molecules (usually Rhodamine). As a result, the \n\nmolecules acquire a higher electronic energy state. Thus, as the energy is released, \n\nfluorescence of the molecules is induced. The resulting fluorescence is recorded and, after \n\ncalibration, its intensity can be related with temperature or dye concentration. The obtained \n\nmaps can be used for flow visualization purposes (Crimaldi &amp; Koseff, 2001). \n\n \n\n3.2.6. Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) \n\nSimilarly to LDV technique (section  2.5.3), Planar Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) or Doppler \n\nGlobal Velocimetry (DGV) also uses the Doppler shift of the backscatter from the particles to \n\ncompute the multidimensional velocity field. However, instead of single beams, DGV uses a \n\nlaser light sheet to illuminate a whole area of the flow (Nobes et al., 2004). \n\nIt\u2019s a relatively new technique that has some advantages over the PIV technique \n\n(Samimy &amp; Wernet, 2000), such as allowing higher speed flow measurements, higher \n\nresolution analysis, velocity analysis without directional ambiguity, or possibility of using \n\nsmaller particles (improved tracer characteristics).

Planar Concentrartion Analysis (PCA) \n\nRummel et al. (2002) developed a method for dye tracing analysis, where recorded video \n\nimages were used to obtain dye concentration values by statistically analyzing color intensity \n\n(Leandro et al., 2012). MathLab is used to convert pixel intensity to concentration values, \n\naccording to a transfer equation algorithm, thus creating a concentration map. The process \n\ninvolves going through several steps to improve image quality and through proper calibration \n\nof the transfer function. Because this technique is very sensitive to illumination variations, the \n\nexperimental set up involves the use of sheets in order to ensure good and homogeneous \n\nuniform illumination of the camera\u2019s field of view, making it only suitable for lab \n\nexperiments (Figure  3.2). \n\nThis technique, when compared to other flow visualization methods such as the PIV, \n\nrequires a simple and affordable set up and can be a valuable option for shallow flows dye \n\ntracing analysis.  \n\n \n\n\u00a8  \n\nFigure ?3.2 \u2013 a) Sheet to ensure uniform illumination; b) Distribution of the time-mean concentration, evaluated \n\nwith the PCA (Rummel et al., 2002). \n\n \n\n3.3. Infrared Technology \n\n3.3.1. Thermography \n\nInfrared (IR) represents the electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths between 0.74 microns \n\nand 1000 microns. This represents the zone in the electromagnetic spectrum (Figure  3.3) \n\nbetween the visible light and microwaves and humans can perceive it as heat. Every object \n\nabove the absolute zero in temperature scale (?273.15\u00b0C) emits infrared and its emittance \n\nincreases with temperature. \n\nThermography is a technique for detection and measurement of the radiated thermal \n\nenergy (FLIR, 2013).

These signals are then processed to obtain \n\nan image that can be displayed in a monitor, associated to a grey or color scale. After \n\ncalibration, thermographic cameras can also provide temperature values, depending on the \n\nused software. \n\nHowever, not the entire IR spectrum is visible through thermography. Most common \n\nIR cameras can detect radiation in the LWIR band (long-wavelength infrared - 8?m-14?m), \n\nwhich include most applications at ambient temperatures. \n\n \n\n \n\n \nFigure ?3.3 - Infrared radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum (adapted from MVIM, 2013). \n\n \n\nIt\u2019s important to note that glass is opaque in the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) \n\nband, blocking the radiation emitted by the objects behind it. In addition, emissivity is a \n\nphysical property of materials that describes the efficiency of how it radiates. Thus, two \n\nmaterials with different emissivity may appear differently in thermal imaging, despite having \n\nthe same temperature. It\u2019s also important to emphasize that thermographic cameras detect the \n\nenergy that radiates through the surface, not the temperature of the object itself. \n\nDue to the recent reduction of costs of these cameras along with the increased \n\nportability, thermography application range has increased considerably. It has been used \n\nextensively as night vision technology in military and law enforcement operations (Figure \n\n 4.4). It is also becoming a consolidated technique for uses in industry, building inspections \n\nand electrical systems diagnosis, mainly because it\u2019s a safe and accurate method of detecting \n\nproblems (Page et al., 1992). It is also becoming an important tool for uses in research in \n\ndiverse fields of knowledge, since it provides an effective, fast and accurate method of \n\nmonitoring temperature. \n\n \n\nMicrowaves, Radio UV, X-rays \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 3.

Applications of Infrared Technology in Hydraulics \n\nAlong the decades, infrared technology has been occasionally used in hydraulic studies. Due \n\nto the reason referred in the previous section, its applications in water resources, hydrology \n\nand soil and water preservation have recently been developing significantly.  \n\nOne of its major focus is large scale aerial thermal scans. These can provide valuable \n\ninformation for various purposes. For example, by obtaining sequences of high resolution \n\ntemperature maps (thermal gradients) from oceanic waters, it\u2019s possible to infer about near \n\nsurface velocities, as described by Chen et al. (2008), Chen et al. (2012) and \n\nVeron et al. (2008).  \n\nAnother effective use is to scan watersheds to search for groundwater inflows (seeps) \n\nand karst hydrogeology formations (e.g. Jester, 2000; Campbell et al., 1996). These are easily \n\nidentified because groundwater is released with different temperature than surface waters \n\n(e.g. during winter, groundwater is warmer than surface water, exposed to low atmospheric \n\ntemperatures), thus appearing with a different color intensity in infrared images (Danielescu et \n\nal., 2009). In addition, these remote sensing techniques can also provide other types of \n\nrelevant hydrological information (e.g. water quality indicators, identification of local \n\npollution sources, characterization of pollutant movement and dispersion) (Rayne &amp; \n\nHenderson, 2004).  \n\nHowever, the use of infrared thermography for these purposes still has to overcome \n\nsome weaknesses such as the influence of interference originated by unwanted emissive \n\nradiation, thermal stratification problems, or thermal boundary layer effects.  \n\nThe use of IR thermography for quantitative flow measurements hasn\u2019t been \n\nextensively explored yet, and its capabilities have yet to be studied. Some successful \n\nexamples can already be found in the literature. Below some examples of research works are \n\npresented, which are relevant for the present technique due to their similarity of procedures or \n\nbecause they share a similar principle. \n\n \n\nThermal Sensors \n\nSensors using heat related principles (Ashauer et al., 1998) are frequently used in flow \n\nmeasurements in conduits. Measurements can be based on heat losses considerations \n\n(e.g. thermal anemometers \u2013 section  2.5.3). Instead, using the thermal transfer principle, by \n\nmeasuring the energy and the resulting temperature increment, it\u2019s possible to compute the \n\nflow discharge (e.g. calorimeters). Finally, some sensors are based on the thermal time of \n\nflight principle, where heat pulses are generated and used to compute velocity. The present \n\nthesis approach to measure velocity is similar; however, it\u2019s implemented on larger spatial \n\nand temporal scales. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 3. WATER FLOW VISUALIZATION \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 32 \n\n \n\nMicrofluidic devices application \n\nA velocity measurement technique employed in microfluidic silicon devices (micro-\n\nelectromechanical system) has been presented by Chung &amp; Grigoropoulos (2003) and Liu et \n\nal. (2005). Due to their small dimensions, most flow meters are not adequate. Thus, this \n\ntechnique is presented as a high prospect solution for this problem. The fluid is heated by a \n\npulsed infrared laser beam and relies on the fact that silicon is transparent for IR wave lengths \n\nand consequently thermography can detect heat gradients through the silicon. The results \n\nshowed an accuracy of around 10% on mean velocity measurements. The acronym used to \n\nrefer to this technique was ITV (Infrared Thermal Velocimetry). \n\n \n\nTurbulence visualization  \n\nUsing similar procedures, in a wide open flow flume, Liang &amp; Chong (2011) studied the \n\nfeasibility of using thermography to visualize turbulent mixing processes in shallow flows. \n\nThe hot water was injected behind a cylinder that originated the turbulent structures (wake \n\nand vortices). It has been concluded that the results agree with past studies using traditional \n\ntechniques. \n\n \n\nSolute transport assessment  \n\nA similar technique to the one presented in this thesis, involving slug hot water addition to the \n\nflow and infrared thermography, was presented by Schuetz et al. ( 2012). The technique was \n\napplied in the field to wetlands in order to study solute transport processes. Mean flow \n\nvelocity, dispersion and dominating flow paths could also be remotely detected in this work. \n\nHowever, in contrast to the technique described in the present thesis, it dealt with lower \n\nvelocities and the temperature values provided by the camera allowed a different approach, \n\nnamely for the analysis of cooling effects (advection, dispersion and conduction). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 4.

Velocity Measurements (ADV) \n\nFor comparison purposes, additional velocity measurement equipment was required. Thus, a \n\nSonTek/YSI 16-MHz MicroADV (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter) with a 2D side-looking \n\nprobe was used in the experiments (Figure  4.6). This probe is the most adequate option when \n\ndealing with shallow water depths. It allows velocity measurements in channels as shallow as \n\n3 cm and as narrow as 5 cm (SonTek, 2008). Table  4.4 shows the full specifications of the \n\nADV. \n\nThe setup of the equipment was simple since it required no further calibration. SonTek \n\nHorizon ADV software was used for data acquisition from the device. Velocity measurements \n\nwere obtained by computing the average from 600 samples. \n\nThe air bubbles originated by the inevitable turbulence of the water flow were \n\nsufficient to reflect the acoustic signals, allowing the ADV to detect and compute velocity. \n\nDuring experiments, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) indicated by the SonTek software was \n\naround 40, which is above the SNR recommended minimum value (15), thus the flow was \n\nwell seeded and measurements were reliable. \n\nTable ?4.4 - ADV specifications (adapted from SonTek, 2008). \n\nSampling rate 0.1 to 50 Hz \n\nSampling volume 0.09 cm\n3\n \n\nDistance to sampling volume 5 cm \n\nResolution 0.01 cm/s \n\nVelocity range 1 mm/s to 2.5 m/s, \n\nProgrammed velocity range 3, 10, 30, 100, 250 cm/s \n\nAccuracy 1% of measured velocity, 0.25 cm/s \n\nMax Depth 60 m \n\nInput Voltage 12-24 VDC \n\nPower Consumption 2.5 to 4 W \n\n \n\n \n\n    \nFigure ?4.6 - Different components of the used ADV: a) conditioning module; b) processor; c) 2D side-looking \n\nprobe.  \n\na) b) c) \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 4.

Procedures \n\nBecause the present work consists in the development of a novel technique, the experimental \n\nwork had to go through a trial and error process in order to select the most effective setup \n\nand procedures. The different phases of this process will be outlined in this section. \n\nRegarding the positioning of the camera, it was easily observed that the most favorable \n\noption was undoubtedly to hang the camera over the flume, perpendicularly to the flow. \n\nAn attempt to visualize the flow from the side was quickly abandoned, because the acrylic \n\nmaterial from the flume is opaque to thermographic cameras and consequently blocks the IR \n\nradiation. Placing the camera pointing upstream obliquely to the flow was also not a good \n\noption because, besides the distortion originated, reflections from both the acrylic walls and \n\nthe water surface compromised the quality of the recordings. This latter solution, despite not \n\nbeing the most efficient, can still be used in situations where placing the camera \n\nperpendicularly to the flow is complicated. As an example, in a field application of a similar \n\ntechnique, (Schuetz et al., 2012) recorded the flow by installing the camera downstream from \n\nthe analyzed area, and then applied a distortion to the images in order to be able to analyze \n\nthem. In addition, in field measurements or in wider flumes, the acrylic reflections are not a \n\nproblem. \n\nIn order to obtain a spatial reference, before each experiment, hot water was spread \n\nalong the full width of the channel, highlighting the channel bed (Figure  4.7) and allowing the \n\nidentification and measurement of the channel width (known distance). Alternatively, any \n\nother two temperature markers (IR leds or an object of a material with a different emissivity \n\nor temperature) separated by a known distance would allow the spatial calibration of the \n\nobtained images (necessary to compute velocity). \n\n \n\n \n\n   \nFigure ?4.7 - Spatial calibration for the experiments: a) hot water spread; b) flume width. \n\n \n\nThe FLIR camera, when turned on inside the room at ambient temperature, revealed \n\npractically no image resolve. While down looking at the flow, it was possible to identify a \n\nflume width \n\n(spatial calibration) \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 4.

An example of the obtained images is presented in Figure  4.8. \n\nBrighter colors represent higher temperatures while lower temperature surfaces are darker. It \n\nclearly exhibits the downwards movement of the heated water. Due to high flow speeds, the \n\nimage faded fast.  \n\nAt an early stage, by comparing the velocity of the heated water mass with the velocity \n\nobtained through the use of floats, it was possible to confirm that these procedures could \n\nprovide an estimation of the flow surface velocity.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure ?4.8 \u2013 Example of the obtained images and schematization of the procedure used in the experiments for \n\nadding the thermal tracer (hot water) to the flow. \n\n \n\nThe obtained surface velocity was multiplied by a correction factor ?=0.67 (Abrahams \n\n&amp; Li, 1998), usually used in tracer methods for converting from the surface velocity to the \n\nmean flow velocity (see section  0 2.5.9).  \n\nIn order to validate the experiments as a proof of principle of the technique, sets of \n\nexperiments were conducted simultaneously with an ADV (section  4.1.4), which is \n\nconsidered a well-established and trustworthy velocity measurement technique. \n\nThe next step was to test different water heating methods and to try to improve the \n\nwater heating process. The tested methods are described in section  4.4. Similarly, some notes \n\non the image processing phase are presented in section  4.3. \n\n \n\n4.3. Images Interpretation \n\nThe image interpretation phase, due to its direct influence on accuracy, is crucial for the \n\nsuccess of this technique. This process has high resemblances with the dye tracing technique, \n\nwhere the progression (time of travel) of the dye cloud is measured visually. However, for \n\ndyes, these measurements are usually made using stopwatches and human reaction errors are \n\nlikely to be significant. In the present technique, this kind of errors is reduced due to the use \n\nThermographic \n\nCamera \n\n \n\nFlow direction \n\n \n\nHot water mass visible \n\nthrough Thermography \n\n \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 4. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 40 \n\n \n\nof recorded images. The video player capabilities (e.g. start, stop, move forward, rewind) \n\nallow a precise frame by frame analysis that would be impossible to accomplish with human \n\nreaction time uncertainties. Furthermore, it also allows more time and tools to properly infer \n\nabout the heated water mass delimitation (identification of the leading front). \n\nFor mean flow velocity estimation purposes, there are two options to analyze the \n\ndownstream motion of a mass of tracer. Some authors track the center of mass (Kirkpatrick &amp; \n\nShelley, 1975) while others assume that the leading edge of the tracer mass is the one that \n\nshould be studied (Roels, 1984). Similarly, if fluorometers are being used (in dye \n\nexperiments), the peak concentration or the first detected concentrations can be used. \n\nBy considering the velocity of the leading edge, the mean velocity will most likely be \n\noverestimated, when compared to cases when the center of mass movement is considered. \n\nIn an attempt to improve accuracy and minimize the ambiguity and overestimation in mean \n\nvelocity determination through dye tracer methods, Abrahams et al. (1986) proposed a \n\nmethod for obtaining the mean velocity of a stream, considering the variation of the velocity \n\nalong the width of the stream. Based on current meters subsections averaged velocity \n\nAbrahams proposed a division of the stream in subsections and an independent determination \n\nof the leading edge velocity for each subsection. The global mean velocity would finally be \n\ncomputed from an average of all the velocities.  \n\nIn the present thesis, an adaptation of Abrahams\u2019 method (Abrahams et al., 1986) will \n\nbe used. The leading heated water front will be divided in three subsections and the mean \n\nvelocity of the leading edge in each one of them will be computed. The mean velocity of the \n\nwhole hot water front will then be obtained by computing the average of the three values. \n\nFor wider flumes and therefore wider study zone, more subsections can be chosen, in \n\norder to increase accuracy. For the present experimental setup, it was considered that three \n\nsubsections were enough to properly represent the advance of the front. \n\nThe experiments resulted in footages in a compressed \u201c.avi\u201d file format. This was a \n\nlimitation because some programs are only compatible with the un-compressed \u201c.avi\u201d file \n\n(e.g. imageJ). After several tryouts of multiple video and image editing software, the choice \n\nfell on Adobe\u2019s Premiere Pro CS5.5 for applying some effects to the video, in order to \n\naccentuate and improve the visualization of the heat tracer, and then onto Kinovea, an open \n\nsource video player, that stepped up as the most agile and easy to use tool for the quantitative \n\nanalysis of the files.  \n\nAdobe Premiere CS5.5 is a powerful professional video editing software that allows \n\nusers to work directly on the timeline (timeline based). It facilitates the mixing of different \n\nvideos and features a big collection of effects. It was used for subtracting background, adding \n\neffects such as contrast, brightness, color substitution, color control, with the objective of \n\nenhancing visualization. Depending on the water heating method, there were cases where this \n\nimage treatment could be skipped, because the hot water was already clearly visible. There \n\nwere also cases where, even after these steps, it was impossible to properly visualize the \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 4.

A similar approach was made by Chung &amp; Grigoropoulos (2003) and Narayanan et al. \n\n(2003) where the radiative image of the background was subtracted from the full image with \n\nthe heated flow, isolating the tracer. Then, the noise was smoothed using a Gaussian low pass \n\nfilter effect. The results of this procedure can be seen in Figure  4.9. \n\n \n\n \nFigure ?4.9 - Example of a similar image processing procedure: a) background image; b) captured heated water \n\nc) image with subtracted background; d) final image with Gauss Low Pass effect (adapted from Chung &amp; \n\nGrigoropoulos, 2003). \n\n \n\nKinovea is an open source software, developed for sport videos analysis. It\u2019s a video \n\nmanipulation tool that allows measurement of distances and angles, point marking, side by \n\nside video comparison, tracking of objects, zoom and other useful features. This program was \n\nused to analyze the footage. It allowed the introduction of a grid and provided other useful \n\ntools like lines, and measurement tools, that facilitated the division of the heated mass in \n\nsubsections (Figure  4.10). \n\n \n\n \nFigure ?4.10 - Kinovea software screenshot with the grid and a drawn hot water mass front. \n\n \n\nAs an alternative, if video editing software is not available, the frames could easily be \n\nextracted from the video file (e.g. \u201cFree Video to JPG Converter\u201d) and analyzed frame by \n\nframe, as a succession of images.

Some early experiments were analyzed using this procedure. \n\nThe procedure for the acquisition of data for velocity computations is represented in \n\nFigure  4.11. The images were analyzed by defining two sections (yellow lines) separated by a \n\nvariable distance (20 cm in this example). Similarly to the floats\u2019 method (section  2.5.8, \n\nFigure  2.7) the time that the leading edge takes to travel between both sections was measured \n\n(t2-t1). This was registered for three different subsections (left, center, right), whose central \n\nlines are represented in Figure  4.11 by three vertical lines. Finally, the velocity is computed \n\nby dividing the travel distance by the time interval, the mean velocity from the three \n\nsubsections is calculated and the correction factor is applied (section  2.5.9). \n\n \n\n \n\n  \nFigure ?4.11 - Image interpretation procedure using Kinovea software. \n\n \n\n4.4. Heat Generation \n\nAn ideal water heating method would be able to heat the water to a temperature easily \n\ndetected by the camera, while causing low flow disturbance. It should also be easily \n\naccessible (low cost), versatile and portable for eventual field uses. In order to enhance \n\nvelocity profile visualization, it should be able to homogeneously heat the full width of the \n\nstream. This would allow tracking the downstream motion and evolution of a straight line and \n\nprovide valuable information about the velocity profile.  \n\nSimilar experiments were already made for the flow of air and gases \n\n(Narayanan et al., 2003). However, due to the heat capacity of water (4.1813 J g\n-1 \n\n\u00baC\n-1\n\n, at \n\n25 \u00baC) being approximately 4 times larger than air\u2019s (1.0035 J g\n-1 \n\n\u00baC\n-1\n\n, at 0 \u00baC), considerably \n\nmore energy is needed to heat the water, especially when compared to the amount of energy \n\nneeded for the same experiment for air flow visualization (Matsumura &amp; Antonia, 2006). \n\nt2=1:03:36.96 t1=1:03:36.19 \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 4. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 43 \n\n \n\nTherefore, different methods were tested with the equipment available in the \n\nlaboratory, in order to find the most suitable and effective option, which are described in the \n\nnext sub-sections. \n\n \n\n4.4.1. Hot Water Addition \n\nMost experiments were conducted by adding water heated by an electric kettle into the flow. \n\nThis, however, has unwanted implications. On the one hand, it is not easy to homogeneously \n\nadd water through the width of the flume. On the other hand, the water dumping may cause \n\nunwanted disturbance in the flow such as waves or even significantly change the discharge \n\nvalue (depending on the amount of water added). Thus, a tradeoff has to be made in order not \n\nto add too much water that would change the flow, and to add enough water to ensure it is \n\ndetected by the IR camera. \n\nIt was observed that the technique of adding water to the flow strongly influenced the \n\nquality of the visualization. It was noted that by dropping the water, it would sink and \n\nconsequently complicate its detection by the thermographic camera. Alternatively, if the \n\ncontainer was simply turned into the horizontal position, letting the water flow out by itself, \n\nthe hot water would remain on the surface (hot water is less dense), enhancing visualization. \n\nFigure  4.12 illustrates this situation by showing the first case on the left, and the second on \n\nthe right.  \n\nExperiments were made with a coffee cup, designed for retaining heat (material with \n\nlow thermal conductivity). However, it was observed that the pouring technique was the most \n\ndeterminant factor for the success of the technique.  \n\nA wider recipient was also used in an attempt to release the hot water uniformly along \n\nthe full width. However this wasn\u2019t very successful because it was more difficult to control \n\nthe pouring and it introduced considerably more disturbance into the flow, when compared to \n\na single cup. \n\na)          b) \n\n   \nFigure ?4.12 - Comparison between two different water addition procedure: a) dropping hot water that imediately \n\nsinks; b) carefully letting the hot water flow out of the cup (water remains at the surface). \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 4. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 44 \n\n \n\n \n\nFrom all the tested water heating methods, pouring water using a single cup was the \n\none used more extensively, mostly because it provided the best way to clearly see the leading \n\nfront of hot water. A comparison between the results of different quantities of added water \n\n(87.5 ml, 175 ml and 350 ml) will be presented in the Results section.  \n\n \n\n4.4.2. Heated Metal Slab \n\nIn this method, a gas torch was used to heat the edge of a thin metal slab (Figure  4.13). The \n\nedge of the slab is then submerged and its heat is transferred to the flowing water. It is \n\nobserved that the slab cools fast when in contact with the water. \n\nThe slab has either been placed vertically with the largest side parallel or \n\nperpendicular to the flow. When placed perpendicularly, it originated considerably more \n\ndisturbance in the flow, as it\u2019s easily explained by the size of the obstruction introduced. \n\nIt\u2019s visible the formation of turbulent flow structures from the sides of the slab and its motion \n\nand evolution downstream. This method can be useful for visualization of turbulent \n\nstructures; Liang &amp; Chong (2011) already used a thermographic camera to study these \n\nprocesses by injecting hot water behind a cylinder. However, it might be interesting to use a \n\nheated piece of metal instead. \n\n \n\n    \nFigure ?4.13 \u2013 Experiments using a heated metal lab: a) torch heating the slab; b) metal slab placed parallelly to \n\nthe flow; c) IR image of experiments with the metal slab placed parallelly to the flow; d) IR image of \n\nexperiments with the metal slab placed perpendicularly to the flow. \n\n \n\n4.4.3. Heat Gun \n\nExploratory experiments were also conducted using a heat gun pointing at the flow. However, \n\nthis method produced a strong stream of hot air that considerably disturbed the existing flow, \n\ncompromising the results. Nevertheless, by approximating the heat gun to the flow, the \n\nresulting thermal images revealed a circular mass of heated water flowing downstream \n\n(Figure  4.14). \n\n \n\na) b) c) d) \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 4.

Heated Electrical Wire \n\nThe last attempt was to use a wire heated by an electrical current to heat the flowing water \n\n(Figure  4.15). The wood structure was adapted to fit inside the flume. A battery charger \n\nestablished an electrical current onto the wire. The current was pulsed, originating cycles of \n\n6 seconds on followed by 6 seconds off. \n\nHowever, the heated water was barely visible (Figure  4.15c). Even after editing the \n\nimages for background removal or applying contrast, gamma, and brightness adjustments, it \n\nwas impossible to infer about velocity. Clearly, the wire didn't heat the water enough, \n\nmeaning that a more powerful device is needed. This method was not further explored in this \n\nwork, but the expectation is that this method would allow to homogeneously heat the flowing \n\nwater along the width of the flume, thus providing a lot of useful information. \n\n \n\n \n\n   \nFigure ?4.15 - Experiments using electrical current to heat the flow: a) structure adapted and placed into the \n\nflume; b) an electric wire was connected to a pulsed battery charger; c) IR image of the heated electric wire and \n\nits effect in the flowing water.  \n\nHeated electric wire \n\nBarely visible \n\nheated water \n\nHeated electric \n\nwire (IR) \n\na) b) c) \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 5.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\n5.1. Initial Considerations \n\nIn this chapter the results from the experiments are presented and discussed. It is divided in \n\nfour different sections. In the first one, proofs of principle experiments are carried out for \n\ndifferent flow depths and slopes. Then, the sensibility and response of the technique to \n\nvariations in the water heating process and in the image interpretation process are analyzed. \n\nFinally, some other aspects and experiments are discussed. \n\nThe used experimental setup allowed: i) varying the flow conditions, namely the \n\ndischarge/velocity (by adjusting the valve opening); ii) water depth (by adjusting the flume \n\ntailgate) and iii) slope. Concerning the water heating method, different methods (recipient hot \n\nwater addition, metal slab, heat gun), quantities of heated water and upstream heating \n\nlocations were tested. \n\nDuring the experiments, the fluid (water), section geometry and roughness (flume) \n\nremained unchanged. On the contrary, the quantity of water in the hydraulic system might \n\nvary (hot water added from the tap, despite being balanced by leaks in the flume), temperature \n\nof flowing water in the circuit might increase slightly after a set of experiments (heat from \n\npumps and hot water added to the recirculation circuit). Also, the hot water was heated once \n\nfor each set of experiments, meaning that temperature may decrease in time due to heat losses. \n\nThis was more significant and observable for the metal slab experiments which had to be \n\nheated again after four or five runs. \n\nThe presented results are mean values of sets of at least 6 runs (from 6 to 9). It is \n\nobserved that the flow velocity standard deviation values are relatively low, fluctuating \n\nbetween 0.41 and 1.84 cm/s for velocities between 8 cm/s and 20 cm/s. \n\n \n\n5.2. Proof of Principle \n\nFigure  5.1 shows a compilation of all the average velocities of the sets of experiments and its \n\ncorresponding standard deviations, compared to the values obtained using an ADV. It can be \n\nobserved that most values obtained by this technique are overestimated when compared to the \n\nreference values from the ADV. This can be explained by the influence of the heating water \n\nmethod and the ADV location. The linear fit also revealed a tendency: the overestimation \n\nincreases for lower flow velocities, what can be explained by the influence of the water \n\nheating method as will be analyzed in the following sections. \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 5.

Figure  5.2 \n\nshow a comparison between the obtained values with this heat tracer technique and an ADV \n\nreference velocity, this time identifying flow depths and slopes respectively. The technique \n\nperformed well for the multiple tested conditions. Therefore, results show that the technique \n\ncan be used for measurements in a wide range of water depths. Because hot water is less \n\ndense than colder water, as long as the hot water is properly poured into the flow surface or \n\nheated by a slab, it will remain in this top layer, thus allowing thermal visualization. Similarly \n\nto the dye tracing technique, the mean velocity can then be computed by multiplying the \n\nobtained surface velocity by the correction factor ?, as described before in section  2.5.9. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 5.

Technique\u2019s Velocity Range.  \n\nThe detectable velocity range for this technique is limited on an upper level by the camera \n\nframe rate. For the installation used in this thesis (IR camera hanged 1.5 m above the flume), \n\na display length of 55 cm was provided (maximum useful travel length of 40 cm assumed). \n\nTable  5.1 shows a correspondence between different flow velocities and the number of frames \n\ncaptured by the camera (with the hot water mass inside the recorded zone). It can be \n\nconcluded that this frame rate allows the detection of high velocity flows, providing at least \n\ntwo frames for velocities up to 500 cm/s (not tested in the present work). \n\nRegarding the applicability of the methodology for lower velocities, the limitation \n\nconcerns the water heating methods, with results becoming more or less overestimated, \n\ndepending on the method used and on the disturbances it induces to the flow, as it will be \n\nanalyzed below. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 5.

Effect of Channel Slope \n\nWhen experiments are performed with slopes other than 0%, the flow plane no longer \n\ncorresponds to the projection captured by the camera, thus the measured distances in the \n\nrecorded images do not correspond to the real distances. To account for this effect, the \n\nmeasured distances have to be increased, resulting in an increase of the velocity (water takes \n\nthe same time to travel a bigger distance). However, this effect has a minimal effect in the \n\nvelocities since it only starts being significant for slopes over 8% and velocities over 30 cm/s \n\n(assuming a travel distance of 15 cm). For these conditions (experiments performed for the \n\npresent thesis are below these values), the velocity increase will be of 0.1 cm/s which is \n\nconsiderably smaller than the standard deviation values obtained in the experiments. \n\nNevertheless, this was accounted for in the velocity computations from the experiments. \n\nA solution for this problem would be simply rotating the thermographic camera to match the \n\nchannel slope. However this was not done, thus the correction was applied. \n\n \n\n5.3. Water Heating Variables \n\n5.3.1. Different Quantities of Added Water \n\nIn order to study the effect of the quantity of added water variations in the final velocity \n\nresults, experiments were made using three different quantities (Figure  5.4), for three different \n\nvelocities. From the analysis of Figure  5.3 it is possible to conclude that the method is more \n\nsensible to these variations when dealing with lower velocities. In addition, higher quantities \n\nof added water increase the overestimation of flow velocities. These conclusions are in \n\naccordance with the expectations because this method is invasive and the conditions of the \n\nflow (discharge and velocity) can be altered, of course, depending on the amount of water \n\nadded. This effect being more significant for slower velocities is also logical as it is easier to \n\ndisturb such velocities. Also, the water pouring movement itself might have some influence \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 5.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nshallow flow visualization and quantitative estimation of velocity \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 51 \n\n \n\n For the following experiments, the medium quantity of water was used (175 ml). This \n\nquantity provides enough water to ensure proper visualization. Smaller quantities of water \n\nfade faster, loosing intensity and are more influenced by the turbulence originated by the \n\nintroduction of the hot water into the flow. Bigger quantities of water may complicate the \n\nanalysis because it can easily originate multiple masses of water that overlap each other, and \n\nthere isn\u2019t any clear advantage on using more water.  \n\n \n\n5.3.2. Wider Container \n\nAs an attempt to introduce water through the full width of the channel, a wider recipient was \n\nused. However, similarly to what was mentioned before, dropping water from above caused \n\nthe water to sink and thereby hindered its visualization. Therefore, in order to properly spill \n\nthe water into the flow it was necessary to touch the water with the container, so it could flow \n\nout. This procedure, with this wider recipient, inevitably originates a considerable barrier on \n\nthe top layer of the flow, which obstructed the flow, causing significant surface disturbances. \n\nIn addition, it was complicated to homogeneously release the water through the container \n\nedge. For these reasons, this attempt did not provide analyzable results and was abandoned in \n\nthis laboratory experiments. \n\n \n\n5.3.3. Distance from Hot Water Addition Point \n\nIn most experiments, water was added to the flow near the upstream edge of the recorded \n\narea. However, experiments were also made adding hot water at different distances upstream. \n\nFigure  5.5 shows that the overestimation described above related to water introduction \n\ndecreases as the water is introduced further upstream from the recorded area (in Figure  5.5 \n\ndata points are below the 1:1 line). Standard deviation parameters also follow the same \n\ntendency. Regarding the variation with velocity, no obvious conclusion can be drawn from \n\nresults. These conclusions can be explained by considering that the disturbance effect \n\noriginated when adding the water has enough time to get dissipated, and that the hot water has \n\nmore time to fully acquire the real flow velocity, thus presenting more accurate results. \n\nThis procedure also allowed perceiving that the hot water behavior highly depends on \n\nflow velocity. For faster flows, the hot water mass strictly followed the current lines, showing \n\nan elongated shape with minimal lateral mixing. For slower flows, the hot water spreads along \n\nthe full width and is more sensitive to disturbances in the flow.  \n\nAnother important outcome was that, in both cases, it was still possible to clearly \n\nidentify the hot water mass added at the upper end of the flume (3 m upstream), contradicting \n\nthe expectation that the hot water would rapidly mix with the colder water from the stream, \n\nbecoming barely visible after travelling a significant distance. This naturally varies with the \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 5.

Heated Metal Slab Experiments \n\nFigure  5.6 shows a comparison between the velocity values obtained using a metal slab to \n\nheat the water and by adding water to the flow (medium quantity \u2013 175 ml), for three different \n\nvelocities. Results obtained using a slab are systematically lower than the others. They also \n\npresented lower variability, with standard deviation values fluctuating between 0.52 and \n\n0.66 cm/s, in opposition to the standard deviation values from experiments with the addition \n\nof water that originated sets with standard deviations over 1 cm/s. The increase of \n\noverestimation for lower velocities in the hot water addition experiments was again \n\nconfirmed. In opposition, this same tendency wasn\u00b4t observed in the experiments using the \n\nslab. These results suggest that the use of the slab to heat the water causes less disturbances to \n\nthe flow and is more constant. This is a reasonable conclusion because the movement of \n\ninserting the slab in the water is less subject to variations, especially when compared to all the \n\nfactors that can interfere with the manual addition of hot water. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 5.

The fact of \n\nhaving recorded images that enable rewind and forward video capabilities, along with a 30 \n\nframes per second rate, contribute to the good degree of precision that can be achieved in this \n\nphase.

However, the results of this procedure didn\u2019t always \n\nmatch the expected outcomes. Figure  5.7a shows that the velocity from lateral subsections \n\nwere sometimes higher than the central ones, revealing that spreading of the hot water when \n\nintroduced into the flow had influence in these velocities.

This actually makes sense \n\nbecause the metal slab introduces an obstacle into the stream, forcing the water to split to the \n\nsides, creating a turbulent structure that has its converging point behind the metal slab, which \n\nis aligned with the center of the stream. In addition, results for the slab method were also \n\nmore consistent than the ones that involved adding water to the flow. \n\n \n\n \nFigure ?5.7 - Velocities in the different water front subsections (different runs from each set of experiments, \n\nvalues not multiplied by the correction factor ?) for: a) hot water addition; b) metal slab. \n\n \n\n5.4.2. Leading and Intense Hot Water Fronts \n\nDuring the experiments where hot water was added to the flow, two distinct fronts of hot \n\nwater could be identified. This phenomenon resembles with an aureole of less hot water \n\naround the intense hotter mass of water, as represented in image Figure  5.8. Therefore, two \n\ndistinct velocities can be obtained, one considering the fastest leading front and other \n\nconsidering the most intense front. This aureole is most likely caused by heat losses from the \n\nwater in the edge of the hot water mass, when in contact with the colder water from the \n\nstream. However, it can also be explained by overestimation considerations, assuming that the \n\naureole is caused by heat transfer from the hot water mass to the surrounding water. This \n\naureole was more pronounced when working with lower velocities. \n\nResults from this thesis were obtained considering the leading front. However, both \n\nvelocities were considered for a set of experiments in order to analyze the influence of this \n\noption on velocity measurements. \n\na) b) \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of a method using infrared thermography for 5.

The recorded area \n\nwas divided in three regions of 0.15 m and the velocity in each one of them was measured and \n\nthen represented in the graph. It is observable that the leading front velocity is always higher \n\nthan the intense front.  \n\nFrom previous sets of experiments (computed using a 0.2 m region as explained in \n\nsection  4.3), the estimated flow velocity is similar to the one computed for the last region. The \n\ntendencies shown in Figure  5.10 for different velocities, can be explained by considering that \n\nthe velocity in the first region is highly influenced by the initial velocity induced by the water \n\nspilling, and then as the distance to the point of water addition increases, it starts converging \n\nto the real flow velocity. According to the values from Figure  5.10, this initial velocity is \n\nlikely to be around 15 cm/s. In order to confirm this value, the time of the water addition \n\nprocess was estimated from the recorded images (average of 0.88 seconds) which, when \n\nrelated with the amount of water added (175 ml), allowed the determination of the discharge \n\nfrom the cup (199 cm\n3\n/s).

CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nNowadays, a huge set of options for flow measurement techniques are available, based on the \n\nmost various principles, and for a wide price range. Despite the existence of powerful and \n\nwidely used measurement techniques, there is still space for innovative new techniques to \n\nemerge, especially if they provide new solutions, at an affordable price, for measurements \n\nunder certain unfavorable conditions, for which the use of conventional techniques is usually \n\nlimited (e.g. shallow flows).  \n\nSimilarly, in flow visualization techniques, there are already methods that guarantee \n\nquality in the observation of various processes and that inclusively allow reliable \n\nquantification. Nevertheless, with the sophistication of new imaging techniques, progress in \n\nresearch is expected to continue at a high rate in the next years with the development of more \n\neffective and accurate methods (numerical or experimental) and the improvement of emerging \n\nvisualization techniques (e.g. PIV, BIV) in order to improve spatial and temporal \n\nquantification of the flow. Research on shallow flows is also focusing on determining the \n\nextent to which scale effects influence measuring and flow visualization methods.  \n\nWithin this framework, a technique was outlined and some exploratory experiments were \n\nperformed. The most significant conclusions from the experimental work are listed below: \n\n? Results were in accordance with the velocities obtained using an ADV, however \n\nalways slightly overestimated. \n\n? The technique performed well for multiple slope and depth conditions, under the \n\nexperimented settings used. \n\n? From the tested water heating methods, the heated metal slab and the hot water \n\naddition were the only that could provide analyzable data. The use of the heat gun \n\nsignificantly disturbed the flow, compromising results, while the hot wire didn\u2019t have \n\nadequate power to heat the water enough, thus it was not possible to identify and track \n\na hot water front in the flow. \n\n? It\u2019s preferable to add hot water further upstream from the recorded area in order to \n\nallow time for the hot water to acquire the flow velocity. \n\n? The quantity of added water had influence on the results, with higher quantities \n\ncontributing to an overestimation of velocity. \n\n? Adding water manually originated variability in the results, with relatively high \n\nstandard deviation values, that increased the uncertainty of the measurements. \n\n? Experiments using a metal slab consistently revealed lower standard deviation values, \n\nand provided less overestimated values of velocity. \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of an infrared strobe method for shallow flow CONCLUSIONS \n\nvisualization and quantitative estimation of velocity fields \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 59 \n\n \n\n? The presence of strong turbulence, hydraulic jumps and other situations where the \n\nsurface is significantly disturbed jeopardizes velocity measurement results. It however \n\nrevealed potential of the technique for flow visualization purposes, as turbulent \n\nstructures (e.g. wakes, eddies, vortices) and mixing processes are visible. \n\n? The analysis of three different subsections of the hot water front showed that while in \n\nthe hot water addition experiments the central velocity was usually higher than the \n\nones from the sides, for the metal slab experiments it was lower (water forced to \n\ncontour the slab). \n\n? Experiments revealed the existence of a well-defined lighter aureole around a more \n\nintense hot water mass. The leading front always presented slightly higher velocities \n\nthan the more intense front.  \n\nThe main advantage of the technique relies in the fact that the used tracer is also water, \n\nthus its shares most of the properties of the initial water in the flow, what is crucial for the \n\nsuccess of a tracer. Density is however known to vary with temperature, but it can actually be \n\nan advantage because it contributes for hot water to remain at the surface where it can be \n\nvisualized through thermography. In opposition to dyes or electrolyte tracers, no chemicals \n\nare added to the flow, avoiding problems with environmental concerns. Heat can eventually \n\nhave some negative impact on habitats, but for local single measurements it is hardly \n\nproblematic. In addition, the tendency for the formation of conglomerates on the water surface \n\ndue to surface tension effects is avoided. The portability of thermographic cameras is also an \n\nadvantage as it opens good prospects for uses in the field. Because the method involves \n\nrecordings and posterior image processing, results are not dependent on human reaction, \n\nwhich reduces uncertainty.  \n\nThis technique can be useful especially when dealing with shallow water depths that are \n\ninherently complicated to measure, often colliding with minimum working depths of \n\nequipment (e.g. mechanical current meters), or affected by the inevitable interference of \n\nboundary conditions (e.g. reflection of waves of ADCPs). Also, the technique has no \n\nconstraints regarding the use in the presence of sediments, debris or rock, which is usually a \n\nlimitation for other methods because it may cause damage to the instruments. In cases where \n\nthe flow is inaccessible, this method might still be used, by placing the camera obliquely to \n\nthe flow (in an accessible zone nearby) and by considering a distortion to the images. \n\nThe presented technique is still at an early stage and used inexpensive technology. With \n\nthe development of the present work, it was recognized that it is possible to improve the \n\naccuracy of results. The most noticeable aspect was the added value and research options that \n\nwould be available if a more advanced thermographic camera with higher capacities was \n\nused, since it would provide temperature quantification and higher spatial resolution. Also the \n\ntested water heating methods are still far from the ideal solution for this technique, because \n\n\n\n \n\nDevelopment of an infrared strobe method for shallow flow CONCLUSIONS \n\nvisualization and quantitative estimation of velocity fields \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRui Leal Pedroso de Lima 60 \n\n \n\nlower surface disturbance, less intrusion into the flow and less variability between \n\nexperiments are key points. \n\n \n\nFuture Work \n\nThe technology revealed potential not only for velocity estimation purposes but also for \n\ndistinct approaches. Some proposals and ideas for future studies are listed below: \n\n \n\n? Application at a larger scale. The use of a wider flume would enhance the simulation \n\nof shallow and overland flows, and allow the study of two dimensional processes.  \n\n? Development of more efficient methods to locally heat the water (e.g. more powerful \n\nhot-wire device; heat tape; infrared laser beams). \n\n? Use of a research oriented thermographic camera of higher resolution would open new \n\nprospects and options (e.g. analysis similar to PCA (section  3.2.7), study and \n\nmodeling of heat dispersion processes, study of turbulent mixing characteristics, \n\nassessment of cooling water releases). \n\n? Automatization of procedures, namely the use of a strobe water heating method, \n\nwould eventually allow the continuous measurement of velocity. The image \n\ninterpretation phase can inclusively be programmed in order to make more agile the \n\nprocess of obtaining velocity from the video footages.  \n\n?
