Nos dias de hoje estes bioprocessos assumem uma posi\u00e7\u00e3o fundamental como alternativa aos processos qu\u00edmicos tradicionais. Entre as diversas vantagens associadas ao seu uso pelas ind\u00fastrias qu\u00edmicas, petrol\u00edferas e farmac\u00eauticas destacam-se o seu baixo custo, facilidade de \u201cscale-up\u201d e menor impacto ambiental. Este trabalho reporta dois exemplos de bioprocessos utilizados como alternativa aos processos qu\u00edmicos utilizados pelas ind\u00fastrias petrol\u00edfera e farmac\u00eautica. Na primeira parte deste trabalho foi estudado um bioprocesso alternativo recorrendo ao uso de microrganismos para a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o avan\u00e7ada de petr\u00f3leo. Actualmente, devido aos elevados pre\u00e7os do petr\u00f3leo e \u00e0 sua escassez, as t\u00e9cnicas de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o avan\u00e7ada de petr\u00f3leo tornaram-se muito atractivas. Entre as v\u00e1rias t\u00e9cnicas tem-se destacado o uso da recupera\u00e7\u00e3o avan\u00e7ada de petr\u00f3leo com microrganismos (MEOR), t\u00e9cnica que se fundamenta na estimula\u00e7\u00e3o de microrganismos ind\u00edgenas ou injec\u00e7\u00e3o de cons\u00f3rcios de microrganismos de forma a produzir metab\u00f3litos espec\u00edficos e consequentemente aumentar a quantidade de \u00f3leo recuperado. Nos primeiros cap\u00edtulos deste trabalho descreve-se o isolamento de diversos microrganismos de um \u00f3leo paraf\u00ednico brasileiro e a caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o das suas propriedades tensioactivas e de biodegrada\u00e7\u00e3o. Posteriormente caracterizaram-se as estruturas qu\u00edmicas dos biosurfactantes produzidos. No final desta primeira parte foi avaliada ainda a capacidade de algumas das bact\u00e9rias isoladas na recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do \u00f3leo paraf\u00ednico brasileiro aprisionado em colunas de areia. Na segunda parte deste trabalho apresenta-se um exemplo da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de sistemas de duas fases aquosas ou sistemas bif\u00e1sicos aquosos (ABS) para a extrac\u00e7\u00e3o de antibi\u00f3ticos directamente do meio fermentativo no qual foram produzidos. Neste contexto foram estudados pela primeira vez sistemas de duas fases aquosas constitu\u00eddos por l\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos (LIs) e pol\u00edmeros e onde se determinaram os respectivos diagramas de fase. Os novos ABS surgem como uma metodologia eficaz e economicamente vi\u00e1vel para a extrac\u00e7\u00e3o de diversas biomol\u00e9culas e/ou produtos biol\u00f3gicos. Assim, e tendo como objectivo final a extrac\u00e7\u00e3o de antibi\u00f3ticos de um meio fermentativo, foi estudada a influ\u00eancia de uma vasta gama de l\u00edquidos i\u00f3nicos e pol\u00edmeros na forma\u00e7\u00e3o destes sistemas, bem como o seu efeito na parti\u00e7\u00e3o de diferentes mol\u00e9culas-tipo, como amino\u00e1cidos, alcal\u00f3ides e corantes. Como cap\u00edtulo final apresentase a capacidade destes novos sistemas de duas fases aquosas para extrair o antibi\u00f3tico tetraciclina directamente do meio fermentativo de Streptomyces aureofaciens.\nkeywords\tBioprocesses, microorganisms, microbial enhanced oil recovery, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, biosurfactants, biodegradation, aqueous two-phase systems, aqeuous biphasic systems, biomolecules, ionic liquids, polymers, antibiotics.\nabstract\tBioprocesses use microorganisms or cells in order to produce and/or obtain some desired products. Nowadays these strategies appear as a fundamental alternative to the traditional chemical processes. Amongst the many advantages associated to their use in the chemical, oil or pharmaceutical industries, their low cost, easily scale-up and low environmental impact should be highlighted. This work reports two examples of bioprocesses as alternatives to traditional chemical processes used by the oil and pharmaceutical industries. In the first part of this work it was studied an example of a bioprocess based on the use of microorganisms in enhanced oil recovery. Currently, due to high costs of oil and its scarcity, the enhanced oil recovery techniques become very attractive. Between the available techniques the use of microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been highlighted. This process is based on the stimulation of indigenous microorganisms or by the injection of microorganism consortia to produce specific metabolites and hence increase the amount of oil recovered. In the first chapters of this work the isolation of several microorganisms from samples of paraffinic Brazilian oils is described, and their tensioactive and biodegradability properties are presented. Furthermore, the chemical structures of the biosurfactants produced by those isolates were also characterized. In the final chapter of the first part, the capabilities of some isolated bacteria to enhance the oil recovery of paraffinic Brazilian oils entrapped in sand-pack columns were evaluated. In the second part of this work it was investigated aqueous two-phase systems or aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) as extractive strategies for antibiotics directly from the fermented broth in which they are produced. To this goal, several aqueous two-phase systems composed of ionic liquids (ILs) and polymers were studied for the first time and their phase diagrams were determined. The novel ATPS appear as effective and economic methods to extract different biomolecules or/and biological products. Thus, aiming the initial antibiotics extraction purpose it was studied the influence of a wide range of ILs and polymers in the aqueous two-phase formation ability, as well as their influence in the partitioning of several type-molecules, such as amino acids, alkaloids and dyes. As a final chapter it is presented the capacity of these novel systems to extract the antibiotic tetracycline directly from the fermented broth of Streptomyces aureofaciens.\nCONTENTS\nContents\ti\nNotation\tv\nList of Figures\txiii\nList of Tables\txix\nDocument Organization\txxii\nPART A - Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery\t1\n1.\tINTRODUCTION\t3\n1.1.\tGeneral Context\t5\n1.2.\tEnhancement of Oil Production\tand Recovery\t5\n1.3.\tMicrobial Enhanced Oil Recovery\t6\n1.4.\tWork Aims and Motivation\t8\n1.5.\tReferences\t11\n2.\tPAPER 1- Isolation and Study of Microorganisms from Oil\nSamples for Application in Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery\t15\n3.\tPAPER 2 - Characterization by Electrospray Ionization and\nTandem Mass Spectrometry of Rhamnolipids Produced by Two\nPseudomonas aeruginosa Strains Isolated from Brazilian Crude Oil\t41\n4.\tPAPER 3 - Optimization and Characterization of Biosurfactant\nProduction by Bacillus subtilis Isolates Towards Microbial\nEnhanced Oil Recovery Applications\t57\n5.\tPAPER 4 - Biosurfactant Producing Microorganisms and its\nApplication to Enhance Oil Recovery at Lab Scale\t83\n6.\tPAPER 5 - Biosurfactant-Producing and Oil-Degrading Bacillus subtilis Strains Enhance Oil Recovery in Laboratory Sand-Pack\nColumns\t97\n7.\tCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\t117\nPART B - Antibiotics Purification Using Aqueous Biphasic Systems Composed of Ionic Liquids and Polymers\n8.\tINTRODUCTION\t123\n8.1.\tGeneral Context\t125\n8.2.\tAntibiotics\t126\n8.3.\tAqueous Biphasic Systems\t126\n8.4.\tIonic Liquids\t127\n8.5.\tWork Aims and Motivation\t130\n8.6.\tReferences\t137\n9.\tPAPER 6 - Ionic Liquids as Adjuvants for the Tailored Extraction\nof Biomolecules in Aqueous Biphasic Systems\t139\n10.\tPAPER 7 - Insights into the Interactions that Control the Phase\nBehavior of Novel Aqueous Biphasic Systems Composed of Polyethylene Glycols and Ionic Liquids\t165\n11.\tPAPER 8 - \u201cWashing-out\u201d in Polyethylene Glycol + Ionic Liquid\nMixtures to form Aqueous Biphasic Systems\t189\n12.\tPAPER 9 - Combining Ionic Liquids and Polyethylene Glycols to Boost the Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic Range of Aqueous Biphasic\nSystems\t205\n13.\tPAPER 10 - Aqueous Biphasic Systems composed of Ionic Liquids\nand Polymers: A Platform for the Purification of Biomolecules\t217\n14.\tPAPER 11 - Biocompatible Aqueous Biphasic Systems Composed\nof Polyethylene Glycol and Cholinium-based Ionic Liquids:\nTowards the Understanding of Their Formation Ability\t237\n15.\tPAPER 12 - Extraction of Tetracycline from Fermentation Broth using Aqueous Two-Phase Systems Composed of Polyethylene\nGlycol and Cholinium-based Salts\t257\n16.\tCONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK\t275\n18.

Introduction\n4\n1.1.\tGeneral Context\nNowadays there is an increasing attention given to the increment of oil production through enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques. The interest on these techniques results from the oil prices rising and their scarcity. Amongst the main EOR techniques, the microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been experiencing a growing exploitation. The MEOR can be based on the indigenous microorganism\u2019s stimulation or on the injection of microbial consortia into the reservoir to produce specific metabolites, aiming at increasing the oil recovery. The first part of this thesis aims at the study of different indigenous microorganisms with abilities to degrade hydrocarbons, to produce biocompounds with tensioactive and emulsifying properties, and their application in MEOR.\n1.2.\tEnhancement of Oil Production and Recovery\nThe world population is expected to grow about 45% in the next 3 decades. This increase, coupled with higher energy consumption per person, is bound to lead to an energy demand that will suffer a steady increase over the next years1. This poses the question: How will we meet this increased energy needs? Broadly, more than 80% of the world\u2019s energy comes from the fossil fuels, half of which being obtained from oil . Actually the use of alternative energies (such as solar, hydric and wind) are increasing. However, these are expected to meet only 10% of the world\u2019s population needs , so that we will remain dependent on fossil energies in the near future.\nAmong the fossil energies, the oil appears as the essential source of energy and one of the main factors driving the economic development of the World. Its recovery comprises a primary phase, where oil and gas are produced using the natural pressure drive of the reservoir; and a secondary phase, which involves the stimulation of the oil wells by the injection of fluids to improve the flow of oil and gas to the well-head4. While primary recovery produces 5-10% of the original oil in place, recovery efficiencies in the secondary stage range from 10% to 40%5. Therefore, the remaining crude oil in the reservoirs, after the conventional oil recovery operations, makes up to two-thirds of the total oil reserves6-8. The main factors responsible for the poor oil recovery from producing wells are the low permeability of some reservoirs, the high viscosity of the oil and the high interfacial tension between the hydrocarbon and\naqueous phases, which result in high capillary forces that entrap oil in small pores within the reservoir5, 6. As the price of petroleum increases and petroleum reserves shrink, exploitation of oil resources in mature reservoirs is essential for meeting future energy demands. In the last years, more attention has been focused on tertiary recovery techniques, known as Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (CEOR), to mobilize entrapped oil5, 6, 9\nThe EOR processes have been applied successfully in several countries, such as USA, Canada, China and Middle East, among others4.Traditionally, the chemical methods include the use of surfactants, polymers, acids, gases and solvents4. Surfactants reduce the interfacial tension between the oil-water and oil-rock interfaces decreasing thus the capillary forces that prevent the oil movement through the rock pores; they also alter the wettability of the reservoir rock. Polymers are used to increase the viscosity of water in water-flooding operations and also enhance the effectiveness of the process. Furthermore, polymers plug oil-depleted zones, directing the water-flood to oil-rich channels to release residual oil. Acids are used to increase the permeability through the porous network. Gases and solvents decrease oil viscosity and promote its flow; gases also increase the pressure in the reservoir. It is generally accepted that about 30% of the oil contained in the reservoirs can be recovered using current CEOR technology10. In spite of its efficacy, these methods increase the oil production costs, and also present several environmental hazards such as the high discharge of undesirable residues in aquatic environments.\n1.3.\tMicrobial Enhanced Oil Recovery\nMicrobial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) is an important tertiary oil recovery technology that represents a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative to CEOR. In MEOR, selected microbial strains are used to synthesize compounds analogous to those used in CEOR processes to increase the recovery of oil from depleted and marginal reservoirs, thereby extending their life. MEOR has a potential to be a less expensive process when compared with CEOR because microorganisms can synthesize useful products by fermenting low-cost substrates or raw materials. Furthermore, microbial products are biodegradable and have low toxicity4, 7 11.\nThe microorganisms can promote the enhanced oil recovery using different mechanisms: CO2 production that lead to an increase of the reservoir pressure and a reduction of the oil viscosity; production of acids that dissolve certain rocks, increasing therefore the reservoir permeability; blocking of reservoir channels through the biopolymers and biomass produced, which favours the oil displacement; in situ or ex situ biosurfactants and/or emulsifiers production that allow the reduction of oil/water/rock interfacial tension and the oil emulsification; and reduction of the oil viscosity by the biodegradation of the heavier saturated hydrocarbons fractions . Although all these processes can be useful to MEOR applications, their relative efficiencies depend on each reservoir characteristics, being the microorganism strains, nutrients media and injection processes relevant in every case . The common microorganisms with higher potential to be applied in MEOR are the following species: Clostridium acetobutylicumn, Pseudomonas aeruginosa^, Bacillus15, Brevibacillus, Rhizobium e Nocardia16. The use of these strains can be done by two different approaches: the injection and inoculation of these strains in the reservoir; and the nutritional stimulation in situ of the indigenous strains naturally present in the\n\u2022\t17\nreservoirs .\nAmong the several MEOR techniques, biosurfactant MEOR represents one of the most promising methods to recover a substantial proportion of the residual oil from mature oil fields ,\t. Biosurfactants are a heterogeneous group of surface-active molecules\nproduced by microorganisms, with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, and which allow them to partition at the interface between the fluid phases with different degrees of polarity, such as oil-water or air-water interfaces. Due to these properties, biosurfactants reduce the surface and interfacial tension and form stable emulsions where hydrocarbons can be dispersed in water7, 11, 19, 20. Biosurfactants produced by some microorganisms are capable of generating a low interfacial tension between the hydrocarbon and the aqueous phases required to mobilize entrapped oil , ,\t. These\ncompounds are good candidates for application in MEOR processes and can efficiently replace synthetic surfactants due to their specific activity, low toxicity, high biodegradability and effectiveness at extreme conditions of temperature, pressure, pH and salinity , - . Similarly to other MEOR mechanisms, there are also two strategies that can be adopted for the use of biosurfactants in enhanced oil recovery. Biosurfactants can be produced ex-situ and subsequently injected into the reservoir; or\nthey can be produced in situ by indigenous or injected microorganisms, stimulated by the addition of selected nutrients into the well. The first approach is expensive due to the capital required for the bioreactors operation, product purification and introduction into oil-containing rocks. The second option is more favourable from an economic point of view, but requires the use of microorganisms capable of producing sufficient amounts of biosurfactant within the reservoir4, n.\nAnother important mechanism of MEOR is the use of microorganisms to degrade heavy oil fractions. As a result, the oil viscosity decreases and it becomes more fluid, lighter and more valuable. In some cases, combining multiple mechanisms by using consortia of microorganisms with different properties (ability to degrade heavy oil fractions and biosurfactant production) may be an effective strategy for enhanced oil recovery26. There are a number of microorganisms able to degrade hydrocarbons using them as carbon sources . During the last decade interesting results for the microbial n-alkane\n28 32\ndegradation have been reported - . In particular, strains of Gordonia amicalis have shown ability to degrade large n-alkanes under aerobic and anaerobic conditions ; Pseudomonas fluorescens are capable of degrading hydrocarbons with chain lengths between C12 and C3234; heavier n-alkanes (C36 to C40) can be degraded by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains ; and a thermophilic Bacillus strain that degraded long-chain (C15-C36) but not short-chain (C8-C14) n-alkanes36 has also been reported. The use of biosurfactant-producing indigenous Bacillus strains to degrade the higher fractions of crude oil and enhance its flow characteristics has been also studied in a petroleum reservoir in the Daqing Oilfield .\nSeveral scientific and technical reports have demonstrated the MEOR successful applicability in oil reservoirs , being estimated that until 2015 up to one third of the EOR may be based in microbial processes5.\n1.4.\tWork aims and Motivation\nIn the past few years Brazil has achieved its highest rate of oil production. However, according to the Oil Production report from Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Petr\u00f3leo (ANP) only 8% of it are light oil, being 39% of the crude oil produced considered heavy oil. Thus, in our work, we have been aiming at the study of the application of MEOR processes to a paraffinic heavier oil in collaboration with the Biological Engineering Department\n(University of Minho), and the reservoir operator PARTEX Oil and Gas. For that purpose, four different oil samples, with high pour point and gravity of 25\u00b0 API, and with very low solution gas, were supplied by the operator. The samples were obtained from reservoirs consisting of sands with an average porosity of 25% and a permeability of 50 mD. Initially, on chapter 2, we will show the isolation of several microorganisms directly from oil samples, and the study of their ability to produce compounds with surface-active and emulsifying properties and to degrade the higher \u00ab-alkanes fractions. To this end it was studied the isolation and growth in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, the biosurfactant production by those isolates, and the degradation of wax paraffinic mixtures by the isolates with higher biosurfactant-production rates. By the isolation of several strains, Bacillus subtilis and two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified. On chapter 3 and 4, the chemical characterization of the biosurfactants produced by the strains P. aeruginosa and B. subtilis is then presented. In chapter 3 two mixtures of ramnolipids produced by two different strains of P.aeruginosa are characterized using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (XH NMR) and Mass Spectrometry (MS). On chapter 4 three different surfactant mixtures produced by three B. subtilis isolates were also characterized using 'h NMR, MS and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The optimization of the nitrogen and carbon sources in order to maximize the biosurfactant production and the study of the biosurfactants ability to influence the interfacial tension of water/oil systems were also evaluated. After the characterization and study of the biosurfactants production, chapter 5 is focused on the study of the capacities of five different strains to produce compounds with emulsifying and surface-active properties, in a medium supplemented with hydrocarbons, and also on their abilities to degrade paraffinic mixtures and to mobilize liquid paraffin entrapped in sand-pack columns increasing its recovery. Finally and having in mind the main goal of this first part of the thesis, chapter 6 is focused on the MEOR laboratory studies using sand-pack columns applying three B. subtilis strains previously isolated. It was investigated the effect of these isolates on the mobilization of four different hydrocarbon mixtures (heating oil, viscous paraffin, Arabian light crude oil, and heavy crude oil) entrapped in sand-pack columns, and on the degradation of the oils recovered after the microbial treatment.\nAs mentioned above this work was developed in collaboration with the Biological Engineering Department of University of Minho, Portugal. In the Chemistry\nDepartment of University of Aveiro, the biodegradation assays, oil densities and viscosities analysis, chemical characterization of the biosurfactants, and part of the sand-pack enhanced oil recovery tests (these tests were performed by both research groups) were carried out.\n1.5.\tReferences\n1.\tHall, C.T., P., Hallock, J.

Stimulation of bacterial growth for biosurfactant production and degradation of heavy oil fractions by indigenous microorganisms can enhance the fluidity and reduce the capillary forces that retain the oil into the reservoir. MEOR offers major advantages over conventional EOR techniques, namely low energy consumption and independence of the price of crude oil. In this work, the isolation and identification of microorganisms capable of producing biosurfactants and promote degradation of long-chain \u00ab-alkanes under conditions existent in oil reservoirs was addressed. Among the isolated microorganisms, five Bacillus strains were able to produce extracellular biosurfactants at 40\u00b0C under anaerobic conditions in a medium supplemented with hydrocarbons. Three isolates were selected as the higher biosurfactant producers. The obtained biosurfactants reduced the surface tension of water from 72 to 30 mN.m-1, exhibited emulsifying activity and were not affected by their exposure to high temperatures (121\u00b0C). These characteristics make them good candidates for use at conditions usually existing in oil reservoirs. Furthermore, it was here shown, for the first time, that Bacillus strains were able to degrade large alkyl chains and to reduce the viscosity of hydrocarbon mixtures under anaerobic conditions. The results obtained show that the isolated microorganisms are promising candidates for the development of enhanced oil recovery processes.\nKeywords: MEOR; Biosurfactant; Hydrocarbon; Degradation; Bacillus, Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery.\n2.2.\tIntroduction\nAs described in Chapter 1, fossil oil is an essential source of energy and one of the main factors driving the economic development of the World, whereas its recovery comprises three different phases (primary, secondary and tertiary). The remaining crude oil in the reservoirs after conventional oil recovery operations makes up to two-thirds of the total oil reserves - . In the last years the tertiary recovery techniques have received a huge attention and this chapter considers the Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR)\napplicability aiming at mobilizing the entrapped oil and enhancing the oil productivity1, 4, 5\nAmong the several techniques applied in MEOR, the use of microorganisms with ability to produce biosurfactants and/or to degrade the heavy oil fractions are two of the most promising platforms to increase the production of the residual oil from mature oil fields6, 7 The first can be carried out by two main strategies: 1) Biosurfactants can be produced ex-situ and subsequently injected into the reservoir; 2) Biosurfactants can be produced in situ by indigenous or injected microorganisms stimulated by the addition of selected nutrients into the well. From the two strategies, the in situ approach is more favourable from an economical point of view; however, dependent on a sufficient biosurfactant productivity6, 8. The second technique consists in the use of microorganisms with biodegradation ability in order to decrease the oil viscosity turning it more fluid, lighter and more valuable. Oftentimes, the combination of the multiple mechanisms by using consortia of microorganisms with different properties (ability to degrade heavy oil fractions and biosurfactant production) may be an effective strategy for enhanced oil recovery9. Recently, a combination of both techniques, with the use of biosurfactant-producing indigenous Bacillus strains able to degrade the higher fractions of crude oil, was studied with a petroleum reservoir in the Daqing Oilfield10 aiming the enhancement of its flow characteristics.\nThe main drawback of MEOR is the difficulty of isolating microorganisms that can grow and produce the desired metabolic products under the environmental conditions that usually exist in oil reservoirs; many reservoirs are anaerobic and have high salinities and temperatures. Since few environmental parameters of the reservoirs can be manipulated, this also limits the number of reservoirs where microorganisms can be used for in situ treatment. Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis strains have been isolated repeatedly from oil reservoirs meaning that they are able to tolerate the reservoir conditions5, 7 11-14\nIn this work, several microorganisms were isolated from crude oil samples and screened for anaerobic growth, biosurfactant production and ability to degrade heavy oil fractions, in order to obtain suitable candidates for application in MEOR.\n2.3.\tMaterials and Methods\n2.3.1.\tIsolation of Microorganisms from Oil Samples\nCrude oil samples obtained from four wells (PTX-3, PTX-8, PTX-9 and PTX-11) of a Brazilian oil field were collected in sterile bottles. The temperature of the reservoir is about 40\u00b0C. Samples were stored at room temperature until use. For isolation of microorganisms, two different methods were used. Direct isolation was performed by serially diluting crude oil samples, that were plated on agar solidified Bushnell-Hass medium and Raymond medium (containing 1% (v/v) n-hexadecane as the sole carbon source), as well as Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Plates were incubated both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions at different temperatures. Enrichment cultures were prepared in 500 mL glass bottles containing 250 mL of mineral media (Bushnell-Hass medium and Raymond medium) supplemented with 1% (v/v) n-hexadecane as the sole carbon source. Crude oil samples (5 mL) were transferred to the bottles and incubated at 37, 42 and 50\u00b0C for one month. To isolate bacterial strains, samples (200 pL) of the enrichment cultures were periodically spread on agar plates that were incubated at 37, 42 and 50\u00b0C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. After incubation, morphologically distinct colonies were re-isolated by transfer to fresh agar plates, at least three times, to obtain pure cultures. Isolate purity was verified through microscopic observation of Gram stained cultures. Pure cultures were stored at -80\u00b0C in LB medium containing 20% (v/v) of a glycerol aqueous solution.\nThe composition of Raymond medium was as follows (g.L-1): NaCl 50.0; Na2HPO4 3.0; NH4NO3 2.0; KH2PO4 2.0; yeast extract 0.5; MgSO<7H2O 0.2; Na2CO3 0.1; MnSO4'4H2O 0.02; CaCl2 0.01; FeSO4 0.01; supplemented with 1% (v/v) n-hexadecane. The composition of Bushnell-Hass medium was (g.L-1): KH2PO4 1.0; K2HPO4 1.0; NH4NO3 1.0; MgSO4'7H2O 0.2; FeCls 0.05; CaCl2 0.02; supplemented with 1% (v/v) n-hexadecane. The composition of the LB medium was (g.L-1): NaCl 10.0; tryptone 10.0; yeast extract 5.0. All the media were adjusted to pH 7.0.\n2.3.2.\tScreening of Biosurfactant-producing Strains\nLB medium was used to study biosurfactant production by the different bacterial isolates. A single colony of each isolate was taken from the plate and transferred to 30 mL of LB liquid medium; cultures were incubated at 40\u00b0C and 120 rpm. Growth and\nbiosurfactant production were examined under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Anaerobic cultures were prepared removing oxygen by aseptically bubbling oxygen-free nitrogen into the flasks, which were sealed with rubber stoppers.\nSamples were taken at different time points during the fermentation to determine biomass concentration and biosurfactant production. Bacterial growth was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged (10000 x g, 20 min, 10\u00b0C) and cell-free supernatants were used to measure surface tension and emulsifying activity. At the end of the fermentation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and the cell dry weight (g.L-1) was determined (48 h at 105\u00b0C).\n2.3.3.\tGrowth and Biosurfactant Production in Mineral Media\nThe bacterial strains were grown in 30 mL of different mineral media (medium E and Mineral Salt Solution with and without n-hexadecane (1%, v/v)) at 40\u00b0C. The composition of Medium E was (g.L-1): NaCl 50.0; K2HPO4 10.6; sucrose 10.0; KH2PO4 5.3; (NH4)2SO4 1.0; MgSO4-7H2O 0.25; supplemented with 1% (v/v) of trace salt solution. The trace salt solution contained (g.L-1): MnSO4-4H2O 3.0; EDTA 1.0; FeSO4'7H2O 0.1; CaCl2'2H2O 0.1; CoCh^^O 0.1; ZnSO4'7H2O 0.1; CuSO4'5H2O\n0.01; AlK(SO4)2-12H2O 0.01; H3BO3 0.01; Na2MoO4-2H2O 0.01. The Mineral Salt Solution consisted of (g.L-1): NaCl 10.0; sucrose 10.0; Na2HPO4 5.0; NH4NO3 2.0; KH2PO4 2.0; MgSO4-4H2O 0.2. Both media were adjusted to pH 7.0.\n2.3.4.\tBiosurfactant Production and Isolation\nBiosurfactant production was carried out in shake flasks containing 500 mL of LB medium. Each flask was inoculated with 5 mL of a pre-culture that was prepared using the same culture medium and incubated overnight at the optimum conditions established for each isolate. The flasks were then incubated at the same conditions until the stationary phase was reached. At the end of the fermentation, cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 x g, 20 min, 10\u00b0C) and the cell dry weight (g.L-1) was determined (48 h at 105 \u00b0C). To recover the biosurfactant, the cell free supernatant was subjected to acid precipitation. Briefly, the supernatant was adjusted to pH 2.0 with HCl 6 M and left overnight at 4\u00b0C. Afterwards, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (10000 x g, 20 min, 4\u00b0C) and washed twice with acidified water (pH 2.0). The crude biosurfactant was dissolved in a minimal amount of demineralised water and the pH was adjusted to\n7.0 using NaOH 1 M. Finally, the crude biosurfactant solution was freeze-dried and stored at -20\u00b0C for further use.\n2.3.5.\tSurface-activity Determination\nSurface tension measurements of culture broth supernatants and biosurfactant solutions were performed according to the Du Nouy ring method described elsewhere15. A KRUSS K6 Tensiometer (KRUSS GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a 1.9 cm Du Nouy platinum ring was used. To increase the accuracy of the surface tension measurements, an average of triplicate determinations was conducted. All the measurements were performed at room temperature (20\u00b0C). Isolates which reduced the culture broth surface tension, below 40 mN.m-1, were considered biosurfactant producers.\n2.3.6.\tEmulsifying Activity Determination\nEmulsifying activity was determined by the addition of 2 mL of n-hexadecane to the same volume of cell-free culture broth supernatant or biosurfactant solution in glass test tubes. The tubes were vortex mixed at high speed for 2 min and then incubated at 25\u00b0C for 24 h. The stability of the emulsion was determined after 24 h, and the emulsification index (E24) was calculated as the percentage of the height of the emulsified layer (mm) divided by the total height of the liquid column (mm). Emulsions formed by the different isolates were compared with those formed by a 1% (w/v) solution of the synthetic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) in demineralised water, as proposed by Das et al.16. All emulsification indexes were performed in triplicate.\n2.3.7.\tCritical Micelle Concentration (cmc)\nCritical micelle concentration is the concentration of an amphiphilic component in solution at which the formation of micelles is initiated. Concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 5 g.L-1 of the crude biosurfactants recovered from the different isolates were prepared in PBS (10 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 and 150 mM NaCl with pH adjusted to 7.0) and the surface tension of each sample was determined by the Du Nouy ring method at room temperature (20\u00b0C) as previously described. The cmc was determined by plotting the surface tension as a function of the logarithm of biosurfactant concentration and it\nwas found at the point of intersection between the two lines that best fit through the pre-and post-cmc data. All measurements were done in triplicate.\n2.3.8.\tIdentification of the Isolates\nBacterial isolates that displayed high biosurfactant production were selected and identified by partial 16S rRNA sequencing. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using primers 341F and 907R. The resulting sequences were compared with sequences in the GenBank database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using the nucleotide-nucleotide blast (BLASTn) network service, to determine their phylogenetic affiliations.\n2.3.9.\tStability Studies\nThe effect of several environmental parameters on the activity of biosurfactants produced by the different isolates was determined. Stability studies were performed using the cell-free broth obtained by centrifuging the cultures at 10,000 x g for 20 min. In order to assess the effect of salinity on biosurfactant activity, the culture broth supernatants were supplemented with different NaCl concentrations (from 10 to 200 g.L-1) and the surface tension was measured as described above. To evaluate the stability of the biosurfactants to high temperatures, broth samples were incubated at 121\u00b0C for 20 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. Surface tension and emulsification indexes were measured and compared to the corresponding values before heat treatment. The pH stability was studied by adjusting the cell-free broth to different pH values (2.0-13.0) using HCl or NaOH solutions, and then surface tension values were measured as described above. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate.\n2.3.10.\tGrowth at Different Temperatures and Salinities\nIn addition to the lack of oxygen, temperature and salinity appear to be the most important environmental factors that influence bacterial growth in the reservoir. Therefore, media containing different NaCl concentrations (0-200 g.L-1) were used to grow the isolated bacteria and cultures were incubated at temperatures ranging from 40\u00b0C to 60\u00b0C for different time intervals.\n2.3.11.\tHydrocarbon Degradation Determination\nThe ability of the isolated microorganisms to degrade paraffinic mixtures under aerobic and anaerobic conditions was evaluated using two different experimental conditions. In the first experimental condition used, YP medium supplemented with a paraffinic mixture A (containing n-alkanes between C14-C24) was used. In the second condition, Mineral salt Medium (MSM) and a heavier paraffinic mixture B (containing n-alkanes between C20-C30) were used. The mixture A was prepared in order to make a preliminary assessment of the degradation ability of 5 different strains. The mixture B was prepared in order to evaluate the ability of 6 different strains to degrade heavier n-alkanes chains under anaerobic conditions, aiming the possibility of application on Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery.\nThe composition of YP medium was (g.L-1): peptone 20.0; yeast extract 10.0. The MSM contained (g.L-1): KH2PO4 4.7; KNO3 4.0; MgSO^4H2O 1.0; Na2HPO4 0.119; FeSO4.7H2O 0.015; CaCl^HiO 0.01; MnCM^O 0.01. MSM was used to evaluate the degradation of n-alkanes by the different isolates in medium without additional carbon sources, since YP medium contains peptone and yeast extract, which can be used as carbon sources by the microorganisms.\nFlasks containing 50 mL of each culture media supplemented with 10% (w/v) of the respective sterile paraffinic mixture were prepared. The flasks were sealed with rubber stoppers. Anaerobic cultures were prepared removing oxygen by aseptically bubbling oxygen-free nitrogen into the flasks. The paraffinic mixture A was composed by a ratio of 3:1 of two synthetic liquid paraffins, RT20 and RT31, obtained from Rubitherm (Rubitherm GmbH, Berlin, Germany). Culture media were supplemented with 1% (w/v) of squalane (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, USA), in order to evaluate the ability of the strains to degrade ramified hydrocarbons. The mixture B was prepared with 23% (w/w) of solid paraffin wax with a melting point of 50-52\u00b0C (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich), dissolved in dodecane (99% of purity, also from Sigma-Aldrich). Cultures were performed at 40\u00b0C and 150 rpm during 4 days under aerobic conditions, and during 15 days in anaerobic conditions. Control flasks were incubated at the same conditions without addition of microorganisms.\nAfter the incubation time, the organic phase was separated and diluted (20 mg.mL-1) in dichloromethane for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. The GC analysis of each sample was performed with a CP 3800 Varian gas Chromatograph equipped with an on-column injection, FID detector, and DB-5HT capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm i.d., 0.1 pm thickness) (J&amp;W Scientific Inc., California, USA). Helium was used as gas carrier and a constant flow rate of 2 mL.min-1 was set. The injector and detector temperatures were 350\u00b0C and 370\u00b0C, respectively. The oven temperature was set at 50\u00b0C during 1 min, raised to 350\u00b0C at the rate of 10\u00b0C.min-1, and at last kept at 370\u00b0C during 1 min. All the samples were analyzed in triplicate.\n2.4.\tResults and Discussion\n2.4.1.\tIsolation of Microorganisms from Oil Samples\nWhen petroleum samples were spread on agar plates and incubated at different temperatures, no isolates were obtained, neither under aerobic nor anaerobic conditions. However, using the enrichment method, a total of fifty-eight bacterial strains were recovered. The results obtained are summarized in Table 2.1.\nTable 2.1 Number of isolates obtained from the different oil samples at different temperatures and results obtained regarding biosurfactant production from the screening process under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.\nSample\tNumber of isolates\t\t\t\t1 Biosurfactant production 1\t\n\t37\u00b0C\t42\u00b0C\t50\u00b0C\tTotal\t\u25a0 Aerobic\tAnaerobic\nPTX-3\t3\t3\t14\t20\t! 8\t2\nPTX-8\t3\t11\t7\t21\t! !2\t0\nPTX-9\t2\t3\t3\t8\t! 2\t0\nPTX-11\t2\t1\t6\t9\t! 8\t3\nTotal\t10\t18\t30\t58\t!\t30\t5\n2.4.2.\tScreening of Biosurfactant-producing Strains\nThe different isolates were screened for extracellular biosurfactant production in LB medium under aerobic and anaerobic conditions at 40\u00b0C. To evaluate biosurfactant production, both the surface tension and emulsifying activity were taken into account. However, only those isolates that reduced surface tension were found to exhibit\nemulsifying activity (no bioemulsifier production was detected). Under aerobic conditions, thirty of the fifty-eight isolates reduced the culture medium surface tension below 40 mN.m-1, and therefore were considered biosurfactant producers. From these, only five isolates produced biosurfactants also under anaerobic conditions (Table 2.1). The most relevant results obtained are shown in Table 2.2.\nBiosurfactants produced by isolates #111 and #902 showed the highest emulsifying activity against \u00ab-hexadecane, similar to the one obtained with the synthetic surfactant SDS. However, surface tension values obtained with those isolates were not as low as the obtained with other isolates. Furthermore, although isolates #111 and #902 grew at anaerobic conditions, no surface tension reduction or emulsifying activity could be observed, which hampers their application in MEOR processes in situ, since most oil reservoirs are anaerobic. The other isolates described in Table 2.2 produced biosurfactants under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. However, biomass and biosurfactant production were higher under aerobic conditions for all the isolates, which is in agreement with the results obtained by other authors - ,\t. Isolates #309, #311\nand #573 showed the highest surface activity, reducing the surface tension of the culture broth from 51.3 mN.m-1 to values around 30 mN.m-1, and emulsified n-hexadecane similarly to SDS. Isolates #309 and #311 were identified as the best biosurfactant producers under anaerobic conditions. In addition, emulsions formed by supernatants obtained from isolates #111, #309, #311, #573 and #902 remained stable for two weeks at 25\u00b0C.\nTable 2.2 Surface tension values (mN.m-1), emulsification indexes (E24, %) and biomass concentrations (g.L-1) obtained with the different isolates grown aerobically and anaerobically in LB medium at 40\u00b0C. Surface tension (ST) values were determined at room temperature (20\u00b0C). Emulsification indexes were calculated at 25\u00b0C. Biomass concentration was calculated as the dry weight (105\u00b0C, 48 h).

The sequences obtained were compared with those described in databases. The partial sequence of 16S rRNA genes from isolates #111 and #902 showed 100% similarity with P. aeruginosa. The partial sequence of 16S rRNA genes of the remaining isolates showed 100% similarity with B. subtilis. The sequences were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers JQ281104-JQ281110.\n2.4.4.\tStudy of Biosurfactant Production in Mineral Media\nThe isolates presenting the best results regarding biosurfactant production in LB medium were then evaluated under anaerobic conditions using Mineral Salt Solution (MSS), Mineral Salt Solution supplemented with 1% (v/v) n-hexadecane (MSSH) and medium E. The results obtained are gathered in Table 2.3. As can be seen from these results, the MSS (with and without n-hexadecane) offered better results than medium E for all the isolates. Addition of n-hexadecane to the culture broth was found to promote a higher biosurfactant production by some isolates and had no effect on the others. None of the isolates was able to grow or produce biosurfactants in MSS using n-hexadecane as the sole carbon source (data not shown). The lowest surface tension values (around 30 mN.m-1) were obtained by isolates #309, #311 and #573, with emulsifying indexes between 24% and 34%.\nSeveral P. aeruginosa strains have been recovered from petroleum samples and oil contaminated places, and their biosurfactants exhibit good characteristics for application in MEOR, as demonstrated by simulations performed in sand-pack columns - . However, those isolates were studied under aerobic conditions and the biosurfactants were produced ex-situ. Therefore, although the authors suggested their possible use in MEOR, these strains are not appropriate for use in oil reservoirs. Most of the microorganisms that are potentially useful for application in MEOR in situ belong to the genus Bacillus. Bacillus mojavensis JF-2, a thermotolerant and halotolerant strain isolated from an oil field by Jenneman and collaborators11, grows and produces similar amounts of a lipopeptide biosurfactant under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, reducing the surface tension of the medium below 30 mN.m-1, and additionally it is not\n11, 21\ninhibited by crude oil , . Other strains isolated from oil fields and which applicability in MEOR has been demonstrated are B. licheniformis BAS50 ,\t, B. licheniformis\nACO113 and B. subtilis PTCC169614. Biosurfactants produced by those microorganisms recovered 22-60% of the residual oil entrapped in sand-packed columns2, 13, 17, 20. Furthermore, Youssef et al. demonstrated that inoculation of oil wells with Bacillus strains and nutrients is possible, and that biosurfactants can be produced in situ at concentrations that are sufficient to mobilize significant amount of residual oil. Taking into account these data and the results obtained with isolates #309, #311 and #573 regarding biosurfactant production, they can be considered good candidates for application in MEOR.\nTable 2.3 Surface tension values (mN.m-1), emulsification indexes (E24, %) and biomass concentrations (g.L-1) obtained with the different isolates grown in different media for 120 h at 40\u00b0C and 120 rpm under anaerobic conditions. Surface tension (ST) values were determined six times at room temperature (20\u00b0C). Emulsification indexes were calculated three times at 25\u00b0C.

B. subtilis isolates (#191, #309, #311, #552 and #573) were able to grow at temperatures between 40 and 55\u00b0C in solid medium. At 45\u00b0C they grew at NaCl concentrations up to 100 g.L-1. Isolates #309 and #311 grew at 50\u00b0C in liquid medium, and biosurfactant production was similar to the obtained at 40\u00b0C. However, isolates #191, #552 and #573 were unable to grow in liquid medium at temperatures higher than 45\u00b0C. Similar results with several Bacillus strains have been reported by other authors11-14, 17, 21. For P. aeruginosa isolates #111 and #902 no growth was observed at temperatures higher than 42\u00b0C neither in liquid or solid media.\n2.4.6.\tHydrocarbon Degradation\nAlthough the use of Bacillus strains for biosurfactant production has been widely described in the literature, their use to degrade n-alkanes has seldom been addressed. In order to evaluate the ability of the isolated B. subtilis strains to degrade n-alkanes, two different paraffinic mixtures (A and B) were used. The mixture A was incubated with isolates #191, #551, #571, #572 and #573 under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The respective variations of relative weight fraction of each n-alkane present in mixture A compared with the control sample (incubated at the same conditions without microorganisms) are illustrated in Figures 2.1 and 2.2.\nFigure 2.1 Variation of relative weight fraction of n-alkanes present in paraffinic mixture A after incubation with bacterial isolates, for 4 days at 40\u00b0C and aerobic conditions as compared to the control. (SQL: squalane).\nvariation\nFigure 2.2 Variation of relative weight fraction of n-alkanes present in paraffinic mixture A after incubation with bacterial isolates, for 15 days at 40\u00b0C and anaerobic conditions as compared to the control. (SQL: squalane).\nThe isolates studied were found to be able to grow in YP medium supplemented with paraffinic mixture A, both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The increase observed in the relative weight fraction of n-alkanes lower than C18 and the decrease\nobserved in the percentage of n-alkanes between C18 and C20 after treatment with isolates #191, #551, #571, #572 and #573 indicates that those isolates degraded n-alkanes between C18 and C20 into lighter ones, both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. In the presence of oxygen, isolates #191 and #551 were able to degrade also n-alkanes higher than C20. Comparing the influence of oxygen on the degradation of n-alkanes by the different isolates, significant differences were only observed for isolates #191 and #571. Isolate #191 showed a higher ability to degrade the long chain n-alkanes (C18-C24) under aerobic conditions; however, in absence of oxygen it was only able to degrade n-octadecane and n-nonadecane. On other hand, isolate #571 exhibited an opposite behaviour and better results were obtained under anaerobic conditions. For the remaining isolates, similar degradation values were obtained in both conditions. The experiments also showed that all the isolates were able to degrade ramified hydrocarbons (squalane) either with or without oxygen.\nIn view of the positive results obtained, the anaerobic degradation in a mineral medium where the hydrocarbons were the only available carbon source was also studied. Furthermore, aiming at extending the range of n-alkanes studied a new mixture B containing n-alkanes up to C30 was used. It was observed that B. subtilis isolates #191, #309, #316, #551, #552 and #572 degraded the higher n-alkanes (>C27) under anaerobic conditions, and the percentage of n-alkanes with chains containing less than 25 carbons increased relatively to the control sample (Figure 2.3). The best results were obtained with isolates #191, #309 and #552.\nFigure 2.3 Variation of relative weight fraction of n-alkanes present in paraffinic mixture B after incubation with bacterial isolates for 15 days, at 40\u00b0C and anaerobic conditions as compared to the control.\nThe ability of a thermophilic Bacillus strain to degrade n-alkanes ranging from C15 to\n22 10\nC36, but not those lower than C14 was observed by Wang et al. . She et al. observed degradation of n-alkanes between C14 and C26 by three Bacillus strains isolated from an oil field. Kato et al. isolated two Bacillus thermoleovorans strains from a petroleum reservoir which degraded n-alkanes between C12 and C30. Das and Mukherjee also observed that B. subtilis DM-04 preferentially degraded crude oil n-alkanes between C14 and C30. However, those assays were performed in aerobic conditions. G. amicalis LH3 utilizes a wide range of long-chain n-alkanes (C18-C36), although under aerobic conditions degraded preferentially n-alkanes between C18 and C24, whereas under anaerobic conditions degraded higher n-alkanes (C34-C36)25. In MEOR processes, the degradation of long-chain n-alkanes under anaerobic conditions is a very important tool, since most of the oil reservoirs are anaerobic. Isolates #191, #309 and #552 showed the ability of degrading n-alkanes with chains higher than C27 into lighter ones under anaerobic conditions, which can be applied to improve the flow properties of crude oil. Furthermore, isolates #191 and #309 additionally showed biosurfactant production\nunder anaerobic conditions, thus suggesting those isolates attractive candidates for application in MEOR.\n2.4.7.\tCritical Micelle Concentration (cmc)\nFreeze-dried biosurfactants obtained from the different isolates were dissolved in PBS (pH 7.0) at a concentration of 1 g.L-1 for B. subtilis isolates, and 5 g.L-1 for P. aeruginosa strains, and surface tensions, as well as their emulsifying activity, were determined. As can be seen from Table 2.4, the lowest surface tension values were obtained with isolates #309 and #311; those isolates also showed the highest emulsifying activities, except for the isolates #111 and #902 (but in this case, biosurfactant concentration was five times higher). To obtain the cmc, the original concentrations were serially diluted with PBS buffer and the surface tension was determined. The effective concentration of biosurfactants from B. subtilis isolates was found to be much lower than that of biosurfactants from P. aeruginosa strains, with cmc values 20-100 times lower. The lowest cmc values (0.02 g.L-1) correspond to isolates #309 and #311, with a minimum surface tension value of 30 mN.m-1.\nTable 2.4 Surface tension values (ST, mN.m-1), emulsification indexes (\u00a324, %) and critical micelle concentrations (cmc, g.L-1), obtained with freeze-dried biosurfactants from the different isolates dissolved in PBS (pH 7.0).

Data obtained are presented in Table 2.5. The maximum surface tension reduction was reached with a NaCl concentration of 50 g.L-1 for all the isolates, and at 100 g.L-1 the surface tension values were still lower than the obtained at 10 g.L- , similar to the results described by other authors , , - .

Some isolates grew under anaerobic conditions in medium with NaCl concentrations up to 100 g.L-1 and temperature up to 45-50\u00b0C and were not inhibited by the presence of hydrocarbons. The biosurfactants produced by those isolates have some interesting properties, including thermo- and salttolerance; ability to reduce the surface tension of water to 30 mN.m-1; ability to emulsify hydrocarbons and critical micelle concentrations of 0.02-0.03 g.L-1. Some B. subtilis isolates were also capable of degrading the heavier n-alkanes in different paraffinic mixtures, both under aerobic or anaerobic conditions at 40\u00b0C. Some isolates (#191 and #309) also exhibited simultaneously the ability for biosurfactant production and hydrocarbon degradation, making them promising candidates for MEOR. Their usefulness for MEOR applications will be further evaluated using laboratory scale sandpack columns.\n2.6.\tReferences\n1.\tBrown, L.R., Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR).

Mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids were identified for both isolates, but the most abundant were found to be mono-rhamnolipids. The similarity of rhamnolipids produced by the two strains was in good agreement with their surface-activities. Both biosurfactants exhibited similar aqueous solution surface tensions, high emulsification indexes, and critical micelle concentration values. The results obtained show that ESIMS and MS/MS analysis alone provide a fast and highly specific characterization of biosurfactants produced by microbial strains.\nKeywords: rhamnolipids, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, biosurfactants, mass spectrometry, ESI-MS.\n3.2.\tIntroduction\nSurface-active agents or surfactants are amphiphilic molecules that comprise both hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties, which are able to reduce surface and interfacial tensions, and can form and stabilize oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions1. These compounds have several applications and traditionally are used in food, pharmaceutical, cosmetics and petroleum industries . Chemical surfactants are widely used in industry but the increase of environmental issues and restrictive laws led to the development of biodegradable and naturally produced surfactants, such as oleo chemical- or sugar-based and microbial surfactants3. Biosurfactants appear as a reliable alternative due to their lower toxicity, higher biodegradability and effectiveness at extreme temperature, salinity and pH conditions4, 5.\nSeveral biosurfactants have been reported, but the most important groups include glycolipids and lipopeptides . Glycolipids consist of a carbohydrate moiety linked to long-chain aliphatic acids or hydroxyl aliphatic acids6. Among them, the most relevant are the rhamnolipids produced by Pseudomonas species due to their good surfaceactivity and emulsifying properties , . Rhamnolipids are composed of one or two f-hydroxy fatty acids of different chain length (C8-C22) linked to a mono-rhamnose\n(Rha-) or di-rhamnose (Rha-Rha) unit6, 9 The two major rhamnolipids groups are the mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids; however, there are more than 58 rhamnolipid congeners and homologs with different combinations of saturated and unsaturated acyl chains and sugar moieties2, 7 8 10, 11.\nMass spectrometry (MS) coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) is a powerful analytical technique that has been commonly used for the identification and analysis of several biomolecules, such as lipids and carbohydrates . Using this approach, it is possible to obtain information about the structural details of the analyzed molecules. Moreover, taking into account that rhamnolipids contain both lipids and carbohydrates in their structure, these molecules are ideal to be analyzed by MS with ESI. This technique has the advantage of allowing the analysis of very small amounts of sample, even when present in mixtures and without derivatization. However, information on the analysis of rhamnolipids by MS is scarce; thus, this study constitutes an important approach to fill this necessity. Until now, the characterization of the structure of rhamnolipids using MS focused mainly in the use of ESI-MS analysis in the negative mode10, 14-18 and only one study reported the use of MS in positive mode, using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)19. Among these studies, only the work carried out in the negative mode suggested the use of tandem MS (MS/MS) for the identification of the structure details of these biomolecules14. Even if these works performed the study of the fragmentation by increasing the cone voltage ion of the ESI source, after MS had been coupled with liquid chromatography (LC), this is not a truly MS/MS analysis. In addition, analysis of the fragmentation pathways of rhamnolipids positive ions was not previously performed or reported. In positive mode the rhamnolipid ionized preferentially as [M+Na]+ ions, as identified by Price and collaborators19. However, these authors did not confirm the structural features of the rhamnolipids identified by MS/MS. In fact, MS spectra with the identification of the [M+Na]+ ions allowed the identification of the molecular weight of compounds, while the identification and confirmation of the structural features can only be achieved using MS/MS strategies.\nIn this work the chemical characterization of rhamnolipids produced by two different strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated from Brazilian crude oils (chapter 2), was conducted using 1H NMR and MS approach based on ESI-MS and MS/MS techniques in positive mode. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the fragmentation pathways 44\nobserved in the MS/MS spectra of the [M+Na]+ ions was performed to confirm the structural features of the glycolipids. The surface-active and emulsification properties of rhamnolipid solutions were evaluated, as well as the relation between these features and the chemical structure of the rhamnolipids.\n3.3.\tExperimental\n3.3.1.\tIsolation of Microorganisms from Crude Oil Samples and Biosurfactant Production and Recovery\nCrude oil samples from four wells of a Brazilian oil field were collected in sterile bottles. For the isolation of microorganisms, enrichment cultures were performed as described previously20. Biosurfactant production by the selected strains was carried out in shake flasks containing 500 mL of LB medium. Each flask was inoculated with 5 mL of a pre-culture that was prepared using the same culture medium and incubated overnight at 40\u00b0C and 120 rpm. The flasks were then incubated at the same conditions until the stationary phase was reached. At the end of the fermentation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10000*g, 20 min, 10\u00b0C) and cell dry weight (g.L-1) was determined. To recover the biosurfactant, the cell free supernatant was subjected to acid precipitation. After the precipitation, the crude biosurfactant was dissolved in a minimal amount of demineralized water and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 using NaOH 1 M. Finally, the crude biosurfactant solution was freeze-dried and the product obtained was weighed and stored at -20\u00b0C for further use.\n3.3.2.\tIdentification of the Isolates\nBacterial isolates that displayed high biosurfactant production were selected and identified by partial 16S rRNA sequencing. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using primers 341F and 907R. The resulting sequences were compared with sequences in the GenBank database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using the nucleotide-nucleotide blast (BLASTn) network service, to determine their phylogenetic affiliations.\n3.3.3.\tExtraction and Purification of Rhamnolipids\nRhamnolipids were extracted from cell-free supernatants, using the Folch extraction commonly used to extract lipids from biomolecules. The Folch extraction procedure\n22\nwas performed as described elsewhere , briefly by adding 2:1 chloroform/methanol mixture to the supernatant sample to achieve a final ratio of chloroform/methanol/water (8:4:3). The mixture was centrifuged (9000*g, 5 min), the organic layer was collected and the samples were evaporated to dryness under N2 at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Prior to MS and NMR analysis, the samples were re-dissolved in chloroform.\n3.3.4.\tMass Spectrometry\nAnalysis of rhamnolipids was carried out by MS using ESI ionization obtained in a Q-ToF 2 (Micromass, Manchester, UK). ESI conditions in electrospray Q-Tof mass spectrometer were as follows: electrospray voltage was 3 kV in the positive mode with a cone voltage of 30 V. The source temperature was 80\u00b0C and the desolvation temperature was 150\u00b0C. MS/MS spectra were performed using argon as collision gas and energy between 30-40 V. Data was acquired using a Mass Lynx data system (V4.0).\n3.3.5.\tNMR Spectroscopy\nThe purified rhamnolipids were re-dissolved in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3), and the respective 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a BrukerAvance 300 spectrometer operating at 300.13 MHz.\n3.4.\tResults and Discussion\n3.4.1.\tIsolation and Identification of Biosurfactant-producing Microorganisms\nIsolates #111 and #902 were identified according to the partial sequence obtained from their 16S rRNA genes. The sequences obtained were compared with those described in databases and both of them showed 100% similarity with P. aeruginosa. The sequences were deposited in the GenBank database under accession numbers JQ281109 and JQ281110. The sequences obtained for both isolates showed 99% similarity. This fact, together with the different morphology exhibited by both isolates growing in solid and liquid media, confirms that they are different isolates.\n3.4.2.\tNMR Spectroscopy Analysis\nThe composition of the biosurfactants obtained from isolates #111 and #902 was probed by 1H NMR analysis. The respective 1H chemical shifts are shown in Table 3.1, and respective spectra presented in Supporting Information (Figure S3.1 and S3.2).\nTable 3.1 1H NMR spectroscopy data from rhamnolipids (5 values, ppm) produced by two different strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (#111 and #902).\n\t\t#902\t#111\nMoiety\tProton location\ta (ppm)\ta (ppm)\nRhamnose(s)\tC-1\u2019\t4.82\t4.86\n\tC-2\u2019\t3.63 - 3.78\t3.62 - 3.80\n\tC-3\u2019\t3.63 - 3.78\t3.62 - 3.80\n\tC-4\u2019\t3.48\t3.47\n\tC-5\u2019\t3.63 - 3.78\t3.62 - 3.80\n\tC-6\u2019\t1.24\t1.24\nHydroxy fatty acid\tC-1\t4.20 - 4.22\t4.18 - 4.25\n\tC-2\t2.29 - 2.61\t2.15 - 2.72\n\tC-3\t-\t1.65-1.69\n\tCOOH\t-\t-\n\tch3\t0.86\t0.84\n\tC-4\t5.28 - 5.38\t5.28-5.46\n\tC-5\t2.29 - 2.61\t2.15 - 2.72\n\tch2\t1.24 - 1.58\t1.24-1.50\nThe 1H NMR spectra were in good agreement with those obtained by other authors6, 10,19 showing that the purified surfactants samples presented the chemical shifts deviations characteristic of rhamnolipids homologs. The spectrum of isolate #902 showed signals related to a sugar moiety at a 4.82 (C-1\u2019), 3.63-3.78 (C-2\u2019, C-3\u2019, C-5\u2019), 3.48 (C-4\u2019) and 1.24 (C-6\u2019) related to a rhamnose moiety. A similar spectrum was also obtained for isolate #111 at, respectively, a 4.86 (C-1\u2019), 3.62-3.80 (C-2\u2019, C-3\u2019, C-5\u2019), 3.47 (C-4\u2019) and 1.24 (C-6\u2019). In addition, both spectra showed the hydroxy fatty acid signals. As 1H NMR was used, it was not possible to define the rhamnolipids structure precisely, thus these were further characterized by ESI/MS and MS-MS as described below.\n3.4.3.\tMass Spectrometry\nThe ESI-MS spectra, obtained in positive mode, of the extracts obtained for each isolate (#111 and #902) are shown in Figure 3.1. In both ESI-MS spectra, it is possible to identify several sodium adducts, [M+Na]+ ions, from the rhamnolipids present in the samples. The correspondent potassium adducts, [M+K]+ ions, are also observed, thus allowing the confirmation that rhamnolipid species are present. The formation of these adducts is typical of carbohydrate derivatives13 by ESI-MS and was also observed by other researchers during MALDI-MS analysis of rhamnolipids19.\nFigure 3.1 ESI-MS spectra obtained using an electrospray Q TOF mass spectrometer in positive mode of #111 and #902 biosurfactants. Y-axis: Relative abundance considering the highest abundant ion as 100%; X-axis: m/z for each ion. ESI- MS spectra were acquired in the positive mode.\nThe ions identified in the ESI-MS spectra (Figure 3.1) were attributed to both mono-and di-rhamnolipids with distinct fatty acyl chains as shown in Table 3.2.\nThe most abundant ions observed in the extracts are mono-rhamnolipids, namely Rha-C10:0/C10:0, corresponding to [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 527.2, followed by Rha-C10:0/C12:0 and Rha-C10:0/C12:1, corresponding to [M+Na]+ ions at m/z 555.3 and\n553.3,\trespectively. The di-rhamnolipids found are Rha-Rha-C10:0/C10:0 and Rha-Rha-C10:0/C12:0, corresponding to [M+Na]+ ions at m/z 673.3 and 701.3, respectively (Table 3.2).\nTable 3.2 Identification of [M+Na]+ and [M+K]+ ions observed in the ESI-MS spectra corresponding to mono and di-rhamnolipids present in the total sample (extract).\n\tm/z [M+K]+\tm/z [M+Na]+\tFatty acyl chains*\n\t543.2\t527.2\tC10:0/C10:0\nMono-rhamnolipids\t569.2\t553.3\tC10:0/C12:1\n\t571.2\t555.3\tC10:0/C12:0\n\t689.3\t673.3\tC10:0/C10:0\nDi-rhamnolipids\t\t\t\n\t717.2\t701.3\tC10:0/C12:0\n*The attribution of the fatty acyl chains composition of each molecular species was done accordingly with the interpretation of the correspondent MS/MS spectra; fatty acyls (Cx:y): the first value indicates x number of carbons in the fatty acid chain and the second value y represents the number of double bonds in that chain.\nFew differences were found between the two samples analyzed. Although ESI-MS is a qualitative and not a quantitative method, it was possible to notice some differences in the relative abundance of di-rhamnolipids ions comparing samples from #902 and #111 isolates. Biosurfactant from isolate #111 seems to have a minor relative abundance of the Rha-Rha-C10:0/C10:0 and Rha-Rha-C10:0/C12:0 comparing to #902. Although obtained from two P. aeruginosa strains, apparently these two samples have a similar composition of rhamnolipids, which could be explained by their similar surface activities and emulsifying properties previously described20. The large cmc values obtained for these biosurfactants20 when compared with other rhamnolipids previously reported may be due to two factors: on one hand Mata-Sandoval et al.26 showed that rhamnolipids with short chain fatty acids have smaller hydrophobicity and, accordingly, start to form micelles at higher biosurfactant concentrations; on the other hand, the presence of di-rhamnolipids in the mixtures of surfactants obtained from both isolates (#111 and #902) also leads to an increase in the cmc values. This behavior has also been observed by Haba et al. that showed that higher cmc values are obtained due the contribution of the di-rhamnolipid.\nposition in the rhamnolipid structure and the confirmation of presence of the rhamnose sugar units. Below, a detailed explanation on the typical fragmentation of a monorhamnolipid and a di-rhamnolipid is given. Rha-C10:0/C12:0 corresponding to [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 555.3 and Rha-Rha-C10:0/C10:0 corresponding to [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 673.3 are used as examples.\nAn MS/MS spectrum of the [M+Na]+ ion of the Rha-C10:0/C12:0 (Figure 3.2a)) shows a product ion at m/z 409, formed due to the loss of the rhamnose residue (-146 Da) and ions attributed to the rhamnose residue [Rhamnoseres+Na]+ at m/z 169 and to rhamnose unit [Rhamnose+Na]+ at m/z 187 as illustrated in Figure 3.2. Other product ions are observed at m/z 357 due to the loss of the terminal fatty acyl chain (-170 Da), and also the ions corresponding to the [hydroxy fatty acid+Na]+ at m/z 239, identified as the terminal fatty acid (C12C24O3), and at m/z 211 identified as the middle fatty acid (C10H20O3). These fragmentation pathways allow identifying the molecular weight and structure of the fatty acids that constitute the mono-rhamnolipid and their position in the initial molecule.\nMoreover, the ESI-MS/MS spectrum of the [M+Na]+ ion of the di-rhamnolipid, Rha-Rha-C10:0/C10:0 (Figure 3.3a)), showed product ions formed by the loss of one (-146 Da) and two rhamnose residues (2x -146 Da) with the subsequent formation of the ions at m/z 527 and m/z 381, respectively. The product ion at m/z 315, identified as [Rhamnose2+Na]+ confirms that both rhamnose units are linked together. Ions attributed to one rhamnose were identified at m/z 169 [Rhamnoseres+Na]+ and m/z 187 [Rhamnose+Na]+. In this spectrum, it is possible to see other informative ions formed by the loss of the terminal of fatty acyl chain (-170 Da- -C10H20O3) at m/z 503, the loss of a fatty acyl and a rhamnose (-316 Da) at m/z 357 and also the ions corresponding to the fatty acyls chains at m/z 211.\nFigure 3.2 a) ESI-MS/MS spectrum of the [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 555.3 corresponding to monorhamnolipid Rha-C10:0/C12:0 obtained in ESI-QTOF. b) Molecular structure of Rha-C10:0/C12:0 with the main cleavages correspondent to the fragmentation observed in the MS/MS spectrum of [M+Na]+ ion. c) Molecular structure of the ions originated from the fragmentation of [M+Na]+ ion.\nFigure 3.3 a) ESI-MS/MS spectrum of the [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 673.3 corresponding to di-rhamnolipid Rha-Rha-10:0/10:0 obtained in ESI-Q TOF. b) Molecular structure of Rha-Rha-10:0/10:0 with the main cleavages correspondent to the fragmentation observed in the MS/MS spectrum of [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 673.3. c) Molecular structure of the ions originated from the fragmentation of [M+Na]+ ion at m/z 673.3.\nThis approach was used to elucidate the structure of all the rhamnolipids identified and the results are reported in Table 3.2. There are a few studies that characterize the fragmentation of rhamnolipids with MS/MS, the best known being the rupture of ester link between two alkyl chains of rhamnolipids and near sugar units in negative mode ([M-H]-) , . In spite of this work having been carried in positive mode, with formation of [M+Na]+, the fragmentations observed are similar, suggesting that they are characteristic of these molecules.\nThis is one of the first studies on the characterization of rhamnolipids by MS in positive mode, with formation of [M+Na]+ ions19, 29, and the first using electrospray ionization. The results here reported are in good agreement with Price et al19 which identified the rhamnolipids structure with MS in positive mode and MALDI ionization, observing the mono-rhamnolipids Rha-C10:0/C10:0, Rha-C10:0/C12:0 and Rha-C10:0/C12:1 and the di-rhamnolipids Rha-Rha-C10:0/C10:0 and Rha-Rha-C10:0/C12:0 with formation of [M+Na]+ ions and a minor part with formation of [M+K]+ ions. The results obtained herein show that ESI-MS and MS/MS analysis are powerful techniques for characterizing biosurfactants produced by microbial strains, allowing the identification and confirmation of the structural features using only MS/MS strategies, without the LC previous analysis.\n3.5.\tConclusion\nIn this work biosurfactants produced by two isolated P. aeruginosa strains were characterized. Their structures have been identified by 1H NMR as being rhamnolipids and further characterized by ESI/MS and MS/MS as mixtures of mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids. The most abundant homologs found in the extracts were the monorhamnolipids, Rha-C10:0/C12:0 and Rha-C10:0/C12:1 and the di-rhamnolipids Rha-Rha-C10:0/C10:0 and Rha-Rha-C10:0/C12:0. The rhamnolipid structural characterization showed that although these surfactants have been obtained from two different P. aeruginosa strains, they have a close composition that explains their similar behavior. The structural characterization of the biosurfactants produced by microorganisms is very important to understand their surface-active properties and formation of molecular aggregates. The development of rapid analysis, such as ESI-MS and MS/MS, which allow the characterization with high sensitivity and specificity of the surfactants present in bacterial extracts, is crucial. In conclusion, it is important to\nunderstand biosurfactants specificities in order to increase their potential applications as, for example, in bioremediation of environments contaminated with crude oil and in tertiary recovery of crude oil from reservoirs by MEOR processes. In this context, the results herein reported show that ESI-MS and MS/MS analysis can be powerful techniques for a simple and fast structural characterization of biosurfactants produced by microbial strains.\n3.6.\tReferences\n1.\tDesai, J.

The lowest surface tension values were obtained using sucrose containing media for the three isolates. Biosurfactants produced by each strain were characterized by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and were further characterized by proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H NMR), and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). The chemical characterization showed that the three isolates produced very similar mixtures, containing C13-, C14- and C15-surfactin, although in different proportions. The structure of surfactins produced by the three strains was shown to be in good agreement with their surface-activities. The interfacial-activities of the biosurfactants were characterized and compared with chemical surfactants. Furthermore, the application of biosurfactants and chemical surfactants in oil recovery was evaluated. The results obtained showed that these biosurfactants have better interfacial-activity and oil recovery efficiency than common chemical surfactants, thus being more attractive to be applied in Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery.\nKeywords: Surfactins; Bacillus subtilis; Biosurfactants; MEOR; MALDI-TOF.\n4.2.\tIntroduction\nAs described in chapter 3, the interest for biosurfactants is increasing mainly due to environmental issues and restrictive laws1, and also by the fast progress of biotechnology and their interesting features, including their lower toxicity, higher biodegradability and effectiveness at extreme temperature, salinity and pH conditions2,3. Furthermore, biosurfactants exhibit high surface-activities together with low critical micelle concentrations (cmc), being in some cases even lower than most of the traditional chemical surfactants2.\nDespite all these advantages, only few biosurfactants are produced at large scale for commercial applications, essentially due to their considerable low production and recovery costs4. In the last years, aiming a large industrial application of biosurfactants, the use of novel resources, raw materials and new microorganisms has been explored to reduce the production costs and to increase their effectiveness5-11. Many biosurfactants\nhave been described, being glycolipids12, 13 and lipopeptides14, 15 the most common. Lipopeptides are produced, among others, by several Bacillus species. They are constituted by a peptide (hydrophilic moiety) linked to a fatty acid (hydrophobic component)14. Surfactin, produced by Bacillus subtilis strains, is the best studied lipopeptide biosurfactant. It consists of a long-chain P-hydroxy fatty acid whose two functional groups close a short peptidic moiety composed of seven amino acid residues16, 17 The surfactins are classified in three different types (A, B and C) according to their amino acid sequences . B. subtilis strains do not produce a unique type of surfactin, occurring a natural diversity of homologues, which differ in the length and ramification of the fatty acid chains, and isoforms, characterized by some differences in the peptidic sequence16. Different isoforms and homologues exhibit different properties and activities. As the surfactin name indicates, this biosurfactant exhibits an exceptional surface activity, and is among the most effective biosurfactants known so far, being able to decrease the surface tension of water from 72 to 27 mN.m-1 at concentrations as low as 0.005%19.\nSurfactins are considered powerful biosurfactants , and can be used by the petroleum industry in MEOR processes and bioremediation3, as well as by the biomedical industry as therapeutic agents , . Amongst the several potential applications of surfactin, its use in MEOR represents one of the most promising methods to recover substantial amounts of the residual oil entrapped in mature oil fields , . The replacement of conventional synthetic surfactants by these bio-compounds appears to be a good and efficient approach; however, it still depends on the strategy adopted. The use of biosurfactants in MEOR can be performed in two different ways. In the first one, biosurfactants are produced ex situ, and subsequently injected into the reservoir. The other option is to produce the biosurfactant in situ by stimulation and/or injection of indigenous microorganisms. The first approach is limited by the costs involved in the biosurfactant production and purification processes. On the other hand, the costs involved in the second approach are apparently lower; however it requires that the microorganisms used are properly stimulated and able to produce sufficient amounts of the biosurfactant .\nTaking into account the use of surfactins in situ MEOR processes, the greatest challenge is to isolate microorganisms able to grow under anaerobic conditions, high salinities, temperatures and pressures. Several reports have described the isolation of B. subtilis strains from oil reservoirs22-25, which suggest that these organisms can be successfully\nused under reservoir conditions. Recently, Gudina et al.26 isolated several B. subtilis strains from a Brazilian oil reservoir that were able to produce different biosurfactants under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Among them, three different strains produced biosurfactants with interesting surface-activities and emulsifying properties.\nAiming at the further use of these B. subtilis strains in MEOR processes, the biosurfactant production yields must be improved which can be achieved through the optimization of culture media, specifically of the carbon and nitrogen sources. In this work, biosurfactant production by the three B. subtilis strains previously isolated from Brazilian oil reservoirs26 was optimized through a proper manipulation of the carbon and nitrogen sources. The biosurfactants produced by each strain were characterized by 1H NMR, FTIR and MALDI-TOF, and their abilities to influence the interfacial tension of water/oil systems and enhance oil recovery were evaluated and compared with chemical surfactants.\n4.3.\tMaterials and Methods\n4.3.1.\tMicroorganisms\nThree biosurfactant-producing B.subtilis strains (#309, #311 and #573) previously isolated from crude oil samples obtained from a Brazilian oil field26 were used. Isolates were stored at -80\u00b0C in LB medium supplemented with a 20% (v/v) glycerol aqueous solution. The composition of LB medium was (g.L-1): NaCl 10.0; tryptone 10.0; yeast extract 5.0. The pH was adjusted to 7.0.\n4.3.2.\tChemical Surfactants\nTwo chemical surfactants (Enordet and Petrostep) commonly used in chemical enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) were studied and their interfacial activities were compared with the biosurfactants produced by B. subtilis strains.\n4.3.3.\tEffect of Carbon and Nitrogen Sources on Growth and Biosurfactant Production\nGrowth and biosurfactant production by the three isolates was evaluated using Mineral Salt Solution (MSS) with different carbon and nitrogen sources. The MSS consisted of (g.L-1): NaCl 10.0; Na2HPO4 5.0; KH2PO4 2.0; MgSO4.7H2O 0.2. The carbon sources evaluated were: sodium acetate (AC), sodium citrate (CI), fructose (FRU), glucose\n(GLU), glycerol (GLY), n-hexadecane (HEX), lactose (LAC), meat extract (ME), paraffin (PAR), sucrose (SUC), tryptone (TRY) and yeast extract (YE), using ammonium nitrate as the nitrogen source (2 g.L-1). The different carbon sources were added to the MSS at a concentration of 10 g.L-1. The nitrogen sources tested were: ammonium citrate (AC), ammonium nitrate (AN), ammonium sulfate (AS), meat extract (ME), sodium nitrate (SN), tryptone (TRY), urea (U) and yeast extract (YE), keeping sucrose as the carbon source (10 g.L-1). The different nitrogen sources were added to the MSS at a concentration of 2 g.L-1. All media were adjusted to pH 7.0.\nAssays were performed in 100 mL flasks containing 50 mL of the different media. Each flask was inoculated with 1% of a pre-culture grown in the same medium for 24 h. Cultures were incubated at 40\u00b0C without shaking for 120 h. Samples were taken at different times during the fermentation to determine biomass concentration and biosurfactant production. Bacterial growth was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged (10000 x g, 20 min, 20\u00b0C) and the cell-free supernatants were used to measure surface tension and emulsifying activity. At the end of the fermentation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and dry cell weight (g.L-1) was determined (48 h at 105\u00b0C).\nTo recover the biosurfactants, cell free supernatants were subjected to an acid precipitation. Briefly, the supernatants were adjusted to pH 2.0 with HCl 6 M and left overnight at 4\u00b0C. Afterwards, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (10000 x g, 20 min, 4\u00b0C) and washed twice with acidified water (pH 2.0). The precipitated biosurfactants were dissolved in a minimal amount of demineralized water and the pH was adjusted to 7.0 using NaOH 1 M. Finally, the biosurfactant solutions were freeze dried and the products obtained were weighed.\n4.3.4.\tSurface-activity Determination\nSurface tension measurements of culture broth supernatants and chemical surfactant solutions were performed according to the Du Nouy ring method described elsewhere27. A KRUSS K6 Tensiometer (KRUSS GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a 1.9 cm Du Nouy platinum ring was used. Whenever required, the culture broth supernatants were diluted 10 times (ST-1) or 100 times (ST-2) with PBS (10 mM KH2PO4/K2HPO4 plus150 mM NaCl with pH adjusted to 7.0) and the surface tension was measured as\ndescribed above. The cmc of each chemical surfactant dissolved in demineralized water were calculated as described elsewhere27. To increase the accuracy of the surface tension measurements, an average of triplicates was determined. All measurements were performed at room temperature (20\u00b0C).\n4.3.5.\tEmulsifying Activity Determination\nThe emulsifying activity was determined by the addition of 2 mL of n-hexadecane to the same volume of cell-free culture broth supernatant in glass test tubes. The tubes were mixed with vortex at high speed for 2 min and subsequently incubated at 25\u00b0C for 24 h. The stability of the emulsion was determined after 24 h, and the emulsification index (E24) was calculated as the percentage of the height of the emulsified layer (mm) divided by the total height of the liquid column (mm). All emulsification indexes were performed in triplicate.\n4.3.6.\tInterfacial-activity Determination\nConcentrations ranging from 0.001 to 0.1 g.L-1 of crude biosurfactants recovered from the different isolates were prepared in brine solution (50 g.L-1 NaCl with pH adjusted to 6.0). These conditions were previously established as optimal for the activity of biosurfactants under study26. The chemical surfactants were dissolved in demineralized water at different concentrations up to 1 g.L-1. Arabian light crude oil used in these experiments was kindly provided by GALP (Portugal). Interfacial tension of the water/oil system at different biosurfactant/chemical surfactant concentrations was measured using a Dataphysics contact angle system OCA-20. The method consisted in the analysis of the shape of a pendant drop by fitting to the Young-Laplace equation. A Hamilton DS 500/GT syringe connected to a stainless steel needle placed inside a glass chamber with the biosurfactant aqueous solution at room temperature was used to set a fixed drop oil volume (5.00 \u00b1 0.15 qL). For each biosurfactant concentration, at least three independent measures were conducted. For each drop, data were recorded immediately after the drop volume was reached (5 qL) and continued during 1 min (an average of 80 images was captured per drop). The drop shape was analyzed with the software modules SCA 20, using the gravitational acceleration (g = 9.8018 m.s-) and latitude (lat = 40\u00b0) values in accordance with the assay location. The density values\nrequired for the calculation of the interfacial tensions from the drop image data were acquired using a Viscometer-Densimeter Anton Paar (Model SVM 3000).\n4.3.7.\tExtraction and Purification of Biosurfactants\nBiosurfactants for chemical composition analysis were extracted from cell-free supernatants using the Folch extraction method that is commonly used to extract lipids from biomolecules. The Folch extraction procedure was performed as described elsewhere28. Briefly, a chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1, v/v) was added to the supernatant sample to a final chloroform/methanol/water ratio of 8:4:3. The mixture was centrifuged (9000 x g, 5 min), the organic layer was collected and the samples were evaporated to dryness under N2 at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Prior to NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry analysis, the samples were re-dissolved in chloroform.\n4.3.8.\tFourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy\nThe solid biosurfactant extracts recovered from the supernatants of the three B. subtilis isolates were characterized by FTIR.The FTIR spectra, with a resolution of 4 cm-1, were collected from 400 to 4000 wavenumbers (cm-1), and is an average of 128 scans using a Tensor 27 Infrared Spectrometer operating in the attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode (equipped with a single horizontal Golden Gate ATR cell).\n4.3.9.\tNuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy\nThe extracted biosurfactants were re-dissolved in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) and the respective 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 25\u00b0C using a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer operating at 300.13 MHz. Chemical shifts (6) are given on the ppm scale relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) used as reference.\n4.3.10.\tMass Spectrometry analysis\nThe extracted biosurfactants were dissolved at a concentration of 2 g.L-1 in a solution composed of 50% acetonitrile (ACN), 50% water and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The samples were mixed (1:1, v/v) with a matrix consisting of a saturated solution of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid prepared in 50% acetonitrile / 0.1% TFA. An aliquot of 1 |iL of each sample/matrix mixture was spotted onto the MALDI sample and slowly dried to allow matrix crystallization. Then, the extracted biosurfactants were analyzed\nby mass spectrometry (MS) using a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (4800 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems, Europe) in the positive ion reflector mode. Spectra were obtained in the mass range between 800 and 4500 Da with ca. 1500 laser shots, thus providing a mass resolution of about 18000 (FWMH) and a mass accuracy of 20-25 ppm. MS data were processed using Data Explorer 4.4 (Applied Biosystems).\n4.3.11.\tApplication of Chemical Surfactants and Biosurfactants in the Removal of Crude Oil from Sand\nThe applicability of biosurfactants produced by B. subtilis #309, #311 and #573 and the chemical surfactants Enordet and Petrostep in oil recovery was evaluated using artificially contaminated sand containing 10% (w/w) of Arabian Light oil. Samples of 40 g of sand were mixed with 4 g of crude oil in 100 mL Erlenmeyer flasks by shaking and allowed to age for 24 h. Afterwards, 40 mL of biosurfactants and commercial surfactants solutions at a concentration of 1 g.L-1 were added to each flask. The flasks were incubated at 100 rpm and 40\u00b0C for 24 h. Then, the oil removed was recovered from the surface and its volume was measured. Control assays were performed using demineralized water at the same conditions. All the experiments were carried out in triplicate.\n4.4.\tResults and Discussion\n4.4.1.\tEffect of Carbon and Nitrogen Sources on Growth and Biosurfactant Production\nTo determine the optimal conditions that yield the highest biosurfactant production by B. subtilis #309, #311 and #573, the effect of various carbon and nitrogen sources was evaluated. The three isolates were able to grow in all the carbon sources tested, except for n-hexadecane. When paraffin was used as the sole carbon source, a slight growth was observed in all the isolates, however lower than the obtained with the water soluble carbon sources tested (Table 4.1). Several authors reported, with different Bacillus strains, that the use of hydrocarbons (including n-hexadecane and paraffin) as the only carbon source, inhibited bacterial growth and biosurfactant production29-31, or resulted\n32\nin poor growth and biosurfactant production32.\nTable 4.1 Surface tension values (ST, mN.m-1), emulsifying indexes (E24, %), biomass concentrations (g dry weight per L) and surfactin concentrations (mg.L-1) obtained for the three Bacillus subtilis isolates grown in MSS with different carbon sources (10 g.L-1) at 40\u00b0C for 120 h.

Glucose and sucrose were reported as the best carbon sources for growth using different Bacillus isolates , , although Joshi et al. obtained better results with fructose.\nThe lowest surface tension values (ST-2) were obtained when sucrose was used as the sole carbon source for all the isolates. The surface tension values were between 27.9 and\n28.4\tmN.m-1, and the ST-2 values between 46.5 and 42.3 mN.m-1 (Table 4.1). Fructose also offered good results regarding surface tension reduction (ST-2) for isolate #309. The use of lactose as carbon source resulted in high surface tension values when compared with the other carbohydrates tested.\nThe results obtained are in agreement with those reported by other authors with different B.subtilis isolates29-33. Several authors obtained the lowest surface tension values using glucose or sucrose29-33 as the sole carbon sources. Abdel-Mawgoud et al.29 also found a poor biosurfactant production using lactose as the sole carbon source. On the other hand, the use of hydrocarbons as the sole carbon source usually resulted in no biosurfactant production29, 30, 32. In the case of B. subtilis #309, #311 and #573, the combination of a water soluble carbon source (sucrose) and a hydrocarbon (n-hexadecane) did not have a negative effect on the biosurfactant production26.\nRegarding the emulsifying activity, the complex carbon sources tested (meat extract, tryptone and yeast extract) were amongst the most favorable. For isolate #309, the highest emulsifying activity was obtained with yeast extract (52.7%), and similar results were obtained with tryptone and meat extract (49.6 and 47.8%, respectively). For isolate #311, the best result was obtained with meat extract (40.3%), followed by tryptone (39.1%) and sucrose (37.3%). For isolate #573, the highest emulsifying activity was obtained with glycerol (48.4%), followed by tryptone (43.6%) and yeast extract (40.3%). Dastgheib et al. found the highest emulsifying activity using yeast extract as the carbon source, followed by sucrose, fructose and glucose, whereas the use of lactose resulted in poor emulsifying activity. For the three isolates, the highest amount of biosurfactant produced (expressed as mg.L-1) was obtained when using sucrose as the carbon source. The amounts of crude biosurfactant produced were 844, 755 and 2158 mg.L-1 for isolates #309, #311 and #573, respectively. The highest amount of\n-2 biosurfactant produced is in agreement with the lowest surface tension values (ST-2) obtained for all the isolates, but curiously not with the highest emulsifying activities, thus suggesting that different types of biosurfactants with different properties are being synthesized depending on the carbon sources used.\nRegarding the nitrogen sources, the highest biomass production was obtained using meat extract as the sole nitrogen source for isolates #309 and #311. For isolate #573, yeast extract and meat extract gave a similar result (Table 4.2).\nThe lowest surface tension values (ST-), which corresponded to the highest biosurfactant productions, were obtained with yeast extract for isolate #309 (38.3mN.m-1); ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate for isolate #573 (44.6 and 46.3mN.m-1, respectively); and for the isolate #311, yeast extract and ammonium sulfate gave similar results (39.2 and 37.0 mN.m-1, respectively). The highest biosurfactant productions were 931, 980 and 2288 mg.L-1 for isolates #309, #311 and #573, respectively. Other authors reported crude biosurfactant productions between 720 and 1120 mg.L-1 29, 30. Isolate #573 produced higher amounts of biosurfactant when compared with isolates #309 and #311. The critical micelle concentrations for these crude biosurfactants were determined in a previous work: 20 mg.L-1 for isolates #309 and #311, and 30 mg.L-1 for isolate #57326. Therefore, biosurfactants produced by isolates #309 and #311 are more efficient than the ones produced by isolate #573, which explains why isolate #573 although producing higher amounts of biosurfactant provides similar (or higher, i.e. less active surfactant) surface tension values than the obtained with the other two isolates.\nAbdel-Magwoud et al.29 reported the highest biosurfactant production using sodium nitrate and ammonium nitrate as nitrogen sources. Other authors reported the highest biosurfactant production using urea , . Some Bacillus isolates do not use ammonium sulfate for growth or biosurfactant production, but they can use ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate30.\nThe highest emulsifying indexes were obtained with sodium nitrate for isolate #573 (41.7%); while for isolate #309, similar results were obtained using yeast extract and sodium nitrate (43.3 and 41.0%, respectively); and for isolate #311, the highest emulsifying indexes were obtained with ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate (37.3 and\n31\n37.2% respectively). Dastgheib et al.31 reported that sodium nitrate was the best substrate for emulsifier production, followed by urea, yeast extract and peptone.\nTaking into account the amounts of biosurfactant produced with the different carbon and nitrogen sources, and in order to standardize the medium for all isolates, sucrose and ammonium nitrate were selected for the production of biosurfactants to be further used in the chemical characterization experiments. Moreover, the use of sucrose and ammonium nitrate represents a good compromise between biosurfactant yields and the costs associated with their production. More complex nitrogen sources provide higher emulsification indexes; however, their cost is also higher which makes a potential application in MEOR economically unfeasible. Also, this medium was found to be adequate for the three isolates (i.e. could be considered as standard medium) and nitrate is crucial for microbial growth under the low oxygen concentrations present in reservoirs.\n4.4.2.\tChemical Characterization\n4.4.2.1.\tFTIR-ATR\nFirstly fast and direct characterizations of the biosurfactants produced by each isolate were performed using a FTIR-ATR analysis (Figure 4.1). The spectra obtained for the three isolates showed a great similarity between them. It can be clearly observed characteristic absorbance bands of peptides at 3305 cm-1 (NH-stretching mode); at 1643 cm-1 (1645 cm-1for isolate #311) resulting from the stretching mode of the CO-N bond; and at 1543 cm-1 from the deformation mode of the N-H bond combined with C-N stretching mode. In addition, it is also clear the presence of aliphatic chains (-CH3; -CH2-), represented by the bands between 2957 to 2855 cm-1, and 1465 to 1368 cm-1. The band observed at 1734 cm-1 is characteristic of a carbonyl group. This first FTIR-ATR analysis indicates the presence of aliphatic hydrocarbons combined with a peptide moiety that is characteristic of lipopeptide biosurfactants, as it has been described in the literature previously32, 34.\nFigure 4.1 FTIR-ATR spectra for biosurfactant extracts produced by isolates #309 (a), #311 (b) and #573\n(c).\n4.4.2.2.\t1H NMR Spectroscopy\nThe characterization of the biosurfactants produced by B. subtilis strains using NMR spectroscopy is well described in the literature35-37. Therefore, the composition of the\nbiosurfactants obtained from isolates #309, #311\nand #573 was probed by 1H NMR\nanalysis (Figure 4.2).\nFigure 4.2 1H NMR spectra for biosurfactant extracts produced by B. subtilis isolates #309 (a), #311 (b) and #573 (c).\nThe three spectra showed two main regions corresponding to resonance of a-carbon protons (3.5-5.5 ppm) and side-chain protons (0.25-3.0 ppm)38, 39. The differences observed in the spectra are in chemical shifts from the region correspondent to the amide protons (6.5-10 ppm), in which the NMR spectrum is less defined. All spectra showed some similarity with the standard surfactin (spectra for standard surfactin reported by Wei and Chu40). However, it is clear the presence of distinct regions relatively to the standard molecule, as well as among the three biosurfactant extracts herein studied. The intense singlet at 3.47 ppm observed in the biosurfactants extracted from isolates #311 and #573 is similar with that observed in 1H NMR spectra of\n35 37\nlipopeptide monoesters reported previously in literature35-37, thus suggesting the presence of one OCH3 group in those biosurfactants. The presence of the methyl esters in the structure of surfactins has been related with an increase of its hydrophobicity and, consequently an increment of their surfactant powers, antifungal and hemolytic activities36. On the other hand, for the three extracts, an intense singlet at 5.28 ppm (5.30 ppm for isolate #309) was observed. This resonance probably corresponds to the H-3 (terminal proton) of the fatty acid chain, which has also been previously observed by other authors36, 37.\nThe integral relation of the two different regions of aliphatic chains (approximately 1.55 to 1.25 ppm and 0.80 to 0.90 ppm) can give an important correlation between the presence of n-surfactin and iso- or/and anteiso-surfactins. The results showed a higher presence of iso forms in the biosurfactants recovered from the supernatant of the isolate #311, and lower concentrations of those forms in the biosurfactant recovered from isolate #573. According to Youssef et al.41, the surface activity of lipoheptapeptides with structures analogous to surfactin increases when the ratio of iso- to normal-even-numbered fatty acids is increased. In our case, lower surface tension values (ST-2) and cmc were obtained for isolate #311 when compared with the isolate #573. However, in the case of lichenysin, iturin and mycosubtilin an opposite behavior was observed, and an increase in the percentage of branched-chain fatty acids was found to decrease the activity of the biosurfactant, whereas an increase in the percentage of straight-chains increased their surface activity36. This may be due to the different amino acid composition of those biosurfactants, which can result in different properties.\nThe 1H NMR analysis of the different biosurfactant extracts produced by different isolates demonstrates the presence of different surfactins mixtures, supporting the different surface activities and emulsifying properties previously discussed. Each surfactins mixture obtained with the Bacillus isolates herein studied was further characterized by mass spectrometry.\n4.4.2.3.\tMass Spectrometry\nThe MALDI-TOF spectra of the biosurfactants obtained from each isolate (#309, #311 and #573) are shown in Figure 4.3.\nFigure 4.3 MALDI-TOF spectra for surfactin-like extracts produced by B. subtilis isolates #309 (a), #311 (b) and #573 (c).\nThe three mass spectra represented in Figure 4.3 show that there are one well-resolved group of peaks at m/z values between 1000 and 1060. This group could be attributed to the different variants of surfactins, as previously described by Vater et al.42 using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Each surfactins mixture extracted has peaks which can be attributed to the protonated forms, with sodium adducts. Each isolate spectrum displays three [M+Na]+ peaks at m/z = 1030.6, 1044.6 and 1058.7, that correspond to the heptapeptide moiety (L-Glu-L-Leu-D-Leu-L-Val-L-Asp-D-Leu-L-Leu) characteristic of surfactins, linked to a C13, C14 or C15 hydroxy fatty acid chain, respectively (Figure 4.4).\nC10 12CHCH2CO \u2014l-GIu \u2014 L-Leu \u2014 D-Leu \u2014 L-Val \u2014 L-Asp \u2014 D-Leu \u2014 L-Leu\nI\n0-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFigure 4.4 Structure of surfactin.\n42\nThe spectra here reported are very similar to those obtained by Vater et al.42 and Leenders et al.43. In addition, it is possible to observe the presence of other surfactins in the extract mixtures, although in lower amounts. These results confirm the data previously obtained by 1H NMR spectra, where it was clearly shown the presence of some mono-methyl ester surfactins, as well as the existence of different types of biosurfactants with different properties synthesized by the three isolates studied. Furthermore, comparing the three different spectra (Figure 4.3) it is possible to found similarity between the mixtures obtained by isolate #311 and #573, as earlier also seen by 1H NMR, in which approximate amounts of C13-, C14-, and C15-surfactin are visible. On the other hand, the spectrum of the biosurfactant produced by the isolate #309 exhibited a more intense peak at 1045.7, corresponding to higher amounts of C14-surfactin in the mixture. Youssef et al.41 showed that iso-C14 surfactin exhibits the optimum hydrophilic-lipophilic balance required for optimum surface activity. Also, Bacon et al.44 reported that surfactins with C-14 acyl chains possess a higher surface activity. This could explain the higher efficiency of biosurfactants produced by isolate #309 when compared with the isolate #573.\n4.4.3.3.\tWater-Oil Interfacial Tension\nTo use these biosurfactants in MEOR processes it is important to first understand their interfacial properties in liquid-liquid equilibrium. Although several researchers have\nstudied the surface-activities at the air/water interface26, 29-31, 45, 46 and the oil/water/rock systems wettability (by the contact angle measurement)47, 48, only few reports present information on the properties of lipopeptides at the liquid/liquid interfaces49, 50. Therefore, to overcome this scarcity, the interfacial tension of a water/oil system was studied for each crude biosurfactant at different concentrations (Figure 4.5).\nFigure 4.5 Interfacial tension values (IFT, mN.m-1) versus logarithm of biosurfactant concentration (g.L\n1) for each biosurfactant extract from B. subtilis isolates #309 (a), #311 (b) and #573 (c).\nThe analysis of the interfacial tension values showed that the biosurfactants produced by the isolates #311 and #573 exhibit a similar ability to decrease the IFT of the Arabian light crude oil/water system. These two biosurfactant mixtures only showed surfactant activities above their cmc (approximately 0.02 and 0.03 g.L-1, respectively, as determined in our previous work26), while in the case of the biosurfactant produced by the isolate #309 it occurred a slight decrease of the IFT before the cmc was reached (0.02 g.L-1)26, being this decrease more significant afterwards. This may be due to the higher percentage of C14-surfactin in the mixture of biosurfactants produced by this isolate, as discussed previously, whereas the similar interfacial-activities observed with the biosurfactants produced by #311 and #573 are in accordance with their surfactin composition, earlier characterized by 1H NMR and mass spectrometry. The three biosurfactant mixtures were found to reduce the IFT values up to 7 mN.m-1. However, higher IFT decreases were expected based on reports from the literature49. Yet, the methodology herein used presents some limitations regarding the drop formation, since for biosurfactant concentrations above 0.1 g.L-1 the drop is unstable originating the immediate drop release, thus for higher biosurfactant concentrations it was not possible to determine the IFT values. Regarding the chemical surfactants Enordet and Petrostep, their cmcs were found to be 1 g.L-1. For a concentration of 0.1 g.L-1 (the highest biosurfactant concentration tested) the IFT values were similar to those obtained with demineralized water (about 21 mN.m-1), whereas for a concentration of 1 g.L-1, Enordet and Petrostep reduced the IFT to 3.0 and 10.5 mN.m-1, respectively. The results obtained show that biosurfactants studied in this work are more efficient than chemical surfactants. Al-Bahry et al.51 observed that surfactins produced by a B. subtilis strain grown on molasses reduced the IFT between water and n-hexadeacne from 23 to 5 mN.m-1 at a concentration of 2.2 g.L-1. However, when higher concentrations of biosurfactant were used, the IFT was reduced up to 1 mN.m-1. Deleu et al.49 reported the reduction of the dodecane/water IFT to values around 2 mN.m-1 using surfactin produced by B. subtilis, being this reduction higher than the observed with other biosurfactants, such as iturin A (14.94 mN.m-1) and fengycin (11.63 mN.m-1). Urum and Pekdemir50 studied the ability of several biosurfactants to decrease the IFT of Ekofisk crude oil and reported that biosurfactants have a higher potential than the chemical surfactant SDS (7.0 mN.m-1), as for example lecithin (5.0 mN.m-1), rhamnolipid (4.5 mN.m-1), saponin (6.0 mN.m-1) and tannin (4.5 mN.m-1). In summary, the reduction of IFT observed indicates the ability of the surfactin mixtures produced by the three B.\nsubtilis isolates herein studied to remove oil from reservoir. As the IFT between crude oil and water is reduced, the capillary force between the oil and the reservoir rock is also reduced. Therefore, this reduction leads to an increased mobilization of the oil in the reservoir which is of great interest to enhance oil recovery in mature reservoirs.\n4.4.3.4.\tApplication of Chemical Surfactants and Biosurfactants in the Removal of Crude Oil from Sand\nThe performance of biosurfactants and chemical surfactants in oil recovery was studied using crude oil contaminated sand. As can be seen from the results obtained (Table 4.3), the different biosurfactants at a concentration of 1 g.L-1 recovered between 19 and 22% of oil, whereas the recoveries obtained with the chemical surfactants at the same concentration were between 9 and 12%. From the results obtained it can be concluded that these biosurfactants are more effective in oil recovery when compared with the chemical surfactants Enordet and Petrostep.\nTable 4.3 Percentages of oil recovered by the different biosurfactants and chemical surfactants at a concentration of 1 g.L-1. Results represent the average of three independent experiments \u00b1 standard deviation.\nBiosurfactant / Chemical Surfactant\t% oil recovered\nB. subtilis #309\t22.1 \u00b1 2.4\nB. subtilis #311\t19.0 \u00b1 1.6\nB. subtilis #573\t18.8 \u00b1 1.1\nEnordet\t11.7 \u00b1 1.9\nPetrostep\t8.7 \u00b1 1.3\nControl\t8.7 \u00b1 1.3\n4.5. Conclusion\nIn the current work, the biosurfactant production by three B. subtilis strains was optimized using different carbon and nitrogen sources. The strains were found to produce biosurfactants with better surface-activities and emulsification properties when sucrose was used as carbon source. No major differences in the biosurfactants performance could be observed when using different nitrogen sources. Crude biosurfactant mixtures were found to be mainly constituted of surfactins with a heptapeptide moiety (L-Glu-L-Leu-D-Leu-L-Val-L-Asp-D-Leu-L-Leu), linked to a C13, C14 or C15 hydroxy fatty acid chain. Although several similarities were found among the\nbiosurfactant mixtures produced by the different isolates, it was evident the presence of different variants of surfactins that could be implicated in the distinct emulsification and surface-active properties found. These biosurfactant mixtures were able to decrease the interfacial tension of Arabian light crude oil/water system more efficiently than chemical surfactants, and showed better results in oil recovery, thus suggesting their interest for use in MEOR processes.\n4.6.\tReferences\n1.\tMukherjee, S., Das, P., and Sen, R., Towards commercial production of microbial surfactants.

Stimulation of biosurfactant production by indigenous microorganisms can reduce the capillary forces that retain the oil into the reservoir. The studied reservoir is characterized by alternated oil and water sand layers, with an average porosity of 25% and a permeability of 50 mD. It's a flat structure at 450 m depth, with an initial pressure of 32.4 bars and a temperature of 42.5\u00b0C. The oil is paraffinic, with low viscosity, high pour point and a gravity of 25\u00b0 API, with no gas dissolved. Due to these properties, the wells can't flow naturally and the production has to be lifted, making this reservoir a good candidate for MEOR application. This work addresses the isolation and identification of microorganisms capable of producing biosurfactants and degrading heavy oil fractions at the oil reservoir conditions. Five Bacillus subtilis strains isolated from oil samples were able to grow and produce extracellular biosurfactants at 40\u00b0C under anaerobic conditions in medium supplemented with hydrocarbons. In addition, some of the isolates displayed a capacity to degrade, both in aerobic and anaerobic conditions, the large alkyl chains, and reduce the viscosity of hydrocarbon mixtures. A sand-pack column model was designed to simulate the oil recovery operations and evaluate the mobilization of residual oil by microorganisms. Additional oil recovery using B. subtilis isolates ranged from 19.8 to 35.0%, suggesting that stimulation of biosurfactant production by these strains in situ can contribute to mobilize entrapped oil. The novelty of this technique, compared to the conventional EOR methods, is the application of indigenous microorganisms to increase the oil recovery.\n5.2.\tIntroduction\nAs explained in chapters 1 and 2, the MEOR techniques studied in this work, were focused on the biosurfactants production by microorganisms isolated from Brazilian oil reservoirs and their biodegradation ability. However, the efficiency of biodegradation of oil compounds is limited by a poor mass transfer due to their high hydrophobicity and low aqueous solubility. Surfactants and biosurfactants increase the aqueous solubility of hydrocarbons and enhance their bioavailability and degradation rates1.\nLaboratory studies on MEOR have typically used sand-pack columns, which provide a convenient bench-scale approach to evaluate oil recovery for several reasons: it is an economic model; a battery of columns can be set up simultaneously; and they simulate oil recovery operations of oil reservoirs2. In this study, a sand-pack column model was used to study the effect of biosurfactant-producing and oil-degrading microorganisms isolated from crude oil samples on the mobilization of entrapped oil. For that purpose the degradation of a solid paraffin mixture was studied for different Bacillus species, as well as evaluated the additional recovery of liquid paraffin in the sand-pack columns by the action of three Bacillus subtilis species.\n5.3.\tMaterials and Methods\n5.3.1.\tReservoir and Fluid Characteristics\nThe studied reservoir is characterized by alternated oil and water sand layers, with an average porosity of 25% and a permeability of 50 mD. The reservoir is a flat structure at 450 m depth, with no natural pressure support and with an initial pressure and temperature of 32.4 bars and 42.5\u00b0C, respectively. The oil is paraffinic, with low viscosity, high pour point and a gravity of 25\u00b0 API, with no gas dissolved. Due to these properties, the wells cannot flow naturally and the production has to be lifted. Based on these characteristics, the reservoir is a good candidate for MEOR application as a process to enhance the fluid flow and the ultimate recovery of the reservoir.\n5.3.2.\tIsolation of Microorganisms from Oil Samples\nCrude oil samples obtained from four different wells of the studied reservoir were collected in sterile bottles. For the isolation of microorganisms, enrichment cultures were prepared in 500 mL glass bottles containing 250 mL of Raymond medium supplemented with 1% (v/v) n-hexadecane as the sole carbon source. Crude oil samples (5 mL) were transferred to the bottles and incubated at 40\u00b0C for one month. To isolate bacterial strains, samples (200 pl.) of the enrichment cultures were periodically spread on LB agar plates that were incubated at 40\u00b0C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. After incubation, morphologically different colonies were re-isolated by transfer to fresh agar plates at least three times to obtain pure cultures. Isolates purity was verified through microscopic observation of Gram stained cultures. Pure cultures were stored at -80\u00b0C in LB medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol.\nThe composition of Raymond medium was (g.L-1): NaCl 50.0; Na2HPO4 3.0; NH4NO3 2.0; KH2PO4 2.0; yeast extract 0.5; MgSO4.7H2O 0.2; Na2CO3 0.1; MnSO4.4H2O 0.02; CaCl2 0.01; FeSO4 0.01; supplemented with 1% (v/v) n-hexadecane. The composition of LB medium was (g.L-1): NaCl 10.0; tryptone 10.0; yeast extract 5.0. Both media were adjusted to pH 7.0.\n5.3.3.\tScreening of Biosurfactant-producing Strains in Mineral Media\nThe bacterial strains were grown in Mineral Salt Solution (MSS) with and without n-hexadecane (1%, v/v) at 40\u00b0C. The MSS consisted of (g.L-1): NaCl 10.0; sucrose 10.0; Na2HPO4 5.0; NH4NO3 2.0; KH2PO4 2.0; MgSO4.7H2O 0.2. The pH was adjusted to 7.0.\nA single colony of each isolate was taken from the plate and transferred to 30 mL of MSS. Anaerobic cultures were prepared removing oxygen by aseptically bubbling oxygen-free nitrogen into the flasks, which were sealed with rubber stoppers. Cultures were incubated at 40\u00b0C and 120 rpm. Samples were taken at different time points during the fermentation to determine biomass concentration and biosurfactant production. Bacterial growth was determined by measuring the optical density at 600 nm. Afterwards, the samples were centrifuged (10000 x g, 20 min, 10\u00b0C) and the cell-free supernatants were used to measure surface tension and emulsifying activity.\n5.3.4.\tSurface-activity Determination\nSurface tension measurements of culture broth supernatants were performed according to the Ring method described elsewhere3. A KRUSS K6 Tensiometer (KRUSS GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) equipped with a 1.9 cm Du Nouy platinum ring was used. To increase the accuracy of the surface tension measurements, an average of triplicates was determined. All the measurements were performed at room temperature (20\u00b0C). Isolates which reduced the culture broth surface tension below 40 mN.m-1 were considered biosurfactant producers.\n5.3.5.\tEmulsifying Activity Determination\nEmulsifying activity was determined by the addition of 2 mL of n-hexadecane to the same volume of cell-free culture broth supernatant in glass test tubes. The tubes were mixed with vortex at high speed for 2 min and then incubated at 25\u00b0C for 24 h. The\nstability of the emulsion was determined after 24 h, and the emulsification index (E24) was calculated as the percentage of the height of the emulsified layer (mm) divided by the total height of the liquid column (mm). Emulsions formed by the different isolates were compared with those formed by a 1% (w/v) solution of the synthetic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) in demineralized water. All emulsification indexes were performed in triplicate.\n5.3.6.\tIdentification of the Isolates\nBacterial isolates that displayed high biosurfactant production were selected and identified by partial 16S rRNA sequencing. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified by PCR using the primers 341F and 907R. The resulting sequences were compared with sequences in the GenBank database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) using the nucleotide-nucleotide blast (BLASTn) network service, to determine their phylogenetic affiliations.\n5.3.7.\tHydrocarbon Degradation Determination\nThe ability of three isolated microorganisms to degrade paraffinic mixtures at anaerobic conditions was evaluated. A basal mineral salt medium (BMSM) supplemented with a paraffinic mixture containing n-alkanes between C20-C30 was used. The BMSM contained (g.L-1): KH2PO4 5.0; NaNOs 2.0; MgSO4.7H2O 0.25; K2HPO4.3H2O 1.0; (NH4)2SO4 1.0; NaCl 5.0.\nFlasks containing 50 mL of culture media supplemented with 0.1% or 1% (w/v) of sterile solid paraffin wax with a melting point of 50-52\u00b0C (purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, USA) were sealed with rubber stoppers. Anaerobic cultures were prepared removing oxygen by aseptically bubbling oxygen-free nitrogen into the flasks. Cultures were incubated at 40\u00b0C and 150 rpm during 15 days in anaerobic conditions along with control flasks incubated at the same conditions without addition of microorganisms.\nAt the end of the treatment the paraffinic mixture was quantified via the extraction of the residual solid paraffin in the culture media using an equal volume of dichloromethane, and the extract was dried and weighed accurately. The control was extracted via the same method and the percentage (w/w) of solid paraffin degradation\nestimated. The organic phase extracted was then diluted (20 mg.mL-1) in dichloromethane for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. GC analysis of each sample were performed with CP 3800 Varian gas Chromatograph equipped with and on-column injection, FID detector, and DB-5HT capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm i.d., 0.1 pm thickness) (J&amp;W Scientific Inc., California, USA). Helium was used as gas carrier and a constant flow rate of 2 mL.min-1 was set. Injector and detector temperatures were 350 and 370\u00b0C, respectively. Oven temperature was set at 50\u00b0C during 1 min, raised to 350\u00b0C at the rate of 10\u00b0C.min-1, and at last kept at 370\u00b0C during 1 min. All the samples were analyzed in triplicate.\n5.3.8.\tSand-pack Column Assays\nSand-pack columns were designed to simulate the oil reservoir and used to evaluate the effect of microorganisms in the oil recovery (Figure 5.1). Vertically oriented acrylic columns with a volume of 250 mL were uniformly packed with acid washed dry sand. The columns were provided with a sieve and cap fixed at the bottom. After packing the sand tightly, a top sieve and cap were fixed. The caps on both the ends of the column were provided with holes for insertion of inlet and outlet tubes. Rubber \u2018O' rings surrounded the caps to hermetically seal the column.\nFigure 5.1 Illustration of the sand-pack column model used to evaluate the mobilization of residual oil by microorganisms. Adapted from Suthar et al.2.\nThe experiments were carried out at 40\u00b0C. The column was first flooded with water at a constant flow rate of 3 mL.min-1; the pore volume (PV, mL), defined as the empty volume of the model, was calculated by measuring the volume of water required to saturate the column. The porosity (%) of the column was calculated as the PV divided by the total volume of the column (250 mL). In the second step, liquid paraffin was injected into the column in the same way to replace water, until there was no more water coming out from the effluent. The volume of paraffin required to saturate the column was 200 mL. Original oil in place (OOIP, mL) was calculated as the volume of paraffin retained in the column. Initial oil saturation (Soi, %) and initial water saturation (Swi, %) were calculated as follows:\nS0 \u00a1( %) = \u00b0\u00b0P X 1 0 0\tEquation 5.1\nSwi( %) = PVp\u00b0\u00b0IP X 1 0 0\tEquation 5.2\nThe sand-pack column was incubated at 40\u00b0C for 24 h and afterwards flooded again with water to remove the excess of paraffin, until no more paraffin was observed in the effluent. The amount of paraffin recovered, so called oil recovered after water flooding (Sorwf, mL) was determined volumetrically. Residual oil saturation (Sor) was calculated as follows:\nS 0 r( %) = \u00b0\u00b0ooISprwf X 1 0 0\tEquation 5.3\nThe residual oil was subjected to microbial recovery processes. The column was inoculated with 50 mL of the different isolates in MSS (OD600nm= 0.2), sealed and incubated for 14 days at 40\u00b0C. After incubation, the column was flooded with water and the volume of paraffin recovered (oil recovered after microbial flooding (Sormf, mL)) was measured. Additional Oil Recovery (AOR, %) was calculated as follows:\nA 0 R ( % ) = \u2014\u2014 X 1 0 0\tEquation 5.4\nOOIP Sorwf\n5.4.\tResults and Discussion\n5.4.1.\tScreening of Biosurfactant-Producing Strains\nA total of 58 isolates were obtained from crude oil samples. Biosurfactant production was evaluated in MSS under anaerobic conditions at 40\u00b0C. Five of the isolates were found to produce biosurfactants under anaerobic conditions (Table 5.1). The surface tension values were determined six times at room temperature (20\u00b0C) and the emulsification indexes were calculated three times at 25\u00b0C (results presented in Table\n5.1\trepresent the average of three independent experiments \u00b1 standard deviation). Furthermore, all isolates were identified as B. subtilis according to the partial sequence of their 16S rRNA genes. Biosurfactant production was not negatively affected by the presence of n-hexadecane (MSSH) in the culture broth. The best results regarding biosurfactant production were obtained with the isolates #309, #311 and #573. Those isolates reduced the surface tension of the culture broth to values around 30 mN.m-1 and exhibited emulsifying indexes from 24 to 34%.\nTable 5.1 Surface tension values (ST, mN.m-1) and emulsifying indexes (E24, %) obtained with the different isolates grown in MSS and MSSH for 120 h at 40\u00b0C and 120 rpm under anaerobic conditions.\n\tMSS\t\tMSSH\t\nStrain\tST / (mN.m-1)\tE24 / (%)\tST / (mN.m-1)\tE24 / (%)\n#191\t41.7 \u00b1 1.2\t14.6 \u00b1 1.9\t40.0 \u00b1 2.0\t13.3 \u00b1 5.9\n#309\t31.4 \u00b1 1.3\t25.9 \u00b1 4.2\t31.4 \u00b1 0.5\t24.6 \u00b1 5.3\n#311\t30.5 \u00b1 0.1\t8.5 \u00b1 4.0\t31.0 \u00b1 0.6\t34.2 \u00b1 3.9\n#551\t51.6\u00b1 1.5\t7.1 \u00b1 1.6\t42.2 \u00b1 2.4\t13.6 \u00b1 4.2\n#573\t31.5 \u00b1 0.4\t24.9 \u00b1 2.3\t33.7 \u00b1 1.4\t19.4 \u00b1 5.6\nControl\t66.4 \u00b1 1.5\t0.0 \u00b1 0.0\t63.3 \u00b1 0.9\t0.0 \u00b1 0.0\nSDS 1%\t39.9 \u00b1 0.4\t55.0 \u00b1 1.7\t39.9 \u00b1 0.4\t55.0 \u00b1 1.7\nMost of the microorganisms potentially useful for application in MEOR in situ belong to the genus Bacillus. Bacillus mojavensis JF-2, a thermotolerant and halotolerant strain isolated from an oil field, grows and produces similar amounts of a lipopeptide biosurfactant under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, reducing the surface tension of the medium below 30 mN.m-1, and is not inhibited by crude oil4, 5. Other strains\nisolated from oil fields and which applicability in MEOR has been demonstrated are Bacillus licheniformis BAS506, 7, B. licheniformis ACO18 and B. subtilis PTCC16969. Taking into account these data and the results obtained with isolates #309, #311 and #573 regarding biosurfactant production, they can be considered good candidates for application in MEOR.\n5.4.2.\tHydrocarbon Degradation\nIn order to evaluate the ability of the isolated B. subtilis strains to degrade the paraffinic oil fraction, a mixture of solid paraffin was incubated with isolates #309, #191 and #551 under anaerobic conditions. The respective anaerobic degradation (%, w/w) of each paraffinic mixture is illustrated in Figure 5.2 and compared with the control sample (incubated without microorganisms).\nFigure 5.2 Values of anaerobic degradation of 0.1% and 1% (w/w) solid paraffin by bacterial isolates after 15 days of incubation at 40\u00b0C and 150 rpm.\nThe isolates studied were able to grow in BMSM medium supplemented with solid paraffinic wax, under anaerobic conditions. After the treatment with #191 and #551 bacterial isolates, the percentage of paraffin degraded was of about 1% (w/w). The highest degradation rates observed (circa 2.5%) were obtained for the isolate #309. Thus, the isolate #309 was selected to further study its ability to degrade a mixture with a lower concentration of solid paraffin wax (0.1%, w/w). The anaerobic degradation (%, w/w) for this system and the respective control sample are also presented in Figure 5.2.\nThe results show that in presence of lower concentrations of paraffin, the strain #309 presents a higher capacity for anaerobic degradation, and degrades approximately 6% (w/w) of solid paraffin. These results are in good agreement with those reported by Etoumi10, which showed that microbial degradation of paraffinic hydrocarbon of crude oil was higher for lower concentrations of crude oil.\nThe paraffin extracted after the treatment with isolate #309 was analyzed by GC and the relative degradation of each \u00ab-alkane was measured. The respective variations of relative weight fraction of each \u00ab-alkane present in the paraffin mixture are illustrated in Figure 5.3.\nwt WnatJOT (%)\nFigure 5.3 Variation of relative weight fraction of \u00ab-alkanes present in solid paraffinic mixture after incubation with isolate #309, for 15 days at 40\u00b0C and anaerobic conditions as compared to the control (error bars show the average error).\nFor both paraffin concentrations the isolate #309 led to a decrease in the alkanes higher than C26, while for the lower paraffin concentration (0.1%, w/w) a decrease in the lower alkanes was also observed suggesting a degradation of the whole range of alkanes above C20 at these conditions. The aerobic degradation of \u00ab-alkanes has been also reported by other authors10-14, however anaerobic studies using B. subtilis strains have not been described. One exception is our recent work15 in which it was studied the anaerobic abilities of different B. subtilis isolates to degrade \u00ab-alkanes. In that work the\nsame isolate (#309) showed identical n-alkanes degradation abilities to higher concentrations of solid paraffin.\n5.4.3.\tSand-pack Columns Assays\nB. subtilis #309, #311 and #573 were selected to perform the oil recovery assays using sand-pack columns. The results obtained are shown in Table 5.2 (results represent the average of three independent experiments \u00b1 standard deviation).\nTable 5.2 Oil recovery in sand-pack columns using isolates #309, #311 and #573.\n\t#309\t#311\t#573\tControl\nPV (mL)\t92.5 \u00b1 3.5\t94.0 \u00b1 3.5\t92.5 \u00b1 3.5\t91.0 \u00b1 1.4\nPorosity (%)\t37.0 \u00b1 1.4\t37.6 \u00b1 1.4\t37.0 \u00b1 1.4\t36.4 \u00b1 0.6\nOOIP (mL)\t88.0 \u00b1 2.8\t89.3 \u00b1 3.8\t87.0 \u00b1 4.2\t87.5 \u00b1 3.5\nSoi (%)\t95.1 \u00b1 0.6\t95.0 \u00b1 0.7\t94.0 \u00b1 1.0\t96.1 \u00b1 2.4\nSwi (%)\t4.9 \u00b1 0.6\t5.0 \u00b1 0.7\t6.0 \u00b1 1.0\t3.9 \u00b1 2.4\nSorwf (mL)\t43.0 \u00b1 0.2\t42.0 \u00b1 1.7\t44.0 \u00b1 0.0\t43.5 \u00b1 2.1\nOOIP-Sorwf (mL)\t45.0 \u00b1 7.1\t47.3 \u00b1 2.1\t43.0 \u00b1 4.2\t44.0 \u00b1 5.7\nSor (%)\t51.0 \u00b1 6.4\t53.0 \u00b1 0.3\t49.4 \u00b1 2.5\t50.2 \u00b1 4.5\nSormf (mL)\t15.8 \u00b1 2.5\t12.3 \u00b1 1.1\t8.5 \u00b1 0.0\t1.8 \u00b1 0.4\nAOR (%)\t35.0 \u00b1 0.0\t23.1 \u00b1 1.2\t19.9 \u00b1 1.9\t4.0 \u00b1 0.4\nAs can be seen from Table 5.2, the pore volume was in the range of 91-94 mL, and the OOIP was between 87.0 and 89.3 mL. Water flooding was able to recover about 42.044.0 mL of the OOIP, leaving about 50% of paraffin unrecovered in the column. When the different isolates were introduced in the column with the appropriate nutrients (MSS) and incubated for 14 days at 40\u00b0C, additional paraffin was recovered. The best result was obtained with the isolate #309, which recovered 35% of the entrapped paraffin; isolates #311 and #573 recovered 23 and 20% of paraffin, respectively. In the control columns, which were incubated in the same conditions but without microorganisms, the amount of paraffin recovered was about 4%, so it can be suggested that the remaining paraffin was recovered due the action of microorganisms. Table 5.3 compiles the recovery efficiencies obtained by other authors in sand-pack column assays in situ using different Bacillus strains isolated from oil reservoirs.\nTable 5.3 Results of additional oil recovery from sand-pack column assays using different Bacillus isolates.\nMicroorganism\tSubstrate\tAOR / (%)\tReference\nB. licheniformis XDS1 B. licheniformis XDS2 Bacillus cereus XDS3\tCrude oil\t4.8-6.9\tShe et al.14\nB. licheniformis BNP29\tCrude oil\t9.3-22.1\tYakimov et al7\nBacillus brevis Bacillus polymyxa B. licheniformis\tParaffinic oil\t18.0\tAlmeida et al16\nB. licheniformis ACO1\tParaffin\t22.0\tDastgheib et al8\nAs can be seen, large additional oil recoveries were obtained with all the isolates and these were particularly important with isolate #309 which was higher than the reported in other studies. The results gathered in the current work show that the isolated microorganisms are promising candidates for application in MEOR processes.\n5.5.\tConclusions\nIn the current work some B. subtilis strains were isolated from crude oil samples from the target reservoir. Five isolates were able to grow and produce extracellular biosurfactants at 40\u00b0C under anaerobic conditions in a culture medium supplemented with hydrocarbons. Those isolates reduced the surface tension of the culture broth to 30 mN.m-1 and were able to emulsify hydrocarbons. The isolate #309 was also capable of degrading a solid paraffinic mixture, mainly the heavier n-alkanes under anaerobic conditions. The simulation of the oil recovery operations using the sand-pack column showed that three isolates (#309, #311 and #573) recovered between 19.8 and 35% of the entrapped oil. These results suggest that stimulation of biosurfactant production and anaerobic degradation of heavy oil fractions in situ can contribute to mobilize the entrapped oil and improve the oil fluidity.\n5.6.\tReferences\n1.\tJinfeng, L., Lijun, M., Bozhong, M., Rulin, L., Fangtian, N., and Jiaxi, Z., The field pilot of microbial enhanced oil recovery in a high temperature petroleum reservoir.

In situ stimulation of biosurfactant-producing and oil-degrading microorganisms reduces the capillary forces retaining the oil inside the reservoir and decreases its viscosity, thus promoting the oil flow and consequently production. In this work, a sand-pack column model was designed to simulate oil recovery operations and to evaluate the mobilization of residual oil by selected microorganisms. Four different hydrocarbon mixtures and three Bacillus subtilis strains isolated from crude oil samples were used. Additional oil recoveries ranged from 6 to 24% depending on the hydrocarbon mixture and microorganism used. Biosurfactant production was observed with all the microorganisms and hydrocarbon mixtures studied. Furthermore, the long chain n-alkanes present in the oils, with the subsequent viscosity reduction, was demonstrated by the first time in sand-pack columns using Bacillus isolates under oxygen limiting conditions. The results obtained suggest that the stimulation of the selected B. subtilis strains in situ can contribute to the mobilization of entrapped oil in mature reservoirs.\nKeywords: MEOR; Bacillus subtilis; biosurfactant; sand-pack column; biodegradation.\n6.2.\tIntroduction\nAs explained in chapter 5, laboratory studies on MEOR using sand-pack columns provide a suitable bench-scale approach to evaluate the oil recovery: it is an economic model; a battery of columns can be set up simultaneously; and they can simulate the oil recovery operations usually conducted in reservoirs1. Thus, following the preliminary sand-pack tests performed with a liquid paraffin mixture, in this work, a sand-pack column model was used to study the effect of three different biosurfactant-producing and oil-degrading B. subtilis strains, previously isolated from crude oil samples (chapter 2), on the mobilization of entrapped oil. Additionally, the degradation of oil hydrocarbons was evaluated in the oils recovered after the MEOR process. Herein four different sources of hydrocarbons were used to study the degradation and oil recovery of the Bacillus subtilis strains isolated with best surface and emulsifying properties.\n6.3.\tMaterial and Methods\n6.3.1.\tHydrocarbon Mixtures\nFour different hydrocarbon mixtures were used: heating oil, viscous paraffin, and two different types of crude oil, Arabian Light and heavy oil. Viscous paraffin was purchased from Merck (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Heating oil (ZibroTM) was obtained from commercial sources. Heavy crude oil was obtained from a Brazilian oil field. Arabian Light oil was kindly provided by GALP (Portugal). The properties of each hydrocarbon mixture are presented in Table 6.1.\nTable 6.1 Properties of the hydrocarbon mixtures: viscosity (n), density (p), API gravity (API) and n-alkanes range. Viscosity and density values were measured at 40\u00b0C.\nHydrocarbon mixture\tn / (mPa.s)\tP / (g.cm-3)\tAPI\t\u00ab-alkanes range\nHeating oil\t1.34\t0.76\t-\tC16 - C30\nViscous paraffin\t44.64\t0.85\t-\t*\nArabian light oil\t8.33\t0.86\t29.7\u00b0\tC11 - C24\nHeavy crude oil\t73.91\t0.90\t25.5\u00b0\tC14 - C32\n* Mainly composed of ramified hydrocarbons. The n-alkane composition was not determined.\n6.3.2.\tMicroorganisms\nThree B. subtilis strains (#309, #311 and #573) previously isolated from crude oil samples obtained from a Brazilian oil field at depths of 300-400 m2 were used. These isolates produced extracellular biosurfactants with high surface and emulsifying activities at 40\u00b0C under anaerobic conditions in medium supplemented with hydrocarbons. Furthermore, the isolates degraded the large alkyl chains of hydrocarbon mixtures under anaerobic conditions, reducing their viscosity. However, the three isolates exhibit some differences regarding the biosurfactants produced and their hydrocarbon degradation profiles2, 3. These characteristics make them good candidates for application in the oil reservoir under study. The isolates were stored at -80\u00b0C in LB medium supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol.\n6.3.3.\tSand-pack Column Assays\nSand-pack columns were designed to simulate the oil reservoir and used to evaluate the effect of microorganisms in enhanced oil recovery. Vertically oriented acrylic columns with a volume of 250 mL were uniformly packed with dry sand (previously sterilized). The columns were provided with a sieve and cap fixed at the bottom. After packing the sand tightly, a top sieve and cap were fixed. The caps on both the ends of the column were provided with holes for insertion of inlet and outlet tubes. Rubber \u2018O' rings surrounded the caps to hermetically seal the column (Figure 5.1).\nThe experiments were carried out at 40\u00b0C and different hydrocarbon mixtures were used, as described above (Figure 6.2). The column was first flooded with water at a constant flow rate of 3 mL.min-1. Pore volume (PV, mL), defined as the empty volume of the model, was calculated by measuring the volume of water required to saturate the column. The porosity (%) of the column was calculated as the PV divided by the total volume of the column (250 mL). In the second step, in the same way the hydrocarbon mixture (previously sterilized) was injected into the column to replace water, until there was no more water coming out from the effluent. Original oil in place (OOIP, mL) was calculated as the volume of hydrocarbon retained in the column. Initial oil saturation (Soi, %) and initial water saturation (Swi, %) were calculated as follows:\nS0 \u00a1( %) = \u00b0\u00b0P X 1 0 0\tEquation 6.1\nSwi( %) = PVp\u00b0\u00b0IP X 1 0 0\tEquation 6.2\nThe sand-pack column was incubated at 40\u00b0C for 24 h and afterwards flooded again with water to remove the excess of hydrocarbon mixture, until no more hydrocarbon mixture was observed in the effluent. The amount of hydrocarbon mixture recovered, so-called oil recovered after water flooding (Sorwf, mL) was determined volumetrically. Residual oil saturation (Sor) was calculated as follows:\nS 0r(%) = \u00b0\u00b0ooISprWf X 1 0 0\tEquation 6.3\nFurther, the residual oil was subjected to microbial recovery processes. The column was inoculated with 50 mL of the different microorganisms in MSS culture medium (OD600nm= 0.2), sealed and incubated for 14 days at 40\u00b0C. Control columns were\ninoculated only with MSS and incubated at the same conditions. The MSS medium consisted of (g.L-1): NaCl 10.0; Na2HPO4 5.0; KH2PO4 2.0; MgSO4.7H2O 0.2; sucrose 10.0. After incubation, the column was flooded with water and the volume of hydrocarbon mixture recovered (oil recovered after microbial flooding (Sormf, mL)) was measured. Whenever required, the samples were centrifuged to break the emulsion formed. Additional Oil Recovery (AOR, %) was calculated as follows:\nAO R ( %) =\n\u2014S\u00b0rmf\tx 100\nOOIP Sorwf\nEquation 6.4\nAll the experiments were performed in triplicate.\nSATURATION OF SAND-PACK COLUMN WITH WATER\nSATURATION OF SAND-PACK COLUMN WITH OIL\nWATER FLOODING(I)\nMICROORGANISMS\n+ NUTRIENTS\nINCUBATION WITH\nMICROORGANISMS\nWATER FLOODING (II)\nResidual Oil Saturation\n14 days\n40\u00b0C\nAdditional Oil Recovered After Microbial Flooding (AOR)\nOil Recovered After Water Flooding\nFigure 6.2 Schematic representation of the sand-pack column process.\n6.3.4.\tHydrocarbon Degradation\nAfter conducting the sand-pack column assays with the different hydrocarbon mixtures and microorganisms, the n-alkanes degradation was evaluated. The oil recovered from the simulated MEOR experiments was diluted (20 mg.mL-1) in dichloromethane for gas chromatography (GC) analysis. GC analysis of each sample was performed using a CP 3800 Varian gas Chromatograph equipped with an on-column injector, FID detector, and DB-HT-SIMDIS capillary column (5 m x 0.53 mm i.d., 0.15 pm thickness) (Agilent J&amp;W Scientific Inc., California, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 18 mL.min-1. Injector and detector temperatures were 350 and 370\u00b0C, respectively. For Arabian Light and heavy crude oil samples, the oven temperature was set at 40\u00b0C during 5 min, raised to 350\u00b0C at a rate of 5\u00b0C.min-1, and at last kept at 370\u00b0C during 15 min. For heating oil samples, the oven temperature was set at 40\u00b0C during 8 min, raised to 300\u00b0C at a rate of 5\u00b0C.min-1, and at last kept at 300\u00b0C during 15 min. The n-alkanes degradation was evaluated by comparing the composition of hydrocarbons recovered after the treatment (with different microorganisms) with the hydrocarbons recovered in the abiotic control assays. All the samples were analyzed in triplicate.\n6.3.5.\tViscosity\nThe dynamic viscosity (n) measurements were carried out using an automated Anton Paar (model SVM 3000) rotational Stabinger viscosimeter-densimeter at 50\u00b0C and at atmospheric pressure (approximately 0.1 MPa). The viscosity of hydrocarbons recovered after the treatment with the different isolates was compared with the hydrocarbons recovered in the abiotic control columns. The relative uncertainty in dynamic viscosity measurements is \u00b1 0.35%.\n6.3.6.\tBiosurfactant Production in Sand-pack Columns\nB. subtilis isolates used in this study have been previously found to produce biosurfactants both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions in the presence of different hydrocarbons in liquid medium2. In order to evaluate biosurfactant production in sandpack columns, mini-sand-pack columns were prepared in 15 mL tubes. The tubes were uniformly packed with autoclaved dry sand. After that, the corresponding hydrocarbon mixture (previously sterilized) was introduced into the mini-column to attain the same\npercentage obtained in the sand-pack columns after the water flooding process. The remaining pore volume of the columns was saturated with a suspension of the corresponding microorganism in MSS medium (OD600nm = 0.2). Afterwards, the columns were sealed and incubated at 40\u00b0C for 14 days. Control columns were prepared in the same way but without addition of microorganisms. At the end of the incubation period, the content of each column was transferred to 50 mL test tubes. 5 mL of distilled water were added and the tubes were mixed using vortex for 2 min to extract the biosurfactants. The resulting mixture was centrifuged (9000 rpm, 30 min); the remaining hydrocarbon mixture was removed and the supernatant was filtered (0.2 Lim) to remove residual hydrocarbon, sand and cells. The surface tension of the supernatants was determined according to the Ring method (as described by Gudina et al. ) using a KRUSS K6 Tensiometer (KRUSS GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). These surface tension values were then used to calculate the concentration of biosurfactant using a calibration curve (surface tension versus biosurfactant concentration). The calibration curves were calculated for each strain using different concentrations of the corresponding crude biosurfactant (isolated as described by Gudina et al. ) in distilled water below the critical micelle concentration (cmc). In this biosurfactant concentration range there is a linear relationship between biosurfactant concentration and surface tension. Therefore, whenever adequate, the supernatants obtained from the sand-pack columns were diluted to guarantee that biosurfactant concentrations were below the cmc.\n6.4.\tResults and Discussion\n6.4.1.\tSand-pack Column Assays\nB. subtilis #309, #311 and #573 were used to perform the oil recovery assays with different hydrocarbon mixtures using sand-pack columns.

The OOIP values, the amount of hydrocarbon removed during the water flooding process (Sorwf) and the amount of entrapped hydrocarbon (OOIP-Sorwf) varied depending on the hydrocarbon mixture used (Table 6.2). These differences are most probably due to the different viscosities of the oils.\nWhen the different isolates were incubated for 14 days at 40\u00b0C into the columns together with appropriate nutrients (MSS medium), an additional hydrocarbon recovery was observed for all cases as compared to the controls. However, different outcomes were obtained depending on the hydrocarbon mixture used (Table 6.2).\nThe isolate #573 was the most effective when heating oil was used as hydrocarbon (25% of additional oil recovered (AOR) after incubation with microorganisms). However, in the experiments conducted with viscous paraffin, the highest AOR values (26-28%) were obtained with isolates #309 and #311. Regarding the experiments performed with crude oil, using Arabian Light, the highest recovery was obtained with the isolate #573 (22%), whereas with heavy crude oil similar oil recoveries were obtained with the three isolates (15-17%).\nAs shown in Table 6.3, enhanced oil recovery has been demonstrated by several authors with different hydrocarbon mixtures in sand-pack columns or cores after growing in situ different Bacillus strains which have been reported to produce surface-active compounds. The AOR values reported were between 5 and 22%. In some cases, the strains produced also extracellular polymers, which can contribute to enhance oil recovery as they increase the efficiency of the water-flooding operation4.\nTable 6.3 Additional oil recoveries obtained with sand-pack column or core assays using different Bacillus isolates reported in the literature.\nMicroorganism\tSubstrate\tAOR / (%)\tReference\nB. liche\u00abiformis XDS1, XDS2 Bacillus cereus XDS3\tCrude oil\t4.8-6.9\tShe et al.4\nB. liche\u00abiformis BNP29\tCrude oil\t9.3-22.1\tYakimov et al.3\nBacillus brevis\t\t\t\nBacillus polymyxa\tParaffinic oil\t18.0\tAlmeida et al.5\nB. liche\u00abiformis\t\t\t\nB. liche\u00abiformis ACO1\tParaffin\t21.7\tDastgheib et al.6\n6.4.2.\tEvaluatio\u00ab of Hydrocarbo\u00ab Degradatio\u00ab\nIn order to evaluate the degradation of the different hydrocarbon mixtures after being recovered from the sand-pack column assays performed with B. subtilis isolates #309, #311 and #573, the oils recovered were analyzed by GC and the relative degradation of each \u00ab-alkane was measured and compared with the oils recovered in the abiotic control columns (abiotic controls were subjected to the same incubation period and flood processes, to avoid the possible effect of the loss of hydrocarbons which may be retained in the system during the process). The oil recovered from the viscous paraffin experiments could not be analyzed by GC, since this hydrocarbon mixture was mainly composed of ramified hydrocarbons. The respective variations of relative weight fraction of each \u00ab-alkane present in the different oil samples, as compared with the control assays, are illustrated in Figure 6.3.\nFigure 6.3 Variation of relative weight fraction of n-alkanes present in the different oil samples (Heating oil, Arabian Light Oil and Heavy Crude Oil) after B. subtilis isolates #309, #311 and #573 incubation for 14 days at 40\u00b0C in sand-pack columns. Results are compared to control columns and error bars represent the average error of three independent assays.\nAs observed by the GC analysis, the three hydrocarbon mixtures recovered after the treatment with the strains #309, #311 and #573 were degraded. It was also observed that all the B. subtilis strains preferentially degrade the higher \u00ab-alkane fractions of each hydrocarbon mixture.\nAnalyzing the results obtained with heating oil, it was found that all the isolates degraded the higher \u00ab-alkanes (C25-C30), causing an increase in \u00ab-alkanes in the C19C24 range with respect to the original oil. The isolate #311 showed the highest degradation. The Arabian Light Oil was composed of \u00ab-alkanes up to C24. In this case, the oil recovered after the sand-pack column assays showed a reduction in \u00ab-alkanes higher than C19 for isolates #309 and #311; and higher than C21 for isolate #573. As in the case of heating oil, the highest degradation rate was obtained with the isolate #311. The GC analysis also shows an increase in the percentages of C17 and C18 \u00ab-alkanes when compared with the controls, perhaps due to the increase of the isoprenoids (pristane and phytane) compositions.\nThe study of \u00ab-alkanes variation of the heavy crude oil recovered shows that all the strains are able to degrade the hydrocarbon chains higher than C27. Among them, the isolate #311 exhibited the highest degradation rate with an increase in the relative weight fraction of \u00ab-alkanes lower than C19, and a decrease in the percentage of \u00ab-alkanes higher than C18. These results indicate that this isolate degraded the higher \u00ab-alkanes into lighter ones during the sand-pack column assays. Similarly, the isolate #573 shows the ability to degrade the long chain \u00ab-alkanes (>C25), thus increasing the percentage of \u00ab-alkanes with chains containing 20 carbons or less than 17 carbons, when compared with the control sample. On the other hand, the isolate #309 displays a different oil degradation profile, degrading the higher \u00ab-alkanes (>C28) as well as the lower ones (chains lower than 17 carbons).\no\nSeveral microorganisms able to degrade heavy oil hydrocarbons have been described8, but only a few reports refer Bacillus species as oil degraders. Bacillus thermoleovora\u00abs strains with the ability of degrading \u00ab-alkanes up to C23 at 70\u00b0C were isolated by Kato et al.9. A thermophilic Bacillus strain that degraded long-chain (C15 to C36) rather than short-chain \u00ab-alkanes was isolated by Wang et al.10. Bacillus strains isolated from a Brazilian oil reservoir were found to degrade \u00ab-alkanes of Arabian Light and Marlin oil . Das and Mukherjee reported that B. subtilis DM-04 preferentially degraded\ncrude oil n-alkanes between C14 and C30. She et al.5 studied three Bacillus strains isolated from an oil reservoir in the Daqing Oilfield (China) which degraded n-alkanes with chain lengths between C14 and C26. However, all these assays were performed under aerobic conditions. Recently, our group showed the ability of the three B. subtilis strains used in the current study to preferentially degrade the large alkyl chains of different paraffinic mixtures under anaerobic conditions . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that degradation of n-alkanes of different hydrocarbon mixtures in sand-pack columns using Bacillus species is demonstrated. The most common pathway, for n-alkanes degradation under aerobic conditions is via terminal oxidation, in which n-alkanes are first oxidized to the corresponding primary alcohol, which is further oxidized by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases. Although the conditions existent in the sand-pack columns are not strictly anaerobic, the oxygen present must be quicly consumed by the microorganisms, so it is still not clear how the n-alkanes degradation can occur under oxygen limiting conditions. Several authors have reported in the last years the degradation of n-alkanes under anaerobic conditions using microorganisms, even strict anaerobic bacteria13-19. However, the pathways involved in this process have not yet been elucidated, although many researchers have suggested that nitrate can work as an alternative electron acceptor for hydrocarbon degradation under anaerobic conditions17, 19\nThe results herein obtained using different hydrocarbon mixtures (including heavy crude oil) were similar to the ones previously reported in liquid medium2, thus suggesting that these isolates can be used to reduce the percentage of long chain n-alkanes of crude oil also in porous media (sand-pack column). The comparison between different hydrocarbons showed that even changing their n-alkanes composition, the different isolates maintained the ability to degrade preferentially the heavier oil fractions. Therefore, these results are very interesting in view of their application in MEOR processes in reservoirs containing heavy and paraffinic oils.\nAs a result of the degradation of high n-alkanes present in the crude oil into lighter ones, a reduction in oil viscosity is expected, with the subsequent improvement in the flow properties. The viscosity of the heavy crude oil recovered after the sand-pack column assays was measured, and the respective variation relatively to the control samples (oil recovered from the abiotic control columns) is presented in Table 6.4.\nTable 6.4 Relative viscosities variation (An) (at 50\u00b0C) of heavy crude oil recovered from sand-pack column assays using B. subtilis isolates #309, #311 and #573 relatively to the control (the associated errors are lower than 6%).\n\tBacillus subtilis isolates\t\t\n\t#309\t#311\t#573\nAn / (%)\t-21.4\t-28.7\t-32.0\nn of the heavy crude oil (control) at 50\u00b0C / (mPa.s)\t\t\t37.6\nThe results presented in Table 6.4 show that the viscosity of heavy crude oil samples recovered after the sand-pack column assays was reduced when compared with the control samples. The viscosity of the crude oil decreased more than 20% in all the examples after the treatment with microorganisms, being the isolate #573 the one that promotes the highest viscosity reduction (32%).\nThe reduction in oil viscosity is in close agreement with the AOR values obtained for each microorganism, as a direct relationship was observed between the increase in oil recovered and the decrease of oil viscosity. These results are expectable since the reduction in oil viscosity enhances the oil fluidity in the reservoir.\n6.4.3.\tBiosurfactant Production in Sand-pack Columns\nThe results obtained regarding biosurfactant production by the different microbial isolates in sand-pack columns are shown in Table 6.5. As it can be seen from those results, all the isolates produced biosurfactants in sand-pack columns with the different hydrocarbons tested. In the control columns, no biosurfactant production was observed. For all the cases evaluated, the lowest biosurfactant production was obtained with the isolate #573, whereas isolates #309 and #311 produced similar amounts of biosurfactant. Furthermore, for all isolates, the lowest biosurfactant production was obtained when using heating oil was used as hydrocarbon mixture.\nTable 6.5 Biosurfactant concentrations (mg.L-1) obtained in the mini-sand-pack column assays performed with the different isolates and hydrocarbon mixtures.

As reported by several authors, low biosurfactant concentrations (close to the cmc) are enough to mobilize entrapped oil20-22, although their effect depends on the system studied. Even biosurfactant concentrations lower than the cmc can contribute to mobilize entrapped oil23. The cmc values determined for the crude biosurfactants produced by isolates #309, #311 and #573 were 20, 20 and 30 mg.L-1, respectively2. Taking into account these values, for isolate #573 the amount of biosurfactant produced was lower than the cmc in all the cases (except for heavy crude oil). Likewise, biosurfactants production by isolates #309 and #311 with heating oil was below their cmc. However, with the other hydrocarbon mixtures, the concentration of biosurfactant produced was approximately four times the cmc. According to these results, it can be suggested that for all hydrocarbon mixtures evaluated, the biosurfactants produced contributed to enhance the oil recovery.\nAs previously mentioned, sand-pack columns provide a suitable approach to study the ability of injected microorganisms to increase oil recovery in reservoirs, because these models allow the simulation of oil recovery operations in oil fields. After the water flooding process, residual oil is trapped in the pores of the reservoir rocks. Biosurfactants produced by microorganisms reduce the interfacial tension at the oilwater-rock interface, thus reducing the capillary forces that prevent oil from moving through rock pores.\nThe increases in oil recovery observed in sand-pack columns can be due to several factors, and it is not straightforward to assign a percentage of recovery to a specific one. B. subtilis isolates used in this study produce biosurfactants which reduce surface tension and emulsify hydrocarbons, decreasing the interfacial tension at the oil-water interface. In sand-pack column assays performed with heating oil and viscous paraffin, the lowest recoveries were obtained with isolate #573. This isolate was also found to exhibit the lowest biosurfactant production with both hydrocarbons. However, with the other hydrocarbon mixtures studied, a direct relationship between biosurfactant production and the amount of oil recovered is not evident. Furthermore, the microorganisms herein used have the ability of degrading long-chain n-alkanes, reducing oil viscosity, which can contribute to enhance the mobilization of the hydrocarbon into the column. In sand-pack column assays performed with heavy crude oil, the highest recoveries were obtained with isolate #573, which was found to produce less biosurfactants than the other two isolates. However, this was the isolate that caused the highest reduction in crude oil viscosity. Indeed, as previously mentioned there are other factors that can contribute to the increase in oil recovery, such as the production of gases by the microbial isolates, increasing the pressure into the column; or the plugging of high permeability channels due to the accumulation of biomass, which redirects water to oil rich zones, thus increasing oil production.\nIn field assays, inoculation of mature oil wells with Bacillus strains resulted in biosurfactant production (20-90 mg.L-1) and in an increase in oil production in the inoculated wells, as well as in a decrease in the water/oil ratio. These figures were maintained for a period of 40-60 days following the treatment, therefore constituting a cost effective process20, 24\n6.5.\tConclusion\nB. subtilis isolates were evaluated for their oil-degrading and biosurfactant-production capabilities in sand-pack columns. For the first time, degradation of n-alkanes by Bacillus species in sand-pack columns under oxygen limiting conditions was demonstrated. Different hydrocarbon mixtures were studied and the isolates were able to increase the oil recovery in all cases, 6-25% for heating oil, 16-24% for viscous paraffin, 13-18% for Arabian light oil and 15-17% for heavy crude oil. In situ treatment of heavy and paraffinic oils with B. subtilis can thus contribute to improve the entrapped\noil fluidity and to reduce interfacial tension, increasing the additional oil recoveries. These isolates are good candidates for use in MEOR process and may be useful to recover residual oil from mature reservoirs.\n6.6.\tReferences\n1.\tSuthar, H., Hingurao, K., Desai, A., and Nerurkar, A., Evaluation of bioemulsifier mediated Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery using sand pack column.

Thus, from several isolates were obtained from 4 Brazilian crude oil samples and which were used to produce compounds with surface-emulsifying properties, as well as biodegradability properties. Several bacterial strains were recovered under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, belonging mostly to the Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa species. The biosurfactants produced by those isolates present some interesting properties, such as salt-, thermo- and pH-tolerance, and abilities to reduce the surface tension of water and to emulsify different sources of hydrocarbons. Therefore, the compounds produced by P. aeruginosa and B.subtilis isolates with best surfaceactivities and emulsifying properties were then characterized. The biosurfactants produced by two different P.aeruginosa strains were identified using MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS/MS as mixtures of mono-rhamnolipids and di-rhamnolipids. On the other hand, the chemical characterization of the compounds produced by three isolates of Bacillus subtilis shows that they are mainly constituted of surfactins with a heptapeptide moiety (L-Glu-L-Leu-D-Leu-L-Val-L-Asp-D-Leu-L-Leu) linked to a C13, C14 or C15 hydroxy fatty acid chain.\nThe isolates with best results relatively to the biosurfactants production in the reservoir conditions (40\u00b0C and under anaerobic conditions) were B.subtilis #309, #311 and #573. Thus, after the optimization of these conditions in order to produce higher concentrations of biosurfactants, and higher n-alkanes biodegradation, some assays of MEOR in sand-pack columns were then performed using those isolates. The MEOR sand-pack columns tests were optimized with different hydrocarbon sources, and it was possible to obtain additional oil recoveries of 6-25% for heating oil, 16-24% for viscous paraffin, 13-18% for Arabian Light oil and 15-17% for heavy crude oil. In addition, those strains were able to reduce the percentage of heavier fractions of n-alkanes, and reduce the oils viscosities after the bacterial treatment in the sand-pack columns. In conclusion, these results, although conducted at a lab-scale, suggest that these isolates can be applied in the oil reservoirs in order to improve the entrapped oil fluidity, to reduce the interfacial water-oil-rock tension and consequently increase the recovery of residual crude oil from mature oilfields.\n7.2.\tFuture Work\nThe bioprocess described in part A of this thesis addresses a systematic study on the use of microorganisms as a new alternative to be applied in Enhanced Oil Recovery assays. The B. subtilis strains isolated and identified in this work show interesting properties at lab-scale suggesting that they can be promising strains to be used at a pilot-scale and in field pilot-studies. Besides all the studies here carried out, some new investigations should be considered and conducted in order to achieve a sustainable bioprocess at an industrial scale. In fact, some of these tests are already in progress and include:\n\u2022\tStudy of consortia of several microorganisms to be applied at lab-scale tests;\n\u2022\tOptimization of sand-pack columns tests, using sand from the reservoir and testing heavy crude oils from other reservoirs;\n\u2022\tStudy of MEOR tests at a pilot scale, aiming not only a scale-up, but also to simulate the reservoirs conditions, namely temperature and pressure.\nMeanwhile, additional work at industrial scale must still be performed and should include:\n\u2022\tStudy of a pilot field of MEOR in a Brazilian crude oil reservoir by an i\u00ab situ treatment with the strains tested at lab- and pilot-scale. This study should comprise the technical design, scale-up optimization, evaluation and monitoring of its technical feasibility and the effectiveness of the isolated strains.\nPART B\nAntibiotics Purification Using Aqueous\nBiphasic Systems Composed of Ionic\nLiquids and Polymers\n122\n8.\tIntroduction\n124\n8.1.\tGeneral Context\nThe second part of this thesis aims at the development of new friendly and environmentally benign separation techniques, namely aqueous biphasic systems composed of ionic liquids and polymers, to replace the conventional liquid-liquid processes which require the use of volatile and hazardous organic solvents, to be employed in the separation and purification of antibiotics.\nAntibiotics are chemical compounds that can be totally or partly synthetized by living microorganisms and that either inhibit the growth or kill other microorganisms. They are currently used worldwide for an effective control of bacteria levels in humans and animals. At a global level the antibiotic market value was of US $42 billion (~ 34 billion \u20ac) in 20091. In the past few years, a number of patents regarding the synthesis and applications of antibiotics and other drugs have expired falling into the public domain2. The pharmaceutical industry is facing now the growth of generic drugs and there is a crucial need to minimize operational costs by optimizing the antibiotics\u2019 production and their purification steps. The high production cost associated to antibiotics results, to a large extent, from the downstream processing, i.e. from the extraction and purification steps. In this context, it is imperative to find and evaluate new extraction/purification techniques which could be cheap, reliable, and easily scaled-up by the biopharmaceutical companies.\nChromatographic techniques (particularly ion exchange chromatography), liquid-liquid or solid-liquid extractions are commonly used for the extraction and purification of antibiotics from the fermentation broth3, 4. Among these techniques, the most used is the liquid-liquid extraction which is typically carried out using organic solvents, namely ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and methanolic trichloroacetic acid (TCA)5. This type of liquid-liquid extraction is a useful technique of low cost and leads to a high purity level. However, these organics compounds present some drawbacks since they are volatile and hazardous to human health3. Aiming at developing not only cheaper, but also safer, biocompatible and sustainable extraction processes, the use of aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) can represent a viable option. ABS are liquid-liquid extraction systems, in which both phases are rich in water, and that can be used for the purification of a wide array of biomolecules by their selective partitioning between the coexisting phases.\n8.2.\tAntibiotics\nThere are several classes of antibiotics, such as P-lactams, aminoglycosides, macrolides and tetracyclines (TCs). Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic antimicrobials produced by Streptomyces aurofaciens or Streptomyces rimosus. They are a broad-spectrum antibiotic since they can be used against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, Coccidian, Trichomonas, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia and Rickettsia. Tetracyclines inhibit the synthesis of bacterial proteins by binding to the small unit (30S) of bacterial ribosome while preventing the access of aminoacyltRNA to the acceptor site on the mRNA-ribosome complex6. Besides their antibiotic properties, tetracyclines also possess anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-neurodegenerative properties6. Due to all their benefits tetracyclines are currently added to animal feed in order to prevent diseases as well as a feed additive to accelerate the growth . The TCs family comprises a wide range of compounds based on the naphthacene core with similar functional groups presenting only minor differences in structure (Figure 8.1). They were reported for the first time in 19488.\nFigure 8.1 Chemical structure of tetracyclines.\n8.3.\tAqueous Biphasic Systems\nAqueous biphasic systems (ABS) are considered a low cost, gentler and biocompatible extraction technique since the extractive phases are mainly composed of water. In ABS, two aqueous phases coexist in equilibrium as a result of the dissolution, at appropriate concentrations, of suitable pairs of solutes (e.g. two polymers, or a polymer and a salt) in water. These systems have shown to be capable of maintaining the native conformation and biological activities of several biomolecules9-11 and they have been satisfactorily tested, for over forty years, for the separation and purification of biological molecules, such as DNA, proteins, enzymes, alkaloids, antibiotics and blood cells,\n12 22\namong others - . These systems were also found valuable in other types of separations, such as the extraction of metal ions and, on the whole, ABS strategies can be considered as a more sustainable alternative to many separations carried out by traditional volatile organic solvents.\nABS were first reported by Beijerinck in 1896, showing that the combination of gelatin, agar and water in certain proportions promoted the formation of two immiscible aqueous rich phases . Nonetheless, it was only in 1958 that Albertsson reported the ability of ABS, formed by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran, to separate biomolecules from aqueous media. PEGs are common polymers of low toxicity, negligible volatility, improved biodegradability and, unlike dextran, of low cost26. Besides the polymer-polymer ABS, in 1986, Albertsson reported the possibility of forming an ABS using a polymer and an inorganic salt . Each phase of these systems becomes enriched in one of the two compounds creating thus two aqueous phases of different chemical and physical nature, which leads to the partitioning of biomolecules between them28. The biomolecules partitioning among the phases results from surface dependent properties, and relies on the hydrophobicity, polarity and charge of the biomolecule, that further determines to which phase the biomolecule will preferentially migrate. More recently, other substances such as proteins, surfactants, sugars, or amino acids, have been used as solutes for ABS formation in combination with either polymers or salts - . Interestingly, the co-dissolution of two salts in water can also generate ABS - . In the latter case, one of the salts typically comprises one or both ions of high charge density (with water-ion interactions stronger than water-water interactions), and thus ions that are preferentially hydrated, while the other salt comprises low charge density ions (with water-ion interactions weaker than water-water interactions)39, 40. The delocalization of charge in the ions of the latter salt inherently implies a lower melting temperature of the salt itself, which often fits within the category of ionic liquids. In this context, in the last decade, a large interest has been devoted to ABS composed of ionic liquids and salts, amino acids, carbohydrates or polymers, as alternative purification\n. 66\nsystems66.\n8.4.\tIonic Liquids\nBy definition ionic liquids (ILs) are purely ionic materials with melting temperatures lower than 100 \u00b0C41. Unlike conventional solvents constituted by molecules, these are\nformed by ions as typical salts; yet, a large range of ILs are liquid at room temperature allowing the mutual combination of the properties afforded by salts and organic solvents. ILs have gained a vast attention from both academia and industry since the late 1990s due to a series of interesting features that they often exhibit42. These interesting properties include an extremely low vapour pressure, melting temperatures around or even well below room temperature, wide liquid temperature range, good chemical and thermal stabilities, the ability to solvate a broad range of compounds, and a considerable degree of tailoring of their properties by a judicious selection of the constitutive ions56,57. Therefore, ILs have been explored in several domains such as in catalysis43-50, analytical chemistry , polymers technology , nanotechnology , among others. However, one of the most promising areas involving ILs relies on their use as alternatives to the conventional volatile organic solvents actually used in separation and reaction processes58-60.\nAs stated before, the possibility of varying, in a large extent, the chemical structures of the ILs ions allows a high degree of tunability in their physical and chemical properties. Therefore, by virtue of their tunability, ILs cover essentially the whole hydrophilicityhydrophobicity range61,62. The estimated number of available anion/cation combinations is larger than one million63. Between them, the most common cations are imidazolium, pyridinium, piperidinium, pyrrolidinium, ammonium, phosphonium, guanidinium and cholinium that can be further combined with a wide variety of organic or inorganic anions. In most cations the substituent groups are alkyl chains of variable size or structure that can also be functionalized. Figure 8.2 depicts some examples of the ILs chemical structures.\nFigure 8.2 Common chemical structures of ionic liquids.\nBased on the solubility of ILs in water, they can be divided into two main categories: hydrophobic (water immiscible) and hydrophilic (water miscible). In particular, the water solubility of ILs is mostly dependent on the constituting anion while the effects of the cation core, alkyl side chain length and functionalized groups have a lower impact although still significant40, 64-65. The existence of hydrophilic ILs, i.e. ILs miscible with water in all composition range, allows their use as ABS-forming solutes. The first advances in this field were reported by Gutowski et al.34 which showed that a hydrophilic IL can form an ABS when in contact with appropriate concentrations of a salting-out inorganic salt. Recently, it was further showed that a wide number of ILs, in presence of inorganic salts, could be used to prepare ABS for the extraction of added-value biomolecules36, 37, 66. It was observed that, as for other applications, it is possible to control the ABS physicochemical properties by a wise combination of IL cations and/or anions, making thus possible the manipulation of the properties of the coexisting phases aiming at attaining enhanced selectivities and yields of the product recovery36, 37 A number of works on the extraction of several biomolecules with IL-based ABS have\nbeen reported within the last couple of years revealing that these novel platforms are by far more effective than the conventional polymer-polymer or polymer-salt ABS36,37,67-71.\n8.5.\tWork Aims and Motivation\nA series of advantages can be associated to the use of ILs as phase forming components of ABS instead of the conventional high-melting inorganic salts. For example, salt crystallization problems can be fully avoided when using an IL which melts below room temperature. Even in the case of an IL melting above room temperature, the presence of water will largely preclude its solidification - the saturation levels of ILs in aqueous solutions are usually significantly higher than those observed with common inorganic salts72, 73. Furthermore, the large number of available hydrophilic ILs may enable the customization of ABS with regard to specific separation or purification challenges.\nThe most critical issue associated to typical ABS composed of two polymers or a polymer and an inorganic salt is the limited range of polarities of their coexisting phases which have been preventing effective extractions, enhanced purification factors and high yields. Some approaches have been developed to overcome this limitation, such as the functionalization of polyethylene glycol (PEG)77-82 or the inclusion of salt additives83-88. The first approach is focused on the modification of the chemical structure of PEGs, while the second is based on inclusion of an additional inorganic salt to manipulate the solute partitioning between the two liquid phases. Nevertheless, it should be remarked the high cost associated to the polymer functionalization limiting thus its application at an industrial scale.\nThe combined use of ILs in conventional polymer-based ABS can be foreseen as an alternative approach to enhance the tunability of these traditional systems89. The first advances reporting the combination of polymers and ILs in aqueous media showed the presence of salting-in and salting-out effects of ILs over the polymer90, 91. Recently, polymer-IL-based ABS were also shown, yet with a series of more hydrophobic polymers, polypropylene glycols (PPGs)92. However, ABS composed of ILs and less hydrophobic polymers, such as PEGs, have not been previously investigated maybe due to the difficulty in separating a more hydrophilic polymer from aqueous media.\nIn this work, and based on the tunability afforded by ILs, the main objective is to develop and characterize novel ABS composed of PEGs and ILs with the final goal of\napplying them to the purification of antibiotics. Besides the direct application of these systems as extractive strategies, due to their novelty, they were initially characterized in terms of their formation capability and molecular level phenomena involved in the liquid-liquid demixing. As a first approach, in chapter 9, it was investigated the use of ILs as additives in typical PEG-Na2SO4 ABS aiming at tuning their intrinsic properties and extraction performance. For this purpose, it was studied the effect of several ILs through the ternary phase diagrams behaviour and on the extraction of L-tryptophan (used here as a model biomolecule). Then, in chapter 10, novel phase diagrams composed of PEGs and ILs were studied for the first time to replace the inorganic salts typically used. Distinct pairs of PEGs and ILs were addressed to better understand the liquid-liquid demixing phenomenon at a molecular level. In chapter 11, it is clear demonstrated the molecular level phenomena that regulate the phase separation in PEG-IL-based ABS by the experimental determination of the complete ternary phase diagrams at two temperatures coupled with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation calculations. In chapter 12, to properly confirm the vast hydrophobic-hydrophilic range afforded by IL-based ABS, it is shown the partitioning behaviour of three dyes used as molecular probes. In chapter 13, it was investigated the aptitude of PEG-IL-based ABS to be employed as extractive platforms making use of three alkaloids of different polarity (caffeine, nicotine and xhantine), in order to demonstrate that ILs are able to control the partitioning of different biomolecules.\nHaving in mind the final goal, the extraction of antibiotics from the fermentation broth, a new class of ABS composed of polymers and more benign and biocompatible cholinium-based ILs was finally studied - chapter 14. In this chapter the novel ternary phase diagrams composed of PEG, cholinium-based ILs and water are presented. To gather additional insights into the main mechanisms which rule the phase behaviour of PEG-IL-based ABS additional experiments were carried out, namely the solubility of ILs in PEGs, together with COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) prediction results. Finally, in the last chapter (chapter 15) it was carried out the extraction of tetracycline directly from a fermentation broth of Streptomyces aureofacie\u00abs employing ABS constituted by PEG 600 and cholinium-based salts.\nThe second part of this thesis was mainly developed in the Chemistry Department of University of Aveiro. I have been involved in the determination of all the experimental\ndata, with the exception of MD simulation calculations (in chapter 11) and COSMO-RS prediction data (shown in chapter 14).\n8.6.\tReferences\n1.\tHamad, B., The antibiotics market.

An innovative study involving the addition of various imidazolium-based ILs to conventional polyethylene glycol (PEG)/inorganic salt aqueous biphasic systems (ABS), aiming at controlling their phase behaviour and extraction capability for L-tryptophan, is carried out here. For this purpose, phase diagrams and respective tie-lines for PEG 600/Na2SO4 ABS with the addition of small quantities of IL were established. In addition, the partition coefficients of L-tryptophan were determined in those systems. The results obtained indicate that the addition of small amounts of IL to the typical PEG/inorganic salt aqueous systems could largely control the extraction efficiency for L-tryptophan, and that efficiency depends on the IL employed. Salting-in inducing ILs enhance the partition coefficient of L-tryptophan for the PEG-rich phase while saltingout inducing ILs decrease the partitioning of the amino acid. These results are an interesting advance in biotechnological separation processes regarding the extraction of biomolecules that could be used instead of the usual approach of PEG functionalization.\nKeywords: Ionic Liquids; Aqueous Biphasic Systems; L-tryptophan; Phase Diagrams; Partition Coefficients.\n9.2.\tIntroduction\nPolyethylene glycols (PEGs) are a class of polymers widely used in industrial processes, especially due to their high biodegradability, low toxicity, low volatility, low melting temperature, large water solubility and low cost. These attractive properties have prompted the use of PEGs in various processes, one of the most interesting being their use as phase forming components of aqueous biphasic systems (ABS)1.\nABS typically formed by polymer and inorganic salt solutions have several advantages over conventional polymer-polymer counterparts2, such as low interfacial tension, lower viscosity, fast and high phase separation rates and low cost, which makes them more viable for downstream processing. However, the hydrophilic nature of PEG limits the applicability of this technique when the goal is to extract hydrophobic biomolecules. To overcome this limitation one possible approach used by some researchers has been the functionalization of PEG3, 4 Rosa et al.5 and Azevedo et al.6 applied the\nfunctionalization of PEG to the purification of human immunoglobulin while Jiang et al. have used an ionic liquid functionalized PEG for the extraction of penicillin. This last approach allowed the modification of the polymer-rich phase hydrophilicity\no\nenhancing the recovery of penicillin. Moreover, Wu et al. have recently shown that PEG can be functionalized with ionic liquids for enhanced extraction and polymer recovery. In summary, these works - aimed at tuning the properties of PEG through the modification of its chemical structure.\nAimed at developing an alternative technique for the modification of the PEG-rich phase characteristics, a new approach making use of ILs is here proposed. Instead of the PEG functionalization, the IL is used here as a promoter or adjuvant of ABS formation aimed at tuning the intrinsic properties of the aqueous phases. The formation of PEG-sodium sulphate ABS, and their phase behaviour, in the presence of various ILs, is investigated. Moreover, the effect of adding distinct ILs as adjuvants for the extraction ability of archetypal ABS is evaluated here using L-tryptophan as a model biomolecule. Influences of the IL and inorganic salt concentrations, temperature, and pH of the medium were discussed throughout the partition coefficients obtained.\n9.3.\tExperimental Section\n9.3.1.\tMaterials\nNivSO.i was purchased from LabSolve (purity > 99.8 wt%), and L-tryptophan (purity > 99.0 wt%) and polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG 600) were provided by Fluka. All reagents were of analytical grade. The following ionic liquids (ILs) were acquired at Iolitec: imidazolium chloride, [im]Cl; 1-methylimidazolium chloride, [CiimjCl; 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [C2mim]Cl; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [C4mim]Cl; 1-butyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride, [C4C1mim]Cl; 1-hydroxyethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [OHC2mim]Cl; 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [amim]Cl; 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [C7H7mim]Cl; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, [C4mim][CH3CO2]; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methylsulphate, [C4mim][MeSO4]; 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogenosulphate, [C4mim][HSO4]. Figure 9.1 shows the chemical structure of the studied ILs. The ILs were dried under constant agitation at vacuum and moderate temperature (353 K), for a minimum of 48 h, to reduce the content of water and volatile compounds to negligible\n1\t13\nvalues. After this procedure, the purity of the ILs was further checked by H and C\nNMR spectra. A weight fraction purity above 99 % was observed for all IL samples. The water used was double distilled, passed across a reverse osmosis system and further treated with a Milli-Q plus 185 water purification apparatus.\nvn\nFigure 9.1 Chemical structures of the studied ILs: (i) [im]Cl; (ii) [C1im]Cl; (iii) [C2mim]Cl; (iv) [C4mim]Cl; (v) [C4C1mim]Cl; (vi) [OHC2mim]Cl; (vii) [amim]Cl; (viii) [C7H7mim]Cl; (ix) [C4mim][CH3CO2]; (x) [C4mim][MeSO4]; (xi) [C4mim][HSO4].\n9.3.2.\tMethods\nxi\n9.3.2.I.\tPhase Diagrams and Tie-Lines\nAqueous solutions of Na2SO4 at 20 wt% + 5 wt% of each IL, aqueous solutions of PEG 600 at 40 wt% + 5 wt% of the same IL, and aqueous solutions of 5 wt% of IL were prepared and used for the determination of the binodal curves. The phase diagrams were determined through the cloud point titration method at 298 (\u00b1 1) K and atmospheric\npressure. The experimental procedure adopted is described in detail elsewhere9, 10. The systems composition was determined by the weight quantification of all components added within an uncertainty of \u00b110-5 g.\nThe tie-lines were determined by a gravimetric method described by Merchuck et al. . For the TLs' determination a mixture at the biphasic region was prepared, vigorously stirred and allowed to reach equilibrium, by the separation of both phases, for 12 h at 298 K using small ampoules (ca. 10 cm3) especially designed for the purpose9, 10. After the equilibration step, the top and bottom phases were separated, recovered and weighed. Each individual TL was determined by the application of the lever arm rule to the relationship between the top mass phase composition and the overall system composition. For that purpose the experimental binodal curves were correlated using equation 9.111.\nY = A exp [(BA o'5) - CX3)]\tEquati on 9.1\nwhere Y and X are, respectively, the PEG and inorganic salt weight percentages, and A, B and C are constants obtained by the regression of the experimental data.\nThe determination of the TLs was accomplished by solving the following system of four equations (equations. (9.2) to (9.5)) for the unknown values of YT, YB, XT and XB.\nY = Aexp |(BX?'!)-(CX-3)]\nYb = Aexp|lB\\. ) (CXB)]\nEquation 9.2\nEquation 9.3\nXT\nXb =\nXM\na\n' 1 -a\n&lt;a\nEquation 9.4\n' 1 -a\n&lt;a\nEquation 9.5\nY\na\nwhere Y and X are respectively, the PEG and inorganic salt weight percentages, and the subscript letters T, B and M represent the top, the bottom and the mixture phase, respectively. The parameter a' is the ratio between the top and the total mass of the mixture.\nThe tie-lines length (TLL) was determined accordingly to equation 9.6:\nTLL = yl(XT - XB)2 + (yT - Y)2\tEquation 9.6\n9.3.2.2.\tPartitioning of L-tryptophan and ILs\nA mixture point into the biphasic region was selected and used to evaluate the L-tryptophan partitioning. An aqueous solution of L-tryptophan at 2.34 g.dm- was used in the water content composition. After 5 min of gently stirring, the biphasic system was allowed to equilibrate for 12 h immersed in a refrigerated water bath, Julabo F34, at each temperature of interest (278.15 K, 288.15 K, 298.15 K, 308.15 K and 318.15 K) within an uncertainty of \u00b1 0.01 K. After that period of equilibration the phases were clear and the interface well defined. The phases were thus carefully separated for further quantification of the amino acid and IL.\n9.3.2.3.\tAmino acid and ILs Quantification\nThe L-tryptophan and IL concentrations, in the top and bottom phases, were determined using an UV spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-1700), at a wavelength of 279 nm and 211 nm, respectively. Calibration curves were established for each compound. Possible interferences of the PEG 600, IL and Na2SO4 in the L-tryptophan analytical method were taken into account and found to be of no significance at the dilutions carried out. Particularly for the aromatic ILs, the maximum peak of absorbance for the studied imidazolium-based ILs is at ca. 211 nm and, given the dilutions carried out in all phases, there was no contribution of the ILs to the absorbance at 279 nm.\n9.3.2.4.\tpH measurements\nAfter the partition of L-tryptophan and phases separation, the pH of each phase was determined using a pH Meter (Hanna Instruments, Model 9321) at 298 K.\n9.4.\tResults and Discussion\n9.4.1.\tPhase Diagrams and Tie-Lines\nThe chemical structures of the studied imidazolium-based ILs are depicted in Figure\n9.1.\tWe have focused on the subgroup of imidazolium halides to evaluate the impact of IL cation on the separations, and on the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation, [C4mim]+, combined with a variety of anions, to analyze their influence on the liquid-liquid phase diagrams and L-tryptophan extraction ability.\nFigures 9.2 to 9.4 present the experimental phase diagrams at 298 K, and atmospheric pressure, for each PEG 600 + Na2SO4 + H2O + 5 wt% IL system (cf. Supporting Information with experimental weight fraction data, Table S9.1 to S9.6). It should be pointed out that the IL concentration was kept constant in all phase diagrams. The binodal curves are reported in molality units for an enhanced understanding on the impact of distinct ILs in the formation of ABS. Figure 9.2 shows the influence of the IL cation alkyl chain length, as well as the number of alkyl substitutions at the cation, in the binodal curves using different ILs, namely [im]Cl, [C1im]Cl, [C2mim]Cl, [C4mim]Cl and [C4C1mim]Cl. Figure 9.3 describes the effect of the presence of diverse functional groups at the IL cation through the binodal curves, with results for [OHC2mim]Cl, [amim]Cl and [C7H7mim]Cl. Finally, Figure 9.4 evaluates the influence of the IL anion nature in the phase diagrams, where results for [C4mim]Cl, [C4mim][CH3CO2], [C4mim][MeSO4] and [C4mim][HSO4] are depicted. In all figures the binodal curve for the control system without IL is further represented for comparison issues.\nFigure 9.2 Phase diagrams for the imidazolium-based quaternary systems composed of PEG 600 + Na2SO4 + H2O + 5 wt% IL at 298 K: ( ) no IL; (\u2022) [im]Cl ; (o) [C1im]Cl; (\u25a0) [C2mim]Cl; (A) [C4mim]Cl; (\u25b2) [C4C1mim][Cl].\nFigure 9.3 Phase diagrams for the imidazolium-based quaternary systems composed of PEG 600 + Na2SO4 + H2O + 5 wt% IL at 298 K: ( ) no IL; (A) [C4mim]Cl; (\u25a0) [OHC2mim]Cl ; (o) [amim]Cl; (\u2022) [C7H7mim]Cl.\nIt is known that an increase of the ILs hydrophobic nature leads to a lower affinity for water11-13, and consequently, to an enhanced phase separation in IL-based ABS14. Figure 9.2 shows how an increase in the cation alkyl chain length from [C2mim]Cl to [C4mim]Cl, and the presence of more alkyl substitutions at the cation, reduces the phases' miscibility. In contrast, in Figure 9.3 it is shown that the introduction of a terminal hydroxyl group or a double bond at the alkyl chain confers a polar character to\nthe IL, reducing the degree of phase separation. The effect of the IL on the binodal curves reported in Figures 9.2 and 9.3 thus follows a trend imposed by the IL hydrophobicity. The increase in the cation chain length and number of alkyl substitutions leads to a larger immiscibility, although only ILs larger than [C4mim]Cl present two-phase regions larger than that observed for the ABS with no IL.\nFigure 9.4 Phase diagrams for the imidazolium-based quaternary systems composed of PEG 600 + Na2SO4 + H2O + 5 wt% IL at 298 K: (\u2014) no IL; (\u25a0) [C4mim]Cl; (\u2022) [C4mim][CH3CO2]; (o) [C4mim][MeSO4]; (A) [C4mim][HSO4].\nThe results for the [C4mim]-based ILs, sketched in Figure 9.4, show the impact of the IL anion on the ABS formation. Only the IL [C4mim][HSO4] increases the phases' miscibility when compared to the system with no IL. All the other ILs induced a larger phase separation. The trend of the anion increasing immiscibility between the two phases is identical to that previously reported by Ventura et al.10 for IL-based ABS formation. There is a decrease on the ABS formation ability with the increase of the IL anion affinity for water, following the trend of the anion hydrogen bond acidity10. As observed for the IL cations, the hydrophobicity of the IL anion also controls the ABS formation ability.\nThe experimental binodal curves were correlated using the empirical relationship described by equation 9.111. The fitted parameters, and respective standard deviations, are summarized in Table 9.1. The experimental tie-lines (TLs) measured for each system along with the respective tie-line lengths (TLLs) are reported in Table 9.2.

For a better understanding of their impact on the phase separation and on the extraction ability of the ABS, the ILs distribution between the two aqueous phases was also evaluated. The partition coefficient of each IL, Kl, is defined as the ratio of the IL concentration in the PEG 600 and that in the Na2SO4-rich phase, as described by equation 9.7:\nKl\n,IL, PEG600\n_ILJNa2SO4\nEquation 9.7\nwhere [IL]PEG600 and [IL]Na2SO4 are the concentrations of IL in the polymer and in the inorganic salt aqueous phases, respectively.\nThe partition coefficients of each IL at 298.15 K are reported in Table 9.3. In addition, the mass fraction compositions of each component at which the partition coefficients were determined are also presented in Table 9.3. With the exception of [im]Cl, all ILs present partition coefficients larger than 1, indicating thus that ILs will partition preferentially for the PEG-rich phase. Certainly, [im]Cl is the strongest salting-out inducing IL evaluated, and thus preferentially partitions for the inorganic-salt-rich phase, while the intensity on the partitioning of the IL is proportional to the IL salting\nin/-out ability. Salting-out inducing ions (high charge density ions) have a greater tendency to form hydration complexes when compared to salting-in inducing ions (low charge density ions). Therefore, the ions' aptitude to form hydration complexes, and thus affinity for aqueous environments, will define the phase for which the IL ions mainly migrate15. This IL migration for a particular phase will naturally change the chemical and physical properties of such phase, and as will be shown below, such IL partitioning is responsible for the enhanced extraction ability of L-tryptophan observed in several ABS. Although outside the scope of this work it is interesting to notice that these results suggest the possibility of using PEG-based ABS to remove hydrophilic ILs from aqueous solutions, providing an interesting approach to the treatment of aqueous effluents contaminated with ILs.\nTable 9.3 Partition coefficients of each IL (Ail) and mass fraction compositions of the quaternary systems at 298.15 K\nQuaternary System\tMass Fraction Composition / (wt%)\t\t\tKil\n\tPEG 600\tNa2SO4\tIL\t\n[im]Cl\t39.96\t5.00\t5.08\t0.48\n[C1mim]Cl\t40.12\t5.00\t5.00\t2.23\n[C2mim]Cl\t39.98\t5.01\t5.03\t4.80\n[C4mim]Cl\t40.02\t5.00\t5.01\t7.04\n[C7H7mim]Cl\t39.94\t5.06\t5.00\t15.02\n[C4C1mim]Cl\t42.98\t4.76\t4.81\t13.80\n[amim]Cl\t39.98\t5.04\t4.99\t2.91\n[OHC2mim]Cl\t39.97\t5.02\t5.01\t2.21\n[C4mim][HSO4]\t39.99\t5.04\t5.06\t6.64\n[C4mim][CH3CO2]\t39.98\t5.08\t5.06\t7.34\n[C4mim] [MeSO4]\t39.98\t5.01\t5.00\t8.74\nA comparison between the ILs' partition coefficients reported in Table 9.3 and the binodal curves sketched in Figures 9.2 to 9.4 indicate that the addition of 5 wt% of IL to ABS enlarges the biphasic region of the PEG 600 + Na2SO4 + H2O system when the IL displays a KIL > 7.0, while an opposite result is obtained when KIL &lt;7.0.\n9.4.3.\tPartitioning of L-tryptophan in the ABS\nTryptophan (C11H12N2O2) is an essential amino acid that has to be supplied through the feed, since its synthesis cannot be achieved by animals. The body uses tryptophan to produce niacin and serotonin16. Its chemical structure is formed by an indole group that confers the hydrophobic characteristics to the amino acid. Even so, L-tryptophan was used in this work as a model biomolecule and as a proof of principle to the proposed technique. In this context, these novel systems can be further explored through their selective extraction capability with a wide range of biomolecules of interest.\nThe partition coefficient of L-tryptophan, KTrp, is here defined as the ratio of the concentration of L-tryptophan in the polymer and salt-rich phases and as described by equation 9.8:\nKTp\n\u25a0TrP.PEG 600\nTrpjN^SO4\nEquation 9.8\nwhere [Trp]PEG 600 and [Trp]Na2SO4 are the concentration of L-tryptophan in the PEG 600 and Na2SO4 aqueous-rich phases, respectively.\nThe partition coefficients of biomolecules in ABS are dependent on hydrophobic type interactions, electrostatic forces, molecular size, solubility, and affinity for both phases, and their magnitudes further depend on the two-phase compositions and on the nature of the biomolecules17-19. The partition coefficients of L-tryptophan (KTrp) at 298.15 K in the studied ABS, and respective systems composition, are reported in Table 9.4. The reproducibility of the measurements was evaluated with the PEG 600 + Na2SO4 + water system without IL addition, and the average uncertainty associated to the L-tryptophan partition coefficients is within \u00b1 5%. The KTrp dependence on the IL cation and anion, at 298.15 K, is displayed in Figures 9.6 and 9.7. For all cases, KTrp is larger than 1.0, denoting the amino acid\u2019s preferential partitioning for the PEG-rich phase (hydrophobic phase). Typical solute-solvent interactions are likely to involve van der Waals forces, electrostatic interactions, hydrogen-bonding and %\u2022\u2022\u2022% stacking. The presence of the IL enhances this type of interactions allowing the manipulation of the characteristics and the extraction ability by the polymer-rich phase. Moreover, the protons of the imidazolium ring can act as proton donors while the counterions are typically proton accepting anions.\nTable 9.4 Partition coefficients of L-tryptophan (XTrp) and mass fraction compositions of the quaternary systems at 298.15 K\nMass Fraction Composition / (wt %)\nQuaternary System--------------------------------- A'Trp\n\tPEG 600\tNa2SO4\tIL\t\n\t40.00\t5.04\t\t14.93\nno IL\t39.96\t6.04\t\t16.72\n\t39.94\t7.04\t\t20.54\n\t40.04\t5.02\t5.04\t4.82\n[im]Cl\t39.84\t6.06\t5.26\t5.28\n\t40.30\t6.97\t5.04\t7.27\n\t40.01\t5.01\t5.04\t4.69\n[C1im]Cl\t40.08\t6.01\t5.00\t5.55\n\t39.96\t7.04\t5.07\t6.01\n\t39.97\t5.10\t5.01\t7.63\n[C2mim]Cl\t39.95\t6.04\t5.29\t8.69\n\t40.09\t7.01\t5.04\t9.11\n\t40.15\t5.01\t4.98\t21.84\n[C4mim]Cl\t40.18\t6.00\t5.05\t29.43\n\t40.01\t7.00\t5.00\t37.03\n\t39.93\t5.02\t5.14\t28.62\n[C4C1mim]Cl\t39.97\t6.04\t5.00\t31.21\n\t40.21\t6.97\t5.05\t32.11\n\t40.04\t5.07\t5.00\t4.72\n[OHC2mim]Cl\t40.15\t6.04\t5.06\t5.51\n\t40.07\t6.99\t5.20\t5.71\n\t39.93\t5.01\t5.08\t11.88\n[amim]Cl\t40.13\t5.99\t5.00\t14.85\n\t40.13\t7.00\t5.07\t13.06\n\t39.94\t5.03\t5.00\t23.46\n[C7H7mim]Cl\t40.04\t6.00\t5.03\t29.57\n\t40.03\t7.00\t5.11\t42.47\n\t39.97\t5.01\t4.96\t19.24\n[C4mim][CH2CO2]\t39.93\t6.10\t5.04\t29.83\n\t39.95\t7.03\t4.96\t34.81\n\t39.98\t5.01\t5.03\t20.76\n[C4mim] [MeSO4]\t40.08\t5.99\t5.00\t25.76\n\t40.04\t7.01\t5.00\t32.64\n\t39.99\t5.06\t5.02\t17.08\n[C4mim][HSO4]\t40.16\t5.99\t5.15\t21.28\n\t40.10\t7.13\t5.03\t36.28\nThe KTrp observed for the systems using ILs with salting-out inducing characteristics were smaller than those obtained for the ABS reference system without IL, but it showed a strong increase with the alkyl-chain size of the cation (e.g. from 4.82 with [im]Cl to 21.84 with [C4mim]Cl in the system using 40 wt% PEG 600 + 5 wt% Na2SO4 + 5 wt% IL). This trend follows the IL salting-in/-out inducing ability. While salting-out ILs such as [im]Cl, [C1im]Cl, [C2mim]Cl, [OHC2mim]Cl and [amim]Cl reduce KTrp, the\nremaining ILs increase the partitioning of the amino acid (salting-in inducing ILs). In addition, removing the most acidic hydrogen at the C2 position of the IL by increasing the number of alkyl chains substitutions, as in [C4C1mim]Cl, leads to a higher KTrp when compared to [C4mim]Cl.\nIt seems that it is mainly the IL partition to the PEG-rich phase that improves the partitioning of L-tryptophan. Indeed, it can be seen in Figure 9.6 that there is a close agreement between KTrp and KIL, meaning that it is the presence of the IL on the PEGrich phase that enhances the partitioning of the amino acid. Moreover, the presence of benzyl groups or double bonds at the IL cation also enhances the ability of the PEG-rich phase for extracting the amino acid. Remarkable are the results obtained for [C7H7mim]Cl where KTrp takes the value 23.46 for the system composed by 40 wt% PEG 600 + 5 wt% Na2SO4 + 5 wt% IL, or 42.27 for the system containing 40 wt% PEG 600 + 7 wt% Na2SO4 + 5 wt% IL. In this particular case, it appears that the additional contributions of %\u2022\u2022\u2022% interactions of a second aromatic ring are responsible for the increase in the KTrp values.\nFigure 9.6 Partition coefficients of L-tryptophan (KTrp) (light grey) and of each IL (KIL) (dark grey), and pH of both top (black squares) and bottom phases (grey circles) for the chloride-based systems composed by 40 wt% PEG 600 + 5 wt% Na2SO4 + H2O + 5wt % IL, at 298.15 K.\nThe observed influence of the IL anion follows the anion hydrophobicity10 but it is minor when compared with the influence of the IL cation. The KTrp observed for the various [C4mim]-based ILs studied are similar to those observed for [C4mim]Cl. Therefore, the IL cation plays a major role in controlling the PEG-rich phase extraction ability for L-tryptophan. This effect is identical to what was observed for IL-based ABS previously studied by us9, 10.\nFigure 9.7 Partition coefficients of L-tryptophan (KTrp) (light grey) and of each IL (KIL) (drak grey), and pH of both top (black squares) and bottom (grey circles) phases, for the [C4mim]-based systems composed by 40 wt% PEG 600 + 5wt % Na2SO4 + H2O + 5wt % IL, at 298.15 K.\n20\nPreviously, Pei et al. reported that the temperature significantly influences the extraction efficiency of proteins. Therefore, aiming at evaluating the temperature influence in the extraction of L-tryptophan four systems were selected (those containing no IL, [C4mim]Cl, [C7H7mim]Cl and [C4mim][CH3CO2]). KTrp was determined at the following temperatures: 278.15, 288.15, 298.15, 308.15 and 318.15 K. These systems allowed us to study the temperature effect upon the separation, in combination with different cations and anions. The data gathered, and accurate mass fraction compositions for each system, are displayed in Table 9.5. The associated uncertainty to the experimental measurements was determined with the 40 wt% PEG 600 + 5 wt% Na2SO4 + 5 wt% [C4mim]Cl system (3 independent equilibration samples for each temperature) and shown to be inferior to 5%. The KTrp dependence on temperature is 156\ndisplayed in Figure 9.8. The four systems, and at all temperatures, present a KTrp larger than 1.0. The results indicate that the temperature has a significant effect in the amino acid partitioning. Indeed, for the system without IL there is a maximum in KTrp at temperatures close to 298.15 K, while for the systems containing IL, this maximum is observed at 288.15 K. Both IL cation and anion contribute for the differences observed in the partition coefficients and their dependence on temperature. Since electrostatic contributions are rather independent on temperature, the main deviations in KTrp as a function of temperature should be a consequence of dispersive forces and H-bonding interactions taking place in those systems.\nTable 9.5 Partition coefficients of L-tryptophan (^Trp) and mass fraction compositions of the quaternary systems at different temperatures.\nQuaternary System\tT / K\tMass Fraction Composition / (wt %)\t\t\t\u25a0 KTrp\n\t\tPEG 600\tNaiSO4\tIL\t\n\t278.15\t40.07\t5.18\t\t4.62\n\t288.15\t39.89\t5.16\t\t10.87\nno IL\t298.15\t40.00\t5.04\t\t14.93\n\t308.15\t39.97\t5.06\t\t11.60\n\t318.15\t39.92\t5.08\t\t7.45\n\t278.15\t40.04\t5.08\t5.12\t7.24\n\t288.15\t39.91\t5.06\t5.05\t26.77\n[C4mim]Cl\t298.15\t40.15\t5.01\t4.98\t21.84\n\t308.15\t40.16\t5.03\t4.99\t16.96\n\t318.15\t40.24\t5.01\t5.03\t9.74\n\t278.15\t39.88\t5.00\t5.07\t5.33\n\t288.15\t39.95\t5.01\t5.12\t25.90\n[C7H7mim]Cl\t298.15\t39.94\t5.03\t5.00\t23.46\n\t308.15\t39.95\t5.12\t5.08\t20.41\n\t318.15\t40.25\t5.04\t5.06\t15.52\n\t278.15\t39.92\t5.02\t4.98\t4.11\n\t288.15\t39.73\t4.99\t5.28\t20.52\n[C4mim][CH3CO2]\t298.15\t39.97\t5.01\t4.96\t19.24\n\t308.15\t40.01\t5.05\t5.31\t12.76\n\t318.15\t40.03\t5.05\t5.00\t11.28\n\u25a1 no IL \u25a0 [C4mim]CI \u25a1 [C7H7mim]CI \u25a1 [C4mim][CH3CO2]\nFigure 9.8 Partition coefficients of L-tryptophan (KTrp) at different temperatures.\nFrom a thermodynamics perspective, the partitioning of L-tryptophan can be regarded as a process of mass transfer from the inorganic-salt-rich phase to the PEG-rich. The amino acid thermodynamic parameters of transfer, namely the standard molar Gibbs energy (Athe standard molar enthalpy (AtrH\u00b0), and the standard molar entropy of transfer (AtrS\u00b0), were determined through the application of the following equations21:\n]n( K ) _ AtrH0 \u201e 1\t. AtrS0\nln(\tx t+\u2014\nEquation 9.9\nAtrG0 =AtrH0 - TAtrS0\nEquation 9.10\nA\t=-RT ln( Ktp)\nEquation 9.11\nwhere KTrp is the partition coefficient of L-tryptophan between the Na2SO4-rich and the PEG-rich phases, R is the universal gas constant, and Tis the temperature. The enthalpic and entropic contributions can be directly deduced from the linear approximation of ln(KTrp) versus Tl. It should be remarked that this linear function was only applied to the partition coefficient results equal to, and above, the maximum.\nTable 9.6 Standard molar thermodynamic functions of transfer of L-tryptophan at 298.15 K\nQuaternary System\tA tr H m kJ \u2022 mol-1\tA tr Sm\tT xA tr S m\tA tr Gl\tln(KTrp)\n\t\tJ \u2022 mol'1 \u2022 K 1\tJ \u2022 mol-1\tkJ \u2022 mol-1\t\nno IL\t-27.34\t-68.94\t-20.55\t-6.79\t2.74\n[C4mim]Cl\t-24.86\t-58.26\t-17.37\t-7.49\t3.02\n[C7H7mim]Cl\t-12.73\t-16.76\t-5.00\t-7.74\t3.12\n[C4mim][CH3CO2]\t-16.25\t-31.09\t-9.27\t-6.99\t2.82\nThe plots of ln(KTrp) versus Tl exhibit linearity indicating that the molar enthalpy of transfer of L-tryptophan is temperature independent. The molar thermodynamic functions of transfer at 298.15 K, obtained by the linear least-square analysis, are summarized in Table 9.6. For all the systems studied, AtrGm is shown to be negative, which in turn reflects the spontaneous and preferential partitioning of the amino acid for the PEG-rich phase. In addition, there is an increase in the absolute values of AtrGm in the presence of IL when compared to the system with no IL. On the other hand, the AtrH*m negative values reveal that the transfer of L-tryptophan between the Na2SO4-rich phase and the PEG-rich phase is an exothermic process, either for the system without IL and those containing 5 wt% of IL. The standard molar enthalpies of transfer largely depend on the IL cation, such as [C7H7mim]+, while the effect of changing the IL anion is mainly relevant for systems containing more complex anions, such as [CH3CO2]-. Nevertheless, it is clear that the presence of [C7H7mim]Cl increases the overall molar enthalpy of transfer in the system, increasing therefore the partition coefficient of the amino acid. These results suggest - and as verified before with the experimental partition coefficient values - that the partitioning process is essentially controlled by the IL cation interactions with the solute. However, the presence of anions with a stronger proton accepting ability, such as [CH3CO2]- (compared to Cl-), leads to an increase in the molar enthalpy of transfer. Yet, this increase does not directly reflect an increase in KTrp since, on the other hand, there is an increase of AtrS^ when using such more complex anions. The inclusion of the IL strongly affects the molar entropy of the initial ternary system. In fact there is an increase in the L-tryptophan molar entropy of transfer following the rank: [C4mim]Cl &lt;[C4mim][CH3CO2] &lt;[C7H7mim]Cl.\nIn summary, the absolute results of T x AtrS\u00b0 are inferior to AtrH\u00b0 suggesting that the enthalpic changes are the main driving forces ruling the amino acid partitioning.\nThe results obtained in this work suggest that the characteristics of the polymer-rich phase can be manipulated by the introduction of a small amount of an adequate IL into the system. The characteristics of the IL cation can be used to either intensify or reduce the hydrophobic character of the PEG-rich phase, or to add to it a particular type of interaction that will allow the extraction of the most diverse molecules of interest.\nAs shown in a previous work22, the extraction of L-tryptophan is strongly affected by the pH of the medium. To rule out pH effects on the measured partition coefficients, the pH of both top and bottom phases for all the ABS studied at 298 K were measured. The pH values are presented in Figures 9.6 and 9.7 together with the partition coefficient results. The pH values observed clearly reflect the acidic or alkaline character of the IL. For instance, lower pH values are observed for [C4mim][HSO4] compared to [C4mim]Cl. In addition, no significant variations in the pH values are observed for the chloride-based series, meaning that structural and functional differences at the imidazolium cation do not alter significantly their acidic/alkaline characteristics. Although the pH value of the phases is somewhat influenced by the ILs, the pH variations are too small to affect the L-tryptophan partition. Previously22 it was shown that acidic conditions (in a pH range from 1 to 3) enhance the partition coefficient of L-tryptophan, and here it is not the most acidic or alkaline IL that induces the higher partition coefficient. Therefore, the effect of the pH of both phases in ABS on the partition coefficients can be considered negligible.\nFigure 9.9 Partition coefficients of L-tryptophan as a function of PEG 600 and Na2SO4 concentrations at 298.15 K: no IL (A); 5 wt% of [im]Cl (B); 5 wt% [Cv^mimHCl] (C).\nThe increase of Na2SO4 concentration reduces the solubility of L-tryptophan in the saltrich phase (bottom phase), resulting in a further increase in the partitioning of amino acid to the top phase (PEG-rich phase)23, 24 The effect of PEG 600 and Na2SO4 concentration on the ABS extraction ability was studied for the all the systems containing IL and for the control system without IL, and at 298.15 K. The results obtained are presented in Table 9.4. As main example of the results obtained for the PEG 600 and inorganic salt concentration influence, Figure 9.9 presents the KTrp values for the ABS with [im]Cl or [C7H7mim]Cl. Figure 9.9 shows that the increase of the\npolymer concentration or salt concentration leads to an increase in KTrp. As expected, the influence of the inorganic salt concentration leads to more pronounced differences in the KTrp values than the influence of the PEG concentration.\nTable 9.7 Partition coefficients of L-tryptophan (XTrp) and IL (KiL) dependence on the IL concentration at 298.15 K\nQuaternary System\tMass Fraction Composition / (wt%)\t\t\tKil\tKTrp\n\tPEG 600\tNaiSO4\tIL\t\t\n\t40.02\t4.99\t2.62\t1.14\t6.64\n[im]Cl\t39.96\t5.00\t5.08\t0.48\t5.54\n\t40.00\t5.02\t6.03\t0.46\t5.32\n[C7H7mim]Cl\t40.00\t5.01\t2.51\t14.21\t21.48\n\t39.94\t5.03\t5.00\t15.01\t25.92\nThe concentration of IL added to the ABS system was also studied for the ILs [C7H7mim]Cl and [im]Cl, and at 298.15 K. These were chosen because they present the most extreme opposite behaviours of KTrp. The results are reported in Table 9.7. When the [C7H7mim]Cl concentration is reduced from 5 to 2.5 wt % a decrease of only 20 % on the partition coefficient of L-tryptophan is observed. This behaviour is followed by a negligible decrease of the KIL. In contrast, when using [im]Cl, both partition coefficients decrease with the increase on the IL concentration but, while the KIL falls by one half, the effect on KTrp is still negligible.\n9.5.\tConclusions\nThe use of ILs as adjuvants for the extraction of biomolecules using polymer-based ABS is here proposed. It is shown, using L-tryptophan as a model biomolecule, that ILs can be used to finely tune the phase behaviour and extraction capability of ABS through an appropriate choice of the IL employed. The effect of both the IL cation and anion on L-tryptophan extraction was established and the results can be extrapolated to other biomolecules of interest. The results reported suggest that the use of ILs as adjuvants to modify the characteristics of the polymer-rich phase could be an interesting alternative to the usual approach of PEG functionalization.\n9.6.\tReferences\n1.\tBridges, N.J., Gutowski, K.E., and Rogers, R.D., Investigation of aqueous biphasic systems formed from solutions of chaotropic salts with kosmotropic salts (salt-salt ABS).

Distinct pairs of PEGs and ionic liquids (ILs) can induce phase separation in aqueous media when dissolved at appropriate concentrations. Phase diagrams have been determined for a large array of systems at 298, 308 and 323 K. A comparison of the binodal curves allowed the analysis of the tunable structural features of the IL (i.e., anion nature, cationic core, cationic alkyl side chain length and functionalization, and number of alkyl substituents in the cation) and the influence of the molecular weight of the PEG polymer on the ability of these solutes to induce an ABS. It was observed that contrary to typical ABS based on ILs and inorganic salts, in which the phase behavior is dominated by the formation of hydration complexes of the ions, the interactions between the PEG polymers and ionic liquids control the phase demixing in the polymer-type ABS studied here. It is shown that both the ionic liquids and PEG polymers can act as the salting-out species; that is, it is an occurrence that is dependent on the structural features of the IL. For the first time, PEG/IL ABS are reported and insights into the major interactions that govern the polymer/IL phase behavior in aqueous media are provided. The use of two different non-volatile species (i.e., ILs and PEG polymers) to form ABS allows the polarities of the phases to be tailored. Hence, the development of environmentally friendly separation processes that make use of these novel systems is directly envisaged.\nKeywords: Biphasic systems, ionic liquid, phase diagrams, polyethylene glycol, salting-in/-out.\n10.2.\tIntroduction\nAs described in the previous chapter, ABS typically formed by polymer and inorganic salt aqueous solutions have several advantages over conventional polymer-polymer ABS1. However, the hydrophilic nature of PEG limits the applicability of this technique. Derivatization of the polymer is a viable possibility to overcome this issue; still, it implies significant costs and turns their application more complex. On chapter 9, it has been shown that the use of ILs as adjuvants permits a fine tuning of the characteristics of either the salt- or the polymer-rich phases in a polymer/conventional salt ABS , allowing thus an efficient and tailored control of the partition coefficients and of the\npurification efficiencies achieved within these systems. An additional advantageous aspect is that ILs can optionally be designed to have a low corrosive character3, compared to the highly corrosive aqueous solutions of conventional inorganic salts, which largely hinders their use in industrial processes. Additionally, the undesirable handling of solids in a process plant may be reduced with the replacement of the traditional inorganic salt by an IL.\nSalt additives are known to strongly influence the solute partitioning in two-polymer ABS4. The salting-out ability of the salt-rich phase and the exclusion limit of the polymer-rich phase are the two main factors which determine the partition of biological macromolecules in polymer/salt ABS5. Previous studies have also shown that the addition of a neutral salt, such as NaCl, can strongly affect the extraction performance parameters6-10. The relative hydrophobicity of the coexisting phases of several polymer-salt ABS with the addition of NaCl or KCl was measured by the free energy of transfer of a methylene group (AG(CH2))11. The results showed that there is a linear relationship between (AG(CH2)) and the tie-line length (TLL) ad it was established a straight correlation between the relative hydrophobicity of the phases and the ionic strength of the salt additive11.\nTo date, the use of ILs in ABS has been mainly confined to salt/salt ABS, where one of the two salts is an IL. Nevertheless, the possibility of using ILs in ABS of the type polymer/salt has remained largely unexplored. The idea of a polymer-IL-based ABS was present in some examples from the patent literature in the mid-2000s , , which, however, did not include experimental support for the related claims. Approximately at the same time, salting-in and salting-out effects of ILs over polyethylene glycol (PEG) aqueous media were reported, tacitly anticipating that a proper selection of the polymer and the IL could give rise to a polymer/IL ABS14, 15. Recently, polymer/IL ABS were reported with a series of hydrophobic polypropylene glycol (PPG) polymers16. Since PPG is a thermo-sensitive polymer, these novels ABS were proposed to have applications in the recycling and/or enrichment of hydrophilic ILs from aqueous media16. In spite of these preliminary efforts, no reports were found in the open literature regarding ABS composed of PEGs (less hydrophobic polymers) and hydrophilic ILs (highly polar fluids) that will allow the tailoring of the co-existing phases' polarities. Moreover, it should be remarked that the addition of PEGs to\naqueous solutions of ILs could be also advantageous in the recuperation/recycling of ILs from the most distinct approaches processed in aqueous media.\nHerein, it is reported, for the first time, the formation of PEG/IL ABS. Novel insights into the influence of both the structural features of the polymer and of the IL on the aqueous phase diagrams are also provided. These gathered results allowed to infer on the main driving forces that control the liquid-liquid demixing in PEG-IL-water systems. PEG has been selected because it is non-toxic, inexpensive, biodegradable, and has been widely used in ABS formulations with inorganic salts ,\t. Moreover, the\nmolecular weight of PEG can be easily varied over a considerable range, thus enabling a certain tuning of its characteristics and of the phase diagrams of the ABS formed. In regard to the IL, a set of hydrophilic (or moderately hydrophobic) ILs was selected, thus allowing a deep examination of the effect of several structural features related to the cationic or anionic nature and the length, number, or functionalization of the cationic alkyl side chains, on the formation and characteristics of the ABS. Phase diagrams were determined at 298, 308 and 323 K and atmospheric pressure.\n10.3.\tExperimental Section\nPEG polymers of average molecular weights 1000, 2000, 3400 and 4000 g.mol-1 (abbreviated as PEG 1000, PEG 2000, PEG 3400 and PEG 4000, respectively) were supplied by Fluka, and used as received.\nThe ILs studied were: imidazolium chloride ([im]Cl), 1-methylimidazolium chloride ([mim]Cl), 1,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride\t([C1mim]Cl),\t1-ethyl-3-\nmethylimidazolium chloride ([C2mim]Cl), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4mim]Cl), 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C6mim]Cl), 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium chloride ([C8mim]Cl), 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([amim]Cl), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([HOC2mim]Cl), 1-butyl-3-methylpyridinium chloride ([C4mpy]Cl), 1-butyl-1-methylpiperidinium chloride ([C4mpip]Cl),\t1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium chloride\t([C4mpyr]Cl),\ntetrabutylphosphonium chloride ([P4444]Cl), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C4mim]Br), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C2mim][CH3CO2]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([C4mim][CH3CO2]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate ([C2mim][CH3SO3]), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate\n([C4mim][CH3SO3]),\t1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate\n([C4mim][CF3SO3]), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogensulfate ([C2mim][HSO4]), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate ([C2mim][(CH3)2PO4]). Their chemical structures are shown in Figure 10.1. All ILs were purchased from Iolitec, with the exception of [P4444]Cl, which was kindly supplied by Cytec Industries, Inc. All IL samples were dried under moderate temperature (343 K) and high vacuum conditions (&lt;0.1 mbar), for a minimum of 48 h. The purity of the ILs was additionally checked by 1H, 19F (whenever necessary), and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and found to be > 99 wt%, except for [P4444]Cl, which was > 97 wt%.\nThe water content of all ILs and all polymers was measured by Karl-Fischer titrations, and each value was individually taken into account for the calculation of the global compositions of the PEG + IL + H2O mixtures prepared. In general, the water content in all IL samples after the drying procedure was found to be &lt;100 ppm, while the water content in the polymers was &lt;10000 ppm. Ultrapure water, doubly distilled, and passed through a reverse osmosis system, and further treated with Milli-Q plus water purification apparatus, was used.\nThe binodal curves in the phase diagrams were determined by means of the turbidometric titration method19 at atmospheric pressure and at the constant temperature of 298.2 \u00b1 0.5 K. Moreover, additional phase diagrams at 308.2 K and 323.2 K were determined for selected systems within \u00b1 0.5 K using a double jacketed cell coupled to a Julabo circulator (model F25-HD). Different ternary mixtures (ca. 1 g) of known total composition, located in the biphasic region, were prepared inside closed glass tubes. Upon dilution with minimal drop-wise additions of water, the test tubes were stirred for at least 12 h and allowed to settle for 24 h, which was found to be the common minimum time to reach the equilibrium in the different samples. These periods were found particularly important due to the high viscosity of higher-molecular-weight PEG polymers that could provide erroneous results if not enough time for dissolution and phase separation was allowed. This process was repeatedly carried out until a limpid and monophasic solution was obtained. The additions were controlled gravimetrically, with an uncertainty of \u00b1 10-4 g. The total amount of water added was determined, and the final mass fraction of each component was calculated.\n10.4.\tResults and Discussion\nPhase diagrams for the PEG/IL ABS were determined at 298, 308 and 323 K19, and the corresponding binodal curves were successfully correlated by means of Equation 10.1:\nY = A \u25a0 exp{b \u25a0 x0-5 - C \u25a0 X3)\tEquation 10.1\nwhere A, B and C are the correlation constants, and X and Y are the concentrations (in molality units) of ionic liquid and PEG, respectively (the fitted parameters are reported in Supporting Information, Table S10.1).\nSeveral ILs were investigated in order to access the influence of the anionic nature, cationic core, length and functionalization of the cationic alkyl side chain, and the number of alkyl substituents on the phase diagrams behaviour. The ionic structures of these ILs are shown in Figure 10.1. A list, including the definition of their acronyms, is provided in the Experimental Section.\nFigure 10.1 Chemical structures of the studied ILs: a) [im]Cl; b) [mim]Cl; c) [Cnmim]Cl (where n stands for the number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain (R); n = 1, 2, 4, 6, or 8); d) [amim]Cl; e) [HOC2mim]Cl; f) [C4mpy]Cl; g) [C4mpip]Cl; h) [C4mpyr]Cl; i) [P4444]Cl; j) [C4mim][CF3SO3]; k)\n[Cnmim][CH3CO2] (n = 2 or 4); l) [Cnmim][CH3SO3] (n = 2 or 4); m) [C4mim]Br; n) [C2mim][HSO4]; o)\n[C2mim][(CH3)2PO4].\nPEG 1000, PEG 2000, PEG 3400 and PEG 4000 were used to investigate the influence of the polymer in the ABS.\nAll binodal data are shown in Figures 10.2 to 10.9 and are displayed in molality units, thus avoiding disparities in the ionic liquid-based ABS formation capability that could be a direct outcome of their distinct molecular weights (the detailed weight fraction experimental data are listed in Supporting Information, Table S10.2 to S10.9).\n10.4.1.\tEffect of the Anion of the Ionic Liquid\nIn a typical PEG/inorganic salt ABS, the anion of the salt has a crucial impact on the phase behavior relative to the influence of the cation. To analyze this effect in the PEG/IL ABS studied herein, aqueous systems formed by PEG 2000 and distinct ILs with a common cation were investigated. Specifically, two sets of ILs were used: one with the [C4mim]+ cation in common ([C4mim]Cl, [C4mim]Br, [C4mim][CH3CO2], [C4mim][CH3SO3], and [C4mim][CF3SO3]), and the other with the [C2mim]+ cation ([C2mim]Cl, [C2mim][CH3CO2], [C2mim][CH3SO3], [C2mim][HSO4], and [C2mim][(CH3)2PO4]). The corresponding experimental binodal curves at 298 K and their correlation, derived by using Equation 10.1, are shown in Figures 10.2 and 10.3.\nFigure 10.2 Experimental solubility data for PEG/IL ABS at 298 K to analyze the effect of the IL anion: PEG 2000/[C4mim][CF3SO3] (\u2022), PEG 2000/[C4mim]Br (\u2666), PEG 2000/[C4mim]Cl (o), PEG 2000/[C4mim][CH3SO3] (\u25b2), and PEG 2000/[C4mim][CH3CO2] (\u25ca). The lines correspond to the respective correlations using Equation 10.1.\nThe ability of [C4mim]-based ILs to induce PEG-based ABS, as measured by the minimum required combined concentrations, follows the trend: [C4mim][CH3CO2] ~ [C4mim][CH3SO3] > [C4mim]Cl > [C4mim]Br > [C4mim][CF3SO3]; whereas for the [C2mim]-based ILs, the trend is as follows: [C2mim][(CH3)2PO4] > [C2mim][CH3CO2] > [C2mim][CH3SO3] > [C2mim][HSO4] > [C2mim]Cl. The relative ability of an IL anion to induce the formation of a second liquid phase in PEG/IL ABS follows the opposite order to that observed for K3PO4/IL ABS previously reported20. These reverse sequences can be rationalized taking into account the different salting-out aptitude of the distinct species solvated in aqueous media. When dealing with high charge density salts with an enhanced capacity for creating ion/water hydration complexes, such as K3PO4, the ability to induce ABS increases with the decrease in the affinity of the IL for water, namely, the IL is salted-out by the inorganic ions20. On the contrary, in this study, when making mixtures of polymers and ILs, the stronger agents for promoting ABS are ILs that present an improved affinity for water and, hence, IL ions with a greater salting-out ability. This consequence comes directly from the PEG hydrophobic nature and the ease with which it is salted-out by charged species.\nRegarding the sequence of the anions of the IL, it was verified that compounds with a better ability to form ion/water complexes are more effective in promoting PEG/IL-based ABS. Indeed, the salting-out aptitude of an ion can be directly related to its Gibbs free energy of hydration (AGhyd)- Thus, the acetate anion, with AGhyd = 373 kJ-mol-1, is a stronger salting-out species, and therefore more prone to induce the liquid-liquid demixing of PEG from aqueous media than, for example, the chloride or the bromide anions (AGhyd = 347 and 321 kJ-mol- , respectively) .\nFigure 10.3 Experimental solubility data for PEG/IL ABS, at 298 K to analyze the effect of the IL anion: PEG 2000/[C2mim]Cl (o), PEG 2000/[C2mim|[HS\u00dc4] (\u2666), PEG 2000/[C2mim][CH3SO3] (A), PEG 2000/[C2mim][CH3CO2] (\u25ca), and PEG 2000/[C2mim][(CH3)2PO4] (A). The lines correspond to the respective correlations using Equation 10.1.\nInterestingly, the [CF3S\u00dc3]-based IL, one of the ILs that is better at inducing the formation of the K3PO4/IL ABS , is the weakest species for salting-out the polymer when dealing with PEG-based ABS. Besides the IL/water and PEG/water interactions that govern the phase behavior in the systems presented above, we must be aware of the PEG/IL interactions that could additionally control the phase diagrams. In general, the larger the immiscibility between the IL and PEG polymer, the greater is the ability of the ionic fluid to induce the polymer separation from aqueous media. This trend correlates well with previously reported binary phase diagrams between poly(ethyl glycidyl ether) and several imidazolium-based ILs . Watanabe and co-workers demonstrated that the solubility behavior is largely dependent on the anionic nature of the IL. Fluorinated anions and/or anions with lower hydrogen-bond basicity are more miscible with the polymers investigated than anions with a higher aptitude to create ion/water complexes, such as acetate . As a consequence of this lower affinity between the acetate anion and polymers, the acetate-based IL is more efficient for the separation of the PEG aqueous phase than, for example, the [CF3S\u00dc3]-based (as experimentally\nobserved in this study). Usually, strongly basic anions tightly interact with imidazolium cations and interrupt the hydrogen-bonding interactions between the PEG and the aromatic cation of the IL, thereby lowering their miscibility.\n10.4.2.\tEffect of the Cationic Core of the Ionic Liquid\nSeveral PEG/IL ABS, chosen to evaluate the effect of different classes of IL cation in ABS formation, were studied. PEG 2000 was used as the common phase-forming polymer, and five different chloride-based ILs were investigated: [C4mim]Cl, [C4mpy]Cl, [C4mpyr]Cl, [C4mpip]Cl, and [P4444]Cl. The respective phase diagrams and the correlation of the experimental data derived by using Equation 10.1, are depicted in Figure 10.4.\nFigure 10.4 Experimental solubility data for PEG/IL ABS at 298 K to analyze the effect of the IL cation core: PEG 2000/[C4mim]Cl (\u2022), PEG 2000/[C4mpy]Cl (A), PEG 2000/[C4mpyr]Cl (\u2666), PEG 2000/[C4mpip]Cl (o), and PEG 2000/[P4444]Cl (\u25b2). The lines correspond to the respective correlations using Equation 10.1.\nThe experimental results show that the ability of ILs to induce PEG-based ABS follows the trend: [P4444]Cl > [C4mpip]Cl ~ [C4mpyr]Cl > [C4mpy]Cl ~ [C4mim]Cl. This ability correlates well with the relative hydrophobic character of the IL, with the most hydrophobic species showing cloud points at lower concentrations of IL (for a given\nconcentration of PEG). The higher the affinity for water and/or hydrophilic nature of the IL, the less effective such IL is in promoting the PEG phase separation. As previously reported , imidazolium and pyridinium cations present stronger interactions with water (as a result of their aromatic character), which results in binodal curves that are more shifted to the top/right in the phase diagram. The quaternary phosphonium-based IL (with four alkyl chains) was found to be the strongest promoter of the formation of PEG/IL ABS amongst the ILs studied as a result of the lower affinity of this compound for aqueous phases. The phosphonium IL/water miscibility essentially derives from the hydrogen-bonding interactions of water with the chloride anion. This is in stark contradiction to the trend obtained for the anions discussed above, but the cationic pattern is in good agreement with previous reports in which ABS of imidazolium-, phosphonium- and ammonium-based ILs, in the presence of common inorganic salts, were investigated ,\t. This behavior occurs because the ABS formation for these\nsystems is being driven by a different phenomenon from that discussed above for the effect of the anion of the IL. Here, the ABS formation is, as for the salt/IL ABS , , a direct result of the PEG salting-out aptitude over the moderate hydrophobic ILs considered. PEG is preferentially hydrated, and thus, tends to salt-out the ILs.\nAs for the anion-effect discussed above, the interactions that occur between the PEG polymer and ILs may also have an impact upon their phase separation. PEG is a polyether and, thus, hydrogen-bonding interactions are expected to occur with the aromatic pyridinium and imidazolium cations. The presence of n electrons in these ILs corresponds to stronger interactions with PEG. Hence, this reason could be the major factor for the lower ability of these ILs to promote the PEG-based ABS, that is, the enhanced affinity between two compounds would require a higher quantity of both solutes for liquid-liquid demixing. Reports of results on the phase behaviour of binary systems composed of polyether compounds and ILs22 corroborate the ability of the cation core to promote the PEG/aqueous phase separation observed here. Polyether compounds are more soluble in ILs containing aromatic cations and immiscible in phosphonium- and ammonium-based counterparts, thus confirming that the intermolecular hydrogen-bonds between polymers and the acidic hydrogen atoms in the IL cation are crucial features for increasing their mutual miscibility . Hence, IL/PEG-based ABS are more readily formed when two poorly soluble species are present.\n10.4.3.\tEffect of the Alkyl Chain Length, Number of Alkyl Groups, and Functionalization at the Alkyl Substituent in the Cation of the Ionic Liquid\nThe family of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ILs was selected to study the effect of the length of the cationic alkyl substituent (which is one of the major structural features that allows the hydrophobicity of the IL to be tailored) on the PEG/IL/water phase diagrams. Moreover, imidazolium-based ILs with no alkyl chains and only one alkyl group were additionally studied. Specifically, six ILs were investigated: [im]Cl, [mim]Cl, [C2mim]Cl, [C4mim]Cl, [C6mim]Cl, and [C8mim]Cl. Again, PEG 2000 was used as the common polymer in all experiments. Figure 10.5 illustrates the experimental and correlated binodal curves for the various imidazolium chloride systems.\n0.8\n0.0\t2.0\t4.0\t6.0\t8.0\n[ILl/imoLkg1)\nFigure 10.5 Experimental solubility data for PEG/IL ABS, at 298 K to analyze the effect of the length and number of the alkyl substituents in the ionic liquid cation: PEG 2000/[im]Cl (\u2022), PEG 2000/[mim]Cl (A), PEG 2000/[Cjmim]Cl (*), PEG 2000/[C2mim]Cl (\u2666), PEG 2000/[C4mim]Cl (o), PEG 2000/[C6mim]Cl (\u25b2), and PEG 2000/[C8mim]Cl (\u25ca). The lines correspond to the respective correlations using Equation 10.1.\nThe aptitude of the ILs to induce PEG-based ABS decreases on the following order: [C2mim]Cl ~ [C8mim]Cl > [C4mim]Cl ~ [C6mim]Cl ~ [C1mim]Cl > [mim]Cl > [im]Cl. It is easy to understand the lower ability of the monosubstituted, unsubstituted, and the 1,3-dimethyl-based imidazolium ILs to promote a biphasic system, given their higher\nhydrophilicity (high charge density ILs that resemble inorganic salts) according to the discussion presented above for the cation core. However, for the other bisubstituted imidazolium-based ILs, more complex phenomena take place, and the trends in the phase behavior need to be carefully examined.\nLonger alkyl chains enhance the hydrophobic character of the IL and, therefore, decrease their affinity for water while increasing the ABS promoting ability, which was previously observed with ABS of the type K3PO4/IL26. In PEG-based ABS, however, the opposite trend is observed for 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ILs with hexyl or shorter alkyl chains (although the differences are small). This pattern is a direct consequence of the IL that acts, in this case, as the salting-out species.\nInstead of the interactions of the solutes with water, the interactions between the PEG polymer and ILs control the phase behavior. As previously reported27, 28, an increase in the alkyl side chain of the cation enhances the solubility between imidazolium-based ILs and PEG polymer. The stronger the cation/anion interaction, the lower the ability of the imidazolium ring hydrogen atoms to hydrogen-bond with PEG polymer29. This trend is in close agreement with the data gathered with [Cnmim]Cl (with n = 2, 4 and 6). The longer the alkyl side chain of the imidazolium cation, the higher the miscibility/affinity with PEG, thus leading to systems that require more IL to undergo liquid-liquid demixing in aqueous media.\nThe odd behaviour observed with the system containing [C8mim]Cl implies that other factors besides those discussed above also take place. It should be reminded that this IL, contrary to those members of its homologous family with shorter alkyl substituents, forms micelles in aqueous solution above a critical concentration30, and more complex phenomena are involved. The fact that ILs with long alkyl side chains tend to form phase-separated self-assembled structures corresponds to a decreased ability of [C8mim]Cl to hydrogen bond with PEG polymer. Hence, species that do not show a special affinity between themselves are more easily separated in aqueous solution.\nFrom the gathered results of the effects of the IL cation core and alkyl side chain length, it seems that the formation of PEG/IL-based ABS is not just a direct consequence of the ability of the ions to form hydration complexes, as typically happens for ABS induced by inorganic salts. Instead, a complex interplay of interactions between PEG/water,\nIL/water, and PEG/IL takes place. The imidazolium-based cations may form multiple hydrogen bonds by the various ring protons with even weak hydrogen-bond acceptors. Competition for the protons of the imidazolium cation among the anions and PEG molecules is consequently expected. The addition of hydrogen-bond acceptors (e.g., PEG polymers) to an IL system can bring about significant changes in the magnitude . From the results reported herein, it can be concluded that the hydrogen-bonding interactions that occur in IL/PEG pairs of solutes are also driving forces in the formation of the respective ABS.\nFigure 10.6 shows the effect of the functionalization of the alkyl substituents in the cation, in particular, the influence of the presence of a double bond or a hydroxyl group in the alkyl side chain of the imidazolium cation. The binodal curves for the systems with [amim]Cl and [HOC2mim]Cl relative to those with [C4mim]Cl and [C2mim]Cl, with PEG 2000 as the common polymer.\nFigure 10.6 Experimental solubility data for PEG/IL ABS at 298 K to analyze the effect of the functionalization of the alkyl substituent in the ionic liquid cation: PEG 2000/[amim]Cl (\u2022), PEG 2000/[HOC2mim]Cl (\u25ca), PEG 2000/[C2mim]Cl (\u2666), and PEG 2000/[C4mim]Cl (o). The lines correspond to the respective correlations using Equation 10.1.\nThe ability of the ILs to promote ABS follows the order: [HOC2mim]Cl] > [C2mim]Cl ~ [amim]Cl > [C4mim]Cl. The presence of the hydroxyl group in [HOC2mim]Cl shifts\nthe binodal curve to the left, compared to that of [C2mim]Cl, which means a higher aptitude of the IL to promote the ABS. The presence of the double bond in [amim]Cl also enhances the ABS formation ability, as observed by the comparison with the systems containing [C2mim]Cl and [C4mim]Cl. It should be reminded that the [amim]+ cation is the equivalent to the [C3mim]+ cation with an additional double bond. As observed before, the trend on the ILs ability to form ABS is the opposite of what was observed in K3PO4/IL ABS26. These differences can be explained based on the increased ability of the functionalized IL ions to form hydration complexes, and hence to act as stronger salting-out species.\nRegarding the effect of all the structural features related to cation of the IL, a general conclusion can be postulated: for PEG-based ABS containing the chloride-based ILs (an anion that is in the middle rank of the Hofmeister series32, 33), the polymer tends to act as the privileged salting-out agent. Hence, hydrophobic ILs are more readily salted-out from the aqueous media and preferentially form ABS. However, if the increase in the hydrophobicity of the IL corresponds to a higher affinity for the PEG itself, the opposite behavior is observed.\n10.4.4.\tEffect of the Molecular Weight of PEG\nThe tunable character of the phase behavior of PEG/IL ABS is not exclusively derived from the manipulation of the IL structure. PEG also offers some degree of design by varying the length of its polymeric chains, that is, the average molecular weight. This effect was analyzed by studying ABS formed by the co-dissolution of a given IL (i.e., [C4mim]Cl) and PEG polymers of different molecular weights. Figure 10.7 depicts the binodal curves for several PEG/[C4mim]Cl ABS in which the average molecular weight of the PEG was varied from 1000 to 4000 g-mol-1.\nFigure 10.7 Experimental solubility data for PEG/IL ABS at 298 K to analyze the effect of the molecular weight of the PEG: PEG 1000/[C4mim]Cl (\u25a1), PEG 2000/[C4mim]Cl (A), PEG 3400/[C4mim]Cl (\u25ca), and PEG 4000/[C4mim]Cl (\u25a0). The lines correspond to the respective correlations using Equation 10.1.\nThe influence of the size of the length of the PEG chains on the phase diagrams is notorious, with the PEG ability to induce IL-based ABS that decrease in the following order: PEG 4000 > PEG 3400 > PEG 2000 > PEG 1000. An analogous trend has been observed in conventional polymer/salt ABS34-36. Hydrophobicity increases with the increase of the molecular weight of the PEG polymer, thus facilitating the formation of the ABS. Higher-molecular-weight PEG polymers present a lower affinity for water and are preferentially salted-out by the IL.\nIn the same line of the discussion previously presented, these trends also agree with the affinity/miscibility patterns observed in PEG/IL binary systems . Rodr\u00edguez et al. demonstrated that an increase in the molecular weight of the polymer leads to larger immiscibility gaps with chloride-based ILs. Hence, higher-molecular-weight PEGs are less soluble in ILs and are more easily separated from aqueous media.\n10.4.5.\tEffect of the Temperature\nTo gather information on the effect of temperature on the phase behaviour, additional PEG/IL/water phase diagrams were also determined at 308 and 323 K for two selected\nsystems, namely PEG 2000/[C2mim]Cl and PEG 2000/[C2mim][CH3CO2]. The results obtained are presented in Figures 10.8 and 10.9.\nFigure 10.8 Experimental solubility data for PEG 2000/[C2mim]Cl ABS, at 298 K (o), 308 K (\u2666), and 323 K (\u25b2). The lines correspond to the respective correlations using Equation 10.1.\nThe binodal curves show that an increase in temperature decreases the immiscibility region. The pattern observed is in close agreement with that observed in ABS composed of ILs and inorganic salts or constituted by ILs and carbohydrates . Yet, an increase in temperature leads to larger immiscibility regimes in typical PEG/inorganic salt systems, whereas the opposite pattern is verified in polymer-polymer ABS39, 40. Therefore, the dependence on temperature of the phase diagrams behavior for polymer/IL systems resembles that of polymer/polymer systems as a result of the lower charge density of the ILs relative to inorganic salts (and therefore their lower salting-out aptitude). The trends obtained here are, however, a reflection of the hydrophilic nature of the ILs investigated and their capacity to create water/ion complexes. As a result, the pattern obtained in these ternary systems are a consequence of the typical behavior from the upper critical solution temperature behavior observed in binary mixtures composed of ILs and water23. The larger differences among the binodal curves at various temperatures for the acetate-based system relative to the chloride-based ABS are a\ndirect result of the higher salting-out aptitude of the acetate anion, which is reproduced in a more pronounced dependence on temperature.\nFigure 10.9 Experimental solubility data for PEG 2000/[C2mim][CH3CO2] ABS, at 298 K (o), 308 K (\u2666), and 323 K (\u25b2). The lines correspond to the respective correlations using Equation 10.1.\nIn summary, it can be stated that PEG/IL ABS are more complex in their nature and\n30 38\ndominating interactions than the IL/inorganic salt ABS previously studied , . For the later, as shown for the K3PO4/IL-based ABS20, 26, the phase separation is dominated by the salting-out ability of the inorganic salt, with the less hydrophilic ILs the more prone to undergo ABS formation. In most examples of PEG/IL ABS, the ionic liquid acts instead as the salting-out species and, hence, they are preferentially formed by ILs with enhanced capacity to create IL/water complexes. This trend was verified to be always true when different IL anions are compared; yet, the situation was quite different when evaluating the effect of the cation core of the IL with more hydrophobic ions. The trend observed for the influence of the cation core on ABS formation does not follow the ability of the ions to form hydration complexes. On the contrary, this effect seems to be dominated by the PEG salting-out ability, with the more hydrophobic ILs more able to form ABS, except in the cases where the mutual solubilities of the PEG-IL control the system as observed with the increase of the cation alkyl chain length (verified with the [C\u201emim]Cl ILs). In general, for all the structural features evaluated, there is a close\nrelation to the IL/PEG binary phase behavior. Most inorganic salts are composed of simple and high charge-density ions; yet, when these are substituted by more complex and/or organic ions (as we do in most of the ILs investigated), the organic ion can itself influences the salting-in/-out behavior through specific interactions that are established with the polymer and not just with water. In this context, the interactions that occur between the polymer and the ionic fluid cannot be discarded, and play a crucial role in the phase behavior of PEG/IL-based ABS.\n10.5.\tConclusions\nNovel aqueous biphasic systems of the type polymer/IL have been formed by codissolving ILs and PEG polymers in appropriate concentrations in water. It was shown that the phase behaviour of the PEG/IL ABS can be tailored to a relevant extent by a judicious selection of the PEG molecular weight or of the chemical structure of the constitutive ions of the ionic fluid. A detailed understanding of the molecular-level interactions in the binary mixtures composed of ILs and PEGs allowed to show that the phase behaviour in PEG/IL ABS is not only dominated by the ability of the solutes to interact with water. Instead, it is a direct consequence of the favourable (or non-favourable) interactions that occur between the PEG polymer and the IL to a large extent.\nABS composed of PEG polymers and ILs may have great potential in the biotechnology field, in which the use of ILs to substitute the high charge-density ions of inorganic salts can constitute an important improvement towards the extraction of biomolecules. Therefore, the use of these novel systems for extraction purposes is directly envisaged.\n10.6.\tReferences\n1.\tLin, D.Q., Wu, Y.T., Mel, L.H., Zhu, Z.Q., and Yao, S.J., Modeling the protein partitioning in aqueous polymer two-phase systems: influence of polymer concentration and molecular weight.

The mechanism of formation of these ABS has been eluding the researchers working in this area. To attempt understanding the ABS formation, the complete phase diagram for this ternary system at 323.15 K and 333.15 K is reported for the first time, and identified as a type 0 phase diagram. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory calculations were used to disclose the molecular level mechanisms which control the phase behavior. They show that in the presence of water, the favorable interactions occurring between the ionic liquid anion and the -OH end groups of the polymer, responsible for their miscibility, are disrupted due to a more favorable solvation of the anion by water, inducing the observed ternary immiscibility, in a phenomenon here named as \u201cwashing-out\u201d effect, with the ABS formation.\nKeywords: Ionic liquids, polyethylene glycol, aqueous biphasic systems, phase diagrams, molecular dynamics simulations, \u201cwashing-out\u201d\n11.2.\tExperimental Section\nThe polyethylene glycol PEG polymer of average molecular weight 1500 g.mol-1 (abbreviated as PEG 1500) was supplied by Fluka and used as received. The ionic liquid (IL) used was 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4mim]Cl), purchased from Iolitec. The IL was dried under moderate temperature (343 K) and high vacuum conditions (&lt;0.1 mbar), for a minimum of 48 h, before use. Its purity was additionally checked by H and C NMR spectroscopy, and found to be > 99 wt%.\nThe ternary phase diagrams at 323.15 K and 333.15 K were determined according to the protocol established by Ruiz-Angel et al1. The composition of a ternary system, with the compounds, PEG 1500, [C4mim]Cl and H2O, can be represented in three dimensions if the sum of their proportions corresponds to 100%. A ternary phase diagram is a composition map delineating the monophasic, biphasic and multiphase composition regions of the three components. The experimental phase diagrams were determined in weight fraction compositions, and where several binary mixtures of PEG 1500 and\n[C4mim]Cl (ca. 1 g) were firstly considered. All the binary mixtures were prepared in closed glass vials and then water was drop wise added. The glass vials were properly stirred and further maintained at the temperature of equilibrium (\u00b11 K) for at least 12 h. After the equilibration period the resulting solution was visually examined, and if the phases separation was still not observed (clear solution), more water was added until the liquid-liquid demixing appeared (initially observed by turbidity in the system). At this point, the weight of water was measured and the total composition was determined. Then, more water was added to each test tube until another phase change behavior occurred (namely, a clear solution). At this second point, the weight of water added was again determined. The respective mixture compositions correspond to the saturation solubility curve. In summary, the phase diagrams were determined gravimetrically within \u00b110-7 kg.\n11.3.\tComputational Methods\nThe MD calculations were performed both for the TEG + [C4mim]Cl binary mixture and for different concentrations of the TEG + [C4mim]Cl + water ternary system. The simulations were carried out using the isothermal-isobaric NpT (T = 298.15 K and p = 1 bar) ensemble and the GROMACS 4.07 molecular dynamics package2. The equations of motion were integrated with the Verlet-Leapfrog algorithm and a time step of 2 fs was considered. The Nose-Hoover thermostat4, 5 was used to fix the temperature while the Parrinello-Rahman barostat6 was employed to fix the pressure. Starting configurations were generated in cubic boxes with lateral dimensions of 45 A, and periodic boundary conditions were applied in three dimensions. The systems were prepared by randomly placing all species in the simulation box. For the calculations of the binary systems 90 [C4mim]Cl ion pairs and 120 TEG molecules were incorporated in each box, while for the ternary solutions, (90/90/90/60/60) [C4mim]Cl ion pairs, (120/120/120/80/80) TEG molecules and (60/120/180/200/380) water molecules were included, in order to reproduce different concentrations (H2O/TEG = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 4.75), all with the same TEG/IL proportion (1.33). A 10 000 step energy minimization was performed followed by two simulations, the first one with 50 000 steps for equilibration and the final one with 10 000 000 steps (20 ns) for production. Potentials available in the literature7-9 were used for all the species considered in the simulations.\n11.4.\tIntroduction, Results and Discussion\nThe attractive and advantageous properties of both polyethylene glycols (PEGs)10, 11 and ionic liquids (ILs) - led, in the past few years, to a growing interest in the exploitation of their combinations for a diverse number of industrial and (bio)technological procedures within the framework of green chemistry16'22. In this context, very appealing and promising applications have been proposed in the domains of purification and extraction technologies, either as homogeneous solvents, as biphasic solvent systems and, very recently, as novel polymer-IL-based aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) - , -26. Nevertheless, the improvement and optimization of these applications inherently require a detailed knowledge on the phase behavior of both the IL-PEG binary mixtures and of the corresponding ternary aqueous solutions, as well as of their underlying molecular mechanisms which, due to their more complex nature, are still not completely understood. Rodr\u00edguez et al. reported, for the first time, that the liquid-liquid phase behavior of IL + PEG binary mixtures can range from the complete to almost incomplete mutual miscibility if a proper choice of the IL and of the polymer molecular weight is carried out. For instance, the binary pairs composed of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C4mim]Cl) and PEG 1000 or PEG 1500 are totally miscible within the entire range of composition and temperature evaluated whereas systems constituted by [C4mim]Cl + PEG 2000 or PEG 3400 are not23. In addition, it has been recently shown that ABS can be formed either with totally or partially miscible IL-polymer pairs . However, in spite of some novel insights derived from the reported phase behavior20, 23, the molecular-level mechanisms that control the liquid-liquid demixing in polymer/IL and polymer/IL/water systems still remain poorly understood. Unlike for the IL/salt ABS for which it is well established that the phase separation is mainly driven by a salting-out effect , and thus the two phases domain correlates well\n28\t29\nwith the salting-out ability of the salt or with the IL hydrophobicity , the mechanism driving the phase separation of PEG-IL-based ABS seems to be by far more complex . Although the major molecular-level mechanisms previously proposed were based on \u201cthe PEG hydrophobic nature and the ease with which it is salted-out by charged species\u201d , a cautious note was added mentioning that \u201cbesides the ionic liquid/water and PEG/water interactions that govern the phase behaviour (...) the PEG/ionic liquid interactions could additionally control the phase diagrams\u201d20. In fact, the mechanisms ruling the phase separation of PEG/IL systems in the presence of water, in particular for\nthose binary systems where complete miscibility is observed, still remains elusive representing a quite challenging scenario. In this context, and trying to better understand the molecular-based phenomena behind the formation of IL-PEG-based ABS, this work addresses the experimental determination of the complete [C4mim]Cl + PEG 1500 + water ternary phase diagram at two distinct temperatures (323.15 K and 333.15 K) with the concomitant use of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.\nThe experimental ternary phase diagrams at 323.15 K and 333.15 K, here depicted in Figure 11.1, are shown, for the first time, to be of type 0, characterized by an immiscibility gap in the ternary region while all the binary mixtures are fully miscible. The two-phase regime of IL-PEG-based ABS decreases with increasing temperature. This dependency is similar to that observed before in PEG-IL-based ABS20, and it is the opposite of the solubility behavior presented by PEG-inorganic-salt systems30. Moreover, additional experiments demonstrated that the ternary mixture here studied never displays a complete miscibility even at high temperatures. Instead the immiscibility region starts growing again in an hourglass type diagram.\nFigure 11.1 Experimental solubility data for the PEG 1500/[C4mim]Cl ABS at 323.15 K (red dots) and\n333.15 K (black squares).\n23\nThe complete miscibility reported by Rodr\u00edguez et al. for the system composed of [C4mim]Cl and PEG 1500 was here confirmed. Yet, the phase diagrams here measured suggest that a very small amount of water (~ 1 -3 wt% depending on the binary mixture and temperature) is enough to trigger the liquid-liquid phase separation. The phase behavior observed cannot thus be explained in terms of a salting-out phenomenon induced by the polymer through the IL or of the IL over the polymer, or attributed to an unfavorable miscibility/affinity within the PEG/IL pair.\nTo foster the understanding of the phase separation observed in aqueous media and reported in Figure 11.1, MD simulations were carried out for mixtures composed of [C4mim]Cl and tetraethylene glycol (TEG) (taken as a model of polyethylene glycol) with increasing water content. The structure and atom labeling of the studied compounds are presented in Figure 11.2.\n(i)\n(ii)\nFigure 11.2 Structure and atom labeling of (i) TEG and (ii) [C4mim]+.

In agreement with the suggestions previously provided by Rodr\u00edguez et al. , the H-bonding occurring between the Cl-and the -OH groups of TEG were identified as the main interaction controlling the mutual solubilities of the IL and the polymer in the respective binary system as shown by the strong peak observed in Figure 11.3a. Although of a much weaker intensity, as illustrated in Figures 11.3b and 11.3c, H-bonds are also established between TEG and the IL cation at the level of the hydrogen atoms of the imidazolium ring. Some hydrophobic interactions between the cation alkyl chain and the less polar moieties of the PEG are observed as well - Figure 11.3d. Nevertheless, when water is introduced into the binary system a more complex picture takes place and the intensity of the RDF peaks corresponding to the H(OH)(TEG)\u2014Cl-interactions (Figure 11.3 a) decreases very quickly along with the water concentration and essentially disappears (g(r) tends to one) when the water content is large enough. Furthermore, as suggested by the RDFs depicted in Figure 11.3b and 11.3c, the association of the hydrogen atoms of the imidazolium ring to the oxygen atoms of TEG is much less affected but also decreases somewhat with the water concentration. In contrast, no significant differences on the interactions between the non-polar moieties of the cation and the polymer are observed with the increasing water content as depicted in Figure 11.3d, indicating that, unlike those of polar nature, they are not significantly affected by the presence of water.\nThe results here reported show that the chloride anion, being an H-bond acceptor, forms H-bonds with the protons of the terminal hydroxyl groups of the polymer, while the ether oxygen atom of TEG, that is also an H-bond acceptor, establishes H-bonds with the acidic hydrogen atoms of the cation. When water molecules are introduced in the system, which can act either as a (much stronger) H-bond donor or acceptor, the H-bonds formed between water and the IL anion are more favorable and stronger than those occurring between the components of the binary non-aqueous system. Consequently, the H-bonds established between the IL anion and cation with the polymer disappear, as if washed away by the water. The weak hydrophobic interactions between the cation alkyl chain and the less polar moiety of TEG are the only remaining interactions. As a result, both the IL and the PEG become independently solvated by water and two aqueous-rich phases are formed. Given the analogy of this mechanism of 198\nphase separation with the washing process we named this mechanism of ABS formation of \u201cwashing-out\u201d.\nA support for this molecular scenario can be obtained from the DFT data reported n Tables 11.1 and 11.2 (extended Tables are supplied as Supporting Information). As it can be seen, similar interaction energies are calculated for the interactions between the chloride anion with water or with TEG (Table 11.1), which are visibly larger than the interaction energies for the water-water or water-TEG complexes. The results in Table\n11.2\tsuggest that with the increase of the water content, the interaction energy between the anion and water becomes more important than the interaction between chloride and TEG, i.e., the reaction [ClTEG]- + (H2O)n TEG + [Cl(H2O)n]- is thermodynamically favorable for a number of water molecules (n) participating in the hydration shell of the chloride >1, which results in the the washing-out effect. Thus, the driving force for the removal of the IL anion from the vicinity of the polymer is not the binding of water to the OH groups of TEG but instead, the strong(er) water-Cl- interactions which \u201cwash\u201d the anion away from the TEG, to be solvated into the water bulk. Assuming the most likely [Cl-(H2O)6]31,32 cluster, it is clear that the hydration of the anion is energetically favorable and therefore the latest is removed from the vicinity of TEG by the water molecules as soon as they are introduced into the system. Moreover, studies of the structure and dynamics of Cl-(H2O)6 cluster by MD simulations using nonpolarizable force fields predict that the chloride anion prefers a location on the interior of the cluster . It should also be highlighted that the role of the H-bonding in the solvation of cellulose by imidazolium-based ILs has been previously pointed out and the precipitation of monosaccharides, such as glucose, in an aqueous IL medium has been interpreted in terms of an analogous molecular phenomena34,35.\nTable 11.1.

Unlike what happens in IL-saltbased ABS, where the phase behavior is dominated by the salt ions ability to form hydration complexes (salting-out inducing effect), and the formation of PEG-IL-based ABS is controlled by the water solvation of the IL anion which leads to the destruction of the H-bonds established between the IL anion and the PEG-OH groups. The ABS formation in PEG/IL systems is thus different than previously anticipated11 and does not result from a salting-out effect of the polymer by the IL or of the IL over the polymer; instead, the PEG-IL-based ABS formation is a result of what is here named a \u201cwashing-out\u201d phenomenon.\n11.5.\tReferences\n1.\tRuiz-Angel, M.J., Pino, V., Carda-Broch, S., and Berthod, A., Ionic Liquids in separation techniques, Journal of Chromatography A, 2007. 1151 (1-2): p. 65-73.\n2.\tHess, B., Kutzner, C., van der Spoel, D., and Lindahl, E., GROMACS 4: Algorithms for Highly Efficient, Load-Balanced, and Scalable Molecular Simulation.

Three probe dyes were used to demonstrate that either the polymer-rich or the ionic-liquid-rich layer can serve as the most hydrophobic phase allowing the tailoring of phase polarities.\n12.2.\tMaterials and Experimental Procedure\nChloranilic Acid (CA, > 99 wt% pure) was purchased from Merck, while Indigo Carmine (IC, > 98 wt% pure) and Indigo Blue (IB, > 95 wt% pure) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. All the ILs were commercially acquired from Iolitec with purities > 98 wt %. All samples were dried for 24 h under vacuum and at a moderate temperature (323 K) before use. PEG of average molecular weight 1500 g.mol-1 (PEG 1500) was supplied by Fluka and used as received. The water used was ultrapure water, double distilled, passed by a reverse osmosis system and finally treated with a Milli-Q plus 185 purification equipment.\nThe ABS combining PEG 1500 and four different ILs, namely [C2mim]Cl, [C4mim]Cl, [C4mpyrr]Cl and [C4mpip]Cl were determined by the turbidimetric titration method. A mixture point into biphasic region, approximately 38 wt% of PEG, 52 wt% of IL and 10 wt% of water, was selected and used to evaluate the partitioning of three different dyes, Chloranilic acid (CA), Indigo Carmine (IC) and Indigo Blue (IB), respectively. In each system a small amount of each dye, ~ 0.30 mg, was added to glass tubes containing the ternary compositions with a total mass of 5 g. The ABS were then allowed to equilibrate at 323 K and pressure conditions during 3 h. After that period, the top and bottom phases were carefully separated, and the partition coefficients of each dye were evaluated. The partition coefficient is defined as the concentration of the dye in the IL-rich to that in the PEG-rich phases. The quantification of each dye in both phases was carried out by UV-Vis spectroscopy.\n12.3.\tIntroduction, Results and Discussion\nTraditional aqueous biphasic systems (ABS) consist of two immiscible aqueous-rich phases based on polymer/polymer, polymer/salt or salt/salt combinations. These systems actually constitute a greener alternative to typical solvent-extraction strategies\nwhich use volatile and hazardous solvents. ABS are constituted by a high water content (circa 60-80 % in a weight fraction basis) and are able to maintain the native conformation and biological activity of the most diverse biomolecules. Traditional polymer-based ABS have been largely employed in the separation and purification of proteins, enzymes, blood cells and antibiotics - . However, and despite their advantages, conventional polymer-based ABS exhibit a limited hydrophobic-hydrophilic range at their coexisting phases which has restricted their application due to limited extraction yields and purification factors. ABS composed of two distinct polymers display coexisting phases of similar polarities whereas polymer-salt ABS present a hydrophobic and an ionic and particularly hydrophilic layer. The limited array of different polarities in these more traditional systems has led the search of alternative strategies, such as the polymer derivatization or use of additives, aiming at improving the extraction yields of a target molecule. Nevertheless, these approaches turn the process more complex and costly8-13.\nAs alternatives to polymers, ionic liquids (ILs) were proposed as novel phase forming components of ABS14, 15. They exhibit several interesting properties, and one of the most interesting and valuable features in the field of separation approaches is the prospective to tailor their solvent ability by selection of the IL constituting ions15. ABS composed of ILs have already shown to be enhanced platforms for the extraction of the most diverse biomolecules from aqueous media16-22. Besides the ABS composed of ILs and inorganic/organic salts, it has been recently demonstrated that the IL-based ABS concept can be extend to polymer-IL combinations23-26. Most works address the use of polypropylene glycol (PPG) due to its higher ability to liquid-liquid demixing in the presence of \u201csalting-out\u201d inducing ILs ,\t. Nonetheless, the ABS formed by ILs and\npolyethylene glycol (PEG), a more hydrophilic polymer than PPG, are by far more interesting and complex23. It was observed that, despite the hydration capability of the isolated ions in aqueous media, the interactions occurring between the ionic fluid and\n23 29 30\nthe polymer play a major role on the formation of these ABS , , .\nBased on the tailoring aptitude afforded by ILs, as well as on the hydrophilic character of low molecular weight PEG, this work shows the partitioning behavior of three dyes, used as molecular probes of different hydrophobicity, aiming at demonstrating how (IL+PEG)-based ABS can expand the hydrophobic-hydrophilic range of polymer-based ABS overcoming thus one of their major limitations. For that purpose, the ternary phase 208\ndiagrams of ABS, composed of different water-miscible chloride-based ILs and PEG 1500, were initially determined at 323 K and atmospheric pressure by the turbidimetric titration method . Different ILs were employed, and the experimental binodal curves and respective correlations , are shown in Figure 12.1. The detailed experimental weight fraction data and correlation parameters are given in Supporting Information (Table S12.1).\nFigure 12.1 Experimental solubility data and correlations for IL/PEG 1500 ABS at 323 K and atmospheric pressure: (\u25a0) [C4mpip]Cl; (\u2022) [C4mpyrr]Cl; (\u2666) [C2mim]Cl; (\u25b2) [C4mim]Cl. The molecular structures of the ILs are provided as an insert.\nThe experimental results, shown in molality units (mole of solute per kg of solvent), reveal that the ability of the ILs to induce a PEG-1500-based ABS follows the trend: [C4mpip]Cl > [C4mpyrr]Cl > [C2mim]Cl ~ [C4mim]Cl. According to the results\n27 28\nreported for PPG ,\t, the higher the IL ions ability to create hydration complexes\nand/or its hydrophilic character the higher it is its salting-out aptitude. However, with PEG, and as observed before23, the ABS formation phenomenon is more complex. According to this salting-out inducing model the most hydrophobic IL investigated, [C4mpip]Cl, should be the less effective in promoting the liquid-liquid regime. Instead, this IL is the most proficient in the formation of PEG-based ABS. As detailed elsewhere , , the interactions between PEG and ILs and their disruption by water are the driving force behind the ABS formation. Due to the wide polarity range of the ILs\nand based on a preferential PEG-IL affinity it is thus conceivable the possibility of tuning the phases' polarities by the adequate selection of the IL.\nThe partitioning behaviour of three dyes of different hydrophobicity was investigated in the novel determined liquid-liquid systems in order to confirm and macroscopically ascertain on the phases' polarities. For that purpose chloranilic acid (CA, octanol-water partition coefficient - log Kow = 1.22 ), Indigo Carmine (IC, log Kow = 1.627 ) and Indigo Blue (IB, log Kow = 3.188 ) were used. After an equilibration period of 3 h at 323 K, the top and bottom phases were separated and the partition coefficient - defined as the concentration of each dye in the IL-rich to that in the PEG-rich phases, was measured. Additional experimental data, namely phases' compositions and partition coefficient values are provided in Supporting Information (Tables S12.2 and S12.3).\nThe partition coefficients obtained for CA are depicted in Figure 12.2. At a neutral pH (and charged CA) it is notorious that a wide range of partition coefficients can be obtained with the various PEG-IL ABS. Nevertheless, at these conditions, CA preferentially migrates for the IL-rich phase. This is a consequence of the negative charge of CA at this pH and its preference for the most charged layer driven by electrostatic interactions. CA has pKa values of 0.58 and 3.18 . The respective dissociation curves and the pH values of the coexisting phases of each ABS are presented in Supporting Information (Figure S12.1). In aqueous media, at different pH values, CA may exist as a cationic, zwitterionic or anionic species. Therefore, aiming at avoiding the prevalence of electrostatic interactions, further experiments were conducted at a controlled pH (between 3 and 4) to maintain CA as a neutral species. For comparison purposes and to ascertain on the potential of polymer-IL ABS to broaden the hydrophobic-hydrophilic range provided by common systems, the results obtained for typical polymer-salt and polymer-polymer ABS, namely PEG 4000 + Dextran 40000 and PEG 1500 + Na2SO4, are also depicted in Figure 12.2.\nFigure 12.2 Log of the partition coefficients (log K) of CA in several IL-based ABS at 323 K (neutral CA is violet; anionic CA is orange). The molecular structure of CA is provided as an insert.\nThe partitioning of CA as a neutral molecule is remarkably different from that observed with its charged counterpart. With the traditional systems, CA always migrates for the PEG-rich phase - the most hydrophobic layer in both examples. Now while for the [C2mim]Cl- and [C4mim]Cl-based ABS CA still preferentially migrates for the PEGrich phase an inversion on the migration pattern is observed when using the more hydrophobic ILs, such as [C4mpip]Cl and [C4mpyrr]Cl. CA presents a high Kow value which reflects its affinity for more lipophilic solvents. Thus, the partition coefficients here obtained clearly confirm an inversion on the phases' polarities within the PEG-IL-based ABS. They show that it is possible to convert the PEG into the more hydrophilic phase and thus to tailor the preferential migration of a hydrophobic molecule by varying the IL cationic structure. The visual aspect of the systems studied is depicted in Figure\n12.3.\nNa2SO4 Dextran [C2mim]Cl [C4mim]Cl [C4mpip]Cl [C4mpyrr]Cl\nPEG 1500 or 4000 (in polymer/polymer ABS)\nFigure 12.3 Visual aspect of the migration pattern of neutral CA in the studied ABS at 323 K.\nBesides the inversion on the migration pattern observed with the neutral CA the effect of the pH towards the partitioning behaviour should be additionally highlighted. In the imidazolium-based systems an overturn on the preferential partitioning of the solute arises as a consequence of the medium pH. An increase in the pH of the aqueous medium leads to a trend shift on the migration of the dye from the polymer- to the IL-rich phase. Visser et al.34 also demonstrated a reversible pH-dependent liquid-liquid partitioning of an indicator dye, thymol blue, but only with water immiscible ILs.\nTo further support the proposed concept, the partition coefficients of Indigo Blue and Indigo Carmine were also determined in similar ABS. The partition coefficient values and the macroscopic appearance of the migration tendency of the two dyes are depicted in Figures 12.4 and 12.5, respectively. The results obtained with the conventional PEG-1500-Na2SQ4 ABS are also presented for comparison purposes. The details on the partition coefficient values, pH of the coexisting phases and mixture compositions are shown in Supporting Information (Table S12.3).\nThe results illustrated in Figures 12.4 and 12.5 were determined at a pH near 7 at which IB is mainly present as a neutral molecule and IC is in a salt form - cf. Supporting Information (Figures S12.2 and S12.3) with the respective dissociation curves. While in the conventional system composed of PEG + inorganic salt the favoured partitioning of IB and IC occurs for the PEG-rich phase, as was observed with CA, the IB partitioning pattern demonstrates that it is possible to manipulate and control the dye partition by a judicious choice of the IL employed. The inversion of the phase's polarities is here again confirmed by the reversal on the dyes' preferential partitioning. The partitioning of the IC salt, as previously observed for the charged CA, is different and reveals a preferential migration for the charged IL-rich phase in all systems.\nFigure 12.4 Log of the partition coefficients (log K) of neutral IB and charged IC in several IL-based ABS at 323 K and in PEG 1500/Na2SO4 ABS. The molecular structures of IB and IC are provided as an insert.\nFigure 12.5 Visual aspect of the migration pattern of IB and IC in the studied ABS at 323 K.\nIn summary, this work shows, for the first time, that IL-PEG-based ABS exhibit a much wider hydrophilic-hydrophobic range than conventional ABS reported to date and that their phases' polarities can be tuned by the choice of an appropriate IL. These features were confirmed with the migration of three probe dyes of different hydrophobicity and making use of their charged and neutral states. The inversion on the phases' polarities was established by an observed trend shift on the dyes' preferential migration, i.e., either for the PEG- or the IL-rich phases. This ample versatility of IL-PEG-based ABS creates thus a new plethora of extraction and purification systems hitherto unknown.\n12.4.\tReferences\n1.\tAlbertsson, P.\u00c2., Partition of cell particles and macromolecules : separation and purification of biomolecules, cell organelles, membranes, and cells in aqueous polymer two-phase systems and their use in biochemical analysis and biotechnology. 3rd ed1986, New York: Wiley. 346 p.\n2.\tShanbhag, V.P. and Johansson, G., Specific extraction of human serum albumin by partition in aqueous biphasic systems containing poly(ethylene glycol) bound ligand.

The preferential partitioning of three alkaloids (caffeine, xanthine and nicotine) was addressed by means of their partition coefficients and selectivity values. Aiming at optimizing the selectivity of the studied ABS, factors such as the chemical structure of the IL (cation side alkyl chain length, number of aliphatic moieties or their functionalization, and the anion nature) and the temperature of equilibrium were experimentally addressed. In almost all examples it was observed a preferential concentration of caffeine in the polymer-rich phase whereas nicotine and xanthine preferentially migrate to the (opposite) IL-rich phase. In spite of the alkaloids chemical similarities, the studied ABS presented selectivity values of xanthine vs. caffeine as large as 19. The gathered results show that polymer-IL-based ABS allow the selective separation of similar structures by an adequate manipulation of the IL' chemical structure and temperature of equilibrium, and can be envisaged as potential platforms to be applied in countercurrent chromatography.\nKeywords: Aqueous biphasic system, ionic liquid, polyethylene glycol, alkaloid, selective partition process.\n13.2.\tIntroduction\nDue to the outstanding properties of ILs, IL-based ABS have led to enhanced performances on separation mainly because of the possibility of tailoring the polarity of both phases by a proper choice of the IL1-3. Polymer-polymer-based ABS usually display two hydrophobic phases and their polarity differences essentially depend on the amount of water in each phase. On the other hand, polymer-salt ABS present a hydrophobic phase mainly constituted by the polymer and a highly hydrophilic (and ionic) phase, typically formed by high charge-density inorganic salts4. The limited range of polarity differences between the two phases limits thus the applicability of conventional polymer-based ABS for extraction and separation purposes. However, the substitution of a high charge density inorganic salt and/or a polymer by an IL may provide a precise control of the phases' polarities since they can be adequately chosen taking into account the vast array of their ionic structures (at least 106 simple ILs can be\neasily prepared in the laboratory)5. Further advantages can be associated to the use of ILs as constituents of ABS when compared with the more conventional high-melting inorganic salts, namely their lower corrosive character6, and the possibility of controlling the salt precipitation, since ILs display lower melting temperatures and hydrophilic ILs are usually miscible with water in the complete composition range. Despite the large amount of literature devoted to ABS composed of ILs and inorganic salts , recently some works have further reported the formation of aqueous systems involving polymers and ILs6, 8-10. In those works the influence of the ILs' structure on the phase behaviour and ABS formation was addressed6, 8-10. It was shown that the phase behaviour, as well as the phases polarities, of polymer-IL-based ABS can be properly tailored by a judicious selection of the polymer or IL employed6, 8-10. In particular, a detailed understanding of the molecular-level interactions occurring in ABS composed of ILs and polyethylene glycol (PEG) was carried out by Freire et al.6. The liquid-liquid demixing ability in the IL-polymer-based ABS was explained and supported as dominated by the interactions taking place between the polymer and the ionic species and not by the hydration capability of the isolated IL ions6.\nDespite the reduced number of publications dealing with polymer-IL ABS9-11, their singular nature and properties makes them promising liquid-liquid separation systems to apply into countercurrent chromatography (CCC) when envisaging large scale applications. The CCC is an emerging low pressure chromatographic technique which can leads to the separation of a large range of molecules on the basis of different partition coefficients obtained between the two immiscible liquid phases . In fact, a significant number of works associating the CCC technique with ABS can be found in literature making use of polymer-polymer13 or polymer-salt ABS14-17 being, however, the use of IL-based ABS only limited to one literature study . The use of IL-based ABS leads to a density difference that makes the liquid-liquid system easier to retain in a CCC column . The use of a new chromatographic strategy for the quantitative determination of several alkaloids was recently reported by Wei et al.19. The authors applied an IL-based microwave-assisted extraction for a fast and safe quantitative analysis of the active components from pigeon pea leaves19.\nTaking into consideration the wide polarity range displayed by IL-based ABS, in the present work it was investigated the use of some novel PEG-IL-based ABS recently reported6 for the selective separation of similar alkaloids, namely xanthine, caffeine and\nnicotine. As recently suggested1, IL-based ABS are an enhanced strategy for concentrating alkaloids from human biological fluids in order to perform doping control analysis. Moreover, several biomass samples and pharmaceutical products present different types of alkaloids. Therefore, their isolated identification and analysis is of foremost importance.\nThe main objective of this work is to show that, by the application of different ILs as main constituents of ABS, it is possible to manipulate the affinity of different alkaloids for different phases and, consequently, to selectively separate related chemical structures. The studied ABS are composed of polyethylene glycol (with an average molecular weight of 2000 g.mol-1) and different imidazolium-based ILs, so that the effects of the cation alkyl side chain length, the number of alkyl groups at the cation or their functionalization, as well as the anion nature, could be evaluated. The effect of temperature on the selective extraction was also investigated.\n13.3.\tExperimental Section\n13.3.1.\tMaterials\nThe ILs investigated as main constituents of IL-polymer-based ABS were 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [amim]Cl (98.0 wt% pure), 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [OHC2mim]Cl (99.0 wt% pure), 1-methylimidazolium chloride, [C1im]Cl (98.0 wt% pure), 1,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride, [C1mim]Cl (99.0 wt% pure), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, [C2mim]Cl (98.0 wt% pure), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, [C2mim][CH3CO2](98.0 wt% pure), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium methanesulfonate, [C2mim][CH3SO3] (99.0 wt% pure), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogenosulfate, [C2mim][HSO4] (99.0 wt% pure) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dimethylphosphate, [C2mim][DMP] (98.0 wt% pure). All ILs were supplied by Iolitec. Their ionic structures are presented in Figure 13.1.\n[C2mim]CI\n[CifnimjCl\n[HOC2mim]CI\n[C2mim][HSO4]\n[C3mim][CH3CO2]\n[C3mim][DMP]\n,A>-\n[C2mim][CH3SO3]\nFigure 13.1 Chemical structure and respective abbreviation name of all the ILs investigated.\nBefore use all ILs were dried under constant stirring, moderate temperature (343 K) and high vacuum conditions (<0.1 mbar) for a minimum of 48 h. The purities of all ILs were additionally confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR and they are according to those given by the supplier. Polyethylene glycol, with an average molecular weight of 2000 g.mol-1 (PEG 2000) was acquired at Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.\nThe water content of all ILs and polymer was measured by Karl-Fischer titration and was taken into account in the calculation of the global compositions of the PEG 2000 + IL + H2O mixtures. In general, the water content of IL samples after the drying procedure was found to be&lt;1000 ppm, whereas the water content in the polymer was&lt;10000 ppm. Ultrapure water that was doubly distilled, passed through a reverseosmosis system, and further treated with a Milli-Q plus water purification apparatus was used.\nThe alkaloids used as partitioning solutes were xanthine (99.0 wt% pure from Sigma-Aldrich), nicotine (>97.0 wt% pure from Fluka) and caffeine (>99.5 wt% pure from Jos\u00e9 Manuel Vaz Pereira). The molecular structures of the 3 alkaloids are depicted in Figure 13.2.\nFigure 13.2 Chemical structure of the three alkaloids investigated.\n13.3.2.\tMethods\n13.3.2.1.\tPartitioning Studies and Selectivity of Alkaloids\nAll the liquid-liquid partitioning systems or ABS were prepared in graduated centrifuge tubes by weighing the appropriate amounts of PEG 2000 (~ 53 wt%), IL (~ 27 wt%) and ~ 20 wt% of an aqueous solutions containing each one of the alkaloids, namely caffeine (15.1 g.L-1, 7.78*10-2 mol.L-1), xanthine (0.01 g.L-1, 6.57*10-5 mol.L-1) and nicotine (2.0 g.L- , 1.23*10- mol.L- ). All the solutions were prepared in order to be guarantee that the alkaloids are at infinite dilution aiming at avoiding solute-solute interactions which could lead to different partitioning behaviors. The different alkaloid concentrations were selected to assure a maximum accuracy within the analytical technique employed. All the biomolecules can be considered as completely solvated in aqueous media avoiding thus specific interactions between them. The selected mixtures form two immiscible aqueous phases as confirmed by the corresponding ternary phase diagrams previously published6. All mixtures were gravimetrically prepared within \u00b1 10-4 g. After a complete dissolution of all the components in the mixture by stirring, the mixture was left to equilibrate for 12 h in an air oven and at 323, 333, 343, 353 or 363 (\u00b1 1) K, to achieve the complete partitioning of each alkaloid between the aqueous phases. The two phases were then carefully separated and the alkaloids were quantified in both the top and bottom phases by UV-spectroscopy, using a SHIMADZU UV-1700, Pharma-Spec Spectrometer, at the wavelengths of 261 nm (for nicotine), 267 nm (for xanthine) and 274 nm (for caffeine). Calibration curves for the determination of each alkaloid were previously established at the respective maximum absorption peaks. Possible interferences of the polymer or ILs through the quantification of each alkaloid were taken into account and found to be of no concern at the dilutions carried out.\nAt least three individual ABS for each IL or alkaloid were prepared being the partition coefficient results presented as an average value and being the uncertainty associated to the alkaloids\u2019 partition coefficients within \u00b1 5%.\nThe alkaloids partition coefficients (Kaik) were estimated according to Equation 13.1:\n\\alk Jzz, alk\t\\alk]pEG\nEquation 13.1\nwhere [alk]1L and [alk]PEG represent the concentration of each alkaloid in the IL- and PEG-2000-rich phases, respectively.\nIt should be remarked that the relative densities of the IL- or polymer-rich phases are not constant, i.e. the denser phase can be either the polymer- or the IL-phase, depending on the IL which constitutes the ABS - see Table S13.1 in Supporting Information with the detailed information.\nThe temperature effect in the partitioning process was also evaluated for nicotine and caffeine. The respective thermodynamic parameters of phase transfer, such as the standard molar Gibbs energy (A^G^), the standard molar enthalpy (AtrH\u00b0m), and the standard molar entropy of transfer (AtrS^) were determined according to Equations (13.2) to (13.4)20, 21,\nln( Ka&amp;)\nA S0\nAtrSm\nEquation 13.2\nAG\nAH - TAG\nAG =-RT ln( Kalk )\nEquation 13.3\nEquation 13.4\nA H\nR\n1\nx \u2014+ T\nR\nwhere Kak is the partition coefficient of the alkaloid, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J.mol-1.K-1) and T is the temperature (K).\nThe selectivity on the partition of nicotine (Snic/caf) or xanthine (Sxant/caf) in respect to caffeine was calculated according to Equations (13.5) and (13.6), respectively:\nSmc/caf\tEquation 13.5\nKcaf\nK\nS xant/ caf =Equation 13.6\nKcaf\n13.2.2.\tpH Determination\nThe pH (\u00b1 0.02) of the top and bottom phases was measured at 323 (\u00b1 1) K using an HI 9321 Microprocessor pH meter (HANNA instruments). The calibration of the pH meter was carried out with two buffers (pH values of 4.00 and 7.00). The compositions adopted at the biphasic region mixture correspond to those used in the partitioning experiments. All mixtures were gravimetrically prepared within \u00b1 10-4 g.\n13.4.\tResults and Discussion\nThe migration of a target molecule in an ABS depends on the physico-chemical properties of the two phases so that specific extractions or its selectivity can be manipulated. Several conditions can be used to control the molecules partitioning, such as the chemical composition of the system, temperature, pH, and the inclusion of adjuvants, affinity ligands or amphiphilic structures , .\nIn this work, it was first evaluated the effect of the IL which composes the IL-PEG-2000-based ABS on the partitioning of three alkaloids, namely caffeine, nicotine and xanthine at a similar composition (27 wt% of IL + 53 wt% of PEG 2000 + 20 wt% of an aqueous solution containing the alkaloid) and temperature (323 \u00b11 K). This first set of results allows the analysis of the impact of the IL on the partition coefficients of the alkaloids, as well as the nature of the solute and its partitioning pattern. Regarding the structural variations at the IL cation, the selected ILs allow the study of the effects of the alkyl side chain length, the aliphatic moiety functionalization and of the number of alkyl groups present at the imidazolium ring. For that study the chloride anion was fixed and was combined with the following cations: [C1im]+, [C1mim]+, [C2mim]+, [amim]+ and [OHC2mim]+. The logarithm of the partition coefficients (log Kalk) for the three alkaloids at 323 (\u00b1 1) K, is depicted in Figure 13.3 (the detailed partition coefficients, and respective standard deviations, and extraction efficiencies are reported in Table\nS13.2\tin Supporting Information). The gathered results indicate that all the alkaloids\npreferentially migrate for the IL-rich phase with the exception of caffeine that favorably partitions for the PEG-2000-rich phase in the ABS composed of [C2mim]Cl, [amim]Cl and [OHC2mim]Cl.\nlog\n\u25a0 Nicotine\t\u25a1 Caffeine\tCXanthine\nFigure 13.3 Logarithm of the alkaloids partition coefficients (logKaik) in the ABS composed of PEG 2000 (~53 wt%) + chloride-based ILs (~27 wt%) and at 323 K. The pH values of the top and bottom phases are also displayed.\nThe pH values of the coexisting phases of the systems shown in Figure 13.3 range between 2.8 and 6.5. Taking into account the alkaloids speciation as a function of the pH in the systems investigated (the individual speciation curves are presented in Figures\nS13.1\tto S13.3 in Supporting Information), both xanthine and caffeine are present mainly as neutral molecules, whereas nicotine is present mostly as a positively charged species.\nFrom the three alkaloids studied, nicotine is the one with the lowest affinity for water, as expressed by the higher octanol-water partition coefficient, Kow = 3.71 . However, despite this higher affinity for more hydrophobic phases and an expected preferential migration for the polymeric phase, nicotine, being present mostly as a positively charged species in all the investigated systems, preferentially partitions for the most hydrophilic and charged IL-rich phase. In addition, when comparing the trends collected\nwith the two neutral alkaloids in the systems displayed in Figure 13.3, xanthine always migrates for the IL-rich phase while caffeine shows an inversion to this pattern with more hydrophobic ILs. The Kow values of caffeine and xanthine are 0.23 and 0.74 , respectively, indicating that contrarily to nicotine, caffeine and xanthine display a higher affinity for more hydrophilic and water-rich phases. This preferential affinity of caffeine for hydrophilic phases is reflected in the inversion on its partition coefficients for the polymer-rich phase that occurs when ILs with longer aliphatic moi eties (i.e. more hydrophobic ILs) are present.\nThe effect of the IL anion on the partitioning of the three alkaloids was also investigated with the results depicted in Figure 13.4. As observed before with caffeine and the ABS composed of [C2mim]Cl, for all the systems composed of [C2mim]-based ILs, caffeine preferentially migrates for the polymer-rich phase, contrarily to what is observed with nicotine and xanthine. At the pH values of the coexisting phases of the systems considered in Figure 13.4 (1.5 &lt;pH &lt;9.2), xanthine and caffeine are present mainly as neutral species while nicotine is mostly as a positively mono-charged species - cf. speciation curves in Supporting Information (Figures S13.1 to S13.3). Therefore, as observed before, nicotine always favourably migrates for the charged IL-rich phase despite the higher affinity of its neutral form for more organic phases. Xanthine, albeit present as a neutral species, partitions in most examples for the most hydrophilic and IL-rich phase due to its inherent hydrophilic nature.\nFigure 13.4 Logarithm of the alkaloids partition coefficients (log Kalk) in the ABS composed of PEG 2000 (~53 wt%) + [C2mim]-based ILs (~27 wt%) and at 323 K. The pH values of the top and bottom phases are also displayed.\nIn summary, both xanthine and nicotine preferentially migrate for the IL-rich phase in practically all the studied ABS whereas the migration of caffeine can be tailored by the choice of the IL which constitutes a given ABS. Therefore, these results suggest that there is an inherent selectivity of the studied ABS for similar chemical structures such as alkaloids. To investigate the selective character of the IL-polymer-ABS studied, the selectivity of nicotine and xanthine in respect to caffeine for the IL-rich phase, Snic/ccf and Sxant/caf, respectively, were further calculated. The corresponding results are presented in Figure 13.5. The data shown in Figure 13.5(A) allow the evaluation of the IL structural influence towards the selectivity at a fixed temperature and mixture composition. The selectivity data indicate that the modification of the IL chemical structure has a huge influence on the selective separation of caffeine from the remaining alkaloids.\nIonic Liquid\tSelectivity Sxantcaf\t^nic/atf\n[amim]Cl\t3.04\t4.38\n[OHC2mim]Cl\t6.94\t9.90\n[CiimJCl\t0.73\t1.07\n[CitnimJCl\t0.54\t0.93\n[C;mmi]Cl\t8.19\t\n[C2mim[CH3CO:]\t19.40\t6.49 \\\n[C2mim[CH3SO3]\t2.73\t4.62\n[C2mim][HSO4]\t2.17\t5.79\n[C;mim[DMP]\t5.24\t6.37\nSelectivity\nTemperature (\u00b11) K\t$niccaf\n323\t5.43\n333\t7.00\n343\t7.34\n353\t8.45\n363\t7.94\nFigure 13.5 Selectivity parameters for: A) xanthine/caffeine (Sxan/cf) and nicotine/caffeine (Snic/caJ) pairs considering all PEG 2000-ILs-based ABS tested and B) nicotine/caffeine (Snic/caf) pair considering the PEG 2000-[C2mim]Cl-based ABS and different temperatures of extraction.\nDespite the molecular structure similarities between caffeine and xanthine, selectivity values up to 19 can be achieved with the ABS composed of [C2mim][CH3CO2]. Indeed, the selectivity values cover a wider range for the caffeine-xanthine binary mixture than for the caffeine-nicotine pair. In addition to these calculations based on the isolated partition coefficients, the experimental investigation on the partitioning behavior of a mixture of alkaloids, namely caffeine and nicotine, was also carried out. For that purpose, a system composed of [OHC2mim]Cl + PEG 2000 + an aqueous solution containing both nicotine (2.0 g.L-1) and caffeine (2.0 g.L-1) was used - one of the foremost systems leading to high selectivity values.\nThe UV-Vis spectra of the aqueous solutions of the pure compounds (caffeine and nicotine) and in each IL- or polymer-rich phase are presented in Figure 13.6. The gathered results clearly show that nicotine is preferentially present in the IL-rich phase whereas caffeine is mainly concentrated in the polymer phase. Based on these results, the respective Kalk values were calculated and the experimental selectivity parameter was further determined. The respective value is presented in Table 13.1. The results obtained with the real mixture of alkaloids (Snic/caf = 6.01) support the high selectivity values obtained with the isolated partition coefficients and validate all the optimization study previously performed. Thus, it is evident that these new IL-PEG-2000-based ABS can be used as viable separation systems of high selectivity for compounds of the same family or with similar structures if a proper selection of the IL is carried out. Since this\nis the first time that these polymer-IL-based ABS are applied to the partitioning of alkaloids, the comparison with literature data is difficult. However, several [C2mim]-and [C4mim]-based IL-ABS were previously studied in combination with K3PO4 as partitioning systems for caffeine and nicotine1. For these systems much higher partition coefficients were observed, and even complete extractions were verified in the presence of the strong salting-out species, K3PO41. Nevertheless, if we consider their capability to selectively separate the alkaloids they are by far less efficient than the systems studied in this work (0.93 &lt;Snic/caf (PEG 2000 + IL) &lt;9.90 and 1.01 &lt;Snic/caf (K3PO4 + IL) &lt;2.02). The systems here proposed provide a milder extraction but with a more selective character allowing the separation of very similar biomolecules such the caffeine and xanthine.\nFigure 13.6 A) Spectra of the diluted aqueous solutions of nicotine, caffeine and a mixture containing nicotine + caffeine ; B) Spectra of the diluted IL- and PEG-rich phases of the ABS composed of PEG 2000 (~53 wt%) + [OHC2mim]Cl (~27 wt%) containing both alkaloids at (323 \u00b1 1) K.\nTable 13.1 Partition coefficients of nicotine (Knic) and caffeine (Kcaf), and selectivity parameters for the nicotine + caffeine (SnicCcaf) pair in the ABS composed of PEG 2000 (~53 wt%) + [OHC2mim]Cl (~27 wt%) at 323 (\u00b1 1) K.\nAlkaloid aqueous solution\tKnic\tKcaf\tc Snic/caf\nNicotine\t2.67\t-\t9.90\nCaffeine\t-\t0.27\t\nNicotine + Caffeine\t1.86\t0.31\t6.01\nThe temperature of equilibrium for the alkaloids\u2019\t\tseparation\twas also investigated\nmaking use of the ABS composed\tof PEG 2000 +\t[C2mim]Cl\tWith this system the\npartition coefficients of both nicotine and caffeine were determined. The detailed partition coefficients are presented in Supporting Information (Table S13.2). The gathered results are depicted in Figure 13.7.\nFigure 13.7 Logarithm of the alkaloids partition coefficients (log Kalk) in the ABS composed of PEG 2000 (~ 53 wt%) + [C2mim]Cl (~ 27 wt%) and different temperatures.\nThe data obtained show that an increase in temperature leads to a higher extraction of nicotine for the IL-rich phase and to a decrease on the partition coefficient of caffeine for the polymer-rich phase. Nevertheless, the effect of temperature is more evident in the extraction of nicotine for the IL-rich phase in the 323-363 (\u00b11) K temperature range.\nThe preferential partitioning of both alkaloids and their different dependence with temperature has a significant impact in the selectivity values. The selectivity values of nicotine to caffeine as a function of temperature are presented in Figure 13.5(B). The increase in temperature improves the selectivity of the system with a maximum that seems to be achieved at around 353 (\u00b11) K, meaning that there is an optimal temperature with the highest selectivity.\nEquations. 13.2 to 13.420, 21. The plots of ln Kaik versus 1/T are shown in Supporting Information (Figure S13.4). The representation of ln K as a function of 1/T is well described by a linear function indicating that the molar enthalpy of transfer for caffeine and nicotine is temperature independent (at least in the temperature range studied in this work).\nThe thermodynamic parameters of transfer are presented in Table 13.2. The A trG^ of nicotine is negative and reflects the spontaneous and preferential partitioning of this alkaloid for the IL-rich phase with Knic > 1. On the other hand, for caffeine, the A trGm is positive - a result of the preferential migration of caffeine for the polymer-rich phase (Kcaf &lt;1).\nTable 13.2 Standard molar thermodynamic functions of transfer for nicotine and caffeine at 323 K.\nAlkaloid\tA trH\u00b0m / kJ.mol-1\tA trS\u00b0m / J.mol-1K-1\tA tr / kJ.mol-1\tTA trS\u00b0m / kJ.mol-1\tlnKajk\nCaffeine\t-5.44\t-28.74\t3.84\t-9.29\t-1.43\nNicotine\t-14.85\t-43.13\t-0.91\t-13.94\t0.34\nThe\tis negative for both alkaloids, suggesting that the transference of nicotine\nand caffeine from the polymer- to the IL-rich phase is an exothermic process, e.g., an increase in temperature favours the migration for the IL-rich phase. Although the partitioning of nicotine is an exothermic process it was verified that an increase in temperature seems to contradict this behaviour. Albeit this is a not expected trend, this lower affinity for the PEG-2000-rich phase with an increase in temperature can be related with the lower water content and more \u201chydrophobic\u201d character of the PEG-rich phase at higher temperatures24. Finally, when comparing the absolute values of TA t and A t for the systems with the two alkaloids it can be seen that the enthalpy of transfer is lower for the caffeine migration and slightly higher when considering the nicotine partitioning. Therefore, the enthalpic effects are of more importance in the systems comprising nicotine.\nTaking into account all the gathered results it can be concluded that the IL-polymer-based ABS here studied can be used to selectively separate similar alkaloids. These ABS can be envisaged as potential separation platforms to be applied in CCC techniques.\n13.5.\tConclusions\nIn this work, alternative IL-PEG-2000-based ABS were investigated as novel extractive systems aiming at gathering a selective separation of similar solutes. To such an aim it was studied the effect of the IL chemical structure and temperature of equilibrium. The preferential partitioning of three alkaloids (caffeine, xanthine and nicotine) was addressed by means of the measured partition coefficients and calculated selectivity values. In almost all examples it was observed a preferential concentration of caffeine into the PEG-2000-rich phase whereas nicotine and xanthine preferentially migrate to the (opposite) IL-rich phase. Therefore, despite their chemical similarities, the three alkaloids suffer different partitioning trends between the coexisting phases of the studied ABS. Selectivity values of xanthine in respect to caffeine up to 19 were attained with the system composed of [C2mim][CH3CQ2]. The promising results here obtained show that polymer-IL-based ABS allow the selective separation of similar structures by a proper manipulation of the ILs chemical structure and temperature of equilibrium, and can be envisaged as potential platforms to be applied in CCC.\n13.6.\tReferences\n1.\tFreire, M.G., Neves, C.M.S.S., Marrucho, I.M., Canongia Lopes, J.N., Rebelo, L.P.N., and Coutinho, J.A.P., High-performance extraction of alkaloids using aqueous two-phase systems with ionic liquids.

The influence of the IL chemical structure, PEG molecular weight and temperature on the ABS formation is investigated. Ternary liquid-liquid phase diagrams, binary water activities, PEG-IL miscibility data, and binary and ternary excess enthalpies estimated using COSMO-RS were used to derive information leading to a molecular-level mechanism for the phase separation. The multiple approaches used concur to demonstrate that the ABS formation on these systems is not the results of a salting-out mechanism but instead indicate that the specific interactions occurring between the IL anion and the PEG hydroxyl groups control the IL-PEG mutual solubilities and the ABS formation.\n14.2.\tIntroduction\nIn the previous chapters we have demonstrated that it is possible to control the phases' polarities by an adequate selection of the IL chemical structure - . Nevertheless, only ILs such as imidazolium-, pyrrolidinium-, pyridinium- and piperidinium-based have been investigated - . Several of these cations possess some toxicity and are poorly biodegradable, albeit side chain modifications may enhance their primary biodegradability potential and decrease their toxicity4-6. Moreover, if a large-scale application of these systems is envisaged, it is still hampered by the high price of certain ILs. Therefore, the ample versatility of ILs that can be synthesized should permit the creation of new fluids with an acceptable environmental footprint and enhanced biocompatibility, as well as of low cost.\nCholine chloride (2-hydroxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride) is a water soluble essential nutrient important for cell membrane structure and for synthesizing folic acid and vitamin B127. Although, choline chloride is a salt with a high melting temperature o\n(302\u00b0C) , and recent advances have offered the synthesis of novel cholinium-based ILs ([Ch]-based ILs) conjugated with different anions9-11. These ILs present outstanding biodegradability12, 13 and low toxicity to filamentous fungi and the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna11. Furthermore, a number of works have described novel [Ch]-based ILs in which protein structure and enzyme function can be maintained or\neven increased9, 10, 14, 15. Due to these exceptional properties, their interest promptly increased in the past few years, with applications as diverse as crosslinking agents for collagen-based materials16, in the pre-treatment and dissolution of biomass17, 18, or as co-substrates for microorganisms in the degradation of dyes . In addition, this new class of ILs is generally accessible, easy to handle, and cheaper than more common ILs.\nHaving in mind the plausible application of ABS for the extraction of added-value compounds and their mandatory biocompatibility and biodegradability issues, a new class of aqueous biphasic systems composed of [Ch]-based ILs and an inorganic salt was recently proposed while some authors also reported the possibility to form ABS with polypropylene glycol (PPG) and [Ch]-based ILs19-21. It was suggested that the [Ch]-based ILs can either act as the salting-out species of the the moderately hydrophobic PPG or being salted-out by a high charge density salt19-21. The molecular level mechanism of two-phase formation would be ruled by the formation of hydration complexes and/or the ions affinity for water19-21. While the mechanism for ABS formation in PPG + [Ch]-based ILs requires further confirmation, for a more hydrophilic polymer, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), the molecular phenomenon which governs the formation of an immiscible regime becomes more complex as will be presented and described herein. To this end, the ternary phase diagrams, tie-lines and tie-line lengths of several ABS composed of PEGs and [Ch]-based ILs were determined. A broad range of structurally distinct [Ch]-based ILs, PEGs of different molecular weights, and different temperatures were used to evaluate their impact into ABS formation and to gather evidence that could help to the specific interactions dominating the phase behaviour. Moreover, the binary PEG-IL solubility, their enthalpies of mixing, the water activities of the various compounds and were also used so that the molecular insights on the molecular mechanism of liquid-liquid demixing could be understood.\n14.3.\tExperimental Section\n14.3.1.\tMaterials\nThe following cholinium-based ILs were acquired from Sigma: cholinium chloride, [Ch]Cl, cholinium bicarbonate, [Ch]Bic, cholinium bitartrate, [Ch]Bit, and cholinium dihydrogencitrate, [Ch]DHcit. The cholinium acetate, [Ch]Ac, and cholinium\ndihydrogenphosphate, [Ch]DHph, and. Cholinium glycolate, [Ch]Gly, were obtained from Iolitec. Cholinium propanoate, [Ch]Pro, Cholinium butanoate, [Ch]But, and Cholinium Lactate, [Ch]Lac, were synthesized according to standard protocols , ,\t.\nAll the ILs were dried under constant agitation and vacuum, at a moderate temperature (323 K), for a minimum of 48h, to reduce the volatile compounds and water contents to negligible values. After this procedure, H and C NMR was employed to evaluate the purity of each sample. All ILs present a purity level higher than 98 wt%.\nPEGs of average molecular weights 400 g.mol-1, 600 g.mol-1 and 1000 g.mol-1 (abbreviated as PEG 400, PEG 600 and PEG 1000, respectively) were supplied by Fluka, and used as received.\nThe water used was double distilled, passed across a reverse osmosis system and further treated with a Milli-Q plus 185 water purification apparatus.\n14.3.2.\tMethods\n14.3.2.1.\tPhase Diagrams and Tie-lines\nAqueous solutions of each cholinium-based IL (from 40 wt% to 80 wt%) and aqueous solutions of each PEG (from 80 wt% to 100 wt%) were prepared and used for the determination of the binodal curves. The phase diagrams were determined by the cloud point titration method at 298 K and 323 K (\u00b1 1 K) and atmospheric pressure, according to literature procedures23, 24. The composition of each system was calculated by the weight quantification of all components added within \u00b1 10- kg. The tie-lines (TLs) were also determined and further details are provided in Supporting Information (Table S14.13).\n14.3.2.2.\tSolubility of [Ch]-based ILs in PEG 600\nThe solubility of each [Ch]-based IL in PEG 600 was determined at 298 K and atmospheric pressure. For that purpose repetitive small amounts of each IL (ca. 5 mg) were added to pre-weighed vials containing PEG 600. Then the IL and the PEG binary mixtures were agitated vigorously during 12 h at constant temperature. After this period, the vials were analysed visually, and if the maximum of solubility it was reached the vials were weighed and the respective values of wt% solubilities determined.\n14.3.2.3.\tCOSMO-RS Predictions\nThe standard procedure for COnductor-like Screening MOdel for Real Solvents (COSMO-RS) modeling consists of two major steps. First, the continuum solvation COSMO calculations of electronic density and molecular geometry of PEG 600, cholinium-based ILs, and water were performed with the TURBOMOLE 6.1 program package on the density functional theory, utilizing the BP functional B88-P86 with a triple-Z valence polarized basis set (TZVP) and the resolution of identity standard (RI) approximation . Second, the thermodynamic properties such as activity coefficient, excess enthalpy, and excess free Gibbs energy calculations was performed with the COSMOthermX_2.1 program using the parameter file BP_TZVP_C21_0111 (COSMOlogic GmbH &amp; Co KG, Leverkusen, Germany). In all calculations, the ILs are always treated by means of their isolated ions.\n14.3.\tResults and Discussion\nThe chemical structures of the studied [Ch]-based ILs or related salts are presented in Table 14.1. We have focused on the subgroup of the cholinium cation ([Ch]+) combined with several conjugated bases namely chloride (Cl-), bicarbonate (Bic-), bitartrate (Bit-), acetate (Ac-), propanoate (Pro-), butanoate (But-), dihydrogencitrate (DHcit-), glycolate (Gly-), lactate (Lac-) and dihydrogenphosphate (DHph-), to investigate their influence on the ABS formation. PEGs of average molecular weights of 400 g.mol-1, 600 g.mol-1 and 1000 g.mol-1 were used to evaluate the impact of the polymer size on the liquid-liquid immiscibility, and are abbreviated as PEG 400, PEG 600, and PEG 1000, respectively.\nTable 14.1 Chemical structure of the studied cholinium-based salts and respective octanol-water partition coefficients (Kow)26.\nCholinium butanoate\n([Ch]But)\nCholinium propanoate\n([Ch]Pro)\nCholinium chloride\n([Ch]Cl)\nCholinium acetate\n([Ch]Ac)\ncr\nN.A.*\nN.A.*\n-3.70\n-4.66\nCholinium glycolate ([Ch]Gly)\nCholinium lactate ([Ch]Lac)\nCholinium bicarbonate ([Ch]Bic)\nCholinium dihydrogencitrate ([Ch]DHcit)\nCholinium bitartrate\n([Ch]Bit)\nCholinium dihydrogenphosphate ([Ch]DHph)\n-1.20\n-3.70\n-3.70\n-1.32\n-1.43\n-3.70\n#The logKow values are a measure of the differential solubility of a particular solute between the immiscible liquids octanol and water. *N.A.: not available data.\nThe phase diagrams of all ABS composed of different PEGs and cholinium-based salts were initially determined at 298 K and atmospheric pressure. The detailed weight fraction experimental data are presented in Supporting Information (Tables S14.1 to Table S14.12). Figure 14.1 depicts the solubility curves of the systems displayed in molality units [mole of PEG per kg of (salt + water) versus [mole of sal per kg of (PEG\n+ water)] in order to avoid distortions on the comparisons that could be a direct consequence of the distinct molecular weights of the species involved. An example of the tie-lines of a particular system composed of [Ch]Cl and PEG 600 at 298 K is shown in Figure 14.2. The remaining tie-lines, tie-line lengths and solubility data correlation are shown in Supporting Information (Table S14.13). Figure 14.1 shows the influence of the anion nature of the cholinium-based salts through the phase diagrams behaviour with a common polymer, PEG 600. Although [Ch]Cl, [Ch]Ac, [Ch]Bic, [Ch]Gly, [Ch]Lac, [Ch]Bit, [Ch]DHcit and [Ch]DHph could form ABS with PEG 600, it should be remarked that [Ch]Pro and [Ch]But are not able to undergo liquid-liquid demixing in aqueous media.\n[IL] / (mol.kg1)\nFigure 14.1 Experimental solubility data for ABS composed of PEG 600 + [Ch]-based ILs at 298 K: (A) [Ch]DHph; (\u25b2) [Ch]Bit; (\u25a0) [Ch]Bic; (o) [Ch]DHcit; (\u25ca) [Ch]Lac; (\u25a1) [Ch]Gly; (\u2022) [Ch]Ac; (\u2666) [Ch]Cl.\nFigure 14.2 Ternary phase diagram of the ABS composed of [Ch]Cl and PEG at 298 K: (\u2666) binodal curve data; (-) binodal adjusted curve; (\u25a1) TL data.\nThe ability of the [Ch]-based ILs or related salts to promote PEG-based ABS follows the trend: [Ch]DHph > [Ch]Bit > [Ch]DHcit ~ [Ch]Bic > [Ch]Lac ~ [Ch]Gly ~ [Ch]Ac > [Ch]Cl. Even though this trend is only presented here for a common polymer (PEG 600) the data for the remaining PEGs of different molecular weight follows a similar pattern and are presented Supporting Information (Figures S14.1 and S14.2). In the majority of the systems the bottom phase is the cholinium-rich phase whereas the top phase corresponds to the PEG-rich phase. However, particular inversions on the phase densities were observed with [Ch]Cl and [Ch]Ac. A detailed description of the bottom and top phases in each system is provided in Supporting Information (Table S14.14). Since both phases are liquid and non-coloured, the coexisting phases were identified by conductivity measurements at 298 K. The conductivity values are also shown in Supporting Information (Table S14.14).\nAlbeit in more conventional systems involving aqueous mixtures of ILs and high charge density salts the liquid-liquid demixing has been reported as being the result of a salting-out phenomenon23, 27, 28, i.e., the salt ions are preferentially hydrated and lead to the exclusion of the more \u201chydrophobic\u201d IL for a second liquid phase, the scenario occurring in ABS composed of ILs and PEG is more complex2. Previously, we have\nshown that [Ch]-based ILs are also capable of forming salt-salt ABS by a salting-out phenomenon induced by a high charge density salt, K3PO4 . As typically observed with IL-salt ABS the liquid-liquid demixing ability is the result of the enhanced aptitude of the phosphate anion to be hydrated23, 24. When dealing with ABS composed of ILs and a more hydrophobic polymer, such as PPG, the mechanisms of phase separation have been explained as a salting-out effect induced by the IL on the polymer in aqueous media19, 20. Limited or no evidence is, however, available to sustain such hypothesis. When addressing a more hydrophilic polymer, such as PEG, the water hydration capability of the IL ions does not seem to control the phase separation aptitude of PEG-IL-based ABS . Contrarily to IL-salt-based ABS, in all the investigated PEG-based systems the water content is lower than 30 wt%, with the exception of [Ch]DHph with approx. 50 wt% of total water. Thus, in most examples, thereis a 1:1:1 volumetric fraction of the [Ch]-based IL, PEG and water, and all the binary specific interactions occurring within the IL-PEG, IL-water and PEG-water cannot be discarded.\nThe first factor suggesting that the IL affinity for water does not control the ABS phase behaviour is the octanol-water partition coefficient (Kow) of each fluid. The Kow values are a measure of the differential solubility of a particular solute between two immiscible solvents - octanol and water -and are presented in Table 14.1. In more conventional systems of the type IL + salt, and for a common salt, the phases\u2019 formation ability is dominated by the ILs affinity for water and clearly correlates with the Kow values . ILs with lower affinity for water, i.e. more hydrophobic fluids, are more easily excluded to a second liquid phase. In PEG-[Ch]-based IL systems there is no dependence on the Kow values. This odd behaviour is thus an indication that the formation of ABS composed of [Ch]-based ILs and PEGs are not the result of a salting-out effect of the ionic species over the polymer. Moreover although [Ch]Cl is a weaker salting out agent than most inorganic chloride based salts, it is impossible to generate an ABS with these while this is straightforward with [Ch]Cl, as shown in Figures 14.1 and 14.2, as well as with other Cl-based ionic liquids2.\n29\nRecently , the water activity of isolated [Ch]-based ILs has been reported. Figure 14.3 shows a comparison of the water activity at 298 K of the PEG 600 (measured here) and of various ILs here studies as a function of the IL/PEG weight fraction.\nFigure 14.3 Experimental water activities data at 298 K: (\u2022) PEG 600; (o) [Ch]DHcit; (\u25b2) [Ch]Bit; (A)\n[Ch]DHph; (\u25a0) [Ch]Bic; (\u2022) [Ch]Ac; (\u2666) [Ch]Cl. The data shown for the ILs was adapted from Khan et\nal29.\nThe water activity values allow a further evaluation if the water-IL interactions, or the aptitude of the isolated ions to be hydrated, govern the ABS formation. They show that the anions with higher ability to interact with water, such as Cl- and Ac-, are those that display a lower capability to promote an ABS with PEG. On the opposite order, the anions Bit- and DHcit-are those that present a lower affinity for water, and yet have a stronger phase separation capability. These results clearly show that the ions with higher ability to form hydration complexes are not those with higher capability to induce phase separation, meaning that the formation of PEG-[Ch]-based IL ABS is not driven by a salting-out phenomenon.\nIn order to gather further insights on the dominant interactions in PEG-[Ch]-based IL ABS, the solubility of each IL in PEG 600 was determined at 298K. The solubility data are presented inTable 14.2. The higher solubility in PEG reveals a higher affinity and the presence of strong favourable interactions with the polymer. As observed in Table\n14.2,\tthe [Ch]But and [Ch]Prop are completely soluble with PEG in all the composition range. This behaviour is indicative of strong IL-PEG interactions, and this explains why these compounds are not able to create an ABS with PEG. When evaluating the remaining [Ch]-based ILs capable of forming ABS, it is clear that the compounds\ncomposed of the anions with higher solubilities in the polymer, such as Ac- and Cl-based ILs, display a lower ability to phase separate in aqueous media. However, with the ILs whose solubility is lower than 0.005 mol.kg-1, the phase separation occurs at lower concentrations of these solutes.\nTable 14.2 Solubilities of several [Ch]-based ILs in PEG 600 (expressed in molality) at 298 K and atmospheric pressure.\n[Ch]-based ILs\tMolality / (mol.kg-1)\n[Ch]But\tcompletely soluble\n[Ch]Pro\tcompletely soluble\n[Ch]Ac\t4.473\n[Ch]Gly\t-\n[Ch]Lac\t-\n[Ch]Cl\t0.260\n[Ch]DHcit\t&lt;0.005\n[Ch]Bit\t&lt;0.005\nThese results provide clear indications that the PEG-IL interactions dominate the ABS formation. Therefore, in order to obtain additional evidence on the molecular mechanisms which rule the two phases formation, we have further employed CQSMQ-RS, a predictive model based on unimolecular quantum chemistry calculations, to explore the excess enthalpies at 298 K. CQSMQ-RS was used here to study the interactions on the following binary pairs: PEG-water, IL-water and IL-PEG. The ternary mixture composed of PEG + IL + water was also evaluated. It should be remarked that Khan et al. already demonstrated the accuracy of CQSMQ-RS in predicting the water activity coefficients of cholinium-based ILs supporting the validity of the CQSMQ-RS predictions obtained here. The liquid-liquid equilibrium description by CQSMQ-RS (cf. Supporting Information, Figures S14.8 and S14.9) demonstrates favourable interactions between the first two binary mixtures, PEG-water and IL-water, as evidenced by the negative excess enthalpies, H\\ and excess free Gibbs energy, GE, throughout the whole composition range. In all examples, H-bonding is the dominant interaction occurring in these binary mixtures. The ILs [Ch]Cl and [Ch]Ac display the higher energy interactions with water; yet, they present a lower ability to promote the phase separation. Qn the opposite, the ILs [Ch]Bit and [Ch]DHcit reveal the lower values of total energy interactions with water and are the most effective in creating\nABS. These results again indicate that the hydration aptitude of the IL ions is not ruling the ABS phase behaviour.\nThe excess enthalpies of mixing of the IL anions with PEG 600 in aqueous media are shown in Figure 14.4. ILs with the Ac- and Cl- anions, with lower abilities to promote the ABS phase separation, present stronger interactions with PEG 600 as reflected by the highly negative H values. On the other hand, the ILs containing the DHcit- and DHph- anions display the less negative HE values, indicative of weaker binary interactions, and are the more able to induce the liquid-liquid demixing in PEG-based ABS. In this context, ILs with stronger interactions with PEG are more difficult to phase separate and vice-versa.\nFigure 14.4 Excess enthalpies of mixing between PEG 600 and the IL anion predicted by COSMO-RS as a function of the polymer mole fraction: (A) [Ch]DHph; (\u25b2) [Ch]Bit; (o) [Ch]DHcit; (\u25a0) [Ch]Bic; (\u25ca) [Ch]Lac; (\u25a1) [Ch]Gly; (\u2022) [Ch]Ac; (\u2666) [Ch]Cl.\nCOSMO-RS was also used to evaluate the molecular phenomena occurring in the ternary mixtures, IL-PEG-water, using the predicted excess enthalpies and taking into account the contribution of each species. The respective results are shown in Supporting Information (Figure S14.10). The liquid-liquid equilibrium predicted by COSMO-RS shows that the favourable interactions that occur in the ABS arises mainly from PEG 600 and the IL anion. The cholinium cation also negatively contributes to the excess enthalpies of the mixture, but its contribution is slightly affected by the concentration of\nPEG 600. Meanwhile, the contribution of water to the excess enthalpies was found to be positive, which indicates stronger interactions of water in its pure state rather than in the ternary mixtures.\nIn summary, Figure 14.4 presents the comparison of excess enthalpies of mixing highlighting the contribution of the IL anion. The favourable PEG-IL interactions can be ranked as follows: DHph-&lt;Bit-&lt;DHCit- &lt;Bic-&lt;Lac-&lt;Gly-&lt;Ac-&lt;Cl-. This sequence closely follows that observed with the IL anion trend to create ABS. In addition, the dominant specific interaction, as expected, is the H-bonding between the terminal hydroxyl groups of PEG and the IL anion. It can thus be concluded that the PEG-IL interactions rule the formation of the respective ABS mediated by an H-bonding network. It should be highlighted that the significance of H-bonding in binary mixtures of PEGs and imidazolium-based ILs was already stated by Rogers and coworkers making use of binary liquid-liquid equilibrium data.\nThe effect of the molecular weight of the polymer through the ABS formation aptitude was also addressed. Figure 14.5 depicts the phase diagrams for ternary systems containing PEG 400 and PEG 1000 combined with fixed cholinium-based salts. The remaining data are shown in Supporting Information (Figures S14.3 to S14.7).\n6\n0\t2\t4\t6\n[IL] / (mol. kg1)\nFigure 14.5 Experimental solubility data for ABS composed of PEG + [Ch]-based ILs at 298 K: (\u25ca) PEG 1000/[Ch]DHph; (o) PEG 600/[Ch]DHph; (A) PEG 400/[Ch]DHph; (*)PEG 1000/[Ch]Cl; (\u2022) PEG 600/[Ch]Cl; (\u25b2) PEG 400/[Ch]Cl.\nFor all the studied ILs the ability of the polymer for inducing the liquid-liquid demixing follows the order: PEG 1000 > PEG 600 > PEG 400. The higher the molecular weight of PEG the higher the ability of the system to form two macroscopic liquid phases. The same trend has been observed in conventional polymer/salt ABS - and, more recently, on PEG/imidazolium-based ILs containing systems2. This trend can be related to both an increasing hydrophobic character of PEG with the molecular weight, and thus to a lower affinity for water, and to a decreased miscibility with the ILs. In binary systems of the type PEG-IL it was already reported a decreasing solubility of the IL in the polymer-rich phase with increasing molecular weight of the PEG that was attributed to the lower ratio of terminal -OH groups which limit the sites for the hydrogen bonding of the IL anion30. The predicted HE values also show to be less negative with the increase of the PEG molecular weight. In this particular example, electrostatic, H-bonding, and van der Walls interactions all contribute to less negative values of enthalpy of mixing. The respective predictions are shown in Supporting Information (Figures S 14.11 and S14.12).\nTo infer about the temperature effect on the ability to liquid-liquid demixing, the ABS of [Ch]-based ILs with the highest and lowest ability to promote the phase separation, [Ch]Cl and [Ch]DHph, respectively, were determined at 298 K and 323 K. The respective phase diagrams are presented in Figure 14.6. The detailed weight fraction data are reported in Supporting Information (Table S14.11).\nFigure 14.6 Experimental solubility data for ABS composed of PEG 600 + [Ch]-based ILs: (o) PEG 600/[Ch]DHph at 323K; (A) PEG 600/[Ch]DHph at 298K; (\u2666) PEG 600/[Ch]Cl at 298K; (\u2022) PEG 600/[Ch]Cl at 323K.\nThe binodal curves show that in both cases an increase in temperature enhances the immiscibility region. This pattern is in close agreement with that observed before for typical PEG/salt systems34 and for PPG/[Ch]-based ABS35, 36. On the other hand, the temperature effect was shown to be the opposite in ABS composed of PEG 2000 and imidazolium-based ILs . In those systems the influence of temperature in the liquidliquid demixing seems to be dominated by the hydrogen bonding, presenting a lower critical solution temperature-type behaviour as observed for the PEG-water binary mixtures . For systems dominated by this type of interaction an increase in temperature leads to a decrease on the interactions and consequently to a liquid-liquid demixing. The COSMO-RS H values provided in Supporting Information (Figures S14.13) and support this statement.\nIn summary, based on the ternary phase diagrams, solubility data of each IL in PEG, ILs water activities and excess enthalpies, this work shows that the H-bonding occurring between the IL anion and the terminal -OH groups of the polymer rule the formation aptitude of PEG-IL-based ABS. Contrarily, to more conventional systems composed of ILs and salts, in which the formation of hydration complexes governs the liquid-liquid\ndemixing by a salting-out mechanism, the PEG-IL-based ABS are by far more complex and are ruled by the interactions occurring between the PEG and the [Ch]-based ILs.\n14.5.\tConclusions\nIt was here shown, for the first time, that biocompatible IL-polymer-based ABS can be formed by the combination of cholinium-based salts and PEGs. Using a large array of cholinium-based ILs and polymers it was demonstrated that the specific interactions occurring between the IL anion and the -QH terminal groups of the polymer control the ABS formation.\nAlbeit favourable interactions are also observed within the IL-water and PEG-water pairs, ILs with strong interactions with the polymer are more difficult to phase separate in aqueous media. An increase of the polymer molecular weight also leads to larger immiscibility regions, thus higher ABS formation ability, due to a decrease on the PEG-IL mutual solubility. Furthermore, an increase in temperature promotes the ability of the systems to phase separate. Higher temperatures weaken the H-bonding interactions occurring in PEG-IL and thereby facilitate the respective separation.\n14.6.\tReferences\n1.\tPereira,\tVicente, F., Santos-Ebinuma, V.C., Ara\u00fajo, J.M., Pessoa, A., Freire,\nM.G., and Coutinho, J.A.P., Extraction of tetracycline from fermentation broth using aqueous two-phase systems composed of polyethylene glycol and cholinium-based salts.

Conventional polymer/salt and salt/salt ABS were also studied for comparison purposes. The novel systems here proposed are able to extract tetracycline directly from the fermentation broth with extraction efficiencies higher than 80%. A tailored extraction ability of these systems can also be achieved, with preferential extractions either for to the polymer- or salt-rich phases, and which further depend on the cholinium-based salt employed. The gathered results support the applicability of biocompatible ABS in the extraction of antibiotics from complex matrices and can be envisaged as valuable platforms to be applied at the industrial level by pharmaceutical companies.\nKeywords: Tetracycline, Streptomyces aurofaciens, extraction, aqueous two-phase systems, cholinium-based salts.\n15.2.\tIntroduction\nThe study of alternative techniques for the extraction of antibiotics is the main goal of the second part of this thesis. As described in chapter 8, among the several classes of antibiotics, the Tetracycline (TC) appears as one of the most important and broad spectrum antibiotic class used nowadays. Thus, after the extensive study of novel PEG/IL-based ABS presented in the previous chapters, in this chapter it is shown the separation and extraction of tetracycline produced by Streptomyces aureofaciens making use of the novel IL-PEG-based ABS investigated.\nAs stated on the previous chapters, the main advantages of polymer-salt or polymer-IL ABS, when compared to polymer-polymer systems, relay on their lower viscosities and possibility of changing the polarities of the coexisting phases. Moreover, they usually display a quick phase separation and high extraction efficiencies which can be easily manipulated by a proper selection of the ions composing a given IL or salt1. Indeed, ILbased ABS have been successfully used in the separation, concentration and purification of proteins, antioxidants, metal ions, alkaloids and antibiotics1. However, most ILs are\npoorly biodegradable and of low biocompatibility. In this context, ILs and salts based on the cholinium cation can be a valuable alternative; yet, poorly studied. These cholinium-based salts, or ionic liquids (ILs) when their melting point is below 100 \u00b0C, are constituted by the 2-hydroxyethyl-V,V,V-trimethylammonium cation combined with anions as diverse as chloride, bicarbonate, acetate, levulinate, malate, glycolate, among others. Hence, the cholinium-based salts/ILs are a feasible option to be used in the formation of ABS. The possibility of creating aqueous two-phase systems of the type polymer-salt or salt-salt either by the combination of PEG and cholinium-based salts or by the addition of an inorganic salt to mildly hydrophobic cholinium-based ILs was previously demonstrated , . Aiming at exploring the applicability of these novel ABS, this work is focused on the extraction of tetracycline directly from the fermentation broth of S. aureofaciens. Systems composed of polyethylene glycol 600 and cholinium-based salts were investigated by means of the partition coefficients and extraction efficiencies obtained for tetracycline. To further ascertain on the enhanced ability of these novel systems to extract tetracycline, further experiments were carried out with conventional polymer/salt and salt/salt ABS for comparison purposes.\n15.3.\tMaterials and Methods\n15.3.1.\tMaterials\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) with an average molecular weight of 600 g.mol-1 (abbreviated as PEG 600) and tetracycline (TC), > 98 wt% pure, were supplied by Fluka. The cholinium-based salts were acquired at Sigma-Aldrich: cholinium chloride, [Ch]Cl, cholinium bicarbonate, [Ch]Bic, and cholinium dihydrogencitrate, [Ch]DHcit, with purities of > 98 wt%, 80 wt% (in aqueous solution), and 99 wt%, respectively. The cholinium acetate, [Ch]Ac, and cholinium dihydrogenphosphate, [Ch]DHph, were purchased from Iolitec with purity levels of 98 wt%. These last two cholinium-based salts fall within the category of ILs since they present melting temperatures below 100\u00b0C. Nevertheless, to avoid any ambiguity, all these materials will be thereinafter referred as cholinium-based salts. The chemical structures of the investigated cholinium-based salts are presented in Table 15.1. H and C NMR spectra were performed to evaluate the purity of each sample. All samples are of high purity and agree with the purity levels indicated by the suppliers. The inorganic salts K3PO4 (> 98\nwt%) and Na2SO4 (> 99.0 wt%) were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich and LabSolve, respectively. All the other reagents are of analytical grade and were used as received.\nTable 15.1 Chemical structures of the studied cholinium-based salts.\nCholinium-based salts\nAnion\n[Ch]Bic\nOH\n[Ch]Cl\n[Ch]Ac\n[Ch]DHcit\n[Ch]DHph\n15.3.2.\tMicroorganism Maintenance and Fermentation Processes\nS. aureofaciens was kindly provided by the Microorganism Collection of the Department of Antibiotics from Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, PE, Brazil. The frozen microorganism was maintained at -70\u00b0C with glycerol in a cryotube. According to the procedure described by Darken et al.4, a thick spore suspension contained in the cryotube was transferred to 25 mL of reactivation medium in 250 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks. After an incubation period of 24 h in an orbital shaker at 30 \u00b0C and 200 rpm, 5 mL of this suspension were added to 45 mL of the fermentation medium and re-incubated under the same conditions of reactivation during 48 h (at this condition the pH value was 4.50 \u00b1 0.04). For the fermentation processes, 5.0 mL of the resulting cell suspension were added to 45 mL of fermentation medium in 500 mL-Erlenmeyer flasks and incubated during 120 h at the same operational conditions. At the end of the fermentation process, the fermented broth was filtrated through a Whatman N. 4 paper and then centrifuged at 3720 g for 15 min at 5\u00b0C. The supernatant obtained from this process presented a final pH of 4.27 \u00b1 0.09 and a TC concentration of 0.175 g.L-1 (quantified as described below). The supernatant was frozen and stored in an ultrafreezer at -70\u00b0C and further used in all the partitioning studies.\n15.3.3.\tMedia Composition\nA modified liquid ISP-2 medium5 with a constitution of 4.0 g.L-1 of yeast extract and 10.0 g.L-1 of malt extract was used for reactivation. The medium proposed by Darken et al.4 for the preparation of the Streptomyces aureofaciens inoculum was used and it is composed as follows (g.L-1 in deionized water): sucrose (30.0), soybean meal (5.0), NasC6H5O7.5H2O (1.0), (NH4)1SO4 (3.3), MgSO4.7H2O (0.25), KH2PO4 (0.10), K2HPO4 (0.10), CaCO3 (1.0), MnSO4.4H2O (0.01), ZnSO4.7H2O (0.04), ICCi^Of (0.000016) and CH3COOH (0.40). The fermentation medium was prepared according to the description given by Darken et al.4 and it is composed of: H3C6H5O7.H2O (12.8), sucrose (40.0), (NH4hSO4 (6.0), MgSO4.7H2O (0.25), KH2PO4 (0.15), CaCO3 (11.0), MnSO4.4H2O (0.01), ZnSO4.7H2O (0.04) and K2Cr2O7 (0.016.10-3). All media were autoclaved at 121\u00b0C for 15 min.\n15.3.4.\tMethods\n15.3.4.1.\tPhase Diagrams and Tie-lines\nPhase diagrams for each ternary system composed of PEG 600 + cholinium-based salt + H2O at 25\u00b0C were previously determined3 using the cloud point titration method. Other ABS used for comparison purposes were taken from literature2, 6. The knowledge of these phase diagrams allows the choice of mixture points which correspond to a liquidliquid two-phase system.\n15.3.4.2.\tOptimization of the TC Partitioning in ABS Composed of PEG and Cholinium-based Salts\nIn order to optimize the experimental conditions and phase compositions to be applied in the extraction of TC from the fermented broth, several model systems were initially investigated making use of commercial TC of high purity. Three different mixture compositions at the biphasic region, and for each ABS, were selected. Small amounts of commercial TC, 0.25-0.45 mg, were added to glass tubes containing the appropriate weights of PEG, [Ch]-salt and water to form a system with a total mass of 5 g. After the equilibration time, 12 h at 25 (\u00b11)\u00b0C, the phases were carefully separated and the quantification of TC in both phases was carried out. The quantification of tetracycline is\ndescribed below. All the assays were performed in triplicate and the respective standard deviations were determined.\nThe partition coefficient of TC, KTC, is the ratio between the antibiotic concentration in the PEG-rich phase ([TC]PEG) to that in the cholinium-rich phase ([TC]Ch) and as described by Equation 15.1:\nKTc\n]P\u00a3G\n[TC ]cft\nEquation 15.1\n15.3.4.3.\tPartitioning of TC in Conventional PEG/Na2SO4 and [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 ABS\nFor comparison purposes and to ascertain on the potential of PEG-cholinium-based ABS as improved extraction routes, the KTC data were also determined in two mixture points (biphasic systems) of the PEG 600 + Na2SO4+ water system and for three mixture compositions of the [Ch]Cl + K3PO4+ water ABS. The partitioning studies were carried out in triplicate and at 25 (\u00b11)\u00b0C, and in accordance to the procedure previously described.\nThe partition coefficient of TC for the PEG-rich phase (KTC_PEG) in the PEG/Na2SO4 system and for the cholinium-rich phase (KTC_Ch) in the [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 system were determined according to Equations 15.2 and 15.3, respectively:\nKtc_peg\n[TC ]P\u00a3 g\n[TC ]sa/t\nEquation 15.2\nKtc _Ch\n[TC ]cft\n[TC ]sa/t\nEquation 15.3\nwhere [TC]PEG, [TC]salt and [TC]Ch correspond, respectively, to the TC concentration in the PEG-rich, in the inorganic-salt-rich and in the cholinium-rich phase.\n15.3.4.4.\tRecovery of TC from the Fermented Broth\nThe novel PEG/[Ch]Bic and PEG/[Ch]Cl ABS and the conventional PEG/Na2SO4 and [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 aqueous systems were also used in the investigation of the recovery/extraction of TC from the fermentation broth of S. aureofaciens. The corresponding systems were prepared by choosing the mixture composition for which\nthe highest partition coefficient was obtained in the optimization step with the model systems previously addressed. The partitioning studies were performed adding directly the liquid supernatant of the fermented broth to known amounts of polymer and cholinium-based salt. The partitioning behavior of TC was quantified in terms of the respective partitioning coefficients in the several ABS, namely KTC (for the PEG 600/[Ch]-based salts ABS), KTC_PEG (for the PEG/Na2SO4 ABS) and KTC_Ch (for the [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 ABS), as described above.\nThe percentage extraction efficiency of TC (%EEtC) for a given phase, e.g. the phase with higher TC concentration, was also evaluated through Equation 15.4:\nn/ r-\u2019r\u00bb\tmTC\u2014rich phase -inn\n%EEtc = ---------------X 100\n0\tEquation 15.4\nwhere mTC-rich phase is the mass of TC in the phase with higher TC concentration and m0 is the total mass of tetracycline in each system.\n15.3.4.5.\tQuantification of Tetracycline\nThe TC concentration in each ABS phase was determined using an UV-Vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU UV-1700, Pharma-Spect Spectrometer). The UV-Vis spectrum of TC was firstly obtained and calibration curves were properly established at a neutral and alkaline pH since diverse salts can induce different pH values (cf. Supporting Information Data, Figures S15.1 to S.15.4). TC shows two distinct wavelengths were maxima in absorbance are observed: (i) at neutral pH the biomolecule has no charge and these maxima occur at 276 nm and 357 nm; (ii) at an alkaline pH, the molecule is negatively charged, and these maxima occur at 269 nm and 381 nm. In the partitioning studies using the fermented broth of S. aureofaciens it was not possible to quantify the TC at 276 nm and 269 nm since the proteins present in the broth also contribute to the absorption observed at these wavelengths7. Therefore, the TC was measured using the calibration curves established at 357 and 381 nm, for the neutral and alkaline systems, respectively. The validation of the TC quantification using the calibration curves determined at 357 and 381 nm was additionally confirmed taking into account the difference between the total protein concentration ([TP]) present in the\no\nfermented broth, which was determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (BCA)8, and the protein concentration ([PBSA]) obtained by a calibration curve making use of\nBovine Serum Albumin (BSA) at 280 nm. The difference between the total absorbance and the BSA absorbance at 280 nm gives the TC absorbance. The TC concentration of the fermented broth measured by the second set of calibration curves is similar (within \u00b1 5%) to that obtained by the measurement of the absorbance in the first maximum wavelength peaks for the UV region (cf. Supporting Information, Table S15.1) and validate the experimental procedure adopted.\n15.3.4.6.\tpH and Conductivity Measurements\nAfter the separation of the coexisting phases of each system, the pH values (\u00b1 0.02) and conductivity (\u00b1 0.01 mS.cm-1) were measured at 25 (\u00b11)\u00b0C using a SevenMultiTM equipment (Mettler Toledo Instruments). The conductivity measurements were used to identify the polymer and the salt-rich phases since they are colorless in most of the cases.\n15.4.\tResults and Discussion\n15.4.1.\tOptimization of the TC Partitioning in ABS Composed of PEG and Cholinium-based Salts\nIn order to optimize the TC partitioning, different cholinium-based salts were used in combination with PEG 600 to form an ABS. In this study, the cholinium-based salts investigated were [Ch]Cl, [Ch]Bic, [CH]DHcit, [Ch]Ac and [Ch]DHph. The initial mixture compositions were selected so that the liquid-liquid systems could be formed taking into account previous literature data with their phase diagrams . The initial mixture compositions, the partition coefficients of tetracycline and the pH values of the phases are presented in Table 15.2. Based on the initial mixture compositions and the respective ternary phase diagrams , the composition of each phase was further determined, and the corresponding tie-lines are presented in Supporting Information, Table S15.2. The tie-line length (TLL) corresponds to the length of each tie-line and indicates the difference in composition of the two phases. The values of the TLLs are presented in Table 15.2.\nTable 15.2 Weight fraction composition of the initial mixture, TLL, pH value of each phase and partition coefficient of TC at 25\u00b0C.\nTernary System\tWeight Fraction\t\t\t\t\t\n\tComposition (wt%)\t\tTLL (wt%)\tpHPEG-rich phase\tpHIL-rich phase\tktc\n\tPEG 600\tSalt\t\t\t\t\n\t54.94\t34.93\t115.65\t7.12\t7.09\t0.98\u00b10.03\n[Ch]Cl\t54.93\t29.98\t95.93\t7.05\t6.72\t0.92\u00b10.03\n\t54.91\t24.95\t57.58\t7.03\t6.81\t1.02\u00b10.04\n\t49.88\t34.93\t117.85\t11.22\t10.65\t10.07\u00b11.01\n[Ch]Bic\t49.81\t29.96\t102.38\t10.93\t10.55\t6.72\u00b10.62\n\t49.87\t24.99\t73.18\t10.83\t10.51\t5.68\u00b10.96\n\t45.00\t39.92\t81.48\t5.29\t5.25\t1.45\u00b10.17\n[Ch]DHcit\t45.85\t37.80\t67.52\t5.27\t5.03\t1.30\u00b10.06\n\t56.89\t29.94\t95.57\t5.39\t5.44\t1.14\u00b10.05\n\t49.75\t39.82\t123.64\t10.12\t10.06\t2.69\u00b10.27\n[Ch]Ac\t49.55\t34.77\t109.67\t9.44\t9.35\t2.73\u00b10.40\n\t49.59\t29.81\t95.84\t8.93\t8.90\t2.57\u00b10.21\n\t49.90\t29.95\t111.00\t7.65\t7.37\t2.69\u00b10.43\n[Ch]DHph\t40.20\t29.91\t96.19\t6.16\t5.97\t2.62\u00b10.15\n\t34.98\t29.97\t86.35\t6.56\t5.75\t2.60\u00b10.19\nIt should be remarked that for the systems based on [Ch]Bic, [Ch]DHcit and [Ch]DHph, the bottom phase is the salt-rich phase whereas the top phase corresponds to the PEGrich phase. However, some inversions on the phases' densities were observed depending on the composition and constituents of the system. Particularly, an inversion on the top and bottom phases was observed with the systems composed of [Ch]Cl and [Ch]Ac. Since both phases are liquid and non-colored, the coexisting phases were identified by conductivity measurements at 25\u00b0C (the conductivity values are provided in Supporting Information, Table S15.3).\nThis first optimization step aimed at understanding the dependence of KTC with the cholinium-based salt and respective TLLs. The values of KTC shown in Table 15.2 suggest that, in most cases, the antibiotic preferentially migrates for the PEG-rich phase. Only one exception was observed with the system composed of [Ch]Cl. In this system the KTC value is always close to unity indicating that TC distributes equally by the two phases. Moreover, the pH values of the phases, which range between 5 and 11, seem to have no significant influence concerning the preferential migration of the antibiotic for\nthe polymer-rich phase. Albeit tetracycline has preference for more hydrophilic phases, as displayed by its octanol-water partition coefficient (log Kow= -1.19)9, 10, in this study, tetracycline migrates preferentially for the most hydrophobic and polymeric phase. Therefore, this migration pattern could be a consequence of the salting-out effect of the cholinium-based salts over the antibiotic which forces its migration towards the PEGrich phase.\nTo facilitate the comparison between the cholinium-salt effect and the composition of the system through the partitioning of TC, the logarithmic function of KTC as a function of the TLL is depicted in Figure 15.1.\nFigure 15.1 Logarithm of KTC versus TLL, at 25\u00b0C, for the systems composed of PEG 600 + [Ch]-based salt + water: (\u2666) [Ch]Bic; (\u25a0) [Ch]Ac; (\u2022) [Ch]DHph; (\u2022) [Ch]DHcit; (\u25b2) [Ch]Cl.\nAn increase in the amount of the [Ch]-based salt or an increase in the polymer content lead to an increase in the TLL, i.e. to a higher difference in the composition of the coexisting phases of a particular system. According to Figure 15.1, the most relevant effect of the TLL is observed with the system constituted by [Ch]Bic where an increase in the TLL leads to an increase in the KTC value. In the remaining ABS the KTC values are approximately constant, taking into account the associated standard deviations, and independent of the TLL (in the composition range evaluated).\nAt a similar TLL, when comparing the different cholinium-based salts, the TC tends to migrate for the PEG-rich phase according to the following tendency: [Ch]Cl &lt;[Ch]DHcit &lt;[Ch]DHph ~ [Ch]Ac &lt;[Ch]Bic. Besides the preferential migration for the PEG-rich phase in most cases, there are differences between the diverse cholinium-based salts which depend on the pH values of the phases.\nTCs are amphoteric compounds and show three dissociation constants or pKa values: 3.30, 7.68 and 9.6911. Thus, in aqueous solutions of different pH, TCs can appear in one of the three forms: cationic when pH &lt;pKai (3.30), zwitterionic when pKai (3.30) &lt;pH &lt;pKa2 (7.68) and anionic when pH > pKa2 (7.68). The anionic species can be monovalent or divalent when the pH is between the pKa2 and the pKa3 (9.68) or when the\n12\npH > pKa3, respectively . The dissociation curves of TC as a function of the pH are shown in Supporting Information, Figure S15.5. Looking at the data in Table 15.2 it can be gauged that in the systems with [Ch]Cl, [Ch]DHcit and [Ch]DHph, TC is mainly in a neutral form (3.30 &lt;pH &lt;7.68); in the ABS composed of [Ch]Ac and [Ch]Bic, with pH values above the pKa2 of TC, the antibiotic is in a charged form (anionic); for the systems with 50 wt% of PEG 600 and 40 wt% of [Ch]Ac and all the PEG 600/[Ch]Bic ABS the pH values are above the pKa3 (9.68) of TC and in these cases TC is present as a divalent anion.\nIn the PEG/[Ch]Cl ABS there was no preferential affinity of TC for a given phase. This behavior is in close agreement with the weak ability of the chloride anion to induce the salting-out of other species13, 14 Indeed, in a previous work2 where a series of cholinium-based salts was evaluated, it was observed that [Ch]Cl was the compound with the weakest ability to form two liquid phases. In addition, in the [Ch]Cl systems with pH values around 7, TC is mainly in its neutral form (with only a small fraction being negatively charged) and has no preference for the highly charged salt-rich phase. When [Ch]DHcit is used to promote the TC partitioning, the antibiotic shows a slight affinity for the polymeric phase. In the [Ch]DHcit system, with pH values between 5 and 6, TC is mainly in its neutral form although some small fraction of positively charged TC is also present. Even though the citrate anion is usually considered a good salting-out agent, according to the Hofmeister series13, 14, the observed biomolecule partitioning for the PEG-rich is not significant possibly due to dissociation effects of the citrate anion. At a pH value around 6 the citrate anion is also dissociated in a divalent species as discussed before by Pereira et al3.\nFollowing the study of different anions in the cholinium-based salts, similar KTC for the PEG 600/[Ch]DHph and PEG 600/[Ch]Ac systems were identified. For the system with [Ch]DHph the antibiotic partitioning for the polymer-rich phase can be a direct consequence of the strong salting-out ability of the salt. On other hand, in the [Ch]Ac-based ABS, despite acetate anion having a lower ability to promote the salting-out of solutes when compared with the other salts, the alkaline pH of both phases seems to favorably induce the partitioning of TC for the PEG-rich phase. This trend is in accordance with the data obtained with the [Ch]Bic-based system where the highest partition coefficients were observed.\nSince it was observed that the pH is a relevant feature in the TC partitioning, it was also studied the effect of the pH change within a system. As observed with the systems constituted by PEG 600 and [Ch]Ac or [Ch]Bic the presence of TC in its anionic form leads to higher KTC values. Thus, the effect of increasing the pH value was further studied in the PEG 600/[Ch]Cl system. Here a change of the pH with addition of 0.5 wt% of NaOH from 7 to 12 was achieved. This change leads to an increase in the partition coefficient of tetracycline from 0.98 \u00b1 0.03 to 3.69 \u00b1 0.32 attesting the importance of the pH on the partition of TC on the studied systems.\nIn summary, the optimization tests using the commercial TC indicate that improved partition coefficients are obtained with ABS composed of [Ch]Bic. Therefore, this cholinium-based salt was chosen, along with the [Ch]Cl salt, to conduct the extractions from the fermented broth described below.\n15.4.2.\tPartitioning of TC in Conventional PEG/Na2SO4 and [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 ABS\nABS composed of PEG 600, [Ch]-based-salts and water are very recent3. Most of the studies previously published have been dealing with conventional ABS. Hence, two polymer/salt and salt/salt ABS were also studied in the TC extraction in order to compare with the performance of the systems here studied. Two ABS composed of PEG 600 and Na2SO4, and K3PO4 and [Ch]Cl were also investigated. All assays were prepared in triplicate and the respective weight fraction compositions, KTC, TLL, and the pH of the coexisting phases are presented in Table 15.3. For the PEG600/Na2SO4 aqueous system, KTC is the ratio between the TC concentration in the polymer-rich\nphase to that in the salt-rich phase whereas for the [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 ABS it is the TC concentration ratio between the [Ch]Cl- and K3PO4-rich phases.\nTable 15.3 Weight fraction composition of the initial mixture, TLL, pH value of each phase and partition coefficient of TC at 25\u00b0C in the conventional systems.\nWeight Fraction Composition (wt%)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nK3PO4\t[Ch]Cl\tPEG 600\tNaiSO4\tTLL (wt%)\tpHtopphase\tpHbottomphase\tktc\n-\t-\t40.04\t7.48\t59.22\t6.18\t5.30\t16.61\u00b10.12\n-\t-\t40.02\t10.01\t65.11\t6.25\t6.08\t13.00\u00b11.08\n35.02\t20.04\t-\t-\t71.97\t14.16\t13.66\t30.05\u00b11.40\n29.97\t20.08\t-\t-\t52.67\t13.65\t13.49\t28.75\u00b16.51\n27.51\t20.10\t-\t-\t35.46\t13.51\t13.39\t22.82\u00b12.21\nFrom the pH values displayed in Table 15.3, it can be anticipated that TC is in different forms in the two conventional ABS: in the PEG 600/Na2SO4 system, TC is mainly in its neutral form (5.30 &lt;pH &lt;6.25) whereas in the [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 system it is completely deprotonated (pH of the phases > pKa3). In the polymer/salt system TC is recovered in the top phase (PEG-rich phase) with KTC values higher than 13. In the [Ch]Cl-K3PO4 system the antibiotic preferentially migrates for the [Ch]Cl-rich phase (with KTC > 22). Both examples suggest that, independently of the pH, the salt used or the salting-out species employed has a major influence on the partitioning of tetracycline. In the PEGsalt systems it is clear that Na2SO4, being a stronger salting-out agent than the cholinium-based salts, enhances the partitioning of TC for the polymer-rich phase. On the other hand, when an inorganic salt is used in combination with [Ch]Cl, TC migrates for the [Ch]Cl-rich phase - a consequence of the strong K3PO4 salting-out aptitude13, 14 In summary, the choice of the main constituents of the ABS has a crucial impact in the preferential partitioning of TC. Indeed, according to these results, TC can be recovered in the polymer- or in the cholinium-rich phase depending on the second species added to the medium. Considering that in the PEG/[Ch]Cl ABS at an alkaline pH the TC partitions for the polymeric phase and that in the [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 system TC migrates for the [Ch]Cl-rich phase, these two systems can be used sequentially to carry out the back extraction of the antibiotic. Some experiments regarding back extraction procedures were conducted and the results are presented in Supporting Information, Figure S15.6.\nThe behavior observed with the PEG/Na2SO4 system is in close agreement with literature data for other biomolecules such as L-trypthophan, which tends to partition for\nthe polymer-rich phase in the presence of inorganic salts6. Recently, Shahriari et al.2 have also applied more hydrophobic cholinium-based salts and K3PO4 ABS to separate three antibiotics forms, and among them, TC. The results provided by the authors2 showed that the salting-out effect exerted by the phosphate anion is a dominant effect in the partitioning phenomenon.\nIn summary, although the polymer/cholinium-based ABS here studied exhibit lower TC extraction capabilities as compared with PEG/Na2SO4 and [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 systems, it should be remarked that both the cholinium-based salts and PEG are biocompatible and biodegradable highlighting and supporting their applicability in a fermentation broth to recover an antibiotic for human consumption.\n15.4.3.\tRecovery of TC from the Fermented Broth\nBased on the previous results, the PEG 600/[Ch]Cl and PEG 600/[Ch]Bic ABS were selected for the studies on the extraction of TC from the fermented broth of S. aureofaciens. The conventional PEG/Na2SO4 and [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 systems were also considered for comparison purposes. All these systems were studied as a prepurification step capable of concentrating the antibiotic in one aqueous-rich phase while the contaminants would be retained in the other phase. The corresponding systems (at the same concentrations presented in Tables 15.2 and 15.3 with the model systems) were prepared in triplicate, and the values of KTC and respective standard deviations, extraction efficiencies (%EETC), and pH values of the coexisting phases are presented in Table 15.4.\nTable 15.4 pH value of each phase, %EETC and partition coefficient of TC from the fermented broth at 25\u00b0C.\nSystem\tktc\t0%EEtc\tpHtopphase\tpHbottomphase\nPEG600/[Ch]Cl\t0.21 \u00b1 0.03\t81.63 \u00b1 5.26\t5.03\t4.43\nPEG600/[Ch]Bic\t3.98 \u00b1 0.41\t82.54 \u00b1 11.03\t9.31\t9.48\n[PEG600]/Na2SO4\t17.78 \u00b1 1.25\t54.67 \u00b1 6.55\t4.86\t4.66\n[Ch]Cl/K3PO4\t45.95 \u00b1 1.66\t92.42 \u00b1 2.84\t13.92\t13.71\nThe results obtained are compared in Figure 15.2 where the logarithmic function of KTC and the %EETC are presented.\nFigure 15.2 Logarithm of KTC (|) and \u00b0%EETC (-\u2022-) obtained in several ABS formed with the fermented broth.\nThe comparison of the KTC values obtained from the fermented broth (Figure 15.2 and Table 15.4) and with the model systems (Table 15.3) shows that the ABS formed by PEG and cholinium-based salts can be applied in real extraction routes. As expected some deviations were observed when compared with the results obtained from the model systems. For the [Ch]Bic-based ABS it was observed a decrease in the KTC values when applying the system directly to the fermented broth (from 10.07 with the commercial TC to 3.98 in the real system). This behavior can be explained by the complexity of the fermented broth that either interferes with the partitioning of TC or changes the pH of the medium. In the real system with [Ch]Bic it was observed a decrease in the pH (from 11.22 to 9.48) which, as previously discussed, changes the TC speciation. On other hand, an interesting result was observed with the PEG/[Ch]Cl system, where the TC was majorly concentrated in cholinium-rich phase (log KTC &lt;0) -an inverse trend to that observed with the model systems. This inversion of the TC partitioning can be a result of both the system acidification or due to the presence of residuals salts from the fermented medium.\nWith the conventional systems, namely with the PEG 600 + Na2SO4 ABS, it was also observed a lower extraction efficiency. In fact, the extraction efficiency is even lower than that observed for the PEG-cholinium-based ABS. However, with the\n[Ch]Cl/K3PO4 system almost all TC migrates for the cholinium rich-phase with extraction efficiencies higher than 92 %. With this system it is verified an intensification of the partitioning behavior as observed in other works using IL/salt ABS with complex matrices15.\nAlthough the [Ch]Cl/K3PO4 ABS presents the highest ability to extract TC it should be remarked that other advantages are inherent to ABS composed of cholinium-based salts and PEG. First of all, the ABS composed of PEG and cholinium-based salts are biocompatible and biodegradable and avoid the use of inorganic salts of high ionic strength. Moreover, depending on the salt employed, the extraction of TC can be tailored either for the PEG- or salt-rich phases and with single step extraction efficiencies higher than 80 %. The combination of several PEG-cholinium-based systems can be used as back-extraction approaches for the recovery of TC. The extraction of TC to the polymer-rich phase can be envisaged as an economically viable pre-purification step to remove most part of the fermented broth contaminants, such as proteins, cell-debris and other amphiphilic impurities. This polymeric phase can be further applied in chromatography using fluidized beds processes. Albeit a search on literature data was carried out for comparison purposes, no results concerning the extraction of TC obtained from the Streptomyces aureofaciens fermented broth were found. Thus, this work represents a novel contribution regarding the definition of alternative strategies to perform the pre-concentration and pre-purification of TC directly from the fermentation broth.\n15.5.\tConclusions\nThe extraction of tetracycline using cheaper and biocompatible ABS as alternative liquid-liquid extraction platforms was evaluated. Both model systems using commercial tetracycline and systems employing the fermentation broth of S. aureofaciens were investigated. In general, the cholinium-based salt nature and the pH of the medium largely contribute to the differences observed with the TC partitioning. For the systems composed of PEG 600, cholinium-based salts and the fermented broth, extraction efficiencies of the antibiotic higher than 80% were achieved. Moreover, depending on the cholinium-based salt, the recovery either occurs at the polymer- or at the salt-rich phase. These novel results support a tailoring ability of the cholinium-based ABS which can be further combined and applied as back extraction routes.\n15.6.\tReferences\n1.\tFreire, M.G., Cl\u00e1udio, A.F.M., Ara\u00fajo,\tCoutinho, J.A.P., Marrucho, I.M.,\nCanongia Lopes, J.N., and Rebelo, L.P.N., Aqueous Biphasic Systems: A boost brought about by using ionic liquids.

Due to the novelty of the IL-PEG-based ABS investigated their phase diagrams and driving mechanisms behind the liquid-liquid demixing were initially addressed. As a first approach it was studied the influence of several ILs on the phase formation of conventional PEG/inorganic ABS. It was observed that the ILs can be used as adjuvants allowing the tailoring of the extraction of model biomolecules, namely L-tryptophan. After this initial study and foreseeing the use of novel ABS on the biotechnological field, the inorganic salt commonly employed were replaced by different ILs in order to form the novel PEG-IL-based ABS. The extensive study performed with several combinations of PEGs and ILs allowed to conclude that the two-phases formation can be tuned by the adequate selection of the ILs cations or anions. In addition, it was also demonstrated that the formation of ABS combining polymers and ILs is not dominated by the ability of the isolated species to be solvated by water; instead, the PEG-IL interactions play a crucial role. Despite these initial assumptions based on experimental data, a more extensive study was carried out with the determination of the complete ternary phase diagram of the system composed of PEG 1500 + [C4mim]Cl + H2O at 323.15 K and 333.15 K, and where molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also employed. It was observed that the miscibility of [C4mim]Cl/PEG systems results essentially from the H-bonding established between the Cl- and the -OH groups of PEG. The addition of water to the binary PEG-IL system removes the IL from the vicinity of the PEG weakening thus their interactions which further leads to the liquid-liquid demixing - \u201cwashing-out\u201d phenomenon.\nThe main goal of the second part of this thesis concerns the use of the novel ABS for the extraction of biomolecules, in particular antibiotics from aqueous solutions. Then, before the direct use of these systems in more complex media, it was initially proved that these new ABS can enlarge the hydrophobic-hydrophilic range provided by conventional polymer/salt and polymer/polymer ABS. To elucidate this trend it was investigated the liquid-liquid partitioning behavior of three dyes used as molecular probes of different hydrophobicities. The results showed that the IL-PEG-based ABS exhibit a much wider hydrophilic-hydrophobic range than conventional systems reported to date. In fact, the phases' polarities can be properly tuned by an appropriate 277\nchoice of the IL chemical structure creating thus a new set of effective ABS to be applied in the biotechnological field. After the evaluation the enhancement of polarities range obtained with these new polymer/IL ABS, it was then tested the ability of the polymer-IL-based ABS for the extraction of three alkaloids of different polarity. It was demonstrated that these systems allow the selective separation of similar compounds by an adequate manipulation of the IL chemical structure and temperature of equilibrium.\nMost the ILs previously studied as phase forming components of PEG-IL-based ABS, although of low toxicity, present, however, lower biocompatibility and biodegradability. Thus, having in mind the extraction of antibiotics directly from a fermented broth, the two last chapters of this thesis were focused on the study of a new class of ABS composed of polymers and cholinium-based ILs. It was observed that several cholinium-based ILs are able to promote the phase separation with PEG in aqueous media, being this phenomenon mainly controlled by the PEG-IL specific interactions. Hereafter, it was firstly investigated the extraction of high purity and commercial tetracycline using these PEG-cholinium-based ABS in order to optimize the partitioning conditions. The enhanced PEG-cholinium-based systems identified were then used to recover tetracycline directly from the fermented broth of Streptomyces aurofaciens. The results obtained showed that more than 80% of tetracycline can be recovered in a single step procedure. Moreover, the extractions can be tailored either for the PEG- or cholinium-rich phase. Summing up, the results obtained in this work support the applicability and effectiveness of biocompatible ABS in the extraction of antibiotics from complex matrices. In this context, these novel ABS can be envisaged as alternative processes which can be applied in pharmaceutical or biotechnological industries.\n16.2.\tFuture Work\nThe bioprocess described in the part B of this thesis addresses the applicability of PEG-IL-based ABS as a sustainable and alternative extraction technique to the extraction of antibiotics from complex matrices, namely from fermented broths. The studied ABS showed interesting properties to be applied not only to pharmaceutical compounds but also to a wider range of compounds. In addition, they also revealed a high potential to be applied in CCC techniques due to their tailoring ability. Besides all the studies carried out here, some additional investigations should be considered in order to further explore and take advantage of the systems here proposed:\n\u2022\tExtraction of other antibiotics produced from microorganisms, such as clavulanic acid or durhamycin;\n\u2022\tApplication of the PEG-IL-based ABS in CCC techniques;\n\u2022\tOptimization of the back-extraction methods for the recovery of the antibiotics from the aqueous phases;\n\u2022\tStudies on the possible recycling of the phase forming components of ABS;\n\u2022\tCombination of ILs and polymers that revealed to be completely miscible to improve the solubility of pharmaceutical compounds in aqueous media.\n280\n17.

8\nS11.1\tDFT calculations\nThe hybrid meta GGA density functional calculations were performed with the M06 approach1 as implemented in the Gaussian 09 code2. The atomic electronic densities were described by means of the aug-cc-pVDZ basis set3, 4, which incorporates diffuse and polarization functions. Due to the large number of conformational degrees of freedom of TGA, the calculations involving this species followed the computational strategy below: Ten different initial configurations for TGA were taken from the classical MD simulations and then fully optimized at the DFT level using tight criteria (opt=tight and scf=tight keywords in the Gaussian code) but employing a basis set without diffuse functions. Some of the most favorable configurations, were further modified and were also fully optimized. The most favorable configurations retrieved from the previous steps were reoptimized with the larger aug-cc-pVDZ basis set. In the case of the different sized water clusters, the calculations were directly performed on the geometries available at The Cambridge Cluster Database5, while the calculations on the chloride-water clusters were based on the geometries reported by Xantheas6, by Gora et al.7 and by Neogi and\no\nChaudhury . The absence of imaginary vibrational frequencies (M06/aug-cc-pVDZ level of theory) was used to confirm that all the molecular systems studied were true minima on the potential energy surface\nTable S11.1.

A mixture in the biphasic region was prepared, vigorously stirred and allowed to reach equilibrium by the separation of both phases, for 12 h at 298 K using glass tubes (ca. 10 mL). After the equilibration time, the top and bottom phases were carefully separated, recovered and weighed. Each TL was determined by the lever-arm rule according to the relationship between the weight of the PEG-rich phase composition and the overall system composition. For that purpose the experimental\n12\nbinodal curves were firstly correlated using Equation S14.1.\n[peg] = Ax exp B x[il]0'5 - C x[il]3 )\tEquation S14.1\nwhere A, B and C are the correlation constants, and [IL] and [PEG] are the weight fractions percentages of ionic liquid and PEG, respectively. The tie-line lengths (TLLs) were determined according to standard protocols found in literature.13, 14 All the initial mixture compositions and respective TLs and TLLs are reported in Table S13.\n514.2.\tConductivity Measurements\nAfter the phase separation, conductivity (\u00b1 0.01 mS.cm-1) of both the IL-rich and PEGrich phases were measured at 298 K (\u00b1 1 K) using a
