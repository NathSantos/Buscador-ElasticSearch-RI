Intense cyclonic weather systems in southern Brazil generate ocean storms which can, \nin a temporal scale varying from few hours to a day completely erode a beach profile from its \nmaximum accretion state. Mid-latitude cyclogenesis with low pressure centers in the deep ocean \nand along the coast increases the intensity of the Mid-Atlantic storms causing storm surges and \nstorm waves. Preliminary results from a hindcast of wave energy at deep water (100 m), \nperformed with a wave model using winds from reanalysis ( period 1979 - 2008), indicated a total \nof 40 extreme events (wave height above 6 m). These events cause maximum erosion and surge \nelevation on the order of 62.96m\u00b3/m and 1.827 m respectively. Four patterns of synoptic situations \ncapable of generating extreme events were identified. Among the 40 events, 53.66% had the \ntrajectory of Pattern II and 26.82% were associated to Pattern III, representing both 80% of the \ntotal. Coastal erosion episodes where mostly associated with Pattern II, while Pattern III caused \nthe highest surges. In a climate change scenario this study shows no important differences in the \namount of the extreme events along the last thirty years. \n \nKey words: storm surge, extra-tropical cyclones, wave height, NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis \n \nResumo.

Generally, erosion is \n\ncaused by extreme sea state events which combine \nhigh waves and high storm surges. Since \nastronomical tides have higher amplitude in this \nregion during April, and the storms can last a few \n\n\n\nA. A. MACHADO ET ALLI \n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2010), 5(2): 105-114 \n\n106\n\ndays, it is not uncommon that episodes of severe \nerosion occur during the high water spring tide \nperiod (Calliari et al. 1998). These storms are mostly \nassociated with high intensity extra-tropical cyclones \nthat generate wind waves which can change a beach \nprofile from its maximum accretion state to \ncomplete erosion during a period that can vary from \nfew hours to a few days. \n\nRegarding the occurrence of extra-tropical \nCyclones in South America, Gan (1992), analyzing \n10 years of data (from 1979 to 1988) has found that \nthe majority of events happen in winter (8 events), \nfollowed by autumn (6), spring (4) and summer (3). \nGan &amp; Rao (1991) identified two cyclogenesis \nregions in South America: one in Argentina (42.5\u00b0 S \nand 62.5\u00b0 W) related to the baroclinic instability of \nthe westerly winds and another in Uruguay (31.5\u00b0 S \nand 55\u00b0 W) associated with the baroclinic instability \ndue to the presence of the Andes. Recently, a third \nregion between 20\u00b0 and in the 35\u00b0S located in \nsouthern and south-eastern Brazil was identified \n(Reboita et al. 2010). \n\nMid-latitude cyclogenesis with low pressure \ncenters in the deep ocean and along the coast \nincreases the intensity of Mid-Atlantic storms \ncausing extreme storm surges and storm waves \n(Calliari et al. 1998). The \u201csurge\u201d in a specific \ninstant is represented by the difference between the \nobserved and the astronomical tide and can be either \npositive or negative causing rapid increase or \ndecrease in sea level, respectively (Pugh 1987). \n\nStorm surges are the major geological risk in \nlow coastal areas. They are often associated with \nsignificant losses of life and property. Climate \nchange, with rising sea level and changing storm \ntracks, will modify the regional distributions of these \nhazards (von Storch &amp; Woth 2008). \n\nThe two main sources of storm surges are: \nchanges in atmospheric pressure and the exchange of \nmomentum between the wind and the sea surface. In \ngeneral, the effects associated with atmospheric \npressure is less than 10% of the total, being the wind \nshear stress at the sea surface the main component \n(Marone &amp; Camargo1994). Additionally, sea level \nelevations at the shore can be further amplified by \nthe presence of shelf waves and by the pilling up of \nwater due to wave breaking processes at the surf \nzone (known as \u201cwave set up\u201d) (Marone &amp; Camargo \n1994). \n\nObservations of synoptic weather conditions \nand sea level elevation done by Parise et al. (2009) \nshowed that the highest sea level elevation events \nresulted from the action of SW winds which blow \nparallel to the main NE-SW coastline orientation in \nthe region, a result that can be explained by the \n\npilling up of water at the coast due to the Coriolis \neffect (i.e. Ekman transport). The monitoring carried \nout by Saraiva et al. (2003) from April 1997 to July \n1999 on Cassino Beach indicated the highest \nfrequency of the storm surge in autumn (65%), \nfollowed by similar values in summer and spring \n(15%) and lower values in winter (5%). All the \nstorm surges observed by Saraiva et al. (2003) were \nassociated with extra-tropical cyclones. \n\nCoastal erosion has been causing substantial \nalterations along the coastline of the Rio Grande do \nSul (RS) state in southern Brazil for quite some \ntime. In the less occupied areas in the central littoral, \ncoastal erosion caused habitat loss of foredune \nridges and inflicted local damage to a lighthouse \n(Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse) and small beach resorts at \nLagamarzinho beach (Barletta &amp; Calliari 2003). In \nmore developed regions of the northern littoral, such \nas Cidreira, Tramanda\u00ed and Imb\u00e9 beaches, coastal \nerosion is aggravating, leading to severe loss of \npublic and private property (Esteves et al. 2000, \nToldo Jr. et al. 1993). At the southern littoral, \nHermenegildo beach, located near the Uruguayan \nborder, has had homes, roads and power lines \nsystematically destroyed (Calliari et al. 1998, \nEsteves et al. 2000). Additionally, in several \nstretches of the RS coastline, beach erosion causes \nexposure of peat and muddy lagoonal outcrops \nleading to a decrease in the quality of beach \nrecreation (Calliari et al. 1998) (Fig. 1). \n\nIn a climate change scenario, the present \nstudy aims at assessing in detail the synoptic \nsituations that give rise to extreme sea state events in \nSouthern Brazil and determining trends in the \natmospheric patterns and path lines of \nmeteorological systems associated with them. The \nerosional impact on the coastline and the storm \nsurges caused by these extreme events are also \ninvestigated. Case studies of selected extreme events \nthat generated strong beach erosion are also \ndiscussed in detail. \n \nMaterials and Methods \nExtreme events \n\nIn the absence of sufficiently long data sets, \nwe had to resort to numerical models to infer the \noccurrence of extreme events. The results used \nherein were extracted from a comprehensive study \nthat is being currently carried out by the third author \nand are still preliminary (see Melo et al. 2010). In \nthat on-going study, the wave generation model \nWave Watch III (WW3) (Tolman 2002) forced with \nreanalysis winds from NCEP (National Centers for \nEnvironmental Prediction) was used to reconstruct \nsea state conditions off the southern Brazilian coast  \n\n\n\nExtreme coastal sea state conditions in southern Brazil \n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2010), 5(2): 105-104 \n\n107\n\n \nFigure 1. Study area and location of cited sites. \n \nfrom 1979 to 2008. \u201cExtreme\u201d events were then \nselected based on the criteria that the reconstructed \nsignificant wave height (Hs) at a point in 100 m \ndepth off Rio Grande city exceeded the 6 m mark. \nPreliminary results indicated that a total of 40 \nextreme events occurred in the studied period. \n\n \nSynoptic scenarios associated with extreme events \n\nThe reanalysis dataset was created through \nthe cooperative efforts of the NCEP and NCAR \n(National Center for Atmospheric Research) (Kalnay \net al. 1996) to produce relatively high-resolution \nglobal analyses of atmospheric fields over a long \ntime period. The reanalysis dataset (R-1 of NCEP / \nNCAR) was used to characterize atmospheric \nconditions that originated these 40 extreme events. \n\nTo do so, meridional and zonal components of the \nwind and atmospheric pressure at the 995 mbar level \nwere used. For both a spatial resolution of 2.5\u00b0 x \n2.5\u00b0, and a temporal resolution of 6 hours (0000, \n0600, 1200, 1800 UTC) restricted between 60\u00b0S - \n15\u00b0S and 90\u00b0W - 20\u00b0W was adopted. In order to \nbetter characterize the path of the systems that \ngenerated extreme events, a threshold vorticity lesser \nor equal than (?10) -5 x 10-5s-1 was adopted. The \nreanalysis dataset is available at site \nwww.cdc.noaa.gov \n\n \nData analysis \n\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to \nverify differences between the numbers of events at \n3 years interval along the 30 years.

(2005) found an increase in \nthe number of tropical cyclones and cyclone days as \nwell as tropical cyclone intensity over the past 35 \nyears, in an environment of increasing sea surface \ntemperature. A large increase was seen in the \nnumber and proportion of hurricanes reaching \ncategories 4 and 5. The largest increase occurred in \nthe North Pacific, Indian, and Southwest Pacific \nOceans, and the smallest occurred in the North \nAtlantic Ocean. \n\nFrom the analysis of the meteorological \nscenarios, four patterns of synoptic situations \ncapable of generating extreme events were identified \n(Fig. 3): \n\u2022 PATTERN I: Cyclogenesis in the southern \nArgentinean coast with a displacement to the east \nand a trajectory between 47.5\u00b0S and 57.5\u00b0S; \n\u2022 PATTERN II: Cyclogenesis in the southern \nUruguayan coast with a displacement to the east and \na trajectory between 28\u00baS and 43\u00b0S; \n\u2022 PATTERN III: Cyclogenesis in the southern \nUruguayan coast with a displacement to the \nsoutheast and a trajectory between 32\u00b0S and 57.5\u00b0S; \n\u2022 PATTERN IV: High-pressure center generating \nan easterly wind. \n \n\nWas not observed at the study area a \nsignificant difference in the frequency of the  \npatterns of cyclone trajectories along time. The \npattern with the greatest number of extreme events \nwas Pattern II with 22 of the 40 +1 events. Eleven \n(11) events were associated with Pattern III and four \n(4) events were associated to both Pattern I and IV. \nThe value of 41 related to the sum of all the patterns \nis due to an event that occurred on 07/21/1996, in \nwhich, two parallel extra-tropical cyclones \nresembling Patterns I and II occurred simulta-\nneously. \n\n \nCase Studies \n\nIn this section, a selection of extreme sea \nstate events was used to assess both, the specific \nmeteorological scenarios associated, and the \nresponse that was observed on the coast in terms of \nbeach erosion. \n\n \nJuly 21th, 1996 \n\nAn extreme wave height event occurred on \nJuly 21th, 1996. The meteorological scenario shows \ntwo extra-tropical cyclones parallel to each other \nrepresenting Patterns I and II. Due to its eastern path \nand the following of a high pressure system in the \nrear, a long southwest wind fetch of more than 3000 \nkm was formed over the Atlantic off the South \nAmerican coast (Fig. 4). \n\n\n\nExtreme coastal sea state conditions in southern Brazil \n\nPan-American Journal of Aquatic Sciences (2010), 5(2): 105-104 \n\n109\n\nThis event caused the maximum erosion \nprofiles recorded in 1996. At places located between \nSolid\u00e3o and Estreito lighthouses the maximum \neroded volume reached 62.96 m\u00b3/m (Barletta &amp; \nCalliari 2003) (Fig. 5). \n \nApril 18th, 1999 \n\nThe meteorological scenario on this extreme \nevent was unusual since the path of the cyclone that \ndeveloped off the RS coast formed a loop without \nmuch forward motion (Fig. 6). \n\nSevere erosion was observed at Hermene- \n \n\ngildo beach. Prior to the storm, this beach resort had \n110 beachfront houses. During the storm, 22 houses \nwere destroyed or highly damaged. This single \nstorm was also able to destroy the majority of \ncoastal protection structures including 20% of all \nbeachfront houses. However, as it was later \nobserved, all the coastal protection structures were \nbuilt on top of the foredunes without any foundation \nunderneath them, being, in this way, susceptible to \nundermining. Esteves et al. (2000) indicated that this \nwas the process that caused most of the structures to \ncollapse (Fig. 7). \n\n \nFigure 3.

Modified from Barletta &amp; Calliari (2003). \n\n \nMay 25th, 2003 \n\nThis event was, actually, monitored by an \noceanographic buoy moored offshore Rio Grande \ncity (Minuano buoy from the PNBOIA, Program \nmoored at a depth of 70 m) since it caused mud \ndeposition at Cassino beach (Calliari &amp; Faria 2003). \nBuoy measurements, which did not include \ndirection, are displayed in Table I. Maximum \nsignificant wave height came very close to the 7 m \nmark. The path described by the extra-tropical \ncyclone on this event resembled Pattern II (Figure \n8A). A large low pressure center can be observed \nmoving slowly towards the E (Fig. 8B). \n \nSeptember 04th, 2006 \n\nThis event coincided with one of the extra-\ntropical cyclones studied by Parise et al. (2009), \nwho shows that this particular storm caused a surge \nof 1.827 m. Although the surge was very high, beach \nerosion was low (-8.14 m3/m) the reason being that \n\nthe initial profile was already eroded by the winter \nstorms. Regarding the meteorological scenario, it \ncan be observed the development of a long wind \nfetch from S to SW (Fig. 9). The association \nbetween this wind pattern and the NE-SW \norientation of the shoreline favored the extra high \nrise in sea level observed on the coast due to the \nCoriolis effect (Parise et al. 2009). \n \nTable I.

Maximum values of storm surges of the order of \n1 m, 1.4 m and 1.9 m in the coast of the RS have \nbeen found by Calliari et al. (1998), Saraiva et al. \n(2003) and Parise et al. (2009), respectively. During \nthis event great part of Cassino beach was flooded \nwhen the water reached the first avenue close to the \nbeach. \n\nStudies done by Saraiva et al.

The mean number of events obtained was \n1.33 per year. To these events data of wind velocity \nand vorticity, atmospheric pressure and sea level \nelevation were added. Effects of extreme events on \n\nthe coast caused maximum erosion and surge \nelevation on the order of 62.96m\u00b3/m and 1.827 m, \nrespectively. \n\nAmong the 40 events studied, 22 (53.66%) \nhad the trajectory of Pattern II with Cyclogenesis to \nthe south of the Uruguayan coast with a path to the \neast and a trajectory between 28\u00b0S and 43\u00b0S. \nCyclones associated with Pattern III, represented \n26.82% (11 events). Those two types represent 80% \nof the total extreme events. The relationship between \nthe coastal erosion and these extreme events is clear, \nas observed from Parise et al. (2009), being the \ncyclones associated with Pattern II the most erosive \nones, whereas those associated with Pattern III the \nones that cause highest surges. \n\nThe reanalysis dataset of NCEP proved  \nvery useful in this type of analysis, because  \nalthough the spacing of the data 2.5 degrees, \ncyclones and anticyclones studied have diameters \nabove 1000 km, thus presenting a good answer  \nto the synoptic situation that caused each extreme \nevent studied. \n\n \nReferences \nBarletta, R.
