Their simple construction\nand operation, lack of moving parts and small floor space required are some advantages of this equipment.\nHowever, these reactors are associated with complex fluid dynamics due to the interaction between the gas and liquid phases. The hydrodynamic phenomena involved\ninclude the break-up and coalescence of bubbles, the transition between the flow regimes and the vortical structures dominating the liquid flow field in the bubble column. Based on the flow rate of the gas phase, two flow regimes can be distinguished: the homogeneous regime, which occurs at low speeds and is characterized by the uniform distribution of small bubbles and a relatively smooth mixing in the column; and the heterogeneous regime, where the gas flows quickly through the column, promoting vigorous mixing and the appearance of large clusters and bubbles (Hyndman et al. 1997). The study of bubble column behavior is very important, because it provides information essential for the effective design and operation, as well as the scale-up, of this type of equipment.\nIn this context, the numerical simulation of the gas-liquid flow using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an essential tool. There are currently considerable efforts being directed toward enabling the use of this tool for the design, scale-up and optimum operation of the BCR. Modeling and simulation of this equipment is hindered by the complex interaction between the phases, turbulence and high recirculation flow of the liquid phase inside the column.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the flow behavior of the gas and liquid phases present in a bubble column operating in homogeneous and heterogeneous regimes, using experimental and numerical techniques. The physical experiments were performed in an Experimental Unit of Bubble Column (EU-BC), changing the superficial velocity of the gas phase within a range of 0.05 and 0.10m s\u20191. The experimental results provide valuable data which could be used to validate the CFD model. The numerical study considered that the bubble column comprises three phases: liquid, \"small\" bubbles and \"large\" bubbles and an Eulerian description was applied to each of these phases.\nExperiments\nExperimental setup\nThe physical experiments were performed in a cylindrical column with dimensions of 0.1442m diameter and 0.87m height (H). The column wall is constructed of acrylic material, 0.3cm thick, allowing the visualization of the flow for the liquid velocity measurements. The column system operates with air and tap water, where the air enters the column through the perforations in the gas distributor plate, ascending through the top of the column. The ungassed liquid height was 0.6m.\nThe gas distributor, in the bottom of the column, is a dispersing plate which has a porous mesh area of 24.75cm2, perforation size of 130 10-3m and porosity of 20%. The inlet air flow is controlled by a Fisher needle valve (model 646) equipped with a pneumatic system for opening and closing, which is controlled by a gas flow-meter (Dweyer Instruments - model GMF 1142), limited to below 100 l min-1.\nThe temperature of the system and the pressure at two points were obtained, respectively, using a PT100 and a pressure transmitter, and the pressure difference was used to measure the gas holdup. All sensors are connected to a central data management system. This system receives the signals (4-20mA) from all sensors, converts them and sends this data to a computer, which records the data and controls the valve via a PID controller, ensuring that the gas is continuously fed at a desired set-point rate. The standard deviations of the gas flow for all experimental runs were around 0.01 l min-1.\nFigure 1 shows the experimental apparatus with the following components: (1) bubble column, (2) air distributor, (3 and 4) temperature sensors, (5) pressure sensor, (6) air flowmeter, (7) control valve, (8) compressed air, (9) on/off valve, (10) controlled gas flow, (11) central data management system, (12) management, acquisition and control system.\nFigure 1 - Bubble Column Experimental Unit iRuBC:.\nFigura 1 - Unidade Experimental da Coluna de Bolha (EU-BC).\nFigura 1 - Unidad Experimental de la Columna de Burbuja (EU-BC).\nTime-average gas holdup\nThe global gas holdup (s5) was determined from the hydrostatic pressure difference over two points through the following mathematical relation.\n(1)\nwhere Dh Dh is the distance from each measurement point, and d, P> R are the gravity constant, density and pressure, respectively. The subscripts 1 and d refer to the liquid and gas phases, respectively.\nTwo points were fixed, with a distance of 0.40m between them, one located close to the distributor, Ri (H=0 m), and the other, R2, at 0.40m height from the gas distributor. The data acquisition was carried out at an average of 10min intervals during the pressure measurements. The experiments were performed in triplicate and the average value considered.\nilluminated by laser light for a short time. A CCD camera with a resolution of 1392 x 1024 pixels was used to record the images of the flow. Two sequential images were captured, allowing the particle displacement to be measured. The time between images must permit a minimum particle displacement of 5 pixels. Due to the small size (and low Stokes number) of the tracer particles it can be considered that the particle velocity has the same value as the liquid velocity. The instantaneous velocity is determined. Two thousand pairs of images are captured at 4.7Hz which leads to 425s measured in each case. The measurement window covered the space between the heights of 0.46m and 0.54m above the gas distributor, and data were collected at 0.50m.\nThe mean liquid phase velocity H is determined as:\nN\nwhere N is the number of samples.\nTime-average liquid velocity\nTo determine the liquid phase velocity, the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique was used. Tracer particles made of modified carboxy-acrylate resin (average diameter of 15 10-3, density 1100kg m-3 and 2.10-5 Stokes number in water) were inserted into the liquid and\nNumerical formulation\nIn the formulation of the mathematical model it was assumed that both phases are described by continuum mechanics (physical and mathematical) and governed by partial differential equations. The phases are separated\nby an interface, at which the conservation of mass and momentum is expressed (Enwald et al. 1997). The direct solution of the system of equations can completely describe a multiphase flow, and this procedure is called direct numerical simulation (DNS). Due to the high number of bubbles and the turbulent characteristics of the system, the application of the DNS procedure is not successful on the required scale in time and space. However, this problem can be simplified by replacing a point variable by an average of variables in time or space. The result for this average, with the aid of the concept of the phase function (Drew, 1983), describes the motion of the multiphase flow (Sokolinchin and Eigenberger, 2004).\nAs a result of this treatment, the Eulerian-Eulerian approach presents an advantage. It does not require the solution of the dynamics at the interface of the phases (Sokolinchin and Eigenberger, 2004). However, the interface phenomena, such as heat, mass and momentum transfer, must be modeled using empirically-based equations.\nIn this study, an Eulerian description is used for each of the phases considered: liquid, \"small\" bubbles and \"large\" bubbles. It was considered that the gas phase interacts with the liquid phase but that the gas phase components (\"small\" and \"large\" bubbles) do not interact with each other. The same strategy was used by Krishna etal. (1999).\nNeglecting the mass transfer between the phases, the average continuity and momentum equation is given by:\n(3)\n-Q^JkPk 0+ \u2018(fkPk k k+fk k^}=\t(4)\n~fk v Pk +X'\u00a3j Fkj +Pk fk g\nwhere fK represents the volume fraction, pK and vK the macroscopic density and velocity vector for the Kth phase, respectively, p K the pressure field, having the same value for the gas and liquid phases,!?* the effective tensor, FKj\nthe momentum transfer between phases and g the gravity vector. The subscript K represents a generic phase.\nThe gas and liquid volume fractions and the momentum transfer between phases are related through the summation constraint:\n(5)\n27 t,=\t. \u25a0\t+\nwhere F** A*. and K7 are the drag, lift and virtual mass forces, respectively.\nClosure equations\nIn order to solve equations 3 and 4, additional equations are required, determined empirically or as postulates, relating the effective fluxes of momentum, T** , and interphase momentum transfer kJ\nEffective fluxes of momentum\nConsidering a Newtonian fluid and the eddy viscosity hypothesis, the effective fluxes can be written as:\nf=- fl k+( PT] (6)\nwhere the superscript T represents the transpose of the tensor and f 1 is the effective viscosity, expressed by:\nf= k+ k\t(7)\nwhere lik is the molecular viscosity and *4 is the additional viscosity due to the turbulence effects, which is predicted using a turbulence closure or turbulence model.\nInterphase momentum transfer\nThe interphase momentum transfer component describes the interaction between the phases at the interface. It contains the effects of the drag, size and formation of the boundary layer and uneven distribution of pressure along the discrete phase, which cause the lift and virtual mass forces. Due to the small effect required for the numerical results, the virtual mass force is neglected.\nThe drag force per unit volume for gas-liquid two-phase flow can be written as:\n= A ( - )\t(8)\nwhere the subscripts g and 1 represent the properties in the gas and liquid phases, respectively, pgl is the momentum transfer coefficient and is the projected bubble area in the flow direction per unit volume. For spherical bubbles\n-I and A =\u2014 -\nFor the \"large\" bubble phase Krishna and Ellenberger (1996) proposed the following correlation:\n= ( )()(') (11)\nwhere SF is the scale correction factor, in this case equal to 1, AF is the acceleration factor, db,large and AF are given by:\nwhere U is the gas superficial velocity, Ut\u2122s is gas superficial velocity at the transition between the homogeneous to heterogeneous regimes and g, 5, a and p are experimentally determined. Multiple regression shows:\ng = 0.069\t5 = 0.376 a = 2.73 p = 4.505\nThe lift force is given by:\n- = P (y T')x xV/\t(13)\nwhere db is the bubble diameter and cd is the drag coefficient. The drag coefficient was estimated using:\n(9)\nwhere Vbi is the bubble terminal velocity.\nFor the \"small\" bubble phase, the Vbi was estimated using the drag correlation of Harmathy (1960):\n(10)\nwhere cl is the non-dimensional lift coefficient. In this study, this coefficient is equal to 0.2, selected in the preliminary numerical analysis. The lift force is only considered in the \"small\" bubble phase.\nTurbulence equations\nThe standard k-e turbulence model can be used to represent the turbulence in the BCR. For the standard k-e model the turbulent viscosity is calculated as follows:\n(14\nwhere is the turbulent kinetic energy in the kth phase and is the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy in the kth phase. The conservation equation for turbulent kinetic energy and its dissipation rate can be written as:)\n{fkPkkk}-^-\nfk\u00cdPk~Pk\u00a3k),\n-^-{fkPk\u00a3k}~\\~\nV-{i[A\u00bba-(Mt+^)V\u00a3j}= jf-g-* 0.25cm (C,Pk-C2 pkck).\nk = 1, ... , np.\n(15)\nwith:\nA=i4 v vt, [v \\k+(v&lt;],\nwhere Cm, C1, C2, and se are the model constants.\nNumerical procedure\nThe Finite Volume method was applied on a generalized coordinated and collocated grid to solve the model. Transient simulations were carried out using the commercial CFD code ANSYS CFX 13.0, with a structured multi-block grid generated by the body fitted on a generalized and collocated grid. All simulations were carried out using axis-symmetry due to the large number of numerical experiments. The grid size was around 10,800 cells and details of the geometry, mesh and boundary conditions are given in figure 2.\nInitially, the column was filled with the liquid phase to the operating height of 0.6m, as in the physical experiment. Atmospheric pressure was imposed at the top of the column, with the non-slip condition for the liquid and free slip for the gas phase at the wall boundary condition. The gas phase is treated as a dispersed fluid where it is assumed that all the bubbles have the same diameter: that is, 5mm for small bubbles and for the large bubbles 4^ is calculated using equation 12.\nFigure 2 - Column geometry, mesh and boundary conditions.\nFigura 2 - Geometria de coluna, malhas e condi\u00e7\u00f5es de contorno.\nFigura 2 - Geometr\u00eda de columna, mallas y condiciones de contorno.\nThe gas phase enters in the column through a normal uniform-speed boundary, and the value is equal to those measured in the experiments. Operation at U &lt;Utrans represents the homogeneous regime, with the liquid and \"small\" bubble phases, and operation at U &lt;Ut\u2122s the complete three-phase regime. The volumetric flow for the \"small\" bubble phase at the column inlet is Ut\u2122s/U, and (U - Utrans)/U is the total incoming volumetric flow for the \"large\" bubble phase (Krishna et al. 1999). Table 1 shows the numerical boundary conditions.\nIn both cases, 30s of real time is simulated with a step time of 0.005s. The arithmetic mean is calculated from the results for the variables obtained during the stabilization of the column profiles and at each time step. The results were acquired at the same positions as in the case of the experimental data. Turbulence equations were used for the liquid phase only.\nA high-order interpolation scheme was used for the hydrodynamics equations and an upwind scheme for the turbulence equations. The pressure-velocity coupling was obtained using the SIMPLEC algorithm. The improved Rhie--Chow algorithm was used to calculate the velocity at the cell faces to avoid numerical problems like check-boarding and zigzag. The relaxation factors were not used. The time discretization was performed in a fully implicit first-order approximation.\nBoudary\tCondition\tfl\t/small\t/large\nInltet\tvgy = ^,vgz=0-, vix = 0, v/y = 0, v/z = 0; * = l,5(|vy|Z)2,e=^i.\t1 ~ {fsmall + /large')\tulmns U\t(U-U,rans) u\nOutlet\tdvSx _dvSy _dvgz dr]\tdr]\tdr] dv/x\tdv/y\t__ dviz\t_\t_&lt;/T|\tdr|\tdr]\t\u2019 dr] \u2014 dr\\\t\u2014 Kref- dvgx _dvgy _dvgz _ n dT]\tdT]\tdT]\tv\u2019\t0\tdfvnall _ A dn -u\t^=0\nWall\tvix = 0, viy = 0, v/z = 0 dk \t de \ta dr| ~ dr| _ u-\t\u25a0A\u2019P\u2019 II O\t\t\nSymmetry\tvkx = ^ = 0 dk _ de _ dP _ dt]\tdr)\tdr)\tdr|\tdfl -U\t\u201cST =0\t^=0\nOrthogonal wall direction, T] normal direction.

The experimental profiles shown in figure 3 present three main operational systems, and are typical for sintered plate distributors according to Deckwer (1992).\nThe homogeneous regime was observed for low gas phase velocities, where e has a tendency to increase linearly with increasing U. According to Kazakis etal. (2007), the transition regime is identified when there is a decrease in\nFigure 3 - Total gas holdup: experimental data.\nFigura 3 - Deslocamento total de g\u00e1s: dados experimentais.\nFigura 3 - Des-plazamiento total de gas: datos experimentales.\nthe profile slope. This can be seen in figure 3 in the range of 0.01787 to 0.03829m s\u20191. For values over 0.03829m s-1 the volume fraction still presents a tendency to increase, but the rate is lower than that observed in the homogeneous regime, indicating a fully developed heterogeneous regime.\nThe transition between the three regimes can be confirmed by visualization of the flow inside the bubble column (Piscke, 2011). Snapshots were taken of the bubble column in operation and are shown in figure 4. In the homogeneous regime there is a uniform distribution of small bubbles and a relatively smooth mix in the column. Above a superficial velocity of 0.01787m s-1 the transition regime starts, where it is possible to verify the coalescence phenomenon through the appearance of large bubbles. At a superficial velocity of over 0.03829m s-1 there is a fully developed heterogeneous regime, as shown in figure 4(d).\nThe passage of bubbles strongly modifies the velocity and the direction of liquid phase flow, causing velocity fluctuations. In this regard, the average liquid velocity is an interesting variable which provides useful design and operation information for scaled-up bubble column reactors. Figure 5 shows the mean axial liquid velocity profiles for a position at 0.5m above the gas distributor and for two U values in the homogeneous and also the transition regime. For U > 0.02808m s-1 it was not possible to obtain reliable data using PIV.\nFigure 4 - Snapshots of BCR in different operation regimes, where (a) homogeneous; (b) lower transition; (c) upper transition and (d) fully heterogeneous.\nFigura 4 - Fotos instant\u00e2neas do BCR em diferentes regimes de opera\u00e7\u00e3o, onde (a) homog\u00eaneo; (b) transi\u00e7\u00e3o mais baixa; (c) transi\u00e7\u00e3o superior e (d) completamente heterog\u00eaneas.\nFigura 4 - Fotos instant\u00e1neas del BCR en diferentes reg\u00edmenes de operaci\u00f3n, donde (a) homog\u00e9neo; (b) transici\u00f3n m\u00e1s baja; (c) transici\u00f3n superior y (d) completamente heterog\u00e9neas.\nFigure 5 - Mean liquid velocity: experimental data using PIV.\nFigura 5 - Velocidade m\u00e9dia do l\u00edquido: dados experimentais usando PIV.\nFigura 5 - Velocidad media del l\u00edquido: datos experimentales usando PIV.\nreproduced the trends in the global gas holdup with increasing gas velocity. For the homogeneous regime, when only the small bubble phase was considered, the numerical profile slope was less vertical than that for the experimental data. The numerical data for the transition between the homogeneous and heterogeneous regimes showed the same change in the slope profile observed for the experimental data. In the heterogeneous regime, where large bubbles occur, the numerical model showed good agreement with the experimental data and was able to predict experimental values.\nThe radial profile of the time-average axial liquid velocity has a parabolic shape, resulting in the traditional overall re-circulating flow with an up-flow at the center axis and down-flow close the wall. The profile for the homogeneous regime has a flattened parabolic form. On increasing the gas flow rate the parabolic shape is accentuated, showing greater magnitude for the upward and downward liquid velocities.\nNumerical results\nFigure 6 shows a comparison between the numerical and experimental data. It can be seen that the simulations\nFigure 6 - Total gas holdup: comparison between numerical and experimental data.\nFigura 6 - Deslocamento total de g\u00e1s: compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre dados num\u00e9ricos e experimentais.\nFigura 6 - Desplaza miento total de gas: comparaci\u00f3n entre datos num\u00e9ricos y experimentales.\nFigure 7 shows the numerical profile for the mean axial velocity at a position of 0.5m height from the column bottom for seven gas flow rates.\n0\t0.025\t0.05\t0.075\nr(m)\n0.00509ms\u2019J --------- 0.02808ms\u2019J\t......\n0.01020ms , ...... 0.03317ms\u2019 ..........\u25a0\n0.01276ms , ---------- 0.04849ms,\t\u2014\u2022\u2014\n0.01786ms\u20191 --------- 0.05871ms\u20191\t\u2014\u2022\u2014\nFigure 7 - Mean liquid velocity: numerical data.\nFigura 7 - Velocidade m\u00e9dia do l\u00edquido: dados num\u00e9ricos.\nFigura 7 - Velocidad media del l\u00edquido: datos num\u00e9ricos.\nIn this figure the effects of the gas flow in the numerical experiments can be observed. In general, increasing the gas flow rate increases the maximum velocity at the center of the column and increases the downward velocity in regions close to the wall. It is observed that under the homogeneous regime, the velocity profiles have a flatter parabolic shape. In this case, only the \"small\" bubble phase is considered.\nWhen the bubble column is operating in the transition and heterogeneous regimes a change in the velocity profiles can be noted and the parabolic profiles have a more inclined shape. A more pronounced parabolic profile can be observed. A central plateau is evident for the liquid phase velocity, where it remains approximately constant until the radial region g=0.018m. After this region, a sharp decline in the velocity toward the column wall occurs, thus the profile is quasi-linear, which is not so clearly observed for A' 0.01786m s\u20191.\nThis characteristic of the velocity profile is due to the presence of the \"large\" bubble phase in the column, which increases their volume fraction by increasing the superficial velocity of the total gas phase. Large bubbles rise and form clusters in the central regions of the column, these bubbles having a high velocity, leading to a greater liquid phase velocity in these regions due to the momentum transfer.\nFigure 8 shows the velocity profile for the bubble phase observed in the numerical analysis for all three regimes. It can be noted that for the small bubble phase the velocity profiles are more homogeneous along the radius of the column for all regimes, and for the large bubble phase a velocity peak is observed in the central region, with velocities being two to three times larger than those of the small bubble phase. Also, there is a sharp drop in the velocity in the regions close to the walls due to the low volume fraction of the large bubble phase present in this region, in agreement with the observations of the previous paragraph.\nFigure 8 - Mean bubble velocity: numerical data.\nFigura 8 - Velocidade m\u00e9dia da bolha: dados num\u00e9ricos.\nFigura 8 - Velocidad media de la burbuja: datos num\u00e9ricos.\nFigures 9 and 10 compare the measured profiles for the time-average axial velocities with the corresponding simulation results for a height of 0.5m.

It was observed that the liquid velocity phase is strongly affected by changes in the superficial velocity of the gas phase (U), and therefore the operational regime of the column.\nFigure 9 - Mean liquid velocity: comparison between numerical and experimental data for homogeneous regime.\nFigura 9 - Velocidade m\u00e9dia do l\u00edquido: compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre dados num\u00e9ricos e experimentais para o regime homog\u00eaneo.\nFigura 9 - Velocidad media del l\u00edquido: comparaci-\u00f3n entre datos num\u00e9ricos y experimentales para el r\u00e9gimen homog\u00e9neo.\nFigure 10 - Mean liquid velocity: comparison between numerical and experimental data for transition regime.\nFigura 10 - Velocidade m\u00e9dia do l\u00edquido: compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre dados num\u00e9ricos e experimentais para regime de transi\u00e7\u00e3o.\nFigura 10 - Velocidad media del l\u00edquido: compara-ci\u00f3n entre datos num\u00e9ricos y experimentales para r\u00e9gimen de transici\u00f3n.\nConclusions\nPressure data were acquired in a cylindrical laboratory-scale bubble column which allowed the determination of the transition between the operation regimes of the column.

The simulations are validated with experimental data for the global gas holdup and liquid-phase axial velocities. The time-averaged variables are well predicted as verified by comparison with the measured radial profiles of the mean values.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge PETROBRAS for financial support through the cooperation agreement 0050.0045548.08.4.\nRefer\u00eancias bibliogr\u00e1ficas\n\u25a0\tDECKWER, W.
