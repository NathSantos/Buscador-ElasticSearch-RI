Despite \n\nthe important advances the performance of cells-scaffold constructs, one of the several tissue \n\nengineering approaches, remains limited in part due to the need for optimize cell culture techniques and \n\nculture media. Nanocarrier systems have generated a significant amount of interest in the ex vivo cell \n\nmaintenance, and control of the cellular fate in vivo mainly due to their internalization efficiency, drug \n\nloading capacity, and to favorably modulate the solubility and pharmacokinetics of drugs. Dendrimers \n\nare synthetic, monodispersive, spherical and highly branched macromolecules that present unique \n\nadvantages and fulfills most requirements as carriers for drug delivery; however, it has been found that \n\nhigh generation dendrimers are often cytotoxic. Thus, in this thesis we focused our attention in this \n\nfundamental problem and explore the development of novel nanobiomaterials based on the grafting of \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) onto low generation poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers, the so-\n\ncalled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. These macromolecular vehicles were developed to \n\nexplore a new concept consisting on the intracellular and controlled delivery of bioactive molecules \n\naimed at control stem cells functions in a more effective manner ex vivo, and maintain the cellular \n\nphenotype in vivo upon re-implantation. Thus, by combining nanotechnology-based systems and \n\ntraditional tissue engineering strategies, we expect to develop a novel therapeutic solution for the \n\nefficient treatment of damage/diseased cells and tissues. To validate this new concept, there is the need \n\nto evaluate the performance of the developed nanocarriers, in vitro and in vivo.  Firstly, the uptake \n\nefficiency and internalization mechanism of fluorescent-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles was investigated using different cell types. Fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that \n\nthe developed nanocarriers could be efficiently internalized, either by cell lines and primary cultures, \n\nafter a few hours. Flow cytometry studies revealed that rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) \n\ncultured in the presence of colchicine, an alkaloid that inhibits endocytosis, decreased the internalization \n\nof the nanoparticles. These data showed that uptake by cells was primarily via an active endocytotic \n\nmechanism, but not exclusively. Preliminary studies were also carried out to evaluate the possible \n\napplicability of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the central nervous system. \n\nInternalization rate, cell viability and metabolic activity studies were performed using rat post-natal \n\nhippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells that revealed their ability for being taken up by these cells \n\nand its non cytotoxicity. Complementarily, dexamethasone (Dex), a glucocorticoid known to have \n\n\n\n- vi - \n \n\nimportant role on the proliferation and expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers, was used as a \n\nmodel drug and incorporated into the bulk of the nanoparticles. Physicochemical characterization and in \n\nvitro biological studies have demonstrated that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nwere successfully synthesized, were not cytotoxic in the range of concentration below 1 mg.mL-1 and \n\npromote osteogenesis (2-D system). To assess the true value of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles systems for application in tissue engineering strategies, we use different \n\nbiomaterials to develop a set of novel scaffolds both ceramic and polymeric or formulations. These \n\nscaffolds were found to be suitable for applications in bone, cartilage and osteochondral tissue \n\nengineering. In vitro studies have shown that combination of scaffolds, bone marrow stromal cells and \n\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (3-D system) enhanced osteogenesis. Finally, in \n\nvivo studies have shown that the novel Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may be \n\nbeneficial as intracellular nanocarrier, supplying Dex in a regimented manner, while avoiding the need of \n\nculturing stem cells for long periods of time in vitro, towards promoting the osteogenic differentiation. \n\nRemarkably, the proposed strategy allow modulate and direct stem cells differentiation towards \n\nosteogenic phenotype, enhance in vivo proteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis and promote \n\nsuperior de novo bone formation. This thesis mark the transition from the \u2018proof-of-concept\u2019 to useful \n\nintracellular nanocarrier tool, as the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles show promise \n\nfor application in direct stem cell to a particular cell fate, in vitro and in vivo.  \n\n\n\n- vii - \n \n\nNovas abordagens da nanotecnologia recorrendo a dendr\u00edmeros modificados com pol\u00edmeros \n\nnaturais para o controlo das fun\u00e7\u00f5es celulares de c\u00e9lulas estaminais e utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o em estrat\u00e9gias \n\nde engenharia de tecidos  \n\nRESUMO. \n\nGrandes progressos t\u00eam sido feitos nos \u00faltimos tempos no emergente campo cient\u00edfico da engenharia \n\nde tecidos. No entanto, a efici\u00eancia dos sistemas c\u00e9lulas-matriz tridimensional porosa, uma das \n\nestrat\u00e9gias usadas nas abordagens em engenharia de tecidos, tem sido limitada, em parte, pela \n\nnecessidade de se optimizarem as t\u00e9cnicas e os meios de cultura usados. Sistemas de nanopart\u00edculas \n\npara o transporte de mol\u00e9culas bioactivas t\u00eam suscitado grande interesse na \u00e1rea da biomedicina, \n\nnomeadamente no que respeita \u00e0 poss\u00edvel aplica\u00e7\u00e3o como suplementos em meios de cultura ex vivo, e \n\nno controlo das fun\u00e7\u00f5es celulares in vivo. Isto deve-se, principalmente, \u00e0 sua efici\u00eancia de \n\ninternaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, elevada capacidade de incorpora\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00e1rmacos, e ao facto de favorecerem a \n\nsolubilidade de mol\u00e9culas hidrof\u00f3bicas e de possibilitarem a modula\u00e7\u00e3o da sua farmacocin\u00e9tica.  Os \n\ndendr\u00edmeros s\u00e3o sistemas macromoleculares sint\u00e9ticos altamente ramificados que apresentam \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas \u00fanicas, tais como monodispersividade e uma estrutura esf\u00e9rica, e que preenchem a \n\nmaioria dos requisitos para serem usados como ve\u00edculos para a liberta\u00e7\u00e3o controlada de f\u00e1rmacos. N\u00e3o \n\nobstante, tem-se verificado que dendr\u00edmeros de elevada gera\u00e7\u00e3o apresentam tipicamente uma \n\ncitotoxicidade indesejada. Assim, nesta tese a aten\u00e7\u00e3o focou-se na resolu\u00e7\u00e3o deste problema \n\nfundamental. Para tal foi explorado o desenvolvimento de novos nanobiomateriais tendo como \n\nestrat\u00e9gia a liga\u00e7\u00e3o qu\u00edmica do pol\u00edmero carboximetilquitosano (CMCht) a dendr\u00edmeros de \n\npoliamidoamina (PAMAM) de baixa gera\u00e7\u00e3o, que se denominaram por nanopart\u00edculas de \n\ncarboximetilquitosano/poliamidoamina (CMCht/PAMAM). Estas macromol\u00e9culas foram desenvolvidas e \n\num novo conceito aplicativo foi testado relacionado com a sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em medicina regenerativa \n\ncomo ve\u00edculos de liberta\u00e7\u00e3o controlada e intracelular de mol\u00e9culas bioactivas, de forma a ser poss\u00edvel \n\ncontrolar efectivamente as actividades celulares, tais como a prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o e a diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00e9lulas \n\nestaminais ex vivo, e a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o do fen\u00f3tipo dessas mesmas c\u00e9lulas ap\u00f3s o seu implante. Assim, \n\nrecorrendo \u00e0 nanotecnologia e a estrat\u00e9gias usadas na engenharia de tecidos, espera-se que seja \n\nposs\u00edvel desenvolver uma nova solu\u00e7\u00e3o terap\u00eautica que possa possibilitar, de uma forma eficiente, o \n\ntratamento de c\u00e9lulas e tecidos danificados ou que apresentem algum tipo de patologia. De forma a \n\nvalidar este novo conceito, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio avaliar o potencial dos nanosistemas desenvolvidos, in vitro e \n\nin vivo. Primeiramente, a efici\u00eancia e o mecanismo de internaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de nanopart\u00edculas de \n\nCMCht/PAMAM ligadas a um marcador fluorescente foram investigados, recorrendo a estudos \n\n\n\n- viii - \n \n\ncelulares, in vitro. Estudos de microscopia de fluoresc\u00eancia revelaram que as nanopart\u00edculas \n\ndesenvolvidas s\u00e3o internalizadas por diferentes tipos de c\u00e9lulas ap\u00f3s algumas horas em cultura, \n\nincluindo linhas celulares e culturas prim\u00e1rias. Estudos envolvendo a citometria de fluxo mostraram que \n\nquando c\u00e9lulas multipotentes do estroma da medula \u00f3ssea de rato (RBMSCs), foram cultivadas na \n\npresen\u00e7a de colchicina, um alcal\u00f3ide inibidor da endocitose, exibiam menor capacidade de \n\ninternaliza\u00e7\u00e3o das nanopart\u00edculas. Assim, a internaliza\u00e7\u00e3o das nanopart\u00edculas pelas c\u00e9lulas ocorre \n\nprincipalmente por um mecanismo de endocitose, mas que este n\u00e3o \u00e9 o \u00fanico. Foram tamb\u00e9m \n\nrealizados estudos para determinar a taxa de internaliza\u00e7\u00e3o, viabilidade celular e actividade metab\u00f3lica, \n\nrecorrendo a neur\u00f3nios isolados do hipocampo de rato p\u00f3s-natais e c\u00e9lulas da glia. Estes estudos \n\nmostraram que as nanopart\u00edculas s\u00e3o internalizadas por estas c\u00e9lulas, e n\u00e3o afectam negativamente a \n\nviabilidade da cultura das c\u00e9lulas. A dexametasona (Dex), uma mol\u00e9cula pertencente \u00e0 fam\u00edlia dos \n\nglucocortic\u00f3ides e conhecida pelo seu papel na modula\u00e7\u00e3o da prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o e express\u00e3o  dos \n\nmarcadores de diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o osteobl\u00e1stica, foi usada como f\u00e1rmaco modelo e incorporada nas \n\nnanopart\u00edculas de CMCht/PAMAM. A caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmica e estudos biol\u00f3gicos in vitro \n\ndemonstraram que as nanopart\u00edculas de CMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex foram sintetizadas com \n\nsucesso, n\u00e3o apresentaram citotoxicidade em concentra\u00e7\u00f5es at\u00e9 1 mg.mL-1 e promoveram a \n\nosteog\u00e9nese (sistema de cultura 2-D). Por forma a avaliar o verdadeiro potencial aplicativo das \n\nnanopart\u00edculas de CMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex em estrat\u00e9gias de engenharia de tecidos, \n\ndiferentes biomateriais foram usados no desenvolvimento de estruturas tridimensionais porosas, \n\nincluindo cer\u00e2micos, pol\u00edmeros e formula\u00e7\u00f5es contendo ambos. Estas estruturas tridimensionais \n\nporosas mostraram-se adequadas para serem usadas em engenharia de tecidos de osso, cartilagem e \n\ndefeitos osteocondrais. Estudos in vitro revelaram que a abordagem constitu\u00edda por estruturas \n\ntridimensionais porosas, RBMSCs e nanopart\u00edculas de CMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex (sistema \n\nde cultura 3-D) promoveu um aumento significativo da osteog\u00e9nese. Por \u00faltimo, estudos in vivo \n\nmostraram que as nanopart\u00edculas de CMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex s\u00e3o um sistema de \n\nliberta\u00e7\u00e3o intracelular altamente eficiente, uma vez que possibilitaram a liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Dex com um perfil \n\ncin\u00e9tico adequado, permitindo assim evitar os longos per\u00edodos de cultura in vitro, necess\u00e1rios \u00e0 \n\ndiferencia\u00e7\u00e3o osteog\u00e9nica de c\u00e9lulas estaminais. A estrat\u00e9gia proposta permite modular e direccionar a \n\ndiferencia\u00e7\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas estaminais para o fen\u00f3tipo osteog\u00e9nico, aumentar a s\u00edntese de \n\nproteoglicanos da matriz extracelular e promover a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de osso num estado de matura\u00e7\u00e3o mais \n\navan\u00e7ado. Esta tese marca a transi\u00e7\u00e3o de \u201cprova de conceito\u201d para uma ferramenta aplicativa das \n\nnanopart\u00edculas desenvolvidas na liberta\u00e7\u00e3o intracelular de f\u00e1rmacos, uma vez que as nanopart\u00edculas de \n\nCMCht/PAMAM carregadas com Dex se mostraram promissoras no direccionamento das c\u00e9lulas \n\nestaminais para um determinado fen\u00f3tipo, in vitro e in vivo. \n\n\n\n- ix - \n \n\n TABLE OF CONTENTS. \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS .......................................................................................................................................... i \n\nABSTRACT .............................................................................................................................................................. v \n\nRESUMO ................................................................................................................................................................ vii \n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS .......................................................................................................................................... ix \n\nLIST OF ABBREVIATIONS ................................................................................................................................... xix \n\nLIST OF FIGURES ............................................................................................................................................... xxiii \n\nLIST OF TABLES .............................................................................................................................................. xxxvii \n\nSHORT CURRICULUM VITAE .......................................................................................................................... xxxix \n\nLIST OF PUBLICATIONS ....................................................................................................................................... xli \n\nINTRODUCTION TO THE THESIS FORMAT ...................................................................................................... xlix \n\n \n\nSECTION 1 .............................................................................................................................................................. 1 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER I.   \n\nDendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review .............. 3 \n\nAbstract .................................................................................................................................................................... 5 \n\n1.

MTS results showed that the metabolic activity/cell viability \n\nof both cell populations was not dramatically altered between the two tested groups. Similar results were also \n\nobtained for the total protein quantification (n=3, mean + SD, p>0.05) ........................................................... 272 \n\nFigure 3. Post-natal hippocampal neurons were able to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles (A). Initially neuronal cells disclosed a high variability on the capacity of internalizing \n\nthe nanoparticles. However results tended to be more homogeneous after 24 hours of incubations, reaching a \n\nmaximum of internalization (around 80-90%) after 48 hours of incubation (B). Further experiments (C-E) also \n\nshowed that the maintenance of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticle concentration in \n\nthe culture medium was essential to maintain the levels of internalization. The differences observed in C-E \n\nwere attributed to the proliferation of other cell populations within the hippocampal neuron cultures, namely \n\nneuroprogenitor cells (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p<0.05) ............................................................... 274 \n\nFigure 4. Internalization experiments within cortical glial cell cultures showed that astrocytes were also able to \n\ninternalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (A- after 48 hours of incubation). As it \n\ncan be observed in (B) the internalization occurred in a gradual manner reaching a peak (around 100% of \n\ninternalization) after 48 hours of incubation). When exposed for longer periods of time it was observed that the \n\n\n\n \n \n\n- xxx - \n \n\nperiodical addition of nanoparticles to the culture medium was needed to stabilize the levels of internalization \n\n(C-E); (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p<0.05) ....................................................................................... 275 \n\nFigure 5. ligodendrocytes also reveal to be capable of internalizing the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles. (A) representative image of the nanoparticles distributed along the intracellular \n\ncompartment. As it can be observed they were scattered around the nucleus, as well as distributed along the \n\ncytoplasmatic processes of the cells. Within the oligodendrocyte population it was possible to observe three \n\nplateau of internalization, being the highest obtained after 48 hours of incubation (B- around 80-90%).  \n\nSimilarly to what happened with neurons and astrocytes, the maintenance of the internalization levels within \n\nthe oligodendrocyte cell population was dependent on the maintenance of the concentration of the FITC-\n\nlabeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture medium (C-E); (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + \n\nSD; p<0.05) ..................................................................................................................................................... 277 \n\nFigure 6. Microglial cells were able to internalize FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a \n\nfaster rate (A,B) when compared to other neuronal and glial cell populations. This fact cannot be dissociated \n\nfrom the phagocytotic capability of these cells. Furthermore, figure A also allowed observe that the size of the \n\nparticles internalized by microglial cells was higher when compared to the one disclosed by other cell \n\npopulations. Similar effects to those previously observed with other cell populations regarding the influence of \n\nthe periodical addition of nanoparticles on the levels of internalization were also observed (C-E). This result is \n\nprobably related with the macrophage-like behaviour of these cells ............................................................... 278 \n\nFigure 7. Cortical glial cells cultures were treated with FDU in order to determine if the decrease on the rates \n\nof FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization by astrocytes (A-C) and \n\noligodendrocytes (D-F) was related to their cell proliferation. As it can be observed, whenever astrocyte and \n\noligodendrocyte cells proliferation is impaired, the levels of internalization are not dependent on the periodical \n\nadditions of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to the culture medium. This fact is an \n\nindication that the results observed in Figures 4 and 5 are related with the cell proliferation of the above \n\nreferred cell populations.................................................................................................................................. 279 \n\n \n\nCHAPTER VIII. \n\nThe osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells cultured with dexamethasone-loaded \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles .................................................................... 283 \n\nFigure 1.

The late is organized in four sections that include a total of \n\neleven chapters. The body of thesis chapters is based on the series of related papers published in \n\ninternational journals or submitted for publication, which are specified with each chapter. Thus, each \n\nthesis chapter is presented in manuscript form in a style consistent with the papers, i.e. an abstract, \n\nintroduction, materials and methods, results, discussion and conclusions sections. A list of references is \n\nalso provided as a subsection within each chapter. The order of thesis chapters is as given below. \n\n \n\nSECTION 1:  \n\nThe first chapter is this thesis introduction and is concerned on reviewing the exploratory research \n\nmerging nanotechnology and regenerative medicine. It also summarizes the fundamentals on the \n\nsynthesis and macromolecular structure, ability to design and improve the biological performance of \n\ndendrimers and its derivatives. Special focus is devoted on the novel applications and recent work \n\ninvolving dendrimers in the fields of tissue engineering and central nervous system, but extends into \n\ngene delivery and theranostics, which are succinctly reviewed. Some remarks on the need to conduct \n\ncomprehensive research in vivo are provided, and new research directions are also proposed. \n\n \n\nSECTION 2:  \n\nChapter II fully describes the experimental work and protocols related to the obtained results. Along with \n\nChapter I, it provides a guideline of the rationale for the research, namely on the aspects related with \n\nthe selection of the materials, on the developed processing routes, and characterization strategies and \n\nprotocols used. \n\n \n\nSECTION 3:  \n\nThe thesis chapters included within this section are based on the series of related papers that resulted \n\nfrom research work already published or submitted for publication. \n\nChapter III describes a novel \u201cautocatalytic\u201d electroless deposition route for production of composite \n\nscaffolds composed of hydroxylapatite (HAp) and carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) for bone tissue \n\n\n\n \n \n\n- l - \n \n\nengineering scaffolding applications. The physicochemical characterization in terms of architecture, \n\ndegradability and bioactivity is presented herein. \n\nChapter IV reports a new methodology for developing HAp scaffolds by using an organic sacrifice \n\ntemplate, and its potential to find applications in bone tissue engineering scaffolding investigated. The \n\nnovelty of this work consists on the possibility of obtaining porous and highly interconnected scaffolds \n\nmimicking the sacrificial component. It were evaluated the physicochemical properties of the HAp \n\nscaffolds. Cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds was investigated by both carrying direct observation of \n\nmouse fibroblasts cells (L929 cell-line) death and performing a luminescent cell viability assay rat bone \n\nmarrow stromal cells (RBMSCs).  \n\nChapter V describes the development of novel hydroxylapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) bilayered scaffold \n\nby combining a freeze-drying technique for the cartilage region and a layer for bone regeneration based \n\non the HAp supports developed in the previous chapter. The developed HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds \n\nare aimed at find applications in osteochondral TE strategies, and were characterized herein by different \n\ntechniques. The intrinsic cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds extract \n\nfluids was investigated by carrying out a cellular viability assay (MTS test) using mouse fibroblastic-like \n\ncells. Moreover, in vitro cell culture studies were carried out to evaluate the capacity of HAp and CHT \n\nlayers to separately, support the growth and differentiation of goat bone marrow stromal cells \n\n(GBMSCs) into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, respectively.  \n\nChapter VI describes the synthesis of surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) \n\ndendrimer (CMCht/PAMAM) nanoparticles for applications as a intracellular nanocarrier. Such \n\nstructures are proposed to be used as carriers to deliver bioactive molecules aimed at controlling the \n\nbehaviour of stem cells, namely their proliferation and differentiation. Cytotoxicity and internalization \n\nefficiency was investigated using both human osteoblast-like cells and RBMSCs, under fluorescence-\n\nactivated cell sorting and fluorescence microscopy analyses. As a model drug, dexamethasone (Dex) \n\nwas incorporated into CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and release rates were determined by \n\nhigh performance liquid chromatography. Moreover, the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles osteogenic potential was also investigated using RBMSCs and compared to that of typical \n\nosteogenic media, in vitro.  \n\nChapter VII preliminary evaluates the possible applicability of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles in central nervous system (CNS). Internalization rate, cell viability and metabolic activity \n\nstudies were performed using post-natal hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells.  \n\n\n\n- li - \n \n\nChapter VIII was designed to investigate the effect of combining novel Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles and, both HAp (developed in Chapter IV) and SPCL scaffolds (3-D system) on \n\nthe proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs, in vitro. A detailed biological characterization \n\nis presented. \n\nChapter IX is the first of two in vivo studies and exploits the potential of the combinatorial strategy in \n\ntissue engineering principles employing CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles towards the \n\nintracellular release and regimented supply of Dex aimed at control stem cells osteogenic differentiation \n\nin the absence of typical osteogenic inducers, in vivo. The effect of initial cell number seeded in the HAp \n\nscaffolds on the bone forming ability of the constructs was also investigated. Qualitative and quantitative \n\nnew bone formation was evaluated using the non-destructive micro-computed tomography analysis of \n\nthe explants, and Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining of the explant sections, followed by \n\nhistomorphometrical analysis.  \n\nChapter X reports deeper studies on the chemistry of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles namely the data on proton nuclear magnetic resonance, dynamic light scattering and zeta \n\npotential analyses. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization efficiency, \n\nosteogenic potential and bone forming ability were also evaluated, in vitro and in vivo. For this study, \n\nSPCL scaffolds were used as the 3-D matrix, as these scaffolds exhibit lower attenuation coefficient \n\nthan bone, thus we can envision investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the calcified tissue within the \n\nexplants using a non-destructive and time-saving technique such as micro-computed tomography.  \n\n \n\nSECTION 4:  \n\nThis thesis ends with Chapter XI, which is the summary and conclusions of the research work under the \n\nscope of this thesis.  \n\n\n\n \n \n\n- lii - \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nSECTION 1. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHAPTER I. \n\nDendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a \n\nreview \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.

Although many of the work involving dendrimer synthesis and traditional applications has been \n\nwell documented many hot issues should be examined and thus need to be reviewed, namely those \n\nrelated with most recent and notable advances of dendritic polymers that show promise in the field of \n\nregenerative medicine.  Herein, a review is given on dendritic nanopolymers, especially on dendrimer \n\nand dendrons technology and their surface engineering to deliver and target drugs or bring imaging \n\nagents to the targets where they are required. This review begins with a brief overview on the \n\nexploratory research merging nanotechnology and regenerative medicine. Fundamentals on the \n\nsynthesis and macromolecular structure of dendritic polymers are provided. The unique advantages of \n\ndendrimers comparing to traditional macromolecular architectures (e.g. linear, cross-linked, branched) \n\nare a consequence of their inherent properties, i.e. large surface area, shape, functionalization, and \n\nhigh efficiency for the cellular uptake which possibly dendrimers fulfill the requirements as carriers for \n\ngene, nucleic acids, bioactive molecules and peptide/protein delivery. The huge portfolio of degradable \n\nand non-degradable controlled-release vehicles are being investigated for their processing into \n\nnanocarriers, several new emerging nanomaterials are being studied for their biodegradability, \n\ncontrolled-release and stimuli-responsive properties. Therefore, the release of different or multiple \n\nbioactive agents, each with its own kinetic profile, which can be released under the action of specific \n\nstimuli, is becoming possible. However, to make use of this potential, toxicological, drug loading \n\ncapacity and host-guest chemistries in dendrimers must be addressed. These issues are included within \n\nthe scope of this review. Moreover, we will discuss possible strategies that can be taken to overcome \n\nsome of the dendrimers limitations. Further attention is given on the progress in the targeting strategies \n\nand it is discussed its importance in the therapeutic efficiency and in avoiding the undesired secondary \n\neffects of several drugs. Therefore, their ability to target delivery to specific sites in the human body \n\npossibly the improvement of the bioavailability of therapeutic molecules, decrease the dosage and \n\nfrequent re-dosage needs. In addition, integration of the nanocontrolled-release systems with other \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 6 - \n \n\ndesirable functions to create new and cross-discipline applications can also be realized by means of \n\nusing dendrimer technology. In the following sections of this review, special focus is provided on the \n\nnovel applications and recent work involving dendrimers in both fields of tissue engineering and central \n\nnervous system. In regenerative medicine field, dendrimer-based polymers have been attracting great \n\nattention as drug delivery system (DDS) to deliver bioactive molecules aimed at modulate the behavior \n\nof stem cells, i.e. their proliferation and differentiation, in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, due to their \n\ninnovative character other applications beyond DDS became possible, namely as scaffolding and \n\nchemoattractants for tissue regeneration, and implantable biodegradable nanomaterial-based medical \n\ndevices integrated with drug delivery functions (theranostics). Finally, within the scope of this review we \n\nhighlight promising areas for further research and succinctly comment on how and why dendrimers and \n\ndendrons technology should be viewed as the next generation of biomaterials for the 21st century. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter is based on the following publication: Oliveira JM, Salgado AJ, Sousa N, Mano JF, and \n\nReis RL, Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: \n\na review, (2009), submitted. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 7 - \n\n \n\n1. INTRODUCTION \n\nDuring the 20th century, we have assisted to great innovations on polymer synthesis and advances in \n\nthe design of biodegradable chemistries. These achievements allowed obtaining macromolecules of \n\nmultiple compositions and novel architectures possessing unique physicochemical and biological \n\nproperties. Synthetic polymers can be divided into four key architectural classes: linear, cross-linked, \n\nbranched, and dendritic structures. The first three types have been studied extensively in the past. The \n\nfourth comprises the nature-inspired dendrimers and its derivatives and are reviewed herein. These are \n\nhighly branched and nanospherical macromolecules, and are the most prominent example of nano-\n\npolymer revolution. The first report is attributed to Tomalia et al. [1] and dates to the early 1980s.  These \n\nnovel structures differ from typical linear polymers, since their architecture is extremely precise and \n\ncontrolled conferring them with tunable and predictable molecular weights, biodegradability and \n\nbiocompatibility. This chemistry revolution igniting many possibilities and it is not surprisingly that we \n\nnow assist to their burst exploitation in a variety of medical applications.  \n\nIn this review, we report on the noteworthy scientific advances and most recent literature, dealing with \n\nthe dendritic polymers nanotechnology and brief discuss on the convergence of nanotechnology and \n\nregenerative medicine. Fundamentals on dendrimers will be succinctly provided. Numerous synthetic \n\nstrategies have been reported for the preparation of dendrimer-based materials. The present review will \n\nalso focus on the most recent advances in the dendrimers surface engineering, which allowed obtaining \n\nnovel and promising complexities (architectures and chemical functionalities) such as the dendronized \n\npolymers. Interesting features reported for dendronized polymers are also discussed, as well as some \n\nsuggestions for potential applications such as tissue engineering (TE), central nervous system (CNS), \n\ngene delivery and theranostics will be also highlighted wherein.  \n\n1.1. CONVERGENCE OF NANOTECHNOLOGY AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE \n\nIn 1959, Richard Feynman [2] coined nanotechnology as a futuristic approach to the development of \n\nmaterials atom by atom. The ultimate goal of nanotechnology can be described as the ability to apply \n\nthe nanoscale principles and work at the atomic, molecular and supramolecular levels (on the range of \n\n1-100 nm) to understand, and create material systems by assembling molecules into objects or vice-\n\nversa. Nanotechnology provides solutions for the transformation of biosystems and provides a broad \n\ncollection of technologies, techniques and processes for real life purposes. Current and potential \n\napplications of nanotechnology in medicine range from research involving diagnostic devices, drug \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.

DENDRITIC POLYMERS-DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONS: FUNDAMENTALS AND \n\nBIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS \n\nDendrimers are a unique class of synthetic polymers which play an important role in emerging \n\nnanotechnology [78,79]. The term \u2018\u2018dendrimer\u2019\u2019 (from greek: dendra, tree and meros, part of) describes the \n\narchitecture of this emerging class of polymeric macromolecules which possess 3-D features that \n\nresemble a tree (Figure 1). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. The typical dendron structure resembles the architecture of a tree (Photo obtained from Casa \n\nMil\u00e0 also known as La Pedrera-Barcelona, and makes figurative meaning to Tomalia inspiration from \n\nnature and a poetic analogy of the dendrimers to nature\u2019s architecture and geometric forms). \n\nPresently, the dendritic architectural class can be divided into four subclasses: random hyperbranched \n\npolymers, dendrigraft polymers, dendrons, and dendrimers [79].  More than 100 different dendrimers and \n\n1,000 surface chemistries are currently known.  \n\nIn this section we will deal with the dendrimers fundamental aspects. A typical dendrimer structure \n\nconsists of three basic components (Figure 2): multifunctional central core (?) where other molecules \n\ncan be trapped [80], branched units (Y) that emanates from the central core and external capping-groups \n\n(E). The highly regular branching units are organized in layers called \u2018\u2018generations\u2019\u2019, and represent the \n\nrepeating monomer unit of these synthetic macromolecules [79]. Therefore, dendrimers can be \n\nsynthesized from simple branched monomer units, in a precise and controlled fashion from trunk to \n\nDendronDendron\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.

Dendrimers can be designed to provide a quite versatile choice of \n\nexternal functional groups [73] in order to reduce cytotoxicity, enhance transepithelial transport [80,81], for \n\ninteraction with coupling molecules such as natural-based polymers [82] and fluorescent probes [83]. The \n\nsurface groups may also act as passive or reactive gates controlling entry or departure of molecules \n\nfrom the dendrimer interior. Surface properties can also allow control clearance and biodistribution in the \n\nbody.  \n\nE EE\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE EE E\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE EE\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE EE E\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\n \n\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of the dendrimer typical structure. \n\nTheir size, shape, and topology, as well as flexibility and surface functionality, are controlled at the \n\nmolecular level (all three architectural components), which makes them useful building blocks and \n\ncarrier molecules at the nanometer level, but also possibly to precisely manipulate both molecular \n\nweight and chemical composition. This new class of synthetic [84-86], highly branched, nanospherical \n\nmacromolecules presents unique features in comparison to the traditional linear, cross-linked and \n\nbranched  polymers [79,87], thus many researchers have explored their potential in many biological \n\napplications. An advantage is related with the fact that the narrow molecular weight distributions (Mw/Mn \n\n= 1.0000-1.05) can provide reproducible pharmacokinetic behavior [79]. \n\nThere are different types of dendrimers which are classified as: (i) glycodendrimers and (ii) peptide \n\ndendrimers. Glycodendrimers have been showing a great potential as drug carrier. The term \n\n\u2018glycodendrimer\u2019 has been used to describe dendrimers that include carbohydrates into their \n\narchitecture. The vast majority of glycodendrimers have saccharide residues on their outer surface, but \n\nglycodendrimers containing a sugar unit as the central core from which all branches emanate have also \n\nbeen described. Generally, glycodendrimers can be classified as: (i) carbohydrate-centred, (ii) \n\ncarbohydrate-based and (iii) carbohydrate-coated dendrimers. The late will be further exploited in \n\nsection 3, the so-called dendronized polymers.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 11 - \n\n \n\nBy its turn, Sadler et al. [88] broadly defined peptide dendrimers  as \u2018\u2018radial or wedge-like branched \n\nmacromolecules consisting of a peptidyl branching core and/or covalently attached surface functional \n\nunits\u2019\u2019. Thus, this definition includes any dendrimer with an amino acid core, branching units, surface \n\nfunctional groups or any combination of the three as a peptide dendrimer. In dendrimer synthesis, \n\naminoacids are also appealing building blocks because peptide-coupling techniques can be used.  \n\nDespite, most research on dendritic polymers has been conducted with glycodendrimers.  \n\nBoth the synthesis and applications of glycodendrimers and peptide dendrimers have been reviewed by \n\nmany [88-91]. Succintly, two different synthetic strategies are currently explored for synthesizing \n\nstructurally well defined dendritic polymers, namely the divergent [87,92] and convergent growth [93-95] \n\napproaches. Most of the commercially available dendrimers, such as the Tomalia\u2019s dendrimers \n\npoly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers from Dendritech Inc. (Midland, MI, USA) and \n\npoly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendrimers from DSM (Geleen, The Netherlands) are produced by divergent \n\nmethod. This methodology involves in situ branch-cell construction in stepwise and iterative stages \n\naround a desired core to produce core-shell structures. In the convergent method (Fr\u00e9chet approach) \n\ndendrons are synthesized according to the divergent approach and then are anchored to a \n\nmultifunctional core. Both strategies possess advantages and disadvantages and the appropriate route \n\ndepends mainly on the type of monomer used and the desired structure. Although there are different \n\nroutes to synthesise dendrimers, their maximum size is typically in the order of ~10-20 nm [96,78]. \n\nRecently, a novel synthetic route has been proposed for new low-cost Priostar dendrimers [97,98]. \n\nUnlike traditional polymers, the unique characteristics of dendritic polymers make possible their use in a \n\nwide range of applications. Among the myriad of possibilities, dendritic polymers can find applications as \n\na delivery carrier of drugs [80,99,100], and on the development of synthetic vaccines [101] and antitumour \n\nsystems [102,103] and immunology [104,105]. Other applications in the bioscience field includes blood \n\nanticoagulant [106] and microbicidal [107-109] activities. For example, Jiang [110] reported on a poly-(L-lysine) \n\n(PLL) dendrimer with a polyanionic outer surface consisting of 32 naphthalene disulfonate units, also \n\nknow as Vivagel (Starpharma Ltd., Melbourne, Australia) to be used as topical vaginal microbicide for \n\nHIV prevention. These were found to be safe and prevent HIV-1 infection by binding to receptors on the \n\nviral coat. The promising results potentate VivaGel entering phase II clinical trials in humans [111]. Other \n\ndendrimer-based DDS have also proved to effectively enhance anti-viral activity by reducing the viral \n\nload, in vitro [112,113]. Dendrimers have also been useful in prion research [114-116] since cationic \n\ndendrimers are shown to perturb peptide fibrillation in a process dependent on the nature of the charged \n\ngroups on the dendrimer surface. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 12 - \n \n\nRegarding the antitumour systems, dendrimers mimicking the surface structure of proteins involved in \n\nangiogenesis inhibition have been developed [117,118]. Angiogenesis is an important process for tumour \n\ngrowth and is initiated by angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and \n\nbasic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF). These growth factors bind to their receptors on endothelial cells \n\nwith the dependence of heparin or heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) in extracellular matrix (ECM). \n\nThe participation of binding to heparin or HSPG leads to potential targets for antiangiogenic activity. \n\nEndostatin, a weel-known endogenous angiogenic protein binds to heparin or HSPG and inhibits some \n\nfunctions of endothelial cells, resulting in potent suppression of angiogenesis. To find a new potent \n\nangiogenic inhibitors, Shimamura and coworkers [118] have focused their attention on characteristic \n\npositive-charge-rich surface of endostatin and the interaction between its arginine residues and either \n\nheparin or HSPG. This group design novel arginine-rich dendrimers, TX-1943 (8 Arg residues) and TX-\n\n1944 (16 Arg residues), which mimic the surface structure of endostatin and evaluated their \n\nantiangiogenic ability, in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies demonstrated that both dendrimers bound to \n\nheparin [118]. During this study, it was also observed that angiogenesis inhibition of b-FGF stimulated \n\nproliferation and tube formation of endothelial cells, in vitro; however TX-1944 antiangiogenic activity \n\nwas stronger than that of TX-1943. Moroever, both type of dendrimers exhibited potent antiangiogenic \n\nactivity in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay, in vivo. These data suggest that \n\narginine dendrimer can be used in prevention of the growth and metastasis of solid tumours. \n\nThe innovative synthetic procedures increased the accessibility to the functionalization of dendrimers \n\nwith transition metals in the core, finding interesting applications in catalysis [119-122]. Actually, \n\ndendrimers can combine the advantages of homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts. Homogenous \n\ncatalysts are known for having a good accessibility of active sites. Despite, one of the disadvantages lie \n\non the fact that it is difficult to separate from the reaction stream. On the contrary, heterogeneous \n\ncatalysts are easy to separate from the reaction mixture but the disadvantage is that kinetics of the \n\nreaction is limited by mass transport. Dendrimers have a multifunctional surface and all catalytic sites \n\nare always exposed towards the reaction mixture. Metallodendrimer research has been steadily gaining \n\nground during the last few years. Several authors have been proposing the use of dendrimers to \n\ndevelop complexes with metals such as Pt [123], Ag [124,125], Fe [126], Cu and Ni [127].   \n\nBenito et al. [128,129] demonstrated the synthesis of carbosilane dendrimers with N,N?-pyridylimine \n\nmolybdenum and platinum at their periphery. In addition, similar complexes have also been described \n\nby Al-Hamra [130]. This work reports on the synthesis of second and third generation dendrimers based \n\non PLL with a pentaamine cobalt (III) metal complex at the core, following a divergent synthetic \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 13 - \n\n \n\napproach. The use of the cobalt complex served as the C-terminal protecting group, which facilitate \n\npurification and enhanced the dendrimers\u2019 solubility in aqueous and organic solvents.  Similarly, Bellis \n\n[131] synthesised a series of surface-functionalized proline-modified PPI dendrimers as metal-free \n\ncatalysts for asymmetric aldol reactions which showed improved solubility in organic solvents. Another \n\ngroup [132] reported on the synthesis of lipophilic dendrimers, containing crown ether moieties with \n\ndifferent sizes as the core, surrounded by poly(aromatic ether) wedges of different generations. The \n\nsynthesis route consisted on the use of bis(bromomethyl)-substituted crown ethers and Fr\u00e9chet-type \n\npoly(benzyl ether) dendrons as building blocks.  \n\nMost metallodendrimers are built from organic skeletons, in particular from dendrimers of types PAMAM \n\nor PPI. However, a lot of examples are also known for fluorinated [133] and phosphorus-containing \n\ndendrimers [134,135]. \n\nIt has been demonstrated that dendrimers containing phenylene ethylene units exhibit a correlation \n\nbetween the molecular geometry and the electronic properties [136]. In addition, it was also shown that \n\nthe light-gathering properties increase with the generation although the excitation transfer efficiency to \n\nthe core decreases for generations higher than the sixth [136,137]. Dendrimers are mainly attracting the \n\ninterest of many scientists because of their unique physicochemical characteristics and geometry [138]. \n\nLight harvesting dendrimers own their efficiency to a highly directed process that delivers captured light \n\nenergy to the core [139]. For example, Akai et al. [140,141] have studied the energy transfer and shielding \n\neffect in different types of dendrimers. The most recent work, reports on the wire-type dendrimers \n\npossessing a poly-(p-phenylenevinylene) backbone and having oligophenylene light-harvesting (LH) \n\nantenna. This study has demonstrated the ability of wire-type dendrimer with a LH-antenna as highly \n\nefficient light-emitting material. Andrews et al. [142], reported a new approach for modeling the multi-step \n\nflow and that possibly to reveal the character and patterns of internal energy flow in dendrimeric \n\nmaterials. Similar applications have been proposed for fullerodendrimers, i.e. the fullerene-based \n\nPAMAM-type dendrons. Thus, dendrimers have been useful for encapsulation of core moieties. \n\nAlthough the conformation that a dendrimer assumes around a core moiety cannot be directly \n\ndetermined, the effect of increasing dendrimer size on the photophysical and electrochemical properties \n\nof the core has been exploited. Araki et al. [143] have been developing fullerodendrimers for application \n\nas artificial photosynthesis systems. Their work has shown that the rate constants and quantum yields \n\nof photo-induced electron transfer with the added aromatic amine donors in benzonitrile tend to \n\ndecrease with the dendron generation. These data thus indicated that the bulky dendron groups acted \n\nas barriers for the donor molecules to approach the C60 moiety in the core of the dendrimers. Other \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 14 - \n \n\nworks [144,145] have shown much promise of iridium-based phosphorescent and phenylazomethine \n\ndendrimer complexes as light emitting materials for efficient organic light emitting diodes.  \n\nAs proposed by Ceroni [146], metal-containing dendrimers can be classified from structural viewpoint as: \n\n(i) dendrimers built around a metal complex as a core; (ii) dendrimers containing metal complexes as \n\nbranching centers; (iii) dendrimers containing metal complexes as peripheral units; (iv) dendrimers that \n\ncan coordinate metal ions by ligand units that are present in the branches; and (v) dendrimers with a \n\ncore which is able to coordinate a metal ion. \n\nIt is likely that improving design of dendrimers will lead to coordination compounds capable of \n\nperforming even more sophisticated functions, such as energy up-conversion and \n\nelectrochemiluminescence. \n\nApplications of dendrimers in more traditional technologies such as coatings and inks have also been \n\nexploited, as their spherical shape shows unique rheological characteristics [147]. Dendrimers versatility \n\nfurther explains their importance in optic, electronics and magnetic applications [148-150]. Interestingly, a \n\nrecent work [151] propose the use PAMAM dendrimers adsorved onto native oxide surfaces of silicon \n\nwafers as a strategy to direct the integration of metal electrodeposition with silicon microfabrication \n\nprocesses and selective deposition by dendrimer patterning. \n\nAlonso et al. [152] have describe the development of an amperometric enzyme electrode for glucose \n\nmonitoring. This high sensitive electrode consisted on the electrostatic immobilization of the enzyme \n\nglucose oxidase onto C and Pt electrodes modified with mixed ferrocene-cobaltocenium dendrimers. \n\nThis work showed that higher generation dendrimers to be more efficient electron transfer mediators, \n\nand can find applications as sensors. In another study [153], PPI dendrimer cores functionalised with \n\noctamethylferrocenyl units were deposited onto a Pt electrode. Amperometric biosensors for glucose \n\nwere prepared by immobilization of glucose oxidase (GOX) onto the electrodes and their applications as \n\nhydrogen peroxide and glucose sensor was investigated. It was also shown that electrodes modified \n\nwith polymethylferrocenyl dendrimer promote the redox reactions of hydrogen peroxide and its efficiency \n\nwas affected by structural characteristics of the dendrimers when low working potentials are used. \n\nDespite, the biosensors developed possess a good linear response region, and superior sensitivity and \n\nreproducibility as compared with other ferrocene-mediated glucose sensors. \n\nYao et al. [154] have reported on enzyme field effect transistor (ENFET) for determining glucose. This \n\nbiosensor was produced with dendrimer encapsulated Pt nanoparticles and GOX via a layer-by-layer \n\nself-assembly method. This work demonstrated that the developed biosensor possess good stability, \n\nenhanced sensitivity and extended lifetime as compared to conventional ones. By its turn Buschbeck \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 15 - \n\n \n\n[155] has been proposing the surface modification of low generation dendrimers with triethylene glycol \n\nmethyl ether units to develop ionophores for chemical sensors. \n\nAnother work [156] using erythrocyte ghosts demonstrated that the addition of fourth generation PAMAM \n\ndendrimer and PAMAM-OH has a dual effect on the activity of human erythrocyte membrane \n\nacetylcholinesterase (AChE). Low dendrimer (25 ?M) concentrations caused a statistically significant \n\nincrease of the enzyme activity. For dendrimer concentrations higher than 100 ?M, it was observed an \n\ninhibition of AChE. The efficiency of the inhibition was similar for both amine- and hydroxyl-terminated \n\nPAMAM dendrimers; however, the maximum of activation occurred at a different range of dendrimer \n\nconcentration; 25 ?M for PAMAM-OH (G4) and 100 ?M for PAMAM (G4). The advanced explanation for \n\nthe changes of AChE activity upon addition of dendrimers was related with the alteration in protein \n\nstructure, but may be associated with the structural changes in the whole membrane.  A study reported \n\nby Shcharbin [157] aimed at clarify whether AChE inhibition was a result of direct action of dendrimers on \n\nthe enzyme or a result of indirect changes in lipid bilayer of membrane. By performing fluorescence \n\nanalysis it was demonstrated that anionic and cationic dendrimers changed AChE conformation and the \n\nstrongest effect was induced by carboxylic-tterminated PAMAM dendrimers (G3.5). It was also \n\ndemonstrated that changing on AChE conformation and catalytic activity depended on type and \n\nconcentration of the dendrimer.  \n\nAnother interesting work reported by Kub\u00e1t et al. [158], investigated the interaction of porphyrins with \n\nPAMAM dendrimers of different generation and external groups, in aqueous solution. In that work, the \n\nbinding of porphyrins to PAMAM dendrimers is controlled mainly by electrostatic interactions between \n\nporphyrins and terminal groups of PAMAM dendrimers (amine or carboxylic groups), and depended on \n\nboth porphyrin peripheral functionalization and pH of the solution. Moreover, low and high generation \n\ndendrimers formed complexes with porphyrins. \n\nShcharbin et al. [159,160] have been studying the interaction of serum albumins with cationic dendrimers. \n\nIn their first study [159], they investigated the interaction of a fourth generation PAMAM dendrimer and \n\nserum albumins from human (HAS) and bovine (BSA) origin. This study demonstrated that serum \n\nalbumins and PAMAM G4 dendrimer form complexes with stoichiometry of 4-6:1 for PAMAM:HSA and \n\n4-5:1 for PAMAM:BSA molar ratio. Results obtained from circular dichroism, fluorescence polarization \n\nand zeta-potential experiments have shown that dendrimers did not significantly change the secondary \n\nstructure of proteins, and interactions between protein and dendrimer were weak. Based on the 3-D \n\ncrystal structures of HSA and BSA, they identified five non-specific anionic regions for binding of \n\ncationic dendrimers. Another study [160] investigated the effect of the generation of PAMAM dendrimers \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 16 - \n \n\n(G2 and G6) on the binding to bovine serum albumin (fatty acids free and loaded with different fatty \n\nacids). This comprehensive work has shown that although proteins loaded with fatty acids have more \n\nstable structures and were less sensitive to the action of dendrimers, BSA-fatty acid complexes bound \n\nto PAMAM dendrimers. Results suggested that the efficiency of the interaction depended on the fatty \n\nacids loaded on the protein, i.e. PAMAM dendrimers were able to compete with BSA for fatty acids if \n\ntwo or three fatty acids were loaded per protein.  \n\nAn important characteristic of dendritic molecules is their improved solubility in a large number of \n\norganic solvents [161,162]. An understanding of the interfacial interactions is important to the biomedical \n\napplications of these polymers. In this respect, it has been shown that dendrimers are able to change \n\ntheir conformation on the different alkanethiol surfaces due to their flexibility. Abdelhady et al. [163] have \n\nconducted an atomic force microscopy (AFM) study to understand the factors affecting the interactions \n\nof fourth generation  PAMAM dendrimers with substrates of defined surface chemistry. Their results also \n\nsuggest that the surface conformation of such dendrimer molecules can depend upon the nature of the \n\ndifferent functionalized substrates.  \n\nRecently, Allabashi [164] has reported on an easy method for manufacturing composite filters cross-\n\nlinked with silylated dendritic polymers and cyclodextrins (CD). Triethoxysilylated derivatives of PPI \n\ndendrimer, PPI and polyglycerol hyperbranched polymers and ?-cyclodextrin (?-CD) were impregnated \n\ninto Al2O3, SiC and TiO2 membranes and were tested for the removal of a variety of organic pollutants \n\nfrom water. The obtained data proved their efficiency on removing up to 99% polycyclic aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons, 93% of the monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and up to 43% of pesticides, among \n\nothers. \n\nCromer and coworkers [165] have proposed the use of functionalized dendrimers as endotoxin sponges. \n\nUsing in vitro and in vivo models of septic shock, they demonstrated that PAMAM dendrimers partially \n\nmodified by hydrophobic groups effectively bind and sequester bacterial lipopolysaccharides. Therefore, \n\nthese systems potentially can be useful for the therapy of Gram-negative sepsis. Interestingly, Labieniec \n\net al. [166] studies provide the first evidence of the therapeutic effect of fourth generation PAMAM \n\ndendrimers. These were found to lower plasma glucose and suppress long-term markers of diabetic \n\nhyperglycaemia, in vivo.  \n\nDespite the many advantages and superior performance of the dendrimers highlighted herein, few can \n\nbe obtained with high generations, with exception of PAMAM, PPI, polyphosphane, and triallyl phenol. \n\nSynthesis of high generation dendrimers, useful for exploring the nature of the dendritic architecture, \n\ndepends critically on the nature of the constituent monomers, their reactivities, and the method of their \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 17 - \n\n \n\npreparation. Krishna et al. [167] have previously shown that poly(propyl ether imine) (PETIM) dendrimers \n\n(G3) possessing alcohol, amine, nitrile, ester or carboxylic acid groups at the peripheries can be \n\nobtained. Moreover, during their studies it was demonstrated that PETIM dendrimers with carboxylic \n\nacid groups were non-toxic over two different cell lines: human breast cancer T47D and African green \n\nmonkey kidney (CV-1) cells. Jayamurugan et al. [168] have also reported on the synthesis of high \n\ngeneration PETIM dendrimers. This group obtained PETIM dendrimers up to G6 by carrying out simple \n\niterative steps consisting of two alternate Michael additions and two reduction reactions. The \n\ndisadvantage is that the procedure is long, but the overall yields are quite good for lower generations. \n\nThey have shown to be possible tailoring the peripheries of these dendrimers by introducing different \n\ngroups such as alcohols, amines, carboxylic acids, esters, or nitriles, and up to 128 external groups, \n\nthereby opening up new properties and possibilities for several applications.  \n\nThe well-defined hyperbranched structure of dendrimers has motivated chemists to explore the \n\npossibility for mimicking protein functions with dendritic macromolecules [169], such as O2-carrying \n\nhemoproteins [170] and Coenzyme B12 [171]. In the next section, this issue will be explored further. \n\n3. DENDRITIC POLYMERS IN REGENERATIVE MEDICINE \n\n3.1. DRUG DELIVERY APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS \n\nThe development of nanotechnology-based efficient drug delivery systems for small molecules, proteins \n\nand DNA has been attracting great deal of attention over the last few years. Unlike traditional polymers, \n\ndendrimers can be obtained in precise molecular weights even at high generations, which as previously \n\nhighlighted can provide a reproducible pharmacokinetic behaviour. This feature makes them ideal \n\ncandidates for drug delivery applications. Despite, a efficient drug delivery systems should meet other \n\ncriteria, such as: (i) structural control over size and shape of drug or imaging-agent cargo-space; (ii) \n\nbiocompatibility, non-toxic polymer/pendant functionality; (iii) precise, nanoscale-container and/or \n\nscaffolding properties with high drug loading capacity; (iv) well-defined scaffolding and/or surface \n\nmodifiable functionality for cell-specific targeting moieties; (v) lack of immunogenicity; (vi) appropriate \n\ncellular adhesion and internalization, (vii) adequate bio-elimination or biodegradation; (viii) controlled or \n\nstimuli-responsive drug release features; (ix) molecular level isolation and protection of the drug against \n\ninactivation during transit to target cells; (x) minimal non-specific cellular and blood-protein binding \n\nproperties; (xi) ease of consistent, reproducible, clinical grade synthesis. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 18 - \n \n\nIn regenerative medicine, the control of cells behavior at the nanoscale is addressed via cell-adhesion \n\nreceptors. The surface of eukaryotic cells is covered with an array of glycoconjugates, (e.g. \n\nglycoproteins and glycolipids). Extracellularly, carbohydrates in some of the glycoconjugates play a key \n\nrole in the process of cell-cell and cell-pathogen adhesion. Furthermore, they also participate in such \n\nfundamental processes as glycan cross-linking in the ECM. Intracellularly, carbohydrate receptors are \n\ninvolved in such key biological processes as protein folding and sorting of proteins (e.g. the degradative \n\nlysosomal enzymes). It is the weak binding of most carbohydrate ligands for their protein receptors, that \n\nrequires these carbohydrates to be clustered in order to attain biologically meaningful affinities toward \n\ntheir receptors (e.g. lectin type) [172]. In order to refine the biological activities and drug delivery by \n\ndendritic polymers, efficient carbohydrate ligands of the glycodendrimer-type are emerging as potent \n\nligands for carbohydrate-binding proteins. Such type of molecules can be obtained through surface \n\nengineering using a carbohydrate coating on the dendrimeric system, the so-called dendronized \n\npolymers (Figure 3).  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. Comparison of the structure of (A) PAMAM dendrimer (G2), (B) PAMAM dendrimer bearing \n\ncarbohydrate end groups (dendronized polymer). \n\nDendrimers modified with the terminal carbohydrate polymers constitute a new class of biopolymers \n\nwith many interesting applications. Dendronized polymers can be conveniently synthesized with a good \n\nyield using both divergent and convergent approaches or using as well chemoenzymatic approaches \n\n[173]. Another advantage of these systems is related with the chemical nature of the synthetic linker and \n\nthe possibility of tailoring the type of glycosidic linkages in these compounds, which gives us additional \n\nflexibility to meet demands from the point of view of hydrophobicity, and biodegradability [172].

Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 19 - \n\n \n\nthese compounds can grow to considerable size by successive cycles of branching, which give them a \n\nunique possibility to vary the degree of carbohydrate clustering required by the carbohydrate receptors. \n\nPotentially, such type of molecules can be used for treatment and control of metabolic disorders \n\ninvolving carbohydrates, and protection against certain types of infections.  \n\nDendronized polymers with a variety of shapes, core molecules, carbohydrate residues and valences \n\nare made available for the biological evaluation. This new class of materials is expected to exhibit \n\nentirely new properties since the structures might have sizes larger than 10 nm and different surface \n\nproperties [85]. In fact, the linking of terminal sugar residues such as heparin on dendrimers can create a \n\nmultivalent display that mimic cell-surface glycans [174]. This strategy showed that heparin dendrimers \n\npromote FGF-2-mediated mitogen-activated kinase activation in L6 myoblasts. Thus, these \n\nglycodendrimers can modulate heparin-protein interactions.  \n\nIt has been found [175] that high generation dendrimers (G7) with amine capping-groups causes \n\nhaemolysis and changes the morphology of red cells, since they bind to membranes of cells (negatively \n\ncharged) in a non-specific manner and can cause toxicity in vitro and in vivo. Similar findings were \n\nreported by Domanski et al. [176] that investigated the effect of PAMAM dendrimers concentration and \n\ngeneration (G2, G3 and G4) on human red blood cells. This paper demonstrated that erythrocyte shape \n\nchanged and was accompanied by dendrimer-induced haemolysis when these cells were exposed to \n\nnanoparticules concentrations ranging between 1 nM and 1 ?M. Moreover, it was conclusive that when \n\nhigher dendrimer generation was used, a lower concentration of PAMAM dendrimer was needed to \n\ncause haemolysis. These observations were supported by the work of Jevprasesphant et al. [177]. The \n\ncytotoxicity of unmodified PAMAM dendrimers towards Caco-2 cells was appreciably higher for cationic \n\n(whole generation) compared with anionic (half generation) dendrimers and for both types increased \n\nwith increasing size (generation) and concentration. King Heiden et al. [178] have also demonstrated that \n\nPAMAM dendrimers amine-terminated (G4) are toxic and attenuated growth and development of \n\nzebrafish embryos at sublethal concentrations.  However, PAMAM dendrimers carboxylic terminated \n\n(G3.5) were not toxic to zebrafish embryos. Dutta et al. [179] study corroborated previous findings that \n\ndemonstrated the cytotoxic behaviour of PPI dendrimer amine-terminated (G5), in vitro. Recently, \n\nLibieniec et al. [166] have also shown the cytotoxic effects of PAMAM dendrimers (G4), in vivo.  It was \n\nfound that PAMAM dendrimers increased mortality of streptozotocin-diabetic rats. In a study reported by \n\nNeerman [180], melamine dendrimer were developed and their potential as a vehicle for drug delivery \n\napplications was investigated. The preliminary in vitro study has shown a decrease in Clone 9 cells \n\nviability at 0.1 mg.mL-1 as compared to that of cells cultured in the presence of dextran. For the in vivo \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 20 - \n \n\nstudy, mice were administered with increasing concentrations of dendrimer via i.p. injection. At a higher \n\nconcentration (160 mg.kg-1), 100% mortality was observed and histopathological data revealed \n\nhepatoxicity. At low concentrations (2.5-40 mg.kg-1) of the dendrimers, no mortality was seen, and no \n\nhepatic damage was found. These data suggest that the toxicity of the melamine-based dendrimer is \n\ncomparable to the cationic PAMAM dendrimers, and further studies needs to be carried out to evaluate \n\ntheir potential as DDS. \n\nSurface engineered dendrimers with carbohydrates should make it also possible to avoid the cytotoxic \n\neffects of cationic and high generation dendrimers and reduce the haemolytic toxicity by \n\nreduction/shielding of the positive charge on the dendrimer surface, while enhancing the peripheral \n\ncongestion to improve container properties. The development of strategies for the synthesis of \n\ndendrimers based on novel cores and branches continues to be one of the important aspects of \n\ndendrimer chemistry due to the need for tailoring rigidity and density to refine drug release kinetics. \n\nSashiwa and coworkers [82,181-183] have established the synthesis of a variety of chitosan-dendrimer \n\ndendronized polymers mainly by two procedures: i) dendrimers bearing aldehyde and a spacer are \n\nsynthesized, and then these are reacted with chitosan by reductive N-alkylation, and ii) linking of \n\nchitosan to the dendrimer surface. The first approach has the advantage of no crosslinking during the \n\nreaction.  The second allows use of commercially available amino-dendrimers such as PAMAM and \n\npoly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) dendrimers. At least two binding points are available; however, this can be a \n\ndrawback as it can cause an undesired crosslinking. Following these studies, Oliveira and coworkers \n\n[184] have proposed surface engineer PAMAM dendrimers with the water-soluble carboxymethylchitosan \n\n(CMCht) to develop novel sphere-like nanoparticles aimed at find application as carriers to deliver \n\nintracellularly bioactive molecules. These are aimed at control from inside the behavior of stem cells, \n\nnamely their proliferation and differentiation. Dubber et al. [185] previously reported on the synthesis of a \n\ncarbohydrate-centered PAMAM dendrimers. First, D-glucose was converted into its per-aminoethyl-\n\nfunctionalized derivative, which was then submitted to the multi-step reaction for obtaining the PAMAM \n\nbranches. Domanski et al. [186] also shown that thiophosphate dendrimers (G5) were neither haemotoxic \n\nnor cytotoxic within the concentration range from 100 pM to 10 ?M, thus being good candidates for drug \n\ndelivery. A marked decrease in the cytotoxicity of amine-terminated PAMAM dendrimers was noted \n\nwhen the surface was modified with the addition of six lauroyl or four PEG chains [177]. Dutta et al. [179] \n\nhave demonstrated that the surface modification of PPI (G5) dendrimers with mannose and N-tert-\n\nbutoxycarbonyl (t-Boc) decrease haemolitic toxicity and cytotoxicity over HepG2 and COS-7 cell lines, in \n\nvitro. Moreover, an in vivo study [187] using Wistar rats showed that administration of PPI dendrimers \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 21 - \n\n \n\n(G5) caused haemolysis and tissue degeneration, after 24 hours. On the contrary, no signs of toxicity \n\nwere observed in animals to which surface-modified PPI dendrimers were administered, suggesting that \n\nfunctionalization of dendrimers leads to drastic reduction of toxicity and increases biocompatibility. \n\nMakimura and coworkers [188] have investigated glycodendrimers with a lysine core and with different \n\ncarbohydrates on the exterior. Compared to the mono-functional structure, L-lysine dendrimers with 8 or \n\n16 sialic acid residues show enhance binding properties and efficiently suppress the hemagglutination \n\nof erythrocytes.  \n\nA surface engineering strategy was also on the basis of Jevprasesphant et al. [189] work to improve the \n\nproperties of dendrimers. It was found that conjugation of cationic PAMAM dendrimers with lauroyl \n\nchloride decreased their cytotoxicity and increased their permeation through Caco-2 cell monolayers. \n\nAnother study [178] has demonstrated that when the tripeptide Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) was conjugated to \n\nPAMAM dendrimers (G4), these were less potent in causing embryo toxicity as compared to \n\nnonconjugated dendrimers.  \n\nDendronized polymers can display a higher loading capacity and allow the bulk incorporation of \n\nbioactive molecules of higher molecular weights and of different chemistry, while maintaining high \n\ninternalization and transfection efficiency as compared to conventional dendrimer (Figure 4). For \n\nexample, Kono et al. [190] designed PEG-modified dendrimers having a shell of hydrophobic amino acid \n\nresidues in the peripheral moiety of the dendrimer to increase their encapsulation ability. L-\n\nphenylalanine or ?-benzyl-l-glutamate residues were introduced to all chain ends of fourth generation \n\nPAMAM dendrimers, and then PEG (Mw 2000) chains were attached to the amino acid residues. \n\nResults have shown that the surface engineering of the PAMAM dendrimers improved the binding of \n\nRose Bengal guest molecules than the dendrimer without the external layer. \n\nDendritic polymers offer an interesting possibility as complexing agents for enhanced transdermal \n\ndelivery of hydrophobic drugs [100]. Several dendrimers have shown solubility enhancement of drugs \n\nsuch as dexamethasone (Dex), nifedipine, camphotecin, quinolones and indomethacin that are \n\nhydrophobic or not very soluble in water [92,100,191,192].  Other studies [193,194] have also demonstrated the \n\nability of PAMAM dendrimers to enhance the solubility of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \n\n(NSAIDs), such as naproxen, ketoprofen, ibuprofen and diflunisal. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.

Dendronized polymer loaded with a drug: incorporation in the bulk (A) and covalent bonding to \n\nfunctional groups (B). \n\nThe existence of inner cavities with different architectures in the dendrimers can be used to design \n\ncontrolled delivery systems [195], where the drug pharmacokinetics can be modulated as desired [100,196-\n\n198]. The interior of the dendrimers needs to be hydrophobic so that a drug can be loaded. The exterior \n\nof the dendrimer, however, usually needs to be hydrophilic to improve the bioavailability in the body [198]. \n\nFactors such as the ionization state of the drug have also been reported to affect the release of drug \n\nfrom PAMAM dendrimers [199].  \n\nOn the other hand, high drug loading influences the water solubility of the product and the biodistribution \n\nof the conjugates [200]. Agashe et al. [201] have studied the biodistribution pattern of the PPI dendrimer-\n\nbased carbohydrate (mannose and lactose)-coated glycodendrimers (G5) in mice, in order to explore \n\nthe potential of these systems as drug carriers. These complexes were found to be stable both in vitro \n\nand in vivo. All systems were cleared rapidly from circulation. Moreover, clearance of mannose-coated \n\nPPI dendrimer and lactose-coated PPI dendrimer was faster than PPI alone. All complexes \n\naccumulated in liver, but only those with terminal carbohydrate moieties were retained for a longer \n\nperiod of time, which was related to lectin-carbohydrate interactions. This information is significant since \n\nit serve as a useful platform in designing carbohydrate-coated dendrimers for the delivery of bioactive \n\nagents to liver.  \n\nThe attraction of dendronized polymers as DDS arises from the possibility to control and refine drug \n\ndelivery. Actually, they can allow a temporally controlled delivery of single or multiple compounds, since \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 23 - \n\n \n\nstep-wise degradation can be achieved due to the variety of chemical linkages within their structure \n\n(Figure 5). \n\nA B C\n\n \n\nFigure 5. Photos of dendrons and figurative representation of nature\u2019s architecture and controlled-\n\nrelease strategy (top). Schematic representation of the step-wise (A?C) degradation of dendronized \n\npolymers, from periphery to core (bottom). \n\nResponse to certain stimulus is a fundamental process of living systems.  Learning from nature inspired \n\nscientists to develop materials that  respond  to  external  stimuli  such  as temperature,  pH,  light,  \n\nelectric  field,  chemicals and  ionic  strength [202]. Thus, smart or stimuli-responsive polymers respond to \n\nspecific changes in their environment and as a consequence dramatic changes in their physical \n\nproperties occurs (e.g.  shape,  surface  characteristics,  solubility,  formation  of an  intricate molecular \n\nself-assembly or a sol-to-gel transition). The versatility of smart polymeric materials makes them one of \n\nthe most appealing interfaces of chemistry and biology. Interestingly, it has been reported [203-206] \n\ndendrimers whose degradation can be initiated by different induced-reactions either at the periphery and \n\ncore, which lead to their complete depolymerization, the so-called self-immolative dendrimers.             \n\nHiu et al. [207] have reported on dendritic PAMAM core (G3) and poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethyl \n\nmethacrylate) (PDMA) synthesized via a atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), the so-called    \n\nG3-PAMAM-g-PDMA. Chlorambucil (CLB), an anticancer drug was used as a model drug. The \n\ncontrolled drug release from polymers with different average graft length of PDMA was investigated by \n\nUV spectroscopy. Results have shown that the rate of the drug release could be controlled by pH. \n\nActually, release of CLB from the dendrimer derivative was faster at pH 1.4 than at pH 10.0. Moreover, \n\nthe release of CLB from G3-PAMAM-g-PDMA was apparently slower as compared to that from CLB \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 24 - \n \n\nincorporated into the PAMAM dendrimer. In addition, these studies have also shown that                     \n\nG3-PAMAM-g-PDMA presented a typical thermo-responsive character.  \n\nPistolis et al. [208] have reported on amine-terminated diaminobutane PPI dendrimers (DAB-32 or      \n\nDAB-64) as pH-sensitive controlled-release systems. As a model system, pyrene was incorporated into \n\nthe PPIs dendrimers. Release studies revealed that pyrene incorporation is favored in basic \n\nenvironments and mainly close to the core of PPI dendrimers, while its release is induced in acidic \n\nmedia.  \n\nZheng et al. [209] have synthesized dendrimer-star poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM) polymers \n\nwith narrow Mw using dithiobenzoate-terminated PPI dendrimer (G2 and G3) via a reversible addition-\n\nfragmentation transfer (RAFT). The aqueous solution of the dendrimer-star PNIPAAM was found to be \n\nthermo-sensitive with a LCST around 32?C. Thus, the use of methacrylic acid along with NIPAAM, not \n\nonly induce changes in the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) but also allows obtaininge \n\nmaterials responsive to both temperature and pH. \n\npH and T-activated polymers demonstrated to be successful drug delivery systems. By its turn, \n\nphotochemical-internalization (PCI) allows site-specific delivery, i.e. escape of the macromolecules from \n\nendocytic vesicles into the cytosol. Lai et al. [210] have conjugated doxorubicin (Dox) to PAMAM \n\ndendrimers via pH-sensitive and insensitive linkers, acid-labile hydrazone linkages (PAMAM-hyd-Dox) \n\nand amide (PAMAM-amide-Dox), respectively. In their study they combined doxorubicin-dendrimers \n\nwith different PCI strategies to evaluate the cytotoxic effects. Results showed that both PCI strategies \n\npromoted the PAMAM-amide-Dox cytosolic distribution, but significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of \n\nfree Dox on human gingival cancer (Ca9-22) cells at higher concentrations. The authors failed to \n\ndevelop a multi-modality cancer treatment, but their data provided insights on possible research \n\ndirections, namely the need to exploit other spacers besides amide-linkage, in drug-polymer complexes. \n\nPapagiannaros et al. [211] have screened the cytotoxic of Dox-PAMAM dendrimer complex attached to \n\nliposomes using different human cancer cell lines (e.g. lung, colon, breast, central nervous system and \n\nprostate). In this innovative work Dox was incorporated into PAMAM dendrimers (3:1 molar ratio) (1) \n\nwith an efficiency of 97%, and the anticancer activity investigated. Dox-PAMAM complex was also \n\nattached to hexadecylphosphocholine:eggphosphatidylcholine:stearylamine 10:10:0.1 (molar ratio) (2) \n\nand eggphosphatidylcholine:stearylamine 10:0.1 (molar ratio) (3) liposomes and the incorporation \n\nefficiency was 91 and 95%, respectively. The in vitro cytotoxicity tests revealed that Dox-PAMAM \n\ndendrimers retained high growth inhibiting activity which was decreased when the complex attached to \n\nliposome 3. The activity of Dox was enhanced when hexadecylphosphocholine was incorporated to \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 25 - \n\n \n\nliposomal formulation (2). Formulation 2 was superior from all the three formulations against all cell lines \n\ntested. It is of interest that the dendrimeric liposomal formulation enhanced the activity of Dox against \n\none type of breast cells. The most sensitive cell lines were those originated from lung cancer, \n\nsuggesting a selective action of Dox as compared to the rest of the cell lines. This was an incouranging \n\nand promosing data, showing that dendrimeric liposomal formulations may be a valuable strategy for the \n\nsuperior performance of DDS aimed at treat several types of cancer. \n\nWiwattanapatapee [212] investigated the use of dendrimers for colon-specific drug delivery applications. \n\nIn their studies, 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) was bound to the water-soluble dendrimer using different \n\nspacers containing azo-bond (e.g. p-aminobenzoic acid, PABA and p-aminohippuric acid, PAH). PAH \n\nprovide the polymer conjugates a higher loading capacity (3 times) for 5-ASA as compared to that of \n\ndendrimer conjugates with PABA as the spacer. In vitro studies with cecal content of rats were carried \n\nout for investigating drug release from dendrimer conjugates. The release of 5-ASA from both \n\nconjugates was significantly slower as compared to that of sulfasalazine (SA), a commercial prodrug. \n\nMoreover, the conjugate with PAH linker showed significant higher amount of initial drug release than \n\nthe conjugate with the PABA linker. As a consequence, the amount of drug released from PAMAM-\n\nPAH-SA was significantly higher than that of PAMAM-PABA-SA conjugate. This study nicely illustrated \n\nthe potential use of PAMAM dendrimer for colon-specific drug delivery, and the important role of the \n\nspacers for the optimization of drug release. \n\nGhorai and coworkers [213] have described the first molecules of anthracene capped chiral dendrimers \n\nderived from a 1,3,5-trisubstituted aromatic core and carbohydrate units in the interior and periphery. \n\nThese are claimed to be suitable for anchoring other useful functionalities aimed at find applications as \n\nDDS and light harvesting materials. \n\nIt is known that carbohydrate substructures of cell surface glycoconjugates constitute important binding \n\nsites for pathogen infection. Dendrimeric systems for use in a lectin-binding assays have been \n\ndeveloped [214]. Mannose receptors are present in the surface of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/Mac), \n\nalveolar macrophages, astrocytes in brain, and hepatocytes in liver. For example, targeting of anti \n\nretroviral drugs to macrophages, which by its turn are the target cells for HIV, could be an attractive \n\napproach in improving the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the toxicity of antiretroviral drugs. In this \n\ncontext, Dutta [113] explored the targeting potential and anti-HIV activity of lamivudine (3TC, antiretroviral \n\ndrug) loaded mannosylated fifth generation poly(propyleneimine) dendrimers (MPPI). The entrapment \n\nefficiency of 3TC loaded MPPI and PPI dendrimers (G5) were found to be ~43 and ~36%, respectively. \n\nThe in vitro release profile showed that mannose-modified PPI slows down drug release as compared to \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 26 - \n \n\nthat of unmodified PPI dendrimers. The results of in vitro internalization studies showed significant \n\nincrease in lymphoblast human T (MT2) cells uptake of 3TC when MPPI was used as compared to that \n\nfor PPI and free drug. This result evidence that MPPI interacts with the lectin receptors present on the \n\nsurface of MT2 cells leading to its enhanced cellular uptake. Antiretroviral activity was determined using \n\nMT2 cell lines by estimating p24 antigen by ELISA, which is a widely accepted method of quantifying the \n\nviral load in HIV infection. 3TC loaded PPI and MPPI formulations were found to possess higher       \n\nanti-HIV activity, mainly due to the enhanced cellular uptake of 3TC. These data suggest that the \n\nproposed MPPI drug delivery carrier has great potential to increase the efficacy and reduce the toxicity \n\nof antiretroviral therapy.  \n\nTuftsin, a natural macrophage activator tetrapeptide constituted of Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg, presents a broad \n\nspectrum of activities and binds to several cells of immune system. For example, Dutta et al. [112] have \n\nsynthesized a tuftsin conjugated PPI dendrimers (G5) for targeting to circulating Mo/Mac. These \n\nsystems proved to hold potential for the controlled and targeted delivery of antiretroviral drugs. Tuftsin-\n\nconjugated-PPI stimulated the phagocytic activity of the Mo/Mac especially in HIV infected cells, \n\ncontributing to the anti-HIV activity of the drug due to its inherent antiretroviral activity. These materials \n\nwere also found to be non-cytotoxic, in vivo [187]. \n\nResearch on dendrimeric-based artificial virus receptors has been attracting great deal of attention. \n\nYamada et al. [215] successfully synthesized a novel class of carbosilane dendrimer periphery-\n\nfunctionalized lacto-N-neotetraose, which is aimed at mimic dengue virus receptor. In another work [214], \n\nthey synthesized carbosilane dendrimers periphery-functionalized with lactotriaose (GlcNAc?1-3Gal?1-\n\n4Glc) with valencies of three, four, six, and twelve for use in a lectin-binding assay. The hexavalent \n\nglycodendrimer showed a 2500-fold larger binding effect than that of free lactotriaose, though the \n\ndodecavalent one exhibited only a 1200-fold larger binding effect. Interestingly, the same group also \n\nreported [216] on the potential of carbosilane dendrimers periphery-functionalized with galabiose (three, \n\nfour, and six galabiose residues) for use as artificial inhibitors against Shiga toxins. Bhadra et al. [217] \n\nhave synthesized PPI dendrimers-coated with galactose and investigated the efficienct on delivering \n\nprimaquine phosphate (PP, a liver schizonticide) directly to liver cells. Results showed that the coating \n\nof PPI systems with galactose increases the drug entrapment efficiency, prolonged circulation and drug \n\nrelease as compared to uncoated PPI delivery systems. Another interesting work reported by Agrawal \n\n[218] demonstrated a method for synthesize galactose-coated PLL dendrimers having polyethyleneglycol \n\n(PEG-1000) as core. This method consisted on alternating protection and deprotection steps of L-lysine \n\nby di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (di-BOC) until the formation of peptide dendrimer (G4) took place. Moreover, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 27 - \n\n \n\nthey successfully loaded these macromolecules with chloroquine phosphate, which is extensively \n\nemployed for the suppression and treatment of malaria. The internalization studies of uncoated and \n\ncoated drug dendrimer formulations in macrophages revealed almost 5 times reduced phagocytosis due \n\nto galactose coating. Galactose coated peptide dendrimers   drastically reduced haemolytic activity \n\ncompared to uncoated PLL formulation. Haematological data suggested that galactose-coating strategy \n\ndecrease immunogenicity as compared to uncoated formulations. \n\nCarbosilanes bearing saccharide residues on their surface were first introduced by Matsuoka et al. [219]. \n\nAn innovative work [220], described the synthesis of glycodendrimer via carbosiloxane formation. In this \n\nwork, a hydrosilylation route for attaching carbohydrate derivatives to carbosilane backbones without \n\nusing any hetero atoms was described.  \n\nPrieto et al. [221] have investigated the cytotoxicity of sulfadiazine complexed with fourth generation \n\nPAMAM dendrimers. Cell culture studies using fibroblasts (Vero cells) and macrophages (J-774 cells) \n\nhave revealed that the dendrimeric sulfadiazine complexes did not affect membrane integrity at low \n\nconcentrations (0.03 ?M). Moreover, cytotoxicity tests using human intestinal adenocarcinoma cells line \n\n(Caco-2 cells) results showed that dendrimeric sulfadiazine did not reduce viability of Caco-2 cells over \n\nthe tested concentrations as compared to that for PAMAM (G4). Remarkably, the in vivo study has \n\nshown that brain and muscle of Wistar rats are the main targets of intravenous administration of \n\ndendrimeric sulfadiazine, which can be advantegeous for drug delivery applications directed to central \n\nnervous system.  \n\nFor efficient encapsulation and delivery of 5-fluorouracil (anti-cancer drug), Bhadra [222] also exploit the \n\nsurface modification route of PAMAM dendrimers with PEG. PEGylation of the systems was found to \n\nincrease the drug-loading capacity of the nanocarrier, reduce the drug release rate and haemolytic \n\ntoxicity. In another work [223], PEGylated PPI (G5) dendrimers were developed for sustained delivery of \n\nfamotidine, a H2 receptor antagonist. In vivo investigations demonstrated that there was a marked \n\ndifference in the percentage of drug distribution from the bound drug through PEGylated dendrimer \n\nwhen compared with the free drug. Similar studies were carried out by Haba et al. [224]. They have \n\nprepared biocompatible nanocapsules consisting of polyamidoamine (G4) dendrimer having both a PEG \n\nchain and a methacryloyl group at every chain end of the dendrimer through an L-lysine residue. \n\nTherefore, these works support previous findings showing that PEGylation can increase circulation time, \n\nthe sustained release of therapeutic molecules and improve haemocompatibility. Recently, Kono et al. \n\n[225] provided deeper insights on the designing of dendrimer-based carriers for accurate drug delivery. \n\nThey have developed PAMAM dendrimers (G4) that have a glutamic acid (Glu) residue at every chain \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 28 - \n \n\nend of the dendrimer. Then, to obtain PEG-modified dendrimers with sites for conjugation, PEG chains \n\nwere attached to amino groups of Glu residues. Dox was linked to side chains of the Glu residues by an \n\namide bond, [PEG-Glu(Dox)-G4], or hydrazone bond, [PEG-Glu(NHN-Dox)-G4]. The developed \n\nsystems were stable under physiological conditions, and Dox molecules were released from            \n\nPEG-modified dendrimers in acidic environments such as those of endosomes/lysosomes. The Dox-\n\nbearing dendrimers showed much lower toxicity to HeLa cells as compared to free drug. However, it \n\nwas evident that the conjugates with hydrazone bonds exhibited higher cytotoxic effects than those with \n\namide bonds. These results suggest the importance of pH-sensitive hydrazone linkage for high \n\ncytotoxicity. Furthermore, the PEG-modified dendrimers exhibited a similar level of toxicity to that of \n\nDox-resistant (SBC-3/ADR100) cells and their parent Dox-sensitive SBC-3 cells. \n\nEarly studies have been performed with peptide dendrimers and other peptide-binding dendrimers, to \n\nevaluate peptide-protein and protein-protein interactions. These showed that dendrimer-based research \n\ncan be a valuable tool for elucidating these processes. For example, Tam et al. [105] proposed peptide \n\ndendrimers to act as immunogens, also  known as multiple antigen peptides (MAPs).  \n\nCD derivatives bearing peptides may be useful as carriers for transporting drugs to biological targets \n\ncontaining specific peptide receptors. Thus, the peptide bio-recognizability together with the CD host-\n\nguest complexation properties makes such systems suitable templates for the application in site-specific \n\ndrug delivery. Much effort has been made to complex low generation dendrimers with other polymers. \n\nFor example, Dodziuk et al. [226] have reported on their attempts to complex a first generation dendrimer \n\nhaving four branches with ?-, ?- or ?-cyclodextrins, however, NMR studies showed that were not \n\nsuccessful. Muhanna et al. [227] have reported a different strategy. Their study has shown the synthesis \n\nof tetradecavalent amino acid and peptide dendrimers based on a ?-CD core. These were found to have \n\ngreat potential for application in MAP concept as a means to increase the peptide-receptor binding and \n\nhence improve the site specificity of the drug delivery system. Imae [228] investigated the binding of \n\nPAMAM dendrimer to sodium hyaluronate (NaHA). They successfully synthesized the PAMAM/NaHA \n\ncomplexes. Moreover, the static light scattering data showed that when the dendrimers bind to the \n\nNaHA chain, the wormlike character of NaHA is scarcely changed at low mixing [NH2]/[COO?] ratios. \n\nHowever, the structure of NaHA changed to a rodlike one at high [NH2]/[COO?] values, where the \n\nterminal numbers of dendrimers exceed at least five times the repeating unit numbers of a NaHA chain. \n\nThey postulated that electrostatic interaction is essential but not sufficient to connect such large \n\nnumbers of dendrimers to NaHA, because the number of amino terminal groups is 42 times larger than \n\nthe number of carboxylates. Therefore, they concluded that hydrogen-bonding interaction, besides the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 29 - \n\n \n\nelectrostatic interaction, should play an important role in the formation of these complexes. For rational \n\ndesign of intracellular nanocarriers, it is important to better understand the transport mechanisms across \n\nbiological barriers. In general transport of nanosystems is dependent on one hand, on their nature \n\nnamely their location, function and permeability and on the other, on the nature of the nanocarrier \n\nmolecules (e.g. molecular weight, charge, hydrophobicity, flexibility) and geometry [229]. Figure 6 shows \n\na simplified representation of the endocytotic route of nanoparticle aimed at act as intracellular reservoir \n\nof drugs.

Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 30 - \n \n\nwere firstly, labeled with FITC. Results revealed that dendrimers are internalized by human lung \n\ncarcinoma epithelial cells (A549 cell line). Using inhibitory drugs (e.g. sucrose, chlorpromazine, filipin, \n\nnocodazole and cytochalasins) for endocytosis, they found that nanoparticles uptake is mainly by fluid-\n\nphase endocytosis, independently of the external functionality. Although, significant differences in \n\nuptake mechanisms were seen. For example, anio-nic dendrimers appear to be mainly internalized by \n\ncaveolae mediated endocytosis in A549 lung epithelial cells, while there were evidences of cationic and \n\nneutral dendrimers internalization by a non-clathrin, non-caveolae mediated mechanism that may be by \n\nelectrostatic interactions or other non-specific fluid-phase endocytosis. Confocal microscopic studies \n\nrevealed that cationic dendrimers were mostly localized in the endosomes in the cell periphery. By its \n\nturn, both anionic and neutral dendrimers were found to localize in the lysosomes. These data have \n\nshown that the surface charge of the dendrimers strongly influences their uptake by cells and \n\nintracellular localization, thus opening up new possibilities of targeting therapeutic agents to subcellular \n\norganels. Pisal [231] investigated the permeability of arginine- and ornithine-conjugated PAMAM \n\ndendrimers (G4) across Caco-2 cell monolayers. Firstly, conjugates were obtained by linking the \n\npolyamines to the amine groups of the PAMAM dendrimers (G4) using an Fmoc synthetic route, and \n\nthen conjugates were labeled with fluoroscein isothiocyanate (FITC). The in vitro cell culture studies \n\nrevealed that surface-modification of dendrimers increase permeability. The mechanisms by which the \n\npolyamines improve the permeation of the dendrimers remain unclear. Despite, the authors speculated \n\non the disruption of intercellular tigh junctions as one possible mechanism. Similarly, Seib et al. [232] \n\nhave reported on the endocytic properties and intracellular trafficking of both linear and branched PEIs, \n\nand cationic PAMAM dendrimers (G2-4) in B16F10 murine melanoma cells. All polymers were first \n\nconjugated to Oregon Green (OG) and carefully characterised in respect of pH- and concentration-\n\ndependence of fluorescence. Flow cytometry studies revealed that uptake rate for PAMAM (G4) was the \n\nhighest, followed by branched PEI, linear PEI, PAMAM (G3) and at last PAMAM (G2). Cells were \n\ncultured in the presence of the dendrimers and chlorpromazine or wortmannin to assess the \n\nmechanisms of uptake. The precise mechanisms of PAMAM internalisation were once not totally \n\nclarified, but the authors suggest that PAMAM (G4) internalisation can be cholesterol-dependent.  \n\nWhen comparing to traditional macromolecular architectures (i.e. linear, crosslinked, branched), the \n\nunique features of the dendrimers and dendrimeric systems can improve the cellular uptake, \n\nbioavailability of therapeutic molecules inside the cells for long time periods, and consequently decrease \n\nthe dosage and frequent re-dosage needs. For developing safer and even more efficient dendrimeric \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 31 - \n\n \n\nnanocarriers, there is the need to intensify the comprehensive research on the mechanisms of cellular \n\nuptake.  \n\n3.2. TISSUE ENGINEERING (TE) APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS  \n\nIn the recent years, great advances have been done in the emerging field of TE and regenerative \n\nmedicine. Many important data have been published, and thus there is a need to overview the most \n\nrecent achievements and scientific considerations in this particular area of research. The objective of \n\nthis section is to highlight the most recent and relevant reports in the field of TE and regenerative \n\nmedicine, and stress its utility and feasibility by giving some examples of successful clinical treatments. \n\nDue to the multidisciplinary nature of this field we were encouraged to cover many other related issues, \n\neven if succinctly. The regenerative potential of different cells (and its sources), and the control of its \n\nfunctions by means of using different bioactive agents will be discussed. The TE strategies used for the \n\nregeneration of specific body parts are also addressed as well as the requirements (e.g. cell/material \n\ninteractions and surface chemistry) that should be met for optimal performance of the TE cells-scaffold \n\nconstructs. The role of bioreactors in TE is also briefly discussed. Finally, new promising strategies are \n\nproposed, namely the use nanocarriers such as dendrimers and dendronized polymers for the \n\ncontrolled and targeted delivery of bioactive agents that are aimed at modulate the cells functions such \n\nas proliferation and differentiation.  \n\n3.2.1. TE strategies: an overview \n\nIn our body there are different cell types, which can be categorized as follows: (i) germ cells, (ii) somatic \n\ncells, and (iii) stem cells. Germ cells are cells that give rise to gametes, male and female. Somatic cells \n\nare the specialized ones and make-up the adult body. In their differentiated state they may possess one \n\nor more copies of the genome, with the exception of erythrocytes which do not possess any. Finally, \n\nstem cells can be defined as cells that possess the capacity of divide indefinitely (proliferate) in culture \n\nand potentially may also differentiate into functionally distinct lineages [233]. Stem cells can be grouped \n\naccording to the source or tissue of origin. Alternatively, they can also be classified for their capacity of \n\ndifferentiation or \u201ccell plasticity\u201d as: (i) totipotent, i.e. can differentiate in all types of specialized cells of \n\nthe body, including entire fetus and placenta; (ii) pluripotent, i.e. can differentiate in several cells types of \n\nall three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm), but not the whole organism; (iii) multipotent, \n\ni.e. can only differentiate in limited type of specialized cells; and (iv) unipotent, i.e. can only give rise to \n\none differential cell lineage.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 32 - \n \n\nDue to the limited regenerative capacity of the body, there is the need for developing more effective \n\ntreatments to cure the several spontaneous and injuries-related diseases. It is well known that in \n\nmammalian tissue repair mechanisms results from the activation of pre-existing stem cells or \n\nprogenitors cells. Moreover, the identification of several stem cells sources and their isolation promise to \n\nrevolutionize the concept of regenerative medicine, since allows us to develop numerous cell-based \n\ntherapies.  \n\nIn the early 1990s, Langer and Vacanti [234]  coined TE as \u2018\u2018an interdisciplinary field of research that \n\napplies the principles of engineering and the life sciences towards the development of biological \n\nsubstitutes that restore, maintain, or improve tissue function\u2019\u2019. This concept is based on understanding \n\nof how tissue formation and regeneration occurs, and instead of traditional implantation of new spare \n\nparts it envisions to induce new functional tissues. To accomplish this goal, three main therapeutic \n\nstrategies have been proposed [235]: (i) implantation at injury site of freshly isolated cells (e.g. own \n\npatient cells) or cultured cells (differentiated cells alone or in combination with stem cells, for example); \n\n(ii) in situ tissue regeneration, i.e. implantation of a scaffold at the diseased/damaged tissue aimed at \n\npromote healing/repair by the patients own cells;  and (iii) implantation of tissues obtained from \n\ncombining cells and scaffolds that are cultured in vitro with or without the presence of bioactive \n\nmolecules. Thus, the basic TE triad consists of cells, scaffolds and bioactive agents which can be used \n\nseparately or in combination. By its turn, regenerative medicine uses the cell and tissue engineering \n\nprinciples for the regeneration of damaged/disead body tissues.  \n\nFor cell therapy, either differentiated (e.g. autologous chondrocytes) [236] or undifferentiated (e.g. stem \n\ncells) cells [233,237] can be used. Despite, the use of stem cells in clinical practice is still limited since \n\nraises many problems and concerns, specially a sub-type of stem cells, the embryonic stem (ES) cells. \n\nThis problematic is not only due to ethical/religious issues [238,239], safety [240,241] or technical limitations, \n\nbut also to the legislative/regulatory constraints [233,242]. Adult stem cells are seen as an alternative to ES \n\ncells, as their clinical use seems to be safe, without complications and major ethical issues concerns \n\n[243,244]. Stem cells can proliferate and differentiate beyond the tissues in which they normally reside or \n\nmay be artificially placed [245]. In fact, it has been shown that bone marrow-derived stem cells cannot \n\nonly reconstitute bone marrow but are capable of forming several types of mesenchymal tissues, \n\nincluding bone [246], muscle cells [247], lung and gut [248]. For example, cell sheet transplantation has been \n\nproving to be a breakthrough therapeutic strategy for treatment myocardial infarction [249], among others.  \n\nThe intensive research efforts and technological advances allowed to identify and isolate different types \n\nof stem cells from germ cells, embryo, fetus (e.g. fetal blood, placenta and umbilical cord blood), and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 33 - \n\n \n\nadult tissues and organs [250-255]. In addition, it was reported the isolation of stem cells derived from \n\namniotic fluid that express embryonic and adult stem cell markers [256]. The amniotic fluid-derived stem \n\ncells were found to be pluripotent, meaning that has the potential to differentiate into cell types \n\nrepresenting each embryonic germ layer, including cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, \n\nendothelial, neuronal and hepatic lineages. \n\nInterestingly, differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state by transfer of nuclear \n\ncontents into oocytes, by fusion with ES cells, and for male germ cells by cell culture alone. Recently, \n\nTakahashi and Yamanaka [257,258] demonstrated that pluripotent stem cells can be directly generated \n\nfrom fibroblast cultures, the so-called induced pluripotent stem (iPs) cells by retrovirus-mediated \n\ntransfection with four transcription factors, namely Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, under ES cell culture \n\nconditions. The four factors, however, can not fully explain iPs cell induction [259]. Though, this step \n\nfurther has major implications in regenerative medicine as for the first time, it is possible to create \n\npluripotent cells directly from somatic cells of humans [260]. \n\nFor in situ tissue regeneration and tissue implantation there is the need to use temporary matrices for \n\ntissue growth, the so-called scaffolds [261,262]. Though, as stressed by different authors [263,264] the \n\nstrategy to implant cells with scaffolds (constructs) is oftenly considered wiser, as it allow a rapid and \n\ncorrect vascularization of the tissue to be repaired. Scaffolds with special design [265], tunable \n\ndegradability and mechanical properties [266,267], biocompatible and capable of sustaining dense \n\npopulations of cells [268,269] are being developed. The role of the scaffold is temporary, but crucial to the \n\nsuccess of the therapeutic strategy. Thus, the criterious selection of a biomaterial is of major \n\nimportance. Synthetic biomaterials have been processed in a variety of matrices [270-272], other used for \n\ntheir bioactive ability [273], and new cell-scaffold constructs strategies [274,275] are being designed to allow \n\nthe development of biological and mechanically functional artificial tissues/organs.  \n\nScaffolds architecture, namely porosity, pore size and interconnectivity of the biomaterial scaffolds are \n\nalso known to play a critical role in tissue formation [276]. However, the balanced porosity/mechanical \n\nperformance of the scaffolds is an issue that cannot be forgotten, and thus should also be exploited \n\nfurther.  \n\nSurface properties of the scaffolds also dictate the response of cells and possibly tunning cell behaviour, \n\nand promote cell adhesion, cell orientation and cell motility [277-279], etc. Various techniques have been \n\nused to fabricate micropatterned surfaces of different materials, including microlithography [280], \n\nmicrocontact printing [281,282], and many others. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 34 - \n \n\nGrowth factors (GFs) and other bioactive molecules may be provided to control the cellular functions \n\neither from culture media [283,284] or simply by incorporation into the scaffold [285,286] which can be more \n\nadvantageous. The cells on their scaffold need to be typically cultured in custom-designed bioreactors \n\n[236,287] as mechanical forces may be required [288,289], either through fluid stresses or structural stresses, \n\nin order to provide further stimuli to cell function. Quite oftenly, this process may take days or weeks \n\nuntil it forms a tissue similar to that aimed at repair/regenerate. With simple tissues only one cell type \n\nmay be involved (e.g. chondrocytes in cartilage repair), but in other situations, more than one cell type \n\nmay be needed, as tissue to be regenerated consists of multiple structures (e.g. osteochondral tissues) \n\n[290,291]. Thus, this will require considerable sophistication with respect to the bioreactor system itself. To \n\nachieve superior tissue formation in vitro, great efforts have been made to develop and improve a wide \n\nvariety of bioreactors, including  spinner flasks [292,293], recirculation bioreactors [294,295], rotating wall \n\nvessels (e.g. uni- and bi-axial bioreactor rotation) [296-298], among others. \n\n3.2.2. Dendrimers and dendronized polymers in TE \n\nThe use of dendrimers architectures in cells and TE applications is still in its infancy. Few examples \n\nhave been reported, and these are mainly related with applications in cell adhesion studies as \n\nnanopatterning [299]. Interestingly, ligand-modified dendrimers have been proposed for use as \n\nsubstratum for cell culture and high performance  bioartificial  organs [300]. \n\nOn the other hand, it has been reported [87] that when a dendrimer reaches a certain generation (a \n\nvariable factor according to the dendritic structure but in general equal to or greater than G4), significant \n\nconformational change occurs, and the structure assumes a densely packed globular shape. Several \n\nauthors [79,87,301] have been discussing the potential of tunning dendrimers to develop macromolecules \n\nthat can mimic globular proteins. In fact, partial core shell-filled tecto(dendrimers) can be obtained by \n\ncovalently assembling PAMAM dendrimers (nucleophilic or electrophilic) around other electrophilic or \n\nnucleophilic core dendrimers [302]. This feature allows many new technological applications. One \n\npossibility is to take advantage of dendrimer architecture towards resembling the role of different \n\nproteins in the cells culture media. For example, dendrimers may be a valuable tool on the development \n\nof synthetic serum-free culture media and adequate substratum for superior cell culturing. Fluorescence \n\nspectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and fluorescent probes studies [303,304] showed that \n\ndendrimers interact with proteins giving rise to stable complexes by establishing both electrostatic and \n\nnon-electrostatic interactions.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 35 - \n\n \n\nKim et al. [305] have also investigated the response of human epithelial cells to dendrimer-immobilized \n\nsubstrates with or without D-glucose displayed as a terminal ligand. When the topographic surface \n\npossessed a roughness of 4 nm epithelial cells cultured on naked dendrimer surface without D-glucose \n\nwere somewhat stretched in their morphology compared with those on a nonmodified plain surface. \n\nHowever, for the roughness values higher than 4 nm cell stretching was inhibited, thus resulting in the \n\npredominant existence of round-shaped cells. The change in cell morphology was quite evident on the \n\nsurfaces with D-glucose-displayed dendrimers. Fluorescence microscopic observation showed that \n\nwhen the roughness value increased up to 4.5 nm on these surfaces, an enhancement of cell stretching \n\noccurs. These results suggested that surface roughness and D-glucose display induce changes in \n\ncellular morphology caused by the cytoskeleton formation accompanied by marked cell elongation. \n\nTherefore, this study demonstrated that dendrimer surfaces can offer a promising design for optimizing \n\ncells culture conditions. \n\nIn the work reported by Benhabbour and colleagues [306], it was demonstrated that cells showed a \n\ngreater affinity for the dendronized surfaces as compared to the Au surfaces (control). Moreover, in vitro \n\ncell culture studies with mouse 3T3 fibroblasts showed that cell attachment was diminished for the PEG-\n\ngrafted Au surfaces as compared to the control Au and G1-G4 dendronized surfaces. These results \n\nshowed that dendronized surfaces presenting a large number of hydroxyl groups can be a reliable \n\nalternative to the use of peptides to promote cell adhesion and proliferation. \n\n3.2.2.1. Bone TE \n\nBone is a very dense and specialized form of connective tissue, highly specialized in the several regions \n\nthat constitutes it and acts as a support for the body. Bone lesions above a critical-sized segmental \n\ndefect still remain a huge challenge to reconstructive surgery and regenerative medicine. This is mainly \n\ndue to the fact that bone has a limited ability to heal [307,308]. In many clinical situations there is the need \n\nfor a surgical intervention and use of autografts [309,310], allografts or xenografts [310,311] transplantation. \n\nStill, the preferred clinical strategy is the autologous transplantation, since it avoids the problem of \n\nimmune rejection [312] and consequent administration of drugs for immunosupression of the host [313]. \n\nTherefore, we can state that the currently available treatment possibilities are far from being a truly ideal \n\nsolution. Recently, it has been applied the TE principles [314], i.e. by seeding bone marrow stem cells \n\nonto scaffolds (constructs) [315] or prostheses [316] to recreate an regenerative environment at the defect \n\narea and achieve a superior bone healing. Despite the important advances, the performance of \n\nconstructs remains limited, in part due to the need of optimize cell culture techniques [317]. To circumvent \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 36 - \n \n\nthese limitations great efforts are focused on developing novel nanocarriers aimed at modulate cells \n\nbehaviour. Previously, our group [184] has investigated investigated if the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles can play a crucial role in the regulation of osteogenesis, in vitro. In this work, \n\nthe uptake efficiency and mechanism of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles using rat \n\nbone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) was investigated. Fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that \n\nthe developed nanocariers could be efficiently internalized by RBMSCs, after a few hours (Figure 7). \n\nFlow cytometry studies revealed that RBMSCs cultured in the presence of colchicine, an endocytotic \n\ninhibitor, reduce the internalization of the nanoparticles. These data showed that uptake by cells was \n\nprimarily via an active endocytosis mechanism, but not exclusively. Moreover, the biochemical data \n\ndemonstrated that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were not cytotoxic and \n\npromote osteogenesis (2-D system).  \n\n50 ?m\n\n \n\nFigure 7.

Nuclear DNA and cytoskeleton were \n\nlabeled with Hoechst 33258 (blue) and Texas-Red phalloidin (red), respectively. \n\nRecent studies [318,319] have shown that combination of hydroxyapatite (HAp) scaffolds, bone marrow \n\nstromal cells and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer enhanced osteogenesis in vitro (3-D systems), \n\nand de novo bone formation as compared to controls, in vivo (Figure 8). Remarkably, animal studies \n\nhave shown that the novel Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may be beneficial as \n\nintracellular nanocarrier, supplying Dex in a regimented manner, while avoiding the need of culturing the \n\ncells in vitro for long periods of time. Moreover, this strategy allows modulate and direct stem cells \n\ndifferentiation towards the osteogenic phenotype, and enhance in vivo proteoglycan ECM synthesis and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.

In fact, photopolymerized dendritic copolymers and \n\nparticulate filler composites have been combined to be used as dental restorative materials [321]. In that \n\nstudy, dendritic monomers were found to enhance the copolymerization of methyl methacrylate and to \n\nlower the viscosity, which can be advantegous to improve biocompatibility of the fillers.  \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

Cartilage TE \n\nIn the human body, it can be found two main types of cartilage, namelly the \u201cunstressed\u201d and \u201cstressed\u201d \n\ncartilage, in ear and joints, respectively. General features of cartilage tissue includes: (i) a small number \n\nof chondrocytes (less than 10% of the weight of articular cartilage) with low proliferation rate and having \n\nboth catabolic and anabolic functions; (ii) a high content of water (75% of the wet weight of articular \n\ncartilage); (iii) an abundant ECM composed by proteoglycan and different types of collagens (mainly \n\ntype II), corresponding to 15-30 and 50-73% of the solid ECM weight, respectively; and (iv) possess no \n\nnerve and vascular systems [322,323]. Although a classical wound healing response is initiated, articular \n\ncartilage lesions are repaired without complete restoration of the components and architecture of the \n\nFFF\n\nSSS\n\nNNN BBB\n\n?\n\n***\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 38 - \n \n\nnative tissue. This is explained by the fact of being an avascular tissue, regenerative cells cannot \n\nmigrate to the defect void unless the lesion goes beyond the subchondral bone plate [324,325]. Therefore, \n\na regenerative response will be only possible when it is provided an artificial access by the marrow [326]. \n\nThis consideration is subjacent on several clinical strategies that are currently employed on the \n\ntreatment of small cartilage lesions namely, the subchondral abrasion, Pridie\u2019s perforations, micro-\n\nfracture, and transplantation of osteochondral plugs [325,327-329]. Although, in most cases after clinical \n\nintervention the repaired tissue tends to degenerate and occur the formation of the undesired \n\nfibrocartilage [324,330,331]. Many attempts have been made to develop biomaterials for cartilage \n\nrepair/regeneration. Few have exploited the advantages of dendrimers for this type of applications. \n\nSontjens and colleagues [332] have synthesized a photocrosslinkable hydrogel scaffold for cartilage \n\nrepair based on triblock copolymer consisting of PEG core and methacrylated-poly(glycerol-succinic \n\nacid) (PLGSA) terminal blocks. In vitro chondrocyte encapsulation studies demonstrated that the \n\ndeveloped hydrogels supported synthesis of proteoglycans and type II collagen, which denote \n\ncartilaginous extracellular matrix formation. Morever, encapsulated chondrocytes showed no signs of \n\ndedifferentiation. Despite the promising results in vitro, the authors discussed the need to improve \n\nmechanical properties and tailor the degradation rate of the developed hydrogels for the superior \n\nperformance of the hydrogels, in vivo.  \n\n3.2.2.3. Ocular wounds \n\nAnother example of dendrimer applications in TE is related with the attempts to improve the biological \n\nresponse of different biomaterials. In another study [42], laminin-based peptide YIGSR was introduced \n\ninto the dendrimer-collagen hydrogel by linking the peptide to the residual dendrimer amine groups. The \n\nincorporated YIGSR peptide promoted the adhesion and proliferation of the corneal epithelial cells \n\ncultures onto the collagen hydrogel, in vitro. Moreover, neurite extension and nerve cell density was \n\nenhanced on these materials relative to unmodified gels or controls. This work is an unprecedented \n\nexample of the ability to tune the biological function through the dendrimer crosslinker and a new \n\nstrategy towards obtaining polymer-based tissue-engineering scaffolds with improved biological \n\nperformance.  \n\nInspired by the functional significance of collagen in nature and its remarkable physiological roles, Khew \n\net al. [333] have developed enzymatically crosslinked collagen-mimetic dendrimers. These were obtained \n\nin two-step procedure: (i) collagen-mimetic peptides supplemented with a cell-binding sequence \n\n(GFOGER) and enzyme-specific crosslinking domains (EDGFFKI and APQQEA) were conjugated onto \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 39 - \n\n \n\na PAMAM dendrimers (G2), resulting in a crosslinkable collagen-mimetic dendrimer, and (ii) enzyme-\n\nmediated crosslinking the different collagen-mimetic dendrimers by tissue transglutaminase. Collagen-\n\nmimetic dendrimers were first assessed for their cytotoxicity and then adhesion studies were carried out \n\nusing L929 mouse fibroblasts and a hepatoma cell line (Hep3B cells), respectively. Results were \n\nindicative of the non-cytotoxic nature of the polymers. The adhesion studies have proven that enzymatic \n\nprotein crosslinking, which is a common physiological event in the extracellular environment, can \n\nsignificantly improve cell adhesion on the novel collagen-like biomaterial. Moreover, it was observed that \n\ncombining of collagen-like structural domain and biologically relevant epitopes (e.g. cell-binding \n\nsequence and enzyme-substrates) into the molecular design of a biomimetic collagen could be a \n\npromising approach for mimicking more closely its biological function. \n\nRepair of wounds after traumatic or surgical injury is of significant clinical and research importance. For \n\nexample, corneal wounds arise from surgical procedures (e.g. transplants, incisions for cataract removal \n\nand intraocular lens implantation, laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis), infections (ulcers), and traumatic \n\ninjury (lacerations, perforations). Nowadays, these wounds are repaired using nylon sutures but this \n\ntechnique is not ideal because the suture material does not actively participate in healing and the \n\nprocedure is inherently invasive. Therefore, alternative strategies using adhesive polymers have been \n\ntested. For example, Duan et al. [334] crosslinked collagen with multifunctional dendrimers. PPI \n\noctaamine dendrimers (G2) were used to generate highly crosslinked collagen hydrogels with \n\nmechanical properties that would make it appropriate for use as a corneal TE scaffold.  \n\nFor the superior performance of ocular wounds, hydrogel adhesives should meet some criteria, namely: \n\n(i) adhere to the moist corneal surface and seal the wound to withstand high intraocular pressures; (ii) \n\npossess adequate rheological properties to permit a controlled and rapid placement; (iii) ability to seal \n\nthe corneal wound in a controlled manner and restore the intraocular pressure; (iv) maintain the \n\nstructural integrity of the eye and possess a refractive properties resembling as much as possible to \n\nnative cornea; (v) be biocompatible and provide a microbial barrier; and (vi) be biodegraded or \n\nbioabsorbed on a time scale consistent with tissue regeneration.  \n\nGrinstaff and coworkers [335] have developed a set of dendrimeric adhesives composed of dendrimers of \n\ndifferent generation (G1, G2 G3) combined with PEG, glycerol, and succinic acid for finding application \n\nin the repair of corneal wounds. The polymer was modified to contain terminal methacrylate (MA) \n\ngroups, [G1]-PGLSA-MA)2-PEG. Two strategies to develop the ocular adhesives were explored: (i) the \n\nuse of a photocrosslinking reaction to form the dendrimer-PGLSA-MA)2-PEG, and (ii) the use a peptide \n\nligation reaction to couple the individual dendrimers together to form the lysine-based dendron with \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 40 - \n \n\nterminal cysteines adhesive hydrogel G2-(Lys)3-Cys4) and PEG-dialdehyde (PEG-DA). Both strategies \n\nstrategies afford hydrogels that are adhesive, transparent, elastic, hydrophilic, and soft. The in vivo \n\nstudies in chicken eyes have shown that the photocrosslinkable ([G1]-PGLSA-MA)2-PEG adhesive \n\ncompletely sealed the linear lacerations on post-operative day. By its turn, the histological studies \n\ndemonstrated that wounds sealed with these adhesive gels appeared to be more complete as \n\ncompared to sutured wounds, after 28 days. By its turn, the dendron ([G2]-(Lys)3-Cys4) and PEG-DA \n\nshow to be effective on the repair of corneal lacerations and required less surgical time than \n\nconventional suturing, ex vivo. The advantage of the photocrosslinked gels lies on the ability of the \n\npolymer to crosslink and adhere to the tissue where the clinician directs the light. However, the limitation \n\nis the potential risks with ocular damage when using light. Thus, the crosslinking strategy based on \n\npeptide bonding show to be more attractive since it can avoid the need for light and the reaction is \n\nperformed at neutral pH; thus the polymer can be crosslinked upon placement on the tissue. \n\n3.2.2.4. Diagnosis and inflammation \n\nIn autograft transplantation, biopsies are performed harvesting the smallest amount of tissue possible \n\nfrom patients to prepare starter cells. Oftenly, tissue is lised and cells are expanded. During culturing \n\nchanges in intracellular states can cause variation in individuality in a cell population and cells behavior. \n\nMoreover, due to terminal differentiation cellular senescence can occur. Therefore, there is the need to \n\ninvestigate the cellular status, prior implantation into the patient. In this context, Hata el al. [336] have \n\nproposed a novel image analysis methodology based on the observation of the partial anchoring of the \n\ncells to a glucose-dendrimer immobilized culture surface as a mean to evaluate the formation of the \n\ncellular cytoskeleton in a non-invasive manner. In this study, formation of the cellular cytoskeleton was \n\ncorrelated with the growth cellular potential. This innovative method allowed observation of the cells \n\nmorphology, and conclude on the regenerative potential of the cells to be used in TE strategies. \n\nIn the last few years, there has been a great interest [337,338] in the mediators responsible for the \n\nselective recruitment and activation of immune cells at inflammatory site. Among these mediators, \n\nchemokines have received particular attention in in vivo studies involving the investigation of cytokine-\n\nassociated responses to biomaterials [234]. Chemokines are a large family of small (7,000-15,000 Da, \n\nfrom 67 to 127 amino acids in length), structurally related heparin-binding proteins, which are classified \n\ninto 4 subfamilies according to the configuration of cysteine residues near the N-terminus, depending on \n\nwhether the first 2 cysteines are separated (CXC, CX3C) or not (CC, C) by an intervening amino acid \n\n[339]. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 41 - \n\n \n\nChemokine messages are decoded by specific receptors [340-342] that initiate signal transduction events, \n\nleading to a multitude of cellular responses, including chemotaxis and activation of inflammatory and \n\nbone cells. Thus, the development of synthetic chemoattractants by linking small peptide sequences \n\nthat are known to interact with chemokine receptors to dendrimers and, when appropriate, chemokine \n\ninhibitors [343] can be envisioned. In regenerative medicine, the development of dendrimer-based \n\nchemoattractants can find interesting applications towards recruiting stem cells [344]. This unexploited \n\narea can open up new therapeutic avenues, not only for treating autoimmune diseases but also, to be \n\nused in innovative TE strategies, since it can lead to the superior repair/regeneration of \n\ndamaged/diseased tissues by endogenous cells.  \n\n3.3. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS  \n\nIn spite of deeply studied, the brain and the central nervous system (CNS)  still encase many mysteries, \n\nand therefore its pathologies still represent a major challenge for biomedical science.  \n\nNeurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, stroke, brain tumours or \n\nmultiple sclerosis (MS) are among leading debilitating diseases within our society to which a feasible \n\nand long lasting therapeutic approach is yet to be found. In the next lines we will give a short overview \n\non the CNS properties, as well as how drug delivery systems, and in particular dendrimers, may be \n\nused to develop strategies that hinder some of the symptoms of the above referred therapies.  \n\n3.3.1. The central nervous system: basic concepts \n\nThe nervous system is structurally divided in two sections [345,346]: (i) central nervous system, and (ii) \n\nperipheric nervous system (PNS). The first is constituted by the brain and spinal cord, and is considered \n\nto be the \u201ccommand post\u201d of the nervous system. It is responsible for the interpretation and processing \n\nof the information that is hand over by the PNS, which is constituted by an array of nerves, that  are \n\nspread out through the body and connected to the spinal cord,  and have as main function to gather \n\ninformation from the outer/inner environment. In this sense the spinal cord can be looked as an \n\ninformation \u201chighway\u201d transmitting information from and into the brain, playing therefore a leading role \n\non the normal functioning of the CNS. \n\nFrom the cell biology point of view the CNS is composed of two cell types, neurons and glial cells.    \n\nNeurons are considered to be the structural and functional unit of the CNS. Its main characteristic is \n\nbased on the ability to respond and conduct electrochemical impulses, being their actions mainly \n\nmediated through the release of chemical regulators known as neurotransmitters [346,347]. Although \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 42 - \n \n\nneurons can considerably change in shape and size, they are normally divided in three areas: the cell \n\nbody or soma, dendrites and the axons [346].  The cell body, as its name implies is the area where all \n\nnucleus and the remaining organelles are located, and therefore is considered as the \u201cnutritional centre\u201d \n\nof the neuron, as it is the place where macromolecules found to be essential to neuronal survival are \n\nproduced [348]. The dendrites can be looked as extensions of the cell body that provide an extended \n\nsurface area for the reception of the nervous impulses, transmitted by neighbouring neurons, to the cell \n\nbodies [347]. Finally, the axon can also be looked as an extension protruding from the cell body, although \n\nmuch more differentiated than the dendrites. It is through this structure that the nervous impulses are \n\nconducted from the cell body to the axon terminals, where neurotransmitters will be released to adjacent \n\nneurons to an area denominated as synaptic cleft [346,347]. The axon is normally surrounded by a \n\nlipoproteic sheath of myelin. The latter acts mainly as an electric insulator, allowing in this sense a faster \n\ntransmission of the nervous impulse. The areas of the brain that are rich in myelinated fibers are known \n\nas white matter while the areas containing the cell bodies are known as grey matter [346,347]. \n\nThe glial cells are the second cell type of the central nervous system. They are more abundant than the \n\nneurons. Glial cells are mainly involved in supporting functions, such as the maintenance of the ionic \n\nbalance of neurons, the modulation of the synaptic transmission and the re-establishment of the \n\nneurological function upon neuronal damage, although, this is not always possible, as in the case of \n\nspinal cord injury (SCI). Three cell populations can be found among glial cells [346]: (i) astrocytes, (ii) \n\noligodendrocytes, and (iii) microglial cells. \n\nAstrocytes are the most abundant glial cell type. They are commonly located in the vicinities of blood \n\nvessels and neurons, and are, among others, responsible for mediating the synaptic transmission by \n\nremoving, from the synaptic cleft, neurotransmitters that will be later on \u201crecycled\u201d and made available \n\nagain to neurons.  \n\nOligodendrocytes are the cells involved on the production of the myelin sheath, that encases the \n\nneurons, and thus are of the utmost importance within the CNS [345]. \n\nMicroglial cells play an important role within the CNS, as they are considered to be the immune \n\nmediators of the latter, possessing a macrophage-like behaviour, eliminating death tissue and cells by \n\nphagocytosis, as well foreign agents. They possess two states, which mainly reflect their state of \n\nactivation. Ramified microglial cells are considered to be in the resting state. They are characterized by \n\npossessing long cytoplasmastic processes, a small cell body and few lysosomes. On the other hand \n\nactivated microglia is characterized by ameboid morphology, with a large cell body and a large number \n\nof lysosomes, which indicates a high phagocytotic capacity [349]. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 43 - \n\n \n\n3.3.2. Blood brain barrier (BBB) \n\nThe brain is protected from the rest of the body by structures known as barriers that most oftenly \n\nrepresent a major hurdle for the delivery of diagnostic and therapeutic agents [350]. In fact most of the \n\nsystemically administered drugs do not enter the brain in adequate amounts, which most of the times \n\nleads to an increase of dosage that can lead to undesirable side effects. The most well known barrier is \n\nthe BBB, which consists of \u201cwalls\u201d of capillaries that separate brain from the circulating blood [350]. Its low \n\npermeability is mostly attributed to brain micro-vessel endothelial (BMVEC) cells which form tight \n\njunctions and have a low pinocytic potential [350-353]. Moreover, the BBB is also formed by astrocytic \n\nprocesses, leptomeningeal cells and a parenchymal membrane that overall isolate the brain from \n\nunwanted molecules [350]. However, not all molecules are \u201cunwanted\u201d by the BBB. For instance, the \n\nlatter provides for selective transport of small molecules, lipophilic and low molecular weight \n\ncompounds, polypeptides ad even cells to the CNS. In particular, nutrients and endogenous compounds \n\nsuch as amino acids, glucose, essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, electrolytes' are effectively \n\ncarried by the BBB. Most of these processes are based on receptor-mediated endocytosis [351]. \n\nReceptors such as insulin, transferrin, endothelial growth factors, amino acids, glucose (GLUT 1) \n\ntransporter are known to be expressed by the BBB, for example [351]. In this sense the BBB can be seen \n\nas regulatory membrane, which selectively allows the passage of essential molecules to the \n\nhomeostasis of the CNS, while inhibiting what is believed to be \u201charmful\u201d ones. Thus, when designing a \n\nstrategy to deliver a therapeutic agent into the CNS one must understand the properties of the BBB in \n\norder to allow an efficient delivery nanocarrier to the target site (s). \n\n3.3.3. Dendrimers and dendronized polymers in CNS   \n\nAs referred before drug delivery to the CNS is tremendously challenging. Initially films, tablets, \n\nmicrospheres and intracranial polymeric materials were tested for these applications. However, as \n\nrecently reviewed by Kabanov and Gendelman [350], such strategies had limited success namely due to \n\ntheir invasiveness, inflammatory responses to implants and limited distribution of therapeutic molecules \n\naround the implantation site. It was in this context that nanomedicine based approaches started to be \n\nput forward as a possible solution. Within these one can found liposome\u2019s [354,355], polymeric \n\nnanoparticles [356,357], and nanogels [358]. Particularly interesting for the above referred applications are \n\nalso dendrimers [359]. Surprisingly, their application to the CNS is also still quite scarce. Nevertheless, \n\nsome nice examples can be drawn from the literature of the possible applications of these systems for \n\ndrug delivery in the CNS. For instance Suppatone and co-workers [360,361] suggested the use of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 44 - \n \n\ndendrimers for the removal of prion effection. In a couple of studies it was reported that branched \n\npolyamines, including PAMAM, PPI and  PEI dendrimers, were able to purge PrPSc, the protease-\n\nresistant isoform of the prion protein, from scrapie-infected neuroblastoma (ScN2a) cells in culture. The \n\nremoval of PrPSc by these compounds depended mainly on both the concentration of branched \n\npolymer and the duration of exposure. Structure-activity analysis revealed that a high surface density of \n\nprimary amino groups was required for polyamines to eliminate PrPSc effectively from cells. In a \n\nsubsequent study it was also demonstrated that exposure of ScN2a cells to 3 mg.mL-1 of PPI (G4) for 4 \n\nweeks not only reduced PrPSc to a level undetectable by Western blot but also eradicated prion \n\ninfectivity as determined by  bioassays  in mice. Moreover exposure of purified RML prions to branched \n\npolyamines in vitro disaggregated the prion rods, reduced the ?-sheet content of PrP 27-30, and \n\nrendered PrP 27-30 susceptible to proteolysis. \n\nCationic phoshorous dendrimers have also been proposed for the same applications, also through \n\ninhibition of fibril assembly [362].  Spectrofluorometric assays with thioflavin T (ThT) and Fourier \n\ntransformed infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy show that these class of phosphorous dendrimers were able \n\nto clearly interfere with PrP 185-208 aggregation process by both slowing down the formation of \n\naggregates (by causing a decrease of the nucleation rate) and by lowering the final amount of amyloid \n\nfibrils, a common hallmark of conformational diseases. In fact, time-course experiments demonstrated \n\nthat phosphorus dendrimers were able to remove quickly existing PrPSc molecules and the clearance \n\noccurred within 4 hours of treatment [115]. The mechanism behind these actions is mostly unknown. \n\nHowever, similarly to what happens with PAMAM dendrimers, the breakage of oligomers or whole fibrils \n\ncaused by dendrimers has probably a strong role on the observed phenomena. A similar report was \n\nalso put forward by Klajnert et al. [114]. In this particular study, PAMAM dendrimers (G3) were used to \n\ncontrol the nucleation rate of amyloid plaques. The outcome of these studies revealed that dendrimers \n\ncan modulate the aggregation process by affecting the nucleation rate at low concentrations. However, \n\nat higher concentrations it seemed that dendrimers promoted the elongation of this nucleation chains. \n\nTherefore, the interest in the reported effect of dendrimers has to be considered within the ongoing \n\nsearch for compounds that can affect amyloid formation and in relation to the structural intermediates in \n\nthis process which are responsible for the cytotoxic effects. In this sense low dendrimer concentrations \n\ncould contribute to a decrease of the lifetime of low molecular weight intermediates and contribute to \n\ndecrease the potential cytotoxic effects of the peptides. For instance Patel et al. [363] described the use \n\nof modified PAMAM dendrimers for Alzheimers' disease. In this particular case sialic-acid-conjugated \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 45 - \n\n \n\nPAMAM dendrimers using a physiologically relevant attachment of the sialic acid to the dendrimeric \n\ntermini were prepared. \n\nAnother route to use dendrimers for CNS related applications, namely for transfection purposes, is by \n\ncoating the latter with specific peptides. An example of such an approach was the one presented by Kim \n\nand colleagues [364,365], in which arginine-grafted PAMAM dendrimers were used. In this case these \n\nPAMAM-Arg dendrimers were complexed with expression of both a reporter gene (luciferase expression \n\nplasmid pCN-Luci) and a high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) shRNA transgene-expressing plasmid for \n\ngene knock down. Results revealed that these PAMAM-Arg/DNA complexes showed particularly high \n\ntransfection efficiencies and low cytotoxicity in primary cortical cells, as compared to other gene carriers \n\nsuch as native PAMAM. \n\nOther classes of dendrimers have also been purposed for CNS regenerative medicine, such as those \n\nbased on polyesters. In a report put forward by Dhanikula and colleagues [195,359] it was suggested the \n\nuse of polyether-copolyester (PEPE) dendrimers conjugated with D-glucosamine and loaded with \n\nmethotrexate (MTX), in order to allow a better delivery across the BBB. Results revealed that the \n\nefficacy of MTX-loaded dendrimers was established against U87 MG and U 343 MGa cells (two glioma \n\ncell lines). In vitro studies revealed that glucosylated dendrimers were found to be endocytosed in \n\nsignificantly higher amounts than nonglucosylated dendrimers by both the cell lines. Moreover, the \n\namount of MTX-transported across an in vitro model of the BBB was three to five times more after \n\nloading in the dendrimers, which indicates that glucosylation further increased the cumulative \n\npermeation of dendrimers across BBB and hence increased the amount of MTX available across it. This \n\nwork showed a different set of dendrimers as well as different strategy to potentate their delivery across \n\nthe BBB. However, it should be looked with caution as only in vitro models were used and therefore the \n\nin vivo proof of concept is yet to be demonstrated. A similar strategy (e.g. cell targeted particles) was \n\nfollowed by Wu et al.  [366], which have developed a vehicle for boron neutron capture therapy (BNTC), \n\ninstead of MTX. Similarly to what happened before a heavily boronated PAMAM dendrimer was \n\nchemically linked to C225 by means of the heterobifunctional reagents N-succinimidyl 3-(2-\n\npyridyldithio)-propionate and N-(k-maleimido undecanoic acid)-hydrazide. Initial in vitro studies revealed \n\nthat the already mentioned F98EGFR glioma cells specifically internalize the particles when compared \n\nto receptor negative F98 wild-type cells. Further in vivo studies were conducted by stereotactically \n\nimplanting F98EGFR cells into the brains of Fischer rats. The targeted boronated dendrimers were \n\nadministered 14 days after either convection enhanced delivery (CED) or direct intratumoral (i.t.) \n\ninjection. Results revealed that not only the targeted dendrimers were receptor specific in vivo, but that \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 46 - \n \n\nalso animals that were exposed to the tested therapy disclose higher survival rated when compared to \n\ncontrols. In this sense it appears that this strategy for using dendrimers as targeted particles for \n\ntherapeutic usage is more favorable than the former. Another in vitro study [367] described yet another \n\nset of polyester based dendrimers denominated as PLGSA. The results reported are quite scarce \n\nregarding CNS applications, but still it was demonstrated that these dendrimers could encapsulate \n\ncamptothecins and could be internalize by glioblastoma cells (SF-268 cell line). Finally, another study \n\n[368] suggested a possible source of delivery vehicles based on dendrimers denominated as \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. Experiments with post-natal hippocampal neurons and \n\ncortical glial cells revealed that both cell populations were able to taken up the CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles. The internalization rates changed according to the cell populations, reaching a \n\nmaximum peak after 48 hours of incubation. Overall astrocytes and microglial cells disclosed higher \n\ninternalization rates (around 100% of the total cell sub-population) followed by neurons and \n\noligodendrocytes (up to 80-90% of the observed cells). Further experiments for periods of up to 7 days \n\nrevealed that the periodical addition of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was needed to maintain \n\nthe levels of internalization. Finally it was also observed that cell viability and proliferation were not \n\nsignificantly affected by the presence of the above referred nanoparticles.  These results were quite \n\npromising, but similarly to what it was described for other studies herein described, further in vivo proof \n\nof concept needs to be done. \n\n3.4. GENE DELIVERY APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS \n\nThe  ability  to  transfer  genetic  material efficiently,  into  the  nucleus  and  cytoplasm  of eukaryotic  \n\ncells  may  allow  treatment  of  a  variety  of  genetic  disorders.  There are two types of vectors to gene \n\ndelivery: (i) viral and (ii) non-viral. Viral-mediated DNA vehicles (infection) have played a major role in \n\ngene therapeutics. Unfortunately, initial enthusiasm associated to the high infection yields, has been \n\ntempered by growing concerns regarding the safety issues such as toxicity, immunogenicity and \n\noncogenicity [369,370]. On the other hand, synthetic DNA delivery systems \u201ctransfection\u201d provides potential \n\nalternatives for gene therapy and DNA vaccination. Major drawback of current transfection technology is \n\nthe low efficiency compared to infection techniques, although new materials are being exploited. \n\nGenetic material  is  usually  imported  into  the  cell  by  endocytosis  where,  via  the  endosomes,  it  \n\nmay  be  transported to  lysosomes,  to  other  intracellular  membrane  compartments  or  to  the \n\ncytosol. Thus, they first reach mildly acidic endosomes (pH 5.0-6.5) and then end up in lysosomes \n\nwhere they face much lower pH conditions and possible enzymatic degradation. Therefore, the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 47 - \n\n \n\nimportance of transferring genetic material into the cytosol is an extremely important process in the \n\ndevelopment of effective gene therapies. Moreover, transport of the gene into the nucleus must occur \n\nwithout imparting damage/inactivation from the vehicle itself. This renewed the interest in pH-responsive \n\ndendrimeric nanocarriers as a mean to enable these macromolecules to reach their subcellular targets. \n\nDendrimers play a significant role in the development of non-viral vectors for gene delivery due to the \n\nhigh charge density and tunable surface functional groups, thus allowing optimize condensation and \n\nformation of nanostructures with DNA, the so-called \u201cdendriplexes\u201d. Amine-terminated PAMAM \n\ndendrimers (polycationic) can interact with negatively charged phosphate groups of nucleic acids. This \n\nensures consistent formation of transfection complexes. In fact, the transfection reagent called \n\nSuperFectTM consisting of activated dendrimers is commercially available. Activated dendrimers can \n\ncarry higher amounts of genetic material as compared to that of viruses. SuperFect-DNA complexes are \n\ncharacterised by high stability and provide more efficient transport of DNA into the nucleus than \n\nliposomes. It has been advanced that the high transfection efficiency of dendrimers may not only be due \n\nto their well-defined shape but may also be caused by the low pK of the amines (3.9 and 6.9). The low \n\npK permit the dendrimer to buffer the pH change in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment. This can be \n\nbeneficial since it can direct towards polymeric swelling, thus allowing disruting the membrane of the \n\norganelle and promoting the complex release or DNA itself. Therefore, they have an intrinsic \n\nendosomolytic escape capacity, or can mediate their escape by degradable spacers. Another \n\nadvantage is that these vectors can also prevent fast degradation of DNA by endo- and exo-nucleases. \n\nPAMAM and other cationic dendrimers such as PPI, thus fulfill these requirements. Initial work by Szoka \n\nand colleagues [371] have shown that the three dimensional spherical structure of the PAMAM \n\ndendrimers (G5) could be broken by heating and, surprisingly the fractured dendrimers led to significant \n\nenhanced transfection efficiency over naked plasmid DNA. Recently, Kim et al. [372] have proposed the \n\nuse of poly(amino ester) obtained by bulk condensation of two monomers-containing multiple reacting \n\ngroups towards obtaining a non-viral and cationic polymer-based gene delivery system. The particular \n\nfeature of this system consisted on the low cytotoxicity and slow degradation which possibly long-term \n\ntherapeutic applications.  \n\nThere are many factors affecting the efficiency of non-viral gene delivery systems. For successful gene \n\ntherapy first of all, we need that genetic material can be permanently integrated and expressed by cells. \n\nIn this context, Galetti et al. [373] have demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotides (ONs, gene-specific \n\nsequences of nucleic acids with 15 to 25 bases) directed to LMP1 mRNA, effectively suppressed LMP1 \n\ngene expression which plays a key role for growth transformation and immortalization of B lymphocytes. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 48 - \n \n\nThe efficiency of three cationic carriers on the delivery of anti-LMP1-ON to their site of action in Epstein \n\nBarr virus (EBV)-infected B lymphocytes was investigated. Results have shown that liposomes, \n\ndendrimers or transferrin-PLL-conjugated ON were internalized by the cells at an extent several fold \n\nhigher than that of the naked oligomers. Using Superfect\u00ae, a dendrimeric polycation with terminal amine \n\ngroups, a higher intracellular concentration of ON was obtained as observed by both cytofluorimetric \n\nand confocal microscopy analysis. However, there were some evidences of toxicity induced by the \n\npositively charged dendrimers on the lymphocytes\u2019 membranes and the lack of intracellular mRNA-ON \n\nduplex formation and of LMP1 mRNA degradation, indicated a failure of this carrier.  \n\nTo improve transfection efficiency, different strategies have been proposed. In this respect, Arima and \n\ncoworkers [374] prepared a novel conjugate consisting of a dendrimer (G3) with ?-cyclodextrin bearing \n\nmannose (Man-?-CDE conjugates) with various degrees of substitution of the mannose moiety. This \n\nsystem Man-?-CDE conjugate (G3, DSM10) provided the highest gene transfer activity in different cells \n\ntype and provided new insights on the cellular association of polyplex with Man-?-CDE conjugate (G3, \n\nDSM10). Results also suggested that the conjugate has less cytotoxicity and were able to escape from \n\nendosome and to be translocated into the nucleus.  \n\nLuo et al. study [375] revelead the low cytotoxicity of PEG-modified PAMAM and their efficiency on the \n\nDNA delivery. These systems were obtained using low generation dendrimers with PEG chains, which \n\nmimics the fractured high-generation dendrimers. In fact, the proposed molecules showed a 20-fold \n\nincrease in transfection efficiency as compared to that of partially degraded dendrimer controls. \n\nZhang and coworkers [376] have investigated the effect of the core structure and generation of PAMAM \n\ndendrimers on the formation and transfection efficiency of the dendriplexes. This work evaluated in vitro, \n\nthe transfection efficiency of a series of dendrimers with a trimesyl core (DT, three-arm) using COS-7 \n\ncells, HeLa cells and primary hepatocytes. Dendrimers derived from pentaerythritol (DP, four-arm) and \n\ninositol (DI, six-arm) were used for comparison. Results revealed that the minimal generation of DT for \n\ncomplex with DNA was 6, while for DP and DI was 5. Thus, the difference in core structure resulted in \n\ndifferent dendrimer flexibilities, and consequently influenced the interaction between the dendrimers and \n\nthe DNA. As expected, the optimal generation numbers at which dendrimers showed higher transgene \n\nexpression was 5 for DPs and DIs and 6 for DTs. Importantly, DT dendriplexes show higher transfection \n\nefficiency, which can be related to its buffer capacity inside the endosome.  \n\nBoussif work [377] use PEI to test its potential for gene delivery. PEI is a protonable amino nitrogen atom, \n\nwhich makes the polymeric network an effective \u2018\u2018proton sponge\u2019\u2019 at virtually any pH and can protect \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 49 - \n\n \n\nDNA from nuclease activity. The PEI/luciferase reporter gene complex was transfered into a variety of \n\ncell lines and primary cells gave results comparable to that of lipopolyamines (gold standard).  \n\nInterestingly, Dung et al. [378] have prepared deriplexes of cholesteryl dendrimers with antisense \n\noligonucleotides (5:1). These were biologically active and mediated delivery of antisense oligonucleotide \n\ninto HeLa cells in a moderate level. The enhanced delivery of the antisense oligomer into nucleus of the \n\ncells resulted in the expression of the reporter gene product, a luciferase. Thus, that work demonstrated \n\nthat the increase of hydrophobicity by the conjugation of cholesterol to dendrimer enhanced the delivery \n\nefficiency of antisense oligonucleotide into cells.  \n\nRecently, Russ et al. [379] have synthesize grafted-PPI dendrimers of PPI dendrimers (G2 and G3) by \n\nsurface modification with either oligoethylenimine (OEI) via ester-degradable or PPI dendrimer (G2). In \n\nthat study, it was investigated their potential as vectors for gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro \n\ntransfection studies with the polyplexes (surface-modified PPI dendrimers and plasmid DNA pCMVLuc-\n\nfirefly luciferase reporter gene) was carried out using both Neuro2A neuroblastoma cells (ATCC\u00ae, CCl-\n\n131) and B16F10 murine melanoma cells. Results have shown that all compounds were not cytotoxic \n\nand grafting of either G2 or G3 core units with OEI led to enhanced transfection efficiency, irrespective \n\nof the investigated core generation used. Increase of dendrimers' generation did not enhance \n\ntransfection efficiency in vitro. Prior in vivo studies, it was screened possible haemolytic activity of the \n\ncompounds. Contrarily to the previously reported PEI-induced erythrocyte aggregation, this work \n\nshowed that all developed vectors did not induce erythrocyte aggregation. In vivo, it was observe a clear \n\ninfluence of the dendrimers in the the tumor gene expression levels, i.e. higher dendrimer core \n\ngeneration increased gene expression, demonstrating that surface modification and incorporation of \n\nethylenimine core are key factors contributing to improve biocompatibility and transfection efficiency. \n\nTziveleka et al. [380,381] have been proposing different synthetic vectors for the prospective application as \n\ngene transfection agents. Interestingly, fourth generation PPI dendrimers partially or fully surface-\n\nmodified with guanidinium groups were able to complex with plasmid DNA (pEGFP-C2 and pGL3 \n\nluciferase reporter vectors). In vitro studies using human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and the monkey \n\nkidney fibroblast (COS-7) cells, showed that complete replacement of primary amino groups with the \n\nhydroxylated moieties resulted in complete loss of transfection efficiency. Contrarily, functionalization of \n\nthe dendrimers with guanidinium groups enhanced transfection efficiency. This enhancement was \n\ndependent on the number of guanidinium groups at dendrimer periphery and cell type. In fact, the fully \n\nguanidinylated-modified dendrimer showed the best transfection efficiency. The advanced explanation is \n\nrelated with the accumulation of the guanidinium group at the dendrimeric surface, which can improve \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 50 - \n \n\ntheir penetrating ability. However, cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that increase in the degree of \n\nguanidinylation increase dendrimer's cytotoxicity. Thus, at light of these data, we can once state that \n\nfunctionalization strategies can be valuable strategy for superior transfection efficiency, but special \n\nattention should be addressed in respect to cytotoxicity, which as in the present work can limit gene \n\ntransfer potency. \n\nChoi [382] adopted a different strategy to improve transfection efficiency of PAMAM dendrimers. In his \n\nwork, it was demonstrated the positive effect on the transfection efficiency of polyplexes by bonding Dex \n\nto PAMAM dendrimers. In vitro studies using human embryonic kidney (293) and mouse neuroblastoma \n\n(Neuro2A) cells, showed that PAMAM-Dex/plasmid DNA (pCMV-Luc) complex had a higher transfection \n\nefficiency as compared to PEI and PAMAM, in the presence of serum proteins. Using 1,2-bis-(o-\n\naminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N',N',-tetraacetic acid-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), a glucocorticoid \n\nreceptor inhibitor, they have proved that Dex-induced translocation of the glucocorticoid receptor \n\nfacilitate transport of complexes into nucleus, thus enhancing by this mean transfection efficiency. \n\nGreat efforts have also been made as an attempt to clarify the mechanism (s) of transfection. Manunta \n\net al. [383] have reported on the route by which dendriplexes are internalised, and mediate gene transfer. \n\nThis work demonstrated that internalization is dependent on the cell type, and it is a successful example \n\nof dendrimer application as a non-viral vector for gene delivery. This report showed that transfection of \n\nthe dendriplexes may occur via different pathways, but in cells expressing caveolae, results suggest that \n\ngene delivery might be occurring by a caveolin-dependent pathway. Ruponen et al. [384] carried out a \n\ncomparative study to investigate the performance of both cationic lipids (e.g. N-(1-(2,3-dio-leoyloxy) \n\npropyl)-N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium methylsulfate (DOTAP) and 1,2-dioleyl-3-phosphatidylethanolamine \n\n(DOPE)) and polymers (e.g. PEI, PAMAM dendrimers and PLL) for gene delivery. Moreover, the effect \n\nof interactions of extracellular polyanionic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) such as hyaluronic acid (HA), \n\nchondroitin sulfate, and heparan sulfate with positively charged plasmid DNA complexes on the \n\ntransfection efficiency was investigated. Results have shown that polycations condensed DNA more \n\neffectively as compared to that of monovalent lipids. Furthermore, polyplexes (PEI, PLL) were \n\ninternalized by the cells more efficiently than lipoplexes. It was also found that sulfated GAGs (heparan \n\nsulfate, chondroitin sulfates B and C) completely blocked transfection, except in the case of liposomes \n\nwith DOPE. Moreover, it was evidenced that sulfated GAGs induced DNA release from PEI complexes, \n\nbut DNA release from the complexes was not required for the inhibition of transfection. By its turn, HA \n\nalso inhibited transfection by PEI, PAMAM dendrimers. This comphreensive study suggested that cell \n\nsurface GAGs, namely heparan sulfate can inhibit transfection mediated by both cationic lipids and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 51 - \n\n \n\npolymers indicating that mechanistic information can help to develop more efficient vectors for gene \n\ndelivery.  \n\nOn the other hand, the protection of DNA from in vivo degradation by the vectors is another key feature \n\nfor success in gene delivery. Recently, new step forward report by Diaz-Mochon [385] showed that a \n\nhybrid combination of PAMAM and peptide dendrimers, the so-called peptoid dendrimers were able to \n\ntransfect cells with higher efficiency than the PAMAM counterpart and were also non-toxic. In part, this \n\nwork supported previous findings which demonstrated that combination of primary and secondary \n\namines generates a \u2018\u2018proton sponge\u2019\u2019 effect which can facilitate the DNA transfection process, by \n\nfacilitating the release of the plasmid from the cytoplasmic lysosome. Thus, efficiency of dendrimer/DNA \n\ncomplexes may be favoured by prolonging the release of plasmid. \n\nAn early stage work reported by Herrmann [386] described the synthesis of polyphenylene dendrimers \n\nfunctionalized with lysine residues or substituted with short peptide sequences composed of five lysine \n\nor glutamic acid repeats and a C- or N-terminal cysteine residue. This group postulated that these \n\namino acid and peptide functionalized dendrimers may be of interest as model compounds to study \n\nDNA complexation. \n\nThere are few papers which employ dendritic PLL as a gene delivery carrier, either alone or in \n\ncombination with linear polymers or PEG. However, M\u00e4nnist\u00f6 et al. [387] have been shown that the shape \n\nand charge of these non-viral vectors greatly influences their complexation with DNA and ultimately their \n\ntransfection efficiency. Their study showed the ability of PLL dendrimers for complexing with DNA. \n\nLinear polymers were more efficient than dendritic ones. At low Mw of PLL, DNA binding and \n\ncondensation were less efficient, particularly with dendrimers. PEGylation did not decrease DNA \n\ncondensation of PLLs at less than 60% (fraction of Mw) of PEG. Moreover, introduction of PEG \n\nstabilized the complexes sterically. Internalization of PLL/DNA complexes was high and PEGylation \n\nincreased the transfection efficacy. However, overall transfection level of PLL was low possibly due to \n\ninadequate escape of the complexes from endosomes or poor release of DNA from the complexes. \n\nHigashi et al. [388] have been studying the interaction of water soluble PLL-shelled dendrimers \n\npossessing various PLL segment (n = 5-40) with DNA by circular dichroism spectroscopy, dynamic light \n\nscattering, and melting behavior of double-stranded DNA. Double helical DNAs were found to complex \n\nwith dendritic PLLs (G3) [5, 10, and 20] primarily via electrostatic interactions. Moreover, a longer PLL-\n\ncontaining (G3) was found to interact with DNA more effectively than a shorter one. Okuda et al. [389] \n\nhave also investigated the effect of substituting terminal cationic groups in PLL on the gene delivery into \n\ncells, in particular, the effect of guanidinium groups on the transfection. Monodispersed PLL (G6) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 52 - \n \n\ndendrimers in which external amino acids were replaced by arginines and histidines were synthesized. \n\nA particular attention was given to clarify whether histidine shows the activity as an endosomal \n\ndisruption agent. DNA-binding and transfection studies revealed that arginine-terminated PLL \n\ndendrimers could bind to the DNA more efficiently, and presented higher transfection efficiency as \n\ncompared to those for histidine-terminated PLL. In fact, histidine-terminated PLL did not mediate \n\ntransfection. Despite, the terminal histidines of PLL dendriemrs, especially the imidazole groups, had a \n\nkey role in the pH-dependent complex formation and transfection (neutral and acidic pH\u00b4s). The unique \n\ncharacter of histidine-PLL dendrimers is most promising. \n\nAs aforementioned, cationic PAMAM dendrimers have been proving to efficiently mediate transfection of \n\nDNA into a variety of mammalian cells, in vitro. However, as highlighted the major drawback of high \n\ngeneration cationic dendrimers is their associated cytotoxicity.  Anionic dendrimers, on the other hand, \n\nhave shown no cytotoxic effect on cells over a broad range of concentrations. Hussain et al. [390] have \n\nreported the successful use of ONs conjugated with pentaerythritol-based anionic dendrimers in \n\ninhibiting cancer cell growth. In vitro studies using cancer cells showed that ONs-dendrimer conjugates \n\nenhance the cellular uptake, up to 4 times as compared to that for naked ONs. These data clearly \n\ndemonstrated that anionic ONs-dendrimer conjugates may represent attractive alternatives to cationic \n\nnon-viral vectors for the delivery of gene silencing ONs. However whether the system may facilitate the \n\ndelivery of duplex siRNA for gene silencing by RNA interference need to be answer. Therefore, further \n\nstudies are necessary to evaluate the full potential of the delivery system.  \n\nElectrophoretic studies carried out by Kuo et al. [391] have demonstrated that fifth generation PAMAM \n\nand PPI dendrimers altered or blocked the mobility of RNA isolated from human macrophage-like cells \n\n(U937 cell line) and mouse fibroblast NIH/3T3cells previously exposed to DNA/dendrimer complexes. At \n\nhigher dendrimer:DNA ratio, dendrimers interacted with RNA after isolation, but gene expression of \n\nthese complexes was not affected. Electrostatic forces were found to be responsible for the dendrimer-\n\ninduced alteration in RNA mobility. Because RNA isolation is routinely used for biological applications, \n\nsuch dendrimer-induced alteration in RNA mobility should be accounted for when further processing \n\nRNA for related applications, and the use of high ionic strength solvents (2 M NaCl solution) to disrupt \n\nthe electrostatic forces binding dendrimers to RNA is advised. \n\nA final key aspect in the gene delivery is related to the need for controlling gene transfection. This can \n\nbe accomplished by developing controllable and nontoxic gene delivery systems that are stimuli-\n\nresponsive. For example, Nishiyama et al. [392] proposed an innovative strategy based on PCI gene \n\ndelivery. In their work, they have developed a ternary complexes (size between 100 and composed of a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 53 - \n\n \n\ncore of and cationic peptides (C(YGRKKRRQRRRG)2) that were enveloped in the second generation \n\naryl ether dendrimers (32 carboxyl groups at the periphery) with a phtalocyanine core (photosensitizer). \n\nIn vitro transfection studies using human cervical epithelioid carcinoma (HeLa) cells demonstrated that \n\nthis ternary system enhance (>100-fold) transgene expression as compared to conventional reagents \n\nsuch as PEI and Lipofectamine, in vitro. Moreover, it was shown that PCI-mediated gene delivery \n\nreduced phototoxicity of the ternary complexes. For the in vivo studies a reported gene was used. \n\nFluorescence microscopy studies of rat conjunctival tissue revealed that the ternary complex positively \n\ninduced gene delivery by PCI. That work demonstrated that polyplex-polycations significantly affects \n\nboth transfection efficiency and toxicity. Therefore further optimization of this type of systems should \n\ninvolve research on the use of other polycations. Thus, PCI provides us with an opportunity to develop \n\nefficient light-inducible gene delivery systems.  Shieh et al. [393] also investigated phototriggered gene \n\ntransfection by core-modified PAMAM dendrimers (G4). In their work, a 5,10,15-tri(4-acetamidophenyl)-\n\n20-mono(4-carboxylphenyl) porphyrin (hydrophobic core) was introduced into the PAMAM dendrimers \n\nby activation with DCC and N-hydroxysuccinimide. In vitro characterization studies revealed that \n\nporphyrin core-PAMAM dendrimer conjugates were able to complex with green fluorescent protein \n\n(EGFP) plasmid DNA and that the internalization by HeLa cells was concentration-dependent. \n\nMoreover, results from phototoxicity showed that without irradiation more than 94% of the cells survived \n\nwhen incubated with conjugates at a concentration of 20 ?M. However, the complexes induced toxicity \n\nat 50 ?M. For photodynamic therapy, results show that conjugation of porphyrin core to dendrimers did \n\nnot increase the cytotoxicity of the PAMAM dendrimer below 20 ?M, but significantly induced cell death \n\nafter suitable irradiation. Despite, the expression of EGFP was enhanced in HeLa cells using the PCI \n\ntreatment. Thus, that study demonstrated that PAMAM dendrimers conjugated with porphyrin core can \n\nbe an efficient and safe vector for PCI-mediated gene delivery. \n\nDendrimers are one of the most useful nonviral gene delivery systems. Their ability to transfect cells \n\nwithout inducing toxicity and be tuned for stimuli-induced gene delivery confers a great advantage over \n\nother gene delivery vectors for use in vivo. \n\n3.5. THERANOSTICS APPLICATIONS OF DENDRIMERS AND DENDRONIZED POLYMERS  \n\nAlthough opportunities to develop nanotechnology-based drug delivery systems extend into all \n\ntherapeutic classes of pharmaceuticals, the development of effective diagnose and therapeutic, i.e. one-\n\npackage systems that can target different tissues while releasing one or multiple therapeutic agents \n\nunder a external stimuli have been attracting a great deal of attention. For example, in cancer therapy, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 54 - \n \n\nanticancer agents can damage both malignant and normal cells alike. Additional problems include \n\ninstability of the drugs/GFs in the biological milieu and short half-time, systemic migration, and \n\npremature drug loss through either rapid clearance by Mo/Mac, and/or metabolism. The design of most \n\nsophisticated systems should also consider the need for temporal release of the drug (s). Thus, \n\ndendrimers can be tuned for: (i) be stimuli-responsive nanocarriers, (ii) include molecular tags, (iii) \n\npossess high payload efficiency, (iv) decrease dosage requirements as well as re-dosage frequency \n\nand (v) target delivery and minimize drug migration, thus suppressing secondary effects during drug (s) \n\ntreatment. For example, Kuo and colleagues [394] have investigated in vivo, the interactions of second \n\nand third generation PPI dendrimers with human macrophages U-937, since these molecules are \n\nprimarily removed from circulation by the mononuclear phagocyte system. The effect of the type of \n\ndendrimer and concentration on the content of ntracellular responses-reactive oxygen species (ROS), \n\nmitochondria membrane potential, cell size and complexity, and cell cycle profiles were investigated. \n\nAlthough the concentrations of PPI dendrimers used (40-300 ?g.mL-1) were not cytotoxic, various \n\nintracellular responses in dendrimer-treated macrophages occurred in a time-dependent manner. \n\nMoreover, the intracellular responses were found to be dependent on the dendrimer generation. This \n\nwork nicely illustrates that a better understanding of the molecular action of these nanosystems in the \n\ncellular system may be an advantage for best design of safer and more effective delivery systems. \n\nAs previously stated herein, dendrimers fulfill these requirements as they can be stimuli-responsive and \n\ncontrolled-release systems for nucleic acids, bioactive molecules and peptide/protein delivery. Due to \n\nthe possibility of tailoring the end groups, dendrimers are able to interact with the target, such as cell \n\nwalls and/or proteins [159]. The external functional groups may allow the simultaneous, covalent bonding \n\nto therapeutic drugs, targeting devices and fluorescent probes (Figure 9).  \n\nRecently, a combination of polymer chemistry and imaging science approaches has led to the \n\ngeneration of polymer-based bioimaging probes for the diagnosis and treatment of different diseases. \n\nThe ultimate goal of in vivo imaging is to achieve highly sensitive and reliable imaging techniques viable \n\nfor diagnosis in personalized medicine for delivering drugs, following their distribution, and monitoring \n\ntherapy. This concept (theranostics) is based on the \u201cfind, fight and follow\u201d approach. New probes with \n\nenhanced capabilities and performance should be developed specific to nano-imaging techniques. Key \n\nresearch priorities for targeted delivery and in vivo imaging should address: (i) design of nanostructures \n\nwith stealth properties that prevent them from being opsonised or cleared before reaching the target \n\ncells, (ii) ability to penetrate into cells and crossover biological barriers like the BBB, uptake and \n\nrecycling of nanostructures, (iii) nanocarriers or strategies that selectively targets diseased cells, tissues \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 55 - \n\n \n\nand organs, (iv)  trans-endocytosis of nanostructures, (v) safety evaluation (in vitro/in vivo cytotoxicity, \n\nhaemo-compatibility and immunogenicity), in vivo carrier biodistribution, and (vi) compatibility with \n\nexternal activation by magnetic field, ultrasound, X-ray, or optics to trigger the therapeutic activity. For \n\nexample, the Kobayashi and coworkers [395] have shown that a dendrimer-based magnetic resonance \n\ncontrast agent may be useful for in vivo detection of renal tubular damage. By its turn, Rietveld et al. [396] \n\ndeveloped dendrimers with tetrabenzoporphyrin cores for in vivo oxygen imaging. While it is promising \n\nto both incorporate therapeutic agents and molecular-tags on the dendrimers and improve their potency \n\n[73], the possibility of combining diagnosis and therapy in multi-functional dendrimer-based nanosystems \n\ncan allow the early detection, targeting and treatment of several diseases.  \n\n \n\n \n\nTargeting \ndevice\n\n-X- Drug\n\nFluorescent \nprobe\n\nTargeting \ndevice\n\n-X- Drug\n\nFluorescent \nprobe\n\n \n\nFigure 9. Schematic representation of dendrimers with the external binding of the drug and fluorescent \n\nprobes for applications in theranostics (one package system). It is possible follow the biodistribution, \n\ninternalization and intracellular trafficking within cells. The use of targeting devices such as antibodies to \n\naugment specificity is also possible. The drug can linked to dendrimers using different spacers or bonds \n\n(X), which can be cleaved under a certain external stimuli, thus stimuli- or bio-responsive release is an \n\nadditional possibility. \n\nThomas et al. [397] have linked PAMAM dendrimers (G5) with FITC for tracking, and two different \n\nantibodies  60bca and J591 antibodies that bind to CD14 and prostrate specific membrane antigen \n\n(PSMA), respectively. This work showed the receptor specificity as the conjugates bound to specific \n\nantigen expressing cells. By its turn, Shukla and coworkers [398] have synthesized PAMAM dendrimers \n\n(G5) conjugated to anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody by tagging the formulation with alexaFluor (AF). \n\nFlow cytometric studies revealed the uptake of conjugate by HER2 expressing cells while no such \n\naffinity was found for MCA-207 control cells that did not express HER2, in vitro.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 56 - \n \n\nAccording to the literature, the success of entrapping small molecules inside the dendrimer depends on \n\nthe mutual properties between the host and the guest molecules. For example, Domanski et al. [83] \n\nreported on the attempts to entrap of  small fluorescent probes commonly used to evaluate membrane \n\nfluidity inside the dendrimer. This work has shown that the 12-(9-anthroyloxy) stearic acid (12-AS), a \n\nnon-polar fatty acid derivative, was successfully incorporated into the PAMAM dendrimers cavities, \n\nwhile on the contrary 1-(trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5 hexatriene p-toluenesulfonate (TMA-\n\nDPH), a amphiphilic salt possessing positive charge, was not.  \n\nKolhe et al. [399] have demonstrated that ibuprofen predominantly forms a complex with PAMAM (G3 and \n\nG4) dendrimers because of the ionic interaction between the -NH2 end groups and the carboxyl group of \n\nibuprofen. In this work, they demonstrated that the in vitro release of ibuprofen from drug-dendrimer \n\ncomplex is appreciably slower compared to pure ibuprofen. Moreover, the FITC-labeled dendrimer-\n\ncomplexed drug enters human lung epithelial carcinoma A549 cells much faster than pure drug \n\nsuggesting that dendrimers may be able to carry the complexed drug inside cells efficiently. That group \n\n[56] synthesized a fourth generation PAMAM (PAMAM-OH) dendrimer covalently linked to ibuprofen \n\nusing dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) as a coupling agent.  A high payload nanocarrier was obtained; \n\n58 molecules of ibuprofen were covalently conjugated to one molecule of PAMAM-OH (G4) dendrimer. \n\nFITC-labeled dendrimer-drug conjugate nanoparticles internalization was evaluated in vitro once using \n\nA549 cells. The pharmacological activity of the dendrimer-ibuprofen conjugate was compared to pure \n\nibuprofen at various time points by measuring the suppression of prostaglandin E2. Results \n\ndemonstrated the high internalization efficency of the FITC-labeled dendrimer-drug conjugate and \n\nsuperior therapeutic activity due to faster prostaglandin E2 suppression. Thus, the results suggest that \n\ndendrimer-ibuprofen conjugate improve the drug efficacy by enhanced cellular delivery, and may \n\nproduce a rapid pharmacological response. For example, several ligands are known to be associated \n\nwith tumour. Ligand based dendritic polymers have been attracting great deal of attention for find \n\napplications in cancer-cell-specific targeting [102] and tumour therapy [400].  \n\nTransferrin is a ?-globulin (?1-glycoprotein) and facilitates the transport of ferric ion (Fe3+) through \n\ntransferrin receptors on the plasma membrane. In fact use of transferrin as a ligand has been explored \n\nas a suitable delivery system for site-specific delivery to tumours [401]. PLL covalently linked with \n\ntransferrin for delivery of ONs when exposed to human leukemic (HL-60) cells have been stated to \n\npromote apoptosis to a greater extent as compared to free ONs. Another paper [402] demonstrated that \n\nPEGylated poly(cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles conjugated to transferrin were effective on the delivery of \n\npaclitaxel (PTX), an antitumour drug. PEGylation prevented aggregation of nanoparticles and transferrin \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 57 - \n\n \n\neffectively determined tumour site. An excellent study by Choi and coworkers [102] is appropriate to \n\nhighlight herein. Their innovative wotk consisted on the development of dendrimers conjugated to \n\ndifferent biofunctional moieties [FITC for imaging, and folic acid (FA) for targeting], and then were link \n\ntogether using complementary DNA oligonucleotides to produce clustered molecules for targeting \n\ntumour cells through folate receptors. This step forward allowed both obtain efficient DNA-linked \n\ndendrimer clusters for intracellular imaging and therapeutics, and circumvent the tedious synthesis of \n\nmultiply-functionalized dendrimers.  \n\nInstead of linking oligonucleotides to the dendrimers, Majoros [403] synthesized a multifunctional PAMAM \n\ndendrimer (G5) conjugated with FITC, FA, and PTX. In vitro studies have shown that drug-free \n\ndendrimer conjugates were not cytotoxic even at high concentrations. On contrary, drug-loaded \n\ndendrimer conjugates were toxic to both folate receptor-positive and folate receptor-negative cells as a \n\nresult of non-specific binding at concentrations around 200 nM. \n\nAnother good example of PAMAM dendrimer based multifunctional devices (target the desire cells, \n\nreleasing the desired drug and monitoring their internalization-fluorescent probe) has been reported by \n\nIslam et al. [404]. This group partially acetylated PAMAM dendrimers (G5) that were then conjugated with \n\nFITC, FA and MTX. These intended for targeting tumour cells through the folate receptor, while \n\nreleasing intracellularly an antitumour drug. Interestingly, they have shown that HPLC analysis is a \n\nvaluable technique to determine the purity and stability of dendrimer-based complexes. Yang et al. [405] \n\nhave synthesized FITC- and biotin-linked PAMAM dendrimer (G5) conjugates and investigated their \n\nability for targeting cancer cells. The bifunctional conjugate (FITC-biotin-dendrimer) exhibited much \n\nhigher internalization by HeLa cells than the conjugate without biotin. The uptake was found to be \n\nenergy and dose-dependent, and could be effectively blocked by dendrimer-conjugated biotin. Results \n\nindicate that the biocompatible biotin-dendrimer conjugate can be a promising nano-platform for therapy \n\nand diagnosis of tumours. \n\nEpidermal growth factor (EGF) is an important factor that controls the disposition of neoplastic cells and \n\npotentiates transcription and proliferation of cells. Human growth receptor (HER-2) is a member of EGF \n\nfamily and their number is augmented in several tumours [406], and hence, it provides a potential target \n\nfor immunotherapeutic agent. \n\nNanoparticles having size range of 1-10 nm have capacity to diffuse easily inside the tumour cells. This \n\nhelps to overcome limitations relating to chemotherapy using free drug such as poor in vivo/in vitro \n\ncorrelation and overcome other possible resistances offered by tumours. In fact, Tomalia [407] has also \n\nbeen proposing the use of ~5 nm sodium salt-PAMAM dendrimers (G4.5) nanoparticles possessing a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n \n\n \n \n- 58 - \n \n\n1,4-diaminobutanecore, as multi-purpose nanodevices for oncology drug delivery and diagnostic MRI \n\ncontrast agents.  \n\nRelevant scientific data was recently reported by Saad et al. [408]. In this interesting work they \n\ninvestigated on the role of different nanocarriers (linear polymer, PAMAM dendrimer and liposomes) \n\ncontaining the same bioactive agents, in tumour-specific treatment and imaging. Which nanocarrier is \n\nmost efficient was investigated. In their comphreensive work it was demonstrated for the first time, that \n\nthe targeting of nanocarriers to tumor-specific receptors minimize the influence of the architecture, \n\ncomposition, size and Mw of nanocarriers on the efficacy of imaging and cancer treatment. This step \n\nforward, once illustrate that the nanocarriers potential can only be fully exploited with a much better \n\nunderstanding of how such structures interact with the body and its components, in vitro and in vivo.  \n\n4. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK \n\nNanotechnology and medicine research are merging with other fields leading to completely new science \n\nand superior technological platforms such as those recently reported for regenerative medicine and \n\nneurosciences. The main aim of this review article was to summarize the unique properties, ability to \n\ndesign and improve the biological performance of dendrimers. This novel class of polymers and their \n\nderivatives has been exhibiting unique physicochemical and biological properties which have great \n\npotential to be used in a variety of applications, including tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, \n\nwhich have been discussed herein. \n\nIt was also emphasized their compatibility with nanoscale building blocks such as genetic material, \n\nbioactive molecules and fluorescent-probes, which make them even more versatile than other \n\nnanomaterials, indeed probably unique feature to be used in theranostics. Dendrimers arises in a time \n\nwhen common medical practice is based on symptom control, and research is focused on the best \n\ndrugs to relieve the impact and progression of a given disease. Dendrimers may be used as tools to \n\ndiagnose pathologies in an early stage thus helping manage disease in a sustainable manner. There is \n\nhowever, the need to conduct comprehensive research in vivo, to better understand and assess their \n\ntrue value as multifunctional packages. In particular, we still do not know whether these synthetic \n\npolymers, once they entered the body can cause damage to other tissues. Thus, much effort needs to \n\nbe done in future, to evaluate the risk of bioaccumulation and redistribution. Research on their \n\nadsorption and interaction with biological surfaces, the associated uptake mechanisms, long-term \n\neffects, and bioelimination needs also to be determined. Hence new and unexplored characteristics of \n\nnanoscale are opened, and unsettled issues of biocompatibility, which will remain a key challenge \n\n\n\nCHAPTER I. Dendrimers and derivatives as a potential therapeutic tool in regenerative medicine strategies: a review \n\n \n- 59 - \n\n \n\nwithout a definitive near term answer, progress in the field of dendritic polymers will certainly depend on \n\nother not less important aspects. In order to be effective, dendrimer-based products should be based on \n\nscientific evidence for their uselfulness and must be easier to translate from laboratory to the clinic, in \n\nother words be quality-controlable, cost-effective and sustainable. At last but not least, their application \n\nshould be validated from the regulator\u2019s viewpoint, worldwide.  \n\nAs a final remark, the process of converting basic discoveries into marketable products can be long and \n\nhard but certainty arise, since the discovery of dendrimers we can envision things never possible before \n\nand expect many innovations in the puzzled field of regenerative medicine. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 93 - \n \n\nCHAPTER II.  \n\nMaterials and methods \n\nThe main aim of this chapter is to describe in detail, the experimental work and protocols related to the \n\nobtained results that will be provided further, in Section 3. Along with Chapter I, it aims to be a guideline \n\nof the rationale for this research, namely on the aspects related with the selection of the materials, on \n\nthe processing routes used, and characterization process adopted. \n\n1. MATERIALS \n\n1.1. CHITOSAN (CHT) \n\nChitin is a homopolymer of ?(1?4)-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues (Figure 1A). Chitin is a \n\nnatural polysaccharide and is the principal structural component of the exoskeleton of invertebrates \n\nsuch as crustaceans, insects and spiders and it can also be found in the cell walls of most fungi and \n\nmany algae.  \n\nChitosan (CHT) that is positively charged (interact easily with cell surface and negatively charged \n\nmacromolecules), is an N-deacetylated derivative of chitin mainly composed of 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-\n\nglucopyranose units (Figure 1B) [1]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Schematic illustration of the structure of chitin (A), and chitosan (B). \n\nIt has also been reported  that chitosan is biodegradable and non-toxic [2,3]. Important parameters \n\naffecting the characteristics of chitosan are its molecular weight (Mw) and its degree of deacetylation \n\n(DD), representing the proportion of deacetylated units [4]. It is a semi-crystalline polymer and the \n\ndegree of crystallinity, depends on the degree of deacetylation, i.e. crystallinity is maximum for both \n\nchitin (0% deacetylated) and fully deacetylated (100%) chitosan. By its turn, minimum crystallinity is \n\n \n\nO \nCH2OH\n\nH\nH\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nNH\n\nH\nH\n\nO\n\nO\nCH2OH\n\nH\nH \n\nH\n\nOH \n\nNH\n\nH\nH\n\nO\n\nn \n\nC O=\n\nC 3H\nC O=\nC 3H\n\n \n\nO\nCH2OH\n\nH\nH\n\nH\n\nOH\n\nNH2\n\nH\nH\n\nO\n\nO\nCH2OH\n\nH\nH\n\nH\n\nOH \n\nNH\n\nH\nH\n\nO\n\n1-n \n\n \n\nn \n\nC O= \nC 3H\n\nA B \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 94 - \n \n\nachieved at intermediate degrees of deacetylation. Chitosan is insoluble in aqueous solutions above pH \n\n7, but in dilute acids, the free amino groups are protonated and the molecule becomes fully soluble \n\nbelow ~pH 5. The pH-dependent solubility of chitosan provides a convenient mechanism for processing \n\nunder mild conditions. For example, viscous solutions can be extruded and gelled in high pH solutions \n\n[5]. Freeze-drying techniques also allows obtaining highly porous structures by means of freezing a \n\npolymer solution (-20\u00baC and -196\u00baC) [6-9], following with the removal of solvent through lyophilization. \n\nThus, chitosan scaffolds production is also conceivable. If we consider its biological properties such as \n\nbiocompatibility and immunological, antibacterial and wound-healing activity [2, 10-12] and processability, \n\nchitosan is one of the most appealing biomaterials for prospective applications in tissue engineering. \n\nMoreover, given the importance of glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) in stimulating the chondrogenesis [13], \n\nthe use of GAGs or GAG analogs as components of a cartilage tissue engineered scaffold is desired for \n\nimproving chondrogenesis. One such candidate is chitosan, which shares structural characteristics with \n\nvarious GAGs and hyaluronic acid (HA) present in articular cartilage [1].  \n\nFor the research work within this thesis, CHT was chosen for the being used in the production of \n\nbilayered scaffolds (cartilage layer) due to the highlighted advantages. Reagent grade CHT particles \n\nwith a deacetylation degree of ~91% and size in the range of 125-250 ?m were purchased from Vanson \n\n(USA). Since chitosan is a commercial product, it can contain impurities. Their elimination was \n\nperformed using a re-precipitation method as described by Signini and coworkers [14]. \n\n1.2. CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN (CMCHT) \n\nChitin and CHT are attractive macromolecules, but their use is limited due to its poor water-solubility. \n\nChemical modifications in chitosan molecular structure are viable due to the existence of reactive \n\nfunctional groups (e.g. amine -NH2 and hydroxyl -OH), allowing to tailor its degradation profile and widen \n\nits applications [15]. Thus, to develop biomaterials with improved physicochemical properties, attempts \n\nhave been made to modify its structure by introducing acetyl [16], carboxymethyl [17], sulfuryl, or \n\nphosphoryl groups [18], among others.  \n\nCarboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) is a water-soluble biomacromolecule derived from deacetylation and \n\ninsertion of carboxylic functions in chitosan (Figure 2) [19]. CMCht is soluble in a wide range of pH and its \n\nproperties, namely low toxicity and antimicrobial activity [12], may wider its application, including medical \n\nand pharmaceutical areas - mainly for the controlled release of drugs. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.

Schematic illustration of the structure of CMCht. \n\nThe choice of the appropriate reaction conditions and reagents allows the preparation of N-, O-, N,O- or \n\nN,N-dicarboxymethylchitosan [20]. Thus, the properties and applications of carboxymethylchitosan are \n\nstrongly dependent on its structural characteristics, mainly the degree of substitution (DS) and the locus, \n\namino or hydroxyl group.  \n\nFor the purpose of this thesis, reagent grade chitosan particles with a DD of ~91%, monochloroacetic \n\nacid, 1% acetic acid solution, 40% sodium hydroxide solution, and acetone were used in the preparation \n\nof carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht). Sucessful preparation of CMCht was achieved using a reaction \n\nvessel apparatus as represented in Figure 3. The methodology used has been previously reported by \n\nChen et al. [21]. Succintly, chitosan (5 g), 40% sodium hydroxide solution and solvent (100 mL) were \n\nadded into a flask (500 mL) to swell and alkalize at room temperature for 1 hour. Then the \n\nmonochloroacetic acid (18 g) was added into the reaction vessel dropwise for 30 minutes and reacted \n\nfor 2 hours. During that time the temperature was maintained in a water bath at 60\u00baC. The reaction was \n\nstopped by adding 70% ethanol (200 mL). The solid was filtered and rinsed in 70-90% ethanol to de-salt \n\nand de-water, and vacuum dried at room temperature. Finally, the H-form of CMCht was obtained by \n\nsuspending the Na salt CMCht in 80% ethanol aqueous solution (100 mL) and 37% hydrochloric acid \n\n(10 mL) for 30 minutes, under agitation. The solid was filtered and rinsed in 70-90% ethanol to neutral, \n\nfreezed at -80\u00baC and freeze-dried (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain). CMCht with a DD of 80% and DS of \n\n47% was chosen for the being used in the production of composite scaffolds and to surface modify the \n\ndendrimers, due to the previously highlighted advantages. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.

Schematic representation of the reaction vessel apparatus for the synthesis of CMCht. \n\nFor the composites scaffolds production, the incorporation of the bioactive ceramic filler has been \n\ncarried out with two main goals. In one hand, a bioactive ceramic has always the potential capability of \n\ninducing a bioactive behaviour in a polymeric matrix [13-15]. On the other, being a ceramic filler, it can \n\npotentially improve the mechanical performance of the polymeric matrix where it is incorporated [13,16,17]. \n\n1.3. HYDROXYLAPATITE (HAP) \n\nHydroxylapatite (HAp) is represented by the chemical formula (Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), and its structure \n\nresembles to the primary mineral component of bone. For some time now, bone substitute materials \n\ncomposed of HAp are available for use in surgery [22]. The reason for this is related with its biological \n\ncharacteristics namely its biocompatibility, non-immunogenic [23] and resorbability [24]. Moreover, it \n\nfacilitates osteointegration of implants [25] and exhibits excellent osteoconductive ability [26,27], i.e. \n\nsupports the ingrowth of bony tissue.  \n\nIn this thesis, HAp powders were prepared by precipitation in an aqueous system (wet-chemistry) at \n\nroom temperature. In the precipitation reaction, solutions of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2 and 85% ortho-\n\nphosphoric acid, H3PO4  were mixed for 2 hours.

Synthesis conditions were \n\nadjusted to obtain a stoichiometric HAp, i.e. Ca/P ratio of 1.67. After complete addition of the acid \n\nsolution, the final pH of medium was adjusted to 11 with concentrated ammonium hydroxide, NH4OH. \n\nVigorous stirring was continued during HAp precipitation. The supernatant was removed after 24 hours \n\nof maturation, and the precipitate filtered under vacuum. The resulting filtrate was dried at 60\u00baC for 24 \n\nhours, and milled in a mortar until obtaining a fine powder for further use.  \n\n1.4. STARCH-BASED BIOMATERIALS \n\nStarch is a mixture of glucans composed of ?-amylose and amylopectin (Figure 4) and is synthesized by \n\nplants. ?-amylose is a linear polymer of several thousand glucose residues ?(1?4)-linked.

Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 98 - \n \n\nThus, the use of starch materials have attracted great attention in tissue engineering applications, as it \n\ncan allow the designing of scaffolds with an adequate degradation rate, i.e. the degradation of the \n\nscaffold matching new tissue formation.  \n\nOur group [30-33] has been proposing the use of starch-based materials obtained from a blend of starch \n\nand polycaprolactone (SPCL) for bone tissue engineering applications. These starch-based materials \n\nhave the advantages of being non-cytotoxicity, biodegradable, present good mechanical properties and \n\ncan be processed by different methodologies.  \n\n1.5. REAGENTS \n\nChemicals used for the synthesis and purification of CHT, CMCht, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles and HAp as well as their processing and characterization, were bought from the following \n\ncompanies: (Aldrich, USA), Fluka (Slovakia and Switzerland), Merck (Germany), Panreac (Spain), \n\nPronalab (Portugal), Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn (Germany), and Sigma or Sigma-Aldrich (Germany). \n\n2. SCAFFOLDS PRODUCTION  \n\n2.1. PROCESSING METHODOLOGIES FOR PRODUCTION OF SCAFFOLDS: OVERVIEW \n\nMuch attention has been given to choose the best processing techniques for the development of \n\nscaffolds of different shape, size and architecture for tissue engineering purposes. The processing \n\ntechnique must allow for the preparation of scaffolds with controlled porosity and adequate pore size, as \n\nwell as tissue matching mechanical properties and an appropriate biological response. Among the \n\nprocessing methodologies myriad, a wide range have been exploited by our group. These are based on \n\nconventional melt-based processing routes, such as extrusion using blowing agents, and other based \n\non multi-step processes such as compression moulding followed by particulate leaching [34]. Others \n\ninclude solvent casting and particle leaching, fibre bonding or more recently 3-D plotting [33,35]. Freeze-\n\ndrying technique has also been widely used for the production of porous structures with different \n\ndensities, shapes, porosities and pore sizes distributions by simply varying parameters such as polymer \n\nconcentration [36-39], type of solvent [40], freezing temperature [6,9,40-42], type of moulds [8,43] and \n\nincorporating porogens [9,36,37]. In practice, the polymer solutions should be previously transferred into a \n\nmould and frozen before freeze-drying at temperatures which are typically comprised between -20\u00baC to \n\n-80\u00baC [6]. Thus, during freeze-drying the space occupied by the frozen solvent will became empty after \n\nsublimation and by this mean originating the pores [44]. It is important to guarantee that the final freezing \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 99 - \n \n\ntemperature is adequate to maintain all the molecules of solvent in the solid state [45]. Otherwise, the \n\nfinal structure will shrink during the drying process resulting on the formation of a dense external skin-\n\nlike layer. By means of using the described methodologies, it is possible to tailor the properties of the \n\ndifferent scaffolds, namely their degradation, architecture and mechanical properties, for several \n\napplications in tissue engineering. \n\nIn this thesis, the scaffolds were produced for applications in bone, cartilage and osteochondral tissue \n\nengineering by four distinct processing routes: (i) co-precipitation route and wax sphere leaching, (ii) \n\nsponge burn-out and sintering, (iii) two-step route, i.e. sponge burn-out and sintering, followed by \n\nimpregnation of the polymer solution and freeze-drying, and (iv) by melt spinning followed by fibre \n\nbonding. \n\n2.2. CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/HYDROXYLAPATITE (CMCHT/HAP) COMPOSITE SCAFFOLDS \n\nThe CMCht/HAp composite materials were prepared by a co-precipitation method using a acidic \n\n\u2018autocatalytic\u2019 electroless bath [46]. This methodology is based on the possibility of chemisorption of \n\nPalladium (Pd2+) on the surface of bioinert polymers, which acts as the catalyst to induce the \n\nprecipitation of calcium-phosphate on its surface. A schematic representation of the principle of the \n\nelectroless baths is shown in Chapter III. Thus, CMCht is able to chelate metal ions such as Pd2+. The \n\nresulting excess of positive charge from the CMht/Pd2+ complex may build up an adjacent layer of \n\nnegative charges (phosphate groups), which can originate a residual charge responsible for attracting \n\nother calcium ions. Consequently, composite scaffolds may be produced since calcium phosphate \n\nprecipitation can occur in the presence of the CMht/Pd2+ complex.  \n\nFor preparation of CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds, CMCht was synthesized as described above \n\nwithout further purification steps. Calcium chloride, CaCl2, ortho-phosphoric acid, H3PO4 and palladium \n\nchloride, PdCl2 were used to prepare the acidic \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 electroless bath, and ammonium \n\nhydroxide 33%, NH4OH solution to adjust the pH of the co-precipitation media. The acidic electroless \n\nbath was prepared by dissolving calcium chloride with a final concentration of 5.6 g.L-1, ortho-\n\nphosphoric acid 3.4 g.L-1, and palladium chloride 0.9 g.L-1 in 500 mL distilled water, under agitation. A \n\n10 wt% CMCht aqueous solution was added to the bath using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3, \n\nFrance) at a speed rate 2 mL.minute-1. The composite precipitate was obtained by means of adjusting \n\nthe pH of the bath to 6 with ammonium hydroxide. The precipitate was filtered under vacuum and the \n\nexcess of water removed by drying at 37\u00baC for 24 hours. Porous structures were prepared by means of \n\nmixing the composite filtrate and 20 wt% wax spheres (Desert Whale Jojoba Company, Inc., USA), with \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 100 - \n \n\na diameter ranging from 50-450 ?m, and transferring into a cylindrical mould with 4-7 mm diameter and \n\n8-22 mm height. After drying at 60\u00baC, the wax spheres were eliminated off by soaking into \n\ntetrahydrofuran, in an ultrasound bath, for several hours. Once, the composite scaffolds were allowed to \n\ndry until constant weight and the scaffolds freeze at -80\u00baC overnight, followed by freeze-drying for the \n\nperiod of 2 days to completely remove the organic solvent. \n\n2.3. HYDROXYLAPATITE (HAP) SCAFFOLDS \n\nThe HAp scaffolds were produced using a combined strategy consisting of a sponge burn-out followed \n\nby sintering. The procedure for obtaining the HAp scaffolds is summarized in Figure 5. The HAp \n\npowders were obtained by wet chemistry as previously described elsewhere. The obtained HAp pellets \n\nwere milled until obtain a fine powder.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5. Schematic representation of the production route of the HAp scaffolds. \n\nThe HAp slurry was prepared by dispersing HAp powders in methanol for 48 hours. Then, polyurethane \n\n(PU, Eurospuma SA, Portugal) cylindrical sponges (10 x 8 mm) featuring fully interconnected pores \n\nwere dipped into the slurry until total impregnation (step 1). To prevent the formation of an external skin-\n\nlike layer, the impregnated PU sponges were transferred to a centrifuge and the excess of slurry was \n\nremoved by centrifuging at 60 rpm for 1 minute (step 2), followed by drying at 37\u00baC, for 24 hours (step \n\nHAp \n\nslurry \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 101 - \n \n\n3) to avoid the formation of cracks. Finally, the impregnated sponges were placed inside the furnace \n\n(Fornocer\u00e2mica, S.A., Portugal) and the PU matrices burned at 900\u00baC for 24 hours, followed by \n\nsintering the HAp scaffolds at 1300\u00baC for 3 hours (step 4). The HAp scaffolds were allowed to naturally \n\ncool inside the furnace (step 5). With this technique, the external shape and internal morphology of the \n\nPU sponge allow to produce HAp scaffolds with controlled internal architecture and external shape. \n\n2.4. HYDROXYLAPATITE/CHITOSAN BILAYERED (HAP/CHT) SCAFFOLDS \n\nIn this thesis, an innovative technique was proposed for obtaining bilayered structures with improved \n\narchitecture, stability and biological properties for osteochondral tissue engineering applications. \n\nHydroxylapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) bilayered scaffolds were produced by adopting a two step \n\nprocedure. Firstly, HAp porous layer (bone-like layer) with 10 mm height and 8 mm diameter were \n\nobtained by the sponge burn-out method as described elsewhere. Secondly, a 3 wt% chitosan solution \n\nwas prepared by dissolving chitosan (CHT) of medium molecular weight and a degree of deacetylation \n\nof ~85% in 0.2 M acetic acid solution. The bilayered HAp/CHT scaffolds were fabricated by placing the \n\nHAp scaffolds into cylindrical silicon moulds (20 mm x 8 mm) and transferring the 3 wt% CHT solution. \n\nTo guarantee that the chitosan solution penetrated into the HAp scaffolds it was left resting for 1 minute \n\nat room temperature. Moulds were freeze at -80\u00b0C and lyophilized (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain) up to 4 \n\ndays to complete remove the frozen solvent, and allow obtaining the \u2018cartilage-like layer\u2019 on the top of \n\nthe \u2018bone-like layer\u2019. Then, HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were neutralized using a 0.1 M sodium \n\nhydroxide solution as previously described [38], freeze at -80\u00b0C and then lyophilized.  \n\n2.5. STARCH-POLYCAPROLACTONE (SPCL) SCAFFOLDS \n\nIn previous studies [35,47], our group demonstrated that SPCL fibre meshes are excellent scaffolds for rat \n\nbone marrow stromal cells, allowing for their proliferation and differentiation into osteoblasts. Thus, in \n\nthe present thesis the starch-based materials were selected to evaluate the combinatorial strategy in \n\ntissue engineering principles employing carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles (see section 3) towards the intracellular release and regimented supply of dexamethasone \n\n(Dex) aimed at control stem cells osteogenic differentiation and de novo bone formation in the absence \n\nof typical osteogenic inducers, both in vitro and in vivo (Chapter VIII and IX). \n\nStarch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds were produced by adopting a two step procedure as \n\npreviously reported [30]. The material used was a blend of starch with approximately 70% by weight of \n\npoly-?-caprolactone (Novamont, Italy). Briefly, fibres of SPCL were produced by melt spinning using a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 102 - \n \n\nmodular co-rotating twin screw extruder in two consecutive steps to a final draw ratio of approximately \n\n1:100. Then, melt spun fibres were chopped. Fibre bundles were randomly displaced into the custom-\n\ndesigned mould cavities and subjected to thermal treatment at 60\u00b0C for 30 min before compression and \n\nfibre bonding. SPCL scaffolds (5 mm diameter and 4 mm height) were obtained through cutting of fibre \n\nbonded meshes with a circular die. Standardized fabrication conditions enabled the production of \n\nscaffolds with 67.4 \u00b1 1.3% porosity (as determined by micro-computed tomography). More details on \n\nSPCL scaffolds can be found elsewhere [32,33]. \n\n2.6. STERILIZATION OF THE SCAFFOLDS \n\nPrior to the cell culture studies CMCht, PAMAM-CT G 1.5, and CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nas well as all scaffolds were sterilized in an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere.  \n\n3. SYNTHESIS OF DENDRONIZED POLYMERS \n\nMany scientific efforts are directed at improving the characteristics of biomacromolecules for \n\napplications as host-guest chemistry, nanocarriers, and catalysts, among others. As discussed in \n\nChapter I, dendrimers are among such type of macromolecules since it offers a lot of possibilities in the \n\nmolecular design. Such chemical versatility also allows producing multifunctional nanobiomaterials. \n\nThus, in this thesis we focused on the development of novel nanoparticle systems with enhanced \n\ncapabilities and performance should be developed specific to drug delivery. Research priorities for \n\ndelivery and in vivo imaging should address simultaneously: (i) design of nanostructures with stealth \n\nproperties that prevent them from being opsonised or cleared before reaching the target cells, (ii) ability \n\nto penetrate into cells and crossover biological barriers like the blood-brain barrier, uptake and recycling \n\nof nanostructures, (iii) trans-endocytosis of nanostructures, (iv)  safety evaluation (in vitro/in vivo \n\ncytotoxicity, haemocompatibility and immunogenicity), in vivo carrier biodistribution, and (v) compatibility \n\nwith external activation by magnetic field, ultrasound, X-ray, or optics to trigger the therapeutic activity. \n\nFor example, Sashiwa et al. [48] has demonstrated to be possible the development of tree-like \n\nhyperbranched chitosan-dendrimer hybrids. These macromolecules were described as based on \n\nchitosan (a trunk) linked to the dendrimer (sub-branch), which can possibly linking a variety of peptides \n\nor sugar molecules (the leaf\u2019s or flower\u2019s). In our approach, we modify amine-terminated \n\npoly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers with water-soluble carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) as an \n\nattempt to functionalize the dendrimers and neutralize the amine groups, which have been found to be \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 103 - \n \n\nresponsible for the toxicity of the dendrimers [49,50]. These macromolecules instead of trees can be \n\ncalled as dendrons or dendronized polymers due to their similar architecture (see Figure 5, Chapter I). \n\n3.1. CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) DENDRIMER (CMCHT/PAMAM) NANOPARTICLES \n\nFor the synthesis of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer macromolecules, carboxymethylchitosan with a DD \n\nof 80% and DS of 47% was used. Starburst\u00ae poly(amidoamine)-carboxylic terminated dendrimers, \n\nPAMAM-CT (generation 1.5, 20% (w/v) methanolic solution) with an ethylenediamine core were \n\npurchased from Aldrich. Carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (CMCht/PAMAM) \n\nnanoparticles were prepared in a stepwise manner as described in Figure 6: (i) increasing the \n\ngeneration of the PAMAM-CT (G 1.5), (ii) obtaining a PAMAM-methyl ester terminated dendrimer, (iii) \n\nreaction of PAMAM and CMCht, i.e. the reaction goes through a condensation reaction between the \n\nmethyl ester and amine groups [51], and (iv) modifying the methyl ester groups that do not react to \n\ncarboxylic ones in the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer followed by precipitation. The increase of the \n\ndendrimers\u2019 generation was carried by transferring an appropriate volume of PAMAM-CT (G 1.5) in \n\nmethanol (MeOH) to a 2 mL volumetric flask. The solvent was evaporated off under nitrogen gas, and \n\nthe traces dried under vacuum in order to completely remove the methanol. The starting compound was \n\nre-dissolved in ultra-pure water to give a final concentration of 10 mg.mL-1 and the pH was adjusted to \n\n6.5 with dilute hydrochloric acid solution (HCl) solution. Then, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) \n\ncarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was added to the solution at a molar ratio sufficient to modify the \n\ncarboxylate residue of the dendrimers and kept under agitation for 30 minutes at room temperature. \n\nEthylenediamine (EDA) was added to the solution at a molar ratio equal to that of EDC and let react for \n\nat least 4 hours. After this period the exceeding EDC was removed by dialysis (benzoylated cellulose \n\ntubing for separating compounds with a molecular weight of ? 1,200 from compounds with a molecular \n\nweight > 2,000). The compound was used without purification in the next step. After preparing the \n\nPAMAM-amine terminated compound, PAMAM-AT, an exhaustive alkylation of primary amines (Michael \n\naddition) was carried [52]. An appropriate volume of PAMAM-AT (~8.4 mmol) was transferred to a 50 mL \n\nflask and 30 mL of MeOH and 1.14 mL of methyl methacrylate (MA, ~12.6 mmol) were added. The \n\nsolution was kept under agitation in a water bath for 24 hours at 50\u00b0C, to obtain the compound \n\n(PAMAM-methyl ester).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.

The final solution was diluted by adding 30 mL of methanol and kept \n\nunder agitation for 72 hours. After this period, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer with carboxylic-terminated \n\ngroups were obtained as described elsewhere [51]. CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were then \n\nprecipitated after addition of an appropriate volume of a saturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 solution \n\nand acetone. \n\n3.2. INCORPORATION OF DEXAMETHASONE (DEX) INTO THE CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) \n\nDENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were mixed with a Dex solution with a final concentration of    \n\n5 x 10-4 M under agitation (w/w). The mixture was then added to the precipitation media consisting of a \n\nsaturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 and acetone solution, under vigorous agitation. Precipitates were \n\ncollected by filtration and dispersed in ultrapure water for dialysis during the period of 48 hours. Both \n\nCMCht/PAMAM and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were obtained by freezing \n\nthe solution at -80\u00b0C and freeze-drying (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain) up to 4 days to complete remove \n\nthe solvent. It is noteworthy that the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are water-soluble at physiological pH. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.

LABELING OF CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES WITH \n\nFLUORESCEIN ISOTHIOCYANATE \n\nIn order to label the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer with a fluorescent probe a 10 mg.mL-1 FITC solution was \n\nprepared in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), in dark conditions. Conjugates of CMCht/PAMAM-\n\nFITC were prepared by covalently bonding the amine group of CMCht and the isothyocianate group of \n\nFITC (thiourea bond), as illustrated in Figure 7.  \n\nBuffer \ncarbonate/hydrogenocarbonate,\n\npH 9.25\n\nFITC-N=C=S + H2N-CMCht/PAMAM FITC-NH-C-NH-CMCht/PAMAM\n\nS\n\n=\n\n(Isothiocyanate \n\nreacting group)\n\n(Amine reacting\n\ngroup)\n\n \n\nFigure 7.

Then, 50 ?L of the FITC/DMSO solution was added per each mL \n\nof CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles buffered solution under agitation, and kept in dark at 4\u00b0C for \n\n8 hours. The FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles solution was dialyzed against ultra-\n\npure water in order to remove unlinked FITC for 24 hours and filtered (pore size &lt;220 nm) in sterile and \n\ndark conditions. The final product was obtained as an orange powder after freeze-drying.  \n\n4. PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION TECHNIQUES  \n\n4.1. MORPHOLOGICAL/MORPHOMETRIC CHARACTERIZATION \n\n4.1.1. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) \n\nIn Chapter III, the microstructure of the CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds before and after immersion into \n\nthe SBF solution, was investigated using scanning electron microscope, SEM (Leica Cambridge S-360, \n\nUK). Prior to the elemental and microstructure analysis, specimens were coated with carbon (Fisons \n\nInstruments, Polaron SC 508, UK) and gold (Fisons Instruments, Polaron SC 502, UK), respectively. \n\nThe current was set at 18 mA with a coating time of 120 seconds. The phosphorus, calcium, sodium, \n\ncarbon and oxygen elemental analysis was achieved by means of using an X-ray detector (Pentafet \n\nmodel 5526, UK) attached to the S-360 microscope, and a voltage of 10 keV was used. \n\nThe same equipment and procedure were used for analysis of HAp and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 106 - \n \n\nFor the in vitro studies using 3-D systems (Chapters IV and VIII), the surface morphology and pore size \n\nof the HAp scaffolds and SPCL scaffolds were also examined under a scanning electron microscope, \n\nSEM (SM-300, Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Prior to microstructure analysis, specimens were \n\nsputter coated with platinum using an Ion coater (IB-3, Eiko Engineering Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan) with a \n\ncurrent set at 6 mA, for a coating time of 2-3 minutes.  \n\n4.1.2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) \n\nThe morphology and size of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was further analysed by \n\ntransmission electron microscopy, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The Netherlands, equipped with \n\na MEGA VIEW-II DOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT DOCU). The nanoparticles were \n\nstained with 2% of phosphotungstic acid and placed on copper grids for further observation. \n\n4.1.3. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies \n\nThe morphology of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM and CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was \n\nalso investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The dendrimer nanoparticles were dispersed in \n\nultrapure water to obtain a solution with final concentration of 1 mg.mL-1, and then 20 ?L was placed \n\nover a 9.9 mm mica disc (Agar Scientific, England) and blown dried with nitrogen gas for subsequent \n\ncharacterization. The samples were analysed using the Tapping Mode\u2122 with a MultiMode AFM \n\nconnected to a NanoScope III controller, both from Veeco, USA, with non-contact silicon nanoprobes \n\n(ca 300 kHz) from Nanosensors, Switzerland. All images were plane-fitted using the third degree-flatten \n\nprocedure included in the NanoScope software version 4.43r8. The particle size distribution was \n\ndetermined with the same software. \n\n4.1.4. Micro-computed tomography (\u00b5-CT) analysis \n\nThe structure and architecture of scaffolds are important factors affecting the performance of the tissue \n\nengineered cell-scaffold constructs. Micro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) is an expedite and \n\nnondestructive technique for examining the morphological and architectural characteristics of the \n\nscaffolds, namely pore size, porosity and interconnectivity [53]. \n\nMicro-Computed Tomography (?-CT) of the CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds was carried out using a \n\nScanco 20 equipment (Scanco Medicals, Switzerland). Mimics\u00ae from Materialise (Belgium) was used as \n\nimage processing software. The X-ray scans were performed in high resolution mode (9 \u00b5m) and 240 \n\nslices of the materials were obtained. The 2-D morphometric analysis of the scaffolds was performed \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 107 - \n \n\nusing a threshold 51 to identify the polymeric phase in order to determine the porosity, and a threshold \n\n133 to identify the hydroxylapatite content along the scaffold (from 0-2000 ?m). \n\nThe 3-D structural and architectural information of the HAp scaffolds was assessed quantitatively and \n\nqualitatively using ?-CT analysis. A series of c.a. 900 2-D slices with a scanning resolution of 11 \u00b5m \n\nwere obtained by irradiating the specimen with penetrative X-rays of 50 keV. Mimics\u00ae was also used as \n\nimage processing software. The porosity along the HAp scaffolds was also evaluated by 2-D \n\nmorphometric analysis using a threshold 300. In addition, the qualitative information of the HAp/CHT \n\nbilayered scaffolds architecture was also investigated. From the CT data set, 300 slices of a region of \n\ninterest corresponding to the interface between HAp and CHT was used to investigate the continuity of \n\nthe HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. A customized threshold technique was used to enhance the CHT \n\ncontrast and remove noise. \n\n4.2. FOURIER-TRANSFORM INFRA-RED (FTIR) SPECTROSCOPY \n\nThe presence and also the environment of functional groups in organic molecules can be identified in a \n\nnon destructive manner by infrared spectroscopy. Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis was \n\nperformed using a Perkin-Elmer spectroscope (Perkin-Elmer 1600 series equipment). Transparent \n\nPotassium bromide (KBr) pellets were prepared by mixing in the ratio of 1:10 of sample/KBr (wt/wt), and \n\nmilling in an agate mortar, followed by uniaxially pressing the powders. All transmission spectra were \n\nrecorded in the region of 4400-450 cm-1, using a minimum of 32 scans, and a 2 cm-1 resolution. \n\nFor evaluation of Dex incorporation into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles FTIR analyses \n\nwere also performed by means KBr pellets containing the samples. Moreover, the FITC labeling \n\nefficiency was also investigated. \n\n4.3. X-RAY DIFFRACTION (XRD) ANALYSIS \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on powder samples of CMCht and CMCht/HAp \n\ncomposite scaffolds, using an X-ray diffractometer with Cu-K? radiation at 50 mA and 40 kV (Philips \n\nPW 1710, The Netherlands). Using flat plate geometry, data were collected from 2 to 62\u00ba 2? values, \n\nwith a step size of 0.02\u00ba, and a counting time of 2 seconds.step-1.  \n\nCrystallinity and phase content of HAp powder, sintered HAp and HAp scaffolds were also investigated. \n\nXRD patterns were examined in the region of 2\u00ba to 65\u00ba with a step size 0.02\u00ba for 2? and scan speed of \n\n0.6\u00ba.minute-1.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 108 - \n \n\n4.4. NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE (NMR) SPECTROSCOPY \n\nNuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a phenomenon which occurs when the nuclei of certain atoms \n\nare immersed in a static magnetic field and exposed to a second oscillating magnetic field. Some nuclei \n\nexperience this phenomenon, and others do not, dependent upon whether they possess a property \n\ncalled spin. 1H NMR (least expensive analysis) is the application of nuclear magnetic resonance in NMR \n\nspectroscopy with respect to hydrogen nuclei within the molecules of a substance. This is a non-\n\ndestructive technique that allows determining the structure of organic compounds. Simple NMR spectra \n\nare recorded in solution, and solvent protons must not be allowed to interfere. In this thesis, 1H NMR \n\nanalysis of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles was carried to investigate the structure of the nanoparticles and incorporation of Dex. For \n\nthis purpose, nanoparticles were dissolved in deuterated water (D2O). The NMR spectra were obtained \n\nwith a Mercury -400BB operating at a frequency of 399.9 MHz at 50\u00b0C. The one-dimensional 1H spectra \n\nwere acquired using a 45\u00b0 pulse, a spectral width of 6.3 kHz and an acquisition time of 2.001 seconds.  \n\n4.5. ZETA POTENTIAL AND PARTICLE SIZE ANALYSES \n\nZeta potential and particle size of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were measured in a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS, \n\nMalvern Instruments, UK).  \n\nZeta potential was calculated by determining the electrophoretic mobility and then applying the Henry \n\nequation. The electrophoretic mobility is obtained by performing an electrophoresis experiment on the \n\nsample and measuring the velocity of the particles using Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). \n\nThe Henry equation (1) is:  \n\nUE=                            (1) \n\nz:  Zeta potential; \n\nUE:  Electrophoretic mobility; \n\n?:  Dielectric constant; \n\n?:  Viscosity; \n\n\u0192(Ka):  Henry\u2019s function; the value used was 1.5, and is referred to as the Smoluchowski approximation. \n\nElectrophoretic determinations of Zeta potential were investigated using the universal \u2018dip\u2019 cell, at pH 3 \n\nand pH 7.4, in a citrate buffer and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solutions, respectively. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 109 - \n \n\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) that utilizes time variation of scattered light from suspended particles \n\nunder Brownian motion to obtain their hydrodynamic size distribution is the most popular technology in \n\nsizing nanoparticles. DLS is a reliable technique that has been used to measure macromolecules and \n\nsmall particles in dilute suspension. Thus, for the present study, particle size analyses were performed \n\nusing the DLS technique. The analyses were carried out in aqueous media with low concentration of \n\nnanoparticles and using disposable sizing cuvettes.  \n\n4.6. ULTRAVIOLET-VISIBLE (UV-VIS) SPECTROPHOTOMETRY \n\nThe FITC bonding to CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and FITC:CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles ratio was also investigated by UV-VIS spectrophotometry (NanoDropTM ND-1000; \n\nNanoDrop Technologies, USA). The labelling efficiency and stability was investigated by UV-VIS \n\nspectrophotometry.  \n\n4.7. THERMOGRAVIMETRIC ANALYSIS \n\nThermal stability and composition of the PU sponges, PU sponge impregnated with HAp before burning, \n\nand HAp scaffolds sintered at 1300\u00b0C was assessed by thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis. A TA-Q500 \n\nanalyser (TA Instruments, USA) was used. The data was obtained using a ramp rate of 5\u00b0C.minute-1. \n\n4.8. MECHANICAL CHARACTERIZATION \n\nCompression tests in dry state were performed using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 4505) \n\npossessing a load cell of 50 kN. A minimum number of 10 CMCht/HAp scaffolds were tested after \n\nstorage at ~20\u00b0C and 55% relative humidity, to obtain an averaged result. Tests were conducted up to \n\nfailure or until 60% reduction in specimen height as previously reported by Boesel et al. [54]. \n\nComplementarily, compression tests \u2018Push-out\u2019 in wet state were carried out by means of using a \n\nMiniature Materials Tester (Minimat Vsn 3.1, Rheometric Scientific Ltd, UK). This equipment is capable \n\nof sensing full scale load ranges from 20 N up to 1000 N at 37\u00b0C. Before conducting the tests, \n\nCMCht/HAp composite scaffolds were introduced inside the perforated stainless steel shells (6 mm of \n\ndiameter and 11 mm height), and soaked into a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution for 24 hours \n\nat 37\u00b0C inside an oven. Afterwards, the shells containing the composite scaffolds were immersed into \n\nPBS solution at 37\u00b0C and a minimum number of 5 samples were tested. A baseline was also performed \n\nfor each sample using the same experimental conditions but running the experiments with the empty \n\nstainless steel shells.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 110 - \n \n\nMechanical properties of the HAp scaffolds were also investigated using the Universal Testing Machine \n\n(Instron 4505), at room temperature. The gauge length and diameter of all specimens was 16 mm and 8 \n\nmm, respectively. Tests were conducted with a constant strain rate of 2 mm.minute-1, and up to failure \n\nor until 60% reduction in specimen height. The modulus (E) was determined by linear regression from \n\nthe slopes in the initial elastic portion of the stress-strain diagram. A minimum number of 10 specimens \n\nwere tested, and then E was averaged from the ten measurements. \n\n4.9. SWELLING AND WEIGHT-LOSS STUDIES \n\nWater-uptake or swelling and weight loss of the developed CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds, HAp and \n\nHAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were performed, by soaking into a PBS solution for times up to 30 days, in \n\ntriplicate. The solution was prepared by dissolving 1 tablet of PBS in 200 mL of distilled water to obtain a \n\nfinal concentration of 0.0027 M potassium chloride and 0.137 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4 at 25\u00b0C. The \n\nwater-uptake was determined by the changes on the initial mass of the scaffolds (mi) after incubation in \n\nthe PBS solution at 37 ? 1\u00b0C. The scaffolds were removed after 1, 3, 7, 15, 21 and 30 days of \n\nimmersion; then the excess of solution removed out with a filter paper, and the mass (mw) determined \n\nusing an analytical balance. Finally the scaffolds were dried at 60\u00b0C until constant weight and the mass \n\nwas determined (md) in order to obtain the weight loss. The percentage of water-uptake of scaffolds \n\n(WUs) after each time of immersion (t) was calculated by means of using equation (2), \n\n \n\n \n\nThe percentage of weight loss of the scaffolds (WLs) after each time of immersion (t) was calculated \n\nusing equation (3), \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nWUs,t = [(mw,t-mi)/ mi] x 100  (2) \n\nWLs,t = [(md,t-mi)/ mi] x 100  (3) \n\n  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 111 - \n \n\n4.10. IN VITRO BIOACTIVITY ASSESSMENT \n\nBioactivity tests were performed by soaking the CMCht/HAp composite scaffolds and HAp scaffolds in a \n\nsimulated body fluid (SBF) solution at 37 ? 1\u00b0C for periods of time ranging from 1 to 30 days. Note that \n\nthis solution contains the inorganic ion concentrations resembling to those found in human blood plasma \n\nand pH of 7.4 [55]. After each soaking time the scaffolds were removed from the SBF solution and \n\nimmediately rinsed with distilled water, dried at room temperature for 24 hours and in the oven at 60\u00baC \n\nuntil constant weight. The concentration of the Ca and P ions, after each soaking time, was measured \n\nby inductively-coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES, JY 70 plus, JobinYvon, France) \n\nspectrometry. Triplicate samples were analyzed for each soaking time and an averaged result \n\ncalculated. \n\n4.11. INVESTIGATION OF DEXAMETHASONE (DEX) RELEASE FROM CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES \n\n The amounts of Dex from nanoparticles were measured using the high performance liquid \n\nchromatography (HPLC, ASI-Knauer, Germany) equipment with an UV detector set at 246 nm. The \n\nmobile phase consisted of acetonitrile:acetate buffer (2 mM, pH 4.8-adjusted with glacial acetic acid) \n\n(50:50 v/v) at flow-rate of 1 mL.minute-1. In brief, Dex release was studied after dissolution of 10 mg of \n\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in 10 mL of phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4, \n\nSigma, USA) solution (PBS) in the absence or presence of 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Sodium \n\nazide 0.01% (w/v) was added to the buffer. The in vitro release studies were performed at 37?C and 60 \n\nrpm for times ranging from 1 hour until 7 days. At set time intervals, 1 mL of sample was taken for \n\nanalysis and the same volume replaced by the respective buffer solution. Prior analysis, samples were \n\ncentrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 minutes. A solution with sample/acetonitrile/acetate buffer (50:25:25, \n\nv/v) was prepared for further analysis. A Eurospher 100 C-18 analytical column (ASI-Knauer, Germany) \n\nwas used. The retention time of Dex was 4 minutes. A calibration curve was obtained following the \n\nmethod described by Sun et al. [56]. Results were expressed as an average \u00b1 standard deviation, n=6. \n\n5. IN VITRO BIOLOGICAL TESTING  \n\n5.1. CELL SOURCES  \n\n5.1.1. Bone marrow stromal cells isolation and culture \n\n5.1.1.1. Rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 112 - \n \n\nRat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) isolated from Fisher 344 rat (F344/N) were used to evaluate \n\nthe osteogenic potential of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, in vitro and in vivo \n\n(Chapters VI, VIII, IX, and X). Seven-week-old Fischer 344/N male rats were purchased from Japan \n\nSLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan) and sacrificed in accordance with the Ethics Committee at the Tissue \n\nEngineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). The epiphyseal regions of the femora were removed \n\nand marrow plugs in the femoral shafts were flushed out using Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium \n\n(MEM, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) supplemented with 15% FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% \n\nantibiotic-antimycotic, A/B (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution [57]. The RBMSCs isolation was performed \n\nunder aseptic conditions. RBMSCs were transferred to a T75 cm2 culture flask and expanded in the \n\npresence of complete MEM medium at 37\u00baC in a 5% CO2 incubator. Then, the culture medium was \n\nchanged every 2 or 3 days. After reaching confluency, the cells (passage 1, P1) were released from \n\nsubstratum with 1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) and centrifuged at 900 rpm for \n\n5 minutes. A cell suspension was prepared and cell concentration determined using an automatic cell \n\ncounter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, Japan).  \n\n5.1.1.2. Goat bone marrow stromal cells (GBMSCs) \n\nGoat bone marrow stromal cells (GBMSCs) were isolated from the iliac crest of adult goats and cultured \n\nwith basic culture medium - DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) \n\nsupplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B solution, under standard culture conditions.

Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons \n\nHippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from P4 Wistar rats [58]. Upon dissection, hippocampus \n\ntissue samples were submitted to a trypsin based enzymatic digestion (0.05% Trypsin \u2013 Gibco; 3 \n\nmg.mL-1 BSA; 0.0025% DNase in EBSS) for 10 minutes, followed by mechanical dissociation and \n\ncentrifugation. Isolated cells were then plated on poly-D-lysine coated coverslips at a density of 4 x 104 \n\ncells.cm-2. Cultures were maintained (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2/95% air, 90% relative humidity) in Neurobasal A \n\nmedium plus B27 Supplement, 1 mM GlutamaxI, 10 ng.mL-1 basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) and \n\n0.1 mg.mL-1 kanamycin (all from Gibco, USA) for 7 days. From day seven onwards two sets of \n\nexperiments were performed: (i) in order to determine the internalization times of FITC-labeled \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by hippocampal neurons, cultures were incubated with 200 \n\n?g.mL-1 nanoparticles for periods of 1, 2, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24 and 48 hours; and (ii) to understand whether \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.

Primary cultures of cortical glial cells \n\nCortical glial cells were isolated from P4 newborns (Wistar Rats) as previously described [59]. Upon \n\ndissection, cortices were submitted to an enzymatic cocktail (30 mg.mL-1 DNase, 0.25% Trypsin, both \n\nfrom Sigma) in Ca and Mg free HBSS followed by mechanical dissociation. Glial cells were then \n\nobtained by centrifuging the resulting cells suspension at 800 rpm for 2 minutes, and plated out on \n\ncoverslips previously coated with poly-D-lysine at a density of 4 x 104 cells.cm-2. Glial cells were then \n\nmaintained for one week in DMEM supplemented with 1% A/B and 10% FBS. At this time point similar \n\nexperiments to those performed with hippocampal cultures were carried out. In order to determine if \n\nastrocyte and oligodendrocyte cells proliferation was affecting the levels of internalization after 7 days of \n\nincubation with or without renovation, cultures were allow to grow and establish, being later on treated at \n\nday 7 (within a 14 day culturing period time frame) with 5-fluoro-2\u2019-deoxiuridina (FUdR), a known \n\ninhibitor of glial cell proliferation. \n\n5.2. CELL SEEDING TECHNIQUES \n\n5.2.1. Seeding of GBMSCs onto the HAp porous layer of bilayered scaffolds and 3-D culturing  \n\nAfter expansion, GBMSCs were enzymatically lifted with 3 mL of trypsin after reaching 80% of \n\nconfluence at P1 or P2. A cell suspension was prepared and seeded onto the HAp porous layer in a \n\nscaffold drop-wise manner, at a cellular density of 2.1 x 105 cells.mL-1. GBMSCs-scaffolds constructs \n\nwere cultured in 48-well plates for 3 days with basic medium in static conditions. For inducing \n\nosteogenic differentiation, cell-seeded scaffolds were cultured with an osteogenic media consisting of \n\nalpha-MEM (Minimal Essential Medium Eagle alpha modification) supplemented with osteogenic \n\nsupplements namely, 10-8 M Dex, 50 ?g.mL-1 ascorbic acid and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate. The \n\nconstructs were cultured for 3 days in static cultures with basal medium plus 14 days in osteogenic \n\nmedium (17 days) and under dynamic conditions by using a lab rotator (Model DSR 2800 V, Digisystem \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.

Seeding of GBMSCs onto the CHT porous layer of bilayered scaffolds and 3-D culturing  \n\nTo induce chondrogenic differentiation, CHT scaffolds were seeded with 2.5 x 105 GBMSCs and \n\ncultured for 7, 21 and 28 days with chondrogenic medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10 \n\nng.mL-1 recombinant human transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-?1) (Sigma, USA), ITS+1 (100 x \n\nliquid media supplement), 0.1 M sodium pyruvate, 35 mM proline, 17 mM ascorbic acid and 1 mM Dex. \n\nThe cell-scaffold constructs were also cultured under dynamic conditions by using a lab rotator system. \n\nSamples were retrieved after 7, 21 and 28 days of chondrogenic culture. Before chondrogenic medium \n\nwas added, samples were cultured for 3 days in basal medium in static conditions. In both cases, \n\nculture media were changed every 2-3 days. \n\n5.2.3. Seeding of RBMSCs onto the HAp and SPCL scaffolds for the in vitro and in vivo studies   \n\nThe RBMSCs (passage 1, P1) were released from substratum with 1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM \n\nEDTA (Invitrogen, USA) and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 minutes, after reach confluence. The \n\nsupernatant was aspirated and cells re-suspended with 10 mL of complete culture medium. Cell \n\nconcentration was determined using an automatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, Japan). \n\nPrior seeding, the viability of the RBMSCs was also analyzed with a NucleoCounter (ChemoMetec A/S, \n\nDenmark) [60]. In addition, the HAp scaffolds were de-aired in MEM medium under vacuum [61]. Then, \n\none scaffold was placed in a well of 96-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plate and RBMSCs \n\nseeded in a drop-wise manner. RBMSCs expanded in complete MEM medium, MEM medium \n\nsupplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and MEM \n\nmedium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex were seeded onto each HAp and SPCL scaffolds. The effect of \n\ncell density was evaluated by seeding different cell numbers (1 x 106 and 2 x 105) onto the HAp \n\nscaffolds. Finally, RBMSCs-HAp and RBMSCs-SPCL scaffolds constructs were cultured in complete \n\nMEM medium under standard culture conditions to allow cell adhesion, for the period of 12 hours. The \n\nsame protocol was carried out for the in vitro studies, though different numbers of RBMSCs per scaffold \n\nwere tested. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.

For this purpose, a \n\nfluorimetric dsDNA quantification kit (PicoGreen, Molecular Probes) was used. The samples were \n\ncollected on day 0, day 3 and day 17, washed twice with a sterile PBS solution and transferred into 1.5 \n\nmL microtubes containing 1 mL of ultra-pure water. GBMSCs-HAp and -CHT were incubated for 1 hour \n\nat 37\u00baC in a water-bath and then stored in a -80\u00baC freezer until testing. Prior to DNA quantification \n\nconstructs were thawed and sonicated for 15 minutes. Samples and standards (ranging between 0 and \n\n2 \u00b5g.mL-1) were prepared per each well of an opaque 96-well plate were added 28.7 \u00b5L of sample or \n\nstandard plus 71.3 \u00b5L of PicoGreen solution and 100 \u00b5L of Tris-EDTA buffer. Triplicates were made for \n\neach sample or standard. The plate was incubated for 10 minutes in the dark and fluorescence was \n\nmeasured on a microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an emission of 490 nm and an \n\nabsorbance wavelength of 520 nm. A standard curve was created and sample DNA values were read \n\noff from the standard graph. \n\nBy its turn, DNA quantification in 2-D and 3-D cultures using RBMSCs (Chapters IV, VI and VIII) were \n\nperformed using the nuclear dye Hoechst 33258 (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) according to the method \n\npreviously described [62]. Prior to the assay, the RBMSCs-scaffold constructs were washed with a Ca \n\nand Mg-free PBS solution. Then, constructs were transferred to a 2 mL eppendorf, pulverized with \n\nzirconia\u2019s balls (milling time of ~2 minutes at 25 shakes.second-1) using a ball mixer mill (Retsch GmbH, \n\nGermany), and sonicated in 0.2% Triton-X (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution for 5 minutes. Finally, the \n\nsamples were sonicated and the DNA quantification carried out. The standard DNA solutions were \n\nprepared using salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen, USA). \n\n5.4. CYTOTOXICITY SCREENING  \n\n5.4.1. MTS assay \n\nMTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) \n\nviability test was performed to determine the cytotoxicity of HAp porous scaffolds and HAp/CHT \n\nbilayered scaffolds leachables that might result from the processing methodology used to obtain the \n\nHAp scaffolds and/or leachables of the polymeric component of the bilayered materials. Mouse \n\nfibroblastic-like cells (L929 cells; European collection of cell cultures-ECACC, UK), were cultured in \n\nbasic medium: DMEM without phenol red supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B solution containing \n\n10,000 units.mL-1 penicillin G sodium, 10,000 ?g.mL-1 streptomycin sulphate and 25 ?g.mL-1 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 116 - \n \n\namphotericin B as Fungizone\u00ae in 0.85% saline solution. L929 cells were incubated at 37\u00baC in an \n\natmosphere containing 5% of CO2, and after achieving confluence a cell suspension was prepared with \n\na concentration of 8 x 104 cells.mL-1 and seeded onto 96-well TCPS plates. L929 cells were incubated \n\nfor 3 days with different concentrations of HAp and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds extracts (25, 50, 75 \n\nand 100%). Eight replicates were considered per sample. Extracts of all samples were prepared as \n\npreviously described by Gomes et al. [31]. L929 cells relative viability (%) was determined for each \n\nextract concentration and compared to TCPS. Latex extracts were used as a positive control of cellular \n\ndeath. All cytotoxicity tests were performed in triplicate. \n\nFor both neurons and glial cells, cell viability and metabolic activity was also assessed by the MTS test \n\n(Chapter VII), after seven days of incubation (with or without renovation) with FITC-labeled \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. This assay, or others similar to it (MTT, WST-1), have been \n\nwidely used to measure cellular viability and proliferation. Hippocampal neurons and glial cells cultures \n\n(n=3) were placed in culture medium containing MTS in a 5:1 ratio and incubated in a humidified \n\natmosphere at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2. After three hours of incubation 100 ?L of solution from each well \n\nwere transferred to a 96-well TCPS plate and the optical density was determined at 490 nm.  \n\n5.4.2. Total protein quantification \n\nIn order to complement the data obtained with the MTS test (Chapter VII), protein assay was carried out \n\nto relate the amount of adherent cells present in the cultures using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce \n\nChemical, USA). The bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay is a rapid and convenient method for the \n\ndetermination of the relative number of adherent cells in tissue culture [63]. This system uses BCA as the \n\ndetection reagent for Cu+1, which is formed when Cu+2 is reduced by protein in an alkaline environment. \n\nThe purple coloured reaction product is formed by the chelation of two molecules of BCA with one \n\ncuprous ion (Cu+1). The BCA method provides a more rapid and sensitive procedure with greater \n\nstability of color than is obtained using the Lowry method. Cells were lysed in ultra-pure H2O after which \n\nthe total protein was quantified according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. At the end of the assay,      \n\n100 ?L of each sample were transferred to a 96-well plate where a standard curve was prepared and \n\nthe absorbance read at 562 nm in a multi-well plate reader (Tecan, USA). \n\n5.4.3. Luminescent cell viability assay and osmolality \n\nA luminescent cell viability assay based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was \n\nperformed by exposing RBMSCs to CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (Chapter VI). RBMSCs \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 117 - \n \n\nwere isolated from femora of 7 week-old male Fischer 344/N rats (SLC Inc. Japan), and expanded in \n\nT75 cm2 culture flasks in the presence of MEM with 15% FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% A/B \n\n(Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution. The animals were sacrificed by administrating an excess of \n\nanesthesia, in accordance to the Ethics Committee at the Tissue Engineering Research Center \n\n(Amagasaki, Japan). After reaching confluency, the cells (passage 1, P1) were released from \n\nsubstratum and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was aspirated and cells re-\n\nsuspended with 10 mL of complete culture medium. Cell concentration was determined using an \n\nautomatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, Japan). RBMSCs were seeded (sub-cultured) to \n\neach well of a 96-well TCPS plate at a cell density of 5 x 103 cells.mL-1. A solution of CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles at a concentration of 10 mg.mL-1 was prepared in a complete culture medium. \n\nSerial dilutions (1, 0.1, 0.01 mg.mL-1) were further prepared using the complete culture medium. \n\nPossible changes in the osmolality of the culture media were investigated using an automatic cryoscopic \n\nosmometer (OSMOMAT O 30-D, Gonotec, Germany). After a period of 24 hours, the culture medium \n\nwas changed by the respective serial dilutions and the cells cultured under standard culture conditions \n\nfor 1 and 3 days. A latex rubber extract was used as the positive control for cellular death. Finally, the \n\nATP content was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay, \n\nfollowing the protocol provided by the supplier (Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was \n\nmeasured using opaque-walled multi-well plate in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-\n\nElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA).  \n\nCytotoxicity screening of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds using RBMSCs was also investigated, in vitro \n\n(Chapter VIII) by luminescent cell viability assay [64]. Prior to RBMSCs seeding, the HAp and SPCL \n\nscaffolds were pretreated (de-airation) to prevent air bubble formation in the pores. Scaffolds were \n\nplaced in 10 mL polystyrene tubes with ventilation caps. MEM medium was added and scaffolds were \n\nde-aired under vacuum using a 20 mL syringe with an attached 21G needle. Then, each scaffold was \n\ntransferred into the respective well of a non-adherent 96-well TCPS plate. RBMSCs (P1) were seeded \n\nonto the surface of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds at a cell density of 5 x 102 cells.scaffold-1, 1 x 103 \n\ncells.scaffold-1, 5 x 103 cells.scaffold-1 and 1 x 104 cells.scaffold-1, and cultured in MEM medium under \n\nstatic conditions for 24 hours, 3 and 7 days. After each time period, the ATP content which signals the \n\npresence of metabolically active cells was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo\u00ae \n\nluminescent cell viability assay (Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was measured in a \n\nmicroplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA), following \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 118 - \n \n\nthe protocol provided by the supplier. All experiments were carried out 3 times using 3 replicates per \n\nexperimental condition.  \n\n5.5. LIVE/DEAD VIABILITY ASSAY AND ADHESION STUDIES \n\nFor study cell adhesion and proliferation onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds (Chapter IV), RBMSCs \n\nwere firstly, isolated and expanded as previously described. After that, RBMSCs were seeded onto the \n\nHAp scaffolds at a cellular density of 5 x 102 cells.scaffold-1, 1 x 103 cells.scaffold-1, 5 x103 cells.scaffold-1 \n\nand 1 x 104 cells.scaffold-1 and cultured in MEM medium for 24 hours, 3 and 7 days under static \n\nconditions. After each time period, the ATP content which signals the presence of metabolically active \n\ncells was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay (Promega \n\nCorporation, USA). The luminescence was measured using opaque-walled multi-well plate in a \n\nmicroplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA). This assay \n\nis based on a luminescence signal that is proportional to the amount of ATP, which by its turn is directly \n\nproportional to the number of viable cells. Moreover, cell adhesion and proliferation was investigated by \n\nmeans of using a LIVE/DEAD viability assay kit (Molecular Probes). RBMSCs were incubated with two \n\nprobes, calcein-AM (green colour) and ethidium homodimer-1 (EtdD-1, bright red colour), for \n\nintracellular esterase activity and plasma membrane integrity, respectively [65]. Then, specimens were \n\nobserved under a 3-D fluorescence microscope (Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope, OLYMPUS Co. \n\nLtd., Japan) and SEM. All experiments were carried out three times using a minimum of 3 samples per \n\nexperimental condition. By its turn, GBMSCs adhesion and morphology onto the surface of the \n\nHAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds was investigated by SEM analysis (Chapter V). For this purpose, after \n\neach culturing period, samples were removed from culture, washed in PBS, fixed in 2.5% \n\nglutaraldehyde, rinsed two times with PBS and dehydrated in series of ethanol concentrations. The \n\nsamples were then dried at room temperature and sputter coated with gold before observation under the \n\nSEM. \n\n5.6. ASSESSMENT OF FITC-LABELED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES INTERNALIZATION \n\n5.6.1. Fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses \n\nIn this thesis, the internalization of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was \n\ninvestigated using different cells types (Chapters VI, VII and X), both by fluorescence microscopy and \n\nfluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 119 - \n \n\nHuman osteoblast-like cells (SaOs-2 cells, ECACC, UK) were used in preliminary tests to evaluate the \n\ninternalization of the nanoparticles. SaOs-2 cells were maintained in T75 cm2 culture flasks, cultured \n\nwith basic culture medium - DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B, and passaged after \n\nreaching confluence. A cell suspension was prepared and seeded on TCPS coverslips (Sarstedt Inc., \n\nUSA) in 24-well plates (1 x 104 cells.well-1) and cultured in standard culture conditions for 24 hours. The \n\ninternalization of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by SaOs-2 cells was assessed after 3, 12, 24 \n\nhours, and 14 days. After each time point cells on the TCPS coverslips were fixed with 4% formalin and \n\nthe nuclei stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate, DAPI blue (100 ng.mL-1; Molecular \n\nProbes), for assessing possible cell morphological changes. Fluorescence was protected by using an \n\nantifade agent (ProLong\u00ae Antifade Kit, Invitrogen, USA), following the supplier procedure and cells \n\nwere observed under the fluorescence microscope (AxioImager Z1, Zeiss Inc., Germany). \n\nRBMSCs were isolated from rats and expanded until reaching 80% of confluency. The RBMSCs (P1) \n\nwere trypsinized and transferred to a 6-well (1 x 105 cells.well-1) and a TCPS coverslips in 24-well TCPS \n\nplates (2 x 104 cells.well-1) for analysis under FACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. For \n\nfluorescence microscopy, RBMSCs were cultured in a MEM complete culture medium containing the  \n\n0.1 mg.mL-1 FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles for a period of 12 hours until 14 \n\ndays. For FACS analysis RBMSCs were cultured in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 FITC-labeled \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. The samples for \n\nfluorescence microscopy were prepared as follows: each well was washed with 1 mL of PBS, and cells \n\nfixed with 4% formalin (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) for 10 minutes at 4\u00baC followed by washing each well \n\ntwice with PBS. After that cells were incubated with 0.5 mL of PBS containing Texas Red?-X phalloidin \n\n(Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA) and Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen, USA) for staining the actin \n\nfilaments of the cytoskeleton and nuclei of cells, respectively. The protocols provided by the supplier \n\nwere followed with few modifications. The permeabilization of cells with Triton? X-100 was not carried \n\nout to avoid any undesired effect over the integrity of cells nuclei. TCPS coverslips were washed once \n\nwith PBS and fluorescence protected using the ProLong\u00ae antifade kit. The specimens were observed \n\nunder a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). FACS analysis was carried \n\nout as follows: each well of the 6-well plate was washed with 2 mL of PBS. Then, PBS was aspirated \n\nand cells released from substratum as described above. Afterwards, it was added to each well 3.5 mL of \n\nMEM complete medium and samples transferred to a 15 mL Falcon tube. After centrifugation at 900 rpm \n\nfor 5 min, cells were re-suspended in 0.5 mL of complete culture medium and passed through cell \n\nstrainers [66]. Afterwards, 1 ?L propidium iodide (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) was added to each sample for \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 120 - \n \n\ndetermining the number of live cells. After this step, cells were loaded in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer \n\n(BD Biosciences Imunocytometry Systems, USA) and analyzed with a minimum of 10,000 events \n\ncounting. Calibrite beads three-color kit (BD CaliBRITETM beads, USA) was used to adjust the \n\nequipment instrument settings before samples are run on the flow cytometer. Finally, the FACS data \n\nwas treated using the FLOWJO software. \n\n5.6.2. Immunocytochemistry \n\nFor internalization studies using neurons and glial cells, immunocytochemistry studies were also carried \n\nout. The cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, permeabilized by incubation with \n\n100% methanol for 2 minutes, and washed three times in PBS. Cells were then blocked with 10% \n\nFBS/PBS (60 minutes), followed by a 1 hour incubation with the following primary antibodies: mouse \n\nanti-rat microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP-2) (Sigma, USA, 1:500) to detect mature hippocampal \n\nneurons, rabbit anti-rat glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) (Dako, Denmark, 1:500) for astrocytes, mouse \n\nanti-CD11b (BD Biosciences Pharmigen, USA, 1:100) for microglial cells and mouse anti-O4 (R&amp;D \n\nsystems, USA, 1:50) for oligodendrocytes. Cells were then washed in PBS and incubated with the \n\nsecondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Alexa Fluor goat \n\nanti-rabbit 488 (Molecular Probes, USA) for 60 minutes. The primary antibody was omitted to produce \n\nnegative controls. Samples were further observed under an Olympus BX-61 Fluorescence Microscope \n\n(Olympus, Germany). Levels of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization by \n\nthe different cell populations was quantified by determining the rate between the number of positive cells \n\nfor FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM internalization and the total number of cells (n=3, 5 random fields per \n\ncoverslip). \n\n5.7. INVESTIGATION OF THE MECHANISM OF INTERNALIZATION OF FITC-LABELED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER \n\nNANOPARTICLES  \n\nFor the investigation of the mechanism by which dendrimer nanoparticles are internalized by cells \n\nrestrictive molecules were used, namely colchicine and apyrase known for inhibiting endocytosis and \n\nthe active nuclear translocation, respectively. A cell suspension of RBMSCs (P1) in MEM complete \n\nculture medium was transferred to a 6-well (1 x 105 cells.well-1) and TCPS coverslips in 24-well TCPS \n\nplates (2 x 104 cells.well-1) for analysis under FACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Stock \n\nsolutions of 10 U.mL-1 apyrase (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) and 10 \u00b5M colchicine (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) \n\nwere prepared in a phosphate-buffered saline solution. Cells were incubated in standard culture \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 121 - \n \n\nconditions and after 24 hours, the culture medium was replaced by a different complete culture medium \n\ncontaining the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (0.01 mg.mL-1 and 0.1 mg.mL-1), \n\nand in the presence of 1 \u00b5M colchicine and 0.1 U.mL-1 apyrase or both, for a period of 12 hours to 14 \n\ndays. Controls for internalization were performed by culturing RBMSCs in complete culture medium and \n\nin the presence of both colchicine and apyrase. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. After each \n\ntime period, specimens were prepared as described previously. The tendency of FITC-labeled \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to be internalized by RBMSCs was investigated by means of \n\nFACS analysis.  \n\n5.8. IN VITRO OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION STUDIES \n\nFor the evaluation of osteogenic differentiation of the RBMSCs cultured in the presence of Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, in vitro: RBMSCs were isolated from F344/N rats and \n\nexpanded as described before. RBMSCs (P1) were cultured in a TCPS 24-well plate at a cell density of \n\n2 x 104 cells.well-1, and cultured in a complete MEM medium for 24 hours. After that time, culture \n\nmedium was replaced by the different culture media, and RBMSCs cultured for times up to 14 days. The \n\neffect of the concentration of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles loaded with Dex on the RBMSCs \n\nosteogenic differentiation was investigated. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were \n\ndissolved in MEM medium supplemented with 0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) \n\nand 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate at a final concentration of 0.01 and 1 mg.mL-1. RBMSCS were also \n\ncultured in a complete MEM medium, complete MEM medium containing 1 mg.mL-1 of CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles, and complete MEM medium containing 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (negative \n\ncontrols). Complete MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 mM ?-\n\nglycerophosphate was used as the positive control for osteogenic differentiation. Culture media were \n\nchanged every 2-3 days. All experiments were carried out 3 times using a minimum of 4 replicates per \n\nexperimental condition. \n\nMoreover, the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs seeded onto the surface of the HAp and SPCL \n\nscaffolds and cultured with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was also investigated. \n\nRBMSCs were isolated and expanded as mentioned above. HAp and SPCL scaffolds were placed in \n\neach well of a 96-well TCPS plate. Then, 1 x 106 RBMSCs (P1) were added per each HAp and SPCL \n\nscaffold, and the constructs were cultured in complete MEM medium under standard culture conditions \n\nfor the period of 12 hours to allow cell adhesion. After that time, cell-scaffold constructs were transferred \n\nto a non-treated and non-protein coated flat bottom 12-well TCPS plate (Nunc, Japan), the different \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 122 - \n \n\nculture medium was added, and RBMSCs were cultured for times up to 14 days. RBMSCs were \n\nexposed to a MEM medium supplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate. \n\nRBMSCS were also cultured in a complete MEM medium (negative control for osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation). A complete MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 \n\nmM ?-glycerophosphate was used as the positive control for osteogenic differentiation. All experiments \n\nwere carried out 3 times using a minimum of 3 replicates per experimental condition.  \n\n5.8.1. Qualitative analysis of mineralization  \n\nFor 2-D in vitro studies (Chapter VI), Alizarin red S staining was performed to investigate possible \n\ncalcium deposition after 14 days of culturing. RBMSCs were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 95% \n\nethanol for 15 minutes. The fixed cells were then washed once with PBS and stained with 5 mg.mL-1 \n\nAlizarin red S in PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. Then, it followed a washing step with ultra-pure \n\nwater and mounting with Crystal/MountTM (BiomedaCorporation, USA) for observation under the phase \n\ncontrast microscope (Olympus CK40, Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). \n\nFor the 3-D in vitro studies (Chapter VIII),  RBMSCs-HAp and -SPCL scaffolds constructs were washed \n\ntwice with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution and cells fixed with 95% ethanol for 15 minutes [67]. The fixed \n\ncells were then washed once with PBS and stained with 5 mg.mL-1 Alizarin red S in Ca and Mg-free \n\nPBS solution for 5 minutes at room temperature. After a washing step with ultra-pure water, RBMSCs-\n\nscaffold construct specimens were examined under a 3-D fluorescence microscope. \n\n5.8.2. Quantitative analysis of mineralization (calcein uptake) \n\nThe degree of mineralization was quantitatively and qualitatively investigated following the method \n\ndescribed by Uchimura et al. [68]. Succinctly, the method consists on the culturing of the RBMSCs in the \n\npresence of 1 ?g.mL-1 of calcein (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan), which is incorporated in the mineralized \n\nextracellular matrix and allow us to investigate the calcium deposition.  After each time period, each well \n\nwas washed twice with PBS after which 1 mL of PBS was added. The fluorescence of calcein \n\nincorporated into the mineralized matrices was both visualized and quantified in a image analyzer \n\nequipment (Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager, Amersham Biosciences, USA) using a 526 nm short \n\npass filter. Afterwards, the fluorescence of the incorporated calcein was also observed under a \n\nfluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, OLYMPUS Co. Ltd., Japan). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 123 - \n \n\n5.8.3. Qualitative analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \n\nFor the 2-D in vitro studies (Chapter VI), ALP staining the RBMSCs were washed twice the wells with \n\nPBS, after each culture period. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) for \n\n15 minutes at 4\u00baC and then washed twice with AMP buffer (56 mM of 2-amino-2methyl-1,3-propanediol \n\nin ultrapure water, pH 9.9). It followed the soaking step with staining solution 0.5 mg naphtol AS-MX \n\nphosphate and 0.5 mg fast red violet LB salt per mL, in AMP buffer. Cells were incubated for 10 minutes \n\nat room temperature, washed with PBS and mounted (BiomedaCorporation, USA) for observation under \n\nthe phase contrast microscope. \n\nFor the 3-D in vitro studies (Chapter VIII), ALP staining the RBMSCs-HAp and -SPCL scaffold \n\nconstructs were washed twice with PBS, after 14 days of culturing. Cells were fixed with 4% \n\nparaformaldehyde/Ca and Mg-free PBS solution for 15 minutes at 4\u00baC. The RBMSCs-scaffold construct \n\nspecimens were washed twice with AMP buffer and then soaked with staining solution 0.5 mg naphtol \n\nAS-MX phosphate and 0.5 mg fast red violet LB salt per mL, in AMP buffer. RBMSCs-scaffold construct \n\nspecimens were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS \n\nsolution and examined under a 3-D fluorescence microscope.  \n\n5.8.4. Quantitative analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \n\nGBMSCs osteoblastic differentiation was investigated by determining the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) \n\nactivity (Chapter V). GBMSCs-HAp scaffold constructs used for DNA quantification assay were used to \n\ndetermine ALP levels. As cells were lysed during the above mentioned procedure, both DNA and other \n\nproteins produced by the cells were in suspension in the supernatant solution. So, to each well of a    \n\n96-well plate were added 20 \u00b5L of sample plus 60 \u00b5L of substrate solution consisting of 0.2% (w/v)      \n\np-nytrophenyl phosphate in a substrate buffer: 1 M diethanolamine HCl (Merck, Germany), at pH 9.8. \n\nThe plate was then incubated in the dark for 45 minutes at 37\u00baC. After the incubation period, 80 \u00b5L of a \n\nstop solution (2 M NaOH containing 0.2 mM EDTA) was added to each well. Standards were prepared \n\nwith 10 \u00b5mol.mL-1 p-nytrophenol, pNP and the stop solutions in order to achieve the final concentrations \n\nranging between 0 and 0.3 \u00b5mol.mL-1. Triplicates were made for each sample and standard. \n\nAbsorbance was read at 405 nm and sample concentrations were read off from standard graph.  \n\nIn a different study (Chapter VI), ALP was also measured to evaluate osteoblast differentiation of \n\nRBMSCs cultured in the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. The \n\nsamples used for DNA quantification assay were used to determine ALP levels. Prior to analysis the \n\nsamples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was added \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 124 - \n \n\nan aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate substrate (ZYMED\u00ae Laboratories, Invitrogen, \n\nUSA). The plate was then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 37\u00baC. After the incubation period, the \n\nreaction was stopped with 1 M NaOH. Standards were prepared with pNP. Triplicates were made for \n\neach sample and standard. Absorbance was read at 405 nm (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life \n\nand Analytical Sciences, USA), and sample concentrations were read off from the standard graph. \n\nEnzyme activity was expressed either as nmol of pNP released/well/30 minutes and normalized by DNA \n\ncontent. \n\nFor quantification of ALP activity in 3-D systems (Chapter VIII), i.e. RBMSCs-HAp and RBMSCs-SPCL \n\nscaffolds, the remaining sonicated suspensions obtained from the DNA quantification assay were used. \n\nPrior to analysis the samples were sonicated once and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4?C. \n\nTo each well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate \n\nsubstrate (ZYMED\u00ae Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA), was added following the method described \n\nelsewhere [60] with minor modifications. Enzyme activity was determined as described above, expressed \n\nas nmol of pNP released/scaffold/30 minutes and normalized by DNA content. \n\n5.8.5. Immunocytochemistry \n\nImmunocytochemistry technique was used for evaluating the GBMSCs osteogenic differentiation after \n\nculturing onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds (Chapter V). GBMSCs-HAp scaffold constructs in an \n\nAccustain formalin solution, 10% neutral buffered for 1 hour at 4\u00baC, washing with PBS and including the \n\nconstructs into methacrylate blocks. These blocks were cut into 10 ?m thick slides and kept overnight at \n\n80\u00baC before being used for subsequent immunocytochemistry analysis. The procedures \n\nimmunocytochemistry were carried out following the instructions included in commercial kit: the RTU \n\nVector Stain kit \u2013 Universal Elite ABC kit PK7200 (Vector Laboratories Inc., USA). This kit was used \n\nwith a Peroxidase Substract Kit \u2013 DAB SK4100 (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, USA). For this \n\nstudy, samples were incubated with collagen type I (1/100, Chemicon, USA) for 1.6 hours and the \n\nbiotinylated secondary antibody was incubated for 1 hour prior to wash and incubate the constructs with \n\nDAB for about 6 minutes. Also an osteopontin antibody (1/100, rabbit polyclonal to osteopontin, Abcam, \n\nUK) was tested using slides from the same constructs. Although in this particular case, a fluorescent \n\nsecondary antibody was used instead of a biotinylated one and kept overnight at 80\u00baC. The \n\nmethacrylate sections were incubated with osteopontin antibody, washed and then Alexa Fluor 488 \n\nsecondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, UK) was added to GBMSCs-HAp scaffold constructs. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 125 - \n \n\nThe incubation periods used were the same for both collagen type I and osteopontin antibodies. The \n\nobservation of the constructs was performed using an Axio Imager Z1 microscope (Zeiss, Germany). \n\n5.8.6. Osteocalcin content determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) \n\nOsteocalcin content was also determined to evaluate osteoblast differentiation of RBMSCs cultured in \n\nthe presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (2-D system, Chapter VI). The \n\nsamples used for ALP activity were treated with a 20% formic acid solution immediately after concluding \n\nthe assay and stored at 4?C for 2-3 days. Then, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 minutes \n\nat 4?C and the supernatant passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE healthcare, Sweden) for \n\ndesalting. The filtered samples were concentrated in a SPD SpeedVac\u00ae equipment attached to a UV \n\nVacuum System (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA), prior to osteocalcin quantification. Finally, the \n\nosteocalcin content was determined by performing an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and using \n\na Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., USA). The experimental procedure \n\nwas carried out following the instructions provided by the supplier. A 100 ng.mL-1 standard solution of \n\nhuman osteocalcin was used to construct the standard curve. Data was read off from the standard \n\ngraph and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per ?g of DNA. \n\nFor quantification of osteocalcin content in the 3-D systems (Chapter VIII), i.e. RBMSCs/HAp and \n\nRBMSCs/SPCL scaffolds, the remnants of each sample used for the ALP/DNA assays were treated with \n\na 20% formic acid solution and stored at 4?C for 2-3 days. After that time, samples were centrifuged at \n\n15,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4?C. The supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column \n\n(GE healthcare, Sweden) for de-salting, and concentrated in order to carry out the ELISA assay. A Rat \n\nOsteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., MA, USA) was also used following the \n\ninstructions provided by the supplier. Once, data was read off from the standard curve obtained with \n\nhuman osteocalcin and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per ?g of DNA. \n\n5.9. IN VITRO CHONDROGENIC DIFFERENTIATION STUDIES \n\n5.9.1. Quantification of glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) \n\nGBMSCs chondrogenic differentiation onto the surface of CHT scaffold constructs was also investigated \n\n(Chapter V). Glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) quantification assay [69] was used to determine extracellular \n\nchondrogenic matrix formation after day 7, day 21 and day 28 of chondrogenic medium culture. \n\nGBMSCs-CHT scaffold constructs used for this assay were the same used for ALP and DNA assays. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 126 - \n \n\nGAGs standards were obtained by preparing a chondroitin sulphate solution ranging from 0 and           \n\n30 \u00b5g.mL-1. In each well of a 96-well plate, 20 \u00b5L of sample or standard were added in triplicates and \n\nthen 250 \u00b5L per well of dimethylmethylene blue (DMB) was added and mixed. The optical density was \n\nmeasured immediately at 525 nm on a microplate ELISA reader. A standard curve was created and \n\nGAGs sample values were read off from the standard graph. \n\n6. IN VIVO STUDIES  \n\n6.1. IMPLANTS \n\nFor the in vivo studies, RBMSCs were expanded in different culture media namely, MEM, MEM \n\nsupplemented with Dex and MEM supplemented with the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles. Then, the respective RBMSCs at different cell numbers (1 x 106 and 2 x 105) were \n\nseeded onto the surface of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds, cultured overnight for cell adhesion and then \n\nconstructs were implanted subcutaneously and retrieved after 2 and 4 week of implantation (Figure 8). \n\nHAp and SPCL scaffolds without RBMSCs were also implanted (controls).  \n\nIn vitro: expansion of \nRBMSCs in the presence of\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles\n\nIn vivo: \n\nsubcutaneous \n\nimplantation\n\nWeek 1 Week 5\n\nSeeding \n\nOvernight\n\nF344/N rats\n\n?\n\nDay 0\n\nIsolation of \nRBMSCs\n\n(scaffold/RBMSCs constructs)F344/N rats TCPS dish\n\n \n\nFigure 8.

SURGICAL PROCEDURE \n\nSeven-week-old male Fischer 344 rat (Syngeneic F344/N rat), same as donor sub-strain and age, were \n\nanesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Nembutal, Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 127 - \n \n\nJapan) at a final concentration of 3.5 mg per 100 g of body weight. The hair of the rat was cut at the \n\nimplantation area, followed by washing with tap water and scrubbed with tincture of iodine and 70% \n\nethanol. In each rat, three or four skin incisions (each 1 cm length) on the dorsal midline below the ear \n\nwere made. Each RBMSCs-HAp and -SPCL constructs was implanted subcutaneously (1.5 to 2 cm \n\naway from the midline at both right and left sides) into the respective pocket and skin sutured. As a \n\nnegative control, we used HAp and SPCL implants without RBMSCs. No prophylactic medication was \n\nadministered post-surgery. After 2 and 4 weeks implantation, the animals were sacrificed with an \n\noverdose of anesthetic and RBMSCs-HAp and -SPCL constructs and controls were retrieved from the \n\nback of the F344/N rats. All experiments were carried out 3 times. \n\n6.3. EXPLANTS CHARACTERIZATION \n\n6.3.1. Micro-computed tomography (\u00b5-CT) and morphometric analyses  \n\nNew bone formation in the retrieved implants or explants was investigated by micro-computed \n\ntomography analysis (?-CT: MCT-CB 100MF(Z); Hitachi Medical Corp., Tokyo, Japan). After 2 and 4 \n\nweeks of implantation, construct were retrieved, rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 10% formalin at room \n\ntemperature, overnight. For the HAp-based constructs (Chapter IX), the explants were placed on the flat \n\nsurface for analysis under the ?-CT. X-ray scans were acquired with a resolution mode of 10 \u00b5m (x/y/z) \n\nat 50 kV and 150 ?A. The analytical conditions were: precision mode, 7 times magnification with an \n\nimage intensifier field of 4.57 cm [70]. CT reconstruction has carried out using the 3D Bone Morphometry \n\n(TRI/3D-Bon, RATOC System Engineering Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) software for evaluate the 2-D \n\ndistribution of newly formed bone within the pores of the implanted constructs. Morphometric analysis \n\nwas carried out using the public domain image-processing program IMAGE J (National Institutes of \n\nHealth, Bethesda, MD) to obtain quantitative evaluation of histological section of bone. The light \n\nmicroscopy photographs of the 2-D histological decalcified sections of the HAp-based explants (Chapter \n\nIX) were converted to gray-value images and several filter steps were performed [71]. Shrinkage \n\npercentage observed in decalcified sections [70] was not considered in the calculations. New bone \n\nformation (NB) was expressed as a percentage of bone volume density (BV/TSV, Bone volume/Tissue \n\nplus Scaffold volume) \u00b1 standard deviation. A minimum of 12 sections per implant were analyzed. \n\nFor the SPCL-based constructs (Chapter X), new bone formation in the explants was evaluated with a \n\nhigh-resolution \u00b5-CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, Belgium) and using a resolution of pixel \n\nsize of 6.59 ?m and integration time of 1.7 ms. The X-ray source was set at 40 keV of energy and 250 \n\n?A of current. Approximately 400 projections were acquired over a rotation range of 180\u00b0 with a rotation \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 128 - \n \n\nstep of 0.45\u00b0. Data sets were reconstructed using standardized cone-beam reconstruction software \n\n(NRecon v1.4.3, SkyScan). The output format for each sample was 500 serial 1024x1024 bitmap \n\nimages. Representative data sets of 250 slices were segmented into binary images with a dynamic \n\nthreshold of 220-255 (grey values) to access the new bone formation in the explants. The same \n\nrepresentative volume of interest (VOI) was analysed for all the samples. These data sets were used for \n\nmorphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan) and to build the 3-D models (ANT 3D creator, \n\nv2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric analysis included scaffold characterization such as porosity and \n\ninterconnectivity, histograms and new bone formation quantification. The distribution of this new bone \n\nformation in the scaffolds was assessed by 3-D virtual models that were created, visualized and \n\nregistered using both image processing software\u2019s (CT Analyser and ANT 3D creator). \n\n6.3.2. Histological evaluation \n\nAfter ?-CT analyses, the explants were decalcified with K-CX solution (Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for \n\nhistological analysis. Firstly, the explants were dehydrated in an ascending series grade ethanol/water \n\nsolution (from 90-100%) using an automatic machine for 19 hours followed by washing three times with \n\nxylene. Secondly, specimens were immersed in paraffin at 62\u00baC and allowed to solidify at -5\u00baC. Slides \n\nwere prepared by cutting the specimens into sections 5 ?m thick using a microtome, and mounted in a \n\nmicro-slide glass (Matsunami glass Ind. Ltd., Japan). Then, paraffin was melt by placing the slides in the \n\noven at 71\u00baC for 20 minutes and allowed to let cool down at room temperature. The remnant paraffin \n\nwas then eliminated off in hexane for 5 minutes (S.T. Chemical, Japan), followed by dipping into a \n\nethylene/propylene mixture (Clear Plus, Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 3 minutes. Finally, slides were \n\nimmersed three times in 100% ethanol for 2 minutes each time of immersion.   \n\n6.3.2.1. Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) staining  \n\nFor the Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) staining, slides were sequentially transferred to a 90% ethanol and \n\nthen to a 70% and washed with tap water. It followed the staining step, which consisted in the \n\nimmersion of the slides into the GM\u2019s Haematoxylin dye (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan, \n\nN\u00ba 3008-1) for 10 minutes. It followed the washing step with tap water for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, slides \n\nwere rinsed with de-ionized water and immersed in a 70% ethanol solution. Finally, slides were \n\nimmersed in Eosin dye (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan, N\u00ba 3204-2) solution for 2 minutes \n\nand dehydrated in a series of ethanol grades (70, 90, and 100%). At last, the specimens were immersed \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n\n- 129 - \n \n\nthree times in an ethylene/propylene mixture and then mounted avoiding the formation of bubbles for \n\nobservation. \n\n6.3.2.2. Toluidine blue staining \n\nFor Toluidine blue staining, paraffin was melt and slides rinsed with ultrapure water. The ground \n\nsections were stained with 0.05% Toluidine blue (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for 30 \n\nminutes. Finally, the slides were dehydrated in a series of ethanol grades (70, 90, and 100%) and \n\nmounted for further observation. All slides were examined under a light microscope (Olympus DP70, \n\nOlympus Co. Ltd, Japan). 2-D histological sections were obtained for bone specimens used in the \n\nmicro-tomography analysis. \n\n6.3.3. Quantification of ALP \n\nAlkaline phosphatase activity was measured to evaluate osteoblast differentiation, in vivo (Chapters IX \n\nand X). Prior to the assay, the explants were washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution. Then, implants \n\nwere transferred to a 2 mL eppendorf and pulverized with zirconia\u2019s balls as previously reported [61]. \n\nPrior to analysis the samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4?C. To \n\neach well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate substrate \n\n(ZYMED\u00ae Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA) [60]. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at \n\n37\u00baC and after that time the reaction was stopped with 1 M NaOH (Panreac). Standards were prepared \n\nwith pNP. Triplicates were made for each sample and standard. Absorbance was read at 405 nm \n\n(Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA), and sample concentrations \n\nwere read off from the standard graph. Enzyme activity was expressed either as nmol of pNP \n\nreleased/explant/30 minutes. \n\n6.3.4. Quantification of osteocalcin \n\nThe remnant of each sample used for the ALP assay of the explants, was treated with a 20% formic \n\nacid solution and stored at 4?C for 2-3 days (Chapters IX and X). Afterwards samples were centrifuged \n\nat 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4?C. Then, the supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 \n\ncolumn (GE healthcare, Sweden), subsequently concentrated for performing the Enzyme-linked \n\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA). A Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., \n\nMA, USA) was used following the instructions provided by the supplier. Data was read off from the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER II. Materials and methods  \n\n \n \n- 130 - \n \n\nstandard curve obtained with human osteocalcin and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per \n\nexplant. \n\n6.3.5. Calcium assay \n\nAs an index of mineral bone formation, deposited calcium in the SPCL-based explants (Chapter X) was \n\nquantified as described by Kim et al. [72,73], with minor modifications. Briefly, SPCL-based explants were \n\nrinsed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution and 0.2 mL of 1N HCl per explants was added.  The tissues \n\nwere chopped before being placed on an orbital shaker to extract calcium for 12 hours. Then, mixtures \n\nwere centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes and supernatants were assayed using a commercial \n\ncalcium assay kit (Calcium C-test\u2122, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) and following the \n\ninstructions provided by the supplier. \n\n7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  \n\nStatistical evaluation was performed using one way ANOVA (internalization times experiments) and two-\n\ntailed paired t-student tests (MTS, total protein, comparison between renovation and non-renovation of \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture media), to assess the statistical differences \n\nbetween different groups. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 for a 95% confidence interval.  \n\nResults of in vitro cytotoxicity screening of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were also \n\nanalyzed for statistical significance using Student\u2019s t-test with the JMP 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute, \n\nCary, N.C.). \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

The obtained results \n\nrevealed that the pores of the scaffold were regular, interconnected and possess a size comprised in the \n\nrange of 20 to 500 ?m. Furthermore, the Fourier-transform infra-red spectrum of the composite \n\nscaffolds exhibited all the characteristic peaks of apatite, and the appearing of typical bands from \n\nCMCht, thus showing that co-precipitation of both organic and inorganic phases was effective. The      \n\nX-ray diffraction pattern of composite scaffolds demonstrated that calcium-phosphates consisted of \n\ncrystalline HAp. From micro-computed tomography analysis, it was possible to determine that \n\ncomposite scaffolds possess a 58.9 \u00b1 6% of porosity. Moreover, the 2-D morphometric analysis \n\ndemonstrated that in average the scaffolds consisted of 24% HAp and 76% CMCht. The mechanical \n\nproperties were assessed using compressive tests, both in dry and wet states. Additionally, in vitro tests \n\nwere carried out to evaluate the water-uptake capability, weight loss and bioactive behaviour of the \n\ncomposite scaffolds. The novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds show to be \n\npromising whenever degradability and bioactivity are simultaneously desired, such as in the case of \n\nbone tissue engineering scaffolding applications. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter is based on the following publication: Oliveira JM, Costa SA, Leonor IB, Malafaya PB, Mano \n\nJF and Reis RL, 2009, Novel hydroxyapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared \n\ncombining an innovative \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 electroless co-precipitation route, Journal Biomedical Materials \n\nResearch: Part A, 88A(2): 470-480. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

INTRODUCTION \n\nThe innovative Tissue Engineering (TE) concepts promises the creation of viable substitutes for the \n\nrepair, replacement or regeneration of organs and tissues, and by this mean allowing a wide range of \n\nnovel therapeutical possibilities [1]. This area of expertise deals with three main strategies: (i) combining \n\nof living cells with specially designed biomaterials [2,3], (ii) use of cells isolated or cells substitutes [4-6], \n\nand (iii) targeted-delivery of bioactive molecules, such as growth and differentiation factors by means of \n\nusing drug-delivery carriers [7-9].  \n\nScaffold technologies play a central role on the field of TE, since the main aim of the scaffold is to act as \n\na support and guidance template for the development of a new tissue, both in vitro and in vivo [10]. \n\nTherefore, the size of the channels or pores as well as the 3-D architecture has a great effect on the cell \n\nseeding, infiltration and consequently on the tissue regeneration [11-13]. For instances, when engineering \n\nbone tissue, the scaffolds should meet other important criteria. It must be biocompatible [14], \n\nbiodegradable in an appropriate time window, its degradation products should be non-toxic and easily \n\neliminated by the metabolic pathways, support cell adhesion and growth, and possess adequate \n\nmechanical stability [1,10,15-18]. Moreover, the material should induce bone formation (osteoinductive) in \n\naddition to allow new bone ingrowths (osteoconductive) [19], while facilitating the angiogenesis [1,10] to \n\nsupply with nutrients the newly formed tissue.  \n\nIn recent years, great efforts have been made towards the development of new synthetic skeletal \n\nsubstitute products [20-22]. Among these, bioceramics and polymeric scaffolds have attracted much \n\nattention, such as hydroxylapatite (HAp, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2) [23,24]  and chitosan [25,26], respectively. \n\nAlthough, since there is not yet a single material that fulfils all the necessary requirements for bone \n\ntissue engineering scaffolds [27] composites have been developed [27-34]. Mechanical properties is one of \n\nthe great advantages of composites, i.e. usually show a good balance between strength and toughness \n\n[17], but their improved osteoconductivity and biodegradability are also interesting [33]. From this point of \n\nview, composites materials are a better choice for such type of applications [35,18]. Bearing these \n\npremises in mind, Reis et al. [36] have been focusing its efforts at create innovative TE composite \n\nscaffolds based on natural-derived polymers and ceramics.  \n\nCarboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) is a biocompatible and biodegradable chitin or chitosan-derivative \n\npolymer [37] There are several types of carboxymethylated chitosans, which can be prepared through \n\ndifferent methods [38,39] Of particular interest is the fact that contrarily to chitin and chitosan, CMCht is a \n\nwater-soluble polymer [38,40]. Its versatility allowed many applications, namely as metal ion chelating \n\nagents [40,41], drug delivery [42,43], and medicine [44].  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared combining an innovative \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 \n\nelectroless co-precipitation route \n\n \n\n \n \n- 144 - \n \n\nMuzzarelli et al. [38] reported that chitosan do not bind significantly calcium ions. On the contrary CMCht \n\nadsorb calcium ions to an extent that is dependent on proportion of protonation or if the molecule is in \n\nsalt form of sodium. In this report an important particularity of CMCht was demonstrated. By attracting \n\nthe calcium ions it is expected that one can have an effect on the precipitation of biominerals [45], or on \n\nthe growth of the crystals either in vitro and in vivo [46,47]. \n\nHerein it is reported a co-precipitation route for the preparation of \n\nhydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan (HAp/CMCht) composite materials. This method is based on a \n\npreviously reported \u201cautocatalytic\u201d electroless bath [48,49] that has been used in our group to modify the \n\nsurface of bioinert and biodegradable polymers (Figure 1) [49] This methodology is based on the \n\npossibility of chemisorption of Palladium (Pd2+) on the surface of bioinert polymers (1), which acts as the \n\ncatalyst to induce the precipitation of calcium-phosphate on its surface (2) [50-53]. Since it is known that \n\nCMCht is able to chelate metal ions [40], we expect CMCht to bind Pd2+. As illustrated in Figure 1 the \n\nresulting excess of positive charge from the CMCht/Pd2+ complex may build up an adjacent layer of \n\nnegative charges (phosphate groups), which can originate a residual charge responsible for attracting \n\nother calcium ions. Consequently, calcium phosphate precipitation may occur on the presence of \n\nCMCht due to a local supersaturation followed by calcium phosphate nucleation [32]. In this context, we \n\nhypothesized that by means of using an acidic \u201cautocatalytic\u201d electroless bath it may became possible to \n\noccur the co-precipitation of calcium-phosphates and CMCht. \n\nAs previously highlighted the porosity of scaffolds greatly dictates the performance of a 3-D template in \n\nthe TE approaches.Therefore, the development of novel processing routes towards the fabrication of \n\nadequate porous structures is of great interest. The novelty of this work consists on the possibility of \n\ntailoring the porosity and 3-D architecture of the composite materials by means of using a wax spheres \n\nleaching methodology. The physicochemical characterization of composite scaffolds was performed by \n\nX-ray diffraction analysis, Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy, micro-computed tomography, and \n\nscanning electron microscopy attached with an X-ray detector. Complementarily, mechanical properties \n\nof composite scaffolds were determined under compression testing, in dry and wet states. \n\nIn vitro tests were carried out to assess the swelling and weight loss behaviour. The bioactive character \n\nof the composite scaffolds was also investigated by means of soaking the composite scaffolds in a \n\nsimulated body fluid (SBF) solution. The elemental composition in the SBF solution was monitored by \n\ninductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared combining an innovative \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 \n\nelectroless co-precipitation route \n\n \n \n\n- 145 - \n \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. MATERIALS \n\nReagent grade chitosan particles with a deacetylation degree of ~91% and size in the range of   \n\n125-250 ?m (Vanson, USA), monochloroacetic acid (Sigma, USA), acetic acid (Fluka, Switzerland), \n\nsodium hydroxide 40% (Merck, Germany) solution, and acetone (Pronalab, Portugal) were used in \n\nthe preparation of carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht).  \n\nCalcium chloride, CaCl2 (Merck, Germany), ortho-phosphoric acid, H3PO4 (Panreac, Spain) and \n\npalladium chloride, PdCl2 (Aldrich, USA) were used to prepare the acidic \u201cautocatalytic\u201d electroless \n\nbath, and ammonium hydroxide 33%, NH4OH (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany) solution to adjust the pH \n\nof the co-precipitation media. \n\nHydration and weight loss tests were performed using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) tablets \n\nsupplied by Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany).  \n\nThe Simulated Body Fluid (SBF) solution was prepared as previously reported by Kokubo et al. [54]. \n\nPotassium bromide, KBr (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany) suitable for spectroscopy was used to prepare \n\nde FTIR pellets.  \n\n2.2. PREPARATION OF THE COMPOSITE SCAFFOLDS \n\nCMCht was prepared by a modification of the reaction process that has been previously reported by \n\nChen et al. [55] The composite materials were prepared by a co-precipitation method using a acidic \n\n\u201cautocatalytic\u201d electroless bath [48]. The acidic electroless bath was prepared by dissolving calcium \n\nchloride with a final concentration of 5.6 g.L-1, ortho-phosphoric acid 3.4 g.L-1, and palladium chloride \n\n0.9 g.L-1 in 500 ml distilled water, under agitation. A 10 wt% CMCht aqueous solution was added to the \n\nbath using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3, France) at a speed rate 2 mL.minute-1. The composite \n\nprecipitate was obtained by means of adjusting the pH of the bath to 6 with ammonium hydroxide. The \n\nprecipitate was filtered under vacuum and the excess of water removed by drying at 37\u00baC for 24 hours. \n\nPorous structures were prepared by means of mixing the composite filtrate and 20 wt% wax spheres \n\n(Desert Whale Jojoba Company, Inc., USA), with a diameter ranging from 50-450 ?m, and transferring \n\ninto a cylindrical mould with 4-7 mm diameter and 8-22 mm height. After drying at 60\u00baC, the wax \n\nspheres were eliminated off by soaking into tetrahydrofuran (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany), in an \n\nultrasound bath, for several hours. Once composite scaffolds were allowed to dry until constant weight \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.

SWELLING AND WEIGHT LOSS STUDIES \n\nWater-uptake or swelling and weight loss of the developed composite scaffolds were performed, by \n\nsoaking into a PBS solution for times up to 30 days, in triplicate. The solution was prepared by \n\ndissolving 1 tablet of PBS in 200 mL of distilled water to obtain a final concentration of 0.0027 M \n\npotassium chloride and 0.137 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4 at 25\u00baC. The water-uptake was \n\ndetermined by the changes on the initial mass of the scaffolds (mi) after incubation in the PBS \n\nsolution at 37 ? 1\u00baC. The scaffolds were removed after 1, 3, 7, 15, 21 and 30 days of immersion, \n\nthe excess of solution removed out with a filter paper, and the mass (mw) determined using an \n\nanalytical balance. Then, scaffolds were dried at 60\u00baC until constant weight, the mass determined \n\n(md) in order to obtain the weight loss. The percentage of water-uptake of scaffolds (WUs) after \n\neach time of immersion (t) was calculated by means of using equation (1), \n\n \n\n \n\nThe percentage of weight loss of the scaffolds (WLs) after each time of immersion (t) was \n\ncalculated using equation (2), \n\n \n\n \n\n2.4. BIOACTIVITY TEST \n\nBioactivity tests were performed by soaking the scaffolds in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution at \n\n37 ? 1\u00baC. This solution contains the inorganic ion concentrations resembling to those found in \n\nhuman blood plasma and pH of 7.4 [54] for periods of time ranging from 1 to 30 days. After each \n\nsoaking time the scaffolds were removed from the SBF solution and immediately rinsed with \n\ndistilled water, dried at room temperature for 24 hours and in the oven at 60\u00baC until constant \n\nweight. The concentration of the Ca and P ions, after each soaking time, was measured by \n\ninductively-coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES, JY 70 plus, JobinYvon, France) \n\nspectrometry. Triplicate samples were analysed for each soaking time and an averaged result \n\ncalculated. \n\nWUs,t = [(mw,t-mi)/ mi] x 100  \n(1) \n\nWLs,t = [(md,t-mi)/ mi] x 100  \n(2) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared combining an innovative \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 \n\nelectroless co-precipitation route \n\n \n \n\n- 147 - \n \n\n2.5. MECHANICAL PROPERTIES \n\nCompression tests in dry state were performed using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 4505) \n\npossessing a load cell of 50 kN. A minimum number of 10 composite scaffolds were tested after storage \n\nat ~20\u00baC and 55% relative humidity, to obtain an averaged result. Tests were conducted up to failure or \n\nuntil 60% reduction in specimen height as previously reported by Boesel et al. [56]. Complementarily, \n\ncompression tests \u201cPush-out\u201d in wet state were carried out by means of using a Miniature Materials \n\nTester (Minimat Vsn 3.1, Rheometric Scientific Ltd, UK). This equipment is capable of sensing full scale \n\nload ranges from 20 N up to 1000 N at 37\u00baC. Before conducting the tests, composite scaffolds were \n\nintroduced inside the perforated stainless steel shells (6 mm of diameter and 11 mm height), and \n\nsoaked into a PBS solution for 24 hours at 37\u00baC inside an oven. Afterwards, the shells containing the \n\ncomposite scaffolds were immersed into a PBS solution at 37\u00baC and a minimum number of 5 samples \n\nwere tested. A baseline was also performed for each sample using the same experimental conditions \n\nbut running the experiments with the empty stainless steel shells. \n\n2.6. SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPY \n\nThe microstructure of the composite scaffolds before and after immersion into the SBF solution was \n\nperformed using scanning electron microscope, SEM (Leica Cambridge S-360, UK). Previously to \n\nthe elemental and microstructure analysis, specimens were coated with carbon (Fisons \n\nInstruments, Polaron SC 508, UK) and gold (Fisons Instruments, Polaron SC 502, UK), \n\nrespectively. The current was set at 18 mA with a coating time of 120 seconds. The phosphorus, \n\ncalcium, sodium, carbon and oxygen elemental analysis was achieved by means of using an X-ray \n\ndetector, EDS (Pentafet model 5526, UK) attached to the S-360 microscope, and a voltage of 10 \n\nkeV was used. \n\n2.7. FOURIER-TRANSFORM INFRA-RED SPECTROSCOPY \n\nFourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis was performed using a Perkin-Elmer spectroscope (Perkin-\n\nElmer 1600 series equipment). Transparent KBr pellets were prepared by mixing in the ratio of 1:10 of \n\nsample/KBr (wt/wt), and milling in an agate mortar, followed by uniaxially pressing the powders.

DISCUSSION \n\nPreviously, we demonstrate that carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) can react with CaCl2 in two \n\ndifferent \u201cautocatalytic\u201d electroless media containing Pd2+, namely the acid and oxidant baths, \n\nresulting in the formation of opaque dispersions [48]. By performing a potentiometric titration, it was \n\npossible to verify that CMCht precipitation occurred preferentially in the range of pH\u2019s comprised \n\nbetween ~2-6 (data not shown). In the same report, we conclude that CMCht can co-precipitate \n\nwith calcium-phosphates in a higher extent when using an acidic bath. This observation may be due \n\nto a more effective complexation of CMCht with Pd2+ ions. By this mean, we were able to produce a \n\ncomposite material, which is expected to possess improved mechanical and bioactive behaviour.  \n\nIn the present investigation, SEM studies have shown the existence of two phases on the \n\ncomposite scaffolds, i.e. an organic and the inorganic one (Figure 2C). The EDS analysis showed \n\nthat the inorganic phase consisted of calcium and phosphorus (Figure 2D). Therefore, the \n\nprecipitation of CMCht enclosed the calcium phosphate particles inside the polymer. Moreover, \n\nusing a wax spheres leaching methodology it was possible to develop 3D-macroporous structures \n\nwith tailored porosity and interconnectivity (Figures 2A-B). The average pore size was found to be \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared combining an innovative \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 \n\nelectroless co-precipitation route \n\n \n \n\n- 155 - \n \n\ncomprised between 20 to 500 ?m. Regarding materials porosity, Kaplan et al. [13] has been showing \n\nthat the range of pore size observed in the composite scaffolds will be beneficial for the cells or \n\ntissue ingrowths, and formation of capillaries.  \n\nIt has been reported [57] that the chelation of Ca2+ by the water soluble CMCht involves both \n\ncarboxymethyl group and the 3-OH of a neighboring residue. From these findings, it is expected \n\nthat the efficiency of CMCht on the Pd2+/Ca2+ chelation would be dependent not only on the state of \n\nprotonation of its carboxymethyl groups but also on the degree of substitution, i.e. percentage of \n\ncarboxymethyl groups. Therefore, the degree of substitution of CMCht will dictate the number of \n\nchelation sites. These findings are extremely important because by either changing the pH of the \n\nprecipitation bath and the initial degree of substituion of CMCht or even the molecular weight [58] we \n\nmay be able to tailor the chemical composition of the composite scaffolds, i.e. the efficiency of \n\ncalcium-phosphate co-precipitation, and ultimately its physicochemical properties.  \n\nAnother advantage of using CMCht on the development of composite scaffolds for bone tissue \n\napplications, arises from the fact that CMCht allows to incorporate a larger variety of molecules \n\n(e.g. bovine serum albumin or bone morphogenetic proteins, BMPs) from precipitating media. But \n\nmore importantly, this can be done in a wider range of pH\u2019s, which it is not possible when using \n\nchitosan, for example [59]. Therefore, we firmly believe that the herein proposed method is a \n\nfeasible route to incorporate different pH-sensitive proteins in the bulk of the composite scaffolds \n\nwithout any detriment for its activity.  \n\nStructural changes of chitosan and its derivatives were assessed by FTIR spectroscopy (Figure 3). \n\nThe overlaid IR spectra show that CMCht has been successfully synthesized from chitosan. In the \n\nregion of 3600-3000 cm-1 the chitosan, CMCht and composite scaffolds exhibit a highly convoluted \n\nIR band due to the various OH stretching contributions. The presence of characteristic absorption \n\nbands assigned to the asymmetric (as) and symmetric(s) stretching modes COO- group at        \n\n1593 cm-1 and 1417 cm-1 revealed that carboxymethylation was effective (Figures 3A-B). Previous \n\nstudies have shown that CMCht possess a substitution degree (DS) of 47% (data not shown). By its \n\nturn, the FTIR spectrum of the composite scaffolds exhibited all the characteristic peaks of apatite, \n\ni.e. the presence of phosphate absorption bands, PO43- (?3) at 1190-1020 cm-1, and the PO43- (?4) \n\nbands at 601 cm-1 and 565 cm-1 (Figure 3C). In the composite material, the appearing of a small \n\nband at 1417 cm-1 attributed to the carboxylic band, indicate that CMCht is also present. Besides, \n\nthe band observed at 1731 cm-1 is also attributed to the \u2013COOH group from CMCht. Additionally, it \n\nwas also detected the peaks corresponding to the carbonate groups, namely at 875 cm-1 attributed \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared combining an innovative \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 \n\nelectroless co-precipitation route \n\n \n\n \n \n- 156 - \n \n\nto carbonate ?2 and at 1650-1300 cm-1 assigned to carbonate ?3, which can be indicative of the \n\ncarbonate ion substitution. The presence of the carbonate ?2 and ?3 vibrational modes, in the \n\napatites may contribute to decrease the hydroxyl band, as seen in the FTIR spectra. It is known \n\nthat the ?2 sites occur competitively between the OH- and carbonate groups at the interface of \n\ngrowing crystal, whereas the ?3 sites depends on the competition between phosphate and \n\ncarbonate ions.  \n\nThe X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted to investigate the phase content and \n\ncristallinity of the developed composite scaffolds. The XRD pattern of the composite scaffolds, \n\nclearly demonstrated that the calcium phosphates peaks perfectly matched with the standard file for \n\nHAp (JCPDS 9-432; Figure 4A). The wide peak appearing approximately at 22\u00ba was assigned to \n\nCMCht (Figure 4B). Therefore, the carbonate ions detected by FTIR are assigned to surface ones, \n\nrather than to carbonate ions in the lattice of phosphate ions. It is also possible to detect the \n\npresence of halide in the composite scaffolds, which can be due to the possibility of chemisorption \n\nof Pd2+ on the surface CMCht, as initially hypothesized. Therefore this data is an indication that \n\nCMCht is able to bind Pd2+, which by its turn may promote the calcium phosphate precipitation. \n\nBesides being possible to control the CMCht precipitation, these results seems to corroborate \n\npreviously reported ones, that showed that certain acidic \u201cautocatalytic\u201d electroless bath allows to \n\ncontrol the Ca and P composition of composite, and the cristallinity of the inorganic phase [53]. \n\nBy means of performing the ?-CT analysis of the novel composite scaffolds we were able to \n\nevaluate the porosity, both qualitative and quantitatively (Figure 5). Composite scaffolds showed to \n\npossess a high pore interconnectivity. Applying a threshold 133 (T133), it was possible to \n\ndetermine that in average the scaffolds consisted of 24% HAp and 76% CMCht. By its turn, when \n\nusing the threshold 51 (T51), it was possible to calculate the porosity across the composite \n\nscaffolds. This study has shown that composite scaffolds have a porosity of 58.9 \u00b1 6%, in average. \n\nMoreover, it is also possible to observe that porosity decreases where the HAp content increases. \n\nThe reason for this observation and for the high interval of porosity may be due to the \n\nsedimentation of the HAp particles and wax spheres during the drying process. This can be \n\nprevented by agitating the moulds during the preparation of the composite scaffolds. From these \n\nresults, it can be seen that the developed composite scaffolds have an appropriate porosity to find \n\napplications as bone substitutes. The method herein proposed presents and important advantage. \n\nPorosity and interconnectivity may be easily tailored by means of varying the content and \n\ngranulometry of wax spheres. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared combining an innovative \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 \n\nelectroless co-precipitation route \n\n \n \n\n- 157 - \n \n\nBiodegradability or bioadsorbability [60] of the 3-D substrate is also an essential characteristic in TE \n\napplications. Since CMCht is a water soluble polymer we carried out in vitro tests, to determine the \n\nwater-uptake capability (swelling) and weight loss of the developed composite scaffolds. The \n\nswelling profile showed a dramatic absorption of water (480%), from first hours until day 7. This \n\nswelling behaviour is often characteristic of a hydrogel. Nevertheless, it has been reported that \n\nCMCht swelling is dependent on the pH of the media [43]. Because CMCht contains both carboxyl \n\nand amino groups, it is possible to control the swelling of the composite scaffolds to load them with \n\ndifferent proteins at different extents, for example. In fact, it has been reported that CMCht swell at \n\nlow pH (<2.0) and at pH in the range of 4.0-13.0 due to the protonated amino groups and \n\nunprotonated carboxyl groups, respectively [43]. Therefore, the swelling behaviour of CMCht is \n\naffected by both degree of deacetylation and degree of substitution. Additionally, the charge of the \n\ncomposite scaffolds can be altered due to the possibility of CMCht to bind Ca2+ or Pd2+, thus their \n\nswelling behavior is expected to be different from the typical CMCht gels.  \n\nIn respect to the weight loss it was possible to observe that composite scaffolds were stable until \n\nday 7. After 30 days, a dramatic weight loss occur (~11% in mass). These results are in agreement \n\nwith previous reported ones [43] and can be explained due to the water soluble behaviour of CMCht. \n\nMoreover, the slight decrease on the swelling of the composite scaffolds after day 15 until day 30 \n\nmay be a consequence of this dissolution behaviour. Chen et al. [43] reported that \n\ncarboxymethylchitin lose above 80% in weight after 20 days of immersion into a phosphate buffer at \n\npH 7.4. Therefore, the lower weight loss of the novel composite scaffolds suggests that this trend \n\nmay be a consequence of Ca2+ or Pd2+ ions chelation, thus resulting in the development of scaffolds \n\nmore resistant to dissolution. In this context, future work will be carried out to evaluate the effect of \n\nCa2+ or Pd2+ binding on the CMCht swelling and dissolution behaviour. A well known strategy to \n\ncontrol the swelling of the polymers consists in performing the cross-linking [61]. In this context, after \n\nco-precipitation of CMCht and hydroxylapatite one may use cross-linking agents, such as silane-\n\ncoupling agents. This strategy may allow controlling the swelling and pH-sensitivity of the \n\ncomposite scaffolds, and to improve the stability of the organic-inorganic network. \n\nThe mechanical properties of the composite scaffolds was assessed using compression tests in dry \n\nstate. A modulus of 57.3 \u00b1 7 MPa and maximum percentage strength of 51.0 \u00b1 6 MPa at ~59% of \n\nmacroporosity was obtained. Due to the high water-uptake capability of the composite scaffolds, its \n\nmechanical properties decrease dramatically after soaking into a PBS solution for 24 hours. Whilst \n\nmechanical strength of the composite scaffolds decreased after soaking into PBS solution, the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared combining an innovative \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 \n\nelectroless co-precipitation route \n\n \n\n \n \n- 158 - \n \n\nductibility increased. These tests were carried out in confined cavities to mimic as much as possible \n\nthe in vivo circumstances, i.e. at the implantation site the scaffold will be constrained by the bone \n\ncompression. Interestingly, after undergoing the mechanical solicitation, the composite scaffolds \n\nshowed a sponge-like behaviour, i.e. were capable of recover the initial shape without fracturing, \n\nthus keeping the scaffolds integrity. Based on these findings, the moldability of the composite \n\nscaffolds can be a major advantage if we take in consideration that the current orthopaedic implant \n\nmaterials such as sintered HAp are used in a hard form, thus requiring the surgeon to fit the \n\nsurgical site around the implant or the need of a material of a desired shape [30].  \n\nOther important parameters have to be taken in consideration when developing a TE scaffold. \n\nBesides other things the scaffold must be capable of drug loading and its release in a controlled \n\nmanner. In this context, Chen et al. [43] have described a reliable methodology to load CMCht based \n\npolyampholyte hydrogels with drugs by taking advantage of the high swelling behaviour. Due to \n\ncomposite scaffolds both mechanical stability in wet state and ability to form hydrogels, the authors \n\nbelieve that the herein described composite scaffolds have great advantage over other materials, \n\nnamely because possess a lower dissolution behaviour when compared with CMCht alone. \n\nIn this study, bioactivty tests were also carried out. These have shown that deposition of apatite \n\noccur after soaking 1 day in a SBF solution. A thick film covering the surface of the composite \n\nscaffolds was observed after 7 days. This bioactive behaviour may be explained by the presence of \n\nHAp in the composite scaffold, which is known to accelerate the formation of bone-like apatite on \n\nthe surface of implants [62]. The variation on calcium and phosphorus ion in SBF solution was \n\nmonitored by ICP. From Figure 9 it can be seen that both calcium and phosphorus concentration \n\ndecreased from day 1 until day 15. This trend may be a consequence of the consumption of both \n\ncalcium and phosphorus during the precipitation of the apatite layer on the surface of the composite \n\nscaffolds (Figure 8). The increase of the Ca concentration (from day 15 until day 21) may be a \n\nresult of CMCht dissolution. Moreover, since phosphate concentration remained constant, the \n\nrelease of calcium into the SBF solution can only be explained due to the release of calcium \n\nchelated to CMCht, and not due to a redissolution phenomena. Thus, this result is in agreement \n\nwith the weight loss profile. Despite, further complimentary studies are required to elucidate the fast \n\ndecrease of calcium and phosphorus in the SBF solution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER III. Novel hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds prepared combining an innovative \u2018autocatalytic\u2019 \n\nelectroless co-precipitation route \n\n \n \n\n- 159 - \n \n\n5. CONCLUSIONS \n\nThis work demonstrated that it is possible to prepare hydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan \n\ncomposite scaffolds by means of combining a novel acidic \u201cautocatalytic\u201d co-precipitation route and \n\na novel wax spheres leaching methodology. The physicochemical properties of the composite \n\nscaffolds may be tailored, especially the 3-D architecture, content in organic-inorganic phases, and \n\ndissolution behaviour. Therefore, these composite scaffolds are very promising whenever \n\ndegradability and bioactivity are simultaneously desired, such as in the case of bone tissue \n\nengineering scaffolding applications. Moreover, the novel composite scaffolds can possibly the \n\nincorporation of pH-sensitive proteins up to physiological pH, which is known to be one major \n\ndrawback of chitosan materials for such type of applications. Future work will be performed to study \n\nof cell adhesion, proliferation and screen the citotoxicity on the surface of the novel \n\nhydroxylapatite/carboxymethylchitosan composite scaffolds. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

The novelty of work consists on the possibility of obtaining porous and highly \n\ninterconnected scaffolds mimicking the sacrificial component. Our purpose consisted on evaluating the \n\nphysicochemical properties of the HAp scaffolds by means of Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy, \n\nX-ray diffraction analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) attached with an X-ray detector. The \n\nHAp scaffolds obtained possess a porosity of ~70%, and macropores diameter in the range of 50-600 \n\n?m. On the other hand, results regarding the micro-computed tomography analysis have demonstrated \n\nboth high pore uniformity and interconnectivity across the scaffolds. The compressive strength of the \n\nHAp scaffolds was found to be 30.2 ? 6.0 MPa. Bioactivity of the HAp scaffolds was assessed by \n\nimmersion into a simulated body fluid solution, in vitro. SEM observations have showed a deposition of \n\napatite on the surface of the HAp scaffolds, with a \u2018cauliflower-like\u2019 morphology after 1 day, and tend to \n\nbe more pronounced with the immersion time. The changes in calcium and phosphorus concentration \n\nwere monitored by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Cytotoxicity of the HAp \n\nscaffolds was preliminarily investigated by carrying direct observation of mouse fibroblasts cells (L929 \n\ncell-line) death in the inverted microscope and then cell viability was determined by means of carrying \n\nout a MTS assay. Complementarily, a luminescent cell viability assay based on the quantification of \n\nadenosine triphosphate was performed using rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs). A LIVE/DEAD \n\nassay and SEM analysis allowed the visualization of the RBMSCs adhesion and proliferation on the \n\nsurface of the HAp scaffolds. According to the results obtained from 3-D architecture, mechanical \n\nproperties, biocompatibility and adhesion tests, it is suggested that HAp scaffolds has potential to find \n\napplications in bone tissue engineering scaffolding. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter is based on the following publication: Oliveira JM, Silva SS, Malafaya PB, Rodrigues MT, \n\nKotokuki N, Hirose M, Gomes ME, Mano JF, Ohgushi H and Reis RL, 2008, Macroporous \n\nhydroxyapatite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications: physicochemical characterization and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

INTRODUCTION \n\nBone lesions above a critical-sized segmental defect still remain a huge challenge to reconstructive \n\nsurgery and regenerative medicine. This is mainly due to the fact that bone has a limited ability to heal \n\n[1,2]. In many clinical situations there is the need for a surgical intervention and the use of autografts [3,4], \n\nallografts or xenografts [4,5] transplantation. Still, the preferred clinical strategy is the autologous \n\ntransplantation, since avoids the problem of immune rejection [6] and the consequent administration of \n\ndrugs for immunosupression of the host [7]. Bone autografts consists on bone portions either cancellous \n\nor cortical [4], harvested from other skeletal locations, which are then transferred into the defect area that \n\nis aimed to repair [8]. Although, the limited bone graft volume available, consequent donor site morbidity \n\n[5,9] and post-operative pain [10] are seen as the major constraint in using autografts. Therefore, we can \n\nsay that the currently available treatment possibilities are far from being a truly ideal solution. To \n\ncircumvent these limitations great efforts are focused on developing implantable materials either \n\nsynthetic and natural-based to be used as implants [11-13]. For instances, synthetic materials based on \n\nhydroxylapatite (HAp), Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, have demonstrated a great potential for being used as bone \n\nsubstitutes [13-15] or fracture repair devices [16]. The great interest in using HAp or other ceramic materials \n\narises from the possibility to improve the clinical outcome due to their osteoconductive behaviour [14,17]. \n\nHowever, these biomaterials alone are not always as effective as bone autografts, since they lack the \n\nosteogenic and osteoinductive properties [18,19].  \n\nMore recently, it has been reported that by applying the tissue engineering (TE) principles [10], i.e. by \n\nseeding bone marrow stem cells into scaffolds, the so-called constructs [20] or prostheses [21] it was \n\npossible to recreate an regenerative environment at the defect area, which resulted in a more \n\nfavourable healing. Despite the important advances, a wide range of problems related with the tissue \n\nengineering approaches remains unsolved. For example, many bone tissue engineering constructs \n\ndeveloped showed that bone formation in vitro, only occurred at the surface [22]. Therefore, it seems that \n\nmuch has to be done and improvements of the cell culture techniques [23] and appropriate scaffolds \n\narchitecture are needed for developing successful constructs that can be used in the clinical practice. \n\nTherefore, there is the need for continuously improving the development of processing routes towards \n\nthe fabrication of biocompatible with adequate 3-D porous structures and mechanical properties. \n\nIn this work, we report a methodology for developing HAp scaffolds with a controllable architecture to \n\nfind applications in tissue engineering of bone scaffolding. The physicochemical characterization of the \n\nmacroporous HAp scaffolds was performed by using Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy,   \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and scanning electron microscopy attached with an X-ray detector \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV. Macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications: physicochemical characterization and \n\nassessment of rat bone marrow stromal cell viability \n\n \n\n \n \n- 170 - \n \n\n(SEM/EDS). The microstructure of the HAp scaffolds was examined using micro-computed tomography \n\n(?-CT) analysis. The mechanical properties of the HAp scaffolds were assessed under compression \n\ntesting. \n\nThe bioactive behaviour of the HAp scaffolds was assessed by immersion into a simulated body fluid \n\n(SBF) solution. The changes in calcium and phosphate concentration in the SBF solution were \n\nmonitored by inductively-coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES) spectrometry. \n\nCytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds leachables was evaluated by carrying out a cellular viability assay \n\n(MTS test) on mouse lung fibroblasts cells, which were previously in contact with the different HAp \n\nextract fluids. Rat bone marrow stromal cells adhesion and morphology were also analysed by SEM and \n\nunder a 3-D fluorescence microscope, while the cell viability and proliferation were assessed by carrying \n\nout the Luminescent and LIVE/DEAD cell viability assays.  \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. PREPARATION OF HAP SCAFFOLDS \n\nCalcium hydroxide (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany) and ortho-phosphoric acid 85% (Panreac, Spain) \n\nsolution were used to prepare separately, two precursors (Ca and P) solutions. HAp powders were \n\nobtained by adding in a controlled manner, appropriate amounts (Ca/P molar ratio of 1.67 was always \n\nused) of these solutions, using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3, France) at a speed rate                 \n\n17 mL.min-1. The precipitation of the HAp particles occurred by adjusting the pH of the media to 11 with \n\na 33% ammonium hydroxide (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany) solution. Then, precipitate was filtered under \n\nvacuum and the excess of water removed by drying the filtrate at 60\u00baC for 24 hrs. After milling the HAp \n\npellets until obtain a fine powder, the HAp scaffolds were fabricated. The procedure for obtaining the \n\nHAp scaffolds is summarized in Figure 1. Firstly, the HAp slurry was prepared by dispersing HAp \n\npowders in methanol for 48 hrs (step 1). Then, polyurethane (PU, Eurospuma SA, Portugal) cylindrical \n\nsponges (10 x 8 mm) featuring fully interconnected pores were dipped into the slurry until total \n\nimpregnation. To prevent the formation of an external skin-like layer, the impregnated PU sponges were \n\ntransferred to a centrifuge and the excess of slurry was removed by centrifuging at 60 rpm for 1 min \n\n(step 2), followed by drying at 37\u00baC, for 24 hrs (step 3) to avoid the formation of cracks. Finally, the \n\nimpregnated sponges were placed inside the furnace and the PU matrices burned at 900\u00baC for 24 hrs, \n\nfollowed by sintering the HAp scaffolds at 1300\u00baC for 3 hrs (step 4). The HAp scaffolds were allowed to \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

Figure 2 shows the \n\ntypical HAp scaffolds obtained, where replica of the PU sponge pores can be observed.  \n\n2.2. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE HAP SCAFFOLDS \n\n2.2.1. Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy \n\nPotassium bromide (KBr, Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany) was used to prepare transparent discs (1:10 of \n\nsample/KBr (wt/wt)) for Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) analysis. A Perkin-Elmer 1600 series \n\nspectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, UK) was used to record the spectra that were collected with a \n\nminimum of 32 scans and resolution of 2 cm-1. The chemical change of the HAp after sintering was \n\nexamined over a region of 4400-450 cm-1. \n\n2.2.2. Thermogravimetric analyses \n\nThermal stability and composition of the PU sponges, PU sponge impregnated with HAp before burning, \n\nand HAp scaffolds sintered at 1300\u00baC was assessed by thermogravimetric (TGA) analysis.

Bioactivity test \n\nHAp scaffolds were immersed in a simulated body fluid (SBF) solution at 37 ? 1\u00baC to assess the \n\nbioactivity, in vitro [24]. After each immersion time (1, 3, 7 and 15 days), the scaffolds were immediately \n\nrinsed with distilled water, dried at room temperature for 24 hrs and then dried in the oven at 60\u00baC until \n\nconstant weight. The concentration of the Ca and P ions in the SBF solution was also measured by \n\ninductively-coupled plasma optical emission (ICP-OES, JY 70 plus, JobinYvon, France) spectrometry. \n\nTriplicate samples were analysed for each immersion time and averaged results calculated. \n\n2.3.

Then, the tubes were transferred to a \n\nthermostatic bath at 37\u00baC and 60 rpm for the period of 3 d. Different concentrations of HAp scaffolds \n\nextracts (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%) were prepared. A latex rubber extract was used as positive \n\ncontrol. \n\nAfter reaching confluence, L929 cells were trypsinized (0.25% trypsin/EDTA solution, Sigma Chemical, \n\nUSA) from a culture flask, and a diluted cell suspension was prepared in order to achieve a cellular \n\nconcentration of 8 x 104 cells.mL-1. Afterwards, 1.6 x 104 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well \n\nplate (five replicates per sample). Cells were incubated for 48 hrs in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37\u00baC, until \n\nachieving 80-90% of confluence. Afterwards, the culture medium in each well was replaced with the \n\nextraction fluids and incubated for 72 hrs. Then, an MTS assay was performed using 3-(4, 5-\n\ndimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS, Promega, \n\nUSA), while cellular morphology was assessed by optical microscope (Zeiss-Axiovert 40, Germany). \n\nThe cell viability (%) was calculated and compared to the tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS).

Cell viability and adhesion studies \n\nRat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) were obtained from femora of 7 week-old male Fischer 344/N \n\nrats (SLC Inc. Japan). The animals were sacrificed following the protocol approved by the Ethics \n\nCommittee at the Tissue Engineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). Then, the femora\u2019s were \n\ncollected under aseptic conditions and the soft tissue eliminated. The epiphyseal regions were removed \n\nand the marrow flushed out with freshly prepared complete Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (MEM, \n\nNacalai Tesque, Japan) with 15% FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Nacalai \n\nTesque, Japan) solution, into a 15 mL Falcon. The RBMSCs were expanded in T75 cm2 (BD \n\nBiosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, USA) culture flasks in the presence of complete culture \n\nmedium and expanded under standard culturing conditions. The culture medium was changed each 2 or \n\n3 d. After cells reach confluency, 1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) solution was \n\nadded to detach the cells from the substrate. Then, complete culture medium was added and RBMSCs \n\n(passage 1, P1) were centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min.

After each time period, the ATP content \n\nwhich signals the presence of metabolically active cells was measured by means of performing a \n\nCellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay (Promega Corporation, USA). The luminescence was \n\nmeasured using opaque-walled multi-well plate in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-\n\nElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA). This assay is based on a luminescence signal that is \n\nproportional to the amount of ATP, which by its turn is directly proportional to the number of viable cells. \n\nMoreover, cell adhesion and proliferation was investigated by means of using a LIVE/DEAD viability \n\nassay kit (Molecular Probes). RBMSCs were incubated with two probes, calcein-AM (green colour) and \n\nethidium homodimer-1 (EtdD-1, bright red colour), for intracellular esterase activity and plasma \n\nmembrane integrity, respectively [27]. Then, specimens were observed under a 3-D fluorescence \n\nmicroscope (Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope, OLYMPUS Co. Ltd., Japan) and SEM.

Porosity, pore size and \n\ninterconnectivity of the biomaterial scaffolds are known to play a critical role in bone formation [28]. \n\nTherefore, among the key requirements that should be idealized, scaffolds architecture is one of the \n\nmost important features. However, the balanced porosity/mechanical performance of the scaffolds is an \n\nHAp \n\nSlurry \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

To address this issue the present \n\nwork describes a methodology for the preparation of HAp scaffolds to find applications on bone tissue \n\nengineering. These scaffolds were successfully obtained by impregnating a PU sponge with Hap \n\nparticles, followed by burning the sacrifice polymeric template and sintering the final HAp porous \n\nstructure (Figure 1). It is noteworthy that centrifugation (step 2) is a crucial for optimizing the 3-D \n\narchitecture of the scaffolds. It removes the excessive impregnation of HAp slurry and this method \n\nallows obtaining a uniform porosity across the scaffold and macro- and open pore structure. \n\nThe macroscopic appearance of the typical HAp scaffold is shown in Figure 2. It can be observed that \n\nthe HAp scaffolds retained the typical shape of the original PU sponge and possess a trabeculae-like \n\narchitecture.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

The results confirmed previous ones \n\n[29] that demonstrated, in both cases the existence of characteristic bands of HAp, namely at 598 and \n\n559 cm-1 (o), and at 1020 cm-1 (*) attributed to PO43- (?4 ) and PO43- (?3) groups, respectively (Figures \n\n3a-c). Another typical HAp band that can be observed is assigned to the stretching mode of OH group at \n\n3572 cm-1 (+). Moreover, it is also possible to observe the loosening of OH groups (?) from adsorbed, \n\nand bending mode of H2O after sintering HAp. Comparing the sintered HAp (Figure 3b) and HAp \n\nscaffolds (Figure 3c), it is possible to confirm that no differences were observed, and no characteristic \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

These findings have demonstrated that the thermal treatment of the \n\nHAp/PU sponges at 900\u00baC for the period of 24 hrs followed by sintering at 1300\u00baC proved to be \n\nadequate for the completely eliminating the PU sponges. This is particularly evident in Figure 4c, since \n\nno mass changes on the sintered HAp scaffolds were detected. \n\nIt has been reported that sintering temperatures and sintering time have great effect on sintered density \n\nof different apatites [30,31]. Therefore, by increasing the sintered density we expected to increase the final \n\nmechanical properties of the HAp scaffolds. However, it is also known that high temperatures may affect \n\nthe crystallinity and phase content of HAp [32]. Figure 5 shows the XRD pattern of HAp before and after \n\ndifferent heat treatments. Examining the XRD patterns (Figures 5a-c) and comparing with that of the \n\nstandard file for HAp from JCPDS (9-432) it can be observed that the peaks are perfectly matching. The \n\nXRD pattern of synthesized HAp was found to be amorphous (Figure 5a). After sintering the crystallinity \n\nof HAp increased and no decomposition products such as ?- or ?-tricalcium phosphates (TCP) [32] were \n\ndetected. The complementary FTIR data also revealed the presence of typical OH groups (Figures 3b-c) \n\nof the HAp [33] showing that the synthesized HAp is quite stable upon sintering of the materials at \n\n1300\u00baC for 3 hrs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

FTIR \n\nspectrum shows that carbonate ions are observed in the as synthetized HAp, the bands assigned to \n\ncarbonate ?2 and ?3, at 875 cm-1 (#) and 1650-1300 cm-1, respectively. The XRD study revealed that \n\nthe carbonate ions observed by FTIR are assigned to surface ones, rather than being embedded within \n\nthe lattice of phosphate ions [29]. To evaluate the microstructure of the HAp scaffolds, SEM analysis \n\nwere performed as shown in Figure 6. The SEM images of the PU foams evidenced an \u201copen-cell\u201d and \n\nhighly interconnected porous structure (Figures 6a-b), that facilitated the impregnation of hydroxylapatite \n\nparticulates. From figure 6c it can be observed that the architecture of the obtained HAp scaffolds is \n\nanalogous to the sacrifice template. In addition, the pore geometry is also quite similar (Figures 6b and \n\nd), showing a macroporous and highly interconnected structure with pore size comprised in the range of \n\n50-600 ?m. Such type of morphology and pore dimension has been shown to be adequate for bone \n\ntissue engineering purposes [28,34,35]. Note that the final pore architecture could be easily controlled by \n\nchanging the structure of the PU foam. These results have demonstrated that the centrifugation step is \n\nrequired to prevent the formation of an external \u201cskin-like\u201d layer, i.e. non-porous HAp layer which can be \n\na disadvantage for the cells adhesion and in-growths during seeding as well as proliferation and proper \n\nflow of culture medium [35,36].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

Figure 7a shows the 2-D morphometric analysis of the HAp \n\nscaffolds. It revealed that the mean porosity is about 67.8 \u00b1 5.0%. Additionally, it can be seen that \n\nscaffolds present a uniform architecture and pore distribution. No gaps or empty spaces were observed, \n\ni.e. the impregnation technique allows obtaining 3-D structures mimicking the PU template. As \n\npreviously mentioned, besides the need of scaffolds high porosity, the pores should be interconnected \n\nto allow the diffusion of culture medium, metabolic wastes and oxygen, and to facilitate the infiltration \n\nand proliferation of cells [37]. The transversal (Figure 7b) and longitudinal (Figure 7c) views of the HAp \n\nscaffolds, clearly showed that pore network is highly interconnected (black arrows). This result \n\ndemonstrates that the centrifugation step not only prohibits the formation of an external \u2018skin-like\u2019 layer \n\nbut also allows a uniform pore distribution and interconnectivity across the HAp scaffolds.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7. ?-CT analysis of HAp scaffolds: (a) 2-D morphometric analysis, (b) transversal view, and (c) \n\nlongitudinal view. \n\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nP\no\n\nro\nsi\n\nty\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nDistance (\u00b5m)\n\n?

Macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications: physicochemical characterization and \n\nassessment of rat bone marrow stromal cell viability \n\n \n\n \n \n- 180 - \n \n\nIt is well known that a compromise between porosity and mechanical properties exists, where higher \n\nporosity results in lower mechanical strength of the scaffold [38,39]. The compressive strength of the HAp \n\nscaffolds was found to be 30.2 ? 6.0 MPa. Previous reports have shown that for a HAp scaffolds \n\npossessing 77% of porosity compressive strength was about 17.4 MPa [40]. Therefore, as compared to \n\nothers ceramic porous structures described in literature [23,40], our data presents a good compromise \n\nbetween porosity and mechanical performance, i.e. 67.8 \u00b1 5.0% and 30.2 ? 6.0 MPa, respectively. \n\nIn the present work another issue that was address consisted on evaluating the bioactivity behaviour of \n\nHAp scaffolds, in vitro. Figure 8 shows the SEM images of the surface of HAp scaffolds before and after \n\nimmersion in SBF for 1 to 15 d. It was possible to observe the deposition of precipitates after 1 d (Figure \n\n8b), which tend to be more pronounced for longer soaking time (Figures 8c-d). The formation of these \n\nprecipitates, which were covering the whole HAp surface, resembles the \u2018cauliflower-like\u2019 morphology of \n\napatite formed in vitro, onto bioactive surfaces. Additionally, changes in calcium (Ca) and phosphorus \n\n(P) ions in SBF solution was also monitored by ICP. Figure 9 shows that Ca concentration increased in \n\nthe SBF solution in the first 24 hrs. However, it is not detected an expected increase in P concentration \n\nduring this period. This can be explained due to a fast consumption of P during apatite nucleation \n\nphase.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

These findings are in \n\nagreement with the data available in literature [41], which has been shown that HAp is bioactive in nature \n\ndue to a phenomenon involving the dissolution of calcium and phosphate ions from the HAp. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9. Profile of Ca and P ions in the SBF solution after soaking the macroporous HAp scaffolds from \n\nday 0 up to day 15. \n\nAs previously reported by Kirkpatrick et al. [42], there are several ways to assess the toxicity in vitro. In \n\nthis study, L929 cells were used for preliminarily screen toxicity.  Cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds was \n\ninitially assessed through cell death observation in the inverted microscope (Figure 10). It can be \n\nobserved that after 72 hrs in contact with a latex rubber extract (positive control), the L929 cells round \n\nup and detached from the culture substratum, which is indicative of the high cytotoxicity of the material \n\n(Figure 10b). On the contrary, when exposing to the different concentrations of HAp extract (Figures \n\n10c-f), the L929 cells exhibited a normal morphology, proliferated well and established a monolayer \n\nwhen comparing to the negative control (Figure 10a). Therefore, these preliminary results show that no \n\ntoxic traces of PU sponges remained on the HAp scaffolds, and that HAp scaffolds were biocompatible. \n\nComplementarily, cell viability was investigated by carrying out the MTS test (Figure 11). The results \n\nonce corroborated the direct observation under the microscope which showed that L929 cells were \n\nviable after contacting with the different HAp extract fluids for the period of 72 hrs.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.

In order to investigate other aspects of cytotoxicity, such as the cell/scaffold \n\ninteractions, direct contact experiments were performed on the macroporous HAp scaffolds using rat \n\nbone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs). On the other hand, for optimizing the cell seeding efficiency in \n\nrespect to cell adhesion and proliferative capacity of RBMSCs onto the macroporous HAp scaffolds \n\ndifferent cell numbers were tested.

Macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications: physicochemical characterization and \n\nassessment of rat bone marrow stromal cell viability \n\n \n\n \n \n- 184 - \n \n\nThis assay is based on a luminescence signal that is proportional to the amount of ATP, which signals \n\nthe presence of metabolically active cells. From figure 12, it can be observed that RBMSCs seeded at \n\nhigher cell numbers proliferated well and were viable after culturing onto the macroporous HAp scaffolds \n\nfor 7 d. On the contrary, the low cell density has shown to influence negatively the proliferation of \n\nRBMSCs, as observed by the low cell numbers, after 7 d of culturing. Nevertheless, the number of \n\nviable cells increased with an increase of culture time for all cell densities tested. This data shows that \n\ncell seeding efficiency increased with the increase in cell concentration. This is an expected result since \n\nit has been shown that cells needs a proper microenvironment not only with respect to 3-D scaffold but \n\nalso by means of interacting with other cells through cell-cell junctions and signaling [44,45]. Therefore, \n\nthis data demonstrated that the cell seeding conditions, namely the cell numbers needs to be optimized. \n\nThe high cell concentration used seems to be more adequate for the RBMSCs/HAp constructs fully \n\nachieve physiologic functions upon implantation.   Figure 13 shows the fluorescence microscopy images \n\nof the HAp scaffolds seeded with RBMSCs after performing a two-colour fluorescence LIVE/DEAD cell \n\nviability assay. This type of assay allows distinguishing live from dead cells because calcein-AM is \n\nenzimatically converted into calcein, which is retained within live cells and produces an intense green \n\nfluorescence. On the other hand, dead cells are stained in a bright red fluorescence since EtdD-1 only \n\nenters cells with damaged membranes and binds to nucleic acids. From the fluorescence signals it can \n\nbe observed that RBMSCs adhered, proliferated and remained viable after 7 d. Moreover, dead cells \n\nwere present in low numbers as detected by the low bright red fluorescence. Moreover, it can be seen \n\nthat RBMSCs were able to penetrate deeper into the core of the HAp scaffolds (Figure 13c). This is an \n\nimportant data since it has been shown [35,39] that cell infiltration and distribution within the whole \n\nscaffold will greatly affect the overall performance of the cells/scaffold construct. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13.

Macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications: physicochemical characterization and \n\nassessment of rat bone marrow stromal cell viability \n\n \n \n\n- 185 - \n \n\nTo further investigate the RBMSCs adhesion onto the surface of the macroporous HAp scaffolds SEM \n\nanalysis were also carried out. Figure 14 shows the SEM images of the RBMSCs on the surface of the \n\nmacroporous HAp scaffolds after 24 hrs and 7 d. It can be observed that RBMSCs aggregated and \n\nadhered onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds but presents a spherical morphology, after 24 hrs (Figure \n\n14a). The morphology and small size are typical of the cells initial anchorage stage. After a longer \n\nperiod of culturing, RBMSCs spread actively and presented a flatten morphology showing a good \n\nanchoring to the substrate by multiple lamellipodia (Figure 14b).  \n\nDespite the biocompatibility and capacity of supporting normal cellular functions, the macroporous HAp \n\nscaffolds also have to support the differentiation of the stem cells both in vitro and in vivo. It can be seen \n\nfrom figure 14 that there are no indications of osteogenic differentiation, namely the extracellular \n\nmineralized matrix cannot be detected. This is an expected result since osteogenic factors medium were \n\nnot added to culture medium. On the other hand hydroxylapatite is known to lack the osteoinductive \n\ncapacity. This is an relevant feature that needs to be met in a variety of bone related clinical strategies \n\nand to which our research groups [46,47] have been giving great deal of attention. Moreover, the present \n\ndata is promising since in future experiments, we propose to evaluate the HAp/RBMSCs constructs \n\nfunctionality, namely the ability of the HAp scaffolds to support the RBMSCs osteogenesis and bone \n\nformation, in vitro and in vivo, respectively. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14.

The preparation route was optimized for producing macroporous HAp structures \n\nwith controlled morphology, easily mediated by the architecture of the PU sponge. In vitro tests have \n\ndemonstrated that such constructs are bioactive, as observed by the formation of an apatite layer after 1 \n\nday of immersion in SBF solution. The biocompatible behaviour of the macroporous HAp scaffold was \n\ndemonstrated as evidenced by the non-cytotoxic effect over L929 cells. Moreover, the cell/material \n\ninteraction tests have shown that the rat bone marrow stromal cells adhered, proliferated well and \n\nremained viable on the macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds. More importantly, the cells were able to \n\npopulate the inner of the macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds. Therefore, the physicochemical and \n\nbiological properties of the macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds have shown to suitable for find \n\napplications in bone tissue engineering scaffolding. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

However, these strategies require the use of an appropriate scaffold architecture that can \n\nsupport the formation de novo of either bone and cartilage tissue, or both, as in the case of \n\nosteochondral defects. The later has been attracting a great deal of attention since it is considered a \n\ndifficult goal to achieve. This work consisted on developing novel hydroxylapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) \n\nbilayered scaffold by combining a sintering and a freeze-drying technique, and aims to show the \n\npotential of such type of scaffolds for being used in TE of osteochondral defects. The developed \n\nHAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were characterized by Fourier-transform infra-red spectroscopy, X-ray \n\ndiffraction analysis, micro-computed tomography, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). \n\nAdditionally, the mechanical properties of HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were assessed under \n\ncompression. In vitro tests were also carried out, in order to study the water-uptake and weight loss \n\nprofile of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. This was done by means of soaking the scaffolds into a \n\nphosphate buffered saline for 1 up to 30 days. The intrinsic cytotoxicity of the HAp scaffolds and \n\nHAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds extract fluids was investigated by carrying out a cellular viability assay \n\n(MTS test) using Mouse fibroblastic-like cells. Results have shown that materials do not exert any \n\ncytotoxic effect. Complementarily, in vitro (phase I) cell culture studies were carried out to evaluate the \n\ncapacity of HAp and CHT layers to separately, support the growth and differentiation of goat marrow \n\nstromal cells (GBMSCs) into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, respectively. Cell adhesion and morphology \n\nwere analysed by SEM while the cell viability and proliferation were assessed by MTS test and DNA \n\nquantification. The chondrogenic differentiation of GBMSCs was evaluated measuring the \n\nglucosaminoglycans synthesis. Data showed that GBMSCs were able to adhere, proliferate and \n\nosteogenic differentiation was evaluated by alkaline phosphatase activity and immunocytochemistry \n\nassays after 14 days in osteogenic medium and into chondrocytes after 21 days in culture with \n\nchondrogenic medium.

INTRODUCTION \n\nIn the skeleton, articular cartilages allows a stable movement with near frictionless and consequently act \n\nas a unique protective interface for the underlying bone. This is achieved in part, since articular \n\ncartilages resists to compressive forces due to the ability to distribute loads [1,2]. General features of \n\ncartilage tissue includes: (i) a small number of chondrocytes with low proliferation rate and having both \n\ncatabolic and anabolic functions, (ii) a high content of water where metabolites and a large amount of \n\nelectrolytes are dissolved, (iii) an abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) composed by different types of \n\ncollagens (mainly type II) and proteoglycan aggrecan, which is the main responsible for the elasticity, \n\nand (iv) possess no nerve and vascular systems [1,3]. Actually, the different cell numbers, organization \n\nand distribution, as well as organic and water content across cartilage are responsible for the existence \n\nof three distinct layers with respect to depth, i.e. superficial, middle and deep [4]. In this respect, Kuettner \n\net al. [4] have suggested that the variations among articular cartilages is mainly due to significant \n\nchanges in biochemical composition and biomechanical properties of the three layers.  \n\nIt is well known that cartilage has a limited regeneration capacity upon damage. In certain extent, this is \n\nexplained by the fact of being an avascular tissue, regenerative cells cannot migrate to the defect void \n\nunless the lesion goes beyond the subchondral bone plate [5,6]. Therefore, a regenerative response will \n\nbe only possible when it is provided an artificial access by the marrow [7]. This consideration is subjacent \n\non several clinical strategies that are currently employed on the treatment of small cartilage lesions \n\nnamely, the subchondral abrasion, Pridie perforations, micro-fracture, and transplantation of \n\nosteochondral plugs [6,8-10]. Although, in most cases after clinical intervention the repaired tissue tends to \n\ndegenerate and occur the formation of the undesired fibrocartilage [5,11,12]. More recently, it was reported \n\nan alternative approach, which consists on injecting autologous chondrocytes at the defect void [13-15]. \n\nEven though, this strategy does not avoid the excision of healthy cartilage from the joint for further \n\nexpansion of the freshly isolated chondrocytes in vitro. Despite the encouraging results, there are a few \n\ncritical requirements for the success of this approach. For example, the need to obtain high cell \n\nnumbers, while maintaining chondrocyte functions. In this respect, it is well known [16,17] that conditions \n\nfavouring maintenance of phenotype are usually different from those that favour a high cell density, and \n\nconsequently there are limitations in the number of cells obtained in vitro for subsequent clinical \n\napplication. Therefore, the low rate of success especially in large lesions and in older people, and the \n\nprocedural constraints are the major drawback of these techniques [18].  \n\nIn order to eliminate donor site morbidity, which is one the major limitation of autografts, several tissue \n\nengineered (TE) cartilaginous cell-scaffolds constructs have been proposed [19,20]. But, since we have \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Novel hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffold for osteochondral tissue engineering applications: scaffold design and its \n\nperformance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal cells \n\n \n\n \n- 196 - \n \n \n\nbeen able to gain new insights related with the role of subchondral bone, it seems obvious the \n\nenormous implications in the field of tissue engineering namely, in respect to the development of more \n\nadequate scaffolds architectures for cartilage healing. In this respect, several authors have been \n\nproposing the use of bilayered osteochondral constructs for the improved regeneration of cartilage \n\ndefects [21-23]. Basically, this conceptual approach consists on developing a single 3-D porous structure \n\nthat combines a mechanical support resembling the subchondral bone (bone-like layer), while also \n\nproviding a chondrogenic support in the top for the repairing of cartilage (cartilage-like layer) [24,25]. \n\nMaterials like hydroxylapatite (HAp) [26-28] and chitosan (CHT) [29-31] have been widely employed to \n\ndevelop suitable 3-D supports for applications in tissue engineering of bone and cartilage, respectively. \n\nTherefore, on the basis of the osteochondral approaches, the development of bilayered osteochondral \n\nscaffolds combining both HAp and CHT layers thus seems a good approach. Although, a strong \n\nmechanical interface between mineral substrate and polymer matrix is required for preventing a \n\npremature failure of the scaffold. Schek et al. [25] has been described the use of poly lactic acid (PLA) \n\nrods for connecting a HAp and PLA phases of a biphasic composite scaffold. Nevertheless, the effect of \n\nthe polymeric rods on bone and cartilage regeneration is not studied. Therefore, there is the need of \n\nmore simple and reliable strategies to manufacture bilayered scaffolds for osteochondral applications. \n\nBesides the choice of adequate materials and the optimization of the mechanical properties and \n\narchitecture for the scaffolds, TE strategies requires the use of cell sources, that should be viable in \n\nterms of clinical practice and that can be effective in new tissue formation. Research focused on tissue \n\nregeneration by means of using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is increasingly attracting a great deal \n\nof attention, since MSCs have the ability to differentiate into various mesenchymal lineages [32-34] under \n\nspecific culture conditions [35]. In fact, MSCs are one of the most promising candidates for \n\ntransplantation after seeding into tissue-engineered implants [36-39].  \n\nIn this study it is described the developmental route, physicochemical characterization and biological \n\nevaluation of novel 3-D macroporous hydroxylapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) bilayered scaffolds. HAp \n\nscaffolds (bone-like layer) were firstly produced by means of sintering. Then, the CHT porous layer \n\n(cartilage-like layer) was obtained by means of freeze-drying a chitosan solution poured onto the top of \n\nthe HAp scaffolds. The physicochemical characterization of both organic and inorganic layers was \n\nperformed by Fourier-transform infra-red (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, micro-\n\ncomputed tomography (?-CT), and scanning electron microscopy attached with an X-ray detector \n\n(SEM/EDS). The mechanical properties of the HAp, CHT porous layers and HAp/CHT bilayered \n\nscaffolds were assessed by compression tests. In vitro tests were also carried out to investigate the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

Moreover, a \n\npreliminary in vitro cultivation, proliferation and differentiation study was performed upon seeding of goat \n\nbone marrow stromal cells (GBMSCs) onto HAp and CHT layers (Phase I). GBMSCs have showed to \n\npresent high proliferation and viability rates in fresh or cryopreserved cultures. These cells are quite \n\nstable in 2-D cultures and differentiate into osteogenic and chondrogenic phenotypic cells in the \n\npresence of supplemented osteogenic and chondrogenic media, respectively. Beside that, it is possible \n\nto use an autologous approach with the goat animal model and, in future experiments, evaluate in vivo, \n\nthe osteochondral constructs functionality of HAp and CHT using marrow cells harvested from same \n\nanimal implanted with the in vitro TE construct. Relative GBMSCs viability and proliferation was \n\nassessed by MTS test and by DNA quantification, while cellular adhesion and morphology was \n\ninvestigated by SEM. Osteogenic differentiation was assessed by alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) \n\nand immunocytochemistry techniques for type I collagen and osteopontin. Glucosaminoglycans \n\nquantification assay was performed to evaluate chondrogenic differentiation. \n\nFuture studies will be designed to investigate the capacity of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds to favour \n\nsimultaneous osteoblasts and chondrocytes proliferation and differentiation upon seeding GBMSCs, \n\nleading to the formation of adequate tissue substitutes for the regeneration of osteochondral defects. \n\nWith this approach it is aimed to develop an autologous model for further implantantion in vivo. \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. SYNTHESIS OF HAP \n\nAnalytical reagent grade calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2 (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany) and ortho-phosphoric \n\nacid, H3PO4 (Panreac, Spain) were used on the synthesis of the HAp powders. An controlled drop-wise \n\nautomated apparatus was developed by means of using a peristaltic pump (Gilson Miniplus 3, France) \n\nfor adding a diluted solution of ortho-phosphoric acid to the calcium hydroxide solution, in a reaction \n\nvessel. Synthesis conditions were adjusted to obtain a stoichiometric HAp, i.e. Ca/P ratio of 1.67. After \n\ncomplete addition of the acid solution, the final pH of medium was adjusted to 11 with concentrated \n\nammonium hydroxide (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany). Vigorous stirring was continued during HAp \n\nprecipitation. The supernatant was removed after 24 hours of maturation, and the precipitate filtered \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

The resulting filtrate was dried at 60\u00baC for 24 hours and milled in a mortar until obtaining \n\na fine powder. \n\n2.2. PREPARATION OF HAP SCAFFOLDS AND HAP/CHT BILAYERED SCAFFOLDS  \n\nHydroxyapatite/chitosan (HAp/CHT) bilayered scaffolds were produced by adopting a two step \n\nprocedure. Firstly, hydroxylapatite (HAp) porous layer (bone-like layer) with 10 mm height and 8 mm \n\ndiameter were obtained by means of impregnating a polyurethane (PU) sponge with HAp powders, as \n\npreviously reported by Oliveira et al. [40]. The elimination of the organic matrix consisted on burning the \n\nimpregnated sponges in the furnace (Fornocer\u00e2mica-ATR 901, Portugal) at 900\u00baC for 24 hours, \n\nfollowed by sintering at 1300\u00baC for 3 hours, at ramp rate of 2.5\u00baC.min-1. Secondly, a 3 wt% chitosan \n\nsolution was prepared by dissolving chitosan (CHT) of medium molecular weight (Aldrich, Germany) \n\nand a degree of deacetylation of ~85% in 0.2 M acetic acid solution. The bilayered HAp/CHT scaffolds \n\nwere fabricated by placing the HAp scaffolds into cylindrical silicon moulds (20 mm x 8 mm) and \n\ntransferring the 3 wt% CHT solution. To guarantee that chitosan interpenetrated into the HAp scaffolds it \n\nwas left resting for 1 minute at room temperature. Moulds were freeze at -80\u00baC and lyophilized (Telstar-\n\nCryodos -80, Spain) up to 4 days to complete remove the frozen solvent, and allow obtaining the \n\n\u2018cartilage-like layer\u2019 on the top of the \u2018bone-like layer\u2019. Then, HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were \n\nneutralized using a 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution as previously described elsewhere [41], freeze at       \n\n-80\u00baC and once lyophilized. Finally, the resulting HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were sterilized using \n\nethylene oxide before carrying out the cell culture studies. \n\n2.3. PHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION  \n\n2.3.1. FTIR spectroscopy \n\nInfra-red spectra of specimen powders were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer \n\n1600 series equipment, USA). Prior analysis transparent KBr (Riedel-de Ha\u00ebn, Germany) pellets were \n\nprepared by mixing in the ratio of 1:10 of sample/KBr (wt/wt), followed by uniaxially pressing the \n\npowders under vacuum. All spectra were obtained between 4400-450 cm-1 at a 2 cm-1 resolution. \n\n2.3.2. XRD analysis \n\nX-ray diffractometer (Philips PW 1710, The Netherlands) employing Cu-K? radiation was used to \n\ninvestigate the cristallinity and phase content of the HAp scaffolds on powder. Data was collected from 2 \n\nto 65\u00ba 2? values, with a step size of 0.02\u00ba, and a counting time of 2 seconds.step-1.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

Surface topography characterization \n\nThe surface morphology and pore size of the HAp scaffolds and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were \n\nexamined under the scanning electron microscope attached with an X-ray detector, SEM/EDS (Leica \n\nCambridge S-360, UK). Prior to the microstructure analysis, specimens were coated with gold using a \n\nFisons Instruments Coater (Polaron SC 502, UK) with a current set at 18 mA, for a coating time of 120 \n\nseconds.  \n\n2.3.4. Micro-computed tomography \n\nThe qualitative information of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds architecture was obtained by \n\nmicrotomography imaging using the Scanco 20 equipment (Scanco Medicals, Switzerland) with \n\npenetrative X-rays of 50 keV. The X-ray scans were acquired in high resolution mode (11 \u00b5m). Mimics\u00ae \n\nsoftware (Materialise, Belgium) was used to visualize the 2-D X-ray sections images of the HAp/CHT \n\nbilayered scaffolds. From the CT data set, 300 slices of a region of interest corresponding to the \n\ninterface between HAp and CHT was used to investigate the continuity of the HAp/CHT bilayered \n\nscaffolds. A customized threshold technique was used to enhance the CHT contrast and remove noise. \n\n2.3.5. Mechanical testing \n\nCompression tests (dry state) were performed using a Universal Testing Machine (Instron 4505) \n\npossessing a load cell of 50 kN, at room temperature. The gauge length and diameter of all specimens \n\nwas 16 mm and 8 mm, respectively. Tests were conducted with a constant strain rate of 2 mm.minute-1, \n\nand up to failure or until 60% reduction in specimen height. The modulus (E) was determined by linear \n\nregression from the slopes in the initial elastic portion of the stress-strain diagram. A minimum number \n\nof 10 specimens were tested, and then E was averaged from the 10 measurements. \n\n2.3.6. Water uptake and weight loss studies \n\nWater-uptake and weight loss of the HAp scaffolds and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds were evaluated \n\nafter immersion into a phosphate-buffered saline, PBS (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) solution at pH 7.4, for \n\ntime periods up to 30 days. All experiments were conducted at 37 ? 1\u00baC, and in triplicate. Percentage of \n\nwater-uptake (WUs) after each time of immersion (t) was calculated using equation (1), where Wd and \n\nWw correspond to the weight of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds before and after immersion into PBS \n\nsolution, respectively: \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

IN VITRO CELL CULTURE STUDIES \n\n2.4.1. Cytotoxicity screening \n\nMTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) test \n\nwas performed to determine the cytotoxicity of HAp porous scaffolds and HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds \n\nleachables that might result from the processing methodology used to obtain the HAp scaffolds and/or \n\nleachables of the polymeric component of the bilayered materials. Mouse fibroblastic-like cells (L929 \n\ncells; ECACC, UK), were cultured in basic medium: D-MEM (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium, \n\nSigma-Aldrich, USA) without phenol red supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, FBS (Gibco, UK) \n\nand antibiotic-antimycotic (1% A/B, Gibco, UK) solution containing 10,000 units.mL-1 penicillin G \n\nsodium, 10,000 ?g.mL-1 streptomycin sulphate and 25 ?g.mL-1 amphotericin B as Fungizone\u00ae in 0.85% \n\nsaline. L929 cells were incubated at 37\u00baC in an atmosphere containing 5% of CO2, and after achieving \n\nconfluence a cell suspension was prepared with a concentration of 8 x 104 cells.mL-1 and seeded onto \n\n96-well plates. L929 cells were incubated for 3 days with different concentrations of HAp and HAp/CHT \n\nbilayered scaffolds extracts (25%, 50%, 75% and 100%). Eight replicates were considered per sample. \n\nExtracts of all samples were prepared as previously described by Gomes et al. [42].  \n\nL929 cells relative viability (%) was determined for each extract concentration and compared to tissue \n\nculture polystyrene (TCPS). Latex extracts were used as a positive control of cellular death. All \n\ncytotoxicity tests were performed in triplicate. \n\n2.4.2. Isolation and culture of GBMSCs \n\nBone marrow stromal cells were isolated from the iliac crest of adult goats and cultured with basic \n\nculture medium - DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B. Cells were cultured until confluence \n\nand sub-cultured at P1 and P2 before seeding. The relative viability of GBMSCs on the HAp scaffolds \n\nwas also determined by carrying out an MTS assay, after each time point. For this purpose, cells-HAp \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

Culture \n\nmedium without FBS and without phenol red was mixed with MTS in a 5:1 ratio, added to the wells, until \n\ntotally cover the constructs, and incubated for 3 hours at 37\u00baC in a 5% CO2 incubator. After the \n\nincubation period, 100 \u00b5L of MTS and medium mixture were transferred into each well of a 96-well plate \n\nand absorbance was read at 490 nm. \n\n2.4.3. Seeding of GBMSCs onto the HAp porous layer and 3-D culturing (Phase IA)  \n\nGBMSCs cells were enzymatically lifted with 3 mL of trypsin after reaching 80% of confluence at P1 or \n\nP2. A cell suspension was prepared and seeded onto the HAp porous layer in a scaffold drop-wise \n\nmanner, at a cellular density of 2.1 x 105 cells.mL-1. Cells/scaffolds constructs were cultured in 48-well \n\nplates for 3 days with basic medium in static conditions. For inducing osteogenic differentiation, cell-\n\nseeded scaffolds were cultured with an osteogenic media consisting of alpha-MEM (Minimal Essential \n\nMedium Eagle alpha modification, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with osteogenic supplements \n\nnamely, 10-8 M dexamethasone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 50 ?g.mL-1 ascorbic acid (Sigma, USA) and 10 \n\nmM ?-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA). The constructs were cultured for 3 days in static cultures with \n\nbasal medium plus 14 days in osteogenic medium (17 days) and under dynamic conditions by using a \n\nlab rotator (Model DSR 2800 V, Digisystem Laboratory Instruments Inc., Taiwan). Samples were \n\ncollected on day 0 (12 hours after seeding), day 3 and day 17 for further studies. \n\n2.4.4. Seeding of GBMSCs onto the CHT porous layer and 3-D culturing (Phase IB)  \n\nTo induce chondrogenic differentiation, CHT scaffolds were seeded with 2.5 x 105 cells and cultured for \n\n7, 21 and 28 days with chondrogenic medium consisting of DMEM (Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium, \n\nSigma-Aldrich, USA) supplemented with 10 ?g.mL-1 TGF-?

The cell-scaffold constructs were also cultured under dynamic conditions by using a lab rotator \n\nsystem. Samples were retrieved after 7, 21 and 28 days of chondrogenic culture. Before chondrogenic \n\nmedium was added, samples were cultured for 3 days in basal medium in static conditions. In both \n\ncases, culture media were changed every 2-3 days. \n\n2.4.5.

For this purpose, after \n\neach culturing period, samples were removed from culture, washed in PBS, fixed in 2.5% \n\nglutaraldehyde, rinsed two times with PBS and dehydrated in series of ethanol concentrations. The \n\nsamples were then dried at room temperature and sputter coated with gold before observation under the \n\nSEM. \n\n2.4.6. Assessment of GBMSCs proliferation and differentiation \n\nGBMSCs-HAp and -CHT construct celullarity was determined using a fluorimetric dsDNA quantification \n\nkit (PicoGreen, Molecular Probes). For this purpose, samples collected on day 0, day 3 and day 17, \n\nwere washed twice with a sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Sigma, USA) solution and transferred \n\ninto 1.5 mL microtubes containing 1 mL of ultra-pure water. GBMSCs-HAp and -CHT were incubated for \n\n1 hour at 37\u00baC in a water-bath and then stored in a -80\u00baC freezer until testing. Prior to DNA \n\nquantification constructs were thawed and sonicated for 15 minutes. Samples and standards (ranging \n\nbetween 0 and 2 \u00b5g.mL-1) were prepared per each well of an opaque 96-well plate were added 28.7 \u00b5L \n\nof sample or standard plus 71.3 \u00b5L of PicoGreen solution and 100 \u00b5L of Tris-EDTA buffer. Triplicates \n\nwere made for each sample or standard. The plate was incubated for 10 minutes in the dark and \n\nfluorescence was measured on a microplate ELISA reader (BioTek, USA) using an emission of 490 nm \n\nand an absorbance wavelength of 520 nm. A standard curve was created and sample DNA values were \n\nread off from the standard graph. \n\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was measured to evaluate osteoblastic differentiation. Cell-HAp \n\nscaffold constructs used for DNA quantification assay were used to determine ALP levels. As cells were \n\nlysed during the above mentioned procedure, both DNA and other cell produced proteins were in \n\nsuspension in the supernatant solution. So, to each well of a 96-well plate were added 20 \u00b5L of sample \n\nplus 60 \u00b5L of substrate solution: 0.2% (wt/v) p-nytrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) in a substrate buffer: 1 M \n\ndiethanolamine HCl (Merck, Germany), at pH 9.8. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 45 \n\nminutes at 37\u00baC. After the incubation period, 80 \u00b5L of a stop solution: 2 M NaOH (Panreac) containing \n\n0.2 mM EDTA (Sigma, USA), was added to each well. Standards were prepared with 10 \u00b5mol.mL-1       \n\np-nytrophenol, pNP (Sigma, USA) and the stop solutions in order to achieve the final concentrations \n\nranging between 0 and 0.3 \u00b5mol.mL-1.

The \n\nprocedures immunocytochemistry were carried out following the instructions included in commercial kit: \n\nthe RTU Vector Stain kit \u2013 Universal Elite ABC kit PK7200 (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, USA). \n\nThis kit was used with a Peroxidase Substract Kit \u2013 DAB SK4100 (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, \n\nUSA). For this study, samples were incubated with collagen type I (1/100, Chemicon, USA) for 1.6 hours \n\nand the biotinylated secondary antibody was incubated for 1 hour prior to wash and incubate the \n\nconstructs with DAB for about 6 minutes. Also an osteopontin antibody (1/100, Rabitt polyclonal to \n\nosteopontin, Abcam, UK) was tested using slides from the same constructs. Although in this particular \n\ncase, a fluorescent secondary antibody was used instead of a biotinylated one and kept overnight at \n\n80\u00baC. The metacrylate sections were incubated with osteopontin antibody, washed and then Alexa Fluor \n\n488 secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, UK) was added to cell-HAp scaffold constructs. \n\nThe incubation periods used were the same for both type I collagen and osteopontin antibodies. The \n\nobservation of the constructs was performed using an Axio Imager Z1 microscope (Zeiss, Germany). \n\nGlucosaminoglycans (GAGs) quantification assay [43] was used to determine extracellular chondrogenic \n\nmatrix formation after day 7, day 21 and day 28 of chondrogenic medium culture. Cell-CHT scaffold \n\nconstructs used for this assay were the same used for ALP and DNA assays. GAGs standards were \n\nobtained by preparing a chondroitin sulphate solution ranging from 0 and 30 \u00b5g.mL-1. In each well of a \n\n96-well plate, 20 \u00b5L of sample or standard were added in triplicates and then 250 \u00b5L per well of \n\ndimethylmethylene blue (DMB, Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added and mixed. The optical density was \n\nmeasured immediately at 525 nm on a microplate ELISA reader. A standard curve was created and \n\nGAGs sample values were read off from the standard graph. \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. CHARACTERIZATION \n\nThe exploitation of a variety of biomaterials and cultured cells in tissue engineering (TE) approaches \n\noffers a wide range of possibilities for the successful repair of different skeleton damages. The ideal \n\nstrategy for the treatment of osteochondral defects requires a scaffold architecture possessing a \n\n\u2018cartilage-like\u2019 layer and a \u2018bone-like\u2019 layer (lower) [44]. With this approach, the porous bilayered structure \n\nis expected to act as a support for cells functions and ultimately, leading to the de novo formation of an \n\narticular cartilage-like tissue in the cartilage void, while providing a good fixation on the underlying bone.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Novel hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffold for osteochondral tissue engineering applications: scaffold design and its \n\nperformance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal cells \n\n \n\n \n- 204 - \n \n \n\nPreviously, it was shown [45] that it is possible to develop a 3-D macroporous HAp structures by \n\nimpregnation of PU sponges with HAp particles, followed by burning the organic template and sintering \n\nthe ceramic at 1300\u00baC. Moreover, it is well known that a wide number of highly porous scaffold systems \n\nmay be prepared by means of freezing a polymer solution and subsequently freeze-drying. In this study, \n\nwe developed a novel bilayered scaffold by means of pouring a 3 wt% chitosan solution upon the \n\nsintered HAp scaffolds followed by a freeze-drying procedure. Figure 1 shows the macroscopic \n\nappearance of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. The macro image shows two distinct layers, which \n\ncorresponds to HAp (bottom layer) and CHT (upper layer). The improved stability at the inorganic-\n\norganic interface and overall integrity of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds was achieved by partially \n\nimpregnating the porous ceramic layer with the polymeric one.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1. Macroscopic appearance of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. \n\nFigure 2 shows the FTIR spectra of the HAp and CHT layers of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. The \n\nFTIR analysis revealed the presence of the typical bands of CHT on the upper layer namely, the \n\nabsorption bands of the amide I and amide II groups at 1650 cm-1 and 1586 cm-1 (?), respectively [46,47]. \n\nOn the other hand, the IR spectrum also exhibited the peaks at 900 and 1155 cm-1 (?) associated to \n\nsaccharine structure, and aliphatic C-H stretching bands in the region of 2996-2882 cm-1 (x). The more \n\nintense and broad absorption band in the CHT is attributed to the N-H stretching and O-H stretching \n\nvibration (?) located in the spectral region of 3200-3500 cm-1.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

FTIR spectra of HAp and CHT layers of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. \n\nRegarding the FTIR spectrum of lower layer of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds, it were detected \n\nintense absorption bands at 598 and 559 cm-1 (+), and 1020 cm-1 (?), which are assigned to phosphate \n\ngroups with the frequency of vibration ?4 and ?3, respectively. The small and sharp band observed at \n\n3572 cm-1 (0) corresponds to the stretching mode of hydroxyl group, which is characteristic of calcium \n\nphosphates such as hydroxylapatite [48]. The FTIR data showed no typical peaks of the PU sponge in \n\nthe HAp layer after performing the heat treatments. This result is an important one, because it shows \n\nthat no traces of PU sponge were present in the HAp layer, thus avoiding the presence of organic \n\nmatter that somehow could be responsible for eliciting some cytotoxic effect. Therefore, this result has \n\nshown that by means of using the burning and sintering cycle herein described, it is possible to \n\ncompletely eliminate the \u2018sacrifice matrix\u2019 consisting of PU sponge. \n\nIt has been reported that at temperatures higher than 1200\u00baC, HAp became unstable and frequently \n\nloses the -OH groups, and transforms in decomposition products such ?-tricalcium phosphates (TCP) \n\n[48,49]. When the temperature exceeds 1250\u00baC, it may also occur a allotropic transformation and ?-TCP \n\nmay origin ?-TCP [48,49]. Although, in a previous work we have shown that the synthesized HAp is highly \n\nstable upon sintering at 1300\u00baC for 3 hours, i.e. no -OH group loss was detected and no phase \n\ntransformation observed [45]. Thus, understanding the sintering behaviour of hydroxylapatite allow us to \n\ncontrol the chemical composition and design a porous ceramic structure with controlled grain size, \n\nmicrostructure and mechanical properties, since sintering temperature also has a dramatic effect on \n\n4000 3500 3000 2500 2000 1500 1000 500\n\n%\n T\n\nra\nn\n\ns\nm\n\nit\nta\n\nn\nc\ne\n (\n\na\n.u\n\n.)\n\nWavenumber (cm\n-1\n)\n\nsintered HA\n\nchitosan\n\nx\n\n?\n\n+??\n\n?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\np \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

Actually, it has been shown that a decrease in porosity, i.e. increase in particle \n\nagglomeration is accompanied by an increase in the mechanical strength, due to the homogeneity and \n\nmore closed packed HAp grains [50].  \n\nIn this study, the XRD was also used to investigate the crystallinity and phase content of inorganic layer \n\nof the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. Figure 3 shows the XRD pattern of the ceramic porous layer (on \n\npowder) after burning the organic template at 900\u00baC followed by sintering at 1300\u00baC for 3 hours. The \n\nXRD data is in good attainment with the FTIR, showing that the ceramic layer consists of highly \n\ncrystalline form of hydroxyapaptite [51,52]. As expected, the pouring and freeze-drying of a chitosan \n\nsolution upon the ceramic porous layer did not affect both crystallinity and phase content of the HAp.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3. XRD pattern of the HAp scaffolds of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. \n\nFrom the SEM images shown in Figure 4, it can be seen that HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds \n\nmicroarchitecture consists of a highly porous and open pore structure. Figure 4A shows the interface of \n\nHAp/CHT bilayered scaffold at the surface, where it is possible to observe the two distinct porous layers. \n\nFigure 4B shows a typical HAp pore at the HAp/CHT interface, showing the good interpenetration of \n\nCHT into the HAp scaffolds. This observation suggests that a good bonding will exist between the two \n\nlayers, which is known to be a requisite necessary to assure a good integrity and functionality of the \n\nosteochondral construct (scaffold+cells). Moreover, the SEM examination of the HAp scaffolds revealed \n\nthat pores are highly interconnected and possess a size diameter in the range of 50-500 ?m (Figure \n\n4C).  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V. Novel hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffold for osteochondral tissue engineering applications: scaffold design and its \n\nperformance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal cells \n\n- 207 - \n \n \n\nSeveral authors [53,54] have shown that freezing conditions, concentration of polymer and freeze-drying \n\nparameters has great influence on the final microstructure and degree of interconnectivity of the \n\nscaffolds. Figure 4D shows the SEM micrograph of a CHT pore at the typical transversal cross-section \n\nof CHT layer. This study revealed that CHT pores quite resembles a typical spongy 3-D structure, with \n\nopen pores, anisotropic porosity and pore size ranging from 20-600 ?m. It is also possible to observe \n\nthe formation of microfibres during the freeze-drying process. This can be an advantage since these \n\nfibres can act as an additional anchor-framework for improved cells adhesion. Therefore, the results \n\ndepicted in figure 4 have shown that by combining a sintering and freeze-drying technique it is possible \n\nto develop HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds with an adequate pore size and pore distribution for ingrowths \n\nof cells and diffusion of nutrients, while facilitating vascularization, and thus to be used in tissue \n\nengineering purposes [55,56]. Although, it is noteworthy that SEM analysis is only a reliable technique to \n\nobtain information about the 2-D systems, i.e. investigate the macro and micro-structure of the scaffold \n\nin a non-destructive way at the surface, and shows limited performance for assessing the pore \n\ninterconnectivity of the materials.  \n\n \n\n2.00 mm\n\nA\n\n200 \u00b5m\n\nB\n\n200 \u00b5m\n\nC\n\n200 \u00b5m\n\nD\n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Therefore, in this study the 3-D architecture of the materials was investigated in a non-\n\ndestructive way, by means of using a micro-CT analysis.  \n\nFigure 5 shows the micro-computed tomography (?-CT) analysis of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds. A \n\ncustomized threshold technique was carried out and has shown to be effective on assessing the pore \n\nsize and interconnectivity of CHT (Figure 5A). From the ?-CT 2-D scans it was possible to assess that \n\npore size is higher than those obtained by the SEM (surface study). Actually, the inner pores of CHT \n\nwas assessed to be up to 2 mm in length, which may be explained by the fact that ?-CT allows to study \n\nthe inner 3-D architecture of the materials. Figure 5B shows the 2-D transversal view of the HAp \n\nscaffolds, which corroborated the SEM findings. These results clearly showed that the HAp pore \n\nnetwork is highly interconnected. From figure 5C it became possible to observe that CHT perfectly \n\ninterpenetrated into the HAp, thus showing the good continuity of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffold. This \n\nresult is encouraging since a strong mechanical interface between the HAp and CHT is required for the \n\ngood performance of the construct.  \n\nPrevious reported results have shown that the mean porosity of the HAp scaffolds (bottom layer) of the \n\nHAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds consisted of 67.8 \u00b1 5.1% [45]. In this study, the percentage of porosity of \n\nthe HAp and CHT layers were also determined (Figure 5D). The results have shown that HAp possess a \n\nporosity of 59.3 \u00b1 1.7%, which is in good agreement with the previous reported data, and that CHT layer \n\nconsisted of 74.6 \u00b1 1.2%. Therefore, the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds have shown to possess \n\nadequate porosity [56] towards being used in tissue engineering scaffolding. Despite, the percentage of \n\nporosity at the interface was not possible to determine due to the limitation of the technique, i.e. since \n\nthe coefficient of attenuation of HAp is much higher that that of CHT, the threshold applied for \n\ndetermining the porosity of HAp layer (T300) is different from that for assessing the porosity of CHT \n\nlayer (T55). In fact, the observation of the dramatic lowering of porosity of CHT layer at the interface \n\nconsists of an artefact and is a consequence of the interference of HAp layer. This data also shows that \n\nthe overall integrity of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds was achieved by partially impregnating the \n\nporous ceramic layer with the polymeric one, and is restricted to an area of 750 ?m in length. Moreover, \n\nthe results have shown that a physical interaction is the responsible for the stability of the bilayered \n\nscaffolds at the interface between hydroxylapatite and chitosan. Therefore, another biopolymer that can \n\nbe processed by freeze-drying may serve the same role as the chitosan, i.e. top layer of the bilayered \n\nscaffold. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

Novel hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffold for osteochondral tissue engineering applications: scaffold design and its \n\nperformance when seeded with goat bone marrow stromal cells \n\n \n\n \n- 210 - \n \n \n\nTo examine the mechanical properties of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds, compression tests of the two \n\nlayers were conducted separately, in dry conditions. The modulus (E) for the HAp and CHT in \n\ncompression was found to be 153 \u00b1 12 MPa and 2.9 \u00b1 0.4 MPa, respectively. This results show that \n\nHAp scaffold possess quite good mechanical properties for being used in bone tissue engineering. On \n\nthe other hand, the value for CHT scaffolds are in good attainment with those for normal human articular \n\ncartilage, which as been shown to have a compressive modulus ranging from 1.9 to 14.4 MPa [57,58]. \n\nThus, the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds demonstrated quite promising mechanical properties for being \n\nused in TE of osteochondral defects. Actually, it has been shown that the biomechanical properties of \n\narticular cartilage greatly depends on composition, density of its ECM and interstitial fluid flow (water \n\nand solutes) [59]. Therefore, in wet conditions is expected a reduction of the mechanical properties. \n\nHowever, it must be noted that after implantation of the construct we expect to occur a matrix deposition \n\nand accumulation mediated by the cells, i.e. chondrocytes in the case of cartilage, and by this mean \n\nimprove the mechanical function of the engineered cartilage [60].  \n\nThe capability of a scaffold to uptake and preserve the water within the structure is an important feature \n\nfor developing suitable tissue engineering constructs for regeneration of both cartilage and \n\nosteochondral defects, since cartilage possesses a high content of water where oxygen and nutrients \n\nare dissolved. The water-uptake and weight loss of the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds was investigated \n\nafter soaking in PBS solution at physiological pH, for 1 up to 30 days (Figure 6). From figure 6A it can \n\nbe seen that the water uptake profile of the HAp/CHT scaffolds reach a maximum of swelling of \n\napproximately 65% (w/w), after 5 days. From day 5 until day 30 the water uptake capability of the \n\nHAp/CHT remained constant (Figure 6A). After immersion of HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds in PBS, no \n\nsignificant changes on the weight loss were observed. In fact, the weight loss profile showed that from \n\nday 3 until day 30, the HAp/CHT scaffolds showed a reduction in weight of approximately 0.8% (Figure \n\n6B). It has been demonstrated that HAp dissolves slowly, both in vitro and in vivo [61,62]. Therefore, this \n\ngradual weight loss should be mainly due to the slow loss of the highly hydrophilic CHT scaffold by a \n\nsolution-mediated dissolution, i.e. leaching of the water solubles rather than HAp scaffold. A decrease in \n\nCHT molecular weight lowers the water-uptake and favours dissolution [63]. Thus, the overall \n\nperformance of the HAp/CHT scaffolds may be easily tailored by using different formulations namely, \n\nvarying the CHT molecular weight and cross-linking [41]. Nevertheless, these results are quite interesting \n\nsince the HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds have shown to have enough stability, and preserve their size \n\nand physical integrity. This evidences their good performance for applications in TE of osteochondral \n\ndefects and subsequent implantation. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

From results it is possible to assess that \n\ncells are viable in the presence of the HAp and HAp/CHT scaffold leachables. In fact, the viability levels \n\nare statistically similar among different HAp and HAp/CHT concentrations, reaching the maximum \n\nviability of ~100%. This shows that both HAp scaffolds and HAp/CHT scaffolds do not exert any \n\ncytotoxic effect on L929 cells.

IN VITRO ASSESSMENT OF GBMSCS ADHESION, PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION \n\nThe current investigations using biodegradable implants seeded mesenchymal stem cells have shown \n\nto be effective on the repair of osteochondral defects, in vivo [19]. In this work, we first analysed the \n\nability of the HAp porous layer to successfully support the GBMSCs adhesion and functions, in vitro \n\n(Phase IA). As mentioned above, when treating a osteochondral defects this \u2018bone-like\u2019 layer is aimed at \n\nprovide the repair of the subchondral bone [64], while providing a good fixation on the underlying bone, \n\nduring cartilage regeneration. Figure 8 shows the SEM micrographs obtained from samples resulting \n\nfrom culturing GBMSCs onto the HAp porous layer in osteogenic medium, for 14 days. It is possible to \n\nobserve the high cellular density on the surface of the HAp porous layer, which indicates that cells \n\nadhered and grew favourably (Figure 8A). Additionally, it is also possible to observe that cells did not \n\nobstruct the pores of the scaffold at the surface (Figure 8B), and perfectly adhere, spread actively and \n\npresented a flatten morphology onto the surface of the biomaterial (Figure 8C). In fact, the transversal \n\nsection analysis indicate that cells were able to penetrate deeper into the scaffold core (Figure 8D).

Analysis of DNA values showed a significant enhancement comparatively to initial time points \n\n(Figure 9).  \n\nThe cell number increased, and hence a high cellular proliferation occurred in the presence of \n\nosteogenic media. The DNA biochemical analysis was corroborated by MTS assay (Figure 10) showing \n\nthat cells not only proliferated well in HAp porous layer but also were viable. These results illustrate that \n\nHAp porous layer is a suitable 3-D support for cellular proliferation.  \n\nThe functional activity of the GBMSCs on the HAp porous layer was determined by quantifying the ALP \n\nactivity (Figure 11). From day 0 to day 3, cells were not cultured with osteogenic medium so, ALP levels \n\nrefer only to basal levels of alkaline phosphatase activity in GBMSCs.

Immunolabeling for collagen type I was \n\nalso detected, thus showing the production of collagenous matrix (Figure 12C). Therefore, this data \n\nconfirm that GBMSCs were able to differentiate in the HAp layer after culturing in the osteogenic media \n\nfor 14 days. \n\nGBMSCs seeded onto chitosan layer present a good viability and proliferation (data not showed). SEM \n\nmicrographs show the attachment of cells possessing size and shape consistent with those of \n\nchondrocytes throughout the scaffolds, i.e. round chondrocyte-like cells (Figure 13). It is also possible to \n\nobserve a good distribution of cells and maintenance of the rounded cell morphology after day 28 \n\n(Figure 13A). At higher magnification it can also be seen the moderate cell adhesion to the substrate \n\n(Figure 13B), which is generally indicative of a cell performing its differentiation function [66].

The novel 3-D \n\nmacroporous hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffolds exhibit physicochemical properties that \n\nappear to make them a suitable candidate to be used as a supportive structure for cells functions. \n\nMoreover, the in vitro cell culture studies demonstrated that both HAp and CHT layers provide an \n\nadequate 3-D support for the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of GBMSCs into osteoblasts \n\nand chondrocytes, respectively. The HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds are advantageous by several reasons \n\nnamely, they can be designed with several sizes and controlled architecture to fit patient specific injuries \n\nand cell functions, respectively. The HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds showed promising biological \n\nbehaviour and may therefore find applications in tissue engineering of bone and osteochondral defects.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.

INTRODUCTION \n\nDendrimers are a relatively new class of synthetic [1,2], highly branched, nanospherical and low \n\ndispersive macromolecules [3,4]. They can be designed to provide a quite versatile choice of external \n\nfunctional groups in order to reduce cytotoxicity and enhance transepithelial transport [5,6], for interaction \n\nwith coupling molecules such as natural-based polymers [7] and fluorescent probes [8] and an inner \n\nhydrophobic core where other molecules can be trapped [6]. Among myriad possibilities, dendrimers can \n\nfind applications as a delivery carrier of drugs [6,9] and DNA (transfection) [10], imaging agents [11,12], and \n\ntissue engineering scaffolding [13]. Although there are different routes to synthesise dendrimers [4], their \n\nmaximum size is typically in the order of ~10-20 nm [12,14]. Moreover, it has also been found [15] that high \n\ngeneration dendrimers (G7) with amine capping-groups causes haemolysis and changes in red cell \n\nmorphology, and in general are overall cytotoxic. Therefore, the strategy proposed herein envisions the \n\nsurface engineering of a dendrimer core grafted to natural-based and biocompatible polymers (linear \n\npolymer chains) in order to obtain copolymers of new architectures with tuned nanoparticle size and \n\nmore versatile macromolecules. These should make it possible to avoid the cytotoxic effects of high-\n\ngeneration dendrimers. This new class of materials is expected to exhibit entirely new properties since \n\nthe structures might have sizes larger than 10 nm and different surface properties (dendronized \n\npolymer) [1]. It is expected that the dendronized polymers developed in the present work will have \n\npotential applications as novel drug or gene delivery carriers for targeting certain tissues or cell cultures. \n\nSuch nano-devices could display a higher loading capacity, and allow the bulk incorporation of bioactive \n\nmolecules of higher molecular weights and of different chemistry, while maintaining high internalization \n\nand transfection efficiency as compared to conventional dendrimers.  \n\nIn this study, novel water-soluble nanoparticles consisting of a poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer \n\ncore with grafted carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) chains (dendronized polymer) were successfully \n\nsynthesized. They were then characterized and screened for cytotoxicity using a fibroblast-cell line \n\n(L929) and rat bone marrow stromal Cells (RBMSCs) by means of performing a tetrazolium reduction \n\n(MTT) assay and luminescent cell viability assay based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) \n\nquantification, respectively. The internalization of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was also investigated using both osteoblastic-cell line     \n\n(SaOs-2) and RBMSCs as target cells. These types of cells are widely used in tissue engineering \n\napproaches [16,17] and are simple in vitro systems for assessing the internalization efficiency of \n\nfluorescent-labeled  molecules. It is our particular interest to engineer these nanoparticles to find \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n\n \n \n- 228 - \n \n \n\napplications in the intracellular controlled delivery of biological agents, including differentiation factors or \n\ngenetic material, to modulate stem cell behaviour while avoiding undesired secondary effects. In this \n\ncontext, it was also investigated the capacity of dexamethasone-loaded CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles \n\nto promote the osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells. Alizarin red and ALP \n\nstainings were carried out to assess qualitatively the mineralization capacity and ALP activity, which are \n\nknown to denote the osteogenic differentiation. The quantitative content of ALP and osteocalcin, the \n\nearly and late markers of osteogenic differentiation respectively, were also determined. \n\n2. EXPERIMENTAL  \n\n2.1. SYNTHESIS OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM NANOPARTICLES \n\nCarboxymethylchitosan with a degree of deacetylation of 80% and degree of substitution of 47% was \n\nsynthesized by a chemical modification route of chitin (Sigma, Germany) as described by Chen et al. [18]. \n\nStarburst\u00ae poly(amidoamine)-carboxylic terminated dendrimers, PAMAM-CT (generation 1.5, 20% (w/v) \n\nmethanolic solution) with an ethylenediamine core were purchased from Aldrich. \n\nCarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were \n\nprepared in a stepwise manner as follows: (i) increasing the generation of the PAMAM-CT (G 1.5), (ii) \n\nobtaining a PAMAM-methyl ester terminated dendrimer, (iii) reaction of PAMAM and CMCht, i.e. the \n\nreaction goes through a condensation reaction between the methyl ester and amine groups [19], and (iv) \n\nmodifying the methyl ester groups that do not react to carboxylic ones in the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer, \n\nfollowed by precipitation. Firstly, the increase of the dendrimers\u2019 generation was carried out as follows: \n\nan appropriate volume of PAMAM-CT (G 1.5) in methanol was transferred to a 2 mL volumetric flask \n\nand the solvent evaporated off under nitrogen gas, and the traces dried under vacuum in order to \n\ncompletely remove the methanol. The starting compound was re-dissolved in ultra-pure water to give a \n\nfinal concentration of 10 mg.mL-1 and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 with dilute hydrochloric acid solution, \n\nHCl (Riedel de-Haen, Germany) solution. Then, 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide \n\nhydrochloride, EDC (Fluka, Slovakia) was added to the solution at a molar ratio sufficient to modify the \n\ncarboxylate residue of the dendrimers and kept under agitation for 30 min at room temperature. \n\nEthylenediamine, EDA (Sigma, Germany) was added to the solution at a molar ratio equal to that of \n\nEDC and let react for at least 4 hrs. After this period the exceeding EDC was removed by dialysis \n\n(cellulose tubing, benzoylated for separating compounds with a molecular weight of ? 1,200 from \n\ncompounds with a molecular weight > 2,000, Sigma, Germany). The compound was used without \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n \n\n- 229 - \n \n \n\npurification in the next step. After preparing the PAMAM-amine terminated compound, PAMAM-AT, an \n\nexhaustive alkylation of primary amines (Michael addition) was carried [20]. An appropriate volume of \n\nPAMAM-AT (~8.4 mmol) was transferred to a 50 mL flask and 30 mL of methanol (Sigma, Germany), \n\nand 1.14 mL of methyl methacrylate (~12.6 mmol) (Fluka, Germany) were added. The solution was kept \n\nunder agitation in a water bath for 24 hrs at 50\u00baC, to obtain the compound (PAMAM-methyl ester). The \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan (100 mg) dissolved in ultrapure water (10 mL) was mixed with the latter obtained \n\nPAMAM-methyl ester dendrimer (50 mg), which was previously dissolved in a 20/80 water/methanol \n\n(v/v) solution. The final solution was diluted by adding 30 mL of methanol and kept under agitation for 72 \n\nhrs. After this period, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer with carboxylic-terminated groups were obtained as \n\ndescribed elsewhere [19]. CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were then precipitated after addition \n\nof an appropriate volume of a saturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 (Aldrich, Germany) solution and \n\nacetone (Pronalab, Portugal). On the other hand CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were mixed \n\nwith a dexamethasone solution with a final concentration of 5 x 10-4 M under agitation (w/w). The \n\nmixture was then added to the precipitation media consisting of a saturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 \n\n(Aldrich, Germany) and acetone solution, under vigorous agitation. Precipitates were collected by \n\nfiltration and dispersed in ultrapure water for dialysis during the period of 48 hrs. Both CMCht/PAMAM \n\nand dexamethasone-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were obtained by freezing the \n\nsolution at -80\u00baC and freeze-drying (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain) up to 4 d to complete remove the \n\nsolvent. It is noteworthy that the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are water-soluble at \n\nphysiological pH. \n\n2.2. LABELING OF CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES WITH FITC  \n\nA 10 mg.mL-1 fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC (Sigma, Germany) solution was prepared in dimethyl \n\nsulfoxide, DMSO anhydrous (Riedel de-Haen) (dark conditions). Conjugates of CMCht/PAMAM-FITC \n\nwere prepared by covalently bonding the amine group of carboxymethylchitosan and the isothyocianate \n\ngroup of FITC (thiourea bond). Firstly, a 10 mg.mL-1 CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles solution \n\nwas prepared in a carbonate-bicarbonate coupling buffer of pH 9.2. Then, 50 ?L of the FITC/DMSO \n\nsolution was added per each mL of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles buffered solution under \n\nagitation, and kept in dark at 4\u00baC for 8 hrs. The FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nsolution was dialyzed against ultra-pure water in order to remove unlinked FITC for 24 hrs and filtered \n\n(pore size &lt;220 nm) in sterile and dark conditions. The final product was obtained as an orange powder \n\nafter freeze-drying. The labelling efficiency was investigated by Fourier-transform infra-red, FTIR \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES \n\nFourier transform infra-red (FTIR) analyses were performed by means of preparing transparent \n\npotassium bromide pellets containing the samples and using a Perkin-Elmer spectroscope (Perkin-\n\nElmer 1600 series equipment, UK).  \n\nThe morphology of the nanoparticles was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The \n\nlyophilized CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dispersed in ultrapure water to obtain a \n\nsolution with final concentration of 1 mg.mL-1, and then 20 ?L was placed over a 9.9 mm mica disc \n\n(Agar Scientific, England) and blown dried with nitrogen gas for subsequent characterization. The \n\nsamples were analysed using the Tapping Mode\u2122 with a MultiMode AFM connected to a NanoScope III \n\ncontroller, both from Veeco, USA, with non-contact silicon nanoprobes (ca 300 kHz) from Nanosensors, \n\nSwitzerland. All images were plane-fitted using the third degree-flatten procedure included in the \n\nNanoScope software version 4.43r8. The particle size distribution was determined with the same \n\nsoftware. The morphology and size of the particles was further analysed by transmission electron \n\nmicroscopy, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The Netherlands, equipped with a MEGA VIEW-II \n\nDOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT DOCU). The nanoparticles were stained with 2% \n\nof phosphotungstic acid and placed on copper grids for further observation. The size of the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was also measured in a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano \n\nZS, Malvern Instruments, UK). \n\n2.4. IN VITRO CYTOTOXICITY SCREENING OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES \n\nA luminescent cell viability assay based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was \n\nperformed by exposing Rat Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (RBMSCs) to CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles. Prior to the cell culture studies CMCht, PAMAM-CT G 1.5, and CMCht/PAMAM \n\nnanoparticles were sterilized under an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere. RBMSCs were isolated from \n\nfemora of 7 week-old male Fischer 344/N rats (SLC Inc. Japan), and expanded in T75 cm2 culture flasks \n\nin the presence of Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (MEM, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) with 15% fetal \n\nbovine serum, FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1 % antibiotic-antimycotic (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) \n\nsolution. The animals were sacrificed by administrating an excess of anesthesia, in accordance to the \n\nEthics Committee at the Tissue Engineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). After reaching \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n \n\n- 231 - \n \n \n\nconfluency, the cells (passage 1, P1) were released from substratum and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 \n\nmin. The supernatant was aspirated and cells re-suspended with 10 mL of complete culture medium. \n\nCell concentration was determined using an automatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, \n\nJapan). Viability of the RBMSCs was also analyzed with a NucleoCounter (Chemometec, Denmark), \n\nusing prior seeding as described elsewhere [21]. RBMSCs were seeded (sub-cultured) to each well of a \n\n96-well TCPS plate at a cell density of 5 x 103 cells.mL-1. A solution of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles at a concentration of 10 mg.mL-1 was prepared in a complete culture medium. Serial \n\ndilutions (1, 0.1, 0.01 mg.mL-1) were further prepared using the complete culture medium. Possible \n\nchanges in the osmolality of the culture media were investigated using an automatic cryoscopic \n\nosmometer (OSMOMAT O 30-D, Gonotec, Germany). After a period of 24 hrs, the culture medium was \n\nchanged by the respective serial dilutions and the cells cultured under standard culture conditions for 1 \n\nand 3 d. A latex rubber extract was used as the positive control for cellular death. Finally, the ATP \n\ncontent was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay, \n\nfollowing the protocol provided by the supplier (Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was \n\nmeasured using opaque-walled multi-well plate in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-\n\nElmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA). Results were analyzed for statistical significance using \n\nStudent\u2019s t-test with the JMP 5.0.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). \n\n2.5. INVESTIGATION OF THE INTERNALIZATION EFFICIENCY USING SAOS-2 CELLS AND RBMSCS UNDER \n\nFLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY AND FACS ANALYSIS \n\nHuman osteoblast-like cells (SaOs-2 cells, ECACC, UK) were maintained in T75 cm2 culture flasks, \n\ncultured with basic culture medium - DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% A/B, and passaged \n\nafter reaching confluence. A cell suspension was prepared and seeded on TCPS coverslips (Sarstedt \n\nInc., USA) in 24-well plates (1 x 104 cells.well-1) and cultured in standard culture conditions for 24 hrs. \n\nThe internalization of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by SaOs-2 cells was assessed after 3, \n\n12, 24 hrs, and 14 d. After each time point cells on the TCPS coverslips were fixed with 4% formalin \n\n(Sigma, Germany) and the nuclei stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dilactate, DAPI blue (100 \n\nng.mL-1; Molecular Probes), for assessing possible cell morphological changes. Fluorescence was \n\nprotected by using an antifade agent (ProLong\u00ae Antifade Kit, Invitrogen, USA), following the supplier \n\nprocedure and cells were observed under the fluorescence microscope (AxioImager Z1, Zeiss Inc., \n\nGermany). \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n\n \n \n- 232 - \n \n \n\nRBMSCs were isolated from rats and expanded until reaching 80% of confluency. The RBMSCs (P1) \n\nwere trypsinized and transferred to a 6-well (1 x 105 cells.well-1) and a TCPS coverslips in 24-well TCPS \n\nplates (2 x 104 cells.well-1) for analysis under FACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. For \n\nfluorescence microscopy, RBMSCs were cultured in a MEM complete culture medium containing the 0.1 \n\nmg.mL-1 FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles for a period of 12 hrs until 14 d. For \n\nFACS analysis RBMSCs were cultured in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. The samples for fluorescence \n\nmicroscopy were prepared as follows: each well was washed with 1 mL of PBS, and cells fixed with 4% \n\nformalin (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) for 10 min at 4\u00baC followed by washing each well twice with PBS. After \n\nthat cells were incubated with 0.5 mL of PBS containing Texas Red?-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes, \n\nInvitrogen, USA) and Hoechst 33258 (Invitrogen, USA) for staining the actin filaments of the \n\ncytoskeleton and nuclei of cells, respectively. The protocols provided by the supplier were followed with \n\nfew modifications. The permeabilization of cells with Triton? X-100 was not carried out to avoid any \n\nundesired effect over the integrity of cells nuclei. TCPS coverslips were washed once with PBS and \n\nfluorescence protected using the ProLong\u00ae antifade kit. The specimens were observed under a \n\nfluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, Olympus Co. Ltd., Japan). FACS analysis was carried out as \n\nfollows: each well of the 6-well plate was washed with 2 mL of PBS. Then, PBS was aspirated and cells \n\nreleased from substratum as described above. Afterwards, it was added to each well 3.5 mL of MEM \n\ncomplete medium and samples transferred to a 15 mL Falcon. After centrifugation at 900 rpm for 5 min, \n\ncells were re-suspended in 0.5 mL of complete culture medium and passed through cell strainers [22]. \n\nAfterwards, 1 ?L propidium iodide (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) was added to each sample for determining \n\nthe number of live cells. After this step, cells were loaded in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD \n\nBiosciences Imunocytometry Systems, USA) and analyzed with a minimum of 10,000 events counting. \n\nCalibrite beads three-color kit (BD CaliBRITETM beads, USA) was used to adjust the equipment \n\ninstrument settings before samples are run on the flow cytometer. Finally, the fluorescence-activated \n\ncell sorting (FACS) data was treated using the FLOWJO software. \n\n2.6. INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF COLCHICINE AND APYRASE ON THE INTERNALIZATION EFFICIENCY OF \n\nFITC-LABELED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES BY RBMSCS \n\nA cell suspension of RBMSCs (P1) in MEM complete culture medium was transferred to a 6-well           \n\n(1 x 105 cells.well-1) and TCPS coverslips in 24-well TCPS plates (2 x 104 cells.well-1) for analysis under \n\nFACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Stock solutions of 10 U.mL-1 apyrase (Nacalai \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n \n\n- 233 - \n \n \n\nTesque, Japan) and 10 \u00b5M colchicine (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) were prepared in a phosphate-buffered \n\nsaline solution. Cells were incubated in standard culture conditions and after 24 hrs, the culture medium \n\nwas replaced by a different complete culture medium containing the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles (0.01 mg.mL-1 and 0.1 mg.mL-1), and in the presence of 1 \u00b5M colchicine and \n\n0.1 U.mL-1 apyrase or both, for a period of 12 hrs to 14 d. Controls for internalization were performed by \n\nculturing RBMSCs in complete culture medium and in the presence of both colchicine and apyrase. All \n\nexperiments were carried out in triplicate. After each time period, specimens were prepared as \n\ndescribed previously. The tendency of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to be \n\ninternalized by RBMSCs was investigated by means of FACS analysis.  \n\n2.7. INVESTIGATION OF THE DEXAMETHASONE RELEASE FROM CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES \n\nThe amounts of Dex from nanoparticles were measured using an HPLC (ASI-Knauer, Germany) with an \n\nUV detector set at 246 nm. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile:acetate buffer (2 mM, pH 4.8-\n\nadjusted with glacial acetic acid) (50:50 v/v) at flow-rate of 1 mL.min-1. In brief, Dex release was studied \n\nafter dissolution of 10 mg of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in 10 mL of \n\nphosphate buffer saline, PBS (pH 7.4, Sigma, USA) solution in the absence or presence of 15% FBS. \n\nSodium azide 0.01% (wt/v, Merck, Germany) was added to the buffer. The in vitro release studies were \n\nperformed at 37?C and 60 rpm for times ranging from 1 h until 7 d. At set time intervals, 1 mL of sample \n\nwas taken for analysis and the same volume replaced by the respective buffer solution. Prior analysis, \n\nsamples were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. Samples were analyzed by means of preparing a \n\nsolution with 1:1 (sample:acetonitrile:acetate buffer, 50:25:25 v/v). A Eurospher 100 C-18 analytical \n\ncolumn (ASI-Knauer, Germany) was used. The retention time of Dex was 4 min. A calibration curve was \n\nobtained following the method described by Sun et al. [23]. Results were expressed as an average \u00b1 \n\nstandard deviation, n=6. \n\n2.8. EVALUATION OF OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION OF THE RBMSCS CULTURED IN THE PRESENCE OF \n\nCMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES LOADED WITH DEXAMETHASONE, IN VITRO \n\nRBMSCs were isolated from F344/N rats and expanded as described above. RBMSCs (P1) were \n\ncultured in a TCPS 24-well plate at a cell density of 2 x 104 cells.well-1, and cultured in a complete MEM \n\nmedium for 24 hrs. After that time, culture medium was replaced by the different culture media, and \n\nRBMSCs cultured for times up to 14 d. The effect of the concentration of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles loaded with dexamethasone on the RBMSCs osteogenic differentiation was investigated. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n\n \n \n- 234 - \n \n \n\nDexamethasone-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dissolved in MEM medium \n\nsupplemented with 0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) and 10 mM                          \n\n?-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA) at a final concentration of 0.01 and 1 mg.mL-1. RBMSCS were also \n\ncultured in a complete MEM medium, complete MEM medium containing 1 mg.mL-1 of CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles, and complete MEM medium containing 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (negative \n\ncontrols). Complete MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M dexamethasone, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid \n\nand 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate was used as the positive control for osteogenic differentiation. Culture \n\nmedia were changed every 2-3 d. All experiments were carried out 3 times using a minimum of 4 \n\nreplicates per experimental condition.  \n\nAlizarin red S staining was performed to investigate possible calcium deposition after 14 d of culturing. \n\nRBMSCs were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 95% ethanol for 15 min. The fixed cells were then \n\nwashed once with PBS and stained with 5 mg.mL-1 Alizarin red S in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. \n\nThen, it followed a washing step with ultra-pure water and mounting with Crystal/MountTM \n\n(BiomedaCorporation, USA) for observation under the phase contrast microscope (Olympus CK40, \n\nOlympus Co. Ltd., Japan). \n\nFor the ALP staining the cells were washed twice the wells with PBS, after each culture period. Cells \n\nwere fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) for 15 min at 4\u00baC and then washed twice \n\nwith AMP buffer (56 mM of 2-amino-2methyl-1,3-propanediol in ultrapure water, pH 9.9). It followed the \n\nsoaking step with staining solution 0.5 mg naphtol AS-MX phosphate and 0.5 mg fast red violet LB salt \n\nper mL, in AMP buffer. Cells were incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, washed with PBS and \n\nmounted (BiomedaCorporation, USA) for observation under the phase contrast microscope. \n\nDNA quantification was performed using Hoechst 33258 (Nacalai Tesque, Japan), as previously \n\ndescribed elsewhere [24].  \n\nAlkaline phosphatase was measured to evaluate osteoblast differentiation. The samples used for DNA \n\nquantification assay were used to determine ALP levels. Prior to analysis the samples were centrifuged \n\nat 10,000 rpm for 1 min at 4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and \n\np-nytrophenyl phosphate substrate (ZYMED\u00ae Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA). The plate was then \n\nincubated in the dark for 30 min at 37\u00baC. After the incubation period, the reaction was stopped with 1 M \n\nNaOH (Panreac). Standards were prepared with p-nytrophenol, pNP. Triplicates were made for each \n\nsample and standard. Absorbance was read at 405 nm (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and \n\nAnalytical Sciences, USA), and sample concentrations were read off from the standard graph. Enzyme \n\nactivity was expressed either as nmol of pNP released/well/30 min and normalized by DNA content. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n \n\n- 235 - \n \n \n\nThe samples used for ALP activity were treated with a 20% formic acid solution immediately after \n\nconcluding the assay and stored at 4?C for 2-3 d. Then, samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 \n\nmin at 4?C and the supernatant passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE healthcare, Sweden) \n\nfor desalting. The filtered samples were concentrated in a SPD SpeedVac\u00ae equipment attached to a UV \n\nVacuum System (Thermo Electron Corporation, USA), prior to osteocalcin quantification. Finally, the \n\nosteocalcin content was determined by performing an Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and using \n\na Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., USA). The experimental procedure \n\nwas carried out following the instructions provided by the supplier. A 100 ng.mL-1 standard solution of \n\nhuman osteocalcin was used to construct the standard curve. Data was read off from the standard \n\ngraph and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per ?g of DNA. \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n3.1. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES \n\nFigure 1 shows FTIR spectra of the PAMAM-CT dendrimers, CMCht and CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles. The results suggest that CMCht was successfully synthesized, as evidenced by the \n\npresence of characteristic absorption bands of the carboxyl group (?) at 1593 cm-1 and (?) 1420 cm-1 \n\n(?as COO- and ?s COO-). The characterization of molecular levels conjugate obtained by coupling \n\nreaction of CMCht with PAMAM dendrimer was investigated by FTIR analysis. We were able to detect \n\ncharacteristic absorption bands of groups attributed to both CMCht and PAMAM dendrimer structure in \n\nthe CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. There is an increase in intensity of the bands at 1570 and \n\n1200 cm-1 (?) attributed to the Amide II and C-N stretching vibrations, which is evidence that substituted \n\namines are present and there is possible chemical bonding between the CMCht and PAMAM. The \n\neffective degree of conjugation, measured by 1H and 13C NMR will be reported in a future work.  \n\nSome studies have been shown that PAMAM are hydrolytically degradable due to their amide \n\nskeletons, and hydrolysis occurs slowly at physiological temperatures [25]. On the other hand, chitosan \n\nand its derivatives have been shown to possess bonds that are enzyme substrates [26]. Thus, the \n\nsurface engineering of dendrimers as proposed herein may enable obtain macromolecules with a \n\ndifferent hydrolytic degradability, releasing also nontoxic products. As a consequence, the nanoparticles \n\nmay show entirely new drug delivery profiles and elimination rates. In preliminary degradation studies, a \n\ndecrease was observed in the intensity of the band at 1655-1630 cm-1 (*), which corresponds to amide I \n\n(n C=O) of the PAMAM dendrimer (see supporting information).

These preliminary data support the idea that the CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles are hydrolytically degradable at physiological temperature and pH, due to \n\ndissociation of their amide and glycosidic linkages. It has been shown that the architecture of \n\nnanoparticles strongly dictates the mechanisms and kinetics by which they are internalized by             \n\ncells [27-28]. \n\nFigure 1.

Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n \n\n- 237 - \n \n \n\nGao et al. [27] have recently demonstrated that the optimal cellular uptake of particles by endocytosis \n\noccurs with particles having diameters of ~50 nm. On the other hand, the mechanism of internalization \n\nof particles with larger diameters occurs preferentially by phagocytosis [27]. An AFM image of the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles is shown in Figure 2A. AFM characterization clearly demonstrated that \n\nthe synthesized macromolecules consistently exhibit nanosphere-like shapes. It was also found that the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles could be uniformly dispersed on a substrate by spreading a \n\nsolution of dendronized polymers on a freshly cleaved mica surface and drying under a nitrogen gas \n\nstream. The results of a morphometric analysis by AFM indicated that the nanoparticles have an \n\naverage diameter of 26 nm (dry state) and average total area of ~2123 nm2. These data were \n\ncorroborated by TEM observations. In Figures 2B-C it is possible to visualize the CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles in a greater detail. Additionally, it is also observed that the nanoparticles can \n\nform aggregates (Figure 2D).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n\n \n \n- 238 - \n \n \n\n \n \nCarboxymethylchitosan with a degree of deacetylation (DA) of 80% and degree of substitution of 47% \n\nwas used in the synthesis of the CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles. Chitosan with high degree of acetylation \n\nis insoluble in water because the acetylated units can be involved in intramolecular hydrogen linkages, \n\nwhich in part explain the insolubility of chitosan in water [22]. Nevertheless, the modifications of amino \n\ngroups with carboxylic-ones allowed us to obtain CMCht, a water soluble chitosan derivate. Using \n\npotentiometric titration it was possible to verify that the precipitation of CMCht occurred preferentially in \n\na pH range from ~2-6 (data not shown). Thus, CMCht possesses protonated amino groups at pH 2, and \n\nnegative COO- ions at physiological pH. In other words, at physiological pH the CMCht behaves as a \n\nweak polyanionic polyelectrolyte, i.e. the amino groups are not protonated and most of carboxyl groups \n\nare not dissociated. Interactions between non-covalent free carboxyl groups of CMCht and/or     \n\nPAMAM-CT dendrimer and amino groups of other CMCht particles are possible to occur, which may \n\nexplain the formation of nanoparticle aggregates. It is noteworthy that Zhu et al. [30] proposed the use of \n\nCMCht aggregates for the effective loading and controlled release of drugs. On the other hand, during \n\nthe synthesis of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimers nanoparticles there are several binding points available, \n\nonto which possible cross-linking reactions may occur. This may also explain the formation of \n\nnanoparticle aggregations. Nanoparticles aggregation might be prevented or minimized by optimizing \n\nthe concentrations of both CMCht and PAMAM. \n\nFigure 3 shows the data obtained from the particle size distribution analysis of the different \n\nnanoparticles in solution. Figure 3A shows the low dispersivity of the PAMAM-CT (G 1.5) dendrimers \n\nused in the synthesis of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. These nanoparticles have a diameter \n\nof 2 ? 1 nm, which is in agreement with previously reported data [31]. After the synthesis of the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, three kinds of particulate structures could be detected with \n\nsizes of approximately 6 ? 2 nm, 45 ? 15 nm and 250 ? 100 nm (Figure 3B). The first peak has an \n\nintensity of 5.5% and should correspond to the modified dendrimer. The second (36.2%) corresponds to \n\nthe isolated CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, and the third (58.2%) to the aggregated \n\nnanoparticles. Mammalian cells are sensitive to the osmolality of the ambient medium, and variations on \n\nthis property may affect cell morphology and cell growth.  It is known that most cell culture mediums are \n\nproduced to have a osmolality in the range of 270-330 mOsm.kg-1, since these values are acceptable \n\nfor most cells [32]. In this study, MEM medium supplemented with FBS and A/B (standard) with an \n\nosmolality of 310 \u00b1 2 mOsm.kg-1 was used. The effect of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\non the osmolality of culture media was also investigated, since the addition of medium concentrates \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

It was \n\nobserved that varying the concentration of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not \n\nsignificantly change the osmolality of media, which indicates that the cells are not cultured under \n\nosmotic stress.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.

CYTOTOXICITY SCREENING \n\nThe cell viability in this work was preliminarily screened by performing a MTT test, which is a quite \n\nreliable method for assessing cytotoxicity [33,34]. A L929 fibroblast cell line was exposed to different \n\nconcentrations of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles over a period of 24 hrs (see supporting \n\ninformation). Two polymers, water-soluble carboxymethylchitosan (linear polymer) and PAMAM-CT       \n\nG1.5 (spherical polymer), were selected for a comparative study considering the fact that \n\nbiocompatibility is thought to be influenced by various characteristics including the polymer molecular \n\nweight, concentration, structure (linear, branched, cross-linked), surface charge density and                \n\nflexibility [33,35-37]. Results indicate that dendronized polymers at concentrations of 0.01 mg.mL-1, and    \n\n0.1 mg.mL-1 do not induce any toxicity for the investigated culturing times. However, for a concentration \n\nof 1 mg.mL-1, after 24 hrs the viability of the L929 cells decreased in the presence of CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles, which suggests moderate cytotoxic effects. These results agree with previous \n\nIntens ity (%)\n\nInte nsity (%)\n\nIntens ity (%)Intens ity (%)\n\nInte nsity (%)Inte nsity (%)\n\n(A) \n\n(B) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

Moreover, our findings are also consistent with previous ones indicating that high molecular \n\nweight structures may exhibit more serious cytotoxic effects [33]. However, such trends are meaningful \n\nonly when the same type of polymer is compared.  \n\nFigure 4 shows the luminescent cell viability assay that was carried out after culturing the RBMSCs in \n\nthe presence of different concentrations of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles for 24 and 72 hrs. \n\nThis assay is a homogeneous method based on the quantification of ATP and thus a more feasible test \n\nfor assessing the cytotoxicity of materials, since it signals the presence of metabolically active cells. The \n\nluminescence signal is proportional to the amount of ATP, which in turn is directly proportional to the \n\nnumber of cells in the culture medium. Statistically, it is possible to observe that increasing \n\nconcentrations of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not affect the viability (ATP content) of \n\nRBMSCs, after 24 hrs (p > 0.05).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Similar data \n\nwas observed on the viability of L929 cells, which provides further evidence of the low cytotoxic effects \n\nof the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the range of concentrations &lt;1 mg.mL-1. \n\n3.3. INTERNALIZATION EFfiCIENCY OF THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES  \n\nSeveral studies [5,9,38,39] have been performed to clarify the entry and retention mechanisms of \n\nnanoparticles on mammalian cells as well as to investigate cells death [40]. For instance, it has been \n\nreported [5] that the cationic surface charge of particles is responsible for their interactions with the \n\nanionic glycoproteins and phospholipids of the cell membrane surface, possibilitating the internalization. \n\nIn the present case, it is expected that these types of interactions are responsible for the entry of \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles into the cell cytosol, either by passive transport caused \n\nthrough perturbations of the membrane or by endocytosis [5]. After being trapped within the endosome, \n\nthe nanoparticles must be released into the cytosol before being subjected to acidic and/or enzymatic \n\ndegradation. Nevertheless, due to the presence of protonated residues in the chain of the CMCht, which \n\nhas a buffer capacity, it is expected that these nanoparticles can retard the degradation caused by \n\nacidification or enzymatic degradation within the endosomes. Theoretically, when loaded with drugs or \n\nDNA this type of nanocarriers may increase the availability of drugs inside the cells or the transfection \n\nefficiency. In this study, the internalization and intracellular end-condition of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles were investigated by grafting a fluorescent label probe (FITC). This study was firstly \n\nperformed using a SaOs-2 cell line and later on RBMSCs. Figure 5 shows the fluorescence microscopy \n\nimages of SaOs-2 cells cultured in the presence of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles. The nanoparticles tested in this experiment consisted of the fraction of the total with size \n\n&lt;220 nm, which was easily obtained by a filtration technique. It is apparent that CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles (green) were present at the SaOs-2 cells membrane walls only in low numbers \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

However, \n\nafter 24 hrs it is clearly seen that CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were internalized and widely \n\ndistributed in the cytoplasm of SaOs-2 cells (Figure 5C). Moreover, there is also evidence of the \n\npresence of nanoparticles in the cell nuclei, as observed by the colocalization of the nuclei marker (blue) \n\nand FITC fluorescence (green). Cells continued to internalize the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles (higher fluorescent signals) when cultured for longer periods of time, retaining their \n\nproliferation rate and remaining viable (Figure 5D).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.

In Figures 5C-D, it is seen that SaOs-2 exhibited a normal size and round nuclei with \n\nhomogeneous chromatin. Microscopic observations during the course of cell culturing in the presence of \n\nFITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles showed no morphological changes or cellular \n\nsenescence, which is a good indication of cell survival.

These results also \n\nhighlight the fact that the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are quite stable, since \n\ntheir fluorescence was maintained over a period of 14 d. The fact that internalization of the \n\nnanoparticles was not well observed after 3 hrs can be attributed to the rather high detection limit of the \n\nfluorescence microscope. FACS analysis was performed towards circumventing this limitation. In this \n\nanalysis, primary cultures and FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a concentration \n\nof 0.01 mg.mL-1 were used. This concentration is impossible to detect by fluorescence microscopy and \n\ntherefore makes a good test case for FACS. \n\nFigure 6 shows the results of FACS analysis after culturing the RBMSCs in the presence of the FITC-\n\nlabeled  CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles for times up to 14 d. Flow-cytometry studies revealed \n\nincreasing levels of fluorescence associated with cells after incubation of RBMSCs with CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles for the period of 12 hrs to 7 d. The present data show that nanoparticles were \n\ninternalized with high efficiency by RBMSCs. The fraction of RBMSCs that internalized the nanoparticles \n\nreached 50.3% after 12 hrs and a maximum of 95.7% after 7 d of culturing (Table 1). Then, at day 14 a \n\ndecrease of the internalization is detected which may be related to the fact that RBMSCs reach \n\nconfluence around day 7. Moreover, the RBMSCs were stained with propidium iodide to quantify the \n\nfraction of live cells.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6.

This result \n\nalso demonstrates the biocompatible nature of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles.  \n\nTable 1. FACS data of the percentage of internalization of FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles by the fraction of live RBMSCs, after the period of 12 hrs until 14 d.

RBMSCs continued to internalize the nanoparticles (higher \n\nfluorescent signals) when cultured for longer periods of time. Additionally, RBMSCs were also stained \n\nwith Texas-red phalloidin for observation of the cell cytoskeletons. This makes it possible to assess \n\nwhether the presence of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles affects the \n\ncytoskeleton. It is known that cell mutations involve rearrangements and morphological modifications \n\n[41]. From careful examinations it was concluded that no morphological changes could be detected \n\ncompared to the control (data not shown). Interestingly, it appears that the FITC-labeled \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are confined inside vesicular bodies resembling endosomes. \n\nThis observation would support the idea that their transport may occur through an endocytotic \n\ntranscellular pathway. As was also observed for SaOS-2 cells, there is evidence of the presence of \n\nnanoparticles in the RBMSCs nucleus.  \n\n \n\nCulture Conditions \n\n(medium) \n\n% internalization (% gated) % of live RBMSCs (PI stained) \n\n12 hrs 24 hrs 7 d 14 d 12 hrs 24 hrs 7 d 14 d \n\n \n\nFITC-labeled \n\nCMCht/PAMAM \n\nnanoparticles \n\n50.3 70.1 95.7 89.3 96.0 93.7 75.4 62.6 \n\n \n\nMEM medium (control) \n\n0.4 0.6 0.3 0.5 87.6 92.9 81.8 53.9 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

MECHANISM OF CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES INTERNALIZATION \n\nIn order to gain further insights on the internalization mechanism, complementary experiments were \n\ncarried out. The in vitro experimental design consisted of culturing the RBMSCs in the presence of \n\nFITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles and restrictive endocytotic drugs such as colchicine [5]. It is \n\nknown that colchicine binds tightly to microtubules causing microtubule depolymerisation, and by this \n\nmechanism affects endocytosis.  \n\nOn the other hand, it has been reported [42,43] that the translocation of macromolecules larger than       \n\n10 nm from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is via active transport through the nuclear pore complex \n\n(NPC), whereas small molecules and proteins smaller than 20-40 kDa cross the 10 nm diameter \n\nchannels of the NPC by passive diffusion. Thus, we also expose the RBMSCs to apyrase, a nuclear \n\ntranslocator inhibitor that causes ATP depletion, to study whether this treatment affects translocation of \n\nthe FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. \n\nFigure 8 shows the percentage of RBMSCs-associated fluorescence due to nanoparticle internalization \n\nafter culturing the cells in the presence and/or absence of the restrictive drugs, for periods of 12 hrs,     \n\n24 hrs, 7 d and 14 d. The results show that when culturing the RBMSCs in the presence of colchicine \n\n50 ?m 50 ?m\n\n50 ?m50 ?m\n\n50 ?m50 ?m50 ?m 50 ?m50 ?m50 ?m\n\n50 ?m50 ?m50 ?m50 ?m\n\n(C) \n\n(A) \n\n(D) \n\n(B) \n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI. Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n\n \n \n- 246 - \n \n \n\n(green peak), apyrase (dark-blue peak) or exposed to both (red peak), a decrease in nanoparticle \n\ninternalization is always observed. In fact, when colchicine is not present in the culture medium the \n\nnanoparticle internalization efficiency doubles for the culturing periods comprising the first 24 hrs. \n\nHowever, the difference is not so pronounced after 7 and 14 d. Therefore, the present studies support \n\nthe idea that not only nanoparticle internalization is highly dependent on the endocytosis mechanism, \n\nbut also suggest that nanoparticles enter cells by a mechanism that might not be exclusively \n\nendocytotic. As previously discussed, the size of nanoparticles strongly dictates the mechanism by \n\nwhich they are internalized [27,44]. The nanoparticles described herein have sizes ranging from \n\napproximately 6 to 220 nm, and thus may be internalized by different mechanisms, i.e. cellular uptake of \n\nparticles either by passive transport caused through perturbations of the membrane, endocytosis, and \n\nphagocytosis [5,27]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8.

Surface engineered carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles for intracellular targeting \n\n \n \n\n- 247 - \n \n \n\nOn the other hand, FACS analysis showed that apyrase exposure did not affect nanoparticle \n\ninternalization to a great extent after 7 and 14 d. However, after 24 hrs the observed internalization \n\nvalues with apyrase exposure (dark-blue peak) are significantly lower when compared to those of \n\nnanoparticle internalization without apyrase exposure (black peaks).  \n\nRBMSCs exposed to the restrictive drugs were also observed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 9). \n\nAs shown in Figure 9C, it was observed that the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nwere internalized and widely distributed in the cytoplasm of RBMSCs, and the cells exhibited a normal \n\nmorphology after 14 d. On the other hand, the depletion of ATP in the cells exposed to apyrase resulted \n\nin a decrease in nanoparticle internalization, which is more evident under fluorescence microscopy \n\nobservation than by FACS analysis (Figure 9D). A preferential localization around the perinuclear area \n\nwas observed when the cells were treated with apyrase. It should be noted that the cells were not \n\nexposed to permeabilizing agents to avoid any undesired effects on the integrity of the cell nuclei. This \n\nresult suggests that the presence of apyrase also prevents the nanocarriers from entering the cell \n\nnuclei, at least to a certain extent, since small molecules cross the 10 nm diameter channels of the NPC \n\nby passive diffusion. However, further complimentary studies are needed to clearly elucidate the \n\npossible localization of nanoparticles in the nucleus and whether nuclear import is an energy-dependent \n\nactive process, since no ATP and/or GTP regenerating systems or temperature-dependent assays were \n\ncarried out [42,43]. On the other hand, when colchicine was present in the culture medium a dramatic \n\ndecrease in nanoparticle internalization was observed (Figures 9E-F). In other words, the presence of \n\ncolchicine restricted nanoparticle internalization. Additionally, the exposure of RBMSCs to colchicine \n\nseems to prevent the formation of vesicular structures, as evidenced by the observation of uniform \n\nfluorescence of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles around the perinuclear area. \n\nThis assay further suggests that nanoparticles enter in the cells by a mechanism that is not exclusively \n\nendocytotic. The colchicine treatment negatively affected cell growth, i.e. only a small number of stained \n\nnuclei were observed. Cytoskeleton morphology (Figures 9B, E and F) is also altered as evidenced by \n\nthe increase in length of actin filaments when comparing to that of control (Figure 9A). This is not \n\nsurprisingly, since it is well known that colchicine disrupts the cytoskeleton [45]. Tsai et al. [46] reported \n\nthat colchicine at concentrations less than 1 ?M caused disruption of microtubular structures of \n\nneutrophiles, but had little effect on either F-actin or on cellular mechanical properties. On the other \n\nhand, higher concentrations of colchicine disrupted microtubular structure, but also caused increased \n\nactin polymerization and cell rigidity. Thus, the present data demonstrate that the CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles have great potential for various applications as intracellular nanocarriers since \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

IN VITRO RELEASE OF DEXAMETHASONE FROM THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES \n\nGlucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (Dex) have been shown [48-50] to promote the osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of stem cells. On the other hand glucocorticoids bind to the cytoplasmatic glucocorticoid \n\nreceptor [51,52].  Therefore, Dex is the ideal drug to further investigate the loading and performance of the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles as an intracellular drug delivery system. Figure 10 depicts the \n\nDex release profile from CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at physiological pH. We have studied \n\nthe effect of serum proteins on the retention of Dex by adding 15% fetal bovine serum, FBS to PBS \n\nsolution.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 10. Dexamethasone release from CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles 1 mg.mL-1 at pH 7.4 \n\nPBS buffer in the presence (-?-) or absence (-?-) of 15% FBS under agitation at 37\u00b0C, 60 rpm and \n\ndetermined by high performance liquid chromatography for the period of 1 h until 7 d. The results are \n\nexpressed as an average \u00b1 standard deviation, n=6. \n\nA initial burst release of Dex is observed and the concentration reaches a maximum of 4 \u00b5g.mL-1 in \n\nPBS with 15% FBS, after 24 hrs. The release kinetics of Dex followed a steady release after the initial \n\nburst, which lasted for 7d. This data shows that Dex is released as free drug. The release of Dex from \n\nnanoparticles seems to be very slow for about 6 days after the initial release period, in the presence of \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

By comparing the release rate of Dex in absence of serum proteins, it can be seen that \n\nDex is released more slowly, after the initial burst period and a higher amount of Dex is still being \n\nreleased at this second stage. This data shows that the presence of serum proteins increases the initial \n\namount of Dex released from the nanoparticles. This data is in agreement with previous study [53], and \n\nmay be related to nanoparticles degradation by serum proteins. Despite, further degradation studies \n\nneed to be carried out to elucidate this issue. The time scale for the Dex release from the nanoparticles \n\nis of the same order of their internalization by cells. This could provide an indication of retention of \n\ndexamethasone within nanoparticles in culture media and its release rate after has been internalized by \n\ncells, in vitro.  This and other issues such as what will be the Dex release profile inside the endosomes \n\n(pH 5) and in vivo situation remains to be examined in future studies. \n\n3.6. IN VITRO OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION OF RBMSCS EXPOSED TO THE CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER \n\nNANOPARTICLES \n\nOsteodifferentiation study is an interesting in vitro model to validate the incorporation and release of \n\ndexamethasone from the nanocarriers, since osteogenic differentiation varies with the dose and \n\nduration of exposure to the glucocorticoids [48]. On the other hand, in vitro osteogenic differentiation of \n\nstem cells mimics many characteristics of the normal osteogenesis occurring in vivo. Under appropriate \n\nculture conditions stem cells are induced to express osteogenic markers such as bone-specific alkaline \n\nphosphatase (ALP), osteopontin and osteocalcin [49,54]. The deposition of an extracellular matrix namely \n\ntype I collagen may occur, and as a consequence mineralization can be observed [50,55,56]. Calcium \n\npresence is a late marker of osteoblast differentiation. In this work, the mineralization was qualitatively \n\ninvestigated using the Alizarin red staining (Figure 11). These results have shown that RBMSCs \n\ncultures exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles showed high mineralization, \n\nas seen by the calcium staining (Figures 11C-D). The extent of calcium deposition in cultures exposed \n\nto Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a final concentration of 0.01 mg.mL-1 was of \n\nsame magnitude as in cultures treated with of standard culture media with Dex (osteogenic media), \n\nwhile RBMSCs cultured in the presence of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles showed no \n\nmineralized nodules (Figure 11B). This is an important data since it shows that incorporation \n\ndexamethasone and nanoparticles concentration influence the intensity and extent of mineralization. \n\nMoreover, it can be seen an overall increase of calcium deposition in cultures exposed to Dex as \n\ncompared to those lacking the glucocorticoid (Figures 11A, B and F). The in vitro release studies \n\nshowed that Dex concentration reaches a maximum of 4 \u00b5g.mL-1 in PBS with 15% FBS, after 24 hrs. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

These range of concentrations of Dex has been shown to be effective for the \n\nosteogenic differentiation of MSCs [48,57]. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 11.

To \n\nconfirm the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles, we carried out an ALP staining (Figure 12). As seen in calcium staining, presence of the \n\nclusters of cuboid-shaped stained with ALP is higher in cultures exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles (Figures 12C-D). It is possible to observe a strong ALP staining in cultures with \n\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles at a concentration of 0.01 mg.mL-1.

No statistical \n\ndifferences were observed for cultures grown in the presence osteogenic medium and standard culture \n\nmedia with different concentrations of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles.

It is possible to observe that osteocalcin \n\ndeposition occur in cultures exposed to the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. \n\nIn addition, higher osteocalcin content in cultures treated with osteogenic media can be seen. Despite, \n\nthe magnitude of osteocalcin deposition do not present significant differences when comparing to that of \n\ncultures with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. These observations \n\ncan be explained by the fact that differentiation proceed to mineralization and the responsiveness of \n\nosteocalcin synthesis to long-term exposure to Dex, as this late marker appears to reach a maximum \n\njust before or during mineralized tissue formation [59]. Therefore, the present biochemical findings \n\ndemonstrate that RBMSCs differentiate into osteoblasts and organize into a mineralized matrix when \n\nculturing in the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles.  \n\n0\n\n1 000\n\n2 000\n\n3 000\n\n4 000\n\n5 000\n\n6 000\n\nFEDCBA\n\nA\nL\n\nP\n a\n\nc\ntiv\n\nit\ny/\n\nD\nN\n\nA\n c\n\no\nnt\n\nen\nt\n\n0\n\n5000\n\n1 0000\n\n1 5000\n\n2 0000\n\n2 5000\n\nFEDCBA\n\nn\nm\n\no\nl/\n\nw\ne\nll/\n\n30\n m\n\nin\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.

In recent \n\nyears targeted drug delivery nanoparticle based systems for intracellular application have been put \n\nforward has a possible therapeutic route to follow. In this sense the objective of the present report was \n\nto characterize and evaluate the possible applicability of the recently developed \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) (CMCht/PAMAM) dendrimer nanoparticles for central nervous \n\nsystem (CNS) regenerative medicine. Atomic force and transmission electron microscopy observations \n\nhave revealed that the nanoparticles possessed a nanosphere-like shape, with a mean size ranging \n\nfrom 22.0 to 30.7 nm. Moreover it was also possible to confirm by UV-Vis spectrophotometry that these \n\nnanoparticles could be bound to the fluorescent-probe fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) for tracing \n\npurposes. Experiments with post-natal hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells revealed that both \n\ncell populations were able to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles with \n\nhigh efficiency. The internalization rates changed according to the cell populations, reaching a peak \n\nafter 48 hours of incubation. Overall astrocytes and microglial cells disclosed higher internalization rates \n\n(around 100% of the total cell sub-population) followed by neurons and oligodendrocytes (up to 80-90% \n\nof the observed cells). Further experiments for periods up to 7 days revealed that the periodical addition \n\nof FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was needed to maintain the levels of \n\ninternalization. This fact was attributed to the proliferation of neuroprogenitors, astrocytes and \n\noligodendrocytes in hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells cultures, respectively. Finally, it was \n\nalso observed that cell viability and proliferation were not significantly affected by the presence of the \n\nabove referred nanoparticles. Further studies will be focused on loading relevant drugs for future CNS \n\napplications. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter is based on the following publication: Oliveira JM, Salgado AJ, Pirraco RP , Pereira VH, Fraga \n\nJS, Marques AP, Neves NM, Mano JF, Reis RL and Sousa N, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

INTRODUCTION \n\nCentral nervous system associated disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide. Although in \n\nrecent years several new drugs have been put forward to tackle problems such as Parkinson\u2019s and \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, and Spinal Cord Injury, one still faces the low efficacy that the \n\nlatter are delivered into the brain. The greatest treatment obstacle is not the drug potency itself, but \n\nrather the physical barriers, such as the blood brain barrier (BBB), that render the typical circulatory \n\nroutes of delivery ineffective [1-3].  In fact the same mechanisms that protect the brain from foreign \n\nsubstances, also restrict the entry of many potentially therapeutic agents [1-4], such as larger molecular \n\nweight molecules, like peptides, proteins and oligonucleotides [1,3]. Therefore there is an urgent need for \n\nthe development of new routes that can efficiently overcome this problem. \n\nOne of such routes could be trough the use of nanomedicine based approaches, namely those dealing \n\nwith the development of targeted drug delivery nanoparticle-based systems. The latter do not only \n\npossess the advantage of their size, but simultaneously could be surface engineered in order to present \n\nthe adequate properties (e.g. surface chemistry) that would allow them to cross the BBB [1,4]. In general \n\nterms, drugs could be dissolved, entrapped, encapsulated or attached to a nanoparticle matrix, serving \n\nin this sense as a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d for a variety of chemical and biological entities [5-7]. Moreover as they \n\nare normally able to be internalized by CNS derived cells, they could be quite useful in the modulation of \n\nthe activity of neuronal/glial cells intracellular receptors.   \n\nBaring this in mind several nanoparticle based systems have been developed throughout the years. For \n\ninstance, different authors have shown that poly(butyl)cyanoacrylate based nanoparticles could be used \n\nas efficient dug delivery agents within the brain [8-11]. Other studies [12-15] have also revealed that \n\nliposomes, which commonly disclosed a non-toxic and biodegradable behaviour, could be quite effective \n\nfor the transport of drugs into the brain. Still within this topic, dendrimers have also been put forward as \n\nyet another route for the above referred applications [16-19]. Dendrimers are synthetic highly branched, \n\nspherical, monodisperse macromolecules of nanometer dimension [16]. They are easily internalized by \n\ncells, property that might be of use if the goal is to deal with, for instance, intracellular receptors of CNS \n\nderived cells. Their multiple surface functional groups can be easily modified to potentially attack a large \n\nnumber of ligands for a selected targeted drug delivery application, while its inner hydrophobic core is \n\namenable for drug entrapment [16,20,21]. However, the non-covalent encapsulation of drugs into \n\ndendrimers presents a general drawback as it is difficult to control the release of the molecules from the \n\ndendrimer core [21]. Furthermore, in order to increase the rate of drug incorporation, it is common to use \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles in central nervous system regenerative medicine: \n\nEffects on neurons/glial cell viability/proliferation and internalization efficiency \n\n \n \n- 266 - \n \n\nhigher generation of dendrimers (G7) with amine capping-groups which has been shown to cause \n\nhaemolysis and changes in red cell morphology, leading to a general overall cytotoxic behaviour [22].  \n\nIn order to obviate these problems Oliveira et al. [23] have recently proposed a new strategy consisting \n\non poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer core with grafted carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) chains. By \n\ndoing so, this novel class of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles could display a higher loading \n\ncapacity due to peripheral congestion, which can improve container properties, and also can allow the \n\nbulk incorporation of bioactive molecules of higher molecular weights and of different chemistry. \n\nSimultaneously they could maintain the high internalization efficiency with improved biological \n\nproperties, when compared to conventional dendrimers [23].  \n\nFollowing on this initial report the objectives of the present work consists in determining the possible \n\napplication of these systems for CNS related applications by studying their role on the viability and \n\nproliferation of hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells, as well as to investigate the internalization \n\nrate of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by the latter. Results revealed that CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles were not deleterious to both hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells and \n\ndid not impaired cell proliferation in these two systems. Furthermore it was also possible to observe that \n\nneurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglial cells were able to internalize the CMCht/PAMAM \n\nnanoparticles at different rates. The latter varied along the different cell populations, but overall started \n\nafter 1 hour of incubation reaching a peak, that ranged between 80-100%, after 48 hours of exposure. \n\nMoreover it was also observed, namely for oligodendrocytes and neurons, that the periodical addition of \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was needed to maintain the internalization rate for periods of \n\nup to 7 days in culture.  \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES SYNTHESIS \n\nThe synthesis of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was carried out as described elsewhere \n\n[23]. Succinctly, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were prepared using a step-by-step method: (i) \n\nincreasing the generation of the PAMAM-carboxylic terminated dendrimer, PAMAM-CT (G 1.5), (ii) \n\nobtaining a PAMAM-methyl ester terminated dendrimer, (iii) reaction of PAMAM with \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan possessing a degree of deacetylation of 80% and degree of substitution of 47%. \n\nThen, the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were precipitated after addition of an appropriate \n\nvolume of a saturated sodium carbonate, Na2CO3 (Aldrich, Germany) solution and acetone (Pronalab, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles in central nervous system regenerative medicine: \n\nEffects on neurons/glial cell viability/proliferation and internalization efficiency \n\n \n \n\n- 267 - \n \n\nPortugal), under vigorous agitation. Precipitates were collected by filtration, dispersed in ultra-pure water \n\nfor extensive dialysis and freeze-dried (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain) at -80\u00baC. In order to trade down the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles within the intracellular compartment the latter were labeled \n\nwith fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC (Sigma, Germany).  For this purpose conjugates of FITC-labeled \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were prepared by covalently bonding the amine group of \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan and the isothyocianate group of FITC (thiourea bond). The labeling efficiency \n\nwas investigated by UV-Vis spectrophotometry (NanoDropTM ND-1000; NanoDrop Technologies, USA) \n\nby reading the absorvance at 280 nm and 495 nm, and the determination of FITC:CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles molar ratio calculated using a standard curve. \n\n2.2. CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES PHYSICAL CHARACTERIZATION \n\nThe morphology of the nanoparticles was investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The \n\nfreeze-dried CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dispersed in ultrapure water to obtain a \n\nsolution with final concentration of 1 mg.mL-1, and then 20 ?L was placed over a 9.9 mm mica disc \n\n(Agar Scientific, England) and blown dried with nitrogen gas for subsequent characterization. The \n\nsamples were analyzed using the Tapping Mode\u2122 with a MultiMode AFM connected to a NanoScope III \n\ncontroller, both from Veeco, USA, with non-contact silicon nanoprobes (ca 300 kHz) from Nanosensors, \n\nSwitzerland. All images were plane-fitted using the third degree-flatten procedure included in the \n\nNanoScope software version 4.43r8. The morphometric analysis was performed using the same \n\nsoftware. Complementarily, the morphology of the particles was also analysed under a transmission \n\nelectron microscope, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The Netherlands, equipped with a MEGA \n\nVIEW-II DOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT DOCU).  \n\n2.3. CELL CULTURE \n\n2.3.1. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons \n\nHippocampal neuron cultures were prepared from P4 Wistar rats [24]. Upon dissection, hippocampus \n\ntissue samples were submitted to trypsin based enzymatic digestion (0.05% Trypsin \u2013 Gibco; 3 mg.mL-1 \n\nBSA \u2013 Sigma; 0.0025% DNase \u2013 Sigma, in EBSS - Gibco) for 10 minutes, followed by mechanical \n\ndissociation and centrifugation. Isolated cells were then plated on poly-D-lysine coated coverslips at a \n\ndensity of 4 x 104 cells.cm-2. Cultures were maintained (37\u00b0C, 5% CO2/95% air, 90% relative humidity) \n\nin Neurobasal A medium/B27 supplemented with 1 mM Glutamax I, 10 ng.mL-1 basic fibroblast growth \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

From day seven onwards \n\ntwo sets of experiments were performed: 1) In order to determine the internalization time of FITC-\n\nlabeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles by hippocampal neurons, cultures were incubated with \n\n200 ?g.mL-1 nanoparticles for periods of 1, 2, 6, 12, 15, 18, 24 and 48 hours; 2) To understand whether \n\nthe  maintenance of the CMCht/PAMAM concentration in the culture medium was essential to maintain \n\nthe levels of internalization, cultures were incubated for periods up to 7 days in which CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles were added to the culture medium every 48 hours in one group, while in the \n\nother nanoparticles were only added on the first day of the experiment.  \n\n2.3.2. Primary cultures of cortical glial cells  \n\nCortical glial cells were isolated from P4 newborns (Wistar Rats) as previously described [25]. Upon \n\ndissection, cortices were submitted to an enzymatic cocktail (30 mg.mL-1 DNase, 0.25% Trypsin, both \n\nfrom Sigma) in Ca2+/Mg2+ free HBSS (Gibco)  followed by mechanical dissociation. Glial cells were then \n\nobtained by centrifuging the cells suspension at 800 rpm for 2 minutes, and plated out on coverslips \n\npreviously coated with Poly-D-Lysine at a density of 4 x 104 cells.cm-2. Glial cells were then maintained \n\nfor one week in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 1% antibiotics/antimycotics solution and 10% FBS. \n\nAt this time point similar experiments to those performed with hippocampal cultures were carried out. In \n\norder to determine if astrocytes and oligodendrocyte cells proliferation was affecting internalization rate \n\nafter 7 days of incubation with or without renovation, cultures were treated at day 7 with \u20185-fluoro-2\u2019-\n\ndeoxiuridina (FDU, Sigma), a known inhibitor of glial cell proliferation. \n\n2.3.3. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons \n\nCortical glial cells were isolated from P4 newborns (Wistar Rats) as previously described [25]. Upon \n\ndissection, cortices were submitted to an enzymatic cocktail (30 mg.mL-1 DNase, 0.25% Trypsin, both \n\nfrom Sigma) in Ca2+/Mg2+ free HBSS (Gibco)  followed by mechanical dissociation.

MTS ASSAY \n\nFor both neurons and glial cells, cell viability was assessed by the MTS test, after 7 days of incubation \n\n(with or without renovation) with FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. The MTS  (3-\n\n(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium) (Promega, \n\nUSA) test is an assay in which the substrate \u2013 MTS \u2013 is bioreduced into a brown formazan product by \n\nNADPH or NADP produced by mitochondrial enzymes, which are active in living cells [26,27]. This assay, \n\nor others similar to it (MTT, WST-1), have been widely used to measure cellular viability and \n\nproliferation. Hippocampal neurons and glial cells cultures (n=3) were placed in culture medium \n\ncontaining MTS in a 5:1 ratio and incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00baC and 5% CO2. After \n\nthree hours of incubation 100 ?L of solution from each well were transferred to 96-well plates and the \n\noptical density was determined at 490 nm.  \n\n2.5. TOTAL PROTEIN QUANTIFICATION \n\nIn order to complement the data obtained with the MTS test, total protein was quantified by using the \n\nBCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce Chemical, USA). This system uses bicinchoninic acid (BCA) as the \n\ndetection reagent for Cu+1, which is formed when Cu+2 is reduced by protein in an alkaline environment. \n\nThe purple coloured reaction product is formed by the chelation of two molecules of BCA with one \n\ncuprous ion (Cu+1). Cells were lysed in ultra-pure H2O after which the total protein was quantified \n\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. At the end of the assay, 100 ?L of each sample were \n\ntransferred to 96-well plates where a standard curve was prepared and the absorbance read at 562 nm \n\nin a multi-well plate reader (Tecan, USA). \n\n2.6. IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY \n\nFollowing each culture period, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes, \n\npermeabilized by incubation with 100% methanol for 2 minutes at room temperature, and washed three \n\ntimes in PBS. Cells were then blocked with 10% FBS/PBS (60 minutes) and followed by a 60 minutes \n\nincubation with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-rat microtubule associated protein-2    \n\n(MAP-2) (Sigma, USA, 1:500) to detect mature hippocampal neurons, rabbit anti-rat glial fibrillary acid \n\nprotein (GFAP) (Dako, Denmark, 1:500) for astrocytes, mouse anti-CD11b (BD Biosciences Pharmigen, \n\nUSA, 1:100) for microglial cells and mouse anti-O4 (R&amp;D systems, USA, 1:50) for oligodendrocytes. \n\nCells were then washed in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody: Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

The primary antibody was omitted to produce negative controls. Samples were further \n\nobserved under an Olympus BX-61 Fluorescence Microscope (Olympus, Germany). Levels of        \n\nFITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization by the different cell population \n\nwas achieved by the following (n=3, 5 random fields/coverslip): \n\n% of positive cells for internalization= number of cells positive for FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles internalization/total number of cells \n\n2.7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS \n\nStatistical evaluation was performed using one way ANOVA (internalization times experiments) and two-\n\ntailed paired t-student tests (MTS, total protein, comparison between renovation and no-renovation of \n\nFITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture medium), to assess the statistical \n\ndifferences between different groups. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05 for a 95% \n\nconfidence interval.  \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nIn the present study we aimed at determining the interactions between a new class of nanoparticle \n\nbased systems, known as CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, with hippocampal neurons and \n\ncortical glial cells in order to develop future strategies for CNS regenerative medicine. For this purpose \n\nthe CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles were firstly characterized under AFM and TEM after which \n\nhippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells were exposed to the latter for different culture periods.  \n\nInitially and in order to further characterize the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles an AFM study \n\nwas performed to both evaluate their size and morphology (Figure 1). From Figure 1A it is possible to \n\nobserve the 3-D AFM image of the PAMAM-carboxylic terminated (G1.5) dendrimers. This data reveals \n\nthe monodispersive character of these macromolecules. On the other hand, Figure 1B shows the 3-D \n\nimage of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, which clearly shows the consistency of these \n\nmolecules, i.e. nanosphere-like shape. By performing a threshold technique it became possible to \n\nperform the morphometric analysis of the latter. This study revealed that the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles have a mean size ranging from 22.0 to 30.7 nm for a confidence level of 95%, and a \n\nconfidence level of \u00b1 4.4 (Figure 1D). This data was further confirmed by TEM analysis (Figure 1E) that \n\nrevealed the nanosphere-like morphology of the nanoparticles.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

MTS test (Figure 2) was used \n\nin order to determine the cell viability/metabolic activity of hippocampal neurons and cortical glial cells.   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.

MTS results showed that the \n\nmetabolic activity/cell viability of both cell populations was not dramatically altered between the two \n\ntested groups. Similar results were also obtained for the total protein quantification (n=3, mean + SD, \n\np>0.05). \n\nResults revealed that both cell populations were producing large amounts of a brown formazan product \n\nwhich is an indication of normal cell viability and metabolism, as cells were able to incorporate and \n\nGlial cells cultured with CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nHippocampal Neurons cultured with CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

However it should be referred that for the hippocampal neurons there was a slight \n\ndifference, non significant (p>0.05), between the two groups. This effect could be attributed to the \n\nperiodical renovation of the CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles concentration, as the latter lead to a small \n\nacidification of the culture medium  \n\nThe data obtained with the MTS test was subsequently confirmed by a total protein quantification assay \n\n(Figure 2), which can be considered as an indication of cell proliferation. Similar to the results achieved \n\nby the MTS test, some slight or no differences were found between the tested and control samples \n\n(p>0.05), and therefore it was demonstrated that cell proliferation of both cell populations in the two \n\ntested conditions was not affected by the presence the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. \n\nAfter testing if the CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles had any deleterious effect on cell viability and \n\nproliferation of both neuronal and glial cell populations, the objectives of the present report were focused \n\non the determination of the internalization time and rate in two different sets of experiments. Figure 3 \n\nshows the results obtained in primary cultures of post-natal hippocampal neurons. As it can be observed \n\nhippocampal neurons were able to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendronized \n\nnanoparticles (Figure 3A, after 24 hours of exposure to a concentration of 200 ?g.mL-1). Furthermore \n\nthe same experiments also revealed that the internalization rate tended to increase with time, presenting \n\nthree different plateaus: 1) between 1-3 hours the rates are around 5-10%; 2) between 6-18 hours \n\naround 40-50% and 3) after 18 hours the values were above 50%. Groups 1-3 hours presented \n\nstatistically significant difference (p<0.05) when compared to groups 15 to 48 hours.  Another feature \n\nnoticed with these experiments was the high variability (high standard deviations) obtained among the \n\ndifferent incubation time. This fact indicates that not all hippocampal neurons disclosed the same \n\ninternalization response at earlier incubation time points. However, and as can be observed in         \n\nFigure 3B, this tendency tended to fade way with time as after 24 and 48 hours the obtained results \n\nwere much more homogenous, as it can be seen by the indicative values of the error bars.  Although it \n\nwas not an objective of the present study to understand the mechanisms by which CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles are internalized by hippocampal neurons, similar experiments performed with \n\nother cell populations [23] indicate that this phenomena is mediated by endocytosis followed by \n\nendosomal transport within the intracellular compartment. Finally, it was also observed that the \n\nperiodical renovation of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture \n\nmedium is essential for the maintenance of the internalization rates by hippocampal neuron populations \n\n(Figures 3C-D, p<0.05). It is believed that this fact is related with the proliferation of other cell \n\npopulations present in this culture system, namely neuroprogenitor cells.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

Post-natal hippocampal neurons were able to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles (A). Initially neuronal cells disclosed a high variability on the capacity of \n\ninternalizing the nanoparticles. However results tended to be more homogeneous after 24 hours of \n\nincubations, reaching a maximum of internalization (around 80-90%) after 48 hours of incubation (B). \n\nFurther experiments (C-E) also showed that the maintenance of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticle concentration in the culture medium was essential to maintain the levels of \n\ninternalization. The differences observed in C-E were attributed to the proliferation of other cell \n\npopulations within the hippocampal neuron cultures, namely neuroprogenitor cells (n=3;                          \n\n5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p<0.05). \n\n%\n o\n\nf \nM\n\nA\nP\n\n-2\n p\n\no\nsi\n\nti\nve\n\n c\ne\n\nlls\n f\n\no\nr \n\n \n\nC\nM\n\nC\nh\n\nt/\nP\n\nA\nM\n\nA\nM\n\n in\nte\n\nrn\na\n\nliz\na\n\ntio\nn\n \n\n%\n o\n\nf \nM\n\nA\nP\n\n-2\n p\n\no\nsi\n\nti\nve\n\n c\ne\n\nlls\n f\n\no\nr \n\n \n\nC\nM\n\nC\nh\n\nt/\nP\n\nA\nM\n\nA\nM\n\n in\nte\n\nrn\na\n\nliz\na\n\ntio\nn\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

Internalization experiments within cortical glial cell cultures showed that astrocytes were also \n\nable to internalize the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (A- after 48 hours of \n\nincubation). As it can be observed in (B) the internalization occurred in a gradual manner reaching a \n\npeak (around 100% of internalization) after 48 hours of incubation). When exposed for longer periods of \n\ntime it was observed that the periodical addition of nanoparticles to the culture medium was needed to \n\nstabilize the levels of internalization (C-E); (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p<0.05). \n\n%\n o\n\nf \nG\n\nF\nA\n\nP\n p\n\no\nsi\n\nti\nve\n\n c\ne\n\nlls\n f\n\no\nr \n\n \n\nC\nM\n\nC\nh\n\nt/\nP\n\nA\nM\n\nA\nM\n\n in\nte\n\nrn\na\n\nliz\na\n\ntio\nn\n \n\n%\n o\n\nf \nG\n\nF\nA\n\nP\n p\n\no\nsi\n\nti\nve\n\n c\ne\n\nlls\n f\n\no\nr \n\n \n\nC\nM\n\nC\nh\n\nt/\nP\n\nA\nM\n\nA\nM\n\n in\nte\n\nrn\na\n\nliz\na\n\ntio\nn\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII. Carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles in central nervous system regenerative medicine: \n\nEffects on neurons/glial cell viability/proliferation and internalization efficiency \n\n \n \n- 276 - \n \n\nThis fact is noteworthy to mention, as in the culture system used in the present work all glial cell types \n\nwere present, and therefore is an indicative that the nanoparticles under study are not preferentially up \n\ntaken and consequently phagocytised by microglial cells. Nevertheless, all glial cell populations \n\ndisclosed different internalization patterns. For instance, astrocytes (Figure 4) revealed a steady \n\nconstant increase on the number of positive cells for FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles internalization reaching the highest value after 48 hours of incubation (around 100%). On \n\nthe other hand oligodendrocytes (Figure 5) disclosed a similar pattern to what had been observed with \n\nhippocampal cultures, disclosing three different levels of internalization, with the highest value around \n\n80-90%. Finally, and as expected due to its phagocytotic nature, microglia (Figure 6) had the fastest and \n\nhighest rates of internalization, showing levels of around 100% after 12 hours of incubation. The \n\ndifferences obtained between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes to the same concentration of FITC-\n\nlabeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are probably related with their different endocytotic \n\ncapabilities. Moreover it was also seen that the size of the nanoparticles that could be found within the \n\nintracellular compartment varied according to the cell type observed. For instance, microglial cells \n\n(Figure 6A) tended to internalize particles with an increased size when compared to neurons (Figure 3A) \n\nand oligodendrocytes (Figure 5A). This fact is mainly related with phagocytotic activity of microglial cells, \n\nthat commonly phagocytise particles above 100 nm [1]. Moreover this data also indicate that neurons \n\nand oligodendrocytes preferentially internalize particles bellow this size. \n\nAs for the hippocampal neurons, all glia cell types, namely oligodendrocytes, had reduced \n\ninternalization rates (p<0.05) whenever FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nconcentration was not renewed in the culture medium. For microglial cels this fact was attributed to the \n\nmacrophage behaviour of the latter, which lead to the degradation of the particles within the intracellular \n\ncompartment. However for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes the observed phenomena was attributed to \n\ncell proliferation, as these cells tend to possess higher proliferation rates when compared to microglial \n\ncells. This hypothesis was further assessed by stopping cell proliferation within the cortical glial cell \n\nprimary cultures (Figure 7). In these conditions, and as it can be observed in Figure 7, no differences \n\nwere found between the two tested groups (p>0.05).  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

Within the oligodendrocyte population it was possible to \n\nobserve three plateau of internalization, being the highest obtained after 48 hours of incubation (B- \n\naround 80-90%).  Similarly to what happened with neurons and astrocytes, the maintenance of the \n\ninternalization levels within the oligodendrocyte cell population was dependent on the maintenance of \n\nthe concentration of the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the culture medium \n\n(C-E); (n=3; 5 fields/coverslip; mean + SD; p<0.05). \n\n%\n o\n\nf \nO\n\n4\n p\n\no\nsi\n\ntiv\ne\n\n c\ne\n\nlls\n f\no\n\nr \n \n\nC\nM\n\nC\nh\n\nt/\nP\n\nA\nM\n\nA\nM\n\n in\nte\n\nrn\na\n\nliz\na\n\ntio\nn\n \n\n%\n o\n\nf \nO\n\n4\n p\n\no\nsi\n\ntiv\ne\n\n c\ne\n\nlls\n f\no\n\nr \n \n\nC\nM\n\nC\nh\n\nt/\nP\n\nA\nM\n\nA\nM\n\n in\nte\n\nrn\na\n\nliz\na\n\ntio\nn\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.

CONCLUSIONS \n\nWith the present work it was possible to demonstrate that carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles disclosed a nanosphere-like shape.

Moreover, it \n\nwas possible to observe that neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and microglial cells were able to \n\ninternalize, at different rate, the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, probably \n\nthrough endocytotic processes. Finally, it was also observed that cell proliferation of astrocytes and \n\noligodendrocytes lead to a decrease on the internalization rate within their total cell populations. Further \n\nstudies will be focused on the loading of relevant drugs for CNS related applications into the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.   Emerich, D.F. and C.G.

The \n\npresent study was designed to investigate the effect of combining novel dexamethasone-loaded \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM) nanoparticles and, \n\nboth HAp and SPCL scaffolds (3-D system) on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of rat \n\nbone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) in vitro. A luminescent cell viability assay using RBMSCs was \n\nperformed for screening cytotoxicity of the developed HAp and SPCL scaffolds. Results corroborated \n\nprevious ones which have demonstrated in vitro, the superior performance of the HAp and SPCL \n\nscaffolds on supporting cells adhesion and proliferation. Furthermore, this work showed that RBMSCs \n\nseeded onto the surface of both HAp and SPCL scaffolds differentiate into osteoblasts when cultured in \n\nthe presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. In addition, results \n\ndemonstrated that Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles combined with the HAp \n\nenhance osteogenesis by increasing ALP activity and mineralization of the extracellular matrix. The pre-\n\nincubation of stem cells with these kinds of nanoparticles allows the delivery of Dex inside the cells and \n\ndirectly influences their cellular fate, being a promising new tool to be used in cells and tissue \n\nengineering strategies. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter is based on the following publication: Oliveira JM, Sousa RA, Kotobuki N, Tadokoro M, Hirose \n\nM, Mano JF, Reis RL and Ohgushi H, 2009, The osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal \n\ncells cultured with dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles, Biomaterials, 30: 804-813.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

INTRODUCTION \n\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a valuable therapeutic tool in tissue engineering (TE) [1], since they \n\ncan proliferate and differentiate either in vitro or in vivo into a multitude of distinct cellular        \n\nphenotypes [2-4]. It is well known that the process of stem cell maintenance and differentiation occurs in \n\nvitro, under optimal culture conditions [5,6]. For example, it has been shown that dexamethasone (Dex) \n\ndelivered as a medium supplement promotes the osteogenic differentiation of marrow stromal cells [4,7]. \n\nDespite its use in clinical practice [8], Dex and other glucocorticoids have been restricted to few \n\napplications mainly due to adverse side-effects [9,10]. Therefore, the development of novel strategies that \n\ncan stimulate stem cells to become osteoblasts in vitro and in vivo, and that provide a more effective \n\ntreatment route with diminished complications is still regarded as a hot issue [11] that needs to be \n\nexploited further. In this context, the use of nanocarriers that possess high cellular uptake efficiency to \n\ndeliver and target drugs can be seen as a possible and reliable solution [12]. Ultimately, these vehicles \n\nare expected to increase the solubility of drugs [13] and their bioavailability [14], and their delivery to the \n\ntargets where they are required [15,16], thus suppressing harmful secondary effects on the patients during \n\ndrug/cell based treatments.  \n\nA huge portfolio of controlled-release vehicles are being investigated for their ability to process into \n\nnanocarriers [17,18], while several new emerging nanomaterials are being studied for their \n\nbiodegradability [19,20] and for their controlled-release and stimuli-responsive properties [21,22]. In this \n\ncontext, we focus our present work on the surface engineering of poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) \n\ndendrimers with natural-based and biodegradable polymers such as the water-soluble \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) [23]. Previously [24], we have clearly demonstrated that the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles are efficiently internalized by different cell types. Since \n\nglucocorticoids bind to and activate a cytoplasmatic glucocorticoid receptor [25,26], our particular interest \n\nis in the loading of these novel macromolecular architectures with Dex in order to study their \n\ninternalization and effects on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells, in vitro and in \n\nvivo. \n\nIn this work, we applied a TE strategy consisting of the combination of stem cells and either ceramic or \n\npolymeric scaffolds as a way to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate their performance in supporting \n\nthe osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) exposed to the intracellular \n\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanocarrier. The herein chosen scaffolds were the macroporous \n\nhydroxylapatite (HAp) [27] and starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) [28,29] scaffolds which have been found to \n\nexhibit a unique architecture and adequate physicochemical and biological properties to be used in \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII. The osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells cultured with dexamethasone-loaded \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles \n\n \n\n \n \n- 288 - \n \n\nbone related applications. However, the novelty of the present paper lies in deeper in vitro studies that \n\nillustrated the potential applications of combining nanoparticles and scaffolds for cells and tissue \n\nengineering. Therefore, we went a step further and reported on the osteogenic efficacy of this system, \n\nand how to make use of this potential in bone TE and regenerative medicine. In vitro studies were \n\ncarried out in order to evaluate the viability of RBMSCs seeded onto the surface of the HAp and SPCL \n\nscaffolds. In addition, RBMSCs-scaffold constructs specimens were also examined using microscopic \n\nanalyses to assess the cell adhesion and proliferation. Complementarily, scanning electron microscopy, \n\nLIVE/DEAD viability assay and DNA quantification were carried out after 14 d of culturing. Alizarin red \n\nand ALP stainings were also performed to qualitatively assess calcium deposition and ALP activity, \n\nwhich are parameters denoting osteogenic differentiation. Quantification of the alkaline phosphatase \n\nactivity and osteocalcin content were carried out in order to evaluate the osteoblastic phenotype \n\nexpression levels.  \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. PREPARATION OF THE HYDROXYLAPATITE (HAP) AND STARCH-POLYCAPROLACTONE (SPCL) SCAFFOLDS \n\nHydroxylapatite (HAp) scaffolds were prepared by impregnating a polyurethane sacrifice sponge (PU,    \n\n5 mm diameter and 4 mm height, Eurospuma S.A., Portugal) with HAp powders obtained as previously \n\nreported [27]. The elimination of the organic matrix consisted of burning the impregnated sponges in a \n\nfurnace (Fornocer\u00e2mica-ATR 901, Portugal) at 900\u00baC for 24 hrs, then sintering at 1300\u00baC for 3 hrs.  \n\nStarch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds were produced by adopting a two step procedure as \n\npreviously reported elsewhere [28]. The material used was a blend of starch with approximately 70% by \n\nweight of poly-?-caprolactone, SPCL. Briefly, fibres of SPCL were produced by melt spinning using a \n\nmodular co-rotating twin screw extruder in two consecutive steps to a final draw ratio of approximately \n\n1:100. Then, melt spun fibres were chopped. Fibre bundles were randomly displaced into the custom-\n\ndesigned mould cavities and subjected to thermal treatment at 60\u00b0C for 30 min before compression and \n\nfibre bonding. SPCL scaffolds (5 mm diameter and 4 mm height) were obtained through cutting of fibre \n\nbonded meshes with a circular die. Standardized fabrication conditions enabled the production of \n\nscaffolds with 67.4 \u00b1 1.3% porosity (as determined by micro-computed tomography). More details on \n\nSPCL scaffolds can be found elsewhere [30,31]. \n\nPrior to the cell culture studies HAp and SPCL scaffolds were sterilized in an ethylene oxide gas \n\natmosphere.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

SYNTHESIS OF DEXAMETHASONE-LOADED CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) (DEX-LOADED \n\nCMCHT/PAMAM) DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES \n\nCarboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) was synthesized by a chemical modification of chitin (Sigma, \n\nGermany) as described by Chen et al. [32]. Starburst\u00ae poly(amidoamine)-carboxylic terminated \n\ndendrimers, PAMAM-CT (generation 1.5, 20% (w/v) methanolic solution) with an ethylenediamine core \n\nwere purchased from Aldrich. CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were prepared stepwise as \n\npreviously reported [24]. Succinctly, Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were prepared \n\nby means of mixing CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in an aqueous solution with a \n\ndexamethasone (Dex) solution with a final concentration of 5 x 10-4 M, under vigorous agitation. The \n\nmixture was then added to the precipitation media consisting of a saturated sodium carbonate (Aldrich, \n\nGermany) and acetone solution. Precipitates were collected and extensive dialysis (cellulose tubing, \n\nbenzoylated for separating compounds with a cut-off of 1,200 from (Sigma, Germany) was carried out \n\nfor 2 d. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were obtained by freezing the solution at   \n\n-80\u00baC and freeze-drying (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain).  \n\n2.3. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE HAP AND SPCL SCAFFOLDS, AND DEX-LOADED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER \n\nNANOPARTICLES \n\n2.3.1. Surface topography characterization \n\nThe surface morphology and pore size of the HAp scaffolds and SPCL scaffolds were examined under a \n\nscanning electron microscope, SEM (SM-300, Topcon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). Prior to \n\nmicrostructure analysis, specimens were sputter coated with platinum using an Ion coater (IB-3, Eiko \n\nEngineering Ltd., Ibaraki, Japan) with a current set at 6 mA, for a coating time of 2-3 min.  \n\n2.3.2. Micro-computed tomography \n\nThe qualitative and quantitative information about the microstructure of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds \n\nwas obtained by micro-computed tomography, ?-CT 20 equipment (SCANCO Medicals, Switzerland). \n\nThe X-ray scans were acquired in high resolution mode of 11 \u00b5m x/y/z [27]. Mimics\u00ae (Materialise, \n\nBelgium) was used as image processing software for CT reconstruction to create and visualize the 3-D \n\nrepresentations. \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

Transmission electron microscopy \n\nThe morphology of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was investigated by \n\ntransmission electron microscopy, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The Netherlands, equipped with \n\na MEGA VIEW-II DOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT DOCU). The nanoparticles were \n\nstained with 2% of phosphotungstic acid and placed on copper grids for observation. \n\n2.4. IN VITRO CELL CULTURE STUDIES \n\n2.4.1. Isolation and culturing of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs)  \n\nSeven-week-old Fischer 344/N male rats were purchased from Japan SLC Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan) and \n\nsacrificed in accordance with the Ethics Committee at the Tissue Engineering Research Center \n\n(Amagasaki, Japan). The epiphyseal regions of the femora were removed and marrow plugs in the \n\nfemoral shafts were flushed out using Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (MEM, Nacalai Tesque, \n\nJapan) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, FBS (JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% antibiotic-\n\nantimycotic (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution. The RBMSCs isolation was performed under aseptic \n\nconditions. RBMSCs were transferred to a T75 cm2 culture flask and expanded in the presence of \n\ncomplete MEM medium at 37\u00baC in a 5% CO2 incubator. Then, the culture medium was changed every 2 \n\nor 3 d. After reaching confluency, the cells (passage 1, P1) were released from substratum with 1 mL of \n\n0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 min. A cell suspension \n\nwas prepared and cell concentration determined using an automatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex \n\nF-520, Japan).  \n\nViability of the RBMSCs was also analyzed with a NucleoCounter (ChemoMetec A/S, Denmark) as \n\ndescribed elsewhere [33].  \n\n2.4.2. Cytotoxicity screening of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds  \n\nA luminescent cell viability assay [24] based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was \n\nperformed in order to evaluate the viability of RBMSCs seeded onto the surface of the HAp and SPCL \n\nscaffolds. Prior to RBMSCs seeding, the HAp and SPCL scaffolds were pretreated (de-airation) to \n\nprevent air bubble formation in the pores. Scaffolds were placed in 10 mL polystyrene tubes with \n\nventilation caps. MEM medium was added and scaffolds were de-aired under vacuum using a 20 mL \n\nsyringe with an attached 21G needle. Then, each scaffold was transferred into the respective well of a \n\nnon-adherent 96-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plate. RBMSCs (P1) were seeded onto the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

After each time period, the ATP content which signals the presence of metabolically \n\nactive cells was measured by means of performing a CellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay \n\n(Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was measured in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx \n\n1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA), following the protocol provided by the supplier. \n\nAll experiments were carried out 3 times using 3 replicates per experimental condition.  \n\n2.4.3. Assessment of proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs seeded onto the surface of \n\nthe HAp and SPCL scaffolds and cultured with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nRBMSCs were isolated and expanded as mentioned above. HAp and SPCL scaffolds were placed in \n\neach well of a 96-well TCPS plate. Then, 1 x 106 RBMSCs (P1) were added per each HAp and SPCL \n\nscaffold, and the constructs were cultured in complete MEM medium under standard culture conditions \n\nfor the period of 12 hrs to allow cell adhesion. After that time, cell-scaffold constructs were transferred to \n\na non-treated and non-protein coated flat bottom 12-well TCPS plate (Nunc, Japan), the different culture \n\nmedium was added, and RBMSCs were cultured for times up to 14 d. RBMSCs were exposed to a \n\nMEM medium supplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, \n\n0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA). \n\nRBMSCS were also cultured in a complete MEM medium (negative control for osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation). A complete MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 \n\nmM ?-glycerophosphate was used as the positive control for osteogenic differentiation. All experiments \n\nwere carried out 3 times using a minimum of 3 replicates per experimental condition.  \n\n2.4.4. LIVE/DEAD viability assay \n\nCell adhesion and proliferation was also investigated with a LIVE/DEAD viability assay kit (Molecular \n\nProbes, USA) after 14 d of culturing. RBMSCs-scaffold constructs were incubated with two probes, \n\ncalcein-AM (green colour) and ethidium homodimer-1 (bright red colour), for intracellular esterase \n\nactivity and plasma membrane integrity, respectively [34]. Then, RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens \n\nwere washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution and observed under a 3-D fluorescence microscope \n\n(Olympus SZX12 stereomicroscope, OLYMPUS Co. Ltd., Japan). RBMSCs-scaffold constructs \n\nspecimens were also prepared for SEM observation using standard fixative and dehydration methods.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

DNA quantification \n\nDNA quantification was performed using the nuclear dye Hoechst 33258 (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) \n\naccording to the method previously described [34]. Prior to the assay, the RBMSCs-scaffold constructs \n\nwere washed with a Ca and Mg-free PBS solution. Then, constructs were transferred to a 2 mL \n\neppendorf, pulverized with zirconia\u2019s balls (milling time of ~2 min at 25 shakes.s-1) using a ball mixer mill \n\n(Retsch GmbH, Germany), and sonicated in 0.2% Triton-X (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution for 5 min. \n\nFinally, the samples were sonicated and the DNA quantification carried out. The standard DNA solutions \n\nwere prepared using salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen, USA). \n\n2.4.6. Qualitative analysis of mineralization \n\nAlizarin red S staining was performed to investigate possible calcium deposition after 14 d of culturing. \n\nRBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were washed twice with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution and cells \n\nfixed with 95% ethanol for 15 min [35]. The fixed cells were then washed once with PBS and stained with \n\n5 mg.mL-1 Alizarin red S in Ca and Mg-free PBS solution for 5 min at room temperature. After a washing \n\nstep with ultra-pure water, RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were examined under a 3-D \n\nfluorescence microscope. \n\n2.4.7. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)  \n\nALP activity was investigated either, qualitatively and quantitatively in order to evaluate osteoblastic \n\ndifferentiation. For the ALP staining the RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were washed twice with \n\nPBS, after 14 d of culturing. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/Ca and Mg-free PBS solution \n\nfor 15 min at 4?C. The RBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were washed twice with AMP buffer (56 \n\nmM of 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol in ultra-pure water, pH 9.9) and then soaked with staining \n\nsolution 0.5 mg naphtol AS-MX phosphate and 0.5 mg fast red violet LB salt per mL, in AMP buffer. \n\nRBMSCs-scaffold construct specimens were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, washed with Ca \n\nand Mg-free PBS solution and examined under a 3-D fluorescence microscope.  \n\nThe remaining sonicated suspensions obtained from the DNA quantification assay were used to \n\ndetermine ALP levels. Prior to analysis the samples were sonicated once and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm \n\nfor 1 min at 4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl \n\nphosphate substrate (ZYMED\u00ae Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA), following the method described \n\nelsewhere [33] with minor modifications.

The supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE healthcare, Sweden) for \n\nde-salting, and concentrated in order to carry out the ELISA assay. A Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N?

MORPHOLOGY OF THE HAP AND SPCL SCAFFOLDS, AND DEX-LOADED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER \n\nNANOPARTICLES \n\nIt is well known that the ability of a scaffold to support cells proliferation and differentiation is one of the \n\nkey issues for the success of a tissue engineered cells-scaffold construct. In the current work, an \n\nextensive in vitro study was carried out in order to investigate the effect of the intracellular delivery of \n\ndexamethasone by the carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM) nanoparticles supplemented from a culture medium on the proliferation and osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of RBMSCs when cultured onto the surface of two types of scaffolds. From Figure 1, it is \n\npossible to observe the microstructure of the HAp (A-B) and SPCL (C-D) scaffolds examined under \n\nSEM. Figures 1A-B revealed that the architecture of the obtained HAp scaffolds possess a trabeculae-\n\nlike structure and highly interconnected macropores. Figures 1C-D show the typical SPCL \n\nmacroporosity, which can be obtained by randomly assembling the fibres. The polymeric scaffolds also \n\nexhibited a high level of interconnectivity. \n\nSeveral groups [27,29,31] have shown that these scaffolds exhibit adequate porosity and mechanical \n\nproperties to support cell adhesion and proliferation and  tissue ingrowth upon implantation of the \n\nconstruct. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that these starch-based scaffolds are biodegradable, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

SEM micrographs of the HAp (A-B) and SPCL (C-D) scaffolds. \n\nFigure 2 shows the 3-D micro-computed tomography images of the HAp and SPCL scaffolds. This study \n\nrevealed that the HAp scaffolds possess a mean porosity of 67.8 \u00b1 5.1% and pore size in the range of \n\n50-600 ?m. The SPCL scaffolds showed a mean porosity of 67.4 \u00b1 1.3% and pore size in the range of \n\n50-1000 ?m. The selected scaffolds present a similar porosity and pore size as well as high levels of \n\ninterconnectivity, which is ideal for carrying out a comparative study in terms of scaffold composition as \n\nthese features play a critical role in bone formation in vitro and in vivo [36]. Issues that will not be \n\naddressed in the present work are of course related to the mechanical properties and degradation rate \n\nof the scaffolds, but more details on this can be found elsewhere [31]. \n\nFigure 3 shows the TEM image of the developed Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. \n\nIt can be seen that the novel macromolecular nanocarriers possess a dendron-like morphology. These \n\nhave been shown to be effective in the loading and controlled release of Dex [24].

RAT BONE MARROW STROMAL CELLS VIABILITY, ADHESION AND PROLIFERATION \n\nA luminescent cell viability assay based on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was performed \n\nto evaluate the viability of RBMSCs seeded at different cell densities onto the surface of the HAp and \n\nSPCL scaffolds, and results are disclosed in Figure 4.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Cell numbers correlate with luminescence.  \n\nResults expressed as an average \u00b1 standard deviation, n=9. \n\nThis assay is a feasible test for assessing the cytotoxicity of materials, since it signals the presence of \n\nmetabolically active cells. Results have shown that the HAp and SPCL materials are not cytotoxic over \n\nRBMSCs. As seen in the present work, no significant differences in the RBMSCs viability were observed \n\nwhen culturing on the surface of the HAp as compared to the SPCL scaffolds. By its turn, it is possible \n\nto observe that the initial RBMSCs seeding density affects the viability (ATP content) of RBMSCs.  \n\nAdditional studies were carried out to evaluate the capacity of HAp and SPCL scaffolds to support the \n\nproliferation and differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) after exposure to Dex-\n\nloaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. In the present paper, RBMSCs proliferation was \n\ninvestigated by DNA quantification (Figure 5). From that figure it is possible to observe that the cell \n\nseeding efficiency is similar for HAp and SPCL scaffolds as observed by the DNA content after 12 hrs of \n\nculturing.

Then, RBMSCs-scaffold constructs were also examined under microscopic analyses in order to \n\nassess cell adhesion and proliferation, after 14 d of culturing (Figure 6).

The osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells cultured with dexamethasone-loaded \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles \n\n \n\n \n \n- 300 - \n \n\nAt 14 d, it was possible to observe a higher calcium deposition in the RBMSCs-scaffold constructs \n\nexposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles as compared to that of RBMSCs-\n\nscaffold constructs cultured in the standard culture medium (Figures 7I, K, and E, G). The extent of \n\nmineralization in cultures exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a final \n\nconcentration of 0.01 mg.mL-1 was of the same magnitude as for cultures exposed to a standard \n\nosteogenic media (Figures 7I, K and M, O). Moreover, from SEM images it is possible to observe the \n\ntypical mineralized nodules (Figures 7J, L and N, P), which are not seen in RBMSCs-scaffold constructs \n\ncultured in complete MEM medium (Figures 7F, H).  \n\nFinally, the osteoblastic phenotype expression levels were evaluated both, qualitatively and \n\nquantitatively for alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin, which are known to be the early and late \n\nmarkers of osteogenic differentiation [43], respectively. It is well known that Dex triggers the osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of MSCs at an early stage and directs the cells toward terminal maturation at the late \n\nstages of differentiation and matrix mineralization [44]. Thus, we hypothesized that the continuous \n\nexposure of RBMSCs to Dex via the sustained release from the nanoparticles, either intracellularly or in \n\nculture media results in the differentiation of RBMSCs into mature osteoblasts. Figure 8 shows the ALP \n\nstaining of RBMSCs-scaffold constructs after culturing in a different culture medium for a period of 14 d. \n\nAs seen for mineralization, the ALP activity is higher for cultures in which RBMSCs were exposed to \n\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and osteogenic medium (Figures 8E, F and G, H). \n\nThese findings demonstrate strong evidence that osteogenic differentiation only occured in cultures with \n\nDex either, supplemented from culture media and delivered via the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles.  \n\nThe ALP activity per DNA content of the HAp (top) and SPCL (bottom) scaffolds seeded with RBMSCs \n\nand cultured in different culture media for a period of 12 hrs, 7 and 14 d is presented in Figure 9. It is \n\npossible to observe that ALP activity is increased in cultures where RBMSCs-scaffold constructs were \n\nexposed to Dex, i.e. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, and osteogenic medium. The \n\npresent data is not surprising, since the in vitro release studies of Dex from the CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles [24] revealed that Dex concentration resembles to that of osteogenic media. In \n\naddition, a significant increase in the ALP activity of RBMSCs-HAp scaffold constructs that were \n\ncultured with Dex delivered via the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was observed as compared \n\nto the constructs supplemented with Dex in culture media, after 7 d. In contrast, the ALP activity is \n\nhigher when RBMSCs are cultured with 10-8 M Dex supplied from culture medium (Figure 9 bottom, F), \n\nafter 14 d.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

We \n\nhave also observed that ALP activity is higher for the RBMSCs-HAp constructs as compared to that for \n\nthe RBMSCs-SPCL constructs.

The osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells cultured with dexamethasone-loaded \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles \n\n \n \n\n- 303 - \n \n\nIn its turn, this data corroborates previous works [27,42,45] that demonstrated the important role of HAp in \n\nthe adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of the RBMSCs, in vitro and in vivo. This data \n\nis not surprising since HAp which has a crystal structure similar to that of bone mineral [46], and is \n\nconsidered the \u2018gold-standard\u2019 of the osteoconductive materials. The obtained results also \n\ndemonstrated that SPCL scaffolds are effective in supporting the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs, \n\nsince ALP activity is in the same order of magnitude to that of RBMSCs-HAp constructs. On the other \n\nhand, the SPCL scaffolds has been shown [31] to be degraded enzymatically, which allows an increase \n\nin the scaffold porosity over time and consequently may favour tissue ingrowth during implantation time. \n\nFigure 10 shows the content of the late osteogenic marker and bone-specific osteocalcin normalized by \n\nDNA content of RBMSCs cultured onto the surface of the HAp (top) and SPCL (bottom) scaffolds and \n\nexposed to a different culture medium for the period of 12 hrs, 7 and 14 d.  \n\nThis data corroborates the previous ALP assay demonstrating that RBMSCs differentiate into \n\nosteoblasts when culturing in the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and \n\nosteogenic medium. However, no significant differences in osteocalcin content were observed for the \n\nRBMSCs-HAp and RBMSCs-SPCL scaffold constructs supplemented with Dex delivered via the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and free in culture media, after 7 and 14 d of culturing. In the \n\nlight of these results, we have shown that RBMSCs proliferated well, and both differentiate into \n\nosteoblasts and organize into a mineralized matrix by combining Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles and scaffolds (3-D systems), in vitro.  \n\nThis work has demonstrated the efficacy of the system Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles and scaffolds in promoting the proliferation and osteodifferentiation of RBMSCs, and the \n\nsuccess in the intracellular delivery of Dex, in vitro. Thus, it is conceivable that intracellular controlled \n\ndrug delivery using biodegradable nanocarriers or cell-based carrying nanoparticles strategies may be \n\nan excellent candidate for in vivo TE applications, as these nanosystems may possibly to: (i) reduce the \n\ndrug dosage needs and, (ii) improve efficacy, since the drug would only concentrate in the \n\ndamaged/diseased cells and tissues. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.

In this work, we have \n\ninvestigated if the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles could play a crucial role in the \n\nregulation of osteogenesis, in vivo. Macroporous hydroxylapatite (HAp) scaffolds were seeded with rat \n\nbone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs), whose cells were expanded in MEM medium supplemented with \n\n0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and implanted subcutaneously on \n\nthe back of rats for the period of 2 and 4 weeks. HAp porous ceramics without RBMSCs and \n\nRBMSCs/HAp scaffold constructs seeded with cells expanded in the presence and absence of 10-8 M \n\nDex were used as controls. The effect of initial cell number seeded in the HAp scaffolds on the bone \n\nforming ability of the constructs was also investigated. Qualitative and quantitative new bone formation \n\nwas evaluated using micro-computed tomography analysis of the implants, Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin \n\nstaining of the implant sections and histomorphometrical analysis. Toluidine blue staining was also \n\ncarried out to investigate the synthesis of proteoglycan extracellular matrix. In addition, alkaline \n\nphosphatase and osteocalcin levels were quantified, since these markers denote osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation. At four-weeks post-implantation results have shown that the novel Dex-loaded \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles may be beneficial as intracellular \n\nnanocarrier, supplying Dex in a regimented manner leading to superior ectopic de novo bone formation. \n\nThe superior role of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in enhancing new bone \n\nformation was particularly evident when seeding 2 x 105 RBMSCs per HAp scaffold. \n\n \n\n \n\nThis chapter is based on the following publication: Oliveira JM, Kotobuki N, Tadokoro M, Hirose M, Mano \n\nJF, Reis RL and Ohgushi H, Ex vivo culturing of rat bone marrow stromal cells with dexamethasone-\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

INTRODUCTION \n\nA variety of hydroxylapatite (HAp) ceramics with controlled architectures [1-3] has been developed for find \n\napplications as bone substitutes in clinic. Despite, their interesting architecture namely pore size, shape \n\nand interconnectivity, mechanical properties and important biological role in the in vivo performance, \n\nthese porous implants lack on their osteoinductive capacity [4-6]. In this regard, it has been shown that \n\nporous HAp ceramics alone, do not induce bone formation in soft tissues when implanted in rabbits [7], \n\nor upon subcutaneous implantation in mice [8,9], rats [10-12] and goats [13]. By its turn, bone marrow \n\nstromal cells (BMSCs) have shown to inherently possess a huge therapeutic potential [14-20]. Therefore, \n\nin bone tissue engineering strategies, combination of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) with porous \n\nscaffolds [10,11,13,21] and use of bioreactors [22,23], have been widely explored as possible alternatives. On \n\nthe other hand, it has been shown that glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (Dex) has an essential \n\nrole for osteoblast differentiation and matrix mineralization [24-26]. In fact, it has been reported that Dex \n\nregulation depends on the degree of cellular differentiation, the donor species, and dosage, dose \n\nduration and dosing regimen [27]. Several authors [9,10,28] reported that stem cells need to be under the \n\ninfluence of such type of osteogenic factors for superior de novo bone formation. Actually, cell-scaffold \n\nconstructs showed bone formation within the pores of the scaffolds when constructs were in vitro \n\ncultured under osteogenic factors post-implantation [10,11]. However, the long culturing time is a major \n\ndrawback of this strategy and may not be the most feasible for satisfactorily meet clinical demands. In \n\naddition, we foresee that cells may not maintain in vivo the cellular phenotype upon withdrawal of Dex, \n\nsince Dex acts at both early and late stages to direct proliferative osteoprogenitor cells toward terminal \n\nmaturation [29]. Therefore, a great deal of attention has been paid for finding alternative approaches to \n\nimprove the limited cell-derived osteogenesis. In this context, we have been hypothesizing that the      \n\nex vivo culturing of stem cells with functional nanoparticles which can be efficiently taken up by cells \n\nmay influence their cellular fate in the absence of typical osteogenic inducers, in vivo. It has been shown  \n\nthat glucocorticoids such as Dex bind to and triggers the cytoplasmatic glucocorticoid receptor [30,31]. \n\nThus, we expect that the culturing of stem cells in the presence of nanoparticles that release Dex from \n\ninside, and in a regimented manner may be an effective strategy for in vivo control of stem cells \n\nosteogenic differentiation and maturation. In this regard, we have surface engineered low generation \n\npoly(amidoamine) dendrimers with carboxymethylchitosan, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nand loaded them with Dex [32]. These are expected to possess high payload, and improved \n\nbiocompatibility when compared to that of typical dendrimers. The use of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX. Ex vivo culturing of rat bone marrow stromal cells with dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles enhances ectopic bone formation on tissue engineered constructs \n\n \n\n \n \n- 314 - \n \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles can also allow avoid the need and frequency of drug administration since Dex \n\nis available at the target site, and thus possibly minimize the undesired side-effects [31].  \n\nIn previous in vitro studies [32,33], we have shown the high efficiency of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles on being internalized by different cell types. The Dex release profile from the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles was monitored, in the presence and absence of serum proteins at \n\nphysiological pH. This study has shown that Dex is released as free drug in the range of concentrations \n\nsimilar to that of typical osteogenic cocktails. Complementarily, we demonstrated their role in promoting \n\nthe osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) in tissue culture polystyrene, \n\nTCPS dishes.  \n\nOur group [34] has recently developed HAp scaffolds with macroporous structure and reported that these \n\nscaffolds are biocompatible and efficiently support the adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of RBMSCs in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles, in vitro [35]. Thus, the HAp scaffolds have shown in vitro to possess suitable \n\nphysicochemical and biological properties for being used in bone tissue engineering approaches. To \n\nfurther evaluate the in vivo performance of the cell-scaffold constructs, several groups [10,11,28,36] have \n\nbeen proposing the well established ectopic implantation model in rats. This is a cost effective model [37] \n\nand allows to avoid the presence of growth factors found at the orthotopic site whose influences may \n\naffect the performances of the constructs [38]. \n\nIn the current experimental study, we investigate if the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles play a crucial role in the regulation of osteogenesis, in vivo. We therefore used \n\nRBMSCs/HAp constructs where cells were exposed to 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles during the expansion time (Figure 1, top) and assess their efficiency in \n\npromoting the osteogenic differentiation and de novo bone formation upon subcutaneous implantation \n\non the back of rats for the period of 2 and 4 weeks. HAp porous ceramics and RBMSCs/HAp constructs \n\nseeded with different cells number and cultured either, presence and absence of Dex were used as \n\ncontrols for elucidating the role of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in promoting \n\nosteogenesis. Micro-computed tomography analysis was performed to investigate new bone formation \n\nin the RBMSCs/HAp constructs. Histological studies were also carried out using Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin \n\nstaining. Histomorphometrical analysis of the implants sections was performed to quantify new bone \n\nformation. Toluidine blue staining was also performed to investigate the synthesis of proteoglycan \n\nextracellular matrix. Complementarily, osteoblastic phenotype expression levels were determined by \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. PREPARATION OF THE HYDROXYLAPATITE (HAP) SCAFFOLDS AND SYNTHESIS OF DEXAMETHASONE-LOADED \n\nCARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) DENDRIMER (DEX-LOADED CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER \n\nNANOPARTICLES)  \n\nSintered HAp scaffolds with 5 mm diameter and 4 mm height were obtained by means of impregnating a \n\npolyurethane (PU, Eurospuma S.A., Portugal) sponge with HAp powders, as previously reported [34,41,42]. \n\nCarboxymethylchitosan was synthesized by a chemical modification route of chitin (Sigma, Germany) as \n\ndescribed by Chen et al. [43]. Starburst\u00ae poly(amidoamine)-carboxylic terminated dendrimers,     \n\nPAMAM-CT (generation 1.5, 20% (w/v) methanolic solution) with an ethylenediamine core were \n\npurchased from Aldrich (Germany). Dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles (Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM) were prepared in a stepwise manner as \n\ndescribed elsewhere [32].  \n\nPrior to the in vitro cell culture the HAp scaffolds and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles were sterilized under an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere.  \n\n2.2. IN VITRO CELL CULTURE \n\n2.2.1. Isolation and expansion of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs)  \n\nSeven-week-old Fischer 344/N male rats (Japan SLC Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) were sacrificed by \n\nadministrating an excess of anesthesia, in accordance to the Ethics Committee at the Tissue \n\nEngineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). The marrow plugs in the femoral shafts were flush \n\nout using Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (MEM, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) supplemented with 15% \n\nfetal bovine serum (FBS, JRH Biosciences, USA) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (A/B, Nacalai Tesque, \n\nJapan) solution, as previously reported [44]. RBMSCs were transferred to T75 cm2 culture flask and \n\nexpanded in the presence of different culture medium: complete MEM medium, MEM medium \n\nsupplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and  MEM \n\nmedium supplemented with 10-8 M dexamethasone at 37\u00baC in a 5% CO2 incubator. The culture medium \n\nwas changed within 3 days to remove non-adherent cells. Then, culture medium was changed each 2 or \n\n3 days. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

Seeding of RBMSCs onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds \n\nThe RBMSCs (passage 1, P1) were released from substratum with 1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM \n\nEDTA (Invitrogen, USA) and centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 minutes, after reach confluence. The \n\nsupernatant was aspirated and cells re-suspended with 10 mL of complete culture medium. Cell \n\nconcentration was determined using an automatic cell counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, Japan). \n\nPrior seeding, the viability of the RBMSCs was also analyzed with a NucleoCounter (ChemoMetec A/S, \n\nDenmark) [45]. In addition, the HAp scaffolds were de-aired in MEM medium under vacuum [35]. Then, \n\none scaffold was placed in a well of a 96-well TCPS plate and RBMSCs seeded in a drop-wise manner. \n\nRBMSCs expanded in complete MEM medium, MEM medium supplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-\n\nloaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and MEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M \n\ndexamethasone were seeded onto each HAp scaffold. The effect of cell density was evaluated by \n\nseeding different cell numbers (1 x 106 and 2 x 105) onto the HAp scaffolds. Finally, RBMSCs/HAp \n\nscaffolds constructs were cultured in complete MEM medium under standard culture conditions to allow \n\ncell adhesion, for the period of 12 hours.  \n\n2.3. IN VIVO STUDY \n\n2.3.1. Subcutaneous implantation \n\nSeven-week-old male Fisher 344 rat (Syngeneic F344/N rat), same as donor sub-strain and age, were \n\nanesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Nembutal, Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., \n\nJapan) at a final concentration of 3.5 mg per 100 g of body weight. The hair of the rat was cut at the \n\nimplantation area, followed by washing with tap water and scrubbed with tincture of iodine and 70% \n\nethanol. In each rat, three or four skin incisions (each 1 cm length) on the dorsal midline below the ear \n\nwere made. Each RBMSCs/HAp construct was implanted subcutaneously (1.5 to 2 cm away from the \n\nmidline at both right and left sides) into the respective pocket and skin sutured. As a negative control, \n\nwe used HAp implants without RBMSCs. No prophylactic medication was administered post-surgery.  \n\nAfter 2 and 4 weeks implantation, the animals were sacrificed with an overdose of anesthetic and the \n\nimplants retrieved. All experiments were carried out 3 times. \n\n2.3.2. Micro-computed tomography analysis \n\nNew bone formation in the retrieved implants was investigated by micro-computed tomography analysis \n\n(?-CT: MCT-CB 100MF(Z); Hitachi Medical Corp., Tokyo, Japan). After 2 and 4 weeks of implantation, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

X-ray scans were acquired with \n\na resolution mode of 10 \u00b5m (x/y/z) at 50 kV and 150 ?A. The analytical conditions were: precision \n\nmode, 7 times magnification with an image intensifier field of 4.57 cm [46]. CT reconstruction has carried \n\nout using the 3-D Bone Morphometry (TRI/3D-Bon, RATOC System Engineering Co. Ltd., Tokyo, \n\nJapan) software for evaluate the 2-D distribution of newly formed bone within the pores of the explants.  \n\n2.3.3. Histological evaluation of the explants \n\nAfter ?-CT, implants were decalcified with K-CX solution (Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for histological \n\nanalysis. Firstly, the constructs were dehydrated in an ascending series grade ethanol/water solution \n\n(from 90-100%) using an automatic machine for 19 hours followed by washing three times with xylene. \n\nThen, specimens were immersed in paraffin at 62\u00baC and allowed to solidify at -5\u00baC. Slides were \n\nprepared by cutting the specimens into sections 5 ?m thick using a microtome, and mounted in a micro-\n\nslide glass (Matsunami glass Ind. Ltd., Japan). Paraffin was melt by placing the slides in the oven at \n\n71\u00baC for 20 minutes and allowed to let cool down at room temperature. The remnant paraffin was then \n\neliminated off in hexane for 5 minutes (S.T. Chemical, Japan), followed by dipping into a \n\nethylene/propylene mixture (Clear Plus, Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 3 minutes. Then, slides were \n\nimmersed three times in 100% ethanol for 2 minutes each time of immersion.   \n\nFor the Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) staining, slides were sequentially transferred to a 90% ethanol and \n\nthen to a 70% and washed with tap water. It followed the staining step, which consisted in the \n\nimmersion of the slides into the GM\u2019s Haematoxylin dye (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan, \n\nGM Haematoxylin Staining for H&amp;E staining N\u00ba 3008-1) for 10 minutes. It followed the washing step with \n\ntap water for 5 to 10 minutes. Then, slides were rinsed with de-ionized water and immersed in a 70% \n\nethanol solution. Finally, slides were immersed in Eosin dye (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd, Tokyo, \n\nJapan N\u00ba 3204-2) solution for 2 minutes and dehydrated in a series of ethanol grades (70%, 90%, and \n\n100%). At last were immersed three times in an ethylene/propylene mixture and then mounted avoiding \n\nthe formation of bubbles for observation. \n\nFor Toluidine blue staining, paraffin was melt and slides rinsed with ultrapure water. The ground \n\nsections were stained with 0.05% toluidine blue (Muto Pure Chemicals Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) for       \n\n30 minutes. Finally, the slides were dehydrated in a series of ethanol grades (70%, 90%, and 100%) \n\nand mounted for further observation. All slides were examined under a light microscope (Olympus \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

Ltd, Japan). 2-D histological sections are given for the same bone specimens used \n\nin the micro-computed tomography analysis. \n\n2.3.4. Histomorphometry \n\nHistomorphometrical analysis was carried out using the public domain image-processing program \n\nIMAGE J (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to obtain quantitative evaluation of histological \n\nsection of bone. The  light microscopy photographs of the 2-D histological decalcified sections of each \n\nsample were converted to gray-value images and several filter steps were performed [47]. Shrinkage \n\npercentage observed in decalcified sections [46] was not considered in the calculations. New bone \n\nformation (NB) was expressed as a percentage of bone volume density (BV/TSV, Bone volume/Tissue \n\nplus Scaffold volume) \u00b1 standard deviation. A minimum of 12 sections per implant were analyzed. \n\n2.3.5. Quantification of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)  \n\nAlkaline phosphatase was measured to evaluate osteoblast differentiation. Prior to the assay, the \n\nexplants were washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution. Then, implants were transferred to a 2 mL \n\neppendorf and pulverized with zirconia\u2019s balls as previously reported [35]. Prior to analysis the samples \n\nwere sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute at 4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was \n\nadded an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate substrate (ZYMED\u00ae Laboratories, \n\nInvitrogen, USA) [46]. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 30 minutes at 37\u00baC and after that time \n\nthe reaction was stopped with 1 M NaOH (Panreac, Japan). Standards were prepared with                   \n\np-nytrophenol, pNP. Triplicates were made for each sample and standard. Absorbance was read at 405 \n\nnm (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, USA), and sample \n\nconcentrations were read off from the standard graph. Enzyme activity was expressed either as nmol of \n\npNP released/explant/30 minutes. \n\n2.3.6. Quantification of osteocalcin \n\nThe remnant of each sample used for the ALP assay was treated with a 20% formic acid solution and \n\nstored at 4?C for 2-3 days. Afterwards samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4?C. \n\nThen, the supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE healthcare, Sweden), \n\nsubsequently concentrated for performing the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A Rat \n\nOsteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., MA, USA) was used following the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nRecently, our group [32] has proposed the combinatorial strategy of tissue engineering principles with \n\nnanocarriers towards the intracellular release and regimented supply of Dex aimed at control the stem \n\ncells osteogenic differentiation in the absence of typical osteogenic cocktails, in vivo. In this context, we \n\nhave shown that is possible to develop CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and load these \n\nmacromolecules with Dex. The in vitro release studies have shown that Dex is released as free drug in \n\nthe range of concentrations similar to that of typical osteogenic cocktails when using concentrations of \n\nnanoparticles in the range of 0.01 mg.mL-1. Moreover, we have shown that osteogenic differentiation \n\noccurs in RBMSCs seeded onto the HAp scaffolds in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, in vitro [35]. \n\nIn the current work, we have investigated if the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\ncan allow improving in vivo bone formation. We therefore exposed RBMSCs to 0.01 mg.mL-1             \n\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles during expansion time, seeded the RBMSCs onto \n\nthe surface of the HAp scaffolds and implanted the constructs subcutaneously on the back of F344/N \n\nrats (Figure 1, top). The effect of cell number on the bone forming capacity was also investigated, since \n\nhas been shown that influences ectopic bone formation [37]. Ohgushi et al. [45] observed that fresh \n\nRBMSCs cultured in the presence of Dex and seeded onto the HAp scaffolds can show a high level of in \n\nvivo bone-forming ability. Therefore, in this study we also used as control the RBMSCs/HAp constructs, \n\nwhere RBMSCs were pre-cultured in a MEM medium with Dex at a final concentration of 10-8 M. We \n\npreliminary assessed histologically, new bone formation on the RBMSCs/HAp constructs, after 2 weeks \n\nof subcutaneous implantation. At 2 weeks post-implantation no bone formation was detected in the \n\nRBMSCs/HAp constructs with RBMSCs expanded in complete MEM medium, MEM medium \n\nsupplemented with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and MEM \n\nmedium supplemented with 10-8 M dexamethasone and HAp  scaffolds without cells (data not shown). \n\nTherefore, to observe the effect of pre-culturing RBMSCs in the presence of Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in the de novo bone formation, we implanted subcutaneously \n\nthe RBMSCs/HAp constructs for 4 weeks.  \n\nFigure 1 (bottom) shows the photograph of the RBMSCs/HAp construct in the back of the F344/N rats, \n\nwhere RBMSCs were pre-incubated with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

In fact, it is also possible to \n\nobserve the lacunar spaces and reminiscent osteocyte-like cells entrapped in the bone matrix (see \n\nFigures 3H, J and L). Thus, osteocytic lacunae in the lamellar bone are uniform and regularly distributed \n\nwith osteoblasts forming a continuous layer of bone in a unidirectional way typical of mature bone (NB). \n\nIn addition, we also detect new bone formation in the HAp scaffolds seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs that \n\nwere previously expanded in the presence of 10-8 M Dex (Figures 3G-H) and 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (Figures 3K-L). In the late, we can observe a higher new bone \n\nformation as compared to that of constructs seeded with RBMSCs that were expanded in the presence \n\nof 10-8 M (Figures 3G-H). This data thus confirm the \u00b5-CT observations in Figure 2, which showed that \n\nthe gray areas are in fact newly formed bone. From Figures 3A-B it can be seen that fibrovascular tissue \n\n(F) with fat cells was formed and there is no evidence of de novo bone formation within the scaffolds. No \n\nbone formation was also observed for the RBMSCs/HAp constructs seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs that \n\nwere expanded in MEM medium (Figures 3C-D), thus once corroborating the \u00b5-CT findings. Despite, \n\nthis data shows the importance of the porous size and interpore connectivity on the cells in-growth since \n\nfibrovascular tissue can be seen in the core of the scaffolds. Moreover, we can also observe that bone \n\nformation in the implants seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs expanded in the presence of 10-8 M Dex for 7 \n\ndays, is restricted to the walls of the HAp scaffolds (Figure 3I). In addition, it can also be seen extensive \n\nformation of adipocytes (A) in inner part of the pores of the implants. This result is not surprisingly since \n\nPorter et al. [29] have shown that the sustained exposure of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to Dex \n\ninduce the maturation of an adipocyte subpopulation within BMSCs, in vitro. Actually, in their studies \n\nthey proposed that these side effects can be reduced if Dex is supplied in a regimented manner. In fact \n\nthis hypothesis is supported by our histological findings, since we can detect that the pores of the \n\nRBMSCs/HAp constructs, where cells were pre-cultured with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles are completely filled with calcified bone like-matrix (Figure 3M), and the presence of \n\nadipocytes is decreased. Thus this data supports the idea that the supply of Dex in a regimented \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

Ex vivo culturing of rat bone marrow stromal cells with dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles enhances ectopic bone formation on tissue engineered constructs \n\n \n\n \n \n- 324 - \n \n\nSeveral authors [8,10,48,49] have been considering that degradation rate, pore geometry and degree of \n\ninterconnectivity are important features for successfully induce de novo bone formation, since they \n\ncontrol the diffusion of oxygen, nutrients and metabolites to and from the cells. Therefore, the developed \n\nHAp scaffolds should own an adequate pore size and interconnectivity, since extensive new bone \n\nformation within the macropores was observed. From 2-D \u00b5-CT images and histological findings we \n\nobserve that new bone was connected at the interpores (Figures 2 and 3). It has been shown that the \n\ninterpore connections below 3 \u00b5m do not allow cell migration and vascularization [50]. Actually, we may \n\nobserve bone formation in the core (osteoconduction) of the HAp scaffolds which reveals that the \n\nscaffolds posses an adequate interpore size and connection.  \n\nFigure 4 shows a representative light microscopy photograph of a decalcified section (H&amp;E staining) of \n\nHAp scaffolds seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs which were expanded in MEM medium supplemented with \n\n0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, after 4 weeks of subcutaneous \n\nimplantation, and the respective imaging processing that was carried out to perform the \n\nhistomorphometrical analyses.   \n\n \n\nFigure 4.

Results have shown that no bone \n\nformation was observed in the HAp scaffolds without RBMSCs and HAp seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs \n\nexpanded in MEM medium. Bone volume density in HAp seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs expanded in \n\nMEM medium was 27.1 \u00b1 7.1%. By its turn, HAp seeded with 2 x 105 and 1 x 106 RBMSCs expanded in \n\nMEM medium supplemented with 10-8 M Dex was 6.9 \u00b1 4.7% and 36.4 \u00b1 9.2%, respectively.

This data shows that porous HAp ceramics alone do not induce bone formation upon \n\nsubcutaneous implantation in the back of the F344/N rats. However by seeding bone marrow stromal \n\ncells (BMSCs) onto the scaffolds bone formation could be detected, when cell number was 1 x 106 cells.  \n\nTable 1.

This is \n\nparticularly evident when seeding low cell numbers onto the surface of the HAp scaffolds. Thus these \n\nfindings demonstrate that Dex was available inside the RBMSCs and could be release from the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles with an adequate profile. Our present data is relevant if we \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

[10] have demonstrated bone formation in the RBMSCs/HAp scaffolds after 2 weeks of \n\nectopic implantation, but constructs were previously cultured in vitro in a osteogenic medium. On the \n\nother hand, Arinzeh et al. [8] observed low amounts of new bone formation in the HAp scaffolds seeded \n\nwith 5 x 106 cells, and mainly restricted to peripheral pores, after 6 weeks.  \n\nIt has been reported [29,51,52] that sustained exposure of bone marrow stromal cells to Dex down-regulate \n\ncollagen type I production in vitro both in humans and animal models. To further investigate \n\nproteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis (ECM) [37], we stained the implants sections with the \n\nmethacromatic toluidine blue (Figure 5). Methacromasia was weakly observed in implants where new \n\nbone formation was formed (Figures 5E-F, G-H, I-J, and K-L). The other implants had no such findings \n\n(Figures 5A-B, and C-D). However, enhanced methacromasia was evidenced in the RBMSCs/HAp \n\nconstructs where RBMSCs were expanded in the presence of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles (Figures 5M-N), which shows the ECM rich of proteoglycans. This data suggests that \n\nsupply of Dex in a regimented manner can enhance proteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis. No \n\ncartilaginous like-matrix [53] was observed. \n\nOsteoblast differentiation is accompanied by the differential and temporal expression of several \n\nosteoblastic markers such as ALP, osteopontin, collagen type I, and osteocalcin [39]. To demonstrate the \n\nquantitatively the osteogenic capacity of the different implants, we measured the ALP activity and \n\nosteocalcin contents, after 4 weeks of implantation. Figure 6 shows the ALP activity of the HAp scaffolds \n\nwithout RBMSCs and the several RBMSCs/HAp constructs post-implantation. As seen for bone \n\nformation, the ALP activity is higher in the HAp implants seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs as compared to \n\nthat seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs. This data thus suggests that osteogenic differentiation did occur in \n\ncultures with and without Dex which corroborates previous histological findings. It can be seen that ALP \n\nis higher when RBMSCs were expanded in a culture medium with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and 10-8 M Dex. In addition, no significant differences were \n\nobserved between the implants seeded with 1 x 106 RBMSCs where RBMSCs were expanded in a \n\nculture medium with Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and 10-8 M Dex. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

It can be seen that ALP activity in the implants where RBMSCs were expanded in a \n\nculture medium with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles presented \n\nhigher ALP levels as compared to that of culture medium with 10-8 M Dex, which is consistent with the \n\nhigher bone formation observed. In other words, our data are is in full agreement with previous findings \n\n[28,54], as we found that continuous  treatment with Dex consistently increases the ALP activity, which is \n\nan indication of the osteogenic commitment of RBMSCs. Thus, Dex induced the early osteoblastic \n\ndifferentiation and potentate new bone formation. Moreover, HAp scaffolds without RBMSCs and \n\nRBMSC/HAp constructs seeded with 2 x 105 RBMSCs expanded in MEM medium presents low ALP \n\nactivities, which demonstrates the important role of Dex and cell number on the formation of new bone.  \n\nFigure 7 shows the osteocalcin content of the RBMSCs/HAp constructs, after 4 weeks of subcutaneous \n\nimplantation.

Increasing osteocalcin expression \n\nindicated advancing differentiation. By its turn, as observed for ALP, osteocalcin content in the HAp \n\nscaffolds without cells is low, which explains the absence of bone formation. In addition, it is possible to \n\nobserve that the osteocalcin content did not vary significantly in the implants where RBMSCs were \n\nn\nm\n\no\nl/\n\ne\nx\n\np\nla\n\nn\nt/\n\n3\n0\n\n m\nin\n\nu\nte\n\ns\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.

Moreover, no significant \n\ndifferences were found in explants with RBMSCs exposed to Dex.

Results \n\nexpressed as an average \u00b1 standard deviation, n=9. \n\nIt has been shown that the expression of osteocalcin increases [56] with mineral deposition, while ALP \n\nlevels decreases [57].

Moreover, this study demonstrate that CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles could \n\nsupply Dex to RBMSCS in a regimented manner, thus acting at both early and late stages to direct \n\nproliferative osteoprogenitor cells toward terminal maturation. The superior role of the Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles in increasing the ALP levels was particularly evident when \n\nseeding 2 x 105 RBMSCs per HAp scaffold. \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS \n\nIn this work, we have demonstrated that cell number and ex vivo culturing strategies greatly influences \n\nthe osteogenesis and de novo bone formation, in vivo.

Ex vivo culturing of rat bone marrow stromal cells with dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles enhances ectopic bone formation on tissue engineered constructs \n\n \n\n \n \n- 330 - \n \n\ndexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amido-amine) dendrimer nanoparticles and seeded \n\nat low cell number on the surface of the HAp scaffolds enhanced the ectopic bone formation, after 4 \n\nweeks of subcutaneous implantation in the back of F344/N rats. This study reveals that the novel \n\ndexamethasone-carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles may be beneficial \n\nas intracellular nanocarrier and supply of Dex in a regimented manner to modulate and direct stem cells \n\ndifferentiation towards osteogenic phenotype, enhance proteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis and \n\nsuperior ectopic de novo bone formation. The architecture of HAp scaffolds proved to be a good support \n\nfor osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived osteoblast and bone formation, in vivo. Thus, the \n\ntissue engineering strategy proposed in this work showed to be effective on promoting de novo bone \n\nformation in vivo and avoid the long time of in vitro culturing in the presence of osteogenic cocktails \n\nwhich is seen as major drawback for most clinical applications.  \n\nREFERENCES \n\n1.

Biodegradable and biocompatible sphere-like \n\nnanoparticles were previously developed by means of grafting carboxymethylchitosan onto \n\npoly(amidoamine) dendrimers (CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles). Such structures have been \n\nproposed to be used in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine as an intracellular drug delivery \n\nsystem of bioactive molecules to modulate stem cells fate in vivo, namely proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation. In this work deeper studies on the physicochemical properties and morphology of the \n\nnanoparticles were carried out, including proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), transmission \n\nelectron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential analyses. Upon \n\ndexamethasone (Dex) loading into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, we have assisted to a \n\nparticle size increase, while no significant variation on the zeta potential was observed. Moreover, the \n\neffect of Dex loading on the viability of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) and internalization \n\nefficiency were also investigated by quantification of ATP and fluorescence studies, respectively. These \n\nstudies reveal that Dex did not affect cells viability, but decrease nanoparticles internalization by \n\nRBMSCs, in vitro. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles osteogenic potential and bone \n\nforming ability were also evaluated, in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies revealed that mineralization \n\noccur in 2-D RBMSCs cultures exposed to the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles to \n\nan extent similar to that for osteogenic medium. For in vivo studies, RBMSCs were incubated with Dex-\n\nloaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles during the expansion period and the cells were then \n\nseeded onto the surface of starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds before being implanted \n\nsubcutaneously into the back of Fischer 344 rats for 4 weeks. Interestingly, the \u00b5-CT and morphometric \n\nanalyses, histology (H&amp;E staining), biochemical parameters denoting osteogenesis and mineral bone \n\nformation content, demonstrate the superior performance of the developed nanoparticle system for the \n\nintracellular delivery of Dex as it stimulate RBMSCs to produce superior bone mineral in the absence of \n\nthe typical osteogenic supplements, in vivo.  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

INTRODUCTION \n\nCell and tissue engineering [1-7] has benefited from the development of novel strategies that can \n\nstimulate and control cells functions, in vitro and in vivo. This issue it is still regarded as a very \n\nappealing challenge [4,8,9] since there is the need to target-deliver biological agents, including \n\ndifferentiation factors or genetic material towards modulating from inside stem cells behavior. \n\nNanocarrier systems have generated a significant amount of interest in the ex vivo cell maintenance and \n\nco-culturing [10,11], and control of the cellular fate in vivo mainly due to their internalization efficiency, \n\ndrug loading capacity, and to favorably modulate the solubility and pharmacokinetics of drugs [12-14].  \n\nLikewise, a great deal of attention has been given [15,16] to understanding the fundamental problem of \n\nthe entry and retention mechanisms of nanoparticles on mammalian cells since the nano-devices may \n\nbe incorporated into membrane-bounded endosomes and fail to access the cytosolic cell targets.  In this \n\nregard, dendrimers have attracted growing interest as nanocarriers as they can pass through cell \n\nmembranes [17-19]. Despite the interesting architecture and multivalency, it has been found [20] that high \n\ngeneration dendrimers are often cytotoxic. The designing of dendrimers for biological and medical \n\napplications has been exploited by many researchers [21-23]; however, a fundamental paradigm still \n\nremains: how can we improve dendrimers biocompatibility without compromising their multivalency?  \n\nTo the best of our knowledge, nanoparticle systems that are biocompatible, possess higher loading \n\ncapacity, and allow the bulk incorporation of bioactive molecules of higher molecular weights and of \n\ndifferent chemistry, while maintaining high internalization and transfection efficiency as compared to \n\nconventional dendrimers still have not been successfully developed. We focused our attention in this \n\nfundamental problem, and have been proposing a novel surface engineering strategy which consists of \n\nusing a low generation dendrimer backbone grafted to the carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht), a natural \n\namphoteric polyelectrolyte derived from chitosan, with the aim of obtaining copolymers of new \n\narchitectures and physichochemical properties. We develop novel macromolecules [24] by grafting \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) onto poly(amidoamine) dendrimers, the so-called CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles. This new class of nanobiomaterials has been proposed to act intracellularly in \n\nthe control of the stem cells fate in vivo, in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. \n\nHowever, this remains \u2018proof-of-concept\u2019 with previous report [24] showing that the surface engineering of \n\nPAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles with the biodegradable CMCht possibly to manipulate the chemical \n\ncomposition and improve biocompatibility, thus avoiding the cytotoxic effects of high-generation \n\ndendrimers. Moreover, upon loading of dexamethasone (Dex), the dendron-like nanocarriers promote \n\nthe osteogenic differentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs), in vitro [24,25].  \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. Dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles induces osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells and ectopic bone formation \n\n \n\n \n \n- 340 - \n \n\nHere we report deeper studies on the physicochemical characteristics of the novel nanoparticles, \n\nnamely the influence of incorporating Dex, measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) \n\nspectroscopy. The effect of Dex loading on the architecture, Zeta potential and size of the nanoparticles \n\nwas investigated under transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a particle size analyzer. A \n\nluminescent cell viability assay based on the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) quantification was carried \n\nfor screening nanoparticles cytotoxicity over RBMSCs. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and \n\nfluorescence microscopic studies were carried out to investigate the internalization efficiency of the Dex-\n\nloaded CMCht/PAMAM dendron-like nanoparticles nanoparticles. Moreover, to further investigate on \n\ntheir osteogenic potential, in vitro and in vivo studies were performed. In vitro mineralization was \n\nevaluated by measuring the levels of calcein uptake. For in vivo studies, Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendron-like nanoparticles were exposed from culture media to RBMSCs during the expansion period. \n\nThen, RBMSCs were seeded onto the surface of starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) scaffolds overnight \n\nfollowed by subcutaneous implantation in the back of Fischer 344 rats for 4 weeks. Bone formation was \n\nevaluated by micro-computed tomography and morphometric analyses, and histological studies \n\n(Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin staining). Complementarily, biochemical analyses such as ALP activity, \n\nosteocalcin content and calcium assay were also carried out.  \n\n2. MATERIALS AND METHODS  \n\n2.1. SYNTHESIS OF THE CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN/POLY(AMIDOAMINE) (CMCHT/PAMAM) DENDRIMER \n\nNANOPARTICLES AND LOADING WITH DEXAMETHASONE (DEX)  \n\nCarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer, CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were \n\nprepared in a stepwise manner as described elsewhere [24]. A CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nsolution was mixed with dexamethasone (Dex) at final concentration of 5x10-5 M, under agitation. Dex-\n\nloaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were obtained by a precipitation route. Then, \n\nprecipitate was collected by filtration, dialyzed and freeze-dried (Telstar-Cryodos -80, Spain). \n\nFluorescent probe nanoparticles were also prepared using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) [24].  \n\n2.2. CHARACTERIZATION OF THE DEVELOPED NANOPARTICLES  \n\nThe incorporation of Dex into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles was investigated by            \n\n1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and \n\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dissolved in deuterated water, D2O (Aldrich, \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X. Dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles induces osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells and ectopic bone formation \n\n \n \n\n- 341 - \n \n\nUSA). The NMR spectra were obtained with a Mercury -400BB operating at a frequency of 399.9 MHz \n\nat 50?C. The one-dimensional 1H spectra were acquired using a 45? pulse, a spectral width of 6.3 kHz \n\nand an acquisition time of 2.001 seconds.  \n\nZeta potential and particle size of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were measured in a particle size analyzer (Zetasizer Nano ZS, \n\nMalvern Instruments, UK). For the present study, particle size analyses were performed by dynamic \n\nlight scattering (DLS), in an aqueous solution with low concentration of nanoparticles and using \n\ndisposable sizing cuvettes. Electrophoretic determinations of Zeta potential were investigated using the \n\nuniversal \u2018dip\u2019 cell, at pH 3 and pH 7.4, in a citrate buffer and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solutions, \n\nrespectively. Zeta potential was also investigated in water. \n\nThe changes on the morphology of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles after incorporation of \n\nDex was investigated under transmission electron microscopy, TEM (Philips CM-12, FEI Company, The \n\nNetherlands) equipped with a MEGA VIEW-II DOCU camera and Image Software Analyzer SIS NT \n\nDOCU, as previously described elsewhere [24].  \n\n2.3. STARCH-POLYCAPROLACTONE (SPCL) SCAFFOLDS \n\nA blend of starch and poly-?-caprolactone from Novamont (Italy) 30/70 (w/w) was used to produce fibres \n\nof starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) by melt spinning using a modular co-rotating twin screw extruder. \n\nSPCL scaffolds with 5 mm diameter and 4 mm height were obtained by fibre bonding as reported \n\nelsewhere [25,26]. More details on SPCL scaffolds can be found elsewhere [27]. Prior in vivo studies all the \n\nSPCL scaffolds were sterilized under an ethylene oxide gas atmosphere. \n\n2.4. IN VITRO STUDIES \n\n2.4.1. Luminescent viability assay \n\nRat bone marrow stromal cells (RBMSCs) were isolated from femora of 7 week-old male Fischer 344/N \n\nrats (SLC Inc. Japan), and expanded in T75 cm2 culture flasks in the presence of Eagle\u2019s minimum \n\nessential medium (MEM, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS, JRH Biosciences, \n\nUSA) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (A/B, Nacalai Tesque, Japan) solution, the so-called MEM complete \n\nmedium. Firstly, the animals were sacrificed following the protocol approved by Ethics Committee at the \n\nTissue Engineering Research Center (Amagasaki, Japan). The femora\u2019s were collected, marrow flushed \n\nout and marrow cells from each shaft were transferred into a T75 cm2 culture flask (BD Biosciences \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

The culture \n\nmedium was changed within a 3 days period to remove non-adherent cells, followed by changing the \n\nculture medium each 2 or 3 days, until reaching about 80% confluence. RBMSCs were trypsinized with \n\n1 mL of 0.05% tripsin-0.53 mM EDTA (Invitrogen, USA) solution, and incubated for 3 minutes at 37\u00baC. \n\nComplete culture medium was added and RBMSCs (passage 1, P1) were centrifuged at 900 rpm for 5 \n\nminutes. Then, supernatant was aspirated and cells re-suspended with 10 mL of complete culture \n\nmedium. Cell counting was performed using an automated counter (Cell Counter Sysmex F-520, \n\nJapan). Viability of RBMSCs was analyzed with a NucleoCounter (Chemometec, Denmark), prior \n\nseeding [28]. \n\nRBMSCs were seeded (sub-cultured) to each well of a 96-well tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) plate \n\nat a cell density of 5 x 103 cells.mL-1, as previously described elsewhere [24]. Serial dilutions (1, 0.1, and \n\n0.01 mg.mL-1) of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles were prepared using the MEM complete culture medium, and RBMSCs cultured with the \n\nrespective media for 24 and 72 hours.  A latex rubber extract was used as the positive control for \n\ncellular death. After each time period, the ATP content was measured by means of performing a \n\nCellTiter-Glo\u00ae luminescent cell viability assay (Promega Corporation, USA). Luminescence was \n\nmeasured in a microplate reader (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, \n\nUSA). All experiments were carried out in triplicate using 4 replicates per experimental condition. \n\n2.4.2. Investigation of the internalization efficiency upon incorporation of dexamethasone into the \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles  \n\nRBMSCs were isolated and expanded as described above. Then, RBMSCs were sub-cultured in a 6-\n\nwell (1 x 105 cells.well-1) and a tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) coverslips in 24-well TCPS plates (2 x \n\n104 cells.well-1) for analysis under FACS and fluorescence microscopy, respectively.  \n\nFor fluorescence microscopy, RBMSCs were cultured in a MEM complete culture medium \n\nsupplemented with the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and MEM complete \n\nculture medium with the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at a concentration of  \n\n0.1 mg.mL-1 for the period of 12 hours until 14 days. By its turn, for FACS analysis RBMSCs were \n\ncultured in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles \n\nnanoparticles, for the period of 12 hours until 14 days. All experiments were carried out in triplicate. \n\nAfter each time period, the RBMSCs were fixed with 4% formalin (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) and \n\nincubated with Texas Red?-X phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, USA) and Hoechst 33258 \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

We \n\nfollowed the protocols provided by the supplier, with few modifications. The specimens were observed \n\nunder a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX70, OLYMPUS Co. Ltd., Japan). \n\nPrior FACS analysis each well of the 6-well plate was washed with PBS and cells released from \n\nsubstratum as described above. After centrifugation at 900 rpm for 5 minutes, RBMSCs were re-\n\nsuspended in 0.5 mL of complete culture medium and passed through cell strainers [29]. Propidium \n\niodide (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) was added to each sample for determining the number of live cells. \n\nThen, RBMSCs were loaded in a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences Imunocytometry \n\nSystems, USA) and analyzed with a minimum of 10,000 events counting [24].  \n\n2.4.3. Assessment of calcein uptake (mineralization), in vitro \n\nRBMSCs were isolated from F344/N rats and expanded as described above. RBMSCs (P1) were \n\ncultured in a TCPS 24-well plate at a cell density of 2 x 104 cells.well-1 and cultured in a complete MEM \n\nmedium for 24 hours. After that time, culture medium was replaced by the different culture media, and \n\nRBMSCs cultured for times up to 14 days. The effect of the concentration of Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles on the RBMSCs osteogenic differentiation was investigated as \n\npreviously reported elsewhere [24]. Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were dissolved \n\nin MEM complete medium supplemented with 0.28 mM ascorbic acid (Wako Pure Chemicals, Japan) \n\nand 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (Sigma, USA) at a final concentration of 0.01 and 1 mg.mL-1. RBMSCs \n\nwere also cultured in a MEM complete medium (negative control for osteogenic differentiation), MEM \n\ncomplete medium containing 1 mg.mL-1 of CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles, and MEM \n\ncomplete medium containing 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate (negative controls). MEM complete medium \n\nsupplemented with 10-8 M Dex, 0.28 mM ascorbic acid and 10 mM ?-glycerophosphate was used as the \n\npositive control for osteogenic differentiation. Culture media were changed every 2-3 days.  \n\nThe degree of mineralization was qualitatively and quantitatively investigated following the method \n\ndescribed by Uchimura et al. [30]. Succinctly, the method consists on the culturing of the RBMSCs in the \n\npresence of 1 ?g.mL-1 of calcein (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan), which is incorporated in the mineralized \n\nextracellular matrix and allow us to investigate the calcium deposition.  After each time period (1, 7 and \n\n14 days), each well was washed twice with PBS after which 1 mL of PBS was added. The fluorescence \n\nof calcein incorporated into the mineralized matrices was both visualized and quantified in a image \n\nanalyzer equipment (Typhoon 8600 Variable Mode Imager, Amersham Biosciences, USA) using a 526 \n\nnm short pass filter. Afterwards, the fluorescence of the incorporated calcein was also observed under a \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

IN VIVO STUDIES \n\nRBMSCs were expanded in different culture media namely, MEM, MEM supplemented with Dex and \n\nMEM supplemented with the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. Then, the respective \n\nRBMSCs at different cell numbers (1 x 106 and 2 x 105) were seeded onto the surface of the SPCL \n\nscaffolds, cultured overnight in MEM complete medium for cell adhesion, and then constructs were \n\nimplanted subcutaneously. Seven-week-old male Fisher 344 rat (Syngeneic F344/N rat), same as donor \n\nsub-strain and age, were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (Nembutal, Dainippon \n\nPharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Japan) at a final concentration of 3.5 mg per 100 g of body weight. The hair of \n\nthe rat was cut at the implantation area, followed by washing with tap water and scrubbed with tincture \n\nof iodine and 70% ethanol. In each rat, three or four skin incisions (each 1 cm length) on the dorsal \n\nmidline below the ear were made. Each RBMSCs-SPCL constructs was implanted subcutaneously (1.5 \n\nto 2 cm away from the midline at both right and left sides) into the respective pocket and skin sutured. \n\nAs a negative control, we used SPCL implants without RBMSCs. No prophylactic medication was \n\nadministered post-surgery. After 4 weeks implantation, the animals were sacrificed with an overdose of \n\nanesthetic and RBMSCs-SPCL constructs and controls were retrieved. All experiments were carried out \n\n3 times. \n\n2.5.1. Micro-computed tomography (\u00b5-CT) and morphometric analyses \n\nNew bone formation in the explants was evaluated using micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT). \n\nMicro-CT was carried out with a high-resolution \u00b5-CT Skyscan 1072 scanner (Skyscan, Kontich, \n\nBelgium) using a resolution of pixel size of 6.59 ?m and integration time of 1.7 ms. The X-ray source \n\nwas set at 40 keV of energy and 250 ?A of current. Approximately 400 projections were acquired over a \n\nrotation range of 180\u00b0 with a rotation step of 0.45\u00b0. Data sets were reconstructed using standardized \n\ncone-beam reconstruction software (NRecon v1.4.3, SkyScan). The output format for each sample was \n\n500 serial 1024x1024 bitmap images. Representative data set of 250 slices were segmented into binary \n\nimages with a dynamic threshold of 220-255 (grey values) to assess new bone formation. The same \n\nrepresentative volume of interest (VOI) was analysed for all the samples. These data sets were used for \n\nmorphometric analysis (CT Analyser, v1.5.1.5, SkyScan) and to build the 3-D models (ANT 3-D creator, \n\nv2.4, SkyScan). The morphometric analysis included scaffold characterization such as porosity and \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

The distribution of this new bone \n\nformation in the scaffolds was assessed by 3-D virtual models that were created, visualized and \n\nregistered using both image processing software\u2019s (CT Analyser and ANT 3-D creator).  \n\n2.5.2. Histological studies \n\nAfter ?-CT analysis, the explants were decalcified with K-CX solution (Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for \n\nhistological analysis. Firstly, the explants were dehydrated in an ascending series grade ethanol/water \n\nsolution (from 90-100%) for 19 hours followed by washing three times with xylene. Then, explants were \n\nimmersed in paraffin at 62\u00baC and allowed to solidify at -5\u00baC. Slides were prepared by cutting the \n\nexplants into sections 5 ?m thick using a microtome, and mounted in a micro-slide glass (Matsunami \n\nglass Ind. Ltd., Japan). Paraffin was melt by placing the slides in the oven at 71\u00baC for 20 minutes and \n\nallowed to let cool down at room temperature. The remnant paraffin was then subsequently removed \n\nfrom slides by immersion in hexane for 5 minutes (S.T. Chemical, Japan), and in a ethylene/propylene \n\nmixture (Clear Plus, Falma Co., Tokyo, Japan) for 3 minutes. Then, slides were immersed three times in \n\n100% ethanol for 2 minutes each time of immersion.   \n\nFor the Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin (H&amp;E) staining, slides were sequentially transferred to a 90% ethanol and \n\nthen to a 70% and washed with tap water. It followed the staining steps and mounted for observation as \n\ndescribed elsewhere [31]. \n\n2.5.3. Analyses of biochemical parameters \n\nAlkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and osteocalcin content were measured to evaluate osteoblast \n\ndifferentiation, in vivo. Prior to the assay, the explants were washed with Ca and Mg-free PBS solution. \n\nThen, explants were transferred to a 2 mL eppendorf and pulverized with zirconia balls as previously \n\nreported [25]. Prior to analysis the samples were sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 minute at \n\n4?C. To each well of a 96-well plate was added an aliquot of supernatant and p-nytrophenyl phosphate \n\nsubstrate (ZYMED\u00ae Laboratories, Invitrogen, USA) [28]. The plate was then incubated in the dark for 30 \n\nminutes at 37\u00baC and after that time the reaction was stopped with 1 M NaOH (Panreac). Standards \n\nwere prepared with p-nytrophenol, pNP. Triplicates were made for each sample and standard. \n\nAbsorbance was read at 405 nm (Wallac ARVOsx 1420, Perkin-Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, \n\nUSA), and sample concentrations were read off from the standard graph. Enzyme activity was \n\nexpressed either as nmol of pNP released/explant/30 minutes. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

Afterwards samples were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 \n\nminutes at 4?C. Then, the supernatant was passed through a SephadexTM G-25 column (GE \n\nhealthcare, Sweden), subsequently concentrated for performing the Enzyme-linked immunosorbent \n\nassay (ELISA). A Rat Osteocalcin EIA kit (N? BT-460, Biomedical Technologies Inc., MA, USA) was \n\nused following the instructions provided by the supplier. Data was read off from the standard curve \n\nobtained with human osteocalcin and expressed as ng of deposited osteocalcin per explant. \n\n2.5.4. Calcium content  \n\nAs an index of mineral bone formation, deposited calcium in the explants was quantified as described by            \n\nKim et al. [32,33], with minor modifications. Succinctly, explants were rinsed with Ca and Mg-free PBS \n\nsolution and 0.2 mL of 1N HCl per explants was added.  The tissues were chopped before being placed \n\non an orbital shaker to extract calcium for 12 hours. Then, mixtures were centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for \n\n10 minutes and supernatants were assayed using a commercial calcium assay kit (Calcium C-test\u2122, \n\nWako Pure Chemical Industries, Japan) and following the instructions provided by the supplier. \n\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\nThe water soluble nanoparticles could easily be characterized by NMR.  1H NMR spectra (in D2O) of the \n\nnanoparticles is shown in Figure 1 (albeit broad peaks). The 1H NMR spectrum of CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles (Figure 1A) is relatively complex but showed a singlet at 2.49 ppm, and \n\nmultiplets ? from 3.1 to 3.73 ppm and 4.07 ppm, which were ascribed to the H2 protons, the ring \n\nmethine protons (H3, H4, H5 and H6), and protons of \u2013CH2COO- groups of the CMCht [34,35]. Also, the \n\npresence of the PAMAM dendrimer is revealed by distinct peaks from 1.98 to 3.46 ppm. These have \n\nbeen attributed to CH2COO, CH2CO and CH2CN groups. In addition, new signals were not detected, but \n\nthe peaks at 2.49 and 3.46 ppm appears overlapped as a result of the resonances of the CH2COO and \n\nCH2 protons of both CMCht and PAMAM. The presence of the peak at ca. 3 ppm and the absence of a \n\npeak at 4.3 ppm can indicate that the substitutions occurred mainly on the C2 amino group of CMCht. \n\nThe spectrum of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (Figure 1B) shows the typical \n\nsignals from CMCht, PAMAM dendrimers and Dex. From spectrum it is possible to observe small \n\nsinglets at 1.14, 1.28 ppm and 1.86 ppm from CH3 and CH2 groups, and a doublet at 7.55 ppm and 7.96 \n\nppm which are attributed to the chemical shifts of the protons attached to C1 atoms and to aromatic ring \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

The latter signal has a low intensity but clearly shows that Dex was \n\neffectively incorporated into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nA \n\nB \n\n9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nppm\n\n(\n\n9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nppm\n\n(\n\nDex\n\n \n\nFigure 1. 1H NMR spectra of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (A), and Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (B), in D2O.  The signal around at ca. 4.61 ppm is ascribed to \n\nD2O. \n\nFigure 2 shows the TEM image of the CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles before and after incorporation of \n\nDex. This study clearly demonstrated the consistency in respect to shape of the synthesized \n\nmacromolecules, which exhibit a nanosphere-like shape. Moreover, we can observe that incorporation \n\nof Dex affect the morphology of the nanoparticles. In fact, it is possible to observe the formation \n\ndendron-like nanoparticles instead of the nanosphere-like structure. From Figure 2B it is possible to \n\nobserve aggregation of nanoparticles with ~4 nm. A possible explanation for this may be related with the \n\nself-aggregation behavior of CMCht. \n\nOn the other hand, since particle size is one of the most important parameters in drug carriers for \n\nintracellular delivery, we thus investigated here mainly the particle size and surface charge by dynamic \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

Moreover, to explore the influence of pH on the particle properties, Zeta \n\npotential was studied at physiological and lysosomal typical pH\u00b4s. \n\n \n\nFigure 2. Representative TEM images of the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles (A), and        \n\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticle (B). \n\nThe results are resumed in Table 1 and show that upon Dex loading into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles the hydrodynamic diameter of the particles increase, while no significant variation on the \n\nzeta potential was observed.  \n\nZeta potential is a property involving not only the particles but also their environment, e.g. pH, ionic \n\nstrength, and even the type of ions in the suspension [37]. By its turn, it is expected that CMCht has a \n\ngood pH and ion sensitivity in aqueous solution due to abundant \u2013COOH and \u2013NH2 groups. This is \n\nrelatively evident by the observed values of Zeta potential measured in a PBS solution (pH 7.4) and in \n\nwater. On the other hand, since zeta potential of particles is decided by their surface properties [38], this \n\ndata shows that the negatively charged carboxymethyl groups in the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles were mainly distribute at the surface of the nanoparticles, which clearly reveals the \n\nsuccessful surface engineering of the PAMAM dendrimers.  \n\nUpon incorporation of Dex the absolute value of Zeta potential decrease from 32.8 to 27.3 mV. The \n\nobserved decrease can explain in part, the particle agglomeration observed under the TEM. Moreover, \n\nthe increase the nanoparticle size in water can be related with particle agglomeration. Another possible \n\nexplanation for the aggregation of Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles can be related \n\nwith the increase of hydrophobicity upon incorporation of Dex. The present data is in agreement with \n\nother report by Yinsong et al. [39] that demonstrated the important role of the surface negatively charged \n\n(A) (B) \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

Zeta potential as a function of pH, and particle size distribution of unloaded and Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles. Data is shown as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (S.D.).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn an acidic medium, the amino and carboxylic groups of CMCht are protonated. Thus, as expected, the \n\nZeta potential of the nanoparticles at pH 3 loosed the strong negative character. This would mean that \n\nwithin the lysosomes (pH<<5.5), nanoparticles will gradually lead to neutralization of surface charge, i.e. \n\n\u2018\u2018proton sponge\u2019\u2019 effect. The neutralization of the surface charge will cause coagulation of the particles \n\nand prevent Dex release within lysosomes. In fact, the charge conversion has been reported to be \n\nbeneficial for lysosomal escape [40], and subsequently release Dex in the cytoplasm, where it can bind \n\nand activate the glucocorticoid receptor [41]. \n\nFigure 3 shows the RBMSCs viability when cultured in the presence of different culture medium, for 24 \n\nand 72 hours. Results have shown that the nanoparticles are not cytotoxic over RBMSCs at \n\nconcentrations bellow 1 mg.mL-1. As seen in the present work, no significant differences in the RBMSCs \n\nviability were observed when culturing in the presence of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles as compared to that for unloaded nanoparticles.  \n\nAs previously stated, particle size can affect internalization. On the other hand, in a report by          \n\nZhang et al. [42] it was demonstrated that Dex treatment decrease the phagocytosis of Straphylococcus \n\naureus bioparticles in normal primary trabecular meshwork cells. \n\nTo investigate if the incorporation of Dex into the nanoparticles affects the internalization by RBMSCs, a \n\nFITC-probe was linked to the nanoparticles.

This can be associated to a dual effect that \n\nincludes on one hand the larger size of Dex-loaded nanoparticles and on the other the Dex-induced \n\nsuppression of phagocytotic activity [42]. Moreover, the RBMSCs were stained with propidium iodide to \n\nassess the fraction of live cells. From Table 2, it is possible to observe that the fraction of live cells \n\ncultured in the presence of FITC-labeled Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not \n\nsignificantly differ from that of controls, i.e. RBMSCs cultured with the FITC-labeled CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles and in MEM medium. This corroborates the luminescent viability assay, \n\ndemonstrating that incorporation of Dex into the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles did not elicit \n\nany cytotoxic effect over RBMSCs.  \n\nTable 2.

SPCL scaffolds with \n\n67.4 \u00b1 1.3% porosity (as determined by \u00b5-CT) were used as the 3-D matrix, since it have been shown to \n\nbe adequate for supporting RBMSCs osteogenic differentiation, in vitro [25]. Since these scaffolds exhibit \n\nlower attenuation coefficient than that for bone or calcium phosphates, i.e. the intensity of the x-ray \n\nbeam is reduced less as it passes through the SPCL material [26], we can envision to obtain images and \n\ndetermine the total volume of newly formed bone into implants by using the micro-CT technique. We \n\ntherefore cultured in vitro, RBMSCs in the presence of 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles until reaching confluence, seeded the RBMSCs onto the surface of the SPCL \n\nscaffolds overnight followed by subcutaneous implantation into the back of F344/N rats, for 4 weeks. \n\nThe effect of cell number on the bone forming ability was also investigated, since previously we \n\ndemonstrated that it influences new bone formation [31].

Dexamethasone-loaded carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles induces osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of rat bone marrow stromal cells and ectopic bone formation \n\n \n\n \n \n- 362 - \n \n\nsupply of Dex for longer time and in a regimented manner, as Dex can be released from the \n\nnanoparticles inside cells during in vivo implantation time. \n\nSuccinctly, the biochemical data shows that porous SPCL scaffolds alone do not induce bone formation \n\nupon subcutaneous implantation in the back of the F344/N rats. However, by seeding RBMSCS \n\nsupplemented with Dex onto the scaffolds bone formation could be detected, when cell number was      \n\n1 x 106. Moreover, the use of CMCht/PAMAM nanoparticles for the intracellular delivery of Dex stimulate \n\nstem cells differentiation towards production of bone mineral in the absence of the typical osteogenic \n\nsupplements, in vivo. \n\nAs revealed by \u00b5-CT analyses, histology and calcium assay, the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles internalization by RBMSCs ex vivo can afford a regimented supply of Dex in vivo, and \n\nstimulate RBMSCs to produce superior bone mineral. Remarkably, the SPCL scaffolds proved to be \n\nadequate for fundamental studies as they studies support bone formation in vivo, allowing also the \n\nanalysis of new bone using a nondestructive technique such as micro-computed tomography.  \n\n4. CONCLUSIONS \n\nDex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles were successfully developed.  Results obtained \n\nfrom 1H NMR, TEM, Zeta potential and particle size analysis revealed that Dex incorporation greatly \n\ninfluences the structure and the surface characteristics of the nanoparticles. These were found to \n\npossess pH and ionic-responsive nature. The in vitro tests showed that the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles at concentrations bellow 1 mg.mL-1 do not exert any significant cytotoxic effect \n\nover RBMSCs. Furthermore, its ability for being taken up by RBMSCs was shown and incorporation of \n\nDex into the nanoparticles showed to decrease their internalization efficiency. Complementarily, it was \n\nshown that these Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles have the ability to promote in \n\nvitro mineralization, denoting its osteogenic ability. Moreover, the in vivo studies proved that the Dex-\n\nloaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may find applications in bone tissue engineering and \n\nregenerative medicine strategies, namely as an intracellular drug delivery nanocarrier able to promote \n\nthe osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs and inducing superior de novo bone formation. To our \n\nknowledge the present work demonstrate for the first time, the use of non cytotoxic nanoparticles able to \n\nprogram the differentiation pathway from the interior of stem cells, being able, in particular to promote \n\nsuperior bone formation in vivo when using stromal cells. This work mark the transition from \u2018proof-of-\n\nconcept\u2019 to useful intracellular nanocarrier tool as these nanoparticles show promise in clinically relevant \n\napproaches for bone regeneration. \n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.

SUMMARY AND GENERAL CONCLUSIONS \n\nNanotechnology and medicine research are merging with other fields leading to completely new science \n\nand superior technological platforms such as those recently reported for regenerative medicine and \n\nneurosciences. The main aim of this thesis was to exploit a new concept based on combining \n\nnanotechnology and traditional tissue engineering strategies towards developing more efficient \n\napproaches for the treatment of damage/diseased cells and tissues. The use of surface engineered \n\ndendrimers to deliver bioactive agents from inside the cells is aimed at improve in vivo, the biological \n\nperformance of stem cell alone or combined with scaffolds, the so-called cells-scaffold constructs.   \n\nDendrimers and their derivatives have been exhibiting unique physicochemical properties which have \n\ngreat potential to be used as nanocarriers in a variety of applications, including tissue engineering and \n\nregenerative medicine, which have been discussed in the first chapter of this thesis. Though, high \n\ngeneration dendrimers with amine capping-groups causes haemolysis and changes in red cell \n\nmorphology, since they bind to negatively charged membranes of cells in a non-specific manner and \n\ncan cause toxicity in vitro and in vivo. To circumvent this drawback, we modified the surface of low \n\ngeneration poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers with carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht), to reduce the \n\ncytotoxic effects of cationic and high-generation dendrimers and reduce the haemolytic toxicity by \n\nreduction/shielding of the positive charge on the dendrimer surface, while enhancing the peripheral \n\ncongestion to improve container properties. Carboxymethylchitosan was chosen due to its water \n\nsolubility, low toxicity and antimicrobial activity making it attractive for applications in the controlled \n\nrelease of drugs. Thus, carboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (CMCht/PAMAM) \n\nnanoparticles were prepared in a stepwise manner as follows: (i) increasing the generation of the \n\nPAMAM-carboxylic terminated (G 1.5), (ii) obtaining a PAMAM-methyl ester terminated dendrimer, (iii) \n\nreaction of PAMAM and CMCht, i.e. the reaction goes through a condensation reaction between the \n\nmethyl ester and amine groups, and (iv) modifying the methyl ester groups that do not react to \n\ncarboxylic ones in the CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer, followed by precipitation. As a model drug, \n\ndexamethasone (Dex) was incorporated into CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles due to its \n\nimportant role in osteogenesis and clinical relevance.  \n\n \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Summary and general conclusions \n\n \n \n- 372 - \n \n\nTo assess the potential of using the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles systems for \n\napplication in tissue engineering, we used different biomaterials to develop a set of novel scaffolds (3-D \n\nsystems) suitable for applications in bone, cartilage and osteochondral tissue engineering.  \n\nChitosan was used a biomaterial for developing support for cartilage due to its easy processability and \n\nbiological properties such as biocompatibility and immunological, antibacterial and wound-healing \n\nactivity. Moreover, chitosan shares structural characteristics with various glucosaminoglycans (GAGs) \n\nand given its importance in stimulating the chondrogenesis, the use of GAG analogs as components of \n\na cartilage tissue engineered scaffold is desired for improving chondrogenesis.  \n\nHydroxylapatite was used a a biomaterial to develop scaffolds for bone applications since its \n\nstructure resembles to the primary mineral component of bone. Other advantages include the good \n\nprocessability, non-cytotoxicity, non-immunogenicity, resorbability and osteoconductivity.  \n\nStarch-based biomaterials such as the starch-polycaprolactone (SPCL) were also used within the scope \n\nof this thesis mainly due to the advantages of being non-cytotoxicity, biodegradable, present good \n\nmechanical properties and can be processed by different methodologies. Processability is an important \n\nfeature which can allow us to tailor the final properties of the scaffolds, and can be a major advantage in \n\ncomparative studies. Moreover, it can be possible to investigate qualitatively and quantitatively the \n\ncalcified tissue within the explants using a non-destructive and time-saving technique such as micro-\n\ncomputed tomography, as polymeric materials exhibit lower attenuation coefficient as compared to bone \n\nor ceramics.  \n\nThe general conclusions of the research work produced in the present thesis, which extends from \n\nChapter III to X, are summarized as follows. \n\n1.1. NOVEL HYDROXYLAPATITE/CARBOXYMETHYLCHITOSAN COMPOSITE SCAFFOLDS PREPARED THROUGH AN \n\nINNOVATIVE \u201cAUTOCATALYTIC\u201d ELECTROLESS CO-PRECIPITATION ROUTE \n\nChapter III describes the \u201cautocatalytic\u201d electroless deposition route for production of a composite \n\nscaffolds composed of hydroxylapatite (HAp) and carboxymethylchitosan (CMCht) for bone tissue-\n\nengineering scaffolding applications. This work demonstrated that it is possible to prepare such \n\ncomposite scaffolds by means of combining a novel acidic \u201cautocatalytic\u201d co-precipitation route and a \n\nnovel wax spheres leaching methodology. The physicochemical properties of the composite scaffolds \n\nmay be tailored, especially the 3-D architecture, content in organic-inorganic phases, and dissolution \n\nbehaviour. Therefore, these composite scaffolds are very promising whenever degradability and \n\nbioactivity are simultaneously desired, such as in the case of bone tissue-engineering scaffolding \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Summary and general conclusions \n\n \n \n\n- 373 - \n \n\napplications. Moreover, these novel composite scaffolds can possibly support the incorporation of      \n\npH-sensitive proteins up to physiological pH, which is known to be one major drawback of chitosan \n\nmaterials for such type of applications. Despite, the promissing data, no cell culture studies were carried \n\nout in order to fully exploit its potential usefulness in tissue engineering applications. \n\n1.2. MACROPOROUS HYDROXYLAPATITE SCAFFOLDS FOR BONE TISSUE ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS: \n\nPHYSICOCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION AND ASSESSMENT OF RAT BONE MARROW STROMAL CELL VIABILITY  \n\nChapter IV reports a new methodology for developing HAp scaffolds by using an organic sacrifice \n\ntemplate, and its potential to find applications in bone tissue engineering scaffolding investigated. The \n\nnovelty of this work consists on the possibility of obtaining porous and highly interconnected scaffolds \n\nmimicking the sacrificial component. In fact, this work demonstrated that it is possible to prepare \n\nsintered hydroxylapatite scaffolds with high interconnectivity by impregnating the template of \u2018open-cell\u2019 \n\npolyurethane (PU) sponge into the HAp slurry, followed by sponge burn-out. The preparation route was \n\noptimized for producing macroporous HAp structures with controlled morphology, easily mediated by the \n\narchitecture of the PU sponge. In vitro tests have demonstrated that such constructs are bioactive, as \n\nobserved by the formation of an apatite layer after 1 day of immersion in SBF solution. The \n\nbiocompatible behaviour of the macroporous HAp scaffold was demonstrated as evidenced by the non-\n\ncytotoxic effect over L929 cells. Moreover, the cell/material interaction tests have shown that the \n\nRBMSCs adhered, proliferated well and remained viable on the macroporous hydroxylapatite scaffolds. \n\nMore importantly, the cells were able to populate the inner of the macroporous HAp scaffolds. \n\nTherefore, the physicochemical and biological properties of the macroporous HAp scaffolds have shown \n\nto be suitable for bone tissue-engineering applications. \n\n1.3. NOVEL HYDROXYLAPATITE/CHITOSAN BILAYERED SCAFFOLD FOR OSTEOCHONDRAL TISSUE ENGINEERING \n\nAPPLICATIONS \n\nChapter V demonstrates the feasibility to prepare hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffolds by means \n\nof an innovative method that combines a sintering and a freeze-drying technique. The novel \n\nmacroporous hydroxylapatite/chitosan bilayered scaffolds exhibit physicochemical properties that \n\nappear to make them a suitable candidate to be used as a supportive structure for cells functions. \n\nMoreover, the in vitro cell culture studies demonstrated that both HAp and CHT layers provide an \n\nadequate 3-D support for the attachment, proliferation and differentiation of goat bone marrow stromal \n\ncells (GBMSCs) into osteoblasts and chondrocytes, respectively. The HAp/CHT bilayered scaffolds are \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Summary and general conclusions \n\n \n \n- 374 - \n \n\nadvantageous by several reasons, namely they can be designed with several sizes and controlled \n\narchitecture to fit patient specific injuries and cell functions, respectively. The HAp/CHT bilayered \n\nscaffolds showed promising biological behavior and may therefore find applications in tissue \n\nengineering of bone and osteochondral defects. \n\n1.4. IN VITRO INVESTIGATION OF DEX-LOADED AND CMCHT/PAMAM DENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES: \n\nINTERNALIZATION EFFICIENCY AND MECHANISM, AND OSTEOGENIC POTENTIAL (2-D SYSTEM) \n\nIn this thesis we demonstrated that the combination of synthetic and natural-based polymers \n\nenable to prepare CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles of suitable diameters to cover a wide \n\nrange of intracellular delivery applications (Chapter VI and VII). In vitro tests showed that the \n\ncarboxymethylchitosan/poly(amidoamine) dendrimer nanoparticles do not exert any significant \n\ncytotoxic effect over both L929 fibroblast, post-natal neurons and glial cells and RBMSCs for \n\nconcentrations below 1 mg.mL-1. Furthermore, the successful internalization of the nanoparticles \n\nby two different types of cells, i.e. cell lines and primary cultures, was also demonstrated. We also \n\nproved that the mechanism by which these nanoparticles are taken up by cells is not exclusively \n\nendocytotic. The biochemical data presented herein also proved that the Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles induced the osteogenic differentiation of RBMSCs in \n\nvitro, in TCPS 2-D substrates. Therefore, the novel CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may \n\nbe used as targeted-drug delivery carriers covering a wide range of applications involving the \n\nefficient intracellular delivery of biological agents to modulate the behaviour of cells. These might \n\ninclude the use of differentiation factors to act from the inside the cell or genetic material. The \n\nincorporation of fluorescent labels for live-cell imaging and monitoring of the final intracellular fate \n\nof such structures is also possible.  \n\n \n\n1.5. IN VITRO ASSESSMENT OF OSTEOGENIC DIFFERENTIATION WHEN COMBINING DEX-LOADED CMCHT/PAMAM \n\nDENDRIMER NANOPARTICLES, STEM CELLS AND, EITHER HAP AND SPCL SCAFFOLDS (3-D SYSTEM) \n\nIn this thesis, it was our aim to fully investigate the biological performance of the macroporous HAp and \n\nSPCL scaffolds when seeded with RBMSCs exposed to Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer \n\nnanoparticles. These two types of scaffolds were chosen for their similar architecture, i.e. porosity, \n\ninterconnectivity and pore size, while possessing different composition. Both were found to be adequate \n\nfor culturing RBMSCs, namely for adhesion, proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, in vitro (Chapter \n\nVIII). Despite, RBMSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation are favoured when cultured onto the \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Summary and general conclusions \n\n \n \n\n- 375 - \n \n\nsurface of the HAp scaffolds, but the results obtained for SPCL are quite similar and much better than \n\none could expect for a biodegradable polymer. On the other hand, the biochemical data demonstrated \n\nthat the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles enhanced the early osteogenic \n\ndifferentiation of RBMSCs in a 3-D environment, in vitro.  \n\n1.6. IN VIVO PROOF-OF-CONCEPT \n\nChapter IX exploited the potential of the combinatorial strategy in tissue engineering principles \n\nemploying CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles towards the intracellular release and regimented \n\nsupply of dexamethasone (Dex) aimed at control stem cells osteogenic differentiation in the absence of \n\ntypical osteogenic inducers, in vivo. In this work, we have demonstrated that cell number and ex vivo \n\nculturing strategies greatly influences the osteogenesis and de novo bone formation, in vivo. RBMSCs \n\nexpanded with 0.01 mg.mL-1 Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles and seeded at low \n\ncell number on the surface of the HAp scaffolds enhanced the ectopic bone formation, after 4 weeks of \n\nsubcutaneous implantation in the back of F344/N rats. This study revealed that the novel Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles may be beneficial as intracellular nanocarrier and supply of \n\nDex in a regimented manner to modulate and direct stem cells differentiation towards osteogenic \n\nphenotype, enhance proteoglycan extracellular matrix synthesis and superior ectopic de novo bone \n\nformation. The architecture of HAp scaffolds proved to be a good support for osteogenic differentiation \n\nof bone marrow derived osteoblast and new bone formation, in vivo. Thus, the tissue engineering \n\nstrategy proposed in this thesis showed to be effective on promoting de novo bone formation in vivo and \n\navoid the long time of in vitro culturing in the presence of osteogenic cocktails which is seen as major \n\ndrawback for most clinical applications.  \n\nComplementarily, Chapter X report deeper studies on the chemistry of the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM \n\ndendrimer nanoparticles and also the in vivo osteogenic ability. These nanoparticles were found to \n\npossess pH and ionic-responsive nature. Moreover, we have observed that Dex incorporation greatly \n\ninfluences the structure of the nanoparticles. The in vitro tests showed that the Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles at concentrations bellow 1 mg.mL-1 do not exert any significant \n\ncytotoxic effect over RBMSCs. Furthermore, its ability for being taken up by RBMSCs was shown and \n\nincorporation of Dex into the nanoparticles decreases their internalization efficiency. It was shown that \n\nthese Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles have the ability to promote in vitro \n\nmineralization, denoting its osteogenic ability. In vivo, the biochemical data revealed that porous SPCL \n\nscaffolds alone do not induce bone formation upon subcutaneous implantation in the back of the F344/N \n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI. Summary and general conclusions \n\n \n \n- 376 - \n \n\nrats. However, by seeding RBMSCs supplemented with Dex onto the scaffolds bone formation could be \n\ndetected, when cell number was 1 x 106 cells.  Moreover, these studies proved that the Dex-loaded \n\nCMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles internalization by RBMSCs ex vivo, can afford a regimented \n\nsupply of Dex in vivo, and stimulate RBMSCs to produce superior bone mineral. Remarkably, the SPCL \n\nscaffolds proved to be adequate for fundamental studies as it revealed by in vivo studies supported \n\nbone formation, while allow qualitative and quantitative analyses of the newly bone formed using a non-\n\ndestructive technique such as the micro-computed tomography. \n\nAs a final remark, this thesis mark the transition from \u2018proof-of-concept\u2019 to useful intracellular nanocarrier \n\ntool, as the Dex-loaded CMCht/PAMAM dendrimer nanoparticles show promise for applications in \n\nseveral cells and tissues therapies. The use of these nanocarriers towards the incorporation of multiple \n\nbioactive agents and formulations aimed at find applications in osteochondral tissue engineering or for \n\ntargeting central nervous system can also be envisioned. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\tJoaquim Miguel Antunes de Oliveira.pdf\n\tP\u00e1gina 1\n\tP\u00e1gina 2\n\tP\u00e1gina 3\n\tP\u00e1gina 4\n\n\tTHESIS OLIVEIRA JM.pdf"}]}}}
