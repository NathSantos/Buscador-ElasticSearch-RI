Este tipo de ind\u00fastria tem a \nara\nter\u00edsti\na de produzir\n\npe\u00e7as de elevada \nomplexidade atrav\u00e9s de p\u00f3 met\u00e1li\no. Nos v\u00e1rios est\u00e1gios\n\nque \nara\nteriza a metalurigia do p\u00f3, dois s\u00e3o essen\niais: o pro\nesso de\n\n\nompa\nta\u00e7\u00e3o e o pro\nesso de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o. No pro\nesso de \nompa\nta\u00e7\u00e3o,\n\na preo\nupa\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 em produzir um \norpo poroso, em que tenha as \nara\n-\n\nteristi\nas me\n\u00e2ni\nas ideias para prosseguir para o est\u00e1gio de sinteriza\u00e7\u00e3o.\n\nAssim, a \nompa\nta\u00e7\u00e3o de p\u00f3s met\u00e1li\nos pode ser simulada re\norrendo a\n\nmodelos \nont\u00ednuos elasto-pl\u00e1sti\nos adoptados da me\n\u00e2ni\na dos solos.

This type\n\nof industry has the quality of produ\ning pie\nes with high \nomplexity through\n\nmetalli\n powder. Powder metallurgy, in the many steps that \nhara\nterizes,\n\nthere is two major steps: the \nompa\ntion pro\ness and the sintering pro\ness.\n\nIn the \nompa\ntion pro\ness, the major \non\nern is in produ\ning a porous\n\nbody, the green \nompa\nt, whi\nh me\nhani\n \nhara\nteristi\ns are the ideal for\n\npro\needing to the sintering stage. Therefore, the \nompa\ntion of metalli\n\npowders \nan be simulated using phenomenologi\nal elasto-plasti\n \nontinuum\n\nmodels adapted from soils me\nhani\ns. These models are typi\nally imple-\n\nmented in ?nite element \nodes and are used to investigate the ma\nros\nopi\n\nproperty distributions in powders during \nompa\ntion. The present study\n\ndemonstrates the ?ow behaviour of a metalli\n powder, an agglomerated\n\nstainless steel, that is des\nribed by the modi?ed Dru\nker-Prager/\nap\n\nelasto-plasti\nity model developed for powder appli\nations. A \nommer\nial\n\n?nite element \node implementing the Dru\nker-Prager/Cap model was used\n\nto model the \nompression and de\nompression stages of powder \nompa\ntion.\n\nThe parameters used in the Dru\nker-Prager/Cap model were obtained from\n\nthe literature. This model was implemented with a user subroutine UVARM\n\nand the relative density at the end of the \nompa\ntion stage was predi\nted.\n\nIn the sintering stage, the main goal is to obtain a full dense body. There-\n\nfore, an implementation of an a\n\nurate sintering model into a ?nite element\n\nsimulation program is ne\nessary for representing the pro\ness e?\nien\ny.\n\nThe densi?\nation and \nreep behaviour of stainless steel powder during free\n\nsintering was simulated and the material model was implemented by linking\n\nthe CREEP subroutine to the Abaqus ?nite element \node. This approa\nh\n\nis based upon the \nontinuum theories of elasti\n and non-linear-vis\nous de-\n\nformation of porous bodies. The porosity is updated during the simulation.\n\nGrain growth, gravity, thermal expansion, thermal \nondu\ntivity, and other\n\nheterogeneous fa\ntors are also \nonsidered during the simulation. Appli\nation\n\nin an axysimmetri\n model is made and simulation results of axial shrinkage\n\nand density distribution is dis\nussed after sintering.\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nI Framing and

has become one of the most\nwidely used manufacturing technique in the metallurgy industry. The potential of this\nmanufacturing technique is the possibility to manufacture complex parts with tight tol-\nerances in an economical manner, especially for metals with high melting points and\nhigh hardness levels [1].\n\nPM is a processing technique that involves the production of metal powders and\nconversion of these powders into engineered components. The steps of the typical process\ninvolve powder compaction in rigid dies and then heating of the compacted powder to\nbond the particles together. At the beginning, the powder starts as a fluid-like substance,\nwhere it is neither a liquid nor a strict solid [2].\n\nIn the compaction stage, the metal powder flows into a die cavity at room tempera-\nture and is physically pressed in the die leading to the formation of weak friction bonds\nbetween the particles to form a certain shape. Thus, the connection between particles\nduring this stage is frail. The compact is usually very week. At the same time the pres-\nsure is applied, the powder in the die undergoes several stages: rearrangement of the\nparticles, elastic deformation, fragmentation (for brittle materials) or strain hardening\n(for ductile materials) and the deformation [1]. After the compaction stage, the powder\ntakes on the properties of a solid. Although weak after compaction, the solid component\ncan be heated to a temperature where the particles sinter to one another forming strong\nbonds [2]. This is called the sintering stage, where the compacted powder is put into the\nfurnace and heated to some temperature below the melting point, usually with a holding\nperiod. The friction existing between the die wall and the powder and the cross-section\nvariation can causes: density gradients, residual stresses and cracks, which can occur in\nthe green compact [1].\n\nDuring the sintering stage, particle connection is formed mainly due to the atomic\nmotions that eliminate the high surface energy associated with the powder. Several\natomic motion paths have been found and categorized to six mechanisms of mass trans-\nportation according to modern sintering theory. Among the mechanisms, the grain\nboundary diffusion tends to be more important to the densification of most crystalline\nmaterials and appears to dominate the densification of many common metal powder\nsystems [1]. These concepts can be found in chapters 3 and 4 for a detailed explanation.\n\nIn the solid-state sintering, when the material consolidates, it is inevitable that the\n\n3\n\n\n\n4 1.Introduction\n\npart shrinks, from a macroscopic point of view. If the shrinkage is not uniform, the part\ncan suffer distortion. The primary reason for the distortion is that the compact is not a\nuniform material. This comes from the nonuniform density distributions created during\ncompaction. As a downside to this process of manufacturing components, it has been\nreported that 50 - 90% of the total component cost is due to extra machining to achieve\nthe net desired shape [1].\n\nIn order to avoid an additional stage of hard machining to address the distortion and\nachieve the desired requirements, the process specification must be tailored to minimize\ndensity variation in the compaction stage and to provide controlled/expected shrinkage\nduring the sintering stage [1].\n\nThese sintered products have many benefits, among them, they hold the shape im-\nparted by the compaction die, but builds up strength in sintering. Many variants exist\nto this basic process [2].\n\nFigure 1.1 demonstrates an overall process of powder metallurgy. Of these materials,\nsteels are the dominant metallic species. A few powder metallurgy components are\nvery large, the shapes can range from a simple cylindrical bearing to very complex\nstructures such as hollow golf-club heads and helical seat gears. In this type of industry\nthe tooling cost is substantially high, so, for this reason most PM production is targeted\nat structures manufactured at high rates (measured typically in parts per year), such\nas for automobiles, lawnmowers, home appliances, business machines, computers, and\nother electromechanical structures [2].\n\nFigure 1.1: The powder metallurgy process [3].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n1.Introduction 5\n\n1.2 Historical Perspective\n\nThe PM process had several successes in ancient times (probably as early as 3000 BC)\nwith the manufacturing of coins and implements in ancient Egypt, gold-platinum powder\ncompacts by the Incas, an iron pillar in India, copper coins in Germany, and platinum\ncrucibles in the 1800s in England and Russia. The modern era is traced to Coolidge\u2019s\nexperiments in the early 1900s (working for Edison) and the production of tungsten\nlamp filaments for the light bulb, a process that is still used today. By the 1930s sev-\neral products emerged, including porous bronze bearings, tungsten radiation containers,\ncopper-graphite electrical contacts, cemented carbides for metal cutting, and the first\nsteel mechanical components. By the 1950s the industry became organized and the\nfield emerged as a viable production technology for selected components. Early PM\nwas applied mostly to small stress, moderately complex components as an alternative to\nmachining [2].\n\nBy the 1960s, interest in the net-shaping attribute of powder metallurgy emerged.\nThis idea relies on the attainment of final dimensions in the powder forming step, by that\navoiding machining. Aerospace uses grew with the development of fully-density fabrica-\ntion techniques, such as hot isostatic pressing. In the 1970s there emerged recognition of\nthe rapid solidification rates possible in powder atomization, allowing the production of\nnew compositions with novel properties. In more recent years, many new alloys, property\ncombinations, and production technologies have emerged [2].\n\nNowadays, the PM industry is constituted by many companies, each with special-\nization in alloys, applications, and productions techniques. The largest activity is asso-\nciated with ferrous alloys, some iron, and many steels. In spite of the many processes,\nPM faces many competitors from alternative forming technologies and alternative ma-\nterials - mainly fine blanked steels, cast steels, die-cast zinc, injection-molded plastics,\ninjection-molded ceramics, extruded aluminum matrix composites, and machined steels\n[2].\n\nFerrous alloys constitute the dominant powders, and structural automotive compo-\nnents constitutive the dominant applications. The combination of low production costs\nand high sintering strength dominates the PM selection criteria. Since high density is\na precursor to high strength, the trend is toward higher densities to improve mechan-\nical properties. Production technologies that allow high final densities include high-\ntemperature sintering, powder forging, powder rolling, injection molding, infiltration,\nhot isostatic compaction, pneumatic forging, and warm compaction [2].\n\n1.3 Overview of Processes and Steps\n\nThe PM processes can be divided in two major areas. One area is in injection molding\nand the other area starts with loose powders. In the powder injection moulding (PIM),\nthe feedstock is sintered to nearly full density at high temperatures. Here, the powder\nis shaped in the forming step, but not compacted. More importantly, the particles\nare densified in sintering and not during compaction. The other major area of powder\nmetallurgy is encountered in traditional die compaction, where densification occurs in\npressing. Here, sintering has little impact on densification and is largely used to bond\nthe particles. Between these two major areas, various technologies exist where sintering\nand compaction are combined for densification. Some examples occur in hot pressing,\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n6 1.Introduction\n\nhot isostatic pressing and hot forging. Pressure-based densification depends on lower\nsintering temperatures, larger particle sizes, and higher forming pressures to densify the\npowder. Alternatively, sintering-based densification relies on low forming pressures, high\nsintering temperatures and small powders. The hybrid densification techniques apply\nsimultaneously temperature and pressure to obtain a pore-free product [2].\n\nFor example, die compaction compresses the powder to produce a density 2-3 times\nthe initial powder density. Alternatively, injection molding applies a relatively lower\npressure that shapes the powder, so, the particles are neither deformed nor densified.\nThese forming steps are characterized by typical stresses or pressures and forming times.\nDie compaction occurs in roughly one second [2].\n\nWith respect to the sintering step, some technologies rely on low temperature to bond\nthe particles, while others rely on high temperatures to densify the structure. Sintering\ndensification results in volume changes, while bonding results only in a strength gain.\nAgain, each process is characterized by a typical temperature and time. Various PM\nfabrication techniques rely on a combination of pressure and temperature. For example,\nhot isostatic compaction might involve 200 MPa at 800 ?C for one hour to densify a steel\npowder [2].\n\n1.4 Needs for Research\n\nAs have been mentioned in this chapter, sintering process is one of the most power-\nful techniques to obtain components with high complexity and excellent response in\nmechanical performance. However, and particularly in complex components, the prob-\nability for some imperfections and geometric distortions to appear, from high levels of\nresidual stresses with consequently smooth fractures, is high.\n\nTherefore, numerical methods can be suitable tools to develop specific numeric simu-\nlations of the process. As computer technology and numerical algorithms develop rapidly\nnowadays, numerical tools such as the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Discrete Ele-\nment Method (DEM) become more popular and powerful. Compared with the empirical\noptimization (trial and error method), numerical simulation is less expensive and shows\na more efficient use time, especially for newly designed products [1].\n\n1.5 Research Objectives\n\nThe ambit of this investigation work is to develop some competences in the powder\nmetallurgy simulation area. Therefore, it is necessary to build an accurate numerical\nmodel to determine the shape change, i.e., shrinkage and distortion of the compacted\npowder after the sintering. To reach this objective, it is necessary complete intermediate\ngoals as:\n\n?

The most common process of consolidation in powder metallurgy is\nthe uniaxial die compaction. This process consists in compressing loose powders into\nthe die cavity by the application of pressure, forming a solid \u201cgreen\u201d part of relatively\nhigh density that conforms to the shape of the cavity. The pressure is usually applied\nalong one axis into the cavity where the loose powder is pressed in the y-direction and\nhas a lateral constrain as shown in figure 2.1. This deformation is defined by a decrease\nin porosity and an increase in particle bond strength [2]. This process is extremely fast\nand has a great potential for mass production of parts such as those in the automobile\nindustry [4].\n\nWhen the pressure required to apply in compaction is higher, higher also, will be the\ndensity of the compact. With standard tool steel or cemented carbide dies and punches,\ndensities can theoretically reach up to 90% without tool damage. The compact with a\nmodest density and strength after compaction is fragile and may break upon impact.\nTherefore needs to be sintered in a furnace with controlled atmosphere at a temperature\napproximately 80% of the melting temperature of the material, in order to attain the\ndesired strength. During the sintering stage, the powder particles bond together, which\ncan result in dimensional distortion of the compact. It is proven that the dimensional\nchange is inversely proportional to the density of the compact; consequently density\ngradients in the green part will produce shape distortion [4].\n\nDuring the compaction process, axial forces applied by the compaction load result\nin radial forces being generated at the die walls. Between the powder and the tool com-\nponents there is friction. These frictional forces exist because of the applied pressure\nalong the die wall decreases along the depth of the powder column. Due to a differential\nand non-uniform pressure distribution during the compaction process, it is produced a\ndensity gradient in the green parts. During the entire process of sintering, these den-\nsities gradients lead to non-symmetrical dimensional changes. Near the punches faces\nare located regions of high density that exhibit small dimensional changes, while in re-\ngions away from the punch faces have lower density, and for that reason exhibit larger\ndimensional change. This leads to a loss of dimensional precision on the finished com-\nponent. The compaction process study is important for ensure uniformity in dimensions\nand properties after sintering, variations in green density need to be minimized and\n\n9\n\n\n\n10 2.Powder Compaction\n\nFigure 2.1: Schematic of a uniaxial die compaction process [4].\n\nunderstood. In order to minimize density gradients is recommended reducing the fric-\ntion during the compaction phase by adding lubricants in the powder or in the die-wall\nsurface [4].\n\nMany compaction options exist, including hard and soft tooling, heating the die and\npowder, using rolling mills and even shock waves. Table 2.1 shows a categorization\nand comparison of compaction options in PM. This table includes the main processing\nvariants that uses different pressures to densify the powder in compaction. Each process\nassociated to the nominal operating parameters, including pressing directions, shape\ncomplexity, and relative use. Differences in the compaction pressures and temperature\nhelp categorize the options [2].\n\nTable 2.1: Compaction options [2].\nProcess Cold\n\nIsostatic\nCom-\npaction\n\nCold\nForging\n\nDie\nCom-\npaction\n\nExplosive\nCom-\npaction\n\nRoll\nCom-\npaction\n\nWarm\nCom-\npaction\n\nPressure Moderate,\n400 MPa\n\nVery\nhigh, >\n800 MPa\n\nHigh,\n700 MPa\n\nVery\nhigh,\n> 1 GPa\n\nLow High,\n700 MPa\n\nTemperature Ambient Ambient Ambient Very\nhigh\n\nAmbient Warm\n\nTooling Soft Hard Hard Soft Hard Hard,\nheated\n\nDeformation\nRate\n\nLow High High Very\nhigh\n\nLow High\n\nContinuous No No No No Yes No\nShape com-\nplexity\n\nModerate\nto high\n\nModerate High Low Low Moderate\n\nPrecision Low Moderate High Low High High\nUse Moderate Low Extensive Very low Moderate Low\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n2.Powder Compaction 11\n\n2.2 Techniques of Compaction\n\n2.2.1 Die Compaction\n\nDie compaction involves the pressurization of the powder in a rigid tool set. A concep-\ntualization of a die compaction cycle is given by figure 2.2. Powder is loaded into the\ncavity by gravity from a feed shoe that sweeps over the die opening. A few important\nfeatures of the tool set become evident: the die body, lower punch, upper punch, and\nfeed shoe. The lower punch is in the fill position during powder entry, but then drops\nto a lower position to create room for the upper punch to enter the die cavity. In the\nmost common pressing cycle, the two punches work toward the center of the compact\nto densify the powder: double-action pressing. After application of the peak pressure,\nthe upper punch is pulled from the die while the lower punch pushes the compact out\nof the die. After this point the cycle repeats [2].\n\nFigure 2.2: Die compaction scheme [2].\n\n2.2.2 Warm Compaction\n\nOne way to improve green density of die-compacted powder is to heat the powder be-\nfore the compaction. Various technologies known as warm compaction are emerging to\nperforming simultaneous heating and bonding during pressing. Both the powder and\nthe tooling are heated in warm compaction. A typical temperature for the powder and\ntooling might be 150 ?C, and compaction pressures are usually in the range of 700 MPa.\nHeating of the die and punches requires modifications to the compaction press, and a\nheater is required in the powder feed mechanism. Both microwave and hot-oil heaters\nare available for bringing the powder up to a temperature near 150 ?C. Depending on\nwhich polymer is selected the ejection forces can be highly variable [2].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n12 2.Powder Compaction\n\n2.2.3 Cold Isostatic Compression\n\nCold isostatic pressing (CIP) is a common process applied in complex shapes involving\nundercuts or large length/diameter ratios. This process is based on a flexible mould to\napply pressure to the powder from all directions. For the CIP process, powder is filled\nin the flexible tooling and the sealed tooling is pressurized in a vessel filled with a fluid\nsuch as oil or water. Lubricants are rarely used. The work pressures in CIP can reach\n1400 MPa but usually are performed at below of 420 MPa. During pressurization all\nseals must be under compression to prevent leakage of the pressurization fluid into the\npowder. Usually, an external support is needed to help hold the bag shape during powder\nloading, and in some situations the bag is evacuated to remove air prior compaction [2].\n\nThere are two variants of cold isostatic pressing: the wet-bag and the dry-bag tech-\nniques. The wet bag (figure 2.3), the filled and sealed mould is immersed into a fluid\nchamber that is pressurized by an external hydraulic system. This particulate conceptu-\nalization would be appropriate for forming a hollow tube by pressing the powder against\na solid core. Ceased the compaction process, the wet mould (or bag) is removed from\nthe chamber and compact extracted from the mould [2].\n\nFigure 2.3: Wet bag technique using in CIP [5].\n\nThe dry-bag approach has in their benefit the high volume production due to the bag\nis built directly into the pressure cavity. In this technique, it is known that the flexible\nbag deforms but is not ejected. Two end plugs allow powder loading and component\nunloading on each cycle, without removing the bag assembly. Sealing is achieved by an\nupper punch that enters the bag before pressurization. In that situation, compaction\nstresses are generated by isostatic compression of the bag through a hydraulic fluid [2].\n\nIsostatic pressurization is useful for making large, thin-wall, long, or homogeneous\ncompacts. Density gradients are small in isostatically compacted components, allow-\ning large sintering shrinkages without distortion. With isostatic compaction, the fluid\nprovides uniform pressures and consequently, uniform density [2].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n2.Powder Compaction 13\n\n2.2.4 Powder Rolling\n\nAlthough die compaction is the most common process, powder rolling can be applied as\na first step toward full-density steel sheet. Powder rolling is different from the common\npowder compaction techniques because it is a continuous process. After the first stage of\ncompaction, in a rolling mill, the powder is not very dense. However, subsequent rolling\npasses improve density [2].\n\nLoose powder is gravity-fed into the gap between two rolls, which generate the green\nsheet. Gravity feed is the only effective means to feed powder, since there is no strength\nto the powder prior to rolling and green densities are very low. Figure 2.4 illustrates\na schematic operation. A binder can be added to improve green strength, and water\nworks for some powders. Two forces act on the powder as it is compressed. One is the\nnormal force from the rolls that give compaction, but the other is a tangential force from\nfriction between powder rolling. The compaction force must exceed the friction force in\npowder rolling. The allowed height reduction depends on the rotation angle from where\nthe powder first contacts the roll to the point at which full compression occurs. For\nsome powders this angle is as small as a few degrees [2].\n\nFigure 2.4: Powder rolling technique [6].\n\nThe higher the initial powder density and the greater the reduction in thickness on\nrolling, the higher the final density. However, powders with high apparent densities have\nless friction and undergo only small thickness reductions in rolling [2].\n\nIn a single-pass rolling operation, densities near theoretical have been achieved, but\nmultiple-pass treatments are more common. Obviously, the final product is limited\nto a sheet form. In the green state, the rolled powder is too weak to be coiled, so\nimmediate sintering is necessary. After the first sinter, repeated rolling and annealing\nallows fabrication of a full-density strip [2].\n\n2.3 Phenomenological Compaction Models\n\nThe phenomenological compaction models, originally developed for soils mechanics, are\nusually incremental continuum plasticity models (sometimes also called critical-state\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n14 2.Powder Compaction\n\nmodels) characterized by a yield criterion, an isotropic (or kinematic) hardening function\nand a flow rule. The latter is often considered as of associative that means the yield\nsurface and the plastic potential surface are coincident and, as a consequence, the plastic\nstrain increment is normal to the yield surface.\n\nThere are a large number of constitutive models for simulation of compaction, among\nthem the \u201dcap\u201d model and the Cam-Clay model. Not all can be described here, the\ndescription in section 2.3.1 focus on the most widely used model of phenomenological\ncompaction models, namely the Drucker-Prager/\u201dCap\u201d model.\n\n2.3.1 The Drucker-Prager Soil Plasticity Model\n\nThe original Drucker-Prager soil plasticity model was developed by Drucker and Prager\nin 1952. The main purpose of the model, was to modify the von Mises yield criterion in\nmetal plasticity to study the bearing capacity of soil foundations. While the metal plas-\nticity models are independent of the first stress invariant, particulate materials exhibit\nthe type of behaviour characterized by frictional materials in that the strength of these\nmaterials depends on hydrostatic stress. In the Drucker-Prager soil plasticity model is\nassumed that the material will behave elastically up at some point of stress at which\nyielding occurs. The shear stress necessary for yielding occurs depends in factors like\nthe cohesion of the material and the normal pressure on the failure surface [4].\n\nThe original Drucker-Prager yield criterion modified the von Mises yield criterion by\nintroducing a dependence on the mean (hydrostatic) stress, p. The Drucker-Prager yield\nfunction is given by:\n\nf(J1,J2D) =\n?\nJ2D ??1J1 ?k = 0, (2.1)\n\nwhere parameter J1 is the first stress invariant (J1 = ?ii = ?1 + ?2 + ?3), J2D is the\nsecond invariant of the deviatoric stress, sij\n\n(\nJ2D =\n\n1\n2\nsijsij\n\n)\n, and ?1 and k are positive\n\nmaterial constants [4].\n\nThe parameter ?1 allows modify the von Mises yield surface (which is plotted in\nthe principal stress space) from an infinitely long cylinder to a cone. This is why the\ncriterion is also called the extended von Mises criterion. When ?1 is major than zero,\nthe Drucker-Prager yield surface is a right circular cone with its axis equally inclined\nto the co-ordinate axes and its apex in the tension octant in the principal stress space.\nThe failure surface defined by the Drucker-Prager failure criterion in the principal stress\nspace and the meridional (p ? q) plane is demonstrated in figures 2.5 and 2.6. In the\nmeridional plane is shown that the parameters ?1 and k denote the angle of internal\nfriction and cohesion respectively [4].\n\nIn the original proposed Drucker-Prager, the failure surface is the straight edge of\na right circular cone, but some researchers have proposed that at higher stresses, the\nparticulate system behaves as a liquid and its strength approaches the von Mises surface\nat these stresses. Therefore, the failure surface can be composed by an initial portion of\nthe Drucker-Prager and then involves smoothly the subsequent von Mises surface that\nprescribes the strength of the material at 100% relative density as shown in figure 2.7\n[2].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n2.Powder Compaction 15\n\nFigure 2.5: Principal stress space [4].\n\nFigure 2.6: Meridional plane [4].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n16 2.Powder Compaction\n\nFigure 2.7: Proposed Drucker-Prager failure surface for higher stresses [4].\n\n2.3.2 Flow Rule\n\nWhen the state of stress reaches the yield criterion, the material undergoes plastic de-\nformation. For define the direction of the plastic strain vector, is established a flow\nrule. Q is a constant called plastic potential function that is assumed to exist and the\nincremental strain vectors are assumed to be orthogonal to this function as given:\n\nd?\npl\nij = ?\n\n?Q\n\n??ij\n, (2.2)\n\nwhere the parameter ? is a positive factor of proportionality [4]. This expression is\nreferred as the normality rule. In some cases, for several materials, the plastic potential\nfunction is assumed to be equal to the yield function. Such materials are said to follow\nthe associative flow rule of plasticity. Substituting the expression for the yield function\ndemonstrated at 2.1 in the normality rule 2.2, the new relation is given as:\n\nd?\npl\nij = ?\n\n(\nSij\n\n2\n?\nJ2D\n??1?ij\n\n)\n, (2.3)\n\nwhere Sij is the deviatoric stress tensor [4]. From equation 2.3, it is noted that the plastic\nrate of a cubical dilation is given by:\n\nd?\npl\nii = ?3?1?. (2.4)\n\nAs noted before, the volumetric component is negative indicating the shear failure\nalong the Drucker-Prager failure surface is accompanied by volume increase or dilation.\nHowever resorting to experimental data, it was concluded that in particulate materials\nthe dilation predicted by the Drucker-Prager model is usually larger than that found in\npractice. For some materials, the deformation occurs at constant volume or is accom-\npanied by a decrease in volume. This discrepancy may be due to an invalid assumption\nof the normality rule. Although discarding, the normality rule would imply a mate-\nrial that violates the stability postulates by Drucker (1950). Another consideration, for\nexplain the discrepancy could be due to the particulate material may not behave as a\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n2.Powder Compaction 17\n\nperfectly plastic body, an underling assumption of the failure surface definition. With\nall these presumptions and considerations it was presented the basis of the modified\nDrucker-Prager yield criterion with suggests treating the particulate material system as\na work-hardening material which could reach the perfectly plastic state [4].\n\n2.3.3 Work Hardening and Its Implications\n\nIn this section, the concept of work hardening is introduced for explaining the behaviour\nof material under plastic loading beyond its yield criterion but prior to failure. If an\nexternal agent causes added stresses on a body, work hardening of the material ensures\nthat the material remains in stable equilibrium by absorbing the work done by these\nadded stresses on the strains that result. The work hardening is based on two postulates\n[4]:\n\n1. During the application of stresses, the work done by the external agency will be\npositive. This is expressed mathematically as:\n\nd?ijd?ij > 0. (2.5)\n\n2. Over a cycle of application and removal of stresses, the work done by the external\nagency will be zero or positive. This is expressed as:\n\nd?ijd?\npl\nij ? 0. (2.6)\n\nCertain conditions need to be satisfied to grant an appropriate description of the\nphysical process involving plastic deformation for contemplate the conceit of work hard-\nening. These conditions were formulated by Prager (1949) and are [4]:\n\n1. Condition of continuity : Given a state of stress that is on the yield surface, an\ninfinitesimal change of stress d?ij causes unloading if the stress path is directed\nfor the interior of the surface and loading if the path is direct for the exterior of\nthe surface and for last, neutral loading if the stress path is tangential to the yield\nsurface. The condition of continuity states that neutral loading does not cause any\nplsatic deformation.\n\n2. Condition of uniqueness : This conditions denotes that for a given state of a ma-\nterial and a system of infinitesimal increments of surface tractions, the resulting\nincrements of stresses and strains are unique.\n\n3. Condition of irreversibility : This condition relates that plastic deformation are\nirreversible, this condition states that the work done on plastic deformation will\nbe positive.\n\n4. Condition of consistency : This condition determines that the yield condition is\nsatisfied as long the material stays in plastic state.\n\nConsidering the postulates and conditions mentioned above, is possible to study what\nthe implications of assuming a work hardening material are on yield surface. Suppose\nthat there is a stress state ? situated on the yield surface. Consider an infinitesimal\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n18 2.Powder Compaction\n\nincrement in stress d? whose stress path is directed towards the exterior of the yield sur-\nface as shown in figure 2.8. The incremental stress can be divided into two components:\na tangential component d?(t) and a normal component d?(n) [4].\n\nAssuming that the relation between the infinitesimal changes of stress and plastic\nstrain is linear, the incremental plastic strain caused by d? will be equal to the vector sum\nof the incremental plastic strains caused individually by d?(t) and d?(n). By imposing\nthe condition of continuity that requires the plastic strain due to neutral (or tangential)\nloading to be zero, is founded that the incremental plastic strain d?pl due to d? is\ndependent only on the normal component d?(n). This leaves to the normality rule i.e\nthe incremental strain vector is normal to the yield surface. Thus, it is concluded for\na work hardened, the yield function follows the normality rule and ensures that the\nmaterial is stable [4].\n\nFigure 2.8: Implication of work hardening [4].\n\nAnother topic of the condition of irreversibility is that the work done due to plastic\ndeformation is positive which is expressed as:\n\n? \u00b7 d?pl > 0 (2.7)\n\nor\n| ? | \u00b7 | d?pl | cos? > 0. (2.8)\n\nWith this, it is concluded that the radius vector should make an acute angle ? with\nthe incremental plastic strain vector. Although from the previous explanation, was seen\nit that the incremental plastic strain vector is normal to the yield surface. Thus, the\nconcept of work hardening and the condition of irreversibility requires the radius vector\nto make an accurate angle with an exterior normal to the yield surface. That is the yield\nsurface has to be convex. As a objective to describe the behaviour of particulate material\nas a work hardening material, Drucker and co-Workers defined a series of spherical yield\nsurfaces, the simplest convex surface possible. This concept of successive yield surfaces\ncan explain the hardening or consolidation behaviour of particulate materials and allow\nthe use of the normality rule of plasticity [4].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n2.Powder Compaction 19\n\n2.3.4 A Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap Model\n\nThe most used constitutive model in finite element simulation of compaction powder is\nthe so called cap model. The various cap models developed differ by the functional form\nyield surface but they all have some kind of cap describing the hardening part. The cap\nmodel first proposed by Drucker and co-Workers assumed the particulate material to\nbehave as a work hardening material that may approach the idealized perfectly plastic\nstate. It is considered the fact that many particulate materials experience the plastic\ndeformation even before reaching the ultimate failure state defined by the Drucker-\nPrager shear failure surface. This criterion also considers plastic deformations under\npure hydrostatic loading. In their work, Drucker presented the criterion proposing the\nyield curve being described by two straight lines that Drucker-Prager called the lines of\nthe failure criterion given by equation 2.1 and a circular arc closure corresponding to\nplacing a spherical cap on the open end of the cone as shown in figure 2.9. The spherical\nyield surface changes with the hydrostatic pressure to describe work hardening [4].\n\nIf the material is consolidate hydrostatically up to state of the stress A and then\nunloaded, so, the material will behave elastically until to state A and then start expe-\nriencing plastic deformations. During successive yielding, the material hardens. When\nthe stress point moves further the current yield surface as A, a new one yield surface\nis established at B. The region in which the material now behaves elastically will in-\ncorporate the sector OBD. The new yield surface at B intersects the Drucker-Prager\nfailure surface at D. The experimentally observed volumetric behaviour of particulate\nmaterials can be explained by assuming the incremental plastic strain vector to be nor-\nmal to the cap surface at its point of intersection. In addition, the incremental plastic\nstrain vector needs to be normal to the hydrostatic axis at the point of intersection to\nensure that no hardening takes place when the state of stress reaches a point on the yield\nsurface that is locally parallel to the hydrostatic axis since no plastic volumetric changes\noccur at such a point. This is equal to the critical state concept where the material does\nnot change in volume when reaches the critical state. For guaranteeing that no shear\ndeformations take place under pure hydrostatic compression, the cap surfaces intersects\nthe hydrostatic axis at right angles [4].\n\nFigure 2.9: Drucker-Prager cap yield surfaces [4].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n20 2.Powder Compaction\n\nDrucker and co-Workers proposed a spherical yield surface, the simplest convex yield\nsurface as required from the concept of work hardening. For different researchers, the\nshape of these yield surfaces has been assumed to be different. The shape of the yield\nsurface needs be determined from appropriate laboratory tests. Many caps models were\nsuggested all over the years by DiMaggio and Sandler (1971) and Lade (1977) where\nsuggests a series of elliptical yield surfaces. A yield function given by Chen (1994) is a\nsimple elliptical yield function referred to as the modified Drucker-Prager yield function\nand is expressed in equation 2.9 [4].\n\nf(J1,J2D,k1) = (J1 ? l)2 + R2J2D ? (x(k1) ? l)2 = 0 (2.9)\n\nThe parameter R represents the aspect ratio of the ellipse, l is the location of the\nintersection of the Drucker-Prager surface and the cap, and x is a hardening parameter\nand a function of k1 that defines the deformation history. This parameter k1 is usually\ntaken as the volumetric plastic strain [4].\n\nFigure 2.10: Modified Drucker-Prager cap model [4].\n\nThe hardening parameter that defines the yield surface represent a locus of points\nwith the same volumetric plastic strains. A series of cap yield surfaces defined by equa-\ntion 2.9 are shown in figure 2.10 that intersect Drucker-Prager failure surface as per the\nassumptions [4].\n\n2.3.5 Constitutive Model Parameters\n\nIn some commercial finite element programs the modified Drucker-Prager model is de-\nfined by three principal segments: a pressure-dependent Drucker-Prager shear failure\nsurface Fs, a series of compression yield surface Fc and a transition surface Ft like will\nbe described in section 6.4. With variation the cap along the hydrostatic axis it is de-\nfined the volumetric strain hardening. The purpose of the transition surface is to remove\nany singularities during numerical computations when moving from the yield surface to\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n2.Powder Compaction 21\n\nthe failure surface. The surfaces defined by the cap model described in ABAQUS in the\np?q or (J1/3 ?\n\n?\n3J2) plane is shown in figure 2.10 [4].\n\nThe hardening law is characterized by a piecewise linear function describing the\nhydrostatic yield surface pb to the volumetric plastic strain ?\n\nvol\npl as shown in figure 2.16,\n\n?volpl is the initial volumetric plastic strain beyond which the work hardening yield surfaces\nare defined [4].\n\nThe evolution parameter, pa is related to pb by equation 2.12 [4].\n\nCap Model Parameters\n\nThe Drucker-Prager/Cap model parameters can be characterized by identifying two\ndifferent aspects on the cap:\n\n?The plasticity parameters that describe the shape of the shear failure surface and the\nyield caps. Moreover, the plasticity parameters can be differentiated into two categories:\n\n? Failure surface parameters : These group of parameters responsible to define the\nshape of the shear failure surface. These two failure surfaces parameters are the\nmaterial cohesion or the intercept of the failure surface with the deviatoric stress\naxis, d, and the angle of internal friction or the slope of the failure surface with\nthe hydrostatic axis, ?.\n\n? Yield surface parameters : These parameters define the location and shape of the\nyield caps or loci of constant volumetric strain. The yield surface parameters\ncomprise the aspect ratio of the elliptic caps, R, and the location of the intersection\nof the cap surface with the shear failure surface.\n\n?The work hardening parameters that describe the evolution of the yield caps with\ncompaction. The location of intersection of the cap surface with the hydrostatic axis\nis prescribed by defining the work hardening parameter in terms of pairs of the hydro-\nstatic compression yield stress, pb, and volumetric plastic strain during the consolidation\nprocess, ?\n\npl\nvol.\n\nThe parameters are determined by doing some tests in a specimen made of a desired\nmaterial. Usually, the specimen is subjected to leading condition that would ensure that\nthe material is loaded to failure under shear as it undergoes compaction [4].\n\nFailure Surface Parameters\n\nThe failure surface parameters can be determined by performing a set of two or more\ntriaxial compression tests. These tests are made for determine the strength and the\nstress-strain relationships of a cylindrical specimen made of particulate material. At\na constant rate of axial deformation the specimen are isotropically consolidated and\nsheared in compression. Figure 2.11 shows a schematic of the triaxial test equipment\n[2].\n\nThe test apparatus consists of an axial loading device capable of providing a certain\nprescribed rate of axial strain on the specimen resorting to a piston. An axial measuring\ndevice incorporates the test apparatus. To measure the vertical deformation, a deforma-\ntion indicator is used for measure the displacement of the piston. A triaxial compression\nchamber consists in a top and a base plate separated by a cylindrical pressure vessel that\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n22 2.Powder Compaction\n\nis used to house the cylindrical specimen during tests. The chamber is constructed of\nany material capable of pressure controlling and measuring devices as well as a volume\nmeasuring device to measure the volumetric strain [4].\n\nFor the specimen reach the equilibrium at the effective consolidation pressure, the test\nstarts with the consolidation phase. The axial load piston is pull down and brought in\ncontact with the specimen and the reading of the deformation indicator is recorded. After\nrecording, the piston is raised a small distance and locked in place. The chamber pressure\nis then increased unit it reaches the desired effective consolidation. The specimen is then\nallowed and the volume readings are recorded at increasing intervals of time. The piston\nbegins the contact with the specimen cap, after a initial holding time period and then\naxial deformation is obtained along with the volume readings for the time increments.\nConsolidation is allowed to continue for at least one overnight period after 100% primary\nconsolidation has been achieved [4].\n\nFigure 2.11: Schematic of triaxial test apparatus [4].\n\nAfter the specimen be consolidated is then axially loaded at a constant confining\npressure to cause shear failure. The axial load piston is brought in contact with the\nspecimen and proper seating and alignment of the specimen with the piston is verified\nto prevent the applications of a lateral force on the piston. The specimen undergoes\nto an axial load at a desired rate of axial strain. The load and the deformation of the\nspecimen is recorded at increments of strain to define the stress-strain curve until the\nmaterial undergoes shear. Finished all this procedure the axial load is removed and the\npressure in the triaxial chamber is reduced to zero. The specimen is removed from the\nchamber and its size is measured [4].\n\nWith the objective to plot the shear failure line, a minimum of two triaxial compres-\nsion tests (i.e tests at two consolidation pressures) are sufficient. For get a better fit and\nreduce errors, the test is carried out at more than two consolidation pressures. Figure\n2.12 shows the typical results plotted from a triaxial test at different consolidation pres-\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n2.Powder Compaction 23\n\nsures (?3 = A,B,C,D,...) in order to the deviatoric stress against axial strain, ?1, and\nalso the shear failure surface plotted in the meridional plane by determining the failure\nstresses [4].\n\nFigure 2.12: Results of a set of triaxial compression tests [4].\n\nYield Surface Parameters\n\nThe cap eccentricity parameter is determined resorting to a true axial compression test.\nIt allows for the application of different stresses in the three orthogonal directions al-\nlowing for any loading path to be followed in the three-dimensional stress space. No\nstandard exists for the true triaxial compression test. The parameter can be determined\nby using a cylindrical triaxial compression test. With this test can carefully obtain differ-\nent loading paths leading to consolidation without shear the specimen. For realize these\ntriaxial tests is recommended use a cubical triaxial tester that allows for independent\nnormal loading to be applied in the three principal directions. In figure 2.13 it is shown\na schematic of a true triaxial test loading condition for a cubical triaxial tester [4].\n\nFigure 2.13: Schematic of a true triaxial test loading for cubical specimen [4].\n\nThe specimen powder is loaded into a flexible powder. The test is done considering\napplications of different stresses in the three orthogonal directions to allow consolidation\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n24 2.Powder Compaction\n\nof the specimen without shear. The three resulting principal stresses and the three\nprincipal logarithmic strain are measured during consolidation. During the consolidation\nthe bulk densities and the corresponding stress states are calculated. The initial mass\npowder placed into the cavity is known, so it is easily to calculate the relative density\nat any deformation state. For each value of ? obtained from the different stress states,\nthe equivalent pressure stress, p and deviatoric stress measure, q, are calculated as in\nexpressions 2.10 and 2.11 [4].\n\np = ?\n1\n\n3\n(?1 + ?2 + ?3) (2.10)\n\nq =\n\n?\n1\n\n2\n\n[\n(?1 ??2)2 + (?2 ??3)2 + (?1 ??3)2\n\n]\n(2.11)\n\nValues for p-q at different densities are plotted by using all the stress-strain curves\nobtained from the triaxial compression experiments. Thus, is possible to get yield sur-\nfaces or loci of constant volumetric strain (iso-density curves) as shown in figure 2.14.\nThe cap eccentricity parameter can be predicted by the aspect ratio of the best fit ellipse\nthrough these points.\n\nFigure 2.14: Iso-density curve representing Drucker-Prager yield caps in the p?q plane\n[4].\n\nHardening Parameter\n\nThe hardening parameter is applied in Drucker-Prager/cap model for define the harden-\ning law or the evolution of yield surfaces (caps) with increasing volumetric strains. The\nyield surfaces are loci of constant volumetric strain. The hardening law is defined by\na piecewise function relating the hydrostatic compression yield stress i.e, the intersec-\ntion of the yield surface with the hydrostatic axis, pb, and the volumetric plastic strain,\n?\n\npl\nvol. The hardening law is usually determined by a hydrostatic compression test (also\n\nknown as isotropic triaxial compression test). In this test the specimen is consolidated\nby loading it on a stress path along the space diagonal in the principal stress space with\nno shear [4].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n2.Powder Compaction 25\n\nThe hydrostatic compression test starts with the specimen at a initial isotropic state\nof stress, (p0 = ?0). The physical state corresponding at the beginning of the hydrostatic\ncompression is defined by the initial relative density, ?0. Next, the specimen begins\nconsolidation by loading it in increments of hydrostatic stress, i.e., by applying equal\nincrements of stress in the three orthogonal directions in a cubical triaxial tester. For\ncalculate the mean (hydrostatic) stress it is considered to measure the stress applied on\neach face of the cubical triaxial tester. The elastic strain is measured at each increment\nof the hydrostatic stress and is the sum of the three principal strains. Typically in this\ntype of testes the specimen is unload at various intervals during the test in order to\nobtain the bulk modulus for describing the elastic behaviour of the material. Then,\na graph can be plotted for describe the variation of hydrostatic stress with volumetric\nstrain as shown in figure 2.15. In this figure for example, the plot indicates that the\nspecimen was unloaded twice during the test. The hardening law can then be defined as\na piecewise function of the volumetric strain by fitting a function to the plotted data as\nshown in figure 2.16 [4].\n\nFigure 2.15: Hydrostatic stress versus volumetric strain [4].\n\nFigure 2.16: Hardening law [4].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n26 2.Powder Compaction\n\nLoading material with high strength, hydrostatically can be very difficult and the\nset-up expensive. Alternatively, it was adopted to test the material in a rigid die under\ncompaction loads for determine the hardening law. Figure 2.17 shows a schematic of a\nuniaxial die pressing set-up. The set-up consists of an axial loading punch with pressure\ntransducers mounted on it to measure the axial stress. Displacement transducers mea-\nsure the longitudinal displacement and hence the axial strain or relative bulk density of\nthe specimen [4].\n\nFigure 2.17: Schematic of a uniaxial die pressing experiment [4].\n\nThe die is considered be a rigid body, thus, the radial strain is assumed to be zero and\nthe plastic volumetric strain is assumed to be approximately equal to the total volumetric\nstrain since the elastic part of the volumetric strain is very small for high strength\nparticulate material. The effect of friction can be minimize by choosing appropriate\nlubricants at the die wall or admixed with particulate material. When the specimen\nparticulate material is loaded axially is measured, at the same time, the axial stress\nand the displacement for reunion data to give a plot of relative density versus axial\nstress. The hydrostatic compression stress, pb, is associated to the axial stress, ?z, by\nthe expression in 2.12 given by [4]:\n\npb =\n(1 + R.tan?) ?z\n\n1 + R.tan?\n\n?\n1 +\n\n(\n2\n\n3R\n\n)2 .

The bonding leads to improved strength and a lower\nsystem energy [7].\n\nSintering is a processing technique used to produce density-controlled materials and\ncomponents from metal or/and ceramic powders by applying thermal energy. The sin-\ntering process is a widely used processing technology in powder metallurgy and ceramics\nindustries [8]. During the sintering the green body undergoes the shrinkage in dimen-\nsions and then final high dense or full dense product is obtained [9]. Figure 3.1 shows\nthe general fabrication pattern of sintered part and in this specific chapter it will be\nfocus around the box named sintering.\n\nFigure 3.1: General fabrication pattern of sintered parts [9].\n\nSintering mechanisms can be divided into several types by means of mass transport\nmechanisms largely occurring at the atomic level. Most polycrystalline materials are\nsintered through solid-state diffusion that falls into solid-state sintering. Most sintering\ncycles generate a transient liquid phase that can improve the mass transport rate. It\nis called liquid-state sintering. For amorphous materials, viscous flow is the main mass\ntransport mechanism during the process considered as viscous sintering [9].\n\nSintering aims is, in general, to produce sintered parts with reproducible and if\npossible, designed microstructure through control of sintering variables. Microstructural\n\n27\n\n\n\n28 3.Sintering\n\ncontrol means the control of grain size, sintered density, and size and distribution of\nother phases including pores. In most cases, the final goal of microstructural control is\nto prepare a fully dense body with a fine grain structure [9].\n\n3.2 Definitions and Nomeclature\n\n3.2.1 Density and Porosity\n\nDensity is the most widely reported property in sintering. It relates to the sintering\nkinetics and correlates with many properties of sintered materials. The density (?)\nis the mass per unit volume, which is called the absolute density (Mg/m3 or g/cm3).\nHere, the concern is lead with the fractional or percentage density that gives evidence of\nfundamental events occurring during sintering, independent of the material. It is defined\nas the measured density divided by the theoretical density. In fact, when work with\npowder structures, the compact density is often expressed as a fractional of percentage\nof theoretical solid density, designated Vs for the volume fraction of solid phase; thus\nVs = ?/?T, where ?T is the theoretical density for the material. Alternatively, the volume\nfraction of porosity Vp is the fractional void space in the compact, where Vp = (1??)/?T.\nBy definition the fractional porosity equal unit, as given by [7]:\n\nVp + Vs = 1. (3.1)\n\nThe green density refers to the before sintering, so the green porosity is the void\nspace prior to sintering. Theoretical density corresponds to the pore-free solid sintering\n[7].\n\nPores are an inherent part of sintering. They are present in the powder compact\nas interparticle voids. The pores space is characterized by its amount, size, shape, and\ndistribution throughout the compact. As the particles sinter, often the compacts densify\nand reduce the pore size [7].\n\nPorosity, a gross measure of the pore structure, gives the fraction of the total volume\nthat is void. It is expressed as either a percentage or fraction of the total volume [7].\n\n3.2.2 Shrinkage and Swelling\n\nThe dimensional change in a powder compact is one of the most widely applied sintering\nmonitors. Shrinkage refers to a decrease in linear dimensions, and swelling refers to an\nincrease in dimensions. Although in many situations sintering is intentionally performed\nto bond particles without significant dimensional change, there are a great many situa-\ntions that exhibit shrinkage or swelling. In such situations there is considerable concern\nwith controlling shrinkage or swelling to obtain the desired final dimensions [7].\n\nFormally, the linear dimensional change is defined as ?L/L0, reflecting the change\nin an initial green length L0 to a final sintered length Ls given as ?L. If the dimension\nis larger after sintering, the process termed swelling and ?L/L0 is positive, while if\nthe dimension is smaller after sintering the process is termed shrinking and ?L/L0 is\nnegative [7].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n3.Sintering 29\n\n3.2.3 Coarsening and Densification\n\nMany materials form sinter bonds between particles without densification. This is usually\ndue to transport from surface sites to surface sites by surface diffusion or evaporation-\ncondensation. Even thought there is no net dimensional change, there is considerable\nreduction of surface area, increase in grain size, and compact strengthening, with atten-\ndant changes in the pore size and shape. These are termed coarsening events and are\nbest monitored by surface area, grain size, or pore size parameters. Coarsening processes\nalso consume the surface energy that is responsible for densification, but do not reduce\npore space. In these situations densification requires manipulation to minimize coarsen-\ning. It is common to observe sintering with simultaneous densification and coarsening.\nThere are sintered products where lack of densification is desirable. Alternatively, den-\nsification is desirable in many structural materials. During coarsening the pores grow\nwhile during densification the pores shrink. In many cases this mixture of densification\nand coarsening leads to growth of the large pores and shrinkage of the smaller pores [7].\nFigure 3.5 illustrates the scenario that it is possible for both coarsening and densification\neffects to exist.\n\n3.2.4 Sintering stress\n\nThe Laplace equation expresses the stress ? associated with a curved surface as:\n\n? = ?\n\n(\n1\n\nR1\n+\n\n1\n\nR2\n\n)\n, (3.2)\n\nwhere ? is the surface energy, and R1 and R2 are the principal radii of curvature for the\nsurface. Figure 3.2 illustrates a general point on a curved surface and the two radii R1\nand R2. A flat surface is stress free. During sintering, any surface with a bump, or dip,\nwill tend to flatten over time to remove the stress [7].\n\nFigure 3.2: Curvature at any point on a curved surface is given in terms of the two\nprincipal radii R1 and R2 [7].\n\nAs an example of Laplace equation usage, consider the initial sintering of two spheres.\nThe neck region can be simplified as drawn in figure 3.3. A free surface is characterized\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n30 3.Sintering\n\nby disrupted atomic bonding, which is the source of the surface energy, and the grain\nboundary also a defective region (which is the source of the grain boundary energy).\nInitial atomic bounding in the neck region is highly disrupted. Along the surface away\nfrom the neck, the curvature is constant, with both R1 and R2 equal to the sphere radius,\nD/2. From equation 3.3.\n\nFigure 3.3: Sintering profile for two spherical particles with neck diameter of X [7].\n\n? =\n4?\n\nD\n(3.3)\n\nUsing a circle approximation to the neck shape with a radius of p, where p is approx-\nimately equal to X2/4D, the curvature at the neck gives a stress as follows:\n\n? = ?\n\n(\n2\n\nX\n?\n\n4D\n\nX2\n\n)\n. (3.4)\n\nComparing 3.3 and 3.4 reveals that there is a large stress gradient in the neck re-\ngion, since the stress changes sign over a relatively small distance. For a small neck\nthe gradient can be quite large. Thus, the stress gradient provides a driving force for\nmass flow to the neck. As the neck grows, the curvature gradient is relaxed and the\nprocess is slow. In the intermediate stage, the curvature around the cylindrical pores\nprovides the driving force. Alternatively, in the final stage, the curvature around the\nspherical pores drives shrinkage. A reduction in surface energy occurs either by removal\nof the pores or coalescence of the pores - hence the focus on densification and coarsening\nduring sintering. Similarly, the particles bond and become grains. Grain growth during\nsintering reduces the grain boundary area and energy. The stress from interfacial ener-\ngies acting over curved surfaces in a sintering system is termed the sintering stress. In\na sense, the sintering stress results from equating the thermodynamic work associated\nwith eliminating surface energy (and area) to mechanical work [7].\n\nThe sintering stress is associated directly with the curvature at the interparticle neck.\nBy the final stage, the sintering stress takes on two contributions, one attributed to the\npores and the second attributed to the grain:\n\n? =\n2?ss\nG\n\n+\n4?sv\ndp\n\n, (3.5)\n\nwhere G is the grain size, ?ss is the solid-solid grain boundary energy, ?sv is the\nsolid-vapor surface energy, and dp is the pore size. At small grain sizes the first term is\ndominant, while at small pore sizes the second term is dominant [7].\n\nDensification increases with the sintering stress, which in turn varies with tempera-\nture [7].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n3.Sintering 31\n\n3.3 Categories of Sintering\n\nEssentially, sintering processes can be divided into two types: solid state sintering and\nliquid phase sintering. Solid state sintering occurs when the powder compact is densified\nwholly in a solid state at the sintering temperature, while liquid phase sintering occurs\nwhen a liquid phase is present in the powder compact during sintering. Figure 3.4,\nin a representative mode, illustrates the two cases in a schematic phase diagram. At\ntemperature T1, solid state sintering occurs in an A?B powder compact with composition\nX1, while at temperatures T3, liquid phase sintering occurs in the same powder compact\n[8].\n\nFigure 3.4: Illustration of various types of sintering [8].\n\nOther types of sintering phases exists between solid state sintering and liquid phase\nsintering, which are for example, transient liquid phase sintering and viscous flow sin-\ntering. Viscous flow sintering occurs when the volume fraction of liquid is sufficiently\nhigh, so that the full densification of the compact can be achieved by a viscous flow of\ngrain-liquid mixture without having any grain shape change during densification. In the\ntransient liquid phase sintering, a combination of liquid phase sintering and solid state\nsintering occurs. In this sintering technique a liquid phase forms in the compact at an\nearly stage of sintering, but the liquid disappears as sintering proceeds and densification\nis completed in the solid state. Resorting again to figure 3.4, it can be observed an\nexample of transient liquid phase sintering when an A ? B powder compact with com-\nposition X1 is sintered above the eutectic temperature but below a solidus line AB, for\nexample at temperature T2. Since the sintering temperature is above the A?B eutectic\ntemperature, a liquid phase is formed through the reaction between the A and B powders\nduring heating of the compact. During sintering however, the liquid phase disappears\nand only a solid phase remains because the equilibrium phase under the given sintering\ncondition is a solid phase [8].\n\nIn general, liquid phase sintering allows easy control of microstructure and reduction\nin processing cost, but degrades some important properties, like mechanical properties,\nwhen compared with solid state sintering. Liquid phase sintering is applied when speci-\nfied products utilize properties of the grain boundary phase [8].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n32 3.Sintering\n\n3.4 Sintering Variables\n\nIt is convenient to identify the major variables that influence the sintering stage. So,\nthe major variables which determine sinterability and the sintered microstructure of\na powder compact can be divided into two categories: material variables and process\nvariables (table 3.1) [8].\n\nTable 3.1: Variables affecting sinterability and microstructure [8].\nVariables related to raw materials Powder:\n(material variables) shape, size, size distribution, agglomeration,\n\nmixedness, etc.\nChemistry:\ncomposition, impurity, non-stoichiometry, ho-\nmogeneity, etc.\n\nVariables related to sintering condition Temperature, time, pressure, atmosphere,\n(process variables) heating and cooling, etc.\n\nThe variables connected to raw materials (material variables) include chemical com-\nposition of powder compact, powder size, powder shape, powder size distribution, degree\nof powder agglomeration, etc. These variables influence the powder compressibility and\nsinterability (densification and grain growth). The other variables involved in sintering\nare mostly thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, time, atmosphere, pressure,\nheating and cooling rate [8].\n\n3.5 Driving Force and Basic Phenomena\n\nThe driving force of sintering is the reduction of the total interfacial energy [8]. The\nimpetus to reduce the total interfacial energy is considered as the sintering driving force,\nthat includes the force associated to the curvature of the particle surfaces the externally\napplied pressure and the chemical reactions [9]. The total interfacial energy of a powder\ncompact is expressed as ?A, where ? is the specific surface (interface) energy and A the\ntotal surface (interface) area of the compact. The reduction of the total energy can be\nexpressed as:\n\n? (?A) = ??A + ??A (3.6)\n\nwhere the change in interfacial energy (??) is due to densification and the change in\ninterfacial area due to grain coarsening. For solid state sintering ?? is related to the\nreplacement of solid/vapour interfaces (surface) by solid/solid interfaces. The scheme\npresented in figure 3.5 shows that the reduction in total interfacial energy occurs via\ndensification and grain growth, the basic phenomena of sintering [8].\n\n3.6 Sintering Mechanism\n\nThere are many types of transport mechanism occurring during the sintering process.\nFigure 3.6 illustrates the paths of material transport of the transport mechanics listed in\ntable 3.2. The material transport due to the difference in interface curvature occurs under\nthe parallel actions of various mechanisms. Some of these material transport mechanisms\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n3.Sintering 33\n\nFigure 3.5: Basic phenomena occurring during sintering under the driving force for\nsintering, ? (?A) [8].\n\ncontribute to densification and shrinkage while others do not [8]. The vacancies and\natoms move along the particle surfaces (surface diffusion), along the grain boundaries\n(grain boundary diffusion), across pore spaces (evaporation-condensation), and through\nthe lattice interior (volume diffusion or lattice diffusion or viscous flow) [9].\n\nTable 3.2: Material transport mechanisms during sintering [8].\n\nMaterial transport mechanism Material source Material\nsink\n\nRelated parameter\n\nLattice diffusion Grain boundary Neck Lattice diffusivity,\nDl\n\nGrain bounday diffusion Grain boundary Neck Grain boundary dif-\nfusivity, Db\n\nViscous flow Bulk grain Neck Viscosity, ?\nSurface diffusion Grain surface Neck Surface diffusivity,\n\nDs\nLattice diffusion Grain surface Neck Lattice diffusivity,\n\nDl\nGas phase transport\n\nEvaporation/Condensation Grain surface Neck Vapour pressure dif-\nference, ?p\n\nGas diffusion Grain surface Neck Gas diffusivity, Dg\n\nFrom figure 3.6, it can be illustrated that densification occurs only when the atoms\nmove along the grain boundaries and create the continual mass flow into the pores.\nThe center of the particles move closer through diffusion, that leads to the macroscopic\nshrinkage of the sintering bodies. So, grain boundary diffusion and volume diffusion con-\ntribute to densification. On the other hand, surface diffusion, evaporation-condensation\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n34 3.Sintering\n\nare the coarsening mechanisms that occur without producing densification [9].\n\nFigure 3.6: Material transport paths during sintering [9].\n\n3.7 Stages of Solid State of Sintering\n\nSolid state sintering is usually divided into three overlapping stages: intial; intermediate\nand final stage. Figure 3.7 demonstrates the typical densification curve of a compact for\nthese stages over sintering time [8]. There is no clear-cut distinction between the stages,\nbut each stage can be described by its general characteristics, as shown in figure 3.8 [9].\n\nFigure 3.7: Densification curve behaviour of a powder compact through the three sin-\ntering stages [8].\n\nThe initial stage is characterized by the loose particles rearranging their positions to\nform new contacts with each other. Afterwards, the sintering necks are formed at the\ncontact area and begin to grow by the diffusion process. The initial stage ends when the\nneck radius is around 0.3 of the radius of the particle and compact shrinkage is limited\nto 2?3% at most. The intermediate stage is the most important for densification, since\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n3.Sintering 35\n\n(a) Loose pow-\nder at the begin-\nning of sintering\n\n(b) Neck forma-\ntion and growth\nin the initial\nstage\n\n(c) Intercon-\nnected pores in\nthe intermediate\nstage\n\n(d) Isolated\npores and grain\ngrowth in the\nfinal stage\n\nFigure 3.8: Microstructure evolution in PIM sintering involving [9].\n\nit determines the properties of the sintering components. Considerable densification, up\nto ? 93% of the relative density, occurs before isolation of the pores. The final stage\nis characterized by the isolated pores located at the grain corners. It is also known as\nthe coarsening involving growth of the larger grains and the consumption of the smaller\ngrains. For the ideal cylindrical pores occupying the grain boundaries, instability occurs\nat approximately 8% of the porosity. Considering the porosity distributions of the real\nmaterials, the pores begin to close at about 15% of the porosity and are all closed when\nthe porosity is less than 5% [9].\n\n3.8 Models of Initial Stage\n\nThe microscopic models are established from the particles level. If spherical particles\nof the same size are assumed, the sintering of powder compacts can be represented as\nthe sintering between two particles, the two-particle model [8]. The two-particle model\nis the typical one used to simulate the neck growth and the densification during the\ninitial sintering stage [9]. The typical geometries of the two-particle models are shown\nin figure 3.9, one without shrinkage (a) and the other with shrinkage (b). In figure 3.9\nthe distance between the particles does not change but the neck size increases as the\nsintering time increases [8]. In the model with shrinkage, the neck size increases with an\nincreased sintering time by material transport between the particles and hence shrinkage\nresults [9].\n\n3.9 Intermediate and Final Stage Sintering\n\nWhen necks form between particles in real powder compacts, pores form interconnected\nchannels along 3-grain edges. As the sintering progresses, the pore channels are discon-\nnected and isolated pores form and, at the same time, the grains grow [8].\n\nCoble presented two geometrically simple models for the shape changes of pores\nduring intermediate and final stage sintering: the channel pore model and the isolated\npore model, respectively [9].\n\nIn the intermediate stage, the geometry of the grain is regarded as tetrakaidecahedron\nand the highly interconnected pores are assumed to be cylindrical ones located at the\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n36 3.Sintering\n\nFigure 3.9: Geometrical description of the two-sphere particle model to describe the\nneck growth and densification in the initial state of sintering (a) without shrinkage; (b)\nwith shrinkage [9].\n\ngrain boundaries [9], as shown in figure 3.10 (a).\nAs a geometrical model of final stage sintering Coble took tetrakaidecahedral grains\n\nwith spherical pores with a radius of r1 at their corners, as shown in 3.10 (b).\n\n(a) Intermediate Stage Sin-\ntering\n\n(b) Final Stage Sintering\n\nFigure 3.10: Coble\u2019s geometrical models [8].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nGrain Growth\n\nIt is important to present an overview about grain growth, being intimately connected\nwith the sintering cycle. Figure 4.1 demonstrates the formation of two elongated grains\nfrom six original particles where the grain behaviour with higher temperatures is shown\n[10]. It is these phenomenons occurring at higher temperatures that are interesting to\napproach in the context of this study.\n\nThe average grain size of polycrystalline materials increases as the annealing time\nincrease and the phenomenon of grain growth is important in sintering. Phenomeno-\nlogically, grain growth is divided into two types: normal and abnormal (sometimes also\ncalled exaggerated) grain growth. Normal grain growth is characterized by a simple and\ninvariable distribution of relative grain size with annealing time, while abnormal grain\ngrowth, which occurs by the formation of some exceptionally large grains in a matrix,\nshows a bimodal grain size distribution [8].\n\nGrain size influences many mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials [11].\nIn the case of metallic and ceramic systems are exposed to elevated temperatures, it\ngenerally results in grain growth with a simultaneous loss in strength and fractures\ntoughness [12]. Grain growth and deformation are similar in one respect; both involve\nmovement and rearrangement of atoms [11].\n\nIn sintering, grain growth reduces the number of diffusion vacancy sinks, which re-\nsults in a decrease densification rate. Some studies revealed that stainless steel powder\ncompact showed an intimate relation between grain growth and densification processes.\nThe effect was particularly dominant in the intermediate stage of sintering in which the\npore structure became rounded, usually when temperatures reach values above 1057 ?C\nand for periods superior to one hour [12].\n\n4.1 Grain Boundary Diffusion in Sintering\n\nIn grain boundary diffusion dominated by sintering processes, the sintering stress is\nproportional to the reciprocal of grain size. It is this relation that connects the macro-\nscale deformation with the microstructure evolution of the material [1].\n\nGrain boundary diffusion is a mass flow mechanism used to describe the solid state\nsintering of many materials during their densification. Grain boundaries form in the in-\nterface between crystals with different atomic orientations. Essentially, grain boundary\ndiffusion consists of lattice defects between grains. Corresponding to large and small\n\n37\n\n\n\n38 4.Grain Growth\n\nFigure 4.1: Diagram illustrating grain growth in cluster of particles by surface diffusion.\nArrows on grain boundaries indicate direction of boundary movement [10].\n\nrotation angles between adjacent grains, the misorientation could be random and re-\npeated, respectively. Therefore, a grain boundary is as narrow as a crystallite, usually\nin a scale of nanometer. However, it is still an efficient mass flow path [1].\n\nThe influence of grain boundary diffusion on sintering is dependent on several factors:\nthe grain shape, the grain size, and the distribution [1].\n\n4.2 Grain Growth Mechanism\n\nGrain growth is the process in which the average grain size of an aggregate of crystals\nincreases. It is driven by the decrease in surface energy and reduction in the total grain\nboundary area. Grain growth is closely related to the migration of the grain boundary.\nFor continuous materials, depending on the microstructure character and growth pattern,\ntwo different types of grain growth have been reported in previous studies: abnormal\ngrain growth (discontinuous) and normal grain growth (continuous). Abnormal grain\ngrowth normally commences after a certain period of normal grain growth. Abnormal\ngrain growth occurs at temperatures below 0.7Tm to 0.9Tm, where Tm is the melting\npoint. When abnormal grain growth (AGG) occurs, most of the grain boundaries are\nfound to have faceted structures [1]. Abnormal grain growth is a coarsening type of\nmicrostructure where some (or a few) large grains grow unusually quickly in a matrix\nof fine grains with a very slow growth rate [8]. Therefore, the average of the grain size\ndistribution is not changing significantly. When normal grain growth occurs, faceted\ngrain boundaries are replaced with smoothly curved shapes and the grain growth speed\nincreases dramatically despite the initial grain size [1].\n\nIf the activation energy for grain growth is high, grain growth may not be very fast\nand neither is the sintering densification. It has been noted that, as the temperature\ngets to a transition point, the activation energy may shift to a different level, which\ncauses an immediate increase of grain size. As the grain grows bigger, the growth rate\nbecomes slower. Ultimately, the resistance and the driving force may reach a balance\npoint. According to these observations, it is reasonable to conclude that a transition\ntemperature exists for grain growth of continuous material. This transition temperature\ndefines the boundary between abnormal grain growth and normal grain growth, and also\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n4.Grain Growth 39\n\nthe shift between the two energy levels [1].\n\nFigure 4.2: Normal grain growth (continuous) and abnormal grain growth (discontinu-\nous) [13].\n\nConsidering the fact that even the smallest pore in a powder compact is much larger\nthan the width of a grain boundary or the size of a dislocation, which is around several\nnanometres, it is reasonable to believe that the grain growth behaviour in a porous body\nis the same as it is in a full-dense body [1].\n\nThe grain growth behaviour occurs approximately in the final of the initial stage\nof sintering and continues into the intermediate stage. This behaviour is represented\nin scheme 4.3. Neck growth occurs between two spheres of slightly different size in\ncontact; the grain boundary which develops as a consequence of the misorientation of\nthe spheres at the contact interface (Figure 4.3 (b)) cannot migrate from the neck region\nbecause increases in interfacial area and total interfacial energy would be required. The\nneck disappears with further growth by varying transport mechanisms, which are for\nexample, surface, grain boundary, and volume diffusion, leaving only a thermal groove\nat the grain boundary (Figure 4.3 (c)). The grain boundary becomes curved. The larger\nthe difference in size between the initial particles, the greater will be the curvature of the\ngrain boundary which develops. Grain-boundary curvature creates a driving force such\nthat the boundary migrates toward its center of curvature. Grain-boundary migration\noccurs when the boundary is mobile enough to permit ions to move across it. Subsequent\ngrain growth is evidenced by an elongated grain (figure 4.3 (d)) [10].\n\nThus, grain growth in porous compacts consists of growth of necks between parti-\ncles until the grain boundary is free to move. Grain-boundary motion is probably fast\ncompared to neck growth, and after the neck reaches a size comparable to that of the\nsmaller grain, the boundary will move rapidly through the smaller grain. During grain\ngrowth the grain will either grow or disappear, depending on the size of its immediate\nneighbour [10].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n40 4.Grain Growth\n\n(a) Particles of\nslightly different\nsize in contact\n\n(b) Neck growth\nbetween con-\ntacting particles\n\n(c) Grain\nboundary mi-\ngration away\nfrom contact\nplane\n\n(d) Grain\ngrowth\n\nFigure 4.3: Qualitative mechanism of grain growth in porous compact [10].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nConstitutive Models\n\n5.1 Thermal Expansion\n\nIn most cases, the main reason for heat absorption is the atoms vibrational energy\nincrease, and consequently, volume changes. In the absence of phase transformation,\nmost materials show positive heat expansion coefficient (?), i.e., they increase their\ndimension with an increase in temperature. Consequently, a material subjected to a\nthermal gradient, will suffer a thermal strain, resulting in thermal dilation. The stain\n(?T) is given by:\n\n??T = ?L?T, (5.1)\n\nwhere ?L is the linear thermal expansion coefficient and ?T is the temperature variation\n[14].\n\n5.2 Heat transport\n\nThe sintering atmosphere determines several reactions during sintering. Additionally,\nthe atmosphere is important in transporting heat to the compact [7].\n\nThere are three ways to transfer heat: conduction, convection, and radiation. Radi-\nation occurs by the emission of light or other electromagnetic radiation from the furnace\nwalls or heating elements. Convection and conduction require a gas phase. Conduction\nis heat transport through the gas, based on thermal conductivity of the material, like\nis explained in 5.2.1. Convection is also through the gas, but depends further on the\nvelocity of the gas at the compact surface and is discussed in 5.2.2 [7].\n\nOnce heat is deposited at the compact surface, there is then the necessity to distribute\nthe heat into the compact. This depends on the thermal conductivity, porosity, and gas\nphase. Usually, pores reduce the thermal conductivity for a material. Usually in most\nmaterials, the temperature difference between the surface and the interior is small during\nsintering [15].\n\n5.2.1 Thermal Conductivity\n\nThermal conductivity is the property that quantifies the material capability to transport\nthe heat from the high temperature zones to lower temperature zones (heat conduction).\nThe heat conduction is the transmission of energy from particles in an elevated state\n\n41\n\n\n\n42 5.Constitutive Models\n\nenergy to particles in a lower state energy, in order for each particle to be in a lower\nenergy state [14].\n\nThe mathematical model usually applied to quantify the heat conduction is called\nthe Fourier law, which establishes that the heat flux by conduction in a certain direction\nis proportional to the normal area, to the considered direction and to the temperature\nin the analysed direction given by:\n\nQ = ?KA\ndT\n\ndx\n, (5.2)\n\nwhere K is the thermal conductivity of the material. The negative signal present on the\nrelation is in consequence of the heat flux direction being opposite to the temperature\ngradient [14].\n\nThe heat conduction through the compact is not a large problem under normal\nheating rates. Only with large compacts, rapid heating, or high initial porosities will\nthere be opportunities to generate large surface stresses that might cause cracking [7].\n\n5.2.2 Convection\n\nConvection is a commitment between two mechanisms that allow heat exchange. The\natomic and the macroscopic movements contribute to the heat exchange. The heat\nexchange only happens if the material and the surrounding environment are at different\ntemperatures, i.e, distinct energy levels. This exchange ends when the two systems\ninvolved reach an equilibrium state. The mathematical model most used to quantify this\nheat exchange is the Newton cooling law. This law says that the convection heat flux\nin a determined direction is proportional to the normal area to the considered direction\nand to the difference in temperatures. The proportionality constant is the convection\nheat flux (h) included in equation 5.3 [14].\n\nqc = hc (Ts ?T?) (5.3)\n\n5.2.3 Radiation\n\nThe radiation heat flux exchanged with the surrounding environment can be given by:\n\nqr = kr (Ts ?T?) , (5.4)\n\nwhere kr = ?r\n(\nT 2s + T\n\n2\n?\n)\n\n(Ts + T?) and ?r is the constant dependent of Stefan-Boltzman\nand the emissivity of the material, considering that the green body is inserted in a closed\ncavity [16].\n\n5.2.4 Temperature distribution\n\nAll the materials have the capability to transfer the heat from higher temperature regions\nfor lower temperature regions. During the heat transfer, there is the formation of thermal\ngradients and then, the necessity of quantifying them in time and space. In an analysis of\nheat conduction, it is important to try to identify the temperatures field in a specimen,\naccording to the engaging environment. Therefore, it considered an infinitesimal volume\nelement and a thermal balance into this element is applied, resulting in relation 5.5.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n5.Constitutive Models 43\n\nE?Stored = E?In ? E?Out + E?Generated (5.5)\n\nConsidering the Fourier law and the non-existent phase change, a differential equa-\ntion that allows the temperatures distribution calculations in function of time and space\n(T(x,y,z,t)) is established. This is usually known as heat diffusion equation, which, de-\nspite its complexity, is very important in heat conduction transient analysis [14]. Math-\nematically, this differential equation is expressed as:\n\n?Cp\n?T\n\n?t\n=\n\n?\n\n?x\n\n(\nKx\n\n?T\n\n?x\n\n)\n+\n\n?\n\n?y\n\n(\nKy\n\n?T\n\n?y\n\n)\n+\n\n?\n\n?z\n\n(\nKz\n\n?T\n\n?z\n\n)\n, (5.6)\n\nwhere ? is the density, Cp is the heat capacity and Kx, Ky and Kz represent the thermal\nconductivity in, respectively, the x, y and z directions [14].\n\n5.3 Thermo-mechanical behaviour\n\nWhen a certain material is subjected to a transform process, like what happens in\npowder metallurgy process, this one stays subjected to a mechanical and thermal residual\nstresses from the themo-mechanical effects. Therefore, it becomes relevant to study and\nto analyse the rheological behaviour of the material, i.e., the mechanisms that deform\nthe material when subjected to effects.\n\nIt is necessary to point out that this process is an uncoupled process, i.e., in this\nwork there are two distinct processes. The first part, of this work, is focused on the\ncompaction process and the second part is focused on the sintering process. The two\nprocesses have distinct behaviours but when together, the powder metallurgy process\nemerges, which is controlled by a thermo-mechanical behaviour.\n\nDifferent materials can present different mechanical behaviours, and they are clas-\nsified according to their behaviour. In this work the isotropic material behaviour is\nadopted, mainly, to explain the deformation in the compaction process. The isotropic\nmaterial has uniform characteristics in all directions, i.e., it presents symmetric proper-\nties relatively to a plane with arbitrary direction [14].\n\n5.3.1 Strain Components\n\nIn this research, the strains created come from the compaction and sintering processes.\nThus, velocities or strain rates can be divided into elastic (?e) and plastic (?p) that are\nessentially from the compaction stage and also elastic strain (?e), creep strain (?cr) and\nthermal strain (?t), essentially coming from sintering stage\n\nIn a industrial transformation process of a loose powder into a hard metal it occurs\nthe development of the previously referred strains, which will be properly described.\n\n5.3.2 Strain components from powder compaction\n\nStarting by considering the simple case of uniaxial compression of a block material\nand identifying some elementary features of the material response and how this will\nbe presented in the form of a material constitutive model, the next step is generalise\nthe results to describe the response of porous powder compacts subjected to general\nmultiaxial stress histories [17].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n44 5.Constitutive Models\n\nConsider, initially, the situation where a cylindrical specimen of a material is sub-\njected to a uniaxial stress ? and as a result experiences a strain ?. Figure 5.1 shows a\ntypical material response [17].\n\nAt low stress occurs the elastic strain, which corresponds to the simultaneous happen-\ning of applied force with respective strain, considering this phenomena time dependent.\nIf the relation between the applied force and displacement is linear, the material be-\nhaviour is elastic linear. The material elastic behaviour could be interpreted resorting\nto an analogy with a spring. When a load is applied into a spring, this one deforms.\nHowever, the load necessary for increasing the strain also increases. At the end, when\nthe load is removed, the spring returns to their initial state naturally. This kind of\nbehaviour could be defined by Hooke\u2019s law. He says that the stress is the product of the\nelasticity module by the respectively strain [17], like shown in Equation 5.7.\n\n?e = E?e (5.7)\n\nAs the stress is increased the material eventually yields and plastic strain accu-\nmulates. The plastic strain works as a non reversible process. Any plastic strain is\npermanent and the strain stays in the body after unload. The calculation methodology\nlike Hooke\u2019s law loses their influence. In this case, the process is time dependent and\nchange the materials behaviour, in such manner, that their mechanical characteristics\ncome to depend on the history material loads [14]. Figure 5.1 shows the situation where\nthe specimen is loaded beyond the initial yield stress, ?s, to a stress ? = s. If the stress\nis now reduced to zero the specimen unloads elastically. The residual plastic strain\naccumulated as a result of this loading history is ?p. If the stress is increased to the\nvalue ? &lt;s, the subsequent response is elastic and the total strain experienced by the\nspecimen [17] is given by 5.8.\n\n? = ?e + ?p =\n?\n\nE\n+ ?p (5.8)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 5.1: Stress-strain curves for an elastoplsatic material, showing the decomposition\nof the strain into elastic and plastic components [17].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n5.Constitutive Models 45\n\nIf the stress is increased to the point ? = s further plastic straining can occur. The\nmagnitude of s is important since, it gives the value of stress at which the response is no\nlonger elastic, i.e, it is the instantaneous magnitude of the yield stress that results from\nprior thermomechanical loading history. It is evident that s (the yield stress) depends\non the accumulated plastic strain, i.e, s is a function of ?p [17].\n\nFocus now in the deformation situation under multiaxial states of stress, where the\ncompacts are subjected to axisymmetric loading histories, such as shown in figure 5.2,\nin which a cylindrical compact is subjected to axial and radial components of stress, ?a\nand ?r [17].\n\nThe hydrostatic component of stress is the mean of the three principal stresses (there\nare two radial components) and for the axisymmetric stress state of figure 5.2 [17] is given\nby:\n\np =\n1\n\n3\n(?a + 2?r) . (5.9)\n\nThe equivalent stress is related to the principal shear stresses and for the loading of\nfigure 5.2 [17] is given by:\n\nq = |?a ??r|. (5.10)\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 5.2: Axial and radial components of (a) stress and (b) strain on an axisymmetric\npowder compact [17].\n\nUnder the axisymmetric loading of figure 5.2 (a) the compact experiences axial and\nradial strains, ?a and ?r, as show figure 5.2 (b). Considering again elastic response,\nit proves convenient to define two strain invariants: the volumetric strain, ?v, and the\nequivalent strain ?e, for the axisymmetric conditions of figure 5.2 (b). For axisymmetric\nconditions of figure 5.2 (b), the strains are given by equation 5.11 and 5.12 [17].\n\n?v = ?a + 2?r (5.11)\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n46 5.Constitutive Models\n\n?e =\n2\n\n3\n|?a ??r| (5.12)\n\nFor an isotropic elastic material only two material constants are required to define\nthe constitutive response (the relationship between stress and strain). Application of\na pressure results in a volume change, relation 5.13, and the effective stress leads to a\nshape change 5.14 [17].\n\n?v =\np\n\nK\n(5.13)\n\n?e =\n?e\n3G\n\n(5.14)\n\nIn the previous relations, K is the bulk modulus and G the shear modulus. The elastic\nresponse can alternatively be described in terms of the Young\u2019s modulus of equation 5.7\nand Poisson\u2019s ratio, ?. These are related directly to the bulk (relation 5.15) and shear\nmoduli (relation 5.16) [17].\n\nG =\nE\n\n2 (1 + ?)\n(5.15)\n\nK =\nE\n\n3 (1 ? 2?)\n(5.16)\n\nWhen dealing with plastic deformation under multiaxial loading conditions, it is\nnecessary introduce a number of additional concepts. When considering the uniaxial\nbehaviour it was introduced the concept of a yield stress, a stress below which the\nresponse is elastic. Under multiaxial loading, it is possible identify a yield surface, a\nconvex surface in stress space: example is given by figure 5.3. For stress histories within\nthe surface the response is elastic and a compact responds to changes in stress according\nto 5.13 and 5.14. Plastic deformation can only occur if the stress states lies on the yield\nsurface. The yield surface can be expressed as:\n\nf = f(q,p,state) = 0, (5.17)\n\nwhere f is a function of two scalar stress measures, q and p and the current state of\nthe material (which was defined in terms of s, or the accumulated plastic strain under\nuniaxial loading). As with uniaxial loading the response is elastic if f &lt;0 (i.e the stress\nstate lies within yield) and the state f > 0 is not achievable [17].\n\nNow, it is necessary to define how the compact deforms plastically at yield. Since\nplastic strain can accumulate at any point on the yield surface, it proves convenient to\nexpress the response in terms of increments of plastic strain, shown in equations 5.18\nand 5.19 for the axisymmetric loading of figure 5.2 [17].\n\nd?pv = d?\np\na + 2?\n\np\nr (5.18)\n\nd??p =\n2\n\n3\n|d?pa ?d?\n\np\nr | (5.19)\n\nThe effective strain increment, d??p, is always positive, thus effective strain will\nsteadily accumulate:\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n5.Constitutive Models 47\n\n??p =\n\n? ??p\n0\n\nd??p. (5.20)\n\nAn increment of volumetric strain can be related to the change in volume, V of a\nsample:\n\nd?pv = ?\ndV\n\nV\n. (5.21)\n\nIntegrating this relationship from the initial volume V0, when the strain is zero and\nthe volume V , when the volumetric strain is ?\n\np\nv, gives relations 5.22 and 5.23.\n\nV = V0e\n??pv (5.22)\n\n? = ?0e\n?\np\nv (5.23)\n\nIn relation 5.23 ?0 and ? are the initial and current densities of the compact, with\nthe second of these relationships determined from the fact that the mass of the compact\nremains constant [17].\n\nIt is convenient to describe the state of the material in terms of plastic strain at a\ngiven instant, i.e, ?\n\np\nv and ??\n\np, or, since the density is directly related to the volumetric\nstrain, by ? and ??p. Then, the yield condition takes the form shown in 5.24 [17].\n\nf = f (q,p,?, ??pv) = 0 (5.24)\n\nIt is generally assumed that the state can be adequately described in terms of the\ndensity. The yield condition can then be written as relation 5.25 [17].\n\nf = f (q,p,?) = 0 (5.25)\n\nDifferent types of models and forms of yield surface for powder compacts exist. This\nsection, is focused the model used for this research. The Drucker and Prager\u2019s two\npart yield surface was adopted, which was originally developed to model the behaviour\nof soils. In the form currently employed, it consists of an elliptic compaction region\nand a transition region, which simply smooths the response between the compaction\nand shear-Clayfailure regimes, where normality of the strain increment vector is again\nassumed [17].\n\nIn figure 5.3, the shear failure line has been drawn such that a compact has a finite\nshear stress, i.e., there is cohesion [17]. A number of extensions of this model have been\nproposed, however for this research, this plasticity model was adopted and will be fully\nexplained in section 6.4.\n\n5.3.3 Strain Components From Sintering\n\nSintering is mainly affected by viscoelastic behaviour. This is found in those materials\nwhich respond to an applied stress by both recoverable and permanent deformations,\nwhich are time dependent. Non-crystalline organic polymers exhibit this behaviour.\nTime-dependent permanent deformation is termed as viscous flow. When subjected\nto external stresses many crystalline materials undergo not only elastic deformation\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n48 5.Constitutive Models\n\nFigure 5.3: The Drucker-Prager two-surface model [17].\n\nbut also viscous flow. Viscoelastic mechanical behaviour, is the intermediate behaviour\nbetween totally elastic and totally viscous. It may notes that it is analogous to the creep\nphenomenon in crystalline materials [18].\n\nViscoelastic creep happens when the stress level is maintained constant. Many crys-\ntalline materials are found to be susceptible to time-dependent deformation. Such de-\nformation is termed as viscoelastic creep. This type of deformation may be significant\nat room temperature and under modest stresses that lie below the yield strength of the\nmaterial [18].\n\nThus, the behaviour presented in the sintering stage is called thermo-viscoelastic\nbehaviour. The principals influences come from the elastic strain (?e) (this elastic strain\nhas the same behaviour as in section 5.3.2), the creep strain (?cr), and the thermal strain\n(?t). These two last components will be boarded in the next paragraphs.\n\nCreep\n\nCreep is essentially a slow rise of plastic deformation under the action of stress below\nthe yield strength of the material. A typical curve of deformation versus loading time is\nshown in figure 5.4. The first stage is called the unstable or transient creep (also called\ninitial or primary creep). The second stage is the stage of steady-state, or secondary\ncreep and is characterized by a constant deformation rate. At third stage (tertiary, or\naccelerated creep), the deformation rate increases up to failure. The third stage is, as a\nrule, short and should be avoided, since quick failure of parts is inevitable at this stage\n[18].\n\nA physical explanation of the three stages of creep is as follows:\n\n? Primary Creep: This stage is mainly due to dislocation movement. The creep\nrate decreases with time and the effect of work hardening is more than that of the\nrecovery process [18].\n\n? Secondary Creep: The rates of work hardening and recovery during this stage are\nequal, so the material creeps at a steady state rate(minimum creep rate). Depend-\ning upon the state level and temperature, steady state creep may be essentially\nviscous or plastic character [18].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n5.Constitutive Models 49\n\n? Tertiary Creep: Creep rate increases with time until fracture occurs in this stage.\nTertiary creep can occur due to necking of the specimen or grain boundary sliding\nat high temperature and this continues until specimen fractures [18].\n\nFigure 5.4: Creep curve at constant temperature and stress: I - transient creep stage; II\n- steady stage creep; III - fracture stage [18].\n\nThe development of each stage of creep depends on the temperature and stress. The\nphenomenon of creep is observable in metals, ionic and covalent crystals, amorphous\nmaterials such as glasses and polymers. In polymers, the phenomenon of creep is im-\nportant at room temperature, in alloys at 100 ?C, and in steel above 300 ?C. Metals\ngenerally exhibit creep at high temperatures. A material subjected to a constant tensile\nload at an elevated temperature will creep and undergo a time dependent deformation.\nIt is noted that high temperatures lead to rapid creep which is often accompanied by\nmicrostructural changes [18].\n\nMechanisms of Creep\n\nThere are many mechanisms of creep, which have been proposed. Creep is a thermally\nactivated process. Some significant mechanisms that play vital roles during the creep\nprocess are: dislocation climb; vacancy diffusion and grain boundary sliding [18].\n\nAn appreciable atomic movement at high temperature causes the dislocations to\nclimb up and down. In response to the applied stress, the diffusion rate of vacancy may\nproduce a motion by a simple climb of edge dislocation. Obviously, edge dislocations\nare piled up by the obstacles in the glide plane and the rate of creep is governed by the\nrate of escape of dislocations past obstacles [18].\n\nAnother mechanism of creep is called diffusional creep or diffusion of vacancies. The\ndiffusion of vacancies controls the creep rate, but the mechanism does not involve the\nclimb of edge dislocations. In response to the applied stress, the vacancies move from\nsurfaces of the specimen transverse to the stress axis to the surfaces that are parallel to\nthe stress axis. Over a period of time, this movement would elongate the specimen in\nthe direction of the stress axis and contract it in the transverse direction resulting in\ncreep [18].\n\nThe third mechanism of creep is the sliding of grain boundaries, i.e, sliding of neigh-\nbouring grains with respect to the boundary that separate them. When compared to\nindividual grains, grain boundaries lose their strength at a lower temperature. This\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n50 5.Constitutive Models\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 5.5: Mechanism of creep [18].\n\neffect arises from the non-crystalline structure of the grain boundaries and grain bound-\naries play a major role in the creep of polycrystals at high temperatures as they slide\npast each other or create vacancies. At higher temperatures, ductile metals begin to\nlose their ability to strain-harden and become viscous to facilitate the sliding of grain\nboundaries. It is possible to detect that at temperatures above 0.5Tm the viscosity of\nthe grain boundaries is small enough for them to behave like a very viscous liquid sep-\narating the neighbouring grains and allowing them to slide against each other. At low\ntemperatures, grain boundaries do not flow viscously, but provide effective obstacles to\ndislocation motion. Obviously, the grain boundaries facilitate the deformation process\nby sliding at high temperatures, whereas at low temperatures, they increase the yield\nstrength by stopping the dislocations [18].\n\n5.4 Thermal effects\n\nFor porous materials that suffer a relatively small amount of densification during solid\nstate sintering, the thermal deformation should not be ignored. Accurate simulations\nof the entire sintering process require the consideration of not only the creep strain but\nalso the thermal strain.\n\n5.4.1 The sintering cycle\n\nEach material has its own optical sintering cycle. Thus, it is instructive to consider\nknown cycles to establish a starting point for any material. Beyond the parameters of\nparticle size, temperature, and time, there are further influences from the heating rate,\nprocess atmosphere, impurity level, and intermediate holds not regularly noted [7].\n\nThe sintering cycle is the set-up of thermal conditions specifically for densifying pow-\nder metal compacts. Generally, the optimal cycle is material and application dependent.\nA complex sets of factors needs to be considered for the determination of an appropriate\nsintering cycle. Some essential factors are some like heating rate, maximum temperature\nhold time, and atmosphere [7].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n5.Constitutive Models 51\n\nThe sintering cycle selected for this research is shown in figure 5.6. It begins with\nheating at a rate of 10 ?C to a maximum temperature of 1350 ?C. After a one hour hold,\nthe part is cooled at 10 ?C. However, the actual sintering cycle might differ a little bit\nfrom the designed one due to the capability of the furnace. Especially, the cooling rate\nmight not be as expected. If the densification is near complete after the hold, slight\nvariation in the cooling should not have a significant influence on the final shrinkage [1].\nA comparison of the prescribed sintering cycle and an actual one can be seen in figure\n5.6.\n\nFigure 5.6: Sintering cycle [1].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n52 5.Constitutive Models\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\nPart II\n\nNumerical Methodology and\nImplementation\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nNumerical Methods\n\n6.1 Introduction\n\nNowadays, with a constant evolution of competitive economy, the industrial processes\nhave to be adapted to the evolution of modern demands. Therefore, through the years,\nPM industry has adapted to the new tools that engineering offers. With the evolution of\ncomputers and finite element analysis, the PM industry had the necessity of abandoning\nthe trial and error process and starting to resort to FEM. Over time, many researchers\nhave had the ability of adapting an industrial physical process to a finite element model\nand started to study the numerous phenomenons which occur during the process based\nin numerical models. In this research, the compaction and sintering processes are re-\nproduced resorting to ideal models and using the finite element program as an auxiliary\ntool.\n\nIn this chapter, an allusion to the FEM and to the finite element program (Abaqus)\nis done. However, the major objective is to describe the models of the compaction and\nsintering processes.\n\nIn the compaction process, an elasto-plastic model is used that is initial referred\nin section 5.3.2 and is presented in section 6.4. In the sintering process, the model\nadopted for simulating the solid phase of sintering in a finite element program is a\nviscoelasticity model. The viscoelasticity model and the parameters that influence the\nmodel in sintering are exhaustively described in section 6.5.\n\n6.2 Finite Element Method (FEM)\n\nThe finite element method (FEM) is a powerful numeric analysis tool and enables prob-\nlem resolution from various study areas, usually in an approximate form. However, this\nmethod should be an alternatively when there are analytical approaches of solving the\nproblem. Additionally, when this method is used, error estimation should be taken into\nconsideration [14].\n\nEssentially, FEM consists in a subdivision of continuous systems into discrete ele-\nments, in which it is possible to establish constitutive laws. This subdivision process\nis designated discretization and each one of the discretized elements is designated finite\nelement. The several elements that constitute the solid are linked by nodes and in the\ncalculation process there is a necessity to extrapolate the individual model to the global\n\n55\n\n\n\n56 6.Numerical Methods\n\nmodel, which is called assembling. In FEM, many types of elements can be applied\ndepending on the type of problem. In the bidimensional problems, the elements usually\napplied are quadrilateral and triangular. In the tridimensional problems they are usually\nhexahedrons, tetrahedrons and pentahedrons [14].\n\nApproaching the method from the user viewpoint, it is possible to define three dif-\nferent steps. These steps are commonly called: pre-process, analysis and post-process\n[14].\n\nThe pre-process step is connected to the model creation and the discretization of the\nconditions submitted. Commercial software includes many graphic tools that facilitate\nthe task of creating the model. The finite element global analysis quality is strongly\ndependent to the user\u2019s capability to extrapolate the problem for the computation real-\nity, because it is necessary to do some simplifications and to define modelling strategies.\nSometimes, there are complex models to generate and it is common to resort to a spe-\ncialized software to create the models. This is designated CAD program (Computer\nAided Design). So, the necessity of pre-processing appears, for having the ability of\ninterpreting and translating models from other softwares [14].\n\nThe analysis step is the most important part, because it is where all the numeric\ncalculation is done. However, from the user\u2019s point of view, this step is used like a \u201dblack\nbox\u201d. During this stage, many files are generated with all the results that are wanted\nby the user [14].\n\nThe last stage is about interpreting the files referred in the previous paragraph and\nshow them in a user friendly form. Typically, the results are presented under color maps,\nwhich present a friendly way to interpret the results [14].\n\n6.3 Abaqus\n\nThe finite element code adopted for this research is the Abaqus program because it has\nnumerous applications and good calculation power, specifically in thermo-mechanical\nmodels. The Abaqus/CAE program uses a graphic interface, where the pre-processing\nis made, and it allows to implement all the simulation architecture, starting with the\ngeometry, passing through temporary integration, as well as problem discretization. In\nthis stage, the code allows the definition of several necessary aspects and at the end it\ngenerates an ASCII text file with INP extension, which the calculation engine processes\n[14].\n\nThe analysis step is done by Abaqus/Standard or by Abaqus/Explicit, depending\non the temporal integration choice that was made in the pre-processing step. However,\nin the context of this work, it is used the Abaqus/Standard, due to implicit integration\nthat shows more stability in the calculation process. Independently of time integration\nchosen, the calculation engine generates several output files during the simulation, like\nresult files, error messages or warnings and the several time increments\u2019 description\nconsidered by the calculation engine [14].\n\nFinally, the post-processing is realized through the Abaqus/Viewer that operates the\nresults file and allows the user to visualize the obtained results [14].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n6.Numerical Methods 57\n\n6.4 The Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap Model\n\nIn the first stage of the present work, for understanding the compaction phase, it was\nmodelled and simulated using the FEM with Abaqus. Process simulations resorting to\nFEM program may be useful for controlling the shape of final PM components and can\nprovide the distribution of green density and stresses of the compacted parts [19] [20].\n\nIn order to have a reliable numerical simulation it is necessary to perform two tasks.\nThe first task is to chose an appropriate constitutive model for modelling the compaction\nprocess in a FEM program. Secondly, well defined calibration experiments are carried\nout for an easy identification of the constitutive model parameters of the powder material\n[20]. This second task was not reproduced in the present work. The constitutive model\nparameters used for implementing the model in the FEM program were taken from the\nliterature.\n\nIn the past decades, many constitutive models including micro-mechanical and macro-\nmechanical models have been studied. The compaction of metals and ceramic powders\ncan be simulated using phenomenological elasto-plastic continuum models from soils\nmechanics. These models are typically implemented in finite element codes and have\nbeen used to investigate the macroscopic property distributions in powders during com-\npaction. Specifically, in this work, it was chosen the phenomenological modified Drucker-\nPrager/Cap (DPC) constitutive model which was originally intended to model geological\nmaterials, it has been modified and adapted for metal powder compaction. The mod-\nified Drucker-Prager/Cap model defines the behaviour of powder rearrangement and\nconsolidation during compaction processes very well [20].\n\n6.4.1 Description of the constitutive model\n\nIn the analysis to be made in part III, the modified Drucker-Prager/Cap elasto-plasticity\nmodel is adopted to model the uniaxial compaction of metal powders. This model is\nimplemented in the library of the commercially available finite element program Abaqus.\nThis type of model allows the effect of the stress states to be addressed during the un-\nloading (removal of the upper punch) and after the ejection (removal of the compacted\ncomponent from the die) as well as during the compression model itself [21]. In elasto-\nplastic materials with work hardening, it is necessary to consider a constitutive model\nthat consists primarily in three parameters: the yielding criterion, the flow potential and\nthe hardening criteria that govern the evolution of the cap as a function of volumetric\nstrain [22]. The modified Drucker-Prager/Cap elasto-plasticity model allows the compu-\ntation of the density distribution and the prediction of the redistribution of the density\nafter the load removal and during the ejection modes [21]. A typical yield surface that\ncharacterizes this model is represented in figure 6.1. This surface is plotted in a stress\nspace characterized by:\n\np =\n1\n\n3\n(?1 + ?2 + ?3) , (6.1)\n\nJ?2 = q =\n1\n\n6\n\n[\n(?1 ??2)2 + (?2 ??3)2 + (?3 ??1)2\n\n]\n. (6.2)\n\nThe equations shown in 6.1 and 6.2 represent the coordinates where the equivalent\npressure or hydrostatic pressure is p and the von Mises equivalent or effective stress (also\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n58 6.Numerical Methods\n\nFigure 6.1: Drucker-Prager/Cap model; yield surfaces in the p?q plane [22].\n\ncalled the second invariant of the deviatoric stress) is\n?\nJ?2. Also, in equation 6.1 and\n\n6.2 ?1, ?2 and ?3 are the principal stresses (compression assumed positive) [21].\nIn the modified Drucker-Prager/Cap model, the yield surface includes two main\n\nsegments: a shear failure surface, providing predominately shear failure (Fs) and a cap\nwhich intersects the hydrostatic stress axis (Fc) (figure 6.1). There is also a transition\nregion between these segments (Ft), which is introduced to provide a smooth surface.\nThe cap line serves two main purposes. It bounds the yield surface in pure hydrostatic\ncompression, thus providing an inelastic hardening mechanism to represent the plastic\nnature of the compaction. It also controls the volume dilatancy when the material yields\nin shear, by providing a softening as a function of the inelastic volume increases created\nas the material yields on the shear failure and the transition yield surfaces [21].\n\nNow, the essential components of the current model are demonstrated. A linear\nstrain rate decomposition is assumed in the form:\n\nd? = d?el + d?pl (6.3)\n\nwhere d? is the total strain rate, d?el is the elastic strain rate, and d?pl is the inelastic\n(plastic) strain rate. The elastic behaviour may be modelled as linear elastic, or by\nusing various types of non-linear elastic models [21]. In the current numerical analysis\nthe elastic response is assumed to be linear.\n\nThe yield function for admissible stresses, in the modified Drucker-Prager/cap model,\nis established by three surfaces in the p-q plane. The shear surface Fs rules the initial\ncompaction and densification during powder compaction [22]. This criterion describes\nthe shear stress required for simple slip, depending on the cohesion and hydrostatic\npressure. This shear surface is defined by:\n\nFs(q,p) = q ?d?p.tan(?) = 0, (6.4)\n\nwhere d is the material\u2019s cohesion and ? is the material\u2019s internal friction angle. The\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n6.Numerical Methods 59\n\nparameters ? and d are often given some physical significance [21] but in this research\nare simply regarded as unique material properties.\n\nThe cap surface, Fc is responsible for controlling the densification/hardening of the\nmaterial at large compaction pressures. The cap surface hardens or softens as a function\nof the volumetric strain: volumetric plastic compaction (when yielding on the cap) causes\nhardening (in a triaxial stress), while volumetric plastic dilation (when yielding on the\nshear failure surface) causes shear induced softening. The cap surface is represented in\nfigure 6.1 and is modelled as an ellipse with a constant eccentricity in p? q space [21]\n[22]. The cap surface, Fc is given by:\n\nFc(q,p) =\n\n(\n(p?pa)2 +\n\n[\nR\u00d7q\n\n1 + ? + ?/cos?\n\n]2)1/2\n?R (d + pa.tan?) = 0, (6.5)\n\nwhere the constant R is the material parameter that controls the shape of the cap (equal\nto the ratio of the major and minor axes of the elliptical cap), pa is an evolution parame-\nter that represents the volumetric plastic strain driven hardening/softening effects and ?\nis a constant that ensures a smooth transition between the shear and cap surfaces. It is\nassumed that the cap surface is a continuous family of ellipses and each one corresponds\nto a value of inelastic strain rate, i.e, the relative density of the compact. A harden-\ning/softening law must be defined which relates the hydrostatic compaction yield stress,\n\npb, and the corresponding volumetric plastic strain ?\npl\nvol (figure 6.2) [21]. The evolution\n\nparameter pa is defined in the form:\n\npa =\npb ?Rd\n\n(1 + Rtan?)\n, (6.6)\n\nwhere the parameter ? is a small number (typically 0.001 to 0.05) used to provide a\nsmooth transition surface between the shear failure surface and the cap [21].\n\nFigure 6.2: Typical cap hardening [21].\n\nWith the objective to obtain a smooth yield surface, a transition region is defined\nbetween the shear failure line and the cap surface using ?.\n\nFt(q,p) = {(p?pa)2 +[q ? (1 ??/cos?) (d + pa.tan?)]2}1/2?? (d + pa.tan?) = 0 (6.7)\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n60 6.Numerical Methods\n\nThis smooth transition between the cap and failure yield surfaces is necessary for pre-\nventing the corners between these two yield surfaces and also avoid numerical instabilities\nwhile transitioning the shear and the cap yield surfaces [22].\n\nPlastic flow is defined by a flow potential that is associated in the deviatoric plane,\nassociated on the cap in the meridional plane and non-associated on the failure surface\nand the transition surface in the meridional plane [21]. The flow potential, which is\nsimilar to the yield locus, must be described in a powder compaction model, being\nnecessary to study the evolution of inelastic deformation that results from densification\nand plastic deformation of particles. The direction of the plastic strain is controlled by\nthe shape of plastic flow potential [22]. The flow potential surface in the meridional\nplane is shown in figure 6.3.\n\nFigure 6.3: Flow potential in p?q plane [20].\n\nThe flow potential is made up of an elliptical portion in the cap region (equation\n6.8) that is identical to the cap yield surface (equation 6.5). Another elliptical portion\nin the failure and transition regions that provides the non-associated flow component in\nthe model is given by:\n\nGc = Fc(q,p) =\n\n(\n(p?pa)2 +\n\n[\nR\u00d7q\n\n1 + ? + ?/cos?\n\n]2)1/2\n?R (d + patan?) = 0, (6.8)\n\nGs = {[(p?pa) tan?]2 + q2}1/2. (6.9)\n\nThe two elliptical portions Gc and Gs form a continuous and smooth potential surface\n[21].\n\n6.5 Linear Viscoelasticity Theory\n\nAs can be deduced from its name, viscoelastic materials possess both viscous and elas-\ntic properties in varying degrees. Linear viscoelasticity is the simplest response of a\nviscoelastic material [15].\n\nThe linear theory of viscoelasticity was primarily applied on polymeric materials to\nstudy their behaviour [1]. In general, research on viscoelastic behaviour of polymeric\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n6.Numerical Methods 61\n\nmaterials and their composites are well advanced when compared to powder metallurgy\ncomponents, even though their application is extensive [23]. Materials within the scope\nof viscoelasticity theory possess a capacity to store and dissipate mechanical energy. For\nthese materials, a state of stress induces an instantaneous deformation followed by a\nflow process which may or may not be limited in magnitude as time grows. The external\nloads could influenced not only by mechanical forces or stresses, but also by thermal\ninduced loadings, such as the hydrostatic sintering stress [1].\n\nSince a viscoelastic material exhibits both an instantaneous elasticity effect and creep\ncharacteristics, the material response is not determined only by the current state of stress,\nbut also by all past states of stress. The incremental theory of plasticity also accounts for\nthe history dependent material behaviour. However, the underlying difference between\nthe theories of plasticity and viscoelasticity is that the first is independent of the time\nscale involved in loading and unloading while the second has a specific time or rate\ndependence [1].\n\nAt high temperatures associated with sintering, the porous material presents elastic\nand viscous types of behaviour. During pressure or pressureless whether there is a\nconstant or zero mechanical loading, a time-dependent strain will emerge during the\nlong process. This thermal induced strain is called the sintering strain, viscous strain,\nor creep strain. This creep strain is similar to the traditionally defined creep strain\nwhich results from constant mechanical loading and is both permanent time dependent.\nTherefore, the viscoelasticity theory can be used to simulate the sintering process [1].\n\n6.5.1 Viscoelasticity Models\n\nAs was said before, viscoelasticity indicates a material with the features of both a viscous\nfluid and an elastic solid. The term elastic and viscous nature is the represented action\nof spring and the response of a putty system. In the first case, the return of spring to\nits original position when stretched and then released is an example of elastic action. In\nthe second case, the retaining capability of the extended state when it is pulled is an\nexample of viscous nature. Materials with a combination of these properties are called\nviscoelastic [23].\n\nMany viscoelasticity models have been developed to describe a wide range of defor-\nmation behaviours. These models are composed by elastic and viscous components in\nvarious configurations. Usually, the elastic component can be represented by an elastic\nspring and the viscous component by a dashpot, a pot that contains a viscous liquid that\ncan flow under the action of a piston. A representative illustration of the deformation\nbehaviour of the components is shown in figure 6.4. The equations which describe the\nresponses of figure 6.4 are given by:\n\n? = E? and (6.10)\n\n? = ?\n\n(\nd?\n\ndt\n\n)\n, (6.11)\n\nwhere ? is the tensile stress, E is Young\u2019s modulus and ? is the viscosity [1].\n\nDifferent forms of the yield components lead to different models. A very well known\nis the Maxwell model. This model consists of a spring and a dashpot placed in series.\nThe overall strain rate is the sum of the contributions from both components, and the\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n62 6.Numerical Methods\n\nFigure 6.4: Spring and dashpot components and their mechanical response [1].\n\nconstitutive equation is given by:\n\n?? =\n??\n\nE\n+\n?\n\n?\n, (6.12)\n\nwhere the first part of the right hand side corresponds to the equivalent elastic strain\nrate, while the second part is the creep strain rate. It is relevant to note that the\nequivalent elastic strain rate is a function of the stress state, which can change with time\nduring sintering [1].\n\n(a) The Maxwell\nmodel of a spring and\ndashpot in series\n\n(b) The Kelvin model\nof a spring and a\ndashpot in parallel\n\nFigure 6.5: The Maxwell and Kelvin models [24].\n\nAn alternative to the Maxwell model (figure 6.5 (a)) is the Voigt or the Kelvin model\n(figure 6.5 (b)) that is characterized by a spring and a dashpot in parallel. In this model,\nthe strains on the two components are always the same and the overall stress is the sum\nof the stresses on the spring and dashpot [1]. The corresponding constitutive equation\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n6.Numerical Methods 63\n\nis given by:\n\n? = E? + ???. (6.13)\n\n6.5.2 Constitutive Equations\n\nFor this research, a set of constitutive equations based on the Maxwell model were\nadopted, which is more suitable for describing the deformation behaviour of metals at\nhigh temperature.\n\nFor the phenomenological model of sintering, the constitutive equation is selected as\na nonlinear viscous incompressible model containing uniformly distributed voids. The\nstrain rate is subdivided in a component of equivalent elastic strain rate ??e, thermal\nstrain rate ??t, and creep strain rate ??cr and is given by:\n\n?? = ??e + ??t + ??cr. (6.14)\n\nIn the right hand part of equation 6.14, the elastic strain portion is assumed to be linear\nand isotropic. Thus, it can be represented by:\n\n??e =\n??\n\nC\n. (6.15)\n\nEquation 6.15 can be expressed by the rate form of Hooke\u2019s law, as is shown in equation\n6.16 [1].\n\n?? = C??e = C\n(\n??? ??t ? ??cr\n\n)\n(6.16)\n\nThe stress can be calculated from the integral of equation 6.16 [1].\n\n? =\n\n?\n??dt =\n\n?\nC??edt =\n\n?\nC\n(\n??? ??t ? ??cr\n\n)\ndt (6.17)\n\nThermal strain is proportional to the change in temperature of the material and is\nthe same in all directions for an isotropic material. It can be calculated as:\n\n?t = ? \u00b7 ?T, (6.18)\n\nwhere, the parameter ? represents the thermal expansion coefficient, which is usually a\nfunction of temperature, ?T is the difference between the current and reference temper-\natures [1].\n\nThe creep strain rate, applied in this work, consists in two parts: the ratio between\nthe deviatoric stress ?? and shear viscosity modulus, ?s , and the ratio between the\nequivalent volumetric stress and bulk viscosity modulus ?b. In order to analyse the\ndimensional change of the sintering body, the creep strain rate is given by:\n\n??cr =\n??\n\n2?s\n+\ntr (?) ? 3?s\n\n9?b\nI, (6.19)\n\nwhere ?s is the sintering stress (sintering driving force), tr(?) is the trace of the stress\ntensor and I an identity matrix. In the right side of equation 6.19, the first term\nrepresents the shape distortion of the sintering body, and the second one determines the\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n64 6.Numerical Methods\n\nFigure 6.6: A diagram to show the local stress state of the sintering body that undergoes\nshape and volume changes [9].\n\nvolume change or density evolution. In the sintering model, the local stress equilibrium\nis presented under zero external loading [1]. The local stress can be shown in figure 6.6.\n\nThe ?s, ?b and ?s are the material parameters. Generally, they are influenced by\nfactors such as relative density, temperature, grain size and pore size, as well as the\nphysical parameters of the material such as the diffusion coefficient and activation energy\n[9].\n\n6.5.3 Viscosity Modulus\n\nViscosity is the material resistance to viscous flow. Usually, the viscosity modulus is\ntemperature-dependent. During sintering, temperature has a wide variation, therefore,\nthe material response is expected to vary. For this study, it is reasonable to consider\nthe viscous flow of a thermal activated process, therefore it is employed the Arrhenius\nequation given by:\n\n? = ?0e\nQv\nRT , (6.20)\n\nwhere Qv is the activation energy for viscous flow, ?0 is a pre-exponential material\nconstant, R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature. When\nthe material starts to behave more like a liquid, at high sintering temperatures, the\nArrhenius relation is expected to be more accurate [1].\n\nFor a porous material, because of the existence of pore area, the parameters in the\ncontinuous viscoelasticity theory should be modified before they can be employed. Most\nof these parameters are functions of porosity. The shear viscosity modulus ?s and bulk\nviscosity modulus ?b are defined as:\n\n?s = (1 ??)2 ? and (6.21)\n\n?b =\n4\n\n3\n\n(1 ??)3\n\n?\n?, (6.22)\n\nwhere ? is the porosity defined as the ratio of void and bulk volumes, and ? is the\napparent viscosity defined in equation 6.20 [1].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n6.Numerical Methods 65\n\n6.5.4 Sintering Stress\n\nSintering stress has an important impact on the sintering kinetics. Sintering stress,\n?s, also named sintering driving force, is the equivalent hydrostatic pressure caused\nby local capillary stresses in porous structures. The resulting stress gradient provides\na driving force for mass flow to the neck formed between contacting particles so that\nthe pore area fills with material and the density increases [1]. Sintering stress arises\nfrom interfacial energies acting over curved surfaces and in many equations proposed\nby several researches, for predicting the sintering stress, it is in function of porosity,\nsurface energy, particle shape and particle size [1] [9]. The expression of sintering stress\nproposed by Olevsky is given by:\n\n?s =\nC?2\n\nr0\n. (6.23)\n\nThe sintering stress is widely used for numerical simulation of stainless steel sintering,\nwhere r0 is the average radius of the powder particles, C is a material constant dependent\nof the surface energy of material. Equation 6.23 is proposed for the initial sintering stage\nbut it is also used for the intermediate and final stages in many researches [9]. Another\nway to present equation 6.23 is given by:\n\n?s =\n3?s\nr?\n\n(1 ??)2 , (6.24)\n\nwhere, ? is the porosity, which is defined as the ratio of the volume of pores to the total\nvolume, and r? denotes the average void size or average particle radius [1].\n\nFor many crystalline materials, the dominant mass transport mechanism is through\ngrain boundary diffusion, which is developed in the intermediate stage of solid-state sin-\ntering. In this research, the sintering behaviour of the selected material is dominated by\ngrain diffusion, so the sintering stress relationship considered to be the most appropriate\nis one that incorporates surface tension, relative density and average grain size. For this\nresearch, sintering stress is defined as:\n\n?s =\n6?s\nG\n\n(1 ??)2 , (6.25)\n\nwhere G is the average grain size representing the influence of grain boundary diffusion\n[1].\n\n6.5.5 Grain Growth Models\n\nGrain growth plays an important role in sintering because excessive grain size will not\nonly obstruct the densification, but it also influences the final mechanical properties of\nthe sintered components [9]. With the objective to apply the grain growth in FEM\nsimulation of the sintering process, it was necessary to find an empirical equation that\ncan accurately describe the grain size change during sintering.\n\nVarious empirical models of grain growth have been developed for different materials\nand based on different mechanisms. For normal grain growth, a parabolic law and a\npower law have been used in many studies. The ideal grain growth law relates the mean\ngrain size to initial grain size and time. The relation is called the parabolic law model\nand is given by:\n\nG2 ?G20 = K1t, (6.26)\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n66 6.Numerical Methods\n\nwhile the power law is governed by:\n\nG = K2t\nn, (6.27)\n\nwhere the parameter G means the mean grain size at time t, G0 is the initial mean\ngrain size, K1 and K2 are material constants, and n is the grain growth exponent. The\nparabolic law and power law predict the grain growth in ceramics, such as alumina [1].\n\nHere, the concern is to understand grain growth behaviour for metal alloys such as\naustenitic stainless steels. It is assumed that atomic diffusion in grain growth is a simple\nthermally activated process, therefore an Arrhenius-type grain growth equation fits well\nin this study. Based on different experiments, various forms of Arrhenius-type grain\ngrowth equations have been developed. For this specific case of grain growth in solid\nstate sintering, a short description is presented (in table 6.1) for different Arrhenius-type\nequations in different stainless steels [1].\n\nTable 6.1: Grain growth equation for continuous material stainless steel [1].\nNumber Equation Material QG (kJ/mol)\n\n1 Gn ?Gn0 = Atexp(?QG/RT) Austenitic Stainless Steel 310\n2 G?G0 = Atnexp(?QG/RT) NdFeB 215\n\n3 dG\ndt\n\n=\nAexp(?QG/RT)\n\nG\n\nSteel 208\nSS316L &amp; SS316LB 316/50\n\nSS316 280\nSS316L 246\n\nIn table 6.1, the parameter n is an assumed integer that, in case of austenitic stainless\nsteel, ranges from 3 to 5, A is a material constant, QG is the activation energy for grain\ngrowth, R is the universal gas constant and T is the absolute temperature [1]. The grain\ngrowth Arrhenius equation chosen for this study was the number 3, given by:\n\ndG\n\ndt\n=\nAe?\n\nQG\nRT\n\nG\n. (6.28)\n\nThis type of Arrhenius equation was chosen because of its good match in grain growth\nphenomena in stainless steel 316L.\n\nFor this differential equation it was necessary to search for experimental parame-\nters. The parameter A is a pre-exponent constant, QG is the activation energy for grain\ngrowth, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature and G is the\ninstantaneous grain size. The pre-exponent constant is determined experimentally. In\nthis research, the only interest is to understand the grain growth behaviour in computa-\ntional simulation. Thus, it is assumed a pre-exponent factor A from the literature. Now\nfocusing on activation energy for grain growth, it is known for stainless steel the activa-\ntion energy shifts from an upper level to a lower level after a transition temperature is\nreached [25]. The parameters values are presented in subsection 7.3.3.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nImplementation\n\n7.1 Introduction\n\nAs has been mentioned, this research is divided in two major areas: the compaction\nstage and the sintering stage.\n\nFor compacting the loose powder in a certain shape to form a porous body it is\nnecessary to select a suitable model. Therefore, the modified Drucker-Prager/Cap elasto-\nplastic model for implementing the compaction stage was selected. It is the most adopted\nmodel for reproducing compression of a loose powder in a finite element program. This\nmodel works largely in the inelastic zone, so the elastic behaviour in the compaction stage\nis minimal, being predominantly characterized by the plastic behaviour. In addition\nto the Drucker-Prager implementation, the objective is also to estimate the density\ngradients. Therefore, the UVARM subroutine in conjunction with the modified Drucker-\nPrager/Cap elasto-plastic model is implemented, in the finite element program.\n\nThe sintering stage, which is a long process due to its slow evolution, which may\nlast hours, follows. However, it is time-dependent and it is considered as a quasi-static\nproblem. For implementing the sintering process considering the solid-state of sintering,\nmany mechanisms important in sintering are taken into account. All the sintering mecha-\nnisms are implemented resorting to a user\u2019s subroutine, which is the CREEP subroutine.\nThe implementation of this subroutine is based on the concepts presented in section 7.3.\nThe compaction and sintering processes and auxiliary tools that were implemented in\nthis research are explained in the following sections.\n\n7.2 Modified Drucker-Prager/Cap Model in ABAQUS\n\nThe Drucker-Prager/Cap model is provided within the library of the commercial finite\nelement program Abaqus. Therefore, in order to use the soil plasticity model, in the\ncompaction stage, it is only needed material parameters. In chapter 6.4 the three surfaces\nthat define the model were characterized: a pressure-dependent Drucker-Prager shear\nfailure surface (Fs), a series of compression yield surfaces (Fc), and a transition surface\n(Ft). Volumetric strain hardening is defined by moving the cap along the hydrostatic\naxis. The purpose of the transition surface is to remove any singularities during numerical\ncomputations when moving from the yield surface to the failure surface. Figure 6.1 shows\nthe surfaces defined by the modified Drucker-Prager/Cap model in ABAQUS. The three\n\n67\n\n\n\n68 7.Implementation\n\nsurfaces are described by the equations 6.4, 6.5 and 6.7 [4]. In this three equations, it is\nnecessary to define the material parameters, given by:\n\n? ? is the angle of internal friction;\n\n? d is the material cohesion;\n\n? t is the deviatoric stress measure;\n\n? p is the equivalent pressure stress;\n\n? R is the cap eccentricity parameter;\n\n? pa\n\n(\n?\n\npl\nvol\n\n)\nrepresents the volumetric plastic-strain-driven hardening\n\n? ? is the transition parameter\n\nThe hardening law is defined by a piecewise linear function relating the hydrostatic\ncompression yield stress, pb, to the volumetric plastic strain ?\n\npl\nvol as shown in figure\n\n6.2. ?\npl\nvol|0 is the initial volumetric plastic strain beyond which the work hardening yield\n\nsurfaces are defined. The evolution parameter, pa is related to pb by equation 6.6 [4].\n\n7.2.1 UVARM Subroutine\n\nThe subroutine UVARM is used in the compaction phase. This subroutine is defined\nat the material part and is applied when there is a necessity of defining a user output\nvariable. The UVARM subroutine is called at all integration points, being called multiple\ntimes for each material point in an increment, as Abaqus iterates to a converged solution\n[26].\n\nIn this study, the UVARM subroutine was used because there was a necessity to define\noutput quantities that are function of any of the available integration point quantities\nlisted in the output variables. Therefore, with the purpose of studying the density\ngradients the UVARM subroutine was employed.\n\nIn order to extract the values of density at every integration point it was applied a\nsimple model that combines strains with densities. In compaction, the external physical\nchange is a decrease in volume, so the equation that translates this assumption is given\nby:\n\n?z + ?r + ?? =\nV0 ?V1\nV0\n\n. (7.1)\n\nEquation 7.1 represents the fractional change in the initial volume, where ?z, ?r and\n?? are the strains in the axial, radial and tangential directions, respectively and V0 and\nV1 are volumes of the green compact before and after the compaction respectively [21].\nThe expression presented in 7.1 can be manipulated and written as:\n\n?z + ?r + ?? = ?total =\n?0 ??1\n?1\n\n(7.2)\n\nEquation 7.2 is the fractional change in the final mean density, where ?0 and ?1 are\nthe initial and final densities of the green body. Thus, the local density distribution may\nbe calculated from the total strain value, ?total being defined as [21]:\n\n?1 =\n?0\n\n1 + ?total\n(7.3)\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n7.Implementation 69\n\nThe UVARM subroutine uses equation 7.3. This subroutine is an Abaqus/Standard\nutility that allows the determination and visualization of the density gradients. These\ngradients are essential to finish the compaction phase and start the sintering phase.\n\n7.3 Sintering Stage\n\nIn this section, all the parameters necessary to implement the sintering simulation are\ndefined. The major parameters that influence the sintering behaviour are defined: i) the\nelasticity and viscosity; ii) the sintering stress and transition temperature parameters;\niii) the grain growth and iv) the porosity and thermal strain. All these parameters are\nimplemented in the CREEP subroutine that is established in the sintering simulation\nand which is described in section 7.3.6.\n\n7.3.1 Elasticity and Viscosity\n\nThe elastic modulus can vary directly with temperature. In other words, with the in-\ncreasing of temperature the elastic modulus decreases. Additionally, the elastic modulus\nof a porous material is smaller than that of the bulk solid material. Many attempts have\nbeen made to relate parameters like elasticity modulus with the porosity because in the\nsintering stage some parameters are directly related with average porosity. However,\nsome researches demonstrated with numerical experiments that the final result of the\nsintering simulation is not sensitive to small changes in elastic modulus. The constant\nYoung\u2019s modulus is determined by:\n\nE = E0?\nY , (7.4)\n\nwhere E0 is the full density elastic modulus which will decrease as temperature increases\nand is approximately 140 GPa at 500 ?C and the exponent Y equals 3.4 for sintered\nsteel. For this research, ?, the bulk density is equals to 62%. Furthermore, the constant\nYoung\u2019s modulus equals 69.3 GPa. Additionally, a constant Poisson\u2019s ratio, 0.28, is used\n[1].\n\nThe apparent viscosity in a thermally activated viscous flow was modelled by the Ar-\nrehnius temperature, equation 6.20. Some material parameters constants are employed\nin the Arrhenius temperature relation, which are the pre-exponential factor, ?0, that\nusually takes the value of 790 MPa.s and the activation energy, Qv, that is equal to 20.0\nkJ/mol [1].\n\n7.3.2 Porosity/Relative Density\n\nIn every time increment, the porosity/relative density is updated using the strain com-\nponent. In the sintering stage, geometric nonliearity should be accounted for, due to\nlarge deformation during the evolution of the sintering cycle. The relative density can\nbe described in terms of logarithmic strain components as:\n\n? = ?0e\n(??kk), (7.5)\n\nwhere ?0 is the initial relative density, ? is the final relative density, and ?kk is the\nvolumetric strain. When this relation is implemented in CREEP subroutine, ?kk is\napproximated by the swelling strain ??sw, which is updated at the beginning of each\nincrement [1].\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n70 7.Implementation\n\n7.3.3 The Grain Growth Model\n\nThe grain size is updated using the Arrhenius type equation grain growth that is shown\nin equation 6.28. For this empirical differential equation, some material constant param-\neters must be defined. The pre-exponent constant, A, is determined experimentally. In\nthis research, the only interest is understanding the grain growth behaviour in compu-\ntational simulation. Therefore, a pre-exponent for stainless steel powder was adopted,\nin this case equal to 6, 75 \u00d7 10?13 m2/s. The activation energy for grain growth, QG,\nis 316 kJ/mol for temperatures less than approximately 1200 ?C and 50.0 kJ/mol when\ntemperatures are greater than approximately 1200 ?C.\n\n7.3.4 Sintering Stress\n\nThe sintering stress used in the sintering stage is described by equation 6.25. This\nsintering stress, ?s, is related directly with surface tension energy, average grain size and\nrelative density. The relative density is updated using the volumetric strain components\n(relation 7.5). The surface tension energy, ?s, is a constant parameter and in the sintering\nstage a value of 2.0 J/m2 is applied.\n\n7.3.5 Thermal Strain\n\nThe thermal strain, ??t, is caused by expansion/contraction and it can be expressed by:\n\n??t = ??T, (7.6)\n\nwhere ? is the thermal expansion coefficient and ?T is temperature increment. Based on\nthe assumption of the transition temperature for sintering stress, the thermal expansion\ndominates at low temperatures, i.e, temperatures below the transition temperature. The\ntemperature dependent behaviour of the thermal expansion coefficient can be determined\nby experiments carried out in the dilatometer. For this research, experimental data is\nadopted from the literature. In the literature, the conclusion was that the thermal\nexpansion coefficient of a porous material is in general slightly smaller than that of the\nfully dense material. For this research, the major concern is in the deformation due to\nsintering, considering that the thermal deformation is not the main concern taking into\naccount the deformations acting in the sintering stage. So, a linear empirical equation\nis applied to describe the thermal expansion coefficient as a function of temperature by:\n\n? = c1T + c2, (7.7)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are measured material constant taken from experiments. For this\nresearch, and for a material like stainless steel, C1 assumes the value 4.47 \u00d7 10?9K?2\nand C2 is 12.1 \u00d7 10?6K?1 [1].\n\n7.3.6 CREEP subroutine\n\nIn order to employ the model presented in section 6.5, the Abaqus subroutine CREEP\nis used. User subroutine CREEP will be called at all integration points of elements\nfor which the material definition contains user-subroutine-defined metal creep and time-\ndependent volumetric swelling, during procedures that allow viscoelastic response of the\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n7.Implementation 71\n\ntypes referenced to occur (such as the quasi-static procedure). The user subroutine is\napplied to define a material behaviour that can be used in the coupled-temperature\ndisplacement.\n\nFor metals, the incremental creep strain routine allows swelling and creep as defined\nin 7.8 [1].\n\n??cr =\n1\n\n3\n???swR + ???crn (7.8)\n\nEquation 7.8 is defined as ???sw being the incremental volumetric swelling strain and\n???cr the uniaxial equivalent creep strain. The incremental volumetric swelling strain\nand the uniaxial equivalent creep strain are defined by the user in the subroutine based\non the creep model. For isotropic swelling R becomes the unit matrix I. The gradient\nof the deviatoric stress potential n is defined in relation 7.9 [1].\n\nn =\n?q?\n\n??\n=\n\n3??\n\n2q?\n(7.9)\n\nIn relation 7.9 the deviatoric stress is given by:\n\n?? = ? + pI, (7.10)\n\nwhere p = ?1\n3\ntr(?) is the equivalent pressure stress. The equivalent deviatoric stress is\n\ngiven by:\n\nq? =\n\n?\n3\n\n2\n????. (7.11)\n\nIn this thesis, the creep rate equation (6.19) is shown as the incremental form of the\ncreep strain rate:\n\n??cr =\ntr(?)?t? 3?s?t\n\n9?b\nI +\n\n???t\n\n2?s\n.

The sintering stress is called at all integration\npoints of the element at each time increment [1].\n\n7.3.7 Creep Subroutine Architecture\n\nThe creep subroutine was implemented into the sintering stage. In the creep subroutine\nwas essentially written the viscoelastic model described in 6.5.1. The viscoelasticity\nmodel was built under a conventional model presented in the next topics. Thus, the\nimplementation of the viscoelasticity model in the subroutine followed a specific order:\n\nFirst Load the material constants, which are: initial grain size (G0); pre-exponent factor\n(A); activation energy for viscous flow (Qv); a pre-exponential material constant\n(?0) and the universal gas constant (R);\n\nSecond The grain growth behaviour. The Arrhenius equation that controls the grain\nsize is applied (equation 6.28) and the activation energy (QG) in function of the\ntransition temperature is written;\n\nThird The surface tension energy (?s). Surface energy is activated when temperature\nis above of the transition temperature;\n\nFourth In this point, the principal mechanism written in the creep subroutineis ex-\nplained. The objective is to determine the porosity, and consequently the density.\nIn the sintering simulation the density is updated at every increment using the\nrelation refereed in 7.5. In the creep subroutine, the parameter ?kk is assumed to\nbe equal to the swelling strain ??sw and it is known that the swelling strain that is\nupdated at the beginning of each increment is given by equation 7.15. The swelling\nstrain is directly dependent on the viscosity modulus (6.22) and on the sintering\nstress (6.25). On the other hand, the viscosity modulus and the sintering stress are\ndirectly dependent on the viscous flow (equation 6.20), and on the average grain\nsize (equation 6.20), that are also dependent of porosity (?) and surface tension\nenergy (?s). With this description it is noticed that all equations are dependent\non one of the others for certain parameters, and one of them is the porosity that\nare intimately connected with density. Therefore, it was necessary to resort to an\niteration method to estimate the value of porosity, and with that, calculate all the\nmaterial equations refereed before. Thus, the bissection method was applied for\nestimating the value of porosity. With the porosity estimated, the viscous flow (?)\nwas easily calculated followed by the viscosity modulus (?b). Next, the sintering\nstress (?s) is calculated based on the estimative of porosity (?) and the second and\nthe third topics, already described, were also calculated. With these values, the\nswelling strain(??sw) necessary for determining the density is calculated. When the\nvalue of density (?) is determined, the porosity (?) value is calculated and that\nvalue is used for calculating another iteration using the bissection method;\n\nFifth Update the value of the volumetric swelling strain ???sw (equation 7.15) and\ncalculate the value of the uniaxial equivalent creep strain ???cr (equation 7.16);\n\nSixth Define the values of relevant parameters in solution-dependent variables (SDV).\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n7.Implementation 73\n\n ?,\n\n?? = 0 ? ?? = 1\n\n?\n\n ???\n\n?\n\n?? =\n?? + ??\n\n2\n\n??\n\n??\n\n??+1 = 1 ? ?\n\n??+1 + ??\n??\n\n&lt;0.01\n\n?? = ??\n\n?? = ??\n\nFigure 7.1: Schematic for the iteration process.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n74 7.Implementation\n\n7.3.8 Bissection Method\n\nAs was refereed before, the implementation of the viscoelastic model follows a specific\norder in the calculation process. It should be noticed that the shear modulus, the vis-\ncosity and the sintering stress are dependent of porosity. However, the porosity variable\nis determined in the last part of calculations in the creep subroutine. Consequently,\nan iterative process is required and an initial estimative has to be made. In order to\nimplement a robust and methodical iterative process the bissection method is used. This\nmethod consists in building subintervals, Ik = [ak,bk] ? I, through successive divisions\nin the middle of the interval. Thus, the value that is to be estimated is confined in\nintervals as small as we wish.\n\nThe algorithm that describes this method is:\n\n1. I0 = [a0,b0] = [a,b];\n\n2. Ik = [ak,bk] ,k = 1, 2, ..., and consider xk+1 the midpoint of the interval Ik,\n\nxk+1 =\nak + bk\n\n2\n(7.17)\n\nConsidering, in equation 7.17, that it is possible to define ak+1 = ak and bk+1 = xk+1,\nand, on the other hand define ak+1 = xk+1 and bk+1 = bk. In these two scenarios, a new\ninterval Ik = [ak+1,bk+1] is built, where the precise value that is wanted is contained.\nThe new subinterval has a length, that is half the length of the previous subinterval,\nwhich is shown in relation:\n\n|ak+1 ? bk+1| =\n1\n\n2\n|ak ? bk|. (7.18)\n\nIn summary, this method generates from the initial interval I0 = [a,b] successive\nintervals Ikk=1,2,... verifying I0 ? I1 ? I2...,, where there is an ? ? Ik,k = 0, 1, 2, ..., such\nthat f (?) = 0.\n\n7.4 Implementation\n\nIn the previous sections, the models used in the compaction and sintering stages were\ndemonstrated. Now, the kinetics of the two stages is presented, resorting to a schematic\nin figure 7.2, and the work developed in the implementation is explained with special\nfocus in the applied subroutines. All the research work was done resorting to a finite\nelement program and, essentially, using subroutines as auxiliary tools.\n\nBeginning on the compaction stage, the main goal was to compact the loose powder.\nFor compacting the loose powder the criteria of soils plasticity was applied. The main\ngoal was to study the density gradients at the end of the compaction stage, when the\nspecimen is free of rigid bodies. Therefore, to study the density gradients it was necessary\nto apply a subroutine, UVARM, on the model. It was important to save the densities\nin a database because in the second stage there is an input of the density gradients\nfrom the compaction stage. Therefore, a subroutine called WRITE was created for\nwriting the density values from every element in the final of compaction stage. At this\npoint, the compaction stage ends and the sintering stage begins. Before starting the\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n7.Implementation 75\n\nsintering stage an input of the information needed from the previous stage was made.\nThe orphan mesh and residual stresses were loaded from the compaction simulation.\nThese two informations were placed in the sintering input file. The density values written\nin database from the last increment of the compaction stage were also loaded for the\nsintering simulation. For loading the values, another subroutine, called READ, was\ncreated. This subroutine has the task of reading the values of density that were in\ndatabase. The READ subroutine was placed into the main subroutine CREEP. The\nsubroutine CREEP along with the subroutine READ and the information loaded from\nthe compaction stage were fundamental for creating the sintering simulation.\n\nIt is possible to see the previous explanation of the implementation work in schemat-\nically in figure 7.2. The user subroutines UVARM and CREEP are described more\ndetailed in sections 7.2.1 and 7.3.6.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n76 7.Implementation\n\nFigure 7.2: Schematic of the developed implementation.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n7.Implementation 77\n\n7.5 CREEP Subroutine Validation\n\nThe implemented models validation is crucial. For material models implemented using\nuser\u2019s subroutine (CREEP) is extremely important to perform some control tests. Thus,\nin a first phase, the CREEP subroutine is validated in a simple model. After the CREEP\nsubroutine is calibrated for this model, it is then applied in the case study presented in\nsection 8.2.\n\nTherefore, the test is realized in a specimen with a unitary dimension. For validating\nthis test, a minimum number of elements is applied just for avoiding locking effects. For\nthis test, four elements CAX4T were applied. This test consists in a displacement in\nthe vertical direction. The bottom of the specimen is restricted in x and y directions.\nFor testing the temperature field, a temperature starting at room temperature, around\n18 ?C and growing until to 1000 ?C is applied.\n\nHere, the main concern is to understand the subroutine\u2019s mechanical behaviour. So,\nthe creep and the swelling strain were taking into account for analysing the results,\nconsistency and verifying the implementation. The results are presented in a graphic\nway like shown in figure 7.4 and 7.5. They represent the swelling and creep strain control\nalong the heat cycle.\n\nFigure 7.3: Boundary conditions of the specimen.\n\nIn the initial tests, the values of swelling and creep strain were extremely exaggerated.\nThis was due to the material parameters not being in a coherent unit scale. After\ncalibrating the material parameters, new tests were performed, and a new problem in\ncalculating the porosity was identify. In a first phase, the porosity value was not correct,\nand with incorrect value in porosity, others parameters were influenced and with that,\nthe swelling and creep strain were also influenced. Therefore, a calibration of the iterative\nmethod for extracting the correct value of porosity was performed. With that, the creep\nand swelling values starting assuming the values as presented in figure 7.4 and 7.5.\n\nFurthermore, the swelling and creep strain represent the most important variables in\nthe subroutine CREEP. The swelling and creep strains increments are given by relations\n7.15 and 7.16 referred in section 7.3.6. The swelling strain is not represented in absolute\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n78 7.Implementation\n\nvalue, so assumes negative values, like represented in figure 7.4. In relation 7.15 it is\nobvious that the swelling strain is directly dependent of the equivalent pressure stress (p),\nof the sintering stress (?s) and of the viscosity modulus (?b). Therefore, in this test, an\ninitial pressure in the upper surface was applied, like shown in figure 7.3. This pressure\nwas applied with the objective to start the swelling strain behaviour at 0 seconds. If\nthis initial pressure did not exist the swelling strain would just start when the transition\ntemperature was reached, because that is when the sintering stress starts to have effect.\nAt this point, the interest is not in a typical sintering behaviour but in accurate values.\nIn the graphic 7.4, the swelling strain takes values relatively acceptable for this initial\ntest. So, it is also concluded that the viscosity modulus, which is influenced by the\nArrhenius equation is working well. The sintering cycle does not have much influence in\nthis test, because it was just given a ramp of heating to 1000 ?C and the sintering stress\njust starts to work at 918 ?C. So, the control on the sintering stress may not be accurate.\n\nThe creep strain is dependent on the equivalent deviatoric stress and on the shear\nmodulus. Like was explained in the swelling strain, applying an initial pressure influenced\nthe creep strain. The creep strain\u2019s behaviour, like in the swelling strain, starts at 0\nseconds influenced by the equivalent deviatoric stress. Here, the concern was to control\nthe shear modulus, that is given by the porosity and Arrhenius equation. Therefore, the\ncontrol in the creep strain was precise in the porosity and in the Arrhenius equation.\nSo, while for the swelling strain the adjustments had to be made, in the creep strain this\nwas not necessary.\n\nThis validation test was mainly general, not fully demonstrating the actual influence\nof the CREEP subroutine in the sintering process simulation. Here, the objective was\nfor adjusting material parameters, adjusting the units, calculating the porosity with the\nbisection method and observing how the creep and swelling strain behave. In fact, there\nis not a reference value for comparing the values presented in figure 7.4 and 7.5, so they\nwere assumed correct for implementing the creep subroutine in the case study.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n7.Implementation 79\n\nFigure 7.4: Swelling strain behaviour along the heat step.\n\nFigure 7.5: Creep strain behaviour along the heat step.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n80 7.Implementation\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\nPart III\n\nResults and Discussion\n\n81\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nProblem Description and\nDiscretization\n\n8.1 Introduction\n\nIn this chapter, the geometrical model is discretized, where the compaction and sin-\ntering models presented in sections 7.2 and 7.3, were validated. It starts with simple\ngeometries, for validating a material model, like described in subsection 7.3.6. Most of\nthe geometrical models used for validating subroutines like the one used in this work\n(CREEP subroutine) are axisymmetrical models. Usually, the geometrical model is a\nsimple disk, that is subjected to a compaction test and, subsequently, to a sintering\nprocess. The disk could have a simple geometry, i.e., without an interior section or be\nmore complex and have a cavity. For this work, it is also adopted a simple disk, without\nany cavity, because it is the most used geometrical model for beginning studies in this\nfield.\n\nFurthermore it is also important to describe the model in what comes to the level\nof steps and boundary conditions applied in the finite element program. As it was\nsaid along this work, it is important to define the problem in a compaction process\nand in a sintering process. Firstly, the boundary conditions in the compaction process\nare presented. These are mainly mechanical conditions and are presented in subsection\n8.2.1. Following on, the thermal conditions used in the sintering process are presented\nin section 8.2.2.\n\n8.2 Case study\n\nThe model adopted for implementing all the concepts that were described in previous\nchapters was an axisymmetric model, more specifically a cylindrical specimen as shown\nin figure 8.1.\n\n8.2.1 Compaction Simulation\n\nIn the specimen shown in figure 8.1, an elasto-plastic criteria based on the modified\nDrucker-Prager/Cap described in 7.2 was implemented. A user\u2019s UVARM subroutine\n\n83\n\n\n\n84 8.Problem Description and Discretization\n\nFigure 8.1: Specimen geometry, adapted from [1].\n\nwas also implemented and is described in 7.2.1. These two topics, explained in chapter\n7, describe the material behaviour along the compaction simulation.\n\nUniaxial die compaction in a single act was applied in the loose powder. Therefore,\nthe upper punch performs the movement of compressing the loose powder. The lower\npunch and the die do not move along the process of compaction, except in the end of\nthe of compaction stage, when the powder is already compacted and the punches release\nthe green body.\n\nFor simulating the compaction process 3 steps were necessary, and each one had a\nrelative time of 1 second. In the first step the tools were assigned. The objective here\nwas to reproduce the contact of the punches and of the die cavity with the loose powder\n(the specimen). Therefore, an interaction on the die surface with the specimen was\nused and the condition for the lower and upper punches was applied. In the compaction\nsimulation process, the rigid tool that simulates the lower punch for holding the specimen\nwas substituted for a boundary condition, where the displacement in the z ?direction\nwas restricted. In the second step, the compaction movement was realized, this is, the\nupper punch realized the movement of compression on the loose powder. In this step, the\nloose powder gained the shape of the die cavity. For that, a displacement in the upper\nsurface was applied to simulate the movement of the punch compacting the specimen.\nAt last, in step 3 the tools were released, and left the specimen relaxation. In this\nstep, the movement of the upper punch was deactivated. A displacement was applied\nin the die surface with 3 mm in the r ? direction and the lower punch stayed, with\nthe boundary condition of the first step applied, in the bottom of the specimen. In\nfigure 9.19, the movements of the tools in the simulation of the compaction process are\ngraphically represented .\n\nLike was said in the previous paragrapher, in an attempt to simplify the compaction\nsimulation process, the upper punch and the lower punch were substituted for rota-\ntion/displacement boundary conditions. This solution simplified the global convergence\nof the simulation, because the contact interactions were limited to the die and the spec-\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n8.Problem Description and Discretization 85\n\nimen, where there is a real interest in understanding the friction between these two\nsurfaces. Therefore, the convergence in contact interactions is faster, simplifying the\nglobal convergence of the problem. For the compaction simulation, the boundary con-\nditions and loading conditions are represented in figure 8.2.\n\nFigure 8.2: Boundary conditions for single acting compaction process, adapted from [27].\n\nFigure 8.3: Movement of the punches.\n\nThe case study presented in figure 8.1 is an axisymmetric specimen, thus, the element\ntypes available are restricted to axisymmetric elements. In axisymmetric problems, it\nis necessary to consider that coordinate 1 is r and coordinate 2 is z. At ? = 0 the\nr ?direction corresponds to the global x?direction and z ?direction corresponds to\nthe global y ?direction. This is important when data is given in global directions [26].\nSo, the element type applied in this case study was a continuum stress/displacement,\naxisymmetric with nonlinear and 4 nodes bilinear that defines the element CAX4. It was\nselected complete integration instead of reduced integration because the accuracy with\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n86 8.Problem Description and Discretization\n\ncomplete integration is better than with reduced integration. In reduced integration,\nthere is just one point of calculation in all the element, therefore the computation time\nis faster comparatively to complete integration which has four points of calculation in\nall the element.\n\nFigure 8.4: Specimen meshed with CAX4 elements.\n\nWith the objective of having an accurate simulation, in a first phase an intermediate\nmesh was established, i.e., neither a coarse mesh, that leads to low accuracy results,\nneither a mesh with excessive elements, that requires a larger computational time. For\nthis case study a mesh with 648 elements and 700 nodes was used, concluding that will\nbe the most adequate mesh to obtain results.\n\n8.2.2 Sintering Simulation\n\nIn the sintering process simulation, the geometry adopted was imported from the com-\npaction process simulation. Therefore, after the compaction simulation the model is\npassed to the sintering simulation. In practical terms, the specimen where the sintering\nbehaviour is applied is shown in figure 8.5.\n\nFigure 8.5: Geometry for the sintering simulation.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n8.Problem Description and Discretization 87\n\nThe boundary conditions applied on the green body are divided into two parts, as\nexpressed by:\n\n? = ?c + ?f, (8.1)\n\nwhere ? is the total surfaces of the sintering body, ?c is the surfaces contacted with the\nsurface of the chamber, ?f is the free surfaces exposed in the sintering atmosphere [9].\nEquation 8.1 is illustrated in figure 8.6.\n\nFigure 8.6: Description of boundaries in the sinterning model.\n\nRelatively to thermal boundary conditions it is established that the temperature of\nthe sintering body changes with the thermal cycle in the furnace. The parts absorb\nthe heat via thermal conduction, convection and radiation. The thermal boundary\nconditions can be expressed as:\n\n?X???,T = f\n(\nX?,t\n\n)\n, (8.2)\n\nwhere f\n(\nX?,t\n\n)\nis the temperature distribution function, X? is the spatial position in the\n\nmodel and t is the time. For the sintering of small components, the temperature gradients\nin the sintering body are small unless the heating process is very quick. However, there\nare, usually, temperature gradients in the furnace [9].\n\nThe sintering process simulation were divided in two steps defined by coupled temp-\ndisplacement. In the first step, the heating ramp and the holding time were applied, so\nthis step had a time period of approximately 11592 seconds corresponding to 2 hours and\n20 minutes of heating ramp at 10 ?C and 1 hour of holding time. The second step is the\ncooling step, where another 2 hours and 20 minutes of cooling ramp were applied. The\ntwo steps applied in this sintering process simulation have basis on the ideal sintering\ncycle shown in figure 8.7.\n\nRelatively to the mesh of the specimen in the sintering simulation, as was previously\nreferred, the geometry was imported from the compaction simulation. So, the mesh was\nalso imported from the compaction stage. Therefore, after the compaction simulation\nfinished the deformed mesh is imported to the sintering simulation, so the number of\nnodes and elements stays constant. The only change is due to the type of element.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n88 8.Problem Description and Discretization\n\nFigure 8.7: The ideal sintering cycle applied in the sintering process simulation, adapted\nfrom [1].\n\nFor sintering simulation, a coupled thermal/displacement element like the CAX4T was\napplied. This element is characterized for 4-node bilinear displacement temperature.\n\n8.3 Model Validation\n\nAfter all descriptions presented in previous sections about the implementation of powder\nmetallurgy, it is now necessary to validate the model. Therefore, an initial validation\nwith a single element in the disk model in section 8.2 was conducted considering all the\nconditions explained in subsections 8.2.1 and 8.2.2. This validation test is essential before\nstarting the analysis of the model with all sensibility considerations. It is not possible to\nvalidate the compaction and sintering model for an exhaustive analysis if the model is\nnot controlled for the simplest case. After an initial validation and understanding that\nall the mechanisms implemented are properly controlled, it follows the same proceeding\nfor the disk case.\n\nThis validation process starts with the compaction process simulation. The model\nof compaction is presented in figure 8.8. In this first part of the work it is necessary\nto interact the UVARM subroutine with the compaction simulation, with the objective\nto control the density increase along the compaction process. Other variables like von\nMises stresses, and total strains are also important to take into account.\n\nThe control made in this phase was about the variables that were necessary to mon-\nitor in the compaction process. Therefore the control of relative density (figure 8.9),\nplastic volumetric strain (figure 8.10) and axial pressure (figure 8.11) is presented.\n\nIn figure 8.9, the relative density behaviour increased as expected. The relative den-\nsity increased, essentially, during the second step, when the loose powder was compacted.\nThe increase in relative density, is intimately related with the plastic volumetric strain.\nTherefore, when the plastic volumetric strain started to increase the relative density\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n8.Problem Description and Discretization 89\n\nFigure 8.8: Compaction model for the validation test.\n\nFigure 8.9: Relative Density along the compaction process simulation.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n90 8.Problem Description and Discretization\n\nFigure 8.10: Plastic volumetric strain behaviour in the compaction process simulation.\n\nFigure 8.11: Axial stress behaviour in the compaction process.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n8.Problem Description and Discretization 91\n\nalso started increasing. The plastic volumetric strain behaviour (figure 8.10) matched\nperfectly with the relative density behaviour (figure 8.9). Finally, in this validation test,\nthe axial stress was verified. The axial stress (figure 8.11) had the expected behaviour,\nthis is, it increased along the compaction movement, and decreased when the compact\nis released. Hence, the compaction simulation model had the expected behaviour, and\nwere created conditions in the compact for starting the sintering process simulation.\n\nAfter controlling the model in the compaction process simulation, it is now necessary\nto control the model in the sintering stage. The sintering stage is more critical than the\ncompaction stage because there are some material variables to control. Therefore, a\nfirst approach was made in subsection 7.5 for controlling the model material variables\n(CREEP subroutine), but for a insignificantly example. In this stage, the objective is to\ncontrol the sintering variables for 1 element model for controlling the CREEP subroutine,\nbut for a sintering process done after the compaction stage. Therefore, two variables,\nin specific, were controlled: the swelling and creep strain that are essential for the good\nbehaviour of the sintering process simulation. After this control, just for prevention, the\nrelative density was analysed, demonstrating that the relative density still increases in\nthe sintering process.\n\nIt is noted in figure 8.12 and 8.13 that the strains had an acceptable behaviour for the\nimplemented material model. At this point, it was not an objective to enter in details\nabout the behaviour of these two strains, but it is noted that the swelling and creep\nstrains started increasing when the Arrhenius equation had influence in the sintering\nprocess and the porosity started decreasing with the beginning of grain growth. This\nled to the start of the relative density in the sintering process simulation.\n\nFigure 8.12: Swelling strain during the sintering process simulation.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n92 8.Problem Description and Discretization\n\nFigure 8.13: Creep strain during the sintering process simulation.\n\nFigure 8.14: Relative density increases during the sintering process simulation.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nCase Study Analysis\n\n9.1 Introduction\n\nAfter all implementation tests were validated, it is now time for validating the model\nwith the necessary conditions for a careful analysis in the compaction process simulation\n(section 9.2), and in the sintering process simulation (section 9.3). All the model dis-\ncretization was done in chapter 8. This chapter is essentially presented for an assertive\ndiscussion of results. In a first phase, the compaction stage and the following sintering\nstage are discussed in detail. First, this discussion is focused on the accuracy of the\nmesh, like was explained in section 8.2.1, where four selected elements were analized\n(figure 9.1). Following, a sensitivity study is made (section 9.4), where the objective is\nnow focused on the mesh accuracy.\n\n9.2 Compaction Stage Analysis\n\nIn order to start the compaction stage analysis, the centroids of four elements of the\nmesh applied on the specimen were chosen. The elements selected for this analysis can\nbe seen in figure 9.1.\n\nFigure 9.1: Four critical elements selected.\n\n93\n\n\n\n94 9.Case Study Analysis\n\nThe initial relative density is established at 0.381. When the compaction process\nbegins, the relative density behaviour tends to increase, i.e., when the upper punch\nstarts the downward movement, the density automatically starts to increase.\n\nInitially, there is a completely porous body. At the beginning of the process, the die\ncavity is filled with metallic powder so, the porosity is high and the density is low. At\nthe moment in which the metallic powder starts to be compacted the void spaces start\nbeing less, the porosity starts decreasing and the density increasing until the porous\nspecimen or green body with the shape of the die cavity is obtained. In figure 9.2, it is\npossible to see the initial dimensions of the specimen (the contour line in black) and the\ndimensions in the final of the compaction stage (the green body with mesh applied). As\nit is possible see in the legend, the displacement is around 9 mm, so the specimen was\ncompacted to half of the initial heigh.\n\nFigure 9.2: The compaction stage, at the beginning and at the end of the process.\n\nThe relative density (RD) gradients at the end of the compaction stage, i.e., after the\nloose powder is compacted and the tools released, are shown at figure 9.4. For comparing,\nit is shown in figure 9.3 the plastic volumetric strain (?\n\npl\nv ) at the end of compaction\n\nstage. The two parameters are intimately connected by relation 2.13. Therefore, the\ntwo behaviours are shown in figure 9.3 and 9.4.\n\nAs it is possible to see in figure 9.4, the relative density assumes values around 0.6.\nIn fact, looking at figure 9.4, it is noticed that the values of relative density do not\nchange significantly. The relative density presents its higher value in the superior right\nvortex of the specimen. This value is high in that zone because it is, supposedly, the\nlocal where the specimen is in contact with the die wall and, at the same time, with\nthe upper punch vortex that practises the compaction movement. This, associated with\nthe friction between the specimen and the die wall, reflects the higher relative density\nvalue in that zone. On the other hand, the lowest relative density value is located in the\nright bottom vortex of the specimen, where it is in contact with the lower punch vortex\nand the die wall. Due to the lower punch function of holding the specimen while the\nupper punch compacts the specimen, and to the friction between the die wall and the\nspecimen, lower values of relative density are obtained at the bottom of the specimen.\n\nFor a better analysis of the density, a short study about the density behaviour in the\nelements was made, which is shown in figure 9.1. This study is addressed in figures 9.5,\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 95\n\nFigure 9.3: Plastic volumetric strain (?\npl\nv ) at the end of compaction stage.\n\nFigure 9.4: Density gradients after compaction stage.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n96 9.Case Study Analysis\n\n9.6, 9.7 and 9.8.\n\nFigure 9.5: Evolution of relative density during the compaction stage.\n\nLooking at figure 9.5, it was noticed that while the plastic volumetric strain did not\nstart, the initial relative density stayed constant. The first step, is a step for establishing\ncontact of the tools with the specimen and for applying the boundary conditions, which\nexplains why the relative density did not change until the step time of 1.\n\nIn the second step time, the upper punch started its movement for compacting the\nloose powder, therefore, the plastic volumetric strain started. With the beginning of the\nvolumetric plastic strain, the relative density started to increase. After the compaction\nprocess finished, i.e., after the specimen was converted to half of its original height, the\nrelative density turned to a constant value during the release of the tools. This can be\nseen in figure 9.5 in the step time from 2 to 3.\n\nIn figure 9.6, it is possible to verify that during the compaction process of loose pow-\nder, the density is increasing at the same time that the axial stress increases. Therefore,\nhigh densities occur when axial stress assumes high values. Note that for obtaining a\ncompaction of 50% of the initial height, an axial stress between 160 MPa and 170 MPa\nis necessary. This happens in the compaction loading process. In the unloading process\nthe specimen is released from the tools and the axial stress turns to zero.\n\nIn figure 9.7, it is verified that in the loading phase the maximum value of axial\npressure is registered when the volumetric plastic strain is maximum. This is coherent\nwith what is seen in figure 9.6, since relative density and plastic volumetric strain are in-\ntimately related. So, figures 9.6 and 9.7 show the same behaviour during the compaction\nstage.\n\nIn figure 9.8, the stress relatively to step time is analysed. As it is possible to see in\nfigure 9.8, the stress increases exponentially during the compaction stage, i.e, the stress\nincreases during the loading process. The stress reaches its maximum at the end of\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 97\n\nFigure 9.6: Behaviour of density with axial stress.\n\nFigure 9.7: Densification behaviour.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n98 9.Case Study Analysis\n\nFigure 9.8: von Mises stress during compaction stage.\n\nloading stress. After that, the unloading process starts and the stress decreases linearly\nremaining, at the end, the residual stress.\n\n9.3 Sintering Stage Analysis\n\nIn this section, the behaviour of the specimen during the sintering is analysed. Here, the\nspecimen ended the compaction stage and is at the beginning of the sintering. Therefore,\nthe variables that influence directly the sintering are analysed. For that, the sintering\ncycle is considered to be the reference cycle for this study. Looking at figure 9.1, the\nanalysis will be made in four elements of the specimen, the same elements that were\nanalysed in the compaction model.\n\nIt starts for analysing the contour plot of the density gradients. Thus, in figure\n9.9, the density gradients at the beginning of the sintering process simulation (the same\ngradients as in the end of the compaction stage) and the density gradients at the end\nof the sintering process simulation (after occurring coarsening and densification) are\npresented.\n\nNext, the sintering stress is presented (figure 9.10) which affects the specimen during\nthe sintering. Here, is presented the sintering stress that affects the specimen at the\ntransition temperature in the heating ramp and at the transition temperature in the\ncooling ramp.\n\nThe stresses at the beginning of the sintering process are the residual stresses coming\nfrom the compaction stage. In the sintering process simulation, the residual stresses are\nmainly affected by thermal effects. In figure 9.11 it is possible to see the stresses at the\nbeginning of the compaction stage and the residual stress at the end of the sintering\nstress simulation.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 99\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 9.9: Evolution of density gradients during sintering (a) Density gradients at the\nbeginning of the sintering cycle (b) Density gradients at the end of sintering cycle.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n100 9.Case Study Analysis\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 9.10: Sintering stress behaviour, (a) at the transition temperature during the\nheating ramp (b) at the transition temperature during cooling ramp.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 101\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 9.11: von Mises stresses, (a) at the beginning of the sintering stage (b) at end of\nthe sintering cycle.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n102 9.Case Study Analysis\n\nThe specimen temperature field at the beginning of the sintering process is at room\ntemperature 20 ?C (293 K). As the temperature increases, the compact temperature field\nstops being an homogeneous field and starts to be an heterogeneous field as figure 9.12\nshows. Naturally, the edges that are directly in contact with the sintering atmosphere\nheat faster than the internal compact (figure 9.12 (a)). On the other hand, during the\ncooling ramp the internal compact tends to have a slower cooling rate than the edges in\ndirect contact with the sintering atmosphere (figure 9.12 (b)).\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 9.12: Tempeature field: (a) during the heating ramp (b) during the cooling ramp.\n\nThe grain size is one of the properties that directly affects the compact during sin-\ntering. It is necessary to control the grain growth, for minimizing its influence in the\ndensification of the specimen. At the beginning of the sintering stage, the compact grain\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 103\n\nsize was considered to be homogeneous (4.36 \u00b5m). At the heating ramp, until the transi-\ntion temperature is not reached, the grain growth did not affect the sintering. After the\ntransition temperature is reached, the grain starts growing. In the end of the sintering\nstage, the grain growth is given by the contour plot presented in figure 9.13. Observing\nfigure 9.13 it can be concluded that grain size is bigger in zones that are closer to the\nsintering atmosphere. In the interior zones of the specimen, the grain size is smaller.\nHowever, general, at the end of sintering, the specimen has an homogeneous grain size\nvalue, around (39\u00b5m).\n\nFigure 9.13: Grain size at the end of the sintering stage.\n\nFocus now on the study made in four different elements of the same mesh. It was\nadopted the four critical elements considered in the compaction analysis (figure 9.1). In\nthis phase, the axial shrinkage study (figure 9.14), the relative density behaviour during\nthe sintering stage (figure 9.15), and the stress studies, the sintering stress (figure 9.16)\nand von Mises stresses are presented (figure 9.17).\n\nIn figure 9.14, independently on the element in analysis, the general shrinkage be-\nhaviour starts with a volume expansion (when shrinkage takes negative values it means\nan expansion takes place, when shrinkage takes positive values occurs contraction). This\nhappens because the specimen has initially accumulated the residual stresses from the\ncompaction process, and also it is also affected by the initially heating ramp, where the\nthermal expansion effects are more pronounced. Therefore, there is a smooth expansion\nat the beginning of the sintering cycle. This smooth expansion is more noticeable in\nelements 1 and 24 and it remains to temperatures around 918 ?C. At 918 ?C, which is\ncalled the transition temperature, is the turning point of expansion to contraction. It\nis more noticeable in elements 1 and 24, where at 918 ?C the expansion stopped and\ncontraction started. In 625 and 648, the contraction started even before the transition\npoint. However, after the transition point, it was noted that the expansion was predom-\ninant in the four elements. The expansion increases dramatically after the transition\ntemperature until 1200 ?C. This increase is due to the increase in sintering stress, as\nshown in figure 9.16. After 1200 ?C, the sintering stress starts to decrease because the\nactivation energy for grain growth shifts to a lower level and the grain growth rate starts\nto increase.\n\nFigure 9.15 shows the predicted relative density change during sintering. It is con-\ncluded that relative density did not change in the initial heating ramp and in the final\ncooling ramp. These are zones dominated by thermal expansion/contraction. The rel-\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n104 9.Case Study Analysis\n\nFigure 9.14: Axial shrinkage curves in function of time.\n\nFigure 9.15: Relative density curves predicted by FEM model for Stainless Steel 316L\npowder compacts.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 105\n\nFigure 9.16: Sintering stress changes during sintering.\n\nFigure 9.17: von Mises stress during the sintering process.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n106 9.Case Study Analysis\n\native density started to increase when the swelling strain started to be relevant in the\nsintering cycle. The relative density increased when the transition temperature was\nreached in the heating ramp final phase, it still increased during the holding time, and\nwhen the cooling ramp started the relative density started to smoothly keeping constant,\nand after the transition temperature at the cooling ramp it simply did not increase any-\nmore. The final relative density reached around 0.8. The element 648 is where the final\ndensity reached the highest value, around 0.84.\n\nLooking into figure 9.16, it is shown that sintering stress had the same behaviour\nindependently of the element. The element 648 is the only which has taken higher values.\nThe sintering stress only affect the sintering process when the transition temperature\nis reached. After 918 ?C and until 1200 ?C the sintering stress increases. The sintering\nstress increases due to the grain size maintaining constant in this interval. At 1200 ?C,\nthe sintering stress starts decreasing dramatically because the grains start to grow. From\nthe material model implemented, it is known that the sintering stress is proportional to\nthe reciprocal grain size. In the cooling ramp, the sintering stress is only affected by\nthe relative density slowly increasing until the temperature drops down to the transition\ntemperature and sintering stress stops influencing the sintering stage.\n\nIn figure 9.17, it is demonstrated how the von Mises stress behaves along the sin-\ntering stage. At the beginning of the sintering cycle, the von Mises stress assumes the\nvalues from the residual stress of the compaction stage. The von Mises stress reaches a\nmaximum value at the beginning and starts smoothly decreasing while the temperature\nstarts increasing. At this point the sintering stage is dominated by the thermal expan-\nsion. Closer to the transition temperature, the sintering stress starts to dominate the\nstresses in the sintering stage, and the von Mises stresses dramatically decrease. After\nthe transition temperature and during the holding time and the cooling ramp where the\nsintering stresses dominate, the von Mises stresses assume values near 0. In the end of\nthe sintering cycle, the sintering stress desappears and residual values for the von Mises\nstress appear. At the end, the von Mises stresses assumes a very low value.\n\n9.4 Sensitivity Analysis\n\nIn this section, it is reproduced a sensitivity analysis, which objective is to study the\nmesh influence in the obtained results. Therefore, it was a study in the compaction and\nsintering stages was made where, at each process, three different meshes were applied:\na coarse mesh; an intermediate mesh and a refined mesh. A coarse mesh with 132\nelements; the intermediate mesh from the mesh used in the case study was adopted\nand it was described in subsection 8.2.1. The intermediate mesh is defined with 648\nelements. Finally, a refined mesh with 957 elements was applied. The elements\u2019 difference\nbetween the intermediate and refined meshes is not so accented as between the coarse\nand intermediate meshes. Therefore, the results\u2019 difference between the intermediate and\nrefined meshes may not be so significant. For the coarse mesh, the elements analysed\nis represented in figure 9.9 (a). The intermediate mesh, like said before, was adopted\nfrom the case study, therefore, the elements analysed are represented in figure 9.1 from\nsection 9.2. Finally, in the refined mesh, the analysed element are represented in figure\n9.18 (b). Firstly, the mesh influence in the compaction stage is analysed, after the same\nanalysis is done but for the sintering stage.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 107\n\n(a) Coarse mesh with the four elements referenced.\n\n(b) Refined mesh with the four elements referenced.\n\nFigure 9.18: The different meshes applied in the sensitivity analysis.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n108 9.Case Study Analysis\n\n9.4.1 Compaction Sensitivity Analysis\n\nIn this sensitivity analysis some parameters that were analysed in the compaction stage\nare presented (section 9.2) but now influenced by different meshes. Therefore, a study\nwas made, where four groups of elements were analysed: element 1; elements 11, 24 and\n29; elements 122, 625 and 929; elements 132, 648 and 957 from figures 9.18 (a); 9.4 and\n9.18 (b), respectively. This elements are analysed in the study of the mesh influence\nrelatively to the punch force for compacting the loose powder, the von Mises stress and\naxial stress in function of relative density. Firstly, a study is presented about the force\nnecessary to compress the loose powder for half of initial height, like was presented in\nfigure 8.5. In the punch force study, it was analysed how the reaction force behaved in\neach node of the upper edge. The analysis is presented in figure 9.19.\n\nFollowing, the behaviour of the von Mises stress along the relative time is presented\nin figures 9.20 and 9.21. Figure 9.20 presents the two upper edge elements from figure\n9.18, and figure 9.21 presents the study of the two bottom elements, also from figure\n9.18. This architecture of results\u2019 presentation is maintained for the study of the next\nparameters that are presented in this section. The number of graphics presented in this\nchapter is very exhaustive due to a coherency question of maintaining the decision of\nanalysing the four critical elements like was made in sections 9.2 and 9.3. Therefore,\nin each parameter analysed, there are four graphics corresponding to each of the four\nelements for the three different meshes.\n\nIn figures 9.22 and 9.23, the evolution of the axial stress in function of the relative\ndensity is presented. Figure 9.22 presents the two elements of the upper edge and figure\n9.23 presents the two elements of the bottom edge.\n\nFigure 9.19: Punch force analysis in fuction of mesh types.\n\nIn figure 9.19 it is possible to observe the punch force evolution as long as the\nloose powder is pressed. Once again, it is necessary to explain that, for simplifying\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 109\n\n(a) von Mises stress analysis for element 1 with different refined meshes.\n\n(b) von Mises stress analysis for elements 11; 24 and 29 for different refined meshes.\n\nFigure 9.20: von Mises stress for the two first elements.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n110 9.Case Study Analysis\n\n(a) von Mises stress analysis for elements 122, 625 and 929 with different refined\nmeshes.\n\n(b) von Mises stress analysis for elements 132; 648 and 957 for different refined\nmeshes.\n\nFigure 9.21: von Mises stress for the two last elements.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 111\n\n(a) Axial stress evolution along the relative density increasing in element 1 for\ndifferent mesh types.\n\n(b) Axial stress evolution along the relative density increasing in elements 11; 24\nand 29 for different mesh types.\n\nFigure 9.22: Axial stress evolution along the relative density for the elements in the\nupper edge.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n112 9.Case Study Analysis\n\n(a) Axial stress evolution along the relative density increasing in elements 122; 625\nand 929 for different mesh types.\n\n(b) Axial stress evolution along the relative density increasing in elements 132; 648\nand 957 for different mesh types.\n\nFigure 9.23: Axial stress evolution along the relative density for the elements in the\nbottom edge.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 113\n\nthe problem, the upper punch, which is responsible to compress the loose powder, was\nsubstituted for a displacement condition in the upper surface of the specimen in the finite\nelement program. Therefore, it explains the fact that when a displacement of 9 mm is\nreached, an abrupt decrease from a maximum force to 0 happens because when it reaches\n9 mm the displacement conduction is inactivated. However, analysing figure 9.19 it is\npossible to conclude that the force necessary for pressing the powder increases along the\ndisplacement, and the maximum force is reached at 9 mm, when the compaction ends.\nThis is the general punch force behaviour independently of the mesh type.\n\nRelatively to the mesh influence, it is noticed that with a refined mesh the maximum\nforce necessary to compact the disk to half of the initial heigh is approximately 4.5 kN,\nor, in other terms, it is necessary approximately 450 kgf to compress the loose powder.\nIn the intermediate mesh, the maximum force increases to approximately 5.5 kN, which\nis approximately 550 kgf. The major difference is in the coarse mesh, with few elements,\na punch force much higher than in the intermediate and refined meshes is recorder. In\nthe coarse mesh it is registered around 11 kN for compacting the powder, so, it takes\nabout 1.1 ton to compress the powder. For this analysis, it is concluded that when\nthe mesh is more refined, more accurate is the value relatively to the force imposed for\ncompacting the powder. Therefore, for the mesh with most accuracy, the lowest is the\nforce needed for compacting the loose powder.\n\nFocus now in the von Mises stress along the compaction process evolution. The\ncurves\u2019 behaviour, in figures 9.20 and 9.21, was already discussed in section 9.2. Here,\nthe objective is to understand if the mesh types have different behaviours. As can be\nseen in figure 9.20 (a) for the element 1, it is evident that the three different meshes: the\ncoarse mesh; the intermediate mesh and the refined mesh; do not have a big difference\nbetween them. The three curves have the same behaviour along the compaction process,\nand this conclusion is a constant for figures 9.20 (a) and (b) and 9.21 (a) and (b). In the\nelement 1 (figure 9.20 (a)) the intermediate and refined meshes reach the von Mises stress\nmaximum at around the same value, 109 MPa for the intermediate mesh, and 110 MPa\nfor the refined mesh. The coarse mesh takes a lower value, around 106 MPa. It is noticed\nthat the intermediate and refined meshes assumes higher values relatively to the coarse\nmesh at the relative time from 2 to 3. In the elements 11, 24 and 29 (figure 9.20 (b)) the\nthree different meshes had the same behaviour, they reached their maximum at around\n97 MPa. During the relative time from 1 to 2, there are some differences but they are\ninsignificant, because it is during the compression process period. In the elements 122,\n625 and 929 (figure 9.21 (a)) it is possible to see that the coarse mesh assumes higher\nvalues relatively to the intermediate and refined meshes. Along the compaction process,\nthe coarse mesh has a von Mises maximum of 91 MPa higher than the intermediate\nand refined meshes, which have 88 MPa. In the ejection period from 2 to 3 the coarse\nmesh still takes higher values relatively to the intermediate and refined meshes. For the\nelements 132, 648 and 957, the same behaviour as in figure 9.20 (b) can be seen. There is\nno significant difference between the three meshes. All the three meshes assume the von\nMises maximum at 100 MPa and the ejection step from 2 to 3 has the same behaviour.\nIn conclusion, it is interesting that the elements analysed close to the symmetric line\nhave the same behaviour, in other words, do not have any change with the different\nmeshes. On the other hand, the elements close to the die surface are where the refined\nor coarse meshes have a detached behaviour in relation to the other mesh. The von\nMises stress is higher in the element 1 and elements 132, 648 and 957, and the von Mises\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n114 9.Case Study Analysis\n\nstress is lower at elements 11, 24 and 29, and elements 122, 625 and 929.\n\nAnother study made for verifying the mesh sensitivity at the compaction stage was\nthe relation between the increasing axial stress versus the relative density. Figure 9.22\nshows the two elements\u2019 behaviour in the upper surface and in figure 9.23 the two\nelements\u2019 behaviour in the bottom surface is shown. In the study of element 1, (figure\n9.22 (a)) it is shown that the three different meshes have a similar behaviour. In the\nloading phase, the axial stress increases as well as the relative density. In the unloading\nphase, the displacement of the upper punch was deactivated and the axial stress started\nto decrease down to a residual value. The coarse mesh had its axial stress maximum at\n172 MPa for a relative density of 0.634. The intermediate and the refined meshes have\ntheir maximum axial stress value at 175 MPa for a relative density of 0.636. Therefore,\nthe mesh influence is not significant for this type of study. It is concluded that in\nthe element 1, the coarse mesh registered the lowest value but it was very close to the\nvalues registered in the intermediate and refined meshes. The elements 11, 24 and 29\n(figure 9.22 (b)) have the same behaviour of the figure 9.22 (a) therefore, the conclusion\npresented previously is maintained for this study of mesh influence. In the elements\n122, 625 and 929 (figure 9.23 (a)) it is shown that the axial stress assumes lower values\nthan in figure 9.23. However, it is perfectly normal due to being analysed the elements\nare the ones in the bottom of the sample. It is noticed that the coarse mesh assumes\nhigher values in the loading phase but it is the refined mesh that has the lowest relative\ndensity value in the end. The coarse mesh has an axial stress maximum of 153 MPa\nfor a relative density of 0.620. The intermediate mesh has an axial stress maximum of\n150 MPa for a relative density of 0.620 and the refined mesh has an axial stress maximum\nof 148 MPa for a relative density of 0.617. Once again, there are some differences but\nnothing very significant. The three different meshes still have a similar behaviour, and\nin figure 9.23 (a) it is the refined mesh that assumes the lowest value for the axial stress\nand corresponding relative density. In the elements 132, 648 and 957 the behaviour is\nas shown in figure 9.22 (a). During the loading, the coarse mesh presents the highest\nvalues. For the coarse mesh, it presents the axial stress maximum at 163 MPa for a\nrelative density of 0.626. The intermediate mesh and the refined mesh also present the\naxial stress maximum at 163 MPa but for the intermediate mesh the relative density is\naround 0.631 and in the refined mesh it is around 0.626. Thus, the discrepancy, here, is\nin the intermediate mesh that assumes the same value of axial stress maximum but for\na relatively high density in relation to the coarse and refined meshes.\n\nIn the compaction stage were these parameters presented previously, for studying the\ninfluence of mesh type in the behaviour of von Mises stress, the axial stress with relative\ndensity and the punch force. It was verified that in the punch force the difference in\nmesh type influences the values. However, in the von Mises stress and in the axial stress\nversus relative density the difference was minimum.\n\n9.4.2 Sintering Sensitivity Analysis\n\nIn this subsection it is presented the relevant parameters in the sintering stage for a\nsensitivity analysis relatively to the mesh type. All the assumptions presented in sections\n9.4 and 9.4.1, and the form in which the results are presented remains the same in this\nsubsection.\n\nFirstly, it is presented the axial shrinkage evolution along the time. Here, like was\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\n9.Case Study Analysis 115\n\nmade in the case study, the results are presented always in relation to the sintering\ncycle. In figure 9.24 (a) and (b) the axial shrinkage evolution for the two elements of\nthe upper surface is shown. On the other hand in figure 9.25 (a) and (b), the axial\nshrinkage evolution for the two elements of the bottom surface is shown. Another study\nis performed to understand the relative density along the sintering cycle with different\nmeshes and it is shown in figure 9.26 (a) and (b) and figure 9.27 (a) and (b). Finally, in\nthis sensitivity study, an analysis with the three different meshes on the sintering stress\nis made. The results with different mesh types are presented in figure 9.28 and in figure\n9.29.\n\nThe description of the typical axial shrinkage curve behaviour was made in section\n9.3, therefore it is not the main objective to explain the curve behaviour but rather\nexplain whether the meshes have a major or a minor influence in the axial shrinkage.\nStarting by analysing the figure 9.24 (a), where it is shown that the three meshes curves\ndemonstrated an initial expansion in the compact until the transition temperature was\nreached. After that, the three curves start the contraction behaviour, and at the end of\nthe sintering cycle the coarse mesh has the highest axial shrinkage value corresponding to\n8.49%. The intermediate mesh reaches an axial shrinkage value of 8.38% and the refined\nmesh has an axial shrinkage of 8.19%. Thus, the axial shrinkage, for a coarse mesh,\ntakes a higher value than for a refined mesh. The difference is not very large but in the\nelement 1, the refined mesh gives the lowest axial shrinkage value which should be more\nproperly. In elements 11; 24 and 29, the three different meshes have the same behaviour\nas in figure 9.24 (a). Starting with an expansion until the transition temperature and\nbeginning the contraction after the transition temperature. In figure 9.24 (b), the refined\nmesh assumes an axial shrinkage value around 7.0%. The intermediate mesh registers\nthe lowest axial shrinkage value, 5.91%, and the coarse mesh assumes a value between\nthe refined and intermediate meshes, 6.84%. In elements 11; 24 and 29, the idea of\nthe coarse mesh gives the lower accurately value and the refined mesh gives the most\naccurately value did not confirm. In elements 122; 625 and 929 from figure 9.25 (a) it\nis shown that the intermediate mesh assumes the highest axial shrinkage value. In fact,\nthe axial shrinkage behaviour, in the intermediate mesh, starts with an expansion even\nbefore the transition temperature. At the end of the sintering cycle, the intermediate\nmesh assumes an axial shrinkage value around 9.9% while the coarse and refined meshes\nassume 8.06% and 8.35%, respectively. In the elements 132; 648 and 957, for the three\ndifferent meshes, the specimen starts to expand and after starts to contract before the\ntransition temperature. The three mesh types start the contraction before the transition\ntemperature. The contraction starts to increase and the intermediate mesh registers the\nhighest value at around 14.77%. The refined and the coarse meshes register the values\nof 13.6% and 12.5%, respectively.\n\nFollowing, the relative density evolution along the sintering cycle is studied. It is\nconcluded that independently of the element number in the analysis, the behaviour of\nthe different types of meshes is very similar, more in figure 9.26 (a) and (b) than in\nfigure 9.27 (a) and (b).

Observing figure 9.28 (a), there is not any difference testing with a coarse,\nintermediate or refined mesh. For the three meshes, the sintering stress (?s) starts after\nthe transition temperature with a stress around 0.64 MPa and reaches its maximum\nat 1.1 MPa. After that, with the grain growth increasing, the sintering stress (?s)\nstarts decreasing, reaching its minimum at 0.15 MPa. In figure 9.28 (b), the sintering\nstress behaviour, in the elements 11, 24 and 29, has a similar behaviour to figure 9.28\n(a). All the three different mesh types have an identical behaviour. Three mesh types,\nthe sintering stress starts at the transition temperature with 0.41 MPa. At 1200 ?C,\nwhere the sintering stress reaches its highest value, the coarse and refined meshes reach\n1.09 MPa, while the intermediate mesh reaches 1.11 MPa. This can be perceived in\nfigure 9.28 (b), where the intermediate mesh reaches an higher value than the coarse and\nintermediate meshes. At the end of sintering cycle, the three meshes register the lowest\nsintering stress at around 0.15 MPa. Analysing figure 9.29 (a), the intermediate mesh\nstarts with a sintering stress around 0.41 MPa, while the coarse and the refined meshes\nstarts with a sintering stress of around 0.4 MPa. The sintering stress maximum value\nfor the intermediate mesh is around 1.11 MPa, while the coarse and intermediate meshes\nreach 1.07 MPa. At the transition temperature, in the cooling ramp, the intermediate\nmesh ends with a sintering stress around 0.15 MPa and the coarse and refined meshes\nend with a sintering stress around 0.14 MPa. In figure 9.29 (b), it is noticed that the\nsintering stress curve for the three different mesh types has the same behaviour of figure\n9.29 (a). For the elements 132, 648 and 957, the intermediate mesh presents the highest\nvalues. The difference in the values between the intermediate, coarse and refined mesh is\nvery low. For example, the intermediate mesh begins the sintering stress with a value of\napproximately 0.86 MPa instead of 0.84 MPa which is verified for the coarse and refined\nmeshes. At the maximum value of sintering stress, the intermediate mesh assumes a value\naround 1.16 MPa and the coarse and refined meshes assume values around 1.11 MPa.\nAt sintering stress end the intermediate mesh registers a value around 0.16 MPa instead\nthe 0.15 MPa which is verified for the coarse and intermediate meshes.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\nPart IV\n\nFinal Considerations\n\n123\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10\n\nConclusions and Future Works\n\n10.1 Conclusions\n\nIn this section, a reflection about the developed work in this document is done and after\nthat, the major conclusions retained are revealed.\n\nA powder metallurgy industrial process adapted to a finite element program was\nmodelled. Not all the steps of the powder metallurgy process were addressed. The\nconcern was in studying the two major steps in powder metallurgy: the compaction\nprocess and the sintering process.\n\nA study about soils criteria was developed to simulate the compaction process. With\nappropriate material parameters and an appropriate soil model applied (in this case\nthe Modified Drucker-Prager/cap model), it was possible to reproduce the compaction\nprocess in FEM with good accuracy. In the end of this stage, the reference parameter\nto control was the relative density, however the von Mises stress behaviour along the\ncompaction process was also studied. The relative density had an expected behaviour,\nbecause the plastic volumetric strain had a deformation around 50%, therefore the rela-\ntive density had to increase 100% in order to its initial value, and this is what actually\nhappened. Analysing the residual stress, expected values were obtained, this is, it is a\nrelatively low stress value along the specimen.\n\nIn the sintering process, it was necessary to implement a viscoelasticity model. The\nviscoelasticity model was implemented based on the Maxwell model, considering ther-\nmal deformation. This same model accounts for grain growth. Thus, the viscoelasticity\nwas implemented in a finite element code in association with grain growth model, being\npossible to predict the shrinkage in the sintering process. In this sintering process there\nwas a connection with inhomogeneous factors such as initial density distribution and the\nresidual stress resulting from die compaction. The viscoelasticity model was successfully\nimplemented in an user\u2019s subroutine, CREEP, after some validation tests. This subrou-\ntine has shown good behaviour when applied in the case study. The main parameters\nlike sintering stress, viscosity, porosity work successfully between them.\n\nSubsequentely, a sensitivity study about the different mesh types was carried out. In\nthe compaction stage, it was noticed that the influence of the refinement of the meshes\nwas not relevant, except for the punch force, where the difference was notorious. In the\nsintering stage, the axial shrinkage is the parameter in which the discrepancy between\nmeshes is more accentuated. All the other parameters that were important to study in\nsintering, it was concluded that there was not significant variance with the refinement\n\n125\n\n\n\n126 10.Conclusions and Future Works\n\nof mesh.\n\n10.2 Future Works\n\nThe main objectives that were proposed for this research were reached. The two major\nphases that describe the PM industry process were both implemented, i.e., the Drucker-\nPrager soil criteria and the viscoelasticity model were successfully implemented in a\nfinite element program.\n\nHowever this was an introductory study in the powder metallurgy processes, there-\nfore, it is necessary to continue the work in this area. Some suggestions that is registered\nare:\n\n? Testing the developed model but for other types of geometry and testing in a\ngeometry which is not axisymmetric;\n\n? Adapting this model for other types of materials, like an alumina powder, which\nis a very common material in powder metallurgy;\n\n? Testing the compaction model using another soil criteria that many researchers\nuse in the powder area, the Cam-Clay model;\n\n? Apply the porous elastic model instead of the linear elastic model;\n\n? Implement an UMAT subroutine instead of the CREEP subroutine for a stainless\nsteel and compare the results between an UMAT and a CREEP subroutine.\n\nAlexandre Manuel Ferreira Magalha?es Master Thesis\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] R Zhang.
