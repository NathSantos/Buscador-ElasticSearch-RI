In this context, adsorption by activated carbons \n\n(AC) is one of the most promising methodologies for the removal of \n\npharmaceuticals from water due to its versatility and high removal efficiency. \n\nHowever, ACs are expensive and therefore now widely applied. Primary sludge \n\nfrom paper mills has been previously appointed as a potential cheap and \n\nrenewable source of carbon for activated carbon production by pyrolysis.  \n\nComputational chemistry may help shed some light unto the molecular \n\nmechanisms underlying the adsorption of organic pollutants in ACs. In this work, \n\nit is proposed the usage of primary paper mill sludge in the production of \n\n(non)activated carbons. The different materials were characterized by a set of \n\ntechniques and the gathered data was used in the formulation of a validated \n\nmodel in an attempt to reproduce the elemental composition, functional group \n\nvariability and porosity. The developed model was used in order to collect \n\nrelevant information through molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo techniques, \n\nenabling the improvement of the initial AC material. \n\nThe obtained data in Monte Carlo simulations suggest that AC with \n\nhigher oxygen levels present greater values of surface are, and consequently \n\nsuperior maximum capacity values. The presence of positive ions in the \n\nadsorption medium presents itself as a cooperative factor for SMX adsorption, \n\ngiven the formation of AC-Na+-SMX complexes and the estabilization of open \n\nconfigurations, such as demonstrated in molecular dynamics simulations. \n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n \n \n\nIndex \n\nChapter 1: Introduction

It is the trunk and limbs that give the tree its grandeur and \n\nthe leaves themselves their meaning. There is not a discovery in science, \n\nhowever revolutionary, however sparkling with insight, that does not \n\narise out of what went before. 'If I have seen further than other men,' said \n\nIsaac Newton, 'it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants.\u201d \n\n \n\n- Isaac Asimov, Adding a Dimension: Seventeen Essays on the \n\nHistory of Science, 1964\n\n1 \nC\n\nh\na\n\np\nt\n\ne\nr\n\n \n\n\n\n2 \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n3 \n\n1.1) The prevailing issue of water contamination  \n\n______________________________________ \n\n \n\nBoth humans and animals have greatly benefited from the last century advances in \n\nmedicine. However, the consistent increase in drug production, consumption and \n\ndisregarded disposal poses severe threats to human health and non-target organisms and \n\nis a serious cause of environmental damage (1,2). This steady increase in consumption \n\nduring the last decades can be ascribed to several factors, such as the discovery of new \n\ndrugs, increase in population and industrialization levels, demographic ageing and \n\nexpiration of patents resulting in an increase of low-cost generics production (3). As an \n\nexample, China\u2019s pharmaceutical compound production has tripled from 2003 to 2011, \n\naccounting for over 20% of the total global production (4), and global consumption rates \n\nof antibiotics has increased by over 30% in the last decade (5). \n\nOver 200 pharmaceutically active compounds have been identified in the \n\nenvironment, with concentrations ranging from a few nanograms per liter to a thousand \n\nmicrograms per liter (3,6). Such pharmaceuticals, mainly antibiotics, painkillers, vascular \n\ndrugs and antidepressants (7), find their way into the ecosystem through several routes, \n\nas described in Fig. 1 (8). \n\n \n\nFig. 1. Main routes of pharmaceutical contamination of the environment. Pharmaceutical transformation \nproducts origin and propagation routes are schematically represented in red. \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n4 \n\nWastewater treatment plants (WWTP) receive contaminated effluents from drug \n\nmanufacturing plants and municipal sewage systems. After administration, \n\npharmaceuticals are metabolized and excreted by the treated organism. While human \n\nused pharmaceuticals often find their way to a WWTP, pharmaceuticals used in veterinary \n\napplications such as with domestic pets and livestock are directly delivered to the soil \n\nwhere, through infiltration, are lead to aquifers and groundwater systems. Also, \n\naquaculture derived residues are delivered directly to the water. Incorrect disposal of \n\npharmaceuticals also contributes to the contamination of aquifers, directly or through \n\nlandfill leakage, even though the major cause for environmental contamination resides on \n\nWWTP effluent discharges (9,10). It has been reported that about 64% of these emerging \n\ncontaminants are only partially removed (&lt;50%), while up to 9% are not removed at all \n\nby the standard treatment processes in WWTPs (11). \n\nFurthermore, pharmaceutical transformation products (TPs) are produced by a \n\nvariety of processes (12): \n\n? Metabolism - as an example, 26% of the administrated ibuprofen, a \n\ncommon pharmaceutical used in inflammatory diseases, pain, \n\ndysmenorrhea, or fever, is excreted in the form of hydroxy-ibuprofen, a \n\nTP generally considered more toxic to the aquatic life forms than the \n\nparent compound (5,13); \n\n? Wastewater treatment processes (such as hydrolysis, oxidation, \n\nphotodegradation, among others); \n\n? Digestion by microbial activity and other natural processes in the \n\nenvironment; \n\n? Treatment processes for surface water. \n\nSome TPs have been identified as being more ecotoxic than the parent compound, \n\nor as having synergetic and additive effects while in mixture (14). This is the case of \n\nacridine, a photodegradation product of carbamazepine (CBZ) regarded as mutagenic and \n\ncarcinogenic (15). \n\nEven though the concentration of therapeutic compounds in the water supply are \n\nbelow the minimum levels for human consumption concern in terms of an acute response, \n\nthe presence of this type of pollutants still pose a series of risks (16\u201318): \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n5 \n\n? Environmental damage to non-target organisms; \n\n? Biomagnification through the food-chain; \n\n? Long-term/sub-therapeutic exposure to both individual compounds and \n\nmixtures; \n\n? Release of antibiotics to the ecosystem acts as a selection force that can \n\nlead to the development of antibiotic resistant pathogens; \n\n? Different dose sensitivity in the young, elderly or pregnant are not studied. \n\nFor this reasons, some pharmaceutical compounds are now regarded as priority \n\nsubstances in the field of water policy according to European directives (19). Within the \n\nscope of the present work, sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and CBZ, two pharmaceutical \n\ncompounds frequently found in the environment (20\u201322), are proposed as target active \n\nagents for adsorption, whose details are expressed in Table 1 (23\u201327).  \n\n \nTable 1.

An overview of CBZ and SMX \n\nconcetrations in effluents of various WWTPs can be found in Table 2 (28\u201336). \n\n \n\nFig. 2. Sulfamethoxazole (left) and carbamazepine (right) structural changes based on pH. \nRed circles highlight the structural group who suffered deprotonation with the pH increase. \n\n \n\nSMX is an antibiotic extensively used in the control of human or animal urinary, \n\nrespiratory and gastrointestinal infections, and it is estimated that 10% to 30% is excreted \n\nby urine in the original active form (37,38). It is highly persistent to biological \n\ndegradation in common wastewater treatment processes: maximum concentrations of \n\n4.46 \u00b5g L-1 (Germany) have been measured in WWTP effluents, over double of the \n\nenvironmental quality standards (EQS) proposed by Oekotoxzentrum (2016) for chronic \n\neffects (24). In the case of SMX, bacterial resistance dissemination is a major concern, \n\nand therefore additional cautionary measures should be taken, in order to improve the \n\nremoval rate of this antibiotic from water, especially considering that some of its \n\nmetabolites are more ecologically toxic than the parent compound (39). \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n7 \n\n \n\nTable 2. Carbamazepine and Sulfamethoxazole concentrations in WWTP effluents around the world \n\n \n\nCBZ is generally applied on the treatment of seizures, neuropathic pain, and \n\nsecond-line medication of bipolar disorders and some cases of schizophrenia (40). As one \n\nof the most frequently detected pharmaceutical in wastewater (41), this compound is \n\nhighly recalcitrant to standard wastewater treatments, and poses serious risks to the \n\nenvironment and human health (42\u201344). It has been detected in WWTP effluents with \n\nmaximum concentrations as high as 6.30 \u00b5g L-1 (Germany), over triple the EQS for chronic \n\neffects (2 \u00b5g L-1) proposed (24). In previous studies, it has been shown that some \n\nphotodegradation products of CBZ (acridine and acridone) are even more toxic than the \n\nparent compound (45). \n\nFor these reasons, removal of SMX and CBZ from water without the risk of \n\ndeveloping dangerous degradation products becomes imperative. \n\nCountry \n\nWWTP effluent (ng L-1) \n\nCBZ SMX \n\nGermany &lt;6300 300 \u2013 2460 \n\nFrance 980 \u2013 1200 70 \u2013 90 \n\nBelgium &lt;1200 - \n\nItaly 300 \u2013 500 10 \u2013 30 \n\nSpain &lt;1290 - \n\nGreece 1030 90 \n\nNorway &lt;3400 - \n\nSweden &lt;1180 &lt;200 \n\nUSA 110 \u2013 190 79 \u2013 2200 \n\nJapan 18 - 86 10 - 76 \n\nUK 230 \u2013 1060 &lt;50 \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n8 \n\n1.2) Activated Carbons: a solution to \n\npharmaceutical contamination of water  \n\n______________________________________ \n\n \n\nCurrently, wastewater treatments consist mainly of two classes of methods: on one \n\nhand, conventional methods, such as flocculation, filtration and biodegradation, are \n\nmainly ineffective on the removal of persistent organic compounds. On the other hand, \n\nchlorination, oxidation by ozone and ion exchange resins are examples of advanced \n\nmethods that although having better efficiencies for the removal of pharmaceuticals, may \n\ngenerate transformation products that are even more dangerous to the environment and \n\nare generally more expensive to employ in standard WWTPs (26,46). In this context, over \n\nthe last decade, some research has been undertaken in order to quantify the efficiency of \n\npharmaceutical removal by standard and advanced water treatment processes currently \n\nemployed, as stated in Table 3. \n\n \n\nTable 3.

Although activated sludge processes can achieve significant \n\nremoval rates (79% to 100% of maximum removal), these values can vary immensely due \n\nto factors such as tank temperature, hydraulic retention time and sludge age, among \n\nothers. This unpredictability of results can pose a liability. Furthermore, the optimization \n\nof such factors for removal of therapeutic compounds may lead to lower removal rates of \n\nother contaminants, such as pathogenic microbial agents, and therefore priority \n\nguidelines should not be overridden (17). \n\nAdvanced wastewater treatments such as membrane filtration or ozonation allow \n\nhigher removal rates of pharmaceuticals from wastewater (99% and 96% of maximum \n\nremoval efficiency, respectively), but require an intensive capital investment when \n\ncompared to standard practices, and therefore are not employed to a meaningful extent. \n\nUV treatments, as well as photolysis and ozonation can produce TPs and should be applied \n\nwith caution. Moreover, ultraviolet radiation presents a fluctuating range of removal rates \n\n(1-100%), and can be, therefore, unreliable in industrial scale applications (17,50). \n\nIn this context, adsorption of contaminants by activated carbons (AC) emerges as \n\nan optimistic solution, with advantages such as versatile usage and high removal \n\nefficiencies and the ability to regenerate and reuse spent adsorbents (51), even though it is \n\nstill not widely used because of its high-cost (52) and the fact that it doesn\u2019t mineralize \n\nthe contaminants (49). Current estimations place the world\u2019s demand for AC around 1.1 \n\nmillion tons per year, and it is expected to grow at a rate of over 10% per year until at least \n\nthe 2020\u2019s (53). AC are carbon-rich materials with a porous structure, that can be activated \n\nby thermal/physical and/or chemical processes in order to increase internal superficial \n\narea and therefore, adsorption capacity (54). AC applications vary, including adsorption \n\nof industrial pollutants, heavy metals, organic and inorganic compounds, microorganisms, \n\nas well as energy storage (55). \n\nRegarding AC production processes, Fig. 3 schematizes two routes to achieve \n\ncarbonization and activation of precursor materials. Through physical processes, the \n\nstarting material is firstly carbonized, and then suffers activation under an oxidizing gas \n\nflow such as water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), or a mixture of both, at high \n\ntemperatures (800 to 1100 \u00baC) (56,57), whereas in common chemical activation there is \n\ncarbonization and activation of the initial material simultaneously when impregnated \n\nwith activating chemical agents at medium-high temperatures (400 \u2013 900 \u00baC) (55,57,58). \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n10 \n\nThe most common activating agents are zinc chlorine (ZnCl2), di-hydrogen phosphate \n\n(H2PO4-), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and potassium \n\ncarbonate (K2CO3). Chemical activation has shown some benefits over physical processes, \n\nsuch as higher yields, inferior pyrolysis temperatures, and the fact that it generally \n\nproduces AC with highly developed micro porosity, higher surface area (600 to 2000 m2 \n\ng-1) and reduced mineral matter content (20). However, chemical activation is commonly \n\nmore expensive, deals with corrosive substances and requires an extra washing step (59). \n\nAlthough a considerable number of different attributes need to be analyzed in order to \n\nfully characterize an AC, the specific surface area (SBET) and average pore diameter (D) are \n\nsome of the significant influential factors and the most commonly found attributes \n\ndescribed in the available literature (21). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 3. Standard activated carbon production methods. The proposed method for the present work is \nillustrated in red. \n\n \n\nWashing is often required in order to remove impurities originated by the chemical \n\nactivation process, usually with water or an acid chemical agent such as hydrochloric acid \n\n(HCl) (60). Carbonization using high-power microwaves (1200 W) instead of nitrogen \n\n(N2) purged muffles has been discussed, with proposed advantages such as shorter \n\nprocess times, lower energy demands and higher yields (53). \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n11 \n\nOn the subject of activation agent selection, K2CO3 emerges as a promising \n\nchoice, based on its environmental advantages, such as avoiding eutrophication problems \n\nassociated with phosphate use (61) and not being corrosive of hazardous as some \n\nalkalimetal hydroxides (62). Also, in previous studies, K2CO3 activation resulted in AC \n\nwith high specific surface areas. For instance, by using industrial pre-treated cork, a SBET \n\nof 907 m2 g-1 was achieved (63), when testing AC production from sisal waste a SBET of \n\n1038 m2 g-1 was obtained (64), cornstalk lignin based AC showed a SBET of 1410 m\n2 g-1 \n\n(61) and when using chitosan as feedstock, AC showed a SBET of 2130 m\n2 g-1, although \n\nwith a larger percentage of mesopores (65). Although the activation method is not \n\nthoroughly studied, it is believed that activating agents containing potassium improve the \n\nmicroporous nature of the feedstock material by intercalation of the metal with the \n\ncarbonaceous structure and acting as a cast during pyrolysis (62,66,67). \n\nCommercially available AC are commonly produced from fossil fuels such as \n\npetroleum or bituminous coal and mainly distributed in two forms: powdered activated \n\ncarbons (PAC) and granular activated carbons (GAC), illustrated in Fig. 4. Both were \n\nshown to have consistent removal rates of over 90% for more than 25 types of \n\npharmaceutical agents. Usually, PAC is continuously fed into the treatment reactors as a \n\nnew product, while GAC can be regularly regenerated (68). Some other unusual forms of \n\ndistribution include fibers, cloths, nanotubes or pellets (55). Since AC removal from the \n\nreaction medium after adsorption can be troublesome, studies using magnetized AC for \n\nmagnetic removal were carried, showing promising results (69). \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 4. Main forms of activated carbons distribution: powdered (left) and granular (right) \n\n \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n12 \n\nRegarding pharmaceuticals adsorption, AC efficiency greatly depends on the \n\ntarget molecule chemistry, given that adsorption is generally governed by \n\nhydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, non-covalent attractions (?-? stacking) and \n\nelectrostatic attraction/repulsion based on the surface functional groups of the carbon. It \n\nwas previously reported that PAC DETOX 1600, a commercially available AC, presented \n\nremoval rates of 92%, 76% and 73% towards Triclosan, Metoprolol and Trimethoprim, \n\nwhile only removing 9%, 3% and 1% of Acetaminophen, Caffeine and Ibuprofen, where \n\nthe authors point electrostatic interactions, chemical bounding and other non-specific \n\nforced as the main agents in the adsorption process. This lower removal rates were \n\nimproved by combining AC adsorption with ultrafiltration, reaching removal rates of over \n\n90% towards all pharmaceutical compounds (70).  \n\n Given the presence of functional groups on the AC surface, previous works \n\ndemonstrated the influence of pH on removal rates of pharmaceuticals and regeneration \n\ncapacity of AC. Results regarding the adsorption of pramipexole dihydrochloride (PD), a \n\npopaminergic antiparkinsonism agent, and dorzolamide (D), an ophthalmic glaucoma \n\nagent, using AC derived from potato peels, showed that adsorption was favored by lower \n\npH (around 2), (61% maximum removal rate of PD and 55% removal rate of D), while \n\nregeneration of the used AC was favored by higher pH (around 10). (71). A different \n\nstudy showed similar results, where the adsorption of ceftazidime was favored at low pH. \n\nThis effect was attenuated by the impregnation of the AC with metals such as iron, \n\naluminum and copper (4). In opposition, alanine adsorption by commercially available \n\nAC was shown to be favored by basic pH (above 8) and low content of oxygen (72), \n\nrevealing that the protuberant adsorption mechanism is dependent on the target molecule \n\nchemistry. \n\n Therefore, two main characteristics in the adsorbent are of importance: the \n\nsuperficial area/pore development and surface chemistry (26). \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n13 \n\n1.3) Harnessing the potential of paper mill primary \n\nsludge as feedstock for activated carbon production  \n\n______________________________________ \n\n \n\nCurrently, AC are primarily derived from fossil fuels hydrocarbons resulting from \n\nthe heavy fractions of petroleum and coal or expensive lignocellulosic materials, so its use \n\nis therefore restricted by cost and availability, as well as environmental concerns regarding \n\nparticulate matter generation or heavy metal contamination during carbonization \n\nprocesses, as well as extensive exploration of natural resources (51,56,57). As summarized \n\nin Table 4, abounding alternative renewable sources of cellulosic precursors have been \n\nproposed and studied as alternative precursors for AC production, either by physical \n\nactivation (PA) or chemical activation (CA). \n\nTable 4.

IUPAC recommendations define a micropore as being a \n\npore with a diameter of less than 2 nm (80). \n\nBesides agricultural precursors, some industrial wastes have been studied as \n\npotential feedstock for AC production. Primary paper mill sludge (PS) is the result of \n\nprimary treatment of paper mill effluents, as described in Fig. 5. This material mainly \n\nconsists of wood fibers and organic matter such as amino acids, polycyclic aromatic \n\nhydrocarbons, heterocyclic compounds and organofluoride compounds (81,82).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 5. Schematic representation of primary sludge origin in paper mill effluent treatment processes, \nhighlighted in red \n\n \n\nPulp and paper mills around the globe produce large amounts of PS: USA, Japan, \n\nChina, Europe and South Africa together produce nearly 30 million tons per year (83). \n\nFor comparison, in North America, 4 kg of sludge is produced for every 100 kg of paper \n\n(84). Furthermore, disposal of PS is currently a major issue. Traditionally, it involves \n\nlandfilling or energy production though incineration/combustion. However, such \n\nsolutions are rapidly becoming unsustainable based on a number of factors (81,82,84):  \n\n? Water removal from crude PS in order to meet landfill standards, as well as \n\ntransportation to the landfill, is economically suboptimal; \n\n? Leachate production in landfills constitutes a ground water pollution source; \n\n? Progressively stringent measures have been employed regarding landfill space \n\ndepletion; \n\n? Given the high water content of untreated PS, energy production is far from \n\nideal due to energy loss to water evaporation; \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n15 \n\n? Combustion of PS, if improperly handled, may cause atmospheric pollution \n\ndue to NOX, SOX and suspension dust emissions; \n\nGiven its abundance and sizable content in carbon, PS has been proposed as a \n\nfeedstock for AC production (26,46,85\u201389), after showing interesting results for the \n\nproduction of non-activated carbons, and therefore acting as a starting point for the study \n\nof AC production. When compared to commercial ACs, alternative adsorbents generated \n\nfrom PS showed faster adsorption kinetics, comparable SBET and higher adsorption \n\ncapacity, especially when considering samples activated with ZnCl2. Another study using \n\nPS as a starting point for AC production showed that further biological activation with \n\nPseudomonas putida resulted in an increase from 65% removal rate of phenol to 97% (90). \n\nThese results further substantiate the notion that AC generated from PS material is a \n\nversatile and competitive option to common AC. \n\n  \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n16 \n\n1.4) Computational chemistry as a powerful tool  to \n\nunderstand adsorption mechanisms  \n\n______________________________________ \n\n \n\nDespite being thoroughly studied, the adsorption process at the molecular level in \n\nAC remains shrouded and constitutes a point of divergence in the scientific community. \n\nFor example, disparity in theories regarding the primary adsorption principle exists, where \n\nsome studies point functional group interactions as the main force guiding molecular \n\nadsorption, while others assign it to microporous structure and specific surface areas (77). \n\nTherefore, deeper insights into the interactions between adsorbates and the AC are \n\nnecessary. This would allow the modulation of the AC characteristics in order to increase \n\nadsorption capacities and rates or target compound selectivity. \n\nComputational chemistry harnesses the power of generalized and readily available \n\ncomputers use to simulate dynamic aspects of molecular systems (91) by molecular \n\ndynamics (MD) and/or Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Citing Tamar Schlick (92): \n\n\u201cMD is the science of simulating motion of a system of particles according to \n\nNewton\u2019s classical equations of motion.\u201d \n\nIn other words, MD allows the study of molecules movement in detail, bridging \n\nmolecule structure to function. Besides molecular dynamics techniques, MC approaches \n\nbecame a standard practice in adsorption simulations (93). Grand Canonical Monte Carlo \n\n(GCMC) is highlighted among the several ensembles proposed. In this technique, the \n\nchemical potential, volume and temperature of the system are fixed, leaving the \n\npressure/concentration of the species involved as the sole parameter contributing for the \n\naddition/deletion of molecules in the system (94). This ensemble allows for an easy \n\ndefinition of adsorption isotherms and helps to highlight competition effects, such as co-\n\nadsorption (95).  \n\nSeveral models for AC have been previously proposed as schematically shown in \n\nFig. 6. Structureless models use a continuous surface without isolated atoms (96). Slit pore \n\nmodels assumes an array of semi-infinite and rigid carbon walls at a given distance (pore \n\nsize) (96). They are often decorated with functional groups to study their influence in a \n\nsimple manner. Both approaches try to simplify the carbon material surface and often fail \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n17 \n\nto account for more complex situations, such as pore architecture or edge effects. Mimetic \n\nmodels try to imitate the synthesis process, through techniques such as Reverse Monte \n\nCarlo, template mesoporous structures or quenching (94). This results in more complex \n\nmodels that more closely mimic the structure of real ACs, but often lack experimental \n\ncharacteristics and uniqueness between different instances of the same model, and are \n\ncomputationally expensive to generate (97). Finally, we have the reconstruction models: \n\nthese models often use data from experimental characterization techniques to build the \n\nmodel of the AC. A common approach is the usage of microcrystallites: graphitic \n\nstructures with less than 5 nm in diameter, comprised of stacked carbon layers and based \n\non experimental observations, as to create a virtual porous carbon (VPC) models. The \n\nspatial orientation and stacking of this building blocks in 3D space creates pores that give \n\nthe VPC\u2019s their characteristic high surface area (98).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 6. Activated carbon model examples. The proposed model type for the present work is highlighted in red. \n\n \n\nThe VPC reconstruction method has been explored in previous works, since the \n\nfirst proposed model by Segarra and Glandt in 1994 (99). For this reason, the VPC models \n\nare sometimes referred to as SG models. Platelets with an homogeneous size and nature \n\nwere used, without explicit atoms described, in a very simple fashion. Several authors \n\nupgraded this initial model in order to define more complex behaviors. Some works of \n\ninterested are highlighted below. \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n18 \n\nLiu et al. (100) explored the usage of the VPC reconstruction method in order to \n\nstudy the adsorption of water in AC\u2019s, using GCMC. The results show that the created \n\nmodel is in accordance to experimental data in terms of isotherm shape, further validating \n\nthe VPC model. \n\nDi Biase et al. (101) used simple fullerene-like molecules packed in a simulation \n\nbox, where the density was tuned in order to achieve the desired surface area of the \n\nresulting material. Some platelets were further adorned with hydroxyl (-OH) or carboxyl \n\n(-COOH) to study the effect of oxygen concentration and nature. GCMC was then \n\nemployed to develop adsorption isotherms of CH4 and CO2 in gaseous phase. The results \n\nshow good agreement with experimental data. Oxygen groups in the carbon surface \n\nincreased CO2 adsorbance, with the nature of the oxygen groups not being relevant. \n\nGonciaruk et al. (102) followed a similar strategy, but introduced the use of \n\ndifferent types of platelets, with varying sizes. However, the resulting AC model surface \n\narea was not explicitly defined, and resulted from natural microcrystallite packaging. This \n\npackaging resulted in a porous structure with surface areas between 175 and 500 m2 g-1. \n\nAlthough these values are lower than expected, the proposed model was not optimized \n\nbased on any experimental data. GCMC was then used to study CO2 and CH4 adsorption, \n\nwith appropriate similarity to experimental results. \n\nMore recently, Bahamon et al. (95) further explored the usage of VPC models, with \n\nthe addition of more complex molecules as targets for adsorption (ibuprofen, in this \n\nexample, is one of the few studies performed with organic contaminants). The used AC \n\nmodel included different sized platelets, defects and oxygenated groups (hydroxyl, pyran, \n\ncarboxyl and carbonyl). Finally, ibuprofen adsorption from an ibuprofen/water mixture \n\nwas simulated using GCMC. Results are in general accordance with experimental results \n\navailable in literature, since the defined model was not optimized in accordance to any \n\nspecific AC sample in a quantitative manner, being a pure qualitative behavior study.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction \n\n19 \n\n1.5) Present work objectives  \n\n______________________________________ \n\n \n\nThe possibility to adapt the existing computational models in a quantitative \n\nmanner to a real sample of AC naturally emerges as an interesting development in the field \n\nof AC modelling and as a tool for designing improvements in AC production. Such study \n\nwould allow the modulation of the characteristics of AC to improve adsorption rate, \n\ncapacity or selectivity towards certain target molecules. This objective requires substantial \n\ncharacterization of real AC sample in terms of surface area, elemental constitution, charge, \n\nparticle size and functional group composition. Characterization of the feedstock and \n\ncarbon materials of intermediary steps allow a broader overview of the process. \n\nAs previously stated, paper mill PS showed promising results when used as \n\nfeedstock for AC production, making it a compelling candidate for the present study. The \n\napplication of AC in water treatment has showed consistency on obtaining good results \n\nwhen it comes to pharmaceutical adsorption from contaminated water systems, therefore \n\nCBZ and SMX emerge as interesting adsorption targets. However, questions regarding \n\nwhich properties constitute an efficient adsorbent persist. Therefore, an assortment of \n\ncomputational chemistry strategies is proposed to elucidate molecular behaviors \n\notherwise inaccessible, such as molecular dynamics simulations and GCMC adsorption \n\nstudies. The development of a unified model which can accurately replicate experimental \n\ndata is hereby proposed as a step towards a better understanding of the chemistry \n\nunderlying pharmaceutical adsorption by AC, as schematically represented in Fig. 7. \n\n \n\nFig. 7. Proposed work map \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n20 \n\n \n\nHence, the objectives of this work are as follows: \n\n? To produce real AC using paper mill PS as feedstock, by chemical activation using \n\nK2CO3 and HCl washing. \n\n? To fully characterize the AC structure and surface chemistry using a battery of \n\ntechniques to obtain a set of relevant data: \n\no Point of Zero Charge (PZC); \n\no Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR); \n\no Transmission (TEM) and Surface (SEM) Electron Microscopy; \n\no Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS); \n\no Total Organic carbon determination (TOC);  \n\no Proximate and ultimate analysis; \n\no Specific Surface Area (SBET); \n\no X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). \n\n?

The sludge was obtained from a Portuguese factory operating an \n\nelemental chlorine free kraft process, using Eucalyptus Globulus. PS was dried at 60 \u00baC in \n\nan oven, for 24h and grinded with a blade mill before further treatment. A description of \n\neach sample treatment can be found in Table 5. \n\nACs were produced by chemical activation with potassium carbonate (K2CO3), in \n\na proportion of 1:1 (w/w). The activating agent solution was prepared with the proportion \n\nof 50 mL of distilled water (H2Od) to 15g of K2CO3. PS was impregnated during 1h in \n\nultrasounds bath at room temperature. The impregnated PS was left to dry for 7 days on \n\nthe hotte.  \n\nPyrolysis of PS or impregnated-PS was performed in porcelain crucibles. The \n\npyrolysis was performed in a furnace muffle under inert atmosphere with a nitrogen flow, \n\nat 800\u00baC, heating rate of 10 \u00baC min-1 and residence time of 150 minutes. Nitrogen flow was \n\nmaintained during the cooling of the furnace. Samples without further treatment were \n\ngrinded with a blade mill, and named PS800. \n\nSome samples were subjected to a washing step using HCl in a proportion of 1.2 g \n\nof carbon material to 40 mL of 1.2 M HCl (37%, Panreac). The carbon material and the \n\nwashing solution were kept in contact for 1h. The resulting slurry was vacuum filtered and \n\nwashed with distilled water until neutral pH of the washing leachate was achieved. The \n\nsamples were then dried for 7h in an oven at 105 \u00baC, and subsequently grinded with a blade \n\nmill. Such samples were named PS800-HCl and PS800-K2CO3-HCl, the latter having \n\nsuffered chemical activation. \n\nTable 5.

A total of 11 tubes were used from pH \n\nvalues ranging from 2 to 12. Initial pH values were measured and adjusted using 0.1 M and \n\n0.05 M HCl (37%, Panreac), and 0.1 M and 0.05 M NaOH (99.3%, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Gomes dos \n\nSantos, Portugal). The final pH was measured and the PZC was determined by plotting the \n\n?pH (pHf \u2013 pHi) versus the pHi. The PZC is the pH value at which the curve intersects the \n\nx-axis. All carbon samples were subjected to this technique, except PS. \n\n \n\n2.2.2) Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total \n\nreflectance (FTIR-ATR) \n\nFTIR-ATR spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu-IRaffinity-1 spectroscope, with \n\nnitrogen purge. The measurements were recorded in the range of 600-4000 cm-1, 4.0 of \n\nresolution, 128 scans and with atmosphere and background correction. All carbon \n\nsamples, including PS, were subjected to this FTIR-ATR analysis. \n\n \n\n2.2.3) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) \n\nTEM images were obtained using a HR-(EF)TEM JEOL 2200FS microscope at the \n\nfollowing magnitudes: 5 000x, 20 000x, 50 000x, 80 000x, 100 000x, 150 000x and 200 \n\n000x. All carbon samples were subjected to TEM imaging, except PS. Higher magnitudes \n\nof 150 000x and 200 000x were only applied in PS800-K2CO3-HCl samples. \n\n \n\n2.2.4) Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray \n\nspectroscopy (EDS) \n\nSEM images were obtained at the following magnitudes: 300x, 1 000x, 3 000x, 10 \n\n000x, 30 000x and 50 000x, using a Hitachi SU-70. The apparatus was also used to \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and methods \n\n25 \n\nperform EDS analysis using a Bruker QUANTAX 400. All carbon samples were subjected \n\nSEM imaging and EDS, including PS. \n\n \n\n2.2.5) Total organic carbon (TOC) content \n\nTotal carbon (TC) and inorganic carbon (IC) were determined using a TOC-VCPH \n\nShimadzu analyzer, with a solid sample module SSM-5000A, and the TOC content was \n\nobtained by difference. Glucose (C6H12O6, 40% of carbon) was used as standard to \n\nestablish and test the calibration curve for TC determination, while sodium carbonate \n\n(Na2CO3, 11% of carbon) was used as the standard for IC determination. Carbon content of \n\nthe materials was determined as the average of 3 replicates. All samples, including PS, were \n\nsubjected to TOC content determination. \n\n \n\n2.2.6) Proximate and ultimate analysis \n\nStandard methods to determine the moisture (UNE 32002), volatile matter (UNE \n\n32019) and ash content (UNE 32004) were employed in a LECO TGA-601 automatic \n\nanalyzer, for proximate analysis. The remaining fraction after ash and volatile matter (at \n\ndry basis) was determined to be the fixed carbon content. \n\nUltimate analysis were performed in a LECO CHNS-932 analyzer, determining the \n\ncontent in carbon (C), hydrogen (H), nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) in the samples. The \n\ndifference between the remaining fraction, in dry basis, and the ash percentage was \n\nconsidered to be the oxygen (O) content.  \n\nAll carbon samples, including PS, were subjected to proximate and ultimate \n\nanalysis. \n\n \n\n2.2.7) Specific surface area (SBET) \n\nSpecific surface area (SBET) was determined on a Micromeritics ASAP2420 \n\napparatus using the N2 adsorption isotherm at -196\u00baC and Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller \n\nequation in the relative pressure range 0.01\u20130.1. Degasification process of the sample was \n\ncarried overnight. Additionally, average pore width and total pore volume were also \n\ndetermined from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure of 0.99. All carbon \n\nsamples were subjected to SBET determination, except PS. \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n26 \n\n \n\n2.2.8) X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) \n\nFunctional group content was determined by XPS analysis. Spectra were acquired \n\nin an Ultra High Vacuum system with a base pressure of 2x10-10 mbar located on TEMA, \n\nUniversity of Aveiro. The system is equipped with a hemispherical electron energy \n\nanalyzer (SPECS Phoibos 150), a delay-line detector and a monochromatic AlK? (1486.74 \n\neV) X-ray source. High resolution spectra were recorded at normal emission take-off angle \n\nand with a pass-energy of 20 eV, which provides an overall instrumental peak broadening \n\nof 0.5 eV. Only PS800-K2CO3-HCl sample was targeted for XPS analysis. \n\n  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and methods \n\n27 \n\n2.3) Computational modelling approaches \n\n______________________________________ \n\n2.3.1) Carbon model development \n\nCarbon models were obtained by clustering carbon microcrystallites into a VPC. \n\nThe carbon material was considered to be a disordered configuration of platelets of \n\ndifferent sizes, decorated with specific functional groups, as an extension of the Segarra \n\nand Glandt model (103), and more recently, the Bahamon approach (95). Experimental \n\ndata was considered in order to mimic the real material characteristics, namely the AC \n\nsurface area, elemental constitution and functional content, having PS800-K2CO3-HCl as \n\na starting point. The applied strategy and resulting AC models are further discussed in \n\ndetail in chapter 3. \n\nA great deal of attention was given to automation throughout the present work. A \n\nseries of Python scripts were developed in order to produce the AC model in a reliable and \n\nautonomous way, so that replicas could be easily studied. An online repository version of \n\nthe developed and used scripts during this work can be found at \n\ngithub.com/JosePereiraUA/carbon/. In this context, the following tasks were programmed \n\nin the produced scripts: \n\n? Carbon residue design, with the following options: \n\no Size and number of carbon layers; \n\no Functionalization content, where the following functional groups were \n\ndesigned: ethers, carbonyls, carboxyls and edge hydrogens; \n\no Atom charges determination; \n\no Functional group hydrogenation in accordance to pH; \n\n? Residue library construction, with variable number of residues; \n\n? Clustering process of residues into AC models, with the following options: \n\no Atom count limits; \n\no Charged ions addition; \n\n? Manipulation of necessary files for both batch MD studies and GCMC essays \n\nhttps://www.github.com/JosePereiraUA/carbon/\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n28 \n\nAtomtypes for all molecules used in the present work, including the carbon \n\nmodels, were extracted from Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF) forcefield (104), and \n\nsimplified for this model application. For this matter, non-bonded interactions were \n\nconsidered to be Lennard-Jones pairs, with Lorentz-Berthelot combination rules as \n\ndefined in GAFF forcefield. Lennard-Jones and electrostatics 1-4 interactions were \n\nmultiplied by a 0.5 and 0.833 factor, respectively. \n\nFor functional group\u2019 partial charge definition, small sets of carbon rings were \n\nmanually designed using Avogadro 1.1.1 (105), and the different types of functional groups \n\nwere added separately. The resulting molecules were optimized by Density Functional \n\nTheory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level using Gaussian09 (106). The minimized structure \n\nwas then used in the calculation of the electrostatic potential map, at the HF/6-31G* level, \n\nfrom which Restrained Electrostatic Potential (RESP) partial charges were obtained using \n\nAntechamber (107). \n\nThe obtained partial charges were used in the developed Python script. A \n\nfunctional group was considered as all the heteroatoms involved, the carbon atom where \n\nthe functional group is attached to (C0) and the neighbor carbon atom connected to C0. \n\nAll functional groups had a neutral charge: positive charges were dispersed by C0 and \n\nneighbor atoms to keep the sum neutral.  \n\n\n\nChapter 2: Materials and methods \n\n29 \n\n2.3.2) Pharmaceutical molecules parametrization \n\nCBZ and SMX molecules were manually designed on a first approach, using \n\nAvogadro 1.1.1, and relaxed using GAFF forcefield and Steepest Descent Algorithm.  \n\nThe resulting molecules were subject to a multi conformational analysis as follows: \n\nthe molecules were firstly brought up to 1500K in a molecular dynamics simulation in \n\nvacuum (translation/rotation around the system center of mass was removed), allowing \n\nthem to rearrange in conformations with associated energies distinct from the global \n\nminimum energy value. Snapshots were gathered every 1 ps, for 2.5 ns, resulting in 2500 \n\ndifferent conformations gathered. Each of the resulting frames was minimized, and the \n\nresulting conformations were sorted based on the structure energy, where the 20 \n\nmolecules with the lowest energies were selected for superimposed visualization. As \n\nillustrated in Fig. 8, all the resulting conformations were similar. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 8. Multi conformational analysis results (20 conformations aligned): Left \u2013 CBZ shows a rotation center; \nRight \u2013 SMX present rotation to some extent on the CH3 group, but adopts a closed conformation on itself \n\n \n\nThe conformation with the lowest energy was then further optimized by DFT at \n\nthe B3LYP/6-31G* level, using Gaussian09 software. The eletrostatic potential map was \n\ncalculated at the HF/6-31G* level, and partial charges for the pharmaceutical molecules \n\nwere obtained using RESP method on Antechamber. \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n30 \n\n2.3.3) Molecular dynamics simulations \n\nMolecular dynamics simulations were performed using the GROMACS software \n\n(108), in 125 nm3 cubic boxes (5 nm each side) with periodic boundary conditions (PBC) \n\napplied. All simulation stages used: the Verlet \n\ncut-off scheme for neighbor searching; \n\nparticle-mesh Ewald for electrostatics beyond \n\n12 \u00c5 cut-off; 12 \u00c5 cut-off for van der Waals \n\ninteractions. Water molecules were modeled \n\naccording to the TIP3P model (109). \n\nFirstly, pharmaceutical molecules of \n\ninterest were attempted to be introduced in \n\nthe system until the requested number was \n\nplaced or no more available space was \n\nidentified (100 insertion trials per molecule). \n\nSecondly, solvent molecules were added until \n\nno more space was free, as described in Fig. 8. \n\nMolecular dynamics simulations were split \n\ninto 5 different stages: \n\n? Solvent relaxation: Position restrictions \n\nwere imposed to carbon and pharmaceutical \n\nmolecules, in order for the water molecules to \n\nadopt a more natural position. Minimization \n\ncriteria were: Fmax &lt;10 kJ mol\n-1 nm-1, 100 000 \n\nsteps or ?F lower than machine tolerance; \n\n? Minimization: The whole system was \n\nenergy minimized without restrictions, following \n\nthe previous criteria; \n\n? Heat equilibration: The simulation was \n\nbrought up to 300K, for 1 to 2 ns, using a Nose-\n\nHoover extended ensemble, and maintained stable \n\ntowards the end of the stage; \n\n? Pressure equilibration: The simulation \n\nbox vectors were compressed by a Parrinello-\n\nRahman extended-ensemble to equilibrate the \n\nsystem at 1 bar pressure, during 1 to 2 ns. \n\nFig. 9.

Data gathering: The equilibrated system settings was kept for 10 ns for data \n\ncollection, having snapshots collected every 20 ps for further analysis. Linear \n\nConstrain Solver (LINCS) algorithm was employed to convert all bonds and \n\nangles that involve hydrogen atoms to bond constrains. \n\n \n\n2.3.4) Monte Carlo adsorption essays \n\nMonte Carlo adsorption essays were carried out in the GCMC ensemble using \n\nRASPA 2.0 software (110). Partial pressure values were converted to fugacity using the \n\nPeng-Robinson equation of state (111), as stated in Eq. 1.  \n\n \n\n? =  \n??\n\n?? ? ?\n?\n\n??\n\n??\n2 + 2??? ? ?\n\n2\n , ?????: \n\n? =\n0.45724 ?2??\n\n2\n\n??\n \n\n? =\n0.07780 ? ??\n\n??\n \n\n? = ( 1 + ?

SMX and CBZ critical properties \n\nwere estimated using Joback method (112), and acentric factors were predicted using \n\nPositional Distributive Contribution method (113). The calculated values used in the \n\npresent work are available in Table 6. GCMC essays were performed for 3000 to 6000 \n\nsteps (or until equilibrium), at 300K and 1 atm. Water was used as solvent in all essays. \n\nPartial pressures of the components in the simulation were tuned to reflect the desired \n\nconcentration of the pharmaceutical molecules in the mixture. \n\n \n\nTable 6.

Two modes of adsorption were studied: single component and competitive \n\nadsorption. In competitive adsorption, the considered pharmaceuticals were in an \n\nequimolar mixture. Four types of moves were employed, with equal probability, in the \n\nGCMC ensemble: translation, rotation, reinsertion and identity change. Translation and \n\nrotation move and orient the molecule in 3D space; reinsertion moves try to remove or \n\ninsert a new molecule in the simulation box with equal probability.; identity change moves \n\ntry to remove one molecule and insert a different one in the same place and with the same \n\norientation. This move was especially useful in competitive adsorption essays. \n\n \n\n2.3.5) Monte Carlo surface area determination \n\nGeometric surface area of the modelled materials was computed using Monte \n\nCarlo, where a probe atom (radius ? = 2.958 \u00c5) was \u201crolled\u201d over the AC model surface, \n\nand the SBET was considered as the summation of all non-overlapping probe spheres after \n\n104 steps. Additionally, void fraction volumes were also computed using MC. Helium \n\nprobes were inserted in the AC model box using Widom particle insertions, and the void \n\nfraction was determined to be the empty space divided by the total volume. \n\n \n\n2.3.6) Visualization methods \n\nMolecular structures were visualized with PyMol (114). Carbon atoms are displayed \n\nin dark grey, oxygen atoms in red, hydrogen atoms in light grey, nitrogen atoms in blue \n\nand sulphur atoms in yellow. In pharmaceutical molecules, SMX carbon atoms are \n\ndisplayed in light brown and CBZ carbon atoms are displayed in dark green, for clarity. \n\nMacromolecular electrostatic potential maps were obtained with the Adaptive \n\nPossion-Boltzman Solver (APBS) plugin for PyMol (115). APBS writes out electrostatic \n\npotentials in dimensionless units of kb T ec-1 where kb is Boltzmann\u2019s constant (1.38 x 10-23 \n\nJ K-1), T is the temperature (K) and ec is the charge of an electron (1.6 x 10-19 C). \n\nPore studies were performed with the aid of MOLE 2.0 software (110), considering \n\nonly pores with diameters less than 2nm (micropores). A 30 \u00c5 surface probe was used to \n\nfind cavities. \n\n \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResults and discussion \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u201cNo, you're not going to be able to understand it. \u2026 That is because I \n\ndon't understand it.

As \n\nillustrated in Fig. 10, production yields were vastly different among samples: PS800 had a \n\nproduction yield of 43.2%. When the carbon material suffered a washing step with HCl, \n\nthe production yield plummeted to 15.1%. This difference can be attributed to the removal \n\nof inorganic material and also inevitable losses of carbon. Furthermore, when the carbon \n\nmaterial was activated using K2CO3, the overall yield of the production step was 3.5%, as \n\na result of the reaction between the percursor and the activating agent which resulted in \n\nan extremely low-density material.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 10.

Fig. 11 \n\nshows the FTIR-ATR spectra obtained for each of the samples characterized. It is possible \n\nto distinguish a fingerprint region on the spectra, around wavenumber 500 to 1700 cm-1. \n\nSeveral peaks can be identified, namely: \n\n? The small set of peaks from 500-750 cm-1 are usually acknowledged as \n\nsignals from in- and out-of-plane vibrations from aromatic ring \n\ndeformations, while the 1650 cm-1 peak can be attributed to C=C stretching \n\nin benzene rings; \n\n? The peaks at 1030, 1110 and 1160 cm-1 are recognized as C-O-C stretching \n\nvibrations signals; \n\n? The peak around 1350 cm-1 can be related to C-H bending vibrations; \n\n? The broad peak at 1440 cm-1, in conjugation with a sharp strong signal at \n\n875 cm-1 is characteristic of carbonate ions; \n\n? Although with smaller intensity, the broad peak at 3300 cm-1, in \n\nconjugation with smaller peaks at 2920 and 3640 cm-1 indicates the \n\npresence of -OH alcohol or phenol groups; \n\nThe identified peaks fade in PS800-K2CO3-HCl sample. Such information can give \n\nus a first indication of the surface chemistry of the characterized samples. The gathered \n\ndata suggests that PS-derived carbon material\u2019s functional groups are primarily composed \n\nof ethers, phenols, alcohol and C-H groups. It is still possible to observe the disappearance \n\nof FTIR-ATR signals related to carbonate ions in materials subjected to HCl washing, in \n\nPS800-HCl and PS800-K2CO3-HCl samples, being expected that formed pores and \n\ncavities become unobstructed by these carbonate impurities, increasing the carbon \n\nmaterial effectiveness in adsorption experiments. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n37 \n\n \n\nFig. 11. FTIR-ATR spectra of the precursor and different carbon materials \n\n \n\n3.2.2) Point of zero charge (PZC) determination \n\nFor the PZC determination, tubes with a salt solution, at different pH values \n\nbetween 2 and 12 (pHi), were incubated with a carbon material sample. It is expected that \n\nthe carbon functional groups interact with the medium to provide or receive protons, \n\ncontributing for a variation in the final pH (pHf) of the sample. For this reason, the PZC is \n\ndefined as the pH value at which the pH of the medium is similar to the one on the carbon \n\nsurface, and therefore there is an insignificant change in pHf. In Fig. 12, this is shown as \n\nthe pH value at which the ?pH is 0. PZC values of the studied samples are as follow: \n\n? PS800: 11-12 \n\n? PS800-HCl: 7-8 \n\n? PS800-K2CO3-HCl: 5-6 \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n38 \n\n \n\nSuch values pose more of a qualitative \n\nassessment than a quantitative one. Their \n\nrelevance relies on the notion that, with further \n\ntreatment, the resulting carbon material becomes \n\nmore acidic. This can be explained by the removal \n\nof carbonates from the feedstock by HCl washing, \n\nfurther enhanced by the increase in porosity and \n\ndisorder after chemical activation. \n\nFurthermore, it is possible to observe an \n\napparent buffering capacity to minimum and \n\nmaximum pH values (close to 2 and 12). This \n\neffect can be interpreted as an artifact caused by \n\nthe presence of very strong acidic and alkaline \n\nsolutions, since the salt solution pH was adjusted \n\nwith HCl and sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Small \n\ncontributions from the carbon functional groups \n\nwould then pose little to no disturbance towards \n\npHf. For this reason, only at pHi close to neutral is \n\npossible to determine the PZC. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.3) Transmission electron m icros copy (TEM)  \n\nTEM images provide an effective way of visually observing the internal morphology \n\nof the carbon materials, namely the carbon sheets that compose them, as illustrated in Fig. \n\n13. For lower amplifications, it is possible to observe the lack of crystalline organization of \n\nthe samples. In particular, non-activated carbons show a prevalence of amorphous \n\nmaterials, while PS800-K2CO3-HCl samples present a much higher degree of pore and \n\ncavity formation. \n\nFig. 12.

Comparing this with PS800, it is possible to infer that \n\npyrolysis removed much of the volatile carbon matter, reducing the relative abundance of \n\nthe carbon element in comparison to others. Carbonates removal by HCl washing is also \n\nsupported by these data, showing the reduction of Ca peak relative intensity in PS800-\n\nHCl sample. Finally, the PS800-K2CO3-HCl EDS spectra show that the activation step is \n\nmostly responsible for increasing the amount of carbon on the surface, therefore reducing \n\nthe relative intensity of the other elements peaks. \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2.5) Total organic carbon (TOC) content \n\nRegarding TOC content, the performed analysis suggests that pyrolysis is \n\nresponsible for the removal of most inorganic carbon (IC), reducing its prevalence \n\nfrom 13.2 \u00b1 0.2 % of the total carbon in PS to only 0.12 \u00b1 0.04 % of the total carbon \n\nin PS800-K2CO3-HCl. \n\nThe data, illustrated in Fig. 16, also \n\ncomplements previous observations \n\nrespecting the total content in carbon, \n\nby comparing the carbon percentage in \n\nPS800 and PS800-HCl. It\u2019s possible to \n\ninfer that the washing step is responsible for \n\nremoving most of the IC in the carbon \n\nmaterial, increasing the relative percentage \n\nof total carbon in the sample from 23.2 \u00b1 0.2 \n\n% to 58.8 \u00b1 0.2 %. The activation step also \n\nresults in an increase in carbon percentage, to \n\n66.9 \u00b1 0.6 %. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 16. Organic (OC) and IC content in PS and the \nproduced carbon materials \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n43 \n\n2.3.6) Proximate and ultimate analysis \n\nThermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PS and the produced carbon materials \n\nprovided relevant insights regarding volatile matter, moisture and mineral \n\ncontent, as illustrated in Fig. 17. Moisture percentage in the precursor was \n\ndetermined to be 4.9%, while decreasing to 2.5% after pyrolysis, as expected. With \n\nfurther treatment, moisture levels increased to 7.7% and 16.6% in PS800-HCl and \n\nPS800-K2CO3-HCl, respectively. This increase may be caused by an increase in \n\nporosity and therefore surface area and adsorption potential of moisture. \n\nAt a dry basis, it is possible to observe a relevant decrease in volatile matter \n\nafter pyrolysis, from 63.9% to 21.2%. Pyrolysis also resulted in an increase in ash \n\ncontents, from 28.0% to 61.7%, while not significantly improving the levels of fixed \n\ncarbon. HCl washing was effective in reducing the ash levels from 61.7% to 23.42%, \n\nbeing this value even lower after activation, 10.75%. This resulted in a relative \n\nincrease of fixed carbon, reaching 57.2% and 63.3% in PS800-HCl and PS800-\n\nK2CO3-HCl, respectively. In a general way, fixed carbon and volatile matter \n\ncontents in each sample follow similar values when compared to TOC analysis \n\ndata. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 17. Thermogravimetric analysis results, displayed in dry basis \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n44 \n\nUltimate analysis was also employed to quantify elemental content for carbon (C), \n\nhydrogen (H), sulfur (S), nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O), as described in Fig. 18. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 18. Elemental analysis of PS and produced carbon materials, in dry and ash free basis, for mass and \namount of substance percentages (Oxygen content was determined by difference) \n\n \n\nGathered data agrees with previous characterization techniques, showing the \n\nprevalence of mostly carbon, oxygen and hydrogen in the samples. It is possible to infer \n\nthat volatile matter released during pyrolysis is mostly constituted by oxygen and \n\nhydrogen. With a relatively high percentage of oxygen (24.3% in n), PS800-K2CO3-HCl \n\nraises questions regarding the importance of the existence of heteroatoms in adsorption \n\nprocesses. Finally, it is considered that sulphur and nitrogen appear in only trace \n\npercentages on the activated carbon (0.032\u00b10.01% and 0.62\u00b10.04% in n, respectively), \n\nand therefore have a limited contribution in modulating adsorption processes. \n\n \n\n2.3.7) Specific surface area (SBET) \n\nAs stated in Table 7, several textural parameters were obtained for each of the \n\nproduced carbon materials. It is possible to observe the activating effect of potassium \n\ncarbonate on the carbon material, increasing the SBET from 248 m2 g-1 to 1586 m2 g-1. This \n\nvalue places the produced activated carbon in the present work on pair with available \n\ncommercial products. By comparison, the commercially available AC PULSORB has a SBET \n\nof 1109 m2 g -1 (87) and the PAC DETOX 1600 has a SBET of 1550-1600 m2 g -1 (70). \n\nFurthermore, chemical activation also had a profound repercussion on micropore content. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n45 \n\nIt is possible to infer that micropores have a much higher incidence on the \n\nactivated sample, contributing in a larger scale for the increase of total pore volume (VP). \n\nAccording to IUPAC (80), micropores are defined as having a pore diameter of less than 2 \n\nnm. This places the average pore on PS800-K2CO3-HCl sample on the threshold of \n\nmicroporosity, with an average size of 2.93 nm. \n\n \n\nTable 7.

The proposed fitting of \n\nthe experimental data is shown in Fig. 19, \n\nand a schematic model for the considered \n\nfunctional groups is illustrated in Fig. 20. \n\nBeing a surface characterization technique \n\nwith a depth of analysis up to 10 nm, it \n\nallows us to have an unprecedented look \n\ninto the surface chemistry of the activated \n\ncarbon. From the C 1s spectra it is possible \n\nto verify that most of the carbon layers are \n\ncomposed of sp2 carbon, with some \n\nfunctionalization level of -CH (8.5%), ethers \n\n(15.9%), carboxylic (2.9%) and carbonyl \n\n(8.4%) groups. These results are in \n\naccordance with FTIR data, and the O 1s \n\nspectra. Other effects such as ?-? transition \n\nand plasmon bands were considered to \n\nbetter fit the tail of the C 1s spectra, and \n\nadsorbed water in the O 1s spectra, who \n\nfollow the same order in abundancy. \n\nAlthough in trace quantities, N-based \n\nfunctional groups were possible to be \n\nquantified: mostly pyridonic (37.3%) and \n\npyridinic groups (36.2%).  \n\n \n\nFig. 19.

This \n\nabstraction requires, nonetheless, a certain level of approximation and assumptions in the \n\ninterest of obtaining pertinent data in a reasonable time window. In the next section the \n\ndevelopment of the activated carbon model will be further explored. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n48 \n\n3.2) Carbon model development \n\n______________________________________ \n\n \n\n2.3.1) Residue library assembly \n\nAs referred in section 2, AC models were obtained by clustering carbon \n\nmicrocrystallites into a VPC. The carbon material was considered to be a disordered \n\nconfiguration of platelets of different sizes, decorated with specific functional groups, as \n\nan extension of the Segarra and Glandt model (103), and more recently, the Bahamon \n\napproach (95). Only experimental data relative to PS800-K2CO3-HCl was considered for \n\nthe assembly of the AC model. \n\nSeveral residue libraries were produced through a collection of Python scripts \n\ndeveloped for this purpose. The proposed libraries are composed of microcrystallites of \n\ndifferent sizes and thickness: as a starting point, an average length and width of 20 \u00c5, and \n\n1 to 4 parallel graphite-like layers with 3.14 \u00c5 gap were considered, as described by Rosalind \n\nE. Franklin (116). These values were intended to be tuned in order to mimic real \n\ncharacteristics of the AC in the VPC model, but, interestingly, such default values resulted \n\nin models having good accordance with the desired characteristics, namely the surface \n\narea. \n\nThe microcrystallite layers were then enhanced with different functional groups to \n\nreflect the experimental characterization of the real AC. The considered functional groups \n\nwere: carboxyls, carbonyls, C-H terminations, 2-ring and 3 ring-ether crowns and ether \n\nterminations. Carboxyl protonation was performed in accordance with the pH of the \n\ndesired simulation, having a negative charge for pH values below the modeled carbon PZC, \n\nand vice-versa. All the simulations were performed at pH 7. Since the AC sample PZC is \n\naround 5, all carboxyls were, consequently, deprotonated and bearing a negative charge. \n\nEdge carbons were often left without hydrogen atoms attached to keep aromaticity after \n\ncarboxyl and carbonyl groups were added. An example residue is represented in Fig. 21. \n\nBasic groups were ignored in this particular model, given their low presence in the \n\nexperimental sample. \n\nA random Gaussian distribution was employed in the input experimental values to \n\ngenerate small variances in the different residues of each library, in an effort to better \n\nreproduce the real heterogeneity of the carbon materials. Therefore, all values obtained \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n49 \n\nare the median of several slightly different models. Each library was composed of at least \n\n100 different residue microcrystallites.  \n\n \n\nFig. 21. Non-minimized residue example from one of the created libraries.

A random number of residues was arbitrarily placed \n\ninside a cubic simulation box with a volume of 125 nm2 and the carbon atom count limit \n\nwas placed at 3000 atoms per simulation, in order to keep the complexity of the system \n\nand the clustering time as low as possible, without compromising the relevance of the \n\nobtained results. The maximum number of insertion attempts of new residues tuned to \n\nensure that all available space was occupied, and the void fraction of the box was only \n\nmodulated by the size of the residues. The system was then left to minimize through \n\nmolecular dynamics simulation in vacuum. Simulations were performed in the NVT \n\nensemble (no pressure coupling); translation/rotation around the system center of mass \n\nwere removed in all simulations. The proposed residue clustering process, illustrated in \n\nFig. 23, was composed of 3 distinct stages: \n\n? Minimization: The system was initially relaxed. Minimization criteria were: Fmax \n\n&lt;10 kJ mol-1 nm-1, 100 000 steps or ?F lower than machine tolerance; \n\n? Heating: The system was brought up to 300K, allowing the molecules to adopt \n\nhigher energy conformations and cluster together during 1 to 2 ns.  \n\n? Stabilization: The carbon model were left to stabilize at 300K for 1 to 2 ns, for \n\ndata gathering (every 1000 steps) and pore development. The LINCS algorithm \n\nwas applied to convert all bonds and angles that involve hydrogen atoms to bond \n\nconstrains.  \n\n \n\nFig. 23.

A visual depiction of each model after the clustering \n\nprocess is displayed in Fig. 24. It is possible to verify that, with the increase in oxygen \n\nlevels, the resulting microcrystallites progressively diverge from the initial planar form, \n\nand take a rougher structural shape, because the majority of the functional groups added \n\nduring functionalization imply sp3 hybridization, therefore promoting loss of aromaticity \n\nof the carbon backbone and planarity of the microcrystallites. \n\nm\nin\n\nO\nx\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nfu\nll\n\nO\nx\n \n\n  \n \n\nm\na\nx\nO\n\nx\n \n\n  \n \n\nFig. 24.

Further information regarding the characterization of the VPC models can be \n\nfound in Table 8. The increase in oxygen \n\ncontent augments the surface area of the \n\ncorresponding AC model. Considering that \n\nthe original experimental AC has a surface \n\narea of 1586 m2 g-1, the VPC model could \n\nstill be optimized regarding this property \n\n(2043 \u00b1 200 m2 g-1). This lack of \n\naccordance between the real AC and the \n\nproposed model can be explained by: \n\n? The residual existence of impurities, mainly carbonates, in the real sample \n\nwhich block access to smaller pores, thus reducing the SBET. \n\n? The existence of enclosed cavities in the AC, inaccessible to the probe \n\nmolecule in experimental SBET determination, but accounted for in the \n\nMonte Carlo method, described in section 2. \n\nIn terms of elemental and functional content composition, it is considered that the \n\nproposed model is in good accordance with the experimental data, as shown in Fig. 26. \n\nFurthermore, modulation of the oxygen content between model samples was achieved to \n\nthe desired extent. However, -C-H content differs between PS800-K2CO3-HCl and fullOx \n\nmodel. On the model, crown ethers and edge ethers in equal amount. The existence of \n\nedge ethers limits the appearance of -C-H groups on the AC model. Therefore, it is \n\nexpected that in PS800-K2CO3-HCl ethers appear mostly in internal ethers. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 26.

Delaunay triangulation/Voronoi diagrams were used \n\nin order to search for the shortest path between a starting point and the molecular surface \n\n(110). Pore structure has been appointed as an important factor in different applications, \n\nsuch as adsorption (117\u2013119). Therefore, the proposed model in the present work should be \n\nable to develop an organized and viable micropore structure. Such challenge, although not \n\ntrivial, is considered to be accomplished in the proposed AC models developed, as shown \n\nin Fig. 27. Both fullOx and maxOx models showed good pore development, but no \n\nmicropores were displayed in minOx models. \n\n \n\nFig. 27. Micropore structures in the proposed models: Top \u2013 fullOx; Bottom \u2013 maxOx; The corresponding \nstructure in displayed in the right without the surrounding AC atoms, for visualization purposes. \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n55 \n\n2.3.4) Dipole moment visualization \n\nIn order to understand certain behaviors to be discussed in the following topics, a \n\nvisual representation of the involved molecules electrostatic potential maps emerges as a \n\npowerful tool. APBS was employed in the calculation of SMX and CBZ electrostatic \n\npotential maps, as illustrated in Fig. 28. It is possible to visualize that SMX has a stronger \n\npotential gradient than CBZ, as expected due to the negative charge.  \n\n \n\n+5  -30 \n\nFig. 28. Electrostatic potential maps (in kbT/e): Left \u2013 CBZ; Right \u2013 SMX. Atom partial charges are \nalso displayed for visualization purposes. \n\n  \n\nFurthermore, a trajectory configuration result of competitive adsorption was also \n\ntargeted in order to create the electrostatic potential of the involved species in equilibrium, \n\nas shown in Fig. 29. Negative electrostatic potentials are mainly caused by the presence of \n\ncarboxyl groups and are often preferred sites for both SMX and CBZ adsorption. \n\n \n\n+5  -30 \n\nFig. 29. Electrostatic potential map (in kbT/e) of the resulting AC model from MD simulation \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n56 \n\n2.3.4) GCMC essays \n\nGCMC ensemble simulations were employed to perform adsorption essays of CBZ \n\nand SMX onto the produced models. The present study targets two factors as modulators \n\nof adsorption: oxygen content and ionic strength on the wastewater. Several replicas for \n\neach residue library were produced, as previously described. 3 replica runs were performed \n\nfor each carbon model, additionally, in order to evaluate both the inter- and intra-model \n\nvariations. Maximum adsorption capacities were calculated for each library model \n\n(minOx, fullOx and maxOx), as described in Fig. 30. For each AC model, two modes of \n\nadsorption were considered: single component (SC \u2013 Only 1 pharmaceutical at a time) and \n\ncompetitive adsorption (C \u2013 Both SMX and CBZ were added to the simulation \n\nsimultaneously). This allows for the study of possible competitive or cooperative \n\nmechanics in the adsorption of this pharmaceuticals. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 30. GCMC adsorption results for different AC models, regarding CBZ and SMX in single component \n(SC) and competitive (C) modes \n\n \n\nIn a general way results suggest that pharmaceutical adsorption increases with \n\nincreasing oxygen content (? 20x and 6x increase for CBZ and SMX, respectively, in SC \n\nmode, from minOx to maxOx models). Competitive adsorption, overall, showed lower \n\nadsorption values for each pharmaceutical, as expected, but not in a meaningful manner \n\nor within the errors of the SC mode essay. This suggests the existence of some degree of \n\ncooperative adsorption or double layer effects, where a second pharmaceutical molecule \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n57 \n\nis adsorbed to the surface of a first already adsorbed to the carbon surface. Finally, it is \n\npossible to observe a clear distinction between the adsorption of the two pharmaceuticals. \n\nFor the maxOx model, CBZ had an adsorption capacity ca. 2x superior to SMX. \n\nSince the simulations were carried at neutral pH of 7, both SMX and the AC are negatively \n\ncharged and repulse each other. This does not apply to CBZ, which is neutral at pH 7.  \n\nAs previously discussed, an increase in oxygen content of the AC models resulted \n\nin an equal increase in the surface area which, consequently, has positive repercussions in \n\nadsorption capacities. With this in mind, and analyzing Fig. 31, it is possible to infer that \n\nthe increased SMX adsorption by carbons with oxygen content (and, therefore, charge) is \n\ncaused by the increase in the AC surface area, while an increase in oxygen content has an \n\nadditional positive effect in CBZ adsorption. Although being a neutral species at pH 7, CBZ \n\ncan have induced dipole moments (as discussed in the section above concerning the \n\nelectrostatic potential maps) that interact with negatively charged functional groups of \n\nthe AC. This result hints at the importance of functional groups and electrostatic \n\ninteractions as modulators of adsorption and/or specificity in AC adsorbents. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 31. Adsorption capacity and surface area evolution with the absolute value of charge (e-1) )in the AC \nmodel, for CBZ and SMX. Dashed lines represent the linear regression of that available data. \n\n \n\nThe effect of ionic strength on pharmaceutical adsorption was previously \n\nappointed as an important factor to take into account (120). In a real sample, ions ought \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n58 \n\nto be naturally solvated in bulk water and away from the carbon surface, especially if the \n\nion charge was equal to the dominant charge in the carbon surface Therefore, no ions were \n\nintroduced in this simulation boxes. However, if a high enough ionic strength was \n\nintroduced, by concentration increase, there would be a higher incidence of ions in the \n\nAC surface, and its influence in surface chemistry events, such as adsorption, should be \n\nconsidered. Sodium (Na+) was introduced in GCMC adsorption essays, in equimolar \n\nconcentrations as the considered pharmaceuticals, and the results are exposed in Fig. 32. \n\nAs expected, adsorption capacities increase with the increase in oxygen content. However, \n\nwhen Na+ ions are added, both pharmaceuticals adsorption capacities in the AC increase \n\n(for maxOx model, an ? 1.25x and 5x increase is observed for CBZ and SMX adsorption, \n\nrespectively, when compared to equivalent simulations with no ions added). SMX \n\nadsorption is predominantly affected. Two main mechanisms can be proposed: \n\n? Na+ ions screen the negative charge of both the AC and SMX, bridging the \n\ntwo species and allowing adsorption to the functional groups. This effect \n\nwould allow for SMX to be predominantly adsorbed in the oxygen rich \n\nregions of the microcrystallites edges; \n\n? Na+ ions change the conformation of SMX to a more stable configuration, \n\neventually promoting adsorption by weaker interactions (?-? stacking). \n\nAlthough \u201csalting out\u201d effects are a possible explanation to the experimental \n\nobservations described in literature (121), such effect was not considered in this work. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 32. GCMC adsorption results for different AC models, regarding CBZ and SMX in single component (SC) \nand competitive (C) modes, when in presence of Na+ ions \n\n\n\nChapter 3: Results and discussion \n\n59 \n\nAlso, inspection of Fig. 33 suggests that, with a higher ionic strength, the previous \n\nbehavior, in which SMX adsorption was fundamentally modulated by the increase in \n\nsurface area, is no longer observed. In the presence of Na+, it is possible to infer that \n\noxygen-rich functional groups have a positive effect on adsorption capacities of SMX \n\nbesides the increase in surface area, while CBZ adsorption is not improved beyond the \n\nincrease resulting from surface area expansion. \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 33. Adsorption capacity and surface area evolution with the absolute value of charge (e-1) in the AC \nmodel, for CBZ and SMX in the presence of Na+. Dashed lines represent the linear regression on the available \n\ndata points. \n\n \n\n \n\n2.3.5) Molecular dynamics \n\nMolecular dynamics simulations were carried out to highlight some of the \n\nproposed adsorption behaviors. Simulations were carried for 10 ns after minimization and \n\nequilibration. The presented behaviors were established relatively early (1 to 2 ns into the \n\nsimulation) and remained stable. As an example, after adsorption on the carbon surface, \n\nno pharmaceutical molecule was desorbed. The following behaviors are transversal to all \n\nsimulations performed and present in multiple replicas. \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n60 \n\n? Double layer adsorption \n\nAs shown in Fig. 34, four molecules of \n\nCBZ are tightly packed in a confined pore. The \n\nCBZ structure and neutral charge allows for the \n\nformation of double layers of adsorption, \n\neffectively increasing its adsorption capacities \n\nin normal circumstances, as previously \n\nhighlighted in GCMC adsorption essays. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n? SMX configurations \n\nAlthough multi conformation analysis showed that, in vacuum, SMX adopts a \n\nsingle \u201cclosed\u201d conformation, MD studies showed that this molecule can adopt an \u201copen\u201d \n\nconformation that is stabilized on the surface of the AC upon adsorption, as illustrated in \n\nFig. 35. Interestingly, when performing MD simulations with no Na+ ions, 20% of the \n\nadsorbed SMX adopted the open structure, while simulations with Na+ in solution showed \n\nthat 40% of the SMX was in this configuration. Such results indicate that counter-ions \n\nbalance the repulsive forces between the negatively charged groups in the pharmaceutical \n\nand AC, allowing the prevalence of ?-? stacking and hydrophobic interactions.  \n\n \n\nFig. 35. Different configurations of SMX on a single microcrystallite, at different visualization angles \n\nFig. 34. Adsorbed CBZ in fullOx model.

Na+ complex with SMX \n\nAs illustrated in Fig. 36-Left, Na+ ions interact with both the SMX and AC negative \n\ncharged groups, screening the electrostatic repulsion and allowing for the establishment \n\nof ?-? stacking and hydrophobicity interactions. This effect allows SMX to be adsorbed \n\nonto the oxygen rich microcrystallites edges, as illustrated in Fig. 36-Right.  \n\n \n\nFig. 36. Na+ and SMX complexes with AC charged groups: Left \u2013 Na+ interaction allows the prevalence of \n\u201copen\u201d configurations; Right \u2013 Na+ allows for the interaction with microcrystallite\u2019s edges \n\n \n\n? Competition effects \n\nCompetitive interactions were \n\nobserved between CBZ and SMX in MD \n\nsimulations, although not with great \n\nfrequency, as illustrated in Fig. 37. Only 10 to \n\n20% of the pharmaceutical molecules were in \n\ninteraction with the one another. This \n\nindicates that, if present, cooperative \n\nadsorption mechanics are not relevant for this \n\ntwo specific pharmaceutical in a meaningful \n\nextent. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFig. 37.

The fact that we live at the bottom of a deep gravity well, on the \n\nsurface of a gas covered planet going around a nuclear fireball 90 million \n\nmiles away and think this to be normal is obviously some indication of \n\nhow skewed our perspective tends to be, but we have done various things \n\nover intellectual history to slowly correct some of our misapprehensions.\u201d \n\n \n\n- Douglas Adams, The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One \n\nLast Time, 2002\n\n4 \nC\n\nh\na\n\np\nt\n\ne\nr\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n\n\n\nChapter 4: Conclusion \n \n\n65 \n\nTo conclude the present study, an overall appreciation of the performed studies is \n\npresented, and some points are enumerated relative to possible future work in this subject. \n\nThe present project was essentially divided in three parts: experimental data \n\ngathering, AC model development and simulation results collection using the produced \n\nmodels. The primary objective was to produce a VPC model that would follow \n\nexperimental data in a more accurate fashion in terms of elemental composition, \n\nfunctional group content, surface area and porous structure.  \n\nIn terms of the first part of the present work, a total of 10 different techniques were \n\nexplored to grant a thorough comprehension of the complexity of the carbon materials \n\nworked. Besides AC, non-activated materials were also produced and characterized to help \n\nunderstand the evolution of the adsorbent. Experimental data was used in the formulation \n\nof the AC model:  \n\n? PCZ was used to define the AC charge at the simulated pH; \n\n? FTIR and XPS data information regarding the functional group content; \n\n?  EDS and Ultimate analysis data concerning elemental composition; \n\n? SBET studies define the AC surface area; \n\n?  TEM and SEM imaging help to elucidate the pore structure. \n\n Complementary techniques, such as Proximate analysis and TOC help in clarifying \n\nthe composition of the AC samples in terms of fixed carbon, carbonaceous impurities and \n\nother aspects not covered in the computational model approximation. \n\nThus, AC model development had an experimental basis on top of which more \n\naccurate VPC models were built. It is shown that elemental composition, functional group \n\ncontent, surface area and pore structure are in good accordance to the gathered \n\nexperimental data. This constitutes a validated computational model of the AC sample. \n\nSuch a model constitutes a workhorse for easily running simulations with the aim \n\nof gathering hints and evidence about the underlying mechanisms of adsorption of \n\npharmaceuticals of interest from aqueous solutions. In the present work, CBZ and SMX \n\nwere studied in more depth. MC and MD simulations were carried out, having the initial \n\nmodel tuned to reflect new conditions in the adsorption environment or changes in the \n\nmaterial composition. It was demonstrated that surface area increases with oxygen \n\n\n\nComputational optimization of bio adsorbents for the removal of \npharmaceuticals from water \n\n66 \n\ncontent, inducing higher adsorption capacities. This effect is further enhanced for neutral \n\nsubstances such as CBZ. Also, when a high ionic strength is imposed to the system (in the \n\nform of addition of Na+ ions), adsorption is greatly intensified. This effect is augmented in \n\nthe adsorption of negatively charged molecules such as SMX. MD simulations reveal the \n\nformation of AC-Na+-SMX complexes, in double layer and in microcrystallites edges, and \n\nshowing good stability over time, reinforcing pharmaceutical adsorption and, therefore, \n\nconstituting a possible modulating factor in SMX specific adsorption. \n\nAlthough all simulations were carried at pH 7, the AC model scripts, \n\npharmaceutical definitions and simplified force fields were prepared with the notion of \n\nuser-defined pH. Therefore, pH effects on adsorption can be easily discussed and explored \n\nusing the developed framework and made freely available to the scientific community. \n\nFurthermore, besides altering the total oxygen content of the AC model, the option to \n\nkeep the oxygen composition while simply altering the functional group content was also \n\nimplemented, and the study of the differences between the majority of functional groups \n\ncan be readily explored. These two circumstances are appointed as possible future work \n\nregarding this specific AC. In terms of computational modelling, new pharmaceuticals of \n\ninterest should also be explored.  \n\nIn the experimental part of this project, and based on the information gathered, it \n\nis possible that increasing the oxygen content on the samples (in the form of \n\nfunctionalization) may result in higher adsorption capacities and surface areas, as \n\nsuggested by the modelling results. In addition, experimentation with higher ionic \n\nstrength media can be interesting as a way to modulate adsorption of certain species of \n\npharmaceuticals.  \n\nIn short, the present work required some approximations that, in future works, one \n\nshould try to minimize or avoid, in order to increase the reliability of the gathered results, \n\nsuch as the fact that fugacity coefficients in GCMC simulations were extrapolated by \n\napproximation methods and, given time constrains, the number of replicas produced in \n\nGCMC essays was lower than desired. \n\nHowever, given the scope of the project, it is considered that the conclusions \n\ngathered are reliable and of interest, and that the initially proposed objective was \n\naccomplished. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n67 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLiterature \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\u201cScience and literature are not two things, but two sides of one \n\nthing.\u201d \n\n \n\n- Thomas Henry Huxley, Aphorisms and Reflections from the Works \n\nof T.H.
