After taking into \n\nconsideration different possible value added products and production routes, the aim of this project \n\nwas defined as simulate and design a production process of polymer grade ethylene and propylene \n\nfrom natural gas via methanol-to-olefins route. The overall process consists of three steps: natural \n\ngas reforming, methanol synthesis and olefins production. The first step is contracted out, while \n\nthe other two steps occur on-site. Synthesis gas from natural gas reforming reacts over \n\nCu-ZnO-Al2O3-12.5% CNTs catalyst under 428 \u00baF and 725 psia to produce methanol with 64% \n\nconversion and approximately 100% selectivity. Then, methanol reacts over H-SAPO-34 catalysts \n\nunder 710 \u00baF and 23.9 psia to produce olefins, leading to 98% conversion and a combined \n\nselectivity of ethylene and propylene of 80%. Production rate of 1.6 million lbs/day of propylene \n\nand 1.1 million lbs/day of ethylene are found to be achievable. The economic feasibility of the \n\ndesign is evaluated and has a total capital investment of $ 343 million. The minimum selling prices \n\nof ethylene and propylene are calculated to be $ 0.56/lb and $ 0.52/lb, respectively, which undercut \n\ncurrent market prices, $ 0.65/lb of ethylene and $ 0.61/lb of propylene. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Ethylene, propylene, natural gas, feasibility study. \n\n  \n\n\n\niv \n \n\nRESUMO \n\n \n\nQuantidades consider\u00e1veis de g\u00e1s natural foram recentemente encontradas nas regi\u00f5es norte \n\ne oeste da Pensilv\u00e2nia, aumentndo os incentivos econ\u00f4micos, sociais e pol\u00edticos para manter este \n\ng\u00e1s natural nos Estados Unidos, bem como encontrar alternativas para seu uso que n\u00e3o somente a \n\nsua queima para gera\u00e7\u00e3o de energia.

This is especially relevant \n\nin the northern and western area of Pennsylvania, where regions with substantial gas quantities \n\nhave been found [1]. This new abundance of natural gas has raised economic, social and political \n\nincentives to keep this natural gas within the United States boundaries and find alternative uses \n\nbesides combustion for energy production only. \n\nThe economic incentive is that the technology exists to convert natural gas into chemical \n\nproducts worth more than the value of the energy obtained from the gas. The profitability of these \n\nprocesses is increasing due to recent groundbreaking technologies, such as the discovery of \n\nefficient catalysts and processes to treat natural gas [2]. The social incentive is that, using natural \n\ngas as a feedstock to replace oil derived feedstock, the amount of toxins released into the \n\nenvironment would be reduced. Natural gas processing does not release dangerous byproducts such \n\nas benzene, coke or hydrogen fluoride unlike the oil refining processes do. The communities \n\nlocated near these potential new sites would not have to worry about dangerous chemicals released \n\nin the air. The political incentives to retain the natural gas locally and find new ways of processing \n\nit are based on the desire to rejuvenate the stagnant manufacturing industry in the United States, \n\nmore specifically in Pennsylvania, as well as the willingness of the current political administration \n\nto financially support developing new manufacturing technologies [3]. Therefore, promising \n\nsuccess in the field of natural gas conversion technologies could be eligible for government \n\nfunding.   \n\nGiven these incentives to look for alternative technologies to process natural gas, this report \n\nwill determine the feasibility of producing a value-added product from natural gas. More \n\nspecifically, in this report the following questions will be addressed:  \n\nx What value-added product is to be produced from natural gas and what chemical \n\nscheme should be used to obtain it? \n\nx Is the proposed process technically and economically feasible to obtain the selected \n\nproduct from natural gas? \n\n\n\n15 \n \n\nAdditionally, considerations in this report will include the determination of an input/output \n\nstructure, as well as a recycle and separation structures to achieve the desired purities for the \n\nintermediates and final products of the proposed process.  \n\nThe remaining content of this report is organized as follows. First, the background provides \n\njustification for the chosen product as well for the chemical scheme to obtain it from natural gas. \n\nThe main body sections, the conceptual and final designs, and the NPV analysis provide the \n\ndescription and economic assessment of the proposed process design. Finally, in the conclusions \n\nsection, the key findings to the overall investigation are provided, according to the goals outlined \n\nabove.  \n\n\n\n16 \n \n\n2 BACKGROUND \n \n\nBefore a final design to produce a value added product from natural gas is implemented, \n\nbase technical information needs to be obtained. Information is gathered and decisions are made in \n\nregard to three main areas:  \n\nx Choice of product based on a market analysis \n\nx Choice of chemical production route based on analysis of available options \n\nx Technical information about the selected reaction pathway \n\n2.1 Market Analysis \n \n\nBefore a value added product from shale gas is chosen, several possible options are \n\nexamined. Some of the potential choices include: \n\nx Propanol  \n\nx Isopropanol \n\nx Butanol?  \n\nx Acetone \n\nx Propylene glycol \n\nx Polyhydroxyalkanoate \n\nx Propylene \n\nTable 2.1 shows the approximated annual global demand for each of these chemicals. \n\nTable 2.1 - Global market demand for potential produced chemicals. \n\nChemical Global market demand \n(billion lbs/year) \n\nPropanol [4] 0.31 \nIsopropanol [5] 4.90 \nButanol [6] 10.00 \nAcetone [7] 12.00 \nPropylene glycol [8] 3.50 \nPolyhydroxyalkanoate [9] 0.02 \nPropylene [10] 192.00 \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n \n\nFrom this list of seven possible chemicals, propylene is chosen as the product to move \n\nforward with. The major benefit of propylene is the high global demand. Propylene\u2019s global market \n\nsize is 192 billion lbs/year and demand is expected to increase to over 286 billion lbs/year in the \n\nnext decade [10]. The huge current demand for propylene, along the expected growth of the market, \n\nallows us to open a large-scale plant without saturating the market and driving down prices to an \n\nunprofitable level. An additional benefit of the propylene market is the wide range of end products. \n\nThis protects us against the possibility that a market shrinks because there are so many other \n\nmarkets to make up for lost demand. End products of propylene derivatives include, but are not \n\nlimited to [11]: \n\nx Automotive plastics \n\nx Injection molded plastics- bottle caps, toys, etc. \n\nx Films and labels \n\nx Fibers- carpets, clothing, rope \n\nx Foams \n\n \n\n2.2 Chemical Route \n \n\nAfter the selection of a product, three possible chemical routes are assessed before one final \n\nroute is selected. The three potential routes are oxidative coupling of methane, methanol to olefins, \n\nand monohalogenation.  \n\n \n\n2.2.1 Route 1 \u2013 Oxidative Coupling \n \n\nThe first route for the transformation of methane to propylene is an oxidative coupling of \n\nmethane to ethylene using a solid Ca/Sr nanowire catalyst. This reaction proceeds by the following \n\nstoichiometry:  \n\n2CH4 + O2 ? C2H4 + 2H2O \n\nThis step has a methane conversion of 6% and ethylene selectivity of 40%. Additional \n\nmethane then reacts with the ethylene to form propylene [12]. \n\n\n\n18 \n \n\nC2H4 + CH4 ? C3H6 + H2 \n\nMethane and ethylene react over catalyst SAPO-34, yielding a maximum conversion of \n\n71.2% and propylene selectivity of 73.3% at 840 \u00b0F [13].  \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Route 2 \u2013 Methanol to Olefins (MTO) \n \n\nThe second viable route is the methanol to olefin (MTO) process. This reaction converts \n\nmethane to synthesis gas (syngas), which is converted to methanol and finally propylene. Since the \n\noverall objective of this project is to design a new value-added chemical production process, the \n\nwell kwon syngas production process, the steam reforming, is decided to be contracted out to an \n\noutside company. \n\nIn the next step, methanol is produced from syngas according to the following \n\nstoichiometry.  \n\nCO + 2H2 ? CH3OH \n\nCO2 + 3H2 ? CH3OH + H2O \n\nThis reaction takes place using a mixture of copper zinc oxide, and alumina as a catalyst. \n\nEven though carbon dioxide is indispensable for the conversion of the syngas, its conversion is \n\nquite low [14]. For this reason, the conversion of carbon dioxide will be considered zero. At the \n\noptimal conditions of 428 \u00baF and 725 psia, carbon monoxide can achieve conversion up to 64% \n\nand a selectivity of approximately 100% [14]. \n\nThe third step is the methanol to olefins (MTO) process. This process reacts methanol over \n\nzeolite catalyst called H-SAPO-34 to produce mostly olefins and water. The reaction can be \n\nperformed under high temperature and low pressures to enhance the production of light olefins. \n\nThe conversion takes place through a complex network of chemical reaction not fully understood \n\nso far, so stoichiometry and kinetic modelling are not well defined yet. The highest yield of \n\npropylene occurs at 710 \u00baF and 23.9 psia. At these operational conditions, the conversion of \n\nmethanol is 98% and the percent yields of propylene, ethylene, butylene, butane, and dimethyl \n\nether are 46.5%, 33.5%, 8.5%, 9.5% and 2% in mass respectively [15].  \n\n \n\n\n\n19 \n \n\n2.2.3 Route 3 \u2013 Monohalogenation  \n \n\nThe final potential chemical route is a two-step mechanism that converts methane to \n\npropylene via monobromomethane.  \n\n2CH4 + 2HBr + O2 ? 2CH3Br + 2H2O \n\n3CH3Br ? C3H6 + 3HBr \n\nThe first step uses a CeO2 catalyst and occurs at 1040 \u00baF. These conditions lead to a 16% \n\nconversion and 74% selectivity to methyl bromide. The second step is performed at 751 \u00baF with \n\nZSM-5 as a catalyst. The conversion of this step is 95% and the selectivity is 56% to propylene \n\n[16].  \n\n \n\n2.2.4 Route Selection \n \n\nTables 2.2 and 2.3 compare the conversions and selectivities of the 3 different routes being \n\nconsidered. \n\nTable 2.2 - Comparison of conversions to propylene for each route. \n\nStep Route 1 [12] [13] Route 2 [14][15] Route 3 [16] \n\n1 6.0% Contracted Out 16.0% \n\n2 71.2% 64.0% 95.0% \n\n3 - 98.0% - \n\nOVERALL 4.3% 62.7% 15.2% \n \n\nTable 2.3 - Comparison of selectivities to propylene for each route. \n\nStep Route 1 [12] [13] Route 2 [14][15] Route 3 [16] \n\n1 40.0% Contracted Out 74.0% \n\n2 73.3% 100.0% 56.0% \n\n3  46.5%  \n \n\n\n\n20 \n \n\nOf the three options, route 2 (methanol-to-olefins) is decided to be the best option to proceed \n\nwith due to the fact that it has the highest overall conversion and selectivity to propylene. Besides \n\nthat, step 3 of route 2 produces ethylene as a co-product with a selectivity of 33.5% and it can also \n\nbe sold as a value-added chemical, summing up the selectivity of desired products to 80%. \n\n \n\n2.3 Technical Information \n \n\nBefore a final design is completed, base technical information is needed. This information \n\nis background knowledge of reaction stoichiometry, along with the corresponding conversion and \n\nselectivity, operating conditions, toxicity, and costs.  \n\n \n\n2.3.1 Conversion Steps and Operating Conditions  \n \n\nThe selected method for production of propylene from methane is the MTO (methanol to \n\nolefins) process. This process has three steps: conversion of methane synthesis gas (syngas), \n\nconversion of syngas to methanol, and conversion of methanol to propylene. The reaction \n\nconditions for each of the steps is given in Table 2.4. \n\n \nTable 2.4 \u2013 Products, conversions and selectivities of methanol-to-olefins route. \n\nStep Process Products Conversion Selectivity \n\n1 Methane to syngas Contracted Out \n\n2 [14] \nSyngas to \nmethanol CO + 2H2 ?

Because much of the propylene demand is used for \n\npolypropylene production, polymer grade product 99.5% in mol is desired.   \n\nA secondary byproduct of the reaction is ethylene, which has similar purity options as \n\npropylene. Due to same reasoning, polymer grade ethylene is decide to be a secondary product.  \n\nThis ethylene is 99.9% in mol pure [17]. \n\n \n\n2.3.3 Production Rate  \n \n\nThe desired production rate of propylene is chosen based on availability of feedstock and \n\nfeasibility of large-scale propylene production. It was decided that the amount of natural gas to be \n\nprocessed would be the maximum the contracted out company could process. As informed in the \n\nsyngas contract, found in Attachment A, this value correspond to 0.8% of the gas extracted from \n\n\n\n22 \n \n\nthe Marcellus Shale formation, which leads to a natural gas input of 83.2 MMcfd [18]. The ethylene \n\nand propylene production rate would be 1.16 million lbs/day and 1.61 million lbs/day, respectively. \n\nTo determine if this volume of gas was obtainable, the capacity of current processing \n\nstations was researched. Blue Racer Midstream in Natrium, WV currently has a capacity of \n\n200 MMcfd, with the planned addition of another 200 MMcfd.  Blue Racer\u2019s Berne, OH location \n\nis designed to accommodate three 200 MMcfd cryogenic processing units [19]. These individual \n\nlocations all process 4-6 times our required capacity, so 104 MMcfd was determined to be \n\nobtainable.   \n\nAdditionally the production rate is compared to existing plants to evaluate feasibility. HMC \n\nPolymers Company Limited has a plant in Thailand with a capacity of 300,000 metric tonnes per \n\nyear [20], or 1.89 million lbs/day. This similar production rate was used as a heuristic to further \n\nvalidate the desired production rate \n\nProducing such a large quantity of product maximize the profit margin per pound and \n\nreduce the capital cost per pound of product. Because capital costs do not scale directly with \n\nproduction capacity, a large capacity is desirable.  \n\n \n\n2.3.4 Costs and Prices  \n \n\nError! Reference source not found.2.6 shows the breakdown of the prices and cost for \nthe components involved in the process. \n\n \nTable 2.6 - Input and output materials market prices. \n\nCategory Component Material Value ($/ lb) \n\nPrimary Product Propylene [21] 0.61 \n\nSecondary \nProducts \n\nEthylene [22] 0.65 \n\nHydrogen [23] 0.31 \n\nRaw Materials \nNatural Gas [24] 0.077 \n\nWater [25] 0.0004 \n \n \n \n\n\n\n23 \n \n\n2.3.5 Toxicity  \n \n\nIn general, the components of this process don\u00b4t have high toxicity. No compounds are \n\ncarcinogenic. The major concern is asphyxiation, as the majority of the process gasses are simple \n\nasphyxiates. Because of this, proper ventilation and monitoring systems are needed for safe \n\nproduction. Additionally, many of the chemicals are flammable and can act as explosives under \n\ncertain conditions. To safely operate with exposure to flammable gasses, concentrations should be \n\nmonitored and ignition sources should be eliminated. A detailed toxicity breakdown on each \n\ncomponent can be found on Appendix A.  \n\n \n\n2.3.6 Plant Location  \n \n\nOne possible location for the proposed propylene plant is Marcus Hook, PA. This location \n\nis promising because it is home to a Braskem polypropylene plant, which can use our propylene as \n\nthe starting block for their process [26]. This reduces transportation costs and maximizes \n\nprofitability.  \n\nAdditionally, the Williams Transco pipeline supplies gas from the Marcellus Shale \n\nformation to the East Coast region [27]. This pipeline has the capacity to supply the required \n\nvolume of gas to meet our desired production. The availability of gas through this pipeline reduces \n\nany transportation or delivery costs of the raw materials. \n\n\n\n24 \n \n\n3 CONCEPTUAL PROCESS DESIGN \n \n\nIn order develop a feasibility assessment for a new production process, the chemical industry \n\nuses a series of steps, followed in this project, that are described in Chapter 2 of [28] and \n\nsummarized in Table 3.1. The very first step of such methodology, step 0, is to conduct all \n\nnecessary preliminary research described in the Background section of this report. The subsequent \n\nsteps of the conceptual process design methodology help to cover all the aspects necessary for any \n\nsuccessful new process. \n\n \nTable 3.1 - Conceptual process design steps and their descriptions. \n\nDesign Step Description \n\n1. Operation mode \nDecides whether the process is batch or \n\ncontinuous. \n\n2. Input/output structure \nIncludes the overall chemistry of the process, \n\nthe material balances, and calculation of a \nprofit potential. \n\n3. Recycle structure Evaluates the use of recycle streams. \n\n4. Initial process flow diagram \nRegards the reactor sequencing, use of some \nequipment such as heat exchangers, pumps \n\nand compressors \n\n5. Separation synthesis \nConsiders the units necessary to achieve \ndesired product purity and separation of \n\nmixed streams. \n\n6. Energy integration \nDesign for efficient energy use, as well as \n\nreduction of energy costs and inputs. \n\n \n \n\n3.1 Operation Mode \n  \n\nThe first heuristic that was used to evaluate the size of the process addressed concerned the \n\nproduction rate. A production rate higher than 5,000 metric tons per year would require a \n\ncontinuous process and a production less than 5,000 metric tons would require a batch process [28].   \n\n\n\n25 \n \n\nThe second heuristic addressed taken into consideration was the desired flexibility of the \n\nprocess. A batch process is designed to be more flexible than a continuous design because it can \n\naccommodate many different types of feed materials. The propylene production plant is only \n\ndesigned for an input of natural gas and water; therefore, it does not require flexible feed inputs. \n\nThis makes flexibility a non-determining factor in the decision of establishing a reactor mode.   \n\nTaking into account the size heuristic and the lack of flexibility of the process, it was decided \n\nthat the production mode for our conversion process is continuous. \n\n \n\n3.2 Input/output Structure \n \n An overall material balance and a calculation of the potential profit of the conversion \n\nprocess at an input/output level are performed. The overall process is represented by a block flow \n\ndiagram shown in Figure 3.1, illustrating the inputs and outputs of the process without including \n\nany intermediates. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 - Block flow diagram of the entire process on an input/output level. \n \n\nThe input streams consist of the raw material feeds of the production process. The raw \n\nmaterials for this process are natural gas and water. The output streams consist of main products \n\nethylene and propylene, hydrogen from the syngas contraction, fuel, water, a purge stream and gas \n\nwastes. Products of this process that will be used for fuel heating operations within the process are \n\ndimethyl ether, butane, and 1-butene. The waste stream leaving the process is composed of carbon \n\ndioxide, nitrogen and unreacted syngas.  \n\n\n\n26 \n \n\nA material balance was performed for inputs and outputs of the conversion process using the \n\nstream table given in the syngas contract, which can be found in Attachment A, and conversions \n\nand selectivities from Error!

For an input/output \nlevel analysis, it is assumed that all separation steps are 100% efficient. \n\n \nTable 3.2 - Stream table of the process on an input/output level in million lbs/year. \n\nComponent Natural gas \nWater \n\nin Hydrogen \nGas \n\nwaste Ethylene Propylene Fuel \nWater \n\nout \nMethane 1407 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nEthane 111 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nCO 0 0 2 877 0 0 0 0 \nHydrogen 0 0 233 124 0 0 0 0 \nCO2 20 0 3 382 0 0 18 0 \nNitrogen 13 0 0 13 0 0 0 0 \nMethanol 0 0 0 0 0 0 36 0 \nPropene 0 0 0 0 0 359 0 0 \nEthylene 0 0 0 0 258 0 0 0 \n1-Butene 0 0 0 0 0 0 67 0 \nn-Butane 0 0 0 0 0 0 70 0 \ndiM-Ether 0 0 0 0 0 0 13 0 \nH2O 0 1865 0 0 0 0 0 963 \n\nTOTAL 1551 1865 237 1396 258 359 203 963 \n \n   \n \n\nA potential profit margin calculation was also performed using the materials market prices \n\nfrom Error!

A breakdown \n\nof the potential profit margin can be found in Table 3.3. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n27 \n \n\nTable 3.3 \u2013 Breakdown of the potential profit margin of the process on an input/output level. \n\nCategory Component Material Value ($/ lb) Input/output  ($ million/year) \nPrimary Product Propylene [21] 0.61 219.0 \nSecondary \nProducts \n\nEthylene [22] 0.65 167.4 \nHydrogen [23] 0.31 73.6 \n\nRaw Materials \nNatural Gas [24] 0.077 - 119.4 \nWater [25] 0.0004 - 0,8 \n\nTOTAL   339.8 \n \n\n The potential profit of the conversion process on an input/output level is approximately \n\n$ 440 million per year, so the process design can move forward to the next step. \n\n \n\n3.3 Recycle Structure  \n \n\nIt can be noticed that a lot of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is leaving the process in the gas \n\nwaste stream due to low per pass conversion through the methanol reactor. For this reason, a recycle \n\nstream will be implemented in Step 2 of the process. Since the recycle stream contains nitrogen \n\nand carbon dioxide, a purge of 5% of this stream will be implemented to avoid accumulation of \n\ninert gases. The first and third reactors have high conversions, as shown in Table 2.4, so recycle \n\nloops are not required. \n\nWater is another reactant that is being wasted through the process, but since Step 1 is outside \n\nour plant, the implementation of a recycle stream is not considered. Figure 3.2 show the same \n\ninput/output level BFD, but considering recycle streams. \n\n \n\n\n\n28 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 - Block flow diagram of the process on an input/output level with recycle streams. \n \n\n3.4 Initial Process Flow Diagram \n \nAfter recycle stream was implemented, the method of operation and type of reactor for Steps \n\n2 and 3 were analyzed. Both reactions occur in a gas phase, so a CSTR was eliminated from \n\ncontention. Packed bed reactors were selected as the best for offering high contact area with the \n\ncatalysts.  \n\nAfter the type of reactor was selected, the method of operation was investigated. Since the \n\nreactions steps are both exothermic, large temperature changes might occur if the reactors are run \n\nadiabatically. Simulated on HYSYS, the reactors for Steps 2 and 3 running adiabatically can reach \n\ntemperatures up to 1525 \u00baF and 1302 \u00baF, respectively. Because the reaction kinetics and yield are \n\nfunctions of temperature, all reactors should be run isothermally to ensure optimal production. For \n\nthe same reason, both reactors are sized as heat exchangers to guarantee they will have enough heat \n\ntransfer area to perform the conversion at a constant temperature. \n\nThe next step in the design process was to create an initial process flow diagram in order to \n\nsize and cost equipment necessary for the preparation of each reactor feed and to operate the \n\nreactors themselves. The size and cost calculations follow the algorithms described in \n\nAppendices B of this report. \n\nThe second reaction step of our process, methanol synthesis from syngas, is shown in Figure \n\n3.3. \n\n\n\n29 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3 \u2013Syngas-to-methanol reaction section. \n \n\nThe fresh syngas provided by the contractor, stream 101, available at 527 \u00baF and 265 psia, is \n\ncompressed to the required operating pressure of the syngas to methanol reactor R-1 using \n\ncompressor C-1. The compressed stream, stream 102, now at 946,1 \u00baF and 727 psia, is then mixed \n\nwith a syngas recycle stream, stream 112, to form stream 103 at 807,4 \u00baF, which is cooled by the \n\nheat exchanger E-101 to the temperature of 427,7 \u00baF. Next, the process stream enters the packed \n\nbed reactor R-1, which converts 64% of the carbon monoxide in the syngas feed into methanol.  \n\nNote that, before designing the separation step, the conditions of the recycle stream cannot \n\nbe defined, but, to avoid a recalculation report and to make it easier to follow the report, the \n\nconditions assumed here are the conditions of the stream in the final design.

A separation section is needed to isolate the unreacted syngas from the desired \n\nintermediate, methanol, and also to eliminate most of the carbon dioxide in the stream, which would \n\ncontaminate the desired products streams. Since this is an easy gas/liquid separation, the chosen \n\nunit for this separation is a flash drum, preceded by a turbine, a valve, and a heat exchanger. The \n\nturbine T-101 decompresses the reactor outlet stream 105 from 725 to 87 psia, which is the lowest \n\nbefore condensing methanol, resulting in stream 106. A valve completes the decompressing \n\nprocess, reaching 34.8 psia in stream 107. In order to maximize the amount of methanol in the \n\nliquid stream 113, a heat exchanger cools stream 107 to 19.4 \u00b0F before going to the flash drum F-\n\n101, allowing 96.9% of the methanol and less than 0.01% of the carbon dioxide to be in the liquid \n\nstream 113. The gas stream 109 is 5% purged through stream 110. The remaining stream 111 is \n\nrecompressed back to 725 psia by compressor C-102.

The first \n\npart of this section is represented in Figure 3.6. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.6 \u2013 Primary water and CO2 separations of the methanol-to-olefins separation section. \n\n \n\n\n\n35 \n \n\nThe stream 116 exiting the methanol to olefins reactor is a gaseous stream containing water, \n\nunreacted methanol, carbon dioxide, inert gases, main products ethylene and propylene, and \n\nheavier hydrocarbons. The main objective of this separation section is to obtain high purity \n\nproducts, polymer grade ethylene and propylene, which are only 99.9 and 99.5% in mol. \n\nBased on the heuristic that the easiest separation should be performed first, making the \n\nsubsequent separations easier and less expensive [28], a flash drum is chosen to separate the water \n\nfrom the process stream. The heater exchanger E-103 is needed to cool down stream 116 from 104 \n\n\u00baF to the operating conditions of the flash drum F-102, 104 \u00b0F and 23.9 psia. This unit removes \n\n98.1% of the water in the main stream 116, which is then stream 117 with only 0.04% in mol of \n\nwater. Even though this is a small composition, it is not enough to obtain polymer grade ethylene, \n\nso a second water separation will be performed later in the process. \n\nThe goal of the second separation of this section is to remove 99.8% of the carbon dioxide of \n\nthe process stream 119. This is accomplished by absorption in diglycolamine 0.7% in weight \n\naqueous solution, stream 151. This have been already performed in a previous work [29]. Stream \n\n151 has a flow ratio of 0.25 moles of diglycolamine per mol of carbon dioxide. According to \n\nHYSYS simulation, this is only possible for one tenth of the mass flow in stream 119, so 10 sets \n\nof absorbers A-101 and regenerators DC-101 will be used. The absorbers A-101 operate at 29 psia, \n\nwhile the regenerators DC-101 operate at 21.8 psia. For this reason, a compressor C-103 is needed \n\nto raise the pressure of stream 119, resulting in stream 120. This stream flows through the absorber, \n\nexiting it as stream 121, which is less than 0.0001% in mol of carbon dioxide. Stream 151 remains \n\nin the regeneration loop. \n\n \nTable 3.10 \u2013 Primary water and CO2 separations of the methanol-to-olefins step stream table. \n\nCondition 116 117 118 119 120 121 \nVapour Fraction 1 0,30 0 1 1 1 \nTemperature [F] 710,1 104,0 104,0 104,0 116,2 147,9 \nPressure [psia] 23,9 23,9 23,9 23,9 29,0 29,0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n36 \n \n\n \n\nTable 3.10 cont. - Primary water and CO2 separations of the methanol-to-olefins step stream table. \n\nComponent \n116 117 118 119 120 121 \n\nMass flow (lb/h) \nCO 15 15 0 15 15 15 \nHydrogen 1 1 0 1 1 1 \nCO2 10924 10924 16 10907 10907 20 \nNitrogen 9 9 0 9 9 9 \nMethanol 6442 6442 6262 180 180 44 \nH2O 173964 173964 170735 3229 3229 5097 \nEthylene 46532 46532 0 46532 46532 46370 \nPropylene 64863 64863 0 64863 64863 64369 \n1-Butene 12183 12183 0 12183 12183 11942 \nn-Butane 12621 12621 0 12621 12621 12618 \ndiM-Ether 2316 2316 0 2315 2315 2041 \nDGAmine 0 0 0 0 0 17 \n\n \n\nTable 3.11 - Amine regeneration loop of the methanol-to-olefins step stream table. \n\nCondition 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 \nVapour Fraction 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0.25 \nTemperature [F] 86,0 134,8 200,0 212,0 271,4 271,4 202,4 202,4 292,2 \nPressure [psia] 29,0 29,0 21,8 21,8 21,8 29 29,0 29,0 29,0 \n\nComponent Mass flow (lb/h) \nCO 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nHydrogen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nCO2 242 11129 11129 10882 247 247 247 0 247 \nNitrogen 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nMethanol 0 127 127 127 0 0 0 0 0 \nH2O 44910 42901 42901 10515 32386 32386 3239 12522 44918 \nEthylene 0 156 156 156 0 0 0 0 0 \nPropylene 0 492 492 492 0 0 0 0 0 \n1-Butene 0 244 244 244 0 0 0 0 0 \nn-Butane 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \ndiM-Ether 0 278 278 278 0 0 0 0 0 \nDGAmine 105305 105298 105298 0 105298 105298 105298 22 105310 \n\n \n\n\n\n37 \n \n\nTable 3.12 - Costs associated with the gross water and CO2 separation of the methanol-to-olefins step. \n\nUnit Size per equipment Number Capital Cost ($ million) \nAnnual Utilities \nCost ($ million) \n\nE-104 98,7 m2 11 1,77 2,68 \nF-102 30,1 m3 1 0,15 0 \nC-103 188,4 kW 1 0,29 0,11 \nA-101  tower 10,6 m3 10 0,70 0 \nA-101  trays 0,6 m2 320 0,38 0 \nDC-101 tower 2,6 m3 10 0,30 0 \nDC-101 trays 0,24 m2 200 0,22 0 \nDC-101 condenser 0,7 m2 10 0,02 0,04 \nDC-101 reboiler 5,4 m2 10 0,10 0,50 \nP-101 1 kW 10 0,12 0,01 \nE-105 9,9 m2 10 0,18 0 \nE-106 3,3 m2 10 0,07 0,12 \n\nTOTAL    4,3 3,46 \n \n\nThe last part of the separation sections is represented in Figure 3.7. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.7 \u2013Trace water and products separation of the methanol-to-olefins step. \n\n\n\n38 \n \n\nThe reminiscent water in the process stream 121 needs to be 99.9% removed, chosen to be \n\ndone by two separation steps. First, one flash drum F-103 operating at 50 \u00baF and 29 psia, so stream \n\n121 is cooled down by heat exchanger E-106, that separates 82.7% of the water, resulting in stream \n\n122. This stream flows through desiccant beds DB-101 containg AxSorb activated alumina, which \n\nis already effectively used for this same purpose in other plants. Three vessels are needed, two of \n\nwhich operate in series while the third one is regenerating [30]. This separation removes 99.9% of \n\nthe water in the stream, resulting in process stream 126. \n\nThe next separation steps goals are to obtain streams 99.9% in mol of ethylene and 99.5% in \n\nmol of propylene. This is accomplished by two distillation columns, DC-102 and DC-103. The first \n\none operates at 512 psia, as performed in a different work [29], so a compressor C-104 and a heat \n\nexchanger E-107 are needed before it. This distillation column has 32 stages with the inlet, stream \n\n128, in the 20th one and a full reflux condenser. A condenser temperature 138.3 \u00baF is set to obtain \n\npolymer grade ethylene 99.9% in mol in stream 129. The bottom stream 130 flows through a valve \n\nthat decompresses it to 362.6 psia, the operating pressure of the second distillation column. The \n\nstream 131 enters the column in the 15th stage of its stages and a total reflux ratio of 6 is used to \n\nobtain polymer grade propylene 99.5% in mol in stream 132 and a fuel stream in stream 133. \n\n \n\nTable 3.13 - Trace water separation of the methanol-to-olefins stream table. \n\nCondition 121 122 123 124 125 126 \nVapour Fraction 1 0,93 0 1 0 1 \nTemperature [F] 147,0 50,0 50,0 50,0 104,0 104,0 \nPressure [psia] 29 29 29 29 29 29 \n\nComponent Mass Flow (lb/h) \nCO 15 15 0 15 0 15 \nHydrogen 1 1 0 1 0 1 \nCO2 19 19 0 19 0 19 \nNitrogen 9 9 0 9 0 9 \nMethanol 38 38 35 3 0 3 \nH2O 4959 4959 4563 396 396 0 \nEthylene 46375 46375 0 46375 0 46375 \nPropylene 64370 64370 0 64370 0 64370 \n\n \n\n\n\n39 \n \n\nTable 3.13 cont. - Trace water separation of the methanol-to-olefins stream table. \n\n1-Butene 11938 11938 0 11938 0 11938 \nn-Butane 12620 12620 0 12620 0 12620 \ndiM-Ether 2037 2037 0 2037 0 2037 \nDGAmine 17 17 16 0 0 0 \n\n \n\nTable 3.14 - Products separation of the methanol-to-olefins stream table. \n\nCondition 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 \nVapour Fraction 1 0,238 1 0 0,2867 0 0 \nTemperature [F] 419,6 104,0 20,1 193,0 161,5 138,3 236,7 \nPressure [psia] 514 512 512 512 363 363 363 \n\nComponent Mass Flow (lb/h) \n\nCO 15 15 15 0 0 0 0 \nHydrogen 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 \nCO2 19 19 19 0 0 0 0 \nNitrogen 9 9 9 0 0 0 0 \nMethanol 3 3 0 3 3 0 3 \nH2O 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nEthylene 46375 46375 46283 93 93 93 0 \nPropylene 64370 64370 0 64370 64370 63082 1288 \n1-Butene 11938 11938 0 11938 11938 1 11938 \nn-Butane 12620 12620 0 12620 12620 0 12620 \ndiM-Ether 2037 2037 0 2037 2037 144 1893 \nDGAmine 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n\n \n\nTable 3.15 - Costs associated with the trace water and products separation of the methanol-to-olefins step. \n\nUnit Size per equipment Number Capital Cost ($ million) \nAnnual Utilities \nCost ($ million) \n\nE-107 82,5 m2 3 0,41 0,72 \nF-103 21,4 m3 1 0,12 0 \nDB-101 54,4 m3 9 2,05 0,24 \nC-104 2644 kW 2 4,48 3,11 \nE-108 71,8 m2 3 0,24 0,24 \nDC-102 tower 10,6 m3 1 0,15 0 \n\n\n\n40 \n \n\nTable 3.15 cont. - Costs associated with the trace water and products separation of the methanol-to-\nolefins step. \n\nUnit Size per equipment Number Capital Cost ($ million) \nAnnual Utilities \nCost ($ million) \n\nDC-102 trays 0,6 m2 32 0,04 0,50 \nDC-102 condenser 87,2 m2 5 0,71 1,62 \nDC-102 reboiler 72,2 m2 2 0,24 3,52 \nDC-103 tower 285,8 m3 1 1,14 0 \nDC-103 trays 16,6 m2 30 0,58 0 \nDC-103 condenser 95,8 m2 8 1,25 0,46 \nDC-103 reboiler 83,3 m2 3 0,41 5,7 \n\nTOTAL    11.82 15,91 \n \n\nA NPV analysis, as described in Section 4 of this report, is performed and a value of \n\n$ 277 million is obtained. This value will be compared to the NPV of the heat integrations in order \n\nto decide whether they are feasible or not. \n\n \n\n3.6 Energy Integration \n \n\nThe first step of energy integration is to evaluate which heating and cooling units comprised \n\nsignificant portions of the fixed capital investment and total operating costs. This is done with the \n\npurpose of seeing where money can be saved by using energy generated in the process where \n\nneeded.  \n\n In addition to evaluating the largest potential economic savings, energy integration \n\ncomposite curves are also considered to determine the maximum amount of energy that can be \n\nrecovered. Heat flow and stream temperatures are the limiting factors that determine if integration \n\nis possible. Streams cannot transfer more heat than they possess and the stream temperatures cannot \n\nget within a certain approach temperature. If the approach temperature is too small, the heat \n\nexchanger area increases dramatically and makes the units more expensive and impractical. \n\nTables 3.16 and 3.17 show all the heating and cooling duties present in the process and \n\nFigure 3.8 show their composite curves. \n\n \n\n\n\n41 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nTable 3.16 \u2013 Heaters and reboilers duties with their respective inlet and outlet temperatures. \n\nID Type Inlet Temp  \u00baF (\u00baC) \nOutlet Temp  \n\n\u00baF (\u00baC) \nDuty \n\n(GJ/h) Fluid \n\nE-103 Heater 19.4 (-7.0) 710.0 (376.7) 295.1 Molten Salt \n\nDC-101 R Reboiler 271.4 (133.0) 271.4 (133.0) 42.2 Sat Steam (5 bar) \n\nDC-102 R Reboiler 193.0 (92.9) 193.0 (92.9) 38.1 Sat Steam (5 bar) \n\nDC-103 R Reboiler 236.7 (115.5) 236.7 (115.5) 56.1 Sat Steam (5 bar) \n \n\n \n\n \nTable 3.17 \u2013 Coolers and condensers duties with their respective inlet and outlet temperatures. \n\nID Type Inlet Temp  \u00baF (\u00baC) \nOutlet Temp  \n\n\u00baF (\u00baC) \nDuty \n\n(GJ/h) Fluid \n\nE-101 Cooler 807.4 (436.4) 427.6 (219.8) 222.4 Water \n\nR-101 Cooler 427.6 (219.8) 427.6 (219.8) 459.1 Water \n\nE-102 Cooler 164.8   (73.7) 19.4    (-7.0) 254.3 Refrigerant (-20) \n\nR-102 Cooler 710.0 (376.7) 710.0 (376.7) 123.4 Water \n\nE-104 Cooler 710.0 (376.7) 104.0   (40.0) 293.7 Water \n\nDC-101 C Condenser 212.0 (100.0) 212.0 (100.0) 14.0 Water \n\nE-106 Cooler 292.2 (144.1) 86.0   (30.0) 37.9 Refrigerated Water \nE-107 Cooler 147.0   (63.1) 50.0   (10.0) 8.3 Refrigerant (-20) \n\nE-108 Cooler 359.9 (204.4) 104.0   (40.0) 41.9 Water \n\nDC-102 C Condenser 20.5    (-6.6) 20.5   (-6.6) 27.7 Refrigerant (-20) \n\nDC-103 C Condenser 138.3   (59.2) 138.3  (59.2) 58.9 Water \n\n \n\n\n\n42 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 \u2013 Composite curves of all units with a temperature approach of 10\u00baC. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.8 shows that the total amount of energy that can be possibly integrated is 423 GJ/h. \n\nBased on the results shown in Tables 3.16 and 3.17, the most beneficial combination is the \n\nintegration of the heat exchanger E-101 with the molten salt heater E-103 because all the available \n\nheat in E-101 could be transferred to E-103, so extra heat exchangers for make-up heating on the \n\nstream of E-101 would not be necessary. This can be more easily seen when plotting the composite \n\ncurves of these two heat exchangers alone, which can be found in Figure 3.9. \n\n \n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n\nTe\nm\n\npe\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n (\no C\n\n)\n\nHeat flow (GJ/h)\n\n\n\n43 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9 \u2013 Composite curves of units E-101 and E-103. \n\n \nThis integration achieves complete cooling of stream 103 to stream 104, thus these streams \n\nremain unchanged. However, some trim heating needs to be done to stream 113 after integration \n\nso that it can achieve desired 376,7 \u00baC. Because of this trim heating, a molten salt heater is still \n\nneeded to heat stream now called 213 from 309 \u00b0C to 377 \u00b0C, resulting in stream 214.  \n\nDespite the need for trim heating, no additional units are needed and the heat duty of the \n\nmolten salt heater decreases considerably. Both the operating and capital costs are lowered for both \n\nunits as seen in Table 3.18 \n\n \n\nTable 3.18 \u2013 Capital and utilities costs of E-101 and E-103 before and after heat integration. \n\nCost type \nE-101 E-103 \n\nBefore After Before After \n\nCapital costs ($ million) 3,12 1,53 9,84 2,90 \n\nUtilities costs ($ million/year) 1,96 0 9,41 2,54 \n \n\nHeat integration was found to increase to approximately $ 329 million.

profit value (NVP) analysis is a discounted technique for the evaluation of \n\nprofitability of a project, which means it takes into account the time value of money. This analysis \n\nbrings future money incomes to the present multiplying them by their respective discount factors, \n\nconsidering that a certain amount of money in the future is worth less in present. The methodology \n\nused in this project is described in chapter 10 of [28]. The expression for the calculation of the NVP \n\nis: \n\n??? =  ???? + {?|?, ?, ?}(? ? ??) + {?|?, ?, ?}(?? + ??) \n\nWhere ??? is total capital investment project, ? is the estimated minimum acceptable rate \n\nof return (MARR), ? is the project lifetime, ? is the annual sales, ?? is the annual manufacturing \n\ncost of the project, ?? is the salvage value and ?? is the working capital of the project. {?|?, ?, ?} \n\nis the uniform series present worth factor or present worth of annuity and {?|?, ?, ?} is the single \n\npayment present worth factor. \n\nAccording to Table 9.1 of [28], the discount factors can be expressed as: \n\n{?|?, ?, ?} =\n(1 + ?)? ? 1\n\n?(1 + ?)?\n \n\n{?|?, ?, ?} =\n1\n\n(1 + ?)?\n \n\nAs suggested by [25], a minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR) of 30% is assumed for \n\na project lifetime of 10 years. The discount factor can be then calculated: \n\n{?|?, ?, ?} = 3.0915 \n\n{?|?, ?, ?} = 0.0725 \n\n \n\n4.1 Total Capital Investment \n \n\nThe total capital investment of the project is the summation of all the costs associated with \n\nthe building and the startup of the process, being expressed as Equation 9.21 in [28]: \n\n??? = ???2,3 + ??2,3 + ???1 \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n \n\nWhere ???2,3 is the fixed capital investment of our plant, ??2,3 is the working capital of \n\nour plant and ???1 is the total capital investment for the syngas contraction. \n\nThe fixed capital investment includes four different types of costs: \n\nx Direct project expenses, related to the purchase of the equipment, piping, insulation \n\nand fireproofing, foundations and structural supports, instrumentation and \n\ninstallation. \n\nx Indirect project expense, which includes transportation of equipment and materials \n\nto the plant site, salaries and benefits to operators during installation, such as \n\nvacation, sick leave and retirement. \n\nx Contingency and fee, to cover unforeseen circumstance, for example, storms, \n\nchanges in design or unpredicted price increase. \n\nx Auxiliary facilities, accounting for purchase of land, excavation, water and sewer \n\nsystems, construction of administration offices, control rooms, storages, etc. \n\nAs suggested in Section 7.3.7 of [28], the direct and indirect costs of our plant can be \n\napproximated with the summation of the bare module costs of all equipment in our plant. Using \n\nthe grassroots approach, the contingency and fee costs are estimated as 15% and 3% of the direct \n\nand indirect costs, respectively, while the auxiliary facilities costs are evaluated as 50% of the total \n\nbare module costs of all equipment if they were under ambient conditions: \n\n???2,3 = ??? 2,3 + ??? 2,3 + ??? 2,3 \n\n??? 2,3 = 0.18 ??? 2,3 \n\n??? 2,3 = 0.5 ???\n0\n\n2,3 \n\n Where is ??? 2,3 is total bare module costs of equipment, ??? 2,3 is the contingency and fee \n\ncosts, ??? 2,3  is the auxiliary facilities cost and ???\n0\n\n2,3  is the total bare module costs of all \n\nequipment at ambient conditions, all for our plant. \n\nThe bare module costs for all of the units in the production process were summed and \n\nsummarized in Table 4.1. The sizing and costing calculations for the units in the plant are located \n\nin Appendices B. \n\n\n\n \n\n54 \n \n\n \nTable 4.1 \u2013 Breakdown of total bare module costs of equipment in our plant. \n\nEquipment \n????,? \n\n($ million) \n???\n\n?\n?,? \n\n($ million) \nAdsorption and Regeneration Columns 1.96 1.96 \nCompressors 74.28 74.28 \nTurbines 13.74 13.74 \nDesiccant Beds 2.05 2.05 \nDistillation Columns 4.52 4.34 \nFlash Drums 1.86 1.70 \nHeat Exchangers 6.37 6.34 \nMolten Salt Heaters 2.91 2.91 \nPumps 0.12 0.12 \nReactors 11.35 11.17 \n\nTOTAL  119.15 118.61 \n \n\nThe auxiliary facilities and the contingency and fee costs were added to obtain the fixed \n\ncapital investment of our plant. Table 4.2 shows each of these costs separately. \n\n \nTable 4.2 \u2013 Breakdown of fixed capital investment of our plant. \n\nCost type Value ($ million) \nTotal bare module, ??? 2,3 119.15 \nContingency and Fee, ??? 2,3 21.45 \nAuxiliary Facilities, ??? 2,3 59.30 \n\nFixed Capital Investment, ???2,3 199.90 \n \n\nThe working capital is the amount of capital required to initiate the plant and to maintain \n\nthe operation for the first months before sales. It is usually used to cover salaries and raw material \n\ninventories. According to section 9.7.1 of [28], typical values of working capital range from 15 to \n\n20% of the fixed capital investment. A median value for our plant will be considered in this project: \n\n??2,3 = 0.175 ???2,3 \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n \n\nThe total fixed capital investment of our plant from Table 8 was added to fixed capital \n\ninvestment of the syngas contraction, which can be found on Attachment A, and the working capital \n\nin order to obtain the total capital investment. Table 4.3 shows how the total capital investment \n\nwas obtained. \n\nTable 4.3 \u2013 Breakdown of the total capital investment. \n\nCost type Value ($ million) \nFixed capital investment of our plant, ???2,3 199.90 \nWorking capital of our plant, ??2,3 34.98 \nTotal capital investment of syngas contraction, ???1 108.28 \n\nTotal Capital Investment, ??? 343.16 \n \n \n\n4.2 Sales \n \n\nBesides propylene, ethylene and hydrogen can also be sold as secondary products of this \n\nplant. Table 4.4 shows the total income breakdown of sales using the mass flows obtained from \n\nHYSYS. \n\nTable 4.4 \u2013 Break down of sales. \n\nComponent Value ($/lb) \nMass flow \n\n(lb/h) \nSales \n\n($ million/year) \nPropylene [21] 0.61 63320 324.45 \nEthylene [22] 0.65 46328 252.95 \nHydrogen [23] 0.31 28258 73.58 \n\nTotal sales, ?  650.98 \n \n \n\n4.3 Manufacturing Costs \n \n\nThe manufacturing costs are the ones related to the continuous capital used for the operation \n\nof the plant and can be divided in 3 different types: \n\n\n\n \n\n56 \n \n\nx Direct costs, associated to the costs of raw material, waste treatment, utilities, operating \n\nlabor, supervisory, maintenance, repairs, operating supplies, laboratory charges, \n\npatents and royalties. \n\nx Fixed costs, which accounts for depreciation, local taxes, insurance, fire protection, \n\nsafety services, cafeteria, etc. \n\nx General expenses, including administration costs, salaries, distribution and selling \n\ncosts, marketing, and research and development. \n\nIncluding the manufacturing costs of the syngas contraction, the manufacturing costs of this \n\nprocess can be approximated as in Equation 8.2 of [28]: \n\n?? = 0.28 ???2,3 + 2.73 ??? 2,3 + 1.23 (??? 2,3 + ??? 2,3 + ???) + ??1 \n\nWhere is ???2,3 is the fixed capital investment, ??? 2,3 is the cost of operating labor, ??? 2,3 \n\nis the utilities costs, ??? 2,3 is the costs for waste treatment, all of our plant, ??? is the cost of the \n\nraw materials, and ??1 is the manufacturing costs of the syngas contraction, which can be found \n\nin Attachment A. Note that the syngas contraction includes the costs of the natural gas reforming, \n\nbut not the natural gas and water themselves. \n\nThe cost of operating labor can be estimated multiplying the number of operators per shift, \n\n???, by a factor of 4.5 in order to cover all the rotating shifts throughout the year and by the average \n\nannual salary of an operator of $ 59,580, as described on Section 8.2 of [28]: \n\n??? 2,3 = ??? 2,3 ? 4.5 ? $ 59,580 \n \n\n??? 2,3 = (6.29 + 31.7 ?2,3\n2 + 0.23 ??? 2,3)\n\n0.5\n \n\nWhere is ?2,3 is the number of processing steps involving the handling of particulate solid \n\nand ??? 2,3  is the number of nonparticulate processing steps, including compression, heating, \n\ncooling, mixing and reaction in our plant. \n\nIn this plant, there is no processing step involving the handling of particulate, but 288 \n\nequipment involving nonparticulate processes, so: \n\n??? 2,3 = 8 \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n \n\n??? 2,3 = $ 2.14 ???????/???? \n\n \n\nThe utilities costs for all of the units in the production process were summed and \n\nsummarized in Table 4.5. The sizing and costing calculations for the units in the plant are located \n\nin Appendices B. \n\nTable 4.5 \u2013 Breakdown of total utilities costs of equipment in the plant. \n\nEquipment \n????,? \n\n($ million/year) \nAdsorption Columns 0.66 \nCompressors 53.02 \nTurbines -16.45 \nDesiccant Bed 0.24 \nDistillation Columns 11.31 \nFlash Drums 0.00 \nHeat Exchangers 20.47 \nMolten Salt Heater 2.54 \nPumps 0.01 \nReactor 5.31 \n\nTOTAL 77.11 \n \n \n\nSince there is no waste to be treated in our plant: \n \n\n????,? = ? \n \n\nTable 4.6 shows the total outcome breakdown of raw materials purchase using the mass \n\nflows obtained from HYSYS. \n\n \nTable 4.6 \u2013 Break down of raw material costs. \n\nComponent Value ($/lb) \nMass flow \n\n(lb/h) \n??? \n\n($ million/year) \nNatural Gas [24] 0.077 184648 119.43 \nWater [24] 0.0002 222008 0.37 \n\nTOTAL  119.80 \n \n\n\n\n \n\n58 \n \n\n \nThe manufacturing costs can now be calculated.

It is worthy to investigate new ways to process the natural \n\ngas and find alternative ways to use it and not only as an energy source. Because of the desire to \n\nrejuvenate the United States\u2019, and more specifically Pennsylvania\u2019s, stagnant manufacturing \n\nindustry and keep this new valuable resource locally.  \n\nThe important conclusions from this report are as follows:  \n\nx Propylene are the chemicals chosen for having the best potential profitability and \n\nmarketability.  \n\nx The chemical scheme chosen for the production of propylene is the methanol to olefin \n\nmethod (MTO). This method converts methane to synthesis gas, which is then \n\nconverted into methanol and then propylene. As by product, ethylene is produced, \n\nwhich is also marketable. \n\nx The technical feasibility is determined using a simulation software and previous work \n\ndata. \n\nx The economic feasibility is determined calculating a net present value (NPV), which is \n\nused to determine a minimum selling value. The minimum selling price of propylene is \n\nfound to be $0.56/lb, compared to the current market price of $0.65/lb. The minimum \n\nselling price of propylene is found to be $0.52/lb, compared to the current market price \n\nof $0.61/lb. \n\nThe information on this report could now be used to prove the feasibility for making \n\npropylene from natural gas. \n\nBased on the results discussed in this document, we recommend the following:  \n\nx Investigate further the kinetics of the MTO process to explore the possibility of forming \n\nbyproducts with a higher order of carbon than butane.  \n\nx Investigate further the operating conditions and performance of the desiccant beds. This \n\nmay incur a larger compressor duty needed to perform these separation processes, \n\nwhich would increase the processes respective capital and operating costs. \n\n\n\n \n\n63 \n \n\nx Proceed to the next phase of process design.  This includes a more detailed estimation \n\nof the design with more precise specifications for all utilities, equipment, \n\ninstrumentation, electrical and offsite needs.  \n\n\n\n \n\n64 \n \n\n6 REFERENCES \n \n\n1.

Maneval and Ryan C. Snyder \n \n\nProject Supervisors, Process Engineering Department \n \nSubject: Syngas System Design and Cost Estimation \n \nPer the request you delivered, here is an estimate from our syngas facility contractor. Keep in mind \nthat this estimate is also at the same level of certainty of other estimates you will make using \ncorrelations from Turton or the Green Report. Thus, once the design of your entire process is \ncompleted, you should view these numbers with no more and no less certainty than others you are \nusing. More detailed requests may even be possible. \n \nNatural gas to be treated: \n \n\n\u2022 Composition: 0.95 CH4, 0.04 C2H6, 0.005 CO2 and 0.005 N2 \n \n\n\u2022 Flow rate needed = 31,000 lbmol/hr \n \n\u2022 Requested H2:CO molar ratio = 2:1 \n\n \nOn the basis of a 2:1 H2:CO ratio, as requested, this flow rate translates to 330,670 lb/h or 150,300 \nkg/h of syngas product to be delivered. This is essentially at the upper end of the production rate \nthat our contractor is willing to provide quotes for. If your needs change in excess of this figure, \nplease contact us for a re-evaluation. The syngas will be delivered to you at 275 ?C and 18 atm \nwhile the hydrogen by-product stream will be available at 25 ?C and 2 atm. \n    \nTable 1 summarizes the mass flows (in kg/hr) for your syngas production process. Note that in \naddition to the required flow of a natural gas feed stream, there is a corresponding hydrogen by-\n\n\n\n \n\n112 \n \n\nproduct stream (needed to achieve your specified H2:CO mole ratio) and an associated water input \nstream required as a raw material to generate the syngas per your specification. \n \n \nTable 1: Component mass flows for the production of 150,300 kg/hr of syngas with a 2:1 H2:CO \n\nmole composition. All flows are in kg/hr. \n\nComponent Input NG Input Water \nSyngas \nproduct \n\nHydrogen \nproduct \n\nhydrogen 0.00 0.00 18787.50 12590.98 \nmethane 75960.01 0.00 0.00 0.00 \n\nethane 5996.84 0.00 0.00 0.00 \nnitrogen 699.63 0.00 699.63 0.00 \n\nCO 0.00 0.00 131512.50 88.23 \nCO2 1099.42 0.00 20640.42 138.64 \n\nwater 0.00 100701.99 0.00 0.00 \n \n \nThe cost estimates for this process are provided at two levels. First, the capital investment and \nmanufacturing cost required for a Level 3 analysis (the reactor(s) and compressor(s) manufacturing \nand capital costs, only) are given by: \n \n\nCI = $54,150,000 \n \n\nMC = $50,500,000/year \n \nSecond, the capital investment and manufacturing cost for the entire syngas process (Level 3 \n\nanalysis plus capital and manufacturing costs associated with separation operations) are given by: \n \n\nCI = $108,280,000 \n \n\nMC = $126,250,000/year \n \nPlease let us know if you have any questions."}]}}}
