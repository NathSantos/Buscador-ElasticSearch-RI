Os veios de fluorita s\u00e3o de idade Cret\u00e1cea e enconfram-se controlados por sistemas de falhas transcorrentes, subverticais. Al\u00e9m da fluorita, estes veios tamb\u00e9m est\u00e3o compostos por calcedonia, localmente pirita e, eventualmente, coffinita e pitchblenda. Os veios mostram texturas t\u00edpicas de preenchimento de espa\u00e7os abertos (bandamento, crustifica\u00e7\u00e3o, brechamento, geodos, etc) e est\u00e3o intimamente relacionados com intensa silicifica\u00e7\u00e3o e arg\u00edlitiza\u00e7\u00e3o das rochas gran\u00edticas hospedeiras.\nTr\u00eas sucessivos est\u00e1gios de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o foram distinguidos por evid\u00eancias de campo, atrav\u00e9s da cronologia relativa de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de fluorita, dados de ETR e inclus\u00f5es fluidas em fluorita. Estes est\u00e1gios mostram geralmente padr\u00f5es de ETR pouco fracionados (La/Yb=1.4 - 14), notando-se que a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos ETR na fluorita \u00e9 principalmente governada pelo fracionamento dos ETR leves. Sugere-se que a composi\u00e7\u00e3o em ETR do fluido hidrotermal e, consequentemente, da fluorita, foram amplamente controlados pela diferente mobilidade dos ETR leves a depender do tipo de altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal. Enquanto uma lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o preferencial de ETR pesadas sobre ETR leves ocorreu durante a altera\u00e7\u00e3o sil\u00edcica e arg\u00edlica, nesta \u00faltima, os ETR leves praticamente n\u00e3o foram removidos.\nAs temperaturas de homogeneiza\u00e7\u00e3o total de inclus\u00f5es fluidas aquosas, prim\u00e1rias, occorreram invariavelmente na fase liquida entre 187\u00b0C e 104 \u00b0C. com concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de valores em tomo de 160'C. 136\u00b0C e 116\u00b0C (est\u00e1gios Lile IH, respectivamente), definindo uma marcante tend\u00eancia de resfriamento da solu\u00e7\u00e3o. Este resfriamento est\u00e1 associado com importantes varia\u00e7\u00f5es na JO2 do flu\u00eddo, de oxidante a redutor, inferido a partir da rela\u00e7\u00e3o Eu/Eu* e da assembleia mineral (pirita, pitchblenda e coffinita). As inclus\u00f5es aquosas nestes tr\u00eas est\u00e1gios de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de fluorita mostram temperaturas de fus\u00e3o do gelo no intervalo entre -0,3\u00b0C - +0,4\u00b0C, indicando que o fluido mineralizante sempre manteve uma salinidade muito baixa, pr\u00f3xima a \u00e1gua pura. N\u00e3o foram encontradas evidencias de ebuli\u00e7\u00e3o nem mistura de fluidos. Os dados de inclus\u00f5es fluidas sugerem que os tr\u00eas est\u00e1gios de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o propostos foram o resultado de um \u00fanico e progressivo evento hidrotermal e suportam um reservat\u00f3rio \u00fanico e uniforme para as solu\u00e7\u00f5es mineralizantes, provavelmente de \u00e1guas mete\u00f3ricas aquecidas e n\u00e3o de fluidos gerados em zonas mais profundas da crosta.\nUNIVERSIDADE ESTADUAL DE CAMPINAS INSTITUTO DE GEOCI\u00caNCIAS/DEPTO.

The fluorite veins, of Cretaceous age, occupy steeply dipping, strike-slip fault zones and are composed of fluorite and chalcedony, locally pyrite and, eventually, coffinite and pitchblende. These veins show typical open-space-filling textures and are closely related with pervasive silicic and argillic alteration of the hosted granite.\nThree successive stages of mineralization were distinguished on the basis of vein chronology, REE data and fluid inclusions study in fluorite ores. These stages generally display slightly fractionated REE patterns (La/Yb=1.4-14), with REE behavior given by a relatively stronger TREE fractionation with respect to HREE. Thus, it is suggested that the REE composition of the fluids responsible for fluorite deposition was largely controlled by a different mobility of the REE during the silicic or argillic alteration of the host granite. Preferential leaching of HREE over TREE occurred during both alteration types, but in the argillic alteration the LREE were practically not removed.\nThe total homogenization temperatures of primary-like aqueous inclusions took place invariably in the liquid phase at temperatures ranging from 187\u00b0C to 104 \u00b0C, with concentration of values around 160\u00b0C, 136\u00b0C and 116\u00b0C (stage I, II and ID, respectively), defining a clear trend of fluid cooling. This cooling is accompanied by large changes in the fih of the fluid, from oxidizing to reducing, as inferred from the Eu/Eu* ratios and the mineral assemblage (pyrite, pitchblende and coffinite). The three stages of fluorite depositions exhibit temperature of ice melting within the interval -0.3GC - +0,4\u00b0C, indicating that the mineralizing fluids were exclusively aqueous and highly diluted. No evidence of fluid mixture or boiling were found. The fluid inclusion data suggest that the proposed three stages of mineralization was probably the result of a single hydrothermal event and strongly support a single and uniform fluid reservoir for the ore-forming solutions, probably heated meteoric waters rather than fluids generated in deep-seated environments within the crust.\nvil\nI.\tINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O\nI. INTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O\nNo setor sul das Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba, Sierras Pampeanas da Argentina, uma s\u00e9rie de fil\u00f5es de fluorita encontram-se encaixados em rochas gran\u00edticas Paleozoicas pertencentes ao bat\u00f3lito Cerro Aspero, em urna \u00e1rea de aproximadamente 440 Km2 (Fig. 1). Estas mineraliza\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e3o hospedadas em monzogranitos epizonais que se colocam em um complexo metam\u00f3rfico de m\u00e9dio grau, de idade Pr\u00e9cambriana - Paleozoica inferior.\n\u00d1as \u00faltimas tr\u00eas d\u00e9cadas, estes dep\u00f3sitos tiveram longos per\u00edodos de inatividade na minera\u00e7\u00e3o devido a instabilidade do mercado intemo associado aos baixos teores em CaF2 do min\u00e9rio e dificuldades de acesso \u00e0s minas. Em 1992, a empresa Fluorita C\u00f3rdoba S.A. retomou a minera\u00e7\u00e3o da mina Cerros Negros (Fig. 1) a um ritmo de 1500 ton/m\u00eas, com um conte\u00fado m\u00e9dio de 56% de CaF2. A mina Cerros Negros, destaca-se por ser o \u00fanico dep\u00f3sito de fluorita atualmente em produ\u00e7\u00e3o na Argentina. O acondicionamento das antigas instala\u00e7\u00f5es de flota\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00eam permitido a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de um material de alta qualidade (superior a 98% de CaF2), onde parte \u00e9 utilizado na ind\u00fastria qu\u00edmica e na de eletrodos, o restante, \u00e9 exportado.\nO Departamento de Geologia da Universidad Nacional de R\u00edo Cuarto (UNRC), Provincia de C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina, v\u00eam realizando estudos nesta \u00e1rea h\u00e1 mais de dez anos e os resultados t\u00eam permitido o mapeamento e caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o petrol\u00f3gica do bat\u00f3lito Cerro Aspero, na escala 1:60.000, assim como a abordagem da metalog\u00eanese associada, particularmente no que se refere aos dep\u00f3sitos de fluorita.\nA controv\u00e9rsia sobre a idade e a fonte dos elementos destas jazidas constata-se desde os primeiros estudos de Geologia Econ\u00f4mica realizados na d\u00e9cada do 70. Assim, a opini\u00e3o sobre a g\u00eanese estava dividida entre a teoria tradicional de filia\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal magm\u00e1tica (magma gran\u00edtico do Cerro Aspero) e a teoria que associava a forma\u00e7\u00e3o da fluorita \u00e0 atividade hidrotermal do vulc\u00e2nismo Terci\u00e1rio, o qual tem escassa manifesta\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1rea. Galindo et al. (1997) utilizando is\u00f3topos de Sr e Sm-Nd em fluorita e rochas hospedeiras sugerem que a fluorita foi formada durante o Cret\u00e1ceous inferior (117 \u00b1 26 Ma) e que sua composi\u00e7\u00e3o isot\u00f3pica deriva\ndas rochas hospedeiras.\nNeste estudo, a origem, composi\u00e7\u00e3o e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o f\u00edsica e qu\u00edmica dos fluidos respons\u00e1veis pela deposi\u00e7\u00e3o da fluorita no bat\u00f3lito Cerro \u00c1spero \u00e9 abordada a partir da determina\u00e7\u00e3o da seq\u00fc\u00eancia relativa da deposi\u00e7\u00e3o da fluorita, de dados de inclus\u00f5es fluidas em fluorita e de elementos terras raras (ETR) em fluorita, granitos e na altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal.\nPrimeiramente foi efetuado o mapeamento e amostragem nas frentes de lavra dos principais dep\u00f3sitos de fluorita do bat\u00f3lito (Fig. 1). Posteriormente, foram efetuados estudos mineral\u00f3gicos, mediante petrografia convencional, microscopia eletr\u00f4nica de varredura, e inclus\u00f5es fluidas em fluorita, incluindo microespectroscopia Raman a laser. Todos estes estudos foram desenvolvidos no Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias -UNICAMP- Campinas. As determina\u00e7\u00f5es dos ETR em fluorita foram realizadas por ativa\u00e7\u00e3o com n\u00eautrons (INAA) no Instituto de Pesquisas Energ\u00e9ticas e Nucleares (IPEN/CNEN), S\u00e3o Paulo. As determina\u00e7\u00f5es dos ETR nas rochas gran\u00edticas hospedeiras e as altera\u00e7\u00f5es hidrotermais associadas foram obtidas segundo o m\u00e9todo de plasma indutivamente acoplado - espectrometria de massa (ICP-MS) no Activation Laboratories LTD, Canad\u00e1.\nParte da metodologia seguida nesta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 detalhada nos trabalhos de Marchand et al.

In the southern part of this province almost all the fluorite veins are restricted to an area of 440 km2 within the Cerro Aspero batholith (Fig. 1), from which 666.000 t of CaF2 ore has been estimated as reserves (Menoyo and Brodkorb, 1975). Most of the fluorite production has been derived from the Cerros Negros and Bubu deposits and, in minor proportions, from the La Saida and Francisco deposits (Fig. 1). At present, Cerros Negros is the only vein-type fluorite deposit being exploited in Argentina, with calculated reserves of270.0001 and average grade of 56% of CaF2.\nCONIGLIO ET AL.\nThese deposits are hosted by Paleozoic, post-tectonic porphyritic biotite monzogranites that intruded, at shallow depths, upper Precambrian-lower Paleozoic medium to high grade metamorphic rocks.\nThe veins occupy steeply dipping, NE, E-W and NW-striking fault zones and the mineralogy is predominantly fluorite and chalcedony, which display typical open-space-filling texture. Occasionally pyrite and uranium minerals also occur.\nPrevious studies focused mainly on the geology and mineralogy of these veins were made by Gonzalez Diaz (1972) and Coniglio (1992, 1993). They emphasized that the veins were generated by multiple stages of opening and sealing, however, no detailed description of the mineral deposition sequence was made. Galindo et al.(1997), based on Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic geochemistry of fluorite veins and host rocks, postulated that the mineralization took place in the lower Cretaceous, during late Gondwanian extensional tectonic regime, and that the host rocks were an important as REE source of the hydrothermal fluids.\nAlthough these studies contributed to a better understanding of the genesis of these fluorite deposits, no strong evidence was provided indicating the physic-chemical characteristics, evolution, and possible sources for the ore-forming fluids.\nIn this study, the determination of the relative sequence of fluorite deposition, together with fluid inclusion study in fluorite and REE data in the ore and host rocks, permitted to further constrain the thermal and chemical history of the fluids responsible for the ore deposition.\nGeological Setting\nThe Cerro Aspero batholith is located in the southern part of the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba in the eastern Sierras Pampeanas of Argentina (Fig 1).\nThe Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba are constituted by Upper Precambrian to Paleozoic plutonic-metamorphic basement which is locally covered by continental deposits and mafic volcanic rocks, assigned as Cretaceous in age (Gordillo and Lencinas, 1979). The basement was uplifted as north-south trending blocks as a result of the Andean orogeny (Jordan and Allmendinger, 1986).\nVEIN-TYPE FL UORITE DEPOSITS\nThe Cerro Aspero batholith is an elliptical body comprising three main sub-circular plutons that intrude migmatites, gneisses, amphibolites, marbles, ultramafic and mafic rocks in upper amphibolite facies. Lower Cambrian age was suggest for the metamorphic peak (Rapela et al, 1995; Stuart Smith et al., 1996). The emplacement of the batholith is interpreted to have taken place during the mid to upper Devonian. The Rb/Sr age of 369 \u00b1 9 Ma and a K/Ar age of 389 \u00b1 19 Ma probably reflect the magma crystallization and the cooling age of the granitics rocks, respectively (Pinotti, 1998).\nThe Cerro Aspero batholith is characterized by a high lithological homogeneity dominated by monzogranitic compositions, although, exceptionally, granodioritic rocks also occur.\nThree main granitic types were recognized as dominant in the Cerro Aspero batholith (Coniglio and Esparza, 1988; Porta, 1992; Pinotti, 1998), but only the first two are considered as the most representative:\n(1)\tPorphyritic to coarse-grained equigranular biotite monzogranite (PBM) which comprises nearly 80% of the batholith. The PBM granite is characterized by microcline phenocrysts, up to 14 cm long, which constitute 15% to 30% of the volume of the rocks. Microcline also occurs in the groundmass together with oligoclase, quartz and biotite. Apatite, zircon, sphene, rutile, monazite, xenotime, fluorite, allanite, pyrite, and Ti and Fe oxides are the main accessory minerals. Fluorite is present as inclusions from 5 to 120 pm in size inside biotite or, less frequently, as interstitial crystals. Fine-grained enclaves rich in biotite and apatite are frequently present within the PBM granite.\n(2)\tA two-mica leuco-monzogranite (LM) which frequently occupies the upper portions of the batholith as roughly tabular sub-horizontal bodies. In the southern part of the batholith this granite forms a prominent annular shape and appears emplaced between the metamorphic host rocks and the PBM granite, with which it shows sharp contact relationships. The LM granite is composed of microcline, oligoclase, quartz and muscovite \u00b1 biotite and displays a medium to coarse-grained equigranular texture. The accessory minerals are less abundant than in PBM granite and are mainly apatite, rutile and pyrite. Greisenization, commonly bearing fluorite, is frequent in this rock.\nCONIGLIOETAL\n(3)\tFine-grained monzogranite and aplo-pegmatitic dikes (MD) intruding both the PBM and LM granites and, locally, the metamorphics rocks. They were emplaced either as subhorizontal dikes or as cone-sheet dikes. Muscovite dominates over biotite and scarce garnet occur in the more leucocratic dikes.\nThe granites of the Cerro Aspero suite belong to a high-K calc-alkaline series and display a progressive peraluminous trend from PBM to MD granite in relation to the magmatic differentiation (Porta, 1992; Pinotti, 1998). These granites have high contents of large-ion lithophile elements, as well as P and Ti.\nThe magmatic-hydrothermal stage of this granites is characterized by extensive tungsten-bearing quartz veins and disseminated Mo-W mineralization, which were largely mined during the Second World War (Fernandez Lima et al., 1963; Hillar, 1968; Gonzalez Diaz, 1972). In both cases, fluorite is a conspicuous gangue mineral. In contrast, the economic fluorite deposits belong to a low temperature vein-type category and were formed without temporal relation with the crystallization of magma. On a regional scale, these deposits have similar characteristics to those hosted in the Achala batholith (Fig. 1) (Paredes, 1987; Galindo et al., 1997), and constitute the easternmost fluorite veins of a wide belt of approximately 400 km (Magliola Mundet, 1990).\nGeology of the Vein-Type Fluorite Deposits\nModes of occurrence\nThe fluorite deposits occur as veins uniformly distributed throughout the margin of the Cerro Aspero batholith and frequently close to the contact with the enclosing metamorphic rocks.\nThe veins occupy steeply dipping, NE, E-W and NW strike-slip regional fault zones, along which they extend up to 400 meters, with thickness varying from a few centimeters up to 12 meters. At the Cerros Negros deposit the present mining operations exposed the veins at a depth of 70 m, but drilling revealed that the veins may continue to as far as 200 m deep.\nThe economic fluorite deposits are hosted only by the PBM granite, and no major veins are known to occur within other granitic rock types or in the enclosing metamorphic rocks.\nII.5\nVEIN-TYPE FLUORITE DEPOSITS\nThe mineralogy of the veins is simple and is mainly of fluorite associated with chalcedony, pyrite and minor uranium minerals. The veins commonly display banded, cockade, crustiform, and colloform textures, typical of an environment of open-space-filling. Chalcedony veinlets of millimeter to meter width are commonly found either intercalated with the fluorite banding or intimately intergrown with fluorite and, in these cases, the grade of CaF2 can be as low as 30%.\nDark fluorite spatially associated with economic uranium concentrations (pitchblende and secondary uranium minerals) is particularly present at the Estela Mine (Fig. 1). Stipanicic et al. (1982) pointed out that this association could be only fortuitous and that the genetic relation between fluorite and uranium minerals has never been proved. These authors relate the formation of vein-uranium deposits in Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba to the Tertiary. The mining operations at Estela mine closed down in the end of the 80\u2019s, and the uranium mineralization is now buried by environmental preservation works.\nThe upper parts of the fluorite veins at Cerro Aspero present a supergene alteration evidenced by conspicuous leaching of fluorite, late oxidation of pyrite and locally formation of secondary uranium minerals.\nMost of the fluorite structure were reactivated several times during the Andean orogeny. However, the deformation remained concentrated along narrow shear zones in the veins, or in the selvage zone parallel to the general strike of the veins, without modifying the original mineral deposition sequence.\nHydrothermal Alteration\nThe hydrothermal alteration associated with the fluorite deposits is concentrated particularly in the PBM granite and, subordinately, in the LM granite. In contrast, the metamorphic rocks show negligible effects of alteration. This evidence and the lack of mineralization in these rocks suggest that they acted as a strong lithological control for the hydrothermal fluids.\nCONIGL1O ET AL.\nThe altered zones around the fluorite veins may be up 10 m width and extend generally up to 2 km in length. In some cases, as in the Francisco mine area, they may reach up to 5 km along strike. In all the investigated deposits one side of the wall rock consists of silicified granite and the other side of mylonitic granite altered to an argillic assemblage. In addition, evidences of recurrent formation of these alteration types were found. Sericitic alteration is uncommon and only locally observed, as for instance at the Bubu, Ubaldina and Estela deposits, generally associated with incipient silicification. Exceptionally, the uranium mineralization at Estela mine also exhibits scarce propylitic alteration.\nSilicic alteration. This alteration is remarkably widespread throughout the fluorite deposits and evidently occurred during all the mineralizing process, although with varying intensity. Within the fault domains, silicification forms pervasive zones with fine-grained, jasperoid-like quartz in the monzogranite rocks, and comprises the best field evidence for the fluorite exploration. The most prominent feature indicating silicification is a red to brown color acquired by the granitic rocks, due to the decomposition of biotite into hydrous iron oxides. The replacement of biotite by muscovite (or rarely chlorite) and the \"rubefaction\" of microcline are typical of the initial changes in the altered zones. Microcline is incipiently replaced by secondary quartz associated with coeval formation of sericite and argillic minerals (Fig. 2A). At this stage the original texture of the rocks remains relatively preserved. In an advanced stage of silicification, the original texture of the rock is totally obliterated and the granitic minerals are replaced by quartz in a fine-grained to aphanitic texture, which in turn undergoes strong brecciation, with clasts cemented by cryptocrystalline quartz or chalcedony (Fig. 2B). This results in development of multidirectional quartz veinlets and almost mono- mineralic alteration of the granitic rocks.\nArgillic alteration. This is characterized by the predominance of kaolinite in the premineral stage, generally associated with silicic alteration, whereas montmorrillonite and illite are better developed during fluorite deposition (Coniglio, 1993). In this case, fragments of argillitized granite are common in mineralized breccias, and frequently the fluorite vugs are filled with clay\nII.7\nVEIN-TYPE FL U0R1TE DEPOSITS\nminerals. Tn zones of intense faulting, as at Bubu, or locally at the La Saida and Cerros Negros deposits, a strong bleaching of the altered rocks is typical The granite is heavily fragmented and its feldspar totally replaced by clay minerals.\nStages of Fluorite Mineralization\nIn order to determine the relative chronology of mineral deposition in the vein-type fluorite deposits, the Cerros Negros deposit was selected as a case study, due to its excellent outcrops with well defined multiphase sequence of fluorite deposition.\nThe field work was complemented with data and sample profiles that were taken in all the other fluorite veins in the investigated area (Fig. 1). In important mines, such as Bubu, La Estela, Francisco and La Saida, field observations were in general too fragmentary to enable an overview of the complete sequence of mineral deposition, due to poor quality of outcrops. Particularly at the Cerros Negros deposit, the fluorite occurs as open-space filling in a tabular E-W trending tension fracture.\nEleven successive generations of fluorite deposition were identified on the basis of vein chronology, textural relationships and mineralogical data. These fluorite generations can be regrouped into three main mineralizing stages whose spatial arrangements are illustrated in Figure 3. Such arrangements cannot be generalized for all the deposits since deviations of these vein filling patterns frequently occur, including locally at the Cerros Negros, and because in most of the veins some of the fluorite generations, or stages, can be absent.\nStage I, This stage is characterized by deposition of yellow fluorite, followed by white and subordinately pink fluorite. Their texture is mostly massive and coarsely crystalline, and gradually changes to banded, in association with the crystallization of a light blue fluorite.\nStage II. The transition to this stage is marked by fracturing accompanied by deposition of green fluorite (sample 6) and white chalcedony, and formation of tectonic breccias with concentric banded texture around the clasts (cockade texture). Subordinately, the fluorites of\n11.8\nCONIGLIO ET AL.\nstage II are separated by sharp contacts and, by unconformity surfaces from the banded fluorites of stage I. The onset of stage II is characterized by purple, white, violet and green fluorite arranged in a millimeter- to centimeter width crustiform banded texture, with rhythmic variations in color.\nThe end of stage II is marked by a gradual change in the texture from crustiform to colloform and by the local formation of tectonic breccias together with the deposition of dark violet and black fluorite, brown to black chalcedony and pyrite. SEM studies confirmed the presence of coffinite and pitchblende occurring either as inclusions of 2 // m to 10 w m in diameter, or in sharp contact with pyrite (i.e. La Saida Mine).\nStage III. This stage comprises purple and yellow fluorite associated with meter-wide white chalcedony veins, deposited in contact with the granite wall rock or as discordant veinlets within the vein structure. Symmetric crustification, well-developed colloform textures and vugs are typical features of this stage. In the vugs the yellow fluorite is later than the purple one.\nHematite, lepidocrocite and submicroscopic barite were formed by partial oxidation of the pyrite deposited in the previous stage.\nThe fluorite from stages I and II are the principal targets of the present mining activity at the Cerros Negros deposit. The stage HI normally appears very poorly developed or with a low grade of CaF2.\nREE in Fluorite Ores\nREE analyses were performed in fluorite ores by means of neutron activation analysis (INNA) at Instituto de Pesquisas Energ\u00e9ticas e Nucleares (IPEN), S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Two standard reference materials, named GS-N and BE-N, were used. Additionally, the REE contents of granite and hydrothermally altered equivalents (host rocks) were determined by INAA and fusion - inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry method (ICP/MS) respectively, at the Activation Laboratories, Ltd. (Ontario, Canada). Precision was estimated to be within 2 to 3,5 percent for La and Eu, and 5 to 12 percent for Ce, Yb, Nd, Sm, Tb and Lu. REE contents less\nII.9\nthan 0.1 ppm probably are below the analytical accuracy. All the REE data are given in Table 1. They were normalized to REE contents in chondrites according to the data of Evensen et al. (1978).\nThe three fluorite stages previously described can also be distinguished on the basis of chondrite-normalized REE patterns (Fig. 4), La'Yb ratios (Fig. 5) and Eu anomalies (Fig. 6).\nThe stage I fluorite ores exhibits low to intermediate REE contents, ranging from 6.8 ppm to 36.9 ppm, large positive Eu anomaly with lower and constant La/Yb ratios (1.4 - 1.7). Their normalized REE patterns are slightly LREE depleted.\nThe fluorite breccia (sample CN6), which marks the change from stage I to stage n in the mineralized zone, displays the highest REE contents (213.2 ppm), with a marked flat REE patterns, but La/Yb ratio and positive Eu anomaly similar to those of the stage I fluorite ore.\nThe stage II fluorite ores reveal higher REE contents, (17 to 110 ppm) than the previous stage, and patterns of moderate LREE enrichment. Additional features include negative Eu anomaly and higher and variable La/Yb ratios (3.6 - 14.0). The dark fluorite breccia (sample CNL), which marks the transition from the stage II to IH, displays LREE distributions similar to stage II, but the fractionation between the HREE is like that of the stage III fluorite ores. The anomalous contents in some REE elements of sample 9 cannot be accounted for.\nThe stage III fluorite ore is marked by low REE concentrations, ranging from 9.9 ppm to\n10.5\tppm, a small positive Eu anomaly and intermediate La/Yb ratios (2.1 - 2.8), resulting in flat REE patterns, slightly enriched in LREE.\nFigures 4 and 5 show that the variations of the REE distribution in fluorite ores of the three stages was governed by a relatively more fractionated LREE than HREE, the fractionation between the stage I and II being the most marked.\nCONIGLIOETAL\nFluid Inclusion Studies\nFluid inclusion petrography\nFluid inclusions in fluorite from the Cerros Negros deposit are generally abundant and may be separated into primary, pseudosecondary and secondary groups, according to their modes of occurrence in the host crystals using the criteria of Roedder (1984).\nMost of the primary-like inclusions in fluorite occur isolated or as isolated groups in size varying from 10 to 100 pm. The more frequent morphological types include negative crystals, tubular, and irregular to sub-spherical shapes with serrated borders (Figs. 7A and B).\nAs pseudo-secondary type was considered a particular group of inclusion that present sub-spherical shape (&lt;15 pm in diameter) and commonly exhibit oriented arrays along short healed microfractures or fluorite growth planes (Fig. 7C).\nThe secondary inclusions range in size from 10 to 80 pm and generally exhibit very flat and irregular morphologies, i.e. branched shapes, and are concentrated along fractures or (111) cleavage planes (Fig. 7C).\nPrimary, pseudosecondary and secondary inclusions are present in fluorites of the three stages with no great differences in terms of inclusion populations. They consistently contain two phases at room temperature: an aqueous liquid and a vapor phase (bubble). The vapor phase commonly fills approximately 10 to 20% of the bulk volume of the inclusions, implying an originally homogeneous fluid at the time of trapping.\nMicrothermometry\nMicrothermometric measurements in inclusion fluids hosted by fluorite were performed on a heating-freezing stage at the Fluid Inclusion Laboratory of the Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (IG/UNICAMP), Campinas, Brazil. The stage was calibrated using synthetic inclusions containing pure water, manufactured by Syn Flinc. The uncertainly is \u00b1 0,1 \u00b0C for freezing runs, and better than 5\u00b0C for heating runs up to 200 \u00b0C .\nReproducibility in all cases is within the estimated accuracy of the recorded temperature. Control of stretching was made using the criteria of Lawler and Crawford (1983) and Bodnar and Bethke (1984).\nPrimary, pseudosecondary and secondary inclusions were measured by microthermometry but, in order to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of the hydrothermal fluids during the mineralizing stages, only primary and pseudosecondary inclusions were taken into account.\nTotal homogenization temperatures (Tht) on nearly 370 aqueous inclusions were measured in 9 fluorite samples, being 4 of stage I, 3 of the stage II and 2 of the stage III. In these inclusions, the Tht which took place within the range 187\u00b0C - 104\u00b0C, invariably to the liquid phase, may be grouped according to the depositional sequence observed in the field (Fig. 8). A trend of temperature decrease from stage I to in is quite remarkable:\nStage I: median value = 160\u00b0C;\nStage II: median value = 136\u00b0C;\nStage III: median value = 116\u00b0C\nIn these cases, the median values were used since the Tht data present no gaussian distribution.\nBecause of the optical limitations, no microthermometric data were obtained in the dark violet to black uranium bearing fluorite of stage II. However, its does not preclude an estimate of the possible range of its formation temperature because their occurrence is confined to finely banded fluorite and vuggy purple fluorite in stage III, which display Tht of ~136\u00b0C and ~122\u00b0C, respectively. The secondary inclusions have consistently recorded lower Tht than the associated primary ones, generally with values as low as 90 \u00b0C.\nSince the shallow environment of deposition inferred for this type of mineralization, less than 2 km of the paleosurface, (Coniglio, 1993), no pressure correction was applied to the Tht data, and the median values are considered as close estimates of the original trapping temperatures of the inclusion fluids.\nCONIGUOETAL.\nOn the other hand, temperatures of ice melting (150 measurements) display values systematically within the interval of -0,3\u00b0C to +0,4\u00b0C indicating salinity very close to 0 (zero) equivalent weight percent NaCl. This low salinity was observed for all the fluorite ore stages and fluid inclusion types. Inclusions showing positive values for the ice melting (about 20% of the investigated inclusions) were not used for salinity determination, since these values indicate metastability (Roedder, 1984). Further evidence for the metastable behavior of such inclusions is indicated by the occurrence of vapor-free fluid inclusions at room temperature (Fig. 7D) (Shepherd et al., 1985). Carbon dioxide as liquid or other volatiles dissolved in the vapor phase was neither detected by microthermometry (formation of clathatre) nor by Raman microspectroscopy.\nDiscussion\nConstraints on the ore forming fluids\nThe low temperature (187\u00b0C - 104\u00b0C) and the consistently very low salinity of the inclusion fluids in fluorite support a single, uniform fluid reservoir for the ore-forming solutions, probably heated meteoric waters, rather than fluids generated in deep-seated environments within the crust.\nSame characteristics and nature determined for the mineralizing fluids in the fluorite deposits of the Cerro Aspero batholith, have also been reported in several other fluorite districts (Ruiz et al., 1980; Constantopoulos, 1988; Coelho et al, 1990; Bastos Neto et al., 1991).\nAs a contrast, important differences can be noted for the mineralizing fluids in fluorite deposits genetically related to magmatism which show salinities ranging from 9 to 50 equivalent weight percent NaCl and a higher range in the homogenization temperatures (50 - 500 \u00b0C) (Kesler, 1977, Strong et al., 1984, Gunnesch and Jaksch, 1984, Satish Kumar and Santosh, 1994). In addition, the fluorite deposit of Mato Preto, Brazil, whose genesis is partially linked to alkaline magmatism, show a strong variability in the homogenization temperatures (75 - 275\u00b0C) (Ronchi, 1993 in Bastos Neto, et al., 1996).\nFrom this data, the hypothesis that the origin of the fluorite deposits in the Cerro Aspero batholith is related to hydrothermal fluids genetically derived from magmatic activity, ie. Cretaceous alkaline magmatism, is not tenable.\nOn the other hand, the constant degree of fill of the primary and pseudosecondary fluid inclusions populations in the Cerros Negros fluorites indicate that these fluids were homogeneous and no boiling or fluid mixture took place during the mineralizing stages. Furthermore, the absence of boiling suggests that the hydrostatic pressure was always higher than the vapor pressure of the solution (Hass, 1971). Moreover, the well defined trend of progressive cooling of the hydrothermal fluids appears to be one of the most distinctive characteristics of the mineralizing process at Cerros Negros deposit. These evidences allow to infer that the proposed three stage fluorite deposition was probably the result of a single hydrothermal event.\nConstraints on the REE signature of the fluids\nIn an open system condition as inferred for the Cerros Negros deposits, the following factors could be taken into account for the relatively stronger TREE fractionation observed in the fluorite ores:\n(1)\tDifferent sources of the REE. From the comparison of the La/Yb vs Yb distributions between granite host rocks and fluorite ores (Fig. 5), two different REE sources appears to be a possibility. Thus, an REE inherited from LM granite for the fluorite ores of the stage I and a REE inherited from PBM granite for the fluorite ores of the stages II and III can be suggested. Although this hypothesis cannot be totally ruled out, it appears unlikely, since the lack of interaction of the solutions responsible for the deposition of fluorite ores of stage I with the PBM granite, the main host rock of the fluorite deposits, is hard to explain.\n(2)\tFluid-rock interaction. Galindo et al. (1997) pointed out this mechanism as a probable cause for the Nd-Sm and Sr isotopic composition in fluorites from the Achala and Cerro Aspero batholiths, but no further constraints on the mechanisms of REE release to the fluids and\nCONIGLIO ET AL.\nmineralization stages were made. In the present study, field and mineralogical evidences demonstrate that only silicic and argillic alterations were relevant processes during the formation of the fluorite deposits.\nWhereas petrography of the silicic alteration attests that the vein-forming fluids acquired their REE composition from pervasive leaching of the bulk granite mineralogy, but not from any preferential mineral phase, the argillic alteration appears to have been different and more selective, destroying partially the feldspars and biotite of the granite.\nThe comparison of the REE patterns between altered and fresh granite reveals that argillic or silicic alterations had important consequences on the REE mobility (Fig. 9). In the argillic alteration the total REE composition of the granite was relatively unchanged, with the LREE being practically not removed. As a contrast, the silicic alteration resulted in progressive leaching of all the REE, as a function of the increasing intensity of alteration, with strong removal of Eu and preferential leaching of HREE over LREE. These observations can partly be explained by dilution effects caused by the modal increase of quartz, the inability of the secondary minerals to fix all the released REE during alteration, and the extensive leaching effect of the recurring circulation of hydrothermal solutions, which could have been broadly favored by low pH conditions and the presence of fluorine (Rubin et al., 1993).\nIn this context, the more intense leaching of the HREE observed during all the alteration process can be explained because they form stronger complexes with F' than LREE (Taylor and Fryer, 1982). The LREE retention observed in the argillic alteration as against silicic ones can be attributed to the potential of phyllosilicates for LREE adsorption (Aiderton et al., 1980).\nIn summary, this different mobility of the LREE dependent on argillic or silicic alteration strongly suggests that their alternate development (due, for instance, to changes in fluid/rock ratios or pH), could have exerted a significant control on the REE compositions of the hydrothermal solutions.\n(3)\tChemical REE complexation in the fluid. As was previously discussed, the more important HREE mobility that occur during the hydrothermal alteration of the granite attest that the associated fluids are not purely aqueous and the REE could have been transported in solutions mainly as fluoro complexes.\nAt Cerros Negros deposits, the formation of fluorite ores always richer in HREE than LREE, if they are normalized to the host granites, could provide further indirect evidence of the presence of F complexing in the fluids. This observation is in good agreement with the complexes stability constants, which increase from La to Lu (Wood 1990; Moller 1991; Ban and Moller, 1991).\nDespite the fact that REE are very sensitive to transport with Cf, CO32* or OH* (Bau and Moller, 1991), the low salinity and lack of CO2 in the fluid inclusions, together with the absence of carbonates in the ore, and the acidic conditions inferred for the alteration of the host rocks (Coniglio, 1992), indicate that the formation of these complexes was not favored.\nConsidering that several mechanisms could produce fractionation in a fluoro-complexing medium (Bilal et al., 1979; Strong et al., 1984; Moller, 1991; Bau and Moller, 1991), the fractionation of LREE due to chemical complexation during migration process appears to be more likely.\nThe presence of pyrite-coffinite-pitchblende assemblage in the ore suggests that the formation of H2S and probably uranous fluoride complexes in the hydrothermal fluids were other factors that indirectly controlled the REE composition in fluorites from the end of stage II and stage ID. The association of pyrite with pitchblende or coffinite, in the case of a medium saturated with silica, is likely to have formed by the following reaction (Cunningham et al.,1998):\nUO2F3* + FeO (in silicates) + 2 H2S = UO2 + FeS2 + 3F + 2 FT + H2O\nIn this case, the LREE could have been partially extracted to the fluid and concentrated by substituting U4+ in the pitchblende lattice (Leroy and Turpin, 1988).\nCONIGLIOETAL\nOn the basis of these constraints, it is probably realistic to suggest that the REE distribution observed in the Cerros Negros deposits was mainly dependent upon the fluid-rock interaction through which the REE mobility was driven by fluoro complexes.\nEu Anomaly\nAs it was show in figure 9, strong leaching of Eu was produced during the alteration of the host granite, testifying that this element was not depleted in the solution. Hence, variations of the Eu anomalies in fluorite could be readily interpreted in terms of changes in yO2 which controlled the Eu2+/Eu totai ratio (Eu totai= Eu2* + Eu3*) (Meary et al, 1984; Jebrak et al., 1985), assuming fixed values of pH (Sverjensky, 1984). In this context, oxidizing conditions and effective incorporation of EiT in fluorite ores of the stages I and III are inferred from the positive Eu anomalies.\nThe progressive decrease in the Eu anomaly in fluorite ores from highly positive, in stage I, to strongly negative in stage II (Fig 6; Table I), suggests an evolution of mineralizing fluids driven by progressive drops in the fCh. Such a condition could be attained by simple cooling of the hydrothermal fluids (Meary et al., 1984). The resurgence of positive Eu anomalies in fluorites from the stage III was probably produced by increase in /CE. due to the increase in the wSCb 7 mS ' ratio in the fluid, as result of massive precipitation of pyrite.\nConsidering the coexistence of coffinite-pitchblende and pyrite with fluorite ores of the stage II and using thermochemical data (Cunningham et al., 1998), it is possible to infer that the fluids responsible for the deposition of the fluorite had /O2 about IO\"47 to 10\u2019\u00b0\u00b0 bar. Moreover, the formation of hematite, lepidocrocite and barite by oxidation of pyrite suggests that the /O2 probably remained higher than 10'35 bar during the deposition of stage III fluorite.\nFurther considerations on the genetic model\nIn the Cerros Negros deposit evidence for recurrent changes in the alteration style, together with temperature decrease during the fluid evolution, suggest that the precipitation of fluorite was likely driven by fluid-rock interaction combined with simple cooling (Richardson and Holland, 1979).\nIn addition to the cooling trend of the fluids, the changes of the fluorite texture from massive to vuggy from the stage I to in, could be indicating conditions of ore deposition at successively shallower levels below the terrestrial surface, with the present exposure of all three at the same level. In this case, considering that the development of large erosion surfaces in the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba has been assigned as Cretaceous in age (Rabasa et al., 1997), the possibility of erosion during the life of the hydrothermal system cannot be discarded as a viable scenario to account for the process of fluorite deposition.\nAlthough no geochemical data for fluorine distribution in the Cerro Aspero granites are available, several mineralogical phases, other than accessory fluorite, appear as potential sources, particularly, biotite and apatite in view of their modal abundances. This observation is reinforced by the fact that the F contents of the Achala batholith correlate with the abundance of these minerals (Dor\u00e1is et al., 1997).\nFinally, the evidence of coeval deposition between coffinite-pitchblende and fluorite at Cerros Negros deposit indicate that uranium and fluorine are genetically related to the same mineralizing process and strongly suggests a common origin for the mineralization at the Estela deposit.\nCONIGLIO ET AL.\nConclusions\nOn the basis of geological and geochemical data in the fluorite ores and host granite of the Cerro Aspero batholith, it was possible to constrain the evolution of the hydrothermal fluids responsible for the fluorite precipitation.\nThe fluid inclusion study in fluorite of stage I, II and III demonstrate that the trapping fluids had a conspicuous compositional homogeneity and that the distinction of these stages is only possible from the total homogenization temperature. Additionally, the total homogenization temperatures, combined with the Eu/Eu* ratios in fluorite defined a trend of progressive cooling of the hydrothermal fluids from the stage I to IIL\nDespite the uncertainly regarding the mobility and fractionation of REE during hydrothermal alteration (Wood 1990; Lottermoser, 1992), the evidences found in the present work suggest that the mechanism of fluid-rock interaction appear to be the best working model for REE behaviour in the hydrothermal system and fluorite deposition.\nThe genetic link determined for fluorite and uranium minerals raises the question about the age of the fluorite and uranium vein deposits or, alternatively, on the span of time of the mineralizing process, since the uranium deposits in Sierras de Cordoba have been assigned as Tertiary. This consideration and the high U, Th and K contents in the granitic host rocks indicate that the possibility of radiogenic heat supply for hydrothermal fluid convection cannot be discarded. This mechanism was already suggested by Sallet et al. (1996) for the similar fluorite deposits at the Santa Catarina district, Brazil.\nThe fact that some of the fluorite generations, or stages, are absent in several veins in the investigated district, confirm that the mineralized structures had different times of opening and sealing, and thus the depositional sequence established for the Cerros Negros deposits could be used as an effective prospection criteria.\nVEIN-TYPE FLUORITE DEPOSITS\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was performed at the Instituto de Geoci\u00eancias, Universidade Estadual de Campinas (IG/UNICAMP), Brazil, and the research funded by the Secretar\u00eda de Ciencia y T\u00e9cnica, Universidad Nacional de R\u00edo Cuarto (SECYT), Consejo de Investigaciones de C\u00f3rdoba (CONICOR), Argentina, and Coordena\u00e7\u00e3o de Aperfei\u00e7oamento de Pessoal de N\u00edvel Superior (CAPES), Brazil.

A consp\u00edcua presen\u00e7a de texturas bandadas, crustiformes, coloformes e em geodos, entre outras, indica que a fluorita foi depositada em condi\u00e7\u00f5es muito pr\u00f3ximas da superficie.\nA altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal nestes dep\u00f3sitos \u00e9 dominantemente sil\u00edcica e arg\u00edlica, as quais est\u00e3o amplamente limitadas aos sistemas de falhas transcorrentes dentro do biotita monzogranito porfir\u00edtico.\nTr\u00eas est\u00e1gios sucessivos de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o foram distinguidos com base em evid\u00eancias texturais, estudos de inclus\u00f5es fluidas e ETR em fluorita:\nEst\u00e1gio I.- Fluorita maci\u00e7a, depositada principalmente entre 175C\u00b0 e I55C\u00b0, empobrecida em ETRL e com baixo e constante fraccionamento total de ETR (La/Yb= 1,4-1.7).\nEst\u00e1gio II.- Fluorita bandada, depositada principalmente entre 145C\u00b0 e 130C\u00b0, enriquecida em ETRL e relativamente mais fraccionada (La/Yb=3,6-14).\nEst\u00e1gio III.- Fluorita botrioidal e em geodos, depositada principalmente entre 125C\u00b0 e 104C\u00b0 com comportamento de ETR intermedi\u00e1rio entre os dois est\u00e1gios anteriores (La/Yb^2,8~2,1).\nNo dep\u00f3sito Cerros Negros, as inclus\u00f5es fluidas s\u00e3o aquosas bif\u00e1sicas (L>V), apresentam grau de preenchimento constante (0.8-0.9) e homogeneizan ao estado l\u00edquido. Nestas inclus\u00f5es, as temperaturas de fus\u00e3o do gelo no intervalo de -0.3 C\u00b0 \u00e0 +0.4 C\u00b0 indicam salinidade quase nula para o fluido hidrotermal, independentemente do est\u00e1gio de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o. N\u00e3o foram encontradas evid\u00eancias de mistura de fluidos nem ebuli\u00e7\u00e3o.\nA distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos ETR na fluorita \u00e9 principalmente governada pelo fracionamento dos ETR leves. Sugere-se que a composi\u00e7\u00e3o em ETR do fluido hidrotermal e, consequentemente, da fluorita, foram amplamente controlados pela diferente mobilidade dos ETR leves a depender do\nIII.\t1\ntipo de altera\u00e7\u00e3o hidrotermal. Enquanto uma lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o preferencial de ETR pesadas sobre ETR leves ocorreu durante a altera\u00e7\u00e3o sil\u00edcica e arg\u00edlica, nesta \u00faltima, os ETR leves praticamente n\u00e3o foram removidos.\nSe sugere que os ETR foram transportados em solu\u00e7\u00e3o como fluoro-complexos.\nA varia\u00e7\u00e3o na rela\u00e7\u00e3o Eu/Eu* durante a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o do fluido hidrotermal indica mudan\u00e7as na /O2, de condi\u00e7\u00f5es oxidantes para redutoras, o qual foi principalmente originada pelo resfriamento da solu\u00e7\u00e3o.\nOs dados de inclus\u00f5es fluidas sugerem que os tr\u00eas est\u00e1gios de mineraliza\u00e7\u00e3o propostos foram o resultado de um \u00fanico evento hidrotermal e sugerem um reservat\u00f3rio \u00fanico e uniforme para as solu\u00e7\u00f5es mineralizantes, provavelmente \u00e1guas mete\u00f3ricas aquecidas, e n\u00e3o fluidos diretamente derivados da atividade magm\u00e1tica ou gerados em zonas mais profundas da crosta.\nA lixivia\u00e7\u00e3o de fl\u00faor, c\u00e1lcio e ETR das rochas gran\u00edticas pela a\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1guas mete\u00f3ricas aquecidas e consequente deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de fluorita por processos de intera\u00e7\u00e3o fluido - rocha parece ser o melhor modelo de trabalho.\nIV.\tCONSIDERA\u00c7\u00d5ES FINAIS\nEste trabalho faz parte de uma das linhas de pesquisa que a UNRC t\u00eam priorizada num dos seus projetos de desenvolvimento cient\u00edfico - tecnol\u00f3gico e na sua pol\u00edtica de inser\u00e7\u00e3o regional.\nOs resultados deste estudo t\u00eam dois pontos fundamentais de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o:\n-\tQuanto ao plano da Geologia Econ\u00f4mica, os aportes efetuados ao conhecimento do modelo gen\u00e9tico poderiam ser utilizados para uma melhor programa\u00e7\u00e3o das tarefas de prospe\u00e7\u00e3o e explora\u00e7\u00e3o dos fil\u00f5es de fluorita no bat\u00f3lito Cerro Aspero. Adicionalmente, tamb\u00e9m se espera que possa ser aplicado como modelo comparativo em outras \u00e1reas, particularmente no ambiente geol\u00f3gico das Sierras Pampeanas.\n-\tNo que se refere aos aspetos ambientais, os altos conte\u00fados de fl\u00faor nas \u00e1guas subterr\u00e2neas da zona de plan\u00edcie circunvizinha com este setor das Serras de C\u00f3rdoba, \u00e9 um problema que afeta o consumo de \u00e1gua de mais de 150.000 habitantes. O conhecimento sobre as poss\u00edveis \u00e1reas e fontes de aporte de fl\u00faor nas \u00e1guas, assim como o estudo dos aspetos relacionados \u00e1 hidrogeoqu\u00edmica do fl\u00faor no ambiente de intemperismo, est\u00e1 abrindo um campo promissor de pesquisa multidisciplinar.\nIV. 1\nV.\tREFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS\nV.
