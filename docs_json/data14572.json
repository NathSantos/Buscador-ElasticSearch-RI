Na\ncosta central portuguesa, a pluma do Estu\u00e1rio do Tejo influencia a hidrografia da regi\u00e3o,\ncontrolando a din\u00e2mica local. Na atualidade, estudos de plumas estuarinas s\u00e3o realizados\nutilizando modelos de circula\u00e7\u00e3o e de transporte de alta-resolu\u00e7\u00e3o e sofisticados m\u00e9todos\nde an\u00e1lise de dados, como as redes neuronais. O objetivo deste estudo consiste em analisar\nos padr\u00f5es da descarga estuarina do Tejo na zona costeira adjacente, sob diferentes\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es de vento e eventos de descarga estuarinas elevadas.\n\nNeste \u00e2mbito, implementou-se o modelo 3D de circula\u00e7\u00e3o e transporte MOHID, utilizando\num m\u00e9todo de downscaling do modelo Operational Model for the Portuguese Coast\n(PCOMS) (6 km) para a ROFI do Estu\u00e1rio do Tejo (500m). De modo a melhorar\nos for\u00e7amentos atmosf\u00e9ricos do modelo costeiro, implementou-se uma nova aplica\u00e7\u00e3o\nde alta-resolu\u00e7\u00e3o (2 km) do modelo WRF para a regi\u00e3o. A valida\u00e7\u00e3o dos modelos de\ncircula\u00e7\u00e3o e de transporte foram realizadas para o per\u00edodo de Julho a Dezembro de 2012.\nResultados num\u00e9ricos demonstram uma reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o correta dos padr\u00f5es superficiais\nquando comparados com dados observados de velocidade da corrente, salinidade e\ntemperatura da \u00e1gua. O erro m\u00e9dio quadr\u00e1tico (RMSE) das correntes de superf\u00edcie\nmostrou um desvio m\u00e9dio inferior a 16 cms?1. Compara\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura superficial\nda agua com os dados remotos do sensor MODIS-Aqua identificaram um desvio inferior\na 2oC, demostrando a qualidade das previs\u00f5es do modelo em reproduzir os padr\u00f5es\ndin\u00e2micos costeiros.\n\nDe modo a estudar a variabilidade costeira causada pela descarga estuarina do Tejo,\nsimularam-se 5 cen\u00e1rios utilizando ventos favor\u00e1veis de upwelling e downwelling, e\ndescargas do Rio Tejo de 1500, 3000 e 5000 m3s?1. As simula\u00e7\u00f5es dos cen\u00e1rios foram\nrealizadas para o per\u00edodo de 8-31 de Novembro de 2012, devido \u00e0 ocorr\u00eancia de padr\u00f5es\nfavor\u00e1veis de vento. Com o objetivo de quantificar a variabilidade costeira, realizou-se\numa analise SOM com 1x4 padr\u00f5es espaciais dos campos de salinidade \u00e0 superf\u00edcie. Os\nresultados demonstram que as descargas fluviais s\u00e3o o principal for\u00e7amento nas simula\u00e7\u00f5es,\ns\u00f3 superados pelo vento aquando se registam baixas descarga fluviais. Sec\u00e7\u00f5es transversais\nda salinidade mostraram uma profundidade da pluma estuarina com cerca de 15 m na\nzona da embocadura do estu\u00e1rio, reduzindo-se para 10 m na zona costeira adjacente\nao Cabo da Roca. A tens\u00e3o do vento revelou ter um papel importante na dispers\u00e3o da\npluma, sendo respons\u00e1vel pelo transporte para norte ou para sudoeste da mesma. Em\ntodos os cen\u00e1rios, os ventos favor\u00e1veis a downwelling transportam a pluma para norte\nencostada \u00e0 costa, enquanto ventos de upwelling transportam a pluma para sudoeste.\n\nA nova implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de alta resolu\u00e7\u00e3o em 3D desenvolvida neste trabalho permite\nretirar informa\u00e7\u00e3o extra acerca da din\u00e2mica da pluma estuarina sob diferentes condi\u00e7\u00f5es\nde vento e descarga do Rio Tejo. Padr\u00f5es distintos de dispers\u00e3o foram observados,\npermitindo uma melhoria do conhecimento da circula\u00e7\u00e3o e hidrografia da regi\u00e3o. Para\ntrabalhos futuros, este modelo pode permitir o acoplamento de modelos biogeoqu\u00edmicos\nou de derrame de hidrocarbonetos, temas importantes e desafiantes para a complexa\nzona costeira adjacente ao Estu\u00e1rio do Tejo.\n\n\n\n\n\nkeywords\nTagus estuary, hydrodynamic model, estuarine plume, MOHID, SOM, MODIS\n\nabstract\nBuoyant discharges from estuaries form an outflow plume that is advected onto the near\nshelf during the ebb tide, modulating the circulation and hydrography of the adjacent\ncoast. In the central coast of Portugal, the plume from the Tagus Estuary influences\nthe hydrography of the area, controlling local dynamics. Nowadays, estuarine plume\npropagation studies are performed using high-resolution circulation and transport models\nand sophisticated data analyses tools, as the artificial neural networks. The main aim\nof this work consists in studying the Tagus Estuarine outflow behaviour under different\nwind forcing conditions and variable river discharge events.\n\nFor this purpose, a 3D circulation and transport model (www.mohid.com) was imple-\nmented for the region, using a nested downscaling approach from the Operational Model\nfor the Portuguese Coast (PCOMS) (6 km) to the Tagus ROFI (500 m). To improve\nthe atmospheric circulation model forcing, a new high-resolution atmospheric model (2\nkm) was implemented for the region, using the WRF model. To validate the circulation\nand transport models, a simulation period between July and December 2012 was used.\nNumerical predictions shown an accurate reproduction of the surface patterns when\ncompared with observed data of current velocity, salinity and water temperature. The\nroot mean square error (RMSE) of surface currents revealed a mean deviation lower\nthan 16 cm s?1. SST comparison with MODIS-Aqua remote sensing imagery shows a\ndeviation lower than 2oC, revealing the model accuracy in reproducing coastal dynamics.\n\nIn order to study coastal variability due to the Tagus estuarine outflow, five scenarios were\nsimulated under upwelling and downwelling favourable winds and Tagus river discharge\nof 1500, 3000 and 5000 m3s?1. The scenarios simulations were performed for the days\n8-31 of November 2012 because of favourable distinct wind patterns. In order to quantify\nthe region variability 1\u00d74 Self-Organizing Map (SOM) of the surface salinity fields were\nperformed. The results show that river discharge is the main controlling forcing for the\nscenarios simulation, only overtaken by the wind, when low discharge values were present.\nThe cross-shelf sections show a depth of the plume bulge of 15 m near the mouth of\nthe estuary, reducing to 10 m in the far region, near Cabo da Roca. The wind stress\nplayed a powerful role in the dispersion of the bulge, being responsible for the north or\nsouthwest transport of the plume. In all scenarios, under downwelling favourable winds\nthe plume is compressed toward the coast, and under upwelling winds the plume follows\na SW direction, being advected offshore.\n\nThe new high resolution 3D implementation developed in this study provides extra\ninformation about the Tejo estuarine plume dynamic under different conditions of winds\nand river discharge. Distinct spatial dispersion was observed improving the knowledge of\nthe region circulation and hydrography. Thus, this validated implementation can be used\nfor new studies, such as coupling of a biogeochemistry or oil spill models, topics that\nare important and challenging for a complex coastal region such as the off the Tagus\nEstuary.\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nContents i\n\nList of Figures iii\n\nList of Tables v\n\nList of Acronyms vii\n\n1 Introduction 1\n1.1 Motivation and aims . . . . . . . . .

Both forcings are very much influenced by natural and anthropogenic\nfactors, being crucial to analyse the joint influences.\n\nIn general, in studies of coastal processes, estuarine regions are not included, since\nestuaries and near coastal regions are preferentially treated separately because of spatial\nresolution needed to represent local physical processes (Otero et al., 2008; Oliveira et al.,\n2009). Estuaries are usually related with zones of high primary productivity, nurseries for\nfish species, sheltering for vessels and harbour industries. These characteristics contributes\nto a population increase around estuaries borders that can increase the anthropogenic\nstress.\n\nUsually, the impact of estuaries in the coastal region is in the form of a buoyant plume,\nthat affects circulation and transport of soluble and particulate materials to the near coast.\nThese plumes are dynamical structures resulting from the discharge of low salinity water\nover a heavier (denser) ambient (Kourafalou et al., 1996). The plumes can change physical,\nchemical and biological features of those regions and also effect the transport of soluble\nand suspended materials that can lead to an increase in coastal primary production (Sousa\net al., 2013).\n\nThe pressure caused by anthropogenic factor in estuaries and coastal systems may\nturn these regions into vulnerable systems, requesting frequent monitorization and damage\ncontrol.\n\nThe central region of Portugal, comprising the Tagus Estuarine region, is influenced by\n\n1\n\n\n\n2 Introduction\n\nnumerous storms which can impact coastal systems due to strong winds and considerable\namount of precipitation, promoting changes in circulation and hydrography.\n\nAnother forcing that affects estuarine and coastal dynamics is the freshwater discharge,\nwhich is quiet important once the Tagus river drains one of the largest watershed areas\nof the Iberian Peninsula, retaining a huge amount of precipitable water able to produce\nhigh river discharge. That can have a major impact in the estuary (Vaz and Dias, 2014).\nMoreover, according to Dagg et al. (2004) river outflows can be related with the plume\nextension in the near coastal region.\n\nAnother forcing that influences estuarine and coastal circulation is the wind intensity\nand direction. In fact, the typical wind pattern in the Portuguese west coast, during the\nsummer, is from the north. These winds are commonly referred as upwelling favourable,\nsince they promote an offshore advection of surface waters and a vertical advection of rich\nnutrient upwelled waters toward the surface. During these upwelling events an increase in\nprimary productivity can be observed (Vaz et al., 2015).\n\nSeveral studies have been performed regarding the Tagus estuary dynamics. Nevertheless\nthere are not many studies regarding the adjacent coastal region circulation. Only a few\nstudies have been performed for the near coastal region of the Tagus Estuary. In fact,\nFortunato et al. (1999) and Vaz et al. (2009b, 2011, 2015) studied the region close to the\nestuary mouth, highlighting topics as the mouth hydrodynamics, coastal circulation and\nsurface sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll patterns.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to highlight the main features of the Tagus estuarine\nplume under different wind stress and freshwater discharge conditions in order to increase\nthe knowledge of the impact of the large estuarine discharge in the hydrography and\ncirculation of the region. To achieve these goals, a nested implementation of an high\nresolution circulation model (based on MOHID) is used. Also, a recent methodology to\ncompute the main variability is also used, the self-organizing maps (SOM) method. Merged\nwith the main objective, there are important steps for model validation using different\ndatasets, such as: sea surface elevation (SSE) from tide gauge, surface current validation\nusing Sistema de Monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o Operacional de Correntes Costeiras (SIMOC) and Moderate\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data.\n\n\n\n1.2. Literature review 3\n\n1.2 Literature review\n\n1.2.1 Estuarine plumes\n\nEstuarine plumes impact in the coastal ocean in the form of a buoyant plume that\ntransports land and rainfall materials from the river discharge. From the dynamical point of\nview, the discharge area of rivers in the coast can be considered as an input of momentum\nand buoyancy caused by the release of a less dense fluid (river discharge) into a heavier fluid\n(coastal waters). This structure is known as buoyant river plume (Kourafalou et al., 1996).\n\nThus structures are vital for the transport of sediments, nutrients and organic mater\nfrom estuaries to the near coast, playing an important role in their transport.\n\nThe main characteristics of these plumes have been studied since the early 50\u2019s of the XX\ncentury using numerical model applications. One of the first studies were realized by Takano\n(1954a,b, 1955) using an idealized model with a straight coast. In the following years the\nimpact of diverse river plumes was analyzed using numerical model applications: as examples\nare the Columbia River Estuary (USA) (Stefnsson and Richards, 1963), Chesapeake Bay\n(USA) (Boicourt, 1973) and the Connecticut River Estuary (USA) (Garvine, 1974).\n\nThe characterization of the plume anatomy was studied, firstly, by Garvine (1982). The\nauthor split the surface plume in three regions: source, near-field and far-field plume. These\nregions have distinct characteristics and also different impact in the transport of soluble and\ndissolved materials. More recently, Horner-Devine et al. (2009) have proposed an alteration\nto the previous classification, decomposing the near-field plume in pulse, tidal plume and\nresidual re-circulating plume.\n\nAlso, the influence of submarine canyons in plume outflow was studied by Weaver and\nHsieh (1987). Here the authors observed that in the presence of a canyon near the estuary\nmouth, the joint effect of baroclinicity and relief provides a strong forcing term for the\nbarotropic flow, resulting in an along shelf propagation of the plume where is observed an\nincrease of the energy; following the previous study, Chao (1988) has concluded that the\nexistence of a shelf slope reduces the seaward excursion of the plume bulge.\n\nThe influence of the estuarine outflow in the adjacent coastal shelf was also identified\nby Yankovsky (2000). In this work, the role of the outflow channel shape and the width-to-\ndepth ratio of the estuary mouth was observed, revealing an important role in dynamics of\nthe plume.\n\nKourafalou et al. (1996) identified the plumes structure for different wind stress scenarios,\nand they have found that during favourable downwelling wind, the plume enhanced the effect\n\n\n\n4 Introduction\n\nof the coastal current in the region, confining the buoyancy close to the coast. Conversely,\nfavourable upwelling winds produce a larger offshore plume propagation (or expansion).\nThe same conclusion was obtained by Hickey et al. (1998), Fong and Geyer (2001) and\nFong and Geyer (2002) in their studies.\n\nDuring the last decade, the plume dynamics of several Portuguese estuaries has been\nstudied. In 2010, Mendes had implemented a circulation and transport model for the Ria\nde Aveiro Lagoon, classifying it as near-field and surface-advected plume, according to the\nHetland (2005) proposed methodology. Sousa et al. (2014a,b) evaluated the influence of\nthe Minho river in the Rias Baixas (NW Spain) hydrography using different wind pattern\nand river discharge scenarios. Those authors concluded that under northward wind, the\nMinho river plume can reach Ria de Pontevedra (Spain).\n\nFor the adjacent area of the Tagus estuary there are a few studies about plumes\npropagation and characteristics. One of the first analysis of the plume propagation behaviour\nwas realized by Vaz et al. (2009b). These authors studied the estuarine plume propagation\nbased on a nested 3D baroclinic model with 35 vertical layers highlighting the impact of\nthe Tagus Estuarine plume in the coast. Offshore Ekman transport induced by southward\nwinds produces a maximum displacement of the plume water of about 40 km offshore. Also,\nValente and da Silva (2009) have studied the turbid signal in the Tagus Estuary mouth\nusing a 3 year sequence of MODIS-Aqua nLw551 satellite product, concluding that the\nplume has a fortnightly scale variation, presenting small dimensions after neap tides and\nhigher dimensions after spring tides. The dimension of the turbid area can increase with\nriver discharge and winds which are consistent with the results obtained by Mendes et al.\n(2014) for the Douro river plume, where was not observed an evidence of an existing plume\nfor river flow lower than 148 m3s?1.\n\nMore recently, Vaz et al. (2015) reveal the impact of Tagus estuary plume in adjacent\ncoastal waters properties, such as, water temperature, salinity and chlorophyll concentration.\nIn their study, the authors propose as future work, the implementation of better atmospheric\nforcing, justified by the existence of topographic features, such as Serra de Sintra, which\ncan influence the impact of the Tagus estuarine plume in the circulation and hydrography\nof the adjacent coast.\n\n\n\n1.2. Literature review 5\n\n1.2.2 Circulation model - MOHID\n\nThe use of circulation models brings a strong forecasting and hindcasting capability\nto the study of coastal and estuarine areas. One of those models is the numerical model\nWater Modelling System (MOHID), a 3D baroclinic finite volume marine model designed\nfor the study of estuarine and coastal regions. This model uses several modules to compute\ncirculation, water properties transport and biogeochemical features of estuarine and coastal\nsystems, being possible the addition of new ones, once that the model is an open source\ncode.\n\nMOHID is used in many different systems, presenting a large versatility. As examples,\nGomez-Gesteira et al. (1999) evaluated the residence time of the NW region of Spain,\ntaking advantage of the particle tracking module. Saraiva et al. (2007) have used MOHID\nto investigate the impact of nutrients loads in the main Portuguese estuaries, while Sousa\net al. (2013) evaluated the Minho river plume dynamic and its influence in the Rias Baixas.\n\nThe Ria de Aveiro lagoon has been also studied during the last years thought the\napplication of MOHID. In fact, studies focused on circulation (Vaz et al., 2007; Picado\net al., 2013) and transport of properties (Vaz et al., 2009a; Mendes, 2010) were performed in\norder to fully characteriz the lagoon\u2019s hydrodynamics. The impact of bathymetric changes\nin the Lima estuary hydrodynamic were investigate by Rodrigues et al. (2012) using also\nMOHID.\n\nMoreover, the hydrodynamic of the Tagus Estuary has been studied through numer-\nical experiments based on MOHID applications. Leit\u00e3o et al. (2000) implemented a 3D\napplication for the Tagus region of fresh water influence in which, the authors observed\nthe influence of Serra de Sintra in the rotation of the wind field capable of generate strong\nbarotropic currents. Fernandes (2005) implemented an operational application for the Tagus\nEstuary and Vaz et al. (2009b) take one first step on the characterization of the Tagus\nestuarine plume. In the following years several circulation and water transport studies were\nperformed in order to highlight the estuarine and coastal features of the system, evaluating\naspects as the tidal propagation, residual circulation and cohesive sediments dynamics (Vaz\net al., 2011; Dias et al., 2013; Vaz and Dias, 2014; Franz et al., 2014). One recent work\nstudies the SST and chlorophyll in the adjacent region of the estuary (Vaz et al., 2015).\n\nThis model was also used to study the hydrodynamics and transport process at other\nestuarine system. In fact, Coelho et al. (2000) conducted a circulation and water transport\nstudy in Guadiana Estuary, where they concluded that with river discharger higher then\n1000 m3 s?1 fulfil the entire estuary with fresh water. A Sado Estuary implementation of\n\n\n\n6 Introduction\n\nMOHID was performed by Martins et al. (2001) using a generic vertical discretization to\nhighlight estuarine dynamics in the system. A 3D implementations for the Lagoon of Ria\nFormosa was performed by Silva et al. (2002) aiming to understand the Faro-Olh\u00e3o inlet\nprocesses. The effect of coastal waves on sea level inside Ob\u00eddos Lagoon was assessed by\nMalhadas et al. (2009), where results showed that lagoon sea level remains above offshore\nsea level during storm wave periods.\n\nThe versatility of MOHID system allows the necessary conditions to be used as a\noperational model. In fact, the Technical University of Lisbon (UTL) used the Portuguese\nCoast Operational Modelling System (PCOMS) based on MOHID application, that covers\nall the continental Portuguese territory to produce daily forecast of coastal circulation,\nhydrography and biogeochemistry (oxygen, chlorophyll and nutrients) maps (Mateus et al.,\n2012).\n\n1.2.3 Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)\n\nCoupled ocean-atmosphere datasets from observations and numerical model output are\nsteadily increasing the amount of available data to produce estuarine and coastal studies\n(Liu and Weisberg, 2005). Petrou (2004) estimates that less of 5% of all remote sensing\nimages are ever seen or used by the scientific community. Therefore, new pattern detection\ntechniques have been developed to analyse those datasets.\n\nThe non-linearity of ocean and atmospherics dynamic make the pattern recognition\nharder and challenging. One of those new techniques is the Self-Organizing Map (SOM),\nan unsupervised neural network based on competitive learning (Kohonen, 1988; Vesanto\net al., 2000). To demonstrate the SOM capability, Liu et al. (2006b) have performed a\ncomparative test using the sum of a sinusoidal wave and concluded that SOM successfully\nidentified all the input wave periods. Futher studies by Liu and Weisberg (2007) concluded\nthat the SOM patterns were more intuitive and accurate than the principal mode of the\nEmpirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) method.\n\nSOM algorithm implementation in climatology field began in the late 1990s, using\ndaily sea level pressure data to identify atmospheric circulation patterns (Hewitson and\nCrane, 2002), sea level patterns over North Atlantic Region (Schuenemann and Cassano,\n2010) and air temperature and humidity spatial variability (Reusch et al., 2005). Also,\nKropp and Klenke (1997) have used SOM for the analysis of 170 sediments samples with\ndifferent biological and geochemical conditions, concluding that SOM managed to shrink a\n11-dimensional data manifold into a 2-dimensional subspace preserving all relevant features\n\n\n\n1.3. Structure of this work 7\n\nof the data set.\nRichardson et al. (2003) and Risien (2004) retrieve surface pattern currents and variability\n\nof the Benguela upwelling region (Southeaster Atlantic), while Cheng and Wilson (2006)\nused SOM to identify vertical pattern of currents for the Hudson River estuary (USA) using\n233 day Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) segments.\n\nLiu and Weisberg (2005) and Liu et al. (2006a,b, 2007) have characterized the West\nFlorida Shelf region (USA) using different datasets (SST, High-Frequency (HF) radar and\nADCP). Liu et al. (2009) used a 3D model dataset, for the region of Columbia River (USA),\nto identify the pattern of estuarine plume, highlighting its bi-directional propagation. The\nauthors observed the influence of wind on the plume dimension, with a smaller bulge under\ndownwelling wind events and larger bulges under upwelling wind events.\n\n1.3 Structure of this work\n\nConcerning the structure of this dissertation it was divided in five chapters. Chapter 1\npresents a description of the main objectives and a literature review of relevant aspects to\nthe study. In Chapter 2, a detailed description of the study region, giving special focus\nto the adjacent coastal area of Tagus estuary, is performed. In Chapter 3, the numerical\nmodel implementation and methodology followed during thesis are described.\n\nThe results and discussion of the validation and scenarios results are presented in\nChapter 4. Finally, in Chapter 5 an overview of the results, presenting final conclusions\nand providing some future research suggestions is made.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nStudy Region\n\nThe study region is located on the Portuguese central west coast between 38.0?N and\n39.5?N, and comprises the Tagus Estuary and the near coastal ocean (Figure 2.1). This\nregion is located in a highly populated region, subject to an enormous natural and human\nstress. The topography of the adjacent region of Tagus estuary is considered relatively flat,\nwith the 200 m isobath located roughly at 30 km offshore of Tagus estuary mouth. However\nthe area comprises a complex bathymetry, constituted by three submarine canyons: the\n\nFigure 2.1: The study area comprising the Tagus Estuary and the adjacent shelf region.\nWhite lines represent isobaths of 200, 1000, 3000 and 4000 m. Red lines depicts the Setubal\n(SC), Lisbon (LC) and Nazar\u00e9 canyons (NC) locations. Blue circle represent QuickScat\nlocation and white triangle the EMG.\n\n9\n\n\n\n10 Study Region\n\nNazar\u00e9, the Lisbon and the Setubal canyons. These canyons extend beyond the 10?N with\nmore than 2000 m depth.\n\nThe wind regime in the region is strongly influenced by the Azores high-pressure system.\nThe pressure difference between the centre of Azores high-pressure and Portugal varies\nfrom 1 mbar in winter to 8 mbar in the Summer. This gradient is responsible by the rise of\nstrong north/north-westerly winds, affecting the region (Fi\u00faza et al., 1982).\n\nIn this region, wind-driven upwelling occurs when equatorward winds induce net offshore\nEkman surface transport, resulting in a divergence of nearshore transport, conversely\nfavourable downwelling winds induce an Ekman surface transport toward the coastal region\n(Fi\u00faza et al., 1982; Silva, 2008).\n\nIn adition to the wind effect on coastal currents, the Portuguese west coast presents an\ngenerally equatorward flow, known as the Portuguese Current (PC). PC is characterized\nas an upper circulation flow with little seasonality that extends from the 10oW to about\n24oW (Maillard, 1986). In the continental shelf, during autumn and early winter, a\nnorth poleward flow (near the 200 m depth) is observed. This is known as the Portugal\nCoastal Counter Current (PCCC) (Ambar and Fi\u00faza, 1994). This flow results from the\ngeostrophic adjustment of weak eastward oceanic flow, driven by the large-scale meridional\nbaroclinic pressure gradient (Frouin et al., 1990; P\u00e9rez et al., 2001). During the upwelling\nseason, PCCC fades because of the northerly winds, giving place to the Portugal Coastal\nCurrent (PCC). Both currents are typically located in a narrow band between 10 ? 11oW\n(P\u00e9rez et al., 2001). All these coastal currents may act to change the propagation pattern of\nthe Tagus estuarine plume, since they can intensify (or de-intensify) the wind and estuarine\ndischarge currents.\n\nAccording to Mason et al. (2005), the main water source of the upper layers (>300 m)\nof the West Iberian coastal waters is the Eastern North Atlantic Central Water sub tropical\nbranch (ENACWst). During upwelling events, ENACWst is the main source of the advected\nwater south of Nazar\u00e9 canyon and, according to R\u00edos et al. (1992) the main observed water\nsource in the Lisbon bay.\n\n2.1 Tagus Estuary\n\nEstuarine circulation and exchange processes are forced by tide, freshwater discharges\nand atmospheric conditions. It is fundamental to assess the circulation and hydrographic\ncharacteristics of the estuary, once that these will have a direct role on the estuarine-coastal\n\n\n\n2.1. Tagus Estuary 11\n\nexchange.\nThe Tagus Estuary covers an area of about 320 km2 of which 40% are tidal flats (Silva,\n\n2012). It is the largest estuary of the Iberian Peninsula and one of the most extensive\nwetlands in Portugal (Dias, 1993). On its shores is located the highest population density\nzone of Portugal, the metropolitan region of Lisbon (Figure 2.2).\n\nThe estuary has a pear-shape with roughly 30 km long and can be morphologically split\nin three distinct zones (Rusu et al., 2009; Neves, 2010):\n\n\u2022 An upstream area with low average depth (? 2 m), presenting large intertidal zones.\nHere, the connection with the river is made through a channel with an average width\nof 200 m (location in 38.86oN, 9.03oW );\n\n\u2022 The Central area (known as Mar da Palha) with an average depth of 7 m. This zone\nis the largest of the estuary, reaching 15 km wide. In this zone freshwater is mixed\nwith the ocean water (located between 38.65oN, 9.12oW and 38.86oN, 9.03oW );\n\n\u2022 The inlet channel or corridor (known as corredor) has 15 km length and is 2 km wide\nand present the deepest area of the estuary, with a maximum depth of about 40 m.\nThis region is the connection with the ocean and presents the faster flow, over 2 ms?1\n\n(Vaz et al., 2011) . The mouth of the estuary is usually considered the section S\u00e3o\nJuli\u00e3o da Barra - Bugio.\n\nFigure 2.2: Tagus Estuary region.\n\n\n\n12 Study Region\n\nThe estuary hydrography is mainly controlled by the tidal propagation and fluvial\ndischarge (Vaz et al., 2011). The estuary is mesotidal, with a typical neap tide of 0.8 m and\nspring tide of 4.0 m (Fortunato et al., 1997). The tide has a dominant role in the estuary\ndynamics, since the tidal prism is on the order of 600 \u00d7 106 m3 in comparison with the\n8.2 \u00d7 106 m3 of river flow per tidal cycle (Neves, 2010).\n\nAccording to Fortunato et al. (1999), floods take normally one hour more in comparison\nto ebb, leading to a dominant ebb flow. This ebb dominance results in higher current\nvelocities during ebb, reaching 2 ms?1 in spring tides (Portela, 1996; Vaz and Dias, 2014).\n\n2.1.1 River discharge\n\nThe main freshwater tributary of the estuary is the Tagus river. The river rises in Serra\nde Albarracin (Spain) and travels around 1000 km before discharging in the Atlantic Ocean\nnear Lisbon. In its route, drains a basin which is the second largest of Iberian Peninsula\nreaching almost 81 000 km2, of which 30% are in Portuguese territory (Vis et al., 2010).\n\nThe Tagus river discharge usually presents pronounced annual and inter-annual variations\n(Vale and Sundby, 1987). The discharge regime becomes modulated after the 50\u2019s decade\nof the XX century after the building of several dams in the Tagus river basin (Macedo,\n2006). The annual average discharge of Tagus river is between 300-400 m3s?1 (Macedo,\n2006; Neves, 2010; Vaz et al., 2011) but monthly averages can vary between 1 m3s?1 and\n2200 m3s?1 (Loureiro, 1979). The estuarine freshwater budget is controlled by the inflow of\nthree main rivers (Tagus, Sorraia and Tranc\u00e3o rivers). A statistical analysis for these rivers\ninflow was performed using daily river discharge data available from Ag\u00eancia Portuguesa\ndo Ambiente (APA) website (snirh.pt). The Tagus river analysis was performed using data\nfrom the the \u00d3mnias station (18E/04H) for a period ranging between 1978 and 2001. For\nthis period an average discharge of 335 m3s?1 was observed.\n\nThe other two rivers (Sorraia and Tranc\u00e3o) display a lower average annual discharge,\nwhen compared to the Tagus River (Figure 2.3a). As for both rivers there are no monitoring\nstations available near the connection with the Tagus estuary, were considered the nearest\nmeasuring stations to the discharge point. For the Sorraia River, data from the stations of\nthe Ponte de Coruche (20F/02H) and Ponte de S\u00e3o Estev\u00e3o (20E/02H) were used, for the\nperiod of 1976-1980. The same approach was implemented for the Tranc\u00e3o River, using the\nstations of Ponte Canas (20C/01H) and Ponte Pinhal (21C/01H), for a period between the\nyears of 1979 and 1989. From the data analysis annual river discharges of 39.3 m3s?1 and\n1.7 m3s?1 for Sorraia and Tranc\u00e3o rivers, respectively. These values are consistent with\n\n\n\n2.1. Tagus Estuary 13\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.3: (a) monthly mean rivers discharge values of (A) Tagus, (B) Sorraia and (C)\nTranc\u00e3o rivers, calculated from daily discharge values. (b) the sum of rivers discharges to\nthe estuary.\n\nthose found by Fortunato et al. (1999) (with 35 and 2.5 m3s?1, respectively).\nFrom Figure 2.3b a strong seasonality on total freshwater discharge to the estuary is\n\nobservable, with higher values registered during the winter period. On the other hand,\nduring the summer the freshwater discharge is considerable low. The statistical analysis of\nfreshwater discharge in the estuary reveals that the Tagus River contributes with 80% of\nthe total inflow, leaving 19% to the Sorraia River and less than 1% to the Tranc\u00e3o River.\n\nIn Tagus River, during winter, 5% of the discharge observations are lower than 44 m3s?1\n\nor higher then 1875 m3s?1, showing high variability (Table 2.1). In Summer, the variability\nis lower, with 5% of observations below 14 m3s?1 or over 340 m3s?1.\n\nTable 2.1: Daily Tagus river discharge percentiles for the period 1978-2001.\n\nPercentiles Winterm3s?1\nSpring\nm3s?1\n\nSummer\nm3s?1\n\nAutumn\nm3s?1\n\n5 44 28 14 17\n50 302 156 102 150\n95 1875 930 340 801\n\n\n\n14 Study Region\n\n2.2 Wind influence\n\nThe influence of the wind stress on ocean surface circulation and hydrography has\nbeen largely observed on plumes and other oceanographic features (Sousa, 2013). For\nthe study region, upwelling regimes are highly dependent of the northern wind stress\ncomponent (Vaz et al., 2009b). Therefore, the use of inaccurate surface wind intensity\nand direction, as atmospheric forcing may modify the circulation model results. Thus, an\naccurate reproduction of wind patterns is a key point for numerical model applications,\nespecially for a study region characterized by its large spatial variability. To illustrate this,\nthree wind roses generated with data for the full years of 2004-2008 at three locations\n(Figure 2.4), located 50 km apart of each other, are presented in Figure 2.5.\n\nThe QuickScat data corresponds to daily remote sensing wind sensor observations.\nThese data show a predominance of winds from N and NNW, with 19.6% and 16.7% of\noccurrence, respectively (Figure 2.5a). Regarding the Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Meteorol\u00f3gica da Guia (EMG)\nstation, representative of the Tagus estuary mouth, a N (17.0%) and NNE (16.4%) wind\npredominance for the same period was observed (Figure 2.5b). Finally, the station near\nthe Lisbon airport shows a NW/NNW predominance with 18.5% and 18.2%, respectively\n(Figure 2.5c).\n\nThese results suggest a strong spatial wind variability in the study region, both in terms\nof wind intensity and direction. The presence of the Serra de Sintra, 20 km north of EMG,\nthat might be the reason for the rotation of dominant winds and intensity changes. These\n\nFigure 2.4: Location of the wind comparison points.\n\n\n\n2.2. Wind influence 15\n\n(a) QuickScat sensor. (b) EMG station.

Since then, MOHID has suffered signif-\nicant advances, such as: three-dimensional capacity (Santos, 1995), lagrangian transport\nmodule (Leit\u00e3o, 1996) and water quality modules (Miranda, 1997).\n\nOne important feature of MOHID is the ability to simulate estuarine environments (Vaz\net al., 2007; Malhadas et al., 2009; Franz et al., 2014; Vaz and Dias, 2014; Vaz et al., 2015),\nand also, large scale circulation (Leit\u00e3o et al., 2005; Vaz et al., 2009b; Sousa et al., 2014a,b).\nTo accomplish the objectives of this work two model applications were implemented: one\nfor the estuarine area and other for the coastal adjacent area.\n\n3.1.1 Physical descritization\n\nMOHID solves the three-dimensional incompressible primitive equations assuming\nhydrostatic equilibrium and the Boussinesq and Reynolds approximations. The primitive\n\n17\n\n\n\n18 Numerical Models and Methodology\n\nequations are solved in Cartesian coordinates for incompressible flows. The following\nequations have been derived taking into account these approximations and more details\ncan be obtained in Santos (1995), Leit\u00e3o (2003) and Vaz (2007).\n\nThe momentum and mass balance equation are:\n\n?ui\n?t\n\n+\n? (uiuj )\n?xj\n\n= ?\n1\n?0\n?patm\n?x1\n\n?g\n?(?)\n?0\n\n??\n\n?x1\n?\n\ng\n\n?0\n\n? n\nx3\n\n???\n\n?xi\n?x3 +\n\n?\n\n?xj\n\n(\n?\n?ui\n?xj\n\n)\n? 2?ijk?juk\n\n(3.1)\n\n?u1\n?x1\n\n+\n?u2\n?x2\n\n+\n?u3\n?x3\n\n= 0 (3.2)\n\nwhere ui is the velocity vector components in the cartesian xi direction, ? is the turbulent\nviscosity, ? is the free surface elevation, g is the gravity acceleration, ?atm the atmospheric\npressure, ? the density and ?? is anomality, ?(?) is the free surface density, t is the time, h\nis the depth, ? is the earth velocity of rotation and ? is the alternate tensor.\n\nThe calculation of ? is obtained as function of water temperature and salinity by the\nUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) equation of\nstate (Fofonoff and Millard, 1983).\n\nThe model transport equation of heat and salt (or any other variable), is given by the\nadvection-diffusion equation:\n\n?C\n\n?t\n+ uj\n\n?C\n\n?xj\n=\n?C\n\n?xj\n(K\n\n?C\n\n?xi\n) + FP (3.3)\n\nwhere C is the property concentration, K the diffusion coefficient and FP is the gain or\nloss term.\n\nThe surface fluxes (importante for the heat transport) are composed by the momentum,\nsensible heat, latent heat, evaporation and infrared radiation (Chapra, 1997). The wind\nstress is calculated according to Equation 3.4:\n\n?uw = ?aCau10\n?\nu210 + v210 (3.4)\n\nwhere ?uw is the surface stress induced by the wind, ?a the air density, u10 and v10 are the\nhorizontal components of the wind measured at 10 m height above sea surface and Ca is\nthe drag coefficient (Riflet, 2010).\n\nThe model horizontal discretization is performed using an Arakawa C grid (Arakawa,\n\n\n\n3.2. Model implementation 19\n\n1966), while for the vertical coordinate an hybrid and generic scheme, which allows to choose\nbetween z-level, sigma and lagrangian coordinates (Martins et al., 1998; Riflet, 2010).\n\n3.2 Model implementation\n\nAs previously referred, two model implementations were used throughout this thesis.\nBoth applications are composed by nested grids and follow the downscaling methodology\nused by Leit\u00e3o et al. (2005) and Vaz et al. (2011).\n\nThe applications use three levels of one-way nested grids with different resolution. The\nestuarine model is a full 2D application that runs offline and is used to calculate the\nexchange flow between the Tagus estuary and the adjacent coastal area, while the coastal\nmodel is a full 3D application used to compute the propagation of the estuarine discharge\non the coastal region.\n\n3.2.1 Tagus Estuary model\n\nThe estuarine model implementation follows the procedure developed by Vaz et al.\n(2011) and Silva (2012). They present a 2D nested implementation with three domains\n(Figure 3.1). The first domain (E1) covers the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula and\nMorocco and is a 2D barotropic tidal model that is forced at the open ocean boundary with\nthe tidal solution from the Finite Element Solution 2004 (FES2004) model (Lyard et al.,\n2006). The grid has an horizontal resolution of 0.06o (? 6 km). The second domain (E2) is\na 2D domain with 0.01o resolution, covering the West coast of the central and southern\nregions of Portugal. Finally, the third domain (E3) is composed by 335 \u00d7 212 cells with\nvariable horizontal resolution (0.01-0.002o) covering all the Tagus Estuary and the adjacent\ncoast.\n\nFreshwater discharges from the Tagus, Sorraia and Tranc\u00e3o rivers, were imposed at E3\nland boundary, obtained from APA website (snirh.pt). Atmospheric forcing was imposed,\nin all E3 domain, using data from the EMG station. The models time step was 180 s, 60 s\nand 15 s for E1, E2 and E3, respectively. Further description is available in the Table 3.1.\n\nThe estuarine model has been validated by Vaz et al. (2011), using harmonic analysis\nresults of measured and predicted sea surface elevation in 12 stations along the estuary.\nThe results of the validation show a deviation lower than 5% of the local tidal amplitude\nfor most of stations, with an average difference of 5o in phase for the main constituent M2.\n\n\n\n20 Numerical Models and Methodology\n\nFigure 3.1: Numerical bathymetries used in each domain of the estuarine model, with depth\nin meters relative to the hydrographic null.\n\nConsequently, the implementation of this model was considered to be able to reproduce the\nmain patterns of the Tagus estuarine circulation.\n\nThe estuarine model was used to calculate the exchange flow between the estuary and\nthe near shelf that will be used as landward boundary condition for the coastal model.\n\n\n\n3.2.

(2009b) and uses three nested domains to compute circulation, heat and salt transport\nin the region off the Tagus Estuary (Figure 3.2).\n\nThe first domain (D1) represents the entire Portuguese continental coast (10.5oW,\n36.6oN and 6.1oW, 43.9oN), and is a 3D baroclinic model based on PCOMS model (Mateus\net al., 2012) with an horizontal resolution of 0.06o (? 6 km) and 50 vertical layers (7 sigma\n+ 43 Cartesian until the bottom). The second domain (D2) works as a 3D downscaling\nlevel with 0.02o (? 2 km) of horizontal resolution, representing the region between Sines\n(37.6oN) and Figueira da Foz (40.4oN). At last, the third domain (D3) represent the region\nof the Tagus estuary with a spatial horizontal resolution of 0.005o (? 500 m) between 38.2o\n\nand 39.5o N.\nThe model D1 gives the SSE, u, v and w velocity components, salinity and water\n\ntemperature to model D2, which is a 3D baroclinic model with 47 vertical layer used to\ndownscale the solution to the coastal model D3, which is used to compute the propagation\nand main features of the Tagus estuarine plume. D3 is a baroclinic model with 46 vertical\nlayers (7 sigma layers on the first 8.7 m and Cartesian coordinates from this depth to the\nbottom).\n\nAdditionally, the atmospheric forcing for D1 was provided by the MM5 atmospheric\nmodel forecast, with a spatial resolution of 9 km interpolated for the circulation model grid\n\n\n\n22 Numerical Models and Methodology\n\nFigure 3.2: Numerical bathymetries used in each domain of the coastal model, with depth\nin meters relative to the hydrographic null.\n\n(Sousa, 2002; Trancoso, 2012).\nThe bathymetry of D1 is based on SRTM 30\" topo-hydrographic database. D2 and\n\nD3 grids are based on the grids from ETOPO1 and GEBCO topo-hydrographic data. D3\nnumerical grid also uses other high-resolution available data for the estuary mouth. See\nTable 3.2 for summary of the coastal implementation. The model time step is 180 s, 60 s\nand 15 s for D1, D2 and D3, respectively.\n\nThe atmospheric forcing that was imposed in the D2 and D3 domains is predicted from\nthe WRF model run by the N\u00facleo de Modela\u00e7\u00e3o Estuarina e Costeira (NMEC) (Rodrigues\net al., 2015). The data were composed by hourly outputs of air temperature, relative\nhumidity, solar radiation and wind speed, with spatial resolution of 2 km.\n\nAt the D3 landward boundary, water exchange with the estuary is imposed, using the\ncalculated output from in the Tagus Estuarine model application.\n\n\n\n3.3.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis will be realized for SSE, u and v\ncomponents of surface current, temperature and salinity.\n\nIn this study, two different water statistical parameters will be calculated, following the\nprocedure by Dias and Lopes (2006). The parameters are:\n\n\u2022 RMSE - the root mean squared error calculates the absolute measure of the model\ndeviation from data, being one of the most used error parameter to assess tidal model\nperformance (Dias and Lopes, 2006; Oliveira et al., 2006):\n\nRMSE =\n{\n\n1\nN\n\nN?\ni=1\n\n[Xobs ?Xmodel]\n2\n}1\n\n2\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere N corresponds to the number of records and Xobs and Xmodel represent observed\nand calculated data, respectively. For local comparison of SSE, values between 5 and\n10 % should be considered very good (Dias et al., 2009).\n\n\u2022 SKILL - predictive skill from Willmott (1981) overcomes the sensitivity of correlation\n\n\n\n24 Numerical Models and Methodology\n\nstatistics to differences in predicted mean and variances (Legates and McCabe, 1999;\nWarner et al., 2005; Dias et al., 2009):\n\nSKILL = 1 ?\n? |Xmodel ?Xobs|\n\n2\n\n?(???Xmodel ? X?obs??? + ???Xobs ? X?obs???)2 (3.6)\nwhere values of 1 correspond to a perfect adjustment between predictions and obser-\nvations, while values of 0 indicates a complete disagreement. Higher values than 0.95\nshould be considered excellent (Dias et al., 2009).\n\nThe validation was performed using different datasets. SSE validation was performed\nusing water elevation measurements from the Cascais tide gauge. Surface currents are from\nan HF radar of the Portuguese navy installed to cover the region near the mouth of the\nTagus Estuary, confining the \"discharge bay\". Salinity and water temperature observations\nare from the AQUA-MODIS remote sensor.\n\nIn this study the SSE predictions from the model D3 was compared with observations\nof the Cascais\u2019s tide gauge. A period of 31 days, between 3-July-2012 and 3-August-2012\nwas simulated and were used two distinct approaches to evaluate the results: time series\nand harmonic constituents comparison.\n\nData from coastal HF radar have increased surface information on coastal currents.\nThe project SIMOC (http://www.hidrografico.pt/simoc.php) maintained by the Instituto\nHidrogr\u00e1fico (IH), is responsible for two radars in the study region, located in Forte de S\u00e3o\nJuli\u00e3o da Barra (38o 40\u2019N, 9o 19\u2019W) and Cabo Espichel lighthouse (38o 24\u2019N, 9o 12\u2019W).\nThe HF radar follows the implementation of the Sines radar (Fernandes and Agostinho,\n2008) and works at a 12 MHz frequency with a spatial resolution of 1.4 km. Radar data\nare obtained in a irregular grid covering all the region near the Tagus Estuary mouth, with\na hourly time step. Circulation model predictions were interpolated to the radar data grid,\nwith the same time step. According to Stewart and Joy (1974) and Sentchev et al. (2013),\nfor a 12 MHz frequency, the radar measures correspond to the integration of the first meter\nof the water column.\n\n3.3.1 Satellite data\n\nThe use of remote sensing imagery (i.e. MODIS ocean colour data) of SST is a valuable\ntool in the observation of large-scale oceanic processes. Furthermore, the spatial high-\nresolution of these images (? 1 km) are useful to the validation of heat transport models.\n\n\n\n3.4. Atmospheric model 25\n\nThe remote sensing data used in this study was obtained from the MODIS sensor, a\nkey instrument onboard of the Aqua (EOS PM) satellites. MODIS sensor acquires data\nin 36 spectral bands in a 2300 km wide swath with a nadir nominal resolution of 1000\nm (Nishihama et al., 1997). The data used here were Level2 (Lv2) products available at\nOceancolor website (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov). The long-wave SST product used\nwas obtained applying an algorithm that uses the MODIS 31 and 32 bands at 11 \u00b5m and\n12 \u00b5m. In each image the sensor performs a quality evaluation of the remote data. A quality\nflag of 0 indicates best quality while 4 indicates complete failure. therefore, for the analysis\ncomparison all pixels with quality flags higher than 1 were removed from the images. This\nthreshold was used since a quality flag of 1 can be representative of upwelling events (low\ntemperatures of SST not expected in the sensor climatology), high river discharge or even\nclouds (NASA, 2015).\n\nSalinity is a natural tracer for river plumes, but, in coastals region remote sensing\nimagery do not provide good resolution. For this variable several studies have identified\na significant correlation between the surface salinity and turbidity (Valente and da Silva,\n2009; Mendes et al., 2014; Fern\u00e1ndez-N\u00f3voa et al., 2015), based on the diference of optic\nproperties from the estuarine discharge to the ocean waters.\n\nThe identification of the Tagus estuarine outflow was performed using as proxy the\nhigh reflectivity plume waters, which are probably justified by the existence of suspended\nparticulate matter in it. Taking advantage of the available radiance bands in Lv2 product,\ndiverse tests were performed using the bands in 483-672 nm range. The most suitable for\nthis study was the 555 nm (nLw555) radiance band, which is consistent with the results\nfrom Nezlin and DiGiacomo (2005) and Mendes et al. (2014) for their studies on San Pedro\nShelf (southern California) and Douro estuarine plume, respectively.\n\nThe evaluation of the water temperature and turbidity from the model was performed\nusing a period from July to December of 2012, which was concurrent with the HF Radar\nobservations.\n\n3.4 Atmospheric model\n\nAs previously referred, wind stress plays a key role on the spreading of estuarine plumes,\ntherefore a proper meteorological forcing condition should be taken into account for an\naccurate reproduction of the water-air interaction (e.g. costal circulation and hydrography).\n\nFor the study region there are no high resolution atmospheric data available, being\n\n\n\n26 Numerical Models and Methodology\n\ndifficult to successfully force the circulation model and present accurate results. Also,\nthe orography of the Serra de Sintra, which acts as a natural wall to the northern wind\npropagation generating a \"shadow\" effect to the estuary mouth, can produce misleading\nresults regarding coastal hydrography and circulation as pointed out by Vaz et al. (2015).\nTherefore, in order to overcome this difficulty was implemented an atmospheric model for\nthe study area, with 2 km of spatial resolution. For this purpose, and in the frame of this\nwork, was implemented for the region under study the Weather Research and Forecasting\nmodel (WRF) version 3.6.1 (Skamarock et al., 2008). This model has being widely used, not\nonly by researchers, but also by institutions as national meteorological institutes (Pereira\net al., 2013). The implementation developed uses three two-way nested domains. The\ndownscaling methodology follows a domain ratio of 1/3, with the father domain (WRF1)\ncovering most of the Iberian Peninsula with a spatial resolution of 18 km. The two other\ndomains (WRF2 and WRF3) present 6 and 2 km resolution, respectively (Figure 3.3).\n\nThe atmospheric model boundary condition is predicted each 6 hours by the Global\nForecast System (GFS) model (NCEP, 2003) with 1o spatial resolution. The vertical\ndiscretization was composed by 28 unequal spaced layers at each domain.\n\nFigure 3.3: Nested domains used for atmospheric simulations.\n\n\n\n3.4. Atmospheric model 27\n\n3.4.1 Validation of the WRF model\n\nAiming to validate the meteorological model outputs, was performed an assessment\nof the WRF3 model. Model predictions of air temperature, wind intensity and direction\nwere compared with EMG station measurements (Figure 2.4). The visual assessment of the\nmodel results revealed that it can accurately reproduce the general variability of the data\n(for both variables). Then a quantitative evaluation was performed comparing the model\npredictions and the EMG station observations. The EMG station is located near Cascais,\na very urbanized area, situated south of Serra de Sintra.\n\nThe wind intensity and direction are two important variables to characterize the\natmosphere dynamics. However, they are difficult to predict with accuracy, especially at\nthe Lisbon Bay due the existence of Serra de Sintra. From Figure 3.4 is noticeable that\nmodel overestimates wind intensity, presenting RMSE values of 4.89 ms?1 (27% of the local\nwind intensity amplitude). For the wind direction, the model presents better performance\n(RMSE of 41.8o (13.4% of the local amplitude)), which reveal an adequate reproduction of\nthe temporal patterns. Some discrepancies could be attributed to the fast changes induced\nby maritime breeze in this area (Alcoforado and Lopes, 2003).\n\nConcerning the air temperature predictions, the WRF outputs show a SKILL score of\n\nFigure 3.4: Variability of WRF3 data and EMG station data for temperature (Temp), wind\nintensity (Int) and direction (Dir), humidity (Hum) and radiation (Rad) for 10-31th of\nDecember 2007.

Regarding solar radiation and\nrelative humidity a very good correlation between in situ data and model predictions was\ncomputed, with SKILLS of 0.97 and 0.82, respectively. Full quantitative assessments are\npresented on Table 3.3.\n\nThe atmospheric model implementation was considered successfully validated for the\nstudy region. The results show that the model is able to accurately reproduce the main\natmospheric features of this region, being able to produce accurate boundary conditions for\nthe coastal model.\n\nTable 3.3: Quantitative assessment of WRF model predictions with EMG station observa-\ntions for the period of 10-31th of December 2007.\n\nTemp Int Dir Rad Hum\n(oC) (ms?1) (o) Wm?2 (%)\n\nRMSE 1.91 4.89 32.42 9.57 18.18\nSKILL 0.83 0.48 0.73 0.97 0.81\n\n3.5 Wind patterns assessment in the Tagus region\n\nThe influence of the wind stress on the surface of the ocean has a large impact on surface\ncurrent variability. This is quite true in estuarine plume propagation studies. The adjacent\ncoast of the Tagus Estuary is highly influenced by the wind variability. For that reason\na seasonal assessment was performed in order to identify the dominant wind patterns, in\nterms of more frequent and significant wind directions and intensity.\n\nThe wind characterization was performed through the analysis of data from the meteo-\nrological station of the Lisbon airport (Figure 2.4). This station is located in the middle of\nthe city presenting one of the longer time series of data in the region, and can be considered\nrepresentative of the wind patterns in the study region. The available data comprises the\nperiod from 2001 to 2007.\n\nThe events were splinted following the Beaufort wind force scale that relates the wind\nspeed to observed conditions at sea. The statistics of wind intensity and direction (Table\n3.4) has identified the probability of calm winds (bellow 1.5 ms?1) to be near 8.1%. Light,\ngentle and moderated breezes present similar percentages, corresponding to a total of 84.6%\nand in only 7.3% of the cases the wind is higher than 8 ms?1.\n\n\n\n3.5. Wind patterns assessment in the Tagus region 29\n\nTable 3.4: Percentage of events observed in each range of wind speed according to Beautfort\nscale for the airport station for the period between January 2001 and December 2007.\n\nWind Limits\n(ms?1)\n\nBeaufort Scale\ndescription General DJF MAM JJA SON\n\nless then 1.5 Calm 8.1 11.5 6.4 3.7 11.1\n1.5 - 3.3 Light breeze 30.2 36.0 28.4 20.4 36.5\n3.3 - 5.5 Gentle breeze 34.4 34.0 34.8 35.3 33.6\n5.5 - 8.0 Moderate breeze 20.0 13.7 22.5 28.8 14.5\n8.0 - 10.8 Fresh breeze 6.0 3.6 6.6 10.2 3.4\n\nmore then 10.8 Strong breeze 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.6 0.8\n\nThe seasonal variability was evaluated in order to identify the main wind direction\nfor each season. The original data was divided in winter (DJF - December, January and\nFebruary), spring (MAM - March, April and May), summer (JJA - June, July and August)\nand autumn (SON - September, October and November) and wind roses for each season\nare presented in Figure 3.5.\n\nDuring winter, the dominant direction is from NE with about 20% of the occurrence,\nfollowed by NNW direction with 12% of occurrences (Figure 3.5a). 80% of the wind intensity\nwas lower than 5.5 ms?1.\n\nSpring season shows a strong influence (37%) of winds from NW and NNW (Figure\n3.5b). The wind intensity increases comparatively to the winter, with less than 70% of the\ncases below 5.5 ms?1. Strong winds from the N-NW quadrant were identify in the region.\n\nThe Summer season results are very similar to the spring results (Figure 3.5c). Here\nenergetic winds with over 40% of observations higher than 5.5 ms?1 are observed. The major\npredominant directions are: NW and NNW with 30% and 28% of occurrences, respectively.\n\nAutumn season presents a similarity with the winter season, specially in intensity. More\nthen 80% of the observations show a wind intensity lower than 5.5 ms?1 (Figure 3.5d).\n\nThe previous results are similar to those obtained by Angi (2011) and Lopes et al.\n(2013). Moreover, Alcoforado (1987) has identified about 45% of the days with predominant\nnorthern winds.\n\n\n\n30 Numerical Models and Methodology\n\n(a) December, January and February.

The method is similar to a classic EOF\nanalysis, but presents more effective results on the computation of coastal variability (Liu\net al., 2006b)\n\nThe Kohonen\u2019s Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that\nhave the capacity of learning without supervision. This algorithm was developed in the\n\n\n\n3.6. Self-Organizing Maps 31\n\nearly 80\u2019s of the XX century by Kohonen (1982) during the research of auto-associative\nmemory. Here, the SOM as \"visualization and analysis tool for high dimensional data\" is\ndescribed. Moreover, the algorithm can be used for clustering, dimensional ordering and\nreduction, classification and sampling (Lobo, 2009).\n\nThe SOM analysis was performed using the SOM Toolbox 2.0 (Vesanto et al., 2000).\nThis toolbox was generated for MATLAB R\u00a9 being maintained by the Helsinki Technical\nUniversity. It is a freely available on the institution website (http://www.cis.hut.fi/).\n\nTo perform a SOM analysis, each data series was reshaped to a row vector forming a\n2D matrix (data array). At each interaction, the row vectors are used to update the weight\nof the SOM via an unsupervised learning algorithm. The final weight vectors are then\nreshaped back to the original grid and provide different data patterns depending on the\nmapping requested (illustrative of SOM working system in Figure 3.6).\n\nThis training is an interactive process. At each training step one sample vector x from\nthe input data set will be chosen randomly and the distance between it and all the weight\nvectors will be calculated. The calculation follow the Euclidian distance method, where the\ncloser neuron to the input vector x is the wining neuron, called Best-Matching Unit (BMU).\n\nFigure 3.6: Schematic illustration of SOM organizing system (adapted from Richardson\net al. (2003)).\n\n\n\n32 Numerical Models and Methodology\n\nThe toolbox BMU calculation follows the procedure from equation 3.7:\n\n?x?mc? = min{?x?mi?} (3.7)\n\nwhere ?.? represents the distance measure. The toolbox has improved from the original\ncode, introducing interpolation of missing values and mask for excluding certain variables.\n\nAfter the identification of the BMU, the SOM weight vectors are updated moving the\nBMU closer to input vector. This leads to a stretching of the BMU and is topological\nneighbours in direction of the vector sample. The calculation of unit i weight vector follows\nequation 3.8:\n\nmi(t + 1) = mi(t) + ?(t)?(t)[x(t) ?mi(t)] (3.8)\n\nwhere t stand for time, x(t) is a random input vector from input data set at time t, ? the\nneighbourhood kernel around the winner c and ? the learning rate for the snapshot t.\n\nThe training of SOM is usually performed in two phases: the first one, using a high\nlearning rate and neighbour radius; in the second phase, both of the previous parameters\nare set for small values right from the beginning of evolution calculus. This action leads the\nfirst training of the SOM to reproduce the same space of the input data and then adjust\nthe previous information\u2019s improving the training map (Vesanto et al., 2000).\n\n3.7 Scenarios description\n\nOnce the coastal model is validated, it may be used to assess the impact of several\nscenarios of river inflow and wind in the Tagus estuarine plume propagation, namely in\nsalinity and water temperature variability.\n\nIn order to study the region variability, a set of scenarios were designed and the effect\nof the wind and river inflow in the coastal hydrography studied (Figure 3.7).\n\nIn this study three scenarios were simulated: Scenario A (ScA) considered as reference,\ncomposed by discharge and wind forcing, Scenario B (ScB) without wind forcing and\nScenario C (ScC) without Tagus estuarine discharge. In each scenario three distinct\nTagus River discharges (Figure 3.8) were implemented: 1500 m3s?1 (Discharge1) and\n3000 m3s?1 (Discharge2) representative of the 90 and 99 percentile results of the long\ndischarge series analysis, respectively, and a 5000 m3s?1 (Discharge3) river discharge\nrepresentative of a high discharge event registered in March-April of 2013. The scenario\n\n\n\n3.7. Scenarios description 33\n\nFigure 3.7: Scheme of the scenarios implementation.\n\nsimulation was performed for a 23 days period, starting in 8 November of 2012.\nTwo new scenarios were calculated from scenarios A to C. Scenario D (ScD) results\n\nfrom the difference of ScA and ScB while Scenario E (ScE) results from the difference of\nScA and ScC, aiming to understand the influence of wind and river inflow, respectively.\n\nFigure 3.8: Tagus river discharge used in each scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nResults and Discussion\n\n4.1 Model validation\n\nThe estuarine model used in this study was previously implemented by Vaz et al. (2011)\nand used to study circulation and hydrography features of the Tagus Estuary (Vaz et al.,\n2011; Silva, 2012). More details on the model\u2019s implementation can be found in these\nstudies. Therefore, the results presented in this section are only related with the coastal\nmodel validation procedure.\n\n4.1.1 Sea surface elevation\n\nSSE from the model was compared with data from the Cascais tide gauge, in order to\nevaluate the model skill in reproducing water elevation in the coast near the Tagus mouth\n(Figure 4.1).\n\nFigure 4.1: Predicted (?) and observed (\u2022) normalized SSE (m) for Cascais tide gauge\nused in the validation of the coastal application.\n\n35\n\n\n\n36 Results and Discussion\n\nThe predicted SSE follows the observed records, with a root mean squared error (RMSE)\nand SKILL of 0.33 m (9.8% of relative error to local observed amplitude) and 0.96,\nrespectively, revealing the model\u2019s accuracy in reproducing the tidal wave propagation in\nthe region near Tagus mouth.\n\nIn order to quantify the main differences between model predictions and observed data, a\ncomparison of the amplitudes and phases of the main solar (K1, O1, Q1) and lunar (M2, S2,\nN2) constituents was performed using the harmonic analysis software T_Tide (Pawlowicz\net al., 2002). A 31 days time series of hourly observed and predicted SSE data was used\n(Table 4.1). The overall distribution of the observed and predicted amplitude and phase\nare similar. The M2 and S2 constituents are responsible for more than 80% of the tidal\nenergy. M2 presents an amplitude error of 0.5 cm and a phase lag of 3.4 (about 7 minutes),\nwhile for S2 the amplitude error was 0.4 cm with a lag of 4.5o (about 9 minutes). For the\ndiurnal constituents the amplitude errors range from 0.3 to 1.4 cm and for the phase errors\nbetween 0.6 and 26.5o, respectively. The tide is semi-diurnal, with a Form Number (FN) of\n0.14 (Defant, 1960).\n\nIn general, the harmonic analysis results show that the circulation model reproduces\nwell the tide amplitude and phase.\n\nTable 4.1: Difference of harmonic constituents, amplitude (cm) and phase (?) for the main\ntide constituents.

These are key and\nchallenging validation parameters due to their characteristic high spatial and temporal\nvariability. Here surface water velocity (first meter) from the model was compared with\ndata from the HF radar installed in the region. As a measure of the mean deviation of the\n\n\n\n4.1. Model validation 37\n\nmodel predictions to the HF radar observations, the RMSE and SKILL were calculated\nusing data of November 2012. For this period, 622 HF radar data fields (of 744 possible)\nwere available. Both error calculations were performed for the zonal (u) and meridional (v)\ncurrent components, at each radar grid cell.\n\nThe mean RMSE value across the region is 14.9 cms?1 and 15.9 cms?1 for zonal and\nmeridional component, respectively. That is, these values represent relative errors to local\namplitude of 22.0 and 17.8% in u and v current components, respectively (Figure 4.2).\nSKILL assessment for the same period (Figure 4.3), shown a better representation by the\ncirculation model of the v current component, with a mean value of 0.71, while for the u\ncurrent component, the obtained mean value was 0.52.\n\nHF radar measures could suffer from limitation that may produce erroneous RMS and\nSKILL values. One of those limitations is the Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP),\nthat appears when the angle between two radial vectors is too large to enable accurate\nresolutions of the component perpendicular to the radial (Chapman et al., 1997; Trujillo\net al., 2004; O\u2019Donncha et al., 2015). This limitation could be the reason for the low\nquality results obtained in the baseline region (line that connect the two HF radar stations),\nspecially for the u current component.\n\nDespite the RMS and SKILL values, those are consistent with studies by other authors.\n\nFigure 4.2: RMSE assessment between model simulations and HF radar measure current in\n(A) zonal and (B) meridional component of velocity. Magnitude of deviation in cms?1.\n\n\n\n38 Results and Discussion\n\nFigure 4.3: SKILL assessment between model simulations and HF radar measure current in\nthe (A) zonal and (B) meridional component of velocity.\n\nIn fact, O\u2019Donncha et al. (2015) performed a similar study in Galway Bay (Ireland), where\nthey obtained a mean RMSE deviation over 23.8 cms?1 with SKILL score of 0.7 (zonal)\nand 0.56 (meridional) for current velocity.\n\nIn order to evaluate the temporal variability of surface currents in the region, and to\ncompare model predictions with radar data at specific points within the plume pathways\n(Figure 4.3 - P1, P2, P3 and P4), several monitoring points were chosen (Figure 4.4).\n\nIn P1 is visible the influence of the tide on both current components. Additionally, the\nestuary mouth bathymetry presents special features, as the existence of a small island, Bugio.\nFor that region, a circulation model using a grid of 500 m could not be enough to fully\ndescribe the circulation here, the RMS error is 18.2 and 20.7%, respectively. Moreover, this\nregion present complex circulation features with two \u201cpermanent eddies\u201d (Fortunato et al.,\n1997; Vaz and Dias, 2014), which can modulate the circulation, turning it less predictable\nwith a 500 m resolution model. However, for other points is found a good reproduction of\nthe observed data, with RMSE values of local amplitude for u velocity component of 18.1,\n23.7 and 20.3% and for v velocity component of 12.6, 16.4 and 17.5%, for stations P2, P3\nand P4, respectively.\n\nDespite of differences, the model predictions can describe the spatial and temporal\nvariability of surface currents, therefore, was considered validated for the region.\n\n\n\n4.1. Model validation 39\n\nFigure 4.4: Time series overlapping of model predictions (red line) and HF radar surface\ncurrent components (blue dots), for the points displayed in Figure 4.3. Left column represent\nzonal component and right column the meridional component of current.\n\n4.1.3 Satellite vs model SST and salinity\n\nOnce the circulation model is considered validated, it is necessary to evaluate the\ntransport model. One way to evaluate water temperature and salinity predictions is to\ncompare model outputs with satellite imagery. This would give a spatial assessment of\nthe local patterns for these variables. In this thesis an assessment was performed for the\nsimulation period, from July to December of 2012 (Figures 4.5 and 4.6). Images that present\nmore valid pixels after quality flag cleaning were chosen to compare with model outputs.\n\nOverall deviation of predicted SST comparatively to the remote sensing images shows\nvalues under 2oC. In spite of the low difference value, the objective is the accurate spatial\nvariation reproduction. The model could reproduce the general spatial variability of SST,\nwith higher values found in regions far of the coast, decreasing towards the coast region.\nDespite the similar patterns found, it is important to highlight the existence of small\ndeviations. Low temperature bands near coast tend to be thinner in the predicted than in\nthe remote sensing data, while offshore high temperature zones, observed in remote sensing\nimages, have lower temperature values in the model predictions.\n\nIn order to evaluate salinity surface patterns, images from the MODIS nLw555 were used\nas plume tracers (Figure 4.6). Low salinity fields resulting from the Tagus Estuary discharge\nwere compared with the high turbidity values. In general, the model could reproduce the\nspatial pattern of the plume, with the low salinity regions located in the same regions of\nhigh turbidity. Under southward winds, remote imagery shows a S-SW propagation of the\n\n\n\n40 Results and Discussion\n\nF\nigure\n\n4.5:\nC\nom\n\nparison\nofSST\n\nfrom\nM\nO\nD\nIS\n\nsensor\n(upper\n\nrow\n)\nand\n\ncirculation\nm\nodeloutput\n\n(bottom\nrow\n\n)\nfor\n\nthe\ndays\n\n12,18\nand\n\n21\nofJuly\n\nand\n31\n\nofA\nugust\n\nof2012.\nW\n\nhite\nvectors\n\nrepresent\nthe\n\nprevious\n6\nhours\n\nm\nean\n\nw\nind\n\ndirections.\n\n\n\n4.1.

This could\nbe the result of chlorophyll blooms, which may change the optical properties of the waters.\nSimilarly, near the Sado Estuary mouth region (south of Cabo Espichel) high turbidity\nvalues are observed, resulting probably from the estuarine discharge. However, this estuarine\noutflow is not implemented on the transport model disallowing their comparison.\n\nTaking into account all the previous results, the transport model was considered validated\nand, therefore, it can be used to study issues concerning water temperature and salinity\nlocal variations.\n\n4.2 Scenarios\n\n4.2.1 Self-Organizing Maps\n\nIn this work, the variability of the salinity in the coast off the Tagus Estuary was study\nusing the SOM toolbox. The evaluation of coastal variability was performed using predicted\nfields of surface salinity from the previously defined scenarios: ScA, ScB and ScC.\n\nThe results of the simulation with atmospheric forcing (observed wind intensity and\ndirection, Figure 4.7 - F) and a maximum river discharge of 5000 m3s?1 (ScA-A3, Figure\n4.7 - G) are depicted in Figure 4.7. Four nodes were used to reproduce the spatial salinity\nvariability identified by the SOM analysis, in which the Node 1 is representative of the pre-\ndischarge signal, and represents 28.2% of the local variability, while Node 2 is representative\nof a transitional wind regime, and represents 25.1% of the local variability. Node 3 represents\na upwelling favourable wind period after high river discharge (28.5% of the local variability).\nNode 4 is representative of the high river discharge signal and counts for 18.2% of the total\nvariance of the system.\n\nA BMU number represents each SOM spatial node, at each instant. BMU\u2019s time series\nwere sorted by plume size and compared with local wind stress and river discharge time\nseries (Figure 4.7 - E, F and G). The relation between discharge and BMU\u2019s time series\nis well reproduced for the high discharge event observed until day 18, following a BMU\nsequence of 1-2-3-4-3-2-1. For the rest of the simulation period, the wind stress obtains\nthe higher relation with BMU\u2019s 1 and 3, being representative of strong and weak upwelling\n\n\n\n4.2.

Bottom panel shows time series of (E) BMU, (F) wind stress and (G) freshwater\nriver discharge.\n\nfavourable winds, respectively. Under downwelling favourable winds, BMU3 is the most\nrepresentative.\n\nIn Figure 4.8 is depicted the SOM analysis of the ScB-B3 in order to obtain the influence\nof the freshwater inflow, with a maximum estuarine discharge of 5000 m3s?1 (ScB-B3,\nFigure 4.8 - F) without wind stress forcing. The four nodes represent the stages of the\nplume evolution, under high discharge without wind forcing (Figure 4.8 - A, B, C and D).\nThe Node 1 represent the initial state, representing 24.5% of the total variance. Nodes 2\nand 3 are the result of the increasing estuarine discharge and represent 12.5 and 19% of the\ntotal variability, respectively. The full developed plume resultant of the high river discharge\nis represented by the Node 4 (44% of the total variance).\n\nFrom the SOM analysis is visible that all nodes show a surface bulge confined to shore.\n\n\n\n44 Results and Discussion\n\nFigure 4.8: A 1x4 SOM representation of the surface salinity field for ScB-B3 for the period\nof 8-31 of November. Upper panel (A-D) represent the SOM pattern. The frequency of\noccurrence is shown in the figure, as the surface mean velocity vectors for the period of each\nBMU. Bottom panel shows time series of (E) BMU and (F) freshwater river discharge.\n\nSimilar effects were identified in several studies of surface-advected plumes on the North\nHemisphere (Chao and Boicourt, 1986; Chao, 1988; Kourafalou et al., 1996). These authors\nhave concluded that the surface buoyant outflows spread radially from the estuary mouth\nand are deflected to the right by the Coriolis force.\n\nBMU\u2019s time series were ordered by the plume dimension and compared with the river\ndischarge time series (Figure 4.8 - E and F). The relation between series shows a delay in\nthe maximum river discharge and the observation of the BMU4. The BMU\u2019s follow the\n1-2-3-4 sequence followed by a slow reduction from 4-3-2. The slow reduction of the surface\nsalinity may be the result of the lack of wind mixing and lower transport velocities.\n\nThe results of the simulation without estuarine discharge (ScC-C3) to evaluate the wind\neffect on the plume propagation are represented in Figure 4.9. SOM analysis used four\nnodes to reproduce the spatial salinity field. Node 1, Node 2 and Node 3 were representative\nof 16.8%, 14.4% and 10.3% of local variability, respectively, while Node 4 is the dominant\nnode, with 58.5% of the local variability. In all nodes is visible that the salinity variability\nis controlled by a northward coastal circulation observed during the simulation period, that\n\n\n\n4.2.

In the region of Tagus Estuary\nmouth is observed the salinity signal produced by the period of spin up before the scenario\nimplementation.\n\nEach SOM spatial node was represented by a BMU number, at each instant, being\nordered by the dimension of high salinity region and compared with local wind stress time\nseries (Figure 4.9 - E and F). It was not identified a relation between SOM salinity BMUs\ntime series and wind stress. Nevertheless, when performing a relation with the node\u2019s\nsurface current was possible to identify that under downwelling favourable winds (Node 3)\nis observed an increase of the surface current towards north.\n\n4.2.2 Influence region\n\nIn this section, the propagation area of the Tagus estuarine plume is identified, evaluating\nthe role of the main forcings and how estuarine buoyancy affects the hydrography in different\nareas of the study region, by identifying regions where salinity increase or decrease.\n\n\n\n46 Results and Discussion\n\nIn this section the calculated scenarios, ScD representative of the wind influence and\nScE for discharge influence were used. In both scenarios, downwelling (16th November) and\nupwelling (18th November) favourable wind events were identified, and the mean salinity\nfor each day calculated. The spatial salinity fields are obtained by subtracting ScB (coastal\ncurrent + estuarine outflow) and ScC (coastal current + wind) to ScA (coastal current +\nestuarine outflow + wind) in order to obtain ScD (wind effect) and ScE (discharge effect).\nThe river inflow for ScA and ScB is 3000 m3s?1.\n\nThe effect of southern/northern winds in the horizontal salinity structure is depicted\nin Figure 4.10. It can be observed a band of positive values of salinity close to the coast\nduring downwelling (further south) and upwelling periods. This is induced by the wind\nstress that confines (expands) the plume close to the coast (to offshore) during downwelling\n(upwelling) periods. This is the result of the subtraction of the results of ScA and ScB,\nin which, this last scenario produces a low salinity band advected to the north with low\n\nFigure 4.10: ScD results for a downwelling (A and C) and upwelling (B and D) events. A\nand B represent the salinity differences, while C and D mean surface current variation.\n\n\n\n4.2. Scenarios 47\n\nsalinity values (estuarine).\nIt can be observed in the velocity fields that, surface currents are modulated by the\n\nwind, and that during downwelling (upwelling) the currents are to the north (south) in the\nregion close to the west coast and near estuary mouth.\n\nThe effect of the estuarine discharge in the horizontal salinity structure is depicted in\nFigure 4.11 and is the result of the subtraction of ScA and ScC. In opposition to the results\nshown in Figure 4.10, here the effect of the estuarine discharge produces bands of negative\nvalues. That scenario of wind plus coastal current (ScC) presents higher values of salinity\nin the coastal region, which is expected since a null estuarine discharge was considered in\nthis scenario. In the Figure 4.11 it is shown that, during downwelling events a band of\nnegative values is found close to the estuary mouth and in the west coast. During upwelling\nevents, the estuarine discharge is advected towards the south in the region of the Lisbon\n\nFigure 4.11: ScE results for a downwelling (A and C) and upwelling (B and D) events. A\nand B represent the salinity differences, while C and D mean surface current variation.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2. Scenarios 49\n\nand no winds periods under different Tagus River discharges. Blue color represents a typical\nnorthward wind period, when the plume is confined close to the west coast in a direct\nresponse to wind forcing. Here, is observed a plume that goes from the Lisbon Bay until\nnorth of Peniche is observed. Orange color represents the observed SW path followed by the\nplume under southward winds, where it is advected onto the shelf as result of the combined\neffect of estuarine discharge and favourable upwelling winds. At last, the dashed grey lines\nrepresent the region of influence of the estuarine discharge under the no wind scenario.\nHere, the plume forms a bulge in the region close to the estuary mouth and due to the high\nestuarine discharge there is a band of estuarine water, which is advected up to the mouth\nuntil the regions close to Peniche.\n\n4.2.3 Cross sections\n\nThe definition of surface-advected plume lies in the fact that the buoyant inflow re-\nmains primarily in shelf top, forming a thin layer that has little contact with the bottom,\nexceptionally near estuarine mouth (Yankovsky and Chapman, 1997). In this section,\nthe x and y velocity components are evaluated through the cross-sections depicted in\nFigure 4.13. Here the main objective is to evaluate the plume thickness and preferential\nvelocity directions, through, three cross-sections defined. Section S1, located at 38.67oN\naims to represent the Tagus Estuary predominant outflow directions, therefore, u current\n\nFigure 4.13: Cross-sections location in D3.\n\n\n\n50 Results and Discussion\n\ncomponent was evaluated. In S2 cross-section the narrowest region of the D3, located at\n38.79oN, v component is evaluated aiming to analyse the velocity component and plume\npath under northward winds. Finally, cross-sections S3 is a meridional slice at 9.52oW used\nto analyse the water movement due to a southern and northern wind pattern (u component\nis analysed). All the analysis in these sections were performed for ScA-A3, the scenario\nwith full atmospheric forcing and the maximum river discharge value (5000 m3s?1).\n\nFor each section was chosen a downwelling (A), transitional (B) and upwelling (C) wind\nrepresentative period. The results are depicted in Figures 4.14-4.16.\n\nUnder northward winds in S1 sections, the plume is observed between the 9.5oW and\nthe coast. In the region adjacent to the coast (9.3oW) the plume comprises the full water\ncolumn, while in the rest have a thickness of about 15 m (Figure 4.14 - A). The predicted\ncurrents show an intense negative u current component on the region where is observed the\nplume near the surface layers. Under the plume bulge is observed a positive u flow, that\ncould be the reposition of the surface offshore advected waters, in order to maintain the\nequilibrium. A transition period in section S1 results in a lower thickness of the buoyant\nplume and its offshore displacement (Figure 4.14 - B). The thickness of the plume is reduced\nto 10 m, while in all the region located west of 9.5oW a negative u current velocity in\nthe water column is observed, due to the water offshore advection. Finally, Figure 4.14\n- C describes an upwelling event where the plume is confined to a region between 9.3oW\n\nFigure 4.14: Salinity section S1. x component of velocity, with positive (solid lines) and\nnegative (dashed lines) values. (A) downwelling, (B) transitional (C) and upwelling winds.\n\n\n\n4.2. Scenarios 51\n\nand the shore. The overall analysis of the S1 section reveal three different regions: near\nthe estuary mouth mainly controlled by the estuarine discharge (9.3oW - coast) with a\nnegative u current component; a region between 9.5-9.3oW with bottom positive u velocity\ncomponent and an offshore region (west of 9.5oW) that responds directly to wind.\n\nIn cross-sections S2, located in the region of Cabo da Roca, is possible to identify the\nestuarine buoyant flow in the first 10 m of the water column, in a narrow band of 12 km\nadjacent to coast during a downwelling event (Figure 4.15 - A). In this region, on the\nsurface a strong northward flow induced by the plume is observed, while in depth a larger\narea with negative flow is observed. This could be due to a compensatory mechanism,\nobserved by other authors under buoyant plumes (Mestres et al., 2007; Jurisa and Chant,\n2013). Offshore region of S2 (9.6oW to west) shows positive v current components in all the\ncolumn water, with higher values located in the middle section (near 9.7oW) with values\nover 0.2 ms?1.\n\nIn the transition between northward and southward winds, the plume spreads offshore\nfor 18.5 km with a reduction of the plume thickness (Figure 4.15 - B). A detachment of the\nplume from the shore is noticeable. This could be the result of the negative v component\nhigh values. The offshore region presents a decrease of the positive v values in the superficial\nlayers.\n\nFor southward winds the existent plume vanishes, while new buoyancy plumes are not\n\nFigure 4.15: Salinity cross-section S2. y component of velocity, with positive (solid lines)\nand negative (dashed lines) values. Downwelling winds (A), transitional (B) and upwelling\nwinds (C).\n\n\n\n52 Results and Discussion\n\ntransported to this cross-shelf sections once that, under southward winds, the plume path is\nto SW (Figure 4.15 - C). Surface currents present a negative v component, while the vertical\ncolumn present three distinct areas: near shelf with negative v component, an intermediate\nregion (9.8-9.65oW) with a positive intense v jet (near 30 m depth) compressed between\nnegative v flows (top and bottom) and an offshore region with positive v component in\nmost of the column.\n\nCross-sections S3 covers a wide region of the adjacent coast to Tagus Estuary. In\nthis sections, under northward winds the plume can be identified in the region between\n38.6-39.1oN with a depth of about 15 m (Figure 4.16 - A). The south region of S3 presents\nnegative u velocity values, while the northern region presents positive u velocity values. The\ncentral region have a complex pattern with the surface layer being forced by the buoyant\nplume.\n\nWith the wind rotation to south (upwelling favourable), surface currents begin to\npresent negative u values (Figure 4.16 - B). The salinity field gradient decreases while is\nobserved vertical mixing and an horizontal surface spreading. For the upwelling event, a\nplume break-up is observed and is possible to identify two distinct areas with low salinity\n(Figure 4.16 - C). The southern area is the offshore advection of the Tagus Estuary outflow,\nwhile the northern area is the result of the old plume field being advected from the coast\n\nFigure 4.16: Salinity cross-section S3. x component of velocity, with positive (solid lines) and\nnegative (dashed lines) values.(A) Downwelling winds, (B) transitional and (C) upwelling\nwinds.\n\n\n\n4.2. Scenarios 53\n\nto offshore (crossing the section in analysis). Negative u velocity are observed for all the\nsection. Nevertheless, bellow the 30 m is observed a positive u flow region, due to the\nupwelling of waters from the deeper areas.\n\nNorth-south S3 cross-section analysis allowed to classify three distinct current zones\n(Figure 4.16): a southern region that presents negative u velocity values; a central region,\nbetween 38.6 and 39.4oN, controlled by the wind and estuarine inflow; and the northern\nregion where was observed positive u velocity. These results show a distinct hydrodynamic\npattern between south and north regions of the domain, illustrating the region of influence\nof the Tagus estuarine plume.\n\nAn overall illustration of the typical observed plume pattern and v velocity component for\nthe S2 cross-shelf section was performed and presented in Figure 4.17. The cross inside the\ncircle represented positive v velocity and negative flows are represented by concentric circles;\nthe dimension of the circles represents the magnitude of the signal.

Positive v velocities were observed in the near shelf,\nin the bottom and top layers, though is observed a relative strong negative v jet in the\nmiddle of the water column.\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nConclusion\n\nAll the proposed objectives for this study were achieved, within the main goal to research\nthe Tagus Estuarine plume under different wind regimes and river discharges. With that\npurpose, a new circulation and transport model (MOHID) application was implemented.\n\nAn offline 2D circulation and transport model was implemented for the Tagus Estuary.\nThis implementation was previously validated by Vaz et al. (2011) and Silva (2012) and\nused to calculate the exchange flow between the estuary and the near shelf region, to be\nused as landward boundary condition in the coastal model.\n\nThe costal application is a 3D baroclinic model based on PCOMS model, with a spatial\nhorizontal resolution of 0.06o and 50 vertical layers. A downscaling methodology was used\nto improve spatial resolution to 500 m in the Tagus ROFI. The model validation was\nsuccessfully performed comparing predictions with avilable data sets.\n\nThe coastal model predictions of surface currents were validated trough the comparison\nwith a Portuguese Navy HF radar dataset. The results show a good reproduction of the\nobservations with a mean RMSE of local amplitude of 22.0% and 17.8% for u and v velocity\ncomponents, respectively, with the same accuracy degree of other identical studies. The\ncoastal model transport validation (water temperature and salinity) was performed by\ncomparing model results and remote sensing imagery from MODIS sensor. Results shown\nthat model SST show an identical surface pattern, with a maximum deviation lower than\n2 oC. For surface salinity field assessment, MODIS nLw555 turbidity band was used to\nidentify the plume bulge at the Lisbon Bay. Results showed that the model predictions of\nthe plume dimension and location were identical to remote sensing high turbidity regions\nat the region.\n\nThe coupling methodology was then considered able to reproduce observations and,\n\n55\n\n\n\n56 Conclusion\n\ntherefore able to simulate estuarine and coastal processes for the study region.\n\nAfter the model validation, five scenarios were implemented to study the plume under\ndifferent wind and discharge events. Scenario A was considered as the reference scenario,\nwith a complete atmosphere and river discharge forcing; scenario B is a no wind stress\nscenario and scenario C does not consider estuarine discharges. Scenarios D and E resulted\nfrom the subtraction of scenario A - scenario B and scenario A - scenario C, respectively.\nFor each scenario, three distinct simulations were performed using different river discharges\n(1500, 3000 and 5000 m3s?1).\n\nThe use of self-organizing maps, an unsupervised neural networks, allowed to identify\nthe variability of the region. That methodology was used to assess the scenarios A, B and\nC. Results showed that the salinity pattern was controlled by the discharge during high\nriver discharge, while for low discharge values the wind stress was the main forcing. In\nabsence of estuarine discharge, surface salinity has no relation with wind, and the coastal\ncirculation was the predominant forcing.\n\nThe differences obtained in the scenarios D and E results give a spatial idea about\nregions of influence of discharge and wind, respectively. This study allowed to identify the\ninfluence area of the wind and discharges in the plume propagation. The results show that\nthe river discharge has a direct role on the plume dimension, with higher discharge values\nproducing larger bulges. Surface currents were also analysed and the results show that\nthe estuarine discharges produce an increase of current velocity, under downwelling winds,\nnear 0.9 ms?1 for a 3000 m3s?1 river discharge, while for upwelling winds, an increase of\n0.2 ms?1 was observed.\n\nThe plume path under downwelling favourable winds follows a northward direction,\nfollowing the coastline, while for upwelling favourable winds, the observed flow directions is\nthe SW. This represents a confinement and expansion of the Tagus estuarine plume to and\nfrom the coast. In the absence of wind stress, the estuarine jet is controlled by the Coriolis\nforce with a rotation to the right of the flow and the plume propagation to the north. For\nall the analysed wind regimes, the buoyant plume dimensions were controlled by the river\ndischarge.\n\nIn order to evaluate the plume thickness, three cross-sections for salinity along the\nD3 domain were set. At same time, the horizontal velocity components were analysed.\nResults shown that with a river discharge of 5000 m3s?1, the estuary mouth region is\nfully dominated by estuarine waters in all wind regimes. The higher plume thickness was\nregistered under downwelling events, 15 m depth, being reduced with the wind rotation to\n\n\n\n57\n\nsouth (10 m). Horizontal currents show the quick response of the circulation to the wind\nrotation, specially in the region near shore. Under the plume bulge a persistent jet was\nobserved, with opposite direction to the plume propagation.\n\nIn overall, under downwelling events the plume is advected to the north, reaching, as far\nas, Peniche for a river discharge of 5000 m3s?1, while for a river discharge of 1500 m3s?1\n\nits excursion is limited to Cabo da Roca. Upwelling events shown a SW plume advection\nconfined to the Lisbon Bay for all the studied river discharge.\n\nEstuarine plumes are relevant to many coastal environments aspects, such as: biological\nproduction enhancement, primary production improving, costal pollution and geochemical\ntransport. Many of those factors have strong impact and are socio-economic important\nto the region population. As future work, the incorporation of a biogeochemical model\nis proposed. Recent news indicate that the Barreiro Harbour will be upgraded to an\nimportant harbour, expecting an increase of maritime traffic. That possibility, increases\nthe importance of the study of oil spills, being that a possible new module incorporation to\nthe model. An increase of the atmospheric model horizontal resolution could improve the\ncirculation predictions, especial in the mouth region of the estuary. The online coupling of\nthe estuarine and coastal application in a unique one, is also one of the future objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nAlcoforado, M. J. (1987).
