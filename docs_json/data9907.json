Based on \nclinical data, they were divided into three groups: 41 patients with evidence of liver fibrosis in \n2004 (Group 1); 102 patients with evidence of liver fibrosis in the past (1976-1989) but not \nin 2004 (Group 2); and 268 patients without evidence of liver fibrosis at any time during the \n27-year follow-up (Group 3). All of the patients underwent abdominal ultrasound in which \nthe examiner did not know the result from the clinical examination. The data were stored in a \ndatabase. Results: The prevalence of periportal fibrosis on ultrasound was 82.9%, 56.9% and \n13.4% in Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In the presence of hard, nodular liver or prominent \nleft lobe and a hard palpable spleen, ultrasound revealed periportal fibrosis in 70.9%. However, \nperiportal fibrosis was diagnosed using ultrasound in 25.4% of the patients in the absence of \nclinical evidence of liver involvement. Thus, ultrasound diagnosed periportal fibrosis 3.1 times \nmore frequently than clinical examination did. Conclusions: Although clinical examination \nis important in evaluating morbidity due to Manson\u2019s schistosomiasis in endemic areas, \nultrasound is more accurate in diagnosing liver involvement and periportal fibrosis. \nKey-words: Schistosomiasis.

M\u00e9todos: Em 2004, 411 pacientes de Brejo do Esp\u00edrito Santo, no estado da Bahia, ap\u00f3s \nconsentimento informado e por escrito foram selecionados para o presente estudo. Baseando-se no \nexame cl\u00ednico eles foram divididos em 3 grupos: 41 (Grupo 1) com evid\u00eancia de fibrose hep\u00e1tica \nno ano de 2004; 102 (Grupo 2) com evid\u00eancia de fibrose hep\u00e1tica no passado (1976-1989) mas \nn\u00e3o em 2004; e 268 (Grupo 3) sem evid\u00eancia de fibrose hep\u00e1tica em 27 anos de seguimento. \nTodos foram submetidos a exame ultrassonogr\u00e1fico do abdome em que o examinador n\u00e3o sabia \no resultado do exame cl\u00ednico.

Rupture of \nthese varices causes digestive hemorrhage, the most \nfrequent and feared complication of hepatosplenic \nManson\u2019s schistosomiasis. The hepatosplenic form is \nthe usual clinical counterpart of periportal fibrosis. \nIn clinical-epidemiological studies conducted in \nendemic areas, morbidity used to be evaluated only \non the basis of physical examination of the abdomen. \nHowever, there is no consensus about the clinical \nparameters of the liver and spleen that should be \nconsidered in the evaluation. Hepatomegaly and \nsplenomegaly have no uniform definition. The limit \nfor determining that an increase in liver volume has \noccurred remains a debatable issue. \n\nSome investigators consider hepatomegaly to be \npresent when the organ exceeds the costal margin \nby 5cm along the sternal line or by 4cm along the \nmidclavicular line2. Others accept enlargement to be \npresent if the liver is palpable 2cm below the costal \nmargin3 or simply if the liver is palpable4, without \nmentioning whether this organ is palpable at rest or \nduring inspiration. Yet other investigators attribute \nmore importance to liver characteristics such as hard \nconsistency, presence of nodules on the liver surface \nor prominence of the left lobe5. Regarding the spleen, \npalpability would be sufficient for some physicians6-8, \nwhereas others believe that the spleen should be \npalpable at the costal margin or beyond it9. Thus, \nthe diagnosis of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis varies \naccording to the different criteria mentioned.\n\nThe routine use of abdominal ultrasound \nexamination has been of great help in studying \nschistosomiasis because it enables identification \nof periportal fibrosis10-14. It also provides other \nimportant information such as sound evidence \nof portal hypertension and can measure or better \nestimate organ sizes15-18.\n\n\n\n130\n\nPrata A et al - Clinical and ultrasonograpic diagnosis of schistosomiasis mansoni in Brazil \n\nRESULTS\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe present study was designed to compare clinical and \nabdominal ultrasound findings in order to determine: a) whether \nclinical alterations suggestive of liver and/or spleen involvement \nin schistosomiasis are confirmed by ultrasound; b) the association \nbetween periportal fibrosis and other ultrasound findings; and c) the \nagreement between organ sizes measured by clinical examination \nand by ultrasound. \n\nStudy population \nA cross-sectional study was conducted in Brejo do Esp\u00edrito Santo \n\nin 2004, a rural community in the municipality of Santa Maria da \nVit\u00f3ria, Bahia; this area does not present malaria transmission but \nis considered hyperendemic for schistosomiasis. A total of 3,766 \npeople have been followed up since 1976 by means of clinical and \nfecal examinations (Kato-Katz technique)19, and control measures \nhave been implemented. \n\nPhysical examination\nThe same methodology for clinical evaluation was used on all \n\noccasions. The right hepatic lobe was examined on the anterior \naxillary line and the left lobe on the line through the xiphoid \nappendix. If it exceeded the costal margin, it was measured in \ncentimeters. When the liver was palpable, it was determined whether \nits consistency was flaccid (lip consistency), slightly hardened (nose \ntip consistency) or hard (bone consistency), and whether its surface \nwas smooth or nodular. Prominence of the left lobe was defined \nwhen this lobe was clearly larger than the right lobe5. The spleen was \npalpated and measured under the costal margin and its consistency \nwas determined. We defined splenomegaly as present only when \nthe spleen was palpable below the left costal margin. The following \nclinical forms were described: hepatointestinal (palpable liver), \nhepatointestinal with advanced hepatic lesions (at least one of the \nfollowing: hard, nodular or prominent left liver lobe), hepatosplenic \n(hepatointestinal with advanced liver lesions plus splenomegaly) and \npostsurgical hepatosplenic (histologically proven periportal fibrosis \nconfirmed during surgery)9.\n\nPatients with hepatosplenic or hepatointestinal schistosomiasis \nwith advanced hepatic lesions were assumed to have periportal \nfibrosis and therefore severe clinical disease9. Regarding hepatosplenic \npatients who under went surgery, only those with hard and/or \nnodular liver and/or prominent left lobe were assumed to have liver \nfibrosis. \n\nBased on clinical examinations performed by one of us (AP) \njust before the field visit of the present study (2004), the patients \nwho were invited to participate in this study were divided into three \ngroups: 41 patients with clinical evidence of liver disease (Group 1); \n102 patients with evidence of liver disease in the past (1976-1989) \nbut not in 2004 (Group 2); and 268 patients without evidence of liver \ndisease at any time during the 27-year follow-up (Group 3). \n\nAbdominal ultrasound \nThe abdominal ultrasound examination was performed using \n\na GE LOGIQ 100 instrument with a convex 3.5 MHz transducer. \nWe used indicators of periportal fibrosis proposed by the Niamey \nWorking Group (Niamey-Belo Horizonte classification)20,21. In \naccordance with this protocol, periportal fibrosis was classified \nin degrees (incipient, possible, probable, definite, advanced and \n\nadvanced with portal hypertension). The following other parameters \nwere also evaluated: hepatic contours, left lobe hypertrophy, right \nlobe atrophy, splenomegaly and thickening of the gallbladder wall. \nThe measurements (walls of the intrahepatic portal branches, caliber \nof the portal vein, left lobe, right lobe and spleen) were adjusted for \nthe patient's height16.\n\nStatistical analysis\n The data were analyzed using the SPSS program for Windows \n\n(Version 10.0; Copyright\u00ae SPSS Inc., 1989-1999). After performing \ndescriptive analysis of normality and homogeneity of variance, the \ndata were analyzed using the Student's t, Pearson and McNemar chi-\nsquare tests. Sensitivity and specificity were estimated. The kappa \n(k) concordance index was using as an estimate of reproducibility. \nIn all cases, the null hypothesis was rejected when a was less than \n5% (p &lt;0.05).\n\nEtical\nAll clinical, laborator y and ultrasound examinations were \n\nperformed following a masked protocol. The study protocol was \napproved by the Research Ethics Committees of the University of \nthe Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro, Federal University of Minas Gerais and the \nBrazilian National Research Ethics Committee (CONEP).\n\nA total of 411 patients were studied (199 men and 212 women). \nThe mean ages in years for groups 1, 2 and 3 were: 50.3 \u00b1 12.6, \n50.5 \u00b1 12.9 and 39.8 \u00b1 20.5, respectively. Group 3 volunteers were \nsignificantly younger than the individuals in groups 1 and 2. \n\nTable 1 shows that, from 1976 to 2004, there were marked \ndecreases in the prevalence of S. mansoni infection and in the parasitic \nload, as well as a significant decrease in the proportion of patients \nwith hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. \n\nIn Group 1, eight (19.5%) patients had hepatointestinal \nschistosomiasis with advanced liver lesions and 33 (80.5%) had \nhepatosplenic disease. Among the latter, 11 (33.3%) had undergone \nsplenectomy. The clinical findings are summarized in Table 2.\n\nAbdominal ultrasound\nPeriportal fibrosis was detected in 128 (31.1%) out of the 411 \n\nparticipants. Most of the patients with severe fibrosis were in Group \n1 (Figure 1). The mean ages for patients with and without fibrosis \nwere 52 and 34 years respectively (p &lt;0.01). There was no gender \ndifference. \n\nThe liver and spleen sizes of the different groups are presented in \nTable 3. Ultrasound showed irregular hepatic contours in 11 patients \n(3%) and gallbladder wall thickening in 114 (29.2%). \n\nConcordance between clinical and abdominal ultrasound \nexamination \n\nThere was no relation between palpable right (192/266) or \nleft (153/228) liver lobes and periportal fibrosis on ultrasound. \nPeriportal fibrosis was present in 50 (36.8%) of the 136 patients \nwith a non-palpable right lobe, and in 74 (27.8%) of the 266 with a \npalpable right liver lobe. Hence, periportal fibrosis was more frequent \nwhen the right liver lobe was non-palpable (p = 0.001). \n\nThere was a statistically significant association between presence \nof a palpable left liver lobe and periportal fibrosis (p = 0.001), and \n\n\n\n131\n\nRev Soc Bras Med Trop 43(2):129-134, mar-abr, 2010\n\nTABLE 1 - Prevalence of schistosomiasis, mean parasitic load (Schistosoma mansoni eggs per gram of feces) and percentage of \nclinical forms of schistosomiasis in different examinations, Brejo do Esp\u00edrito Santo, Bahia, Brazil.\n\n          Year of study\n\nSchistosoma mansoni infection and morbidity 1976 1980 1985 1989 2004\n\nSchistosoma mansoni prevalence (%) 75.2 60.7 44.5 15.2 1.8\n\n infection eggs per gram of feces (mean) 802.5 511.1 255.2 265.3 43.5\n\n hepatointestinal 86.2 67.5 92.3 87.6 94.3\n\nClinical forms HI* with advanced hepatic lesions 4.0 14.8 1.9 2.0 0.6\n\n hepatosplenic 8.0 10.7 4.3 2.5 1.7\n\n postsurgical hepatosplenic 0.6 1.0 1.1 0.8 2.1\n\n*HI: hepatointestinal.\n\nTABLE 2 - Clinical examination of the study groups,  Brejo do Esp\u00edrito Santo, State of Bahia, Brazil, 2004.\n\n                             Group 1               Group 2    Group 3\n\nClinical examination  no % no % no %\n\nRight lobe non-palpable 8  20 39 38,6 89  34,1\n\n palpable  32  80 62 61,4 172  65,9\n\nLeft lobe non palpable 1  2,4 46 45,1 126  48,8\n\n palpable  40  95,6 56 54,9 132 51,2\n\n flaccid 3  7,5 57 78,1 173 95,1\n\nHepatic consistency* slightly hardened 23  57,5 16  21,9 9  4,9\n\n hard 14  35 0 0 0 0\n\nHepatic surface* smooth 28  77,8 72 100 183 100\n\n nodular 8  22,2 0  0 0 0\n\nProminent left lobe* no 18  45 52  92,9 131 99,2\n\n yes 22  55 4  7,1*** 1 0,8***\n\n non palpable 5  16,1 64  75,3 183 69,6\n\nSpleen** palpable only with deep inspiration 10  32,3 20  23,5 75 28,5\n\n palpable at the costal margin or beyond 16  51,6 1  1,2 5 1,9\n\n flaccid 2  7,4 19  50 59 74,7\n\nSpleen consistency** slightly hardened 12  44,4 8  40 18 22,8\n\n hard 13  48,1 2  6,9 2 2,5\n\n* Excluding non-palpable patients, ** Excluding splenectomized patients, *** Doubtful.\n\nFIGURE 1 - Degrees of periportal fibrosis in the study groups, Brejo do Esp\u00edrito Santo,  State of Bahia, Brazil, \n2004.\n\n\n\n132\n\nTABLE 3 - Results from clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound and their relationship with periportal fibrosis and portal \nhypertension, Brejo do Esp\u00edrito Santo, State of Bahia, Brazil, 2004.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                          Fibrosis         Portal hypertension\n\n Evaluated parameter N  no % no  %\n\n right hepatic lobe non-palpable 136 50  36,8* 14 28\n\n left hepatic lobe beyond the costal margin 131 60  45,8* 26 43,3\n\n hardened liver 14 11  78,6* 5 45,4\n\nClinical examination nodular liver 8 7  87,5* 4 57,1\n\n prominent left hepatic lobe 27 19  70,4* 12 63,1\n\n spleen palpable only with deep inspiration 105 22  22,9* 10 9,5\n\n spleen at the costal margin or beyond 22 16  72,7* 15 93,8*\n\n hardened spleen 17 16  94,1* 14 87,5*\n\n right hepatic lobe atrophy 56 37  66,1* 17 46\n\nAbdominal ultrasound  left hepatic lobe enlargement 167 47  28,1 21 44,7\n\n splenomegaly 38 23  60,5* 20 87*\n\n irregular liver contours 11 11  100* 5 45,5\n\n thickening of the gallbladder wall 114 100  87,7* 37 37\n\n*Statistically significant.\n\nthis finding was more apparent in Group 1. Eleven (78.6%) out of the \n14 patients with a hardened liver, 32 (66.7%) out of the 46 patients \nwith a slightly hardened liver and 46 (19.7%) out of the 233 patients \nwith a flaccid liver had periportal fibrosis on ultrasound. Periportal \nfibrosis was also found in seven (87.5%) out of the eight patients with \nnodular liver and in 78 (27.6%) out of the 283 patients with smooth \nliver surface. Periportal fibrosis was detected in 19 (70.4%) out of \nthe 27 patients with a prominent left lobe and in 107 (28.5%) out of \nthe 375 patients without a prominent left lobe. All these differences \nwere statistically significant (p=0.001). These associations were not \nobserved with portal hypertension.\n\nPeriportal fibrosis was present in 61 (24.2%) out of the 252 \npatients with a non-palpable spleen, and in 24 (22.9%) of the 105 \npatients with a spleen that was only palpable during deep inspiration. \nInterestingly, 16 (72.7%) out of the 22 patients presenting enlarged \nspleen had periportal fibrosis (p<0.004) and portal hypertension \n(p<0.004). A hardened spleen was also associated with periportal \nfibrosis (16 out of 17 patients) and portal hypertension (14 out of \n17 patients) (p<0.001). \n\nIn Group 1, 34/41 (82.9%) showed periportal fibrosis on \nultrasound, and among them, 23 (67.7%) had portal hypertension. \nIn Group 2, 58/102 (56.9%) had periportal fibrosis, and 18 (31%) \nhad portal hypertension. In Group 3, 36/269 (13.4%) had periportal \nfibrosis and three (8.3%) had portal hypertension (Figure 1). Groups \n2 and 3 were pooled together and compared with Group 1, and this \nshowed that periportal fibrosis was significantly higher in Group 1 \n(p<0.001).  \n\nCompar ison bet ween other ultrasound f indings and \nperiportal fibrosis \n\nThirty-seven (66.1%) out of the 56 patients with right liver lobe \natrophy had periportal fibrosis, as opposed to 89 (25.5%) out of the \n349 patients with normal right liver lobe (p &lt;0.0001). This was not \nobserved for the left liver lobe. \n\nTwenty-three (60.5%) out of the 38 patients with splenomegaly \ndiagnosed using ultrasound had periportal fibrosis, as opposed to 84 (24.1%) \nout of the 348 without splenomegaly (p &lt;0.001). Splenomegaly was \nalso associated with portal hypertension (Table 3).\n\nIrregular hepatic contours and thickening of the gallbladder wall \nwere associated with periportal fibrosis (Table 3). A good agreement \nwas found between gallbladder wall thickening and periportal fibrosis \n(kappa = 0.8).\n\nComparison of liver and spleen size determined on clinical \nexamination and ultrasound \n\nTwenty-eight (50.9%) out of the 55 patients who had right \nliver lobe atrophy on ultrasound had a palpable liver. Conversely, \n50 (30.5%) out of the 164 patients with an enlarged left lobe on \nultrasound had a non-palpable left liver lobe. \n\nAmong the 125 patients with a palpable spleen, ultrasound \nconfirmed the presence of splenomegaly in 31 (24.8%). On the \nother hand, six (15.8%) out of the 38 patients with splenomegaly \non ultrasound had a non-palpable spleen. \n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPalpable right liver lobe and palpable spleen are not good indicators of \nperiportal fibrosis in field-based work. Among the cases of a prominent, \nhard nodular palpable liver, ultrasound revealed periportal fibrosis in \n70.9%. It is worth noting that periportal fibrosis occurred in 25.4% of \nthe patients without clinical evidence of liver involvement. In addition, \nultrasound diagnosed periportal fibrosis 3.1 times more frequently than \nclinical examination would suggest. Even in the cases with severe periportal \nfibrosis on ultrasound, with or without portal hypertension, ultrasound \ndiagnosed 2.1 times more cases than clinical examination did. \n\nRegarding the size of the right liver lobe, there was more fibrosis when \nthis lobe was non-palpable and even more when the lobe was found to \nbe atrophic by ultrasound, as has been previously reported2, 11.\n\nWith reference to the size of the left hepatic lobe, Houston et al22 \nobser ved that hepatomegaly showed high specificity (94%),  \nbut low (28%) sensitivity as a fibrosis marker. It is common \nknowledge that the liver size decreases with increasing degree of \nfibrosis15, 22-24. Doehring-Schwedtsfeger et al25 found no relationship \nbetween liver size and periportal fibrosis on ultrasound. In the present \nstudy, the association between left liver lobe beyond the costal margin \nand periportal fibrosis was important only for Group 1, when the left \n\nPrata A et al - Clinical and ultrasonograpic diagnosis of schistosomiasis mansoni in Brazil \n\n\n\n133\n\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT\n\nCONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFAPEMIG, CNPq and Federal University of Tri\u00e2ngulo Mineiro, Brasil\n\nlobe was also prominent. Thus, we do not think that increased left \nlobe size alone is a good clinical marker of hepatic fibrosis. When \nanalyzing left lobe hypertrophy on ultrasound, Cerri et al11 and \nKardorff et al2 detected correlation with portal fibrosis, a finding that \nwas not confirmed in our study.\n\nA distinction should be made between small and large spleen sizes. \nOnly in individuals with large spleens has a relationship with liver fibrosis \nbeen found. Thus, in endemic areas, the importance of small palpable \nspleens is uncertain; it may or may not be related to schistosomiasis \n(initial stages of the disease). Other causes of splenomegaly should be \ninvestigated, as reported by Lambertucci et al26.\n\nIn our study, we also detected a relationship between clinical \nsplenomegaly and the WHO fibrosis patterns25,27-32. In addition, \npatients with severe periportal fibrosis without splenomegaly were \nalso found30,33. Splenomegaly diagnosed using ultrasound was related \nboth to the presence of the WHO patterns and of periportal fibrosis, \nas already described11,20.\n\nThe liver was found by ultrasound to have irregular contours in \nindividuals who had current or past clinical evidence suggestive of \nperiportal fibrosis. However, the absence of irregular contours did \nnot rule out periportal fibrosis. Their presence, as well as gallbladder \nwall thickening, correlated with periportal fibrosis but not with portal \nhypertension. This finding has been reported before 2,14,20,25. In one \nstudy, the finding of gallbladder wall thickening was also suggestive \nof non-reversal of liver fibrosis31.\n\nNo agreement was found between ultrasound and clinical \nexamination regarding organ size, as already reported 34. One \nadvantage of the Niamey\u2013Belo Horizonte protocol is the adjustment \nof the measurements to the patients\u2019 height21. Nonetheless, we \noccasionally still detected periportal thickening or dilatation of the \nportal vein in individuals with no qualitative signs of fibrosis on \nultrasound (WHO patterns). \n\nAlthough ultrasound is superior to clinical examination for \ndetection of periportal fibrosis, it does not allow evaluation of \nimportant data such as liver and spleen consistency. On the other \nhand, the subjectivity of clinical examination was unexpectedly \ndemonstrated in the present study: the prevalence of hepatointestinal \nschistosomiasis with advanced liver disease increased from 4% in \n1976 to 14.8% in 1980 and that of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis from \n8% to 10.7% (Table 1). After a careful investigation, it was noted that \na different physician was responsible for the clinical examination in \nthe study area in 1980.\n\nBrejo do Esp\u00edrito Santo has not been a hyperendemic area for \nschistosomiasis since the implementation of control measures, which \nstarted in 1976. The current clinical and ultrasound findings, many \nof them slight and some in a regression phase, represent the sequelae \nfrom lesions that previously were severe. These were established in the \npast when S. mansoni transmission was high. The implementation of \neffective measures has changed the disease profile in this area, along \nwith the emergence of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis. However, it \nis important to emphasize that severe disease persists even after \nachieving a good control of transmission31.\n\nIn conclusion, although clinical examination is still important in \nevaluating morbidity due to Manson\u2019s schistosomiasis in endemic \nareas, ultrasound is more accurate in diagnosing liver involvement \nand periportal thickening.\n\n1.
