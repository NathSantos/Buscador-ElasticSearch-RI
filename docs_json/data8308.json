Therefore, it \n\ndisplays economic, class, gender, religious, and ethnic inequalities. Libya gained \n\nindependence from Italy in 1951. The country became The United Kingdom of Libya, \n\na constitutional and hereditary monarchy. After the discovery of oil reserves and a \n\nlarge income from petroleum sales, Libya established as a wealthy nation.\t\n \u00a0However, \n\ndiscontent arises with the concentration of the country\u2019s wealth in the power sphere.  \n\nOn September of 1969, a group of military officers led by Muammar Gaddafi launch \n\nLibyan Revolution and deposing the king Idris. The constitution was abolished and \n\npolicies were outlined in the \"Green Book\" - a proposal of Gaddafi to improve and \n\ndevelop the country. Keeping Libya debt-free, the government improved the income \n\nper capita and increased the ranking of the country in the Human Development Index \n\nto the higher in Africa. However, since the 1970s most of the oil profits was spent on \n\narms and supporting terrorist groups. Without any elections or democratic nature, in \n\n1977 Libya became \"Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\" and Gaddafi \n\ngot unlimited power. In 1986 there was a failed assassination attempt against Gaddafi \n\nand shortly thereafter, Libya was under UN sanctions. \n\nThe \u201cPermanent Revolution\u201d of Gaddafi has been characterized by its brutality and \n\nextravagance. The dictator prohibited private ownership and retail trade, banned \n\npress, controlled the military, implemented the sharia and pursued dissidents. Libya\u2019s \n\ndecades of international isolation left the country without no political alliances or \n\nnational organizations of any kind. Libyan society has been fractured, divided by the \n\ncleavages of kinship and region. In recent years, Gaddafi went from anti-Western \n\nterrorist dictator into a semi-Western ally in the global war against terrorism and \n\nfundamentalist Islamism. \n\n \n\nThe Arab Spring \n\nAt the beginning of the year 2011, revolutions in several Arab countries were \n\nhighlighted in the worldwide media agenda. Social media played an important role in \n\nthese political changes. The \"Arab Spring\" hit Tunisia, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Libya, \n\nJordan, Morocco, Algeria, Yemen, Oman and Djibouti. The Internet and social media \n\nwere considered as determinant. Social media applications such as Facebook, Twitter, \n\n\n\nYouTube or Flickr have been identified as key to the revolution in the Arab world. \n\nThese platforms were the epicenter of Arab regional social media innovation and help \n\nbuilt communities. \n\nThe labels \"Twitter Revolution\" and \"Facebook Revolution\" fulfilled many \n\nnewspaper titles. However, demographic issues as well as social and political patterns \n\nbetween countries were very diverse. Compare substantially different economies and \n\ncultures become habitual although created fallacies. Activists and opposition of \n\ndictatorial governments used technology to share ideas and disseminate their message. \n\nNevertheless, the main issue is that these uses resonated in different ways in the local \n\ncontexts and in the global sphere. Therefore, was the social media a facilitator of the \n\nrevolution? There is no consensual answer. Yet it became clear that the political \n\ndevelopments in the Arab showed that the youth used the Internet as a political \n\nplatform and a tool to mobilize people for change.  \n\nThe use of platforms such as Facebook and Twitter highlighted the shift from social \n\ntools to political tools. Not only in the Arab world but mainly in the Arabian \n\nDiaspora. Through social media, the Diasporas have been instrumental to the change. \n\nHowever, broadcast media have not been redundant in the revolutionary processes. \n\nThe role of Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya channels television were also very important.  \n\nAs Libyan regime was based on a society fractured into clan\u2019s networks, armed rebels \n\nignited the protests within the eastern provinces. The first manifestations in Libya \n\nbegan on February 15th 2011 and in the following days more than a dozen protesters \n\nwere killed in confrontations with pro-Gaddafi tribes and secret police. The \n\ndemonstrations hostile to government intransigence and brutal repression against \n\nprotesters degenerated in a revolt that spread rapidly through the eastern part of the \n\ncountry, traditionally opposed to Gaddafi. In April 2011, the New York Times \n\nreported that two of the sons of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi attempted to \n\narticulate a transition to a constitutional democracy that would include the step-down \n\nof the father from power. The transition would be conducted by one of Gaddafi's sons, \n\nSaif al-Islam Gaddafi. The rebels, however, rejected the proposal. NATO took the \n\ncommand of military operations in Libya. The decision was taken unanimously by \n\nmember states of the organization, after several days of tough negotiations on \n\nNATO's role and its ability to perform or not air strikes on ground targets.  \n\nEven with the declared defeat of pro-Gaddafi forces and complete occupation of the \n\nterritories, Saif al-Islam remained in hiding in the south of the country until his \n\n\n\ncapture in November 2011. In addition, members of the former government escaped \n\nto Niger, despite the violence when they were detected by troops from that country. \n\n \n\nRole of Social Media \n\nAlthough digital migration is still in it early years in Libya, the use of social media for \n\nexternal dissemination of protests revealed the tribal and regional cleavages in the \n\ncountry. In Libya, the Internet penetration rate was quite low: only 5.4% of the \n\npopulation had access in June 2010 and in March 2011, only 1.1% had created \n\naccount on Facebook. These numbers demonstrate how is not possible to argue that \n\nsocial media has been the main impulse of the uprising in Libya. From an internal \n\nperspective, the numbers demystify the idea of \u201cFacebook Revolution\" or \"Twitter \n\nRevolution\".  \n\nNumerous Facebook pages and hundreds of thousands of tweets supported the protest. \n\nMoreover, the role of mobile devices has been significantly important, both in \n\nmessaging and for conveying information across the Internet. On 18 February, the \n\nregime has disabled the Internet hoping to smother manifestations. Nevertheless, on \n\nthe contrary, they increase, culminating in bloody clashes between rebels and loyal to \n\nGadhafi. As social media encouraged the free expression, Gaddafi\u2019s regime replied \n\nwith brutal repression and arrests. As a consequence, the rise of an independent social \n\nmedia in the Diaspora resulted in an increasing of citizen engagement within \n\ncommunication technologies. Therefore, social media also were used as \u201cwatchdog\u201d \n\nof official Libyan press and disseminated information to the Western world. Several \n\nTwitter campaigns were directed to public figures and against political actors in \n\nLibya. In the same perspective, the Libyan government also tried to resist and become \n\nactive particularly on Twitter. The second son of Gaddafi, Saif al-Islam, also tried to \n\nuse social media for spreading his message to the international community and \n\npresent his determination to govern Libya and move the country toward democracy. \n\nAs the revolution has several social and political actors, it became clear the \n\nappropriation of the technique as a method of propaganda. \u201cThe YouTube war\u201d \n\nexposed the uses of social media platforms for the purposes of political dissident and \n\nactivist organizations. There were many suspicions as to the contents published and \n\nconfirmation of information was increasingly difficult, with armed rebels on the \n\nground to hinder the work of media professionals. The propaganda war has become \n\nevident in video content but also in fake pages created on Facebbok and false \n\n\n\ninformation disseminated on Twitter. The different streams in social media caused \n\nmany questions about the veracity of what was actually happening in the country. \n\nJournalists and bloggers faced serious repercussions for expressing independent \n\nopinion and publishing reliable and impartial information. Several social media \n\ncampaigns demanded rights for Internet users, journalists, citizen journalists and \n\nbloggers. The Gaddafi regime severely repressed digital dissidents. The \n\nimprisonments were emblematic for a control of digital space. Hence Libyan \n\nDiaspora has often been the source of information of what was happening inside the \n\ncountry for the outside world and international audiences. In fact, Libyan youth \n\nmovement in the Diaspora reported directly to Twitter and Facebook and tagged the \n\nmessages with the hashtag #feb17. \n\nAs Tripoli collapsed into a civil war, social media were used for empower the \n\nrevolution as well as to place the message into a transnational sphere. On Twitter, \n\nusers from around the world tagged tweets with the hashtag #feb17 as an international \n\ndemonstration of solidarity for the pro-democracy protests. The media professionals \n\ndialogued directly with users through these streams and relied to the techniques of \n\nsemantic classification to remain at the forefront of publishing content and attracting \n\naudiences. \n\nThe new tools implemented different (simple and, simultaneously, complex) social \n\nobjects that promoted new practices: to subscribe, to like, to retweet, to digg, to \n\nshare\u2026 This means that users\u2019 online behavior can be studied as an activity. \n\nTherefore, social practices can be labeled as the lead to social action and to social \n\ninteraction. The role of hashtags in Libyan revolution was relevant as it promoted \n\nadherence to social and political movements, ensured information streams, indexed \n\nmessages to contents and disseminated information by communication channels that \n\npromote collective action through social interactions. Social media and social \n\npractices of semantic web advertised the revolution as a whole organized and created \n\nties that sustained communities and mobilized civic action. \n\nThe NATO intervention in Lybia was also an issue that has been much discussed in \n\nsocial networks and led the rebels to impose severe punishments to critics. What \n\nseemed like a revolution for democracy began to cause questions in social networks \n\nand in the Libyan youth movement in the Diaspora. \n\nAfter five months of being blocked, by August 2011, the Internet was available again \n\nto the Libyan public. The capture of Gaddafi and his death at the hands of the rebels \n\n\n\nseemed to put an end to civil war, in October 2011. Though Libya is currently \n\nundergoing on a political reconstruction, widespread corruption and scarcity of basic \n\ngoods still occur. The main issue is state formation and not only democratization. The \n\n6.4 million people in Libya are still living fearing a war and divided among the \n\ndifferent provinces. The rebels took the power but democracy was not declared and \n\nsocial media continue to be a support to expose what is happening in the country. As \n\nmedia professionals began to redirect attention to the Syria, social platforms have \n\nbecome the only medium to disseminate information on the real situation in Libya. \n\nThe youth in the Diaspora returned to play an important role after the disillusionment \n\nwith the fall of Tripoli to the rebels. \n\nThe opposition to Gaddafi who took power understood the role of network and \n\nsatellites. Internet cuts aim to end communications with the outside world. Yet the \n\nattempts were frustrated because users can get to Twitter via SMS and virtual private \n\nnetworks and proxy servers that allow secure remote access to external networks. \n\nAttempts to limit communications with the outside world not only failed as it \n\nhighlights in social media that there is another need for change.  \n\nSocial media continued to play an important role at this stage in the disclosure of the \n\ncountry situation and the evolution and social revolt. After the elections in July 2012, \n\nthe new leaders of the country have difficulty imposing his authority over the rebel \n\nbrigades who fought the Gaddafi regime in 2011. Some militias believe that their \n\nlegitimacy is stronger than that of elected officials. The population responded by \n\norganizing demonstrations and managed to oust Islamist groups. Through the Internet \n\nand social media, Amnesty International reported that although most human rights \n\nviolations had occurred by the forces of the deposed regime, supporters of the new \n\nregime would also be involved in torture and murder. Facebook pages and Twitter \n\ncontinue to have a very significant impact on the disclosure of internal information of \n\nthe country, often replacing the media professionals. Moreover, social media started \n\nto be complementary to satellite TV that is assumed to be partial. Bloggers and citizen \n\njournalists continue to be harassed and Internet access is still controlled by the \n\nauthorities and militias, according to Reporters Without Borders and Amnesty \n\nInternational. \n\nThe critical mass of Twitter, mostly Western, considers unacceptable this kind of \n\npressure on citizens and condemned the way Gaddafi was executed. The trial of the \n\nson of the dictator, prisons and repression of digital dissident are now the most \n\n\n\ndiscussed topics in social media. Despite the hashtag #feb17 refer to February 2011 \n\nand the beginning of the revolution, it continues to be used to index content on the \n\nLibyan situation. \n\nThe use of social media cannot be interpreted as a direct cause that induced changes \n\nin Libya. Cyberspace was the link between different networks and established new \n\npublic spheres for debate. Digital media has individualized, localized and structured a \n\ncollective consciousness. Within this new news ecosystem, political uses of social \n\nmedia were also exposed.  Social media don\u2019t generate revolutions but may facilitate \n\nthem and aided political actors to transform their public image. Nevertheless, social \n\nmedia can change the nature of news, just as Arab satellite channels helped to \n\nbroadcast the revolution."}]}}}
