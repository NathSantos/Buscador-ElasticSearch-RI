The velocity of shear waves (??) were obtained from the Rayleigh \n\nwave\u2019s dispersion. The present document reports the acquisition and processing of 28 seismic profiles \n\n(approximately 3225 m for MASW data) acquired between March and July 2015. In the acquisition, a \n\nlinear array of 24 geophones spaced by 1.2 m was used for the active measurements. Since the method \n\nuses vertical impulse (PEG 40 and sledge hammer) and vertical recording, it was also possible to \n\ndetermine the compressional wave velocities derived from refraction analysis, using the Rayfract \n\nSeismic Refraction &amp; Borehole Tomography\u00ae software. The 2D compressional wave models were used \n\nto infer the thickness/ geometry of the layers, as well as preliminary input for MASW data processing \n\n/modeling, since applying an a priori model minimizes the dispersion of the final results. The processing \n\nconsists of two main stages: imaging dispersion curves of surface waves and the estimation of near-\n\nsurface shear-wave velocity by inversion of Rayleigh waves. Finally, a 2D S-wave velocity section was \n\ngenerated due to the CMP roll-along acquisition format. For the gridding process, the Golden Software's \n\nSurfer\u00ae was used, placing each S-wave profile (?? versus depth) in the middle of the seismic spread with \n\nwhich it was calculated. Finally, each line was placed in its location and represented Voxler 3 3D \n\nsoftware\u00ae, allowing a better perception of the distribution of the dynamic properties of the soil along \n\nthe landfill. Shear wave velocities (VS) generally increase with depth, but they can differ due to site \n\nconditions, water content, tide levels, landfill operation procedures, like compaction made on site, \n\namong others.  \n\n \n\nKey-words: MASW, Surface Waves, Shear waves, Landfill \n\n \n\nResumo (resumo em Portugu\u00eas) \n\n \nCom este trabalho pretende-se determinar a velocidade das ondas de cisalhamento (??) num aterro \n\natrav\u00e9s do m\u00e9todo da an\u00e1lise multicanal de ondas de superf\u00edcie (MASW), estimando \n\nconsequentemente as propriedades din\u00e2micas do solo. A velocidade das ondas de cisalhamento (??) \n\nforam obtidas a partir da dispers\u00e3o das ondas de Rayleigh. \n\nO presente documento relata a aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o e processamento de 28 perfis s\u00edsmicos adquiridos entre \n\nMar\u00e7o e Julho de 2015. Na aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o foi usado um conjunto de 24 geofones verticais com uma \n\nfrequ\u00eancia natural de 10 Hz. Os recetores estavam ligados entre si com um espa\u00e7amento de 1,2 m, \n\nsendo deslocados em conjunto 4.8 m ap\u00f3s a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de um par de tiros. Por cada posi\u00e7\u00e3o foram \n\nrealizados 2 tiros, com diferentes dist\u00e2ncias ao primeiro geofone, 2.4 e 9.6 m, mas apenas o tiro mais \n\nafastado (9.6 m) foi usado para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o das ondas S com o m\u00e9todo MASW. De acordo com as \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es do s\u00edtio, a fonte utilizada foi a PEG-40 ou um martelo. \n\nUma vez que o m\u00e9todo utiliza um impulso vertical e rece\u00e7\u00e3o vertical, tamb\u00e9m foi poss\u00edvel determinar \n\na velocidade das ondas longitudinais (VP), derivadas da an\u00e1lise de refra\u00e7\u00e3o usando o software Rayfract \n\nSeismic Refraction &amp; Borehole Tomography \u00ae. Para este m\u00e9todo, ambos os tiros com diferentes \n\ndist\u00e2ncias foram usados para a an\u00e1lise das ondas refratadas. Os modelos de ondas de compress\u00e3o 2D \n\nforam utilizados para aferir a espessura e n\u00famero de camadas, como modelo preliminar para o \n\nprocessamento em MASW. A inser\u00e7\u00e3o de um modelo a priori permite uma melhor modela\u00e7\u00e3o da curva \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nde dispers\u00e3o ao espectro de velocidades, minimizando assim a dispers\u00e3o dos resultados ap\u00f3s a \n\ninvers\u00e3o. \n\nPara a inser\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados no software Rayfract Seismic Refraction &amp; Borehole Tomography, todas as \n\ndist\u00e2ncias e posicionamentos inerentes \u00e0 aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o tiveram de ser convertidos em n\u00fameros de \n\nesta\u00e7\u00f5es, utilizando como unidade de medida a dist\u00e2ncia entre geofones. Estabeleceu-se como \n\nesta\u00e7\u00e3o 0 a posi\u00e7\u00e3o do geofone mais pr\u00f3ximo do tiro (G1). \n\nPara a obten\u00e7\u00e3o dos modelos 2D da velocidade das ondas compressivas, foram picadas as primeiras \n\nchegadas.  \n\nPosteriormente, criou-se um modelo de camadas baseado no modelo de ondas refratadas para a \n\nan\u00e1lise das ondas superficiais. O processamento das ondas superficiais consiste basicamente em duas \n\netapas principais: (1) obten\u00e7\u00e3o do espectro de velocidades, que corresponde \u00e0 dispers\u00e3o da energia \n\nrelacionando a frequ\u00eancia com a velocidade de fase. Neste espectro de velocidades podem-se \n\ndistinguir diversos modos de propaga\u00e7\u00e3o das ondas superficiais, no entanto s\u00f3 o modo fundamental \n\nfoi picado; Posteriormente segue-se (2) a estimativa da velocidade de cisalhamento atrav\u00e9s da \n\ninvers\u00e3o do modelo a priori criado. Finalmente, os perfis 2D da velocidade das ondas s foram gerados \n\ndevido \u00e0 aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o em s\u00e9rie realizada. Para o processo de interpola\u00e7\u00e3o espacial, utilizou-se o Golden \n\nSoftware Surfer\u00ae, onde cada perfil vertical ?? foi representado no meio dos 24 geofones, entre o 12\u00ba \n\ne o 13\u00ba. \n\nCom o m\u00e9todo MASW produziram-se cerca de 695 perfis verticais 1D para as ondas S, perfazendo um \n\ncomprimento total de 3225 m. Na refra\u00e7\u00e3o, para o c\u00e1lculo da velocidade das ondas P, foram utilizados \n\n1396 tiros, resultando num comprimento total de 4267 m. \n\nFinalmente, cada modelo 2D de velocidade das ondas S foi representada por um software 3D - Voxler \n\n3, permitindo assim uma melhor perce\u00e7\u00e3o da das propriedades din\u00e2micas do solo ao longo do aterro. \n\nAtrav\u00e9s da disposi\u00e7\u00e3o dos modelos verifica-se que o substrato rochoso vai ficando mais profundo \u00e0 \n\nmedida que se aproxima do mar, sendo tamb\u00e9m vis\u00edvel que a espessura de sedimentos do aterro \u00e9 \n\nmaior junto \u00e0 costa do que para o seu interior. Fazendo um balan\u00e7o geral, as linhas adquiridas em \n\n\u00e9pocas diferentes apresentam velocidades diferentes nos sedimentos do aterro, nomeadamente os \n\nperfis adquiridos em Mar\u00e7o apresentam velocidades cisalhantes inferiores aos adquiridos em Junho e \n\nJulho. Este facto pode dever-se \u00e0 \u00e1gua presente no solo derivada da \u00e9poca das chuvas, que ocorre em \n\nMar\u00e7o. Ademais, os perfis mais pr\u00f3ximos da costa apresentam velocidades inferiores a todos os outros \n\nperfis, independentemente da data de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o, e da energia de compacta\u00e7\u00e3o inerente ao local. A \n\nvelocidade das ondas de cisalhamento (??) tende a aumentar com a profundidade, mas pode diferir \n\ncom as condi\u00e7\u00f5es do local, mais precisamente com a presen\u00e7a de \u00e1gua decorrente das chuvas ou da \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel de mar\u00e9s. As heterogeneidades na compacta\u00e7\u00e3o de aterros tamb\u00e9m podem \n\ninfluenciar a sua velocidade.  \n\nNeste trabalho, as invers\u00f5es de velocidades podem ser vistas em todos os modelos 2D da velocidade \n\ndas ondas S, entre os 0 m (MSL) at\u00e9 \u00e0 base rochosa. Esta invers\u00e3o encontra-se na mesma cota do n\u00edvel \n\nfre\u00e1tico e reflete, provavelmente, as varia\u00e7\u00f5es das mar\u00e9s. Esta camada de baixa velocidade acima do \n\nsubstrato rochoso, em ocasi\u00f5es de chuvas intensas, pode tornar ainda mais baixa a resist\u00eancia ao \n\ncisalhamento.  \n\nPara uma an\u00e1lise mais aprofundada da velocidade das ondas S, foram escolhidos tr\u00eas perfis: L01, L02 \n\ne L06 de modo a compar\u00e1-los entre si. No L02, fez-se um levantamento das mar\u00e9s referentes aos 2 \n\ndias de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o, com o objetivo de analisar o efeito das mar\u00e9s na velocidade das ondas s. Nesta \n\nan\u00e1lise foi vis\u00edvel a mudan\u00e7a de mar\u00e9 que existia entre os dois dias de aquisi\u00e7\u00e3o. Posteriormente, \n\nrealizou-se uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o entre os perfis L01 e L02 de modo a perceber a influ\u00eancia da \u00e9poca das \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nchuvas no comportamento do aterro. Feita a compara\u00e7\u00e3o, foi poss\u00edvel verificar que L01, adquirida em \n\nMar\u00e7o, atingia uma velocidade m\u00ednima na invers\u00e3o de 245 m/s, enquanto L02, adquirida em Junho, \n\natingia uma velocidade m\u00ednima de 293 m/s, mesmo estando o perfil L02 situado numa zona de maior \n\nenergia de compacta\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nPor fim compararam-se dois perfis adquiridos na mesma \u00e9poca, mas que se localizavam em zonas com \n\ndiferentes energias de compacta\u00e7\u00e3o: L01 e L06. As velocidades m\u00ednimas atingidas na camada de \n\ninvers\u00e3o n\u00e3o diferem significativamente, sendo em L06,  ?????=217 m/s. No entanto, apesar da \n\nenergia de compacta\u00e7\u00e3o do local onde L06 foi adquirida ser muito superior \u00e0 do local onde a linha 01 \n\nfoi adquirida, as velocidades cisalhantes do aterro n\u00e3o se apresentam superiores no modelo 2D obtido. \n\nPossivelmente a proximidade \u00e0 costa e consequente influ\u00eancia da \u00e1gua, tenha maior impacto na \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00e3o da velocidade do que a energia de compacta\u00e7\u00e3o. No entanto \u00e9 poss\u00edvel verificar no perfil L06, \n\numa mudan\u00e7a de velocidade entre as zonas com diferentes energias de compacta\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nRelativamente a an\u00e1lise do ??30, todos os modelos apresentam valores superiores a 360 m/s, o que \n\nclassifica o solo como muito denso ou como rocha \u201cmacia\u201d, no entanto os perfis s\u00e3o muito \n\nheterog\u00e9neo sentre si..  \n\nPara uma melhor avalia\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados e classifica\u00e7\u00e3o do terreno, seria vantajoso realizar uma s\u00e9rie de \n\nan\u00e1lises ao aterro depois de compactado, como perfura\u00e7\u00e3o, ensaios in situ, SPT, amostragem e os \n\nensaios de laborat\u00f3rio. Estas an\u00e1lises possibilitariam uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o da velocidade das ondas S com \n\nmodelos emp\u00edricos utilizando os ensaios SPT. Inclusive, o c\u00e1lculo do modo de distor\u00e7\u00e3o seria mais \n\nveross\u00edmil caso fossem disponibilizados valores da densidade. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: MASW, Ondas superficiais, Ondas S, Aterros\n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \ni \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\nTable of Contents \n \n\n1.

Introduction \n\nDuring my internship in the company: Geosurveys Portugal \u2013 Geophysical Consultants, I had the \n\nchance to do my thesis with the data obtained on a MASW Survey realized on a company project. \n\nRegarding that fact, the location and identification of the survey area are confidential. During this \n\nwork, I establish a method to get reliable results from the multichannel analysis of surface waves, \n\nwhich include a previous refraction analysis. \n\n \n\n1.1. Soil characterizations \n\nThe geomechanical characterization of the shallow layers is very importante to understand the \n\nlocation in study. The near surface P and S-wave seismic velocities provide valuable information for \n\nstudies of ground motion behavior. [Carvalho et al., 2009; Akin et al., 2011] Where the shear wave \n\nvelocity is a fundamental parameter required to define the dynamic properties of soils. It is useful in \n\nthe evaluation of foundation stiffness, earthquake site response, liquefaction potential, soil density, \n\nsite classification, soil stratigraphy and foundation settlements. [Akin et al., 2011] There are several \n\nmethods for estimating shear waves, such as borehole logging, seismic reflection profiles or surface \n\nwave\u2019s inversion. [Carvalho et al., 2009] However, shear wave velocities of soil profiles are most \n\naccurately determined using in-situ seismic measurements because in-situ measurements involve very \n\nlow strain levels, and the measured values can be used to obtain the maximum shear modulus (????) \n\nat a particular depth in a soil deposit. The small strain shear modulus, ???? is an important parameter \n\nin seismic analyses of landfills and is also related to the compressibility of municipal solid waste. It can \n\nbe calculated using elasticity theory through the following equation: [Akin et al., 2011; \n\nHanumantharao, C., &amp; Ramana, G. V., 2008] \n\n???? = ???\n2 \n\nIn the absence of a soil's density value it can be assumed, since slight variation of density has a small \n\ninfluence in the estimated value. [Hanumantharao, C., &amp; Ramana, G. V., 2008] \n\n \n\n1.2. Refraction surveying \n\nThe P-wave refraction survey was conducted mainly for the geometrical characterization of the \n\nstructures of the landfill. The very shallow water table limits the P-wave velocity variations in the \n\nsaturated soft sediments, and the primary objective of the test was the identification of the base of \n\nthe soft sediments. The acquisition geometry was designed considering the desired investigation \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n2 \n\n   \n\n  \n\ndepth. Long spreads for P-wave refraction were used to achieve greater investigation depth and \n\nidentify possible lithological boundaries below the water table and lateral variation. \n\n \n\n1.3.  Refraction method \n\nThe seismic refraction is a fast, efficient and non-invasive method. This method is based on the \n\ngeneration of seismic P waves that propagates on the subsoil and refract in the interfaces with \n\nincreasing propagation velocities in depth, and with sufficiently different elastic characteristics. The \n\nmajor limitation of this method is that it cannot identify a low speed layer in the middle of two layers \n\nwith higher speeds. Which means that the velocity of propagation of P-waves has always to increase \n\nin depth. [Redpath, 1973]. \n\n \n\n1.4. MASW surveying \n\nThe software winMASW\u00ae allows analyzing seismic data to determine the vertical profile of the shear \n\nwaves. The MASW method is based on the phenomenon of dispersion study of surface waves. [Neves \n\net al., 2014] \n\n \n\n1.5. Surface Waves \n\nThe surface waves result from the interaction between P and S waves when they reach a surface. These \n\npropagate along the surface, decreasing its amplitudes almost exponentially when they go deeper. \n\nThe surface wave are dispersive, i.e. different frequencies propagate with different speeds, known as \n\nphase velocity. (Neves et al., 2014) \n\nMainly, there are two types of surface waves: Rayleigh and Love waves. In this thesis only the Rayleigh \n\nwaves will be discussed. Surface wave methods are especially appealing in measuring ?? in landfills, \n\nbecause they are non-intrusive method. The shear wave velocities can be derived from inverting the \n\ndispersive phase velocity of surface waves using a process called multichannel analysis of surface \n\nwaves (MASW). (Xia et al., 2004) \n\n \n\n1.5.1. MASW Processing \n\nMASW estimates S-wave velocity from multichannel vertical component data. It consists in three parts: \n\n1) data acquisition; 2) dispersion-curve picking and 3) Inversion. Furthermore, a 2D S-wave velocity \n\nsection can be generated when surface wave data are acquired in a standard CMP roll along acquisition \n\nformat. \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n3 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 1- MASW Processing sequence. [Xia et al., 2014] \n\n? Surface-wave data acquisition   \n\nThe type of surface waves acquired depends on the source, direction of impact and geophones \n\norientation. When the source is a vertical impact and geophones are vertical component, the surface \n\nwaves analyzed are Rayleigh. The maximum penetration depth in a homogeneous medium is about \n\none wavelength [Elisoft \u2013 geophysical software and services, 2015]. The currently accepted rule of \n\nthumb for the maximum penetration depth is approximately half the longest wavelength. Normally, \n\nthe longer the geophone spread, the higher the resolution of the dispersion image. To avoid spatial \n\naliasing, the receiver spacing should be less than half the shortest measured wavelength.  \n\n? Dispersion curves of surface waves on multi-channel record. \n\nIn this step, proceeds to the picking of the dispersion curve in the F-V domain or F-K domain. The \n\nconversion is made through the relation: ? =\n?\n\n?\n, where ? is the phase velocity associated to the \n\nfrequency ? and wave number ?. [Dal Moro et al., 2003] ? ? ? spectrum consists in an image \n\nrepresenting the energy density. This image uses the colour intensity to show the amplitudes of the \n\ndata at different frequency and wave-number components. Moreover, as the wave field is only \n\ncharacterized by Rayleigh waves, it is possible to see several propagation modes, reliable separated; \n\nwhich is possible only through a multi-channel recording method combined with an appropriate multi-\n\nchannel data-processing technique [Tselentis &amp; Delis , 1998]. Such curves are later used for the \n\ninversion process, which eventually provides subsurface information of use in geological or \n\ngeotechnical applications [Dal Moro et al., 2003] \n\n? Inversion of dispersion curves of surface waves \n\nThe Rayleigh-wave phase velocity of a layered earth model is a function of frequency and four earth \n\nproperties: P-wave velocity (??), S-wave velocity (??), density (?), and thickness of layers (?).  \n\n?(?, ?, ??, ??, ?, ?) = 0 \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n4 \n\n   \n\n  \n\nWhere ? is the frequency in Hz, ? is the Rayleigh wave phase velocity at frequency ?. \n\nAnalysis of the Jacobian matrix provides a measure of dispersion-curve sensitivity to these earth \n\nproperties where shear-wave velocity is the dominant influence on a dispersion curve in the high-\n\nfrequency range (>2 Hz), therefore only S-wave velocities are considered unknowns in the inversion. \n\n[Xia et al., 1999]  \n\nThe disadvantage of the inversion method is the non-uniqueness of the solutions, namely the \n\npossibility of obtaining many layers, relatively close to the solution, which satisfy the observed data. \n\nFor this method to be applied successfully, it is necessary to restrict some parameters, like establishing \n\nan initial starting model for the inversion process, to minimize the dispersion of the final result. This \n\ninitial model might be defined using the layer thicknesses obtained by other seismic the methods, like \n\nrefraction for example. [Neves et al., 2014] \n\nHowever, in the processing software used, the method used for the inversion of the dispersive curve \n\nis based on an optimization process (genetic algorithms) [Dal Moro, 2007).] This method implemented \n\na two-step inversion, the first one starts with several preliminary \u201cparallel\u201d runs and the second one \n\nuses the previously determined fittest model as starting population. (Figure 2)  \n\n \nFigure 2- Genetic Algorithms sequence for surface wave analysis \n\nThe key element for any kind of optimization is the model evaluation, which is performed by means of \n\nan objective function that allows a quantitive estimation of the model. For that it\u2019s considered the RMS \n\nvalue of the difference between the observed and calculated phase velocities, i.e. the dispersion curve. \n\n????????? ???????? = ??\n?

[Xia et al., 2004] \n\n \n\n1.6. S- waves \n\n \n\n??,30 can be estimated using existing ?? measurements. The results in terms of ??,?  i.e. time-average \n\nshear wave velocity in the topmost z meters are calculated according to: \n\n??,? =\n?\n\n?\n??\n\n??,?\n\n?\n?=1\n\n \n\nin which ? is the number of layers used for the discretization of the model from the surface to ? and \n\n??  and ??,?  are the thickness and shear wave velocity for each layer ?, respectively. Moreover ??,? can \n\nbe used to compare the expected site amplification for two different shear wave velocity profiles. \n\nThe Next Generation Attenuation ground motion prediction equations use the shear wave velocity of \n\nthe top 30 m of the subsurface profile (??,30) as the primary parameter for characterizing the effects \n\nof sediment stiffness on ground motions.  \n\nThe Caltrans Seismic Design Criteria classifies sites based on VS of the top 30 m of the soil profile (??30). \n\nSites are divided into the six categories (Soil Profile Types A through F) presented in Table 1. \n\n[Wair, B.

Purpose and objectives of the survey \n\nThis survey was performed in a construction landfill, aiming to evaluate the dynamic response of the \n\nsoil, through the estimation of the shear wave velocities. The velocities of the shear waves were \n\nobtained from the Rayleigh wave\u2019s dispersion using the Multichannel Analysis of Surface Waves \n\nmethod (MASW). Additionally, and because the method uses vertical impulse and vertical recording, \n\nit was also possible to determine the compressional wave velocity (from refraction analysis).  \n\n  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n7 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n2. SITE CONDITIONS \n\n \nAs said before, the location and identification of the survey area in this study is confidential, so the \n\ngeological context, as well as its representation, will be without coordinates or other identifying \n\ninformation. \n\n \n\n2.1. Topography and Geomorphology \n\n \n\nThe survey area is near the coastline represented in Figure 3. Onshore site develops according to the \n\ncontinental tectonics, where erosion landforms are structural plains, which were built due to the slow \n\nincrease of the sedimentary thickness of the crust and the continuous rise of the water level.   \n\nThe site is mainly on the highlands of flat top surface with an absolute elevation of over 200 m, known \n\nas a plateau, which belongs to one type of structural plain.  The site gradually becomes hilly terrain \n\nfrom east to west and develops into coastal cliffs when meeting the coastline.  Some parts of the site \n\nare explored areas of limestone which develop karst topography such as cavities, sink holes and slump \n\nzones. Concerning the mass movements, a large number of seasonal streams flow from east to west, \n\nwhere the drainage patterns across the site are typically dendritic and are characterized by irregular \n\nbranching of tributary control. \n\nThe coastline is made up of long sandy beaches interrupted by rocky shores and steep cliffs that rise \n\nabout 120 meters above sea level. The offshore site develops coastal erosion landform, whose type is \n\ncalled wave cut terrace \u2013 this inclines towards the sea and its outer edge and is roughly parallel to the \n\ncoastline. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3- Location of the area before the construction of the landfill.

Regional Geology   \n\n \n\nThe regional geology is dominated by Proterozoic formation, whilst Neoproterozoic formation occurs \n\nin the western part of the country.  The onshore section is characterized by a transformed margin \n\nwhich has a distinctive, mainly progradational stratigraphic architecture with long-term sedimentary \n\ngaps and high-elevation marine terraces resulting from moderate Upper Cretaceous\u2013Cenozoic to \n\nmajor Quaternary uplifting. Margin style also governs spatial variations in the volume of offshore \n\nsediment dispersed in the associated deep-sea fans. \n\nThe age and lithology of the geological formations existing in the survey area are the following: \n\n? Holocene marine deposits: sand, gravel, clay, etc.  \n\n? Cenomanian-turonian: oolitics and pisolitic limestones, marl (mudstone) and conglomerate.  \n\n? Cenomanian: limestone, oolites, dolomite and conglomerate.  \n\n? Albian: limestones, marl (mudstone) and gypsum conglomerates.  \n\n? Apcian: marl (mudstone), limestone and gypsum. \n\n \n\n2.3. Field Tests and landfill construction \n\n \n\nA geotechnical survey was conducted in the area before the construction of the landfill, including \n\ndrilling, in situ tests, SPT, sampling and laboratory tests. \n\nThat investigation classified the site stratigraphic according to the following: \n\nSoil layers: \n\na. Marine deposits; \n\nb. Loose, fine-grained, silty sand; \n\nc. Very soft clay. \n\nRock units: \n\nd. Moderately weathered Limestone; \n\ne. Moderately weathered Mudstone; \n\n \n\nBefore the construction of the landfill, the harbor basin was dredged. After the excavation, there were \n\nmainly two sorts of rock units: moderately weathered limestone (d) and moderately weathered \n\nmudstone (e). \n\nAll the soil layers were removed completely before the construction of the quay (Figure 4). \n\n \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n9 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 4- Location of the area after the construction of the landfill. (Image adapted from Google Earth) \n\n \n\n2.4. Compaction of the landfill \n\n \n\nDuring the construction, the landfill was compacted. The aim of the compression of the landfill is to \n\nincrease the resistance to the strain disturbance of the soil under the action of external forces; reduce \n\npossible volumetric variations, reducing the empty spaces and consequently the water absorption \n\ncapacity and the percolation decreases, making the soil more stable. \n\nThere is no information regarding the moisture content, but concerning the area compression, Figure \n\n5 shows a representative scheme of the compression energy inherent to the survey area.

M., \n\n(2010)]. \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n10 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 5- Disposition of the different compaction energies along the survey area. \n\n \n\nThe primary technique used in the compaction of the landfill was the dynamic compaction. This \n\nprocess consists primarily of dropping a heavy weight repeatedly on the ground at regular intervals. \n\nThe weight of the hammer used varies over a range of 80 to 360 kN, and the height of the hammer \n\ndrop varies between 7.5 and 30.5 m. The stress waves generated by the hammer drops aid in the \n\ndensification. The degree of compaction achieved at a given site depends on the following three \n\nfactors: 1). Weight of hammer; 2). Height of hammer drop and on the 3). Spacing of locations at which \n\nthe hammer is dropped. However there are no references regarding this values. [Das, B.

DATA ACQUISITION \n\n \nThe present document reports the acquisition and processing of 28 seismic profiles, acquired between \n\nMarch and July 2015, using geometries favorable to the refraction and MASW methods.  \n\nThe survey was conducted along the profiles shown in Figure 6 and, despite the acquisition orientation, \n\nthe seismic lines are mostly oriented NNE-SSW with a maximum length of 354 m. \n\n \n\n \nFigure 6 \u2013 Survey seismic profiles acquired in March 2015 (blue lines) and June/July 2015 (green lines) (WGS84). \n\n  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n12 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n3.1. Equipment and Data Acquisition Parameters \n\n \n\nThe equipment and data acquisition parameters were carefully selected in order to meet the \n\nrequirements and goals of the project. The energy was generated by two different sources used during \n\nthe survey: the Accelerated Weight Drop (AWD) seismic source PEG-40 and the sledgehammer + base \n\nplate. The source used for each shot was selected according to the weather and site \n\nconditions/limitations. The land streamer used had 24 channels (vertical geophones) spaced 1.2 m, \n\nwith a total active length of 27.6 m, and the recorder was an exploration seismograph Geode 24 \n\nchannels (Figure 7).

Geometry \n\n \n\nTo process the refraction data, Rayfract\u00ae software was used. This has the particularity of using station \n\nnumbers, instead of real distances, to define the shots and geophones\u2019 positions. Regarding that fact, \n\nthe geophones\u2019 spacing of 1.2 m was used as the measuring unit of all the remaining \n\npositions/distances. To accomplish this limitation, a multiple offset geometry was used, along with the \n\nsource and the first geophone distanced by 2.4 m and 9.6 m, respectively offset 1 and offset 2 (Figure \n\n8). The multiple offsets, at 2.4 m and 9.6 m, had the aim of increasing the resolution on shallow layers \n\nand of achieving greater depths of investigation, respectively. \n\nFor the refraction P wave, two shot offset were processed, however, for the MASW, only the larger \n\nshot offset was used to guarantee the desired investigation depth. \n\nIn order to increase the signal to noise ratio, for each offset 2 or 5 shots were stacked, according to \n\nthe selected source (2 stacks using PEG-40 and 5 with the sledgehammer). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 8 \u2013 Offset diagram of the seismic spread used for the survey (not to scale). \n\n \n\nThe space increment along the line was set at 4.8m (spread advance in line); meaning, when the two \n\nshots for that spread position are executed, the system is moved forward 4.8m and a new set of shots, \n\nin the 2 different offsets, are executed (Figure 9).  \n \n\nThe raw recorded data has the geometry assigned for each shot in distance.

Navigation and Positioning \n\n \n\nA criterious positioning procedure was made. The topographic survey was carried out using a RTK \n\nsystem. A measurement (x y, and z) was performed at the 1st shot position and for geophones 1, 12 \n\nand 24 (G01; G12; G24; S01 in Figure 9); at the last shot position and again for geophones 1, 12 and 24 \n\n(G01\u2019; G12\u2019; G24\u2019; S##\u2019); and in areas with curves in the profile and topographic variations, such as \n\ntrenches or slopes (Figure 10). The positioning was based on the WGS84 datum and the elevations are \n\nrelative to Mean Sea Level (MSL). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 10- Representation of the measurement positions acquired according to the topographic \n\nvariations. The blue points represent shot positions and the red ones geophone positions in the landstreamer. \n\n \n\nAlthough the survey area is relatively flat and all the lines range from 2 to 4 m above sea level, the \n\nsame profile of the topographic variations is always less than 1 m. \n\n \n\n3.5. Data Acquisition Constraints \n\n \n\nDuring daytime there was construction work in progress on the site. Therefore, the MASW survey was \n\nconducted at night in order to avoid ambient/seismic noise. The acquisition was sometimes \n\nconstrained by obstacles in the planned lines, adverse weather conditions and infrastructures, such as \n\ntrenches (Figure 11). Small curves or even small spatial shifts from the planned profile were made \n\nwhen it was necessary to bypass some obstacles (vehicles or pavement bricks - Figure 12). \n\nL09_A Jul 52 52 157.2 120 \n\nL10 Jun 70 70 214.8 177.6 \n\nL11 Jul 54 54 162 124.8 \n\nL12_A Jul 42 42 133.2 96 \n\nL12_B Jul 60 60 176.4 139.2 \n\nL12_C Jul 18 18 75.6 38.4 \n\nL13 Jul 26 26 94.8 57.6 \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n17 \n\n   \n\n  \n\nFor example, in the case of a trench, besides the position of the geophones G01, G12 and G24, other \n\ngeophone positions had to be measured in order to get all the topographic variations. \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Example of topographic constraints: (a) trench and (b) topographic slope. \n\n \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Example of obstacles that forced a spatial shift in the profile: (a) presence of a vehicle and (b) pavement bricks. \n\n  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n18 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n4. SIGNAL ANALYSIS  \n\n \n\nIn order to ensure that the data could be processed successfully, all the acquired seismic data \n\nunderwent a thorough quality control procedure of the signal quality, positioning and acquisition \n\ngeometry. The following QC was implemented for each line: \n\n? Refracted wave check for selected shots by a shot to gather analysis; \n\n? Noise analysis and signal saturation assessment; \n\n? Positioning quality control \u2013 the lines have to follow some requirements, such as overlapping \n\nwith previous acquired profiles, matching what was planned or, if the profiles do not match \n\ndue to constraints/obstacles in the field, they should have been approved; \n\n? The geometry needs to be respected and checked before processing. Therefore, the source \n\nand receiver offset was controlled for each land shot, in order to ensure that the chosen \n\ngeometry was preserved. \n\n \n\n4.1. Source Analysis \n\nDue to the weather conditions, the landfill was muddy, which made it difficult to use of the van and, \n\nconsequently, the PEG-40. As a result, some shots had to be done with another source \u2013 the \n\nsledgehammer. In the L03, eight shots (10169-10176) were acquired with a sledgehammer. Hence, in \n\norder to understand which frequency is generated from the two sources, the frequency spectrum of \n\nthe sources is described below (Figure 13). \n\n  \n(a) \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n19 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n  \n(b) \n\nFigure 13 \u2013 a) Frequency spectrum of Source 2-Sledgehammer regarding the 10070 of L03 and b) Frequency spectrum of \n\nSource 1-PEG 40 regarding shot 10018 of L03. \n\n \n\nThe amplitude spectrum analysis allows the identification of the dominant frequency or period \n\ncorresponding to the maximum amplitude value. Considering the two spectrums, it is possible to \n\nconclude that PEG-40 has a higher dominant frequency than that of the sledgehammer. In both cases, \n\nthe frequency was limited to the highest amplitudes for the processing.  \n\n \n\n4.2. QC Data Issues \n\n \n\nDuring the QC analysis, some issues were detected in the data: \n\n? Some data was affected by low frequency resonance depredating velocity spectrum and, \n\ntherefore, making the dispersion curve picking impossible. This issue is identified in: \n\no Shots 10010 and 10022 of L3 (Figure 14 \u2013 a) and b) respectively); \n\no Shot 10052 of L8 (Figure 14 \u2013 c). \n\n? Some shots were also affected by the plate\u2019s vibration, due to the coupling of the base plate to \n\na hard surface, leading to a rebound of the base plate and causing subsidiary pulses and ringing \n\neffects: \n\no Shot 10010 of L11 presents high frequency noise; therefore, this profile was processed in \n\nMASW using the maximum frequency content of 50 Hz (Figure 14 \u2013 d)); \n\no Shot 10026 of L13 was not processed in MASW because it shows multiple pulses caused \n\nby the plate\u2019s vibration (Figure 14 \u2013 e)). \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n20 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(a) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(b) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(c) \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n21 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(d) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(e) \n\nFigure 14 \u2013 Phase velocity spectrum on the left and frequency spectrum on the right for a) L3 shot 10010; b) L3 shot \n\n10022; c) L8 and shot 10052; d) L11 and shot 10010 and e) L13 and shot 10026. \n\n \n  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n22 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n5. SEISMIC DATA PROCESSING \n\n \n\nTwenty-eight seismic profiles were processed using MASW and refraction methodologies were used, \n\nrespectively, winMASW\u00ae and Rayfract\u00ae software. The generic processing flow applied to the data was \n\norganized as in Figure 15. All the shots were used in the refraction methodologies, whereas, in the \n\nMASW, only the far offset shots were processed. \n\n \n\n \n \n\nFigure 15 - Processing workflow applied to the seismic lines. Rounded boxes represent the processing steps and grey \n\nboxes represent the input/output products. \n\n \n\nThe use of the refraction processing was crucial for the MASW processing, because without an a priori \n\nprocessing to establish near surface structure (velocity and thickness), the dispersion of the results \n\nafter inversion was tremendous.  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n23 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n5.1. Refraction Processing \n\n \n\nThe seismic refraction processing was done using Rayfract\u00ae software after importing the following \n\ndata (Figure 15): \n\n- SEG-2 with nominal geometry assigned; \n\n- Topographic insertion. \n\n \n\nThe processing in Rayfract\u00ae included the picking of the first arrival (Figure 16), for every shot and every \n\nchannel where the SNR allows accurate picking.   \n\nThe analyses of the first arrival picking was done for every line, allowing a minimal RMS error of the \n\nRayfract models (see Appendix A: Notation used) \n\n \nFigure 16\u2013 Shot gathered analysis (shot 10010, l01) for refracted wave analysis. \n\n \n\nA 2D compressional wave velocity model in grid format (*.grd) was obtained for each line plotted using \n\nthe Golden Software's Surfer\u00ae (see Figure 17, using the Delta-t-V method. This pseudo-2D turning ray \n\ninversion method was chosen because it delivers continuous 1D depth ??. velocity profiles for all \n\nprofile stations and it has a better vertical resolution than the other inversion methods available in the \n\nsoftware. \n\nThe 2D compressional wave models were used to infer the thickness/geometry of the layers, as \n\npreliminary input for MASW data processing/modeling (see Figure 18). \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n24 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 17 - 2D compressional wave velocity model obtained fom L01.MASW Processing \n\n \n\nFor each shotpoint with 9.6 m S/R offset, a 1D ?? vertical velocity model was located in the middle of \n\nthe spread between the 12th and the 13th geophone (see red star in Figure 9). The source offset of \n\n2.4m wasn\u00b4t used because it would not cover the desired investigation depth. \n\n \n\n5.1.1.

Velocity Spectrum and dispersion curve picking \n\nFor each shot, superficial waves were selected (Figure 19) to represent the velocity spectrum.  \n\n \n\nFigure 19 - Shot gathered analysis (shot 10010, l01) for refracted wave analysis - selection of the surface waves. \n\n \n\nThe velocity spectrum corresponds to an energy scatter plot that relates the frequency with the phase \n\nvelocity for surface waves.  \n\nGround roll cone \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n26 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n For picking the dispersion curve, the points that belonged to a particular propagation mode of a \n\nsurface wave were selected and the fundamental mode (Figure 20) was picked in the f-v domain. \n\nSometimes, the interference of different modes can alter the apparent dispersion characteristics of \n\nthe fundamental mode or result in higher modes being misinterpreted as fundamental. Therefore, the \n\npicking was only made up until the interference of a higher mode.  \n\nAll the 1D shear wave models resulted from the fundamental vibration mode picking of the velocity \n\nspectrum.  Besides that, sometimes, a higher mode can be visible in the data such as in Figure 20, yet \n\nit wasn't consistent in all data.  \n\n \nFigure 20 \u2013Picking of the fundamental vibration mode \u2013 dispersion curve in the F-V domain. \n\n \n\nAfter the picking in the f-v domain, it is possible to see the dispersion curve in the f-k spectrum (Figure \n\n21). \n\n  \n(a) (b) \n\nFigure 21- Dispersion curve in the f-k spectrum: (a) amplitude and (b) logarithm of the amplitude.  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n27 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n5.1.3. Maximum depth penetration \n\n \n\nThe maximum penetration depth in a homogeneous medium is about one wavelength. The currently \n\naccepted rule of thumb for the maximum penetration depth is approximately half of the longest wave \n\nlength (?/2) or (?/2.5) [Elisoft \u2013 geophysical software and services, 2015].

Modeling and Inversion of the dispersion curve \n\nThe initial thickness model created, based on the refractive method, is introduced at this stage of \n\nprocessing (Figure 18), and then adjusted to the velocities of each layer and bedrock to adjust to the \n\nvelocity spectrum (Figure 22). \n\n \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n28 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 22 \u2013 Introduction of the initial thicknesses model based on the refraction method. \n\n \nTable 6- Initial ?? profile used for shot 10006 \n\n??

This inversion is made by means of an optimization process (genetic \n\nalgorithms) that requires the computer a big calculation effort. (Dal Moro et all, 2007) \n\nIn the inversion, two 1D ?? models were obtained: the \u201cbest\u201d model (in terms of lower misfit, i.e the \n\ndiscrepancy between the observed and the calculated curve) and a medium model calculated by \n\nmeans of MPPD (Marginal Posterior Probability Density). However, just the best model was considered \n\nfurther on. The next figure shows the results of the first inversion.

In this inversion, its \n\nlimits were adjusted to achieve a better approximation with the dispersion curve.  \n\nThe next figure shows the results of the second inversion.

Model Validation \n\n \n\nThe 1D shear wave velocity model obtained in the second inversion must be compared with the \n\ndispersion curve of the fundamental mode in order to determine if the misfit is satisfactory (Figure 25). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 25\u2013 Comparison between the dispersion curve and the final model created \n\n \nFor the interpolation, each and every S-wave profile (?? versus depth) was displaced/ incremented \n\nwith its respective topographic elevation, as represented in Figure 26. Also, the layer thickness, given \n\nby the software winMASW\u00ae, was converted to the depth of half of the layer, considering 2 points for \n\nthe first layer (1/2 layer and the topography), both with the same velocity and a middle point for the \n\nremaining layers (see example in Figure 26). \n\n \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n31 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 26\u2013 Example of a conversion from layer thickness given by the 1D model to the depth of half a layer used to \n\ngenerate the 2D shear wave velocity models. \n\n \n\nTo generate a 2D ?? section, all 1D ?? models per line are interpolated and plotted using Golden \n\nSoftware's Surfer\u00ae \n\n  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n32 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION \n\n \n\nThe 2D shear wave velocity section was obtained for each profile using Golden Software's Surfer\u00ae and \n\ninterpolating all 1D ?? models of the respective line (Figure 26). The interpolation was performed using \n\nthe Triangulation methodology (Golden Software, Inc, 2014) with a spacing of 0.2 m and anisotropy \n\nratio of 5. The model was filtered using a low pass filter (moving average) with a filter size of 3 rows x \n\n5 columns.  \n\nThe lines were plotted from southwest (SW) to northeast (NE), independently of the acquisition \n\norientation. \n\nFor a better perception of the evolution of the dynamic properties of the soil along the landfill, all the \n\n28 2D shear velocity models were paced in its locations and represented by a 3D software - Voxler 3\u00ae \n\nby Golden Software, on a representative scheme of the area under study. \n\nIn addition to that, every model has its own ??30 graphic on top, rightly placed. This value it\u2019s an output \n\nof the software winMASW for every 1D ?? profile. This estimation, however, goes beyond the \n\nmaximum penetration depth, so after the layer stratification, the bedrock is assumed with the same \n\nshear wave velocity until the 30 m of depth. \n\n \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n33 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \nFigure 27\u2013 3D map showing the shear wave velocity models for the study area.  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n34 \n\n   \n\n  \n\nConcerning the sea location, at northwest from the survey, it is possible to see the deepening of the \n\nbedrock towards the sea. However, the landfill is at the same height relative to the average level of \n\nthe sea water due to the higher thickness of sediments above.  \n\nRegarding the acquisition time, the lines acquired in March (rainy season) (Table 3) present lower \n\nvelocities above the bedrock, this is probably due to the high water content in the landfill in that time \n\nseason. On the contrary, as expected, the remaing lines, in general, present higher velocities in the \n\nlandfill. However, closest to the sea, the shear waves velocities models tend to decrease its velocities \n\nin the landfill, for example L04_B, L12_B, L12_A, etc. (Figure 6 and Figure 27). \n\nBesides, several elements may affect the shear wave\u2019s velocities, such as tides, uneven compression \n\nin the landfill, different soils, which can lead to different elastic properties, etc. \n\nA deeper analysis could be done to each shear wave velocity model, so three profiles were chosen to \n\ncompare L01, L02 and L06 (Figure 28 and Figure 29-b)).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n \n\nFigure 28\u2013shear wave velocity model for a) L01 and b) L06 resultant from the interpolation of all 1D ?? models obtained \n\nfor each line. \n\n \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n35 \n\n   \n\n  \n\nThe purpose of comparing L01 and L06 is to understand the influence of different compaction energies \n\n(Figure 5) on shear wave velocities. For that effect, the lines were acquired in the same season to \n\neliminate other factor influences. \n\nAnalyzing these two models, the differences in the depth of the bedrock is clearly visible, changing \n\napproximately 5 m. The minimum shear wave velocity achieved in both models is not significant. In \n\nmodel 06, ????? = 217 ?/? where as in model 01, ?????  =  245 ?/?.  \n\nHowever, despite the L06 being acquired in a zone with higher compaction energy (7000-8000 kNm) \n\nthan the L01 (6000 kNm), the shear wave velocities in L06 are lower than in L01. Perhaps the proximity \n\nof the sea may have a greater influence than the compaction energy made on site or the materials \n\nused in each section of the landfill were different, having consequently a different responses. \n\nThe purpose of comparing L01 and L02 is to understand the influence of the rainy season in the landfill \n\nbehavior. Comparing this two models, the minimum velocity in L01, as it was already said above, \n\nis ????? = 245 ?/?, where as in model 02, ????? = 293 ?/?. The lines acquired in June reveals \n\nhigher minimum velocities (almost 50?/?) than the one acquired in March, even though L01 being \n\nlocated in a bigger energy compaction zone. \n\n \n\n6.1. ???? Analysis  \n\n \nAll the lines analyzed present a ??30 above 360 ?/?, which means that, by Caltrans Seismic Design \nCriteria, all the soils are considered in the site class C - Very dense soil and soft rock. \nHowever, there are some diferences between the lines. For instance, there are models with very low \nvalues for the ??30, such as L04_B, L10, L11 and L13 and models with a great variety, like L02 or L07_B. \nAlthought, the lack of information regarding the site, namely the soil conditions and composition \nprevent a deeper analysis. \n\n \n6.2. Tides Influence \n\n \n\nFinally, to exemplify the tides influence in the shear wave velocities models, due to the water level \n\nvariation, I used L02 to make this analysis because it was acquired in two different days.  \n\nAnalyzing the log acquisition of this line (Table 7), regarding the day and hour, a tides plot for each day \n\nwas taken and plotted (Figure 34). These tides plots relate the sea level, in meters, with the time of \n\nthe day, indicating also the high and low tides periods. \n\nFor a better visualization and characterization, the tides plot were edited and selected for the \n\nacquisition period of each shot (Figure 29). \n\n  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n36 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \nTable 7 - Acquisition log for L02 \n\nStation File name Date Hour \n\n-8 10002 1st acq. day 2:02 \n\n-12 10004 1st acq. day 2:09 \n\n-16 10006 1st acq. day 2:16 \n\n-20 10008 1st acq. day 2:21 \n\n-24 10010 1st acq. day 2:25 \n\n-28 10012 1st acq. day 2:30 \n\n-32 10014 1st acq. day 2:38 \n\n-36 10016 1st acq. day 2:43 \n\n-40 10018 1st acq. day 2:48 \n\n-44 10020 1st acq. day 2:54 \n\n-48 10022 1st acq. day 3:04 \n\n-52 10024 1st acq. day 3:08 \n\n-56 10026 1st acq. day 3:14 \n\n-60 10028 1st acq. day 3:20 \n\n-64 10030 1st acq. day 3:24 \n\n-68 10032 1st acq. day 3:29 \n\n-72 10034 1st acq. day 3:34 \n\n-76 10036 1st acq. day 3:37 \n\n-80 10038 1st acq. day 3:43 \n\n-84 10040 1st acq. day 4:53 \n\n-88 10042 1st acq. day 5:00 \n\n-92 10044 1st acq. day 5:12 \n\n-96 10046 1st acq. day 5:16 \n\n-100 10048 1st acq. day 5:22 \n\n-104 10050 1st acq. day 5:26 \n\n-108 10052 1st acq. day 5:32 \n\n-112 10054 1st acq. day 5:36 \n\n-116 10056 1st acq. day 5:45 \n\n-120 10058 1st acq. day 5:55 \n\n-124 10060 1st acq. day 6:01 \n \n\nStation File name Date Hour \n\n-128 10062 2nd acq. day 2:30 \n\n-132 10064 2nd acq. day 2:35 \n\n-136 10066 2nd acq. day 2:39 \n\n-140 10068 2nd acq. day 2:43 \n\n-144 10070 2nd acq. day 2:47 \n\n-148 10072 2nd acq. day 2:51 \n\n-152 10074 2nd acq. day 2:54 \n\n-156 10076 2nd acq. day 2:59 \n\n-160 10078 2nd acq. day 3:09 \n\n-164 10080 2nd acq. day 3:12 \n\n-168 10082 2nd acq. day 3:16 \n\n-172 10084 2nd acq. day 3:30 \n\n-176 10086 2nd acq. day 3:34 \n\n-180 10088 2nd acq. day 3:37 \n\n-184 10090 2nd acq. day 3:42 \n\n-188 10092 2nd acq. day 3:48 \n\n-192 10094 2nd acq. day 3:51 \n\n-196 10096 2nd acq. day 3:54 \n\n-200 10098 2nd acq. day 3:58 \n\n-204 10100 2nd acq. day 4:01 \n\n-208 10102 2nd acq. day 4:04 \n\n-212 10104 2nd acq. day 4:10 \n\n-216 10106 2nd acq. day 4:23 \n\n-220 10108 2nd acq. day 4:26 \n\n-224 10110 2nd acq. day 4:30 \n\n-228 10112 2nd acq. day 4:34 \n\n-232 10114 2nd acq. day 4:38 \n\n-236 10116 2nd acq. day 4:41 \n\n-240 10118 2nd acq. day 4:48 \n\n-244 10120 2nd acq. day 5:08 \n\n-248 10122 2nd acq. day 5:14 \n\n-252 10124 2nd acq. day 5:17 \n\n-256 10126 2nd acq. day 5:25 \n\n-260 10128 2nd acq. day 5:28 \n\n-264 10130 2nd acq. day 5:31 \n\n-268 10132 2nd acq. day 5:35 \n\n-272 10134 2nd acq. day 5:38 \n \n\n \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n37 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 29 - Tides plot (above) regarding the acquisition time of the shots. Note that the line's acquisition begins on the right side (1st Acquisition day); after the shot 10060, the line was \n\nacquired in the second day, having a different tides plot. \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n38 \n\n   \n\n  \n\n \n\nAs we can see the tides level has a real impact in the shear wave velocity model, a lower velocity layer \n\nfollows the tides level along the line, reaching a maximum elevation in the highest tides, in both days. \n\nFurthermore, the differences in tides level is visible in the shear wave\u2019s velocity (transition between \n\nshots 10060 and 10062). However, the differences in the tides only change the saturation level, \n\nbecause a higher zone still affected with water. \n\n  \n\n6.3. Elastic Modulus \n\n \n\n[Mavko, G. et al, 2009] summarizes some popular and useful ?? ?  ?. Density is a simple \n\nvolumetric average of the rock constituent densities and is closely related to porosity by: \n\n?? = (1 ? ?)?0 + ??1 \n\nwhere ?0 is the density of mineral grains, ??1 is the density of pore fluids, and ? is the porosity.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 30 - Both forms of Gardner's relations applied to log and laboratory sandstone data- [Castagna et al., 1993] \n\n \n\nUsing the equation selected in red, it was possible to estimate the density from the P-wave models. \n\nHowever, this was only an estimation, because the equation is intended for consolidated rocks, wich \n\nis not the case of landfill in study. Above it is the result of the density model calculation using the \n\nequation referred. \n\nThe following profiles (Figure 31 &amp; Figure 32) were disposed with a vertical scale of 1:15 and a \n\nhorizontal scale of 1:30. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n39 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\nFigure 31 \u2013 2D Density model calculated to L01 from the 2D P-wave velocity model of the same profile. \n\n \n\nWith the density values calculate, it is already possible to achieve the shear modulus (Figure 32), \n\nthrough the formula:  ???? = ???\n2.

CONCLUSIONS \n\n \n\nThe construction landfill was successfully surveyed. The site was acoustically very noisy; \n\nnevertheless, due to the decision of acquiring data during the night shift, the obtained data shows high \n\nquality level allowing a reliable interpretation for refraction method and for surface waves analysis.  \n\nIn seismic refraction, 1396 shots were analyzed, resulting in 28 2D compressional velocity models, \n\nmaking a total length of 4267 m. For MASW, 695 shots were analyzed, resulting in 695 1D shear velocity \n\nprofiles and 28 2D models, making a total length of 3225 m.  \n\nThe quality control and acquisition format, provided by Geosurveys, was tailored to ensure that the \n\nacquired data meet the requirements, in order to better estimate the seismic wave velocities and, \n\ntherefore, to assess the elastic condition of the landfill. The acquisition parameters, namely the \n\nnumber of geophones, the distance between them and the use of the biggest shot offset allow a better \n\nvertical and horizontal resolution, however a horizontal resolution of 4.8 m in the 2D shear wave \n\nvelocity model is relatively low. \n\nThe obtained shear wave velocity models are in agreement with the site characteristics, according \n\nto the information available. Within the same line, the 1D shear wave velocity profiles show a good \n\nlateral continuity and consistency in velocity variations, with velocities varying between 200 and \n\n500m/s within the landfill. A shear wave velocity inversion can be seen in almost the profiles (see \n\nFigure 27), from 0 m (MSL) until the bedrock, what is consistent with the phreatic level. \n\nThe landfill velocities (above the bedrock) obtained for the lines acquired in March are lower than \n\nthe velocities obtained for the lines acquired in June, this is probably due to the high water content in \n\nthe landfill in March (rainy season). At first sight, the different energy compaction zones did not have \n\na direct and straight forward relation with the shear wave velocity models. \n\nRegarding the ??30 analysis, all the lines present values above 360 ?/?, which means that, by \n\nCaltrans Seismic Design Criteria, all the soils are considered in the site class C - Very dense soil and soft \n\nrock. However, there are some diferences between the lines. For instance, there are models with very \n\nlow values for the ??30, such as L04_B, L10, L11 and L13, that could have a different site response \n\ncomparatively to the other models. \n\nFor future work, a couple of cross sections models could be acquired in order to evaluate the landfill \n\nbehavior along the coast. Some field testes, after the final compaction and construction of the landfill, \n\nsuch as drilling, SPT, sampling and laboratory testing could be useful to consolidate the work. Those \n\nwould allow the comparison between the shear wave velocities and the SPT tests or an accurate \n\nevaluation of shear modulus, if some densities measures of the landfill where supplied.  \n\n  \n\n\n\nShear Wave velocities in a construction landfill  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n41 \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\nREFRENCES \n\n \n\nAkin, M.
