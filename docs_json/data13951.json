A picture of sturmanite is given in the graphical\nabstract (used with the kind permission of M&amp;D minerals).\nSturmanite usually forms long hexagonal crystals, as may be seen\nin the picture. The chemistry of sturmanite is most interesting. In\ncomparison with the mineral ettringite Ca6Al2(OH)12(SO4)3?26H2O\n[3], one sulphate unit has been replaced with tetrahydroxoborate,\nB(OH)4. The mineral is predominantly made up of water with four\nout of every five atoms in this mineral is either a part of a water\nmolecule or an hydroxide. Sturmanite is trigonal, P31c, Z = 2, with\na 11.188(9) \u00c5, c 21.91(7) \u00c5, and V 2375.1(5) \u00c53. According to\nPushcharovsky et al. [4], the structure of sturmanite consists of\ntwo coaxial elements parallel to [0 0 1] and is the most distinctive\nfeatures of sturmanite. The main one is a column of polyhedra\nformed by Fe-octahedra and Ca-polyhedra [4]. The Fe(OH)6\noctahedra are located along the three-fold axes that pass through\nthe origin of the cell. These are linked to three VIIICa-polyhedra,\nlocated around the three-fold axes, in between the Fe(OH)6\noctahedra [4].

[4] both structural modules are linked to each other by a com-\nplex system of hydrogen bonds.\n\nRaman spectroscopy has proven most useful for the study of\nmineral structure [5\u20138]. Vibrational spectroscopy is very important\nfor the study of Mn containing minerals [3,9]. The objective of this\nresearch is to analyse the Raman and infrared spectra of sturma-\nnite and to relate the spectra to the mineral structure.\nExperimental\n\nSamples description and preparation\n\nThe sturmanite sample studied in this work forms part of the\ncollection of the Geology Department of the Federal University of\nOuro Preto, Minas Gerais, Brazil, with sample code SAA-170. The\nmineral originated from Black Rock mine, Kalahari, RSA.\n\nThe sample was gently crushed and the associated minerals\nwere removed under a stereomicroscope Leica MZ4. The sturma-\nnite studied in this work occurs as single crystals with prismatic\nhexagonal form up to 5 mm. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nin the EDS mode was applied to support the mineral\ncharacterisation.\nFig. 2.

For each selected element. An appro-\npriate standard was used as listed in Table 1. The electron probe\nmicroanalysis in the WDS (wavelength dispersive spectrometer)\nmode was obtained at 15 kV accelerating voltage and beam current\nof 10 nA. Chemical formula was calculated on the basis of 49 oxy-\ngen atoms.\nRaman microprobe spectroscopy\n\nCrystals of sturmanite were placed on a polished metal surface\non the stage of an Olympus BHSM microscope, which is equipped\nwith 10?, 20?, and 50? objectives.

Repeated acquisitions on the crystals using\nthe highest magnification (50?) were accumulated to improve\nthe signal to noise ratio of the spectra. Raman Spectra were cali-\nbrated using the 520.5 cm?1 line of a silicon wafer.\nInfrared spectroscopy\n\nInfrared spectra were obtained using a Nicolet Nexus 870 FTIR\nspectrometer with a smart endurance single bounce diamond\nATR cell. Spectra over the 4000\u2013525 cm?1 range were obtained\nby the co-addition of 128 scans with a resolution of 4 cm?1 and a\nmirror velocity of 0.6329 cm/s. Spectra were co-added to improve\nthe signal to noise ratio.\n\nSpectral manipulation such as baseline correction/adjustment\nand smoothing were performed using the Spectracalc software\npackage GRAMS (Galactic Industries Corporation, NH, USA). Band\ncomponent analysis was undertaken using the Jandel \u2018Peakfit\u2019 soft-\nware package that enabled the type of fitting function to be\nselected and allows specific parameters to be fixed or varied\naccordingly. Band fitting was done using a Lorentzian\u2013Gaussian\ncross-product function with the minimum number of component\nbands used for the fitting process. The Lorentzian\u2013Gaussian ratio\nwas maintained at values greater than 0.7 and fitting was\nFig. 3.

The image shows an sturmanite crystal aggre-\ngate as provided in the graphical abstract. Individual crystals up\nto 30 lm in length are observed. Crystals show hexagonal pris-\nmatic habitus. Qualitative chemical analysis shows a homogeneous\nphase, composed by Ca, Al and Si. Carbon was also observed and\noccurs due to C coating. Boron was not detected as the atomic\nnumber is low.\nSpectroscopy\n\nBackground\nSulphate typically is a tetrahedral oxyanion with Raman bands\n\nat 981 (m1), 451 (m2), 1104 (m3) and 613 (m4) cm\n?1 [10]. Some sul-\n\nphates have their symmetry reduced through acting as monoden-\ntate and bidentate ligands [10]. In the case of bidentate behaviour\nboth bridging and chelating ligands are known. This reduction in\nspectrum) and (b) Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the 100\u2013300 cm?1 spectral\n\n\n\n28 R.L. Frost et al. / Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy 133 (2014) 24\u201330\nsymmetry is observed by the splitting of the m3 and m4 into two\ncomponents under C3v symmetry and 3 components under C2v\nsymmetry. The vibrational spectra of ettringite have been reported\n[3]. The Raman spectroscopy of the aqueous sulphate tetrahedral\noxyanion yields the symmetric stretching (m1) vibration at\n981 cm?1, the in-plane bending (m2) mode at 451 cm\n\n?1, the anti-\nsymmetric stretching (m3) mode at 1104 cm\n\n?1 and the out-of-plane\nbending (m4) mode at 613 cm\n\n?1 [11]. Ross reports the interpreta-\ntion of the infrared spectra for potassium alum as m1, 981 cm\n\n?1;\nm2, 465 cm\n\n?1; m3, 1200, 1105 cm\n?1; m4, 618 and 600 cm\n\n?1 [12].\nWater stretching modes were reported at 3400 and 3000 cm?1,\nbending modes at 1645 cm?1, and librational modes at 930 and\n700 cm?1 [13]. The Raman spectrum of the mineral chalcanthite\nshows a single symmetric stretching mode at 984.7 cm?1. Two m2\nmodes are observed at 463 and 445 cm?1 and three m3 modes at\n1173, 1146 and 1100 cm?1. The m4 mode is observed as a single\nband at 610 cm?1. A complex set of overlapping bands is observed\nin the low wavenumber region at 257, 244, 210, 136 and 126 cm?1.\nRecently, Raman spectra of four basic copper sulphate minerals,\nnamely antlerite, brochiantite, posnjakite and langite, were pub-\nlished [14]. The SO symmetric stretching modes for the four basic\ncopper sulphate minerals are observed at 985, 990, 972 and\n974 cm?1. Only the mineral brochantite showed a single band in\nthis region. Multiple bands were observed for these minerals in\nthe antisymmetric stretching region.\nFig. 4. (a) Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the 2600\u20134000 cm?1 spectral range (up\nspectral range (lower spectrum).\nVibrational spectroscopy\n\nThe Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the complete mea-\nsured wavenumbers is displayed in Fig. 1a. This figure shows the\nposition of the Raman bands and their relative intensities and also\nprovides an indication of the sharpness of these bands. Large parts\nof the spectrum are noted where little or no intensity is found.\nTherefore, the spectra are subdivided into sections based upon\nthe differing vibrations being studied. The infrared spectrum of\nsturmanite over the 500\u20134000 cm?1 spectral range is reported in\nFig. 1b. This figure shows the position and relative intensities of\nthe infrared active sturmanite bands. The spectra are subdivided\ninto sections as is convenient based upon the vibrations being\nstudied. A comparison may be made between the Raman and infra-\nred spectra of sturmanite.\n\nThe Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the 900\u20131200 cm?1\n\nspectral range is displayed in Fig. 2a. This spectral region is the\nregion of the sulphate symmetric stretching modes. The spectrum\nis dominated by an intense Raman band at 990 cm?1. This band at\n990 cm?1 is assigned to the SO4\n\n2? m1 symmetric stretching mode.\nThe position of this band is in agreement with previously pub-\nlished data [15]. Two low intensity shoulders to this band are\nobserved at 981 and 995 cm?1. In addition, Raman bands are\nobserved at 1069 (sharp) and 1117 (very broad). These bands are\nattributed to the SO4\n\n2? m3 antisymmetric stretching mode.\nper spectrum) and (b) infrared spectrum of sturmanite over the 2600\u20134000 cm?1\n\n\n\nR.L. Frost et al. / Spectrochimica Acta Part A: Molecular and Biomolecular Spectroscopy 133 (2014) 24\u201330 29\nAccording to Myneni [16], the SO4\n2? polyhedra of the channels in\n\nsturmanite are present in three crystallographically different sites\nand exhibit weakly split S\u2013O antisymmetric stretching vibrations\nat 1136 cm?1 (with several components) and symmetric stretch\nat 1016, 1008, and 989 cm?1. The observation of three symmetric\nstretching bands in this work, fits well with the concept of three\ndifferent non-equivalent sulphate units in the sturmanite struc-\nture. The band at 1069 cm?1 looks very much like a carbonate\nstretching mode. It is possible that the mineral being studied is a\nsolid solution between sturmanite and thaumasite Ca3(SO4)\n[Si(OH)6]CO3?12H2O. Thus, the presence of this latter mineral in\nthe solid solution would give rise to the carbonate bands.\n\nThe infrared spectrum of sturmanite over the 700\u20131200 cm?1\n\nspectral range is shown in Fig. 2b. Strong infrared bands are\nobserved at 1080 and 1107 cm?1 and are assigned to the SO4\n\n2? m3\nantisymmetric stretching mode. These bands are of very low inten-\nsity in the Raman spectrum. The low intensity infrared band at\n983 cm?1 is attributed to the SO4\n\n2? m1 symmetric stretching mode.\nThis band is the equivalent of the Raman band observed at\n990 cm?1. The infrared bands of sturmanite at 878 and 937 cm?1\n\nmay be associated with water librational bands.\nThe Raman spectra of sturmanite over the 300\u2013800 cm?1 spec-\n\ntral range and over the 150\u2013300 cm?1 spectral range are shown in\nFig. 3. A series of Raman bands are observed at 501, 530, 579 and\n623 cm?1. These bands are assigned to the m4 (SO4)\n\n2? bending\nFig. 5. (a) Raman spectrum of sturmanite in the 1550\u20131800 cm?1 spectral range (upper\nrange (lower spectrum).\nmodes. Renaudin et al. [15] found a Raman band at 549 cm?1 for\na synthetic ettringite analogue and attributed this band to an\nAl(OH)6 vibration. We found a Raman band at 530 cm\n\n?1. The obser-\nvation of multiple bands in this m4 spectral region offers evidence\nfor the reduction in symmetry of the sulphate anion from Td to\nC2v or even lower symmetry. The Raman band at 760 cm\n\n?1 is\nattributed to a hydroxyl deformation mode associated with AlOH\nunits. It is likely that the infrared bands at 750 and 878 cm?1 are\ndue also to this vibrational unit. The Raman band at 455 cm?1 is\nascribed to the m2 (SO4)\n\n2? bending modes. Renaudin et al. [15]\nfound a band at 451 cm?1 for a synthetic ettringite analogue and\nassigned this band to a m2 sulphate vibration. The band at\n355 cm?1 with a shoulder band at 383 cm?1 is attributed to a\nCaO and other M\u2013O stretching vibrations. In the far low wavenum-\nber region, a broad spectral feature is observed which may be\nresolved into component bands at 205, 232 and 268 cm?1. These\nbands are simply described as lattice vibrations.\n\nThe Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the 2600\u20133800 cm?1\n\nspectral range is illustrated in Fig. 4a. The spectrum shows two fea-\ntures: bands at 3600 and 3622 cm?1 and a broad feature at around\n3479 cm?1 which may be resolved into component bands at 3276,\n3401 and 3479 cm?1. The first two bands at 3600 and 3622 cm?1 is\nassigned to the OH stretching vibration of the OH units. It is not\nunexpected to observe OH stretching vibrations as the mineral\ncontains B(OH)4 units. It is likely that these two peaks are due to\nspectrum) and (b) Infrared spectrum of sturmanite in the 1200\u20131800 cm?1 spectral\n\n\n\n30 R.L.

The nominal resolution of the Raman\nspectrometer is of the order of 2 cm?1 and as such is sufficient\nenough to identify separate bands for the stretching bands of the\ntwo boron isotopes. The two reduced masses for a pure B\u2013O\nstretching mode would be (10 ? 16)/(10 + 16) = 6.154 for 10-B\nand (11 ? 16)/(11 + 16) = 6.518 for 11-B. The wavenumber is\ninversely proportional to square root of reduced mass; so the iso-\ntopic wavenumber ratio should be the sqrt(6.518/6.154) = 1.03.\n10-B is about 20% of natural boron, so a mode that is mostly B\u2013O\nstretching and that includes significant motion of the B atom\n(not a breathing mode of a BO3 trigonal planar unit or a BO4 tetra-\nhedral unit) should show a large peak for 11-B and a smaller peak\nat higher wavenumber for 10-B.\n\nThe broad feature centred upon 3479 cm?1 is attributed to\nwater stretching vibrations. Renaudin et al. [15] observed the OH\nstretching vibration at 3638 cm?1 for ettringite. These researchers\nfound the water band at 3440 cm?1 and showed the band was very\nbroad. The infrared spectrum of sturmanite over the 2500\u2013\n3800 cm?1 spectral range is reported in Fig. 4b. The spectrum is\nvery broad. Infrared bands may be resolved at 3212, 3410 and\n3594 cm?1 with a broad tail at 2899 cm?1. The first two bands\nare ascribed to water stretching bands. The infrared band at\n3594 cm?1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of OH units from\nthe B(OH)4 units.\n\nThe Raman spectrum of sturmanite over the 1550\u20131800 cm?1\n\nspectral range is illustrated in Fig. 5a. As for the Raman spectrum\nof the OH stretching region of sturmanite, the bands in this spectral\nregion are very broad. A broad Raman band is noted at 1697 cm?1\n\nwith a tail at 1636 cm?1. These bands are attributed to water bend-\ning modes. These bands are also observed in the infrared spectrum\nof sturmanite shown in Fig. 5b. Infrared bands are observed at\n1640 and 1681 cm?1 and are assigned to water bending vibrations.\nThe two infrared bands at 1394 and 1420 cm?1 are due to the pres-\nence of the B(OH)4 units in the sturmanite structure, These bands\nare assigned to the antisymmetric stretching of trigonal boron. A\nsecond possible assignment is to the OH in-plane bending of the\nOH units of B(OH)4 units although the two infrared bands at\n1230 and 1258 cm?1 are more likely candidates for this vibrational\nmode.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have attempted to study the mineral sturmanite a hydrated\ncalcium iron aluminium manganese sulphate tetrahydroxoborate\nhydroxide of formula Ca6(Fe, Al, Mn)2(SO4)2(B(OH)4)(OH)12?26H2O\nfound in the manganese Kalahari fields primarily from N\u2019Chwaning\nI and II mines. Chemical analysis shows a homogeneous phase,\ncomposed by Ca, Al and Si. The mineral contains boron which is\nnot detected by the EDX technique. The mineral sturmanite may\nbe compared with related sulphate mineral ettringite.\n\nIn the structure of sturmanite, one of the sulphate ion groups\nhas been replaced by the unusual ion group, tetrahydroxoborate,\nB(OH)4 with a negative one charge. The minerals sturmanite and\nettringite occur in the same mineral localities and are not easily\nor readily distinguished.\n\nRaman and infrared bands which are attributable to SO4\n2?\n\nstretching and bending modes are observed. The intense Raman\nband at 990 cm?1 is assigned to the SO4\n\n2? symmetric stretching\nmode. It could be expected that Raman and infrared bands which\nare attributable to the B(OH)4 units would be observed. For what-\never reason, the bands are not obvious. One possibility is that the\nbands are under the envelope of the sulphate bands. The infrared\nbands observed at 1230, 1258, 1394 and 1420 cm?1 are due to\nBOH out of plane bending modes. Intense Raman bands at 3600\nand 3622 cm?1 are assigned to the stretching vibrations of the\nB(OH)4 units. Raman spectroscopy identifies some selected bands\nwhich are attributed to the presence of boron as B(OH)4\n\n?.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe financial and infra-structure support of the Discipline of\nNanotechnology and Molecular Science, Science and Engineering\nFaculty of the Queensland University of Technology, is gratefully\nacknowledged.
