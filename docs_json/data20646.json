P. - Computational study of the effects of the confinement and the\ninteracting solutes on the properties of the simplified water-like models\n\nAlthough the familiarity and simplicity, the water show a set of thermodynamic, dynamics\nand structural properties which are still subject to intense research. The increase of density\nas the temperature, of diffusion as the density, or even of ordering with the temperature are\nexamples of some of its unusual behavior. In order to better understand these properties\nnumerous approaches have been used, such as the use of confinement geometries, simplified\nmodels, or ever mixtures. Among the confinement geometries used, are those, nanopores,\nparallel plates and porous media. The porous media are formed by fixed obstacles that\nimpose the additional excluded volume effects to the system. In the case of mixtures, when\nthey occur between liquids able to form hydrogen-bonds, the unusual behavior of water give\nrise to a set even higher anomalous properties. The water-methanol mixture, for example,\nhas a set of excess properties unable to be described by usual theories. Some examples\nare the maximum in the specific heat and minimum in excess volume and enthalpy. In\nthis Ph.D. project, we study by numerical simulations, the confinement of water by porous\nmedia(or under quenched disorder) and the mixture of water with interacting solutes. The\nfirst study is performed using a 2D lattice model which is widely known in the literature.\nIn a second stage, we study the influence of interacting solutes on the properties of lattice\nand continuous models. For the lattice model, we develop a solute model and a technique\nto simulate mixtures of lattice models at constant pressure. Using this technique, we study\nthe excess properties of the mixture. For the continuous model we study the influence of\na dimeric solute on the TMD of a water-like model and posteriorly we study the excess\nproperties of this type of mixture.\n\nKeywords: Water confinement, water anomalies, porous media, lattice models, mixtures,\nMonte Carlos simulations.\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nFURLAN, A. P. - Estudo computacional dos efeitos de confinamento e de solutos\ninteragentes nas propriedades de modelos simplificados tipo-\u00e1gua\n\nApesar de sua familiaridade e simplicidade, a \u00e1gua apresenta um conjunto propriedades ter-\nmodin\u00e2micas, din\u00e2micas e estruturais que s\u00e3o ainda objeto de intensa pesquisa. O aumento\nda densidade com a temperatura, da difus\u00e3o com a densidade, ou ainda do ordenamento\ncom a temperatura s\u00e3o exemplos de alguns de seus comportamentos n\u00e3o usuais. Com a\nfinalidade de melhor compreender tais propriedades in\u00fameras abordagens t\u00eam sido uti-\nlizadas, tais como o uso geometrias de confinamento, modelos simplificados ou at\u00e9 mesmo\nmisturas. Dentre as geometrias confinantes frequentemente usadas, encontra-se, nanoporos,\nplacas paralelas e meio porosos. Os meios porosos s\u00e3o formados por obst\u00e1culos fixos que\nimp\u00f5em efeitos de volume exclu\u00eddo adicionais ao sistema. J\u00e1 no caso de misturas quando\nelas ocorrem entre l\u00edquidos capazes de formar liga\u00e7\u00f5es de hidrog\u00eanio, o comportamento n\u00e3o\nusual da \u00e1gua d\u00e1 origem a um conjunto ainda maior de propriedades an\u00f4malas. A mistura\n\u00e1gua-metanol por exemplo, \u00e9 munida de um conjunto propriedades de excesso incapazes de\nserem descritas pelas teorias usuais. S\u00e3o alguns exemplos, o m\u00e1ximo no calor espec\u00edfico e\no m\u00ednimo no volume e entalpia de excesso. Neste projeto de doutoramento, n\u00f3s estudamos\npor simula\u00e7\u00f5es numericas o confinamento por meio poroso (desordem queched) e misturas\nde \u00e1gua com solutos interagentes. O primeiro estudo \u00e9 realizado usando um modelo 2D\ntipo-\u00e1gua que \u00e9 largamente conhecido na literatura. No segundo est\u00e1gio, estamos a in-\nflu\u00eancia de solutos interagentes nas propriedades de modelos em rede e cont\u00ednuos. Para o\nmodelo em rede, n\u00f3s desenvolvemos um modelo de soluto e posteriormente uma t\u00e9cnica\ncapaz de simular misturas de modelos em rede a press\u00e3o constante. De posse desta t\u00e9cnica\nestudamos as propriedades de excesso da mistura.\n\nPalavras-chave: Confinamento de \u00e1gua, anomalias da \u00e1gua, meios porosos, modelo de\nrede,misturas, metanol, simula\u00e7\u00e3o de Monte Carlo\n\n\n\n\n\nContents\n\nList of Acronyms ix\n\n1 Introduction 1\n1.1 The Water . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1\n1.2 Water confined . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\n\n1.2.1 Porous media . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12\n1.3 Mixtures of associating fluids . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15\n1.4 Objectives and organization of the thesis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23\n\n2 Influence of disordered porous media on the anomalous properties of a\nsimple water model 25\n2.1 The Model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 25\n2.2 The Methods and Simulation Details . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29\n2.3 Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\n\n2.3.1 Structural and thermodynamic behavior . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 31\n2.3.2 Diffusion and dynamic anomaly . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 37\n\n2.4 Conclusion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 38\n\n3 Lattice Model for water-solute mixtures 39\n3.1 The Model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 40\n3.2 Simulation and Numerical Details . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 44\n\n3.2.1 Computation of isobars for pure components . . . . . . . . . . . . . 45\n3.2.2 The properties of mixtures at fixed T and p . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46\n\n3.3 Numerical Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n3.3.1 The phase diagram for pure components . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47\n3.3.2 Critical lines and order parameters . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 48\n3.3.3 The excess properties of the water-solute mixtures . . . . . . . . . . 55\n\n3.4 Conclusions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60\n\n4 Temperature of maximum density and excess properties of short-chain\nalcohol aqueous solutions: A simplified model simulation study 63\n4.1 The Model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 64\n4.2 Simulation details . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 65\n\ni\n\n\n\n4.3 Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 66\n4.3.1 The temperature of maximum density (TMD) . . . . . . . . . . . . 67\n4.3.2 Excess thermodynamic properties . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 72\n\n4.4 Conclusions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 74\n\n5 General Conclusions 76\n\n6 Published articles 78\n\nA Computation of the residual entropy 79\n\nii\n\n\n\nList of Figures\n\n1.1 The water phase diagram shown in reference [1].

In the body it works diluting solids, transporting nutrients and controling the\ntemperature. The water is also emplyoed in the control of temperture in thermal machines,\nin the production of food, in the energy generation, among others. Even though abundant\nand quite common in nature water is not a simple liquid, instead it exhibits a number of\nunusual properties. Actually it has 74 anomalies known to this date [1].\n\nThe peculiarities present on the thermodynamic, dynamic and structural properties of\nwater makes it one of the main representative of the selecteed group known as anomalous\nliquids. Such substances exhibts non-usual properties such as the increase of the density\nwith the temperature, the increase of the diffusion coefficient with the increase of the\ndensity [4, 5, 20] and others. The collective interactions between water molecules plus\nthe effect of the temperature gives rise to the complex phase diagram illustrated in the\nfigure 1.1.\n\nIn the pressure versus temperature phase diagram illustrated in the figure 1.1, it is\npossible to observe three main phases: solid, liquid and gas, separated by first-order phase\ntransition lines (thick lines). The three lines end in a triple point located at Tt = 273.26K\nand Pt = 611.69Pa. At higher temperatures and pressures, the gas-liquid coexistence line\nends in a critical point, located at Tc = 647K and Pc = 2.30\u00d7107 Pa. For the temperature\nabove the critical point no liquid-gas phase transition is observed. At low-temperatures\nmany crystalline structures coexist and they are represented by roman numbers in the\nfigure 1.1. For example, the regions VIII and Ih represent the ice-eight and hexagonal ice\n\n1\n\n\n\nCritical Point\n647K,22.064MPa\n\nLiquid\n\nVapour\n\nSolid\nTriple point\n273.16K,611.657Pa\n\nBoiling point\n373.15K,101.325kPa\n\nFreezing point\n273.15K,101.325kPa\n\n100K,62GPa\n\n278K,2.1GPa\n355K,2.21GPa\n\n218K,620GPa\n272.99K,632.4MPa\n\n251.165K,209.9MPa\n238.5K,212.9MPa\n\n248.85K,344.3MPa\n\nXI\n\northo-\nrhombic\n\nIC Ih\n\nVIII\n\nXV\n\nIX\n\nVII\n\nX\n\nXI hexagonal\n\nIII\n\nV\n\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600\nTemperature (K)\n\n1\n\n102\n\n104\n\n106\n\n108\n\n1010\n\n1012\n\nP\nre\nss\nu\nre\n\n(P\na\n)\n\nFigure 1.1 The water\nphase diagram shown in\nreference [1]. Solid thick\nlines represent first-\norder phase transition\nbetween phases as solid-\nliquid, liquid-vapour,\nvapour-solid. The thin\nsolid lines represent the\nlimit of structures in the\nsolid phase. The roman\nnumbers represent the\ndifferent structures of\nIce. The black dashed\nline represents the\nsecond-order phase\ntransition. The circles\nrepresent the end, criti-\ncal and tricritical points\nand are described on\nthe figure. The gray\ndashed lines work as a\nguide of eyes.\n\nrespectively. The hexagonal ice form is the most popular ice structure. It is the form of ice\nfound in the nature, and give the origin to the hexagonal structure observed in the six-fold\nsymmetry in ice crystals [1].\n\nDespite the richness of the water phase diagram, a region close to 220 K and 200MPa,\nhas received particular attention. This region is located at supercooled temperature, be-\ntween TH = 232K ( the temperature of cubic ice crystallization ) and TX = 150K ( the tem-\nperature of homogeneous nucleation ) [21]. It receives the name of \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d [3,22\u201325]\nbecause system coming from the liquid phases, immediately crystalizes and no liquid phase\nis observed. The large increase in the response function in temperatures surrouding the no\nman\u2019s land it was assumed the possibility of the presence of two metastable liquids. This\ntheory received the name of the second critical point hypothesis (SCPH) [3]. The SPCH [3]\nwas originally formulated based on the experimental results [26] that showed the existence\nof two amorphous phases, a high-density amorphous phase (HDA) and a low-density amor-\nphous phase (LDA), at very low temperatures [26]. The SCPH conjectures, as illustrated\nin the Figure 1.2, that the increase of the temperature would lead, continuously, the HDA\n\n2\n\n\n\n0.20 P(GPa)\n?200\n\n?100\n\n0\n\nT(?C)\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nT(K)\n\nTg\n\nTX\n\nUltraviscous water\n\nLDA HDA\n\nLDL HDL\n\nno man\u2019s land\n\nLLCP\n\nSupercooled water\nTH\n\nStable water\nTM\n\nFigure 1.2 Temperature versus\npressure phase diagram of water.\nLDA and HDA represent the low\ndensity and high-density amorphous\nphases respectively [2] observed ex-\nperimentally. The LDL and the\nHDL represent the low density and\nhigh density liquid phases observed\nonly in simulations [3]. The solid\nline separated by a first-order phase\ntransition these phases. The dot-\nted lines separate the stable wa-\nter from supercooled and the super-\ncooled from \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d and this\nfrom the amorphous region. The\ndotted lines are not real phase tran-\nsitions.\n\nand LDA phases, to the liquid phases called low-density liquid (LDL) and high-density\nliquid (HDL). These liquid phases would be separated by the same first order transition\nwhich divides the amorphous phase (see figure 1.2), however the liquid-liquid transition\nwould end in a critical point known by liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) or the, second\ncritical point (SCP). The critical fluctuations in the vicinity of the liquid-liquid critical\npoints would explain the anomalies present in water. Unfortunately this critical point is\nlocated in a region of pressures and temperatures in which liquid water is inaccessible to\nthe experiments. Water freezes for these pressures and temperatures and the region is\ncalled \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d or homogeneous nucleation region.\n\nAmong the different anomalies present in water, the large increase of the response\nfunctions are the properties more closely related with the hypothesis of the second critical\npoint. The specific heat at constant pressure, cp, and the isothermal compressibility, ?T ,\nare example of these functions. Both cp and ?T show a large increase in the vicinity of\nthe LLCP temperature. This increase never becomes a divergence (which is a requirement\nfor a critical point) because the system crystalizes before reaching the hypotetical critical\ntemperature.\n\n3\n\n\n\nAlthough of apparent agreement of LLCP scenario and experimental results, other sce-\nnarios have been proposed for describing the behavior of water in the supercooled region.\nThe stability limit/critical point free scenario (SL/CPF) [27,28], for example, claims that\nno critical point exists and suggests that a order-disorder transition extends until regions\nof the limit of stability of liquid-water. In a similar way, the singularity-free scenario [29]\ndefends that the increase in the response function of water in supercooled regions is just\na sharp increase but is not related to any critical point. Independently of scenario, the\ndifferent hypothesis states that, at low temperatures the water is composed by two dif-\nferent metastable liquids, a low-density liquid (LDL) and high degree of local tetrahedral\norder [30,31], and a high-density liquid (HDL) with structure more disordered and higher\ncoordination number [32].\n\nIndependent of which scenario is correct, or even, which o them have more experimen-\ntal evidences, it is well known that the water exhibits a considerable amount of unusual\nbehavior popularly, regarded as anomalies. The best known is certainly the anomaly in\nthe density. For normal liquids the density increases with the decrease of the temperature.\nWater has a maximum in the density [4,5,20], Other examples of water anomalies are the\nanomaly in the diffusion, in the translational order parameter, in the orientational order\nparameter, in the viscosity, in the specific heat, in the surface tension, in the compress-\nibility, the relative permitivity, in the dieletric constant and in the solubility. In fact, the\nliterature reports more than 74 different water anomalies [1].\n\nThe existence of the anomalies can not be explained by a simple mechanism as van\nder Waals theory. In the case of the anomalous liquids and in the particular case of water\ntwo length scales are needed. The origin of these two length scales is the presence of\nthe hydrogen bonds in addition to the van der Waals interactions. But, what are the\nhydrogen-bonds [1, 8] ? These structures appear (see figure 1.3) as a consequence of the\nbonds between the oxygen and the hydrogen of distinct molecules. The figure 1.3 exhibits\na water molecule and its four hydrogen bonds with the neighboring water molecules. The\nhydrogen of the upper and left molecules shares electrons of its valence shell with the\noxygen of central molecule, forming two bonds. In a similar way, each hydrogen of central\nmolecule shares its electron with the oxygen of the molecule below. In this sense, a central\nmolecule makes four hydrogen bonds, two as a donor and two as a receptor.\n\nThe set of four molecules of water receives the name of tetramers and as mentioned\npreviously, the arrangement between them is fundamental for understanding the origin of\nwater anomalies. These structures, show two distinct arrangements (see Figure 1.4 (A)),\n\n4\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3 Tetrahedral structure of water. The\nwhite spheres represent the hydrogen and the\ngray spheres are oxygens. Dashed lines represent\nthe hydrogen bonds at distance 1.88\u00c5.\n\none more dense, with high configurational entropy, in which the tetramers tend to be\ncloser to each other, and other forming a less dense structure, more organized and with\nthe tetramers more distant (see Figure 1.4 (B)).\n\nFigure 1.4 Two possible configurations for the octamer. (A) Shows a close structure in which\nthe tetramers are non-bonded; (B) shows open structures and with bonded tetramers [1].\n\nThe competition of these two structures as the temperature is incresead leads to the\nappearance of the density anomaly. At low temperatures, the tetrahedral structure remains\nstable forming all the hydrogen bonds. However, the increase of the temperature distorts\nits tetrahedral geometry sharing and breaking of the hydrogen bonds and as consequence,\napproximating a fraction of neighbor water molecules. This phenomenon of the approxi-\nmation of water particles, or in other words, increasing of the density with respect to the\n\n5\n\n\n\ntemperature receives the name of the anomaly in the density [4,5,20] and its behavior is\nillustrated in the Figure 1.5. As the temperature increases even further entropic effects\ndominates and the molecules become more appart, decreasing the density.\n\n0 2 4 6 8 10\n\nT (?C)\n\n0.9997\n\n0.9998\n\n0.9999\n\n1.0000\n\n?\n(g\n\n/\nm\n\nl)\n\nFigure 1.5 Experimental data\nwater. Figure shows the maxi-\nmum in density as function of tem-\nperature T = 4?C at pressure\nof 1 atm. The figure was taken\nfrom [4].\n\nWhile the density anomaly assumes a central role in the thermodynamic anomalies\ngroup, the diffusion represents a very important dynamic anomalous behavior. As illus-\ntrated in the figure 1.6, for low temperatures the diffusion coefficient increases with the\nincrease of pressure [5] while in normal materials the diffusion coefficient is a monotonic\ndecreasing function with the density (or pressure). The diffusion anomaly belongs to the\ndynamical anomalies group and its origin is in sharing of the hydrogen-bonds. The in-\ncreasing of the pressure induces a partial approaching of water molecules by disrupting\nhydrogen-bonds, increasing the displacement of the molecules.\n\nAs mentioned previously, in addition to density anomaly reported in the Figure 1.5, the\nwater also shows an anomalous behavior on its response functions, such as, specific heat\nat constant pressure cp and isothermal compressibility ?T . While usual liquids increase\nmonotonically their response functions with the increase of the temperature, the water\ndecreases its values until a specific temperature, T ? 35?C for cp (see figure 1.7 (A)) and\nT ? 46?C for ?T (see figure 1.7 (B)), and only after these temperatures, it acquires an\nusual behavior in which they increase as the temperature goes up.\n\nIn addition the anomalies mentioned above, for the temperatures above the supercooled\n(T > TM)regions, the response functions present a \u201cdivergent\u201d behavior as shown on the\ninset of Figure 1.7 (A) [1,33] and Figure 1.7 (B) [1,27] for specific heat and compressibility\n\n6\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6 Diffusion coefficient ver-\nsus pressure for different tempera-\ntures.

At (B) the thermal compressibility against\ntemperature and on inset is shown the peak in this property [1].\n\nusually associated with the presence of criticality in this region, and for this reason is in\ncomplete agreement with the SCPH.\n\nDue to the difficulties of keeping water liquid in the \u201cno man\u2019s land\u201d, computer simu-\nlations have shown to be a powerful tool for the accessing this region. In this way, several\nclassical models of water have been proposed, for example, ST2, SPC, SPC/E, TIP3P,\nTIP5P and SPC/Fw [34\u201338]. These models are commonly known as atomistic models\n\n7\n\n\n\nsince they are built atom by atom. In the SPC (Simple Point Charge) model for example,\nthe water molecule has three centers of concentrated charge, being the atoms H positive\nand atom O negative. These sites are positioned in a trigonal geometry with O-H distance\nequal to 95.48 pm and H-O-H angle equal to 109.42 degrees. The SPC/E, extended simple\npoint charge model is a slight reparameterisation of the SPC model of water, in which the\noxygen and the hydrogen charges present a modified value. Independently on the model\nchosen, both of them show a good agreement with experimental results of the supercooled\nwater and water anomalies, being frequently used to analyze the thermodynamic, dy-\nnamic and structural anomalous behavior of water. The ST2 model [34,39] not only shows\nliquid-liquid coexistence as well as, it presents an incredible agreement with experimental\nresults in relation to the changes in response function at vapor-liquid coexsitence [40] and\npressure-density phase diagram.\n\nEven though atomistic models are a very interesting tool to reproduce the anomalies\nof water, they are not able to identify its origin. They exhibit many parameters and the\ncomplexity of these atomistic models hinders the detecting the main aspects responsible to\nanomalous behavior. In order to explore the mechanism behind the presence of anomalies\nand of the second critical point, the development of coarse-graining models has been an\ninteresting strategy.\n\nThese models are based on the idea that under the influence of the temperature,\ntetramers of water move from opened structures to closed structures as shown in the\nfigure 1.4. This mechanism suggests that the interaction between the tetramers could be\nrepresented by potentials with two scales. A given scale of the potential is identified as a\nminimum on the potential curve. Consequently, a potential with two scales presents a local\nminimum and a global minimum. The location and the characteristic values of different\nscales of the potential, define the emergence of the competitive nature present in liquid\nwater [8,41,42].\n\nThe first two length scale potential was proposed by Stell and Hemmer [6]. They\ndeveloped a ramp like spherical symmetric potential as shown in the figure 1.8(A). Sub-\nsequently, Jagla showed that this potential in three dimensions lead to the presence of\ndouble criticality and anomalies similar to the water [7]. On basis of the assumption of\nStell and Hemmer, a number of spherical (symmetric) two length scales potential have\nbeen proposed [8, 42\u201345]. Unfortunately, not all the two length scale potentials show the\npresence of anomalies. If any of the two of the length scale potentials is too attractive (see\nfigure 1.8(B)) the anomalies will not be present. On the contrary, the cases in which the\n\n8\n\n\n\nattractive scale is present, the double criticality appears. In addition, if the potential is\nnot smooth, the anomalies will also not be present, but double criticality appears [9,43].\n\nThe success of the Jagla model led the development of more realistic smooth potentials.\nSuch models are also represented by two length scales potentials and are known as the core-\nsoftened potential (CS). They do not represent a water molecule but clusters of molecules,\nfor example, the tetramers shown in figure 1.3. These potentials show a repulsive core with\na softening region when particles are very close and an attractive region particles are more\ndistant as shown in figure 1.9. In figure 1.9(A) is shown a two length scale potential with\na very weak attractive part in the spirit of the work of Bell [46] and Jagla [7]. Oliveira et.\nal. [41,43] proposed a two length scale potential formed by a Lennard-Jones potential plus\na Gaussian. This combination results in a repulsive shoulder at short distances and an\nattractive part at long distances being able to reproduce many features observed in liquid\nwater, such as anomaly in density, diffusion, translation order parameter and cascade\nstructure between the classes of anomalies. Following the well potential [9, 47] a smooth\nversion was proposed and analyzed by Franzese [9] and both are illustrated in the figure 4.1.\nThis potential, despite presenting a rather complex structure, it is able to reproduce the\nanomalous behavior of water and also LGCP and LLCP.\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nr?\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.2\n\n?\n(r\n? )\n\n(A)\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\nr?\n\n?1.0\n\n?0.5\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n?\n(r\n? )\n\n(B)\n\nFigure 1.8 At (A) a two length scales potential purely repulsive [6].

In order to circumvent this difficulty, a number of lattice models in which the\nspherical symmetry is broken were developed.

[8]. On inset is presented the force.\nAt (B) is represented a continuous potential with energy barrier more pronounced. This potential\nwas proposed by Franzese et.al. [9].\n\nBell-Lavis model [46,48]. This model and its variations are in two dimensions, the structure\nof water is represented by two states variable. The interactions between water molecules\ncan be of two ways: van der Waals energy and a hydrogen-bond energy. Although of\nsimplicity and low number of adjustable parameters, this model is able to capture the\nanomalous behavior of density and diffusion and also liquid phases [49,50].\n\nFollowing the ideas of Bell-Lavis [46], more recently was proposed the Associating Lat-\ntice Gas (ALG) model. This model combines the occupational variables capable to produce\nliquid-gas coexistence with arm variables that also lead to the density and the diffusion\nanomalies [51\u201353] and in contrast to the Bell-Lavis, liquid-liquid phase coexistence. It is a\ngood example of two length scales potential in a lattice system where directionality is an\nintrinsic ingredient. The inclusion of directionality adds orientational entropy and frustra-\ntion, not present in the spherical symmetric systems. Therefore, when the properties of\nwater depend on the two aspects, the lattice model becomes a good tool for describing the\nsystem. The similar idea gave rise to others directional water-like models [46]. An interest-\ning aspect of this class of the models is that due to excess of the symmetries and the degree\nof freedom intrinsic these models move the second critical point predicted for water into\ncritical lines. Over time, other water lattice models were proposed, among them should be\nmention the model proposed by Franzese and Stanley [54] and the Ciach et.al [55]. The\nmodel of the Ciach [55] is an extension of the well known Blume-Emery-Griffthis model [56]\nwhere the opened and closed structures of the tetramers of water are represented by two\ndifferent states. Through the mean-field approximation, they showed that the model repro-\n\n10\n\n\n\nduce the TMD of water with quantitavive agreement and predicts the liquid-liquid critical\npoint.\n\n1.2 Water confined\n\nAs mentioned previously, liquid water can not be experimentally observed in the \u201cno\nman\u2019s land\u201d due to the homogeneous nucleation phenomena and therefore, the existence of\nthe liquid-liquid phase transition can not be tested. In order to circumvent this difficulty,\nexperiments with confined water have been proposed [57,58]. The idea behind the use of\nconfinement is that a wall disrupts the hydrogen-bonds, in which the formation of ice is\ndisturbed and then moveing the crystallization to lower temperatures in such a way that\nliquid-liquid transition can be detected.\n\nThen, experimental studies and computer simulations of confined water [11, 57, 59\u2013\n61] have shown that the water remains liquid in supercooled regions. This fact suggests\nthe possibility of detection of criticality. Even though confinement moves the melting\ntemperature it does not move it low enough to make possible to observe the LLCP. The\nindirect measures are necessary. The experimental studies measure the diffusion coefficient\nand observe a fragile to strong transition1 on crossing the Widom line [10] (the analytic\ncontinuation of the coexistence line beyond the critical point) as illustrated in figure 1.10.\nIn addition to the possibility to test the LLCP hypothesis, the study of confined water also\nhas been used to modeling biological environment [62] and develop new nanomaterials [63].\n\nSimulational studies of water confined between parallel plates are widely used in lit-\nerature to represent both biological and nanoconfined systems [60,64,65]. In these cases,\nthe temperature of maximum density (TMD) moves to lower temperatures when compared\nwith the bulk temperature, and the system is structured in layers depending on the distance\nof plates. Another type of confinement widely used in literature is the porous media 2. It\nis an interesting alternative to represent the confined structure of the inner rocks on the\nearth and in the cellulose in plants. In addition, the nanopores are the confined structures\nused for testing the double criticality hypotesis [66].\n\n1A fragile to strong , or just, fragile-strong transition, is characterized by a change in the diffusion\ncoefficient, from Arrhenius (D ? e1/T ) to non-Arrhenius.\n\n2Along this text we will use synonyms of random porous media, such as porous matrix, nanoporous\nmatrices, disordered porous, disordered media etc.\n\n11\n\n\n\nW\nid\nom\n\nlin\ne\n\nHDL spinodal\n\ncoexistence\n\nP\n\nPc\n\nTTc\n\nLDL (Arrhenius)\n\nHDL (non-Arrhenius)\n\n?\n\n?\n\n(A)\n\nW\nid\nom\n\nli\nn\ne\n\nLDL\nspin\n\nod\nal\n\nco\nex\nis\nte\nnc\ne\n\nP\n\nPc\n\nTTc\n\nHDL (Arrhenius)\n\nLDL (non-Arrhenius)\n\n?\n\n?\n\n(B)\n\nFigure 1.10 (A) A hypothetical phase diagram.

(B)\nA sketch of the pressure-temperature phase diagram for the two-scale Jagla model. Upon\ncooling at constant pressure above the critical point (path ?), the liquid changes, as the\npath crosses the Widom line, from a low-density state (LDL - non-Arrhenius dynamics) to\na high-density state (HDL - Arrhenius dynamics) as the path crosses the Widom line. [10].\n\n1.2.1 Porous media\n\nPorous media also have shown an alternative not only to study confined water but also\nto technological applications, such as gas storage, heterogeneous catalysis, activated carbon\nfibers and silica gels. Computer simulations of fluids confined in disordered porous structure\nare still a very difficult task. In general, the adsorption properties of this kind of systems\nare exclusive to a given distribution of obstacles that compose the porous media [67]. For\nthis reason, the full understanding of the behavior of fluid adsorbed is necessary realize an\naverage over a representative sample of the disorder. The literature reports many different\ntechniques to generate the porous media. The most used technique consists in simulating\na gas with number of particles equal to number of obstacles of the porous media and after\na given number of simulation steps, the particles suffer a quench, in which they held fixed\non their positions. The simulation box is filled using a grand canonical simulation. This\nprocedure is then repeted in order to obtain different distribution of obstacles and therefore,\nperform an average over the replicas. Another possibility is simulate a gas with number\n\n12\n\n\n\nof particles equal to the number of obstacles plus number of particles of fluid. After a\ngiven number of the simulation steps the obstacles are fixed on their positions, while the\nparticles of fluid are free to move in the porous media. In this case, the procedure also be\nrepeted to obtain more samples of porous media. Although of easy implementation, the\nrelaxation process and the average over replicas demand a very high computational cost,\nand in some cases an unworkable task.\n\nComputer simulations show that the effects of adsorption are strongly related to the\ngeometry of matrix [68]. Strekalova et.al. [11] studied a water-like model confined in\nnanoporous matrices of different geometries as shown in the figure 1.11: a ordered (DIST)\nand random distribution of obstacles (RND). In this work, they studied the influence of\n\nFigure 1.11 At DIST\nis shown a porous ma-\ntrix in which the posi-\ntion of obstacles are ob-\ntained by Gaussian dis-\ntortion of a cubic lattice.\nAt RND the position of\nobstacle are chosen ran-\ndomly [11].\n\ngeometry of porous matrix in a water-like model. They employed two different water-like\nmodels for the interaction potential, a Jagla potential [7] as illustrated in the figure 1.8(B)\nand a CS potential [9] as shown in the figure 4.1(B).\n\nThey show that the influence of obstacles on the TMD and LLCP of the fluid is strongly\nrelated to the geometry of the system. In both cases the LLCP shifts to lower temperatures\nand higher densities and pressures. However, in the disordered confining matrix case, the\nshift of temperature is more pronounced than the density and pressure ones. They also\nshow that DIST geometry preserves the liquid-liquid coexistence, whereas the RND case\nshrinks the region.\n\nA similar idea was explored by Dominguez et.al [69]. Using molecular dynamics sim-\nulation, they studied the changes in the anomalous behavior of a water-like model [41],\nillustrated in figure 4.1(A) due to confinement in disordered porous media. The interaction\nbeetwen obstacles (matrix) and fluid was modelled through the Lennard-Jones potential.\nThey showed that the anomalous behavior is suppressed by the influence of media, mainly\nthe diffusion anomaly. They also claim that is expected that all anomalies disappear if the\n\n13\n\n\n\ndensity of the porous matrix is high enough.\nPage et.al [12] performed Monte Carlo simulation for studing the effects of porous\n\nmedia at vapor-liquid transition in Kaminsky-Monson molecular model [70]. They used\ntwo types of porous media: disordered and face-centered cubic (FCC), as shown figure 1.12.\nIn accordance with other authors [11,69], they showed that the critical temperature moves\nto lower temperatures when compared with the bulk temperature, but this effect is also\ninfluenced by the geometry of matrix. As result the interaction between fluid-obstacles,\n\n(A) (B)\n\nFigure 1.12 Image taken from [12]. Gray large spheres represent the particles of the\nmatrix and black spheres represent the fluid. Two configurations of porous media were\nexplored in this work. At (A) is shown an FCC and at (B) a disordered configuration is\nshown.\n\nthey showed that the temperature-density phase diagram is considerable changed, given\norigin to a new phase and a new critical point, not present in the bulk might appear.\n\nThe effects of confinement of the porous matrix in water-like models are not a exclusivity\nonly of the continuous models. The study of this type of confinement is also used in lattice\nmodels. In these cases, the obstacles are modeled as sites of lattice where the particles can\nnot assume. An example of this approach is reported in Ref. [13], for different fraction of\nobstacles. The figure 1.13(a) and (b) illustrate the implementation of the matrix. They\nobserved that the disruption of the bonds, motivated by the placement of the obstacle,\ndecreasing the liquid-liquid coexistence and give origin to a second critical point, different\nof the LLCP. This behavior is due to the suppression of the fluctuations of the system. The\n\n14\n\n\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 1.13 Figure taken from reference [13].

(c) and (d) are fluctuations of volume and compressibility KT for different\nconcetrations of the obstacles respectively.\n\nplacement of obstacles in the system gives origin a different local ordering, since that the\ndomain of boundaries increase with the concetration and then decrease the fluctuations in\nthe response functions. The same is not true in the bulk system when a small variations in\nthe temperature induces a rapid change from ordered to a disordered configuration, given\nrise a first-order phase transition.\n\n1.3 Mixtures of associating fluids\n\nAssociating fluids is the nomenclature referred to the fluids composed of molecules\npresenting associative interactions. An associative interaction in turn, is an attractive\ninteraction between two molecules which is both short ranged and highly directional. In-\nteraction of this nature shows a saturation phenomena originated by the attractive and\nrepulsive parts of a particle. Hydrogen-bonded fluids, like water, ionic and organic liquids\nare common examples of this group of fluid. Contained in the group of association fluids,\nthe mixture of water and organic molecules corresponds to a very emblematic example\nof the real mixture. In this context, and motivated by its fundamental and technological\nreason, the mixtures of water and methanol have been intensively studied.\n\nWada and Umeda [14] showed that the variation of the temperature of maximum density\nof water moves to higher temperatures as the including of the solute, as shown in the\n\n15\n\n\n\nfigure 1.14. The variations in the TMD (?TMD) are obtained by relation ?TMD = TM?TW\nwhere TM represents temperature of mixture and TW temperautre of water. For this reason,\nthe regions where ?TMD > 0 represent the regions where the TMD increase front of the\ninsertion of the solute.\n\nThis behavior is quite unexpected, since the standard behavior of mixtures is decrease\nthe value TMD. In addition to this conclusion, they showed that the variation of the\ntemperature is strongly dependent on the size of the methyl group of the alcohol. In this\n\nFigure 1.14 Experimental re-\nsult displayed in reference [14].\nThe figure shows the varia-\ntion in temperature of maxi-\nmum density as function of the\nsolute fraction.\n\ncase, as higher the size of the methyl group, higher is the variation in the temperature of\nmaximum density. It is also possible to verify that the range in which the variation in TMD\nis positive is equally affected by the size of the methyl group. In the figure 1.14 the curve\ncorresponding to the t-butanol shows the higher variations and the behavior resists only\nfor very low solute fractions. For the ethanol (red dash-dotted curve), in which the methyl\ngroup is considerable lower than the t-butanol, the amplitude of the ?T is lower, but the\npositive values in ?T resists for higher solute fraction when compared to the t-butanol.\n\nThe excess properties are also widely studied in this context. A given excess property\nAE of a mixture can be obtained by\n\nAE(x2,p,T ) = A(x2,p,T ) ?\n[\nx2A\n\n0\n2(p,T) + (1 ?x2)A01(p,T)\n\n]\n, (1.1)\n\nwhere A(x2) is the value of the property A in the real mixture at solute fraction x2, pressure\np and temperature T and A02 and A\n\n0\n1 are the value of property A of the solute and solvent\n\nin an ideal mixture respectively. A solution is called ideal if each component of the mixture\n\n16\n\n\n\nfulfills a relation like, Ai = xiA0i\n3. Although there is not, actually, ideal mixtures, some\n\nmixtures presents a behavior very close to that described by Raoult\u2019s law. Unfortunately,\nmixtures of the associating liquids can not be, in general, described by this law. The\ninteractions intermediated by short-range attractive potentials and strong directionality\n(e.g. hydrogen-bonds) confer a particular unusual feature to the mixture.\n\nExperimental results for this mixture show that the excess enthalpy [15] and excess\nvolume [16] present a non-monotonic behavior in relation to the solute fraction. The\nexcess enthalpy for example, decreases until methanol fraction close to xMe = 0.35 and\nfrom this value, increase until become an ideal mixture (see figure 1.15(A)). The excess\nvolume in turn, shows a minimum for methanol fractions close to xMe = 0.52 [16] (see\nfigure 1.15(B)).\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n?1000\n\n?800\n\n?600\n\n?400\n\n?200\n\n0\n\n200\n\nH\nE\n\n(J\n.m\n\no\nl?\n\n1\n)\n\n(A)\n\nmetanol\netanol\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n?1.2\n\n?1.0\n\n?0.8\n\n?0.6\n\n?0.4\n\n?0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\nV\nE\n( c\n\nm\n3\nm\n\no\nl?\n\n1\n)\n\n(B)\n\nFigure 1.15 (A) Excess enthalpy versus alcohol fraction. The squares and the circles are\nexperimental data for ethanol and methanol respectively [15]. At (B) Excess volume as function\nof methanol fraction. Circles are experimental data [16].\n\nSimilar to reported in excess enthalpy and volume, the specific heat also presents a\nnonideal behavior in relation to methanol fraction. The excess specific heat at constant\npressure presents a maximum for low methanol fractions, x2 ? 0.16 [71, 72] as shown in\nfigure 1.16. Is possible to list several properties that in a mixture of associating fluids\nexhibit an unusual behavior, the excess free-energy for example also belongs to this group.\nThis property presents a harmonic dependence in relation to the methanol fraction [73].\n\nIn the last years, distinct approaches have been used to study the properties of this\nkind of mixtures. The statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) and computer simulations\nhave been shown a poweful tool to describe the liquid structure of the associating fluid. In\n\n3Initially the Raoult\u2019s law was written in terms of the pressure, pi = p0i xi\n\n17\n\n\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n?1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nC\nE p\n,m\n\n( J\nK\n?\n\n1\nm\n\no\nl?\n\n1\n)\n\nFigure 1.16 Experimental\ndata of excess specific heat at\nconstant pressure in function\nof methanol fraction. The\nblue circles are experimental\ndata and solid line works as a\nguide for eyes.\n\nthis context of the SAFT theory, the Helmholtz free energy is expressed as an appropriate\nfunctions of the parameters and number of different segments representing the chemical\ngroups that make up the molecules. Despite applicability and accuracy of this theory in\nthe description of the phase equilibrium of the associating fluids and their mixtures, in\ngeneral for a good accuracy of thermodynamic behavior of these systems is necessary to\nuse the experimental or/and simulation data.\n\nTraditionally, these type of problems are performed through sophisticated computa-\ntional molecular models. To represent the water several models are used, among then\nSPC/E [36], ST4 [74] and TIP5P [37], on the other hand, to represent the organic molecule,\nin general, are used force fields such as OPLS (Optimized Potential for Liquid State) and\nTraPPE (Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria). In this direction Bak\u00f3 et.al. [17]\nshowed that with the increasing of alcohol fraction, the structure of water maintain its\ntetrahedral structure, however, the number of hydrogen-bonds is substantially reduced.\n(see figure 1.17). In a similar way, using classical MD simulations, Allison et.al [18] showed\nthat not only the hydrogen-bonds decreases, but the water molecules are divided into rings\nand cluster, as well as reported experimentally by Dixit et.al [75].\n\nAnalysis of spatial distribution function [76] showed that the system is highly structured\naround of hydroxyl group and the methanol molecules are solvated by water molecules.\nFace of the difficulty to describe the behavior of water-methanol mixtures by the standard\natomistic models, Gonz\u00e1lez et.al [19] proposed a new force field based on TIP4P/2005\n+ OPLS/2016 to describe the excess properties and the variations on the TMD of the\n\n18\n\n\n\n(A) (B)\n\nFigure 1.17 At (A) the gray lobes represent the spherical distribution function of water\nmolecules around a central water molecule at rOw...Ow ? 3.5.

The blue spheres represent\nthe water oxygen atoms and sticks represent the methanol molecules. Dashed blue lines\nindicate the hydrogen-bonding [18].\n\nmixture. In general terms, the model proposed in the reference [19] is based on the fit\nthe cross interaction parameters from the experimental excess properties over the whole\ncomposition range. The fit procedure was made expressing the dependence of the hE and\nvE with the composition through the Taylor expansion. With these values, they develop\na force-field that can precisely reproduce the thermodynamic properties of the methanol-\nwater system for any composition. The results of this model can be shown in the figure 1.18.\nThe mixture rules added with the new force-field reproduce quantitatively well the excess\nenthalpy and volume (for volume see the reference [16]), while the excess isobaric molar\nheat capacity exhibits a quantitative agreement only for low solute fractions. Based on\nthe success of their model on the describing the excess thermodynamic of the mixture,\nthey studied the variations in the TMD(see figure 1.19). In the figure 1.19 we observe that\nthe model has not the same succes on the description the shift in the TMD. In all models\nstudied by then, the shift in the TMD ?T, are in disagreement with experimental behavior\nin the temperature, exhibiting deviations amounting to about 300% at x2 = 0.05.\n\nFront of the difficult to reproduce the excess thermodynamic and the variations in the\nTMD of water by the classical atomistic models and added to this, the high computational\n\n19\n\n\n\nFigure 1.18 (Left) excess enthalpy for the water methanol mixture and (Right) excess\nisobaric molar heat capacity cEP .

In this approach, the water is fre-\nquently represented by the potentials mentioned in the Section 1.1, whereas the alcohol par-\nticle are represented by a chain formed by attractive and repulsive sites. For the methanol\nfor example (the most simple alcohol molecule) the molecule is frequently represented by\na dimer, in which one of the particle of dimmer represent the methyl group and other\nrepresent the hydroxyl group. In this approach different combinations of hydroxyl-methyl\npotentials have been proposed. Using a Jagla [7] like potentials for the hydroxyl group\nand a hard sphere potential for methyl group, Suet. al. [77] obtain, for a set of parameters\nstudied, a good agreement of excess volume with experimental (see figure 1.20) however,\nfor TMD, their results diverge of the behavior expected for water-methanol mixture [14].\nSome of the discrepancies, the authors attribute to the potential used to methanol-like\nparticles, was the same of water particles.\n\nIn a similar direction, Su et.al studied the mixture of water and alcohol where the\nalcohol is represented by an amphiphilic dimer. The idea of this paper is to reproduce the\nmethyl group of an alcohol by a repulsive particle of the dimer and the hydroxyl group\nof by an attractive particle of the dimer. The water particles are modeled by a sphere\nrepresented by a Jagla potential [7]. In this approach different combinations of hydroxyl-\nmethyl potentials have been proposed. Using a Jagla [7] like potentials for the hydroxyl\ngroup and a hard sphere potential for methyl group, Su et. al. [77] obtain, for a given set\nof parameters studied, a good agreement of excess volume with experimental result (see\nfigure 1.20), where the excess volume exhibits a minimum at fractions of ? = x2 = 0.5\nas shown also in the figure 1.15(B). This result reflects that despite the simplicity, the\nuniversal ingredients that give origin to the minimum in the excess volume are captured by\nthe model. The same thing does not happen with the TMD. The variations ?T in relation\nto the pure water show negative values, diverging of the behavior expected for water-\nmethanol. The authors attribute the discrepancies between experiment and model to the\nsimilarities between potential used to represent the distinct species of the system. Similar\nidea was explored by Hus et. al. [78,79], where the hydroxyl group and water particles are\nmodeled by CS potentials and the methyl group is represented by Lennard-Jones potential.\nThey observe a good agreement with the excess volume but the for enthalpy, the behavior\nof the model is somewhat different of experimental data. They also studied the effects of\nmethanol on TMD of the model, and differently of reference [77], they obtain a qualitative\nbehavior, similar to experimental results [14].\n\n21\n\n\n\nFigure 1.20 At (A) The excess volume versus methanol volume fraction.

Methanol fraction of mixture, at different\npressures.\n\nGiven the impossibility to obtain a universal argument that connect the changes in the\nexcess thermodynamic and the shape of the interaction parameters, Fujiharaet. al. [80]\nstudied the excess thermodynamic behavior for a mixture of LJ particles subject to different\nmixture rules. They adopted four distinct cases given by\n\n?A12 = ?11 A(association) (1.2)\n\n?LB12 = (?11 \u00d7 ?22)1/2 LB(Lorentz ? Berthelot) (1.3)\n\n?ID12 =\n(?11 + ?22)\n\n2\nID(quasi ? ideal) (1.4)\n\n?S12 = ?22 S(solvation) (1.5)\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere the subindex 1 and 2 represent the specie of the particle involved in the mixture\nand ?A12 &lt;?\n\nLB\n12 &lt;?\n\nID\n12 &lt;?\n\nS\n12. In the Figure 1.21(A) is shown the excess volume. Just the\n\ncase A the excess volume is able to assume positive values, but its absolute value is four\ntimes lower than that of the case S for example. The excess volume curves are so negative\nthe higher the cross interacions. It can be understood through the argument that with\nmore strong cross-interactions, particles of different types will be more close, reducing the\nvolume of the mixture in relation to the ideal mixture. In relation to the excess enthalpy,\nthe effects of the temperature are more modest and the cases LB and ID have a behavior\n\n22\n\n\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n?5\n\n?4\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nV\nE p\n\n( c\nm\n\n3\n/\nm\n\no\nl)\n\n(A)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n?1200\n\n?800\n\n?400\n\n0\n\n400\n\n800\n\nH\nE p\n\n(J\n/\nm\n\no\nl)\n\n(B)\n\nFigure 1.21 (A) V Ep and (B) HEp .

In the first\npart we dedicate to understand the changes in the thermodynamic, dynamic and structural\nproperties of a lattice water-like model when it is subject to a disorder. The disorder\nadopted here is a random quenched disorder, commonly referenced by porous media. In\nthis part we obtain the phase diagram of system and study the critical, dynamical and\nthermodynamical properties of system for different densities of the disorder/obstacles. The\ndetails and results of this work can be seen in the Chapter 2 and were published in the\nreference [81].\n\nThe second part we studied the properties of mixture of water models and different\nsolutes. In this part we divided in two different approachs, for the first we studied the\neffect of the attractive and repulsive interactions in the excess properties of a water-solute\nmixture. Here, both water and solute, are represented by a three-dimensional lattice model.\nThe details and results for this part of work can be seen in the Chapter 3 and were published\nin the reference [82]\n\n23\n\n\n\nThe third part of this thesis and then the third Chapter, we extend our study about\nthe aqueous mixtures studing the effects of size of solute in the excess properties of the\nsystem. In this work use a two length scale potential to model the water and dimers\nrepresented by a repulsive particle and CS particle. We studied here, two solutes, one with\na big hydrophobic particle and other with a small hydrophobic particle. The details and\nresults for this part of work can be seen in the Chapter 4 and are submitted to publication\non the Journal Chemical Physics.\n\nAfther these three chapters we ends this thesis with the general conclusions shown in\nthe Chapter 5 and one appendices for explain with more details some thecniques used in\nthis thesis.\n\n24\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nInfluence of disordered porous media on\nthe anomalous properties of a simple\nwater model\n\nThe thermodynamic, dynamic and structural behavior of a water-like system confined\nin a matrix is analyzed for increasing confining geometries. The liquid is modeled by a two\ndimensional associating lattice gas model that exhibits density and diffusion anomalies, in\nsimilarity to the anomalies present in liquid water. The matrix is a triangular lattice in\nwhich fixed obstacles impose restrictions to the occupation of the particles. We show that\nobstacles shortens all lines, including the phase coexistence, the critical and the anomalous\nlines. The inclusion of a very dense matrix not only suppress the anomalies but also the\nliquid-liquid critical point.\n\n2.1 The Model\n\nThe ALG model is defined in a triangular lattice, in which each accessible site i can be\nempty or occupied by a water molecule. Empty sites have ?i = 0 while occupied sites have\n?i = 1. Each water molecule has orientational states represented by the variable ? that\npresents six arms, being two inert arms with ?i = 0 and four active arms with ?i = 1. They\nrepresent the possibility of a molecule to form hydrogen bonds with up to four neighbor\n\n25\n\n\n\nmolecules. The two inert arms are diametrically positioned, in such a way that there are\njust three different orientational states. Fig. 2.1 exemplifies the geometry of the model.\n\n?\n(4)\ni = 0 ?\n\n(1)\ni = 0\n\n?\n(3)\ni = 1\n\n?\n(6)\ni = 1\n\n?\n(2)\ni = 1\n\n?\n(5)\ni = 1\n\n?i Figure 2.1 The occupational and ori-\nentational states of a molecule at the\nsite i.

In this case, the interaction energy between two bonded arms\nreads ?v while non bonded arms contribute with a higher energy of ?v + 2u (punishment\nfor non forming hydrogen bonds).

T/v = 0,\nthe grand potential per site is ? = e?\u00b5N where e = ?H?/L2. At low chemical potentials,\nthe lattice is empty and the system is constrained in gas phase, ? = 0. In this phase the\ngrand potential is ?GAS = 0. Increasing the chemical potential the system reaches a point\nat which the gas phase coexists with a low density liquid phase (LDL). In this phase, the\ndensity is ? = 3/4 and each particle forms four hydrogen bonds with its neighbors, resulting\nin a grand potential per site ?LDL/L2 = ?(3/2)v?(3/4)\u00b5 and consequently in a gas-LDL\ncoexistence chemical potential \u00b5?G?LDL = \u00b5G?LDL/v = ?2. For high chemical potentials,\nall sites of lattice are occupied by particles, resulting in a density ? = 1 and grand potential\nper site ?HDL/L2 = ?3v + 2u?\u00b5. The coexistence between the LDL phase and the HDL\nphase occurs at \u00b5?LDL?HDL = \u00b5LDL?HDL/v = 8u/v ? 6. The main features of LDL and\nHDL phases are exemplified in Fig. 2.2 for two possible configurations at T? = 0.\n\nAt temperatures T? ? T/kBv > 0, the model was also already analyzed by Monte\nCarlo simulations [51]. The chemical potential versus temperature phase diagram is shown\nin the Fig. 2.3(a).\n\n26\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 2.2 Examples of a configuration for the HDL (a) and LDL (b) phases for the Associating\nLattice Gas (ALG) model. The solid and dashed lines indicate the bonding and inert arms,\nrespectively.\n\nThe gas-LDL and LDL-HDL transition lines are first-order transitions, ending in re-\nspective the tricritical points T?c1 and T\n\n?\nc2, respectively. These two tricritical points are\n\nconnected by a line of continuous transitions, the ??line. For the ALG model with no\nobstacles the tricritical temperatures, T?c1 = 0.65 and T\n\n?\nc2 = 0.65, respectively. In order to\n\nunderstand the differences between the LDL and HDL phases, the lattice as shown in the\nFig. 3.2(a) is divided in four sublattices as illustrated in the Fig. 3.2(b). The LDL phase is\ncharacterized by one of the sublattices being empty while all the others are filled, in such\na way that the transition to the HDL phase occurs when the empty sublattice is filled.\nAlso, it is signed by a rotation in the inert arms, in which in the HDL phase they are\nall parallel. In the LDL phase, each particle forms four bonded arms that show a zigzag\nstructure, whereas in the HDL phase each particle also forms four bonded arms but with\nparallel lines.\n\nThe density of bonds, is also an important quantity for characterizing the phase tran-\nsitions and can be obtained by\n\n?hb =\n1\n\nL2\n\nL2?\n\ni=1\n\n?\n\ni+?\n\n?i?i+??i?i+?. (2.2)\n\nAt T? = 0 the gas, LDL and HDL phases has ?hb reading 0, 1.5 and 2,respectively. Thus\nthe phase transitions are also signed by changes in the fraction of hydrogen bonds. At very\nhigh temperature the system is disordered.

This the ??line transition is identified by the peak of the specific heat\nat constant volume cV [51].\n\nIn this work the disordered porous media is introduced by considering fixed obstacles\nthat are randomly distributed in the lattice. Each obstacle occupies a single site and\ninteracts with the particles via a \u201chard core\u201d constraint. The density of obstacles is given\nby ?o = No/L2 where No is the number of obstacles and L2 is the system volume. In Fig.\n3.2(a), a lattice configuration composed of water, obstacles and empty sites is exemplified.\n\n28\n\n\n\n?i\n\n?i\n\n?i ?i\n\n?i\n\n?i\n\n(a) (b)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1 1 1\n\n1\n\n12\n\n2 2\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\n3\n\n3 3\n\n34\n\n4 4\n\n4\n\nFigure 2.4 (a) shows a lattice configuration where the solid gray, the solid black and the dashed\ncircles describe water molecules, obstacles and empty sites respectively. For clarity, the bonds are\nnot shown. (b) shows a lattice configuration with the subdivision in four sublattices.\n\n2.2 The Methods and Simulation Details\n\nNumerical simulations have been performed for the triangular lattices of size L = 35\nand periodic boundary conditions. Three representative values for the density of obstacles\n?o = 0.08, 0.24 and 0.40 have been considered.\n\nIn all cases, we have used 106 Monte Carlo (MC) steps to equilibrate the system and\n106 MC steps for evaluating the relevant quantities. Each Monte Carlo step is defined as\nthe number of L2 trials for generating new configurations, including the choice of empty\nsites and water molecules. Additional simulations for L = 24, 35, 40, 56 and 80 and finite\nsize scaling analysis were performed in order to study the critical lines and to test size\neffects in the porosity.\n\nAll the thermodynamic properties have been obtained by performing grand canonical\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations for fixed T?,\u00b5? ? \u00b5/v and ?0 [47]. Microscopic configura-\ntions are generated according to the Metropolis algorithm [83] described as follows. First,\nthe obstacles are randomly distributed. Then, a site k not occupied by an obstacle is ran-\ndomly selected. If the site k is not occupied, an attempt to occupy the site with a water\nmolecule in a randomly selected arm orientation is made. If the site k is already occupied\nby a water molecule one of the following actions are tried: to empty the site or to change\n\n29\n\n\n\nthe arm configuration of the water molecule to one of the other two possible states. Next,\nto accept or not the attempts to change the site occupation, the energy difference ?H\nbetween the original and the new configuration is computed. The configuration change is\naccepted according to the Metropolis prescription min{1,e???H}, where ? = 1/kBT . As\nmentioned previously, this process is first repeated 106 times without computing and after\nthis, thermodynamic quantities are averaged over 106 Monte Carlo steps.\n\nSome remarks over the obstacles distributions are required. In principle, a random dis-\ntribution might lead to statistical problems. According to some works [84,85], systems with\nrandom disorder loose the self-averaging and averages over many distributions of obstacles\nare required. However, this affects mainly the computation of critical temperatures and\nexponents. In the present case, by performing tests with different random distributions\nof obstacles, we have verified that the tested temperatures and chemical potentials led to\nresults not sensitive to the specific distribution of obstacles. Then, for simplicity only one\nrandom distribution was employed. For calculating the critical ?-line, we considered the\npeak of the specific heat at constant volume, given by\n\ncV =\n1\n\nV T 2\n\n[\n?\n?H2\n\n?\ngcan\n?\n??H?N?2\n\ngcan\n\n??N2? gcan\n\n]\n+\n\n3NkB\n2V\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere ?X = X ??X? with X = H and N and averages are evaluated in the ensemble of\nT,\u00b5 fixed. The chemical potentials and temperatures of the ??line were obtained through\nthe finite size scaling analysis of cV employing L = 24, 35, 40, 56 and 80.\n\nIn addition to the thermodynamic quantities, the influence of obstacles in the dynamic\nproperties was also investigated. Since we perform Monte Carlo simulations, the dynamics\nis characterized through the diffusion coefficient D given by Einstein\u2019s relation\n\nD = lim\nt??\n??r(t)2?\n\n4t\n, (2.4)\n\nwhere ??r(t)2? = ?(r(t)?r(0))2? is the mean square displacement per particle and time is\nmeasured in Monte Carlo steps. Although the diffusion coefficient (measured under Monte\nCarlo simulations) is a stochastic dynamics and not a real space mobility, it is possible to\nassociate the former with the concept of diffusion anomalous like the behavior observed in\nliquid water [52]. The numerical MC procedure for calculating the diffusion is described as\nfollows. First, the system is equilibrated by employing the previous Metropolis dynamics\nfor fixed T? and \u00b5?. After the equilibrium is reached, an occupied site i and it\u2019s neighbor\n\n30\n\n\n\nj are chosen randomly. In case of neighbor site j be empty, the molecule moves to the\nempty site also following the above Metropolis prescription min{1,e???H}, where ?H is\nthe difference of energy due to the movement. A Monte Carlo step t is defined through\nthe number of trials of movement for all system particles. After repeating this algorithm\nnt times, where n is the number of molecules in the lattice, the diffusion coefficient is\ncalculated from Eq.(2.4). Here we employ t = 800 for the evaluations.\n\n2.3 Results\n\n2.3.1 Structural and thermodynamic behavior\n\nFirst, let us exam what happens with the phases present in the system as the obstacles\nare introduced. Fig. 2.5 shows the water density ?, versus the reduced chemical potential\n\u00b5?, for distinct porous densities at the fixed temperature T? = 0.40. Figure 2.5 also shows\nthat for T? = 0.40 the gas-LDL phases exhibits a smaller hysteresis loop when compared\nwith the LDL-HDL transition. This indicates that the gas-LDL free-energy barrier is\nsmaller than the LDL-HDL barrier. This also reflects in the difference between the gas-\nLDL critical temperature, T?c1, that is smaller than the LDL-HDL tricritical temperature,\nT?c2. The size of the hysteresis loops change with the temperature and lattice size but in\nall the analyzed cases the gas-LDL is much smaller than the LDL-HDL loop.\n\nThe inclusion of obstacles changes the temperature and chemical potential locations of\nthe gas-LDL and the LDL-HDL phase transition. In particular, the increase in the number\nof obstacles leads to the disruption of the hydrogen bonds, decreasing the free-energy\nbarriers separating the coexisting phases. This explains the decrease in the hysteresis loop\nwhen obstacles are included. In addition, the density gap between the two liquid phases\nbecomes less abrupt and the inclusion of obstacles moves the transition points to larger\nchemical potentials.\n\nFigs. 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 illustrate the chemical potential versus temperature phase di-\nagrams for ?o = 0.08, 0.24 and 0.40, respectively. In particular, by increasing ?o the\ntricritical points T?c1 and T\n\n?\nc2, in which the gas-LDL and LDL-HDL coexistence lines meet\n\nthe ??line, decreases as shown in Figs. 2.6 , 2.7 and 2.8. More specifically, while for the\nsystem without obstacles the gas-LDL tricritical point is located at Tc1 = 0.65, it moves to\nT?c1 = 0.60, 0.55 and 0.52 for ?o = 0.08, 0.24 and 0.40, respectively.\n\nThis scenario becomes even more drastic in the case of the LDL-HDL phase transition.\nThe tricritical point not only decreases its value from T?c2 = 0.825 (no obstacles) to Tc2 =\n\n31\n\n\n\n?4 ?2 0 2 4\n\u00b5?\n\n?0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n1.1\n\n??\nbulk\n\n??o = 0.08\n\n?4 ?2 0 2 4\n\u00b5?\n\n?0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n1.1\n\n??\nbulk\n\n??o = 0.24\n\n?4 ?2 0 2 4\n\u00b5?\n\n?0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n1.1\n\n??\nbulk\n\n??o = 0.40\n\n?4 ?2 0 2 4\n\u00b5?\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n?hb\n\nbulk\n\n??o = 0.08\n\n?4 ?2 0 2 4\n\u00b5?\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n?hb\n\nbulk\n\n??o = 0.24\n\n?4 ?2 0 2 4\n\u00b5?\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n?hb\n\nbulk\n\n??o = 0.40\n\nFigure 2.5 ? vs \u00b5? for distinct porous densities ?o for T? = 0.40.\n\n0.57 and Tc2 = 0.52 for ?o = 0.08 and 0.24, respectively but the critical line disappears for\n?o = 0.40, implying the absence of liquid-liquid transition line.\n\nThe changes in the transition points can be understood by verifying that the inclusion\n\n32\n\n\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2\n\nT?\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u00b5?\n\n(a)\n\nGAS\n\nLDL\n\nHDL\n\n?-line\nLGT/LLT\n\nT?c2/LLCP\n\nT?c1/LGCP\nTMD\n\n0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.5\nT?\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nc?V\n\n(b)\n\nbulk\n??o = 0.08\n\n0.5 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3\n\nT?\n\n0.70\n\n0.75\n\n0.80\n\n0.85\n\n??\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.6 For ?o = 0.08: (a) Chemical potential \u00b5? versus reduced temperature T? phase\ndiagram showing the Gas-LDL (empty circles), the LDL-HDL (filled circles) phase transitions,\nthe ?-line (empty squares) and the TMD line (filled triangles).

In the case of the LDL phase the\nordered structure is distorted as ?o increases, as illustrated in the Fig. 2.9 for \u00b5? = ?0.5.\nFor the lowest case ?o = 0.08, the degree of confinement is low and most occupied sites\npreserve at least three bonds. As ?o is raised (here exemplified for ?o = 0.24 and 0.40)\nthe fraction of disrupted bonds increases, reaching a limit in which the connectivity of\nthe network is lost. Similar effect is verified in the HDL phase, but the effect is more\npronounced in such case. This can be understood by recalling that in the LDL phase,\nobstacles occupy partially empty sites with neighboring molecules not forming hydrogen\n\n33\n\n\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2\n\nT?\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u00b5?\n\n(a)\n\nGAS\n\nLDL\n\nHDL\n\n?-line\nLGT/LLT\n\nT?c2/LLCP\n\nT?c1/LGCP\nTMD\n\n0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.5\nT?\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nc?V\n\n(b)\n\nbulk\n??o = 0.24\n\n0.5 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3\n\nT?\n0.58\n\n0.63\n\n0.68\n\n0.73\n\n??\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.7 For ?o = 0.24: (a) Chemical potential \u00b5? versus reduced temperature T? phase\ndiagram showing the Gas-LDL (empty circles), the LDL-HDL (filled circles) phase transitions,\nthe ?-line (empty squares) and the TMD line (filled triangles).

Thus, the disruption of hydrogen bonds is more relevant in the HDL phase.\nThis lost of connectivity also explains why the transition from the disordered structure\n\nto the LDL through the ?-line occurs for lower temperatures when compared with the\ntemperatures obtained for the system with no obstacles. For example, for \u00b5 = ?1 and\ndistinct obstacle densities ?o = 0.08 and ?o = 0.24, analysis of the peak of c?V show\n(in all cases) a scaling with L?1, from which we obtain the critical temperatures T?c =\n0.795(1) and 0.717(1), respectively. These estimates are lower than 0.866(1), obtained for\nthe unconfined system. This transition is a order-disorder transition in which one of the\nsublattices becomes empty while the others are filled, consequently the increase of number\nof obstacles increases the entropy by breaking bonds what favors disordered phase.\n\nThus, all transition points, move for lower temperatures as a way for \"compensating\"\n\n34\n\n\n\n0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2\n\nT?\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n\u00b5?\n\n(a)\n\nGAS\n\nFluid\n\nLGT\nTMD\nT?c1\n\n0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3 1.5\nT?\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\nc?V\n\n(b)\n\nbulk\n??o = 0.40\n\n0.5 0.7 0.9 1.1 1.3\n\nT?\n0.52\n\n0.56\n\n0.60\n\n0.64\n\n??\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2.8 For ?o = 0.40: (a) Chemical potential \u00b5? versus reduced temperature T? phase\ndiagram showing the Gas-LDL (empty circles), the LDL-HDL (filled circles) phase transitions,\nthe ?-line (empty squares) and the TMD line (filled triangles).

In other words, due to the inclusion of obstacles, the\nstructured phases exist only for lower temperatures than in the unconfined system, whose\ndecreasing become more pronounced as ?0 increases. Finally, for high density of obstacles\nthe ?-line transition is destroyed by destroyed of fluctuations. The last comment concerns\nin the comparison between the TMD as ?0 increases, as shown in Fig. 2.10. As for the\ntransition lines, the TMD shortens and move for lower temperatures (with maximum ?\ndecreasing) as ?0 increases. However, in contrast with previous results, for ?0 = 0.40 a tiny\nTMD (ranged from T? = 0.50 to 0.70 with ? = 0.56 to 0.64) is verified.\n\n35\n\n\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 2.9 Spatial snapshot (35 \u00d7\n35 sites) of triangular lattice.

(2.4) for different T?\u2019s\nand ?0\u2019s. Similarly with what happens for the ALG model with no obstacles, the diffusion\ncoefficient presents a region in densities in which D increases with ?. This is the so called\ndiffusion anomaly also present in water. The addition of obstacles shrinks the region in\ntemperatures and pressures in which the diffusion anomaly is present and for ?o = 0.40 no\ndiffusion anomaly is observed.\n\nThe dynamic anomaly depends crucially of the presence of a high number of neighbor\nsites occupied by the fluid [86]. The obstacles make this difficult and for a very high number\nof obstacles, the mobility becomes even impossible.\n\nSince for water-like systems, typically the region in the \u00b5?-T? phase diagram in which\nthe density anomaly is present is close to the region where the diffusion anomaly appears.\nTherefore one expects that the suppression of the first is directly related to the disappear-\nance of the other.\n\n37\n\n\n\n2.4 Conclusion\n\nThe effects of fixed obstacles in thermodynamic and dynamic properties of an simplified\nwater-like model have been investigated. For low degree of confinement, the thermody-\nnamic, structural and dynamic properties of model are almost totally preserved due to the\nlow steric effects. For intermediate case, ?o = 0.24, the system suffers significant changes\nsuch as, the decrease of the critical and tricritical points to lower temperatures, resulting\nin a reduction of coexistence regions. This effect is more dramatic for the liquid-liquid\ncoexistence that disappear for ?o = 0.40. The density and diffusion anomalous regions are\nalso shifted to lower temperature, keeping the reduction in temperature-chemical potential\nphase diagram. The disappearance of the liquid-liquid temperature also reflects in the ab-\nsence of density and diffusion anomalous regions in the limit of large density of obstacles.\nBoth effects are related to both the entropy increase due to the presence of the obstacles\nand the disruption of the bonds network.\n\nThis work is published at : Phys.

The nature\nof interaction solute/solvent is controlled by tuning the energy interactions between the\npatches of ALG model. We have studied three set of parameters, resulting on, hydrophilic,\ninert and hydrophobic interactions. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations were carried out\nand the behavior of pure components and the excess properties of the mixtures have been\nstudied. The pure components: water (solvent) and solute, have quite similar phase dia-\ngrams, presenting: gas, low density liquid, and high density liquid phases. In the case of\nsolute, the regions of coexistence are substantially reduced when compared with both the\nwater and the standard ALG models. A numerical procedure has been developed in order\nto attain series of results at constant pressure from simulations of the lattice gas model in\nthe grand canonical ensemble. The excess properties of the mixtures: volume and enthalpy\nas the function of the solute fraction have been studied for different interaction parame-\nters of the model. Our model is able to reproduce qualitatively well the excess volume\nand enthalpy for different aqueous solutions. For the hydrophilic case, we show that the\nmodel is able to reproduce the excess volume and enthalpy of mixtures of small alcohols\nand amines. The inert case reproduces the behavior of large alcohols such as, propanol,\nbutanol and pentanol. For the last case (hydrophobic), the excess properties reproduce\nthe behavior of ionic liquids in aqueous solution.\n\n39\n\n\n\n3.1 The Model\n\nWe consider three systems: pure water, pure solute and water-solute mixture. In the\nthree cases, the system is defined on a body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. The use of the\nsame model for describing the solvent and the solute aims to: identify that the anomalous\nproperties of these systems are related to the presence of hydrogen bonding and to identify\nthe differences in the behavior of the excess properties with the solute-solvent interaction.\nIn our model sites on the lattice can be either empty or occupied by a water or by a solute\nmolecule. Particles representing both water and solute molecules carry four arms that\npoint to four of the nearest neighbor (NN) sites on the BCC lattice as illustrated by the\nfigure 3.1. The interactions between NN molecules are described in the framework of the\nlattice patchy models [87]. The particles carry eight patches (four of them corresponding\nto the arms in the ALG model), and each of the patches points to one of the NN sites\nin the BCC lattice as illustrated in the figure 3.1. The water molecules have two patches\nof the type A (donors), two patches of the type B(acceptors) and four patches of the\ntype D (which do not participate in bonding interactions). The patch D represents the\nnon-bonding interactions that are usually represented by the short-range van der Waals\ninteraction. Since the patches of the types A and B participate in the hydrogen bonding,\na water molecule can participate in up to four hydrogen bonds. The structure of the solute\nis similar to the structure of the water, but it has only one patch of type A, the other patch\nA is replaced by a patch of the type C that represents the anisotropic group which makes\nwater and the solute different. In the case in which the solute is the methanol C is the\nmethyl group while for other alcohols and ionic liquids it does represent larger chains.\n\nThe distinction between patches implies 12 possible orientations for the water molecules\nand 24 possible orientations for the solute molecules.\n\nThe potential energy is defined as a sum of interactions between pairs of particles\nlocated at sites which are NN on the BCC lattice. The interaction between particles i and\nj, which are NN, only depends on the type of patch of particle i that points to particle j,\nand on the type of patch of particle j that points to particle i. The values of the interaction\nas a function of the types of the two interacting patches are summarized in the Table 3.1.\nThe interaction between occupied neighbor sites is repulsive with an increase of energy by\n?ij = ? with the exception of three cases. For patch-patch interaction of type A ? B the\nenergy interaction is taken as: ?ij = ??. If the interaction is of type B ? C, with the\nB patch belonging to a solute molecule there is also an attractive interaction ?ij = ??S?\n(with ?S > 0), whereas if the patch B belongs to a water molecule the interaction energy\n\n40\n\n\n\nSi\nB\n\nA\n\nAB\n\nSi\nB\n\nC\n\nAB\n\nFigure 3.1 Representation of lattice for pure components.

The\nfirst case represents systems dominated by the water-solute attraction. This is the case of\nthe methanol in which it is assumed that the methyl group shows a small but attractive\ninteraction with the water. This also represents the ionic liquids in which the anions\ngroups are hydrophilic and the cationic chains are not too long [9, 88]. The second case\nrepresents alcohols with larger non-polar alkyl substituents [15]. The third case represents\nthe ionic liquids in which the combination of the anions and cations lead to an hydrophobic\n\n41\n\n\n\np(S) D A BW BS C\nD ? ? ? ? ?\nA ? ? ?? ?? ?\nBW ? ?? ? ? ??W?\nBS ? ?? ? ? ??S?\nC ? ? ??W? ??S? ?\n\nTable 3.1 Interactions between NN particles of the same type (solute or water). The\ninteraction depends on the patches of both particles involved in the interparticle bond.\nThe interaction between patches of type C and B depends on the type of molecule: water\n(W) or solute (S) that provides the patch B. We consider 0 &lt;?S ? 1; and ? > 0. Patches\nof types A, B, and C correspond to the four arms of the standard ALG model.\n\ninteraction [9, 88]. Due to the simplicity of our model solute, size and hydrophobicity\neffects are not taken into account independently, but both are considered through the ?W\nparameter.\n\nAt zero temperature for the cases of the pure water and the pure solute systems three\npossible thermodynamic phases can appear in the model: For low values of the chemical\npotential, \u00b5, the stable phase is the empty lattice representing the gas phase at reduced\ndensity, ?? = N/NL = 0, with N being the number of particles (occupied sites) and\nNL the number of sites of the lattice. Increasing \u00b5 a low density liquid phase (LDL)\nappears [89\u201392], where half of the sites of the lattice are occupied by particles (?? = 1/2).\nThese sites are those belonging to one of the diamond sublattices [93] that can be defined\non the BCC lattice. Every patch of the type A is pointing to a patch of the type B, and\nvice versa as shown in the Fig. 3.3(A). In the case of water only pair interactions AB\noccur. In the case of the solute both AB and CB interactions occur. At higher values\nof the chemical potential, the stable phase is the high density liquid (HDL), where all\nthe sites are occupied, and as for the LDL phase, in the case of water, every patch of\ntype A is bonded to a patch of type B and vice versa, as shown in the Fig. 3.3(B). In\nthe case of the solute every patch of type A is bonded to a patch of type B and every\npatch of type C is bounded to a patch of type B. The modification of the ALG model by\nconsidering different types of arms introduce, at zero temperature, a residual entropy per\nparticle s0, that in thermodynamic limit can be written as, s0 = kB limN?? [N?1 ln Q0(N)],\nwhere kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant, and Q0(N) is the number of configurations of the\nsystem, in which every patch of type B is interacting with a patch of type A (or C), and\nevery patch of type A (or C) is interacting with a patch of type B. Using Monte Carlo\n(MC) simulations and thermodynamic integration techniques [94, 95] we have obtained\n\n42\n\n\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\nFigure 3.3 (A) LDL (B) HDL phases. At (B), the colors blue and red are used to facilitate\nthe visualization.\n\nthe values of residual entropy for the water (s(W)0 /kB = 0.41041 \u00b1 0.00002) and solute\n(s(S)0 /kB = 1.10356\u00b10.00002) models. For more details about the computation of residual\nentropies, see Appendix A.\n\nFrom the values of residual entropy we can study the system in ground state. The\nGrand Canonical thermodynamic potential can be written as:\n\n? ??pV = U ?TS ?\u00b5N, (3.1)\n\nwhere U is the internal energy, S is the entropy, and N the number of particles (occupied\npositions). In the Ground State, the stable phase for a given value of \u00b5 is the one with the\nminimum value of ?. Considering the description of the ordered phases explained above,\n\n43\n\n\n\nfor the water model ? take the values (for T ? 0):\n\n?\n(W)\nG (V,\u00b5)/V\n\n? = 0 (?? = 0);\n\n?\n(W)\nLDL(V,\u00b5)/V\n\n? = ???Ts(W)0 /2 ?\u00b5/2; (?? = 1/2);\n?\n\n(W)\nHDL(V,\u00b5)/V\n\n? = ?Ts(W)0 ?\u00b5; (?? = 1)\n(3.2)\n\nwith V ? being the reduced volume (equal to the number of sites). Imposing that in coexis-\ntence the ?(W)G = ?\n\n(W)\nLDL and ?\n\n(W)\nLDL = ?\n\n(W)\nHDL we obtain the values of the chemical potential\n\nand the pressure, at the transitions in the limit of low temperatures\n\n\u00b5 = ?2??Ts(W)0 , pw0/? = 0, G-LDL water\n\u00b5 = 2??Ts(W)0 , pw0/? = 2, LDL-HDL water;\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere the factor w0 = V/NL correspond to the volume per site.

NL ? 65536 where NL = 2L3. The\nsimulations have used ? 8 \u00d7 106 MC sweeps for equilibration and ? 4 \u00d7 106 sweeps for\nevaluating the relevant quantities. Each MC sweep is defined as NL one-site attempts to\ngenerate a new configuration. Each attempt is carried out as follows: i) A site i on the\n\n44\n\n\n\nlattice is chosen at random; this site can adopt ns possible states, Si = 0, 1, 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,ns ? 1\n(ns = 13 for pure water; ns = 25 for pure solute, and ns = 37 for the mixtures); Si = 0\nrepresents an empty site, and the remaining values stand for the different species that can\noccupy the site and their respective orientations. ii) For the selected site, one of its possible\nns states is selected at random, with probabilities given by:\n\nP(Si) ? exp\n[\n?Ui(Si) ?\u00b5(Si)\n\nkBT\n\n]\n, Si = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,ns; (3.7)\n\nwhere Ui(Si) contains the potential energy interactions between site i at state Si with its\nNN, and \u00b5(Si) is the chemical potential of the component associated with state Si. Notice\nthat for an empty site Si = 0, both Ui(Si) and \u00b5(Si) are zero, and that for Si 6= 0, the\nvalue of Ui depends on the states of the sites which are NN of i.\n\nWe have combined the one-site sampling procedure with different advanced techniques\nin order to enhance the simulation efficiency: In the regions close to continuous transi-\ntions, where critical slowing down may be present [96], we have made use of the Parallel\nTempering (PT) method [97,98]. The Gibbs-Duhem integration [99] technique adapted for\nworking in the GCE [87,93] was employed in the location of the discontinuous phase tran-\nsitions of the system. In order to study the excess properties of the mixtures as functions\nof the pressure and temperature we have developed methods to build up isobars for one-\ncomponent systems (See Subsection 3.2.1), and lines at constant pressure and temperature\nwith varying composition for the binary mixtures (See Subsection 3.2.2).\n\n3.2.1 Computation of isobars for pure components\n\nThe excess properties of binary mixtures are usually measured experimentally at fixed\nconditions of temperature and pressure [15,16]. For lattice gas models it is neither straight-\nforward not practical the use of simulation in the NPT ensemble. The usual alternative\nis to carry out simulations in the grand canonical ensemble and compute the pressure by\nmeans of thermodynamic integration. Since we are interested in analyzing the excess prop-\nerties at fixed pressure, we have developed a procedure to build up the lines \u00b5(T|p) for pure\ncomponents, i.e. we fix the pressure and compute the chemical potential as a function of\ntemperature at fixed pressure. The objective is to apply this to the ordered phases: LDL\nand HDL. The pressure at (very) low temperature for these phases can be computed from\nthe ground state analysis. In the GCE the change of the pressure for transformations at\nconstant T and V , is given by dp = ?d\u00b5. The density of the condensed phases at very low\n\n45\n\n\n\ntemperature hardly changes with \u00b5, therefore, we can integrate the pressure to get.\n\np = p0 + (\u00b5?\u00b50) ?0 (3.8)\n\nwhere the values of p0, \u00b50, and ?0 can be taken as those corresponding to the phase\ncoexistence at low temperature (Eqs. 3.2-3.5). Once we now how to compute the chemical\npotential for a given pressure p at a (low) temperature T1, we will develop the integration\nscheme to move on the (\u00b5,T) plane at the fixed pressure p. Imposing dp = 0 in the\ndifferential form for the thermodynamic potential of the GCE we get:\n\nd\u00b5 = ?U + pV ?N\u00b5\nNT\n\ndT = ?u??p + \u00b5?\n?T\n\ndT (3.9)\n\nWe typically considered systems with NL = 2 \u00d7 163.\n\n3.2.2 The properties of mixtures at fixed T and p\n\nThe excess properties of mixing are usually defined as the differences between the\nvalues of the property of the mixture at a given composition, x, and the value of the same\nproperty for an ideal mixture of the components at the same conditions of x, T, and p. It is,\ntherefore, desirable to develop simulation strategies to sample in an efficient way different\ncompositions of a given mixture for fixed conditions of temperature and pressure. In order\nto achieve this aim for our lattice model we have borrowed ideas to form the Gibbs-Duhem\nintegration procedures, as we did for computing isobars of pure components.\n\nThe differential form for the grand canonical potential of a binary mixture can be\nwritten as:\n\n?d\n(\npV\n\nT\n\n)\n= Ud\n\n(\n1\n\nT\n\n)\n? p\nT\ndV ?\n\n2?\n\ni=1\n\nNid\n(\u00b5i\nT\n\n)\n; (3.10)\n\nwhere Ni is the number of molecules of component i, and \u00b5i is the chemical potential of\ncomponent i. If we fix T , p, and V , the chemical potential of the two components can not\nvary independently when modifying the composition. It should be fulfilled:\n\nN1d\u00b51 + N2d\u00b52 = 0 . (3.11)\n\n46\n\n\n\nUsing activities zi ? exp[\u00b5i/(kBT)] to carry out the integration of Eq. (3.11) we get:\n\nN1\nz1\ndz1 +\n\nN2\nz2\ndz2 = 0 . (3.12)\n\nLet us assume that for some values of T , and p, we know the values of the activities of\nthe pure components z(0)1 , and z\n\n(0)\n2 . We can integrate numerically (using simulation results)\n\nthe differential equation:\n\ndz2 = ?\nN1z2\nN2z1\n\ndz1 . (3.13)\n\nFor instance, using as starting point (z1 = z\n(0)\n1 ,z2 = 0) and considering z1 as the indepen-\n\ndent variable and integrating Eq. (3.13) up to z1 = 0, we should reach z2(z1 = 0) = z\n(0)\n2 .\n\nThis condition provides a powerful consistency check of the thermodynamic integration\nschemes at constant pressure. The numerical integration of (3.13) can be carried out using\nthe same numerical procedures as in Sec. 3.2.1. There is still, a minor technical problem,\nthat appears in the limits zi ? 0; where Ni ? 0, and therefore the ratio (Ni/zi) can not\nbe directly computed from the simulation. This problem can be solved by applying the\nWidom-insertion test technique [95] to compute the activity of the minority component\n(which actually has mole fraction x = 0) as a function of its density. The result can be\nwritten as:\n\nlim\nzi?0+\n\n??i\nzi\n\n= qi ?exp [??ui/(kBT)]? ; (3.14)\n\nwhere ?exp [??ui/(kBT)]? represents the average of the Boltzmann exponential over at-\ntempts of insertion of a test particle of type i with random position and random orientation\non a pure component system of the other component and qi is the number of possible ori-\nentations for molecules of type i. Results were obtained from simulations of systems with\nNL = 2 \u00d7 163.\n\n3.3 Numerical Results\n\n3.3.1 The phase diagram for pure components\n\nThe chemical potential vs. temperature phase diagrams are shown in the Fig. 3.4\nfor the pure water and for the pure solute. Three different phases, G, LDL, and HDL\nappear, as expected. At low temperature, there are two, G-LDL and LDL-HDL first-order\ntransitions, as shown in the figure 3.5 and 3.6.\n\n47\n\n\n\nThe first order LDL-HDL transition finishes, both for water and solute, in a liquid-liquid\ntricritical point (LLTCP). The LLTCPs occur at T?tc ' 0.59 and \u00b5?tc ' 1.67 for water and at\nT?tc = 0.25 \u00b5\n\n?\ntc = 2.42 the solute. Above Ttc the LDL-HDL transition becomes continuous\n\nand defines the ??line (See Fig. 3.4). At high temperature, it appears a continuous\ntransition between G and HDL phases (??line in Fig. 3.4).A liquid-liquid transition (LLT)\nas shown in the figure 3.4 is also observed in molecular liquids. Experimental evidences\nsuggest the existence of two liquid phases in the triphenyl-phosphite [100\u2013102] and in the\nn-butanol [103]. In addition, Monte Carlo simulations, Hus et al. [78] showed that this\ntype of transition is observed in isotropic models for methanol.\n\nThe coexistence line between the G and LDL phases for water extends up to a bicritical\npoint (LGBCP) [104] located at T?bc ' 1.00 and \u00b5?bc ' ?0.22. At this LGBCP the G-\nLDL transition meets the lines for the critical G-HDL (??line) and LDL-HDL (??line)\ntransitions. In the case of solute, the G-LDL first order transition meets the ?-line at an\nend point located at T?t ' 0.74, \u00b5?t ' 0.86. Above this temperature there is a G-HDL\nfirst order transition up to a tricritical point (LGTCP) located at T ??tc ' 0.85, \u00b5??tc = 0.84.\nAbove this temperature the G-HDL transition becomes continues and defines the ?-line\nThe details of the calculation of the critical. lines are explained in the Appendix 3.3.2.\n\nGas-liquid transition in patchy associative lattice models is nothing a new. Tavares\net al. [105], showed that systems of this nature not only have this kind of coexistence\nbut, depending on the ratio between the interactions of the patches (we are above this\nratio), the coexistence line can presents a reentrant behavior, and closed miscibility loop.\nPapaioannou et al. [106] showed that for the case of water and methanol, the gas-liquid\ncoexistence can be obtained through the SAFT-? Mie group with excellent accuracy in\nrelation to the experimental data.\n\n3.3.2 Critical lines and order parameters\n\nThe ??line\n\nThe continuous ? and ? transitions, illustrated in the figure 3.4 are represented by thin\nlines and circles. The values of the temperatures and chemical potentials for the criti-\ncal lines were obtained by computing appropriated order parameters and their associated\nmoments or cumulants.\n\nIn the case of the ? line, the ?? order parameter is defined as follows. The system\nis divided into eight sublattices [91].

The occupancy of the sites and orientations of the arms (patches of types\nA, B and C) is well defined for each LDL realization. The realizations of the lattice\nare obtained by a union of even/odd sites belonging to a BCC lattice. The sites are\nrepresented by (2i, 2j, 2k) and (2i + 1, 2j + i, 2k + 1) with i, j,and k integers. An example\nof the subsets Si can be: S1 = {(000), (022), (202), (220)}, S2 = {(002), (020), (200), (222)},\nS3 = {(111), (331), (133), (313)} and S4 = {(131), (311), (113), (333)}. The realizations Di\n(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) are then obtained by union of the subsets Si,\n\nD1 ?S1 ?S3 , D2 ?S1 ?S4 ,\n\nD3 ?S2 ?S3 , D4 ?S2 ?S4 .\n\nresulting in four possible realizations.\nTaking into account the orientation of the occupied sites on a given configuration, we\n\n51\n\n\n\ncan compute the number of particles in the system compatible with each of the four LDL\nrealizations. Let ni, with i = 1, 2, 3, 4 be those numbers. From each configuration, we can\nsort the ni values so that na ? nb ? nc ? nd, and compute their corresponding densities\n?a = na/NL,?b = nb/NL \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . In the thermodynamic limit (NL ??), we expect for the G\nphase: ?a ' ?b ' ?c ' ?d ' ?/4. For the HDL phase ?a ' ?b ? ?c ' ?d, and finally for\nthe LDL phase ?a ? ?b. Accordingly the presence of the LDL phase can be detected by\nan order parameter, O? ,given by\n\nO? = ?a ??b; (3.16)\n\nThe system size dependence of the shape the O? distribution can be analyzed by looking\nat the ratio [96]:\n\ng4? =\n?O4??\n?O2??\n\n2\n; (3.17)\n\nwhere the angular brackets represent average values. In figure 3.8, we show the results\nfor ?O?? and g4? as functions of the chemical potential for various lattice sizes and at\nT? = 0.80. The crossing of the lines of g4? for different values of L locate the critical\nchemical potential at that temperature, i.e, the corresponding point of the ??line.\n\nComplementary to the study of the ?? and O? order parameters described above, the\nbehavior of the specific heat at constant volume for different system sizes were analyzed.\n\nAt criticality, it is expected that the specific heat would show a divergence as the\nthermodynamic limit is approached. The finite-size scaling behavior of the critical exponent\nof the specific heat, ?, gives the critical behavior at the infinite system [96]. The heat\ncapacity at constant volume ( per lattice site) cV = (?U/?T)N,V /V is computed from the\ndata obtained from simulations at constant chemical potential through the expression [94],\n\ncV =\n1\n\nkBT 2V\n\n[\n?\n?U2\n\n?\n? ??U?N?\n\n2\n\n??N2?\n\n]\n. (3.18)\n\nHere U is the interaction energy of model described in the Table 3.1, and N is the\nnumber of particles. The averages in Eq. (3.18) are carried out on the grand canonical\nensemble.\n\nThe figure 3.9 shows the specific heat at constant volume versus temperature at constant\n\u00b5, illustrating the diverging peak at T? ' 0.9 for the pure water system and at T? ' 0.6\nfor the pure solute, as L increases. The peak in the heat capacity cV in addition to the O?\nand ?? behavior is employed to locate the ??line.\n\n52\n\n\n\n1.36 1.38 1.40 1.42 1.44\n\u00b5?\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n?\n? ?\n\n,\n?\n?\n\n(A)\n\nL = 8\nL = 16\nL = 32\n\n1.36 1.38 1.40 1.42 1.44\n\u00b5?\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\n0.25\n\nO?\n\n(B)\n\nL = 8\nL = 10\nL = 12\nL = 14\nL = 16\nL = 18\nL = 20\nL = 24\nL = 28\nL = 32\n\n1.36 1.38 1.40 1.42 1.44\n\u00b5?\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\ng\n4\n?\n\n(C)\n\nL = 8\nL = 10\nL = 12\nL = 14\nL = 16\nL = 18\nL = 20\nL = 24\nL = 28\nL = 32\n\nFigure 3.8 Location of the contin-\nuous LDL-HDL transitions for the\nwater model at T? = 0.80 and dif-\nferent system sizes: NL = 2L3.

An order parame-\nter based on the symmetry of the ALG model can be defined to quantify the HDL ordering\nof the configurations. The BCC lattice can be splitted into two interpenetrated cubic\nsublattices. In the HDL structure, each sublattice adopts a different but complementary\norientation. The appropriate order parameter for the ?-line is given by\n\nO? =\n1\n\nNL\n\n?????\nNL?\n\ni=1\n\nl(i)s(i)\n\n????? , (3.19)\n\nwhere l(i) assumes +1 if a sublattice is formed by even sites and ?1 if it is formed by a\nodd sites. s(i) represents the orientation of the particles in the site i. Particles with arms\norientated to, (i,j,k) = {(1, 1, 1); (?1,?1, 1); (?1, 1,?1); (1,?1,?1)} receive s = +1, to\n(i,j,k) = {(?1, 1, 1); (1 ? 11); (1, 1,?1); (?1,?1,?1)} receive s = ?1, and empty sites\nreceive s(i) = 0. This order parameter is analogous to that for antiferromagnetic Ising\nmodels in bipartite lattices. In the figure 3.10 we show the shape of the order parameter\nat the HDL-G transition (top panels). For the G phase O? vanishes in the thermodynamic\nlimit while for the HDL it remains finite. The approximate location of the transition is\nobtained by the crossing of the curves for different sizes. Even though the behavior of the\norder parameter illustrates how the structure of the phases change at the phase transition,\nit does not provide the precise temperature and chemical potential. The precise location\n\n54\n\n\n\nof the transitions can be achieved by looking at the system size dependence of the ratio,\ng4?:\n\ng4? =\n?O4??\n?O2??\n\n2\n, (3.20)\n\nwhere the brackets indicate average over grand canonical simulations. At the ?-line tran-\nsition, it is expected that the values of g4? become independent of the system size. The\nfigure 3.10, examples for water and solute of the behavior of g4? (T,NL) for fixed \u00b5, at the\nG?HDL transition (?? line) are presented. The value of g4? at the crossing region, to-\ngether with the form of the order parameter suggest three-dimensional Ising criticality. In\naddition the location of the ?-line can be confirmed by the divergence of the heat capacity.\n\n3.3.3 The excess properties of the water-solute mixtures\n\nNext, we explore the mixture of water and solute. The thermodynamic excess properties\nof the mixture are defined by comparing the values of a given extensive property per mol\n(or per molecule) with the values of this quantity for an ideal mixture. In the case of the\nexcess volume we have:\n\nV? E(x,p,T ) = V? (x,p,T ) ?\n[\n(1 ?x)V? 01 (p,T) + xV? 02 (p,T)\n\n]\n; (3.21)\n\nwhere V? (x,p,T ) is the volume per molecule of the mixture at molecular fraction x of the\nsolute (component 2) x (i.e. x ? x2), V? 01 (p,T) and V? 02 (p,T) are the volumes per molecule\nof the pure solvent (component 1) and pure solute respectively.\n\nThe thermodynamic properties for different compositions at constant T and p were\ncomputed using GCE simulations coupled to the integration schemes explained in Appen-\ndices 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. In practice, for one component systems we apply an integration\nscheme to find the line, \u00b5(T|p) in the plane \u00b5?T that corresponds to a fixed value, p of\nthe pressure, and for the mixtures we calculate the line \u00b51(\u00b52|T,p) in the plane \u00b51 ? \u00b52\nthat keep fixed the values of T and p.\n\nThe volumes per molecule were estimated from the simulations as: V? = V/?N?. The\nenthalpy, H of a given system is given by H = U + pV , where U is the internal energy\n(given for the patch-patch interactions). The enthalpy per molecule can be estimated\nas: H? = [?U? + pV ]?N?. Whereas the mole fraction for given values of the activities\nzi = exp [?\u00b5i/(kBT)], is computed as: ?x?' ?N2?/?N?.\n\nThe integration procedure provides the results for the different properties at equally\n\n55\n\n\n\nspaced discrete values of the activity, z, of one of the components, (say component 1)\nwhich span from z1 = z\n\n(0)\n1 (pure solvent) to z1 = 0 (pure solute). For each of these cases\n\nthe properties of interest, x(z1), V? (z1), H?(z1), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 are computed. Then, to estimate the\ndependence of the molar properties with the composition these properties are fitted to\npolynomials of x as:\n\nY?f (x,T,p) =\n\njmax?\n\nj=0\n\na\n(Y )\nj (T,p)x\n\nj. (3.22)\n\nThe degree of the polynomial, jmax, is chosen according to statistical criteria, ensuring\nthat the fitted function provides a good description of the values of the property in the\nwhole range x ? [0, 1]. Using the functions given in Eq. (3.22) the excess properties for\nthe volume or the enthalpy are computed as a function of x as:\n\nY? E(x,T,p) = Y?f (x,T,p) ?xY?f (1,T,p) ? (1 ?x)Y?f (0,T,p). (3.23)\n\nThe ?W = ?S = 0.25 case\n\nFirst, we analyze the case in which the B-C solvent-solute and solute-solute interactions\nare both attractive and they have the same value namely ?W = ?S = 0.25. This represents a\nsystem in which in addition the solvent interacts with the solute in two different ways, B-A\nand B-C, both attractive. In principle this would be the case of the water - alcohol mixture\nwhere water forms hydrogen bonds with the alcohol and shows and effective attraction with\nthe alkyl group.\n\nThe figure 3.11 illustrates the excess volume for the pressure and temperature p? = 0.10\nand T? ' 0.3. For the pure solvent, this point is at a temperature below the temperature\nof maximum density. As the fraction of the solute increases, the excess volume decreases\nuntil it reaches a minimum. The presence of this minimum in a water-solute system is\nobserved in the water-methanol [16,71,107\u2013109], in the water-ethanol [110], in the water-\nalkanolamines [111,112] and in the water-hydrophilic ionic liquids [113] solutions.\n\nThe negative value of the excess volume can be understood as follows. The excess\nvolume for mixtures originates from the competition between energy and entropy [80,114].\nSince the solvent-solvent is more attractive than the solute-solvent, the energetic balance\nfavors the solution to occupy a larger volume [80,114]. However, the excess volume has a\ncontribution from the entropy. As solute is added to the system the phase diagram shrinks\nand the phases are shifted to lower temperatures and higher densities [92,115]. In the case\nof non anomalous systems, discribed by a Lennard-Jones potential, this shift in the phase\n\n56\n\n\n\ndiagram is not relevant and in the case of ?W = ?S the excess volume is positive [80].\nIn our system due to the different orientations of the solute, the entropic effect is more\nrelevant and the excess volume is negative.\n\nThe figure 3.11 also shows the excess enthalpy for our model as a function of the fraction\nof the solute. The minimum observed in HE is also present in the in water-methanol [116],\nwater-ethanol [117], water-alkanolamines- [118] and in water with hydrophilic ionic liq-\nuids [113] solutions.\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n?0.25\n\n?0.15\n\n?0.05\n\nV ?E\n(A)\n\nT? = 0.345\nT? = 0.350\nT? = 0.355\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n?0.06\n\n?0.04\n\n?0.02\n\n0.00\n\nH?E (B)\n\nT? = 0.345\nT? = 0.350\nT? = 0.355\n\nFigure 3.11 (A) excess volume and (B) excess enthalpy per particle as a function of solute\nconcentration for ?S = 0.25,?W = 0.25, p? = 0.10 and several temperatures.\n\nThe figure 3.12 illustrates snapshots of the system as the concentration of the solute\nis increased. Since the system is in the LDL phase of the solvent, there is one sublattice\nempty while the other is filled. In the case in which the solute is a hard sphere, as the\nsolute is added to the system it enters in the empty sublattice not competing with the\nsolvent occupation [92]. Here this is not the case. The solute enters in the same sublattice\noccupied by the solvent.\n\nThe excess enthalpy is a combination of the excess internal energy and the excess volume\n(HE = UE + pV E). The excess volume is negative as explained above. The excess internal\nenergy of the mixture is positive due to the solvent-solute less attractive interaction when\ncompared with the solvent-solvent interaction. The balance between these two competing\nterms for the ?W = 0.25 leads to a small but negative excess enthalpy.\n\n57\n\n\n\n(B) (C)\n\nFigure 3.12 The snapshot of system for ?W = 0.25 and T? = 0.350. The blue and\nred spheres represent the water and solute respectively. At (A)-x2 = 0.024105, (B)-x2 =\n0.704341 and (C)-x2 = 1.\n\nThe ?W = 0 and ?S = 0.25 case\n\nNext, we analyze the case in which the B-C solute-solute patch is attractive but the\nB-C solvent-solute patch has no interaction. In this case ?W = 0 while the solute-solute\nB-C is attractive namely ?S = 0.25. This represents a system in which in addition the\nsolvent interacts with the solute only through the B-A patch. In principle, this would be\nthe case of the water-alcohol mixture in which the alkyl group is larger than the preceding\ncase and therefore the molecule is less hydrophilic.\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n?0.10\n\n?0.06\n\n?0.02\n\n0.02\n\nV ?E\n\n(A)\n\nT? = 0.300\nT? = 0.310\nT? = 0.320\nT? = 0.330\nT? = 0.340\nT? = 0.350\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n0.00\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\nH?E\n\n(B)\n\nT? = 0.300\nT? = 0.310\nT? = 0.320\nT? = 0.330\nT? = 0.340\nT? = 0.350\n\nFigure 3.13 (A) Excess volume and (B) Excess enthalpy versus fraction of solute for\nvarious temperatures, ?W = 0, ?M = 0.25 and p? = 0.10.\n\nThe figure 3.13 illustrates the excess volume and the excess enthalpy as a function of\n\n58\n\n\n\nthe fraction of the solute for various temperatures.\nThe excess volume here as in the previous case, is a combination of energy and entropy.\n\nThe energy of the mixture is much higher than the entropy of each pure system what\ncontributes to a positive excess volume. The entropy is still more relevant and the excess\nentropy is larger than in the previous case but it is still negative.\n\nThe excess enthalpy (HE = UE + pV E) is composed of a small negative excess volume\nand a excess energy that is positive because both the solvent-solvent and solute-solute\ninteraction are more attractive than the solute-solvent interaction. So, in this case the\nexcess enthalpy is positive.\n\nThis behavior is consistent with the excess volume and enthalpy of mixtures of water\nand large alcohol molecules such as propanol, butanol and pentanol [15,119].\n\nThe ?W = ?0.25 and ?S = 0.25 case\n\nFinally, we analyze the case in which the B-C solute-solute patch is attractive but the\nB-C solvent-solute patch is repulsive. In this case, ?W = ?0.25 is repulsive while the\nsolute-solute B-C is attractive namely ?M = 0.25. This represents a system in which in\naddition the solvent interacts with the solute through the B-A with attraction probably\nforming hydrogen bonds while show repulsion through the B-C patch. In principle, this\nwould be the case of the water mixing with molecules that exhibit a hydrophilic region, and\neventually, can form a hydrogen bond, but the overall water-solute interaction is repulsive.\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n?0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\nV ?E\n\n(A)T? = 0.280\nT? = 0.300\nT? = 0.320\nT? = 0.340\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\nx2\n\n0.01\n\n0.03\n\n0.05\n\n0.07\n\nH?E\n\n(B)\n\nT? = 0.295\nT? = 0.315\nT? = 0.335\n\nFigure 3.14 (A) Excess volume and (B) excess enthalpy versus fraction of methanol for\nvarious temperatures. ?W = ?0.25, ?M = 0.25 and p? = 0.10.\n\n59\n\n\n\nThe figure 3.14 illustrates the excess volume and the excess enthalpy as a function of\nthe fraction of the solute for various temperatures. This behavior is found in hydrophobic\nionic liquids [113,120].\n\nIn this last case, the solute-solvent energy is much larger than the solute-solute and\nsolvent-solvent interaction, so the entropic effect is not enough and the excess volume is\npositive. Similarly the enthalpy that is a combination of this positive excess energy and\nexcess volume is also positive.\n\nIt is important to notice that these three effects of both negative excess functions, one\nnegative and one positive and both negative by controling the solvent-solute from mildly\nattractive to repulsive would not be obtained in a Lennard-Jones type of fluid in which the\norientational degrees of freedom is not present.\n\n3.4 Conclusions\n\nIn this paper, a combination of two Associating Lattice Models is employed to represent\na mixture of solute and solvent. The idea is to explore the effect of the orientational degrees\nof freedom present in the model and of the solute-solvent energy in the excess properties\nof the mixture.\n\nThe ALG model in the range of parameters employed for discribing the solvent exhibits\nthe density and diffusion anomalous behavior present in water. The solute is modeled by\nmolecules that form two types of bonds with water: one attractive hydrogen bond-like, the\nA-B interaction, plus an additional, tunable, B ?C interaction.\n\nThe pure components, by construction, present very similar phase diagrams. Both\npresent, first (G-LDL/LDL-HDL) and second order (??line/??line) transitions, as well\nas some multicritical points. The phases in coexistence are also the same. The difference\nbetween solute and solvent is in the critical temperatures and the location of the temper-\nature of maximum density, at extremely low temperatures for the case of the solute.\n\nFor the mixture, by tuning only one parameter, the B-C patch, from attractive to re-\npulsive the model qualitatively reproduce the behavior of the excess volume and enthalpy\nof different types of mixtures that represent solutes ranging from hydrophilic to hydropho-\nbic.\n\n60\n\n\n\nThe mapping of the relative hydrophobicity of the solutes through the ?W parameter\nof the model, allows us to explain the trends of the excess properties of the mixtures as\nfunction of the intermolecular effective interaction.\n\nOur results indicate that when the balance between the solute-solute plus the solvent-\nsolvent energies are lower than the solvent-solute energy but solute-solvent is hydrophilic,\nthe entropic contribution for the excess volume makes it negative and the excess enthalpy\nalso negative.\n\nWhen the solute-solvent is hydrophobic the excess energy is very positive so the excess\nvolume becomes positive. The same applies to the excess enthalpy.\n\nOur result even though based on a very simple model reproduce a mechanism that\nseems to be present in a large variety aqueous solutions.\n\nThis work is published at : J.

Water molecules are represented by a well studied core softened\npotential which is known to qualitatively account for a large number of water\u2019s characteris-\ntic anomalies. Along the same lines, alcohol molecules are idealized by dimers in which the\nhydroxyl groups interact with each other and with water with a core softened potential as\nwell. Interactions involving non-polar groups are all deemed purely repulsive. We find that\nthe qualitative behavior of excess properties (excess volume, enthalpy and constant pres-\nsure heat capacity) agrees with that found experimentally for alcohols such as t-butanol\nin water. Moreover, we observe that our simple solute under certain conditions acts as\nan \u201cstructure-maker\u201d, in the sense that the temperature of maximum density of the bulk\nwater model increases as the solute is added, i.e. the anomalous behavior of the solvent is\nenhanced by the solute.\n\n63\n\n\n\n4.1 The Model\n\nAs mentioned above, we will have spherical particles representing water-like molecules,\ntogether with an amphiphilic solute with a purely repulsive site accounting for the apolar\ntail, R, in addition to an OH site, characterized by OH-OH and OH-water interactions\nwith two length scales [44]. A short range repulsion accounts for the high density liquid\nphase, and a much longer range repulsion and attraction attempts to roughly model the\nmore open structures due to hydrogen bonding. To make matters simpler, we will use the\nsame the softened-core potential both for water-water, OH-OH and OH-water interactions,\ndefined by,\n\nUsc(rij) = 4?sc\n\n[(\n?\n\nrij\n\n)12\n?\n(\n?\n\nrij\n\n)6]\n+\n\n1?\n\n`=0\n\nu`?sc exp\n\n[\n? 1\nc2`\n\n(\nrij ? r`\n?\n\n)2]\n.

Of the many possible choices of two-scale potentials, ours\nhas been motivated by its ability to account for many of the anomalous features of fluid\nwater [5,44,121], displaying the characteristic cascade ordering of anomalies [30]. For the\nparameters chosen in this work, the model is known to display a density anomaly with\na TMD curve in the supercritical region [44]. The attractive well that can be seen in\nFigure 4.1 is not sufficient to place the anomalous region within the stable liquid phase, in\ncontrast with the situation in real water. Despite these limitations, as already mentioned,\nthis model potential is an excellent candidate to reproduce water anomalies [44].\n\nThe non-polar site-site interactions (R-R, R-OH, and R-water) are represented by a\npurely repulsive Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential (WCA) [122] of the form\n\nUr(rij) =\n\n{\nULJ(rij) ?ULJ(rc) if r ? rm\n0 if r > rm\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere, ULJ(r) is the standard 12-6 LJ potential with parameters (?r,?r), and ULJ(rm) is\nthe LJ potential computed at cutoff distance given by the position of the minimum of the\nLJ interaction, rm = 21/6?r.\n\n64\n\n\n\nIn what follows we have used as unit length, ?=?ww = ?w?OH = ?OH?OH, and as\nenergy unit, ?sc. Reduced pressure and temperature are defined as P? = P?3/?sc and\nT? = kBT/?sc, where kB is Boltzmann\u2019s constant. The simulation time step is given in\nreduced units of ? = ?\n\n?\nm/?sc, where m is one of the particle masses. Since here we are\n\nnot interested in dynamic properties, we have considered all particle masses identical.\nAs mentioned, we have considered an heteronuclear model, in which ?r/? = 5/3 (a\n\nrough model for tert-butanol), and a homonuclear model in which ?r/? = 1.\nThe energy parameter of the repulsive interaction was set to ?r/?sc = 1.21, and the dimer\n\nbond length to dR?OH = 0.48?. This choice of parameters was to some extent inspired by\nthe OPLS force field widely used to simulate alcohols [123]. Cross interaction parameters\nwere computed using Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules [94]. A graphical representation of\nour molecular models and the corresponding interactions is depicted in Figure 4.1.\n\n1 2 3 4\nr?\n\n?1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n5\n\n7\n\nU\n?

The dimer bonds were kept fixed using a SHAKE algorithm [127],\nwith a tolerance factor of 10?5. Since the system can undergo a demixing transition, we\nhave systematically checked that the thermodynamic conditions under consideration were\naway from instability by inspection of the small wave vector behavior of the concentration-\nconcentration structure factor [128,129]. For our mixture this quantity is defined by\n\nScc(Q) = x\n2\nROHSww(Q) + x\n\n2\nwSROH?ROH(Q) ? 2xROHxwSw?ROH(Q), (4.3)\n\nwhere xw and xROH = 1?xw are the mole fractions of water and alcohol respectively. For\nthe partial structure factors, we have approximated SROH?ROH = SRR and Sw?ROH = SwR,\ni.e. we have neglected the contribution of the OH-sites of the dimer. In the study of\ndemixing, this approximation is harmless, since the positions of R and OH sites within the\nsame molecule are obviously tightly bound. The site-site structure factors are numerically\ndetermined from the spatial configurations generated during additional NVT simulation\nruns (in order to keep the box size constant for the binning procedure in Q-space) using\nstandard procedures [129].\n\nThe signature of concentration fluctuations associated with demixing is typically a\nlow-Q diverging concentration-concentration structure factor. By monitoring this quantity\nalong our simulations we have ruled out the presence of inhomogeneities due to demixing.\n\nOur simulations started from a compositionally disordered mixture of ROH and water\nparticles, which was equilibrated at the chosen pressure and temperature for 1\u00d7107 steps\nin the NPT-ensemble. Production runs were 8\u00d7107 step long. The time step was set to\n5 \u00d7 10?6? in reduced units.\n\n4.3 Results\n\nIn what follows we will present our results both for the hetero- and homonuclear ROH\nmodels in a solution of our water-like fluid, first focusing on the ROH influence on the\ntemperature of the maximum density curve of water (which was already determined in\nRef. Si10). We will analyze the influence of the alkyl-group size on the changes of the\nTMD, comparing the results of our heteronuclear and homonuclear models. Finally, we will\nanalyze the behavior of the excess thermodynamics of the mixture just for the heteronuclear\nmodel.\n\n66\n\n\n\n4.3.1 The temperature of maximum density (TMD)\n\nThe density anomaly in water and ROH aqueous solutions can be easily detected repre-\nsenting the temperature dependence of the density along isobars. This can be done studying\na series of state points along various isobars by means of NPT simulations. These results are\npresented in Figure 4.2 for various ROH mole fractions, namely xROH = 0.00, 0.01, . . . , 0.04,\nfirst for our heteronuclear model. Note that the apparent low values of the reduced density\nare due to the fact that densities are scaled with the inner core of the potential. If scaled\nwith the range of the second repulsive range (? 2.5?), which is a more appropriate measure\nof the molecular size, we will have reduced densities in line with what one should expect\nfor a liquid (?? ? 0.5 ? 0.9).\n\nAt a certain concentration of ROH the TMD disappears, since our ROH model lacks a\ndensity anomaly. A relatively accurate numerical estimate of the TMDs was was obtained\nby a polynomial fit to the simulated densities. These points (denoted by solid squares)\nare connected in Figure 4.2 with short-dashed lines, that constitute the TMD curve in the\nT ? ? plane. We observe that the region on the left of the TMD points is characterized\nby the typical density anomaly, namely a density increase upon heating. Note that for all\ncompositions the TMD increases with pressure, to reach and maximum and then decreases.\nThis decrease of the TMD with pressure corresponds to the experimental behavior found in\nwater [130], and is the result of the destructuring effect of pressure on the open structures\n(hydrogen bonded network in the case of water) whose interplay with the high density\nphase gives rise to the density anomaly. The increase of the TMD with pressure at low\npressures is not found experimentally, and it is a consequence of the fact that in our model\nthe TMD curve is placed in the supercritical region. This feature is present even in models\nfor which the TMD curve is in a low density liquid region, such as the ramp fluid [131].\n\nThe various TMD curves for different mole fractions are represented in Figure 4.3.\nOne readily appreciates that the addition of alcohol reduces the density range and the\ntemperature at which the density anomaly is found, ultimately leading to its disappearance.\nPoints at equal pressure are connected by dashed lines.\n\nThe change in the TMD with respect of that of pure water (?TMD(xROH) = TMD(xROH)?\nTMD(xROH = 0)) induced by the presence of solute is represented in 4.4 for various pres-\nsures. For pressures below P? ? 10, and up to a certain concentration, we observe that\nour solute acts as a \u201cstructure-maker\u201d. This means that the presence of solute molecules\nenhances the anomalous behavior of water, by favoring the build up of open structures\nand hence increasing the TMD. At P? = 9.2, the curve presents a maximum around\n\n67\n\n\n\n0.4 0.5 0.6\nT?\n\n5.0\n\n5.4\n\n5.8\n\n6.2\n\n6.6\n\n??\n\n\u00d710?2\n\n(A)\n\n0.4 0.5 0.6\nT?\n\n5.0\n\n5.4\n\n5.8\n\n6.2\n\n6.6\n\n??\n\n\u00d710?2\n\n(B)\n\n0.4 0.5 0.6\nT?\n\n5.0\n\n5.4\n\n5.8\n\n6.2\n\n6.6\n\n??\n\n\u00d710?2\n\n(C)\n\n0.4 0.5 0.6\nT?\n\n5.0\n\n5.4\n\n5.8\n\n6.2\n\n6.6\n\n??\n\n\u00d710?2\n\n(D)\n\nFigure 4.2 Temperature dependence of the density for various solute compositions along isobars\nwith increasing pressure from bottom to top (P? = 2.3, . . . , 27.6). Open circles correspond to\nsimulation data and a dotted line denotes a polynomial fit. (A) xROH = 0.0 (pure water), (B)\nxROH = 0.01, (C) xROH = 0.02 and (D) xROH = 0.03. The TMD is represented by filled symbols,\nwhich are connected with a dashed curve that correspond to a polynomial fit, to represent the\nTMD curve. Pressure increases from bottom to top.\n\nxROH = 0.03 and then decays, which is the qualitative behavior of the TMD tert-butanol\nin water [14]. We find that as pressure increases the change in the TMD is lowered, and\nas a matter of fact for P? > 10, ?TMD(xROH) &lt;0, and the solute behaves as a \u201cstructure-\nbreaker\u201d, reducing the range of anomalous behavior of water. This is accordance with the\nfact that the increase of pressure tends to destroy the low density structures that give rise\nto the density anomaly, therefore the structuring effect of the solute decreases, to finally\nturn the \u201cstructure-maker\u201d into a \u201cstructure-breaker\u201d. For sufficiently high pressures our\nalcohol-like molecules behave like standard solutes which tend to decrease the TMD [14],\ni.e. the effect of the two-scale interaction stemming from the OH site is no longer apparent\n\n68\n\n\n\n0.40 0.44 0.48 0.52\nT?\n\n5.0\n\n5.4\n\n5.8\n\n6.2\n\n6.6\n\n?\n?\n\n( T\nM\nD\n\n)\n\n\u00d710?2\n\np?1\np?2\n\np?3\np?4\n\np?5\np?6\n\np?7\n\np?8\n\np?9\n\nx2 = 0.00\n\nx2 = 0.01\n\nx2 = 0.02\n\nx2 = 0.03\n\nx2 = 0.04\n\nFigure 4.3 Density\nvalues at the tempera-\nture of maximum den-\nsity of the heteronu-\nclear alcohol model, for\nvarious mole fractions,\nxROH = 0.00 (black\nsolid lines and filled cir-\ncles ), xROH = 0.002\n(red dashed and filled\nsquares) and xROH =\n0.003 (green dot-dashed\nline and filled triangles).\nIn all cases the points\nare simulation data, and\nlines correspond to poly-\nnomial fits.

The first effect one can observe is the shift of the TMD\ncurves as a function of solute concentration is minimized with respect to that observed in\nFigure 4.3 for the heteronuclear case. This is a clear indication that the larger the size\nof the apolar tail of the ROH, the more significant the effect of the solute on the TMD.\nThe size dependency of the anomalous behavior is more clearly illustrated in Figure 4.6,\n\n0.40 0.44 0.48 0.52\nT?\n\n5.0\n\n5.4\n\n5.8\n\n6.2\n\n6.6\n\n?\n?\n\n( T\nM\nD\n\n)\n\n\u00d710?2\n\np?1\np?2\n\np?3\np?4\n\np?5\np?6\np?7\n\np?8\n\nhomonuclear model\n\nx2 = 0.00\n\nx2 = 0.01\n\nx2 = 0.02\n\nx2 = 0.03\n\nx2 = 0.04\n\nFigure 4.5 Same\nas Figure 4.3 for the\nhomonuclear alcohol\nmodel\n\nwhere change in the TMD, ?TMD(xROH) for the homonuclear model is represented as a\nfunction of alcohol concentration, xROH for various pressures. Note that the same scale as\nin Figure 4.4 is used. Comparison of both figures shows that the increase in size of the\napolar tail of the alcohol increases the changes in the TMD. On one hand, for pressures\nbelow P? ? 10 the maximum in ?TMD(xROH) (a characteristic of t-butanol and ethanol in\ndilution [14]), practically disappears for the homonuclear model. Interestingly, this model\ndisplays a behavior resembling that of methanol [14], for which the maximum is hardly\nvisible. For this values of the pressure, the \u201cstructure-maker\u201d character of the model alcohol\nis enhanced when the apolar chain is larger. This is in agreement with the experimental\ndata, and with the theoretical predictions of Chatterjee et al. [132] statistical mechanical\nmodel for solutions of apolar solvents in water. Now, as pressure increases above, P? ? 10\nthe solute behaves as a \u201cstructure breaker\u201d, and interestingly, its effect on the TMD is\nalso more significant as the size of the R-site increases, to the point that the drop of the\n\n70\n\n\n\nTMD for the largest concentration considered is three times larger for the heteronuclear\nmodel. Unfortunately, we are not aware of any experimental investigation of the pressure\ndependence of ?TMD(xROH), but since the net effect of pressure is to reduce the range of\nanomalous behavior (in real fluid by breaking the hydrogen bond network, in our model\nby displacing particles towards to first range of the potential), that fact that the effect\nis maximized when the volume of the solute is larger is understandable from a enthalpic\npoint of view.\n\n0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 0.04\nx2\n\n?3\n\n?2\n\n?1\n\n0\n\n?\nT\n?

These are plotted in\nFigures 4.7 for P? = 6.8 and T? = 0.4. One observes that a small number water particles\nmove into the first scale of the potential (more compact structures), but at the same time,\nthe area corresponding to the second repulsive range of the potential (r ? 2?) becomes\nmore populated, which is particularly visible in the evolution of the second maximum of the\ngwOH site-site function. In this way, the addition of solute molecules leads to an increase\nof open structures and more compact ones. The balance between these open and compact\nstructures is correlated with the subtle change from ?TMD > 0 to ?TMD &lt;0 as xROH\ngrows.\n\n71\n\n\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nr?\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\ng\nw\n\nw\n(r\n? )\n\nx2 = 0.00\n\nx2 = 0.01\n\nx2 = 0.02\n\nx2 = 0.03\n\nx2 = 0.04\n\n1.0 1.2 1.4\n\nr?\n\n0.05\n\n0.07\n\n0.09\n\n0.11\n\n0.13\n\n2.9 3.1\n\nr?\n2.1\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\nr?\n\n0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\ng\nw\n\nO\nH\n\n(r\n? )\n\nx2 = 0.01\n\nx2 = 0.02\n\nx2 = 0.03\n\nx2 = 0.04\n\n1.0 1.3 1.6 1.9\n\nr?\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n2.9 3.1\n\nr?\n\n2.0\n\n2.1\n\nFigure 4.7 Water-water (left) and Water-OH (right) radial distribution functions for P? = 6.8\nand T? = 0.4 for various solute concentrations.

For a given quantity, A, the corresponding excess property is defined by\n\nAE(x2,p,T, ) = A(x2,p,T ) ?\n[\nx2A\n\n0\n2(p,T) + (1 ?x2)A01(p,T)\n\n]\n(4.4)\n\nwhere A(x2,p,T ) is the value A in binary mixture of a given composition defined by mole\nfractions (x1,x2). A01 and A\n\n0\n2 are the values of A for the pure components at the same\n\nthermodynamic state. Quantities of interest in binary mixtures are the excess volume V E,\nenthalpy, HE, and specific heat at constant pressure cEP . Excess entropy is also of interest,\nbut it is not directly accessible in MD calculation. Excess volumes, V E, are determined\nfrom the average volume values obtained along NPT simulations for the mixtures and pure\ncomponents. Similarly, excess enthalpy is obtained from the usual expression\n\nHE(x2,p,T ) = U\nE (x2,p,T ) + PV\n\nE (x2,p,T ) , (4.5)\n\nand the excess internal energy, UE, is also directly evaluated from the MD runs for the\nmixture and pure components. The fluctuation of the enthalpy provides a direct path for\n\n72\n\n\n\nthe calculation of the specific heat at constant pressure, cEp ,\n\ncp(x2,p,T ) =\n\n(\n?H(x2,p,T )\n\n?T\n\n)\n\nP\n\n'\n?\n(H (x2,p,T ) ??H (x2,p,T )?)2\n\n?\nNpT\n\n.

(4.7)\n\nThis property requires extremely long simulation runs, and we have assessed the validity of\nour results comparing the results of the fluctuation approach to those obtained by numerical\ndifferentiation of the enthalpy with respect to temperature, for specific points.\n\nOur results for the excess thermodynamics of our mixture system (heteronuclear model)\nare collected in Figure 4.8.

All calculations were done at pressure\nP? = 18.\n\nthe mixture, characteristic of short chain alcohols [19,133,134]. This is in agreement with\n\n73\n\n\n\nthe observed behavior in g(r) (Figure 4.7), in which is seen that water particles move closer\nto each other when solute is incorporated.\n\nThe situation is somewhat different for the excess enthalpy. Here our model ex-\nhibits a minimum for alcohol-rich solutions, in contrast with the experimental situation\nfor methanol [19], ethanol [134] and tert-butanol [133]. In these cases the minimum occurs\nfor water-rich conditions. Moreover, tert-butanol [133] excess enthalpies change sign as the\nconcentration of alcohol increases but, contrary to our model\u2019s behavior, positive values oc-\ncur at high alcohol concentrations. As shown by Gonz\u00e1lez-Salgado and coworkers [19] these\ndiscrepancies could be cured by a simple tuning of the cross interaction parameters. Even\nwith more or less sophisticated models for the pure alcohol and water, excess properties\ncan be even qualitatively wrong when Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules are used [19,134].\n\nFinally, in the lower graph of Figure 4.8 we have the excess constant pressure heat\ncapacity, as obtained from Eq. 4.7. The model performance for the excess heat capacity\nis correlated with that of the excess enthalpy. Again here we observe the presence of\na maximum in agreement with experimental results for methanol [19] and tert-butanol\n[133], but the model predicts its position at somewhat higher concentrations of alcohol.\nNonetheless, we can say that at relatively low temperature the increase of the heat capacity\nreflects the structure-making character of our solvent, in accordance with the experimental\nfindings. Again, discrepancies such as the presence of negative values of the excess heat\ncapacity or the shift of the maxima to regions of higher alcohol concentration can be tuned\nby a careful choice of the cross interaction parameters.\n\n4.4 Conclusions\n\nIn summary, we have presented a detailed computer simulation study of a simple model\nfor diluted alcohol-water mixtures, in which the interactions involving hydrogen bonding\nare represented by a two-scale potential which is known to reproduce a good number of\nwater anomalies. Our results for the dependence of the temperature of maximum density\non the solute concentration, are in qualitative agreement with the experimental behav-\nior of methanol and t-butanol solutions, whose molecules are modeled by a homonuclear\nand heteronuclear dimer respectively. These results indicate that for a small range of\nconcentrations and up to certain values of pressure, these hydrogen-bonding-like solutes\ntend to enhance the open structures of water and hence increase the TMD, behaving as\n\u201cstructure-makers\u201d.\n\n74\n\n\n\nAs pressure increases the \u201cstructure-breaker\u201d character of the solutes is enhanced, being\nlarger as the size of the alkyl group grows. This is understandable as the presence of the\napolar group as pressure increases makes more unfavorable the open structures which are\nresponsible for the anomalous behavior of the model. This enthalpic effect increases with\nthe size of the solute molecule.\n\nFuture work will focus on the dynamic anomalies (e.g. the increase of the diffusion\nconstant with pressure) which are known to be influenced in a similar fashion when diluted\nhydrogen bonded solutes are present, in marked contrast with the effect of other solutes,\neither polar or apolar.\n\nThis work was submitted at Journal Chemical Physics. At this moment this work is\navailable on: arXiv:1701.08670\n\n75\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08670\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nGeneral Conclusions\n\nIn this thesis, we have studied the problems of confinement/disorder and mixtures in\nwater-like models. In the first chapter, we addressed the effect of a porous media on\nthe anomalous properties of a two-dimensional lattice water-like model. We have shown\nthat the coverage of the low-density liquid phase decreases gradually as the increasing of\nthe degree of confinement, and as consequence of the entropic effects, the temperature of\nmaximum density shifts to lower temperatures. For the anomalous behavior, we observe\nthat the TMD is present for all degree of confinement but the anomaly in the diffusion\nremains only to intermediate degrees. Interesting features observed here is the suppression\nof the fluctuations that prevents the estimation of the critical line for the intermediate and\nhigher degree of confinement.\n\nIn relation to the mixtures, we studied the excess properties of the aqueous solution\nthrough a lattice model. Initially, we proposed a variation of the associating lattice gas\n(3D) in order to represent both, solute and solvent. The results for pure components\nwas performed through a detailed study of the different order parameters and showed that\nstructure of the phase diagrams are quite similar, with gas and liquid phases, critical points\nand critical lines. For the study of the mixture, we propose a method to simulate lattice\nmodel at a constant pressure. Using it, we obtained the excess properties at a liquid region\nof solute and solvent. Our model is able to reproduce the excess properties of different\ntypes of solute like, short-chain alcohols and ionic liquids. When the cross interaction\nis attractive, the excess volume and enthalpy are negative, since the \u201cdistance\u201d between\nsolute-solvent are lower than the distance solute-solute/solvent-solvent in bulk. This kind\no behavior is observed in the water-alcohol mixture as, water-methanol and water-ethanol.\nThe inert case, the excess enthalpy is positive while the excess volume is still negative.\n\n76\n\n\n\nFor the case repulsive (hydrophobic) the system show a positive excess volume since the\nmixture has higher density than the pure componentes due to the cross interactions. In\ngeneral lines, we show through a very simple model, with only two free parameters, that\nthe complex behavior of aqueous alcohol solutions can be reproduced.\n\nIn the last chapter, we addressed on the dependence of the temperature of maximum\ndensity with the solute concentration and the excess properties. Our results show that the\nTMD increase at low solute fractions similar observed experimentally for alcohol aqueous\nsolution. The excess volume shows the contraction effect as the introduction of solute.\nThis behavior is evidenced by the radial distribution function. The excess enthalpy of\nour model, diverge of the experimental behavior. The fractions in which the experimental\nexcess enthalpy is positive, our model shows negative values and vice?versa. The specific\nheat shows a maximum similar experimental results for methanol, however, in our model,\nthe fraction of maximum is slightly higher than the experimental results.\n\n77\n\n\n\nChapter 6\n\nPublished articles\n\n1.

Each particle\n(site) carries four arms which point to the four NN sites. In order to compute the residual\nentropy of the lattice model for water we consider two arms of type A (or +1) and two\narms of type B (or -1). A given particle on the lattice can present qW = 4!/(2!2!) = 6\npossible configurations. For the lattice model of solute, we consider two arms of type A,\ntwo of type B and one of type C, which leads to qM = 4!/2! = 12 possible orientations of\nthe particle. We set interactions between NN particles, so that the interaction energy is\nequal to zero for configurations compatible with the ground state of the full model, and\ngreater than zero another case. The pair interactions between NN particles are therefore\nu = 0 when are due to the interactions between pair of arms AB or CB, and u = ? > 0\nfor the other cases (AA, BB, AC, and CC).\n\nThe partition function of the system can be written as:\n\nQ =\n\nqN?\n\ni=1\n\nexp\n\n[\n?U ({S}i)\n\nkBT\n)\n\n]\n(A.1)\n\nwhere N being the number of particles (sites) of the system, U the interaction energy\nand q the number of possible orientations of each particle. {S}i represent the different\nconfigurations of the system. The Helmholtz energy, A, is related with the partition\nfunction through:\n\nA\n\nkBT\n= ? ln Q (A.2)\n\nIn the limit of infinite temperature, all the possible configurations have the same probability\nand we get: A/(kBT) = ?N ln q. We are interested in the limit at low temperature. Given\n\n79\n\n\n\nthe fact that we know the partition function at high temperature, we can make use of\nthermodynamic integration [94,95] to get:\n\nA(T)/(kBT) = ?N ln q +\n? 1/(kBT)\n\n0\n\nU(T ?)d\n\n(\n1\n\nkBT ?\n\n)\n; (A.3)\n\nTaking into account the thermodynamic relation A = U ? TS, S being the entropy, and\ndefining reduced quantities U? = U/?, and T? = kBT/?, we can get:\n\nS(T)\n\nkB\n= N ln q1 +\n\nU?(T)\n\nT?\n?\n? 1/T?\n\n0\n\nU?(T ?)d (1/T ??) . (A.4)\n\nIn the limit of low temperature the potential energy of the model vanishes, and it is also\nfulfilled limT?0(U/T) = 0, therefore we get:\n\nS(T)\n\nkB\n' N ln q ?\n\n? 1/T?\n\n0\n\nU?(T ?)d (1/T ??) ; (T? ? 0) (A.5)\n\nThe residual entropy per particle s0(N) (as a function of the system size) can be computed\nas:\n\ns0(N)\n\nkB\n= ln q ? lim\n\nT??0\n\n? 1/T?\n\n0\n\nU?(N,T ?)\n\nN\nd (1/T ??) (A.6)\n\nThe determination of s0(N) has been carried out using Monte Carlo simulation, in com-\nbination with thermodynamic integration, and parallel tempering techniques. Different\nsystem sizes were considered in order to carry out a finite-size scaling analysis to deter-\nmine s0 in the thermodynamic limit. Parallel tempering facilitates the equilibration of the\nsystems at low temperature, where the systems reach the ground state (except for some\nelementary excitations). For the lattice model for water, we have considered different sys-\ntem sizes: N = 8`3, with ` = 2, 3, 4, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 14. In each case we considered 257 values of\n(1/T?); 1/T?i = i \u00d7 ?(1/T?); i = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , 256; with ?(1/T?) = 0.050. The averaged\nreduced potential energy per particle u? = U/(N?) is 1 for T ??, and it almost vanishes\nfor the lowest values of T considered in the integration u? ? 10?6 (for the largest system\nsizes). It decays rapidly as T ? 0, making possible a reliable cut-off of the integration for\na given level of accuracy in the results. In TABLE A.1 we present the estimates for s0(N).\nIn order to estimate the value of s0 in the thermodynamic limit we have considered the\nscaling relations used by Berg et al. [135],\n\ns0(N)/kB = s0/kB + a1N\n??; (A.7)\n\n80\n\n\n\n` 2 3 4 5 6\ns0(8`\n\n3)/kB 0.435774(13) 0.418939(18) 0.414306(18) 0.412543(16) 0.411693(18)\n` 7 8 9 10 11\n\ns0(8`\n3)/kB 0.411271(19) 0.410988(22) 0.410823(21) 0.410737(24) 0.410645(21)\n` 12 13 14\n\ns0(8`\n3)/kB 0.410619(14) 0.410574(13) 0.410549(8)\n\nTable A.1 System-size dependent estimates for the residual entropy presented as s?0(N)/kB\n\nThe fitting of the simulation results given in TABLE A.1 to Eq. (A.7), with (s0/kB), a1,\nand ? being adjustable parameters leads to:\n\ns\n(W)\n0 /kB = 0.410 41 \u00b1 0.000 02; ? = 0.899 \u00b1 0.005, (A.8)\n\nwhere the label (W) refers to water. Considering the quantities ?(NL) = exp[s0(NL)/kB],\nand fitting the results to\n\n?(N) = ? + a?N\n??, (A.9)\n\nwe get\n? = 1.507 44 \u00b1 0.000 04; ? = 0.905 \u00b1 0.005. (A.10)\n\nThe values of the exponent ? agree within statistical uncertainty with the results of Berg et\nal. [135]. For the residual entropy of the ordinary ice. Interestingly, our estimate of ? for\nour model defined over a system with cubic symmetry and the estimate of for the ordinary\nice of Berg et al. [135]: ?Ice = 1.507 38 \u00b1 0.000 16; ? = 0.923(23), seem to coincide (at\nleast within error bars) in spite of the different structures of the underlying lattices.\n\nIn principle, we could apply the same simulation techniques used for the water in the\ndetermination of the residual entropy of the lattice gas model of the solute. However, the\nvalue of s0 for methanol can be deduced directly from the water results. Given a ground\nstate, the configuration of the water for a system with N molecules (occupied positions)\none can build up 2N directly related ground states for the methanol model, since the\ntwo (undistinguishable) A patches of each particle in the water model corresponds to two\ndistinguishable (A and C) patches in the methanol model. Therefore, we get:\n\ns\n(S)\n0 = s\n\n(W)\n0 + kB ln 2. (A.11)\n\n81\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\n[1] CHAPLIN, M. Water: structure and science. http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water.
