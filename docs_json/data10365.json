With increasing Internet usage, \n\nthere is interest in understanding what services are offered. Enterprise \n\nCourier is a commercial Internet Protocol Private Branch eXchange (IP PBX) \n\nbased on open source Asterisk web-based PBX software for Linux, which \n\nsupports multiple protocols and services, like Interactive Voice Response \n\n(IVR). Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) or CallManager, is a \n\nsoftware based call-processing system (IP PBX) developed by Cisco Systems. \n\nCUCM tracks all active Voice over IP (VoIP) network components; including \n\nphones, gateways, conference bridges, among others. IVR is part of the \n\nAcademic Services costumer contact and ticketing of University of Beira \n\nInterior (UBI). IVR monitoring and analysis are essential for effective \n\noperation and resource management, in particular, multidimensional \n\nanalysis for long-term data is necessary for comprehensive understanding of \n\nthe trend, the quality of customer service and costumer experience. In this \n\npaper, we propose a new IVR analysis model for large volumes of IVR data \n\naccumulated over a long period of time. The IVRCube proposed is an analysis \n\nmodel using online analytical processing (OLAP) on a multidimensional data \n\ncube that provides an easy and fast way to construct a multidimensional IVR \n\nanalysis system for comprehensive and detailed evaluation of long-term \n\ndata. The feasibility and applicability are validated, as the proposed IVRCube \n\nanalysis model is implemented and applied to Academic Services costumer \n\ncontact and ticketing IVR data.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nv \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nResumo  \n\nA Private Branch eXchange (PBX) \u00e9 uma ferramenta indispens\u00e1vel no mundo \n\ndos neg\u00f3cios. As centrais telef\u00f3nicas permitem que os funcion\u00e1rios realizem \n\nchamadas internas entre telefones, ou fa\u00e7am chamadas para a rede externa, \n\ntamb\u00e9m conhecida como Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Com o \n\naumento sistem\u00e1tico da utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da Internet, h\u00e1 um interesse acrescido em \n\nentender quais os servi\u00e7os que s\u00e3o oferecidos nas redes baseadas em Internet \n\nProtocol (IP). Um destes servi\u00e7os \u00e9 o Voice over IP (VoIP). \n\nO Enterprise Courier \u00e9 um software IP PBX comercial para VoIP baseado na \n\naplica\u00e7\u00e3o de c\u00f3digo aberto Asterisk, que opera sobre Linux. O IP PBX \n\nEnterprise Courier suporta v\u00e1rios protocolos e servi\u00e7os, por exemplo o \n\nInteractive Voice Response (IVR). O Cisco Unified Communications Manager \n\n(CUCM) tamb\u00e9m chamado de CallManager, \u00e9 um sistema de processamento \n\nde chamadas IP, ou IP PBX, desenvolvido pela Cisco Systems. O CUCM permite \n\nfazer a gest\u00e3o e opera\u00e7\u00e3o de todos os componentes ativos de voz, incluindo \n\ntelefones, gateways, equipamentos de confer\u00eancia entre outros.  \n\nEstes sistemas coexistem na rede de gest\u00e3o de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es de voz da \n\nUniversidade da Beira Interior (UBI), sendo que o sistema automatizado \n\nutilizado para o encaminhamento de chamadas dos Servi\u00e7os Acad\u00e9micos na \n\nUBI utiliza a tecnologia IVR. Este servi\u00e7o da UBI \u00e9 uma das formas que os \n\nclientes da Universidade (alunos e n\u00e3o alunos) t\u00eam para obter informa\u00e7\u00f5es e \n\nresolver quest\u00f5es de forma r\u00e1pida e simples usando o telefone.  \n\nPor ser um importante ponto de interface entre a universidade e a \n\ncomunidade, a monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o e an\u00e1lise de desempenho do IVR s\u00e3o essenciais \n\npara o funcionamento eficaz e gest\u00e3o de recursos humanos atribu\u00eddos a este \n\nservi\u00e7o, o que torna a tarefa de extrair os dados do sistema de VoIP e \n\napresent\u00e1-los de forma a poder extrair deles informa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00fatil \u00e0 gest\u00e3o, o \n\ncentro deste trabalho de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o. Para a an\u00e1lise dos dados, foi usada \n\numa t\u00e9cnica de an\u00e1lise multidimensional de dados a longo prazo, necess\u00e1ria \n\npara uma compreens\u00e3o abrangente da evolu\u00e7\u00e3o e qualidade de servi\u00e7o \n\nprestada ao cliente tendo como objetivo a melhor experi\u00eancia poss\u00edvel por \n\nparte do cliente.  \n\n\n\nNeste trabalho, propomos um novo modelo de an\u00e1lise de IVR para grandes \n\nvolumes de dados acumulados ao longo de um extenso per\u00edodo de tempo. O \n\nIVRCube \u00e9 um modelo de an\u00e1lise utilizando online analytical processing \n\n(OLAP) num cubo de dados multidimensional que fornece uma forma f\u00e1cil e \n\nr\u00e1pida de construir um sistema de an\u00e1lise multidimensional para avalia\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nexaustiva e pormenorizada dos dados ao longo do tempo. A viabilidade e \n\naplicabilidade deste modelo s\u00e3o validadas, uma vez que o modelo de an\u00e1lise \n\nIVRCube proposto \u00e9 implementado e aplicado ao servi\u00e7o de contacto \n\ntelef\u00f3nico (IVR) dos Servi\u00e7os Acad\u00e9micos da UBI. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nvii \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCall Center, Contact Center, Customer Contact Transformation, Customer \n\nSelf-Service, Customer Service, IVR, IVR Design, Customer Care, Business \n\nIntelligence, OLAP, Multidimensional information systems, Data \n\nWarehousing, Decision Support Systems, Business Analytics, Knowledge \n\nManagement \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nix \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nContents \n\n \n\n \n\nAcknowledgements ...................................................................i \n\nAbstract ............................................................................... iii \n\nResumo ................................................................................ v \n\nKeywords ............................................................................ vii \n\nContents .............................................................................. ix \n\nList of Figures ....................................................................... xi \n\nList of Tables ...................................................................... xiii \n\nAcronyms ............................................................................ xv \n\nExtended Abstract in Portuguese .............................................. xvii \n\n1.

avan\u00e7o da ci\u00eancia. \n\nEste resumo alargado tem a seguinte organiza\u00e7\u00e3o: em primeiro lugar, s\u00e3o \n\napresentados uma pequena introdu\u00e7\u00e3o tecnol\u00f3gica, o problema e objetivo \n\ndesta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o. Seguidamente a solu\u00e7\u00e3o abordada e na sec\u00e7\u00e3o resultados \n\ns\u00e3o apresentados alguns resultados relevantes. A finalizar s\u00e3o descritas as \n\nconclus\u00f5es deste trabalho e propostas linhas de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o para trabalho \n\nfuturo.  \n\n \n\n \n\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o Tecnol\u00f3gica e objetivos \n\n \n\nDurante o ano de 2005 a Universidade da Beira Interior (UBI) iniciou o seu \n\nprocesso de converg\u00eancia da rede telef\u00f3nica e da rede de dados, ap\u00f3s ter \n\nadquirido uma solu\u00e7\u00e3o Internet Protocol Private Branch Exchange (IP PBX) \n\nda Cisco Systems. Esta solu\u00e7\u00e3o foi interligada com o PBX existente e atrav\u00e9s \n\nde um media gateway foi tamb\u00e9m interligado com a rede Public switched \n\n\n\ntelephone network (PSTN). Ap\u00f3s dois anos, em 2007, a UBI integrou um \n\nprojeto \u00e0 escala nacional denominado VOIP@RCTS, que foi liderado pela \n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Computa\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica Nacional (FCCN). Este projeto \n\nconsistiu em interligar todos os PBX existentes atrav\u00e9s de media gateways e \n\nencaminhar o tr\u00e1fego sempre que poss\u00edvel por IP. O software escolhido \u00e9 \n\ndenominado de Enterprise Courier e \u00e9 baseado na plataforma Asterisk. \n\nCom o novo IP PBX Enterprise Courier novas funcionalidades tornaram-se \n\ndispon\u00edveis, nomeadamente a possibilidade de utilizar Interactive Voice \n\nResponse (IVR). Esta funcionalidade permite que as chamadas sejam \n\natendidas automaticamente pelo sistema e ap\u00f3s a sele\u00e7\u00e3o de uma op\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nmenu, a chamada seja encaminhada para um agente ou operador que vai \n\natender o assunto em causa. Esta sele\u00e7\u00e3o permite que o agente que atenda \n\na chamada seja o mais capacitado para o assunto em causa.  \n\n \n\nProblema e motiva\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nA UBI procura melhorar de forma continuada a sua estrutura organizacional, \n\nos seus processos e seus m\u00e9todos de controlo, com o objetivo de satisfazer \n\ne antecipar as necessidades dos seus clientes e outras partes interessadas. \n\nO novo servi\u00e7o IVR do IP PBX Enterprise Courier n\u00e3o tem nenhuma forma de \n\nan\u00e1lise estat\u00edstica dos dados que gera e portanto n\u00e3o existem m\u00e9tricas que \n\npermitam a UBI avaliar e planear melhorias na \u00e1rea do atendimento \n\ntelef\u00f3nico autom\u00e1tico. \n\nEm 2013, o Sr. Vice-Reitor respons\u00e1vel pelos Servi\u00e7os Acad\u00e9micos requereu \n\nque fosse implementada monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o neste sistema para uma correta \n\ngest\u00e3o e supervis\u00e3o do mesmo. Tendo isto em considera\u00e7\u00e3o, este estudo \n\ndescreve a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o levada a cabo que permitir\u00e1 no futuro ter estat\u00edsticas \n\ndo servi\u00e7o IVR e assim contribuir para a tomada de decis\u00f5es de gest\u00e3o melhor \n\ninformadas. \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\nxix \n\n \n\nIVRCube: um modelo de an\u00e1lise IVR usando online \n\nanalytical processing (OLAP) num cubo de dados \n\nmultidimensional \n\n \n\nBaseado num conjunto de entrevistas efetuadas, foi criado um conjunto de \n\nrequisitos funcionais e n\u00e3o funcionais. Estes requisitos foram fundamentais \n\npara o desenvolvimento deste trabalho, pois indicam sob um aspeto geral as \n\nfuncionalidades mais relevantes do sistema. \n\nO sistema Enterprise Courier guarda os registos Call Detail Record (CDR) de \n\ntodas as chamadas, incluindo as chamadas que entram no sistema IVR, em \n\nbase de dados MySQL. A primeira fase do trabalho foi identificar quais os \n\ndados relevantes constantes dos CDR e importar esses dados para o data \n\nwarehouse institucional. Com esses dados foi criada uma estrutura \n\nmultidimensional, normalmente denominada de cubo ou hipercubo, que \n\ncont\u00e9m medidas ou factos e inclui dimens\u00f5es ou perspetivas. O hipercubo \n\nconstru\u00eddo tem seis dimens\u00f5es e duas medidas. \n\n \n\n \n\nResultados e discuss\u00e3o \n\n \n\nOs decisores normalmente pretendem ter acesso \u00e0 informa\u00e7\u00e3o de forma \n\nsimples, generalizada e r\u00e1pida. Nesta se\u00e7\u00e3o s\u00e3o apresentados v\u00e1rios \n\nresultados em forma de gr\u00e1fico e tentou-se de uma forma geral que esses \n\nmesmos resultados fossem expostos a partir das v\u00e1rias perspetivas do \n\nhipercubo constru\u00eddo. \n\nA partir da informa\u00e7\u00e3o recolhida foi poss\u00edvel identificar imediatamente duas \n\nsitua\u00e7\u00f5es no IVR que necessitam ser modificadas: \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n \n\n1.1. Technological background \n\nUniversity of Beira Interior (UBI) [1] started the convergence of the phone \n\nsystem and the data network in 2005, after acquiring a commercial Internet \n\nProtocol (IP) Private Branch Exchange (PBX) software from Cisco called \n\nCallManager [2]. The long term objective to UBI, was to have 100% Voice over \n\nIP (VoIP) network until 2020. The Internet Protocol Private Branch eXchange \n\n(IP PBX) was integrated with the analog PBX\u2019s and with the Public switched \n\ntelephone network (PSTN). Figure 1.1 presents a scheme depicting \n\nCallManager integration in UBI voice architecture. In Figure 1.1, E-carrier \n\n(E1) represents a Primary Rate Interface (PRI). PRI is a standardized \n\ntelecommunications service level within the Integrated Services Digital \n\nNetwork (ISDN). E1 provides 30 communication channels and 2 signaling \n\nchannels, this is also referred to as 30B channels plus 2D channels. In this \n\ncase Media Gateway has 60 voice channels to interconnect VoIP and legacy \n\ntelephony.  \n\nE1\n\nMedia Gateway\nE1\n\nIP PBX Call Manager\n\nE1\n\nPSTN\n\nIP\n\nTrunk\n\nIP Phones\n\nIP\n\nAnalogical Phones\n\n \n\nFigure 1.1 \u2013 Scheme depicting CallManager Integration. \n\n \n\n\n\nIn 2007, Portuguese Universities started changing their phone systems into a \n\nconverged system using the data network to route phone calls. This project, \n\nnamed VoIP@RCTS [3] was launched by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Computa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nCient\u00edfica Nacional (FCCN), the Portuguese National Research and Education \n\nNetwork (NREN). The chosen solution was a software platform based on \n\nFreePBX [4] which uses the Asterisk core [5]. This software, although based \n\non FreePBX, it has been redesigned to suite Universities\u2019 specifications. This \n\nnew software is called Enterprise Courier from itCenter [6]. UBI integrated \n\nthat same project and the system was incorporated in its telephone network. \n\nFigure 1.2 illustrates UBI integration of VoIP@RCTS in the existing \n\ninfrastructure of UBI. In Figure 1.2 we can also see the Session Border \n\nController (SBC) that acts as a firewall for the VoIP world. \n\nTelephony\n\nOperators\n\nE1\n\nSBC\n\nIP\n\nTrunk\n\nIP PBX\n\nEnterprise Courier\n\nIP PBX Call Manager\n\nIP \n\nTrunk\n\nIP\n\nTrunk\n\nIP Trunk\n\nPSTN\n\nBackup\n\nIP\n\nTrunk\n\nIP Phones\n\nIP\n\nAnalogical Phones\n\nMedia Gateway\nE1\n\nE1\n\n \n\nFigure 1.2 \u2013 Integration of VoIP@RCTS in UBI infrastructure. \n\n \n\nAlthough the provided solution was based on open source software, it was \n\ncustomized for the universities specific needs permitting further use of the \n\nnew features offered by Enterprise Courier. One of these possibilities is the \n\nuse of Interactive Voice Response (IVR), which suited some of the specific \n\nservices, allowing for example, the calling user select the most adequate \n\noperator for his/her particular call motivation.  \n\n \n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n \n\n3 \n\n1.2. IVR a new offered service \n\nInteractive Voice Response play an important and increasingly role in today\u2019s \n\nbusiness world and global economy. Indeed, they serve as the primary \n\ncustomer-contact channel, for companies in many different industries. IVR \n\nsystems, if properly designed, can increase customer satisfaction and \n\nloyalty, cut staffing costs and increase revenue by extending business hours \n\nand market reach [7].  \n\nPoorly designed IVR systems, on the other hand, will cause the opposite \n\neffect and lead to dissatisfied customers, increased call volume and even \n\nincreased agent turnover, as customers take out their frustrations on the \n\nagents. A study from Purdue University, revealed that 92% of US consumers \n\nevaluate a company based on their experience using the company's call \n\ncenter. More surprisingly, the study found that 63% of consumers stop using \n\na company's products based on a negative call center experience. That \n\nnumber could raise to 100% for consumers with ages between 18 and 25 years \n\nold [8].  \n\nThere are two options to create an IVR: deep divided design or broad design. \n\nDeep divided design is used in order to limit the number of options in every \n\nmenu, but it can have many submenus. This can increase the complexity and \n\ncreate confusion because it might not fit the user's mental model [9]. \n\nExperimental results showed that users who used broad IVR design performed \n\ntasks faster and with greater satisfaction than users who used deep IVR \n\ndesign [10]. In this study it was preferred a broad design, as it is showed in \n\nFigure 1.3. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 1.3 \u2013 Flowchart for the IVR Academic Services costumer contact and ticketing. \n\n \n\nAccording to Figure 1.3, there are two direct inward dialing (DID), also called \n\ndirect dial-in (DDI) and one internal extension to reach Academic Services \n\nCall to one of the \ndirect dial numbers\n\nCheck time and \nweek day\n\nOut of schedule\n\nPresents a recording with the following options:\n\n0 \u2013 Access to University\n\n1 \u2013 Application and Enrollment\n\n2 \u2013 Certificates and Diplomas\n\n3 \u2013 Tariff and Accreditations\n\n4 \u2013 Equivalence and Recognition of academic degrees\n\n5 \u2013 Other subjects\n\nWorking days from 9h to 13:00h or 14h to 17:45h\n\nTerminate Call\nEnd\n\nChecks the \noption\n\nDial:\n2034\n\nOption 0 Option 1\n\nDial:\n1093\n1095\n1096\n1097\n1105\n1113\n\nOption 2\n\nDial:\n1105\n1109\n1113\n\nOption 3\n\nDial:\n1100\n1101\n\nOption 4\n\nDial:\n1115\n1116\n\nEnd\n\nDirect Dial:\nExt. 1111\n\n275320690\n808200105\n\nDial:\n1113\n\nOption 5\n\nAfter 5 seconds without choosing an option\n\n\n\nIntroduction \n\n \n\n \n\n5 \n\ncostumer contact and ticketing. The date and time are only checked at the \n\nbeginning.  \n\nTo increase customer satisfaction, there were great concerns ordering the \n\nsix menu options. According to the latest studies, the most frequent options \n\nmust be placed in first place [11]. In this way, users calling the service can \n\nidentify their option and don\u2019t have to wait until the recording. This ordering \n\nwas done empirically without previous knowledge and will be discussed later \n\nin the results section. \n\nThere was also a great concern about the recordings. The first challenge had \n\nto do with the tone, pitch and accent. The chosen voice had to transmit a \n\nfeeling of sympathy, had to be sharp and without any accent.  \n\nThe second concern was related to what to present first, the textual \n\ndescription or the option number itself. The goal-action sequence (e.g., \"To \n\ndo x, press y\") was preferred, rather than the action-goal sequence (e.g., \n\n\"Press y to do x\"), for options. Most researchers and standards agree with the \n\ngoal-action sequence because it seems more consistent with the cognitive \n\nmakeup of the task [12]. The goal-action sequence seems to encourage dial-\n\nthrough and was shown slightly faster response times than the action-goal \n\nsequence [13]. \n\nAfter the initial greeting, it\u2019s usual to prompt the user to indicate whether \n\ntouch-tone service is being used. Many IVR systems instruct users to press 1 \n\nas evidence of a Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF). Instead of asking users \n\nto press a key for evidence of DTMF, it\u2019s used the timeout value for key \n\ninsertion. According to Figure 1.3, after five seconds the system will timeout \n\nand automatically choose option 5 [14]. \n\nAfter the option is chosen, the call is inserted in a first-come first-served \n\n(FCFS) queue. The ring strategy used is ring all, i.e., the call that is leaving \n\nthe queue is placed simultaneously in all phones identified for that option, \n\ni.e., a call living option\u2019s 3 queue will dial extensions \u201c1100\u201d and \u201c1101\u201d. \n\nThe first operator to pick up the handset gets the call. \n\n \n\n1.3. Motivation and problem \n\nUBI seeks to continuously improve its organizational structure, its processes \n\nand its control methods, aiming to satisfy and anticipate the requirements \n\nof its customers and other stakeholders.  \n\n\n\nYet, the Enterprise Courier IP PBX does not provide IVR statistics, and \n\ntherefore, there are no metrics that allow UBI to evaluate and plan \n\nimprovements in the area of automated telephone response. \n\nTherefore, in 2013, the Vice-Rector for Academic Affairs, recognized as the \n\nmain stakeholder, required that monitoring and supervision would need to \n\nbe implemented in the Academic Services costumer contact and ticketing \n\nIVR system. \n\nHaving this in consideration, this paper describes the carried out research \n\nthat will allow the future creation of a solution that allows monitoring and \n\nsupervision, for example, get a relationship between how many calls an \n\noption receives and which operator takes it, or how many minutes does a call \n\nlast, or how many seconds is a client on hold until he starts to talk with the \n\noperator, on an Asterisk based software. \n\n \n\n1.4. Organization of the Thesis \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: this paragraph concludes \n\nsection 1, the Introduction, where the problem, motivations and objectives \n\nof the research were outlined; section 2 follows, describing the state of the \n\nart; section 3 presents the architecture and the solution; section 4 describes \n\nand discusses the results obtained; section 5 concludes de the paper \n\npresenting conclusions and future work; and finally in the appendices section \n\na paper with the title \u201cA comprehensive IVR (Interactive Voice Response) \n\nanalysis model using online analytical processing (OLAP) on a \n\nmultidimensional data cube\u201d fruit of this work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nState of the art \n\n \n\n \n\n7 \n\nChapter 2 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. State of the art \n\n2.1. Telephony Evolution \n\nThe first voice transmission was accomplished on 10 March 1876 through a \n\nring down circuit, in which two devices were connected by wire, but there \n\nwas no dialing numbers and it just worked one-way. Inventor Alexander \n\nGraham Bell called out to his assistant Thomas Watson, \u201cMr. Watson, come \n\nhere! I want to see you.\u201d This transmission took place in their attic \n\nlaboratory. Over time, one-way voice transmission transformed to bi-\n\ndirectional voice transmission using wired networks. Before adopting the \n\ncircuit switched technology has the basis of the telecommunication services \n\nthere where human operators making the connections. Until several decades \n\nago, the communication services were based on analog infrastructure, but \n\nthe analog communication is neither robust nor efficient at recovering from \n\nthe line noise (Figure 2.1). In digital communication, the line noise is less of \n\nan issue because digital amplifiers also known as repeaters not only amplify \n\nthe signal, but also clean it to its original condition (Figure 2.1).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1 \u2013 Digital amplification vs Analog amplification. \n\n \n\nOriginal signal\n\nOriginal signal\n\nSignal with noise\n\nSignal with noise\n\nSignal with noise \namplified\n\nSignal amplified\n\nTalker\n\nTalker\n\nAnalog Amplifier\n\nDigital Amplifier\n\nSignal with noise Signal with noise \namplified\n\nSignal with noise Signal amplified\n\n\n\nPublic switched telephone network (PSTN) system sampled the voice stream \n\nat 8 kHz and transmits the digitized voice over the circuit switched network \n\nwith bit rate of 64 kb/s [15]. \n\nAt the end of the 20th century, analog radio, television (TV) and telephony \n\nservices stood out in particular. Most of the audio distribution in home was \n\ncentered in radio, and for this purpose different modulation standards were \n\nused, as is the case of frequency modulation (FM) and amplitude modulation \n\n(AM). Regarding the TV, different signal transmission technologies were \n\nused. One example of this was the use of analog TV broadcasting on the very \n\nhigh frequency (VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) wavebands. After that, \n\nthe satellite broadcasting technology made possible the transmission of \n\naudiovisual content over very long distances, thus encouraging cultural \n\ndiversity and enabling new business models to be set up. Traditionally, \n\ntelephony services have been provided by telecom operators through the \n\nPSTN infrastructure. \n\nHigh-quality voice services had been provided by the traditional PSTN \n\nsystem, since this system was built for switching voice calls over the network. \n\nThe connection between the end points is established before starting the \n\nvoice communications and that connection remains in use until the end of \n\ncommunication. This makes the bandwidth unavailable for the other services \n\nover this established circuit. The architecture built for voice is not flexible \n\nto converge data, video and voice traffic at the same time.  \n\nInterestingly, it was the PSTN that made possible many of the IP data \n\ntransmissions. In the 90s it was common to have a home computer and a \n\ndialup modem connected to the nearest point of presence (POP), as showed \n\nin Figure 2.2.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2 \u2013 Scheme depicting dialup connection to nearest POP.  \n\n \n\nDialer cloud\n\nPSTN\n\nNearest\n\nPoint of Presence (POP)\n\nCommunications Server\n\nDialup modem\n\nDialup modem\n\nPersonal computer\n\nPersonal com puter\n\n\n\nState of the art \n\n \n\n \n\n9 \n\nModern networks are constantly evolving to meet user demands. Initial data \n\nnetworks were limited to exchanging character-based information between \n\nconnected computer systems. Traditional telephone, radio, and television \n\nnetworks were maintained separately from data networks. In the past, every \n\none of these services required a dedicated network, with different \n\ncommunication channels and different technologies to carry a particular \n\ncommunication signal. Each service had its own set of rules and standards to \n\nensure successful communication. \n\nThe Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) transport layer protocols, \n\ntransmission control protocol (TCP) and user datagram protocol (UDP) are \n\nbeing used to overcome the drawbacks. Nowadays, VoIP is one of the \n\nprominent and fastest growing telecommunication service based on an \n\nInternet protocol suite. VoIP enables the users to use the Internet as the \n\ntransmission medium for voice communication. The general architecture of \n\nthe VoIP system presented in Figure 1.2 demonstrates some of the basic \n\nrequirements for implementing a VoIP system. \n\nAdvances in technology are enabling us to consolidate these different kinds \n\nof networks onto one platform referred to as the \u201cconverged network\u201d. \n\nUnlike dedicated networks, converged networks are capable of delivering \n\nvoice, video streams, text, and graphics between many different types of \n\ndevices over the same communication channel and network structure. \n\nPreviously separate and distinct communication forms have converged into a \n\ncommon platform [16]. \n\nIn traditional systems, increasing the connectivity, means more ports to \n\nconnect in telephones which leads to an increase in cost. But in the VoIP \n\nsystem, no extra cost would be paid to increase the connectivity. In VoIP, \n\nincrease in cost relay on the functionality improvement. VoIP is software \n\nbased, so any type of addition can be done just by upgrading the software. \n\nThe hardware cost is also very low because it runs on computer platforms \n\n[17]. \n\nThe VoIP system has a lot of advanced features, which makes the VoIP system \n\nthe best alternative to the traditional circuit network. These features attract \n\nthe communication industries and business community towards the new \n\ntelephony. \n\nLow cost is the main advantage of the VoIP system. The long distance calls \n\ncan be made at very low cost through the VoIP system, since it can access \n\nthe public Internet and the low cost broadband connection, increases the \n\n\n\nadaptation of VoIP system in the small business world, too. It uses the \n\nexisting infrastructure such as computer system and Internet to provide the \n\ncommunication without any addition cabling cost [15].  \n\nData networks are based on packet switching and can be architected to be \n\nreliable and resilient, providing alternative paths to data in case of failure. \n\nVoIP systems benefit from that design and are less susceptible to total \n\nfailure. Because the sound must be digitally encoded to be packetized, the \n\nresulting sound is more robust compared to the traditional analog systems, \n\nas showed in Figure 2.1. Although digitally encoded speech has many \n\nadvantages over its analog counterpart, it nevertheless requires extra \n\nbandwidth for transmission, if it is applied without compression. To \n\ncounteract this, VoIP systems use coder-decoder (codec) through software \n\nand hardware to compress and decompress sound. The selection of a suitable \n\ncodec for the VoIP system is of much importance, since this selection may \n\naffect the system performance. Table 2.1 describes some codecs and various \n\ncharacteristics [18]. \n\n \n\nTable 2.1 \u2013 Comparison of the most well-known voice codecs. \n\nCodec Year Bit rate (kb/s) \nAlgorithmic delay \n\n(ms) \nMean Opinion \nScore (MOS) \n\nG.711 1972 64 0.125 4.1 \n\nGSM-FR 1987 13 20 3.6 \n\nG.722 1988 48, 56, 64 1.5 4.1 \n\nG.726 1990 24 0.125 3.5 \n\nG.726 1990 32 0.125 4.1 \n\nGSM-HR 1994 5.6 24.4 3.5 \n\nG.723.1 1995 6.3 30 3.8 \n\nG.723.1 1995 5.3 30 3.6 \n\nG.729 1996 8 15 3.92 \n\nG.729A 1996 8 15 3.7 \n\nGSM-EFR 1998 12.2 20 4.1 \n\nAMR-NB 1999 4.75 \u2013 12.2 25 3.5 \u2013 4.1 \n\nG.722.1 1999 24, 32 40 4.0 \n\nSpeex (NB) 2002 2.15 \u2013 24.6 30 2.8 \u2013 4.2 \n\niLBC 2004 13.33 40 3.8 \n\niLBC 2004 15.2 25 3.9 \n\nBV32 2005 32 5 4.1 \n\n \n\nThe most obvious way to measure speech quality is to go right to the source \n\nand use human subjects to rate the quality of the telephone calls. This is a \n\n\n\nState of the art \n\n \n\n \n\n11 \n\nsubjective method, described in two ITU recommendations [19] [20]. The \n\nprimary results of the subjective test are mean opinion score (MOS), which \n\nrate the quality of a telephone call from an end-user perspective. The MOS \n\nscore is a subjective score of voice quality as perceived by a large number of \n\npeople listening to speech over a communication system. \n\nTo determine the MOS for a particular phone connection, a statistically valid \n\ngroup of males and females rate the quality of special test sentences read \n\naloud over the connection. This recommendation uses the scale from 1 to 5 \n\nand the MOS of the voice transmission is the average estimate of voice quality \n\nrates assigned by this statistical group as presented in Table 2.2.  \n\n \n\n Table 2.2 \u2013 Subjective speech quality measurement. \n\nSpeech quality MOS \n\nExcellent 5 \nGood 4 \nFair 3 \nPoor 2 \nBad 1 \n\n \n\nAn MOS of 4.0, is considered toll quality (PSTN quality) within the telephone \n\nindustry and anything below MOS of 4.0 would then be below toll quality \n\nlevel. Subjective testing includes both listening opinion and conversation \n\nopinion tests. \n\nDelay is the time taken by the voice to reach from the talker's mouth to the \n\nlistener's ear. Round trip delay is the sum of two one-way delays that occur \n\nin the user's call. In a VoIP system, beside the encoding delay and decoding \n\ndelay, the propagation delay is also affected by three additional delays, \n\npacketing delay, network delay and playback delay. These delays may be \n\nvariable during the transmission [21]. Table 2.3 resumes the general five \n\ncomponents that contribute to the overall delay. \n\n \n\n\n\nTable 2.3 \u2013 Five components that contribute to the mouth-to-ear delay \n\nType of delay Description \n\nEncoding delay \nThe amount of time needed to encode the voice signal, which \ndepends on the voice codec used \n\nPacketization \ndelay \n\nThe amount of time required to packetize the encoded voice stream \n\nNetwork delay The amount of time to transmit the packets to the receiver\u2019s side \n\nDecoding delay The time interval needed to reconstruct the voice signal \n\nPlayback delay \nThe delay induced by the playback buffer that resides at the \nreceiver\u2019s side. This buffer is needed to smooth delay between \nconsecutive packets (jitter) \n\n \n\nOne-way delay, i.e, from mouth-to-ear, should be less than 150 milliseconds, \n\nlatency greater than 400 milliseconds is unacceptable [22]. Table 2.4 \n\ndescribes the delay according to the user's satisfaction. \n\n \n\nTable 2.4 \u2013 Delay limits for one-way transmission. \n\nOne-way delay \nmilliseconds (ms) Description \n\n0-150 Acceptable for most users \n\n150-400 Acceptable but with impact \n\nAbove 400 Unacceptable \n\n \n\nCompared to traditional telephony (circuit switching), VoIP is now more \n\nscalable, robust, reliable, allows the integration of new features and the \n\npossibility of reducing costs. From the perspective of data networks, VoIP \n\nhas transformed the voice into just another application [5].  \n\n \n\n2.2. Unified Communications \n\nVoIP as evolved on the last years and today offers a complete set of tools \n\ncalled unified communications (UC). UC integrates real-time communication \n\nservices such as instant presence information, messaging (chat), desktop \n\nsharing, telephony, video conferencing, data sharing, call control and speech \n\n\n\nState of the art \n\n \n\n \n\n13 \n\nrecognition. UC isn\u2019t necessarily a single product, instead, it\u2019s a set of \n\nproducts that provides a consistent unified user-interface and user-\n\nexperience across multiple devices and media-types. \n\nUC products facilitate the use of multiple enterprise communications \n\nmethods to improve user productivity and to enhance business processes. \n\nThis can include the management, control and integration. UC products \n\nintegrate communications channels, networks and systems, as well as IT \n\nbusiness applications, consumer applications and devices. Offers the ability \n\nto significantly improve how individuals, groups and companies interact and \n\nperform. The UC products may be composed of a single vendor suite, or may \n\nspan multiple platforms and vendors. These products are used by individuals \n\nto facilitate personal communications, and by enterprises to support \n\ncollaborative communications and business workflows. Some products may \n\neven extend UC to the cloud.  \n\n \n\nTable 2.5 \u2013 UC communications areas.  \n\n  \n\nTelephony   This area includes mobile, fixed and soft telephony. \n\nConferencing  \n This area includes videoconferencing, voice conferencing and \nWeb conferencing. Includes application sharing and document \nsharing. \n\nMessaging   This area includes voice mail and email.  \n\nPresence and IM  \n Presence allows individuals to see the status of other people and \nresources. Instant messaging allows individuals or groups to send \nand receive text information in real time.  \n\nClients  \n Unified clients enable access from various platforms from a \nconsistent interface. May include thin browser clients, thick \ndesktop clients, and mobile clients in smartphones and tablets. \n\nCommunications-\nenabled applications  \n\nCommunications-enabled applications include key application in \ncollaboration area. This area includes contact center, \nnotification, and consolidated administration, reporting and \nanalytics tools.  \n\n \n\nMany authors find it useful to divide UC into six broad communication areas, \n\naccording to Table 2.5. \n\n\n\nGartner is the world's leading information technology research and advisory \n\ncompany, delivering the technology-related insight necessary to make the \n\nright decisions.

Asterisk UC will also be included in this study for its \n\npopularity in the open source community.  \n\nAll UC solutions in study allow IVR configuration. IVR allows call handling, in \n\norder to give some sort of response to them without human interaction. Being \n\nthe caller responsible to choose one of the options that are presented. IVR \n\nis usually presented in a form of a menu that can have many layers or \n\nsubmenus and are composed by audio files played to the caller, witch, \n\nthrough touch keys on the phone can interact with the system, for example, \n\nallowing the creation of a voting system via phone, money transfer from a \n\nbank account or to choose the more skilled operator in certain subject [24].  \n\n \n\n\n\nState of the art \n\n \n\n \n\n15 \n\n2.3. Microsoft UC solution \n\nMicrosoft Lync offers UC functionality. Microsoft continues to improve UC \n\nfunctionality with each release and integrates with Active Directory, Office \n\napplications and Skype. Microsoft has a large set of business applications that \n\nwill increasingly be leveraged, including Cortana (a digital assistant) and \n\nOffice Graph (which uses machine learning to define the context and connect \n\nusers with relevant documents, conversations and people). \n\nMicrosoft Lync federation capabilities are an effective way for groups to \n\ncollaborate. Microsoft Lync Online is part of Office 365, however, Lync Online \n\nonly offers a subset of the on-premises solution, with limited PSTN \n\nconnectivity. \n\nAccording to its manufacturer, organizations with a significant number of \n\nemployees that can benefit from Lync's collaboration model, should consider \n\nthe Lync solution. Organizations that use advanced telephony feature \n\nrequirements should also ensure that the needed functions are supported. \n\nAlso according to its manufacturer Microsoft Lync continues to make \n\nsignificant gains in the market and is attractive to a broad range of \n\nenterprises. In many cases, it is initially deployed for its IM, presence and \n\nWeb conferencing functionalities, with gradual incremental deployments of \n\ntelephony and video added as follow-on phased deployments for specifically \n\ntargeted groups or regions. \n\nMicrosoft has added video capabilities. Support for Lync room-based video \n\nsystems and interoperability of standards-based video endpoints were \n\nincluded. \n\nCustomers report that Lync functions can be readily integrated into business \n\nprocesses and applications, providing new, different and effective ways to \n\nperform tasks. Often, these new functions are achieved by deploying Lync \n\nenhancements from a growing list of ecosystem partners. \n\nLync implementation might not eliminate legacy PBXs. Usually, Lync Web \n\nconferencing and IM/presence are deployed across the organization, while \n\ntelephony is deployed only for a subset of employees. Telephony \n\nimplementation will include third party\u2019s software and hardware. Deploying \n\nLync might be a challenge, multiple partners may be required to obtain a \n\ncomplete deployment, for example, different partners for telephones, \n\ngateways, servers, remote support and network monitoring. This can lead to \n\nincompatibilities on software from any of these partners.  \n\n\n\nAccording to the documentation it\u2019s possible to do IVR reporting. \n\nDocumentation indicates the need to export the data and then run the \n\nanalyses using PowerShell. A PowerShell example would be [25]:  \n\n$calls = Import-Csv -Path \n\n\"C:\\Response_Group_Call_List_Report_export.csv\" \n\n$calls | Group-Object Workflow | Select-Object Count, Name \n\n| Sort-Object Count \u2013Descending \n\nThe resulting information would be similar to Figure 2.4 [25]. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.4 \u2013 Example of IVR Lync reporting using PowerShell.  \n\n \n\n2.4. Cisco UC solution \n\nCisco offers a full UC suite, and as part of it a broad range of communications \n\nfunctions. Key parts of the UC suite include Cisco Jabber, CUCM, Cisco Unity \n\nConnection and Cisco WebEx. The entire portfolio is available on VMware, \n\noperating on Cisco Unified Computing System (CUCS) servers or other \n\nqualified servers. Cisco leverages its UC software into a cloud portfolio \n\nbranded Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solution (Cisco HCS), which allows to \n\nbuild Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) or hybrid options on \n\npremises. \n\nAccording to the vendor, Cisco UC has strong voice and video capabilities and \n\nsolutions from midsize to multinational sites. It\u2019s very attractive for \n\nenterprises that wish to leverage Cisco's networking infrastructure or that \n\nrequire full UC client integration on leading mobile platforms. A full UC suite \n\nis offered with IM/presence, video, multiple conferencing options and \n\ntelephony, also available on leading mobile platforms. \n\nThrough Internet service providers (ISP), Cisco is advancing hybrid on-\n\npremises and cloud options. Cisco HCS is based on the on-premises software \n\nand both support the same Jabber client, there are also the possibility to \n\ntransfer licenses from on-premises to hosted environments. \n\n\n\nState of the art \n\n \n\n \n\n17 \n\nCisco UC solution is based on a set of distinct products and acquisitions over \n\nthe years, as a result some administrator and user experiences are \n\nfragmented. \n\nIVR possibility comes in two flavors Unified Contact Center Express, for small \n\nimplementations and Unified Contact Center Enterprise for larger \n\ndeployments [2]. \n\nThe ability to create IVR reports is given by one add-on tool called Cisco \n\nUnified IP IVR. This tool can create reports for application performance \n\nanalysis report, detailed call by call report and traffic analysis report for \n\nanswered and unanswered calls [2].  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 \u2013 Report generation for abandoned calls.  \n\n \n\nFigure 2.5 show\u2019s how to create a report for Cisco Contact Center Express. \n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility to schedule reports and load existing reports. For \n\nEnterprise version the Unified Intelligence Center is a more complete tool. \n\nIt\u2019s possible to create Dashboards, and reporting is more flexible. Figure 2.6 \n\nshow\u2019s a simple example. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2.6 \u2013 Report generation using Unified Intelligence Center. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 2.6 the report was manipulated by the administrator just to show \n\nhandled calls, abandoned calls and service level for the analyzed period. \n\nReports still have to pass through a configuration menu indicating start and \n\nend date, similar to Figure 2.5. For advanced users there\u2019s also the possibility \n\nto run SQL queries. \n\n \n\n2.5. Avaya UC solution \n\nAvaya is one of the leaders in Gartner review and has a wide set of \n\ncommunications products. The UC product is Avaya Aura Platform. Other \n\nelements in the UC portfolio are: Avaya Aura Conferencing, Avaya Aura \n\nMessaging, Scopia Video Conferencing and the Avaya Aura Collaboration \n\nEnvironment. There are also available UC applications for desktop, mobile, \n\nphone and video. Avaya Aura is considered a good solution in the presence \n\nof heterogeneous environments (systems, services and devices). The vendor's \n\nstrength and brand recognition in telephony and contact center are central \n\nkey elements for Avaya's products. The UC solution is advancing to the cloud \n\nand is based on the same solution as the on-premises version.  \n\nAvaya is expanding its portfolio in Avaya Aura Collaboration, expanding \n\nmiddleware integration options there for enabling a broader ecosystem of \n\npartner applications. The expansion on the integration capabilities, allows a \n\nstronger multivendor UC integration, for example, integration with Microsoft \n\nLync. The multivendor integration and the portfolio redundant capabilities \n\n(Scopia, Aura Conferencing and Avaya one-X Communicator) might lead to \n\nclient confusion in the sales process and the Avaya solutions themselves \n\nappears individual point solutions, rather than as a comprehensive UC suite.  \n\n\n\nState of the art \n\n \n\n \n\n19 \n\nAvaya's contact center solutions are: Aura Contact Center and Aura Call \n\nCenter Elite, both capable of IVR. Reports are also available in this solution \n\nbut have to pass through a few configuration menus indicating the kind of \n\nreport and the span date.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.7 \u2013 Report example on agent performance. \n\n \n\n2.6. Mitel UC solution \n\nIn 2013, Mitel changed its offerings, simplifying the buy experience. In the \n\nend of 2013 Mitel and Aastra entered in a merge process. The deal was closed \n\nin January 2014 and gave birth to a new company under the name of Mitel, \n\nwhile continuing to leverage Aastra\u2019s strong brand recognition in European \n\nmarkets. Aastra had a strong portfolio for telephony, video, call centers and \n\nUC. Mitel pretends to use MiCollab suite as the common UC solution across \n\nthe various call management platforms. MiCloud service is also available as \n\nUCaaS based on MiCollab, MiVoice and MiContact Center. The incorporation \n\nof Aastra video capabilities into the existing MiCollab video option and into \n\nMiVoice Video Unit are on track. One big concern about Mitel and their \n\nproducts is that the expanded portfolio may reduce Mitel ability to research, \n\ndevelopment and support. \n\nThe Mitel MiVoice, MiCollab and MiContact Center solutions provide a mature \n\nand comprehensive software suite. The common based software architecture \n\nmakes it possible to use a distributed solution or centralized solution in a \n\ndata center. They run on industry-standard servers, and are certified for \n\nvirtualizations on VMware environments. The same solutions are also \n\navailable as cloud offerings.  \n\n\n\nMitel MiContact Center sits on top of MiVoice product and has two versions, \n\nBusiness Edition delivers robust contact center, IVR, multimedia \n\nfunctionality and reporting but packaged specifically for small contact \n\ncenters. For large scale Mitel MiContact Center Enterprise Edition is a robust, \n\nhighly flexible solution that delivers feature-rich IVR capabilities, contact \n\ncenter monitoring and reporting. Reporting can be made by request or by \n\nschedule. It\u2019s very similar to other vendors solutions, in this case the result \n\nis an excel file that can be later worked by a statistician or imported to data \n\nwarehouse for data mining. Mitel also allows access to its database raw data, \n\nfor custom reports. \n\n \n\n2.7. Asterisk UC solution \n\nAsterisk system is built by a community of developers and is targeted to \n\ncommunication systems developers. The result is an engine that is able to \n\nhandle the low-level details of initiating, maintaining and manipulating calls \n\nbetween endpoints (phone terminals). Since the initial release it\u2019s been \n\ntested and refined by a community of more than 80,000 developers. With the \n\nright developer skills, raw configuration files and custom scripts, it\u2019s possible \n\nto provide UC capabilities like: voice messaging, instant messaging, desktop \n\nfax, drag/drop call control, multi-party conferencing and IVR [5]. \n\nThere are many forks from Asterisk, some are free to use and usually have \n\nno support, like: FreePBX or Trixbox CE, while others, are commercial \n\nversions and typically provide software, hardware and support for both. \n\nSome commercial versions of Asterisk are: Switchvox, Masip, Zycoo, \n\nEnterprise Courier and Xorcom, among many others. \n\nAsterisk includes a wealth of functions that make it a powerful IVR platform: \n\naudio playback, audio recording, queues and calendar integration. For \n\nAsterisk, IVR is just a special use of the Dialplan, as showed in Figure 2.8 \n\n[26]. \n\n\n\nState of the art \n\n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8 \u2013 Asterisk IVR Hello World, using Dialplan language. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.8, shows how the Dialplan can be used to create IVR function in \n\nAsterisk. In this example, if someone dials the extension 90, the system will \n\npick up the call and will play the audio file called \n\nhello_world_audio_file. Meanwhile if the key 1 is pressed the system \n\nwill play the audio file called you_pressed_1_audio_file and \n\nafterwards the system will hang-up the call. A similar action will occur if key \n\nnumber 2 is pressed.  \n\nIVR are just calls and being so, one could think about using Call Detail Record \n\n(CDR) for reporting. \n\nIn Asterisk based systems, CDR-stats [27] is a separate application that \n\nanalyses the CDR and creates statistics from there. There are two options: \n\nprofessional support (commercial version) or community support (free to \n\nuse). It\u2019s one interesting tool for CDR reporting, but it\u2019s not by any mean IVR \n\nspecialized, the report will have inconsistent results. Being IVR just a special \n\nuse of the Dialplan, creates a few difficulties for IVR reporting, because \n\ngenerally calls that enter IVR will generate more than one CDR record.  \n\nQueueMetrics is a call center analysis, monitoring and reporting software \n\napplication for Asterisk. Because it is specialized for call centers it has a \n\nspecial treatment for IVR. QueueMetrics can be integrated with some \n\nAsterisk based systems and it\u2019s a commercial solution with a license renewal \n\nevery four years. This software creates reports for total calls, answered calls, \n\nunanswered calls, Call distribution, Agents and Call detail, as showed in \n\nFigure 2.9 [28]. \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 \u2013 Scheme depicting QueueMetrics Answered call distribution per hour. \n\n \n\nFigure 2.9 shows peak hours of IVR use, in this example, peak hours are \n\nbetween 17:00 and 22:00, this can be very useful for assigning more \n\nworkforce at this hours.  \n\n \n\n2.8. Call Center Management and Reporting  \n\nCall Center or Contact Center equipment currently available generates vast \n\namounts of data related to the daily operation of a call center. This data is \n\nused by the UC equipment to route calls and logging, but also has the \n\npotential to reveal important details about agent's productivity and \n\nperformance. This data can reveal user experience provided by the contact \n\ncenter to each person that placed a call in the system. To date there has \n\nbeen no public system or method which has been able to gather, organize, \n\ninterpret, and report vital data to managers and supervisors in a manner \n\nwhich unleashes the full potential and value of such data [29]. \n\n\n\nArchitecture and solution to the problem \n\n \n\n \n\n23 \n\nChapter 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3. Architecture and solution to the problem: a \n\ncomprehensive IVR analysis model using online \n\nanalytical processing on a multidimensional data cube \n\n \n\n3.1. Requirements \n\nAs presented in the introduction section, there was a need to develop new \n\nsolutions for a system analysis approach in order to respond to the UBI\u2019s 2020 \n\nmission call for constant improvement on all University services. \n\nThe relevant stakeholders were, primarily, the Vice-Rector for the Academic \n\nAffairs, and also, too much lesser extent, the users at the Academic Services, \n\nand external users that contact UBI using the telephone. \n\nBased on the interviews conducted with the stakeholders, the following list \n\nof functional requirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR) was \n\nproduced for the answered and unanswered calls: \n\nFR1: The system must be able to provide metrics on the efficiency of \n\nthe incoming calls, e.g., the system must provide information about \n\nthe answered and unanswered calls per day or set of consecutive days, \n\nmonth or set of consecutive months, quarter or set of consecutive \n\nquarters and year or set of consecutive years;  \n\nFR2: The system must be able to provide information about the \n\nanswered calls per operator number;  \n\nFR3: The system must be able to provide information about the \n\ndistribution of the incoming calls, i.e. the system must provide \n\ninformation about the answered and/or unanswered calls per IVR \n\nmenu option; \n\n\n\nFR4: The system must be able to provide information about the time \n\nspent, i.e. the system must provide information about the waiting \n\ntime and conversation time. \n\nNRF1: The system must not install any software in the IP PBX \n\nEnterprise Courier. \n\nNRF2: The system must not interfere with the IP PBX system, e.g. the \n\nsystem must not alter the IP PBX databases. \n\nNRF3: The system must not interfere with the VoIP performance. \n\nIt must be noted that this list of requirements is not final, as the approach \n\nto the development of the system was performed in a prototyping manner, \n\nthus allowing the stakeholders to refine the requirements list, i.e., the \n\nresults that the system must output will be subject of continuous \n\nimprovement. \n\n \n\n3.2. Call Detail Record structure \n\nThe IP PBX Enterprise Courier stores locally, in a MySQL database, \n\ninformation about all calls in a format named Call Detail Record (CDR) and \n\nin particular, calls that enters into the IVR. The CDR structure has the \n\nfollowing fields: cdr_id, calldate, clid, src, dst, dcontext, \n\nchannel, dstchannel, lastapp, lastdata, duration, billsec, \n\ndisposition, amaflags, accountcode, uniqueid and \n\nuserfield.  \n\n \n\n3.3. Retrieved fields to Data WareHouse \n\nFrom all of the fields, there are a few with special interest for this study: \n\ncdr_id, calldate, src, dst, duration, billsec, disposition and \n\nuniqueid.  \n\nThe cdr_id field is a sequential number generated when the database \n\nrecord is created.  \n\nThe calldate field has the timestamp for the call beginning and is a \n\ndatetime type.  \n\n\n\nArchitecture and solution to the problem \n\n \n\n \n\n25 \n\nThe src field has the call source, e.g. \u201c+351275319700\u201d and is of varchar \n\ntype.  \n\nThe dst field has the call destination, e.g. \u201c1113\u201d and is a varchar type.  \n\nThe duration field has the call total time in seconds and it is of int type.  \n\nThe billsec field has the call conversation time in seconds and it is of int \n\ntype. \n\nThe disposition field is a varchar type and can take two possible strings: \n\n\u201cANSWERED\u201d or \u201cUNANSWERED\u201d.  \n\nThe uniqueid field has the id for the call in question and is a varchar type.  \n\nThe relevant data fields [30] for this study are retrieved from Enterprise \n\nCourier IP PBX by the data warehouse and are stored for comprehensive and \n\ndetailed analysis as it is showed in Figure 3.1. The data warehouse retrieval \n\nSQL job, fetches new data, based on CDR_id, i.e, twice a day and it can be \n\nadjusted for more sensitive real-time data, if required.  \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1 \u2013 Data retrieval scheme. \n\n \n\nAs stated before in Chapter 2, usually there are two database rows for the \n\nsame call. Actually, this only occurs if the call is answered. The first CDR is \n\ngenerated for the receiving call stating the queue of the call. This queue can \n\nthen be translated to the appropriate IVR option. The second CDR record is \n\ngenerated for the operator that took the call, as showed in Table 3.1. \n\n \n\n\n\nTable 3.1 \u2013 Records representing one answered call. \n\ncdr_id calldate src dst duration billsec disposition \n\n2448554 \n\n2014- \n\n07-15 \n\n15:57:01 \n\n91XXX6962 9000005 223 223 ANSWERED \n\n       \n\n2448239 \n\n2014- \n\n07-15 \n\n15:57:34 \n\n91XXX6962 1113 192 188 ANSWERED \n\n \n\nIn Table 3.1 it was omitted the field uniqueid, the value is \u201casterisk-\n\n1405436252.64896\u201d for both records. \n\nThe total call length, since the system pick up the call, until the operator or \n\nuser ended the call, is given by the first record in the duration field, in \n\nthis case 223 seconds. \n\nTotal conversation time is given by the second record, in the field billsec, \n\nthat in this example is 188 seconds.  \n\nThe waiting time for answered calls is defined in this study as showed in \n\nEquation 3.1 and Equation 3.2. \n\n \n\n????_???? = ?????_????_????? ? ????????????_????. (3.1) \n\n \n\nSubstituting with the values of Table 3.1, the result will be: \n\n \n\n????_???? =  223 ? 188 = 34 ???????. (3.2) \n\n \n\nThe destination field (dst), in the first record with the value \u201c9000005\u201d \n\nrepresents the queue that took the call. This value can be translated to IVR \n\noption number \u201c5\u201d, and according to Figure 1.3, represents \u201cOther issues\u201d. \n\nThe destination field (dst), in the second record with the value \u201c1113\u201d \n\nrepresents the actual phone extension that took this call. \n\n\n\nArchitecture and solution to the problem \n\n \n\n \n\n27 \n\nThe source field (src), in both records was partially omitted for privacy \n\nreasons. \n\n \n\nTable 3.2 \u2013 Record representing one unanswered call. \n\ncdr_id calldate src dst duration billsec disposition \n\n1847989 \n\n2014- \n\n04-22  \n\n15:13:37 \n\n24XXX5728 9000005 173 173 ANSWERED \n\n \n\nUnanswered calls only generate one record, like it\u2019s showed in Table 3.2. \n\nThe disposition field shows the value \u201cANSWERED\u201d because the system \n\npicked up the call and presented the IVR menu options to the user. The \n\nsecond record doesn\u2019t exist because the operator didn\u2019t took this call.  \n\nThe duration field represents the total time of this call. This value is \n\ndefined for this study, as the waiting time, that in this case was 173 seconds, \n\napproximately 2 minutes and 53 seconds. \n\nThe destination field (dst), with the value \u201c9000005\u201d represents the queue \n\nthat took the call. This value can be translated to IVR option number \u201c5\u201d, \n\nand according to Figure 1.3, represents \u201cOther issues\u201d. \n\nIn Table 3.2 it was omitted the field uniqueid, the value is \u201casterisk-\n\n1398176017.17671\u201d and in the case of unanswered calls, this value is in \n\nfact unique. \n\n \n\n3.4. Cube Structure \n\nOnline Analytical Processing (OLAP) is a technology that is used to organize \n\nlarge business databases and support business intelligence. OLAP databases \n\nare constituted by cubes. \n\nOnline Analytical Processing (OLAP) databases facilitate business intelligence \n\nqueries. OLAP is a database technology that has been optimized for querying \n\nand reporting, instead of processing transactions. \n\nOLAP data results from historical data and is aggregated into structures that \n\npermit sophisticated analysis. OLAP data is also organized hierarchically and \n\n\n\nstored in cubes instead of tables. It is a sophisticated technology that uses \n\nmultidimensional structures to provide rapid analysis. \n\nWith the imported data, a multidimensional data model is constructed at the \n\ninstitutional data warehouse. This model views data in the form of a data \n\ncube [31] [32] [33]. A data cube allows data to be modeled, viewed and \n\nfiltered in multiple dimensions.  \n\nCube is a data structure that aggregates measures by the levels and \n\nhierarchies of each of the dimensions that are needed to analyze. Cubes \n\ncombine several dimensions, such as time, geography, and product lines, \n\nwith summarized data. Cubes are not \"cubes\" in the strictly mathematical \n\nsense, however, they are an appropriate representation for the concept. \n\nThe cube is defined by dimensions and facts [34]. Dimension tables are \n\nintegral companions to a fact table. Dimensions are a set of one or more \n\norganized hierarchies of levels in a cube that a user understands and uses as \n\nthe base for data analysis. The dimension tables contain the textual \n\ndescriptors. Each dimension is defined by its single primary key, designated \n\nby the PK notation in Figure 3.2, which serves as the basis for referential \n\nintegrity with any given fact table to which it is joined. Dimension table \n\nattributes play a vital role in the data warehouse, since they are the source \n\nof virtually all interesting constraints [35].  \n\n \n\n\n\nArchitecture and solution to the problem \n\n \n\n \n\n29 \n\n \n\nFigure 3.2 \u2013 Cube structure view. \n\n \n\nA fact table is the primary table in a dimensional model [34]. The fact table \n\ncontains the names of the facts, or measures, according to Figure 3.2, \n\n\u201cwait_time\u201d and \u201cconversation_time\u201d. Measures are the central \n\nvalues in the cube that are processed, aggregated and analyzed. \n\nIn addition to these measures, calculated measures were introduced based \n\non this two primary measures, MAX_wait_time as the maximum value for \n\nwait_time, MIN_wait_time as the minimum value for wait_time, \n\nAvg_wait_time as the average value for wait_time, \n\nMAX_conversation_time as the maximum value for \n\nconversation_time, MIN_conversation_time as the minimum value \n\nfor conversation_time and Avg_conversation_time as the average \n\nIVR_HIT_ Academics\n\nid_callPK\n\nwait_ti me\n\nconversation_ti me\n\nTi meKeyFK\n\nPK_DateFK\n\nid_IVRFK\n\nid_SRCFK\n\nid_DSTFK\n\nDIM_IVR_OPTION\n\nid_IVRPK\n\noption\n\nDescription\n\nDIM_SRC\n\nid_SRCPK\n\nnumber\n\nDIM_DST\n\nid_DSTPK\n\nnumber\n\nDIM_CALENDAR\n\nPK_DatePK\n\nYear\n\nMonth\n\nDIM_TIME\n\nTi meKeyPK\n\nHourlyBucket\n\nDay\n\nDIM_ANSWERED\n\nid_ANSWEREDPK\n\nDescription\n\nid_ANSWEREDFK\n\n\n\nvalue for conversation_time were introduced, as well foreign keys to \n\neach related dimension tables, designated by the FK notation in Figure 3.2.  \n\nThe fact table itself generally has its own primary key made up of a subset \n\nof the foreign keys. This key is often called a composite or concatenated key, \n\nin Figure 3.2 is showed as id_call.  \n\nA data warehouse requires a concise, subject-oriented schema that \n\nfacilitates online data analysis. A star schema [32] for the multidimensional \n\nanalysis model, Figure 3.2, with the fact table in the middle. As this schema \n\nwas applied on IVR data, it was decided to call it IVRCube. \n\nFor the multidimensional analysis model were defined six dimensions [36]: \n\nDIM_CALENDAR, DIM_TIME, DIM_DST (stands for destination), DIM_SRC \n\n(stands for source), DIM_ANSWERED and DIM_IVR_OPTION.  \n\nThe DIM_DST dimension has all possible destination numbers, in this study, \n\nit\u2019s the operator numbers. DIM_SRC dimension has all source numbers from \n\nthe data source. DIM_SRC and DIM_DST dimensions has all sources and \n\ndestinations respectively, from the data source and are populated from the \n\nretrieved data (Figure 3.1).   \n\nDIM_CALENDAR dimension is the one dimension nearly guaranteed to be in \n\nevery data mart, because virtually every data mart is a time series. Calendar \n\ndimension was created with an SQL script and has all possible data from 2014 \n\nuntil 2020.  \n\nDIM_TIME dimension gives a perspective of how hours of the day may \n\ninfluence the service (for example peak hours). TIME dimension was created \n\nwith an SQL script and has all possible hours from 00h until 23 hours 59 \n\nminutes 59 seconds, distributed in hourly bucket.  \n\nThe DIM_ANSWERED dimension takes just two possible values, according to \n\nTable 3.1 it will take the \u201cANSWERED\u201d value or according to Table 3.2 it will \n\ntake the \u201cUNANSWERED\u201d value, i.e., the value in DIM_ANSWERED dimension \n\nis manipulated to represent answered or unanswered calls. \n\nThe DIM_IVR_OPTION dimension has all possible options the clients can \n\nchoose from the IVR menu. This was the only dimension that was manually \n\npopulated with the names of the possible options of the IVR menu, according \n\nto Figure 1.3, \u201cAccess to University\u201d, \u201cApplication and Enrollment\u201d, \n\n\u201cCertificates and Diplomas\u201d, \u201cTariff and Accreditations\u201d, \u201cEquivalence and \n\nRecognition of academic degrees\u201d and \u201cOther issues\u201d.  \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n31 \n\nChapter 4 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4. Results and Discussion \n\nHigh level decisions often want to see a big picture indicating broader trends \n\nbased on aggregated data, or to see these trends broken down by any number \n\nof variables. Business intelligence is the process of extracting data from an \n\nOLAP database and then analyzing that data for information that can be used \n\nto make informed business decisions. \n\nThe IVR in study is running since late January of 2014 and the presented \n\nresults include processed information since then until September 5, 2014. \n\nOLAP data was retrieved using Microsoft Excel. Results may be presented in \n\ntable form, or as charts. In this section, some of the most relevant views \n\nfrom the multidimensional analysis are presented.  \n\nAccording to Figure 4.1 the three most used IVR options are: \u201cApplication \n\nand Enrollment\u201d, followed by \u201cCertificates and Diplomas\u201d and \u201cAccess to \n\nUniversity\u201d. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1 \u2013 Total Calls (Answered and Unanswered) distribution by IVR option. \n\n \n\n\n\nAs stated before, there were great concerns ordering the six menu options. \n\nAs data showing suggests in Figure 4.1, a change in IVR menu order should \n\ntake place in a near future, as proposed in Table 4.1.  \n\n \n\nTable 4.1 \u2013 Proposed reorder of IVR menu options. \n\nNew IVR menu position \nIVR menu Option \nDescription Older Position \n\n1st Application and Enrollment 2nd \n\n2nd Certificates and Diplomas 3rd \n\n3rd Access to University 1st \n\n4th Tariff and Accreditations 4th \n\n5th \nEquivalence and \nRecognition of academic \ndegrees \n\n5th \n\n6th Other issues 6th \n\n \n\nThe three first options are actually the options with more hits. The empirical \n\nreasons behind the ordering were reasonable, since shifting option \u201cAccess \n\nto University\u201d to third place matched the correct IVR menu order.  \n\nOptions in fourth, fifth and sixth positions maintain the same positions as the \n\noriginals. \u201cOther issues\u201d option should maintain the last option, because it\u2019s \n\na last resort option. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n33 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.2 \u2013 Total (Answered and Unanswered) calls distribution by month. \n\n \n\nIn the monthly distribution, January had a very small number of calls, most \n\nlikely because it was when the IVR service was created and it wasn\u2019t properly \n\nadvertised. Calls volume triples in July and August compared to previous \n\nmonths. Data available for September only includes the first week, according \n\nto Figure 4.2 it\u2019s expectable that September total calls will exceed August \n\ntotal calls.  \n\nIn Figure 4.3, additional detail shows the evolution on the motivation for the \n\ncalls in the months of July, August and September and compares it to calls \n\nin the month of June.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.3 \u2013 Total Calls distribution by IVR option and by month. \n\n \n\nThe month of July, relative to June (Figure 4.3) shows a global increase in \n\nall IVR options. In particular the options: \u201cCertificates and Diplomas\u201d, \n\n\u201cAccess to University\u201d and \u201cApplication and Enrollment\u201d.  \n\nJuly is the end of the scholar year, and recent graduated students need their \n\ncertificates and diplomas to compete in the labor market, explaining the \n\nabnormal amount of calls related to \u201cCertificates and Diplomas\u201d.    \n\nIn Portugal, from July 17 until August 8 and from September 8 until \n\nSeptember 12, are periods of the year where students choose which \n\nUniversity they want to enroll. From September 6 until September 10 is the \n\nfirst period for new students to enroll in their courses. Both of these two \n\nsituations explain the call increase in options \u201cAccess to University\u201d and \n\n\u201cApplications and Enrollment\u201d for the months of July, August and \n\nSeptember. \n\nFigure 4.4 presents call distribution by operator. Extension 1113 answerers \n\nmost of the calls 52% and, according to Figure 1.3, this is perfectly \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n35 \n\nacceptable since this operator responds to three options of IVR menu, as \n\nshowed in Figure 1.3.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.4 \u2013 Calls distribution by operator extension. \n\n \n\nWith exception for extension 1113, extensions 2034 and 1105 together have \n\n1572 calls, representing more calls than all other extensions combined (1058 \n\ncalls).  \n\nExtension 1107 is not referred before in Figure 1.3, as this is a very recent \n\nchange to Figure 1.3 \u2013 Flowchart for the IVR Academic Services costumer \n\ncontact and ticketing. It\u2019s yet uncertain if this change is to persist or not, \n\nbut it\u2019s reflected automatically in this study. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.5 \u2013 Calls distribution by answered and unanswered type. \n\n \n\nOne major concern is how many calls are being answered and how many calls \n\nare being lost, as this might indicate the performance of the entire IVR \n\nservice. Figure 4.5 indicates the distribution of calls by answered and \n\nunanswered type. From a total of 7261 calls, 24.6% are unanswered, also \n\ninteresting is how answered and unanswered calls are distributed per IVR \n\noption (Figure 4.6).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.6 \u2013 Answered and unanswered calls distributed by IVR option. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n37 \n\nFigure 4.6 indicates the number of unanswered calls per IVR option, \n\nindicating exactly 206 and 835 unanswered calls in options \u201cAccess to \n\nUniversity\u201d and \u201cApplication and Enrollment\u201d, respectively. These two \n\noptions combined represent the possible interest of students to become UBI \n\nalumni, and have a total of 1041 unanswered calls.  \n\nOption \u201cEquivalence and Recognition of academic degrees\u201d has the lowest \n\nnumber of unanswered calls. This doesn\u2019t mean that it has the best rate of \n\nanswered calls, as it\u2019s possible to confirm in Figure 4.7. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.7 \u2013 Answered and unanswered calls distributed by IVR option, a different \nperspective. \n\n \n\nAccording to Figure 4.7, option \u201cEquivalence and Recognition of academic \n\ndegrees\u201d, had a total a 73 calls with nearly 35.4% lost calls. This was only \n\nsurpassed by \u201cTariff and Accreditation\u201d option with nearly 35.96% of \n\nunanswered calls. \u201cCertificates and Diplomas\u201d present the best rate of \n\nanswered calls, only leaving about 9.14% of unanswered calls. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 \u2013 Calls distribution by IVR option and by operator. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.8 shows an interesting fact, there are two operators responding to \n\nIVR option \u201cOther issues\u201d. This is because in the first days the IVR was \n\nimplemented there were actually two operators for option 5 of the IVR menu, \n\nwhich was changed afterwards. It also suggests that option \u201cAccess to \n\nUniversity\u201d and \u201cOther issues\u201d should have at least one more agent to answer \n\ncalls, this will help to balance work load and will function has a redundancy \n\nif one of those agents is out. Figure 4.8 indicates a big variation on agents \n\nanswering calls for option \u201cApplication and Enrollment\u201d, i.e., there are \n\nagents taking a very small amount of calls. This is furthered detailed in Figure \n\n4.9. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n39 \n\n \n\nFigure 4.9 \u2013 Answered and Unanswered calls distributed by agent for IVR option \n\"Application and Enrollment\" \n\n \n\nThe unanswered calls represents 32% of calls received by IVR option \n\n\u201cApplication and Enrollment\u201d. Extension 1113 takes about 55.31% of total \n\ncalls received by this option. \n\nFigure 4.9 shows that the combined five agents taking fewer calls represent \n\nless than 13% of the total calls, with four of those operators having \n\nindividually less than 3% of all calls for this option. The unanswered calls \n\naccount for more than the double of those five agents answered calls. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 \u2013 Average conversation and average waiting time by Answered and \nUnanswered calls. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.10 indicates that average waiting time for answered calls is about 1 \n\nminute and 29 seconds. The average call length is 3 minutes and 37 seconds. \n\nThe average frustration time before a client ends the call before an agent \n\nadd the chance to pick it up is about 3 minutes. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.11 \u2013 Average answered and unanswered waiting time distributed by IVR \noption. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n41 \n\nThe waiting time before an agent picks up the call varies according to IVR \n\noption. For answered calls, Figure 4.11 shows less waiting time for \u201cAccess \n\nto University\u201d option with an average of 39 seconds and greater waiting time \n\nfor \u201cApplication and Enrollment\u201d with an average of 2 minutes and 6 seconds.  \n\nAverage frustration time also differs according to selected IVR option. This \n\nshows that clients are more willing to wait for option \u201cAccess to University\u201d \n\nwith 4 minutes and 3 seconds and \u201cTariff and Accreditations\u201d with and 4 \n\nminutes and 8 seconds. Clients are less willing to wait for \u201cApplication and \n\nEnrollment\u201d with 2 minutes and 44 seconds. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 \u2013 Answered and unanswered calls waiting time (over 10 minutes) by IVR \noption. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.12 shows the number of calls over 10 minutes for answered and \n\nunanswered groups. It also presents cumulative waiting time for those calls \n\nper IVR option.  \n\n\u201cApplication and Enrollment\u201d has 46 answered calls with more than 10 \n\nminutes, the answered and unanswered calls for this option sum 13 hours 1 \n\nminute and 50 seconds of waiting. \u201cOther issues\u201d option has 17 unanswered \n\ncalls with more than 10 minutes. The answered and unanswered calls with \n\nmore than 10 minutes for this option, represent 9 hours 28 minutes and 26 \n\nseconds of waiting time. \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.13 \u2013 Number of unanswered calls with waiting time bigger than 3 minutes. \n\n \n\nAccording to Figure 4.13 there are 20.16% of calls lost from unanswered calls, \n\nfor waiting times between for 3 minutes and 5 minutes. For this study 3 \n\nminutes is the average waiting time before frustration takes place. For \n\nwaiting times between 5 minutes and 10 minutes there are 185 calls and \n\nrepresents about 10.35% of unanswered calls. \n\nThere are 50 unanswered calls with more than 10 minutes of waiting time, \n\nwhich represent 0.689% of total calls (answered and unanswered) and only \n\n2.8% of unanswered calls. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n43 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14 \u2013 Answered and unanswered maximum waiting time bye IVR option. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.14 shows the maximum waiting times ever recorded during this \n\nstudy. For answered calls the best time goes to \u201cTariff and Accreditation\u201d \n\noption, while the worst goes to \u201cOther issues\u201d.  \n\nFor unanswered calls there as one call willing to wait for 1 hour 2 minutes \n\nand 21 seconds before giving up in option \u201cAccess to University\u201d. \n\nThe minimum waiting time for answered calls vary from 3 seconds to 11 \n\nseconds. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.15 \u2013 Average conversation time by IVR option. \n\n \n\nThe average conversation time presents the smaller value for \u201cEquivalence \n\nand Recognition of academic degrees\u201d option. The biggest average value is \n\nfor \u201cTariff and Accreditations\u201d.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.16 \u2013 Cumulative conversation time distributed by agents. \n\n \n\n\n\nResults and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n45 \n\nFigure 4.16 shows the cumulative conversation time by every agent on the \n\nIVR option menu. It is no big surprise that extension 1113 is the one with \n\nmore time spent on the phone, since it was the one that answered to more \n\ncalls, with 170 hours 9 minutes and 9 seconds of conversation time.   \n\nTotal conversation time from all agents is 330 hours 37 minutes and 29 \n\nseconds. Putting this value to perspective, it means 41 days 3 hours 37 \n\nminutes and 29 seconds of one person workdays doing nothing more than \n\ntalking to the phone. \n\nThe following six graphics are presented separately because they present \n\nvery different characteristics, according to IVR menu option. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.17 \u2013 Number of calls, average waiting time and IVR option \u201cAccess to \nUniversity\u201d distributed by hourly bucket. \n\n \n\nFrom Figure 4.17 it is perceived that there are two periods with more call \n\ninflows. One period in the morning between 10h and 12h59m, the other \n\nperiod refers to the afternoon period between 14h and 16h59m. The \n\nanswered average waiting time seems to be unaffected by peak hours. \n\nInteresting is the fact that it is in the morning, between 9h and 10h59m, \n\nwhere clients are willing to wait more time before hang-up the call. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 \u2013 Number of calls, average waiting time and IVR option \u201cApplication and \nEnrollment\u201d distributed by hourly bucket. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.18 presents two peak periods for receiving calls, one in the morning \n\nbetween 10h and 12h59m and one bigger in the afternoon from 14h to \n\n16h59m.

One period in the \n\nmorning between 11h and 11h59m, the other period refers to the afternoon \n\nperiod between 14h and 14h59m. The answered average waiting time \n\nappears affected in the afternoon period, but shows no relation to peak hours \n\nin the morning period. Unanswered number of calls follows the trend \n\nrevealed by answered calls.  \n\nThe periods where clients are willing to wait more are from 10h to 11h59m \n\nand from 14h to 15h59m.  \n\nFrom Figure 4.17, Figure 4.18, Figure 4.19, Figure 4.21 and Figure 4.22 it\u2019s \n\npossible to observe that there are some calls being answered after 13h. This \n\noverlaps with the lunch break for workers at the Academic Services. Figure \n\n4.20 is the only one that doesn\u2019t present such fact. This happens, according \n\nto Figure 1.3, because IVR Academic Services costumer contact and ticketing \n\nis available until 13h. So a call entering the system near 13h will span over \n\nlunch break. As data suggests, a change in IVR availability hours should take \n\nplace in a near future. \n\nAccording to Figure 4.10 the average frustration time is about 3 minutes and \n\nin consonance to Figure 4.15, the longest average conversation time is 4 \n\nminutes and 35 seconds. The sum of this values is 7 minutes and 35 seconds. \n\nThe IVR for Academic Services costumer contact and ticketing should stop \n\ntaking new calls before 12 hours 52 minutes and 25 second.  \n\nThese preliminary results will allow high level management to re-organize \n\nthe human resources around the real workload as evidenced by the collected \n\ndata, therefore allowing the external users to perceive a more efficient \n\nservice, and the internal users to focus where the workload is increased. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nConclusions and future work \n\n \n\n \n\n51 \n\nChapter 5 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5. Conclusions and future work \n\nDespite the massive spread of self-service Web applications, Gartner states \n\nthat 92% of all customer transactions still take place over the telephone. This \n\nnumber is more likely to increase if the destination is a toll-free number [23]. \n\nMany systems that use IVRs have a very bad reputation, in many cases well \n\ndeserved, although it\u2019s a precious tool for many call/contact centers. Well-\n\ndesigned IVRs can provide the caller the most skilled agent to handle his/her \n\nmatter at the first contact.  \n\nPoorly designed they can become a source of frustration and annoyance, one \n\ngood example of this is the call being routed to someone that can\u2019t help the \n\ncaller. Even worst is the call being transferred over and over again by agents \n\nthat still can\u2019t help. It\u2019s not the IVR systems that customers hate, it\u2019s the \n\nway they are configured, as the technology itself is completely neutral. \n\nIVR is usually the first touch-point most consumers have. It either facilitates \n\npositive experiences or negative experiences. Many information technology \n\nadministrators configure these systems and then leave them to be like a self \n\nsustaining system. This was already established to be a big mistake, with \n\nmany enterprises loosing clients, as research proves it.  \n\nAn IVR is like any piece of software or hardware, it needs maintenance and \n\nmonitoring. Maintenance might be from a software/hardware perspective, \n\ni.e.: \n\n- Are all options well configured and routed to at least one operator? \n\n- Are equipment\u2019s still handling traffic volume? \n\n- Do logs reveal any malfunction? \n\n- How is sound quality? \n\n \n\n\n\nThese are very important questions, but aren\u2019t the only ones. From a \n\nbusiness intelligence perspective there are still questions to be answered, \n\nfor example: \n\n- How many calls the system gets? \n\n- Are menu options still relevant? \n\n- Are they in the correct order (most required in first place)? \n\n- Do the options with most hits have the correct number of workers? \n\n- What is the percentage of answered/unanswered calls? \n\n- Are menu options intuitive and the wording clear? \n\n- What is the average frustration time? \n\n- Do peak times have more agents to answer calls? \n\nIn monitoring, it\u2019s possible to identify positive and negative aspects. IVR \n\nsystems are like any other system, they need maintenance and monitoring. \n\nIn a quality culture, an important insight is that failure or success is always \n\na value formed after certain facts.  \n\nTreating large amounts of data and extract concise information in a timely \n\nmanner from it it\u2019s vital nowadays. Iterate, monitor, and iterate in a \n\nconstant cycle will guarantee the best decisions based on current \n\nexperience, information and understanding, so that the IVR continue running \n\nefficiently and be an effective tool for both users and agents.  \n\nThe suggested a multidimensional data analysis model using data cube \n\nextracts comprehensive analysis results that fits the two proposed \n\nassumptions: maintain comprehensive historical data and service monitoring.  \n\nThe views presented in the results section are representative of the full \n\npower of this analysis, as the IVRCube makes it possible to create all types \n\nof views on the data by gathering and filtering the various dimensions. \n\nThe system is used to conduct a multidimensional analysis through an OLAP \n\noperation according to the level of abstraction for each dimension. Analysis \n\nsystem using data cube can easily and timely extract comprehensive analysis \n\nresults showing relevant trends. It can be used as a decision support system \n\nfor business intelligence. A properly optimized IVR can lead to higher rates \n\n\n\nConclusions and future work \n\n \n\n \n\n53 \n\nof satisfaction while lowering costs. The continuous improvement provides \n\nthe ability to find potential enhancements that may otherwise go unnoticed. \n\n \n\n5.1. Future Work \n\nThe ultimate objective is to create a dashboard for the University\u2019s high level \n\nmanagement, so the information that the system provides can be effectively \n\nand timely used to make correct management decisions, namely by allowing \n\nthe re-allocation of resources considering date, time and workload \n\nconstraints.  \n\nEfficiency and productivity are key aspects in network and \n\ntelecommunication systems, therefore in the long term, I foresee many \n\nopportunities to apply analytical technologies as the one presented in this \n\nwork, giving me purpose and motivation for future developments. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nReferences \n\n \n\n \n\n55 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReferences \n \n\n[1]  \"University of Beira Interior Home Page,\" 2014.

The telephone \n\nexchanges allows employees to perform internal connections between telephones, or make calls to \n\nthe external network (PSTN) also known as Public Switched Telephone Network. With increasing \n\nInternet usage, there is interest in understanding what services are offered. FreePBX is an open \n\nsource Asterisk web-based PBX software for Linux, which supports multiple protocols and services, \n\nlike Interactive Voice Response (IVR). Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) or \n\nCallManager, is a software-based call-processing system developed by Cisco Systems. CUCM tracks \n\nall active VoIP network components; including phones, gateways, conference bridges, among others. \n\nIVR is part of the Academic Services costumer contact and ticketing of University of Beira Interior \n\n(UBI). IVR monitoring and analysis are essential for effective operation and resource management, in \n\nparticular, multidimensional analysis for long-term data is necessary for comprehensive \n\nunderstanding of the trend, the quality of customer service and costumer experience. In this paper, \n\nwe propose a new IVR analysis model for large volumes of IVR data accumulated over a long period \n\nof time. The IVRCube proposed is an analysis model using online analytical processing (OLAP) on a \n\nmultidimensional data cube that provides an easy and fast way to construct a multidimensional IVR \n\nanalysis system for comprehensive and detailed analysis of long-term data. The feasibility and \n\napplicability are validate, as the proposed IVRCube analysis model is implemented and applied it to \n\nAcademic Services costumer contact and ticketing IVR data. \n\n  \n\n  \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Systems\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoIP\n\n\nI. Introduction: \n\nUniversity of Beira Interior (UBI) [1] started the convergence of the phone system and the data \n\nnetwork in 2005, after acquiring a commercial Internet Protocol (IP) Private Branch Exchange (PBX) \n\nsoftware from Cisco called CallManager [2]. The long term UBI objective, was to have 100% Voice \n\nover IP (VoIP) network until 2020. The Internet Protocol Private Branch eXchange (IP PBX) was \n\nintegrated with the analogical PBX\u2019s and with the Public switched telephone network (PSTN). Figure \n\n1 presents a scheme depicting CallManager integration in the UBI voice architecture. In Figure 1 E-\n\ncarrier (E1) represents a Primary Rate Interface (PRI). PRI is a standardized telecommunications \n\nservice level within the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). E1 provides 30 communication \n\nchannels and 2 signaling channels, this is also referred to as 30B channels plus 2D channels. In this \n\ncase Media Gateway has 60 voice channels to interconnect VoIP and legacy telephony.  \n\nE1\n\nMedia Gateway\nE1\n\nIP PBX Call Manager\n\nE1\n\nPSTN\n\nIP\n\nTrunk\n\nIP Phones\n\nIP\n\nAnalogical Phones\n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Scheme depicting CallManager Integration. \n\nIn 2007, Portuguese Universities started to transform their phone systems in favor of a converged \n\nsystem using the data network to route phone calls. This project, named VoIP@RCTS [3] was \n\nlaunched by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Computa\u00e7\u00e3o Cient\u00edfica Nacional (FCCN), the Portuguese National \n\nResearch and Education Network (NREN). The chosen solution was a software platform based on \n\nFreePBX [4] witch uses the Asterisk core [5]. This software although it\u2019s based on FreePBX it has \n\nbeen redesigned to suite Universities specifications. This new software is called Enterprise Courier \n\nfrom itCenter [6]. UBI integrated that same project called VoIP@RCTS and incorporated in its \n\ntelephone system. Figure 2 illustrates UBI integration of VoIP@RCTS in the existing infrastructure of \n\nUBI. In Figure 2 we can also see the Session Based Controller (SBC) that acts as a firewall for the VoIP \n\nworld. \n\nTelephony\n\nOperators\n\nE1\n\nSBC\n\nIP\n\nTrunk\n\nIP PBX\n\nEnterprise Courier\n\nIP PBX Call Manager\n\nIP \n\nTrunk\n\nIP\n\nTrunk\n\nIP Trunk\n\nPSTN\n\nBackup\n\nIP\n\nTrunk\n\nIP Phones\n\nIP\n\nAnalogical Phones\n\nMedia Gateway\nE1\n\nE1\n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Integration of VoIP@RCTS in UBI infrastructure. \n\n\n\nAlthough the provided solution was based on open source software, it was customized for the \n\nspecific needs of the universities, therefore, Enterprise Courier offers new possibilities to explore. \n\nOne of the offered possibilities is the use of IVR, which suited some of the specific services, by \n\nallowing the calling user select the most adequate operator for his/her particular call motivation.  \n\nThe actual flow diagram for the IVR in study (Academic Services costumer contact and ticketing) is \n\nshowed in Figure 3. \n\nCall to one of the \ndirect dial numbers\n\nCheck time and \nweek day\n\nOut of schedule\n\nPresents a recording with the following options:\n\n0 \u2013 Access to University\n\n1 \u2013 Application and Enrollment\n\n2 \u2013 Certificates and Diplomas\n\n3 \u2013 Tariff a nd Accreditations\n\n4 \u2013 Equivalence and Recognition of academic degrees\n\n5 \u2013 Other issues\n\nWorking days from 9h to 13:00h or 14h to 17:45h\n\nTerminate Call\nEnd\n\nChecks the \noption\n\nDial:\n2034\n\nOption 0\nOption 1\n\nDial:\n1093\n1095\n1097\n1105\n1113\n\nOption 2\n\nDial:\n1105\n1109\n1113\n\nOption 3\n\nDial:\n1100\n1101\n\nOption 4\n\nDial:\n1115\n1116\n\nEnd\n\nDirect Dial:\nExt. 1111\n\n275320690\n808200105\n\nDial:\n1113\n\nOption 5\n\nAfter 5 seconds without choosing an option\n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Flowchart for the IVR Academic Services costumer contact and ticketing. \n\n \n\n\n\nUBI seeks to continuously improve its organizational structure, its processes and its control methods, \n\naiming to satisfy and anticipate the requirements of its customers and other stakeholders.  \n\nYet, the Enterprise Courier does not provide IVR statistics, and therefore, there are no metrics that \n\nallow UBI to evaluate and plan improvements in the area of automated telephone response. \n\nTherefore, in 2013, the Vice-Rector for Academic Affairs, recognized as the main stakeholder, \n\nrequired that monitoring and supervision would need to be implemented in the Academic Services \n\ncostumer contact and ticketing IVR system. \n\nHaving this in consideration, this paper describes the research carried out that will allow the future \n\ncreation of a solution that allows monitoring and supervision, for example, get a relationship \n\nbetween how many calls an option receives and which operator takes it, or how many minutes does \n\na call last, or how many seconds is a client on hold until he starts to talk with the operator, on an \n\nAsterisk based software. \n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: this paragraph concludes section 1, the \n\nIntroduction, where the problem, motivations and objectives of the research were outlined; section \n\n2 follows, describing the state of the art; section 3 presents the architecture and the solution; \n\nsection 4 describes and discusses the results obtained; and finally section 5 concludes de the paper \n\npresenting conclusions and future work.   \n\n \n\n \n\nII. State of the Art: \n\nModern networks are constantly evolving to meet user demands. Initial data networks were limited \n\nto exchanging character-based information between connected computer systems. Traditional \n\ntelephone, radio, and television networks were maintained separately from data networks. In the \n\npast, every one of these services required a dedicated network, with different communication \n\nchannels and different technologies to carry a particular communication signal. Each service had its \n\nown set of rules and standards to ensure successful communication. \n\nAdvances in technology are enabling us to consolidate these different kinds of networks onto one \n\nplatform referred to as the \u201cconverged network\u201d. Unlike dedicated networks, converged networks \n\nare capable of delivering voice, video streams, text, and graphics between many different types of \n\ndevices over the same communication channel and network structure. Previously separate and \n\ndistinct communication forms have converged into a common platform [7]. \n\nCompared to traditional telephony (circuit switching), VoIP is now more scalable, allows the \nintegration of new features and the possibility of reducing costs. From the perspective of data \nnetworks, VoIP has transform the voice into just another application [5]. In particular some VoIP \napplications allow IVR configuration. IVR allows call handling in order to give some sort of response \nto them without human interaction. Being the caller responsible to choose one of the options that \nare presented. IVR is usually presented in a form of a menu that can have many layers or submenus \nand are composed by audio files played to the caller, witch, through touch keys on the phone can \ninteract with the system, for example, allowing the creation of a voting system via phone, money \ntransfer from a bank account or to choose the more skilled operator in certain subject [8].  \n\nSome VoIP applications have add-on tools that allow to create IVR processes using drag and drop. In \nthis category there at least three popular solutions, one from Alcatel Lucent called OmniTouch \n\n\n\nContact Center [9] and the other from Cisco called Unified Contact Center Express [2]. Both are \ncommercial, have various license options according to the desired functionality range and integrate \ntheir respective unified VoIP solutions. On the other hand, in the open source world we have \nAsterisk [5] or Asterisk based systems, where IVRs are abstractions created from fragments of the \ndial plan and have no special treatment. \n\nThe commercial solution from Alcatel Lucent also has built-in statistics reports. According to their \ndocumentation, this product has a range of reports of real-time details on service activity, individual \nagent, agent group activity and statistics on each type of interaction [9]. \n\nThe Cisco platform has one add-on tool called Cisco Unified IP IVR that has this functionality. This \ntool can create reports for application performance analysis report, detailed call by call report and \ntraffic analysis report [2].  \n\nIn Asterisk based systems, CDR-stats [10] is a separate application that analyses the Call Detail \nRecords (CDR) and creates statistics from there. It\u2019s not by any mean IVR specialized, but is one \ninteresting tool for CDR reporting. There are two options: professional support (commercial version) \nor community support (free to use). QueueMetrics [11] is specialized for call centers and has a \nspecial treatment for IVR, it can be integrated with some Asterisk based systems and it\u2019s a \ncommercial solution with a license renewal every four years. This software creates reports for total \ncalls, answered calls, unanswered calls, area code breakdown, inbound call attempts, Call \ndistribution, Agents, Outcomes and Call detail. \n\n \n\n \n\nIII. Architecture and solution to the problem: A comprehensive IVR analysis model using online \n\nanalytical processing on a multidimensional data cube: \n\nResponding to the constant need for improvement stated in UBI\u2019s 2020 mission and previously \n\npresented in the introduction section, a system analysis approach was used to define the solution \n\ndevelopment process. \n\nThe identified relevant stakeholders were, primarily, the Vice-Rector for the Academic Affairs, and \n\nalso, too much lesser extent, the users at the Academic Services, and external users that contact UBI \n\nusing the telephone. \n\nBased on the interviews conducted with the stakeholders, the following list of functional \n\nrequirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR) was produced for the answered calls: \n\nFR1: The system must be able to provide metrics on the efficiency of the incoming calls, e.g., \n\nthe system must provide information about the answered calls per day or set of consecutive \n\ndays, month or set of consecutive months, quarter or set of consecutive months and year or \n\nset of consecutive years;  \n\nFR2: The system must be able to provide information about the answered calls per operator \n\nnumber; FR3: The system must be able to provide information about the distribution of the \n\nincoming calls, i.e. the system must provide information about the answered calls per IVR \n\nmenu option; \n\nFR4: The system must be able to provide information about the time spent, i.e. the system \n\nmust provide information about the waiting time and conversation time. \n\nNRF1: The system must not install any software in the IP PBX Enterprise Courier. \n\n\n\nNRF2: The system must not interfere with the IP PBX system, e.g. the system must not alter \n\nthe IP PBX databases. \n\nNRF3: The system must not interfere with the VoIP performance. \n\nIt must be noted that this list of requirements is not final, as the approach to the development of the \n\nsystem was performed in a prototyping manner, thus allowing the stakeholders to refine the \n\nrequirements list, i.e., the results that the system must output will be subject of continuous \n\nimprovement. \n\nThe IP PBX Enterprise Courier stores locally, in a MySQL database, information about all calls in a \n\nformat named Call Detail Record (CDR) and in particular, calls that enters into the IVR. The structure \n\nof the CDR has the following fields: calldate, clid, src, dst, dcontext, channel, \ndstchannel, lastapp, lastdata, duration, billsec, disposition, \n\namaflags, accountcode, uniqueid and userfield. From this list of fields we have \n\nspecial interest in: calldate, src, dst, duration, billsec and uniqueid. The field \n\ncalldate has the timestamp for the call beginning and is a datetime type. The field src has the \n\ncall source, e.g. \u201c+351275319700\u201dand is a varchar type. The field dst has the call destination, e.g. \n\n\u201c1113\u201d and is a varchar type. The field duration has the call total time and it is of int type. The field \n\nbillsec has the call conversation time and it is of int type. The field uniqueid has the id for the \n\ncall in question and is a varchar type.  \n\nThe relevant data fields [12] for this study are retrieved from Enterprise Courier IP PBX by the data \n\nwarehouse and are stored for comprehensive and detailed analysis as it is showed in Figure 4. The \n\ndata warehouse retrieval SQL job, fetches new data and runs twice a day, but it can be adjusted for \n\nmore sensitive real-time data, if required.  \n\nIP PBX \u2013 Enterprise Courier\nInstitutional\n\nData Warehouse\n\nCDR \n\nLocal storage\n\nJob \n\nRetreives New \nData\n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Data retrieval scheme. \n\nWith the imported data, a multidimensional data model is constructed at the institutional data \n\nwarehouse. This model views data in the form of a data cube [13] [14] [15]. A data cube allows data \n\nto be modeled, viewed and filtered in multiple dimensions. The cube is defined by dimensions and \n\nfacts [16]. Dimension tables are integral companions to a fact table. The dimension tables contain \n\nthe textual descriptors. Each dimension is defined by its single primary key, designated by the PK \n\nnotation in Figure 5, which serves as the basis for referential integrity with any given fact table to \n\nwhich it is joined. Dimension table attributes play a vital role in the data warehouse. Since they are \n\nthe source of virtually all interesting constraints. [17]  \n\nA fact table is the primary table in a dimensional model [16]. The fact table contains the names of \n\nthe facts, or measures, in this case \u201cwait_time\u201d and \u201cconversation_time\u201d, according to Figure 5. In \n\naddition to these measures, calculated measures where introduced based on this this two primary \n\n\n\nmeasures, MAX_wait_time as the maximum value for wait_time, MIN_wait_time as the minimum \n\nvalue for wait_time, Avg_wait_time as the average value for wait_time, MAX_conversation_time as \n\nthe maximum value for conversation_time, MIN_conversation_time as the minimum value for \n\nconversation_time and Avg_conversation_time as the average value for conversation_time were \n\nintroduced, as well foreign keys to each related dimension tables, designated by the FK notation in \n\nFigure 5. The fact table itself generally has its own primary key made up of a subset of the foreign \n\nkeys. This key is often called a composite or concatenated key, in Figure 5 is showed as id_call. A \n\ndata warehouse requires a concise, subject-oriented schema that facilitates online data analysis. A \n\nstar schema [14] for the multidimensional analysis model, figure 5, with the fact table in the middle. \n\nAs this schema was applied on IVR data, it was decided to call it IVRCube. \n\nIVR_HIT_ Academics\n\nid_callPK\n\nwait_ti me\n\nconversation_ti me\n\nTi meKeyFK\n\nPK_DateFK\n\nid_IVRFK\n\nid_SRCFK\n\nid_DSTFK\n\nDIM_IVR_OPTION\n\nid_IVRPK\n\noption\n\nDescription\n\nDIM_SRC\n\nid_SRCPK\n\nnumber\n\nDIM_DST\n\nid_DSTPK\n\nnumber\n\nDIM_CALENDAR\n\nPK_DatePK\n\nYear\n\nMonth\n\nDIM_TIME\n\nTi meKeyPK\n\nHourlyBucket\n\nDay\n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Cube structure view. \n\nIn this paper, we defined five dimensions [18]: CALENDAR, TIME, DST (stands for destination), SRC \n\n(stands for source) and IVR_OPTION. The DST dimension has all possible destination numbers, in this \n\nstudy, it\u2019s the operator numbers. SRC dimension has all source numbers from the data source. SRC \n\nand DST dimensions has all sources and destinations respectively, from the data source, and are \n\nautomatically populate in the retrieval job, Figure 4.  The calendar dimension is the one dimension \n\nnearly guaranteed to be in every data mart, because virtually every data mart is a time series. \n\nCalendar Dimension was created with an SQL script and has all possible data from 2014 until 2020. \n\nTIME dimension gives a perspective of how hours of the day may influence the service (for example \n\npeak hours). TIME Dimension was created with an SQL script and has all possible hours from 00h \n\nuntil 24h, distributed in hourly bucket. The IVR_OPTION dimension has all possible options the \n\nclients can choose from the IVR menu. This was the only dimension that was manually populated \n\nwith the names of the possible options of the IVR menu, e.g. \u201cAccess to University\u201d, according to \n\nFigure 3.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nIV. Results \n\nThe IVR is running since late January of 2014 and the presented results span this period until late July \n\n2014. In this study only answered calls will be analyzed. Results may be presented in table form, or \n\nas charts. In this section, some of the most relevant views from the multidimensional analysis are \n\npresented, describing views from the multidimensional analysis in the form of graphics.  \n\nIn Figure 6 we can see the distribution of calls by the various IVR options. \n\n \n\nFigure 6 \u2013 Answered calls distribution of by IVR options. \n\nThe \u201cAccess to University\u201d and \u201cApplication and Enrollment\u201d options represent possible interest in \n\nthe University and combined have a total of 42% of total calls, followed by the \u201cOther issues\u201d option \n\nthat represents a total a 33% from a total of 3337 answered calls. \n\n \n\nFigure 7 represents the distribution of calls during the period of this research. \n\n \n\nFigure 7 \u2013 Calls distributed by month. \n\n\n\nIn the monthly distribution, January had a very small number of calls, most likely because it was \n\nwhen the IVR service was created and it wasn\u2019t properly advertised. Calls volume doubles in July \n\ncompared to previous months. In Figure 8, additional detail shows the evolution on the motivation \n\nfor the calls in month of July and compares it to calls in the month of June. \n\n \n\nFigure 8 \u2013 Call details for June and July. \n\nThe month of July, Figure 8, shows a global increase in all call options. In particular the options: \n\n\u201cAccess to University\u201d, \u201cApplication and Enrollment\u201d. In Portugal, July is period of the year where \n\nstudents choose which University they want to enroll, which accounts for the increase in these \n\noptions. The \u201cCertificate and Diplomas\u201d option also has a significant increase due to the school year \n\nend. \n\nFigure 9 presents the distribution of calls per IVR operator. \n\n \n\nFigure 9 \u2013 Calls distribution by operator. \n\nThis figure shows all 3337 answered calls distributed by all IVR operators. The operator that as most \n\nof the calls is extension 1113, and according to Figure 3, this is perfectly acceptable since this \n\noperator responds to three options of IVR menu, as showed in the Figure 10. \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 10 \u2013 Calls distribution by IVR option and by operator. \n\n \n\nFigure 10 also shows an interesting fact, as there are two operators responding to IVR option \u201cOther \n\nissues\u201d. This is because in the first days the IVR was implemented there were actually two operators \n\nfor option 5 of the IVR menu, which was changed afterwards. \n\n \n\nFigure 11 \u2013 Conversation and waiting time averages by IVR option. \n\nFigure 11 presents the time, in minutes, users spend in the telephony system. It shows that the \n\naverage conversation time spans from 3 minutes and 18 seconds in option \u201cApplication and \n\nEnrollment\u201d to 4 minutes and 1 second in \u201cTariff and Accreditations\u201d option. Figure 11 also shows \n\nthat the average waiting time spans from 41 seconds in \u201cAccess to University\u201d option to 1 minute \n\nand 21 seconds in \u201cTariff and Accreditations\u201d.  \n\n\n\n \n\nFigure 12 \u2013 Maximum vs minimum waiting time by IVR option. \n\nAccording to Figure 12, the maximum waiting time spans from 8 minutes and 22 seconds in \u201cTariff \n\nand Accreditations\u201d to 24 minutes and 19 seconds in \u201cCertificates and Diplomas\u201d. The minimum \n\nwaiting time spans from 4 seconds in \u201cOther issues\u201d to 11 seconds in \u201cTariff and Accreditations\u201d. \n\nThese preliminary results will allow high level management to re-organize the human resources \n\naround the real workload as evidenced by the collected data, therefore allowing the external users \n\nto perceive a more efficient service, and the internal users to focus where the workload is increased. \n\n \n\n \n\nV. Conclusion \n\nWith the emergence of technologies such as Voice over IP and the easy inherited ability to store \n\nrecords in a database, new challenges regarding the use of this data are addressed. Treating large \n\namounts of data and extracting a concise and timely relevant information allow to make decisions \n\nthat may improve the performance of the systems and the way people deal with these systems.  \n\nThe views presented in the results section are only representative of the full power of this analysis, \n\nas the IVRCube makes it possible to create all types of views on the data by gathering and filtering \n\nthe various dimensions. \n\nWe suggested a multidimensional data analysis model using data cube to elicit comprehensive \n\nanalysis results that fits at least two purposes: keep comprehensive historical data and monitoring \n\nthe service. The system can be used to conduct a multidimensional analysis through an OLAP \n\noperation according to the level of abstraction for each dimension. Because the analysis system \n\nusing data cube can easily extract comprehensive analysis results within the viewpoints of trend it \n\ncan be used beyond monitoring.  \n\nThe ultimate objective is to create a dashboard for the University\u2019s high level management, so that \n\nthe information the system provides can be effectively and timely used to make correct \n\nmanagement decisions, namely by allowing the re-allocation of resources considering date and time \n\nworkload constraints.  \n\n\n\n \n\nBibliography \n\n \n\n[1]  \"University of Beira Interior Home Page,\" 2014.
