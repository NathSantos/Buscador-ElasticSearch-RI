When skin is injured, \n\na complex process of regeneration begins. To promote skin regeneration it may be coated with \n\nproper biomaterials that contribute for the restoration of skin structure and functions, by \n\nreducing the risk of infection, avoiding dehydration, pain and reducing the formation of scar. \n\nHerein, a new sponges (S) aimed to promote skin regeneration ware developed. The materials \n\nused of the production this sponge were: Chitosan and Gelatin. \n\nSponges were coated with a membrane (M), the materials used were deacetylated Chitosan, \n\nPoly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) and Poly (?-caprolactone) (PCL), mimicking the natural anatomy \n\nand physiology of skin. The coated sponge (CS) produced is biocompatible, biodegradable, anti-\n\ninflammatory and antimicrobial porous structure that allow the difusion of nutrients and waste \n\nproducts. Furthermore, Ibuprofen was also loaded at sponges to improve the skin regenenation, \n\nby decreasing wound edema and decreased production of inflammatory mediators. \n\nThe structure of the biomaterials developed here (S, M and CS) were initially characterized by \n\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Ther morphology was characterized by scanning \n\nelectron microscopy (SEM). Cellular adhesion and internalization into the porous structures of \n\nthe biomaterials were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The cytotoxicity \n\nprofile of the biomaterials were characterized through 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-\n\n2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays and the results obtained confirmed their biocompatibility. \n\nThe antimicrobial activity of the sponges were also evaluated and the results showed that they \n\nwere able to inhibit the growth, at the surface, of the most common microorganism in skin \n\ninfection (Staphylococcus aureus). In conclusion, the produced porous sponges has suitable \n\nproperties for improving the healing process of cutaneous wounds. \n\n \n\nKeywords: Quitosan, skin regeneration, coated sponge, freeze drying and electrospinning. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nix \n \n\nResumo \n\n \n\nA pele \u00e9 o maior \u00f3rg\u00e3o do corpo humano e este \u00f3rg\u00e3o est\u00e1 envolvido na preserva\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nhomeostase dos fluidos corporais, manuten\u00e7\u00e3o da temperatura e protec\u00e7\u00e3o contra agentes \n\ninfecciosos. Quando a estrutura da pele \u00e9 comprometida inicia-se um complexo processo de \n\nregenera\u00e7\u00e3o. Para promover este processo a pele pode ser revestida com biomateriais com o \n\nobjectivo de reduzir o risco de infec\u00e7\u00e3o, desidrata\u00e7\u00e3o, dor e a forma\u00e7\u00e3o de cicatriz. \n\nNo presente estudo foram desenvolvidas novas esponjas (S) para a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o da pele. Os \n\nmateriais utilizados na sua produ\u00e7\u00e3o foram: O Quitosano e a Gelatina.  \n\nPor outro lado as esponjas tamb\u00e9m foram revestidas com uma membrana (M), em que os \n\nmateriais usados foram o Quitosano desacetilado, \u00d3xido de polietileno (PEO) e policaprolactona \n\n(PCL), imitando a anatomia e fisiologia natural da pele. A esponja revestida (CS) \u00e9 \n\nbiocompat\u00edvel, biodegrad\u00e1vel, possi uma estrutura porosa com propriedades antimicrobianas, \n\nque permite a difus\u00e3o de nutrientes e produtos residuais. Al\u00e9m disso, no interior do CS as \n\nc\u00e9lulas permacem vi\u00e1veis e ocorre a prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o. O Ibuprofeno foi tamb\u00e9m incorporado nas \n\nesponjas para acelarar a regenera\u00e7\u00e3o da pele, ao diminuir o edema da ferida por diminui\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nda produ\u00e7\u00e3o de mediadores inflamat\u00f3rios. \n\nA estrutura dos biomateriais produzidos, foram analisadas por espectroscopia de infravermelho \n\ncom transformada de Fourier (FTIR). A morfologia da superf\u00edcie e do interior das esponjas foi \n\ncaracterizada por microscopia eletr\u00f3nica de varrimento (SEM). A ades\u00e3o celular e \n\ninternaliza\u00e7\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas nas estruturas porosas foram visualizadas atrav\u00e9s de imagens de \n\nmicroscopia confocal. Os perfis citotoxidos dos biomateriais foram caracterizados por meio de \n\nensaios de viabilidade celular, e os resultados obtidos confirmaram a sua biocompatibilidade. \n\nA actividade antimicrobiana dos biomateriais foi tamb\u00e9m avaliada e os resultados mostraram \n\nque as esponjas inibem o crescimento na sua superf\u00edcie, do microrganismo mais comum das \n\ninfec\u00e7\u00f5es de pele (Staphylococcus aureus). As estruturas porosas t\u00eam propriedades adequadas \n\npara melhorar o processo de cicatriza\u00e7\u00e3o de feridas cut\u00e2neas. \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave: Quitosano, regenera\u00e7\u00e3o da pele, espoja revestida, liofiliza\u00e7\u00e3o electrospining. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\nx \n \n\nResumo alargado \n\n \n\nA pele \u00e9 o maior \u00f3rg\u00e3o do corpo humano, representando cerca de 7 % da massa corporal, \n\nchegando a atingir uma extens\u00e3o de 2m2 num adulto. Este tecido tem como principal fun\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nservir de barreira protetora do organismo, protegendo contra infe\u00e7\u00f5es. Por outro lado, este \n\norg\u00e3o tamb\u00e9m preserva a hem\u00f3stase dos fluidos do corpo humano e ajuda na regula\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\ntemperatura corporal. A pele \u00e9 constitu\u00edda por tr\u00eas diferentes camadas: Epiderme (camada \n\nexterna), Derme (camada interm\u00e9dia) e Hipoderme (camada interna). \n\nDiariamente a pele est\u00e1 sujeita a les\u00f5es, que podem ser causadas por queimaduras, cirurgias, \n\ntraumas, contus\u00f5es e hematomas. Estas les\u00f5es levam \u00e0 disrup\u00e7\u00e3o do tecido quer a n\u00edvel \n\nanat\u00f3mico quer a n\u00edvel funcional.  \n\nAp\u00f3s ocorrer uma les\u00e3o de pele, inicia-se um processo de cicatriza\u00e7\u00e3o que tem por objectivo \n\nrestabelecer as propriedades e fun\u00e7\u00f5es nativas da pele. Este processo \u00e9 complexo e envolve \n\nfases que incluem: Hemostase, Inflama\u00e7\u00e3o, Migra\u00e7\u00e3o celular, Prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o e Matura\u00e7\u00e3o. Com o \n\nintuito de restabelecer o mais rapidamente poss\u00edvel a estrutura e fun\u00e7\u00e3o da pele t\u00eam sido \n\nusados auto-, alo- e xeno- enxertos. At\u00e9 ao presente foram desenvolvidos um grande n\u00famero \n\nde substitutos de pele. No entanto, estas abordagens terap\u00eauticas apresentam algumas \n\nlimita\u00e7\u00f5es tais como, a rejei\u00e7\u00e3o por parte do paciente, risco de transmiss\u00e3o de doen\u00e7as e, \n\nainda uma disponibilidade limitada. Devido a este facto tem-se procurado desenvolver novos \n\nsubstitutos de pele que permitam acelerar o processo de cicatriza\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nNo presente estudo foi desenvolvido um novo substituto de pele, que consiste numa esponja \n\nrevestida. A esponja foi produzida por um processo de congela\u00e7\u00e3o/descongela\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nPosteriormente, esta foi revestida pelo m\u00e9todo de electrospinning com uma membrana fibrosa, \n\ncontendo um agente anti-inflamat\u00f3rio (Ibuprofeno). Os biomateriais escolhidos na produ\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nesponja revestida foram o Quitosano, Gelatina, PEO e PCL, que s\u00e3o conhecidos por possu\u00edrem \n\nas propriedades requeridas para serem aplicados na regenera\u00e7\u00e3o do tecido, como sejam, a \n\nbiocompatibilidade, a actividade antimicrobiana, degradabilidade, e ainda uma porosidade que \n\npermite a internaliza\u00e7\u00e3o e a prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas dentro da sua estrutura e ainda permitem \n\na difus\u00e3o de gases, nutrientes e produtos residuais. O Ibuprofeno foi ainda incorporado nas \n\nesponjas para reduzir a inflama\u00e7\u00e3o associada \u00e0 les\u00e3o. \n\nA estrutura dos biomateriais produzidos, foram analisadas por espectroscopia de infravermelho \n\ncom transformada de Fourier (FTIR). A morfologia da superf\u00edcie e do interior das esponjas foi \n\ncaracterizada por microscopia eletr\u00f3nica de varrimento (SEM). A ades\u00e3o celular e \n\ninternaliza\u00e7\u00e3o das c\u00e9lulas nas estruturas porosas foram visualizadas atrav\u00e9s de imagens de \n\nmicroscopia confocal. Os perfis citotoxidos dos biomateriais foram caracterizados por meio de \n\nensaios de viabilidade celular, e os resultados obtidos confirmaram a sua biocompatibilidade. \n\nA actividade antimicrobiana dos biomateriais foi tamb\u00e9m avaliada e os resultados mostraram \n\nque as esponjas inibem o crescimento na sua superf\u00edcie, do microrganismo mais comum das \n\n\n\nxi \n \n\ninfec\u00e7\u00f5es de pele (Staphylococcus aureus).

Introduction \n\n \n\nSkin is the largest organ of the human body and it plays highly specialized functions like at as \n\na protective barrier against external insults that comprise ultraviolet light radiation (1), \n\nchemicals and microorganisms. Skin is also involved in fluid homeostasis maintenance, \n\nthermoregulation, immune surveillance, sensory detection and self-healing (2). \n\nSkin injuries have a high impact on the life quality of patients. Skin injuries are caused by burns, \n\naccidents, diseases, surgery, trauma and bruises. Due to the various functions of the skin, any \n\nloss of skin integrity may result in organism disorders and ultimately in a significant patient \n\ndisability or even death (2, 3). Skin disruption often leads to an increase in fluid loss, infection, \n\nscarring, compromised immunity and change in body image (4). For a complete restoring of \n\nboth skin structure and function, successful wound healing must occur. The healing process of \n\nadult skin is complex, requiring the collaborative efforts of cells as well as both extracellular \n\nand intracellular signals (5, 6). With the objective to solve the problems associated with re-\n\nestablishment of the native structure of skin and also the mechanisms responsible for healing, \n\ndifferent wound dressings have been developed so for to protect the wound from bacterial \n\ninfection, dehydration and allow wound exudate absorption (6). Nowadays, skin substitutes \n\nhave a high demand for clinical uses. Actually, they represent approximately 50 % of Tissue \n\nEngineering (TE) and regenerative medicine market revenues.  \n\nTE is emerging as an interdisciplinary field in biomedical engineering that integrates many \n\nconcepts of science and engineering in order to design and develop biological substitutes that \n\nrestore, maintain or improve organs functions and damaged tissues regeneration (2, 7). It has \n\nappeared as a solution to the a number of clinical problems that were not properly treated by \n\nthe conventional therapeutics in which wound healing of chronic wounds is include (8). In a \n\nnear future, TE purposes to produce a biodegradable wound dressing that promotes the re-\n\nestablishment of skin\u2019s native structure (Epidermis, Dermis and skin appendages). Furthermore, \n\nthese skin substitutes are expected to reduce costs and pain associated with wound healing \n\n(Lanza et al., 2007). \n\n \n\n1.1 Skin \n\n1.1.1 Functions and structure \n\n \n\nSkin provides an essential protective barrier against external environment avoiding pathogens \n\ninvasion. Morever, this organ is also responsible for several hemostatic/sensory functions that \n\nare vital to health, namely the regulation of temperature and the hydration state for the human \n\nbody (9-11). In detail, the skin functions are: \n\n \n\n? Hydratation: Avoids patient dehydration; \n\n\n\n \n\n3 \n \n\n? Protection: Confers protection against harmful external agents (ultraviolet light, \n\nmechanical, chemical and thermal insults), and also disables microorganisms \n\npenetration; \n\n? Sensativity: Skin has various sensory receptors, that allow to monitoring of body \n\ntemperature, touch, pressure, vibration and pain; \n\n? Metabolic: Subcutaneous adipose tissue constitutes a major energy reserve, mainly in \n\nthe form of triglycerides. Epidermis is synthesizes vitamin D, which is responsible for \n\nthe maintenance of calcium and phosphorus concentration in the blood; \n\n? Thermoregulation: Body temperature regulation, in which hair and pores are present \n\nat the surface of the skin. \n\n \n\nSkin is organized in three anatomical distinct layers known as Epidermis, Dermis and \n\nHypodermis (Figure 1). Between Epidermis and Dermis is a Dermal\u2013epidermal junction (DEJ) \n\nthat provides mechanical support for the Epidermis and acts as a partial barrier against larger \n\nmolecules (10). \n\n \n\nFigure 1: Structure of the human skin. Adapted from (12). \n\n \n\nIn the three layers of skin there are skin appendages such as, nails, hair follicles, sweat and \n\nsebaceous glands, nerves, lymphatic and blood vessels (13, 14). \n\n \n\n1.1.1.1 Epidermis  \n\n\n\n \n\n4 \n \n\n \n\nEpidermis is the outermost layer of the skin, acting as a physical barrier against the external \n\nenvironment, preventing the water loss and infections (13). This layer is mainly constituted by \n\nkeratinocytes (80 % of cellular elements), pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) and \n\nspecialized dendritic Langerhans cells that have an essential role in the skin immune defense \n\nsystem (15, 16). \n\nThe Epidermis comprises 4-5 sublayers (17): stratum basale (SB), spinosum (SS), granulosum \n\n(SG), lucidum (SL) and corneum (SC), as can be observed Figure 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2: Representation of skin layered organization. Skin is composed of three layers: Epidermis, Dermis \n\nand Hypodermis. Epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium that is divided into four layers, starting \n\nwith the outermost layer: stratum corneum (SC), stratum granulosum (SG), stratum spinosum (SS), and \n\nstratum basale (SB). Adapted from (18). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n5 \n \n\nThe SB is comprised mostly by keratinocytes that are in constant division. They are responsible \n\nfor the continuous self-renewel of Epidermis. The SS also contains keratinocytes that are \n\ninvolved in the process of growth and early keratin synthesis (13, 14). The SG is characterized \n\nby the presence of intracellular granules that are involved in the process of keratinization (19-\n\n21). The SL represents 3\u20134 layers of dead and flat cells. This sub-layer is only found in the skin \n\nof palms and soles (13, 14). The final result of keratinocyte maturation is found in the SC (Figure \n\n2), which is formed by completely differentiated dead keratinocytes (corneocytes). The \n\nresulting structure provides the physical barrier and prevent water loss of the human skin (13, \n\n14, 22). \n\nThe Epidermis is bound tightly to the underlying Dermis through the basement membrane at \n\nthe DEJ. The basement membrane can be divided into lamina lucida (the layer closer to the \n\nEpidermis that is made of laminin, entactins and dystroglycans) and lamina densa (a sheet-like \n\nstructure composed mainly by collagen type IV). The whole basement membrane is involved in \n\nthe mechanical stabilization of the Epidermis (14, 23, 24). Moreover, the basement membrane \n\ndetermines the polarity of the Epidermis and provides a barrier against Epidermal migration, \n\nwhich prevents the direct contact of Epidermal cells with the Dermis (23, 24)  \n\n \n\n1.1.1.2 Dermis \n\n \n\nDermis lies below the Epidermis and constitutes the main part of the skin (13). Dermis is \n\ncomposed by a high number of fibroblast cells that produce collagen type I and III, elastin and \n\nglycosaminoglycans (GAGs). These proteins are the main constituents of the extracellular \n\nmatrix (ECM) and are responsible for the support and elasticity of the skin (14). Additionally, \n\nDermis confers support to the vascular and lymphatic vessels and nerve bundles (Figure 2) (17, \n\n25). \n\nDermis is divided in papillary and reticular layers. The superficial papillary Dermis is composed \n\nby thin fibers that are loosely arranged and contains blood vessels that supply the Epidermis \n\nwith nutrients, remove waste products and help in body temperature regulation. The deeper \n\nreticular Dermis accounts for 80 % of Dermis and is composed by dense collagen and elastic \n\nfiber matrix, conferring strength and flexibility to the skin (17, 24) \n\n \n\n1.1.1.3 Hypodermis \n\n \n\nThe Hypodermis, located below the Dermis, is also known by subcutaneous tissue, is mainly \n\ncomposed by fat and connective tissue (15, 16). This layer is highly vascularized, providing \n\nblood vessels and nerves to the skin and also allowing its connection to the underlying bones \n\nand muscles. Furthermore, it also contribute for the thermoregulatory and mechanical \n\nproperties of the skin (12, 16). \n\n \n\n1.1.1.4 Skin appendages \n\n\n\n \n\n6 \n \n\n \n\nSkin has a variety of appendages, like, sweat and sebaceous glands, hairs folicules, nails and \n\nnerves. The sweat glands, secrete a watery fluid onto the skin surface, by the process of \n\nexocrine secretion. These glands play on important role in the thermoregulatory mechanism in \n\nhumans (26). The main function of the sebaceous glands is to secrete sebum to moisturize the \n\nskin and hair and even the hair follicles, which are a source of proliferation of keratinocytes \n\nduring epithelialization. Hair follicles also play an important role in the wound healing, once \n\nthe Epidermal basal layer constitutes the outer cell layer of these structures and it has been \n\nshown that such basal cells, present in hair follicles, can move out and repopulate the Epidermis \n\nafter healing. Nails confer protection to the distal phalanx and the fingertip (14). Moreover, \n\nskin contains a variety of nerve endings that sense heat and cold, touch, pressure, vibration \n\nand tissue injury. All cutaneous nerves have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia, and \n\nboth myelinated and non-myelinated fibers are found. Free sensory nerve endings lie in the \n\nDermis where they detect pain, itch and temperature. Specialised corpuscular receptors also \n\nlie in the Dermis allowing sensations of touch (perceived by Meissner\u2019s corpuscles) pressure and \n\nvibration (by Pacinian corpuscles).  \n\n \n\n1.2 Skin wounds \n\n \n\nSkin wounds affect millions of people worldwide, being one of the major issues of modern \n\nhealth care (5, 27). According to the Wound Healing Society (WHS), a skin wound can be \n\ndescribed as a \u201cdisruption of normal anatomic structure and function\u201d of skin, resulting from \n\nphysical or thermal damage, medical procedures or physiological conditions (28). \n\nSkin wounds can be classified in acute or cronic: \n\n \n\nAcute wounds: \n\nAcute wounds are usually characterized by a complete healing, with a minimal scar \n\nformation. The primary causes of acute wounds include mechanical injuries due to external \n\nfactors, such as abrasions and tears that are caused by frictional contact between the skin and \n\nhard surfaces. Other examples of mechanical injuries include penetrating wounds caused by \n\nknives, gun shots or surgical procedures. Burns and chemical injuries (caused by radiation, \n\nelectricity, corrosive chemicals and thermal sources) are another category of acute wounds \n\n(28). Acute wounds heal through a normal, orderly, and timely reparative process that results \n\nin a sustained restoration of the anatomic and functional integrity of this organ (28, 29). \n\n \n\nChronic wounds: \n\nChronic wounds are characterized by their slow healing (28). These type of wounds are \n\ncommonly affected by several factors, such as the absence of clot formation (which reduce the \n\nlevels of active/vital growth factors in the wound environment) and bacterial colonization that \n\ntriggers a high immune response for removing the debris, leading to healing time (30, 31). \n\n\n\n \n\n7 \n \n\nChronic wounds usually occur in individuals who have underlying comorbidities, including \n\nperipheral blood vascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic steroid use, or other chronic \n\ndiseases that impair tissue healing (30, 32). These wounds involve a large surface area and have \n\na high incidence in general population, featuring an enormous medical and economic impact \n\n(33). Pressure, venous insufficiency, diabetic foot ulcers and ischemic wounds are the most \n\nprevalent types of chronic wounds (28, 33). \n\n \n\nAdditionally, skin wound can also be classified accordingly for the with the depth of injury and \n\nthe number of layers affected: superficial, superficial partial-thickness, deep partial-thickness \n\nand full-thickness wound (28, 34): \n\n \n\nSuperficial wound: \n\nResults from sunburns, light scalds and abrasions. In this type of wounds only the \n\nEpidermis is affected and they are characterized by erythema and minor pain. Such injuries do \n\nnot require specific surgical treatment, since it regenerates without scaring occurs (34). \n\n \n\nSuperficial partial-thickness wound:  \n\nAffects Epidermis and superficial parts of the Dermis. Epidermal blistering and severe \n\npain characterizes this type of injury, especially in the case of thermal trauma. The blood \n\nvessel, sweat glands and hair follicles are affected. The cells (keratinocytes) migrate towards \n\neach other from the basal layer to surround the wound. The healing occurs purely by \n\nepithelialization (28, 34). \n\n \n\nDeep partial-thickness wound:  \n\nInjuries that involve great Dermal damage take long period to heal. Scaring is more \n\npronounced for depth injuries, as well as the fibroplasia that is more intense, when compared \n\nwith superficial partial-thickness wounds (5, 34, 35). \n\n \n\nFull-thickness wound:  \n\nThis type of wounds are characterized by a complete destruction of the skin \n\nappendages. The healing process involves contraction, and the epithelialization process occurs \n\nonly from the edge of the wound. All full-thickness skin wounds are more than 1 cm in diameter \n\nand require skin grafting, as they cannot epithelialize on their own and may lead to extensive \n\nscarring, leading to limitations in joint mobility and severe cosmetic deformities for the patient \n\n(5, 34, 35). \n\n \n\n1.2.1 Skin burns \n\n \n\nSkin burns result from physical, chemical or thermal damages. The severity of the burn is \n\ndetermined by the patient condition (age and health) and it is usualy classified in degrees \n\n\n\n \n\n8 \n \n\ndepending on depth, position and size of the burned area (36, 37). Burns are usually divided in \n\nfour degrees (Figure 3) (38, 39): \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3: Representation of the different degrees (first, second, third and fourth) of skin burn severity. \n\nAdapted from (40). \n\n \n\nFirst-degree (or superficial):  \n\nBurns affect only the top layer of the skin and are the least severe burns. It involves \n\npain and edema formation. The skin usually takes several days to restore its structure, however \n\nthe formation of scar does not occur. The superficial burns are healed in a period of 2 weeks \n\n(34, 40). \n\n \n\nSecond-degree (or partial-thickness):  \n\nInvolves the Epidermis and part of the underlying Dermis destruction. Blisters are \n\ncharacteristic of in this type of burns (34, 40). \n\n \n\nThird-degree (or full-thickness):  \n\nAffect all layers of skin, including the nerves. In these type of burns, skin is restored \n\nfrom the periphery involving the formation of granulation tissue and also scarring. Usually, in \n\nthis type of burn the necrotic tissue resulting from the burn must be removed (34, 40). \n\n \n\nFourth-degree:  \n\nBurns extend into the muscle below the skin, including fat tissue, tendons, muscles and \n\nbones (40).  \n\n \n\n1.3 Wound healing \n\n \n\nAfter, a lesion, skin integrity and function must be restored. The main goals of healing is to \n\nachieve a rapid wound closure and a functional and aesthetic scar (41). Although, if skin \n\nregeneration does not occurs properly significant disability or even death may occur (2, 3). \n\n\n\n \n\n9 \n \n\nSkin wound healing is a complex process with an orchestrated cascade of events (e.g. \n\ncoagulation, inflammation, phagocytosis, chemotaxis, mitogenesis, epithelialization and ECM \n\nproteins production) (4, 42), where different cellular elements (e.g. platelets, neutrophils, \n\nmacrophages, keratinocytes and fibroblasts) and soluble factors (e.g. cytokines and growth \n\nfactors) are involved.  \n\nSkin healing process can be divided into four overlapping phases: (i) haemostasis, (ii) \n\ninflammation, (iii) cell migration and proliferation and (iv) remodeling (43) as displayed in \n\nFigure 4. \n\n \nFigure 4: Representation of the phases of the wound healing. This process involves diferente types of cells \n\nand various phases. Phase I - Haemostasis which is characterized by coagulation and platelet activation; \n\nPhase II - Inflammatory phase where the cells of the immune system are recruited to injury site; Phase III \n\n- Proliferation phase occur the formation of ECM, granulation tissue and also angiogenesis; Phase IV - \n\nRemodeling, where the formation and maturation of the scar occurs. \n\n \n\n1.3.1 Phases of wound healing \n\n1.3.1.1 Haemostasis \n\n \n\nAfter a tissue injury, the disruption of blood vessels is responsible for the extravasation of blood \n\nconstituents (5, 35, 44). Bleeding typically occurs when the skin is injured and it allows the \n\nremoval of bacteria and/or antigens from the wound. In addition, bleeding triggers platelet \n\naggregation, fibrin clot formation and activates the coagulation cascade in order to prevent \n\nongoing fluid losses. Haemostasis is achieved initially by the formation of a platelet plug, \n\n\n\n \n\n10 \n \n\nfollowed by the formation of a fibrin matrix that allows cells infiltration. The clot dries to form \n\na scab and provides strength and support to the injured tissue (Figure 5) (28, 45). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5: Representation of first phase of wound healing process: Haemostasis. The red balls represent \n\nthe platelets releasing several factors, including platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming \n\ngrowth factor ? (TGF-?). \n\n \n\nThe cytoplasm of platelets contains ?-granules filled with growth factors and cytokines, such \n\nas PDGF, TGF-?, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and insulin-like growth factors. They also \n\ncontain dense bodies that store vasoactive amines, like serotonin, which increase the \n\nmicrovascular permeability (35). There is an invasion of inflammatory cells such as leukocytes, \n\nmacrophages and neutrophils of the wound site. These cells and platelets release cytokines and \n\ngrowth factors in order to activate the inflammatory process (35). \n\n \n\n1.3.1.2 Inflammation \n\n \n\nThe inflammatory phase begins almost simultaneously with haemostasis, sometimes from within \n\na few minutes of injury to 24 hours, and lasts for about 3 days. This phase can be divided into \n\ntwo stages (early and late inflammatory phases) depending either on the time and duration of \n\nthe response and the type of inflammatory cells involved (35). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n11 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 6: Representation of early inflammatory phase. The red balls represent the platelets that release \n\nseveral factors, including PDGF and TGF-?, which attract PMNs to the wound, signalling the beginning of \n\ninflammation. The blue traces represents fibrin. \n\n \n\nIn the early inflammatory phase the activation of coagulation and complement system leads to \n\nthe release of chemoattractants that recruit neutrophils into the wound site (Figure 6) (46). \n\nThen, the degranulation of platelets occurs. Moreover, once at the wound site, neutrophils \n\nperform their function of killing and phagocyte bacteria and damaged matrix proteins within \n\nthe wound bed. The role that neutrophils play is crucial within the first days after injury, due \n\nto their ability to perform phagocytosis and also secrete proteases, that are involved in killing \n\nbacteria and also on degrade the necrotic tissue (42). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 7: Representation of late inflammatory phase. The yellow clots represents the aggregate of \n\nmacrophages with the PMNs, which are responsible for removing the debris from the wound, release \n\ngrowth factors and begin to reorganize the ECM. The red balls represent the platelets releasing several \n\nfactors, including PDGF and TGF-? and traces of fibrin. \n\n \n\nAfter 2-3 days in the late inflammatory phase, monocytes appear in the wound area and \n\ndifferentiate into macrophages (5). These macrophages are the most essential inflammatory \n\ncells involved in the normal healing response, as can be observed in Figure 7. Once activated \n\n\n\n \n\n12 \n \n\nthey perform phagocytosis of pathogens and of cell debris as well as the secretion of \n\nchemokines, inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor (TNF-?) that \n\nstimulate the re-epithelialization) and growth factors such as: EGF (that stimulates the re-\n\nepithelialization), TGF-?, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), PDGF (which promote cell \n\nproliferation and the synthesis of ECM molecules by resident skin cells) and vascular endothelial \n\ngrowth factor (VEGF) (that stimulates the angiogenesis and granulation) (5). Macrophages act \n\nas phagocytic cells and secrete growth factors that are responsible for the proliferation of \n\nendothelial and smooth muscle cells and also for the production of ECM components by \n\nfibroblasts. They also involved in the release of enzymes that help to debride the wound (42). \n\nThe presence of macrophages at the wound site is a marker that the inflammatory phase is \n\nfinishing and the proliferative phase is beginning. \n\n \n\n1.3.1.3 Cell migration and proliferation \n\n \n\nThe migration phase is the final stage of visible wound healing process (Figure 8). This phase \n\ninvolves the migration of keratinocytes, fibroblasts and endothelial cells to the wound site in \n\norder to replace the damaged tissue (47). In this phase, the wound is filled with granulation \n\ntissue. The endothelial cells of the adjacent venules initiate the angiogenesis process. These \n\ncells also synthesize remodelling enzymes that perform the breakdown of the ECM and thus \n\ncreate defects into which new capillary vessels will form a network and restore the vasculature \n\n(5, 28, 35, 39, 44). \n\nThe proliferative phase starts three days after injury and lasts for about 2 weeks (35, 47). It is \n\ncharacterized by fibroblasts cells migration and by the deposition of newly synthesized ECM \n\nand formation of granulation tissue (35, 48). With progression of the proliferative phase, the \n\nprovisional fibrin/fibronectin matrix is replaced by the newly formed granulation tissue (48). \n\nEpithelialization of the wound represents the final stage of the proliferative phase (35). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8: Representation of migration and proliferation phase. The proliferation phase begins when \n\nfibroblasts are recruited to the wound site through the release of growth factors by inflammatory cells. \n\nThen fibroblasts start the synthesis of collagen. \n\n\n\n \n\n13 \n \n\n \n\nMigration of fibroblasts:  \n\nFibroblasts appear at the wound site after 2\u20134 days and endothelial cells come about \n\none day later (5). Following injury, fibroblasts are attracted to the wound by a several growth \n\nfactors, including PDGF and TGF- ?. After that, fibroblasts proliferate and produce the matrix \n\nproteins: fibronectin, hyaluronan, collagen and proteoglycans. These components are involved \n\nin the production of a new ECM, which supports the migration and proliferation of cells (35, \n\n47). \n\n \n\nProduction of the new ECM:  \n\nThe ECM is composed by a network of structural proteins (collagens and elastin) and by \n\nan interstitial matrix composed by the adhesive glycoproteins (fibronectin, laminin and \n\nthrombospodin) embedded in a proteoglycan and GAGs (5, 49). In wound healing, PDGF, FGF, \n\nTGF-?, interleukin-1 (IL-1), TNF induce collagen synthesis during the proliferative and \n\nremodeling phases (35, 50). \n\n \n\nFormation of the granulation tissue:  \n\nAfter 3\u20135 days, the development of the granulation tissue occurs, which is characterized \n\nby a high density of fibroblasts, granulocytes, macrophages, capillaries and loosely organized  \n\ncollagen bundles (5, 35). Angiogenesis and neovascularization are also processes that occur in \n\nto this phase. (5, 35, 42, 49).  \n\n \n\nEpithelialization:  \n\nWithin a few hours often skin injury, a single layer of Epidermal cells migrate, from the \n\nwound edges, to form a covering over the damaged area. Along this process, a new basement \n\nmembrane is produced and, thereafter, the growth and differentiation of epithelial cells allows \n\nthe re-establishment of the stratified epithelium. At the end of this phase the myofibroblasts \n\nare responsible for wound contraction, bringing the edges together. The appearance of \n\nmyofibroblasts corresponds to the initiation of connective-tissue compaction and the \n\ncontraction of wound (5, 35). \n\n \n\n1.3.4 Remodelling (maturation) \n\n \n\nRemodelling is the last phase (Figure 9) of the wound healing and occurs from day 21 to up to \n\n1 year after injury. At this stage, the majority of endothelial cells, macrophages and \n\nmyofibroblasts undergo apoptosis or exit from the wound, leaving a mass that contains few \n\ncells and consists mainly of collagen and other ECM proteins (5). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n14 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 9: Representation of the remodeling phase. The green represents collagen and the purple \n\nfibroblasts. \n\n \n\nThis stage involves the formation of cellular connective tissue and strengthening of the new \n\nepithelium. There is a continuous synthesis and breakdown of collagen as well as the remodeling \n\nof ECM. Such determines the nature of the final scar (Enoch and Leaper, 2008). Most of the \n\nendothelial cells, macrophages and myofibroblasts undergo apoptosis or exit from the wound, \n\nleaving a mass that contains few cells and mostly collagen and other ECM proteins (42).  \n\nProbably, the interactions between the epithelial mesenchymal cells will remain to support the \n\nskin integrity and homeostasis. In addition, over 6\u201312 months, the collagen type III that was \n\nproduced in the proliferative phase is now replaced by collagen type I. This process is performed \n\nby matrix metalloproteinases secreted by fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells (5). \n\nFinally, the angiogenic response decreases, the wound blood flow decreases and the acute \n\nwound metabolic activity slow down and stop. Subepidermal appendages such as hair follicles \n\nor sweat glands are not re-established after a serious injury (5, 42, 51). \n\n \n\n1.3.2 Types of wound healing \n\n \n\nIn each healing process there are several mechanisms involved. The severity of the wound, \n\nnumber of skin layers affected and the occurrence or absence of bacterial infection allows us \n\nto classify the wound healing in different categories (5, 35): \n\n \n\nPrimary healing:  \n\nOccurs when a wound, created by laceration or surgical incision, causes only focal \n\ndisruption of the continuity of the epithelial basement membrane and death of some cells of \n\nthe underlying connective tissue. The wound is closed within 12-24 hours of its occurrence; In \n\nthis type of healing, epithelial regeneration predominates over fibrosis (35, 44). \n\n \n\nDelayed primary healing:  \n\n\n\n \n\n15 \n \n\nOccurs in a contaminated or poorly delineated wound. The closure is performed after \n\nthe host defenses have helped to debride. After 3-4 days, phagocytic and inflammatory cells \n\nare recruited to the wound site to remove the contaminating bacteria. Collagen metabolism is \n\nusually unaffected and the wound retains its tensile strength (35, 44). \n\n \n\nSecondary healing:  \n\nOccurs when the wound edges cannot be approximated, due to the extensive loss of \n\nsoft tissue, caused by a major trauma like severe burns and some surgical procedures. This type \n\nof wound healing is common in patients with underlying co-morbidities such as vascular, \n\ndiabetic and pressure ulcers. The wound is left open and thus more susceptible to infections. \n\nThe epithelial cells are not capable to restore the skin original architecture, so there is ingrowth \n\nof granulation tissue from the wound margins, followed by accumulation of ECM with the laying \n\ndown of collagen. Myofibroblasts, which have structural properties similar to that of fibroblast \n\nand smooth muscle cells, are thought to play a crucial role in the healing of this type of injuries. \n\nThe secondary healing is slower and may lead to functional defects (35, 44). \n\n \n\nSuperficial healing:  \n\nIt is observed in injuries such as superficial burns, split-thickness donor graft sites, and \n\nabrasions where the injury involves the epithelium and the superficial (papillary) part of the \n\ndermis. The basal layer of cells remains uninjured and the epithelial cells within the Dermal \n\nappendages, hair follicles, and sebaceous glands replicate to cover the exposed Dermis; the \n\ncells migrate towards each other from the basal layer to surround the wound. Healing occurs \n\npurely by epithelialization (35). \n\n \n\n1.4 Tissue engineering \n\n \n\nTE is a field that applies the principles of biology, engineering and medicine in order to develop \n\nthe biological substitutes that restore, maintain or improve damaged tissues or organs functions \n\n(2). It appeared as a solution for a number of clinical problems that were not properly treated \n\nwith the use of permanent replacement devices (8).  \n\nThe underlying concept of TE is to isolate cells from a patient and then produced to their \n\nexpansion and incorporation in a 3D matrix. The resulting TE construct is then grafted back into \n\nthe same patient to function as a replacement tissue. In this approach, a highly porous artificial \n\nECM, or scaffold, is required to accommodate mammalian cells and guide their growth in three \n\ndimensions. \n\nMajor advances in materials science and engineering have contributed for the continuous \n\ndevelopment of TE and regenerative medicine (7, 52, 53). Nowadays, the tissue engennering is \n\na discipline already applied in a significant number of medical procedures for skin (54), liver \n\n(55), pancreas (56), intestines (57), esophagus (58), nerves (59), cartilage (60), bone (61), and \n\ntendon (62) replacement. \n\n\n\n \n\n16 \n \n\n \n\n1.4.1 Tissue engineering applied to wound healing \n\n \n\nAutografts, allografts and xenografts are the most used therapeutic approachs for skin \n\nregeneration. Autografts are obtained from the patient and present a higher healing success \n\nrate. However, they have a limited supply and its obtention is associated to morbidity in the \n\ndonor site (63, 64). Allograft skin is harvested from organisms of the same specie. The use of \n\nallograft skin is limited since there is a great risk of disease transmission, eventual immune \n\nrejection and other limitatiors associated with its storage (65). The demand for tissues and \n\norgans seriously exceeds the supply, creating a substantial waiting list. Moreover, the immune \n\nsystem tends to reject the foreign tissue or organ (14). Xenograft skin is harvested from a \n\ndifferent species and the majority of xenograft tissues are rejected by the immune response of \n\nthe host, that may be caused upon the implantation process, thus leading to a high failure rate \n\n(66-68). \n\nIn order to overcome the drawbacks associated with the use autografts, allografts and \n\nxenografts, different studies have been performed in the area of TE to developed new skin \n\nsubstitutes that can contribute to reduce the mortality and morbidity caused by scarring, \n\nchanges in pigmentation, reduce the number of surgical procedures and hospitalization period \n\n(69).  \n\nIn the development of materials aimed to produce new skin substitutes it is necessary to take \n\ninto account three major requirements: the safety of the patient, the clinical efficacy and the \n\nconvenience of handling and application. Nowadays, skin substitutes are highly porous and some \n\nof them can accommodate skin cells and guide their growth in three dimensions (70). \n\n \n\n1.4.1.1 Comercial available skin substitutes  \n\n \n\nDifferent skin substitutes are already applied in the clinic. Skin substitutes are a heterogeneous \n\ngroup of wound coverage materials that aid in wound closure and help in the reestablishment \n\nof the functions of the skin (28, 71, 72). Most of the bioengineered skin devices currently \n\navailable consist on a combination of sheets of biomaterial matrix (e.g. collagen, hyaluronic \n\nacid) containing cultured cells (73-75). Several types of temporary dressings have been designed \n\nto provide a bacterial barrier to decrease pain and contribute to an adequate environment for \n\nepithelial regeneration.  \n\nWound dressings have been widely used due to their relative low cost, ease use, and \n\neffectiveness to clean and protect the wound from the external environment. They act as \n\nphysical barriers that protect the wound from microorganism invasion and promote moisture \n\nenvironment and allow gases exchanges. \n\nThe commercial bioengineered skin equivalent products are classified accordingly to the \n\nfollowing parameters (2, 74-76):  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n17 \n \n\nA. Type of the biomaterial used for their production:  \n\na. Biological \u2013 e.g. Epicel; \n\nb. Synthetic \u2013 e.g. MySkin. \n\n \n\nB. Composition regarding the cellular components:  \n\na. Cellular \u2013 e.g. Dermagraft; \n\nb. Acellular \u2013 e.g. Integra Dermal regeneration. \n\n \n\nC. Duration: \n\na. Temporary \u2013 e.g. Dermagraft; \n\nb. Semi-permanent \u2013 e.g. Integra Dermal regeneration; \n\nc. Permanent \u2013 e.g. Epicel. \n\n \n\nD. Layer of skin that skin substitutes are able to replace: \n\nEpidermal substitutes - keratinocytes are isolated from a donor and then are cultured \n\nin vitro in order to obtain the necessary number of keratinocytes for therapeutic \n\npurposes. Several Epidermal skin substitutes are already commercially available: \n\n \n\na) Epicel \u2122: is a permanent substitute, which is composed by the in vitro culture \n\nof autologous keratinocytes (confluent cellular sheets) (34, 77). \n\n \n\nb) EpiDex \u2122: in vitro cultured autologous keratinocytes collected from hair bulbs \n\n(confluent cellular sheets). It is a permanent substitute (17, 77). \n\n \n\nc) MySkin \u2122: in vitro cultured autologous keratinocytes (subconfluent cellular \n\nsheets) which are grown on a silicone support layer with a specially formulated \n\nsurface coating (34, 77). \n\n \n\nDermal substitutes - Dermal substitutes are usually acellular, based on allogeneic, \n\nxenogeneic or synthetic materials (78). Dermal skin replacements present advantages, \n\nsuch as reduced costs, easier manufacture and rigorous quality control. They also add \n\nmechanical stability and prevent the wound from contracting (2, 34). However, they \n\ncan be rejected by the host and be involved in diseases transmission (15). The Dermal \n\nsubstitutes available in include: \n\n \n\na) Dermagraft \u2122: is composed of polyglactin mesh seeded with living cultured \n\nneonatal fibroblasts. It is a temporary substitute (79). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n18 \n \n\nb) Alloderm is a freeze-dried human acellular dermal matrix. This type of matrix \n\nis ready to be incorporated into the wound, and it does not any immunogenic \n\nresponse from the host due to absence of a cellular component (80); \n\n \n\nc) Integra\u00ae: is composed by two layers: a porous layer of the skin made of bovine \n\ncollagen type I and shark chondroitin-6-sulphate GAG that is bonded to a \n\nsilicone pseudo-epidermis Integra\u00ae. It is indicated for the treatment of full \n\nthickness or deep partial thickness burns (17, 81). \n\n \n\nDermo-epidermal substitutes - These substitutes mimic the Epidermal and Dermal \n\nlayers. These substitutes are more advanced than the Epidermal and Dermal ones, \n\nalthough they are the most expensive (82).  \n\n \n\na) Apligraf \u2122: is composed by viable allogeneic neonatal fibroblasts grown in a \n\nbovine collagen type I gel matrix, combined with  viable allogeneic neonatal \n\nkeratinocytes. It supplies ECM components to the wound, as well as cytokines \n\nand growth factors (77, 81). \n\n \n\nb) PermaDerm \u2122: is composed by an Allogenic matrix with bovine collagen. It is a \n\npermanent substitute (77). \n\n \n\nc) OrCell \u2122: is a TE skin construct that includes cultured allogenic fibroblasts and \n\nkeratinocytes from the same neonatal foreskin. Fibroblasts are seeded into a \n\nbovine type I collagen sponge (77).  \n\n \n\n1.5 Polymeric sponges for skin regeneration \n\n \n\nDespite the existence of various skin substitutes, none of them is capable of completely \n\nreplicate the anatomy, physiology, biological stability or aesthetic nature of native skin (15).  \n\nIn addition, they are expensive, require frequent replacement, making the patient susceptible \n\nto subsequent secondary bacterial infections. Having this knowledge in mind, there is a huge \n\ndemand for developing alternative strategies for treating burns or other skin lesions. \n\nResearchers from the area of TE have develop new Dermis and Epidermis substitutes using \n\nnatural or synthetic matrices (83), in order to promote a more rapid and improved healing as \n\nwell as a reduced scarring (2). \n\nBased on the properties that skin substitutes must have, porous scaffolds emerged as a \n\npromising alternative to be used as skin substitutes.  \n\nSponges are three-dimensional (3D) matrices that act as temporary templates for cell adhesion \n\nand proliferation, while providing mechanical support, until the new skin tissue is formed at \n\n\n\n \n\n19 \n \n\nthe affected area. Polymeric sponges are potential scaffolds for skin regeneration since they \n\nsatisfy several requirements (84, 85): \n\na) Protect the wound from fluid and proteins loss; \n\nb) Easy to handle and apply at the wound site; \n\nc) Present controlled degradation; \n\nd) Enable exudates absorption; \n\ne) Minimize scar formation; \n\nf) Large surface area that enables cell adhesion, growth and differenciation; \n\ng) Great porosity that allows cell infiltration, diffusion of nutirents and gases exchange; \n\nh) A surface can be easily modified (e.g. with the use of coatings); \n\ni) Can be produced using various techniques; \n\nj) Biocompatible: ability of a biomaterial to perform its desired function, without eliciting \n\nany undesirable local or systemic effects in the recipient or beneficiary of that therapy \n\n(10); \n\nk) Biodegradable: The by-products of their degradation must be non-toxic and able to exit \n\nfrom the body without interference with other organs. In order to allow degradation at \n\na rate compatible with tissue formation, an inflammatory response combined with \n\ncontrolled infusion of cells such as macrophages is required; \n\nl) Active biomoluces (e.g. growth factors, cell-surface interactive peptides, drugs) can \n\nbe easily incorporated to the sponge matrix that will facilitate skin regeneration, to \n\nstimulate cellular attachment, migration and proliferation. \n\nBased on these properties the development of sponges for skin regeneration may have a huge \n\npotential for skin healing. \n\n \n\n1.5.1 Methods and techniques used for sponge production \n\n \n\nDifferents methods have been used for the development of sponges for TE, including the \n\nsupercritical fluid technology, porogen leaching, freeze drying, scaffold templating (see Table \n\n1, for further details). \n\n \n\nSupercritical fluid technology: \n\nIn this process, high pressures are used to dissolve the polymeric solution with or \n\nwithout a porogen. When a supercritical fluid such as carbon dioxide is used as a nonsolvent, \n\nthe simple tuning of the processing conditions (pressure and temperature) can tailor the final \n\nstructure of the sponges. Also, any subsequent drying step is avoided, as the obtained porous \n\nstructure is a dry product free of any residual solvent (86, 87).  \n\n \n\nPorogen leaching: \n\n\n\n \n\n20 \n \n\nPorogen leaching allows the control of pore size and porosity of sponges, allowing the \n\nobtention of scaffolds with a more homogeneous pore morphology (86). Porous structures from \n\npolymers such as PCL has been produced using this method (88). \n\n \n\nFreeze drying: \n\nThe method is based on the formation of ice crystals that induce porosity through ice \n\nsublimation and desorption. The kinetics of the freezing stage controls the porosity and the \n\ninterconnectivity of the foams (89). 3D structures with values of porosity up to 200 % (86) with \n\ndifferent interconnectivities are commonly obtained by freeze-drying. The main difficulty \n\nassociated with this process is to ensure structural stability and adequate mechanical properties \n\nof the porous constructs after subsequent hydration. This limitation hinders its use when the \n\napplication involves conditions with mechanical stress, even at low-to-moderate levels. \n\n \n\nScaffold templating techniques: \n\nPolymeric solutions may be injected into moulds to fabricate scaffolds with various \n\nshapes and sizes. Also, the mould template can be design to fabricate a macroporous scaffold \n\n(86). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n21 \n \n\nTable 1: Technologies used for the production of 3D constructs. Adapted from (86). \n\n \n\n \n\n1.5.2 Coating of sponges \n\n \n\nElectrospinning has been recognized as the simplest technique to produce continuous \n\nnanofibers from diverse materials, including polymers (90).  \n\nElectrospinning is a process that comprise the application of a needle attached to a syringe \n\nfilled with polymer solution, a grounded collector plate and a high voltage power supply \n\nconnected between the capillary and the collector. The feeding rate of the polymer solution is \n\nusually controlled using a syringe pump. A charged polymer solution flowing out of the needle \n\nis accelerated towards the grounded collector by a strong electrostatic field (91, 92). This field \n\ncauses the droplet to emerge from the needle to undergo deformation into a conical shape, \n\nknown as the \u201cTaylor cone\u201d. When a critical value is attained (the repulsive electrostatic force \n\novercomes the surface tension) a fine jet of the solution emerges from the Taylor cone. The \n\njet undergoes twisting instability and a characteristic whipping motion due to the charge-\n\ncharge repulsion that occurs between the excess charges presented in the jet (Figure 10), and \n\nduring this phase, the jet is drawn by at least two orders of magnitude, the solvent evaporates, \n\nand the dry fibers deposit onto the collector (91, 92). \n\nThe properties of the nanofiber mesh depending on fiber diameter, porosity characteristics of \n\nthe solution and electrospinning equipment processing parameters. The smaller size of the \n\nindividual fibers, the higher the surface area to volume ratios, which leads to an increase cell \n\nproliferation (93). The size, shape, individual fibers, the porosity of the web of fibers obtained \n\nand chemical compositions can be easily manipulated (94).  \n\n \n\nFabrication \n\ntechnology \n\nProcessing Pore size (\u00b5m) Porosity (%) Advantage Disadvantage \n\nSupercritical fluid \n\ntechnology \n\nCasting.&lt;50 and&lt;450&lt;95 - - \n\nPorogen leaching Casting. 30\u2013300 20\u201350 3D scaffold.

Adapted from (25). \n\n \n\nIn biomedical applications the ultrafine fibrous scaffolds produced by electrospinning have been \n\ndemonstrated to have suitable properties to promote the adhesion, proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation of several types of cells (94). \n\nMoreover, electrospun fibers can be used to coat scaffolds aimed for tissue regeneration, \n\nnamely skin regeneration. Several electrospun nanofibrous membranes a contribution of \n\nnatural/synthetic materials have been already tested for skin regeneration, produced with \n\nnatural materials or polymers. Electrospun nanofibers reproduce the native topographical \n\nfeatures of the natural ECM, promoting the cell\u2019s natural functions (95, 96). \n\nMost of the work performed in this field uses biodegradable synthetic polymers (such as PCL) \n\nto produce non-woven membranes for various TE or drug delivery applications (97). \n\nCurrently, a variety of natural polymeric-based membranes obtained from Chitin (98), Chitosan \n\n(99, 100), Alginate (100), Cellulose (101, 102), Hyaluronic acid (103), Gelatin (104, 105), \n\nCollagen (106) and their derivatives have been developed in order to satisfy the hight demand \n\nfor new materials for the treatment of different wounds. These types of membranes may be \n\ncomposed of dense top layer and underlying porous sponge-like layer. The external layer \n\nprotects the wound and serves as an artificial Epidermis, while the inner layer is designed for \n\nthe drainage of wound exudates and attachment of wound tissues (107, 108). \n\n \n\n1.5.3 Biomaterials used for sponges production \n\n \n\nThe first issue with regard to the development of a scaffold for skin TE is the choice of suitable \n\nmaterial. Natural polymers can mimic many features of ECM and thus can guide the migration, \n\ngrowth and organization of cells during the wound healing process (109, 110).  \n\nThese natural polymers include polysaccharides, like Chitosan or proteins-based polymers \n\n(Collagen, Fibrin gels, Silk, and Gelatin). Despite their low mechanical strength, these natural \n\n\n\n \n\n23 \n \n\npolymers have high hydrophilicity, low immune reaction and promote cell adhesion and \n\nproliferation (111).  \n\n \n\n1.5.3.1 Chitosan \n\n \n\nChitosan is a cationic polysaccharide composed of copolymers of ? (1?4)-glucosamine and N-\n\nacetyl-D-glucosamine (Figure 11). It presents important characteristics for biomedical \n\napplications, such as, biocompatibility, biodegradability, hydrophilicity, hemostatic activity, \n\nnonantigenicity, anti-microbial activity and promote wound healing (108, 112). In addition, \n\nChitosan is very abundant, has a low production cost and is environmental friendly. \n\nChitosan has been applied in the area of TE for a wide variety of applications, like skin \n\nregeneration. It induces a faster wound healing and produce smoother scarring possibly due to \n\nan enhanced vascularization (113).  \n\nAnother important property of Chitosan is its antibacterial activity for different strains, such \n\nas Enterobacter aerogenes, Salmonellas Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia \n\ncoli (84, 114, 115). Due to this bactericidal activity Chitosan has been blended with other \n\npolymers (71, 116). Its antimicrobial activity may result from the electrostatic interactions \n\nbetween the positively charged Chitosan with negatively charged molecules at the cell surface, \n\nwhich affects cell permeability (71). This electrostatic attraction promotes cells\u2019 adhesion, \n\nproliferation and differentiation (116, 117). \n\nDifferent studies reported the use of Chitosan for the production of skin substitutes, due to its \n\nproperties that stimulate haemostasis and fibroblast to synthetize collagen, improving the \n\ntissue regeneration (118, 119). In vivo, this polymer stimulates the adhesion of fibroblasts, \n\npromoting keratinocytes proliferation and modulate the migration of neutrophils and \n\nmacrophages, which in turn, modifies the repairing processes such as fibroplasias and \n\nreepithelialisation (66, 71). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n24 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 11: Chemical structure of Chitosan. Adapted from (120, 121). \n\n \n\nThe deacetylation degree (DD) of commercial available Chitosan is usually between 70 % and \n\n95 %. The different DD are defined in terms of the percentage of primary amino groups in the \n\npolymeric matrix (122). Chitosan with higher DD presents a greater number of free amino groups \n\n(71). Chitosan is degraded in vivo, through enzymatic hydrolysis. Lysozyme is the primary \n\nenzyme responsible for the in vivo degradation of Chitosan. \n\n \n\n1.5.3.2 Gelatin \n\n \n\nGelatin is produced by partial hydrolysis of collagen extracted from the boiled bones, \n\nconnective tissues, organs and some intestines of animals. Gelatin is colorless, brittle (when \n\ndry) and a flavorless solid substance. It is commonly used as a gelling agent in food and \n\npharmaceuticals. Gelatin is biodegradable, biocompatible and has low antigenicity (122). \n\nAlthough, it obtained from collagen, it still retains some its properties, such as tripeptide Arg-\n\nGly-Asp (RGD) sequence, that promote cell adhesion, differentiation and proliferation (123). \n\nFurthermor it also has a low cost and low immunogenicity. It is soluble at physiological pH and \n\nat 40 \u00b0C. The large number of amino, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, allows Gelatin chemical \n\nmodification, increasing its versatility (Figure 12). Gelatin has been investigated for the \n\nproduction of matrices for skin regeneration (sponge or film) that can promote the \n\nepithelialization and granulation tissue formation (124). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n25 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 12: Representation of Gelatin structure. Adapted from (125). \n\n \n\n1.5.3.3 Poly (ethylene oxide) \n\n \n\nPEO is a unique class of water-soluble biodegradable biopolymer (Figure 13). Due to its \n\nexcellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and potential to be used in biomedical applications \n\nhas attracted a great attention from both the industrial and scientific areas (113, 126). PEO is \n\nalso used to reduce the viscosity of Chitosan solution, so that the solution is extruded at high \n\npolymer concentrations. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 13: Structure chemical of PEO. \n\n \n\n1.5.3.4 Poly (?-caprolactone) \n\n \n\nPCL (Figure 14) is a polyester that exhibits good mechanical properties. It a semi-crystalline \n\nmaterial. However, due to its hydrophobic character, contains very few cell recognition sites \n\nand has a slow degradation rate. This polymer is used for various biomedical applications such \n\nas sutures, drug delivery systems and scaffolds in TE, due to its soft- and hard-tissue compatible \n\nproperties (72). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n26 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 14: Structure chemical of PCL. \n\n \n\n1.5.4. Incorporation of anti-inflammatory drugs in sponges for skin \n\nregeneration \n\n \n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly used drugs to treat \n\ninflammatory diseases, since they are effective in the management of pain, fever, redness, \n\nedema that occur as a consequence of inflammatory mediator release (127, 128). Different \n\nstudies have shown that both therapeutic and side effects of NSAIDs are dependent of \n\ncyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition. COX isoforms have been named constitutive cyclooxygenase-\n\n1 (COX-1) and inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). COX-1 (such as indomethacin, naproxen, \n\nIbuprofen) catalyzes the formation of cytoprotective prostaglandins in thrombocytes, vascular \n\nendothelium, stomach mucosa, kidneys, pancreas, langerhans islets, seminal vesicles and brain \n\n(128, 129). Induction of COX-2 by various growth factors, proinflammatory agents, endotoxins, \n\nmitogens and tumor agentes (130, 131) indicates that this isoform may have a role in occurence \n\nof pathological processes, such as inflammation (132, 133). As a result of studies focused on \n\nreduction of the adverse effects of NSAIDs, selective COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib and \n\nrofecoxib, have been developed. Today, it is a well-known hypothesis in medicine that COX-1 \n\nis constitutive and cytoprotective, while COX-2 is an inducible enzyme in the inflamed tissues \n\n(Figure 15). \n\n\n\n \n\n27 \n \n\n \nFigure 15: Mechanism of action of the COX-1 and COX-2 in the human body. \n\n \n\nNSAID in general in particular Ibuprofen, have been shown to have benefic effects on various \n\nacute conditions ranging from sepsis, traumatic induced pulmonary damage and wound healing.  \n\n \n\n1.5.4.1 Action of Ibuprofen in the wound healing process \n\n \n\nIbuprofen has been shown to have benefic effects on acute episodes of a wide range of tissues. \n\nIbuprofen was the first phenylpropionate to be marketed in the United States. It has analgesic, \n\nantipyretic and anti-inflammatory activity and it is well absorbed and well tolerated (134, 135). \n\nIbuprofen has also been shown to improve several aspects of the wound healing ranging from \n\nwound edema. As previously described in literature the second degree burn wounds treated \n\nwith Ibuprofen 5 % from two and five hours after burn showed a significantly reduced lymph \n\ndrainage and no variation in the wound water content (136). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n28 \n \n\n1.6 Main goals of the present study \n\n \n\nIn this study new skin substitutes were aimed to be produced. The objectives of the workplan \n\ncomprised: \n\n \n\n1) Production of Chitosan-Gelatin sponge using freeze-dried method; \n\n2) Coating of sponges with nanofibers produced with Chitosan deacetylation, PEO, PCL \n\nand Ibuprofen); \n\n3) Morphological and physicochemical characterization of the bilayer of the S; \n\n4) Evaluation of biocompatibility of the developed system; \n\n5) Evaluation of the antibacterial properties of the produced S. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n29 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter II- Materials and Methods \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n30 \n \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\n2.1 Materials \n\n \n\nThe cell culture plates and T-flasks used in this study were obtained from Orange Scientific \n\n(Brainel\u2019 Alleud, Belgium). Cell imaging plates were purchased from Ibidi GmbH (Munich, \n\nGermany). Lysozyme (46 400 U/mg) and 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-\n\ntetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany). Ibuprofen \n\nwas purchased from TCI (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Co., LTD., Japan). Chitosan (medium \n\nmolecular weight (MMW) 190,000-310,000 g.mol-1) and (low molecular weight (LMW) 50.000-\n\n190.000 g.mol-1), Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM-F12), Gelatin, glutaraldehyde, \n\nkanamycin, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), streptomycin, tripolyphosphate (TPP), trypsin, PEO and \n\nPCL, amphotericin B, Ethanol (EtOH), paraformaldehyde (PFA) and trypan blue were purchased \n\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich (Sintra, Portugal). Acetic acid was acquired to Pronalab (Barcelona, Spain). \n\nNormal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) criopreserved cells were purchased from PromoCell \n\n(Labclinics, S.A.; Barcelona, Spain). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in the clinic. Fetal \n\nbovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Biochrom AG (Berlin, Germany). LB Broth was obtained \n\nfrom Liofilchem (Via Scozia, Italy). Propidium Iodide (PI) was purchased from Invitrogen \n\n(Carlsbad, USA). \n\n \n\n2.2 Methods \n\n2.2.1 Sponge production \n\n \n\nS were produced through freeze-drying, as preiously described elsewhere (137). First, MMW \n\nChitosan 2 % (w/v) was dissolved in a solution of 1 % (v/v) acetic acid and 4 % (w/v) Gelatin was \n\nsolubilized a Mili-Q water. The samples were stirred for 24 hours at 50 \u00baC to obtain a \n\nhomogenized solution. Following this, the solution was placed in cylindrical mold and taken to \n\n-80 \u00baC, for 14 hours and then lyophilized (Scanvac CoolSafe\u2122, ScanLaf A/S, Denmark) for 24 \n\nhours. The lyophilized structures were recovered from the molds and crosslinked with TPP 2 % \n\n(w/v) for 4 hours at room temperature (RT). After that, the cycle of freezing and freeze-drying \n\nwas repeated. \n\n \n\n2.2.2 Production of membrane and coated sponge \n\n2.2.2.1 Deacetylation of Chitosan \n\n \n\nThe LMW Chitosan was deacetylated and further purified in order to improve the surface \n\ncharges to increase its possible the interaction with cells (113). Subsequently, Chitosan was \n\ndissolved in a NaOH solution. 500 mg of Chitosan was mixed with 10 mL of NaOH (1 M). After \n\nthat, the mixture was heated at 50\u00b0C, under magnetic stirring for 4 hours and then filtered \n\n\n\n \n\n31 \n \n\nthrough a 0.44 ?m filter in a Buchner funnel. The remaining material was washed extensively \n\nuntil the pH was equal to that of ultrapure water. Finally, the samples were dried at 40\u00b0C \n\novernight (138). \n\nIn order to determine the DD, the recovered deacetylated Chitosan was dissolved in acetic acid \n\n(1 M). The solution was then filtered with a 0.22 ?m filter to remove any solid particles. \n\nSubsequently, the pH was adjusted to 7 with NaOH (1 M). The product was then centrifuged \n\nthree times at 4500 rpm (Sigma 3K18C centrifuge) and finally the recovered pellet was freeze-\n\ndried for 24 hours. The DD was measured by determining the first derivative of UV-vis spectrum \n\n(139). \n\n \n\n2.2.2.2 Electrospinning setup \n\n \n\nThe system used to produce the M and CS was composed by a high power voltage supply \n\n(Spellman CZE1000R, 0\u201330 kV), a syringe pump (KDS-100), a syringe fitted with a stainless steel \n\nblunt end needle and an aluminum plate connected to a conductive collector. The needle was \n\npositively charged by the power supply and the metal collector was grounded. The charged tip \n\nand grounded collector form a static electric field between them, to provide the driving force \n\nthat enables fiber formation (91, 140). \n\n \n\n2.2.2.3 Production of Chitosan/PEO/PCL/Ibuprofen electrospun membrane \n\n \n\nTwo solutions were prepared separately: (i) 1.2 g of deacetylated Chitosan (obtained as \n\npreviously described in section 2.2.2.1) was dissolved in 90 % acetic acid and 0.25 g of PEO; and \n\n(ii) 1 g of PCL and 0.16 mg/mL of Ibuprofen was dissolved in pure acetone. Then these to \n\nsolutions (Chitosan/PEO and PCL/Ibuprofen) were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v) under stirring \n\nuntil a homogenized solution was obtained. Then Ibuprofen at a final concentration of 0.8 \n\nmg/ml was added to the mixture. \n\nThe previously prepared solutions were placed in a 10 ml plastic syringe. The solution flow rate \n\nwas set to 1-2 ml/hour. The electric voltage applied was 20-25 kV and the ground collector was \n\nat 10 cm from tip of the syringe needle. All experiments were conducted at ambient pressure \n\nand relative humidity of 15-20 % (141). \n\n \n\n2.2.3 Characterization of the physicochemicals properties of sponge, \n\nmembrane and coated sponge \n\n2.2.3.1 Scanning electron microscopic analysis \n\n \n\nThe morphologies of S, M and CS were characterized by SEM. The samples were frozen using \n\nliquid nitrogen and freeze-dried for 3 hours. Subsequently, they were mounted on aluminum \n\nstumps, coated with gold using a Quorum Q150R ES sputter coater. Then, samples were \n\n\n\n \n\n32 \n \n\nanalyzed using a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope operated at an accelerating \n\nvoltage of 20 kV and at different magnifications. \n\n \n\n2.2.3.2 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic spectroscopy analysis \n\n \n\nFTIR analysis is extensively applied for identify the chemical structure of samples (S, M and CS) \n\nby comparing their spectra with the spectra of the materials used for their production (Quitosan \n\nLMW and MMW, Gelatin, TPP, PEO, PCL and Ibuprofen). In this technique, the radiation crosses \n\nthe sample and some of it is absorbed, while other part is transmitted. The resulting spectra \n\nrepresent the frequency of vibration between the atoms linkage from the sample, creating \n\ntherefore, a specific spectra for those interactions (142). The FTIR spectra of the samples were \n\nacquired with a spectrophotometer Nicoletis 20 (64 scans, at a range of 4000 to 1000cm?1) from \n\nThermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with a Smart Itr auxiliary. \n\n \n\n2.2.3.3 Contact angle determination \n\n \n\nContact angles of the surface of S, M and CS were determined using a data physics contact \n\nangle system OCAH 200 apparatus, operating in static mode. For each sample, water drops were \n\nplaced at various locations of the materials surface at RT. The reported contact angles are the \n\naverage of at least three measurements (143). \n\n \n\n2.2.3.4 Swelling studies \n\n \n\nThe water uptake capacity of the samples (S, M, CS) were determined using a sample \n\ngravimetric method (144). Samples were weighted and incubated in falcons with 5 mL of \n\nsolution phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) at 37 \u00baC, and at pH 5.5 and pH 7.4. At \n\npredetermined intervals, the samples were recovered from PBS solution and weighed. Then \n\nthey were re-immersed into the swelling medium. After, the swelling ratio percentages were \n\ndetermined using the following equation: \n\n \n\nSwelling ratio (%) =\nweight ? initial weight\n\ninitial weight\n\u00d7 100     (1) \n\n \n\n2.2.3.5 Porosity evaluation \n\n \n\nThe total porosity of the samples (S, M and CS) was determined by adapting a displacement \n\nmethod (145). The total amount of ethanol (100 %) that the samples were able to absorb in 4 \n\nhours, was used to determine the porosity of the samples using the following equation: \n\n \n\nPorosity (%) =\nweight swollen sponge ? initial weight\n\ndensity etanol ? volume sponge\n\u00d7 100     (2) \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n33 \n \n\n2.2.4 Characterization of sponges and coated sponges through in vitro \n\nassays \n\n2.2.4.1 In vitro degradation assays \n\n \n\nS and CS samples (n=3) were incubated in 10 mL of PBS with or without lysozyme (10 mg/L). \n\nSamples were maintained at 37 \u00baC for 21 days (144). After 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days samples were \n\nremoved, rinsed twice with distilled water and dried on the lyophilizer. After, samples were \n\nweighted in order to determine the percentage of weight loss, through equation: \n\n \n\nWeight loss (%) =\ninicial weight ? final weight\n\ninitial weight\n\u00d7 100       (3) \n\n \n\nFor complementar analysis, SEM images were also acquired to characterize the morphology and \n\nporosity of the samples for each degradation period. \n\n \n\n2.2.4.2 Proliferation analysis of NHDF cells in contact with samples \n\n \n\nNHDF cells were seeded in T-flasks of 25 cm2 with 6 mL of DMEM-F12 supplemented with heat-\n\ninactivated 10 % FBS (v/v) and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic solution. Hereafter, cells were kept \n\nin culture at 37 \u00b0C in a 5 % dioxide carbon (CO2) humidified atmosphere, inside an incubator \n\n(146). When cell confluence was achieved, cells were sub cultivated by 3-5 minutes incubation \n\nin 0.18 % trypsin (1:250) and 5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Then, cells were \n\ncentrifuged, resuspended in culture medium and then seeded in T-flasks of 75 cm2 and \n\nmaintained in culture using the same conditions.  \n\nTo evaluate cell viability in the presence of the samples (S, M and CS) herein produced, each \n\nsample were added (n=5) into a 96-well cell culture plates. Previously to cell seeding samples \n\nwere sterilized by UV exposure for at least 30 min. \n\nNHDF cells were seeded at a density of 2x104 cells per well in 96-well plates containing the \n\nsamples (S, M and CS). Cells where maintained in DMEM-F12 supplemented with heat-\n\ninactivated 10 % FBS (v/v). Hereafter, cells were kept in culture at 37 \u00b0C, in a 5 % CO2 \n\nhumidified atmosphere, inside an incubator (146). After 24, 48 and 72 hours of cells being in \n\ncontact with samples (S, M and CS) were monitored by Olympus CX41 inverted light microscope \n\n(Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus SP-500 UZ digital camera (143, 146) was used to \n\nmonitor cellular growth. \n\nThe biocompatibility of the samples was also evaluated, after cells being in contact with the \n\nsamples during for 24, 48 and 72 hours, through an MTT assay was performed. Briefly, the \n\nculture medium of each well was removed and replaced with a mixture of 100 ?L of fresh \n\nmedium and 20 ?L of MTT reagent solution. After a period of 4 hours of MTT incubation at 37 \n\n\u00b0C, under a 5 % CO2 humidified atmosphere, the medium was aspirate leaving just the formazan \n\ncrystals. These crystals were dissolved with 200 \u00b5L Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) using on orbital \n\n\n\n \n\n34 \n \n\nshaker. After, the absorbance of the produced formazan was measured at 570 nm using a \n\nmicroplate reader (BIO-RAD xMark TM Microplate Spectrophotometer) (147). Wells containing \n\ncells in the culture medium without any sample were used as negative control. 70% EtOH was \n\nadded to other wells containing cells which and were used as positive control (66). \n\n \n\n2.2.4.3 Scanning electron microscopic analysis of cells adhesion \n\n \n\nCells adhesion of the S, M and CS were analysed by SEM. After 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture, \n\nsamples with cells were recovered and washed in PBS. Then, samples were emerged in 2.5 % \n\n(v/v) glutaraldehyde at 4\u00baC to fix cells (144). Samples were then frozen using liquid nitrogen \n\nand freeze-dried for 3 hours. Subsequently, samples were mounted on aluminum stumps, \n\ncoated with gold using an Quorum Q150R ES sputter coater (137). Lastly, samples were analyzed \n\nusing a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of \n\n20 kV and at different magnifications. \n\n \n\n2.2.4.4 Confocal microscopic analysis of the sponge and coated sponge \n\n \n\nCLSM was used to evaluate the ability of cells to become internalize in the samples. For the \n\nvisualization of NHDF cells within samples (S and CS), 1\u00d7104 cells/well were seeded in ?-Slide 8 \n\nwell Ibidi imaging plates (Ibidi GmbH, Germany) in contact with samples. After 24 hours, cells \n\nwere fixed with 4 % PFA for 20 min. After, cells were stained with 1 ?L of PI (1 mg/mL) during \n\n15 min, at 37 \u00baC. Then, the PI solution was washed and the samples were washed three times \n\nwith PBS. Imaging experiments were performed in a Zeiss LSM 710 CLSM (Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., \n\nUSA), where consecutive z-stacks were acquired. 3D reconstruction and image analysis was \n\nperformed in Zeiss Zen 2010 (143). \n\n \n\n2.2.5. Incorporation of Ibuprofen in sponges \n\n2.2.5.1 IC50 determination of the Ibuprofen in NHDF cells  \n\n \n\nTo determine IC50 of Ibuprofen for NHDF cells, cells were initially seeded at a density of 2x104 \n\ncells/well in a 96-well cell culure plates, containing DMEM-F12 supplemented with 10 % FBS \n\n(v/v). Adherent cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C, in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere \n\ncontaining 5 % CO2. In the following day, culture medium was replaced and cells were incubated \n\nwith crescent concentrations of Ibuprofen (0.25, 0.50, 0.70, 0.75, 0.80 and 0.90 mg/mL). Wells \n\ncontaining cells in the culture medium without Ibuprofen were used as negative control. EtOH \n\n70 % was added to wells containing cells that were used as positive control.  \n\n \n\n2.2.5.2 Characterization of the Ibuprofen release profile \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n35 \n \n\nThe release studies were performed in order to evaluate the rate of drug release from the \n\nsamples. First, 10 mL of PBS was added to a falcon, at 37\u00ba C, pH=7.4. Afterwards, 1 mL of the \n\nsamples were periodically taken along 50 hours and substituted by equal amount of PBS. Spectra \n\nof the recovered samples were acquired using a UV-1700 PharmaSpec spectrophotometer from \n\nShimadzu (Kyoto, Japan) and analyzed with an UVProbe Shimadzu 2.0 software. The absorbance \n\nof various samples concentrations of Ibuprofen in PBS was determined at 264 nm. A drug \n\ncalibration curve was performed usind various concentrations of Ibuprofen (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, \n\n0.5 mg/mL), and determining their absorvance at 264 nm.  \n\n \n\n2.2.5.3 Characterization of the cytotoxic profile of the samples loaded with \n\nIbuprofen \n\n \n\nThe Ibuprofen cytotoxic profile was characterized by means of in vitro assays. The MTT assay \n\n(described in detail in topic 2.2.4.2) was performed to further evaluate the cytotoxicity of this \n\ndrug. The absorbance of the produced formazan was measured at 570 nm using a microplate \n\nreader (BIO-RAD xMark TM Microplate Spectrophotometer) (147). Wells containing cells in the \n\nculture medium without any sample were used as negative control. 70 % EtOH was added to \n\nwells containing cells, that were used as positive control. \n\n \n\n2.2.6 Sponge and coated sponge antimicrobial activity \n\n \n\nTo evaluate the antimicrobial effect of the S and CS, Staphyloccocus aureus was used as a \n\nmodel of Gram-positive bacteria usually present in skin injuries. The bacterial culture medium \n\n(LB Broth) was inoculated with Staphyloccocus aureus at a concentration of 1x108 colony-\n\nforming units (CFU)/ml. A negative control was prepared without samples and a positive control \n\nwas prepared with addition of the Kanamycin antibiotic (2\u00b5L). Then, 2 ml of inoculum were \n\nadded to an agar petri dish using scattering method. Samples (S and CS) were previously \n\nsterilized with UV for 30 minutes, and then placed on the plates. The plate was incubated 24 \n\nhours at 37 \u00baC. After incubation, the halos that resulted from the inhibitory effect of S and CS \n\nwere observed macroscopicaly. After the bacterial assay, materials were removed from the \n\nagar plate and fixed in glutaraldehyde overnight. They were subsequently frozen in liquid \n\nnitrogen (-180 \u00b0C), lyophilized and analysed by SEM. The inhibitory halo was measured using an \n\nimage analysis software\u2014ImageJ (148) . \n\n \n\n2.2.7 Statistical analysis of the results \n\n \n\nStatistical analysis of the obteined results were performed, using one-way ANOVA with the \n\nDunnet\u2019s post hoc test and Newman- Keuls multiple comparison test. Each result is the mean \u00b1 \n\nstandard error of the mean of at least three independent experiments (82)  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter III -Results and Discussion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n37 \n \n\n3. Results and Discussion \n\n3.1 Characterization of the properties of sponge, membrane and \n\ncoated sponge \n\n \n\nThe Chitosan is known by its antitumoral, antifungal and antimicrobial activity (149). \n\nFurthermore, Chitosan and its derivatives are also known by their capacity to improve the \n\nwound healing process by enhancing the functions of inflammatory cells such as macrophages. \n\nChitosan can also increase the tensile strength of wounds (150).  \n\nFor skin regeneration, the antimicrobial activity of Chitosan against different microorganisms \n\nis very important. There are two main mechanisms associated with inhibition of microbial cells \n\nby Chitosan (151). The interaction of Chitosan with the anionic groups on the cell surface that \n\ncauses the formation of an impermeable layer around the cell that prevents the transport of \n\nessential solutes. \n\nChitosan degree of deacetylation (DD) and Molecular weight (MW), have also influence on its \n\nantimicrobial activity, hydrophilicity, degradation and cell response (152). The number of free \n\namino groups increases with the DD and these groups are able to interact with the membrane. \n\nIt was reported that Chitosan with relatively high DD 89 % strongly stimulated fibroblast \n\nproliferation, while samples with lower DD showed a lower cellular growth. \n\nTaking these facts into account it is fundamental that 3D constructs be built with Chitosan with \n\nLMW and a high DD. In this work LMW Chitosan was further deacetylated. The DD of the \n\ncommercial LMW Chitosan is defined as the percentage of primary amine groups in the Chitosan \n\nstructure. Chitosan DD can be controlled by processing the polymer with an alkaline treatment \n\n(e.g. NaOH) (153). This allows the interaction between Chitosan and cells, stimulating their \n\nadhesion and proliferation and also improving its antimicrobial and haemostatic activities, thus \n\nenhancing Tissue Regeneration (71, 122). The results obtained herein demonstrate that the \n\npercentage of DD Chitosan obtained was around 96 % (Table 2), which is higher than that of the \n\ncommercial one (153). \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n38 \n \n\nTable 2: DD of the commercial LMW Chitosan and of the deacetilated Chitosan produced herein (mean \u00b1 \n\nSD, n=3). The nominal DD was provided by the manufacturer. The DDs were determined by the first \n\nderivation of the UV-VIS spectrum of Chitosan. \n\nSample Nominal DD (%) Determined DD (%) \n\nComercial LMW Chitosan 75-85 90.02 \u00b1 1.87 \n\nDeacetilated Chitosan - 95.88 \u00b1 1.19 \n\n \n\n \n\n3.2 Morphologic characterization of the samples \n\n3.2.1 Membrane morphology \n\n \n\nThe M consisting of Chitosan, PEO and PCL was produced by electrospinning. Macroscopically it \n\nis possible to observe that the M is formed by a homogenous and dense structure of fibers \n\n(Figure 16 A1). A more detailed analysis through SEM image of the M reveals its dense 3D \n\nnanofiber network comprised by randomly arranged fibers, which results in an interconnected \n\nporous structure (Figure 16 A2). This 3D organization creates a large contact area with \n\nanchoring points for cell-nanofiber interactions enhancing cell adhesion, migration and \n\nproliferation (154). The porous nature is beneficial for cellular infiltration and proliferation \n\n(155). Additionally, porosity also ensures a correct gas, nutrient and fluids exchanges, processes \n\nthat are fundamental for obtaining hemostasis and proper wound healing (155). \n\n \n\n \nFigure 16: Macroscopic (A1) and SEM images (A2) of the M. Graphical representation of fiber diameter \n\nranges (B) from 142 measures by using Image J. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n39 \n \n\nThe distribution of the fibers diameter was measured using the image processing program Image \n\nJ (148). The most common fiber diameter was around 0.3 and 0.4 \u00b5m (Figure 16 B). Although \n\nit is important to achieve M mostly constituted by nanofibers with few hundred nanomaters of \n\ndiameter, once it is described that the reduction of the diameter of the fibers leads to an \n\nincreased cell adhesion and proliferation (156). The fiber diameter is also an importante feature \n\nthat influence the release of bioactive molecules (93) through diffusion (93). \n\n \n\n3.2.2 Sponges and coated sponges morphology \n\n \n\nThe sponges produced in this work were obtained by a freeze-drying method, where the \n\nformation of ice crystals improved the porosity of the samples (Liapis et al., 1996). In Figure \n\n17 it is possible to observe that the design S and CS have a porous and interconnected 3D \n\nstructure. In SEM images, demonstrate that the CS is perfectly covered by the nanofibers (Figure \n\n17 B c), and d)). The S and CS possess continuous interconnected pores up to 400-500 \u00b5m of \n\ndiameter. Pore size is an important condition for skin regeneration. If pores are too small, cells \n\nwill cover the pores, influencing cell migration and inhibiting neovascularization. On the other \n\nhand, if they are too large a decrease in cellular adhesion can occur. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17: (A) Macroscopic and microscopic images of S. (B) Macroscopic images and microscopic images \n\nof CS. \n\n \n\nFor better characterize the porosity of the samples, liquid displacement method using ethanol \n\nwas also performed (Figure 18).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n40 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 18: Determination of the porosity of S, M and CS. Where ** represents p<0.001 and **** p<0.0001. \n\n \n\nAccordingly to SEM images, S presented the highest value of porosity 51.60 % \u00b1 2.45, when \n\ncompared with the CS 39.00 % \u00b1 0.37 and M 1.50 % \u00b1 0.17. However even CS has a good \n\npercentage porosity for cell migration, adhesion, proliferation and also the diffusion of \n\nnutrients, oxygen and waste products, leading to an improved wound healing (143). \n\nThe Chitosan/Gelatin sponges obtained by the freeze-drying method are highly porous, allowing \n\nthe unhindered diffusion of solutes and nutrients. Also, the interconnectivity between the pores \n\nprovides more space and surface area-to-volume ratio for cell growth and local angiogenesis \n\n(146). Pores also promote fluids drainage, which is fundamental to prevent the build-up of \n\nexudates (66). \n\n \n\n3.3 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis of the sponge, \n\nmembrane and coated sponge \n\n \n\nIn infrared spectroscopy the radiation crosses the sample and some of it is absorbed, while \n\nother part is transmitted. The resulting spectra represent the frequency of vibration between \n\nthe atoms linkage from the sample, creating therefore, a specific spectra for those interactions \n\n(142). The FTIR analysis of the freeze-dryed sponges was performed to characterize the \n\nchemical composition of the different samples (Figure 19).  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n41 \n \n\n \nFigure 19: FTIR spectra of the produced S (A), M (B) and CS (C) and respective constituents: Quitosan \n\nMMW, Quitosan deacetylated LMW, Gelatin, TPP (Tripolyphosphate), poly (ethylene oxide (PEO)), poly (?-\n\ncaprolactone) (PCL) and Ibuprofen. \n\n \n\nThe characteristic peaks of TPP, Gelatin and MMW Chitosan are observed in the S (Figure 19 A). \n\nIn previous studies it was reported that the MMW Chitosan present characteristics peak at 1640 \n\ncm-1 (C=O stretch in primary amide) and 1546 cm-1 (N-H stretch in primary amine) (157). The \n\nother characteristic peak is observed at 3266 cm-1, that confirms the presence of Chitosan \n\nowing to the N-H group stretching in the polysaccharide, as referred by Bhat and collaborators \n\n(158). Gelatin present bands at 3284 cm-1 (N-H in amines), 1633 cm-1 (C=O stretch in primary \n\namide) and 1531 cm-1 (N-H deformation in secondary amides).  \n\nThe spectrum of the LMW deacetylated Chitosan (Figure 19 B) shows a variation in the \n\nwavelength of the peak from 1546 to 1433 cm-1, indicating that the secondary amide (\u2014NH\u2014R) \n\nhas been further changed to primary amide (\u2014NH2) by alkaline deacetylation (157). The process \n\nof deacetylation of Chitosan was achieved, leading to and increase in the number of amine \n\ngroups at its surface. The electrostatic interaction between the positive charges of the amine \n\ngroups of Chitosan and negative charges of phospholipids of cell membrane is more efficient.  \n\nThe nanofiber present in M (Figure 19 B), show characteristic PCL peak at 1723 cm-1, and the \n\nC-H stretching region of FTIR spectrum, the higher intensity peak at 2936 cm-1. PEO presents \n\nthe characteristics peaks at 2875 cm-1 in the C-H stretching. \n\nIn relation to CS, all its characteristic peaks are present in the spectrum (Figure 19 C). Also, it \n\nis possible to observe the representative peaks of the Ibuprofen, being the most characteristic \n\nthe ones present at 2870 and 2727 cm-1 highlighted by the C-H stretching vibrations peaks that \n\n\n\n \n\n42 \n \n\ncorrespond to the alkyl groups of Ibuprofen. The sharp peak at 1702 cm-1 belongs to a carboxyl \n\nvibration, that is characteristic of Ibuprofen (159). \n\n \n\n3.4 Contact angle of the sponge, membrane and coated sponge \n\n \n\nThe determination of contact angle is important to verify the hydrophobicity of the samples, \n\nsince it interferes with cellular behaviour and then influence the tissue regeneration. It is \n\nknown that hydrophilicity improves Tissue Regeneration by allowing cell migration, adhesion, \n\nproliferation and also the diffusion of nutrients (143). \n\nThe contact angle is defined as the angle formed by the intersection of the liquid-solid interface \n\nand the liquid-vapor interface (geometrically acquired by applying a tangent line from the \n\ncontact point along the liquid-vapor interface in the droplet profile). Small contact angles 90\u00b0 \n\ncorrespond to high wettability, while large contact angles correspond to low wettability i.e. \n\nhydrophobic character. Since PCL is a hydrophobic compound, its application will confer a \n\nhydrophobic character to M, that showed, contact angle 96.24\u00ba \u00b1 4.70. The S and CS are both \n\nhydrophilic, having contact angles of 71.14 \u00ba \u00b1 2.55 and 45.64 \u00ba \u00b1 6.08, respectively (Table 3).  \n\n \n\nTable 3: Contact angles determined for the produced samples. \n\nMaterials Water contact angle \n\nS 71.14\u00ba \u00b1 2.55 \u00ba \n\nM 96.24\u00ba \u00b1 4.70\u00ba \n\nCS 45.64\u00ba \u00b1 6.08\u00ba \n\n \n\nThe sponge coating confers a more hydrophilic character to CS and improved cell adhesion and \n\nproliferation, wich are fundamental for skin regeneration. \n\n \n\n3.6 Characterization of swelling profile of the sponge, membrane and coated \n\nsponge \n\n \n\nPolimeric biomaterials tend to absorb fluids due to osmotic pressure in order to fill the void \n\nregions of the polymeric network and within the beads that remained dehydrated, until they \n\nreach the equilibrium state. The water uptake causes an increase in the pore diameters \n\nallowing a subsequent diffusion of cells, nutrients, bioactive molecules and waste products \n\nthrough the biomaterials, which is for essential in skin regeneration. Also, the swelling profile \n\nof the samples are fundamental for the wound cleaning and allowing exudates removal. \n\nThe swelling studies are important to notice that the solvent used for the assay must have \n\nsimilar properties to that the fluids present in skin wounds. Therefore, the swelling test was \n\nconducted by immersing materials in PBS at pH 7.4 and 5.5. \n\n\n\n \n\n43 \n \n\nThe swelling degree is dependent on the pore size of samples and on the polymer-solvent \n\ninteractions (160-162). S and CS have a very porous structure, as a consequence, these sponges \n\nhad higher percentages of sweeling ratio, between 800-1000 % in both the CS (Figure 22) and \n\nin S (Figure 20). It is noteworthy that at pH 7.4 the swelling was always higher whereof pH 5.5. \n\nSuch swelling behaviour can be explained by the presence of hydrophilic groups in Chitosan and \n\nGelatin, such as hydroxyl, amino and carboxyl groups that can be easily hydrated (31, 163). \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 20: Swelling profile of the produced S (A) and close-up of the first 250 minutes (B). The swelling \n\nstudies were carried out at pH 7.4 (shown in blue) and pH 5.5 (shown in orange). \n\n\n\n \n\n44 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 21: Swelling profile of the produced M (A) and a close-up of the first 400 minutes (B). The swelling \n\nstudies were carried out at pH 7.4 (shown in blue) and pH 5.5 (shown in orange). \n\n\n\n \n\n45 \n \n\n \nFigure 22: Swelling profile of the produced CS (A) and a close-up of the first 250 minutes (B). The swelling \n\nstudies were carried out at pH 7.4 (shown in blue) and pH 5.5 (shown in orange). \n\n \n\nThe M swelling profile percentage is very low (Figure 21) in accordance with its hydrophobic \n\nconstituition (PCL) and low degree of porosity. Such may be responsible for the lower swelling \n\nratio percentage of CS in relation to S. The swelling percentage of CS is approximately 800 % \n\n(86, 164). Such result may be explained through the lower porosity of CS, since it is coated with \n\nPCL. \n\n \n\n3.7 In vitro degradation of the sponge and coated sponge \n\n \n\nWhile occurs the formation of a new tissue it is also important to ensure that materials are \n\ndegradaded in order to allow cell growth.  \n\nTo study the degradability of the biomaterials produced, their degradation studies. In these \n\nprofile was studied in vitro, sponges were immersed in a saline solution with enzymes that are \n\ninvolved in the degradation of the biomaterials that constitute the 3D construct. The \n\ndetermination of weight loss allow to characterize materials degradation profile. The \n\ndegradation study was performed with PBS and PBS plus Lysozyme (enzyme present in human \n\n\n\n \n\n46 \n \n\nbody that is responsible for Chitosan degradation). In Figure 23 A and 24 A are represented the \n\ndegradation over time of the S and CS in solution of PBS and PBS plus Lysozyme.  \n\n \n\n \nFigure 23: Charactherization of the degradation profile of S. SEM images (A) and weight loss along time \n\n(B). The tests were performed during 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days, in PBS and PBS plus Lysozyme. The pH of \n\nthe solutions was set to 7.4. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n47 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 24: Characterization of the degradation profile of CS. SEM images (A), and graph representation \n\n(B). The tests were performed during 1, 4, 7, 14 and 21 days in solutions of PBS and PBS plus Lysozyme. \n\nThe pH was set to 7.4. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 23 B and 24 B, it was noticed that after 24 hours both samples (S and CS) had a weight \n\nloss of about 50 % in PBS and Lysozyme. Nevertheless, as expected in the presence of Lysozyme \n\nthe degradation degree was higher (Figure 23 B and 24 B). In conclusion, it can be concluded \n\nthat sponges, suffer a high degree of degradation when immersed in the lysozyme solution.  \n\n \n\n3.8 Evaluation of cellular viability and cell proliferation in contact with \n\nsponge, membrane and coated sponge \n\n \n\nAs already previous described above it is very important to produce biocompatible materials. \n\nThe biocompatibility of a biomaterial is important since it should be capable of elicit an \n\nappropriate response for a specific application, and also do not trigger on, inflammatory or \n\ntoxic reaction when in contact with a live tissue or body fluids. The cellular viability of NHDF \n\nin contact with the produced sponges was quantitatively measured at 24, 48 and 72 hours using \n\nan MTT assay. The values of absorbances obtained for formazan are directly proportional the \n\nnumber of viable cells. \n\nFibroblasts cells were chosen, due to their potential for skin regeneration, since they \n\nsynthetized ECM proteins (e.g. collagen and fibronectin), cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-?) and \n\ngrowths factors that are essential for the wound healing process (42).  \n\n\n\n \n\n48 \n \n\nThe results of the MTT assay (Figure 25) show that the produced sponges are biocompatible, \n\ndisplaying a higher cell viability than the positive control (k+), however lower than negative \n\ncontrol (k-). The cellular viability is higher than 70 % wich is in accordance with the during \n\nrequirements of ISO 10993 (165).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 25: Characterization of cell viability in the presence of the produced materials.

Characterization of cells adhesion and penetration within produced \n\nsamples \n\n \n\nSEM analysis was also performed, to further characterize the cell adhesion and proliferation at \n\nthe surface of the S, M and CS (Figure 26). Filopoidia was observed at 48 and 72 hours in the \n\nsurface of the produced materials (Figure 26).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 26: SEM images of NHDF in contact with S, M, and CS after 24, 48 and 72 hours. Arrows indicate \n\ncells at the surface of the materials. \n\n \n\nThe interaction between cells and sponges is mediated by integrins, which recognize specific \n\nmotifs at materials surface like RGD sequences of Gelatin.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n50 \n \n\n \nFigure 27: Characterization of cellular internalization in different sponges. The blue color represented \n\nChitosan because it emits fluorescence and the red points are represent cells that were labeled with PI. \n\nScale bar: 200 \u00b5m. \n\n \n\nCLSM allows the acquisition of high-resolution optical images. The principle behind CLSM is to \n\nuse a focused laser beam through a sample and then collect the reflected or emitted light from \n\nthe sample, while removing any light originated from the outside of the focal point of the laser \n\nbeam. The CLSM can collect images of individual slices using fluorescence or reflection from a \n\nsample in the xy, xz and yz planes (166). Through the analysis of CLSM images obtained (Figure \n\n27) it was concluded that cells penetrate into sponges, as described in the topic 2.2.4.4.  \n\n \n\n3.10 Determination of the concentration of Ibuprofen that must be used to \n\nimprove wound healing \n\n \n\nThe IC50 of a drug is the minimum concentration that is able to kill half of the population of \n\ncells (167). Therefore, the IC50 of Ibuprofen was determined in order to know the concentration \n\nof drug that could be used without killing 50 % the cells. Figure 28 A shows that the 50 % viable \n\ncells is around 0.75 to 0.80 mg/mL of the Ibuprofen. Therefore the IC50 of Ibuprofen was \n\ndetermined (Figure 28 B). Experimental IC50 was calculated through the fitting a the \n\nexperimental data and a value of 819.58 \u00b1 2.42 \u00b5g/mL, was determined by Origin software. \n\nShould be noted that R2 0.99 and Chi2 0.5 values obtained in this IC50 curve fit provide a high \n\nconfidence in the obtained results. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n51 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 28: Evaluation of the cellular viability in contact of Ibuprofen (A). Determination of the IC50 of \n\nIbuprofen in contact with NHDF. Blue curve represents the mathematical fitting performed for IC50 \n\ncalculation. n=5. \n\n \n\n3.11 Determination of the release profile of Ibuprofen from coated sponge \n\n \n\nThe porous sponges produced herein can be used as a drug delivery system from which drugs \n\nare released by diffusion along time (168). In order to verify if the amount of drug released is \n\ntoxic for cells, the release profile of Ibuprofen was studied. The assay involved the collecting \n\nof dipping solutions that were in contact with CS and maintained at 37 \u00b0 C, pH 7.4, at 5, 10, \n\n24, 28, 30, 46 and 50 hours. Its absorbance was determined at 264 nm in order to characterize \n\nthe release profile of Ibuprofen (169). The calibration curve of Ibuprofen was performed using \n\ndifferent concentrations (Figure 29). During the 50 hours only about 20 % of Ibuprofen loaded \n\nin sponges was released, suggesting that the drug remained trapped in the fibers (Figure 30). \n\n \n\nFigure 29: Representation of the calibration curves of Ibuprofen where different concentrations of the \n\ndrug were used. Absorbance was determined at 264 nm. \n\n\n\n \n\n52 \n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 30: Characterization of the release profile of Ibuprofen. Absorbance was determined at 264 nm. \n\n \n\n3.12 Determination of the cellular viability in contact with coated sponges \n\nloaded with Ibuprofen \n\n \n\nFigure 31: Determination of the cellular viability in contact with Ibuprofen loaded on S, M and CS. The \n\nnegative control (K-)(live cells); positive control (K+) (dead cells). \n\n \n\nThe results obtained revealed that 65-75 % of cells remaned viable after 72 hours, when they \n\nwere in contact with materials loaded with Ibuprofen (Figure 31). Taking into account the IC50 \n\nof Ibuprofen that was previously determined (Figure 28 B), a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL of \n\nIbuprofen was incorporated in each of the sponges. However, due to the obtained results, it is \n\nnecessary to use a lower Ibuprofen concentration to increase cellular viability when cells are \n\nin contact with sponges. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n53 \n \n\n3.13 Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the sponge and coated sponge \n\n \n\nThe antibacterial properties of the materials produced here were evaluated using, \n\nStaphylococcus aureus as model bacteria (Figure 32). This bacteria is considered appropriate \n\nto test the antibacterial properties of the sponges, since it is the most common pathogen found \n\nin skin infections. \n\n \n\nFigure 32: Evaluation of the antimicrobial properties of the produced sponges. Macroscopic images of the \n\nS and CS show the formation of an inhibitory halo (A and B); SEM images show that nobiofilm was formed \n\non sponge surface (C and D); The negative control (Staphylococcus aureus grown in agar plate)) in present \n\nin (E).  \n\n \n\nIn order to assess biofilm formation on the surface of the material, SEM images were also \n\nacquired (Figure 32 C and 32 D). In the case of the S it can be observed that the formation of \n\nan inhibition zone (Figure 32 A). Regarding CS can also observe the formation of an inhibitory \n\nhalo was also observed (Figure 32 B), however the diameter of the halo is relatively greater \n\nthen that of S. For both materials no biofilm formation was observed on their surface on the \n\nsurface. The S and CS produced here showed in skin regeneration. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter IV- Conclusion \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n55 \n \n\n4. Conclusion \n\n \n\nWound healing is a major worldwide health problem that particularly affects the elderly and \n\ndiabetic population. In recent years, different therapeutic approaches have been proposed for \n\nimproving the wound healing process. Among the different dressings developed so far, sponges \n\nthat mimic the ECM have emerged as platforms that can trigger specific cellular responses at \n\nthe molecular level. These wound dressings not only provide a favourable 3D microenvironment \n\nfor cell adhesion and proliferation, but also allows gas, nutrients and waste products diffusion. \n\nFurthermore, these 3D matrices also confer protection to the wound from possible secondary \n\nbacterial infection. \n\nIn this study, non-toxic, highly porous and with antibactericidal activity sponges were produced \n\nusing a mixture of two biocompatible natural polysaccharides (Chitosan (MMW) and Gelatin). \n\nSponges were also coated with a nanofibrous membrane. This coating was intended to increase \n\ncontact surfaces of the material in order to increase cell interaction with sponges and also \n\nreproduce layers of skin. \n\nThe obtained results revealed that S and CS promote the formation of a consistent 3D structure \n\nthat supports cell adhesion and proliferation. In addition, SEM and CLSM analysis of sponges \n\nseeded with NHDF cells showed that cells were able to adhere and proliferate which is \n\nfundamental for a more rapid healing process be obtained. \n\nCell viability was evaluated through a MTT assay and the results confirm that the cells remain \n\nviable in contact with the sponges. Moreover, their antimicrobial activity was also assessed by \n\nthe formation of inhibitory halos and of biofilm on the surface of the sponges. Thus, it can be \n\nconcluded that, based on our in vitro studies, the sponges are biocompatible and that they have \n\nproperties that are compatible with their application as a wound dressings. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nChapter V- Bibliography \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n \n\n57 \n \n\n1.
