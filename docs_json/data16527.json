Classification of the RS coastline according to its state of human-induced alteration, \ndegree, and position of urban development, and presence of man-made forested areas. The \nnorthern sector (from Torres to Dunas Altas) consists mainly in highly developed and altered \nshores, while central (from Dunas Altas to the Patos Lagoon inlet) and southern sectors (south of \nthe Patos Lagoon inlet) are mainly undeveloped and preserved beaches. \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 18 \n\nFigure 2.3. Pictures show examples of beachfront development in RS beaches. (a) Praia da \nGuarita (Torres) show the rocky headlands observed in the northernmost coastal sector (Class 1). \n(b) Single-family beachfront properties placed behind the dunes are the dominant type of \nurbanized shores in RS (Class 3). (c) Hard engineering structures are observed protecting houses \nbuilt on top of the dunes mainly in the south of the northern sector (photo) and in Hermenegildo \n(Class 3). (d) An increasing problem has been small and wooden shacks built illegally on dune \nareas, as observed in Pinhal (Class 3). (e) Cap\u00e3o da Canoa represents the highly urbanized \nbeaches of the area between Cap\u00e3o Novo and Tramanda\u00ed in the northern sector (Class 3). (f) \nArmored beachfront houses built on top of dunes in Hermenegildo have been threatened by wave \nattack and storm surges during storms (Class 3). (g) Undeveloped open sandy beaches dominate \nalong 76% of the state shoreline (Class 4). (h) In some of the small beach villages present along \nthe undeveloped central sector, houses were built on pilings to minimize the damages caused by \nmigrating dunes (Class 4). \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 21 \n\nFigure 3.1.

As causas das varia\u00e7\u00f5es temporais e espaciais da linha de costa foram \n\navaliadas em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao tamanho de gr\u00e3o, tempestades, ENSO, orienta\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa e \n\ntransporte longitudinal. Atualmente, 20% do litoral ga\u00facho encontra-se urbanizado, enquanto um \n\nter\u00e7o de sua extens\u00e3o apresenta algum n\u00edvel de altera\u00e7\u00e3o antr\u00f3pica. As an\u00e1lises de varia\u00e7\u00f5es da \n\nlinha de costa mostraram diferen\u00e7as regionais na magnitude dos deslocamentos, no padr\u00e3o \n\nsazonal das varia\u00e7\u00f5es e no intervalo de tempo em que a linha de costa retorna a sua configura\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ne posi\u00e7\u00e3o antecedentes. No litoral sul, os deslocamentos anuais da linha de costa mostram \n\nacres\u00e7\u00e3o dominando ao norte do Albard\u00e3o e altern\u00e2ncia entre acres\u00e7\u00e3o e eros\u00e3o ao sul. No litoral \n\nm\u00e9dio, as flutua\u00e7\u00f5es anuais da linha de costa apresentam um padr\u00e3o r\u00edtmico, no qual \u00e1reas em \n\neros\u00e3o ocorrem adjacentes a \u00e1reas em acres\u00e7\u00e3o em um ano e apresentam movimentos opostos no \n\nano seguinte. Os deslocamentos anuais no litoral norte tamb\u00e9m apresentam um comportamento \n\nr\u00edtmico e antag\u00f4nico, em que a acres\u00e7\u00e3o praial dominante em um ano \u00e9 seguida pela eros\u00e3o em \n\noutro. O comportamento antag\u00f4nico dos deslocamentos anuais da linha de costa coincide com os \n\neventos de ENSO. Foi observado tamb\u00e9m que a linha de costa tende a retornar a sua forma e \n\nposi\u00e7\u00e3o anteriores, sazonalmente no litoral sul, anualmente no litoral m\u00e9dio e a cada 19 meses no \n\nlitoral norte. A variabilidade espacial na resposta da linha de costa \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as sazonais e \n\ninteranuais deve-se a uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de fatores, incluindo granulometria, orienta\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de \n\ncosta e transporte sedimentar ao longo da costa. A an\u00e1lise regional da costa do RS permitiu \n\nclassific\u00e1-la em quatro classes de manejo: (1) \u00e1reas de manejo cr\u00edtico, ocorrem em 177 km ou \n\n29% da costa do RS e consistem basicamente nas \u00e1reas urbanizadas, concentradas principalmente \n\nno litoral norte, (2) \u00e1reas priorit\u00e1rias, ocorrem em 198 km ao longo do litoral m\u00e9dio, ocupando \n\n32% da costa do RS, (3) \u00e1reas latentes ocorrem em 65 km ou 10% da costa, localizados no \n\nlitoral sul entre o Hermenegildo e o Albard\u00e3o e (4) \u00e1reas naturais, ao longo de 178 km ou 29% \n\nda costa ga\u00facha, encontradas no litoral central e sul. \n\n\n\n 2 \n\nABSTRACT \n\nThis study presents a regional analysis of the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline based on: \n\nintensity of beachfront urban development, population growth, human impacts in the beach \n\nsystem, temporal and spatial variability of the short-term shoreline changes (seasonal and \n\ninterannual), long-term coastal evolution (Holocene), and classes of coastal management. Human \n\nimpacts (including the intensity of beachfront development) were observed in field surveys \n\nconducted in 2000. Data on population growth were obtained from the 1991 and 2000 Census \n\nprovided by IBGE. The shoreline was mapped five times from 1997 to 2002 using the kinematic \n\nDGPS method and shoreline changes were determined by comparing displacements in shoreline \n\npositions. The influence of grain size variations, storms, ENSO, shoreline orientation, and \n\nlongshore sediment transport in determining the alongshore and temporal variability of shoreline \n\nchanges was analyzed. About 20% of the Rio Grande do Sul coastline is developed, and nearly \n\none third of its length shows some level of human impacts. The analysis of the shoreline changes \n\nshowed regional differences in the magnitude of displacements, in their seasonal effects, and in \n\nthe time-interval in which the shoreline returns to a previous shape and position. Along the \n\nsouthern sector, annual shoreline changes show accretion dominating north of Albard\u00e3o and \n\nalternating areas of erosion and accretion to the south. Along the central sector, annual changes \n\nshow a rhythmic pattern with alternating areas of erosion and accretion showing opposite trends \n\nin the following year. Annual shoreline changes along the northern sector show similar rhythmic \n\nand opposite patterns, although erosion dominates in one year and is followed by erosion in the \n\nnext. The opposite behavior of the annual shoreline movements is coincident with ENSO events. \n\nIt was observed also that the shoreline tends to return to a previous shape and position, seasonally \n\nalong the southern sector, annually along the central sector, and after 19 months in the northern \n\nsector. The alongshore variability in the response of the shoreline to the seasonal and interannual \n\neffects is due to a combination of factors including grain size, shoreline orientation, and \n\nlongshore sediment transport. The regional analysis of the Rio Grande do Sul coast allowed to \n\ndefine four classes of management: (1) critical areas, occur along 177 km or 29% of the \n\ncoastline length and comprises mainly the urbanized areas located mainly along the northern \n\nsector, (2) priority areas, occur along 198 km of the central sector and occupy 32% of the states \n\ncoast, (3) areas of future concern occur along 65 km or 10% of the coast, located along the \n\nsouthern sector, between Hermenegildo and Albard\u00e3o, and (4) natural areas, along 178 km or \n\n29% of the coastal length, present along the southern and central sectors.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 3 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCAP\u00cdTULO 1 \n\n INTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O \n\n\n\n 4 \n\nINTRODU\u00c7\u00c3O \n\nO crescimento demogr\u00e1fico acelerado nas cidades litor\u00e2neas e o aumento progressivo da \n\nurbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o costeira s\u00e3o fen\u00f4menos observados no Brasil e no mundo. O turismo, a recrea\u00e7\u00e3o, o \n\ncom\u00e9rcio e outras atividades relacionadas \u00e0s praias e a outros ambientes costeiros t\u00eam sido o \n\nsuporte econ\u00f4mico de um n\u00famero crescente de comunidades. A depend\u00eancia econ\u00f4mica local e \n\nregional de atividades ligadas ao uso e explora\u00e7\u00e3o da zona costeira tem resultado num constante \n\nconflito do uso do solo, geralmente incompat\u00edvel com as preocupa\u00e7\u00f5es preservacionistas atuais. \n\nAssim, a demanda acelerada pelos recursos naturais costeiros torna imprescind\u00edvel a \n\ncompreens\u00e3o dos processos din\u00e2micos ali atuantes em diversas escalas de tempo e espa\u00e7o. \n\nConhecer as mudan\u00e7as da linha de costa no presente e no passado, bem como fazer proje\u00e7\u00f5es \n\npara o futuro, \u00e9 essencial para a maioria dos projetos de engenharia e planejamento na zona \n\ncosteira (Galgano &amp; Leatherman, 1991; Morton, 1997;  Douglas et al., 1998; Honeycutt et al., \n\n2001; Pajak &amp; Leatherman, 2002). Entre as aplica\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00e1ticas dos estudos das oscila\u00e7\u00f5es da \n\nlinha de costa est\u00e3o: a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas de risco, a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o da perda de terrenos, a \n\ndetermina\u00e7\u00e3o de linhas de recuo para constru\u00e7\u00f5es costeiras e a delimita\u00e7\u00e3o de zonas suscet\u00edveis \u00e0 \n\ninunda\u00e7\u00e3o (NRC, 1990).  \n\nEmbora as varia\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa sejam processos tridimensionais (Parson et al., \n\n1999), a posi\u00e7\u00e3o e o deslocamento horizontal da linha de costa s\u00e3o as vari\u00e1veis que comumente \n\nservem como indicadores de eros\u00e3o e acres\u00e7\u00e3o (Morton et al., 1993; Stockdon et al., 2002). A \n\nrapidez com que as altera\u00e7\u00f5es nos sistemas costeiros est\u00e3o acontecendo torna necess\u00e1ria a \n\nobten\u00e7\u00e3o de dados precisos, em grandes \u00e1reas, de forma r\u00e1pida e que permita atualiza\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nconstante. Recentemente, o enfoque principal dos estudos costeiros tem sido as varia\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\nlarga escala (quil\u00f4metros de extens\u00e3o na ordem de anos) na batimetria adjacente \u00e0 costa e na \n\ntopografia da praia; pois \u00e9 nesta escala que as decis\u00f5es de gerenciamento s\u00e3o tomadas e que uma \n\nmelhor compreens\u00e3o cient\u00edfica \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria (Stockdon et al., 2002). Enquanto mapas \n\ntopogr\u00e1ficos e fotografias a\u00e9reas t\u00eam sido as fontes mais comuns de dados de longo-termo e larga \n\nescala da posi\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa (e.g. Dolan et al., 1980; Smith &amp; Zarillo, 1990; Galgano &amp; \n\nLeatherman, 1991; Hapke &amp; Richmond, 1999), a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de tecnologias avan\u00e7adas, como o \n\nDGPS (Differencial Global Positioning System) cinem\u00e1tico e os sistemas lidar (Light Detection \n\nand Ranging), tem agilizado a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de dados precisos em \u00e1reas extensas (e.g. Brock et al., \n\n1999, 2002; Parson et al., 1999; Stockdon et al., 2002).  \n\nNa Europa e nos EUA, \u00e9 crescente a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de planos de manejo costeiro \n\nregionais subsidiados por \u00f3rg\u00e3os p\u00fablicos, tanto a n\u00edvel estadual (como ocorre nos estados \n\namericanos da Fl\u00f3rida, Nova Jersey, Calif\u00f3rnia, entre outros) quanto nacional (como na \n\nHolanda). Embora os programas de monitoramento costeiro no Brasil estejam muito aqu\u00e9m de \n\npa\u00edses como os EUA, Austr\u00e1lia, Holanda e Espanha, observa-se que nos \u00faltimos anos o assunto \n\n\n\n 5 \n\nvem despertando interesse de \u00f3rg\u00e3os governamentais e institui\u00e7\u00f5es de pesquisa. Contribuiu para \n\nisto o Plano Nacional de Gerenciamento Costeiro (PNGC), criado em 1988 (Lei 7.661, de \n\n16/05/1988) e detalhado em 1990 pela Resolu\u00e7\u00e3o No. 01/90 da Comiss\u00e3o Interministerial para \n\nRecursos do Mar (http://www.mma.gov.br/port/sqa/projeto/gerco/planocac.html). O resultado \u00e9 o \n\ncrescente n\u00famero de projetos de pesquisa integrada a n\u00edvel nacional, regional e internacional, \n\ncomo os projetos Orla (financiado pela Secretaria de Patrim\u00f4nio da Uni\u00e3o, Minist\u00e9rio do \n\nPlanejamento) e Atlas de Eros\u00e3o Costeira, \u00e0 n\u00edvel nacional, e o projeto Eros\u00e3o Costeira: Causas, \n\nAn\u00e1lise de Risco e sua Rela\u00e7\u00e3o com a G\u00eanese de Dep\u00f3sitos Minerais (financiado pela \n\nOrganiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos Estados Americanos), abrangendo a costa do Rio Grande do Sul, Uruguai e \n\nArgentina (Martins et al., 2002). O PNGC estabelece as diretrizes b\u00e1sicas para os Programas de \n\nGerenciamento Costeiro estaduais (GERCO), que no Rio Grande do Sul (RS) \u00e9 coordenado pela \n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o Estadual de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental Henrique Luis Roessler (FEPAM). Com base na \n\nmaior ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o urbana, a FEPAM estabeleceu prioridade para implanta\u00e7\u00e3o do Zoneamento \n\nEcol\u00f3gico-Econ\u00f4mico e o Enquadramento dos Recursos H\u00eddricos no litoral norte (FEPAM, \n\n2000), enquanto os litorais m\u00e9dio e sul, ainda pouco ocupados, esperam regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nPlanos de gerenciamento costeiro integrado visam promover o desenvolvimento \n\nsustent\u00e1vel buscando proteger os recursos naturais, buscando um equil\u00edbrio entre as atividades \n\nantr\u00f3picas (s\u00f3cio-econ\u00f4micas e culturais) e o ambiente f\u00edsico (Cicin-Sain &amp; Knecht, 1998). Desta \n\nforma, a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de estrat\u00e9gias de manejo costeiro requer um certo grau de conhecimento \n\ndos processos din\u00e2micos atuantes ao longo da costa. O conhecimento das rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre os \n\nprocessos costeiros e sua influ\u00eancia nas varia\u00e7\u00f5es morfol\u00f3gicas ao longo da costa do Rio Grande \n\ndo Sul vem aumentando nos \u00faltimos anos, mas muitas lacunas ainda precisam ser preenchidas. \n\nEste estudo apresenta uma abordagem regional de fatores inerentes \u00e0 press\u00e3o antr\u00f3pica e \u00e0 \n\ndin\u00e2mica de processos naturais utilizados para definir setores da costa que apresentam diferentes \n\nnecessidades de manejo. Para tanto, a costa ga\u00facha foi caracterizada em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do estado atual \n\nde altera\u00e7\u00e3o das praias, n\u00edvel de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o urbana, taxas de crescimento populacional, varia\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nda linha de costa de curto termo e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o geol\u00f3gica de longo termo. Aten\u00e7\u00e3o especial foi dada \n\n\u00e0 identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de padr\u00f5es regionais no comportamento das varia\u00e7\u00f5es na posi\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de \n\ncosta em escalas de tempo sazonal e interanual e sua variabilidade ao longo da costa. \n\nAdicionalmente, discute-se os fatores que influenciam a variabilidade espacial e temporal das \n\nflutua\u00e7\u00f5es na posi\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa, como granulometria dos sedimentos praias, orienta\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nlinha de costa, transporte litor\u00e2neo, tempestades, El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) e \n\ntransporte longitudinal. Desta forma, este estudo contribui para ampliar a compreens\u00e3o da \n\nvariabilidade din\u00e2mica da linha de costa e suas inter-rela\u00e7\u00f5es, apresentando resultados in\u00e9ditos \n\npara o RS no que se refere \u00e0 extens\u00e3o e a continuidade da \u00e1rea de estudo e os m\u00e9todos adotados.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 6 \n\nOBJETIVOS \n\nO objetivo geral deste estudo consiste em determinar padr\u00f5es de comportamento das \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa e avaliar o estado de altera\u00e7\u00e3o antr\u00f3pica das praias para identificar \n\n\u00e1reas cr\u00edticas e priorit\u00e1rias para o gerenciamento costeiro no RS. Para atingir este objetivo geral, \n\nas seguintes etapas de trabalho foram executadas: \n\n(a) Classificar a costa do RS em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do atual estado de altera\u00e7\u00e3o antr\u00f3pica de suas praias, \n\nincluindo ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o urbana, estado de preserva\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema praia-duna, taxas de \n\ncrescimento populacional e impactos antr\u00f3picos dominantes. \n\n(b) Montar um banco de dados com as posi\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa obtidas atrav\u00e9s de \n\nmapeamentos realizados por DGPS cinem\u00e1tico entre 1997 e 2002 e determinar padr\u00f5es \n\nde comportamento ao longo do tempo e  ao longo da costa. \n\n(c) Classificar a costa ga\u00facha em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do comportamento das varia\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa, \n\ndeterminando \u00e1reas com tend\u00eancias \u00e0 eros\u00e3o, estabilidade ou acres\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n(d) Avaliar os fatores causadores da variabilidade espacial e temporal observada nos padr\u00f5es \n\nde comportamento da linha de costa. \n\n(e) Correlacionar as caracter\u00edsticas ambientais regionais, a intensidade de uso e ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o, a \n\nevolu\u00e7\u00e3o costeira de longo-termo e as varia\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa de curto-termo para \n\nidentificar diferentes classes de gerenciamento costeiro. \n\n \n\nJUSTIFICATIVAS \n\nAs an\u00e1lises das varia\u00e7\u00f5es na posi\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa cujos dados foram obtidos pelo \n\nm\u00e9todo de DGPS cinem\u00e1tico ao longo de aproximadamente 610 km da costa do RS constituem \n\num estudo in\u00e9dito no Brasil no que se refere \u00e0 extens\u00e3o da \u00e1rea de estudo, ao detalhamento \n\nespacial apresentado e ao m\u00e9todo utilizado. Observando trabalhos similares publicados na \n\nliteratura internacional, nota-se que a extens\u00e3o da \u00e1rea de estudo torna este trabalho sem \n\nprecedentes tamb\u00e9m \u00e0 n\u00edvel mundial, j\u00e1 que as maiores extens\u00f5es costeiras cont\u00edguas mapeadas \n\npor DGPS s\u00e3o de 130 km ao longo da costa da Carolina do Norte, EUA (List &amp; Farris, 1999; List \n\net al., 2003). A continuidade e a rapidez na obten\u00e7\u00e3o de dados por DGPS cinem\u00e1tico possibilitam \n\navaliar como diferentes trechos da costa respondem a condi\u00e7\u00f5es energ\u00e9ticas semelhantes. Esta \n\ncontinuidade ao longo da costa amplia o conhecimento que se tem hoje das varia\u00e7\u00f5es costeiras no \n\nRS, que \u00e9 basicamente pontual, limitado a poucos locais e esparso ao longo da costa.  \n\nA identifica\u00e7\u00e3o da rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre causa e efeito para explicar a variabilidade temporal e \n\nespacial do comportamento das mudan\u00e7as da linha de costa, a identifica\u00e7\u00e3o das \u00e1reas suscet\u00edvies \n\n\n\n 7 \n\n\u00e0 eros\u00e3o e a quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o das magnitudes das flutua\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa s\u00e3o resultados deste \n\nestudo que contribuem para aprimorar a compreens\u00e3o da din\u00e2mica costeira no RS. Al\u00e9m disso, a \n\nan\u00e1lise integrada em escala regional das varia\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa em diferentes escalas de \n\ntempo associadas \u00e0s tend\u00eancias de crescimento populacional fornece subs\u00eddios importantes para \n\ndefinir estrat\u00e9gias adequadas de gerenciamento costeiro.  \n\n \n\nORGANIZA\u00c7\u00c3O DA TESE \n\nEsta tese foi elaborada na forma de apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o de artigos que correspondem \u00e0s \n\ndiferentes etapas de trabalho realizadas neste estudo.

O artigo apresentado no Cap\u00edtulo 6 intitula-se \n\n\n\n 8 \n\n\u201cShoreline changes and coastal evolution as parameters to identify priority areas for \n\nmanagement in Rio Grande do Sul\u201d e foi submetido para publica\u00e7\u00e3o na revista Pesquisas em \n\nGeoci\u00eancias. Este cap\u00edtulo faz uma an\u00e1lise regional da costa do RS em fun\u00e7\u00e3o de fatores \n\nabordados nos cap\u00edtulos anteriores, como o n\u00edvel de urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o e altera\u00e7\u00e3o das praias, varia\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nda linha de costa de curto per\u00edodo e evolu\u00e7\u00e3o costeira no Holoceno. Atrav\u00e9s da an\u00e1lise integrada \n\ndesses fatores, quatro classes de gerenciamento costeiro s\u00e3o identificadas para a costa do RS: \n\n\u00e1reas de gerenciamento cr\u00edtico, \u00e1reas priorit\u00e1rias, \u00e1reas latentes e \u00e1reas naturais. O cap\u00edtulo 7 \n\napresenta as conclus\u00f5es finais da tese integrando o que foi apresentado em cada artigo e, \n\nfinalmente, no Cap\u00edtulo 8, est\u00e3o listadas as refer\u00eancias citadas nos cap\u00edtulos anteriores. \n\n \n\nM\u00c9TODOS \n\nA costa do RS foi classificada em fun\u00e7\u00e3o das caracter\u00edsticas ambientais dominantes e o \n\nseu estado de altera\u00e7\u00e3o decorrente de interfer\u00eancias antr\u00f3picas com base em observa\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ncampo obtidas em maio e julho de 2000. O m\u00e9todo consistiu em conduzir um ve\u00edculo com tra\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nnas quatro rodas pela praia anotando as caracter\u00edsticas observadas e marcando a dist\u00e2ncia ao \n\nlongo da costa pelo od\u00f4metro do ve\u00edculo. Nas excurs\u00f5es de campo, 556 km dos 618 km da costa \n\ndo estado foram mapeados, observando-se as seguintes caracter\u00edsticas: \n\n(a) Urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o. Foram determinados tr\u00eas n\u00edveis de urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nporcentagem da extens\u00e3o da beira-mar que se encontrava urbanizada: intensa (ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nem mais de 70% da linha de costa), moderada (ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o da beira-mar entre 30 e 70%) e \n\nbaixa ou n\u00e3o ocupada (ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o menor do que 30%). Anotou-se tamb\u00e9m os tipos de \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00f5es (e.g., pr\u00e9dios, casas, residenciais, comerciais), o padr\u00e3o de constru\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dio \n\nem cada setor (alto, m\u00e9dio e baixo) e o local onde a primeira faixa de constru\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e1 \n\nassentada (no p\u00f3s-praia, nas dunas ou atr\u00e1s das dunas).  \n\n(b) Altera\u00e7\u00f5es antr\u00f3picas. Todo tipo de interfer\u00eancia decorrente de atividades humanas foi \n\nregistrado, incluindo: lixo sobre a praia, retirada de areia da praia e dunas, presen\u00e7a de \n\nobras de prote\u00e7\u00e3o costeira (e.g., muros de conten\u00e7\u00e3o, enrocamentos, fixa\u00e7\u00e3o ou \n\nreconstru\u00e7\u00e3o de dunas), reflorestamentos comerciais, tr\u00e1fego sobre a praia, plataformas \n\nde pesca, entre outras. Considerou-se alterados, os trechos onde as atividades antr\u00f3picas \n\ncausaram mudan\u00e7as percebidas visualmente nas caracter\u00edsticas naturais da praia. \n\nDesde 1997, a linha de costa no RS vem sendo monitorada por pesquisadores do Centro \n\nde Estudos de Geologia Costeira e Oce\u00e2nica (CECO) e do Instituto de Pesquisas Hidr\u00e1ulicas \n\n(IPH) da UFRGS utilizando o m\u00e9todo de DGPS cinem\u00e1tico (Morton et al., 1993; Morton, 1997; \n\nToldo et al., 1999). Os 618 km da costa ga\u00facha foram percorridos com o DGPS instalado em um \n\nve\u00edculo que se desloca com velocidade de 50 km/h obtendo as posi\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa em \n\n\n\n 9 \n\nintervalos de tempo regulares. Em 1997, dois Garmin GPS 100 Personal Surveyor foram \n\nutilizados, um deles instalado em um ve\u00edculo em movimento registrando posi\u00e7\u00f5es a cada 5 s e o \n\noutro, operando no modo est\u00e1tico, foi posicionado em locais previamente escolhidos com o \n\nobjetivo de aumentar a precis\u00e3o das leituras para 3 m. Nos anos seguintes, a corre\u00e7\u00e3o dos dados \n\nfoi feita pela antena de Porto Alegre, e n\u00e3o mais pelo GPS em modo est\u00e1tico. A partir de 2000, \n\npassou-se a utilizar o equipamento Trimble GPS 4600, com precis\u00e3o de 1 m no modo de \n\nnavega\u00e7\u00e3o, registrando as leituras a cada 3 s. A fei\u00e7\u00e3o indicadora da linha de costa mapeada em \n\n26-28/11/1997, 17-19/11/1998, 10-11 e 19/11/1999 e 26-28/06/2000 foi a linha d'\u00e1gua (swash \n\nline). O indicador mapeado em 15-17/04/2002 foi a linha deixada pela \u00faltima mar\u00e9 alta ou a high \n\nwater line (HWL), que \u00e9 o indicador mais utilizado por ser facilmente identificado como sendo o \n\nlimite entre areia seca e areia \u00famida (Pajak &amp; Leatherman, 2002; Morton, 1997; Crowell et al., \n\n1991; Dolan et al., 1980). Para efeito de compara\u00e7\u00e3o com as outras linhas, a posi\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de \n\n2002 foi corrigida conforme descrito no Cap\u00edtulo 5. Importante ressaltar que estas fei\u00e7\u00f5es foram \n\nescolhidas como indicadoras da linha de costa por serem as \u00fanicas cont\u00ednuas ao longo de toda a \n\n\u00e1rea de estudo, al\u00e9m de serem as \u00fanicas que permitem mapeamento utilizando-se o DGPS \n\ninstalado em um ve\u00edculo. \n\nA visualiza\u00e7\u00e3o das linhas mapeadas e as medi\u00e7\u00f5es das dist\u00e2ncias entre elas foram \n\nrealizadas atrav\u00e9s do programa ArcView GIS 3.2. Inicialmente, as medi\u00e7\u00f5es foram feitas \n\nmanualmente, adotando-se um procedimento que pode ser descrito em tr\u00eas etapas:  \n\n(1) Cria\u00e7\u00e3o de \"marcos virtuais\". Foi gerado um arquivo de pontos no ArcView, onde \n\ncada ponto representa um \u201cmarco virtual\u201d ao longo da costa. Esses marcos servem como \n\nponto de refer\u00eancia para as medi\u00e7\u00f5es das dist\u00e2ncias entre as diferentes linhas de \n\nmapeamento. Os marcos foram gerados sobre a linha de costa mapeada em 2000, com \n\nintervalos de aproximadamente 500 m entre eles. Os marcos s\u00e3o numerados \n\nsequencialmente a partir do extremo sul, ou seja, o marco de n\u00famero 1 localiza-se \n\npr\u00f3ximo da barra do Chu\u00ed (Figuras 2.1 e 2.2). Uma lista com todos os 1121 marcos \n\ngerados e suas respectivas coordenadas (em sistema UTM), obtidas em escala de 1:50 na \n\ntela de trabalho do ArcView, foi organizada em planilha eletr\u00f4nica (MS Excel 2000), que \n\nserviu de base para o banco de dados das varia\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa. \n\n(2) Defini\u00e7\u00e3o das transects.  As transects s\u00e3o linhas definidas perpendicularmente \u00e0 linha \n\nde costa de 2000 a partir dos marcos virtuais, sobre as quais foram feitas as medi\u00e7\u00f5es das \n\ndist\u00e2ncias entre as demais linhas de costa mapeadas. As transects foram definidas em \n\nintervalos de 1 km, ou seja sobre marcos virtuais alternados. Ao todo foram criadas 568 \n\ntransects numeradas de acordo com os marcos aos quais est\u00e3o ligadas, organizadas em \n\num arquivo de linhas no ArcView.  \n\n\n\n 10 \n\n(3) Medi\u00e7\u00f5es das dist\u00e2ncias entre as linhas de mapeamento. As medi\u00e7\u00f5es de dist\u00e2ncias \n\nentre as linhas de mapeamento foram realizadas sobre as transects (i.e., em intervalos de \n\n1 km ao longo da costa), em escalas entre 1:20 e 1:150 na tela de trabalho do ArcView. \n\nOs valores registrados na planilha eletr\u00f4nica representam o deslocamento de uma linha \n\nem rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s outras e receberam valores negativos quando o deslocamento foi em \n\ndire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 costa (eros\u00e3o da linha de costa) ou positivos, quando o deslocamento foi em \n\ndire\u00e7\u00e3o ao mar (acres\u00e7\u00e3o).  \n\nNo Cap\u00edtulo 3, as tend\u00eancias de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa apresentadas no texto foram \n\nbaseadas na compara\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa obtida em 2000 atrav\u00e9s do DGPS cinem\u00e1tico com a \n\nlinha de costa digitalizada a partir de cartas topogr\u00e1ficas do ex\u00e9rcito brasileiro (escala de \n\n1:50.000) datadas de 1975. Os deslocamentos da linha de costa entre as duas linhas foram \n\nmedidos manualmente atrav\u00e9s do programa ArcView 3.2, conforme o procedimento descrito \n\nacima. Nos cap\u00edtulos posteriores, o programa Digital Shoreline Analysis System 2.0 (DSAS) \n\ndesenvolvido pelo U.S. Geological Survey (Thieler et al., 2003) especificamente para calcular \n\ntaxas de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa foi utilizado para verificar as medidas de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de \n\ncosta obtidas manualmente para o per\u00edodo entre novembro/1997 e abril/2002. O comportamento \n\ndas varia\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa observado pelos dois m\u00e9todos foi semelhante, embora os valores \n\nnominais das estat\u00edsticas obtidas tenham apresentado uma pequena diferen\u00e7a. Esta diferen\u00e7a \n\ndeve-se \u00e0 grande variabilidade longitudinal na posi\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa e ao fato de que o DSAS \n\npermitiu aumentar a densidade espacial dos dados, que foram estimados em intervalos de 250 m, \n\nenquanto os dados obtidos manualmente foram obtidos em intervalos de 1000 m. Os cap\u00edtulos 4, \n\n5 e 6 apresentam dados de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa obtidos atrav\u00e9s do DSAS.  \n\nTanto os dados obtidos pelas medi\u00e7\u00f5es manuais (identifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos marcos virtuais, suas \n\ncoordenadas geogr\u00e1ficas, as dist\u00e2ncias medidas entre as linhas de costa e as escalas de medi\u00e7\u00e3o) \n\nquanto os obtidos pelo DSAS foram organizados em planilha eletr\u00f4nica, a partir da qual foram \n\ngerados gr\u00e1ficos de deslocamento da linha de costa e calculados os par\u00e2metros estat\u00edsticos das  \n\nlinhas de deslocamento. Nos gr\u00e1ficos, os deslocamentos em dire\u00e7\u00e3o ao mar (acres\u00e7\u00e3o) s\u00e3o \n\nrepresentados por valores positivos e os deslocamentos em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 costa por valores negativos \n\n(eros\u00e3o). A an\u00e1lise desses gr\u00e1ficos permitiu identificar padr\u00f5es de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa para \n\nos tr\u00eas setores do litoral e seus efeitos sazonais e interanuais, descritos nos Cap\u00edtulos 4 e 5. Os \n\ngr\u00e1ficos de taxas de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa foram utilizados para determinar as tend\u00eancias de \n\ncurto-termo e comparar com a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o costeira de m\u00e9dio e longo prazos (Cap\u00edtulos 4 e 6).  \n\nAdicionalmente, taxas de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa foram estimadas a partir de \n\nfotografias a\u00e9reas verticais datadas de janeiro de 1974 e fevereiro de 1989 (escala de 1:20.000) \n\nconcedidas pelo Departamento Aut\u00f4nomo de Estradas de Rodagens (DAER), e fotografias a\u00e9reas \n\ndigitais de pequeno formato datadas de 2000 obtidas pela Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Universidade Federal do Rio \n\n\n\n 11 \n\nGrande (FURG) utilizando o ADAR-1000 system (Fontoura &amp; Hartmann, 2001). Pelo menos \n\nseis pontos de controle foram identificados em cada fotografia e as dist\u00e2ncias entre eles foram \n\nmedidas para estabelecer erros decorrentes de distor\u00e7\u00f5es e da capacidade de identificar a \n\nlocaliza\u00e7\u00e3o exata dos pontos utilizados nas medi\u00e7\u00f5es. A largura das praias foi medidas a cada \n\n150 m ou 200 m em frente a pontos est\u00e1veis estabelecidos ao longo de pelo menos 2 km de \n\nextens\u00e3o em cinco setores diferentes do litoral norte. Utilizando-se as medi\u00e7\u00f5es obtidas em cada \n\nsetor, taxas de varia\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e9dias foram estimadas para cada uma das praias. Os resultados dessas \n\nan\u00e1lises est\u00e3o apresentados no Cap\u00edtulo 4. \n\nA identifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas cr\u00edticas e priorit\u00e1rias para o gerenciamento costeiro no RS foi \n\nrealizada correlacionando-se os fatores descritos nos Cap\u00edtulos 2, 3, 4 e 5, ou seja, a intensidade \n\nde ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o e uso, as varia\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa de curto-termo e seus efeitos sazonais e \n\ntemporais, a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o costeira de longo-termo, al\u00e9m das taxas de crescimento populacional entre \n\n1990 e 2000 fornecidas pelo Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat\u00edstica (IBGE, 2000). Assim, \n\nforam definidas quatro classes que apresentam diferentes necessidades de manejo: \n\n(1) \u00c1reas cr\u00edticas. S\u00e3o \u00e1reas que requerem medidas de gerenciamento costeiro corretivo. \n\nApresentam urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o intensa e/ou crescente ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o e uso do solo, tend\u00eancia \u00e0 \n\neros\u00e3o e/ou destrui\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas costeiras durante eventos de alta energia, magnitudes \n\nde deslocamento da linha de costa que excedem a largura m\u00e9dia da praia emersa, dunas \n\nprim\u00e1rias ausentes ou muito alteradas.  \n\n(2) \u00c1reas de a\u00e7\u00e3o priorit\u00e1ria.

Apresentam urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o moderada ou baixa, \n\ntaxas de crescimento populacional acima da m\u00e9dia do estado, recente intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o do \n\nuso (turismo, valoriza\u00e7\u00e3o imobili\u00e1ria, conflitos de interesses), tend\u00eancia \u00e0 estabilidade ou \n\neros\u00e3o no curto ou longo-termo e grandes magnitudes de deslocamento da linha de costa. \n\n(3) \u00c1reas latentes. S\u00e3o \u00e1reas que atualmente n\u00e3o se encontram sob grande press\u00e3o de uso, \n\nmas que num futuro pr\u00f3ximo podem se tornar \u00e1reas de a\u00e7\u00e3o priorit\u00e1ria, portanto \u00e9 \n\naconselh\u00e1vel a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de medidas reguladoras de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o e uso. Apresentam \n\nsistema praia/duna preservado ou pouco alterado, urbaniza\u00e7\u00e3o moderada a baixa, e \n\ntend\u00eancia \u00e0 eros\u00e3o ou estabilidade/acres\u00e7\u00e3o com grandes magnitudes de deslocamento da \n\nlinha de costa.

Journal of Coastal Research, SI 35, 548-556. \n\n\n\n 13 \n\nABSTRACT \n\nRio Grande do Sul (RS), the southernmost state in Brazil, has a 630-km long shoreline \n\ndominated by undeveloped sandy beaches. Unlike other states in Brazil, its colonization was \n\nmore intense inland resulting in less than 5% of the state\u2019s population living in coastal cities. \n\nMany of the urbanized shores consist in small villages occupied only in the summer months. \n\nHowever, in the last decade there has been a change in this trend as coastal population is growing \n\nfaster than the state\u2019s average. Many studies show that most of RS beaches are retreating, so it is \n\nurgent the implementation of a management plan to regulate occupation along the undeveloped \n\nshores to avoid new settlements in a hazardous coast. This work characterizes the RS coast based \n\non the state of alteration of its beaches, which might be useful to support a statewide coastal \n\nmanagement plan. The state shores were classified into four classes according to the dominant \n\ncoastal environment (rocky headlands or open sandy beaches), type and distribution of developed \n\nshores (i.e. degree of urban development, type of beachfront constructions, urbanization in dune \n\nareas), and the impact of human activities. Developed and impacted shores comprise Classes 1, \n\n2, and 3 that are prograding beaches influenced by headlands, accreted open sandy beaches, and \n\nmainly retreating open sandy beaches, respectively. Class 4 consists in undeveloped sandy \n\nbeaches that represents 76% of the state shoreline length. Despite the long undeveloped shore \n\nsegments, human activities are already impacting 31% of the RS shoreline. The length of \n\nimpacted shores might increase in the near future (due to the implementation of new road access \n\nto undeveloped areas) as unplanned new development occurs along retreating shores.  \n\n \n\nAdditional Index Words: Coastal environments, management, shore classification, beach erosion. \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nBeach erosion is a worldwide problem (BIRD, 1985) that has been widely observed in \n\nthe state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), southern Brazil (Figure 2.1). According to TOLDO JR. et \n\nal. (1999), most of the RS coast is retreating at high rates, as along 378 km (about 60% of the \n\ntotal shore length) the shoreline retreated more than 100 m in 22 years. Several studies have \n\naddressed erosion in RS beaches indicating many natural and human-induced contributing factors \n\nto this process (i.e. SIEGLE, 1996; KLEIN and CALLIARI, 1997; TOMAZELLI et al. 1998; \n\nCALLIARI et al., 1998; ESTEVES et al., 1999; TOLDO JR. et al., 1999). Shore erosion is still \n\nnot a big issue in RS because, except for the northern sector, its shoreline is mainly undeveloped \n\nand coastal population is less than 5% of the state\u2019s total (9.7 million). Despite of the long \n\n\n\n 14 \n\nundeveloped coastal segments and the small coastal population, the pressure of fast-growing, \n\ncoastal urban centers is already impacting the shore. \n\nHistorically, colonization in the RS has been more intense inland than along the coast \n\n(MORAES, 1995). However, six of the ten cities that had the greatest population growth in the \n\nlast decade are on the coast, evidencing that more people have moved from inland to live by the \n\nsea. Thus, it is evident that coastal population will grow faster in the near future and undeveloped \n\nareas soon will give place to new settlements. Considering that most of the state shores are \n\nretreating, it is urgent that a management plan based on local characteristics regulates new \n\ncoastal development to avoid occupation of hazardous areas. \n\nThis work evaluates the present state of the RS beaches according to the characteristics \n\nand distribution of urban development and other human-induced alterations (e.g. sand mining, \n\ndestruction of dunes, presence of shore protection structures). The goal is to present a \n\ncomprehensive characterization of the state shorelines that provides valuable information to \n\nsupport a statewide coastal management plan. However, at this moment, characterization will be \n\nfocused on the aspects of coastal development as many of the physical and morphological \n\nparameters that are very important to establish the best management practices will not be \n\ndiscussed in this paper due to space constrains.  \n\n \n\nSTUDY AREA \n\nThe RS has a 630-km long coastline formed mainly by exposed fine sand beaches that \n\nhave a NE-SW general orientation (Figure 2.1). These beaches are part of a large coastal plain \n\nextending from the headland of granite rocks at Cabo Polonio in Uruguay to the basalts of the \n\nSerra Geral Formation at Torres in the northern limit of the state (TOLDO JR. et al., 1999). The \n\ncoastal plain consists in a complex multiple sandy barrier composed of four lagoon-barrier \n\ndepositional systems formed by sea-level fluctuations in the Quaternary (VILLWOCK, 1984). \n\nThis coastal plain presents two large lagoons (Patos and Mirim) and several other small lagoons \n\nand lakes that trap sand from fluvial discharge, reducing the volume of sand reaching the shore \n\n(TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). Two stabilized small inlets mark the northern and southern borders, \n\nthe Mampituba river and the Chu\u00ed creek, respectively. The Tramanda\u00ed and the Patos Lagoon \n\ninlets are the only permanent discontinuities along the RS coast. They are both stabilized, but the \n\nsecond is much larger having two 4-km long jetties to fix the navigation channel of the Rio \n\nGrande Port, the third largest in Brazil. Innumerous permanent and temporary washouts cut the \n\nstate beaches to discharge water accumulated behind the dunes and are important features to the \n\nsand balance. \n\n\n\n 15 \n\nWaves are the dominant hydrodynamic process along the RS coast, as the maximum \n\ntidal variation is less than 0.5 m (TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). Winds from NE are dominant \n\nalthough southerly winds are the strongest and generate higher waves. As southerly waves have \n\nhigher energy, the net longshore sediment transport is to the north, as can be observed in the \n\naccreted shores south of the Rio Grande jetty and the eroded profile of downdrift beaches. \n\nStorms associated to the passage of cold fronts frequently strike the coast in fall and winter \n\nmonths, mainly April and July (CALLIARI et al., 1998). These events generally pile water \n\nonshore resulting in storm surges of about 1 m that combined to high-energy waves cause intense \n\ncoastal erosion.  \n\n \n\nArbitrarily, the RS coast can be separated into three coastal sectors to facilitate \n\ndescription of its morphologic characteristics: (a) the northern sector extends from Torres (at the \n\nborder with the state of Santa Catarina) to Dunas Altas (Palmares do Sul) in the south, (b) the \n\ncentral sector includes the beaches in between Dunas Altas and the Patos Lagoon inlet (S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 \n\ndo Norte), and (c) the southern sector consists in the shores from the Patos Lagoon inlet to the \n\nChu\u00ed creek (at the border with Uruguay). The northern sector is a 136.5\u2013km long highly \n\nurbanized shore that concentrates most of the coastal urban centers in the state (10 out of the 16 \n\ncoastal towns). The central and southern sectors are mainly undeveloped, as the first presents \n\nonly small fishing villages separated by long undeveloped shorelines and the second has only \n\nthree urbanized beaches (Cassino, Hermenegildo, and Chu\u00ed).  \n\nWell-sorted fine quartzose sands dominate in the RS beaches, as it was observed in \n\nseveral studies that addressed specific beach segments such as from Arroio do Sal to Imb\u00e9 \n\nFigure 2.1. The study area consists in the 630-km long shoreline of Rio \n\nGrande do Sul, the southernmost state of Brazil. \n\n\n\n 16 \n\n(WESCHENFELDER et al., 1997) and Torres (PIVEL, 1997) in the northern sector, from \n\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o Lighthouse to Hermenegildo (SIEGLE, 1996), in the southern and part of the central \n\nsector, and from Cassino to Chu\u00ed (CALLIARI and KLEIN, 1993) covering the southern sector. \n\nCALLIARI and KLEIN (1993) and SIEGLE (1996) observed slightly variations on beach \n\nsediments mean size in three areas: (1) south of the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Lighthouse, mean sizes are \n\ncoarser and less sorted due to the presence of shell fragments; (2) in Cassino, the influence of \n\nfine sediments from the Patos Lagoon causes a slightly decrease in the mean size, and (3) \n\nbetween Albard\u00e3o Lighthouse and Hermenegildo there is a 30-km long segment (Concheiros do \n\nAlbard\u00e3o) that presents bimodal sediments composed by quartzose fine sands and bioclastic \n\ngravel.  \n\nCALLIARI and KLEIN (1993) classified beaches in the southern sector according to \n\ntheir morphodynamic state in three areas: from Cassino to Sarita Lighthouse beaches are \n\ndissipative; in the 30-km long Concheiros do Albard\u00e3o, beaches are reflective to intermediate, \n\nand the remaining beaches are classified as intermediate. Beaches in the central coastal sector \n\nwere classified as intermediate and highly susceptible to sand volume changes (BARLETTA et \n\nal., 1999) while in the northern sector (Imb\u00e9 and Tramanda\u00ed) beaches have been classified as \n\nintermediate to dissipative (TOLDO JR. et al., 1993). \n\n \n\nMETHODS \n\nThis study characterizes the RS shorelines according to the dominant type of coastal \n\nenvironment and the present state of human-induced alterations. Most of the data was obtained in \n\nfour field trips conducted in May and July 2000, which consisted in driving along the beaches \n\ntaking notes on the characteristics of the backshore and dune fields and the type of urbanization \n\nthat could be seen from the beach (mainly beachfront properties). The field trips covered about \n\n556 km of the state 627-km long shoreline. Thus, 71 km of undeveloped shores were not mapped \n\nin this study (Figure 2.2) due to bad weather conditions experienced at the time. Although this \n\nshore segment was not covered at this time, it is well known from previous studies, and was \n\nincluded in the results to allow the entire shoreline length to be analyzed. Longshore distance \n\nwas marked in the car odometer and registered in the field notes when coastal characteristics \n\nchanged. Observations focused on beach and dune features, characteristics of urban \n\ndevelopment, and other human-induced alterations. Mapped features and classes are shown in \n\nFigure 2.2. \n\nPresence of dunes, blowouts, and sand plains were registered. Dunes were classified as \n\nvegetated or non-vegetated and high (more than 1.5-m high) or low (less than 1.5-m high). The \n\ndegree of urban development was established based on the percentage of beachfront lots that \n\n\n\n 17 \n\nwere built up and classified into three classes: (a) none or low development, when less than 30% \n\nof the area is occupied by buildings or other infrastructures; (b) moderate development, 30 to \n\n70% of the shoreline is developed, and (c) highly developed shores, when more than 70% of the \n\nshoreline is built up. Additional notes consisted in the type (single or multi-family) and quality \n\n(high, normal, or low standards) of the major part of the buildings along a coastal sector, and \n\nwhere they were built (on the beach, dunes, or behind the dunes). Human-induced alterations \n\nvisually observed in the beach system during the field trips were registered, including: sand \n\nmining, traffic, presence of debris, commercial afforestation, shore protection structures, dune \n\nfixation or reconstruction, fishing piers, and others. Shorelines were considered as altered where \n\nhuman activities visually changed and interfered in the natural coastal processes. \n\n \n\nCLASSIFICATION OF COASTAL SEGMENTS \n\nMany aspects of the RS coast have been extensively studied (e.g. beach \n\nmorphodynamics, evidences of beach erosion) and many others still need to be evaluated (e.g. \n\nshoreline retreat rates, human impacts) to support management decisions. In an attempt to \n\nprovide an overall picture of the state of RS beaches, a statewide evaluation of the human-\n\ninduced impacts is presented (Figure 2.2). The RS shorelines can be grouped into four classes \n\naccording to their natural characteristics and the impacts of human activities: (1) prograding \n\nbeaches under the influence of rocky headlands, (2) impacted and prograding open sandy \n\nbeaches, (3) developed and mainly eroding beaches, and (4) undeveloped open sandy beaches. \n\nClasses can be further subdivided in sectors presenting slightly differences in one or more \n\ncriteria. \n\n \n\nClass 1: Prograding Beaches under the Influence of Rocky Headlands \n\nThis class consists of the northernmost 8.4-km long shore segment (about 1.3% of the \n\nstate shoreline length), comprising the beaches of Torres (Grande, Prainha, da Cal, Guarita, and \n\nItapeva). The northern limit is the jetty of the Mampituba river that marks the border with the \n\nstate of Santa Catarina and the southern limit is the small rocky promontory of Itapeva. Due to \n\nthe littoral drift obstruction by the Mampituba jetty, Class 1 beaches have a positive sand balance \n\nthat is easily observed in Praia Grande. There, beach widths have increased significantly in the \n\nlast decade and artificial fixation of the dunes was conducted as they were invading the road and \n\ninfrastructures located behind (PIVEL, 1997). Additionally, the presence of rocky headlands \n\nmight contribute to the accreted condition of the other beaches, as even Prainha that often had its \n\nrocky basement completely exposed has shown a larger and thicker sand cover with time. These \n\n\n\n 18 \n\nheadlands are the only rocky shores in the state and consist of Botucatu sandstones accumulated \n\nin a desert environment and basalt (Serra Geral Formation) that flowed over them during the \n\nopening of the South Atlantic Ocean (upper Jurassic- lower Cretaceous) (VILLWOCK, 1984). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.2. Classification of the RS coastline according to its state of human-induced alteration, degree and \n\nposition of urban development, and presence of man-made forested areas. The northern sector (from Torres to \n\nDunas Altas) consists mainly in highly developed and altered shores, while central (from Dunas Altas to the \n\nPatos Lagoon inlet) and southern sectors (south of the Patos Lagoon inlet) are mainly undeveloped and \n\npreserved beaches. \n\n\n\n 19 \n\nTorres is one of the largest coastal cities in the state presenting a permanent population \n\nof about 26,000 people. Half of its 8.4 km-long shore is developed (Table 1), mainly Praia \n\nGrande and Praia da Cal. Beachfront properties consists in single-family houses although larger \n\nbuildings are observed one or two blocks from the beach. Landscaping works using exotic and \n\nnative plants are observed along part of the Prainha and Praia da Cal. Undeveloped shores \n\ninclude Guarita (Figure 3a) that is inside a State Park and Itapeva that has already few houses and \n\nfacilities built at the top of the dunes. Development, constructions on the dunes (houses, drink \n\nand food facilities, and sidewalks), the presence of a jetty, and landscaping contributed to include \n\n63% of the Class 1 length into altered shorelines (Table 1).  \n\n \n\nTable 2.1. Classification of the Rio Grande do Sul shorelines according to the length of \n\ndeveloped shorelines, urbanized dunes, afforestation, and altered (impacted) shores. \n\nClass Length \nUrbanized \n\nShores \n\nUrbanized \n\nDunes \nAfforestation Altered Shores \n\nSegment km km % km % km % km % \n\n1 8.4 4.2 50.0 0.5 6.0 0.3 3.6 5.3 63.1 \n\n2 10.9 5.1 46.8 0.8 7.3 0 0 10.9 100 \n\nNorthern 126.2 100.0 79.2 51.1 40.5 47.4 37.6 97.8 77.5 \n\nHermenegildo 2.5 2.5 100 2.5 100 0 0 2.5 100 \n\nChu\u00ed 0.9 0.9 100 0.9 100 0 0 0.9 100 \n\n3 129.6 103.4 79.8 54.5 42.1 47.4 36.6 101.2 78.1 \n\nCentral sector  266.2 10.4 3.9 10.4 3.9 59.3 22.3 35.3 13.3 \n\nSoutheast 199.8 0 0 0.3 0.2 63.7 31.9 40.5 20.3 \n\nSouthern 12.4 0.3 2.4 0.3 2.4 0 0 1.9 15.3 \n\n4 478.4 10.7 2.2 11.0 2.3 123.0 25.7 77.7 16.2 \n\nTotal 627.3 123.4 19.7 66.8 10.6 170.7 27.2 195.1 31.1 \n\nPercentages are calculated for coastal segments total length.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 20 \n\nClass 2: Impacted and Prograding Open Sandy Beaches \n\nClass 2 includes Cassino and Quer\u00eancia beaches, an 11-km long shoreline (1.7% of the \n\nstate shorelines) south of the Rio Grande jetty. This 4-km long jetty obstructs the longshore \n\nsediment transport to the north, prograding the updrift beaches. Cassino is the largest and most \n\nimportant beach in the southern coast, having about 40,000 permanent residents, many left the \n\ncity to live in their former summerhouses evidencing the new trend on coastal development in the \n\nstate. Developed shores comprise about 47% of the class length (Table 2.1) and consist mainly in \n\none-store houses and few small buildings (up to four stores) placed behind the dune fields. \n\nAlthough the shore is prograding, dunes have been decreasing in size and often show storm \n\nscarps. In the urbanized area, dune fixation and reconstruction have been implemented.  \n\nPeriodically, muddy deposits originated from the suspended matter of the Patos Lagoon \n\ndischarge cover the swash zone and part of the backshore, changing the morphodynamic \n\nconditions of this sandy shore. Such events have been registered since 1901, before the \n\nconstruction of the jetties, and the influence of human activities to this process in recent years \n\nstill needs to be quantified. \n\nTraffic on the beach is constant and very intense in summer months as beach dwellers \n\npark their cars near the swash zone forming a long and continuos line along more than 10 km. \n\nLocal government is willing to place a road in the dune area to facilitate car access to the beach. \n\nUrbanized dune areas are observed in Quer\u00eancia and some old buildings were abandoned as \n\ndunes invaded them. There are not sewage treatment plants and many domestic effluents \n\ndischarge into the creeks that flow to the beach, polluting water and sand mainly in the summer \n\nwhen more houses are occupied. Additionally, the presence of the long jetties results in a \n\nshoreline 100% altered (Table 2.1). \n\n \n\nClass 3: Developed and Mainly Eroding Beaches  \n\n About 129.6 km of the state shorelines are included in Class 3, comprising highly \n\nurbanized (nearly 80% of its length) and altered (78%) beaches (Table 2.1). Urbanized dune \n\nareas are observed along 42% of this class shoreline length (or about half of its developed \n\nshores). There are three coastal segments in this class: (a) Northern, a 126-km long segment \n\nlimited by Itapeva (Torres) in the north and Dunas Altas (Palmares do Sul) in the south, (b) \n\nHermenegildo, a 2.5-km long urbanized beach located at the southern coast, about 12 km north \n\nof the border with Uruguay, and (c) Chu\u00ed, a small beach village (0.9-km long shoreline) at the \n\nsouthernmost end of the state, limited south by the Chu\u00ed jetty that has fixed the former migrating \n\nChu\u00ed inlet which marks the Uruguayan border.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 21 \n \n\nFigure 2.3. Pictures show examples of beachfront development in RS beaches. (a) Praia da Guarita (Torres) \n\nshow the rocky headlands observed in the northernmost coastal sector (Class 1). (b) Single-family beachfront \n\nproperties placed behind the dunes are the dominant type of urbanized shores in RS (Class 3). (c) Hard \n\nengineering structures are observed protecting houses built on top of the dunes mainly in the south of the \n\nnorthern sector (photo) and in Hermenegildo (Class 3). (d) An increasing problem has been small and wooden \n\nshacks built illegally on dune areas, as observed in Pinhal (Class 3). (e) Cap\u00e3o da Canoa represents the highly \n\nurbanized beaches of the area between Cap\u00e3o Novo and Tramanda\u00ed in the northern sector (Class 3). (f) Armored \n\nbeachfront houses built on top of dunes in Hermenegildo have been threatened by wave attack and storm surges \n\nduring storms (Class 3). (g) Undeveloped open sandy beaches dominate along 76% of the state shoreline (Class \n\n4). (h) In some of the small beach villages present along the undeveloped central sector, houses were built on \n\npilings to minimize the damages caused by migrating dunes (Class 4). \n\n\n\n 22 \n\nThe Northern segment is the longest developed coastal segment and concentrates the \n\ngreat majority of the state coastal urban centers. Approximately 79% of its shoreline length is \n\nurbanized (Table 2.1), and the undeveloped shores usually consist in short sections (of about 0.3 \n\nto 0.5 km) that mark the limit between adjacent developed beaches. Beachfront development \n\nusually consists in one-family (one or two-store) houses placed behind the dunes. Thus, coastal \n\nurban areas consist mainly of small beach villages that have a very small permanent population \n\nand are occupied only in the summer months, except for few larger cities, such as Cap\u00e3o da \n\nCanoa and Tramanda\u00ed.  These urban centers concentrate most of the services offered through out \n\nthe year as they have a larger permanent population, and have shown an accelerated population \n\ngrowth in the last decade. \n\nSeveral human-induced changes have been associated to urbanization: removal of the \n\ndunes to give place to beachfront properties, roads, and other facilities, pollution from domestic \n\neffluents, closure of natural washouts and creeks, and shore armoring. As a result, dunes are less \n\ndeveloped or completely removed in urban areas, while undeveloped areas still show well-\n\ndeveloped dunes. Revegetated dunes are observed in 37% of this shoreline, mainly as \n\nlandscaping or in dune fixation and reconstruction works (i.e. Imb\u00e9 and Atl\u00e2ntida Sul). Probably, \n\nanthropic changes, in addition to natural processes, have caused a negative sand balance that is \n\nevident in the areas where stormy conditions threatened coastal constructions placed on the \n\ndunes, such as in Cidreira and Pinhal (Figure 2.3c, d).  \n\nAt the northern urbanized compartment, it is possible to further distinguish three \n\nsegments according to the distribution and distance between developed beaches and the quality \n\nand location of beachfront properties. North of Cap\u00e3o Novo there are long undeveloped sections \n\nseparating urbanized beaches, so this is the least developed shore in this segment. Probably, the \n\ngreater distance from the metropolitan area of Porto Alegre (the state\u2019s capital) is the main factor \n\nthat restrains occupation in this area. Beachfront properties are usually nice single-family houses \n\n(medium class) built behind the dune area (Figure 2.3b), resulting in the least altered section of \n\nthis segment and more organized beach villages. The southernmost segment (Cidreira to the \n\nsouth) presents the most chaotic beachfront occupation. Beachfront properties were built on the \n\ntop of the dunes and have been threatened by erosion during storms, leading to the \n\nimplementation of protection structures, such as seawalls and revetments (Figure 2.3c). Some of \n\nthe developed dune areas consist in small and poor wooden shacks illegally built (Figure \n\n2.3d).This sector is about 80 km from Porto Alegre and presently has many permanent residents \n\nthat left the metropolitan area to live by the sea. The central sector (from Cap\u00e3o Novo to Nova \n\nTramanda\u00ed) consists in the most developed shores in the RS (Figure 2.3e). Beachfront properties \n\nconsist in fancy multi-family resorts, high buildings, and high standard single-family houses. \n\nAlong most of this shoreline, dunes were totally removed to give place to boardwalks or houses, \n\n\n\n 23 \n\nfood and drink facilities were built on the beach, and storm surges frequently threaten coastal \n\nconstructions. Probably, the road built about ten years ago to link the beaches at the northern \n\ncoast to the highway that starts in Porto Alegre contributed to the fast growing coastal cities in \n\nthis area. \n\nThe other two segments consist in the urbanized shores of Hermenegildo and Chu\u00ed that \n\nare 2.5 km and 0.9 km long, respectively, inserted in the mainly undeveloped southern segment. \n\nThey are 100% altered and urbanized beaches, mainly due to the presence of hard engineering \n\nstructures in the armored shore of Hermenegildo and the jetty in the Chu\u00ed inlet. Beachfront \n\nproperties in Hermenegildo were built on top of the dunes and have been threatened by erosion \n\n(Figure 2.3f), resembling the problems observed in the northern segment south of Cidreira. As a \n\nresult, its shoreline is heavily armored as 61% of beachfront houses are protected (ESTEVES et \n\nal., 1999). Storms frequently destroy coastal structures and people in Hermenegildo are already \n\nused to the endless cycle of rebuilding houses and structures year after year. In the other hand, \n\nalthough Chu\u00ed beach is located downdrift of the stabilized Chu\u00ed inlet, it is not experiencing a \n\nsignificant shoreline retreat, probably due to the short extension of the jetty. Additionally, the \n\npresence of a pleistocenic sandy barrier (locally known as Barrier III) near the shore might have \n\nsome influence in the shoreline change rates as it supplies sand to adjacent beaches. \n\n \n\nClass 4: Undeveloped Open Sandy Beaches \n\nUndeveloped exposed beaches are the dominant coastal environment in the RS, \n\ncomprising about 478 km (76%) of the state shoreline (Table 2.1). They are mainly fine sand \n\nbeaches with vegetated frontal dunes that have not been impacted by human activities (Figure \n\n2.3g). About 2% (10.4 km) of its shoreline is sparsely urbanized due to small fishing villages that \n\nare mainly built on the dunes. The impacted sections in this class consist in urbanized dune areas, \n\nthe presence of Pinus sp. forests for commercial harvesting too close to the beach (sometimes in \n\nthe dunes), and areas close to the urban centers of Class 2 and 3, totaling 16.2% of the 478.4 km \n\n(Table 2.1).  \n\nThis class presents three segments: (a) the state\u2019s central coastal sector, a 266-km long \n\nshoreline from the East jetty at the Patos Lagoon inlet to Dunas Altas in the north, (b) southeast, \n\n200 km of shorelines from Quer\u00eancia to Hermenegildo, and (c) southern, the 12.4 km of beaches \n\nin between Hermenegildo and Chu\u00ed. The central coastal segment presents the majority of the \n\nurbanized shores in this class that are mainly fishing villages. In some of these villages, \n\nmigrating dunes invade the houses that have been built on pilings to minimize the damages \n\n(Figure 2.3h). In the southeast segment, beach traffic south of Quer\u00eancia and Pinus sp. \n\nafforestations are the main human impacts. About 15 km south of Quer\u00eancia, there is a 21-km \n\n\n\n 24 \n\nlong shoreline where dunes are well developed although they are discontinuous due to the \n\npresence of sand plains associated to large washouts. The southern segment is similar to the other \n\ntwo and presents one small village built up on the dunes. \n\nShorelines in Class 4 consist in long segments that are still undeveloped, mainly due to \n\nthe long distance from inland urban centers and to the lack of roads. To most of these segments, \n\nthe only access is driving through the beach and, as it is an open shore, there are no natural \n\nharbors for recreational or fishing boats. However, a new paved road that will cross the central \n\nshores up to S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte linking these undeveloped shorelines to the northern urban \n\ncenters, might change the present unoccupied areas in the near future as new settlements will \n\nprobably be established.  \n\n \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nDevelopment along RS shorelines has been concentrated in the state northern coast, \n\nexcept for few urban areas and small fishing villages present in the southern and central coasts, \n\nrespectively. Probably, the distance from larger inland urban centers and the facility of road \n\naccess to the coast are the main factors contributing to the differences in development level along \n\nthe state shorelines. The northern coast is close to the most densely populated areas of the state \n\n(the northeast region and Porto Alegre metropolitan area) and has the best roads. Access to the \n\ncentral coast, south of Quint\u00e3o to S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte, is very difficult as there are only two ways, \n\ndriving on the beach or through the BR101, called the \u201c Hell\u2019s Road\u201d  along this part of the RS \n\ncoast. It was an uneven dirty road almost impossible to be crossed, mainly after rainfalls. In the \n\nlast two years, BR101 started to be paved and soon it will be connecting the beaches up to S\u00e3o \n\nJos\u00e9 do Norte. It means that the paved road will facilitate access in a north-south direction \n\nthrough an almost completely undeveloped 270-km long shoreline. This shoreline consists in a \n\nsandy barrier that separates the Patos Lagoon from the Atlantic Ocean, so there is not east-west \n\nroad connection to the rest of the state. Part of this area belongs to the National Park of Lagoa do \n\nPeixe, an important rest site for migrating birds. Thus, a brand new paved road associated with \n\necological attractions (i.e. coastal lagoons, National Park) will result in more people visiting the \n\narea. Small villages soon will have to offer infrastructure and services, permanent and temporary \n\npopulation will grow, and the consequences of a chaotic development may devastate this \n\nsensitive area in few years.  \n\nAt present, situation on the southern coast is similar to the central coast. However, there \n\nis no evidence that in the near future it will be threatened by a development bloom as it is \n\nexpected in the central coast. Except for the urbanized shores of Cassino, Chu\u00ed, and \n\nHermenegildo, this coast is completely undeveloped, it is far away from any urban centers, and it \n\n\n\n 25 \n\ncan be reached only through the beach as there is no road access along about 200 km of \n\nshorelines. Due to the presence of large coastal lagoons (Mirim and Mangueira) and the small \n\npopulation in the southern region, characteristics along this shore might remain unchanged in the \n\nnear future. Possibly, the only change the southern coast may experience is related to the Port of \n\nRio Grande expansion. It is the third largest Brazilian port and the most important for the trade \n\nbetween MERCOSUL countries. The extension of both jetties (at present they are about 4-km \n\nlong) and the deepening of the navigation channel are already scheduled to allow larger ships to \n\nanchor. If the port expands as expected, it might result in an accelerated growth in Cassino Beach \n\nas it is very close to the industrial district and the port itself. \n\nAs most of the state shorelines are undeveloped, the better alternative is to implement \n\nmanagement policies according to the natural characteristics of specific coastal segments. For \n\nexample, the central coast has a great potential for ecological tourism related to the National Park \n\nof Lagoa do Peixe or recreational fishing, and the development of urban centers might reduce \n\nthis potential. Regulating future uses on undeveloped shores is the best and cheapest way of \n\nmanagement, as it will avoid problem areas to spread through the entire coast when they become \n\ndeveloped. Urbanized areas in the southern coast consist in short beach segments surrounded by \n\nlong undeveloped shorelines. Thus, management strategies there might differ from the ones \n\napplied to the northern highly urbanized shores. For example, relocation or planned retreated \n\nshould be evaluated as possible responses to the erosion problem in beaches such as \n\nHermenegildo, where beachfront properties are not worth an expensive protection measure and \n\nthere is enough undeveloped area either alongshore or inland. The same problem in the area from \n\nCap\u00e3o da Canoa to Tramanda\u00ed should be addressed in a different way as beachfront properties \n\nare worth to be protected and there is no room for relocation.  \n\nAltered shores are mainly associated to human activities. Coastal development did not \n\nleave much space for the natural beach dynamics to take place; as a consequence, in several \n\nplaces it has been threatened by high-energy waves and storm surges during storms (Figure 2.3). \n\nShore armoring, fixation of coastal dunes, and sand mining probably have contributed to a sand \n\ndeficit in RS beaches. The artificial closure of natural washouts might be another anthropogenic \n\nchange that tampers with local sand balance. In many coastal communities, washouts were \n\nartificially closed for road construction and tend to reopen temporarily during storms or high \n\nrainfall events, destroying nearby constructions. Coastal debris, fishing refuse, and city litter are \n\nobserved along the entire RS coast. Surprisingly, debris (brought by natural washouts or by storm \n\nwaves) causes a greater visual impact along unoccupied beaches, as along most of developed \n\nshorelines they are periodically cleaned. However, in the summer months, domestic effluents \n\ndischarge a large amount of sewage in natural creeks that cross dunes and beach resulting in \n\npolluted sand and water along the highly urbanized areas. ISLA et al. (1998) presented a review \n\n\n\n 26 \n\nof erosion problems caused or aggravated by stabilization of coastal dunes and concluded that \n\nfixation of dunes contributed to shoreline retreat in their study area. In the same way, growth of \n\ncommercial woodlands in dune areas was considered a condition of human-induced alteration, \n\nalthough its contribution to the coastal sand deficit is still unknown. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nAccording to the natural characteristics and human impacts, the RS shores can be \n\ngrouped into four classes: (1) beaches under the influence of rocky headlands, (2) impacted and \n\nprograding beaches, (3) developed and mainly eroding beaches, and (4) undeveloped open \n\nbeaches. Class 1 consists in the beaches of Torres (8.4 km), the only place where rocky \n\nheadlands are observed. These beaches are developed and human-activities have impacted most \n\nof its shoreline that has shown a trend to accretion. Class 2 includes the urbanized and highly \n\naltered area of Cassino Beach (10.9 km), an open sandy beach that has been accreting due to the \n\npresence of a long jetty that obstructs the longshore sediment transport. Class 3 is a 129.6-km \n\nlong shore segment comprised by developed sandy beaches that have been intensely altered due \n\nto human activities. Class 4 includes the undeveloped and least impacted sandy beaches that \n\nrepresent 76% of the state shoreline length.  \n\nIn general, the state coast is mostly undeveloped except along one-fifth of its length, \n\nconcentrated in the north where urban areas have the fastest growing populations in the state. \n\nDespite the long and undeveloped coastal segments, almost one-third of the state shorelines have \n\nbeen impacted by human activities, such as urbanization, constructions on the dunes, sand \n\nremoval from the beaches and dunes, and commercial woodlands. Beaches in Class 3 represent \n\nwhat might be the consequences if fast growing coastal development continues in the same \n\nchaotic and unplanned way through the undeveloped areas. In the other hand, the long and \n\nundeveloped shore segments are a perfect environment for the application of a successful coastal \n\nmanagement plan that will guide land uses and occupation and avoid the same critical problems \n\nobserved in coastal urban centers at present. \n\n \n\nLITERATURE CITED \n\nBARLETTA, R.C.; CALLIARI, L.J., TOZZI, H.A.M., and PIVEL, M.A.G., 1999.

Long- and short-\n\nterm coastal erosion in southern Brazil. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 36, 273-282. \n\n\n\n 29 \n\nABSTRACT \n\nRio Grande do Sul is the southernmost state in Brazil. Open sandy beaches dominate the \n\n630-km long shoreline that is 76% still undeveloped. Less than 5% of the state\u2019 s population \n\n(totalling 9.7 million people) live in coastal cities. However, the coastal population is growing \n\nfaster than the state\u2019 s average since 1990. Although intense erosion is widely accepted along the \n\nbeaches of Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse and Hermenegildo, the extent of erosion along the Rio Grande \n\ndo Sul shoreline is still a controversial issue. Discussions arise from the contrasting results \n\npresented by studies addressing coastal erosion in Rio Grande do Sul. Recent DGPS monitoring \n\nindicates that about 80% of the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline is eroding; wave refraction studies \n\nindicate that it is mainly stable, and long-term coastal evolution modeling reveals a dominantly \n\nprograding shore for the last 5 ka. This work critically evaluates published data on long- and \n\nshort-term causes of coastal erosion in Rio Grande do Sul, in an attempt to highlight the \n\nunanswered questions that could minimize the debate. The analysis includes sea-level rise, \n\nconcentration of wave energy due to large-scale coastal topography, sand deficit as the long-term \n\ncauses of erosion; storm surges, concentration of wave energy due to small-scale submerged \n\nfeatures, interference in the longshore sediment transport, and human activities as the short-term \n\ncauses. Discrepancies in shoreline change results are a matter of the temporal scale in question \n\nand what are the causes that play a significant role on it. For coastal management purposes short-\n\ntime events represent a far greater hazard than long-term trends. It is therefore reasonable to state \n\nthat in order to support decision-making mechanisms in Rio Grande do Sul, a better \n\nunderstanding of the relationship of storms, sand budget, and beach erosion is necessary. \n\n \n\nAdditional Index Words: Shoreline change, beach erosion, coastal evolution, Rio Grande do Sul \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nRio Grande do Sul is the southernmost state in Brazil (Figure 3.1) and its 630-km long \n\nshoreline is one of the least-developed in the country. In 1999, about 430,000 people were living \n\nin coastal cities, representing 4.4% of the state\u2019 s population (9.9 million). However, the coastal \n\npopulation has grown about 1.5% per year since 1991 with six of the ten cities that had the \n\ngreatest population growth in the last decade situated on the coast. Thus, a new trend of coastal \n\noccupation is evident and undeveloped areas will probably give way to new settlements in the \n\nnear future. To avoid unplanned development along hazardous coastal segments, it is necessary \n\nto identify such areas and to understand the effects and interactions of coastal processes in \n\ndifferent time scales, particularly those related to shoreline changes. \n\n\n\n 30 \n\nAs the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline is mainly undeveloped (except for the northern \n\nsector) and beaches are used only in the summer months when calm weather prevails, coastal \n\nstudies have not attracted the attention of community, government, or indeed researchers until \n\nrecently. Only in the late 1980s, published works started to focus on coastal processes, including \n\nthose addressing beach erosion in Rio Grande do Sul (VILLWOCK and TOMAZELLI, 1989; \n\nTOMAZELLI, 1990); before that, articles on coastal studies were mainly descriptive. Since then, \n\nseveral studies have addressed coastal erosion in Rio Grande do Sul indicating natural and \n\nhuman-induced contributing factors in the long-term (i.e. TOMAZELLI et al., 1998; \n\nTOMAZELLI and DILLENBURG, 1998; DILLENBURG et al., 2000) and the short-term (i.e. \n\nCALLIARI et al., 1998a,b; ESTEVES et al., 2000a; TOLDO et al., 1999). The increasing \n\ninterest in coastal processes and shoreline changes reflects the intensification of coastal \n\noccupation and beach use, as well as the growing economic importance of beach-related tourism. \n\nAlthough knowledge about coastal processes in southern Brazil is improving, it is still incipient, \n\nand many unsolved issues need to be addressed. At present, there is an ongoing discussion on \n\nwhether the Rio Grande do Sul shore is mainly eroding, prograding or stable.  \n\nFigure 3.1. The study area consists in the 630-km long shoreline of Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost \n\nstate of Brazil. \n\n\n\n 31 \n\nThis paper compiles available shoreline change data at different time scales, critically \n\nanalysing them to help direct which logical step should be taken in the study of coastal changes \n\nin the state. Additionally, present shoreline monitoring results are discussed in an attempt to \n\nestablish the present extension of beach erosion or at least identify shoreline change trends in Rio \n\nGrande do Sul.  \n\n \n\nSTUDY AREA \n\nThe Rio Grande do Sul shore is part of a large coastal plain that extends between the \n\ngranitic headlands of Cabo Polonio (Uruguay) in the south and Cape Santa Marta in the north. It \n\nis remarkable the presence of a well developed lagoon system formed by two large ones (Mirim \n\nin the south and Patos in the middle coastal sector) and several small others in the northern \n\nlittoral. The Rio Grande do Sul shoreline is 630-km long mainly consisting of exposed fine sandy \n\nbeaches that have a NE-SW general orientation. It is one of the longest sandy beach coastlines in \n\nthe world, made up of only two permanent discontinuities (Tramanda\u00ed and Patos lagoon inlets). \n\nInnumerous permanent and temporary washouts discharge water accumulated behind the dunes, \n\ninfluencing the local sand balance. \n\nWaves are the main hydrodynamic process along the Rio Grande do Sul coast, as the \n\nmaximum tidal variation is less than 0.5 m (TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). Winds from NE prevail \n\nand are mainly active during summer and spring; southerly winds are the strongest and more \n\nfrequent during winter and fall. As southerly waves have higher energy, the net longshore \n\nsediment transport is to the north. Mean significant wave height is 1.5 m and mean period is 9 s. \n\nStorms associated to the passage of cold fronts frequently strike the coast in fall and winter \n\nmonths, mainly April and July (CALLIARI et al., 1998b). \n\nGenerally, the Rio Grande do Sul coast can be subdivided into three sectors: (1) the \n\nnorthern sector comprised of 136 km of developed beaches extending from Torres (at the state \n\nborder) to Dunas Altas in the south; (2) the central sector, 266-km long and includes the \n\nundeveloped beaches from Dunas Altas to the Patos Lagoon inlet, and (3) the southern sector  \n\nmade up of the shoreline from the Patos Lagoon inlet to the Chu\u00ed creek (at the border with \n\nUruguay), a 225-km long shoreline with only 7.6 km of urbanized beaches (ESTEVES et al., \n\n2000b).  \n\nWell-sorted fine quartz sands dominate in the Rio Grande do Sul beaches (MARTINS, \n\n1967), except in three areas: (1) south of the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Lighthouse (central sector), where mean \n\nsizes are coarser and less sorted due to the presence of shell fragments; (2) in Cassino Beach, fine \n\nsediments from the Patos Lagoon cause a slightly decrease in the mean size, and (3) between \n\n\n\n 32 \n\nAlbard\u00e3o lighthouse and Hermenegildo (southern sector) there is a 30-km long segment \n\n(Concheiros do Albard\u00e3o) that presents bimodal sediments composed by quartzose fine sands \n\nand bioclastic gravel (SIEGLE, 1996; CALLIARI and KLEIN, 1993). Morphodynamically, \n\nbeaches vary from intermediate to dissipative stages, except along Concheiros do Albard\u00e3o \n\nwhich was classified as reflective to intermediate according to CALLIARI and KLEIN (1993). \n\n \n\nQUATERNARY COASTAL EVOLUTION \n\nThe geologic evolution of the Rio Grande do Sul coastal plain was described by \n\nVILLWOCK et al. (1986) and detailed in several following studies (i.e. VILLWOCK and \n\nTOMAZELLI, 1989, 1998; TOMAZELLI et al., 2000). As the Quaternary coastal evolution was \n\na key factor for the present shoreline configuration, this section summarizes the main findings of \n\nthose studies.   \n\nThe coastal plain comprises two major depositional systems formed by sea-level \n\nfluctuations in the Quaternary: the alluvial fan deposits that mark the western limit of the coastal \n\nplain and the barrier-lagoon systems developed seawards (TOMAZELLI et al., 2000). The \n\nalluvial fan system consists of coarse-grained clastic deposits (gravel, sand, and mud) originated \n\nfrom gravity flows and accumulated at the base of highlands (sedimentary and volcanic rocks of \n\nthe Paran\u00e1 Basin to the north and the igneous and metamorphic rocks of the Precambrian shield \n\nin the south). Formation of these deposits probably dates from the late Pliocene regression to the \n\nHolocene and was controlled by climate changes. Arid periods might have intensified the \n\nformation of gravity flows, while water flows during the humid phases reworked the conical \n\nshape of individual fans into a continuous apron gently dipping seaward. Deposits at the edge of \n\ncoalescent fans were eroded by higher sea levels in the Pleistocene resulting in marine and \n\nlagoon terraces that are particularly well developed and preserved to the south. \n\nFour barrier-lagoon depositional systems were identified in the Rio Grande do Sul \n\ncoastal plain, each representing the sedimentary record of a marine transgression, three during \n\nthe Pleistocene and one in the Holocene (Figure 3.1). Each barrier represents the landward limit \n\nof the respective maximum transgressive event (VILLWOCK and TOMAZELLI, 1998; \n\nTOMAZELLI et al., 2000). VILLWOCK et al. (1986) named the four barrier-lagoon systems as \n\nBarrier I (the oldest) to IV (the youngest). Absolute ages of the pleistocene barriers are still \n\nunknown (TOMAZELLI et al., 2000). An attempt to correlate the last major peaks of the oxygen \n\nisotopic record and barrier formation indicates that they were probably formed in the last 400 ka \n\n(TOMAZELLI et al., 2000). Barrier I, II, and III correlate with oxygen isotopic stage 11 (about \n\n400 ka), stage 9 (325 ka), and sub-stage 5e (approximately 125 ka), respectively. Barrier IV was \n\nformed in the Holocene and corresponds to oxygen isotopic stage 1. About 18 ka ago, sea level \n\n\n\n 33 \n\nwas near the present shelf break and rose steadily up to 2-4 m above the present level at the \n\nmaximum of the last transgression (about 5 ka BP). The following regression favoured the \n\nprogradation of Barrier IV through the formation of beach/foredune ridges that were mainly \n\ndeveloped in the smooth embayments in between Torres and Tramanda\u00ed and in Rio Grande \n\n(TOMAZELLI and DILLENBURG, 1998). The onshore sand transfer from the shelf was the \n\nmain source for barrier progradation, as fluvial sands were retained in the lagoon system. \n\nFigure 3.1 shows the location of the preserved barrier deposits. Barrier I is preserved in \n\nthe northwestern part of the coastal plain as a 150 km-long and 10-km wide strip of aeolian sands \n\nat the top of basement highs. Barrier II is better preserved to the south, where it was responsible \n\nfor the initial formation of the Mirim lagoon. Barrier III is preserved along most of the coastal \n\nplain extension and is formed by beach deposits covered by aeolian sands, demonstrating its \n\nregressive nature. Its beach deposits are rich in Callichirus sp. burrows, indicating an ancient \n\nhigh sea level at 6-8 m above the present. The Pleistocene lagoon systems (I, II, and III) \n\ndeveloped in between the respective barrier (I, II, or III) and mainland (the previous barrier or the \n\nalluvial fan deposits). Barrier IV consists in the present shore deposits. The large lagoon system \n\nwas developed in between Barrier IV and Barrier III at the maximum Holocene transgressive \n\nevent. However, the last marine regression favoured the infilling of some lagoons that have \n\nevolved into lakes, swamps and floodplains. \n\n \n\nEVIDENCE OF BEACH EROSION \n\nThe extent of erosion along Rio Grande do Sul beaches is a controversial issue. Some \n\nstudies suggest that most of the coast is stable (i.e. CALLIARI et al., 2000) and others indicate \n\nthat it is mainly eroding (i.e. TOMAZELLI et al., 1998; TOLDO et al., 1999; ESTEVES et al., \n\n2001). However, intense erosion is widely accepted at the localities of Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse and \n\nHermenegildo beach (CALLIARI et al., 1998a, 2000; TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). \n\nBack-barrier lagoonal deposits and peat have been exposed at the beach along (a) the \n\nnorthern developed coastal sector in Jardim do \u00c9den, (b) for more than 60 km continuously along \n\nthe undeveloped shorelines of the central sector (in front and adjacent to Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse), \n\nand (c) in Hermenegildo beach in the southern sector (TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). These \n\nlagoonal deposits show radiocarbon ages of 5.76 ka in Jardim do \u00c9den (DILLENBURG, 1994), \n\n3.49 ka close to Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse (DILLENBURG, personal communication), and 4.33 ka in \n\nHermenegildo (TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). \n\nForedune scarps in front of the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse have retreated in an average rate of \n\n2.5 m/yr in the period 1975-1995 (TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). The analysis of beach profiles \n\n\n\n 34 \n\nfrom 1996 to 1999 shows an average retreat rate of 3.6 m/yr for the same area and 1 m/yr for \n\nLagamarzinho beach, about 70 km north of Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse (BARLETTA and CALLIARI, \n\n2000). This lighthouse actually fell under wave attack during a storm in 1993. Destruction of \n\ncoastal structures during storms has been a strong source of evidence of erosion in \n\nHermenegildo. Beachfront owners have built seawalls and revetments to protect their properties \n\nfrom wave attacks and storm surges and yet have seen destruction not only of the armouring but \n\nalso of the houses that were supposedly protected (ESTEVES et al., 2000a).  \n\n \n\nLONG-TERM CAUSES OF EROSION \n\nRelative Sea-level Rise \n\nGeomorphological, sedimentological, and geochronological available data indicate that a \n\nsea-level fall has promoted progradation of the Rio Grande do Sul coast since the maximum of \n\nthe last post-glacial marine transgression. Sea-level curves established for the Brazilian coast \n\nshow a marine regression for the last 5 ka (SUGUIO et al., 1985; ANGULO and LESSA, 1997). \n\nHowever, according to TOMAZELLI et al. (1998), the relative sea-level trend might have \n\nreversed at some point when progradation stopped and coastal retreat started. Although there is \n\nnot enough data to build a consistent Holocene sea-level curve for the Rio Grande do Sul, the \n\nauthors support their idea making an interesting statement that in this paper will be posed as a \n\nquestion. Where are the barrier deposits that associated with the (lagoon) peat and organic mud \n\nlayers exposed at the present shoreline? Additionally, they conclude that short-term erosion due \n\nto storms is significant but can only result in long-term shoreline retreat if superimposed onto a \n\nlonger-term mechanism, such as a sea-level rise. \n\nThe hypothesis of a rising sea level along the Rio Grande do Sul coast would be in \n\nagreement with the global trend of an eustatic rise in the order of about 1-2 mm/yr (e.g. \n\nDOUGLAS, 1991). Unfortunately, a long-term record of tidal levels along the Rio Grande do Sul \n\ncoast does not exist. The nearest longer tidal record is from Puerto Quequ\u00e9n (Argentina), from \n\nwhere 64 years (1918-1981) of hourly tidal levels were analysed resulting in an average relative \n\nrise of 1.6 \u00b1 0.1 mm/yr (LANFREDI et al., 1998). Considering that this coast is part of a passive \n\nmargin and there are no neotectonic movements, it is likely that the relative sea level is similar to \n\nthe global trend. In the other hand, three studies show evidence that may conflict with this \n\ntheory: the possibility of neotectonic activities in the Rio Grande do Sul during the Quaternary \n\n(FONSECA et al., 2001), and vermetid tubes 14C datings for nearby states which show a \n\ncontinuous regression for the last 5 ka with no evidence of levels below the present (ANGULO \n\nand LESSA, 1997; ANGULO et al., 2001). \n\n\n\n 35 \n\nConcentration of Wave Energy Due To Large-Scale Coastal Topography \n\nShoreline configuration contributes to variations in the distribution of wave energy along \n\nthe coast in a macro-scale (TOMAZELLI and DILLENBURG, 1998). Applying a coastal \n\nevolution model, DILLENBURG et al. (2000) suggested that antecedent topography was a key-\n\nfactor for the definition of the present Rio Grande do Sul coastal shape that in turn have \n\ncontrolled the type of barrier that was developed. Steeper topography resulted in coastal \n\nprojections and milder gradients originated embayments. Thus, concentration of wave energy in \n\nlarge protruding shore segments favoured development of retrogradational barriers, while \n\nprogradational barriers were formed in smooth embayments. This mechanism explains why \n\nsedimentary records of progradation are evident only in parts of the coast and not evenly \n\nFigure 3.2. Shoreline changes in the southern RS littoral based on: (A) shoreline variations between 1975-\n\n2000 (ESTEVES et al., 2001), (B) concentration of wave energy due to short-term storm events (CALLIARI \n\net al., 2000), and (C) concentration of wave energy due to large-scale coastal topography (DILLENBURG et \n\nal., 2000). Arrows (D) show direction of littoral drift, and variations of longshore transport rates (as estimated \n\nby ALMEIDA et al., 2001) are indicated by changes in arrows width. \n\n\n\n 36 \n\ndistributed, as it should be if a change in sea level was the only cause of shoreline changes. \n\nClassification of long-term shoreline changes based on DILLENBURG et al. (2000) is displayed \n\nin Figures 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. Progradational barriers occur along about 40% of the state\u2019 s coast, \n\nreceded barriers along 34%, and 26% are classified as stable barriers. \n\n \n\nSand Deficit \n\nThe Rio Grande do Sul coast presents two large lagoons along the central (Patos lagoon) \n\nand southern coastal sectors (Mirim lagoon) and several other small lagoons and lakes along the \n\nnorthern littoral. This lagoon system traps sediment from fluvial discharge, reducing the sand \n\nvolume reaching the shore (TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). As such conditions exist since the \n\nformation of Barrier IV (last 5 ka), inland sand did not contribute to barrier growth. Two sources \n\nprovided sand for progradation in the embayments: erosion of existing coastal landforms and \n\nonshore transport from the shelf. In the last 5 ka, the sand budget on the Rio Grande do Sul coast \n\nhas been controlled by alongshore gradients of wave energy resulting from the concentration of \n\nFigure 3.3. Shoreline changes in the central RS littoral based on: (A) shoreline variations between 1975-2000 \n\n(ESTEVES et al., 2001), (B) concentration of wave energy due to short-term storm events (CALLIARI et al., \n\n2000), and (C) concentration of wave energy due to large-scale coastal topography (DILLENBURG et al., \n\n2000).

Thus, a link between \n\ncoastal morphology, wave energy gradients, and imbalances on sand budget is evident. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4.

In southern Brazil, they occur when S-SE winds force water onshore during \n\nthe passage of intense cold fronts (forming cyclogenesis). Although storm surges are about 1-m \n\nhigh along the Rio Grande do Sul coast, the higher water level intensifies the erosive capacity of \n\nstorm waves, causing severe damage at the coast mainly when coincident with high spring tides \n\n(CALLIARI et al., 1998b). This catastrophic combination is more frequent in April and May and \n\nis more destructive the longer it lasts (CALLIARI et al., 1998b). It is also known that the \n\nfrequency of storms is a factor that influences beach erosion.  \n\nStudies addressing the occurrence and impact of storm surges in Brazil are scarce and \n\nlimited to the monitoring of individual events. A few examples are the storms of July 14, 1993 \n\nand April 19-21, 1995 (CALLIARI et al., 1998b), April 3-5 and 24-26, 1997 (BARLETTA et al., \n\n1999), and April 16, 1999 (ESTEVES et al., 2000a). The 1993 and the 1999 storms were very \n\nsimilar and consisted of extratropical cyclones formed after the passage of a cold front striking \n\nthe Rio Grande do Sul coast with average wind velocities of about 75 km/h, resulting in a storm \n\nsurge of 1.3 m and 0.8 m (measured at the Rio Grande Port), respectively. Beach profile \n\nmeasurements showed that the 1993 and 1999 storms caused subaerial beach erosion in \n\nHermenegildo of up to 60 m3/m and 45 m3/m, respectively. TOZZI and CALLIARI (2000) \n\nobserved that maximum changes in sand volume occur when the first fall storms (from March to \n\nJune) erode the accreted profile built during the summer months (from December to March). \n\nAccording to Tozzi\u2019 s results, the storm of April 1999 was a typical example of the high-energy \n\nevents that threaten Hermenegildo at least once a year. From data presented in BRITTO and \n\nSARAIVA (1999), the number of cold fronts passages along the Rio Grande do Sul coast in the \n\nwinter months (June to August) from 1988 to 1998 varied from 6 to 14, with a mean of 10 for \n\nthat period. However, there is still a lack of studies that examine storm distribution and \n\nfrequency, related storm surges and beach profile responses in a longer term (i.e. do they fully \n\nrecover?). \n\n \n\nConcentration of Wave Energy Due to Submerged Small-Scale Features \n\nRecent studies have shown that convergence of wave rays due to refraction on small-\n\nscale changes in bathymetry concentrates wave energy along the coast and is a probable cause of \n\nerosion in the areas of Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse and Hermenegildo (CALLIARI et al., 1998a, 2000). \n\nAccording to these studies, convergence patterns in those two areas were identified for waves \n\nwith periods longer than 9 s approaching from SSE-SW while a divergent pattern is observed in \n\n\n\n 39 \n\nthe northern shores. SPERANSKI and CALLIARI (2000) suggest that wave \u2018focus\u2019  is the major \n\ncause of erosion in the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse area and in Hermenegildo. However, this \n\nmechanism could not explain erosion in Lagamarzinho, where BARLETTA and CALLIARI \n\n(2000) have estimated a retreat rate of 1m/yr. This \u2018unexplained\u2019  erosion indicates that other \n\nfactors are actively contributing to erosion along the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline. Distribution of \n\neroded, stable, and accreted shorelines according to the wave refraction patterns (CALLIARI et \n\nal., 2000) is presented in Figures 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. About 75% of the Rio Grande do Sul coast \n\nwould be stable, 15% under erosion, 2% accreting, and 8% show a variable response to wave \n\nrefraction. \n\n \n\nLongshore Sediment Transport \n\nSedimentary and geomorphologic evidences indicate that net longshore transport is \n\ntowards the north (i.e. accretion of beaches south of jetties). However, measures of longshore \n\ntransport rates are still lacking for the Rio Grande do Sul coast. A recent study applied the \n\nEnergy Flux Method (USACE, 1984) to estimate the potential littoral drift based on wave \n\nmeasurements in deep water (ALMEIDA et al., 2001). Results indicate that the highest rates \n\noccur in the areas where intense erosion was observed. While the average rate for other coastal \n\nsectors is about 700,000 m3/yr, they are in the order of 1.8 million m3/yr from Hermenegildo to \n\nAlbard\u00e3o lighthouse and 1.6 million m3/yr from Cassino Beach to Solid\u00e3o lighthouse \n\n(ALMEIDA et al., 2001). Thus, highest longshore transport rates are expected along the most \n\nintensely eroded beaches in the state, as can be observed in figures 3.2 and 3.3.  \n\nAccording to the results of ALMEIDA et al. (2001), it is evident that shoreline \n\norientation has an important role on the littoral drift along the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline, \n\nwhere the highest rates occur in the southern half of coastal projections (shoreline orientation \n\nclose to N45\u00b0E). Thus, long-term erosion in coastal projections may have resulted from higher \n\nwave energy due to wave focusing and steeper gradients, as pointed by DILLENBURG et al. \n\n(2000), and also due to appropriate angles of wave attack.  \n\n \n\nHuman Activities \n\nDespite the long and undeveloped coastal segments, almost one-third of the state \n\nshorelines have been impacted by human activities, such as urbanisation in active dune areas, \n\nshore armouring, sand mining, and construction of jetties (ESTEVES et al., 2000b). \n\nAnthropogenic changes might be affecting local sand balance in a way that intensifies natural \n\nshoreline changes. For example, fixation of the Patos lagoon inlet by two 4-km long jetties \n\n\n\n 40 \n\nresulted in accelerated accretion of the southern beaches due to obstruction of the longshore \n\nsediment transport. This coastal sector has shown long-term progradation (DILLENBURG et al., \n\n2000). In Hermenegildo, urbanization in the active beach/dune system and coastal armouring \n\nappears to have aggravated erosion along a long-term retreating shoreline. Coastal development \n\ndid not leave much space for natural beach dynamics to take place, which has increased the risk \n\nof structural damage during storms (e.g. Cidreira, Pinhal, Hermenegildo). The artificial closure of \n\nnatural washouts might be another anthropogenic change that interferes with the local sediment \n\nbalance. In many coastal communities, washouts were artificially closed for road construction \n\nand tend to reopen temporarily during high rainfall events. Sand from the dune/beach system has \n\nbeen used for landfill and civil engineering purposes for a long time and, in some places, resulted \n\nin the removal of entire dunes. Although the impact of human activities on the sediment balance \n\nis still unknown, it seems to play a role largely at a local level, enhancing natural trends rather \n\nthan reversing them. \n\n \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nAccording to TOMAZELLI et al. (1998), TOLDO et al. (1999), and ESTEVES et al. \n\n(2001), the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline is mainly eroding. CALLIARI et al. (2000) has stated \n\nthat most of the Rio Grande do Sul coast is stable and does not show evidence of permanent \n\nnatural erosion. It is possible that all these studies are correct under certain aspects. Figures 3.2, \n\n3.3, and 3.4 display shoreline changes in the northern, central, and southern coastal sectors, \n\nrespectively, according to: (A) shoreline variations between 1975-2000 (ESTEVES et al., 2001), \n\n(B) concentration of wave energy due to short-term storm events (CALLIARI et al., 2000), and \n\n(C) concentration of wave energy due to large-scale coastal topography (DILLENBURG et al., \n\n2000). Additionally, it shows variation in the longshore transport rates (D) estimated by \n\nALMEIDA et al. (2001).  \n\nAlthough these studies represent short (A and B) and long-term (C) changes resulting \n\nfrom different variables, all have shown erosion along the shoreline of the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse \n\n(Figure 3.3) and Hermenegildo (Figure 3.4). There is also a reasonable agreement about the \n\nstable condition of a short segment north of Mostardas (Figure 3.3). Apart from that, results \n\ndiffer for one or all three studies, as in C the coast is dominantly prograding (40% of the \n\nshoreline length), in B is mainly stable (75%), and in A is mostly eroded (80%). These \n\ncontrasting results can be explained by the difference in time-scales and in the variables \n\nanalysed. Short-time oscillations can be superposed to long-term trends, masking them when \n\nonly few years of data are analysed. Thus, shorelines that have been prograding for thousands of \n\nyears may retreat in shorter intervals. In a life-long period, the effects of short-term events are \n\n\n\n 41 \n\neasily observed while long-term trends might not be evident, unless change rates are extremely \n\nhigh. In this time frame, variables with slower reaction times (glacioeustasy, tectonoeustay, \n\ngeoidal variations, isostasy) are not significant, leaving mainly hydrodynamic changes to be \n\nconsidered (FAIRBRIDGE, 1989). In the other hand, for longer-time intervals (e.g. 500 years), \n\nglacioeustasy and steric effects can cause a fluctuation of up to 30 cm in the sea level, besides the \n\neffects of isostasy (FAIRBRIDGE, 1989). Differences in the amplitude of changes caused by \n\neach variable in different time scales may explain the contrasting results of shoreline change \n\nstudies in Rio Grande do Sul. \n\nCoastal changes result from the interaction of several processes, natural and human, of \n\nlong and short duration. When major variables act in the same direction (accretion or erosion), \n\nthey enhance each others effects, then net variations are clearly identified. This is the probable \n\nscenario for the intensely eroded areas of Hermenegildo and Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse, where \n\nconcentration of the wave rays occur at a long-term receded barrier, the shoreline orientation is \n\nhighly susceptible to the southerly storm waves, and high longshore transport rates may be \n\ncontributing to a local sand deficit, in addition to a probable rise in sea level. In places where \n\nmajor factors operate in opposition to each other, changes are variable and are a function of the \n\ntime interval analysed. This might be the case for the northern coastal sector, where human \n\nactivities and a relative sea-level rise oppose to the spreading of wave energy along a long-term \n\nprograding shore. So, some factors can be of major importance to changes in some shorelines and \n\nbe indistinct in others. According to FAIRBRIDGE (1989), in places of adequate sand supply, \n\nwithout human interference, and where neotectonics is positive or neutral, beach equilibrium will \n\nbe maintained in a scenario of a mean sea-level rise as high as 5-10 mm/yr. In contrast, the same \n\nrise in sea level and neotectonic settings in a low-relief shore without adequate sand supply will \n\nresult in significant coastal retreat. This might be the case of the receded barriers developed \n\nalong the large-scale coastal projections simultaneously to the shore progradation along the \n\nembayments suggested for the last 5 ka in Rio Grande do Sul (DILLENBURG et al., 2000). \n\nShort-term shoreline changes affect beach uses and can be potentially destructive in \n\ndeveloped areas. Short-time events that last few days and have a frequent recurrence (within \n\nseveral months) represent a far greater hazard than long-term trends (FAIRBRIDGE, 1989). \n\nTherefore, knowledge of long-term trends is necessary to establish adequate coastal management \n\nplans, although they can only be efficient when maximum variations of short-term changes are \n\nproperly incorporated. For management purposes, much needs to be done to evaluate the \n\ninfluence of different causative factors in the short and long time frame. It is evident that storms \n\n(strong winds, high energy waves, and storm surges) erode Rio Grande do Sul beaches. \n\nHowever, how long beach profiles take to recover? Do storms cause long-term local negative \n\nsand balance? Is it true that destructive storms strike the Rio Grande do Sul coast once a year or \n\n\n\n 42 \n\nis that abnormally occurring only in the last years? How much sand is actually transported \n\nalongshore? Is sea level really rising in southern Brazil? If so, when did it start to rise and what \n\nare the rates? \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nAll studies indicate erosion of the beaches of Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse and Hermenegildo, \n\nwhile diverse results are observed along most of the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline. Where long- \n\nand short-term causes lead to shoreline changes to the same direction, the net result is evident at \n\nall temporal scales. However, in places where at least one variable results in movement to the \n\nopposite direction, the net variation is reduced and might not be observed in different time scales. \n\nThus, results obtained from shoreline change studies vary according to the temporal scale in \n\nquestion and the causes that are significant in that period. Although there is strong evidence of \n\nshort- and long-term erosion spread along the Rio Grande do Sul shore, more data is necessary to \n\ndefine and quantify shoreline change trends. For coastal management purposes short-time events \n\nrepresent a far greater hazard than long-term trends. Hence, it is necessary to better understand \n\nthe relationship between storms, sand budget, and beach erosion in Rio Grande do Sul to support \n\nproper decision-making processes. \n\n \n\nLITERATURE CITED \n\nALMEIDA, L.E.S.B.; LIMA, S.F., and TOLDO Jr., E.E., 2001.

Alongshore patterns of shoreline \n\nmovements in southern Brazil. Journal of Coastal Research, SI 39, (no prelo).\n\n\n\n \n\n 46 \n\n\n\n \n\n 47 \n\nABSTRACT \n\nRio Grande do Sul has a 630-km long shoreline dominated by mostly continuous, \n\nexposed sandy beaches that are often described as straight and homogeneous. From 1997 to \n\n2002, the state shoreline was mapped five times using the kinematic Global Positioning System \n\nmethod, showing regional differences in the dynamics of shoreline displacements. This study \n\ncompares short-term changes with long and medium-term trends in coastal evolution. Generally, \n\npatterns of annual shoreline displacements are distinct for the three coastal sectors. Similar \n\nmagnitudes and directions of changes occur along the southern sector, while displacements are to \n\nopposite directions in other areas. The effects of the high-energy winter conditions are evident in \n\nthe landward displacements registered from Nov/1999 to Jun/2000. Similarly, the changes \n\nobserved from Jun/2000 to Apr/2002 represent the recovery of the beach width from a post-\n\nwinter to post-summer condition. A mirror image has been observed in between displacement \n\nlines of different time intervals for distinct coastal sectors, indicating that the return to a previous \n\nshoreline configuration and, perhaps, to its original position, is just a matter of time. Although \n\nthese findings refer only to short-time scales, in the longer term, shoreline shapes may be \n\ncontinually recurrent while moving landward or seaward. Shoreline change rates obtained from \n\naerial photographs show that the northern beaches are mainly prograding in the medium-term, \n\nwith rates decreasing southwards, in the same way it was observed for the Holocene evolution. \n\nShifts in the short-term trends are spatially coincident with changes observed in the long-term \n\nand in the dynamics of the transgressive dune fields. \n\n \n\nAdditional Index Words: beach erosion, DGPS, Rio Grande do Sul. \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe knowledge of beach and shoreline changes in Rio Grande do Sul is generally limited \n\nin time and space. Coastal data have been obtained in few places that are distant from each other, \n\nand are, at best, discontinuously available in the last 10 or 15 years. The coastline of Rio Grande \n\ndo Sul is 630-km long and comprises one of the longest continuous sandy shores in the world. \n\nThe visual similarity of its beaches and the lack of data to continuously represent long segments \n\nlead researches often to describe this coast as straight and very homogeneous. However, recent \n\nstudies have shown that this coast is not straight and shows local and regional morphodynamic \n\ndifferences at various time scales (DILLENBURG et al., 2000; ESTEVES et al., 2002, 2003a).  \n\nFrom 1997 to 2002, the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline was mapped five times using the \n\nkinematic Global Positioning System (GPS) method in an effort to follow the trends in recent \n\n\n\n \n\n 48 \n\nshoreline change studies, which have focused in gathering continuous data at a regional scale. \n\nAlthough only 20% of the state shoreline are developed, the coastal population has grown faster \n\nin the last decade and some pristine areas are already under threat of unplanned occupation \n\n(ESTEVES et al., 2003b). A better understanding of the shoreline dynamics at various time \n\nscales is urgently required to support regional and local coastal management plans. This study \n\ndescribes magnitudes and patterns of short-term shoreline changes, focusing in the regional \n\nalongshore differences. Additionally, the short-term patterns are compared with medium-term \n\nrates obtained from aerial photos (from 1974, 1989, and 2000) and from evidence of the \n\nHolocene evolution of coastal barriers in an attempt to better understand shoreline changes in Rio \n\nGrande do Sul. \n\n \n\nSTUDY AREA \n\nRio Grande do Sul is the southernmost state in Brazil, sited around latitudes 27\u00b0S to \n\n34\u00b0S and longitudes 50\u00b0W to 57\u00b0W (Figure 4.1), presenting a humid temperate climate with \n\nwarm to hot temperatures in summer (mean of 26\u00baC) and cool temperatures in winter (mean of \n\n12\u00baC). About 450,000 people live in coastal cities, or less than 4.5% of the state\u2019 s population \n\n(ESTEVES et al., 2003b). The majority of the developed areas is concentrated along the \n\nnorthernmost 120 km, comprised mainly by second houses that are occupied only in the summer \n\nmonths, when about 2 million people move to the coast (ESTEVES et al., 2003b). The study area \n\nconsists in the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline, where only two permanent discontinuities occur \n\n(Tramanda\u00ed and Patos lagoon inlets). The coast is usually divided into three major sectors: (1) the \n\nsouthern sector extends 220 km from the Chu\u00ed creek (at the Uruguayan border) to the Patos \n\nlagoon inlet (2) the central sector is a 290 km-long and mostly undeveloped shore, and (3) the \n\nnorthern sector, a 120-km long urbanized shoreline, extending from Quint\u00e3o beach to the border \n\nwith Santa Catarina state (Figure 4.1). \n\nThe RS coast is characterized by a complex system of coastal lakes and lagoons formed \n\nduring the Quaternary sea-level fluctuations. In the last 5 ka, no new sand has been supplied to \n\nthe shore from inland as the lagoon system retains the sands transported by the rivers \n\n(TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). According to DILLENBURG et al. (2000), sand budget in the RS \n\ncoast has been controlled by alongshore gradients of wave energy resulted from the \n\nconcentration of wave rays in large-scale coastal projections and dissipation along smooth \n\nembayments. Northeast winds blow constantly along the shore, although southerly winds are the \n\nstrongest and more frequent from April to July (fall and winter). Alongshore currents are bi-\n\ndirectional, but there is a net sediment transport to the north due to the strong southerly waves \n\n\n\n \n\n 49 \n\nassociated with the passage of cold fronts. This is a microtidal coast with tidal variation less than \n\n0.5 m; consequently, waves are the main hydrodynamic process.  \n\nIntermediate beaches composed by well-sorted fine quartzose sands dominate in the RS \n\n(e.g. TOLDO Jr. et al., 1993; CALLIARI and KLEIN, 1993; BARLETTA et al., 1999), except \n\nalong (a) the reflective to intermediate beaches of the Concheiros do Albard\u00e3o, a 30-km long \n\nsegment between Albard\u00e3o lighthouse and Hermenegildo (southern sector), where bioclastic \n\ngravels are added to the quartzose fine sands forming a bimodal sediment, and (b) the dissipative \n\nbeaches from Cassino Beach to Sarita Lighthouse (southern sector), where there is a slightly \n\ndecrease in the mean grain size in the area of Cassino Beach caused by the suspended sediments \n\ncarried through the Patos Lagoon mouth (CALLIARI and KLEIN, 1993). \n\n \n\nMETHODS \n\nFrom 1997 to 2002, the Rio Grande do Sul shoreline was mapped five times using the \n\nkinematic Global Positioning System (GPS) method (i.e. TOLDO Jr. et al., 1999; MORTON et \n\nal., 1993). The state beaches are flat, dissipative, continuous, and undeveloped, characteristics \n\nthat favor the application of the kinematic GPS method to map the 630-km long shoreline in a \n\nfast and economic way. This study aims to compare shoreline positions mapped in 1997 \n\n(Nov/26-28th), 1998 (Nov/17-19th), 1999 (Nov/10-11 and 19th), 2000 (June/26-28th), and 2002 \n\n(April/15-17th) to determine regional differences in alongshore patterns of shoreline changes. \n\nAdditionally, shoreline change rates were estimated from sets of vertical aerial photographs, and \n\nFigure 4.1. The Rio Grande do Sul shoreline is 630-km long and is usually subdivided in three major coastal \n\nsectors: (1) southern, (2) central, and (3) northern. \n\n\n\n \n\n 50 \n\nthe long-term evolution of coastal barriers (during the Holocene) are analyzed to better \n\nunderstand coastal changes in the RS.   \n\nThe aerial photographs used in this study were obtained in Jan/1974 and Feb/1989 (scale \n\nof 1:20.000) by the state Departamento Aut\u00f4nomo de Estradas e Rodagens (DAER), and in 2000 \n\nlow altitude, small format, digital photographs were obtain by the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Universidade \n\nFederal do Rio Grande (FURG) using the ADAR-1000 system (FONTOURA and HARTMANN, \n\n2001). Distances between control points (at least 6 in each photograph) were measured to \n\nestablish the error due to distortions and also due to the accuracy in identifying the exact points \n\nfrom where the measures were taken. Then, beach widths were measured every 150 m or 200 m \n\nin front of stable points along at least 2 km in five different beaches and the average rate of \n\nchange was estimated for each one of the beaches.  \n\nIn 1997, shoreline mapping was conducted using two Garmin GPS 100 Personal \n\nSurveyor; one was installed in a vehicle moving along the water line in an average velocity of 50 \n\nkm/h to register positions every 5s, and the other was set in static mode every 100 km to enhance \n\nthe horizontal accuracy to 3 m. In the following years, position data were corrected using a fixed \n\nGPS antenna. In 2000 and 2002, a Trimble GPS 4600 was used to register positions every 3s, \n\nresulting in an accuracy of 1 m. A major source of error in this study consists in the spatial and \n\ntemporal waterline oscillations along the smooth slope of the RS beaches (1/30 in average). Such \n\nerrors were minimized as mapping was always conducted on similar conditions (e.g. tidal levels, \n\nfair weather, no storms or passage of cold fronts in the weeks before field work). The waterline \n\nwas chosen as the reference feature as it could be followed throughout the length of the study \n\narea and could be easily identified while driving along the beach. Dune crest or scarp, vegetation \n\nline, and berm crest are not continuous along the entire coast; then cannot be used to compare \n\nbeach segments that are distant to each other. The high water line was the reference feature \n\nmapped in 2002, therefore a correction was necessary to allow this shoreline to be analyzed with \n\nthe others. The correction consisted in displacing the shoreline mapped in 2002 seaward based on \n\nthe distance from the high water line to the waterline measured on aerial photos obtained in 2000 \n\nand 1989. Such distances were measured every 200 m along several beaches, and the mean \n\nvalues were applied for segments with similar characteristics. \n\nThe ArcView GIS 3.2 program was used to display and organize the shoreline position \n\ndata from where the ArcView extension Digital Shoreline Analysis System 2.0, developed by the \n\nU.S. Geological Survey (THIELER et al., 2003), was applied to measure distances between \n\nmapped lines and to estimate shoreline change rates every 1 km alongshore for the regional \n\nanalysis and every 250 m for the detailed analysis of the northern sector. Identification of \n\nregional patterns of shoreline displacement was based on line graphs of alongshore distance vs. \n\nshoreline change where a landward movement (shore retreat) was represented as negative values, \n\n\n\n \n\n 51 \n\nand seaward movements (beach accretion) as positive values. Alongshore distance was measured \n\nfrom south to north, starting at the jetty of the Chu\u00ed creek (at the border with Uruguay) and \n\nending at the beach of Itapeva in Torres. Although shoreline change rates are presented, they \n\nshould not be interpreted as long-term trends as the time frame from the available data is too \n\nshort. Rates were estimated to allow comparison between short and longer-term trends. \n\n \n\nALONGSHORE PATTERNS OF SHORELINE MOVEMENTS \n\nGraphs of shoreline changes (Figure 4.2) indicate that shoreline movements occur \n\ndifferently along the three major coastal sectors of Rio Grande do Sul, including the maximum \n\namplitude of displacements and the effects of seasonal and interannual changes (ESTEVES et \n\nal., 2003a). Alongshore patterns of annual and seasonal changes are described below. \n\n \n\nAnnual Changes \n\nFigure 4.2a represents annual changes in shoreline position as it shows displacements \n\nbetween Nov/1997-Nov/1998 and Nov/1998-Nov/1999. In general terms, magnitudes of changes \n\nand trends presented by both lines are similar along the southern sector, and to opposite \n\ndirections in the central and northern sectors. Magnitudes of changes and shoreline mobility are \n\ngreater along the central sector, where shoreline positions oscillate up to 140 m. Less variability \n\nis observed along the southern and northern sectors, where shoreline positions vary up to 50 m. \n\nFrom Nov/1997 to Nov/1998, shoreline movements were exclusively seaward along the \n\nsouthern sector, indicating beach accretion with mean shoreline displacement of 25 m. From \n\nNov/1998 to Nov/1999, similar behavior was observed, except in the southernmost 60 km where \n\nerosion was registered. Along the southern sector, the shoreline tends to move further seaward \n\nfrom south to north, oscillating around 20 m along the southern 90 km and reaching 50 m \n\nnorthwards (Figure 4.2a). This is partly due to the shoreline orientation, as the northern part of \n\nthis sector is characterized by an embayment (i.e. favors deposition), and partly due to the long-\n\nterm progradation of this coastal barrier (i.e. DILLENBURG et al., 2000; ESTEVES et al., \n\n2003a). In the central sector, both annual lines (Nov/1997-Nov/1998 and Nov/1998-Nov/1999) \n\nshow a wavy pattern alongshore (Figure 4.2a). They move seaward and landward to opposite \n\ndirections and show regularly spaced peaks that do not always have same amplitudes. \n\nMagnitudes of changes are greater for the Nov/1997-Nov/1998 period, mainly for the seaward \n\nmovements, resulting in a mean displacement around 22 m, while the mean for the Nov/1998-\n\nNov/1999 line is 2.8 m. The cause of such wavy pattern is unknown, but preliminary analysis  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 52 \n \n\nFigure 4.2. Line graphs comparing shoreline displacements to show alongshore differences in the patterns of \n\nannual changes (a) and in the seasonal effect (b, c, and d). Positive values represent seaward shoreline \n\ndisplacement and negative values represent landward movements. \n\n\n\n \n\n 53 \n\nindicates that it might be associated with smooth bulges and embayments on the shoreline \n\nconfiguration. \n\nAnnual lines also move to opposite directions along the northern sector. However, they \n\ndo not oscillate from shoreward to landward displacements, as the Nov/1997-Nov/1998 line \n\nshows only beach accretion, and the Nov/1998-Nov/1999 line presents mainly erosion (Figure \n\n4.2a). Shifts in the direction of the longshore current might be the main factor driving those lines \n\nto move to opposite direction in the period. The direction of the littoral drift has been visually \n\nregistered three times a day at the fishing pier of Tramanda\u00ed since 1996 (NICOLODI et al., \n\n2000). The data show that the longshore current was dominantly flowing to SW in 1996 and \n\n1997, shifting to NE in 1998 and 1999, returning to flow to SW in 2000, 2001, and 2002. \n\nConsidering that the NE winds dominate along the Rio Grande do Sul coast, it is expected that \n\nthe longshore currents flow in the NE-SW direction most of the time. However, the net longshore \n\nsand transport has been from SW to NE as the southerly waves are higher and more energetic. \n\nTaking into account that the net longshore transport is to the NE even when the main direction of \n\nthe littoral drift is to SW, it is likely that sediment transport to the NE is more intense when the \n\nlittoral drift flows dominantly to the same direction (i.e. 1998 and 1999). According to the data \n\ncollected since 1996, in normal years, the longshore current flows to SW more than 60% of the \n\ntime. It is assumed that, for such conditions, there is a balance in the volume of sediment \n\ntransported alongshore as currents from the south are less frequent but stronger. When currents \n\nfrom south are dominant, a greater volume of sediment is probably mobilized from the areas with \n\na shoreline orientation more exposed to the SSE waves where potential longshore transport is \n\ngreater (LIMA et al., 2001). These sediments are then transported north and deposited in the \n\nareas of less potential sediment transport, such as smooth embayments or along a segment of less \n\nexposed shoreline angle. Thus, the accretion registered in the northern sector from Nov/1997-\n\nNov/1998 might be due to deposition of sediments eroded from beaches further south where \n\nalongshore sediment transport is more intense. The erosion registered in the following year is \n\nlikely to represent the return of the shoreline to a more stable position as the ratio of SW and NE \n\ncurrents were already returning to normal. The reversal in the net direction of longshore currents \n\nis coincident with the strong El Ni\u00f1o event of 1997/1998. However, at this moment, no further \n\ninvestigation was conducted to evaluate the possible effects of El Ni\u00f1o in the coastal currents of \n\nRio Grande do Sul. \n\n \n\nSeasonal Changes \n\nSeasonal effects on the patterns of shoreline movements were observed through the \n\nanalysis of the changes registered between the shorelines mapped in November (1997, 1998, and \n\n\n\n \n\n 54 \n\n1999) and the ones mapped in June/2000 and April/2002. The effects of the higher energy \n\nconditions dominant in the fall and winter seasons can be observed in figure 4.2b. As expected, \n\nshoreline displacements in the period Nov/1999-Jun/2000 are mainly shoreward, indicating that \n\nan eroded condition prevails at the end of fall/beginning of winter along the three sectors. There \n\nis no evident rhythmic pattern alongshore in the Nov/1999-Jun/2000 line but a mirror image with \n\nthe Nov/1998-Nov/1999 line is clear along the northern 130 km of the southern sector (Figure \n\n4.2b). The spatial coincidence of peaks with similar magnitudes in opposite directions suggests \n\nthat the shoreline returns to a pre-existing position along this segment. It implies also that the \n\naccretion registered in a one-year interval (from Nov/1998 to Nov/1999) was balanced by retreat \n\nin the following 7 months (or the next fall/winter season). Figure 4.2a shows that similar \n\naccretion was observed in the previous year (from Nov/1997 to Nov/1998). This raises the \n\nquestion whether such accretions are always balanced by retreat in the following winter or \n\nwhether there is a net accretion in the short term that corroborates with the long-term \n\nprogradation of the barrier.  \n\nApart from the northern part of the southern sector, a mirror image was not observed in \n\nother areas for the period Nov/1998 to Jun/2000 (Figure 4.2b). However, such effect occurs \n\nalong the northern sector when a longer period is considered (Figure 4.2c). The mirror image \n\nobserved between the lines Nov/1997-Nov/1998 and Nov/1998-Jun/2000 indicates that the \n\naccretion over a period of one year was balanced by erosion 19 months later along the northern \n\nsector. A mean line derived from those lines shows a total recovery of the previous shoreline \n\nposition from the Tramanda\u00ed inlet to Xangril\u00e1, with a slightly negative balance southwards and a \n\npositive balance northward. In these areas, the beach width was not completely recovered \n\nbecause opposite peaks of displacements were not of the same magnitude. The mirror effect was \n\nalso registered by LIST and FARRIS (1999) before and after a storm along the shores of Outer \n\nBanks (North Carolina, US) and Cape Cod (Massachusetts, US). The mirror image indicates that \n\nthe shoreline has a memory of its original shape, to which it returns from time to time (LIST and \n\nFARRIS, 1999). Considering that the mirror image has been observed for different beaches on \n\nvaried short-time scales (after passage of a storm, seasonally, and annually), the return to a \n\nprevious shoreline configuration and, perhaps, to its original position, is just a matter of time. \n\nMaybe, an important question is whether such shape and position are dominant in time or \n\nrepresent only transitory moments in between a highly dynamic state.    \n\nIn contrast to the Nov/1999-Jun/2000-line, the June/2000-April/2002 line shows \n\naccretion throughout the study area (Figure 4.2d). Such accretion was expected as this line \n\ncompares a retreated beach registered at the end of the fall (June/2000) and a beach accreted by \n\nthe fair-weather conditions that prevail in the summer (January to March). As in the Nov/1999-\n\nJun/2000-line, the June/2000-April/2002 line does not show the regular wavy pattern observed \n\n\n\n \n\n 55 \n\nalongshore in the annual lines (see Figure 4.2a) and also do not form a mirror image with any of \n\nthe displacement lines obtained in this study. Although out of phase, the shape of the line and the \n\nmagnitudes of changes are similar and opposed to the Nov/1999-Jun/2000 line (Figure 4.2d). \n\nPossibly, peaks of maximum shoreline variation travel alongshore according to seasonal changes \n\nin energetic conditions up to the moment where previous shoreline configuration and/or positions \n\nare re-established. \n\n \n\nSHORELINE CHANGES IN THE LONGER TERM \n\nTo better understand changes along the state shoreline, a more detailed analysis was \n\nconducted for the northern sector, combining data of short-term changes (DGPS lines), rates \n\nestimated from aerial photos taken in 1974, 1989, and 2000, and evolution of coastal barriers in \n\nthe Holocene. According to DILLENBURG et al. (2000), the coastal barrier had prograded from \n\nTorres to Tramanda\u00ed and remained stable from Tramanda\u00ed to Mostardas (central sector) during \n\nthe Holocene (see Figure 4.3). Although the time interval of the DGPS monitoring is too short to \n\nprovide consistent rates of changes, they were estimated just to compare the general alongshore \n\ntrends with the ones observed in the Holocene. The shoreline change rates obtained for the period \n\nNov/1997 to Apr/2002 show accretion from Torres to Xangril\u00e1, stability to mild accretion from \n\nXangril\u00e1 to Tramanda\u00ed, and erosion southwards up to Mostardas (Figure 4.3). Table 4.1 shows \n\nmean rates of changes estimated by linear regression that corroborate with these general trends. \n\nCidreira is located south of Tramanda\u00ed and has been subjected to erosion (-4.5 m a-1), Xangril\u00e1 \n\nhas slightly accreted (0.7 m a-1), and the other beaches located north of Xangril\u00e1 have accreted \n\nconsiderably (>1.0 m a-1) from 1997 to 2002.   \n\nIt is worth to note that Xangril\u00e1 is the place where there is a remarkable change in the \n\nwidth of the modern transgressive dune fields, which are narrow to the north and wider \n\nsouthwards, covering the entire Holocene barrier (DILLENBURG et al., 2000; 2003). From \n\nTramanda\u00ed to Mostardas, the transgressive dune fields are much wider and extend also on top of \n\nthe Pleistocene barrier (DILLENBURG et al., 2003), indicating a recent process of beach retreat \n\n(HESP, personal communication). Thus, trends of shoreline change obtained from the short-term \n\ndata are more or less in accord with the observed behavior of present transgressive dune fields \n\n(Figure 4.3). \n\nComparison of aerial photographs for five urbanized beaches along the northern sector \n\nsuggests that rates of change in the medium-term are highly variable alongshore, but agree well \n\nwith the short-term trends (Figure 4.3). Measurements of shoreline positions were taken along 3 \n\nkm in the area of Arroio do Sal, 5 km in the area of Curumim and Arroio Teixeira, 2 km in the \n\narea of Xangril\u00e1, and 2 km in the area of Cidreira. Note that Cidreira is about 50 km south of \n\n\n\n \n\n 56 \n\nXangril\u00e1 that is 20 km south of Arroio Teixeira (less than 1 km apart from Curumim), which is \n\nabout 15 km south of Arroio do Sal. Rates of changes will be presented as a range when the \n\nuncertainties of measurements affect the mean value estimated for each area. Shoreline change \n\nrates estimated from aerial photos and from the DGPS monitoring are presented in table 4.1. \n\nIt seems that the alongshore variability of shoreline changes is due to long-term gradients \n\nof wave energy caused by the shape of the shoreline and the steepness of the inner shelf \n\n(DILLENBURG et al., 2003). Thus, higher energy (concentration of wave rays) tends to occur \n\nalong convex shorelines adjacent to steeper inner shelf, and lower energy (dissipation of wave \n\nrays) is likely to occur along concave shores adjacent to a less steep shelf, favoring erosion and \n\ndeposition, respectively. LIST and FARRIS (1999) have registered similar alongshore \n\nheterogeneity of shoreline changes along the Outer Banks (North Carolina, USA). It was \n\nobserved that a complex pattern of accretion and erosion zones can be created as a result of high-\n\nangle waves approaching to the shoreline, i.e. when the angle that deep-water waves approach to \n\nthe shoreline is greater than the one that maximizes longshore transport (ASHTON et al., 2003). \n\nAlthough this process is still to be verified along the state\u2019 s shoreline, it is clear that the \n\nlongshore sediment transport as a function of shoreline orientation is a major factor influencing \n\nalongshore variability of shoreline changes. \n\n \n\nFigure 4.3. Shoreline changes in the short-term (1997-2002), medium-term (1974-2000), and long-term \n\n(Holocene) along the northern coastal sector of the Rio Grande do Sul. Aspects of the transgressive dune \n\nfields and the Holocene evolution were based on DILLENBURG et al. (2000, 2003). \n\n\n\n \n\n 57 \n\nIt is clear from these data that the northern beaches are mainly prograding in the \n\nmedium-term (Figure 4.3), with a trend of decreasing rates southwards, in the same way it has \n\nbeen described for the long-term coastal evolution. The area of Curumim/Arroio Teixeira has \n\npresented one of the largest progradation in the Rio Grande do Sul coast during the Holocene \n\nwith rates around 2 - 3 m a-1, similarly to the values obtained from the aerial photos for the \n\nperiod 1974 to 2000 (3.0 - 3.4 m a-1 in Curumim, and 1.4 - 2.6 m a-1 in Arroio Teixeira). In \n\nXangril\u00e1 and Cidreira, measurements indicate lower rates of accretion than in the areas further \n\nnorth (Table 4.1). The variability of the rates obtained for different periods in the area of Arroio \n\ndo Sal illustrates the oscillation from accreted to eroded phases that seems to be characteristic of \n\nthe intermediate beaches of the Rio Grande do Sul. The shoreline fluctuates back and forth in the \n\nshort-term while the coast progrades or retreats in the long-term. Such variability is probably due \n\nto a combination of factors, including interannual or decadal changes in wave climate, \n\nconsequently in the volume and direction of alongshore transport, and effects of cyclic events \n\nsuch as El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a.  \n\nA recent trend of shoreline retreat in a long-term prograding coast was also registered \n\nalong the Brittany beaches, in the Atlantic coast of France (BATTIAU-QUENEY et al., 2003) \n\nand along part of the NW coast of England (PYE, 1990). The recent erosion along that part of the \n\nFrench coast is attributed to the depletion of sand reserves accumulated on the shoreface since \n\nthe post-glacial marine transgression (PASKOFF, 1998 in BATTIAU-QUENEY et al., 2003). \n\nThis might be a factor to be considered also for the Rio Grande do Sul coast, where sand \n\ndeposited on the adjacent shelf have been reworked to form coastal barriers in the last 5 ka (see \n\nDILLENBURG et al., 2000) and no new sand have been supplied to the shore since then \n\n(TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). \n\n \n\nTable 4.1.

Differences include the amplitude of changes, the time frame in which beach \n\nwidths are recovered, and the alongshore patterns of change due to seasonal and annual effects. \n\nFrom these findings, it is possible to conclude that, in a regional scale, the Rio Grande do Sul \n\ncoast is neither straight nor homogeneous. The high alongshore variability of shoreline change \n\nrates is probably due to differences in the alongshore sediment transport resulted from changes in \n\nthe shoreline orientation. The analysis of short-term changes (5 years), medium-term average \n\nrates (26 years), and the trends of coastal evolution in the Holocene indicates that beaches along \n\nthe northern coastal sector of Rio Grande do Sul are prograding north of Xangril\u00e1, and stable to \n\nslightly prograding to the south, although a recent trend of erosion has been registered south of \n\nTramanda\u00ed. It is interesting to note that the short-term changes reflect differences in the behavior \n\nof modern transgressive dune fields, and that the estimated medium-term rates of change agreed \n\nwell with the long-term trend observed during the Holocene.  \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThe authors would like to thank the Divis\u00e3o de Aerofotogrametria of the DAER for \n\nproviding the aerial photos, the Instituto de Pesquisas Hidr\u00e1ulicas (IPH/UFRGS) for the DGPS \n\nmonitoring, and Dr. Patrick A.

Shoreline position data were obtained by kinematic \n\nDGPS applied to map the 618-km long coastline five times between November 1997 and April \n\n2002. The data show that the shoreline responds differently to seasonal and interannual variations \n\nalong the three major coastal sectors, especially in the magnitude of changes, in the time-interval \n\nin which the shoreline returns to a previous position, and in the dominant length-scales over \n\nwhich the shoreline changes occur. Spatial and temporal changes in shoreline position are \n\nexamined with respect to the influences of grain size, shoreline orientation, longshore sediment \n\ntransport, storms, and ENSO events. Present results indicate that the alongshore variability in the \n\npatterns of change is strongly influenced by changes in shoreline orientation and the associated \n\neffects on gradients of longshore transport. Variations in wave energy and storminess determine \n\nthe seasonal patterns of shoreline changes while ENSO events are likely to influence the \n\nregistered interannual changes. It was observed that the short-time scales for the shoreline to \n\nreturn to a previous shape and position varied for different beach segments. This raises the \n\nquestion whether such shoreline shapes and positions are dominant through time or merely \n\nrepresent transitory moments between dynamic states. These results demonstrate the importance \n\nof regional studies to improve understanding of the factors driving both temporal and spatial \n\nvariability of shoreline changes. \n\n \n\nAdditional Index Words: beach erosion, DGPS, storms, El Ni\u00f1o, longshore sediment transport \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nFrequently, sandy coastlines exhibit alongshore variability at a wide range of spatial and \n\ntemporal scales. Coastal changes are a result of processes acting on the scale of few millimeters \n\nand seconds (at sand grain levels) up to scales of hundreds of kilometers and centuries (regional \n\nsand budget) in a way that variations observed at any scale affect the others (KOMAR, 1999). \n\nCoastal processes interact with each other producing complex patterns of shoreline changes \n\nwhere alternating areas of net erosion and accretion found adjacent to one another at one time \n\nmay exhibit opposite trends at another time. Understanding beach response to variations in wave \n\nenergy conditions, tides, storminess, etc. at different time-scales is a minimum requirement for \n\ncoastal engineering projects and management practices (DOUGLAS et al., 1998; HONEYCUTT \n\net al., 2001; PAJAK and LEATHERMAN, 2002). This is especially important at a regional scale, \n\n\n\n 64 \n\nwhere coastal management decisions are taken and better scientific knowledge is required \n\n(STOCKDON et al., 2002). The main problem associated with sustainable development of the \n\ncoastline is attributable to short-term extreme events. Thus, for many practical applications, it is \n\nessential to develop accurate techniques to determine the maximum amplitude of the waterline \n\nfluctuations and the frequency of their occurrence. \n\nVery few studies in Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and in Brazil have addressed contemporary \n\ncoastal processes or beach changes at a regional scale. Most have been limited to discontinuous \n\nmonitoring of beach profiles in few places (ESTEVES et al. 2003a). Aerial photos are also \n\nscarce, usually limited to recent years, covering short coastal segments, and often of inadequate \n\nscale. Only recently the use of kinematic Global Positioning System (GPS) method allowed \n\ncollection of shoreline position data continuously along the RS (TOLDO et al., 1999; ESTEVES \n\net al., 2003a). Additionally, the lack of wave measurements along the RS makes difficult to \n\ndetermine the local wave climate or estimate any parameters based on wave conditions. In the \n\npresent study, a data set of shoreline positions obtained by kinematic GPS along the 618 km of \n\nthe RS coastline is analyzed. Shoreline mapping was conducted five times from 1997 to 2002 \n\nand the seasonal, interannual, and spatial variability in the observed shoreline changes are \n\nquantified in this paper at a regional scale. Additionally, the influence of the following factors is \n\nexamined: sediment grain size, shoreline orientation, wave climate, storms, the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern \n\nOscillation (ENSO), and the net longshore sediment transport rates. Results presented here \n\nimprove understanding of relationships between the principal forcing conditions that affect the \n\nmorphology of a coastline which have a broad application at other sites worldwide.  \n\n \n\nSTUDY AREA \n\nThe study examines the 618-km long shoreline of RS, Brazil, which extends from the \n\nBrazil-Uruguay border in the south to the Santa Catarina state border in the north. This coastline \n\nhas an approximately NE-SW orientation and an undulated shape due to the presence of two \n\nlarge-scale projections and two embayments (Figure 5.1). Three major coastal sectors can be \n\nidentified: (a) the southern sector, extending 220 km from the Chu\u00ed creek at the Uruguayan \n\nborder to the Patos Lagoon inlet, is one of the longest continuous sandy beaches in the world; (b) \n\nthe undeveloped central sector, extending about 275 km north from the Patos Lagoon inlet, is \n\nbisected only by the intermittent opening of the Peixe Lagoon entrance; and (c) the highly \n\nurbanized northern sector, extending a further 123 km to Torres, is bisected by the Tramanda\u00ed \n\nLagoon inlet (Figure 5.1). \n\nThe RS shore is part of a large coastal plain formed and shaped by the Quaternary sea-\n\nlevel fluctuations that resulted in a complex system of coastal lakes and lagoons. Most of the \n\n\n\n 65 \n\nfluvial sediment inputs are retained in the lagoon system, restricting the sand supply from inland \n\nto the shore (TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). As such conditions have existed since the regression \n\nfollowing the maximum of the Holocene transgression (the last 5 ka), alongshore gradients of \n\nwave energy might have controlled the coastal sediment budget due to concentration of wave \n\nrays in large-scale coastal projections and dissipation in the embayments (DILLENBURG et al., \n\n2000). Tidal variation is less than 0.5 m along the RS coast (TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). Waves \n\nare the main hydrodynamic agent with mean significant height (Hs) of 1.4 m and peak period (Tp) \n\nof 7 s to 9 s that can exceed 3 m and 12 s, respectively during the passage of extratropical \n\ncyclones (ALMEIDA and TOLDO, 1997). \n\nWind and wave conditions along the RS coast are determined by two high-pressure \n\nsystems: (1) the Atlantic anticyclone that is semi-fixed with center around 30\u00b0S over the southern \n\nAtlantic Ocean, and (2) the mobile Polar anticyclones (KRUSCHE et al., 2002; SARAIVA et al., \n\n2003). The first generates tropical maritime air masses of high temperature and humidity, \n\nFigure 5.1. The study area showing: the 620-km long shoreline of Rio Grande do Sul, and three major \n\ncoastal sectors: (a) southern, (b) central, and (c) northern. Note the approximately NE-SW orientation and \n\nundulated shape of this shoreline due to the presence of two large-scale projections and two embayments. \n\nGray lines are bathymetric contours of 20 m, 50 m, and 100 m. \n\n\n\n 66 \n\nresponsible for the NE winds that dominate along the RS shore most of the year (SARAIVA et \n\nal., 2003). The polar anticyclones migrate to lower latitudes as stable, cold, and dry air masses \n\ngenerating winds from S, SW, and SE. The Atlantic anticyclone weakens and moves to lower \n\nlatitudes in the winter, allowing the polar anticyclones to reach further north, resulting in stronger \n\nand more frequent southerly winds from April to July. \n\nWhilst observed longshore currents are bi-directional (NICOLODI et al., 2000), coastal \n\ngeomorphic features indicate a net northward sediment transport (TOMAZELLI and \n\nVILLWOCK, 1992) driven by larger waves from the south. Such waves are associated with the \n\npassage of frontal systems that reach the RS coast on average four times per month (SARAIVA \n\net al., 2003), increasing to 6-7 per month in the winter (OLIVEIRA, 1986). The passage of cold \n\nfronts also generate strong SW winds (e.g. BRAGA and KRUSCHE, 2000) which often result in \n\nstorm surges O(1 m). These are more frequent in the fall and occur along the RS beaches in two \n\nsituations: (1) a low-pressure system over the ocean is intensified by the presence of a high-\n\npressure system over the continent creating a long fetch for a cyclone migrating from SW thereby \n\npiling water onto the shore due to the Ekman transport, and (2) a cyclone is formed over the \n\ncontinent (in RS, Uruguay, or Argentina) and moves towards the shore generating strong local \n\nwinds and high waves (SARAIVA et al., 2003). \n\nIntermediate beaches composed by well-sorted fine quartzose sands dominate in the RS \n\n(e.g. TOLDO et al., 1993; CALLIARI and KLEIN, 1993; BARLETTA, 2000), except along (a) a \n\n30-km long segment between Albard\u00e3o lighthouse and Hermenegildo (in the southern sector) \n\nwhere reflective to intermediate beaches are composed by bimodal sediment due to the addition \n\nof bioclastic gravels, and (b) the dissipative beaches from Cassino Beach to Sarita Lighthouse \n\n(southern sector), where the suspended sediments carried through the Patos Lagoon mouth \n\ndecrease the mean grain size along Cassino Beach (CALLIARI and KLEIN, 1993). The average \n\nbeach slope is 1/30 along the northern coastal sector (TOLDO and ALMEIDA, 2003), varying \n\nfrom 1/26 to 1/40 along the central sector (BARLETTA, 2000), and from 1/13 to 1/30 along the \n\nsouthern sector (CALLIARI and KLEIN, 1993). \n\n \n\nMETHODS \n\nThis study compares shoreline positions mapped in 1997 (November 26th-28th), 1998 \n\n(November 17th-19th), 1999 (November 10th-11th and 19th), 2000 (June 26th-28th), and 2002 (April \n\n15th-17th) to determine alongshore patterns of shoreline changes at a regional scale. Hereafter, for \n\nconvenience, these surveys are referred to as Nov1997, Nov1998, Nov1999, Jun2000 and \n\nApr2002, respectively. Using the swash line as the reference feature, the shoreline was mapped \n\nby the kinematic GPS method (e.g. MORTON et al., 1993; TOLDO et al., 1999). Three days and \n\n\n\n 67 \n\nU$1,000 were required to complete the 618-km long survey, making the kinematic GPS a fast \n\nand economic method to monitor the state\u2019 s shoreline. In 1997, two Garmin GPS 100 Personal \n\nSurveyor were used; one installed in a vehicle moving along the swash line at an average \n\nvelocity of 50 km/h registering positions every 5s, and the other was set in static mode every 100 \n\nkm. The horizontal precision of the shoreline position was 3 m after data correction. In the \n\nfollowing years, data corrections were based on a fixed GPS antenna, and in 2000 and 2002, a \n\nTrimble GPS 4600 was used to map the shoreline, improving the horizontal accuracy in shoreline \n\npositions to 1 m.  \n\nAlthough previous surveys were referenced to the swash line, the high water line (HWL) \n\nwas the feature mapped in 2002. Therefore a correction factor was applied to allow comparison \n\nwith the other lines. The correction was based on the mean values of the distances between the \n\nHWL and the swash line measured every 200 m to 500 m on aerial photos taken in 1989 and \n\n2000. The mean values were determined for segments presenting similar characteristics and used \n\nas a correction factor to displace the shoreline mapped in 2002 seawards. The swash line and the \n\nHWL are easily identified while driving along the beach (e.g. PAJAK and LEATHERMAN, \n\n2002) and were used to map the shoreline because they are the only reference features that can be \n\nfollowed continuously throughout the length of the study area. TOLDO and ALMEIDA (2003) \n\nconsider that the errors in mapping the RS shoreline using the swash line as reference feature are \n\nattributable to the gentle slope of the beaches, tidal variation, storm surges, and wave run up. To \n\nreduce some of these errors, shorelines were mapped when tide and meteorological conditions \n\nwere similar. The difference in tidal levels during the surveys was &lt;0.2 m, and no storms or \n\npassage of cold fronts were registered in the weeks before fieldwork. Measurements of waves \n\nalong the RS coast for the period of the GPS surveys are not available. However, considering a \n\nwave run up of 0.55 m estimated for RS beaches (TOLDO and ALMEIDA, 2003), a tidal \n\nvariation of 0.2 m, and no storm surges, the potential errors on the horizontal position of the \n\nmapped shorelines are estimated for different beach segments according to their slope. Along the \n\nnorthern coastal sector, beach slope is usually 1/30, resulting in a horizontal error of 22.5 m or \n\naround \u00b111 m (6 m due to tidal variation and 16.5 m due to run up). Along the central sector, \n\nbeach slope varies from 1/26 to 1/40, resulting in a horizontal error ranging from 19.5 m (about \n\n\u00b110 m) to 30 m (\u00b115 m), respectively. The beach slope along the southern sector varies from \n\n1/13 to 1/30, so the estimated potential horizontal errors range from 9.75 m (about \u00b15 m) to 22.5 \n\nm (around \u00b111 m), respectively. Vertical bars representing the cumulative error for different \n\nsectors of the coast are displayed in the shoreline change graphs only for selected points to avoid \n\ninterfere in the clarity of the figure. The errors estimated for the horizontal position of the \n\nwaterline are very similar to the mean values of the distances measured between the HWL and \n\n\n\n 68 \n\nthe swash line, indicating that they provide a consistent correction factor between those reference \n\nfeatures.  \n\nMapped shorelines were displayed and organized in ArcView GIS 3.2. The ArcView \n\nextension Digital Shoreline Analysis System 2.0 (DSAS 2.0), developed by the U.S. Geological \n\nSurvey (THIELER et al., 2003), was used to measure changes in shoreline position and rates of \n\nchange every 250 m alongshore. Graphs of alongshore distance vs. shoreline changes or rates of \n\nchange use the following convention: landward movements (shore retreat) are given negative \n\nvalues, seaward movements (beach accretion) are given positive values, and alongshore distance \n\nwas measured from south to north, starting at the jetty of the Chu\u00ed creek. Although the GPS data \n\nprovides detailed snapshots of the shoreline positions useful for examining alongshore \n\ndifferences and interannual and seasonal changes, it cannot be used to deduce long-term trends. \n\nSuch trends in shoreline movements can only be observed after decades of continued monitoring \n\nand are therefore not considered further here.  \n\nCentral to studies of all sandy coastlines is a requirement for accurate predictions of the \n\nlongshore sediment transport (LST) rate. Most formulae state that the LST is proportional to the \n\nlongshore wave energy. Here LST is calculated using the CERC formula (USACE, 1984) in the \n\nform  \n\n)sin(H\ng\n\n)p)(s(\nK\n\nQ b\n.\nb,s ??\n\n2\n1116\n\n52\n??\n\n=         \n\nwhere Q is the volumetric sediment transport rate expressed in units of m3s-1, K is the so-called \n\nCERC constant, s is the specific density of the sediment, p is the sediment porosity, ? is a wave \n\nbreaker index, often taken to be 0.78 (WEGGEL, 1972), Hs,b is the wave breaker height and ?b is \n\nthe wave breaker angle relative to the shoreline. In the present study, methods used to obtain Hs,b \n\nand ?b values using deep water wave scenarios described below assume straight regular contours \n\nand follow linear wave theory. Further details are given by WILLIAMS et al. (in preparation). \n\nHere we use p = 0.32, a well accepted value for fine and medium sand. It is noted that several \n\nparameters that logically might influence LST are apparently excluded explicitly from the CERC \n\nformula, including the breaker type, the beach slope, and the sediment grain size. These are \n\ngenerally considered to be encompassed by the K parameter. BAILARD (1981) reports that in \n\nconditions where 2.5 cm/s &lt;ws &lt;20.5 cm/s, 0.2\no &lt;? &lt;15o and 0.3 m/s &lt;uw,b &lt;2.83 m/s: \n\n)wu(.)(sin..wu,K sb,wsb,w 0070262050\n2 ++=?= ??  \n\nwhere uw,b is the RMS wave orbital velocity at the breaker point and ws is the sediment settling \n\nvelocity defined by SOULSBY (1997) as   \n\n\n\n 69 \n\n( ) ?\n?\n\n?\n?\n?\n\n? ?+= 36.10049.136.10\n5.03\n\n*\n2\n\n50\nD\n\nD\nws\n\n?\n  \n\nwhere ? is the kinematic viscosity of water. Here we choose to use K values from the Bailard \n\nequation as they account for hydrodynamic and sediment properties and the equation is valid for \n\nconditions pertaining along the RS shoreline.  \n\n \n\nALONGSHORE VARIABILITY IN THE SEASONAL AND INTERANNUAL \n\nPATTERNS OF SHORELINE MOVEMENTS \n\nThe present GPS data allows study of shoreline changes continuously along RS at \n\nvarious spatial scales. At a regional scale, i.e. along the three major coastal sectors, seasonal and \n\ninterannual variations in the shoreline position exhibit different responses either in the magnitude \n\nof displacements and/or in the time-scale in which the shoreline returns to a previous position \n\n(ESTEVES et al., 2003a). Analysis of data pertaining to shoreline positions along RS allows \n\nidentification of the general differences in the patterns of shoreline movements presented and \n\ndiscussed below.  \n\nAnnual changes in the shoreline position are represented here by the displacements \n\nregistered between lines mapped in Nov1997, Nov1998, and Nov1999 (Figure 5.2a). Patterns of \n\nannual shoreline movements are significantly different along the three major coastal sectors: \n\nseaward movements (i.e. accretion) are observed along most of the southern sector, a rhythmic \n\npattern of alternating shoreward and landward movements occurs along the central sector, and a \n\nless pronounced rhythmic pattern occurs along the northern sector showing accretion from \n\nNov1997 to Nov1998 and erosion from Nov1998 to Nov1999 (Figure 5.2a). Larger magnitudes \n\nof changes (almost 150 m) occur along the central sector, and lower magnitudes along the \n\nnorthern and southern sectors, where they are mainly within the 50 m range.  \n\nMorphodynamic studies indicate that beach profiles tend to show accretion in the \n\nsummer (December to March) as a result of the dominant fair weather conditions, and erosion in \n\nthe winter (June to August) due to the more energetic conditions (e.g. BARLETTA, 2000; \n\nWESCHENFELDER et al., 1997; CALLIARI and KLEIN, 1993). This seasonal behavior is \n\nobserved in figure 5.2b, showing landward movements of the shoreline dominating from \n\nNov1999 to Jun2000 and seaward movements dominating from Jun2000 to Apr2002. The \n\nNov1999-Jun2000 line represents the erosion that prevails in the fall-winter months as it \n\ncompares an accreted shoreline mapped at the end of spring (November) with an eroded \n\nshoreline mapped in the winter (June). Conversely, the Jun2000-Apr2002 line shows accretion \n\n\n\n 70 \n\ndue to the calm conditions of the spring-summer months as it compares a shoreline mapped in \n\nwinter with a shoreline mapped in April, before the first storms of fall.  \n\nThe alongshore variability is observed also in the length-scales over which the shoreline \n\nchanges occur in RS. Here wavelet analysis (TORRENCE and COMPO, 1998) using a Morlet \n\nwavelet was used to assist in the identification and quantification of the dominant length-scales \n\nof change in the RS shoreline position. Wavelet analysis has the advantage of representing the \n\nfrequency spectrum in a two-dimensional plot, and shows the spatial variability in the dominant \n\nlength-scales along the shore. Results of the wavelet analyses for the entire RS shoreline are \n\nshown in Figure 5.3. Figure 5.3a shows annual changes between November 1997 and November \n\n1998 and Figure 5.3b shows seasonal changes between June 2000 and April 2002. This figure \n\nalso includes plots of the shoreline position data used in the analyses. Gaps in the data series are \n\nFigure 5.2. Shoreline change graphs for the RS coast, showing annual (a) and seasonal (b) changes in the \n\nshoreline position (original data is shown in gray and moving average lines in black). Annual changes are \n\nrepresented by the displacements in the shoreline positions registered from Nov1997 to Nov1998 and from \n\nNov1998 to Nov1999. Seasonal changes are represented by shoreline movements registered between \n\nNov1999 (spring) and Jun2000 (winter), and between Jun2000 and Apr2002 (beginning of fall). Note that \n\nseaward movements of the shoreline (accretion) are identified by positive values and landward movements \n\n(erosion) by negative values. \n\n\n\n 71 \n\nindicated by the gray shading.

Whilst wavelet analysis of the seasonal shoreline displacements \n\nFigure 5.3. Results from wavelet analysis of shoreline change data used to identify the dominant length-\n\nscales over which the majority of shoreline changes occur. The wavelet spectra (a) for the period Nov1997 \n\nto Nov1998 represents annual changes and show that variations in the shoreline changes in the southern, \n\ncentral and northern sectors occurs dominantly at length scales O(10 km), O(100 km), O(30 km), \n\nrespectively. The wavelet spectra (b) for the period Jun2000 to April2002 represents seasonal variations \n\nand does not show a strong concentration of energy at any particular length-scale and evidences that \n\nvariations in shoreline position occur at length scales O(10 km) along the whole shoreline. The solid white \n\nline on the figure indicates the maximum resolvable length scale. Plots of the shoreline changes used in the \n\nanalyses are presented on top of the respective wavelet spectra. \n\n\n\n 72 \n\ndoes not show a strong concentration of energy at any particular length-scale (Figure 5.3b), it is \n\nevident that seasonal variations in shoreline position occur at much shorter length scales O(10 \n\nkm) along the whole shoreline. These results indicate that the alongshore variability in the annual \n\nchanges along the central and northern sectors are due mainly to low-frequency changes in \n\nshoreline position, which appear to be related to the rhythmic pattern observed in those sectors \n\n(Figure 5.2a). Such pattern was not observed in the annual or in the seasonal changes along the \n\nsouthern sector, where high-frequency variations are more important in determining the \n\nalongshore variability of both annual and seasonal shoreline changes. The wavelet analysis \n\nreveals therefore that despite the apparent uniformity of the coastline, quite different coastline \n\nresponses are observed to both the evolution time and the geographical location. It is noted also \n\nthat in the case of the annual changes (Figure 5.3a), the dominant length scales of change are \n\ndifferent along each of the two major coastal projections and along each of the two major \n\nembayments. Other data series analyzed using wavelets exhibited similar properties (not \n\nillustrated).   \n\n \n\nSouthern Sector \n\nFrom Nov1997 to Nov1998, beach accretion dominates along the southern sector except \n\nin a 15-km long segment 85 km north of Chu\u00ed, where peaks of erosion occur in the area of the \n\nAlbard\u00e3o Lighthouse (Figure 5.4a). The mean shoreline change is 25.9 m with standard deviation \n\nof 13.9 m, and peaks of accretion and erosion reaching 91.6 m and \u201318.1 m, respectively (Table \n\n5.1). South of Albard\u00e3o, magnitudes of seaward movements are mainly within the 0 m to 40 m \n\nrange, and increase to 20 m to 60 m northwards. Seaward movements also dominate from \n\nNov1998 to Nov1999, except along the southernmost 50 km (Figure 5.4a). The presence of \n\nerosion areas in this line results in a lower mean shoreline change (19.1 m) and a larger standard \n\ndeviation (21.3 m) than in the previous year (Table 5.1).  \n\nA seasonal effect is evident along the northern part of the southern sector when shoreline \n\ndisplacements represented in the Nov1998-Nov1999 and Nov1999-Jun2000 lines are compared \n\n(Figure 5.4b). In that segment, the accretion observed in one year (Nov1998 to Nov1999) is \n\nmatched by retreat in the following winter, with an interval of seven months. Peaks of maximum \n\naccretion and erosion have similar magnitudes and are spatially coincident producing an almost \n\nperfect mirror image (mean line around zero). The mirror effect indicates the return of the \n\nshoreline to a pre-existing position, suggesting that the shoreline has a \u201c memory\u201d  of its original \n\nshape (LIST and FARRIS, 1999). The opposite behavior of the Nov1998-Nov1999 and \n\nNov1999-Jun2000 lines is evidenced by the mean shoreline change values of similar magnitude \n\nand opposite signs (Table 5.1) and by the high negative correlation factor (-0.75). A mirror image  \n\n\n\n 73 \n\nTable 5.1.

Shoreline changes along the southern coastal sector. Annual changes (a) are represented by \n\nshoreline movements registered from Nov1997 to Nov1998 and from Nov1998 to Nov1999. Seasonal \n\nchanges (b) are determined by comparison of shoreline movements registered between the Nov1998 to \n\nNov 1999 and Nov1999 (spring) to Jun2000 (winter) intervals. Vertical bars represent the estimated error \n\nin the horizontal shoreline position. Seaward movements of the shoreline are identified by positive values \n\nand landward movements by negative values.  \n\n\n\n 74 \n\nis not observed along the southernmost segment at the same time-scale. However, shoreline \n\nchanges of similar magnitude and opposite direction (although not showing the same exact shape \n\nor coincident peaks) occur along the southernmost 30 km when comparing the Nov1997-\n\nNov1998 and Nov1998-Jun2000 lines. \n\nAs observed before, the southern sector can be divided into two segments defined by \n\ndifferences in the short-term shoreline changes. These segments also show a different trend in the \n\nlong-term (the last 5 ka), as the area north of Albard\u00e3o has been prograding and the southern area \n\nhas been retreating (DILLENBURG et al., 2000). In the southernmost 90 km, accretion in one \n\nyear is followed by erosion in the next, and alternate areas of erosion and accretion occur \n\nalongshore at scales of 4 km to 6 km. Similar alongshore variability at a scale of 5 km to 10 km \n\nwas reported for the coastlines of the Outer Banks (North Carolina, USA) and Cape Cod \n\n(Massachusetts, USA) by LIST et al. (2003). The northernmost 130 km is characterized by larger \n\nmagnitudes of changes with accretion in November (annual lines) being approximately balanced \n\nby erosion in the following winter (Figure 5.4b). As accretion was registered in both annual lines \n\n(Figure 5.4a), this raises the question whether such accretion is always balanced by erosion in the \n\nfollowing winter, resulting in a state of quasi-equilibrium in the short-term. Considering that the \n\nlong-term trend is still valid, it is likely that a net accretion exists in the medium (decades) to \n\nlong-term (centuries to millennia) even if there is a short-term (seasonal) balance between \n\nerosion-accretion. The mean shoreline change for the northern 130 km is 29.5 m from Nov1998 \n\nto Nov1999 and -27.4 m from Nov1999 to Jun2000, indicating a positive net balance in the \n\nshort-term that might be contributing to the long-term progradation. Although there is evidence \n\nthat this area is accreting in the short and medium terms, rates of accretion have decreased in \n\ntime as shown by comparison of aerial photographs from 1947, 1974, and 2000 (L\u00c9LIS and \n\nCALLIARI, 2003). \n\n \n\nCentral Sector \n\nAnnual changes along the central sector are characterized by oscillatory movements, \n\nwith alternating adjacent areas of erosion and accretion (Figure 5.5) occurring at scales O(30 to \n\n100) km. This is evident in the results from the wavelet (Figure 5.3a). It is interesting to note that \n\nin consecutive years, the shoreline movements are in opposite directions, i.e. areas that have \n\neroded from Nov1997 to Nov1998 have accreted in the following year and vice-versa. Peaks of \n\nmaximum changes are spatially coincident but show different magnitudes, resulting in a mean \n\nline that fluctuates around zero at Mostardas (from 370 km to 400 km north of Chu\u00ed) and exhibits \n\na net seaward movement to the south and a net landward displacement to the north. Magnitudes \n\nof changes and alongshore variability are greater along the central sector for both years, although \n\n\n\n 75 \n\nvariations are larger in the Nov1997 to Nov1998 period, as reflected by the standard deviation \n\nand maximum and minimum values shown in Table 5.1.  \n\nThe oscillating pattern observed in the annual shoreline change lines (Figure 5.5) is not \n\npresent in the Nov1999-Jun2000 and Jun2000-Apr2002 lines (Figure 5.2b). This observation \n\nindicates that a rhythmic shoreline configuration is a temporary or seasonal feature. Magnitudes \n\nof displacements increase from south to north and are dominantly landward from Nov1999 to \n\nJun2000 with a mean value of -24.1 m (Table 5.1). In contrast, seaward movements dominate \n\nfrom Jun2000 to Apr2002 with a mean value of 37.9 m. As discussed above, these lines reflect \n\nseasonal changes, i.e. the erosion due to the high-energy conditions in fall-winter and the beach \n\nrecovery in the summer. Magnitudes and the alongshore variability of shoreline changes are \n\nconsiderably lower in these lines than in the annual lines, as can be observed in the lower values \n\nof maximum, minimum, and standard deviation of shoreline displacements (Table 5.1). High-\n\nfrequency changes are not very import in any of the displacement lines, as most of the energy of \n\nthe spectra is concentrated in variations of longer scales, as demonstrated by the wavelet analysis \n\n(Figure 5.3).  \n\n \n\nNorthern Sector \n\nAlong the northern sector, annual displacement lines show an undulating shape and are \n\nopposed to each other (Figure 5.6a). The dominant shoreline movement was seaward from \n\nNov1997 to Nov1998 with a mean value of 21.6 m (Table 5.1). Although erosion dominated \n\nfrom Nov1998 to Nov1999 (mean of \u20132.54 m), the displacement line oscillates around zero \n\nalternating areas of accretion and erosion in some beach segments (Figure 5.6a). In common with \n\nFigure 5.5. Annual changes in the shoreline position along the central sector from Nov1997 to Nov1998 \n\nand from Nov1998 to Nov1999. The estimated cumulative error in the horizontal shoreline position is \n\nrepresented by vertical bars. Note that seaward movements of the shoreline are identified by positive values \n\nand landward movements by negative values. \n\n\n\n 76 \n\nthe other sectors, magnitudes of change are larger for the Nov1997-Nov1998 line. Figure 5.6a \n\nshows also that areas where magnitudes of shoreline changes are greater (generally 40 m to 60 \n\nm) are about three times longer than the adjacent areas where changes are minor (from 0 m to \n\n20m).  \n\nThe seasonal lines Nov1999-Jun2000 and Jun2000-Apr2002 show mainly erosion and \n\naccretion, respectively, with magnitudes of changes decreasing from south to north (Figure 5.2b). \n\nSimilarly to the southern sector, an approximate mirror image is observed along the northern \n\nsector but at a longer time-scale (Figure 5.6b). The accretion registered from Nov1997 to \n\nNov1998 is balanced by erosion in the Nov1998 to Jun2000 interval, i.e. 19 months later. A \n\nmean line derived from the Nov1997-Nov1998 and Nov1998-Jun2000 lines shows a recovery of \n\nthe previous shoreline position from the Tramanda\u00ed inlet to Xangril\u00e1, with a slightly negative \n\nbalance southwards of this area and a positive balance northwards. A shoreline change analysis \n\nbased on aerial photos from 1974, 1989, and 2000 also indicates that beaches have been stable \n\nfrom Tramanda\u00ed to Xangril\u00e1 (ESTEVES et al., 2004). In the long-term, the barrier has prograded \n\nfrom Torres to Tramanda\u00ed and has been stable to the south (DILLENBURG et al., 2000). So it \n\nseems that the area from Tramanda\u00ed to Xangril\u00e1 marks a transition between areas that are \n\nFigure 5.6. Shoreline changes along the northern sector, showing the undulating shape of the annual \n\ndisplacements lines (a), where shoreline movements were dominantly seaward from Nov1997 to Nov1998 \n\nand dominantly landward from Nov1998 to Nov1999. Observe that the accretion registered from Nov1997 \n\nto Nov1998 is balanced by erosion from Nov1998 to Jun2000, forming an approximate mirror image (b). \n\nVertical bars represent the cumulative error in the horizontal shoreline position. \n\n\n\n 77 \n\naccreting in the short and long-terms (to the north) and areas that have been stable in the long-\n\nterm and eroding in the medium to short-term (to the south). North of Xangril\u00e1, transgressive \n\ndunes are limited to a narrow fringe (100 m to 500 m) projecting from the modern foredunes, \n\nwhile the Holocene barrier is completely covered by transgressive dunes to the south \n\n(DILLENBURG et al., 2000) indicating shoreline retreat. Determining if this represents a change \n\nin the long-term trend for the beaches south of Tramanda\u00ed or if it simply indicates a transient \n\nmoment in a highly variable short-term fluctuation requires further monitoring of shoreline \n\nposition. \n\n \n\nTHE INFLUENCE OF PATTERNS OF SHORELINE MOVEMENTS ON THE RATES \n\nOF CHANGE \n\nEarlier studies have emphasized that mapped shorelines might not represent a mean \n\nseasonal position, especially when they are influenced by large short-term changes (e.g. DOLAN \n\net al., 1980; SMITH and ZARILLO, 1990). However, given that the mean shoreline position is \n\nnot necessarily dominant in time, it is considered here that is more important to consider which is \n\nthe modal (i.e. more frequent) shoreline position and shape at different time-scales (SMITH and \n\nZARILLO, 1990). Additionally, as a great part of the hazard to coastal development is \n\nattributable to short-term extreme events, for management purposes it is essential to estimate the \n\nmaximum changes of the waterline and how frequently they occur. \n\nA long-time record of shoreline positions is required to estimate rates of changes. Thus, \n\nthe available data do not provide information sufficient to derive a reliable estimation of the \n\nlong-term rates for the RS coast. However, graphs showing short-term rates of change are \n\npresented to illustrate the effects of the patterns of shoreline displacements on the magnitude and \n\ntrends of shoreline change rates. Here, rates of shoreline change were estimated by the linear \n\nregression and end-point methods using different time intervals (1997 to 2002 and 1998 to 2002). \n\n Rates estimated by the linear regression and end-point methods show similar trends \n\nalong most of the RS coastline, although differences in the magnitudes of rates are observed in \n\nareas of high mobility such as the central sector (Figure 5.7a). Rates of changes estimated by the \n\nend-point method for the periods 1997 to 2002 and 1998 to 2002 are similar along the southern \n\nsector and show different magnitudes and trends along the central and northern sectors (Figure \n\n5.7b). The similarity and lower magnitudes of the annual displacements observed along the \n\nsouthern sector result in rates of similar magnitudes and trends independently of the shoreline \n\nposition data used. On the other hand, the oscillatory and reversed behavior of the shoreline \n\nmovements along the northern and central sectors produces rates of changes with magnitudes and \n\ntrends that are considerably different depending on which shorelines are compared (ESTEVES et \n\n\n\n 78 \n\nal., 2003b). Rates estimated by the linear regression method for 1997 to 2002 and 1998 to 2002 \n\nalso show differences in the magnitudes of rates, but trends differ only along parts of the central \n\nsector, where annual changes to opposite directions are more pronounced.  \n\nSeveral studies have shown that shoreline change rates estimated by linear regression are \n\nmore reliable than the ones obtained by the end-point method, mainly because the second uses \n\nonly two data points and is extremely dependent on the conditions they represent (e.g. \n\nCROWELL et al., 1997; HONEYCUTT et al., 2001; FENSTER et al., 2001). The results \n\nobtained for the RS coastline show that the linear regression method can be used to assess the \n\ntrends of short-term rates, except for the areas where magnitudes of annual displacements are \n\nlarge (> 60 m) and occur to opposite directions. At the same time, it is clear that rates based on \n\nonly two data points can differ enormously, even showing opposite trends (i.e. erosion or \n\naccretion), depending on the data used. Thus, it is important to know the variability and \n\nmagnitude of shoreline changes (in the short-term) to understand the real meaning of rates based \n\non few data points (i.e. the end-point method).   \n\nFigure 5.7. Rates of (short-term) shoreline changes estimated for the RS coast based on DGPS shoreline \n\nmapping, showing results obtained by (a) the end-point and linear regression methods for the 1997 to 2002 \n\ntime interval, and (b) the comparison of rates obtained by the end-point method for the periods 1997 to \n\n2002 and 1998 to 2002. Positive values represent accretion and negative values represent erosion. \n\n\n\n 79 \n\nFACTORS INFLUENCING THE ALONGSHORE VARIABILITY OF THE \n\nSHORELINE CHANGES \n\nData presented in the previous sections show that the shoreline responds differently \n\nalongshore to seasonal and annual changes. Considering that beaches are complex environments \n\nthat respond to the interaction of land, sea, and atmospheric processes acting at different \n\ntemporal and spatial scales, it is difficult to assess which is the dominant factor responsible for a \n\nspecific observed change. Whilst sometimes it may be possible to identify a major influencing \n\nfactor over short time periods, it is considered that a combination of factors interacting in a non-\n\nlinear manner drives beach processes and determines changes in morphology (KOMAR, 1999). \n\nThis section examines the influences of grain size, shoreline orientation, longshore sediment \n\ntransport, storms, and ENSO on the seasonal and annual patterns of shoreline change observed in \n\nthe data. \n\n \n\nGrain Size \n\nGenerally, RS beaches are composed by well-sorted fine quartzose sands (MARTINS, \n\n1967) with mean grain size around 2.25 \u00d8 to 2.75 \u00d8 (0.15 mm to 0.21 mm). Major differences \n\noccur in: (1) Estreito, south of the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Lighthouse in the central sector, where mean grain \n\nsize vary seasonally from 1.9 \u00d8 to 2.38 \u00d8 (0.19 mm to 0.27 mm) due to the presence of shell \n\nfragments (BARLETTA, 2000); (2) the beaches around the Patos Lagoon mouth, where fine \n\nsediments reduce the mean size to 2.5 \u00d8 to 2.9 \u00d8 (0.135 mm to 0.18 mm) (SIEGLE, 1996); and \n\n(3) between Albard\u00e3o lighthouse and Hermenegildo (southern sector), where bimodal sediments \n\ncomposed by quartzose fine sands (2.25 \u00d8 or 0.21 mm) and bioclastic gravels (-0.5 \u00d8 or 1.5 mm) \n\noccur along a 30-km long segment (CALLIARI and KLEIN, 1993). However, these changes are \n\nrelated to geological settings (i.e. fine sediments supplied by the Patos lagoon and shell \n\nfragments transported cross-shore from relict underwater deposits to the beach) and do not reflect \n\nalongshore differences on the present dynamic processes. Excluding the areas of major changes \n\nin the mean grain size, there is a subtle decrease in the mean grain size from south to north along \n\nthe RS beaches (Figure 5.8), which might be reflecting sorting associated with the net longshore \n\ntransport of sediment to the north (e.g. BIRD, 1996). Additionally, gradients of wave energy \n\nalong the shoreline as yet undetermined may also contribute to alongshore sediment sorting (e.g. \n\nCARTER, 1988). \n\nComparing grain size data presented by SIEGLE (1996) with patterns of shoreline \n\nchange in the southern sector, it is possible to associate areas of coarser mean grain size (south of \n\nAlbard\u00e3o) with lower magnitudes of changes and less alongshore variability, and areas of finer \n\nmean grain size with areas of greater changes. In the central sector, both annual lines show a \n\n\n\n 80 \n\nrhythmic pattern alongshore (Figure 5.5) that are similar to oscillations observed in the mean \n\ngrain size of beach samples collected by the Center of Coastal and Ocean Geological Studies \n\n(CECO/UFRGS) every 20 km along the central and northern sectors (Figure 5.8). Although \n\nvariations are subtle (about 2.2 \u00d8 to 2.8 \u00d8 or 0.13 mm to 0.2 mm), it is noted that the mean grain \n\nsizes decrease towards the center of the embayments where shoreline changes are greater. The \n\nlength-scale of the fluctuations observed in the shoreline movements along the central sector is \n\nsimilar to the length-scale of the variation in mean grain sizes (Figure 5.8). It seems that \n\nmagnitudes of shoreline changes are strongly related to grain size that in turn is related to the \n\nshape of the shoreline, i.e. larger changes occur in the embayments where finer grain sizes occur. \n\nHowever, the use of grain size data as a proxy for variability in the shoreline changes should be \n\ncarefully considered as other factors also interact with them (e.g. geological settings, wave \n\nenergy conditions). \n\nHigher concentrations of heavy minerals have been associated with areas of erosion (e.g. \n\nROY, 1999; FRIHY and KOMAR, 1993). Along the RS coastline, SIEGLE (1996) found that \n\nareas of high erosion rates present greater percentage of heavy minerals than adjacent non-\n\neroding beaches, such as in Hermenegildo and Bujuru (north of the Patos lagoon mouth). \n\nAccording to DILLENBURG et al. (2004), these are the only two significant concentrations of \n\nheavy minerals occurring in the RS coast, and both occur where long-term receded barriers \n\ndominate. Additionally, preliminary results indicate also a strong correlation between the \n\nconcentrations of heavy minerals, the long-term evolution of coastal barriers, and rates of LST \n\nalong the central and northern sectors (CARLA BARROS, CECO/UFRGS, personal \n\ncommunication). In this study, it is observed that concentrations of heavy minerals are higher \n\nimmediately north of locations where there is a significant increase in the LST (estimated by \n\nmodeling), which also coincides with areas of long-term coastal retreat.  \n\nFigure 5.8. Comparison of annual shoreline changes and variations in mean grain size along the central and \n\nnorthern coastal sectors. Observe that the length-scale of the fluctuations observed in the shoreline change \n\nlines is similar to the length-scale of the variation in mean grain sizes. \n\n\n\n 81 \n\nShoreline orientation \n\nThe RS coastline has a general NE-SW orientation with subtle changes (&lt;5\u00b0) alongshore \n\nwhen short beach segments are considered. However, due to its undulating shape, changes in \n\nshoreline orientation in the order of 10\u00b0 are observed at a regional scale. Such changes in \n\nshoreline orientation influence the angle that waves approach the beach face and thus play a \n\nmajor role in determining the direction and magnitude of LST. In order to show the effect of \n\nwaves approaching from NE, E, ESE, SE, S, SSW, and SW in different coastal orientations, \n\nFigure 5.9 shows annual LST predicted for the RS coastline by the CERC formula (USACE, \n\n1984) for wave heights of 0.5 m 1.0 m and 1.5 m. The figure shows that the shoreline orientation \n\naffects LST in three ways: (1) the direction of net sediment transport, (2) the magnitude of net \n\ntransport, and (3) the alongshore variations in the magnitude and direction of net sediment \n\ntransport. Some waves result in a net transport to the same direction along the entire coastline \n\nwith only minor differences in the magnitude of rates. This applies to waves from E (90\u00b0) and S \n\n(180\u00b0) that cause intense sediment transport to the south and north, respectively (Figure 5.9). \n\nAlthough waves from NE (45\u00b0) and SSW (200\u00b0) push transport always to the south and to the \n\nnorth, respectively, they are more effective in some areas than in others, resulting in major \n\nchanges in the magnitude of transport. It is evident, for example, that embayment areas located \n\nsouth of coastal projections are protected from NE waves (Hs ? 1.5 m), e.g. Cassino beach. \n\nInteresting to note that SW waves (Hs ? 1.5 m) generate a near nil net transport along most of the \n\nRS shoreline, resulting in significant net transport only in the beaches north of the Patos Lagoon \n\nmouth up to Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse, an area that is subjected to long-term erosion. Other waves \n\nresult in a more complex LST response (e.g. ESE and SE waves), with net transport to the south \n\nin some segments, to the north others, and little if any transport in others (Figure 5.9). Figure 5.9 \n\nindicates that a combination of waves of differing heights and directions for variable lengths of \n\ntime could conceivably result in a balance of sediment transport or a nil net rate along some \n\nbeach segments. \n\n Changes in shoreline orientation also influence the distribution of energy reaching the \n\nshore due to wave refraction, which tend to erode coastal projections due to concentration of \n\nwave energy and to promote deposition along the embayments due to decrease in wave energy \n\n(e.g. PETHICK, 1984; KOMAR, 1998). According to DILLENBURG et al. (2000), higher wave \n\nenergy along the projections and less energy along the embayments due to dissipation across a \n\nwider shelf are mechanisms influencing strongly the sediment budget along the RS coast in the \n\nlast 5 ka. The 220-km long southern coastal sector has an undulated shape due to the presence of \n\na large-scale coastal projection from Chu\u00ed to Sarita Lighthouse and a large-scale embayment \n\nnorthward of the Sarita Lighthouse. The shoreline responds differently to seasonal changes along \n\nthe southernmost 90 km (approximately south of Albard\u00e3o lighthouse) and along the northward \n\n\n\n 82 \n\nsegment, from Albard\u00e3o lighthouse to Cassino beach (Figure 5.4). The area where there is a \n\nchange in the response of the shoreline corresponds to the apex of a large-scale coastal projection \n\nwhere magnitudes of changes and the variation between the displacement lines tend to be \n\nminimum. On the other hand, the largest peaks of change coincide with the central part of the \n\nembayment between Cassino and Sarita lighthouse (ESTEVES et al., 2003a). Therefore, it is \n\nlikely that sediments eroded from the projections are transported alongshore to the embayments \n\nthus making a larger volume of sand available to the cross-shore transport. Common with \n\nobservations along the central sector, the largest shoreline changes in the southern sector were \n\nobserved in an embayment where finer mean grain sizes occur (as discussed in the previous \n\nsection).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5.9. Results of annual longshore sediment transport predicted for the RS coast by the CERC \n\nformula (USACE, 1984) for the stated wave directions and significant wave heights of 0.5 m, 1.0 m, and \n\n1.5 m. The alongshore variation in the sediment transport indicates the influence of shoreline orientation in \n\nthe direction and magnitude of net sediment transport. \n\n\n\n 83 \n\nStorms, cyclogenesis, and El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) \n\nStorms along the RS coast are more frequent in the fall and winter and are associated \n\nmainly with the passage of cold fronts and extratropical cyclones. The stormy season starts in \n\nApril, when extreme events occur due to the combination of spring tides, high energy waves, and \n\nstorm surges (CALLIARI et al., 1998). Such combination of high water levels and high wave \n\nenergy favors erosion in parts of the beach that are not subjected to the waves attack under \n\nnormal conditions (DOLAN and DAVIS, 1992). Thus, the first fall storms result in intense \n\nerosion and large profile changes in RS beaches as they impact onto the accreted beaches formed \n\nduring the fair-weather conditions in the summer (CALLIARI et al., 1998). Analysis of wind \n\ndata (daily means) registered in Rio Grande from 1988 to 2003 shows that NE winds dominate in \n\nsummer (31%) and winter (39%), but the second and third dominant winds are SE (14%) and E \n\n(10%) in the summer and SW (24%) and SE (10%) in the winter. Thus, SW winds account for \n\nmost of the difference in seasonal energy conditions, as they are related to the passage of \n\nextratropical cyclones and are involved in 65% of the storm surge events in Rio Grande \n\n(SARAIVA et al., 2003). Although MOTTA (1969) reported that wind and wave directions \n\nshowed no correlation in the Tramanda\u00ed dataset, it is likely that the increase in the frequency of \n\nSW winds in the fall and winter is associated with storminess, which in turn result in higher wave \n\nenergy and beach erosion along RS beaches. \n\nCyclones affecting southern Brazil are generated either in the southern Atlantic Ocean or \n\nin the southern Pacific Ocean crossing the Andes towards the Atlantic Ocean (GAN, 1992). In \n\nthe winter, the sea surface temperature (SST) gradient between the Falkland and Brazil currents \n\nenhance the heat flux into the cold air masses moving from the continent to the ocean, \n\nintensifying cyclogenesis around 32.5\u00b0S to 55\u00b0W (GAN, 1992; SINCLAIR, 1995) and increasing \n\nthe number of cyclones affecting the RS coastline. According to GAN (1992), from 1979 to \n\n1988, cyclones occurred in all seasons, but were more frequent in the fall and winter when 6 and \n\n8 cyclones crossed the Andes, respectively, and 30 were formed in the southern Atlantic Ocean, \n\nin average per season.  \n\nThe atmospheric circulation along the RS is strongly affected by the obstruction of \n\nfrontal systems propagation that can last from 5 days up to 3 weeks, more frequently in the fall \n\nand less frequently in the winter and spring, resulting in longer periods of dry or wet weather \n\n(KRUSCHE et al., 2002). Several studies suggest that the obstruction of cold fronts and the \n\nassociated increase in rainfall in southern Brazil is due to the strengthening and southwards shift \n\nof the subtropical jet at higher levels, which occurs in the spring of the initial El Ni\u00f1o year \n\n(KRUSCHE et al., 2002; GRIMM, 2003; CAZES-BOEZIO et al., 2003). Other studies show that \n\nthe enhanced subtropical high-level jet over southern Brazil causes above-normal blocking of \n\n\n\n 84 \n\nfrontal systems over southern Brazil also during El Ni\u00f1o winters (e.g. NOBRE et al., 1986; \n\nAMBRIZZI, 1994).  \n\nAccording to PEZZA and AMBRIZZI (2003), there is a higher anticyclone concentration \n\nin the South Atlantic Ocean due to the enhanced Atlantic subtropical high and a high cyclone \n\nconcentration in southern Argentina during El Ni\u00f1o winters. Similarly, GAN (1992) associated \n\nthe largest number of cyclones in 1983 (based on the period 1979-1988) with the intensification \n\nof the subtropical jet caused by the strong El Ni\u00f1o at that year. The high anticyclone \n\nconcentration over the South Atlantic during El Ni\u00f1o winters is replaced by a high cyclone \n\nconcentration in the winter of La Ni\u00f1a years (PEZZA and AMBRIZZI, 2003). Wind data from \n\nRio Grande (RS) show an intensification of wind speeds from all directions and in all seasons in \n\nthe El Ni\u00f1o year of 1997, especially from the NE, N, and W when compared with 1998 or 1999. \n\nHowever, SW winds are more frequent and stronger during the fall, winter, and spring in 1999 \n\n(La Ni\u00f1a year) than in 1997 and 1998, corroborating with the findings of intense cyclogenesis in \n\nLa Ni\u00f1a years reported by TOZZI (2002). \n\nChanges in the atmospheric circulation driven by the ENSO also affect the wave climate \n\nand the longshore currents. Analysis of the longshore current direction obtained through visual \n\nobservations in Tramanda\u00ed (NICOLODI et al., 2000) shows that the current was dominant to SW \n\nin 1996 and 1997, shifting to NE in 1998 and 1999, returning to flow to SW in 2000, 2001, and \n\n2002 (Figure 5.10). The reversal in the net direction of longshore currents is coincident with the \n\nstrong El Ni\u00f1o event of 1997/1998 and La Ni\u00f1a 1998/1999 and might be the main factor driving \n\nannual shoreline changes to show opposite signs along the central and northern sectors as \n\npresented in figures 5.2, 5.5, and 5.6. The differences in the direction of longshore currents were \n\nobserved mainly in the fall and spring. From April to July (fall), currents were flowing to SW in \n\n1997 and to NE in 1998 and 1999; in September and October (spring) currents were dominantly \n\nto NE in 1997 and to SW in 1998 and 1999, and in November and December currents were \n\ndominantly to SW in all years. This suggests that waves from NE and E were dominant in fall \n\n1997, while southerly waves dominate in 1998 and 1999. Although wave data are not available \n\nfor that period, wind distribution indicates that in fall 1997 NE winds were more frequent (22%) \n\nand stronger (mean of 5.4 m/s) than in fall 1998 and 1999 (14%, 3.4 m/s and 2.6 m/s, \n\nrespectively), and southerly winds were significantly less frequent. For example, SW winds \n\noccur in 11% of the time in fall 1997, against 18% in fall 1998 and 23% in fall 1999. Southerly \n\nwinds were more frequent in September and October 1997 than they were in the fall, while winds \n\nfrom NE and E were the most frequent in the spring of 1998 and 1999.  \n\nTherefore, the wind data correlates with the reversal of the longshore currents direction, \n\nsuggesting that the wave climate responds in a similar fashion to the ENSO effects. Thus, the \n\nstrong winds registered in 1997, especially from NE, reflects the intensification of the Atlantic \n\n\n\n 85 \n\nsubtropical high in El Ni\u00f1o years reported by PEZZA and AMBRIZZI (2003). Such high-energy \n\nconditions might have resulted in an accentuated shoreline retreat as registered by the DGPS line \n\nof Nov1997. On the other hand, the less intense winds, lower waves, and reduced storm surge \n\nfrequency observed in the winter of 1998 (post El Ni\u00f1o) reported by TOZZI (2002), favored the \n\nrecovery of the shoreline in 1998 to a more accreted position, as registered in the GPS line of \n\nNov1998. Thus, the El Ni\u00f1o effect would explain the accretion observed from Nov1997 to \n\nNov1998 in the northern sector (Figure 5.6a). Similar results were reported by SOUZA and \n\nANGULO (2003) for the northern coast of Santa Catarina state (southern Brazil), where the \n\nlargest sand loss and beach retreat from 1996 to 2000 occurred from February to September 1997 \n\nand the largest accretion occurred from February to June 1998. \n\n The intensification of cyclone activities in La Ni\u00f1a winters (PEZZA and AMBRIZZI, \n\n2003), reflected by the increase in the number of mid-Atlantic storms in the winter of 1999 \n\n(TOZZI, 2002) and by the stronger and more frequent SW winds registered especially in spring \n\nmonths, might have caused the erosion registered from Nov1998 to Nov1999 in the northern \n\nsector (Figure 5.6a). LAMOUR and SOARES (2003) have associated a reduction in sand volume \n\nin the beaches of northern Santa Catarina in 1996 and 1997 with La Ni\u00f1a and El Ni\u00f1o events, \n\nrespectively. Studying beaches in the same area, SOUZA and ANGULO (2003) have associated \n\nFigure 5.10. Dominant direction of longshore currents obtained through visual observations in the \n\nfishing pier of Tramanda\u00ed, northern coastal sector. The values on top of each column refer to the \n\npercentage of observations available for each year. Note that the current was dominant to SW in 1996 \n\nand 1997, shifting to NE in 1998 and 1999, returning to flow to SW in 2000, 2001, and 2002. Data in \n\n2000 was available only from January to May, and in 2002 from January to July. \n\n\n\n 86 \n\nerosion with El Ni\u00f1o in 1997, but have reported accretion due to La Ni\u00f1a from 1998 to 2000. \n\nProbably, the accretion observed by these authors is due to the fact that the intensification of \n\ncyclogenesis in La Ni\u00f1a year occurs in winter and spring, although winds are generally less \n\nstrong than in El Ni\u00f1o years. This lower energy conditions might result in an overall beach \n\naccretion, especially when comparing profiles from June1998 (winter) and March2000 (end of \n\nsummer), as conducted in that study. Similarly, BESSA Jr. and ANGULO (2003) have related \n\nbeach accretion along the southern coast of Paran\u00e1 (southern Brazil) from February 1999 to \n\nMarch 2000 with lower wave energy during La Ni\u00f1a years. However, their data show a reduction \n\nin beach volume from February to November 1999 in ten of the thirteen beach locations, what is \n\nin agreement with the erosion observed in RS beaches in the same year.  \n\nThe southernmost segment of the southern sector responds similarly to the ENSO effects \n\ndescribed above, although not as strongly as along the northern sector. The northernmost \n\nsegment of the southern sector does not show the opposite movements in consecutive years \n\n(Figure 5.4) probably due to differences in sediment budget. In this area, the sediment budget is \n\nprobably highly positive as a net deposition has been reported in the short (e.g. CALLIARI and \n\nKLEIN, 1993) and long-terms (DILLENBURG et al., 2000). Thus, it is more likely that greater \n\nvariations in the waves energy and/or direction are required to promote changes in patterns of \n\nsediment transport and shoreline movements along that coastal segment. Additionally, the \n\nshoreline movements to opposite directions observed along the central sector in the Nov1997-\n\nNov1998 and Nov1998-Nov1999 lines (Figure 5.5) might result from the ENSO influence in \n\nsouthern Brazil through the shifts in the direction of longshore currents. \n\n \n\nLongshore sediment transport \n\nThere are no published field measurements of LST rates for the RS coast. However, \n\nsedimentary and geomorphologic evidences indicate that the net LST is to the north \n\n(TOMAZELLI and VILLWOCK, 1992). Visual observations of the longshore current direction \n\nregistered three times a day at the fishing pier of Tramanda\u00ed show that currents are bi-directional \n\n(NICOLODI et al., 2000). From March 1996 to July 2002, currents flowing to SW were \n\nobserved in 55% of the time and currents to NE in 45% of the time. The dominance of currents to \n\nSW increases to 60% in spring and summer, while currents to NE are slightly dominant in fall \n\nand winter (52%). Similar results are reported by TOZZI (1999) for 5 years of visual \n\nobservations at Cassino beach. Recently, LST was estimated using the Energy Flux Method \n\n(USACE, 1984) and results indicated that the highest rates of LST are coincident with areas of \n\nerosion (LIMA et al., 2001). The study showed that the largest LST rates occur in the southern \n\nhalf of coastal projections where the shoreline orientation (N45\u00b0E) is close to the optimum angle \n\n\n\n 87 \n\nfor LST for E and S waves (Figure 5.9). The rates of LST depend on sediment availability, \n\nshoreline orientation, and the height, period, direction, and duration of the waves. Thus, \n\nassuming that the volume of sediments is equally available alongshore, the net northward \n\ntransport results mainly from the difference in energy between NE-E waves and SE-S-SW \n\nwaves, which are usually higher and associated with the passage of cold fronts.  \n\nThe reversal in the direction of longshore currents discussed in the previous section \n\nmight also affect the rates and direction of the net LST along different beach segments. \n\nAccording to the available data, the longshore current generally flows to SW in 62% of the time, \n\nbut in 1998 and 1999 currents were to SW 46% and 48% of the time, respectively. It is assumed \n\nthat, in regular years (currents flow to SW in 62% of the time), there is a balance in the net \n\nlongshore transport (ESTEVES et al., 2004) as waves from the south are less frequent but \n\nstronger. Modeling of LST for various combinations of wave heights and directions indicates that \n\na nearly nil net transport can be obtained for a range of scenarios (Figure 5.11). The scenarios for \n\na regular year are based in the following assumptions: (a) NE (45\u00b0) and E (90\u00b0) waves dominate \n\nin 62% of the time and are equally distributed, as observed in the historical wave records \n\npresented by COLI (2000), (b) southerly waves occur in 38% of the year, tested for a range of \n\ncombinations of waves from SE (135\u00b0), ESE (120\u00b0), S (180\u00b0), and SSW (200\u00b0 and 215\u00b0), (c) \n\nSSW waves represent storm conditions and do not occur in more than 10% of a year, in \n\nagreement with the historical wave record (COLI, 2000) and with data from SARAIVA et al. \n\n(2003), (d) waves from NE and E are smaller than southerly waves and are tested for Hs varying \n\nfrom 0.5 m to 1.0 m, (e) waves from SSW are the highest and tested for Hs = 2 m, (f) S, ESE, and \n\nSE waves are tested for Hs from 0.75 m to 2.0 m.  \n\nIn the scenarios tested for a regular year, the net LST can be dominantly to the north \n\n(Figure 5.11a), dominantly to the south (Figure 5.11b), to the same direction in all coastal \n\nsegments (Figure 5.11c,e,f), or show an approximately nil net transport depending on the \n\ncombination of waves height and directions (Figure 5.11b,d). The lack of waves and longshore \n\ncurrents measurements impede the verification of the modeling results used here to simulate \n\nhypothetical situations based on the (qualitative) data available. Considering a scenario where all \n\nsoutherly waves are represented by SE waves (not illustrated), net LST is mainly to the north \n\nwhen Hs >1.25 m, and almost nil for Hs = 0.75 m, except in two sectors: (1) from Chu\u00ed to \n\nAlbard\u00e3o, where the net transport is almost nil in all cases, and (2) from Cassino to north of \n\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse, where net transport is to the south. Adding SSW waves to this scenario, \n\nthere is a reduction in the area showing net transport to the south, shifting completely to the north \n\nwhen 20 days of SSW waves are included and SE waves are Hs ? 1.25 m (Figure 5.11a). The \n\npoints of divergent net LST migrate alongshore according to the contribution of SSW waves. \n\nOne of these points is located around the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Lighthouse area (Figure 5.11a,c) where \n\n\n\n 88 \n\nintense erosion has been reported in the short and long-term (e.g. BARLETTA and CALLIARI, \n\n2003; TOMAZELLI et al., 1998). The other divergent point is located north of the Patos lagoon \n\nmouth, where erosion also has been reported associated to the obstruction of littoral drift by the \n\njetties (e.g. L\u00c9LIS and CALLIARI, 2003).  \n\nConsidering that southerly waves are represented solely by ESE waves, net sediment \n\nFigure 5.11. Annual rates of net longshore sediment transport predicted for the RS coast by the \n\nCERC formula (USACE, 1984) for various combinations of wave heights and directions that \n\nsimulate conditions in years when the longshore current is dominantly to SW (a,b,c,d,e,f) and \n\nyears when the current is dominantly to NE (g,h). Note that the vertical scale is in graphs (a) and \n\n(b) differs from the others. \n\n\n\n 89 \n\ntransport is mainly to the south (not illustrated), except in two sectors where net transport is to \n\nthe north: (1) north of Albard\u00e3o to north of Sarita, and (2) from Solid\u00e3o to Xangril\u00e1. Adding \n\nSSW waves to this scenario, net transport also tend to be pushed northwards; however, the \n\ndivergent points do not migrate alongshore, and more days of SSW waves are necessary to \n\nproduce net transport to the north along the entire coast, i.e. more than 30 days for Hs= 1.25 or 20 \n\ndays for SE waves of Hs= 0.75 m (Figure 5.11b). A nearly nil net transport was observed after 10 \n\nto 15 days of SSW waves for SE waves of Hs= 0.75 m, or after 30 days of SSW waves for SE \n\nwaves of Hs=1.25 m. A net balance is even more persistent when enhancing NE and E waves to \n\nHs= 0.75 m, although more days of SSW waves are required. In several scenarios, the net LST is \n\nto the south in the area north of Cassino up to Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse (Figure 5.11a, b, d). Thus, \n\nsediment eroded from areas further north (i.e. Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse) might be partly balancing \n\nthe sediment deficit caused by the obstruction of the northward LST by the jetties of the Patos \n\nlagoon; explaining why erosion north of the jetties is not as intense as expected when compared \n\nwith the accretion observed to the south. \n\nIncluding S waves in the scenarios described above, the net transport is pushed to the \n\nnorth and there is a trend of smoothing the alongshore differences in the transport rates (Figure \n\n5.11c,d,e,f). In a situation where southerly waves come from S and SE, the net transport is \n\ndominantly to the north even for NE and E waves of Hs = 1.0 m. Same results are obtained from \n\nthe combination of waves approaching from S and ESE, although net transport rates are smaller \n\nand do not change significantly when the height of ESE waves increases. A net transport to the \n\nsouth occurs in a short segment in the area of Estreito with the divergence point occurring near \n\nthe Concei\u00e7\u00e3o Lighthouse, similarly to the scenario described in Figure 5.11a. Adding the SSW \n\nwaves to the scenarios above, net northward transport is enhanced from Cassino to Mostardas \n\nand south of Albard\u00e3o and is slightly reduced in the other areas (Figure 5.11c,d). Increasing the \n\ninfluence of SSW waves from 20 to 35 days, in an attempt to represent intensification of \n\ncyclogenesis, net transport is to the north in all coastal segments with a decrease in the volume of \n\nnet LST, except from Cassino to Mostardas where a  slightly increase in volume is observed \n\n(Figure 5.11e,f). Thus, modeling results show that in an usual year: (a) net transport rates tend to \n\nbe less than 200,000 m3a-1, (b) a net balance is observed in a combination of scenarios, (c) ESE \n\nwaves push sediment transport to the south from Cassino to Solid\u00e3o, (d) SSW waves push net \n\ntransport to the north from Cassino to Mostardas, and (e) the net LST was always to the north \n\nfrom Albard\u00e3o to Sarita and north of Solid\u00e3o to Xangril\u00e1 (for the tested scenarios), while in the \n\nother areas the direction of net transport shifts due to the influence of SE or ESE waves and to \n\nthe increase in the number of SSW waves days. \n\nReducing the occurrence of NE and E waves from 62% to 46% of the time, as shown in \n\n1998 and 1999 by the records of littoral drift directions in Tramanda\u00ed, modeling results are \n\n\n\n 90 \n\nsimilar to the last scenarios described above with a slightly greater volume of net LST. However, \n\nnet transport is to the south from Cassino to Solid\u00e3o only when wave heights are maintained the \n\nsame as in the previous scenarios and SSW waves occur in 20 days or less. However, it is likely \n\nthat wave heights are larger in those years due to the intensification of storminess and more \n\nfrequent SSW waves. In this case, net transport is always to the north and tends to show rates \n\nreaching up to 400,000 m3a-1 (Figure 5.11g,h). Therefore, when currents to NE are dominant, a \n\ngreater volume of sediment is mobilized especially from the areas with a shoreline orientation \n\nmore exposed to the SSW waves (i.e. south of Albard\u00e3o and in the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse area). \n\nThese sediments are then transported north and deposited in the areas of less potential sediment \n\ntransport, such as smooth embayments or along a segment of less exposed shoreline angle, as \n\nsuggested by LIMA et al. (2001).  \n\nModeling results thus show that net LST can be to the south or to the north in adjacent \n\ncoastal segments under certain wave conditions. However, shifts in the direction of longshore \n\ncurrents could not explain the oscillations of shoreline changes registered along the central sector \n\nwhere erosion alternates with accretion in adjacent segments. Such oscillations are more or less \n\ncoincident with smooth changes in shoreline orientation that also relates with changes in the \n\nmean grain sizes (Figure 5.8). Recent studies have suggested that longshore transport tend to \n\nincrease perturbations in a straight shoreline when the angle between the wave crests and the \n\ngeneral shoreline orientation is higher than the angle of maximum sediment transport (MURRAY \n\nand ASHTON, 2003; ASHTON et al., 2003), which is slightly greater than 45\u00b0 (DEIGAARD et \n\nal., 1988). According to these studies, the longshore sediment flux converges along the crest of \n\nthe perturbation causing accretion that enhances it. Thus, while maximum longshore transport \n\ntends to smooth irregularities in the shoreline shape (KOMAR, 1998), the highest rates of \n\nshoreline changes occur in areas of least sediment transport, especially when deep water waves \n\napproach the shoreline at angles just below 80\u00b0 (MURRAY and ASHTON, 2003). In the RS, the \n\nmean shoreline orientation is around 40\u00b0 along the central sector, favoring the largest \n\nperturbation growth (or the maximum shoreline changes) when waves approach from 210\u00b0 \n\n(SSW) and 50\u00b0 (NE), the strongest and the dominant waves, respectively. It seems that the \n\neffects of high angle waves might explain the oscillations in shoreline changes along the central \n\nsector; however, further analysis is required to test this hypothesis. \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nThe RS coastline has been often described as straight and homogeneous leading \n\nresearchers to accept that results obtained locally are valid for long stretches of the coast. This \n\nstudy has shown that seasonal and interannual variations in the shoreline position exhibit \n\n\n\n 91 \n\ndifferent responses along the three major coastal sectors either in the magnitude of displacements \n\nand/or in the time-scale in which the shoreline returns to a previous position. The largest \n\nshoreline changes and alongshore variability were registered along the central sector, where areas \n\nof erosion alternate with areas of accretion at scales O(30 to 90) km, moving to opposite \n\ndirections in consecutive years. The northern sector is characterized by lower magnitude of \n\nchanges and less alongshore variability as accretion dominates in one year and erosion dominates \n\nin the following year. The southern sector shows a similar response in the southernmost segment \n\nand a dominantly seaward displacement of the shoreline in the northernmost sector. Thus, such \n\nalongshore variability can only be possible if (1) the RS coastline is not homogenous alongshore, \n\n(2) there are gradients of hydrodynamic conditions alongshore, or (3) both. \n\nResults in this study corroborate with previous morphodynamic studies reporting beach \n\naccretion due to the fair weather conditions in the spring-summer months and erosion due to the \n\nmore energetic conditions in the fall-winter months. However, a great variability was observed in \n\nthe annual shoreline changes registered in November (spring), probably due to the strong ENSO \n\nevents coincident with the years of shoreline monitoring. In 1997, a strong El Ni\u00f1o event affected \n\nthe RS coast intensifying winds (and waves) and enhancing storms, resulting in a significant \n\nretreat of the shoreline mapped in November. In 1998, the post-El Ni\u00f1o period was characterized \n\nby reduction in the wind and wave energy allowing the beach to recover, displacing the shoreline \n\nseaward of its 1997 position. The increase in cyclogenesis during the La Ni\u00f1a event of 1999 \n\nforced a retreat of the shoreline from its 1998 position. ENSO events strongly affect southern \n\nBrazil in the spring months (GRIMM, 2003), when shoreline mapping was conducted in 1997, \n\n1998, and 1999. Therefore, the patterns of annual shoreline change described in this study are \n\nprobably influenced by the ENSO effects and whether they represent general conditions for that \n\ntime of the year can only be determined by continued monitoring.  \n\nOne of the most interesting observations of this study was the presence of a mirror image \n\nbetween the annual displacement lines in the central sector, and between the seasonal lines in the \n\nsouthern sector. The same effect was reported by LIST and FARRIS (1999) comparing shoreline \n\nchanges along the Outer Banks (North Carolina, US) and Cape Cod (Massachusetts, US) before \n\nand after a storm. Thus, as the mirror image has been observed for different beaches on varied \n\nshort-time scales (after passage of a storm, seasonally, and annually), the return of the shoreline \n\nto its previous shape and, perhaps, to its original position, might be just a matter of time. An \n\nimportant question requiring much longer time of observations concerns whether or not such \n\nshape and position are dominant through time or merely represent transitory moments between \n\nhighly dynamic states. Thus, the concept of a mean shoreline position might be questioned for \n\ncoastlines characterized by large variability where the definition of the most frequent shoreline \n\nposition at different time-scales may be more appropriate.  \n\n\n\n 92 \n\nThe alongshore differences in the response of the shoreline to seasonal and interannual \n\nchanges is due to a combination of factors interacting in a way that is difficult to ascertain which \n\nis more important. The largest shoreline displacements occur in embayment areas and are \n\nassociated with lower mean grain sizes. Slight variations in the shoreline orientation are \n\ncoincident with variations in the mean grain size and the rhythmic pattern of shoreline changes in \n\nthe central and northern sectors, which are also linked with gradients of LST presented by \n\nmodeling results. The general orientation of the RS coastline favors sediment transport from \n\nsoutherly waves as embayment areas located south of coastal projections are protected from NE \n\nwaves (Hs ? 1.5 m), which are the dominant along the RS coast. The largest net LST is observed \n\nalong shorelines more exposed to the stormy SSW waves where erosion has been often reported \n\n(i.e. south of Albard\u00e3o and in the area from Estreito to Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse). The alternating \n\nerosion and accretion areas observed along the central sector might be an effect of waves \n\napproaching to the shore in angles higher than the angle of maximum sediment transport as \n\ndescribed by MURRAY and ASHTON (2003) and ASHTON et al. (2003). These results are \n\nsupported by modeling that can only be validated when field measurements become available. \n\nThis study has shown that is important to know the variability and magnitude of \n\nshoreline changes in the short-term in order to understand the real meaning of rates of change \n\nbased on few data points (i.e. the end-point method). However, rates of change for the RS coast \n\ncan be estimated only when more data become available. Improved understanding of all the \n\nfactors driving changes in shoreline position over the wide range of space and time scales is \n\nessential for progress in our present ability to predict coastal response to wave climate and \n\nchanging sea level. To achieve this, it is necessary to instigate a program of field measurements \n\nof tides, waves, longshore currents, and sediment transport spanning the RS shoreline with \n\nparticular attention being paid to areas of large magnitudes of shoreline changes identified here. \n\nSuch a study will also generate a unique data set of considerable value for calibration, validation, \n\nand verification of morphodynamic models at an unprecedented scale.  \n\n \n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS \n\nThe authors would like to thank the Centro de Estudos de Geologia Costeira e Oce\u00e2nica \n\n(CECO/UFRGS) e Instituto de Pesquisas Hidr\u00e1ulicas (IPH/UFRGS) for providing the DGPS \n\ndata.

The state Program of \n\nCoastal Management is incipient and has addressed only the northern coastal sector, which \n\nconcentrates most of the developed beaches in the state. The central and southern coastal sectors \n\nshow ideal conditions to the implementation of a regional management plan based on measures \n\nthat regulate occupation and uses. This study identifies classes of management for RS beaches \n\nbased on: (a) rates of population growth from 1991 to 2000, (b) intensity of beachfront \n\ndevelopment and the state of conservation of the beach system, (c) shoreline changes from 1997 \n\nto 2002, and (d) coastal evolution in the Holocene. Four classes of management are defined: (1) \n\ncritical areas, are highly developed or show a recent trend of increasing population, are eroding \n\nor accreting with large magnitudes of shoreline changes, and require corrective measures; (2) \n\npriority areas, are low to moderately developed but show a potential for intensification of \n\noccupation and uses in the near future, are eroding and show large magnitudes of shoreline \n\nmovements, they require urgent regulation to restrict development and uses; (3) areas of future \n\nconcern, are not under pressure at present and consist of eroding shores located close to critical \n\nor priority areas, regulation measures are recommended, and (4) natural areas, are mainly \n\npreserved, eroding or accreting, with no signs of changes in the near future. About 198 km (32% \n\nof the RS coastal length) are classified as priority areas (located along the central sector), 178 km \n\n(29%) as natural areas (in the southern coast of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte and between Cassino and \n\nAlbard\u00e3o), 177 km (29%) as critical areas (northern sector, Cassino, and between Chu\u00ed and \n\nHermenegildo), and 65 km (10%) as areas of future concern (beaches from Hermenegildo to \n\nAlbard\u00e3o).  \n\n \n\nAdditional Index Words: beach erosion, DGPS, coastal management \n\n \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe impacts of growing population and development along the coastal zones worldwide \n\nhave been greatly discussed in the literature (e.g. Cendrero, 1989; Turner et al., 1996; Nicholls &amp; \n\nSmall, 2002; United Nations, 2003). Recent estimates show that 1.2 billion people are living \n\nwithin 100 km of the shoreline in altitudes below 100 m, where population densities are about 3 \n\ntimes higher than the global average (Small &amp; Nicholls, 2003). The low-lying coastal areas are \n\nexposed to a variety of natural hazards (e.g. Small &amp; Nicholls, 2003; Doornkamp, 1998; Turner \n\net al., 1996) that have caused millions of deaths in the last centuries and are increasingly \n\naffecting the economic development of coastal communities as population increases (Small &amp; \n\n\n\n 101 \n\nNicholls, 2003). Considering that population growth along the coast is a current process and \n\neconomic development is desirable, in the last decade major efforts have been applied to \n\nimplement programs based on integrated coastal management (ICM) principles. The ICM aims \n\nto define strategies to promote sustainable use, development, and protection of the coastal and \n\nmarine resources, addressing conflicts of use to search for the harmonization between the \n\nphysical environment and human activities (Cicin-Sain &amp; Knecht, 1998). However, \n\nimplementation of ICM requires a certain degree of understanding about the environment from \n\nwhich its interrelationships with socio-economic and cultural assets can be drawn and the \n\npotential for use or preservation can be determined.  \n\nUnderstanding coastal processes and beach morphodynamics to forecast shoreline \n\nchanges in the future is not only a scientific goal but also a requirement to support coastal \n\nmanagement plans (Galgano &amp; Leatherman, 1991; Honeycutt et al., 2001; Pajak &amp; Leatherman, \n\n2002). ICM is more efficient when established at a regional scale (Stockdon et al., 2002) mainly \n\nbecause coastal processes are continuous alongshore and changes at one place can cause a range \n\nof effects in adjacent coastal and marine environments. Therefore, the need to provide \n\ninformation useful for coastal managers associated with the new technology that allows detailed \n\ndata collection in large areas resulted in a shift in the interest from local to regional studies. \n\nResults from monitoring efforts at a regional scale have supported implementation of \n\nmanagement plans at state (such as in the US states of Florida, New Jersey, California, etc.) and \n\nnational levels (such as in the Netherlands). In Brazil, the National Plan of Coastal Management \n\n(Plano Nacional de Gerenciamento Costeiro, PNGC) was officially created in 1988 (Law 7.661, \n\nfrom 16/05/88) and detailed in 1990 by Resolution No. 01/90 of the Comiss\u00e3o Interministerial \n\npara Recursos do Mar (CIRM). The PNGC is available online at the Minist\u00e9rio do Meio \n\nAmbiente (MMA) web site (http://www.mma.gov.br/port/sqa/projeto/gerco/planocac.html). The \n\nestablishment of the PNGC has increased the interest of government authorities and scientists on \n\ncoastal monitoring, resulting in the development of several large-scale projects. Examples of \n\nintegrated coastal projects at national level are Orla and Atlas of Coastal Erosion (supported by \n\nthe Minist\u00e9rio do Planejamento) and at a regional/international level there is the project Coastal \n\nErosion: Causes, Risk Analysis and its Relation with the Genesis of Mineral Resources \n\n(supported by the Organization of the American States), addressing the coast of Rio Grande do \n\nSul (RS), Uruguay, and Argentina (Martins et al., 2002). \n\nThe implementation of ICM is a complex process based on the interrelationships \n\nbetween the physical environment, natural resources, societal demands, economic, and cultural \n\naspects (NOAA, http://icm.noaa.gov/story/icm_mgt.html). Thus, this study does not intend to \n\npresent a comprehensive evaluation of all the major aspects addressed in a management plan. \n\nThe main goal here is to describe, at a regional level, the present conditions of the RS coast based \n\n\n\n 102 \n\non factors that are important to define classes of management, including: rates of population \n\ngrowth from 1991 to 2000, intensity of beachfront development, the state of conservation of the \n\ndune-beach system, short-term shoreline changes, and coastal evolution in the long term. The RS \n\ncoast is then classified into four classes of management, defined as areas of critical management, \n\npriority areas, areas of future concern, and natural areas. \n\n \n\nMETHODS \n\nThe objective of this study is to define classes of management along the RS beaches \n\nbased on: \n\n(1) rates of population growth from 1991 to 2000 provided by the Instituto Brasileiro de \n\nGeografia e Estat\u00edstica (IBGE), available at \n\nhttp://www2.ibge.gov.br/pub/Censos/Censo_Demografico_2000), \n\n(2) intensity of beachfront development and the state of conservation of the beach system \n\naccording to data presented in Esteves et al. (2003a). In this study, developed beaches \n\nrefer to areas where at least 30% of the beachfront length is developed,  \n\n(3) shoreline change rates estimated for the period 1997 to 2002 by the linear regression \n\nmethod applied to shoreline position data obtained from DGPS monitoring (Esteves et \n\nal., 2003b, 2004a), and \n\n(4) coastal evolution in the Holocene according to Dillenburg et al. (2000).  \n\nConsidering the parameters above, a regional analysis was conducted to classify the RS \n\nbeaches into four classes of coastal management as follows: \n\nI. Critical areas include highly developed beaches that show a recent trend of increasing \n\npopulation growth, occupation, and use; are subjected to erosion and/or destruction of \n\ncoastal structures during storms or are accreting but magnitudes of shoreline changes \n\nexceed the mean width of the dry beach; foredunes were destructed or considerably \n\nreduced; corrective management is required. \n\nII. Priority areas are under growing pressure where urge the implementation of \n\nmanagement plans based on regulation and restriction of development and uses; coastal \n\ndevelopment can be low or moderate; rates of population growth are usually above the \n\nstate\u2019 s average; there is evidence of recent intensification of uses (tourism, values of real \n\nestate, demand for resources, conflicts of uses); beaches are eroding in the long or short \n\nterm and show large magnitudes of shoreline movements. Priority areas usually are (a) \n\nadjacent to areas of ecological importance (i.e. National Parks), (b) close to critical areas, \n\nand/or (c) had access recently facilitated or created. \n\n\n\n 103 \n\nIII. Areas of future concern have a preserved or nearly preserved beach/dune system; are \n\nmainly undeveloped; are usually eroding or show large magnitudes of shoreline \n\nmovements; are not under great pressure at present but preventive measures are \n\nrecommended to avoid development in hazardous areas.  \n\nIV. Natural areas have their natural characteristics preserved, are undeveloped, show low \n\npressure of use and no signs of increasing pressure in the near future, and can be eroding, \n\nstable or accreting.  \n\n \n\nSTUDY AREA \n\nThe RS shoreline is dominated by exposed sandy beaches. This shore is part of a large \n\ncoastal plain that was formed and shaped by Quaternary sea level fluctuations resulting in a \n\ncomplex system of coastal lakes and lagoons (Villwock et al., 1986). The lagoon system traps \n\nsediments from fluvial discharge, reducing the sand volume reaching the shore (Tomazelli et al., \n\n1998). Waves are the main hydrodynamic process along the RS coast where the maximum tidal \n\nvariation is 0.5 m (Tomazelli et al., 1998). Waves from east and northeast dominate but southerly \n\nwaves are the strongest and determine a net longshore sediment transport to the north (Esteves et \n\nal., 2004a). This coast is often affected by storms associated with the passage of cold fronts, \n\nespecially in fall and winter months (Calliari et al., 1998).  \n\nIn the State Program of Coastal Management (GERCO/RS), the State Foundation of \n\nEnvironmental Protection (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Estadual de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o Ambiental, FEPAM) divided the RS \n\ncoast into four major sectors: (a) the northern, (b) the central-east, and (c) the southern include \n\ncoastal municipalities along the ocean and municipalities that are adjacent to them, and (d) the \n\ncentral-west includes municipalities along the western margin of the Patos Lagoon (FEPAM, \n\n2000). This study addresses only the 16 municipalities along the ocean coast, dividing them \n\naccording to the GERCO/RS sectors, except that Rio Grande is included in the southern sector. \n\nThus, here the RS coast is divided into three sectors (Fig. 6.1): (1) the northern sector extends \n\nabout 120 km south of the Santa Catarina state border and includes the highly developed beaches \n\nof Torres, Arroio do Sal, Terra de Areia, Cap\u00e3o da Canoa, Xangril\u00e1, Os\u00f3rio, Imb\u00e9, Tramanda\u00ed, \n\nCidreira, and Balne\u00e1rio Pinhal; (2) the central sector comprises the mainly undeveloped beaches \n\nof Palmares do Sul, Mostardas, Tavares, and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte, and is limited south by the Patos \n\nLagoon inlet, and (3) the southern sector extends 220 km from the Patos Lagoon inlet to Chu\u00ed at \n\nthe Uruguayan border, and includes the shores of  Rio Grande and Santa Vit\u00f3ria do Palmar. \n\nAspects of population growth, beachfront development and uses, coastal evolution, and shoreline \n\nchanges in the short-term are described in the next sections.  \n\n \n\n\n\n 104 \n\n \n\nCOASTAL POPULATION GROWTH IN RIO GRANDE DO SUL \n\nThe encroachment of population along the coast is a world process that has been \n\naggravated with time, increasing the number of people exposed to natural hazards (e.g., Nicholls \n\n&amp; Small, 2002). Brazil is no exception to the rule, as population density decreases considerably \n\nfrom east to west and from south to north (Moraes, 1995). A regional analysis indicates that the \n\nnon-coastal Northern and Central-West regions presented the fastest population growth in Brazil \n\nfrom 1991 to 2000. However, a detailed analysis shows that the coastal population grew faster \n\nthan the average of their respective states, except in Par\u00e1, Rio de Janeiro, and Sergipe. The RS \n\ncan be described as atypical amongst other Brazilian coastal states, as colonization started inland \n\nand population density at the coast is lower than the state\u2019 s average (Moraes, 1995). At present, \n\nonly about 4.5% of the RS population live in coastal cities, but seven of the ten municipalities \n\nshowing larger population growth from 1991 to 2000 are located at the coast (Esteves et al., \n\n2003a). These municipalities show mean annual rates of population growth four to six times \n\ngreater than the state\u2019 s average, representing an increase from 54% to 91% of their total \n\npopulation (Table 6.1). \n\nConsidering the mean annual rates of population growth from 1991 to 2000, the sixteen \n\ncoastal municipalities in RS can be divided into three groups: (1) group I includes the seven \n\nmunicipalities showing rates above 4%: Balne\u00e1rio Pinhal, Cidreira, Tramanda\u00ed, Imb\u00e9, Xangril\u00e1, \n\nCap\u00e3o da Canoa, and Arroio do Sal (all located in the northern sector); (2) group II comprises \n\nfour municipalities showing rates of population growth around 2-3% (still above the state\u2019 s \n\nFigure 6.1. The study area showing three major coastal sectors of Rio Grande do Sul: (a) northern, (b) \n\ncentral, and (c) southern. \n\n\n\n 105 \n\naverage) and includes: Torres and Os\u00f3rio (in the northern sector) and Mostardas and Palmares do \n\nSul (in the central sector); and (3) group III includes municipalities showing rates of population \n\ngrowth between 0.5% and 1.1% (below the state\u2019 s average), which are Terra de Areia, Tavares, \n\nS\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte, Rio Grande, and Santa Vit\u00f3ria do Palmar (Table 6.1). It is clear from these \n\ngroups that the geographic location along the coast strongly determines the rate of population \n\ngrowth in RS coastal municipalities. The ones included in group I are all located in the northern \n\nsector (and are amongst the ten fastest growing in the state). Conversely, the four southernmost \n\ncoastal municipalities are included in group III (Tavares, S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte, Rio Grande, and \n\nSanta Vit\u00f3ria do Palmar).  \n\n \n\nTable 6.1.

Few urban areas and small fishing \n\nvillages account for less than 30 km of developed beaches present along the southern and central \n\ncoastal sectors. The difference in the intensity of development along the state shoreline is due to \n\ntwo factors: (a) the distance from the largest populated areas in RS (i.e., the metropolitan area of \n\nPorto Alegre and the Northeast region), and (b) the facility of road access to the coast (Esteves et \n\nal., 2003a). The northern coastal sector is close to the most densely populated areas of the state \n\nand can be easily reached at least by two fast routes (BR101 or RS786). The central sector is \n\nlocated in a coastal barrier that separates the Patos Lagoon of the Atlantic Ocean (Fig. 6.1), so \n\nthe access from inland to the coast is impeded by the presence of the lagoon. In the north-south \n\ndirection, the central sector can be reached through the recently paved BR101 (except the \n\nsouthernmost 50 km) linking Mostardas and Tavares to the northern sector. The beaches of S\u00e3o \n\nJos\u00e9 do Norte can only be accessed driving along the beach or through the unpaved BR101 \n\nwhich is well-known due to its bad conditions especially after rainfalls. The southern sector is \n\nlocated in one of the least developed areas of the RS, and access exists only to the developed \n\nbeaches of Cassino (at the northernmost end), Hermenegildo, and Chu\u00ed (at the southernmost \n\nend). West-east access to most of this shoreline is hampered by the presence of Mangueira \n\nlagoon and large wetlands (i.e., Taim). So the only access to about 200 km of undeveloped \n\ncoastline is driving along the beach. \n\n \n\nTable 6.2. Classification of the Rio Grande do Sul shorelines according to the length of \n\ndeveloped shorelines, development on top of the dunes, afforestation, and altered (impacted) \n\nshores. \n\nCoastal Sector Length Developed beaches Developed Dunes Afforestation Altered Shores \n\n km km % km %1 km % km % \n\nNorthern 123 94.3 76.7 51.6 54.7 47.72 38.8 98.1 79.8 \n\nCentral 275 21.1 7.7 10.6 50.2 59.3 21.6 40.3 14.7 \n\nSouthern 220 8.0 3.6 4.2 52.5 63.7 28.9 56.7 25.8 \n\nTotal 618 123.4 19.9 66.4 53.8 170.7 27.6 195.1 31.6 \n\n1Percentage refers to the length of urbanized shores  \n2Includes landscaping at the dunes and introduction of exotic vegetation \n\nModified from Esteves et al. (2003a) \n\n\n\n 107 \n\nCoastal development in the northern sector consists mainly in second houses which are \n\noccupied only in the summer months, when seasonal population increases considerably. Thus, \n\nmost services and business are active only from December to March, responding to the \n\nfluctuations in the seasonal population. Along the central sector, fishing villages are more \n\nimportant than tourist resorts and tourism along this shoreline is often related to fishing activities. \n\nOne of the major attractions in the central sector is the Lagoa do Peixe National Park, one of the \n\nmost important sanctuaries of migratory birds in South America (Ramsar, 2002). This Park has \n\nan area of 34,400 ha where 182 species of birds can be seen, including 26 species of migratory \n\nbirds from the Northern Hemisphere and 5 species from the Southern Hemisphere, apart from \n\nother animals such as capivaras (Hydrochoerus hydrochoeris) and one endangered species of \n\nalligator (Caiman latirostris). Despite its natural attractions, the Park receives only about 2,500 \n\nvisitors per year (Ramsar, 2002), probably due to the difficult access and the lack of \n\ninfrastructure for tourists. In the southern sector, Cassino beach concentrates beach goers from \n\ninland cities located in southern RS, while Hermenegildo and Balne\u00e1rio Chu\u00ed are occupied by \n\nlocal population of Santa Vit\u00f3ria do Palmar and Chu\u00ed, respectively, and few tourists from \n\nUruguay. Traffic along the beach is common between these beaches. In this sector, there is the \n\nTaim Ecological Station, a wetland protected by law that serves as natural habitat for wildlife, \n\nincluding migratory birds, capivaras, and the endandered Caiman latirostris.  \n\nAbout 54% of the beachfront properties in RS were built on top of the dunes (Table 6.2), \n\nresulting in the removal of the vegetation and partial or total destruction of the frontal dunes. \n\nCoastal protection works such as revetments and seawalls are a common sight along retreated \n\nbeaches (i.e. Cidreira, Balne\u00e1rio Pinhal, and Hermenegildo), especially where frontal dunes were \n\ndestructed. In some beaches, projects of dunes reconstruction have been implemented (i.e., \n\nAtl\u00e2ntida Sul, Imb\u00e9, and Cassino). Afforestation of Pinus elliotis too close to the beach is another \n\nactivity that has been affecting the local water table (Seeliger et al., 2000) and dunes dynamics \n\n(Silva &amp; Tagliani, 2000) along the southern and central sectors. The impact of such activity on \n\nthe sediment balance in the short and long terms is still unknown. Extraction of heavy minerals \n\nfrom the dunes in the area of Bujuru (central sector) is another potential impact on the local \n\nbeach system. In 1998, a project to extract ilmenite from the dunes in Bujuru (an investment of \n\nabout U$ 516 million to produce synthetic pigments of rutile and titanium) was halted by federal \n\nattorneys (Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico Federal) due to environmental concerns. Another economic \n\nactivity that affects the RS shoreline is the development of the Port of Rio Grande located at the \n\nPatos Lagoon estuary. It is the third largest port in Brazil and the most important for the trade \n\nbetween MERCOSUL countries. At present, the two 4-km long jetties that fix the navigation \n\nchannel are scheduled to be extended in association with the deepening of the channel to allow \n\nlarger ships to access the port. Therefore, although the RS coastline is mainly undeveloped, \n\n\n\n 108 \n\naccording to Esteves et al. (2003a) several human activities have impacted this shore, altering the \n\nnatural conditions along 31.6% of its length (Table 6.2). According to the FEPAM, the major \n\nenvironmental problems along the RS coast are: (1) drainage of wetlands (for irrigation \n\npurposes), (2) removal of the dunes vegetation, (3) destruction of the active dunes, (4) \n\nafforestation of exotic plants, (5) unplanned occupation along the lagoon margins, (6) drainage, \n\nland reclamation, and private ownership of the lagoon margins and wetlands, (7) water pollution \n\nby domestic sewage, (8) inadequate agriculture and use of pesticides in areas occupied by the \n\nAtlantic Forest, (9) pressure of urban, industrial, and port development on the Patos Lagoon, (10) \n\nconflicts on the demand of water usage, and (11) solid waste management (FEPAM, \n\nhttp://www.fepam.rs.gov.br/qualidade/litoranea.asp).  \n\n \n\nSHORELINE CHANGES IN THE LONG AND SHORT TERMS \n\nThe long-term changes in shoreline position are presented here as the evolution of \n\ncoastal barriers in the last 5 ka described by Dillenburg et al. (2000). Data on short-term \n\nshoreline changes are based on (a) DGPS shoreline monitoring from 1997 to 2002 (Esteves et al., \n\n2003b, 2004a) and (b) analysis of aerial photos taken in 1974, 1989, and 2000 (Esteves et al., \n\n2004b). Results from these studies are summarized here to describe the long-term trends and \n\nshort-term magnitudes of the shoreline changes in RS. \n\nAccording to Dillenburg et al. (2000), progradation of coastal barriers in the Holocene \n\noccurred along concave shorelines (large-scale coastal embayments) where substrate is gentler, \n\nand barrier retreat occurred along convex shorelines (projections) where substrate is steeper. \n\nThus, the alongshore variability in the barriers behavior can be explained by long-term gradients \n\nof wave energy caused by the shape of the shoreline and the steepness of the inner shelf \n\n(Dillenburg et al., 2004). In the northern sector, a long-term barrier progradation was observed \n\nfrom Torres to Tramanda\u00ed and stability from Tramanda\u00ed to Mostardas (Dillenburg et al., 2000). \n\nRates of shoreline change obtained from the DGPS monitoring and from aerial photos also show \n\nbeach accretion from Torres to Xangril\u00e1 although indicate a trend to stability from Xangril\u00e1 to \n\nTramanda\u00ed and to erosion southwards (Esteves et al., 2004b). These results suggest that the area \n\nfrom Xangril\u00e1 to Tramanda\u00ed represents a transition between the barrier to the north that is \n\naccreting in the long and short terms and the barrier to the south that is stable in the long term \n\nand eroding in the short term. This shift in the trends of coastal changes is also evidenced by the \n\nwidth of the modern transgressive dune fields (Esteves et al., 2004b). South of Xangril\u00e1 the \n\ntransgressive dune fields are wider then in the north, covering the entire Holocene barrier and \n\nextending on top of the Pleistocene barrier from Tramanda\u00ed to Mostardas (Dillenburg et al., \n\n2000; 2004).  \n\n\n\n 109 \n\nAlong the central sector, receded barriers dominate from Mostardas to Estreito while \n\nprogradation occurred from Estreito to Verga lighthouse in the Holocene (Dillenburg et al., \n\n2000). Evidence of long-term erosion in this segment includes exhumation of relict lagoonal \n\nmuds and peat along 60 km of beaches around the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse to Estreito and the \n\ndestruction of the Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse during a storm in 1993, where foredunes scarps have \n\nretreated in an average rate of 2.5 m a-1 from 1975 to 1995 (Tomazelli et al., 1998). Analysis of \n\nDGPS data shows that annual shoreline changes along the central sector are characterized by \n\noscillatory movements, with alternating adjacent areas of erosion and accretion occurring at \n\nscales in the order of 30 km to 90 km (Esteves et al., 2004a). Thus, rates of change in the short-\n\nterm vary accordingly to the time interval comprised by the data, especially when estimated by \n\nthe end-point method (Esteves et al., 2003b, 2004a). Accretion was observed from 1997 to 2002 \n\nalong the beaches from Concei\u00e7\u00e3o lighthouse to Estreito, while erosion was registered when rates \n\nwere estimated by the end-point method for the 1998 to 2002 period (Esteves et al., 2004a). \n\nAdditionally, magnitudes of changes tend to be greater along the central sector than in the other \n\ncoastal segments, enhancing the importance of short-term changes to define management \n\nstrategies for this sector. \n\nIn the southern sector, long-term coastal evolution was dominated by progradation in the \n\nembayment between Estreito and Verga lighthouse, stability from Verga to Albard\u00e3o lighthouse, \n\nand erosion from Albard\u00e3o to Chu\u00ed (Dillenburg et al., 2000). In the short term, accretion was \n\nregistered from Estreito to Albard\u00e3o while alternating areas of erosion and accretion in the order \n\nof 200 m to 1.5 km occur south of Albard\u00e3o. In the area of Hermenegildo beach, a 5-km long \n\nerosion spot is present (from 10.3 km to 15.3 km north of Chu\u00ed). Longer segments showing \n\naccretion (in the order of 6 km and one 19-km long segment) occur in a 40-km long coastal \n\nstretch starting at 36 km north of Chu\u00ed. This segment is coincident with the area known as \n\nConcheiros do Albard\u00e3o, where bimodal sediments formed by fine sands and bioclastic gravel \n\n(shell fragments) dominate (Calliari &amp; Klein, 1993). \n\n \n\nIDENTIFICATION OF MANAGEMENT CLASSES \n\nIn this section, RS beaches are classified into four classes of management according to \n\ntheir present conditions of population growth, coastal development and uses, coastal evolution, \n\nand short-term shoreline changes as described above. Classes of management are: (1) critical, (2) \n\npriority, (3) future concern, and (4) natural, which are detailed in the Methods section. The \n\nanalysis was conducted in a municipal to regional level and the results are presented in five maps \n\nat the approximate scale of 1:450,000 for the northern (Fig. 6.2 and 6.3) and central sectors (Fig. \n\n6.3 and 6.4) and 1:400,000 for the southern sector (Fig. 6.5 and 6.6).  \n\n\n\n 110 \n\nNorthern Sector \n\nMunicipalities along the northern coastal sector show rates of population growth higher \n\nthan the state\u2019 s average, (groups I and II, Table 6.1), Terra de Areia (group III, Table 6.1). \n\nObserve that the two lowest rates of population growth in the northern sector (Os\u00f3rio and Terra \n\nde Areia) occur in municipalities that have the shortest shoreline length in the state, only 3-km \n\nlong (Table 6.3), indicating that they might be less dependent on beach activities than other \n\ncoastal municipalities. About 77% of the beachfront along the northern sector are moderately or \n\nhighly developed and beach uses are intense in the summer months, resulting in a shoreline that \n\nis mainly altered (Table 6.2). About 55% of beachfront development occurs in foredunes areas \n\n(Table 6.2), which have been totally removed along the most intensely developed beaches, such \n\nas Tramanda\u00ed, Imb\u00e9, and Cap\u00e3o da Canoa. In eroding beaches, constructions on top of the \n\nforedunes are usually protected by seawalls or revetments such as in Cidreira and Balne\u00e1rio \n\nPinhal. Undeveloped beaches consist mainly in short segments (usually 300 m to 500 m long) \n\nbetween adjacent developed areas, although longer segments exist as shown in figure 6.2.  \n\nBeaches in the northern sector are classified as areas of critical management (Fig. 6.2 \n\nFigure 6.2.  Beaches from Torres to Cidreira (northern coastal sector) are classified as areas of critical \n\nmanagement. These beaches are highly developed, mainly prograding in the long term, while eroding \n\nbeaches dominate south of Xangril\u00e1 in the short term. Areas presenting alternating short segments of \n\nerosion and accretion are represented as areas of variable shoreline changes. \n\n\n\n 111 \n\nand 6.3), where corrective measures are already needed to mitigate impacts of unplanned \n\noccupation. However, these beaches show different trends of shoreline change in the long and \n\nshort terms. Figure 6.2 shows that a long-term barrier progradation dominates along the northern \n\ncoastal sector with a trend to stability south of Tramanda\u00ed (Dillenburg et al., 2000), while \n\nshoreline changes in the short term indicate beach accretion dominating from Torres to Xangril\u00e1 \n\nand erosion to the south (Esteves et al., 2003b). It is worth to emphasize that alternating areas of \n\nerosion and accretion occur along this shoreline, so short segments of eroded beaches occur in \n\nthe areas where accretion dominates and vice-versa. Due to restrains of the scale, alternating \n\nareas of erosion and accretion are represented in figure 6.2 as areas of variable shoreline changes. \n\nTable 6.3 shows mean annual rates of shoreline change estimated for the 1997 to 2002 period for \n\neach coastal municipality and discriminate the length and percentage of accreted, eroded, and \n\nstable segments. From Torres to Xangril\u00e1, the mean shoreline change rates are always positive \n\n(accretion), and eroded segments occur in less than one third of the shoreline length (Table 6.3). \n\nFrom Os\u00f3rio (Fig. 6.2) to Balne\u00e1rio Pinhal (Fig. 6.3), mean annual rates are negative (erosion) \n\nand eroded segments occur along most of the shoreline length, except for Tramanda\u00ed that has a \n\nmean annual rate equal zero and erosion in nearly 45% of the shoreline length (Table 6.3). \n\nAdditionally, magnitudes of shoreline change tend to be larger from Cidreira to the south than \n\nalong the northernmost beaches (Esteves et al, 2004a) as displayed in figures 6.2 and 6.3. \n\nTherefore, coastal management needs to be addressed differently and implemented more urgently \n\nin the area of Os\u00f3rio to Balne\u00e1rio Pinhal than in the beaches from Xangril\u00e1 to Torres. \n\n \n\nCentral Sector \n\nAt present, only 21.1 km or 7.7% of the shoreline along the central sector is developed \n\n(Table 6.2), concentrated mainly along the beaches of Palmares do Sul and few small fishing \n\nvillages spread to the south (Fig. 6.3). The two northern municipalities, Palmares do Sul and \n\nMostardas, had mean annual rates of population growth above 2% from 1991 to 2000 (group II, \n\nTable 6.1), while the two southern municipalities, Tavares and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte, showed rates \n\nof population growth below 1%, amongst the lowest along the coast (group III, Table 6.1). \n\nAccess to these beaches was difficult until 1998 when the BR101 started to be paved linking \n\nPalmares do Sul and Mostardas to the most populated areas in the state. According to Page \n\n(1998), intensification of tourism and recreation depends on the transport infrastructure, in a way \n\nthat easy access and good road conditions usually result in over exploitation of resources. Thus, \n\nthe recently paved road provides easy access to the mainly undeveloped shore of Palmares do \n\nSul, Mostardas, and Tavares what might enhance tourism and development in a pristine area \n\ncharacterized by dunes, wetlands, and lagoons, including the Lagoa do Peixe National Park. \n\n\n\n 112 \n\nConversely, the unpaved southernmost 50 km of the BR101 makes access difficult to the beaches \n\nof S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte inhibiting development and tourism in this area.  \n\n \n\nTable 6.3.

Important to reinforce here that shoreline changes along \n\nthe central sector are characterized by alternating areas of erosion and accretion that have shown \n\nopposite trends in consecutive years (Esteves et al., 2004a). Considering that 100% of the \n\nPalmares do Sul shoreline is eroding (Table 6.3), its high rate of population growth (Table 6.1), \n\n\n\n 113 \n\nthe potential for increasing pressure in the next few years due to the proximity of the developed \n\nbeaches of the northern sector, and the recently paved road, this shore is classified as critical \n\nareas (Fig. 6.3). The mainly undeveloped beaches from Mostardas (Fig. 6.3 and 6.4) to Estreito \n\nin S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte (Fig. 6.4) are classified as priority areas. Unplanned occupation in these \n\nareas should be avoided through delimitation of risk zones and setback lines for coastal \n\nconstructions because these beaches (a) are eroding in the short (i.e. Mostardas) or in the long \n\nterm (i.e. from Mostardas to Estreito), (b) are subject to large magnitudes of shoreline changes, \n\n(c) show lower pressure of development and less impacted beaches but the recently paved BR101 \n\nhas facilitated access to an area of pristine beaches, (d) are adjacent to areas of environmental \n\nprotection (i.e. Lagoa do Peixe National Park), or (e) show potential for mineral extraction (i.e., \n\nheavy minerals in Bujuru). Beaches south of Estreito are accreting in the short and long terms, \n\nare mainly undeveloped, show low rates of population growth, and have difficult access. These \n\ncharacteristics indicate natural areas (Fig. 6.4) showing low risk of increasing pressure in the \n\nnear future. However, these beaches should be monitored to evaluate the effects of afforestation \n\nnear the dunes and the impact of the jetties at the Patos Lagoon mouth on the sediment budget.  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.3. Beaches from Cidreira (northern coastal sector) to Palmares do Sul (central sector) are \n\nclassified as areas of critical management, while beaches of Mostardas are classified as priority areas. \n\nAlthough these beaches are stable in the long term, they are mainly eroding in the short term. \n\n\n\n 114 \n\nSouthern Sector \n\nIn the southern segment, only 8 km or 3.6% of the shoreline length is developed (Table \n\n6.2) concentrated mainly at the northernmost (Fig. 6.5) and southernmost ends (Fig. 6.6). In \n\nSanta Vit\u00f3ria do Palmar, developed beaches represent 2.3% of the shoreline length and occur \n\nfrom Barra do Chu\u00ed to Hermenegildo, where beachfront properties are built on top of the dunes \n\n(Esteves et al., 2003a). In Cassino and Quer\u00eancia (Rio Grande), the well-developed dunes have \n\nshown a decrease in size and height partly because they were often cut to facilitate the access of \n\nvehicles to the beach and used as sand source for land fill or construction uses. Since 1986, \n\nprojects of dune restoration have recovered the dunes along 2.5 km of the Cassino beach \n\n(NEMA, http://www.octopus.furg.br/nema/dunas/dunas.htm). Santa Vit\u00f3ria do Palmar and Rio \n\nGrande show rates of population growth lower than the state\u2019 s average 0.72% and 0.89%, \n\nrespectively (group III, Table 6.1). There are no signs of enhancing population growth or \n\ndevelopment along the southern sector in the near future as the access is difficult to great part of \n\nthis shoreline and southern RS is one of the most undeveloped areas in the state. Possibly, the \n\nonly change the southern coast may experience is related to the expansion of the Rio Grande \n\nPort, what can cause some impact in Cassino beach. The consequences of unplanned occupation \n\nFigure 6.4. The shores from Mostardas to Estreito, in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte (central sector), are classified as \n\npriority areas as they are eroding in the long and/or in the short term. Beaches south of Estreito are \n\naccreting in the long and short terms and are classified as natural areas but the impacts of the jetties the \n\nafforestations on the local sediment budget and dynamics of the beach system should be better evaluated. \n\n\n\n 115 \n\nare reflected by the destruction of coastal properties during storms in Hermenegildo, and by \n\nbeach traffic and contamination of coastal waters in the summer in Cassino. The use of the \n\nundeveloped beaches in this segment is minor, showing some traffic along the beach and fishing \n\nactivities (commercial boats and line fishing). The major human activity along this shoreline is \n\nthe presence of Pinus elliotis afforestations located too close to the active dunes extending along \n\nabout 64 km alongshore (Table 6.2).  \n\nFrom Rio Grande to Albard\u00e3o lighthouse, beach accretion has dominated in the long and \n\nshort terms (Fig. 6.5). South of Albard\u00e3o, barrier retreat has been observed in the last 5 ka and \n\nalternating areas of erosion and accretion were registered from 1997 to 2002 (Fig. 6.6). The \n\nnorthernmost 15 km are classified as area of critical management (Fig. 6.5) due to the alteration \n\nin the natural conditions caused by human activities (e.g. beach traffic, jetties, destruction of \n\ndunes, pollution). A great part of the southern sector (about 124 km) is classified as natural areas \n\nas beaches are undeveloped, there is no evidence of increasing population or occupation, and \n\nthere is a trend to accretion in the short and long terms (Fig. 6.5 and 6.6). However, further \n\nFigure 6.5. The northernmost 15 km of the Rio Grande coastline (southern sector) are classified as critical \n\nareas due to the alteration of the beach-dune system while other beaches are classified as natural areas. \n\nHowever, the impacts of afforestations too close to the dunes should be better evaluated to determine \n\nwhether a setback line should be implemented for this activity. \n\n\n\n 116 \n\nstudies are required to assess the potential impacts of the afforestation too close to the beach and \n\nto determine whether a setback line should be applied to this activity. The proximity of these \n\nbeaches to the Taim Ecological Station support regulatory measures to restrict uses that would \n\npose a threat to the preservation of the wetland. This could be implemented either by extending \n\nthe preservation area to incorporate the beach or restricting uses to activities such as ecotourism, \n\nwhich are usually less damaging to the environment and could be taxed to provide financial \n\nresources to support management of the area. About 65 km of undeveloped beaches between \n\nAlbard\u00e3o and Hermenegildo are classified as areas of future concern (Fig. 6.6), where regulation \n\nshould restrict occupation along eroded beaches. The southernmost 16 km are classified as \n\ncritical areas (Fig. 6.6) due to the impacts of unplanned occupation adjacent to eroded shorelines, \n\nincluding undeveloped beaches where regulations of beach use and occupation should be \n\nimplemented. Beach erosion has threatened Hermenegildo resulting in economic degradation due \n\nto costs of coastal protection, destruction of structures during storms, and depreciation of \n\nbeachfront property values (Esteves &amp; Santos, 2001). Although Barra do Chu\u00ed is located \n\ndowndrift of a stabilized inlet, it is not experiencing significant erosion in the short term, \n\nprobably due to the bidirectional character of the longshore currents (Nicolodi et al., 2000; \n\nEsteves et al., 2004a) and the short extension of the jetty.  \n\n \n\nFigure 6.6. Along the shores of Santa Vit\u00f3ria do Palmar, the beaches from Verga to Albard\u00e3o are classified \n\nas natural areas, from Albard\u00e3o to Hermenegildo beaches are classified as areas of future concern, and \n\nfrom Hermenegildo to Chu\u00ed as areas of critical management. \n\n\n\n 117 \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nAccording to Moraes (1995), occupation along the Brazilian coast is a recent process that \n\nis mainly unplanned and chaotic demanding major efforts in corrective management. The author \n\nemphasizes that the fragility of the coastal ecosystems and the pressure of accelerated \n\ndevelopment set priority for management plans in two areas: (a) in the surroundings of \n\nestablished urban centers, and (b) the creation of new development in pristine coasts. These two \n\nconditions are represented in RS especially by the northern coastal sector and the northern half of \n\nthe central sector, respectively. Development is intense along the northern coastal sector and the \n\nconsequences of unplanned occupation have been aggravated by the accelerated population \n\ngrowth in the last decade. As problems due to the increase in the demand for resources and space \n\nalong the northern sector are exacerbated, tourists tend to escape to the nearest available area, i.e. \n\nthe central sector. The central coastal sector has shown a recent trend of accelerating population \n\ngrowth and new developments are to be established in pristine areas. Although both areas need \n\nurgent implementation of management plans, the northern sector demands mainly corrective \n\nmeasures while the central sector requires preventive management. Preventive management is \n\nusually more effective, less expensive and easier to implement than corrective measures and \n\ntends to reduce critical areas in the future. However, preventive management is usually applied to \n\nareas where development is absent or incipient and natural conditions are still preserved. \n\nFortunately, most of the RS coast fits in this category. \n\nThe FEPAM decided that the GERCO/RS should address first the northern sector \n\nbecause it is the most developed coastal area (FEPAM, 2000). The GERCO/RS defined 14 \n\nEcologic and Economic Zones (ZEE) for the northern sector, presenting their characteristics, \n\nrestrictions of uses, and activities to be promoted (FEPAM, 2000). As an example, it has been \n\ndefined for the developed beaches that (a) foredunes should be preserved or restored, (b) a \n\nsetback line for coastal constructions should be set 60 m inland of the foredunes baseline, and (c) \n\nrecreation, tourism, and development should be promoted. There is no doubt that a management \n\nplan has to be established along intensely developed shorelines, the question here is whether the \n\npriority should be given to these areas. Considering that about 77% of this shoreline is \n\ndeveloped, from which half the length represents constructions built on top of the dunes (Table \n\n6.2), it seems to be less effective to establish control construction lines and dune preservation \n\nalong the northern sector than along the mainly undeveloped central and southern sectors. \n\nAdditionally, beaches along the northern sector are mainly accreting in the long and short terms \n\nwhile erosion is observed in areas where further (or new) development will mean an increase in \n\nthe number and length of critical management areas with time. Defining the ZEE and \n\nestablishing setback lines and restrictions of use along undeveloped areas under erosion or \n\necologically important areas appear to be the faster and most efficient way to reduce efforts of \n\n\n\n 118 \n\ncorrective management in the medium and long terms. Therefore, the importance of \n\nunderstanding shoreline changes in different time scales to help in the identification of the \n\npriority areas for coastal management. \n\nAbout a decade ago, Tagliani (1995) has drawn attention for the need to define strategies \n\nfor a planned development along the coastal sector on time to mitigate the environmental \n\nproblems associated with unregulated occupation and uses. The author includes the present \n\nbeach-dune system as conservation areas and lists the identification of erosion zones along the \n\ncoast and lagoon margins amongst the most important aspects that need to be addressed to \n\nimprove management in that sector. Thus, results presented in this study contribute towards a \n\nbetter understanding of some of the parameters that are important to define the best management \n\npractices for different sectors of the RS coast at a regional scale. The best management practices \n\nare defined also according to social, economic, and cultural issues that need to be evaluated at a \n\nlocal scale. Priority areas represent about one third of the RS coast and are concentrated in the \n\ncentral sector. The best alternative to these areas is to implement management policies to \n\npromote their natural characteristics. For example, the areas adjacent to the Lagoa do Peixe \n\nNational Park show a great potential for ecotourism, an expanding activity that attracts half \n\nmillion tourists and generates R$ 500 million and 30,000 direct jobs per year in Brazil (MMA, \n\nhttp://www.mma.gov.br/port/sds/ecotur/corpo.html). Regulating occupation and uses along the \n\ncentral sector is crucial to preserve its natural resources. Critical areas represent 29% of the RS \n\ncoast and include mainly developed beaches and their surroundings. The southernmost critical \n\narea comprises the beaches from Chu\u00ed to Hermenegildo, where development is not intense and is \n\nsurrounded by long undeveloped shorelines. Thus, management strategies there should differ \n\nfrom the ones applied to the highly urbanized shores of the northern sector. For example, \n\nrelocation or planned retreated should be evaluated as possible responses to the erosion problem \n\nin beaches such as Hermenegildo, where there is enough undeveloped area either alongshore or \n\ninland and beachfront properties are not worth an expensive protection measure. The same \n\nproblem in the area of Tramanda\u00ed and Cidreira should be addressed in a different way as there is \n\nno room for relocation and tourism and beachfront properties represent significant economic \n\nrevenue that needs to be protected.  \n\n \n\nCONCLUSIONS \n\nThis study points different classes of management for RS beaches based on the following \n\nfactors: (a) rates of population growth from 1991 to 2000, (b) intensity of beachfront \n\ndevelopment and the state of conservation of the beach system, (c) shoreline change rates \n\nestimated for the period 1997 to 2002, and (d) coastal evolution in the Holocene. The RS beaches \n\n\n\n 119 \n\nwere classified into four classes of management: (1) areas of critical management occur along \n\nabout 177 km or 29% of the RS coastal length, (2) priority areas are found along 198 km or 32% \n\nof the RS coastal length, (3) areas of future concern occur along 65 km or 10% of the coastal \n\nlength, and (4) natural areas along 178 km or 29% of the RS coastal length. \n\nBeaches along the northern coastal sector were classified as areas of critical management \n\nas they are highly developed (about 77% of the beachfront), show the highest rates of population \n\ngrowth (mean annual rate above 4%), and the beach-dune system is intensely altered. Beaches \n\nsouth of Xangril\u00e1 are eroding in the short term, demanding a management strategy different from \n\nthe one designed for the accreted beaches to the north. Most of the central sector (198 km or \n\n72%) is classified as priority areas, including the shores of Mostardas, Tavares, and the northern \n\ncoastline of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte. About 23 km or 8.4% of the length of the central sector were \n\nclassified as critical areas (Palmares do Sul), and 54 km or 19.6% of its length as natural areas \n\n(southernmost S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Norte). Palmares do Sul and Mostardas show high rates of population \n\ngrowth (mean annual rate above 2%), but the first one was classified into the critical \n\nmanagement class because it is located closer to the critical areas of the northern sector, is more \n\nintensely developed, and already shows problems due to unplanned occupation. The priority \n\nareas are mainly undeveloped with a preserved beach-dune system, show a potential of \n\nincreasing pressure in the near future (due to recently facilitated access), and are eroding in the \n\nlong or short term. Natural areas are pristine shores that are not threatened by population growth \n\nor accelerated development, and are mainly accreting. The southern coastal sector is dominated \n\nby natural areas (124 km or 56% of its length), although 65 km or 30% of its length are classified \n\nas areas of future concern (beaches from Hermenegildo to Albard\u00e3o), and 31 km (14%) are \n\nclassified as critical areas (from Chu\u00ed to Hermenegildo and Cassino).  \n\nIt is discussed in this study that priority areas should be addressed first in a longer term \n\nstate program of coastal management because preventive management is easier and less \n\nexpensive to implement, and is more efficient as it reduces the number and length of critical \n\nareas in the medium to long terms. Additionally, data related to short-term shoreline changes and \n\ncoastal evolution are presented and used to define classes of management. The identification of \n\neroding beaches in the long or short terms is especially important because these areas need to be \n\naddressed more urgently than accreting beaches to prevent development in risk zones. \n\nManagement measures applied for eroding areas need to include setback lines and restriction \n\nzones for development and uses. \n\n \n\n\n\n 120 \n\nLITERATURE CITED \n\nCalliari, L.J., &amp; Klein, A.H.F. 1993.

Com base em levantamentos de campo realizados em 2000 (Cap\u00edtulo \n\n2), a extens\u00e3o do litoral do RS foi descrita como sendo de aproximadamente 630 km nos \n\ncap\u00edtulos 2, 3 e 4 desta tese. Considerando-se que em nenhuma das cinco situa\u00e7\u00f5es em que a \n\nlinha de costa foi mapeada por DGPS este comprimento foi registrado e que a FEPAM utiliza o \n\nvalor de 618 km, esta deve ser esta a extens\u00e3o correta do litoral ga\u00facho. De acordo com a \n\nFEPAM (http://www.fepam.rs.gov.br/programas/gerco.asp), a costa do RS pode ser dividida em \n\nquatro setores: (1) o litoral norte, estendendo-se de Torres, no limite com o estado de Santa \n\nCatarina, at\u00e9 Balne\u00e1rio Pinhal, (2) o litoral m\u00e9dio leste, seguindo de Palmares do Sul at\u00e9 S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 \n\ndo Norte, (3) o litoral m\u00e9dio oeste, consistindo nos munic\u00edpios ao longo da margem oeste da \n\nLagoa dos Patos, e o (4) litoral sul, que compreende os munic\u00edpios de Rio Grande e Santa Vit\u00f3ria \n\ndo Palmar.  Este estudo n\u00e3o abrange a costa lagunar, de forma que a costa oce\u00e2nica dos 16 \n\nmunic\u00edpios costeiros do RS \u00e9 aqui dividida em tr\u00eas setores seguindo-se a divis\u00e3o estabelecida \n\npela FEPAM: (1) o litoral norte, apresentando 123 km, (2) o litoral m\u00e9dio ou central, que se \n\nextende por 275 km, e (3) o litoral sul, com 220 km de extens\u00e3o. Apesar de outros limites terem \n\nsido utilizados nos cap\u00edtulos iniciais deste estudo, posteriormente passou-se a adotar esta divis\u00e3o \n\nque parece ser a mais adequada no momento. Os resultados apresentados nos artigos que comp\u00f5e \n\nesta tese possibilitam fazer uma descri\u00e7\u00e3o regional das condi\u00e7\u00f5es atuais em que se encontra a \n\ncosta do RS com base em par\u00e2metros como: a ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o urbana, crescimento populacional, n\u00edvel \n\nde altera\u00e7\u00e3o antr\u00f3pica das praias, variabilidade temporal e espacial das flutua\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de \n\ncosta de curto termo, e as tend\u00eancias de acres\u00e7\u00e3o, estabilidade ou eros\u00e3o no longo termo. A \n\nan\u00e1lise integrada desses par\u00e2metros permitiu ainda definir classes de manejo costeiro para \n\ndiferentes setores da costa, identificando \u00e1reas que necessitam ser atendidas mais urgentemente \n\npor medidas preventivas ou corretivas (\u00e1reas priorit\u00e1rias e cr\u00edticas, respectivamente). As \n\nprincipais conclus\u00f5es deste estudo s\u00e3o apresentadas a seguir. \n\nO uso do DGPS cinem\u00e1tico para monitorar posi\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa ao longo de toda a \n\nextens\u00e3o do litoral do RS possibilitou comparar a din\u00e2mica sazonal e interanual das flutua\u00e7\u00f5es da \n\nlinha de costa em diferentes trechos do litoral ga\u00facho, em escala e detalhamento in\u00e9ditos. Os \n\nresultados mostraram diferen\u00e7as regionais na magnitude dos deslocamentos, no padr\u00e3o sazonal \n\ndos deslocamentos e no intervalo de tempo em que a linha de costa retorna a sua configura\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nposi\u00e7\u00e3o antecedentes. No litoral sul, a linha de costa responde de maneira distinta ao sul e ao \n\nnorte do Albard\u00e3o, onde ocorre uma mudan\u00e7a significativa na orienta\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa. Ao \n\nnorte do Albard\u00e3o, os deslocamentos anuais da linha de costa mostram sempre acres\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nenquanto ao sul eles mostram acres\u00e7\u00e3o em um ano e eros\u00e3o no ano seguinte. No litoral m\u00e9dio, as \n\nflutua\u00e7\u00f5es anuais da linha de costa apresentam um padr\u00e3o ondulat\u00f3rio, no qual \u00e1reas em eros\u00e3o \n\nocorrem adjacentes a \u00e1reas em acres\u00e7\u00e3o e apresentam movimentos opostos em anos \n\n\n\n 125 \n\nconsecutivos. Os deslocamentos anuais no litoral norte tamb\u00e9m apresentam um comportamento \n\nondulat\u00f3rio e antag\u00f4nico semelhante ao do litoral m\u00e9dio. No entanto, no litoral norte, n\u00e3o h\u00e1 \n\naltern\u00e2ncia entre \u00e1reas em eros\u00e3o e acres\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo da costa, de forma que acres\u00e7\u00e3o praial \n\ndomina em um ano e eros\u00e3o domina no ano seguinte.  \n\nUm dos resultados mais intrigantes deste estudo refere-se ao retorno da linha de costa a \n\numa posi\u00e7\u00e3o anterior, formando uma imagem especular nos gr\u00e1ficos de deslocamento da linha de \n\ncosta. Este processo foi verificado em um intervalo de sete meses entre Albard\u00e3o e Cassino no \n\nlitoral sul e dezenove meses no litoral norte, nos outros setores n\u00e3o foi observada uma imagem \n\nespecular, embora a linha de costa tenha se deslocado para dire\u00e7\u00f5es opostas. Este processo j\u00e1 foi \n\nobservado na costa leste dos EUA comparando-se deslocamentos da linha de costa num per\u00edodo \n\nde duas semanas, antes e depois de uma tempestade (List &amp; Farris, 1999). Como esta imagem \n\nespecular foi observada para praias distintas em diversas escalas de tempo, provavelmente o \n\nretorno da linha de costa a sua forma e posi\u00e7\u00e3o anteriores \u00e9 uma quest\u00e3o de tempo. De forma que \n\nsomente monitoramentos sistem\u00e1ticos realizados por um longo per\u00edodo poder\u00e3o mostrar se esta \n\nforma e posi\u00e7\u00e3o anteriores s\u00e3o dominantes no tempo ou apenas momentos transit\u00f3rios entre \n\nestados altamente din\u00e2micos. \n\nOs resultados apresentados aqui corroboram com estudos anteriores que mostram as \n\nvaria\u00e7\u00f5es sazonais no perfil praial, que tende a erodir nos meses de outono e inverno, decorrente \n\nda maior energia de ondas e maior freq\u00fc\u00eancia das tempestades, e a engordar durante os meses de \n\nprimavera e ver\u00e3o. O comportamento antag\u00f4nico dos deslocamentos anuais da linha de costa \n\ncoincide com os eventos de El Ni\u00f1o e La Ni\u00f1a que ocorreram em 1997-1998 e 1999, \n\nrespectivamente. Os efeitos do El Ni\u00f1o na din\u00e2mica costeira provavelmente foram os \n\nrespons\u00e1veis pela retra\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa registrada em novembro de 1997. O per\u00edodo p\u00f3s-El \n\nNi\u00f1o caracterizado pela redu\u00e7\u00e3o na energia dos ventos e ondas possibilitou a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\npraia, resultando na acres\u00e7\u00e3o observada entre novembro de 1997 e novembro de 1998. J\u00e1 o \n\naumento da ciclog\u00eanese durante o evento La Ni\u00f1a de 1999 resultou na retra\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa \n\nobservada entre novembro de 1998 e novembro de 1999. Esta variabilidade temporal dos \n\ndeslocamentos anuais no litoral m\u00e9dio e norte faz com que estimativas de taxas de varia\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nlinha de costa possam apresentar valores muito distintos e at\u00e9 opostos dependendo do intervalo \n\nde tempo analisado. Taxas estimadas com base na compara\u00e7\u00e3o de posi\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa \n\nobtidas em apenas duas datas s\u00e3o particularmente sens\u00edveis e devem ser consideradas apenas \n\nquando as condi\u00e7\u00f5es (oceanogr\u00e1ficas e meteorol\u00f3gicas) que os dados representam forem \n\nconhecidas. Esta grande variabilidade temporal e espacial nos deslocamentos da linha de costa \u00e9 \n\nrespons\u00e1vel pela diferen\u00e7a nos resultados obtidos por estudos que analisam mudan\u00e7as na \n\nmorfologia costeira em diferentes escalas de tempo. \n\n\n\n 126 \n\nA variabilidade espacial na resposta da linha de costa \u00e0s mudan\u00e7as sazonais e interanuais \n\ndeve-se a uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de fatores de modo que \u00e9 dif\u00edcil determinar qual \u00e9 o mais importante. \n\nAs maiores varia\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa ocorrem em embaiamentos e est\u00e3o associadas a tamanhos \n\nde gr\u00e3o menores. Leves mudan\u00e7as na orienta\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa coincidem com varia\u00e7\u00f5es na \n\ngranulometria dos sedimentos praiais e com o padr\u00e3o ondulat\u00f3rio dos deslocamentos anuais da \n\nlinha de costa, que tamb\u00e9m est\u00e3o relacionados com os gradientes no transporte sedimentar \n\nlongitudinal mostrados pelos modelos. Os maiores volumes de transporte foram observados ao \n\nlongo das praias mais expostas \u00e0s ondas de SSW (geralmente associadas \u00e0 passagem de frentes \n\nfrias), que s\u00e3o \u00e1reas dominadas por eros\u00e3o (i.e. ao sul do Albard\u00e3o e entre o Estreito e o farol da \n\nConcei\u00e7\u00e3o). A altern\u00e2ncia entre \u00e1reas de eros\u00e3o e acres\u00e7\u00e3o no litoral m\u00e9dio pode ser causada por \n\nondas que se aproximam da costa em \u00e2ngulos maiores do que o de m\u00e1ximo transporte de \n\nsedimento conforme descrito por Ashton et al. (2003) e Murray &amp; Ashton (2003). Os resultados \n\nreferentes ao transporte de sedimento s\u00e3o baseados em modelos matem\u00e1ticos e s\u00f3 poder\u00e3o ser \n\nvalidados quando medi\u00e7\u00f5es de ondas e correntes ao longo da costa do Rio Grande do Sul \n\nestiverem dispon\u00edveis. A falta de dados de ondas, correntes e transporte sedimentar \u00e9 um fator \n\nlimitante para a verifica\u00e7\u00e3o e quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o das rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre as mudan\u00e7as nas condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nenerg\u00e9ticas ao longo da costa e ao longo do tempo e as respostas da linha de costa.  \n\nApenas 123 km ou aproximadamente 20% da costa do RS encontram-se urbanizados, \n\nconcentrados principalmente no litoral norte, onde a ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o desordenada, o uso intensivo e o \n\ncrescimento populacional acelerado resultaram em um sistema praial dominantemente alterado. \n\nMesmo nas \u00e1reas menos urbanizadas (litoral central e sul), a ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o urbana \u00e9 sempre \n\ncaracterizada pela falta de planejamento, ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1reas de risco, destrui\u00e7\u00e3o ou altera\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\n\u00e1reas protegidas por lei, e/ou interfer\u00eancia nos processos din\u00e2micos naturais. Caracter\u00edsticas que \n\nparecem ser t\u00edpicas da ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o costeira no Brasil (Moraes, 1995). Como resultado, quase um \n\nter\u00e7o (32%) do litoral ga\u00facho apresenta-se alterado por atividades antr\u00f3picas. O aumento \n\nacelerado da popula\u00e7\u00e3o costeira n\u00e3o s\u00f3 agrava os problemas existentes como tende a extend\u00ea-los \n\nsobre \u00e1reas adjacentes. Embora o RS apresente uma densidade populacional na costa menor do \n\nque a m\u00e9dia do estado, sete dos dez munic\u00edpios de maior crescimento populacional entre 1991 e \n\n2000 localizam-se no litoral norte. O aumento da demanda por espa\u00e7o e o crescimento \n\npopulacional j\u00e1 s\u00e3o observados tamb\u00e9m em Palmares do Sul e Mostardas, munic\u00edpios do litoral \n\nm\u00e9dio. Estes dois munic\u00edpios localizam-se mais pr\u00f3ximos das \u00e1reas mais populosas do estado e \n\nrecentemente tiveram acesso facilitado atrav\u00e9s do asfaltamento da BR101.   \n\nConsiderando-se apenas as vari\u00e1veis relacionadas ao crescimento populacional, \n\nocupa\u00e7\u00e3o urbana e impactos antr\u00f3picos, o litoral norte e as praias urbanizadas de Palmares do Sul \n\nj\u00e1 s\u00e3o classificados como \u00e1reas de manejo cr\u00edtico, que requerem medidas corretivas. As \u00e1reas \n\nurbanizadas do litoral sul (praia do Cassino, Hermenegildo e Chu\u00ed) tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o enquadradas \n\n\n\n 127 \n\nnessa mesma categoria. J\u00e1 os trechos da costa de Palmares do Sul e Mostardas que atualmente \n\ns\u00e3o pouco ocupados, mas que apresentam uma tend\u00eancia recente de intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o de seu uso \n\n(taxas de crescimento populacional acima da m\u00e9dia do estado e acesso facilitado), s\u00e3o \n\nclassificados como \u00e1reas priorit\u00e1rias de gerenciamento costeiro, que necessitam urgentemente de \n\nmedidas que regulamentem a ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o e usos. As demais \u00e1reas da costa do RS apresentam \n\npouca ou nenhuma press\u00e3o de ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o urbana e n\u00e3o h\u00e1 ind\u00edcios de que este cen\u00e1rio seja \n\nmodificado nos pr\u00f3ximos anos, sendo ent\u00e3o classificadas como \u00e1reas em que a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nplanos de manejo s\u00e3o menos urgentes. O gerenciamento costeiro integrado visa o \n\ndesenvolvimento sustent\u00e1vel atrav\u00e9s da harmoniza\u00e7\u00e3o entre as atividades antr\u00f3picas e o ambiente \n\nf\u00edsico. Estabelecer tend\u00eancias e quantificar a magnitude das flutua\u00e7\u00f5es da linha de costa, tanto \n\nem eventos extremos quanto em taxas m\u00e9dias ao longo do tempo, \u00e9 essencial para definir classes \n\nde manejo em \u00e1reas pouco ocupadas e estabelecer as estrat\u00e9gias mais adequadas em \u00e1reas \n\nurbanizadas. Sendo assim, enquanto a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o costeira de longo termo (centenas a milhares de \n\nanos) define tend\u00eancias de acres\u00e7\u00e3o ou eros\u00e3o, as varia\u00e7\u00f5es de curto termo (sazonais e \n\ninteranuais) s\u00e3o fundamentais para identificar \u00e1reas de risco em escalas de tempo compat\u00edveis \n\ncom planos de manejo. As varia\u00e7\u00f5es extremas na posi\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa s\u00e3o particularmente \n\nimportantes em costas sujeitas \u00e0 alta energia de onda, onde tempestades intensas e eventos como \n\nEl Ni\u00f1o geram retra\u00e7\u00e3o costeira e destrui\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas, conforme demonstrado por Allan et \n\nal. (2003) para a costa do Oregon, nos EUA. Os autores mostram que, enquanto determinado \n\nsetor da costa pode estar est\u00e1vel ou em acre\u00e7\u00e3o em uma escala de centenas de anos, o impacto de \n\neventos de alta energia pode resultar em per\u00edodos de eros\u00e3o acelerada que pode perdurar por \n\nmeses ou anos, culminando na destrui\u00e7\u00e3o de constru\u00e7\u00f5es costeiras. Portanto, linhas de recuo para \n\nconstru\u00e7\u00f5es costeiras devem ser baseadas nessas flutua\u00e7\u00f5es de curto termo, pois s\u00e3o elas que \n\namea\u00e7am a integridade de estruturas, colocam a popula\u00e7\u00e3o em risco e trazem preju\u00edzos \n\necon\u00f4micos \u00e0s comunidades costeiras. \n\n No Rio Grande do Sul, por exemplo, durante o Holoceno, barreiras progradantes \n\ndominam a costa entre Torres e Tramanda\u00ed e barreiras est\u00e1veis dominam entre Tramanda\u00ed e \n\nMostardas. No entanto, eros\u00e3o tem sido dominante nas praias ao sul de Xangril\u00e1 at\u00e9 Mostardas, \n\nno curto e m\u00e9dio prazos. Nessas \u00e1reas, a variabilidade na posi\u00e7\u00e3o da linha de costa em escalas de \n\nanos a d\u00e9cadas aumenta os riscos de inunda\u00e7\u00e3o e destrui\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas, impondo que sejam \n\ndefinidas estrat\u00e9gias de manejo para \u00e1reas em eros\u00e3o, como linhas de recuo para constru\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\nrestri\u00e7\u00e3o de usos e reloca\u00e7\u00e3o de estruturas ou atividades amea\u00e7adas, mesmo que a costa esteja \n\nprogradando no longo termo. J\u00e1 entre Mostardas e Estreito, a retra\u00e7\u00e3o costeira dominou durante o \n\nHoloceno enquanto, no curto termo, as grandes magnitudes e a variabilidade temporal e espacial \n\ndos deslocamentos da linha de costa fazem com que eros\u00e3o ou acres\u00e7\u00e3o sejam registradas \n\ndependendo do per\u00edodo de tempo analisado. Essas praias s\u00e3o muito suscet\u00edveis \u00e0s flutua\u00e7\u00f5es da \n\n\n\n 128 \n\nlinha de costa o que as torna inadequadas para ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o urbana. Desta forma, mesmo que essas \n\n\u00e1reas atualmente se encontrem desocupadas e sem demanda de uso, s\u00e3o consideradas priorit\u00e1rias \n\npara o gerenciamento costeiro. O trecho de costa n\u00e3o urbanizado entre o Chu\u00ed e o Hermenegildo, \n\napresenta tend\u00eancia \u00e0 eros\u00e3o no longo e curto termo e proximidade com \u00e1reas cr\u00edticas, de forma \n\nque tamb\u00e9m \u00e9 inclu\u00eddo nesta categoria. As praias entre o Hermenegildo e o Albard\u00e3o atualmente \n\nn\u00e3o apresentam nenhuma press\u00e3o de uso ou ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o, mas por apresentarem tend\u00eancia \u00e0 eros\u00e3o \n\nem diferentes escalas de tempo, s\u00e3o classificadas como \u00e1reas latentes. \n\nAl\u00e9m das caracter\u00edsticas antr\u00f3picas e da din\u00e2mica costeira, a presen\u00e7a de ecossistemas \n\necologicamente sens\u00edveis ou protegidos pela legisla\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental, tamb\u00e9m deve ser considerada \n\nnos planos de manejo. A proximidade dessas \u00e1reas \u00e9 um atrativo para o ecoturismo que \u00e9 um dos \n\nsetores de maior crescimento da ind\u00fastria do turismo e que, no Brasil, gera R$ 500 milh\u00f5es e 30 \n\nmil empregos diretos por ano (http://www.mma.gov.br/port/sds/ecotur/corpo.htm). Embora o \n\necoturismo tenha na conserva\u00e7\u00e3o do ambiente natural o seu fundamento, tamb\u00e9m pode gerar a \n\nsua degrada\u00e7\u00e3o se a intensifica\u00e7\u00e3o do uso n\u00e3o for controlada. A presen\u00e7a de atrativos naturais \n\naliada \u00e0 facilidade de acesso e \u00e0 falta de regulamenta\u00e7\u00e3o geralmente resulta na sobre-explora\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ne degrada\u00e7\u00e3o ambiental (Page, 1998). Esta deve ser mais uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o ao longo do litoral \n\ncentral onde se localiza o Parque Nacional da Lagoa do Peixe. Considerando todos os fatores \n\ndiscutidos acima, este estudo classifica a costa do Rio Grande do Sul em quatro classes de \n\nmanejo distribu\u00eddas da seguinte forma: (1) \u00e1reas de manejo cr\u00edtico, ocorrem em 177 km ou 29% \n\nda costa do RS e consistem basicamente nas \u00e1reas urbanizadas, concentradas principalmente no \n\nlitoral norte, (2) \u00e1reas priorit\u00e1rias, ocorrem em 198 km ao longo do litoral m\u00e9dio, ocupando \n\n32% da costa do RS, (3) \u00e1reas latentes ocorrem em 65 km ou 10% da costa, localizados no \n\nlitoral sul entre o Hermenegildo e o Albard\u00e3o e (4) \u00e1reas naturais, ao longo de 178 km ou 29% \n\nda costa ga\u00facha, encontradas no litoral central e sul. \n\n\n\n 129 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCAP\u00cdTULO 8 \n\n REFER\u00caNCIAS BIBLIOGR\u00c1FICAS \n\n\n\n 130 \n\nAllan, J.C.; Komar, P.D. &amp; Priest, G.R. 2003.
