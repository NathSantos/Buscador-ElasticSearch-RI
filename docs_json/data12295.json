Deste modo, os resultados promissores \n\ndesta nova abordagem t\u00eam vindo a refor\u00e7ar a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o relacionada com o RNA, avaliando \n\ne compreendendo os mecanismos celulares em que est\u00e1 envolvido, com o objetivo de o usar \n\ncomo uma nova classe de produtos bioterap\u00eauticos, de f\u00e1cil transla\u00e7\u00e3o e implementa\u00e7\u00e3o para \n\no \u00e2mbito cl\u00ednico. Na verdade, o mecanismo celular respons\u00e1vel pelo silenciamento da \n\nexpress\u00e3o g\u00e9nica apresenta um enorme potencial terap\u00eautico que poder\u00e1 alterar os \n\ntratamentos atualmente dispon\u00edveis para diversas patologias, como por exemplo as doen\u00e7as \n\nneurol\u00f3gicas.  \n\nOs microRNAs (miRNAs) constituem uma classe de RNAs de baixo peso molecular e, nos \n\n\u00faltimos anos, t\u00eam sido cada vez mais reconhecidos como mol\u00e9culas end\u00f3genas reguladoras \n\nem numerosos processos biol\u00f3gicos. Devido \u00e0 sua especificidade e efici\u00eancia, os miRNAs \n\ntornaram-se uma das ferramentas mais utilizadas no silenciamento de genes pelo mecanismo \n\nde RNA de interfer\u00eancia, uma vez que podem bloquear a s\u00edntese de prote\u00ednas atrav\u00e9s da \n\nindu\u00e7\u00e3o da degrada\u00e7\u00e3o do RNA mensageiro. Assim, os miRNAs podem ser considerados agentes \n\nterap\u00eauticos promissores. \n\nDurante a \u00faltima d\u00e9cada, a hip\u00f3tese de que os miRNAs podem ser usados como biof\u00e1rmacos \n\npara regular e controlar v\u00e1rias vias envolvidas no desenvolvimento e progress\u00e3o da doen\u00e7a de \n\nAlzheimer (DA) ganhou consist\u00eancia, uma vez que estes apresentam um papel crucial em \n\nmuitas fun\u00e7\u00f5es neuronais, tais como diferencia\u00e7\u00e3o, plasticidade sin\u00e1ptica, forma\u00e7\u00e3o da \n\nmem\u00f3ria, e normalmente est\u00e3o sub-expressos em doentes com esta patologia. A doen\u00e7a de \n\nAlzheimer \u00e9 a forma mais comum de dem\u00eancia e caracteriza-se por uma perda neuronal e \n\nsin\u00e1ptica generalizada, que causa um decl\u00ednio progressivo e irrevers\u00edvel em diversas fun\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ncognitivas. Embora, as causas ainda n\u00e3o sejam completamente compreendidas, sabe-se que \n\nesta doen\u00e7a neurodegenerativa est\u00e1 associada ao aparecimento de dois tipos de agregados \n\nproteicos, nomeadamente placas extracelulares beta-amiloides (A?) e complexos \n\nneurofibrilares intraneuronais. \n\nA forma\u00e7\u00e3o das placas de A? resulta da clivagem sequencial da prote\u00edna percursora amiloide \n\n(APP) pela BACE1 e, posteriormente, pelo complexo gama-secretase dando origem \u00e0s esp\u00e9cies \n\nA? t\u00f3xicas. Alguns estudos t\u00eam descrito uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o causal entre a express\u00e3o do miR-29 e a \n\nDA, uma vez que a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o dos n\u00edveis de express\u00e3o da fam\u00edlia miR-29 tem sido associada \n\nao aumento da express\u00e3o da BACE1 e, consequentemente da forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos p\u00e9ptidos A? em \n\ndoentes com DA. Desta forma, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o do miR-29 pode proporcionar uma estrat\u00e9gia \n\nterap\u00eautica eficaz na preven\u00e7\u00e3o, controlo da progress\u00e3o e tratamento desta patologia.  \n\n\n\n \n\n xiv \n\nAs terap\u00eauticas baseadas no uso de miRNAs recorrem, na sua maioria, \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de miRNAs \n\nsint\u00e9ticos. Embora a s\u00edntese de miRNAs possa ser muito eficiente, verifica-se normalmente a \n\npresen\u00e7a de contaminantes nas amostras de RNA sintetizado o pode levar \u00e0 inespecificidade \n\ndo silenciamento g\u00e9nico. Al\u00e9m disso, por norma, no processo de prepara\u00e7\u00e3o do RNA sint\u00e9tico \n\n\u00e9 necess\u00e1rio recorrer \u00e0 utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de solventes t\u00f3xicos, solventes org\u00e2nicos e condi\u00e7\u00f5es \n\ndesnaturantes, que podem comprometer a qualidade e integridade do produto alvo. Por todos \n\nestes motivos, e considerando o objetivo de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o terap\u00eautica destes novos produtos \n\nbiofarmac\u00eauticos, torna-se evidente a necessidade de desenvolver novos processos eficientes \n\nou melhorar as metodologias atualmente empregues para a sua prepara\u00e7\u00e3o. Assim, um dos \n\ndesafios mais importantes no desenvolvimento destas estrat\u00e9gias terap\u00eauticas surge com a \n\nnecessidade de produzir miRNA com elevado grau de pureza e atividade biol\u00f3gica, de modo a \n\nsatisfazer os requisitos necess\u00e1rios \u00e0 sua aplica\u00e7\u00e3o. Deste modo, uma das estrat\u00e9gias que \n\npode ser aplicada consiste na produ\u00e7\u00e3o recombinante de biomol\u00e9culas utilizando hospedeiros \n\nprocari\u00f3ticos. \n\nDesta forma, o objetivo principal do presente trabalho consiste no desenvolvimento e \n\nimplementa\u00e7\u00e3o de uma plataforma biotecnol\u00f3gica para a produ\u00e7\u00e3o e purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nprecursores de miRNAs, em particular o pre-miR-29b (percursor do miR-29), cuja aplica\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nvisa o silenciamento seletivo de vias end\u00f3genas diretamente relacionados com DA, \n\nnomeadamente a BACE1 e os p\u00e9ptidos A?. Paralelamente, ser\u00e3o desenvolvidas e \n\ncaracterizadas nanopart\u00edculas polim\u00e9ricas para a entrega do pre-miR-29b no citoplasma de \n\nc\u00e9lulas neuronais de forma seletiva e eficaz, de modo a assegurar o sucesso destas \n\nadministra\u00e7\u00f5es.  \n\nO sistema de express\u00e3o recombinante utilizado permitir\u00e1, pela primeira vez, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o e o \n\nisolamento do pre-miR-29b humano na bact\u00e9ria Rhodovulum sulfidophilum (R. sulfidophilum) \n\nDSM 1374, mantendo a sua atividade biol\u00f3gica. A utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o deste hospedeiro bacteriano \u00e9 \n\ninovadora e vantajosa, devido \u00e0 sua capacidade invulgar de secretar os \u00e1cidos nucleicos para \n\no meio de cultura, bem como devido \u00e0 aus\u00eancia de ribonucleases no mesmo, permitindo a \n\nobten\u00e7\u00e3o do miRNA de interesse com baixo conte\u00fado de impurezas bacterianas. A fim de \n\notimizar a produ\u00e7\u00e3o e acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de miRNAs no espa\u00e7o extracelular, as condi\u00e7\u00f5es de \n\ncrescimento foram estudadas, nomeadamente no que diz respeito ao efeito da temperatura e \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de cloreto de s\u00f3dio. Os ensaios realizados demonstraram ser poss\u00edvel \n\ndesenvolver um protocolo para o crescimento aer\u00f3bio da bact\u00e9ria R. sulfidophilum, na \n\naus\u00eancia de luz, a 30\u00baC, o que resulta num melhoramento do crescimento das c\u00e9lulas, seguido \n\nde um aumento da produ\u00e7\u00e3o do pre-miR-29b humano. Neste trabalho foi poss\u00edvel atingir uma \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o de pre-miR-29b no meio extracelular de aproximadamente 182 \u00b5g/L, ap\u00f3s 40 \n\nhoras de crescimento bacteriano e uma concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de 358 \u00b5g/L de pre-miR-29b \n\nintracelular, ap\u00f3s 32 horas de fermenta\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\n\n\n \n\n xv \n\nPara que seja poss\u00edvel a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o terap\u00eautica do pre-miR-29b \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio ter em conta as \n\nexig\u00eancias estabelecidas pelas ag\u00eancias reguladoras internacionais, que requerem a produ\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nde miRNA com elevada qualidade e atividade biol\u00f3gica. Para assegurar esta condi\u00e7\u00e3o, foram \n\ndesenvolvidas novas estrat\u00e9gias de purifica\u00e7\u00e3o para o pre-miR-29b, baseadas em \n\ncromatografia de afinidade. A fim de alcan\u00e7ar a m\u00e1xima seletividade e especificidade na \n\nsepara\u00e7\u00e3o do pre-miRNA de outras biomol\u00e9culas do hospedeiro (outras esp\u00e9cies de RNA e \n\nprote\u00ednas), foram desenvolvidos suportes de afinidade baseados nas intera\u00e7\u00f5es biol\u00f3gicas que \n\ns\u00e3o estabelecidas a n\u00edvel celular, usando como ligandos de afinidade, amino\u00e1cidos b\u00e1sicos \n\ncomo a L-lisina e a L-arginina. Na estrat\u00e9gia de purifica\u00e7\u00e3o com o amino\u00e1cido de L-lisina foi \n\ndemonstrada pela primeira vez a purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de pre-miRNA utilizando um gradiente \n\ndecrescente de concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de sulfato de am\u00f3nio em tr\u00eas passos, o que permitiu explorar \n\nmaioritariamente intera\u00e7\u00f5es hidrof\u00f3bicas. Contudo, a necessidade de aplicar elevadas \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00f5es de sal pode ser visto como uma desvantagem devido aos custos e ao impacto \n\nambiental associado ao processo, principalmente no que diz respeito \u00e0 aplica\u00e7\u00e3o ao n\u00edvel \n\nindustrial. De modo a ultrapassar estas limita\u00e7\u00f5es foi usada L-arginina como amino\u00e1cido \n\nimobilizado. Este estudo demonstrou a possibilidade de purificar o pre-miR-29b utilizando \n\ntr\u00eas estrat\u00e9gias diferentes de elui\u00e7\u00e3o, nomeadamente concentra\u00e7\u00f5es decrescentes de sulfato \n\nde am\u00f3nio e duas condi\u00e7\u00f5es de elui\u00e7\u00e3o moderadas, tais como usando um gradiente crescente \n\nde cloreto de s\u00f3dio e a adi\u00e7\u00e3o de um agente de competi\u00e7\u00e3o (arginina) ao tamp\u00e3o de elui\u00e7\u00e3o. \n\nA versatilidade da matriz de arginina na purifica\u00e7\u00e3o do pre-miR-29b sugeriu que o mecanismo \n\nde intera\u00e7\u00e3o envolveria uma multiplicidade de intera\u00e7\u00f5es n\u00e3o-covalentes, que globalmente \n\nresultam no bioreconhecimento do RNA de interesse. O reconhecimento bioespec\u00edfico e \n\nseletivo do pre-miR-29b por estes suportes cromatogr\u00e1ficos permitiu a sua purifica\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o de forma eficiente, com elevados rendimentos, grau de pureza e integridade, a \n\npartir de uma mistura complexa. Al\u00e9m disso, a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o da cromatografia de afinidade com \n\narginina resultou na elimina\u00e7\u00e3o das impurezas associadas \u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o recombinante, \n\nnomeadamente prote\u00ednas e endotoxinas, respeitando os crit\u00e9rios estabelecidos pelas ag\u00eancias \n\nreguladoras (por exemplo \u201cFood and Drug Administration\u201d \u2013 FDA). Considerando que esta \n\nestrat\u00e9gia cromatogr\u00e1fica requer condi\u00e7\u00f5es suaves de elui\u00e7\u00e3o, torna-se um m\u00e9todo de \n\npurifica\u00e7\u00e3o mais econ\u00f3mico do que a lisina-agarose. \n\nEm paralelo, a liga\u00e7\u00e3o do pre-miR-29b aos amino\u00e1cidos em estudo foi avaliada por biosensor. \n\nEste estudo tamb\u00e9m permitiu compreender as intera\u00e7\u00f5es envolvidas entre o pre-miR-29b e as \n\nmatrizes de lisina- e arginina-agarose, assim como determinar as melhores condi\u00e7\u00f5es que \n\nfavorecem o bioreconhecimento e a especificidade de liga\u00e7\u00e3o dos amino\u00e1cidos ao pre-miR-\n\n29b, preservando a sua estabilidade e integridade. Os resultados obtidos neste estudo \n\nmostraram a exist\u00eancia de v\u00e1rias intera\u00e7\u00f5es entre o pre-miR-29b e as matrizes de afinidade \n\ncom os amino\u00e1cidos imobilizados, tais como intera\u00e7\u00f5es hidrof\u00f3bicas, eletrost\u00e1ticas, cati\u00e3o-?, \n\npontes de hidrog\u00e9nio e for\u00e7as de \u201cvan der Waals\u201d.  \n\n\n\n \n\n xvi \n\nTendo em conta que a estrutura dos suportes cromatogr\u00e1ficos est\u00e1 em cont\u00ednuo \n\ndesenvolvimento de modo a proporcionar separa\u00e7\u00f5es r\u00e1pidas e eficientes, nomeadamente \n\npara a purifica\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1cidos nucleicos, foi tamb\u00e9m testado um suporte monol\u00edtico na \n\npurifica\u00e7\u00e3o do pre-miR-29b. Esta estrat\u00e9gia que associa a alta capacidade destes suportes \n\ncom a especificidade e seletividade conferida pelo ligando de agmatina (um derivado da L-\n\narginina), permitiu a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o do pre-miR-29b com alta efici\u00eancia (95%) e com elevado \n\ngrau de pureza (90%) para posterior aplica\u00e7\u00e3o nos ensaios in vitro. Al\u00e9m disso, este suporte \n\nmonol\u00edtico revelou elevada capacidade de liga\u00e7\u00e3o para o RNA, permitindo uma r\u00e1pida e \n\neficiente separa\u00e7\u00e3o do pre-miR-29b, independentemente da taxa de fluxo aplicada. No geral, \n\nfoi poss\u00edvel desenvolver m\u00e9todos de purifica\u00e7\u00e3o simples, robustos, vers\u00e1teis e de elevada \n\nreprodutibilidade, que permitiram minimizar o manuseamento das amostras e evitar o uso de \n\ncondi\u00e7\u00f5es desnaturantes e solventes org\u00e2nicos, contribuindo para o sucesso das aplica\u00e7\u00f5es \n\nterap\u00eauticas do RNA. \n\nNo entanto, o sucesso das terap\u00eauticas baseadas em miRNAs depende tamb\u00e9m da capacidade \n\nde entrega do miRNA, de forma seletiva e eficiente, aos \u00f3rg\u00e3os-alvo, com a m\u00ednima \n\ntoxicidade. De facto, a entrega cerebral de f\u00e1rmacos \u00e9 limitada por diversos fatores \n\nintr\u00ednsecos, nomeadamente a sua r\u00e1pida degrada\u00e7\u00e3o quando em contato com os fluidos \n\ncorporais e a reduzida permeabilidade ao longo da barreira hematoencef\u00e1lica (BHE). Para \n\nultrapassar estas limita\u00e7\u00f5es, v\u00e1rios sistemas de entrega de f\u00e1rmacos n\u00e3o-virais t\u00eam sido \n\ndesenvolvidos e caracterizados, nomeadamente os sistemas polim\u00e9ricos (poliplexos) que \n\npossuem caracter\u00edsticas intr\u00ednsecas ideais para a transfec\u00e7\u00e3o, prote\u00e7\u00e3o e liberta\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ncontrolada e direcionada de RNA. No presente trabalho, as formula\u00e7\u00f5es foram preparadas \n\ncom pol\u00edmeros comerciais, tais como quitosano e polietilenimina e demonstraram elevada \n\ncapacidade de transporte de RNA, apresentando pequenas dimens\u00f5es e uma forte carga \n\nsuperficial positiva. Al\u00e9m disso, e considerando o campo de aplica\u00e7\u00e3o do presente trabalho, \n\nestes sistemas devem tamb\u00e9m ter a capacidade de penetrar a BHE, levando a um aumento da \n\nconcentra\u00e7\u00e3o do pre-miRNA no c\u00e9rebro e, consequentemente uma melhoria da sua a\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nterap\u00eautica. Deste modo, a fim de potenciar o efeito terap\u00eautico das abordagens baseadas no \n\nRNAi no sistema nervoso central, os poliplexos desenvolvidos foram funcionalizados com \n\nligandos espec\u00edficos, tais como a lactoferrina e o \u00e1cido este\u00e1rico, os quais s\u00e3o reconhecidos \n\npelos recetores localizados \u00e0 superf\u00edcie da BHE. Este estudo revelou que os sistemas de \n\nentrega desenvolvidos conseguem penetrar a BHE e assim entregar o pre-miR-29b no c\u00e9rebro. \n\nFinalmente, avaliou-se a atividade biol\u00f3gica do pre-miR-29b recombinante atrav\u00e9s da \n\nverifica\u00e7\u00e3o da sua efici\u00eancia na regula\u00e7\u00e3o dos n\u00edveis de express\u00e3o dos genes relacionados com \n\na DA, em particular no silenciamento da BACE1 humana, utilizando modelos in vitro (linhas de \n\nc\u00e9lulas neuronais). O efeito da administra\u00e7\u00e3o do pre-miR-29b recombinante foi verificado \n\ntanto ao n\u00edvel da express\u00e3o do RNA mensageiro como ao n\u00edvel da express\u00e3o da prote\u00edna \n\nBACE1, atrav\u00e9s de RT-qPCR, Western blot e Imunocitoqu\u00edmica. Os resultados sugerem que o \n\n\n\n \n\n xvii \n\npre-miR-29b recombinante pode funcionar como biof\u00e1rmaco para a modula\u00e7\u00e3o terap\u00eautica \n\ndos n\u00edveis de BACE1, uma vez que foram atingidos elevados n\u00edveis de inibi\u00e7\u00e3o, ou seja 80% de \n\nredu\u00e7\u00e3o para a express\u00e3o da prote\u00edna BACE1 e 45% para os n\u00edveis dos p\u00e9ptidos beta amiloides, \n\nquando comparados com as c\u00e9lulas n\u00e3o transfectadas e c\u00e9lulas transfectadas como um RNA \n\nn\u00e3o relacionado bem como um miR-29b sint\u00e9tico.  \n\nEm suma, a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o destas metodologias ter\u00e1 um grande impacto na ind\u00fastria \n\nfarmac\u00eautica e biotecnol\u00f3gica, fornecendo a base para a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de novas formas \n\nterap\u00eauticas baseadas na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de miRNAs, n\u00e3o apenas para aplica\u00e7\u00e3o em doen\u00e7as \n\nneurol\u00f3gicas, mas tamb\u00e9m para futuros alvos terap\u00eauticos que possam ser de interesse.  \n\n \n\n \n\nPalavras-chave \n\n \n\nDoen\u00e7a de Alzheimer; Cromatografia de Afinidade; Direcionamento ao c\u00e9rebro; Silenciamento \n\nG\u00e9nico; Pre-miR-29b humano; Produ\u00e7\u00e3o Recombinante; Efici\u00eancia de Transfec\u00e7\u00e3o; Poliplexos  \n\n\n\n \n\n xviii \n\n\n\n \n\n xix \n\nAbstract \n\n \n\nThe possibility of selectively alter the expression pattern of a particular gene has been sought \n\nby scientists and clinicians for a long time. Nowadays, RNA interference (RNAi)-based \n\ntechnology has become a novel tool for silencing gene expression in cells. In addition, this \n\nstrategy encloses an enormous therapeutic potential that could change the course of the \n\ncurrently applied treatments in several life threatening pathologies and it is expected that \n\nthis technology can be translated onto clinical applications in a near future. MicroRNA \n\n(miRNA) has become a commonly employed tool for gene silencing, since it prevents protein \n\nsynthesis by inducing the messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation, with a high specificity degree. \n\nConsequently, in the last years, the miRNAs have emerged as biopharmaceuticals to regulate \n\nseveral pathways involved in the insurgence and progression of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), \n\nsince they might have key regulatory roles in many neuronal functions, such as \n\ndifferentiation, synaptic plasticity and memory formation, and typically they are down-\n\nregulated in disease conditions. In the literature there are some studies describing a causal \n\nrelationship between miR-29 expression and AD, since a loss of miR-29 cluster can contribute \n\nto increased beta-amyloid precursor protein-converting enzyme 1 (BACE1) and Amyloid-? (A?) \n\nlevels in sporadic AD patients. Thus, this evidence supports the possibility to use miR-29 as a \n\npotential therapeutic target for AD therapy. \n\nIn general, miRNA-based therapy relies on the use of synthetic microRNAs. However, these \n\nsynthesized formulations typically present contaminants that can lead to non-targeted gene \n\nsilencing, which still restricts the pre-clinical or clinical application of these RNAs. Thus, \n\nconsidering this therapeutic purpose and the global distribution of novel biopharmaceuticals \n\nit is necessary to develop efficient processes for their preparation. The development of new \n\nstrategies for microRNA production with high purity degree and biologically active is \n\nextremely required. One of the strategies might be the use of the recombinant production of \n\nbiomolecules using prokaryotic hosts.  \n\nHence, the present work intends to develop and establish an integrative biotechnological \n\nplatform to biosynthesize and purify a recombinant miRNA precursor (pre-miR-29b) to act in \n\nthe selective silencing of endogenous pathways directly related with AD, in particular BACE1 \n\nand A?. In addition, the success of these therapies also depends upon the ability to \n\nselectively and efficiently deliver the pre-miR-29b in the cytoplasmic compartment of \n\nneuronal cells, the location where their function is exerted; therefore the development of \n\nmiRNA delivery systems was also envisioned. \n\nThe expression system Rhodovulum sulfidophilum (R. sulfidophilum) DSM 1374 allowed, for \n\nthe first time, the production of human pre-miR-29b with a straightforward recuperation of \n\n\n\n \n\n xx \n\npre-miR-29b in a single step, maintaining its biological active form. The application of this \n\nrecombinant bacterial microorganism is innovative and is supported by the unusual capacity \n\nof secreting the nucleic acids to the extracellular space and the absence of host ribonucleases \n\nin the culture medium. Therefore, it is expected that the secreted miRNA will be devoid of \n\nmain bacterial associated impurities. Regarding the growth conditions, and conversely to \n\nwhat was previously described for this bacterium, our results showed to be possible to \n\ndevelop an original approach for the aerobic growth of the R. sulfidophilum, which results in \n\na cell growth improvement followed by an enhanced production of human pre-miR-29b. The \n\nextracellular pre-miR-29b concentration was approximately 182 \u00b5g/L, after 40 hours of \n\nbacterial growth and the total intracellular pre-miR-29b was of about 358 ?g/L, at 32 hours of \n\ncell growth. \n\nTo further develop a potential therapeutic application, the major interest is not only to \n\nproduce high quantities of RNA but also to obtain and preserve its biological active form, \n\nfulfilling the requirements of regulatory agencies. Hence, to assure that this prerequisite is \n\nmet it was used a novel and effective purification strategy, based on affinity \n\nchromatography, to purify the pre-miR-29b. Therefore, in order to achieve the selectivity \n\ntowards the target pre-miRNA and the maximum resolution between the pre-miR-29b and \n\nother host biomolecules (transfer RNAs and proteins) it was used an affinity support that \n\nexploits the same biological interactions that are established within the cell, by using \n\nimmobilized amino acids (L-lysine and L-arginine), as specific ligands. The recognition of the \n\npre-miR-29b achieved with these supports, allowed its selective recovery from a complex \n\nmixture with high efficiency and high purity. In parallel, the binding of pre-miRNA to these \n\ndifferent amino acids was studied by Surface Plasmon Resonance. This information brings \n\nimportant insights concerning the characterization of the pre-miRNA binding onto \n\nchromatographic supports. Moreover, it was possible to determine some particular conditions \n\nenabling the improvement of the binding specificity of the amino acid ligands used to purify \n\nmiRNA, preserving the RNA integrity. Taking into account that the structure of the \n\nchromatographic supports has been continuously developed to afford rapid and efficient \n\nseparations, namely for the purification of nucleic acids, it was also tested a monolithic \n\nsupport to purify the pre-miR-29b. The association of the high capacity of these supports with \n\nthe specificity conferred by the agmatine ligand (a derivative of L-arginine) represented a \n\nnovelty and an advantage to obtain highly pure pre-miR-29b (90%) with a high recovery yield \n\n(95%).   \n\nThe establishment of an effective application of miRNAs is usually constrained by different \n\nphenomena, namely their easy degradation when in contact with the body fluids. To \n\novercome this limitation, delivery systems, such as polymeric systems (polyplexes), were \n\ndeveloped and characterized in order to encapsulate and protect the pre-miR-29b \n\nbiopharmaceuticals from degradation, allowing their sustained and targeted release. The \n\nformulations prepared with chitosan and polyethylenimine demonstrated high loading \n\n\n\n \n\n xxi \n\ncapacity, small sizes and exhibited a strong positive charge on their surface. In addition, \n\nconsidering the application field of this work, the delivery systems should also have the \n\nability to penetrate the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), causing an increase of the pre-miRNAs \n\nconcentration in the brain and, consequently the improvement of the therapeutic effect. \n\nActually, BBB is an intrinsic barrier limiting miRNA therapeutic effect on the central nervous \n\nsystem. Thus, to improve the delivery of pre-miRNA therapeutics in the brain, the polyplexes \n\nwere functionalized with specific ligands, namely lactoferrin and stearic acid which are \n\nrecognized by cell surface receptors of BBB.  \n\nFinally, it was evaluated the biological activity of the recombinant pre-miR-29b by measuring \n\nthe efficiency on human BACE1 knockdown, using in vitro neuronal cell lines. The effect of \n\nrecombinant pre-miR-29b administration was verified by both assessing the mRNA and protein \n\nhuman BACE1 levels, by using RT-qPCR, Western blot and Imunocytochemistry. Results \n\nsuggest that recombinant pre-miR-29b can represent a novel biopharmaceutical product for \n\nthe therapeutic modulation of human BACE1 levels, because high levels of inhibition were \n\nachieved, namely 80% of reduction for BACE1 protein expression and 45% for A?42 levels. \n\nGlobally, the implementation of these cutting-edge technologies can have a great impact on \n\nthe biopharmaceutical industry, providing the basis for the implementation of novel miRNA-\n\nbased therapeutics, not only for neurological disorders but also for future therapeutic targets \n\nthat can be of potential interest.  \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\n \n\nAffinity Chromatography; Alzheimer\u2019s disease; Brain-targeting; Gene silencing; Human pre-\n\nmiR-29b; Recombinant Production; Transfection Efficiency; Polyplexes \n\n\n\n \n\n xxii \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n xxiii \n\nThesis Overview \n\n \n\nThis thesis is structured in four main chapters.

Alzheimer\u2019s disease and microRNAs \n\n \n\n1.1. Introduction  \n\nThe discovery of RNA interference (RNAi) by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello in the late 1990s, \n\nallowed them to win the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2006, and revolutionized the \n\ncontemporary understanding of gene regulation (Fire et al., 1998). Exogenous double-\n\nstranded RNA (dsRNA) was identified in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) as \n\nan effector molecule of the RNAi pathway, since this RNA silenced the expression of a \n\nhomologous target gene by directing degradation of its messenger RNA (mRNA). Moreover, the \n\nstudy demonstrated that the gene silencing was achieved with the administration of only few \n\nmolecules of dsRNAs and that these molecules were more efficient than the corresponding \n\nantisense RNA (Fire et al., 1998). Since then, several studies have demonstrated that RNAi is \n\na well-conserved, endogenous mechanism in several species, including mammals and plants \n\n(Chu and Rana, 2007; Lehman, 2010). In mammalian cells, the inhibitory capability of RNA \n\nwas initially demonstrated by the introduction of shorter dsRNAs, named small interfering \n\nRNAs (siRNAs), with perfect sequence complementarity to target mRNA transcripts, which had \n\nalready been discovered in plants (Chu and Rana, 2007; Dykxhoorn and Lieberman, 2006; \n\nFilipowicz et al., 2005; Zamore et al., 2000). \n\nAccordingly, the discovery that genes could be silenced by RNAs allowed the biological \n\nunderstanding of other roles of RNA, which changed from a simple intermediate molecule in \n\nthe information flux between DNA and proteins to a dynamic and versatile molecule, \n\nfundamental in the regulation of genes expression, involved in essential cellular processes of \n\nall living systems (Burnett and Rossi, 2012; Ramachandran and Ignacimuthu, 2013). \n\nCurrently, RNAi regulates the expression and function of individual genes, involved in \n\npathways or known to be associated with diseases (harmful or unwanted genes). This \n\nregulation occurs at the post-transcriptional level through non-coding RNAs molecules \n\n(ncRNAs), via sequence-specific degradation or blocking the translation of their target mRNA \n\nin most eukaryotic species (Bumcrot et al., 2006; Burnett and Rossi, 2012; Deng et al., 2014; \n\nRamachandran and Ignacimuthu, 2013). RNAi-based technology possesses attractive \n\ncharacteristics to be considered for therapeutic proposes, such as high specificity, efficiency, \n\nability to induce a robust and potent knockdown of the targeted genes and the possibility to \n\npromote a long-lasting therapy (the therapeutic effect lasts from days up to weeks), reducing \n\nthe expenses of medical treatments (Bumcrot et al., 2006; Burnett and Rossi, 2012; Deng et \n\nal., 2014; Milhavet et al., 2003). On the other hand, usually, the dosage required of ncRNA \n\ntherapeutics is low, which can reduce or eliminate the occurrence of undesirable adverse \n\n\n\n \n\n 4 \n\neffects in the patients (Guzman-Villanueva et al., 2012). These breakthroughs clearly \n\nencouraged a variety of studies on the mechanisms of gene expression regulation, which led \n\nto the emergence of numerous and different types of RNA-based therapeutics that extends \n\nthe range of targets of the existing pharmacological drugs (Burnett and Rossi, 2012). \n\nNcRNAs are a class of transcripts which, as the name implies, are not translated into proteins. \n\nPresently, ncRNAs are recognized as key regulatory molecules in a variety of cellular \n\nprocesses as diverse as development, cell viability, cell cycle regulation, stem cell self-\n\nrenewal, transposon activity control, differentiation, heterochromatin formation and \n\nmaintenance of cell integrity by gene silencing pathways, through translational repression or \n\nmRNA degradation (Kim, 2005; Svoboda, 2014). A very simplistic classification based on \n\nncRNAs length arbitrarily separates these biomolecules into two groups according to their \n\nsizes: the small (<200 nucleotides (nt)) and the long (>200 nt) ncRNAs (Dogini et al., 2014; \n\nGomes et al., 2013). In turn, the small group comprises infrastructural RNAs and regulatory \n\nRNAs. The infrastructural RNAs include ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), small \n\nnuclear RNA (snRNA) and small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) that are involved in the spliceosomal \n\nand translational machinery. On the other hand, regulatory RNAs include microRNAs \n\n(miRNAs), siRNAs delivered as synthetic duplexes to the cells, short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and \n\nPiwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), among others (Chu and Rana, 2007; Dogini et al., 2014; \n\nGomes et al., 2013; Matera et al., 2007). These differ significantly in their biogenesis and \n\nmode of action (Kim, 2005; Kim et al., 2009).  \n\nPresently, RNAi-based therapies have major implications for basic and biomedical research \n\nthat can lead to a number of clinical applications, for treating the vast number of human \n\ndiseases caused by one or few genes, such as viral infections, metabolic diseases, \n\ncardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke, immune dysfunction and autoimmune \n\ndisorders, distinct types of cancers and neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases (Gomes et \n\nal., 2013; Ramachandran and Ignacimuthu, 2013; Sullenger and Gilboa, 2002).  \n\n \n\n1.2. Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n\nNeurodegenerative diseases (NDs) are a family of disorders of central nervous system (CNS) \n\ncharacterized by a progressive loss of neuronal structure and function, resulting in a motor \n\nand cognitive dysfunction (Goodall et al., 2013; Maciotta et al., 2013). For that reason, these \n\ndisorders do not have cure, once the neurons cannot regenerate on their own after cell death \n\nor damage. Some of the most studied NDs include Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Parkinson\u2019s \n\ndisease, Huntington\u2019s disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Prion diseases (Junn and \n\nMouradian, 2012; Tabares-Seisdedos et al., 2011).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 5 \n\nNDs constitute a serious and growing health problem for our societies because they \n\ncollectively represent one of the leading causes of disability and mortality. Currently, it is \n\nestimated that NDs affect over 30 million people worldwide and that by 2030, this number \n\ncan reach 66 million people and increase to 115 million by 2050 (Schonrock et al., 2012). As a \n\nresult, these diseases are associated to higher health care costs, as well as, being a source of \n\nsevere human suffering (Dunkel et al., 2012). The increased prevalence of these diseases is \n\nintimately related with the current trends: the aging of the population due to increased life \n\nexpectancy which cause more people living long enough to be affected and the continuing \n\nlack of progress in identifying effective diagnosis and treatment modalities. All these reasons \n\nemphasize the necessity to study novel therapeutic interventions for these incurable diseases \n\n(Bertram et al., 2010; Qiu et al., 2009). \n\nAmong all dementing disorders, AD is the most prevalent (45-60%) and devastating form of \n\ndementia in the elderly and leads to death within 3 to 9 years after appearance of symptoms \n\n(Isik, 2010). According to the National Institute on Aging (www.nia.nih.gov/alzheimers), the \n\nAD is clinically characterized by loss of memory and eventually by disturbances in reasoning \n\n(e.g. trouble handling money), planning and performing activities of daily living, language, \n\nand perception (e.g. loss of orientation to time and place), as well as, changes of mood, \n\nbehavior and personality. Common behavioral symptoms of Alzheimer\u2019s include sleeplessness, \n\nagitation, anxiety, and depression (Buchman et al., 2013; Sperling et al., 2011; Wilson et al., \n\n2013).  \n\nIn 2014, it was estimated that more than 5.4 million individuals in the USA have AD and that \n\nthis number can nearly triplicate, from 5 million to as many as 16 million by 2050, thus \n\nsignificantly increasing social and economical burdens in industrialized countries, where the \n\naging population is increasing every year (Provost, 2010b; Suehs et al., 2013). AD is commonly \n\nclassified into two types: Sporadic Alzheimer\u2019s disease (SAD) or Familial Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n\n(FAD) (Blennow et al., 2006; Piaceri et al., 2013). SAD reports most AD cases (99%), occurs \n\nlate in life (65 years), and it can take up to 20 years for the disease to develop. Until now, \n\nSAD was only associated with a genetic mutation in the ?4 allele of the apolipoprotein E \n\n(APOE) gene, which promotes amyloid-beta (A?) deposition and impairs A? clearance \n\n(Bertram et al., 2010; Bu, 2009; Genin et al., 2011; Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Piaceri et al., \n\n2013). Presently, sporadic type affects 11% of the population over the age 65 and older, 32% \n\nof those over the age 85 and, the vast majority, 82% of the population aged 75 or older. In \n\ncontrast, FAD typically develops before the age 65 (40-50 years), is a very rare condition (1%) \n\nand it is caused by autosomal, dominant mutations in three genes, namely in the amyloid \n\nprecursor protein (APP) and in the genes of presenilin (PSEN1 and PSEN2), which are linked to \n\nA? processing by ?-secretase complexes (Blennow et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2013; Citron, \n\n2010; Piaceri et al., 2013). Generally, individuals are diagnosed with FAD when more than \n\none member is affected in more than one generation (Piaceri et al., 2013). Hence, it is \n\nfundamental to found a solution to this problem as soon as possible. \n\n\n\n \n\n 6 \n\nAD involves various regions of the brain that control learning, language, thought and memory \n\nand results from progressive neuronal loss (death of neurons), arising from often unknown or \n\ninsufficiently characterized risk factors and causes. Thereby, AD is a highly complex disease \n\nthat involves hundreds of defective genes distributed across the human genome (genetic \n\nfactors), in close interaction with other factors such as age (atrophy of certain parts of the \n\nbrain, inflammation, production of free radicals and mitochondrial dysfunction), family \n\nhistory (heredity), lifestyle factors (education, diet, smoking, substance abuse) and \n\nenvironmental risk factors (chemical exposure) contributing to its development and \n\nprogression (Bertram et al., 2010; Maes et al., 2009).  \n\nNeuropathological hallmarks of AD include extracellular senile plaques (known as amyloid \n\nplaques) formed of aggregates of toxic A? peptides and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles \n\n(NFTs) composed by insoluble hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule-associated protein \n\n(Blennow et al., 2006; Goedert et al., 1989; Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Mullane and Williams, \n\n2013). Although the mechanisms of AD remain unclear, it has been hypothesized that it can \n\nbe associated with abnormal protein metabolism, particularly in the formation and \n\naccumulation of the A? peptides (Mullane and Williams, 2013; Provost, 2010a; Schonrock et \n\nal., 2012). \n\nAmyloid peptide is composed by 40 or 42 amino acids and is generated upon sequential \n\nproteolytic cleavage of APP, a transmembrane protein expressed in many tissues and involved \n\nin the synaptogenesis, axonal transport, transmembrane signal transduction, cell adhesion \n\nand calcium metabolism (Chen et al., 2013; Glenner, 1989a; Glenner, 1989b). The initial step \n\nin the \u201camyloidogenic pathway\u201d is catalyzed by ?-secretase (also known as ?-site APP-\n\ncleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)), producing a carboxyl-terminal fragment of 99 amino acids \n\n(CTF99) and simultaneously the ectodomain of APP is released as soluble APP? (sAPP?) (see \n\nFigure 1) (Kim et al., 2014; De Strooper, 2010). Posteriorly, the resulting fragment of APP \n\n(CTF99) is cleaved by the ?-secretase complex (that is composed by at least four components, \n\nnamely PSEN1, Nicastrin (NCSTN), Presenilin enhancer 2 (PEN2) and Anterior Pharynx-\n\ndefective 1 (APH-1)), releasing into the cytoplasm an intracellular domain of APP of \n\napproximately 50 amino acids (AICD), and a variety of potentially amyloidogenic A? peptides \n\n(39-42 amino acids) (Figure 1) (Chen et al., 2013; Ghiso and Frangione, 2002; Kim et al., \n\n2014; Provost, 2010a). In alternative, in the \"non-amyloidogenic pathway\", APP is initially \n\ncleaved by the metalloprotease ?-secretase, releasing a soluble APP? ectodomain (sAPP?), \n\nand generating at the same time, a carboxyl-terminal fragment of 83 residues (CTF83), which \n\nis further processed by ?-secretase, liberating extracellular p3 and the AICD (Ghiso and \n\nFrangione, 2002).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 7 \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Amyloidogenic and Non-amyloidogenic pathways for proteolytic processing of APP \n\nby ?-secretase, BACE1, and ?-secretase. \n\nAbbreviation: APP, amyloid precursor protein; BACE1, ?-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1; CTF83/99, \n\ncarboxyl-terminal fragment of 83/99 amino acids; sAPP?/?, soluble APP?/?. \n\n \n\nWhile ?-secretase produces several A? peptides with heterogeneous carboxyl-terminus \n\nranging from 38-43 amino acids, BACE1 is a site-specific protease that cleaves exactly \n\nbetween specific amino-acids of APP. In addition, BACE1 catalyses the first and rate-limiting \n\nstep in the pathway (Provost, 2010a; Schonrock et al., 2012; Vassar et al., 2009). Consistent \n\nwith this hypothesis, several research groups have demonstrated that the levels and the \n\nactivity of BACE1 are elevated in sporadic AD brain, suggesting the possibility that BACE1 \n\noverexpression might initiate or accelerate AD. For these reasons, BACE1 has been recognized \n\nas a prime drug target for therapeutic inhibition of A? production in AD, once the BACE1 \n\ninhibition can decrease production of all forms of A? peptides (Vassar et al., 2009). Within \n\nthe variety of A? peptide isoforms produced in the CNS, A?1-40 is the most predominant form \n\ncontributing for more than 90% of the total A?, whereas A?1-42 is the most neurotoxic form and \n\nis considered to be primarily responsible for neuronal damage. As mentioned above, amyloid \n\nplaques are formed from the gradual accumulation and aggregation of secreted A? peptides in \n\noligomers and fibrils in the extracellular space. However, recent studies demonstrated that \n\nthe accumulation of A? occur also within neurons with AD pathogenesis (De Strooper, 2010; \n\nDong et al., 2012). \n\n\n\n \n\n 8 \n\nAlthough several molecular mechanisms have been implicated in the AD pathology, most \n\nevidences indicate that the intraneuronal A? accumulation and the amyloid plaques play a \n\npivotal role in the synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death and cognitive dysfunction (Figure 2), \n\nwhich cause neurodegeneration and dementia in a first instance and then leads to AD (Delay \n\net al., 2012; Feng and Feng, 2011; Iyengar et al., 2014; Maciotta et al., 2013; Tan et al., \n\n2013). Many processes are common features in neurodegeneration, namely cellular oxidative \n\nstress (overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of cell death \n\npathways), protein oligomerization and aggregation, deregulation of calcium homeostasis, \n\nmitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, DNA damage and aberrant RNA processing \n\n(Borgesius et al., 2011; Goodall et al., 2013; Jeppesen et al., 2011; Qiu et al., 2009). These \n\nevents initiate pro-apoptotic cascades that activate members of the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-\n\n2) family and lead to the rapid activation of caspases (Feng and Feng, 2011; Maciotta et al., \n\n2013; Van den Hove et al., 2014). In addition to plaques and tangles as histopathological \n\nhallmarks, other pathological changes include impaired axonal transport, neuron-glial \n\ninteractions and reduced synaptic plasticity (Delay et al., 2012). As shown in Figure 2, \n\nmechanisms that affect AD pathogenesis involve dysregulation of multiple fundamental \n\ncellular pathways, including protein folding and clearance processes. Concluding, in order to \n\ndevelop an AD therapeutic it is essential to understand the principal features of this disease. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Alzheimer's disease pathways. \n\nAbbreviations: A?, Amyloid-beta; APH-1, Anterior Pharynx-defective 1; APP, Amyloid Precursor Protein; \n\nAPOE, Apolipoprotein E; Cdk5, Cell division protein kinase 5; GSK3, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; MAPT, \n\nMicrotubule-Associated Protein Tau; NCSTN, Nicastrin; PEN2, Presenilin Enhancer 2; PSEN1, Presenilin 1; \n\nROS, Reactive Oxygen Species.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 9 \n\nMany other disorders can be confused with AD, once no specific blood test or imaging test \n\nexists for the diagnosis of AD. Thus, AD is currently being diagnosed using a combination of \n\nseveral methods and clinical tools to reach a correct diagnosis, which includes a thorough \n\ngeneral medical workup, a neurological exam based in mental status tests (such as tests of \n\nmemory, problem solving, attention and language) and psychiatric evaluation (to assess \n\nmood, anxiety and clarity of thought) (Jack et al., 2011). Furthermore, the diagnosis includes \n\nstructural imaging of the brain with computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, \n\nsingle-photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography (Albert et al., \n\n2011; Barthel et al., 2011; McKhann et al., 2011). Nonetheless, brain imaging is not a \n\nstandard part of the assessment for possible AD since although these methods are good \n\nbiomarkers, they are also quite expensive. The clinical diagnosis of AD remains difficult and, \n\nsometimes the definitive diagnostic is only established by post-mortem confirmation. \n\n \n\nIn the last few years, several studies have been made to identify the neuropathological, \n\nbiochemical, and genetic biomarkers of the AD so that the diagnosis could be done as early as \n\npossible, even in the absence of obvious symptoms, once AD patients are known to have \n\nneuropathology in their brains for over 10 to 20 years before any symptoms occur. A? \n\npeptides (A?40 and A?42, which are more prone to aggregation) and tau/phospho-tau (Thr 181, \n\na common phospho-epitope), in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), have been widely accepted as \n\nrobust biomarkers in AD diagnosis (Holtzman, 2011; Tarawneh and Holtzman, 2010). However, \n\nthe wide variability and inconsistency that exists among different studies and the invasive \n\nnature of the procedures required to obtain CSF have been delaying the use of more accurate \n\nand efficient biomarkers as a diagnostic tool for AD in the clinical setting (Holtzman, 2011; \n\nIngelson et al., 1999). Finally, the biomarkers also allow following the patient response to the \n\ntreatment, enabling to elaborate specific regimen changes if a drug is not providing the \n\ndesired benefit.  \n\n \n\nDespite the efforts to identify optimal treatment schemes containing one or more drugs, the \n\nmajority of the currently available options are still largely ineffective due to several reasons. \n\nIn particular, the molecular pathology of dementia is still poorly understood, the genetic and \n\nepigenetic component of dementia is poorly defined, and the understanding of genome-drug \n\ninteractions is very limited (Cacabelos and Torrellas, 2014). In addition, the drug targets are \n\ninappropriated and most treatments are symptomatic, for instance, although patients treated \n\nwith antipsychotic drugs experience moderate benefits in reducing aggression and psychosis, \n\nthey are accompanied of serious adverse effects, such as sedation, stroke, movement \n\ndifficulties (Parkinsonism), thus limiting their routinely use (Cacabelos and Torrellas, 2014). \n\nPresently, there are only four drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n\navailable to treat the cognitive problems of Alzheimer's: three are acetylcholinesterase \n\ninhibitors (Donepezil (Aricept\u00ae), Rivastigmine (Exelon\u00ae), Galantamine (Razadyne\u00ae) \n\ncommonly prescribed for mild-to-moderate AD) and the other one (Memantine (Namenda\u00ae)) \n\n\n\n \n\n 10 \n\nis an N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist prescribed for moderate-to-severe AD \n\n(Cacabelos and Torrellas, 2014). These drugs can help maintain thinking, memory, and \n\ncommunication skills and help with certain behavioral problems but they do not delay or \n\ninterrupt AD progression. The most common adverse effects are nausea, hallucinations, \n\nconfusion, dizziness, headache, fatigue and vomiting.  \n\n \n\nAlthough the precise mechanisms responsible for the pathology of AD are still unclear, several \n\nconvincing evidences suggest that the generation and accumulation of A? peptides, in the \n\nbrain, plays the central role in initiating and development of a complex neurodegenerative \n\ncascade, which results in progressive cognitive impairment and dementia (Glenner, 1989a). \n\nHence, the \"amyloid cascade\" is the most widely discussed and investigated pathway, to find \n\nthe cause of AD. So the regulation of protein expression levels involved in the A? generation \n\nprocess has demonstrated to be important in AD progression. Consequently, the current drug \n\ndiscovery approaches have focused on preventing the formation and aggregation of the A? or \n\nto facilitate their clearance. \n\n \n\nDuring the past 30 years, the understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of the \n\npathophysiology of this dementia has advanced dramatically; however, limited knowledge of \n\nthe basic pathogenic mechanisms is a major hurdle in the identification of drug targets and \n\ndevelopment of therapeutic strategies for this yet incurable disorder. All these reasons \n\nhighlight the need for the development of innovative and alternative therapeutic strategies to \n\nprevent, slow or stop the progression of this disease.  \n\n \n\nAt present, alternative therapeutic strategies focused on the specific gene expression control \n\n(mRNA and protein levels) can contribute to the regulation of several neuronal functions, \n\nsuch as differentiation, synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Cacabelos and Torrellas, \n\n2014). Gene therapy is a highly promising therapeutic method for the treatment or prevention \n\nof AD, using genetic information. In addition, gene therapy can be more economical and \n\nconvenient because it provides higher targeting and prolonged action. A possible regulatory \n\nmechanism of gene expression in AD is via ncRNAs, designed RNAi mechanism (Cacabelos and \n\nTorrellas, 2014). One important class of gene expression regulators is miRNAs. A number of \n\nstudies, in the last decade, focused on the hypothesis of using miRNAs as biopharmaceuticals \n\nto regulate several pathways involved in the insurgence and progression of AD. This idea has \n\ngained support, because some miRNAs are differentially expressed in the human brain \n\n(including the spinal cord, cerebellum, hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex) and regulate \n\nthe expression of genes associated with specific neurodegenerative disorders (Delay et al., \n\n2012; Feng and Feng, 2011; Maciotta et al., 2013; Satoh, 2012; Tan et al., 2013; Tan et al., \n\n2015). Thus, the use of these RNAs can provide an effective therapeutic strategy for AD \n\ntreatment and diagnosis. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 11 \n\n1.3. MicroRNAs as therapeutic products \n\nMiRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) were discovered approximately two decades ago by Ambros and \n\ncolleagues, when their studies revealed that a small non-coding RNA (sncRNA), lineage-4 (lin-\n\n4) regulated the larval development timing of the C. elegans (Lee et al., 1993; Wightman et \n\nal., 1993). This regulation is accomplished by inhibition of the expression of a protein-coding \n\ngene through recognition of complementarity sites in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of lin-\n\n14 mRNA (Lee et al., 1993). Accordingly, the discovery of miRNAs has been one of the most \n\nfascinating breakthroughs of recent times and, now, miRNAs represent the most extensively \n\nstudied class of evolutionarily conserved, endogenous, sncRNAs (Satoh, 2010). At present, \n\n1881 miRNAs have been identified in humans and its sequences are available in the official \n\nmiRNA database (miRBase, www.mirbase.org), a repository of miRNAs from many organisms.  \n\nMiRNAs have emerged as pivotal modulators that are directly involved in the regulation of \n\ngene expression at the post-transcriptional level via base-pairing interactions between the 5? \n\nend of the miRNA and the 3?UTR of their target mRNA, which results in mRNA translational \n\nrepression or degradation, depending on the degree of sequence complementarity (Bartel, \n\n2004; Filipowicz et al., 2005; Selbach et al., 2008).  \n\nMiRNAs are formed in a multistep biological process involving critical endonucleases. Figure 3 \n\nshows the miRNA biogenesis pathway. The great majority of miRNA genes are commonly \n\ntranscribed as a long primary transcript (usually 1\u20134 kilobases), known as primary-miRNAs (pri-\n\nmiRNAs) by RNA polymerase II (Bartel, 2004; Lee et al., 2004). The genomic location of \n\nmiRNAs genes varies and can be located in intra- and/or inter-genetic regions of the genome \n\nand at least 42% are estimated to be expressed in clusters. Like mRNAs, these pri-miRNAs are \n\ncapped at the 5? end and polyadenylated at the 3? end, forming double stranded stem-loop \n\nstructures, and can be transcribed as autonomous transcription units, or as clusters from a \n\npolycistronic transcription unit (Bartel, 2004; Gomes et al., 2013; Junn and Mouradian, 2012). \n\nIn the nucleus, these primary transcripts, containing the mature miRNA sequence, are \n\nrecognized by a microprocessor complex (composed by an enzyme ribonuclease III Drosha \n\nalong with its regulatory subunit, the double-stranded RNA-binding protein called DiGeorge \n\nsyndrome critical region gene 8 (DGCR8)) that cleaves the base of the stem-loop (~11 nt) (Han \n\net al., 2006). This step produces a long stem-loop precursor of miRNA, with a hairpin \n\nsecondary structure of approximately 70 to 100 nucleotides, named pre-miRNAs, with two \n\nnucleotides overhang at its 3? end. After nuclear processing by a series of enzymes, the pre-\n\nmiRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm by a nuclear transport receptor complex, Exportin-5 \n\nand its co-factor Ran (the GTP-bound form) that acts by recognizing a 2-3 base pair overhang \n\nof the pre-miRNA stem-loop structure (Lund et al., 2004). \n\nOnce in the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNAs are further processed and its terminal loop is removed \n\nby a complex that contains the cytoplasmic protein Dicer (a ribonuclease III) and its co-\n\n\n\n \n\n 12 \n\nfactors TRBP (Tar RNA-binding protein) and PACT (Protein kinase R-activating protein). As a \n\nconsequence, pre-miRNAs are converted into mature double-stranded miRNAs (miRNA-miRNA* \n\nduplexes) of variable length (~19\u201325 nt) (Nilsen, 2007). After Dicer cleavage, mature miRNAs \n\nare associated with Argonaute (Ago) proteins, in particular Ago1 and Ago2, which are core \n\ncomponents of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). During loading, mature miRNA is \n\nunwound in two strands: a single antisense miRNA strand (or guide strand, also referred to as \n\nmiRNA) and a sense strand (or passenger strand, also referred to as miRNA*) that is released \n\nand, subsequently degraded by Ago2-catalysed endonucleolytic cleavage (Figure 3) (Nilsen, \n\n2007). This selection might be determined by the relative thermodynamic stability of the two \n\nends of miRNA duplexes and thus, the strand less stable at the 5\u2019 end is loaded into RISC, \n\nalthough in some cases, both strands are incorporated into the RISC. \n\nAfter the selection of the antisense strand, this is loaded onto the RISC, to form miRNA \n\nsilencing complex (miRISC) that identifies target mRNA based on sequence complementarity \n\nwith the miRNA. In animals, the binding between the miRNA strand and their targets RNA \n\ntranscripts occurs mainly through specific sequences, called the \u201cseed sequence\u201d. The \u201cseed\u201d \n\nregion is composed by 2-8 nt located in 5\u2019 end of the miRNA (Bartel, 2009; Gomes et al., \n\n2013). A group of miRNAs that share the same \u201cseed sequence\u201d but differ outside are \n\nfrequently considered a \u2018family\u2019 of miRNAs and in most, but not all, cases might target the \n\nsame gene. It is noteworthy that some miRNAs do not have a \u201cseed sequence\u201d complete, \n\ninstead exhibit 11-12 continuous base pairs in the central region of the miRNA. \n\nMiRNAs usually bind with partial complementarity in the 3\u2019UTRs of its target mRNAs, resulting \n\nin the cleavage, de-adenylation or translation inhibition of target mRNAs. As mentioned \n\nabove, the regulation mechanism of the translation depends on the degree of \n\ncomplementarity between miRNA-target mRNA, resulting in direct cleavage and degradation \n\nof mRNA transcripts when there is perfect complementarity or inhibition of protein expression \n\nby blocking mRNA translation, in the case of imperfect base pairing (Bartel, 2004; Nilsen, \n\n2007; Selbach et al., 2008; Stark et al., 2005). \n\n\n\n \n\n 13 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Biogenesis of microRNAs. \n\nAbbreviations: 3/5?-UTR, 3/5? Untranslated Region; AAA, poly(A) tail; Ago, Argonaute; DGCR8, DiGeorge \n\nsyndrome Critical Region gene 8; GTP, Guanosine Triphosphate; miRISC, miRNA-Induced Silencing \n\nComplex; mRNA, messenger RNA; miRNA, microRNA; ORF, Open Reading Frame; PACT, Protein kinase R-\n\nActivating Protein; pre-miRNA, precursor miRNA; pri-miRNA, primary miRNA; TRBP, Tar RNA Binding \n\nProtein. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 14 \n\nThe target mRNA is enzymatically cleaved, leading to a decrease in the corresponding protein \n\nexpression. Regulatory subunits within the RISC complex and/or present in the mRNAs (i.e. \n\ncytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein complexes, mRNPs) play decisive roles in miRNA-mRNA \n\nlocalization, miRNA responsiveness to cellular signaling and mode of action. These complexes \n\ncan be directed to polyribosomes in sub-cellular compartments, where miRNA regulates \n\ntranslation, resulting, sometimes, in truncation of the protein (Nilsen, 2007). Alternatively, \n\nthe resulting translationally blocked mRNAs and miRNA complex can then be sequestered in \n\ncytoplasmic processing bodies (termed P-bodies), where untranslated mRNAs are stored and \n\neventually degraded through exonuclease enzymes (Figure 3). On the other hand, specific \n\nmiRNAs have been shown to destabilize targets by recruiting de-adenylating enzymes, poly(A) \n\nnucleases, to help modulate de-adenylation of mRNA and thereby prevent translation. \n\nTherefore, the regulation of gene expression mediated by miRNA is a complex science in \n\neukaryotes and is still an evolving concept, once several molecular mechanisms have been \n\nreported, including translational repression, increased mRNA de-adenylation and degradation \n\nof the target mRNAs (Bartel, 2004; Gomes et al., 2013; Nilsen, 2007). Although these \n\nmechanisms are quite different, the main mode of action of mature miRNA is based on the \n\nrecognition of specific sites (known as microRNA response elements (MRE)), typically present \n\nin the 3\u2019UTRs of their target mRNAs, leading to a decrease in the production of the proteins \n\nby cells. Despite, of this binding occurs typically in the 3\u2019UTR of mRNA, some miRNAs can \n\nbind specific sites in the 5\u2019UTRs of the mRNA with less frequency and efficiency compared to \n\n3\u2019UTR targeting (Stark et al., 2005).  \n\nOverall, the miRNAs can regulate a large proportion of the human transcriptome (up to 60% of \n\nall human protein-coding genes) by targeting multiple transcripts. An important feature of \n\nthese RNAs is that an individual miRNA can regulate up to a few hundred of different mRNA \n\ntargets and, consequently, can induce multiple effects on the expression of several related \n\ngene families, suppressing the expression of multiple and diverse proteins implicated in \n\nbiological processes (Selbach et al., 2008). On the other hand, multiple miRNAs can regulate \n\nthe expression of a single target mRNA, and most likely synergistically acting. Despite \n\nadvances in miRNA discovery, the role of miRNAs in pathophysiologic processes is still in early \n\nstages of research. The extensive research in the last decade has implicated miRNAs as \n\nmaster regulators of a variety of physiological and biological processes, including \n\ndevelopmental timing, cell cycle, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, cell \n\ndifferentiation, stress response, metabolism, stem cell self-renewal, organ development, \n\nhematopoiesis, embryogenesis and neurogenesis (Alvarez-Garcia and Miska, 2005; Bartel, \n\n2004; Bartel, 2009; Kloosterman and Plasterk, 2006). As a result of its efficacy and potential \n\nto inhibit the expression of a specific mRNA, coupled with its versatility in several cellular \n\nprocesses, miRNAs might be explored as new therapeutic agents in diseases that have genetic \n\norigins, as is the case of AD. In fact, it is expected that miRNAs-based therapeutics will be \n\none of the major classes of therapeutic molecules in the future (Delay et al., 2012; Dessy and \n\n\n\n \n\n 15 \n\nGorman, 2011; Kocerha et al., 2009; Kosik, 2006; Maes et al., 2009). Not surprisingly, miRNA-\n\ntargeting therapies are an area of intense interest to pharmaceutical companies, and many of \n\nsuch compounds are now being evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials for a variety of \n\nindications, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. \n\n \n\n1.4. miR-29 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease \n\nAs mentioned above, over the last years, a growing number of studies have been \n\nconcentrated in the identification of deregulated proteins and protein-encoding genes \n\ninvolved in the pathogenesis of AD, and, as a result, numerous genes have been identified as \n\ntargets for therapeutic approaches (see Table 1) (Cacabelos and Torrellas, 2014). Despite \n\ntheir relatively recent discovery, it is already clear that miRNAs might play important \n\nregulatory roles in the molecular control of neuronal development, synaptic plasticity (forms \n\nthe basis of learning and memory), neurotransmission, aging of the brain, and in a variety of \n\nphysiologically relevant processes in neurodegeneration (Fineberg et al., 2009; Grasso et al., \n\n2014; Klein et al., 2005; Kosik, 2006; Schratt et al., 2006). Consequently, in the past decade, \n\ntremendous efforts have been put mainly into identifying miRNAs that are changed in AD, \n\ndemonstrating that an abundant and particularly diverse source of miRNAs is present in the \n\nbrain and helping in the characterization of molecular pathways that are deregulated \n\nconcomitantly to the formation of Tau and amyloid aggregates (Delay et al., 2012; Feng and \n\nFeng, 2011; Maciotta et al., 2013; Maes et al., 2009; Satoh, 2012; Tan et al., 2013; Tan et \n\nal., 2015; Van den Hove et al., 2014). Nevertheless, it remains difficult to predict whether \n\nthese changes, like the abnormal expression profiles and dysfunction of brain-enriched \n\nmiRNAs linked to AD, are a cause or a consequence of the neurodegenerative process and \n\ndementia (Du and Pertsemlidis, 2011; Grasso et al., 2014; Kocerha et al., 2009; Nelson et al., \n\n2008; Ullah et al., 2014). \n\nThus, miRNAs have been intensively investigated as potential diagnostic and prognostic \n\nbiomarkers, solely or in combination with other AD biomarkers, or also as novel therapeutic \n\nagents for AD (Cogswell et al., 2008; Grasso et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2013). In Table 1 are \n\ndescribed some of the de-regulated miRNAs that have been recognized as being involved in \n\nthe pathological features of AD, as well as their target genes.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 16 \n\nTable 1 - Dysregulated microRNAs in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (adapted from (Cacabelos and Torrellas, 2014; Delay et al., 2012; Feng and Feng, 2011; \n\nMaciotta et al., 2013; Satoh, 2012; Tan et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2015; van den Hove et al., 2014)). \n\n \n\nmiRNAs Trend Status Validated targets \n\nmiR-15a, -16, -34 Up Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic factor) \n\nmiR-124 Down APP alternative splicing via PTPB1 \n\nmiR-9, -15a, -19b, -29a/b-1/c, -107, -124, -195,  \n\n-298, -328, -485-5p \nDown BACE1 \n\nLet-7, miR-15a, -16, -17-5p, -20a, -101, -106a/b,  \n\n-147, -153, -323, -520c, -644, -655 \nDown APP \n\nmiR-29a/b-1 Down NAV3 (Neuron navigator 3), Bim, Bmf, Hrk, Puma \n\nmiR-9, -181c Down TRIM2, BTBD3, TGFBI \n\nmiR-9, -34c, -128 Down/Up SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1, a de-acetylase that interacts with Tau) \n\nmiR-146a Up CFH (Complement factor H) and IRAK1 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase-1) \n\nmiR-9 Down \nREST (RE-1 silencing transcription factor), BAF53a, Tlx,  \n\nNF-H (Neurofilament H), A? \n\nmiR-9, -15, -29a/b-1, -137, -181c Down SPT (Serine palmitoyletransferase) \n\nmiR-9 Down PSEN1 \n\nmiR-34 Up Cdk4, cyclin D1, Tau \n\nmiR-128  ROS \n\nmiR-107 Down CDK6, CFL1, CDK5R1, HIF-1b \n\nmiR-132 Down FOXO3a, Tau via PTBP2 (Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2) \n\nmiR-9, -15a \n\nmiR-181c \nDown \n\nHyperphosphorylation of tau via ERK1(Extracellular signal regulated kinase 1) \n\nTau acetylation \n\n\n\n \n\n 17 \n\nInterestingly, several studies showed that there is a set of miRNAs (include miR-9, miR-15, \n\nmiR-29, miR-106, miR-107 and miR-124) that seems to be specifically altered in the AD brain \n\nand they have been associated to different molecular pathways in AD pathogenesis. In \n\nparticular, the regulation of these miRNAs was correlated with the modulation of the \n\nexpression and/or processing of AD-related genes, such as APP, BACE1, A? peptides \n\ndeposition, tau protein phosphorylation, SIRT1 and MAPT signaling pathway (which encodes \n\nfor tau) (see Table 1) (Delay et al., 2012). Indeed, this can represent a significant advance for \n\nAD diagnosis and treatment. \n\nThe miR-29 remains as one of the most interesting and intriguing miRNA families, once this \n\nmiRNA has a strong impact on many processes involved in the pathogenesis of the AD \n\n(Cogswell et al., 2008). The miR-29 family includes four members: miR-29a, miR-29b-1, miR-\n\n29b-2 and miR-29c, and all share identical sequences at nucleotide positions 2-8 of 5\u2019 end and \n\nthe same seed region (Kriegel et al., 2012; Liston et al., 2012).  \n\nAs mentioned above, the BACE1 protein levels are elevated in AD brains, suggesting that \n\nBACE1 dysregulation is directly implicated in AD pathogenesis through the formation of toxic \n\nA? peptides. Thus, it has been established that reducing BACE1 expression may delay or even \n\nreduce AD progression. On the other hand, significant alterations in the expression levels of \n\nmiR-29 family were found in brains of AD patients, being significantly decreased and \n\ndisplaying abnormally high levels of BACE1 protein (Hebert et al., 2008; Zong et al., 2011). It \n\nis tempting to speculate that miR-29 might play an important role in the adult brain. \n\nParticularly, the work of Hebert and co-workers, in 2008, showed that the decreased levels of \n\nthe miR-29a/b-1 cluster were correlated with increased levels of BACE1 expression in patients \n\nwith SAD (Figure 4) and that the introduction of synthetic miR-29 reduces secretion of A? \n\npeptides (Hebert et al., 2008).  \n\nIn addition to its potential role as a major element to silence BACE1 protein expression, it \n\nwas recently shown that miR-29b can also be used as an inhibitor of neuronal apoptosis. \n\nHowever, the miR-29b is decreased in the AD brain and therefore it loses its ability to inhibit \n\napoptosis. MiR-29b has been identified to target a family of pro-apoptotic regulators, \n\nincluding Bim, Bmf, Hrk and Puma (see Table 1) (Kole et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2006). \n\nThese findings raised the opportunity to use pre-miR-29 in the implementation of a possible \n\nprotective therapeutic strategy for AD and suggest that BACE1 can be a promising target in \n\nthe therapeutic of this disease. The use of pre-miRNA instead of the mature miRNA could \n\nrepresent an advantage to the therapeutic process, because, in cellular environment the pre-\n\nmiRNA is more easily recognized and processing within the cell is more efficient (Tsutsumi et \n\nal., 2011). Moreover, the pre-miR-29b structural characteristics, specifically the single chain \n\nwith approximately 80 nucleotides of which some are unpaired in the 3\u2019overhang, will \n\npossibly make easier its production and purification.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 18 \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Pre-miR-29b-1 regulation of BACE1 in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\n\n\n \n\n 19 \n\n1.5.

Introduction  \n\nNowadays, microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) represent the most extensively studied class of non-\n\ncoding RNAs due their great potential for therapeutic knockdown of disease-causing genes \n\n(Satoh, 2010; Soifer et al., 2007). On the other hand, several evidences indicate that some \n\nendogenous miRNAs circulate extracellularly steadily and stable in bodily fluids (such as blood \n\nserum, plasma, urine, saliva and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)) and therefore they have also been \n\nreported as promising biomarkers (Cogswell et al., 2008; Grasso et al., 2014; Sheinerman and \n\nUmansky, 2013).  \n\nThese RNAs are small, highly-conserved and act as endogenous modulators of gene expression \n\nat the post-transcriptional level (reviewed in (Bartel, 2004; Filipowicz et al., 2008; Guo et \n\nal., 2010; Selbach et al., 2008)). In a few words, miRNAs mediate the regulation of gene \n\nexpression through a sequential process involving a long primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) that is \n\ncleaved producing a hairpin secondary structure called precursor of miRNA (pre-miRNA). \n\nAfterwards, subjected to cytoplasmic processing by a series of enzymes, the pre-miRNA is \n\nconverted into a mature double-stranded miRNA and, subsequently, the mature miRNA is \n\nincorporated into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to regulate the messenger RNA \n\n(mRNA) (Bartel, 2004; Gomes et al., 2013; He and Hannon, 2004). The main mechanism of \n\naction of mature miRNA is the recognition of specific sites (\u201cseed sequence\u201d, 2-8 \n\nnucleotides), typically present in the 3\u2019untranslated region (3\u2019UTR) of their target mRNAs. \n\nThis recognition results in the degradation of mRNA transcripts, when there is perfect \n\ncomplementarity between the 5? end of the miRNA and selected target mRNA, or translational \n\nrepression of protein expression by blocking mRNA translation or inducing de-adenylation of \n\nmRNA, if imperfect base pairing prevails (Nilsen, 2007; Selbach et al., 2008; Stark et al., \n\n2005). The complexity of the regulation induced by miRNA is also the result of multiple \n\ninteractions established between miRNAs and their targets, once a single mRNA is targeted by \n\nmultiple miRNAs, while a single miRNA (or miRNA family) can have effects in the expression \n\nof several hundreds of target mRNAs and consequently, is able to regulate the production of \n\nmultiple and diverse proteins involved in a biological process (Selbach et al., 2008). \n\nAs result of the recent and extensive research, miRNAs have been implicated as master \n\nregulators of a variety of physiological and cellular processes, such as cell proliferation and \n\ndifferentiation, cell cycle regulation, cellular physiology, cell adhesion, apoptosis, stress \n\nresponse, regulation of signaling pathways and metabolism (Alvarez-Garcia and Miska, 2005; \n\nBartel, 2004, 2009; Kloosterman and Plasterk, 2006). Furthermore, since some miRNAs are \n\nexpressed in high abundance in the human brain, they are also involved in the regulation of \n\nneurobiological functions, namely neurogenesis, aging of the brain, neuronal and dendritic \n\nspine development, neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity and self-renewal of neural stem \n\ncells (Fineberg et al., 2009; Grasso et al., 2014; Klein et al., 2005; Kosik et al., 2006; Schratt \n\net al., 2006).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 32 \n\nAs demonstrated by a large number of studies in the last decade, dysregulation of expression \n\nlevels of miRNAs, as well as their dysfunction in the brain have been associated with the \n\npathogenesis of various diseases of the nervous system, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, \n\nParkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (Du and \n\nPertsemlidis, 2011; Grasso et al., 2014; Kocerha et al., 2009; Nelson et al., 2008; Ullah et al., \n\n2014). The neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) constitute a serious and growing health problem \n\nfor our societies, being one of the main causes of morbidity and healthcare costs to society. \n\nIn general, this family of disorders is characterized by a profound and progressive loss of \n\nneuronal structure and function in specific parts of the nervous system (such as, cognitive, \n\nmotor or sensory areas), culminating in a final common pathway of neuronal cell death, \n\narising from often unknown or insufficiently characterized risk factors and causes (Goodall et \n\nal., 2013; Maciotta et al., 2013). In fact, there are increasing evidences supporting that NDs \n\nare caused by genetic and/or epigenetic alterations to protein-coding genes (Morris et al., \n\n2010; Serretti et al., 2007). The implications of this knowledge for the understanding of the \n\ncontribution of miRNAs in NDs are the eventual generation of novel targets for therapeutic \n\nintervention, which are based on the specific genetic alterations which are directly involved \n\nin neurodegenerative pathogenesis, by inhibition of the activity of neurotoxic genes or by \n\nmolecular activation of neuroprotective pathways (Grasso et al., 2014; Junn and Mouradian, \n\n2012). Thus, the characteristics of miRNAs, as well as, their expression profiling in the NDs \n\nhas led the advance towards new diagnosis, staging, progression, prognosis/prevention, drug \n\ndevelopment and response to the treatments of these disorders (Kocerha et al., 2009). \n\nAccordingly, miRNAs have recently gained much attention for their roles in neurodegenerative \n\npathogenesis, supporting their potential as targets/drug candidates for the development of \n\nnovel therapies for application in specific NDs that currently remain very challenging and \n\ndifficult to overcome. However, the success of these emerging therapeutic strategies depends \n\non the miRNA integrity, the absence of contaminants and its biological activity. Therefore, it \n\nis highlighted the importance of the purification procedures in obtaining the final RNA \n\nproducts with quality and quantity compatible with the administration in humans  \n\nIn this review, it is briefly discussed the key aspects and research trends related to the use of \n\nmiRNAs in the treatment of NDs, followed by a detailed analysis of the methodologies for \n\ntheir production, isolation, recovery, purification and delivery. Thus, the focus it will be the \n\nstrategies presently used for miRNA therapy; it will be discussed their use and drawbacks, and \n\nthe challenges and future directions for development of miRNA-based therapy for NDs. \n\n \n\n2. MicroRNAs as therapeutic products \n\nTo understand the role of miRNAs in neurological processes, it is mandatory to develop tools \n\nto regulate their levels, once NDs may be caused by the loss- or gain-of-function of an \n\nindividual or family miRNA. The normal function of a miRNA can be efficiently and specifically \n\n\n\n \n\n 33 \n\nrestored (miRNA replacement therapy) by synthetic or in vitro transcribed mature double-\n\nstranded miRNA-like molecules called miRNA mimics (see Figure 1 and Table 1). An \n\nalternative approach is the over-expression of exogenous mature miRNAs encoded by plasmids \n\nthat are processed in eukaryotic cells, by transient or stable transfection or viral transduction \n\nof a pri-miRNA transgene, pre-miRNA and pre-miRNA-like short hairpins RNAs (shRNAs) (see \n\nFigure 1 and Table 1) (reviewed in (Bumcrot et al., 2006; Junn and Mouradian, 2012; Li and \n\nRana, 2014; Magen and Hornstein, 2014; McDermott et al., 2011; Soifer et al., 2007; van Rooij \n\nand Kauppinen, 2014)).  \n\nHowever, when the problem comes from the over-expression of a specific type of miRNA, the \n\ninhibition of these miRNAs (miRNA inhibition therapy) can be accomplished through injection \n\nof complementary RNA sequence that binds to the miRNA, inactivating and blocking its \n\nactivity. Thus, the inhibition of miRNA activity can be achieved by the use of small miRNA \n\ninhibitors, oligomers, including RNA and DNA analogues, such as various modified anti-sense \n\noligoribonucleotides (anti-sense \u201canti-miRs\u201d), antagomirs, locked nucleic acid (LNA)-anti-\n\nmiRNAs, \u201cmiRNA sponges\u201d and \u201cmiRNA-masks\u201d, which are currently being evaluated in \n\npreclinical and clinical studies (see Table 1 and Figure 1) (reviewed in (Bumcrot et al., 2006; \n\nJunn and Mouradian, 2012; Li and Rana, 2014; Magen and Hornstein, 2014; McDermott et al., \n\n2011; Soifer et al., 2007; van Rooij and Kauppinen, 2014)).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Schematic representation of microRNA-based therapeutic approaches. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 34 \n\nmiRNA reinstatement Advantages Limitations \n\n \n\nmiRNA mimics \n\n \n\n-Small, synthetic and chemically modified \ndouble-stranded miRNA that are processed \ninto single-strand form inside the cells \n \n\n-They can be loaded into RISC to achieve the \ndownstream inhibition of the target mRNAs \n\n \n\n \n\n-Mimics the function of endogenous mature or precursor \nmiRNA molecules by direct re-introduction in the cells or \ntissues \n \n\n-Increases the levels of a miRNA that is lost during \ndisease progression  \n\n \n\n \n\n-Usually conjugated or encapsulated with different in vivo \ndelivery system, in order to influence the stability and \nuptake \n \n\n-Systemic delivery can result in uptake by non-target tissues \nthat normally do not express the miRNA of interest, resulting \nin potential off-target effects \n \n\n-Mimics can potentially induce a non-specific interferon \nresponse through Toll-like receptors \n\n \n\nmiRNA \nexpression \n\nvectors \n\n \n\n-Plasmid or viral expression vectors \nconstructed with strong promoters that \nenable the expression of various species of \nmiRNAs in specific tissues \n\n \n\n-Restoration of the expression and function of a specific \nmiRNA \n \n\n-Viral delivery of miRNAs can be optimized to achieve a \nspecific and continuous  expression level \n \n\n-Evidences of transduction efficiency and minimal \ntoxicity \n\n \n\n-The vector-based miRNA expression systems are generally \nless efficient because it is necessary to transcribe the DNA to \nmiRNA precursors by the action of RNA polymerases, which \nimplies the delivery to the nucleus \n \n\n-Over-expression of shRNA in rats caused hepatotoxicity, \norgan failure and death \n \n\n-Argonaute proteins and the pre-miRNA export protein \n(exportin-5) limit the amount of exogenous miRNA that a cell \ncan tolerate \n\nmiRNA inhibiting drugs  Advantages Limitations \n\n \n\nAntisense \noligonucleotides \n(AMOs), known \n\nas anti-miRs \n\n \n-Synthetic, single-stranded antisense RNA \nmolecules designed to be complementary to \nthe target miRNA \n \n-Competitive inhibition between mature \nmiRNAs and their mRNA targets by Watson-\nCrick binding  \n \n \n\n \n-The targeted inhibition of a specific miRNA and \nsubsequent upregulation of target mRNAs can be \nachieved, as they function by binding to miRNAs inside \nthe RISC \n \n-Under physiological conditions, they are generally \nunable to distinguish between miRNAs within the same \nfamily, especially those with identical \u201cseed regions\u201d \n \n-Used in vitro and in vivo to discover gene function, and \nsome AMOs are being tested in clinical trials \n\n \n-Unmodified anti-miRs are poorly suited to in vivo \napplications because they are incapable of penetrating \nnegatively charged cell membranes and are susceptible to \ndegradation by serum nucleases  \n \n-Chemical modifications are required to increase resistance \nto serum nucleases, to enhance their binding affinity, \nbiostability, specificity for the target miRNAs and to improve \ntheir entry into the cell \n \n-Most of the chemically modified AMOs show limited tissue \ndistribution when administered in the absence of a carrier, \nand are taken up by the liver and kidney and rapidly excreted \nin urine \n\nTable 1 - Overview of the available therapeutic strategies for reinstatement or inhibition of microRNAs. \n\n(reviewed in (Bumcrot et al., 2006;

MicroRNA manufacturing \n\nAs mentioned above, most miRNAs employed in the development of new therapeutic \n\napproaches, are manufactured either by enzymatic (in vitro transcription) or chemical (via \n\nphophoramidite solid-phase chemical synthesis) methods (Beckert and Masquida, 2011; Ling \n\net al., 2013; Milligan et al., 1987; Ponchon and Dardel, 2011; Sherlin et al., 2001). In the last \n\nyears, new advances in synthetic RNA chemistry were accomplished. Thereafter, the synthesis \n\nprocess has become more efficient, highly effective, and affordable for large scale production \n\nof RNA, however, the fidelity of the process is inversely correlated with the length of the \n\noligonucleotide being synthesized (El-Sagheer and Brown, 2010; Ponchon and Dardel, 2007). \n\nIn addition, the introduction of chemical modifications (see Table 2) in these strategies allows \n\nreducing the instability of RNA, as well as their degradation by cellular ribonucleases, \n\nincreasing the RNA half-life. In turn, this advantage makes difficult to obtain the RNA highly \n\npure and intact (Broderick and Zamore, 2011; Bumcrot et al., 2006; El-Sagheer and Brown, \n\n2010; Li and Rana, 2014; van Rooij and Kauppinen, 2014). Thus, additional purification \n\nprotocols to remove the contaminants (linearized plasmid DNA template, enzymes, free \n\nnucleotides, salts or buffer, short aberrant transcripts, failure in the sequences, among \n\nothers) derived from the synthesis process have to be employed in the final RNA product \n\n(Martins et al., 2014; Milligan et al., 1987). Actually, the presence of these impurities can \n\nlead to non-targeted gene silencing, what is commonly associated with a decrease in \n\ntherapeutic effectiveness and still restrict the implementation of these RNAs onto pre-clinical \n\nor clinical applications.  \n\nOn the other hand, miRNA therapeutics can also be obtained via expression systems of \n\nmiRNAs encoded by eukaryotic vectors. However, this alternative approach is generally less \n\nefficient because it is necessary to transcribe the DNA to RNA (Chen et al., 2007; Huang et \n\nal., 2011; Li et al., 2014; Ponchon and Dardel, 2007, 2011) and it is dependent of the action \n\nof the RNA polymerase. Thus, considering the rapidly growing interest on these novel \n\nbiopharmaceuticals, as a result of its potential therapeutic application, novel technologies to \n\nimprove their manufacturing are currently being pursued. Moreover, the success of any \n\ntherapeutic will depend on the easy production at large scale, while maintaining maximal \n\nproduct quality and biological activity. For all these reasons, it is required the development \n\nof economic and efficient methods for large-scale production of miRNAs.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 37 \n\nChemical Modifications Features \n\nPhosphorothioate (P=S) \n\n-Exchanges an oxygen atom by a sulfur atom in the phosphate backbone  \n-Inhibits uptake of the passenger strand into the RISC \n-Promotes binding to serum/plasma proteins, leading to longer serum retention times (half-life), which may \ninduce unwanted side effects, due to reduced clearance by glomerular filtration and urinary excretion \n-Enhances the resistance to nucleases and cellular uptake  \n-Keeps miRNA silencing function intact \n-Inhibits coagulation \n-Can cause cytotoxicity  \n-Activates complement  \n-Improves pharmacokinetic properties, facilitating their delivery into many peripheral tissues in vivo \n-Perhaps a better choice is modification boranophosphate (P=B) instead P=S substitution, which enhances \nnuclease resistance without causing cytotoxicity or damage to miRNA silencing function  \n\n2\u00b4-O-methyl (2\u2019-O-Me)  \n\n-Adds a methyl group (-CH3) to the second carbon of the ribose \n-Occurs naturally in rRNA and tRNA and is safe \n-Improves in vivo stability in the cytoplasm and increases the resistance to serum nucleases (enhancing half-life) \nby the closer proximity between the 2\u00b4group and 3\u00b4phospho-group \n-Enhances cellular uptake \n-Minimizes or inhibits the innate immune system activation, as it is a competitive inhibitor of TLR7 \n-Their introduction into nucleotides within the seed region, can reduce seed region mediated off-target effects \nwithout compromising silencing of the intended mRNA \n-When the sugars of both strands are replaced with 2?-O-methyl groups, the duplex loses its silencing ability \n\n2\u00b4-Fluoro \n\n-Adds a fluorine atom to the second carbon of the ribose \n-Increases in vivo stability and the resistance to exonucleases by the closer proximity between the 2\u00b4group and \n3\u00b4phospho-group \n-Decreases nonspecific immune stimulation and off-target effects \n-Can be introduced through endogenous transcription as opposed to chemical synthesis \n\n2\u00b4-O-(methoxyethyl) (2\u2019-MOE) \n-Adds a methoxy-ethyl group (-C3H7O) to the second carbon of the ribose \n-Increases in vivo stability and the resistance against nucleases in the serum by the closer proximity between \nthe 2\u00b4group and 3\u00b4phospho-group \n\nCholesterol conjugation \n\n-Addition of cholesterol functionality at the 3\u2019-position of the nucleic acid to generate \u2018antagomirs\u2019 \n-Enhances serum half-life by binding to serum albumin, improving stability and availability \n-Enhances the cellular uptake of the modified oligonucleotide by promoting its association with high-density \nlipoproteins (HDLs) and Low-density lipoproteins (LDL)-that can bind cell surface membrane receptors \n-Incorporation into HDLs can direct miRNAs to the liver, gut, kidney and steroidogenic organs and LDL-\nincorporated RNAs are primarily targeted to the liver  \n\nTable 2 \u2013 Chemical modifications used in miRNA modulators. \n\n(reviewed in (Broderick and Zamore, 2011;

So far, only few \n\nstrategies have emerged to produce stable recombinant miRNAs, namely for the biosynthesis \n\nof human mir-27b and human pre-miR-29b, using recombinant bacteria, such as Escherichia \n\ncoli (E. coli) and Rhodovulum Sulfidophilum (R. sulfidophilum) as preferential hosts, \n\nrespectively (Li et al., 2014; Pereira et al., 2014a). In general, the recombinant approaches \n\ncomprise several steps, starting with the selection and construction of appropriate expression \n\nvectors (Nagao et al., 2014; Ponchon and Dardel, 2011; Suzuki et al., 2010). After the \n\nestablishment of this step, it is possible to follow to the optimization and selection of the \n\nbest culture conditions (dissolved oxygen, temperature, stirring speed, pH and medium \n\nformulation) for miRNAs production by fermentation (Ponchon and Dardel, 2011). This \n\nstrategy is usually more cost-effective and simple than the synthesis methods, considering the \n\nlarge-scale production, allowing the costs reduction, but remaining highly efficient.  \n\n2.2. MicroRNA isolation \n\nThe RNA recovery, either from the recombinant production strategies using prokaryotic hosts \n\nor from a biological matrix (e.g. tissue samples, whole organisms, cell cultures, bodily fluids), \n\nrequires the employment of suitable methodologies for the extraction and isolation of target \n\nRNAs. In general, the procedure includes harvesting of cells by centrifugation and ultimately \n\ncell lysis to release the molecule of interest, since miRNAs are accumulated in cytoplasmic \n\nspace (Bernardo et al., 2012; Tan and Yiap, 2009).  \n\nUp until now, the most commonly used methods to isolate RNA are the guanidinium \n\nthiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction and the solid-phase extraction (SPE) (Bernardo et \n\nal., 2012; Chomczynski and Sacchi, 2006; Tan and Yiap, 2009; Vomelova et al., 2009). The \n\nfirst method, based on chemical extraction, consists in the disruption of cells using a solution \n\ncomposed by guanidinium thiocyanate, phenol and chloroform (see Figure 2), followed by \n\nprecipitation (Chomczynski and Sacchi, 2006). This organic extraction can also be carried out \n\nusing commercial available reagents, such as TRIzol\u00ae (Ambion), TRI (Sigma-Aldrich), RiboZol\u2122 \n\n(AMRESCO\u2019s) and NZYol (Nzytech), which are recommended to isolate intact and pure total \n\nRNA with high recovery yield, once endogenous ribonucleases are inactivated by the \n\nchaotropic agent used (cationic detergent guanidinium thiocyanate) (Bernardo et al., 2012; \n\nChomczynski and Sacchi, 2006). However, this chemical extraction is extremely toxic, \n\nbiologically hazardous and conveys health risks, which may strongly compromise the success \n\nof several RNA based-procedures in basic and clinical research, due to the use of denaturing \n\nagents (guanidinium thiocyanate and ?-mercaptoethanol) and organic solvents (alcohols) \n\n(Chomczynski and Sacchi, 2006; Tan and Yiap, 2009; Vomelova et al., 2009). Furthermore, \n\nthis RNA extraction involves multiple and complex processing steps that makes it a time-\n\nconsuming and laborious protocol.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 40 \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Flowchart of the main unit operations to be considered during manufacturing \n\nprocess of microRNAs. It is shown a comparison between the most common methodologies for \n\nobtaining miRNA from cells, tissues or E. coli with the recombinant production methodology \n\nin R. sulfidophilum. It is also indicated which are the impurities eliminated in each step. \n\n \n\nThe SPE is an adsorption method based on the ability of RNA to create a hydrogen-binding \n\ninteraction with specific surfaces, namely silica gel matrix or glass fiber filter (Tan and Yiap, \n\n2009; Vomelova et al., 2009). In general, in the solid-phase extraction, four steps are \n\ninvolved: i) cell lysis employing chemical extraction; ii) RNA adsorption to solid support (with \n\nthe aid of high pH and salt concentration in the binding buffer); iii) washing; and iv) elution \n\nof the desired RNA from the column (Bernardo et al., 2012; Tan and Yiap, 2009; Vomelova et \n\nal., 2009). Nowadays, there is a variety of commercially available extraction kits (e.g., \n\nQiagen (miRNeasy Micro Kit), Roche (High Pure miRNA Isolation Kit), Sigma\u2013Aldrich \n\n(mirPremier microRNA Isolation Kit), Invitrogen (Ambion\u00ae PureLink\u00ae miRNA Isolation Kit) and \n\nAmbion (mirVana miRNA Isolation kit)), based on SPE or exploiting a magnetic-bead based \n\nextraction technology, in order to isolate RNA molecules from different biological sources \n\nwith high quality, intactness and purity for further analytical or laboratorial applications \n\n\n\n \n\n 41 \n\n(Mraz et al., 2009). These methods significantly reduce sample preparation time, need less \n\nmanipulation and offer safer and simpler operations, allowing a quick and efficient \n\npurification of RNA compared to chemical extraction methods (Bernardo et al., 2012; Tan and \n\nYiap, 2009; Vomelova et al., 2009). However, some limitations are also associated with these \n\nprocedures, such as, low RNA yields due to the low binding capacity of the cartridges, and \n\nsometimes, the RNA isolation is achieved through the use of enzymes, namely DNases that are \n\nusually animal-derived and therefore are not accepted by the regulatory agencies due to the \n\nadverse effects of their pharmaceutical administrations. It is noted that throughout these \n\nextraction processes, several impurities are removed, such as cell debris, genomic DNA \n\n(gDNA) and some proteins, but it still remains a large quantity of impurities mixed with the \n\ntarget RNA, namely other small RNAs (sRNAs). \n\nIn what concerns to the recovery of RNAs from recombinant hosts, and along with the \n\naforementioned disadvantages, another major issue associated with the cell lysis of the \n\nprokaryotic host, E. coli, is the release of endotoxins, which can lead to the contamination of \n\nthe RNA sample (Wei et al., 2007). The importance of removing endotoxins is related to the \n\npossibility of these foreign components to originate adverse effects and inflammatory \n\nresponses to the patients (e.g. symptoms of toxic shock syndrome), if present in quantities \n\nhigher than those acceptable (Wei et al., 2007). In addition, as E. coli expresses several \n\nendonucleases, in particular RNases, it can be difficult to maintain the integrity of the target \n\nRNA, being always necessary to establish methods to avoid degradation (Wassarman et al., \n\n1999). For all these reasons, an ideal bioprocess must be designed to maximize recovery \n\nyield, to reduce the unwanted contaminants (sRNAs, gDNA, proteins, endotoxins, salts, \n\ndenaturing agents and organic solvents) and to minimize sample transfers. Nonetheless, and \n\nconsidering the therapeutic applications of these products, the major interest is not only to \n\nproduce high quantities of the target RNA but also to assure its quality, stability, integrity and \n\nbiological activity, fulfilling the requirements of regulatory agencies. \n\nTo accomplish this, an innovative recombinant bacteria, R. sulfidophilum, has been recently \n\nproposed and used to produce a pre-miRNA. It is non-pathogenic and presents several \n\nadvantages over E. coli, such as the unusual capacity of secretion of the heterologous nucleic \n\nacids directly into the culture medium and the absence of detectable host ribonucleases in \n\nthe culture medium (Ando et al., 2004, 2006; Suzuki et al., 2010). This prokaryotic host can \n\nintegrate a promising alternative technology, since it allows the recombinant biosynthesis and \n\nrecovery from the extracellular medium of biologically active miRNAs, circumventing the \n\nneed of cell lysis that frequently induces RNA denaturation. Besides, this strategy can be \n\nhighly advantageous regarding the RNA product safety, as it will not stimulate innate \n\nimmunity because the secreted miRNAs will be devoid of main bacterial associated impurities. \n\nMoreover, it is possible to minimize the contamination of the RNA fraction, by recovering the \n\nenriched-miRNA extracellular medium, in a specific stage of cell growth (see Figure 2). \n\nIndeed, it is expected that the application of this strategy allows suppressing the use of \n\n\n\n \n\n 42 \n\norganic and toxic solvents, and results in an increased RNA recovery yield, drastically \n\nreducing the amount and type of impurities present in the RNA extract, prior to purification. \n\nThus, this integrative approach of recombinant production and pre-miRNAs extracellular \n\nrecovery, is not only innovative but also presents more advantages than the conventional RNA \n\nisolation methods, being more economical, efficient, simple and fast in obtaining functional \n\nRNA. The recovery and isolation of miRNAs from fermentation broths can be performed using \n\nmembrane filtration or concentration techniques, designed to eliminate media components \n\nand metabolites and recover the target RNAs (Mor\u00e3o et al., 2011; Nunes et al., 2014; Nunes \n\net al., 2012). Figure 2 schematizes the most important steps to be considered during miRNAs \n\nmanufacturing. It is essential to optimize and improve all unit operations involved in the \n\nbiotechnological production and recovery of miRNAs, which will comprise a great benefit to \n\nthe implementation of a new platform on the biopharmaceutical industry, since the primary \n\nisolation conditions will also greatly influence the following purification strategy.  \n\n2.3. MicroRNA purification \n\nDuring the last decades, different methods and protocols have been extensively employed for \n\nthe purification of RNAs obtained either by synthesis or from biological sources, such as \n\npreparative denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and different chromatographic \n\nstrategies namely reversed-phase ion-pair liquid chromatography, anion-exchange and size \n\nexclusion chromatography, which can be applied either as an isolated or integrated steps \n\n(Easton et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2007; Koubek et al., 2013; McCarthy et al., 2009; Noll et al., \n\n2011). Although these methods can be very efficient for the purification of RNA with high \n\nresolution, some of these still require time-consuming preparatory steps and are expensive on \n\nlarge scale (Martins et al., 2014). On the other hand, these purification methods can cause \n\nstructural modifications and degradation of the RNA molecules and may even introduce some \n\ncontaminants, e.g. acrylamide, lithium metal, ion-pairing agents and organic solvents, \n\nrelated with the method (Easton et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2007; Koubek et al., 2013; Martins \n\net al., 2014; McCarthy et al., 2009; Noll et al., 2011). For these reasons, the RNA product \n\npurified by these strategies may require additional treatments to be suitable for the use in \n\nanalytical and clinical applications, and therefore it is difficult to maintain the stability and \n\nbiological activity of the target RNA. These challenges associated with RNA purification \n\nprocess, motivate the improvement of the already existing chromatographic techniques or the \n\ndevelopment of new purification approaches. \n\nIn the last years, the downstream strategies based on affinity chromatography have been \n\ndeveloped in an attempt to circumvent several challenges in RNA purification (reviewed in \n\n(Martins et al., 2014)). Most approaches described in affinity chromatography make use of \n\ntags (small sequences that are introduced in the RNA molecules) that bind with high affinity \n\nto specific molecules, used as ligands in chromatographic matrices for the selective \n\npurification of RNAs from cellular extracts (Di Tomasso et al., 2011, 2012; Pestourie et al., \n\n\n\n \n\n 43 \n\n2005; Ponchon and Dardel, 2011; Srisawat and Engelke, 2001, Srisawat et al., 2001). In most \n\ncases, the tag-RNA complexes can be released from the chromatographic support either by \n\ncompetitive elution or cleavage by a protease that recognizes a specific site that is \n\nincorporated along with the affinity tag (Martins et al., 2014; Srisawat and Engelke, 2001; \n\nSrisawat et al., 2001). Overall, although these chromatographic methods are rapid, reliable \n\nand efficient in obtaining the target RNA with high recovery yields and stability, they still are \n\nexpensive on large scale and labor intensive (Martins et al., 2014). In addition, the separation \n\nprocedures with RNA affinity tags make use of enzymes and may induce structural \n\nmodifications in RNA by the introduction of the tag sequences, which can affect the overall \n\nRNA topology (Srisawat and Engelke, 2002; Walker et al., 2008). \n\nA promissory approach to overcome these limitations includes the recent developed affinity \n\nchromatographic method using amino acids as specific ligands, which simulates and exploits \n\nbiological and reversible interactions that occur at the cellular level between amino acids and \n\nnucleic acids. The major advantage of this technique relies on the selectivity achieved, \n\nresultant from the combination of multiple non-covalent interactions (including electrostatic \n\nand hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals forces, cation\u2013? interactions, dipole\u2013dipole \n\nforces and hydrogen bonding) between the biospecific ligands (amino acids and derivatives, \n\nnamely O-Phospho-L-Tyrosine, L-Arginine, L-Lysine and Agmatine) and the target RNAs. The \n\ninteractions can be favored or disfavored by manipulating the binding/elution conditions, \n\nsuch as the temperature, pH and buffer composition (type of salt, ionic strength or presence \n\nof competitive agents) (Sousa et al., 2008). The use of amino acids in this chromatographic \n\nstrategy has the singular ability of purifying nucleic acids with high-selectivity, -specificity, -\n\nefficiency, robustness and durability (Lowe et al., 2001; Martins et al., 2014; Sousa et al., \n\n2008). The potential of amino acids-based affinity chromatography to obtain miRNA \n\nmolecules, in particular the recombinant human pre-miR-29b, from a complex extract, was \n\nrecently proved (Afonso et al., 2014; Pereira et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2014c).  \n\nAlthough, amino acids immobilized in bead-packed columns showed high selectivity in the \n\npurification of miRNAs, these supports present certain restrictions, such as low capacity and \n\nflow rates (Arrua and Alvarez Igarzabal, 2011; Pfaunmiller et al., 2013; Sousa et al., 2012). \n\nConsidering this limitation, an easier, reliable and more robust procedure for miRNA \n\npurification was developed, using a monolithic-based strategy, to improve the performance of \n\nthe biotechnological strategy, while maintaining the efficiency of the method (Pereira et al., \n\n2014c). Overall, the separation of the target miRNA from a crude sample was achieved, with \n\na good recovery yield, high purity level, good integrity and biological activity, due to the fast \n\nseparation and consequent short contact time with the support (Pereira et al., 2014c). \n\nAmongst the several chromatographic strategies implemented for miRNA purification, amino \n\nacids-based affinity chromatography allowed an improvement of many technical issues, \n\nincluding the analysis speed, the sensitivity and the separation conditions (use of mild salt \n\nconditions instead of organic compounds and enzymes). Furthermore, miRNA is separated in \n\n\n\n \n\n 44 \n\none single step, improving process economics over other less-selective and time-consuming \n\nmulti-step procedures (Afonso et al., 2014; Pereira et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2014c).  \n\nIn accordance, different affinity ligands (amino acids and its derivatives, peptides, \n\ncomplementary oligonucleotides sequences to the target miRNAs, among others) can be \n\ncharacterized and immobilized onto different chromatographic matrices (agarose-based, \n\nmonoliths, superporous matrices), in order to purify the RNA of interest from host \n\ncontaminants, thus minimizing non-targeted gene silencing and immunologic responses. \n\n2.4. MicroRNA quality control \n\nRNA purification is a critical step to obtain the product with suitable quality to be applied in \n\nseveral biomedical fields. At present, none regulatory authority (such as Food and Drug \n\nAdministration (FDA) centre for Drug Evaluation and Research, European Agency for the \n\nEvaluation of Medical Products (EMEA) or World Health Organization (WHO)) has formal \n\nguidelines available for RNA oligonucleotide products (Martins et al., 2014). Over the years, \n\nthe scientific community is providing the guidance in the regulatory framework for RNA-based \n\ntherapies based in the guidelines for plasmid DNA (pDNA) (Ferreira et al., 2000; Stadler et al., \n\n2004).  \n\nAs previously mentioned, miRNA quality depends on the manufacturing process, the cellular \n\nlysis step and the subsequent processes of isolation and purification, which must be carefully \n\ndesigned in order to reduce or eliminate the host impurities without loss or damage of the \n\nbiological activity of desired RNA. To accomplish this, a strict control of the process and \n\nassessment of the remaining impurities on the final sample is crucial, by using several \n\ncomplementary methods (Batkai and Thum, 2014; Chen et al., 2005; McGinnis et al., 2012; \n\nMoreno-Moya et al., 2014; Schleef and Schmidt, 2004; Smith et al., 1999; Stadler et al., \n\n2004). Table 3 describes several effective techniques that are commonly applied to evaluate \n\nthe quality and quantity of purified miRNA, and to verify if the requirements of regulatory \n\nauthorities are fulfilled. There are also commercially available analyzers to quantify and \n\nsimultaneously check the integrity of RNA samples (e.g. Bio-Rad Experion, Hercules, CA, or \n\nAgilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Santa Clara, CA). The implementation of methodologies able to \n\ncontrol RNA quality will be increasingly necessary, especially when the RNA products are \n\nfinally released to the market. To overcome this issue, convenient, sensitive and \n\nstraightforward analytical methods have been developed and validated to detect and quantify \n\nspecific miRNAs in unfractionated total RNA from different biological samples, namely whole \n\nblood, plasma, cells and some organs (such as liver, heart, brain, spleen, lungs and kidneys) \n\n(reviewed in (Batkai and Thum, 2014)). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 45 \n\nTable 3 - Accepted levels of impurities in final pDNA preparation for clinical applications, as \n\nrecommended by regulatory agencies (adapted from (Batkai and Thum, 2014; Chen et al., \n\n2005; Ferreira et al., 2000; McGinnis et al., 2012; Moreno-Moya et al., 2014; Schleef and \n\nSchmidt, 2004; Smith et al., 1999; Stadler et al., 2004)). \n\n \n\n3. Obstacles to effective microRNA therapeutics \n\nAs discussed earlier in this review, the therapeutic application of miRNAs is extremely \n\npromising due to the specific and efficient silencing of gene expression, as well as for its \n\nsimplicity, safety profile and ease of manufacturing. However, some problems must be \n\naddressed, namely the extracellular barriers, low bioavailability, rapid enzymatic degradation \n\nof miRNA by ubiquitous nucleases found in human serum, rapid renal clearance and \n\nphagocytosis by macrophages (Al-Dosari and Gao, 2009; Pathak et al., 2009; Tokatlian and \n\nSegura, 2010). Also, the intracellular barriers, such as inefficient cellular uptake and \n\nintracellular processing of endosome-targeted RNAs (escape from the endosome, vector \n\nunpacking and processing by the RNAi machinery) need to be surpassed before the \n\ntherapeutic gene arrives at the cytoplasm, allowing an improvement on miRNA \n\npharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties (Al-Dosari and Gao, 2009; Pathak et al., \n\n2009; Tokatlian and Segura, 2010).  \n\n \n\nComponent \nAccepted level in final \n\nproduct \nRecommended Assay \n\nHost RNA Undetectable \n\nAgarose gel electrophoresis \nPolyacrylamide electrophoresis  \nAnalytical High-Performance Liquid Chromatography  \nSpectrophotometric Method \n\nProteins Undetectable \nMicro-BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay  \nBradford assay \nSDS-PAGE \n\nGenomic DNA&lt;2 \u00b5g/mg pDNA \nReal-time Polymerase Chain Reaction  \nSouthern blot \nHybridization \n\nEndotoxins&lt;0.1 EU/\u00b5g pDNA Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay  \n\nmiRNA  \n\nPolyacrylamide electrophoresis \nElectrospray ionization mass spectrometry  \nTaqMan-based arrays  \nReverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction \nNorthern blot analysis  \nNuclease protection analysis \nPrimer extension assay \nMicroarray analysis \nIn situ hybridization assay \nComplementary DNA (cDNA) library construction  \nHigh-Performance Liquid Chromatography \nIn Vitro Translation \nLC-MS \n\n\n\n \n\n 46 \n\n3.1. Biological instability \n\nAs previously discussed, for the systemic delivery, unmodified naked miRNAs are highly \n\nsusceptible, due to their rapid degradation by cellular and serum nucleases, resulting in a \n\nshort half-life in the circulatory system (from several minutes to an hour) (Deng et al., 2014; \n\nGavrilov and Saltzman, 2012). Chemical modifications can increase the RNA stability but are \n\nalso associated with certain adverse effects, such as decrease on mRNA hybridization, \n\ninhibition of coagulation, activation of the complement cascade and cytotoxicity (see Table \n\n2) (reviewed in (Broderick and Zamore, 2011; Bumcrot et al., 2006; Deng et al., 2014; El-\n\nSagheer and Brown, 2010; Li and Rana, 2014; van Rooij and Kauppinen, 2014). For all these \n\nreasons, it is still necessary to customize, optimize and/or minimize the chemical \n\nmodifications, through the identification and modification only of the sites susceptible to \n\ndegradation.  \n\n3.2. Off-target effects \n\nThe in vivo specificity of miRNAs is based on sequence homology between miRNA and target \n\nmRNA. Thus a major challenge in developing miRNAs-based therapeutics remains in the \n\nassurance of RNA purity to minimize off-target gene silencing (Deng et al., 2014). \n\nNonetheless, miRNA-based therapeutics can sometimes induce non-specific side effects, i.e., \n\nsuppression of other non-target genes, which are as critical as effectiveness and duration of \n\nmiRNA expression or inhibition (as reviewed in (Singh et al., 2011)). The off-target effects can \n\narise through the partial homology of the nucleotides involved in the \u201cseed region\u201d of the \n\nendogenous miRNAs, and by effects related with competition of exogenous vectors and/or \n\nRNA species and endogenous miRNAs by the incorporation and retention into RISC, resulting in \n\nthe non-desirable gene silencing (Gavrilov and Saltzman, 2012). Another possible side effect \n\nis the saturation of the cellular machinery by miRNA processing, leading to aberrant \n\nprocessing of endogenous miRNAs by the accumulation of toxic precursors (pri-miRNAs, pre-\n\nmiRNAs, shRNA, stem-loop structures and high expression of miRNA mimics) (Singh et al., \n\n2011; Wang et al., 2011). This saturation interferes with the normal functioning of the cell, \n\nnot allowing access of the miRNAs in the natural pathway (Ballarin-Gonzalez and Howard, \n\n2012). Most of these undesirable and unspecific effects can be minimized without impairing \n\ntheir silencing capability, with small changes in miRNA sequences (chemical modifications) or \n\nby the use of miRNA mimics that are specific enough to distinguish between similar miRNAs. \n\nDespite of all the progress that has been made in the miRNAs-based therapeutics, it is still \n\nrequired more basic research on miRNAs to increase the efficacy and significantly reduce and \n\neventually eradicate off-target effects. \n\n3.2. Immune response  \n\nLong double-stranded RNA (e.g. vector-mediated expression of shRNAs, viral dsRNAs or other \n\ndsRNAs), as well as, siRNAs synthesized in vitro can, in some cases, trigger an innate immune \n\n\n\n \n\n 47 \n\nresponse via interaction with RNA-binding proteins such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and \n\nprotein kinase receptor (PKR) (Ballarin-Gonzalez and Howard, 2012; Deng et al., 2014). The \n\ninnate immune response is mediated mainly by activation of interferon and pro-inflammatory \n\ncytokines, after recognition of immunostimulatory sequence in the RNAs, such as specific GU-\n\nrich sequences (\u201cdanger motif\u201d), in particular 5\u2019-GUCCUUCAA-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-UGUGU-3\u2019 (Deng et \n\nal., 2014; Gavrilov and Saltzman, 2012). In this manner, there are several parameters \n\ndetermining the stimulation of innate immunity, namely structure and sequence of RNAs, \n\ndelivery vehicle, delivery route, cell type and species. To minimize these issues, appropriate \n\nchemical modifications as well as, the possibility to use miRNA delivery strategies can \n\nprevent, decrease and avoid the immunostimulatory properties (see Table 2). \n\nUnderstandably, immunogenicity and toxicity are grounds for concern that must be addressed \n\nin developing RNAi for therapeutic use. \n\n \n\n4. Delivery Strategies \n\nThe major challenge in the development of miRNAs-based therapeutics for clinical \n\napplications is the establishment of an effective mode to deliver these molecules to their \n\ntarget cells, specific tissues or organs, in order to exert their function, preventing unwanted \n\nside effects. The physicochemical properties of naked miRNAs interfere with their ability to \n\ncross the cell membrane by passive diffusion due to their negative charge, hydrophilicity and \n\nsize (7-20kDa) (Zabner et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 2013). In addition, naked miRNAs are \n\npreferentially accumulated by the kidneys and rapidly eliminated into urine within one hour \n\nbecause they are smaller than the size threshold for glomerular filtration.  \n\nIn the last years, a variety of different and efficient delivery approaches have been \n\ndeveloped and applied in gene therapy trials to promote cellular uptake and delivery of RNAs \n\ninto the cytoplasm of target cells, increasing the accumulation of the therapeutics in the site \n\nof interest, increasing the silencing potency, thereby making a given treatment dose more \n\neffective. In a simple way, delivery systems can be divided into two categories, viral vectors \n\nand non-viral vectors. However, each of these approaches has distinct advantages and \n\ndisadvantages, which require careful consideration (see Table 4). Initial research focused on \n\nthe use of viral vectors because these vectors displayed high efficiency at delivering miRNAs, \n\nboth in vitro and in vivo, taking advantage of their favorable cell uptake and intracellular \n\ntrafficking machineries, allowing long-term gene expression (see Table 4) (Mintzer and \n\nSimanek, 2009; Robbins et al., 1998; Walther and Stein, 2000). However, the focus has \n\nrecently changed to the non-viral approaches because of the advantages over viral vectors, \n\nsuch as ability to deliver the exogenous biopharmaceuticals into the cell/tissue-specific, non-\n\nimmunogenicity, high biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity (De Smedt et al., 2000; Nimesh \n\nand Chandra, 2009; Park et al., 2006). In addition, these non-viral vectors offer other \n\nadvantages such as relatively low production costs, high flexibility and easy quality control, \n\n\n\n \n\n 48 \n\nallowing designing carriers with well-defined structural and chemical properties on a large \n\nscale with high reproducibility and simplicity. Thus the potential for large-scale production \n\nmakes these non-viral vectors increasingly attractive for gene therapy (see Table 4) (Ahn et \n\nal., 2002). These vectors are also relatively stable to storage, they can be administered \n\nrepeatedly with no or little immune response and the dimension of the genetic material they \n\ncan carry is virtually unlimited. However, they also present some limitations such as the \n\nreduced transfection efficiency, due to the cellular barriers and immune defense \n\nmechanisms, poor oral bioavailability and instability in circulation (see Table 4). \n\nThe non-viral delivery systems include liposomes, lipoplexes, lipid-based delivery systems, \n\npolymers, cyclodextrins, dendrimers, polymeric micelles, pluronic block copolymers, \n\nexosomes and metallic core nanoparticles, allowing for RNA compacting for systemic delivery \n\n(see Table 4) (Chen and Xie, 2012; Cho et al., 2008; Gao and Huang, 2009; Hart, 2010; \n\nKabanov et al., 2002; Mintzer and Simanek, 2009; Morille et al., 2008; Patil and Panyam, \n\n2009; Yin et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2013).  \n\nConsequently, during the last decade a number of polymeric delivery systems, nanoparticles \n\nwith sizes between 10 and 100 nm, have been developed. These systems should contain a \n\npositively charged domain to efficiently bind the miRNAs molecules and facilitate the \n\nprogression of the transmembrane transport (Al-Dosari and Gao, 2009; Gupta et al., 2005; \n\nHart, 2010; Zabner et al., 1995). In these systems, the miRNAs can be loaded, adsorbed or \n\nchemically linked to their surface. The nanoparticle size is a critical factor for effective drug \n\ndelivery in vivo, since nanoparticles should be big enough to avoid fast clearance through the \n\nkidney excretion system but small enough to penetrate the target tissue. As mentioned, to be \n\neffective and to be considered ideal, there are several aspects to be carefully considered \n\nwhen developing the delivery vehicles, such as, safety, specificity and efficiency of gene \n\ntransfer; magnitude and duration of expression; immunogenicity and manufacturing (Pathak \n\net al., 2009). \n\nAfter entry into the target cells, miRNAs still face a number of hurdles before they can exert \n\ntheir gene silencing activity, since non-viral delivery systems are immediately transported \n\ninto the endocytic vesicles, initially, to the early endosomes where the pH drops to 6 \n\nfollowed by trafficking to late endosomes which are acidified to pH 5-6 (see Figure 3) \n\n(Caracciolo et al., 2009; Dominska and Dykxhoorn, 2010; Medina-Kauwe et al., 2005). Once \n\ntaken up into the endosome, the RNA has to escape in order to avoid subsequent degradation \n\nby lysosome (Caracciolo et al., 2009; Dominska and Dykxhoorn, 2010; Medina-Kauwe et al., \n\n2005). Even in the cell cytoplasm, miRNAs remain vulnerable to degradation by intracellular \n\nnucleases and still need to be incorporated into RISC with high efficiency, to exert the \n\nsilencing function (see Figure 3) (Nguyen et al., 2009; Suh et al., 2003).  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 49 \n\nNon-Viral Delivery \n(Cho et al., 2008; Gao and Huang, 2009; Hart, 2010; Mintzer and Simanek, 2009; Morille et

Targeting  \n\nIn the development of miRNAs-based therapies, delivery of miRNAs for the treatment of NDs \n\nis intrinsically limited because the delivery of all substances into the brain is tightly regulated \n\nby the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) (Edwards, 2001). Physiologically, the BBB is a unique \n\nstructure that separates brain from the rest of the body and their barrier function is due to \n\nanatomical features, namely the tight junctions formed between adjacent brain capillary \n\nendothelial cells in the brain tissues (see Figure 3) (Alam et al., 2010).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 Main barriers to successful in vivo delivery of nucleic acids using non-viral vectors. \n\n \n\nThis barrier prevents the transport of many harmful substances (foreign organisms, toxic \n\nchemicals, hydrophilic drugs and large molecules) present in the systemic blood circulation \n\ninto the brain and restricts the movement of ions and fluid into the brain (Alam et al., 2010). \n\nHowever, the BBB allows selective access of necessary nutrients (small gaseous agents, \n\nglucose, amino acids and small lipophilic molecules) and chemical signaling molecules to the \n\nnervous system (Egleton and Davis, 1997). Thus, the BBB controls substance flow in and out of \n\nthe brain with precision and strictness, ensuring an optimal environment for brain function, \n\nmaking the brain a site of poor permeability to various drugs as well as delivery systems. \n\nAnother important factor that limits and control the uptake, distribution and efflux of many \n\n\n\n \n\n 53 \n\ndrugs in the nervous system are the proteins presents in a variety of drug efflux transporters, \n\nsuch as P-glycoprotein (Kusuhara and Sugiyama, 2001), glucose-related transporters, \n\nnucleoside transporters, receptors for transferrin (Descamps et al., 1996, Visser et al., 2004), \n\nlactoferrin (Fillebeen et al., 1999), insulin (Frank et al., 1986), leptin, lectins, epidermal \n\ngrowth factor, insulin-like growth factors (Duffy and Pardridge, 1987; Reinhardt and Bondy, \n\n1994), as well as, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) (Candela et al., \n\n2008; Dehouck et al., 1997), reinforcing BBB function by effectively removing drugs from the \n\nbrain and pumping them back into blood. Because of this BBB transport restriction \n\nmechanism, more than 98% of candidate drugs have been abandoned during their \n\ndevelopment due to their poor permeability to cross the BBB, in sufficient quantities to \n\nproduce a therapeutic effect (Pangalos et al., 2007; Pardridge, 2005). These findings are \n\nattracting the attention of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries.  \n\nTo accomplish this purpose of targeted delivery, nanoparticles have been modified on the \n\nsurface with targeting molecules to improve their interactions with the BBB. As mentioned, \n\nthe surface of the brain endothelial cells of the BBB possess several transport mechanisms \n\nmediated by various specific receptors that potentially can be exploited as a means to target \n\ndrugs to the brain. Small molecules, peptides and proteins, such as angiopep-2 (van Rooy et \n\nal., 2011), certain apolipoproteins and lipoproteins (Candela et al., 2008; Kreuter et al., \n\n2002, 2007; Michaelis et al., 2006) directed to low-density lipoprotein receptor (Dehouck et \n\nal., 1997) and RVG (rabies virus glycoprotein) (Kim et al., 2013; Son et al., 2011) to GABA \n\nreceptor have been extensively used as brain-targeting ligands for the development of drug \n\ndelivery systems to the brain, trying the BBB crossing after intravenous administration. A \n\ncommon drug delivery strategy for targeting cells of interest is the conjugation with proteins, \n\nincluding lactoferrin (Fillebeen et al., 1999), TAT (transactivator of transcription) peptides \n\n(Santra et al., 2004) and transferrin (Descamps et al., 1996) that can effectively facilitate the \n\npassage of the BBB (Zhang et al., 2012). An alternative strategy to enhance drug delivery to \n\nthe CNS is the co-administration of a pharmacological modulator or a formulation component, \n\nin order to enhance brain penetration of various P-glycoprotein substrates through inhibiting \n\nthe P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux transport system of a desired therapeutic agent out of the \n\nbrain as, for example, Pluronic P85 (Batrakova et al., 2001; Yi and Kabanov, 2013).  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 54 \n\n5. Conclusion and Future trends \n\nMiRNAs are of particular interest in understanding complex disorders, such as NDs, because \n\nthey can potentially regulate several pathways involved in the insurgence and progression of \n\nthe disease. Recent developments have suggested that the use of miRNAs as \n\nbiopharmaceuticals will be possible in a near future and they will become not only important \n\nto treat ND, but may also be employed as biomarkers. The biopharmaceutical sector is an \n\nimportant and fast growing part of the wider global pharmaceutical industry, developing \n\nhealthcare products. However, the development and preparation of biopharmaceuticals poses \n\nmany technical challenges, including their production, recovery, purification and delivery into \n\nthe brain, which need to be addressed in order to carry these molecules into clinical trials. \n\nThus, it is necessary the development of effective technologies for miRNAs recombinant \n\nproduction and purification with the intent of obtaining large amounts of highly pure and \n\nthus, clinically suitable miRNAs, as an alternative to in vitro transcription or chemical \n\nsynthesis. Within the biotechnological domain, we believe that the integrative approach of \n\nextracellular production of stable structured RNA in vivo coupled to affinity-based \n\npurification using amino acids as ligands will enable the target pre-miRNAs isolation with high \n\nefficiency, selectivity, throughput, purity and integrity. The major gain in this field is the \n\npossibility to use these methodologies for the preparation of other non-coding RNAs, proving \n\nthe wide application of the technology, which may have a great impact on biopharmaceutical \n\nindustry. Furthermore, these approaches could contribute for the establishment of reliable \n\nand cost-effective processes, easily adopted by biopharmaceutical industries. In general, this \n\nreview reports the most recent improvements achieved with the preparation of recombinant \n\nmiRNAs that meet the required criteria established for clinical application. In addition, \n\nanother major bottleneck is to achieve a highly targeted delivery of biopharmaceuticals \n\nbecause only then it will be possible to create a significant opportunity to generate new \n\nhealth products useful for diagnosis and treatment of NDs. It is necessary to develop effective \n\nbrain drug delivery systems that must also be non-invasive, safe, with a low-cost and easy \n\nroute of administration, for increasing treatment efficacy and patient compliance, reducing \n\nsocietal service burden. The success of these targeted delivery systems preparation will be \n\nreally impacting since it will open the way for the delivery of numerous drugs to the brain, \n\nwith relevance not only in AD but also transversal to other neurodegenerative diseases. In \n\nfact, the surpass of all issues herein discussed, will lead to the establishment of more cost \n\nefficient processes that would reduce the time to application.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 55 \n\n6.

Nowadays, RNAi-based \n\ntechnology has emerged as a potentially powerful tool for silencing gene expression, being \n\nexploited to develop new therapeutics for treating a vast number of human disease \n\nconditions, as it is expected that this technology can be translated onto clinical applications \n\nin a near future. This approach makes use of a large number of small (namely short \n\ninterfering RNAs, microRNAs and PIWI-interacting RNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), \n\nwhich are likely to have a crucial role as the next generation therapeutics. The commercial \n\nand biomedical interest in these RNAi-based therapy applications have fostered the need to \n\ndevelop innovative procedures to easily and efficiently purify RNA, aiming to obtain the final \n\nproduct with high purity degree, good quality and biological activity. Recently, affinity \n\nchromatography has been applied to ncRNAs purification, in view of the high specificity. \n\nTherefore, this article intends to review the biogenesis pathways of regulatory ncRNAs and \n\nalso to discuss the most significant and recent developments as well as applications of affinity \n\nchromatography in the challenging task of purifying ncRNAs. In addition, the importance of \n\naffinity chromatography in ncRNAs purification is addressed and prospects for what is \n\nforthcoming are presented. \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nAffinity chromatography; Non-coding RNAs; RNA purification \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 70 \n\n\n\n \n\n 71 \n\n1. Introduction \n\nIn the late 1990s there have been significant advances in biology, in which one of the most \n\nimportant and remarkable discoveries was the new world of RNA interference (RNAi), leading \n\nto the use of RNA-based strategies for therapy [1,2]. Accordingly, the discovery that genes \n\ncould be silenced by RNAs allowed the biological understanding of other roles of RNA, which \n\nchanged from a simple intermediate molecule between DNA and proteins to a dynamic and \n\nversatile molecule, fundamental in the regulation of genes expression, involved in numerous \n\ncellular processes of all living organisms [1,3]. RNAi is defined as a highly conserved \n\nintracellular mechanism, involving the recognition and post-transcriptional control of specific \n\nmessenger RNA (mRNA), mediated by non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), that can result in the \n\nsilencing gene [3]. NcRNAs are a class of transcripts which, as the name implies, are not \n\ntranslated into proteins, but play important roles in the cellular function. A very simplistic \n\nclassification based on transcript size, arbitrarily separates these biomolecules into two \n\nmajor groups: the small (sncRNAs,&lt;200 nucleotides (nt) in length) and the long (lncRNAs, \n\nfrom 200 nt to approximately 100 kilobases) non-coding RNAs [4,5]. In turn, the small group \n\ncomprises infrastructural RNAs and regulatory RNAs. The infrastructural ncRNAs include \n\nribosomal, transfer, small nuclear and small nucleolar RNAs with well-known functions that \n\nare involved in the spliceosomal and translational machinery [4]. On the other hand, the \n\nregulatory ncRNAs include small interfering RNA (siRNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and \n\nmicroRNAs (miRNAs), among others [4,5]. In the last decade, several studies showed that \n\nmany of these small ncRNAs have important regulatory functions influencing almost all areas \n\nof cellular biology with a wide variety of molecular mechanisms. Another group of ncRNAs \n\ncomprises the lncRNAs, a highly heterogeneous group of transcripts that are the least well \n\nunderstood ncRNAs [6,7]. They have only recently emerged as a major category of regulatory \n\neukaryotic transcripts and are mostly involved in trafficking of protein complexes, genes and \n\nchromosomes to appropriate locations. \n\nConsidering the functions attributed to ncRNAs, presently they constitute the most promising \n\nclass of next generation therapeutics with a great potential to exert a revolutionary effect on \n\nmodern medicine [8]. However, enthusiasm vanished when it was realized that getting \n\nncRNAs to work as drugs was not as straightforward as originally thought. In addition, the \n\nmRNA molecules are also an attractive option in the development of new therapeutic \n\napproaches and, therefore, they have emerged as a new class of therapeutics due to the \n\nextremely important and fundamental roles that they play in all living cells. The ongoing \n\nresearch in this field includes the creation of vaccines for the treatment of cancer or \n\ninfectious diseases [9,10]. \n\nSynthesized RNAs have become an indispensable tool for biological sciences, namely in \n\nstructural, biochemical and biophysical studies, as well as in the development of new \n\ntherapeutic approaches using RNAi technology [11-13]. To date, ncRNAs used for therapeutic \n\n\n\n \n\n 72 \n\npurposes have mostly been produced by chemical or enzymatic (in vitro transcription) \n\nsynthesis [14]. Chemical synthesis is normally used for the generation of short \n\noligoribonucleotides (<50 nt) while in vitro transcription can produce longer RNAs. Although \n\nthese processes can be very efficient, the final RNA products typically present a maximum \n\npurity of 90%, what means that, depending on the application objective, additional \n\npurification protocols to remove the impurities derived from the synthesis process have to be \n\nemployed. Most impurities, often referred to as failure sequences, may lead to non-targeted \n\ngene silencing, what is commonly associated with a decrease in therapeutic effectiveness and \n\nstill restrict the implementation of these oligonucleotides onto pre-clinical and clinical \n\napplications [14,15].  \n\nOn the other hand, along with the RNAs obtained from chemical or enzymatic synthesis, the \n\nRNAi therapy can also be based in recombinant RNAs obtained after biosynthesis using \n\nprokaryotic hosts such as Escherichia coli or Rhodovulum Sulfidophilum which is usually more \n\ncost-effective than the chemical or enzymatic synthesis, considering the large-scale \n\nproduction [14,16-20]. Moreover, most of the biological RNAs have post-transcriptional \n\nmodifications that may not be reproduced under chemical or enzymatic synthesis and some of \n\nthe modifications are quite important for their function and structure [21]. However, in this \n\nstrategy, together with the target RNA that is being heterologous produced, other host RNA \n\nspecies are also produced, highlighting the need for an effective purification protocol to \n\nisolate the RNA of interest from other contaminants, thus minimizing non-targeted gene \n\nsilencing and immunologic responses [14]. \n\nThus, a major challenge in developing RNAi-based therapeutics remains the assurance of RNA \n\npurity to minimize off-target gene silencing. During the last decades, different methods have \n\nbeen extensively employed to isolate and/or purify of small RNAs obtained either by in vitro \n\ntranscription or from biological sources, such as denaturing polyacrylamide gel \n\nelectrophoresis, and some chromatographic techniques namely ion-pairing, reversed-phase, \n\nanion-exchange as well as size exclusion chromatography [22-28]. Overall, with these \n\nmethods, the purification of RNA still remains rather time-consuming, expensive, tedious, \n\ndifficult to scale up and can cause degradation of the RNA molecules (requirement of toxic \n\nsolvents and denaturing conditions) [22]. On the other hand, affinity chromatography \n\npurification represents a highly efficient strategy for RNA purification because it is very rapid, \n\nfacilitates the maintenance of RNA stability and can be easily adapted to any molecular \n\nweight RNA as well as high-throughput applications [22].  \n\nTherefore, the aim of this review is an overview of the current knowledge in the field of \n\naffinity purification techniques for ncRNAs purification. Finally, it will bring to discussion the \n\nimportance to recover pure ncRNAs, in accordance to the guidelines of the regulatory \n\nagencies for therapeutic application, with an emphasis on new experimental approaches, \n\nusing different affinity ligands, such as amino acids and amino acids derivatives. \n\n\n\n \n\n 73 \n\n2. Biogenesis of regulatory non-coding RNAs \n\nThe most important mechanistic features of RNAi will be briefly presented here to provide \n\ninformation regarding the physicochemical and molecular characteristics of RNA molecules \n\ninvolved and the type of interaction that is established along the processing.  \n\n \n\n2.1. Small interfering RNAs  \n\nsiRNAs are short mediators of RNAi that are originated from repetitive sequences, either \n\nsense-antisense pairs or long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) precursors designed specifically \n\nto silence expression of target genes (see Table 1) [29]. They can be introduced exogenously \n\ninto the cell in short form (e.g., synthetic siRNAs) or in the form of long dsRNA molecules \n\n[3,30]. After introduction into the cytoplasm, long dsRNAs are recognized and processed by a \n\ncombination of proteins including Dicer enzyme, ribonuclease (RNase) III, Tar RNA binding \n\nprotein (TRBP), and PACT into a short dsRNA (siRNA), with phosphate groups at both the 5? \n\nends along with hydroxyl groups and two nucleotide overhangs at both the 3? ends [3,5,30,31]. \n\nAfter processing, the siRNA consists of a sense strand and a complementary antisense strand. \n\nsiRNA duplex is then incorporated into the holoenzymatic complex, RISC (RNA-induced \n\nsilencing complex), where the strands are separated into the complementary antisense strand \n\n(or the guide strand) and the sense strand (or the passenger strand). The sense strand is \n\nsubsequently degraded and expelled by Argonaute-2 (AGO2) protein, a component of the RISC \n\n(as shown in Figure 1) [29,32,33]. Posteriorly, the antisense strand of the siRNA molecule, \n\nwhich is in the RISC complex, serves as a template to recognize a complementary region of \n\nthe target mRNA sequence, with a fully perfect complementarity. The resulting interaction \n\nsuppresses the gene expression, leading to the endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, which \n\nin-turn inhibits translation to the corresponding protein. After the silencing process, the \n\nfragments of the mRNA are released and the RISC is free to bind to another mRNA target and \n\nto start a new round of cleavage [5,31,32,34].  \n\nAs previously mentioned, it is also possible to silence gene expression via the siRNA pathway \n\nby direct introduction of chemically synthesized siRNAs or dsRNAs (see Figure 1). When \n\nsynthetic siRNAs are introduced into cells, they can directly engage with the RNAi machinery, \n\nwithout any processing steps, thus avoiding the Dicer catalyzed reaction [3,30]. However, \n\nsince the half-life of siRNA is short, a number of methodologies exist to take advantage of \n\nusing the Dicer machinery to produce siRNA within the cell from precursor siRNA molecules \n\n[29,31]. In fact, alternative RNA molecules such as plasmid expressed short hairpin RNAs \n\n(shRNA) are the most common (see Table 1) [29,30]. Generally, shRNA is transcribed in the \n\nnucleus from an external expression DNA vector (see Figure 1). The hairpin loop is \n\nspontaneously formed due to the complementary region, by RNA polymerase II or III. Then, \n\nthe shRNA transcript is processed by Drosha, an RNase III endonuclease.[3] The resulting pre-\n\nshRNA is exported to cytoplasm, where it is recognized by the cellular RNAi machinery and is \n\n\n\n \n\n 74 \n\nprocessed to form active siRNA by Dicer and incorporated into RISC [30]. In comparison to \n\nsiRNA, these shRNAs are constantly synthesized in host cells and have many advantages like \n\nlong-lasting silencing effects as well as easy delivery methods. Moreover, the preparation of a \n\nshRNA expression vector costs less than the bulk manufacturing of siRNA [3,29].  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - RNA silencing pathways and their essential components: siRNA; miRNA; piRNA. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 75 \n\n2.2. MicroRNAs  \n\nMiRNAs are a class of RNAi inducers, codified in the genome that can regulate gene expression \n\nat post-transcriptional level by mRNA degradation, translational repression or both \n\nmechanisms (see Figure 1) [4,35]. This regulation occurs through a sequential process \n\ninvolving a miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) and, subsequently, a mature miRNA that is \n\nincorporated into RISC to regulate the target mRNA. Thus, most miRNAs are processed from \n\nendogenously expressed transcripts [34,36]. RNA polymerase II produces long primary miRNAs \n\ntranscripts (pri-miRNAs, approximately >100 nt) containing the mature miRNA sequence, \n\nwhich possess a characteristic stem-loop structure and are afterward subjected to processing \n\nmechanisms [3,5,33,34]. In the nucleus, these pri-miRNAs transcripts are cleaved by a \n\ncomplex containing both the RNase III endonucleases Drosha and DiGeorge syndrome critical \n\nregion gene 8 (DGCR8), leading to generation of a corresponding precursor of miRNA (pre-\n\nmiRNA) [5,36]. The resulting product is RNA of 70-100 ntucleotides in length containing the \n\nlong hairpin like structure and a two nucleotide overhang at its 3?end [32,33]. The pre-miRNA \n\nis then actively transported to the cytoplasm by Exportin-5, a nuclear transport receptor \n\ncomplex. Once in the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA is further processed, where its loop is \n\nremoved by a complex that contains the enzyme Dicer, TRBP and PACT [34]. As a \n\nconsequence, pre-miRNAs are converted into mature miRNAs duplexes (miRNA-miRNA* \n\nduplexes, where miRNA is the antisense, or guide strand, and miRNA* is the sense, or \n\npassenger strand) (see Table 1) [3,5,32,36,37].  \n\nSubsequently, mature miRNAs are associated to Argonaute proteins, in particular AGO1 and \n\nAGO2, within the RISC complex. During loading, the sense strand, termed miRNA* is stripped \n\naway and targeted for degradation by Argonaute protein [34-36]. In turn, the miRNA antisense \n\nstrand, called mature miRNA strand, binds to the 3' untranslated regions (3\u2019UTR) of the target \n\nmRNA. Hence, the main mode of action of mature miRNA strand is the recognition of specific \n\nsites, typically present in the 3\u2019UTR of target mRNA [32,34,35]. This binding results in \n\ndegradation of mRNA transcripts when perfect base-pairing is present or induction of \n\ntranslational repression by blocking mRNA translation, when not perfectly base pairing \n\nprevails [3,5,35,36]. The general processing miRNA pathway is shown in Figure 1. \n\nIndeed, siRNAs and miRNAs are both processed by essentially the same RNAi machinery \n\n(Figure 1) due to their similarity in terms of the physicochemical and molecular \n\ncharacteristics (see Table 1). Nevertheless, they differ in the way that they recognize their \n\ntargets and interact to trigger RNAi. Typically, miRNAs have internal mismatches, creating so-\n\ncalled bulges in the secondary structure, whereas siRNAs usually have complete internal base \n\npairing and no bulging. On the other hand, siRNAs are directed to a particular mRNA target \n\nvia perfect complementarity, whereas single miRNA can regulate multiple mRNA targets via \n\nbinding with a number of mismatches [5].  \n\n\n\n \n\n 76 \n\nTable 1 - General properties of non-coding RNAs therapeutics. \n\nClass Mean Size (bp) Origin Structure Biogenesis Action mechanism [Ref.] \n\nmiRNA 21-25 Endogenous  \n\nDouble stranded \n\nTwo-step cleavage of hairpin precursors \n\nby Drosha and Dicer \n\nInduce translation \n\nrepression or mRNA \n\ndegradation \n\n[3,5,33,34] \n\nsiRNA 19-25 \nExogenous or \n\nendogenous \n \n\nDouble stranded \n\nCleavage of long endogenous dsRNAs by \n\nDicer \nInduce mRNA degradation [3,5,30,31] \n\nshRNA 19-29 Exogenous \n\n \n\n \n\nSingle stranded \n\nProcessed by Dicer to produce siRNA, \n\ntranscribed by RNA polymerase III \nInduce mRNA degradation [29,30] \n\npiRNA 24-31 Endogenous  \n\nSingle stranded \n\nTranscribed from specific genomic loci \n\nin primary piRNAs that associate with \n\nthe PIWI proteins \n\nCan lead to the target RNA \n\nmolecules degradation  \n[5,32,34] \n\nlncRNAs 200 to >100 Kb Endogenous   \n\nDouble stranded \n\nTranscribed of primary long non-coding \n\ntranscripts by RNA polymerase II into \n\nsmaller non-coding RNAs  \n\nInduce translation \n\nrepression or mRNA \n\ndegradation \n\n[5,7,38] \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 77 \n\n2.3. PIWI-interacting RNAs \n\nThe piRNAs are a class of sncRNAs widely expressed in different tissues and cell types, in \n\nparticular in germ line cells of mammals (see Table 1). The name of these ncRNAs results \n\nfrom the fact they associate to the PIWI family of proteins [5,32,34]. However, the \n\nintervening factors involved in the piRNAs biogenesis and transcription regulation mechanisms \n\nremain to be discovered [5]. Until now, it is only well known that the piRNA biogenesis \n\npathway is very different from that of miRNA and siRNA since it is generated by RNase III-\n\nindependent pathways that do not involve dsRNA precursors, neither Drosha nor Dicer (Figure \n\n1) [5,32,34]. Mostly, the piRNAs arise from long and single-stranded RNA precursors, derived \n\nfrom intergenic repetitive elements, transposons or large piRNA clusters, which are \n\ntransported via an unknown mechanism to the cytoplasm [30]. Once in the cytoplasm, they \n\nare associated with PIWI subfamily proteins, forming RNA-protein complexes (piRNP \n\ncomplexes) [32,34]. PIWI proteins are responsible for generating the 5? end of the piRNA, but \n\nthe nuclease that creates the 3? end has yet to be identified (Figure 1) [5,32]. On the other \n\nhand, these antisense piRNAs can undergo a cycle of amplification, called ping-pong cycle, to \n\ngenerate secondary piRNAs in the cytoplasm [34]. Specifically, in mouse, piRNA-mediated \n\ntransposon repression, predominantly, happens via DNA methylation [5,32].  \n\n2.4. Long non-coding RNAs  \n\nLncRNAs represent the most recent breakthrough in the field of RNAi, as pivotal molecules for \n\nthe regulation of gene expression, since they bind to the mRNA with little or no protein-\n\ncoding capacity (see Table 1). LncRNAs form a significant part of the eukaryotic \n\ntranscriptome, regulating the expression of up to 70% of genes, although they are among the \n\nleast well understood ncRNAs. Many identified lncRNAs are transcribed of primary long non-\n\ncoding transcripts by RNA polymerase II into sncRNAs [5-7]. Nonetheless, according to their \n\npositional location with relation to protein-coding genes, the lncRNAs can be placed into \n\ndiverse categories, namely sense, antisense, bidirectional, intronic and intergenic. In \n\naddition, some studies demonstrated that lncRNAs might also be produced by transcriptional \n\nactive pseudogenes [5,6,38]. Despite all the efforts, the origins of lncRNAs are not yet clearly \n\ndefined and understood. Thus, another classification have been used to establish the classes \n\nof lncRNA, according with the transcriptional origins, such as promoter-associated long RNAs \n\n(lpaRNAs), natural antisense transcripts (NATs), large intervening non-coding RNA (lincRNA), \n\nand enhancer associated RNAs (eRNA) [5,7]. The cellular location of lncRNA is also varied and \n\nmay imply its function, since they can be found in nucleus, cytoplasm, or into specific sub-\n\ncellular compartments (p.e. mitochondria) [5,7,38].  \n\nThe majority of lncRNAs are transcribed from the nuclear genome but some can be generated \n\nfrom mitochondrial genomes. LncRNAs typically have the same structural features as mRNA, \n\nincluding 5\u2019capping, polyadenylated 3\u2019 tails and undergo alternative splicing to give rise to \n\nthe final product. In general, the lncRNAs may be located within nuclear or cytosolic fractions \n\n\n\n \n\n 78 \n\nand may be polyadenylated or non-polyadenylated [5-7,38]. In 2013, it was demonstrated \n\nthat several lncRNAs can be spliced at their 5\u2019 and 3\u2019-ends to give stable circular RNAs \n\n(circRNAs) [39]. These circRNAs form an important class of post-transcriptional regulators \n\nwith unknown function. However, recent data indicated that circRNAs compete with other \n\nRNAs for binding by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) or miRNAs, and have function as negative \n\nregulators of miRNAs [39]. Therefore, their targets can be either coding or non-coding RNAs, \n\nand can positively (concordant regulation) or negatively (discordant regulation) modify the \n\nexpression or processing of their target genes.  \n\n \n\n3. Therapeutic potential of regulatory non-coding RNAs  \n\nOver the past ten years, a growing number of studies have shown that many of the ncRNAs \n\nplay important roles in the cellular function, establishing ncRNAs as a promising next-\n\ngeneration therapeutic drug [5,8]. In fact, RNAi-based technology possesses attractive \n\ncharacteristics such as high specificity, efficiency and ability to induce a robust and potent \n\nknockdown of the targeted genes. In addition, another advantage of RNAi over other \n\ntherapies is the possibility to promote a long-lasting therapy (the therapeutic effect lasts \n\nfrom days up to weeks), reducing the expenses of medical treatments. Usually, the dosage \n\nrequired of ncRNA therapeutics is low, which can reduce or eliminate the occurrence of \n\nundesirable adverse effects in the patient [33].  \n\nFor all these reasons, RNAi has become one of the most powerful and widely used tools for \n\nthe study of gene function/expression. Furthermore, RNAi has also been used to develop new \n\nalternative approaches, in order to regulate several pathways involved in the origin and \n\nprogression of many gene-related diseases [3,5,7,8]. Presently, this biomedical approach is \n\nbeing considered in numerous clinical trials focusing distinct types of cancers, viral infections, \n\nmetabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease, hypertension and stroke, immune dysfunction and \n\nauto-immunity, neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases [3,5,7,29]. These novel therapies \n\nfocused on the specific gene expression control can contribute to the regulation of a variety \n\nof physiological and biological/cellular processes as diverse as development, cell cycle \n\nregulation (DNA repair), proliferation, differentiation, cell adhesion, apoptosis, stress \n\nresponse, metabolism, stem cell self-renewal, embryogenesis and neurogenesis [5-7,38].

RNAi affinity-chromatography  \n\nThe promising and successful results of these novel therapeutic approaches reinforced the \n\ninterest on RNA investigation, which led to an increase in the number of structural, \n\nbiochemical, biophysical and biomedical studies, allowing the emergence of RNA as a new \n\nclass of biopharmaceuticals [8,40]. Nowadays, and considering the therapeutic application of \n\nthese biomolecules, the major interest is not only to produce high quantities of ncRNAs but \n\nalso to obtain and preserve its good quality and biological activity, fulfilling the requirements \n\nof regulatory agencies, such as Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Medicines \n\nAgency (EMA) and World Health Organization (WHO) [22]. \n\nIn general, purification protocols used for RNA isolation have a number of common \n\nrequirements, due to the high risk of RNA degradation during the procedure. RNA is an \n\nunstable molecule and has a very short half-life once extracted due to the ubiquitous \n\npresence of RNA-degrading enzymes (RNases) which are present in biological samples, \n\naqueous buffers, on labware and can be introduced via human handling [41]. Consequently, \n\none of the most important concerns when working on purification of RNA is the adjustment of \n\nall working conditions in order to improve the performance of the biotechnological strategy, \n\nbut always guaranteeing the structural and functional stability of ncRNAs to maintain their \n\nbiological activity. \n\nThus, in the last years, the downstream strategies based on affinity chromatography evolved \n\nand now represent a highly efficient strategy for RNA purification and have been \n\nimplemented in order to increase the yields and the selectivity, contributing for the \n\nestablishment of reliable and economical processes to assure a strict quality in production of \n\ntherapeutic biomolecules [22,42,43]. In general, these strategies are time-efficient, occur \n\nunder non-denaturing conditions and can be easily adapted to any molecular weight RNA as \n\nwell as high-throughput applications. However, they also do present some limitations, \n\nparticularly in regard to the biological origin of the ligands [44] (see Table 3).  \n\nAffinity chromatography is a powerful technique in the development of therapeutically useful \n\nproducts that uses biological agents as specific ligands to analyze, identify and purify RNA on \n\nthe basis of their biological function or individual chemical structure [22,42,45]. The binding \n\nbetween the target biomolecules and the affinity ligand is specific, selective and reversible. \n\nThereby, this approach simulates and exploits natural biological multiple non-covalent \n\ninteractions occurring at the cellular level and involved in the molecular recognition of many \n\nbiological phenomena, for the selective and efficient purification of the target biomolecules \n\n[45,46]. Hence, the binding mechanism inherent on the specific biorecognition of the target \n\nbiomolecule by the specific ligand results from the combination of multiple intermolecular \n\nforces, such as electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and cation\u2013? \n\ninteractions, as well as van der Waals forces and dipole\u2013dipole forces [43,45,47]. However, \n\n\n\n \n\n 81 \n\ndepending on the environmental conditions used, some interactions can be preferentially \n\nestablished than other, becoming more evidenced. This distinctive capacity to establish \n\ndifferent types of interactions is a major advantage of this kind of chromatography, resulting \n\nin a technique with extremely high selectivity and resolution [22,43,45]. On the other hand, \n\nthe exploitation of the affinity interactions can trigger new insights not only in isolation \n\nstrategies but also in many other RNA research fields owing to its implication in molecular \n\nrecognition phenomena. \n\nIn affinity chromatography, the choice of the matrix and conditions to be used will depend on \n\nthe molecular properties of the target biomolecules and the physicochemical and \n\nthermodynamic nature of their molecular interactions. Moreover, the elution of a target \n\nbiomolecule that is bound to the affinity ligands can be achieved either specifically, using a \n\ncompetitive ligand, or non-specifically, by changing the pH, ionic strength or polarity \n\ndepending on the matrix used and the chemical characteristics of the biomolecules [22,48]. \n\nThe addition of a competing agent in the elution buffer, known as biospecific elution, is \n\ncommonly employed in order to improve the selectivity as well as to get higher elution \n\nefficiency [16,49]. The competing agent can bind to the retained target or to the immobilized \n\nligand, depending on their characteristics, thus allowing predicting the interactions that can \n\nbe involved.  \n\nMost ligands used in affinity chromatography such as amino acids, peptides and proteins are \n\nof biological origin, although they tend to be fragile, showing low binding capacities. \n\nCurrently, to address this issue, new strategies have been developed focusing on the search \n\nand design of new synthetic molecules to be further employed as affinity ligands [44]. This \n\napproach intends to combine the selectivity of natural ligands, with high capacity, \n\nrobustness, durability and reproducibility of synthetic systems for the purification of \n\nbiomolecules. Another issue to take into account is the materials typically employed into \n\nchromatographic matrices, namely beads, gels or membranes manufactured from raw \n\nmaterials [48,50]. Therefore, the ideal support for the separation and purification of RNA \n\nmust present diverse characteristics namely high selectivity/specificity and binding capacity, \n\nmechanical and chemical stability and low cost. The design of selective ligands and matrices \n\nfor RNA purification can be complex, time-consuming and expensive, though their \n\nimplementation into affinity chromatography processes result in significant economic \n\nbenefits, such as reduction of downstream steps and the improvement of the product quality, \n\ntherefore justifying the initial investments [43,45,51].  \n\nAffinity chromatography can have a widespread application in ncRNAs preparation in view of \n\nRNA structural properties (size, charge, hydrophobicity) and versatility in biological function \n\nthat includes interaction with many molecules in the cell. The stranded nature of RNA (single \n\nand double), which is normally involved in RNA recognition due to the high nucleotide bases \n\nexposure and accessibility for interactions also influences the purification process [52]. These \n\n\n\n \n\n 82 \n\nproperties and features continue to make affinity chromatography a popular method and a \n\nuseful and important tool in the development of biopharmaceuticals and/or clinical testing. \n\nBelow it will be discussed different types of affinity chromatography that have been utilized \n\nfor the purification of ncRNAs. The advantages and limitations of these methodologies applied \n\nfor the affinity isolation of RNA molecules are discussed in Table 3. \n\n4.1. Boronate affinity chromatography \n\nSince the 1970s, one of the most commonly used affinity techniques in the isolation of RNA \n\nmolecules is the boronate affinity chromatography (Table 3) [53]. In this affinity technique is \n\nexploited one of the few chemical differences between RNA and DNA, the presence of cis-diol \n\ngroups of ribose sugar at the 3' end of the RNA molecule and their absence in the deoxyribose \n\nbackbone of DNA [54-57]. Thus, RNA molecules are specifically purified from the mixture of \n\nnucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and other biomolecules due to the specific and reversible \n\ninteraction between diol moieties which are in a cis configuration and the boronate ligands \n\n[54-57]. This interaction is dependent on acidic and basic experimental conditions. However, \n\nother interactions can also play an important role in the separation of nucleic acids in the \n\nboronate affinity methods, namely hydrophobic (due to the phenyl ring present in aromatic \n\nboronate ligands), ?-? (can also occur with phenyl groups), ionic (due to the negative charge \n\nof the active tetrahedral boronate), hydrogen bonding (due to the presence of two hydroxyl \n\ngroups) and coordination (because the boron atom has an empty orbital, it can serve as an \n\nelectron receptor for charge transfer interaction) interactions [58]. Several boronate \n\nfunctionalized packed column systems have been developed for the selective separation of \n\nRNA from the nucleic acids mixture, including dextran and cellulose derived bipolar 2-[(4-\n\nboromophenyl)-methyl]-ethylammonium] ethyl solution polymer system [59], thermo-\n\nresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-(vinylphenylboronic acid) [poly(NiPAAm-co-VPBA)] \n\nlatex particles [60], aminophenyl boronic acid (APBA) modified hydrogel beads [61], \n\nmonolithic \u2018cryogel\u2019 matrices [62] and monolithic silica columns [63]. \n\n4.2. RNA affinity tags \n\nIn last years, RNA affinity tags have emerged as useful tools for the isolation of RNAs, \n\nallowing the development of easy, reliable, fast and more robust procedures for native RNA \n\npurification of long constructs produced by in vitro transcription methods, providing highly \n\npure RNA preparations (Table 3) [64]. The selection of several oligoribonucleotides sequences \n\nfunctioning as tags for RNA affinity purification (such as, RNA aptamers) with the desired \n\nproperties and ability to bind specifically and with high affinity to a specific ligand has been \n\nperformed using the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (SELEX) \n\nmethod [64,65].  \n\nTo date, a limited number of highly specific RNA affinity tags have already been successfully \n\nused for the purification and selective recovery of the tagged RNAs. RNA affinity tags are \n\n\n\n \n\n 83 \n\nbased on RNA-protein interactions found in nature and are inserted in the target RNAs \n\nmolecules, during in vitro transcription [14]. Moreover, the tags should bind with high affinity \n\nto a ligand that can either be immobilized on a chromatographic matrix or be conjugated to \n\nan antibody detection system [14,64]. Thus, the purification of RNAs from cellular extracts is \n\nthen achieved using an affinity column with a specific RNA-binding protein immobilized, in \n\nsuch a way that the formed complex can be selectively and gently dissociated afterwards (see \n\nFigure 2). The protein affinity tags include polyhistidine [66], myc epitope [67], the tandem \n\naffinity protein (TAP) tag [68], protein A [69], MS2 coat protein [70], glutathione S-\n\ntransferase [71], Streptavidin-tag [72-73] and the FLAG epitope [74]. In these strategies, in \n\norder to recover the bound RNA of interest it can be used competitive elution (with biotin or \n\ndextran) or cleavage by a protease with a recognition site that is incorporated along with the \n\naffinity tag [75-78]. In addition, some tagged RNAs do not cleave even after prolonged \n\nincubation, presumably due to alternate and unpredictable secondary structures at the \n\ncleavage site. Thus, in general, these methods can induce structural modifications in RNA \n\nmolecules, which can affect the overall topology of the RNA construct, as well as significantly \n\ndegrade the target biomolecule and compromise the final purification. Generally, the limiting \n\nstep when is used a known RNA-protein interaction as part of the affinity purification is the \n\ninability to efficiently elute or release the purified complex under native conditions since the \n\nbinding affinity of the known RNA-protein interaction is usually high [73,79,80].  \n\nIn line with previous expectations, several alternative schemes have been developed for fast \n\nnon-denaturing purification of RNA transcribed in vitro. In 2007, Batey and Kieft developed an \n\naffinity-based method that utilizes a MS2 coat protein binding stem\u2013loops as affinity tags at \n\nthe 3\u2019end of the RNA transcript, which bind to the nickel-affinity matrix via interaction with \n\nthe hexahistidine-tagged MBP(maltose binding protein)-MS2 coat protein fusion for native RNA \n\npurification produced by in vitro transcription methods [81]. This RNA tag is preceded by the \n\nglmS ribozyme sequence which is activated by glucosamine-6-phosphate, removing the tag \n\nused at the end of the RNA transcript, to induce the specific elution of the desired RNA [81]. \n\nThis affinity purification methodology for native RNA purification is robust, rapid and broadly \n\napplicable to any RNA of interest, being easily accessible to a wide range of researchers with \n\nminimal difficulty. On the other hand, in a recent report, a quick affinity purification \n\nprocedure was developed for RNAs transcribed with a 3\u00a2-ARiBo tag and shown to provide RNA \n\nwith exceptionally high purity and yield [82-85]. The ARiBo tag contains the ? boxB RNA and \n\nthe glmS ribozyme, allowing immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose resin via a ? N-GST \n\nfusion protein and elution by activation of the glmS ribozyme with glucosamine-6-phosphate \n\n[84]. The use of RNA tags containing ribozymes has been shown to substantially simplify the \n\nprocedure, since no additional purification steps other than a buffer exchange are required \n\nafter the RNA elution. After several matrix washes to remove impurities from the \n\ntranscription reaction, the RNA of interest is eluted by activation of the self-cleaving \n\nribozyme (see Figure 2) [82-85].  \n\n\n\n \n\n 84 \n\nOverall, although these robust affinity purification methodologies can be very efficient for \n\nrecovering RNA with high quality and quantity, they still are expensive on large scale and \n\nlabor intensive. Besides, the purification of RNA produced by in vitro transcription requires in \n\nsome cases more than one purification step or the application of denaturing conditions in \n\norder to achieve higher RNA enrichments (Table 3) [64,76,86]. Therefore, the challenges \n\nassociated with RNA purification motivate the improvement of the already existing \n\nchromatographic techniques or the development of new purification approaches. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 The general scheme for the native purification of the desired sequence (RNA X) \n\nand the amino acids-based affinity chromatography of the recombinant RNA. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 85 \n\nTable 3 \u2013 Overview of available affinity chromatography methods used in bioseparation of non-coding RNAs therapeutics.  \n\nMethods Target RNA Advantages Limitations [Ref] \n\nBoronate affinity \n\nchromatography \ntRNAs \n\n-Isolation of RNA molecules from crude cell extracts; \n\n-Requires no sample pre-treatment; \n\n-High purity and quality of purified RNA, since the steps \n\ninvolved are very fast; \n\n-Efficient elimination from genomic DNA; \n\n-It is less sensitive to quantitative errors caused by minor \n\nfluctuations in reagent pH and ionic strength. \n\n-Non-specific interaction can be avoided by using inert \n\nhydrophilic polymers for matrix synthesis; \n\n-In some cases, stepwise or gradient elution can give better \n\nresults; \n\n-Sometimes, the column must be washed with 6 M urea prior to \n\nwashing with the regeneration buffer. \n\n[54-63] \n\nRNA affinity tags \n\nlincRNA \n\nshRNA \n\nmiRNA \n\nmiRNA-mRNA complex \n\nRNA oligonucleotides \n\n-Reliable, rapid and robust methodologies for native RNA \n\npurification using affinity tags on inherent biologic \n\ninteractions; \n\n-Broadly applicability to any RNA of interest, making this a \n\nuseful method to a broad spectrum of the RNA research \n\ncommunity; \n\n-Allow the production of milligram quantities \n\n-Stability of affinity tags; \n\n-High recovery and purity due to the specific selection of \n\nthe tags with high affinities for the resins (high-quality \n\nRNA). \n\n-Elution of the complex can be achieved under denaturing \n\nconditions or through the use of a competitor oligonucleotide \n\nto release the RNP under native conditions, in order to achieve \n\nhigher RNA enrichments.

Amino acid-based affinity chromatography  \n\nIn the past few years, a new affinity methodology called amino acid-based affinity \n\nchromatography has been successfully developed to efficiently purify different RNA species \n\n[22]. Indeed, several studies are already available demonstrating the applicability of amino \n\nacids (namely L-Arginine, L-Histidine, L-Lysine and O-Phospho-L-Tyrosine), as specific affinity \n\nchromatographic ligands, in the purification/separation of diverse RNA molecules, such as \n\ntotal RNA, ribosomal RNA, tRNA, 6S RNA and pre-miRNAs (in particular, pre-miR-29b), using \n\nconventional particle-based columns (amino acids-agarose matrices) [16,17,87-91]. These \n\nresults demonstrated the versatility, exceptional ability and the potential of the amino acids \n\nto strongly interact with all functional classes of RNA, despite their structural diversity and \n\ndifferent folding states, as they are in their native state. Amino acid-based affinity \n\nchromatography is a powerful technique that has been used as an improved, very specific and \n\neffective bioseparation methodology for the purification of RNA molecules that exploits \n\nnatural affinity interactions occurring between amino acids and RNA [22,45]. These studies \n\nwere based on the fact that many several specific interactions exist between proteins and \n\nnucleic acids in biological systems, involving particularly basic amino acids [22,45,92,93]. For \n\nexample, Calnan and co-workers demonstrated that arginine residues are important for \n\nspecific RNA recognition, even with different conformational rearrangements and that \n\narginine-base interactions have been recognized as the most prevalent interactions in several \n\nprotein-RNA complexes [93]. Thus, this type of selectivity can be explained on the basis of \n\nthe biological function or chemical structure of the RNA, which favors the interaction.  \n\nIn general, the RNA structural features (namely, negative charge of the RNA backbone and \n\nsingle-stranded nature) seem to be relevant for the specific interactions established between \n\nthe RNA and the amino acids used as immobilized ligands [92,94]. Nonetheless, the high base \n\nexposure on RNA species was also suggested to have a crucial role in the RNA recognition and \n\non its distinct retention behavior. Recently, the structural diversity of RNAs was described to \n\nbe of significant importance in RNA-protein interactions because RNA can exhibit different \n\nmoieties according to its folding state, for example RNA hairpins and bulges form stable \n\ntertiary structures that contributes substantially to their recognition [47,95,96]. On the other \n\nhand, the salts used in the chromatographic conditions can also have a profound positive \n\neffect on RNA folding as well as on the stability of non-covalent RNA-amino acid interactions \n\nduring the course of purification, once the salt allows that single-stranded nucleic acid \n\nmolecules form stable hydrogen bonds between their complementary bases [96,97].  \n\nAdditionally, this type of selectivity can also be explained in light of the atomic and \n\nmolecular recognition studies performed on RNA-protein complex structures have predicted \n\npreferential interactions/contacts occurring between particular amino acids side chains and \n\nspecific nucleotides either involving the RNA bases or through a defined conformation of the \n\nRNA backbone phosphates (e.g. arginine fork is defined as an interaction between a arginine \n\n\n\n \n\n 88 \n\nand a pair of adjacent phosphates, which mediates specific recognition of RNA structure) \n\n[93,98-100]. For instance, several studies have shown that some amino acids, in particular \n\narginine has strongly favored interaction with guanines bases along the bulge and through the \n\ncontinuous stem sequences of the RNA, involving H-bonding [92,93]. In general, these \n\nevidences showed that the specific interaction that lead to a biorecognition of different RNA \n\nmolecules by the amino acids seem to be dependent on the base composition, RNA backbone \n\nand RNA conformational rearrangement. Globally, the development of this isolation \n\nmethodology allowed recovery and efficiently separate of the target RNA while the quality \n\ncontrol analysis showed a high efficiency, selectivity and integrity in RNA preparations as well \n\nas good purity in what concerns to host RNAs, proteins, genomic DNA and endotoxins (Table 3) \n\n[16,17,87-91]. Overall, in a single step, affinity purification can offer several advantages over \n\nother less-selective and time-consuming multi-step procedures (see Figure 2). \n\nAlthough, amino acid ligands immobilized in conventional chromatographic columns of \n\nagarose showed high selectivity for RNA purification but a faster and more robust purification \n\nmethod will benefit ncRNAs isolation since it will possibly have important implications in RNA \n\nstability. In addition, available conventional columns (particle-based supports) present \n\ncertain restrictions, namely limitations with the mass transfer, low capacity, gel \n\ncompressibility and poor pore diffusion leading to high pressure drops and low flow rates \n\napplication - all of which incur process time and cost [50]. These disadvantages have driven \n\nresearchers to develop alternative chromatographic supports capable of maintaining the \n\nefficiency of the established processes while improving their limitations. One of these new \n\ngenerations is the monolithic supports whose application has been increasing owing to their \n\nstructural properties [48,50,101,102]. \n\nIndeed, monolithic supports present several advantages, namely a huge quantity of accessible \n\nbinding sites (high binding capacity), high external porosity, high sample distribution and \n\nexcellent mass transfer properties [48,101]. Moreover, monoliths allow the application of \n\nhigher flow rates, a very fast separation, short analysis times and purification with high \n\nreproducibility both at small and large scales, which reduces the biomolecules degradation \n\ndue to the shorter contact time with the chromatographic support. Thus, due to their \n\nexcellent morphological, physicochemical and mechanical properties, monolithic supports \n\nhave attracted attention for the use in high-throughput separations, coupled to a variety of \n\naffinity ligands, both at research and industrial scales. In 2014, our research group showed \n\nthe possibility of exploring and characterizing the interactions occurring between pre-miR-\n\n29b and an agmatine amino acid derivative immobilized into a monolithic disk [49]. As a \n\nmatter of fact, for the first time, the selectivity, specificity and biorecognition of agmatine \n\nligands was combined with the structural versatility and capacity provided by monolithic \n\nsupports, as a promising strategy for miRNA purification [49]. Additionally, this monolithic-\n\nbased strategy represents an advantageous alternative to conventional supports due to the \n\nfast separation and consequent short contact time with the chromatographic matrix, ensuring \n\n\n\n \n\n 89 \n\nstructural stability of the target molecule (reduces RNA degradation). The successful results \n\nobtained in the isolation of several RNA species revealed an efficient affinity methodology to \n\nobtain RNA with high purity and good integrity, with potential applicability in several RNA \n\nbased-procedures in basic and clinical research. \n\n \n\n5. Conclusions and Future perspectives  \n\nIn this review, it was emphasized the potential of affinity chromatography in the RNA \n\npurification. As discussed above, in the RNA affinity tags-based chromatography, different \n\ntags are introduced into RNA molecules and since they need to be removed before further \n\nRNA application, conformational changes can be induced in the target RNAs. In general, these \n\nmethods are mostly time-consuming, expensive, tedious and the usage of synthetic RNAs also \n\nrepresents a limitation. Thus, there is still an urgent need for high-selectivity, -specificity, -\n\ncapacity, -reliability and \u2013throughput purification processes, to obtain high quantities of \n\nncRNAs with the demand quality. \n\nFrom our point of view, amino acid-based affinity chromatography emerges as a particularly \n\npromising approach for RNA purification, once it combines the selectivity of a naturally \n\noccurring biological interaction with the simplicity of RNA molecule. Thus, in order to achieve \n\nthe maximum resolution and selectivity between the target RNAs and other host sRNA \n\nspecies, it should be used an affinity support that relies on the same biological interactions \n\nthat are established within the cell, i.e., by using immobilized amino acids, its derivates, \n\npeptides or complementary nucleotide sequences to the target RNAs, as specific ligands. The \n\nnucleotide bases complementarity can also be effectively used for ncRNAs trapping onto the \n\ncolumn which facilitates their separation. Indeed, since synthetic oligonucleotides can be \n\ncovalently bound to chromatographic matrices, ncRNAs can be easily captured when the \n\nappropriated oligonucleotides is attached to the matrix. Therefore, these new affinity \n\nprotocols for miRNA isolation can offer advantages over other less-selective and time-\n\nconsuming multistep procedures and can improve process economics. Moreover, some \n\nimprovements over other chromatographic techniques are expected because RNA recovery \n\ncan be achieved under mild elution conditions, rather than using organic or toxic compounds, \n\nand the use of enzymes is not necessary. In addition, exploiting the specific and natural \n\naffinity interactions between miRNA and the amino acids/peptides/sequences of nucleotides, \n\nit is not necessary to modify the recombinant ncRNA in order to bind it to the matrix. Indeed, \n\nit is expected that this strategy will allow the recovery of RNAs under their native state and \n\nwith high integrity, efficiency and purity level. Furthermore, coupling an affinity based \n\nbioseparation methodology to its recombinant biosynthesis onto prokaryotic hosts represents \n\nan interesting integrated strategy that can be used for ncRNA biosynthesis and purification for \n\nfurther medical or biotechnological applications without the need of using in vitro transcribed \n\nRNAs. Actually, there are several tools available with some success for producing a large \n\n\n\n \n\n 90 \n\nvariety of recombinant RNA using Escherichia coli as a host, including cloning vectors and \n\nfusion tags (RNA is masked within a stable RNA scaffold, such as tRNA fusions and 5S \n\nribosomal RNA) [14,105]. In order to further develop a therapeutic product based on this \n\napproach, the ncRNAs must possess unquestionable biocompatibility features for the potential \n\napplication in future studies in several RNA research fields, namely in RNA structural and \n\nfunctional studies as well as for application in medical therapies. \n\n \n\n6.

However, the presence of contaminants \n\nin these synthesized formulations can lead to non-targeted gene silencing, frequently \n\nassociated with a decrease in therapeutic effectiveness and can still restrict the \n\nimplementation of these oligoribonucleotides onto pre-clinical and clinical applications. In \n\naddition, these current techniques present various limitations in the preparation, isolation \n\nand purification of microRNAs, namely by the use of chemical solvents and denaturing \n\nconditions.  \n\nThus, the global aim of this work is the development and establishment of an innovative \n\nbiotechnological platform for the biosynthesis, recovery and purification of the recombinant \n\nhuman pre-miR-29b, to be delivered to neuronal cells using suitable non-viral delivery \n\nsystems, in order to assure a more effective biological effect in the selective silencing of \n\nendogenous pathways involved in the insurgence and progression of the Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \n\nIn particular, this work intends to explore pre-miR-29b as a novel biopharmaceutical to \n\ndecrease the APP, BACE1 and A? expression levels, which could represent a significant \n\nadvance in terms of treatment of AD. With this work, it is believed that the integrative \n\napproach of extracellular production, using Rhodovulum sulfidophilum host, and affinity-\n\nbased purification will enable the preparation of the target pre-miRNA with high efficiency, \n\nselectivity, throughput, purity, integrity and biological activity, to be applied in RNA research \n\nor RNA therapeutic areas. The high gain in this field is the possibility to use these \n\nmethodologies for the preparation of other ncRNAs, proving the wideness application of the \n\ntechnology, which may have a great impact on industry, improving workload, process time \n\nand economics. \n\nTo accomplish the main scope of this thesis, the experimental work will be developed \n\nconcerning the following tasks: \n\n \n\n1. Cloning the human pre-miR-29b sequence in a prokaryotic expression vector, pBHSR1-\n\nRM and transformation of the Rhodovulum sulfidophilum DSM 1374 host. Development \n\nand establishment of the innovative biosynthesis strategy of extracellular pre-miR-29b, \n\ntesting different growth conditions. Characterization of the intra and extracellular pre-\n\nmiR-29b production. \n\n2.

Study of the ability of amino acids-based affinity supports, such as lysine-agarose, \n\narginine-agarose and agmatine monolith, in the specific recognition of the intracellular \n\npre-miR-29b. The adequate binding/elution conditions will result from the \n\nmanipulation of temperature, flow rate and buffer composition (pH, ionic strength, \n\ntype of salt and presence of competitive agents). These studies will allow the \n\nimplementation of new methodologies for miRNA purification. \n\n \n\n4. Development and characterization of non-viral delivery systems composed by \n\nbiodegradable polymers, for human pre-miR-29b protection and stabilization, allowing \n\ntheir sustained delivery to the cells. It will be also performed the functionalization of \n\nthese delivery systems with specific ligands, to be recognized by cell surface receptors \n\nof Blood-Brain Barrier, and mediate the delivery of pre-miR-29b to the target cells. \n\n \n\n5.

In a first stage, the optimal transformation conditions (0.1 \u00b5g of \n\nplasmid DNA, with a heat-shock of 2 min at 35\u00baC) were established, in order to transfer the \n\npre-miR-29b encoding plasmid to Rhodovulum sulfidophilum host. Furthermore, the \n\nextracellular recovery of this RNA product from the culture medium was greatly improved, \n\nachieving quantities that are compatible with the majority of applications, namely for in vitro \n\nor in vivo studies. Using this system, the extracellular human pre-miR-29b concentration was \n\napproximately 182 \u00b5g/L, after 40 h of bacterial growth, and the total intracellular pre-miR-\n\n29b was of about 358 ?g/L, at 32 h. At the end of the fermentation it was verified that almost \n\n87% of cells were viable, indicating that cell lysis is minimized and that the extracellular \n\nmedium is not highly contaminated with the host intracellular RNases and endotoxins, which \n\nis a critical parameter to guarantee the miRNA integrity. These findings demonstrate that \n\npre-miRNAs can be produced by recombinant RNA technology, offering novel clues for the \n\nproduction of natural pre-miRNA agents for functional studies and RNAi-based therapeutics. \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nExtracellular production; Recombinant human pre-miR-29b; Rhodovulum sulfidophilum; RNAi \n\ntechnology; Transformation efficiency \n\n\n\n \n\n 112 \n\n\n\n \n\n 113 \n\nIntroduction  \n\nIn the last couple of decades, RNA interference (RNAi)-based technology has become a novel \n\ntool for regulating gene expression in eukaryotic cells, since many small RNAs (sRNAs) act as \n\nregulators of messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and have shown great potential for \n\ntherapeutic knockdown of disease-causing genes (Fire et al. 1998; Ramachandran and \n\nIgnacimuthu 2013). This discovery led to the expectation that RNA molecules, such as \n\nribozymes, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) \n\nand long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) will be major classes of new therapeutic molecules in the \n\nnear future (Dogini et al. 2014; Gomes et al. 2013). Amongst RNAi-based therapeutics, \n\nmiRNAs have recently gained much attention, being investigated as potential drug candidates \n\nfor application in several disease scenarios that currently remain very challenging and \n\ndifficult to overcome (Sullenger and Gilboa 2002). In particular, their therapeutic potential \n\ncan be exploited in gene expression regulation at post-transcriptional level, through \n\ndegradation/de-adenylation of selected target mRNAs, translational repression or both \n\nmechanisms (Nilsen 2007). Briefly, miRNAs mediate post-transcriptional regulation through a \n\nsequential process involving a miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA) and, subsequently, a mature \n\nmiRNA that is incorporated into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to regulate the mRNA \n\ntranslation. Due to the rapidly growing demand for these biopharmaceuticals, various \n\nstrategies are currently being pursued to improve production in order to achieve higher \n\nproduct titers while maintaining maximal product quality (Ponchon and Dardel 2007; Ponchon \n\nand Dardel 2011). Furthermore, economically efficient methods for large-scale production are \n\nalso required. \n\nCurrently, miRNAs-mediated gene silencing is mainly performed through chemically \n\nsynthesized RNAs, by phosphoamidite chemistry, normally used for the generation of short \n\noligoribonucleotides (Ling et al. 2013). In addition to chemical synthesis, RNAs can also be \n\nobtained by enzymatic synthesis, for example longer RNAs can be produced by in vitro \n\ntranscription using T7 RNA polymerase (Beckert and Masquida 2011; Milligan et al. 1987). \n\nAlthough these methods can be very efficient in producing miRNA, in general, several \n\npurification protocols to remove the contaminants (impurities of plasmid DNA template, \n\nenzymes, nucleotides, chemicals, salts or buffers, which are indispensable for in vitro \n\ntranscription or chemical synthesis of RNAs) have to be employed (Martins et al. 2014; \n\nMilligan et al. 1987). The presence of these impurities can lead to non-targeted gene \n\nsilencing, what is commonly associated with a decrease in therapeutic effectiveness and still \n\nrestrict the implementation of these RNAs onto pre-clinical or clinical trials. On the other \n\nhand, the purification methods usually employed can cause degradation of RNA molecules due \n\nto the requirement of toxic solvents and the use of denaturing conditions (Martins et al. \n\n2014). MiRNA-based therapeutic applications can also be performed via the endogenous \n\nexpression of miRNAs encoded by viral vectors or plasmids in eukaryotic cells. However, this \n\n\n\n \n\n 114 \n\nalternative approach is generally less efficient because it is necessary to transcribe the DNA \n\nto miRNA precursors (Chen et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2011; Li et al. 2014; Ponchon and Dardel \n\n2007; Ponchon and Dardel 2011). Considering the potential therapeutic applications and the \n\nmandatory global distribution of these novel therapeutics, it is crucial to develop efficient \n\nmethods for their preparation. One of the most promising strategies might be the use of \n\nrecombinant microorganisms to produce the target biomolecules. This approach can reduce \n\nthe costs and remains highly efficient.  \n\nAt present, few strategies have emerged to produce stable RNAs, namely a circular RNA \n\naptamer (Umekage and Kikuchi 2009), a \u201ctRNA scaffold\u201d (Ponchon and Dardel 2007) and hsa-\n\nmir-27b, using recombinant bacteria, mainly Escherichia coli (E. coli) as preferential host (Li \n\net al. 2014). Occasionally, modifications of RNA products are required to efficiently obtain \n\nthe product, such as the addition of flanking sequences in the case of tRNA scaffold, which \n\nare then removed by ribonuclease (RNase) H treatment, making the process unsuitable for \n\nindustrial RNA drug production (Ponchon and Dardel 2007). Moreover, in what concerns to the \n\nuse of E. coli for RNA production, it demands the completion of cell lysis and extraction of \n\nnucleic acids, which can be laborious and time-consuming due to the number and complexity \n\nof the processing steps (Wassarman et al. 1999). Along with the aforementioned \n\ndisadvantages, another major issue associated with the cell lysis is the release of endotoxins, \n\nwhich can lead to the contamination of the target RNA sample, and, in a last analysis, \n\nproduce symptoms of toxic shock syndrome if present in sufficient quantities in vivo (Wei et \n\nal. 2007). In addition, as E. coli expresses several endonucleases, it can be difficult to \n\nmaintain the integrity of the target RNA, being always necessary to establish methods to \n\navoid its degradation.  \n\nVery recently, the marine phototrophic bacterium Rhodovulum sulfidophilum (R. \n\nsulfidophilum) was also described as an attractive host for the recombinant production of an \n\nartificial RNA model (streptavidin RNA aptamer) (Suzuki et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2011) and \n\nshRNAs (Nagao et al. 2014). In particular, this bacterium is non-pathogenic and presents \n\nseveral advantages over E. coli, such as the capacity of secretion of nucleic acids directly to \n\nthe culture medium and the absence of detectable host RNases in the extracellular medium \n\n(Suzuki et al. 2009a; Ando et al. 2004; Ando et al. 2006). The endogenous RNAs released by \n\nR. sulfidophilum to the extracellular medium are mainly nonaminoacylated fully mature \n\ntransfer RNAs (tRNAs) and fragments of 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) (Ando et al. \n\n2006; Suzuki et al. 2009b). In fact, previous works described that both recombinant RNAs \n\n(streptavidin RNA aptamer and shRNAs) produced in R. sulfidophilum were found not only \n\ninside the cells but also in the culture medium (Nagao et al. 2014; Suzuki et al. 2010; Suzuki \n\net al. 2011). \n\nIn the present study, for the first time, an alternative strategy for the recombinant \n\nbiosynthesis and extracellular recovery of biologically active human pre-miR-29b (hsa-pre-\n\n\n\n \n\n 115 \n\nmir-29b) is proposed. The pre-miR-29 target was chosen because it belongs to one of the most \n\ninteresting miRNA families in humans to date, once this miRNA is involved in several \n\nregulatory pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases and also presenting tumor-\n\nsuppressing and immune-modulating properties (Alvarez-Garcia and Miska 2005; Du and \n\nPertsemlidis 2011; Hebert et al. 2008; Nelson et al. 2008). It is expected that this strategy \n\ncan be highly advantageous regarding the RNA product safety, since it will not stimulate \n\ninnate immunity, as the secreted miRNAs will be devoid of main bacterial associated \n\nimpurities. Moreover, after the application of an appropriated purification flowsheet (Fig. 1), \n\nthe isolation and purification of the target pre-miRNA will be easier and successful. The \n\nrecovery of miRNAs from the fermentation broth will be performed using membrane filtration \n\nor concentration techniques. In fact, the application of this approach can be a promising \n\ntechnology since it suppresses the use of salts and solvents typically used in conventional RNA \n\nisolation processes. Overall, an economical and fast method for the production of functional \n\nRNA molecules with clinical-grade quality and biological activity is described, which can be \n\napplied in basic studies or in therapeutic strategies based on RNAi technology. From this \n\nstand point, it seems clear that the establishment of a robust and reliable miRNA \n\nextracellular production technology can indeed unlock the possibility of further developing \n\neffective therapeutic strategies that rely on the intrinsic gene silencing capacity of these \n\noligonucleotides, presenting major advantages over the currently existing practices.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - Schematics of the integrative platform that allows the biosynthesis and \n\nextracellular recovery of the recombinant hsa-pre-miR-29b. \n\n\n\n \n\n 116 \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\nMaterials and Chemicals \n\nRestriction enzymes including EcoRI, EcoT22I, AatI and StuI were purchased from Thermo \n\nFisher Scientific Inc. (Waltham, MA) and XbaI was purchased from New England BioLabs \n\n(Ipswich, MA). T4 DNA ligase and pGEM-T easy vector were used as recommended by the \n\nmanufactures (Promega). DreamTaq DNA polymerase was purchased from Fermentas (Beijing, \n\nChina). Hyper Ladder I (Bioline, London, UK) was used as DNA molecular weight marker. \n\nPrimers were synthesized by StabVida (Caparica, Lisbon). The sequence of pre-miRNA was \n\nobtained from the miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org/index.shtml).  \n\nBacterial strains and growth conditions \n\nThe R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374 strain (BCCM/LMG, Belgium) modified with plasmid pBHSR1-\n\nRM containing the sequence of human pre-miR-29b was used in this study for pre-miR-29b \n\nproduction. One Shot\u00ae TOP10 Chemically Competent E. coli (Invitrogen) was used for the \n\npropagation of the recombinant plasmid DNA (pDNA). The pGEM-T easy vector was applied for \n\nDNA manipulations and the plasmid pBHSR1-RM (a generous gift from Dr. Yo Kikuchi) was used \n\nas the expression vector (Nagao et al. 2014; Suzuki et al. 2011). E. coli TOP10 was grown in \n\nLuria-Bertani (LB) medium (10.0 g/L tryptone, 5.0 g/L yeast extract and 5.0 g/L sodium \n\nchloride (NaCl)) and LB-Agar. In the preliminary results, R. sulfidophilum was tested in \n\nNutrient Agar (g per liter of deionized water: beef extract, 1.5; yeast extract, 1.5; peptidic \n\ndigest of animal tissue, 5.0; NaCl, 5.0 and agar, 15.0), Tryptone Soya Agar (g per liter of \n\ndeionized water: casein peptone (pancreatic), 15.0; soya peptone, 5.0; NaCl, 5.0 and agar, \n\n15.0) and Mueller Hinton Agar (g per liter of deionized water: beef, dehydrated infusion from, \n\n30.0; casein hydrolysate, 17.5; starch, 1.5 and agar 17.0). R. sulfidophilum cells were \n\ncultivated in a semi-defined medium, developed in this work, containing (per L of water) \n\ntryptone, 10.0 g; polypeptone, 5.0 g; yeast extract, 0.5 g; NaCl, 30.0 g; K2HPO4, 4.0 g; \n\nKH2PO4, 1.0 g; glucose, 50.0 g; MgSO4.7H2O, 0.2 g; CaCl2.2H2O, 0.05 g; (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g and 1 \n\nmL of trace elements solution (TES). The TES composition was as follows: (5.56 g/L \n\nFeSO4.7H2O, 3.96 g/L MnCl2.4H2O, 5.62 g/L CoSO4.7H2O, 0.34 g/L CuCl2.2H2O, 0.58 g/L \n\nZnSO4.7H2O, 0.6 g/L H3BO3, 0.04 g/L NiCl2.6H2O and 0.06 g/L Na2MoO4.2H2O in 0.5 N HCl) (Kim \n\net al. 2000; Silva et al. 2009). For solid media, the MT medium was used (10.0 g/L glucose, \n\n10.0 g/L peptone, 5.0 g/L yeast extract, 20.0 g/L NaCl, 10.0 mg/L FeSO4.7H2O, 10.0 mg/L \n\nMnSO4.4H2O, 1.0 mg/L ZnSO4.7H2O, 4.1 g/L MgCl2 and 15.0 g/L agar) (Pedro et al. 2011). The \n\nmedium pH was adjusted to 7.0, with 0.1 M NaOH before autoclaving. When appropriated, \n\nmedia were supplemented with the following antibiotics: for E. coli, ampicillin and \n\nkanamycin were used with final concentrations of 100 and 20 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, while for \n\nR. sulfidophilum, kanamycin was used at a concentration of 30 \u00b5g/mL. Unless otherwise \n\nstated, E. coli cells were grown at 37\u00baC and R. sulfidophilum growth was carried out at 30\u00baC \n\nunder dark-aerobic conditions. Cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density \n\n\n\n \n\n 117 \n\n(OD) of the culture medium at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600). Posteriorly, cells were \n\nrecovered by centrifugation and stored at -20\u00baC.  \n\nConstruction of pBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-29b plasmid \n\nUsing the plasmid pBHSR1-RM as template (Suzuki et al. 2011), a DNA fragment containing the \n\nrrn promoter, the streptavidin RNA aptamer sequence with flanker ribozyme sequences and \n\npuf terminator region was amplified by PCR. The sequence primers pBHSR1_Fw and \n\npBHSR1_Rv are shown in Table S1, Supporting Information. The amplified DNA fragment of the \n\npBHSR1-RM was purified and cloned into pGEM-T easy vector. Then, the vector was digested \n\nwith StuI and XbaI, releasing a fragment containing the streptavidin RNA aptamer sequence \n\nwith flanker ribozyme sequences, and the pGEM-T easy vector was purified from agarose gel \n\nwith NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (Macherey-Nagel). Using the pBHSR1-RM plasmid as \n\ntemplate in a PCR reaction, specific primers (pBHSR1-RM_StuI_premiR_511Fw and pBHSR1-\n\nRM_XbaI820Rv) flanking the second sequence of hammer head ribozyme and the puf \n\nterminator region were used to insert and amplify the pre-miR-29b sequence, which was \n\ndigested by StuI and XbaI and cloned into pGEM-T easy vector previously digested. The StuI \n\nand XbaI sites in the primers are underlined and the pre-miR-29b sequence is a bold \n\n(Supporting Information, Table S1). In order to obtain the sequence of pre-miR-29b flanked by \n\nhammer ribozymes and puf terminator region, the pGEM-T easy vector was digested with \n\nEcoRI and XbaI restriction enzymes and cloned into pBHSR-RM previously digested with the \n\nsame restriction enzymes. After E. coli TOP10 transformation with the vector, several \n\ncolonies were screened by PCR for the presence of the recombinant plasmid pBHSR1-RM \n\ncontaining the pre-miR-29b sequence, being designated by pBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-29b \n\n(Supporting Information, Fig. S1). Therefore, some colonies were inoculated in LB medium \n\nand grown at 37\u00baC and 250 rpm, overnight. From these bacterial cultures, the plasmid \n\npBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-29b was isolated and purified using the NZYMiniprep Kit (NZYtech, \n\nLisbon, Portugal) and digested with EcoT22I and AatI to confirm the presence of the pre-miR-\n\n29b sequence. Plasmid DNA concentrations were determined by NanoPhotometer (Implen) \n\nand sequenced in order to confirm the identity and orientation of the amplicon.  \n\nPreparation and Transformation of competent Rhodovulum sulfidophilum cells \n\nGrowth of R. sulfidophilum strain was carried out in 500 mL shake flasks containing 100 mL of \n\nsemi-defined medium, in a rotary shaker at 30\u00baC and 250 rpm under aerobic-dark conditions, \n\nuntil the cell suspension reached an OD600 of 0.4 and 0.8. These cells were used to prepare \n\ncompetent cells for heat shock method. For this purpose, 50 mL aliquots of cell suspension \n\nwere centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00baC. The medium was decanted from the cell \n\npellets and each one was ressuspended in 12.5 mL of ice-cold 100 mM MgCl2. The cells were \n\nrecovered again at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00baC and ressuspended in 50 mL of ice-cold 100 mM \n\nCaCl2. The cell suspension was maintained on ice for at least 20-30 min. After this, the \n\nbacterial culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4\u00baC and the pellet was \n\n\n\n \n\n 118 \n\nressuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold 85 mM CaCl2 containing ice-cold 15% (w/v) glycerol for each \n\n50 mL of original culture. Then, the plasmid pBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-29b was introduced into R. \n\nsulfidophilum cells by the method of heat shock. To this end, different quantities of plasmid \n\npBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-29b (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 \u00b5g) were immediately added to 0.1 mL of \n\ncompetent cells (the suspension was left on ice for 10 min), and the heat shock was \n\nperformed at different temperatures (35 and 42\u00baC) and incubation periods (1 and 2 min), in \n\norder to determine the best conditions. After the heat shock, 200 \u00b5L of semi-defined medium \n\nwas added to the transformation mixture and it was incubated at 30\u00baC, 250 rpm for 2 h under \n\naerobic-dark conditions to allow the expression of antibiotic resistance gene. The culture was \n\nthen plated on MT agar plates with kanamycin and incubated aerobically at 30\u00baC for at least 2 \n\ndays until the appearance of colonies. For each different condition tested, three independent \n\nfermentation runs were performed.  \n\nProduction of pre-miR-29b in Rhodovulum sulfidophilum \n\nUnless otherwise stated, recombinant pre-miR-29b biosynthesis was carried out according to \n\nthe following protocol. Cells containing the expression construct were grown at 30\u00baC in MT \n\nplates containing kanamycin. Then, colonies were used to inoculate 100 mL of the semi-\n\ndefined medium, on 500 mL shake flasks. Cells were grown at 30\u00baC and 250 rpm under dark-\n\naerobic conditions, until the OD600 typically reached 2.6. Subsequently, in order to start the \n\nfermentation with an initial OD600 of 0.3, an aliquot of the pre-fermentation medium was \n\nadded to 500 mL shake flasks to a total volume of 100 mL. The fermentations were carried \n\nout during 72 h. Finally, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (1500 g, 10 min, 4\u00baC) and \n\nstored at -20\u00baC until use. \n\nIsolation of intracellular and extracellular human pre-miR-29b \n\nThe isolation of extracellular nucleic acids was based on the method described by Martins and \n\nco-workers (2010) with some modifications (Martins et al. 2010). Cultivated cells of R. \n\nsulfidophilum DSM 1374 were recovered by centrifugation at 10000 g for 10 min at 4\u00baC, and \n\nthe supernatant was carefully transferred to an autoclaved tube. The nucleic acids fraction of \n\nthe supernatant was precipitated by adding 3 volumes of 100% ethanol, 1/20th of 3 M sodium \n\nacetate (pH 5.0) and 20 \u00b5L of glycogen (30 \u00b5g/mL). After incubation overnight, nucleic acids \n\nwere recovered by centrifugation at 10000 g for 10 min at 4\u00baC and washed with 75% ethanol. \n\nThe nucleic acids pellets were air-dried for 10 min at room temperature and solubilized in \n\n0.05% DEPC-treated water and incubated with DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). For \n\nthe intracellular RNAs recovery, the total RNA was extracted from the collected cells using \n\nTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and chloroform, according to the protocol \n\nprovided by the manufacturer. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was transferred to \n\nnew tubes, and the RNA was precipitated with isopropanol and washed with 75% of ethanol. \n\nThe air-dried total RNA pellet was solubilized in 0.05% DEPC-treated water.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 119 \n\nAssessment of recombinant human pre-miR-29b production \n\nRNA samples were quantified and evaluated regarding their purity (260/280 nm ratio) using a \n\nNANOPhotometer. The integrity and quality of RNA was assessed by agarose gel \n\nelectrophoresis. A total of 1 \u00b5g of RNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA \n\n(cDNA) in 20 \u00b5L final volume using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher \n\nScientific Inc.), according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For quantitative \n\nanalysis, the amount of pre-miR-29b produced was determined by reverse transcription-\n\nquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) through amplification of cDNA \n\nusing a specific probe (Roche, Table 1) on a CFX Connect\u2122 Real-Time PCR Detection System \n\nfrom BioRad. RT-qPCR efficiencies were calculated from the given slopes with MyIQ 2.0 \n\nsoftware (BioRad). The calibration curve to determine the pre-miR-29b concentration was \n\nconstructed by serial dilutions of the pre-miR-29b synthetic sample (Stabvida) in the range of \n\n0.00001 to 0.01 pmol/\u00b5L. The quantification of the pre-miR-29b expression was calculated by \n\napplying the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method. A list of primers used for RT-qPCR \n\nanalysis can be seen in Table 1. RT-qPCRs were performed in a 20 ?L mixture containing 5 ?L \n\ncDNA, 400 nM Fw and Rv primers (Roche), 1\u00d7 FastStart TaqMan\u00ae Probe Master (Roche), 200 nM \n\nof UPL Probe (Roche, Table S1, Supporting Information) and water, under the following \n\nconditions: 95\u00baC for 10 min for initial denaturation followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00baC for 10 s, \n\n60\u00baC for 30 s and 72\u00baC for 15 s. Due to the small space between the primers it is only possible \n\nto design a probe with a sufficient melting temperature if few Locked Nucleic Acid (LNA) \n\nbases are added into the probes sequence. Each sample was run in triplicate, and CT values \n\nwere averaged from the triplicates. The final data were averaged from three independent \n\nexperiments. \n\nProtein analysis \n\nProtein content in each sample was measured by the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo \n\nFisher Scientific Inc.), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Reducing sodium dodecyl \n\nsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed, according to the \n\nmethod of Laemmli on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Laemmli 1970). Samples were denatured by \n\nthe addition of loading dye followed by incubation at 95\u00baC for 10 min. Gel was stained by \n\nBlueSafe (NZYtech, Lisbon, Portugal). Low molecular weight protein marker (NZYtech, Lisbon, \n\nPortugal) was used as a molecular weight standard. \n\nGenomic DNA quantification \n\nThe concentration of genomic DNA (gDNA) was obtained by real-time qPCR in an iQ5 \n\nMulticolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (BioRad). The primers used in these experiments \n\nwere 5\u2019-ACACGGTCCAGAACTCCTACG-3\u2019 (forward) and 5\u2019-\n\nCCGGTGCTTCTTCTGCGGGTAACGTCA-3\u2019 (reverse) for the amplification of a 181 bp fragment \n\nof the 16S rRNA gene. PCR amplicons were quantified by following changes in fluorescence of \n\nthe DNA binding dye Maxima\u00ae SYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher \n\n\n\n \n\n 120 \n\nScientific Inc.). The calibration curve to achieve the gDNA concentration was constructed by \n\nserial dilutions of the R. sulfidophilum gDNA sample (purified with the Wizard\u00ae Genomic DNA \n\nPurification kit, Promega) in the range of 0.005 to 50 ng/mL. Each sample was run in \n\ntriplicate, and CT values were averaged from the triplicate. The final data were averaged \n\nfrom three independent experiments. \n\nCell viability \n\nAt different time points of the culture growth, the cellular cytotoxicity was assessed by the in \n\nvitro toxicology assay kit using the resazurin dye (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), \n\nconducted according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated at 37\u00baC \n\nduring 2 h with a resazurin dye solution. Following incubation, the resulting pink product was \n\ntransferred to a 96-well black clear bottom fluorescence plates (Corning\u00ae Costar\u00ae) and \n\nquantified in a spectrofluorometer (Spectramax Gemini XS, Molecular Devices LLC, US), using \n\nan excitation/emission wavelength of ?ex = 560 nm and ?em = 590 nm. As a positive control for \n\ncytotoxicity, death cells were used after incubation at 75\u00baC during 30 min, while a blank \n\nanalysis was performed with complete medium without cells. Each value represents the mean \n\nof three independent experiments. \n\n\n\n \n\n 121 \n\nResults  \n\npBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-29b expression vector construction \n\nHsa-pre-miR-29b was already identified as a target in several diseases, and its sequence was \n\nselected in the miRBase, which is the official repository of miRNAs. In this study, the \n\nproduction of the pre-miRNA instead of the mature miRNA is described, since the recognition \n\nand processing in the cell are more efficient. Moreover, its structural characteristics, \n\nspecifically the single chain with ~80 nucleotides of which some are unpaired in the \n\n3\u2019overhang, will possibly facilitate the purification of the target miRNAs (Tsutsumi et al. \n\n2011). The hsa-pre-miR-29b sequence was amplified by PCR using specific primers (Supporting \n\nInformation, Table S1) containing two restrictions sites for StuI and XbaI and cloned into the \n\nplasmid pBHSR1-RM, previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. For the \n\nconstruction of pBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-29b, the target sequence was cloned in the pBHSR1-RM \n\nvector, as it presents two self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme sequences flanking the target \n\npre-miRNA, allowing its release. As can be observed in Figure S1A, Supporting Information, \n\nthe electrophoretic analysis of the PCR products obtained from the amplification with the \n\nspecific primers for hsa-pre-miR-29b shows one band corresponding to the size of the gene of \n\ninterest cloned into pBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-29b. The recombinant plasmid pBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-\n\n29b was also digested with restriction enzymes, namely EcoT22I and AatI, to confirm the \n\npresence of the cloned hsa-pre-miR-29b sequence. In this electrophoresis, one band \n\ncorresponding to the size of the gene of interest it is also visible (Supporting Information, Fig. \n\nS1B). In addition, the vector was sequenced to confirm the identity and orientation of the \n\ntarget gene produced, being identified as the hsa-pre-miR-29b (Supporting Information, Fig. \n\nS1C). After confirming that the isolated positive clone contained the hsa-pre-miR-29b, it was \n\nintroduced into freshly made competent R. sulfidophilum cells by heat shock. Thus, in this \n\nwork, the recombinant hsa-pre-miR-29b was produced in a genetically modified organism, R. \n\nsulfidophilum DSM 1374, harboring the plasmid pBHSR1-RM-pre-miR-29b. \n\nImprovement of Rhodovulum sulfidophilum transformation conditions \n\nBacterial transformation is of utmost importance in all aspects of genetic engineering. A small \n\nnumber of chemical and physical methods have been established to introduce exogenous DNA \n\ninto R. sulfidophilum cells, including heat shock with polyethylene glycol 6000 and \n\nconjugation with the mobilizing strain E. coli S17-1 (Donohue and Kaplan 1991; Nagao et al. \n\n2014; Suzuki et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2011). Although these two methods have been tested \n\nfor R. sulfidophilum transformation, so far the Rhodovulum genus has not been characterized \n\nconcerning its optimal transformation conditions. In laboratory, the most widely used \n\nmethods for artificial bacterial transformation are based on the treatment of the cells with \n\nCaCl2 or, alternatively, the electroporation (Donohue and Kaplan 1991). Therefore, in this \n\nstudy, an effective method using CaCl2 for the preparation of competent R. sulfidophilum \n\ncells it is described. As it is known, there are several factors that affect the bacterial \n\n\n\n \n\n 122 \n\ntransformation efficiency, namely the incubation time (1 and 2 min) of bacteria with DNA, \n\nthe plasmid DNA concentration (0.1 to 5 \u00b5g/mL) used in the transformation mixture, the \n\ntemperature of incubation (35 and 42\u00baC), and growth phase (OD=0.4 and 0.8). To estimate \n\nthe effect of the growth phase on the transformation efficiency, R. sulfidophilum cells \n\ncultured to mid-lag (OD=0.4) and late-lag (OD=0.8) phases were subjected to heat shock. As \n\ndepicted in Figure 2, when the cells were collected in the mid-lag phase for preparation of \n\ncompetent cells, higher transformation efficiencies were obtained, in comparison to that \n\nachieved with the cells collected in late-lag phase. Therefore, as the transformation \n\nefficiency of mid-lag recovered bacteria are higher than late-lag phase, this was the condition \n\nused for the preparation of competent R. sulfidophilum cells. The effect of the plasmid \n\nconcentration was also evaluated, since it also influences the process transformation \n\nefficiency. Thus, different plasmid DNA amounts (from 0.1 up to 5 \u00b5g/mL) were employed and \n\nthe transformation efficiency was determined, as represented in Figure 2. In fact, it is \n\npossible to observe that the optimum amount of plasmid DNA was 0.1 \u00b5g, since it corresponds \n\nto the higher transformation efficiency achieved, 8.22x103 transformants/\u00b5g plasmid (Fig. \n\n2A). When the plasmid DNA was increased to 5 \u00b5g, the transformation efficiency drastically \n\ndecreased, because this concentration can be toxic for the bacteria. In general, from all the \n\nconditions tested, the highest R. sulfidophilum transformation efficiency was obtained using \n\nthe following conditions: 0.1 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA, with a heat-shock of 2 min at 35\u00baC (Fig. 2). \n\nThe increase in temperature from 35 to 42\u00baC also played an important role in the \n\ntransformation efficiency resulting in a decrease of the transformation efficiency from \n\n8.22x103 to 3.85x103 transformants/\u00b5g plasmid (Fig. 2B).  \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Effects of growth phase, time incubation, amount of plasmid DNA (A) at 35\u00baC and \n\n(B) at 42\u00baC on the transformation efficiency of R. sulfidophilum cells. Data shown are mean \u00b1 \n\ns.d. from triplicate runs. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 123 \n\nThe effect of temperature and sodium chloride concentration on Rhodovulum \n\nsulfidophilum growth \n\nIn general, the media formulation for culturing R. sulfidophilum cells seems to require \n\nspecific components for the development of a sustainable and successfully upstream stage. \n\nInitially, R. sulfidophilum growth was tested in aerobic conditions, using different solid \n\nculture media commonly applied for bacterial growth, namely Nutrient Agar, Tryptone Soya \n\nAgar and Mueller Hinton Agar (see Materials and Methods section). R. sulfidophilum growth \n\nwas only detected with Nutrient Agar medium, indicating that specific components such as \n\nsodium chloride and yeast extract are required for R. sulfidophilum growth and recombinant \n\nhsa-pre-miR-29b biosynthesis (data not shown). Then, in order to define the optimum \n\nconditions for bacterial growth and over-expression of the target RNA, several experiments \n\nvarying the temperature (25 and 30\u00baC) and sodium chloride concentration (10, 20, 30 and 50 \n\ng/L), were carried out, under aerobic conditions. In what concerns to the effect of sodium \n\nchloride concentration using Nutrient Broth medium, our results demonstrated that the \n\nbacteria hardly grow with 10 g/L NaCl (Fig. 3A), highlighting the requirement of a higher salt \n\nconcentration for R. sulfidophilum growth. On the other hand, using sodium chloride \n\nconcentrations of 20, 30 and 50 g/L, higher growth rates were achieved. In general, the ideal \n\nsodium chloride concentration for higher R. sulfidophilum growth was 30 g/L NaCl (Fig. 3A).  \n\nAlthough the optimized concentration of sodium chloride improved the R. sulfidophilum \n\ngrowth profile, under aerobic conditions, its growth was not yet optimal, indicating that \n\nother compounds such as glucose or polypeptone can be required. Thus, several experiments \n\nwere performed and the composition of the semi-defined medium adapted from Sankhla and \n\nco-workers (Sankhla et al. 2010) was evaluated for maximizing R. sulfidophilum growth rates \n\n(see Materials and Methods section). Considering that the main objective of this work is to \n\nproduce a microRNA, it is important to mention that the yeast extract, one of the minor \n\ncomponents added to the medium, presents RNA traces, which can constitute a contaminant \n\nof the target product. Furthermore, after the optimization of the culture medium, it was also \n\nevaluated the effect of the temperature (25 and 30\u00baC) on R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374 growth \n\nprofile, using the semi-defined medium supplemented with 30 g/L of NaCl under aerobic \n\nconditions. The time course profiles are shown in Figure 3B, where it is possible to observe \n\nthat bacterial growth was slightly lower at 25\u00baC than at 30\u00baC. Furthermore, Figure 3B shows \n\nan initial lag phase of 18 h, followed by a rapid increase in the growth rates at 30\u00baC where \n\n6.86\u00b10.09 units of OD600 was obtained. The temperature selected is within the range of \n\noptimum R. sulfidophilum growth (30 to 35\u00baC) as previously reported by other authors \n\n(Hansen and Veldkamp 1973). In general, the experiments performed with the aim of \n\nunderstanding the effect of temperature and NaCl concentration on the growth profile of DSM \n\n1374 strain demonstrated that the optimal conditions are 30\u00baC in semi-defined medium, pH \n\n6.8 (Fig. 3B). In addition, our results suggest that these conditions enable a shorter \n\ncultivation time and higher optical densities are achieved (Fig. 3B).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 124 \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013 (A) Effect of sodium chloride concentrations (10, 20, 30 and 50 g/L) on growth of \n\nthe photosynthetic bacterium Rhodovulum sulfidophilum DSM 1374 in Nutrient Broth medium \n\nunder aerobic conditions, in the dark. The data are the average of three repeats of duplicate \n\ncultivations. Bars indicate standard deviation. (B) Effect of temperature (25 and 30\u00baC) on \n\ngrowth of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodovulum sulfidophilum DSM 1374. R. \n\nsulfidophilum was cultivated in semi-defined medium supplemented with 30 g/L NaCl under \n\naerobic conditions, in the dark. The data are the average of three repeats of duplicate \n\ncultivations. Bars indicate standard deviation. \n\n \n\nTime course profile of hsa-pre-miR-29b biosynthesis \n\nThe cells transformed with the recombinant plasmid expressing the hsa-pre-miR-29b were \n\ncultivated under aerobic dark conditions, to clarify the relationship between cell growth and \n\nthe production of intra and extracellular nucleic acids. First of all, the presence of pre-miR-\n\n29b inside the cells was confirmed. Therefore, at various time points of the culture, the cells \n\nwere recovered by centrifugation and the total RNA was extracted and collected using the \n\nphenol/chloroform extraction. The concentration of the intracellular total RNA was estimated \n\nby spectrophotometric analysis, measuring the absorbance at 260 and 280 nm. The 260/280 \n\nratio was also determined, which is an indication of the purity of each sample, being \n\nachieved a ratio of 2.0, which is often characteristic of a pure RNA preparation (RE 2005). By \n\nRT-qPCR using a specific probe, the maximum amount of intracellular pre-miR-29b \n\ndetermined was 358.47\u00b15.48 \u00b5g/L of culture, at 32 h of cultivation. On the other hand, to \n\nelucidate the relationship between cell growth and the production of extracellular pre-miR-\n\n29b, the total extracellular nucleic acids were isolated from the culture medium and \n\nanalyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis during different periods of cultivation. Figure 4A \n\nshows that the nucleic acids profile of the clarified precipitates recovered along the R. \n\nsulfidophilum cultivation contained different RNA species and fragments of gDNA. The \n\nanalysis of the electrophoresis (Fig. 4A) revealed the presence of bands with high molecular \n\nweight, corresponding to fragments of gDNA (higher than 10000 bp). The 23S and 16S rRNA \n\n\n\n \n\n 125 \n\nbands are also present, with molecular weights between 750 and 1500 bp. In addition, sRNAs \n\nare present in sharp bands of low molecular weight (about 200 bp). The results show different \n\ncontents of extracellular nucleic acids during bacteria growth (Fig. 4A). In order to identify \n\nand quantify specifically the pre-miR-29, during 72 h of cultivation (until the stationary \n\nphase), the nucleic acids in the culture medium were collected by ethanol precipitation and \n\nthe resulting fraction was treated with DNase I. The cDNA of the RNA fraction was prepared \n\nand subjected to RT-qPCR analysis to detect the pre-miR-29b sequence at various time points \n\nof the bacterial growth (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that in fact the self-processed \n\nprecursor form of the miR-29 (pre-miR-29b) was present in the culture medium. In particular, \n\nit was found that the maximum level of extracellular pre-miR-29b obtained in the present \n\nstudy was 181.64\u00b135.78 \u00b5g/L of culture (Fig. 4B), and the maximum level of production was \n\nobserved at 40 h of cultivation (late log phase).  \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Extracellular production and release of the human pre-miR-29b, gDNA and proteins \n\ninto the culture medium.

(B) The time course of \n\nextracellular production of the hsa-pre-miR-29b from the bacteria harboring pBHSR1-RM-pre-\n\nmiR-29b is shown. The amounts of hsa-pre-miR-29b were measured by quantitative RT-PCR \n\nusing a specific probe, as described in Materials and Methods (see Table S1, Supporting \n\nInformation). Error bars indicate the respective standard deviations which were calculated \n\nfrom the results of three independent experiments. (C) Production of extracellular gDNA and \n\nproteins.

Lane M, protein molecular weight marker. \n\n\n\n \n\n 126 \n\nAs can be seen by Figure 4B, the extracellular pre-miR-29b production increased until 40 h, \n\nafter which a significant decrease in yield was observed. The time course profile obtained is \n\nvery similar to the curve of the streptavidin RNA aptamer production which was published by \n\nSuzuki and collaborators (Nagao et al. 2014; Suzuki et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2011). \n\nDetection of extracellular genomic DNA and proteins \n\nRegarding the potential applicability of this method to obtain recombinant pre-miRNAs, along \n\nwith the time-course profile of the target RNA biosynthesis, it is also important to evaluate \n\nits purity during the fermentation time. Therefore, the levels of gDNA and proteins in the \n\nextracellular medium were evaluated during the fermentation period. As discussed above, the \n\npurity of the sample is commonly evaluated by the 260/280 nm ratio because it is an indirect \n\nmethod to verify the contamination of nucleic acids with proteins. Nevertheless, a more \n\naccurate method was used to verify the protein contamination level. Thus, the protein level \n\nin RNA samples was quantified by the micro-BCA method during the cultivation because \n\ncontaminating protein can be overlooked by spectrophotometric analysis. Figure 4C shows the \n\nresults for protein quantification in the extracellular RNA fraction, resultant from a culture at \n\n30\u00baC, 30 g/L NaCl concentration assay. The findings revealed that the proteins level in the \n\nextracellular medium was high during the first 32 h of cultivation, with a maximum value of \n\n114.65\u00b16.64 \u00b5g/mL at 16h (Fig. 4C). Considering this profile, it is suggested that the initial \n\nproteins content can be associated to the presence of complex components in the medium, \n\nwhich can contain residual proteins. Therefore, the proteins of the medium (without bacterial \n\ninoculation) were also quantified using the BCA method and a concentration of 93.04\u00b11.43 \n\n\u00b5g/mL was obtained. As the fermentation time increases, the medium components start to be \n\nmetabolized by the bacterium and the contribution of the medium to the global protein \n\ncontent slows down. In addition, to identify the profile of the proteins quantified by BCA \n\nassay, a SDS-PAGE electrophoresis was also performed (Fig. 4D). These results obtained with \n\nSDS-PAGE are in agreement with the results obtained with BCA assay because in the lanes \n\ncorresponding to 24 h of cultivation, there are no protein bands, indicating that the secretion \n\nof proteins by the bacteria is not significant at this point (Fig. 4D). However, it is possible to \n\nvisualize faint protein bands with molecular weights between 48 and 63 KDa in the samples \n\nobtained after 32 h of growth, where the secretion starts to be more significant (Fig. 4D). The \n\ntime course profile of extracellular gDNA production and secretion to the culture medium at \n\nvarious time points in culture was also determined by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 4C). \n\nThe production of extracellular gDNA showed a similar pattern to bacterial cell growth except \n\nthat the rapid increase of gDNA production is noticed after 24 h (Fig. 4C).  \n\nCytotoxic profile \n\nFinally, the cellular cytotoxicity during the R. sulfidophilum growth was evaluated by \n\nresazurin dye and compared with cells treated with heat (positive control). As presented in \n\nFigure 5, at 72 h, end of the fermentation, more than 87% of viable cells were obtained, a \n\n\n\n \n\n 127 \n\nvalue that is acceptable. Thus, as the majority of the cells remain viable, they are \n\ncontributing to the newly synthesized product and as the cell lysis is minimized, the \n\nextracellular medium is not significantly contaminated with the host RNases and other host \n\ncomponents.  \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Cell viability assays during the fermentation time. Heat treated cells were used as \n\npositive controls to induce toxicity. Mean percentage values relative to the untreated cells \n\nand standard error of the mean in three independent experiments are shown. \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\nMicroRNAs have been produced using either prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts, with eukaryotic \n\nexpression vectors (Chen et al. 2007; Huang et al. 2011; Li et al. 2014). Although these \n\nsystems have had complete success, the development of a system capable of producing \n\nrecombinant miRNAs with increased stability and quality for further applications, such as \n\nstructural studies or clinical applications, remains a hurdle to overcome. Recent studies have \n\npointed out that R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374 has great potential in the production of \n\nextracellular RNAs, which can be further applied in structural and biophysical studies and as \n\ntherapeutic agents in a broad range of diseases (Nagao et al. 2014; Suzuki et al. 2011). In \n\nfact, the use of R. sulfidophilum as an alternative host presents a number of advantages over \n\nother prokaryotic hosts for obtaining RNAs, namely the unusual ability to secrete heterologous \n\nnucleic acids during cell growth and the characteristic of not secrete host RNases to the \n\nculture medium, maintaining the integrity and activity of the RNA product. (Ando et al. 2004; \n\nAndo et al. 2006; Nagao et al. 2014; Suzuki et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2009b; Suzuki et al. \n\n2011). As a result, this strategy allows avoiding time-consuming and laborious RNA extraction \n\nmethods.  \n\nHence, in this work and for the first time, R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374 was successfully applied \n\nfor the recombinant biosynthesis and isolation of hsa-pre-miR-29b from both the intra and \n\nextracellular species. Initially, the optimal conditions (0.1 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA, with a heat-\n\nshock of 2 min at 35\u00baC) for transforming R. sulfidophilum were determined. The \n\n\n\n \n\n 128 \n\ntransformation method developed is advantageous because of its simplicity, low cost, high \n\ntransformation efficiency (103 transformants per \u00b5g of plasmid DNA) achieved and the \n\npossibility to transfer relatively large segments of DNA. In addition, bacteria prepared by this \n\nmethod can be frozen and stored for future use.  \n\nAdditionally, the influence of the temperature and sodium chloride concentration in the \n\ngrowth profile of R. sulfidophilum cells under aerobic conditions was also addressed. In \n\ngeneral, according to the results described in this study, the R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374 \n\naerobic cultivation should be performed at 30\u00baC using semi-defined medium, supplemented \n\nwith 30 g/L NaCl, under dark-aerobic conditions, since these conditions allowed relatively \n\nrapid growth with higher optical densities. In fact, our results showed that cultivation under \n\naerobic conditions was similar to that achieved in anaerobic conditions, previously described \n\nin other works (Ando et al. 2004; Ando et al. 2006; Suzuki et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2009a; \n\nSuzuki et al. 2009b; Suzuki et al. 2011), being possible to reach higher growth rates, higher \n\noptical densities and a shorter cultivation time. These results can be explained by the fact \n\nthat R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374 being a facultative phototroph, which is able to grow \n\nanaerobically in the presence of light or aerobically in the dark. Despite this feature, this is \n\nthe first description of RNA production using this bacterium on aerobic conditions. \n\nTherefore, the main purpose of this study was to evaluate the time-course profile of the \n\nproduction of intra and extracellular hsa-pre-miR-29b using R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374. The \n\ntotal yield of the pre-miR-29b inside the cells was 358 \u00b5g/L of culture at 32 h, which is a \n\nquantity almost 17.9 times higher than the value obtained (about 20 ?g from 1 L of culture) \n\nby Suzuki and co-workers for streptavidin RNA aptamer (Suzuki et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. \n\n2011). On the other hand, the maximum production of extracellular pre-miR-29b achieved \n\nwas approximately 182 \u00b5g/L of culture. Furthermore, in order to obtain a high production of \n\nthe extracellular human pre-miR-29b while minimizing the impurities (genomic DNA and \n\nproteins), R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374 should be cultivated up to 40 h. \n\nThe value obtained (182 \u00b5g/L) is more than 100 fold higher than those reported in the \n\nliterature for the production of RNA aptamer and shRNA using this bacterium (Nagao et al. \n\n2014; Suzuki et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2011). In accordance to what has been described by \n\nother authors, the yield obtained for extracellular streptavidin RNA aptamer was 195 ng/L of \n\nculture and 200 ng/L of shRNA, after 70 h of cultivation (stationary phase), using the \n\nmutated-rrn promoter (Table 1). In another study, a yield of 100 ng/L of culture was obtained \n\nunder aerobic conditions in the dark. This result can be explained, because the mutated-rrn \n\npromoter is independent of the FIS protein activation, which is expressed only in early log \n\nphase, and allows the transcription even during the late log and stationary phases (Dryden \n\nand Kaplan 1993; Suzuki et al. 2011). In addition, because the production was observed in the \n\nlog phase but not in the stationary or the post-stationary phase, it is suggested that the \n\nnucleic acids do not originate from the cell autolysis but from active production.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 129 \n\nTable 1 - Comparison of growth rates and RNA production yields in R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374 \n\nunder different growth conditions. \n\n \n\nGlobally, the bioprocess optimization here described using R. sulfidophilum allows the \n\nproduction and isolation of recombinant extracellular pre-miRNA molecules with high yields \n\nas a way to simplify the current extraction methodologies, because this method requires only \n\nthe cultivation of the bacterium for the product biosynthesis. Thus, the RNAs secretion \n\nalready represents a significant advantage for the recovery and purification processes, \n\ncircumventing the need of the lysis procedure that frequently induces RNA denaturation. In \n\naddition, it is expected that the application of this strategy allows suppressing the use of \n\norganic solvents and extremely toxic chemicals which are employed in conventional RNA \n\nisolation techniques and that are biologically hazardous, representing a simplification of the \n\nprocess and allowing an increase in the RNA recovery yield and stability (Fig. 1). The \n\nextracellular production is thought to be very beneficial for the future development of an \n\nefficient process engineering system for industrial production of RNA drugs. Moreover, the \n\nculture volume can be scaled up easily, which is necessary for large-scale industrial \n\npreparation. Therefore, it was described a novel, fast and simple process, economically \n\nfeasible and highly efficient for pre-miRNA isolation. For all these reasons, the approach here \n\nproposed for recombinant production of extracellular pre-miRNAs is not only innovative but \n\nalso presents more advantages in the point-of-view of the potential biological application of \n\nmiRNAs. Furthermore, it is believed that the pre-miRNAs obtained using this protocol, can be \n\napplied in many molecular biology subjects and RNAi-based therapeutics. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT) \n\nthrough the following projects: EXPL/BBB-BIO/1056/2012 and Pest-OE/SAU/UI0709/2014. \n\nPatr\u00edcia Pereira and Augusto Pedro acknowledge the fellowships, SFRH/BD/81914/2011 and \n\nSFRH/BD/81222/2011, respectively from FCT.

Moreover, \n\nit is possible to determine some particular conditions enabling the improvement of the \n\nbinding specificity of the amino acid ligands used to purify microRNA, preserving their \n\nintegrity. The binding responses were detectable and reproducible and allowed the \n\ndetermination of the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). Considering the binding affinities, \n\nit was verified that the pre-miR-29b binds more strongly to L-arginine (KD between 10\n-6 and \n\n10-7M) than to L-lysine (KD between 10\n-5 and 10-7M). Remarkably, the results revealed that the \n\nligands possess high affinity to RNA molecules using buffers with low salt concentration and \n\nno binding responses were detected with high salt concentrations, suggesting that \n\nelectrostatic interactions are mainly responsible for ligand-analyte interaction. Above all, this \n\nstudy showed the importance of SPR for future screening of other ligands that, like the ones \n\ndescribed herein, can be used to design novel microRNA purification platforms which will \n\nhave a significant impact in biopharmaceutical-based therapeutics.  \n\n \n\nKeywords \n\nAmino acid-microRNA interactions; Binding affinities; Circular Dichroism; Recombinant pre-\n\nmiR-29b; Surface Plasmon Resonance  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 140 \n\n\n\n \n\n 141 \n\nIntroduction \n\nOver the past decade, several hundred small non-coding RNA molecules, known as microRNAs \n\n(miRNAs) have emerged as potential biomarkers and drug targets, appearing to be promising \n\nto the next generation of diagnostic and therapeutic tools.1-3 These RNA molecules play \n\nimportant roles in modulating various biological and cellular functions and have potential to \n\ntreat several pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. This \n\nsuggests the use of miRNA as a promising approach in a therapeutic point of view.4-6 Human \n\npre-miR-29b was chosen for this work because it belongs to one of the most interesting miRNA \n\nfamilies identified in humans, being involved in several regulatory actions, namely in tumor-\n\nsuppressing and immune-modulating processes, as well as in the regulation of pathways of \n\nneurodegenerative diseases.5-7 \n\nHence, considering the potential therapeutic application and the mandatory global \n\ndistribution of these novel therapeutics, it is crucial to develop efficient methods for isolation \n\nof pharmaceutical grade miRNAs, with high purity degree and biological activity, envisioning \n\ntheir application in gene therapy. Several strategies are available to isolate and purify miRNA \n\nmolecules chemically synthesized or derived from various biological sources.8,9 However, \n\nthese methods make use of denaturing conditions and structural modifications in the RNA \n\nmolecule can occur, by introduction of tag-sequences. Consequently, these changes can \n\ninduce RNA conformational alterations which may compromise their activity, in addition, \n\nthese procedures are expensive and time-consuming.10,11 More recently, our research group \n\ndeveloped an affinity chromatographic method with amino acids as specific ligands, named \n\namino acid\u2013affinity chromatography, applied to efficiently purify different RNA species (total \n\nRNA, ribosomal RNA, small RNA, 6S RNA and recombinant pre-miR-29b), on the basis of their \n\nbiological function or individual chemical structure.12-17 For these reasons, this \n\nchromatographic method can be an attractive approach for the miRNA purification, since it \n\ncan be successfully employed in the purification of a wide range of biomolecules, based on \n\nspecific and reversible interactions, simulating natural biological processes that are \n\nestablished within the cell. In addition, affinity chromatography is a selective and reliable \n\ntechnique, offering reduced processing time, and capable of preparing therapeutic \n\nbiomolecules with the strict quality assurance.18 However, the problem of finding a suitable \n\nligand in affinity chromatography is not restricted to specificity, but concerns also to the \n\nbinding strength and the kinetics of the ligand\u2013miRNA interaction. This implies that a ligand \n\nwith an optimized dissociation constant will facilitate the successful operation of affinity \n\nchromatography for miRNA purification. \n\nIn the past recent years, Cruz and collaborators applied surface plasmon resonance (SPR) for \n\nthe analysis of the interaction between plasmid DNA and amino acids ligands.19-22 This \n\ntechnique provides both equilibrium and kinetic information about intermolecular \n\ninteractions and is a powerful tool to study the dynamics of nucleic acids\u2013amino acids \n\n\n\n \n\n 142 \n\ninteractions and, consequently, to apply this important structural data in the optimization of \n\nchromatographic systems.23-26 According to these considerations, a comparative study was \n\nperformed to characterize and understand the interactions established between pre-miR-29b \n\nand L-arginine and L-lysine amino acids. For this purpose, we have studied the affinity and the \n\nbinding responses between pre-miR-29b and L-arginine and L-lysine immobilized on a surface \n\nto mimic the affinity support under different experimental conditions, such as, the \n\ncomposition and ionic strength of the elution, buffer and temperature. This study revealed \n\nseveral interesting characteristics of RNA molecules, including natural affinity interactions \n\nthat can occur between L-arginine and L-lysine and pre-miRNA, providing important \n\ninformation that can be further applied in unveiling the miRNA chromatographic behavior in \n\nthese systems. Furthermore, the experimental data allowed to get binding information to \n\nimprove pre-miR-29b purification with low sample consumption, using a rapid and automated \n\nanalysis. Moreover, circular dichroism (CD) was used to evaluate the conformational changes \n\nthat pre-miR-29b may suffer when exposed to certain experimental conditions. In particular, \n\nexperimental conditions can influence the interactions established between pre-miRNA and \n\namino acids, as well as the structure of RNA, leading repulsion or neutralization of the \n\nbiomolecules, or even inducing stabilization or denaturation of the target RNA.  \n\nThe present work evaluates the conformational changes of pre-miR-29b when exposed to \n\ndifferent experimental conditions by circular dichroism (CD) and the binding between the \n\nrecombinant pre-miR-29b and L-arginine/L-lysine by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in \n\ndifferent buffers, salt conditions, pH and temperature to achieve the best binding/elution \n\nconditions. \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 143 \n\nMaterials and Methods \n\nMaterials \n\nL-arginine\u2013Sepharose 4B gel was acquired from Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden) and \n\nLysine-Sepharose 4B was obtained from GE Healthcare Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden). The \n\nguanidinium salt and all the chemicals used in the lysis buffer were obtained from Sigma-\n\nAldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). All buffers used for the chromatographic experiments were \n\nfreshly prepared with sterilized water pre-treated with 0.05% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC; \n\nSigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), filtered through a 0.20 \u00b5m pore size membrane (Schleicher \n\nSchuell, Dassel, Germany) and degassed ultrasonically. The sodium chloride (NaCl) used was \n\npurchased from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain), tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris), HEPES \n\nsodium salt and L-arginine were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA). L-lysine \n\nHydrochloride was from USB, Acide morpholinopropanesulfonique (MOPS) from Fisher \n\nScientific and, finally, potassium dihydrogen phosphate from Chem-Lab NV (Zedelgem, \n\nBelgium). All the materials used in the experiments were RNase-free. \n\nPre-miR-29b biosynthesis and isolation \n\nThe pre-miR-29b used in the experiments was produced by a cell culture of Rhodovulum \n\nsulfidophilum DSM 1374 strain (BCCM/LMG, Belgium) modified with the pBHSR1-RM plasmid \n\ncontaining the sequence of pre-miR-29b.27 Growth was carried out at 30\u00baC under dark-aerobic \n\nconditions, using Nutrient Broth medium (1 g/L beef extract; 2 g/L yeast extract; 5 g/L \n\npeptone and 30 g/L sodium chloride) supplemented with 30 \u00b5g/mL kanamycin. Cells were \n\nrecovered by centrifugation and stored at -20\u00baC. Small RNA was extracted using the acid \n\nguanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method based on the protocol \n\ndescribed by Chomczynski and co-workers.28 Briefly, cells were lysed by adding 5 mL of \n\ndenaturing cell lysis solution (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate; 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 4.0; \n\n0.5% N-laurosylsarcosine and 0.1 M ?-mercaptoethanol). After incubating on ice for 10 min, \n\ncellular debris, genomic DNA and proteins were precipitated by gently adding and mixing 5 \n\nmL of water-saturated phenol and 0.5 mL of 2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.0). The RNA isolation \n\nwas achieved by adding 1 mL of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:1), and by mixing vigorously \n\nuntil two immiscible phases were obtained. The upper aqueous phase, which contained \n\nmostly RNA, was recovered and concentrated by the addition of 5 mL of ice-cold isopropanol. \n\nPrecipitated molecules were recovered by centrifugation at 10 000 g for 20 min at 4\u00baC and \n\nresuspended in 1.5 mL of lysis solution. It was concentrated again with 1.5 mL of ice-cold \n\nisopropanol. After centrifuging for 10 min at 10 000 g (4\u00baC), the RNA pellet was washed with \n\n7.5 mL of 75% ethanol and incubated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by a 5 min \n\ncentrifugation at 10 000 g (4\u00baC). The air-dried RNA pellet was solubilized in 1 mL of 0.05% \n\nDEPC-treated water. Finally, 260 and 280 nm absorbance of the samples was measured using \n\nNanodrop spectrophotometer in order to assess RNA quantity and an agarose gel \n\nelectrophoresis was performed to assess purity. \n\n\n\n \n\n 144 \n\nPre-miR-29b Purification \n\nChromatographic experiments were performed in an \u00c4KTA Avant system with UNICORN 6.1 \n\nsoftware (GE Healthcare). A 10 mm diameter x 20 mm long (about 2 mL) column was packed \n\nwith commercial L-arginine\u2013Sepharose 4B gel. This support is characterized by the \n\nmanufacturer as a cross-linked 4% beaded agarose matrix with a 12-atom spacer and an \n\nextent of labeling between 14 and 20 \u00b5moL/mL. The column was first equilibrated with 0.28 \n\nM of NaCl in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Small RNAs samples (30 \u00b5g) were applied onto \n\nthe column using a 100 \u00b5L loop at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min. After the elution of unbound \n\nspecies with 0.28 M of NaCl in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), the ionic strength of the buffer \n\nwas increased to 0.36 M NaCl in order to elute the pre-miR-29b. The most retained species \n\nwere finally eluted with 0.5 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0), as previously \n\ndescribed.14 The absorbance of the eluate was continuously monitored at 260 nm. All \n\nchromatographic runs were performed at 20\u00baC, by using a specific column containing a water \n\njacket tube connected to a circulating water bath to maintain the temperature. Pre-miR-29b \n\nfractions were pooled according to the chromatograms obtained, and were concentrated and \n\ndesalted with Vivaspin concentrators. Posteriorly, the integrity and purity of pre-miR-29b \n\nsamples isolated from R. sulfidophilum were also analyzed by vertical electrophoresis using \n\nan Amersham Biosciences system (GE Healthcare) with 10% polyacrylamide gel supplemented \n\nwith 8 M urea. Electrophoresis was performed at a running voltage of 125 V for 90 min in TBE \n\nbuffer, pH 8.3, and samples were previously denatured with 97.5% formamide. Gels were \n\nvisualized using a UV transilluminator (UVItec, Cambridge) after staining with GreenSafe \n\nPremium (NZYTech, Lisbon, Portugal).  \n\n \n\nSPR measurements  \n\nAll SPR experiments were performed on a Biacore T200 Biosensor software v 1.0 (Biacore, GE \n\nHealthcare, Sweden) using carboxymethylated dextran-coated sensor chips (CM5 research \n\ngrade). L-arginine and L-lysine (0.2 M in 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 8.5) were immobilized on the \n\nCM5 sensor chip surface, to mimic immobilized ligands in affinity chromatographic supports, \n\nbased on the protocol described by Cruz and co-workers.19 Briefly, the immobilization of L-\n\narginine and L-lysine was performed through amine coupling chemistry using HBS and 1-ethyl-\n\n3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) as a running buffer (7 min, 5 ?L/min) in the \n\nflow cells 2 and 3, respectively. Flow cell 1 was used as reference control for all experiments, \n\nwhich was treated as the other cells, without amino acids. After immobilization, the surfaces \n\nof all flow cells were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.5), followed by HBS-EP \n\ninjection to stabilize the baseline. The immobilized density averaging for L-arginine was 245.6 \n\nRU and for L-lysine was 242.2 RU. Human pre-miR-29b samples used to collect affinity binding \n\ndata were prepared by serial dilutions to obtain the desired concentration range (2.5 to \n\n0.0195 ?M) with adequate buffers, for each experiment. Duplicate injections of each pre-miR-\n\n29b sample were analyzed in random order and a buffer blank was flowed over the L-arginine \n\nand L-lysine surface, as well as over the reference surface, at a flow rate of 2 ?L/min for 7 \n\n\n\n \n\n 145 \n\nmin. No regeneration solution was required since all pre-miR-29b solutions were removed \n\nfrom the surface chip during the dissociation time. Thus, equilibrium binding experiments \n\nwere performed under similar conditions to those used in the affinity chromatography assays \n\n(temperature, pH, ionic strength of the buffer and competitive ligand), in order to \n\nunderstand the biomolecular interactions occurring between ligands and pre-miR-29b. Several \n\nbuffers were studied to determine which are suitable to be used with RNA allowing the \n\nestablishment of interactions involved in miRNA purification, namely (i) 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH \n\n8.0; (ii) 10 mM and 100 mM HEPES buffer, pH 7.4; (iii) 10 mM and 50 mM phosphate buffer, pH \n\n8.0; (iv) 10 mM MOPS, pH 8.0; (v) 280 mM and 500 mM NaCl in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; (vi) \n\n200 mM NaCl supplemented with 8 mM L-arginine in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and, finally, (vii) \n\n200 mM NaCl supplemented with 10 mM L-lysine in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. As previously \n\nmentioned, two different temperatures, 4 and 20\u00baC, were also investigated to address their \n\ninfluence on the interactions. To correct the bulk refractive index background, the signal \n\nobtained for the reference surface was subtracted from sensorgrams for the amino acid \n\nimmobilized on cell surfaces. In addition, subtraction of the blank injection responses \n\n(running buffer without pre-miR-29b) was performed prior to each collection of binding data \n\nfollowing exactly the same time course as the runs with pre-miR-29b. The equilibrium \n\ndissociation constants (KD) were determined by averaging of the resonance unit values (RU) in \n\nthe plateau region of the sensorgrams (300 to 400 sec) to an affinity model, [Req]=Rmax?(1/(1+ \n\nKD/[A]), where Req represents the amount of analyte complexed with the ligand on the \n\nsurface, [A] is the analyte concentration, and Rmax is the maximum binding capacity of the \n\nsurface. Rmax was also determined by the previous mathematical model. All data processing \n\nand analyses were performed in BIAevaluation software v.4.1. \n\n \n\nStructural analysis of pre-miR-29b samples by Circular Dichroism (CD) \n\nCD was used to monitor the structural behavior of pre-miR-29b (50 ?g/mL) when subjected at \n\ndifferent buffer conditions. CD spectra were obtained using a quartz rectangular cell with an \n\noptical path length of 0.1 cm at a constant temperature of 25\u00baC, in a Jasco J-1850 \n\nSpectrophotometer (Jasco, Easton, MD, USA). Spectra were recorded from 320 to 215 nm at a \n\nscan speed of 10 nm/min and a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm. All measurements were \n\nconducted under a constant nitrogen gas flow, to purge the ozone generated by the light \n\nsource of the instrument. The data were collected in triplicate and the average spectra are \n\npresented for each sample after subtraction of the buffer contribution. The CD signal was \n\nconverted to molar ellipticity. Noise in the data was smoothed using Jasco J-1850 software, \n\nincluding the Fast Fourier transform algorithm, which allows enhancement of most noisy \n\nspectra without distorting their peak shape.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 146 \n\nResults and Discussion  \n\nMiRNAs represents an important target of a wide analysis, particularly relevant, in the \n\ndiagnostic of several disorders, as well as in basic and applied science research. For this \n\nreason, the preparation of highly purified miRNAs in large quantity arises as one of the most \n\nimportant challenges in the development of therapeutic strategies based on the use of \n\nmiRNAs.29 In this study, pre-miR-29b biosynthesis was obtained from a cell culture of \n\nrecombinant Rhodovulum sulfidophilum DSM 1374 strain in a standard bacterial culture.15 \n\nHowever, the RNAs obtained from this culture need to be further purified in order to isolate \n\nthe target pre-miR-29b from other host sRNAs. Thus, pre-miR-29b isolation was achieved \n\nusing an increasing sodium chloride gradient in L-arginine-affinity chromatography, as \n\ndescribed by Pereira and co-workers.14 The quality of the pure pre-miR-29b stock solution was \n\nexamined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, as shown in Fig. 1. In affinity \n\nchromatography, elution strategy can be performed either specifically, using a competitive \n\nagent, or non-specifically, by changing the pH, ionic strength or polarity of the buffer.  \n\n \n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of pure pre-miR-29b samples. Lane S, \n\nInitial sample; Lanes 1, transfer RNAs; Lane 2, pre-miR-29b; Lane 3, pre-miR-29b plus transfer \n\nRNAs. \n\n \n\nHence, this SPR study was developed in order to characterize the interactions between pre-\n\nmiR-29b and L-arginine and L-lysine as biospecific ligands. For this purpose, changes in the \n\nelution buffer composition, ionic strength or temperature were performed in order to observe \n\ntheir effects on biomolecular interactions. The amino acids L-arginine and L-lysine were \n\nchosen because they are conserved amino acids in the active center of the Argonaute protein, \n\nwhich is part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), suggesting that they have an \n\nimportant role in the cellular recognition of the 3' overhang of the pre-miRNA.30,31 So, it is \n\nexpected that this biorecognition can be exploited to implement a chromatographic \n\npurification methodology for pre-miR-29b. Initially, L-arginine and L-lysine were immobilized \n\non CM5 sensor chip via amine coupling chemistry at pH 8.5 (below their isoelectric point), as \n\n\n\n \n\n 147 \n\ndescribed by Cruz and collaborators.19 This protocol of immobilization ensures that the \n\nguanidine functional groups (?-amino group) of L-arginine and L-lysine are positively charged \n\nand the ?-NH2 group is attached to the reactive ester groups of the chip. All SPR equilibrium \n\ndata were fitted to a steady state bimolecular interaction model. The SPR binding profile \n\n(square-shaped) was identical for all complexes and some were exemplified in Fig. 2. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - SPR analysis of pre-miR-29b interaction with L-lysine ligands in different buffers, at \n\n4 and 20\u00baC. Sensorgrams and equilibrium-binding analysis: (a) 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer (4\u00baC), (b) \n\n10 mM MOPS (20\u00baC) and (c) 10 mM HEPES (20\u00baC). \n\n \n\nBiomolecular Interactions between pre-miR-29b and L-arginine  \n\nRecently, our research group has demonstrated the potential of the arginine amino acid in \n\nthe purification of RNA, suggesting that the binding mechanism involves multiple non-\n\ncovalent interactions with RNA, due to its ability to interact in different conformation \n\narrangements, the length of its side chain, the guanidine functional group and its ability to \n\nproduce hydrogen bond geometries.12,17,32 Thereby, since RNA is negatively charged due to the \n\nphosphate groups in the backbone, it is easy to predict favorable electrostatic interactions \n\nbetween RNA phosphate groups and L-arginine. \n\nInterestingly, the SPR sensorgrams obtained with L-arginine ligand, present response profiles \n\nin shaped of square, indicating rapid dissociation (450 sec), i.e., the binding assays suggest \n\nthat pre-miR-29b biomolecules interact with the immobilized L-arginine, and that these \n\ninteractions are reversible. The KD values are listed in Table 1. At 20\u00baC, in the range of \n\nconcentrations tested, SPR responses for L-arginine-pre-miR-29b were obtained in Tris-HCl, \n\nNaCl and NaCl supplemented with L-lysine buffers. The equilibrium dissociation constants \n\ndemonstrate that Tris-HCl (10 mM) promote lower ligand?analyte affinity (KD = \n\n\n\n \n\n 148 \n\n5.11x10?6\u00b14.4x10?7 M) when compared with the values obtained for NaCl (KD = 4.06x10\n-\n\n7\u00b13.5x10?8 M). In fact, in chromatography, the Tris-HCl buffer can be used to promote the \n\nretention of total small RNAs onto the L-arginine support, but the application of NaCl in the \n\nbinding buffer is responsible for the higher selectivity towards the target miRNA. On the other \n\nhand, negligible (? 5 RU) non-specific binding was detected when using the following buffers: \n\nphosphate (10 and 50 mM), HEPES (10 and 100 mM) and MOPS (10 mM), regardless of their \n\nconcentration, indicating that L-arginine do not interact with pre-miR-29b under these \n\nconditions (data not shown). \n\nIn contrast, the ionic strength of buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl supplemented with NaCl) has a \n\nsignificant effect on the binding of pre-miR-29b. The SPR response to the pre-miR-29b \n\nsolution in 500 mM NaCl was very low (&lt;5 RU), implying that the chromatographic binding \n\nand elution of pre-miR-29b may be manipulated with this parameter. In the sensorgrams was \n\nnotorious the dissociation in the first 100 sec using 500 mM NaCl (data not shown), indicating \n\nthat the high content of NaCl results in the loss of pre-miR-29b binding. Our results also \n\nrevealed that when a moderate salt concentration (280 mM NaCl) is used, high binding \n\nresponses were obtained (KD = 4.06x10\n-7\u00b13.5x10?8 M). In general, the affinity of the pre-miR-\n\n29b with the L-arginine surface was high (KD ? 10\n?6 M) at 20\u00baC. These results may be \n\ncorrelated with the chromatographic experiments, where the total retention of pre-miR-29b \n\ncould be achieved using a low concentration of NaCl (280 mM) and high concentrations (500 \n\nmM NaCl) lead to its elution.14 Besides, the salt concentration can also have a positive effect \n\non RNA folding as well as on the stabilization of non-covalent RNA\u2013amino acid interactions \n\nduring the purification, once the salt allows the single-stranded nucleic acid molecules to \n\nform stable hydrogen bonds between their complementary bases. In this case, the \n\nchromatographic interaction was promoted by using a low ionic strength buffer and the \n\nselective elution of the bound species was achieved by increasing the NaCl concentration.14 \n\nMoreover, it was verified that the pre-miR-29b was eluted at a higher ionic strength, \n\nindicating a stronger interaction than other contaminants. We also evaluated the influence of \n\na competing agent (L-arginine and L-lysine) in the buffer, as a way to conclude about the use \n\nof these amino acids to promote binding or elution of the pre-miR-29b to the L-arginine \n\nligand. The experiments were carried out using different concentrations, from 8 to 19 mM of \n\nL-arginine and 10 to 16 mM of L-lysine in the 200 mM NaCl buffer. However, for the highest \n\nconcentrations it was not verified the binding of pre-miR-29b to the L-arginine ligand (results \n\nnot shown). In these experiments, it was only obtained a binding response for the condition of \n\n10 mM of L-lysine in 200 mM NaCl (KD = 3.53x10\n-6\u00b11.9x10-7 M), while 8 mM of L-arginine \n\nresulted in a negligible (? 5 RU) sensor response to the pre-miR-29b solution. This result is in \n\naccordance with some evidences obtained in L-arginine-affinity chromatography, once this \n\ncondition can be used to the pre-miR-29b elution, as it functions as a competitive agent. This \n\nbehavior can be due to the positive character of these amino acids that promotes the binding \n\nof pre-miR-29b to the free amino acid present in the buffer by electrostatic interactions, \n\n\n\n \n\n 149 \n\ninducing the elution of bound pre-miR-29b. Moreover, the results suggest that the elution of \n\nbound pre-miR-29b can be more effective when using L-lysine in the buffer. As demonstrated \n\nin Table 1, the KD value for 10 mM L-lysine is higher than the value obtained at 280 mM NaCl, \n\nindicating that the affinity of pre-miR-29b to the L-arginine ligand is higher for the 280 mM \n\nNaCl condition, and lysine is expected to weaken the interaction.  \n\nConsidering that RNA is an unstable molecule and has a very short half-life once extracted, \n\nthe effect of temperature in the miRNA-arginine binding is a critical parameter in RNA \n\npurification.33 In contrary to the results achieved for the temperature of 20\u00baC, at 4\u00baC it was \n\nonly found SPR response for L-arginine and pre-miR-29b using 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer. The \n\ndissociation constants for Tris-HCl are of the same order of magnitude at 20 and 4\u00baC (KD = \n\n1.34x10-6\u00b12.3x10-7 M), but a slightly higher affinity was found for 4\u00baC, suggesting stronger \n\ninteractions at lower temperatures. Non-specific binding (? 5 RU) was detected when using \n\nthe other buffers, regardless their concentration, indicating that no significant interactions \n\noccur between pre-miR-29b and L-arginine ligand in these conditions (data not shown). The KD \n\nvalues obtained are consistent with the chromatographic results previously reported by \n\nPereira and collaborators14, where the pre-miR-29b retention in the L-arginine-agarose \n\nsupport was higher for the lowest temperature studied (4\u00baC), suggesting that the temperature \n\nis a critical factor in the binding pre-miR-29b.  \n\nSummarizing, the affinity order of pre-miR-29b to L-arginine was 280 mM NaCl > 10 mM Tris-\n\nHCl ? 10 mM L-lysine in 200 mM NaCl, with NaCl promoting the highest affinity for the pre-\n\nmiR-29b to the L-arginine surface. Hence, this comparative study reinforces the idea that the \n\nbinding mechanism inherent to the biorecognition between the L-arginine amino acid and pre-\n\nmiR-29b molecules can result from the combination of several phenomenological interactions \n\nsuch as electrostatic interactions, multiple hydrogen bond and van der Waals forces.17 Thus, \n\nit is reasonable to suggest that the retention of RNA in L-arginine is due to its side chain, \n\nwhich can promote multi contacts with RNA backbone or bases, according to RNA \n\nfolding.32,34,35 Additionally, recent studies with saturation transfer difference-nuclear \n\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy and SPR reported that guanine polynucleotides interact \n\npreferably with L-arginine through the sugar-phosphate backbone.\n18,19 Thus, another \n\nexplanation for these findings is related with pre-miR-29 structural features that seem to be \n\nrelevant on its distinct retention behavior in the arginine ligand. Pre-miR-29b is a small RNA \n\nmolecule with a stem-loop shape consisting of two long irregular double-stranded stem \n\nregions, which are interrupted by a largely single-stranded internal loop. In addition, along \n\nthe bulge of pre-miR-29b and through the continuous stem sequences there are several \n\nguanines, which were described to interact preferably with arginine. Hence, the nucleotide \n\nbases composition and exposure can also favor other biomolecular interactions, responsible \n\nfor the specificity and biorecognition found in the L-arginine ligand. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 150 \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Equilibrium analysis of the pre-miR-29.\n\n    Buffers    \n\n  \nTris-HCl \n(10 mM) \n\nMOPS \n(10 mM) \n\nHEPES \n(10 mM) \n\nNaCl \n(280 mM) \n\nL-arginine \n(8 mM) \n\nL-lysine \n(10 mM) \n\nL-arginine \n\n20\u00baC 5.11\u00d710-6\u00b14.4\u00d710-7 - - 4.06\u00d710-7\u00b13.5\u00d710-8 - 3.53\u00d710-6\u00b11.9\u00d710-7 \n\n4\u00baC 1.34\u00d710-6\u00b12.3\u00d710-7 - - - - - \n\nL-lysine \n\n20\u00baC 3.24\u00d710-7\u00b14.6\u00d710-8 1.74\u00d710-5\u00b14.1\u00d710-6 2.47\u00d710-5\u00b16.6\u00d710-6 9.96\u00d710-7\u00b13.5\u00d710-8 2.08\u00d710-6\u00b14.4\u00d710-7 2.28\u00d710-6\u00b16.3\u00d710-7 \n\n4\u00baC 8.76\u00d710-6\u00b16.8\u00d710-7 2.31\u00d710-5\u00b13.1\u00d710-6 3.95\u00d710-6\u00b11.5\u00d710-7 - - - \n\n\n\n \n\n 151 \n\nBiomolecular Interactions between pre-miR-29b and L-lysine \n\nPrevious studies have shown that the main interactions occurring between nucleic acids and \n\nthe L-lysine amino acid are electrostatic, because of its amine groups.\n36-38 Moreover, L-lysine \n\nhas also some characteristics, such as the lateral side chain with significant length and ability \n\nto interact with several RNA classes even in different conformational rearrangements, which \n\nmay produce hydrogen bond geometries, reinforcing the establishment of multiple non-\n\ncovalent interactions involved in the specific recognition mechanism of nucleic acids.38 \n\nIndeed, besides the multiple interactions (electrostatic interactions, van de Waals forces and \n\nhydrogen bonds) that L-lysine can establish with the RNA backbone or with the more exposed \n\nbases, several sRNAs can also interact and be recognized by the presence of hydrophobic \n\ninteractions with the aliphatic portion of L-lysine side chain.\n15 Considering this complex \n\nbiorecognition mechanism, it is important to study the influence of experimental conditions \n\non the interaction occurring between pre-miR-29b and L-lysine amino acid, resulting in \n\ndifferent binding affinities. It was verified that pre-miR-29b binds more strongly to L-lysine in \n\n10 mM Tris-HCl and 280 mM NaCl at 20\u00baC (KD = 3.24x10\n-7\u00b14.6x10-8 M and KD = 9.96x10\n\n-7\u00b13.5x10-8 \n\nM, respectively) than in 10 mM HEPES (KD = 2.47\u00d710\n?5\u00b16.6\u00d710?6 M) or 10 mM MOPS buffers (KD = \n\n1.74\u00d710?5\u00b14.1\u00d710?6 M). In fact, these findings are in agreement with the results reported in \n\nthe literature, where Tris-HCl buffer is commonly used to promote the binding of RNA to L-\n\nlysine. Negligible binding (? 5 RU) was detected when the following buffers were used: \n\nphosphate (10 mM and 50 mM) and HEPES (100 mM), indicating that pre-miR-29b has no \n\naffinity to L-lysine under these conditions. Similarly to the results obtained to L-arginine, the \n\nionic strength of buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl supplemented with NaCl or with amino acids) has an \n\neffect on the binding of pre-miR-29b to L-lysine. Our findings demonstrate that when high \n\nconcentrations of salt (500 mM NaCl) or amino acids are used, no binding responses of pre-\n\nmiR-29b are observed and, consequently, these conditions can be used for the elution of the \n\ntarget biomolecule in chromatography. The addition of 10 mM of L-lysine in 200 mM NaCl \n\nresulted in a binding response characterized by KD = 2.28x10\n-6\u00b16.3\u00d710?7 M and the \n\nsupplementation with 8 mM of L-arginine in 200 mM NaCl resulted in a KD = 2.08x10\n-6\u00b14.4\u00d710?7 \n\nM. Although these concentrations of competing agents induce binding of pre-miR-29b, the \n\ninteraction is weaker when compared with Tris-HCl. Briefly, the affinity order for pre-miR-\n\n29b binding to L-lysine was 10 mM Tris-HCl ? 280 mM NaCl > 10 mM L-lysine ? 8 mM L-arginine \n\nin 200 mM NaCl > 10 mM HEPES ? 10 mM MOPS, thus Tris-HCl and NaCl buffers induced the \n\ngreater affinity to L-lysine surface, followed by HEPES and MOPS (Table 1).  \n\nIn this study it was also evaluated the effect of decreasing the temperature to 4\u00baC on the \n\nbinding of pre-miR-29b to the L-lysine surface, comparing with the binding at 20\u00baC. The \n\nbinding responses is similar to that obtained at 20\u00baC, illustrating that the interactions \n\nbetween L-lysine and pre-miR-29b also occur under these conditions. However, some \n\ndifferences were found in KD values determined at 4\u00baC (3.24x10\n-7 M to 8.76x10?6 M for 10 mM \n\nTris-HCl; 2.47x10-5 M to 3.95x10?6 M for 10 mM HEPES and 1.74x10?5 to 2.31x10?5 M for 10 mM \n\n\n\n \n\n 152 \n\nMOPS, at 20 and 4\u00baC, respectively). In general, the KD values obtained are consistent with the \n\nchromatographic results, which the lowest temperature studied induced higher pre-miR-29b \n\nretention onto the L-lysine-agarose support (data not shown). Globally, these results can also \n\nbe related with the pre-miRNA structure, which presents continuous stem sequences mostly \n\ncontaining guanines that are described to preferentially interact with L-lysine due to hydrogen \n\nbonds that are established with one of the donor atoms.39,40  \n\nBriefly, to compare the salt influence on the binding of pre-miR-29b to the L-arginine and L-\n\nlysine surfaces, several buffers were analyzed. In general, the maximum RU signal was higher \n\nfor the L-lysine than for the L-arginine surface (Fig. 3).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 3 - Relative resonance response (RU) with different running buffers at 450 s after \n\ninjection of pre-miR-29b at a concentration of 1.25 ?M, at 20\u00baC, in L-arginine and L-lysine \n\nsurfaces. \n\n \n\nThe experiments showed a low resonance response level with both surfaces (normalized \n\nsignal). It was found that the maximum binding between pre-miR-29b and immobilized L-\n\narginine and L-lysine was observed in 280 mM NaCl, followed by 10 mM Tris-HCl, whereas the \n\nlowest binding was observed in 200 mM NaCl supplemented with 8 mM L-arginine or 10 mM L-\n\nlysine, 10 mM HEPES and 10 mM MOPS (Fig. 3). Thus, our affinity data show that Tris-HCl and \n\nNaCl are optimal buffers for interaction assays and distinct buffer environments such as MOPS \n\nor HEPES did not enhanced the binding to L-arginine and L-lysine. Overall, these results \n\nprovide suitable conditions to induce pre-miRNA binding, thereby increasing the selectivity \n\nand improving efficient microRNA separation. It was also proved that under these conditions \n\n(ionic strength and buffer composition) the electrostatic interactions are favored between \n\nthe amino positive groups of the L-arginine and L-lysine and the negative phosphate groups of \n\nthe pre-miR-29b, mainly with guanosine.  \n\nThese results demonstrated that SPR allows making a screening of ligands that, like the ones \n\ndescribed herein, can be used to design and implement novel miRNA purification methods. \n\n\n\n \n\n 153 \n\nPre-miR-29b structural analysis  \n\nBoth ligands promoted the biorecognition of pre-miR-29b as well as an effective interaction \n\nfor most conditions studied. To select the buffer that is able to enhance the pre-miR-29b \n\nbinding to the amino acids ligands and to evaluate the effect of the different conditions in \n\nthe pre-miR-29b structural stability, four buffers were analyzed (Tris-HCl, HEPES buffer, \n\nMOPS, phosphate buffer) by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. Thus, structural \n\ncharacterization of the pre-miR-29b under different experimental conditions give additional \n\ninformation about the interactions with the ligands and also about the suitable conditions \n\nthat must be used in chromatographic procedures to purify the target biomolecules while \n\nmaintaining its stability and biological activity. CD technique offers good resolution, provides \n\nsensitive spectra and it has been widely used in structural determination of biomolecules \n\n(proteins, nucleic acids, etc.). Quantitative analysis of CD spectra is possible, but, as with any \n\nassay, the correct and proper interpretation of the results depends on an accurate \n\nunderstanding of the procedure. The spectra in Figure 4 are given in terms of molar ellipticity \n\nthus making it possible to directly compare the intensity of the bands obtained for different \n\nsamples. CD spectra of the pre-miR-29b show characteristic peaks around 210 nm (negative \n\nmaximum signal) and 265 nm (positive maximum signal). The comparison with the CD \n\nspectrum of established nucleic acids structures confirms that the pre-miRNA possesses a \n\nstem-loop structure because the CD spectral pattern typically indicates the B-form RNA \n\nduplex.15,41 Although, CD is not sensible to detect the contamination of other cytosol \n\ncontaining miRNAs, it is sensible to detect the contamination of other biomolecules. \n\nHowever, the pre-miR-29 subjected to this analysis has a purity of 98%, and it is unlikely that \n\nthe sample is contaminated, being not expected changes in the CD spectra resulting from \n\ncontamination. \n\nIn Figure 4 are shown the CD spectra resulting from the evaluation of pre-miR-29b in four \n\nbuffers, after an initial 15 min incubation in Tris-HCl buffer (10 mM) and HEPES (10 mM). The \n\nCD spectra of the pre-miRNA sample in Tris-HCl and HEPES show typical CD spectrum of RNA, \n\nwith a positive band at 265 nm and a negative band at 210 nm, similar to the obtained with \n\nDEPC water. However, a significant difference in the bands magnitude of the pre-miR-29b \n\nspectra was found (Figure 4). \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 154 \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Circular Dichroism spectra of the pre-miR-29b. \n\n \n\nThese results are consistent with the responses obtained with SPR, suggesting that Tris-HCl is \n\na valuable choice for promoting pre-miRNA?L-arginine/lysine binding interactions in future \n\napplications. In the presence of HEPES or MOPS, the electrostatic interaction between the L-\n\narginine and L-lysine surface and the pre-miR-29b backbone could be more favored, since \n\nthese buffers at neutral pH are a zwitterionic molecule with a positive charge on one of the \n\nprotonated nitrogens. This can reduce the repulsive electrostatic interaction between \n\ncharged phosphate groups of pre-miR-29b, stabilizing the pre-miRNA molecule and favoring \n\nthe interaction with the amino acids. By analyzing the CD spectra of pre-miR-29b in MOPS (10 \n\nmM), it is visible a decrease of intensity of the positive band as well as the negative band. By \n\nthe CD spectra analysis of Figure 4, it is evident a strong modification in the RNA structure for \n\nthe phosphate buffer. This data can also justify why pre-miR-29b molecules don\u2019t interact \n\nwith the L-arginine or L-lysine supports in the presence of phosphate buffer due to the \n\nincrease of the repulsions with the pre-miR-29b backbone. In contrast, in the presence of salt \n\n(280 mM NaCl), phosphate groups of the pre-miR-29b backbone are effectively screened by \n\nthe salt counterions resulting in a more compact and less regular structure. The data \n\nobtained from SPR can play an important role in the optimization of chromatographic-based \n\npurification processes since it allows the determination of which buffers favor interactions of \n\nthe target biomolecule with the chromatographic support. Moreover, the conjugation with \n\nthe CD technique allows the confirmation of which buffers are able to maintain the stability \n\nof the miRNA. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 155 \n\nConclusions \n\nThe binding affinity quantification between pre-miR-29b and L-arginine and L-lysine surfaces \n\nwas examined by SPR technique, under different conditions, in order to mimic the \n\nimmobilized ligand onto an affinity chromatographic support, and to verify the effect of these \n\nconditions on the interactions and stability of the molecule. Therefore, several experimental \n\nconditions for amino acids ligands-pre-miR-29b binding were characterized, and an optimal \n\nset of buffers as well as temperature conditions were defined. Distinct buffers affected the \n\ninteraction strength with an increased response in presence of Tris-HCl and NaCl. These \n\nresults provide suitable conditions to induce pre-miRNA binding, thereby increasing the \n\nselectivity and improving efficient miRNA separation. The predominant interactions of pre-\n\nmiR-29b with L-arginine and L-lysine ligands are ionic between the amino positive groups of \n\nthe L-arginine and L-lysine and the negative phosphate groups of the pre-miR-29b and \n\nhydrogen bonds with the more exposed bases, mainly with guanosine. Overall, the present \n\nstudy showed that SPR can be used as a first technique to screen, manipulate, determine and \n\nestablish the best binding/elution conditions that can lead to an improved performance and \n\nselectivity of the chromatographic process. In addition, it was demonstrated that although \n\nsome conditions used in chromatographic experiments favor multiple interactions between \n\nthe pre-miR-29b and the respective ligand (L-arginine and L-lysine), these conditions can \n\naffect the structural stability of the target molecule. From CD, it was possible to conclude \n\nthat the biorecognition observed by the pre-miR-29b can be related to the higher availability \n\nand base exposition, which confers a different conformational structure of this molecule. \n\nMoreover, the highest equilibrium dissociation constants determined by SPR ranged from 10?6 \n\nto 10?7 M to L-arginine and from 10\n?5 to 10?7 M to L-lysine, indicating that pre-miR-29b showed \n\nhigh binding affinity on these surfaces. In addition, the results obtained in this study, provide \n\nvaluable and relevant information that can be further applied in unveiling the miRNA \n\nchromatographic behavior in these systems, in order to improve the binding of the pre-miR-\n\n29b onto the amino acids-based supports, preserving their structural stability, integrity and \n\nactivity. In conclusion, it was proved that the association of these two techniques might be a \n\npowerful strategy to define the best conditions to be applied in the miRNA purification. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), \n\nthrough the projects EXPL/BBB-BIO/1056/2012, Pest-OE/SAU/UI0709/2014 and FCOMP-01-\n\n0124-FEDER-041068 \u2013 EXPL/QEQ-MED/1068/2013.

Owing  to the  commercial  interest  in  these  approaches,  there  is a  growing  interest  in\nthe  development  of innovative  procedures  to easily  and  efficiently  purify  the RNA.  Thus,  several  chro-\nmatographic  and non-chromatographic  methods  have  been  reported  to  accomplish  this  purpose,  but  not\nall  of these  strategies  allow  the  efficient  separation  of miRNAs.  The  present  study  describes  a new strategy\nthat  uses  a  lysine  ligand  in  affinity  chromatography  to  efficiently  separate  pre-miR-29  from  a small  RNAs\nmixture.  The  interest  on  this  biomolecule  is  related  to the  fact that  pre-miR-29  deficiencies  or  excesses\nhave  been  associated  to a number  of  clinically  important  diseases.

Introduction\n\nCurrently, microRNA (miRNA) is considered a powerful biolog-\nical material that is directly involved in performing or controlling\nmany biological functions [1]. Thus, understanding the role of sev-\neral miRNAs present in cellular processes is critical to develop\nnew diagnosis methods or drugs for comprising and treating ill-\nness. Recently, differential expression of miRNAs, in patients with\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) suggests that they might have key reg-\nulatory roles in this neurodegenerative disease [2]. Hebert and\ncollaborators showed that miR-29 is potentially involved in the\nregulation of ?-amyloid precursor protein-converting enzyme 1\n(BACE1) expression because in vitro studies revealed that miR-\n29 cluster was significantly decreased in AD patients displaying\nabnormally high BACE1 protein levels, leading the generation and\nsubsequent accumulation of ?-amyloid [3]. These findings raised\nthe possibility to use miR-29 as a potential therapeutic target for\nAD therapy. In fact, miRNAs play a prominent role in the posttran-\nscriptional regulation of gene expression, since it prevents protein\nsynthesis by inducing the messenger RNA degradation, with a high\nspecificity degree [3]. Nevertheless, to get pre-miR-29 as a suitable\n\n? Corresponding author. Tel.: +351 275 329 074; fax: +351 275 329 099.\nE-mail address: fani.sousa@fcsaude.ubi.pt (F. Sousa).\n\nproduct for therapeutic applications it is necessary to guarantee\nits purity, stability and integrity. Regardless of the principle of\nRNA isolation used, purification protocols have a number of com-\nmon requirements, because it is a critical process due to the high\nrisk of RNA degradation during the procedure, by the presence of\nRNA degrading enzymes, once RNA molecule is very susceptible to\nchemical and enzymatic degradation [4].\n\nHence, several kits are commercially available for miRNA iso-\nlation from a diverse variety of samples; these methods allow the\nseparation of miRNAs from high molecular weight RNA [4]. Further-\nmore, there are several chromatographic methods reported in the\nliterature for the purification of the RNAs [5,6]. In these methods,\ndifferent tags are introduced into RNA molecules, which subse-\nquently have to be released from the chromatographic support by\ncompetitive elution or cleaved off by a protease [5,6], which may\ninduce conformational changes in RNA and are expensive proce-\ndures. The approach to overcome these limitations includes the\nrecent development, by our research group, of an affinity chro-\nmatographic (AC) method with amino acids as specific ligands,\napplied for plasmid DNA [7\u20139] and RNA [10] purification allowing\nan improvement in the purification technologies since this tech-\nnique exploits natural biological processes of specific recognition\nof the target biomolecules [11].\n\nIn this study, a lysine-agarose support was  tested to purify pre-\nmiR-29 from a complex mixture containing small RNAs (sRNAs)\n\n0021-9673/$ \u2013 see front matter \u00a9  2014 Elsevier B.V.

In 1978, Jones et al. [12] employed\nthe lysine ligand to separate RNA species with different molecular\nweights, using a linear gradient of sodium chloride (NaCl). Building\non these considerations, it is interesting to verify if the lysine matrix\nmay contribute to the separation of pre-miR-29 and to understand\nthe interaction mechanism underlying the specificity of the sup-\nport that allowed a biorecognition of the pre-miR-29. Therefore,\nthis matrix allowed the efficient isolation and purification of pre-\nmiR-29 from the other sRNAs. These findings will strengthen the\npossibility of using lysine-affinity chromatography as a potential\nenabling technology in the downstream process of pre-miRNA for\ntherapeutic applications.\n\n2.  Materials and methods\n\n2.1.  Pre-miR-29 production and purification\n\nThe pre-miR-29 used in the experiments was produced by a cell\nculture of Rhodovulum sulfidophilum DSM 1374 strain (BCCM/LMG)\nmodified with the plasmid pBHSR1-RM [13] containing the\nsequence of pre-miR-29. Growth was carried out at 30 ?C, using\nNutrient Broth medium (1 g/L beef extract; 2 g/L yeast extract; 5 g/L\npeptone and 5 g/L NaCl) supplemented with 30 ?g/mL kanamycin.\nsRNA was extracted using the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-\nphenol-chloroform method based on the protocol described by\nMartins et al. [10]. Chromatographic experiments were performed\nin an \u00c4KTA Avant system with UNICORN 6 software (GE Health-\ncare). A 10 mm diameter \u00d7 20 mm long (about 2 mL)  column was\npacked with Lysine-agarose matrix (GE Healthcare). All solutions\nwere freshly prepared using 0.05% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-\ntreated water and were filtered through a 0.20 ?m pore size\nmembrane. Chromatographic runs were performed at 20 ?C. The\ncolumn was first equilibrated with 2.0 M of (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM\nTris buffer (pH 8.0). sRNAs samples (40 ?g) were applied onto the\ncolumn using a 100 ?L loop at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min. After the\nelution of unbound species, the ionic strength of the buffer was\ndecreased to 1.5 and 1.1 M of (NH4)2SO4 and then to 10 mM Tris\nbuffer (pH 8.0). The absorbance of the eluate was continuously\nmonitored at 260 nm.  Fractions were pooled according to the chro-\nmatograms obtained, and following concentration and desalting\nwith Vivaspin concentrators. The integrity of pre-miR-29 samples\nwas analyzed by vertical electrophoresis with 10% polyacrylamide\ngel [10].\n\n2.2. PCR analysis\n\nPre-miR-29 identification was assessed using polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR). cDNAs synthesis was performed using RevertAid\nFirst Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas), according to manu-\nfacturer\u2019s instructions. A total of 0.5 ?g of RNA samples collected\nfrom the chromatographic purification process with lysine\u2013agarose\ncolumn was used to initiate cDNA synthesis, which was  denatured\nfor 5 min  at 65 ?C with 20 pmol of gene-specific primer (5? GAC\nAGC GGT ATG ATC CCC CAA 3?). Then, PCR reactions were carried\nout using 1 ?L of cDNA in a 25 ?L reaction containing 0.125 U of\nSupreme DNA polymerase (NZYtech) and 150 nM of each primer.\nSpecific primers for cDNA, designed from RNA database informa-\ntion, were used to amplify a fragment of 145 bp (Fw \u2013 GGA AGC\nTGG TTT CAT ATG GTG and Rv \u2013 CCC CCA AGA ACA CTG ATT TC).\nPCR was conducted as follows: denaturation at 95 ?C for 5 min, fol-\nlowed by 40 cycles at 95 ?C for 30 s, 63 ?C for 30 s and 72 ?C for 15 s,\nand a final elongation step at 72 ?C for 5 min. To confirm the pres-\nence and purity of amplicons, PCR products were analyzed using 1%\nagarose gel electrophoresis [14]. The DNA molecular weight marker\nwas obtained from Vivantis Technologies.\n\n3.  Results and discussion\n\nIn  the present study, the applicability of lysine-affinity chro-\nmatography in the RNA downstream process was  exploited, to\npurify pre-miR-29 from a sRNA complex mixture. The lysine amino\nacid was  studied due to the fact of being conserved in the active cen-\ntre of the PAZ domains of the Argonaute proteins, suggesting that it\nhas an important role in the specific recognition of the pre-miRNA\nafter which occurs the degradation of mRNA [15]. In this work, it\nwas produced a pre-miRNA instead of the mature miRNA consid-\nering their structural characteristics, specifically the single chain\nwith ?100 nucleotides, being some unpaired in the 3? overhang,\nwhich will possibly facilitate the purification, due to the higher\nbases exposure [16]. Previous published studies, have shown that\nthe main interactions between nucleic acids [12,17] and the lysine\namino acid are ionic, because of its amine groups. Thus, initial\nexperiments were performed to choose the best binding/elution\nstrategy for pre-miR-29 using a gradient of NaCl. However, under\nthese conditions the RNA binding was not effective and the selec-\ntive purification of pre-miRNA was not possible to be achieved (data\nnot shown). Therefore, a different strategy was  used to promote the\nRNA binding. In a first step, lysine-agarose column was  equilibrated\nwith 2 M (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). After injection of\nthe 40 ?g of pre-miR-29 containing mixture, was obtained a peak\n(Fig. 1A) where pre-miR-29 was  not detected (data not shown).\nThis can result either from the elution of unbound material that\npresents a lower affinity to the matrix or by the alteration in the\nionic strength since the injected RNA sample is dissolved in H2O.\nThe ionic strength of the buffer was decreased to 1.5 and 1.1 M\n(NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0) in order to elute specific\nmolecules in a peak 2. The chromatographic run was  concluded\nwith a final elution step, using 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0), to recover\nthe strongly bound species. The polyacrylamide gel electrophore-\nsis was used to detect and identify different sRNAs species eluted\nin each peak and assess of RNA integrity and purity (Fig. 1B). The\nanalysis of electrophoresis revealed that the peak 1 mostly cor-\nresponds to the transfer RNA (tRNA) (lane 1), while pre-miR-29\nremained bound under the same conditions, being identified in the\npeak 2 (lane 2). The electrophoretic evaluation of fractions recov-\nered from the peak 3 revealed the presence of other tRNAs (lane\n3). Thus, the electrophoresis of all fractions pooled from the chro-\nmatographic experiment indicated that the pre-miR-29 eluted in\nthe peak 2 is pure. These findings suggest that the lysine ligand\ndistinguishes and differentially interacts with several RNA species\n(Fig. 1) further suggesting a specific recognition of the pre-miR-29.\nMoreover, the pores of the lysine-support are characterized with an\nexclusion limit of >2 \u00d7 107 (?872 base pairs), allowing the access\nof sRNAs molecules (<150 nucleotides and M.W. ?4.8 \u00d7 104) to the\nimmobilized ligands at the beads surface and inside the pores. pre-\nmiR-29 presents the shape of a stem-loop consisting of two  long\nirregular double-stranded stem regions, which are interrupted by\na largely single-stranded internal loop. Along the bulge and through\nthe continuous stem sequences there are mostly guanines, which\nare described to preferentially interact with lysine [18\u201320] due to\nhydrogen bonds that are established with one of the donor atoms\nof the lysine [19]. Thus, an increased retention of pre-miRNA with\ninserts mainly constituted by guanine will be expected. Likewise,\nthe lysine amino acid has some characteristics, such as the lat-\neral side chain with significant length and ability to interact with\nseveral RNA classes even with different conformational rearrange-\nments producing good hydrogen bond geometries, which reinforce\nthe specific recognition mechanism [19]. Between multiple interac-\ntions (electrostatic interactions, van de Waals forces and hydrogen\nbonds) that the lysine can promote with the RNA backbone or with\nthe more exposed bases, several sRNAs can also be recognized by\nthe presence of hydrophobic interactions [18] with the aliphatic\n\n162\n\n\n\nP.

Moreover, the salt concentration can also have\na profound positive effect on RNA folding as well as on the stabil-\nity of non-covalent RNA\u2013amino acid interactions during the course\nof purification [19,20], once the salt allows that single-stranded\nnucleic acid molecules form stable hydrogen bonds between their\ncomplementary bases.\n\nThe  conformational stability of the pre-miR-29 secondary struc-\nture was assessed using Circular Dichroism (CD) protocol described\nby Pereira et al. [14] (data not shown). CD spectra of the pre-\nmiR-29 shows characteristic peaks around 210 (negative signal)\nand 265 nm (positive signal), which, when compared with the\nCD spectrum of established nucleic acids structures confirm that\nthe pre-miRNA possesses a stem-loop structure that is an intra-\nmolecular variant of the B-form and also contains a single-stranded\n[21]. While the CD spectra of the sRNA shows characteristic fea-\ntures of the A-RNA, a positive band around 260 nm was observed,\nand a negative signal at 220 nm,  with approximately the same\nintensity. Due to single-stranded, the duplex to stem-loop tran-\nsition is usually accompanied by CD amplitude reduction when\ncompared with sRNA spectrum. Our results demonstrate that\nisolation steps involved in the affinity procedure allowed the main-\ntenance of the pre-miRNA stability. Considering the relevance of\nobtaining pharmaceutical-grade pre-miR-29 is required further\ncharacterization of quality parameters by spectrophotometry anal-\nysis, estimating the pre-miR-29 concentration (absorbance values\nat 260 nm)  and purity (calculating the 260/280 ratio). The chro-\nmatographic process demonstrates an excellent performance in the\npre-miR-29 isolation, attaining a significant yield (11.80 \u00b1 0.50 ?g)\nin the peak 2. In addition, pre-miR-29 pure has shown 260/280\nratio of 2.00 \u00b1 0.01, which is often characteristic of a pure RNA\npreparation [10]. The protein contamination level was  assessed by\nmicro-BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) in the RNA fractions\ncollected from the chromatographic peaks. This chromatographic\nstrategy provides a reduction of protein level present in the final\npre-miR-29 samples (2.613 \u00b1 0.006 ng/?L). As it can be observed\nfrom the electrophoretic analysis of the PCR products (Fig. 2), the\nPCR reaction allowed the amplification of pre-miR-29 cDNA frag-\nments. No further amplification was seen in the control (lane C) or\nin the peaks 1 (lane 1). The control was made of PCR reaction solu-\ntions without cDNA. Therefore, it was verified that the identity of\nthe sRNA isolated from the original population was the pre-miR-29.\n\nFig. 2. pre-miR-29 identification by PCR. The agarose gel electrophoretic analysis\nof  PCR products shows amplification of pre-miR-29 cDNA fragments. Lane M,  DNA\nmolecular weight marker; lanes C, negative control; lane 1, 2 and 3 corresponding\nto  the three chromatographic peaks, respectively.\n\nThese analyses allowed the assessment of RNA quality, indi-\ncating that the developed pre-miR-29 isolation methodology can\npurify the target RNA from different RNA species with high yield,\npurity and good integrity. Thus, the present data show the develop-\nment of an AC approach based on natural occurrence interactions,\nbetween lysine and RNA species, resulting in the selective purifi-\ncation of pre-miR-29 molecules, in the required conditions for\ntherapeutic applications. These results also demonstrate the ver-\nsatility of the lysine ligand in the RNA purification, since the\npre-miRNA can be purified with (NH4)2SO4 but classes of RNAs can\nalso be separated with NaCl [12]. The successful isolation of miRNA\nspecies with high purity and quality is a step forward in RNA isola-\ntion methodologies and can widely contribute to studies in several\nRNA research fields.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis  work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for\nScience and Technology (PTDC/EBB-BIO/114320/2009, EXPL/BBB-\nBIO/1056/2012, PEst-C/SAU/UI0709/2011 and COMPETE:\n\n163\n\n\n\n132 P.

As a matter of fact, \n\nalthough pre-miR-29b was recovered with high purity, it is not compatible with clinical \n\napplications, reinforcing the need of implementing more selective methods for the \n\npurification of this biomolecule. Thus, in this paper, it is described a new affinity \n\nchromatography method using an arginine support to specifically and efficiently purify pre-\n\nmiR-29b from other small RNA species. Initially, it was characterized the behavior of pre-miR-\n\n29b under the influence of different binding/elution conditions, such as increased sodium \n\nchloride, arginine or decreased ammonium sulfate stepwise gradients, in order to achieve \n\nhigher efficiency and selectivity. The results obtained suggest that the underlying mechanism \n\ninvolves biorecognition of pre-miR-29b by the arginine ligand, resulting from the occurrence \n\nof different elementary interactions. In the elution strategies using sodium chloride or \n\narginine, an improvement in the final pre-miR-29b yields was obtained, as well as high \n\nintegrity and purity.

Introduction\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) constitute a class of small non-coding reg-\nulatory RNAs that act as key regulators of gene expression through\na highly conserved intracellular mechanism termed RNA interfer-\nence, involving the recognition and translational control of specific\nmessenger RNA (mRNA) [1]. MiRNAs are initially transcribed as\npri-miRNAs that are processed by Drosha into pre-miRNAs stem-\nloop. Pre-miRNAs are then exported to the cytoplasm, where their\nloops are removed by Dicer resulting into mature miRNAs.

Sousa).\n\nmiRNA is loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC)\ntoward the target mRNA, resulting primarily in degradation of\nmRNA transcripts or repression of protein translation, depending\non the degree of sequence complementarity [2].\n\nSeveral studies, over the last decade, have been published con-\ncerning the expression of miRNAs in patients with Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease (AD), suggesting that these can play an important role in\nthe regulation of neurodegeneration. One major hallmark of AD is\nthe generation and subsequent accumulation of ?-amyloid (A?)\nthrough sequential cleavage of the ?-amyloid precursor protein\n(APP) by ?-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and ?-secretase\n[3,4]. The regulation of the expression levels of proteins involved\nin this A? generation process has demonstrated to be important in\nAD. Hebert and collaborators showed that the miR-29 is potentially\ninvolved in the regulation of APP and BACE1/?-secretase expression\nbecause in vitro studies revealed that miR-29 cluster was signifi-\ncantly decreased in AD patients displaying abnormally high BACE1\nprotein levels [5]. These findings raised the possibility to use miR-\n29 as a potential therapeutic weapon for AD therapy.\n\nFor this reason, RNA represents an important target of a wide\ncollection of laboratory analyses, relevant, particularly, in the\n\n1570-0232/$ \u2013 see front matter \u00a9  2014 Elsevier B.V.

As\na result, RNA purification is a critical first step of a multitude of\nanalytical techniques including real-time quantitative polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR), microarray analysis, Northern blotting, in situ\nhybridization, in vitro translation and cDNA library construction [6].\nTo provide relevant and reliable results, molecular biology tech-\nniques used for such purposes require pure and intact molecules of\npurified RNA. Consequently, there is a growing demand for com-\nmercially available kits (e.g., Exiqon\u2019s, Qiagen, Ambion, Promega\nand Stratagene), which are designed to isolate miRNA molecules\nfrom different biological sources with high quality, intactness and\npurity for further analytical application or scientific need [6]. Most\nof the existing kits use either silica-based solid-phase extraction\n(SPE) technology or a magnetic-bead based extraction technol-\nogy whereby small RNAs (sRNAs) are separated from large RNAs\nthrough their capacity to bind to the column [7,8]. Furthermore,\nthere are some chromatographic methods reported in the literature\nfor the purification of the sRNA molecules from high-molecular-\nweight RNA [9\u201311] in attempting to overcome the limitations on\nRNA purification. In these methods, diverse natural or in vitro\nselected RNA aptamers sequences are inserted in RNA molecules\n[8], which subsequently have to be released from the chromato-\ngraphic support by competitive elution or cleaved off by a protease,\nwhich can affect the overall topology of the recombinant RNA con-\nstruct [12].\n\nCommonly, miRNA-based therapy applications rely on the use\nof synthetic miRNAs obtained by in vitro transcription and chemical\nsynthesis. Although these methods can be very efficient, they are\nstill expensive to be produced in large scale, limited with respect\nto the length of oligonucleotides that can be synthesized and labor\nintensive [12]. In addition, issues associated with the presence of\ncontaminants arising from synthesis still restrict the implemen-\ntation of these oligonucleotides onto clinical applications, mostly\nbecause the presence of impurities may  lead to non-targeted gene\nsilencing and are often associated with a decrease in therapeu-\ntic effectiveness. Therefore, the requirement for the production\nof highly purified and clinically suitable miRNAs in large quantity\narises as one of the most important challenges in the development\nof therapeutic strategies based on this technology.\n\nThe pursue of highly selective, reliable and economical pro-\ncesses capable of preparing therapeutic biomolecules with the\nstrict quality assurance has been accompanied by an improve-\nment in the downstream strategies that are based on affinity\nchromatography (AC) [13]. Thus, the development of an affinity-\nbased methodology using amino acids as specific ligands have\nrecently led to an improvement in purification technologies, since\nthis technique exploits natural biological processes such as molec-\nular recognition for the selective purification of target biomolecules\n[14\u201318].\n\nHence, the main goal of this work is to develop new method-\nologies for the RNA isolation that enable the pre-miR-29 recovery\nwith high integrity and purity, in view of the application in molec-\nular biology procedures, namely for gene expression analysis. To\naccomplish this purpose, it was explored the possibility of using\narginine-AC to selectively isolate the pre-miRNA from Rhodovu-\nlum sulfidophilum. This bacteria was selected as recombinant host\nto biosynthesize the pre-miR-29, once it does not produce any\ndetectable ribonucleases (RNases) in the culture medium, main-\ntaining the stability of the RNA produced [19]. Thus, this fact\nconstitutes a great advantage since RNA is an instable molecule due\nto its susceptibility to nucleases mediated degradation. The method\nbased on arginine-AC can be an attractive approach for the miRNA\npurification process, since previous results from our research group\nhave demonstrated the potential of this amino acid in the purifi-\ncation of RNA [20] and plasmid DNA [21\u201323], suggesting that the\nbinding mechanism involves phenomenological interactions like\n\nbiorecognition between arginine and nucleic acids. In addition,\narginine was chosen because it is a conserved amino acid in the\nactive center of the Argonaute protein [24], which is part of the\nRISC complex. The binding/elution behavior of pre-miR-29 under\nthe influence of different environmental conditions, such as the\ncomposition, the ionic strength of the elution buffer, and the tem-\nperature were investigated. The study revealed several interesting\ncharacteristics of RNA molecules, including their chromatographic\nbehavior and natural interactions that can occur between the argi-\nnine support and pre-miRNA. These results support the interest in\napplying amino acid-based AC to develop new pre-miRNA isolation\nand purification processes. Therefore, this new affinity protocol for\nmiRNA isolation can offer advantages over other less-selective and\ntime-consuming multistep procedures and can improve process\neconomics. Moreover, some improvements over other chromato-\ngraphic techniques are expected because RNA recovery can be\nachieved under mild elution conditions, suggesting the feasibility\nof exploiting different affinity interactions between amino acids\nand miRNA to develop an interesting bioseparation methodology.\n\n2.  Materials and methods\n\n2.1.  Materials\n\nArginine\u2013Sepharose 4B gel was  acquired from Amersham Bio-\nsciences, the guanidinium salt and all the chemicals used in the\nlysis buffer were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Other compounds\nused in the elution buffer were ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4)\nand sodium chloride (NaCl) purchased from Panreac and Tris from\nMerck. All solutions were freshly prepared using 0.05% diethyl\npyrocarbonate (DEPC; Sigma-Aldrich) treated water and the elu-\ntion buffers were filtered through a 0.20 ?m pore size membrane\nand degassed ultrasonically. The DNA molecular weight marker\nwas obtained from Vivantis Technologies. All the materials used\nin the experiments were RNase-free.\n\n2.2. Bacterial strain and growth conditions\n\nThe pre-miR-29 used in this study was  obtained from a cell\nculture of R. sulfidophilum DSM 1374 strain (BCCM/LMG, Belgium)\nmodified with plasmid pBHSR1-RM [19] containing the sequence\nof pre-miR-29. Growth was carried out in shaker flasks containing\n100 mL  of Nutrient Broth medium (g per liter of deionized water:\nbeef extract, 1; yeast extract, 2; peptone, 5 and sodium chloride, 5)\nsupplemented with 30 ?g/mL kanamycin in a rotary shaker at 30 ?C\nand 250 rpm under dark-aerobic conditions. Cell growth was  eval-\nuated by measuring the optical density of the culture medium at\na wavelength of 600 nm after dispersing cell flocs by vortexing for\n30 s. Cells were recovered by centrifugation and stored at ?20 ?C.\n\n2.3. Lysis and small RNA isolation\n\nCells were lyzed and sRNA was extracted using the acid\nguanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method based on the\nprotocol described by Chomczynski and co-workers [25]. Bacterial\npellets were resuspended in 5 mL  of denaturing cell lysis solu-\ntion (4 M guanidinium thiocyanate; 25 mM  sodium citrate, pH 4.0;\n0.5% (m/v) N-laurosylsarcosine and 0.1 M ?-mercaptoethanol) to\nperform lysis. After incubating on ice for 10 min, cellular debris,\ngenomic DNA and proteins were precipitated by gently adding\nand mixing 5 mL  of water-saturated phenol and 0.5 mL of 2 M\nsodium acetate (pH 4.0). The sRNA isolation was  achieved by adding\n1 mL  of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (49:1), and by mixing vig-\norously until two  immiscible phases were obtained. The upper\naqueous phase, which contained mostly RNA, was recovered and\n\n168\n\n\n\n18 P. Pereira et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 951\u2013 952 (2014) 16\u2013 23\n\nconcentrated by the addition of 5 mL  of ice-cold isopropanol. Pre-\ncipitated molecules were recovered by centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g,\nfor 20 min, at 4 ?C and resuspended in 1.5 mL  of lysis solution.\nMolecules were concentrated again with 1.5 mL  of ice-cold iso-\npropanol. After centrifuging for 10 min, at 10,000 \u00d7 g (4 ?C), the\nsRNA pellet was washed with 7.5 mL  of 75% ethanol and incubated\nat room temperature for 10 min, followed by a 5 min  centrifugation\nat 10 000 g (4 ?C). The air-dried sRNA pellet was solubilized in 1 mL\nof 0.05% DEPC-treated water. Finally, 260 and 280 nm absorbance\nof the samples was measured using Nanodrop spectrophotometer\nin order to assess sRNA quantity and purity.\n\n2.4. Affinity chromatography\n\nChromatography was performed in an \u00c4KTA Avant system with\nUNICORN 6 software (GE Healthcare). A 10 mm diameter \u00d7 20 mm\nlong (about 2 mL)  column was packed with commercial L-\narginine\u2013Sepharose 4B gel. This support is characterized by the\nmanufacturer as a cross-linked 4% beaded agarose matrix with a 12-\natom spacer and an extent of labeling between 14 and 20 ?moL/mL.\npre-miR-29 was purified applying three elution strategies, namely\nby using NaCl, (NH4)2SO4 and arginine as competition agent. In the\nexperiments with sodium chloride, after washing out the unbound\nmaterial with 280 mM NaCl in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0), the ionic\nstrength of the buffer was stepwise increased to 360 and 500 mM\nNaCl in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). On the other hand, in the exper-\niments with ammonium sulfate, the column was equilibrated with\n2.0 M of (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). After the elution\nof unbound species with this condition, the ionic strength of the\nbuffer was stepwise decreased to 1.55 M (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM Tris\nbuffer (pH 8.0). Finally, tightly bound sRNA species were removed\nby changing the ionic strength to 100 mM of (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM\nTris buffer (pH 8.0). The experiments performed with arginine to\npurify pre-miR-29 molecules were initiated with the equilibra-\ntion of the column with 280 mM NaCl in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH\n8.0) to promote the total retention of pre-miR-29 and then the\nelution was accomplished by changing to 280 mM NaCl supple-\nmented with 25 mM arginine in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The\nmost retained species were finally eluted with 500 mM NaCl. In the\nthree sets of experiments, sRNAs samples (30 ?g) were injected\nonto the column using a 100 ?L loop at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min,\nwhich contains 6S RNA, pre-miR-29 and other sRNA, including\ntransfer RNAs. The absorbance of the eluate was continuously mon-\nitored at 260 nm.  All experiments were performed at 20 ?C using a\ncirculating water bath. Fractions were pooled according to the chro-\nmatograms obtained, and following concentration and desalting\nwith Vivaspin concentrators, the pools were kept for quantification\nand further analysis.\n\n2.5.  Polyacrylamide electrophoresis\n\nFractions  recovered from the sRNA chromatographic exper-\niment were also analyzed by vertical electrophoresis using an\nAmersham Biosciences system (GE Healthcare) with 10% polyac-\nrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 125 V for 90 min\nwith TBE buffer. sRNA samples were previously denatured with\n97.5% formamide and denatured conditions were kept in the gel\nowing to the presence of 8 M urea. sRNA molecules were stained\nwith ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/mL).\n\n2.6. Protein analysis\n\nProtein  residual contamination in pre-miR-29 samples collected\nfrom the purification with arginine-agarose support, was mea-\nsured by using the micro-BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.),\naccording to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Briefly, the calibration\n\ncurve  was  prepared using BSA standards (0.01\u20130.25 mg/mL). A total\nof 25 ?L of each standard or pre-miR-29 samples were added to\n200 ?L of BCA reagent in a microplate and incubated for 30 min\nat 60 ?C. The absorbance was  measured at 570 nm in a microplate\nreader.\n\n2.7. PCR analysis\n\nPre-miR-29 identification was assessed using polymerase chain\nreaction (PCR) (Biometra). cDNAs synthesis was  performed using\nRevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scien-\ntific Inc.), according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A total of 0.5 ?g\nof RNA samples collected after the chromatographic purification\nprocess with arginine\u2013agarose column was  used to initiate cDNA\nsynthesis, which was  denatured for 5 min  at 65 ?C with 20 pmol\nof gene-specific primer (Supplementary data). Then, PCR reactions\nwere carried out using 1 ?L of synthesized cDNAs in a 25 ?L reac-\ntion containing 0.125 U of Supreme DNA polymerase (NZYtech),\n50 mM of magnesium chloride (NZYtech) and 150 nM of each\nprimer. Specific primers for cDNA, whose design was based on a\nRNA database, were used to amplify a fragment of 145 bp (Supple-\nmentary data). The PCR program was  carried out as follows: after an\ninitial denaturation at 95 ?C for 5 min, 40 cycles consisting of dena-\nturation at 95 ?C for 30 s, annealing at 63 ?C for 30 s and extension\nat 72 ?C for 15 s, and a final elongation step at 72 ?C for 5 min. To\nconfirm the presence and purity of amplicons, PCR products were\nanalyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis (120 V for 35 min) in\nTAE buffer in the presence of 0.5 ?g/mL greensafe (NZYtech).\n\n3.  Results\n\n3.1. Effect of ionic strength, elution buffer composition and\ntemperature on pre-miR-29 binding\n\nThis study was developed to explore the phenomenological\ninteractions like biorecognition between pre-miR-29 and arginine\nas a biospecific ligand in AC. In order to establish our method, we\nchanged the elution buffer composition and ionic strength or the\nexperimental temperature and, therefore, evaluated different kinds\nof interactions between the biospecific ligand and the pre-miR-29.\nSince RNA is negatively charged due to the phosphate groups in the\nbackbone, it is easy to predict favorable electrostatic interactions\nbetween RNA phosphate groups and arginine ligands. However,\ndepending on environmental conditions used, some interactions\ncan be more preferential than other, becoming more evident under\nspecific conditions.\n\nIn  the studies performed to mainly favor ionic interactions, after\nbinding, the pre-miR-29 elution was  achieved with the application\nof a stepwise gradient increasing the NaCl concentration to 280,\n360 and 500 mM,  after several optimizations. This strategy is based\non previously studied elution pattern of plasmid DNA, in the NaCl\nconcentration range of 200\u2013300 mM,  described by our research\ngroup [23]. In addition, the potential application of arginine-based\nchromatography to purify total RNA directly from a clarified lysate\nhas been recently described also by our group [20]. In this case,\narginine ligands were able to distinguish and, therefore, interacted\ndifferentially with various sRNAs molecules, suggesting a specific\nrecognition for the pre-miR-29. During these experiments, there\nwas a need to strictly control the chromatographic conditions in\norder to maintain the reproducibility, since a slightly variation in\nconductivity (salt concentration and/or temperature) affected the\nsRNA retention. The chromatographic assays initially performed\nwere intended to test the ionic strength effect on sRNA retention.\nTherefore, Fig. 1A shows the chromatographic profile obtained after\nthe injection of sRNA preparation in the arginine-agarose support.\n\n169\n\n\n\nP.

(A) Chromatographic profile of the pre-miR-29 purification from a sRNA mixture extract by arginine\u2013agarose chromatography. Elution was  performed at 1.0 mL/min\nby  stepwise increasing NaCl concentration in the eluent from 280, 360 and 500 mM,  as represented by the arrows. (B) Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of samples collected\nat  the column outlet. Fractions corresponding to peaks (1), (2) and (3) are shown in lanes 1-3, respectively. Lane S, impure sRNA preparation injected onto the column.\n\nThe chromatographic run was initiated at low ionic strength with\n280 mM NaCl in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). Under these condi-\ntions, a first peak of unbound species was obtained. As shown in\nFig. 1A, the pre-miR-29 was obtained when the elution step was\nperformed with 360 mM NaCl, being recovered nearly 96.5% of pre-\nmiR-29. The elution of highly bound species was then achieved by\nincreasing the ionic strength of the buffer to 500 mM NaCl. The\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to detect and identify\ndifferent RNAs species eluting in each peak (Fig. 1B). In Fig. 1B, the\nelectrophoretic profile presented in lanes 1, 2 and 3 corresponds to\nthe samples pooled from the respective peaks in the chromatogram.\nHence, the electrophoretic analysis showed that the first peak of\nunbound species corresponds to the elution of transfer RNA (tRNA)\nspecies (Fig. 1B, lane 1), while the second peak mainly refers to\npre-miR-29 (Fig. 1B, lane 2) and, finally, the third peak mainly\nrefers to 6S RNA and tRNA species (Fig. 1B, lane 3). These results\nsuggest that pre-miR-29 presents a stronger interaction with the\narginine matrix than the majority of tRNA species. The salt con-\ncentration (360 mM NaCl) needed to elute bound pre-miR-29 from\narginine\u2013agarose matrix (Fig. 1A) is considerably lower than those\ntypically used in different chromatographic techniques, namely in\nanion-exchange chromatographic supports (higher than 500 mM\nNaCl) [22] which is an important process advantage.\n\nIn order to mainly exploit hydrophobic interactions, a\ndecreasing ammonium sulfate stepwise gradient between 2 and\n0.1 M was applied, allowing pre-miR-29 separation. The retention\nbehavior of sRNA molecules in this strategy is in accordance with\nthe results previously described to purify total RNA directly from\na clarified lysate [16] or to isolate 6S RNA from a sRNA mixture\n[17] using histidine as ligand. Fig. 2A shows the chromatographic\nprofile obtained after injection of the sRNA sample. The presence of\ndifferent peaks in the chromatogram indicates that RNAs present in\nthe sRNA population interact differently with the arginine\u2013agarose\nsupport. The higher salt concentration promoted total pre-miR-29\nretention. It was observed that tRNA molecules eluted immediately\nwith 1.55 M (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The elution\nof pre-miR-29 was achieved with 1.1 M (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM Tris\nbuffer (pH 8.0). These results were important to understand the\nbinding behavior of the sRNA mixture and to develop the best\npurification strategy for pre-miR-29. In fact, the higher salt con-\ncentration plays a key role on the pre-miR-29 binding to arginine\n\nligand.  Again, a polyacrylamide electrophoresis was used to detect\nand identify different species eluting in each chromatographic peak\n(Fig. 2B).\n\nThe  electrophoretic analysis indicates that the first chromato-\ngraphic peak (Fig. 2A, peak 1) corresponds to the elution of tRNA\n(Fig. 2B, lane 1). However, the elution of pre-miR-29 was  mainly\nachieved in the second peak, following the reduction of the ionic\nstrength of the elution buffer (peak 2 and lane 2). Finally, the\n6S RNA, pre-miR-29 and other tRNAs species were eluted with\n100 mM (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0), as it was observed\nin the third chromatographic peak (peak 3 and lane 3).\n\nAfter  identifying the pre-miR-29 retention behavior on the argi-\nnine matrix with both elution strategies addressed in this study\n(NaCl and (NH4)2SO4)), the temperature effect on pre-miR-29\nstability was also evaluated. In fact, this parameter could also\nsignificantly influence pre-miR-29 interactions with the immobi-\nlized arginine. Thus, several chromatographic experiments were\ndesigned to analyze how the temperature affects the adsorp-\ntion of pre-miR-29, as well as the other R. sulfidophilum sRNA\nspecies. Therefore, the water-jacketed column was  connected to\na circulating water bath to maintain the appropriate temperature\n(temperature extremes, 4 and 20 ?C) in each experiment. As a mat-\nter of fact, the results showed an increased retention of all sRNAs\nspecies studied with the temperature increase, suggesting that\nhigher temperatures favors the involvement of hydrophobic inter-\nactions [26]. This stronger interaction might be due to the fact that\nbases of the tRNAs are more available to interact with immobilized\nligands, because of its single-stranded structure. On the other hand,\nthe pre-miR-29 shows low binding affinity since it has a structure\nstem-loop. Moreover, for the lowest temperature studied (4 ?C), it\nis observed that the isolated pre-miR-29 retention time is similar\nto that from the isolated tRNAs (data not shown).\n\nIn AC, the elution of a target solute that is bound to the affinity\nligands can be achieved through addition of a competing agent in\nthe elution buffer rather than changing the ionic strength, pH, or\npolarity. Moreover, this methodology is also commonly employed\nin order to make the elution strategy more selective and biospecific\nas well as to get higher elution efficiency. The competing agent can\nbind to the retained target or to the immobilized ligand, depending\nof their characteristics, thus allowing to predict the interactions\nthat can be involved. In this work, competitive studies were\n\n170\n\n\n\n20 P. Pereira et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 951\u2013 952 (2014) 16\u2013 23\n\nFig. 2.

Elution was performed at 1 mL/min by\nstepwise decreasing (NH4 )2 SO4 concentration in the eluent from 2 to 0.1 M (NH4 )2 SO4 in 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 8.0). (B) Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of\nsamples collected at the column outlet. Fractions corresponding to peaks (1), (2) and (3) are shown in lanes 1\u20133, respectively. Lane S, impure sRNA sample injected onto the\ncolumn.\n\nperformed by adding 250 mM of arginine to the elution buffer in\na stepwise gradient, to exploit specific elution of pre-miR-29 from\nthe column and therefore to evaluate the possibility of reaching\nhigher purification factors, according to the procedure described\nby Sousa and co-workers for the purification of plasmid DNA [23].\nThe elution gradients applied were adapted to ensure that the\nRNA sample is on ideal conditions to bind to the matrix ligands,\nand to elute only due to the competing agent addition. Thus, the\ncharacterization of binding/elution behavior of pre-miR-29 in the\narginine\u2013agarose matrix upon addition of arginine is essential. The\narginine column was first equilibrated with 280 mM NaCl in 10 mM\nTris buffer (pH 8.0) to promote the total retention of pre-miR-29.\nAfter sample binding, elution could be carried out by increasing\nthe ionic strength upon NaCl addition. The chromatographic pro-\nfile presented in Fig. 3A gives an interesting suggestion about the\nnature of interactions involved in the pre-miR-29 retention to\narginine\u2013agarose matrix. Fig. 3A shows the result obtained in an\nexperiment in which pre-miR-29 was first bound to the column\nwith 280 mM NaCl and then eluted by changing to a 280 mM NaCl\nsupplemented with 25 mM arginine (positively charged). In fact,\n\npre-miR-29  recovery was  only achieved when the elution buffer\ncontaining the arginine amino acid was  applied. Summarizing, from\nthe results obtained with this first screening of the pre-miR-29\nretention pattern in arginine-based matrix (Fig. 3), it was found that\nthe pre-miR-29 presents a great ability to bind to the matrix, sug-\ngesting the establishment of a strong interaction with the support.\nHowever, the elution is not difficult to perform and the pre-miR-29\nrecovery is achieved by using low salt or arginine concentrations.\nSome experiments were also carried out using other concentra-\ntions, from 5 to 30 mM of arginine in the elution buffer but all of\nthe tRNAs species were eluted together with pre-miR-29 (results\nnot shown).\n\n3.2. Pre-miR-29 quality characterization\n\nTo ensure the success of the purification methodologies here\ndescribed, the quality of pre-miRNA preparations was assessed\nusing parameters that are commonly considered, namely spec-\ntrophotometry analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and\ntotal protein quantification [27,28]. Since, the RNA preparations\n\nFig. 3. (A) Separation of pre-miR-29 by arginine\u2013agarose chromatography.

The spectrophotometry analysis allows the esti-\nmation of RNA concentration using the absorbance values at 260\nand 280 nm,  while the purity of each sample was evaluated by\ncalculating the 260/280 ratio. Thus, a ratio of 2.00 \u00b1 0.01 is often\ncharacteristic of a pure RNA preparation [27]. However, the pro-\ntein content is a common impurity in RNA preparations that usually\ncan be omitted in spectrophotometry analysis since it is required\na relatively large amount of protein contamination to significantly\naffect the 260/280 ratio in an RNA solution [27]. Thus, the total pro-\ntein content was assessed by micro-BCA assay in the RNA fractions\ncollected from the chromatographic peaks. As a result, the protein\ncontamination level was  negligible in pre-miR-29 samples (Peak 2\nin Fig. 1A, 2A and 3A). The analysis of protein content in the frac-\ntions collected along the pre-miR-29 purification gradient revealed\nthat proteins tend to elute more in the first chromatographic steps\n(data not shown). Therefore, the chromatographic strategies used\nin these new pre-miRNA isolation methods also provide a reduction\nof protein contamination in RNA samples, specifically in the com-\npetition studies where the proteins were not detected (as shown\nin Table 1).\n\nMoreover, the electrophoretic analysis (Fig. 1B, 2B and 3B) is an\nimportant complementary technique that enables the assessment\nof RNA integrity. RNA is one of the most difficult materials to sepa-\nrate under chromatographic conditions because it is degraded very\nquickly in nature and its stabilization is very difficult. Hence, the\nfinal RNA integrity is a key factor for the overall success and fur-\nther application and will depend on maintaining the stability of the\nsample before separation, throughout the purification process, and\nalso during the recovery of RNA fractions when the separation has\nbeen completed. The results demonstrate that the isolation steps\ninvolved in the affinity procedure allowed maintaining the pre-\nmiR-29 stability (chemically intact and biologically competent).\nThe application of arginine AC can also be strongly associated with\nthe preserved integrity observed in RNA samples since arginine,\nowing to its multiplicity of interactions, has been largely associated\nwith stabilizing effects on RNA conformations [26,30,31]. More-\nover, electrophoretic analysis allows the visualization of the several\nsRNA species of a sample in which RNA bands are sharp and clear\nwith a characteristic banding profile, which is crucial to guarantee\nRNA quality.\n\nThe  Phoretix 1D software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle,\nUnited Kingdom) was also used as an auxiliary of the electrophore-\nsis polyacrylamide analysis, allowing to control the purity of\npre-miR-29 preparations and to determine the yield through the\nevaluation of the intensity of electrophoresis bands. The quan-\ntitative analysis of pre-miR-29 purity throughout the isolation\nprocedure is summarized in Table 1 that presents the concentration\nof sRNA samples, which were applied in arginine chromatogra-\nphy. Thus, the quality control analysis revealed a high purity (90%)\nin the final pre-miR-29 RNA preparations obtained with the NaCl\nelution strategy. Moreover, in the arginine and (NH4)2SO4 elution\nstrategies, they were obtained the following purities 98 and 33%,\nrespectively. The chromatographic process demonstrates an excel-\nlent performance in the isolation of pre-miR-29, attaining a higher\npre-miR-29 yield with the NaCl strategy (96.5%) and a significant\nrecovery with (NH4)2SO4 (52.8%) as well as in the competition\n\nstudies (56.7%), beginning with 30 ?g of sRNA (see Table 1). A more\naccurate identification of pre-miR-29 molecules purified from the\nsRNA populations with the arginine\u2013agarose matrix was performed\nby PCR. As it can be observed from the electrophoretic analysis of\nthe PCR products (Fig. 4), by using specific primers for pre-miR-29\ncDNA, the PCR reaction allowed the amplification of pre-miR-29. No\nfurther amplification was  seen in the control (lane 1). The negative\ncontrol was made of PCR reaction solutions without cDNA. There-\nfore, it was verified that the identity of the sRNA isolated from the\noriginal population was the pre-miR-29.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nIn this work, we describe an alternative method to purify miRNA\nfrom a complex mixture of total RNA based in the AC, which is\nthe unique technique that simulates and exploits biological inter-\nactions allowing the separation of biomolecules on the basis of a\nspecific and reversible contact between the target biomolecules\nand the specific ligand, which is coupled to a chromatographic\nmatrix  [13]. The choice of the matrix and elution conditions to be\nused will depend on molecular properties of biomolecules and the\nphysicochemical and thermodynamic nature of their molecular\ninteractions [32]. As previously mentioned, elution steps can\nbe performed either specifically, using a competitive ligand, or\nnon-specifically, by changing the pH, ionic strength or polarity\nof the buffer depending on the matrix used and the chemical\ncharacteristics of biomolecules [32]. Our choice was  the arginine\namino acid because it is considered an excellent ligand since it\npresents several characteristics that allow the establishment of\nmultiple interactions between itself and nucleic acid molecules,\nnamely its ability to interact in different conformations, the length\nof its side chain and its ability to produce good hydrogen bond\ngeometries [33]. Furthermore, recent studies emphasized that\narginine can be studied as a ligand in AC for RNA purification,\nsince this amino acid is conserved in the active center of the\nPAZ domains of the Argonaute proteins, suggesting that they\nhave an important role in the specific recognition of the 3? over-\nhang of the pre-miRNA after which occurs the degradation of the\n\nFig. 4. pre-miR-29 identification by reverse-transcription PCR.

Pereira et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 951\u2013 952 (2014) 16\u2013 23\n\nmRNA [24]. The sequence of pre-miR-29 was sought in the miRBase\n(http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/mirna entry.pl?acc=MI0000105)\nthat is the official repository of miRNAs, where known miRNAs\nare named and stored. However, pre-miRNAs are not described\nfor real sequences, since the predicted stem-loop sequences in\nthe database are not strictly pre-miRNAs, but rather include\nthe pre-miRNA and some flanking sequence from the presumed\nprimary transcript. In this study it was chosen to produce a\npre-miRNA instead of the mature miRNA, because of its structural\ncharacteristics, specifically the single chain with ?100 nt of which\nsome are unpaired in the 3? overhang, which will possibly facilitate\nthe purification [34].\n\nIn  fact, beyond the potential application of arginine-based\nchromatography to purify pre-miR-29 from R. sulfidophilum sRNA\nmixture described here, this study also demonstrates the possibility\nof using three different strategies to conduct the pre-miRNA purifi-\ncation. This advantageous methodology reduced the complexity of\nthe general procedure, and examined the applications and selec-\ntivity that these elution strategies can have in promote under\ndifferent environmental conditions. Thus, this purification could\nbe achieved either using an increased NaCl (360 mM),  decreased\n(NH4)2SO4 (1.1 M)  or arginine (25 mM)  stepwise gradients. Com-\nparing the two best elution strategies, using NaCl or arginine to\nelute bound pre-miR-29 biomolecules, it was verified that the\narginine concentration needed to promote elution is lower than\nthe NaCl concentrations. This fact is in accordance with what has\nbeen previously described by other authors, because as arginine\nis monovalent at the pH used, it is equivalent to NaCl in terms of\nvalency; however the conductivity is much lower than for NaCl at\nidentical concentrations [35]. The lower concentration of arginine\nsuggests that its effectiveness is due to other factors than electro-\nstatic effects, involving affinity interactions, although whether the\nlower conductivity of arginine plays any role in effectiveness as\nan eluent is not clear [35]. Moreover, this behavior can be due to\nthe positive character of this amino acid that promotes a preferen-\ntial binding of pre-miR-29 to free arginine present in the buffer by\nelectrostatic interactions, inducing its elution. In a general way, the\ncompetition study has shown that the free arginine present in the\nelution buffer could interact with the pre-miR-29, promoting its\nbiospecific elution of the arginine column, due to the competition\nwith the ligand.\n\nIn  a general point of view, the strategy with NaCl showed to\nbe ideal for pre-miR-29 purification using a low salt concentra-\ntion (90% of purity and 96.5% of yield), whereas the strategy with\n(NH4)2SO4 requires high salt concentrations to partially purify pre-\nmiR-29 (33% of purity). On the other hand, the competition studies\nalso demonstrated the possibility of purifying pre-miR-29 with\nhigher purity (98% of purity and 56.7% of yield) when compared\nwith other strategies, even though some pre-miRNA is lost in the\nnext elution step. Thus, if larger amounts of pure pre-miRNA are\ndesired, the strategy that employs NaCl can be used, while if higher\npurity levels are necessary, the competition strategy is more appro-\npriate. Hence, this comparative study brings more evidences that\nthe binding mechanism inherent on the biorecognition between\nthe arginine amino acid and pre-miR-29 molecules, can result from\nthe combination of several phenomenological interactions such\nas electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, (multiple)\nhydrogen bond interactions, van der Waals forces, dipole\u2013dipole\nforces, cation\u2013? interactions, etc. [36]. However, depending on\nenvironmental conditions established and the amino acid ligands\nused, some interactions can be more favored than other, becoming\nmore evident under these conditions. In fact, in some molecular\nrecognition studies, arginine is reported as a preferential amino\nacid to contact with RNA, when the overall negative charge of\nRNA is considered [36,37]. Additionally, recent studies with satura-\ntion transfer difference-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy\n\nand surface plasmon resonance biosensor reported that adenine,\ncytosine, and guanine polynucleotides bind to arginine\u2013agarose\nsupport mainly through the sugar-phosphate backbone [38,39].\nAccording to the authors, the negative charge of the biomolecules\nis important for their interaction with arginine-agarose, nonethe-\nless the base exposure on RNA species was also suggested to have\na crucial role in nucleic acid retention [22,23]. Furthermore, the\nstructural diversity of RNAs was  recently described to be of sig-\nnificant importance in protein\u2013RNA interactions because RNA can\nexhibit different moieties according to its folding state [40]. Hence,\npre-miR-29 structural features seem to be relevant on its distinct\nretention behavior with the arginine\u2013agarose matrix. The main\nexplanation for the specific interactions occurring between the pre-\nmiR-29 and the immobilized arginine is the single-stranded nature\nof RNA, which is normally involved in RNA recognition, due to the\nhigh base exposure and availability for interactions. Pre-miR-29\nis a sRNA molecule in the shape of a stem-loop or hairpin con-\nsisting of two long irregular double-stranded stem regions, which\nare interrupted by a largely single-stranded internal loop. Along\nthe bulge and through the continuous stem sequences there are\nmostly guanines, which were described to interact preferably with\narginine [13]. Moreover, the arginine support has shown the ability\nto interact with all RNA classes even with different conformational\nrearrangements [31]. The multiposition interaction of arginine with\nRNA sites [26,41] can explain this result. This phenomenon can\noccur because arginine has two different polar centers with which\nRNA can strongly associate: at ?-carbon group and the guanidinium\nside chain [36]. Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that the reten-\ntion of all functional classes of RNA in arginine\u2013agarose matrix is\ndue to arginine side chain, which can promote multicontacts with\nRNA backbone or RNA bases, according to RNA folding. Overall, it\nis suggested that although electrostatic interactions could play an\nimportant role on RNA retention, the base contact is also involved\nand modulate some favored interaction and specificity found in\narginine\u2013agarose chromatography.\n\nPrevious  analysis allowed the assessment of RNA quality, indi-\ncating that the developed pre-miR-29 isolation methodology can\npurify the target RNA of different RNA species with high recovery\nyield, purity and good integrity. In a single step, arginine affinity\nchromatography offered the pre-miRNA purification from a com-\nplex biological mixture, making use of low salt concentrations,\nrather than organic or toxic compounds, and the use of enzymes\nis not necessary. The chemical lysis with guanidinium buffers used\nin this method is extensively described in literature for RNA extrac-\ntion, including in many commercial kit and reagents, with no\nsignificant implications in downstream applications. In conclusion,\nthe present data shows the development of an affinity chromatog-\nraphy approach based on natural occurrence interactions, between\narginine and RNA species, aiming the purification of pre-miR-29\nmolecules. The exploitation of these affinity interactions can trigger\nnew insights not only in isolation strategies but also in many other\nRNA research fields owing to its implication in molecular recogni-\ntion phenomena. The successful results obtained with this support\nreveal an efficient technique to obtain a reproducible and appro-\npriate RNA quality with potential applicability for RNA structural\nand functional studies and gene therapy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was  supported by the Portuguese Foundation for\nScience and Technology (PTDC/EBB-BIO/114320/2009, EXPL/BBB-\nBIO/1056/2012, COMPETE: FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-027560 and\nPest-C/SAU/UI0709/2011).

The  pre-miR-29  deficiency  or overexpression  has  been  associated  to  a  number  of clini-\ncally  important  diseases,  and  its therapeutic  application  can  be considered.

Introduction\n\nIn the past decade, countless species of non-coding RNA, namely\nribosomal RNA (rRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA) and a range of smaller\nlike microRNA (miRNA) molecules, have been discovered and\ndeeply studied. Of these, miRNAs molecules attract particular inter-\nest due to their essential roles in most cellular processes, as\npotential biomarkers and drug targets [1,2]. For this reason, RNA\nrepresents an important target of a wide range of laboratory analy-\nsis, being particularly relevant in the diagnosis of several disorders,\nas well as in basic and applied research. Hence, RNA quality and\n\n? Corresponding author at: Centro de Investigac? \u00e3o em Ci\u00eancias da Sa\u00fade, Univer-\nsidade  da Beira Interior, Avenida Infante D.

Thereby, RNA purification is impor-\ntant to achieve pure, stable and intact RNA, free from contaminants,\nincluding genomic DNA, proteins and organic solvents, once these\nimpurities greatly affect the pharmaceutical and clinical applica-\ntions [3,4]. This fact greatly contributes to the need to develop novel\nmethods for the rapid and inexpensive isolation and purification of\nmicroRNAs.\n\nRNA is an unstable molecule and has a very short half-life\nonce extracted due to the ubiquitous presence of RNA-degrading\nenzymes (RNases) which are present in biological samples, aque-\nous buffers, on labware and can be introduced via human handling\n[5]. To overcome the problems associated with RNA isolation, sev-\neral strategies are available to isolate and purify miRNA molecules\nchemically synthesized or derived from various biological sources\n[3,6]. The purification of RNA molecules is already reported by using\npreparative denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE),\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2014.09.080\n0021-9673/\u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V.

These methods make use of enzymes and\nstructural modifications in the RNA molecule by the introduction\nof tags sequences, which can affect the overall topology of the RNA.\nIn addition, the application of this methodology and RNA modifi-\ncations is typically limited to sRNAs, smaller than 40 nucleotides\n[4,12,13]. Overall, and although these purification methods can be\nvery efficient for the recovery of RNA with high quality and quan-\ntity, they still are expensive on large scale, labor intensive and only\nallow the separation of small RNAs (sRNAs) from rRNA. In addition,\nin most cases the isolation of pure RNA is achieved by a secondary\nenrichment, either through enzymatic removal of DNA or by a sec-\nond set of columns specific to miRNA [14].\n\nIn the last years, our research group developed a new affinity\nchromatography approach, named amino acid-affinity chromatog-\nraphy to efficiently purify different RNA species (total RNA, rRNA,\nsRNA and 6S RNA) [15\u201317]. This powerful technique is based on\nthe application of amino acids as specific ligands to purify RNA on\nthe basis of their biological function or individual chemical struc-\nture [18]. More recently, lysine, tyrosine and arginine amino acids\nhave been successfully applied as affinity ligands for microRNAs\npurification, particularly in pre-miR-29 isolation, in conventional\nparticle-based columns [19\u201321]. Amino acid ligands described\nabove showed high selectivity, however a faster and more robust\npurification method is required due to the structural characteristics\nof the RNA molecule, including their stability. Monolithic supports\nhave been largely explored in recent years for the separation of\nlarge biomolecules owing to their structural properties compared\nwith conventional columns, namely high binding capacity, excel-\nlent mass transfer properties and a huge quantity of accessible\nbinding sites [22,23]. Moreover, monoliths allow a very fast sepa-\nration and purification with high reproducibility both at small and\nlarge scales, support higher flow rates and reduced biomolecules\ndegradation due to the shorter contact times with the chromato-\ngraphic matrix [24].\n\nThis  work has the purpose of exploring the possibility of using\nagmatine amino acid derivative as ligand, combined with the\nmulti-functionality of the monolithic support [25\u201327] to selec-\ntively isolate the pre-miRNA from the recombinant Rhodovulum\nsulfidophilum host. Knowing that an agarose based matrix with\nimmobilized arginine amino acid allows an efficient separation\nof pre-miR-29 [21], it becomes interesting to study a new mono-\nlith with agmatine immobilized. Agmatine is a neurotransmitter\nderived from the decarboxylation of arginine and plays the role\nof agonist or antagonist of different enzymes involved in several\nbiological mechanisms [28\u201330]. This study demonstrates for the\nfirst time, the use of this amino acid derivative as a chromato-\ngraphic ligand to purify microRNA. In this way, the aim of the\npresent study is to develop new methodologies for RNA isolation,\nenabling the pre-miRNA-29 purification with high integrity and\npurity using monoliths, in view of the application in molecular\nbiology or therapeutic procedures in a short time. Additional chro-\nmatographic characterization based on breakthrough experiments\nis also designed to study the dynamic binding capacity for RNA. The\nbinding behavior of pre-miR-29 under the influence of different\nenvironmental conditions, such as the elution buffer composition,\nor using different flow-rates is also investigated.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\n2.1.  Materials\n\nAll  buffers used for the chromatographic experiments were\nfreshly prepared with sterilized water pre-treated with 0.05%\ndiethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC; Sigma\u2013Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA),\n\nfiltered  through a 0.20 ?m pore size membrane (Schleicher Schuell,\nDassel, Germany) and degassed ultrasonically. The ammonium sul-\nfate and sodium chloride salts used in these buffers were purchased\nto Panreac (Barcelona, Spain), tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane\n(Tris) to Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and agmatine sulfate was\nfrom Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,  USA). Chromatographic exper-\niments were carried out in the 0.34 mL  bed volume (average pore\nsize of 1500 nm in diameter) carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) monolith\nmodified with agmatine amino acid derivative, kindly provided\nby BIA Separations (Ajdovs?c?ina,  Slovenia). The guanidinium salt\nand all the chemicals used in the lysis buffer were obtained from\nSigma\u2013Aldrich (St Louis, MO,  USA). All the materials used in the\nexperiments were RNase-free. The DNA molecular weight marker,\nHyper Ladder I, was obtained from Bioline (London, UK) and Green-\nSafe Premium was purchased to NZYTech (Lisbon, Portugal).\n\n2.2.  Pre-miR-29 production and isolation\n\nThe pre-miR-29 was  obtained from the culture of Rhodovu-\nlum sulfidophilum DSM 1374 strain (BCCM/LMG, Belgium) modified\nwith the plasmid pBHSR1-RM containing the sequence of pre-\nmiR-29 [31]. Growth was  carried out in shaker flasks with\ncapacity of 500 mL  containing 100 mL  of Nutrient Broth medium\n(1 g/L beef extract; 2 g/L yeast extract; 5 g/L peptone and 5 g/L\nsodium chloride) supplemented with 30 ?g/mL kanamycin, in\na rotary shaker at 30 ?C and 250 rpm under dark-aerobic con-\nditions. The small RNA fraction was extracted from bacterial\npellets of Rhodovulum sulfidophilum by a modified acid guani-\ndinium thiocyanate\u2013phenol\u2013chloroform extraction method, as\ndescribed by Pereira and co-workers [21]. Briefly, cells were lysed\nand the small RNA fraction obtained was precipitated with iso-\npropanol. Precipitated molecules were recovered by centrifugation\nat 15,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min  at 4 ?C. After centrifuging, the small RNA\npellet was  washed with 75% ethanol and incubated at room temper-\nature for 10 min, followed by a 5 min  centrifugation at 15,000 \u00d7 g\n(4 ?C). The air-dried small RNA pellet was  solubilized in 1 mL of\nDEPC-treated water. Finally, 260 and 280 nm absorbance of the\nsamples was  measured using a nanophotometer in order to assess\nsmall RNA quantity and purity.\n\n2.3. Chromatographic experiments\n\nThe chromatographic experiments were performed in an \u00c4KTA\nAvant system with UNICORN 6 software (GE Healthcare, Sweden).\nFor the experiments, agmatine monolithic disk was equilibrated\nwith appropriate loading buffer, as described below, at a flow rate\nof 1 mL/min. The pre-miR-29 was  purified by exploiting three dif-\nferent elution strategies, namely by using sodium chloride (NaCl),\nammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) and arginine as competition agent.\nIn experiments with ammonium sulfate, the monolith was equili-\nbrated with 2.4 M of (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8).\nAfter the elution of unbound species, the ionic strength of the buffer\nwas stepwise decreased to reach the 0 M (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM\nTris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8), to elute of pre-miR-29. On the other hand, in\nexperiments with sodium chloride, after washing out the unbound\nmaterial with 1.75 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 9.5), the\nionic strength of the buffer was increased to 3 M NaCl in 10 mM\nTris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 9.5). The experiments performed with argi-\nnine as a competition agent to purify pre-miR-29 molecules were\ninitiated with the equilibration of the monolith with 1.75 M NaCl\nin 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 9.5) to promote the total retention\nof pre-miR-29 and then the elution was  accomplished by chang-\ning to 1.75 M NaCl supplemented with 100 mM arginine in 10 mM\nTris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 9.5). The most retained species were finally\neluted with 3 M NaCl. In the three sets of experiments, sRNAs\nextracts (30 ?g), containing 6S RNA, pre-miR-29 and other sRNA,\n\n178\n\n\n\nP. Pereira et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1368 (2014) 173\u2013182 175\n\nincluding transfer RNAs, were injected onto the column using a\n100 ?L loop at the same flow-rate. The absorbance of the elu-\nate was continuously monitored at 260 nm.  All experiments were\nperformed at room temperature. Fractions were pooled accord-\ning to the chromatograms obtained, and following concentration\nand desalting with Vivaspin concentrators (Vivascience), the pools\nwere kept for quantification and further analysis. A posterior study\nwas performed to analyze the effect of different flow-rates (0.5, 1,\n2 and 3 mL/min) in the pre-miR-29 purification efficiency using the\nagmatine monolith.\n\n2.4.  Dynamic binding capacity measurement for sRNA\n\nAgmatine monolithic disk was used for the determination of\nthe dynamic binding capacity (DBC) for RNA. These experiments\nwere performed with 1 mL/min of flow rate using different con-\ncentrations of the feedstock (0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.15, 0.20 and\n0.25 mg/mL). The support was equilibrated with 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl\nbuffer (pH 8) and thereafter, it was overloaded with the RNA solu-\ntion under the same equilibrium conditions. DBC was  determined\nby the breakthrough area integration method [32]. Briefly, each\nbreakthrough experiment was derived from a 100% of saturated\nmonolith. Then, the sample volume corresponding to the adsorbed\namount of RNA was calculated by numerical integration of the\ndetector response. The area obtained from the filled monolith was\nsubtracted from that for the empty monolith. In this step, the void\nvolume was discounted from the DBC determination. This area is\nequivalent to the sample volume, which was required to saturate\nthe monolithic support, and can be related with RNA mass that\nremained bound per milliliter of the support, reflecting the sup-\nport capacity. Normally, the capacity values are represented at 10,\n50 and 100% of the breakthrough that corresponds to 10, 50 and\n100% of the column saturation, being calculated in the same way.\nFinally, the elution of the bound RNA was achieved by increasing\nthe sodium chloride concentration in the mobile phase to 3 M in a\nstepwise manner.\n\n2.5.  Polyacrylamide electrophoresis\n\nFractions  recovered from the sRNA chromatographic exper-\niments were analyzed by vertical electrophoresis using an\nAmersham Biosciences system (GE Healthcare, Sweden) with 10%\npolyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 125 V for\n90 min  with TBE buffer (0.84 M Tris base, 0.89 M boric acid and\n0.01 M EDTA, pH 8.3). sRNA samples were previously denatured\nwith 97.5% formamide and denatured conditions were kept in the\ngel owing to the presence of 8 M urea. sRNA molecules were visu-\nalized in the gel by using the Vilber Lourmat system after staining\nwith ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/mL).\n\n2.6. Protein analysis\n\nProteins  contamination in pre-miR-29 samples collected from\nthe purification with agmatine monolithic support, was measured\nby using the micro-BCA (bicinchoninic acid) assay (Thermo Fisher\nScientific Inc., Rockford, IL, USA), according to manufacturer\u2019s\ninstructions. Briefly, the calibration curve was prepared using BSA\nstandards (0.01\u20130.25 mg/mL). A total of 25 ?L of each standard\nor pre-miR-29 samples was added to 200 ?L of BCA reagent in\na microplate and incubated for 30 min  at 60 ?C. Absorbance was\nmeasured at 570 nm in a microplate reader.\n\n2.7.  Pre-miR-29 identification analysis\n\nPre-miR-29 identification was confirmed using reverse-\ntranscriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Thus, cDNA\n\nsynthesis  was  performed using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Syn-\nthesis Kit (Fermentas, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.), according to\nthe manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A total of 0.5 ?g of RNA sam-\nples collected after the chromatographic purification process with\nagmatine monolith was used to initiate cDNA synthesis, which\nwas denatured for 5 min  at 65 ?C with 20 pmol of gene-specific\nprimers (5?-GACAGC GGT ATG ATC CCC CAA-3?). Then, PCR reac-\ntions were carried out using 1 ?L of synthesized cDNA in a 25 ?L\nreaction containing 0.125 U of Supreme DNA polymerase (NZYtech,\nLisbon, Portugal), 50 mM of magnesium chloride (NZYtech, Lisbon,\nPortugal) and 150 nM of each primer. Sense (5?-GGA AGCTGG TTT\nCAT ATG GTG-3?) and antisense (5?-CCC CCA AGA ACA CTG ATT\nTC-3?) primers were used to amplify a fragment of 145 bp. The\nPCR program was  carried out as follows: denaturation at 95 ?C for\n5 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 ?C for 30 s, 63 ?C for 30 s and 72 ?C\nfor 15 s, and a final elongation step at 72 ?C for 5 min. To confirm\nthe presence and purity of amplicons, PCR products were analyzed\nusing 1% agarose gel [21].\n\n3.  Results and discussion\n\nThe  purification methods developed to purify microRNAs\nenvisioning therapeutic applications require the use of a chro-\nmatographic support able to eliminate impurities, maintaining\nthe structural integrity of the biomolecule. Hence, the present\nstudy aims to explore and characterize the interactions occur-\nring between pre-miR-29 and agmatine amino acid derivative\nimmobilized into a monolithic disk, combining, for the first time,\nthe selectivity, specificity and biorecognition of agmatine ligands\nwith the structural versatility and capacity provided by mono-\nlithic supports. These supports offer several potential advantages\nover conventional supports, including higher selectivity and repro-\nducibility and good capacity [17,26,33,34]. The miR-29 target was\nchosen because it belongs to one of the most interesting miRNA\nfamilies in humans to date, once this miRNA is involved in several\nregulatory pathways associated with neurodegenerative diseases\nand also presenting tumor-suppressing and immune-modulating\nproperties [35\u201337]. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to\ndescribe an alternative method to purify pre-miRNA from a com-\nplex mixture of total RNA by affinity chromatography, exploiting\nthe multiple biological interactions which occur between the pre-\nmiR-29 and the agmatine ligand immobilized in monoliths.\n\n3.1.  Agmatine monolithic disk\n\nNon-grafted CDI monolith was properly modified with agmatine\nligand by BIA Separation (Ajdovs?c?ina,  Slovenia), and the suitable\nagmatine ligand immobilization was  confirmed through a compar-\nison of the different chromatographic profiles of the new support\nand the non-grafted CDI monolith (data not shown). Recently, our\nresearch group has demonstrated the possibility of using the non-\ngrafted CDI monolith to purify plasmid DNA by using a decreasing\nstepwise gradient of ammonium sulfate but not using sodium\nchloride (NaCl) [25,26]. Thereby, the two  monolithic disks were\nequilibrated with 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8) at 1 mL/min, and\nafter the injection of 30 ?g of sRNA sample, a 15-min linear gradient\nup to 3 M of NaCl in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8) was established.\nIn the non-grafted CDI monolith, a single peak was  rapidly attained\nin the flow through due to the elution of species with lower affin-\nity. Afterwards, the NaCl linear gradient was  established but no\nspecies were eluted (data not shown). These results indicated that\nthe non-grafted CDI monolith did not interact with sRNA molecules\nunder the conditions used. The same experiment was conducted in\nthe monolith modified with agmatine ligand. The total retention of\nsRNA was obtained at 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8) and the total\n\n179\n\n\n\n176 P.

Effect of feed concentration on dynamic binding capacity of\nsRNA\n\nFor a complete characterization of the agmatine monolithic\ndisk, the dynamic binding capacity (DBC) was evaluated, once\nthis parameter is a critical factor for the chromatographic per-\nformance. For this purpose, several breakthrough experiments\nwere performed at 1 mL/min, with different sRNA concentrations\n(0.025\u20130.25 mg/mL). The results summarized in Table 1 indicate\nthat the total capacity of the agmatine monolithic disk to bind\nsRNA was higher for the feed concentration of 0.25 mg/mL, where\nit was found a total capacity of 8.08 mg/mL. By analyzing the data\nin Table 1, it appears that at 10, 50 and 100% of the breakthrough,\nthe DBC increases with increasing RNA concentrations, thus, it can\nbe argued that the binding capacity is dependent of the RNA con-\ncentration. The profile obtained with agmatine monolithic disk is in\nconcordance with other RNA binding profiles described for mono-\nliths, such as CIM IDA monolithic column [38]. Furthermore, these\nDBC results found for agmatine monolith are very good when com-\npared with other values described for purified baker\u2019s yeast RNA,\nwhere the CIM IDA monolithic column presented a binding capac-\nity of 1.20 mg/mL, using 1 mg/mL  of feed RNA [38]. This comparison\nsuggests that the immobilized agmatine ligand can be responsible\nfor the improvement on the DBC of the monolithic support through\nthe enhancement of the interaction ligand\u2013sRNAs, although the\nsRNA concentrations used are significantly lower than in the pre-\nvious study (0.5\u20132 mg/mL) [38]. These findings can be due to the\nfact that RNA has a size of 100 nm to over 300 nm in diameter, and\nmonoliths present a larger channel size of 1000\u20135000 nm allow-\ning full availability of the ligands on the chromatographic support\neven at low feed concentration of sRNA. Thus, these results indi-\ncate that the DBC is dependent of sRNA feed concentration [39].\nOverall, these results suggest that a very efficient chromatographic\nperformance for RNA purification using monolithic columns can be\nachieved if using low RNA feed concentration.\n\nThrough the analysis of the isotherm profile, it can be seen\nthat, in the sRNA concentration range studied, the DBC increases\nfrom 3 mg/mL  to a plateau region, as the RNA concentration\n(CRNA) increases. Considering the equilibrium binding isotherm\ndata, Fig. 1, it is possible to define a linear and a plateau region. Thus,\nit is suggested that our data follow the Langmuir model, assuming\nthat the adsorbed molecules have a fixed number of sites on the\nadsorbent where interactions can occur, and that every adsorp-\ntion site is energetically equivalent and accepts only one molecule\n\nFig. 1. Adsorption isotherm of sRNA on agmatine monolith.\n\n[40]. At low concentrations (0.025\u20130.075 mg/mL), RNA is well dis-\ntributed at the agmatine ligands and the orientation is determined\nby agmatine ligand\u2013RNA interactions, resulting in a linear shaped\ncurve between RNA adsorbed amounts and mobile phase concen-\ntrations. At high concentrations (0.1\u20130.25 mg/mL), the adsorption\nsites may  become saturated, leading to a curvature of the isotherm\ninto an asymptote. Concentration values of sRNA absorbed above\n7 mg/mL  are considered in the overloaded zone of the isotherm.\n\nIn addition, the dissociation constant (Kd) from adsorption\nisotherm, which represents the interaction between the sRNA\nand agmatine monolithic support was also calculated by frontal\nanalysis chromatography, according to what is described by\nRuta and co-workers [41]. Through the values at 50% of break-\nthrough experiments obtained with agmatine monolith at different\nsRNA concentrations, the Kd value was 2.6 \u00d7 10?7 M.  A Kd value\nbetween 10?4 and 10?8 M indicates that the risks of irreversible\nbiomolecules adsorption and denaturation are minimized [40]. So,\nthe Kd value obtained, reveals a good affinity interaction between\nthe ligand and RNA, which indicates that agmatine monolith is a\ngood affinity support.\n\n3.3.  Effect of elution buffer composition and pH manipulation on\npre-miR-29  binding\n\nIn  affinity chromatography the elution of a target biomolecule\ncan be performed either specifically, through addition of a compet-\ning agent in the elution buffer or non-specifically, through changes\nin the elution buffer composition, namely in type of salt and ionic\nstrength, and pH manipulation depending on the matrix used and\nthe chemical characteristics of target biomolecule [18]. As previ-\nously mentioned, in this study the chromatographic behavior of the\nagmatine monolith interacting with RNA, was  evaluated according\nto the type and salt concentration and pH manipulation. Before-\nhand, several binding/elution studies were performed in order to\ndetermine the best salt concentration range to achieve the binding\nand elution of the pre-miR-29 (data not shown). Linear and step-\nwise gradients were tested, and it was  determined that the stepwise\nelution is more suitable to obtain the pre-miR-29 separation, once\nthis strategy allows greater selectivity between the biomolecule\nin study and contaminants. Moreover, it was  verified the possibil-\nity to establish an increased NaCl gradient to bind and recover the\npre-miR-29. After this preliminary characterization of the pre-miR-\n29 retention behavior on the agmatine monolith it was evaluated\nthe pH effect on pre-miR-29 stability, in order to determine which\npH value should be used in the purification process. In addition,\nthe pH could also significantly influence pre-miR-29 interactions\nwith the immobilized agmatine, given the versatility of this ligand.\nThus, several chromatographic experiments, based on ionic-based\n\n180\n\n\n\nP. Pereira et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1368 (2014) 173\u2013182 177\n\nTable  2\nEffect  of pH of mobile phase in the tRNA and pre-miR-29 retention, using 10 mM\nTris buffer as loading condition.\n\npH of mobile phase tRNA retention pre-miR-29 retention\n\n6.5 ++ ++\n8.0 + ++\n9.5 ? ++\n\nFrom (?) no retention to (++) total retention.\n\nelution conditions, were designed to analyze how the pH ranging\nbetween 6.5 and 9.5 affects the retention of pre-miR-29 and other R.\nsulfidophilum sRNA species, considering the pKa of 13 of this ligand\n[42].\n\nTable 2 summarizes several chromatographic runs performed\nat different loading conditions (pH and NaCl manipulation), and\nthe relative effect of these conditions on tRNA and pre-miR-29\nretention ((?) no retention to (++) total retention). As a matter\nof fact, the results showed an increased retention of all sRNAs\nspecies when the pH of the mobile phase is lower (pH 6.5), sug-\ngesting that the decreased pH favors the establishment of stronger\nelectrostatic interactions but also the involvement of multiple\nnon-covalent interactions, namely cation\u2013? interactions, hydrogen\nbonds, hydrogen ? interactions and water mediated bonds. These\ndifferent types of interaction established between the pre-miR-29\nand agmatine ligands can be related with the positive charge (the\neffective surface charge) of agmatine, considering the fact that at\nthe working pH (between 6.5.and 9.5), agmatine is protonated. In\naddition, the agmatine is a derivative of arginine amino acid, con-\ntaining basic guanidinium group and the lack of the carboxyl group,\nso that both amino acids have very similar structures. Thus, the\nmultiplicity of interactions can also occur because agmatine has\none polar center with which RNA can strongly associate. It is rea-\nsonable to suppose that the retention of all functional classes of\nRNA in agmatine monolith is due to the length of agmatine side\nchain and its ability to produce good hydrogen bond geometries\n[43,44], which can promote multicontact with RNA backbone or\nRNA bases, according to RNA folding (RNA conformations) [45\u201347].\nThe cation\u2013? interactions can be due to interactions between pos-\nitive guanidinium group of agmatine and aromatic rings of the\nnitrogen bases of RNA [17].\n\nMoreover, for the highest pH studied (pH 9.5), it was observed\nthat the pre-miR-29 was more retained than other species from\ntRNA, because some interactions described above are less favored\n\nand  therefore only some RNA species bound to the support, as pre-\nmiR-29, whereas other species do not bind. Thus, the pH used for\nthe study, using sodium chloride as elution strategy, was pH 9.5,\ndue to a higher retention of pre-miR-29 and a more pronounced\ndifference between the pre-miR-29 retention and the binding of\nother RNA species, which allowed exploring the selectivity of the\nagmatine ligand.\n\nTo  investigate the retention behavior of the target miRNA in\nthe agmatine monolith, after binding, the pre-miR-29 elution was\nachieved with the application of a stepwise gradient increasing\nthe NaCl concentration up to 3 M in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH\n9.5). The chromatographic profile of the pre-miR-29 purification\nfrom a complex mixture of R. sulfidophilum sRNA, using the agma-\ntine monolithic disk, is presented in Fig. 2A. The chromatographic\nrun was initiated with an ionic strength of 1.75 M NaCl in 10 mM\nTris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 9.5). After injection of the complex mixture of\nsRNA, a first peak was obtained with the same salt concentration\nof the equilibrium buffer, resulting from the elution of unbound\nspecies. As shown in Fig. 2A, the ionic strength of elution buffer\nwas increased to 2.5 M of NaCl to elute the pre-miR-29 in a second\npeak. The elution of highly bound species, mostly tRNAs, was then\nachieved by increasing the ionic strength of the buffer to 3 M NaCl\n(peak 3). In this way, this result demonstrates that the agmatine lig-\nands distinguished and differentially interacted with various RNA\nmolecules, suggesting a specific recognition for the pre-miR-29.\nThereby, in order to establish a correlation between the differ-\nent RNAs species present in the mixture, and the peaks in the\nchromatogram, a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2B) was\nperformed, thus the lines 1, 2 and 3 presented in the electrophoretic\nprofile correspond to the samples pooled from the respective peaks\nin the chromatogram. Hence, electrophoretic analysis revealed that\nthe first peak of unbound species corresponds to the elution of tRNA\nspecies (Fig. 2B, lane 1), at lower ionic strength. On the other hand,\nthe elution of the pre-miR-29 only occurs with the increase of ionic\nstrength in the second peak (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Finally, the 6S RNA,\npre-miR-29 and other tRNAs species were eluted with 3 M NaCl,\nas it was  observed in the third chromatographic peak (peak 3 and\nlane 3). These findings suggest that pre-miR-29 presents a stronger\ninteraction with the agmatine monolith than the majority of tRNA\nspecies.\n\nRecently, our research group demonstrated the possibility to\npurify pre-miR-29 using stepwise gradients of NaCl with the\narginine\u2013agarose matrix [21] being verified the pre-miR-29 elu-\ntion at 360 mM of NaCl, while in this study the agmatine monolith\n\nFig. 2.

Lane S, impure sRNA sample injected onto the\ncolumn.\n\nallowed the recovery and purification of pre-miR-29 with 2.5 M of\nNaCl. In general, this comparative study evidences that the bind-\ning mechanism inherent to the biorecognition of pre-miR-29 by\nthe agmatine amino acid derivative is stronger than the interac-\ntions established with the arginine amino acid. This phenomenon\ncan result from the combination of multiple elementary interac-\ntions such as electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonds, hydrogen\n? interactions, water mediated bonds and cation\u2013? interactions,\nwhich both ligands may  engage through the terminal guanidine\ngroup. However, in the agmatine monolith a stronger interaction\noccurred since the recovery of pre-miR-29 required a higher NaCl\nconcentration. The difference between the ligands is the absence of\nthe carboxyl group in agmatine, which can have two positive effects\nin the RNA retention. It can prevent repulsion of charged molecules\nand enables the establishment of additional hydrophobic inter-\nactions with the carbon backbone of the ligand. Thus, depending\non the environmental conditions established and the amino acid\nligands used, some interactions can be more favored than other,\nbecoming more evident under these conditions. In order to prove\nthis hypothesis and mainly exploit hydrophobic interactions, a\nstepwise gradient by decreasing ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4)\nconcentration between 2.4 M and 0 M in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer\n(pH 8) was applied. In this case, the agmatine monolith was  equili-\nbrated with 2.4 M (NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8). After\nthe binding of the sample to the disk, a first elution step designed\nto elute the tRNA species with lower affinity to the support was\ncarried out with the same salt concentration of the equilibrium\nbuffer, promoting total pre-miR-29 retention (Fig. 3A). The elution\nof pre-miR-29 was then achieved with a second step by using 0 M\n(NH4)2SO4 in 10 mM  Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 8) (Fig. 3A). In fact, the\nhigh salt concentration plays a key role on the pre-miR-29 bind-\ning to agmatine ligand. Again, a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\nwas used to detect and identify different species eluting in each\nchromatographic peak (Fig. 3B). The electrophoretic analysis of\nthe fractions eluting from the agmatine monolith (Fig. 3A) proved\nthat the first peak of unbound material corresponds to the elu-\ntion of tRNA (Fig. 3B, lane 1), whereas the second peak was mainly\nattributed to the elution of pre-miR-29 (Fig. 3B, lane 2). The interac-\ntions that favor the recognition of pre-miR-29, under hydrophobic\nelution conditions, can be van der Waals forces and hydrophobic\ninteractions while the main responsible group for the interactions\nestablished between pre-miR-29 and agmatine ligand can be the\ncarbon chain of the spacer arm.\n\nThe functionality of agmatine ligand to biorecognize the pre-\nmiR-29 under hydrophobic- and ionic-based elution conditions\n\nshows  the applicability and versatility of this ligand to develop\nseveral pre-miR-29 purification strategies due to the multiple\ninteractions involved for each condition. Apart from the struc-\ntural characteristics of the agmatine ligand, also the pre-miR-29\nstructural features seem to be relevant on its distinct interaction\nbehavior with the ligand. The main explanation for the specific\ninteractions occurring between the pre-miR-29 and the agmatine\namino acid derivative is the single-stranded nature of RNA, which\nis normally involved in RNA recognition, due to the high base expo-\nsure and availability for interactions. Additionally, the negative\ncharge conferred by the phosphate groups in the RNA backbone is\nimportant for their interaction with the agmatine monolith, sug-\ngesting them to have a crucial role in RNA retention. Likewise,\npre-miR-29 is a sRNA molecule with the shape of a stem-loop\nor hairpin consisting of two long irregular double-stranded stem\nregions, which are interrupted by a largely single-stranded internal\nloop [21]. This particular structure may also explain the multiple\nnon-covalent interactions established which are involved in the\nbiomolecular recognition of pre-miR-29 by the agmatine ligand.\n\nIn  turn, to obtain an elution strategy more selective and biospe-\ncific as well as to achieve higher elution efficiency, it was employed\na new approach for pre-miR-29 purification using arginine as com-\npetitive agent. This agent can bind either to the retained pre-miR-29\nor to the immobilized agmatine ligand depending on their char-\nacteristics, allowing thus to predict the interactions that can be\ninvolved once agmatine is derived of arginine. The competitive\nstudies were performed by adding 250 mM of arginine to the\nelution buffer in stepwise gradient to exploit specific elution of\npre-miR-29 from the agmatine monolith and therefore to evalu-\nate the possibility of reaching higher purification factors. Elution\ngradients applied were adapted to ensure that the RNA sample is\non ideal conditions to bind to the support and be eluted only due\nto the competing agent. Agmatine monolith was  first equilibrated\nwith 1.75 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 9.5) to promote the\ntotal retention of pre-miR-29. After sample application, a first peak\nof unbound species was  obtained and then the ionic strength was\nincreased upon arginine addition. In this step, 1.75 M of NaCl sup-\nplemented with 100 mM arginine in 10 mM Tris\u2013HCl buffer (pH 9.5)\nwas used for the elution of pre-miR-29 in a second peak (Fig. 4A).\n\nThese  findings are in accordance with previous published results\nwhich show that this competition strategy is able to elute bound\npre-miR-29 from arginine\u2013agarose column [21]. It is suggested\nthat the major mechanism from which pre-miR-29 is eluted from\nthe agmatine support is the preferential binding of free arginine\nto the pre-miR-29, an interaction that we believe to be stronger\n\n182\n\n\n\nP.

In fact, since\nthe arginine is positively charged at the pH in study, electrostatic\ninteractions can possible occur between the pre-miR-29 and the\nfree arginine. However, another mechanism that can explain pre-\nmiR-29 elution is the interaction of free arginine with the agmatine\nligand in the immobilized support [48], that could also promote the\ndisplacement of bound pre-miR-29. The last peak corresponded to\nthe elution of tRNAs and some residual pre-miR-29 by increasing\nthe ionic strength to 3 M of NaCl. The results of polyacrylamide gel\nelectrophoresis (Fig. 4B) showed that the tRNAs were recovered in\nthe first peak (lane 1), being separated from the pre-miR-29 that\nwas attained in the second peak (lane 2), while other tRNAs and\npre-miR-29 were obtained in the third peak (lane 3). As judged by\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pre-miR-29 was isolated and\nsuitably purified in the second chromatographic step with high\nintegrity. However, even if some arginine remains in the sample,\nthe structure of pre-miR-29 is not changed, as we have previ-\nously studied by circular dichroism (data not shown). Actually, the\napplication of arginine can also be strongly associated with the pre-\nserved integrity observed in RNA samples since arginine, owing to\nits multiplicity for interactions, has been largely associated with\nstabilizing effects on RNA conformation [17,21].\n\nIn a general way, the competition study has shown that the free\narginine could promote the pre-miR-29 biospecific elution of the\nagmatine monolith.\n\nBeyond  the potential application of agmatine-based affinity\nchromatography to purify pre-miR-29 described here, this study\nalso demonstrates the possibility of using three different strate-\ngies to achieve the pre-miRNA purification. In fact, the purification\nof pre-miR-29 was accomplished either using an increased NaCl\nor decreased (NH4)2SO4 gradients or using a competition strategy\nwith arginine supplemented buffer. In addition, this work proves\nthe relevance of the establishment of well-defined binding and\nelution conditions to enhance the pre-miR-29 purification perfor-\nmance, resulting in an improvement of the final pre-miRNA yields,\nas this could represent an important impact on therapeutic applica-\ntions of the purified pre-miR-29. Comparing the elution strategies\nwith NaCl or arginine to elute bound pre-miR-29 biomolecules, it\nwas found that the competition strategy favors the selectivity for\npre-miR-29 because the arginine concentration needed to promote\nelution is lower than the NaCl concentrations. This fact is in accor-\ndance with what has been previously described by other authors,\nbecause as arginine is monovalent at the pH used, it is equivalent to\nNaCl in terms of valency; however the conductivity is much lower\n\nthan  for NaCl at identical concentrations [21,49]. This study also\nallowed the purification of pre-miR-29 in 20 min at a flow-rate of\n1 mL/min.\n\n3.4.  Effect of flow rate on pre-miR-29 purification\n\nThe effect of flow rate on purification of pre-miR-29 was investi-\ngated, although no change is expected on the separation selectivity\nonce some studies proved that the molecules separation is flow-\nindependent due to the physical and chemical constitution of\nmonoliths [26,50]. Therefore, to verify the impact of flow rate on\npurification of pre-miR-29, the same elution gradient previously\nestablished for the ideal separation was used. Fig. 5A shows the\nresulting chromatograms for the separation of pre-miR-29 at the\ndifferent flow rates from 0.5 to 3 mL/min. The purity of pre-miR-29\nseparated with different flow rates was  followed by electrophore-\nsis as shown in Fig. 5B. Evaluating the chromatograms and the\nrespective electrophoresis, it is clearly evident that no changes have\noccurred in the separation efficiency of pre-miR-29 for the different\nflow rates under study, but a significant reduction on the chromato-\ngraphic run time was verified when higher flow rates were used\n(Fig. 5A). It is also possible to observe that the chromatograms over-\nlap each other even at the highest applied flow rate of 3 mL/min. In\nthis case the separation was completed in 9 min, which is in accor-\ndance with the advantages presented by the monolithic supports,\nwhere the chromatographic run was  4 times faster that the time\nused in conventional matrix of arginine [21].\n\n3.5. Pre-miR-29 characterization\n\nTo  ensure the success of the pre-miR-29 purification method-\nologies here described for therapeutic applications it is essential\nto guarantee the total elimination of impurities such as proteins,\nassessed by the micro-BCA method and endotoxins evaluated\nby LAL assay as well as to isolate the pre-miR-29 from other\nsRNAs species, which may  be assured by polyacrylamide gel elec-\ntrophoresis [5,51]. Moreover, RNA preparations should maintain\nthe structural integrity, free from enzymatic inhibitors for RT and\nPCR reactions and free from nucleases [52].\n\nThe concentration and quality of the pre-miR-29 preparations\nisolated by the agmatine monolith were evaluated by Phoretix\n1D software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, United Kingdom)\nthrough the evaluation of the intensity of electrophoretic bands.\nThe quantitative analysis of pre-miR-29 throughout the isolation\n\n183\n\n\n\n180 P. Pereira et al. / J. Chromatogr. A 1368 (2014) 173\u2013182\n\nFig. 5. (A) Effect of flow rate on resolution of pre-miR-29. Experiments were performed in the same salt and gradient conditions applied for the pre-miR-29 purification\n(presented in Fig. 2) at different flow rates (0.5, 1, 2 and 3 mL/min). (B) The peaks obtained in the chromatographic runs at different flow rates were identified by polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis.\n\nprocedure is summarized in Table 3, which presents the purity\ndegree, purification factor and recovery yield of pre-miR-29 sample\nobtained with the agmatine monolith. In a general point of view,\nthe strategy with NaCl enabled a high recovery (97.33%) of the tar-\nget miRNA but the purity degree only reached 75.21%, whereas the\nstrategy with (NH4)2SO4 allows the recovery of the partially purify\npre-miR-29 (35.51% of purity) when the salt concentration is signif-\nicantly reduced. On the other hand, the competition studies using\narginine in the elution buffer, demonstrated the possibility of puri-\nfying pre-miR-29 with higher purity (90.11% of purity and 94.88%\nof yield) in comparison to the other strategies, even though some\npre-miRNA is lost in the final elution step. Thus, if larger amounts\nof pure pre-miRNA are desired, the strategy that employs NaCl can\nbe used, while if higher purity levels are necessary, the competition\nstrategy with arginine is more appropriate [21].\n\nThe protein quantification in the purified pre-miR-29 fractions\ncollected from the chromatographic peaks was performed using\nthe micro-BCA assay (Table 3). The analysis of the protein con-\ntent in the fractions collected along the pre-miR-29 purification\ngradient revealed that proteins tend to elute more in the first\ngradient step (data not shown). Therefore, the chromatographic\nstrategies used in these new pre-miRNA isolation methods (peak\n2 in Figs. 2A, 3A and 4A) also provide a reduction of protein con-\ntamination in RNA samples, specifically in the competition strategy\nusing arginine in the elution buffer, where the protein contami-\nnation level was negligible (2.774 \u00b1 0.005 ng/?L), as required for\ntherapeutic applications (Table 3). Endotoxins contamination was\nassessed using the ToxinSensorTM Chromogenic Limulus Amoe-\nbocyte Lysate (LAL) Endotoxin Assay Kit (GenScript, USA, Inc.)\naccording to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The endotoxins con-\ntent in the final pre-miR-29 sample indicates a significant reduction\nof the endotoxins level throughout the chromatographic step with\nthe agmatine monolith, with a purification factor of pre-miR-29\n\nFig. 6. pre-miR-29 identification by reverse-transcription PCR.

Conclusions\n\nThis work combines, for the first time, the structural versatility\nprovided by monolithic supports with the specificity and selectivity\nof agmatine ligand, as a promising strategy for miRNA purification.\nMoreover, the characterization of the modified monolith revealed\nthat a maximum binding capacity at 100% breakthrough was\n8.08 mg/mL  for a RNA concentration of 0.25 mg/mL. The obtained\nKd value, 2.6 \u00d7 10?7 M,  confirms that the agmatine monolith sup-\nport develops a good affinity interaction with RNA, showing that\nagmatine monolith is a good affinity chromatographic support.\nThe implementation of agmatine monolithic chromatography for\npre-miR-29 purification was based on the development of spe-\ncific interactions between the pre-miR-29 and agmatine ligands,\nallowing the removal of other RNA species, as well as the reduction\nof proteins and endotoxins contaminants, obtaining highly pure\npre-miR-29 for therapeutic applications. The type and salt con-\ncentration and pH manipulation in the loading buffer allows the\nestablishment of different interactions and consequently different\nelution strategies. The exploitation of these affinity interactions,\nresulting from multiple intermolecular forces, namely van der\nWaals forces, hydrogen bonds, electrostatic and hydrophobic inter-\nactions, can trigger new insights not only in isolation strategies but\nalso in many other RNA research fields owing to its implication in\nmolecular recognition phenomena. Additionally, for the pre-miR-\n29 purification this monolithic support represents an advantageous\nalternative to conventional supports due to fast separation and\nconsequent short contact time, ensuring structural stability of the\ntarget molecule. In conclusion, our approach revealed an efficient\ntechnique to obtain pharmaceutical-grade miRNA with high recov-\nery yield, purity and good integrity, which may  in a near future be\nused in RNA structural and functional studies as well as in gene\ntherapy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for\nScience and Technology (PTDC/EBB-BIO/114320/2009, EXPL/BBB-\nBIO/1056/2012, COMPETE: FCOMP-01-0124-FEDER-027560 and\nPest-C/SAU/UI0709/2011).

The effects of properties of the polycation, such as molecular weight, charge\ndensity and backbone structure, to polyplex structure and physicochemical behavior were systematically\nevaluated. The condensing agents, polyethylenimine (PEI), chitosan (CS) and poly(allylamine) (PAA) were\nadded to sRNA molecules at different N/P ratio. The efficiency of encapsulation and protection of sRNA, as\nwell as polyplex size, zeta potential and morphology were followed and compared. The results show that\nPEI/sRNA polyplexes display a small size and positive zeta potential. However, for low molecular weights,\nthis polycation is unable to protect sRNA in the presence of a decompacting agent. With chitosan, sRNA is\nefficiently compacted at high N/P ratios. The CS/sRNA complexes display small sizes, ca. 200 nm, positive\nsurface charge and also good stability. Finally, the PAA/sRNA polyplexes were found to be the smallest at\nlow N/P ratios, displaying a good encapsulation efficiency and high stability. A rationale for the experi-\nmental observations is provided using Monte Carlo simulation for systems with polycations of different\nlength and charge density. The simulations showed that there is an interplay between the size of poly-\ncation chains and its charge density that define the degree of condensation for sRNA.\n\n? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction\n\nGene therapy has gained significant attention over the past two\ndecades as a promising approach for a future therapeutic strategy\nin clinical applications. Gene therapy is important not only for the\ntreatment of diseases caused by genetic defects, but also in the\ndevelopment of methods for treatment and prevention of a wide\nrange of acquired disorders that include severe combined immu-\nnodeficiency, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease, as well as an alternative to the traditional chemotherapy\nused in treating cancer [1\u20134].\n\nOver recent years, the importance of RNA in numerous biologi-\ncal processes has increased substantially. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are\nbeing increasingly recognized as crucial regulatory molecules in\nall organisms. The specificity and the potency of sRNAs suggest\nthat they might become therapeutic agents, especially in interfer-\nence RNA strategies [5\u20137]. Free therapeutic genes can be enzymat-\nically degraded by ubiquitous nucleases resulting in a short\nhalf-life in the blood. For that reason they show poor cellular\nuptake when delivered in aqueous solutions, and insufficient tissue\n\nbioavailability, which has stimulated the development of carrier\nsystems for gene delivery [1,8,9]. The gene carriers include viral\nsystems such as retrovirus and adenovirus or non-viral systems,\nincluding cationic polymers, cationic lipids, peptides and dendri-\nmers [10,11]. The polycations are a promising alternative to com-\npact RNA for systemic delivery because of their low cytotoxicity,\nlow immunogenicity, high stability, biocompatibility, and unre-\nstricted gene materials size. In addition, potential safety benefits\nmake these compounds increasingly attractive for gene therapy\n[4,12\u201314]. Moreover, non-viral vectors present relatively low cost\nproduction and high flexibility, allowing to design carriers with\nwell-defined structural and chemical properties [1].\n\nCationic polymers can efficiently condense RNA molecules into\nnanometer range complexes, commonly via protonated amine\ngroups that promote the electrostatic interaction with the nega-\ntively charged phosphate groups in RNA [15]. They may also\nprovide a positively charged surface in the complex. One of the\nobstacles for an efficient gene transfection is crossing the negatively\ncharged cell membrane, and net positive charge of the polyplexes\npromotes electrostatic interaction with the overall negative charge\nof the cell membrane and prevents particle aggregation [14\u201316]. In\naddition, the size of the polyplexes should be between 50 and\n200 nm for efficient internalization by endocytic processes, and\nonce inside the cell, they should dissociate to release the sRNAs\nfrom the vector system for their respective functions [17\u201319].\n\n0021-9797/$ - see front matter ? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Polyethylenimine (PEI), a polycationic polymer has\nemerged as one of the most promising candidates for the develop-\nment of efficient gene delivery vectors [12]. The complexes PEI-\nnucleotide show high stability, controllable size, adjustable\nunpackaging properties in cells, and flexibility for addition of moi-\neties that target specific entities on cell membranes and intracellu-\nlar structures [20]. In particular, PEI has potential as a RNA carrier\ndue to its superior transfection efficiency which may facilitate\nendosomal escape after entering the cells as it acts as a \u2018\u2018proton\nsponge\u2019\u2019 during acidification of the endosome [13,21]. Chitosan\n(CS) is also considered to be a good candidate to integrate gene\ndelivery systems. CS presents beneficial qualities such as low tox-\nicity, low immunogenicity, excellent biodegradability, biocompati-\nbility, as well as a high positive charge that can easily form\npolyelectrolyte complexes with negatively charged nucleotides\nthrough electrostatic interactions [2,9,22]. Recently, poly(allyla-\nmine) (PAA), a synthetic cationic polymer having high density of\nprimary amino groups, has drawn considerable attention as a\nnon-viral gene delivery system [23]. PAA carries a strong positive\ncharge, which enables it to bind and package negatively charged\nsRNA. It is a polymer extensively used in the formulation of bio-\ncompatible films, nanomaterials and for cell encapsulation.\n\nIn the present work, a systematic study of different polymers,\nPEI, CS and PAA, with different molecular weights and charge den-\nsities is performed. The aim of this study is to compare the perfor-\nmance of these different polycations on sRNA condensation, with\nthe subsequent assessment of the biophysical and structural char-\nacteristics (such as size, zeta potential, morphology and complex\nstability) of the polymer\u2013sRNA complexes, in order to design a suc-\ncessful delivery system for sRNA.\n\n2. Experimental section\n\n2.1. Materials\n\nFive different polycations were used. CS low molecular weight\n(LMW) (Mw = 50\u2013190 kDa; degree of deacetylation in the 75\u201385%\nrange), CS medium molecular weight (MMW) (Mw = 190\u2013\n310 kDa, degree of deacetylation in the 75\u201385% range), PEI-LMW\nwith Mw = 1.3 kDa, 50 wt% in H2O and PAA of 17 kDa, 20 wt% in\nH2O were obtained from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). PEI\nhigh molecular weight (HMW) of Mw = 10 kDa was purchased from\nPolysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA). Guanidinium salt and all the\nchemicals used in the lysis buffer were obtained from Sigma (St.\nLouis, MO, USA). All solution were freshly prepared using 0.05%\ndiethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water. DEPC was purchased\nfrom Fluka (Sigma). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from\nBiochrom and heparin (25,000 IU for 5 mL) was obtained from\nWinthrop.\n\n2.2. sRNA samples\n\nsRNA samples used in this study were isolated from Escherichia\ncoli DH5a based on the protocol described by Martins and co-\nworkers (2010), in which an acid guanidinium thiocyanate\u2013phe-\nnol\u2013chloroform method is used [24]. Briefly, cells were lysed and\nthe nucleic acid fraction obtained was precipitated with isopropa-\nnol. The precipitate was recovered by centrifugation at 16,000g for\n20 min at 4 ?C. After centrifuging, the sRNA pellets were air-dried\nfor 5 min at room temperature and their solubilization was per-\nformed in 200 lL of 0.05% DEPC-treated water. Finally, the optical\ndensity of the samples was determined using a Nanophotometer to\nassess sRNA quantity and purity.\n\n2.3. Polyplex formation\n\nAll the polyplexes were formulated using the method of simple\ncomplexation between molar concentrations of positive charge,\npresent in the protonated amine groups of polycation (N), and\nthe negative charge of the phosphate groups of RNA (P) [3,8]. To\ndetermine specific N/P ratios, the mass of 325 Da corresponding\nto one phosphate group on sRNA was used. Moreover, over the\npH used in this study, sRNA displays an approximately constant\nanionic charge density, with the pKa of the respective phosphate\ngroup close to 1.5 [25]. The calculation of the positive charges\nwas made in accordance with the pKa values and molecular weight\nof each polycation (Table 1). sRNA stock solution was prepared by\nsRNA dissolution in sodium acetate buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate/\n0.1 M acetic acid, pH 4.5), up to a final concentration of 25 lg/\nmL. The sRNA concentration was determined by UV absorbance\nat 260 nm. A solution of 40 lg/mL of RNA will have an absorbance\nof 1 [26]. The polycation stock solutions were also prepared in so-\ndium acetate buffer pH 4.5 in a concentration of 10 mg/mL.\nPreliminary experiments were performed to identify the concen-\ntration range where the polyplexes are formed. A fixed volume of\npolycation solution (100 lL) of variable concentration was added\nto a sRNA solution (400 lL). The final concentration of sRNA was\nequal to 20 lg/mL (60.6 lM) and was kept constant in all the\nmethods used for the characterization of the formed complexes.\nParticles were obtained by addition of cationic polymer solution\nto sRNA solution and immediately vortexed at maximum speed\nfor 30 s. All the samples were subsequently left for equilibration\nat room temperature for 60 min.\n\n2.4. Circular dichroism (CD)\n\nCD was used to monitor the RNA behavior when subjected to\ndifferent pH values. CD spectra were obtained using a 0.2 cm path\nlength quartz rectangular cell at a constant temperature of 25 ?C, in\na Jasco 1850 spectrophotometer. Spectra were recorded from 215\nto 320 nm at a scan speed of 10 nm/min and a bandwidth of\n1 mm. Three spectra were accumulated and averaged for each\nsample. The final sRNA concentration was 100 lg/mL. All measure-\nments were conducted under a constant gas flow, to purge the\nozon generated by the light source of the instrument. The CD signal\nwas converted to molar ellipticity, smoothed with a Jasco Fast Fou-\nrier transform algorithm.\n\n2.5. Gel agarose sRNA assays\n\nA series of polycation/sRNA polyplexes in different ratios were\nprepared as described above. The samples (20 lL) were analyzed\nby horizontal electrophoresis using 0.8% of agarose gels (Hoefer,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA). The electrophoresis was carried out in\nTris\u2013acetic acid (TAE) buffer in DEPC-treated water (40 mM Tris\nbase, 20 mM acetic acid and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) and run at 90 V\nfor 50 min. The bands corresponding to sRNA and polycation/sRNA\ncomplexes were visualized under ultraviolet light after staining the\ngels with ethidium bromide (0.5 lg/mL) or 5 lL of a 10,000? solu-\ntion of Gelstar. The gels were imaged using a Vilber Lourmat sys-\ntem (ILC Lda, Lisbon, Portugal).\n\n2.6. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)\n\nThe morphological characteristics of the polyplexes were\nvisualized with a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi\nS-2700, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, one drop of the solution containing\nthe polyplex samples was placed on the surface of cover glasses\nand stored at 37 ?C overnight. Subsequently, the samples were\n\nP.

Particle size and zeta potential measurements\n\nThe mean particle diameter of the polyplexes and polydisper-\nsion index were determined by dynamic light scattering (photon\ncorrelation spectroscopy, PCS) using an N5 Particle Analyzer (Beck-\nman Coulter Inc., USA). Particle diameters of the freshly prepared\ncomplexes were measured at 25 ?C, and data were collected at\n90? scattering angle. The time-averaged autocorrelation functions\nwere transformed into intensity-weighted distributions of the\napparent hydrodynamic diameter using the available Malvern\nPCS software 6.20. The surface charges (zeta potential) of the poly-\nplexes were determined by laser Doppler electrophoresis using a\nZetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK), at 25 ?C. The\naverage values of size and zeta potential were calculated with\nthe data obtained from three measurements \u00b1 SD.\n\n2.8. Determination of sRNA encapsulation efficiency\n\nThe sRNA encapsulation efficiency (EE) was calculated from the\ndetermined free sRNA concentration in the supernatant recovered\nafter particle centrifugation (15,000g, 20 min, 25 ?C). The amount\nof unbound sRNA was determined by UV\u2013Vis analysis (Shimadzu\nUV\u2013Vis 1700 spectrophotometer) at 260 nm. Supernatant recov-\nered from unloaded polycation (without sRNA) was used as a\nblank. Three repetitions of this procedure were performed for each\nsystem. The encapsulation efficiency was calculated as\n\nEE \u00f0%\u00de\u00bc \u00bd\u00f0Total sRNA amount\n? sRNA supernatant amount\u00de=Total sRNA amount?\n? 100\n\n2.9. Polyplexes: release profile and protection of sRNA\n\nProtection and release profile of the sRNA present in the poly-\nplexes were also assessed. All the polyplexes were resuspended\nin PBS buffer, pH 7.4. The protection experiments were carried\nout by incubation of 12.5 lL of polyplexes with 1.5 lL of RNase\nsolution (10 and 100 lg/mL) for 1 h at 37 ?C or with 10% of fetal\nbovine serum (FBS) for 30 and 60 min at 37 ?C. To characterize\nthe release of the encapsulated sRNA, samples were incubated with\na series of heparin solutions (0.01, 0.1, 0.5 and 1 IU/mL of heparin),\nprepared by diluting aliquots of a heparin stock solution (10 IU/\nmL). The polyplex solutions (10 lL) were incubated with 10 lL of\neach concentration for 1 h at 37 ?C.\n\n2.10. Molecular modeling\n\nAn estimation of size and charge density of all polycations used\nwas carried out resorting to the Avogadro package [27], using the\n\nUFF force field [28]. The structure of all polycations was estab-\nlished considering at least ten monomers. The average distance be-\ntween charged groups, dAB, and also the average size per monomer\nwere established, considering the structure of each monomer as gi-\nven by the manufacturer.\n\n2.11. Monte Carlo simulation\n\nThe systems studied in this work were modeled in a coarse-\ngrain approach, where all ions and chain monomers are considered\nas charged hard-spheres and the solvent is considered as a contin-\nuum with a dielectric permittivity of water. We modeled a titration\nof a polyanion with 100 negative charged beads, with oppositely\ncharged polyplexes with variable chain lengths and charge densi-\nties. The four different systems are listed in Table 2. The notation\ncorresponding to the length of the polycation chain and corre-\nsponding charge density (e.g. Short-HCD) is used. The charge den-\nsity varies between low (LCD), moderate (MCD) and high (HCD).\nThe charge ratio, N/P, between polyanion and polycation were kept\nconstant, equal to unity, for all systems considered. It is given by\n\nN=P \u00bc\nzmon;PC Nmon;PC NPC\n\nzmon;PANmon;PA\n\nwhere Zmon is the charge of monomers, Nmon is the number of mono-\nmers in each chain and N is the number of polycation chains in the\nsystem. The subscript PC and PA correspond to polycation and pol-\nyanion, respectively. The linear charge density, dz, of the polycation\nchains was calculated as,\n\ndz \u00bc\nNmon;PC Zmon;PC\n\u00f0Nmon;PC ? 1\u00deR0\n\nand taking R0 as the bead-bead separation. A more extensive\ndescription of this method can be seen in previous work by some\nof the authors [29]. In the present work, the hard sphere radius of\npolyanion beads was 2.7 \u00c5 and of positive beads of polycation 2 \u00c5.\nA reference distance between connected monomers of 6.5 \u00c5 was\nimposed for the negative chain, 5.6 \u00c5 for the polycations. The\nharmonic force constant and angular force constant used was\n0.4 N m?1 and 1.7 ? 10?24 J deg?2, respectively. The polyelectrolyte\nbackbones correspond to semi-flexible polymers, in terms of\n\nTable 1\nMain characteristics of PEI-LMW, PEI-HMW, CS-LMW, CS-MMW and PAA.\n\nPolymer Molecular weight (MW)a Monomer charge density (e)a Nominal DDb (%) Determined DDc (%) pKa\nref\n\nPEI-LMW 1300 11+ \u2013 \u2013 9.26 [15]\nPEI-HMW 10,000 3+ \u2013 \u2013 8.5 [45]\nCS-LMW 50,000\u2013190,000 1+ 75\u201385 83.14 \u00b1 0.39 6.5 [15]\nCS-MMW 190,000\u2013310,000 1+ 75\u201385 73.86 \u00b1 0.61 6.5 [15]\nPAA 17,000 1+ \u2013 \u2013 8.5 [46]\n\na e is the elementar charge.\nb Provided by the manufacturer.\nc Determined by 1DUVS.

Considering also the electrostatic\neffects, the values of the persistence length, in the presence of the\nrespective counterions only, is 28 \u00c5 for the polyanion, and ca.\n22 \u00c5 for the polycations, irrespective of the chain length. For each\nsystem, Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations were performed in\nthe canonical ensemble using the Molsim package [30]. The effi-\nciency of the simulations was improved by taking concerted moves\nin the chain particles. These included translation as a whole and\nslithering [31]. The rate of acceptance of single particle moves for\nthe polyanion was 33% for a simulation of a compact polyplex (sys-\ntem Short-HCD), while translation and slithering warranted levels\nof acceptance of 4% and 39%, respectively. In general, all remaining\nsystems yielded higher values for the polyanion. The polycation\nmoves resulted in significantly higher rates of acceptance: 44%,\n32% and 38% for the single particle, translation as a whole and slith-\nering, respectively, also in system Short-HCD. Again, the remaining\nsystems displayed higher acceptance ratios for the polycations\nbackbone.\n\n3. Results and discussion\n\n3.1. Structural characteristics of the polycations\n\nFrom the structures of different polycations with optimized\nconformation, it is possible to determine the average size and\ncharge density of the respective monomers (Fig. 1). Also, consider-\ning the molecular weight of each monomer and the corresponding\naverage chain molecular weight, it is possible to estimate the num-\nber of monomers per chain, Nmon,PC. The linear charge density was\ncalculated similarly to what was described for the Monte Carlo\nsimulation but zmon,PC is the number of charges in each monomer\n(see Table 1) and R0 is the length per monomer. Table 3 summa-\nrizes the results obtained from simple molecular mechanics calcu-\nlations in gas phase. It should be stressed that these are rough\nestimates, in which the groups are not protonated to avoid the\nnecessity of a solvent, and aim at facilitate the link between the\nexperimental and theoretical approaches. Chitosan chains display\nthe highest chain length, but the lowest charge density. The\n\nhighest charge density is, as expected, obtained for PEI polymers.\nIn this case, and due to the fact that these polycations are\nbranched, it is more difficult to establish the total chain length.\nThis is especially important in the case of PEI, 10 kDa, in which\nthe branching is random. PAA presents an intermediate size and\nchain length. Further details will be discussed in the next sections.\n\n3.2. Assessment of sRNA stability in different solutions\n\nThe conformational stability of the sRNA secondary structure\nwas assessed at different solutions (H2O\u2013DEPC and acetate buffer,\npH 4.5) using CD (Fig. 2). The CD spectra of the sRNA in H2O\u2013DEPC\nis very similar and show characteristic features of the A-RNA [32].\nFor sRNA in H2O\u2013DEPC, a positive band around 260 nm was ob-\nserved, and a negative signal at 220 nm, with approximately the\nsame intensity. On the other hand, the sRNA spectrum in acetate\nbuffer at pH 4.5 depicts a decrease in the value of the molar ellip-\nticity of the positive band (260 nm) and maintains the negative sig-\nnal at 220 nm. These results show that isolated RNA is sensitive to\nthe buffer used, since the respective CD spectrum is different in\nacetate buffer and in water. This indicates that the sRNA structure\nis altered at lower pH.\n\nTo check on RNA integrity, further techniques were used.

The nucleic acid concen-\ntration was estimated using the absorbance values at 260 nm,\nwhile the integrity of each sample was determined by calculating\nthe 260/280 ratio. The spectrophotometric data show that RNA in\nH2O\u2013DEPC displays a high degree of integrity as extracted from\nthe absorbance ratio, A260/280 = 2.017 \u00b1 0.046, value which is\nin close agreement with the reference ratio 2.0 \u00b1 0.1 [26]. A\nsimilar value is obtained for RNA in acetate buffer,\nA260/280 = 1.979 \u00b1 0.057. Electrophoresis analysis is an important\ncomplementary technique that also enables to assess RNA integrity\n[26]. For that purpose, the UVIband\u20141D gel analysis software\n(Uvitec, Cambridge, UK) is used as an auxiliary of the agarose\nelectrophoresis allowing the determination of the intensity of\nsRNA bands. Fig. 2B shows the semiquantitative analysis of the\nintensity of sRNA bands in H2O\u2013DEPC and acetate buffer. The value\nof peak volume obtained was 40,505,059, which indicates that the\nintensity of sRNA in H2O\u2013DEPC band is slightly higher than the\nintensity of sRNA in acetate buffer (37,224,173). Together, these\nresults demonstrate that there is a small decrease of RNA integrity,\nbut it remains stable at pH 4.5 (Fig. 2B).\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on the precise nature of the\nchanges that occur in RNA conformation when the pH is lowered,\nand how pH influences the sRNA degree of ionization. Biologically,\nhybridization occurs naturally in acidic conditions and promotes\nthe neutralization of the condensed phosphate molecules [33]. In\nvitro, this occurs with a pH below 5 and can result in depurination,\nbase pair protonation, adenine, uracil, and cytosine unstacking, and\nthus degradation of RNA [33].\n\n3.3. UV and agarose gel electrophoresis\n\nIn order to determine the optimal complexation conditions, it is\nnecessary to evaluate the degree of binding between sRNA and\npolycation at different N/P ratios. The polycations were mixed with\nsRNA at several ratios for the formation of sRNA\u2013polycation parti-\ncles (polyplexes) in acetate buffer at pH 4.5 [14]. The pH 4.5 value\nwas chosen because it is located within the range of pH values\n(4\u20136) that has been attributed to the endo/lysosomal compartment\n\n[34]. Moreover, at this pH, the amine groups of polycations in study\nare protonated and act as a cationic polyelectrolyte that can inter-\nact with the negatively charged sRNA. In Table 1, it is possible to\nobserve that the polycations possess pKa values higher than those\nof the RNA phosphate groups. The degree of compaction between\nsRNA and all polycations in study are analyzed by gel agarose elec-\ntrophoresis (Fig. 3) and by UV spectrometry (Fig. 4). In preliminary\nstudies, N/P ratio values in the range of 0.625\u201350 were studied for\nall the selected polycations (data not shown). In this range, an\nintermediate region was found for each polycation, where most\nof the sRNA molecules are partially condensed, followed by com-\nplete condensation of the sRNA at higher concentrations of\npolycation.\n\nRegarding the PEI, it was observed that the bands corresponding\nto free sRNA in the PEI-LMW/sRNA complex were not observed\nwhen the polymer was present at the N/P ratio above 3, (Fig. 3A).\nIn accordance with the results obtained from electrophoresis,\n100% of sRNA loading efficiency was achieved at the N/P ratio 3\u2013\n4 and, at this point, sRNA is completely complexed with PEI-\nLMW (Fig. 4). In the case of the PEI-HMW/sRNA complex\n(Fig. 3B), no suppression of sRNA was identified in those complexes\nwith N/P ratios of 1.25\u20132.5, while sRNA migration in complexes\nwith N/P ratios higher than 2.5 was not observed. These results\nwere also observed in the encapsulation studies, in which 97% of\nthe sRNA loading efficiency was obtained, for the 3\u20133.5 N/P ratios\n(Fig. 4). In comparison, the two PEIs in study display subtle differ-\nences in the sRNA condensation. In general, however, PEI-HMW\nseems to be more efficient in sRNA condensation. It is known that\npolycations with higher charge densities promote the strongest\nbinding with RNA [10, 12, 32, 33]. However, it should be stressed\nthat the degree of compaction depends also on the size of the po-\nsitive chains, and on their number, for a constant charge ratio [35].\nIn Table 3 are listed the main differences between these two poly-\ncations in terms of size and charge density. It is observed that the\ncharge density of PEI-LMW is higher than that of PEI-HMW, but the\nchain is longer and the degree of branching is higher in PEI-HMW.\nSome previous studies have also pointed out that a branched struc-\nture may promote a more efficient interaction with sRNA, when\n\nFig. 2.

Pereira et al. / Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 387 (2012) 84\u201394\n\n193\n\n\n\ncompared to a linear polymer structure, which may be beneficial\nfor the packaging of sRNA [36,37].\n\nIn a second set of experiments, we have used two types of chito-\nsan polymers. The characteristics of the different commercial\nchitosan (CS-LMW and CS-MMW) used in this work are shown in\nTable 1. MW and DD are the molecular weight and the deacetyla-\ntion degree, respectively. The DD was measured by a first deriva-\ntive UV-spectroscopy (1DUVS) method, using a Shimadzu 1700\nUV\u2013vis spectrophometer [38]. The DD values represent the per-\ncentage of deacetylated primary amine groups along the molecular\nchain, which subsequently determines the positive charge density\nwhen chitosan is dissolved in acidic conditions (pH ? 5.5) [38]. In\nthe presence of CS-LMW at an N/P ratio of 15\u201325, sRNA migrated\nalong the gel, which indicates the presence of non-complexed\nsRNA (Fig. 3C). For higher N/P ratios, around 30, the presence of\npolyplexes in the wells (neutralized sRNA) is observed, suggesting\n\nsRNA is fully complexed. In the case of CS-MMW at N/P ratios of\n10\u201335, sRNA also migrated into the gel but at a N/P ratio above\n35 the sRNA is neutralized (Fig. 3D). In Fig. 3D, it is possible to ob-\nserve that, at the N/P ratio 20\u201345, some polyplexes move in the\ndirection of the anode, that is, some polyplexes present an excess\nof positive charge. It was clear that the efficiency of the polycation\ncondensation and the charge distribution inside the polyplex is\nknown to depend on the distance between the charges in the con-\ndensing agent. This reflects the fact that both linear charge density\nand the relative number of chains of the condensing agent are\nimportant factors in the condensation behavior. Overcharging\neffects have been previously observed in similar systems, and over-\ncharging is favored in situations where a concentrated solution of\npolycation is added to the polyanion solution [39,40].\n\nFinally in the presence of PAA, sRNA complexation starts at very\nlow values of the N/P ratio. This condensation becomes more\n\nFig. 3. Binding efficiency of sRNA/polymer polyplexes at various N/P ratios.

The results obtained for\nPAA/sRNA encapsulation are in agreement with those from agarose\ngel electrophoresis, where a 25.6% of sRNA loading efficiency was\nachieved at the N/P ratio of 0.7 and the highest N/P ratio was\n85% for an N/P ratio of 0.8 (Fig. 4). These observations indicate that\nthis polycation, which possesses an intermediate size and charge\ndensity, as compared with the others used in this work, is very effi-\ncient in sRNA condensation. An illustration from the molecular\nmechanics calculations (see Fig. 1) suggests that the charges of\nthe PAA are more accessible than those in the PEI chains. Also, a\nhigh degree of charge matching between PAA and sRNA [41] is a\ndefinite possibility. In fact, charges in PAA are separated by ca.\n3.4 \u00c5 (Table 3) yielding a charge density close to that of sRNA.\n\n3.4. Structural properties\n\nThe physical properties such as size and surface charge that\ninfluence cellular interactions and polyplex biodistribution were\nalso determined. The results of zeta potential and size of polyplex-\nes are shown in Table 4. In general, an increase in the charge of the\ncomplexes, for all systems in study, is observed upon the addition\nof polymers. The size of sRNA, in the absence of polycation, is\n325 nm in diameter. The initial size of the sRNA molecules is re-\nduced when the N/P ratio increases, up to a minimum value, after\nwhich the chains tend to expand again. It is also observed that the\nlowest size of the complexes obtained with CS is slightly higher\nthan that obtained with the PEI chains. In turn, PAA reaches the\nlowest size value. Also, PAA complexes at 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 N/P\nratios are smaller than 150 nm, which is considered the size limit\nfor nonspecific endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits [42]. In the case\nof PEI and PAA it is seen that the zeta potential increases gradually,\nfrom negative to positive values (Table 4). The complexes formed\nwith sRNA and the two PEIs at N/P ratio of 2.5 displayed small neg-\native zeta potentials. These results are in accordance with the re-\nsults obtained in the electrophoresis (Fig. 3) and in the\nencapsulation studies (Fig. 4) at the N/P ratio 2.5, indicating that,\nat this point, RNA is not fully complexed with the polycation. These\nresults may be due to the fact that most of the positively charged\nPEI chains in sRNA/PEI complexes were closely covered with the\n\nstrongly anionic RNA. For CS chains, the zeta potential values are\npositive also in the region where condensation occurs. These corre-\nspond to a higher N/P ratio values than for the other polymers. In\nthis range, the zeta potential value is almost constant in the case of\nCS-LMW, and is only slightly increasing for CS-HMW. As noted, PEI\nand CS promote sRNA condensation at very different N/P ratios.\nThis can be ascribed to the marked difference of charge density be-\ntween these two classes (see Table 3). However, comparable sizes\nand surface charges are obtained in the condensation regions.\nAgain, PAA, that possesses an intermediate size and charge densi-\nties, leads to the smaller complexes.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations (Table 2) were performed to explain\nthe trends observed (see Fig. 5). In the simulation, a charge ratio\nclose to 1 corresponds to the existence of neutral complexes. The\nfocus of the simulation is to assess the influence of charge density\nand size of polymer in the polyanion compaction. As such, the\nshorter chains possess a higher charge density, and in the longer\nones, the charge density is decreased, so as to mimic the differ-\nences between the polycations used in the experimental part. It\nis observed that, while the highest density chains promote the\nhigher degree of compaction, for a constant linear charge density\n(LCD), the longer chains are the more effective. This means that,\nin some cases, a decrease in linear charge density may be compen-\nsated by an increase in size, in what concerns compaction effi-\nciency. This is consistent with the experimental observations, in\nwhich chitosan (long and intermediate-LCD), longer but less\ndensely charged, attains a similar degree of compaction of that at-\ntained by PEI (Short-HCD and Intermediate-MCD). Also, PEI is more\ndensely charged but shorter than the more efficient PAA. Naturally,\nthese observations should also take into account more detailed\nstructural aspects, leading to charge matching of charge accessibil-\nity, as referred above. The importance of charge density and charge\nlocalization has been also emphasized in the interaction of oppo-\nsitely charged microgel-peptide systems [43].\n\nThe simulation also shows additional structural differences in\nthe polyplexes, apart from those observed in the distribution of\nthe radii of gyration (Fig. 5). In the presence of the polycation with\nlonger chain length, the polyanion is neutralized and totally sur-\nrounded by the oppositely charged chains (Fig. 6). On the other\nhand, with shorter and highly charged polycation chains, the\npolyanion is condensed but more exposed to the outside. These\nobservations can suggest an explanation for the positive charge\nof all CS-sRNA polyplexes studied, which is higher than that found\nfor the remaining systems.\n\nSEM was used to determine the morphology of the particles ob-\ntained with the different polycations. Independently of the polyca-\ntion used, polyplexes displayed a very well defined spherical and\nuniform morphology (Fig. 7A\u2013E).\n\nTable 4\nAverage zeta potential and size at various N/P ratios of sRNA and polycation (PEI-\nLMW, PEI-HMW, CS-LMW, CS-MMW and PAA).

Stability of sRNA in polyplexes\n\nRNA must be stable to digestion by nuclease so as to have max-\nimal activity in the cells [9]. As such, to assess if an appropriate\nprotection of sRNA is promoted by complexation with the polyca-\ntion, stability studies, for the systems displaying higher encapsula-\ntion efficiency, were performed using RNase and FBS. The results\nobtained are shown in Figs. 8 and 9, respectively. The UVIband\u2014\n1D gel analysis software (Uvitec, Cambridge, UK) was again used\nas an auxiliary of the agarose electrophoresis allowing to control\nthe degradation of sRNA.\n\nIn the case of PEI-LMW polyplexes, sRNA degradation was ob-\nserved at a 10 and 100 lg/mL enzyme concentration over a period\nof 1 h at 37 ?C, for all N/P ratios studied (Fig. 8A, lane 3\u20138). sRNA\ndegradation was also observed for PAA (Fig. 8C) polyplexes at all\nN/P ratios in study while for PEI-HMW polyplexes, it was only ob-\nserved when N/P = 4 (Fig. 8A, lane 9\u201314). Regarding the protection\npromoted in the nanoparticulated systems, it should be noted that\nneither sRNA in the polyplexes produced with CSs nor PEI-HMW\n\nshowed signs of degradation when in contact with RNase\n(Fig. 8B). These results were confirmed by the intensity of the\nbands in each condition by value of peak volume, since the inten-\nsity peaks correspond to degraded RNA. PEI-LMW/sRNA complexes\nwere less stable than PEI-HMW complexes at all charge ratios, with\n59% maximal dissociation achieved with 100 lg/mL RNase. There-\nfore, PEI-HMW/sRNA complexes were more stable than the PEI-\nLMW/sRNA complexes, with 9.5% maximal dissociation achieved\nwith 100 lg/mL RNase for N/P = 4. PAA/sRNA complexes achieved\n16% dissociation, and, therefore, were less stable than the PEI-\nHMW/sRNA complexes. Thus, the structure of sRNA seems to be\ncomplexed more loosely in PEI-LMW polyplexes and, hence, RNase\npartially degrades the sRNA in the two enzyme concentrations,\nwhereas PEI-HMW and CSs provide a complete protection\n(Fig. 8A and B).\n\nSimilar results were obtained when the polyplexes were incu-\nbated with 10% of FBS at 37 ?C for 30 and 60 min (Fig. 9A\u2013C). As\nshown in Fig. 9A, the degraded sRNA was visualized by the appear-\nance of the sRNA bands in the lanes 3\u20138 of the PEI-LMW/sRNA\n\nFig. 6.

On the other hand, sRNA complexed with the other\npolymers does not show any signs of degradation, even after incu-\nbating with 10% FBS for 1 h at 37 ?C, whereas the free sRNA rapidly\ndegrades after 30 min of incubation at 37 ?C (as shown by the com-\nplete absence of sRNA bands in the gel in wells 1). It should be\nnoted that the band of the lane 2 results of FBS as shown in the\ncontrol FBS gel (Fig. 9A\u2013C, lane 2). PEI-LMW/sRNA complexes at\nall N/P ratios tested, from 3.5 to 5, were very sensitive to FBS with\n75% maximal dissociation. In general, these results revealed that\nPEI-HMW, CS-LMW, CS-MMW and PAA nanoparticles are able to\nprotect sRNA from nuclease degradation (Fig. 9A \u2013 lanes 9\u201315; B\nand C), suggesting that they are suitable delivery vehicles for\nin vitro and in vivo gene delivery applications.\n\nThe dissociation properties of the polyplexes were evaluated\nthrough heparin/polyanion competition assay. Polyplexes can suf-\nfer unwanted modifications when interacting with large polyani-\nons found outside cells, such as sulfated glycosaminoglycans and\nproteoglycans during the transfer membrane, since they have pos-\nitively charged surfaces, which may affect the integrity and the\nmobility of the polyplexes [13,20]. For this reason, it is important\nto measure the capability of complexes for sRNA delivery through\nthe polyanion competition assay. Heparin is a polysaccharide neg-\natively charged bearing sulfonate groups that compete with the\nnucleic acids, leading to dissociation. For this purpose, polyplexes\nare incubated with varying amounts of heparin (0.01, 0.1 and\n0.5 IU/mL) to induce the decomplexation of the sRNA within the\ncomplexes, prior to separation on agarose gels (Fig. 10A\u2013E). All\nthe PEI-LMW/sRNA complexes are unstable in the presence of hep-\narin (Fig. 10A). PEI-LMW/sRNA complexes achieved 10.7% maximal\ndissociation, after incubation with heparin. So, these results\nindicate that PEI-HMW/sRNA complexes are more stable than\nPEI-LMW/sRNA complexes at all charge ratios, in the presence of\nheparin (Fig. 10A and B). The results obtained are in accordance\nwith Kwok and Hart [44]. Furthermore, sRNA maintained stable\ncomplexes with CS-LMW and CS-MMW, even in the presence of\nhigh concentrations of heparin (Fig. 10C and D). The PAA/sRNA\ncomplexes formulated at a N/P ratio of 1.0 and 1.1 dissociated even\nwith trace amounts of heparin (Fig. 10E). For PAA/sRNA complexes\nformulated at N/P ratios of 1.0 and 1.1, 13.7% and 2.9% maximal\ndissociation was achieved, respectively, after incubation with\n0.5 IU/mL heparin. Overall, the results concerning the incubation\nwith heparin for a period of 1 h indicate that PEI-LMW and PAA\ncomplexes are more strongly affected by heparin than PEI-HMW\nand CS complexes, and it is also expected that they have a lower\nefficiency in transfer of the cell membrane. Except for that with\nPAA, polyplexes that are more sensitive to RNase degradation are\nalso more prone to decompaction by heparin. Also, longer polyca-\ntions seem to promote a higher degree of protection.\n\nThe ability to dissociate in the presence of heparin reveals the\npotential to dissociate within the cell, releasing the nucleic acid,\nwhile providing sufficient stability outside the cells to protect\nand preserve the size and integrity of the acid nucleic complex.\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nRNA interference technology is emerging as a powerful tool for\nin vivo research, both to address questions of basic biology and the\nneeds of drug development formulations. Their successful applica-\ntion depends on optimizing physicochemical properties such as\nsize, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency and complex stability\nof the carriers. The PEI-LMW/sRNA complexes showed smaller\nsizes and a higher encapsulation efficiency (100%). However, they\nwere not stable in the presence of RNase, FBS and heparin. On\nthe other hand, the PEI-HMW/sRNA complexes indicate good\nencapsulation efficiency, small sizes and stability in the presence\n\nof FBS and heparin. The CS/sRNA particles exhibited positive zeta\nvalues in the relevant range of N/P ratios tested, with size values\nof ca. 200 nm, and good stability in the presence of RNase, heparin\nand FBS. Additionally, they display high values for the encapsula-\ntion efficiency. Finally, the PAA/sRNA polyplexes presented the\nsmaller size, good encapsulation efficiency and high stability in\nmimetized physiological conditions. We recall that PAA is, how-\never, known to be cytotoxic. Apart from the differences between\nthe structures of the polycations used, it was observed that it is\npossible to produce polyplexes with similar structural properties,\nsuch as size and potential zeta. Thus, from the polyplexes devel-\noped in this work, chitosan complexes seem to be the most prom-\nising vehicles for application in RNA therapeutic.\n\nIn a more general sense, results have also shown that a longer\npolycation with low charge density may induce a similar degree\nof condensation of that of a shorter polycation with a high linear\ncharge density.

Studies demonstrated that the miR-29 expression is decreased in Alzheimer's \n\ndisease (AD) patients displaying high levels of human ?-secretase (hBACE1). Recent advances \n\ntoward an effective therapy for AD intend to employ miR-29 to suppress hBACE1 expression \n\nand subsequent Amyloid-? (A?) peptide. However, delivery of mature miRNA has \n\ndemonstrated modest efficacy in vitro; therefore, the preparation of highly pure and \n\nbiologically active pre-miRNA arises as one of the most important challenges in the \n\ndevelopment of these therapeutic strategies. Recently, we described a new strategy based \n\narginine-affinity chromatography to specifically purify the recombinant pre-miR-29b. \n\nFollowing this strategy, the purified pre-miR-29b was successfully encapsulated into \n\npolyplexes that were further delivered in cytoplasm. It was verified that Chitosan/pre-miR-\n\n29b and Polyethylenimine/pre-miR-29b systems efficiently delivered pre-miR-29b to N2a695 \n\ncells, thus reducing the hBACE1 protein expression (around 78% and 86%, respectively) and \n\nA?42 levels (approximately 44% and 47%, respectively). Furthermore, pre-miR-29b \n\ndownregulates the hBACE1 mRNA expression in 80%. Overall, it was demonstrated that the \n\nrecombinant pre-miR-29b using polyplexes allowed to decrease the hBACE1 and A?42 \n\nexpression levels, improving the currently available methodologies of miRNA-based \n\ntherapeutics. \n\n \n\nKeywords  \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease; hBACE1; Amyloid-?; Chitosan; Polyethylenimine; Polyplexes; \n\nRecombinant pre-miR-29b;  \n\n\n\n \n\n 206 \n\n\n\n \n\n 207 \n\nIntroduction \n\nOver the past decade, several hundred small non-coding regulatory RNA molecules, known as \n\nmicroRNAs (miRNAs), have been identified as potential biomarkers and therapeutic \n\nproducts1,2. Briefly, miRNAs are initially transcribed as pri-miRNAs from the regions of the \n\ngenome that are subsequently processed by the Drosha into pre-miRNAs stem-loop. Then, pre-\n\nmiRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm where they are converted into mature miRNAs after \n\nthe removal of their loops by Dicer. Finally, one strand of the miRNA duplex (called mature \n\nmiRNA sequence) is loaded onto the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and, posteriorly, \n\nbinds to specific sites typically present in the 3\u2019 untranslated region (3\u2019UTR) of messenger \n\nRNA (mRNA), leading to translational inhibition with imperfect base pairing or, less \n\nfrequently, to the mRNA degradation with perfect base pairing1,3-6. An important feature of \n\nthese RNAs is that an individual miRNA can regulate multiple mRNA targets and, \n\nconsequently, can induce multiple effects on the expression of several related genes \n\nfamilies3. Accordingly, it is likely that miRNAs are directly involved in a variety of cellular \n\nprocesses, namely in cell cycle regulation, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, stress \n\nresponse and metabolism5,9. Thus, the unveiling of the role of several miRNAs present in \n\ncellular processes is critical to develop new diagnosis methods or drugs for understanding and \n\ntreating illnesses. To date, there are over 1880 miRNAs that have been discovered in humans, \n\namong which the miR-29 remains as one of the most interesting and intriguing miRNA \n\nfamilies, once the dysregulation of this miRNA has a strong impact on many diseases including \n\nmultiple types of cancers10-14 and neurodegenerative15-19 disorders, suggesting that it can be a \n\npromising target in the therapeutic of these diseases.  \n\nRecently, several studies have been published concerning the expression of miR-29 in patients \n\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)20,25,26, suggesting that this biomolecule can play an important \n\nrole in the regulation of this neurodegenerative disease. The generation and subsequent \n\naccumulation of amyloid-? peptides (A?) is a histological characteristic that is strongly \n\nimplicated in the pathogenesis of AD22-24. One of the mechanisms that contribute to the \n\naccumulation of A? is sequential proteolytic cleavages of full-length amyloid precursor \n\nprotein (APP) by ?-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), being \n\nconsidered as a prime drug target for therapeutic inhibition of A? production in AD25. Hence, \n\nthe regulation of the proteins expression levels involved in the A? generation process has \n\ndemonstrated to be important in AD. Several research groups showed that the miR-29 is \n\npotentially involved in the regulation of APP and BACE1 expression because in vitro studies \n\nrevealed that in sporadic AD patients, displaying abnormally high BACE1 protein levels, the \n\nmiR-29 cluster was significantly decreased20, 23, 26. These findings provided support for a causal \n\nrelationship between miR-29 and AD, since the miR-29 suppresses the expression levels of \n\nhBACE1 and, consequently, A? peptides levels in neuronal cells16. Thus, miR-29 can be used as \n\na potential therapeutic weapon for pharmacological intervention of AD. \n\n\n\n \n\n 208 \n\nCommonly, the miRNAs used for therapeutic purposes have mostly been produced by chemical \n\nsynthesis (phosphoamidite chemistry, normally used for the generation of short \n\noligoribonucleotides), enzymatic synthesis (longer RNAs can be produced by in vitro \n\ntranscription) or via a plasmid (for miRNA expression into eukaryotic cell lines)26. Although \n\nthese methods can be very efficient in producing miRNA, in general, additional purification \n\nprotocols to remove the impurities (failure sequences, impurities of pDNA template, \n\nenzymes, nucleotides, salts or buffer) from the production process have to be employed. The \n\npresence of impurities may lead to non-targeted gene silencing, what is commonly associated \n\nwith a decrease in therapeutic effectiveness and still restrict the implementation of these \n\noligonucleotides onto clinical applications26,27. Furthermore, the purification methods usually \n\nemployed are still expensive, difficult to scale up and can cause degradation of the RNA \n\nmolecules due to the requirement of toxic solvents and use of denaturing conditions28. Thus, \n\nconsidering the rapidly growing interest on these novel biopharmaceuticals, as a result of its \n\npotential therapeutic application, novel technologies to improve their preparation are \n\ncurrently being pursued. \n\nThus, our research group recently proposed a new process for production and purification \n\nthrough amino acid-based affinity chromatography, of recombinant pre-miR-29b with \n\npotential therapeutic application29. This strategy could contribute for the establishment of \n\nreliable, simple and more cost-effective processes, easily adopted by biopharmaceutical \n\nindustries, while maintaining maximal product quality and biological activity. However, in \n\norder to improve the biological effect in RNAi-based therapies it is also essential the \n\ndevelopment of an efficient miRNA delivery system capable to overcome the biological \n\nbarriers, protect the integrity of miRNA and trapping miRNA in intracellular space to exert its \n\nfunction30. During the last decades, several research groups have focused on the production \n\nand characterization of polyplexes formed between sRNA and some cationic polymers such as \n\nPolyethylenimine (PEI)31-35 and Chitosan (CS)36-40. In general, these vehicles can be promising \n\nsystems to compact RNA for systemic delivery because they present a mean diameter of 200 \n\nnm, high stability, biocompatibility and proved to be useful in protecting the RNA against \n\nfetal bovine serum (FBS) and ribonuclease41. Furthermore, delivery by polyplexes has the \n\nadvantage of being more cost-effective. However, the high toxicity of PEI is one of the major \n\nlimiting factors especially for in vivo use. Polymers with low molecular weight (&lt;25KDa) \n\ndisplay low toxicity, but the transfection efficiency is low as well. It is commonly believed \n\nthat the most suitable molecular weight of PEI for gene transfer ranges between 5KDa and \n\n25KDa42,43. Thus, the main novelty of the present study is to report the application of the \n\nrecombinant pre-miR-29b in cells transfection to decrease the hBACE1 expression levels and, \n\nsubsequently the A? expression levels. Overall, the implementation of this cutting-edge \n\napproach provides the basis for the improvement of the currently available methodologies of \n\ngene silencing as a putative genetic therapy for AD and their implementation on \n\nbiopharmaceutical industry. \n\n\n\n \n\n 209 \n\nResults  \n\npre-miR-29b protection by polyplexes formulation and delivery to neuronal cells \n\nThe pre-miR-29 loaded polyplexes were formulated using the following conditions: CS/pre-\n\nmiR-29b with N/P ratio of 30 and to PEI/pre-miR-29b with N/P ratio of 3.5 (see Methods \n\nsection). Relevant parameters such as size, zeta potential and loading capacity were \n\ndetermined for the different polyplexes. Thus, as shown in Table 1, all of the polyplexes \n\ndemonstrated high encapsulation efficiency, small sizes and exhibited a strong positive \n\ncharge on their surface. \n\n \n\nTable 1 \u2013 Characterization of polyplexes.

Thus, in order to explore the effect of recombinant \n\npre-miR-29b administration, N2a695 cells were transfected with CS/pre-miR-29b, PEI/pre-\n\nmiR-29b and Lipo/pre-miR-29b using different concentrations of the pre-miR-29b (3.84, 6.32, \n\n8.72 and 9.9 nM).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 211 \n\n \n\nFigure 2 \u2013 Recombinant pre-miR-29b effect on BACE1 levels in N2a695 cells at different \n\nconcentrations of the pre-miR-29b for 72 h.

Quantification of fluorescence intensity for BACE1 protein expression in cells \n\ntransfected with: (B) CS/pre-miR-29b, (C) PEI/pre-miR-29b, and (D) Lipo/pre-miR-29b. All \n\nresults are expressed relatively to those in untreated cells and error bars represent standard \n\ndeviations derived from three or more independent experiments performed in triplicate. \n\nANOVA, mean\u00b1SD. \n\n \n\nConsistent with the Immunocytochemistry results, Western blot analysis revealed that \n\nendogenous hBACE1 protein levels were significantly reduced in the N2a695 cell line \n\ntransfected with polyplexes containing the recombinant pre-miR-29b, compared with the \n\nuntreated cells and cells transfected with an unrelated RNA control (Figs. 2 and 3), at 48 and \n\n\n\n \n\n 212 \n\n72 h. In addition, N2a695 cells were transfected with synthetic miR-29b (positive control) and \n\nscrambled RNA (negative control) (at a final concentration of 9.9 nM) (Fig. 3F). At 24 h after \n\ntransfection, no significant changes on the endogenous levels of hBACE1 protein were \n\ndetected when compared with untreated cells and cells transfected with the unrelated RNA \n\ncontrol (data not shown). On the other hand, 72 h after transfection, hBACE1 protein \n\nexpression was decreased by approximately 78% in cells transfected with CS/pre-miR-29b, \n\nand by 86% in those transfected by PEI/pre-miR-29b complexes (Figs. 2 and 3). In addition, in \n\nN2a695 cells, pre-miR-29b treatment caused concentration-dependent inhibition of hBACE1 \n\nexpression (Fig. 3). Thus, hBACE1 protein expression was significantly reduced following \n\ntransfection with both synthetic miR-29b (around 48% reduction) and recombinant pre-miR-\n\n29b (around 82% reduction) by comparing with the transfection of untreated cells (Fig. 3C).  \n\n \n\nFigure 3 \u2013Western blot analysis of endogenous hBACE1 and ?-actin levels in the cell lysate of \n\nN2a695 cells treated with different concentrations of pre-miR-29b, at 24, 48 and 72 h.

(For simplicity \n\npurposes, the blots were cropped and the representative images are shown). \n\n\n\n \n\n 213 \n\nTherefore, endogenous hBACE1 levels are significantly inhibited by pre-miR-29b delivery in \n\nN2a695. To confirm the antibody specificity, the primary antibody anti-BACE1 was blocked \n\nwith BACE1 peptide, by incubation at RT during 4 h. As demonstrated by Fig. 2A, fluorescence \n\nwas not detected in the confocal microscopy image, indicating that the antibody binds to \n\nBACE1 in N2a695 cells, proving the high specificity of antibody to hBACE1.  \n\nPre-miR-29b inhibits hBACE1 translation and affect hBACE1 mRNA level \n\nFollowing the evaluation of the effect of the transfection of N2a695 cells with polyplexes \n\nloaded with recombinant pre-miR-29b on hBACE1 protein levels through Immunocytochemistry \n\nand Western-blot analysis, it was also evaluated its effect on hBACE1 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR \n\nmeasurements. As expected, RT-qPCR results (Fig. 4) revealed that hBACE1 mRNA levels in \n\nN2a695 cells were also significantly reduced after treatment with CS/pre-miR-29b and \n\nPEI/pre-miR-29b relatively to untreated cells and cells transfected with the unrelated RNA \n\ncontrol (Fig. 4). As a matter of fact, miRNAs can regulate gene expression through either \n\ntranslational suppression, mRNA degradation or both. Data analysis showed that CS/pre-miR-\n\n29b 6.32 nM significantly decreased hBACE1 mRNA expression to 76.4\u00b10.6% (Fig. 4A) relatively \n\nto N2a695 cells treated with PEI/pre-miR-29b 8.72 nM (77.9\u00b14.5%), at 72 h of transfection \n\n(Fig. 4B). At 48 h after transfection, a significant reduction of hBACE1 mRNA levels was also \n\nverified, being 48.5\u00b14.4% and 53.8\u00b18.1%, respectively for CS/pre-miR-29b 3.84 nM and \n\nPEI/pre-miR-29b 9.9 nM (Figs. 4A and 4B). Furthermore, it was also performed RT-qPCR for \n\nRNA from N2a695 cells transfected with scrambled RNA or with synthetic miR-29b, at 24, 48 \n\nand 72 h (Fig. 4C). As expected, hBACE1 mRNA levels were also decreased in comparison with \n\nuntreated control and cells transfected with an unrelated RNA control, in the cells \n\ntransfected with synthetic miR-29b (41.3\u00b13.6%), at 72 h (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, hBACE1 \n\nmRNA levels were unaffected in cells transfected with scrambled RNA (Fig. 4C). Thus, the \n\ndecrease in hBACE1 protein levels is likely due to a decrease in hBACE1 mRNA stability or by \n\nreducing the transcription rate since we found by RT-qPCR that the level of hBACE1 mRNA \n\nwas also decreased by recombinant pre-miR-29b and synthetic miR-29b delivery (Fig. 4)50. \n\nFurthermore, the correlation between hBACE1expression and pre-miR-29b provides further \n\nsupport for the hypothesis that pre-miR-29b contributes, at least in part, to overall changes \n\nin hBACE1 expression in AD. Taken together, these data demonstrate effective delivery of \n\nrecombinant pre-miR-29b to N2a695 cells using polyplexes and that a specific suppression of \n\nhBACE1 expression occurs when these polyplexes delivered pre-miR-29b.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 214 \n\n \n\nFigure 4 \u2013 Effect of recombinant pre-miR-29b on hBACE1 mRNA levels in N2a695 cells \n\nfollowing 24, 48 and 72 h treatment with: (A) CS/pre-miR-29b and (B) PEI/pre-miR-29b (C) \n\nSynthetic miR-29b and Scrambled RNA.

Interestingly, by Immunocytochemistry \n\nanalysis it was found that when the endogenous A?total peptides are secreted, they \n\naccumulate around the nucleus leading to its deformation, appearing like a kidney (Fig. 5A).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 215 \n\n \n\nFigure 5 \u2013 Effect of recombinant pre-miR-29b on modulation of A? levels in N2a695 cells.

All results are expressed relative to those in untreated cells and presented \n\nas mean values from at least 3 independent experiments. ANOVA, mean\u00b1SD. \n\n \n\nThus, to directly examine whether recombinant pre-miR-29b also reduces endogenous A?42 \n\nlevels, the N2a695 cells (Fig. 5A) were transfected according to the best transfection \n\nconditions mentioned above (CS/pre-miR-29b and PEI/pre-miR-29b at 8.72/9.9 and 6.32/8.72 \n\nnM, respectively) to reduce the expression of hBACE1. A?42 levels in culture medium and in \n\ncell lysates were analyzed using ELISA (Fig. 5B). However, it was verified that A?42 could only \n\nbe detected in medium but was absent in cell lysate of the transfected cells. As a result, \n\n\n\n \n\n 216 \n\nendogenous A?42 levels were significantly reduced by 45.2\u00b16.0% and 40.07\u00b11.3% with CS/pre-\n\nmiR-29b 8.72 and 9.9 nM, respectively. With PEI/pre-miR-29b 6.32 and 8.72 nM, the \n\nendogenous A?42 levels were reduced by 47.2\u00b111.4% and 31.31\u00b14.7%, respectively, when \n\ncompared to N2a695 untreated cells at 72 h (Fig. 5B). Therefore, endogenous A?42 levels were \n\ninhibited by recombinant pre-miR-29b in this neuronal cell line. Once again, these findings \n\nindicate that recombinant pre-miR-29b regulates A?42 production through mechanisms \n\ndependent of hBACE1 expression. \n\n \n\nDiscussion \n\nBACE1 and A? are central players in the pathways implicated in AD, it has been established \n\nthat reducing BACE1 expression has been suggested as a potential strategy for mitigating the \n\npathological processes underlying AD25,46. Interestingly, the miR-29a/b-1/c cluster is \n\nsignificantly decreased in the brains of AD patients, and this decrease is correlated with the \n\nincreased level of BACE1 protein16,21. Previously published studies have demonstrated the \n\nimportance of using the miR-29 family as a potential major suppressor to silence BACE1 \n\nprotein expression. However, the success of any therapeutic strategy depends on the \n\ndevelopment of economic, effective and efficient methods for miRNAs large-scale production \n\n(recombinant production using prokaryotic hosts) and purification, as an alternative to in \n\nvitro transcription or chemical synthesis29. The global interest is to produce high quantities of \n\nmiRNA but also to obtain and preserve its quality, fulfilling the requirements of regulatory \n\nagencies. To accomplish this purpose, we recently described a novel purification methodology \n\nbased on arginine-affinity chromatography to selectively purify the pre-miR-29b from \n\ndifferent RNA species with high recovery yield, purity and good integrity, revealing to be an \n\nefficient and reproducible technique to obtain an appropriate RNA quality with potential \n\napplicability for transfection studies29. Arginine was selected because it is a conserved amino \n\nacid of the active center of the PAZ domains of the Argonaute proteins, belonging to the \n\nRISC, suggesting that they have an important role in the specific recognition of the 3\u2019UTR of \n\nthe pre-miRNA47. \n\nOn the other hand, the development of an efficient miRNA delivery system capable to \n\novercome the biological barriers, protect the integrity of miRNA from degradation, promote \n\ncellular uptake and, finally, release miRNA in the cytoplasmic compartment is crucial to \n\nachieve an improvement in the biological effect in RNAi-based therapies. Hence, according to \n\nprevious results obtained by our research group43, we decided to explore the possibility of \n\nusing polycations-based carrier systems to efficiently deliver the recombinant pre-miR-29b to \n\nN2a695 neuronal cell line, to suppress hBACE1 expression. The polyplexes developed have not \n\na significant cytotoxicity effect of on the selected cell line (Fig. 1). An important in vitro \n\nexperimental approach in this study is the use of a stable N2a695 cell line because in these \n\ncells there is a constitutive endogenous hBACE1 expression, enabling greater sensitivity for \n\n\n\n \n\n 217 \n\nevaluating the direct or indirect effect of recombinant pre-miR-29b on the cellular levels of \n\nhBACE1 or on the products of its activity (A?42 peptides), once in biological systems over-\n\nexpressing hBACE1 leads to the formation A? peptides20,44,45. \n\nAlong with the role that pre-miR-29b plays in the regulation of the BACE1 levels, it was also \n\nevaluated the involvement of this miRNA in the functional regulation of the amyloid pathway. \n\nAs a matter of fact, in this study and for the first time, it was demonstrated that the \n\noverexpression of recombinant pre-miR-29b induces a marked decrease in the levels of the \n\nprotein hBACE1 and, consequently, a significant decrease in the level of the endogenous A?42. \n\nThis result suggests that the application of pre-miR-29 lead to a significant decrease in the \n\nlevels of two major risk factors commonly associated with the neurodegeneration in AD. We \n\nfurther verified that a single treatment with CS/pre-miR-29b or PEI/pre-miR-29b dramatically \n\ndecreased the amount of hBACE1 expression (suppressed in 78.5\u00b14.5% and 86.1\u00b11.2%, \n\nrespectively) and the generation of A?42 peptide (44.2\u00b16.0% and 47.2\u00b111.4%, respectively) by \n\ndownregulating hBACE1 protein in N2a695 cells (Figs. 2, 3 and 5). These findings reinforce the \n\nfact that the ability of recombinant pre-miR-29b to regulate endogenous hBACE1 protein \n\nexpression is likely direct, because it binds to the 3\u2019 UTR of hBACE1 mRNA, complementary to \n\nthe miR-29b seed region (Fig. 4). Our results demonstrated that hBACE1 mRNA levels were \n\nalso significantly altered following recombinant pre-miR-29b transfection, suggesting a post-\n\ntranscriptional mechanism that involves direct degradation/destabilization of hBACE1 mRNA \n\nand is likely that it promotes inhibition of hBACE1 protein translation. With these results it \n\nwas verified that hBACE1 is a direct target of pre-miR-29b (Figs. 2, 3 and 4), which was \n\nfurther validated by the downregulation of hBACE1 gene expression by polycations/pre-miR-\n\n29b in vitro.  \n\nOur findings, together with those from other groups, suggest a fundamental role of miR-29 in \n\nAD, and emphasize the potential application of miR-29 in prognosis prediction and AD \n\ntherapy. With the successful implementation of this methodology and comparing with \n\npreviously published data (~62% to miR-339-5p46; ~35% to miR-29c21; ~50% to miR-29a/b-116),  \n\nwe obtained the highest decrease ever reported for the hBACE1 expression levels (around 78% \n\nto CS/pre-miR-29b and 86% to PEI/pre-miR-29b) in AD model cells. In addition, it was also \n\nverified a decrease of the endogenous A?42 levels (approximately 44% to CS/pre-miR-29b and \n\n47% to PEI/pre-miR-29b) in these cells. Furthermore, the concentrations of recombinant pre-\n\nmiR-29b used in this study were much lower than those reported in other works using \n\nsynthetic miRNA (25 to 250 nM)16,21, thus a smaller amount of recombinant pre-miR-29b is \n\nrequired to obtain a higher silencing level of hBACE1. In fact, this result may be due to the \n\nfact that we are using recombinant pre-miRNA, which is more efficiently recognized and \n\nprocessed within the cell, instead of the mature form of miRNA or the fact that the pre-\n\nmiRNA was efficiently purified and delivered to the cell through its encapsulation with \n\npolycations48,49.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 218 \n\nOur results suggest that recombinant pre-miR-29b can represent a novel biopharmaceutical \n\nproduct for the therapeutic modulation of hBACE1 levels, once this study have new \n\nimplications for hBACE1 biology and offer a new perspective on the treatment of AD. \n\nAccording to the results obtained in this study, we developed an integrative platform that \n\nallows biosynthesis, purification and transfection of the recombinant pre-miR-29b using \n\npolyplexes to decrease the hBACE1 and endogenous A?42 expression levels. In addition, this \n\napproach allowed improving the currently available methodologies of miRNA-based \n\ntherapeutics, not only for neurological disorders but also for future therapeutic targets that \n\nmay be of potential clinical interest.  \n\n \n\nMethods \n\nReagents \n\nCS (Mw = 50\u2013190 kDa) and cell culture reagents were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich. PEI (Mw = \n\n10 kDa) was purchased from Polysciences. (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-\n\ncarboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) (MTS) was obtained from Promega. \n\nAnti-human BACE1 and BACE1 peptide (Abcam); anti-?-actin and monoclonal anti-?-Amyloid \n\n(Sigma-Aldrich); Hoechst 33342\u00ae, AlexaFluor 488\u00ae and AlexaFluor 546\u00ae (Invitrogen); Goat \n\nanti-rabbit/mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used. \n\nPre-miR-29b biosynthesis and purification by arginine affinity chromatography \n\nThe pre-miR-29b used in the experiments was produced in a bacterial cell culture of \n\nRhodovulum sulfidophilum DSM 1374 strain (BCCM/LMG, Belgium) modified with the plasmid \n\npBHSR1-RM containing the sequence of pre-miR-29b, as previously described by Pereira and \n\ncollaborators29. Then, the pre-miR-29b isolation was achieved using arginine as a specific \n\nligand in affinity chromatography29. The endotoxins content was also evaluated by using the \n\nToxinSensorTM Chromogenic Limulus Amoebocyte Lysate assay kit (GenScript), being verified \n\na considerably reduction during the chromatographic process, since the sample injected onto \n\nthe arginine matrix had 0.164 EU/\u00b5g of sRNA and the final pre-miR-29b fraction presented \n\n0.002 EU/\u00b5g of pre-miR-29b. Thus, the endotoxins level in the final pre-miR-29b sample \n\nconforms the guidelines of regulatory agencies like Food and Drug Administration (<0.06 \n\nEU/mL for the cerebrospinal fluid). In addition, the PCR product corresponding to the purified \n\npre-miR-29b was sequenced to confirm the identity and orientation of the amplicon (Figure S1 \n\nin Supporting Information). \n\nFormulation of polyplexes \n\nBriefly, all the pre-miR-29b loaded polyplexes were formulated using the method of simple \n\ncomplexation which is based on the electrostatic interactions that occur between molar \n\nconcentrations of positive charge, present in the protonated amine groups of each polycation \n\n(N), and the negative charge of the phosphate groups of RNA backbone (P), as described by \n\n\n\n \n\n 219 \n\nPereira and co-workers41. The pre-miR-29b (a final concentration of 2 \u00b5g/mL) and polycation \n\n(a concentration of 10 mg/mL) stock solutions were prepared in sodium acetate buffer (0.1 M \n\nsodium acetate/0.1 M acetic acid, pH 4.5). In order to promote encapsulation, cationic \n\npolymer solution (100 \u00b5L) was added dropwise to the pre-miR-29b solution (400 \u00b5L), under \n\nstirring during 30 s, to particle formation41. The PEI/pre-miR-29b molar ratio is 0.35:1 \n\n(mol/mol) and the CS/pre-miR-29b molar ratio is 3:1 (mol/mol). The formulated polyplexes \n\nwere incubated at RT for 30 min and then pelleted by centrifugation at 15000 g for 20 min. \n\nThe amount of unbound pre-miR-29b was quantified by UV spectrophotometry41. Thus, the \n\nencapsulation efficiency (EE) was determined using the following formula: EE%=[(Total pre-\n\nmiRNA amount \u2013 pre-miRNA supernatant amount)/Total pre-miRNA amount] x 100. Three \n\nrepetitions of this procedure were performed for each system. The hydrodynamic diameter \n\nand zeta potential of the pre-miR-29b-loaded polyplexes were determined by dynamic light \n\nscattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano ZS particle analyzer (Malvern Instruments, \n\nWorcestershire, UK), equipped with a He-Ne laser, at 25\u00baC. For DLS analysis particle samples \n\nwere produced as before mentioned and ressuspended in ultrapure water. Size \n\ncharacterization was performed in fully automatic mode and with a scattering angle of 173\u00b0. \n\nParticle zeta potential measurements were performed in disposable capillary cells and \n\ncomputed by using Henry\u2019s [F(Ka) 1.5], and Smoluchowsky models. All the data was examined \n\nin Zetasizer software v 7.03. The experiments were performed in triplicate and an average of \n\n30 measurements was acquired individually for each sample. As a positive control, \n\nLipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent was used (Lipo/pre-miR-29b), according to the \n\nprotocol recommended by the manufacturer. \n\nTransfection of N2a695 cells with polyplexes/pre-miR-29b \n\nN2a695 cells at passages 5-27 were cultured in the following medium: 1:1 mixture of \n\nDulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) and OptiMEM supplemented with 5% (wt/vol) \n\nheat-inactivated FBS and 1% (wt/vol) penicillin\u2013streptomycin48. N2a695 cells were seeded at \n\n3\u00d7104 cells/mL. When a 50 to 60% confluence was achieved, the culture medium was replaced \n\nby serum-free medium. After 12 h, CS/pre-miR-29b, PEI/pre-miR-29b and Lipofectamine/pre-\n\nmiR-29b (Lipo/pre-miR-29b) were added to the cells at pre-miR-29b concentration of 3.84 to \n\n9.9 nM and transfection was carried out during 6 h. The culture medium was replaced by \n\nfresh medium supplemented with 1% FBS and 1% antibiotic, to allow the cells to remain \n\nmetabolically active, expressing hBACE1 and A?. Untreated cells and cells transfected with an \n\nunrelated RNA (5\u2019-UGUGCAAAUCUAUGCAAAACUGA-3?) were used for negative controls (at a \n\nfinal concentration of 9.9 nM). In addition, cells were also transfected with scrambled miRNA \n\n(5?-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3?; 3?-TTAAGAGGCUUGCACAGUGCA-5?) and a synthetic miR-\n\n29b in the mature form (5?-UAGCACCAUUUGAAAUCAGUGUU-3\u00b4) using CS, as controls (at a \n\nfinal concentration of 9.9 nM). The cells were harvested 24, 48 and 72 h after transfection. \n\nAll transfection experiments were performed in triplicate. \n\n\n\n \n\n 220 \n\nMTS assay \n\nThe cellular cytotoxicity effect of the different formulations of polyplexes (CS and PEI/pre-\n\nmiR-29b) was evaluated using the Cell Titer 96\u00ae AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation \n\nAssay. Briefly, N2a695 cells were seeded at a density of 2\u00d7104 cells per well in a 96-well \n\nplate, 24 h after the cell culture medium was replaced by serum-free culture medium. Cells \n\nwere then transfected as described above and the MTS assay was performed at different time \n\npoints (48 and 72 h). Subsequently, the medium was exchanged, a mixture of MTS/phenazine \n\nmetasulfate (PMS) was added to each well, and cells were incubated during 4 h at 37\u00baC in a \n\nhumidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Following incubation, the absorbance \n\nmeasurements of the soluble brown formazan produced were performed in a microplate \n\nreader (Sanofi, Diagnostics Pauster) at 492 nm. All experiments were repeated at least three \n\ntimes. Cells incubated with absolute ethanol were used as positive control for cytotoxicity. \n\nImmunocytochemistry and Imaging Analysis \n\nN2a695 cells were seeded on glass coverslips into 12-well plates, to be recovered at 24, 48 \n\nand 72 h. After transfection with either Lipofectamine 2000 or polyplexes, the cells were \n\nfixed for 10 min at RT with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) buffer solution, followed by \n\npermeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Cell preparations were blocked for 1 h at \n\nRT with 20% FBS in PBS-Tween 20 (PBS-T). The cells were then incubated overnight at 4\u00baC \n\nwith the primary anti-hBACE1 polyclonal antibody (1:100) and anti-A?17-24 monoclonal \n\nantibody (1:1000). Then, cells were washed 6 times with PBS-T and incubated for 1 h at RT \n\nwith the appropriate fluorescence conjugated secondary antibodies AlexaFluor 488\u00ae goat \n\nanti-rabbit or AlexaFluor 546\u00ae goat anti-mouse. After washing, the nucleus were \n\ncounterstained with Hoechst 33342\u00ae (1:1000) for 10 min followed by 3 washing steps with \n\nPBS-T. Glass coverslips were mounted on slides and the preparations were visualized under a \n\nZeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., USA) equipped with a \n\nplane-apocromat 63\u00d7/DIC objective. Images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ \n\nsoftware.  \n\nWestern blot Analysis \n\nCells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS and homogenized in cell lysis buffer: 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer, \n\npH 7.4; 2.5 mM EDTA; 1% Triton X-100; 2.5 mM EGTA; 25 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride \n\nand complete EDTA Free protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Once homogenized, cell extracts \n\nwere centrifuged at 11500 rpm for 7 min at 4\u00baC. The total protein concentration in the \n\nsupernatant was determined using Bradford Protein Assay (BioRad) and 50 \u00b5g of total protein \n\nfrom each cell extract were boiled for 10 min in reducing buffer and then fractionated by \n\nelectrophoresis on 10% SDS-PAGE. After, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene \n\ndifluoride filter (PVDF) membranes and blocked with TBS-T (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 1.37 M \n\nNaCl; 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% BSA. Following, membranes were probed with \n\nprimary antibodies recognizing the hBACE1 (1:1000 in 5% BSA in TBS-T) and ?-actin (1:20000 in \n\n\n\n \n\n 221 \n\nTBS-T) at 4\u00baC overnight. After three washes with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with the \n\nHRP-labeled anti-rabbit/mouse IgG secondary antibody diluted 1:50000, followed by three \n\nwashes with TBS-T. Signal detection was performed with ECL substrate (BioRad) according to \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions and images were acquired with the ChemiDoc\u2122 XRS system \n\n(BioRad) and analysed with the Image Lab (BioRad).  \n\nExpression of BACE1 mRNA in N2a695 cells by RT-qPCR \n\nTotal RNA was extracted from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). 1 \u00b5g of total RNA \n\nwas reverse transcribed using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher \n\nScientific Inc.), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. For quantitative analysis, RT-\n\nqPCR amplification of cDNA was performed using the Maxima\u00ae SYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR \n\nMaster Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) in an IQ5 Cycler from BioRad. RT-qPCR efficiencies \n\nwere calculated from the given slopes with MyIQ 2.0 software (BioRad). The relative \n\nquantification of the BACE1 expression was based on the comparative threshold cycle (CT) \n\nmethod in which the amount of the target was determined to be 2-(?CT target - ?CT calibrator), \n\nnormalized to levels of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and relative to \n\nthe untreated control cells. The primers used in these experiments were 5\u2019-\n\nAGACGCTCAACATCCTGGTG-3\u2019 (forward) and 5\u2019-CCTGGGTGTAGGGCACATAC-3\u2019 (reverse) for \n\nthe amplification of human BACE (hBACE) and 5\u2019- TGACGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAA-3\u2019 (forward), \n\n5\u2019-AGTGTAGCCCAAGATGCCCTTCAG-3\u2019 (reverse) for the amplification of GAPDH. Each sample \n\nwas run in triplicate, and threshold cycle (CT) values were averaged from the triplicate. The \n\nfinal data were averaged from 3 separately conducted experiments. \n\nSandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) \n\nThe endogenous A?42 levels were quantified in the culture medium and in total cell lysates \n\nusing ELISA (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Total cell lysates were \n\nperformed as described for Western blot and the culture medium was centrifuged at 13000 \n\nrpm for 1 min to remove cell debris. Total cell lysates and culture medium were diluted 1:10 \n\nand A?42 concentrations were detected with an ELISA (Invitrogen), according to the \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. The results were expressed as referred to dilutions of standard \n\nsynthetic control peptides. In addition, absolute A?42 values (pg/ml) were measured and \n\nnormalized to total protein yield of crude cell lysates. \n\nStatistical analysis \n\nAll experiments were repeated at least three times using independent culture preparations. \n\nData in the figures are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard error. Quantitative data were \n\nstatistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by pair-wise \n\ncomparisons using the Fisher\u2019s least significant difference test. * indicate significant \n\ndifference versus untreated cells, # indicate significant difference versus cells transfected \n\nwith unrelated RNA control and ? indicate significant difference between samples, being \n\n\n\n \n\n 222 \n\nconsidered statistically significant for p<0.05. Statistical analysis was performed by using \n\nGraphPad Prism 6 software. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), \n\nthrough the project EXPL/BBB-BIO/1056/2012 and Pest-OE/SAU/UI0709/2014.

A dual-targeting drug delivery system \n\n(Chitosan (CS) or Polyethylenimine (PEI) conjugated with stearic acid (SA) and lactoferrin (Lf)) \n\nwas synthesized and its BBB penetration was evaluated. Stearic acid and lactoferrin were \n\nsuccessfully exploited as brain-targeting ligands to modify cationic polymers. The \n\nintracellular uptake of the delivery systems by neuronal cells was studied in vitro as well as \n\nthe gene silencing efficiency of pre-miR-29b. The CS/PEI-SA-Lf systems showed very strong \n\nfluorescence in the cytoplasm and cell nucleus, and were able to deliver pre-miR-29b to \n\nN2a695 cells in 1 hour after transfection. The experiment of transport across the BBB showed \n\nthat CS-SA-Lf delivered 65% of recombinant pre-miR-29b in a period of 4 hours, an higher \n\ntransport ratio than the 42% found for PEI-SA-Lf in the same time. The results indicate that \n\nCS-SA-Lf can be a potential pre-miR-29b carrier for AD therapy. \n\n \n\nKeywords  \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease; hBACE1; Chitosan; Polyethylenimine; Blood-Brain-Barrier; Recombinant \n\npre-miR-29b; Lactoferrin; Stearic Acid \n\n\n\n \n\n 232 \n\n\n\n \n\n 233 \n\n1. Introduction \n\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most common and devastating form of dementia in the elderly \n\nand can lead to death within 3 to 9 years after appearance of symptoms [1]. AD is \n\npathologically characterized by the progressive neuronal loss, mainly due to the accumulation \n\nof extracellular amyloid plaques consisting of aggregates of toxic amyloid-beta (A?) peptides \n\n[2-4]. They are generated through sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor \n\nprotein (APP) by ?-secretase (also known as ?-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)) and ?-\n\nsecretase, which play a pivotal role in the dysfunction and death of neurons [5-7]. Several \n\nconvincing evidences suggest that the regulation of expression of proteins involved in the \n\ngeneration and accumulation of A? peptides can be extremely important in AD, since A? \n\npeptides play the central role in initiating and development of the pathological cascade of AD \n\n[4, 5, 8, 9]. In the last years, several research groups demonstrated that the levels and \n\nactivity of BACE1 protein are elevated in sporadic AD brains, suggesting that BACE1 \n\ndysregulation is directly implicated in AD pathogenesis. For these reasons, BACE1 has been \n\nrecognized as a promising drug target for the therapy of this disease, once BACE1 inhibition \n\nmay decrease the formation of all forms of A? peptides in AD and, consequently, reduce cell \n\ndeath [10-12]. On the other hand, significant alterations in the expression of miR-29 family, \n\nin brains of AD patients, have been observed in most of studies [13, 14], being significantly \n\ndecreased and displaying abnormally high levels of BACE1 protein. These findings raised the \n\nopportunity to use miR-29 as a possible protective therapeutic strategy for the future of AD \n\ntherapy. The continued lack of progress in identifying effective diagnosis and treatment \n\nmodalities also contributes to higher health care costs and social burdens that are associated \n\nwith this disease [15-17].  \n\nOne of the reasons limiting the development of therapies for AD is the existence of a physical \n\nbarrier, the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB), which hinders the passage of most of the therapeutic \n\ndrugs from the circulating blood to the brain [18]. The BBB prevents the entry of harmful \n\nsubstances present in the systemic blood circulation into the brain, but allows the access of \n\nnecessary nutrients and chemical signaling molecules, making of the brain a place of poor \n\npermeability to various drugs [19-22]. Its function is related to the structural characteristics, \n\nonce the BBB is composed by tight intracellular junctions formed between adjacent brain \n\ncapillary endothelial cells [19]. On the other hand, the BBB possesses a variety of efflux \n\ntransporters, including P-glycoprotein [23], receptors for transferrin [24, 25], lactoferrin [26], \n\ninsulin [27], insulin-like growth factors [28], lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) [29, \n\n30], as well as, transmembrane monocarboxylic acid transporters and fatty acid transport \n\nproteins [31], reinforcing BBB function by effectively removing drugs from the brain and \n\npumping them back into blood.  \n\nAs a result, it is strictly necessary the development of methods that promote the delivery of \n\ntherapeutic drugs to the brain, safely and effectively. During the last decade, several non-\n\n\n\n \n\n 234 \n\nviral vectors were developed for brain targeting, including polymers (e.g. polyethyleneimine \n\n(PEI), chitosan (CS), poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), poly lactic acid (PLA)), polymeric \n\nmicelles, liposomes and dendrimers [32-37]. Among the vectors mentioned above, polymeric \n\ndelivery systems (polyplexes) have emerged as one of the most attractive carriers to cross the \n\nBBB and increase the uptake of appropriate drugs by the brain. To accomplish this, the \n\nreceptors existing on the BBB have been explored as a means to specifically target drugs to \n\nthe brain. This can be achieved through the surface modification of delivery systems with a \n\nligand (such as transferrin (Tf), lactoferrin (Lf), stearic acid (SA)) targeting to the receptor, \n\nwhich facilitates drug ability to interact with specific molecules expressed on the luminal side \n\nof BBB endothelial cells [38]. In the present study, the recombinant human pre-miR-29b was \n\nchosen as the therapeutic gene to be encapsulated in the polyplexes (CS or PEI) modified with \n\nLf and SA in the surface, to bind specifically to the Lf receptors on neuronal cells, through a \n\nreceptor-mediated pathway.  \n\nCS and PEI have gained much attention as delivery systems due to their advantageous \n\nproperties such as, ability to encapsulate large amounts of drug, high stability in biological \n\nfluids, targeting ability, rapid cellular uptake, high transfection efficiency, biocompatibility, \n\nbiodegradability, low cytotoxicity and immunogenicity, and reduced side effects by targeted \n\ndelivery [39-41]. In addition, the cationic charge of CS and PEI, due to the presence of amino \n\ngroups, allows the establishment of electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged \n\nRNAs, leading to an effective condensation and protection of the integrity of the RNA. In fact, \n\nthe encapsulation of RNAs prevents non-specific interactions and enzymatic degradation, \n\nincreasing the drug circulation in blood [39-41].  \n\nLf is a single chain iron-binding glycoprotein that belongs to the Tf family. Its concentration in \n\nthe blood plasma is low but is higher in BBB [42, 43]. Recent studies reported that the \n\ntransport of Lf across the BBB monolayer model was unidirectional and that there was a \n\nstrong affinity of positively charged Lf to Lf receptor, resulting in higher uptake of Lf-\n\nconjugated drug delivery systems to the brain comparing to Tf-modified NPs [26, 44]. For all \n\nthese reasons, Lf has been exploited as a promising brain-targeting ligand, facilitating drug \n\ndelivery into the brain. A previous study also described the ability of CS-SA for the delivery of \n\ndrugs into the brain and to avoid recognition by P-glycoprotein system, yielding an efficient \n\nbrain-targeting gene vector [38]. Thus, in the current study, it was explored the potential of \n\nthe polyplexes CS and PEI combined with two targeting substances, Lf and SA, to encapsulate \n\nrecombinant pre-miR-29b, and act as a brain-targeting delivery system. Various \n\nmeasurements, including 1H NMR and SDS-PAGE, were used to characterize and confirm the \n\nstructure of the modified polyplexes. The properties of the polyplexes CS-SA, CS-SA-Lf, PEI-SA \n\nand PEI-SA-Lf, such as the ability of transport across BBB model, the targeting effects, in \n\nvitro cell uptake and transfection studies were performed on N2a695, RBE4 and Z310 cells. \n\nThe efficacy of these systems was finally monitored by examining the induced BACE1 \n\ninhibition. \n\n\n\n \n\n 235 \n\n2. Materials and Methods \n\n2.1. Materials \n\nArginine\u2013Sepharose 4B gel was acquired from Amersham Biosciences. All buffers used for the \n\nchromatographic experiments were freshly prepared with 0.05% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) \n\ntreated water and were filtered through a 0.20 \u00b5m pore size membrane. Sodium chloride \n\n(NaCl) was purchased from Panreac and tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (Tris) from Sigma-\n\nAldrich. CS low molecular weight (LMW) (Mw=50\u2013190 kDa; degree of deacetylation in the 75\u2013\n\n85% range), Stearic acid Grade I (98.5%), Lactoferrin human, 2-Iminothiolane hydrochloride \n\n(2-IOT, 98%), 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and all cell culture media \n\nand reagents used in cell culture procedures were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich, unless \n\notherwise noted. PEI high molecular weight (HMW) (Mw=10 kDa) was acquired from \n\nPolysciences, Inc. (Warrington, PA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate isomer I (FITC), Hoechst \n\n33342\u00ae and AlexaFluor 488\u00ae were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, US). Mouse \n\nneuroblastoma (N2a) cells stably transfected with cDNAs encoding human APP695 (N2a695) \n\nwere kindly provided by Professor Wenjie Luo (Weill Cornell Medical College). The rat brain \n\nmicrovascular endothelial cell line (RBE4) was provided as a gift by the laboratory of Dr. M. \n\nAschner (Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt Kennedy Center, Nashville, Tennessee). \n\n2.2. Methods \n\n2.2.1. Synthesis and characterization of PEI and CS polyplexes conjugated with SA and Lf \n\nThe conjugation of PEI or CS to SA and Lf (designated as CS-SA-Lf and PEI-SA-Lf) was \n\nperformed as previously reported by Xie and co-workers [38], with minor modifications. In \n\nbrief, first, SA (2.5 mg) and EDC (25 mg, at a ratio 1:10) were dissolved in 1.0 mL anhydrous \n\nDMSO and stirred at 60\u00baC for 1 hour, until EDC and SA were well-dissolved and mixed. The \n\nresulting mixture (SA:EDC) was then added slowly to 1% (w/v) of CS-LMW and PEI-HMW in \n\nsodium acetate buffer (0.1 M sodium acetate/0.1 M acetic acid, pH 4.5) and the reaction \n\nsolution was kept at room temperature in the dark during 24 hours, with stirring in a water \n\nbath. The amine group on PEI or CS was crosslinked with the carboxylic group of stearic acid \n\nby EDC as linker. Posteriorly, the resulting conjugate, CS/PEI-SA, was dialyzed first against \n\nphosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 day and then against double deionized water for \n\n2 days, using dialysis membrane (SnakeSkinTM Dialysis Tubing, MWCO 3500 Da, 22mm dry \n\ndiameter, ThermoScientific). The conjugated CS/PEI-SA was isolated as a \u201csponge\u201d by \n\nlyophilization, and was further characterized by 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) \n\nspectroscopy. All proton NMR spectra were recorded in solution of studied compounds in D2O \n\nusing a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz equipped with a QCI cryoprobe. For the preparation of \n\nCS/PEI-SA-Lf, Lf (10 mg) was dissolved in 1.0 mL aqueous solution of water and mixed with \n\n0.5 mL aqueous solution of 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride (2-IOT, 0.7 mg) and the reaction \n\nproceed for 1 hour at room temperature, with moderate shaking. The excess of 2-IOT was \n\nremoved through a column of Sephadex G 100 column (Hitrap desalting column) using PBS 1x \n\n(pH 7.0) as elution buffer. Fractions were collected according to the chromatogram obtained \n\n\n\n \n\n 236 \n\nby analysis of the absorbance (a peak contains about 90% of thiolated Lf) [45]. Subsequently, \n\nCS-SA or PEI-SA were dissolved in 0.5 mL PBS (pH 7.0) and then added to the PBS solution of \n\nLf, drop by drop, for 20 hours at room temperature, in the dark. To remove unreacted Lf, the \n\nresulting mixtures were purified by dialysis (SnakeSkinTM Dialysis Tubing, MWCO 3500 Da, \n\n22mm dry diameter, ThermoScientific) during 4 days against double deionized water and \n\nfreeze dried, for further usage. The SDS-PAGE was used to characterize the carriers CS-SA-Lf \n\nand PEI-SA-Lf.  \n\n2.2.2. Formulation and characterization of CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b, PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b, \n\nCS-SA/pre-miR-29b and PEI-SA/pre-miR-29b complexes \n\nFor all experiments, the human pre-miR-29b was obtained from a bacterial cell culture of \n\nRhodovulum sulfidophilum DSM 1374 strain (BCCM/LMG, Belgium) modified with the plasmid \n\npBHSR1-RM containing the sequence of pre-miR-29b. The growth was performed in a semi-\n\ndefined medium containing 30 \u00b5g/mL Kanamycin. After biosynthesis, the recombinant pre-\n\nmiR-29b was recovered from a complex mixture of small RNAs, through affinity \n\nchromatography by using a column of arginine, as previously described by Pereira and \n\ncollaborators [46]. The quantity and quality of the purified pre-miR-29b was assessed by \n\nmeasuring its optical density at 260 nm and 280 nm and by polyacrylamide electrophoresis, \n\nrespectively. Recombinant pre-miR-29b was covalently labeled with the fluorescent dye, \n\nFITC, when necessary. PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b, PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b, CS-Lf/pre-miR-29b and \n\nPEI-Lf/pre-miR-29b systems were formulated using the method of simple complexation \n\nthrough electrostatic interaction by using different amines to phosphate ratios (N/P ratios, \n\nmolar ratio of CS/PEI-nitrogen atoms present in the protonated amine groups to pre-miR-29b-\n\nphosphate groups), as described by Pereira and co-workers [47]. Pre-miR-29b stock solution \n\nwas prepared by pre-miRNA dissolution in sodium acetate buffer, up to a final concentration \n\nof 2 \u00b5g/mL and was kept constant in all the methods used for the characterization of the \n\nformed complexes [47]. The CS-SA-Lf, PEI-SA-Lf, PEI-Lf and CS-Lf stock solutions were also \n\nprepared in sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5 in a concentration of 10 mg/mL. Briefly, the \n\ncomplexes were obtained by addition of 100 \u00b5L of CS-SA-Lf, PEI-SA-Lf, PEI-Lf or CS-Lf \n\nsolution, of variable concentration, dropwise to the pre-miR-29b solution (400 \u00b5L). The \n\ncomplexes were immediately mixed using a vortex mixer at maximum speed for 1 min. After \n\n30 min of stabilization at room temperature, the complexes were recovered by centrifugation \n\n(15000 g, 20 min). The complexation of pre-miR-29b by CS-SA, PEI-SA, CS-SA-Lf and PEI-SA-Lf \n\nwas evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis [47]. \n\n2.2.3. Determination of the encapsulation efficiency \n\nThe encapsulation efficiency (EE) was calculated by determining free pre-miRNA \n\nconcentration in the supernatant recovered after particle centrifugation (15000g, 20 min, \n\n25\u00baC). The amount of unbound pre-miR-29b was quantified by UV spectrophotometry \n\n(Nanophotometer), at 260 nm. Supernatant recovered from unloaded complexes (without pre-\n\nmiRNA) was used as a blank. Three repetitions of this procedure were performed for each \n\n\n\n \n\n 237 \n\nsystem. EE was determined using the following formula: EE % = [(Total pre-miRNA amount \u2013 \n\npre-miRNA supernatant amount)/Total pre-miRNA amount] x 100 [47]. \n\n2.2.4. Cell culture  \n\nIn this study, N2a695, RBE4 and Z310 choroidal epithelial cells were used. N2a695 cells (at \n\npassages 13-30) were cultured in the following medium: 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco\u2019s Modified \n\nEagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) and OptiMEM supplemented with 5% (wt/vol) heat-inactivated fetal \n\nbovine serum (FBS) and 1% (wt/vol) penicillin-streptomycin. In these cells there is a \n\nconstitutive endogenous human BACE1 expression, enabling greater sensitivity for detecting \n\npre-miR-29b induced changes in the human BACE1 expression at post transcriptional level. \n\nZ310 cell line (at passages 95-100) was maintained in DMEM high glucose growth medium \n\ncontaining 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin [48]. On the other hand, RBE4 cultures (at \n\npassages 7-30) were grown in the following medium: Minimum Essential Medium (?MEM) and \n\nHam\u2019s F10 Nutrient Mix (1:1 vol/vol) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, \n\n1% L-glutamine and 0.6% Geneticin (300 ?g/m). All cell lines were kept at 37\u00baC in a \n\nhumidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells were subcultured regularly using trypsin-\n\nEDTA [49]. \n\n2.2.5. In vitro transfection and expression \n\n2.2.5.1. In vitro cellular uptake \u2013 Cell live imaging \n\nIn order to investigate the cellular uptake, pre-miR-29b was labeled with FITC. In brief, an \n\naliquot of FITC-DMSO solution was added in drops to pre-miR-29b solution (8.72 nM). The \n\nresultant solution was kept under stirring for 3 hours at room temperature. Then, the final \n\nproduct was incubated with 3 M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol ice-cold at -20\u00baC \n\nduring 30 min. Excess FITC was removed by centrifugation at 12000g for 30 min at 4\u00baC. After \n\ncentrifuging, the pellet was washed with 75% ethanol twice, followed by a 5 min \n\ncentrifugation at 12000 g (4\u00baC). Finally, the FITC-pre-miR-29b was ressuspended in OptiMEM \n\nand encapsulated with CS-SA-Lf, PEI-SA-Lf, PEI-Lf and CS-Lf. N2a695 cells were seeded at a \n\ndensity of 2\u00d7104 cells/cm2 in ?-Slide 8-well flat bottom imaging plates (Ibidi GmbH, \n\nGermany). In the following day, the medium was replaced by fresh serum-free medium and \n\ncells were stained with Hoechst 33342\u00ae nuclear probe for 20 min. Subsequently, the cells \n\nwere transfected with the complexes prepared with FITC-labeled pre-miR-29b in serum-free \n\nmedium. The cells were transferred to a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope \n\n(CLSM; Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., US) equipped with a plane-apocromat 63\u00d7/DIC objective and \n\nprocessed in Zeiss Zen (SP2, 2010) and Imaris software (Bitplane, Switzerland), in order to \n\nevaluate the cellular uptake. The fluorescence images were obtained at 63\u00d7 amplification. \n\nCells without the addition of complexes were imaged as control. \n\n2.2.5.2. In vitro transfection studies  \n\nBriefly, N2a695 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2\u00d7104 cells/well in 1.5 mL \n\nof complete medium. When a 50% to 60% confluence was achieved, the media was removed \n\n\n\n \n\n 238 \n\nand then replaced with serum-free culture medium. After 12 hours, pre-miR-29-loaded \n\ncomplexes and Lipofectamine/pre-miR-29b (Lipo/pre-miR-29b), previously prepared with a \n\npre-miR-29b concentration of 8.72 nM, were added to the wells and incubated with the cells, \n\nfor 4 hours. The culture medium was then replaced with 1.5 mL of fresh medium \n\nsupplemented with 1% FBS and 1% antibiotic, to allow the cells to remain metabolically \n\nactive, expressing human BACE1. The cells were incubated for an additional 72 hours at 37\u00baC. \n\nAs a negative control, untreated cells were used and as a positive control, transfection with \n\nLipo/pre-miR-29b was performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All transfection \n\nexperiments were performed in triplicate. Total RNA was recovered with TRIzol reagent \n\n(Invitrogen) and chloroform, further purified by isopropanol precipitation and washed with \n\n75% ethanol. The concentration of total RNA was determined using a NanoPhotometer UV/Vis \n\nSpectrophotometer, and the integrity and quality of RNA was assessed by agarose gel \n\nelectrophoresis. RNA was treated with DNase I to avoid genomic contamination. First-strand \n\ncDNA was synthesized using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher \n\nScientific Inc.) in a total volume of 20 \u00b5L containing 1 \u00b5g of total RNA, according to the \n\nmanufacturer\u2019s instructions. \n\n2.2.5.3. Expression of BACE1 mRNA in N2a695 cells by RT-qPCR  \n\nFor quantitative analysis, RT-qPCR amplification of cDNA was performed using the Maxima\u00ae \n\nSYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) in an IQ5 Cycler from \n\nBioRad. PCR reaction was prepared in a final volume of 20 ?L containing 10 ?L of Maxima\u00ae \n\nSYBR Green/Fluorescein qPCR Master Mix, 1.2 ?L each of 25 \u00b5M forward and reverse primers \n\nand 1 ?L of cDNA. The cycle was performed as follows: 5 min at 95\u00baC, followed by 40 cycles of \n\n30 s at 95\u00baC, 30 s at 62\u00baC, and 30 s at 72\u00baC. RT-qPCR efficiencies were calculated from the \n\ngiven slopes with MyIQ 2.0 software (BioRad). The relative quantification of the BACE1 \n\nexpression was based on the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method in which the amount of \n\nthe target was determined to be 2-(?CT target - ?CT calibrator), normalized to levels of \n\nglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and relative to the untreated control \n\ncells. The primers used in these experiments were 5\u2019-AGACGCTCAACATCCTGGTG-3\u2019 (forward) \n\nand 5\u2019-CCTGGGTGTAGGGCACATAC-3\u2019 (reverse) for the amplification of human BACE (hBACE) \n\nand 5\u2019- TGACGTGCCGCCTGGAGAAA-3\u2019 (forward), 5\u2019-AGTGTAGCCCAAGATGCCCTTCAG-3\u2019 \n\n(reverse) for the amplification of GAPDH. Each sample was run in triplicate, and CT values \n\nwere averaged from the triplicate. The final data were averaged from 3 separately conducted \n\nexperiments. \n\n2.2.6 Transport across in vitro BBB model  \n\n2.2.6.1. In vitro BBB model \n\nRBE4 cells and Z310 cells were established to evaluate the ability of the dual targeting \n\ncomplexes transpose the BBB model. RBE4 and Z310 cells were seeded in 12-well culture \n\ninsert coated with type I collagen (Polycarbonate Membrane Transwell Inserts of 1.0 mm \n\nmean pore size, 1.12 cm2 surface area, Corning, NY, USA). 0.5 mL of cell suspensions \n\n\n\n \n\n 239 \n\ncontaining 2.0 x 105 cells was added to the inner (donor) chamber, which was inserted into \n\nthe outer (acceptor) chamber containing 1.3 mL of the same culture medium. A cell \n\nmonolayer is usually formed 3-5 days after seeding, as judged by three criteria: (1) the cells \n\nformed a confluent monolayer without visible spaces between cells under a light microscope; \n\n(2) the height of the culture medium in the inner chamber had to be at least 2 mm higher \n\nthan that in the outer chamber for at least 24 hours; and (3) a constant transendothelial \n\nelectrical resistance (TEER) value across the cell layer was obtained [50]. The TEER was used \n\nto measure the formation of tight junctions, indicating the integrity of BBB structure for \n\nstudying drug delivery to the brain. The cell monolayer integrity was monitored using an \n\nEVOM Endohmchamber (Word Precision Instruments, Inc. Sarasota, Florida, USA) to measure \n\nthe TEER value of the in vitro BBB model. Only cell monolayers with TEER value above 100 \n\n?cm2 were selected for the transport studies, which indicate that this system could be used \n\nas an in vitro BBB model [50]. All the permeability experiments were performed in serum-free \n\nmedium at 37\u00baC, and the drug carriers, including CS-SA/pre-miR-29b-FITC, CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-\n\n29b-FITC, PEI-SA/pre-miR-29b-FITC and PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b-FITC were added into the \n\ndonor compartment of the above BBB model with the pre-miR-29b concentration of 8.72 nM. \n\nAfter 4 hours, the inserts were removed. The concentration of pre-miR-29b transported across \n\nBBB media was determined using a spectrofluorometer (Spectramax Gemini XS, Molecular \n\nDevices LLC, US), with the excitation wavelength of 480 nm and the emission wavelength at \n\n590 nm. The BBB transport ratio of pre-miR-29b was calculated as follows: Transport ratio % = \n\n[(Total Fluorescence in the outer chamber)/ [(Total Fluorescence in the inner chamber + \n\nTotal Fluorescence in the outer chamber)] x 100.  \n\n2.2.7.2. Immunofluorescence  \n\nEndothelial cells from the in vitro BBB model were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with \n\n4% of paraformaldehyde (PFA) buffer solution. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS for 10 \n\nmin, followed by permeabilization with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. After \n\nfixation, the nucleus of the endothelial cells was counterstained with Hoechst 33342\u00ae \n\n(1:1000) for 10 minutes followed by 3 washing steps with PBS-T. Cells were mounted on slides \n\nand the fluorescence images were acquired using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss \n\nLSM 710, Carl Zeiss SMT Inc., USA) equipped with a plane-apocromat 63\u00d7/DIC objective. \n\nImages were processed and analyzed using ImageJ software. All experiments were repeated \n\nat least three times, and representative images are shown. \n\n \n\n2.8. Statistical analysis  \n\nAll the experiments were repeated at least three times using independent culture \n\npreparations. Data are presented as the mean \u00b1 standard error. Statistical comparisons were \n\nperformed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by pair-wise comparisons \n\nusing the Fisher\u2019s least significant difference test. A P value&lt;0.05 was considered statistically \n\nsignificant. Statistical analysis was performed by using GraphPad Prism 6 software. \n\n\n\n \n\n 240 \n\n3. Results  \n\n3.1. Synthesis and characterization of CS-SA, PEI-SA, CS-SA-Lf, PEI-SA-Lf \n\ncomplexes \n\nThe carriers of CS/PEI-SA were synthesized by chemical reaction between the carboxyl group \n\nof SA and the amino group of CS or PEI in the presence of EDC, a carboxyl activating agent \n\n[38]. 1H NMR experiments were used to characterize and confirm the chemical structure of \n\nthe obtained CS/PEI-SA complexes. Also, for comparing the signals, CS and PEI spectra were \n\nalso recorded without stearic acid. The 1H-NMR assignment of CS was previously determined \n\nand is as follows: 1H NMR (CS, D2O) ? =5.10 (H1), ? =3.09 (H2), ? =3.43~3.81 (H3, H4, H5, H6), ? \n\n=1.96 (NHCOCH3) ppm. The signal of H1 was effected by the near water peak suppression of \n\nH2O at ?=4.76. Comparing with CS \n1H-NMR spectrum, the triplet signals at 0.9 ppm, due to the \n\nterminal CH3 protons of stearic acid and the new signal between 1\u20131.5 ppm corresponding to \n\nthe CH2 chain of acyl chain, showed that stearic acid was linked to CS. Similarly, the \n1H NMR \n\nspectrum of the PEI was first assignment and the proton peaks of PEI (\u2013NHCH2CH2\u2013) appeared \n\nat 3.2\u20132.0 ppm. The molecular structure of PEI-SA was then confirmed by 1H NMR. 1H NMR \n\nanalysis indicates that the amino-groups of the PEI were acylated. The 1H-NMR assignment of \n\nPEI-SA was as follows: ? (ppm): 0.86\u20130.89 (t, -CH2CH2(CH2)15CH3), 1.25 (br, -\n\nCH2CH2(CH2)15CH3), 1.62 (br, -CH2CH2(CH2)9CH3), 2.18 (br, -CH2CH2(CH2)9CH3), 2.39\u20133.3 (m, -\n\nCH2CH2NH-, -CH2CH2N-, -CH2CH2NHCO-, -CH2CH2NHCO-). Although, the same chemical shifts \n\nappeared in PEI-SA, however the sharp peaks at 3.0-2.4 ppm could contribute to the chemical \n\nshifts of PEI. Moreover, the ratio of peak area at 3.0\u20132.4 ppm to the peak area of methyl \n\ngroup in PEI-SA was bigger than that of PEI. These results indicated that stearic acid was \n\nsuccessfully link to PEI. The NMR studies also demonstrated that very few free amines are \n\navailable on the CS-SA complexes comparing with PEI-SA complexes. The functionalization \n\nwith Lf was obtained using a common method with 2-iminothiolane hydrochloride as the \n\nsulfhydrylization reagent [45]. After purification, thiolated protein was obtained. The SDS-\n\nPAGE was used to further confirm the surface capping of the terminal amines of the CS/PEI-\n\nSA with Lf. In the SDS-PAGE a new band above 100 KDa was observed, indicating that Lf ligand \n\nwas covalently attached to the CS/PEI-SA (Figure 1). NMR experiments are current running to \n\ncomplement the SDS-PAGE results. \n\n \n \n \n\n\n\n \n\n 241 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 1 - SDS-PAGE of CS-SA, CS-SA-Lf, PEI-SA and PEI-SA-Lf. \n\n \n\n3.2. Preparation of CS-SA-pre-miR-29b, PEI-SA-pre-miR-29b, CS-SA-Lf-pre-miR-\n\n29b and PEI-SA-Lf-pre-miR-29b \n\nAll pre-miR-29b-loaded complexes were prepared by electrostatic interactions that occur \n\nbetween the positively charged amine groups of the carriers and the phosphate groups of the \n\npre-miR-29b [47]. The complexes were mixed with pre-miR-29b for the formation of pre-miR-\n\n29b-loaded complexes in acetate buffer at pH 4.5. In order to determine the degree of \n\ncompaction between pre-miR-29b and all carriers in study, a gel retardation assay and UV \n\nspectrometry were performed (Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 2A, the mobility of pre-miR-29b was \n\nfully retarded by all carriers, indicating that the pre-miR-29b was tightly neutralized within \n\nthe carriers. It was also possible to observe that PEI-SA-pre-miR-29b and PEI-SA-Lf-pre-miR-\n\n29b moved in direction of the anode, that is, some polyplexes present an excess of positive \n\ncharge, know as overcharging effects. These results are in accordance with what was \n\nobserved in the encapsulation studies, in which 100% of encapsulation efficiency was \n\nachieved, indicating that pre-miR-29b was completely complexed with PEI-SA-Lf (Fig. 2B). In \n\nwhat concerns to the CS-based systems, CS-SA-Lf seems to be more efficient in pre-miR-29b \n\ncondensation, once a value of 86% was obtained in comparison with 80% for CS-SA.  \n\n\n\n \n\n 242 \n\n \n \n\nFigure 2 - Synthesis of pre-miR-29b-loaded complexes.

(B) Encapsulation efficiency of different pre-miR-29b-\n\nloaded complexes (Data represent the mean\u00b1SD, n = 4). \n\n \n\n3.3. In vitro cellular uptake and intracellular trafficking of the pre-miR-29b-\n\nloaded complexes \n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of cellular uptake of pre-miR-29b loaded onto the CS-SA-Lf and PEI-\n\nSA-Lf, laser scanning confocal microscopy was employed to quantify the uptake and to \n\nvisualize the cellular distribution of pre-miR-29b (see Fig. 3 and 4). To accomplish this \n\npurpose, the pre-miR-29b was labeled with FITC to construct fluorescent complexes for their \n\nlocalization in N2a695 cells. Figures 3 and 4 present the confocal fluorescence \n\nmicrophotographs of N2a695 cells treated with CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b-FITC and PEI-SA-Lf/pre-\n\nmiR-29b-FITC followed during 2.5 hours, respectively. As demonstrated by serial Z-stacks of \n\nconfocal images, pre-miR-29b-loaded complexes were clearly detected within the cells (see \n\nFig. 3 and 4). After 1 hour of transfection, a homogeneous distribution of CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-\n\n29b-FITC and PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b-FITC complexes within the cells was observed. Indeed, a \n\nsignificant fraction appeared in the cytoplasm near the cell nucleus (see Fig. 3 and 4), \n\nsuggesting that the complexes displayed an excellent ability to cross cell membranes by \n\ncellular endocytosis. As shown in Fig. 3 and 4, after 2 hours of incubation, pre-miR-29b-\n\nloaded complexes were also present in the nuclei of cells, being visible the green \n\nfluorescence throughout the entire cytoplasm and nucleus. Following the confirmation that \n\nthe pre-miR29b-loaded complexes were efficiently delivered into N2a695 cells, the expression \n\nof pre-miR-29b-FITC was also evaluated by quantitative analysis of cellular accumulation of \n\nFITC.  \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n 243 \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3 - Confocal laser scanning microscopy images showing the intracellular uptake of \n\nFITC-labelled CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b in N2a695 cells during 0.5 to 2.5 hours.

The results obtained with quantitative \n\n(A) \n\n\n\n \n\n 244 \n\nanalysis were extremely similar to those obtained with fluorescence imaging. Interestingly, no \n\nsignificant differences were found in the mean fluorescence intensity at 1.5 or 2.5 hours, \n\nindicating that a plateau was achieved after 1.5 hours of incubation, in the cells transfected \n\nwith CS-SA-Lf (data not shown).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - Confocal laser scanning microscopy images showing the intracellular uptake of \n\nFITC-labelled PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b in N2a695 cells during 0.5 to 2.5 hours.

These results indicate that the release of pre-miR-29b from the CS-SA-Lf complexes \n\nwas faster than that from the PEI-SA-Lf. \n\n3.4. Evaluation of human BACE1 gene knockdown induced by pre-miR-29b-loaded \n\ncomplexes \n\nTo investigate the effect of recombinant pre-miR-29b on hBACE1 mRNA expression levels, RT-\n\nqPCR measurements were performed. To accomplish this purpose, N2a695 cells were \n\ntransfected with CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b, PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b and Lipo/pre-miR-29b with \n\n8.72 nM of the target miRNA. After 72 hours of transfection, it was verified that the \n\noverexpression of recombinant pre-miR-29b induces a notably decrease in the endogenous \n\nhBACE1 mRNA levels, in comparison with the untreated cells (Fig. 5). In particular, hBACE1 \n\nmRNA expression was decreased by approximately 77% in cells transfected with CS-SA-Lf/pre-\n\nmiR-29b, and by 69% in those transfected with PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b complexes, when \n\ncompared with untreated cells (Fig. 5). This reduction on mRNA hBACE1 expression was also \n\nsignificantly higher than the silencing (around 40%) achieved in cells transfected with \n\nLipo/pre-miR-29b, the positive control (Fig. 5). Thus, in comparison to Lipofectamine 2000, \n\nCS-SA-Lf demonstrated a higher efficacy in delivering pre-miR-29b once it was achieved a 2 \n\nfold reduction of BACE1 mRNA levels.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - In vitro gene silencing effect of recombinant pre-miR-29b on hBACE1 mRNA levels \n\nin N2a695 cells following 72 hours treatment with CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b, PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-\n\n29b and Lipo/pre-miR-29b. Values in the graph are mean from triplicates of RT-qPCR \n\nthreshold cycles for hBACE1 mRNA normalized to those of mRNA for GAPDH from 3 \n\nindependent experiments and demonstrate significant differences across treatment \n\nconditions. ANOVA, mean\u00b1SD. \n\n\n\n \n\n 246 \n\nAlthough the functionalized CS presents a slightly lower encapsulation efficiency (86%) \n\ncompared with the unmodified CS (90%), it shows a higher transfection efficiency, and \n\nconsequently leads to higher hBACE inhibition, very similar to those obtained for the \n\nunmodified CS (77% to CS-SA-Lf and 76.4% to CS). These results show that the \n\nfunctionalization did not affect the delivery of recombinant pre-miR-29b to the cells and its \n\nbiological activity continues to exceed the synthetic miR-29b. Furthermore, the PEI \n\nfunctionalized demonstrates a decrease in the inhibition of hBACE1 (69%) compared to the \n\nunmodified PEI (78%) what may be due to their structural characteristics after \n\nfunctionalization. \n\n3.5. Permeability across the BBB using CS-SA/pre-miR-29b, PEI-SA/pre-miR-29b, \n\nCS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b and PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b  \n\nIn order to evaluate the ability of all the systems to cross the BBB, in vitro BBB model was \n\nestablished using RBE4 cells [49], which were transfected with CS-SA/pre-miR-29b-FITC, CS-\n\nSA-Lf/pre-miR-29b-FITC, PEI-SA/pre-miR-29b-FITC and PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b-FITC. The \n\nfluorescence intensity in the inner and outer chambers of the transwell was determined, in \n\norder to evaluate the targeting effect of Lf and SA in the CS and PEI polymers to cross the \n\nBBB. Fig. 6A shows the transport ability of different complexes to cross BBB model at the \n\nsame concentration of pre-miR-29b. After 4 hours of incubation, the transport ratios were of \n\nabout 12.28, 41.61, 64.56 and 64.93% for PEI-SA, PEI-SA-Lf, CS-SA and CS-SA-Lf, respectively. \n\nThese results indicated that the dual-targeting complexes have enhanced transport ability to \n\ncross the BBB compared to the complexes with only one targeting group. Fig. 6A shows also \n\nthe immunostaining microphotographs of CS-SA-Lf and PEI-SA-Lf internalized in RBE4 cells. As \n\nrevealed in Fig. 6A, the strong green intensity in cytoplasm of RBE4 cells suggested that \n\ncomplexes were internalized by endocytosis through the cells. Z310 cells were used as in \n\nvitro blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier model for evaluating the dual-targeting effects (Fig. \n\n6B).  \n\n\n\n \n\n 247 \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - The transport ratio of pre-miR-29b across the BBB during 4 hours in RBE4 cells (A) \n\nand Z310 cells (B). Data were presented as the mean \u00b1 standard deviation. (A) Intracellular \n\ntrafficking in RBE4 cells after treating with CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b-FITC and PEI-SA-LF/pre-\n\nmiR-29b-FITC. The fluorescence signals were collected by LSCM with three channels: blue \n\nfluorescence from nuclei stained with Hoechst 33258, green fluorescence from FITC labeled \n\npre-miR-29b and the merged images of three channels.  \n\n \n\nWith the same incubation time and pre-miR-29b concentration, the different formulations \n\nwere internalized by Z310 cells in the following order: CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b > PEI-SA-Lf/pre-\n\nmiR-29b, with transport ratios of 65.49% and 48.08%, respectively. These results are in \n\nagreement with the BBB transportation result. These findings demonstrated that the dual \n\ntargeting complexes (PEI/CS-SA-Lf) could mediate the recognition via Lf receptors and fatty \n\nacid transporter(s)/low-density lipoprotein receptor expressed by RBE4 and Z310 cells, \n\nallowing the transport of exogenous pre-miR-29b into the brain, probably via the pathway of \n\nreceptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). In addition, Lf is a competent protein that intensifies \n\nthe interaction between complexes and RBE4 and Z310 cells. On the other hand, these results \n\ncan also be explained due to the positive charge of the cationic polymers, which could \n\npromote electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged RBE4 and Z310 cell \n\nmembranes, activating the cellular uptake through the pathway of adsorptive-mediated \n\ntranscytosis (AMT) [38]. The internalization of CS-SA and CS-SA-Lf by RBE4 cells was higher \n\nthan that of PEI-SA and PEI-SA-Lf. Thus, it was found that the chitosan improved the delivery \n\n\n\n \n\n 248 \n\nefficacy both in terms of targeting at an earlier time point as well as in the accumulation in \n\ncells. These results can be related to some characteristics of CS that can transiently open \n\ntight junctions, enabling the transport of components via a paracellular pathway through the \n\nepithelial barrier. \n\n \n\nConclusion \n\nIn conclusion, the present in vitro study demonstrated that CS-SA-Lf and PEI-SA-Lf could \n\nefficiently cross the BBB and thus, deliver the recombinant pre-miR-29b as a therapeutic \n\nagent to the neuronal cells. The pre-miR-29b induced the inhibition of BACE1 mRNA. \n\nSpecifically, the in vitro cellular uptake study showed that lactoferrin and stearic acid \n\nconjugated with chitosan are highly efficient in cell transfection (about 65%) and pre-miRNA \n\nintracellular delivery, and consequently, in the silencing of the BACE1 mRNA in comparison to \n\nPEI-SA-Lf. These results suggest that chitosan conjugated with stearic acid and lactoferrin can \n\nrepresent a potentially promising and interesting therapeutic strategy for targeting \n\nrecombinant pre-miR-29b to neuronal cells, aiming the development of effective strategies to \n\ntreat AD. \n\n \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThis work was supported by the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), \n\nthrough the project EXPL/BBB-BIO/1056/2012 and Pest-OE/SAU/UI0709/2014.

Most miRNAs employed in the development of these therapeutic approaches are \n\nproduced either by enzymatic or chemical synthesis methods. Although, the synthesis process \n\nis efficient for large scale production, several limitations have been found regarding the use \n\nof synthetic miRNAs, once the isolation of these formulations are based on methods that \n\nemploy chemical solvents and denaturing agents. Consequently, the final product is not \n\nsuitable to be biologically applied, because of the health risks associated, and thus strongly \n\ncompromise the success of several RNA based-procedures in the clinical field. Aiming to \n\novercome some of these limitations, this project was centered on the establishment of a new \n\nstrategy to biosynthesize and to purify the recombinant pre-miR-29b, also focusing on the \n\npreparation of suitable non-viral systems to efficiently deliver the pre-miR-29b to the cell. In \n\naddition, it was demonstrated the efficiency of the recombinant pre-miR-29b in BACE1 \n\nknockdown, using in vitro neuronal cells lines. \n\nThe recombinant production of pre-miR-29b was performed using the bacterium R. \n\nsulfidophilum DSM 1374, harboring a plasmid encoding for human pre-mir-29b. Regarding the \n\ngrowth conditions, and conversely to what was previously described for this bacterium, it was \n\npossible to develop an original approach for the aerobic growth of R. sulfidophilum, which \n\nresulted in a cellular growth improvement (higher growth rates, higher optical densities and a \n\nshorter cultivation time) followed by an enhanced production of intracellular (about 358 \n\n?g/L) and extracellular (approximately 182 \u00b5g/L) pre-miR-29b. In addition, the results \n\nindicated that the extracellular medium is not highly contaminated with genomic DNA, \n\nproteins or endotoxins, which is an important parameter concerning the integrity, stability \n\nand activity of the pre-miRNA (Paper III). In general, the use of this alternative strategy, \n\nbased on the secretion of the pre-miRNA, avoids time-consuming and laborious RNA extraction \n\nmethods that frequently induce RNA denaturation and, simultaneously suppresses the use of \n\norganic solvents and extremely toxic chemicals which are biologically hazardous. Despite this \n\ngreat advantage, in the course of this thesis it was difficult to recover the pre-miRNA from \n\nthe extracellular medium, due to the high dilution factor, and the purification experiments \n\nwere developed by using the RNAs recovered from the cells. \n\nConsidering the previous knowledge that pre-miR-29b can be successfully obtained by a \n\nsimple, fast and economic process using the R. sulfidophilum host, it is required the \n\ndevelopment and implementation of an adequate and efficient purification method that \n\nallows to overcome the challenges of the already existing chromatographic techniques, for \n\nthe purification of miRNAs. In this project, it is suggested that amino acid-based affinity \n\nchromatography can be considered as a promising chromatographic strategy, to specifically \n\n\n\n \n\n 256 \n\nand efficiently purify the pre-miR-29b, eliminating the host impurities (small RNAs, proteins \n\nand endotoxins) by exploiting the specific interactions occurring between the L-lysine and L-\n\narginine ligands and the pre-miRNA. Thus, it was developed an initial study to characterize \n\nthe binding of pre-miR-29b onto the amino acids-based agarose supports using Surface \n\nPlasmon Resonance (Paper IV). The understanding of the conditions favoring these \n\ninteractions was essential to control, manipulate, determine and establish the selective \n\nbinding/elution chromatographic conditions (such as the composition and ionic strength of \n\nelution buffer and temperature), in order to improve the binding specificity of the pre-miR-\n\n29b onto the amino acids-based supports, preserving their structural stability and integrity. \n\nConsidering the equilibrium dissociation constant, it was verified that the recombinant pre-\n\nmiR-29b binds more strongly to L-arginine (KD between 10\n-6 and 10-7 M) than to L-lysine (KD \n\nbetween 10-5 and 10-7 M). This study also disclosed that the structure of the pre-miR-29b is \n\nsensitive to changes in the physical and chemical environmental conditions. In general, the \n\nresults obtained provide valuable information for the optimization and implementation of L-\n\nlysine and L-arginine amino acids as chromatographic ligands, in order to improve the \n\nefficiency of pre-miR-29b purification.  \n\nLysine-agarose matrix was the first support to be tested for the purification of pre-miR-29b. \n\nDue the presence of the amine groups in its structure, it is suggested that the main \n\ninteractions established between nucleic acids and the L-lysine amino acid are electrostatic. \n\nThus, initial experiments were performed to choose the best binding/elution conditions for \n\npre-miR-29b, using sodium chloride gradients. However, under these conditions the RNA \n\nbinding was not effective and the selective purification of pre-miRNA was not achieved. \n\nTherefore, the retention behavior of pre-miR-29b was evaluated using an ammonium sulfate \n\nstepwise gradient (Paper V), in order to achieve higher specificity. Despite the effectiveness \n\nof lysine-based methodology in the purification of pre-miR-29b, the requirement for high salt \n\nconcentration can be seen as a disadvantage, especially with regard to biotechnological and \n\nclinical applications.  \n\nTo overcome this limitation and to improve pre-miR-29b purification, the arginine-agarose \n\nmatrix was used. The application of arginine as specific ligand allowed the pre-miR-29b \n\nrecovery under mild salt conditions, using sodium chloride gradients, showing that this matrix \n\ncan be a good alternative to purify pre-miR-29b (Paper VI). The arginine ligand allowed the \n\npurification of the pre-miR-29b using three different elution strategies, namely by using \n\nsodium chloride (90% of purity and 97% of yield using a low salt concentration) and ammonium \n\nsulfate (33% of purity and requires high salt concentrations) gradients, or by establishing a \n\ncompetitive elution strategy with arginine (98% of purity and 57% of yield). Although \n\nelectrostatic interactions are most prevalent in the arginine matrix, it was verified the \n\npresence of other interactions due the binding and elution conditions used. Moreover, the \n\nquality control analysis revealed high integrity of pre-miR-29b preparations as well as high \n\npurity degree and recovery yields, eliminating R. sulfidophilum impurities (proteins and \n\n\n\n \n\n 257 \n\nendotoxins) as well as other species of small RNAs, which can origin adverse effects and \n\ninflammatory response to the patients.  \n\nTaking into account that the structure of the chromatographic supports is continuously \n\noptimized to afford rapid and efficient separations, it was also tested a monolithic support to \n\npurify the pre-miR-29b, in order to overcome the limitations associated with the conventional \n\nsupports in the purification of miRNAs. The application of the agmatine monolithic support for \n\npre-miR-29b purification revealed a specific recognition of the pre-miR-29b that was totally \n\nisolated from other small RNAs, which represented an advantage to obtain highly pure RNA in \n\na short time (Paper VII). These results were useful for the implementation of a new affinity \n\nchromatographic strategy using monoliths immobilized with specific ligands, such as \n\nagmatine, to efficiently and selectively purify the pre-miR-29b. In addition, this strategy \n\nallowed an efficient pre-miR-29b separation without flow rate dependence using similar \n\nbinding and elution strategies to those used with arginine-agarose. With this study it was \n\nverified that the dynamic binding capacity for RNA molecules is dependent of the feed \n\nconcentration and the characterization of the modified monolith revealed that a maximum \n\nbinding capacity of 8.08 mg/mL was reached to a RNA concentration of 0.25 mg/mL. \n\nMoreover, the dissociation constant value obtained was 2.6x10?7 M, revealing a good affinity \n\ninteraction between the agmatine ligand and pre-miR-29b. The quality control analysis in the \n\nfinal pre-miR-29b sample revealed that the removal of host impurities (proteins and small \n\nRNAs) was efficient. In fact, this new monolithic support arises as a powerful instrument on \n\nthe miRNA purification to be used in further clinical applications, providing a more rapid and \n\neconomical purification platform, resulting in a short contact time with pre-miR-29b \n\nmolecules, which preserves the structural stability and integrity of target molecules.  \n\nThus, the results and conclusions obtained in these studies suggest that the mechanism \n\ninherent to the purification of the pre-miR-29b results from the occurrence of multiple non-\n\ncovalent interactions, including electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals \n\nforces and cation\u2013? interactions, which combined induce a specific biorecognition of the pre-\n\nmiR-29b by arginine, lysine and agmatine amino acids. In general, the application of amino \n\nacids-based affinity chromatography allowed the selective, efficient and specific isolation of \n\nthe target pre-miRNA from the complex biological mixture of other sRNAs with high recovery \n\nyield, integrity and good purity, demonstrating thus the potential and versatility of these \n\nligands in the purification of pre-miR-29b, in a single unit operation. Furthermore, the \n\npurification of the pre-miR-29b using the amino acids-based affinity chromatography showed \n\nseveral improvements over the currently used purification methods, thus proving to be an \n\ninteresting option for the downstream processing of miRNA therapeutic products.  \n\nAfter the purification of the target pre-miRNA, the project was focused on the development \n\nof delivery systems able to encapsulate, protect and promote the delivery of pre-miR-29b to \n\nthe target cells. Initially, as described in paper VIII, a systematic study of three polymers, \n\n\n\n \n\n 258 \n\npolyethylenimine (PEI), chitosan (CS) and poly(allylamine), with different structural \n\ncharacteristics (such as molecular weights, charge densities and backbone structure) was \n\nperformed, in order to design a successful non-viral delivery system for small RNAs. The \n\npolymers of PEI and CS stood out in the condensation of small RNA as well as in relation to its \n\nphysicochemical characteristics, namely size, zeta potential, morphology, encapsulation \n\nefficiency and complex stability. \n\nIn the previous papers it was possible to develop efficient methodologies to recover pre-miR-\n\n29b with a high purity degree, in particular with arginine-agarose matrix. Thus, in the paper \n\nIX, is described how the recombinant pre-miR-29b was condensed and some systems were \n\nprepared and characterized to encapsulate and protect the pre-miR-29b activity. All of the \n\npolyplexes demonstrated high loading capacity, small sizes and exhibited a strong positive \n\ncharge on their surface. Moreover, the results showed that the levels of human BACE1 protein \n\nexpression were significantly decreased, by approximately 80%, in cells transfected with \n\npolyplexes loaded with recombinant pre-miR-29b relatively to untreated cells and cells \n\ntreated with scrambled RNA and miR-29 synthetic. Consequently, endogenous A?42 levels \n\nwere also significantly reduced in about 45%. It is important to highlight that the therapeutic \n\neffect of pre-miR-29b in BACE1 mRNA silencing was also achieved, with a mRNA reduction of \n\napproximately 77% in cells transfected with CS-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b and 69% in those \n\ntransfected by PEI-SA-Lf/pre-miR-29b. Overall, these results showed that the miR-29b can \n\ninduce the suppression of the expression levels of A? peptides in neuronal cells, showing a \n\ncausal relationship between miR-29b expression and BACE1 activity, and, consequently, A? \n\ngeneration. Considering the application of the pre-miR-29b in the brain, the delivery systems \n\npreviously characterized were functionalized with ligands, to facilitate their access and \n\ninteraction with specific molecules expressed on the surface of BBB endothelial cells. In the \n\npaper X, it was demonstrated that CS functionalized with lactoferrin and stearic acid cross \n\nthe BBB quickly and with high transfection efficiency, causing an increase of the pre-miRNAs \n\nconcentration in the brain.  \n\nAccording to the results obtained in this doctoral research work and comparing with \n\npreviously published data, it was developed a biotechnological platform that allows \n\nbiosynthesis, purification and transfection of the recombinant pre-miR-29b using polyplexes. \n\nWith the successful implementation of this methodology it was obtained the highest decrease \n\never reported for the hBACE1 and endogenous A?42 expression levels in AD model cells. \n\nOverall, the development and implementation of these cutting-edge approaches allows \n\nobtaining high quantities of pure pre-miR-29b, in its biologically active form, for further \n\napplication in many molecular biology subjects. This approach also provides the basis for the \n\nimprovement of the currently available methodologies of microRNA-based therapeutics, not \n\nonly for neurological disorders but also for other diseases, and can be translated to additional \n\ntherapeutic targets that may be of potential clinical interest in the future. \n\n\n\n \n\n 259 \n\nFuture trends \n\n \nOverall, it can be asserted that the main aims of this research work were fulfilled. However \n\nseveral challenging questions arisen that can be addressed as future perspectives. The \n\nintegration of innovative affinity chromatographic strategies in the global bioprocess of pre-\n\nmiR-29b biosynthesis and purification will be required for removing the host contaminants \n\nfrom the extracellular pre-miR-29b. Thus, the development of a selective strategy for \n\nefficiently isolate the extracellular pre-miR-29b will allow recovering this target miRNA \n\ndirectly from the culture medium without cells lysis and, consequently, without employing \n\norganic solvents and other harmful reagents. \n\nFollowing the work already performed, more studies can be developed to motivate the \n\nimprovement of the already implemented chromatographic techniques or the establishment \n\nof new purification approaches. In this way, in order to improve the specificity, selectivity \n\nand throughput of the bioseparation methodology for purification of the target pre-miRNAs, \n\nother affinity purification strategies can be implemented, using other immobilized amino \n\nacids, its derivatives or peptides or even testing other specific ligands like complementary \n\nnucleotide sequences to pre-miRNAs. These ligands could be immobilized onto different \n\nchromatographic matrices, such as agarose-based and monoliths to purify pre-miRNAs from \n\nthe constituents of culture medium, expecting the improvement of the process performance, \n\nnamely considering the purification degree and recovery yield.  \n\nLikewise, it is extremely necessary to understand the phenomenon of biorecognition, since \n\nthe identification of the interactions involved in the isolation of pre-miRNA can be very \n\nimportant, allowing the control and manipulation of the chromatographic conditions \n\nresponsible for the recognition of the pre-miRNA molecules. Accordingly, to characterize the \n\nbinding recognition, as well as the thermodynamic parameters underlying the main \n\ninteraction mechanism between pre-miRNAs and the different affinity ligands, and to \n\ndetermine the magnitude of kinetics and/or affinity constants, it could be used Nuclear \n\nMagnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Flow Microcalorimetry (FMC) and Surface Plasmon \n\nResonance (SPR), respectively. Furthermore, in order to fully characterize and compare the \n\nnovel supports, dynamic binding capacity studies with target pre-miRNAs can be performed \n\nunder different operation conditions (e.g. feed concentration, flow rate, pH and salt \n\nconcentration), allowing the establishment of the best ligands and conditions to purify the \n\ntarget pre-miRNAs. \n\nOn the other hand, to improve the delivery of pre-miRNA therapeutics to the cells and the \n\ncellular response, different delivery systems based on polymers, such as polymeric \n\nnanoparticles (e.g. Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) and poloxamer micelles (Pluronic\u00ae block \n\ncopolymers) can be developed and characterized. Moreover, as these systems are so \n\n\n\n \n\n 260 \n\nversatile, they can be functionalized with brain-targeting molecules, either on their surface \n\nor on the polymeric network, to be recognized by cell surface receptors of BBB, and promote \n\ntargeting to specific cells and tissues. \n\nWith the successful implementation of these methodologies, it could be further evaluated the \n\ntherapeutic function of the recombinant pre-miRNA in in vivo studies and test its efficacy in \n\nimproving cognition and biochemical hallmarks of disease, using mice models of AD (3xTg and \n\nAPPswe/PSEN1?E9). To accomplish this objective, several studies are required to establish \n\nthe range of doses and administration routes to be employed in the pharmacological studies \n\n(biodistribution/pharmacokinetics and toxicity studies). Finally, it could also be evaluated \n\nand compared the performance of recombinant pre-miRNAs and conventional therapeutic \n\ndrugs. These studies should be first performed in vitro, but the development of some in vivo \n\nstudies could bring important insights about the efficacy and safety of gene therapy, either \n\nused separately or in combination with conventional drugs, opening a new prospect of cure, \n\ndue to the possible synergistic effect."}]}}}
