Localizada na porcao sudoeste da Bacia do Sao Francisco, a area abrangida pela Folha Serra Selada (1:100.000) contem rochas sedimentares deformadas do Grupo Bambu \u00ed (Neoproterozoico), localmente recobertas, em pronunciada discordancia, pelos sedimentos e depositos vulcanoclasticos/epicl\u00e1sticos cretaceos dos grupos Areado e Mata da Corda, respectivamente.

O outro e marcado por anomalias de alta frequ\u00eancia (AAF), representando os depositos vulconoclasticos/epiclasticos do Grupo Mata da Corda. O Grupo Bambu \u00ed exibe teores de K e Th intermediarios a altos (1 a 3% e 10 a 16 ppm, respectivamente), enquanto os teores de U giram em torno de 2,5 ppm. Esse dados mostram algumas variacoes, geralmente influenciadas pela distribuyo dos diferentes litotipos, feicoes estruturais e ocorr\u00eancia de emanacoes de hidrocarbonetos. Os sedimentos do Grupo Areado, por sua vez, mostram baixos conteudos de K, Th e U (<1%,&lt;10 ppm e&lt;2 ppm, respectivamente).

Its west, northwest and east limits coincide with the craton limits, whereas its south limit has an erosive nature. The northeastern limit, along Setentrional Serra do Espinhaco, borders the Paramirim Corridor, that corresponds to an intracratonic deformation zone (Alkmim et al., 1993). Located in the southwest portion of the basin, in Minas Gerais, Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000) is delimited by the geographical coordinates 45\u00b030\u2019-46\u00b000\u2019W and 18\u00b030\u2019-19\u00b000\u2019S, and covers an area of approximately 3.000 km2. The quadrangle comprises part of Patos de Minas, Tres Marias and Paracatu micro-regions, and it can be accessed from Belo Horizonte by BR262 highway (300 km) as well as BR040 highway (250 km) (Fig. 1).\nThe first detailed studies in the Serra Selada quadrangle were carried out by PETROBRAS and METAMIG (included today in CODEMIG), between the 60s and 80s decades, mainly focusing the prospecting of gaseous hydrocarbons (Fugita &amp; Clark F, 2001; Araujo, 1988 apud Pinto et al., 2001). The achieved discoveries subsequently aroused the development of regional recognition works, including geophysical and geochemical surveys. In parallel, also in the 70s decade, geologic mapping campaigns were developed at a scale of 1:250.000. They covered the entire region of Tres Marias (Menezes-Filho et al., 1977). In 2003 again, surface geological surveys at scales of 1:250.000 and 1:100.000 were performed ina large part of Sao Francisco Basin (e.g.: Signorelli et al., 2003). Recently, the area was covered by the mapping survey of Alto Paranaiba Project (Pedrosa-Soares et al., 2011), and corresponds to one of the exploratory blocks conceded by the Brazilian National Petroleum Agency (ANP) to the ORTENG / CODEMIG / IMETAME / CEMIG / Sipet / Agropastoril consortium. Important subsuperficial accumulations of gaseous hydrocarbons have already been found in this region.\nThe identification of the geophysical patterns and their correlation with geological field data are routine tools to understand the local tectonic-stratigraphic context. In this way, the interpretation of radiometric and potential field information seems to be very useful for both geologic mapping support and identification of targets for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration (e.g.: Menezes et al., 2006; Carneiro &amp; Barbosa, 2008; Matolin et al., 2008).\nIn this work, aeromagnetometric and aerogammaespectro-metric data of Serra Selada Quadrangle region are analyzed, and\nonce integrated, allow the delimiting of different lithological packages, as well as the recognition of structures and magnetic bodies, either cropping out or buried. Since they show a good correlation with the geological data obtained on surface, these surveys are important to individualize units and discover new geological features.\nGEOLOGIC CONTEXT\nSao Francisco Basin (Fig. 1) covers the meridional sector of the homonymous craton (Almeida, 1977). Stratigraphically, contains records successive basinal cycles younger than 1,8 Ga (Alkmim &amp; Martins-Neto, 2001), which include Precambrian deposits, partially deformed and metamorphosed, to undeformed, Permo-carboniferous and Cretaceous sequences and associated covers (e.g.: Dardenne, 1981; Campos &amp; Dardenne, 1997a; 1997b).\nThe Precambrian deposits are distributed along four distinct structural compartments in Sao Francisco Basin (Alkmim et al., 1993). Three of them are deformed and show structures with centripetal vergency They occupy the east, west and northwest boundaries of the basin, and they represent the intracratonic expression of the Ara\u00e7uai, Brasilia and Riacho do Pontal belts, respectively. On the other hand, along the central sector, such sediments are little-deformed to non-deformed.\nSERRA SELADA QUADRANGLE GEOLOGY\nIn this area there are Neoproterozoic deposits of the Bambui Group, sediments of the Areado Group and volcanic rocks of the Mata da Corda Group, both Cretaceous in age, and Cenozoic covers (Reis, 2011).\nBambui Group\nThe Bambui Group presents a maximum outcropping thickness of ca. 1200 m, represented at the surface by Lagoa do Jacare, Serra da Saudade and Tres Marias formations (Fig. 2).\nLagoa do Jacare formation is characterized by a succession of grayish carbonates with some contribution of marls and terrigenous fractions. Laminated/stratified calcilutites and fine-grained calcarenites are the main lithologies, with local contributions of rudites and siltstones. The formation occurs in the western area, showing N-S oriented bodies tectonically inverted over the sediments of Serra da Saudade Formation.\nSerra da Saudade Formation, which mostly occurs in Serra Selada Quadrangle, is mainly composed by grey to greenish siltstones/sandstones and claystones (the green ones known as verdetes), with plane-parallel lamination/stratification. Marls and calcarenites, sometimes containing oolitic fractions and through\n46\u00b0OOW\t44\u00b000W\nFigure 1 - Location map of Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000) in the Sao Francisco Basin, showing the main highway access from Belo Horizonte, as well as the main local cities (BH: Belo Horizonte, TM: Tr\u00eas Marias and TI: Tiros).\n45\u00b030W\n46\u00b000W\nCOVERS\t\tCENOZOIC\nB MATA DA CORDA GROUP \u25a0 AREADO GROUP\t\tMESOZOIC\nTrfis Marias Formation\t0.\t\nSerra da Saudade FormattorT\t2\t\nLagoa Formosa Formation | Lagoa do Jacar\u00e9 Formation\t2 C\tNEOPROTEROZOIC\nStructures\nNormal fault\nSyncline Anticline\nThrust fault\nInferred thrust fault\nInferred normal fault Left-lateral strike-slip fault\nSeepage zone\tRivers\nFigure 2 -Simplified geological map of Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000), modified after Reis (2010).\ncross-bedding structures, are also described. Towards the top, the psamitic contribution increases significantly, with common intercalations of metric quartz-sandstone beds or centimetric sandy lenses with hummocky cross-bedding structures.\nLagoa Formosa Formation, in turn, is composed by laminated siltstones and claystones associated, to the west, with mono to polymitic diamictites. Apparently, these deposits are correlated to Serra da Saudade Formation units.\nTres Marias Formation lays gradationally over Serra da Saudade Formation sediments. It is composed by micaceous finegrained sandstones, arcosean sandstones, arkoses and claystones. It presents plane-parallel strata, planar cross-stratifications, hummocky structures, ripple marks, load structures wave cross-bedding.\nSub-surface and field survey data indicates two structural domains for Neoproterozoic Bambui rocks in the area of Serra Selada Quadrangle: to the west, a sector where the rocks are deformed; to the east, a compartment where the deposits were not affected by compressional deformation. In the first, the Bambui lithotypes are involved in a fold-and-thrust belt with a general N-S direction. Synclinoria and anticlinoria with hinges pending to N and NNE are delimited by large inverse faults, like the Galena and Rio Borrachudo faults, besides others with smaller throw (Fig. 2). Such faults coupled to a large detachment zone located in the base of Bambui Group (Coelho et al., 2005; Coelho, 2007). In the undeformed domain, northeast sector (and extreme E) of the area, deposits from Upper Bambui Group are horizontal, with scarce gentle to open folds, as well as isolated kink bands.\nAreado and Mata da Corda Groups\nOverlaying the Precambrian sediments, above a prominent angular and erosive unconformity, there are Cretaceous deposits of the Areado Group (Campos &amp; Dardenne, 1997a; Sgarbi et al., 2001; Sgarbi, 2011a). In the domains of Serra Selada Quadrangle, the Areado Group consists mainly of aeolian sandstones,\nassociated to fluvio-deltaic (?) (clast-supported conglomerates and poorly sorted sandstones) and lacustrine (mudstone and lithic sandstones with carbonate matrix) deposits.\nThe volcanoclastic and sedimentary rocks of Mata da Corda Group lays over the Areado Group. They are represented by ciner-itic tuffs, lapilli tuffs, agglomerates, volcanic breccia (locally), and also conglomerates and epiclastic sandstones. Its basal contact with Areado Group has an angular and erosive nature, directly related to the beginning of an important alkaline magmatic event that affected a large part of Central Brazil in Upper Cretaceous and constitutes the Minas-Goias Alkaline Province (Sgarbi &amp; Gaspar, 2001 apudSgarbi et al., 2001).\nBoth Cretaceous units are regionally undeformed, exhibiting, however, local diastrophic structures. In a basin sense, they constitute the Barremian-Maastrichtian fill of the Sanfranciscana Basin, as defined by Campos &amp; Dardenne (1997a; 1997b).\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe geophysical data used in this work were provided by Companhia de Desenvolvimento de Minas Gerais (CODEMIG) and are part of Minas Gerais State Aerogeophysics Survey Program - 2005/2006. Serra Selada Quadrangle is included in Area 9 of this survey (Joao Pinheiro-Presidente Olegario-Tiros), which comprises Biquinhas, Carmo do Paranaiba, Cedro do Abaete, Joao Pinheiro, Lagoa Formosa, Morada Nova de Minas, Paineiras, Patos de Minas, Presidente Olegario, Sao Goncalo do Abaete, Tiros and Varjao de Minas counties (Fig. 3).\n48\u00b0\t-46\u00b0\t-44\u00b0\t-42\u00b0\t-40\u00b0\t-38\u00b0\t-36\u00b0\nFigure 3 - Area 9 location, Aerogeophysical Survey Program of Minas Gerais State (2005/2006). Source: Lasa (2007).\nThe main parameters of data acquisition were (Lasa, 2007):\n\u2022\tFlight line direction: N-S;\n\u2022\tFlight line spacing: 0.4 km;\n\u2022\tControl line direction: E-W;\n\u2022\tControl line spacing: 8.0 km;\n\u2022\tInterval between the consecutive geophysical measurements: 0.10s (magnetometer) and 1.0s (gamma-ray spectrometer);\n\u2022\tAverage flight height: 100 m;\n\u2022\tApproximate flight speed: 270 km/h.\nThe Anomalous Magnetic Field Map, Vertical Gradient (first-order) of the Anomalous Field Map, Residual Field Map and Analytical Signal Amplitude Map, as well as the gamma-ray spectrometry maps in K, Th and K channels and ternary image mage were generated, using the Oasis montaj\u00ae software (GEOSOFT) (Fig. 4).\nRESULTS\nMagnetometry\nFrom the Anomalous Magnetic Field Map (IGRF - International Geomagnetic Reference Field-removed), it is possible to distin\nguish two domains, one that is composed by high frequency anomalies (HFA) and another one that is characterized by low frequency anomalies (LFA; Fig. 5). Considering the frequency/depth relation of the magnetic anomalies, it can be inferred that they are shallow and deep anomalies, respectively. The deeper anomalies should correspond to the response of the basement and constitute the local magnetometric background.\nIn both domains, magnetometric lineaments are observed oriented preferentially in the NE direction, but in the high frequency domain, a larger contribution of ENE lineaments is observed locally (Fig. 5). It is important to note that in the centersouthern part of the quadrangle, as well as in its NNE part, there are marked anomalies with ENE to E-W direction, respectively, in the LFA Domain. Due to the different polarization, it can be deduced that the magnetization occurred in distinct moments for each domain. Also in Figure 5, it is possible to identify a NW-trending and well-marked lineament in the NE and SE quadrants. Apparently, this lineament is younger than the LFA Domain anomalies and older than the HFA Domain anomalies.\nAs the high frequency anomalies were highlighted in Vertical Gradient (first-order) and Residual of the Anomalous Magnetic Field maps (Figs. 6 and 7), they are likely related to shallow bodies. On the other hand, the low frequency anomalies corre-\nFigure 4 - Flowchart of the aeromagnetometric and aerogamma-ray spectrometry data processing in the creation of geophysical maps of Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000).\n45\u00b03QW\n-20,62\n18\u00b030S\nDatum: South American 1969\n23S Zone\n46&amp;00W\nAnomalous Field Intensity nT\n19\u201900S\nFigure 5 - Anomalous Magnetic Field Map (IGRF removed) of Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000).

In the Residual Magnetic Field Map (Fig. 7), it is also possible to observe anomalies oriented according to the main drainages that intersect the mapped area, as well as the low relative depth of the NW-trending anomalous source. It is important to remember that filters applied in vertical gradient magnetometric maps are appropriate to highlight shallow sources, without necessarily altering the polarity of the magnetic anomalies (Carneiro &amp; Barbosa, 2008).\nIn field, the high frequency domain (HFA) is related to the vol-canic/volcanoclastic and epiclastic units of Mata da Corda Group, which exhibit considerable quantities of Ti-magnetite (Sgarbi, 2011b), thus explaining its geophysical behavior. The subtler\nhigh frequency anomalies in the SE region of the quadrangle correspond to a lateritic cover, associated to Neoproterozoic finegrained rocks.\nThe lowfrequency domain (LFA), however, seems to reflect, in large part, the basement behavior, since the Bambui Group sediments as well as the Areado Group deposits do not present significant quantities of ferromagnetic minerals. Thus, the large dipoles NE oriented in the northeast and center-north portions of the quadrangle would represent basement highs and lows, respectively. Such hypothesis is in accordance with interpreted seismic sections and structures observed on surface (Reis et al., 2010).\nThe NW oriented anomaly, persistent in large part of the quadrangle, may represent unexposed mafic dike. Similar dikes\nFigure 6 - First Vertical Derivative of the Anomalous Field Map, Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000). The black traces correspond to interpreted magnetic lineaments.\nwere described along the meridional portion of Sao Francisco Basin and belong to families of NW-trending magnetic lineaments. Carneiro &amp; Oliveira (2005 in Carneiro &amp; Barbosa, 2008) obtained 39Ar/40Ar ages equal to 1,7 Gafor such magmatism, suggesting a relation with the Estaterian rifting events described in the adjacent belts of the Sao Francisco Craton (e.g.: Knauer, 2007; Valeriano et al., 2004).\nThus, considering the Analytical Signal Amplitude Map (Fig. 8) it is possible to delimit the main outcropping magnetic bodies of Mata da Corda Group and associated eluvial covers, as well as demarcate the main lateritic-detritic covers distributed in the SE and E regions of the quadrangle. On the other hand, the Residual Field Map may indicate superficial concentrations of ferromagnetic minerals along the main drainage axes (Fig. 7).\nConsidering the occurrence of diamantiferous placers along the Abaete, Borrachudo and Indaia rivers, some of these ferromagnetic minerals would constitute important indicators for the diamond prospecting.\nGamma-ray spectrometry\nThe gamma-ray spectrometry data exhibit, in general, three large domain, which are directly related to the three main outcropping geological units: Bambui, Areado and Mata da Corda groups (and respective Cenozoic covers) (Fig. 9). For this reason, the domains will be described here according to the units they represent and will be analyzed using a relative scale (from low to high) of values recorded in the limits of the work area.\nFigure 7 - Anomalous Residual Field Map, Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000). Superficial anomalous bodies are distributed in topographically elevated regions, in the W and central portions of the quadrangle, as well as along the main drainage axes. These propably correspond to magnetic mineral concentrations in alluvial sediments.\nBambui Group\nIt presents intermediate to high K contents (between 1 and 3%). Based on field data, it is concluded that the highs are mainly related to the lithotypes of Tres Marias Formation (specially arkose and arcosean sandstone) and to the mudstones of the Lagoa Formosa and Serra da Saudade formations. Such concentration can be explained by the presence of feldspar in the arcosean packages, as well as potassium adsorption capacity of potassium by clay minerals. The green mudstones and fine-grained sandstones (verdetes) of Serra da Saudade Formation represent important potassium sources, as they are rich in glauconite minerals (Lima et al., 2007). Therefore, they correspond to remarkable features on gamma-ray spectrometry map - K Channel (Fig. 9).\nThe Bambui Group exhibits, in Serra Selada Quadrangle, medium to high Th contents, which vary from 10 to 16 ppm. Its units exhibit higher concentrations in the center-north, east and northeast regions of the quadrangle, where they are related to arcosean sandstones and arkoses of Tres Marias Formation. More elevated contents, located in the center-south portion of the quadrangle, can be related to the upper sandstones of Serra da Saudade Formation (Fig. 9). The largest concentrations in the SE and E regions (around 20 ppm) are directly associated to the lateritic covers, commonly related to the undeformed fine-grained deposits of Bambui Group. In this case, its relative concentration could be explained by the extreme immobility of thorium during weathering processes. Once associated to heavy minerals like monazite and zircon, the high relative values of Th the psamitic\n18\u00b030S\n2 1 O\nFigure keys\nI I Eluvial lateritic-detritic covers o Lateritic-detritic covers\nI Mata da Corda Group\nDatum: South American 1969\n23S Zone\n46\u00b000W\nFigure 8 - Superimposition of the Analytical Signal Amplitude Map and the main outcropping magnetic units (compiled from field data), Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000).\nN\n\nfractions may be directly related to a larger concentration of these minerals in sandstones.\nOn U-Channel, the Neoproterozoic deposits show intermediate values (around 2,5 ppm), with greater contents (>3,5 ppm) associated to the lateritic covers of southeast and east portions of quadrangle. Similarly to Th, the uranium is relatively immobile during weathering processes, which explains its higher concentration on these deposits.\nIn general, carbonate rocks exhibit lower K and Th contents.\nImportant NNE to NNW trending lineaments can be delineated by the K and Th channels. They correspond to remarkable structures on Geocover-Landsat image and trend parallel to metric/decametric fold hinges and other associated fracture systems, which are typical of the western deformed compartment. Extensive K and Th highs along the Rio Borrachudo valley and\nin the west part of quadrangle represent important thrust faults that only affect the Neoproterozoic deposits. Apparently, this elevated concentration can be the result of hydrothermal fluid percolation and the consequent illitization of clays along the faults and respective damage surfaces. In a similar way, the elevated thorium and potassium content, denoting NE oriented lineament in the eastern sector (Fig. 9), may correspond to the surface expression of the Tracadal Fault, which is not mapped in the Serra Selada Quadrangle limits.\nIt is also necessary to highlight the existence of elevated K contents in the extreme northeast of the quadrangle (around 3%, Tres Marias Dam region). Taking into account the occurrence of important natural gas seeps and subsuperficial accumulations in the region, as well as in other areas, these \u201canomalous\u201d concentrations may be related to the potassium leaching\nChannel Th\nChannel U\nTernary Image\n45'30W\nNormal Fault\n'V Thrust fault\nI - , T\nFigure 9 -Aerogamma-ray spectrometry in K, Th and U channels in Serra Selada Quadrangle area (1.100.000).

The meteoric water acidification, promoted by compounds like carbon dioxide that are present in hydrocarbon systems, would be one of the main agents responsible for the element transport (Matolin et al., 2008). Potassium ions are extremely mobile and seem to be highly soluble at pH lower than 7.\nTable 1 summarizes the main outcropping rocks of Bambui Group and their aerogamma-ray spectromety responses.\nAreado Group\nIn general, the outcropping rocks and the associated covers of this group exhibit low content of potassium (<1%), low Th (<10 ppm) and low U (<2 ppm). These low values can be explained by the leaching of soluble elements during the weathering (like the case of K), as well as by the original low contents of the sediments. For the first case, it is important to note that these units occur in topographically elevated regions, where intense weathering processes occur.\nMata da Corda Group\nThe lithotypes and covers related to this unit exhibit a low potassium content (near zero) and high thorium and uranium relative contents (higher than 20 and 3 ppm, respectively). Although being related to magmatic rocks of potassic/ultrapotassic affinity in other points of the basin (Campos &amp; Dardenne, 1997a; Sgarbi, 2011b), the lack of significant quantities of potassium can be directly related to intense weathering and leaching on the top of the plateaus. On the other hand, the elevated contents of thorium and uranium can be explained by the higher natural concentration of\nthese elements in volcanic and/or volcanoclastic units, as well as by their low mobility in relation to the weathering processes.\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000), the Neoproterozoic rocks of Bambui Group are the main units, being locally covered by sedimentary and volcanoclastic/epiclastic rocks of the Cretaceous Areado and Mata da Corda groups. These lithotypes exhibit distinct magnetometric and gamma-ray spectrometry characteristics, locally strongly influenced by tectonic processes.\nThe Bambui Group is marked by low magnetic values. Huge low frequency anomalies (LFA) are related to the substrate and are expressed as NE oriented dipoles in the northeast and centernorth sectors of the quadrangle. Subsurface data suggest that these magnetic anomalies correspond to highs and lows of the basement (Reis et al., 2010). Lagoa do Jacare, Serra da Saudade/Lagoa Formosa and Tres Marias Formations rocks exhibit distinct gamma-ray spectrometry patterns (Table 1), of which K and Th concentrations underwent significant redistributions along Neoproterozoic thrust faults. Apparently, the potassium contents seem to show intensive influence of the natural gas accumulations in the NE sector of the quadrangle (Fig. 10). In this way, the redistribution would have been influenced by the action of acids related to hydrocarbon accumulations.\nAreado Group sediments exhibit low magnetization and low radionuclide contents. These values result from the rocks composition as well as from the weathering processes acting in more elevated regions, where they occur.\nFigure 10 - Potassium contents (K%) along a section (A-B) N-S oriented that intersects the seepage zone of Northeastern Serra Selada Quadrangle. The potassium contents were obtained from the Gamma-ray spectrometry Map - K channel, presented in Figure 9. Locations of the emanation zones and respective sections are in Figures 2 and 9, respectively.\nTable 1 - Gamma-ray spectrometry response of the main Bambui Group lithologies in the area comprised by Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000).\nLithotype\tArkoses, arcosean sandstones\tClaystones and Siltstones\tVerdetes\tCarbonates\nStratigraphic unit\tTres Marias and Serra da Saudade\tSerra da Saudade, Lagoa Formosa and Tres Marias\tSerra da Saudade\tLagoa do Jacar\u00e9\nResponse in K channel\tHigh\tIntermediate to High\tHigh\tLow\nResponse in Th channel\tIntermediate/High\tIntermediate\tIntermediate\tIntermediate/Low\nResponse in U channel\tIntermediate\tIntermediate\tIntermediate\tIntermediate/Low\nMata da Corda Group rocks present relatively elevated magnetometric values due to their high concentration in magnetic minerals. Besides, they exhibit elevated Th and U concentrations (>20 and 3 ppm, respectively), apparently influenced by the relative concentration of these elements during the weathering. Weathering would also be the responsible for the low K concentration on the tops of the plateaus.\nThe different Cenozoic covers can be easily delimited in Analytical Signal Amplitude maps (lateritic covers; southeast sector of the quadrangle), as well as due to their elevated U and Th concentration (imobile elements during the weathering processes).\nThe obtained results show the extensive applicability of the magnetometric and aerogamma-ray spetrometry methods to individualize the different lithological units and tectonic structures. In the Serra Selada Quadrangle (1:100.000), the comparison with geological field data (Fig. 2) constituted an important step to understand the tectonic-stratigraphic arrangement of the transition sector between the Western Deformed Domain of Sao Francisco Basin and the Central Undeformed Domain (sensu Alkmim et al., 1993). Considering the prospective potentiality of the region, such data configure the first steps to delimit the potential accumu-lation/migration zones of gaseous hydrocarbons. It is important to note that, due to lower cost and recurring success in applying these techniques, the analysis of potential and radiometric geophysical data has been increasingly used for hydrocarbon exploration (e.g.: Nabighian et al., 2005).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe authors would like to thank Companhia de Desenvolvimento Economico de Minas Gerais (CODEMIG) for financing the field researches and providing the aerogeophysical data, and also Centro de Pesquisa Manoel Teixeira da Costa (CPMTC) for the logistic support and infrastructure.
