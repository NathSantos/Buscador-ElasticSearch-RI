Steep hillsides, combined with traditional\ncultivation practices, have caused rapid degradation\nof natural resources, contributing to a worsening of\nthe cycle of poverty. Traditional cultivation practices\nare characterized by the use of draft animals to till the\nsoil prior to transplant tobacco seedlings. There is no\nsoil conservation practices and an excessive use of\nagrochemicals. In addition, the period of greatest rainfall\nerosivity coincides with the beginning of the planting\ncycle, when soil cover is minimal (SILVA, 2004). This\ncombination of factors favours runoff erosion and the\ntransfer of sediment to rivers.

Longer-term investigations of British rivers\nshows evidence of increases in the nutrient content of\nsediment deposited in the flood plain store (WALLING,\n1999). In an effort to attenuate this situation in southern\nBrazil, the government has implemented programmes\nthat include the introduction of soil conservation\npractices, with the goal of reducing erosion rates (SAA,\n1999). To evaluate the effectiveness of these\nprogrammes, an environmental monitoring project was\ninitiated in 2001 to quantify the impact of the\nconservation practices on soil quality, the\nhydrosedimentological regime, and water quality, in a\nsmall rural catchment. In 2003, a 20% increase in the\nprice of tobacco stimulated an expansion of the\ncultivated area, with results measurable through the\nmonitoring programme. This study presents the\nmonitoring results, showing the link between sediment\nyield and land-use pressure, triggered by economic\nfactors.\n\nThe catchment being monitored measures\n1.33km2 and includes the headwaters of the Lajeado\nFerreira Stream, a small tributary of the Guapor\u00e9 River\nlocated in Arvorezinha county, state of Rio Grande do\nSul. Altitude varies between 560 and 740m. The geology\nis predominantly basalt, with rolling terrain in the upper\nportion (7% average slope), and steeply rolling terrain,\ncharacterized by short slopes and box canyons, in the\nlower two-thirds. Average channel slope is 9%, with\nrunoff concentration time varying between 20 and 50\nmin. Predominant soils are Inceptisols and Entisols.\nAverage annual precipitation is 1605mm.\nSocioeconomic indicators classify the region as\npossessing one of the highest indices of rural poverty\nin the state of Rio Grande do Sul.\n\nTo evaluate the hydrological and\nsedimentological variables of the catchment, an\nautomatic meteorological station, four raingauges, and\na Parshall flume with an automatic water level sensor\nwere installed. The rate of suspended sediment\ndischarge was determined indirectly using US DH-48\nand Single Stage sampler (CARVALHO, 1994).\nTransport of suspended sediment only occurs during\nrainstorms, so the frequency of sediment sampling\ncorresponds with the majority of these events.\nSediment yield was calculated based on the sampled\nevents, using hydrographs and sedimentographs.\nChanges in soil use were determined by field surveys,\nassisted by a GPS with Spring/INPE\u00ae software. Principal\nsoil uses in the catchment consist of cultivated tobacco\nfields, pasture, fallow, and forest. Fields showing signs\n\nof reduced productivity typically are left fallow for at\nleast two years. The category forest includes areas of\nnative forest, trees planted to supply firewood for\ndrying tobacco, and riparian zones.\n\nSignificant changes in soil use were\nmeasured in the catchment during 2003. A 37.7%\nincrease in cultivated area occurred at the expense of\nother soil uses, especially forested areas, which were\nreduced in 19.9%. Of special note, riparian vegetation\nwas diminished by 10%. It increased the sediment\ntransfer from the hillslopes to the channel, as riparian\nvegetation plays a key role in retaining sediment. A\nsecond aspect was a drastic change in lowland area.\nMany lowlands adjacent to the Lajeado Ferreira Stream\nwere drained during the first half of 2003 and put into\ncultivation, thus contributing to an increase in surface\nrunoff and the creation of new sediment sources. In\n2002, the frequency of low flows (<2.9L s-1) was 1.6%,\nwhile in 2003 it increased to 36%. At the same time,\nfloods of much greater intensity were observed in 2003.\n\nThe expansion of the area under tobacco\ncultivation that occurred in 2003 significantly altered\nthe sediment balance for the catchment. This was\nregistered by increases in the frequency of higher\nsuspended sediment concentrations and in increasing\nsediment yield. A comparison between 2002 and 2003\nclearly indicates that in 2003 there was a greater\nfrequency of concentrations greater than 600mg L-1,\nwhereas in 2002, concentrations of less than 450mg L-1\npredominated (Figure 1).\n\nThe average flow rate and precipitation in\n2003 were slightly lower than in 2002; however, there\nwere flow spikes of up to 6000L s-1 during 2003, whereas\nin 2002, the highest flow rate did not exceed 1200L s-1\n(Table 1). This fact is certainly associated with wetland\ndrainage and with the larger area of soil exposed during\nfield preparation.\n\nValues for precipitation, erosivity, flow rate,\nand sediment yield were grouped according to the\ndifferent activities involved in tobacco production\n(Table 1). Sediment yield in 2003 (91Mg km-2 year-1)\nwas 25% higher than in 2002 (73Mg km-2 year-1) (Table 1).\nDuring the period from July to October alone, sediment\nyield for 2003 approximated the total yearly yield for\n2002. It is interesting to note that 80% of the sediment\nyield for 2003 occurred during three rainfall events\nregistered in July. This was due to the presence of\ncountless newly worked areas, especially in the\nheadwaters of the Lajeado Ferreira Stream, in which\nriparian vegetation had been removed, as well as to the\npresence of large quantities of sediment deposited next\nto the stream channel as a result of wetland drainage. It\nis also worth noting that the sediment yield values for\n\n\n\n671Impact on sediment yield due to the intensification of tabacco production in a catchment in Southern Brazil.\n\nCi\u00eancia Rural, v.36, n.2, mar-abr, 2006.\n\nthe catchment are much higher than those found during\na 1998 survey of principal Brazilian rivers, in which the\nsediment yield for the middle section of the Guapor\u00e9\nRiver was estimated at around 23Mg km-2 year-1\n(ELETROBR\u00c1S, 1998).\n\nIn field surveys carried out after the events,\nmany gullies were observed in the steeper areas where\nrunoff erosion was more severe, as well as a striking\nchange in the morphology of the stream channel due\nto sediment deposition. It is likely that these deposits\nwill constitute an important sediment source during\nthe next few years, contributing significantly to the\ncatchment\u2019s sediment yield.\n\nFigure 1 - Frequency histogra of suspended sediment concentration for the Arvorezinha catchment during the two monitoring periods.\n\nBased on the monitoring results of the\nhydrological and sedimentological characteristics of\nthe Lajeado Ferreira Stream, it was possible to conclude\nthat the shift to more intensive tobacco production in\necologically-fragile areas, such as wetlands, riparian\nzones, and steep slopes, resulted in severe impacts on\nthe hydrological system and sediment yield. Given that\ntobacco is grown by very poor farmers on marginal\nlands, the economic stimulus represented by a price\nincrease can greatly accelerate the process of\nenvironmental degradation, unless accompanied by an\nequal or greater stimulus to implement adequate\nenvironmental protection, especially improved soil\nmanagement practices.\n\nTable 1 - Precipitation, erosivity, average flow rate, number of measured events and sediment yield for the Lajeado Ferreira Stream\ncatchment.\n\nVariables Jan.\u2013Mar.
