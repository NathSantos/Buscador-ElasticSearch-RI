From \n\nprofessional learnings to personal improvement, I only have to thank this country and all the \n\npeople that I have met so far and those who have supported me during the time of my stay.  \n\n First of all, I would like to give a special thanks to my supervisors from IPB, professors \n\nSim\u00e3o Pinho and Olga Ferreira, for the opportunity to perform this work and for all their \n\ndedication, patience, encouragement, guidance, open discussions and friendship. Sometimes they \n\nhave been more than supervisors, but truly friends.   \n\n I also express my gratitude to professor Luciano Fernandes, my supervisor from UTFPR, \n\nfor his support, availability, enlightening discussions and friendship. His support really \n\nencouraged me to come to Portugal to develop this project.  \n\n I cannot let to thank professors Juliana Peitrobelli, Priscila Leite and Erica Lovo for \n\noffering me the opportunity to attend the Double Degree Program formed by the partnership of \n\nUTFPR and IPB.  I also thank all the professors, from UTFPR and IPB, who have been part of \n\nmy journey helping me to finish this work.  \n\n Special thanks to Laboratory of Separation and Reaction Engineering (LSRE) for \n\nproviding me all the facilities and equipment to reach the outcomes of this work.  \n\n I am immensely grateful to my parents, Antonio Sergio and Elaine, and to my brother, \n\nCarlos Eduardo, for all their understanding, care, incentive and confidence since I decided to \n\ncome to Portugal.

Furthermore, solubility studies play a key role to \n\nobtain a significant yield and a representative product, being an important parameter for the \n\ndevelopment of new drugs as well as the optimization of already existent processes. In this \n\ncontext, the main objective of this work is to measure the solubility of gallic, protocatechuic, \n\ngentisic and ?-resorcylic acids in water and organic solvents (methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, \n\nisopropanol, 2-butanone, ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide and acetonitrile) at 298.15 and \n\n313.15 K and to employ the NRTL-SAC thermodynamic model coupled to the Reference \n\nSolvent Approach (RSA) to describe the solubility data. \n\nThe experimental methodology was the shake-flask method coupled to the gravimetric \n\nmethod and, in general, the results obtained were satisfactorily consistent with the information \n\navailable in literature for gallic and protocatechuic acids. For gentisic and ?-resorcylic acids, no \n\nsolubility studies were found at the analyzed temperatures until now. Melting points and \n\nenthalpies of fusion of the selected phenolic acids were also measured via Differential Scanning \n\nCalorimetry (DSC).  \n\nFinally, the NRTL-SAC segment descriptors were obtained by fitting the solubility data \n\nin seven solvents, obtaining average relative deviations (ARD) between 25 and 34%. The model \n\nwas then applied to predict the solubility in 1-propanol and dimethylformamide and the ARD% \n\nwere 70 and 78%, respectively. Those values are satisfactory for semi-predictive models, using a \n\nlimited set of solvents, showing that the NRTL-SAC is adequate to model binary systems \n\ncontaining the selected phenolic acids. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: solubility, phenolic acids, NRTL-SAC. \n\n \n\n\n\nvi \n\n \n\nResumo  \n\n \n\n Compostos fen\u00f3licos geralmente agem como antioxidantes e sequestradores de radicais \n\nlivres, possuindo diversas aplica\u00e7\u00f5es pr\u00e1ticas, tais como em processos farmac\u00eauticos, \n\naliment\u00edcios, na ind\u00fastria de petr\u00f3leo e na ind\u00fastria qu\u00edmica. Dentre esses compostos, os \u00e1cidos \n\nfen\u00f3licos representam um grupo amplamente presente in alguns produtos naturais, apresentando \n\npropriedades interessantes, como preventivos de algumas doen\u00e7as degenerativas, o que os torna \n\namplamente utilizados na ind\u00fastria farmac\u00eautica. Al\u00e9m disso, estudos de solubilidade \n\ndesempenham um papel chave para a obten\u00e7\u00e3o de rendimentos significativos e produtos \n\nrepresentativos na ind\u00fastria farmac\u00eautica, sendo a solubilidade um par\u00e2metro primordial no \n\ndesenvolvimento de novos medicamentos bem como na otimiza\u00e7\u00e3o de processos j\u00e1 \n\nimplementados. Nesse contexto, o principal objetivo deste trabalho \u00e9 a medi\u00e7\u00e3o de solubilidade \n\ndos \u00e1cidos g\u00e1lico, protocatechuico, gent\u00edsico e ?-resorc\u00edlico em \u00e1gua e em solventes org\u00e2nicos \n\n(metanol, etanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 2-butanona, acetato de etilo, acetonitrilo e \n\ndimetilformamida) a 298,15 e 313,15 K e aplicar o modelo termodin\u00e2mico NRTL-SAC \n\ncombinado com a abordagem do Solvente Refer\u00eancia para descrever os dados de solubilidade. \n\n A metodologia experimental utilizada foi o m\u00e9todo do frasco agitado combinado com o \n\nm\u00e9todo gravim\u00e9trico e, em geral, os resultados obtidos foram consistentes com a informa\u00e7\u00e3o \n\ndispon\u00edvel na literatura para os \u00e1cidos g\u00e1lico e protocatechuico. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos \u00e1cidos gent\u00edsico \n\ne ?-resorc\u00edlico, nenhum estudo de solubilidade foi encontrado nas temperaturas analisadas at\u00e9 o \n\nmomento. Pontos e entalpias de fus\u00e3o dos compostos selecionados tamb\u00e9m foram medidos por \n\nCalorimetria Diferencial de Varrimento (DSC).  \n\nFinalmente, os descritores de segmentos NRTL-SAC forram obtidos atrav\u00e9s de ajuste de \n\ndados de solubilidade em sete solventes, obtendo-se um erro relativo m\u00e9dio (ARD) entre 25 e \n\n34%.  O modelo foi ent\u00e3o aplicado na previs\u00e3o da solubilidade em 1-propanol e em \n\ndimetilformamida e os ARD% foram de 70 e 78%, respectivamente. Esses valores s\u00e3o \n\nsatisfat\u00f3rios para modelos semipreditivos, com base em um pequeno conjunto de solventes, o \n\nque indica o modelo NRTL-SAC como adequado para modelar sistemas bin\u00e1rios contendo os \n\n\u00e1cidos fen\u00f3licos selecionados. \n\nPalavras-chave: solubilidade, \u00e1cidos fen\u00f3licos, NRTL-SAC. \n\n\n\nvii \n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nviii \n\n \n\nTable of Contents  \n\n \n\nList of Symbols and Acronyms .................................................................................................. xii \n\nList of Tables ............................................................................................................................... xv \n\nList of Figures ........................................................................................................................... xviii \n\nChapter 1 Introduction .................................................................................................................... 1 \n\n1.1 Importance and Objectives .................................................................................................... 1 \n\n1.2 Contents ................................................................................................................................. 1 \n\nChapter 2 State of Art .................................................................................................................. 3 \n\n2.1 Phenolic Compounds............................................................................................................. 3 \n\n2.2 Importance of Solubility Measurements ............................................................................... 5 \n\n2.3 Experimental Work ............................................................................................................... 6 \n\n2.3.1 Experimental Methods .................................................................................................... 6 \n\n2.3.2 Analytical Methods \u2013 Shake-Flask Technique ............................................................... 6 \n\n2.3.3 Experimental Database ................................................................................................... 8 \n\n2.4 Thermodynamic Modeling .................................................................................................. 12 \n\n2.4.1 Review of Models to Calculate Phase Equilibria ......................................................... 12 \n\n2.4.2 Non-Random Two-Liquid Segment Activity Coefficient Model (NRTL-SAC) ......... 14 \n\n2.4.2.1 NRTL-SAC Model Equations ................................................................................... 15 \n\n2.4.2.2 NRTL-SAC Applications .......................................................................................... 18 \n\n2.4.3 Reference Solvent Approach (RSA)............................................................................. 21 \n\n2.4.3.1 Thermodynamic Framework ..................................................................................... 22 \n\n2.4.3.2 Reference Solvent Approach ..................................................................................... 23 \n\nChapter 3 Solubility Measurements .......................................................................................... 25 \n\n\n\nix \n\n \n\n3.1.

In particular, the solubility of phenolic \n\ncompounds in water and organic solvents plays an important role in the design of separation \n\nprocesses such as extraction, precipitation or crystallization in the food, pharmaceutical, and \n\ncosmetic industries.  \n\nPrevious work, carried out in our research group, was focused on the solubility of some \n\nnatural phenolic compounds in water (Mota et al. 2008) and the solubility of flavonoids in pure \n\norganic solvents (Ferreira &amp; Pinho 2012) or mixed solvents (Ferreira et al. 2013). In this context, \n\nthe main objective of this master thesis is to extend those studies to a group of phenolic acids \n\n(gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, gentisic acid and ?-resorcylic acid) by establishing an \n\nexperimental work plan to measure their solubility in water and organic solvents (methanol, \n\nethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, butanone, ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide and acetonitrile) at \n\n298.15 and 313.15 K and by applying the NRTL-SAC thermodynamic model to describe the \n\nexperimental data.  \n\n1.2 Contents \n\n \n\nChapter 2 starts with a brief description of the chemical and biological properties of the \n\nphenolic compounds selected in this work, considering also their current scientific and industrial \n\napplications. The most common experimental methods to measure the solubility of solids in \n\nliquids are also described. Special attention was given to the traditional shake-flask method, \n\nwhich was applied to perform the experimental measurements. Moreover, a literature review \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\nfocusing on solubility measurements of the four compounds evaluated in this work was also \n\nperformed. This chapter finishes with the presentation of the main thermodynamic models \n\ngenerally used to describe the low pressure solid-liquid equilibria, their applications, range and \n\nlimitations with particular emphasis given to the NRTL-SAC model.  \n\nThe experimental materials and methods are described in Chapter 3. This chapter also \n\ncontains the experimental solubility results as well as the melting properties measurements. \n\nChapter 4 is dedicated to the thermodynamic modeling of the solubility results presented in \n\nChapter 3, by applying the NRTL-SAC model. Finally, in Chapter 5, the main conclusions are \n\nsummarized and some suggestions for future work are pointed out.  \n\n  \n\n\n\n3 \n\n \n\nChapter 2 State of Art  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1 Phenolic Compounds \n\nPhenolic compounds are a chemical family whose members have one or more hydroxyl \n\ngroups directly attached to an aromatic ring. They are abundant in fruit, aromatic herbs and \n\nvegetables and are well known to have the capacity of scavenging free radicals and oxidizing \n\ncompounds, which is related to their hydrogen-bonding ability and aromaticity (De Oliveira &amp; \n\nBastos 2011; Vermerris &amp; Nicholson 2009). Those substances have several applications, from \n\nanti-antioxidants in the food and oil industry, up to antiviral and anti-inflammatory activity that \n\ncan be exploited by the pharmaceutical industry. In another perspective, some are considered \n\ntoxic to a large number of bacteria, indicating that phenolic compounds could also be used in the \n\nwastewater common treatment (Noubigh et al. 2013; De Oliveira &amp; Bastos 2011). \n\nOther studies report that some phenolic compounds may be applied in medicine as \n\ncardioprotective agents and retardants in cancer cell multiplication (Ferguson et al. 2005; Obied \n\net al. 2005). In 2004, Kampa et al. studied the inhibitory effect of some phenolic acids, including \n\nthe sinapic acid and the protocatechuic acid, on the human breast cancer T47D cells growth, in \n\nvitro. In addition, the low incidence of coronary diseases and atherosclerosis presented by people \n\nwho consume olive oil regularly was related to its high content of phenolic compounds (de \n\nLorgeril et al. 1999).  \n\n As mentioned before, four phenolic acids, will be studied here in more detail: gallic acid, \n\nprotocatechuic acid, gentisic acid and ?-resorcylic acid. Their chemical structures are presented \n\nin Figure 2.1. \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n    \n\n(a) (b) (c) (d) \n\nFigure 2.1: Chemical Structures of: (a) gallic acid; (b) protocatechuic acid; (c) gentisic acid and (d) ?-resorcylic \n\nacid. \n\nGallic acid (GA, 3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoic acid) is widely distributed in fruits and plants \n\nand has many industrial applications, such as antioxidant in food and oil companies, source \n\nmaterial for the manufacturing of inks and colors, anti-cancer and antimicrobial agent for the \n\ndrug industry and raw material for the chemical synthesis of propyl gallate and trimetropim (Ow \n\n&amp; Stupans 2003; Mota et al. 2010).   \n\nFurthermore, Liu et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2009) reported that gallic acid is a very \n\nstrong inhibitor of kappa-casein (k-CN), a milk protein associated to the formation of amyloid, a \n\nsubstance related to the development of several human diseases, such as Alzheimer\u2019s, \n\nParkinson\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s diseases. \n\n Protocatechuic acid (PCA, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) is also largely found in some \n\nfruits and vegetables, such as in acai, mango, grapes, green propolis and yellow and red onions. \n\nIn addition, high quantities of protocatechuic acid were identified in some plants, such as \n\nIndigofera hirsute, Camelina sativa seeds and Scutellaria barbata, widely used in the Chinese \n\nmedicine (Paula et al. 2016; Vermerris &amp; Nicholson 2009). This compound, due to its strong \n\nantioxidant activity, has the property of preventing the germination of onion smudge fungus, \n\nColletotrichum circinans, which means that the protocatechuic acid may be used as a barrier for \n\nprotecting onion\u2019s crops (Vermerris &amp; Nicholson 2009). It can also bring benefits to the human \n\nbody, such as anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic effects. Another study shows that PCA \n\nenhances the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme that is related to prevention of \n\nsome neurodegenerative diseases (Hatzipanayioti &amp; Petropouleas 2010).  \n\n Gentisic acid (GEA, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) is also a phenolic compound that has \n\nsimilar  biological characteristics to gallic acid and protocatechuic acid, such as antioxidant, anti-\n\ninflammatory and antimutagenic properties  (Nafees et al. 2012). Other studies indicate \n\n\n\n5 \n\n \n\nalternative uses for this compound. Vrsalovi? et al. (2010) published a work concluding that \n\ngentisic acid acts as a very good inhibitor of the corrosion of aluminum-magnesium alloys \n\n(Vrsalovi? et al. 2010).  Also, gentisic acid presents laboratory application as sample matrix for \n\nlaser desorption-ionization (LDI) and has shown acceptable results to detect peptides (Strupat, \n\nK.; Karas, M.; Hillenkamp 1991). \n\n Finally, ?-resorcylic acid (RA, 3,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) is a phenolic acid found in \n\nhuman urine. In the few studies encountered about this compound, this acid is considered a good \n\ninhibitor for lipolysis in adipocyte (Liu et al. 2012). In addition, ?-resorcylic acid may be used to \n\ncondense hyperbranched polyesters, substances that are attracting attention as novel optical, \n\nelectronic and magnetic materials (Gao &amp; Yan 2004; Mansour et al. 2005).  \n\n 2.2 Importance of Solubility Measurements \n\nSolubility may be described as the property that measures the ability of one substance \n\n(solute) to dissolve within another (solvent) in chemical equilibrium, describing whether they \n\nmix up easily or not. Therefore, it is a quantitative term that plays an important role in the \n\nbehavior of systems containing chemical substances (Martins et al. 2013). Moreover, solubility \n\nstudies in different solvents provide essential information for the design of separation process, \n\nsuch as precipitation, crystallization and superficial fluid extraction in the food, pharmaceutical, \n\ncosmetic and chemical areas (Letcher et al. 2007; Noubigh et al. 2013). \n\nThe solubility of an organic compound is directly related to its molecular structure and \n\nthe polarity of the molecular bonds of solute and solvent. Usually, polar solutes tend to dissolve \n\nbetter in polar solvents, whereas apolar or weakly polar substances are more likely to be \n\ndissolved in less polar systems. Actually, the solubility of solids or liquids in another liquid will \n\nonly occur if the interaction between the solute and the solvent is sufficiently high to promote the \n\nrupture of the solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions. Also, the entropy change, which is \n\nrelated to the system\u2019s temperature, is a factor that should be considered to evaluate whether a \n\nsubstance dissolves easily or not in a solvent (Martins et al. 2013).   \n\n The solubility has particular relevance in the pharmaceutical industry for which one of \n\nthe most challenging aims is the discovery of new drugs and formulations that have to be \n\nroutinely tested. To perform those tests and optimize the drugs\u2019 formulation, a large amount of \n\nwater solubility data are required as this property is directly related to a drug\u2019s pharmacokinetic \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nproperties, and consequently, its effects in human organism (Mota et al. 2010; Martins et al. \n\n2013; Baka et al. 2008).  \n\n    The solubility data in organic solvents, among other properties, are also important to the \n\nprocess and product design in the pharmaceutical industry. The chemical species responsible for \n\nthe desired activity, usually called active ingredient, is generally isolated via crystallization, \n\nrequiring solubility data to design the process (Mota et al. 2010). \n\n2.3 Experimental Work  \n\nIn this section, a literature review is presented regarding experimental methods to \n\nmeasure solubility of solids in liquids, as well as a database containing the solubility of the four \n\nselected compounds (gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, gentisic acid and ?-resorcylic acid) in \n\nwater and organic solvents already reported by other authors.   \n\n2.3.1 Experimental Methods \n\nThe solubility of solids in liquids can be measured by several direct methods, which are \n\nusually classified as analytical or synthetic methods. While the former requires the chemical \n\nanalysis of the liquid and solid phases in equilibrium to determine the solubility of the solid, in \n\nthe synthetic methods, the solubility is measured by varying a thermodynamic property of the \n\nsystem, such as temperature, pressure or composition, avoiding any chemical analysis (Hefter &amp; \n\nTomkins 2003).  \n\n2.3.2 Analytical Methods \u2013 Shake-Flask Technique  \n\nThe analytical methods are considered the most classical approach and are usually based \n\nin the saturated shake-flask methodology, proposed more than 50 years ago and still offering \n\nsatisfactory reliability to measure the solubility of several systems. The basic idea of this method \n\nconsists on adding an excess amount of solute to the solvent, where a saturated solution should \n\nbe formed, and the solubility is measured under isothermal-isobaric conditions (Hefter &amp; \n\nTomkins 2003; Baka et al. 2008; Shefter &amp; Higuchi 1963). A sample prepared at saturated \n\nconditions is thermostatized and kept under agitation until the system reaches the equilibrium, \n\nwhich may vary between 12 hours and 7 days, depending on the solute and the solvent natures, \n\nagitation employed, the amount of material used and the equilibrium method applied (Apley et \n\nal. 2015). When the equilibrium is achieved, the remaining solid, also called residue, is removed \n\n\n\n7 \n\n \n\nfrom the supernatant (mother solution) by filtration or centrifugation, and then the concentration \n\nof the solute in the solution can be determined. Various analytical techniques may be used to \n\nidentify the solubility of the solid in the mother solution, such as gravimetry, UV-Vis \n\nspectroscopy, HPLC and X-ray diffraction (Hefter &amp; Tomkins 2003; Mota et al. 2010).  \n\nFor poorly soluble systems, the time required to reach the equilibrium is normally higher \n\nthan for systems containing soluble solutes. One way to speed up the process is to increase the \n\nsurface available area for dissolution, which can be achieved by either vortexing or sonicating \n\nthe samples during the process. Other challenges in determining the solubility of poorly soluble \n\nsolids are their tendency to float (Apley et al. 2015). \n\nIn order to achieve reliable measurements, it is essential to ensure that the equilibrium \n\nstate is reached, which can be obtained by studying the solute\u2019s dissolution profile in the system. \n\nThe shortest time required to obtain a constant solute concentration can be considered as a \n\nsuitable equilibrium time, which can be easily obtained by isothermal gravimetry. In this method, \n\na super-saturated mother solution is prepared and maintained stirred and under isothermal-\n\nisobaric conditions while several samples are collected at different times. The supernatant is then \n\nremoved from the samples and the remaining solid part is weighted. When there is no \n\nconsiderable variation in the solid solubility, the equilibrium is reached (Hefter &amp; Tomkins \n\n2003). \n\nAlthough requiring longer times of experimental work, the gravimetric method of \n\nanalysis can be considered quite accurate and reproducible to perform solubility measurements in \n\npure and mixed solvents. It may present some loss issues when applied to systems containing \n\nlipophilic insoluble compounds, as well as some limitations due to the retention of solvent in the \n\nsolid inner interstices (Mota et al. 2010).   \n\nUV-Vis spectroscopy allows solubility measurements of several systems due to the large \n\nwavelength range that can be applied and correlated to a calibration curve previously built. They \n\nalso provide satisfactory reproducibility and speed of analysis and impurities can be easily \n\nidentified. However, when the UV absorption decreases, the uncertainty of the solubility results \n\nconsiderably increases (Mota et al. 2010). \n\nHigh performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a powerful analytical technique that \n\ncan be coupled to a saturated solution generation column to measure aqueous solubilities. It can \n\nreduce colloidal dispersions, solute adsorption in the material walls, minimize sample loss by \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nevaporation and the use of organic solvents (Mota et al. 2010). On the other hand, HPLC is \n\nconsidered a time consuming technique because it requires long runs and a calibration curve to \n\nbe correlated to the desired parameter (Lin et al. 2009).   \n\nEven though the shake-flask method is considered one of the simplest procedures to \n\ndetermine equilibrium solubilities, it is time consuming and requires lots of manual work. The \n\nreliability of the results depends on a rigorous control of external variables, such as temperature, \n\npressure, sedimentation time, stirring time and technique applied to separate the solid and the \n\nliquid phases (Baka et al. 2008) \n\nIn order to minimize the experimental error involved in the shake-flask method, Baka et \n\nal. (2008) recommend some procedures that should be observed while performing the \n\nexperimental work: \n\n? The measurements must be carried out at controlled, standard temperature; \n\n? The amount of solid in excess present in the solution should be around 1 - 2 mg/ml of \n\nsolution, to avoid difficulties in sampling; \n\n? Equilibrium time must be checked for each compound studied. However, a minimum \n\ntime to reach the equilibrium should be around 24 hours, summing 6 hours of stirring and \n\n18 hours for sedimentation.  \n\nAccording to these authors, when the procedures above mentioned are strictly followed, \n\nthe experimental error of the solubility measurements can be reduced to about 4 % (Baka et al. \n\n2008).  \n\n2.3.3 Experimental Database   \n\nFor comparison purposes, a literature review of the experimental methodology employed \n\nby other authors in similar analysis was performed.

For instance, the solubility of GA in water provided by Lu and Lu \n\n(2007) are generally lower than the results reported by Mota et al. (2008) and Daneshfar et al. \n\n(2008). Those differences may be due to the different experimental methodologies including the \n\nanalytical techniques employed. Lu &amp; Lu (2007) applied the shake-flask methodology coupled \n\nwith HPLC, stirring the samples during 2 hours, what may not be enough time to reach the \n\nequilibrium state. Daneshfar et al. (2008) employed UV-Vis spectroscopy technique to quantify \n\nthe solubility and 3 hours for the stirring time.  \n\nOn the other hand, few solubility data were found for gentisic acid (see Table 2.2.) in line \n\nwith the scarce applications described before.

Even with the constant improvement of the \n\nanalytical equipment, experimental works focused on solubility measurements usually take \n\nsubstantial time to be performed and must be carried out very rigorously to achieve reliable \n\nresults (Mota et al. 2010).  \n\nIn many cases, solubility data are unavailable due to time restrictions and limited amount \n\nof samples. In addition, given the complexity of most drug molecules and the large diversity of \n\ntheir interactions, solubility may be measured very easily in simple systems, but it can be very \n\ncomplex task, for instance, when the system contain multicomponent solvents (Mota et al. 2012)  \n\nIn order to model, complement and support the experimental measurements, many \n\nthermodynamic methods have been proposed. Among those tools, there are some theoretical \n\nmodels that rely on information about the molecules under study, and others that are based on \n\nmathematical correlations of the experimental data. Some semi-empirical models may be applied \n\nto several non-ideal binary or multicomponent systems and describe their thermodynamic \n\nbehavior. (Chen &amp; Song 2004; Mota et al. 2011) \n\n2.4.1 Review of Models to Calculate Phase Equilibria \n\nSome of the most commonly thermodynamic models used to predict the equilibrium of \n\ndrugs in the pharmaceutical industry are the models of Wilson, UNIQUAC, NRTL, Hansen, \n\nUNIFAC, NRTL-SAC, among others (Letcher et al. 2007; Prausnitz et al. 1999).  \n\nWilson\u2019s model, one of the first thermodynamic methods proposed to determine a non-\n\nideal equilibrium, is based on molecular considerations for binary and miscible systems. The \n\nmodel has two adjustable parameters, ?12 and ?21, which are related to the pure-component molar \n\nvolumes and to the interaction energies, and can be obtained, for binary systems from \n\nexperimental data. Generally, in practical applications, the systems of interest are \n\nmulticomponent or multiphase systems (Farajnezhad et al. 2016). For those cases, the \n\nmulticomponent system may be considered composed by several binary systems, which \n\ngenerates more Wilson\u2019s interaction parameters that usually are not available in literature. An \n\n\n\n13 \n\n \n\nalternative way to determine those parameters requires the knowledge of several experimental \n\nsolubility data to be fitted and applicable for further calculations (Farajnezhad et al. 2016). \n\nAlthough Wilson\u2019s method was one of the first applied models, it has some restrictions. \n\nThe first disadvantage is that those equations are not useful for systems where the logarithms of \n\nthe activity coefficients reach maxima or minima. Another limitation is that the Wilson\u2019s model \n\nshou1d only be used to predict solubilities involving completely miscible liquid systems or, else, \n\nfor those limited regions where just one liquid phase is present (Rowlinson 1970). \n\nTo overcome some of the limitations of Wilson\u2019s method, some other models were \n\ndeveloped boosted by the necessity of measuring solubilities of pharmaceuticals and polymers. \n\nHansen model is based on the Hansen solubility parameters, which are obtained from \n\nmathematical regression of experimental solubility data (Srinivas et al. 2009). It was formulated \n\nbased on the fact that solubility parameters have shown great industrial application to aid in \n\nsolvent selection, being considered a correlative model (Hansen 2013).  \n\nA well-known category of thermodynamic predictive models follows a group \n\ncontribution methodology, which is based on the concept that the properties of a molecule can be \n\nderived from the functional groups that compose it (Nouar et al. 2016). The most successful \n\nmethod based on the functional group concept is the Universal Functional-Group Activity \n\nCoefficients (UNIFAC) model, which has been constantly applied to predict vapor-liquid, liquid-\n\nliquid and solid-liquid equilibria (Nouar et al. 2016). By using chemical structure information \n\nfrom the molecules that compose the studied system and some binary interaction coefficients, the \n\nmodel calculates activity coefficients of the components present in solution, and consequently, \n\ndetermines the system equilibrium (Chen &amp; Song 2004; Nouar et al. 2016). \n\nAlthough both UNIFAC and Hansen models fit well many systems, they have some \n\nlimitations. For instance, they are inadequate to estimate the solubility of either large molar \n\nweigh molecules (above 200 g/mol) or systems containing electrolyte solutes (Chen &amp; Song \n\n2004). In spite of the fact that Hansen\u2019s model is based on the simple assumption that relates \n\nsolubility parameters to experimental data, the method has limited practical applications \n\nregarding drug solubility (Mota et al. 2010). \n\nThe UNIFAC model is not applicable to predict solubilities from systems containing \n\nisomers or at high pressure, above 10 atmospheres (Pistikopoulos et al. 2010). Furthermore, in \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\nsome cases, the parameters for certain functional groups and binary interactions are not available \n\nmaking the UNIFAC method unsuitable (Pistikopoulos et al. 2010; Valavi et al. 2016). \n\nSimilarly to the Wilson\u2019s model, Renon and Prausnitz (1968) also considered the local \n\ncomposition concept to derivate the Non-Random Two-Liquid (NRTL) model, which is one of \n\nthe most successful thermodynamic models in the chemical industry to provide precise \n\npresentation of nonideal VLE and LLE systems (Chen &amp; Song 2004). The following equation \n\ndescribes the NRTL activity for a multicomponent system: \n\n   ?? ?? =  ??\n2 [??? (\n\n???\n\n??+?????\n)\n\n2\n\n+  \n??????\n\n(??+?????)\n2]                      (1) \n\nwith Gij and ?ij defined as follows:  \n\n  ??? = exp(???? ??? ) ???                                  (2) \n\nThe parameter  ???  also can be calculated through the following expression: \n\nexp(???? ??? ) ??? =\n???????\n\n??\n=\n\n???\n\n??\n   (3) \n\nwhere gij is the energy interaction between i and j molecules, ? is the non-randomness factor, T is \n\nabsolute temperature of the system and R is the ideal gas constant (Renon &amp; Prausnitz 1968). \n\nThe model requires three binary interaction parameters that are determined by regression of \n\nexperimental data to a specific system: a12, a21 and ?12. The reduction of experimental data \n\nindicates that ?12 varies from 0.2 to 0.47 for a large number of binary systems, which suggests \n\nthat this parameter can be fixed when the experimental data are scarce (Rowlinson 1970). \n\nFor moderate nonideal systems, the NTRL model provides no advantages over the \n\nsimpler Wilson\u2019s models. However, this model predicts more accurately the solubility of very \n\nnonideal systems, composed by partially immiscible phases (Rowlinson 1970). The model has \n\nshown to be very precise to determine some equilibrium properties; for instance it has been used \n\nto correlate the solubility of niflumic acid, flufenamic acid and diclofenac sodium in different \n\nsolvents, reporting a deviation of 2% from the experimental solubility measurements (Valavi et \n\nal. 2016).   \n\n2.4.2 Non-Random Two-Liquid Segment Activity Coefficient Model (NRTL-SAC) \n\n\n\n15 \n\n \n\n In 2004, Chen and Song, considering the successful range of the NRTL industrial \n\napplications, especially in polymer industry, and the mentioned limitations of the group \n\ncontribution models, proposed an innovative variant method to describe liquid-liquid equilibrium \n\nsystems: the NRTL segment activity coefficient (NTRL-SAC) model (Chen &amp; Song 2004; Mota \n\net al. 2010). In this method, the liquid non-idealities are defined in terms of three distinct \n\nconceptual molecules\u2019 segments: hydrophilic, polar and hydrophobic. Those concept segments, \n\nor molecules descriptors, are represented respectively by hexane, acetonitrile and water, and \n\nrepresent the possible surface interactions that a solute and a solvent may have in a binary \n\nsystem. (Chen &amp; Song 2004; Letcher et al. 2007) \n\nBy resorting to an extensive VLE and LLE database of 62 common solvents commonly \n\nused in the pharmaceutical industry and assuming that the non-idealities may be described in \n\nterms of four molecules descriptors, Chen and Song (2004) estimated the number of segments \n\nrequired in each solvent and their values (Letcher et al. 2007). Considering those values and a \n\nfew selected experimental solubility data of the target solute, it\u2019s possible to predict the solute\u2019s \n\nnumber of segments readily and, consequently, use them to estimate its solubility in other \n\nsolvents and systems (Chen &amp; Song 2004; Chen &amp; Crafts 2006). \n\nOne advantage of this method is to require less experimental work to predict a solute\u2019s \n\nsolubility in several solvents (Fakhraian et al. 2016). In addition, NRTL-SAC can be a very \n\nconvenient tool to design a crystallization process due its capability of identifying both solvent \n\nand anti-solvent candidates (Chen &amp; Crafts 2006).       \n\n2.4.2.1 NRTL-SAC Model Equations  \n\n NTRL-SAC model revealed to be a very consistent thermodynamic tool to qualitatively \n\ncorrelate and predict drug solubility of pure and multicomponent systems, based only in a small \n\ninitial set of experimental solubility data (Chen &amp; Crafts 2006). In this model, the activity \n\ncoefficient for a component I present in solution is the sum of a combinatorial term, ?\nc\nI and a \n\nresidual term, ?\nR\n\nI. \n\n              ?? ?? = ln ??\n? + ln ??\n\n?                                     (4) \n\n The combinatorial term, ?\nc\nI, is calculated from the Flory-Huggins equation for the \n\ncombinatorial entropy mixing, as follows: \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\nln ??\n? = ln\n\n??\n\n??\n+ 1 ? ?? ?\n\n??\n\n??\n?                (5) \n\nwhere I and J are component indices, ?? is the segment mole fraction of component I, r1  and rJ \n\nare the total segment number in components I and J and ??  is the molar fraction of component I.   \n\n.  Those terms are calculated by the following expressions: \n\n  ?? =  ? ??,??               (6) \n\n  ?? =  \n????\n\n? ?????\n                                   (7) \n\nwhere i the segment based-species indices, ??  and ?? are the molar fractions of components I and \n\nJ, ??,?  is the number of segment species i contained in component I. \n\nThe residual term, ?\nR\n\nI, is based on the NRTL\u2019s model local composition interaction \n\ncontribution, ?\nlc\n\nI,. which is represented by the following equation: \n\nln ??\n? =  ln ??\n\n?? = ? ??,? [ln ??\n?? ?  ln ??\n\n??,?\n]?            (8) \n\nwhere ??,?  is the number of segments m contained in species I, ??\n??  is the activity coefficient of \n\nsegment species m and ln ??\n??,?\n\n is the activity coefficient of segment species restricted only in \n\ncomponent I. Those terms can be computed from NRTL model\u2019s equation: \n\n    ln ??\n?? =\n\n ? ?????????\n\n? ??????\n+  ?\n\n?\n??\n\n?\n???\n\n? ???????\n?? (???? ?\n\n? ?????? ?????\n\n? ???????\n )               (9) \n\n           ln ??\n??,?\n\n=\n ? ??,????????\n\n? ??,?????\n+  ?\n\n?\n?,??\n\n?\n???\n\n? ??,??????\n?? (???? ?\n\n? ??,????? ?????\n\n? ??,??????\n )                       (10) \n\nwhere i, j, k, m and ?? are the segment-based species indices, I and J are the component indices \n\nand ??  is the segment-based mole fraction of the species j. As in the NRTL model, the NRTL-\n\nSAC has two parameters, G and ?, which are related to each other by the non-randomness factor \n\n?:  \n\n       ? =  ??(?.?)          (11) \n\nIn the NRTL-SAC model, the behavior of the mixtures is determined by the segment \n\ncompositions of the molecules and their pairwise segment-segment interactions, which are \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nrepresented by characteristics of hydrophobicity (X), polarity (Y) and hydrophilicity (Z).  Those \n\nparameters are obtained not from the molecular structures, but from the interaction \n\ncharacteristics of the molecules in solution expressed in terms of their experimental equilibrium \n\ndata (Chen &amp; Song 2004). The local binary quantities and the non-randomness factor were \n\ndetermined to be constants and are shown in appendix B.  \n\nAs mentioned before, the solvents chosen to represent the hydrophobic, polar and \n\nhydrophilic behavior are hexane, acetonitrile and water, respectively. The binary parameters for \n\nhydrophobic (X) and hydrophilic (Z) interactions are obtained from liquid-liquid equilibrium \n\n(LLE) data of hexane-water mixture. The non-randomness factor ? was fixed at 0.2 for these \n\ninteractions because this is the ordinary value for systems that present liquid-liquid separation. \n\nLikewise, the binary parameters for hydrophobic segment (X) \u2013 polar (Y) segment and for polar \n\nsegment (Y) \u2013 hydrophilic segment (Z) were obtained from available data of hexane-acetonitrile \n\nand acetonitrile-water, respectively, which lead the authors to fix ? at 0.2 for both cases (Chen &amp; \n\nSong 2004). On the other hand, the binary parameters for the polar segment (Y) \u2013 hydrophilic (Z) \n\nsegment were obtained from vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data, fixing the non-randomness \n\nfactor at 0.3. Furthermore, the polar segment was subdivided in Y- and Y+ and ?12 was \n\nestablished to vary between -2 and +2 to reflect the fact that interaction between polar segment \n\nand the hydrophilic segment may be positive or negative. It\u2019s also assumed in the model that \n\nthere is no interaction among segments of the same nature, i.e, polar-polar segments (Chen &amp; \n\nSong 2004).  \n\nIn addition to the conceptual segment parameters, the NRTL-SAC also requires \n\nmolecular parameters for the solvents present in the systems that will be analyzed. Those \n\nparameters can be determined from regression of the available LLE and VLE data for binary \n\nsystems of the intended solvent and the reference molecule descriptors (hexane, acetonitrile and \n\nwater). The molecular parameters identified by Chen and Song (2004) for 62 solvents commonly \n\nused in the pharmaceutical industry are presented in appendix B.  \n\n Although three conceptual segments were generally defined, in many cases only one or \n\ntwo molecular parameters are necessary to describe a solvent`s behavior. Therefore, considering \n\nthe parameters expressed in Appendix B and the NRTL-SAC equations, it is possible to estimate \n\nthe activity coefficient of the solute in a binary system, which is directly related to the solute\u2019s \n\nsolubility. \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\nAssuming that the solubility of an organic nonelectrolyte solid can be described by the \n\nexpression:  \n\n ln ??\n??? =  \n\n?????\n\n?\n(1 ?  \n\n??\n\n?\n) ? ln ??\n\n???          (12) \n\n for T ? Tm \n\n      ???? ? =  \n?????\n\n??\n          (13) \n\nwhere  ??\n???  is the mole fraction of the solute I dissolved in the solvent phase at saturation, ???? ? \n\nis the entropy of fusion of the solute, R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature \n\n(measured in Kelvin), Tm is the melting point of the solute, ???? ? is the enthalpy of fusion of the \n\nsolute and ??\n???  is the activity coefficient of the solute at saturation (Frank et al. 1999). The \n\nterms ???? ?, ???? ? and Tm are thermodynamic properties that vary among polymorphic forms of \n\nsolute. Therefore, considering a polymorph at a specific temperature, the solute solubility is only \n\nfunction of its activity coefficient, which can be obtained by the NTRL-SAC model (Chen &amp; \n\nSong 2004; Chen &amp; Crafts 2006).  \n\n2.4.2.2 NRTL-SAC Applications \n\nIn this section, a few applications of the NRTL-SAC model, relevant to this work, will be \n\ndiscussed. Very recently the NRTL-SAC model has shown to be very useful of the in the \n\ndescription of of a set of pharmaceutical compounds in aqueous solution with a reported average \n\nerror of 38%, which may be considered lower compared to other thermodynamic approaches \n\n(Valavi et al. 2016). It is also relevant to mention that NRTL-SAC, unlike other thermodynamic \n\nmodels, ignores temperature dependence of the activity coefficient, which means the influence of \n\ntemperature is only considered on the activity of the solid (Valavi et al. 2016; Chen &amp; Song \n\n2004).  \n\nDespite its empirical nature, this model has shown to be relatively advantageous \n\ncompared to other thermodynamic models due its robustness and accuracy (Valavi et al. 2016). \n\nThe simplicity and the wide applicability of the model, either for organic non-electrolytic and \n\norganic electrolytic molecules, are also points that should be accounted while evaluating the \n\nNRTL-SAC features (Chen &amp; Crafts 2006). Furthermore, Valavi et al. (2016) concluded that \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nNRTL-SAC, when predicting the solubility of pharmaceutical compounds in organic solvents, \n\npresents more accurate results than the group contribution UNIFAC model.   \n\nMota et al. (2010) presented a review of the successful applications of the NRTL-SAC \n\nmodel until 2008. The authors identified that the model has been applied to estimate the \n\nsolubility of complex chemicals, such as acetylsalicylic acid, benzoic acid, testosterone, \n\ntheophylline, estriol, hydrocortisone, among others, obtaining acceptable deviations between \n\nexperimental and predicted values.  \n\nIn order to better evaluate the performance of the NTRL-SAC model, a literature review \n\nof the works published between 2006 and 2016 is compiled in Table 2.3., updating the review \n\nmade by Mota et al. (2008).  \n\nTable 2.3: Literature review of the NRTL-SAC successful applications from 2008 to 2016. \n\nWorks Author \n\nNRTL-SAC presented excellent solubility predictions of paracetamol, sulfadiazine, \n\ncimetidine and sulfamerazine in mixed solvents at 293, 298 and 303 K \n(Chen &amp; Crafts 2006) \n\nPrediction of infinite-dilution activity coefficient data of 22 ionic liquids in 35 solvents.  (Chen et al. 2008) \n\nThe symmetric Nonrandom Two-Liquid Segment Activity Model (e-NRTS-AC) was \n\nproposed for electrolytes and the prediction of salt solubilities in a few representative \n\nsolvents was carried out. They also estimated the solubility of sodium acetate and sodium \n\nsalicylate in water-ethanol mixed solvent. \n\n(Song &amp; Chen 2009) \n\nPrediction of the solubility of paracetamol, budesonide, allopurinol and furosemide in water, \n\nacetone/water, ethanol/water and ethanol/ethyl acetate. \n(Mota et al. 2009) \n\nThe authors designed and compared the crystallization of acetaminophen in ethanol by \n\napplying the Van Laar equation, Wilson\u2019s model, NRTL, NTRL-SAC and UNIFAC models. \n\nThe most precise method found at predicting the equilibrium solubility and the crystal size \n\nwas NRTL-SAC. \n\n(Widenski et al. \n\n2010) \n\nNRTL-SAC, UNIFAC, MOSCED and Jouyban-Acree methods have been used to model and \n\noptimize an isothermal anti-solvent crystallization of acetaminophen in acetone/water \n\nsystems. NRTL-SAC and Jouyban-Acree showed to be the most accurate methods in the \n\nanalyzed situation. \n\n(Widenski et al. \n\n2011) \n\nThe authors combined an original optimization procedure with NRTL-SAC to screen, \n\namong 62 solvents, the best option to perform the crystallization of seven pharmaceutical \n\nmolecules (lovastatin, valsartan, paracetamol, budesonide, allopurinol, furosemide and \n\nsulfadiazine). \n\n(Sheikholeslamzadeh \n\net al. 2012) \n\nSolubility prediction of drug-like molecules, such as salicylic acid, benzoic acid, (Mota et al. 2012) \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\nacetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, hydroquinone, estirol and estradiol in systems containing \n\nethanol, 1-butanol, 1-pentanol, 1-octanol. \n\nThe solubility of three compounds (3-pentadecylphenol, lovastatin, and valsartan) in \n\ndifferent solvents and solvent mixtures was studied. The prediction results showed a better \n\nperformance of the NRTL-SAC model compared to the UNIFAC model. \n\n(Sheikholeslamzadeh \n\n&amp; Rohani 2012) \n\nPrediction of partition coefficients and selection of suitable solvents employed in counter-\n\ncurrent chromatography systems. Several solutes were tested in heptane/methanol/water, \n\nheptane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water (Arizona and hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water \n\nsystems to validate the method). \n\n(Ren et al. 2013) \n\nSolubility predictions of epicatchin, epigallocatechin, epicatchin gallate and epigallocatechin \n\ngallate in water/ethanol mixtures at 293 K and 303 K were performed using UNIFAC and \n\nNRTL-SAC methods.

The extracted phenolic compounds were 3,4-\n\ndihydroxyphenylethanol, vanillic acid, orientin, vitexin, veratric acid, 2''-O-(3''', 4''-\n\ndimethoxybenzoyl) orientin, 2''-O-feruloylorientin, 2''-O-feruloylvitexin, 2''-O-(2'' \n\nmethylbutyryl) vitexin, 2''-0-(2'''-methylbutyryl) isoswertiajaponin, 2''-O-(2'''-methylbutyryl) \n\nisoswertisin and the solvent systems evaluated were composed by different compositions of \n\nhexane/ethyl/acetate/ethanol/methanol/water \n\n(Qin et al. 2015) \n\nBy using eleven solvent system families containing 33 biphasic liquid systems, the authors, \n\nbased on NRTL-SAC model, proposed a systematic and practical solvent system selection \n\nstrategy to predict partition coefficients of eleven more solvent families containing partially \n\nor totally different solvents. \n\n(Ren et al. 2015) \n\nDevelopment of a temperature-dependent NTRL-SAC model applied to systems containing \n\nrisperidone, fenofibrat, fenoxycarb, tolbutamide, meglumine, butyl paraben, butamben, \n\nsalicylamide in organic solvents, such as methanol, toluene, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, \n\n1-butanol, acetone and ethyl acetate \n\n(Valavi et al. 2016) \n\nNRTL-SAC was applied to model ternary phase diagram for chiral medetomidine salts in \n\nalcohols. The systems analyzed were composed by medetominide hydrochloride and 2-\n\npropanol, medetominide hydrobromide and 2-propanol, and medetominide oxalate and \n\nethanol \n\n(Fakhraian et al. \n\n2016) \n\n\n\n21 \n\n \n\nTable 2.3 shows that the NRTL-SAC model has been widely studied since 2006. Some \n\nstudies point the model as a very good tool to assist the design of several separation processes, \n\nsuch as cooling crystallization, isothermal anti-solvent crystallization and counter-current \n\nchromatography. In addition, many works have compared NRTL-SAC with other models, like \n\nUNIFAC, pointing that the segment methodology usually provided the most reliable results.  \n\nBesides the application pointed in Table 2.3, NTRL-SAC was also included in the \n\nthermodynamic library of the commercial software Aspen Properties and Aspen Polymers Plus. \n\nAs mentioned by the ASPEN Technology \u201cNRTL-SAC can be used for fast, qualitative \n\nestimation of the solubility of complex organic compounds in common solvents\u201d (Aspen \n\nTechnology 2010). \n\nTo our knowledge, the NRTL-SAC was not used to predict the solubility of gallic acid, \n\nprotocatechuic acid, gentisic acid and ?-resorcylic acid. However, several authors applied it to \n\ndrug molecules, with complex structures, which lead us to believe that NRTL-SAC may be used \n\nto determine molecule descriptors of the compounds addressed in this work, and consequently \n\ncalculate its solubility in water and organic solvents. \n\n2.4.3 Reference Solvent Approach (RSA) \n\nDespite the robustness and accuracy of some thermodynamic models, prediction of the \n\nsolubility of a solid in organic liquids may find some hindrances. Group-contribution \n\napproaches, such as UNIFAC, require the availability of all the group parameters that compose \n\nthe molecules in the analyzed systems. Although the values can be measured in some cases or be \n\nobtained from similar structures, in many cases the available database is insufficient to estimate \n\nthe missing parameters (Abildskov &amp; O\u2019Connell 2003).  \n\nThe NRTL segment activity coefficient approach, on the contrary, requires only four \n\nparameters for each component in the analyzed system, what is a considerable advantage over \n\nthe UNIFCAC model when the systems are composed by complex molecules. On the other hand, \n\nin order to predict reliable solubility values, the knowledge of the solute\u2019s melting point and \n\nenthalpy of fusion is required. However, those values are not always available and sometimes \n\nthey are not simple to be determined.  \n\nConsidering the limitations mentioned above, Abildskov &amp; O\u2019Connell (2003) proposed \n\nan alternative approach that may be incorporated in the thermodynamic approaches to maximize \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\ntheir realibility and accuracy. The Reference Solvent Approach (RSA) employs one of the \n\nsolected solvents as reference to predict the activity coefficients and solubilities of the same \n\nsolute in different systems. The selection of the reference solvent is related to minimization of \n\nthe errors between the experimental and predicted solubilites, as shown in the next topic.  \n\n2.4.3.1 Thermodynamic Framework \n\nThe solubility of a solid solute in a liquid solvent at equilibrium, when both molecules \n\nhave sufficiently different sizes and shapes that no solid solutions are formed, can be calculated \n\nby: \n\nln ??\n? =  ln ??\n\n?? ? ln ??\n?          (14) \n\nwhere ??\n?  is the solute mole fraction solubility and ??\n\n?  is the solute activity coefficient using the \n\nLewis/Randall standard state (pure component as a liquid at the system temperature T). For \n\nnonideal solutions, ??\n?  needs to be calculated iteratively by equation (14) and thermodynamic \n\nmethods such as UNIFAC and NRTL-SAC may be used to determine the activity coefficient \n\niteratively. The ideal solubility is obtained approximately from the ratio of standard-state \n\nfugacities, generally approximated with the use of the melting properties ???  and ???? , as \n\nshown in the following expression: \n\n                    ln ??\n?? =  \n\n???? \n\n????\n(1 ?  \n\n???\n\n?\n)    (15) \n\nTherefore, the solubility of the solute can be assumed as function of the melting parameters and \n\nactivity coefficient. However, corrections to equation (14) are very important, especially if the \n\nsystem presents solid phase transitions between the system temperatures ? and ???. In several \n\ncases, the solid form of the solute can vary with the solvent, either by crystalline lattice, solute\u2019 \n\nsolvation or compound formation (Shefter &amp; Higuchi 1963; Abildskov &amp; O\u2019Connell 2003). \n\nThose aspects cannot be taken in account in the methodology presented above and accurate \n\nmelting data are required to perform reliable predictions of solubility in solid-liquid systems.  \n\n Considering the discussion pointed above and disregarding any variations of the solid in \n\nthe system, the term represented by equation (15) can be considered constant and the solubility \n\nof the solid S in a solvent i can be calculated as a function of the reference solvent j as shown \n\nbelow: \n\n\n\n23 \n\n \n\nln ??? =  ln ??? + ln ??? (?, {?? }? ) ? ln ??? (?, {?? }? )   (16) \n\nWhere the reference terms in equation (15) can be gathered and written as: \n\n    ????? (?, {?? }? ) =  ln ??? +   ln ??? (?, {?? }? )              (17) \n\nAssuming that the solute solubility in the reference solvent j is obtained experimentally, \n\nthe solute activity coefficient and, consequently, the parameter Ref in equation (17) can be \n\nobtained interactively through robust thermodynamic methods such as UNIFAC, NRTL and \n\nNRTL-SAC in different temperatures. Then, a set of values for equation (17) in different times \n\ncan be combined to one of the mentioned thermodynamic models to predict iteratively the solute\u2019 \n\nsolubility in solvent i through equation (15). The present methodology is very useful when the \n\npure-solute properties are either unknown or very difficult to measure (Abildskov &amp; O\u2019Connell \n\n2003).    \n\n2.4.3.2 Reference Solvent Approach   \n\nDespite RSA cancels errors of measurements or assumption of pure-solute properties, it \n\nrequires the selection of the reference solvent. In order to choose the best solvent option, \n\nAbildskov &amp; O\u2019Connell (2003) proposed the evaluation of the residual term represented by the \n\nfollowing expression: \n\n? ln ??,?? = ln ??? + ln ??? (?, {?? }? ) ?  ????? (?, {?? }? )  (18) \n\nThe residual term represents the error obtained by assuming the solvent j as reference, in \n\nother words, it describes how much the approximation assumed by equation (16) diverge from \n\nreality, especially due to experimental errors or solid phase transitions (Abildskov &amp; O\u2019Connell \n\n2003). In order to obtain the reference solvent, a minimization of the sum of N available residual \n\nterms should be performed, as shown in the following equation: \n\n??? |????? (?, {?? }? ) ?  ?  \nln ???+ln ???(?,{??}?)\n\n???=????\n|   (19) \n\nwhere NP is the total number of data points for the different i solvents in the database (Mota et \n\nal. 2012; Abildskov &amp; O\u2019Connell 2003). This strategy was developed to aid in the selection of \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nthe solvent that adjusts the system better in terms of minimum error. However, it is important to \n\nevaluate the scattering of the data adjusted by the RSA technique.    \n\n\n\n25 \n\n \n\nChapter 3 Solubility Measurements \n \n\n \n\n \n\n3.1.

Lide 2003). \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n3.1.2. Experimental Procedure \n\n As summarized in Table 2.1, all the authors employed the well-known shake-flask \n\nmethodology in order to reach the solid-liquid equilibrium. This technique presents very good \n\nresults for systems that aren\u2019t poorly soluble (Apley et al. 2015) and was selected in this work.   \n\nMoreover, different analytical techniques can be employed to evaluate the solubility in \n\nthe solution after the equilibrium state is achieved. Despite the robustness of UV-Vis \n\nspectroscopy and HPLC approaches, the gravimetric method was selected. Although this \n\ntechnique takes longer to achieve the final results, they are quite accurate in systems that don\u2019t \n\npresent insoluble solutes (Mota et al. 2010).  \n\n3.1.2.1. Isothermal Shake-Flask  \n\n The saturated solutions were prepared by mixing a small amount of solid in excess to the \n\nErlenmeyer flasks containing between 70 and 80 ml of solvent and a magnetic stirrer bar. The \n\nflasks were placed on a plate stirrer inside a thermostatic bath (Lauda Instruments, model E20, \n\nEcoline 025) operating with distilled water, as shown in Figure 3.1. \n\n \n\nFigure 3.1: Experimental setup of the shake-flask methodology.  \n\n All the flasks were covered with aluminum foil to protect the solutions from possible \n\nlight degradation.  \n\n\n\n27 \n\n \n\nConsidering the wide range of shaking and settling times reported on Table 2.3, previous \n\nexperiments were made to determine those conditions for the systems under study. It was found \n\nthat 24 hours and 8 hours are the minimum times to shake and settle the solutions, respectively. \n\nThe actual shaking and settling times employed for each solubility assay performed in this work \n\nare described in Table C.1 of Appendix C.  \n\nFrom the available literature data, the solubility of the solutes in water was expected to be \n\nlower than the solubility in organic solvents. Therefore, to be sure aqueous systems reached the \n\nequilibrium state in 24 hours, the flasks were first placed in an ultrasonic bath (Ultrasons-H, JP \n\nSelecta S.A.), for one hour, at the same temperature employed on the thermostatic bath (298.15 \n\nand 313.15 K). \n\n In order to confirm that the solutions in the bath were saturated, the flasks were checked \n\nperiodically and solid was added when necessary during the stirring process. For the systems \n\nwith no data available in literature (systems with 2-butanone and DMF and all the systems \n\ninvolving gentisic and ?-resorcylic acids), preliminary experiments were performed at ambient \n\ntemperature (around 293 K) by placing the flasks directly over the plate stirrer (Magnetic Stirrer \n\nMSH-300N, BOECO Germany). After reaching a saturated solution with a small quantity of \n\nsolid in excess, the flasks were placed in the bath. This procedure helped to achieve the \n\nequilibrium state more easily and minimized experimental errors.  \n\n After the settling period, three samples with volume varying between 1.5 and 5 ml were \n\ntaken from the supernatant solution, using plastic syringes with metallic needles and placed in a \n\npreviously weighted glass flask (\u00b1 10\n-4\n\n g). The third sample was collected and filtered with \n\npolypropylene filters of 0,45 ?m pore diameter. However, for some flasks containing a large \n\namount of solid in excess, filters were used in the three samples, to prevent the transfer of any \n\nsuspended particle. Figure 3.2 shows the material mentioned above to collect the samples from \n\nthe solutions. \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 3.2: Syringes and filters used to collect the samples from the solutions. \n\n \n\n Each week, the set of first experiments was performed at 298.15 K. Immediately after \n\ncollecting three samples of the Erlenmeyer flask, additional solid was added to each system and \n\nthe flasks returned to the thermostatic bath at 313.15 K.   \n\n3.1.2.2. Gravimetric Method \n\n After the samples were taken from the solution and placed into small flasks, these \n\nwere immediately covered with a screw cap. This procedure should be particularly fast for \n\nsystems containing volatile solvents. Then, the flasks were weighted and put in a hood until all \n\nthe visible solvent evaporated. Afterwards, the samples were transferred to a drying oven \n\noperating at 343.15 K, for at least 7 days. Then, the samples were taken from the drying oven \n\nand placed into a desiccator for 2 hours until their masses were registered again. This procedure \n\nwas repeated for each sample until a constant mass was reached. The average required time to \n\nobtain completely dried samples was usually 20 days. However, dimethylformamide has a \n\nsignificantly higher boiling point than the other solvents and at least 30 days were necessary to \n\nachieve complete dryness.  \n\nIn the gravimetric method, the solubility in weight fraction ?????????can be calculated by \n\nthe following equation: \n\n????????? =\n??+????\n\n??+???+????+?\n      (20) \n\n\n\n29 \n\n \n\nwhere ??+? is the mass of the flask plus the dry solid, ?? is the mass of the flask, ??+?+?  is the \n\nmass of the flask and cap plus the amount of collected solution and ??+?  is the mass of the flask \n\nand cap. The solubility in grams of solute per 100 grams of solvent can be calculated as follows: \n\n? =\n?????????\n\n1? ?????????\n? 100     (21) \n\n3.2. Results and Discussion \n\n3.2.1. Melting temperature and enthalpy  \n\n In addition to the solubility studies,  Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was also \n\nemployed in this work to determine the melting point and the enthalpy of fusion of gallic acid, \n\nprotocatechuic acid, gentisic acid and ?- resorcylic acid. The analyses were performed at the \n\nUniversity of Aveiro and the average results (3 samples per component) are summarized in Table \n\n3.2 (the original DSC thermograms are shown in Appendix D). \n\nThose parameters are essential to evaluate the solubility as shown in equation 11.  \n\n  \n\nTable 3.2: Melting temperature and enthalpy determined experimentally via DSC, in this work. \n\nSubstance Tm (K) ?Hfus (kJ/mol) Observations \n\nGallic Acid  524.2 74.3 ? ?Hfus ? 79.44 \nVery high value.

For gallic acid, Jr et al. \n\n(2016) report a similar value to the one found in this work. \n\nRegarding the enthalpy of fusion, the literature values are more uncertain and less \n\nconsistent with each other. The results found in this work for protocatechuic and ?- resorcylic \n\nacids are close to those found by Vecchio (2013) and Monte et al. (2010), respectively.  \n\nThe major divergence occurred with gallic acid, which started to decompose before \n\nreaching the melting point. Mota et al. (2008) tried to measure the enthalpy of fusion of gallic \n\nacid via DSC and also observed some degradation in the process. Other authors reported values \n\nthat are considerably divergent from each other, which may indicate that DSC technique is \n\nunfeasible to measure the enthalpy of fusion of gallic acid.  \n\nDespite some of the measured enthalpies of fusion being close to those found in \n\nliterature, the thermograms shown in Appendix G indicate very high values, which may include \n\neither enthalpies of sublimation or other parameters related to solid-solid transitions. Also, in \n\n\n\n31 \n\n \n\nsome cases, other peaks were detected, making it difficult to identify the enthalpy of fusion for \n\nthe studied compounds. \n\n3.2.2 Solubility in water and organic solvents \n\n The experimental solubilities obtained in this work at 298.15 K and 313.15 K are shown \n\nin Table 3.4 and Table 3.5, respectively.

In the case of water, ?-resorcylic acid is the most \n\nsoluble solute, followed by gentisic, protocatechuic and gallic acids.  \n\nAs expected, the solubility of these phenolic acids in short-chain alcohols is high, not \n\nonly due the dispersion forces but also to the large number of hydrogen bonds formed between \n\nsolute and solvent (the polarity parameters of all the selected compounds are shown in Tables \n\nF.1. and F.2. of Appendix F). In general, the solubility decreases with the increase of the alkyl \n\nchain of the alcohol with one exception: the solubility of ?-resorcylic acid in 1-propanol is \n\nunexpectedly high and much larger than the solubility in isopropanol.  \n\nA peculiar behavior was also observed in the solubilities of the systems containing 2-\n\nbutanone, acetonitrile and ethyl acetate. In those cases, solubilities of protocatechuic and gentisic \n\nacids are much higher than the solubilities of gallic and ?-resorcylic acids.  \n\nThe coefficients of variation of the experimental data are considerably low, being 1.99% \n\nand 1.60% the maximum values at 298.15 and 313.15 K, respectively (data shown in Tables E.1. \n\nand E.2.). This coefficient of variation is a statistical parameter that helps to evaluate the \n\nprecision and the analytical method employed, which means that the results obtained by the \n\nshake-flask coupled to gravimetric method were quite accurate.  \n\nThe percentages of solubility increase between 298.15 K and 313.15 K are shown in \n\nTable 3.6.  \n\nTable 3.6: Percentage of solubility increase from 298.15 K to 313.15 K for each binary system. \n\nSolvent Gallic Acid  Protocatechuic Acid  Gentisic Acid  ?-Resorcylic Acid  \n\nWater 125.5 135.6 133.4 120.6 \n\nMethanol 7.4 16.7 16.4 20.4 \n\nEthanol 3.3 4.3 13.4 26.2 \n\nIsopropanol 10.9 11.3 35.6 25.5 \n\n1-Propanol 10.5 7.5 14.8 9.6 \n\n2-Butanone -2.7 2.4 11.3 21.4 \n\nEthyl Acetate 10.0 64.6 62.7 52.7 \n\nAcetonitrile 42.1 82.5 43.1 63.4 \n\nDMF 0.11 0.11 0.07 0.12 \n\n \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nIn general, as temperature increases the solubility also increases. This variation is much \n\nstronger in the aqueous systems than in the organic solvents. The exception is the system formed \n\nby gallic acid and 2-butanone, for which a small decrease of 2.7 % in the solubility was detected, \n\nwhich is uncommon, but possible. However, the solubility\u2019s percentages of increase in 2-\n\nbutanone systems are not very high (except for ?-resorcylic acid), which may have led to \n\noversaturation in the system containing gallic acid. Further studies should be performed to check \n\nthe results obtained for this system. \n\nOn the other hand, although solubility values in dimethylformamide were high for the \n\nfour addressed solutes, their percentages of increase from 298.15 K to 313.15 K were very small. \n\nThe highest percentage of increase was obtained for protocatechuic acid in water (135.6 %), and \n\nthe lowest occurred in the system composed by gentisic acid and DMF (0.07 %).  \n\n3.2.3.

In those cases, the equilibrium state may not have been reached, which \n\ncould explain the reason for the solubility values obtained by the authors in the binary systems \n\ncontaining protocatechuic acid and methanol, ethyl acetate and ethanol be inferior to the values \n\nobtained in this work, especially at 298.15 K. In addition, differences in the solid phase may also \n\nexplain the different solubility values.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\nChapter 4 Solubility Modeling \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.1. NRTL-SAC Programming \n\n4.1.1. Methodology and Simulations Conditions \n\n  The NRTL-SAC model and the optimization of the parameters for the four selected \n\ncompounds were implemented using the software MATLAB version R2013a. The selected \n\noptimization algorithm was the MATLAB routine \u201cIsqnonlin\u201d, which is based on nonlinear \n\nleast-squares curve fitting of the objective function (absolute value of the difference between the \n\nexperimental and the calculated solubility data). This algorithm is based on the minimization of \n\nthe following objective function:  \n\n???? ??(?)? = ???? (?1(?)\n2  +  ?2(?)\n\n2. . . +??(?)\n2)  (22) \n\nwhere ?(?) is the relative difference between the experimental and the calculated solubility at \n\neach temperature, obtained by: \n\n?(?) =\n???? ?????\n\n???? \n     (23) \n\nIn order to reduce the number of calculations, bound constraints were considered. The \n\nminimum and maximum values of the NRTL-SAC parameters for all the simulations were set at \n\n0.000 and 3.000, respectively. Those values were fixed considering that the NRTL-SAC \n\nmolecular descriptors cannot be negative and are seldomly higher than 3.000.  \n\n The Reference Solvent Approach (RSA) proposed by Abildskov &amp; O\u2019Connell (2003) \n\nwas also coupled to the NRTL-SAC method, as the available temperature and enthalpy of fusion \n\nare, in some cases, highly uncertain.  \n\nThe main goal of the first set of simulations is to determine the four NRTL-SAC \n\nconceptual molecules\u2019 segments (X, Y\n+\n, Y\n\n-\n, Z) for gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, gentisic acid \n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nand ?-resorcylic acid using part of the solubility data measured here. After, those parameters will \n\nbe used to predict the solubility in a different set of solvents.  \n\n \n\n4.2. Results and Discussion  \n\n4.2.1. Correlation  \n\nIn order to evaluate the accuracy of the results obtained, the average relative deviations \n\n(ARD %) were calculated for each binary system as follows: \n\n???(%) =  \n1\n\n??\n?\n\n|??\n???? ??\n\n????|\n\n??\n???? ? 100   (24) \n\nwhere NP is the number of data points, and ??\n??? and  ??\n\n????  are the experimental and calculated \n\nsolubility in mole fraction, respectively.  \n\n The first optimization approach involved the application of Equation 15, using the values \n\nof the melting properties presented in Table 3.2. While performing the simulations, it wasn\u2019t \n\npossible to converge to a set of parameters that could correlate the data. This is probably due to \n\nthe high values found for the enthalpy of fusion, which may represent other phenomena instead \n\nof the melting point. Therefore, the Reference Solvent Approach was adopted as a second \n\nstrategy to describe the solid-liquid equilibria. \n\nFor this correlation step, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, 2-butanone, acetonitrile \n\nand ethyl acetate were selected. After, the parameters found were used to predict the solubility in \n\ndimethylformamide and isopropanol.  \n\nIn the gallic acid simulations, 2-butanone was discarded due to the decrease of the \n\nsolubility between 298.15 K and 313.15 K.  \n\nTable 4.1 shows the optimized segment parameters, the selected reference solvent, the \n\nnumber of solvents employed, the general ARD% and the system outlier for each solute studied \n\nin this work. More detailed information about the ARD% found per binary system as well as \n\npredicted solubility and activity coefficient data are shown in Table G.1 from Appendix G. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n40 \n\n \n\nTable 4.1: NRTL-SAC parameters, RSA, system Outlier, number of solvents and ARD (%) for each simulation. \n\nCompound X Y- Y+ Z RSA Outlier NS ARD (%) \n\nGallic Acid 0.496 0.430 0.000 2.290 Acetonitrile Ethyl Acetate 6 29 \n\nProtocatechuic Acid 0.579 1.080 0.000 0.726 Acetonitrile 2-Butanone 7 29 \n\nGentisic Acid 1.525 0.037 0.530 1.838 2-Propanol Water 7 25 \n\n?-Resorcylic Acid 0.188 0.139 0.000 1.044 Acetonitrile Ethyl Acetate 7 34 \n\n From all the solvents evaluated, acetonitrile was employed as the reference solvent three \n\ntimes, for gallic, protocatechuic and ?-resorcylic acids. For the simulations performed with \n\ngentisic acid, 2-propanol was the reference solvent that presented the minimum ARD.  \n\nThe correlation results lead to conclusion that NRTL-SAC is an adequate model to \n\nestimate solubility of the studied compounds, with minimum and maximum ARD values of 25 \n\nand 34 % for gentisic and ?-resorcylic acids, respectively.

However, the outlier \n\npresented a very high deviation of 95 %. \n\nFor the simulations performed with protocatechuic acid, 2-butanone was the outlier, with \n\n71% of maximum deviation. In this case, water and methanol presented the best calculated \n\nresults with 10% of ARD. \n\nThe simulations performed with gentisic acids exhibited peculiar results. In this case, all \n\nthe solubility data were adjusted very well in systems composed by organic solvents (all ARD \n\nwere inferior to 25%). However, the system presented a maximum deviation of 99.99 % for the \n\nsolubility calculated in aqueous system, predicting a value close to zero.  \n\nFor ?-resorcylic acid, ethyl acetate was the outlier, presenting a deviation of 80% and \n\nwater and 2-propanol were the solvents best fitted in terms of the calculated solubility, showing \n\neach an ARD of 11%.  \n\nThe predicted activity coefficients, shown in Table G.1, are higher than 1 for systems that \n\npresent low solubilities, such as those containing water, ethyl acetate and acetonitrile. For those \n\nsystems, the interactions between the solute and the solvent are weak, causing lower solubilities. \n\nOn the other hand, systems containing alcohols usually presented predicted activity coefficients \n\nlower than 1, which means in these systems, the solute-solvent interactions are strong provoking \n\nan increase in the solid solubility.  \n\n4.2.2. Prediction  \n\nOnce the NRTL-SAC segment parameters were obtained, the model can be used to \n\nestimate the solubility of the same solutes in different solvents.

More \n\ndetailed information is displayed in Table G.2 of Appendix G. Although Figure 4.5 shows that \n\nthe predicted solubility data were not as good as the calculated solubility data obtained in the \n\noptimizations of the NRTL-SAC parameters, Queimada et al. (2009) and Mota et al. (2010) also \n\npresented results containing ARD% higher than 70% for the predicted solubilities of binary \n\nsystems containing drug molecules, such as allopurinol, ibuprofen and estradiol. \n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n295 300 305 310 315\n\nS\no\n\nlu\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n i\n\nn\n m\n\no\nle\n\n f\nr\na\n\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \n\nTemperature (K) \n\na 1-Propanol Exp\n1-Propanol Calc\nDMF Exp\nDMF Calc\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n295 300 305 310 315\n\nS\no\n\nlu\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n i\n\nn\n m\n\no\nle\n\n f\nr\na\n\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \n\nTemperature (K) \n\nb 1-Propanol Exp\n1-Propanol Calc\n\nDMF Exp\n\nDMF Calc\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n295 300 305 310 315\n\nS\no\n\nlu\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n i\n\nn\n m\n\no\nle\n\n f\nr\na\n\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \n\nTemperature (K) \n\nc 1-Propanol Exp\n1-Propanol Calc\nDMF Exp\nDMF Calc\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n295 300 305 310 315\n\nS\no\n\nlu\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n i\n\nn\n m\n\no\nle\n\n f\nr\na\n\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n \n\nTemperature (K) \n\nd 1-Propanol Exp\n1-Propanol Calc\nDMF Exp\nDMF Calc\n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\nIn the case of the systems containing 1-propanol, there might have been some \n\noversaturation for gallic acid and ?-resorcylic acids (as mentioned before), which may be the \n\ncause of the high difference observed between the experimental and the estimated solubilities. In \n\nthe future, further experimental assays will be performed with this solvent to verify the \n\nexperimental values pointed in this work.  \n\nThe systems containing DMF presented very high experimental solubility values for all \n\nthe analyzed solutes.

X-ray analysis \n\nwill be performed in the future in order to characterize the solids. \n\nFinally, Figure 4.6 shows the big picture by presenting the calculated solubility using the \n\nNRTL-SAC model as a function of the experimental solubility data (the predicted solubility data \n\nfor the system formed by gentisic acid and water were disregarded due to their low log values). \n\nAll the solubility information used to plot the graphics in Figure 4.6 are displayed in Tables G.1 \n\nand G.2 of Appendix G. \n\n  \n\nFigure 4.6: Comparison between experimental and predicted solubility for solvents used in the determination of the \n\nNRTL-SAC segment descriptors (a) and other organic solvents (b). \n\n0.0001\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.0001 0.001 0.01 0.1 1\n\nlo\ng\n\n( \nC\n\na\nlc\n\nu\nla\n\nte\nd\n\n M\no\n\nle\n F\n\nr\na\n\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n S\no\n\nlu\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n) \n\nlog( Experimental Mole Fraction \n\nSolubility) \n\na \n\nWater\n\nMethanol\n\nEthanol\n\nIsopropanol\n\n2-Butanone\n\nEthyl Acetate\n\nAcetonitrile\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n0.001 0.01 0.1 1\n\nlo\ng\n\n( \nC\n\na\nlc\n\nu\nla\n\nte\nd\n\n M\no\n\nle\n F\n\nr\na\n\nc\nti\n\no\nn\n\n S\no\n\nlu\nb\n\nil\nit\n\ny\n) \n\nlog(Experimental Mole Fraction \n\nSolubility) \n\nb \n\n1-Propanol\n\nDMF\n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nAs can be seen in Figure 4.6, in general, the calculated solubilities that presented the \n\nhighest deviations were inferior to the experimental solubility data. From the seven binary \n\nsystems employed to optimize the NRTL-SAC parameters for the studied solutes, those \n\ncontaining ethyl acetate and 2-butanone are the more difficult to be correlated. Furthermore, \n\npredicted solubilities values for binary systems containing 1-propanol usually have lower \n\ndeviations than binary systems containing dimethylformamide.  \n\nAs shown in Table G.2 from Appendix G, almost all the systems containing 1-propanol \n\nand DMF presented estimated activity coefficients lower than 1 (the only exception was for the \n\nbinary system formed by ?-resorcylic acid and 1-propanol). Due to the high experimental \n\nsolubility presented by those systems, the interactions between the studied phenolic acids and the \n\nmentioned solvents are strong, causing the activity coefficients to be lower than 1.  \n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\nChapter 5 Conclusions and Future Work \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n In this work, the solubility of gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, gentisic acid and ?-\n\nresorcylic acid was experimentally measured in water and different organic solvents (methanol, \n\nethanol, 1-propanol, isopropanol, 2-butanone, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile and \n\ndimethylformamide), at 298.2 and 313.2 K. The shake-flask methodology was applied using the \n\ngravimetric method as analysis method with good results. In general, an increase in the \n\ntemperature indicates an increment in the solubility of the binary systems. \n\nThe coefficients of variation of all the experimental assays were lower than 2%, which \n\nare very acceptable. The solubility data generally exhibited the same pattern for alcohols, \n\npresenting the highest solubilities for those having the shortest carbon chain. An exception \n\noccurred for the system composed by ?-resorcylic acid and 1-propanol, for which the solubility \n\nvalues were much higher than those obtained for binary systems containing ethanol and \n\nisopropanol. Further experiments should be performed in the future to corroborate the values \n\nobtained in this work.  \n\nMelting points and enthalpies of fusion were also determined by Differential Scanning \n\nCalorimetry (DSC) for the phenolic compounds addressed in this work. The results for the \n\nmelting temperature were consistent with literature values. Regarding the melting enthalpy, a \n\nhigh uncertainty is associated with the measured values as solid phase transitions or sublimation \n\nphenomena may interfere with the values obtained. .  \n\nThe second part of this work consisted in the thermodynamic modelling of the \n\nexperimental data measured in this work by applying the Non-Random Two Liquid Segment \n\nActivity Coefficient (NRTL-SAC) model. NRTL-SAC was selected because this framework has \n\nshown great robustness and accuracy to predict the solid-liquid equilibria of a wide range of \n\nsystems. In this work, the model presented acceptable correlation results with average relative \n\ndeviation (ARD) varying between 25 and 34%. After, the model was used to predict the \n\nsolubility in 1-propanol and dimethylformamide and the ARD% were 70 and 78%, respectively. \n\n\n\n47 \n\n \n\nThose values are satisfactory for semi-predictive models, using a limited set of solvents. From \n\nthe solvents employed in the simulations, the solubility in alcohols and acetonitrile was better \n\ncorrelated by the model, presenting the lowest ARD values.  \n\nConsidering that no previous simulations were reported until this moment for the studied \n\nphenolic acids, the NRTL-SAC segment descriptors can contribute for future predictions in \n\ndifferent systems. For future work, further experimental solubility measurements in different \n\nbinary and multicomponent systems are suggested, in order to provide more robustness to the \n\noptimized parameters. In addition, other thermodynamic frameworks, such as UNIFAC, \n\nUNIQUAC and their variations could also be implemented.  \n\nIn order to better understand the solubility behavior of those phenolic acids in water and \n\norganic solvents, measurements of the potential of hydrogen (pH) can be performed in the future, \n\nas well as solid-phase characterizations. By knowing more detailed about the solid-solid \n\ntransactions, a better understating of the solubility behavior of the studied compounds could be \n\naccomplished. In addition, studies on the solubility of other phenolic acids can also be performed \n\nto aid in the understanding of molecular structure\u2019s influence in the solubility of those \n\ncompounds. \n\n  \n\n\n\n48 \n\n \n\nBibliographic References \n\nAbildskov, J. &amp; O\u2019Connell, J.P., 2003.
