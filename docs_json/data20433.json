Precipitation in the study area is highly seasonal with about five nearly rainless months during which\nD is two fold higher compared to wet season values. As a consequence of the seasonal fluctuations in rainfall and D, soil water\npotential changes substantially in the upper 100 cm of soil, but remains nearly constant below 2 m depth. Hydraulic\narchitecture and water relations traits of Cerrado trees adjusted during the dry season to prevent increasing water deficits and\ninsure homeostasis in minimum leaf water potential ?L and in total daily water loss per plant (isohydry). The isohydric\nbehavior of Cerrado trees was the result of a decrease in total leaf surface area per tree, a strong stomatal control of\nevaporative losses, an increase in leaf-specific hydraulic conductivity and leaf hydraulic conductance and an increase in the\namount of water withdrawn from internal stem storage, during the dry season. Water transport efficiency increased in the same\nproportion in leaves and terminal stems during the dry season. All of these seasonal adjustments were important for\nmaintaining ?L above critical thresholds, which  reduces the rate of embolism formation in stems and help to avoid turgor loss\nin leaf tissues still during the dry season. These adjustments allow the stems of most Cerrado woody species to operate far\nfrom the point of catastrophic dysfunction for cavitation, while leaves operate close to it and experience embolism on a daily\nbasis, especially during the dry season.          .................................................................................................................................\nKey words: isohydric behavior, hydraulic conductivity, soil water potential and water content, savanna, stomatal\nconductance, transpiration\n\nRela\u00e7\u00f5es h\u00eddricas e arquitetura hidr\u00e1ulica em \u00e1rvores do cerrado: adequa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s varia\u00e7\u00f5es sazonais de disponibilidade\nh\u00eddrica e de demanda evaporativa: O objetivo deste estudo foi determinar os ajustamentos na morfologia e fisiologia que\npermitem \u00e1rvores das savanas neotropicais do Brasil Central (Cerrado) de evitar d\u00e9ficits h\u00eddricos e de manter um balan\u00e7o\nh\u00eddrico interno praticamente constante apesar das varia\u00e7\u00f5es sazonais da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o e no d\u00e9ficit de satura\u00e7\u00e3o do ar (D).\nA precipita\u00e7\u00e3o na \u00e1rea de estudo \u00e9 fortemente sazonal, com cerca de cinco meses praticamente sem chuva durante os\nquais D \u00e9 duas vezes maior aos valores medidos na \u00e9poca chuvosa.

Their seasonal growth rates are well coupled to the\nseasonal changes in the availability of the main limiting\nresource: water. In contrast, physiological activity and\ngrowth rates of savanna trees are uncoupled from\nseasonal changes in precipitation (Gouveia, 1998;\nMeinzer et al., 1999; Prado et al., 2004; Simioni et al., 2004;\nDamascos et al., 2005; Bucci et al., 2005; Franco et al.,\n2005; Hoffmann et al., 2005), even though the seasonal\npattern of precipitation is similar to that of dry forests.\nIndeed, seasonally deciduous or semideciduous forests\noccur throughout the savanna region in Central Brazil on\nrich Ca and Mg soils (Ratter et al., 1978).\n\nThe climate of savanna ecosystems of Central Brazil\n(Cerrado) is characterized by five months with very few\nrainfall events and a long period with high precipitations.\nEvaporative demand is substantially higher during the\n\ndry season (May to September) because of lower ambient\nrelative humidity. The combination of higher evaporative\ndemand and low precipitation during the dry season\nmakes the Cerrado a potentially stressful environment for\nvascular plants. Despite stressful conditions during the\nrainless season, many tree species maintain an active\ncrop of leaves during this period and new leaves are\nproduced before the beginning of the wet season (Franco\net al., 2005; Lenza and Klink, 2006). Stem growth rates\nincrease after the first large rainfall pulses of the wet\nseason and high growth rates are maintained until two to\nthree months before the end of the wet season in early\nM a r c h  ( S a r a c e n o ,  2 0 0 6 ) .  I t  i s  l i k e l y  t h a t  p h o t o -\nassimilates, at this point in time, are channeled to\nenhance root growth, instead of stem growth, to insure\nwater uptake during the dry season. The production of\nnew leaves by savanna trees during the most unfavorable\nperiod for growth may be an adaptive response to the low\nnutrient availability in the soil (Sarmiento et al., 1985).\nThe presence of completely expanded leaves before the\nfirst rainfall events can help to reduce nutrient leaching\nf r o m  l e a v e s  b e c a u s e  t h e i r  c u t i c l e  w o u l d  b e  f u l l y\ndeveloped, making them less leachable compared to\nexpanding leaves. Minimizing nutrient losses and at the\nsame time decreasing leaf losses to herbivores, which are\nless active at the end of the dry season (Marquis et al.,\n2002), is advantageous in terms of nutrient and carbon\nbalance. Nevertheless, maintaining leaves as well as\nproducing new leaves during the dry season incurs a\ncarbon cost for savanna trees. They have to cope with\n\n\n\n235\n\nBraz. J. Plant Physiol., 20(3):233-245, 2008\n\nHYDRAULIC ARCHITECTURE AND WATER RELATIONS OF CERRADO TREES\n\nthe higher cost of maintaining long and deep roots to tap\nwater from abundant and more stable water sources\navailable at depth (Scholz et al., 2008a). Even though\nmost Cerrado trees have more than 50% of their biomass\nbelowground (Sarmiento, 1983; Castro and Kauffman,\n1998), some Cerrado woody species have relatively\nshallow root systems (Scholz et al., 2008a).\n\nTo avoid losing leaves during the unfavorable growth\nperiod, species from other seasonal ecosystems undergo\nosmotic adjustment in their photosynthetic and other\nmetabolically active tissues to avoid losing cell turgor\nwhen water is depleted in the soil and plant water\npotential becomes more negative. Other changes in leaf-\nwater relations characteristics may include a decrease in\nthe modulus of elasticity (Turner and Jones, 1980).\nHowever, if woody Cerrado species are isohydric\n(Franco, 1998; Meinzer et al., 1999; Prado et al., 2004;\nBucci et al., 2005), then osmotic adjustment or any other\nchange in pressure volume relationships in leaves during\nthe dry season may not be needed. Different types of\nphysiological and morphological adjustments that allow\nthe trees to maintain leaf water potentials (?L) above the\nturgor loss point during the dry season are possible. The\nfirst objective of this study was to asses if dominant\nCerrado woody species are isohydric, meaning that they\nmaintain similar minimum ?L throughout the year\n(Tardieu and Simonneau, 1998). The term isohydry is\nused interchangeably with homeostasis in minimum ?L in\nthis study. The second objective was to discuss the\nc u r r e n t  k n o w l e d g e  a n d  n e w  d a t a  c o n c e r n i n g\nphysiological and morphological adjustments which\nfavor the water balance of Cerrado woody species during\nthe dry season. The third objective was to assess the\ndegree of coordination between stem and leaf hydraulics\nto help identify additional mechanisms governing the\nregulation of internal water balance of savanna trees.\n\nMATERIAL  AND METHODS\n\nStudy site and plant material: The study was conducted\nin savanna sites with intermediate tree density (cerrado\nsensu stricto) at the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e\nEstat\u00edstica (IBGE) Ecological Reserve, a field experimental\nstation located 33 km south of Brasilia (15o 56\u2019S, 47o 53\u2019W,\naltitude 1100 m). Annual precipitation in the reserve\nranges from 880 to 2150 mm depending on the year with a\n\nmean of approximately 1500 mm (www.recor.org.br). There is\na pronounced dry season from May through September\nwith the months of June, July and August being nearly\nrainless. Mean monthly temperature ranges from 19 to 23 oC\nwith diurnal temperature variations of 20 oC being common\nduring the dry season. The soils are deep oxisols containing\nabout 70% clay. The development of micro aggregate\nstructures (e.g. cementation by iron oxides) allows Cerrado\nsoils to be generally porous and well drained despite their\nhigh clay content (Furley and Ratter, 1988).\n\nAn extensive data set collected over 10 years (1996 to\n2006) from 12 dominant woody species ranging from\nevergreen to brevideciduous and deciduous (Meinzer et\nal., 1999; Bucci et al., 2004a,b; Bucci et al., 2005; Bucci et al.,\n2006; Scholz et al., 2006; Scholz et al., 2007; Bucci et al.,\n2008; Goldstein et al., 2008; Hao et al., 2008; Scholz et al.,\n2008a,b) was used in this study in addition to previously\nunpublished data. The species studied, their family, leaf\nphenology and measured morphological and physiological\nvariables in each species are listed in Table 1.\n\nSoil water potential and volumetric water content: Soil\nwater potential was measured using soil psychrometers\n(PST-55, Wescor, Logan, UT) which were deployed at\n0.20, 0.30, 0.60 and 1.00 m below the soil surface. The\npsychrometers were connected to a data logger (CR-7,\nCampbell Scientific, Logan, Utah, USA). Soil volumetric\nwater content was measured with highly sensitive probes\ncontaining eight annular capacitance sensors (Sentek\nPTY LTD, Adelaide, Australia) positioned at several\ndepths down to 250 cm. Technical details for both\nmethods are described in Bucci et al. (2008).\n\nLeaf area index: Leaf area index of woody species was\nestimated with a LAI 2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (LI-\nCOR Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) during wet (October,\nFebruary and April) and dry (May, June and August)\nseasons as described previously (Hoffmann et al., 2005;\nBucci et al., 2008).\n\nSapwood and leaf water potential, and turgor loss\npoint: Sapwood water potential (?_sw) was measured in\none representative tree per species during the dry season\nwith in situ stem psychrometers (Plant Water Status\nInstruments, Guelph, Ontario, Canada) and recorded with\na datalogger (CR-7, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA)\nat 10-min intervals as described in Scholz et al. (2007).\n\n\n\n236\n\nBraz. J. Plant Physiol., 20(3):233-245, 2008\n\nS. J. BUCCI et al.\n\nMinimum leaf water potential (?L) was measured with a\npressure chamber (PMS Instruments, Corvallis OR, USA)\ni n  t h r e e  e x p o s e d  l e a v e s  o n  e a c h  o f  t h r e e  t o  f i v e\nindividuals per species during the dry season (August-\nSetember) and wet season (February-March). The bulk\nleaf turgor loss point (?0) was determined from pressure-\nvolume relationships (Tyree and Hammel, 1972) for three,\nfully developed exposed leaves from three individuals per\nspecies during the dry and wet seasons.\n\nR o o t  a n d  l e a f  h y d r a u l i c  p r o p e r t i e s  a n d  s t o m a t a l\nconductance: Total hydraulic conductivity (Lp) was\nmeasured in roots of B. crassa, B. salicifolius, K.\ncoriaceae and Q. parviflora collected between 0530 and\n0700 h in January (wet season) and August (dry season)\nas described in Scholz et al., (2008a).The Lp (m s-1 MPa-1)\nwas calculated as Lp = (?Qv/?P)(1/A) where Qv (m\n\n3 s-1) is\nvolumetric flow rate, P (MPa) is the pressure applied, and\nA (m2) is the lateral surface area of the root segment\n(Nobel, Schulte and North, 1990).\n\nLeaf-specific hydraulic conductivity (KL; kg m\n-1 s-1\n\nMPa-1) was measured in three branches excised before\ndawn from three to five individuals per species during dry\nand wet seasons according to Bucci et al., (2004a) and\nBucci et al., (2006). Branches were immediately re-cut\nunder water and attached to a hydraulic conductivity\napparatus (Tyree and Sperry, 1989). Leaf-specific\nconductivity was calculated as the mass flow rate divided\nby the pressure gradient across the branch segment and\nnormalized by the total leaf area distal to the stem. Stem\nvulnerability curves, to estimate the pressure at 50\npercent of loss conductivity (P50stem), were determined by\nmeasuring percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity due\nto embolism over a range of water potential reached\nduring dehydration by the bench drying method (Sperry\net al., 1988). Details about stem vulnerability curves are\ndescribed in Bucci et al., (2006) and Hao et al., (2008).\n\nLeaf hydraulic vulnerability curves were determined\nmeasuring leaf hydraulic conductance (KLeaf) following\nthe partial rehydration method described by Brodribb and\nHolbrook, (2003). Three leaves of five different trees per\nspecies were used to measure KLeaf and to estimate the\n\nTable 1.

New, fully expanded leaves from sun-exposed\nareas of the crown were used for measurements.\n\nTr a n s p i r a t i o n  a n d  s t e m  w a t e r  s t o r a g e :   T h e  h e a t\ndissipation method (Granier, 1985, 1987) was used to\nmeasure the mass flow of water in ten out of the 12\nspecies (three to five individuals per species) during two\nto five consecutive days at the end of the dry season\n(August and September) and at the peak of the wet\nseason (January and February). Transpiration per unit\nleaf area (E) was obtained by dividing the mass flow of\nsap measured near the base of the main stem of each tree\nby the total leaf area per plant according to Meinzer et al.,\n(1999) and Bucci et al., (2005). Total leaf area per plant was\nobtained by multiplying the number of leaves per plant by\nthe average projected area per leaf, determined from a\nsub-sample of 10-50 leaves per plant.\n\nTo determine daily utilization of stored water for\ntranspiration, sap flow was measured simultaneously in\nterminal branches and near the base of the main stem in\nsix of study species as described in Scholz et al., (2008b).\nStem water storage (ws) calculations were based on the\nmethod described by Goldstein et al., (1998).\n\nRESULTS\nPrecipitation in the study area is highly seasonal with\n\na b o u t  f i v e  n e a r l y  r a i n l e s s  m o n t h s  ( M a y  t h r o u g h\nSeptember, Figure 1). Mean daily air saturation deficit (D)\nis twice as great toward the end of the dry season\ncompared to wet season values. As a consequence of the\nseasonal fluctuations in precipitation and D, soil water\npotential fluctuated substantially in the upper 100 cm of\nsoil. Average soil water potential, between 20 and 100 cm\ndepth, ranged from 0 MPa in the rainy season to about -\n2.0 MPa near the end of the dry season (Figure 2a). Soil\nwater storage (the total amount of water in the upper 250\ncm of the soil profile excluding the first 10 cm) also\n\nchanged seasonally. It decreased from about 400 mm in\nthe wet season to about 230 mm at the peak of the dry\nseason (Figure 2b).  This would imply that the vegetation\nhad used about 170 mm of water up to the peak of the dry\nseason if one assumes that the period was rainless, and\nthat there was neither lateral flow nor deep percolation.\nTree and shrub leaf area index responded to changes in\nsoil water availability decreasing from 1.4 m2 m-2 in the wet\nseason to about 1 m2 m-2 at the peak of the dry season.\n\nSeveral scaling relationships between leaf functional\ntraits or between leaf traits and branch architectural traits\nacross species were identified. In some cases only one\nmathematical function was enough to describe scaling\nrelationships for both wet and dry season data, and in\nother cases two functions were used to describe dry and\nw e t  s e a s o n  r e l a t i o n s h i p s .

The line is the exponential decay\nfunction fitted to the data (y = 3.87 * 18.7 (exp (-30.8x)); P\n&lt;0.0001).\n\nBrazilian Cerrado is influenced by the seasonal pattern of\nprecipitation and by the plastic responses of root growth\nand physiology to variation in belowground resources.\nDespite a 4- to 5-month dry season, the presence of\nabundant moisture at depths below 2 m (Quesada et al.,\n2 0 0 4 ,  2 0 0 8 )  s u g g e s t s  t h a t  m u c h  o f  t h e  a n n u a l\nprecipitation remains unexploited by the deep roots of\nwoody plants. Seasonal variations in water availability\nacross the soil profile result in different patterns of water\nuptake by woody plants, which differ depending on their\nleaf phenology (deciduous, brevideciduous, evergreen)\nand root architecture (monomorphic in evergreen species\nand dimorphic in brevideciduous and deciduous species)\n(Scholz et al., 2008a). Adequate water supply appears to\nbe a prerequisite for the species to maintain similar\nmidday minimum leaf water potentials in both seasons.\nConsistent with the isohydric behavior of Cerrado tree\nspecies, osmotic adjustment in the leaves did not occur:\nthe osmotic potential at zero turgor remained unchanged\n\nenvironmental conditions (e.g. Larcher, 1980; Frank et al.,\n2007). Isohydry is generally attributed to strong stomatal\ncontrol of transpiration which results in similar midday\n?L regardless of soil moisture and D (Frank et al., 2007).\nStomatal conductance of anysohydric plants, on the\nother hand, is less responsive to variations in D and soil\nmoisture, allowing large seasonal fluctuations in tissue\nwater potentials. A third mode of behavior was recently\nsuggested by Frank and coworkers, (2007) in which soil-\nto-leaf water potentials are maintained seasonally\nconstant but ?L fluctuates in synchrony with seasonal\nv a r i a t i o n s  i n  s o i l  w a t e r  a v a i l a b i l i t y.  M o s t  o f  t h e\nmechanisms used to explain isohydric behavior are based\non stomatal sensitivity to changes in atmospheric or soil\nmoisture. However there are several other potential\nmechanisms that can help in maintaining seasonal\nconstancy of plant water status, including the utilization\nof internal water reservoirs, changes in the total amount\nof gas exchange surface per plant, changes in the\npatterns of water uptake, and variations in the hydraulic\narchitecture of plants.\n\nVariation in soil water availability with depth in the\n\n\n\n241\n\nBraz.

The contribution of superficial roots\nto the water economy of the trees during the dry season\nwas very small because of limited soil water availability in\nthe upper soil layers and also because of seasonal\nincreases in hydraulic resistance of shallow roots (Domec\net al., 2006; Scholz et al., 2008a). The occurrence of\nhydraulic lift in several Cerrado woody species (Scholz et\n\nFigure 8.

Each point is the mean value \u00b1\nSE of three to five individuals per species for KL and five\nindividuals per species for KLeaf.\n\nal., 2002; Moreira et al., 2003; Meinzer et al., 2004; Scholz\net al., 2008a) partially mitigates but is not sufficient to\nprevent a substantial loss of Lp in shallow roots during\nthe dry season (Figure 8b). Avoiding complete root\nrectification sensu Nobel and Sanderson (1984) may be\nuseful for maintaining arbuscular mycorrhiza and\nnitrogen fixing bacteria inside the roots alive.\n\nAt the whole-plant level, total daily water loss was\nsimilar during the dry season compared to the wet season\n(Bucci et al., 2005). The large impact of a two-fold\nincrease in D would have had on transpiration during the\ndry season was partially compensated by a decrease in\nstomatal conductance. Strong stomatal limitation to\ntranspiration in response to increases in D was not\nsufficient to prevent transpiration per unit leaf surface\narea from increasing during the dry season.

An additional\nmechanism contributing to the seasonal homeostasis was\nthe increase in the amount of water withdrawn from the\nstem storages during the daytime. Utilization of water\nstored in stems increased by 10 % during the dry season\ncompared to the wet season (Figure 5).\n\nLeaves constitute an important hydraulic bottleneck in\nthe water transport pathway of plants, representing more\nthan 30% of whole plant resistance in the root to leaf\ncontinuum (Brodribb et al., 2002; Sack et al., 2003). Leaves of\nCerrado woody plants appear to be more vulnerable to\nembolism than their terminal stems to which they are\nattached (Table 2 and Hao et al., 2008). Stem xylem in Cerrado\nspecies operates far from the point of catastrophic\ndysfunction sensu Tyree and Sperry (1988), while leaves\noperate at substantially more negative leaf water potentials.\nCavitation commonly occurs in leaves (e.g. Canny, 2001;\nLoGullo et al., 2003; Woodruff et al., 2007). Embolism repair\ninvolving the occurrence of transient pressure changes\nresulting from diurnal variations in the amount of\nosmotically active solutes inside cells surrounding leaf\nvascular bundles, has been documented for petioles of\nCerrado trees (Bucci et al., 2003). On the other hand,\nembolism formation and refilling is probably of limited\nsignificance for Cerrado woody plant stems. Compared to\nstems, diurnal refilling in leaves may be less energetically\ncostly and may involve simpler mechanisms (Bucci et al.,\n2003; Brodribb and Holbrook, 2004). Consequently, a large\nsafety margin between minimum ? and P50\u00b4s, will be required\nfor stems to avoid the need of embolism repair in xylem\nconduits. On the other hand, from an adaptive point of view,\n\nembolism formation and repair in the leaf lamina may be a\nmeans of amplifying the evaporative demand signal to the\nstomata in order to expedite a stomatal response (Brodribb\nand Holbrook, 2004).\n\nLeaf hydraulic conductance and KL, estimates of leaf\nand stem water transport efficiency, respectively,\nincrease in a coordinated manner during the dry season.\nHydraulic efficiency increases in the same proportion in\nstem and leaves, from the wet to dry seasons (Figure 9).\nThis hydraulic adjustment of stems and leaves during the\nleast favorable period for metabolic and physiological\nactivities in Cerrado plants should improve the delivery\nof water to the leaf cells and may contribute to insure the\nisohydric behavior of Cerrado trees. Increases in water\ntransport efficiency of stems can be, at least partially,\nexplained by a reduction in the leaf surface distal to\nterminal stem segments during the dry season. The\nmechanisms that could explain the enhancement of leaf\nhydraulic conductance during the dry season is not\nk n o w n ,  h o w e v e r  t h e  o n t o g e n e t i c  s t a g e  i n  l e a f\ndevelopment (e.g. newly expanding and fully mature\nleaves) may have an influence on the movement of water\nwithin leaves (Brodribb and Holbrook, 2005).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAdjustments in hydraulic architecture and water relations\ntraits of Cerrado trees during the dry season prevented\nincreased water deficits and insured homeostasis in\nminimum ?L and total daily water loss per plant. The\nisohydric behavior of Cerrado trees was the result of\nstrong stomatal control of evaporative losses, a decrease\n\nTable 2.
