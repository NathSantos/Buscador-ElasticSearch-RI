In this context, the following characterizations were \n\ncarried out: viscosity determinations for obtaining stable/ homogenous \n\nslurry with desired viscosity; thermal treatment set points \n\ndeterminations, which involve thermogravimetric analyses and \n\ndifferential thermal analyses; morphology characterization of the \n\nproduced oxide porous ceramic matrix. Due to the fact that the \n\nproduction route is related to reaction bonding then oxidation kinetics \n\nparameters were also determined. An oxide-based process was \n\ndeveloped, wherein a final oxide phase is produced through the indirect \n\noxidation of an intermediate phase, which is formed from metallic \n\npowder. The main results found were: porosity within the expected \n\nvalues, i.e. ~50%; Weibull parameter of 10.54, ?0 of 14.15 MPa with \n\n?max of 16.1 MPa; Activation energy of oxidation of the isolated \n\naluminum carbide of 129.65 kJ/mol at lower temperatures and of 16.91 \n\nkJ/mol at higher temperatures. \n\n \n\n \n\nKeywords: Reaction Bonding.

For instance, \n\ncomposites can bear moderate loads at high temperatures, i.e. 1200\u00b0C \n\n(CHAWLA, 1993), and at room temperature they may present damage \n\ntolerance characteristics. They have a potential for saving energy, \n\nreducing wear, and increasing the lifetime of components (JANSSEN, et \n\nal., 2008). Conversely, regardless of their excellent properties, structural \nceramics are not as widely used in industry as they should and could be. \n\nAmong the reasons for the reluctance of industry to introduce structural \n\nceramic as components are (JANSSEN, et al., 2008): \n\n? high price of ceramic parts,  \n\n? insufficient knowledge in \u201ctraditional\u201d metal-oriented \nengineering,  \n\n? low toughness,  \n\n? need to redesign components to meet specific ceramic \nrequirements. \n\nThere are a number of examples where components based on ceramic \n\ncomposites have been designed and tested successfully, but, despite their \n\nsuperior properties, they have not been put into production, basically due \n\nto their high price. In some cases machining costs can account for 80% \n\nof the overall manufacturing costs of a ceramic component. (KLOCKE, \n\n1997)  \n\nChallenging approaches are provided by synthesis routes which exhibit \n\nreduced shrinkage, and capabilities for shaping by machining in the \n\ngreen state. In this case, reactive processing routes like reaction bonding \n\nof aluminium oxide (RBAO), sintered alumina aluminide alloys (3A) are \n\ngood examples. These techniques have been developed at Advanced \n\nCeramics Institute of the Technological University of Hamburg-Harburg \n\n(TUHH - Technische Universit\u00e4t Hamburg-Harburg) (CLAUSSEN, et \n\nal., 1990), (CLAUSSEN and WU, 1992), (WU, et al., 1993), \n\n(CLAUSSEN, et al., 1996), (JANSSEN, et al., 2002),(JANSSEN, et al., \n\n2008). \n\nFibre reinforcement of ceramics is a concept which has attracted a lot of \n\ninterest, especially in the automotive and aerospace industry. The \n\nessential requirements for fibre reinforced ceramic matrix composites \n\n(FRCMC) are high temperature stability, oxidation resistance and \n\ndamage tolerance (JANSSEN, et al., 2008). For non-oxide matrices, \nreinforcement is especially performed with long-fibre (Cf-SiC) \n\n\n\n2 \n\n \n\ncomposites with suitable rupture behaviour (JANSSEN, 2007). At high \n\ntemperature and long time applications (i.e. burners, turbine \n\ncomponents, structural insulations, etc.) the stability of those materials in \n\noxygen atmosphere is still a feature that limit their broader application.  \n\nIn the last few years, researches concentrated on complex coatings for \n\noxidation protection of the components (internal) or of the entire \n\nprefabricated part (external), for use in oxygen rich atmospheres, such as \n\nfor combustion processes. At present, it is not yet unequivocally clarified \n\nwhether a damage tolerant fibre composite can actually be produced \n\nwith these concepts. Therefore, most commercial applications of carbon \n\nfibre reinforced silicon carbide (Cf-SiC) are focused yet on systems \n\nwhere the average service temperature in air is quite moderate (i.e. brake \n\ndisc rotors in advanced sport cars). Oxide-Oxide FRCMCs are therefore \n\nan attractive alternative.  \n\nPolycrystalline oxide fibres although are still limited in maximum \n\nservice temperature when compared to carbon or (very expensive) \n\nsilicon carbide fibres like High Nicalon. Therefore, research on these \n\ncomposites has been running for more than a decade (EVANS and ZOK, \n\n1994). The production problems are yet not solved and only some oxide-\n\noxide FRCMCs are produced in lab in a very small scale \n\n(WESTWOOD, et al., 1996). This work will focus, therefore, on the \n\ndevelopment of a novel route for porous ceramic matrix production by \n\ncombining features of proven effective techniques. \n\n \n\n1.1 MOTIVATION \n\nThe motivation of this research project was the opportunity of combine \n\nfeatures of two proven techniques for develop and adapt a novel route \n\nfor production of porous ceramic materials. Particularly in this study the \n\nnovel route was adapted for producing porous matrix material for \n\ncomposites, although the technique may be directed for some other \n\napplications. This work concerned in ensuring the successful \n\ndevelopment of the production steps for obtaining desired phases \n\nthrough within the processing cycles. \n\n \n\n1.2 OBJECTIVES \n\nThe prime objective of this work is to develop a porous ceramic material \n\nto be used as porous ceramic matrix. This matrix has to present stable \n\nporosity and a specific microstructure to enable damage tolerant \n\nbehaviour and also has to exhibit a desirable mechanical behaviour at \n\nhigh temperatures.  \n\n\n\n3 \n\nThe following specific objectives are to be achieved: \n\n? Development of a method for obtaining a ceramic matrix, in \nwhich a controlled porosity and a tailored microstructure are \n\ngenerated consisting on mullite particles surrounded by finer \n\nalumina particles. The desired porosity ranges from 20% to \n\n50%. The desired mullite particle size ranges from 5 to 15 \u00b5m \n\nand the alumina particles are expected to be a finer particulate \n\ndispersed around the mullite particles. \n\n? Definition of viscosity properties of the slurry to be used in the \ncomposite panel infiltration process; \n\n? Definition of the setup of production route for \nreaction/oxidation/sintering thermal treatment; \n\n? Evaluation of mechanical properties of the produced matrix by \nWeibull statics. \n\n? Characterization of the matrix morphology in order to determine \nhow particles of alumina are distributed within the matrix \n\nmaterial. \n\n? Determination of oxidation kinetics of the intermediate phase, \ni.e. activation energy of oxidation. \n\n  \n\n\n\n4 \n\n \n\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW \n\nReaction-bonding as well as ceramic composites fabrication techniques \n\nwill be reviewed in this chapter. \n\n \n\n2.1 REACTION BONDING TECHNIQUES \n\nCeramics are well known as brittle materials. Fracture toughness of most \n\nceramics does not exceed values of 10 MPa  . However, the \napplication of sophisticated processing techniques, limiting typical flaw \n\nsizes, reducing heterogeneities to a micrometre scale, enables attainment \n\nof flexural strength up to a GPa range. According to Knechtel and co-\n\nwokers, the reliability of structural ceramics can be controlled by at least \n\nfour mechanisms with dissimilar degrees of efficiency, e.g. distribution \n\nof defect size, R-curve effects, stress induced plasticity and reduced flaw \n\nsize (KNECHTEL, et al., 1995). Those controlling parameters are within \n\nreaction bonding techniques, which may produce very clear grain \n\nboundaries, with very fine dispersed grains. \n\nThe characteristic feature of reaction bonding techniques is the involved \n\nreaction, which occurs during the heat treatment schedule. Reaction-\n\nBonded Aluminium Oxide (RBAO) and Reaction-Bonded Mullite \n\n(RBM) are examples of such techniques. The properties and processing \n\nof reaction-bonded ceramics are presented in the literature (CLAUSSEN \n\nand WU, 1992). RBAO and RBM compacts exhibit low shrinkage, and \n\nvery distinctive mechanical properties due to their microstructure \n\nmorphology. Reaction Bonding techniques can be modified to produce \n\nzirconia\u2013toughened RBAO, for instance, among other composite \n\nceramics. Nevertheless, the RB processes exhibit different fundaments \n\nand features in comparison with directed metal oxidation (CLAUSSEN \n\nand WU, 1992). While conventional sintered products present a \n\nshrinkage range from 15 to 20%, the RB techniques exhibit nearly zero \n\nshrinkage, which makes them suitable for application where near net \n\nshape plays an important role. The almost zero shrinkage feature comes \n\nfrom the expansion associated with the oxidation of the raw-materials, \n\nwherein metallic particles amounts of up to 60 vol.% are combined with \n\nthe other raw materials. Some additives are employed so that the kinetics \n\nof oxidation is modified in order to ease the process. Those metallic \n\nparticles may easily oxidize during milling, which may be avoided in a \n\nclosed milling system. The same approach is applied to mechanical \n\nalloying of intermetallics, i.e. attrition milling. The milled powder is \n\nthen dried and pressed, which cause the Al and Al2O3 particles to form \n\n\n\n5 \n\ncontacts by bridging. This is the reason why those compacts can present \n\nhigh green strength, e.g. 20-50 MPa, which are values far higher than \n\nthose of conventional ceramic green bodies. In heating treatment, the \n\ncompacts undergo not only sintering mechanisms, but also solid state \n\noxidation, which balances and hinders compact shrinkage. In RB \n\ntechniques where the near net shape is not a highlighted property, the \n\nshrinkage can reach at most 5%.  \n\nCompletely reaction-bonded bodies usually exhibit 3 to 8% \n\nhomogeneously distributed micropores with sizes lower than 1 ?m. \n\nThose compacts can exhibit mechanical strength up to 500 MPa, 94.5% \n\ntheoretical density and may present up to 20 vol.% ZrO2 as reinforcing \n\nphase.  \n\nAs previously mentioned, RB techniques can be modified in various way \n\nby either metal, e.g. Zr, Cr, Si etc, or ceramic additives, e.g. ZrO2, \n\nCr2O3, MgO, SiC etc. Depending on the selected modification the RB \n\ncompact can either present a low shrinkage, e.g. RBAO or Zirconia-\n\nToughened Alumina; a near net shape, e.g. Reaction Bonded \n\nAluminium/Chromium Oxide; or even a slightly expansion, e.g. RBM \n\n(CLAUSSEN and WU, 1992). \n\n \n\n \n\n2.1.1 RBAO technique \n\nAuthors in literature (CLAUSSEN, et al., 1989) addressed the \n\nfabrication of reaction-bonded alumina with near zero shrinkages (<1%). \n\nIn this case, the samples of attrition-milled Al/Al2O3 powder mixtures \n\nare heat treated at temperatures between 1200 and 1550\u00b0C, so that the \n\nexpansion due to the Al ? Al2O3 reaction and the sintering shrinkage of \n\nAl2O3 are nearly balanced. Those authors also addressed a shrinkage of \n\n~14% for samples made out of 100% Al2O3, regarding the same powder \n\nparticles distribution and heat treatment schedule. \n\nLater on (WU and CLAUSSEN, 1990) a reduction of mullite-zirconia \n\nceramics was proposed by combining the RBAO reaction with the \n\nreaction of zircon (ZrSiO4) with Al2O3adding metallic aluminium \n\npowder to the mixture. Although the produced compacts presented lower \n\nshrinkage, they showed higher porosity and lower toughness mechanical \n\nstrength. The final properties were 350 MPa strength, 4.5 MPa   \ntoughness and 13.5% porosity. On the other hand, modified samples \n\npresented 250 MPa, 2.5 MPa   and 5.5%, of strength, toughness and \nporosity, respectively. \n\n\n\n6 \n\n \n\nTailoring of reaction-bonded Al2O3 ceramics is reported in the literature \n\n(CLAUSSEN, et al., 1990). Authors discussed possible mechanisms of \n\nmicrostructural development and of composite formation. Attrition \n\nmilled Al/Al2O3 compacts with 50% and 35 vol.% of Al were heat \n\ntreated and yielded theoretical density of 93% and strength of 350 MPa. \n\nThe microstructure exhibited a homogeneous distribution of fine (>1?m) \n\nclosed pores. They also addressed the hazard decreasing level of the \n\nprocess due to the passivation of the surface, which comes from the \n\nheavily comminuted Al particles (~1?m). This intensive milling of \n\nparticles is carried out in organic media, i.e. acetone, at temperatures of \n\n12\u00b0C. The small additions of zirconia, up to 5 vol.%, lead to \n\nconsiderably reducing in reaction bonding times. Even though Al \n\npowder presented some impurities, e.g. Si, Mn etc, no intergranular glass \n\nphase was observed by TEM (CLAUSSEN, et al., 1990). \nAccording to Claussen, Wu and Janssen, the RBAO process starts from \n\nprecursor mixtures consisting of Al and Al2O3 (CLAUSSEN, et al., \n1989), (WU, et al., 1993), (JANSSEN, et al., 2002). In practically all \n\ncases, ZrO2 is added to enhance oxidation and to improve microstructure \n\nand mechanical properties of the final product. The precursor mixtures \n\nare intensively milled in order to reduce the particle size, mainly that of \n\nAl, and to achieve a high degree of homogenization. Green bodies for \n\nRBAO contain about 30\u201345 vol. % of aluminium which bonds the \n\nalumina particles so that binder additions are not required. RBAO \n\npowder compacts reach substantially high-green strength, i.e., isostatic \n\ncompaction at pressures as low as 170MPa is sufficient to obtain green \n\nbodies with high strength (20MPa in 4-point bending) that can be \n\nextensively green machined to complex shapes and down to very low \n\nwall thickness values below 50 \u00b5m. (JANSSEN, et al., 2002) After \n\nmachining, the green compacts are subjected to a two-step heat \n\ntreatment in air in order to first oxidize Al and then sinter the material. \n\nThe oxidation of Al is associated with a 28% volume expansion and \n\ntogether with the high-green densities (typically >60% T.D., up to 75% \n\npossible) this leads to a reduced sintering shrinkage of about 10\u201315%. \n\nThe newly formed, very fine Al2O3 sinters and bonds the originally \n\nadded Al2O3. The sintered material has typical grain sizes of 1\u20131.5 \u00b5m \n\nand 0.5 \u00b5m for Al2O3 and ZrO2, respectively. RBAO composites tested \n\nwithout any machining, i.e., as fired, using a \u201cPunch-on-Three-\n\nEquiaxed-Balls\u201d test configuration exhibit typical strength values of 700 \n\nMPa after pressureless sintering and >1 GPa after HIPing. (JANSSEN, \n\net al., 2002).  \n\n\n\n7 \n\nThe process can be modified in various ways, e.g. to form reaction-\n\nbonded mullite (RBM). \n\n  \n\n2.1.2 RBM technique \n\nIn the case of RBM process, SiC instead of Al2O3 is added to the \n\nprecursor powder (WU and CLAUSSEN, 1990), (SCHEPPOKAT, et al., \n1998), (SCHEPPOKAT, et al., 1999). The large volume increase (108%) \n\nassociated to the SiC oxidation together with the 28% volume increase \n\nfrom Al oxidation make extremely low (<0.2% linear) sintering \n\nshrinkage possible, provided the green density is high (>72% T.D.). \n\nRBM may attain strength values of 250 MPa. \n\n \n\n2.1.3 3A technique \n\nAs far as powder preparation is concerned, this process is similar to the \n\nRBAO process, however, it includes a redox reaction between \n\naluminium and the oxide of another metal (CLAUSSEN, et al., 1996), \n(GARCIA, et al., 1998), (JANSSEN, et al., 2002), (SCHEPPOKAT, et \n\nal., 2005). The basic reaction can be written as \n\n(s) a b(s) y(s) 2 3(s)Al Me O MexAl Al O? ? ?  1 \n\nSintering has to take place under vacuum or in an inert atmosphere to \n\nprevent reaction between Al with oxygen and nitrogen from atmosphere. \n\nExamples of application of oxides, which were found in literature, are \n\nCr2O3, Fe2 O3, Nb2O5, TiO2, and ZrO2(CLAUSSEN, et al., 1996). The \n\nprocess can be modified by using a metallic material, such as Cr, Fe, or \n\nMo, instead of the metal oxide, and adding only a small amount (?1 wt. \n\n%) of Al for sinter kinetics assisting (JANSSEN, et al., 2008). This \nversion of the 3A process has the advantage that the highly exothermic \n\nredox reaction takes place only on a very small scale, i.e., between Al \n\nand the oxide layer on particles of the other metal, so that higher heating \n\nrates can be used. Advantages of the 3A process are high-green strength \n\nallowing green machining, pressureless sintering, and compositional \n\nflexibility (CLAUSSEN, et al., 1996). \n\n \n\n2.1.4 Other reaction bonding techniques \n\nOther types of reaction bonding techniques are found in literature, for \n\ninstance, Silicon Nitride (TRAVITZKY and CLAUSSEN, 1992), \n\nAluminium Niobate and Cromate (GARCIA, et al., 1998) (GARCIA, et \nal., 1999). Applying reaction bonding route for silicon nitride causes the \n\nmaterial to improve its mechanical properties, e.g. strength raised to 510 \n\n\n\n8 \n\n \n\nMPa, and when infiltrated with a Ti-39 wt% Al alloy the toughness \n\nraised to > 5 MPa  .  \n \n\n2.2 ALUMINIUM CARBIDE \n\nThe creep strength of the aluminium carbide particles-reinforced silicon \n\ncarbide matrix composites increases with the volume fraction of \n\naluminium carbide particles dispersed in the matrix. It can be accounted \n\nfor, almost exclusively, by the effect of this fraction on the threshold \n\nstress (ZHU, et al., 2000). Aluminium carbide can be used as an abrasive \n\nin high-speed cutting tools due to its high hardness, i.e. approximately \n\nthe hardness of topaz.(SAVEKER and BONNELL, 2000). Aluminium \n\ncarbide is also suitable for grain refinement of Mg alloys with only 5% \n\nadditions of Al4C3, which in turn act as nuclei for heterogeneous \n\nnucleation for Mg alloys phases (NIMITYONGSKUL, et al., 2010). It is \n\nmoreover used for strengthening Al alloys present a very particular creep \n\nbehaviour, with a lower and a higher temperature variation, which in \n\nturn can be predicted by models found in literature (GURJAR, et al., \n1993) and follow a power law creep (DOBE\u0160, et al., 2012).  \n\nWand and co-workers (WANG, et al., 2004) evaluated the reaction \n\nbetween Al and C in binary alloys by means of Differential Scanning \n\nCalorimetry (DSC) and X-Ray Diffractometry (XRD), Figure 1.  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 1 - DSC of non isothermal Al4C3 formation (WANG, et al., 2004). \n\n\n\n9 \n\nAccording to the authors the wide peak between 688\u00b0C and 1122\u00b0C is \n\nrelated to the aluminium carbide formation. The reaction between Al and \n\nC is dependent on the type of carbon structure. The higher the contact \n\narea, the more complete is the carbide reaction (BESTERCI and \n\nPARIL\u00c1K, 2004) (BESTERCI, 2006). \n\n \n\n2.3 ALUMINIUM VAPOUR INFILTRATION  \n\nAluminium vapour infiltration is a technique that provides final parts \n\nwith well defined structures replicated from the original template \n\n(RAMBO and SIEBER, 2005). Although this technique is more suitable \n\nto build ceramic structures from biotemplates rather than other liquid \n\ninfiltration techniques, it is also suitable to produce a very fine grain-size \n\nceramic phase due to the chemical reaction among the aluminium and \n\ncarbon powder. Some works report the final structure of those \n\nbiotemplated ceramics (Figure 2). \n\n \n\nFigure 2 - Carbon preform used in aluminium vapour infiltration (a) and \n\nrespective porous ceramic structure produced (b). (BERTI, 2008). \n\na) \n\nb) \n\n\n\n10 \n\n \n\n \n\nThe carbon structure used in this technique presented bimodal pore size \n\ndistribution with average pore size of 10 and 50 \u00b5m (see Figure 2 a) and \n\nb)). The resulted final structures showed a well defined replication of the \n\ncarbon perform. The structure walls are formed by a very fine sized \n\nparticle of alumina. \n\nThe reactions that take place during the heat treatment are carbide \n\nformation followed by oxidation. Those reactions convert aluminium \n\npowder in aluminium oxide, according to the following equations: \n\n? Al4C3 formation (equation 2): \n\n(s) (s) 4 3(s)4Al + 3C Al C?  2  \n\n? Al2O3 formation by Al4C3 oxidation (equation 3): \n\n4 3(s) 2(g) 2 3(s) (g)Al C 9O 4Al O 6CO? ? ?  3 \n\n \n\n2.4 REACTION KINETICS \n\nReaction kinetics is determined by measuring either the amount of metal \n\nconsumed or by the amount of oxygen consumed or even by the amount \n\nof oxide produced (BIRKS, et al., 2006) (YOUNG, 2008). In practical \nterms only the oxygen comsuption can be continuously assessed. \n\nThermogravimetry allows the metal comsuption to be measured. To \n\ndetermine the oxidation kinetics, any of above mentioned methods can \n\nprovide quantitative parameters. The principal rate laws of reaction \n\nkinetics are (BIRKS, et al., 2006): \n? Linear law, for which the rate of reaction is \n\nindependent of time, is found predominantly in \n\nreactions whose rate is controlled by a surface-\n\nreaction step or by diffusion through the gas \n\nphase. \n\n? Parabolic law, for which the rate is inversely \nproportional to the square root of time, is found \n\nwhen diffusion through the scale is the rate-\n\ndetermining process. \n\n? Logarithmic law, which is only observed for the \nformation of very thin films of oxide, i.e., between \n\n2 and 4 nm, and is generally associated with low \n\ntemperatures. \n\nAdditionally, some systems may even present combined reaction \n\nkinetics laws, e.g. oxidation of niobium in air, at 1000\u00b0C initially \n\nfollows a parabolic law and later becomes linear. \n\n\n\n11 \n\n2.4.1 Oxidation kinetics \n\nIn the last decade several materials have been studied regarding their \n\noxidation kinetics, e.g. carbides (GOZZI, et al., 1998), phosphated iron \n(REBEYRAT, et al., 2000), nickel (NIKLASSON and KARMHAG, \n\n2003), and nitrides (XINMEI and KUO-CHIH, 2009) among others. \n\nMoreover, mathematical models are also presented in literature \n\n(BROCK and PRYOR, 1973) (DOILNITSYNA, 2002) (CHOU, 2006). \n\nNickel particles with varying sizes were submitted to isothermal \n\noxidation by thermogravimetric experiments (RASHIDI, 2011). In this \n\nstudy weight gain kinetics was evaluated regarding specific area. An \n\nactivation energy of ~108 kJ/mol was found for both the nano and \n\nmicro-sized particles. A theoretical modelling involving the contribution \n\nof grain boundary diffusion was in good agreement with experimental \n\nresults. Oxidation kinetics of free and matrix enclosed nickel particles \n\nexhibited dissimilar activation energies of oxidation (BROCK and \n\nPRYOR, 1973), (KARMHAG, et al., 2000).  \nKinetic modelling of oxidation of aluminium in oxygen and its \n\nmorphology has been extensively studied with heating rates of 1 to 40 \n\nK/min (BECK, et al., 1966) (RAI, et al., 2006) (SCHOENITZ, et al., \n2010). The activation energy of oxidation was found to occur in two \n\nstages, depending on the heating rates applied. Values found were \n\n393\u00b1108 and 341\u00b1105 kJ/mol for the first and second oxidation stages, \n\nrespectively, using 5 K/min. The higher the heating rates, the lower the \n\nactivation energy of oxidation, both in the first and in the second stage. \n\nAdditionally, the energy of activation value becomes more imprecise \n\nwith the application of higher heating rates. Moreover, the activation \n\nenergy for combustion of aluminium nanoparticles is smaller than that of \n\na bulk aluminium sample (AUMANN, et al., 1995). Corroborating to the \n\nlast statement, the activation energy of oxidation reached 196.8\u00b114.8 \n\nand 127.3\u00b19.5 for micro- and nanosized aluminium particles, \n\nrespectively (PIVKINA, et al., 2004). Those values are not in agreement \n\nto those presented by (PARK, et al., 2005).  \nStudies found in literature have evaluated the oxidation energy of \n\noxidation of aluminium particles within RBAO mixtures (WU, et al., \n1993) (SUVACI, et al., 2004). An oxidation activation energy of 222 \n\nkJ/mol was found (AARON, et al., 2005) , and aluminium particle \n\noxidation was claimed independent on particle size.  \n\nBoron carbide activation energy presented values of 209.4\u00b111.4, \n\n212.7\u00b135.8 and 219.2\u00b145.3 kJ/mol for fine, medium and coarse particle \n\n\n\n12 \n\n \n\nsizes, respectively, as measured by isothermal thermogravimetric \n\nexperiments (LI. and QIU, 2007). \n\nSoot particles with size resolved oxidation kinetics presented values of \n\n164 kJ/mol for activation energy of oxidation of nanosized particles \n\n(HIGGINS, et al., 2002). \n\nSilicon nitride oxidation kinetics was 310\u00b125 kJ/mol and depending on \n\nthe temperature it exhibiteds parabolic (lower than 1250\u00b0C) and non-\n\nparabolic rate law (higher than 1300\u00b0C) (PERSSON, et al., 1993). \nAdditionally, when impure silicon nitride is oxidized in dry air or dry \n\noxygen, a protective oxide is formed, which retards further oxidation. \n\nParabolic rate law is observed for such materials (HORTON, 1969). \n\nIn SiC particles-reinforced aluminium matrix composites, the interaction \n\nat high temperature between solid- or liquid aluminium and silicon \n\ncarbide crystals always proceeded via dissolution-precipitation \n\nmechanisms (VIALA, et al., 1993).  \n\nDirect oxidation of Al-Mg alloys in Mg matrices presented activation \n\nenergy of 361 kJ/mol. That alloy firstly reacts with Al-Mg and then \n\noxidized into spinel phases (VENUGOPALAN, et al., 1996).  \n\nSilicon carbide activation energy of oxidation was found as 118 kJ/mol \n\n(HOU, et al., 2009). In this study, a mathematical model was also \n\nsuggested. The oxidation of such material also presented dependency on \n\nthe vicinity material (LIU, 1997). The higher the amount of yttrium \n\naluminium garnet, the lower the energy of activation of oxidation of \n\nsilicon carbide particles(QUANLI, et al., 2007).  \nIn carbon long fibre-reinforced carbon matrix composites, silicon is \n\ninfiltrated for enhancing oxidation. Those composites are dependent not \n\nonly on the composite microstructure and fibre architecture, but also on \n\nthe tensile strength in oxidizing environments (LAMOUROUX, et al., \n\n1995). \n\n \n\n2.5 COMPOSITES \n\nComposite materials have unique combination of properties, i.e. wear \n\nresistance, strength at high temperature, and damage tolerance. \n\nComposites are applied in several engineering fields, e.g. aerospace, gas \n\nturbines, automotive, and biomedical. The properties of composites are \n\nselected due to its very specific characteristics, which have to fit to the \n\napplication, and simple comparisons between those properties might \n\nyield in wrong interpretation. If the ultimate bending strength of an \n\noxide ceramic composite, i.e. ~200MPa, is compared to the ultimate \n\nbending strength of a monolithic ceramic, i.e. 1000MPa, it may be \n\n\n\n13 \n\nconsidered that the composite has a fifth of the monolithic material \n\nvalue. This is true, however, it is not a fair material selection \n\ncomparison. A composite material might present lower strength in \n\ncomparison with its monolithic material, but it also show damage \n\ntolerance and it also present better mechanical properties at higher \n\ntemperatures, i.e. strength, creep and fatigue properties. Therefore, the \n\ncomplete comparison must be taken into account for a correct \n\ninterpretation. \n\nComposites can be classified according to its matrix material type in: \n\n? Metal Matrix Composites (MMC), in which a metal is a matrix \nphase, e.g. aluminium, magnesium, iron, cobalt, copper; and a \n\ndispersed ceramic or metallic phase, e.g. oxides, carbides, \n\ntungsten or molybdenum; \n\n? Polymeric Matrix Composites (PMC), in which apply a \nthermoplastic or set polymer is the matrix phase, e.g. nylon, \n\npolysterene, unsaturated polyester, or epoxy; and a embedded \n\nglass, carbon, steel or Kevlar fibres as reinforcement. Fibres are \n\ncommercially available in several patterns, which are selected \n\naccording to the specific application; \n\n? Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC), in which a non-oxide or \noxide ceramic is the matrix phase, e.g. silicon carbide, silicon \n\nnitride, alumina, or mullite; and a embedded non-oxide or oxide \n\nfibre reinforcement, such as carbon, carbides, sapphire, alumina, \n\nmullite, as reinforcement. Those fibres are also available in \n\nseveral patterns.  \n\nFurther classification can be given to particulate composites according to \n\ngeometrical and spatial characteristics (CALLISTER, 2000), \n\n(CALLISTER, 2006): \n\n? Concentration; \n\n? Size; \n\n? Shape; \n\n? Distribution, which relates how particles organize themselves \nwith the matrix; \n\n? Orientation, which relates how particles orientate themselves \naccording to the frame axis. \n\nThe relation between reinforcement and matrix phase is also classified \n\naccording to geometrical and spatial characteristics: \n\n? Particle-reinforced composites, which may present large \nparticles or dispersion-strengthened particles; \n\n\n\n14 \n\n \n\n? Fibre-reinforced composites, which may present continuous and \naligned fibres or discontinuous aligned and randomly oriented \n\nfibres.  \n\n? Structural composites, which may present laminates forms or \nsandwich panel. \n\nThe correct decision of which composite may be used in a specific \n\napplication is a function of the combination of the composite properties, \n\nwhich are related to every material type, and to the requirements of the \n\napplication. The mechanical properties of a composite represent a key \n\nfactor for selection. Figure 3 presents composite strength values with \n\nvolume fraction of fibres variation. \n\n \n\n \n\n Figure 3 - Strength as a function of the volume fraction of fibres. \n\n(MARTIN, 2006) \n\n \n\nIn this case, it is indicated which phase is dominant regarding \n\nmechanical properties of the composite (continuous and dashed lines, \n\nwhere the first represents the dominant phase). When the fibres volume \n\nfraction, Vf, is lower than the critical fibres volume fraction, Vcrit, then \n\nthe composite mechanical properties are matrix dominated, which \n\nimplies a composite with properties similar to the matrix phase. On the \n\nother hand, in cases of Vf values higher than the Vcrit then the composite \n\nmechanical properties are fibre dominated, which implies a composite \n\nwith properties similar to the fibre phase. One may observe that although \n\n\n\n15 \n\nvalues in the lower vicinity of the Vf are indeed fibre dominant, due to \n\nthe volume fraction of the matrix/fibre ratio, the overall composite \n\nmechanical properties yet present a matrix dominant phase behaviour. \n\nThis observation implies that it is necessary more than a minimum Vf, \n\nwhere fibre phase is dominant, so that the mixture cause the composite \n\nto present a sensitive mechanical strength increasing. Therefore, in order \n\nto produce fibre-dominant mechanical properties composite, it is \n\nnecessary to produce composites with a minimum volume fraction of \n\nfibre. This observation infers that fibre dominant mechanical behaviour \n\ncomposites are slightly sensitive to matrix mechanical properties \n\nvariations, at least from a mechanical point of view. \n\nEfforts have been made in order to develop low-cost alternative routes to \n\nproduce CMC\u2019s (LUNDBERG and ECKERBOM, 1995), (JURF and \n\nBUTNER, 2000), (HASLAM, et al., 2000), (HOLMQUIST, et al., \n2000). Some methods rely on multiple bundle/fabric infiltration which \n\nresults in cost increasing due to the time-consuming process \n\n(HEGEDUS, 1991), (LANGE, et al., 1995), (JOHNSON, et al., 1998), \n\n(SHE, et al., 2002)  (SIMON, 2005). Figure 4 presents a schematic CMC \n\nprocess where fabric is infiltrated with slurry, and then laid-up, vacuum \n\nbagged and thermal treated. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 4 - CMC fabrication process (JURF and BUTNER, 2000). \n\n \n\n\n\n16 \n\n \n\n2.5.1 Porous materials and porous matrices \n\nSeveral sources in literature have related methods to obtain ceramics \n\nwith porosity intentionally developed within the material. These \n\nmaterials are also known as ceramic with functional porosity. Those \n\nmaterials are used in wide fields of engineering.  \n\nA processing method to produce a carbon-fibre-reinforced silicon \n\ncarbide with low-cost process was reported (MENTZ, et al., 2006). That \n\nprocess yields a reaction-bonded silicon carbide matrix and avoids \n\nreactive damage of the carbon fibres with fibre-dominated behaviour and \n\nporous matrix. \n\nPorous structures have been reported for fabricating of matrix \n\ncomposites. Weakly bonded particle mixtures of mullite and alumina \n\nwere assessed as candidate matrices for use in porous matrix ceramic \n\ncomposites. Conditions for the deflection of a matrix crack at a fibre-\n\nmatrix interface were used to identify the combinations of modulus and \n\ntoughness of the fibres and the matrix for which damage-tolerant \n\nbehaviour is expected to occur in the composite. For an aging \n\ntemperature of 1200\u00b0C, the critical time exceeds 10000 h for mullite-rich \n\nmixtures (FUJITA, et al., 2004). This reference reported variation in the \nporosity of pure mullite compacts with aging time (Figure 5). Despite \n\nthe slight change in powder density, the porosity of the compacts \n\nremains essentially constant over the entire range of aging times, within \n\n0.2% of its initial value. \n\n \n\n\n\n17 \n\n \n\nFigure 5 - (a) Effects of composition and aging time on compact porosity. \n\n(b) Results in (a), normalized by the initial (green) porosity at the same \n\ncomposition (FUJITA, et al., 2004). \n\n \n\nMullite-alumina mixtures exhibit physical and mechanical \n\ncharacteristics that make them attractive for use as porous matrices in \n\nceramic composites. The key attributes include stable porosity at the \n\n\n\n18 \n\n \n\ntargeted service temperatures of oxide composites, especially for \n\nalumina concentrations&lt;20%, and combinations of modulus and \n\ntoughness that should lead to deflection of a matrix crack at a fibre-\n\nmatrix interface (FUJITA, et al., 2004). \n\nThe composites Nextel fibres 610 and 720 with mullite porous matrix \n\nhave been reported to present favourable mechanical properties both at \n\nroom temperature and after high-temperature long-term aging. In this \n\nreference, the matrix was produced by colloidal processing (SIMON, \n\n2005). This route provided a composite that exhibits damage-tolerance \n\nbehaviour with fibres pull-out characteristics (Figure 6a and b). \n\nHighlighted in Figure 7a) and b) is the microstructure of the composite \n\nmatrix. Nanometric particles of mullite surround micrometric mullite \n\npowder displaying core-shell structure. \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 6 - (a) SEM micrographs of the fracture surfaces of N720/M \n\ncomposite tensile test specimens, displaying: (a) uncorrelated fracture of \n\nfibres within the fibre bundle and (b) fractured fibre after debonding from \n\nthe porous mullite matrix. (SIMON, 2005) \n\n\n\n19 \n\n \n\nFigure 7 - SEM micrographs of the used ceramic powders: (a) mullite \n\npowder, and (b) mullite-nanopowder (M-N) mixture displaying composite \n\nparticles with core-shell structure (SIMON, 2005). \n\n \n\nMore significant enhancements in stability have been achieved through \n\nthe use of mullite as the main matrix constituent and alumina as the \n\nbinder (LEVI, et al., 1998) (CARELLI, et al., 2002). In a common \n\nimplementation, mullite powder is dispersed in aqueous slurry and \n\ninfiltrated into a fibre preform via a vacuum-assisted technique. The two \n\nprocessing routes lead to distinctly different matrix topologies, shown \n\nschematically in Figure 8a. Compositional maps of two prototypical \n\nsystems are presented in Figure 8 (b) (FUJITA, et al., 2005), (ZOK, \n\n2006). \n\n\n\n20 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 8 - Energy-dispersive spectroscopy/transmission electron \n\nmicroscope maps of thin foils of (a) 80% mullite/20% alumina (without \n\nprecursor addition) and (b) pure mullite compact impregnated 10 times \n\nwith the concentrated precursor (ZOK, 2006). \n\n \n\nThe preceding processing routes and the resulting microstructures are \n\ncharacterized by three attributes (ZOK, 2006): \n\n? The mixed mullite/alumina slurry method allows both \nmatrix phases to be infiltrated simultaneously. By contrast, \n\nthe precursor route requires additional steps, beyond that of \n\nslurry infiltration, and is thus more costly.  \n\n? The presence of particulate alumina can compromise the \nstability of the mullite network, especially if its proportion \n\nexceeds the percolation threshold (FUJITA, et al., 2004). \n\nConversely, if the slurry is comprised of only mullite and \n\nthe alumina is introduced subsequently via the precursor \n\nroute, the contiguity of the mullite network is ensured. \n\n? Because of limitations on the maximum fraction of alumina \n(to inhibit densification), the slurry route results in matrices \n\nthat are relatively weak. Although essential for crack \n\ndeflection, this weakness compromises the off-axis \n\nproperties, especially the resistance to delamination. In \n\ncontrast, the precursor allows filling of the void spaces \n\n\n\n21 \n\nbetween the particles in the network (at least while the \n\npores remain open), resulting in an increase in the \n\nmechanical integrity of the network. The latter route \n\nprovides access to a broader range of matrix properties. \n\nOther study related synthesis and characterization of porous \n\nmullite/alumina mixtures for use as matrices in oxide fibre composites \n\n(FUJITA, et al., 2005). An assessment was made of the utility of a \nprecursor-derived alumina (PDA) for controlling both the modulus and \n\nthe toughness of mullite-rich particle mixtures. In this reference the PDA \n\nwas Al powder slowly digested in a solution of AlCl3.6H2O in deionised \n\nwater at 85\u00b0C. Property changes are probed through models of \n\nmechanical behaviour of bonded particle aggregates. Consideration of \n\nthe conditions for crack deflection at a fibre\u2013matrix interface to ensure \n\ndamage tolerance in a fibre composite was evaluated as well. Figure 9 \n\npresents some Fracture surfaces of three representative porous compacts. \n\n \n\n\n\n22 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 9 - Fracture surfaces of three representative porous compacts, all \n\nwith pure mullite particle slurry, but with varying volumes of precursor \n\nderived alumina: (a, b) 0; (c, d) 8.3%; (e, f) 15.8%, after aging for 2h at \n\n1200\u00b0C (FUJITA, et al., 2005). \n\n \n\nThe precursor-derived route has the additional advantage over the mixed \n\nmullite/alumina particle route in that the contiguity of the mullite \n\nparticle network is not compromised. Consequently, the structure is \n\nrelatively immune from densification at the targeted upper use \n\ntemperature for the corresponding fibre composites. Comparisons \n\nbetween predicted and measured properties suggest that the precursor-\n\nderived phase exhibits some degree of segregation to the particle \n\njunctions, yielding larger property elevations relative to that for a \n\nuniform precursor distribution (FUJITA, et al., 2005). There are several \ncommercial available fibres. Fabrics are produced by interweaving fibre \n\ntows in several satin sizing. Braiding is defined as \"the process of \n\n\n\n23 \n\ninterlacing three or more threads in such a way that they cross one \n\nanother and are laid in a diagonal formation, flat tubular or solid \n\nconstructions may be formed in this way\" (FARNFIELD and ALVEY, \n\n1975).  \n\n \n\n2.5.2 Mechanical properties \n\nComposites are known by their capability of enabling damage tolerance \n\nat room temperature, along with their ability of bearing load at high \n\ntemperatures. Considering toughening mechanisms, there are a few that \n\nmay be present in composite material, e.g. fibre pull out, fibre bridging, \n\ncrack deflection etc. Figure 10 illustrates those toughening mechanisms. \n\n \n\nFigure 10 - Toughening mechanisms in composite materials. \n\n \n\nThrough bridging toughening mechanisms, fibres hinder crack \n\npropagation by preventing both upper and lower parts of crack from \n\ndistancing from each other. When the crack extension crosses fibres \n\ndeformation limit, then fibres start to fail. The intact part of the fibre \n\nstarts to pull the failed part out of the matrix, in the fractured zone and \n\nthe attrition between fibre and matrix surface is responsible for some \n\nenergy consumption. An implicit toughening mechanism is present in \nthe previously cited cases, which is crack deflection. Once the crack has \n\nto surround the fibre in order to keep the fibre intact for bearing loads, \n\nthen crack deflection is a prerequisite for bridging and fibre pull out. \n\nInstead of it, if the crack moves through the fibre, than the composite \n\n\n\n24 \n\n \n\nmechanical property comes closer to monolithic ceramic material and \n\ntherefore presents no damage tolerance behaviour. In the literature there \n\nis an approach which gives a criterion for distinguishing whether the \n\nmatrix/fibre combination will result in a penetration or a deflection of a \n\nmoving crack through fibre/matrix interface (HE and HUTCHINSON, \n\n1989), (HE, et al., 1994). According to that theory, a combination of \nelastic mismatch and interfacial toughness between interface and matrix \n\npredicts whether the crack moves or not through the fibre (HE and \n\nHUTCHINSON, 1989). The zones, wherein penetration or deflection \n\noccurs, are presented in Figure 11. \n\n \n\nFigure 11 - He-Hutchinson criteria for crack deflection. (ZOK and LEVI, \n\n2001). \n\n \n\nThe information in this graphic infers that a matrix/fibre interface with \n\nvalues closer to one, i.e. heavy bonded fibre and matrix, tends to cause \n\nthe crack move through the fibre, which is not an interesting feature. In \n\norder to enable the deflection feature in a composite two alternatives are \n\nsuggested: either by coating fibres (MORGAN, et al., 1995), \n\n(BOAKYE, et al., 1999), (KERANS and PARTHASARATHY, 1999), \n\n(CHAWLA, et al., 2000) (JACKSON, 2006), (JACKSON, 2006) or \nintroducing porosity within the matrix (ZOK and LEVI, 2001), \n\n(MATTONI, et al., 2001), (FUJITA, et al., 2004), (FUJITA, et al., \n2005). \n\n \n\n\n\n25 \n\n2.5.3 High Temperature Properties of Composites \n\nThe most notable feature contrasting monolithic and composite ceramic \n\nmaterials lays on the fact that composite materials can bear similar \n\nmagnitudes of load both at room and at high temperatures and can also \n\nwithstand damage without brittle fracture. In this section, some data \n\nconcerning these composite features are introduced.  \n\nPorous-matrix oxide/oxide CMCs exhibit several behaviour trends that \n\nare distinctly different from those exhibited by traditional CMCs with a \n\nfibre\u2013matrix interface. Most SiC-fibre-containing CMCs exhibit longer \n\nlife under static loading and shorter life under cyclic loading. For these \n\nmaterials, fatigue is significantly more damaging than creep.  \n\nThe high-temperature mechanical behaviour of a porous matrix Nextel \n\n610/aluminosilicate composite was investigated (LEE, et al., 1998) \n\n(ZAWADA, et al., 2003). Results revealed low creep resistance limiting \nthe use of that CMC to temperatures below 1000\u00b0C. Because creep was \n\nshown to be much more damaging than cyclic loading to oxide\u2013oxide \n\nCMCs with porous matrix, high temperature creep resistance remains \n\namong the key issues that must be addressed before using these \n\nmaterials in advanced aero space applications (RUGGLES-WRENN, et \nal., 2006), (MEHRMAN, et al., 2007), (RUGGLES-WRENN and \n\nBRAUN, 2007). \n\nCeramic matrix composites, capable of maintaining high strength and \n\nfracture toughness at high temperatures are prime candidate materials for \n\naerospace applications. Additionally, the low density of CMCs and their \n\nhigher service temperatures, together with a reduced need for cooling \n\nair, contributes for improving high-temperature performance when \n\ncompared to conventional nickel-based superalloys (ZAWADA, et al., \n2003). Concurrent efforts in optimization of CMCs and in design of \n\ncombustion chambers are expected to accelerate the insertion of the \n\nCMCs into aerospace turbine engine applications, such as combustor \n\nwalls of turbines (PARLIER and RITTI, 2003) (MATTONI, et al., \n\n2005), (PARTHASARATHY, et al., 2005). Up to date, the majority of \nCMCs development has been driven by the continuous will to improve \n\nthe performance of military and commercial aircrafts (PARLIER and \n\nRITTI, 2003). CMC are suitable for applications up to 1100\u00b0C such as \n\nflame-holder, exhaust cone and inner flaps for convergent nozzles (see \n\nFigure 12). \n\n\n\n26 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 12 - Typical CMC projects on Jet Engines (PARLIER and RITTI, \n\n2003). \n\n \n\nBecause these applications require exposure to oxidizing environments, \n\nthe thermodynamic stability and oxidation resistance of CMCs are vital \n\nissues. The need for environmentally stable composites motivated the \n\ndevelopment of CMCs based on environmentally stable oxide \n\nconstituents (LANGE, et al., 1995)   (MOUCHON and COLOMBAN, \n\n1995), (TU, et al., 1996), (SZWEDA, et al., 1997).  \nFrom a decade ago, oxide composites have emerged as viable candidates \n\nfor high-temperature thermostructural applications. Their rapid evolution \n\nis attributable to recent developments in materials and microstructural \n\nconcepts, both for enabling damage tolerance and for ensuring long-term \n\nmorphological stability at the targeted service temperatures. These are \n\nexpected to play a significant role in future material designs and their \n\nimplementation in engineering systems (ZOK, 2006). \n\nThe advantages for the developers are obvious: the low specific weight \n\nand the high specific strength over a large temperature range. Since the \n\nstart of development, test times of 8900 s (approx. 2,5 h) at wall \n\ntemperatures of up to 2000 K and combustion-chamber pressures of 10-\n\n11 bars were reached within the scope of various test campaigns. \n\nAdvanced reusable space launch vehicles will likely incorporate fibre-\n\n\n\n27 \n\nreinforced CMCs in critical propulsion components (SCHMIDT, et al., \n\n2004). \n\nThe application of two oxide\u2013oxide composites, Nextel \n\n720/aluminosilicate and Nextel 720/alumina, in the design of a \n\ncombustor was evaluated using a combination of rig testing and \n\nnumerical analysis. The rig tests showed the alumina-matrix composites \n\nto survive up to ten hours of use, while the alumniosilicate matrix \n\ncomposites suffered radial cracks in the \u00b145\u00b0 oriented regions (Figure \n\n13). The use of appropriate fibre architecture to meet the combustion \n\ndesign needs is suggested (PARTHASARATHY, et al., 2005) \n\n \n\n  \n\nFigure 13 - Tests in a combustor: (a) alumina matrix composites with no \n\ncracks; (b) aluminosilicate matrix composites exhibiting cracks at the same \n\nlocation. (c) combustor under conditions for soot formation, . (d) maximum \n\ntemperature reached to be around 1200\u00b0C.(PARTHASARATHY, et al., \n\n2005)  \n\n  \n\n\n\n28 \n\n \n\n3 MATERIALS AND METHODS \n\nThe experimental procedure of this work can be summarized as: \n\n? Slurry preparation and characterization;  \n\n? Composite panel production;  \n\n? Thermal treatment development;  \n\n? Physical and mechanical properties characterization of both the \ncomposite panel and the matrix material; \n\n? Oxidation kinetics determination. \n \n\n3.1 MATERIALS \n\nFor the RBMAO process development the used raw materials were \n\naluminium powder (Eckart-Werke, Ecka AS 081 \u2013&lt;45 \u00b5m), mullite \n\npowder (Treibacher, WFM 0.08 \u2013 80 \u00b5m) and phenolic resin powder \n\n(novolac, Hexion corp., PF 0227 SP 01). For adjusting the slurry \n\nviscosity, a phosphate ester (PE) dispersant (Zschimmer &amp; Schwarz, \n\nDolacol D1001) was used. In order to produce composites from \n\nRBMAO matrix, a reinforcement was added (Nextel 720 \u2122 woven \n\nfibre, 3M) into eight-harness satin woven fabrics. For the oxidation \n\nkinetics experiment commercial aluminium carbide (99% Al4C3, Sigma \n\nAldrich, USA, 325#mesh) was used. \n\n \n\n3.2 POWDER PREPARATION \n\nThe slurry for infiltrating the fibre fabric woven was prepared by \n\ncombining the ceramic powder, i.e. mullite, and the metallic powder, i.e. \n\naluminium, and milling the mixture using an attritor mill (NFT PE 075), \n\nballs and jar of Zirconia and using acetone as milling media without \n\natmosphere controlling. For each mill batch the mixture consisted of \n\n88.6 g of mullite and 11.4 g of aluminium powder. In order to evaluate \n\nrelationship of particle size and milling time a standard mixture was \n\nloaded into the mill jar and samples of the slurry were taken out in \n\nintervals of every hour. The particle size distributions of these samples \n\nwere measured (Mastersizer, Malvern MS5). The measuring procedure \n\nconsisted of braking agglomeration by dipping an ultrasonic probe into \n\nthe collected sample for 1 min and proceeding the measuring right \n\nafterwards.  \n\n \n\n\n\n29 \n\n3.3 VISCOSITY DETERMINATION OF THE SLURRY \n\nThe viscosity determination of the slurry to be used in the fibre fabric \n\nwoven infiltration was split in three steps:  optimising dispersant amount \n\n(in the range from 0.6 to 2.0% of solid content, according to the \n\nsupplier); finding the maximum slurry solid content; and measuring the \n\neffect of the phenolic resin addition. Moreover, before any viscosity \n\nmeasurement, the slurry was dispersed by dipping an ultrasonic probe \n\ninto the slurry container for 1 min. A cup/rotor set was used in the \n\nviscometer (MV1, Haake RV 20). The shearing stresses measured were \n\nin the range from 1 to 400 s\n-1\n\n, with a dwelling time of 1 min and then \n\nreturning to 1 s\n-1\n\n according to Figure 14: \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 14 - Viscosity measurement set points \n\n \n\nA calibration test was done previously to the viscosity measurements. It \n\nconsisted of measuring the viscosity of a standard fluid (Brookfield \n\nstandard fluid with nominally 50 mPa.s) within the rate variation range. \n\nThe first step consisted in preparing samples with 40 ml slurry (45 wt.%) \n\nin different containers and varying the dispersant amount for each one, \n\nwhich will be tagged as PE%.  \n\nThe second step consisted in preparing samples with 40 ml slurry (with \n\nthe PE% optmised) in different containers with stoichiometric amount of \n\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nR\na\nte\n\n (\ns-\n\n1\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n Rate\n\n\n\n30 \n\n \n\nphenolic resin in relation to the aluminium content and varying the \n\nparticle volume fraction for each one.  \n\nThe third step consisted of prepare samples with 40ml of slurry (with the \n\nbetter PE%) in different containers with stoichiometric amount of carbon \n\ngraphite in relation to the aluminium content and varying the particle \n\nvolume fraction for each one. \n\n \n\n3.4 THERMAL TREATMENT CYCLE DETERMINATION \n\nIn order to determine the set points of the thermal treatment to which the \n\ncomposite panel would be submitted, a characterization of the raw \n\nmaterial mixture of the matrix was carried out. The whole thermal \n\ntreatment process consisted of two programmed steps, one in inert \n\natmosphere and the other in oxidizing atmosphere. The purpose of the \n\nfirst thermal treatment is to form the intermediate carbide phase, which \n\nis a product from the reaction of the pyrolysed carbon with the \n\naluminium powder. The second thermal treatment is to oxidize the \n\npreviously formed carbide phase and to convert it in to an oxide ceramic. \n\nTherefore to characterize the thermal treatment cycles some differential \n\nthermal (DTA) and thermogravimetric (TG) analyses (Netzsch DTA/TG \n\nSTA 409) were performed. Phase analyses (Bruker AXS D8 Discovery) \n\nwere based in powder X-Ray diffraction. The XRD was set to a step of \n\n0.02\u00b0 and reading time of 2 s using k? (? = 1,5418 \u00c5). \n\nThose characterization techniques may be divided in three parts: \n\n? reaction thermal treatment;  \n\n? oxidation thermal treatment and;  \n\n? TG of mixtures in excess and in stoichiometrical additions, in \nrelation to the carbon and aluminium content. \n\nFor the reaction thermal treatment characterization, three different \n\nanalyses were performed. Firstly, a sample of the phenolic resin \n\nunderwent an inert atmosphere DTA/TG analysis with heating rate of \n\n10\u00b0C/min until 1450\u00b0C. Subsequently, a sample of the dried slurry \n\npowder containing mullite, aluminium and resin underwent an inert \n\natmosphere DTA/TG analysis with same heating cycle of the first \n\nDTA/TG test. Then, the present phases of a powder sample, which were \n\nsubmitted to the first thermal treatment, were detected by means of XRD \n\nanalysis.  \n\nFor the oxidation thermal treatment characterization, three different \n\nanalyses were done. Firstly, a sample containing mullite and aluminium \n\npowder underwent an oxidizing atmosphere DTA/TG analysis with \n\nheating rate of 10\u00b0C/min until 1450\u00b0C. Afterwards a sample of the \n\n\n\n31 \n\nmullite and aluminium powder and phenolic resin underwent a DTA/TG \n\nanalysis at the same heating cycle. Then, the present phases of powder \n\nsample, which were submitted to the second and final thermal treatment, \n\nwere determined by XRD.  \n\nAdditionally, two samples of mullite and aluminium powder were \n\nanalysed by DTA/TG. The difference between samples was the amount \n\nof resin: the first one had a stoichiometric ratio and the second one had \n\n50%mol more than the stoichiometric ratio. \n\nThe stoichiometric ratio was determined according to equation 4: \n\n                                    \n\n                        \n4 \n\n \n\nConsidering that the mixture was prepared with 88.6 g mullite and 11.4 \n\ng aluminium, the stoichiometric value was 6.9 g and the value in excess \n\nwas 9.9 g, respectively for the phenolic resin. The latest value \n\ncorresponds to the suggested set point for the oxidation thermal \n\ntreatment. \n\n \n\n3.5 FIBRE FABRIC WOVEN INFILTRATION  \n\nIn order to produce the composite panel according to the developed \n\nmatrix route suggested in this work, the fibre fabric woven had to be \n\nprepared, since it is provided with a sizing from the supplier. Before the \n\ninfiltration process, therefore, a desizing thermal treatment was \n\nperformed, following the procedure established by the supplier (3M); \n\nheating rate of 7\u00b0C/min until 700\u00b0C with dwell of 30 min for small \n\nsamples and 2 h for large samples. \n\nThe tools required for the infiltrations process are presented in Figure \n\n15. \n\n\n\n32 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 15 - Set-up of infiltration process. \n\n \n\nThe milled powder containing 88.4g mullite, 11.6 g aluminium and 6.9 g \n\nof phenolic resin was mixed with ethanol to produce a slurry for \n\ninfiltrating the fabric woven of 720 Nextel fibres. In this slurry 0.6 wt.% \n\nphosphate ester dispersant was also added. The slurry was mixed for 30 \n\nmin in a magnetic stirrer. The slurry was then poured into a container \n\nwith a wired support, which holds the fabrics and helps the extraction of \n\nthe fibre fabrics out of slurry container. Finally, fibres were dipped into \n\nthe slurry, and the infiltration process was assisted by an ultrasonic bath \n\n(Figure 16). \n\nContainer \n\nTray used as support for \n\nsamples before pressing. \n\nWired support \n\nFibre fabric \n\n\n\n33 \n\n \n\nFigure 16 - Infiltration process: (a) slurry poured into the container; (b) \n\nfibre fabric woven dipped in the slurry; (c) slurry container in a becker; (d) \n\nbecker in an ultrasonic bath. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 16 (c and d), the green cover placed over the container with \n\nslurry is wetted with ethanol in order to cause the slurry not to dry along \n\nthe infiltration process. After 10 min infiltration process, the fibres were \n\ntaken out of the slurry and placed onto the support tray in order to cast \n\noff the excess slurry, by pressing the whole set with trays and fibre \n\nfabric woven with pressure of 0.7 MPa for 30 s. After this time, nuts \n\nwere then finger tightened in order to keep the fibres together; and only \n\nlater on the pressure was released.  \n\nA cylinder was placed over the tray to better distribute the pressure onto \n\nthe tray and therefore to compact fibres with homogeneity. Then, in \n\norder to dry the infiltrated fibre fabric, the tray set was placed in a \n\nvacuum chamber for 24h. \n\n \n\n3.6 POROSITY  \n\nFor the porosity measurement two types of samples were considered:  \n\n? Dried slurry; and  \n\n? Compacted monolithic bars (as used for the mechanical test).  \nIn the first case, samples were prepared by drying the slurry so that only \n\nthe respective solid contents, 50  and 60 wt.% were evaluated. Due to the \n\na) b) \n\nc) d) \n\n\n\n34 \n\n \n\nirregular dimensions, those samples were measured by Archimedes\u2019 \n\nprinciple. \n\nIn the case of  pressed samples, the density  was first geometrically \n\ndetermined and converted to porosity.  \n\nIn both cases, the experimental plan was designed in two levels. Firstly, \n\nthe composition varied:, just mullite and aluminium powder with the \n\nsame content of the slurry for infiltration with exception of resin content. \n\nWith these samples the pressure for compaction was varied in two \n\npoints, i.e. 50 and 200 MPa.  \n\nIn the second case, the samples had the same composition of the slurry \n\nfor infiltration, and compaction pressure was 50 MPa. Moreover, the \n\npowder for the pressed samples was prepared by drying a slurry batch \n\nwith composition of 88.4 g mullite and 11.6 g aluminium powder, with \n\naddition of 6.9 g phenolic resin, and sieved in 200 #mesh. All samples \n\nwere weighted (2 g) prior to feeding the compaction mould. Those \n\nsamples are described in Table 1: \n\n \nTable 1 - Experimental plan for porosity measurement. \n\nMethod Variation \n\nArchimedes 50 wt.% solid content 60 wt.% solid content \n\nGeometrical Without resin 50 (WOR50) \n\nand 200 MPa (WOR200) \n\nWith resin 50MPa \n\n(WR50) \n\n \n\nFor measuring the samples weight a balance with a 0.001 g resolution \n\nwas used (R200D, Sartorius). The theoretical density was obtained by \n\ncalculating the density of a solid with 80 wt.% mullite and 20 wt.% \n\nalumina using the rule of mixture, considering  the theoretical density of \n\neach component. \n\n \n\n3.7 LINEAR SHRINKAGE  \n\nFor the linear shrinkage determination, the same features applied in \n\ngeometrical porosity measurement were used, i.e. monolithic bars with \n\nand without resin and pressed either with 50 MPa or 200MPa. The initial \n\ndimensions of the samples are presented in the Table 2. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n\n\n\n35 \n\nTable 2 - Experimental plan for linear shrinkage measurement. \n\nSamples Dimensions (LxWxH) [mm] \n\nWithout Resin 50 MPa (WOR50)  47.2x6.7x4.6 \n\nWithout Resin 200 MPa (WOR200) 42.2x6.7x3.8 \n\nWith Resin 50 MPa (WR50) 47.2x6.7x4.4 \n\n \n\nThe largest dimension (length) was considered to determine the linear \n\nshrinkage. Then 30 samples of each group were prepared and underwent \n\na two-stage thermal treatment. The length of the samples was measured \n\nafter oxidation for both groups and after every thermal treatment for the \n\ngroup with resin.  \n\n \n\n3.8 DENSITY  \n\nFor density determination the samples had the same configuration used \n\nfor the linear shrinkage. Nevertheless, only 10 samples were considered \n\nfor measuring density, which was performed geometrically. \n\n \n\n3.9 MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF MATRIX AND COMPOSITE \n\nFor the mechanical test of the matrix material bars with same \n\ncharacteristics used for linear shrinkage determination, were applied. In \n\nthis case, 30 bars were considered. The mechanical tests were done \n\naccording to the ASTM C1161 \u2013 02c and 1341 - 00 standards (ASTM - \n\nC 1341 - 00, 2003)(ASTM - C 1161 - 02C, 2003).  Considering the \n\nsamples dimensions, the used rate in the test was 2mm/min. For \n\nmeasuring the flexural load, a universal testing machine (ATS, model \n\n27-z-0007-D96) was used (see Figure 17). \n\n\n\n36 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 17 - Apparatus for measuring the flexural strength. \n\n \n\nA four-point flexural mechanical testing set was applied, with a span of \n\n20 mm and a bearing roller with 4 mm diameter. The bearing roller was \n\nfixed with the help of magnets to ensure a degree of freedom for the \n\ntested samples during test. In Figure 17 the magnets are the squared \n\nplates right on side of the bearing roller, in accordance with ASTM \n\nC1161 \u2013 02c and 1341 - 00. A Weibull approach was fitted to the \n\nstrength results in order to determine the mechanical properties of each \n\ngroup. \n\nAdditionally, the mechanical behaviour of a composite panel produced \n\nfrom 720\u2122 Nextel fibre fabric woven was evaluated using the same \n\ntesting set, with dimensions according to ASTM C1161 and 1341. The \n\npanel configuration corresponded to eight infiltrated layers of fibre \n\nfabrics with 45x6x3mm (LxWxH, respectively). \n\n \n\n3.10 MICROSTRUCTURAL ANALYSES \n\nThe microstructure was examined by scanning electron microscopy \n\n(SEM, Philips XL 30, FEI CO.; JEOL JSM-6390LV), field emission gun \n\nscanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Leo Gemini 1530) and optical \n\nmicroscopy (OM, Aristomet) with a CCD camera.  \n\n\n\n37 \n\nFirst characterizations were carried out for samples taken out of the \n\ncomposite panel with the aim of evaluating the flaw density after \n\nthermal treatment cycles. Those images were also considered for \n\nevaluation of fibre surface quality after thermal treatment. Additionally, \n\nthree groups of matrix samples were considered. Those samples were \n\nanalogue to those used in the linear shrinkage with some additional \n\ncompaction pressure values, i.e. without resin, pressed at 25, 50, 75 100 \n\nand 200 MPa and with resin, at 50 MPa. The microstructure of the \n\ncomposite panel was also evaluated in SEM and OM. SEM images in SE \n\n(secondary electron detection) were considered under several \n\nmagnifications. \n\n \n\n3.11 OXIDATION KINETICS \n\nThe oxidation kinetics was evaluated in order to determine the activation \n\nenergy for the oxidation of aluminium carbide. In this context, two \n\nexperiments were suggested. The first one is related to the oxidation \n\nkinetic of the aluminium carbide with a mixture of 50 wt.% mullite and \n\naluminium powder with the stoichiometric amount of resin to provide \n\ncarbon for the carbide formation. This mixture underwent the reaction \n\nthermal treatment proposed in this work without the oxidation thermal \n\ntreatment to produce a mixture with non-oxidized carbide. This powder \n\nmixture was then submitted to a TG analysis in isothermal dwells at \n\n600\u00b0C to 1200\u00b0C, with a heating time schedule of 1h up to the dwelling \n\ntemperature.  \n\nThe second experiment was the determination of the apparent activation \n\nenergy of oxidation process of a commercially available aluminium \n\ncarbide powder (Aluminium Carbide 99%, Sigma Aldrich, 325#mesh). \n\nIn this context, the commercial powder underwent the same test \n\nconfiguration of the first experiment.  \n\nPrior to these evaluations, two different samples were submitted to a \n\nDTA/TG analysis in order to qualitatively evaluate the oxidation \n\nkinetics. The difference between those samples was the presence of \n\ncarbide phase. They consisted of 50/50% mullite/aluminium; in the case \n\nof carbide phase then phenolic resin was added to the mixture and it \n\nunderwent the reaction thermal treatment. Therefore, this experiment \n\nwas planned to evaluate the oxidation kinetics of aluminium and \n\naluminium carbide powder in a qualitative way.  \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n38 \n\n \n\n4 RESULTS  \n\nThe presentation of results was organized according to fabrication \n\nprocess steps, i.e., powder preparation, panel production, thermal \n\ntreatment and characterization. All results are first presented and then \n\ndiscussed at the end of the section. \n\n \n\n4.1 POWDER PREPARATION  \n\nFigure 18 presents the evolution of the particle size as the milling time \n\nincreases. \n\n \n\nFigure 18 - Evolution of the mean particle size according to milling time. \n\n \n\nThe presented curves show different particle sizes. According to the \n\nliterature for reaction bonding processes, mean particle sizes, i.e. d50, \n\nlower than 2 ?m are acceptable for producing final parts without flaws \n\narising from the thermal treatment. The milling time from the mixture \n\nused in this work was, therefore, fixed in 7 h. \n\n \n\n4.2 VISCOSITY  \n\nThe slurry viscosity variation regarding the dispersant agent is presented \n\nin Figure 19, for a fixed shear rate of 400s\n-1\n\n. \n\n \n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n d\n\n90\n\n d\n50\n\n d\n10\n\nP\na\nrt\n\nic\nle\n\n S\niz\n\ne\n (\n?\n\nm\n)\n\nMilling time (h)\n\n4 5 6 7\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n\n\n39 \n\n \n\nFigure 19 - Slurry viscosity as a function of the dispersant amount. \n\n \n\nThe viscosity presents a minimum value at 0.6 wt.% dispersant with \n\nregard to the solid weight percentage.

The rheopexic behaviour found may be associated \n\nwith the time it dwelled at 500s\n-1\n\n, which may have caused the slurry to \n\ndry, since ethanol was the solvent. The slurry viscosity presented values \n\nof 6.31\u00b1 0.77 mPa.s which can be verified in the black curve of Figure \n\n20.  \n\nThe second step of characterization was the slurry viscosity variation \n\nwith regard to the solid content (Figure 21).

This is a \n\nreasonable value when compared to literature values for similar \n\nsuspensions of ceramic particles with similar shapes (RAHAMAN, \n\n2003). The intrinsic viscosity found was 2.8 Pa.s, which is also related to \n\nspherical particles (RAHAMAN, 2003).  \n\nConcerning the results in this section, the set points for producing a \n\nstable suspension of the raw material mixture with addition of phenolic \n\nresin in ethanol were: \n\n? 0.6 wt.% phosphate ester dispersant; \n\n? 45 wt.% solid content slurry. \nSome slurries were then produced, in which fibre fabric woven were \n\ninfiltrated and composite panel were produced. To produce composite \n\npanels using phenolic resin for both prepreg consolidation and for \n\ncarbon source to the carbide reaction, this resin was applied to the \n\nslurries. Although the slurry exhibited enough stability for going through \n\nthe infiltration process without any phase segregation or precipitation, \n\nthe slurry presented neither high solid content nor low viscosity. Those \n\nproperties are required for a desirable fibre fabric woven infiltration and \n\ncomposite panel production, which means composites with desired \n\nmechanical strength. Lower viscosity, i.e. 50mPa.s, and higher solid \n\ncontent, i.e. approximately 45 vol. %, or ~80 wt.%, are desirable slurry \n\nproperties for fibre fabric woven infiltration (MACHRY, \n\n2010),(WAMSER, 2010).  \n\nIn order to evaluate the slurry properties with the phenolic resin \n\nreplacement, an evaluation of the slurry viscosity with graphite powder \n\nwas carried out. According to the results of Figure 22, which are \n\nsummarized in Table 4, the application of graphite as an alternative \n\nsource for carbon to be used in the carbide reaction is a promising way \n\nfor lowering the slurry viscosity. Detrimentally, the composite route \n\nproduction might lose the potential for producing prepregs with enough \n\ngreen handling strength, once the phenolic resin is not only the carbon \n\nsource, but also it consolidates the infiltrated fabric woven by solvent \n\ndrying. Nonetheless, small additions of phenolic resin for this purpose \n\nmay not harm the low viscosity of the slurry, which was achieved with \n\nthe application of the graphite powder. Consequently, a combination of \ngraphite powder with small contents of phenolic resin is suggested. \n\nTherefore, a mixture combining 3 g graphite powder and 0.7 g phenolic \n\nresin might be used in order to produce a slurry, which not only presents \n\nlow viscosity, but can also consolidates the fibre fabrics into prepregs. \n\n\n\n44 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.3 THERMAL TREATMENT  \n\nFigure 23 presents DTA/TG analyses of phenolic resin in an inert \n\natmosphere (Argon). \n\n  \n\nFigure 23 - DTA/TG analysis of phenolic resin in an inert atmosphere. \n\n \n\nNovolac-Type phenolic resins are normally used in applications which \n\nrequire high amounts of residual carbon after pyrolysis. The 1\nst\n \n\nderivative curve of the TG analysis shows a sharp peak at a ~500\u00b0C and \n\na smaller peak at ~400\u00b0C. This sample presented a residual carbon \n\namount of 55% (last point of TG blue curve). The first dwell \n\ntemperature was considered as 400\u00b0C, followed by another dwell \n\ntemperature at 500\u00b0C. \n\nFigure 24 presents DTA/TG analyses of raw materials mixture in an \n\ninert atmosphere. \n\n \n\n/ \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n DTA\n\n 1\nst\n derivative of TG\n\n TG\n\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n\nD\nT\n\nA\n (\n\nu\nV\n\n/m\ng\n\n)\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n T\nG\n\n (%\n)\n\n\n\n45 \n\n \n\nFigure 24 - DTA/TG analysis of raw materials mixture in inert atmosphere. \n\n \n\nThe 1\nst\n derivative curve of TG analysis shows a peak in the same \n\ntemperature range of that presented in Figure 23, although in a smaller \n\nintensity. It is associated with the available pyrolysing material which is \n\nlosing mass. The reason behind this analysis was to evaluate whether the \n\nresin with the mixture of raw material would behave the same way it did \n\nnon-combined . This hypothesis was confirmed by the presence of the \n\npeak in the same temperature range. Moreover, in this TG curve, no \n\nweight change regarding to oxidation of the metallic aluminium powder \n\nwas observed due to the non-oxidizing atmosphere.  \n\nFigure 25 presents XRD analysis of raw materials mixture after thermal \n\ntreatment.  \n\n \n\n \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2  DTA\n\n 1\nst\n derivative of TG\n\n TG\n\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n\nD\nT\n\nA\n (\n\nu\nV\n\n/m\ng\n\n)\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\nT\n\nG\n (%\n\n)\n\n\n\n46 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 25 - XRD after reaction thermal treatment, with stoichiometric and \n\n50%mol excess resin content. \n\n \n\nThis figure shows results of two distinct samples.

Considering the sample \n\ncomposition, those two features are associated to the oxidation of the \n\nmetallic aluminium powder, since in this analysis, there was neither the \n\nreaction thermal treatment nor the resin content in the mixture, and \n\ntherefore no carbide reaction could have taken place. Therefore, the \n\nsingle available component for oxidation reaction was the aluminium \n\npowder. Moreover, the presented curves are consistent with the available \n\nRBAO literature data: not only the extremely defined peak in the DTA \n\ncurve at 600\u00b0C, but also the weight gain in two steps depicted in the TG \n\ncurve. \n\nThe DTA/TG of raw material mixture with resin result is then presented \n\nin Figure 28. \n\n0 200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600\n-0.4\n\n-0.3\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n DTA\n\n TG\n\nTemperature (\u00b0C)\n\nD\nT\n\nA\n (\n\nu\nV\n\n/m\ng\n)\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nT\nG\n\n (%\n)\n\n\n\n49 \n\n  \n\nFigure 28 - DTA/TG analysis of raw materials mixture with resin in \n\noxidizing atmosphere. \n\n \n\nThe TG curve presents weight loss in the temperature range of 300-\n\n500\u00b0C, associated to the pyrolysis of resin and consistent with the \n\ntemperature range of weight loss presented in Figure 23.

Laboratory air provided the oxidising atmosphere \n\ncharacteristic. \n\nRegarding the presented results of this section, the set points for the \n\nthermal treatment are presented in Figure 26 and Figure 31. Rates of 1.5 \n\nand 2.5\u00b0C/min, the heating rate until the first and second dwell time, \n\nrespectively, were selected in order to prevent excessive degassing \n\nformation, so that the material presents neither collapse nor crack \n\nformation and therefore enabling the formation of low flaw density, \n\nwhich is a prerequisite for the suggested novel route production. \n\nConsidering the reaction thermal treatment set points, the first dwelling \n\ntemperature was selected in order to give time for gases, which originate \n\nfrom phenolic resin pyrolysis, to flow out from the internal \n\nmicrostructure without causing flaws to the sample. The second dwelling \n\ntemperature was selected in order to give time so the carbide reaction \n\ncan occur. According to Wang and co-workers the maximum DSC peak \n\nof aluminium carbide occurs at 975\u00b0C; therefore, it was the second fixed \n\ndwelling temperature (WANG, et al., 2004). The last dwelling \n\ntemperature was constrained from the maximum temperature, wherein \n\n0 5 10 15 20\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nOxidising atmosphere\n\n1\nst\n carbide\n\noxidation\n\nCarbon\n\nOxidation\n\n2.5\u00b0C/min\n\n    975\u00b0C/2h\n\nT\ne\nm\n\np\ne\nra\n\ntu\nre\n\n (\n\u00b0C\n\n)\n\nTime (hour)\n\n Temperature\n\n1.5\u00b0C/min\n\n    500\u00b0C/2h\n\n2.5\u00b0C/min\n\n    1200\u00b0C/2h\n\n           Final \n\noxidation/sintering\n\n\n\n53 \n\nthe fibres have its internal microstructures modified, i.e. grain-growth or \n\nphase segregation (GOUSHEGIR, et al., 2012).  \n\nConsidering the oxidation thermal treatment set points, the first dwelling \n\ntemperature was selected in order to give time for gases resulted from \n\ncarbon pyrolysis, to flow out from the internal microstructure without \n\ncausing internal flaws. The second dwelling temperature was selected in \n\norder to give time for the carbide oxidation to occur. In Figure 57, the \n\nDTA curve of mullite Al4C3, i.e., black curve with open square symbol, \n\na wide peak, which has a maximum at ~950\u00b0C, is associated to the \n\naluminium carbide oxidation. The second dwelling point was therefore \n\nfixed, for convenience, at the second dwelling temperature of the \n\nreaction thermal treatment, i.e., 975\u00b0C. The last dwelling temperature is \n\n1200\u00b0C and it is constrained from the maximum temperature. \n\nIn Figure 29, the top curve presents the XRD pattern of a sample after all \n\nthermal treatments. The present phases are only mullite and alumina, \n\nwhat confirms that is possible to achieve a final mixture of phases \n\nconsisting of mullite and alumina, with an intermediate carbide phase.  \n\n \n\n4.4 FIBRE FABRIC WOVEN INFILTRATION  \n\nFor producing composite panel slurries with resin, mullite and 45 wt.% \n\naluminium powder were used for infiltrating the fabric woven with \n\nprecursors of the matrix material. The infiltration process can be \n\nillustrated in the flowchart presented in Figure 32 \n\n\n\n54 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 32 - Flowchart of infiltration - and thermal treatment processes. \n\nAfter infiltrating fibre fabric woven with slurry and pilling them up in \n\nstacks, the prepreg panel was produced, presenting a greyish colour due \n\nto the amount of aluminium powder within the mixture. An example of \n\nprepreg panel is shown in Figure 33. \n\nDry powder \u2013 Resin \n\nEthanol \u2013 Dispersant \n\nSlurry \n\nSlurry \u2013 Fabric woven \n\nPrepreg panel \n\nAl powder - \n\nMullite \nAcetone \n\nMixture of milled powder \n\n7h - Attritor \n\nDry - sieving \n\n10\u201d U.S. Probe \n\nDip coating + vacuum \n\ndrying \n\nReaction  \n\nThermal treatment \n\nReacted part \nOxidation Thermal \n\ntreatment \n\nOxidized and sinterized \n\ncomposite panel \n\n\n\n55 \n\n \n\nFigure 33 - Infiltrated prepreg panel. \n\n \n\nThe sample is just dried and, due to the resin content, it presents strength \n\nenough for dry cutting in the required dimensions. Afterwards, the \n\nprepreg underwent the two-stage thermal treatment (Figure 26 and \n\nFigure 31). Right after this treatment, the sample presented dark colour, \n\nassociated to the pyrolysed resin. In this thermal treatment, inert \n\natmosphere was assured by pressurizing Argon at 1 bar inside the \n\nfurnace tube. If any connection of the gas tubes or even the tube tap \n\nwould have presented any leakage, then any oxygen/oxidant gas from \n\noutside would not be able to enter within the tube due to its internal \n\nhigher pressure. After the reaction thermal treatment, then the reacted \n\ncomposite panel underwent the oxidation thermal cycles in a muffle \n\nfurnace. In this process, oxidizing atmosphere ensured the oxidation \n\nreaction of the newly formed intermediate carbide phase in order to \n\nproduce the final ceramic oxide phase, i.e. alumina. Inside the muffle, \n\nthe samples were carefully placed over ceramic foams to ensure a \n\nflowing path for the oxygen required in the oxidation reaction. Ceramic \n\nbricks were also used to place samples in a region of the muffle with \n\nmore homogenous temperature distribution and higher access for the \n\noxygen to reach the sample.  \nAfter finishing this last thermal treatment, the sample presented a \n\nwhitish colour (Figure 34) due to the content of oxide ceramic, i.e. \n\nmullite and alumina. \n\n           10mm \n\n\n\n56 \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 34 - Composite panel after oxidation TT. \n\n \n\n4.5 POROSITY \n\nThe results of the two experiment methods for porosity determination \n\nare presented in Table 5. \n\n \nTable 5 - Matrix porosity values. \n\nSamples Porosity [%] \n\n Green Reacted Sintered \n\nDried 50 wt.%  - - 56.5\u00b10.5 \n\nDried 60 wt.% - - 56.6\u00b10.7 \n\nWithout Resin 200 MPa \n\n(WOR200) \n\n- - 31.7\u00b10.5 \n\nWithout Resin 50 MPa \n\n(WOR50) \n\n- - 53.4\u00b10.4 \n\nWith Resin 50 MPa \n\n(WR50) \n\n52.8\u00b10.4 54.0\u00b10.7 50.9\u00b11 \n\n \nThe values of  porosities obtained from Archimedes\u2019 principle, i.e., dried \n\n50% and 60%, are very similar. Pressed samples, i.e., WOR200 and 50 \n\nand WR50, presented porosity more consistent with the compaction \n\npressure. The sample with compaction pressure of 200 MPa presented \n\nlower porosity than samples compacted at 50MPa. This is expected, but \n\n             10mm \n\n\n\n57 \n\nwhen samples pressed with 50 MPa are compared, then samples which \n\nhave resin addition in their composition presented lower porosity values. \n\nIn this case, resin also acts as a lubricant and provides better compaction \n\nof raw materials. Nevertheless, the difference between the porosities is \n\nwithin the range of the  standard deviation. Other important \n\ncharacteristic is the stable porosity value along the thermal treatment \n\ncycle. It started with 53%, changed to 54% and finished with 51%, \n\nwhich gives a final change of approximately two percentage points. \n\n \n\n4.6 LINEAR SHRINKAGE \n\nThe results for linear shrinkage of pressed samples are presented in \n\nTable 6. \n\n \nTable 6 -Matrix linear shrinkage values. \n\nSamples Linear shrinkage [%] \n\n Reacted Sintered Sum \n\nWithout Resin 200 \n\nMPa (WOR200) \n\n- -0.27\u00b10.12 -0.27\u00b10.12 \n\nWithout Resin 50 \n\nMPa (WOR50) \n\n- -0.55\u00b10.1 -0.55\u00b10.1 \n\nWith Resin 50 MPa \n\n(WR50) \n\n-1.71\u00b10.1 -0.39\u00b10.06 2.1\u00b10.1 \n\n \n\nFrom those densities all porosity values were calculated with respect to \n\nthe theoretical density of a mixture of 80% mullite and 20% alumina, \n\ni.e., 3.21 g/cm\u00b3.

The first \n\ncharacterization was carried out with square cross section bars of the \n\nmatrix material after it underwent the two-stage thermal treatment and \n\nthe polishing process. In order to evaluate the effect of the compacting \n\npressure on mechanical properties of the matrix, Weibull analysis was \n\nundertaken on the results from the four-point bending test. Figure 35 \n\npresents the Weibull analysis of the mechanical test carried out with bars \n\nof WOR50 and WOR200 and WR50. This figure presents values of \n\n                                in abscissa axis and natural \nlogarithm of ultimate flexural stress values in ordinate axis.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n59 \n\n \n\nFigure 35 - Weibull analyses of matrix samples. \n\n \n\nIn Figure 35 all set of results present similar values of curve slope, i.e. \n\nWeibull parameter m, which was ~10.5. Samples without resin presented \n\nthe higher and the lower set of mechanical strength, and the samples \n\nwith resin presented higher values than the WOR50 samples, which \n\nwere compacted at the same pressure, i.e., 50MPa, and lower values than \n\nWOR200, pressed at higher pressure, i.e., 200MPa.

Although this data corresponded to a damage \n\ntolerant behaviour, the ultimate flexural strength is lower than the \n\nexpected, ~200 MPa(RUGGLES-WRENN, et al., 2006)(RUGGLES-\n\nWRENN, et al., 2008), which implies that more development in the \ninfiltration process in order to get better composites is yet demanded. \n\nAccording to the Weibull fitting, which is presented in Figure 35, the \n\nsamples without resin pressed at 200 MPa presented higher ?0 than the \n\nsamples with resin pressed at 50 MPa, which showed in turn higher ?0 \n\nthan the samples without resin pressed at 50MPa. This may be \n\nassociated to the presence of sintering characteristics in samples WR50 \n\nin comparison to the samples WOR50 (cf. Figures of WR50 samples, i.e. \n\nFigure 38 a) and b), with Figures of WOR50 samples, i.e. Figure 42a) \n\nand b); Figure 41 and Figure 47). \n\nAlthough WR and WOR samples presented dissimilar ?0, they showed \n\nWeibull parameters m with similar values.

On the other hand, in a comparison to 75 and 25 MPa \n\nsamples, the 75 MPa samples showed denser microstructure with grains \n\nmore evident. The densest samples were those compacted at 100 MPa.  \n\nIn Figure 41 to Figure 43, SEM images, the samples were the same used \n\nin mechanical test, i.e., WR50 and WOR50 and 200.

Although the thermal treatment involves two kinds of \n\nreaction, i.e. carbide formation and oxidation reaction, the process does \n\nnot affect the fibres and therefore it does not harm their properties. \n\nMoreover, a recent work pointed out a maximum temperature, i.e. \n\n1300\u00b0C, wherein fibre grains do not coalesce (GOUSHEGIR, et al., \n2012). A batch consisting of the same raw material mixture but with \n\ndifferent particle sizes was prepared so that the phase could be visually \n\nidentified due to the bigger mullite particle size and smaller alumina \n\nnewly formed phase. The samples of this batch are presented in Figure \n\n49. \n\n \n\nFigure 49 - Samples visual aspect: (a) as processed (b) reacted in inert \n\natmosphere at 1200\u00b0C (c) oxidized at 1200\u00b0C. \n\n \n\nThe green body presented gray coloration due to the amount of \n\naluminium powder added as raw material (Figure 49a). The strength of \n\ngreen body was high enough to allow handling and cutting. The dark \n\naspect of the reacted samples (Figure 49b) refers to the carbon originated \n\nduring the carbonization step. The oxidized sample presented an external \n\nregion where oxidation took place while the inner region preserved the \n\nreacted composition (i.e. aluminium carbide). It remained unreacted due \n\nto the small dwell period (Figure 49c).

After oxidation thermal treatment, the oxidized region presented \n\na microstructure where coarse mullite particles are homogeneously \n\ndistributed in microstructure surrounded by a finer particulate (Figure \n\n52a and b). The interface between reacted/oxidized phases was displayed \n\nin a single image to evaluate the microstructure differences. It can \n\nclearly be seen that in the oxidized region finer particles are present (see \n\nFigure 53). The particles of the reacted region without carbon content, \n\ni.e. yellow brown in Figure 49, are coarser but exhibit a different \n\nmicrostructure from the green body (see Figure 54a and b).

Mass contrast information is useful in order to observe \n\nthat the inner particle composition is different from the outer shell layer. \n\nIn this context, one can associate this different composition with the \n\nformation of an outer shell of alumina, although it was not evaluated in \n\nthis study.

The first type of sample consisted of a mixture of \n\nmullite and aluminium and the second type of sample consisted of a \n\nmixture of mullite and aluminium carbide, the one produced from the \n\ntwo-stage thermal treatment suggested in this work. Figure 57 presents \n\nDTA/TG analyses of aluminium and aluminium carbide samples for \n\nevaluation in oxidizing atmosphere. \n\n \n\nFigure 57 - DTA/TG analysis of RBMAO precursor mixture with samples \n\nreacted and not reacted. \n\n \n\nCurves of both samples have dissimilar behaviour both for TG and DTA \n\nevaluation. In TG resulted curve for sample which contains aluminium \n\ncarbide, it presents a single region of weight gain, which takes place in \n\nthe range from approximately 650\u00b0C to 950\u00b0C with subsequent weight \n\nloss, resulted from oxidation of some residual carbon which was not \n\ncompletely reacted with the aluminium powder. In TG resulted curve for \n\nsample which contains aluminium powder, it presents the already \n\npresented oxidation behaviour of this type of material. In DTA resulted \n\ncurve for sample which contains aluminium carbide, it presents a wide \n\nexothermal peak in temperature range from approximately 600\u00b0C to \n\n1200\u00b0C.

Therefore, in qualitative terms it is possible to state \n\nthat aluminium and aluminium carbide powder possess dissimilar \n\noxidation behaviour. In order to get more quantitative terms information \n\nof this difference, then mass gain evaluations experiments of those two \n\nmaterials were carried out. \n\nAn overlap of Figure 23 and Figure 27 results in Figure 30 and \n\ncomparing the latest with the curve of the samples consisting of mullite \n\nand carbide, i.e. Figure 57, it is evident that those samples are dissimilar \n\nregarding their TG profile behaviour. Since the TG profile behaviour of \n\nFigure 57 is associated with the carbide oxidation TG profile, then it \n\nmight be concluded that without the reaction thermal treatment it is not \n\npossible to produce the intermediate carbide phase. It is worthy \n\nreminding that Figure 30 is an evaluation wherein samples consisted of \n\nmullite, aluminium powder and resin. A result of this observation \n\nimplies that if the simple heating of the raw material might produce the \n\nintermediate carbide phase, then in this evaluation, i.e. Figure 30, the TG \n\nprofiles should present same TG profile associated with the carbide \n\noxidation, i.e. Figure 57, which was not the observed behaviour. \n\nFigure 58 present weight gain of commercially available aluminium \n\ncarbide powder yielded from different temperature range of isothermal \n\nmass gain.  \n\n \n\nFigure 58 - Weight gain along the time for commercial Al4C3 - Aldrich\n\u00ae\n. \n\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\n?\nW\n\n/A\n (\n\n%\n)\n\nTime (min)\n\n 1200\n\n 1000\n\n 900\n\n 800\n\n 600\n\n\n\n86 \n\n \n\nThe parabolic trend present in these curves, for which the rate is \n\ninversely proportional to the square root of time, is found to be obeyed \n\nwhen diffusion through the scale is the rate-determining process.

This observation infers that aluminium \n\ncarbide presents a feature that it is not easily oxidized at lower \n\ntemperatures but it is easily oxidized at higher temperatures. In \n\ncomparison with metallic aluminium particle, it presents an oxidation \n\nreaction in narrow first range of temperature, as showed in Figure 27, \n\nwherein the aluminium particles oxidize in temperature range from \n\n550\u00b0C to 600\u00b0C, and finish its oxidation reaction in a second wider \n\nrange of temperature, wherein the aluminium particles oxidize in \n\ntemperature range from 750\u00b0C to 900\u00b0C. The apparent activation energy \n\nof oxidation of metallic aluminium powder is found to be placed in a \n\nrange of 112-152 kJ/mol for temperatures lower 660\u00b0C, and 26-33 \n\nkJ/mol for temperature above 660\u00b0C (WU, et al., 1993). \nBecause the carbide oxidation is kind of a shifting reaction, then it \n\npresents a slower rate reaction in comparison with the direct oxidation. \n\nA general aluminium carbide oxidation is expressed in equation 7  \n\n                     \n7 \n\n\n\n92 \n\n \n\nwhere Greek letters and \u201cx\u201d leave place for the variations in such kind of \n\nreaction, which is not the focus of this discussion.  \n\nA general metallic aluminium is expressed in equation 8. \n\n               \n8 \n\nAccording to the equations 7 and 8, carbide oxidation demands a shift \n\nreaction between the \u201cC\u201d positions with the oxygen specimens in order \n\nto form the oxide, nonetheless, in the metallic oxidation these shifts are \n\nnot required. This shift behaviour may be, therefore, addressed to the \n\nhigher apparent activation energy of oxidation of the carbide phase.  \n\nThe presented oxidation behaviour of the aluminium carbide has a \n\npromising application of matrix production route of all-oxide ceramics, \n\ndue to the fact that it oxidizes with low oxidation rates at lower \n\ntemperatures preventing the microstructure to form high flaw density \n\nand at high temperature the oxidation rate increases ensuring the fully \n\noxidation of the carbide phase, which leaves no residual carbide phase to \n\nthe final matrix material. \n\nMoreover, another observation within the results, which corroborates \n\nwith the affirmation that carbide particles oxidize with dissimilar \n\nbehaviour of the metallic particles, is the oxidation profile behaviour \n\npresented in Figure 57. In this figure, aluminium particles oxidize in a \n\ntwo-stage process, wherein the first step is featured with a very high \n\nexothermal reaction followed by a wider peak exothermal reaction, and \n\naluminium carbide oxidized in a single stage oxidation, wherein the \n\noxidation step is featured with a very wider exothermal peak. Those two \n\nbehaviours promote dissimilar heat load to the neighbourhood of the \n\nparticles. Since the metallic particles have very exothermal oxidation \n\nreaction, they generate localized temperatures up to 2000\u00b0K, which may \n\nbe responsible for increasing the flaw density formation. The oxidation \n\nreaction of the carbide particle presents a wider peak, and then the \n\nlocalized temperatures are lower in comparison with the first mentioned. \n\nAdditionally, the temperature, where the transition of the apparent \n\nactivation energy of oxidation occurs, was observed at 900\u00b0C for the \n\ncommercially available aluminium carbide and at 800\u00b0C for the \n\nRBMAO produced aluminium carbide. This behaviour may be \n\nassociated to the mullite content, which can act as oxygen donor for the \n\noxidation reaction and therefore improving the diffusion of the oxygen \n\nsupply for the reaction. \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n93 \n\n5 DISCUSSION  \n\nThis thesis focused mainly on the feasibility of the RBMAO as an \n\nalternative route for production of porous materials. Discussions are \n\npresented in this section in order to better understand this novel route in \n\nits fundamental aspects.  \n\n \n\n5.1 SLURRY RHEOLOGY \n\nAs a concluding remark of section 4.2, in page 38, the usage of phenolic \n\nresin is at same time beneficial and detrimental. Its usage is \n\nadvantageous due to its potential of yielding high residual carbon after \n\npyrolysis and producing prepregs with enough green handling strength. \n\nHowever, it is detrimental due to its characteristic of form organized \n\nstructure between the resin and the raw material particles, which results \n\nin increasing viscosity. Alternatively, the replacement of most phenolic \n\nresin by graphite powder is a promising way to keep the slurry within \n\nthe desired features for using in composite panel production.  \n\n \n\n5.2 THERMAL TREATMENT \n\nAs a concluding remark in section 4.3, in page 44, the two-stage thermal \n\ntreatment proved its necessity to be performed in two steps. In this way, \n\nthe reaction thermal treatment produces the intermediate carbide phase \n\nand the oxidation thermal treatment oxidizes subsequently this carbide \n\nphase. Therefore, the two-stage thermal treatment enables the production \n\nof the final oxide ceramic phase through and intermediate carbide phase, \n\nwhich will be discussed further in section 5.4 the importance its \n\napplication. \n\n \n\n5.3 MECHANICAL STRENGTH  \n\nAs concluding remarks in section 4.8, in page 58, the RBMAO can be \n\nclassified in the same reliable category of the RBAO process, due to its \n\nWeibull parameter similarity the last mentioned group. Moreover, in \n\ncomparison of samples same compaction setup, the RBMAO samples \n\npresented higher strength than the adapted RBAO samples. \n\n \n5.4 OXIDATION KINETICS \n\nAs a concluding remark in section 4.10, in page 84, the usage of the \n\nintermediate phase is justified due to the lower oxidation rate at lower \n\ntemperatures, which contributes with the lower formation of flaw \n\n\n\n94 \n\n \n\ndensity, and the increasing of the oxidation rate at higher temperature, \n\nwhich ensures complete carbide oxidation. \n\n  \n\n\n\n95 \n\n6 CONCLUSION \n\nA summary of the concluding remarks is: \n\n? According to the presented features of the RBMAO novel route \nand to the particular requirements for composite production, \n\nhence the route can be considered successfully developed. \n\n? The use of phosphate ester as dispersant for such slurry is a \npromising alternative; \n\n? The replacement of the phenolic resin by graphite powder \nproduces a sensible viscosity decreasing, which allows the solid \n\ncontent to increase up to 47 vol. % without crossing the \n\nviscosity value of 50 MPa.s; \n\n? The application of DTA/TG analyses for the thermal treatment \nset points was as promising tool. The two-stage thermal \n\ntreatment was properly proposed and after analysis of present \n\nfinal phases, then the two-stage thermal treatment can be \n\nconsidered successfully developed, since it promoted the \n\nformation of the intermediate carbide phase and the final oxide \n\nceramic phase; \n\n? The ceramic matrix mechanical properties were evaluated and \nWeibull parameter was determined, i.e., 10.54, and ?0 , i.e. \n\n14,15 MPa, with ?max, i.e. 16.1 MPa, which are placed in \n\nbetween the group of WOR50 and WOR200. This mechanical \n\nbehaviour is addressed with the more evident sintering features \n\npresented by the WR50 samples.  \n\n? The observation of the SEM and FE-SEM images of the \ncomposite panel cross section shown a microstructure with low \n\nflaw density. \n\n? Further viscosity evaluations are required for producing slurry \nwith correct parameters to be used for infiltration process of the \n\nfibres bundles. \n\n? Kinetics parameters of commercially available and RBMAO \nprocess produced Al4C3 were determined. It was found a two \n\nregimes oxidation kinetics for Aldrich\u2122 Al4C3 and three \n\nregimes for RBMAO Al4C3, wherein oxidizes with lower rates \n\nat lower temperature in comparison with the metallic particle \nand oxidizes with high rates at higher temperatures, which \n\nensure the total oxidation of the carbide yielding in an entirely \n\noxidizes ceramic phase.  \n\n\n\n96 \n\n \n\n? The novel ceramic production route for application in porous \nmatrix of all-oxide ceramic composite was suggested and \n\nproven as a promising alternative. \n\n? RBMAO presents dissimilar features in comparison with other \nreaction bonding techniques due to two facts, first of all, it \n\nproduced an intermediate phase and second due to the directly \n\naddition of mullite within the raw materials. \n\n  \n\n\n\n97 \n\n7 SUGGESTION FOR FUTURE WORK \n\n \n\n7.1 IDEAL VISCOSITY FOR FIBRE FABRIC WOVEN INFILTRATION: \n\nAlthough the main target of this work was to develop a route for all-\n\noxide composites matrix production, which was successfully achieved, \n\nthe proper composite panel was not produced due to the slurry viscosity \n\ncharacteristic. Nevertheless, some interim results in this field bring up \n\nsome possibilities for solving the high viscosity problem, which \n\ncomprised the replacement of the major amount of  phenolic resin by \n\ngraphite powder. Additionally, for the resin it is in charge not only to \n\nsupply carbon, but also to consolidate the prepregs. It was also suggested \n\nthat the addition of small part of phenolic resin may enable prepregs \n\nconsolidation. In order to produce a proper composite panel, therefore, \n\nmore infiltrations experiments applying the modified slurry are yet \n\nrequired.  \n\n \n\n7.2 POROUS WICK STRUCTURES FOR CAPILLARY EVAPORATORS \n\nThe technique may be adapted for production of porous wicks structure \n\nto be used in capillary evaporators. The parts produced out from the \n\nRBMAO exhibit desirable mechanical strength for the particular \n\napplication and may be pressed in order to manufacture flat cylinder \n\nshaped parts, which is suitable for flat capillary evaporators. Researches \n\nin this field are already been undertaken. \n\n  \n\n\n\n98 \n\n \n\n8 LIST OF PUBLICATIONS \n\n \n\n8.1 HT-CMC 7 - 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HIGH \nTEMPERATURE CERAMIC MATRIX COMPOSITES \n\nBERTI, L.F., et al.
