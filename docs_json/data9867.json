THANK!  \n\n\n\n  Resumo \n\nI \n \n\nRESUMO \n\nOs sumidouros de carbono s\u00e3o reservat\u00f3rios naturais ou artificiais, nos quais o  \n\ncarbono pode ser acumulado durante um determinado per\u00edodo de tempo. Mangais, sapais, \n\nsalinas e pradarias marinhas s\u00e3o habitats que t\u00eam um papel importante no balan\u00e7o de \n\ncarbono dos oceanos e, assim, influenciam o ciclo oce\u00e2nico. Eles representam um hotspot \n\nmundial para armazenamento de carbono org\u00e2nico (OC). Estes habitats compartilham uma \n\nparcela excessiva no sequestro de C em rela\u00e7\u00e3o aos habitats terrestres. Este OC pode ser \n\nencontrado na biomassa viva especialmente enterrada nos sedimentos. A acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nOC em sedimentos marinhos fornece armazenamento de C a longo prazo. Esta acumula\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nOC \u00e9 influenciada por alguns par\u00e2metros ambientais, tais como, por exemplo, a dist\u00e2ncia ao \n\ncontinente e/ou o tamanho de gr\u00e3o e pH, assim como o tipo de ambientes de mar\u00e9s.  \n\nDevido \u00e0 falta de dados de deposi\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono na \u00e1rea de estudo e tamb\u00e9m para \n\ndestacar a import\u00e2ncia destes ecossistemas no sequestro de carbono, neste estudo \n\npretendeu-se avaliar \"sumidouros de C\" em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a estes par\u00e2metros ambientais tais \n\ncomo, por exemplo, a hidrodin\u00e2mica marinha relativamente \u00e0 distancia ao continente, ou o \n\nsedimento, relativamente ao tamanho do gr\u00e3o nas diferentes esta\u00e7\u00f5es de amostragem. \n\nAdicionalmente, dois diferentes ecossistemas intertidais da Ria Formosa, Zostera noltii vs \n\nSpartina mar\u00edtima, foram avaliados. Esta abordagem multidisciplinar e integrada inclui \n\nan\u00e1lises biol\u00f3gicas, geol\u00f3gicas e qu\u00edmicas, para melhor compreender os processos que \n\nconduzem \u00e0 acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono, conserva\u00e7\u00e3o ou degrada\u00e7\u00e3o.  \n\nPara tal, foi realizada uma amostragem ao longo de um canal principal e um canal \n\nsecund\u00e1rio da Ria Formosa, em quatro esta\u00e7\u00f5es diferentes, sendo que em cada esta\u00e7\u00e3o os \n\ndois ecossistemas foram amostrados. No laborat\u00f3rio, analis\u00e1mos as caracter\u00edsticas \n\nsedimentol\u00f3gicas, onde foi determinado o tamanho das part\u00edculas por difra\u00e7\u00e3o laser e por \n\nuso de peneiros, com o obejctivo de estimar o n\u00edvel relativo de energia presente no \n\nambiente onde o sedimento foi transportado e depositado. A cor dos sedimentos foi \n\nanalisada em todo o espectro de luz vis\u00edvel por reflect\u00e2ncia difusa, permitindo-nos adquirir \n\numa aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o da composi\u00e7\u00e3o do sedimento. Tamb\u00e9m foi estudada a composi\u00e7\u00e3o \n\nmineral\u00f3gica por difra\u00e7\u00e3o de raios-X. Por outro lado, foram analisadas as caracter\u00edsticas \n\ngeoqu\u00edmicas, o que incluiu a determina\u00e7\u00e3o da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica e carbonato perdidos por \n\n\n\n  Resumo \n\nII \n \n\ncombust\u00e3o, an\u00e1lise de composi\u00e7\u00e3o elementar (OC, IC, IN e ON) atrav\u00e9s de um sistema de \n\ncombust\u00e3o elementar e o raio de C/N foi calculado, para ter uma ideia aproximada da \n\norigem ou fonte da mat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica. Tamb\u00e9m foi determinada a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\npigmentos, onde por um lado foram analisadas as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es de clorofila e caroten\u00f3ides, \n\nusando uma extra\u00e7\u00e3o simples com acetona e medidas as concentra\u00e7\u00f5es atrav\u00e9s do \n\nespectrofot\u00f3metro. Seguidamente, atrav\u00e9s de cromatografia HPLC, foram analisados os \n\npigmentos espec\u00edficos. Os resultados destas \u00faltimas an\u00e1lises foram, no entanto, n\u00e3o \n\nrepresentativos, uma vez que os valores obtidos apresentavam artefactos de degrada\u00e7\u00e3o, \n\nn\u00e3o tendo sido considerados.  \n\nO processamento de dados foi realizado utilizando o software estat\u00edstico R. Todas \n\nas propriedades f\u00edsicas e bioqu\u00edmicas de sedimentos foram avaliadas para cada esta\u00e7\u00e3o e \n\npara cada tipo de habitat, avaliando a sua variabilidade. Um estudo ANOVA de dois \n\nfatores, sendo um de eles \u2018esta\u00e7\u00e3o\u2019 e o outro \u2018tipo de comunidade biol\u00f3gica\u2019, foi aplicado a \n\ncada vari\u00e1vel, de modo a saber se houve ou n\u00e3o diferen\u00e7as significativas dependentes de \n\ncada fator individualmente ou devido ao efeito da interfer\u00eancia de ambos. Nos casos em \n\nque se verificaram diferen\u00e7as, foi usado um post-hoc para determinar a origem da \n\ndiferen\u00e7a, neste caso usamos o teste de Tukey. O software Gradistat, foi utilizado para \n\ncalcular o c\u00e1lculo estat\u00edstico do tamanho de gr\u00e3o.  \n\nNos resultados em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s caracter\u00edsticas sedimentol\u00f3gicas, o tamanho da \n\npart\u00edcula reflete um gradiente em que o tamanho do gr\u00e3o nas amostras diminui \u00e0 medida \n\nque nos afastamos do canal principal e nos aproximamos das esta\u00e7\u00f5es do canal secund\u00e1rio. \n\nEste gradiente \u00e9 mais marcado no caso da Z. noltii do que no da S. maritima. Esta diferen\u00e7a \n\nna intensidade do gradiente entre ambos ambientes pode ser devido \u00e0s diferen\u00e7as de \n\nhidrodinamismo entre os dois meios, uma vez que a Z. noltii est\u00e1 mais exposta que a S. \n\nmaritma devido \u00e0 sua posi\u00e7\u00e3o no intertidal. Relativamente aos resultados de cor, foi \n\nobservada a poss\u00edvel presen\u00e7a de v\u00e1rias formas de Fe e goetita devido aos tons do \n\nsedimento, apresentando um aumento em ambos os valores ou aumentado o conte\u00fado \n\ndessas subst\u00e2ncias da esta\u00e7\u00e3o 1 para a 4 para ambos os ambientes. No composi\u00e7\u00e3o mineral \n\nverificaram-se diferen\u00e7as entre o teor de quartzo e polissilicatos entre as esta\u00e7\u00f5es, \n\naumentando o conte\u00fado de polissilicatos e redu\u00e7\u00e3o do teor de quartzo nas esta\u00e7\u00f5es mais \n\n\n\n  Resumo \n\nIII \n \n\nprotegidas. Tamb\u00e9m a presen\u00e7a de pirita e siderita poderia explicar os altos valores de \n\nmat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, ao proporcionar um poss\u00edvel ambiente redutor. \n\n Um grande conte\u00fado em carbonatos foi encontrado na esta\u00e7\u00e3o 4, podendo explicar-\n\nse devido \u00e0 poss\u00edvel presen\u00e7a de foramin\u00edferos. Em rela\u00e7\u00e3o ao sequestro dos carbonos, \u00e9 \n\ninfluenciado por praticamente todas as vari\u00e1veis estudadas, j\u00e1 que influenciam as \n\ncaracter\u00edsticas do solo, favorecendo ou desfavorecendo a acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono. Como \n\npor exemplo a presen\u00e7a de determinados compostos minerais ou subst\u00e2ncias que foram \n\ndeterminadas na an\u00e1lise da composi\u00e7\u00e3o mineral e cor, que favorecem a agrega\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\nmat\u00e9ria org\u00e2nica, ou outras resultando em condi\u00e7\u00f5es reduzidas permitindo que ocorra uma \n\nmaior acumula\u00e7\u00e3o no sedimento. Nem todas as vari\u00e1veis mostram o mesmo padr\u00e3o ou \n\ntend\u00eancia relativamente \u00e0s esta\u00e7\u00f5es ou ao tipo de comunidade biol\u00f3gica. Para todas as \n\nvari\u00e1veis estudadas neste trabalho, apenas algumas delas n\u00e3o apresentaram varia\u00e7\u00f5es em \n\nambos os fatores estudados. A melhoria destas representam diferen\u00e7as entre esta\u00e7\u00e3o e entre \n\nambientes e mais da metade respondem \u00e0 intera\u00e7\u00e3o deles. Atendendo ao objetivo principal \n\ndeste estudo, foram encontradas diferen\u00e7as significativas entre os dois ambientes, \n\nmostrando a S. maritima aproximadamente o dobro do conte\u00fado de carbono do que a Z. \n\nnoltii. Esta variabilidade foi relacionada com o tamanho do gr\u00e3o, observando-se uma \n\nrela\u00e7\u00e3o positiva entre a concentra\u00e7\u00e3o de carbono org\u00e2nico e a presen\u00e7a de sedimentos mais \n\nfinos. Todos os fatores encontram-se influenciados pela composi\u00e7\u00e3o do solo e \n\nhidrodin\u00e2mica. Finalmente, quando foi calculada a taxa da acumula\u00e7\u00e3o do carbono, S. \n\nmaritima acumula dobro do que a Z. noltii, com resultais de valores de 131.8 g OC.m\n-\n\n2\n.year\n\n-1\n, 83.9 g OC.m\n\n-2\n.year\n\n-1, \nrespectivamente. Estas diferen\u00e7as foram relatadas pela \n\ninflu\u00eancia de todas os par\u00e2metros analisados em este estudo.   \n\nChaves palavras: Zostera noltii, Spartina maritima, Ria Formosa, sumideiro de \n\ncarbono, carbono org\u00e2nico, taxa da acumula\u00e7\u00e3o do carbono. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Abstract \n\nIV \n \n\nABSTRACT \n\nCarbon sinks are natural or artificial reservoirs in which carbon can be accumulated \n\nfor a certain length of time. Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses beds are habitats that \n\nhave an important role on the carbon budget of the oceans and thus influence the oceanic \n\ncycle. In this study we aimed is to evaluate C storage capacity of two different intertidal \n\nenvironments, Zostera noltii vs Spartina maritima from Ria Formosa, as well as to \n\nevaluate the influence of hydrodynamics and sediment grain size in the C storage. This \n\nmultidisciplinary and integrated approach includes biological, geological and chemical \n\nanalyses in order to better understand the processes leading to Carbon accumulation in \n\nsediments. For such a purpose, we analyzed and measured the granulometry, color and \n\nmineral composition of the sediment, as well as the organic matter, calcium carbonate \n\ncontents and the elemental composition. The results obtained reflect that the carbon \n\nsequestration (organic carbon content), is related to practically all the studied variables, \n\nFurthermore, there are significant differences between both biological communities. S. \n\nmaritima shows nearly twice the organic carbon content than Z. noltii. On the other hand, \n\nthe distance to the main navigation channel, a proxy to hydrodynamics, affected all \n\nparameters, strongly affected C accumulation, with higher variability in Z. noltii than S. \n\nmariima. C accumulation and sediment grain size were related to this gradient, as \n\nexpected, where both parameters increased from the first station, close to the main channel, \n\nto last station the most remote. The carbon accumulation rate for S. maritima environment \n\nwas twice as high as those for Z. noltii environment, 131.8 g OC.m\n-2\n\n.year\n-1\n\n, 83.9 g OC.m\n-\n\n2\n.year\n\n-1, \nrespectively, these differences were related to the influence to all the parameters \n\nanalyzed in this study.   \n\nKeys words: Zostera noltii, Spartina maritima, Ria Formosa, carbon sink, organic \n\ncarbon, carbon accumulation rate. \n\n\n\n   \n\n \n \n\n \n\nINDEX \n\n1.

Introduction \n\n1.1. Carbon cycle in marine systems. \n\nThe carbon cycle has two important parts. One part is the biological pump, i.e. \n\nredistribution of biologically active elements such as carbon, nitrogen and silica in the \n\nocean waters and the second part is the removal of these by deposition and burial in \n\nsediments. The formation of organic matter (OM) and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) allows \n\npart of the carbon that is fixed by plankton to sink toward the deep ocean and is stored and \n\nburied for long periods of time before returning to the atmosphere (Sanchez et al., 2013). \n\nThis accumulation and sequestration of carbon is known as biological carbon sink, \n\nwhenever CO2 emission is lower than its inputs (Diaz., 2014). The ocean is considered an \n\nimportant carbon sink, which is referred commonly as Blue carbon (Nellemann et al., \n\n2009). The publication of the Blue carbon report by Nellemann and co-authors (2009) \n\nshowed the importance of the marine ecosystems in carbon sequestration. Coastal Marine \n\necosystems such as Mangroves, saltmarshes and seagrass beds particularly show an \n\nelevated carbon sequestration with relation to their global area (Laffley and Grimsditch, \n\n2009). Recent data estimates that these ecosystems are responsible for capturing up to 70% \n\nof the organic carbon from the marine environment (Nellemann et al., 2009). These \n\necosystems have a great capacity to sequester and store important amounts of carbon in \n\ntheir sediments. About 20% of the global carbon sequestration is retained by these \n\necosystems despite occupying only 0.1% of the ocean surface (Duarte et al., 2013). \n\nSeagrass meadows bury carbon at a rate 35 times greater than the terrestrial \n\necosystems e.g. the tropical forests (McLeod et al., 2011).  Furthermore, there is a \n\ndifference between the accumulation time of carbon in the terrestrial forests when \n\ncompared to seagrass meadows, ranging from decades to thousands of years respectively \n\n(Macreadie et al., 2014). These ecosystems are adapted to marine life and can be found \n\nboth permanently or temporarily submerged (Duarte et al., 2013). They provide many \n\necosystem services. For example, tidal salt marshes protect coastal fisheries of physical \n\nenergy of the sea and provide shelter for juvenile fish. They provide valuable habitat for a \n\nlot of plants, birds and others animals, whose can serve as food resources. They also \n\n\n\n  Introduction \n\n2 \n \n\nprovide services and supplies to recreational hunters and fisher, many of which can give \n\nindirect economic benefits. They also offer protection from storm surges (Chmura., 2013). \n\nWith respect to the accumulation of carbon in seagrass meadows, it is due to \n\nbreaches, stems and leaves (above-ground biomass), roots (below-ground biomass), and \n\nlitter and dead wood (non-living biomass) (Grimsdith et al., 2013), as well as to \n\nsedimentary organic and inorganic constituents such as bacteria, microalgae, macro algae, \n\ndetritus and carbonates respectively (Macreadie et al., 2014). This carbon is stored over \n\nmillennia in the sediments.  In addition, like the sea level rise, their sediments continue to \n\naccrete vertically, and hence do not become saturated with organic carbon; unlike \n\nterrestrial ecosystems that reach soil carbon equilibrium with time (centuries or millions of \n\nyears) (Grimsdith et al., 2013).  \n\nAnother explanation of the high carbon storage capacity of these environments is \n\ntheir capacity of acting as particulate traps. They develop large canopies that affect the \n\nflow of water existing above them, which in turn can modify their environmental abiotic \n\nconditions. One consequence of this develop of canopies is the accumulation of sediment \n\nand decreasing the resuspension of particles in the background. The formation of these \n\ncanopies favors effectiveness of benthic subtracts, increasing the deposition surface of the \n\nsediment and probability of contact. Another characteristic that increases carbon \n\naccumulation is the presence of epiphytes on the leaves, because they increase the \n\nroughness of the leaves (Duarte et al., 2013). Thus, the coastal marine sediments are \n\nextremely rich and contain the majority of blue carbon (Grimsdith et al., 2013). \n\nTo understand this capacity to sequester and store of carbon in the sediment of \n\ntheses ecosystems, it is important to define carbon stock  in an ecosystem,  as the amount \n\nof carbon stored, which is altered by having accumulation or release carbon in that \n\necosystem (Macreadie et al., 2014).  For example, the accumulation of carbon as \n\ncarbohydrates in the rhizomes can be used by the plant for respiration, or released in the \n\nsediments, where the secondary microbial production is supported. The carbon structure of \n\nthe leaves is decomposed by bacteria and recycled by seawater. These two forms of carbon \n\naccumulation have a short residence time and thus cannot be considered part of the carbon \n\nstock. However, as the roots and rhizomes carry out their growth in the sediments under \n\n\n\n  Introduction \n\n3 \n \n\nanoxic conditions, they have a low nutritional value for the bacteria (Macreadie et al., \n\n2014). This low interest is due to the low concentration of nutrients (nitrogen and \n\nphosphorus) in their tissues (Duarte et al., 2013), so their decomposition is very slow and \n\nthus they accumulate in the sediments along large periods of time and can hence be \n\nconsidered as part of the carbon stock (Macreadie et al., 2014). Some authors have defined \n\nthat 80% of the production of seagrass is not consumed by herbivorous and the rate of \n\ndecomposition of this detritus is very low (Duarte et al., 2013). In terms of environmental \n\nfactors affecting C capture and storage by seagrass,  Macreadie and co-authors (2012) \n\nproposed some effects such as that of altered physical-chemical states on remineralization \n\nrates and the role of bioturbation fauna in facilitating mechanical flux of buried C out of \n\nsediment (role of microbial communities, also known as early diagenesis). \n\nIn summary, the high carbon storage capacity of seagrass has been explained \n\nbecause of its high primary production, its high capacity to filter out particles from water \n\ncolumn and its high sediment retention capability. All this combines with a slow rate of \n\ndecomposition in a seagrass environment low oxygen sediment and the lack of fires \n\nunderwater (Fourqurean et al., 2012).  \n\nOn the other hand, there is also an important variation in the carbon capture and \n\nstorage between species. Carbon sequestration will vary according to their different rates \n\nof primary production, their ability to trap allochthones carbon through their canopies, the \n\nrecalcitrance of the OC in their organs and in accordance with the characteristics of its \n\npreservation in sediments. In addition, the sp-habitat interactions influence carbon \n\nsequestration such as latitudinal, habitat ranges of temperature variations, sediment type, \n\nrespiration in the sediment and remineralization (Labery et al., 2013). For example, the \n\nbiochemical composition of the cell wall and other exterior cellular components among the \n\nseagrass meadows are probably different when looking at a high detailed level. These \n\ndifferences may require changes in microbial enzymatic processes of different \n\ndissimilative bacteria or fungi (Zak et al., 2006). In fact, one sediment profile can result \n\nfrom both aerobic and anaerobic processes. Different suites of microbes and microbial \n\ndigestive systems may occur depending on the ecology of habitats, with differences \n\nbetween tropical and temperate habitats (Hoppe et al., 2002).  Therefore, the integration of \n\n\n\n  Introduction \n\n4 \n \n\ndifferent environmental, chemical and biological factors is of fundamental importance in \n\norder to decipher their influence on the carbon storage capacity of seagrass. Understanding \n\nthe causes for the high capacity of seagrass to capture and store carbon is fundamental to \n\nmanage these ecosystems. Therefore, the seagrass may be even more important to the \n\noceanic C cycle than previously considered (Fourqurean et al., 2012). \n\nDuring recent times, close to 30% of seagrass area worldwide has been destroyed \n\n(Waycott et al., 2009), which is a major loss of C sink. Increasing the concern of large C \n\nleaks to the atmosphere, and thus accelerating climate warming. Current global rates of \n\nglobal loss of these ecosystems are calculated to be 0.7\u20132% per year (Grimsdith et al., \n\n2013), among the  highest rates of any ecosystem on the planet. This loss of seagrass C \n\nstocks, like terrestrial environments, is also due to anthropogenic disturbances either \n\ndirectly or indirectly. Indeed, sediments can be dredged, but the most common cause of \n\nseagrass disappearance is the degradation of water quality (Fourqurean et al., 2012). Thus, \n\nwhen these ecosystems are degraded or destroyed, large emissions of carbon dioxide are \n\nproduced. This source of carbon dioxide is caused by the oxidation of carbon in biomass \n\nand organic content of sediment. This process occurs in the decade after the disturbance, \n\nbut continues with the continuous oxidation of carbon that has been accumulated in the \n\nsediments for millennia (Grimsdith et al., 2013). Such a loss also means a decrease in its \n\nservices to the ecosystem, such as symbiotic habitat and nutritional base for fish, shellfish \n\nand others animals. Another important function being lost with the loss of these \n\necosystems is the stabilization of bottom sediments, cleaning of the water to the sediments \n\nand nutrients suspended in water (Touchette and Burkholder, 2000).  \n\nIn addition, the most pervasive threat to the remaining area of salt marsh is \n\nprobably accelerated sea level rise. Implications of this threat are increasing duration of \n\ntidal flooding, limiting vegetation production at the lower elevations along the seaward \n\nedge of the marsh and the possible disappearance of these marshes due to landward lateral \n\naccretion (Chmura., 2013). \n\nAccording to previous studies the vast majority of database on organic carbon (OC) \n\nin seagrass are referred to North America, Western Europe and Australia. In South \n\nAmerica and Africa there is remarkably fewer data, as well as in the tropical Indo-Pacific \n\n\n\n  Introduction \n\n5 \n \n\nor southern Europe and thus, given the large spatial extent of seagrass, few data is \n\neffectively known (Fourqurean et al., 2012). \n\nBecause the collected data attributed to the capture of OC in seagrass is very \n\nlimited, it tends to base almost all the estimates in OC content of oceanic sediments from \n\nthe Mediterranean Posidonea oceanica meadows. The P. oceanica however is unusual in \n\nits ability to capture C because it can extend several meters below the sediment and persist \n\nfor thousands of years, which is a massive storage of C. From what it is known so far, there \n\nis no other marine grass that has these characteristics. Nellemann and co-authors (2009) \n\nrecognized that an upper estimate of Blue Carbon sink might exist, which could be due to \n\nuncertainties in accumulation rates of different seagrass ecosystems (Lavery et al., 2013). \n\n \n\n1.2. Characterization of the Ria Formosa. \n\nThe studied zone is located in a shallow mesotidal lagoon system with a surface \n\narea of close 84 km\n2 \n\non the south coast of Portugal (Guimar\u00e3es et al., 2012). It has \n\nimportant natural biogeochemical cycles regulated by tidal exchanges at the seawater \n\nboundaries and at the sediment interface (Newton et al., 2003) and producing highly \n\nproductive tidal environment (Friend et al., 2003). This area can be thus classified as rich \n\necosystem thanks to its lagoon system and barrier islands and its physic-chemical, \n\nbiological and geological characteristics. \n\nThis lagoon system named Ria Formosa is separated from the sea by a 55 km long \n\nbarrier islands chain which is characterized by the presence of coastal landscapes such as \n\nbeaches, coastlines of sand barriers, marshes and dunes. Furthermore, Ria Formosa \n\nhabitats have a varying stability from cohesive to non-cohesive sediments (Friend et al., \n\n2003), as it is composed of sand, mud and muddy sands. \n\nThe main habitat of Ria Formosa consists of an intertidal zone of about 30 km long \n\nand an elevation of 0.4-0.5m above the mean sea level. Andrade (1990) distinguishes three \n\ntypes of intertidal flat, according to distinctive characteristics, such as elevation, sediment \n\ntype and position within the lagoon system: \n\n\n\n  Introduction \n\n6 \n \n\n- Back-barrier flats located behind the spits: Due to their weak hydrodynamic \n\nregime, they consist of fine sediment, and are located at a higher elevation than the other \n\ntypes; \n\n- Flood-delta flats corresponding to the innermost part of tidal inlets: They are \n\nessentially sand deposits, often covered by bed forms generated during the flood tide;  \n\n- Creek-edge flats as the most common type across the lagoon:  They are located \n\nalong main channels and secondary creeks furthest away from the inlets. \n\nIn the lagoon, a distinctive sediment zonation is found moving across the profile \n\nfrom the lower to the upper intertidal environment, with a fining upward trend of the \n\nsediments (Friend et al., 2003). Saltmarshes are found at ever increasing density as one \n\nmoves away from the inlets. \n\nThe dynamics of the lagoon is dominated by the exchange of water at six entry points \n\nlinking the lagoon to ocean and coastal ecosystems. \n\nFrom a more general point of view, Ria Formosa has an average depth of 2 m and a \n\ntidal range that varies from a maximum of 3.7 m in spring to a minimum of 0.4 m. The \n\nsalinity values are in a range between 35.5 and 36.9 throughout the year, except during \n\nperiods of intense rain and thus salinity may be less than 15. The water temperature varies \n\nfrom 12 \u00b0 C to 27 \u00b0 C (winter to summer, respectively) (Friend et al., 2003). \n\nThe aquatic vegetation of the Ria Formosa is distributed spatially in relation to the \n\nelevation of the tide. Saltmarsh species such as Spartina mar\u00edtima and Sarcocornia \n\npernneisse are found in the upper intertidal area that is only flooded during high tides. \n\nZostera noltii seagrass beds, green (Enteromorpha spp, Ulva spp) and brown (Fucus \n\nversiculosus) macroalgal mats are found in the lower intertidal flats (Friend et al., 2003). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Introduction \n\n7 \n \n\n1.3. Objective of the present study. \n\nSince until now, there have been no studies on carbon accumulation in this \n\nenvironments in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon system, Southern Portugal, the present \n\nstudy aims to fulfil this lack of information and thus to study the importance of the C \n\nstocks in two different environments. \n\nAccordingly, the main objective of the present study is to evaluate C and N storage \n\ncapacity of two different intertidal environments, Z. noltii vs S .maritima from Ria \n\nFormosa, as well as to evaluate the influence of environmental parameters such as the \n\nsediment grain size, which is a proxy of hydrodynamics. \n\nIn order to reach this main objective, the following questions will be assessed:  \n\n- Is there a difference in C sequestration between S. maritima and Z. noltii habitats? \n\n- What is the relation between OC content and the sediment granulometry? \n\n- What is the relation between OC content and the sediment color? \n\n- What is the relation between the ON and the OC? \n\n- Is there a relationship between the concentrations of pigments and C sink?  \n\nThis is thus a multidisciplinary and integrated approach that includes biological, \n\ngeological and chemical analyses in order to better understand the processes leading to \n\ncarbon accumulation, conservation or degradation. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n8 \n \n\n2. Materials and methods. \n\n2.1. Sampling sediment in the Ria Formosa \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.1: Sampling sediments in the Ria Formosa in a Z. noltii zone (left) and transportation between \n\nstations (right). \n\nThe sampling was carried out in the main channel and in a tributary channel of Ria \n\nFormosa Lagoon system (Fig. 2.1), in four different stations according to a transect along \n\nthe tributary channel. Stations coordinates are the following (Fig. 2.2): \n\n- Station 1 (36\u00ba58\u201956.65\u2019\u2019N ; 7\u00ba53\u201916.56\u2019\u2019W) \n\n- Station 2 (36\u00ba59\u201920.51\u2019\u2019N ; 7\u00ba52\u201933.08\u2019\u2019W)  \n\n- Station 3 (36\u00ba59\u201956.88\u2019\u2019N ; 7\u00ba52\u201945.08\u2019\u2019W)  \n\n- Station 4 (37\u00ba00\u201908.22\u2019\u2019N ; 7\u00ba52\u201953.72\u2019\u2019W)  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n9 \n \n\nFigure 2.2: Sample location of the Ria Formosa lagoon on the south coast of Portugal (upper image). The  \n\nStations were numbered Station 1 to Station 4. Image obtained from Google Earth (lower image). \n\n \n\nAt each station, two different environments, namely with Z. noltii or S. maritima, \n\nwere sampled in order to assess the variability in organic carbon (Corg) stock in the \n\nrespective sediments. Four replicates of each sample were collected using 2.5 cm diameter \n\nsyringes pushed 8 times into the top 5 cm of the sediment (Fig. 2.3). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n10 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.3: Photos of the sampling method with syringes showing one replicate sampling with several holes \n\nStation 4 was sampled before S. maritima sample from station 3 was collected due \n\nfast tidal inundation at station 4. \n\nA calibrated portable pH meter was used to measure in situ pH (NBS scale) at each \n\nsampling station. Temperature and salinity were also measured alongside with pH readings \n\n(Table 1 in the Annex 1). No measurements of Station 3 for S. maritima because the tide \n\nwas already high \n\nAround 25 ml of each sample replicate was sub-sampled onboard the boat into 50 \n\nml falcon previously prepared for liquid nitrogen freezing. These subsamples were then put \n\ninto the -80\u00baC freezer at University arrival. The other samples were maintained in the \n\nfridge at 6 \u00b0C. \n\n \n\n2.2. Laboratory work. \n\nThe laboratory analyses required for a basic assessment of C stocks consisted into \n\ntwo distinct analyses: \n\n- Sedimentological Analyses. \n\n- Geochemical Analyses. \n\nFigure 2.4 illustrates the processes carried out in the laboratory for each sample.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n11 \n \n\nFigure 2.4: Process scheme followed for each of the sample. The example is with Sp1a sample that is the \u201ca\u201d \n\nreplicate of the sample retrieved at station 1 from S. maritima environment. \n\n \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n12 \n \n\n2.2.1. Sediment Analysis. \n\nIn this analysis the granulometry, the color determination and the mineral \n\ncomposition of the sediment were measured, with the following procedures: \n\n2.2.1.a. Sediment granulometry by laser counting and sieving. \n\nFine particle grain size analysis was performed using a diffraction laser particle- \n\nsize analyzer, namely through a Mastersize 2000 model APA of 2000 of \u00a9Malvern \n\nInstruments Ltd., showed in the figure 2.5.   \n\n \nFigure 2.5: Picture showing the Mastersize 2000 model APA of 2000 of \u00a9Malvern Instruments Ltd. \n\nThis technique is based on the assumption that a particle diameter is equivalent to a \n\nsphere that gives the same diffraction as the particle does. This method sees the particle as \n\na two-dimensional object and gives its grain size as a function of the cross-sectional area of \n\nthat particle (Konert et al. 1997).  \n\n The Malvern equipment measures the angle variation intensity of light scattered as \n\na laser beam passes through the sample dispersed in water.  Hence large particles scatter \n\nlight at small angles relative to the laser beam and small particles scatter light at large \n\nangles. So to calculate the particles size, the angular scattering intensity data is analyzed. \n\nThe device has 52 detectors located at different positions. This set of detectors \n\ngenerates a distribution of light intensity. Each detector element emits a signal, which is \n\namplified and digitalized, to an electronic measuring system. This is transferred to a \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n13 \n \n\ncomputer that is appropriate to their analysis using the appropriate software (G\u00e1zquez., \n\n2011) in this case the Mastersizer Micro software. \n\nTo perform the granulometry we have to prepare 20 L of helix water with an \n\nadditional 20 g of Sodium Polyphosphate PRS (NaPO3) n to disperse the grains. The \n\nsolution was shacked for 15 min to allow dilution. \n\n A day before performing the granulometry, all samples were prepared in \n\nprecipitating glasses of 250 ml, by mixing a small amount of sample (a small spoon) with a \n\nthe solution described above. The roots and plant debris were removed with tweezers as far \n\nas possible, because in the Malvern method these elements can induce errors. \n\nTwo analyses were made, one in which the samples still contained their organic \n\nmatter content and the other after its removal using peroxide (H2O2). This last process is \n\nslow, needing several days for a complete oxidation of the organic matter. \n\nThis analysis allowed estimating the relative energy level present in the \n\nenvironment when the sediment was transported and deposited.  \n\nOn the other hand, fine to coarse grain ratio was done using a sieve sequence of 1 \n\nmm and 63 ?? mesh. This allowed assessing the proportion of sand present in each sample \n\n(Fig. 2.6). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.6:  Sediment granulometry by the sieving process for evaluating the coarse grain ratio. \n\n \n\n2.2.1.b. Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy for color determination. \n\nVisible light diffused reflectance spectra was determined with a spectrophotometer \n\nColortron\nTM\n\n. This spectrophotometer is a device that measures the color at the surface of \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n14 \n \n\nsolids and transfers it to the ColorshopTM program. This technique can use various color \n\nscales such as CIE Lab, CIE RGB, CIE XYZ, among other scales. \n\nIn this study of color we used the CIE L * a * b * system (Commission \n\nInternational de l'Eclairage) designed in 1976. Where: L* axis is the lightness, the \n\nminimum value being 0 (black) and maximum 100 (white); a* axis from red (positive \n\nvalues) to green (negative values) or zero (neutral); b * axis from yellow (positive values) \n\nto blue (negative values) or zero (neutral).  \n\nDiffuse reflectance spectrophotometry (DRS) is a rapid and nondestructive \n\ntechnique, which is based on the percent reflectance of a sample relative to white light (e.g. \n\nFont et al., 2013.) \n\nThe device is designed to scan the light reflected from the sample surface, using a \n\nwhite standard such as barium sulfate. With the characteristic spectral signature of some \n\nminerals of geological materials in this wavelength range may be qualified (Balsam and \n\nDeaton, 1991) and quantified (Balsan and Deaton, 1996) or even identified (Balsam et al., \n\n1998) namely for materials from the VIS spectrum (metal oxides, hydroxides and sulfides). \n\nTwo analysis were made, one in which the samples still contained organic matter \n\nand the other after removal of organic matter using H2O2.  Color fluctuates in function of \n\ngrain size, the sediment composition and humidity, hence three measurements were done \n\non each sample in order to account for the sample heterogeneity.  \n\n2.2.1.c.  Mineral identification. \n\nThe mineralogy of each sample was determined using a X- Ray Diffractometer \n\n\u201cX\u00b4pert\u201d (Fig. 2.7) as described in Pozo et al. (2010). This will allow determining the \n\norigin of the mineral fraction (detrital vs antigenic).  \n\n \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n15 \n \n\n  \n \n\nFigure 2.7: Full X- Ray Diffractometer \u201cX\u00b4pert\u201d (left) and its autosampler (right). \n\n \n\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) is the primary, non-destructive tool for identifying and \n\nquantifying the mineralogy of crystalline compounds. Every mineral or compound has a \n\ncharacteristic X-ray diffraction pattern whose 'fingerprint' can be matched against a \n\ndatabase.  The diffraction traces produced by individual constituents and highly complex \n\nmixtures can be interpreted by modern computer-controlled diffraction systems. \n\nMonochromatic X-rays are projected onto a crystalline material at a characteristic \n\nangle (?). Diffraction occurs when the distance traveled by the rays reflected from \n\nsuccessive planes differs by an integer (n) of wavelengths (?) (British geological Survey, \n\n2015). \n\nAround 2 g of sediment were placed in two containers grinding with 6 ml of \n\nalcohol. The mixture was ground for 10 min. Once ground, the content was poured into a \n\npetri plate. The petri allowed to dry the powder in an oven. Sample was then homogenized \n\nin an agate mortar and finally, in order to start the measurement, the sample was placed on \n\nown supports for analyzing RX. (Fig. 2.8) \n\nFigure 2.8: The figure shows the process carried out for each sample for mineralogical analysis as described \n\nin the text, namely: the grounding equipment, the two containers and resulting wet fine sediment, the drying \n\npetri dishes in the oven and the agate mortar. \n\n \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n16 \n \n\n 2.2.2. Geochemical analysis: \n\nAt first, each sample was weighed (P total) and its density (g ml\n-1\n\n) was calculated \n\nas the weight divided by the total sampled sediment volume.  \n\nSamples were weighted before (P1) and after lyophylization (P2), which was \n\nrealized using Savant lyophilizer Module. The process consisted in lyophilizing the \n\nsamples during 42 h to remove the water. The percentage of water was then calculated \n\nbased on the weight difference.  \n\nAfter the lyophilization, the samples were passed through a sieve of 1mm in order \n\nto assess the vegetables percentage (P3). Dried and sieved samples were then homogenized \n\nusing a ball mill (FRITSCH, planetary micro mil, pulverisette 7) (Fig. 2.9). Samples were \n\nsplit into two parts, or subsamples in order to analyze their Elemental composition, and to \n\ndeterminate their organic matter and carbonate contents \n\n \nFigure 2.9: Homogenization process using a ball mill (FRITSCH, planetary micro mil, pulverisette 7): Agate \n\ncontainers with balls (left), ball mill equipment (center), resulting powders (right). \n\n \n\n2.2.2.a.  Determination of Organic matter and carbonate contents by Loss of Ignition. \n\n   First, about 1.5g of dried and homogenized sample was weighted to know the \n\nexact weight (P4) before burning. Then samples were burnt to ash in a furnace at 450\n? \nC for \n\n2 hours, and the burnt samples were then weighted (P5) again to obtain the percentage of \n\norganic matter by differences of weights. In the next step, samples were burnt at 950\u00baC for \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n17 \n \n\n2 hours and then weighted (P6) again to obtain the percentage of carbonates by weight \n\ndifferences. \n\n \n\n2.2.2.b. Determination of Elemental composition: OC, IC, ON, IN and C/N. \n\n  The measurement of carbon and nitrogen contents in sediment was done following \n\nprocedures described by Campbell and co-authors (2014), using a Costech 410 Elemental \n\nAnalyzer (Fig. 2.10). \n\n \n\nFigure 2.10: The Costech 410 Elemental Analyzer. \n\nThe Elemental Combustion System is based on an automatic analytical unit whose \n\noperation, from sampling to signal detection, is microprocessor controlled. Helium carrier \n\ngas circulates within the analytical circuit which consists of a combustion reactor for \n\nCarbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen and Sulfur (CHNS) or a pyrolysis reactor for Oxygen. The \n\ncarrier gas brings the products of combustion or pyrolysis to a gas chromatographic \n\nseparation column and TCD detector for CHNS-O analysis (Costech, Analytical \n\nTecnologies. 2014). \n\nFor this analysis, the sample was weighted into a tin capsule and introduced into \n\noxygen-rich environment through an auto-sampler, and then the combustion process \n\noccurs. After the entire sample combustion, the gases (N2, CO2 and H2) are irreversibly \n\nadsorbed, and each component is determined in thermal conductivity detector. \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n18 \n \n\nThe reactions (Formula 2.1) involved in combustion process are based on the \n\nfollowing reaction: \n\nR-N + O2            N2 + NO x + O2 + CO + CO2 + CH4 + X- + SO x + H2O (Formula 2.1) \n\nAt the end of the analysis, results of the sample composition are given in CHN total \n\nproportion between 0.01% and 100% of dry weight. \n\nOnce the total CHN obtained, samples witch were burnt to ash in a furnace at 450\n? \n\nC, (samples without organic matter) had to be analyzed using the Costech 410 Elemental \n\nAnalyzer the samples in order to obtain the CHN inorganic content. Hence the organic \n\ncarbon (OC) was calculated (expressed in units of % dry weight) as: OC = TC \u2013 IC \n\n(Formula 2.2) \n\nAfter analyzing the elemental composition, to have an idea or first approximation \n\nof the source of the material composing the sediment was calculated C / N ratio. \n\n \n\n2.2.2.c. Determination of Pigment contents. \n\nDuring the sedimentary pigment analysis the sediment was been protected against \n\ndirect light and excessive warning to avoid the degradation of the pigments. Samples were \n\nfreeze dried at -80\u00baC. Three tests were done in order to know the sediment concentration \n\nthat would be necessary to have for significate pigment concentration. 150 mg, 0.5g, 1.5g, \n\n3g and 2g was analyzed. In the case of 3 g there was too much sediment, so the extraction \n\nwas impossible to do. Finally 150mg of sediment were used to do the analysis. The \n\nextraction was done and expressed as Sanger and Gorham (1972) modified as Lami and \n\nBuchaca (2002). \n\nF\n\nFigure 2.11: Pigment extraction process: samples protected against direct light (first image), acetone \n\naddiction (second), vortex (three) and sonication process (fourth).  \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n19 \n \n\nPigment extraction was been carried out from 150 mg of dry sediment sonicated \n\nwith 2 ml of 100% acetone for 40 seconds and  then the sample was centrifuged around 10 \n\nminutes at 3000rpm. Supernatant was taken, and the process was repeated the same form \n\none more time. Finally, the 4 ml was filtered with a filter of 0.22 \u00b5m pore diameter to \n\ndeterminate the chlorophyll derivatives (CD) and the total carotenoids (TC) (Fig. 2.11). \n\nThe filtered solution was measured immediately in a spectrophotometer UV / \n\nVisible, Beckman Coulter, Du\u00b4650 (Fig. 2.12).  \n\n \n\n \n\nFigure 2.12: Spectrophotometer UV / Visible, Beckman Coulter, Du\u00b4650. \n\nThe spectrophotometer uses the properties of light and its interaction with other \n\nsubstances, to determine the nature of the same. In general, light from special lamp \n\ncharacteristics is guided through a device that selects and separates light of a particular \n\nwavelength and passes through a sample. The intensity of light leaving the sample is \n\ncaptured and compared to the intensity of light that penetrated the sample and from this the \n\ntransmittance of the sample is calculated. It allows to determine the concentration of a \n\nsubstance (in this case the determinate the chlorophyll derivatives (CD) and the total \n\ncarotenoids (TC)) in a solution, allowing the realization of quantitative analysis. \n\nOn the other hand specific pigments were determined by ion pairing, reverse-phase \n\nHPLC in Centre of Marine Science (CCMAR) by the Marine Plant Ecology group, \n\nUniversity of Gambelas, Faro. \n\n \n\n\n\n  Materials and methods \n\n20 \n \n\n2.3. Statistic Analysis. \n\nData processing was focused on characterizing and understanding the C \n\nconcentration present in the surface sediment, with respect to the geochemical and \n\nsedimentological differences and physical properties of the four studied stations in both \n\nenvironments (Z. noltii and S. maritima). The data processing was performed through the \n\nstatistical software R. This software is an open source language and programming. It seeks \n\nto explain correlations and dependencies of a physical or natural phenomenon occurring \n\nrandomly or conditionally, i.e., it is a language and environment for statistical and \n\ngraphical analysis. \n\n An exploratory data analysis was performed from graphical representation of \n\nboxplot, biplot and correlations of variables to better understand the trend of the data. Two \n\nway ANOVAs with station and type of environment as factors were also performed for \n\neach variable to see whether or not there are significant effects of each independent factor \n\nand of their interaction. In the case of significant difference, a post hoc analysis was \n\napplied to determine where the difference was localize, in this case we used Tukey test. \n\nIn addition, it is important to note that  Gradistat program (Blot and Pye., 2001) \n\nwas also used to do the calculation of grain size statistics based on Folk and Ward (1957) \n\nincluding: mean, mode(s), sorting (standard deviation), skewness, kurtosis, and a range of \n\ncumulative percentile values (the grain size at which a specified percentage of the grains \n\nare coarser) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n21 \n \n\n3. Results \n\n3.1. Sediment Analysis: \n\n3.1.3. Sediment granulometry by laser counting and sieving. \n\n  The grain size results are presented in Table 2.I in Annex 2. The textural \n\ncomposition of the samples varies between 5 and 25 % wv of clay (Fig. 3.1), 1 and 16 % \n\nwv of silt and 7 and 88 % wv of sand. The grain size of samples after removing the organic \n\nmatter range 17.80 \u2013 126.70 \u00b5m, with an average of 56 \u00b5m whereas the grain size of \n\nsamples with organic matter range 21.34 \u2013 1007.30 \u00b5m, with an average of 69.47 \u00b5m.  The \n\ncoarser sediment is found in station 1 for Z. noltii environment, whereas the finest \n\nsediment is from station 4 also in Z. noltii environment. Thus a progressive grain size \n\ndiminution from station 1 to station 4 was observed, as well as a higher variability in Z. \n\nnoltii than S. maritima. It is important to note that this gradient is mainly observed in the \n\ngranulometry made on samples after removing the organic matter. \n\nFigure 3.1:  Percentage of clay size particles with no organic matter (% dw, Clay Mineral) in function of \n\nsampling station for each species. \n\n \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n22 \n \n\nIn a similar manner as seen for the Clay content from the sediment without organic \n\nmatter (\u201cMineral Clay\u201d), the fine/coarse ratio (Fig. 3.2) shows the same observed trend \n\nfrom station 1 to 4 with ratios varying from 1 to 6, but this time in both environments. \n\nFigure 3.2: Percentage Fine/Coarse in function of sampling station for each species. \n\nThis similarity in trends can be verified in the high correlations observed between \n\nthe two variables, being higher for Z .noltii than S. maritima with a value of 88% of \n\ncorrelation (Fig. 3.3), compared with a value of 44 % for S. maritima (Fig. 3.4). \n\n \n\nFigure 3.3: Rplot correlations between the clay content from the sediment without organic matter (\u201cMineral \n\nClay\u201d) and fine/coarse ratio in Z. noltii. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n23 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.4:  Rplot correlations between the Clay content from the sediment without organic matter (\u201cMineral \n\nClay\u201d) and fine/coarse ratio in S. maritima. \n\nWhen observing the `particle size distribution classification\u2019 (PSDC) of sediment \n\ntype based on the proportions of sand, silt and clay, which are plotted as a ternary diagram \n\nin Fig. 3.5, the classification correspond with the progressive grainsize diminution in Z. \n\nnoltii, environment from station 1, with a high percentage of sand, to station 4, with a \n\nhigher percentage of silt Fig. 3.5 (A), whereas S. maritima environment shows a smaller \n\ngradient, being able to group the stations 1 and 2 on one hand and 3 and 4 on the other \n\n(Fig. 3.5 (B). \n\nNevertheless, both environments are characterized by silty sand in station 1 and silt \n\nin station 4, even though S. maritima environments show slightly coarser sediment due to a \n\nhigher content of silt in relation to the clay content. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n24 \n \n\nFigure 3.5: Grain size ternary diagram for sediment classification (Folk 1954) showing the classification \n\nschemes for Z. noltii (A) and S. maritima (B) based on the relative percentages of sand, silt and clay.

L* measured in the samples with organic matter (L*) has a range of variation \n\nbetween 47.08 and 66.40, whereas L* measured in samples after removing the organic \n\nmatter (L*.no.OM) varies between 0 and 20.50.

The highest values are found in Z. noltii environment and \n\nthe smallest values in S. maritima (Fig.3.6). In the case of S. maritima environments values \n\nare below 0, thus colors with a green component, whereas for Z. noltii environments values \n\nare above 0, corresponding to a red component. \n\nFigure 3.6: a* color for samples with organic matter in function of sampling station for each species. \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n26 \n \n\nIn the other hand b *(ANOVA, p >0.05) and L* (ANOVA, p>0.05) colors do not \n\nprovide information for samples with organic matter (not shown here), nor does L* in \n\nsamples after organic matter removal, showing no significant differences (ANOVA, p \n\n>0.05) by environments, i.e. there are no significant changes in these color components. \n\nWhen observing the results of the analyzed samples after removal of the organic \n\nmatter, both a*no.OM (ANOVA, p<0.001) (Fig.3.7) and b*no.OM (ANOVA, p<0.001) \n\n(Fig.3.8) colors show differences in function of the sampling station for each specie and \n\nbetween species.

All the samples had a similar mineral composition (Table 3.1). However, some \n\nsamples have small amounts (&lt;5%) of plagioclase, feldspars or siderite. Furthermore, it is \n\nimportant to note that the biggest difference in the mineral composition is in the \n\npercentages between quartz and clay minerals. The quartz percentage is higher in the \n\nstation nearer to the main channel than the more remote station, the opposite occurs for \n\nclay minerals, their percentage increased from station 1 to station 4. With respect to the \n\ndifference between biological communities, generally the mineralogical composition for Z. \n\nnoltii is more variable and complex than for S. maritima. \n\nTable 3.1:  Mineral composition (%) for each station in function of sampling station for each species. \n\n \n\nSp1 Sp2 Sp3 Sp4 Zn1 Zn2 Zn3 Zn4\n\nMineral % % % % % % % %\n\nPyrite 2.4\n\nGoetite\n\nHematite\n\nMagnesite\n\nSiderite 4.2 4.2 3.2 3.4 7.3 8.4\n\nDolomite\n\nAnkerite\n\nCalcite 1.4 2.6 2.1\n\nPlagioclase 3.7 2.4 5 3.3 3.5 3.7\n\nFeldspar K 3.4 2.8 3.8 3.5 3 2.2\n\nQuartz 80 82 59 62 95 85 69 48\n\nAragonite\n\nAnhydrite 1.6\n\nCristobalite\n\nPhylosilicates 15 10 33 32 19 14 37\n\nGypsum 2.8 2.8\n\n\n\n  Results \n\n29 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 3.9:  Pattern of X-ray diffractometer for all the samples. \n\n \n\n3.2.

In both environments, there are differences \n\nbetween stations (ANOVA, p<0.001), there is an increase in water content throughout \n\nstations. Furthermore, it is possible to note also stabilization in the stations more distant \n\nfrom the main channel. For each environment, the smallest percentage of water content is \n\nfound in station 1, whereas the highest percentage is from station 4 in Z. noltii \n\nenvironment, showing thus a progressive increase from station 1 to station 4 (Fig.3.10). \n\nFigure 3.10:  Water content (% ww) in function of sampling station for each species. \n\nRegarding organic matter content, data show an average of 7.9 % dw, with a \n\nminimum and a maximum of 1.85 % dw and 11.92 % dw for stations 1 from Z. noltii \n\n(Zn1c) and 2 from S. maritima (Sp2a) respectively. \n\nWhen observing Figure 3.11, it is possible to observe differences (ANOVA, \n\np<0.001) in the content of organic matter between both environments. Hence, S. maritima \n\nenvironments present higher average of 9.87 % dw than for Z.noltii with an average of 5.93 \n\n% dw of organic matter. In S. maritima, the percentage of organic matter does not have \n\nsignificant variations between stations, but it is important to note the existence of \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n31 \n \n\ndifferences between station 1 and the other ones. In Z. noltii environments, a progressive \n\ngradient is observed again with the percentage of organic matter increasing from station 1 \n\nto station 4. \n\nFigure 3.11: Organic matter content (% dw) in function of sampling station for each species. \n\nIn relation to carbonate content, its average value is 2.54 % dw, with a minimum of \n\n0.62 % dw for station 3 in S. maritima (Sp3c) and, a maximum of 4.08 % dw for station 4 \n\nin Z. noltii (Zn4d). \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n32 \n \n\nFigure 3.12: Carbonate content (% dw) in function of sampling station for each species. \n\nAs it can be observed in Figure 3.12, carbonates contents show significant \n\ndifferences (ANOVA, p<0.01) in Station 4 of Z. noltii environment with respect to other \n\nstations, whereas there is no significant difference (ANOVA, p>0.05) between the \n\nenvironments. \n\n \n\n3.2.2. Determination of Elemental composition: OC, IC, ON, IN and C/N. \n\nThe Elemental composition results are presented in Table 3.II in Annex 3. This \n\ncomposition varies between 0.29 and 3.23 % dw, with an average value of 1.75 % dw of \n\nOC (organic carbon), 0.03 and 3.23 % dw, with an average value of 0.20 % dw of ON \n\n(organic nitrogen), 0.01 and 1.11 % dw with an average value of 0.53 % dw of IC \n\n(inorganic carbon) and -0 and 0.13 % dw, with an average value of 0.05 % dw of IN \n\n(inorganic nitrogen).  \n\n The highest organic carbon content  is found in station 4 for Z. noltii environment \n\n(Zn4b), whereas the smallest percentage is from station 1 also in Z. noltii environment \n\n(Zn1b), showing thus a progressive increase of the organic carbon content from station 1 to \n\nstation 4 as well as a higher variability in Z. noltii environments (Fig. 3.13). It is important \n\nto note that this same gradient is also observed in the result of the organic nitrogen content \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n33 \n \n\n(Fig. 3.15), where the maximum value is found in station 4 for S. maritima and the \n\nminimum value is found in station 1 for Z. noltii (Zn1b and Zn1c). It is possible to observe \n\ndifferences (ANOVA, p<0.001) for both, organic carbon and organic nitrogen contents \n\nwith respect to the different environments. The organic carbon content was almost double \n\nfor S. maritima than Z. noltii, 2.25% dw and 1.24% dw, respectively. In the other hand, the \n\norganic nitrogen content was also double for S. maritima than Z. noltii, 0.27 % dw and \n\n0.14 % dw.  \n\nFigure 3.13: Organic Carbon content (OC % dw) in function of sampling station for each species. \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n34 \n \n\nFigure 3. 14: organic nitrogen content (ON % dw) in function of sampling for each species. \n\nThis similarity in trends can be verified in the high correlations observed between \n\nthe two variables, with a value of 94 % in S. maritima (Fig. 3.15) and a value of 100 % for \n\nthe correlation in Z. noltii (Fig. 3.16). \n\nFigure 3.15: Rplot correlations between organic carbon (% dw OC) and organic nitrogen (% dw ON) to \n\nS.maritima environments. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n35 \n \n\nFigure 3.16: Rplot correlations between organic carbon (% dw OC) and organic nitrogen (% dw ON) to \n\nZ.noltii environments. \n\nIn the other hand, the inorganic nitrogen contents show significant differences \n\n(ANOVA, p<0.001) between both environments and smaller differences between stations \n\n(ANOVA, p<0.01).

However, it is important to note significant differences between stations \n\n(ANOVA, p<0.001); hence, it is possible to appreciate a progressive diminution from \n\nstation 1 to station 4 in both environments (Fig. 3.19). \n\n\n\n  Results \n\n37 \n \n\nFigure 3.19: C/N rate in function of sampling station for each species. \n\n \n\n3.2.3.

Sediment characterization  \n\n4.1.1. Sediment Analysis. \n\nOur results of sediment granulometry ranged between 3.3 \u2013 23.6 % wv (wet \n\nvolume) of clay in mineral samples (i.e. after organic matter removal), 1.6-15.8 % wv of \n\nsilt and 86.8 -7.3 % wv of sand varying slightly with respect data previously described by \n\nBrotas et al., 1990 with a range 0.2 \u2013 9.4 % of clay (? &lt;2 \u00b5m), 2.4 \u2013 76.6 % of silt (2 \u00b5m &lt;\n\n? &lt;60 \u00b5m) and 97.3 \u2013 14.0 % of sand (? > 60 \u00b5m) for samples of Ria Formosa. The \n\ndifference with the present study, namely coarser sediments in general, can be explained \n\nby the difference in the location of the sampling stations. In our study, stations have a \n\nprogression from the main channel, with high currents, continuing along a secondary \n\nchannel, with weaker currents, while in the other case the location of the sampling stations \n\nare randomly chosen. Values reported for other coastal systems with presence of both \n\necosystems (Mondego estuary, Portugal, Couto et al., 2013) are 50% of sand between 100 - \n\n50 microns (fine sand) in the case of S. maritima and 70% for Z. noltii. Silt and clay \n\ncontent values are only referred as being greater than 20%, in a similar manner as seen for \n\nour results where higher sand proportions were obtained in Z. noltii rather than in S. \n\nmaritima. \n\n  Granulometry results show a progressive diminution from station 1 to station 4 \n\n(Fig. 3.1) as well as a higher variability in Z. noltii environments in relation to S. maritima \n\nenvironments. This gradient can be explained by decreasing energy environment, i.e., as a \n\ndecreasing of current speed (Fig. 4.1), as you move away from the main channel into the \n\nsecondary channel, causing deposition of smaller particles (Zaimes and Emanuel, 1902). \n\nThe mode grain size from station 1 to station 4 was  0.126, 0.105., 0.062 and 0.016mm, \n\nrespectively, reflecting as the mean current velocity decreased from station 1 to station 4, \n\nin a range close of 10 cm. sec\n-1\n\n   to station 1 and 2, and around 1.0cm. sec\n-1\n\nto the station 3 \n\nand 4  (Fig. 4.1). Hence, the smaller particles correspond with smaller settling-deposition \n\nvelocity. Whit respect to the habitats, no differences in the mode grain size were found. \n\nThe average values were 0.07 to S. maritima and 0.08 to Z. noltii. \n\n\n\n  Discussion \n\n40 \n \n\n \n\nFigure 4.1: Hjulstr\u00f6m Diagram of transport and deposition for particles for different sizes, \n\nregarding the average current speed (cm/sec) (Friedman et al., 1992) Blue circle: Approximation of \n\ncurrent speed to stations 3 and 4; Green:  Approximation of current speed to stations 1and 2.      \n\n  The existence of different gradient with respect to the grain size between the two \n\nenvironments may be due to the different position with respect to the sea level of both \n\necosystems. Z. noltii environments have a greater exposure to marine hydrodynamics than \n\nS. maritima, which is higher in the intertidal and therefore shows a smaller gradient. It is \n\nimportant to note that this difference in gradient for both environments was observed in \n\nmost of the studied parameters studied (see for example Fig. 3.10, 3.11, 3.12). \n\nColor is one of the most useful parameter to characterize and distinguish the soil or \n\nsediment composition allowing to obtain much information about the materials that \n\ncompose it. (Dominguez et al., 2011). The results obtained in the color analysis of the \n\nsediment of our study area, show differences for a *color (a * color With organic matter) \n\nbetween both environments (Fig. 3.6), with values below zero for the S. maritima, turning \n\ngreen, with an average of  -1.072  and values above zero in the Z. noltii, with an average of \n\n1.36, being more reddish. This red coloration may be due to the presence of minerals that \n\nact as coloring agents, such as oxides and hydroxides of Fe and Al or minerals with Iron \n\n\n\n  Discussion \n\n41 \n \n\n(Dominguez et al., 2011). The possible presence of different forms of Fe either in crystals, \n\nsuch as, such as pyrite and siderite, or as free element can be the cause of this difference \n\nbetween the two environments and mostly associated with a reducing environment. Hence, \n\nZ. noltii could be more reductant environment than S. maritima. Furthermore differences \n\nwere also found regarding a * color without organic matter (a *no.OM colors ) and b * \n\ncolor without organic matter (b * no.OM ) in S. maritima environment where a gradient \n\nwas observed in both colors (Fig 3.7 and 3.8). Values decreased from station 1 to station 4, \n\nbecoming less reddish and yellow, which can be interpreted with the decrease of various \n\nforms of Fe (reddish) and hydrated goethite (yellow-brownish) (Dominguez et al., 2011). \n\nWith respect to the different habitat, both colors showed bigger values in Z. noltii than S. \n\nmaritima. Respect to L*color, with and without organic matter in samples, showing no \n\nsignificant differences between environments, so there are no significant changes in these \n\ncolor components. This means that the reflectance of the samples was similar for all of \n\nthem, probably reflecting the same origin of the organic matter and of the mineral particles \n\nin all the samples.   \n\nWith respect to mineral composition, no differences in sediments sample are found \n\nneither between types of environment or between stations. However, some samples had \n\nsmall amounts (&lt;5%) of plagioclase, feldspars or siderite. Furthermore, the main \n\ndifference in the mineral composition was found in the percentages of quartz and clay \n\nminerals (phyllosilicates) (Table 3.9). The clay mineral proportions for the most remote \n\nstation from the main channel were coincident with the grain size.  Hence, the major \n\naccumulation of organic matter in these stations could be explained based on the \n\nmorphologic and chemical characteristic of clay mineral. This could be due to the strongly \n\nabsorption of organic matter by clay minerals. This interaction between the clay and some \n\nkinds of compounds can create relatively stable aggregates, and consequently, the moisture \n\nand aeration properties of the sediment are influenced. In addition, for this interaction \n\nresult a protective effect of the organic compound from biological degradation. Due to this \n\neffect of protection for degradation, the organic matter of the sediments is normally \n\npositively correlated with the clay mineral content (Norman, 1964), with smaller grain \n\nsize, as well as, the effect of hydrodynamics Whereas the differences in the proportions of \n\nquartz between stations, could be explained with a relation with the granulometry.  Some \n\n\n\n  Discussion \n\n42 \n \n\nauthors reported that the quartz has a positive correlation with  the percentage of sand (AE \n\nde Limnolig\u00eda, 1984). The proportions of quartz could increase with the sand content due \n\nto the fact that sands are mostly composed by quartz, hence in the stations exposed to \n\nhigher energy, which are associated with the deposition of sand, (Macreadie et al., 2012). \n\nAt the same time the presence of pyrite and siderite, may be associated to the existence of \n\nreduction conditions (Lemos et al., 2007), which would allow for the permanence of the \n\norganic material for a longer period of time in the sediment. \n\n \n\n4.1.2. Geochemical Analysis. \n\nThe average values of the water content was 46.12 \u00b1 11.30 % ww (wet weight), \n\nwith S. maritima environment having close 11% more water than Z. noltii, with values of \n\n51.6 and 40.6 % ww, respectively ours values are quite similar to the analysis performed in \n\nthe Ria Formosa, Ramalhete, by Friend and co-authors (2003), where the values obtained \n\nwere approximately 30 \u00b1 16 % wv and 32 \u00b1 18 % wv for their two campaigns, \n\nrespectively. No significant differences in the water content, for either transects or habitats, \n\nwere detected between the two campaigns. Furthermore, for both campaigns the highest \n\nmean water contents occurred within S. maritima ecosystems, which a mean value of 48 % \n\nwv. The water content of the sediment is directly related to grain size and is a consequence \n\nof the density of the sediment (Fig. 2.I and Fig. 2.II in the Annex 2). According to \n\nHalmilton (1974) there are empirical relation between mean grain size and density and also \n\nbetween grain size and the porosity (Syvitski, 2007). An increase of the water content was \n\nobserved as the proportion of fine grain size decreases and the consequent decrease in \n\ndensity (Fig. 3.I in the Annex 3). This result shows in turn that the choice of the stations \n\nlocation was pertinent for increasing confinement and thus reducing hydrodynamics along \n\nthe stations profile. \n\nRegarding the organic matter content, values were between1.86 and \u201311.92% dw, \n\nwhich are in accordance with the study of Caba\u00e7o and co-authors (2010), where it showed \n\nvalues with an average of 2 % dw.  It is important to note that percentage of organic matter \n\nwas, approximately a 40%, higher in S. maritima than Z. noltii. This difference could be \n\ndue to the variation in the hydrodynamic levels to which the biology communities are \n\n\n\n  Discussion \n\n43 \n \n\nexposed. S. maritima environment is less influenced by the hydrodynamics, so it could be \n\npossible that more organic matter deposition occur than in Z. noltii environment. At the \n\nsame time, an increasing gradient was observed in the organic matter content from the first \n\nstations, close to the main channel, to last stations the most remote (Fig. 3.11), gradient \n\nthat is in agreement with the grainsize variation. According to other studies, (Fabiano y \n\nDanovaro, 1994) the accumulation of organic matter in small grain sizes is favored because \n\ndissolved oxygen penetration is smaller and there is thus no oxidation of the organic \n\nmatter.  Therefore in sandy sediments which have a larger grain size than the silt and clay, \n\npenetration of oxygen is facilitated, leading to higher rate of organic matter oxidation. In \n\naddition the sediments formed by silt or clay may favor the formation of hypoxic or anoxic \n\nbottom layers due to lack of dissolved oxygen. \n\nSeagrass and saltmarsh are biological communities that support a lot of calcified \n\norganisms due to the accumulation of particulate inorganic carbon by the presence of \n\nepiphytic and benthic invertebrates. Sedimentation and deposition of carbonates is \n\nassociated with particle sedimentation and photosynthetic capacity of these ecosystems, \n\nwhich provides an optimal pH environment for deposition (Mazarrasa et al., 2015). \n\nCarbonate content values in this study were in the range 3 - 14% dw (mean of 2.54 \u00b1 0.77), \n\nsimilar to values reported for Ria Formosa with contents &lt;5% (Andarde et al., 2004). The \n\ncarbonate content obtained in ours samples showed significant differences in Station 4 for \n\nZ. noltii with respect to other stations in both environments (Fig. 3.12). By linking the \n\ncarbonate content with the grain size, it is possible to observe that increased carbonate \n\ncontent is proportional to the finer sediment (Fig. 2.III in the Annex 2), which could be \n\nexplained by the possible presence of foraminifera. Several studies such as Mechler and \n\nGrady (1984) have reported fine sediment preference of certain foraminifera such as \n\nA.beccarii var. Sobrina and A. beccarii var.tepida. \n\nThe organic nitrogen content of the sediment of S. maritima and Z. noltii \n\ncommunities has an average value of 0.20 \u00b1 0.10% dw, being similar to the reported value \n\nby Peralta et al. ( 2000)  in the Ria Formosa,  of 0.16 \u00b1 0.01% dw in the central channel \n\nand 0.26 \u00b1 0.04% dw in high intertidal zone. This lower sediment nitrogen content could \n\nresult in a higher rhizome elongation, and consequent greater root development, with the \n\n\n\n  Discussion \n\n44 \n \n\nobjective to increase nutrient uptake from the sediment (Peralta et al., 2000). It is important \n\nto note that S. maritima environment contained approximately the double of organic \n\nnitrogen than Z. noltii. This can be due to greater degradation in the Z. noltii sediment or \n\nalso to greater removal caused by the greater hydrodynamics, at which it is exposed.  \n\nOn the other hand, organic carbon contents in our study were slightly lower, with \n\nvalues of 1.75 \u00b1 0.85 % dw compared. to  2.0 \u00b1 0.5% dw and 2.9 \u00b1 0.4%, dw in Peralta et \n\nal. (2000). Also our values of organic carbon were in the range of, or even similar, to \n\nvalues for  other coastal systems as the ones reported by Couto et al. ( 2013) with both \n\nenvironments such as Mondego estuary, Portugal, with 2.2 \u00b1 0.2 % dw. In our study, the \n\nfact that S. maritima environment contained approximately twice more organic carbon than \n\nZ. noltii, could be explained due to a higher carbon oxidation or degradation in sediments, \n\nas well as a greater remove or less deposition in Z. noltii environment due to higher local \n\nhydrodynamics (action of currents and sediment washing). \n\nIn addition, our data showed a progressive increase of organic content, carbon and \n\nnitrogen, from station 1 to station 4 as well as a higher variability in Z. noltii environments \n\n(Fig. 3.13). This gradient could be explained by the presence of an inverse relationship \n\nbetween the size of the sediment particles and organic matter content (Fig. 2.IV and Fig. \n\n2.V in the Annex 2). The deposition of OM (and all particles) increases with decreasing \n\nhydrodynamics. Then the OM may better stabilized in sediments because they get attached \n\nto the fine sediment fractions. Hence, the material with higher silt-clay fractions has higher \n\nconcentrations of organic compounds (Silva et al., 1998). Furthermore, according to \n\nDuinker, (1980), the silt-clay particles can better be covered with a layer of organic \n\nmaterial, because these tend to have negative charges associated with their structure. As \n\neventually this component of the sediment sink to the ocean floor, remove a significant \n\namount of organic material from seawater. This author also indicates that sands are always \n\ncomposed by quartz, which have no charge, hence not attracting organic matter and are \n\ntherefore associated with lower amounts of organic material. Moreover, environments \n\nassociated with the deposition of sand are higher energy environments, so the currents \n\nproduced mixed sand and carbon oxidation occur, resulting in lower amounts of this latter \n\ncomponent (Macreadie et al., 2012).  \n\n\n\n  Discussion \n\n45 \n \n\nIn relation to inorganic content, for inorganic carbon values no marked differences \n\nbetween environments or between stations, with the exception of station 4 in Z. noltii, \n\nwhich presents the lowest values (Fig. 3.18) and cannot be relate with the high values of \n\ncarbonates associate with the finest sediments explained above. Brambai and co- authors \n\n(1991) indicated that the presence of inorganic carbon also might be due to the presence of \n\ncalcite, in particular Mg-calcite, which would be of biogenic origin. With respect to \n\ninorganic nitrogen values were slightly higher in S. maritima environment than in Z. noltii \n\nenvironment (Fig. 3.17). This difference in the content of inorganic nitrogen may be due to \n\nincreased presence of bacteria in the sediment, responsible for the remineralization of \n\norganic nitrogen to form their inorganic form. \n\nIn the other hand, C/N  organic ratio results ranged from 7.8 to 10.3 with an average \n\nof 8.8 with no significant differences between biological communities with similar values \n\nas 8.58 to S. maritima and 8.99 to Z. noltii, whereas important differences were observed \n\nbetween stations. Indeed, there is a progressive diminution C/N from station 1 to station 4 \n\nin both environments (Fig. 3.19). This gradient could be due to differences in the \n\nhydrodynamics at each station or a progressive difference in the origin of the organic \n\nmatter. The trend observed could indicate that the sediments for the more exposed stations \n\nto hydrodynamics, could suffer greater degradation of nitrogen, hence, a greater C/N ratio \n\nwas observed. Conversely, the stations that are less exposed to hydrodynamics could suffer \n\nless nitrogen degradation and therefore would have less C/N ratio. Similar results with \n\nrespect to values reported for Peralta et al. (2009), in Ria Formosa, were 14.2 \u00b1 1.3 for the \n\nmain channel and 12.7 \u00b1 2.6 for a higher intertidal channel. Higher ratios of 6.63 would be \n\npossible to explain as the presence of variables amounts of organic nitrogen poorest into \n\nterrigenous or edaphic material. When the C/N ratio exceeds 10, it may be because there is \n\nan increase in mineralization, causing a decrease of organic nitrogen. This means that the N \n\ncomponent of OM during decomposition decreases much faster than the C component \n\n(Silva and Ort\u00edz., 2002) , thus the C:N tends to be lower in the sediment than in live plants. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Discussion \n\n46 \n \n\n4.2. Carbon sequestration rate \n\nThe carbon accumulation rate was calculated using unpublished data of \n\nsedimentary rates of 0.5 cm.year\n-1 \n\nfor S. maritima environment and 0.9 cm year\n-1\n\n for Z. \n\nnoltii (Veiga-Pires and Santos, personal communication).The carbon accumulation \n\nestimates for ours samples ranged from 37.30 to 182.0 g OC.m\n-2\n\n.year\n-1\n\n, with an average of \n\n120.0 \u00b1 37.30\n \ng OC.m\n\n-2\n.year\n\n-1\n. More specifically, the carbon accumulation rate for S. \n\nmaritima environment was twice as high as those for Z. noltii environment, with values of \n\n131.8 g OC.m\n-2\n\n.year\n-1\n\nand 83.9 g OC.m\n-2\n\n.year\n-1, \n\nrespectively. In addition, it is possible to \n\nappreciate a progressive increase from station 1 to station 4 in both environments as well \n\nas a higher variability in Z. noltii (Fig 4.2).   \n\nFigure 4.2: Carbon accumulation rate (g. m\n-2\n\n. year\n-1\n\n) in function of sampling station for each \n\nspecies.  \n\nThis difference could be due to the difference between the sediment rates for both \n\nenvironments, as well as the difference in sediment density, because the carbon \n\naccumulation rate is highly dependent of the sediment rate and organic volumetric content \n\n(Lavery et al., 2013).  \n\n\n\n  Discussion \n\n47 \n \n\nDue to the lack of published data regarding rates of carbon accumulation in the Ria \n\nFormosa, our results were compared to values described by Duarte et al. (2005), which it \n\nsearched the published literature for estimates of carbon burial in vegetated ecosystems  to \n\nobtain estimates of average carbon burial of these habitats. Ours values were in the range \n\nof, or even similar, to values of this publication, where the estimates of carbon \n\naccumulation rate were 139.0, 151.0 and 83.0 g C m\n?2\n\n yr\n?1\n\n to mangroves, salt marsh and \n\nseagrass, respectively. Hence, these results agreed with our data because the mangroves and \n\nsalt marsh were identified as important environment for carbon burial, with rates twice \n\nbigger than seagrass meadows.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n   \n\n  Conclusions \n\n48 \n \n\n5. Conclusions \n\nIn order to reach the main objective of this study, the questions raised in the \n\nbeginning were answered \n\n- Is there a difference in C sequestration between S. maritima and Z .noltii \n\nhabitats? \n\n Yes, significant differences were found between both ecosystems. S.maritima environment \n\nshowed nearly twice the organic carbon content than Z. noltii environments. Which is \n\nreflected in theirs accumulation rate the same form, because the salt marsh were identified \n\nas important environment for carbon burial, with rates twice bigger than seagrass meadows.  \n\n- What is the relation between OC content and the sediment granulometry? \n\nIt was observed an inverse relationship between the size of the sediment particles \n\nand organic carbon content. Hence, gramulometry results show a progressive grainsize \n\ndiminution from station 1 to station 4, so inversely a progressive increase of the organic \n\ncarbon content was observed along stations. \n\n- What is the relation between OC content and the sediment color? \n\nThe possible presence of different forms of Fe either in crystals, such as pyrite and \n\nsiderite, or as free element can be cause of the difference in the organic carbon contents \n\nbetween the two environments and mostly associated with a reducing environment. \n\nFurthermore, the reflectance of the samples was similar for all of them, probably reflecting \n\nthe same origin of the organic matter and of the mineral particles in all the samples. \n\n- What is the relation between the ON and the OC? \n\nIt was observed a bigger correlation between ON and OC, both organic contents \n\nshow the same performance. S. maritima environment showed approximately twice more \n\norganic carbon and nitrogen contents than Z. noltii. Also, our data showed a progressive \n\nincrease of organic content from station 1 to station 4 as well as a higher in Z. noltii \n\nenvironment. Which could be explained by the existence of an inverse association between \n\nthe size of the sediment particles and organic contents or by the differences in the level of \n\nenergy, which are exposed. \n\n\n\n   \n\n  Conclusions \n\n49 \n \n\n- Is there a relationship between the concentrations of pigments and C sink?  \n\nWith respect to the concentration of pigment, we fail to answer this question due to \n\nthe possible degradation of the pigments. This result were considered not representative \n\ntherefore not be taken into account in this work. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n  Reference \n\n50 \n \n\n6.
