Provided it is\nmade clear which are proved facts and which are conjectures, no\nharm can result. Conjectures are of great importance since they\nsuggest useful lines of research.\n?Alan Turing, Alan Turing: The Enigma\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nFirst of all, I want to register here my love for my family. Their kindness and\nlove, specially during my PhD, helped (a lot) to struggle through and live the\nadventure of a thesis. I know they fought as hard as me against all the mixed\nfeelings between my arrivals and departures during my nomad life.\n\nSecondly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to both my supervisors,\nAss. Prof. Pascal Dupont and Prof. Geraldo de Freitas Maciel. They encour-\naged me and my project since the begging until the very last moment, constantly\ninspiring me with self-trust and scienti?c valors.\n\nI am very grateful to all members of the jury, from both sides of the Atlantic\nOcean, Res.

Basically, the\nresearch is focused on events that are con?ned in channels formed due to the\ntopography. The rain, source of the liquid discharge, generates the runo? ?ow\nwhich is responsible for wetting the soil surface, promoting reduction of soil co-\nhesiveness and erosion of small particles such as clay and sand. From this point,\nthe sediment transport can increase as small water ?ows merge and form greater\nstreams. The scenario keeps its evolution until it reaches high concentration of\nparticles in the ?uid mixture.\n\nIn the ?rst part, to study the non-permanent feature of sediment transport, an\nopen-channel experiment was designed for simulating runo? ?ow over a mobile\nbed. A measurement system was designed and constructed to instantaneously\ninspect the solid discharge of particles and the ?ow friction at the bed. This\napparatus is further used to explore the in?uence of free-surface waves on the\nsediment transport. Hydraulic properties of ?ows are qualitatively and quantita-\ntively studied and data are used to correlate characteristics of ?ow and sediment\ntransport. A set of experimental runs is presented and explored. Analysis of\nresults shows that for ?xed ?ow conditions, waves induce an overall smaller quan-\ntity of transported sediment.\n\nIn a second part, the dynamics of high concentrated ?ows is addressed and\nthis thesis attempts to apply a ?rst-order roll-wave model for Herschel-Bulkley\nlaminar ?uid ?ow to a registered natural event. Results presented point out that\nroll waves could have occurred during this already published case-study event.\nSimulations could predict wave heights within 8% on uncertainty with respect\nto the mean amplitude of measured waves. Finally a new theoretical solution\nfor the velocity pro?le is proposed taking into account the porosity of the bed.\nResults are then compared with numerical simulation performed in FLUENT. A\nparametric analysis is employed and the case-study is once again evaluated.\n\nAs general conclusion, the non-permanent phenomena that can appear during\n\nthe evolution of a mud?ow event a?ect the overall dynamics of the coupled system\n\n(hydraulic-sediment transport) in comparison to the steady and uniform case.\n\nVerifying that such phenomena could appear should indeed be an important part\n\nin hydraulic engineering projects, especially when dealing with lives, which is the\n\ncase of mud?ows.\n\nxix\n\n\n\n\n\nResumo\n\nEscoamentos n\u00e3o-permanentes de superf\u00edcie livre : uma\n\ncontribui\u00e7\u00e3o para o estudo do transporte n\u00e3o estacion\u00e1rio\n\nde sedimentos em escoamentos superficiais e para\n\ninstabilidades em corridas de lamas\n\nDentro da tem\u00e1tica de riscos naturais, mais precisamente no contexto das corri-\ndas de lama, esta tese surge da necessidade que existe na literatura em melhor\nse conhecer as caracter\u00edsticas temporais destes eventos. A chuva, fonte da vaz\u00e3o\nliquida, conduz aos escoamentos super?ciais, respons\u00e1veis pela redu\u00e7\u00e3o da co-\nes\u00e3o do material sedimentar do solo (areia e argila) e seu consequente transporte.\nEm locais de topogra?a \u00edngreme, de montante a jusante, a vaz\u00e3o s\u00f3lida do es-\ncoamento principal pode, eventualmente, evoluir devido \u00e0s contribui\u00e7\u00f5es laterais\nde pequenos escoamentos, alterando n\u00e3o s\u00f3 as propriedades reol\u00f3gicas do ?uido\ne din\u00e2micas do escoamento, como se manter at\u00e9 que o transporte s\u00f3lido atinja\nelevada concentra\u00e7\u00e3o na composi\u00e7\u00e3o do ?uido.\n\nNa primeira parte desta tese, um experimento de superf\u00edcie livre foi projetado\npara reproduzir escoamentos super?ciais sobre um fundo m\u00f3vel, com o objetivo de\nestudar propriedades n\u00e3o-permanentes do transporte de sedimentos. Um sistema\nde medi\u00e7\u00e3o foi projetado e constru\u00eddo com o intuito de medir quase instanta-\nneamente a vaz\u00e3o solida e suas correla\u00e7\u00f5es com as propriedades hidr\u00e1ulicas do\nescoamento. Este aparato \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m utilizado para observar a in?u\u00eancia de in-\nstabilidades de superf\u00edcie livre sobre o transporte. Um conjunto de resultados\n\u00e9 apresentado e analisado e mostra que a presen\u00e7a de ondas pode, em m\u00e9dia,\nreduzir a quantidade total de sedimentos transportada.\n\nNa segunda parte desta tese, a din\u00e2mica de escoamentos com elevada concen-\ntra\u00e7\u00e3o de sedimentos \u00e9 estudada. Neste trabalho, executa-se a aplica\u00e7\u00e3o de um\nmodelo de primeira ordem de roll waves para ?uidos de reologia Herschel-Bulkley\npara simular um evento natural registrado na literatura.

Elles sont le r\u00e9sultats de la convolution des param\u00e8tres m\u00e9t\u00e9o-\nrologique, g\u00e9ologique/g\u00e9omorphologie et anthropique. Cette th\u00e8se, ?nanc\u00e9e\npar le gouvernement br\u00e9silien, se situe dans ce contexte g\u00e9n\u00e9ral li\u00e9 aux\nrisques naturels. Dans les derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, le Br\u00e9sil a \u00e9t\u00e9 l'h\u00f4te de nom-\nbreux \u00e9v\u00e9nements naturels tels que des inondations et des glissements de\nterrain (Pinho et al., 2013). A la saison des pluies, entre les mois de d\u00e9cem-\nbre et de f\u00e9vrier, la r\u00e9gion de la Serra do Mar, une r\u00e9gion montagneuse\n\u00e0 forte d\u00e9clivit\u00e9 appartenant aux d\u00e9partements du Sud-Ouest br\u00e9silien, a\nsubi un type d'\u00e9v\u00e9nement naturel qui est souvent la cause de catastrophe:\nles coul\u00e9es de boue. Les catastrophes qui y ont eu lieu sont consid\u00e9r\u00e9 par le\ngouvernement br\u00e9silien comme les plus grandes qu'est subi le pays. A titre\nd'exemple, nous faisons appel aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements de la r\u00e9gion coti\u00e8re du d\u00e9-\npartement de Rio de Janeiro en 2011 (Guidugli et al., 2012) et de S\u00e3o Paulo\n(voir Figure 1.1). Dans cette th\u00e8se, des aspects de ce type de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne\nsont \u00e9tudi\u00e9s.\n\nLes coul\u00e9es de boue peuvent avoir di?\u00e9rentes \u00e9volutions, mais deux m\u00e9-\ncanismes principaux sont mis en avant:\n\n\u2022 d\u00e9stabilisation de la pente satur\u00e9 d'eau, et liqu\u00e9faction abrupte du\nsol, ce qui forme un front de masse \u00e0 haut d\u00e9bit ?uide;\n\n\u2022 incorporation graduelle de mati\u00e8re s\u00e9dimentaire au sein de l'\u00e9coulement,\nqui peut, selon la g\u00e9om\u00e9trie, augmenter d\u00fb \u00e0 l'union des a?uents,\njusqu'\u00e0 ce que le ?uide devienne tr\u00e8s charg\u00e9 en s\u00e9diments.\n\nxxii\n\n\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9tendu\n\nDans le cadre de cette th\u00e8se, nous nous int\u00e9ressons au deuxi\u00e8me cas,\nque nous appelons les coul\u00e9es de boue graduellement d\u00e9velopp\u00e9es. Ce type\nd'\u00e9volution d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement peut alors \u00eatre d\u00e9crit par quatre \u00e9tapes (voir\nFigure 1.2):\n\nI pr\u00e9cipitations de forte intensit\u00e9 sur la topographie escarp\u00e9e. La satu-\nration rapide du sol conduit au ruissellement sur la zone;\n\nII le ruissellement sur les r\u00e9gions concaves du bassin \u00e9rode peu \u00e0 peu le\nsol, produit des ravines, et transporte de la mati\u00e8re s\u00e9dimentaire vers\nl'aval et les a?uents plus importants;\n\nIII quelque part, les ruissellements aboutissent un d\u00e9bit interm\u00e9diaire\nimportant capable d'\u00e9roder de plus en plus de s\u00e9diments;\n\nIV tr\u00e8s en aval, au pieds de la montagne, les a?uents se rejoignent et\nconstituent un \u00e9coulements tr\u00e8s charg\u00e9 en s\u00e9diments qui peut \u00eatre\nd\u00e9sormais appel\u00e9 coul\u00e9e de boue.\n\nD'apr\u00e8s les th\u00e9ories de la m\u00e9canique des ?uides, les ruissellements com-\npris dans les \u00e9tapes II et III peuvent \u00eatre \u00e9tudi\u00e9s comme des \u00e9coulements\nturbulent d'eau claire avec transport de s\u00e9diments. Le probl\u00e8me primor-\ndial dans ce cas est de conna\u00eetre la quantit\u00e9 de s\u00e9diments transport\u00e9 par\nl'\u00e9coulement. Cette mesure indiquerait la vitesse auquel le processus\n\nd'\u00e9volution se passerait (graduelle augmentation de l'entrainement de\ns\u00e9diments), et \u00e0 quel moment l'\u00e9tape IV serait aboutie. Cependant, la\npr\u00e9diction de cette quantit\u00e9 est toujours un sujet actuel dans la recherche\nscienti?que. En d'autres termes, le transport de s\u00e9diments n'est pas encore\nun ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne totalement d\u00e9voil\u00e9. \u00c9tant donn\u00e9 la nature turbulente de ces\n\u00e9coulements, plusieurs source de non-stationnarit\u00e9 peuvent \u00eatre pr\u00e9sentes.\nCes instabilit\u00e9s et leur e?ets induisent des incertitudes sur les mod\u00e8les de\nmasse solide transport\u00e9e.\n\nParall\u00e8lement, l'\u00e9tape IV est caract\u00e9ris\u00e9e par un \u00e9coulement plus dense,\no\u00f9 les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s visqueuse du ?uide diverge de celles de l'eau. Sur la con-\n?guration de coul\u00e9e de boue, l'\u00e9coulement est normalement laminaire et son\n\u00e9volution peut \u00eatre \u00e9tabli d'apr\u00e8s des lois du mouvement plus simples. Par\ncontre, le probl\u00e8me qui se pose est de conna\u00eetre les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de la mixture\neau-s\u00e9diments, un probl\u00e8me fortement \u00e9tudi\u00e9 dans la litt\u00e9rature (Coussot,\n1994; Ancey, 2007). Par ailleurs, certains types d'instabilit\u00e9s de surface\nlibre peuvent appara\u00eetre dans ce cas. La pr\u00e9sence d'instabilit\u00e9s au sein de\nl'\u00e9coulement va augmenter la variabilit\u00e9 spatio-temporel de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement et\n\nxxiii\n\n\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9tendu\n\nainsi intervenir les mod\u00e8les de pr\u00e9diction des caract\u00e9ristiques hydrauliques\ntels que les hauteurs de l'\u00e9coulement ou ses vitesse.\n\nCette th\u00e8se d\u00e9veloppe deux \u00e9tudes ind\u00e9pendantes, participants \u00e0 am\u00e9liorer\ndeux aspects du ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes de coul\u00e9e de boue: une \u00e9tude exp\u00e9rimentale\ndu transport s\u00e9dimentaire d'\u00e9coulements ruisselants en r\u00e9gime turbulent\net pr\u00e9sence d'ondes ; et une \u00e9tude th\u00e9orique-num\u00e9rique sur les coul\u00e9es de\nboue en r\u00e9gime laminaire instable. Le but est de comprendre comment\nles ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes instationnaires vont intervenir dans l'\u00e9volution potentielle\ncoul\u00e9e de boue.\n\nChapitre 2 - Cadre th\u00e9orique g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\n\nLes \u00e9coulements \u00e0 surface libre peuvent \u00eatre mod\u00e9lis\u00e9s math\u00e9matiquement\navec les lois de conservation de masse et de quantit\u00e9 de mouvement. Le\ntenseur de contrainte dans le ?uide est adapt\u00e9 en fonction de la concen-\ntration en s\u00e9diments dans la mixture ?uide-s\u00e9diments. Par cons\u00e9quence,\nla dynamique de l'\u00e9v\u00e9nement, turbulent ou laminaire, est fortement in?u-\nenc\u00e9 par les conditions du probl\u00e8me \u00e9tudi\u00e9 et la capacit\u00e9 de l'\u00e9coulement\n\u00e0 entra\u00eener des s\u00e9diments. Des grandeurs adimensionnelles telles comme le\nnombre de Reynolds, de Froude et de Shields sont utilis\u00e9es pour repr\u00e9senter\nces dynamiques ?uides et s\u00e9dimentaires.\n\nLe ruissellement (\u00e9coulement mince, turbulent, \u00e0 faible concentration\nde s\u00e9diments) et les coul\u00e9es de boue (\u00e9coulements laminaire \u00e0 forte con-\ncentration de s\u00e9diments) peuvent \u00eatre mis sur le m\u00eame diagramme ou les\nparam\u00e8tres en jeu sont le taux de d\u00e9formation et la concentration de solide\nau sein de la mixture (voir Figure 2.2, d'apr\u00e8s Coussot and Ancey (1999)).\nPourtant, le diagramme ne pr\u00e9voit pas le passage d'un type d'\u00e9coulement \u00e0\nl'autre. L'une des questions initiales \u00e0 l'origine de cette th\u00e8se est l'existence\nd'un passage/\u00e9volution continu entre ces deux r\u00e9gimes. Ce passage semble\npossible gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 la pente du chenal. D'apr\u00e8s Berzi and Fraccarollo (2013),\nla distribution vertical (concentration) de s\u00e9diments est contr\u00f4l\u00e9e par la\nd\u00e9clivit\u00e9 du chenal, param\u00e8tre qui joue un important r\u00f4le sur la stabilit\u00e9\nde l'\u00e9coulement. En fonction des caract\u00e9ristiques g\u00e9om\u00e9triques, du d\u00e9bit\net du ?uide, les \u00e9coulements \u00e0 surface libre peuvent \u00eatre susceptibles \u00e0 de\nd\u00e9velopper des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes d'instabilit\u00e9s de surface. Parmi les instabilit\u00e9s\npossibles, un type particulier est souvent reli\u00e9 aux \u00e9v\u00e9nements de mou-\nvement de masse: les roll waves. Il s'agit d'un train d'ondes de grandes\namplitudes qui se forme lorsque les conditions sont favorables. Ces ondes\nviennent a?ecter la dynamique du transport (Davies, 1990; Colombini and\n\nxxiv\n\n\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9tendu\n\nStocchino, 2005; Balmforth and Vakil, 2012) et la bonne pr\u00e9diction d'un\n\u00e9v\u00e9nement indispensable au dimensionnement des ouvrages et \u00e0 la s\u00e9curit\u00e9\ndes personnes et des biens autour de l'\u00e9coulement.\n\nPremi\u00e8re Partie - Le transport de s\u00e9diments au\n\nruissellement\n\nChapitre 3 - Introduction\n\nPlusieurs travaux de recherche trouv\u00e9s dans la litt\u00e9rature montrent que\nles ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes instationnaires ont un e?et important sur la dynamique\ndu transport. Les ruptures de barrage (Fraccarollo and Capart, 2002),\nl'imminence du transport (Ancey et al., 2006), les structures du lit mobile\n(Colombini and Stocchino, 2005) et les ondes de surface libre (Kranen-\nburg et al., 2013) sont quelques exemples de ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes variables dans le\ntemps et dans l'espace qui sont d\u00e9terminants. Pour \u00e9tudier ces probl\u00e8mes,\nl'approche exp\u00e9rimentale constitue un outil puissant, capable de donner des\nindices utiles \u00e0 la compr\u00e9hension des ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes physiques. Les mesures\nn\u00e9cessaires pour d\u00e9velopper l'\u00e9tude du transport instationnaire de s\u00e9diments\ndoivent \u00eatre capables de donner des informations temporelles \u00e0 la fois sur\nl'\u00e9coulement et sur transport lui-m\u00eame, \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle du ruissellement. Une\nestimation rapide de ces \u00e9chelles du probl\u00e8me permet de comprendre les\nenjeux techniques de l'ex\u00e9cution de ce travail (Amir et al., 2014).\n\nChapitre 4 - La m\u00e9thode exp\u00e9rimentale\n\nUn banc de ruissellement a \u00e9t\u00e9 con\u00e7u et construit lors de ce th\u00e8se. Ce\nbanc permet la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration des \u00e9coulement ruisselants et la mesure de ses\npropri\u00e9t\u00e9s (hauteur d'eau, d\u00e9bit massique). Le chenal a une section rectan-\ngulaire et un fond rugueux ?xe o\u00f9 l'\u00e9coulement turbulent se d\u00e9veloppe et\natteint un r\u00e9gime uniforme. A la ?n de ce fond ?xe, un lit mobile est in-\nstall\u00e9, o\u00f9 le s\u00e9diment-test est dispos\u00e9. L'\u00e9coulement turbulent \u00e9tabli arrive\nainsi au lit mobile et transporte les grains vers l'aval, o\u00f9 un pi\u00e8ge est plac\u00e9.\nCe pi\u00e8ge permet la capture des grains et leur visualisation de mani\u00e8re \u00e0\nquanti?er le transport.\n\nLes mesures plus ?nes des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'\u00e9coulement et du transport\nsolide sont faites \u00e0 l'aide des techniques d'imagerie. Un syst\u00e8me de ve-\nlocim\u00e9trie \u00e0 partir des images de traceurs (Particle Image Velocimetry\n? PIV) permet l'obtention des caract\u00e9ristiques de l'\u00e9coulement et la valida-\n\nxxv\n\n\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9tendu\n\ntion de ses propri\u00e9t\u00e9s turbulentes. Un syst\u00e8me de suivi de particules (Par-\nticle Tracking Velocimetry ? PTV) au niveau du pi\u00e8ge horizontal fournit\nles informations de d\u00e9bit solide au cours du temps. Le syst\u00e8me PTV a \u00e9t\u00e9\ncon\u00e7u en prenant comme base les exp\u00e9riences rapport\u00e9s dans la litt\u00e9rature\npar Frey et al. (2003). La m\u00e9thodologie PTV permet obtenir la vitesse des\nparticules pi\u00e9g\u00e9es et ainsi le d\u00e9bit solide (voir \u00e9quation 4.20 et 4.24). Pour\n\u00e9tudier les \u00e9coulements perturb\u00e9s (\u00e9coulements o\u00f9 il y a le passage d'ondes\nde surface libre), un syst\u00e8me de batteur a \u00e9t\u00e9 install\u00e9 en amont du chenal,\nil permet la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration de perturbation \u00e0 des fr\u00e9quences contr\u00f4l\u00e9es. Une\nanalyse des r\u00e9sultats de la m\u00e9thode est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e pour valider la qualit\u00e9 des\nr\u00e9sultats obtenus. L'in?uence des propri\u00e9t\u00e9s des grains, de la qualit\u00e9 des\nimages et du signal obtenu sont \u00e9valu\u00e9s.\n\nChapitre 5 - L'e?et de la turbulence sur le transport de s\u00e9diments\n\nUne s\u00e9rie de r\u00e9sultats exp\u00e9rimentaux est pr\u00e9sent\u00e9e o\u00f9 les caract\u00e9ristiques du\ntransport solide sont mise en avance. Trois \u00e9tudes principales sont men\u00e9es:\nle d\u00e9bit moyen en fonction du nombre de Shields; les distributions spectrales\nde puissance des signaux; l'intensit\u00e9 des ?uctuations du transport solide.\n\nL'intensit\u00e9 des ?uctuations du transport solide montrent le m\u00eame type\nde loi empirique que celle utilis\u00e9e pour le d\u00e9bit solide moyen quand on les\nrelie aux intensit\u00e9s de ?uctuations de la vitesse de frottement. la derni\u00e8re\nanalyse port\u00e9e sur les ?uctuations de d\u00e9bit solide, illustr\u00e9 par la ?gure 5.11,\npermet de conclure que loin du seuil de mise en transport (Sh > 4Shc),\nle niveau de ?uctuations est \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s constant et suis les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de\nl'\u00e9coulement moyen.\n\nL'analyse sur les propri\u00e9t\u00e9s moyennes montrent que les mesures sont\nen accord avec des lois empiriques classiques de la litt\u00e9rature (Meyer-Peter\nand M\u00fcller, 1948; Wong and Parker, 2006) (voir Figure 5.10). Une analyse\ndes densit\u00e9s spectrales de puissance (PSD) permet trouver de mettre en\n\u00e9vidence la sensibilit\u00e9 du transport aux propri\u00e9t\u00e9s de l'\u00e9coulement proche\nde la paroi. Pour les \u00e9coulements proches du seuil de mise en mouvement\n(Sh &lt;2.5Shc), on aper\u00e7oit une loi de d\u00e9croissance des PSD \u00e0 la puissance\n?1 avec la fr\u00e9quence. Ce r\u00e9sultat serait en concordance avec d'autres de la\nlitt\u00e9rature qui pr\u00e9voyaient que le transport par charriage est contr\u00f4l\u00e9 par\nles structures turbulentes proches de la paroi (qui ont cette m\u00eame loi de\nd\u00e9croissance ?1). En revanche, la loi de d\u00e9croissance passe \u00e0 la puissance\n?5/3 pour les \u00e9coulements \u00e0 nombres de Shields plus forts pour lesquels\n\nxxvi\n\n\n\nR\u00e9sum\u00e9 \u00e9tendu\n\nles perturbations tridimensionnelles du lit mobile sont plus fortes (voir ??).\nM\u00eame si le transport solide se fait par charriage, ces r\u00e9sultats montrent\nque, lors de la pr\u00e9sence des structures morphologiques du lit, la dynamique\nturbulente contr\u00f4le les ?uctuations du transport solide.\n\nChapitre 6 - \u00c9coulement perturb\u00e9\n\nA l'aide du batteur plac\u00e9 en amont, une perturbation de la surface libre\nest g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e et les mesures sont analys\u00e9s de la m\u00eame fa\u00e7on qu'au chapitre\npr\u00e9c\u00e9dent. L'analyse de la quantit\u00e9 moyenne de masse transport\u00e9e indique\nqu'il y a une diminution de la capacit\u00e9 de transport de l'\u00e9coulement ().\nPour un nombre de Shields donn\u00e9, l'\u00e9coulement perturb\u00e9 a un d\u00e9bit solide\nmoyen moins important que l'\u00e9coulement stationnaire non perturb\u00e9. Nous\ndiscutons les possibles causes de ce ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne en s'appuyant sur r\u00e9sul-\ntats dans la litt\u00e9rature pour le pro?l de frottement d'un \u00e9coulement avec la\npresence des instabilit\u00e9s de surface libre type roll waves. Nous montrons le\nfrottement moyen lors du passage d'une onde d\u00e9croit et est plus faible que\nce de l'\u00e9coulement moyen. Les densit\u00e9s spectrales de puissance ne pr\u00e9sen-\ntent aucun changement signi?catif par rapport aux intensit\u00e9s et aux loi de\nd\u00e9croissance trouv\u00e9es pour l'\u00e9coulement pas perturb\u00e9. Elles corroborent les\nr\u00e9sultats pr\u00e9c\u00e9dents.\n\nDeuxi\u00e8me Partie - Les \u00e9coulements non-Newtoniens sur\n\nun sol naturel\n\nChapitre 7 - Introduction\n\nDans cette deuxi\u00e8me partie de la th\u00e8se, un travail d'ing\u00e9nierie est initiale-\nment engag\u00e9 pour appliquer un mod\u00e8le math\u00e9matique \u00e0 la pr\u00e9vision d'un\n\u00e9v\u00e9nement naturel.

L'obtention des\nparam\u00e8tres d'entr\u00e9es est l'une des t\u00e2ches les plus importantes. Vu qu'il\ns'agit d'un mod\u00e8le laminaire, les caract\u00e9ristiques du ?uide vont avoir une\nimportance cruciale sur les r\u00e9sultats.

They usually start on steep hillsides as soil\nslumps or slides that liquefy and accelerate to speeds as great as\n35 miles (56 km) per hour. Multiple debris ?ows that start high\nin canyons commonly funnel into channels. There, they merge,\ngain volume, and travel long distances from their source.\n\nUnited States Geological Survey Fact Sheet FS-071-00\nMay 2000\n\n1.1 Introduction\n\nNatural hazards, generally speaking, can be described as the result from\nthe interaction between natural phenomena and vulnerable human societies.\nThey are the convolution of meteorological, geological/geomorphological ef-\nfects with anthropic actions leading to damages perceived by society. They\nemerge as worldwide events, result as the interaction between many factors\nsuch as global warming, landscape usage and misguided urban management,\nwhich happens to a?ect every part of the globe (Burton, 2005). More specif-\nically, in Brazil, people have confronted successive natural events such as\n?oods and landslides year after year during the rainy season (Pinho et al.,\n2013). In South and Southeast regions, another kind of mass movement\nevent also takes place: mud?ows. It usually happens during the rainy sea-\nson and over Serra do Mar, the mountain range that extends along the shore\n(Guidicini and Nieble, 1984). According to Brazilian Ministry of Science\nand Technology, landslides and mud?ows are the greatest cause of death\n\n3\n\n\n\n1. Natural flows and risks\n\namong all Brazilian natural hazards.\n\nAs matter of meteorological phenomena, on the Southeast Region of\nBrazil, a particular one takes place during the warm season called South\nAtlantic Convergence Zone - SACZ (Zona de Converg\u00eancia do Atl\u00e2ntico\nSul), which is often responsible for hazardous events in the country. It\nappears mostly late spring and during summer and is responsible for high\nprecipitation levels, around 200 mm in a couple of hours. This phenomenon\nis represented by a local maximum level in cloudiness and precipitation\nacross an elongated axis oriented in a Northwest-Southeast manner over\nSouth Amaz\u00f4nia, Southeast and West-Center Brazilian regions reaching\nthe Atlantic Ocean.\n\n(a) Caraguatatuba, 1967. (b) Teres\u00f3polis, 2011.\n\nFigure 1.1: Photos from Brazilian largest natural hazards.\n\nThe topography of the region a?ected by SACZ helps maintaining the\nstrength of the event, mainly on the Southeast region where a mountains\nrange called Serra do Mar blocks the passage of clouds. Exactly in this\nregion we ?nd the Rio de Janeiro's state mountain region where a massive\nhazard took place in 2011. Heavy rains (200 to 300 mm in just few hours)\nconsiderably reduced cohesiveness of the thin layer of soil, allowing an enor-\nmous volume of muddy material to ?ow down the hills and devastate areas\ndownstream. Clearly, the mis-occupation and anthropic action were impor-\ntant factors for the dramatic consequences. According to statement released\nby Civil Defense of Rio de Janeiro State, on January 28th, 8.777 homeless,\nmore than 20 thousand dislodged, 950 dead and 430 missing people were\nestimated (Guidugli et al., 2012). This last event is now considered as the\nlargest Brazilian natural hazard since the event of Caraguatatuba city, in\n\n4\n\n\n\n1.1. Introduction\n\nMarch 1967. At that time, S\u00e3o Paulo state northern coast faced a long\nrainy period; rivers over?owed and were strong enough to drag trees and\ncivil constructions in ?ooded zones; mud and rocks fell down the hills on\nsuccessive landslides burying entire houses. The event resulted in great\n?nancial losses and death of 500 people (Rebello et al., 2012), thus point-\ning out the importance of researching such matter in order to avoid such\ndisastrous consequences from happening again. Both events are shown on\nFigure 1.1. Correctly developing models and predicting evolution of such\nevents might help stakeholders to better estimate risks and ?nd more argu-\nments to develop more e?cient policies.\n\nMud?ows are mass movement events that are triggered by intense rain-\nfall and usually start in the upper part of mountains where slopes are\nstronger. One important feature from ?owing ?uid is that it is basically\ncomposed by water with high concentration of sediments (thus di?erent\nviscous properties). The source material that constitute the ?owing mate-\nrial comes from the soil, basically sediment from di?erent origins (silt, clay\nand sand in di?erent concentrations). The mixture have then high density\nwhich combined with strong slopes, leads to an extremely rapid ?ow with\nhigh kinetic energy and considerable high velocity (mean velocity 5 m/s (18\nkm/h), up to 10 m/s (36 km/h) (Hungr et al., 2001) ).\n\nAs far as it is known, gravity-driven mass movement are far to be com-\npletely understood by scienti?c community. The knowledge of such kind of\n?ow is clearly necessary to enhance prevention tools for Engineering when\napplied to modeling natural events such as mud?ows, mud ?oods and de-\nbris ?ow. Two main scenarios for mud?ows generation can be described\n(Oliveira and Brito, 1998; Chambon et al., 2010):\n\n\u2022 sudden ?uidi?cation of saturated soil after complete fail of slopes,\nleading to a massive discharge of solid material at once;\n\n\u2022 gradual incorporation of soil into tributaries from the watershed, from\nupstream to downstream the basin, which can join greater streams and\nincrease in discharge and erosion, thus gradually leading to a stream\nof muddy material.\n\nThe ?rst, which we should call here suddenly developed mud?ow, can be\nanalogously compared to a dam-break event in which a ?uid is suddenly\nreleased and moves rapidly downstream. The second, gradually developed\nmud?ow have a slower evolution, maturing along the watershed, incorporat-\ning sediment material and changing its dynamics. In this work, the second\n\n5\n\n\n\n1. Natural flows and risks\n\nscenario is explored. As a hydro-geological process, three main features can\nbe identi?ed in the study of mud?ows formation:\n\n\u2022 rainfall duration and intensity;\n\n\u2022 soil characteristics;\n\n\u2022 topography.\n\nRainfall is the triggering mechanism for mass movements such as mud-\n?ows, lahar ?ows, and landslides. For landslides, for example, a stable soil\nlayer saturates with water during a rainy event, acquiring a certain level\nof ?uidity. Eventually, if the ?uidity level is high enough, the soil will fail\nand move. This kind of event could be present during a suddenly devel-\noped mud?ow, contributing to the increase in sediment concentration in\nthe ?ow. Rainfall also relates to runo? discharge, directly related to ?ow\ncapacity of transporting sediments in soil. For such scenario, there is an\nincrease in momentum, therefore kinetic energy, related to the ?ow which\nis established over a saturated soil, as veri?ed by Iverson et al. (2011). In\nany case, natural vegetation cover and land use (arable ?elds, pastures, soil\nsealing, etc.) also a?ect ?ow friction laws, becoming a great issue in regions\nwithout proper sustainable environmental management.\n\n1.2 Phenomenological description\n\nThe gradually developed mud?ow event scenario can be separated in four\nmain stages:\n\nI high intensity rainfall over a steep topography. Increased water ab-\nsorption by soil and fast saturation of it leads rapidly to runo?;\n\nII initial runo? is established in concave areas from the watershed and\nerodes its way down in gullies, transporting ?ne materials down-\nstream, reaching greater tributaries;\n\nIII intermediary runo? continuously erode the soil, increasing in solid\nconcentration and discharge, forming sometimes ravines and/or creeks;\n\nIV rainfall peak is reached and the result of the uni?cation of tributaries\nforms of a main stream with increased discharge and high sediment\nconcentration, achieving the status of mud?ow.\n\n6\n\n\n\n1.2. Phenomenological description\n\nFigure 1.2: Illustration of process for gradually developed mud?ow event.\n\n7\n\n\n\n1. Natural flows and risks\n\nFrom a mechanical approach, the runo? ?ow established during the ini-\ntial and intermediary stage can be de?ned, in most of the cases, as turbulent\n?ow of almost clean water. Sometimes, in the presence of vegetation, con-\nstriction of paths and even topography (convex areas), the ?ow can be thin\nand/or narrow, creating a thin layer of ?ow with intermediary dynamic be-\ntween laminar and turbulent (Strahler, 1952). Due to the increased slope,\nmean ?ow velocities are su?ciently strong to have considerable capacity of\ntransporting ?ne sediment material.\n\nDepending on ?ow dynamics and sediment properties, transport mode\nof sediment in such ?ows can achieve di?erent forms: sediment can rest in\ncontact with the bottom (bed load), eventually jump and/or project itself\ninto the ?ow (saltation), or completely be carried away by ?ow (suspension).\nFor runo?, transport mechanisms of ?ne sediments are mainly bedload and\nsaltation, sometimes praising suspension when ?ow occurs over clayey soil.\nHowever, as ?ow discharge in gullies are relatively small, volume concen-\ntration of solid in ?uid do not exceed 8% in the composition of the ?uid,\nthus keeping it as a Newtonian ?uid (Graf and Altinakar, 2000).\n\nIn the last stage, the established mud?ow usually diverge its viscous\nproperties from the initial stage, since the increase in discharge made pos-\nsible to carry more sediments along with ?ow. Despite the relatively high\nvelocity achieved in such ?ows, they are usually laminar, with a completely\ndi?erent dynamic from the initial and intermediary stage (Coussot, 1994;\nCoussot and Piau, 1994).\n\nSome questions may arise when dealing with those natural event such\nas:\n\n\u2022 mud?ow success of generation, i.e. whether the three main features\nsaid before (rainfall, soil and topography) convolute to lead to a so to\nspeak mud?ow event;\n\n\u2022 once the event is established, what would be the properties of ?nal\nstage event (?ow and ?uid properties);\n\nThe ?rst addressed question can sometimes be answered for suddenly\ngenerated events if quanti?ed values are obtained for the three main fea-\ntures involved in the mud?ow generation (precipitation, soil and topogra-\nphy). With su?cient information about the soil, one can determine how\nmuch water will ?ow over the surface and how much will be the seepage of\n\n8\n\n\n\n1.2. Phenomenological description\n\nwater through the soil. Given the topography, it is possible to run models\nof stability and determine whether dislodge volume of solid and water will\nform a ?continuous? ?ux of mud along the basin (Luna et al., 2011; Gomes\net al., 2008; van Asch et al., 2007).\n\nHowever, the gradually generated events scenario is theoretically ?weaker?,\nwith a ?ow that has a hypothetic maximum capacity of transport sediment\nmaterial (Graf and Altinakar, 2000). Thus, the sediment transport during\nruno? has to be properly estimated to allow correctly prediction on how\nfast ?ow dynamics would change (from turbulent clean water to laminar\nmuddy ?uid ?ow). Of course this matter also depends on topography and\nincrease in discharge (so ?ow capacity of transport would increase), but\npredictions on sediment transport for free surface ?ows are still a matter\nof discussion in the scienti?c community and this work takes part on such\nmatter and addresses the e?ect of ?uctuations of ?ow dynamic properties\non the transport.\n\nIn the other hand, ?ow and ?uid properties in the ?nal stage of the\nevent should be the major data required. One can relate ?ow properties\n(such as height and velocity) with energy level and thus destructive capac-\nity of events (Zeng et al., 2015) although few works seem to develop such\napproach. However, ?ow properties only make sense as long as we know\nwhat ?uid we are dealing with. In fact, ?uid properties generally indicate\nhow ?ow will behave, thus pointing out that they must be primarily quan-\nti?ed to estimate ?ow properties. We must recall that ?uid properties of\nmixtures must be studied from a rheological point of view which shows\nthat such muddy material behave very di?erently from water. Apart from\nthe ?uid itself, the geometry of the channel and its properties also play an\nimportant role to determine ?ow properties. Nevertheless, ?ow properties\nare not restrict to mean values. Usually in natural events, many types of\nunsteady phenomena can have place during the event.\n\nFor the initial runo? stage, given the turbulent nature of the ?ow, many\nare the sources responsible for non-stationary phenomena and unsteadi-\nness. The turbulent ?uctuations present in such ?ows are themselves an\nimportant source of time and spatial variations of velocity property. It is\nknown that sediment transport occurring due to steady and uniform turbu-\nlent ?ows do present variability of solid discharge (Frey et al., 2003; Ancey\net al., 2008). Free surface ?ows such as those can be easily disturbed (by\ntopography, rain, etc.) and lead to formation of surface instabilities (i.e.\nvariation of ?ow properties along time and space). Di?erently from empiri-\n\n9\n\n\n\n1. Natural flows and risks\n\ncal laws established for steady and permanent ?ows, transport phenomenon\ndoesn't happen the same way, as signi?cant variations of stress applied over\ngrains are identi?ed and grains develop horizontal acceleration. Conversely,\nrecalling the suddenly developed mud?ows, it is possible to model it as a\ndam break ?ow, in which an abrupt variation of ?ow properties is propagate\ndownstream.\n\nSpecially, a particular kind of free surface instability can appear in both\nscenarios, runo? and mud?ow. This instability, usually called roll wave, is\nde?ned as steep periodic surges, propagating downstream in stabilized form,\ni.e. with constant wave properties (amplitude, wavelength and propagation\nvelocity). Such waves appear naturally if ?ow conditions are favorable and\nrandom disturbances applied to ?ow by environment are inside a proper\nrange. Low/high disturbances are ampli?ed/damped until permanent con-\n?guration is reached, after traveling a certain channel length. Such waves\nreceive a particular name called roll waves.\n\nFrom the hydraulic perspective, regarding turbulent ?ows, these waves\nappear like hydraulic jumps, i.e. transitions between ?uvial to torrential\n?ow. Widely known, such structure is highly dissipative and could in-\nduce many di?erent levels of risks depending on nearby civil infrastructure.\nWhen present in runo?, less is known about roll waves, whether they appear,\nif they contribute to the sediment transport, or how they interact in the for-\nmation of gullies and ravines. They can be perceived as non-constant ?ow\nbut how such feature interacts with the mobile bed structure still rests not\ncompletely understood. Much more is known about roll waves in mud?ows.\nZanuttigh and Lamberti (2007) for example summarizes much of what is\nfound in the literature about such events. The challenge however is: ?rst,\napproximate models to the realistic problem, given its complexity; second,\nassociate its presence with risks incurred by endangered societies. Despite\nof the fact that no proof of roll waves appearance have been noticed on\nBrazilian territory, other countries like New Zealand, China, Switzerland\nand Italy have already con?rmed presence of surges and wave trains on\nmud?ows over mountain regions (Zanuttigh and Lamberti, 2007).\n\n10\n\n\n\n1.3. Objectives\n\n1.3 Objectives\n\nThe question addressed in this research is an issue that interest not only\nBrazilian Government1 but world communities: how unsteady ?ow dy-\nnamical properties (from turbulence or roll waves) would change\nthe evolution of one potential mud?ow? Upstream, when runo? takes\nplace, how turbulent properties a?ect the variability found in total amount\nof sediment transport? Furthermore, how would surface instabilities (spe-\ncially roll waves) change (or not) sediment transport dynamics? And down-\nstream, where mud?ow is developed, can we satisfactorily predict roll waves\nproperties based on the most realistic scenario? The answer to these ques-\ntions should help understand how important are such hydraulic instabilities\nfor a precise evaluation of a potential mud?ow event. From an Engineer-\ning perspective, the better we know about a problem and time-dependent\nphenomena that are related to it, the more precisely we can predict those\nevents characteristics and thus optimize process, design structures, and re-\nduce social and ?nancial losses.\n\nThis thesis brings a work that will try to answer these questions by two\ndi?erent approaches on two di?erent stages of an event:\n\n\u2022 a laboratory experiment for turbulent open-channel ?ow over a mo-\nbile bed of sediments, looking for the source of sediment transport\nvariations and trying to understand what happen when surfaces in-\nstabilities are present;\n\n\u2022 a second approach will study roll waves main properties from a the-\noretical approach, based on the mud?ow con?guration, ?owing down\nan inclined porous bed, and will try to verify the validity of such\nmodel based on in situ measurements.\n\nThis thesis brings then two parts concerning each of the approaches pre-\nviously explained. The ?rst part will detail the experimental methodology\nused in this work in order to obtain ?ow and sediment transport properties\nover time. Such information allowed some further investigations on the re-\nlations between both and show how mean and ?uctuating ?ow properties\nare related to mean and ?uctuating solid transport properties. The e?ects\nof free surface instabilities over the solid transport is then analyzed. The\nsecond part brings an application of roll waves mathematical model to a\n\n1Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00ed?co e Tecnol\u00f3gico - CNPq - is the\nBrazilian Government Institution that ?nance the author's scholarship\n\n11\n\n\n\n1. Natural flows and risks\n\nnatural event occurred in Acquabona watershed. Based on the informa-\ntions that could be gathered from the site, we show that it is possible to\nassess the amplitude of roll waves instabilities that could have been devel-\noped on that natural environment with a certain margin of error. A more\ncomplex model for the velocity pro?le is then proposed, considering the\nporosity of the bed. The test-case is again evaluated. In the third part, we\nbring discussions about the results presented and some perspectives of this\nwork.\n\n12\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nPhysical and mathematical review\n\n2.1 Introduction\n\nAs addressed in the introductory part, when looking for gradually developed\nmud?ows, two di?erent scenarios are at stake during its evolution: the\nruno?, where initial sediment transport is observed; and mud?ow, a ?ow\nof aqueous mixture of solid sediment particles. Considering the following\ngeometry for the channel in both scenarios:\n\n\u2022 rectangular cross-sectional;\n\n\u2022 slope angle of ? degrees;\n\n\u2022 long waves approximation - longitudinal characteristic length L0 is\nmuch greater than cross-sectional l0 or vertical h0 ones (L0 ? l0 ?\nh0);\n\n\u2022 negligible friction on the lateral walls1 - cross-sectional characteristic\nlength l0 is much greater than vertical one (l0 ? h0);\n\nSchematically, the representation of such ?ow would be as shown in Fig-\nure 2.1. Characteristics properties of ?ow are: ?ow discharge Q (m3s?1);\nmean ?ow height h0 (m); mean ?ow velocity u0 (ms\n\n?1); speci?c ?ow dis-\ncharge (m2s?1),\n\nq = Q/l0 = h0u0. (2.1)\n\n1This hypothesis requires that channel width should be at least 20 times much larger\nthan ?ow height.\n\n13\n\n\n\n2. Physical and mathematical review\n\nl0\n\nh0\n\nL\n\n?\n\nx\n\nFigure 2.1: Schematic representation of a three-dimensional open-channel ?ow\nand the geometrical characteristics of interest in such problems.\n\nThe equations that govern the problem are mass and momentum con-\nservation equations (Chassaing, 2010):\n\n??\n\n?t\n+\n?(?ui)\n\n?xi\n= 0; (2.2a)\n\n??ui\n?t\n\n+\n?(?uiuj)\n\n?xj\n= ?Fi +\n\n??ij\n?xj\n\n, (2.2b)\n\nwhere i,j = 1, 2, 3 are index that identify components of spatial coordinates\nxi; t is the time variable; ui are components of velocity ?eld; Fi are com-\nponents of body forces; ?ij represents the components of the stress tensor;\nand ? is the ?uid density.\n\nSince dealing with open-channel ?ows, the only body force acting on\nthe problem is the gravity, represented by its acceleration gi. The in?u-\nence of gravity on each direction depend on the slope. Fluid is considered\nincompressible. The stress tensor, symmetrical, can be separated on nor-\nmal and shear stress components. The former is represented by pressure\nP (scalar), that acts uniformly on every direction. The latter, by the vis-\ncous forces, represented by ?ij which vary depending on the ?uid rheology.\nMathematically:\n\n?ij = ?P?ij + ?ij, (2.3)\n\nwhere ?ij is the Kronecker delta (unit tensor) such that ?ij is 1 if i = j and\n0 if i 6= j.\n\nFluid density and viscous stress tensor should depend on the volumetric\nconcentration of particles ?v in the ?uid mixture, so that ?(?v) and ?ij(?v),\nbut then again, ?v is constant during a process. At this point, we should\nremember the Reynolds number, which represents the ratio between inertial\nforces (represented by mean ?ow velocity u0) and viscous forces, opposing\n\n14\n\n\n\n2.1. Introduction\n\nFigure 2.2: Simpli?ed diagram of ?ow regimes from Coussot and Ancey (1999)\nusing shear rate ?? and particle concentration in mixture ?v. The transitions\nbetween regimes are described using dimensionless numbers. For details of such\nnumbers, see Coussot and Ancey (1999).\n\nthe ?uid movement. The Reynolds number should assume di?erent forms\ndepending on the rheological approach given to the ?uid. Then, the two\nscenarios at stake can be di?erentiated based on two main features: con-\ncentrations of particles in the ?uid; and ?ow shear rate, ?? = ?ui/?xj. Such\ncategorization is summarized in the work from Coussot and Ancey (1999)\nby Figure 2.2. For the runo? stage, concentration of particles should be\nlow (?v &lt;1%), than the viscosity is the viscosity of the interstitial ?uid\n(water, ? 10?3 Pas). High shear rate is noticed (?? ? 102 s?1)2, thus ?t-\nting into region (D). For mud?ow stage, high concentration of particles will\nchange ?uid rheology and ?ow dynamics, increasing viscous e?ects, reduc-\ning shear rate (?? ? 100 s?1), thus ?tting to region (B). Many e?ects are\nneglected in the approach undertaken in this work such as the presence of\ncolloidal substances, temperature gradient, and hard suspensions (promi-\nnent particle-particle interactions). Both regions of interest here, (B) and\n(D), are governed by ?uid mechanics laws such as Equations 2.2a and 2.2b,\npreviously presented. The evolution of properties from a ?ow from region\n\n2combination of low viscosity and high shear rate leads to great Reynolds number -\nTurbulent ?ow.\n\n15\n\n\n\n2. Physical and mathematical review\n\n(D) to region (B) however is not quite well understand. Many e?ects could\nbe present during a natural event that can change the path of transition.\nFor example, the ?ow capacity of transport is related to the ?ow discharge\nand characteristics of soil particles. Any variation of geometry and/or ?ow\ndischarge would change the overall ?ow capacity, thus also changing the\nparticle entrainment rate. Nevertheless many time-variable e?ects appear\nwhich somehow are supposed to a?ect the ?ow dynamics and its interac-\ntion with sediment transport. Such kind of events require a more speci?c\napproach. One among them is the roll waves instabilities, which are con-\nsidered in this work, as will be shown.\n\nUsing the hypothesis presented before (incompressibility of ?uid and\n?ow) and the form stress tensor (Equation 2.3), the conservations equations\ncan be rewritten as:\n\n?ui\n?xi\n\n= 0; (2.4a)\n\n?ui\n?t\n\n+ ui\n?uj\n?xj\n\n= ?\n1\n\n?\n\n?P\n\n?xi\n+ gi +\n\n1\n\n?\n\n??ij\n?xj\n\n. (2.4b)\n\nTo summarize the evolution of a gradually developed mud?ow, one\nshould assume for example a longitudinal line from watershed, as illus-\ntrates 2.3(a), starting one end at the beginning of the runo? stage and the\nother end at the consolidated mud?ow stage. Following this line, discharge\nin the stream will continuously increase. Consequently, ?ow erosion ca-\npacity will also increase and so the quantity of solid sediments entrained.\nWhat could be observed, schematically, would correspond to the 2.3(b). A\nclear water ?ow, turbulent and Newtonian, where particles initiate their\nmovement, that continuously su?ers increase of discharge and transport ca-\npacity (a?ecting particles entrainment/transport), incorporating sediment\nmaterial on the ?uid (changing ?v), until reach a maximum concentration\nof particles in the ?uid mixture for the conditions at stake. Such change in\nconcentration could be able to lead to a change in ?uid rheological proper-\nties and consequently in ?ow dynamics (Coussot and Meunier, 1996; Graf\nand Altinakar, 2000). If this evolution is successful, the ?ow would now be\nlaminar and non-Newtonian.\n\nIn the speci?c literature for mass movements, the rheological classi?ca-\ntion of an event would depend basically on the fraction of ?ne sediments to\nthe total volumetric concentration of solid sediments (Figure 2.4), as pro-\nposed by Coussot and Meunier (1996). Then, when ?ow capacity Celik and\nRodi (1991) is low, sediments are entrained close to the bottom. Two-phase\n\n16\n\n\n\n2.1.

As\n?ow discharge increases, more and more particles are entrained and in-\ncorporated to mixture, especially ?ne sediments which are easily washed\ndownstream. This would change the overall dynamics of the ?uid, and ?ow\nis frequently modeled as equivalent one-phase ?ow.\n\nFigure 2.4: Classi?cation of mass movements on steep slopes as a function of\nsolid fraction and material type.

Physical and mathematical review\n\n2.2 Turbulent ?ow and sediment transport\n\nOn open-channel hydraulics, sediment transport is a matter of study that\nhave great interest due to its importance to the environment. Informations\nsuch as quantity of solid material transported by ?ow and properties of\nbedform structures are the main concerns of that matter of study.\n\nFlows occurring over large surfaces, with a small ?ow height, are a com-\nmon scenario where sediment transport is established. Rain pouring over\nsedimentary or non-sedimentary soils induce the formation of preferential\n?ow paths, usually of small height (&lt;10 mm), even when compared to its\nwidth. This kind of ?ow is called runo? and is one of the most common\n?ow of water cycle on Earth surface. As shows Figure 2.5, such kind of ?ow\nis present in many environments, arti?cial or natural, changed or not by\nhuman interference.\n\n2.2.1 Flow hydraulics\n\nRuno?s are usually turbulent, composed by water with very small con-\ncentrations of particles, and have a considerable capacity of transporting\nsediment material and pollutants. Depending on ?ow dynamics and sed-\niments grain size distribution, transport mode of sediment can vary from\nbed load (for coarse and ?ne sands), praise saltation and reptation regimes\n(for ?ne sands and silt) and even reach intrinsic suspension mode (for clay\nand pollutants).\n\nFor runo? ?ows, shallow clear water ?ow occurs over a mobile bed. The\n?uid being Newtonian, the viscous stress tensor is:\n\n?ij = \u00b5\n\n(\n?ui\n?xj\n\n+\n?uj\n?xi\n\n)\n, (2.5)\n\nwhere \u00b5 is the ?uid dynamic viscosity3.\n\nAt this point, we can de?ne the Reynolds number for this kind of ?uid:\n\nRe =\n4?h0u0\n\u00b5\n\n. (2.6)\n\nFor turbulent ?ow, Re > 2000. Considering the geometrical hypothesis\nbefore (section 2.1), the ?ow could be modeled as one-dimensional, and\n\n3The dilation/compression e?ects are neglected, ?ui/?xi = 0\n\n18\n\n\n\n2.2. Turbulent ?ow and sediment transport\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d)\n\nFigure 2.5: Examples of runo? ?ows in di?erent environments. 2.5(a): runo? on\npaved street; 2.5(b): runo? on mountain region; 2.5(c): runo? in vegetable area;\n2.5(d): runo? occurring on agriculture zone.\n\nconsidering the ?ow dynamic is turbulent, the problem is ?simpli?ed? into\nthe following system:\n\n?u\n\n?x\n+\n?w\n\n?z\n= 0; (2.7a)\n\n?u\n\n?t\n+ u\n\n?u\n\n?x\n+ v\n\n?u\n\n?y\n= ?\n\n1\n\n?\n\n(\n?P\n\n?x\n\n)\n+ gx + ?\n\n(\n?2u\n\n?x2\n+\n?2u\n\n?y2\n\n)\n; (2.7b)\n\n?v\n\n?t\n+ u\n\n?v\n\n?x\n+ v\n\n?v\n\n?y\n= ?\n\n1\n\n?\n\n(\n?P\n\n?y\n\n)\n+ gy + ?\n\n(\n?2v\n\n?y2\n+\n?2y\n\n?y2\n\n)\n; (2.7c)\n\nwhere u and v are instantaneous longitudinal and vertical velocity compo-\nnents and ? = \u00b5/? represents the kinematic ?uid viscosity. The velocity\ncan be decomposed in mean and ?uctuating variables:\n\nui(xj, t) = u?i(xj, t) + u\n?\ni(xj, t), (2.8)\n\n19\n\n\n\n2. Physical and mathematical review\n\nwhere u?i represents the statistical mean value over time and u\n?\ni the ?uctu-\n\nations. In permanent and steady conditions, further simpli?cations of the\nproblem can be performed through the boundary layer theory (Schlichting,\n1979). The problem is solved and the law of the wall (Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, 1930)\nis reached so that we obtain ?ow velocity pro?le u?(y), with a negligible\nmean vertical velocity and a mean longitudinal velocity depending on the\nvertical component y. In that theory, two di?erent zones are presented: one\nwhere the drag comes mainly from ?uid viscosity (viscous sublayer - small\nscale/molecular), close to the walls; and another far from the wall where\nviscosity is negligible and only turbulent dissipation can be considered (log-\nlaw region). The problem is scaled to the speci?c velocity u? called friction\nvelocity where\n\nu? =\n\n?\n?b\n?\n, (2.9)\n\nand ?b is the shear stress applied to the walls/bottom. When in steady and\npermanent con?guration for a ?at bed, hydrostatic conditions are reached.\nThe bottom shear stress can be written as function of the water column:\n\n?b = ?gh0 sin ?. (2.10)\n\nThe scaling is done as:\n\nu+ =\nu\n\nu?\n; (2.11a)\n\ny+ =\nu?\n?\ny. (2.11b)\n\n.\nThen the velocity pro?le present the behavior illustrated on Figure 2.6.\n\nThe ?ow velocity pro?le u(y) assumes di?erent form depending on each\nzone of the boundary layer. For the viscous dominant, velocity depends\nlinearly on the vertical coordinate\n\nu+ = y+, (2.12)\n\nand for turbulent dominant region (log-law region), it follows\n\nu+ =\n1\n\n?\nlog y+ + B, (2.13)\n\nwhere ? = 0.41 is the von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant and B is an adjustment coe?-\ncient depending on the channel wall roughness.\n\n20\n\n\n\n2.2.

Black dots reproduce a typical\nvelocity pro?le.\n\n2.2.2 Sediment transport\n\nWall roughness is given based on the type of sediments that are distributed\nin the bed, their mobility and the subsequent bedform presence. Bed sed-\niments are characterized depending on their density ?s and their size (di-\nameter) D. Depending on shear rate applied by ?ow on bed particles, or\nmore precisely ?ow friction at the bed, ?ow is capable to overcome static\nstate of particles, and then to transport sediment material along with it.\nThis threshold state is related to particles geometry and submerged weight\n(Shields, 1936) (see ?gure Figure 2.7) and threshold is often related to\na minimum stress value or critical value ?c (or a critical friction velocity\nu?c (Armanini and Gregoretti, 2005)). The relation between kinetic energy\navailable on the ?ow and sediments potential energy is given by the Shield's\nnumber Sh (Equation 2.14):\n\nSh =\n?b\n\n(?s ??)gD\n> Shc, (2.14)\n\nThe minimum Shield's number is represented by Shc.\n\nOne of the factor that is included into the critical shear velocity concept\nis the sedimentation velocity vs, which represent the particles weight. The\nrelation between friction velocity and sedimentation velocity relation is also\n\n21\n\n\n\n2.

The\nempirical equation proposed by Paphitis (2001) that covers a large range of\ndimensionless grain diameter was found based on many experimental runs\ncollected from the literature:\n\nShc =\n0.273\n\n1 + 1.2D?\n+ 0.046(1 ? 0.57e?0.02D?), (2.16)\n\nfor 0.1 &lt;Re? &lt;10\n4, where Re? = u?D/?. This equation represents the\n\nmean threshold curve estimated by those authors. The lower and upper\nlimits shown in Figure 2.7 are:\n\nShc =\n0.165\n\n0.7 + 1.2D?\n+ 0.03(1 ? 0.57e?0.02D?), (2.17a)\n\nShc =\n0.380\n\n1.2 + 1.2D?\n+ 0.07(1 ? 0.57e?0.02D?), (2.17b)\n\nrespectively. These limits should be used to estimate the uncertainties of\nmeasurement.\n\n22\n\n\n\n2.2. Turbulent ?ow and sediment transport\n\nDepending on particle-?ow interaction, di?erent kind of transport modes\ncan appear. During their movement, particles will eventually fall back to\nbed with velocity vs which depends on ?ow dynamics and particles them-\nselves:\n\nv2s =\n?\n\n3\n\n(s? 1)gD\nCd\n\n, (2.18)\n\nwhere s = ?s/? and Cd is the drag coe?cient of the particle. Simpler and\nempirical relations have been studied for practical purpose such as the one\nreached by (Zhiyao et al., 2008) based on experiments from the literature:\n\nvs =\n?\n\nD\nD3?\n[\n38.1 + 0.93D12/7?\n\n]?7/8\n. (2.19)\n\nIf particles sedimentation velocity is much greater than friction velocity,\nparticles will be stuck in the bed, and will not be transported. If friction\nvelocity is greater enough to surpass the critical value, particles will stay in\ncontact with the bed, making small displacement, characterizing the bed-\nload transport. For greater shear stress applied to the bottom, particles\nwill be able to make higher jumps (saltation regime), and eventually being\nsuspended (suspended load) and carried away by ?ow (Bagnold, 1966) (Fig-\nure 2.8). The relation between sedimentation velocity and shear velocity\ncan be used to identify how transport will happen.\n\n?b\n\nvs\n\n?c\n\ny\n\nbedload\n\nsuspension\n\nwash load\n\nu(y)\n?, ?\n\nFigure 2.8: Schematic representation of open-channel ?ow in presence of a mobile\nbed.\n\nConsidering for example a poly-dispersed mobile bed, i.e. very broad\ngrain-size distribution. For vs/u? > 1, the sedimentation velocity is high\nenough so smaller sediments will move rolling, sliding or jumping in small\nhops. For vs/u? &lt;1, particles make long jumps, eventually falling back to\nthe bed, but travel more time along the ?ow, sometimes even reaching the\n?ow surface. This particle transport mechanism is called inhomogeneous\n\n23\n\n\n\n2. Physical and mathematical review\n\nsuspended load, presenting a concentration pro?le that decreases with ver-\ntical coordinate. For vs/u? small enough, the ?ow stress applied into the\nmobile bed is great enough to make small particles travel along the ?ow,\ncharacterizing the intrinsic suspended load or wash load and the concentra-\ntion pro?le becomes almost a constant. The Rouse number:\n\nRo =\nvs\n?u?\n\n, (2.20)\n\nsometimes is also used to relate the same behavior:\n\n\u2022 Ro > 2.5 - bedload transport;\n\n\u2022 1.5 &lt;Ro &lt;2.5 - up to 50% suspended load;\n\n\u2022 0.8 &lt;Ro &lt;1.2 - up to 100% suspended load;\n\n\u2022 Ro &lt;0.8 - intrinsic suspended load.\n\nSo, for a ?xed mono-dispersed grain-size distribution (particles with a\nGaussian distribution centered at a speci?c diameter D), the proportional-\nity between shear rate and Shield's number allow us to identify regions of\ntransport modes inside the regions (B) and (D) from Figure 2.2:\n\n\u2022 at low shear rate, bed load transport takes place. A thin sheet of\nparticles moves close to bed. Fluid keeps its original properties and\nsmall in?uence is perceived by ?ow. Flow capacity is usually limited\nto values smaller than packing concentration ?c and no ?uid variation\nis perceived along vertical coordinate.\n\n\u2022 For intermediate shear rates, suspended transport mode takes place.\nParticles concentration become better distributed along vertical coor-\ndinate. Quasi-Newtonian rheologies could be still employed on ?uid\nrepresentation as their presence might change ?uid viscosity.\n\n\u2022 at higher shear rates, sediments concentration can become more equally\ndistributed in y. Concentration might reach relatively high values,\nsometimes reaching minimum packing value ?c, and then changing\n?ow regime.\n\nParallel to the one presented on Figure 2.4, considering water-sediment\nmixture, Graf and Altinakar (2000) de?ne the type of sediment transport as\nfunction of the concentration of sediment particles, which can also change\n?ow dynamics, as shown on Table 2.1.\n\n24\n\n\n\n2.2.

Bed and suspended\nload are characterize by this level of concentration and are the most\nfrequent type of ?ow on water streams.\n\n\u2022 Flow mixtures will behave as quasi-Newtonian solutions if the con-\ncentration is still low, ?v &lt;8%. Concentrated suspended load and\nturbidity streams are characterize by concentrations of this magni-\ntude.\n\n\u2022 Finally, ?ow mixture will behave as non-Newtonian if ?v > 8%. Non-\nNewtonian ?uids have completely di?erent behavior from Newtonian\nones and change ?ow dynamics drastically, included friction. Parti-\ncles will rest suspended for long time and sedimentation velocity will\nbe in?uenced by the concentration. Sediments transport in hypercon-\ncentrated solutions characterize mud ?ows and also hyperconcentrated\nturbidity streams. It can be generate by a great discharge rate of ?ne\nsediments on a low steep water open-channel ?ow, which usually can\nbe seen on rainy season. Another possibility are the formation of tor-\nrential lavas on very steep channels, ? > 15?, that are composed by a\nvast domain of particles, from cohesive ?ne particles to large blocks\nof rock (? 1 m3), and are considerably fast.\n\nExperiments from Maciel et al.

In the up-right corner, sketch of the\n?ow con?guration with the frame of reference and a generic concentration pro?le\n(Berzi and Fraccarollo, 2013). The degree of saturation is the ratio between mean\n?ow height and maximum height of transported particles jumps. For such ratio\nequals to 1, particles trajectories cover all position in the ?ow height.\n\n2.3 Laminar ?ow and non-Newtonian ?uids\n\nMud?ows are often characterized as saturated ?ows, aqueous mixtures with\nhigh concentration of solid material. The variability found on solid-liquid\nfraction composing the mixture contribute to the complexity of the ?uid\nwhich could acquire cohesive or non-cohesive behavior, depending on the\nmaterial in suspension, specially for natural environments (Malet et al.,\n2003; Rema\u00eetre et al., 2005). For mixtures where sediment concentration\nis high and the energy dissipation is mainly viscous, the mixture behavior\ncan be characterized by an equivalent ?uid model, employing a rheological\nmodel, which sums up contributions of particles and ?uid interactions. The\n\n26\n\n\n\n2.3. Laminar ?ow and non-Newtonian ?uids\n\nmain feature of such models is the presence of a yield stress, thus pointing\nout non-Newtonian rheological behavior of ?uid.\n\nTo our knowledge, ?ows of complex ?uids are yet to be completely un-\nderstood by scienti?c community. Present in many branches of technologi-\ncal and scienti?c matters, the knowledge of such kind of ?ow, and even of\ncomplex ?uids, is clearly an open task that interest all community. From\ncomplex ?uids, one should understand ?uids that present a non-Newtonian\nrheology, where shear stress and shear ratio are not linearly proportional\nby a constant ?uid viscosity (\u00b5).\n\n(a) (b)\n\n(c) (d) (e)\n\nFigure 2.10: Examples of non-Newtonian ?uid ?ows in di?erent environments.\n2.10(a): mud dam-break event of Mariana district, Minas Gerais state, Brazil, 5th\nNovember 2015; 2.10(b): lahar ?ow from late November 1985 in R\u00edo Lagunillas,\nformer location of Armero, Colombia; 2.10(c): concrete been poured; 2.10(d):\ndrilling mud used in oil industry; 2.10(e): cornstarch mixture subdue to stress\nfrom speaker vibration.\n\n27\n\n\n\n2. Physical and mathematical review\n\nParticularly, Herschel-Bulkley ?uids show yield and also non-linearity\nbetween shear rate and shear stress. Polymer mixtures (gels), water mix-\ntures of solid particles (cement, mud), emulsions, sols and many others are\nclassical examples of such ?uids (Balmforth et al., 2014), as illustrates Fig-\nure 2.10. When dealing in simple shearing conditions, those ?uids can be\nrepresented by the following model,\n\n?xy = ?0 + Kn\n\n(\n?u\n\n?y\n\n)n\n, for ? > ?0, (2.21)\n\nwhere ?0 represents the yield (formally ?uid yield stress), Kn is called con-\nsistency index, and n is the power-law index for ?uid, which gives the non-\nlinearity between shear stress and shear ratio. When dealing with water-\nsolid mixtures in isothermal conditions, these three parameters depend ex-\nclusively on the sediment properties: concentration, geometry, density, etc\n(Mueller et al., 2009). From the mathematical perspective, such model is\nrather interesting since it can be used to represent less complex ?uids by\nsimple manipulation of parameters: for n = 1, Bingham ?uids are repre-\nsented; for ?0 = 0, power-law ?uids are ?t; for n = 1,?0 = 0, Newtonian\n?uids can also be represented. Even though research about modeling of\nyield stress still continues (Barnes, 1999; Rajagopal, 2006; Ovarlez et al.,\n2013), the model gives interesting insight and practical results about many\nkind of ?uids.\n\nFor such kind of ?uid, the Reynolds number have to be adapted to a\nmore generic form (Haldenwang et al., 2002; Burger et al., 2010, 2015) to\nbetter ?t the set of parameter used to de?ne the rheological properties of\nthe ?uid:\n\nRe =\n8?u20\n\n?0 + Kn(2u0/h0)n\n, (2.22)\n\nconsidering the steady and permanent case, which velocity and free surface\nheight are both constant values u0 and h0, respectively, as shows Figure 8.1.\n\nThe system of equations that govern the problem can be simpli?ed from\nEquations 2.2a and 2.2b, considering the geometry and the laminar ?ow\n\n28\n\n\n\n2.4.

(2.23c)\n\nAt this point it is also important to de?ne a dimensionless number that\nrelates yield stress with ?ow height, which gives the idea on how important\nis ?ow yield compared to the bottom shear stress:\n\nC? =\n?0\n\n?gh0 sin ?\n. (2.24)\n\nThis dimensionless number is analogous to the Bingham number (for\nnon-Newtonian ?uid ?ows in pressure driven ?ows). It is the ratio between\nthe ?uid yield and the driven force, represented by the shear stress.\n\n2.4 Free surface instabilities - Roll waves\n\nFree surface instabilities are phenomena that inspire researches on many\ndi?erent subjects related to open-channel ?ows. From breaking waves and\ntidal bores, to roll waves instabilities (Figure 2.12), the interest on such\nphenomena lies in the fact that their appearance change the steady and\npermanent con?guration of ?ow, sometimes a?ecting ?ow interaction with\n\n29\n\n\n\n2.

When consid-\nering that ?ow could assume temporal and spatial variations, the hyperbolic\nnature of governing equations give the particular physical problem that is\ncalled roll waves. For a given set of special conditions, shock gravitational\nwaves can be developed on the free surface of open-channel ?ows (Figures\n2.12(c) and 2.12(d)). The basic feature to understand their appearance is\nthe Froude number Fr, which relates ?ow and gravity waves velocities:\n\nFr =\nu0?\n\ngh0 cos ?\n(2.29)\n\n31\n\n\n\n2. Physical and mathematical review\n\nThe slope is the main factor that drives the behavior of such waves. From\nthe classical works from Vedernikov (1945); Chow (1959); Ponce (1991),\nroll waves might appear in every stage of mud?ows evolution, presenting\ndi?erent conditions, represented by the Froude number, summarized by\nTable 2.2. Nevertheless, another important factor on such instabilities gen-\neration is the channel length. They required a minimum length to develop,\nconsidering an in?nitesimal disturbance applied to permanent and uniform\n?ow (Montuori, 1961, 1963). Given a random source of disturbances, it must\nexist a minimum channel length necessary for roll waves to completely de-\nvelop. The amplitude and frequency of the disturbance are important to\nde?ne such length. Since the solution of roll waves problem can be obtained\nfrom a second-order ordinary di?erential equation, the eigenvalues give the\nstability points and roll waves solution are an attractor of periodic solution\nestablished around one of those points. This means that the closer the ini-\ntial condition (or disturbances) is to the periodic solution, the faster it will\nconverge to it (Hwang and Chang, 1987; Needham and Merkin, 1984). Ex-\nperimentally this have been observed by Fiorot (2012); Fiorot et al. (2015)\nfor laminar Newtonian ?ows.\n\nAlthough detailed observations on roll waves were ?rst presented in 1910\nby Cornish (1934), Je?reys (1925) was the ?rst to analyze the waves in\nclean water turbulent ?ows. The work determined the generation criterion\nfor the problem as a speci?c value of the Froude number Fr > 2; below\nthis value, roll waves cannot appear. This value was then further adapted\nby Vedernikov (1945) to di?erent channel con?gurations. Searching for\nmore quanti?ed data, Dressler's model (Dressler, 1949) tried to represent\nthe wave pro?le. His formulation was peculiar because the solution of his\nequation presented an intermediate value for the wave height, at which no\nsolution was possible. Applying the Rankine-Hugoniot shock condition, he\nwas able to remodel the equation and construct the wave pro?le based on\nthe monotonic solutions of the equation tied together by the shock point.\nDressler's model simplify previous Equations 2.25 and 2.26 since the turbu-\nlent dissipation of second order is not considered (?t = 0). Also, parameter\n? = 1 meaning fully turbulent pro?le, no sheared zone, and f (u,h) = u2/h:\n\n?h\n\n?t\n+\n?(hu)\n\n?x\n= 0; (2.30)\n\n?u\n\n?t\n+ u\n\n?u\n\n?x\n+ g\n\n?h\n\n?x\ncos ? = g sin ? ?Cf\n\nu2\n\nh\n.

Even though roll waves subject have been largely studied, inter-\nactions between roll waves and sediment transport are still not completely\n\n33\n\n\n\n2. Physical and mathematical review\n\nunderstood. Usually when solving two-phase problems, where we have ?ow\nand sediment transport, the solution can be reached through de-coupled\nsystems of equations. However, when in roll waves regime, an interac-\ntion between both phases seems to takes place and proper numerical so-\nlutions can only be obtained through if equations are coupled (Colombini\nand Stocchino, 2005). Wave of sediments were also observed experimentally\n(Davies, 1990; Armanini and Recchia, 2006), but no precise mechanism has\nbeen de?ned. On the other hand, recent research from Balmforth and Vakil\n(2012) shows that particular structures on the mobile bed called cyclic steps\ncan appear when in roll waves regime, but they usually end up stabilizing\nthe ?ow, thus working as a feedback to surface instabilities. Some simi-\nlar conclusions were found by Zhao et al. (2015) concerning the feedback of\nsolid particles concentration on ?ow to waves properties. For a channel with\n?xed geometry, those researchers observed that ?ow would not be prone to\nroll waves generation as soon as a threshold solid concentration of sediment\nwas reached. These examples prove that there are interaction e?ects be-\ntween ?ow dynamics in roll waves regime and sediments transported which\ncannot be simply addressed.\n\nFigure 2.14: From Richard and Gavrilyuk (2012).

Using the same idea as Dressler\n(1949) but now adding some complexity in ?uid rheology, Ng and Mei (1994)\nconstructed the permanent wave pro?le for laminar power-law ?uid ?ows\nas nonlinear waves connected by shocks. A linearized stability analysis\nshowed an update of Ishihara's generation criterion, where the dependence\nof the minimum Froude number with the ?ow index (n) is highlighted,\nFrmin = n/(2n + 1)\n\n1\n2 . When n = 1 (Newtonian ?uid), Ishihara's criterion is\n\nrecovered thus reassuring this method.\n\nFigure 2.15: From Ng and Mei (1994).

Physical and mathematical review\n\nmaterials such as water-clay mixtures. Through a large experimental ap-\nproach, Coussot (1994) proved that the Herschel-Bulkley rheological model\nbest ?ts the pro?le of this type of material because it uses three parameters\nto represent the ?uid behavior: yield stress (?0), ?ow index (n), and consis-\ntency index (Kn). The same conclusion was obtained by Maciel et al. (2009)\nfor Brazilian clay mixtures with water; the behavior of the mixture shows\nthe strong presence of a yield stress value. Coussot (1994) also performed\nlinear stability analysis and obtained a threshold value for Froude number\nthat depends on the ?uid rheological parameters; he was also able to qual-\nitatively evaluate that below that value, no instabilities were observed in\nhis experimental bench. The work of Maciel et al. (2013) extends the do-\nmain of validity of previous works (Ishihara et al., 1954; Ng and Mei, 1994),\ncorroborating the results found by Coussot (1994), using a more complex\nrheological model, the same as Coussot (1994), as presentes Figure 2.16.\nThe ?gure shows also how the non-Newtonian properties control the stabil-\nity domain, increasing possibility of roll waves appearance.\n\nNevertheless, other e?ects had to be also investigated to better approx-\nimate theoretical predictions to what is observed in a natural environment.\nThe e?ect of topography, as mentioned before; porosity of bed; bed scour;\nand so on.

In those ?ows, sediments like sand are usually\ntransported in bedload. Even though no unifying physical model is able to\ndescribe the movement of sediment particles in a ?uid ?ow, studies from the\nlast century (Einstein, 1950; Bagnold, 1977) are still used as valuable refer-\nences for recent works. Despite of the well-posed problem of measuring the\nsolid discharge and di?culties concerning the representativeness of physical\nphenomenon, scienti?c e?orts employed so far have led to a vast set of em-\npirical relations. The seemingly reasonable semi-empirical relations broadly\nused help the understanding on how sediment transport happens in terms\nof mean values during steady ?ow con?guration.\n\nHowever, can those empirical laws be directly applied on time-variable\nproblems (non-stationary phenomena) such as tidal bores, dam-break and\nsurface instabilities? In those cases, the level of stress applied to the bottom\nis not accurately known and should be di?erent depending on the ?ow itself,\nthus indicating a non-uniform transport. Taking for example the case for a\ndam-break, as shows Figure 3.1 from Fraccarollo and Capart (2002). Sim-\npli?ed empirical laws would not be capable to capture the shock wave e?ect\non the mobile bed, and even more the erosional bore formed by directly\napplying the formulas. They are transitory e?ects that should be solved in\ntime, thus rendering steady-like formula not easily applied. Another exam-\nple of such di?culty is given by Ancey et al. (2006), as illustrates Figure 3.2.\nWhen close to the imminence of transport, ?uctuations of ?ow could lead to\nintermittent transport, thus a non-zero net solid discharge, even though the\nmean bottom shear stress would not be able to produce sediment transport.\n\nMost of the time, the empirical relations employed for steady and uni-\n\n41\n\n\n\n3. Introduction\n\nFigure 3.1: Experimental images from Fraccarollo and Capart (2002) which shows\ndam-break event advancing over mobile bed. The strong non-linear event prop-\nerties subject a discontinuous pro?le of sediment transport.\n\nform ?ow aren't able to satisfactory represent how sediment dynamics would\nbe a?ected by non-stationary phenomena. One could guess that time-\ndependent e?ects such as horizontal accelerations, phase lags, and some-\ntimes even ?ow velocity ?uctuations should not be ?t to that approach.\nNevertheless, the same empirical relations can be sometimes adapted into\nnumerical solvers. Through discretization of conservation equations, time\nand spatial numerical solutions can be considered steady and uniform as-\nsumptions at time steps/discretization cells. The solution of solid and liq-\nuid phase are usually computed separately (Colombini and Stocchino, 2005;\nSiviglia et al., 2008) using Saint-Venant equations for the liquid phase and\nExner equation for the solid phase. Recently the coupling between both\n\n42\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Example of discontinuous transport and anomalous di?usion of mass\ndue to non-constant stress applied. Sediment transport can only happen if ?ow\napplies enough stress to overcome particle submerged weight, represented by a\nthreshold velocity uc. Turbulent ?uctuations can interfere with continuous state\nof transport when mean ?ow is close to particles threshold velocity.\n\nphases solution started to be explored (Audusse et al., 2012; Balmforth and\nVakil, 2012), pointing out that a strong interaction between ?ow and sedi-\nment are at stake in some cases.\n\nHydraulic instabilities represent a vast set of classical Engineering prob-\nlems where steady and uniform conditions can't be considered. Their pres-\nence might di?cult or mis-lead the computation of solid discharge. Re-\nsearchers from Oceanography have dealt with such problem on shore ero-\nsion and have been adapting the semi-empirical laws to their problems.\nResearcher usually modify the empirical functions of sediment transport to\nemploy wave friction, phase lag between waves and sediment transport and\nother features to better estimate solid discharge (van Rijn, 2007; Kranen-\nburg et al., 2013).\n\nAnother example of hydraulic instabilities are roll waves which are fast-\nmoving steep waves with ?xed wavelength and amplitude (See chapter 2).\nTheir in?uence on sediment transport rate is still not well understood\nbut have already been experimentally studied (Davies, 1990). On highly-\nconcentrated ?ows, Davies (1990) have perceived that such waves changed\nhow transport occurred, generating sediment waves and increasing mean\ndischarge (Figure 3.3(a)). Similar observations have also been made for\nlow-concentrated ?ows (Armanini and Recchia, 2006). Numerical simula-\ntions show that when these hydraulic instabilities appear, ?ow and sediment\n\n43\n\n\n\n3. Introduction\n\ndynamics can no longer be solved separately (Colombini and Stocchino,\n2005). Figure 3.3(b) shows the stability diagram for the coupled system\n(mobile bed-?ow), presenting the superposition of bed and ?ow instabilities\nfor low wavenumbers and high Froude. Even though total discharge seems\nto change by roll waves presence, neither experiments nor numerical sim-\nulations have reached any speci?c relation and/or value to quantify their\ne?ect. The logical conclusion is that there must exists a physical interaction\nbetween roll waves and transport sediment that is not taken into account.\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 3.3: Examples from scienti?c researches that indicate possibles e?ects\nbetween roll waves instabilities and sediment transport. 3.3(a): Picture from\nDavies (1990) illustrating how roll waves and sediment waves interact; 3.3(b):\nstability plot showing that anti-dunes instabilities from mobile bed can appear\ntogether with roll waves ?ow instability (Colombini and Stocchino, 2005).\n\nConsidering, for example, the open-channel ?ow represented on Fig-\nure 3.4 by the dark line: an incompressible Newtonian ?uid with density ?\nand kinematic viscosity ? ?ows down a channel, with width l0 and charac-\nteristic length L0, inclined of ?. The ?ow established is steady and uniform,\nwith characteristics as mentioned in section 2.2. In this case, turbulent\ndissipation is much greater than viscous one so that the last can be ne-\nglected, far from the walls. In the bottom of the channel lies a mobile bed\nof sediments with density ?s and mean diameter D. The capacity of ?ow to\ntransport sediment is related to the average stress applied to the bottom, ?b,\nor friction velocity u? (Equation 2.9), or Shields number (Equation 2.14).\n\n44\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Sketch of open-channel ?ow con?guration over mobile bed. Dark line\nrepresent free surface in steady and uniform conditions. Dashed line represent\nfree surface instabilities propagating downstream.\n\nCommon sediment transport formulas rely on steady and uniform ?ow\ninformations to estimate the mean value of solid discharge (Meyer-Peter\nand M\u00fcller, 1948; van Rijn, 1984; Wong and Parker, 2006). For bed-load,\nfor example, a representative way of expressing the relation between the\nsolid discharge, represented by q?, and Shields number is:\n\nq? ? A(Sh ? Shc)B, (3.1)\n\nwhere q? is the dimensionless solid discharge also known as Einstein bed-\nload parameter q? = qs/(?s\n\n?\n(s? 1)gD3) with qs being the bedload solid\n\ndischarge in weight per unit width per second; and A and B are constants\ncalibrated on ?ow and mobile bed properties (8 and 3/2 for Meyer-Peter\nand M\u00fcller (1948) and 4.93 and 8/5 for Wong and Parker (2006), respec-\ntively).\n\nNevertheless, it is di?cult to apply Equation 3.1 when non-stationary\n?ow properties are important. For example, given a ?ow with constant\ndischarge q, consider the two following situations: an observer ?xed in a\nposition (x0,y0) inside the ?ow so that 0 &lt;y0 ? h0; an observer ?xed\nat the free surface (x0,h0) when surface instabilities are present (dashed\nline in Figure 3.4). For the ?rst case, depending on the ?uctuations scales\nfrom turbulence, a certain degree of friction velocity variation would be\nperceived; for the second one, free surface would culminate in the variation\nof mean ?ow characteristics. In both conditions, ?ow parameters vary with\ntime, implying that bottom shear stress and friction velocity also vary (?b(t),\nu?(t), respectively). A ?rst approach that can be done to deal with such\nproblem can be performed by simply inserting a time dependent friction\nvelocity u?(t) (Nielsen and Callaghan, 2003; van der A et al., 2013) into\n\n45\n\n\n\n3. Introduction\n\nEquation 2.14. The classical formulas represented by Equation 3.1 should\nnow read:\n\nq?(t) ? A(Sh(t) ? Shc)B, (3.2)\n\nwhere both solid discharge and Shields number are time-dependent.\n\nThe discharge q?(t) is estimated by a nonlinear function to Sh(t) (thresh-\nold value Shc and with B 6= 1). Small variation on q?(t) are noticed when\nSh(t)/Shc ? 1 what implies that it might be di?cult to identify variations\non mean sediment discharge through classical formulae and common mea-\nsurement systems (gravimetric, p.e.). On the other hand, for Sh(t)/Shc ? 1,\na strong nonlinear e?ect is at stake and sediments can be taken from its\ninertial non-movement state to movement with an in?nitesimal increment\nof Sh(t) (Ancey et al., 2008). This e?ect would be averaged over time\nthrough commonly used measurement systems, thus changing the expected\nmean value (to respect mean ?ow properties) and con?rming the di?culty\nin measuring such interaction (Recking et al., 2009; Ancey et al., 2006). Ex-\nperimental investigation from Recking et al. (2009), for example, show that\nwhen Sh/Shc &lt;2.5 sediment transport shows high variations with time,\npresenting peak values of solid discharge which are much higher than the\nmean value. Once again the problem is to measure those variations of bot-\ntom shear stress, specially for low Shields number and runo? ?ows where\nthe desired precision for stress measure would be in order of 10?2 Pascals\n(Amir et al., 2014). To the best of our knowledge, this measurements have\nnot yet been performed/disclosed.\n\nTo make such kind of study further possible, two main actions should be\nundertaken: identify ?uctuations of bottom shear stress and/or friction ve-\nlocity; and identify ?uctuations of solid discharge. Despite great e?orts that\nhave been undertaken by the scienti?c community, it seems that there is no\nsystematic evidence from measurements that prove strong relation between\ntime-variable bottom shear stress and solid discharge. Works that follow\nKuhnle and Southard (1988) approach, for example, try to study the source\nof time variability found in the discharge signal, but since the time-scale\nis considerable high (? minute), relating those phenomena to turbulence\n(that have also much smaller time scales) might be biased. More recently,\nimage analysis have often been used to explore time features from ?ows and\n?uctuations on bed load discharge, as it has been explored by Frey et al.\n(2003). Those authors found that poly-dispersed sediments show greater\n?uctuations, which were not observed for mono-dispersed materials.\n\n46\n\n\n\nBased on the problem exposed, the aim of this work was to present a\nset of experimental methods that could allow measurement of both ?ow\ndynamic features and solid discharge over time when sediments are trans-\nported close to bed (bed load and saltation regime) for low and moderate\nShields number.\n\nTo study ?ow dynamics, a Particle Image Velocimetry system (PIV) was\nemployed and a special relation was constructed to obtain friction velocity\nover time (Ould Ahmedou et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2009; Radice et al.,\n2009). For the sediment transport, a horizontal sand trap was employed,\nbased on experiments from Ho et al. (2012); Guignier (2014). The method-\nology here presented could then be used to better understand origins of\nsolid discharge ?uctuations.\n\nOn chapter 4 the experimental set-up developed is detailed as well as the\nmeasurement systems employed to characterize ?ow dynamics and sediment\ndischarge. Section 4.2 brings a critical analysis of measurements and meth-\nods employed which allowed the validation of results presented. chapter 5\nthe results from a set of time-dependent sediment transport experiments\nwere explored using three main analysis: mean value of solid discharge;\nspectral analysis of the signal; ?uctuations intensities of solid transport.\nThe same chapter presents results for solid discharge experimental runs\nwhen disturbances were applied to the ?ow.\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4\n\nExperimental method\n\n4.1 Materials and methods\n\n4.1.1 Experimental ?ume\n\nA small Plexiglas ?ume (0.2 m wide - l0, 2.0 m long) was installed over a\ntilting desk (Figure 4.1). Water ?ow was employed in a closed system using\na constant level reservoir to control discharge (Q = 0.4 l/s maximum).\nInlet ?ow was subdue to a set of nylon grids where undesired large-scale\nturbulent structures were signi?cantly reduced. In order to impose ?xed\nturbulent properties to the ?ow, cylindrical obstacles (10 mm in diameter,\n2 cm long) were placed after the grids. Downstream the inlet section, ?ow\npassed through several parts (Figure 4.1): a ?xed bed of 1.35 meter long\nwith test sediment attached; a test zone, where ?ow measurements were\ncollected in the ?nal 2 cm of the ?xed bed; a mobile bed of Lb = 0.38 meter\nlong ?lled with glass beads evenly spread (porosity p = 0.39); a horizontal\nsand trap 0.30 meter long (Lt) where sediment discharge was recorded; and\nthe outlet section.\n\n4.1.2 Flow measurements\n\nTwo measurement system were installed in the test zone: A graduated\ncontact needle (CN) and a Particle Image Velocimetry system (PIV). The\ncontact needle was used to measure mean free surface height at di?erent\npoints of the channel to check for the steady and uniform regime of ?ow.\nMean ?ow height measured h0CN indicated the mean ?ow dynamics, thus\nmeasurements derived from this method are called global measurements.\nMeasures from PIV system came from a 2D plane positioned in the center\n\n49\n\n\n\n4.

Materials and methods\n\n\u2022 measure of ?ow discharge Q - through a bucket, precision balance and\na chronometer;\n\n\u2022 mean ?ow height through contact needle h0CN;\n\nThe ?ow discharge was constant and then known, with precision eQ\nat \u00b11 ? 3%. Mean ?ow height measurements showed precision ?h0 =\n\u00b10.25mm. These two values combined give the mean ?ow velocity u0CN:\n\nu0CN =\nQ\n\nl0h0CN\n, (4.1)\n\nwith precision eu0 = \u00b11 ? 7%.\nFor a steady and uniform ?ow, in shallow water conditions, pressure is\n\nhydrostatic. Then, the bottom shear stress reads:\n\n?b = ?gh0CN sin ?, (4.2)\n\nand ?nally the friction velocity can be found using Equation 2.9. The pre-\ncision of u? depends on the slope and mean ?ow height precision and varies\nbetween eu?CN = \u00b11?20%. Global measures were further used to calculate\nthe dimensionless numbers that characterize the ?ow: Reynolds (Equa-\ntion 2.6), Shields (Equation 2.14) and Froude (Equation 2.29) numbers,\npreviously de?ned.\n\nLocal measurements - Particle Image Velocimetry system (PIV)\n\nThe PIV measurement gave information of ?ow velocity ?eld through an\nintense double-pulsed laser sheet and a high-speed camera. Such equipment\nproduced a pair of images that was then used to calculate the displacement\nof packs of seeding particles dispersed in the ?ow for sub-zones inside the\nimage, called regions of interest (ROI). The calculated displacement was\nthen used to calculate the velocity based on the time between each laser\npulse (Time Between Pulses - TBP). The velocity of particles was then as-\nsumed equal to ?ow velocity (Figure 4.3).\n\nTaking into account the global aspect ratio of the ?ow, PIV measure-\nments employed a rectangular ROI (64 x 16 or 128 x 32 pixels, depending on\nseeding quality). The e?ective area of measurement was 1664 x 1280 pixels,\ncorresponding to 11.12 mm x 9.03 mm. The open-channel ?ow was seeded\nwith silver-coated hollow glass spheres with a diameter around 10 \u00b5m. The\nparticles were illuminated by the thin laser sheet created by a single-head\nLaserglow laser coupled to a cylindrical lens. The laser was operated at a\n\n51\n\n\n\n4. Experimental method\n\nFigure 4.3: Principle of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique functioning.\nA double-pulsed laser sheet crosses a ROI of the ?ow, which then is recorded\nthrough high-speed camera. The pair of image is used to calculate the displace-\nment of seeding particles in the ?ow, and respective velocity. Their velocity is\nassumed equals to ?ow velocity. (DANTEC Dynamics)\n\nwavelength of 532 nm and double-pulsed at 7 Hz, with each pulse delivering\napproximately 5-15 mJ of energy, su?cient enough to illuminate the seeding\nparticles. The scattered laser light from seeding particles was recorded with\na 2048 x 2048 pixel CCD camera from Dantec Dynamics, during 100-300\n\u00b5s of exposure time, depending on estimated mean ?ow velocity. The time\nseparation between the laser pulses (TBP) was also adjusted according to\nglobal mean ?ow velocity u0CN.\n\nCross correlation was then ?rstly applied to images (Keane and Adrian,\n1993) by software DynamicStudio (Dantec Dynamics A/S). Secondly, peak\nand range validation of vectors were employed. The minimal signal/noise\nratio used was 1.2. Range validation of vector were based on estimative of\nmean ?ow velocity u0CN. Then, for longitudinal velocities, the range ac-\ncepted varied from ?0.20u0CN to 1.75u0CN and for vertical velocities from\n?0.50u0CN to 0.50u0CN. To avoid statistical bias, only valid vectors were\nused for ?ow velocity ?eld (u,v), with u = u(x,y,t) the longitudinal com-\nponent and v = v(x,y,t) the vertical velocity component. For each run, we\n\n52\n\n\n\n4.1. Materials and methods\n\nacquired at least 1000 images, and the total amount of valid vectors used for\neach position in y was approximately 3000. Precision of PIV measurements\nePIV was calculated based on equipment characteristics, as suggests (Lazar\net al., 2010). For our equipment and mounting, ePIV = 4.5%.\n\nSince the ?ow produced was preferentially in the longitudinal direction\nx, the velocity pro?le that should have established depended mainly on\nvertical coordinate y. Each velocity component (u,v) was separated in\nmean and ?uctuating components through data processing in Matlab:\n\nu(x,y,t) = u?(x,y) + u?(x,y,t); (4.3)\n\nv(x,y,t) = v?(x,y) + v?(x,y,t); (4.4)\n\nu?(x,y) =\n1\n\nNt\n\n?\nt\n\nu(x,y,t); (4.5)\n\nu?(x,y,t) = u(x,y,t) ? u?(x,y); (4.6)\n\nwhere Nt is the number of valid vector from initial to ?nal time step. Af-\nterwards, the average pro?le of mean ?ow velocity ?u??(y) was calculated\naveraging through longitudinal coordinate x:\n\n?u??(y) =\n1\n\nNx\n\n?\nx\n\nu?(x,y), (4.7)\n\nwith Nx is the number of valid vector on the calculated zone along x. Ve-\nlocity ?eld standard deviation uRMS(x,y) was calculated as:\n\nuRMS(x,y) =\n\n?\n1\n\nNt\n\n?\nt\n\nu?2(x,y,t), (4.8)\n\nwhich can then be also used to calculate the average pro?le for standard\ndeviation of velocity ?eld:\n\n?uRMS?(y) =\n1\n\nNx\n\n?\nx\n\nuRMS(x,y). (4.9)\n\nThe same procedure was applied to vertical component of velocity. Mean\n?ow height and velocity can be estimated based on velocity pro?le through\nintegration of ?u??(y) and ?ow discharge (Equation 2.1), thus giving h0PIV\n\n53\n\n\n\n4. Experimental method\n\nand u0PIV.\n\nThe ?ow average velocity ?u??(y) was transformed in wall coordinates\n(Equations 2.11b and 2.11a) using the global value for friction velocity\nu?CN. Then, the pro?le was ?tted to the universal solution for turbu-\nlent ?ows (Equation 2.13) and the value for the friction velocity u?PIV was\nre?ned. Quality of ?uctuation ?eld was veri?ed by turbulent intensities\nu+RMS(y) = ?uRMS?(y)/u?PIV and v\n\n+\nRMS(y) = ?vRMS?(y)/u?PIV, compared to\n\nexperimental results from the literature.\n\nSince the proposal of this work was to study sediment transport over\ntime, friction velocity also needed to be determined as function of time.\nA method derived from Ould Ahmedou et al. (2007) was here adopted\nwhich consisted in founding a relationship between the ?ow velocity at\nsome point and mean friction velocity. Ould Ahmedou et al. (2007) work\nproves that, for eolian sediment transport, the discharge is correlated with\nthe instantaneous velocity in an arbitrary position close to the bed. In this\nway, based on ?u??(y), a vertical coordinate y0 was chosen and values from\nthe velocity ?eld ?u?(y0, t) were correlated to the average friction velocity\nu?PIV. This methodology is further evaluated on section 4.2.\n\n4.1.3 Sediment transport measurement\n\nTest-sediment used during experimental tests were glass beads with mean\ndiameter D50 = 200\u00b5m (dispersion between 150 and 250 \u00b5m) and density\n?s of 2430 kg/m\n\n3. These particles have terminal fall velocity vs ? 0.02\nms?1. Figure 4.4 shows results from particles grain size distribution made\nthrough laser di?raction method on two samples: brand new particles; and\nused particles. Histograms show that no substantial di?erence is noticed\non particles distribution size. Critical value for Shields (Shc) calculated\nthrough empirical values from the literature (Paphitis, 2001) points out a\nvalue of 0.062 (u?c = 0.013 m/s) and lower and upper limits equal to 0.057\nand 0.088 (-9%; +40%) respectively.\n\nFor the sediment discharge measurement, two measurement system were\nalso employed: a ?ltering fabric positioned at channel output; and the hor-\nizontal trap (Figure 4.5). The horizontal trap was designed based on wind\ntunnel experiments from Ho et al. (2012) and internal water ?ow from Guig-\nnier (2014) where such kind of trap was used to study sediment transport in\nsaltation regime. This method is quite interesting because it evaluates not\nonly sediment discharge but also their scattering in space allowing di?er-\n\n54\n\n\n\n4.1.

This method was here adapted and allowed\nbasically the same informations to be acquired with an extra temporal de-\nscription.\n\nFigure 4.5: Schematic representation of horizontal trap section. For sake of visu-\nalization, illustration represent a longitudinal cut following the trap.\n\nGlobal measurements - Total mass weighting (W)\n\nThe global measurement of solid discharge consisted on weighing the sed-\niment mass transported during the experimental run. From the ?lter in-\nstalled at channel outlet, particles transported and not trapped were col-\nlected. Adding the trapped mass to such value, the global mean discharge\n\n55\n\n\n\n4. Experimental method\n\nQ?sW was estimated dividing the mass by the total time of the experimental\nrun.\n\n4.1.4 Local measurements - Particle Tracking Velocimetry System\n(PTV)\n\nThe horizontal trap had a small width (4.1(b), lt = 3.9 mm), which rep-\nresented part of the total solid discharge. In this way, measurements from\nthe trap were local. Particles not trapped were transported downstream\nwhere the ?ltering fabric was installed allowing to capture all transported\nparticles. Particles move over mobile bed by rolling, sliding or saltating,\nwith trajectories that depend on the transport mode (as explained in chap-\nter 2. Minimum sand trap length was designed based on particles longest\ndisplacement along x, i.e. the deposition length Ldep, which is related to\nparticles highest jumps during their entrainment. In the general case, par-\nticles maximum height is proportional to the mean free surface. So,\n\nLdep ?\nu0\nvs\nh0. (4.10)\n\nHowever, for bed load transport, particles vertical movement scales with\nparticles diameter D (Fourri\u00e8re et al., 2010) which leads to the following\nrelation:\n\nLdep ?\nu0\nvs\nD. (4.11)\n\nConsidering a mean ?ow velocity u0 = 0.2 ms\n?1, the maximum deposition\n\nlength is roughly 2 mm, meaning that no drawback should be noticed by\nthe measurements performed in the trap (Lt = 0.30 ? Ldep = 0.002 m).\n\nParticles entrained by ?ow reached the trap, fell through the honey-\ncomb and arrived in the visualization chamber. They were illuminated by\na di?used light source positioned in the opposite side of the camera. Shad-\nows from particles were recorded with a 2048 x 2048 pixel CCD high-speed\ncamera sampling at 100 frames per second, which gave a time between\neach frame of ?t = 10 ms. Exposure time was settled at 1 ms. Raw im-\nages were recorded in grayscale as shown on Figure 4.6. Images were then\nprocessed through a Particle Tracking Velocimetry program developed in\nMatlab (PTV) to compute solid discharge.\n\nImages obtained at the counting chamber were processed with Matlab\nimage processing toolbox. The method here employed was similar to the\n\n56\n\n\n\n4.1. Materials and methods\n\nFigure 4.6: Raw image of horizontal trap from high-speed camera.\n\none used by Frey et al. (2003). Original images were cropped into an image\nI0 to eliminate undesired features from experimental set-up. Since di?erent\nexperimental runs can have di?erent light properties, images were enhanced\nto standardize images contrast and optimize particle detection algorithm.\nTo do so, a linear adjust of contrast was performed using the background\nimage B (when no shadows of particles are present) as:\n\nI1 = I0 ?B, (4.12)\n\nI2 =\n255\n\nmax(I1) ? min(I1)\n(I1 ? min(I1)). (4.13)\n\nAfter image enhancing, images were transformed into binary using Canny\nedge detection ?lter (Canny, 1986). For the threshold required in the edge\n?lter, Otsu's threshold method (Otsu, 1979) was applied following indica-\ntion of Fang et al. (2009). Morphological operations were performed on the\nbinary image. Firstly, the operation of closing was performed using a struc-\ntural binary element that allow optimal closing of particles shadow edges.\nThose edges were then ?lled and consecutive operations of erosion and di-\nlatation were performed to eliminate spurious objects and dust particles.\nExamples of raw, enhance and binary image are shown in Figure 4.7.\n\nFor each image k taken from the experimental run, each particle pki was\nidenti?ed by means of their position vector ~rki and their diameter D\n\nk\ni . Based\n\non particle displacement vector ?~rki = ~r\nk\ni ?~r\n\nk?1\ni (Figure 4.8) during a step\n\ntime ?t, their individual velocity ~vki was calculated as\n\n(uki ,v\nk\ni ) =\n\n?~rki\n?t\n\n.

(4.15)\n\nDi?erent methods can be employed to calculate the particles discharge\nand each one of them is somehow related to the other (Heyman, 2014). Two\ndi?erent methods based on particles velocity can be de?ned: one based on\naverage fall velocity; and another based on individual particle velocity. In\nthis work, only the second one was used due to grain-size distribution.\n\n58\n\n\n\n4.1. Materials and methods\n\nFigure 4.8: Scheme of particle counting inside the ROI. Open circle denotes\nparticles in time step tk?1 and black circle denotes particles ?t seconds after,\ntime step tk = tk?1 + ?t.\n\nMean particles velocity\n\nThe basic methodology that can be developed assumes that particles are\nfalling inside the counting chamber at the same constant speed vks for each\nimage. The total mass per image M(tk) is given by:\n\nM(tk) =\n\nNp?\ni\n\nmki , (4.16)\n\nwhere Np is the total amount of particle on image in time tk. The discharge\nis then given by:\n\nQs(t\nk) =\n\n1\n\n?tkesc\nM(tk), (4.17)\n\nwhere ?tkesc represents the mean time taken by such mass to vertically travel\nthe ROI, which we called particles escape time:\n\n?tkesc = ?yROI/v?\nk\ns , (4.18)\n\nwhere v?ks is the mean particles fall velocity:\n\nv?ks =\n1\n\nNp\n\nNp?\ni\n\nvksi. (4.19)\n\nThen, the discharge is:\n\nQs(t\nk) =\n\n1\n\n?yROI\nM(tk)v?ks . (4.20)\n\nThe uncertainties of measures can then be calculated as:\n\neqs =\n?\nemp\n\n2 + evs\n2 + e?yROI\n\n2 (4.21)\n\n59\n\n\n\n4. Experimental method\n\nWeighted-mean particles velocity\n\nSince particles falling velocity depend on the particle mass (proportional\nto particle diameter, Equation 2.18), a more precise computation of solid\ndischarge can be performed using a weighted-mean velocity as:\n\nv?s =\n1\n\nM(tk)\n\nNp?\ni\n\nmki v\nk\nsi\n\n(4.22)\n\nand then the discharge would be\n\nQs(t\nk) =\n\n1\n\n?yROI\nM(tk)v?kss =\n\nM(tk)\n\n?yROIM(tk)\n\nNp?\ni\n\nmki v\nk\nsi\n, (4.23)\n\nQs(t\nk) =\n\n1\n\n?yROI\n\nNp?\ni\n\nmki v\nk\nsi\n. (4.24)\n\nThis second method was adopted as the main source of results. The\nanalysis that will be shown on the next section employed this method with\na critical analysis of the results.\n\n4.1.5 Wave generator\n\nFlowfw\nnylon\n\ngrid\n\nAw\n\nDw\n\nFigure 4.9: Schematics of the side view from the upstream part of the channel\nwhere the disturbance system is positioned.\n\nUpstream the ?xed bed, between the nylon grids and cylindrical obsta-\ncles, a wave generator system was positioned used to disturb the free surface\nof the ?ow at a constant frequency. A detailed side view of the system is\nshown on Figure 4.9. An electronic function generator was coupled to a\npower ampli?er which then excited a solenoid. This solenoid was assembled\nto a rod with diameter Dw that disturbed the free surface of the ?ow at the\nselected frequency fw. The rod enters and exits the ?ow at a certain depth\n\n60\n\n\n\n4.2. Critical analysis of measurements\n\nAw, kept constant for every experimental run. The disturbance frequency\nwas controlled so it was not a multiple of others acquisition systems fre-\nquency.

(4.25)\n\n4.2 Critical analysis of measurements\n\n4.2.1 Sediment transport test\n\nTo evaluate the PTV methodologies described in subsection 4.1.4, a set\nof binary images was constructed, where the size of ?particles? and their\nvelocities were imposed. In those images, as exempli?es Figure 4.10, only\ntwo dimensions are considered, so the volume of particles is equal to their\nsurface. For sake of simplicity, for the tests that will follow density is taken\nas ?s = 1 (mass = volume).\n\nFigure 4.10: Arti?cial image created to test PTV methodology for solid discharge\ncalculation.\n\nIn?uence of ?yROI\n\nThe transformation of discrete sediment discharge to continuous domain\nwould required in?nitesimal scales of time step ?t and ROI. Such trans-\nformation is limited by sediment itself (discrete particles with ?nite size).\n\n61\n\n\n\n4. Experimental method\n\nTo determine the e?ect of ?yROI, a numerical analysis was conducted to\nsee how transport rate would change as this parameter grows as function\nof particles mean displacement length vs?t.\n\nTo evaluate how ?yROI a?ected the results, time series of constant im-\nages were constructed, each series presenting a di?erent size image with the\nsame pattern of particles. Figure 4.11 shows one example of such series at\nintervals of one second (?t = 1 s). Particles had the same size (12 pixels)\nand velocity (20 pixels/s). The sequence looks like a freeze video, but in\nfact particles velocity are constant, and their trajectory are vertical and\nstraight. The discharge can then be intuitively calculated as 2 particles per\nsecond enter the ROI, then q = 24 pixels/s.\n\n(a) tk. (b) tk+1 = tk + ?t. (c) tk+2 = tk + 2?t.\n\nFigure 4.11: Arti?cial sequence type A created to test PTV methodology depen-\ndence on ROI size.\n\nMaking the ?ROI vary for a well-behaved event, it can be observed that\nthere is a minimal ROI necessary for computed discharge to be equal to the\ncorrect value1. We de?ned then a minimum size for images equal to three\ntimes the mean displacement of sediment particles (?yROI > 3vs?t) given\nthe time between each image acquired ?t. Using data from an experimental\nruns (gb1-3), the same behavior was detected, although ?uctuations were\nperceived using the method explained in subsection 4.1.4, thus increasing\nthe minimum size of the images (?yROI > 10vs?t). The results are shown\non Figure 4.12.\n\nAs the ROI size increased, more particles could be counted and the\ne?ect that was perceived was a smoother signal of solid transport, as can\nbe observed in Figure 4.13. In this work we chose ?yROI ? 12vs?t.\n\n4.2.2 Grain-size distribution through images\n\nQuality of geometric properties from particles detected through image tech-\nnique can be evaluated comparing results to the typical grain-size distribu-\ntion for test-sand.

For small discharges and\nslopes, ?ow takes time to reach uniform and permanent con?gura-\ntion thus leading to an usually short time where no considerable solid\ntransport happens.\n\nII Dam-break transport (?rst surge of sediments). This stages corre-\nsponds to the abrupt change in friction induced by the release of the\ndam. Depending on the ?ow discharge and channel slope, this wave\ncan be considerably important, as shows Figure 4.16.\n\nIII Steady transport - qIIIs . Usually, after the ?rst wave, the sediment\ntransport can be assumed \"steady\". During this part of the signal,\nwe consider that the mobile bed is ?at. In this way, the bottom shear\nstress should be approximately the same to the one found at the ?xed\nbed. Mean and ?uctuated values can be calculated at this point. The\ntime duration of this part can vary depending on the Shields number.\nFor high Shields, this part should be smaller in time, and sometimes\ncannot be identi?ed.\n\n65\n\n\n\n4. Experimental method\n\nIV Non-stationary transport (bedform) - qIVs . Flow condition dictate\nwhether bedforms should appear in the mobile bed and how fast they\nwill travel. This will lead dunes and ripples to fall inside the trap,\ndrastically changing the solid discharge measured. For low and mod-\nerate Shields number, this stage can be identi?ed after the part III,\nwhen bedforms start to reach the trap. For high Shields number, the\nseparation between the parts III and IV is not clear, and then only\nthe part IV is considered after part II.\n\nAs it is, the ?rst stage could be detected by simple observation of the\ngiven solid discharge signal. The other three stages could be found quali-\ntatively but using a cumulative value for the mean transport can improve\nthe judgment:\n\nqsc(t) =\n1\n\nNt\n\nNt?\ni=1\n\nqs(t). (4.26)\n\nThe section was done choosing two time stamps and observing the be-\nhavior of two cumulative mean values: one starting from the initial time\n(positive direction of time); and another from the end time (negative di-\nrection of time). The uncertainty of the equipment was plotted as a shade\nzone around qsc. If both signals qsc cross, this means that initial and end\ntime stamp chosen select a qIIIs zone of solid transport.

Finally, as time stamps were\nfound, signal was broken apart in the stages mentioned before, as presents\nFigure 4.16.\n\n4.2.4 Measurements of mean solid discharge\n\nTo inspect the quality of solid discharge measurement, we compared the\nlocal and global values (from gravimetric and PTV methods), as presented\nin Figure 4.19. Such relation however depends on the quantity of sediment\nin the ROI.\n\n67\n\n\n\n4.

The\ndashed line represent the solid discharge limit value where particles quantity can\nstart to a?ect the solid discharge assertiveness. The solid line indicate the relation\nbetween both measured solid discharges under the limit of assertiveness.\n\nTo properly explore such information, the limitations of the system (Fig-\nure 4.20) must be understood:\n\nA - whenever particles fall side by side, only one shadow is perceived on\nimages. This lack of information leads to a reduced discharge rate by\ncounting less particles, thus smaller mass, and smaller ?ux;\n\nB - when particles numbers are high, one particle might come across the\npath of another. This might lead to the computation of a smaller\nparticle velocity, thus a smaller ?ux.\n\nTo estimate the number of particles in the image where the e?ects A and\nB can a?ect the measurement, we calculated particles mean displacement,\n\n??r = v?s?t, (4.27)\n\n68\n\n\n\n4.2.

Considering an organized distribution of particles in\nthe ROI, the limit number of particles in the image should be:\n\nNplim =\n?xROIsb ?yROI\n\n(vs?t)2\n. (4.28)\n\nThe limit discharge Qslim is proportional to that number:\n\nQslim =\nNplimm?pv?s\n\n?yROI\n.

This value is indicated in Figure 4.19 by the vertical dotted line.\nFinally, ?tting a curve for the solid discharges smaller than qslim, we ob-\ntained the function:\n\nqsP T V = 1.576qsW , (4.30)\n\nwith correlation coe?cient R2 = 0.94. To correct the mean value for time-\ndependent discharges beyond the limit qslim, one can simply use:\n\nq(t)corrected = 1.576\n\n(\nqsW\nqsP T V\n\n)\nq(t). (4.31)\n\nThis simple methodology allows the correction of mean value, but do\nnot assure proper ?uctuation of solid discharge.\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5\n\nMeasurements of unsteady sediment\n\ntransport\n\n5.1 Flow hydraulics of steady conditions\n\nExperimental runs were set by the ?ow discharge Q and the slope ? (see\ntable 5.1). For each run (Q; ?) two sets of data were collected from ?ow\nproperties: one through contact needle method and another through PIV\nmeasurements. Results shown on table 5.1 point out discrepancy between\nfriction velocity calculated by each method. For each run, sediment trans-\nport was measured.\n\n5.1.1 Base ?ow\n\nEach set of measurements was individually studied to evaluate its accu-\nracy and relevancy to our goals. To ?nd the set of data that would bet-\nter represent ?ow dynamics, an experimental inspection of critical Shields\nnumber Shc was performed. Firstly, ?ow discharge and channel slope were\n?xed with low Shields number to assure that no sediment transport was\nobserved; slope was then gradually increased until su?cient movement of\ngrains was detected in the counting chamber. These investigation proved\nthat u?CN was in agreement with u?c calculated through Paphitis (2001)\nsemi-empirical relation. So, despite greater uncertainties, measurement of\nmean ?ow properties based on contact needle method better represent the\n?ow global dynamics, so that:\n\nh0 = h0CN; (5.1)\n\nu0 = u0CN.

A linear correlation\nwas established between both methods of friction velocity measurement (lo-\ncal and global) (Figure 5.1), which allowed to correct u?PIV and to use it\nto estimate ?uctuations of u? as shows.\n\nFigure 5.1: Correlation between friction velocity computed through both methods\nu?CN and u?PIV.

So, only longitudinal component u?(x,y) was considered in this\nstudy. However, inspection of ?uctuating ?eld consider both components\nde?ned by Reynolds separation (Equations 4.5 and 4.6). Pro?les for ?u??(y)\nand ?uRMS?(y) are plotted on Figure 5.3 and show expected behavior for\nturbulent ?ow pro?les. For all tests, we remark that maximum value of\n?uRMS?(y) is achieved close to bed below 1 mm in accordance with the\nturbulent production by friction.\n\n?5 0 5 10 15\n\nx 10\n?3\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nVelocity (ms\n?1\n\n)\n\ny\n (\n\nm\nm\n\n)\n\nv (y)\n\ne\nPIV\n\nFigure 5.2: Averaged vertical velocity pro?le ?v??(y) compared to PIV system\nprecision ePIV for experimental run gb5.\n\nThrough inner coordinates transformation, it is possible to obtain re-\n?ned friction velocity and re?ned vertical position to ?t the experimental\nvelocity pro?le with the universal pro?le (Schlichting, 1979) (Equation 2.13)\nas shows Figure 5.4. However, inside the viscous sublayer, precise results\nfrom our experiments could not be achieved for distances smaller than sed-\niment particle diameter.\n\nSince experimental runs have moderate Reynolds number (2000 &lt;Re&lt;\n6000), the pro?les could be a?ected by modi?cations on channel relative\nroughness (ratio between sediments ?xed to the bed and mean ?ow height)\nand presence of wakes (Bergstrom et al., 2001; Bigillon et al., 2006; Agelin-\nchaab and Tachie, 2008).

Such results allowed us to speculate that even though full\nagreement was not achieved, the precision on the obtained velocity ?elds is\nsu?cient to measure the ?uctuations of the velocity due to the turbulent\nvortices, as shows Figure 5.6. It is very likely that the lack of accuracy on\nvertical velocities is due to the aspect ratio of the ROI.\n\n5.1.3 Friction velocity\n\nBased on the methodology explained on section 4.1.2, the position y0 was\nchosen slightly above where the maximum value for ?uRMS? is found, far\n\n76\n\n\n\n5.1.

Obvi-\nously this simple linear relation would not represent some of the complex-\nity taking place in the boundary layer, specially for ?ows with low kinetic\nenergy, where this relation should not stand (since function F isn't zero\ncrossing.).\n\nHaving a friction velocity that depended on time, we then explored the\npower spectral density (PSD) (Oppenheim and Schafer, 2009) of the signal\nu?(t) to identify its frequency content\n\n2. The PSD is a mathematical tool\nthat helps to identify the distribution of energy in the time-scales present\nin a discrete signal. For turbulent ?ows, this energy distribution follows a\ncascade of energy from the larger scale vortices (low frequencies) to small\nvortices (high frequencies), until reach the molecular scale, where dissipa-\ntion by viscosity occurs. Applying a dimensional analysis (Chassaing, 2000),\nthis decay of energy with the frequencies would follow a power-law function\nto the exponent ?5/3 with the frequencies (wavenumber) of vortices.\n\nFrom our equipment, the closest position to the wall where we could\nobtain velocity information without compromising the quality of measure-\nments corresponded to y0 = 0.46 mm. Figure 5.9 shows the PSD for u?(t)\nusing two di?erent values for y0: one close to the bottom and another far\nfrom it. The energy decay explained before (?5/3) is obtained for isotropic\nturbulence, when ?ow is fully turbulent and developed. It is known that\nclose to the walls such decay might change to ?1 (Radice et al., 2009).\n\n2The PSD Px(f) of a discrete signal x(i) with Nx point is calculated as\n\nPx(f) =\n1\n\nfsNx\n\n?????\nNx?\ni=1\n\nx(i)e?2?jfi/Nx\n\n?????\n2\n\n.\n\n79\n\n\n\n5.

Red line\nindicates ?1 slope; blue line ?5/3 slope. Re = 5625; Fr = 0.87; Sh = 0.060.\n\nFigure 5.9 shows that in both cases, the most part of the ?ow energy is\ntransported by large scale vortices, with low frequencies. The energy decay\nrepresented by the blue dotted line shows the ?5/3 decay, thus roughly\nverifying those scales ?ow correspond to fully turbulent structures. Due to\nthe equipment precision, frequencies higher than 2 Hz might be considered\nas noise as a constant level of energy is achieved. However we can observe a\nslightly di?erent behavior between both PSDs. Around 1 Hz, for y0 = 0.46\nmm (= 2.25D), we see that the decay smooths and tends to the ?1 decay\nwhile for y0 = 1.85 mm (= 9.3D) the decay keeps the ?5/3 decay until\nreach noise level. Then, it might be possible to assume that as closer we\nget to the wall, the energy decay decreases, increasing the energy for larger\neddies with low frequency. This observation is important as in the sub-\nsection 5.2.2 we explore close to wall ?ow ?uctuations to understand solid\ndischarge ?uctuations.\n\n80\n\n\n\n5.2.

This should give enough\ninformation to be able to di?erentiate the results from those obtained in\npulsating ?ows. The reference case is then the sediment transport by a\nturbulent runo? ?ow without superimposed waves.\n\n5.2.1 Mean solid discharge\n\nThe ?rst aspect that we explored in this context is how well the solid dis-\ncharge is represented by the classical empirical formulas that can be found\nin the literature. First of all, after de?ning di?erent zones from each exper-\nimental run (subsection 4.2.3), some remarks must follow:\n\n\u2022 for low and intermediate Shields numbers, up to two mean values of\ntransport q?s can be calculated, one for each zone q\n\nIII\ns and q\n\nIV\ns ;\n\n\u2022 for high Shields numbers, only one zone is identi?ed in the signal\npartitioning, and then only qIVs is kept;\n\n\u2022 for high Shields number, the solid discharge measured is corrected as\nexplained in subsection 4.2.4, using Equation 4.31.\n\nSeven experimental runs were used and summarized in subsection 5.2.1.\nThe results from subsection 5.2.1 show that ?uctuation intensity of solid\n\ntransport are greater than the measurement system precision, thus qualify-\ning the measurement of q?sPTVRMS. The Figure 5.10 shows the results from\nsubsection 5.2.1 in logarithmic and linear axis. It is possible to identify the\nuncertainties from the estimation of Sh ? Shc are more relevant than those\n\n81\n\n\n\n5. Measurements of unsteady sediment transport\n\nfor q?sPTV.

Following the empir-\nical law F (Equation 5.6), we obtained the friction velocity ?uctuation\nintensity u??RMS. To assure minimum quality of measures, we inspect u? at\nthe position y0 = 0.70 mm.\n\nA simple reasoning can be developed based on classical empirical for-\nmulas to corroborate such observation. Considering the following classical\nlaw of transport employed to mean ?ow and mean transport:\n\nq? = A(Sh ? Shc)B = A?(u2? ?u\n2\n?c)\n\nB; (5.10)\n\n82\n\n\n\n5.2. Turbulence e?ects on sediment transport\n\nthen, the expression can be di?erentiated:\n\n?q?\n?u?\n\n= 2A?Bu?\n(u2? ?u2?c)B\n\nu2? ?u2?c\n, (5.11)\n\nand then rewritten as\ndq?\nq?\n\n=\n2Bu?\nu2? ?u2?c\n\ndu?, (5.12)\n\ndq?\nq?\n\n= 2B\nu2?\n\nu2? ?u2?c\ndu?\nu?\n\n= 2B\nSh\n\nSh ? Shc\ndu?\nu?\n\n. (5.13)\n\nIn this expression, the term dq?/q? indicates the ?uctuation intensity of\ntransport and du?/u? the turbulence intensity or the ?uctuation of friction,\nassuming that du? ? u?RMS as u? ? u0. So:\n\ndq?\nq?\n?\nq??RMS\nq??\n\n; (5.14a)\n\ndu?\nu?\n?\nu??RMS\nu?\n\n. (5.14b)\n\nConsequently,\nq??RMS\nq??\n\n= 2B\nSh\n\nSh ? Shc\nu??RMS\nu?\n\n. (5.15)\n\nThis simple expression indicates that close to the imminence of transport\n(Sh ? Shc) ?uctuations of transport goes to in?nity. On the other hand for\nsu?cient high Sh the ?uctuations of transport will be proportional to the\nturbulent intensity of the velocity ?eld. For well-behaved turbulent ?ows\nwhere the ?uctuation intensity follows a constant proportion of mean ?ow\nproperties, q??RMS/q?? should be a constant:\n\nq??RMS\nq??\n\n= 2B\nu??RMS\nu?\n\n. (5.16)\n\nIn our experiments, we measured 14% &lt;u??RMS/u0 &lt;22%, possibly over\nestimated by measurement uncertainty as indicated by 5.5(a).

Dashed lines\nuses maximum and minimum for u??RMS/u?.\n\nu??RMS/u? = 19%.\n\nThe data show that solid discharge ?uctuations are relatively greater for\n?ow Sh ? Shc than Sh ? Shc. This observation is in agreement with the\nEquation 5.15, represented by the blue solid line. Works from the literature\nfor close to threshold bedload transport discuss about the intermittency of\nsolid discharge in those conditions and high ?uctuations of the transport\n(Einstein, 1950; Ancey et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2014).\n\n84\n\n\n\n5.2. Turbulence e?ects on sediment transport\n\nFor high Sh, Sh > 0.2, ?uctuations of transport fall into the shaded zone\nillustrated in Figure 5.11. From the expression 5.15, we estimated that for\nSh ? 4Shc, ?ow would provide enough shear stress to lead transport ?uc-\ntuations into the shaded zone.\n\n5.2.3 Spectral properties of time dependent solid discharge\n\nAs the intensity of ?uctuations have already been discussed in the previous\nsection, here the normalized power spectral density (PSD) of the solid dis-\ncharge signal q(t) is employed to explore the frequency content of the signal.\nThis analysis should provide information comparable to those obtained for\n?ow friction measurements.\n\nFirstly we established a base test where we could explore the features\nthat we should look for in the other cases. The test that is ?rst explored is\nthe experimental run gb1-4, for qIIIs as presents Figure 5.12.\n\nOn Figure 5.12, in gray the part of the PSD (f > 10 Hz), the level of en-\nergy is low, two order of magnitude smaller than the energy present in small\nfrequencies. We than consider that this part of signal would not present any\nsigni?cant information for the work here performed. We perceived that for\nlow frequencies, the decay of energy approximates the ?1 slope (red line)\nand the high levels of energy were present. Around 1 Hz the behavior seems\nto change, adopting ?5/3 decay (blue line). These could be an indication\nthat for low Shields number the relevant energy present in solid discharge\nhave the same expected dynamic for the friction velocity ?uctuations (see\nsubsection 5.1.3). Two other experimental runs for low Shields number were\nstudied to verify that possibility. Their PSD are shown in Figure 5.13.\n\nThe same observations made for experiment gb1-4 were applicable to\ngb1-2 and gb1-3. For Sh slightly above Shc, particles are entrained in con-\ntact with the bed. So, near to bed ?ow turbulent structures would be\nresponsible for particles entrainment. In this way, ?ow turbulent structures\ntransfer their dynamics to particle, and both have the same energy decay\n?1. However, looking more closely to experiment gb1-2, 5.13(a) shows that\nthe de?nition of the ?5/3 slope is not clear. While low frequency ?uc-\ntuations still seem to present ?1, for frequencies between 0.2 and 3 Hz\n(yellow shaded region) the decay of energy does not ?t any of the expected\nbehaviors, almost presenting a constant level of energy distribution. For\nfrequencies higher than 3 Hz, spectral density seems to adopted the ?5/3\n\n85\n\n\n\n5.

For the constant energy level interval (0.2 and 3 Hz), this would cor-\nrespond to a spectral gap, as mentioned by Singh et al. (2009), that could\nbe used to separate di?erent contributions of turbulence.\n\nFor a same experimental run with intermediate Shields number, when-\never solid discharge can be sectioned (subsection 4.2.3), two di?erent PSD\ncan be analyzed. From the literature (Guignier, 2014), there are evidences\nthat when bedforms are formed in the mobile bed, they change how the\nsediment is entrainment. On Figure 5.14 both PSD from qIIIs and q\n\nIV\ns are\n\nplotted. However, the signal qIIIs is considerably shorter than q\nIV\ns , which does\n\nnot give the same quality of results for the PSD.

Pulsating ?ow\n\nIn order to understand this transport reduction, velocity ?uctuations\nwith or without free surface disturbances are presented on Figure 5.17. On\nthe one hand, PIV results (Figure 5.17) show that ?uctuation intensities\nincrease close to the free surface for disturbed ?ow. On the other hand,\nclose to the bottom, no considerable variations of ?uctuation intensity was\ndetected. Another way to verify this is to evaluate u?F , which represents the\nmean friction velocity calculated based on u?(t), for disturbed ?ow. Figure\n5.18 shows variations of u?F for disturbed ?ow in the order of 2% away from\nthe bed, and around 5% when close to the bed.\n\nFigure 5.17: Fluctuation intensity of velocity ?eld for steady and pulsating ?ow.\nSteady ?ow experiments are represented by black symbols and disturbed ?ow by\ngray ones.\n\nA phenomenon that could explain the decrease in bottom shear stress\nis the shape of waves propagating on the free surface. Works from the lit-\nerature (Ng and Mei, 1994; Toniati et al., 2015) present the variation of\nbottom shear stress for roll waves in laminar ?ows. Results presented in\nthe ?gures 2.15 and 5.19 show waves height, mean ?ow velocity and bot-\ntom shear stress over the wavelength. The images are dimensionless and\nthe value 1 in the vertical axis denotes base ?ow properties. We can then\nsee that waves induce a small period of friction increase and a long period of\nreduced friction generating a global reduce of the average friction ( &lt;1), a\n\n91\n\n\n\n5.

In the same way, this e?ect\ncould also be present in turbulent ?ows, thus explaining the reduction of\nsolid transport observed when ?ow is disturbed.\n\n5.3.2 Fluctuations intensities in solid discharge\n\nFollowing the observations from the ?uctuation ?eld Figure 5.17, we know\nthat the disturbances applied to the ?ow are not capable to modify the\n?uctuation intensities close to the bed. So, the empirical relation F can\nbe applied. Such hypothesis allow the same analysis from chapter before\nto be applied, which gives us then the results in Figure 5.20.

Choosing a\nspeci?c model over another relies on the representativeness of that model\nto the target phenomenon. Among mass-movements events, mud?ows are\nnatural events well represented by hydraulic approaches. From this last\nperspective, ?uids in mud?ows are usually modeled as an equivalent non-\nNewtonian ?uid, mixtures of water with high concentration of sediment\n(Graf and Altinakar, 2000).\n\nIt is important to remark that the correct representation of ?uids in this\nkind of phenomena requires attention. The variability found on solid-liquid\nfraction composing the mixture contribute to the complexity of the ?uid\nwhich could also present cohesive or noncohesive behavior, depending on\nthe material in suspension. Then, to exactly quantify shear ratio su?ered\nfrom ?uid due to stress applied is not usually possible. Mud?ows are mix-\ntures which sediment concentration is high and can be characterized mainly\nby the presence of a yield stress and viscous interactions. Moreover, when\ndispersive turbulent stress are remarkably noticed and grain to grain con-\ntact is important, those become the main mechanism of energy dispersion,\nthus characterizing mud ?oods and granular debris ?ow events (Coussot\nand Meunier, 1996). As have been shown on Figure 2.4, the classi?cation\nof the event depends on the ratio between liquid and solid fraction in the\nmixture, and also on particles grain size distribution. Such classi?cation is\nimportant to properly quantify the boundary dissipation and the friction\nfactor, so ?ow properties can be determined.\nThe topography and natural landscape on mountain regions may have fa-\nvorable conditions for roll waves generation. In the past 10 years, several\nmathematical models have been developed on mud and debris ?ows, adding\n\n99\n\n\n\n6. Introduction\n\nup complex features such as arbitrary topography, non-Newtonian ?uid rhe-\nology and assuming unstable conditions of the free surface (van Asch et al.,\n2007; Balmforth and Mandre, 2004; Zanuttigh and Lamberti, 2007), to op-\ntimize the prediction of natural events such as those. the validation and\napplication of such models to practical problems is an important task for\nscienti?c and engineering communities which is not easily performed, as\nillustrated in this thesis. Lack of reliable data of natural events and proper\nrepresentation of physics involved are some of the factors responsible for\nsuch di?culty.\n\nThe Acquabona event from 1998 is one the events registered in the lit-\nerature where the presence of surges in the mud-debris ?ow event can be\nobserved. It was classi?ed by Berti et al. as a debris ?ow event, although\nthey have not quanti?ed the dispersive turbulent term. The problem rests\nopen for a di?erent read of the event as a mud?ow, accordingly to Coussot\nand Meunier (1996); Coussot (1992). As shown in Figure 6.1, mud and\ndebris ?ow present the same behavior, shear-thinning yield stress ?uids,\nwhich can be represented by Herschel-Bulkley rheological model, for exam-\nple. Identify the most indicated rheological behavior based on the concen-\ntration sometimes is not su?cient. For complex rheological ?uid behaviors,\nnot only concentration plays an important role, as well as geometry of parti-\ncles themselves (Mueller et al., 2009) and their chemical and organic nature.\n\nThe objective of the following chapters of this thesis was to evaluate how\ngood an existing model is to predict a natural events, and then to study\nhow adding another control parameter (porosity) would change the model\nrepresentativeness. The event from August 17th, 1998, at Acquabona creek\nrelated by Berti et al. (1999, 2000) was chosen as the case study to analyze\nthe validity of the model proposed by Maciel et al. (2013). The waves pre-\nsented long period and fast propagation velocity and seemed constitute a\nwave train at some point, thus inducing us to think that roll waves could\nhave been generated during the event. Then, a more complex analytical\nmodel was searched considering that the channel bottom was porous. We\nfound a deterministic solution for the velocity pro?le of non-Newtonian ?u-\nids in an open-channel in presence of a porous bed.\n\nTo verify the theoretical solution, numerical simulations on FLUENT\nwere performed. The characteristic present in ?ows over porous medium\nis the presence of a slip velocity at the interface between ?ow and bottom\nchannel, thus reducing bottom shear stress. The problem is summarized in\nvalidating the boundary condition adopted for the deterministic solution.\n\n100\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Conceptual rheological classi?cation of mass movements as a function\nof ?ne content and solid fraction. The exact limits between the di?erent parts of\nthe diagram should be determined for each material and may slightly vary with\n?ow characteristics. (From Coussot (1992).\n\nA parametric study was performed on the mathematical solution to deter-\nmine how non-Newtonian ?uid properties interact with the porosity e?ect\nof the bed. It was observed that the in?uence of bed porosity was smaller\nthe more non-Newtonian the ?uid.\n\n101\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7\n\nApplication of mathematical model to\n\nnatural events: the Acquabona creek\n\n7.1 Mathematical and numerical modeling of roll waves\n\nThe 2D mathematical model for roll waves (Maciel et al., 2013) employed in\nthe present work gives, as result, the free surface pro?le over the longitudinal\ncoordinate as well as wave properties. To obtain such results, a complete\nset of dimensionless input parameters must be determined, namely base\n?ow properties and ?uid rheology (see Figure 7.1). Usually when dealing\nwith measurements obtained from natural events, the necessary parameters\ncannot be determined, thus requiring a pre-processing step to be performed\nbefore solving the roll wave model.\n\nFigure 7.1 shows the two stages necessary to the successful utilization\nof the mathematical model. To the left, the preprocessing stage also called\nparameters gathering: an iterative method performed to solve the constitu-\ntive equations of the problem and to ?nd the proper set of input parameters\nbased on available data for a speci?c event. To the right, the roll waves sim-\nulation procedure, where the set of dimensionless parameter is input into\nthe mathematical.\n\nTo obtain the roll waves equation, which is a ?rst-order nonlinear dif-\nferential equation, the conservation equations, mass and momentum, are\nmanipulated (Equations 2.23a, 2.23b and 2.23c). Same conditions as men-\ntioned on section 2.3 are considered.\n\nThe Herschel-Bulkley rheological model (Equation 2.21) is used in the\n\n103\n\n\n\n7.

Mathematical and numerical modeling of roll waves\n\nviscous part of the stress tensor to represent ?uid properties. Flow is consid-\nered laminar (Re &lt;2000), in shallow water conditions, steady and uniform,\nat instance. The velocity pro?le u(y) is obtained and written as function of\nmean ?ow velocity u0 and rheological properties as shown in Equation 7.1:\n\nu(y) =\n\n??\n?\n(\n\n2n+1\nn+1+nC?\n\n)\nu0\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n(\n1 ? y\n\nh0(1?C?)\n\n)n+1\nn\n\n]\nfor 0 &lt;y &lt;y0(\n\n2n+1\nn+1+nC?\n\n)\nu0 for y0 &lt;y ? h0\n\n, (7.1)\n\nwhere y0 is the limit between sheared ?uid layer and plug zone (y0 = h0(1?\nC?)). This pro?le (Figure 7.2) shows that for such a non-Newtonian ?uid,\nthere is a ?uid layer that assumes constant maximum velocity (plug zone).\nLooking to the y0 &lt;y &lt;h0, we can identify a simple relation between free\nsurface velocity u? = u(y = h0) and mean velocity which can be useful\ngiven by Equation 7.2:\n\nu? =\n\n(\n2n + 1\n\nn + 1 + nC?\n\n)\nu0 (7.2)\n\nFinally, the velocity pro?le can also be represented by its vertical dis-\ntribution through the momentum distribution coe?cient ?:\n\n? =\n1\n\nu20h0\n\n? h0\n0\n\nu(y)2 dy =\n\n(\n2n + 1\n\n3n + 2\n\n)(\nn(4n + 3)C? + 2(n + 1)2\n\n(nC? + n + 1)2\n\n)\n. (7.3)\n\nThis dimensionless parameter can assume values between 1 and 1.2. The\ncloser this value is to one, the greater the plug zone; for Newtonian ?uids,\nthis parameter assumes the value 1.2, classic value in the literature for a\nparabolic velocity pro?le distribution.\n\nThe conservation equations are then vertically averaged by mean values\nfor ?ow height (h0) and velocity (u0). Through this methodology, a dimen-\nsionless system is reached (see Maciel et al. (2013) for further details), a\nSaint-Venant alike system:\n\n?h?\n\n?t?\n+\n?h?u?\n\n?x?\n= 0; (7.4a)\n\nh\n\n(\n?u?\n\n?t?\n+ ?u?\n\n?u?\n\n?x?\n\n)\n+\nh?\n\nFr2\n?h?\n\n?x?\n+ (1 ??)u?\n\n?h?\n\n?t?\n=\n\n= h? ?C? ?

Application of mathematical model to natural events: the\n\nAcquabona creek\n\nand the superscript ? indicates dimensionless variables:\n\nx? = x/L0; y\n? = y/h0; t\n\n? = tu0/L0; u\n? = u/u0.\n\nTo obtain the roll waves equation, dimensionless conservation equations are\nmanipulated using a mobile coordinate system (? = x ? ct) following the\nwaves at their speed c (Julien and Hartley, 1986) which assumes the form:\n\nc\n\nu0\n= ? +\n\n?\n?2 ?? +\n\n1\n\nFr2\n. (7.5)\n\nThe system is then manipulated, culminating in the ?nal form of roll\nwaves equation, a ?rst-order di?erential equation on the ?ow height h (the\nsuperscript that indicate dimensionless system is dropped in this equation\nfor sake of visualization):\n\n?h\n\n??\n=\nh?C? ? (1 ?C?)\n\n[\n(1+c(h?1))(1?C?)(n+1+nC?)\n\n(h?C?)((n+1)h?C?)\n\n]n\n(?? 1)2c2 ? ?(1?c)\n\n2\n\nh2\n+ h\n\nFr2\n\n, (7.6)\n\nThis equation is then numerically solved using Adams-Bashforth-Moulton\nnumerical method. After solved, wave properties are obtained: amplitude\n?h; wavelength ?w; and celerity c.\n\nHowever, such solution only exists when Froude number is greater than\na threshold value Frmin, found through linear stability analysis (Trowbridge,\n1987; Coussot, 1994; Maciel et al., 2013):\n\nFrmin =\n??\n\n?2 ? 2??? + ??2\n, (7.7)\n\nwhere:\n\n? = n(1 ?C?); (7.8a)\n\n? =\n(n + 1)(2n + 1)\n\n(n + 1 + nC?)\n. (7.8b)\n\nNote that Frmin depends on ?uid rheological properties. The roll waves\nequation does not allow a unique solution to be found. So, a supplemen-\ntary step must be executed to search for the most indicate solution to the\nproblem. Usually, one parameter between wavelength ?w or amplitude ?h\nmust be imposed to ?nd the other. Many authors have chosen wavelength\nimposition as it allows spectral analysis of generated waves (Dressler, 1949;\n\n106\n\n\n\n7.2. Site description\n\nNg and Mei, 1994; Liu and Mei, 1994; Pascal, 2006). On this work, we\nadopt the maximum wave amplitude imposition as it allows a more di-\nrected association to hazard intensity at stake. All steps and details of this\nmathematical model can be found in Maciel et al. (2013).\n\nThe model accuracy depends on the correct estimative of input parame-\nters and on rheological properties of ?uid, as will be shown. Sometimes not\nevery parameter can be found/measured thus requiring the pre-processing\nstage (iterative method) to be performed before calculating all dimension-\nless input parameters. This preliminary iterative method is implemented\nso that data available is used to calculate all necessary input parameters\nthrough constitutive equations (Equations 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 and 7.5, as shown\non the left side of Figure 7.1.\n\n7.2 Site description\n\nBerti et al. (1999, 2000); Genevois et al. (2000) did a vast work relating\nthe characteristics of the site and from di?erent mass movement events in\nthe Dolomites region. In this section, we should focus on describing the\nsite where the mass movement event happened following the observations\npublished by those researchers who worked on the event and the site.\n\nThe Acquabona channel is localized on the Dolomites mountains, North-\neast Italy, Southeast from Cortina d'Ampezzo city, having downstream the\nBoite river valley. Morphopedologic properties of region are prone to mass-\nmovement natural events that occur almost every year during rainy season.\nThe channel was equipped to allow data acquisition in three di?erent zones,\nas shows 7.3(a), and for this reason is explored by Italian scienti?c com-\nmunity. The upstream region (region 1) is composed by a limestone rock\nbasin, presenting 30? steepness. Along the channel (region 2), the super-\n?cial soil is composed by rock and gravel presenting mean inclination of\n18?. Downstream (region 3), the channel reaches Boite river, crossing road\nRoma, and presents 7? steepness. The total length of the channel is 1632\nmeters.\n\nThe mixture that formed during the mass movement changed as it ?owed\ndown the channel. The ?uid behavior is given by the aqueous solution of\ngravel (with mean diameter between 2 and 20 mm) and ?ne sediments (sand\nand clay - diameter less than 2 mm). The ?ow is capable of dislodge rocks\nand boulders up to 2 meter in diameter. Fluid fraction of rock with diam-\n\n107\n\n\n\n7. Application of mathematical model to natural events: the\n\nAcquabona creek\n\neter greater than 20 mm can reach 28% of total mixture mass in the body\nof the event, away from the surges front.\n\nDuring ?ow evolution from upstream to downstream, an erosion process\nis remarked by ?uid samples taken from past events (Berti et al., 1999,\n2000) which can be explained by soil composition of intermediate part of\nthe channel that is more susceptible to be eroded. Upstream, roughly 60%\nof ?uid mixture was made by gravel while rough sands (from diameter be-\ntween 65 \u00b5m and 2 mm) and ?nes (silt and clay with diameter smaller than\n65 \u00b5m) have 35% and 5% of its composition, respectively. At intermediate\nlength, ?ne sediments quantity are greater, reaching 20% in volume of ?uid\nmixture. Downstream, ?ne sediments reach 30% of mixture, pointing out\nchannel erodibility, as shows 7.3(b).\n\n(a) (b)\n\nFigure 7.3: From Genevois et al. (2000). 7.3(a): Location of Acquabona moni-\ntoring site. 7.3(b): Grain size distribution envelopes of Acquabona debris ?ows\nmixture composition; a - region 1, source area and upstream marls ?ow channel;\nb - region 2, downstream marls ?ow channel; c - region 3, deposition area.\n\nData collected praised pluviometry, wind speed, waves velocity (geo-\nphones), ?ow height (ultrasonic devices), ?ow super?cial velocity (image\nprocessing) and pressure gauges. In the present work, we manipulated\nthese data to estimate ?uid rheological properties and ?ow dynamics (?ow\ndischarge). This new information, along with the reported site topography,\nshould constitute all necessary data input for model.\n\n108\n\n\n\n7.3. Event sample\n\n7.3 Event sample\n\nDuring the summer of 1998, on August 17th, a large debris ?ow event oc-\ncurred on Acquabona channel and data were collected and published by\n(Berti et al., 2000). This data is used here as a test case to verify the rep-\nresentativity of the mathematical model presented before.\n\nMeasurements from pluviometer at inlet station showed that the rain\nthat initiated the event reached 25 mm during 30 minutes and that the a\n?rst surge happened after 45 minutes of rain, when rainfall reached 20 mm.\nThe total volume displaced estimated was 8000-9000 m3.\n\nStartup mechanisms of bed mobilization were elucidated and discussed\nby the authors in details. However, in this work we identi?ed a particular\nfeature in the event of August 17th, 1998: the mass movement registered\npresent a roll waves-like free surface evolution. More than 15 surges (as\nmentioned by (Berti et al., 2000)) of mud and debris were identi?ed during\n35 minutes after the ?rst surge, as shows Figure 7.4. The idea that will be\npursued in this work is that the referenced sequence of surges could have\nformed a roll waves-like pattern.\n\nFrom a practical point of view, the stage where the wave train is detected\nseems random and waves with di?erent amplitude, celerity and wavelength\nare measured. However, roll waves are a permanent free surface instabili-\nties. They are generated by spatial-temporal disturbances (Di Cristo and\nVacca, 2005) in the ?ow which can be regular or random. In this case, we\ndeal with a natural phenomenon where a broad set of frequencies could have\ndisturbed the system. This could explain the variability of wave patterns\nnoticed and the unsteadiness of waves, being more like a transitional regime.\n\nTo make an application of a mathematical model possible, we should\nidentify a well-behaved set of waves which could be a good example of a\nroll waves formation in quasi-steady con?guration. In this way, we gathered\nthe results, calculated mean values of them, which allowed us to acquire the\nnecessary input parameters for the simulation of a typical case, which could\nbe representative of the natural waves measured. The waves identi?ed by\nA, B, C, D and E on Figure 7.4 present a relatively well-behaved amplitude\nand wavelength when compared to others waves. We identify the end of the\nwave train at 1308 seconds.\n\n109\n\n\n\n7. Application of mathematical model to natural events: the\n\nAcquabona creek\n\nFigure 7.4: Measurements from station 3, downstream channel, collected through\nultrasonic equipment on August 17th, 1998, related by Berti et al. (2000). High-\nlighted wave train identi?ed as possible roll wave formation.\n\n7.4 Parameters gathering\n\nFor the speci?c event of Acquabona creek, some necessary parameters re-\nquired for roll waves model was missing, namely the mean ?ow height and\nvelocity (h0 and u0 respectively), and also ?uid rheological properties. The\ndata shown and analyzed in this section is part of the pre-processing stage,\nreferenced on Figure 7.1. First of all, results collected from pressure trans-\nducer showed that ?uid pressure was equal to the bottom normal stress,\nthus leading to the conclusion that hydrostatic conditions is applicable.\nThis observation allows employment of the model presented before.\n\nQualitative observations and data collected from soil showed that ma-\nterial density (from rocks, gravel and sands) should be around 2000 kgm?3.\nThen, from mass concentration ?m = 60% (Zanuttigh and Lamberti, 2007),\nwe can compute volume concentration ?v as 43% and mixture density 1430\nkgm?3. For the compounded mixture (water + clay or water + ?ne sand\n+ clay) investigated in this work, rheometric studies from Coussot (1994),\nPiau (1996), Huang and Garcia (1998), Santos (2003), Maciel et al. (2009)\nand many others proved that neglecting sedimentation e?ects, ?uid rheol-\nogy can be described by the Herschel-Bulkley non-linear rheological model,\nin permanent simple shearing conditions. As explained by Ancey (2007),\nmixtures mainly composed by clay (colloidal mixtures) have strong non-\nNewtonian behavior and yield stress exponentially increase with material\nconcentration. Based on experimental rheological studies (Coussot and\nPiau, 1994; Rema\u00eetre et al., 2005; Ancey, 2007; Maciel et al., 2009), yield\nstress (?0) is roughly estimated around 200 Pa. Concerning index ?ow,\nsome results show that it stabilizes around 0.30, which is not far from 1/3\n\n110\n\n\n\n7.4. Parameters gathering\n\ncalibrated for French torrential lava by Coussot (1994). Although di?culty\nto predict rheological parameters, consistency index Kn can be estimated\nfrom 50 to 1000 Pasn by the same works.\n\nFreestream velocity u? was recorded by Berti et al. (2000) through\nvideo and image processing. Values obtained after the ?rst surge and be-\nfore the wave train (t &lt;900 s) suggest that mean freestream velocity was\nabout 3.46 ms?1. Wave celerity and amplitude are related on left side\nof Table 7.1. Measurements of water depth from ultrasonic device is not\ncompletely reliable, since the channel was eroded during the event (chan-\nnel bottom reference is lost). The iterative method (previously explained\non section 7.1) was then applied using the other parameters found (?uid\ncharacteristics, free surface velocity and wave celerities) to calculate such\ninformation. Using the available data, the iterative method was performed\nusing equations 7.2, 7.3 and 7.5. Values for u0 and h0 were found for each\nwave, as shown in the right side of Table 7.1. Mean values were also cal-\nculated, as shown in the last line of Table 7.1, using mean values for waves\ncelerities and amplitudes. The method was initialized assuming u0 = u?\nand ? = 1. Calculations follow in loop until all parameters have values that\nhave converged.\n\nTable 7.1: Waves properties collected from Berti et al. (1999) and ?ow properties\ncalculated using Maciel et al.

Non-Newtonian e?ect on maximum wave prediction\n\nThe ?rst evidence is that simulations do not present satisfactory ampli-\ntudes for each wave separately. However, when comparing to mean ampli-\ntude of wave train selected, the model would be rather capable to identify\nthe proper scale of waves amplitude presenting di?erence of 8%. To under-\nstand the variability of results and a possible source of discrepancies, we\nevaluated the e?ects of non-Newtonian properties on results in the following\nsection 7.6.\n\n7.6 Non-Newtonian e?ect on maximum wave prediction\n\nRheological properties of ?uid play an important role on waves properties.\nBased on typical results given by the model, we evaluated how would wave's\namplitude change with rheological parameters. The assumption that sedi-\nment concentration would change along the channel as bed erosion advanced\nis plausible and veri?ed by (Berti et al., 1999, 2000).\n\nAs can be observed in Figure 7.5, for weak non-Newtonian e?ects (smaller\nyield stress and greater index ?ow), waves amplitude decrease. Conversely,\nfor strong non-Newtonian e?ects (greater yield stress, and smaller index\n?ow), the opposite is noticed.\n\nChoosing two extreme cases, as discriminates Table 7.4, waves amplitude\ncan vary depending on non-Newtonian e?ects, yield stress and index ?ow.\nGiven the set of parameters, a less non-Newtonian ?uid would generate\nroll waves amplitudes 20% smaller than the expected case, . The opposite\nhappens for more non-Newtonian ?uids, as they increase roll waves am-\nplitudes in 6% in comparison to expected waves amplitude, as illustrates\nFigure 7.6. Then, the variation in time of ?uid composition could explain\nthe observed scattering of wave height data reported by Berti et al. (2000).\nQualitatively, we noticed that ?uid rheological properties can also a?ect\nwavelength/period, as shows Figure 7.6.\n\n7.7 Roll waves modeling as a risk assessment tool\n\nFrom an Engineering point of view, relation between speci?c discharge and\nthe mean ?ow height allows further identi?cation of risks at stake during\nan event.

Vertical bar\nindicates prediction of mean ?ow height using cases from Table 7.4, for less and\nmore non-Newtonian ?uids.\n\nOne important feature to notice is the minimum discharge for roll waves\nto be prone to be generated. For turbulent inviscid ?ows, low discharge\nwould be required, since the channel have high slope. For Fr > 2, qRWCh >\n0.002 m2s?1, then most of the inviscid-turbulent curve shown in Figure 7.7\nrepresent a favorable domain for roll waves appearance. Such value would\n\n116\n\n\n\n7.7. Roll waves modeling as a risk assessment tool\n\nincrease for laminar ?ows: qRWN > 1.07; and qRWNN > qmin = 0.35 m\n2s?1.\n\nThis fact indicates that roll waves could have appeared for speci?c discharge\nmuch lower than qacqua. Since turbulent inviscid approach would fail to\nproperly predict the mean ?ow height, we evaluated roll waves for the two\nother cases. The roll waves domain for viscous laminar ?ows present waves\nthat have smaller amplitudes than those for the non-Newtonian domain.\nThis results points out that, in any case scenario, in addition to the non-\nNewtonian rheology, roll waves model should be considered to predict the\nevent of Acquabona creek in 1998.\n\n117\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8\n\nSearch for a more complex model\n\n8.1 Introduction\n\nOne problem in ?uid mechanics that recently has been more addressed is\nthe dynamics of Herschel-Bulkley ?uids in presence of a porous medium.\nEven though non-Newtonian ?uids have been largely studied on that matter\n(Sabiri and Comiti, 1995; Sochi, 2010), the presence of yield is not easily\nassigned. The kernel of the problem resides in the interaction between the\nnature of the ?uid (mixture, suspension, etc.) and the void geometry that\nconstitutes the porous medium. When dealing with suspensions, for exam-\nple, particles can be clogged inside the voids by many capture processes,\nwhich then would change the porosity of the medium over time (Herzig\net al., 1970), thus completely changing the problem itself. However, when\ndealing with oil industry problems and polymers, yield non-Newtonian ?u-\nids can sometimes interact with porous boundaries.\n\nThe problem that is undertaken in this chapter is how dynamics of a non-\nNewtonian ?uid ?ow presenting Herschel-Bulkley rheology would change\ndue the presence of a permeable medium as boundary condition. Open-\nchannel ?ow was considered, so that the permeable medium, or porous\nmedium, was found in the bottom of the channel. The porous medium is\ncomposed by ?xed particles of diameter D, arranged randomly. This prob-\nlem could somehow not only be related to technical and industrial issues\nbut also be related to natural ?ows, where conditions allow.\n\nHere again, the conditions announced on section 2.3 are valid. The con-\nservation equations are represented by the system of equations 2.23a, 2.23b\nand 2.23c. The di?erence that is present in this problem is that ?uid is\n\n119\n\n\n\n8. Search for a more complex model\n\nallowed to ?ow inside the medium that composes the bed, which now is\n?xed1. The bed have a porosity p, i.e. void space in bed material su?cient\npermeable for ?ow ?uid to ?ll them in. At this point, we should have what\nis called a Darcian-like ?ow, as illustrates Figure 8.1. For the steady and\nuniform case, velocity and free surface height are both constant values u0\nand h0, respectively. Inside the porous medium a ?ow is also established\nwith velocities up and vp.\n\nFigure 8.1: Schematic representation of ?ow. The non-Newtonian ?uid is now\n?owing inside the porous bed.\n\n8.2 Mathematical development\n\n8.2.1 Boundary Condition\n\nIt is required to ?nd the relationship between pressure drop on porous\nmedium and Darcian velocity (up,vp) to properly assume the boundary\nconditions on the interface bed-?uid. A large review on the subject is\npresented on Chhabra et al. (2001) where dynamics of non-Newtonian ?uids\n(power-law ?uids) on di?erent porous media are related. In that work, the\nauthors made clear that ?uid properties greatly change its dynamics inside\ntortuous paths a?ecting the macro behavior, which is summarized by a\nDarcy's Law type relation. Following previous works from Beavers and\nJoseph (1967) and Rao and Mishra (2004), we assumed continuity of shear\n\n1In this case, either ?ow is saturated and there is a balance between erosion and\ndeposition, and bed is plane; or ?ow erosional capacity is no longer su?cient to entrain\nbed material\n\n120\n\n\n\n8.2. Mathematical development\n\nrate on the interface through the following boundary condition:\n\n?u\n\n?y\n\n????\ny=0\n\n=\n?\n\nk\n1\n\nn+1\n\n(u?up). (8.1)\n\nwhere ? is a form factor of voids inside the porous medium and k is the\npermeability of the porous medium.\n\nThe shearing conditions exhibited by equation 8.1 can be assumed as the\nnon-Newtonian e?ect from yield stress is comprised by means of longitudinal\nDarcian velocity up. The other boundary condition is related to the normal\nvelocity in the porous medium which, on the interface, should not vary once\nit is inside the boundary layer. So:\n\nvp = v, for y = 0. (8.2)\n\nRecalling the recent work from Chevalier et al. (2013), those authors\npresent an adaptation of Darcy's Law to Herschel-Bulkley ?uids based on\nexperimental data for a polymeric solution of Carbopol ?owing through a\nporous medium. Chevalier et al. advised that the relation between pressure\ndrop and Darcian velocity should have the form\n\n?\n?pp\n?x\n\n=\n?0\nkI\n\n+\nKn\nkK\n\nunp, (8.3)\n\nwhere kI and kK, de?ned in this thesis, are porous medium parameters\nrelating shape, dispersion of material inside the pores and voids of porous\nmedium. Both parameters correspond to the permeability used to de?ne\nproperties of porous medium. The ?rst parameter kI we call here inertial\npermeability. It represents how the structure of the porous medium coupled\nto the non-Newtonian rheology opposes the movement of the ?uid. The\nsecond one we call kinematic permeability: its understand as the classical\npermeability coe?cient, and it measures the ability of the porous material\nto allow ?uids to ?ow through it. Following the work previously mentioned\n(Chevalier et al., 2013), both variables should be function of the shape of\nthe porous medium, although the second one also depends on the ?uid\nrheology, as shows Equations 8.4 and 8.5 for a ?xed porosity:\n\nkI =\nD\n\n4\n; (8.4)\n\nkK =\nDn+1\n\n4(6 + 2/n)n\n, (8.5)\n\nwhich is called in the present work as inertial and kinetic permeability,\nrespectively. For a variable porosity, Equation 8.5 could be represented as\n\n121\n\n\n\n8. Search for a more complex model\n\npoints Christopher and Middleman (1965) through Equation 8.6:\n\nkK =\n6\n\n25\n\n(\nnp\n\n3n + 1\n\n)n [\npD\n\n3(1 ?p)\n\n]n+1\n. (8.6)\n\nThe concepts here presented, adapted from Darcy's Law for Newtonian\n?uids, can only be guaranteed for non-Newtonian ?uids as long as ?uids do\nnot present special interactions with the medium. Filtration and clogging,\nfor example, which have been taken into account during experiments from\nChevalier et al. (2013) do not properly ?t when solid particles with con-\nsiderable size are in suspension. Particles in suspensions must have mean\ndiameter much smaller than pore space, so that no clogging of microchan-\nnels happens, and porosity is kept constant. Then, adapting Darcy's law\nfor a Herschel-Bulkley ?uid,\n\nup = ?\n(\nkK\nKn\n\n)1/n [(\n?Pp\n?x\n\n+\n?0\nkI\n\n)1/n\n??g sin ?\n\n]\n; (8.7)\n\n?up\n?x\n\n+\n?vp\n?y\n\n= 0; (8.8)\n\n?Pp\n?y\n\n= ??g cos ?, (8.9)\n\nwhere Pp represent total pressure in the porous medium and Pp = P for\ny = 0.

(8.31)\n\n126\n\n\n\nChapter 9\n\nNumerical simulations\n\nTo verify the mathematical solution proposed in chapter 8, numerical simu-\nlations were carried in FLUENT c\u00a91 using experimental data of carbopol so-\nlutions from the literature. Numerical schemes used to solve equations were\nbased on ?nite volume method for steady laminar ?ow (Patankar and Spald-\ning, 1972; Versteg and Malalasekera, 1995). For the pressure-velocity cou-\npling, semi-implicit method for pressure-linked equations-consistent (SIM-\nPLEC) method was applied (VanDoormal and Raithby, 1984). Pressure in-\nterpolation was conducted using the pressure staggering option (PRESTO)\nroutine. For the convective terms, a second order user-de?ned scalar was\nused and for the free surface computation, the implicit volume of ?uid high\nresolution interface capturing (HRIC) scheme was chosen (Ubbink and Issa,\n1999). Two-dimensional domain was meshed using non-uniform trilateral\npolygons. The re?nement level of the meshing depended on the proximity\nto the objects composing the bed. The mesh was dense (? 10?4m cross-\nsectional length for cell grids) for the carbopol phase (inside the porous\nmedium and in free ?ow) and sparse for the air phase ((? 10?2m).\n\nThe non-Newtonian rheology is implemented in the software using Pa-\npanastasiou (1987) Herschel-Bulkley rheological model:\n\n? = ?0\n(\n1 ?e?m??\n\n)\n+ Kn??\n\nn (9.1)\n\nwhere the exponent m is responsible for the growth rate of stress to respect\nthe shear rate ?? = ?u\n\n?y\n.

Numerical simulations\n\n9.1 Numerical modeling\n\nThe model test chosen was based on previous studies from Prinos et al.\n(2003) and Chan et al. (2007). The porous bed is modeled as a macroscopic\nporous medium composed by 2D disk of diameter D, uniformly spaced in\nthe domain between impermeable wall at y = 0 and y = hp, as shows\nFigure 9.1. l1 is the vertical distance between ?rst disk and impermeable\nwall and l2 is vertical distance between disks. The porous bed element\nshown has length Lp and is periodic along channel length. The porosity is\nthen calculated by total porous bed element domain (Sp = hpLp) and wall\ndisks surface (Sw) as p = 1 ?Sp/Sw.\n\nFigure 9.1: Schematic illustration of computational element of the porous bed.\nThe element repeats its pattern along the total length of computational domain\nwhere the bottom impermeable wall is the loer boundary of the domain.\n\nGeometry of bed and test-?uid properties are ?xed constant following\nparameters shown on tables 9.1 and 9.2, respectively. The ?uid chosen for\nsimulations was based on Leite (2009) and Roberts and Barnes (2001)'s\nexperiments. Carbopol solutions are versatile ?uids that have been largely\nemployed on non-Newtonian ?uid experiments. Gravity and inlet discharge\nwere then controlled to obtain di?erent experimental runs described Ta-\nble 9.3.

For a internal ?ow (no\natmospheric pressure), such value can be estimated based on the geometry\nof porous medium, in our case, the disposition of rods in our porosity com-\nputational element. As well for on open-channel ?ows, this value should\nvary depending on the complex interaction between ?ow and porous geom-\netry. To obtain such value, the maximum correlation between discharges\nfrom both results was sought, varying ? parameter on Equation 8.18. A\nmean value ? = 0.191 was found, which seems in agreement with previous\nworks (0.1 &lt;? &lt;4) (Beavers and Joseph, 1967; Pascal, 2006).\n\nThen, the velocity pro?le can be compared, as shows 9.4 numerical runs\nQ1I3 and Q1I4. When comparing velocity pro?les between tests with the\nsame discharge (Figure 9.5), its possible to identify that behavior of curves\nis similar thus pointing out that theoretical relation also represent those\nresults. These results clearly show that the slip velocity, or bottom velocity\nuB = u(y = 0) should depend on ?ow and/or ?uid and/or porous medium\nparameters, as expected (Equation 8.20).\n\nApart from mean ?ow velocity, two other characteristics velocities can\nbe used to evaluate agreement between results and mathematical model:\nbottom slip velocity uB; and plug ?ow velocity uy0. The ?rst one presents\na 4.8% standard deviation around 1, towards equivalence. For the second\non, a standard deviation is found to be 0.3% around 0.99, thus presenting\na tendency of underestimating plug ?ow velocity.

For small yield stress (small C?) considerable e?ect of porosity\n(great ?), the curve ?ts the boundary condition. This could indicate that\nthe boundary conditions adopted would require further improvement to bet-\nter ?t the characteristics of the ?ow here explored. Other e?ects might as\nwell contribute to the discrepancy observed as the geometry of the ?ow, for\nexample.\n\n134\n\n\n\n9.3. Mathematical analysis\n\nFigure 9.7: Veri?cation of boundary condition validity. Dotted line indicate per-\nfect correlation between theory and numerical results.\n\n9.3 Mathematical analysis\n\nThe velocity pro?le u(y) is studied to respect the plug velocity u(y0) which\ncorresponds to the freestream velocity (free surface velocity), and the ver-\ntical coordinate y to respect y0 thus scaling the problem, as shows equation\n9.3.\n\nU(Y ) =\nu(y)\n\nu(y0)\n=\n\n[\n1 ?\n\n(1 ?Y )\nn+1\nn\n\n1 + ?\n(\nn+1\nn\n\n)] , (9.3)\nwhere Y = y/y0. It's also valuable to de?ne the free surface height which\nshould be equal to H0 = h0/y0 = 1/(1?C?). Mean ?ow velocity Um is then\ncalculated as\n\nU? =\n1\n\nH0\n\n[? 1\n0\n\nU(Y )DY +\n\n? H0\n1\n\nDY\n\n]\n. (9.4)\n\nThe e?ect of the porous bed over the velocity can be summarized as the\npromotion of a slip velocity on the interface between the bed and the ?ow.\nFigure 9.8 shows that for a solid bed (? = 0), interface velocity U|Y =0 = 0.\n\n135\n\n\n\n9. Numerical simulations\n\nHowever, the smallest increase in bed porosity leads to a non-zero velocity\nat the interface. For shear thinning ?uids (n &lt;1), the interface velocity\nincreases more rapidly with porosity.\n\nWhen in presence of a yield stress, the same behavior is noticed. This\ne?ect lead to a mean ?ow velocity Um which is closer to freestream velocity\nthe higher yield stress parameter C?, as shows ?gure 9.8. This observa-\ntion is in agreement with the plug zone which is greater as the yield stress\nincreases, thus leading to a quasi-constant velocity distribution over the ver-\ntical coordinate. Numerical and, most importantly, experimental validation\nof the velocity pro?le should be employed to assure hypothesis adopted in\nthis work. When dealing with ?uid composed by sediment particles, per-\ncolation e?ect can hardly be avoided, thus obstructing the proper use of\nsuch mathematical development. However, for homogeneous ?uids such as\nemulsions and gels, these assumptions should be reasonable and could be\nveri?ed experimentally.\n\nSupposing the same discharge (q = u0h0) entering a non-porous bed\n(? = 0), Equation 9.4 can be used to calculate the mean ?ow velocity\nin these conditions U?|?=0, and compared to the one when a porous bed is\npresent. Figure 9.9 shows that a signi?cant increase in mean ?ow velocity is\nobtained when ?uid have low yield stress level. However, high level of yield\nindicates that a greater plug zone is formed, thus diminishing the in?uence\nof the slip velocity, therefore the in?uence of porosity, as we can see in the\nlast picture from Figure 9.9. These observations, especially concerning the\nincrease of velocity, corroborate the in?uence of the porous bed.\n\n136\n\n\n\n9.3.

The relation found between the\nmean ?ow velocity and ?ow height can give a new insight of the Acquabona\nevent of 1998.\n\n10.1 Parameter gathering\n\nIn order to correctly employ the mathematical model proposed in chapter 8,\nthe proper input parameters should be found. When considering the porous\nbed, some properties are needed: porosity of the bed p; mean particles di-\nameter that compose the bed D50; a form factor ? for the voids that would\nhave been formed in between the sediment material in the Acquabona re-\ngion.\n\nAs elucidated in Kasenow (2001), the porosity found in the dolomites\nare between 0.191 and 0.327. However, as the event takes place in a slope\ndeposit region downstream the dolomite region, we consider that the soil\nwas mainly composed by gravels and sedimentary material. We arbitrarily\nchoose p = 0.4, and will evaluate how the same parameter could a?ect the\nprediction of the results.\n\nIt is understood that the natural channel formed in the Acquabona re-\ngion was carved by successive mass movements. In this way, we can consider\nthat the bottom of that channel is composed by past events. Then, events\nreported before the event or even later events can inform the mean sed-\niment size of particles diameter. (Gregoretti and Fontana, 2008) related\n\n139\n\n\n\n10. Revisiting Acquabona\n\nmany events in the Acquabona region and a particular measure was done\nin August 2000 (after the event here studied). The measures all point out\nthat the mean particle size can be chosen as D50 = 0.137 meter.\n\nThe void shape factor ? is the most uncertain parameter among all.\nIts value is often ?xed between 0.1 and 4 in the literature, but no precise\nmethod to determine its value have been developed yet. The assessment\nof ? in?uence will be a part of the evaluation of the results here presented.\nFor the ?rst simulation that will be shown, we adopted ? = 0.25.\n\n10.2 Recalculating Acquabona event\n\nUsing the parameters gathered before and solving the equations, the com-\nparison can be made using the last ?gure from chapter 7 using now also\na curve for the non-Newtonian rheology ?uid ?ow when in presence of a\nporous bed (Figure 10.1).\n\nIt is observed that given the same speci?c discharge q0, for a same ?uid\ntype, ?ow height is smaller when in presence of the porous bed. This is due\nto the reduced friction on the bottom (smaller sheared zone) induced by the\nslip velocity in the boundary between the bed and the ?ow. Close to the\nspeci?c discharge qacqua where ? = 0.03, the di?erence measured for mean\n?ow height is about 5% from porous to ?xed bed. Since less resistance is\nfelt by ?ow, the velocity should be greater when in presence of a porous\nbed. Such reasoning was explored in chapter 10. We can construct the\nsame kind of ?gure for the mean ?ow velocity as shows Figure 10.2, where\nthe variation of velocity is around 5%.\n\nBoth ?gures presented before can be summarized by means of the pa-\nrameter ? (Equation 8.18). As bed porous properties are kept constant\nand speci?c discharge is increased, h0 increases so leading to a smaller ?\nparameter.Figure 10.3 presents the same results from Figures 10.1 and 10.2\nnow using the ratio between mean ?ow properties for non-Newtonian ?uids\n?owing over a porous bed and those for ?xed bed (? = 0).\n\nThe dimensionless parameter of porosity ? would vary from 0.02 to 0.2,\ndepending on the ?ow discharge rate which promoted variations on mean\n?ow properties of approximately 7%, as shows Figure 10.3. Such variations\ncould be in the same order of magnitude as measurements uncertainties,\nthus rendering their e?ects unnoticeable. As elucidated on chapter 10, the\n\n140\n\n\n\n10.2.

We have\nfocused the research on two main stages of the development of a potential\nmud?ow: the surface runo? and the mud?ow itself.\n\nFor the ?rst stage, an experimental approach was considered and the\nmain idea was to inspect the time properties of the solid transport, com-\nposed by a mean value and ?uctuations. The methodology here employed\nwas developed and tested for some test cases and seems to be a powerful\ntool for sediment discharge study in time. A simple method for ?ow friction\nmeasurements was adapted from aeolian transport experiments and proved\nto be a reasonable method to understand the energy distribution in ?ow\nfriction due to turbulent structures.\n\nExperimental runs were performed and their results were studied regard-\ning mean, ?uctuation and spectral behaviors. It was shown that ?uctuations\nof solid transport depend almost instantaneously on ?ow ?uctuations fol-\nlowing the relation between averaged transport and averaged friction. As\nfree-surface instabilities were applied to the ?ow, it seems that the mean\nsolid discharge is reduced. Conversely the ?uctuations intensities of solid\ntransport increase. This would constitute a result that could give directions\nfor practical Engineering purpose, pointing out that instabilities presence\nactually diminish erosion and sediment entrainment..\n\nFor the second stage, a ?rst-order mathematical model for roll-waves\nfree surface instabilities was used to simulate a natural mass movement\nevent registered in the literature. The properties of the ?uid were found\nto greatly in?uence the predictability of the model, an observation greatly\n\n147\n\n\n\n11. Discussion and conclusions\n\nmentioned in the literature. However, the model seems to work well and\nto give coherent insight on the waves properties, even for a highly ran-\ndom event. We highlight that such use of the model would have practical\napplications in Engineering for risk assessment and control of risk zones, al-\nthough it might be required more validation based on in situ measurements.\n\nIn order to understand how the complexity of the problem would change\nas porosity e?ect is added to the problem, a mathematical model was pro-\nposed for non-Newtonian ?uids ?ow over a porous medium. Given the\nanalytical solution, numerical simulations were performed to explore the\ncompatibility with the mathematical results. Good agreement was found\nbetween both, although it seems that the boundary condition used would\nrequire further investigation. The test-case used to analyze the roll waves\nmathematical model was then reevaluated to check whether the porosity\ne?ect would change the overall prediction.\n\n11.1 Runo? ?ows and time-variable transport\n\n11.1.1 Experimental method\n\nThe experimental method employed to assess a time-variable value for fric-\ntion velocity, rather intuitive, have proven its capacity to understand the\n?ow energy distribution in the spectral domain. The drawback in our case\ncomes from the fact that ?ow and transport measurements were performed\nin two separate set of experiments. It allowed a statistical analysis of the\nrelations between mean and ?uctuating quantities but not a real time rela-\ntion between simultaneous values of them. However, since the ?uctuations\nof the velocity ?eld showed good agreement with results from the literature,\nconclusions on instantaneous relation could be postulated.\n\nThe methodology employed to measured the solid discharge has proven\nits usefulness and allowed many analysis to be performed. One main tech-\nnical issue found during experiments was that the light source used in ex-\nperiments should be as uniform as possible and ?uid should be clean. Such\ncombination gives a good contrast level in images between ?uid and shadow\nfrom particles. If no good contrast is found, images will require further im-\nage processing, which might induce noise and error in particles detection.\nAt this point, the enhancing technique developed works in most of the times,\nand only results that were proven to be generated from properly detection\n\n148\n\n\n\n11.1. Runo? ?ows and time-variable transport\n\nhave been studied.\n\nSome corrections must be applied to the signals depending on the mor-\nphological characteristics of particles detected since the model uses the in-\ndividual mass and velocity of each particle to calculate the solid discharge.\nThose corrections are explained and are corroborated by the results pre-\nsented.\n\n11.1.2 Time-dependent solid discharge in turbulent permanent ?ow\n\nWe developed three main analysis in the solid discharge signals: mean solid\ndischarge against Shields number; ?uctuation intensities of solid discharge;\nand spectral properties of non-stationary solid discharge.\n\nThe ?rst analysis based on the mean sediment transport allowed to eval-\nuate the quality of the results when comparing to classical empirical laws\nfrom the literature. For the experimental runs presented in steady solid\ndischarge, results are congruent with the empirical laws of (Meyer-Peter\nand M\u00fcller, 1948) and (Wong and Parker, 2006).\n\nTo understand the role of ?uctuations of friction velocity to the sediment\ntransport, we derived an expression from the averaged transport, that re-\nlates both of them. This relation present a strong non-linearity when close\nto threshold ?ows (Sh ? Shc). Scaling the ?uctuation intensities of trans-\nport with its mean value, we observed that ?uctuations are high when close\nto the imminence of transport (Sh ? Shc) and they reach a constant value\nfor Sh > 4Shc. We show then that ?uctuations of transport are related to\n?uctuations of ?ow. The constant value reached for su?cient high Shields\nnumber is related to the intensity of turbulence in ?ow, which should be\nconstant given ?xed geometry and ?ow discharge. The increase in ?uctu-\nations when close to threshold is related to the non-linearity of transport\nbehavior due to the threshold of movement. Both e?ects are captured by\nthe empirical law derived in the present work.\n\nThe power spectral density allows the observation on how sediment\ntransport energy distribution is made. We detected that two factors can\na?ect the way sediment transport happens in time:\n\n\u2022 bedforms;\n\n\u2022 turbulent ?uctuations;\n\n149\n\n\n\n11. Discussion and conclusions\n\nThe PSDs show that sediment transport energy is distributed accord-\ningly to a turbulent ?ow: low frequencies have high energy and high fre-\nquencies have low energy. Whenever only turbulence seems to a?ect the\nbedload transport, close to bed turbulent structures are responsible for the\n?uctuations found in the solid discharge. Low frequencies (thus large time\nscale structures) present an energy decay to high frequencies equals to ?1.\nThis slope would correspond to the decay of energy of turbulent structures\nclose toe bed. However, when bedforms appear, they seem to homogenize\n?ow turbulence and the energy decay assumes the ?5/3 exponent. This de-\ncay of energy would rather represent isotropic turbulent ?ow, which could\nonly be present away from the walls (Radice et al., 2009). This fact could\nbe an evidence on how the bedforms can alter the kind of transport mode,\nmaking turbulent structures have more in?uence on particles dynamics.\nSuch observations have also been made by Guignier (2014) in experiments\nin closed channel ?ow, where they observed that mean solid discharge in-\ncrease whenever bedforms starts to develop.\n\n11.1.3 Time-dependent solid discharge in pulsating ?ows\n\nFor the unsteady transport when ?ow disturbances were applied, the ?rst\nanalysis shows a decrease in solid transport. Given the same ?ow conditions\n(Re, Fr and Sh), disturbing the system clearly decrease the mean solid dis-\ncharge, i.e. ?ow capacity of transporting sediments. However, the empirical\ncorrelation keeps its power law form, conserving the exponent between 1.5\nor 1.8, as present the results.\n\nThe ?rst logical assumption is that ?ow mean friction velocity has been\nreduced. Since the friction velocity is related to the turbulence level of the\n?ow, we have observed the intensities of ?uctuation ?eld. Horizontal ?uc-\ntuation intensities showed greater values close to the free surface, but not\n?uctuations close to the bed where they kept the same magnitude, and did\nnot presented any signi?cant reduction that could explain the decrease ob-\nserved in solid transport. The explanation could lie in the waveform of the\nfree instabilities. As observed for roll waves mathematical solutions (Noble,\n2004; Ng and Mei, 1994; Toniati et al., 2015), the bottom shear stress follows\nthe shape of the free surface, sometimes presenting a lag. The shape, like a\nwave train, have a trough period greater than the peak period. Such e?ect\nwould make the mean bottom shear stress to be reduced when compared\nto the uniform and steady ?ow. Another possible explanation relates the\nelements of energy dissipation for a given averaged ?ow discharge allegedly\n\n150\n\n\n\n11.1. Runo? ?ows and time-variable transport\n\nFigure 11.1: Energy budget for a turbulent volume of a ?ow. Total energy of\n?ow = E? + e?.

If energy dissipation is partitioned between\nmean and ?uctuating dissipations, the presence of waves increases the ?uc-\ntuating component (which do not change mean values). This would indicate\nthat mean ?ow would have less dissipation, thus inducing a reduced wall\nfriction (related to D on Figure 11.1) responsible for the sediment transport.\n\nThe ?uctuation intensities of solid discharge show an interesting aspect.\nBased on the results shown in Figure 5.20, we see that applying a distur-\nbance into the free surface of the ?ow induces an increase in solid discharge\n?uctuations. As we proved, solid particles in movement follow the ?ow char-\nacteristics in the same way: mean solid transport are related to mean ?ow\nproperties; ?uctuation of solid transport are related to ?uctuation intensi-\nties of ?ow. Free-surface instabilities do not seem to change the in?uence\nthat u??RMS have on the ?ow as shown Equation 5.15 and Figure 5.20.\n\nThe power spectral density of the signals of solid transport do not bring\nany new information and instead corroborate what have been already dis-\ncussed: for low Shields number, the ?1 decay of energy is noticed; for in-\ntermediary and strong Shields number, the ?5/3 decay takes place. Some\nspectral gap zones can sometimes be perceived (Singh et al., 2010), but since\nwe are not able to direct correlate them with ?ow velocity ?uctuations, it is\nnot possible to con?rm its origin. No evidence was found in the PSD that\n\n151\n\n\n\n11. Discussion and conclusions\n\nthe disturbance applied had direct in?uence on the solid discharge since no\npeak on waves frequency was observed. Such conclusion seems plausible as\nwe look into ?ow ?uctuation intensities: the e?ects of the disturbance on\nthe ?ow appear only close to the free surface away from particles trajecto-\nries (close to bottom). Then, no direct in?uence should be perceived.\n\n11.2 Mathematical models for free surface instabilities in\n\nmud?ows\n\n11.2.1 Acquabona test-case\n\nOne of the greatest issues in the geophysical scienti?c community is the\nde?nition of limits for characterization of di?erent mass movement phe-\nnomena (Hungr et al., 2001). As the citation used in the ?rst chapter of\nthis thesis shows, even the USGS (United States Geological Survey), one\nof the greatest institutions in this ?eld, does not de?ne so straightforward\nmass movement. The fundamental characteristic that di?erentiate mass\nmovements is the ratio water/solid sediment and their velocity propaga-\ntion. Such ratio for the Acquabona creek event (chapter 6) is not well\nde?ne by researchers that collected the samples. So, the proper and cor-\nrect de?nition of the event is compromised. Nevertheless, debris and mud\n?ows are not distant from a rheological point of view and then allowed this\nresearch to happen and to test the mathematical model. To quantify the\nturbulent dissipation contribution during the event would possibly increase\nthe uncertainties within the input parameters set to the model, rendering\nit less reliable.\n\nThe model used for Acquabona creek simulations has proven its useful-\nness when predicting mean wave properties. A relatively small discrepancy\nof 8% is found between predicted and mean value from measurements for\nwaves amplitudes. The origin of such discrepancy could be explained in\ndi?erent ways. One possible explanation could be the di?culty to precisely\nquantify the rheological properties of the ?owing material. The represen-\ntation of such complex mixture by a rheological model implies intrinsically\na limitation as rheology models average mixture behavior. As size of par-\nticles in ?uid matrix may vary from dust and clay (? 1 \u00b5m) to rock and\nboulders (? 1 m), their dynamics in ?uid matrix are completely averaged\ninto simpli?ed shearing laws. Even though, assuming the Herschel-Bulkley\nrheological model, we were able to evaluate the e?ect of ?uid rheological\n\n152\n\n\n\n11.2. Mathematical models for free surface instabilities in mud?ows\n\nparameters. Such matter was discussed in section 7.6 where variations of\nrheological properties led to a variation range of possible roll waves ampli-\ntudes of 30% for the Acquabona event.\n\n11.2.2 More complex model for non-Newtonian ?ows in natural\nenvironment\n\nOne of the possible reasons for the approximative results of roll waves model\nwhen compared to ?eld studies is that the model does not yet represent all\nthe complexity and variability of the natural environment which could mis-\nlead the results. Then, one approximation that could enhance the results\nis the assumption of a porous ?xed bed in the bottom of the channel. At\nthis time, ?uid is allowed to ?ow in between the voids present in the bed,\ncreated by the rocks and sediments. In this way, the ?ow would change and\npresent a bottom slip velocity. No bedforms are considered, so bed is ?at.\n\nIn this work it was presented a mathematical solution for velocity pro?le\nof laminar free surface ?ows of non-Newtonian ?uids presenting Herschel-\nBulkley rheology over a porous bed. Additional numerical simulation showed\nthat the mathematical solution is in agreement with the simulated one. A\ndiscrepancy is found between the boundary condition imposed in the math-\nematical model and numerical results, which leads to errors in the order of\n10% on the bottom velocity uB. The identi?cation of form factor ? still\nrests empirical as no consistent methodology is able to determine how prop-\nerly estimate such parameter.\n\nThe mathematical solution proves that general ?ow properties (h0 and\nu0) are a?ected by the bed. It is noticed that the index ?ow n is and im-\nportant parameter for proper estimation of the bottom slip velocity, and\nthis index ?ow can signi?cantly change ?ow dynamics close to the bottom.\nNevertheless, yield stress ?0 acts in a di?erent way reducing the overall in-\n?uence of bottom on the mean ?ow velocity. An interesting observation is\nthe e?ect of bottom velocity (non-zero due the presence of a porous ?ow)\nwith rheological parameters. The presence of such velocity at the interface\nbetween channel bottom and ?ow decreases proportionally the size of the\nsheared region, thus increasing the proportion of plug zone and the mean\n?ow velocity. This seems a rather typical behavior and in?uence of porous\nmedium walls to the general ?ow dynamics. However, the importance of\nporous bed decreases as ?uid become more and more non-Newtonian (in-\n\n153\n\n\n\n11. Discussion and conclusions\n\ncreasing yield or decreasing index ?ow). Such observation is rather direct,\nbut since the ?ow discharge is considered constant, some changes in the\n?ow height should be noticed when comparing the non-porous bed when\ndealing with open-channel ?ows.\n\nWhen using the new proposed model to establish the relation ?ow dis-\ncharge and ?ow height for the Acquabona test-case, we veri?ed that for a\nnatural environment, with a highly non-Newtonian ?uid ?ow, the poros-\nity does not have a signi?cant importance in terms of ?ow height predic-\ntion. Since the non-Newtonian parameters play a role much more important\nthan the porosity (when both are combined), engineering projects would be\nmuch more safe predicting with accurate values of the rheological param-\neters (thus decreasing their uncertainties) than considering the additional\ne?ect of porosity. What still rests unknown is how roll waves domain of\ngeneration would be altered. Following the literature (Pascal, 2006), we\nexpect that the domain of roll waves generation would increase, i.e. roll\nwaves would be capable to appear for lower Froude numbers. This might\nas well be an important factor for predicting the ?ow height, as it has been\nalready discussed during the thesis.\n\nFinally, all these observations should be veri?ed experimentally as they\nwould change, for example, the correct interpretation or prediction of ?ows\nby dimensionless number such as Reynolds and Froude numbers, which de-\npend on characteristic ?ow variables. More numerical simulation should\nalso be performed to better verify the boundary conditions employed in the\nmathematical problem. The comprehension of this kind of ?ow dynamics\nis crucial when dealing with industrial and civil structures dimensioning\nwhich relies upon such informations.\n\n154\n\n\n\nChapter 12\n\nPerspectives\n\nThis work gives some perspectives on how further investigations would help\nto understand the phenomena here studied and to improve the research on\nthe domain.\n\n12.1 Part I - Sediment transport in runo? ?ows\n\nFrom the experimental point of view, even though the method employed\nproved its e?ciency for studying sediment transport, further improvements\nshould be sought to improve quality of results and further data analysis.\n\n12.1.1 Technical improvements\n\nA PIV system coupled with the PTV and with higher acquisition rate (in\nthe same order of magnitude of the solid transport) would help further\ncross-correlation studies and to precisely detect how ?ow and sediment\nentrainment are related to each other. In this way, smaller scales might\nbe understood, and further explanation on ?uctuation of transport bet-\nter explained based on ?ow characteristics. Simultaneous measurements of\nfriction and transport would allow cross-correlation analysis and a better\ninderstaing on the validity of the transport law in timescale description.\n\nConcerning the solid discharge method, we think that di?erent image\nprocessing techniques might give di?erent results which would have to be\ntreated di?erently before the calculations ofn the information required. A\nparallel method was tested during this PhD and shown that quality of\n\n155\n\n\n\n12. Perspectives\n\nresults should depend on the quality of signal treatment (images), and not\nonly on the images themselves.\n\n12.1.2 Statistical analysis of particle counting events\n\nPTV method proved to be a reasonable method for calculating the solid\ndischarge ?simpler? methods might give the same results with less infor-\nmation. The data available from this work should have, for example, an\nstatistical exploration from the counting signals, ignoring particles mass and\nvelocities, in order to understand the dynamics of particles arrival events.\nPreliminary results were performed during this thesis and showed promising\nresults. The method could be employ using di?erent statistical approaches\n(following renewal or renewal-reward theories, for example) to explore dif-\nferent information from the signals.\n\n12.1.3 Mathematical model bottom shear stress on roll waves regime\n\nA proper mathematical approach of the e?ects of roll waves into the bottom\nshear in presence of a mobile bed seems still missing in the literature. The\ndevelopment of a simple formulation capable to describe how the friction\nchange depending on ?ow parameters and bed characteristics would be use-\nful to compare with the experimental results here presented. This project\nis already under development in the Brazilian research group RMVP where\nthis PhD candidate have been working.\n\n12.2 Part II - Non-Newtonian ?uid ?ows over natural\n\nenvironments\n\n12.2.1 Mathematical modeling and validation\n\nThe mathematical model employed in this work to study a natural event\nis yet to be completely reliable. It was shown that for the Acquabona test\ncase it has been able to give the order of magnitude of the problem. Toi\nguarantee its utility from an engineering perspective, others text cases have\nto be employed to satisfactorily prove its functionality. Mass movements\nevents all across the globe have been registered in the literature and must\nbe carefully explored to verify the robustness of the results given by the\nmathematical approach.\n\n156\n\n\n\n12.2. Part II - Non-Newtonian ?uid ?ows over natural environments\n\nTurbulent dissipation should be also inserted inside the stress tensor of\nthe mathematical system so its representativity range would increase. Not\nonly on the mathematical approach but also numerical and experimentally\nnon-Newtonian ?uids with turbulent dissipation should be explored. This\nwould assist the evaluation of the preponderant e?ects in a natural event\nlike the ones here studied.\n\n12.2.2 Non-Newtonian ?uid ?ow over porous medium\n\nIn this work, the analytical solution found for the velocity pro?le of a non-\nNewtonian ?uid ?ow over a porous medium was tested against some numer-\nical simulations where the ?uid and ?ow conditions (discharge and slope)\nwhere varied. However, the e?ect of the geometry was not tested, thus de-\nmanding further work.\n\nNumerical simulations would allow a better veri?cation of the bound-\nary condition adopted for the analytical model. Experimental runs on this\nwould also be an important work in this matter so the boundary condition\nfor yield ?uids ?owing over a porous bed could be completely validate or\ndiscarded, if so.\n\nThe next stage on the mathematical modeling would be insert the veloc-\nity pro?le into the shallow water equations for a Hershcel-Bulkley ?uid ?ow\nand obtain the roll waves equation for this problem. This would culminate\non a more complex model for roll waves and veri?cation of validity of waves\nparameters and domain of stability.\n\n157\n\n\n\n\n\nBibliography\n\nM. Agelinchaab and M. F.
