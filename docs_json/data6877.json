Este facto \u00e9 agravado pela invas\u00e3o globalizada de peixes alien\u00edgenas em lagos mais quentes, cujos efeitos sobre as interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas s\u00e3o praticamente desconhecidos. Com o intuito de diminuir o grau de incerteza associado \u00e0 ecologia destes sistemas em Portugal, foi estudada a ecologia do zoopl\u00e2ncton na Lagoa da Vela (Quiaios, Figueira da Foz), um lago natural pouco profundo e eutr\u00f3fico que apresenta domin\u00e2ncia de peixes alien\u00edgenas. O objectivo da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o foi compreender os mecanismos que moldam a comunidade zooplanct\u00f3nica, com particular enfoque nas suas interac\u00e7\u00f5es com os peixes planct\u00edvoros, dada a import\u00e2ncia deste elo tr\u00f3fico de charneira. Numa primeira fase, foram caracterizadas as comunidades de zoopl\u00e2ncton e peixes durante um ano. A lagoa revelou ser altamente produtiva e turva, exibindo n\u00edveis elevados de s\u00f3lidos em suspens\u00e3o, nutrientes e clorofila a. Foi observado um contraste evidente entre o per\u00edodo de \u00e1gua transparente, dominado por Daphnia, e o resto do ano, dominado por zooplanctontes de pequenas dimens\u00f5es, incapazes de controlar o crescimento algal. A press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria revelou ser uma for\u00e7a determinante do funcionamento da lagoa, a par com o n\u00edvel de part\u00edculas em suspens\u00e3o. Os peixes alien\u00edgenas exibiram um grau substancial de omnivoria, com o zoopl\u00e2ncton a constituir um dos principais componentes da dieta. A perca-sol (Lepomis gibbosus) foi o principal peixe planct\u00edvoro, exibindo popula\u00e7\u00f5es muito densas, sobretudo no Ver\u00e3o, como resultado de um recrutamento cont\u00ednuo de Julho a Setembro. A preda\u00e7\u00e3o exercida por perca-sol e outros planct\u00edvoros contribuiu para o colapso da popula\u00e7\u00e3o de Daphnia (e consequente redu\u00e7\u00e3o da transpar\u00eancia), mas o desaparecimento dos dafn\u00edideos durante o Ver\u00e3o e Outono n\u00e3o pode ser explicado sem recurso a outras vari\u00e1veis ambientais para al\u00e9m da preda\u00e7\u00e3o. A segunda fase do estudo pretendeu avaliar as estrat\u00e9gias utilizadas pelos zooplanctontes para minimizar a press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria a que est\u00e3o sujeitos. Na Lagoa da Vela, o zoopl\u00e2ncton exibiu uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o espacial heterog\u00e9nea (no plano horizontal e vertical) dependente da transpar\u00eancia da \u00e1gua. Os padr\u00f5es observados s\u00e3o consistentes com o evitamento de predadores visuais (i.e. peixes). A amplitude reduzida do ref\u00fagio no plano vertical e a aus\u00eancia de ref\u00fagio proporcionada pela vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o aqu\u00e1tica tornam os zooplanctontes (sobretudo Daphnia) particularmente suscept\u00edveis \u00e0 preda\u00e7\u00e3o. Em ambiente laboratorial, Daphnia reagiu a sinais qu\u00edmicos de duas esp\u00e9cies de peixes alien\u00edgenas presentes na lagoa atrav\u00e9s de incremento reprodutivo e redu\u00e7\u00e3o do tamanho corporal, evidenciando uma estrat\u00e9gia que maximiza o seu desempenho ante predadores selectivos, conforme documentado para outras esp\u00e9cies de peixes planct\u00edvoros.\nkeywords\tshallow lakes, freshwater zooplankton, freshwater fish, alien species, population ecology, trophic interactions, habitat selection, anti-predator defence, Daphnia\nabstract\tFew studies have focused on Mediterranean shallow lakes, although there is evidence of their distinctive features. This is particularly aggravated by the widespread invasion of alien fish predators in warmer lakes, whose effects on the trophic interactions largely remain unknown. To address the uncertainty associated with the ecology of these systems in Portugal, we studied the zooplankton ecology in a shallow polymictic lake (Lake Vela, Figueira da Foz), which is dominated by alien fish species and suffers from high nutrient loading (eutrophication). The purpose of the research was to understand the mechanisms shaping the zooplanktonic community, with particular emphasis on its interactions with planktivorous fish, given the importance of this pivotal trophic link. In a first stage, surveys on the zooplankton and fish assemblages were conducted for a one-year period. Lake Vela was highly productive and turbid, displaying high levels of suspended solids, nutrients and chlorophyll a. An evident contrast was observed between a clear water phase, dominated by Daphnia, and the rest of the year, dominated by small-sized zooplankters, unable to control algal biomass. Predatory pressure was found to be a key determinant of the lake's condition and function, along with the level of suspended particles. Alien fish displayed a substantial degree of omnivory, where zooplankton was a main component in the diet. Pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) was the main planktivore, attaining very dense populations, mostly in the summer, as a consequence of continuous recruitment from July to September. Predation exerted by pumpkinseed and other planktivores contributed to the population collapse of Daphnia (and consequent reduction in transparency), but the disappearance of the daphniids during summer and autumn cannot be explained unless environmental variables other than predation are considered. The second stage of this work intended to study how zooplankters cope with high predation pressure from the alien benthi-planktivorous fish. Zooplankton displayed a heterogeneous spatial distribution (both horizontal and vertically) in Lake Vela, which was directly dependent on transparency. The observed patterns were consistent with avoidance of visual predators (i.e. fish). The reduced amplitude of refuge in the vertical plane and the absence of refuge in aquatic vegetation make zooplankters particularly susceptible to predation. Under laboratorial environment, Daphnia responded to chemical cues from two alien fish species present in the lake by maximizing reproduction and reducing body size, as an anti-predator defence mechanism against size-selective predation, as reported for most fish taxa.\n\u00abDo que voc\u00ea precisa, acima de tudo, \u00e9 de se n\u00e3o lembrar do que eu lhe disse; nunca pense por mim, pense sempre por voc\u00ea; fique certo de que mais valem todos os erros se forem cometidos segundo o que pensou e decidiu do que todos os acertos, se eles forem meus, n\u00e3o seus.\u00bb\nAgostinho da Silva\nr\nIndice\nP\u00e1g.\nPre\u00e2mbulo\t3\nEnquadramento da disserta\u00e7\u00e3o\t5\nAs interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas como mecanismos reguladores\t5\nCascatas tr\u00f3ficas e biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o\t9\nO papel central de Daphnia\t13\nLagos pouco profundos vs. lagos profundos\t16\nOs lagos pouco profundos no contexto Mediterr\u00e2nico\t19\nObjectivos e estrutura da disserta\u00e7\u00e3o\t24\nRefer\u00eancias\t26\nCap\u00edtulo 1\nEcologia e din\u00e2mica sazonal do zoopl\u00e2ncton\nDin\u00e2mica sazonal dos crust\u00e1ceos zooplanct\u00f3nicos de um lago pouco profundo e eutr\u00f3fico da zona Mediterr\u00e2nica\t39\nResumo\t39\nPalavras-chave\t39\nSeasonal dynamics of the crustacean zooplankton of a shallow eutrophic lake from the Mediterranean region\t40\nAbstract\t40\nKeywords\t40\nIntroduction\t40\nMaterials and methods\t42\nResults\t46\nDiscussion\t58\nReferences\t62\nCap\u00edtulo 2\nRecrutamento e ecologia alimentar da ictiocenose\nCompreendendo o sucesso dos peixes alien\u00edgenas de um lago Ib\u00e9rico\npouco profundo: padr\u00f5es de recrutamento e ecologia alimentar\t67\nResumo\t67\nPalavras-chave\t67\nUnderstanding the success of alien fish in an Iberian shallow lake: recruitment patterns and feeding ecology\t68\nAbstract\t68\nKeywords\t68\nIntroduction\t68\nMaterials and methods\t70\nResults\t74\nDiscussion\t85\nReferences\t91\nCap\u00edtulo 3\nDin\u00e2mica sazonal da planctivoria na ictiocenose\nPlanctivoria em peixes alien\u00edgenas e implica\u00e7\u00f5es para as interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas de um lago Mediterr\u00e2nico pouco profundo\t97\nResumo\t97\nPalavras-chave\t97\nPlanktivory in non-indigenous fish and implications for trophic interactions in a Mediterranean shallow lake\t98\nAbstract\t98\nKeywords\t98\nIntroduction\t98\nMaterials and methods\t100\nResults\t102\nDiscussion\t111\nReferences\t115\nCap\u00edtulo 4\nSelec\u00e7\u00e3o de habitat em crust\u00e1ceos zooplanct\u00f3nicos\nSelec\u00e7\u00e3o de habitat e distribui\u00e7\u00e3o di\u00e1ria dos crust\u00e1ceos zooplanct\u00f3nicos de um lago Mediterr\u00e2nico pouco profundo, durante as fases de \u00e1gua turva e \u00e1gua transparente\t121\nResumo\t121\nPalavras-chave\t121\nHabitat selection and diel distribution of the crustacean zooplankton from a shallow Mediterranean lake during the turbid and clear water\nphases\t122\nAbstract\t122\nKeywords\t122\nIntroduction\t122\nMaterials and methods\t124\nResults\t127\nDiscussion\t134\nReferences\t138\nCap\u00edtulo 5\nRespostas populacionais de Daphnia a predadores\nRespostas populacionais de Daphnia longispina a sinais qu\u00edmicos exsudados por Gambusia holbrooki e Lepomis gibbosus\t143\nResumo\t143\nPalavras-chave\t143\nLife history responses of Daphnia longispina to mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus)\nkairomones\t144\nAbstract\t144\nKeywords\t144\nIntroduction\t144\nResults\n149\nDiscussion\n153\nReferences\n157\nConsidera\u00e7\u00f5es finais\nConsidera\u00e7\u00f5es finais\nRefer\u00eancias\n163\n167\nIntrodu\u00e7\u00e3o geral\nPRE\u00c2MBULO\nO fasc\u00ednio pelos lagos e rios, enquanto sistemas biol\u00f3gicos, e a preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o acerca da interfer\u00eancia antropog\u00e9nica sobre estes levaram ao surgimento de uma nova disciplina cient\u00edfica, no dealbar do s\u00e9culo XX. A Limnologia (ou \u201cOceanografia dos lagos\u201d) surgiu formalmente com o trabalho do su\u00ed\u00e7o Fran\u00e7ois-Alphonse Forel no Lago Genebra (Forel, 1882), publicado em tr\u00eas volumes entre 1882 e 1904. Do outro lado do Atl\u00e2ntico (EUA), o nascimento da Limnologia surgiu com os estudos de Edward Birge e Chancey Juday, que se dedicaram \u00e0 pesquisa do Lago Mendota (e outros lagos do Wisconsin). Poucos anos antes, contudo, o trabalho de Stephen Alfred Forbes - prestigiado ec\u00f3logo americano - ter\u00e1 estabelecido as funda\u00e7\u00f5es da ci\u00eancia dos ecossistemas aqu\u00e1ticos, bem presentes na sua influente publica\u00e7\u00e3o de 1887 (Forbes, 1887). O interesse crescente em torno da Limnologia originou o nascimento de prestigiadas sociedades cient\u00edficas na primeira metade do s\u00e9culo XX, como a Netherlands Society of Aquatic Ecology (fundada em 1921), a Societas Internationalis Limnologiae (SIL, fundada em 1922), a Freshwater Biological Association (fundada em 1929) ou a Limnological Society of America (fundada em 1936, dando origem em 1948 \u00e0 actual American Society of Limnology and Oceanography - ASLO).\nO p\u00f3s-guerra trouxe a Limnologia moderna, cujo pai, respons\u00e1vel pelos primeiros tratados sobre Limnologia (Hutchinson, 1957; 1967), foi George Evelyn Hutchinson. A Limnologia era agora definida como o estudo das rela\u00e7\u00f5es funcionais e da produtividade das comunidades de \u00e1gua doce (lagos, charcos, rios e ribeiras), reguladas pela din\u00e2mica dos factores do seu ambiente f\u00edsico, qu\u00edmico e biol\u00f3gico (Wetzel, 1983). Por defini\u00e7\u00e3o, o estudo da Limnologia abrange todos os habitats de \u00e1gua doce, incluindo charcos, lagos e albufeiras (habitats l\u00eanticos), bem como rios e ribeiras (habitats l\u00f3ticos), que diferem na aus\u00eancia (l\u00eantico) ou presen\u00e7a (l\u00f3tico) de um fluxo unidireccional significativo da massa de \u00e1gua. Contudo, historicamente, as obras e as sociedades cient\u00edficas de Limnologia (que deriva da palavra grega para lago, limnos) dedicaram a sua aten\u00e7\u00e3o quase exclusivamente aos sistemas l\u00eanticos. Esta divis\u00e3o hist\u00f3rica ainda hoje tem repercuss\u00f5es nas reuni\u00f5es e publica\u00e7\u00f5es cient\u00edficas da especialidade, dado o distinto contexto abi\u00f3tico e a diferente natureza das teias tr\u00f3ficas dos dois tipos de habitats.\nseguidores) surgiu a primeira sociedade para a dissemina\u00e7\u00e3o e debate do conhecimento cient\u00edfico sobre os recursos de \u00e1gua doce Ib\u00e9ricos, a Asociaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Limnolog\u00eda. A reduzida express\u00e3o dos habitats l\u00eanticos Ib\u00e9ricos, em compara\u00e7\u00e3o com os numerosos lagos das cadeias montanhosas do centro da Europa ou os vastos lagos da Am\u00e9rica do Norte, \u00e9 uma das explica\u00e7\u00f5es plaus\u00edveis para a menor express\u00e3o da Limnologia na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica. De facto, devido ao clima Mediterr\u00e2nico, que se faz sentir sobretudo no centro e sul da Ib\u00e9ria, os lagos naturais rareiam e os represamentos de rios (albufeiras) constituem os sistemas l\u00eanticos mais representativos (Colomer, 1996; Boavida &amp; Marques, 1996; Boavida &amp; Gliwicz, 1996; Velasco et al., 1999; Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Boavida, 2000; Caramujo &amp; Boavida, 2000b). A fraca implementa\u00e7\u00e3o hist\u00f3rica da Limnologia na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica (Casado &amp; Montes, 1992) causou alguma descontinuidade nos registos limnol\u00f3gicos, sendo raros os casos de lagos na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica com registos hist\u00f3ricos mais ou menos cont\u00ednuos das suas componentes abi\u00f3ticas e bi\u00f3ticas (e.g. Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Romo et al., 2005), ao contr\u00e1rio do que se passa em muitos pa\u00edses onde a Limnologia adquiriu maior express\u00e3o (e.g. Perrow et al., 1994; Moss et al., 1996; Breukers et al., 1997; Benndorf et al., 2000; Carpenter et al., 2001; Hrb\u00e1cek et al., 2003; Horn, 2003). Esta falta de dados hist\u00f3ricos de base \u00e9 particularmente not\u00f3ria em Portugal, o que dificulta a compreens\u00e3o das consequ\u00eancias da interfer\u00eancia antropog\u00e9nica sobre os sistemas aqu\u00e1ticos.\nFoi no sentido de colmatar algumas das car\u00eancias da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o limnol\u00f3gica em Portugal, sobretudo na ecologia dos lagos pouco profundos, que surgiu a presente disserta\u00e7\u00e3o. Estas car\u00eancias adquirem particular import\u00e2ncia em virtude do agudizar da crise dos recursos de \u00e1gua doce, resultante do aumento do consumo e da degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade de um bem j\u00e1 de si escasso (Wetzel, 1983; Boavida, 2000). A escassez dos recursos de \u00e1gua doce, mas tamb\u00e9m as amea\u00e7as que pairam sobre a sua integridade ecol\u00f3gica e biodiversidade, refor\u00e7aram a necessidade de um conhecimento mais profundo sobre estes sistemas. S\u00f3 o incremento do conhecimento cient\u00edfico acerca dos habitats dul\u00e7aqu\u00edcolas (com estudos de natureza fundamental ou aplicada) poder\u00e1 proporcionar uma base sustentada e fundamentada para o desenvolvimento de ferramentas de monitoriza\u00e7\u00e3o mais adequadas, medidas de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o mais eficazes, e uma maior consciencializa\u00e7\u00e3o das popula\u00e7\u00f5es e dos gestores ambientais para os problemas que enfrentamos.\nENQUADRAMENTO DA DISSERTA\u00c7\u00c3O\nAs interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas como mecanismos reguladores\nA primeira aproxima\u00e7\u00e3o da Limnologia \u00e0s comunidades dos lagos foi hol\u00edstica e multidisciplinar, dando grande \u00eanfase aos processos f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicos enquanto modeladores das biocenoses. A categoriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos lagos em fun\u00e7\u00e3o da disponibilidade de nutrientes (estado tr\u00f3fico), por exemplo, rapidamente se tornou um paradigma (Vollenweider, 1976; Carlson, 1977; Williamson et al., 1999), especialmente porque adquiriu suporte nas evid\u00eancias emp\u00edricas de uma forte rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre a clorofila a e o f\u00f3sforo (Vollenweider, 1976; Schindler, 1978). Progressivamente, contudo, a tend\u00eancia para sobrevalorizar as condicionantes abi\u00f3ticas externas (clima, nutrientes, hidrologia) sobre os ecossistemas foi encontrando crescente oposi\u00e7\u00e3o na Ecologia. Os trabalhos pioneiros de alguns ec\u00f3logos (Hrb\u00e1cek et al., 1961; Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965; Hurlbert et al., 1972) demonstraram a import\u00e2ncia das interac\u00e7\u00f5es ecol\u00f3gicas internas (no caso, a preda\u00e7\u00e3o) no funcionamento dos sistemas aqu\u00e1ticos (ver mais adiante). Um novo paradigma, relativo ao papel determinante das interac\u00e7\u00f5es bi\u00f3ticas (competi\u00e7\u00e3o, reciclagem de nutrientes e, sobretudo, preda\u00e7\u00e3o) na din\u00e2mica das comunidades biol\u00f3gicas, instalava-se assim na Ecologia (Paine, 1980; Bronmark &amp; Hansson, 1998; Carpenter, 1998). Hoje em dia, \u00e9 comummente aceite que a regula\u00e7\u00e3o dos sistemas aqu\u00e1ticos assenta numa combina\u00e7\u00e3o/interac\u00e7\u00e3o das condicionantes externas (factores abi\u00f3ticos) e dos processos internos (interac\u00e7\u00f5es bi\u00f3ticas).\nA no\u00e7\u00e3o de que os predadores podem ter efeitos determinantes nos n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos inferiores (Hrb\u00e1cek et al., 1961; Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965; Hurlbert et al., 1972; Hall et al., 1976; Mills &amp; Forney, 1983) levou a que os mecanismos de regula\u00e7\u00e3o top-down (do topo da cadeia tr\u00f3fica para a sua base) fossem olhados com outra import\u00e2ncia na Ecologia das \u00e1guas doces (Carpenter et al., 1985). Estes mecanismos surgem por oposi\u00e7\u00e3o aos mecanismos bottom-up (McQueen et al., 1986), que resultam da competi\u00e7\u00e3o pelos recursos dispon\u00edveis (disponibilidade de nutrientes ou alimento). Do compromisso entre estes mecanismos reguladores resulta o equil\u00edbrio ecol\u00f3gico da teia tr\u00f3fica de um lago (Wetzel, 1983; Bronmark &amp; Hansson, 1998). Um exemplo ilustrativo da interac\u00e7\u00e3o dos mecanismos reguladores das teias tr\u00f3ficas do habitat lacustre \u00e9 a din\u00e2mica sazonal do pl\u00e2ncton, cujo modelo de sucess\u00e3o para lagos temperados (Sommer et al., 1986) foi descrito por um grupo internacional de peritos (PEG - Plankton Ecology Group), assumindo que os eventos que regulam a sucess\u00e3o do pl\u00e2ncton n\u00e3o ocorrem ao acaso e obedecem a uma sazonalidade\nPlanctivoro vertebrado\nNutrientes (N, P, Si, ...)\nPlanct\u00edvoro invertebrado\nZoopl\u00e2ncton grande\nZoopl\u00e2ncton pequeno\nFitopl\u00e2ncton\nNano-fitopl\u00e2ncton\nFigura 1 \u2022 Modelo conceptual simplificado de uma teia tr\u00f3fica pel\u00e1gica de um lago t\u00edpico (baseado em Carpenter et al., 1985; Bronmark &amp; Hansson, 1998). A espessura das setas representa a intensidade da interac\u00e7\u00e3o e as setas a tracejado correspondem \u00e0 reciclagem de nutrientes. As ilustra\u00e7\u00f5es a preto e branco s\u00e3o da autoria de Sara Antunes, excepto as relativas ao fitopl\u00e2ncton, que foram obtidas no site educacional Biodidac (Biodidac - A bank of digital resources for teaching biology, http://biodidac.bio.uottawa.ca).\nDevido \u00e0 sua posi\u00e7\u00e3o-chave na teia tr\u00f3fica pel\u00e1gica (Figura 1), a din\u00e2mica sazonal do pl\u00e2ncton resulta de um conjunto de interac\u00e7\u00f5es entre processos bi\u00f3ticos (competi\u00e7\u00e3o\npelos recursos e preda\u00e7\u00e3o) e condicionantes abi\u00f3ticas (disponibilidade de nutrientes, temperatura), conforme ilustrado na Caixa A. O modelo PEG prev\u00ea que, devido \u00e0s baixas temperaturas de Inverno e ao curto per\u00edodo diurno, o crescimento fitoplanct\u00f3nico seja reduzido, permitindo a acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes. Esta escassez de alimento compromete a fecundidade do zoopl\u00e2ncton e muitos recorrem a estrat\u00e9gias de diapausa, produzindo estruturas de dorm\u00eancia (Gilbert, 1974; Dahms, 1995; Hairston, 1996; Fryer, 1996). \u00c0 medida que o Inverno chega ao fim, o incremento da intensidade luminosa, combinado com a disponibilidade de nutrientes, permite o crescimento ilimitado do fitopl\u00e2ncton. Tem in\u00edcio a fase mais prof\u00edcua do pl\u00e2ncton (Primavera), com o desenvolvimento de pequenas algas de crescimento r\u00e1pido, que s\u00e3o alvo da herbivoria de esp\u00e9cies zooplanct\u00f3nicas com tempos de gera\u00e7\u00e3o curtos. Mais tarde, d\u00e1-se o aparecimento de esp\u00e9cies zooplanct\u00f3nicas de crescimento mais lento e maior biomassa, como \u00e9 o caso de Daphnia (vide Asaeda &amp; Acharya, 2000). Estes zooplanctontes de grandes dimens\u00f5es s\u00e3o capazes de uma herbivoria muito eficiente, podendo reduzir a biomassa algal a n\u00edveis muito baixos (Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965; Gliwicz, 1990; Scheffer, 1999), originando um per\u00edodo de \u00e1gua transparente (de dura\u00e7\u00e3o vari\u00e1vel) (Lampert et al., 1986). A vantagem competitiva de Daphnia (Gliwicz, 1990; Kreutzer &amp; Lampert, 1999) sobre as esp\u00e9cies de clad\u00f3ceros mais pequenas origina a exclus\u00e3o competitiva destas \u00faltimas (Vanni, 1986). Os nutrientes s\u00e3o reciclados pela herbivoria e acumulam-se na \u00e1gua.\nNo final da Primavera, a supress\u00e3o do crescimento do fitopl\u00e2ncton pelos herb\u00edvoros origina um decl\u00ednio das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de Daphnia por escassez de alimento (Luecke et al., 1990; H\u00fclsmann &amp; Weiler, 2000). Nesta altura, o papel da preda\u00e7\u00e3o no decl\u00ednio das popula\u00e7\u00f5es zooplanct\u00f3nicas \u00e9 residual (Luecke et al., 1990; Boersma et al., 1996; H\u00fclsmann &amp; Weiler, 2000), mas ap\u00f3s o colapso, \u00e9 a press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria que mant\u00e9m a abund\u00e2ncia de herb\u00edvoros de grandes dimens\u00f5es (sobretudo Daphnia) a n\u00edveis baixos, ao longo de todo o Ver\u00e3o (Mills &amp; Forney, 1983; Luecke et al., 1990; Boersma et al., 1996; Saunders et al., 1999). Este controlo \u00e9 particularmente forte na presen\u00e7a de estados larvares e juvenis de peixes (Boersma et al., 1996; Romare et al., 1999). \u00c9 reconhecido que esta regula\u00e7\u00e3o dos peixes planct\u00edvoros sobre o zoopl\u00e2ncton depende muito da din\u00e2mica populacional, quer de Daphnia (H\u00fclsmann &amp; Voigt, 2002; H\u00fclsmann, 2003), quer dos peixes (Mills &amp; Forney, 1983), podendo por isso produzir varia\u00e7\u00f5es interanuais no mesmo\nsistema aqu\u00e1tico (Mills &amp; Forney, 1983; Saunders et al., 1999; H\u00fclsmann, 2003) e varia\u00e7\u00f5es entre diferentes sistemas (e.g. Sommer et al., 1986; Saunders et al., 1999).\nO controlo exercido pelos peixes planct\u00edvoros sobre o zoopl\u00e2ncton origina uma mudan\u00e7a para uma comunidade zooplanct\u00f3nica dominada por esp\u00e9cies de pequenas dimens\u00f5es (Bosmina, Chydorus, cop\u00e9podes ciclop\u00f3ides e rot\u00edferos), menos eficientes no controlo da biomassa algal (Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965; Declerck et al., 1997; Tessier et al.,\n2001). Por esse motivo, o Ver\u00e3o \u00e9 caracterizado por uma diversifica\u00e7\u00e3o e crescimento da comunidade fitoplanct\u00f3nica e a uma forte redu\u00e7\u00e3o da transpar\u00eancia. Entretanto, o crescimento descontrolado do fitopl\u00e2ncton leva ao esgotamento progressivo dos nutrientes necess\u00e1rios ao seu crescimento (f\u00f3sforo, s\u00edlica, azoto), promovendo uma intensa competi\u00e7\u00e3o entre as esp\u00e9cies fitoplanct\u00f3nicas. Nalguns lagos, este fen\u00f3meno \u00e9 agravado pela estratifica\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica (vide Wetzel, 1983), que isola os nutrientes da parte mais funda do lago (abaixo da termoclina, hypolimnion), tornando-os indispon\u00edveis para a comunidade fitoplanct\u00f3nica (situada no epilimnion). Estas condi\u00e7\u00f5es originam o aparecimento de uma comunidade fitoplanct\u00f3nica de baixo valor nutritivo para o zoopl\u00e2ncton (Wetzel, 1983; Wilson et al., 2006), incluindo algumas cianobact\u00e9rias causadoras de floresc\u00eancias (blooms) A domin\u00e2ncia de cianobact\u00e9rias (algumas delas t\u00f3xicas) que ocorre no fitopl\u00e2ncton de muitos lagos eutr\u00f3ficos no Ver\u00e3o \u00e9 um factor que tamb\u00e9m pode contribuir para a supress\u00e3o de Daphnia durante este per\u00edodo (DeMott et al., 2001; Wilson et al.,\n2006), a par com a intensa press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria.\nCom a chegada do Outono, o lago sofre altera\u00e7\u00f5es f\u00edsico-qu\u00edmicas resultantes do t\u00e9rmino da termoclina. Este acontecimento permite a remistura das \u00e1guas (entre epilimnion e hypolimnion), o que origina um reabastecimento do stock de nutrientes e novo incremento de produ\u00e7\u00e3o fitoplanct\u00f3nica (sobretudo diatom\u00e1ceas). O re-estabelecimento de recursos de boa qualidade e a redu\u00e7\u00e3o da preda\u00e7\u00e3o, como consequ\u00eancia do abaixamento da temperatura, levam ao ressurgimento de um novo m\u00e1ximo nas abund\u00e2ncias zooplanct\u00f3nicas (Sommer et al., 1986), que normalmente inclui formas de grandes dimens\u00f5es como Daphnia.\nCaixa A - O modelo sucessional do pl\u00e2ncton\nDevido \u00e0 sua posi\u00e7\u00e3o-chave na teia tr\u00f3fica pel\u00e1gica, a din\u00e2mica sazonal do pl\u00e2ncton resulta de um conjunto de interac\u00e7\u00f5es entre processos bi\u00f3ticos (competi\u00e7\u00e3o pelos recursos e preda\u00e7\u00e3o) e condicionantes abi\u00f3ticas (luz, temperatura), conforme ilustrado na figura abaixo (baseado em Sommer et al., 1986; Bronmark &amp; Hansson, 1998; Saunders et al., 1999).\nApesar de v\u00e1rios lagos temperados se adequarem ao modelo proposto pelo PEG, outros h\u00e1 que registam varia\u00e7\u00f5es e excep\u00e7\u00f5es, mas isso n\u00e3o retira o valor a este modelo enquanto tentativa de estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o e de generaliza\u00e7\u00e3o de um padr\u00e3o sazonal (Sommer et al., 1986; Bronmark &amp; Hansson, 1998). Ali\u00e1s, a sua real utilidade \u00e9 a de permitir avaliar a for\u00e7a relativa dos factores determinantes dos padr\u00f5es de sucess\u00e3o planct\u00f3nica. Isso permite, por meio de an\u00e1lise comparativa, determinar quais os factores respons\u00e1veis pelos desvios ao modelo, ou levantar hip\u00f3teses que possam ser testadas em ambiente controlado ou semi-controlado.\n\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0<\nCascatas tr\u00f3ficas e biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o\nOs trabalhos pioneiros de Hrb\u00e1cek et al. (1961), Brooks &amp; Dodson (1965) e tamb\u00e9m de Hurlbert et al. (1972) ilustraram o contraste entre os sistemas com marcada domin\u00e2ncia de peixes planct\u00edvoros e os sistemas com reduzido stock de peixes. Os primeiros exibiam comunidades zooplanct\u00f3nicas desprovidas de Daphnia e cop\u00e9podes calan\u00f3ides, a par de elevada turbidez e biomassa fitoplanct\u00f3nica; pelo contr\u00e1rio, os \u00faltimos apresentavam elevadas densidades de Daphnia e um grau de transpar\u00eancia acrescida. Estas evid\u00eancias originaram uma hip\u00f3tese cient\u00edfica (size-efficiency hypothesis'), proposta por Brooks &amp; Dodson (1965), que envolve o mecanismo de regula\u00e7\u00e3o dos n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos de\nbase pelos peixes planct\u00edvoros e pisc\u00edvoros, e que tamb\u00e9m est\u00e1 na base de alguns eventos do modelo sucessional do pl\u00e2ncton (ver acima; Sommer et al., 1986). Esta hip\u00f3tese baseia-se na interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre duas estrat\u00e9gias diferentes: a dos peixes, como selectores de alimento (preferindo por isso presas de maiores dimens\u00f5es), e a dos zooplanctontes como colectores generalistas de alimento (Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965). De forma a tornar mais clara esta rela\u00e7\u00e3o, tomemos ent\u00e3o como ponto de partida a teia tr\u00f3fica simplificada de um lago (Figura 1), que tem por base os nutrientes limitantes ao crescimento dos produtores pel\u00e1gicos (fitopl\u00e2ncton - representa o primeiro n\u00edvel tr\u00f3fico). Os herb\u00edvoros (zoopl\u00e2ncton), planct\u00edvoros (macroinvertebrados planct\u00f3nicos e peixes) e os pisc\u00edvoros (peixes) constituem os n\u00edveis seguintes. O modelo contempla apenas os grupos funcionais do compartimento pel\u00e1gico, dado ser a\u00ed que decorre a maior frac\u00e7\u00e3o de produtividade de um lago t\u00edpico (Hutchinson, 1967; Wetzel, 1983). O diagrama apresentado \u00e9 meramente indicativo das interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas mais fortes, n\u00e3o pretendendo abarcar a totalidade da reticulada teia tr\u00f3fica, que pode incluir componentes b\u00eanticas (Bronmark &amp; Hansson,\n1998).\nDa interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o do modelo conceptual (Figura 1), \u00e9 poss\u00edvel inferir que um incremento na abund\u00e2ncia dos pisc\u00edvoros produzir\u00e1 um decr\u00e9scimo na abund\u00e2ncia dos peixes planct\u00edvoros, resultando numa maior import\u00e2ncia dos planct\u00edvoros invertebrados (como o d\u00edptero planct\u00f3nico Chaoborus, na figura) e num incremento na densidade dos zooplanctontes de grandes dimens\u00f5es (mormente Daphnia) Se a preda\u00e7\u00e3o por parte dos peixes planct\u00edvoros for reduzida o suficiente, Daphnia predominar\u00e1 sobre as esp\u00e9cies de zooplanctontes mais pequenas, dada a sua superioridade enquanto competidor (Hall et al., 1976; Gliwicz, 1990; Kreutzer &amp; Lampert, 1999) em regimes de reduzida preda\u00e7\u00e3o (sizeefficiency hypothesis; Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965). A presen\u00e7a abundante de Daphnia promove a redu\u00e7\u00e3o da biomassa fitoplanct\u00f3nica (ver mais adiante). O cen\u00e1rio oposto ser\u00e1 esperado como consequ\u00eancia de uma redu\u00e7\u00e3o na abund\u00e2ncia de pisc\u00edvoros, j\u00e1 que tal far\u00e1 aumentar a abund\u00e2ncia dos peixes planct\u00edvoros, que exercer\u00e3o forte press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria sobre o zoopl\u00e2ncton, particularmente Daphnia (size-selective predation; Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965; Hall et al., 1976; Gliwicz, 1994), o que promover\u00e1 o incremento da produ\u00e7\u00e3o fitoplanct\u00f3nica.\nExistem actualmente numerosas evid\u00eancias que corroboram o racioc\u00ednio e as infer\u00eancias do modelo conceptual da Figura 1. Algumas destas observa\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o\n1O\nprovenientes de estudos onde se acompanhou a din\u00e2mica do sistema a longo prazo, a par com a evolu\u00e7\u00e3o da ictiocenose (Breukers et al., 1997; Hrb\u00e1cek et al., 2003; Horn, 2003). Estes trabalhos demonstraram que o aumento progressivo do stock pisc\u00edcola reduziu a biomassa do zoopl\u00e2ncton e a transpar\u00eancia, ao mesmo tempo que a produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria aumentava (eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o). O efeito mais pronunciado foi a redu\u00e7\u00e3o da biomassa das esp\u00e9cies zooplanct\u00f3nicas de maiores dimens\u00f5es (sobretudo Daphnia) e/ou a sua menor express\u00e3o temporal. Num destes casos (Breukers et al., 1997), a esp\u00e9cie dominante Daphnia pulex foi mesmo suprimida e o seu lugar foi tomado por dafn\u00eddeos de menor dimens\u00e3o (D. cucullata, D. galeata e os seus h\u00edbridos inter-espec\u00edficos). Em dois destes casos (Breukers et al., 1997; Hrb\u00e1cek et al., 2003), o incremento a longo prazo da clorofila a n\u00e3o teve correspond\u00eancia no f\u00f3sforo total, demonstrando claramente a cascata do topo (peixes planct\u00edvoros) para a base da teia tr\u00f3fica. Os efeitos contr\u00e1rios foram relatados em sistemas onde ocorreram eventos ocasionais de mortandade de peixes planct\u00edvoros, o que originou um incremento da biomassa zooplanct\u00f3nica e consequente redu\u00e7\u00e3o da turbidez e da produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria, quando comparados com o estado pr\u00e9vio do sistema (Perrow et al., 1994; Jeppesen et al., 2000; Margaritora et al., 2001; Nagdali &amp; Gupta, 2002; Abrantes et al., 2006a) ou com sistemas adjacentes onde n\u00e3o ocorreu a mortandade (Jeppesen et al., 2000; Korponai et al., 2003). Refira-se que, em dois dos casos aqui apresentados (Nagdali &amp; Gupta, 2002; Abrantes et al., 2006a), o efeito foi transit\u00f3rio.\nAo conjunto de efeitos rec\u00edprocos do predador sobre a presa que alteram a abund\u00e2ncia, biomassa ou produtividade de uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o, comunidade ou n\u00edvel tr\u00f3fico, repercutindo-se atrav\u00e9s de mais do que um elo da teia tr\u00f3fica (Pace et al., 1999), denominou-se cascata tr\u00f3fica (Paine, 1980). Carpenter et al. (1985) foram pioneiros em dar destaque \u00e0s cascatas tr\u00f3ficas em Ecologia Aqu\u00e1tica, sugerindo que as interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas em cascata poderiam explicar a frac\u00e7\u00e3o da vari\u00e2ncia n\u00e3o explicada pela regress\u00e3o entre a produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria e o f\u00f3sforo (ver acima), sobretudo quando se trata de justificar as diferen\u00e7as de produtividade entre sistemas com n\u00edveis de nutrientes semelhantes mas com estruturas de teia tr\u00f3fica diferentes.\nPara al\u00e9m dos exemplos emp\u00edricos acima mencionados, a grande maioria de exemplos de cascatas tr\u00f3ficas deriva de experi\u00eancias de manipula\u00e7\u00e3o do stock pisc\u00edcola sob condi\u00e7\u00f5es controladas ou semi-controladas (e.g. Christofferson et al., 1993; Kurmayer &amp; Wanzenbock, 1996; Romare et al., 1999; Annadotter et al., 1999; Karjalainen et al., 1999;\nCarpenter et al., 2001; Lathrop et al., 2002; Williams &amp; Moss, 2003; T\u00e1trai et al., 2003a; 2003b; Schrage &amp; Downing, 2004). Estas experi\u00eancias vieram claramente corroborar a size-efficiency hypothesis de Brooks &amp; Dodson (1965), confirmando que os peixes planct\u00edvoros t\u00eam um papel determinante na transpar\u00eancia e produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria, via zoopl\u00e2ncton. Contudo, h\u00e1 que ressalvar que estes efeitos t\u00eam magnitudes diferentes consoante a densidade e os h\u00e1bitos das esp\u00e9cies planct\u00edvoras manipuladas (Karjalainen et al., 1999; Williams &amp; Moss, 2003; T\u00e1trai et al., 2003a).\nCom as evid\u00eancias acumuladas das interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas em cascata, cedo foi reconhecido o potencial da biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o das teias tr\u00f3ficas no controlo da biomassa e produtividade fitoplanct\u00f3nica, em programas de gest\u00e3o e recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de lagos (Shapiro &amp; Wright, 1984; Carpenter et al., 1985). De facto, tem sido demonstrada a utilidade da biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o como ferramenta \u00fatil para o controlo da eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o (e.g. Moss et al., 1996; Annadotter et al., 1999; Carpenter et al., 2001; Lathrop et al., 2002), muitas vezes em complementaridade com outras ferramentas, como a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da carga de nutrientes do meio (Clasen et al., 1989). No entanto, o sucesso da biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o depende de v\u00e1rios factores, entre eles a carga de nutrientes (sobretudo f\u00f3sforo) do sistema, a profundidade e a ictiocenose (Moss, 1992; Moss et al., 1996; Jeppesen et al., 2005). Alguns casos de sucesso de biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o podem ser encontrados na literatura, incluindo a remo\u00e7\u00e3o total ou parcial de peixes planct\u00edvoros (Moss et al., 1996; Annadotter et al., 1999; T\u00e1trai et al., 2003b; Schrage &amp; Downing, 2004) ou o aumento da densidade de pisc\u00edvoros (Carpenter et al., 2001; Lathrop et al., 2002; Skov et al., 2002). Por vezes, as interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas em cascata permitem a manuten\u00e7\u00e3o de um estado de \u00e1gua transparente, com reduzida produ\u00e7\u00e3o prim\u00e1ria e presen\u00e7a de Daphnia, mesmo sob elevada carga de f\u00f3sforo interna (Perrow et al., 1994). Contudo, o sucesso da biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 ainda incerto, dada a complexidade das interac\u00e7\u00f5es existentes no ecossistema lacustre (Moss, 1992). Em alguns trabalhos, por exemplo, foram relatados sucessos apenas tempor\u00e1rios, com o r\u00e1pido regresso \u00e0s condi\u00e7\u00f5es iniciais ap\u00f3s a biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o (Romo et al., 1996; Schrage &amp; Downing, 2004) ou com resultados parcialmente insatisfat\u00f3rios (Moss et al., 1996; Benndorf et al., 2000; T\u00e1trai et al., 2003b). \u00c9 necess\u00e1rio, por isso, um conhecimento mais profundo das interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas em cada caso particular e dos mecanismos de resist\u00eancia (histerese, ver mais adiante) do sistema (Jeppesen et al., 2005), j\u00e1 que estes determinam o sucesso ou insucesso da biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o.\nO papel central de Daphnia\nAs evid\u00eancias at\u00e9 aqui demonstradas e a argumenta\u00e7\u00e3o que tem vindo a ser seguida culminam com a ideia de que o zoopl\u00e2ncton \u00e9 o grupo chave no controlo da produ\u00e7\u00e3o fitoplanct\u00f3nica, na maioria dos lagos. S\u00e3o v\u00e1rios os autores (e.g. Lampert et al., 1986; Scheffer, 1998; Jeppesen et al., 1999; Scheffer, 1999) que concordam com esta ideia e os pr\u00f3prios princ\u00edpios subjacentes \u00e0 biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o e recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de lagos assentam no fomento indirecto da herbivoria (ver acima). A import\u00e2ncia do zoopl\u00e2ncton reside igualmente no seu papel central na transfer\u00eancia de massa e energia ao longo da teia tr\u00f3fica pel\u00e1gica e, numa perspectiva mais aplicada, no seu potencial enquanto indicador do estado tr\u00f3fico (Caramujo &amp; Boavida, 2000b) e da qualidade da \u00e1gua (Colomer, 1996) de reservat\u00f3rios para uso humano. Contudo, o controlo efectivo do fitopl\u00e2ncton (e consequente incremento da transpar\u00eancia) s\u00f3 \u00e9 poss\u00edvel com a presen\u00e7a de clad\u00f3ceros de grandes dimens\u00f5es (Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965; Pace, 1984), nomeadamente Daphnia (Figura 2). Inclusivamente, o maior ou menor impacto sobre a biomassa algal est\u00e1 mais relacionado com a presen\u00e7a de Daphnia, do que com a abund\u00e2ncia total do zoopl\u00e2ncton (Pace, 1984; McQueen et al., 1986; Scheffer, 1999). Isto deve-se, em parte, \u00e0 capacidade destes microinvertebrados em explorar um leque mais amplo de c\u00e9lulas algais (em termos de dimens\u00f5es), comparativamente \u00e0s esp\u00e9cies zooplanct\u00f3nicas mais pequenas (Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965; Tessier et al., 2001). N\u00e3o obstante essa caracter\u00edstica, o maior impacto de Daphnia sobre o fitopl\u00e2ncton resulta da sua efici\u00eancia enquanto filtrador, sendo capaz de reduzir a biomassa algal a n\u00edveis extremamente reduzidos, dada a sua toler\u00e2ncia para baixos n\u00edveis de alimento (Gliwicz, 1990; Kreutzer &amp; Lampert, 1999). Esta toler\u00e2ncia (ergo a efici\u00eancia de filtra\u00e7\u00e3o) \u00e9 tanto maior quanto maior o tamanho corporal (Gliwicz, 1990; Declerck et al., 1997; Kreutzer &amp; Lampert, 1999), pelo que as esp\u00e9cies de maiores dimens\u00f5es t\u00eam um potencial de filtra\u00e7\u00e3o e um impacto mais forte na clorofila a e na transpar\u00eancia da \u00e1gua (Kasprzak et al., 1999; Tessier et al., 2001).\nApesar da sua competitividade, os per\u00edodos de domin\u00e2ncia de Daphnia em lagos s\u00e3o limitados na din\u00e2mica sazonal do zoopl\u00e2ncton de lagos (vide modelo PEG). Dentre os factores que contribuem para o menor desempenho de Daphnia durante alguns per\u00edodos do ano, destaca-se a fraca qualidade do alimento (reduzida digestibilidade, defici\u00eancia nutritiva, produ\u00e7\u00e3o de toxinas, interfer\u00eancia mec\u00e2nica), que tem sido alvo de bastante aten\u00e7\u00e3o na literatura (e.g. Vanni &amp; Lampert, 1992; Brett, 1993; Kilham et al., 1997; Repka,\n\n1997; DeMott et al., 2001; Becker &amp; Boersma, 2003; L\u00fcrling, 2003; Wilson et al., 2006). Contudo, o factor preponderante no controlo das popula\u00e7\u00f5es de Daphnia \u00e9 a preda\u00e7\u00e3o, na medida em que estas representam itens alimentares de grande import\u00e2ncia para os peixes planct\u00edvoros (vide Roseman et al., 1996; Gliwicz et al., 2000; 2004; Scheuerell et al., 2005). Tessier &amp; Woodruff (2002a) reconheceram o papel determinante da planctivoria na composi\u00e7\u00e3o do fito- e zoopl\u00e2ncton, propondo uma categoriza\u00e7\u00e3o dos lagos em fun\u00e7\u00e3o do n\u00edvel de planctivoria, intimamente relacionada com a comunidade de herb\u00edvoros (mormente Daphnia). De facto, os v\u00e1rios exemplos de cascatas tr\u00f3ficas acima ilustrados documentam o sucesso de Daphnia em regimes de reduzida preda\u00e7\u00e3o, por oposi\u00e7\u00e3o aos sistemas onde a press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria \u00e9 elevada. N\u00e3o obstante, a coexist\u00eancia entre Daphnia e elevadas densidades de peixes planct\u00edvoros ocorre na natureza, em parte devido a mecanismos de defesa que permitem \u00e0s popula\u00e7\u00f5es de Daphnia contrabalan\u00e7ar, at\u00e9 um certo n\u00edvel, as perdas causadas pelos predadores.\nFigura 2 \u2022 Fotos de Daphnia longispina (O.F. M\u00fcller, 1776). Estes crust\u00e1ceos pertencem a um grupo de organismos (clad\u00f3ceros1) que, tipicamente, possui uma carapa\u00e7a cuticular bivalve que envolve o corpo mas n\u00e3o a cabe\u00e7a e que utiliza o seu 2\u00b0 par de antenas como principal \u00f3rg\u00e3o de locomo\u00e7\u00e3o. \u00c0 esquerda, f\u00eamea carregando embri\u00f5es partenogen\u00e9ticos (assexuados) na c\u00e2mara de incuba\u00e7\u00e3o; \u00e0 direita, f\u00eamea carregando ovos de resist\u00eancia, resultantes de reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o sexuada, envoltos em c\u00e1psula protectora (ephippium).\n1 O termo Cladocera tem sido historicamente utilizado para designar um grupo de crust\u00e1ceos dentro da classe Branchiopoda (os organismos desta classe caracterizam-se por possu\u00edrem ap\u00eandices tor\u00e1cicos em forma de folha, que constituem a sua principal superf\u00edcie respirat\u00f3ria). A revis\u00e3o feita \u00e0 classifica\u00e7\u00e3o dos Branchiopoda (Fryer, 1987) rompeu com o termo e substituiu a ordem Cladocera por 4 novas ordens (Haplopoda, Ctenopoda, Anomopoda, Onychopoda), por considerar os clad\u00f3ceros um grupo polifil\u00e9tico. O g\u00e9nero Daphnia foi inclu\u00eddo nos Anomopoda. Aqui, mantemos a designa\u00e7\u00e3o Cladocera pela forte implementa\u00e7\u00e3o do uso do termo (Korovchinsky, 2006) e, sobretudo, porque t\u00eam sido trazidas \u00e0 luz evid\u00eancias de que os clad\u00f3ceros, afinal, constituem um grupo monofil\u00e9tico, apesar de ser d\u00fabia a posi\u00e7\u00e3o dos Haplopoda (Schwenk et al., 1998; Negrea et al., 1999; Korovchinsky, 2006). Actualmente, algumas fontes colocam o g\u00e9nero Daphnia na ordem Anomopoda, integrada na superordem Cladocera.\nOs mecanismos de defesa anti-predat\u00f3rios de Daphnia s\u00e3o numerosos e incluem altera\u00e7\u00f5es comportamentais, morfol\u00f3gicas e populacionais (Lass &amp; Spaak, 2003). As defesas comportamentais s\u00e3o induzidas numa escala temporal muito curta e envolvem a altera\u00e7\u00e3o de comportamentos de evitamento, fototaxia ou agrega\u00e7\u00e3o (Lass &amp; Spaak, 2003), que constituem a base de comportamentos mais complexos como, por exemplo, a migra\u00e7\u00e3o vertical di\u00e1ria (Lampert, 1989; Loose &amp; Dawidowicz, 1994; Ringelberg, 1995; Han &amp; Straskraba, 2001; Ringelberg &amp; Van Gool, 2003). O padr\u00e3o mais habitual deste fen\u00f3meno consiste na perman\u00eancia de uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o de zooplanctontes em \u00e1guas profundas (ref\u00fagio hipolimn\u00e9tico) durante o dia, na ascens\u00e3o para \u00e1guas superficiais durante o crep\u00fasculo, na perman\u00eancia nessas \u00e1guas ricas em alimento durante a noite, e na descida para \u00e1guas frias e escuras ao amanhecer. Este comportamento tem como objectivo \u00faltimo evitar os predadores visuais durante o dia e resulta da percep\u00e7\u00e3o de altera\u00e7\u00f5es di\u00e1rias no gradiente de luz em profundidade (Ringelberg &amp; Van Gool, 2003). Este e outros comportamentos t\u00eam reflexos na distribui\u00e7\u00e3o dos zooplanctontes num lago (Pinel-Alloul, 1995; Folt &amp; Burns, 1999; Hembre &amp; Megard, 2003), podendo originar estrutura\u00e7\u00e3o espacial e fen\u00f3menos de selec\u00e7\u00e3o de habitat. Em Daphnia, as altera\u00e7\u00f5es morfol\u00f3gicas a predadores invertebrados (selectivos para indiv\u00edduos menores) envolvem um aumento do volume corporal (cristas, elmos, espinhos), ao passo que o contr\u00e1rio \u00e9 norma para os peixes planct\u00edvoros (selectivos para indiv\u00edduos maiores), o que constata o valor destas defesas enquanto adapta\u00e7\u00f5es a diferentes regimes predat\u00f3rios (Stabell et al., 2003; Lass &amp; Spaak,\n2003). Apesar do prolongamento do espinho caudal de Daphnia tamb\u00e9m ser frequentemente registado na presen\u00e7a de peixes (Spaak &amp; Boersma, 1997; Caramujo et al., 1997; Stabell et al., 2003), a defesa mais comum \u00e9 a redu\u00e7\u00e3o do tamanho corporal (Engelmayer, 1995; De Meester &amp; Weider, 1999; Sakwinska, 2000; Weber, 2003; Sakwinska &amp; Dawidowicz, 2005). A este mecanismo de defesa morfol\u00f3gica, \u00e9 comum estarem associadas altera\u00e7\u00f5es populacionais que visam o incremento da fecundidade (matura\u00e7\u00e3o precoce, produ\u00e7\u00e3o de mais descend\u00eancia), para fazer face \u00e0s perdas causadas por predadores.\nTodas estas respostas a predadores s\u00e3o mediadas por sinais qu\u00edmicos exsudados pelos peixes planct\u00edvoros (Burks &amp; Lodge, 2002; Lass &amp; Spaak, 2003) e todas t\u00eam custos para o indiv\u00edduo, \u00e0 escala metab\u00f3lica, reprodutiva ou outra (Dawidowicz &amp; Loose, 1992; Loose &amp; Dawidowicz, 1994; Spaak &amp; Boersma, 1997; Caramujo &amp; Boavida, 2000a). N\u00e3o\nsendo mutuamente exclusivas, qualquer combina\u00e7\u00e3o de respostas \u00e9 poss\u00edvel mediante um compromisso entre a estrat\u00e9gia defensiva menos onerosa e a mais eficaz, consoante a situa\u00e7\u00e3o (Boersma et al., 1998; De Meester &amp; Weider, 1999; Sakwinska &amp; Dawidowicz, 2005). A origem, natureza e percep\u00e7\u00e3o do est\u00edmulo qu\u00edmico que estabelece a comunica\u00e7\u00e3o entre predador e presa (Burks &amp; Lodge, 2002; Lass &amp; Spaak, 2003) s\u00e3o campos de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o com respostas ainda pouco concretas.\nLagos pouco profundos vs. lagos profundos\nTradicionalmente, o estudo da Limnologia nasceu e floresceu nos lagos profundos. Segundo Margalef (1983), um \u00abverdadeiro lago\u00bb \u00e9 aquele cujo fundo n\u00e3o recebe luz suficiente para ficar, todo ele, coberto de macr\u00f3fitas e no qual acaba por se formar, durante alguma fase do seu ciclo anual, uma termoclina e consecutivo isolamento relativo das camadas mais profundas da coluna de \u00e1gua. Todavia, os lagos que podem albergar vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o aqu\u00e1tica em quase toda a sua extens\u00e3o e cuja coluna de \u00e1gua sofre mistura constante (lagos polim\u00edcticos) constituem a maioria (em n\u00famero) dos lagos na Biosfera (Wetzel, 1983). S\u00f3 recentemente (\u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas) estes lagos pouco profundos foram alvo de mais aten\u00e7\u00e3o na literatura especializada. Segundo Scheffer (1998), os lagos pouco profundos distinguem-se do objecto tradicional da Limnologia pela maior interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre o sedimento e a coluna de \u00e1gua (originando uma cont\u00ednua liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de f\u00f3sforo) e pela potencialmente maior influ\u00eancia da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o aqu\u00e1tica no funcionamento do sistema (ver Tabela 1). As suas caracter\u00edsticas distintas t\u00eam implica\u00e7\u00f5es nos mecanismos de regula\u00e7\u00e3o tr\u00f3fica abordados at\u00e9 aqui.\nEm condi\u00e7\u00f5es de elevada transpar\u00eancia, a reduzida profundidade dos lagos pouco profundos permite a penetra\u00e7\u00e3o de luz at\u00e9 ao fundo do lago, permitindo o desenvolvimento de macr\u00f3fitas submersas. As macr\u00f3fitas e as ep\u00edfitas associadas competem com o fitopl\u00e2ncton na obten\u00e7\u00e3o de nutrientes e produzindo subst\u00e2ncias alelop\u00e1ticas (Scheffer et al., 1993; Beklioglu &amp; Moss, 1996; Scheffer &amp; Jeppesen, 1998; Burks &amp; Lodge, 2002). As macr\u00f3fitas estabilizam o sedimento, reduzindo a sua ressuspens\u00e3o, sustentam uma mir\u00edade de invertebrados filtradores (Scheffer et al., 1993; Beklioglu &amp; Moss, 1996; Scheffer &amp; Jeppesen, 1998; Jeppesen et al., 2002) e proporcionam ref\u00fagio ao zoopl\u00e2ncton herb\u00edvoro (Jeppesen et al., 1998; Perrow et al., 1999; Burks et al., 2002). Num lago dominado por macr\u00f3fitas submersas, estes mecanismos refor\u00e7am ainda mais o controlo da biomassa\nTabela 1 \u2022 Quadro resumo das principais caracter\u00edsticas distintivas entre os lagos profundos e os lagos pouco profundos (baseado em Jeppesen et al., 1997; 1998; Scheffer, 1998).\nLagos profundos\tLagos pouco profundos\n\u2022\tas flutua\u00e7\u00f5es do n\u00edvel da \u00e1gua t\u00eam um impacto desprez\u00edvel nas comunidades biol\u00f3gicas e no funcionamento do sistema\n\u2022\ta interac\u00e7\u00e3o da \u00e1gua com o sedimento \u00e9 pouco importante devido \u00e0 profundidade e \u00e0 estratifica\u00e7\u00e3o\n\u2022\to impacto da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o aqu\u00e1tica \u00e9 pouco significativo, na medida em que se restringe a zonas marginais\n\u2022\ta elevada profundidade e a estratifica\u00e7\u00e3o t\u00e9rmica providenciam um ref\u00fagio anti-predador para o zoopl\u00e2ncton herb\u00edvoro\n\u2022\tregra geral, os nutrientes s\u00e3o limitativos ao crescimento fitoplanct\u00f3nico, originando a predomin\u00e2ncia do controlo bottom-up\n\u2022\tos peixes desempenham um papel secund\u00e1rio (controlo top-down) sobre a teia tr\u00f3fica pel\u00e1gica e estrutura das comunidades\n\u2022\tas flutua\u00e7\u00f5es no n\u00edvel da \u00e1gua podem ter um impacto dr\u00e1stico nas comunidades biol\u00f3gicas e no funcionamento do sistema\n\u2022\ta intensa mistura da coluna de \u00e1gua resulta numa cont\u00ednua ressuspens\u00e3o de part\u00edculas finas e de f\u00f3sforo do sedimento\n\u2022\to impacto da vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 potencialmente muito grande, mediando a altern\u00e2ncia de estados de transpar\u00eancia e produtividade\n\u2022\to zoopl\u00e2ncton tem de fazer face \u00e0 preda\u00e7\u00e3o intensa na aus\u00eancia do ref\u00fagio hipolimn\u00e9tico, dada a reduzida profundidade\n\u2022\tos mecanismos de controlo bottom-up est\u00e3o enfraquecidos por causa dos n\u00edveis cont\u00ednuos e elevados de nutrientes\n\u2022\to controlo top-down \u00e9 substancial devido \u00e0 elevada biomassa (por unidade de volume) de peixes benti-planct\u00edvoros\nEstes dois estados alternativos (Scheffer et al., 1993; Scheffer &amp; Jeppesen, 1998; Dokulil &amp; Teubner, 2003; Schroder et al., 2005), um dominado por macr\u00f3fitas submersas (\u00e1gua transparente) e outro dominado pelo fitopl\u00e2ncton (\u00e1gua turva), s\u00e3o auto-refor\u00e7ados pelos mecanismos de regula\u00e7\u00e3o mediados pela presen\u00e7a ou aus\u00eancia das macr\u00f3fitas aqu\u00e1ticas. Estes mecanismos fazem com que a resist\u00eancia \u00e0 mudan\u00e7a de estado seja elevada, um fen\u00f3meno denominado de histerese (Scheffer et al., 1993; Scheffer &amp; Jeppesen, 1998; Schroder et al., 2005). Como consequ\u00eancia, n\u00e3o \u00e9 linear que um incremento ou diminui\u00e7\u00e3o na carga de nutrientes tenha como consequ\u00eancia a passagem de um estado para o outro (Scheffer et al., 1993), devido aos v\u00e1rios factores de resist\u00eancia (n\u00e3o s\u00f3 relacionados com as macr\u00f3fitas - ver abaixo e Tabela 1). Em particular, o retorno de um lago no estado turvo (domin\u00e2ncia do fitopl\u00e2ncton) para um estado de maior\ntranspar\u00eancia (domin\u00e2ncia de macr\u00f3fitas submersas) \u00e9 particularmente dif\u00edcil (Scheffer et al., 1993; Scheffer, 1998), apesar de uma fase transit\u00f3ria de \u00e1gua transparente poder ocorrer em lagos turvos, na Primavera (conforme previsto no modelo PEG, ver acima). O regresso a um estado de domin\u00e2ncia de macr\u00f3fitas submersas (\u00e1gua transparente) \u00e9 o objectivo \u00faltimo da biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o (ver acima) dos lagos pouco profundos (Moss, 1992; Scheffer et al., 1993; Perrow et al., 1997; Dokulil &amp; Teubner, 2003).\nPara al\u00e9m das macr\u00f3fitas, tamb\u00e9m os peixes podem desempenhar um papel central na altern\u00e2ncia entre estados e nos mecanismos de histerese. Directamente, os peixes contribuem para o aumento de nutrientes na coluna de \u00e1gua atrav\u00e9s da sua reciclagem (excre\u00e7\u00e3o de metabolitos) e promovem a turbidez ao facilitarem a ressuspens\u00e3o do sedimento (Scheffer et al., 1993; 2003). Adicionalmente, os peixes planct\u00edvoros promovem o crescimento descontrolado do fitopl\u00e2ncton ao exercerem forte press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria sobre o zoopl\u00e2ncton herb\u00edvoro de grandes dimens\u00f5es (sobretudo Daphnia, conforme explicado acima). Este facto \u00e9 agravado pela import\u00e2ncia do controlo top-down pelos peixes (especialmente as formas juvenis) ser consideravelmente mais elevada em lagos pouco profundos, por v\u00e1rios motivos (aus\u00eancia de ref\u00fagio hipolimn\u00e9tico do zoopl\u00e2ncton, maior biomassa de peixes por unidade de volume, entre outros), conforme postulado por Jeppesen et al. (1997). Por outro lado, o efeito estimulante indirecto dos peixes planct\u00edvoros sobre a produ\u00e7\u00e3o fitoplanct\u00f3nica \u00e9 mais significativo a altos n\u00edveis de nutrientes, quando comparado com os efeitos observados a reduzidos n\u00edveis de f\u00f3sforo (Jeppesen et al., 2003). Deste modo, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel identificar uma cascata tr\u00f3fica nos lagos pouco profundos e eutr\u00f3ficos que fomenta a ocorr\u00eancia e perman\u00eancia (histerese) de um estado de domin\u00e2ncia algal (elevada turbidez). Este fen\u00f3meno \u00e9 comprovado pelas experi\u00eancias de Tessier &amp; Woodruff (2002a; 2002b) que mostraram que os recursos algais s\u00e3o mais ricos nos lagos pouco profundos (com press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria mais elevada sobre o zoopl\u00e2ncton) do que nos lagos profundos, demonstrando que o zoopl\u00e2ncton \u00e9 incapaz de controlar o crescimento do fitopl\u00e2ncton nos lagos pouco profundos.\nA compreens\u00e3o da interac\u00e7\u00e3o peixes-zoopl\u00e2ncton \u00e9 vital para a biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o e nos lagos pouco profundos este elo ganha uma nova dimens\u00e3o com a presen\u00e7a de macr\u00f3fitas (mediadoras da altern\u00e2ncia de estados). Esta \u00e1rea tem sido motivo de alguma investiga\u00e7\u00e3o (Schriver et al., 1995; Beklioglu &amp; Moss, 1996; Jeppesen et al., 1998; Perrow et al., 1999; Burks et al., 2002), j\u00e1 que essa informa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 necess\u00e1ria para que os planos de\nrecupera\u00e7\u00e3o dos lagos pouco profundos sejam bem sucedidos. Contudo, \u00e9 ainda contradit\u00f3ria a informa\u00e7\u00e3o dispon\u00edvel sobre a forma como as macr\u00f3fitas influenciam a interac\u00e7\u00e3o entre peixes e zoopl\u00e2ncton. Um bom exemplo \u00e9 o ref\u00fagio contra predadores (peixes) supostamente proporcionado pelas macr\u00f3fitas ao zoopl\u00e2ncton. V\u00e1rios trabalhos relataram evid\u00eancias de que o zoopl\u00e2ncton pode formar agrega\u00e7\u00f5es em zonas de macr\u00f3fitas durante o dia (Kvam &amp; Kleiven, 1995; Lauridsen &amp; Buenk, 1996; Masson et al., 2001; Wojtal et al., 2003), como alternativa face \u00e0 aus\u00eancia do ref\u00fagio hipolimn\u00e9tico dos lagos profundos. Durante a noite, o zoopl\u00e2ncton tende a dispersar-se pela zona pel\u00e1gica adjacente - migra\u00e7\u00e3o horizontal di\u00e1ria (ver revis\u00e3o por Burks et al., 2002). Este fen\u00f3meno tem sido registado em lagos pouco profundos do Norte da Europa de forma pouco consistente por v\u00e1rios autores, que defendem que o ref\u00fagio proporcionado pelas macr\u00f3fitas parece depender do estado tr\u00f3fico (Lauridsen et al., 1999), mas tamb\u00e9m de um equil\u00edbrio entre a press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria e a densidade das macr\u00f3fitas (Schriver et al., 1995; Lauridsen et al., 1996; Jeppesen et al., 1998; Perrow et al., 1999; Burks et al., 2002). Todavia, muitas esp\u00e9cies de peixes juvenis tamb\u00e9m recorrem \u00e0s macr\u00f3fitas como ref\u00fagio contra predadores de maiores dimens\u00f5es (Burks et al., 2002; Romare et al., 2003; Romare &amp; Hansson, 2003), podendo provocar perdas severas nas popula\u00e7\u00f5es zooplanct\u00f3nicas nessas \u00e1reas (Perrow et al., 1999; H\u00fclsmann et al., 1999; Masson et al., 2001), reduzindo a efici\u00eancia do ref\u00fagio proporcionado ao zoopl\u00e2ncton.\nOs lagos pouco profundos no contexto Mediterr\u00e2nico\nA vasta maioria dos estudos em lagos pouco profundos foi realizada em pa\u00edses temperados do norte da Europa e nos Estados Unidos. Em particular na Europa, a Dinamarca e a B\u00e9lgica/Holanda lideraram durante muito tempo a investiga\u00e7\u00e3o no campo da ecologia dos lagos pouco profundos, acompanhados de perto pela Gr\u00e3-Bretanha e pelos pa\u00edses escandinavos (Su\u00e9cia/Finl\u00e2ndia). Tal facto deve-se \u00e0 abund\u00e2ncia e import\u00e2ncia destas zonas h\u00famidas nesses pa\u00edses, por oposi\u00e7\u00e3o aos pa\u00edses mais montanhosos do centro da Europa, onde os lagos profundos (normalmente de origem glaciar) adquiriram maior destaque. No sul da Europa, devido \u00e0 influ\u00eancia do quente clima Mediterr\u00e2nico, os lagos naturais rareiam e os poucos lagos pouco profundos que existem est\u00e3o sob a frequente amea\u00e7a da seca. Talvez por isso, e n\u00e3o obstante a import\u00e2ncia das zonas h\u00famidas enquanto motores de biodiversidade, a pesquisa cient\u00edfica nos lagos pouco profundos Mediterr\u00e2nicos\ntenha adquirido pouco destaque. Contudo, existem evid\u00eancias de desvios \u00e0 norma aos mecanismos de regula\u00e7\u00e3o tr\u00f3fica abordados anteriormente para lagos temperados profundos, ainda mais evidentes do que \u00e9 poss\u00edvel observar em outros lagos pouco profundos. Por exemplo, tem sido registado em lagos pouco profundos mais quentes (sobretudo tropicais e subtropicais) que a biomassa fitoplanct\u00f3nica n\u00e3o \u00e9 controlada pelo zoopl\u00e2ncton herb\u00edvoro (Havens et al., 1996) e que a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o deste tipo de lagos \u00e9 mais dif\u00edcil (Jeppesen et al., 2005). Consequentemente, h\u00e1 necessidade de informa\u00e7\u00e3o mais espec\u00edfica sobre os mecanismos de regula\u00e7\u00e3o tr\u00f3fica destes sistemas.\nO mecanismo de resist\u00eancia biol\u00f3gica mais apontado \u00e0 recupera\u00e7\u00e3o dos lagos eutr\u00f3ficos de zonas mais quentes \u00e9 a sua distinta ictiocenose, dominada por esp\u00e9cies com reduzido tamanho corporal e de h\u00e1bitos omn\u00edvoros (Blanco et al., 2003; Jeppesen et al., 2005). Daqui resulta uma ictiocenose caracterizada por uma elevada densidade de pequenas esp\u00e9cies altamente fecundas (como resultado do aproveitamento de v\u00e1rios recursos alimentares), exercendo uma press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria sobre o zoopl\u00e2ncton mais elevada e mais prolongada no tempo do que sucede em lagos temperados (Blanco et al., 2003; Jeppesen et al., 2005; Gyllstrom et al., 2005). Como agravante, Burks et al. (2002) consideram que esta predomin\u00e2ncia de esp\u00e9cies benti-planct\u00edvoras de pequenas dimens\u00f5es dever\u00e1 reduzir drasticamente a efici\u00eancia do ref\u00fagio proporcionado pelas macr\u00f3fitas (ver tamb\u00e9m Meerhoff et al., 2006), dado os h\u00e1bitos litorais destes pequenos peixes. Outra caracter\u00edstica distintiva das ictiocenoses tropicais \u00e9 a reduzida express\u00e3o de grandes pisc\u00edvoros, o que diminui substancialmente o controlo exercido por estes sobre os peixes benti-planct\u00edvoros quando comparado com os lagos temperados (Jeppesen et al., 2005). Esta situa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 tamb\u00e9m partilhada pela ictiofauna Ib\u00e9rica (Alma\u00e7a, 1995; Blanco et al., 2003), o que posiciona as teias tr\u00f3ficas dos lagos Ib\u00e9ricos e Mediterr\u00e2nicos num contexto ecol\u00f3gico pr\u00f3prio dentro da Europa. Mais, o estudo de Blanco et al. (2003) sugere que a introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies alien\u00edgenas (ou ex\u00f3ticas) como a gamb\u00fazia (Gambusia holbrooki) e a perca-sol (Lepomis gibbosus} tem agravado o grau de omnivoria da ictiocenose dos lagos Ib\u00e9ricos e a aproximado das caracter\u00edsticas das ictiocenoses tropicais.\nA posi\u00e7\u00e3o especial dos pa\u00edses Mediterr\u00e2nicos no contexto dos lagos pouco profundos, e em particular da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica, tem sido reconhecida em v\u00e1rios trabalhos recentes. Estudos comparativos realizados em larga escala (Noges et al., 2003; Gyllstrom et al., 2005; Declerck et al., 2005) inclu\u00edram diversos locais de amostragem em Espanha,\nao passo que uma recente experi\u00eancia pan-europeia (e.g. Stephen et al., 2004; Moss et al.,\n2004)\tteve em considera\u00e7\u00e3o a latitude ao avaliar os efeitos do incremento da carga de nutrientes e de peixes em lagos pouco profundos (simula\u00e7\u00f5es experimentais em mesocosmos). Os resultados desta experi\u00eancia em larga escala vieram confirmar que os lagos pouco profundos da zona Mediterr\u00e2nica s\u00e3o mais sens\u00edveis ao incremento da carga de nutrientes do que os lagos temperados (ver tamb\u00e9m Romo et al., 2004). Paralelamente, num interessante caso de estudo, Romo et al. (2005) demonstraram tamb\u00e9m que, mesmo ap\u00f3s a diminui\u00e7\u00e3o da carga de nutrientes, n\u00e3o foi poss\u00edvel fazer regressar o Lago Albufera (Val\u00eancia) ao estado anterior, nem tampouco a um estado de domin\u00e2ncia de macr\u00f3fitas capaz de estabilizar a transpar\u00eancia da \u00e1gua.\nEm suma, os lagos pouco profundos do sul da Europa (sob a influ\u00eancia do clima Mediterr\u00e2nico) parecem estar sob efeitos top-down mais acentuados do que os lagos pouco profundos mais a norte, aumentando a sua vulnerabilidade \u00e0 eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o e a sua resist\u00eancia \u00e0 mudan\u00e7a para um estado de \u00e1gua transparente. Tal como os outros lagos pouco profundos, tamb\u00e9m os lagos Mediterr\u00e2nicos desempenham um papel ecol\u00f3gico e socio-econ\u00f3mico (em alguns casos) importante, particularmente se olhados como componente de um sistema terrestre mais vasto enquanto zona h\u00famida (Scheffer, 1998). Estes habitats suportam uma consider\u00e1vel biodiversidade, mas o seu valor encontra-se habitualmente comprometido pelo enriquecimento em nutrientes (agravado por actividades humanas). Do ponto de vista cient\u00edfico, levanta-se o desafio de melhor compreender os mecanismos de interac\u00e7\u00e3o tr\u00f3fica subjacentes a esta maior vulnerabilidade \u00e0 eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o dos lagos pouco profundos Mediterr\u00e2nicos. Numa perspectiva mais aplicada, o uso desta informa\u00e7\u00e3o permitir\u00e1 decis\u00f5es de gest\u00e3o melhor enquadradas e com maiores probabilidades de sucesso a longo prazo.\nUm bom exemplo da problem\u00e1tica dos lagos pouco profundos da regi\u00e3o Mediterr\u00e2nica \u00e9 a Lagoa da Vela, local escolhido como objecto de estudo do presente trabalho. Esta pequena massa de \u00e1gua permanente (ver Caixa B), outrora transparente e com grande variedade de peixes (segundo os habitantes locais), encontra-se actualmente sob forte carga de nutrientes, elevada turbidez e reduzida cobertura de macr\u00f3fitas (Fernandes, 1999; Antunes et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2006a; 2006b). Este estado de \u00e1gua turva avan\u00e7ado \u00e9 ainda agravado pela presen\u00e7a recorrente de cianobact\u00e9rias, muitas delas altamente t\u00f3xicas (Vasconcelos, 1990; Barros, 1994; Figueiredo et al., 2006; Abrantes et\nal., 2006a). Apesar da falta de dados hist\u00f3ricos que pudessem funcionar como base de partida para um plano de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o adequado, foram j\u00e1 produzidas duas teses (Pereira, 1997; Fernandes, 1999) com recomenda\u00e7\u00f5es e ferramentas para a gest\u00e3o das Lagoas de Quiaios, mormente a Lagoa da Vela. O trabalho de Fernandes (1999) \u00e9 particularmente pormenorizado na caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema (ver Caixa B) e prop\u00f5e um modelo para a an\u00e1lise e gest\u00e3o do problema da eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o. Apesar deste estudo referir a biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o como medida adicional no combate \u00e0 eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o, nenhum estudo at\u00e9 \u00e0 data analisou de forma integrada as potenciais cascatas tr\u00f3ficas resultantes da preda\u00e7\u00e3o pelos peixes na Lagoa. Mais, os dados sobre a ictiofauna da Lagoa da Vela s\u00e3o muito limitados (o \u00fanico estudo \u00e9 o de Ferreira, 1997), apesar das evid\u00eancias de um forte controlo top-down sobre o zoopl\u00e2ncton (elemento chave no controlo da produ\u00e7\u00e3o fitoplanct\u00f3nica, ver acima). De facto, o papel estruturante da ictiocenose sobre a comunidade planct\u00f3nica da Lagoa ficou bem patente em 2001, quando se verificou uma fase de domin\u00e2ncia de Daphnia no Ver\u00e3o ap\u00f3s uma mortandade massiva de peixes no final de Maio, originando um controlo efectivo do crescimento fitoplanct\u00f3nico (Antunes et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2006a).\nA ictiocenose da Lagoa da Vela possui h\u00e1 largas d\u00e9cadas uma componente forte de esp\u00e9cies alien\u00edgenas, cuja introdu\u00e7\u00e3o foi promovida por motivos piscat\u00f3rios (sobretudo a carpa, Cyprinus carpio, e o achig\u00e3, Micropterus salmoides) ou como ferramentas de controlo do mosquito da mal\u00e1ria (gamb\u00fazia ou gambuzino, Gambusia holbrooki). Estas esp\u00e9cies invasoras rapidamente formaram popula\u00e7\u00f5es est\u00e1veis, promovendo a elimina\u00e7\u00e3o de algumas esp\u00e9cies ind\u00edgenas. O estudo de Ferreira (1997) revelara j\u00e1 uma ictiocenose pouco diversificada, mas desde ent\u00e3o a comunidade \u00edctica tornou-se mais homog\u00e9nea com a r\u00e1pida prolifera\u00e7\u00e3o da perca-sol, Lepomis gibbosus, ausente \u00e0 data deste estudo pioneiro. Daqui resultou uma comunidade quase totalmente alien\u00edgena, dominada por esp\u00e9cies omn\u00edvoras de pequenas dimens\u00f5es (sobretudo gamb\u00fazia e perca-sol), cujos efeitos nos n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos inferiores n\u00e3o s\u00e3o ainda totalmente compreendidos. Apesar da Lagoa da Vela constituir um exemplo extremo ao n\u00edvel da ictiocenose, a altera\u00e7\u00e3o das comunidades pisc\u00edcolas (por homogeneiza\u00e7\u00e3o bi\u00f3tica) e consequente modifica\u00e7\u00e3o das interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas \u00e9 um problema comum a outros sistemas l\u00eanticos (e.g. Rodr\u00edguez, 1989; Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Blanco et al., 2003) e l\u00f3ticos (e.g. Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1998; 2000; Vila-Gispert et al., 2005) Ib\u00e9ricos.\nCaixa B - Caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o do local de estudo: Lagoa da Vela\nA Lagoa da Vela \u00e9 um pequeno lago natural e permanente, resultante da acumula\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua numa depress\u00e3o superficial, localizada na interface entre o cord\u00e3o dunar de Quiaios (a oeste) e a plan\u00edcie da G\u00e1ndara (a leste). Esta zona de interface compreende ainda outros tr\u00eas pequenos lagos de \u00e1gua doce mais ou menos permanentes (Fernandes, 1999). As dunas de Quiaios s\u00e3o parte de um extenso cord\u00e3o dunar que se estende desde o Cabo Modego (Figueira da Foz) at\u00e9 ao sul da Ria de Aveiro (Mira e Vagos) e que alberga vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o essencialmente constitu\u00edda por matos e por pinhal (Pinus spp.), este \u00faltimo plantado com o objectivo de impedir o avan\u00e7o das areias para o interior (Pereira, 1997). Esta zona da costa Atl\u00e1ntica Portuguesa, recentemente incorporada na lista nacional de s\u00edtios da Rede Natura 2000* (PTCON0055 - s\u00edtio das Dunas de Mira, G\u00e1ndara e Gafanhas), alberga habitats diversificados e vasta biodiversidade (ver caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o ecol\u00f3gica em Pereira, 1997; Fernandes, 1999). Englobada nesta \u00e1rea, a Lagoa da Vela proporciona recursos (alimento) e condi\u00e7\u00f5es (locais de nidifica\u00e7\u00e3o e desova) para numerosas esp\u00e9cies aqu\u00e1ticas e terrestres (nomeadamente aves), contribuindo de forma significativa para a biodiversidade da \u00e1rea.\nA Lagoa da Vela \u00e9 a maior das lagoas de Quiaios, ocupando uma \u00e1rea m\u00e1xima inund\u00e1vel de 70 ha (1 ha = 0,01 km2). Enquanto lago natural, est\u00e1 em continuidade com o aqu\u00edfero fre\u00e1tico local, cuja recarga depende exclusivamente da precipita\u00e7\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica. Um sistema de valas e canais interliga esta massa de \u00e1gua com as outras lagoas da zona, sendo que, nos per\u00edodos mais h\u00famidos, a drenagem da lagoa \u00e9 feita para o Rio Mondego, via vala do Zurr\u00e3o, no extremo sul da lagoa (ver caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o hidrol\u00f3gica em Fernandes, 1999).\nToda a bacia drenante da Lagoa da Vela tem uso rural do solo, distribu\u00edda em ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o florestal-natural na margem oeste e ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o agr\u00edcola e pecu\u00e1ria (incluindo habita\u00e7\u00f5es) na margem este. As actividades humanas na \u00e1rea adjacente \u00e0 lagoa geram fontes difusas de poluentes. Como consequ\u00eancia, a lagoa tem mantido uma carga de nutrientes muito grande nas \u00faltimas d\u00e9cadas, t\u00edpica de lagos eutr\u00f3ficos e proveniente sobretudo do escoamento superficial dos terrenos agr\u00edcolas adjacentes (no caso do P e N) e por deposi\u00e7\u00e3o atmosf\u00e9rica (no caso do N) (ver caracteriza\u00e7\u00e3o das fontes poluentes em Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes et al., 2006b).\nCaracter\u00edsticas morfom\u00e9tricas da Lagoa da Vela (adaptado de Fernandes, 1999):\nLargura m\u00e1xima\t500 m\nComprimento m\u00e1ximo\t2000 m\nLinha de costa - per\u00edmetro\t5000 m\nProfundidade m\u00e1xima\t2,4 m\nProfundidade m\u00e9dia\t0,9 m\n\u00c1rea m\u00e1xima inund\u00e1vel\t70 ha\nVolume m\u00e1ximo armazen\u00e1vel\t700 000 m3\n* A Rede Natura 2000 \u00e9 uma rede ecol\u00f3gica que resulta da pol\u00edtica de Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da Natureza da Uni\u00e3o Europeia (UE) e da aplica\u00e7\u00e3o das Directivas n\u00b0 79/409/CEE (Directiva Aves) e n\u00b0 92/45/CEE (Directiva Habitats).

To address this gap, we conducted a study on the seasonal dynamics of the zooplankton community in Lake Vela (Portugal), a turbid and eutrophic shallow lake, which exhibits marked dominance of alien fish species. Lake Vela was shown to be highly productive and turbid, except during a period of higher transparency, from January to April. The increase in transparency was attributable to a rise in water level, which reduced the amount of resuspended particles. Transparency was additionally improved by a peak in Daphnia longispina densities (February and March), which transiently reduced chl a to low levels (clear water phase). In the remainder of the year, the zooplanktonic assemblage was dominated by small-sized zooplankters (mainly Bosmina and cyclopoid copepods). Daphnia were virtually absent from August to December. Regression and multivariate analyses identified seston and fish predation as the main environmental gradients shaping the zooplanktonic assemblage. During the clear water phase, competition for resources also seemed to contribute to Daphnia dynamics. The observed pattern of seasonal dynamics of the zooplankton of Lake Vela was overall concordant with the PEG model, although different timings were perceptible, namely concerning the Daphnia peak and the more prolonged influence of fish, relatively to northern temperate lakes. Our results suggest that both planktivory (by alien fish) and turbidity (seston) are issues that need to be addressed if adequate restoration programs are to be implemented.\nKEYWORDS\nfreshwater zooplankton, seasonal dynamics, PEG model, Mediterranean lakes, Daphnia\nIntroduction\nAccording to Scheffer (1998), shallow lakes possess distinctive features from deep thermally-stratified lakes, as the result of a more intense sediment-water interaction (due to polymixis) and a larger impact of aquatic vegetation. Studies on shallow lakes are common in northern temperate regions, but few works have focused on warmer areas, such as Mediterranean countries. A recent pan-European project (Romo et al., 2004; Moss et al., 2004) has provided evidence that lakes from warmer regions of the temperate zone are more vulnerable to nutrient loading (i.e. eutrophication). Furthermore, some resemblances in the features of the fish community between tropical lakes and some Iberian lakes have\nbeen recognised (Blanco et al., 2003), due to the predominance of small omnivorous species and low abundance of piscivores. These latter features are particularly aggravated by the vulnerability of Iberian fish faunas to invaders, such as pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) or mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki). The implications of such distinct features on trophic cascades and alternating stable states in shallow lakes have still been largely unexplored.\nAlthough rare in Iberia (because of the dry climate), shallow lakes constitute important pools of biodiversity and provide unique ecological niches. However, these habitats usually face the threat of eutrophication, fish fauna homogenisation and man-induced change. Lake Vela (Portugal) represents an interesting case study in Iberia, as its native cyprinid assemblage has been completely replaced by alien fish, over the course of the last century. However, data on the dynamics of its biota and food web interactions are very limited (see e.g. Fernandes, 1999; Antunes et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2006a), which is particularly serious because this eutrophic and turbid lake requires urgent restoration. Restoration measures may include food web manipulation, which depends on the key role of grazers (mainly Daphnia) as controllers of phytoplankton biomass and water transparency (Carpenter et al., 1985). However, this control is only effective once zooplankton is released from fish predation, as shown in several biomanipulation experiments (e.g. Christofferson et al., 1993; Carpenter et al., 2001) and as predicted by the size-efficiency hypothesis (Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965). In Lake Vela, the structuring role of fish on the zooplankton community was evident in 2001, when a massive fish kill preceded a large Daphnia peak and low phytoplanktonic production during that summer (Antunes et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2006a).\nIn this study, we intend to provide additional information on trophic interactions and regulation mechanisms of the zooplankton assemblage of Lake Vela. To do so, we conducted an annual survey on its limnology and zooplankton assemblage, and we collected seasonal data on its fish assemblage (see also Castro et al., submitted manuscript1). Our main goals were: i) to identify the seasonal patterns of the crustacean zooplankton and their underlying regulation mechanisms, with emphasis on Daphnia dynamics; ii) to understand the role of grazing (chiefly by Daphnia) in the formation of a clear water phase; iii) to assess the cascading effects of predation (i.e. top-down forces)\n1 Cap\u00edtulo 2 da tese\nMaterials and methods\nStudy site\nLake Vela is located in the west coast of central Portugal (Figure 1.1), lying in a transition between Mediterranean (southwards) and Atlantic (northwards) bioclimates. Lake Vela is a small (maximum floodable area 70 ha), shallow (0.9 m average depth; 2.4 m maximum depth) and polymictic water body, being the largest lake of a system of small lakes located within a coastal pine wood forest.\nFigure 1.1 \u2022 Location and outline of Lake Vela (Figueira da Foz, Portugal). M (macrophyte) and P (pelagial) represent sampling stations (sites).\nHigh nutrient levels are recorded all year-round, mostly derived from agriculture and livestock activities (diffuse pollution) (Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes et al., 2006b). The main planktivorous fish in Lake Vela are pumpkinseed, mosquitofish and age-0 largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides). They exert substantial predatory pressure on zooplankton, particularly during the summer due to very high densities of juvenile pumpkinseed (see Results). More detailed data on the recruitment patterns and feeding ecology of fish taxa is presented elsewhere (Castro et al., submitted manuscript). Predatory\npressure from pelagic invertebrates (such as Chaoborus) is negligible, as these predators are seldom found in Lake Vela. Cyanobacterial blooms are frequent and occasional episodes of oxygen shortage and fish kills have occurred in recent years (Antunes et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2006a). The water is usually very turbid due to high primary productivity, suspended particles and dissolved organic substances. Submerged aquatic vegetation is scarce in the lakebed and the main macrophyte species is the alien water-lily (Nymphaea alba), which is restricted to patches of variable size. More details on Lake Vela can be found in Fernandes (1999), Antunes et al. (2003) and Abrantes et al. (2006a; 2006b).\nSampling strategy\nSampling was carried out fortnightly using a small boat, at two adjacent points in the lake: a pelagial zone (macrophyte-free) and a macrophyte (Nymphaea alba) patch (P and M in Figure 1.1, respectively). Sampling in M was performed in the periphery of the macrophyte bed, where some zooplankters tend to aggregate (Lauridsen &amp; Buenk, 1996). The macrophyte bed was dense (coverage area > 75%) and large (circa 20 x 10 m), although seasonal variation in size occurred. Water temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen levels were measured in situ with appropriate portable meters, whilst transparency and depth were determined using a Secchi disk. Air temperature was measured with a thermometer, while precipitation data for the region were obtained from the Portuguese Water Institute (INAG - http://snirh.inag.pt). A 1.5-L water sample was collected and transported (in the dark, at 4\u00b0C) to the laboratory for determination of colour at 320 nm (CDOC) - an indirect measure of dissolved organic carbon (Williamson et al.,\n1999), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorous (TP), suspended solids (seston) and phaeophytin-corrected chlorophyll a (chl a). A preliminary oxidation step was necessary for the determination of TN and TP (Ebina et al., 1983). For zooplankton, composite water samples were collected with a vertical Van Dorn bottle and concentrated with a 55-^m-mesh plankton net. The entire water column was sampled, with the exception of the layer closest to sediments, as this would represent noise and bias from the re-suspension of organic particles and dead zooplankters, respectively. The sampled volume ranged between 16L and 25.6L, depending on the total zooplankton densities. Each sample was immediately preserved in sucrose-saturated 4% formalin, stained with Bengal rose, and\nstored until further examination. In the laboratory, cladocerans were identified to the genus/species level (following the nomenclature of Alonso, 1996) and copepods were separated into nauplii and cyclopoid or calanoid (copepodites + adults). Counting by subsampling was used for the most abundant taxa, with at least 100 individuals of the dominant zooplankton species being counted and the total number of counts always being higher than 400. When necessary, the whole sample was screened in order to enumerate large organisms (especially for Daphnia). Zooplankton abundance data were expressed as densities (ind L-1).\nFish were caught using seine nets and electrofishing (with identical sampling effort) and their abundance, size structure and diet were assessed (additional details in Castro et al., submitted manuscript). Because fish sampling was not carried out in the same temporal scale as zooplankton, we defined fish predation as a function of the recruitment patterns and feeding ecology of the main planktivores jointly with the abiotic frame (temperature, water level and daylight duration). Thus, a categorical variable (FISH) representing the theoretical fish predation pressure on zooplankton was allowed to vary discretely from 1 (lowest predation pressure) to 5 (highest predation pressure) - see Results.\nEnvironment and community data analysis\nTo assess which abiotic and biotic variables were the most important determinants of key limnological features of Lake Vela (transparency, seston, chl a and Daphnia density), simple linear regression and stepwise multiple regression were used to measure the proportion of variation explained by the predictor variables. Data were log-transformed whenever linearity was substantially improved. In the multiple regression analysis, a 0.10 cut-off value was used in the stepwise selection procedure. Simple regression analysis was also used to assess the strength of the relationship between FISH and the main zooplanktonic taxa densities.\nDetrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used to describe the main sources of variation in the zooplankton assemblage data (excluding rare taxa). DCA is an improved eigenvector ordination technique based on reciprocal (weighted) averaging, which is commonly used in community ecology (Gauch, 1982; ter Braak, 1995). Its purpose is to reduce a species x sample matrix to a few dimensions (the eigenvectors) that explain the\nhighest proportion of total variation in the data. Similar taxa are grouped based on common occurrence and the ordination can be interpreted with external data (see ter Braak, 1995), identifying potential sources of variation or environmental gradients. We evaluated the contribution of seasonal and spatial variation in the ordination with a two-way ANOVA using month and site (macrophyte vs. pelagial) as factors and each of the sample scores (for axis 1 and axis 2) as the dependent variables. In addition, correlation analysis was used to measure the association between log-transformed environmental variables (including FISH) and the first two DCA dimensions.\nDaphnia dynamics\nThe average body size (from the top of the carapace to the base of the tail spine) of Daphnia longispina was estimated by measuring a random sub-sample of 100 individuals in each sample or all individuals in the sample, if N<100. The proportion of ovigerous (subitaneous and ephippial eggs) females relatively to the total number of Daphnia was also estimated from this sub-sample or from the whole sample (if N<100). Based on an initial assessment of the Daphnia data (see Results), we pooled the reproductive and body size data into two periods (corresponding to different predation pressure and transparency levels) and we determined size at maturity (SAM), for each combination of period and site (pelagial/macrophyte), as the smaller size-class of egg-bearing females, using a 5% cut-off value to discard precocious primiparae (Caramujo et al., 1997). A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences in body size and proportion of females between period (using dates as replicates within period) and site, as well as for period x site interaction. Data on the proportion of females were arcsine square-root transformed, arcsin (Vx), prior to the ANOVAs. In order to determine which abiotic and biotic factors exerted a control on the Daphnia dynamics, we individually plotted the data on body size, proportion of ovigerous females and density against a priori selected variables (temperature, chl a and Daphnia densities) for both periods. Linear regression analyses were used to determine the significance of the relationships. Data were log transformed when necessary, in order to maximise linearity.\nResults\nEnvironmental parameters and fish\nThe seasonal variation of the physical and chemical parameters and chlorophyll a of Lake Vela is presented in Figure 1.2. Daylight duration varied from a maximum of 15 hrs in June to a minimum of 9 hrs and 15 min in December. Rainfall varied seasonally and air temperatures were occasionally very high (>30\u00b0C). Water temperatures were warm during the summer (around 25\u00b0C) but they were mild during most part of the year (minimum 9.7\u00b0C). Conductivity levels were more or less constant, while pH values were always slightly alkaline, increasing during the summer (up to 9.9) and decreasing due to rainfall. Water level varied from a minimum of 0.45 m at the end of the summer and a maximum of 1.5 m at the end of the most intense rainfall period (December). Lake Vela was highly turbid (Secchi depth &lt;30 cm), except when it experienced a transient clear water phase from January onwards, with transparency levels ranging from 60 cm to 115 cm. Some environmental variables were measured simultaneously in M (macrophyte) and in P (pelagial) and a good correspondence was found between sites for dissolved oxygen, colour (CDOC), TN, TP, seston and chlorophyll a, in spite of fluctuations (Figure 1.2, right panel). High nutrient levels were found in Lake Vela: mean TN was 2.2 mg N L-1 (range: 0.62-3.6 mg N L-1) and mean TP was 0.18 mg P L-1 (range: 0.081-0.34 mg P L-1). The seasonal pattern exhibited by suspended particles (seston) confirmed the shift from a turbid (May-November) to a clear water phase (December-May). However, chlorophyll a did not show a pattern consistent with alternating phases, due to extreme variation. In fact, chl a reached its highest (296 mg L-1) and lowest (18.2 mg L-1) levels during the clear water phase.\nThe ichthyocenosis of Lake Vela was dominated in numbers by littoral mosquitofish and pumpkinseed (dominant in biomass). Juvenile largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) were represented from May to October, but planktivory was restricted to its early life stages (May and June). No juvenile bass were observed prior to May (fish data from April 2003 not shown here). The dynamics of the main planktivorous fish during the growing season is shown in Figure 1.3. Theoretical predation pressure on zooplankton (categorical variable FISH) was defined as a function of the presence of juvenile fish from April to October and extrapolated outside of this period based on water temperature, water level and daylight duration (Figure 1.3; see also Figure 1.2).\n250\n200\n150\n100\n225\n150\n75\n0\n2003\n2004\n2003\n2004\n50\n0\n60\n45\n4\n3\n30\n2\n1\n0\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n300\n0\n5\nO)\n<0\nE,\nE\nO\nFigure 1.2 \u2022 Physical and chemical variables recorded during the study period in Lake Vela.

FISH is a dummy variable representing the level of predation pressure on zooplankton (see text for additional explanation).\nZooplankton community\nThe crustacean zooplankton of Lake Vela was not very diversified, being clearly dominated by small-bodied cladocerans (Bosmina longirostris and Chydorus sp.) and cyclopoid copepods and nauplii (Table 1.1). Daphnia longispina was also well represented, displaying seasonal fluctuations, which included absence periods (Figure 1.4). A pronounced seasonal dynamics was observed in the zooplankton assemblage (Figure 1.4). Nauplii and cyclopoid copepods were the exception, as they showed more or less constant densities during the year (except during early spring). Bosmina and Chydorus were present\nTable 1.1 \u2022 Zooplanktonic crustacean taxa observed in Lake Vela during the study period and corresponding abbreviations (taxa lacking abbreviation were excluded from the DCA analysis).

A log scale was used to display densities, in order to facilitate the comprehension of the different orders of magnitude of the taxa.\nEnvironment- and fish-zooplankton interactions\nMost of the variation in water transparency (Table 1.2) was explained by seston (90%), followed by the densities of Daphnia (positive association) and small cladocerans (negative association). A weak relationship was found between chl a and transparency. In stepwise multiple regression (Table 1.2), the additional contribution of Daphnia density and water level was residual, when compared to seston. These results led us to focus on the underlying variation of seston, which was mostly (61%) due to variations in water level, although small cladocerans and Daphnia also contributed significantly (Table 1.3). In both\ncases (seston and transparency), daphniids and small-sized cladocerans displayed similar associations with the dependent variable, but in opposite directions. In fact, high Daphnia densities generally corresponded to low densities of small cladocerans - see Figure 1.4. Water level and small cladoceran densities together explained 78% of the variation in seston (Table 1.3). Variation in chl a was mostly unexplained, but Daphnia density explained a fraction (17%) of its total variation (Table 1.4). No relationships were found between chl a and TP, TN or seston.\nTable 1.2 \u2022 Simple linear regressions and stepwise multiple regression of several abiotic and biotic variables on transparency (Secchi depth) (n = 26).

Still, both axes (sample scores) revealed a seasonal component in the zooplankton assemblage (two-way ANOVA for month: axis 1 - F11,28 = 28, P = 0.000; axis 2 - F11,28 = 12, P = 0.000). No significant effects were found for site (axis 1 - F1,28 = 0.10, P = 0.758; axis 2 - F1,28 = 0.15, P = 0.698) or its interaction with month (axis 1 - F11,28 = 0.08, P = 1.000; axis 2 - F11,28 = 0.28, P = 0.985). The seasonal component of each axis was attributable to different features (or environmental gradients), as shown by correlation analyses (Table 1.5). The first dimension of the ordination was found to be strongly associated with transparency, water level, seston and also fish predation (FISH). Transparency and water level increased from the left (negative) to the right (positive) side of the diagram, while the opposite gradient was observed in seston and predatory pressure. A similar, but weaker, association was also recorded for temperature, TP, TN, chl a and pH, with these variables decreasing from the left to the right side of the biplot. Thus, DCA identified a clear association between high transparency (low seston), high water level, and reduced fish predation and a zooplankton assemblage with the presence of calanoid copepods, Simocephalus, Graptoleberis, and Daphnia (Figure 1.5). An assemblage characterised by the presence of Bosmina and, especially, Moina and Macrothrix was associated with low transparency (high seston), low water level and high fish predation (Figure 1.5). The second DCA dimension was less important to the ordination and its variation was mostly attributable to seasonal\nfluctuations in daylight duration and, to a lesser extent, temperature, conductivity and chl a (Table 1.5). Thus, taxa on the negative side of the axis (bottom) were most abundant during spring and/or summer, while taxa with positive scores (top) were mainly present in autumn and/or winter months (Figure 1.5). Chydorus, cyclopoid copepods and nauplii scored in the central zone of the diagram, apparently unaffected by the environmental framework of the lake (Figure 1.5).\n\u00a1V Diap\nAlon\nV\nV\nLeyd\nGrap\nV\nCala\nV\nSimo\nV\nB/xsm\nL\nChyd\nV\nCycl\nNaup\nMacc\nV\nMoin\nDaph\n[ V Ceri\n-4\nDCA axis 1 (l = 0.180)\n5\nFigure 1.5 \u2022 DCA ordination biplot of species scores (total inertia = 0.456).

On one hand, no significant relationships (linear regression, P > 0.05) were found between FISH and the densities of adult copepods, nauplli or small-sized cladocerans (Alona, Bosmina, Ceriodaphnia and Chydorus). On the other hand, FISH could explain 29% and 36% of the variation in the densities of Moina (linear regression: F1,24 = 11; P = 0.003) and Daphnia (linear regression: F1,24 = 15; P = 0.001), respectively.\nTable 1.5 \u2022 Correlation (Pearson\u2019s r) between environmental variables (in alphabetical order) and sample scores for each DCA dimension.

Fish pressure (as seen above), chl a and temperature also contributed significantly to the total variation (the 4 variables together explained 65% of the variance in Daphnia density). In addition, Daphnia densities were positively correlated to transparency (Secchi depth) (r = 0.776; P = 0.000), enhancing their role as grazers and as evidenced in the DCA diagram (Figure 1.5). We sought additional insight on the body size distribution and reproductive condition of the Daphnia population during the study period (Figure 1.6). Due to the low densities or absence of D. longispina from mid-July to December, no data were available for this period. Figure 1.6 (A-C) shows the minimum, maximum and average body size of Daphnia in the pelagial and macrophyte sites. The pattern was similar for both sites: the period from May to July was more constant in terms of body size, while the period from December to May exhibited larger fluctuations. Additionally, and more important, daphnids from May-July were smaller that those from December-May, which was especially noticeable on the maximum body sizes recorded (see Figures 1.6 A-B).\nSimple regressions Predictors\tSlope\t2 r\tP\nSeston (log)\t-1.75\t0.49\t0.000\nFISH\t-0.38\t0.36\t0.000\nChl a (log)\t-1.41\t0.22\t0.000\nTP (log)\t-2.60\t0.19\t0.001\nTemperature (log)\t-2.72\t0.17\t0.001\nCDOC (log)\t3.83\t0.14\t0.004\nTN (log)\t-2.04\t0.11\t0.013\nStepwise multiple regression\t\t\t\nOrder entered Predictors\t\t\t2 r\n1\tSeston (log)\t\t\t0.49\n2\tChl a (log)\t\t\t0.52\n3\tFISH\t\t\t0.57\n4\tTemperature (log)\t\t\t0.65\nFigure 1.6 \u2022 Minimum (Min), maximum (Max) and average body size of Daphnia longispina recorded during the study period, at a macrophyte (A) and a pelagial (B) site in Lake Vela. For comparative purposes, the average body size (with respective SD) for both sites is also plotted together (C). Proportion of eggbearing Daphnia females observed during the study period at a macrophyte (D) and a pelagial (E) site in Lake Vela. For comparative purposes, the total proportion of ovigerous females in both sites is also represented together (F). The discontinuity in the plots is due to low densities or absence of Daphnia from mid-July to December.\nThese observations lead us to look at these periods separately, an approach also supported by the fact that these two Daphnia peaks (see Figure 1.4) occurred under distinct\ntransparency conditions (see Figures 1.2 and 1.4). Statistically, our interpretation on body size was supported by a significant effect of period (May-July versus December-May), which was independent of site (i.e., no significant period x site interaction; Table 1.7). This was true not only for maximum body size, but also for minimum and average body size, which were all found to be higher in December-May (Table 1.7). No differences in body size were found between sites (Table 1.7; Figure 1.6 C). Consistent with these results, an almost two-fold increase in size at maturity (SAM) was found from May-July to December-May, for both sites (Figure 1.7). The difference in adult body size between the two periods was so pronounced that the size distributions of ovigerous females barely overlapped (Figure 1.7). A significant site-independent effect of period was also obtained for the proportion of ovigerous females (Table 1.7). As seen in Figure 1.6 (D-E), a significant lower proportion of (subitaneous) egg-bearing females was recorded in December-May, comparatively to May-July. The large peak observed in March 6th represented an exception to this general pattern. Contrarily to the egg-bearing females, a significantly larger proportion of ephippium-bearing females occurred in December-May, when compared to May-July (Table 1.7; Figure 1.6). In both cases (egg- or ephippium-bearing females), no differences were found between sites (Table 1.7; Figure 1.6 F). Again, as for the body size data, the proportion of ovigerous females seemed to be more prone to fluctuations in the December-May period (Figure 1.6 D-E).\nFigure 1.7 \u2022 Body size distribution of ovigerous Daphnia longispina at two different locations (macrophyte and pelagial) in Lake Vela and in two distinct periods (May-July and December-May).

The present study provides evidence of the present ecological condition of this small polymictic lake, which sustains a considerable amount of aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. According to Wetzel (1983), Lake Vela can be viewed as eutrophic or hypereutrophic, concerning TN (annual average = 2200 mg m-3), TP (180 mg m-3), chlorophyll a (100 mg m-3) and transparency (0.5 m) values. Correspondingly, Carlson's trophic state index (Carlson, 1977) was high for TP (range: 70-87), chlorophyll a (60-84) and transparency (58-87). Due to high nutrient availability, phytoplankton was chiefly top-down controlled (by grazers), as revealed by the absence of a significant TP-chl a relationship. The water from Lake Vela was also highly coloured (high CDOC) and, according to the model proposed by Williamson et al. (1999), it should be viewed as mixotrophic, as it is subjected to high amounts of nutrients (N and P) but also to allochthonous organic compounds, such as humic substances (Wetzel, 1983). High turbidity was also observed and the levels of suspended particles (seston) were found to be important to the overall response of the lake's limnology and zooplankton assemblage (see below).\nThe seasonal pattern observed for the zooplankton of Lake Vela was clearly associated with water level, seston and transparency, but also with fish predation pressure. In late spring / early summer (May-July), a Bosmina-Chydorus-Daphnia-Ceriodaphnia assemblage was recorded, under high seston, moderate predatory pressure from fish and progressively increasing chlorophyll a levels. During this period, Daphnia exhibited small body sizes and reduced SAM, which is concordant with size-selective predation from fish (Tessier et al., 1992; Gliwicz, 1994; Caramujo et al., 1997). Summer and fall represented a shift towards progressively smaller species, from a Bosmina-Moina (August-September) to a Bosmina-Chydorus (October-December) assemblage. During this high predation period, Daphnia was virtually absent and chlorophyll a levels were always high. We can not rule out the additional influence of other factors (such as cyanobacteria) in the summer absence of Daphnia, as suggested in the literature (Sommer et al., 1986; Abrantes et al., 2006a). As predatory pressure dropped with decreasing winter temperatures and seston was reduced due to an increase in water level, Daphnia populations reappeared and became dominant from January onwards, inducing a transient clear water phase (with the contribution of macrophyte-associated species, such as Simocephalus') and suppressing small-sized species, as predicted by the size-efficiency hypothesis (Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965; Hall et al., 1976). Compared to the May-July period, Daphnia exhibited larger body sizes and higher densities during late winter and early spring, but a lower proportion of egg-bearing females and a greater number of ephippium-carrying females. These features can be attributed to inter-specific competition for resources, as shown by significant resourcedependence (chlorophyll a vs. density, chlorophyll a vs. proportion of ovigerous females) and density-dependence relationships (density vs. proportion of ephippial females). In fact, when comparing both periods in terms of Daphnia body size and proportion of ovigerous females, it seems evident that the clear water period was more prone to fluctuations, probably as the result of more unstable (i.e. limiting) environmental conditions, particularly food. Absolute chlorophyll a levels suggest food is not a limiting factor in Lake Vela, but it is nevertheless true that chlorophyll a exhibited large fluctuations during the clear water phase, reaching its lowest values in the whole sampling period (in February and again in March). Similar outcomes, illustrating the role of food shortage in the Daphnia spring peak and fish predation in the summer have been widely reported in the\nliterature, even in eutrophic conditions (Mills &amp; Forney, 1983; Luecke et al., 1990; Boersma et al., 1996; Hulsmann, 2003).\nTransparency was chiefly dependent on the reduction of seston, which, in turn, was dependent on water level rise (see regression analyses). In shallow lakes, winds cause substantial mixing in the water column (polymixis) and enhance sediment-water column interaction (Scheffer, 1998), a phenomenon intensified at low water. In these conditions, sediment resuspension easily occurs by wave and wind action, and is facilitated by benthivorous fish (Breukelaar et al., 1994; Scheffer et al., 2003), such as carp. Two additional reasons make Lake Vela especially subjected to high levels of suspended materials: i) the lakebed is coated by a thick layer of fine and easily-resuspended organic particles (Fernandes, 1999); ii) due to the slope of the piezometric surface towards the lake depression, most of its water drains from superficial fluxes (Fernandes, 1999; Abrantes et al., 2006b), which carry many dissolved and suspended materials from the surrounding area. However, the reduction of seston was insufficient to explain the transient spring clear water phase. Although seston displayed low levels from November onwards, the highest transparency values were only observed at high Daphnia densities (> 100 ind L-1), which were recorded later, between February and April. To some extent, D. longispina also contributed to increased transparency by grazing on phytoplankton, as supported by the significant relationship between Daphnia density and chl a, and the two chl a minima observed in February and March. However, this control over zooplankton was irregular (see Figure 1.2), and large fluctuations in chl a may explain the low association between chl a and transparency. Lampert et al. (1986) have stressed out the role of grazers in the occurrence of clear water phases in eutrophic lakes, and have recognised that the increase in water clarity can occur just for a few days, in a transient and irregular pattern.\nRegression analysis revealed that seston was the main driver of the Daphnia population, while fish predation contributed less, along with chl a and temperature. However, the dummy variable FISH was also correlated to seston (r = 0.74; P = 0.000). We therefore expect some bias in the regression. Nevertheless, Rellstab &amp; Spaak (2007) observed detrimental effects in the fitness of D. hyalina exposed to concentrations of suspended particles above 25 mg L-1. Seston in Lake Vela exceeded this level from May to November, when the Daphnia population was reduced to low levels or absent. However, other evidences (e.g. reduction in SAM, replacement of Daphnia by smaller cladocerans)\nseemed to point out to a top-down regulation of Daphnia by fish. Both factors may have contributed to the summer disappearance of Daphnia until its winter/spring peak. Further research is necessary to unveil the timing and relative contribution of seston and fish predation to the zooplankton dynamics in lakes exhibiting high turbidity. We emphasize that a clear water condition as the one shown in this study is not always observed in Lake Vela.\nA few differences were observed between the seasonal succession pattern of Lake Vela and the one described by the PEG group (Sommer et al., 1986), which is widely accepted as the norm in northern temperate lakes. First, re-suspended particles contributed significantly to the zooplankton dynamics, although its interaction with fish predation must be clarified. Qualitatively, the sequence of mechanisms determining grazer abundance and community structure was similar, but different timings were perceptible. Abiotic factors (temperature or food shortage) did not suppress Daphnia populations during the winter. On the contrary, temperature presumably released large grazers from planktivory, allowing the formation of a winter/spring Daphnia-dominance phase until the advent of predation. Fish predation in Lake Vela seemed to be more prolonged in time than predicted in the PEG model, extending its influence from late spring to early winter. Large shoals of YOY pumpkinseed were present in September and October and their overall activity was not diminished by the mild autumnal temperatures, thus extending their temporal influence on zooplankton.\nThe prolonged importance of fish predation and the reduced role of abiotic constraints in the winter have already been stressed out by Saunders et al. (1999), who discussed this in the light of the pattern they observed in Lake Oglethorpe (U.S.A.) and other cases reported in the literature. They concluded that predator influence was much higher in warmer lakes, when comparing studies performed above (1-2 months year-1) and below 40\u00b0 latitude (3-7 months year-1). Although Lake Vela (40\u00b0 5' N) is geographically more close to the northern cluster of lakes, its alien fish community and high levels of suspended particles pose serious constraints to zooplankton, particularly to large grazers, such as Daphnia. Suspended particles pose an additional problem, as they also represent an additional source of P and N to phytoplanktonic production. The large influence of fish predation and suspended particles on zooplankton and transparency must be taken into account in order to promote adequate restoration programs in Lake Vela.\nREFERENCES\nAbrantes N., Antunes S.C., Pereira M.J. &amp; Gon\u00e7alves F.

Understanding the success of alien fish in an Iberian shallow lake: recruitment patterns and feeding ecology.\nResumo\nO objectivo do presente trabalho foi o de estudar a din\u00e2mica populacional e a ecologia alimentar da comunidade de peixes alien\u00edgenas da Lagoa da Vela, um lago pouco profundo que se apresenta muito turvo, eutr\u00f3fico e em perda de biodiversidade. Os principais taxa alien\u00edgenas (achig\u00e3 - Micropterus salmoides, perca-sol - Lepomis gibbosus, e gamb\u00fazia - Gambusia holbrooki), que substitu\u00edram completamente a comunidade de ciprin\u00eddeos ind\u00edgena, exercem uma forte press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria sobre os n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos mais baixos. A amostragem foi conduzida mensalmente utilizando uma combina\u00e7\u00e3o de pesca el\u00e9ctrica e redes de pesca (rede de m\u00e3o e rede de cerco), durante a \u00e9poca de crescimento (Abril a Outubro). Adicionalmente, procedeu-se a uma campanha de amostragem adicional, em Janeiro, para complementar os dados da dieta. A ictiocenose da Lagoa da Vela revelou ser pouco diversificada e dominada por elevada abund\u00e2ncia de peixes alien\u00edgenas de pequenas dimens\u00f5es (perca-sol e gamb\u00fazia), exibindo recrutamento mais ou menos cont\u00ednuo durante todo o ver\u00e3o. O achig\u00e3, a \u00fanica esp\u00e9cie pisc\u00edvora, desovou na primavera e os seus primeiros recrutas foram observados no in\u00edcio de Maio, crescendo rapidamente at\u00e9 Setembro. Foi observada uma mudan\u00e7a ontogen\u00e9tica radical na sua dieta, sendo os esp\u00e9cimes de menores dimens\u00f5es (TL &lt;50 mm) essencialmente planct\u00edvoros, ao passo que os indiv\u00edduos maiores se tornaram pisc\u00edvoros especializados. Infelizmente, o n\u00famero de exemplares capturados foi demasiado pequeno para conclus\u00f5es robustas. O zoopl\u00e2ncton foi uma categoria alimentar muito importante para a gamb\u00fazia e para a perca-sol (especialmente para os exemplares mais pequenos), apesar da sua dieta poder ser caracterizada como omn\u00edvora, dada a sua capacidade para explorar diferentes tipos de presas (sobretudo larvas, ninfas, pupas e imagos de insectos) de acordo com a ocorr\u00eancia sazonal. A perca-sol passou por uma mudan\u00e7a de h\u00e1bitos alimentares progressiva, que foi menos pronunciada na gamb\u00fazia. A componente b\u00eantica (i.e. macroinvertebrados) foi bastante menos importante para estas esp\u00e9cies de peixes do que noutras popula\u00e7\u00f5es ib\u00e9ricas, provavelmente por causa do reduzido coberto de macr\u00f3fitas da Lagoa da Vela. Ainda assim, a sobreposi\u00e7\u00e3o diet\u00e1ria entre as tr\u00eas esp\u00e9cies foi globalmente baixa, o que poder\u00e1 ser uma das raz\u00f5es do sucesso e coexist\u00eancia de popula\u00e7\u00f5es t\u00e3o densas (sobretudo gamb\u00fazia e perca-sol).\nPalavras-chave\nRecrutamento, an\u00e1lise da dieta, peixes alien\u00edgenas, lago Mediterr\u00e2nico pouco profundo\nO presente cap\u00edtulo constitui um manuscrito submetido para publica\u00e7\u00e3o em revista internacional com arbitragem cient\u00edfica e \u00e9, por esse motivo, apresentado na l\u00edngua inglesa.\nAbstract\nThe aim of this work was to study the population dynamics and feeding ecology of the alien fish assemblage of Lake Vela, a turbid shallow lake facing eutrophication and biodiversity loss. Main alien taxa (largemouth bass - Micropterus salmoides, pumpkinseed sunfish - Lepomis gibbosus and mosquitofish - Gambusia holbrooki) exert strong top-down effects on lower trophic levels and have completely replaced the native cyprinid assemblage. Fish were sampled every month using a combination of electrofishing and fish nets (dip and seine nets), during the growing season (April-October). Additional sampling took place in January to complement diet data. The fish community of Lake Vela was poorly diversified and dominated by very high numbers of small-sized alien fish (pumpkinseed and mosquitofish), displaying more or less continuous recruitment during the summer. Largemouth bass, the only piscivore species, spawned in spring and its first recruits were observed in early May, rapidly growing until September. A radical ontogenetic diet shift was observed in bass, with smaller specimens (TL &lt;50 mm) being essentially zooplanktivorous, while larger individuals became specialised piscivores, although this evidence is hampered by small sample size. Zooplankton was a very important food category for mosquitofish and pumpkinseed (especially smaller specimens), although their diet could be classified as omnivorous, since they explored several types of prey (chiefly insect larvae, nymphs, pupae and adults) according to their seasonal occurrence. Pumpkinseed experienced a progressive ontogenetic diet shift, which was much less pronounced in mosquitofish. The benthic niche (i.e. macroinvertebrates) was less important for all taxa than reported for other Iberian populations, probably because of low macrophyte coverage in Lake Vela. Still, diet overlap between the three taxa was low overall, which may be one of the reasons for the success and coexistence of such dense populations (particularly pumpkinseed and mosquitofish).\nKEYWORDS\nRecruitment, diet analysis, alien fish, Mediterranean shallow lake\nIntroduction\nIn southern Europe, the cyprinid zone (impoundments, lakes and low reaches of rivers) has been extremely vulnerable to alien fish species introduction (Almaga, 1995a). In Iberia, adventive species gradually formed well-established populations, with a variable degree of invasiveness, displacing the autochthonous cyprinids and contributing to biotic homogenisation (Almaga, 1995a; 1995b; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1998b; 2000; Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Blanco et al., 2003). This has not been subject of enough\nattention from local authorities and populations, and the high degree of endemism of the Iberian fish fauna has been particularly neglected. According to Almaga (1995b), the successive introduction of alien species is the most serious conservation problem for Portuguese endemics. Inhabitants of inland waters include endemic omnivorous cyprinids from the genera Barbus, Chondrostoma and Squalius (formerly placed under Leuciscus), but also an array of introduced species, including widespread invaders such as pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus (L.)), mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki (Girard)) carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) and largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede)).\nAccording to Almaga (1995a), one of the reasons for the success of alien species in Iberia is the absence of naturally-occurring predator fish in the indigenous freshwater fauna. This feature is in contrast with the piscivore-planktivore cascade of northern temperate lakes and may contribute to facilitating the establishment of invasive taxa at the expenses of indigenous species. Additionally, and depending on the case, the competitive capabilities and phenotypic plasticity of alien invasive species, in terms of resource exploitation and/or reproductive strategy, also account for their extraordinary success away from their original environment. Increased knowledge on the ecology and life-history of alien species in homogenised habitats (or where homogenisation is in progress) is therefore urgently needed.\nWith few exceptions (e.g. Blanco et al., 2003), most studies on the ecology of alien species in the Iberian Peninsula have neglected shallow lakes, focusing mainly on deep lakes, large reservoirs, or streams (Fernandez-Delgado, 1989; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1998a; 1998b; Cabral &amp; Marques, 1999; Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Vila-Gispert &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 2000; Garcia-Berthou, 2002). Although rare in Iberia, shallow lakes constitute important pools of biodiversity, sustaining associated wildlife and providing unique ecological niches. However, these habitats usually face the threat of eutrophication and terrestrialisation, requiring adequate management. Their small dimensions, island-like nature and trophic status make shallow lakes ideal subjects for lake restoration programs (including fish manipulation with reintroduction of native species).\nBearing this in mind, we conducted a survey on the ichthyocenosis of a shallow polymictic lake (Lake Vela), which is facing eutrophication and biodiversity loss (due to homogenisation of the fish fauna). The main goals of this study were: 1) to evaluate the\ncurrent status of the fish assemblage of Lake Vela and to assess its recent evolution by comparing it to the records of a previous work (see below; Ferreira, 1997); 2) to study the population dynamics of the main species (L. gibbosus, G. holbrooki and M. salmoides) and, more specifically, their recruitment patterns; 3) to assess the general feeding preferences (feeding strategy and prey importance) of the three alien fish, as well as underlying patterns in diet variation. Our attention was mainly focused on the alien planktivores because of their key role on the top-down regulation of the trophic cascade (e.g. Christofferson et al., 1993; Williams &amp; Moss, 2003; Tatrai et al., 2003a; 2003b; Blanco et al., 2004), especially juvenile fish (Romare et al., 1999).\nMaterials and methods\nStudy site\nLake Vela is one of the few natural shallow lakes (average depth circa 1 m) existing in Portugal, being the largest (60-70 ha) of a cluster of small shallow lakes located within a coastal dune system (Quiaios, Portugal). Agriculture, livestock activities and, to a lesser extent, domestic runoffs from adjacent human settlements supply regular nutrient inputs to the lake, originating high primary productivity and turbidity. Occasional fish kills due to transient anoxic stress have occurred in recent years (for details, see Antunes et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2006). Continuous introductions of alien fish species have contributed to a loss of diversity in the ichthyocenosis, which has been aggravated since the invasion of pumpkinseed in the late 1990s (Jos\u00e9 Vingada, unpublished data). The only study (Ferreira, 1997) on the fish community of Lake Vela was conducted in 1993/94 and it already reported dominance of alien species (mainly G. holbrooki and M. salmoides) and low diversity (a total of eight taxa were observed). Nonetheless, the presence of indigenous taxa, such as Cobitis sp. (frequent), Anguilla anguilla and Atherina boyeri (rare), was still reported. Tench (Tinca tinca) was also observed, although it is still unclear whether this species is part of the indigenous Portuguese ichthyofauna (Almaga, 1995a).\nSampling procedures\nFish were collected monthly from April to October 2003 as a pooled sample from (at least) two different sampling points in Lake Vela. An additional sampling campaign was carried out in January 2004 (for collection of additional gut content data - see below).\nA combination of seine nets and electrofishing (using portable gear and dip nets) was used, covering both open-water and vegetated areas, with an approximate constant sampling effort. The joint use of such methods underestimates the abundance of large evasive fish but it is particularly useful in collecting the smallest specimens (namely new recruits), particularly in structured environments (near the shore and in macrophyte beds). Eel (A. anguilla) was particularly evasive because of its burying abilities and greater resistance to the electric pulse. All captured fish were sorted by taxon and immediately stored on ice, and later frozen.\nIn the laboratory, all individuals were counted and weighed (as a pooled sample), after thawing. Length measurements (TL) were performed in M. salmoides, G. holbrooki and L. gibbosus specimens, with a precision of 0.5 mm. Sexual differentiation was only carried out for G. holbrooki (juveniles, males and females), based on external sexual dimorphism (anal fin morphology). Because it is difficult to distinguish between undifferentiated juveniles and small-sized females, we used 18 mm as the cut-off value between juvenile (TL &lt;18 mm) and female mosquitofish (Cabral &amp; Marques, 1999; Garcia-Berthou, 1999). An initial subsample of 50 specimens (or all, if n &lt;50) for each combination of month and species was selected for diet analysis (see below), comprehending all possible size classes (centrarchids: &lt;50 mm, 50-100 mm and > 100 mm; mosquitofish: &lt;20 mm, 20-40 mm and > 40 mm). These specimens were eviscerated and non-empty stomachs (centrarchids) or guts (mosquitofish) were preserved in 70% ethanol, until further processing was possible. Since mosquitofish lack a distinctive and individualised stomach, unlike pumpkinseed and largemouth bass, the anterior third of the gut was excised (Cabral et al., 1998).\nFor diet analysis, observations focused only on non-empty stomachs in which most food categories could be clearly identified (proportion of digested material &lt;50% total stomach content volume) to minimise bias from differential digestion of prey items (Hyslop, 1980; Amundsen et al., 1996). For bass, all stomachs were analysed, while a total of 25 stomachs were analysed in average - per month - for mosquitofish and pumpkinseed, except where impossible. Gut contents were examined under a dissecting microscope, where prey items were usually sorted to genus or family level. Prey abundance was determined by counting each food item, using subsampling if necessary (especially for microinvertebrates), while prey volume (relative to total stomach content\nData analysis\nSize structure of the main fish taxa was analysed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess seasonal and sexual (only in mosquitofish) variation in fish length. We tested for trends (linear trend contrasts) in fish length across months using orthogonal polynomials (Quinn &amp; Keough, 2002). Additional planned contrasts and treatment-contrast interactions (Quinn &amp; Keough, 2002) were used to explore interactions between main factors, when applicable. Fish length was log-transformed when this improved homoscedascity and linearity. A C test was used to test for independence between sex ratio and sampling month in mosquitofish.\nPrey-specific abundance (sensu Amundsen et al., 1996) and frequency of occurrence (FO) were used to estimate the dietary importance of each food category. For prey i, prey-specific abundance (%) is the number of individuals or volume of prey i divided by the total number or volume of all prey items in predators who have ingested prey i. Correspondingly, FO corresponds to the proportion of stomachs containing prey i (relative to the total number of examined stomachs). These parameters were used to describe feeding strategy for each fish species using the graphical method of Amundsen et al. (1996), which is a modification from the Costello (1990) method. The former method has corrected some of the drawbacks of Costello\u2019s bi-dimensional diagrams concerning the feeding strategy of predators, by using prey-specific abundance instead of percent abundance (sensu Hyslop, 1980 and Costello, 1990), because the latter measure underestimates the importance of variation in resource use among individuals of the population. Thus, feeding strategy analysis according to Amundsen et al. (1996) provides an analytical approach to assessing dietary niche width components: a) within-phenotype component, which concerns variation in resource use within each individual (e.g. broad diet vs. preferential prey); b) between-phenotype component, which concerns variation in resource use between individuals of the same population (e.g. large vs. small fish). Information on (absolute) percent abundance can also be represented in the feeding\nstrategy diagrams as isolines, resulting from the product between frequency of occurrence and prey-specific abundance (see Amundsen et al., 1996).\nDetrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was applied to relative abundance data (excluding rare food categories) in order to describe the main sources of diet variation, using each fish (stomach) as a sampling unit. DCA is an improved eigenvector ordination technique based on reciprocal (weighted) averaging (Gauch, 1982; ter Braak, 1995). This family of techniques is commonly used in community ecology (Gauch, 1982; ter Braak, 1995) and also for dietary data (Godinho et al., 1997; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1998a; 1998b; Garda-Berthou, 1999; Garc\u00eda-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 2001;\n2002). Its purpose is to reduce a species (food category) x sample (fish) matrix to a few dimensions (the eigenvectors) that explain the highest proportion of total variation in the data, without a priori pooling food categories, size classes or explanatory factors. Similar food categories are thus grouped based on common occurrence and the ordination can be interpreted with external data (see ter Braak, 1995). In this study, the ordination axes were interpreted in terms of the potential sources of variation of the samples (fish length, sampling month and sex), by analysing the sample (fish) scores with correlation analysis and ANCOVA (using log fish length as the covariate). Additionally, the direction of maximum correlation between fish length and the first two ordination axes was determined by multiple regression of (log) fish length on the fish scores of the first two dimensions (ter Braak, 1995). The graphical output is an arrow beginning at the centroid of the plot and whose relative length is proportional to the importance of fish length (ontogeny) in the ordination diagram.\nMean relative abundance and mean relative volume of the main food categories were analysed with ANCOVA (using fish length as covariate) in order to assess the significance of fish length (ontogenic component) and sampling month (seasonal component) in diet variation. Mean relative abundance and volume were arcsine squareroot (arcsin Vx) transformed and fish length was log-transformed to improve homoscedascity and linearity. ANCOVA's homogeneity of slopes assumption was verified by graphical analysis and by testing the interaction between factor (month) and covariate (fish length) under a full model (Quinn &amp; Keough, 2002).\nFor descriptive purposes, diet overlap was estimated for all combinations of species and functional groups (length classes) in each month, using a simple algorithm for overlap similarity (Schoener, 1968; Abrams, 1980):\na = 1 -0.5 \u2022\tpia -pa\\,\nwhere a is overlap similarity - Schoener's (1968) index of overlap - between species/functional groups a and b, while pia and pib represent the proportion of resource i relatively to the total resources used by species/functional groups a and b, respectively. The index varies between 0 (no overlap) and 1, and values greater than 0.6 are considered biologically significant (Wallace, 1981).\nResults\nIchthyocenosis status and size structure\nA total of 5063 specimens were caught from April to October, heterogeneously distributed in five taxa: Lepomis gibbosus (introduced), Gambusia holbrooki (introduced), Micropterus salmoides (introduced), Cyprinus carpio (introduced) and Atherina sp. (native). Eel (Anguilla anguilla) was also reported in the area by fishermen, but no specimens were caught in this study due to avoidance of fishing gear (see Materials and Methods). In January, additional 110 specimens (48 L. gibbosus and 62 G. holbrooki) were caught for gut content analysis data. The ichthyocenosis of Lake Vela was markedly dominated by pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus) and mosquitofish (G. holbrooki) in terms of abundance, with pumpkinseed being dominant in terms of biomass (Figure 2.1). Nearly half of the captured specimens (2417) were YOY pumpkinseeds collected in October, when they were highly abundant near the shore. YOY largemouth bass were well represented during their growing season (May-September), while only two YOY carps were caught in August. Sand smelt (Atherina sp.) was present from August to September. Because large specimens (> 200 mm) of bass and carp were captured only sporadically throughout the sampling period, they were not taken into account in abundance and biomass estimates (Figure 2.1). On-site direct observation showed that occasional capture of larger specimens occurred in unstructured areas (pelagic), but most fish were caught in or nearby structured habitats. Mosquitofish, in particular, was extremely abundant near the shoreline (in very shallow water), amidst terrestrial vegetation and aquatic macrophytes.\nFigure 2.1 \u2022 Monthly variation in abundance (top) and biomass (bottom) of the fish species captured in Lake\nVela.\nMean size of largemouth bass varied seasonally (1-way ANOVA: F4,36 = 134, P = 0.000), increasing monotonically from May to September (linear trend contrast: F1,36 = 403, P = 0.000). This species spawned in April (visual confirmation) and the first recruits were observed in early May. This synchronised new cohort exhibited fast growth and, by the end of the summer, most captured specimens were already above 100 mm (Figure 2.2).\nIn April, pumpkinseed showed a bimodal size structure, with the younger cohort progressively shifting the population\u2019s mode to the left as they grew, from April to June. We observed nest-protection behaviour in late spring (May-June) and recruitment was continuously recorded from July to October (Figure 2.2). A progressive disappearance of larger size classes was recorded and, by the end of the summer, only YOY pumpkinseeds were caught (in high numbers near the shore). Consequently, mean size of pumpkinseed varied significantly between months (1-way ANOVA: F6,1531 = 5 5 8, P = 0.000), decreasing monotonically from April to October (linear trend contrast: F1,1531 = 2174, P = 0.000).\nFigure 2.2 \u2022 Size structure of the most abundant fish species of Lake Vela, by month and by sex (only for G. holbrooki).\nThe larger portion of variance in mosquitofish length variation was due to sex (2way ANOVA: F2,1518 = 428, P = 0.000), with female mosquitofish being overall larger than males (Figure 2.2). Seasonal variation in size structure was also recorded (F6,i5i8 = 17.7, P\n= 0.000), but it was found to be sex-dependent (month x sex interaction: F12,1518 = 23.7, P = 0.000). Sexual dimorphism was shown to vary between months (male vs. female contrast x month interaction: F1,1518 = 60.6, P = 0.000) and linear trends in fish length were also found to vary with sex (male vs. female contrast x linear trend contrast: F1,1518 = 60.6, P = 0.000). The number of females was always higher than males (mean approximate ratio 3$ : 1 J), but the absolute sex ratio (n\u00b0 females/n\u00b0 males) varied significantly with month (test of independence: %26 = 31.8, P = 0.000), ranging from 1.75 (in May) to 6.86 (in April). Length-frequency histograms (Figure 2.2) revealed two recruitment periods (May-June and August-September), with a midsummer interval (July). This interval denoted cohort substitution, as the parental generation (larger fish) disappeared from July onwards and the new cohort (born in May) reproduced later in the summer.\nLargemouth bass diet\nOnly 45 stomachs were analysed, comprising 6450 prey items. Overall, the most important food category for largemouth bass was zooplankton (see Figure 2.3), namely Chydorus but also Copepoda, Bosmina and Daphnia, followed by fish. Adult insects and larvae were less important (FO &lt;0.3), although in some cases giving a large contribution in terms of volume. A clear dichotomy was observable in the diet of bass (between-phenotype component of niche width), with a specialisation either on zooplankton or on fish (Figure 2.3). This dichotomy was directly related to fish length, given the clear ontogenetic shift observed (Figure 2.4), with smaller specimens (TL &lt;40 mm) being essentially zooplanktivorous and later becoming exclusive piscivores (TL > 60 mm). Adult insects and nymphs became important food categories in the transition between planktivory and piscivory. Piscivory in the sampled size classes of bass was almost exclusively centred on mosquitofish, the only exceptions being specimens beyond recognition due to digestion. Due to the low number of fish sampled and their rapid growth, any statistical analysis on seasonal and ontogenetic components of diet variation in largemouth bass would be biased. Still, when conjugating size structure (Figure 2.2) and ontogenetic variation in diet (Figure 2.4), it is possible to infer that planktivory in bass was intensive in May (and also July), while piscivory became important from August onwards.\n100\n\u25a0o\nM. salmoides\nL. gibbosus\nG. holbrooki\nbosmina V\n80\n75%\nfish eggs\n60\nbosmina\nS 50%\n40\n25%\n20\n5%\n80\nzooplankton\n75%\n60\n50%\nzooplankton\n40\n25%\n20\n5%\n\u25bc acari\n0\no\no\n\u00d4\no\n>\no\nu O> Q.\n(fl\nO>\n\u00a3\n0\n100\nchydorus V\nu O> Q. \u00a3 O> \u00a3\no\nE\nephemV z/gopterk \u2019 \u25bcdiptera'-corixidae\nV diptera larvae\niptei^ pupae for^icidae\n1\nephemer.\n^cdrixidae dipteraJarvae d^ter^mago insectajmago\n\\\n\u25bc collembola X.\nFrequency of occurrence\nFigure 2.3 \u2022 Feeding strategy diagrams (according to Amundsen et al., 1996) for M. salmoides (n = 45), L. gibbosus (n = 201) and G. holbrooki (n = 195).

Data are presented as the proportion (%) of total number of prey (top panel) and stomach content volume (bottom panel), averaged for 10 mm (fish &lt;60 mm) and 20 mm (fish > 60 mm) length classes of bass.\nPumpkinseed diet\nA total of 201 stomachs were analysed, distributed over 8 months and comprising 39 781 prey items. The most important food categories in pumpkinseed diet were, by far, zooplankton (especially copepods and Bosmina} and diptera larvae (Figure 2.3). The former gave a larger contribution in terms of abundance, while the latter were most relevant in terms of relative volume. Both categories were frequently found in pumpkinseed stomachs (FO > 0.8). Insect nymphs (particularly ephemeroptera) and diptera pupae were also of some importance in pumpkinseed diet, especially in terms of volume (Figure 2.3). Pumpkinseeds were mainly generalist (opportunistic) predators, with each individual profiting from a wide range of prey (i.e. reasonable within-phenotype component of niche width). The only exception to this generalist strategy was the high relative importance of large prey (odonata anisoptera nymphs and fish) and fish eggs, which was verified in a small percentage of individuals (FO &lt;0.05). This suggests some degree of feeding variation among individuals, as shown below.\nThe first two DCA axes were significantly correlated to fish length (axis 1: r = -0.493, P = 0.000; axis 2: r = 0.388, P = 0.000) and the direction of maximum correlation between the axes and fish length is shown in the diagram (Figure 2.5). This length gradient (arrow in biplot) demonstrated an ontogenetic diet shift in the diet of pumpkinseeds. Thus, smaller pumpkinseed fed mainly on small planktonic invertebrates (opposite direction to arrow), while larger pumpkinseed preferred larger prey, namely benthic macroinvertebrates and fish eggs (Figure 2.5). Besides ontogeny, there was also a seasonal component in diet variation, reflected in a significant effect of sampling month on fish scores of axis 1 (ANCOVA on month: F7,191 = 23.9, P = 0.000) and axis 2 (ANCOVA on month: F7,191 = 51.0, P = 0.000). As expected, fish length (covariate) was also significant for both axes (axis 1: F1,191 = 57.7, P = 0.000; axis 2: F1,191 = 97.0, P = 0.000), providing a larger contribution than month to the total variance of the models. Mean fish scores by month (Figure 2.5) showed some association with particular prey types which occurred in high abundances only in some months, such as Daphnia (April and January), Alona (May), Bosmina (October). August occupied a position relatively far from the centroid of the plot (arrow origin) due to the reduced planktivory observed during this month.\nDCA axis 1 (l = 0.585)\tDCA axis 1 (l = 0.726)\nFigure 2.5 \u2022 Detrended correspondence analyses (DCA) of gut contents (prey relative abundance) of pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus - left) and mosquitofish (G. holbrooki - right). Prey category scores (\u2022), mean fish scores by month (X), and mean fish scores by sex (only for mosquitofish: M, F and juvenile, in grey symbols) are shown for the first two ordination axes. Arrows begin at the centroid of the plot and represent the direction of maximum correlation between (log) fish length and the first two dimensions, for each fish species.\nThese evidences on diet variation were corroborated by analysing the main (pooled) food categories of pumpkinseed (see Figure 2.6 and Table 2.1). Figure 2.6 shows that zooplankton importance varied seasonally (e.g. reduced planktivory in August) and that smaller fish were more dependent on zooplankton, but the effects of month and fish length were not independent (significant interaction under full ANCOVA model, P &lt;0.001). Seasonal and ontogenetic variations in fish egg consumption were also observed, as this was only verified for fish TL > 100 mm and restricted from April to June. Again, however, these effects were statistically inter-dependent (significant interaction under full ANCOVA model, P = 0.001). The use of all other food categories varied seasonally and increased significantly with fish length (either in volume, abundance or both - see Table 2.1), except for insect larvae (no ontogenetic variation) and other prey (no seasonal variation). Diptera larvae and pupae were more important in August and April, but less important in October (Figure 2.6). Ephemeroptera nymphs were particularly important from July to September (in opposition to April and May), while other insect larvae (mostly corixidae and odonata)\n0\t20 40 60 80 100 120 140 0\t20 40 60 80 100 120 140 0\t20 40 60 80 100 120 140 0\t20 40 60 80 100 120 140\nTotal length (mm)\nFigure 2.6 \u2022 Ontogenetic and seasonal variation in the main food categories of pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus) diet.

Empty stomachs were frequent (unlike pumpkinseed and bass) but they were discarded for the analysis. The most important food category in mosquitofish diet was zooplankton (particularly Bosmina, Chydorus and copepods), both in volume and abundance (Figure 2.3). Diptera larvae were also important, although they were less frequently found in mosquitofish stomachs. Although foraging on zooplankton was frequent, mosquitofish displayed a broad resource use as a whole population. However, resource use in mosquitofish varied much between individuals (i.e. a high between-phenotype component of niche width), as demonstrated by high specific\nTable 2.1 \u2022 Summary table of ANCOVAs applied to main food categories in pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus) diet.\nFish length was used as covariate.\nFood category\tSource\tRelative abundance\t\tRelative volume\t\n\t\tF statistic\tP\tF statistic\tP\nZooplankton\tFish length Month\tno homogeneity of slopes\t\tno homogeneity of slopes\t\nDiptera larvae\tFish length\tF\\ 192 = 34.8\t0.000\tF1192 = 5.79\t0.017\n\tMonth\tF7,192 = 6.1\t0.000\tF7,192 = 2.57\t0.015\nDiptera pupae\tFish length\tF1 192 = 2.82\t0.095\tF1192 = 5.34\t0.022\n\tMonth\tF7,192 = 14.1\t0.000\tF7,192 = 10.3\t0.000\nEphemeroptera\tFish length\tF1 192 = 21.8\t0.000\tF1192 = 15.9\t0.000\n\tMonth\tF7,192 = l3.2\t0.000\tF7,192 = 10.0\t0.000\nInsecta larvae\tFish length\tF1192 = 3.62\t0.059\tF1192 = 3.28\t0.072\n\tMonth\tF7,192 = 4.26\t0.000\tF7,192 = 4.78\t0.000\nFish eggs\tFish length Month\tno homogeneity of slopes\t\tno homogeneity of slopes\t\nOther prey\tFish length\tF1,192 = 3.73\t0.055\tF1,192 = 6.87\t0.009\n\tMonth\tF7,192 = 0.70\t0.672\tF7,192 = 1.23\t0.286\nThe first DCA axis was significantly correlated to fish length (axis 1: r = -0.149, P = 0.038), unlike its second dimension (axis 2: r = -0.005, P = 0.942). The direction of maximum correlation between the axes and fish length is shown in the diagram, and it is almost coincident to the first DCA dimension (Figure 2.5). However, this weak (and marginally significant) ontogenetic gradient was shown to be overall unimportant in mosquitofish diet, as reflected in non-significant effects of fish length (covariate) on fish scores (ANCOVA on axis 1: F1,169 = 1.49, P = 0.224; on axis 2: F1,169 = 0.00, P = 0.988). We also found no significant diet variation that could be attributed to sex (axis 1: F2,169 =\n1.95, P = 0.145; axis 2: F2,169 = 1.45, P = 0.236), although a marginally significant interaction between sex and sampling month was recorded in the second DCA dimension (axis 1: F14,169 = 1.04, P = 0.415; axis 2: F14,169 = 13 8 5, P = 0.036). Not surprisingly, mean fish scores by sex (Figure 2.5) showed no association with any particular food category, being very close to the centroid of the plot. The largest contribution to the total variance in\nmosquitofish diet was due to sampling month (axis 1: F7,169 = 45.3, P = 0.000; axis 2: F7,169 = 34.3, P = 0.000). Consequently, mean fish scores by month showed a large scattering in the DCA biplot (Figure 2.5), displaying some association with particular prey types that occurred in noticeably high abundances in some months, such as Chydorus (July and May), diptera pupae (August), Bosmina (June and October) and Macrothrix (September).\nThese evidences on diet variation were corroborated by the analysis of main (pooled) food categories of mosquitofish (see Figure 2.7 and Table 2.2). Because differences in diet due to sex were found to be unimportant in the DCA, we excluded this factor from the analysis.\n40\t50\t60\n40\t50\t60\nTotal length (mm)\nFigure 2.7 \u2022 Ontogenetic and seasonal variation in the main food categories of mosquitofish (G. holbrooki) diet.

As a consequence, significant interactions between fish length and month were recorded for diptera larvae, pupae and other prey category (significant interaction under full ANCOVA model, P &lt;0.01).

Schoener overlap indices, calculated for inter-and intra-specific pairs of functional groups, varied between 0 and 0.93 (Table 2.3). There was inconsistency in overlap values, due to strong seasonal variation, but values were overall low (Table 2.3). High intra-specific overlap was observed in some cases among pumpkinseed and mosquitofish, the latter case being consistent in spring. In pumpkinseed, occasional high overlap values were more noticeable between the larger size classes, while smaller pumpkinseed seemed to explore different resources (except in August). Low values of a were found between mosquitofish and pumpkinseed functional groups (Table 2.3), except in some cases involving small pumpkinseed (LG1) and small-and medium-sized mosquitofish (GH1 and GH2). Diet overlap between pumpkinseed and\nYOY bass used similar resources (zooplankton) to mosquitofish.\nTable 2.3 \u2022 Diet overlap (Schoener\u2019s index, a) calculated for all combinations of species and functional groups (size classes) in each month.

This high degree of homogenisation has heightened the prevalence of small-sized\nomnivores and low abundance of piscivores, which represent structural features usually assigned to fish assemblages from warmer areas (Blanco et al., 2003). Lake Vela represents an extreme scenario and is therefore a potential candidate for restoration and progressive re-introductions of native fish, especially because of its small size (70 ha). However, information on its current ichthyocenosis status was lacking until now. This study has shown a marked dominance of the bass-pumpkinseed assemblage in Lake Vela, with very high abundances of the latter. Carp is more frequent in the deeper zones of the lake (Ferreira, 1997), while mosquitofish was restricted to the shallow protected margins. The use of littoral electrofishing coupled with seine nets was chosen because fish distribution in Lake Vela had shown to be extremely heterogeneous (Ferreira, 1997), and most catches were performed in structured habitats. However, the method clearly underestimated largemouth bass and carp populations, due to the larger size of their adults and evasiveness.\nIn comparison to the only study carried out so far in Lake Vela (Ferreira, 1997), a reduction in biodiversity was observed. This was associated with the introduction and proliferation of the invasive pumpkinseed (L. gibbosus} - presence not recorded in Ferreira\u2019s study - although there is not enough information to conclude if this was the cause for local extinction of the few resilient native species (such as Cobitis sp.). Alien fish species pose a major concern to the conservation status of Iberian freshwater fish assemblages, which are unique because of their high degree of endemicity (Elvira, 1995; Almaga, 1995b). Small lakes and warm monomictic reservoirs (particularly in the southern part of Portugal) are especially prone to proliferation of a dominant bass-pumpkinseed (Centrarchidae) assemblage (Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1994; Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Garcia-Berthou, 2002).\nLargemouth bass ecology\nThe absence of other piscivores in Iberian freshwaters favoured the introduction of largemouth bass (M. salmoides} as gamefish in the 1950s. In Portugal, well-established populations exist for a long time in the quiet waters of lakes and reservoirs, particularly in the centre and south of the country (Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1994; Almaga, 1995a). In Lake Vela, bass produced a more or less synchronised YOY cohort in early May, which continuously grew until September (at least). Garcia-Berthou\u2019s (2002) study also reported\nreproduction in May and rapid juvenile growth during the summer in Lake Banyoles (Spain). Lorenzoni et al. (2002) showed that reproduction in bass from Lake Trasimeno (Italy) was concentrated in a brief period from May (mostly) to June, when water temperatures were closer to 20\u00b0 C or above.\nIn spite of the low number of individuals sampled, our study showed that largemouth bass experienced an ontogenetic diet shift to progressively larger prey until becoming an exclusive piscivore, as shown for other Iberian populations (Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1994; Godinho et al., 1997; Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 2002). In Lake Vela, zooplanktivory was particularly important in smaller bass (&lt;40 mm), while insects (adults, nymphs and larvae) were only important in the summer (July-August), during the transition to piscivory. Other studies in Iberia have shown a much higher use of macroinvertebrates in bass diet, namely shrimp (Atyaephyra) and insect nymphs (Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1994; Godinho et al., 1997; Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 2002). This is probably related to the high zooplanktonic productivity of Lake Vela and low importance of macroinvertebrates other than diptera larvae (unpublished results from our team). Resource availability is likely to be the main factor behind the high heterogeneity in bass diet reported in Iberia (Rodr\u00edguez, 1989; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1994; Godinho et al., 1997; Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 2002), which strengthens the idea of Godinho et al. (1997) that bass forage on whichever prey is most frequent and abundant. The shift to exclusive piscivory (main prey mosquitofish) observed in Lake Vela can be considered precocious. This could be due to bias resulting from reduced sample size or a consequence of the extremely high availability of mosquitofish near the shore. Further data are needed for additional inference on piscivory in bass, including stomach content data from larger specimens (> 120 mm).\nPumpkinseed sunfish ecology\nPumkinseed introduction in Lake Vela is recent (less than 10 years), but the fish assemblage is now dominated by this centrarchid. One of the reasons for its success is the multi-spawner strategy and early maturity of Iberian populations (Vila-Gispert &amp; Moreno-Amich, 1998; 2000; Guti\u00e9rrez-Estrada et al., 2000). In Lake Vela, the pumkinseed population was mainly dominated by small-sized specimens, as a result from continuous recruitment from July to October. Progressive disappearance of larger size classes could be\nrelated to the migration of larger specimens to deeper waters (Garc\u00eda-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000).\nPumpkinseed is essentially an omnivorous feeder, adapted to benthic feeding, with a known preference on macroinvertebrates, although zooplankton is also an important prey, particularly in the smallest specimens (Godinho et al., 1997; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1998a; Garc\u00eda-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000). Our results confirmed this and also showed a strong seasonal variation in the use of macroinvertebrates, which were most relevant during the summer (depending on the specific taxon, see results). Diptera larvae, in particular, constituted a frequent and important prey item, which is a common feature of other European populations (Rodr\u00edguez, 1989; Godinho et al., 1997; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1998a; Wolfram-Wais et al., 1999). Still, most pumpkinseed explored numerous food resources, displaying a reasonable within-phenotype variation in diet, which has also been observed in other Iberian populations (Rodr\u00edguez, 1989; Godinho et al., 1997; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1998a). In its natural range of distribution (North America), the adults are viewed as moluscivores (feeding mostly on snails), but this feature seems to be much less important in Iberian populations (Godinho et al., 1997; Garc\u00eda-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich,\n2000), including Lake Vela. Instead, large fish foraged on fish eggs (chiefly in May) in considerable amounts (number and volume), as also reported by Garc\u00eda-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich (2000) and Copp et al. (2002). As these authors, we suspect egg consumption to be intra-specific (i.e. cannibalism). Unlike the population studied by Copp et al. (2002), piscivory in Lake Vela was residual, probably because other resources were available for pumpkinseed in Lake Vela.\nMosquitofish ecology\nFerreira (1997) had already shown that mosquitofish concentrated in very high densities near the shoreline in Lake Vela, amidst vegetation. This is a useful defence mechanism from bass predation (see above), as bass forages less efficiently in structured habitats (see e.g. Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1994). Due to its small size and susceptibility to predation, mosquitofish is usually restricted to vegetated zones and/or shallow habitats, such as marshes, rice paddies or irrigation channels (Fern\u00e1ndez-Delgado, 1989; Cabral &amp; Marques, 1999; Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 1999). In Lake Vela, an extremely abundant population dominated by females (except in May) displayed substantial sexual activity throughout\nspring and summer. As shown by other authors (Fern\u00e1ndez-Delgado, 1989; Fern\u00e1ndez-Delgado &amp; Rossomanno, 1997), mosquitofish produced two generations during the reproductive period. Most of the parental generation disappeared after the spring reproduction period (Fern\u00e1ndez-Delgado, 1989; Fern\u00e1ndez-Delgado &amp; Rossomanno, 1997; Cabral &amp; Marques, 1999) and some of their progeny (early spring cohort) gave birth to a late summer generation.\nThis small-sized Poeciliidae is native to eastern USA and Mexico and it primarily feeds on zooplankton (chiefly cladocerans) and insect larvae and adults (Rodr\u00edguez, 1989; Cabral et al., 1998; Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 1999; Blanco et al., 2004). Unlike Cabral et al. (1998), we found no significant diet variation due to sex. Mosquitofish diet varied seasonally and only a weak ontogenetic diet shift was observed, corroborating Garc\u00eda-Berthou's (1999) observations. Although littoral zooplankton was the main food category (both in abundance and volume), a large variety of other prey (omnivory) was consumed (as shown by Rodr\u00edguez, 1989; Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 1999), including benthic larvae (mostly dipterans), terrestrial insects and aquatic neuston (chiefly diptera pupae and imagos). Substantial variation among individual fish was recorded, resulting in a high between-phenotype component of niche width. The large seasonal component in diet variation suggests a high degree of opportunist feeding, with mosquitofish foraging on the most available resource in each month.\nResource exploitation in alien taxa\nLargemouth bass, pumpkinseed and mosquitofish displayed substantial variation in their diet, suggesting both ontogenetic shifts and opportunistic feeding. The latter could not be totally confirmed because of the lack of a contemporaneous resource matrix, but the high seasonal variation of mosquitofish and pumpkinseed diet strongly suggests so. Water column niche was very important (planktivory) and diversified in all taxa, while the benthic niche was chiefly represented by diptera larvae (most other macroinvertebrates were found on an occasional basis). The opposite (low importance of planktivory) has been reported in lotic habitats (Godinho et al., 1997; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1998a). The low diversity of the benthic environment is the likely result of low macrophyte coverage in Lake Vela, which is a consequence of very high turbidity. In spite of high degree of planktivory and poor benthic resources, most combinations between functional groups\nrevealed low diet overlap. Despite opportunistic feeding, there was no consistent evidence for resource competition among these taxa, although some combinations between YOY pumpkinseed and mosquitofish showed high overlap indices. The less noticeable ontogenetic diet shift in mosquitofish enhanced resource overlap between intra-specific functional groups during the spring reproduction period (when two cohorts coexisted).\nThe overall low diet overlap between the most abundant fish species in Lake Vela is one of the factors contributing to the success and coexistence of these alien taxa. Other factors include omnivory and ontogenetic diet shifts (observed in pumpkinseed and bass), which allow a broader resource use, reducing inter- and intra-specific competition, thus enhancing growth rates and fecundity. As a result, as seen above, the production of numerous offspring during the reproductive period allows the maintenance of large populations, which exert strong top-down effects on lower trophic levels. The current study could not evaluate the impact of piscivory by bass on mosquitofish and pumpkinseed populations.\nReferences\nAbrams P. (1980). Some comments on measuring niche overlap.

In this study, zooplanktivory in the omnivorous fish assemblage of Lake Vela was examined from April to October 2003 (and also in January 2004). During this period, the ichthyocenosis was characterised by high abundances of juvenile fish, which strongly depended on zooplankton. Adult mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) foraged on the same zooplanktonic prey than juveniles, although planktivory was less important in larger fish. Using canonical correspondence analysis, it was possible to attribute most of the variability in planktivory to resource availability, as both fish foraged on the most abundant prey in each month. Albeit this opportunistic behaviour, mosquitofish was found to be positively selective towards small-sized littoral cladocerans, while pumpkinseed displayed positive selection towards Alona and Daphnia. In the absence of more efficient planktivores, pumpkinseed is now the main planktivore in Lake Vela and the main predator of Daphnia. However, due to low densities of Daphnia during most of the study period, Daphnia was virtually absent from the diet of pumpkinseed from June to October, a period during which this benthi-planktivore foraged chiefly on less-rewarding prey (small-sized cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods). Predation upon Daphnia in spring may contribute to daphniid collapse in May, but their absence during summer and autumn cannot be explained without additional influence of undetermined factors.\nKEYWORDS\nFood-web interactions, planktivory, alien fish, Mediterranean shallow lake, resource availability\nIntroduction\nMost literature available on freshwater trophic cascades in Europe concerns northern temperate lakes, where the structuring role of the pelagic fish assemblage on lower trophic levels has been studied in detail (see e.g. Christofferson et al., 1993; Jacobsen et al., 1997; Romare et al., 1999; Eklov &amp; VanKooten, 2001; Romare &amp; Hansson, 2003). At these latitudes, pike (Esox lucius} and/or perch (Perca spp.) usually represent the main piscivores, while roach (Rutilus rutilus) and juvenile perch make up the planktivore assemblage (Luecke et al., 1990; Jacobsen et al., 1997; Romare et al., 1999; Eklov &amp; VanKooten, 2001; Irz et al., 2002; Romare &amp; Hansson, 2003). However, little\ninformation is available on trophic interactions in Mediterranean lakes, and especially in Iberia, where fish communities of inland waters exhibit strong dominance of omnivorous cyprinids (such as Barbus spp., Chondrostoma spp. and Squalius spp.) and absence or low abundance of piscivores (Almaga, 1995; Blanco et al., 2003). Moreover, in most Iberian habitats where water current is low and aquatic vegetation is present, small-sized omnivorous invaders (chiefly mosquitofish and pumpkinseed) have become the predominant fish species, displacing indigenous fauna and reducing biodiversity. The impact of such a fish assemblage on the lower trophic levels of Mediterranean lakes has been overlooked, particularly in shallow polymictic lakes, where eutrophication is a serious threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function.\nPlanktivores are known to be size-selective, preferring larger, more rewarding prey (Hall et al., 1976; Gliwicz, 1994), but they must also adapt to dynamic fluctuations in the density thresholds of their prey (Gliwicz, 2001; 2002; Gliwicz et al., 2004; Scheuerell et al., 2005). Flexible foraging behaviour (Roseman et al., 1996; Scheuerell et al., 2005) allows predators to explore diverse food resources without compromising growth rates. The importance of planktivory in freshwater ecosystems is well illustrated by the structuring role of planktivores in trophic cascading phenomena (e.g. Christofferson et al., 1993; Williams &amp; Moss, 2003; T\u00e1trai et al., 2003a; 2003b; Blanco et al., 2004), especially YOY fish (Post et al., 1997; Romare et al., 1999). In Lake Vela (Portugal), cascading effects were evident in 2001 when an abnormal Daphnia-dominance phase was recorded during the whole summer, after a large fish kill at the end of May, leading to effective control of summer phytoplankton (Antunes et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2006). Lake Vela displays a poorly diversified fish community, dominated by alien taxa, which exert strong predatory pressure on zooplankton. Non-natives pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus (L.)) and mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki Girard), in particular, are present in very high abundances. Diet analysis of these taxa revealed a generalist (omnivorous) diet (Castro et al., submitted manuscript1), making both species little dependent of a few food categories. This allows them to attain high growth rates and reduced mortality, as a result of a phenotypically plastic exploitation of resources (detritus, benthic fauna and zooplankton). Although more important in the diet of smaller specimens, zooplanktivory was substantial in all life stages of pumpkinseed and mosquitofish. The use of zooplankton was also\n1 Cap\u00edtulo 2 da tese\nimportant in the diet of juvenile (YOY) largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede)).\nHere, we present a detailed analysis on the use of zooplankton in the diet of the main planktivorous fish from Lake Vela. The main goals of the study were: 1) to identify the main sources of variation (ontogeny vs. resource availability) in the diet of YOY bass, pumpkinseed and mosquitofish; 2) to assess the relative importance of the main zooplanktonic taxa in the diet and to detect patterns of prey selection (electivity); 3) to improve our understanding of fish-zooplankton interactions in shallow eutrophic lakes facing fish fauna homogenisation.\nMaterials and methods\nFish sampling and gut content analysis\nFish were collected monthly from April to October 2003 as a pooled sample from (at least) two different sampling points in Lake Vela. In order to make our data set more comprehensive, we also captured fish later in January (winter). A combination of seine nets and electrofishing (using portable gear and dip nets) was used, covering both openwater and vegetated areas, with an approximate constant sampling effort. The joint use of such methods underestimates large evasive fish but it is particularly useful in collecting smaller specimens (including new recruits), especially in structured environments (near the shore and in macrophyte beds). All captured fish were sorted by taxon and immediately stored on ice, and later frozen.\nIn the laboratory, all individuals were counted after thawing, and length measurements (TL) were performed with a precision of 0.5 mm. An initial subsample of 50 specimens (or all, if n &lt;50), comprehending all possible size classes for each combination of month and species, was selected for gut content inspection. These specimens were eviscerated and non-empty stomachs were preserved in 70% ethanol, until further processing was possible. Since mosquitofish lack a distinctive and individualised stomach, the anterior third of the gut was excised (Cabral et al., 1998). Enumeration of gut contents was only carried out on non-empty stomachs in which most food categories could be clearly identified (proportion of digested material &lt;50% total stomach content volume) to minimise bias due to differential digestion of prey items (Hyslop, 1980; Amundsen et al., 1996). All bass stomachs were analysed, while a total of 25 stomachs per month were\nZooplankton sampling\nZooplankton was sampled fortnightly from April 2003 to January 2004 as a pooled composite sample from two different sampling points in Lake Vela: a vegetation-free site and near a macrophyte (Nymphaea alba) patch. Composite water samples were collected at each site with a vertical Van Dorn bottle (sample volume: 16-25.6 L) and concentrated with a 55-mm-mesh plankton net. Each sample was immediately preserved in sucrose-saturated 4% formalin, stained with Bengal rose, and stored until further examination. In the laboratory, cladocerans were identified to the genus/species level and copepods were separated into nauplii and copepodites + adults (cyclopoid or calanoid). Counting by subsampling was used for the most abundant taxa, but the whole sample was usually screened in order to enumerate large organisms (particularly Daphnia). Zooplankton abundance data were expressed as densities (ind L-1).\nData analysis\nCorrelation was used to assess the relationship between zooplankton ingestion and fish size (Pearson's r was used for abundance data, while Spearman's rs was utilised for percent volume). Log transformation of data was used when this improved linearity.\nCanonical correspondence analysis (CCA; ter Braak, 1986) was used to describe the main sources of diet variation in each fish species. This family of multivariate techniques has already been used in the analysis of dietary data (Godinho et al., 1997; Godinho &amp; Ferreira, 1998; Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 1999; Garda-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Garda-Berthou, 2001; 2002). The purpose of CCA is two-fold: it reduces a species x sample matrix to a few dimensions (the eigenvectors) that explain the highest proportion of total variation in the data while, at the same time, it extracts \u201cenvironmental\u201d gradients that enable the researcher to ascertain and quantify relationships between species data and explanatory variables (ter Braak, 1986; 1995). In our study, CCA was applied to prey (zooplankton) abundance data, log transformed, using each fish (stomach) as a sampling\nunit. Rare prey items were down-weighted to minimise their influence in the analysis (ter Braak, 1995). Two environmental matrices were taken into account as potential sources of variation in planktivory: 1) a resource matrix, comprising the densities of the zooplanktonic taxa recorded in the lake; 2) a (log) fish size matrix. The statistical significance of the model was tested using a Monte-Carlo (unrestricted) permutation test. A CCA-derived variation partitioning technique (Borcard et al., 1992; 0kland &amp; Eilersten,\n1994)\twas used to quantify the variation explained by resource availability and fish size. This was performed by partialling out (as covariables - see ter Braak, 1988) each of the subsets of explanatory variables at a time and comparing the percentage of variance explained by the partial CCAs with the one obtained with the global CCA model (resource\navailability + fish size).\nThe preferences of fish for different zooplankton species were estimated for each predator and prey item using Vanderploeg &amp; Scavia's relativised electivity index (E*),\nfollowing Lechowicz (1982):\nE*\nWi - (1 n)\trjp\n=\t, with Wi =\t,\t,\nW + (1/n)\tE ri/Pi\nwhere ri is the percent share (proportional abundance) of prey i in the diet, pi is the percent share of prey i in the environment, and n is the number of prey types included in the analysis. The index ranges from -1 (negative selection) to 1 (positive selection), with values close to zero indicating neutral selectivity (see also Lechowicz, 1982; Gliwicz et al., 2004; Alcaraz &amp; Garcia-Berthou, 2006). Spearman correlation coefficient (rs) was used to assess the relationship between electivity and fish size (TL). To test whether electivity significantly deviated from 0 (i.e. neutral selection), a one-sample sign test was applied to the most important prey taxa. The use of this simple non-parametric method was justified by the non-normal and/or highly skewed distribution of the data. A significance level (a) of 0.05 was used.\nResults\nThe fish community of Lake Vela was dominated in numbers by pumpkinseed sunfish (L. gibbosus), mosquitofish (G. holbrooki) and largemouth bass (M. salmoides). These three alien fish species displayed a high degree of planktivory, depending on their ontogeny.

Triangles and stars represent zooplanktonic prey scores and mean fish scores by month, respectively. Arrows represent gradients extracted by the multivariate procedure.\nFigure 3.4A shows that, overall, pumpkinseed fed on the most abundant microinvertebrates available, since all species scores were located on the positive side of its respective resource gradient (arrows in biplot). This was, however, more pronounced in some taxa (e.g. Daphnia, Alona) than others (e.g. Cyclopoida, Macrothrix) The CCA analysis also identified a seasonal component in planktivory, with fish feeding on Alona (chiefly) and Chydorus in May, while Daphnia provided substantial contributions to the diet in April and January (Figure 3.4A and Table 3.2). During summer and fall, planktivory was variable but no prey item was found to be predominant overall. Mean fish scores by season clearly illustrate the seasonal variation in planktivory (Figure 3.4A). Although fish size contributed modestly to the total diet variation, a moderate ontogenetic shift in planktivory can be observed in Figure 3.4B. Prey preferred by larger fish are situated on the left side of the diagram (e.g. Daphnia), while species on the right side of the diagram (e.g. Macrothrix, Alona, Bosmina) were consumed chiefly by smaller specimens.\nPlanktivory in mosquitofish\nLike pumpkinseed, mosquitofish foraged substantially less on zooplankton in August (Table 3.3), but in the remaining months planktivory was very frequent (%O > 67%), although less in the largest specimens (TL > 40 mm). Albeit substantial seasonal fluctuations, zooplankton was almost always the single most important food category (%A > 50%). There was also substantial seasonal variation in the proportion of each zooplanktonic species consumed (Table 3.3). These fluctuations suggest a dependence on resource availability (Figure 3.3), which was confirmed by the CCA analysis (see next paragraph). For all size classes of mosquitofish, planktivory was almost exclusively focused on small-sized cladocerans (mainly Bosmina longisrostris, Chydorus spp. and Macrothrix sp.) and cyclopoid copepods. Daphnia was virtually absent from mosquitofish diet.\nZooplankton density in Lake Vela and fish size together explained 39.8% of the total variation (total inertia 3.573) of planktivory in mosquitofish (CCA: Monte-Carlo test, P &lt;0.05). The contribution of zooplankton density (resource availability) was significantly (partial CCA: Monte-Carlo test, P &lt;0.05) related to variation in the planktivory data, explaining 38.7% of the total variation (sum of all canonical eigenvalues = 1.383). The remaining 1.1% was attributable to fish size (0.4%) and to the intersection (0.7%) of both\nTable 3.3 \u2022 Planktivory in mosquitofish in Lake Vela from April to January.

This was particularly pronounced in Macrothrix, which was the preferred food item in August and September (Table 3.3 and Figure 3.5). The CCA analysis thus identified a seasonal component in planktivory, most evident in August and September and also in June and October. The latter case was mostly due to the relative contribution of Bosmina to the diet in these months (Table 3.3 and Figure 3.5). As shown by plotting mean fish scores by season (Figure 3.5), no distinct\nFigure 3.5 \u2022 Partial CCA ordination biplot of gut contents (log prey abundance) from mosquitofish. Diagram displays variation in planktivory due to resource availability (lake zooplankton density). Triangles and stars represent zooplanktonic prey scores and mean fish scores by month, respectively. Arrows represent gradients of resource availability.\nPrey selection (electivity)\nElectivity was only computed for mosquitofish and pumpkinseed, where it was found to be overall independent of fish size (Figures 3.6 and 3.7). However, negative significant correlations where found when prey categories where absent from the diet (E* = -1) in larger specimens, as in the case of Bosmina and Chydorus in pumpkinseed (Figure 3.6), and Macrothrix in mosquitofish (Figure 3.7). A positive significant correlation was observed between the electivity in Alona and mosquitofish size (Figure 3.7). The absence of prey categories in the diet had a large influence in their mean electivity index, resulting in negative selection for all zooplankton taxa (Figure 3.8). However, a substantially different pattern was produced when all individual fish data points of value -1 (prey category absent in diet) were discarded (Figure 3.8). We believe this latter scenario to be\necologically sounder, since the absence of a particular prey item could reflect the influence of other sources of variation (resource patchiness or ontogenetic diet shifts, as shown above), rather than actual prey selectivity. Thus, neutral selection (sign test, P > 0.05; H0: E* = 0) was found for most prey categories, when guts where prey categories were absent were not accounted for. However, pumpkinseed was found to be positively selective (sign test, P &lt;0.05) for Alona and Daphnia, while mosquitofish displayed significant positive selection for Alona, Chydorus and Macrothrix.\nr = -0.315\nr = -0.394\n0\t20\t40\t60\t80 100 120 140\t0\t20\t40\t60\t80 100 120 140\t0\t20\t40\t60\t80 100 120 140\n\u00b0 O \u00a9\n\tCOQ^j O O Qoo \u00b0\tg o | o\u00b0\tOq$D\u00b0 o\nQ Q) O &amp;\to\t\to\nO \u00b0 n.a.\u2014I-.-\to 0 OD\t0\to\nFish size (mm)\nFigure 3.6 \u2022 Relationship between fish size (TL) and food selectivity (electivity, E,) in individual pumpkinseed (n = 201 for each major prey category).

Largemouth bass was also planktivorous during the early stages of its life, maximising resource use by shifting from a benthi-planktivorous phase (May-June) to piscivory (from July onwards).\nThe CCA showed that a large portion of variation in the use of zooplankton in pumpkinseed and mosquitofish diet could be explained by the resource matrix alone (zooplankton abundance in the environment). Still, a large fraction of variation remained unexplained, which could be attributable to random variation among individuals and unknown factors. The fraction of variation explained by resource availability was larger for pumpkinseed than for mosquitofish. In both diets (mosquitofish and pumpkinseed), the strong dependence on resource availability confirmed these taxa as opportunistic feeders, foraging on the most frequent and abundant prey. The CCA diagrams confirmed that the\nseasonal variation in planktivory was mostly a reflex of the availability of prey in the environment. Although the use of zooplankton (as a whole) in the diet was found to decrease with fish length, the use of zooplanktonic taxa was shown to be little dependent on fish size. No substantial ontogenetic shifts were found in either mosquitofish or pumpkinseed, although the latter displayed some degree of heterogeneity in the use of some taxa (e.g. Daphnia) between larger and smaller specimens.\nPlanktivory in pumpkinseed was higher than what had been previously recorded outside of its natural range of occurrence (Godinho et al., 1997; Wolfram-Wais et al., 1999; Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000). Pumpkinseed is usually viewed as being adapted to benthic feeding, foraging on macroinvertebrates (Robinson et al., 1993). Although frequent, zooplanktivory usually is not very significant, except in the smallest specimens (Godinho et al., 1997; Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000). However, Robinson et al. (1993) showed that the degree of zooplanktivory increases in the absence of more efficient zooplanktivores, such as bluegill sunfish or roach (see also discussion by Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000). When abundant, large cladocerans (such as Daphnia) seem to be the preferred zooplankton prey of pumpkinseed (Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000). In Lake Vela, substantial consumption of D. longispina was observed only in April and January, when daphniids were abundant (> 100 ind L-1). Moreover, pumpkinseed exhibited positive selection for Daphnia, confirming it as a preferential prey (along with Alona spp.). Due to overall low densities of Daphnia in Lake Vela, however, planktivory in pumpkinseed consisted mainly of smaller cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods during summer and fall.\nIn spite of its name and reputation, most literature on mosquitofish diet in Mediterranean countries (Cabral et al., 1998; Garcia-Berthou, 1999; Margaritora et al., 2001; Blanco et al., 2004) has portrayed this species as being planktivorous, foraging chiefly on littoral microinvertebrates, such as cladocerans and copepods. This was also observed in the present study, where mosquitofish exhibited positive selection for littoral cladocerans, namely Alona, Chydorus and Macrothrix. Most planktivorous fish usually display a strong preference for larger prey (i.e. daphniids), but we found very few mosquitofish foraging on Daphnia or Simocephalus (littoral taxon). Garcia-Berthou (1999) also found overall reduced importance of Daphnia in mosquitofish diet. There are two possible alternative or complementary explanations for this: a) Daphnia is less abundant in\nthe littoral micro-habitat occupied by mosquitofish; b) most mosquitofish size classes are gape-limited relatively to large cladocerans. The coexistence of mosquitofish in mesocosms with large Daphnia carinata (Matveev et al., 2000) seems to support the latter hypothesis.\nBased on what has been discussed so far, it is clear that the impact of mosquitofish and pumpkinseed on the lower trophic levels of Lake Vela is different. Furthermore, mosquitofish is restricted to the margins of the lake or to structured environments, such as macrophyte patches. Several studies (Hurlbert et al., 1972; Margaritora et al., 2001; Nagdali &amp; Gupta, 2002) have shown that the impact of mosquitofish can be very large, with its presence or absence producing distinct lake states (trophic cascade). However, these studies were conducted in ponds or artificial mesocosms, where mosquitofish was the only fish species present. In Lake Vela, as in many other shallow lakes, the small-sized mosquitofish competes with and is preyed upon other fish species, which confine its occurrence to shallow channels, lake margins or sites with dense macrophyte coverage (Fern\u00e1ndez-Delgado, 1989; Cabral &amp; Marques, 1999; Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 1999). Although marginal overall, the impact of mosquitofish on lake zooplankton is not unimportant, since its littoral foraging habits may nullify the refuge effect of macrophytes as a predatoravoidance strategy of zooplankton (Burks et al., 2002; Castro et al., 2007).\nWe also carried out sporadic gut inspections in carp (not shown here) and we observed, albeit the low number of captures, a predominance of detritus and seeds in the diet and residual planktivory. Planktivory in carp is uncommon in lakes, since they are not efficient planktivores (see discussion in Garc\u00eda-Berthou, 2001). Since planktivory in mosquitofish and largemouth bass is restricted in space (lake margins) and time (May-June), respectively, pumpkinseed can therefore be considered the main planktivore in Lake Vela. Furthermore, pumpkinseed was the only fish species to forage extensively on D. longispina (mostly in April), a key taxon in controlling phytoplankton growth and water transparency in Lake Vela (Castro &amp; Gon\u00e7alves, submitted manuscript2; Antunes et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2006). Our results have shown that predation on Daphnia was not restricted to YOY fish and that larger pumpkinseeds seemed more interested in Daphnia than smaller size classes. When Daphnia was less abundant, however, pumpkinseed shifted to smaller cladocerans and copepods, as shown for other planktivores (Roseman et al.,\n2 Cap\u00edtulo 1 da tese\n1996; Gliwicz, 2001; 2002; Gliwicz et al., 2004; Scheuerell et al., 2005). This is not surprising, given the extremely high abundances of small-sized cladocerans and cyclopoid copepods in Lake Vela (see Figure 3.3), which reduce the fish perception of larger prey below a certain density threshold (see theoretical insight in Gliwicz, 2001; Gliwicz et al., 2004). Pumpkinseed seems to be able to dynamically shift food resource use (benthos, large and small zooplankton) without compromising its growth rates or reproductive success in Lake Vela (Castro et al., submitted manuscript), thus confirming flexible foraging behaviour (vide Roseman et al., 1996; Gliwicz, 2002; Scheuerell et al., 2005). Not all species remain unaffected by the collapse of Daphnia in the lake (e.g. Prout et al., 1990; Roseman et al., 1996).\nDaphnia grazing represents a fundamental mechanism in shallow lakes (Scheffer, 1998) and we (Castro &amp; Gon\u00e7alves, submitted manuscript) have shown that its population dynamics mediates two distinct water states in Lake Vela. Thus, Daphnia population usually collapses in late spring and eventually disappears in midsummer (July-August). The timing (April-May) of planktivory upon Daphnia by pumpkinseed and YOY largemouth bass suggests they may have contributed to the population collapse (see Figure 3.3). This joint effect of adult and YOY fish has also been pointed out as the most likely reason for the decline of copepods in Lake Krankesjon (Hansson et al., 2007). After the collapse of D. longispina in May, low densities were observed and no recovery in Daphnia was observed throughout the summer, as typically observed in other temperate lakes and attributable to fish-induced mortality (e.g. Luecke et al., 1990; Boersma et al., 1996). However, virtually no Daphnia were found from June to October in fish stomachs from Lake Vela (but they were still observed in the lake in June and July). This result suggests that other factors besides predation also contribute to the suppression of Daphnia during the summer and autumn. Clearly, additional research is required to understand the interactions between zooplankton and the alien omnivorous assemblage, particularly pumpkinseed sunfish.\nReferences\nAbrantes N., Antunes S.C., Pereira M.J. &amp; Gon\u00e7alves F.

Para tal, foram levados a cabo programas di\u00e1rios de amostragem durante tr\u00eas dias consecutivos, ao longo de um transepto horizontal que incluiu esta\u00e7\u00f5es na zona pel\u00e1gica e na zona litoral (presen\u00e7a da macr\u00f3fita Nymphaea alba). Dado que a transpar\u00eancia desempenha um papel crucial no risco colocado pelos predadores visuais, as campanhas de amostragem foram conduzidas em duas fases distintas (\u00e1gua turva e \u00e1gua transparente). Na fase de \u00e1gua turva, a maioria dos taxa zooplanct\u00f3nicos exibiram uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o homog\u00e9nea ao longo dos eixos verticais e horizontais, durante os tr\u00eas dias consecutivos. A \u00fanica excep\u00e7\u00e3o foi observada nos n\u00e1uplios de cop\u00e9podes, que revelaram um padr\u00e3o vertical heterog\u00e9neo, possivelmente como resposta a predadores invertebrados. Na fase de maior transpar\u00eancia, a maioria dos zooplanctontes exibiu selec\u00e7\u00e3o de habitat. Verticalmente, a resposta geral consistiu num padr\u00e3o de migra\u00e7\u00e3o vertical, apesar da reduzida profundidade (1.6 m), enquanto que horizontalmente foram observadas densidades zooplanct\u00f3nicas mais elevadas na zona pel\u00e1gica, independentemente da altura do dia. Este resultado contradiz o papel das macr\u00f3fitas enquanto ref\u00fagio para os zooplanctontes. Os padr\u00f5es horizontais e verticais observados nesta fase foram particularmente consp\u00edcuos para os esp\u00e9cimes de maiores dimens\u00f5es, sugerindo que o risco de preda\u00e7\u00e3o colocado pelos peixes foi o principal factor por detr\u00e1s da heterogeneidade espacial na Primavera. Deste modo, as diferen\u00e7as observadas entre as duas campanhas de amostragem parecem ser mediadas pelo risco de preda\u00e7\u00e3o, que est\u00e1 directamente relacionado com o grau de transpar\u00eancia da \u00e1gua. Em suma, o zoopl\u00e2ncton da Lagoa da Vela exibiu uma distribui\u00e7\u00e3o vertical heterog\u00e9nea para minimizar a elevada press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria exercida pela ictiocenose ex\u00f3tica.

Here we studied diel variation in the vertical and horizontal distribution of the crustacean plankton in Lake Vela, a shallow polymictic and eutrophic lake. Diel sampling was carried out on three consecutive days along a horizontal transept, including an open-water station and a macrophyte (Nymphaea alba) bed. Since transparency is a key determinant of the predation risk posed by fish, the zooplankton sampling campaigns were conducted in both the turbid (autumn) and clear water (spring) phases. In the turbid phase, most taxa were homogeneously distributed along the vertical and horizontal axes in the three consecutive days. The only exception was for copepod nauplii, which showed vertical heterogeneity, possibly as a response to invertebrate predators. In the clear water phase, most zooplankton taxa displayed habitat selection. Vertically, the general response consisted of a daily vertical migration (DVM), despite the limited depth (1.6 m). Horizontally, zooplankters showed an overall preference for the pelagic zone, independent of the time of the day. Such evidence is contrary to the postulated role of macrophytes as an anti-predator refuge for the zooplankton. These vertical (DVM) and horizontal (macrophyte-avoidance) patterns were particularly conspicuous for large Daphnia, suggesting that predation risk from size-selective predators (fish) was the main factor behind the spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton in the spring. Thus, the difference in the zooplankton spatial distribution pattern and habitat selection among seasons (turbid and clear water phases) seems to be mediated the predation risk from fish, which is directly related to water transparency. The zooplankton in Lake Vela displays antipredator behaviour that minimises predation from fish. We hypothesise that, due to the distinct fish community of shallow Mediterranean lakes, aquatic macrophytes may not provide adequate refuge to zooplankters, as seen in northern temperate lakes.\nKEYWORDS\nFreshwater zooplankton, spatial distribution, patchiness, migration, alternative states\nIntroduction\nThe distribution of aquatic organisms, and particularly plankton, has long been known to be heterogeneous. Spatial heterogeneity is a common feature in all ecosystems and is the result of many interacting physical and biological processes (Pinel-Alloul, 1995; Folt &amp; Burns, 1999; Hulsmann et al., 1999; Thackeray et al., 2004). Physical processes,\nsuch as wind-induced turbulence or currents (Thackeray et al., 2004), seem to be the main drivers of large-scale heterogeneity. As the spatial scale decreases, the importance of biological processes increases and may overlap that of the physical processes (Folt &amp; Burns, 1999). The formation of swarms or aggregations in plankton is considered to be a consequence of the search for food (Jensen et al., 2001; Roozen &amp; Lurling, 2001) and mates (Folt &amp; Burns, 1999), and to predator-avoidance (Kvam &amp; Kleiven, 1995; Roozen &amp; Lurling, 2001). Predatory pressure, in particular, has received considerable attention as a major driving force of zooplankton patchiness. Examples of predator-induced aggregations, resulting in spatial patterns of freshwater zooplankton, include avoidance of the shore (Romare &amp; Hansson, 2003; Pinel-Alloul et al., 2004), diel vertical migration (Gilbert &amp; Hampton, 2001; Han &amp; Straskraba, 2001; Hembre &amp; Megard, 2003; Ringelberg &amp; Van Gool, 2003) and diel horizontal migration (Kvam &amp; Kleiven, 1995; Lauridsen &amp; Buenk, 1996; Burks et al., 2002; Wojtal et al., 2003).\nDiel vertical migration (DVM) is one of the best-studied antipredator defences of zooplankton. The most usual pattern of DVM is for a population of zooplankton to dwell in deeper waters during the day and then to rise towards the warm surface waters for a few hours at night, thus avoiding visually-oriented predators during the day (Dodson, 1990; Han &amp; Straskraba, 2001). This behavioural pattern is triggered by light changes at dusk and dawn (Ringelberg, 1999; Ringelberg &amp; Van Gool, 2003), and is related to light penetration of the water column (Dodson, 1990; Alonso et al., 2004). The phototactic reactions leading to DVM are strongly enhanced by predator signals, particularly fish kairomones (Loose &amp; Dawidowicz, 1994; Ringelberg, 1999; Ringelberg &amp; Van Gool,\n2003). In shallow lakes, however, there may be no hypolimnetic refuge available (Burks et al., 2002). Han and Straskraba (2001) suggested that aggregation near the sediment during the day may be used as a defence strategy in shallow lakes, as confirmed in the field by Jeppesen et al. (2002). Numerous studies have also shown that large zooplankters often aggregate in vegetation stands, swimming out only at night to the adjacent open water (Kvam &amp; Kleiven, 1995; Lauridsen &amp; Buenk, 1996; Masson et al., 2001; Wojtal et al., 2003). This phenomenon - diel horizontal migration (DHM; Burks et al., 2002) - depends on the effectiveness of macrophytes as a refuge, which seems to result from the balance between predator pressure and macrophyte density (Schriver et al., 1995; Jeppesen et al., 1998; Perrow et al., 1999; Burks et al., 2002). In addition, macrophyte stands also\nrepresent a potential hazard for the zooplankton, which can suffer severe predation losses to macrophyte-associated biota (Perrow et al., 1999; Hulsmann et al., 1999; Masson et al.,\n2001). This is particularly important in the case where planktivorous fish (especially juveniles) also use macrophytes as a refuge from piscivores (Burks et al., 2002; Romare et al., 2003; Romare &amp; Hansson, 2003).\nPredation gradients are usually coupled with marked physical gradients, both vertically (epilimnion/hypolimnion) and horizontally (near-shore/offshore). In shallow polymictic lakes, however, such gradients are less well defined, due to the poorly marked separation between littoral and pelagic zones and to the constant mixing of the water column. Furthermore, in shallow Mediterranean lakes, the fish community is dominated by omnivorous fish (Blanco et al., 2003) that prey heavily on zooplankton, including in littoral areas (Garcia-Berthou, 1999; Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000), thus precluding the littoral refuge effect of aquatic vegetation. Therefore, the spatial heterogeneity of zooplankton in such lakes may not comply with what has been observed in northern temperate lakes, where most of the studies on DVM and DHM have been conducted.\nGiven the distinctive characteristics of shallow Mediterranean lakes, we conducted a study on the spatial distribution patterns of the zooplankton from Lake Vela (Portugal) under contrasting conditions (turbid vs. clear water phase). The main aim was to assess if zooplankters exhibited antipredator behaviour, such as habitat selection and/or diel migration pattern, as a response to predation pressure from fish. More specifically, we intended: i) to determine whether DVM is constrained in this shallow and polymictic lake;\nii)\tto assess if macrophytes provide refuge for zooplankters against littoral-foraging predators. To do so, we performed 3-day diel sampling cycles at littoral (macrophyte bed) and pelagic sampling sites at two depths (near the surface and near the bottom). The study was conducted during the turbid and the clear water phases, since these two alternative states represent contrasting conditions in terms of water transparency and fish predation pressure.\nMaterials and methods\nSite description\nLake Vela is a small (maximum floodable area 70 ha), shallow (0.9 m average depth; 2.4 m maximum depth) and polymictic water body in the centre of Portugal. It is\nthreatened by eutrophication and exotic species introductions, as a consequence of human activities. It is the largest lake of a system of small lakes located within a maritime pine forest. Although emergent macrophytes (especially Cladium mariscus (L.) and Nymphaea alba L.) occur in some patches near the shoreline, 80-90% of the flooded lakebed has no macrophytes. This is probably due to high turbidity, which has been increasing for the past two decades. A few patches of submerged macrophytes develop during the clear water phase in spring and some persist during the summer. Large fluctuations in phytoplankton have been observed and frequent Cyanobacteria blooms have also been recorded (Antunes et al., 2003). Daphnia cf. longispina (O.F. Muller) (D. galeata x hyalina complex), Bosmina longirostris (O.F. Muller), Ceriodaphnia pulchella G.O. Sars, chydorids and cyclopoid copepods are the dominant crustacean taxa in Lake Vela and the most significant grazers (particularly Daphnia) Due to very high densities of planktivorous fish, predator pressure on zooplankton is substantial. The fish community has changed radically, due to repeated introductions of alien species, which have displaced native cyprinids (Barbus spp., Chondrostoma spp. and Squalius spp.). At the present, the dominant fish species are all non-indigenous: omnivores/planktivores - pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus (L.)) and mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki Girard); benthivores - carp (Cyprinus carpio L.); piscivore - largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides (Lacepede)). Eel (Anguilla anguilla (L.)) is the only native species still present in large numbers. Both mosquitofish and pumpkinseed exert a strong, though seasonally variable, predatory pressure on zooplankton (Cabral et al., 1998; Garcia-Berthou, 1999; Garcia-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000). Pumpkinseed now comprises more than 50% of the fish community by numbers. The displacement of the indigenous cyprinid community by such an exotic assemblage has been a common trend in Mediterranean lowland lakes (Almaga, 1995; Blanco et al., 2003).\nSampling strategy\nSampling was carried out twice: in November, during the annual turbid water phase, and in early spring (late March) in the clear water phase. These timings were chosen to accommodate a potential seasonal component of the spatial distribution pattern of the crustacean plankton. In November the macrophytes are senescent and the water is turbid, while March is the beginning of its growing period (low turbidity). Furthermore, these two\nperiods have different plankton assemblages, with November being dominated by smallsized species while a Daphnia is dominant in March. The summer was excluded from our sampling because Daphnia, which is the largest filter feeder and the most susceptible taxon to predation by fish, is usually absent or decline during this period.\nDiel samples were collected over three consecutive days at two depths (near the bottom and near the surface). Samples were taken at two contiguous sites (M and P): M was a littoral sampling station, situated at the edge of a large bed of Nymphaea alba, while P was in the adjacent (20-30-m distant from M) pelagic zone (closer to the centre of the lake). A small boat was used to minimise sediment resuspension. Composite zooplankton samples were collected with a transparent Van Dorn water sampler (horizontal) and poured through a 55-^m-mesh plankton net, until a volume of 16L was filtered. Collection was performed as quickly as possible to prevent possible avoidance by larger specimens. This procedure was repeated near the surface and close to the bottom, at three distinct sub-areas within each site. Each sample was immediately preserved in sucrose-saturated 4% formalin, stained with Bengal rose, and stored until further examination.\nIn November, daily sampling was carried out 5-6 hours before and after sunset, roughly corresponding to noon (day) and midnight (night), respectively. In March, sampling took place at a finer temporal resolution (every four hours: 8h, 12h, 16h, 20h, 24h, 4h). Sampling at 8h and 20h corresponded roughly to sunrise and sunset, respectively.\nSample processing and analysis\nZooplankton samples were sorted and counted under a stereozoom microscope. Cladocerans were identified to genus and cyclopoid copepods were separated into nauplii and copepods (copepodites + adults). Counting by subsampling was used for the most abundant taxa, with at least 100 individuals of the dominant zooplankton species being counted and the total number of counts always being higher than 400. When necessary, the whole sample was screened in order to count large organisms (especially Daphnia).\nIn spring (March), an additional parameter was quantified: in order to assess the distribution of the different size classes of Daphnia, their average body size in each combination of treatments (site x depth x sampling time x day) was estimated by measuring a random subsample of 50 individuals in each replicate sample. Size at maturity (SAM) was determined according to Caramujo et al. (1997), at each combination of site\nStatistical analysis\nData were analysed using a repeated measures (RM) ANOVA, with the sampled sub-areas within each site as the subjects. The analyses were carried out for each day independently, as a means to simplify the statistical design (by reducing the number of factors and interactions) but also to assess if the distribution patterns observed were consistent for the three days. Since this artificial separation was decided merely for statistical convenience, the associated significance level of the family-wise Type I error was adjusted using the Dunn-Sidak procedure (Quinn &amp; Keough, 2002), for a total of three comparisons (one per day) for each parameter. A significance level of 0.017 was therefore used in all analyses. The between-subjects factors of the RM ANOVA were site (P vs. M) and depth (surface vs. bottom), while the within-subject factor was time of the day (day vs. night). The density data matrix from the spring campaign was reduced to the temporal resolution of that of the autumn campaign (noon and midnight sampling), so that the statistical conclusions could be compared between both surveys. Additionally, a RM ANOVA was also applied to the high temporal resolution data, using time of the day (day vs. night) and hour (8h vs. 12h vs. 16h and 20h vs. 24h vs. 4h) as within-subjects factors. The data on the size distribution of Daphnia (body size and proportion of adults) were analysed using the latter procedure alone, since no comparison between spring and autumn was required. Because of deviations to multisample sphericity (measured by e), the degrees of freedom were adjusted in the RM ANOVA procedure for the high resolution data, using either the Greenhouse-Geisser (if e<0.75) or the Huynh-Feldt (if e>0.75) estimate (Quinn &amp; Keough, 2002). Prior to all statistical analyses, the zooplankton density data were log-transformed, log (x+1), and the proportion of adults (Daphnia) was arcsine square-root transformed, arcsin (Vx), in order to comply with sample normality.\nResults\nThe physical and chemical environment of Lake Vela was homogeneous across depth, day period and site during the both sampling campaigns. Chlorophyll a (chl a) was\nthe most variable parameter, exhibiting large fluctuations (particularly between days), although with no consistent spatial or temporal pattern. Given the lack of patterns, only the range of the parameters recorded during this study is shown (Table 4.1). Water depth was similar at both sites and varied between 1.0 m (autumn) and 1.6 m (spring). The temperature was still quite high in November (unusual for the season), exceeding those observed in March. The two sampling periods represented two different phases in the lake: in November, the lake was characterised by low transparency and high concentrations of TP and chl a, while in March the water was less turbid and chl a lower (Table 4.1).\nThe zooplankton community also differed between the two seasons. In November, copepod nauplii were the most abundant crustacean zooplankters (range 186-1148 L-1), followed by Chydorus (69-825 L-1). Bosmina (74-391 L-1) and cyclopoid copepods (41-343 L-1) were also common, while Daphnia were scarce (1.5-13 L-1). Other taxa (Ceriodaphnia, Moina, Iliocryptus, Alona, and predator Chaoborus) were observed in very low numbers (&lt;2 L-1). In March, the crustacean zooplankton was less dense overall and less diverse, being mainly dominated by cyclopoid copepods (range 94-695 L-1) and Daphnia (31-245 L-1). Chydorus was also present in low numbers (0.5-42 L-1). A few copepod nauplii were observed, as well as other cladocerans (Bosmina, Simocephalus).\nTable 4.1 \u2022 Range of physical and chemical parameters measured during the two sampling campaigns.\nParameter\tNovember\tMarch\nWater depth (m)\t1.0\t1.6\nSecchi depth (m)\t0.30\t0.75\nWater temperature (\u00b0C)\t19 - 22\t12 - 16\nTP (mg P L-1)\t0.31 - 0.38\t0.13 - 0.15\nChlorophyll a (pg L-1)\t107 - 267\t30 - 89\nTurbid water phase (autumn)\nThe weather remained calm and sunny with a few clouds for the three consecutive days.

On most days, there was a significant interaction between the three factors (time of the day x depth x site), but no obvious trend was visible (Figure 4.1). No difference in the overall average density was found between sites, except on day 3 (Table 4.2), when density was higher at M.\nNo consistent statistical differences among days were found for Chydorus or Bosmina (Table 4.2), confirmed by the lack of a consistent pattern of habitat selection patterns (Figure 4.1). No differences in the overall average densities were found between sites, except in day 2 for Chydorus (M>P) and day 3 for Bosmina (P>M) (Table 4.2). Data on the distribution pattern of Daphnia were more consistent (i.e., statistically more coherent) than for the other taxa (Table 4.2). No significant differences were found between site, depth, time of the day or in their interactions, suggesting a homogeneous distribution pattern along the vertical, horizontal and diurnal gradients. The only exception was recorded on day 3, where a significant overall effect of site was observed, with Daphnia density being higher in P than in M (Figure 4.1).\nClear water phase (spring)\nIn general, the weather was calm and partially sunny, except on the afternoon of day 3, when there was strong wind and heavy rain. The distribution patterns of the most abundant zooplanktonic taxa are presented in Figure 4.2. For copepods, a significant effect of time of the day was found on all days (Table 4.3), as seen by an increase in copepod density during the night, which was more noticeable at P. A similar pattern was observed in Chydorus, with a consistent significance of time of the day and time x site interaction over the three days (Table 4.3). This site-dependent effect of time of the day is visible in Figure 4.2, because there was an increase in density at night, which was more noticeable and consistent at P. No consistent statistical difference between sites was recorded in the overall density of copepods or chydorids, although copepods exhibited higher overall density at P.\n(B z-s\nP\nsurface bottom\nE E\n\"O o -Q\n\u25a02\nFigure 4.2 \u2022 Diel variation of mean (\u00b1SE) zooplankton densities and Daphnia size-structure during the spring campaign (clear water phase). M (macrophyte) and P (pelagic) represent adjacent sites, which were sampled at two depths. The bars on the x-axis represent day (white) and night (black) sampling periods.\nFor Daphnia, no consistent significant effects were found for any factor (Table 4.3), although there was a significant effect of site on days 2 and 3. In fact, Daphnia density was slightly higher at in site P than at site M (Figure 4.2). Time of the day x depth interaction was only significant at day 3 (Table 4.3). In general terms, the analysis of the low and high temporal resolution data (see Methods - statistical analysis) produced a similar statistical output, with Daphnia being an exception, due to a consistent effect of depth on the high resolution, but not in the low resolution data.

This suggests that Lake Vela is frequently mixed,\nconfirming it as a polymictic lake. The absence of physical and chemical gradients that provide directional cues presumably constrains habitat selection by the zooplankton while the efficiency of any vertical refuge must be limited in such a shallow lake. Hence, the overall inconsistency in the distribution patterns of the zooplankton, particularly across the vertical axis, was not surprising. Nevertheless, some small-scale patterns were recorded. There were two main problems with the density data: first, densities along the horizontal and vertical axes were fairly similar, possibly as the result of the continuous mixing of the shallow water column; secondly, zooplankton differed markedly between replicate samples, indicating micro-scale patchiness. In part, variability in the zooplankton density data may be due to the limitations of classical sampling methodologies in assessing spatial patchiness. The use of zooplankton traps (Wojtal et al., 2003) and particularly of acoustic surveys (Hembre &amp; Megard, 2003) may help to resolve such fine patterns.\nIn autumn, no consistent patterns were observed in the spatial distribution of most zooplankton taxa, either horizontal or vertical, except for copepod nauplii. The distribution pattern of nauplii in the pelagic site (P) suggests daily vertical migration pattern (DVM), with a higher density near the bottom during the day and a more uniform distribution at night. The classical DVM pattern implies a higher density near the surface at night (Dodson, 1990; Han &amp; Straskraba, 2001), but the homogeneous depth distribution at night presumably results from the absence of vertical environmental gradients (temperature, food), which is typical in shallow lakes (Gilbert &amp; Hampton, 2001). Since nauplii are not very susceptible to fish predation, due to their small dimensions, we interpret these findings as a potential defence against invertebrate predators, as seen by Gilbert &amp; Hampton (2001). The only pelagic invertebrate predator we found was Chaoborus sp., which has been shown to be a more efficient predator in the light, thus inducing diurnal swarming in zooplankton Kvam &amp; Kleiven (1995). In the macrophyte bed (M), nauplii preferred the bottom layer rather than migrating, which could be a response against macrophyte-associated invertebrate predators foraging below the lily pads.\nIn the spring, the densities of copepods and chydorids was greater by night at both sites (though more obvious at P), independently of depth. The most reasonable explanation is that these taxa migrate vertically, aggregating near the bottom by day and rising to the surface at dusk, attaining a more homogeneous distribution at night (as observed by Jeppesen et al., 2002). We failed to detect aggregation near the bottom, because we could\nnot sample the first few centimetres above the sediment, where zooplankton have been seen during the day (Jeppesen et al., 2002). Data on Daphnia density did not reveal a vertical migration, although a preference for the deeper layer by day was apparent. The spatial pattern of the body size distribution of daphniids showed that large individuals aggregated near the bottom. The small-scale daily vertical migration by copepods and chydorids, and the vertical habitat selection exhibited by adult Daphnia, has been reported in the few studies conducted in shallow lakes (Gilbert &amp; Hampton, 2001; Jeppesen et al.,\n2002). Fish predation risk is the most likely trigger of vertical heterogeneity in our study, especially considering that larger and more susceptible daphniids avoided the surface by day.\nIn recent years, really clear water has not been seen in Lake Vela, in spite of mild and/or transient clear water phases such as the one shown here. This presumably accounts for the reduced success of submerged macrophytes. Nevertheless, the differences observed between autumn and spring still suggest that transparency was a major factor dictating the vulnerability of zooplankton to visual predators (such as fish), as found by other authors (e.g. Dodson, 1990; Alonso et al., 2004). We only found vertical heterogeneity in zooplankton, as a defence against fish, in spring, when transparency was higher; however, predation pressure was higher in autumn, because of high temperatures and the presence of summer-born (YOY) fish. This confirms the need of a light gradient (Ringelberg &amp; Van Gool, 2003) to induce vertical heterogeneity, which does not seem to occur in turbid phases or in permanently turbid lakes, despite intense predatory pressure.\nOverall, copepod density in spring was consistently higher in the pelagic (P), suggesting the avoidance of macrophytes. The mean body length of Daphnia, and the proportion of adults, was also greater in the pelagic samples on two of the three sampling days in spring. This apparent \u201cshore-avoidance\u201d behaviour of copepods and large daphniids could be due to the repellence of littoral macrophytes, which is well documented in the literature (e.g. Lauridsen &amp; Lodge, 1996; Burks et al., 2000; Burks et al., 2001). In addition, there is also evidence that the lower abundance of zooplankton in the littoral is related to higher predation by fish in these areas (Hulsmann et al., 1999). In fact, we frequently observed small fish swimming within the protection of the water lily leaves and field studies have shown that the mosquitofish is strictly littoral (Cabral et al., 1998; Garcia-Berthou, 1999) while small pumpkinseed are also mainly littoral (Garcia-Berthou\n&amp;\tMoreno-Amich, 2000). Data on Daphnia suggest that larger specimens were less common in macrophytes, which could indicate size-selective predation in macrophyte beds. This is a typical indicator of fish predation (Gliwicz, 1994). The suppression of large zooplankton in macrophytes has been termed \u201dfish-mediated shore-avoidance\u201d (Lauridsen et al., 2001), which is contrary to the idea that macrophytes provide a refuge for zooplankton against fish predators, as reported for most studies in temperate lakes (Kvam &amp; Kleiven, 1995; Lauridsen &amp; Buenk, 1996; Jeppesen et al., 1998; Masson et al., 2001; Burks et al., 2002; Wojtal et al., 2003). Burks et al. (2002) had already hypothesized that DHM might not be an efficient mechanism in lakes where littoral planktivores (namely mosquitofish) thrive. This hypothesis has been supported for some subtropical and tropical systems (Burks et al., 2002; Meerhoff et al., 2006), and our results suggest that the zooplankton from Mediterranean shallow lakes may also experience higher predation risks in littoral macrophytes.\nThe spring campaign showed horizontal habitat selection, especially by large daphniids, while no patterns were observed in the autumn. As previously discussed, behavioural anti-predator defences were heightened in the clear water phase, presumably due to the presence of a vertical light gradient. However, transparency is not a reasonable argument to explain the difference observed in the horizontal spatial patterns between spring and autumn. These differences are dependent on macrophyte-associated factors, such as the production of allellopathical substances and, more importantly, the foraging ability of invertebrate or vertebrate predators within the macrophytes. Such macrophyte-associated factors are likely to have a strong seasonal component related to factors other than transparency (e.g. macrophyte cover; see Schriver et al., 1995; Burks et al., 2001).\nReferences\nAlma\u00e7a C.

The two fish species used represent the most abundant planktivores of many Mediterranean shallow lakes (SW Europe), where the indigenous fish communities have been replaced by such exotic assemblages. Results have shown a similar response of D. longispina to both fish species: kairomones stimulated daphniids to produce more offspring, which resulted in higher fitness (r), relatively to a fishless control. Fish presence also induced an earlier first reproduction, a smaller size at maturity of daphniids, and the production of smaller-sized neonates. Significant correlations with fish concentration (indirect measure of fish kairomone concentration) were found for size at maturity and neonate size, for both fish species. These results are in accordance to the \u201cpositive response\u201d observed by other authors, which represents a defence mechanism to face losses caused by fish predators. The chemically-mediated size reduction of mature females and neonates is an adaptive response to the size-selective predation exerted by fish. Pumpkinseed introduction is very recent in the lake of origin of the daphniids used in the experiments and its kairomone produced similar effects to mosquitofish in the life history of D. longispina. These results are contrary to the existence of a species-specific cue and support the hypothesis of a general fish kairomone.\nKEYWORDS\nDaphnia, life history responses, fish kairomones, Gambusia holbrooki, Lepomis gibbosus\nIntroduction\nDaphniids react to predators by increasing their fecundity (life history shifts) and/or by reducing their mortality (morphological and behavioural defences), thus increasing their fitness under predation regimes. These phenotypic responses are chemically induced (see review by Lass &amp; Spaak, 2003) and seem to represent a compromise between the least costly and the most effective antipredator defence strategy (Boersma et al., 1998; De Meester &amp; Weider, 1999; Sakwinska &amp; Dawidowicz, 2005). Many examples of chemically-induced antipredator defences, for both invertebrate and vertebrate (fish) predators, are present in the literature. We will focus on vertebrate predators, as they seem to be the main driving force in shaping the zooplanktonic communities in shallow lakes, by exerting a strong top-down control (Jeppesen et al., 1997).\nMorphological alterations in response to fish chemical cues include the induction of longer tail spines (Spaak &amp; Boersma, 1997; Stabell et al., 2003) and the modification of body (Weber &amp; Vesela, 2002) and head shape (Weber &amp; Vesela, 2002; Stabell et al.,\n2003). The reduction of body size (Engelmayer, 1995; De Meester &amp; Weider, 1999; Sakwinska, 2000; Weber, 2003; Sakwinska &amp; Dawidowicz, 2005) is also frequently observed in Daphnia exposed to fish chemical cues or kairomones. Antipredator behavioural responses allow daphniids to react to predator presence within a short period of time (De Meester &amp; Cousyn, 1997; Lass &amp; Spaak, 2003) and include avoidance or escape abilities (Pijanowska &amp; Kowalczewski, 1997; Roozen &amp; Lurling, 2001), changes in phototactic behaviour (De Meester &amp; Cousyn, 1997; Van Gool &amp; Ringelberg, 2002; Michels &amp; De Meester, 2004), depth selection (Dodson, 1988; De Meester &amp; Cousyn, 1997; Weber &amp; van Noordwijk, 2002), changes in swimming speed (Pijanowska &amp; Kowalczewski, 1997; Weber &amp; van Noordwijk, 2002), and aggregation or swarming formation (Pijanowska &amp; Kowalczewski, 1997; Roozen &amp; Lurling, 2001). Ultimately, these simple predator-induced behaviours constitute the basis of more complex migratory phenomena, such as diel vertical (DVM) or diel horizontal (DHM) migration (Lass &amp; Spaak, 2003).\nLife history shifts in the presence of fish predators have received considerable attention in the recent literature. However, Daphnia life history responses to fish chemical cues are still somewhat contradictory. Negative responses, i.e. reduced fecundity or delayed reproduction, have been observed by some authors (Burks et al., 2000; Hanazato et al., 2001). However, the most usual response pattern is an early maturation (decrease in age and size at maturity), as well as a production of larger clutches of smaller neonates, resulting in higher fitness (r) (e.g. Engelmayer, 1995; Reede, 1997; Sakwinska, 2000; Weber, 2003; Hulsmann et al., 2004). Size and age at maturity are considered to be the most affected traits (Hulsmann et al., 2004) and this scenario clearly represents an adaptive response to the positive size-selective predation exerted by fish. However, no effects of fish kairomones on size or age at maturity of Daphnia were found in the studies by Sakwinska (1998) and Michels and De Meester (2004), for example. Weber (2003) considered that the heterogeneity in the life history responses of Daphnia to different fish species poses new challenges when considering the effects of each specific planktivore assemblage on the zooplankton populations.\nBearing this in mind, a life history experiment was performed to assess the responses of Daphnia longispina to chemical cues exuded by its main predators in shallow Lake Vela. This is a shallow polymictic lake, where daphniids undergo very high predation pressures from two invasive fish species: mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) In fact, pumpkinseed is presently the most relevant planktivore/omnivore in many other Mediterranean shallow lakes (Garc\u00eda-Berthou &amp; Moreno-Amich, 2000; Blanco et al., 2003), having displaced the indigenous cyprinid community. In Portugal, the pumpkinseed invasion is much more recent than that of mosquitofish (Almaga, 1995), especially in lentic systems. In Lake Vela, pumpkinseed was introduced in the late 1990s and, since then, it has become the dominant taxon (J. Vingada, personal communication). Mosquitofish probably exists in Lake Vela since the early 1900s, as a result of introductions related to malaria control programs. Diet analysis of these two fish species in Lake Vela confirmed a high degree of planktivory, but they do not rely exclusively on zooplankton as food items (Castro et al., submitted manuscript1). The impact of pumpkinseed on zooplankton is higher than that of mosquitofish, mainly because the latter is restricted to the littoral and is partially gape-limited in respect to Daphnia as a prey item. The aims of this study were: 1) to assess how D. longispina responds to the presence of predators cues from mosquitofish and pumkinseed; 2) to verify if this effect is linearly dependent on the concentration of fish chemical cue; and 3) to determine if these two fish species shift the life history of D. longispina differently, given their distinctive features and introduction timings.\nMaterials and methods\nTest organisms\nMonoclonal cultures of D. longispina (clone EV20, sensu Antunes et al., 2003) were established from an ephippial egg coming from the eutrophic Lake Vela. This lake sustains large and seasonal populations of Daphnia, which are subjected to very high predatory pressure from fish, particularly pumpkinseed. Bulk group cultures of synchronous single-cohort daphniids have been asexually reared for several generations under a 16:8 hr light:dark cycle and a temperature of 20 \u00b1 2\u00b0C. Organisms were maintained in ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials, USA) synthetic hardwater medium\n1 Cap\u00edtulo 2 da tese\nenriched with a standard organic additive (Ascophyllum nodosum extract; Baird et al.,\n1989). Medium was renewed every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Food (Selenastrum capricornutum, presently Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata) was added daily at a final concentration of 1.5 x 105 cells mL-1. Offspring from the first two clutches were discarded and neonates from the 3rd-5th clutch were used either in the life table experiments or for renewing the group cultures.\nThe actual taxonomic position of D. longispina records in Portugal is unclear, due to high morphological variation and interspecific hybridisation within the species complex (D. longispina, D. galeata and D. cucullata) (Schwenk et al., 1998; Giessler et al., 1999; Billiones et al., 2004). The ITS-RFLP pattern (Billiones et al., 2004) of the clone used in these experiments was concordant to that of D. longispina (Petrusek et al., 2005).\nFish-conditioned water\nMosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) and pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) were caught one week before the experiments in Lake Vela. Fish-conditioned water was obtained by maintaining either 5 juvenile L. gibbosus (average size: 45 mm TL; average wet weight: 1.1 g) or 10 adult G. holbrooki (average size: 35 mm TL; average wet weight: 0.34 g) in 10-L aquaria for 24 hrs in ASTM hard water medium. Fish concentrations (fish L-1) in the aquaria were established in order to obtain approximate fish loads (biomass per L) between both species. A third aquarium was prepared containing only culture medium, without any fish (i.e. kairomone-free). Each day, 2 L of water (i.e. 20%) from each aquarium were removed, filtered through a 1.2-^m glass fibre filter, and used in the life table experiments with D. longispina (see below). The aquaria were then refilled with fresh medium. Prior to these procedures, fish were transferred to a smaller aquarium, where they were allowed to feed for 5-10 minutes on live D. longispina and chironomids, simulating their normal diet in the field (Castro et al., submitted manuscript). A separate feeding aquarium is important in order to minimise the potential influence of chemical cues released by crushed Daphnia (Pijanowska &amp; Kowalczewski, 1997; Slusarczyk &amp; Rygielska, 2004). Fish were returned to their original aquarium after medium transfer was completed. Oxygen (WTW portable oxygen meter) and ammonia (Nessler method) levels in the aquaria were monitored continuously for the duration of the experiment, since\nLife table experiments\nExperiments were conducted for 14 days under the same temperature and photoperiod regimes as described for the rearing procedures (see above). Life table experiments were initiated with first-instar daphniids (<24-hr-old neonates). A semi-static design was employed, using 10 individual animals randomly assigned to each experimental treatment: no fish or control (CTL), Gambusia-conditioned water (0.20, 0.50, 1.0 fish L-1) and Lepomis-conditioned water (0.10, 0.25, 0.50 fish L-1), resulting in 7 (treatments) x 10 (replicates) = 70 jars with individual daphniids. Water from the fishless aquarium (i.e. kairomone-free) was used as the control and as the dilution water for fish kairomone treatments. Test media (50 mL per organism) were renewed on a daily basis to maintain kairomone concentration as high as possible, because the breakdown of these signals seems to occur in a few hours (Dodson, 1988). Organic additive (see rearing procedures under Test organisms) and food (1.5 x 105 cells mL-1) were supplied daily, concurrently with medium renewal. Animals were daily checked for mortality and reproductive state and, when neonates were released, they were immediately counted and discarded. The following parameters were registered: total number of offspring per female, total number of broods per female and age at first reproduction (AFR). Body size measurements were performed on the test organisms (mothers) on the day they released the first batch of eggs in the brood pouch (size at maturity) and at the end of the experiment (body length at day 14). Additionally, body size measurements on the neonates from the first clutch were also performed (neonate size). Survival and fecundity estimates were used to compute the intrinsic rate of population increase (r), also called per capita rate of increase (Meyer et al., 1986). This demographic parameter was iterated from the Euler-Lotka equation:\nn\n1 = \u00a3 e-\u201c l,\nx=0\nStatistical analysis\nTo test the significance of the effect of fish (i.e. kairomone) presence and concentration on the life history of the daphniids, a one-way ANOVA was employed to each of the life history parameters, followed by a Dunnett test (post-hoc comparisons against the control group). A repeated measures ANOVA was used to test for differences between the experimental treatments in the number of offspring produced in the first three clutches (using clutch as the repeated measurement). Whenever an interaction between clutch and fish concentration was found, a test for simple main effects of fish concentration within each clutch was carried out using the within-cells error term as the denominator for the F test (Quinn &amp; Keough, 2002). Occasionally, deviations from homogeneity of variances or normality were detected, but we assumed the ANOVAs to be robust to these deviations. Experimental treatments for each fish species were analysed independently. The Pearson product moment coefficient was used as a correlation measure between the life history parameters and fish concentration (log-transformed), as a way to assess whether the effect of fish kairomones on the life history of D. longispina was concentration-dependent. A fixed significance level (a) of 0.05 was used in all analyses.\nResults\nDuring the course of the experiment, ammonia levels were gradually increasing over time. Although there were differences between treatments, ammonia (NH4+) concentrations were still fairly low: CTL - 0.04-0.08 mg L-1; mosquitofish-conditioned water - 0.16-0.38 mg L-1; pumpkinseed-conditioned water - 0.33-0.85 mg L-1.\nSignificant effects of fish cue concentration were observed in all of the D. longispina life-history parameters for both pumpkinseed and mosquitofish. A similar pattern of response was obtained for the two fish species (Figures 5.1 and 5.2). Size at maturity was significantly reduced for all of the tested mosquitofish concentrations (ANOVA: F = 10.2; d.f. = 3, 35; P &lt;0.001) and for the two highest pumpkinseed concentrations (ANOVA: F = 6.63; d.f. = 3, 36; P = 0.001). Neonate body size (from the first clutch) was also significantly reduced. For mosquitofish kairomone, a significant\nreduction was found for the 0.50 and 1.0 fish L-1 concentrations (ANOVA: F = 5.25; d.f. = 3, 35; P = 0.004) and for pumpkinseed kairomone this was observed at the highest concentration - 0.50 fish L-1 (ANOVA: F = 9.59; d.f. = 3, 36; P &lt;0.001). Body length at day 14 was significantly affected by mosquitofish cue (ANOVA: F = 3.17; d.f. = 3, 35; P = 0.036), but no significant differences were observed in relation to the control (see Figure 5.1). In the pumpkinseed treatments, body length revealed to be significantly stimulated (ANOVA: F = 4.02; d.f. = 3, 35; P = 0.015) in the lowest concentrations (0.10 and 0.25 fish L-1). Earlier reproduction was observed as a consequence of fish presence, as seen by a significant depression of age at first reproduction in all kairomone concentrations, for both mosquitofish (ANOVA: F = 11.5; d.f. = 3, 35; P &lt;0.001) and pumpkinseed (ANOVA: F = 16.0; d.f. = 3, 36; P &lt;0.001). In contrast, the total number of offspring produced by female D. longispina was significantly increased by both fish kairomones (mosquitofish -ANOVA: F = 34.5; d.f. = 3, 35; P &lt;0.001; pumpkinseed - ANOVA: F = 128; d.f. = 3, 35; P &lt;0.001), in all tested concentrations. A similar response was found in the number of broods, with mosquitofish (ANOVA: F = 90.7; d.f. = 3, 35; P &lt;0.001) and pumpkinseed (ANOVA: F = 6.55 x 104; d.f. = 3, 35; P &lt;0.001) cues causing a significant enhancement.\nSize at maturity\nNeonate size\nBody length\nAFR\tOffspring\tBroods\nFish (Gambusia holbrooki) concentration (fish L-1)\nFigure 5.1 \u2022 Mean life history responses of Daphnia longispina exposed to several concentrations of mosquitofish (G. holbrooki) kairomones: size at maturity, neonate size, body length at day 14, age at first reproduction (AFR), total number of offspring per female and total number of broods per female.

Asterisks (*) stand for statistically significant differences relatively to the kairomone-free control (CTL).\nSince the development of the daphniids was enhanced by kairomones (as observed by earlier reproduction), a fourth clutch was usually produced in the experimental\ntreatments, but not in the control. To assess if the observed differences in fecundity (Figures 5.1 and 5.2) were due to the production of this additional clutch, the fecundity data for the first three clutches alone were analysed. No differences were found between the mosquitofish concentrations, pooling the first three clutches, but the P value was marginal (Table 5.1). Significant differences were found for pumpkinseed concentration, and a significant interaction between clutch and concentration was observed (Table 5.1). Simple main effects testing showed that fish kairomone significantly enhanced neonate production only in the second and third clutch (Figure 5.4).\nTable 5.1 \u2022 Summary of the repeated measures ANOVAs applied to the fecundity data (number of offspring produced in the first three clutches) of Daphnia longispina exposed to fish kairomones.\nGambusia holbrooki\tLepomis gibbosus\nSource of variation\n\tF\td.f.\tP\tF\td.f.\tP\nBetween subjects\t\t\t\t\t\t\nconcentration\t2.68\t3, 35\t0.062\t17.1\t3, 35\t<0.001\nWithin subjects\t\t\t\t\t\t\nclutch\t542\t2, 70\t<0.001\t514\t2, 70\t<0.001\nclutch x concentration\t1.39\t6, 70\t0.230\t3.08\t6, 70\t0.010\nG. holbrooki\nI\tI\tCTL\nI\tI\t0.20 fish L-1\nI\tI\t0.50 fish L-1\n1.00 fish L-1\nL. gibbosus\nI\tI\tCTL\nI\tI\t0.10 fish L-1\nI\tI\t0.25 fish L-1\n0.50 fish L-1\n1 st clutch\n2nd clutch\n3rd clutch\nTable 5.2 \u2022 Correlation coefficients (Pearson product moment) and associated significance between the life history parameters of Daphnia longispina exposed to fish kairomones and log fish concentration.

These results are in accordance to the \u201cpositive response\u201d (Hanazato et al., 2001) observed by other authors (e.g. Engelmayer, 1995; Reede, 1997; Sakwinska, 2000; Weber, 2003; Hulsmann et al., 2004), which represents an adaptive mechanism to face losses caused by fish predators. Additionally, daphniids exposed to fish cues in the present study attained a smaller size at maturity and produced smaller-sized offspring. This chemically-mediated body size reduction of mature females and neonates is an adaptive response to the positive size-selective predation exerted by fish, as reported by other authors (Engelmayer, 1995; De Meester &amp; Weider, 1999; Sakwinska, 2000; Weber, 2003; Sakwinska &amp; Dawidowicz, 2005; von Elert &amp; Stibor, 2006). This is further enhanced by the fact that mother and neonate body size parameters (except body length at day 14) were affected in a concentration-dependent manner (see Table 5.2). Although exposure to kairomone also affected other life history parameters, this effect did not seem to be related with concentration. Fish presence alone seemed to be sufficient to induce certain plastic traits, independently of the strength (i.e. concentration) of the kairomone.\nHigher NH4+ concentrations were observed in the fish treatments in comparison to the control, especially in pumpkinseed-conditioned water. However, the observed levels were not very high (&lt;1.0 mg L-1). Lurling et al. (2003) showed that such ammonia levels do not produce effects on the life history of Daphnia comparable to those induced by conspecifics. However, they do recognise that ammonia may alter \u201cnegatively\u201d the life history responses of Daphnia. This could lead to false \u201cnegative\u201d responses of daphniids exposed to fish-conditioned water in the literature. Some other \u201cnegative\u201d responses (see e.g. Hanazato et al., 2001), on the other hand, could result as a consequence of metabolic costs associated to the induction of behavioural or morphological defences in response to fish presence. In the present study, no visible alterations in D. longispina morphology were observed at the tested concentrations.\nBody length at day 14 gave an unexpected and contradictory result. Growth seemed to be stimulated in the kairomone treatments in relation to the control, even after a smaller size at maturity of these experimental animals had been observed. This may be a consequence of the early maturation of daphniids under predator presence: they accelerate their development in order to mature at an earlier age and at a smaller size and consequently, they achieve a higher number of adult instars in the same period of time, because they start reproducing earlier in the presence of predators. This lead to the production of an additional brood in animals exposed to kairomones. We hypothesize that, for the same adult instar, daphniids under fish threat will present a smaller body size. However, daphniids at the end of our experiment were not in the same adult instar (as seen by the number of broods produced). To avoid this experimental bias, a moulting log should have been kept (by recording exuviae) or daily measures on body size should have been taken. It seems reasonable to conclude that this apparent adult growth stimulation is an indirect effect of fish kairomones. A larger adult body length seems to be counterproductive, making Daphnia more vulnerable to visually-oriented predators, unlike what was observed for other traits (size at maturity, neonate size). At this age, however, body length is probably unimportant because daphniids are very conspicuous (> 2 mm) and are unlikely to be encountered under actual fish predation regimes.\nAlthough the general response to kairomones was similar between the two fish species used, daphniids exposed to pumpkinseed kairomone seemed to invest more in neonate production (see Figure 5.4). Weber (2003) also observed small discrepancies\nbetween the responses of Daphnia galeata clones to two different fish kairomones. This author interpreted these findings as an argument in favour of one of two hypotheses: i) the existence of several species-specific fish kairomones; ii) the existence of a chemical mixture of substances, rather than an isolated compound, thus increasing the complexity of its effects. The existence of species-specific kairomones could imply that Daphnia would not be responsive to kairomones from recently introduced fish, such as pumpkinseed. This is not the case in our study. Furthermore, Von Elert &amp; Stibor (2006) have shown that the chemical nature of the kairomone is similar between some fish species, being comprised by a mixture of substances. The results of Stabell et al. (2003) gave a strong indication that fish kairomones may be latent alarm cues from Daphnia, resulting from the digestion of conspecifics by fish. Even when an exotic fish species was used by these authors, morphological alterations were observed in Daphnia only when the predator had been previously fed daphniids. The findings of Slusarczyk and Rygielska (2004) further supported this and showed that fish faeces were the primary source of kairomones, which were able to induce diapause in Daphnia. These findings support the theory of a universal chemical cue (or mixture of chemical cues) that results from the activation of a latent alarm signal of preyed Daphnia in the fish digestive tract. Slight differences between fish species (such as for mosquitofish and pumpkinseed in the present study) are therefore more likely to be explained as a result of variability in fish behaviour and feeding habits/metabolism (e.g. gut passage time), which may be important in defining the strength of the kairomone. Recent findings (von Elert &amp; Stibor, 2006) suggest that the effects of fish cues may be even more complex to interpret, as shown by the differential induction of Daphnia antipredator defences (behaviour and life history) by different fractions of a kairomone produced by Leuciscus idus.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the effects of these two fish species on the life history responses of Daphnia. Mosquitofish has long been present in southern Europe, but pumpkinseed was only recently introduced in Lake Vela. However, their presence shifted the life history parameters of D. longispina in the same direction. In fact, pumpkinseed kairomone enhanced the fecundity of D. longispina more drastically than mosquitofish (see Figure 5.4). These results contribute to the idea of a non-specific fish kairomone, leading to an adaptive \u201cpositive\u201d response of daphniids to substantial mortality due to size-selective predation by fish. The experimental design used here could\nnot test whether the kairomone resulted from preyed Daphnia, because a treatment where no daphniids were fed to the fish is missing. Nonetheless, results clearly show the adaptive value of chemical communication in predator-prey signalling systems, which is maintained even with a recently introduced predator.\nInducible defences are an example of the importance of predation as a selective force, driving the evolution of life history, behavioural and morphological traits of the prey. In Daphnia, these traits present considerable phenotypic plasticity, which allows daphniids to adapt to changes in their environment. Chemical signals, such as fish kairomones, play a vital role as cues for daphniids to undergo adaptive life history shifts. Still, the ecological significance of kairomone-induced life history responses is complex. On one hand, there seems to be a compromise between different types of inducible defences (Boersma et al., 1998; De Meester &amp; Weider, 1999; Sakwinska &amp; Dawidowicz,\n2005). On the other hand, the interpretation of the effects of fish kairomones on the life history traits of cladocerans is complicated by its interaction with additional factors, such as food level (Reede, 1997; Weber, 2001; Hulsmann et al., 2004) and temperature (Sakwinska, 1998). Further research should focus on these interactions and also on the direct and indirect costs associated with induced life history shifts, such as the production of smaller neonates (indirect effect), which are less resistant to starvation (Gliwicz &amp; Guisande, 1992) and to contaminant exposure (Enserink et al., 1990), for example. There is also experimental evidence that the presence of predators directly reduces the tolerance of cladocerans to food shortage (Weber, 2001; Hanazato et al., 2001) and contaminants (Rose et al., 2001).\nREFERENCES\nAlma\u00e7a C.

Por norma, este tipo de estudos carece de hip\u00f3teses concretas \u00e0 partida e n\u00e3o permite o controlo das vari\u00e1veis, o que diminui a sua relev\u00e2ncia e originalidade. Os estudos de natureza experimental, por outro lado, t\u00eam uma maior receptividade na comunidade cient\u00edfica (consoante a originalidade, naturalmente) e integram todas as fases do m\u00e9todo cient\u00edfico. Todavia, em algumas circunst\u00e2ncias, as provas emp\u00edricas proporcionadas pelos estudos descritivos representam informa\u00e7\u00e3o original, contribuindo com novo conhecimento para a tem\u00e1tica em quest\u00e3o. Este cen\u00e1rio verifica-se, por exemplo, na aus\u00eancia de informa\u00e7\u00e3o pr\u00e9via sobre a regi\u00e3o/habitat estudado ou no caso de se utilizarem ferramentas inovadoras. Os lagos pouco profundos da Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica enquadram-se no primeiro caso, como resultado da conjuga\u00e7\u00e3o da reduzida implementa\u00e7\u00e3o hist\u00f3rica da Limnologia na Pen\u00ednsula Ib\u00e9rica (Casado &amp; Montes, 1992) e da pouca aten\u00e7\u00e3o recebida pelos lagos pouco profundos (comparativamente aos lagos profundos e estratificados) at\u00e9 h\u00e1 umas d\u00e9cadas atr\u00e1s (Scheffer, 1998). Adicionalmente, e no caso concreto do local de estudo (Lagoa da Vela), o interesse \u00e9 ainda refor\u00e7ado pelo estado extremo de homogeneiza\u00e7\u00e3o da sua fauna pisc\u00edcola, que apresenta reduzida diversidade e domin\u00e2ncia de esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas como a perca-sol (Lepomis gibbosus), o achig\u00e3 (Micropterus salmoides), a gamb\u00fazia (Gambusia holbrooki) e a carpa (Cyprinus carpio). A problem\u00e1tica do impacto das esp\u00e9cies alien\u00edgenas representa uma preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o global e \u00e9 particularmente grave no caso das esp\u00e9cies de peixes de \u00e1gua doce (Cambray, 2003; Garcia-Berthou et al., 2005).\nPelos motivos acima indicados, a presente disserta\u00e7\u00e3o de doutoramento teve que, em parte, desenvolver uma componente descritiva. Esta op\u00e7\u00e3o foi tomada face ao conhecimento limitado sobre as interac\u00e7\u00f5es entre a comunidade zooplanct\u00f3nica e a ictiocenose alien\u00edgena. As evid\u00eancias hist\u00f3ricas e as publica\u00e7\u00f5es anteriores acerca da ecologia da Lagoa da Vela (e.g. Antunes et al., 2003; Abrantes et al., 2006a) sugeriam um papel estruturante da comunidade pisc\u00edcola actual sobre a din\u00e2mica do zoopl\u00e2ncton e da Lagoa como um todo. No entanto, nunca nenhum estudo havia integrado informa\u00e7\u00e3o de ambas as componentes (peixes e zoopl\u00e2ncton). Mais, desconhece-se outros estudos na Europa que tenham abordado com alguma profundidade esta problem\u00e1tica tendo como\nConsidera\u00e7\u00f5es finais\nbase uma ictiocenose com domin\u00e2ncia das esp\u00e9cies aqui relatadas, que representam tamb\u00e9m um problema de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da natureza, sobretudo no sul da Europa. Os dados resultantes da primeira parte do trabalho (Cap\u00edtulos 1-3) permitiram a formula\u00e7\u00e3o de hip\u00f3teses, sustentadas pela observa\u00e7\u00e3o das interac\u00e7\u00f5es entre os diversos n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos da Lagoa da Vela, sobretudo o elo peixes-zoopl\u00e2ncton. Algumas das quest\u00f5es levantadas foram testadas no \u00e2mbito desta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o, utilizando uma abordagem de cariz experimental (Cap\u00edtulos 4-5). Como em todos os trabalhos de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o, o presente estudo deixa ainda outras quest\u00f5es e desafios a serem respondidos no futuro.\npara al\u00e9m do interesse cient\u00edfico em compreender como funcionam as interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas que regulam o funcionamento deste ecossistema modificado, a relev\u00e2ncia deste estudo estende-se ainda para mat\u00e9rias de natureza mais aplicada, como a conserva\u00e7\u00e3o da fauna e gest\u00e3o da eutrofiza\u00e7\u00e3o. Mais, a evidente degrada\u00e7\u00e3o da qualidade da \u00e1gua e da biodiversidade das lagoas de Quiaios (Lagoa da Vela inclu\u00edda) compromete n\u00e3o s\u00f3 o valor ecol\u00f3gico da \u00e1rea, mas tamb\u00e9m a qualidade dos recursos h\u00eddricos para consumo humano (fins dom\u00e9sticos e agr\u00edcolas). Numa lagoa vizinha (Lagoa das Bra\u00e7as), por exemplo, existe um ponto de capta\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1gua que abastece parcialmente o concelho da Figueira da Foz. A par deste estudo, uma outra tese de doutoramento (Abrantes, em prepara\u00e7\u00e3o) est\u00e1 a ser produzida tamb\u00e9m com a Lagoa da Vela como objecto de estudo, mas abordando as fontes de contamina\u00e7\u00e3o difusa e os seus potenciais impactos (e.g. Abrantes et al., 2006b).\nDo ponto de vista ecol\u00f3gico, no que foi poss\u00edvel demonstrar ao longo dos cinco cap\u00edtulos desta disserta\u00e7\u00e3o, a Lagoa da Vela apresentou-se como um sistema controlado sobretudo por mecanismos de top-down. Tal n\u00e3o \u00e9 surpreendente dada a elevada disponibilidade de nutrientes para o crescimento fitoplanct\u00f3nico, que minimiza a sua influ\u00eancia (controlo bottom-up\\ Em lagos pouco profundos e eutr\u00f3ficos \u00e9 comum a press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria exercida pelos peixes ver a sua import\u00e2ncia aumentada enquanto factor modelador dos n\u00edveis tr\u00f3ficos inferiores (Jeppesen et al., 1997). Na aus\u00eancia de peixes planct\u00edvoros ind\u00edgenas, a press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria sobre o zoopl\u00e2ncton da Lagoa da Vela \u00e9 exercida por planct\u00edvoros pouco eficientes, como \u00e9 o caso da perca-sol (sobretudo), da gamb\u00fazia e dos juvenis de achig\u00e3. Estas esp\u00e9cies alien\u00edgenas exibem uma plasticidade assinal\u00e1vel na utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos alimentares dispon\u00edveis, alternando oportunistamente entre as componentes planct\u00f3nica e b\u00eantica (sobretudo larvas de d\u00edpteros), sem aparente comprometimento do seu sucesso na lagoa. os adultos de perca-sol destacaram-se pelo seu\nimpacto negativo em Daphnia durante a Primavera. Quando liberto da press\u00e3o predat\u00f3ria pelas baixas temperaturas, o zoopl\u00e2ncton (sobretudo Daphnia) contribuiu significativamente para a ocorr\u00eancia de uma fase de \u00e1gua transparente em Fevereiro e Mar\u00e7o, controlando o crescimento fitoplanct\u00f3nico de forma irregular e tempor\u00e1ria. Esta fase de \u00e1gua transparente nem sempre se tem verificado na Lagoa da Vela nos \u00faltimos anos e, no futuro, \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio compreender as flutua\u00e7\u00f5es inter-anuais da condi\u00e7\u00e3o da lagoa, inerentemente ligadas \u00e0s varia\u00e7\u00f5es no recrutamento dos peixes e \u00e0s flutua\u00e7\u00f5es hidrol\u00f3gicas.\nDurante a maior parte do ano, a Lagoa da Vela apresentou elevada turbidez e domin\u00e2ncia de zooplanctontes de pequenas dimens\u00f5es, incapazes de controlar a produ\u00e7\u00e3o fitoplanct\u00f3nica. Contudo, o papel das part\u00edculas em suspens\u00e3o para a transpar\u00eancia da lagoa tamb\u00e9m revelou ser determinante, o que vem ao encontro das sugest\u00f5es anteriores de afundamento da lagoa (como medida de mitiga\u00e7\u00e3o), de forma a incrementar o n\u00edvel da \u00e1gua (Pereira, 1997; Fernandes, 1999). O controlo da transpar\u00eancia \u00e9 vital na gest\u00e3o de lagos eutr\u00f3ficos pouco profundos, j\u00e1 que um estado de \u00e1gua transparente permite o crescimento de macr\u00f3fitas que, por sua vez, refor\u00e7am essa mesma transpar\u00eancia atrav\u00e9s de diversos mecanismos de histerese (Scheffer et al., 1993; Scheffer &amp; Jeppesen, 1998; Scheffer, 1998), como, por exemplo, a fixa\u00e7\u00e3o dos sedimentos, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de subst\u00e2ncias inibidoras do crescimento fitoplanct\u00f3nico (alelopatia), ou o consumo de nutrientes (competindo com o fitopl\u00e2ncton). \u00c9 nesse pressuposto que assenta a biomanipula\u00e7\u00e3o (Moss, 1992; Perrow et al., 1997; Scheffer, 1998), uma eco-ferramenta cuja efic\u00e1cia depende do conhecimento acerca das interac\u00e7\u00f5es tr\u00f3ficas entre peixes pisc\u00edvoros-planct\u00edvoros e peixes planct\u00edvoros-zoopl\u00e2ncton.\nNos lagos pouco profundos, a aus\u00eancia do ref\u00fagio hipolimn\u00e9tico (em profundidade) torna o zoopl\u00e2ncton particularmente suscept\u00edvel \u00e0 preda\u00e7\u00e3o. Contudo, em determinadas condi\u00e7\u00f5es, as macr\u00f3fitas podem providenciar ref\u00fagio adequado para os zooplanctontes destes sistemas (Jeppesen et al., 1998; Burks et al., 2002). Ficou aqui demonstrado que este efeito de ref\u00fagio n\u00e3o se verifica para as manchas de nen\u00fafar, na Lagoa da Vela. Esta observa\u00e7\u00e3o coincidiu com a utiliza\u00e7\u00e3o primordial das \u00e1reas estruturadas (vegeta\u00e7\u00e3o terrestre em decaimento, macr\u00f3fitas aqu\u00e1ticas, etc.) pelos peixes de menores dimens\u00f5es, sobretudo gamb\u00fazia (exclusivamente litoral) e juvenis de perca-sol. Perante as reduzidas hip\u00f3teses em escapar aos predadores, alguns zooplanctontes exibem agrega\u00e7\u00f5es junto ao\nConsidera\u00e7\u00f5es finais\nleito da lagoa durante o dia. A migra\u00e7\u00e3o vertical do zoopl\u00e2ncton \u00e9 um mecanismo vital na sobreviv\u00eancia das popula\u00e7\u00f5es zooplanct\u00f3nicas nos lagos profundos e no oceano (Lampert, 1989; Ringelberg, 1995), na medida em que minimiza o impacto enorme da preda\u00e7\u00e3o, apesar dos potenciais custos metab\u00f3licos do ref\u00fagio em profundidade (Dawidowicz &amp; Loose, 1992; Loose &amp; Dawidowicz, 1994). Outra estrat\u00e9gia para reduzir a mortalidade associada a peixes selectivos passa por minimizar o tamanho corporal e maximizar a produ\u00e7\u00e3o de descend\u00eancia. Os dafn\u00edideos s\u00e3o particularmente suscept\u00edveis \u00e0 preda\u00e7\u00e3o, sobretudo a partir do momento da matura\u00e7\u00e3o, em que se tornam demasiado consp\u00edcuos (Taylor &amp; Gabriel, 1992; Gliwicz, 1994). Daphnia longispina isolada da Lagoa da Vela exibiu plasticidade fenot\u00edpica na presen\u00e7a quer de perca-sol, quer de gamb\u00fazia, confirmando que a minimiza\u00e7\u00e3o do tamanho corporal e a maximiza\u00e7\u00e3o da produ\u00e7\u00e3o de neonatos na presen\u00e7a de predadores selectivos continuam estrat\u00e9gias v\u00e1lidas na presen\u00e7a de esp\u00e9cies ex\u00f3ticas.\nEnquanto ci\u00eancia, a Ecologia dedica-se ao estudo dos processos, mecanismos e inter-rela\u00e7\u00f5es entre organismos e interac\u00e7\u00f5es com todos os aspectos (vivos e n\u00e3o vivos) do ambiente que os rodeia. Dentre estes aspectos, a preda\u00e7\u00e3o emerge como determinante do funcionamento dos ecossistemas, sobretudo desde que alguns trabalhos pioneiros (Hrb\u00e1cek et al., 1961; Brooks &amp; Dodson, 1965; Hurlbert et al., 1972) despoletaram essa escola de pensamento. A introdu\u00e7\u00e3o de esp\u00e9cies predadoras afecta os equil\u00edbrios existentes e pode gerar mudan\u00e7as ambientais com consequ\u00eancias imprevis\u00edveis. A compreens\u00e3o, previs\u00e3o e mitiga\u00e7\u00e3o de impactos da mudan\u00e7a ambiental (como a globaliza\u00e7\u00e3o dos recursos pisc\u00edcolas de \u00e1gua doce) reside no aprofundado conhecimento dos ecossistemas e das interac\u00e7\u00f5es entre os organismos, incluindo casos extremos como o da Lagoa da Vela.\nRefer\u00eancias\nAbrantes N., Antunes S.C., Pereira M.J. &amp; Gon\u00e7alves F.
