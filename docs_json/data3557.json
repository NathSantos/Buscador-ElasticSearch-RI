Apart from a few scrappy remains, tentatively assigned only to Cetacea indet., the more significant specimens belong to groups that are mostly pelagic and typical inhabitants of deep and open ocean waters (Mesoplodon sp. and ? Balaenopteridae indet.). Pending further discoveries, the Late Neogene cetaceans from the Azores may prove quite relevant in the establishment of palaeobiogeographic correlations within the North Atlantic, due both to the strategic mid-oceanic location of the archipelago and the rarity of cetacean associations known from the sampled interval in this region.\nRESUMO\nOs A\u00e7ores s\u00e3o bem conhecidos pela sua rica fauna de cet\u00e1ceos actuais.

Less known, both to the general public and the scientific community, is the occurrence of Late Neogene fossils of whales on Santa Maria, the only island in this volcanic archipelago with a significant sedimentary record. These fossils, nevertheless, have long been known by the local population, which commonly refers to them as \"ossos de gigantes\" [bones of giants].\nThe present work reviews the scarce fossil record of cetaceans from Santa Maria, including both the historical occurrences long cited in the literature (but not described), and more recent ones, as yet unpublished, based on specimens deposited in several institutions at the Azores and mainland Portugal (see below). It expands on a preliminary note presented at the 1st \"Atlantic Islands Neogene\", International Congress, held in June 2006 at Ponta Delgada, S\u00e3o Miguel Island (Estevens, 2006a), which was since updated with new information. In addition to a systematic synopsis of all the occurrences so far inventoried, it includes a first appraisal of the palaeoecological and\npalaeobiogeographical significance of the fossil cetacean record from the Azores within the framework of the Late Neogene from Portugal and the North Atlantic region.\nINSTITUTIONAL ABBREVIATIONS\nDBUA-F - Reference Collection of the Fossil Marine Molluscs of the Azores, Marine PalaeoBiogeography Working Group, Biology Department, University of the Azores, Ponta Delgada, S\u00e3o Miguel Island, Azores, PORTUGAL;\nDTP - Private collection of Mr. Dalberto Teixeira Pombo, Vila do Porto, Santa Maria Island, Azores, PORTUGAL;\nMCM - Carlos Machado Museum, Ponta Delgada, S\u00e3o Miguel Island, Azores, PORTUGAL;\nMG/INETI - Geological Museum, National Institute of Engineering, Technology and Innovation, Lisbon, PORTUGAL;\nMMRDC - King D.

A brief inventory of all these occurrences follows, complemented by a short review of their history.\nAlthough the existence of fossil bones on Santa Maria has been seemingly known by the inhabitants of the island for a long time (according to popular knowledge), published references to their occurrence can only be first detected in the 19th century literature, and still, have remained scarce ever since. In fact, only two verified occurrences were previously mentioned in the literature, as the remaining reports are presently regarded as doubtful or clearly erroneous.\nApparently, the first published reference of fossil bones on this island (SMI 1) was reported by Captain E. Boid, an English navy man that, based on personal observations, wrote: \"In a part of this schistose rock on the N.W. side scarcely accessible, is to be seen an immense fossil thighbone of some animal (by the inhabitants called that of a man), which has been, by the erosion of rain, partly freed from its bed, and is now seen projecting from the rock. I offered a considerable sum in order to obtain it, but without success.\" (Boid, 1835: 101). After visiting Santa Maria himself in 1836, the Danish author Carl Friedrich August Grosse (also known as Edouard Romeo, self-proclaimed Count of Vargas de Bedemar), stated for the first time: \"que o grande osso antediluviano, que se dizia existir alli, era unicamente um osso de balea\" [that the large antediluvian bone, that was said to exist there, was only a\nwhale bone] (Bedemar, 1837: 4). Although inaccurate in several points (even in light of early 19th century knowledge), Bedemar's work was quite explicit in the assignment of these bones, for which the ironic criticism that received soon after (Anonymous, 1838: 374) seems rather unjustified. As demonstrated above, and contrary to what was then implied by this unknown author (possibly John White Webster), Bedemar did not regard these bones, erroneously referred to Madeira Island by the same anonymous source, to be the fossil remains of the ancient people of Atlantis. Bedemar's authority on these vertebrate remains would be subsequently cited in a work (Reiss, 1862: 14-15), that added some information about the geographic and stratigraphic provenance of this occurrence when it referred the presence of \"Bruchstucke grosser zelliger Knochen\" [fragments of large cellular bones] in some tuff blocks fallen at the base of \"Ponta da Pescaria\" cliffs, a locality on the northwestern coast of the island currently known as Ponta do Pesqueiro (Fig. 1). Later references to this occurrence include only posthumous reproductions of Bedemar's original work (Bedemar, 1889: 290; 1982: 290), and a citation based on Reiss's work (Zbyszewski &amp; Ferreira, 1962a: 220). The whereabouts of these bones is presently unknown (Estevens, 2006b: 179) and, as suggested by Boid's remarks, may have never been collected at all.\nMalbusca\nPonta do Pesqueiro (SM11)\n\u25a1 Facho-Pico Alto Complex (Pliocene)\nAssumada (SMI 6)\n\u25a1 Touril Complex (Messmian-Zanclean)\nVila do Porto\nSanto Espirito\n\u2022 ' S\u00e3o\nLouren\u00e7o\nFIGURE 1. Location of fossil cetacean localities and occurrences in the Touril Complex (Messinian-Zanclean) of Santa Maria Island (Azores, Portugal).\nThe other published occurrence (SMI 2) relates to some \"fragmentos de vertebras e costellas de cet\u00e1ceo\" [fragments of cetacean vertebrae and ribs], that were included in a collection of fossils from Santa Maria therein gathered by Luiz de Figueiredo Lemos do Canto Corte Real and donated to the Geological Survey of Portugal by Jos\u00e9 Julio Rodrigues (Cotter, 1888-92: 255, 283). According to the latter author, the fossils had no record of geographic provenance (p. 259) and the cetacean bones, in particular, had not been cited in previous lists of fossils from this island (p.\n287), thus reasserting its identity as a separate occurrence. Based on this original reference, it would be cited repeatedly over the years, namely in Teixeira (1950: 212), Cotter (1953: 97, 101) (in a posthumous reproduction of the original work), Ferreira (1955: 15, 37), Zbyszewski &amp; Ferreira (1962b: 288) and Estevens (1998: A161). The referred bones, with no number assigned, are still deposited in cupboard 67, tray 8, of the Stratigraphic Collection of the Geological Museum of this institution, now named the INETI (Estevens, 2006b: 180), and are par\ntially described and illustrated below for the first time.\nOther historical bibliographic references to vertebrate remains found in the sedimentary rocks of Santa Maria Island could not be presently confirmed as belonging to cetaceans.\nSome \"Knochen-formige Kalk-konkretionen\" [bone-shaped calcareous concretions], long noticed in a fossiliferous bed of the section at Pinheiros cliff (Reiss, 1862: 13), were later interpreted as constituting \"ossos de cet\u00e1ceos\" [cetacean bones] (Zbyszewski et al.,\t1961:\t11;\nZbyszewski, 1962: 688), just to be soon again recognized as nothing more than \"concr\u00e9tions en forme d'ossements\" [bone-shaped concretions] (Zbyszewski &amp; Ferreira, 1962a: 218).\nAlthough not specifically attributed to cetaceans, a few \"fragmentos de pequenos ossos\" [fragments of small bones] were also noted in a level of tuffs in the section between Almagreira and Praia, on a slope facing the southern coast (Zbyszewski et al., 1961: 10, 13; Zbyszewski, 1962: 691). Due to the reportedly small size of the bones, their assignment to Cetacea seems unlikely, although not completely impossible.\nAll remaining occurrences correspond to unpublished material housed in Portuguese institutions, some of which resulting from historic collecting (and only recently recognized among collections), whilst others were found during rather recent expeditions (Table 1).\nTwo of the historic findings are deposited at the Carlos Machado\nMuseum, and were supposedly collected and donated by Priest Ernesto Ferreira, possibly during the early 20th century. One of the occurrences (SMI 3) consists of three separate fragments of bone (a larger rib portion and two smaller rib fragments of a mysticete whale), each of which partially encased in its own block of dark grey volcanic tuff, but all included under the same catalogue number (MCM 108). The other occurrence (SMI 4) corresponds to a large cetacean vertebra that has an attached block of light calcareous matrix (MCM 114). Both lack information about their provenance, but the rather different types of associated matrix suggest that the two occurrences may have come from distinct localities.\nTwo other occurrences were collected later in the 20th century by the same person, Mr. Dalberto Teixeira Pombo, but had different repository destinations (Table 1). One is a cetacean vertebra found in Figueiral (SMI 5), the only locality near the southern coast of the island (Fig. 1), that Mr. Pombo keeps in his private collection at Vila do Porto (personal communication of Patricia Madeira). The other is an odontocete rostrum fragment collected in April 1984 at Assumada (SMI 6), a locality also in the northwestern part of the island, but further inland (Fig. 1). This rostrum is currently deposited at the King D. Carlos Sea Museum as specimen MMRDC-R/2003/02/0841, where it was originally catalogued as MMRDC 6260 (personal communication of Carlos Marques da Silva).\nThe last four fossil occurrences resulted from recent expeditions made to Santa Maria Island by the team of the Marine PalaeoBiogeography Working Group (MPB) and collaborators (Table 1), and are all deposited in the Reference Collection of the Fossil Marine Molluscs of the Azores (DBUA-F). All originate from Pedreira da Cr\u00e9, a locality near Ba\u00eda da Cr\u00e9, on the northwestern coast of the island (Fig. 1). The first such occurrence (SMI 7) was collected in July 26, 2001 and consists of a rather eroded, undetermined small fragment of bone (DBUA-F 123-13). The second (SMI\n8)\tis a large rib portion broken in two fragments, that were collected on two separate occasions. The first fragment, catalogued as DBUA-F 163, was discovered and excavated on June 25, 2002, during a visit framed within the 1st workshop \u201cPalaeontology in Atlantic Islands -Marine Fossils of the Azores: perspectives for the future\". The second fragment, numbered DBUA-F 401, was recovered from the same locality on June 17, 2006, during the \u201cPalaeontology in Atlantic Islands 3rd International Workshop\". Although not formally published, the original fragment was briefly mentioned in Estevens (2006b: 180). The third (SMI\n9)\tand fourth (SMI 10) recent fossil occurrences both consist of small rib fragments, one discovered on May 22, 2005 (DBUA-F 194), and the other likewise collected on June 17, 2006, during the \u201cPalaeontology in Atlantic Islands 3rd International Workshop\" (DBUA-F 402).\nAlthough not all could be definitely positioned geographically and/or strati graphically, the 10 occurrences listed in Table 1 compose the currently known record of fossil whales in the Azores, and thus constitute the basis of this study.\nSTRATIGRAPHIC SETTING\nThe existence of fossiliferous sediments of Tertiary age on Santa Maria Island has been known for nearly 150 years, and was the object of study ever since (Hartung, 1860, 1864; Reiss, 1862).\nThese marine sedimentary rocks were traditionally regarded as belonging to a single Late Miocene stratigraphic unit, intercalated between eruptive volcanic complexes that underlie and overlie it (Agostinho, 1937; Teixeira, 1950). Based on its macrofaunal content, the sedimentary unit was broadly dated from the \"Vindobonian\" (Ferreira, 1955; Zbyszewski et al., 1961; Zbyszewski, 1962), with a slight tendency towards the Tortonian (Zbyszewski &amp; Ferreira, 1962a, 1962b). The study of the microfauna, namely the planktonic and benthonic foraminifera, pointed instead to a Late Miocene-Pliocene age (Krejci-Graf et al., 1958), apparently corroborated by later radiometric dating of some lava beds lying below, above and amid the sediments, as a whole framed between 6-3 Ma (Abdel-Monem et al., 1968, 1975; Feraud et al., 1980, 1984).\nRevision of the paleontological data, coupled with detailed stratigraphic field studies (Serralheiro &amp; Madeira, 1993; Serralheiro, 2003), led to the recognition of two separate Neogene units containing fossilifer-ous marine strata: the oldest unit, named Touril Complex, is dated from the Messinian-Zanclean (6.0-\n4.8\tMa) and consists mostly of shallow marine sediments, with few intercalations of lava flows and pyroclastic materials; the youngest unit, designated Facho-Pico Alto Complex, is entirely assignable to the Pliocene (4.8-3.0 Ma) and contains fewer deposits of beach facies, for the most part subordinated to eruptive volcanic materials.\nThe confined distribution of the known cetacean localities to the western part of the island, where only Touril Complex marine sediments occur, restricts the provenance of most of the fossils herein described to this stratigraphic unit (Fig. 1). This hypothesis is further reinforced (and tentatively extended to the fossil remains of unknown origin) by the fact that the Touril Complex is the most fossiliferous rock unit on the island, and that the more restricted beach deposits of the Facho-Pico Alto Complex seem to constitute a less appropriate facies.\nSYSTEMATICS\nClass Mammalia Linnaeus, 1758 Order Cetacea Brisson, 1762 Suborder Odontoceti Flower, 1864 Superfamily Ziphioidea (Gray,\n1865) Gray, 1868\nFamily Ziphiidae Gray, 1865 Subfamily Hyperoodontinae (Gray, 1866) Muizon, 1991\nGenus Mesoplodon Gervais, 1850 Mesoplodon sp. (Figs. 2A-C)\nMaterial. MMRDC-R/2003/02/ 0841 (formerly MMRDC 6260), a medial fragment of a ventral portion of rostrum (occurrence SMI 6).\nDescription. Short fragment of a worn medial section of an edentulous odontocete rostrum, that is transversely broken by a clean, sloping fracture throughout its entire length, thus lacking most of the dorsal region. As preserved, the fragment measures 193 mm in greatest length, 51 mm in greatest width (approximately at mid-length), and 32 mm in greatest height (at the proximal end).\nThe lack of the dorsal region makes it possible to see that the mesorostral canal is completely filled with extremely dense, osteosclerotic bone (Fig. 2A). This dense bone occupies most of the width of the rostrum in dorsal view, except for two narrow strips of nearly fused maxilla and premaxilla that lie adjacent to this medial, denser region on both sides. At the anterior end, only the medial denser ossification of the vomer remains, with the more cancellous bone of the maxilla and premaxilla greatly eroded. Vomer, maxilla and premaxilla seem to be mainly pachyostotic and fused throughout most of the fragment, thus suggesting that the specimen belonged to an adult male (Mead, 1989).\nDue to the inclination of the trans-\npremaxilla\npremaxilla-maxilla suture \\\nV,. mesorostral ossification maxilla\t,\n/\tof the vomer\n09??\nvomer-maxilla suture\npalatine sulci ?\ninternal canal\nFIGURE 2.

All ' 0.5.\n\nverse fracture of the fragment, the right side is comparatively more complete in lateral view (Fig. 2B). On this side, part of the anteriorly inclined premaxilla-maxilla suture can be faintly recognized. Most of the height of the fragment is thus constituted by the maxilla. The ventral profile is slightly concave from end to end, possibly because of some degree of erosion at the medial portion of the ventral region. This concavity causes\nthe rostrum fragment to be lower at mid-length and higher at the proximal and distal ends, with the latter apparently also curving dorsally (probably exaggerated due to erosion of this region).\nAlthough also somewhat worn in the middle region (i.e., possibly flatter than originally), the ventral surface is the better preserved region (Fig. 2C). The sutures between the vomer and the maxilla can barely be distin\nguished, but the ventral exposure of the vomer was surely wider near the proximal end (22 mm), narrower near the distal end (10 mm), and would widen again slightly towards the apex. Due to erosion of the antero-lat-eral margins, part of the paired canals that run through the inside of the rostrum are exposed on both sides at the anterior third of the fragment (26 mm apart). The left canal also pierces the fractured dorsal surface, indicating that the canals would incline noticeably to the ventral side towards the anterior region (the right canal reappears only at the proximal end of the fragment, due to the greater preserved height on this side). The only other recognizable structures on the ventral surface are two elongated shallow depressions located on both sides of the mid-line at mid-length of the fragment, which could represent the anterior ends of the palatine sulci.\nAs can be ascertained from the more complete proximal end, the rostrum would probably be elliptical to somewhat laterally compressed in cross section.\nDiscussion. The cylindrical to laterally compressed shape of the rostrum, together with the lack of dental alveoli and the strong mesorostral ossification of the vomer, readily identify MMRDC-R/2003/02/0841 as a portion of rostrum of Ziphiidae and, particularly, of the genus Mesoplodon Gervais, 1850.\nA specific assignment is more difficult though, due to the fragmentary condition of the specimen. Isolated rostra are the most common fossils of\nZiphiidae and, particularly, of Mesoplodon (Bianucci, 1997). Several species have been described based on incomplete rostra, most of which are not considered valid at present (see for instance Bianucci, 1997 about the numerous Italian specimens). A single fossil species, M. longirostris (Cuvier, 1823), has been consistently recognized by different authors in Neogene sediments exposed in several parts of the world: early Middle Miocene to Early Pliocene of Florida (Whitmore et al., 1986; Morgan, 1994), the Early Pliocene of North Carolina (Whitmore, 1994), the Late Miocene (?) of Antwerp (not as frequently as thought by Abel, 1905, but surely present according to Lambert, 2005), the Pliocene of Italy (revised by Bianucci, 1997), and the Early pliocene of Australia (Glaessner, 1947; Fordyce, 1982; Fitzgerald, 2004).\nMMRDC-R/2003/02/0841 is similar to some of the specimens assigned to this extinct species in the referred literature (for instance Whitmore et al., 1986 or Bianucci, 1997), namely in general dimensions, elliptical cross section, supposed elongation of rostrum, supposed exposure of vomer on dorsal surface and very pointed and anteriorly extending palatine sulci (if the paired depressions on the ventral surface do in fact correspond to those structures). However, due to its fragmentary condition, the Santa Maria rostrum can be safely assigned only to Mesoplodon sp., inasmuch as the taxon M. longirostris may also include more than one fossil species and constitute, in fact, a form species (Whitmore et\nal., 1986; Morgan, 1994; Bianucci, 1997).\nSuborder Mysticeti Flower, 1864\n?

MCM 108 comprises a 137 mm long fragment of the medial region of a large right rib.

All z 0.25.\ncovers most of its antero-medial surfaces, and is too short to allow the definite recognition of any longitudinal curvature (Fig. 3A-B). The shape of its cross-section changes somewhat from the proximal to the distal end. The proximal view shows a convex\nlateral surface and a concavo-convex medial surface, with the greatest diameter located near the anterior edge (Fig. 3C). The distal view also shows the greatest diameter nearer the anterior edge, but is more transversely compressed, with less convex\nlateral and medial surfaces (Fig. 3D). Although eroded (Fig. 3B), the keel at the posterior edge is thus more acute than that at the anterior edge (Fig. 3C-D). The other two associated rib fragments of MCM 108 (smaller, more incomplete and not illustrated here) are also encrusted in blocks of matrix, and only partially exposed. Both have greatest measurable diameters between 40-42 mm, although the smallest is reduced to half of its diameter, showing the inner core of cancellous bone.\nMCM 114 is a somewhat eroded, large-sized lumbar vertebra, which is essentially reduced to the centrum (Fig. 4A-B). As preserved, the main obtainable measurements are: 185 mm in greatest length and, at the pos-\nterior epiphysis, 180 mm in width and 125 mm in height (incomplete). Although too incomplete to be measured, as it lacks most of the left ven-tro-lateral region (Fig. 4A), the anterior epiphysis would be considerably larger than the better preserved posterior one, which maintains an elliptical shape (Fig. 4B). Both are, however, fused to the centrum, thus indicating an adult individual. There is also a large block of matrix encrusting the right dorso-lateral surface of the vertebra, and covering most of the dorsal surface of the right transverse process. Both transverse processes are broken near their bases, barely projecting from the centrum. Otherwise, the vertebra is extensively eroded both on its dorsal and ventral\nFIGURE 5.

It measures approximately 196 mm in length, 84 mm in greatest antero-posterior diameter and 54 mm in greatest transverse diameter (both at the proximal end). The antero-posterior diameter tapers noticeably towards the distal end, mostly due to a strong curvature of the posterior edge (Fig. 5A-B). A gentle lateral bow is also noticeable in anterior or posterior views (Fig. 5C-D). Moderately acute keels run the whole length of both the anterior and posterior edges in a diagonal line, being somewhat more pronounced near the proximal end (Fig. 5C-D). The cross-section of the rib fragment changes in shape throughout its length, from fairly sigmoidal at the proximal end to approximately ovate at the distal end. (Fig. 5E-F). The surface of the fragment is somewhat corroded all over, and additionally covered by a great number of shallow, circularshaped depressions, approximately 10 mm in diameter, that are most likely due to bioerosion.\nDBUA-F 401 was the second fragment of the occurrence SMI 8 to be collected (Fig. 6A), and judging from its more robust cross-section (Fig. 6B), it seems to be the proximal continuation of DBUA-F 163. It is generally similar to the latter, even in the presence of the circular bioerosion markings, but shows an even more concavo-convex lateral and medial surfaces that, coupled with the different positions of the greatest\nconvexities, further accentuates the sigmoidal shape of the cross-section (Fig. 6B).\nDiscussion. Both the large rib fragments and the isolated vertebra do not constitute significantly diagnostic elements, but at least a tentative familial assignment may be advanced. Although quite short, the rib portions MCM 108 and DBUA-F 163 + DBUA-F 401, as well as the MCM 114 vertebra, are all of considerable dimensions and would surely belong to some largesized mysticete cetaceans. All are in fact compatible with the corresponding skeletal elements known for some members of the Balaenopteridae, a family with several fossil representatives in the North Atlantic region during the Messinian-Zanclean (see Demere, 1986 and Demere et al, 2005). Consequently, only a familial and yet tentative assignment to ? Balaenopteridae indet. is here suggested for all three occurrences.\nCetacea indet.\nSuborder undetermined (Figs. 7A-B, 8)\nMaterial.

Boid (1835) referred originally to an \"immense fossil thigh-bone\" and both Bedemar (1837) and Reiss (1862) reported that the bones, although not specified, were of large dimensions and had cancellous texture, descriptions also given by Zbyszewski &amp; Ferreira (1962a). This, and the references to \"whale\" by Bedemar (1837) and Reiss (1862), suggest that these undetermined remains may have consisted of some large (limb?) cetacean bone (or bones?).\nFIGURE 7. DBUA-F 194, a small rib fragment assigned to Cetacea indet. (occurrence SMI 9). A - Outer view, B - Inner view. All ' 1.\nThe vertebra that constitutes the occurrence SMI 5 is deposited in a private collection (DTP) and could not be directly examined during this study, but according to indirect accounts (Patr\u00edcia Madeira) is of large dimensions and may be also assigned to a cetacean.\nSpecimens deposited in the DBUA-F collection are all too fragmentary and can only be superficially described. DBUA-F 194 and DBUA-F 402 can both be recognized as small fragments of ribs, reduced to about half of its width, where the inner core of cancellous bone may be distinguished from the more compact outer cortex (Fig. 7A-B). DBUA-F 123-13, on the other hand, is reduced to a mere fragment of rather cancellous, internal bone, not definitely assignable to any particular skeletal element.\nMost of the bones grouped under MG/INETI unnumbered are quite eroded and reduced to rather small sizes (Fig. 8), and not all can be assigned to particular skeletal elements. Some seem to be small fragments of ribs (between 31 and 59 mm long), mostly preserving only the outer, denser cortical layer of bone, with little of the inner core of cancellous bone remaining (mid-upper row and middle row in Fig. 8). Others, although larger (60 to 97 mm in greatest length), are notably cancellous all over and essentially shapeless due to erosion (upper left and right corners in Fig. 8). Still, the presence of apparent foramina in one of them suggests that they could consist of eroded vertebral centra, which could be the basis for Cotter's (1888-92) reference\nFIGURE 8. MG/INETI unnumbered, vertebral? and rib fragments assigned to Cetacea indet. (occurrence SMI 2). Scale bar = 10 cm.\nto both \"ribs and vertebrae\" among this association. The larger and most important element is a somewhat eroded medial portion of a rib, diagonally fractured in two separate fragments (lower row in Fig. 8). This 200 mm long portion of rib is noticeably curved longitudinally and slightly compressed transversely, with greater and lesser preserved diameters at mid-length of 40 mm and 32 mm, respectively. Most notable, and quite the opposite of the remaining rib fragments, this specimen shows a comparatively more cancellous cortical layer (5 mm in width), surrounding a noticeably osteosclerotic inner core of bone with few macroscopically visible canals throughout its entire\npreserved length. Such features of the ribs, most likely responsible for the better preservation of this fragment, have previously been recorded among cetaceans only in some Eocene archaeocetes and a few Oligocene archaic mysticetes (summarized in Fordyce &amp; Watson, 1998), with no definite records among postPaleogene cetaceans and, even less, Late Neogene ones.\nDiscussion. Such fragmentary material obviously lacks the diagnostic characters that may allow detailed classification, but the overall cancellous nature of most of the bones (with the notable exception of the osteosclerotic rib fragment in MG/INETI\nunnumbered), and the inferred large size of several elements, suggests a most probable assignment to Cetacea indet.\nPALEOECOLOGICAL AND PALEOBIOGEOGRAPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS\nAlbeit limited, the fossils from Santa Maria provide an opportunity to draw some preliminary considerations, regarding the palaeoecology of the Messinian-Zanclean seas of this region and the palaeobiogeographic relationships of its cetacean faunas.\nRegarding palaeoecological conditions, it is noteworthy that the most significant fossil occurrences belong to groups whose living representatives are mostly pelagic, such as large baleen and beaked whales (mostly Balae-nopteridae and Ziphiidae), all typical inhabitants of deep and open ocean waters (Fordyce &amp; Muizon, 2001) and still present around the Azores today (Reiner et al., 1993). This suggests that the Late Neogene Azorean seas, much like today, were well separated from the continental shelf, thus allowing for these pelagic species to come rather close to the island coast.\nAlthough meagre, the Azorean fossil record also increases our knowledge of Late Neogene (8-3 Ma) eastern midAtlantic cetaceans, and builds on the correlative record known from the Portuguese mainland, which consist only of fragmentary remains of undetermined odontocetes and mysticetes (Estevens, 2006b, 2006c).\nRegarding palaeobiogeographic\nrelationships, the Azorean fossil fauna may prove to be quite relevant in the establishment of correlations within the North Atlantic realm, mostly due to the strategic mid-oceanic location of the archipelago. At the moment, and pending further discoveries, tentative comparisons may be established with such approximately contemporaneous (Mes-sinian-Zanclean) faunas as those from the Eastover (\u00bb 7.2-6.1 Ma) and Yorktown (\u00bb 4.8-3.0 Ma) formations from the Middle Atlantic Coastal Plain (Gottfried et al, 1994; Whitmore, 1994); the Palmetto Fauna (\u00bb 5.2-4.5 Ma) from Florida (Morgan, 1994; Hulbert et al, 2001); and the Kattendijk (\u00bb 5.0-4.4 Ma) and Lillo (\u00bb 4.2-2.6 Ma) formations from Belgium (Hampe, 1996; Demere et al, 2005). Although unevenly studied, all of these associations share a noticeable modern character, being largely dominated by living groups such as the rorquals (Balaenopteridae) and right whales (Balaenidae) among the mys-ticetes, and true dolphins (Delphinidae) and beaked whales (Ziphiidae) among the odontocetes, somewhat like the meagre Azorean fossil fauna described in this paper.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe scarce record of fossil cetaceans herein reported indicates that more significant remains may be expected to be found in the Late Neogene marine sediments of Santa Maria Island. The fact that four out of the ten known occurrences resulted from recent expeditions to the island suggests that this is, indeed, a promising area. The discov\nery of more complete cetacean remains would be rather important, considering the geographic position of the Azores, and the potential for varied palaeobiogeographic correlations within the North Atlantic realm. The particular stratigraphic interval sampled (Mes-sinian-Zanclean) is also relevant, since it constitutes one of the periods whose cetacean faunas are poorly known within the North Atlantic. Finally, and just as interesting, is the role played by these whale fossils in the local folklore and history of Santa Maria Island, popular references of which may be traced back a few centuries.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to Carlos Marques da Silva (Faculty of Sciences, University of Lisbon) and Patr\u00edcia Madeira (MPB/DB) for providing information relating to historical and recent occurrences of cetacean fossils in Santa Maria, and to Nuno Mendes (MPB) for help with the examination and photography of DBUA-F specimens.
